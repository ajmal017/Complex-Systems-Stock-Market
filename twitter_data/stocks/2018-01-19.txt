66 2018-01-21 23:17:45 Think of coins like stocks or securities, except that unlike securities the holder has no claim against the company if they bankrupt.  Which is why the have no regs.  Also, unlike stocks, you spend them in the companies ecosystem unless you are simply speculating on coin value

86 2018-01-21 22:59:36 pretty straightforward this one. Not one person in the media or fandom can legitimately say the pats have had more favourable calls than the opposition without blatantly lying. *IF* we win, it's the hardest earned victory in years (including the superbowl).

111 2018-01-21 22:47:29 It's more than just stocks in general - EVERYTHING about the current economy is skyrocketing!  TRILLIONS of US Dollars are being repatriated, good-paying jobs coming back from overseas, unemployment at record lows, and it all stems from having a @PotUS who understands business!
112 2018-01-21 22:46:56 I hear you on shooting film though. I enjoy shooting film a lot more than digital these days. The fact film requires a lot less editing (minus scratch/dust removal in my case) is a big bonus. It’s nice to just let the different film stocks characteristics shine.

128 2018-01-21 22:39:51 Come on Brady finish this !!
129 2018-01-21 22:39:41 Actually no. Anyone in the financial field doesn't talk Dow as it on looks at 30 stocks where as the S&P 500 looks at 500 stocks giving a more accurate result.

Any finance 101 course discusses that and I know for certain it's part of studying to pass the series 7 exam.
130 2018-01-21 22:39:21 Funny but if the dows up then business have more money in their stocks and that means to do this crazy thing like produce more product, which means hiring more people, which means those people buying more of their product, see the circle...crazy how economics works isnt it...

141 2018-01-21 22:34:49 Sorry one last thing forgot to say @Twitter pls make an edit tweet button.... Relating back to crypto/blockchain. But I believe investing in these has a lot of power to cause economic/political/social change. people treating it like stocks is what is holding back its utility
142 2018-01-21 22:33:45 @ChrisWesseling Patriots classically keeping the stocks moving with WRs running a lot of comeback routes

144 2018-01-21 22:31:01 They obviously don't know shit about the valuation of Bitcoin for crypto currency in general you should stick to commenting on their articles about their shitty stocks
145 2018-01-21 22:30:38 @Warburtons do you still sell potato cakes? Haven’t been able to find them for about six months in Leeds, Gloucester and Manchester? Got serious cravings  would buy 100 packs and freeze them if u can tell me where stocks them
146 2018-01-21 22:29:34 That is correct. I did like it because I believed the strategy of investing in Blockchain technology was on point. That said, I’ve moved on to other stocks because I don’t like the association ay longer.
147 2018-01-21 22:29:24 .@funder #TrumpShutdown is a ploy by Republicans to make mo ey. Its always about the money. No way would Trump let the markets drop. Its the only thing he has going 4 him. But the 1% tax breaks can buy back there stocks for penny's on the Dollar. WATCH THE STOCKS
148 2018-01-21 22:28:19 bull shit , stocks do not mean we are doing better.
149 2018-01-21 22:27:08 @collin_davison @DrOz Sustainably raised salmon are given the same natural components of krill and algae to get their color as wild does. There are sustainable feed models that help balance demand on wild stocks while providing a nutritious protein that people love to eat.
150 2018-01-21 22:26:31 I think bump stocks are pointless personally. The NRA contributes to both parties and the $ are far less than most seem to think. The notion the GOP is run on NRA dollars is laughable. The NRA to the chagrin of certain hardliners actually supports common sense  gun control.

153 2018-01-21 22:25:03 I have stock and I voted for him to improve my stocks and I am so glad I did.  Is it up 42% since Trump came into to office?
154 2018-01-21 22:23:02 Oh Dang! I just went today and it seemed like they were between seasons so maybe they are getting rid of the winter stuff and stocking spring so stocks are weird.

159 2018-01-21 22:17:49 Highly intrigued-I also trade in stocks-This could have HUGE potential and would in fact change a lot..Gotta point out the boast where they have the largest Instagram-saw that on an $ETN they should since they force you to join ;-)  #polymath #stocks #crypto #cryptocurrency $btc
160 2018-01-21 22:15:32 Good for you Lester. I know 2 'advisers' very well - both with large insurance co's selling unit trusts and when their clients ask about individual stocks they phone me. As @Sandilekhowane says, never bought a stock in their lives & wouldn't know one if it fell on them.
161 2018-01-21 22:15:27 DM @Watchdogsniffer Word on Wall Street is that Trump and his Russian  Mafiya handlers are shorting on defence stocks.

164 2018-01-21 22:12:42 $ZCL panic sellers coming back? :) Could have made a nice 40% there on down and up moves!! Lesson from this is drink less trade better

166 2018-01-21 22:12:38 I really love @CollectifLondon and I own like 3 of their dresses (which I bought from somewhere that stocks them) but this is singlehandedly the worst experience of trying to shop online I've ever had holy moly
167 2018-01-21 22:11:00 Last week was the 9th week in a row that the Dow had held the previous week's low. This sequence has extended to 10 weeks only once in the 404 weeks since 23 April 2010, the exception coming on 22 April 2016, 92 weeks ago #stocks
168 2018-01-21 22:10:25 Remember legislation to ban bump stocks after the Vegas massacre? Another lie from the GOP. They’ve proven over & over again that they CANNOT BE TRUSTED.
169 2018-01-21 22:10:00 The Dow has rallied for 16 of the last 19 weeks, adding a total of 4274 points (+19.6%), making this the biggest 19 week gain seen in the 426 weeks since 20 November 2009 #stocks

172 2018-01-21 22:03:09 I know a lot here don't DYOR but just a reminder there are other stocks in the Ords that aren't involved in Lithium which look interesting. The rotation has moved on from EV at the present, where is it rotating to now?
173 2018-01-21 22:00:58 Interesting. I don’t really see a need for Bump stocks either. Otherwise you are fine, no mag restrictions, etc?
174 2018-01-21 22:00:37 Y’all investing into penny stocks and stuff that’s gonna be dead in a couple months lmao
175 2018-01-21 21:59:34 You do realize that Bump stocks are just a short cut way of using the bump fire technique right? If a shooter has 15 minutes, YouTube, and a belt loop, he can still do it. I think you heart is in the right place, but the things your advocating change nothing.
176 2018-01-21 21:59:01 Bad? Sure. Real bad? Yuh-huh. But Civil War bad? No, sir. Bush was easily the worst (knock on wood) of our young lifetimes, but I agree that 1850-70 is the sweet spot of the failed executive. The Trump era, however, is yet young.
177 2018-01-21 21:58:47 Yeah we did that already, your less then stellar candidate had no platform, no message, and no turn out. Tell us please, what is the dem message? What are they running on? I hear nothing but bitterness. Meanwhile stocks r up unempl is down,  and Trump's squeezing them by the wall
178 2018-01-21 21:58:28 Then I guess I'm gonna buy stocks in some line companies
179 2018-01-21 21:58:12 I missed the $ZCL announcement about fork date and dump. Afterwards I logged in to Bittrex think about joining in high-low game but then I realized I had too much to drink to do that without regrets   So best is to keep calm on a Sunday night I think :)
180 2018-01-21 21:57:44 If the companies that are represented by the stocks have the same problem, earnings will be hit and there will be a much larger problem.

 Like you said the government can’t even regulate Bump stocks. How can they be relied upon to keep keep us safe and free?
183 2018-01-21 21:56:29 I’ve added it to my wish list of books. I see it was published in 2008 - I thought some fishing stocks have made a resurgence, with marine protected areas in part helping -?
184 2018-01-21 21:56:29 Tes stocks de memes sont intéressants, je me demande d'où ils proviennent 
185 2018-01-21 21:55:49 I support the right to own guns.

I would like to see bump stocks banned, (please don't mention rubber bands)
186 2018-01-21 21:55:10 Damn bump-stocks
187 2018-01-21 21:55:04 Hi Owen. Guns are not heavily regulated. It is very easy to get guns. Bump stocks to convert semi to fully automatic remain (astoundingly) legal. Las Vegas and the families affected by the October music festival massacre deserve better. At least honesty.
188 2018-01-21 21:53:56 False info stocks have not traded up since the shut down because futures markets have been closed.  Hate the word but “fake news”.
189 2018-01-21 21:53:48 If that is true, then there is a reason why the #government puts rules in place to make trading #crypto safer. But if it false, then saying that would be producing ignorance because, like with #stocks, #bonds, and #fiatcurrency, there is risk-taking involved. Smart decisions FTW!
190 2018-01-21 21:52:55 So I’ve started investing in stocks and i think I’m addicted and i see why people do it
191 2018-01-21 21:51:53 think stocks.....
192 2018-01-21 21:51:16 I know. :) I intend to eat all the seafood, all the pasta and all the dessert and well as put a sizable dent in Sicilian wine stocks.
193 2018-01-21 21:50:52 when stocks went up 148 percent under O yall said a President has no impact. Now spiking the ball over 25 percent???
194 2018-01-21 21:50:24 What makes a job 'dispensable'? Algorithms are already better at trading stocks than humans, robot pharmacists don't make mistakes, why stop at service jobs..?
195 2018-01-21 21:49:45 Jobs, stocks, tax reform, not a political, telling it like it is.
196 2018-01-21 21:48:22 Well, we all know how trustworthy the Republicans are. Remember them getting rid of bump stocks after the massacre in Vegas? Yeah, me neither.

209 2018-01-21 21:32:52 As if the Co-Op at the top of my road now stocks @peerlessbrewing absolute game-changer!
210 2018-01-21 21:32:46 Without the EU, UK waters would be an underwater desert. Stocks are only now recovering after decades of over fishing. Those  in the industry who wanted to leave or diversify have been well looked after financially.
211 2018-01-21 21:32:34 Semi auto is not easy to change. Bump stocks our way to get around semi auto but it is still semi auto.

Bump stocks have one purpose: increase body counts

Automatic weapons have one purpose: increase body counts

The sickness is @GOP that cares more about welfare of unborn people than those walking the Earth.

217 2018-01-21 21:24:17 The party that is stripping healthcare from millions of Americans and won't take action to ban bump-stocks or pass other gun legislation wants to tell you the other party is complicit for murder b/c of the #TrumpShutdown
218 2018-01-21 21:22:58 @RockstarSupport it was the issue with the phone in gta 5 on xbox 360 where the internet & map dissapear right away when I go onto the internet browser to order cars or to look up stocks.  Also the character wheel changer dissapears after I try to get onto the internet.
219 2018-01-21 21:22:23 Bear markets, even technical ones, tend to turn on a change in fundamentals. We don't have that yet. In fact, we continue to see increasing stocks on hand.
220 2018-01-21 21:21:55 It's disgusting how people like Titus stand on the bodies of the dead to remove people's right to defend themselves. How about this: if the 558 killed all had guns with bump stocks how do you think the incident would have ended? @OwenBenjamin
221 2018-01-21 21:19:34 #Lithium UBS analyst says the SQM deal won't affect lithium supplies for the next 4 or 5 years given the time required to build the expansions so no need to worry Monday all Lithium stocks looks likely to rebound!!!
222 2018-01-21 21:19:20 Stocks have been going up for years.  However, not all Americans can afford to invest. They have been left behind while corporations hang onto their cash.

224 2018-01-21 21:18:39 that is my concern about MJ stocks, so many people at work/play who don't have never bought a stock in their life are telling me to get into this sector now as come July it is going to explode. I am thinking if they are only hearing about it now who will be left in July?

230 2018-01-21 21:15:44 Because of dangerous minds like yours.

I invested heavily in bump stocks, but got screwed by wall street and your leftist friends.

Now I'm saving for a tank.

233 2018-01-21 21:05:35 They’re too worried about marijuana and bump stocks.
234 2018-01-21 21:01:25 Smash 64 is underrated. Yes, it takes a long time (used to be 5 stocks, now 4). It’s insane to me what people can do in that game.

237 2018-01-21 20:55:15 (2/2) To be a scam that was primarily pushed by Republicans & Russian Troll Operatives, the people who pushed it will be laughing stocks and lose credibly. Something Similar happened to Hannity. If you truly believe it's a scam, you should be pushing #ReleaseTheMemo too
238 2018-01-21 20:54:09 Many own stocks whether large or small amounts. My 401k has really grown since Trump took office
239 2018-01-21 20:52:00 When you invest in stocks you have Buy > Hold > Sell, when you invest in crypto you have Buy > HODL > Use.

241 2018-01-21 20:51:48 Yes my point, the D's put a bill before the Senate to make Bump Stocks illegal after the Vegas Shooting. The GOP killed it, according to the Trump commercial any other murders using Bump Stocks, GOP would be Complicit. Don't know what point you are defending? "Very Stable Genius
242 2018-01-21 20:48:53 I’m like addicted to buying more stocks
243 2018-01-21 20:46:58 Algún chino estará untándolos para que lo liberen de stocks.
244 2018-01-21 20:46:34 What is the basis for that argument, tho? If a publicly traded company issues a lower-than-expected dividend, the price immediately falls because, for many investors, and many stocks, it's not a speculative investment. It's based on their track record of producing dividends.
245 2018-01-21 20:46:33 goth babes are out hippy babes are in sell your stocks buy stocks in girls with names like rainfire and treelog or crispyleaf
246 2018-01-21 20:46:14 1. The stock market alone is not an accurate depiction of how the economy is doing because companies can just buy back stocks to raise their prices
2. Of COURSE they fixate on comments. The words of the President matter! He is our spokesperson to the rest of the world!
247 2018-01-21 20:45:54 The shareholders received dividends, but they have lost the value of their shares, so they are actually out of pocket by billions.

David Lammy does not understand capitalism and stocks.

248 2018-01-21 20:45:17 People bought pizzas with Bitcoins which would now be worth millions of dollars...

Exchanging cryptocurrencies like stocks is just a form of gambling.

Some people have been lucky, but the numbers are not that great... More people have been left behind than have been successful

251 2018-01-21 20:40:58 Indeed!!!  Our @POTUS & @FLOTUS are working hard for America and it is showing with jobs coming back, stocks rising and more. Soros controlled Dems are in a downward spiral progressive socialism ideals don't work for USA & on the way out.

257 2018-01-21 20:33:29 The cryptocurrency stock of today is similar to the crazy inflated stocks of the mid to late 1920's. Nothing to back it, non-regulated, but it all worked out. Based on that, I'm all in with my $7,500 tax return.
258 2018-01-21 20:32:07 cant u make it more stocks..
259 2018-01-21 20:31:07 $UAV and $RLV are my 2 favorite early stage <$20 million mkt cap companies with growing revenue, strong management and amazing potential. The slow and steady execution is refreshing compared to the volatile pot and crypto stocks. A great place to park profits for 2018.
260 2018-01-21 20:28:28 Saw it coming. To me legally, bump fire stocks are a modification, or device that lets you shoot your weapon like a machine gun. So I am surprised they were sold on the market in the first place.
261 2018-01-21 20:26:28 Camera folks - other than London Camera Exchange are there any other reputable online 2nd hand dealers with large stocks?

263 2018-01-21 20:24:43 I believe the lives of all Americans would be much improved if agents, attorneys, and officers of the courts were unable to speak. Perhaps the fine arts of barbarous punishments such as flogging, setting in the stocks, tongue-boring, and ear-cropping should be en vogue once more.
264 2018-01-21 20:24:09 I’m not saying it wasn’t bad by him, but on your set stock and down two stocks to 1 at medium percent offstage it’s hard to not autopilot a bit and try to just try to survive as fast as possible
265 2018-01-21 20:22:06 I would never buy #Stocks "pumped" by the #Twitterati. By the time they start it's too late for a reasonable entry and if I own a stock they've targeted I prepare my exit strategy.
266 2018-01-21 20:20:03 Time to buy it will be green never seem red like buying stocks .......FOMO times

272 2018-01-21 20:13:15 With a lot of Volatility & Manipulation on some stocks recently I think there will be a shift to more fundamental sound stocks. Example, $UAV was at .065 cents and hits .25 cents. Co is making money and getting new contracts. The laggers will catch up in a flash imo

277 2018-01-21 20:08:08 Went to a tournament for Melee, played Marth well the first two rounds, but that was because it was against two people who hasn't been to tournaments either, ever or in the past two years. 3rd round I played okay, but the guy choked out 4 stocks over 2 games
278 2018-01-21 20:07:33 This fairytale dems keep pushing that Obama is responsible for great economy is ridiculous. Slowest recovery and growth since great depression. Obama would have missed himself to have stocks this high and creating REAL jobs instead of part time minimum wage.

283 2018-01-21 20:02:01 I'm fairly sure it was an option.... Initially rang re broadband and first thing it did was diagnostic
284 2018-01-21 20:00:46 Is that an option? It's not listed anywhere on its website. It's as if they're only interested in new customers
285 2018-01-21 20:00:17 Not that hard, you must be a "Very Stable Genius"

288 2018-01-21 19:56:01 #Global #Military spending is a #trillion dollar industry, so would it influence #politicians to stimulate tension to justify economically stimulating spending? Military stocks, like #NYSE:LMT, NYSE:SPR, NYSE:NOC have seen strong growth since the #Trump #presidency

292 2018-01-21 19:52:10 i have a 4% or higher scanner on 500k volume that scan for otc / pink sheets.  but when weed went recreational in cali pot stocks soared and they should get thrown on watchlist to see if they re-setup for dailychart breakouts
293 2018-01-21 19:50:05 Do you have a 401k? Savings account? All tied to stocks.  Learn a little.
294 2018-01-21 19:48:03 Yes, which is reflective of a higher LSC (shale) feed stock...or not, there in lies the problem, proving the thesis, as crude feed stocks are not typed by weight.  But PdVSA is not shipping much HC, and KXL was force majeure for some time, limiting WCS heavy crude availability.
295 2018-01-21 19:45:57 Holy Spirit now on special for $8.99 per liter. (While stocks last).
296 2018-01-21 19:45:22 ....to all his loyal fan. McDonalds stock took a huge dip amidst rumors Trump would began a healthier lifestyle and diet. Stocks rebound once they realized it was “fake news “.
297 2018-01-21 19:44:27 The bad part about sell limit orders on MtG cards is that they sit there forever, and then something happens and prices zoom way past the limit. I like stop-loss limit orders on stocks, but not sell limit orders on old MtG cards that tend to build value via big jumps.

300 2018-01-21 19:42:41 I am happy with the #TrumpEconomy
My few stocks have doubled since he came to office and my pension check just figured to go DOWN $200 in taxes per month, which is even less than my 2017 taxes.

302 2018-01-21 19:41:53 HOW did Bary make $20 million, masquerading as POTUS ?  What land did he sell ?  What about stocks ?  Was it a factory that made Bary dolls ? Did he give speeches using AFOne to fly all over the world ? Or did he make it from kick-backs from Hilry, sorros, & other NWOdor elites ?
303 2018-01-21 19:41:27 I don't think. I know. Everyone with stocks and a 401k will vote Trump in next election. Money talks and CNN BS walks.
304 2018-01-21 19:40:50 sir you marry only once but buy many stocks, that is the difference
305 2018-01-21 19:40:03 I literally have no idea . . . I think the bond markets are to be totally avoided and I am staying away and watching to see if yields kick up to level that compete w stocks . . . other than that I'm waiting for normalization to get interested
306 2018-01-21 19:40:03 Remember when it was 5 stocks?
307 2018-01-21 19:37:33 Even though 64 is my favorite Smash, I'm of the opinion that they should all just go to 2 stocks. Gimme that Vampire Savior feeling any day.

310 2018-01-21 19:35:22 Isn't this missing the point? An asset, USD stocks, paying dividends in the currency they're priced in has an equilibrium price. An asset, e.g. BTC, that's unbound from the pricing currency doesn't. In the first case, wash trades are inefficient, but in the 2nd case... what?
311 2018-01-21 19:34:43 Waffle house stocks gonna be soaring on Monday

319 2018-01-21 19:28:11 and what part of the agenda would that be?  He had a very successful year.  I know that my stocks are soring and I got a big raise in my paycheck.
320 2018-01-21 19:27:24 I'm fairly new in crypto,but not new to trading stocks. In Binance, when we sale coins there always that residual amount left behind.If that particular coin goes up to $1000+ in the future,would we be able to withdraw that minus fees ? I know others are prob wondering also.
321 2018-01-21 19:27:24 Funny thing is, it used to be 5 stocks for the longest time. I think they changed it to 4 stocks sometime in 2017.
I wish characters like Falcon and Fox were more popular, they're way more interesting to watch than Pikachu and Kirby
322 2018-01-21 19:27:12 It's funny to me that Smash 64, which is dominated by floaties and slow-ish movement, gets 5 stocks and 8-10 minutes, but Smash 4 is only allowed to have 2 stocks and 6 minutes because it's "too slow"
323 2018-01-21 19:25:51 I hate when the grownups fight. I agree with you both. Lots of  to be made. The momo is here -- regardless of s/s. Follow the volume. What I like about Bird is he doesn't marry his stocks and says what he thinks, whether its popular or not...

332 2018-01-21 19:18:59 S&P earnings yield is increasing despite this impressive run up in stock prices.  The increasing yield suggests more upside for stocks in 2018 as they catch up to forward profit estimates.

334 2018-01-21 19:18:14 Fair enough, I disagree, but that's what makes a market. Stocks basically went nowhere for 14 years from 2000-2014. The bull market prior to 2,000 lasted for 26 years and gained a cumulative 2389%
335 2018-01-21 19:17:39 4 stocks seems like way too many when they're already playing first to 3
336 2018-01-21 19:17:38 You guys should make some good foot stocks too. The competition sucks - I've checked.

You instead build stations on the map and all cities can take only 1.  Use 6 in basic, 5 in Stocks Exp.

360 2018-01-21 18:58:44 He bet the farm on frac sand stocks.  Based on his top 10 holdings, it appears to me like he finally waved the white flag.  Hard to make money last few years in a dedicated energy mandate - unless your short!!!
361 2018-01-21 18:55:45 Ummm the markets don’t represent Americans they represent stocks bonds etc. Shareholders are not all or mostly American. Buys of markets are also not reflective of Americans only.
362 2018-01-21 18:53:10 I don't think it will mate. It's been hyped up through media, it'll all go quiet now. It is effectively stocks and shares, just hope people that haven't researched the risks thoroughly haven't lost a lot of money on it. Everyone doesn't get rich by trading there are always losers

369 2018-01-21 18:48:21 84% of all stocks are held by the 10% wealthiest people. Half of Americans don’t even own stock. The stock market  isn’t an approval rating. It’s just the rich getting richer.

383 2018-01-21 18:32:47 Correct about the only limits on money printing being inflation.  There are 2 symptoms you're nearing "too much" - domestic political populism (check) & foreign Central Banks ceasing to stockpile your debt (check.)  IMO what we r seeing in stocks is a "safety bid" out of USD's

You folks just refuse to get it don’t you? You’d rather stab yourself in the eye than admit Trumps success. Its comical really
400 2018-01-21 18:16:24 He’s gotten so much done in 1 year! Anyone with a 401k, stocks etc. should be very happy. In a couple of weeks paychecks w/ new tax rate will go out nationwide! Businesses R coming back bringing $ Billions back 2 our economy! Unnecessary loopholes closed! Much more! All good!
401 2018-01-21 18:13:57 The @GOP is complicit in all white mass murderous rampages such as Las Vegas, Orlando nightclub, Charleston, San Bernadino. The @GOP and especially Trump have promoted white supremacy and refused to make sensible guns restrictions. They haven't even made bump stocks illegal.
402 2018-01-21 18:13:43 I love watching 3/5 Smash 1 because I can watch game 1, take a bathroom break, run to the grocery store, buy some popcorn, get gas on the way home, make the popcorn, read the entire set histories of the two players, and then pop back in to catch the last two stocks of game 4
403 2018-01-21 18:13:34 EWU is NOT a way to measure valuation of UK stocks, as it is priced in USD. What is FTSE in GBP CAPE?Then evaluate GBP relative to one’s base currency. If FTSE stays flat but GBP/USD goes back to 2.00, will UK stocks then be less cheap?
404 2018-01-21 18:13:29 Better yet LEARN (via inexpensive seminars/webinars) the science-of-money-making-money:  invest in rental properties/Flips, stocks/bonds/Gold&Silver.  INCREASE FINANCIAL IQ/LITERACY.
405 2018-01-21 18:10:58 Perhaps the legislators think they will make a lot of money buying up stocks when the market drops because of the shutdown.

420 2018-01-21 17:57:18 When the market goes up 75% of all stocks go up - When the market goes down 80% of all stocks go down - When your paying 1-2% annually over any rolling 10yr timeframe very few managers beat the index they are competing with - Why overpay to underperform - Buy low fee indexes...

431 2018-01-21 17:46:45 The key question is whether government shutdown causes a small drop in stocks. If not it would be clearest signal to buy and hold the next run up, till the inevitable collapse.

Can’t you figure out what mistake we are making?
We lack patience and often exit from stocks due to panic when prices drop steeply.
Greed drives us to the market and fear pushes us to cut losses and thus, ignoring the long-term fundamentals of a company.
JUST STICK FOR LONG.
445 2018-01-21 17:36:10 I do agree with you about the transfer of wealth. Everyone makes it seem like the stock market is doing so well and that is affecting all Americans however less than half of Americans actually own stocks so most of us are left with nothing, including myself
446 2018-01-21 17:32:52 As to the latter, many more than your post suggests.  Index funds own these stocks, and most retirement plans have those stocks in them.

More volume with less shares, better looking chart, 350 mil in assets, ZERO debt!    It has the best share structure
453 2018-01-21 17:29:38 Not weather related, but very important.

Key things to watch this week are #NAFTA talks & their effect on the North American markets.

If you invest in stocks/funds now's the time to look at international markets outside the U.S/Canada & prepare for a heap of shorting.

466 2018-01-21 17:18:54 This has caused Belgium to look into starting a lawsuit, possibly the US will follow, Rep Chris Lee of Hawaii is trying to start legislation on it, and more immediately EA stocks plummeted. Despite the boxes legally being gambling, Victoria may take no action. Not sure though.
467 2018-01-21 17:18:43 Would you rather be complicit in murders committed by illegal immigrants or complicit in allowing assault rifles, high-capacity magazines, bump stocks, stalling background checks?

That murder scoreboard since November is approximately zero to 57.
468 2018-01-21 17:18:25 Who’d have guessed? CNN REPORT. “The latest rush to buy stocks left the average up almost 8,000 points since President Trump's 2016 election.U.S. unemployment is the lowest in 17 years, corporate profits have never been stronger & companies are sitting on record amounts of cash.”
469 2018-01-21 17:18:09 I would have been too broke, but my mom might have invested.  He couldn't grasp how we buy imaginary items with no physical content, and sell for a different price.  "it's like stocks or a dollar bill.  Someone tells you what it's worth."

478 2018-01-21 17:10:40 The richest 1% of Americans hold about 35% of all privately held wealth in the United States. Meanwhile the bottom 90% hold 73% of all debt. 65% of America owned stocks at the height of the 2007 Financial Crisis, while only 52% (This includes 401(k)s, IRAs) own stock today.

482 2018-01-21 17:09:05 It's the right thing to do.   Bump stocks  are not necessary for any hunter / gun owner.   It doesn't take proof to make this a reasonable deterrent to gun violence.
483 2018-01-21 17:07:59 Retail gold, yes. But there are gold 'stocks'; funds that claim to trade gold for buyers/sellers. My dad owned some. He should've sold when I told him to.

529 2018-01-21 16:27:40 there was an article not so long back titled something like "gay black men the new white men" - ie the latest group in the stocks required to check their privilege...it is hilarious to see these loons eat their own while Rome burns....
530 2018-01-21 16:27:34 any $trx $fct holders out there..you need to look at #ffwd listed on AIM to diversify into stocks if you havent. Do some quick research & see the pot $alts #crypto
531 2018-01-21 16:27:30 Stocks or gallows?
532 2018-01-21 16:25:58 You're On Your Own Disheveled States of America. Attempting to get gun violence and deaths decreased


Facing congressional  inaction, states move to ban bump stocks ?tid=ss_tw-amp
533 2018-01-21 16:24:40 And let's also remember something like 80% of the population doesn't own stocks so their benefit from the market, if any at all, is muted.
534 2018-01-21 16:24:16 Nothing wrong with being invested in weed stocks. I believe in Matica a lot and am hoping it runs high maybe to the $4 land soon with licensing.
535 2018-01-21 16:24:14 I know there’s a lot of people watching $sx still. It’s an interesting story, but some advice would be to start DD into other stocks and clear your mind. One of my trading rules is don’t become emotional... $sx has so many people emotional. Not a good sign even moving forward...
536 2018-01-21 16:23:12 Are u going to trade in all these stocks?
537 2018-01-21 16:22:17 HUGE NEWS: Mikey Pence is getting rich off his stocks while the majority of America is living hand to mouth, starving, homeless, without healthcare, have children who need CHIP to live and he won't help fund the programs.

There. Fixed it for you
538 2018-01-21 16:22:15 32 or so divisions in about two weeks. Anyway my point throughout was that we didn’t have the luxury of throwing everything and the kitchen sink at the South Atlantic. Surprising amount held back and numerous contortions around war stocks.
539 2018-01-21 16:19:09 For the past few days, it was so good to see you just talk about Stocks, Economy, Development.. but not for long. Here you go again with your biased opinions. I don't understand why people have to tarnish others image to just glorify their own.

544 2018-01-21 16:17:51 Govt's shut down. We are the laughing stocks of the world. Our "leader" is an idiot, and we've gone back 100+years in progress for rights for our people. Welcome to the USA!
545 2018-01-21 16:15:22 Still a major issue because to open an bank account in a foreign land you need documents. Same for buying properties. The only way to hedge wealth is stocks or buying currencies.
546 2018-01-21 16:14:08 For THW past few says ..It was so good to see you just talk about Stocks, Economy, Development...but here you go again ..reminding everyone of your political bias
547 2018-01-21 16:13:55 What a lot of people fail to understand is that, for a significant portion of this market, you're actually buying company stocks disguised as coins/tokens. I mean... -_-
548 2018-01-21 16:13:49 @arrow_26gi お誕生日おめでとうございます！
549 2018-01-21 16:12:03 You really don't know how the stock market is played. The 1% are the ones who could afford the smartest people to manage their investment while the ones with 401ks stay all in on stocks when they go bad buying off the 1% making them even richer. It's game of musical chairs.
550 2018-01-21 16:11:45 value stocks, not growth. who knows, knows.
551 2018-01-21 16:11:14 Were you around during the dotcom bubble? Lots of stocks seemed like good gems and eventually never reached ATH again. They are still around but price was extremely overestimated back then. Cryptos are going thorough a similar road now, prices don't make any sense anymore.
552 2018-01-21 16:11:04 Yes.  IMO this outcome is what markets have been discounting since 3q16.  See what Fed did last time US debt/GDP was >100% & Federal spending was near 25% of GDP from 1942-51 - pinned 10y UST ylds at 2.5%; bonds got destroyed on real basis as stocks & CPI skyrocketed
553 2018-01-21 16:09:35 couple of stocks that have gone parabolic- $CAT $BA. they will be easy shorts when we get a little pause in this overheated mkts
554 2018-01-21 16:09:28 Where's a decentralized exchange for stocks?
555 2018-01-21 16:08:23 Unfortunately stock ownership in the USA down significantly since before the Great Recession.  Just over 50% I think. Its a tax cut for anyone who owns stocks
556 2018-01-21 16:07:56 Tryna understand stocks and bonds
557 2018-01-21 16:07:40 You sell snake oil and penny stocks.
558 2018-01-21 16:07:29 Main point is the argument that was made for having to buy stocks since 2009-that being low interest rates-is no longer the case as yields have been rising and in some cases by 2000-3000% from late 2014 in the case of US O/N LIBOR.
559 2018-01-21 16:06:32 For sure
560 2018-01-21 16:05:48 My rather simplistic take: #CryptoCurrency ATM is more like unregulated stocks that can be used for a lot of transactions. Some are like penny stocks, some are more blue chip like. The stock exchange is decentralised. Not sure if it’s going to work, but worth exploring.
561 2018-01-21 16:05:02 On that I wish Michael the best of luck. That is probably on my top 10 list of the hardest stocks to trade over the last 30 yrs. Probably just me.

564 2018-01-21 16:03:25 @realDonaldTrump Stock market is doing great, but approx. 50% of Americans are invested in stocks
565 2018-01-21 16:01:24 Certes, mais il il a des stocks de mines gigantesques. N'importe quel pays qui serait agressé et voudrait se défendre ira en acheter et les utilisera s'il juge que ça peut l'aider à ne pas être vaincu.
566 2018-01-21 16:01:18 What stocks should I buy ? What are the good ones ... anyone making any money out there ?
567 2018-01-21 16:01:06 The one thing I really like about dividend investing is that even if the stocks are dropping, I see the money coming in. #dividend #investing #wealth #stocks #money #finance
568 2018-01-21 16:00:49 Your tax "cuts" expire. Corporations will cash out all these stocks they're buying back. Layoffs increase daily.
569 2018-01-21 15:58:47 I think starc ashwin and stocks will be top 3
570 2018-01-21 15:58:37 A question to cannabis related investors big (not me) and small (me). What do you think will happen to all the OTC, Pink Sheet, Index stocks if the spending package stalled right now goes unsolved into Monday business hours?
571 2018-01-21 15:57:46 Hey Alexa, what stocks should I buy on the open tomorrow?
572 2018-01-21 15:56:56 And cash is so cheap, boosting stocks since there isn’t anywhere else that’ll give better than 1% apy

J'aimerais augmenter considérablement mon style avec le Unicorn Sweatshirt Jaune qui malheureusement est victime de son succès Hâte de voir le réapprovisionnement !
575 2018-01-21 15:53:50 Personally I find bumpfire stocks to be just plain silly. A guy with a good semi auto can do far more with less if he has skill. Other ROF increasing devices worries me though. Mainly because they are so vague.
576 2018-01-21 15:52:33 Paulatin nyo po ng kape. Kaylangan ko nv stocks :(((
577 2018-01-21 15:52:02 Better buy the stocks so you can receive all the dividends. They're coming.
578 2018-01-21 15:51:40 #valuations and #creditability is real. Valuations and creditability is not only with stocks and bonds but with people also. Ask the credit agencies... #credit
579 2018-01-21 15:51:08 FINANCE- science and art of MANAGING MONEY.

580 2018-01-21 15:50:44 did you know half of all Americans don't own stocks at all? Stock rally only helps the wealthy half of America.

585 2018-01-21 15:48:57 1) I hear a lot of people saying institutional money will soon make $BTC less volatile. Sure, but an influx of retail specs will make it even more volatile. Just think about the crazy moves we experienced in 99-00s Internet stocks. Every drawdown may become worse from here until
586 2018-01-21 15:48:50 Switching between film stocks and speeds compound the problem. I should know better.
587 2018-01-21 15:48:34 Very true...a very good thing!! But last qtr the FANG stocks were not near ath when they reported. AMZN was around 100 points from its ath. Was a much better set up.

590 2018-01-21 15:47:30 Quels stocks?
591 2018-01-21 15:47:13 No, it’s a real click. More money in pockets of Americans, repeal of healthcare mandate, ended TPP, appointed a Supreme Court judge, and brought stocks to record highs for most of the year...I’d say that’s pretty successful and exudes confidence.
592 2018-01-21 15:46:35 Snapshots can always be misconstrued, plus people’s position change all the time on stocks.

608 2018-01-21 15:37:03 Stocks to trade next week (Jan 22 to 26): Titan target 930; Tvs Motors target 760

611 2018-01-21 15:35:53 No President in history took credit for stock market performance. You do realize that stocks can become over valued and take a downward turn right? The wealthiest investors won't hurt, its peoples needed 401k's? Wonder if he would still be taking credit if the market slumped??
612 2018-01-21 15:34:58 I wouldn't boycott em...I don't have a membership anyway, but it's not gonna make me sale my stocks in them....bottom line that's a trash offer based when they pulling in a billion give or take a month in subs...that's a low ball offer

616 2018-01-21 15:28:12 Keith Speights from the Motley Tools writes "3 Fastest-Growing Diabetes Stocks of 2018 -- According to Wall Street" Then goes on to give them a back handed slap to the face especially MNKD once again. This low life hacks will get his sooner rather than later.
617 2018-01-21 15:27:40 Stocks did better in Obama’s first year than in Trump’s? Not nearly as good on S&P though!! And remember this O'bummer 1st year was in 2008!! The stock then was So Low, it had no other direction to go but up!! Under Trump, the market has hit the highest level EVER!!
618 2018-01-21 15:27:29 Buti kapa may stocks HAHAHAHA
619 2018-01-21 15:26:51 @AskeBay @eBay  your company used to be very efficient and fixes problems immediately.haven’t used it for 10 yrs. excited to use it, and just disappointed by how it evolved. Withdrawing my ebay stocks from my portfolio.
620 2018-01-21 15:25:22 @nswenson413 you have a friend in my blocks now
621 2018-01-21 15:23:32 2/
Quantitative investing based on computer formulas/trading by machines are leaving the traditional stock picker in the dust & dominating the equity markets fundamental discretionary traders" which now account for only about 10 percent of trading volume in stocks.
622 2018-01-21 15:23:06 If you can't  see the progress   Trump made this year for our great nation you are Blind and narrow minded. Democrats need to keep people poor and stupid to exist . Unemployment all time low stocks all time high
623 2018-01-21 15:21:12 There's no artificial blood being manufactured in UG or anywhere. So if no natural blood donations by Ugandans, expect low or no blood stocks.
624 2018-01-21 15:21:07 You might be a little too old to hear this but peoples retirements in 401k just went way up this year.  People own stocks, not just rich people. Jobs are coming back and you know if your truthfull your Medicaid and medicare won't be eliminated.  GBA
625 2018-01-21 15:20:22 Ok actually though

When are we going to ban Bayonetta? Literally takes stocks off of one hit at low % and kills all hype

I've defended her for too long but she's so toxic to this game
626 2018-01-21 15:20:19 Haha. He is disappointed I don’t drive one everyday or at all.

629 2018-01-21 15:19:07 And you did well with mining stocks last year you say ... 
630 2018-01-21 15:18:07 I'm still laughing about "blockchain stocks".   100 years ago these people would have went looking for a horse and buggy with a motor
631 2018-01-21 15:17:58 Absolutely. Sugar stocks seem to be on their downward journey. Sugar stocks seem to be making peaks every 10-11 years. The previous peak was in 2006. The upward trend reversal in sugar stocks could be in the next 6-7 years. 
Just my thoughts. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
632 2018-01-21 15:17:05 Shareholders of pharmaceutical stocks see the deaths of fellow Americans as collateral damage to maintaining their retirement funds. RIP Tom Petty, Prince, and many nonfamous Americans. @realDonaldTrump #WallStreet
633 2018-01-21 15:16:53 In the old days the Police would put the offenders in "stocks" in the center of town. That was just as wrong as this is.
634 2018-01-21 15:16:28 A low cost, diversified portfolio of individual stocks can be achieved for a one-time commission outlay of ~$200 at a discount brokerage. It doesn’t have recurring fees like an index fund. Ask your advisor if costs matter, then explain why stock analysis is then important.
635 2018-01-21 15:15:15 All trump supporters have the same talking point. 
Stocks are up, unemployment is down, America first,
Obama did this, Hillary did that, go drink the koolaid,he's cutting taxes (yeah right) Blah, blah, blah.
 Dude, you have nothing!!!! #ShitholePresident
636 2018-01-21 15:13:08 He will like pot stocks when they come down another 10 percent.
637 2018-01-21 15:12:14 Bengali,Ukraine one, cash to Iran, Clinton foundation. How's that for Democrate. Control. Wake Up stocks up, jobs up, employment up

641 2018-01-21 15:07:33 Write a regulation banning bump stocks!
642 2018-01-21 15:07:29 $SPY WTF is going on in this ? We have SO MUCH HATRED towards each other! We’re all HUMAN! Let’s just talk stocks, make  & move on. 
643 2018-01-21 15:06:20 Your ad says dems complicit in illegals committing murder due to lack of support for wall.  Does that make you complicit in lack of support against bump stocks? That makes your complicity bigger.
644 2018-01-21 15:06:13 Kuch ni sir just saw your profile..u comment every where to give some tip, hot stocks.....
645 2018-01-21 15:05:17 There is more to being president then just the economy.  And to answer your question my 401k and stocks are doing quite well just like they did during Obama’s term.
646 2018-01-21 15:04:55 These hillbilly f*cks are dumb enough to think that a stock market that is up bc 6 SEATS IN 45's CABINET IS HELD BY GOLDMAN SACHS EMPLOYEES, is positive for them. Even tho they're not invested in stocks. This is how dumb they are 
647 2018-01-21 15:04:47 You guys do it on background checks and bump stocks... so you should know the answer to that.
648 2018-01-21 15:04:25 Short all beer stocks this week. Sales down 35%. These ladies are occupied and not fetching brews for their lords.
649 2018-01-21 15:03:54 Love free time to work on my passion #stocks
650 2018-01-21 15:02:40 I feel sorry for you. Not knowing that those rollbacks are killing you with the environment, and not letting your children not get a decent education, as well polluting your water through fracking. Also you mean stocks, not the economy is booming, ie Wall St.
651 2018-01-21 15:02:35 Repubs are complicit with murders committed with bump stocks by that logic.  Vote in November.
652 2018-01-21 15:01:43 People buying stocks based on their momentum (prices shooting up irrespective of fundamentals) may want to study the last period in which this happened: the summer of 2008
653 2018-01-21 15:01:17 Tax it just like the IRS does with stocks, bonds, etc.  Every broker/exchange provides a 1099 with cost basis and sale price.  Easy.
654 2018-01-21 15:01:06 Often wonder how the hell the newscasters do it, imagine pretty tough waking up- must need heavy antidepressants (think trump & GOP hold stocks?) The stress must be unbelievable ... they must go homicidal if their spouse asks what's for dinner.  Neck killing me thinking about it.
655 2018-01-21 15:00:54 #Electric #Car #EV are #Wonderful But More Needs To Be Done With Work Commercial Vehicles #SchoolBuses #Trucks Etc That's where #Adomani Inc. #ADOM comes in with their #Impressive retro-fitted electric drivetrain after the holiday volitivity the stocks will surge

657 2018-01-21 14:59:37 Only 50% of Americans own stocks. Give me a REAL example of when trickle-down ever worked, not just an unproven theory....
658 2018-01-21 14:58:45 konti lang stocks :(
659 2018-01-21 14:58:06 stocks excangeでETHEREUM METAL というコインが1satoshiで売っていたため、名前に惹かれ1850万トークン買ってしまった..

660 2018-01-21 14:57:41 Yes. Got exact same questions last night - why haven't I sold, why haven't I diversified into stocks, aren't I afraid the system will crash...

:P
661 2018-01-21 14:57:03 Did my taxes online last week w/o a W2...not trippin' over it, as soon as I get that direct deposit it's going into Stocks & Cryptocurrency

This is why CNN is #FakeNews
663 2018-01-21 14:55:08 This policy makes no sense, at all, for resident foreigners who make Korea their home. I can trade stocks, bonds, buy real estate, start a business and even gamble at a casino, but suddenly I can't make krw deposits at a crypto exchange I've been using for 4 years?
664 2018-01-21 14:53:46 I just don't get it. Stocks at an all Time high, lowest unemployment , GDP up 3% first time in over 3yrs, tax laws changed so that typical fam of 4 making 70k will see a return of 2k, more than  5T added to the economy? Do dems just like being broke, miserable and jobless?
665 2018-01-21 14:53:25 In marketing scarcity is a mind mechanism used to persuade the consumers: by telling that a product is available in limited stocks or period, it will pressure them to purchase. #NMKTRCH @lets_NEUROmkt
666 2018-01-21 14:53:00 Question from WSJ: "Where would stocks be now if Hilary Clinton ere president?"

That's the wrong question. The right question is: Why do you think that you know the answer to your question?

The average yearly salary of the top 10% is $155k, the top 3% earn $320k!

767 2018-01-21 13:23:50 Once it becomes law, that’s it. Having bump stocks is not a right in the first place. Since it is not listed as a firearm, doesn’t that make it fair game to ban it?

771 2018-01-21 13:21:13 Fair enough.  So we agree to outlaw all bumps stocks to make the world safer. And of course we also agree to codify universal concealed carry to also make the world safer. of course with very stringent controls of who qualifies for concealed carry.
772 2018-01-21 13:20:44 You are so right. Trump likes to get credit for things he didn't do. I have lots of stocks and I've been earning dividends for years way before Trump.
773 2018-01-21 13:19:12 Because the top1% got a tax break. So the billionaires can reinvest in their already wealthy lives. Wall Street stocks does NOT affect my economy at all.

779 2018-01-21 13:11:08 It's a fact that index funds consistently outperform funds with a bunch of highly paid brokers doing nothing but TA all day.

There are studies that prove that an experience trader, a 9yo child and a monkey throwing darts to pick stocks will have a similar performance over time.

813 2018-01-21 12:25:53 They are totally right. It's not as if a stock is something made up, where you pay for a piece of paper with no true value. And nobody ever lost money with stocks. When did the economy recover from the 2008 crash again ? 2016? 2017? I've seen 20k become 2k and never going back.

912 2018-01-21 09:21:58 no.  that was a fair change.  They should bring back the stock meter instead of it having a number for stocks.  The version where they had the bars charging to show stocks like rachel wind made more sense and idk why they removed it
913 2018-01-21 09:21:09 i think he’s pretty well done in cf2. only thing i want back is chain cancel to not sap stocks. wishful thinking

930 2018-01-21 09:00:28 My argument is that 2 stock in that scenario more heavily punishes those mistakes

It stands to reason that the more stocks there are, the more that overall good play is rewarded - you deserve to get hit by Fair Spikes, I agree ...

935 2018-01-21 08:56:09 #ThisDay 2008 - Black Monday on the world's stock markets saw the FTSE 100 have its biggest ever one-day fall. European stocks closed with their worst result since 11th September 2001, and Asian stocks dropped as much as 14%.
936 2018-01-21 08:55:38 It’s part of a balanced portfolio. I got in $RISE at 22 cents so I don’t mind it now. 20% return is a lot, beats by far banks and even stocks. Even for crypto is a lot especially since it’s risk free.

948 2018-01-21 08:45:44 I think the one thing that really bothered big investors is the online traders. Buffet keeps the cost of one share over 150 thousand and never splits to keep them out of reach and as stocks rise less people can afford them only the wealthy become weathier.

1044 2018-01-21 06:31:20 The heart of Graham’s argument is that the intelligent investor must never forecast the future exclusively by extrapolating the past. #investing #Markets #Bloomberg #quotes #stocks #WallStreet. I really think people investing in todays market should be cognizent of this.

1046 2018-01-21 06:29:49 @Atulsingh_Asan hi Atul I like your confidence on your scripts and the way you encourage people to hold stocks in tough time great going... look forward to catch up with you one day
1047 2018-01-21 06:29:33 Apologies, I thought you were referring to where #StephenPaddock bought bump stocks, the original subject of the confiscation story.  He bought his guns legally in CA and NV.
1048 2018-01-21 06:27:11 More and more penny stocks that looks like they want to run is a sign of a maturing bull market. #JSE
1049 2018-01-21 06:25:00 This doesn't happen as much in blue chip stocks because it needs a FUCKTON of money to control the chart, but Crypto (because it's so new and we don't know how much people/groups own) trades and feels very similar to how OTC does.
1050 2018-01-21 06:23:24 Bump stocks don’t change anything about the weapon other than give someone who isn’t fortunate enough to own a class 3 firearm the simulated sound and sensation of automatic fire.
1051 2018-01-21 06:23:18 You’d think that I’d be out on a Saturday night when I finally have a Sunday morning off..but here I am in bed, buying stocks 
1052 2018-01-21 06:22:01 What is the ratio of investment in all these 11 stocks? Is it 1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1
1053 2018-01-21 06:21:23 Also, in your Yahoo News Column, you write, "The Trump tax cuts help explain why stocks jumped almost immediately after Trump’s election in November 2016"  Trump made tax cuts the day after he was elected? Huh? #FakeNews #YaWHO?

1055 2018-01-21 06:19:22 It’s not, actually. It probably will be. One day.  It these aren’t stocks. Banks and governments, until recently, haven’t been taking crypto currency seriously. So there are literally no regulations or laws to govern their trade. It’s why you would call a “Wild West” out there.

1059 2018-01-21 06:06:44 Part of why I missed out on the fun was my phobia for anything resemblance of  gambling.. I don't do stocks either. But I had the hardware to mine. I did then.. Could of mind me a fair amount when mining was profitable.. So now that's what am doing
1060 2018-01-21 06:05:38 Well considering the majority of Americans have no money in stocks, I imagine some of them.
1061 2018-01-21 06:02:01 Even stocks photos know you should have something on the desk.
1062 2018-01-21 06:00:23 One of the reason I don't buy infra stocks.When things turn bad in economy many will vanish.Punj Llyod was called mini L&T in last bull run and it vanished.Only LT has survived in 
depressed Condition.But can make good money in good economy cycle of 3-5 yrs
1063 2018-01-21 05:58:53 There is a lot of good stocks in 2018 I'm hoping to see more x5 x10 
1064 2018-01-21 05:58:36 I don't think it will go much lower this time. Most weak hands got shaken out. investors have nowhere to go since stocks and bonds are both overpriced. Crypto is too uncertain. The only possibility for it to go lower is a large rate increase and a substantial dollar rally.
1065 2018-01-21 05:57:40 I’m guessing they produced limited stocks to both :(

1069 2018-01-21 05:49:46 Yes , it is true that penny stocks outperform the blue chip stocks on a way up or down. 
The same goes for all these small markets.

1073 2018-01-21 05:46:06 How can you say that a one time bonus by a slivers of the companies that received this huge tax break is a good thing? Anyone who has any business sense knows that these companies will  buyback their stocks and continue to reap the benefits of low taxes forever...
1074 2018-01-21 05:45:53 why do you care what other people do?

Stop gambling on stocks and go clean your neighborhood.  or build the system that will.

1085 2018-01-21 05:36:34 The economy is not flourishing because of Trump. The stock market has been steadily increasing for years. Also, stocks are not the whole economy. The majority of Americans do not own stock and something like 80% of stocks are owned by the wealthiest 1%.

1093 2018-01-21 05:30:31 I agree that there is no good reason for fully automatic machine guns. It was BHO that permitted bump fire stocks.
1094 2018-01-21 05:30:28 You will be proud of me on this scene more than knowledge or stocks.

1096 2018-01-21 05:26:26 Pretty sure, based on Mass gun laws already, there are three AR15s in the state and none of the have bump stocks.

1113 2018-01-21 05:04:04 The move in the market is artificial. Low interest rates have caused a overvaluation of equities by over 3 Trillion $ stocks P/E running at 49% higher than the .com bubble with no fundamentals to support it... just wait for the bust it’s coming...
1114 2018-01-21 05:03:41 The stock market DEFINES THE ECONOMY stocks are going up because business have less bs regulations! Company’s are growing and moving back to the US creating THOUSANDS of new jobs for Americans.
1115 2018-01-21 04:59:30 The stock market is high because the rich are getting richer. The top 10% own 93% of all stocks. Some middle income will see temporary paper gains in their 401Ks, but job growth is slower under Trump & wages are stagnant. Trump ran as a populist & governs as a plutocrat. #Impeach

1136 2018-01-21 04:39:42 And now the rise in bumpstock stocks. Yea I know....not funny.
1137 2018-01-21 04:38:18 Criminals have AR style rifles. Now, only criminals will have bump stocks. I see no good reason to have bump stocks but, like  guns, you can’t un-invent them.

1140 2018-01-21 04:33:02 Wow penny stocks and now penny cryptos? Maybe bitcoin should be regulated more by SEC and others.
1141 2018-01-21 04:29:57 He certainly works hard at golf (at taxpayer expense).  

Plenty of businesses still closing, many layoffs.  50% of people don’t own stocks.  Corporations & very wealthy LOVE the tax changes that primarily put money in their pockets.  Universal benefits TBD.
1142 2018-01-21 04:29:48 Bump stocks don't turn semi autos into autos, which is why they have been legally sold in the US for years.

1147 2018-01-21 04:24:39 Good riddance to bump stocks. Hopefully, they will be banned nationwide. The 2nd Amendment does not cover them.

1157 2018-01-21 04:17:59 @realDonaldTrump Trump is being complicit in the murders of those innocent people in Las Vegas. Said "now" wasn't the time to talk about bump stocks, bowing to NRA pressure. Never went back to talk at all! @EdKrassen @RanttMedia @DNC

1160 2018-01-21 04:14:49 it's like mgnt needs to walk the talk.

1161 2018-01-21 04:13:33 Are u hinting at agro stocks..
1162 2018-01-21 04:13:21 Or what? They may want to strongly consider unconstitutional seizure, there are plenty of US to defend our 2nd amend constitution God Given right. I don’t personally own a bump stock, nor do I want or need one BUT if they start with b stocks, what’s next?
1163 2018-01-21 04:11:33 I overall liked it. The animation takes some adjusting to, but it ends up clicking well. I liked the new concept they did on Godzilla & the world & characters are well rounded and, to me, have areas of gray not just black or white stocks...

1167 2018-01-21 04:05:42 I agree 100%. I called my broker the other day and had to wait on hold for 45 minutes when in the past I could always get right through. Apparently its all these people flooding into the market to get into weed stocks

1172 2018-01-21 04:01:14 How much of this positive change in S&P values is the direct result of human decisions and how much is the result of computer algorithms that decide which stocks to buy and sell? How does a trading algorithm factor in @realDonaldTrump? There's a lot of #smoke in there.
1173 2018-01-21 04:00:19 The #TrumpShutdown has been manufactured by the #ShitHouseRat for his own personal gain. He knows on Monday Wall Street will take a dive. His Organization and all his Cronies will swoop in on cheap stocks and make a fortune when the government opens up again. #ATMWhiteHouse
1174 2018-01-21 04:00:07 So?  It's also the case that stocks have very little to do with Main Street.  And that the role of government is to fund broad public purpose when it spends & tax in order to regulate inflation & inequality by removing excess dollars from circulation

1178 2018-01-21 03:59:17 @debostic Thank you for following me, I am a fundamental income investor with stocks, but since cryptos don't pay dividends (that I know of), I like Ethereum because of the smart contract and Refereum because I read their reasoning and it makes sense, definitely want to learn

1217 2018-01-21 03:16:39 And Bitcoin wealth is toxic in a way that stocks and shares are not, too. It is similar to a dragon's hoard. Rather than being deployed to create new wealth through production of goods and services, it simply sits, unproductive, and derives faux value from its scarcity.

1242 2018-01-21 02:52:23 There was definitely a trump bump in stocks. That does nothing for the 50% of Americans that don’t have a 401k, wages are still low, he’s sabotaged health insurance markets, and I could go on and on!
1243 2018-01-21 02:52:08 At one point of my life, I’d blow through almost $3000 a month on things I didn’t really need, at all. The older I get, the more stupid I feel about those decisions. Nothing to show for a lot of it. Stocks, bitcoin, and degrees for some but could’ve had so much more

1246 2018-01-21 02:47:47 52% of Americans own stocks.  More own homes.
1247 2018-01-21 02:46:20 Good tips I've been burned before.  Fortunately I don't dump a bucket full of money into these over hyped penny stocks.  Usually u see a small increase in pps followed by dramatic losses.  Its best to sit on sidelines ,study and wait.  Don't be too eager to invest.

1253 2018-01-21 02:43:52 All of you bashing this Presidency but continue to see your pension plans and stocks going up need to stop complaining.  If you don't like it, run for office.  Better yet, be more productive and find a second job to keep busy instead of having time to cry over the Clinton loss.

1302 2018-01-21 01:53:11 Just hypothetical guess who wants to look into Stocks widget on macOS wether something coming in iOS when opening it as they never solved how Yahoo got compromised.
1303 2018-01-21 01:52:22 If so many Trump supporters are making so much $ on stocks, why don’t they get their teeth fixed?
1304 2018-01-21 01:52:04 I'm buying stocks!!!
1305 2018-01-21 01:49:12 Break out stocks Oriental Hotels gained 20% and reached 60 from 50 but Nitesh Estate down 25% percent after break out and reached 17 from 23. Let’s see what happens next. One flog one hit.
1306 2018-01-21 01:49:09 Twitter stocks are going down, and they're not going back up. More truth will be revealed about their agenda, and they will fail.
1307 2018-01-21 01:49:01 It's crypto currency developed and controlled by the elitist.  It has no value in the real world today, but it may change soon.  Due, to the globalist PUSHING to elimate cash from society.  The stocks are up and down so far. This started from the dark web. Research before you buy
1308 2018-01-21 01:48:02 Hes fixed the mess your party made,jjobs,stocks,economy.

1310 2018-01-21 01:46:16 good god 

well, forget about Las Vegas, TX, and Charlottesville...I suppose.  Bump stocks still legal, are they?
1311 2018-01-21 01:45:24 I love what you're doing with our country! Unemployment is down got more jobs Chrysler is coming back to Detroit and the stocks is up! Damn fine job Mr. President
1312 2018-01-21 01:45:04 WSJ: where would stocks be if HRC were president? REALLY? Where will stocks be w a nuclear war? Where would democracy be w HRC? THRIVING
1313 2018-01-21 01:44:24 I agree. It sure appears that way when you read all the anti Trumper's hate. Don't you just hate seeing your 401K and stocks growing. yeah right every one hates that. #ReleaseTheMemos
1314 2018-01-21 01:41:28 Yahoo finance did detailed analysis. Stocks had crashed 46% bytime obama took office.Had little more 2fall. Fed,quantitative easing ramped up economy. So, of course % would be skewed. Had Hillary won, stocks would have increased modestly. Trump sent them soaring. Report honestly!
1315 2018-01-21 01:40:02 Just like MJ stocks traded at many multiples before revenue. I think the idea sold here was the potential of zeu and rumours. Terms thrown around like end of all blockchains propelled the valuation.

1317 2018-01-21 01:36:27 If you have google home or listen to pod casts make sure you listen to npr and business insider to know when to sell. Some are expecting another recession within the next 12 months. Happy about your stocks rn. And I hope your government job stays safe. No sarcasm being serious.

1323 2018-01-21 01:26:56 When he returns to NYC he should be put in stocks in Times square and pelted with rotten tomatoes, old Big Macs, Buckets of KFC, and chocolate cake.

1328 2018-01-21 01:20:43 stocks would be good. he'd live
1329 2018-01-21 01:20:35 *praying to Lord na hindi na ako maubusan ng stocks. Lagi nalang kasi eh. 
1330 2018-01-21 01:19:38 Do not forget where we were in 2008. Yes, now it will be good too for....shareholders esp since companies are buying their own stocks back. I'd be optimistic too if I was getting millions or billions in tax cuts. That doesn't reflect the rest of America.

1345 2018-01-21 01:11:23 "Where would stocks be right now if Hillary Clinton were president?"

With any hope, on the National Mall, with Trump and all his co-conspirators locked securely within.

watch other stream instead
they play an entire 3-game set
go back to other stream
peach dittos in game 2 both players at 3 stocks
1348 2018-01-21 01:08:25 @WSJ @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @FoxNews - more fake news from WSJ! Their story “Where Would Stocks Be Now if Hillary Clinton Were President?” is their continued attempt to De-legitimize the Trump’s Presidency. If Hillary were president my retirement would be trashed!
1349 2018-01-21 01:08:23 If they wanted they could probably do that to almost any stocks. Canadian stock exchange is more vulnerable as it is less regulated
1350 2018-01-21 01:08:10 Good question but I think $GLD would breakout anyway. Precious metals seem undervalued a lot vs stocks
1351 2018-01-21 01:07:51 He's been right so far that stocks will keep going higher and not be afraid of an imminent recession. Nice work Hugh.
1352 2018-01-21 01:07:36 What about AAPL and NVDA? (Or are they not "internet" stocks?)
1353 2018-01-21 01:06:01 Yea Manny told me Neha took 10 stocks  damn let's go kelli! They were sleeping on AZ!!!
1354 2018-01-21 01:05:45 I'm not a holder but I've seen bigger ramps on other stocks that never got mod'd.
If posts good or bad make an investor go and research harder then they have both served a purpose .

Sometimes by being in a position of power you can serve your own interests.
1355 2018-01-21 01:05:37 Unang araw pa lang tangina uubusin na agad stocks.

1360 2018-01-21 01:00:57 Yes yes, clearly its got7 causing JYP stocks to increase. They debuted 4 years ago I wonder why stocks never skyrocketed during those times? JYP increase in stock parallels Twice explosion in popularity but its clear got7 is the reason investors are buying JYP stocks now. rofl.

1371 2018-01-21 00:55:12 Bruh that Tweet was at the very beginning of the season. Regretting it now.
1372 2018-01-21 00:55:02 @realDonaldTrump please do not allow the new proposed changes the ATF is considering regarding bumpfire stocks. It is way too restrictive. We elected you to protect our rights.Don't forget us.

1376 2018-01-21 00:51:59 Sorry I don’t read the news on a lot of the stocks that I trade I’m only buying it off of the chart setup...
1377 2018-01-21 00:51:39 Tonight just hit me I won't be getting a pay check this week. I have to depend on my own work ethic to receive one and deserve it. I had a good paying job but decided it wasn't enough. Step out of your comfort zone or you'll never be the person you want to be. #Stocks
1378 2018-01-21 00:50:40 Penny stocks are a better comparison imo.
1379 2018-01-21 00:50:27 Going to focus on making some smoke stocks for myself and maybe putting some up on Sellfy as well
1380 2018-01-21 00:48:09 @J gonna see this and be like wtf bro
1381 2018-01-21 00:47:59 Made 34K profit on my stocks this year... laughing to the bank.
1382 2018-01-21 00:46:56 Been addicted to stocks since 09.... damn lol
1383 2018-01-21 00:46:01 Yes I do know.... the lowest black unemployment under President Trump since we started tracking it. Highest stocks in history also. Should I go on? Pretty long list actually, and just think we get 7 more years

1385 2018-01-21 00:44:42 Soaring #stocks ? Thanks to what legislation exactly ? When did it start soaring ? Faster now, slower ? Stock high in #USD , but what is the US #Dollar worth ? It’s tanking on all markets (Down 15%+ of since 1/2017) Don’t US companies need foreign goods ? What about citizens ?

1389 2018-01-21 00:42:52 Wise words -- people seem to want to buy everything on sale except for #crypto and #stocks
1390 2018-01-21 00:42:07 Which women Jessica? Those who made $$ on stocks, those who found work, or those who were handed nice bonuses at year's end? 

Or are you referring to the screaming ladies in pussy hats in the street who embarrassed themsekves?
1391 2018-01-21 00:41:36 Top 20% own 92% of stocks, with a super-concentration in the 1%.
The military is SO strong you want a huge increase because ...?
ISIS - we have to stay in Syria "indefinitely" (yay, dead poor people's children in the army!).
Borders - give us a break.
#FuckOff #FakePresident
1392 2018-01-21 00:41:14 yes, they do, but why do they short these types of stocks? I agree with the reasoning. Promo & hype rise the SP, shorts bring it down when it reaches a boiling point.
1393 2018-01-21 00:40:34 If my paycheck stopped for a few weeks from the #TrumpShutdown, I would just live off these piles of stocks I'm swimming in here in my living room.

1396 2018-01-21 00:39:02 I'm thinking you might regret that  when it's in the dollars, which I assume won't be that long from now. Don't forget what they're building... I've sold too many weed stocks for a gain like you just pointed out, that are multibaggers now. Just saying
1397 2018-01-21 00:38:41 Obama is responsible for the stocks. Crime has increased with your white domestic terrorists. ISIS is not as much of a threat as your white domestic terrorist supporters. Tax cuts are a scam. The biggest accomplishment you have is the first Pres to willing serve Russia
1398 2018-01-21 00:37:56 Absolutely
1399 2018-01-21 00:36:26 How to start to trade with stocks !??
1400 2018-01-21 00:32:58 Many people have IRAs, 401K’s pensions invested in stocks/mutual funds. Try retiring on social security alone.
1401 2018-01-21 00:31:40 Hopefully this idiot dumped his stocks and bought Bitcoin!  What else would explain for these posts from these soy boys?
1402 2018-01-21 00:31:21 My 2018 resolution is to Master Hotkeys  while day trading stocks. I’m watching @TSXtrad3r tutorials on Hotkeys, and wow ! Cannot wait until my fingers run like Usain Bolt on these momentum stocks 
1403 2018-01-21 00:31:14 Record high stocks, huge victories against ISIS, best border security in decades, I'm afraid you'll have to keep it shut down another 7 years at this rate!
1404 2018-01-21 00:30:26 
1405 2018-01-21 00:30:12 Most people don't invest in stocks; Trump presided over the least amt of jobs added in 8 yrs; Your tax relief will run out; millions have lost healthcare. And you were saying?
1406 2018-01-21 00:30:09 [We've sold winning stocks with strong competitive positions too soon & we've held losing stocks with weak positions too long] - Chris Welch
1407 2018-01-21 00:29:45 I don't think that's correct. You walk into any sporting goods store in Dallas and Texas stuff is all over the place. Each company stocks individual outlets based on demos and buying preferences.
1408 2018-01-21 00:29:32 Part 32 How to payoff the national debt. Social Security, not Congress should decide how trust fund money is invested. Congress may veto, say try again. Social Security may want to invest in stocks, mutual funds, index funds, local & state government bonds, infrastructure bonds.
1409 2018-01-21 00:29:03 Why would he do that?
Why should he flush hes entire career down the toilet?
People who claim he is liquidating is like claiming that Steve Jobs sold all hes stocks before launching iPhone
Its just such a stupid theory it makes my head physically hurt.
1410 2018-01-21 00:28:14 Hahahaha.   I have non-techie friends telling me they're betting on pot stocks and crypto stocks.   It's 2018 dude.   Why u still betting on stocks like a dinosaur?
1411 2018-01-21 00:27:29 Me? Yeah, I'm great! Girl's day out with my besties at the salon. My stylist stocks wine. 
1412 2018-01-21 00:26:09 Damn wish I seen sooner. Just sent mine off to stocks
1413 2018-01-21 00:22:10 I’m disappointed nothing was done about bump stocks, get over it. #trumpshutdown
1414 2018-01-21 00:19:45 We women did come out in the masses to vote for a #POTUS who is actually making a difference. Look at ISIS, stocks, unemployment, regulations, jobs!! #WeThePeople elected #Trump and we will #MAGA
1415 2018-01-21 00:19:39 The Boeing thing is interesting. One stock out of the 65 in the index accounts for 28% of the 5+% move so far this year...but by lifting the DJ so much causes more optimistic buying of other stocks. double-thrust! Everything is messily correlated.
1416 2018-01-21 00:18:21 What about all the wait people my people who commit murder every day and the white man who mowed down almost 600 people mr. President? Have bump stocks been eliminated in America? Oh what about the white people who murder Mexicans African-Americans Asians mr. President? No reply?
1417 2018-01-21 00:18:15 All stocks.
1418 2018-01-21 00:17:44 Again. HE didn’t do that. He doesn’t just sit there on Wall Street and think, “oh, I’m feeling generous today,” lumber over to a machine with DOW/NASDAQ/etc that have up and down buttons like elevators that can be pushed to adjust the stocks and push all the up buttons. lol
1419 2018-01-21 00:17:17 controversial tweet: hate or like the president, we all still alive, nothing bad has happened, and stocks are up 30% in a year. maybe you should all work smarter instead of not at all because you at a ralley complaining
1420 2018-01-21 00:16:59 Was thinking of buying more stocks with that advise will cool it!
1421 2018-01-21 00:13:11 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to improve your EDS
1422 2018-01-21 00:12:25 Peruvian penny stocks!  No risk there!
1423 2018-01-21 00:12:15 Buy the time $SQM supplies the market the #Lithium demand will be 5 times stronger than today, best lose the media hype and get on board the #Lithium gravy train, quality stocks will shine through.. buy the dips ..
1424 2018-01-21 00:07:34 30% out there have been shorting stocks for the last year losing their asses?  Not sure how there could be anything more than 10% or so... best retail holiday season ever including brick & mortar, stock market gains are huge, confidence high, tax breaks coming... hmmm
1425 2018-01-21 00:07:16 This is a really polite way of asking people which of their stocks have performed best

I thought everything was fine and BANG I lost 100k in an hour when I got back by car...
1428 2018-01-21 00:05:42 Hunting Horn mains should be locked up in stocks in the middle of the Gathering Hall and laughed at by everyone that walks by.

1431 2018-01-21 00:04:12 Hey sometimes it just hits me that I can legally buy stocks. Got no idea how (yet) but I kinda wanna buy stocks
1432 2018-01-21 00:03:39 From what I could see most of the options were weeklys? What was your thought process behind choosing weeklys on those specific stocks out of the entire stock universe?
1433 2018-01-21 00:02:09 Agreed!, @ParaSan12 perfect buyin opportunity exists atm for quality #Lithium stocks going forward..

He’s unfit,we are laughing stocks to the world b/c of his ignorance
1436 2018-01-21 00:01:07 So...like stocks?

1442 2018-01-20 23:53:52 Honestly I sold all my stocks, I needed to take a step back. I know it can happen to any company, but there are some who are less targeted than others and it is in those that I will start over again 
1443 2018-01-20 23:52:31 What's your gut feel? Any evidence of “the smarter players” quietly pulling out of over-extended stocks, or out of market altogether?
1444 2018-01-20 23:51:57 It’s already begun all indicators are showing it the market is massively overinflated and stocks are so overpriced housing slowed again for 3rd straight quarter & the deregulated wall street so they can do like they did pre bail out so many ordinary people will suffer
1445 2018-01-20 23:51:06 considering 50% of Americans own stocks through some method I would assume there doing good as well.

1450 2018-01-20 23:45:47 I know ppl that own 1 or 2 stocks, idk ANYONEA that trades. Very big difference.

1479 2018-01-20 23:39:36 All I know is that the stocks I own and my 401K has skyrocketed  thank you Mr. President!!!
1480 2018-01-20 23:38:54 Wall Street Remains Red Hot
 The U.S. stock market has  come out of the gates  smoking in 2018 after a stellar 2017. For the  third week in a row, U.S.  stocks were higher. In just seven  trading days, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  blasted from 25,000 to 26,000.
1481 2018-01-20 23:37:57 UninhibitedThoughts asked what happened to the bump stock ban. The NRA asked the BATF to look at imposing tighter regulations on bump stocks. The BATF is considering reclassifying them as machineguns, which would ban them under the 1986 machinegun ban.

1483 2018-01-20 23:36:01 More then 1300 over the past 6 months and another round coming up for Humana!! Yet stocks did well, corporate tax cuts, shareholders doing very well but not so much for Humana employees. Oh bought 40% of Kindred also.
1484 2018-01-20 23:35:46 Going to upload a vid today in the morning or in the afternoon tomorrow;)
1485 2018-01-20 23:35:41 How’s your 401k?
Your stocks?
Mine are doing great. Hell I didn’t even like Trump at first. Then I stopped watching the news and watched the world around me. It’s a beautiful thing.
1486 2018-01-20 23:35:36 Definitely agree there. Btc is not the only bubble. Add stocks, bonds, national debt, housing, fine art and many others to the list. You could look at it in another way, theyre not bubbles, but rather dollar is truly depreciating against these assets
1487 2018-01-20 23:35:02 I agree.  I suck at buying calls.   I would rather sell covered calls on high premium stocks and if I loose the stock I just buy back on pullback.
1488 2018-01-20 23:33:05 Stocks went up with Bush tax cuts then in 2008 the rich got out of the market to avoid consequences of greed leaving us with the debt.
1489 2018-01-20 23:32:53 looks like a big fat ugly bubble in stocks ....as #Trump said it was
1490 2018-01-20 23:32:46 Most of the good news is due to the Obama era. The lower taxes and less regulation has added to economic progress. Lower taxes will cause a lot of inflation, which will cause economic stress. The poor (who don't own any stocks) will feel very little impact from the good economy.
1491 2018-01-20 23:32:23 Ah you could make these sweets as stocks right? Or spare it with your members unnie >v< anyway unnie could you teach me Rough dance? I had mission before in The Unit and I sang your part in Rough ㅇvㅇ

1494 2018-01-20 23:31:31 I trade cryptos (only been a day, lol) the same way I trade stocks and it seems to work pretty well so far. There's no jerking around when the market is closed because the crypto market is always on. You're just always trading. Throw a swing on while you're sleeping - whatever.
1495 2018-01-20 23:31:19 I am sorry but you are wrong. I am a senior ~ my stocks have increased six fold, my taxes are lower ~ and I am excited about the next 7 years. Corporations are expanding~jobs are back~employment is lower than the last 40 years. Wake up and enjoy the benefits.

1497 2018-01-20 23:30:41 Do u know what percentage of Trump's base actually owns stocks?  I'm guessing 5% at best?  Most have low education, and many are collecting welfare waiting for their promised mining jobs to return.
1498 2018-01-20 23:30:40 Grouse moor estates take advantage of the few species which can tolerate their barren heather habitat without compromising grouse stocks and laud them as conservation achievements. This is a cynical distraction from reality and the public should not be fooled.
1499 2018-01-20 23:28:44 It's era of artificial intelligence to trade stocks.
The person will continue to increase the money without having to work even one second.
1500 2018-01-20 23:28:44 Their vision is shortsighted, stocks are going to be worth a lot more in a year unless they know something I don’t.
1501 2018-01-20 23:28:35 No question it’s a hedge, who said put everything there?  I just think if you think your safe in stocks and bonds you’re a fool
1502 2018-01-20 23:26:25 Yea I don’t agree. Crypto iscloser to stocks than real estate. 

Also highly doubt they consider Btc to bch different than Btc to eth.  It’s still a different crypto
1503 2018-01-20 23:26:21 Most of the good news is due to the Obama era. The lower taxes and less regulation has added to economic progress.

1505 2018-01-20 23:21:17 FBI investigating a person of interest & opened up Grand Jury on Vegas Shooting...meantime nothing done to stop Bump Stocks
1506 2018-01-20 23:19:37 I don't count the number of bases a stock has already formed. The really big winners do not roll over after two bases #empirical #stocks
1507 2018-01-20 23:18:56 $200 trillion in #stocks #cash #bonds #gold around the world ... all 4 overvalued. If 2% of that ends up in #crypto you have a $4 trillion total market cap; 7X where we are today. If $BTC #bitcoin holds its current market share ... that would put the price at $80,000
1508 2018-01-20 23:18:49 One of the best biotech stocks
1509 2018-01-20 23:17:06 And the bump stocks played an insignificant role in that event as bump firing is a technique that does not require a special stock.
1510 2018-01-20 23:16:44 Government shutdown aside, our economy is booming under Trump; like it or not, it’s facts. Jobs, stocks, tax brakes, and stuff like that... it’s good. Love me or hate me, I’m pretty. So.... whatevzzz...
1511 2018-01-20 23:15:24 I’ve found it has a lot with understanding the ballistics, but I’m talking to an actual Rocket Scientist so I’ll quit while I’m ahead. I’ve do have some talking points we will share in person. Got your SlideFire stocks yet? We all better, and quick.
1512 2018-01-20 23:15:16 1% of the American people own 83% of the stocks. Where are the tax returns You promised to show us?
1513 2018-01-20 23:15:12 I just need to invest in chapstick stocks. As much as i lose them and go and buy another, if i didnt id have an extra $100 a month.
1514 2018-01-20 23:14:14 @realDonaldTrump on this one year anniversary can it really be touted that we are better off? Stocks are up, but my banks offer very little to those saving for the future weddings, college, family events. GDP IS little better than FLAT.
1515 2018-01-20 23:14:10 There are currently many growth titles with inviting chart patterns. Among other filters, one filter I am using is to favor those that at least doubled in price in 2017. Up 2x is better. These have proven they have what it takes #stocks
1516 2018-01-20 23:13:51 Jess, this year women have seen the lowest unemployment in their demographic. More women serving in leadership in the WH than any other time in our history. Women working have seen their stocks go up and taxes will go down. What could you possibly have to complain about??
1517 2018-01-20 23:13:40 What does his taxes have to do with making America great again? Why don't you want to see Hillaryass taxes on the Clinton foundation.? 501 3c omg! Rachael maddow(madcow) already made a fool of herself on his taxes.. laughing stocks all of you clowns!
1518 2018-01-20 23:12:42 We judge our nation on stocks? thats all you got...... Are you sure you graduated???? DO WE HAVE PROOF? I WANT PROOF!. 80% of the stocks are owned by 20% of the people , who just got BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAX BREAKS?.  Your a specail kind of stupid @POTUS #TrumpShutDown
1519 2018-01-20 23:12:11 systemic conspiracy. connecting dots doesn't always reveal the big picture I hope you are able to sell your stocks at the right time what a pleasure it is to have a coloring book these days
1520 2018-01-20 23:11:10 A growth stock is a recession-resistant company growing earnings at least twice the S&P's long-term rate of 8%. #mydefinition #stocks

1524 2018-01-20 23:07:40 @realDonaldTrump Again..Mr Narcissistic the economy has been growing for years after all recession..that didn't ALL happen because of U What goes up cycles down. When stocks fall..who u going 2 blame? Obama? Dems? Hillary? Muslims? Cause while u take credit now credit now....
1525 2018-01-20 23:07:06 Cleveland Cavaliers along with LeBron James are laughing stocks of the NBA...that win streak meant nothing because y’all played no one...Arthur memes, all smiles while winning...cries for help and trades and fire Lue while y’all losing.

1529 2018-01-20 23:05:22 I will answer basic questions, but I am not providing trading advice on specific crypto, options or stocks.
1530 2018-01-20 23:02:38 The article is factually sound, the conclusion is not, title is click bait. People buy antiques, gold, bonds and even stocks hoping to sell at a higher price. I am not sure why CC is foolish!
1531 2018-01-20 23:01:44 Wonder if security fraud investigators are keeping an eye on the Trump family's stock portfolio for early selling of stocks in anticipation of a government shutdown 
1532 2018-01-20 23:00:44 @bbolan1 Brian, do you think stocks get hit on Monday morning with the government being shut down now?

1534 2018-01-20 23:00:06 Interested to also see performance of vanadium stocks next week. $IRC is the one to watch imo. amazing value imo at these levels with potential to be largest vanadium resource in AU over $KRC.
1535 2018-01-20 22:59:58 Hear me: In the beginning, playing stocks with high spreads will kill your account! You do not have the experience to manage those trades. Look for high float stocks who moves slower, So you have time to react. You can still make tons of money safely
1536 2018-01-20 22:59:27 agreed, can't keep holding onto fragments of the past, Everton. C'mon lads, we can pull through and do this. And while you're at it; please consider buying The Simpsons Seasons 1 - 15 box set! Available now with free Prime delivery for only £34.99!!! While stocks last :)
1537 2018-01-20 22:58:57 Very excited for next week. Shorter trading week due to Australia Day. Will we still see fear in market for lithium stocks or will fundamentals kick in and stocks rally back ? enjoy the weekend.. reload and relax ... tomorrow is a new day.
1538 2018-01-20 22:58:36 Bananas is being super downsmash happy these last few stocks at low percents in dangerous situations instead of weak hit combos or follow ups... hmm... it was a close set but I feel like he definitely could've had it if he wasn't so agro on the stray strong hit effort.

1540 2018-01-20 22:57:14 Anyone invest in stocks? Tips/tricks? What do you use? How do you get started?
1541 2018-01-20 22:56:22 Me referencia de mlogic o algo así en cuanto al texto y de sntly en algunos stocks, pero dudo encontrar alguno igual
1542 2018-01-20 22:55:33 Again, stock market only helps rich & corporations. Average american doesn't have stocks because they live paycheck to paycheck.
1543 2018-01-20 22:54:45 Does that make the @GOP @realDonaldTrump "complicit" of all mass murders using AR15s and bump stocks?
1544 2018-01-20 22:54:29 We accept the challenge.  Can you handle our stocks? :)
1545 2018-01-20 22:53:20 any sign of updates from them and this can go flying...just need them to give us something
1546 2018-01-20 22:52:37 On that note I'm going to be taking a more cautious approach when entering stocks from here on #undervalued #hiddengems
1547 2018-01-20 22:52:21 Shares?  What did you buy?  You buying crypto stocks/ETFs versus actual cryptos?  I’ve done both
1548 2018-01-20 22:50:31 The illegal immigrants may not shoot ‘Murikans. Only ‘Murikans with bumper stocks and an arsenal of weapons can do that to concert goers. Duh.
1549 2018-01-20 22:47:59 Not gonna lie the market has me a little spooked the way stocks have been trading over the last while and especially after reading chat boards seeing all the new investors not knowing simple fundamentals before they should even own stocks #unpredictable
1550 2018-01-20 22:47:39 Been off twitter for an hour or so; any update on bump stocks?
1551 2018-01-20 22:47:18 Really depends on the tech! I love ethereum and that blockchain in general but if sticking towards the same platform as bitcoin then litecoin is a great option. NEBL is showing promise as well as OMG. But unlike stocks, the crypto space is still so new with the technology.
1552 2018-01-20 22:44:01 32 quarters of a terrible economy...that is a train wreck Nancy!  Unemployment down across the board, stocks up, confidence up...that is a train headed in the right direction.
1553 2018-01-20 22:42:52 Good piece!  Tears Schumer is a disaster! New York is sinking in its own political
swamp. SAD. Did you here pension systems are being ordered to sell its energy stocks for public employees. Can you believe it. Ridiculous. Meaning public policy! Not CA yet but we are notfar behind
1554 2018-01-20 22:42:17 and maybe 30 stocks in google
1555 2018-01-20 22:41:58 It is disgusting. If they want to use that logic then they should examine how the GOP have allowed mass murders to happen in this country because they refuse to ban bump stocks, or have more extensive background checks. They want to keep people out who will harm the American
1556 2018-01-20 22:38:03 Unprecedented?  Facts show it was a continuation of the trend Obama started, in fact jobs and stocks grew slower under you this year than last year.

1562 2018-01-20 22:34:51 The Trump presidency is the quintessential baby boomer presidency. Spending fully 1/4 of the time golfing, destroying the future of the planet/economy to inflate his stocks for the next quarter, literally failing to even run a government at all, and then blaming everyone else.

1565 2018-01-20 22:31:08 Friend: I’m trading bitcoin

Friend: no, I don’t like investing into technology stocks

This is everything that is wrong bitcoin
1566 2018-01-20 22:29:32 This is my new Twitter for trading Forex, Stocks, and Binary Options.
1567 2018-01-20 22:29:30 Let's talk bump stocks, @GOP
1568 2018-01-20 22:27:55 None of the AR-10s had bump-stocks but all had bipods. If they were used automatically they must either have been illegal or had Gatling adaptors. I believe little of the official story.
1569 2018-01-20 22:25:55 And Mercer hates Trump now, too. Bet his stocks are way up tho!
1570 2018-01-20 22:25:09 Invest half real estate. half of the remainder in a business. And the remaining in stocks.
1571 2018-01-20 22:23:32 @SunriseTrader is there an ETF or stocks you like for earning season in particular?
1572 2018-01-20 22:19:36 @iancassel Whats the best research source for tech Stocks, in your opinion? I’d like to read some good research material about It. Mainly social networks, Netflix, Amazon, tesla (tech?)

1576 2018-01-20 22:14:10 As usual all the LOSERS are back on the street crying in spite of the first year successful Leadership of the POTUS. Economic prosperity is back, low unemployment, 401K stocks are up, Taxes are low, and jobs are coming back.
1577 2018-01-20 22:13:40 Ya my stocks, paycheck and 401k are really suffering. Get of the POTUS thing and start taking advantage of the opportunities he has provided
1578 2018-01-20 22:13:24 My robot friend Sergei (who is totally not a Russian bot) says to consider buying Sarepta Therapeutics $SRPT #Stocks
1579 2018-01-20 22:13:19 1) Compare unemployment to 2016 not 2010. 2) Many American families have very little invested in stocks and 401K plans. 3) The women marching care about so much more than money.

1581 2018-01-20 22:12:19 So I can take two stocks off Armada and Hbox but I cant take a single one from a random Ganon.
Cool.
1582 2018-01-20 22:04:46 Be ready to see more & more long balls come from the blade of @AmySatterthwait in the very near future-relentless in her approach to improvement will see her power hitting stocks rise & make her an even bigger threat! #mindset #driven #powergame #watchthisspace #GetOnRed 
1583 2018-01-20 22:04:12 Ratios you should look at before investing in stocks via @BT_India Ratios you should look at before investing in stocks
Looking at the ratios you can not only analyse the company's historic performance but also make a comparison with the company's peers.

1587 2018-01-20 21:59:59 Cryptos on the move. May be a decent bounce in their related stocks on TSX TSXV CSE come Monday.
1588 2018-01-20 21:56:57 Wow yet less Americans have a 401k than a year ago or maybe how about the fact that majority of Americans dont have stocks #foxnewsspin #FakeNews #foxnews #TrumpShutdown

1594 2018-01-20 21:50:16 Low price, high future return. Stocks that will let you sleep well cause you know they are bargain at this price 
1595 2018-01-20 21:50:00 surely thinning out stocks will help. I also keep some during the season below the bloom to help with plant structure & stability
1596 2018-01-20 21:49:57 It will be interesting to see what will happen over the next week or 3 with the shutdown of the Trump goverment.  gold will rise. stocks will fall what will crypto do?

1610 2018-01-20 21:42:51 Never buy stocks on margin
1611 2018-01-20 21:39:57 Good find with warrants @ .60
1612 2018-01-20 21:39:47 What probably happens is we get a giant bust, then they come out with massive stimulus which triggers an inflationary cycle. Stocks recover some in that cycle but don't get back anywhere near current levels in real terms. Like 1966-96--30 years of zero real returns.

1615 2018-01-20 21:36:52 True Martis.

But at the same time any Tom, Dick or Harry can also lose money in this market too. Plenty of newbies selling 50% losses to chase stocks that have already multi-bagged, only to to give themselves more losses. I think a bullish market is a dangerous place to begin.
1616 2018-01-20 21:36:07 @realDonaldTrump better do something quick!! If shut down long, stocks will crumble and he will lose his bragging rights.
1617 2018-01-20 21:35:28 Micro caps, small caps, and mid-size caps are an under appreciated investment vehicle on Wall Street. Even the penny stocks have good returns often. Their just very volatile
1618 2018-01-20 21:34:32 Which would be beneficial if the majority of Americans actually owned stocks.
1619 2018-01-20 21:32:41 this dude thinks stocks and bonds aren't materialistic and never seen a white boy who can dump shells all day long
1620 2018-01-20 21:31:35 Explain to me if the stock market is so great why my Goldman Sach's stocks are losing money every month!  Never believe the architects of the Great Recession.

1623 2018-01-20 21:30:02 I wonder if that’s how it’s always been for stocks as well
1624 2018-01-20 21:29:44 So he trolls his dissenters? A lot better than locking them up or executing them. No law against trolling people who make themselves into laughing stocks.
1625 2018-01-20 21:29:38 republicans control all three branches of gov't, any inaction is theirs. They wouldn't even ban bump stocks
1626 2018-01-20 21:28:42 I’ve been playing stocks for a long time, I will never forget the tech wreck with the catch cry of “the new economy” and it’s different this time, but it all went to shit.
1627 2018-01-20 21:28:16 stocks and bonds are materialistic because it's an investment that at some point in the future will yield returns, those returns are then used to buy materialistic shit, it's not that difficult to understand
1628 2018-01-20 21:27:51 Buy Nintendo stocks already
1629 2018-01-20 21:27:41 My dad: the only stocks I’ve been watch are Bitcoin and weed.

Me: Are you a fucking millennial?
1630 2018-01-20 21:26:19 look dumbass, u said "fuck materialistic shit" then u proceeded to talk about stocks and bonds as if they not materialistic. U don't know what you're talking about.

1634 2018-01-20 21:24:45 Trump has ridden on the rise in stocks from work done prior to his step into the economy in his position. The numbers for the March haven’t even fully come in, but are at this point counting higher than last year. Get your facts.

1641 2018-01-20 21:21:55 That's referring specifically to the rebound the day after the election (when stocks crashed because investors were scared of a Trump presidency).

1649 2018-01-20 21:16:15 Time to invest in some stocks 
1650 2018-01-20 21:15:28 Indeed they are. 12-6. Or until stocks last.
1651 2018-01-20 21:15:27 2008 Take-aways: When the rush to liquidity comes (and it will inevitably come), people sell whatever they own that's liquid. In other words, they sell their highest quality stocks first, which is the opposite of how they should react.

1656 2018-01-20 21:13:20 c'est un non événement ... le changement vient de la baisse des stocks des Bons du Trésors USA détenus par la Chine. Un autre système de paiement hors dollar est en train de se réaliser ! Attention aux turbulences
1657 2018-01-20 21:12:56 The House should have open floor debating instead of hatching corporate giveaways and rich people tax cuts and Wall Street tax cuts and de regulation of pollution in our lakes and streams. Don’t you know Rep Davismost people aren’t millionaires, and don’t own stocks.
1658 2018-01-20 21:12:00 Let’s see, YOUR stocks are up 50% , you’re a CPA from a shithole in NoCal, which means you have more money than most average Americans. Of COURSE you support Trump and bacon!
He’ll kiss your ass & you get healthcare.

1665 2018-01-20 21:06:54 Automation of jobs and outsourcing results in less people working and more people earning less for the work they do.  The economy is NOT good. Not for the bottom 50 percentile of workers. Most of us dont own stocks & if so not many.
Housing costs rise eating up our income.

1687 2018-01-20 20:53:46 Losing money under Obama can be influenced by so many things (mix of assets, returns on specific assets/stocks, timing of investments discipline to sell) that your statement is meaningless. Unless you have realized gains on that 5k gains are only in paper.

1689 2018-01-20 20:53:19 @PARISDENNARD we are not complaining about the economy because it’s the same as @POTUS44 left it. Majority of us don’t own stocks.
1690 2018-01-20 20:52:45 Let's put it another way. The prices of stocks are artificially manipulated to ensure investors don't lose. If it hadn't of been for mass qe they would have crashed in 2008 & never recovered. The standard person has been the main victim of this process & paid in welfare cuts.

They are Marching in Protest Of Your Destroying everything accomplished trying to Turn Back Time remember Woman outnumber Men 5-1 and minorities outnumber All. People are angry you should aknowledge that.
1697 2018-01-20 20:44:09 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
1698 2018-01-20 20:43:58 Hey look at all the rich people getting richer from stocks? How many of you broke-ass Fox viewers are getting rich off your investments this year...?
1699 2018-01-20 20:43:57 @porinju people want pataka stocks, no one listened or I'm sure bought gvk at 9.6 or 9.7 the Stock did not hit upper circuit the very next day, plus there is so much moat , 2 years back every tv show was about future group. In short keeps eyes and ears open
1700 2018-01-20 20:41:16 Between those dates, Trump put the USA on fast track!
In just one year the economy skyrocketed, employment at high levels, black unemployment at lowest in history, Big bonuses being given to employees, stocks at record high, consumer confidence record high, and @SenSchumer cried.
1701 2018-01-20 20:41:09 Oh and please let’s not forget all of their investments in stocks! You can tell that they’re super happy that their stocks have risen tremendously!
1702 2018-01-20 20:40:43 What % of Americans own stocks? Few middle and no low income. Lots of happy wealthy people tho.  BTW why do you think you have the right to speak for women regarding our reproductive process. Get back to government issues.

1705 2018-01-20 20:39:57 I will not be surprised if the market gaps to new all time highs. Naturally it can be a rush from public assets(bonds) into private sector(stocks) but who really knows what can happen in this new paradigm
1706 2018-01-20 20:39:47 The #SchumerShutdown will hopefully let the liberal stocks crash!
1707 2018-01-20 20:39:38 Congressmen who introduce frivolous articles of impeachment are laughing stocks.
1708 2018-01-20 20:38:44 Bad for the economy? Have you been hiding under a rock lady? The economy is doing great! Have you heard the news? The economy is up stocks are up unemployment is down...wow and you are in some kind of power? Massachusetts better get you out of office you my dear lady are cluless!
1709 2018-01-20 20:38:34 "Take your word for it." This is called due diligence. Don't take anyone's word for anything. If you can't research stocks you probably shouldn't be stock picking. I am seeing a lot of uniformed commentary on SX and this why people sell out of fear.
1710 2018-01-20 20:38:15 Over all else. The health of the business and well-being of the workers doesn't mater when the business is a slave to the investor and they investor only cares about stocks going up now and fast, so they can make quick profit, sell and move on
1711 2018-01-20 20:37:17 Stupidest comment you’ve made lately, you have to actually own stocks to have gains, dumb@ss
1712 2018-01-20 20:35:24 As for bump stocks, they were originally designed to help disabled gun owners with firing their guns.
1713 2018-01-20 20:33:36 @realDonaldTrump, stop ATF from reinterpreting Regulations on bump stocks
1714 2018-01-20 20:33:25 NEWS: Nigerian stocks most profitable in the world.
1715 2018-01-20 20:33:01 Listen and listen closely.  Risk averse in my 401K means a Money Market which means stocks need to be SOLD to be moved into it, capiche?  Good.  So WHEN can I move my $?  At the END of the day Monday with whatever the markets close at.  THAT is how they have us by the gonads.
1716 2018-01-20 20:30:51 Instead of being out here investing in turning up, flexing for social media & get rich quick schemes; invest in your future , IRA accounts , 529 college saving plans , stocks , etc. .. how bout daaaaaaat
1717 2018-01-20 20:30:29 I listened to their pleas for innocence workers, families, and military would be hurting, last night.Please the same GOP tax cuts pass last month will do more damage to middle .Major Corporations will put the monies into their stocks. GOPcare less about middle/lower .
1718 2018-01-20 20:30:05 Following this criteria I am looking at Silver and Gold stocks....
1719 2018-01-20 20:30:03 Here's my latest crazy idea: means-tested congressional salaries. You have $5 billion in  stocks? You make $4 million a year from your business? No way you need to make more than minimum wage to (fail to) govern.
1720 2018-01-20 20:28:51 Dont worry the time for new stocks just begins!
1721 2018-01-20 20:28:36 I see that my stocks are up over 50%, employees are receiving nice bonuses and the markets and economy are screaming ahead while wage gains are growing. My blinders are off and I see democrats that hate everything except promoting illegals over citizens.

1727 2018-01-20 20:21:00 Economy up, Regulations way down. 2.5 million new jobs added. Unemployment down to 4.0%. Biz, stocks, manufacturing way up- record levels! America safer; we have great respect around the world. Making friends and allies, exposing enemies. Most of all people and God first in USA!
1728 2018-01-20 20:18:58 If this is the final stage of the bull market you could have a melt up in stocks like we are potentially seeing. Do we ignore this analysis if this is the case?

1730 2018-01-20 20:16:57 I understand. $200 trillion in #stocks #cash #bonds #gold around the world ... all 4 overvalued. If 2% of that ends up in #crypto you have a $4 trillion total market cap; 7X where we are today.

1732 2018-01-20 20:16:51 @DanielKrawisz Hi Daniel. I read your article "Appcoins Are Snake Oil." You explain why you think altcoins aren't stocks, but you never explain how a stock market could function in a crypto economy. Do you have any thoughts about it? Or have any resources to suggest?
1733 2018-01-20 20:13:57 I don't have any stocks so I didn't make anything. But I'm okay with that because at least I'm not a halfwit chud.

1746 2018-01-20 20:06:33 One year ago today, my entire platform for the next president of the United States arrived in the Oval Office. Since the Trump election, the net asset appreciation of US stocks = $6.9 TRILLION or $21,200 per person, including illegals.

1751 2018-01-20 20:04:06 Use that tax refund to invest in some stocks, bonds, mutual funds. Pay down some debt and build your credit. Start that business that you keep thinking about. Do something productive with that money.

1759 2018-01-20 19:58:55 @CiocanaTrader how do you know at around opening time that a stock will go down or up. Is it based on volume and interest? I find that if there is one main stock in play like FORD then people forget about other stocks and those tend to fade or go up a bit then fade down
1760 2018-01-20 19:58:15 @DavidDobrik your stocks are looking good today 
1761 2018-01-20 19:58:01 P.S......86% of all stocks are owned by 1% of the population so most of us don’t give a rats ass about the stock market. What I want to know is #WhereIsMyRaise you promised over and over again?
1762 2018-01-20 19:58:00 Is it to study on stocks you are wanting to buy? Looking at their graphs etc?

1774 2018-01-20 19:48:53 Damn right no consideration for others the selfish inbred Neanderthals! Community service is to easy put them in stocks for a week in a public place and throw used nappies at them & when they are released they have to pick it all up!
1775 2018-01-20 19:48:05 Larry is flat wrong; his job, the boards are to represent owners interest.

1776 2018-01-20 19:46:27 Ok. So @CliffordAsness point is lower capital gains on direct holdings of stocks is unchanged by tax law. But under new tax law, when stock used as comp, lower capital gains rate only applies if stock held for 3 Years, not 1?
1777 2018-01-20 19:45:16 @SenSchumer unemployment down, stocks up, immigration down, more jobs, stronger military,  better trade deals, less welfare going out, lower taxes, lowest African American unemployment in 45 years, Isis is done, American companies coming back and pissing off liberals Incompetence

1796 2018-01-20 19:34:29 He would not understand it's not about him and that they are not in the 1% that is making out from the stock market. We have 15 dollars more on check double insurance costs and the 15 folk are only last for a year then we lay more then before while 1% still gets to play stocks
1797 2018-01-20 19:33:35 Unless you’re at the verge of retirement, you know these bull runs don’t continue forever, right?  I’ll weigh in on Trump’s economy in 2045 if he hasn’t killed us.  For now I have no interest in watching my stocks bump and down because I’m not a kitten watching ping pong.

1800 2018-01-20 19:31:40 "Stocks"  
1801 2018-01-20 19:31:09 Yoh I'm not sure. I think until stocks last.
1802 2018-01-20 19:31:03 Obama used Government to protect the People from Soulless Mega-corporations. Trump is gutting and crippling Government so that the Soulless Megacorporations can exploit the People completely unimpeded. The rise in stocks means nothing to blue collar workers like me.
1803 2018-01-20 19:30:56 Yup and no one rich (at least if they want to stay that way) holds significant balances or assets in banks without a heavyweight central bank or state guarantee behind it. Better to hold stocks or bonds in USD, EUR or CHF, or these days buy real estate in a ‘safe’ country.
1804 2018-01-20 19:30:53 My 4th. Made sure I 'reduced' stocks beforehand! That sounds a bit too tempting.
1805 2018-01-20 19:30:17 I really hope dat all of @rapplerdotcom's foreign & local investors PULL OUT THEIR STOCKS na. Pronto! Maria, ru REALLY concerned abt democracy? Do u REALLY care about d Philippines? Perhaps u only care abt Rappler's money? Money = power. Power = influence. What ru really up to?!
1806 2018-01-20 19:30:09 The day he was elected,  stocks started soaring because everyone trusted him as a businessman.  Too bad half the country can't see that.  Didn't the Dow go up to 25,000? I could never imagine this growth,  thanks Mr.  President!  @realDonaldTrump
1807 2018-01-20 19:27:07 Went long pussy hat and poster board stocks that day. Biggest no brainer trade of the decade.
1808 2018-01-20 19:25:44 If I could follow up just a little, they say that b/c these coins are being treated like equity in companies when they aren’t. So it would be resetting all valuations like the Internet boom’s fall and how those stocks lost all their value and some like CISCO r not back to peak..?
1809 2018-01-20 19:23:15 Economic success and wealth creation is stagnant for 80% of the US population. Tax reform largely benefits the top 10%.  Much of this wealth creation is in stocks - which we all know can fall just as easily as they have risen. Let see real job creation with infrastructure bill.
1810 2018-01-20 19:23:11 Save your money and invest in stocks.  Much better ROI.

1813 2018-01-20 19:20:11 I can flip $5,000 into $5,000,000 by stocks and my music career.
1814 2018-01-20 19:20:10 What's this regarding, fyi...no one gives out their sources, but again,I do best to post stocks that either hav no more debt or the debt(dilution) is done.
1815 2018-01-20 19:19:02 If you want to reinforce your statement about being safe with investing in crypto, maybe give an indication what % of your investments in crypto vs traditional assets/stocks.  For example, I only have 5% of my net worth in crypto speculation.
1816 2018-01-20 19:14:14 No Brasil algumas defensivas tem sofrido muito, ok..growth stocks devem ir bem na recuperaçao mas juro em brl baixo deve favorecer elas tb.
1817 2018-01-20 19:13:27 Vynos z jistiny je vynos nejhorsi ztratove akcie, ale s max. ztratou 10% - na konci se vse secte. Abys dostal 19,2% na kuponech musi u vsech 4 pozorovani vsech 5 akcii byt pokazde v plusu - ale, nejlepsi legrace na zaver, kdyz USD ztrati vuci CZK 20% tak budes stejne v minusu :)

1820 2018-01-20 19:11:34 Yeah I know, blah blah blah, stock price is only thing that matters. I've heard that before. I avoid getting my face "ripped off" by not buying or shorting stocks I write about. If my tweets grieve you, then I am happy. I know they make Cohodes unhappy--he has told me. So sad.

1829 2018-01-20 19:06:14 Nice sentiment but as they secretly enjoy their wealth in their 401K or stocks or a pay raise or a new job they will still disrespect your work in making that possible #ReleaseTheMemo
1830 2018-01-20 19:05:45 Schiller called housing collapse several times and several years before he called it. And he has a some indices that tract market data for housing and stocks. So he’s Jamie Dimon with a bow tie. He’s Warren bufffet without the $$. He’s Peter schiff without the charisma.
1831 2018-01-20 19:05:30 2./Stocks are all priced > $100 forcing retail into the options market, when was the last stock split ?  dealing from a position of strength, have M & A, repatriation in your back pocket...the 1%'s can't be beat, unless of course a form of BITCOIN exposes the corruption or @CGasp
1832 2018-01-20 19:05:26 That's why I'm liquidating most of my assets so I'm prepared for this wave you all are celebrating comes crashing down and stocks, property values etc crash because of all the deregulating...of course big Corp. love the tax cuts and less regulations.

1835 2018-01-20 19:03:34 Me, when my adderall kicks in: wow I think the best use of my time today is to refold every article of clothing I own, then organize my closet by style and color, then learn more about individual stocks.
1836 2018-01-20 19:01:35 Omg! Will stocks go down?
1837 2018-01-20 19:00:02 Bull markets make you complacent and comfortable. Bear markets teach you. #stocks
1838 2018-01-20 18:59:36 I’m not arguing that he appears to be corrupt but the land deal is a matter for the FBI and the stocks are a matter for the SEC.  Both of which occured when Bush was president so bringing up issues when Obama was president is irrelevant.

1844 2018-01-20 18:56:16 I’m not a newbie who is enamoured by how well the markets are doing. I’ve seen the 2008 crash btw. I’ve seen stock markets promises crash. Be it real estate, banking or IT (company that promised a lot but messed up due to promoter). Seen it and leant a lot. #stocks

1846 2018-01-20 18:54:20 @tiptree _ Hi, is there a problem with your (my favourite) brown sauce? I've recently found it difficult to find a shop that stocks it. I've just bought 2 bottles from a big Sainsbury, although they are different shades of brown.
1847 2018-01-20 18:52:27 If he comes back free of prison shackles, he will be treated like the nobility after the French Revolution. I say put him in stocks in Times Square and let his adoring public decide.

1852 2018-01-20 18:47:32 Is the govt shutdown our first canary in the coal mine to know if BTC is inversely correlates with the happenings of stock market worries? (We will see Monday if stocks have a tough week and BTC doesn’t per govt shutdown). Flight to quality.

1854 2018-01-20 18:44:15 Stock markets will always be about price and psychology. Probably more the latter. How bullish/bearish are is an individual perspective. #stocks

1857 2018-01-20 18:41:40 Economy warning: stocks valued at 33Trillion in a 19Trillion economy. Exuberance. If profits do not meet expectations It could crash. If dollar strengthens thus killing exports or trade wars slow profits it could come crashing down. Invest in healthcare...aging population :-)

1859 2018-01-20 18:40:30 Ummmm the direct correlation between him being in office and my stocks rising 25%. The stock market has consistently closed at its highest marks since he’s been in office.
1860 2018-01-20 18:39:24 They are shamed- first, they were sure Hillary won election. 2nd they didn’t think the stocks would do great. Lastly, the positive outcome with tax cuts. They look like idiots and world agrees!!
1861 2018-01-20 18:37:37 @smerconish YOU have the balls to PRETEND on TV about Trumps low ratings?EVERY network,every newspaper,EVERY reporter,bashes and hates Trump!All we see is Russia,Dossier,and hes a racist!NO STOCKS!NO JOBS!NO ECONOMY!THATS why his rating are low.All we see is negative!PHONY!!
1862 2018-01-20 18:37:01 This isn't penny stocks man, its crypto! 20% swings don't mean shit!
1863 2018-01-20 18:36:44 I believe it's  not abt biasness it's abt the increasing euphoria. Same like women's magazine talking abt stocks Pick.. Why because they know their target audience interest has shifted
1864 2018-01-20 18:35:14 Basically, these is a smart ass way of joining the Army & IRGC into 1 financial structure, that is not sanctioned. What these agencies could not purchase, now a regular Joe trading stocks in Paris or US can!!!
1865 2018-01-20 18:35:03 Earth Energy: Colors: Yellow, Blue.  You may see these numbers today: 222 (Keep visualizing); 994 (No need to close doors behind you; jump through a new open door).  Stocks to Watch: TSCO
1866 2018-01-20 18:34:04 Afraid you’re right. Years of printing money out of thin air and overvalued stocks comes with a price.
1867 2018-01-20 18:33:20 *Yawn* 

Predictable speech:
*Highest Tax Cuts EVER!
*Stocks have never been higher!
*Most laws ever passed EVER!
*Most productive President EVER!
*Biggest Electoral College win in history.
*It was actually Hillary that colluded with the Russians
*I am MAGA!

1869 2018-01-20 18:32:46 People will think it’s easy to make money in a bull market. You’re right! It is. Buy a dip, buy a break out, buy a momentum trade, you will make cash. But does that mean consistency? #stocks

1875 2018-01-20 18:29:00 The stat does sound bad. I looked at several of the links, half of them indicated police responded to gun complaint, another said police ambushed.

1878 2018-01-20 18:28:20 Observation : Unlike stocks, a sharp drop in the price of a crypto doesn't create a self-fueling cascade.   When a stock drops, the company can't get credit as easily.  Cryptos don't take loans.
1879 2018-01-20 18:28:11 Good point. And just as often the courses are about buying and selling stocks. As if that is the problem that need solving.

1883 2018-01-20 18:27:02 Hey are bump stocks still legal? What exactly have you been doing this last year?
1884 2018-01-20 18:25:07 Just like stocks and how much a company can be valued at compared to earnings per share. That ratio can be quite high
1885 2018-01-20 18:23:53 Btw, if you blindly follow a tweet reco and go into loss, don’t blame the guy who tweeted because he/she’s expressing a view. If you trade on a view of x, be prepared to lose. Do your own research as well. #stocks investing

1887 2018-01-20 18:22:43 Just because you personally can't redeem them on a particular exchange doesn't mean they aren't redeemable. If I buy shares of spy I can't personally convert them to the 500 stocks underlying it, but they are redeemable (by APs) and that's why the prices follow the index.
1888 2018-01-20 18:21:30 Definitely considering buying stocks ... I dreamt of wall street.

1897 2018-01-20 18:15:03 Today my friend asked me why do trade/invest in the markets. Nothing is permanent in it. Profits. Loss. I said why don’t you believe in #NarendraModi. I’m not a bhakt. I’m a human that believes that growth is only possible with him. #stocks

1906 2018-01-20 18:08:41 mmm... Cash. Just cash. (Very) Expensive stocks, rising rates, widening deficit. Nothing warrants a crash, but slow-and-steady pull back looks unavoidable.
1907 2018-01-20 18:07:12 Euphoric moves happen when every believes that they can’t be touched, burnt, or lose money. Money can be lost badly if you’re over leveraged, borrowed money you can’t pay. A lot didn’t see 2008-09 sadly. Learning curve of a lifetime. #stocks #learnings
1908 2018-01-20 18:06:18 You said you also have some stocks, which ones 
1909 2018-01-20 18:05:33 This is going down next week. Be careful all. Stockmarket has become casino. These kind of stocks is loosing hands at this point in cycle.
1910 2018-01-20 18:05:10 I think both of their DBPM is a little fake too. Because they get more stocks than others on team they get credit for the good defense that Gray, Odiase, Stevenson play. All 3 are great great defenders but not amazing at stocks.

1912 2018-01-20 18:04:05 Which means that neoclassical ideas about money (ncluding Divisia) are still not tied to stocks of debt and flows of credit. That's one of the criticisms of Post Keynesians who are, inlike DSGE, fully consistent with the statistics on this.

1916 2018-01-20 18:01:33 Bro, part of making deals is allowing yourself to be "bought" for a price you want or higher.

1918 2018-01-20 18:00:46 Sarah, how many people in this country haven’t got $ in the stock market vs. how many do? It is great news for those of us with stocks/ retirement plans, but for the vast majority of Americans, this is irrelevant. I sincerely wish all Americans were as wealthy as you.

1922 2018-01-20 17:58:57 Yes. Stocks are extremely over- valued again, just like in 2007.  If the market doesn't crash this year, it will happen early in 2019.  Hang on, it's going to be a bumpy ride!

1925 2018-01-20 17:57:10 Christine did a great job with the colors. All we do, and we do this for every book on newsprint, is adjust in prepress to make sure the black prints deep and the colors print about 30% lighter than on glossy stocks so colors don't muddy up.

1933 2018-01-20 17:51:24 Agree but maybe there is a different paradigm as nothing is like it used to be. Ie. no supply of new stock and tons of buybacks skewing the normal supply demand balance for stocks. Super low inflation from technology making ave PE higher. Many things happening here.

1938 2018-01-20 17:47:10 Of course, considering spending on capital stock is a component of GDP, this correlation isn't very surprising. Nevertheless, although there's usually a lag, increasing capital stocks per worker can often enhance employee productivity.

1941 2018-01-20 17:44:17 “Finally getting s... done...” ??????In order to just get to this point they had to get a lot of “s... done” just so you know. I see posts like this and I just cringe at the lack of research people do in the stocks they own. :((((
1942 2018-01-20 17:43:59 Well everyone was looking for a melt up in stocks a couple months ago and they got it. Crowd pleasing is the new normal apparently.
1943 2018-01-20 17:43:21 Very strange that people keep 2008 crash in mind and stay fearful of getting invested, 

Remember Maruti was around 500 at 2008 peak and see it now. There are many such examples, 

we need to be in stocks where businesses are not going to die down.

1944 2018-01-20 17:43:15 It's a 120 back. It has a darkslide. It takes me forever to get through a roll of 12 frames. If I like it, I can buy a second and switch between 2 film stocks.
1945 2018-01-20 17:42:44 @SenSchumer Keep negotiating in good faith. As soon as stocks start to plummet you can be sure #45 will be willing to negotiate. Thank you for your hard work and dedication!

1950 2018-01-20 17:38:37 Printing 20 trillion of paper money and expecting people to not run away from it is also foolish.  Into crypto currencies or silver and gold and stocks of mining companies.
1951 2018-01-20 17:36:24 aye - on holiday at the moment so haven’t got my usual stocks! Really like it.

1960 2018-01-20 17:30:17 @StormFrontWX all this is happening because the Democratic Party seems to sill not accept the fact that @realDonaldTrump is the president and not #Killary Hillary. If Trump and GOP bad then why did stocks go up and why is economy better? #MAGA #Trump #MarchforLife
1961 2018-01-20 17:29:22 It's showing the total # of stocks listed on S&P 500 trading above their respective 200 day moving average.  It's a breadth chart.
1962 2018-01-20 17:29:14 Depends on the track. There's 4 different classes of sprints, 3 classes of micros, we have midgets, speedstrs, super sportsman, legends, 2 or 3 lm's, a bunch of different divisions of stocks, and a couple of classes of mods
1963 2018-01-20 17:29:05 You're mcm stocks in bitecoin because he lives on twitter and has no knowledge of what that stock is for.

1970 2018-01-20 17:23:50 Yet people are still in poverty. Maybe the DOW is great for dick measuring of wealthy but it means jackshit for the majority of Americans who are too destitute to have stocks.
1971 2018-01-20 17:23:22 With #bitcoin #eth and other #cryptocurrencies popping today, #btc plays will be in full effect on Monday if this price action keeps up.  Stocks to watch : $OSTK $GBTC $XNET $RIOT $DPW $MARA $KODK $NETE $WATT $LFIN $CNET $CCIH $INPX $NXTD
1972 2018-01-20 17:23:20 Yep. Just own stocks + treasuries instead if you like the exposure in most instances (exceptions include complete breakdowns like the GFC)
1973 2018-01-20 17:22:22 Hi, average Joe here..... other than pot stocks all I really do is read up on ETFs and bet on a few of the big boys like amazon....
1974 2018-01-20 17:21:40 Ils vont me faire pleurer avec leurs ruptures de stocks partout.

1977 2018-01-20 17:19:31 @DonaldJTrumpJr Stocks did better in Obama’s first year than in Trump’s  and he also wet up this years gains......
1978 2018-01-20 17:19:26 But the stocks are up and debt is lowering thanks to eliminations of restrictions. Atleast that's what they said on NBC.
1979 2018-01-20 17:19:07 What an eventful day ! More stocks added for tomorrow ! The BIG Tent Sale at the Factory Outlet just got better !!
1980 2018-01-20 17:18:56 Stocks did better in Obama’s first year than in Trump’s
1981 2018-01-20 17:18:48 Stocks did better in Obama’s first year than in Trump’s
1982 2018-01-20 17:18:41 Probably a bit early and not even certain that utilities wil recover, but some stocks seem to have found a bottom or a slightly reversing. AWK, PPL, NRG, SRE, AEP. No position.
1983 2018-01-20 17:18:40 @realDonaldTrump Stocks did better in Obama’s first year than in Trump’s  AND GAINS THIS YEAR WERE SET UP BY HIS POLICYS
1984 2018-01-20 17:16:00 That's exactly what I said SM is massive and trolling is the norm against anyone named. It is public stocks back from medieval times now
1985 2018-01-20 17:15:38 No. unless it were of her in some stocks and we could throw rotting veg at it.
1986 2018-01-20 17:14:21 So funny. Just the opposite. Most of them are centralized scams. Yeah, my investment strategy is to buy more penny stocks.......
1987 2018-01-20 17:14:15 Oh I'm 100% certain crypto is here to say.

Shitcoins refers to a speculative group of coins like penny stocks....

But Bitcoin is king and will rule for many years - will take something revolutionary to replace
1988 2018-01-20 17:13:54 How about you NOT let the ATF take away our rights unconstitutionally when it comes to bump stocks and binary triggers. I’ve commented to the ATF but what is that gonna do... c’mon. You’re DT! If anyone can fight for our freedoms it’s you!
1989 2018-01-20 17:13:48 I understand where yas are coming from. I doesn’t need it at all. Is a nice read but either way it’s gonna be just fine imo.
1990 2018-01-20 17:12:47 Girl, you need to detox.  Stock market is not an indicator of general well-being.  Only the well-being of the top 10% who can afford to own stocks.
1991 2018-01-20 17:11:45 They don't look to the future. What's making their stocks go up and helping their religious causes is all they care about. They're not humanitarians...not by a LONGSHOT!
1992 2018-01-20 17:11:27 Great looking forward to it
1993 2018-01-20 17:11:09 So Republicans run the House, Senate, & White House, but they blame the Democrats? It’s never been about our military or border security, it’s about making sure 401k and stocks go up. Its all about making more money.
1994 2018-01-20 17:11:00 stocks -- you'd accumulate $12,869 in 10 years and $121,744 after 30 years. 

However, if your employer provides a 50 percent match, as many do, your account would grow to nearly $183,000 in 30 years.

1997 2018-01-20 17:07:14 People are okay to earn 3-4% return per annum thru rental income but will not invest in stocks.

Infact if they need just 10% of the rented asset for personal use, they still cant liquidate partial & have to go for debt.

What's the use of such expensive assets.... #BigPicture

2006 2018-01-20 17:01:01 I would not either. We need to watch the stocks & Financials of these companies & other companies that increases sales to compensate for less prescriptions. Drs prescribing patterns by state too. Increase & decrease drug use too. That should keep us busy 4 the next 10-15 years.

2015 2018-01-20 16:54:43 If I were you, I'd withdraw my funds and put them somewhere the market can't hurt them.  The stock market is being kept artificially high by companies buying their own stocks and that can't be maintained for long.

2019 2018-01-20 16:52:54 You have a strategy that has an edge. You know if you don100 trades a year you will get 50 pct right on avg. Each win is say 2x+ of each loss.
Now i have 100rs and i buy at 4pct each 25 stocks . Then i know over a few turns of this pf i am likely to be sitting on profits.
2020 2018-01-20 16:52:52 You are right to some degree . With no information available it's hard to guess though . I've bought many cheap speculation stocks in past and made a killing . Problem with ISM . 20 is not that cheap compared to some ,I've bought. If it pulls back then might be worth the gamble
2021 2018-01-20 16:52:05 My point in order:

1) fixed income ETFs are usually worse ways to gain exposure vs MFs
2) high yield is overrated as you usually should just own stocks / bonds
3) in a taxable account, just own munis

Wasn’t trying to be overly complex here

2031 2018-01-20 16:45:10 How the market will react with govt shutdown ? Specially dollars and other stocks any idea ?
2032 2018-01-20 16:44:54 It's been generally accepted for a long time this is doable. Not sure we needed the proof of concept work. I suppose one positive thing that could come out of it is pressure to destroy the existing smallpox stocks, since as I've said for years, you can always make more.

2036 2018-01-20 16:41:31 I agree with you Nick. Even in the “regulated” stock market people ‘Pump and Dump’ the lesser known stocks, but I don’t know that these cryptocurrencies would even pass as a monetary instrument today. We’ll have to wait and see.
2037 2018-01-20 16:41:05 Buy stocks. Cryptocurrency is currency.
2038 2018-01-20 16:41:03 Tasty walks often end up at Stocks ... or the Island Hall!  
2039 2018-01-20 16:40:52 Cryptos are not Stocks.
2040 2018-01-20 16:40:51 Hmmm-just musing that w/ SEC shutdown (no sheriff in town), it's a good time to pump/dump penny stocks. In reality SEC has be out of biz for the past yr. Nevertheless, I won't do this kind of chicanery (I need to look in the mirror), but others will. 
2041 2018-01-20 16:40:36 MARKET ALERT: Stocks close higher despite threat of government shutdown
2042 2018-01-20 16:39:11 $XVG

Being a community coin and not a company coin means it’s truly decentralized.  Which is the heart of #crypto.

In my mind, company operates coins act as stocks, de-centralized coins behave more like currency = which is real the future.

2046 2018-01-20 16:36:00 Today marks one full year of the Trump Administration.

He has failed as a leader of liberty and equality

2061 2018-01-20 16:24:28 @Neha_trade hello madam many stocks which are doing well and listed on NSE as well but not available for but on ICICI direct or HDFCSEC is there any reason in specific . For example shrenik limited .
2062 2018-01-20 16:24:08 The year is 2018. I officially own stocks and crypto investments. Will also be re-opening my mutual fund and opening a high yield savings account.

2063 2018-01-20 16:23:49 I need to learn about stocks so I can start investing my money 
2064 2018-01-20 16:23:36 Your advise to invest in the same proportion of stocks and bonds as you have now, takes into consideration the likelihood of a bond crash?
2065 2018-01-20 16:23:36 If you think our country is in a good place, you clearly aren't paying attention and don't have a clue as to what our standing on the world stage is and what that effects. Your stocks aren't an indication of our country doing well.
2066 2018-01-20 16:23:09 Chennai also want Ben stocks or starc
2067 2018-01-20 16:21:34 We want starc or stocks
2068 2018-01-20 16:20:52 S/D is the starting point. Stocks have utility via the benefit of owning it. So, it's driven by S&D because, regardless of the reasons why, if buyers want to buy is > than sellers desire to sell, the price goes up. So, S&D is first order observation, the reasons why is secondary.
2069 2018-01-20 16:20:37 Honestly; doubtful. Our A.I. focuses on price action of single stocks in US markets
2070 2018-01-20 16:19:45 Are they also receiving Hilton Grand Vacation stocks and leadership positions on the board?
2071 2018-01-20 16:19:43 The markets are at all times high because big companies are buying the stocks back from their workers and because Obama’s bail out
2072 2018-01-20 16:17:28 Dow is only 30 stocks. Amid the crash of housing/Lehman Brothers in 2008, DJIA was below 8,000. Economic factors are bigger than one person in an office that was here before them and will be here after them.
2073 2018-01-20 16:16:24 I think what he’s trying to explain, is that Bitcoin is literally exchanging currencies like dls to , and Ethereum is like investing (like stocks) in a safe-money-transactions company (?)
2074 2018-01-20 16:15:11 hello sir many stocks which are doing well and listed on NSE as well but not available for but on ICICI direct or HDFCSEC is there any reason in specific . For example shrenik limited .
2075 2018-01-20 16:14:24 Pour le moment tout est vendu sur la prochaine et dernière commande. Il me restera surement quelques masques et corps, mais j'aurais épuisé mes stocks de boites numérotées hier soir. J'aurais "peut être" quelques pièce sans numéros dans les mois à venir  maybe

2077 2018-01-20 16:13:10 Oh and @Franklin_Graham, I bet most of your followers don’t own any stocks so you citing the stock market (the 1 that’s been soaring since Obama’s presidency) is laughable #Iseeyoureceivedyourtalkingpoints
2078 2018-01-20 16:11:19 Buy paddy stocks...prices are soaring sir :)
2079 2018-01-20 16:10:49 What do you like for long term dividend stocks. Sorry to butt into the convo. But I don’t want to trade forever and like residual cash flow
2080 2018-01-20 16:10:24 I bought a home, started a business, and bought a new car, as in new, not new to me used car. I even bought a few stocks. Guess I made good use of the rebounding economy. I didn’t lose sleep or worry about being nuked. I was just a toddler during Cuban missile crisis.
2081 2018-01-20 16:06:30 Liverpool apparently gets used a lot because the Georgian quarter is incredibly well preserved and also stands in for London because the dark brick work looks like the London (Kentish) yellow stocks before they were all de-sootified.
2082 2018-01-20 16:05:48 Well not quite if you look at the facts! In  the GoM. case we see nutrient runoff from ill or non-regulated or even enforcement thereof! This causes fish stock death and ecosystem collapse! In Somalia we have developed countries plundering fish stocks!!
2083 2018-01-20 16:05:42 I freely admit that much of the spending in the first year or 2 of President Obama's administration was drastically increased because of the recession. In the same vein I would hope you recognize that the increase in the value of stocks was a reflection of their bottoming out.

2088 2018-01-20 16:03:33 and I am saying nothing wrong with that and I don't disagree, but that is not the purpose of this PF. This PF is meant to actively trade penny stocks, putting the profits into long term dividend paying stocks to end up with a PF you can live off the cash flow.
2089 2018-01-20 16:02:29 Signs you’re becoming middle class.

2090 2018-01-20 16:00:20 I was totally confused at CEO level. Trading stocks I was 20+ games in but I made it lol. I had to learn to stop jumping jobs every 5 years to get to ceo level
2091 2018-01-20 16:00:01 Man I was in high school and didn’t pay attention to stocks crazy how low these stocks were!!

2093 2018-01-20 15:58:48 It means the Russia thing hasn’t worked, the racism thing hasn’t worked, the porn Star thing didn’t do anything, now his health is ok.

2096 2018-01-20 15:56:49 Thank you for watching. Don't think we talk about cryptos very often on OA though. Only time I recall mentioning them was in the context of implications for $CME and $CBOE and their bitcoin futures products. We try to stick to US listed single-stocks, etps and associated options.
2097 2018-01-20 15:56:38 Hanging must return to the public square. Shaming stocks would not hurt.
2098 2018-01-20 15:56:37 @TheBullBull hello sir many stocks which are doing well and listed on NSE as well but not available for but on ICICI direct or HDFCSEC is there any reason in specific . For example shrenik limited .
2099 2018-01-20 15:56:35 Very difficult in the diamond industry. What is there to buy besides stocks and a factory?
2100 2018-01-20 15:56:11 We need regulation for our ICO stocks and bonds.
2101 2018-01-20 15:55:24 Yeah, the truckloads of cash to rich corps made their stocks go up. Meanwhile, national debt keeps rising! Shame on you.
2102 2018-01-20 15:54:42 Blimey!!! I have just checked my bait freezer stocks ready for the start of my 2018 season and I have only got enough for               6 x Overnighters. Best I get an order in quickly.
2103 2018-01-20 15:54:17 If you want uninsured people to have preventative care contribute to your local charitable clinic there are tons of them everywhere. Invest in healthcare stocks, donate to doctors scholarships. More doctors and hospitals equal more affordable widely healthcare for everyone.

2107 2018-01-20 15:52:03 The Trump stock market surge has driven up stocks so high that it has rescued all the underfunded union pension funds.  While those unions were foolishly waiting for Democrats to rescue them.  #StockMarket #MAGA
2108 2018-01-20 15:50:44 POLL

Construction needs sand and the world is running out of sand stocks.

There is 1 listed company in India that has got permission to mine sand...

Can you guess its name?
2109 2018-01-20 15:50:22 Compared to April 2014 we have less stocks above the 200-MA, but are much higher...that's pretty scary!
2110 2018-01-20 15:48:44 I agree however I believe it will break through those resistances.   They have eliminated the debt off their balance sheet and have added 350 mil in assets.  There is only 650 mil shares total and dilution is over! How many sub penny stocks can say that?
2111 2018-01-20 15:48:18 Q1 earnings is exam time for stocks - I bet they have all reasons to fail and fail miserably
2112 2018-01-20 15:47:38 Hard-working Americans survive day today just to pay the bills and have seen the table don't have stocks in profits
2113 2018-01-20 15:46:28 as long as the wages of working people are kept stagnant corporate profits rise but said working people don't have stocks
2114 2018-01-20 15:45:18 Replenishment ng stocks! Yeeeesss thank youuuu 
2115 2018-01-20 15:44:16 Whats with these tweets?. Its like you guys are setting up the stage for when stocks crash all the blame will be on Tump
2116 2018-01-20 15:43:35 Any idea on which 50 stocks?
2117 2018-01-20 15:43:07 Let’s see how the stocks go on Monday...I see a drop, we can call that “Schumer’s stock shock “.....
2118 2018-01-20 15:43:03 I have a moderate amount of stocks, and a small 401k, but fact is not even a third of those in the bottom 50% of earners in the US own stocks. That is telling. These are residual effects of the Great Recession. Stock market gains benefit the richest Americans. These are facts.

2121 2018-01-20 15:40:31 I'm afraid of Canadian natural gas weighted stocks due to #Aeco problems, lack of market access and now warm weather.
2122 2018-01-20 15:36:56 stocks already at 52 week high
2123 2018-01-20 15:35:03 Já mám u České spořitelny zakoupené prémiové dluhové cenné papíry 1 a po necelých 3 letech jsem na nule. "PDCP" 2, 3, 4 něco málo vydělává. Za to TOP Stocks je úplně jiná písnička, ten mi vydělává nejvíce a zamazává veškeré ztráty. Jan Hájek je jednička! :-)

2126 2018-01-20 15:32:33 People putting crypto in their names is like anyone who trades in stocks putting stock in their name. Stupid!
2127 2018-01-20 15:32:03 Yeah, staying in the dorm since only have 2 semesters for studies (really packed learning schedule since it's a Matriculation program)

Well, meal plans are depending on the situations, usually go for the cafe if things didn't get much problems like out of stocks

2133 2018-01-20 15:30:16 So, explain to me, just bc some politicians think bump stocks are too dangerous, so they will come to ur house to take away ur legal purchased properties, or use their words "they ask u nicely to surrender it". If it happened, I wonder what they will take away from us next.
2134 2018-01-20 15:30:05 #StockMarket where is the money come from to create this bull market?  There is only a limited amount of money available to buy. Corporations bring back money to buy stocks? I really want to know.
2135 2018-01-20 15:29:55 That is a paradigm shift everyone must learn when transitioning from stocks to crypto. 
2136 2018-01-20 15:29:52 Stocks are up globally and the rise started following the global financial back in 2009. The rise under Trump had nothing to do him but rather the GOP controlling govt and clearing away for lower corporate taxes and thus higher earnings.
2137 2018-01-20 15:29:42 Nerozumím té definici negativního scénáře. Takže kdyz některá z těch firem ztratí 10% a víc tak klient dostane kupon 19,2% ale jen 90% jistiny? Bude stále v plusu? Nebo bude nulový kupon a 10% ztráta jistiny? Jsem jen fondar, vypadl jsem z nuancí jazyka strukturovacich marketeru

Of course stocks go up...when the govt hand $$ to corporations.

2153 2018-01-20 15:19:49 Pete! The Peruvian penny stocks might not be a good idea?
2154 2018-01-20 15:19:24 stocks are up
2155 2018-01-20 15:18:52 Will be interesting to see how the government shutdown will impact stocks on Monday morning. I think a bigger concern than the shutdown is the upcoming midterm elections. A Democratic takeover of Congress could stall the Trump pro-business agenda. $VOO
2156 2018-01-20 15:16:46 yg stocks' value prolly decreased bc of their artists issues  not bc of their artist being inactive bc boi they're active as hell

2160 2018-01-20 15:14:37 Stocks mightbe tremendously overnbought & overextended but its offset by lots of cash & good earnings therefore can still grind higher $SPY
2161 2018-01-20 15:13:37 There are 3 major CAPE concepts. 1. LT EPS growth is closely tied to nominal Econ growth, 2. Margins mean revert with the business cycle, and 3. Investors price stocks at their required rate of return, a function of EPS, RF rates and fear/greed. IMO no errors in these concepts.
2162 2018-01-20 15:12:37 Because supply and demand, economic theory, assumes humans are rational, and for buying goods and services they mostly are, but for stocks and markets we know they’re not.
2163 2018-01-20 15:12:26 Available na ulit.  Limited stocks!  No reservation muna sure buyers please 
2164 2018-01-20 15:11:28 Not to mention they scrambled to pass TaxCuts for rich but to hell with avg Citizens & after lies and lies nothing would be done about CHIP or DACA which Trump said he'd approve just the other day! 1.4 TRIL$ for the rich! Deficit skyrocket like the stocks for the rich!!

2171 2018-01-20 15:08:31 Economy was already on up swing. Stock market is at all time high but it's been rising since 44, also good portion of pop doesn't have stocks.

2185 2018-01-20 14:54:49 Not exactly sure. But I do know index funds are significantly cheaper than others. Yeah individual stocks are cheap. But the return on those is really minimal
2186 2018-01-20 14:54:36 You mean they are actually going to work? Taking time out from reviewing their wealth. (Stocks) Finding the energy to do the people’s work.  That’s the least we can expect from your dysfunction and the money we pay you!

2199 2018-01-20 14:46:21 Yes, the reason why stocks aren't fairly priced is because of an inherent 'probability' multiplier. Most miss that.
2200 2018-01-20 14:46:05 I don't like to take very large moves based on market valuations given the difficulty of timing. In times of high valuation I change my exposure mostly by not investing fresh savings into equity. Trim exposure to select stocks if needed.

2209 2018-01-20 14:41:13 I think it was very shortsighted of them to say a stocks value/price was ‘solely’ determined by supply and demand. Stocks aren’t produced and consumed. S&D doesn’t explain why people buy more of something when it goes up, and run out of the store when things are on sale.

2215 2018-01-20 14:37:05 And you are so uninformed The country is on an upward swing! Stocks are over the top, more jobs than people to fill them , Apple paying the government 38billion to bring their money back into this country and 20,000 jobs, tax cuts What part of any of that is bad??

2227 2018-01-20 14:23:17 Jesus. Half this is a lie. You guys seem to forget history. Trump has NOT broken any records other than stocks which only profit the rich and corps.  That was his goal. Line his own pockets. Duh!
2228 2018-01-20 14:23:14 There's no actual proof Trump is even a billionaire. His election financial disclosure only listed $165 million in cash,stocks, bonds and assets. You would think billionaires would have much much more.

-Here’s the truth, the gov't doesn’t shutdown.' All essential services continue. Don't believe lies." 
 "Stocks rose yesterday during the first day of government shutdown. Markets like being left alone for a day."
2231 2018-01-20 14:17:11 Hey CT can you explain this chart?

2245 2018-01-20 14:06:20 Look at 2004-2006, curve is flattening the whole time Fed is hiking. Stocks don't crack until well after Fed was done.
2246 2018-01-20 14:05:24 I think stocks only crack when Fed has hiked too far and econ is slowing.

2256 2018-01-20 13:58:26 One of those very few stocks that totally skipped the bull-run in the past few months. That was probably a tell-tale sign.
2257 2018-01-20 13:58:12 Unusual options activity allows you to find stocks before hedge funds get in!
2258 2018-01-20 13:58:03 For those worried about stocks tanking with a government shutdown. The market rose during 5 of the last 6 gov shutdowns. The one decline was very minimal. If it does pull back, fundamentals are strong. Companies are what matter. BUY BUY BUY.

2260 2018-01-20 13:56:08 The conversation stated around the valuation of the market and prices of stocks which is based on factors not speculation. Are you trying to misdirect or did you get confused somewhere. Speculation is present in trying to guess the future of things which isn't part of the value
2261 2018-01-20 13:54:16 I'll humour you with a reply despite the poor Mr T impression. "fool" your point "people won't invest in something they can't see" my point "pensions" "stocks" "insurances" "precious metals".etc & generally when u invest in gold you invest through a broker you don't see the gold.
2262 2018-01-20 13:54:06 I would say it helps the majority of the country? Retirement funds are invested in stocks.

2266 2018-01-20 13:52:10 Just two days ago a cab driver was talking about stocks and nifty.  Time to worry 
2267 2018-01-20 13:52:01 As far I know, they received new stocks.
2268 2018-01-20 13:51:26 GDP ending 2016: 18.57
GDP in Q3 2017: 19.501
That's only a 5% change.

Stocks using DOW Jones from Jan 2017 - Jan 20, 2018:
20,162.05 - 26,017.81
That's 29%

Guess math wasn't your strongest subject in school?
2269 2018-01-20 13:51:26 So fucking annoying when you wanna buy any heavy music on CD. No supermarket stocks it at all!!!! But you can guarantee James Blunt Back to Bedlam is always there for £3
2270 2018-01-20 13:51:13 This is not a credible argument. The volume of stocks owned is not important. With my $50k, I can't buY as much. But my $50k went up to $67k which is a pretty good percentage increase. Way better than any bond, money market, etc.  It may be a pittance but it's MY PITTANCE!
2271 2018-01-20 13:50:26 All over the country, people who depend on free government assistance are panicking, while winners cashed some stocks Friday and are pretty excited for a correction

2273 2018-01-20 13:47:16 This is why stocks should split or options shift from 100 share lots on high priced stocks.
2274 2018-01-20 13:46:20 They’re beholden to donors. How much cash have they taken from the defense industrial complex? How many of them own large quantities of stocks in those same companies?

2277 2018-01-20 13:44:19 The Officers involved in this campaign would agree with you wholeheartedly. The public who engaged with the naming posts online would disagree & that's one of my concerns - they are happy to have the village stocks recreated via SM. Pol probably shouldn't feed that.
2278 2018-01-20 13:44:05 Gago talaga nila di ako excited unang araw naglabas iPhone X after lunch out of stocks na raw pero mga Platinum subscribers sila pa tumawag para mag-alok mga hinayupak yan binabayaran ko monthly halos pang-Platinum na akala mo naman di nagbabayad! 
2279 2018-01-20 13:43:44 Unless you are in the top 1% you missing a lot of profit since the top 1% has almost 40% of the stock market, over 80% of Americans don't own stocks. Anyway, you admitted more than once that speculation is present in the market, I never planned to debate the amount of it.
2280 2018-01-20 13:43:38 In honor of Women's March today:

2284 2018-01-20 13:38:15 I feel like $SHW's management must really hate the cliche. 

Like I always say, You can make exciting returns in boring stocks. The names will put you to sleep, but loyal shareholders don't seem to mind.
2285 2018-01-20 13:36:03 Judith, laws change over time. Debtors are no longer put in the stocks. Women have voting rights. Things change as society changes. That was actually Trudeau’s point. Abortion is legal in Canada because that’s how the majority of Canadians want it. Now. Wasn’t always the case.

2291 2018-01-20 13:27:26 This is not accurate. Come on this type of tweets do not help us the people.
2292 2018-01-20 13:26:16 Just a distraction from high stocks and low unemployment. Go Pres. Trump.
2293 2018-01-20 13:24:07 3. Since Trump has been president the DOW and other stocks have increase 30% and more the largest growth in a year in HISTORY.
4. 2 million jobs added with more to come in the next 5 years because of what number 1 said.

2303 2018-01-20 13:14:22 Perspective: Trump was and is constantly badgered by MSM on EVERY word or action. Still:
Stocks are at record Gains.
Employment highest in 9 years.
Black unemployment at record lows.
Tax Bill bonuses everywhere.
New plants coming (Chrysler, Apple etc)
Consumer Outlook at a high.
2304 2018-01-20 13:14:12 @SenSchumer I totally agree with you on who's to blame for the shutdown, the WALL and the S*#thole tweets have to stop, We're the laughing stocks of the world, Keep up the good fight!

2306 2018-01-20 13:11:12 oh and we have already established their is speculation just not in the area you are thinking it is in.

2315 2018-01-20 13:04:11 Bank stocks also gained. Among public sector banks, Punjab National Bank  (up 3.22%), Union Bank of India (up 2.47%), State Bank of India (up  1.98%), Indian Bank (up 1.44%), IDBI Bank (up 0.5%) and Bank of Baroda  (up 1.63%) edged higher. Corporation Bank declined 0.51%.

2318 2018-01-20 13:01:30 It's always nice to have a back-up when a stock's growth falters. This is why dividend-paying stocks are attractive to many investors - even when prices drop you get a paycheck. (this is how I invest, and dspp)
2319 2018-01-20 13:00:57 Ya i heard about the sold out. Hopefully they have enough stocks the next time when i go visit. Thanks for the info anyways! Will definitely give the caramel macchiato a try!
2320 2018-01-20 13:00:07 Yep so innocent and seniors now apparently name and shame in some areas, public stocks now are media outlets and SM
2321 2018-01-20 12:59:53 The Common Fisheries Policy has been a disaster. Not only for British fisherman, their fleet, villages and communities, but also for fish stocks and the environment. Colossal waste & destruction. And unreformable!
2322 2018-01-20 12:57:52 Very interesting move by Igokea. Preston needed a spotlight to increase his draft stocks after the accident happened in Kansas. Huge defensive prospect, great athleticism #ABALiga
2323 2018-01-20 12:57:52 4. With purely financial firms, the book value can fluctuate with the market as these stocks tend to have a portfolio of assets that goes up and down in value.
2324 2018-01-20 12:56:39 Nothing stops said laborers from converting their paycheck to stocks every week.
2325 2018-01-20 12:56:20 Any plans of adding stocks?   Would love a one stop shop to see all investments.

2327 2018-01-20 12:54:43 Im so sick and tired of hearing about the stock market. #NeverTrump he still has not reached the 23% growth in the stocks that President Obama has. The economy was on the up tick when he came.
2328 2018-01-20 12:53:08 Oh god. Some of the white wine that catering stocks is legendary for being awful.
2329 2018-01-20 12:52:50 Give me a break about the stocks and bonds. LOL.  Why not just based on if 10%? I mean even just 5% percent is rationalization enough. You be rich, Buy now, why wait!?!
2330 2018-01-20 12:52:36 The big answer is Trump's slashing of Obama's strangling regulations on big and small businesses to allow them to increase investments in their own companies. America's business world then drove stocks up, which then drove unemployment down. Economics 101!
2331 2018-01-20 12:50:14 I m not out of equity even at this expensive valuation but I am loading on cash to get back heavily on to stocks when current greedy investors become fearful. I m confident that I will get lots of opportunities to invest in future. Decided to just hold and ride w/o new investment
2332 2018-01-20 12:50:10 GREAT first year MR President!!! Economy's kicking ass!!! Unemployed WAY down!!! Stocks up!!! Wages starting to increase!! You're right on the issues and we have a great economy!! What party told the American people that's what maters 20 yrs ago? Today they care about illegals!!
2333 2018-01-20 12:48:21 BREAKING: CIA Insider Reports Collapse of International Monetary System Now Imminent. If you are at all concerned about the U.S. dollar or you own any assets (like stocks or bonds) priced in it, then an urgent new warning from Jim Rickards is worth paying attention to.
2334 2018-01-20 12:48:04 Okay po will message you once the stocks are here. Thank you!
2335 2018-01-20 12:47:31 So basically your argument is that people on the poverty line should consider a solid stock portfolio to be of higher importance than food, water, shelter, and clothing?  Since they don't have enough money to afford all of those and you think some nice penny stocks should fit in.
2336 2018-01-20 12:47:02 Britannia has given 10 times safe return in last five years. Don't go for penny stocks. Buy Right sit tight
2337 2018-01-20 12:47:00 Ya........... looking around I don't know how I'll survive.  Pay increase, my stocks up, and less gov in my business. Terrible.
2338 2018-01-20 12:46:09 And when they see the decline they know is coming they will sell out their stocks and leave you with nothing. Good bye retirements and any investments. You wont even have medicaid,medicare,foodstamps or help with housing, trump is cutting their funding. R we winning yet???

2340 2018-01-20 12:45:25 Based on the Russell 3000 index, the stock market has gained $6.9 trillion to $30.6 trillion since The Don has taken office.  This reps. roughly 98 % of all US stocks.  Good for all of us, our 401k's, etc.  The wasted 8 years of the prior failed presidency was apologizing.
2341 2018-01-20 12:45:09 That's funny, bc the GOP under u n 45 chose to do nothing about bump stocks, and those things kill a lot more life, than Planned Parenthood.
2342 2018-01-20 12:45:07 No Agriculture and allied sector stocks are on fire.
2343 2018-01-20 12:43:40 Really? You Democrats are the real blame for the shutdown, our economy is booming, stocks are up, 401Ks booming, us blue collar people are seeing more money in are paychecks and starting to see progress in America for the first time in a very long time, you Dems need to get off
2344 2018-01-20 12:41:00 I was thinking the same thing about Twitter, if they continue rigging trends & banning people's speech people will start to bail & the stocks will be worthless. Twitter has become a SJW swamp!

2348 2018-01-20 12:37:35 Nonono. Bitcoin is created when people leave a penny and don’t take a penny at the register. A bit of that coin gets chopped up and mailed out through the internet tubes to people hoping to use them to buy penny stocks.

2350 2018-01-20 12:36:38 Smart. Defining your circle of competency is key. I learned that the hard way with tech stocks.

2366 2018-01-20 12:22:12 @jimcramer Psychologically, we need 2 accounts. 1 is buy&hold (min invested), 1 buy&sell (max invest). The B&H allows you to own "your companies" always, no matter what. The B&S is for treating stocks like pieces of paper with no attachment, hopefully the real money maker.
2367 2018-01-20 12:21:03 When you register a company, any company, even ones in different names, you have to register them somewhere to make you the legal owner. While the average joe may find it difficult to track, agencies that track stocks on exchanges can track it down in minutes.
2368 2018-01-20 12:18:01 True - my regular stocks have been going nuts lately (good nuts) so if there’s fear priced in can’t wait to see what happens when there’s not

2375 2018-01-20 12:14:00 DACA negotiations are important at THIS time.  This problem was placed on the back burner just like “‘bump stocks”’ after Las Vegas, “‘automatic weapons”’ after Sandy Hook, and like “‘background checks”’ after Columbine.
2376 2018-01-20 12:13:40 agree. Remember alleged sex offenders names, then wrong person targetted and attacked. Thats what really occurs, Name and Shame is the old Village Green stocks!! We grew out of that

2421 2018-01-20 11:39:13 It's not.  That's the magic.  It works well from some very specific perspectives.  The Dow is doing great!  That is great for people who own those stocks.

2585 2018-01-20 08:25:14 Your stocks have been manipulated.They have always been aparently tou know absolutely nothing about the market. Who owns it.and its day to 
day functioning...
2586 2018-01-20 08:24:12 Stocks mostly higher in afternoon action
2587 2018-01-20 08:24:01 Spot on. Most of these funds lack consistency. Each one of them are fully invested in most of Sensex and Nifty stocks. When market goes down these will also take a deep dive.

2590 2018-01-20 08:12:50 Can you explain how did trump drive up your stocks? How do you know they did not go up for other reasons?
2591 2018-01-20 08:12:49 Apple also stated the share holders will see the savings- not the employees. Shared/stocks and dividends go towards the company/corporations. Not economy or employee.
2592 2018-01-20 08:10:49 Very true. 
RiskOn money flow takes the markets high without any other limit. Once RiskOff outflow sets in, stocks start sinking.
2593 2018-01-20 08:10:45 The graph doesn't adjust for inflation,
Employment figures include all apprenticeships and steps to work which isn't meaningful employment.
Fste100 is heavily subsided to allow corporate stock investment. Stocks up - Wages Collapse = Meaningless.

2605 2018-01-20 07:49:29 you really can't argue with another person's belief, whether it would be politcal, buying #cryptocurrency or #stocks. same with buying a particular #altcoin. its not your job to convince them otherwise.

2606 2018-01-20 07:49:24 for now yes. minus a few on small exchanges that I was too lazy to save from the drop and double them up. Unless you want to day trade the dips and spikes, I'm fairly certain it is going to be quiet for while. shifted most assets to stocks. $QNC ;)
2607 2018-01-20 07:47:03 On the news of US Fed govt shut down stocks will fall and crypto may rise. Alts prepare for stop losses. staying in btc is better when it runs. then enter alts dips when btc moves sideways.

2613 2018-01-20 07:42:57 $200 trillion in #stocks #cash #bonds #gold around the world ... all 4 overvalued. If 2% of that ends up in #crypto you have a $4 trillion total market cap; 7X where we are today. If $BTC #bitcoin holds its current market share ... that would put the price at $80,000.
2614 2018-01-20 07:38:36 The economy was already improving under Obama. 76 consecutive  months of job growth, 4.6% UR, stocks tripled, low gas prices etc. Most of ISIS claimed territory was already lost under Obama! Shut off Fox, research BLS!

2621 2018-01-20 07:30:52 Well, if you are implying market forces dictate valuation, well, that’s literally true of everything in a non command and control economy. But stocks and bonds have intrinsic value that is at least estimable, if not precisely calculable; crypto-currencies do not.

2625 2018-01-20 07:29:44 Yup, go heavily into stocks, mutual funds, etc. while they are still cheap.

Prepare for a prosperous retirement.
2626 2018-01-20 07:27:55 Yeah...Still can't lead...
Not like Obama could...
Remember when Obama led Congress to reform taxes sending stocks soaring and business flooding back into the US creating more jobs and higher wages?
Oh yeah...that was Trump.
2627 2018-01-20 07:26:24 Yup, while stocks last - before they go game over!

2631 2018-01-20 07:24:16 The news sometimes has an affect on this market, but honestly 99% of the time the news correlates with the charts so who knows whether it's manipulation or pure trading. I took @NodeInvestor course when I first joined crypto a while ago. I knew a little about trading from stocks.
2632 2018-01-20 07:22:34 Stocks actually represent fractional ownership in real companies with real assets. Unless you are talking about pink sheet penny stocks, which are actually a pretty good analog for crypto-currencies.
2633 2018-01-20 07:21:46 Stock pushers, ofcourse the economyth will say that. Stocks, Bonds, Tbills are all speculative tools.
2634 2018-01-20 07:21:09 “Investing” in stocks is usually actually “speculating “ in stocks.

2636 2018-01-20 07:18:32 You damage your credibility by agreeing with this. He's predicting what happens in 11 years based on "technical analysis" voodoo? And he's making a nonsensical equilibrium argument--money doesn't flow "into" or "out of" bonds/stocks. They simply exchange hands at various prices.

2655 2018-01-20 07:02:46 Netflix, Twitter, Snapchat, Uber, Tesla, those companies knows how to play the market so their shareholders don't panic and tank the company by dumping their stocks.

They know how to keep you interested.

2674 2018-01-20 06:47:30 Isn't he though?? Amazing how stocks seem to follow what Trump says but it is all Obama. I often wonder how that works. It it like a ventriloquist throwing his voice? Just Obama throwing his economic greatness?
2675 2018-01-20 06:45:18 Majority of stockholders are not the working class. So working class who they state will get help won’t see that money. Who does buy stocks upper class. You might say well they have 401k. Well what good will it do many if they can’t touch that money as they live check to check.

2683 2018-01-20 06:32:20 No shit. Random stocks huh?
2684 2018-01-20 06:32:14 Gotta look into investing index funds. Don't buy individual stocks. Too much risk for too little reward. But that's about all I know. I'm not even sure how to buy any :/

2690 2018-01-20 06:25:35 TRUMP BRAGS ABOUT TANKING HEALTH INSURANCE STOCKS.
2691 2018-01-20 06:23:39 Year 2017 anti-flu vax stocks have been identified in the past years.
2692 2018-01-20 06:23:34 And yet job growth still stumbled last year. Just because businesses/stocks are doing well doesn’t mean jobs are being added. Trickle down economics have never worked and we’ll probably see another recession soon.
2693 2018-01-20 06:22:37 Making this type of brash decision is a betrayal of public trust & the fiduciary rule. Willing to bet his private money is still invested. These stocks are “defensive” & making other people’s money socially responsible without their permission is reckless. I await the lawsuits.
2694 2018-01-20 06:22:21 Exactly.  They serve the 1% (taxes and stocks).  Obama did in ISIS please stop with your revisionist history
2695 2018-01-20 06:21:58 Not true. Government shut down is good for $JNUG and gold stocks.
2696 2018-01-20 06:21:32 Bro

So it will be interesting to see what NYSE does on Monday. Even after some successful revenue reports from last CY.

Stocks rose yesterday during the first day of government shutdown. Markets like being left alone for a day.

Im not into stocks.
2712 2018-01-20 06:04:22 No views about the market as a whole but some good stocks might have started correcting giving a good buying opportunity.
2713 2018-01-20 06:01:54 That’s what I heard McConnell saying..
2714 2018-01-20 06:01:10 Have you heard of any upcoming news or filing?
2715 2018-01-20 06:00:42 If it’s tru ? 
In last 2/3 month $\€ are gone High why ?
As per economics surpluses of stocks rates go down.... 
$ might go under ₹ 60 instead of 65
2716 2018-01-20 06:00:40 Hope she’s not DRIVING!
2717 2018-01-20 06:00:26 Let me correct that, within bitcoin i only trade the GBTC, not the bitcoin on the coin exchanges.  Mainly i still trade mostly stocks.
2718 2018-01-20 05:59:33 economy is best shape it's been in many years, lowest unemployment in history, stocks booming with 70+ record highs ... what's failing? your comprehension!
2719 2018-01-20 05:59:15 My Stocks are good. Fantastic
2720 2018-01-20 05:59:14 Just ended my stream and it was razy lit. We got raided by Stocks (idk his @) and just straight up an AMAZING stream
2721 2018-01-20 05:54:37 Furthermore, I’m making a lot of $ in market since it’s a free for all now that Wall Street regulations have been peeled way back and even with that I’m still anti Trump cuz millions aren’t as well off & aren’t gaining shit from stocks.
2722 2018-01-20 05:53:04 Chris, I like your stuff and the challenge but you are misreading the accounts. The SD note related to stocks held, it's a small figure. SD do fulfillment for lots of clubs. It's profitable
2723 2018-01-20 05:49:26 Market can't keep going up indefinately, Li stocks have had a great run since xmas combined with SQM news and Roskill report it spooked some people. It may drop some more but will recover. Expecting green next week.

2728 2018-01-20 05:40:37 If Trump is to be credited for the economy and stock market performance, shouldn't we be upset that international stocks outperformed domestic stocks this past year?
2729 2018-01-20 05:40:35 Chilling out waiting for a stock market correction. Will be buying when the majority are running out the door. As Warren Buffett says "wealth is transferred from the impatient to the patient". Residential Property is my main game. Only will buy stocks in bear markets.
2730 2018-01-20 05:40:19 Liberal twitter skewing the numbers...liberal Carl stick to stocks
2731 2018-01-20 05:39:56 #governmentshutdown: stocks & the dollar to gap down, bonds and gold to gap up. This is helping #bitcoin, which in turn is driving all crypto up on the perfect breakout. Stay long. #trading #stocks #fx $USDJPY #gold #crypto
2732 2018-01-20 05:39:14 ISRA's broad-based #BIGI index is also used by two of #Israel's largest asset managers for three local index products, and @BlueStarIsrael analyses Israeli stocks listed on seven exchanges to construct our indexes (@TASE_en @Nasdaq @NYSE @LSEplc @ASX @SGX & @HKEXGroup )  2/2

2734 2018-01-20 05:38:38 It’s like investing in stocks basically
2735 2018-01-20 05:38:04 Victims are go funding hospital bills, the NRA is potentially working with Russians. Republicans can’t even manage to ban bump stocks and there was a huge pro life parade today. Anyone else sick and tired of this bull shit???
2736 2018-01-20 05:35:13 Great to learn this @lecontewealth - I ndorse this idea.  #Israel provides developed market stability & standards w/#EmergingMarket-like growth potential 

Broad & deep exposure is the way to start, and the $ISRA #ETF tracks the @BlueStarIsrael #BIGI benchmark of 134 stocks  1/2
2737 2018-01-20 05:34:14 Julius Randle is a good player. But he needs to go. Lakers should trade him while stocks are high.
2738 2018-01-20 05:33:46 Thank you Mr. President,  my stocks are growing and growing.
2739 2018-01-20 05:33:32 Honestly Jason, it's a giant ponzi scheme. These crypto currencies aren't based upon anything of actual value, except consumer confidence. Unlike stocks where you are buying into a company or companies.
2740 2018-01-20 05:32:34 You are Linda in a professional sub group that wears burkin stocks allot.
2741 2018-01-20 05:31:27 Yes she's checking stocks then refunding
2742 2018-01-20 05:31:24 Record Stocks .... 401Ks exploding, repatriating billions in off shore taxes, wages rising without legislation, corps giving bonuses, corps opening new US operations ... NOT TIRED OF WINNING.

2745 2018-01-20 05:28:43 出かけるの久々すぎて目的を忘れた
2746 2018-01-20 05:28:22 it's normal to many ppl. Nothing wrong with it. Even using 4% of funds. Look at all the stocks that make that in a day
2747 2018-01-20 05:28:18 Really! Have u been paying attention. President Trump has brought jobs back, stocks r thru the roof, unemployment  is @ it's lowest.
  Real leadership did that. Check your 401K & thank our President. Shut down belongs to the Dems. It's about DACA & not Americans
2748 2018-01-20 05:27:45 What if I buy stock in PNC bank, sell that stock at higher price, and then pay back PNC For my student loans, with money earned from trading their stocks??? #LoopHole #SmarterNotHarder
2749 2018-01-20 05:26:27 Under the garb of All Time Highs, distribution happening in non index stocks!! Time for Risk Management!!
2750 2018-01-20 05:26:21 double the stocks and slash gas prices, fuck yeah
2751 2018-01-20 05:25:54 I think you will change stance on him when things start get n even better. Stocks, economy and energy best in all nations except Israel.
2752 2018-01-20 05:25:51 Sarah, I’m so tired of winning! NOT!! 
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump is making us euphoric with booming stocks, home values and tax cut!
2753 2018-01-20 05:25:04 I didn't know bots could own stocks...
2754 2018-01-20 05:24:50 I don’t have to do this for a living. I’m an RN who also does stocks and reads. What I said is true and history doesn’t show consistently that what you’re saying is accurate. It isn’t cut and dried like that. But you can still see trends...
2755 2018-01-20 05:24:22 I think the regular stock market is gonna dip hard next week. Stocks have been run up, I think people are trying to gain last minute profits before the government shuts down. Wouldn't be surprised if this caused a surge in crypto either. This is pure speculation.
2756 2018-01-20 05:24:15 Mirae and other fund houses have 50-60 stocks in one scheme mostly
2757 2018-01-20 05:24:06 I wonder did those antis loss some Rice stocks in their home when they didn't talk shit about BLACKPINK? So obsessed.
2758 2018-01-20 05:23:26 same once i get better at stocks ima rescue hella dogs an be happy
2759 2018-01-20 05:22:58 Much respect Broham. I realized , I learn new stuff about the world and stocks every day. It's a beautiful thing. The key is to take your profits.
2760 2018-01-20 05:22:55 it also for some reason doesnt count "business interests" as "stocks"...weird...sure looks pretty though
2761 2018-01-20 05:22:37 You own 9 Kongoogle stocks. You got NOTHING to worry about!
2762 2018-01-20 05:22:23 Its clear that you don't trade stocks for a living. In a bear market a profitable company will likely go down. In a bull market utter garbage will likely go up. If presidents made the market go up you should worship Obama. But they don't. If markets go up because of debt, its bad
2763 2018-01-20 05:22:01 That's sound advice for stocks. If you are talking crypto it is bad advice. Crypto markets don't open or close, they are constantly moving and do not stop. They also move an order of magnitude faster than the stock market. It's an entirely different paradigm.
2764 2018-01-20 05:20:05 Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. forex stocks
2765 2018-01-20 05:19:44 -2 This is the consumer confidence. B) the initial public offering of stocks are based on a companies’ actual value. After that it’s emotionally driven. The country can b in debt but if ppl are confident in it they will still buy stocks. C) I’m not the only one who knows this

2768 2018-01-20 05:17:58 Most of The Time Stocks Are Subject to Irrational & Excessive Price Fluctuations in Both Directions as The Consequence of The Ingrained Tendency of Most People to Speculate or Gamble … to Give Way to Hope, Fear and Greed. ~ Graham's #2BReminder
2769 2018-01-20 05:17:32 #stocks #StockMarket and #SHUTDOWN? What happens
2770 2018-01-20 05:17:19 Sigh...A) businesses come into being and expand and sell shares to generate cash and encourage ppl to but more of their stuff out of loyalty. Ppl buy stocks which are shares of those companies bc they believe the companies will be profitable ergo the ppl themselves will profit.
2771 2018-01-20 05:14:58 What will this dern shut down so to my stocks.... LET ME SEE SOMETHING...
2772 2018-01-20 05:14:08 Stocks just go higher no matter what. Especially tech stocks. Particularly companies that I have heard of or use their products. Specifically those that have heavy weighting in the major indices.
2773 2018-01-20 05:13:32 Trump is high on his drama drug. 

And since the stock market may pull back slightly now, consider how his tantrums create enough controlled chaos to benefit rich cronies, who can more buy stocks at lower prices. And blame Dems for the disruption.
2774 2018-01-20 05:12:49 My Bitcoin and Ethereum stocks are up since the government shut down. That's no coincidence.
2775 2018-01-20 05:12:48 #Vegas shooters photos of room were released and none of the photos show "thousands of rounds of Ammunition, or Bump Stocks on the guns." @CNN @FoxNews #guns #shooting
2776 2018-01-20 05:12:32 50 - 60? Last time I counted, total stocks of all Motilal put together was 62 stocks (across funds). One fund = 22 - 23 stocks
2777 2018-01-20 05:11:46 I will also point out many blockchain stocks were hit hard recently due the bitcoin correction. That on top of the short, speculators and traders who didn't carefully research the company resulted in a cluster-F$@& of a stock crash.
2778 2018-01-20 05:11:33 Are you nuts. The money we've made in stocks is awesome.
2779 2018-01-20 05:11:27 Mr President, you have to tell AG Sessions and The ATF to back off from regulating bump stocks. They are gonna open the Pandora's box that is gonna make possible to ban all semi autos, mags, everything that got you elected as pro gun President.Make them STOP IT! @realDonaldTrump
2780 2018-01-20 05:11:01 $200 trillion in #stocks #cash #bonds #gold around the world ... all 4 overvalued. If 2% of that ends up in #crypto you have a $4 trillion total market cap; 7X where we are today. If $BTC #bitcoin holds its current market share ... that would put the price at $80,000.

2785 2018-01-20 05:09:47 U.S government shutdown mean all non-essential U.S government offices close, essential ones stay open but workers don't get paid. This last occurred in 2013. Historically has led to some short term turbulence for stocks.

2788 2018-01-20 05:08:48 #USgovernmentshutdown and I’m just hoping pennyland stocks stay hot on Monday.
2789 2018-01-20 05:08:17 E don start Bro. Those Wall Street guys pull stunt yesterday. Many big stocks rose by an average 0.30%, by 7am today, de for don cast. Lol
2790 2018-01-20 05:07:36 Maybe you should report on how Isis is being crushed, border crossings way down, employment up, stocks up, tax bill passed. Liberals are getting destroyed by @realDonaldTrump right now. #MAGA 
2791 2018-01-20 05:07:02 No, you don't, you're just too stupid to realize it. Trumps first year is worse than Obama's last in literally every category. If you're betting your future on stocks, you're going to be sorry. Only a fool or a rich man relies on the stock market.
2792 2018-01-20 05:06:03 Thanks for wishes. 
Sir though me made good money in investing in stocks like page cera kajaria gruh nbcc etc all multiplied from 10 to 60 times in last 8 years but somehow messed up in trading generally in risk management part. Hope to learn that only. Yes 50k huge money

2797 2018-01-20 05:00:36 I hope to get confirmation of this once my one friend who speak french agrees to call them (he knows nothing about stocks, and I hope he does this as a favour).... $SX
2798 2018-01-20 04:59:02 It was more a similarity in the opportunity to buy cheap stocks/real estate in 2008, just like the opportunity to buy cheap Bitcoin. Nothing to do with fiat vs crypto.
2799 2018-01-20 04:58:29 yeah I was meaning shares. I also have their other Public traded stocks at least 3 times what they paid for them, and Plus Products supposed to IPO as well
2800 2018-01-20 04:58:10 Economy we have now unemployment going down and the stocks going up since 2009 and more jobs created in his last year than trumps first so what has trump done? Oh wait he is fastest president to a shutdown in history
2801 2018-01-20 04:58:08 Why do democrats approve giving billions in subsidies to healthcare companies for the ACA when healthcare stocks have quadrupled under the ACA. Cut those subsidies then. There’s your funding.
2802 2018-01-20 04:57:55 I was being facitious when I called teachers rich.  The point is teachers unions invest heavily in stocks.  It’s not just the rich that benefit.
2803 2018-01-20 04:57:23 Economy we have now unemployment going down and the stocks going up since 2009 and more jobs created in his last year than trumps first so what has trump done? Oh wait he is fastest president to a shutdown in history

2805 2018-01-20 04:54:34 I have decent positions in all those stocks . LIB being my largest of the bunch averaged in with 300k shares at .12 , then MMJ 100k at .015 and UMB 30k shares  at .03. Lg I missed until .39 Abcan I'm in at .85 I've never been a follower but u pick good stocks

2807 2018-01-20 04:51:24 Bettin on rappers is like bettin on stocks lol
2808 2018-01-20 04:50:01 I'm jus tryna buy stocks in pharmaceuticals
2809 2018-01-20 04:45:39 We can't deny that. My stocks have tripled since January of last year
2810 2018-01-20 04:45:09 Yes, but as of now we are recommending these funds until we come across some other that suits our investing style. 50-60 stocks in a fund isn't it too diversified. Any take?
2811 2018-01-20 04:44:11 I hate people who be faking just venting... shiiid I love Mariah, Tennis,
Stocks, and will still listen to trap music
2812 2018-01-20 04:43:53 @W9 Cet après-midi sur W9 téléfilms : obsession maladive, dangereuse alchimie, sous l'emprise du mal, vous êtes la TNT une télé de misère, de tristesse, que faites vous de vos stocks de films sympas, romantiques, programmation le week-end affreuse, quelle pauvreté télévisuelle !
2813 2018-01-20 04:42:33 Yes. But that’s when you should take profits never buy more when a stocks goes from .14 cents too 2.90
2814 2018-01-20 04:40:20 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
2815 2018-01-20 04:39:51 Maybe the stocks blow off 25-30 points more on $SPX basis early next week, but it would only mark a top easier.
2816 2018-01-20 04:39:22 The evil don is trying to use the stock market as being a good thing, pay attention: Remember the dotcom boom then crash? This is what happens when stocks climb to fast, they become unstable, wait and see!
2817 2018-01-20 04:36:48 WALL STREET might be booming bitch, but Wallstreet is NOT the economy. Its a sales venue for stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and futures. Economy is based off the production and sales of goods and services at home and abroad to consumers. That economy sucks!
2818 2018-01-20 04:35:22 Stocks, housing, crypto, it’s been like this for over a year.
2819 2018-01-20 04:30:14 Thanks.. all my stocks are in red but market touchng new highs..
2820 2018-01-20 04:28:35 Bruhhhhhhh, the returns are crazy. I'm gonna take my earnings and invest it in stocks and currency

2824 2018-01-20 04:26:03 so ayun. she's taking money from the shop again to buy stocks for her online shop -_-
2825 2018-01-20 04:24:04 Weird, so @RobinhoodApp giving away stocks to acquire new customers?
2826 2018-01-20 04:23:24 I’m glad I moved all my stocks out of the domestic market this am!  #TrumpShutdown
2827 2018-01-20 04:23:23 Today really got the lazy feeling to work and the fact that have to run stocks is just uurrrggghhh 
2828 2018-01-20 04:23:15 Always keep 20% cash aside. Applying SL is a pain but far better than 'bleeding profusely' & STICK to Fundamental stocks Always
2829 2018-01-20 04:23:14 Nope, it hasn't.  Our stocks and 401k went sky high, both received generous raises, paid off debt, and are generally feeling way more secure than we have in 9 years. #MAGA
2830 2018-01-20 04:22:54 e621でstocksで出てくる拘束具が好きなんだけど、日本語訳がわからない
2831 2018-01-20 04:22:46 Ha. Stocks. Let me guess you took a beating in stocks from 2009 to 2017. And that real estate that I'm pretty positive you don't own only went up last year? Oh you mean. Wait. 2017 has worse stock performance than every year but 3 in last 8. You don't say.
2832 2018-01-20 04:20:37 Not sure why the 60% is needed to keep the doors totally open. Gov. employees still get paid, when it all figured out. However, stocks markets will shift on Monday.
2833 2018-01-20 04:19:57 Well you need to open an IRA and buy some stocks. Maybe start a business. Have you thought about your options?
2834 2018-01-20 04:19:34 Anybody invest in stocks?
2835 2018-01-20 04:19:18 hopefully my stocks can finance a new laptop soon.
2836 2018-01-20 04:16:20 They already have one—It’s called Penny Stocks!
2837 2018-01-20 04:15:17 Wait a minute...the govt ran out of money??? But the stocks are at the highest...and look at the unemployment numbers...and the tax break...and and and...lol...come on boys...just borrow more money from China...they own you anyway
2838 2018-01-20 04:14:27 People who owned Penny stocks for Medicinal weed are laughing at this.
2839 2018-01-20 04:14:13 We need to stop bump stocks!!! Let's fight for more gun control!
2840 2018-01-20 04:14:13 ALL OF MY STOCKS ARE DOWN, INCLUDING APPLE. 
2841 2018-01-20 04:13:48 Sir, I think the most important problem has been selecting the right business. I might have traded in 70-80 stocks last year, but could found only few stocks (like Sterlite) that sustained corrections. This rule of investing requires maturity and vision. We newbies need to learn.

2901 2018-01-20 03:19:16 Lol hash tagging your tweets #woke doesn’t make you seem smart. If you can’t handle the ups and downs of the stock market, you should move your dollars out of stocks.

2957 2018-01-20 02:46:58 They facilitate the trade. There’s always someone on the other side. Be great full most stocks are liquid with willing buys and sellers. Better than OTC:BB were often times not.
2958 2018-01-20 02:46:53 Tina, sell your stocks, close your 401k, be sure to donate your excess pay next month, and of course any tax savings you get when you file next year. After all, you are not a hypocrite.
2959 2018-01-20 02:45:55 We all help each other through investments and don’t believe in putting my stamp on it claiming my pick on any stocks. We learn about new stocks and selectively do our dd. Very happy for you making a big profit out of $glyc trade, hope u holding a core position
2960 2018-01-20 02:44:34 Really interested to see if the Senior Bowl coaches will force guys like James Washington and DJ Chark to play in the short and intermediate game. Could do a lot for both draft stocks.
2961 2018-01-20 02:43:42 GDP went up 3.5% under Trump (it was only 1.5% on Obama's best year) and unemployment went down. Stocks set records. The Labor participation rate is up, and welfare numbers are down. record retail sales during the holidays, consumer confidence at 20 year high.
2962 2018-01-20 02:43:40 You do realize that the Democrats had a super majority and could’ve passed universal healthcare when Obama was first elected – they wouldn’t even give us a public option. Obama care was a giveaway to big Pharma and big Healthcare- their stocks went up when it was passed.
2963 2018-01-20 02:42:59 If you catch me staring at my phone, I’m more than likely checking my stocks.

2965 2018-01-20 02:40:02 A super religious lady came into my office today and said she likes trump because of what he’s doing to her stocks. That’s all she cares about. It’s sickening
2966 2018-01-20 02:39:20 You are an idiot. MM's & Algos know exactly where the stops are and short stocks daily to drive the price down to trigger the stop so they get your shares cheaply. Just stick to the old adage buy low, sell high and stop pretending you really know how the market works.
2967 2018-01-20 02:38:33 I just sent an activist hedge fund freind of mine 3 stocks that could double with a new CEO and corporate structure. Similar to D.E. Shaw’s #HomeDepot #Lowes argument
2968 2018-01-20 02:38:30 If interested in #investing #stocks/commodities/bonds, #ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are good options. ETFs are the funds tracking almost anything such as stock indices (e.g. #TSX), gold, oil & etc. Even one can profit from #market decline (short position) by buying inverse ETFs!
2969 2018-01-20 02:38:18 The same stocks that did better in Obama's first year than Trumps?
2970 2018-01-20 02:37:05 If you're trading off charts and codes have to agree . Make hay while the sun shines.

Fwiiw it took me a long time to learn to never sell good stocks . Sooner or later they go vertical and you have to be prepared to ignore the overall market to get rich.
2971 2018-01-20 02:36:31 This is big fat lie!

2978 2018-01-20 02:27:48 The government will not stop, just hype from you unhappy people, bet you are not crying about your 401K and stocks
2979 2018-01-20 02:27:13 No I’m with IntensityStocks. Not from your group. I just like anything that has to do with stocks so I follow a bunch of people. Lol
2980 2018-01-20 02:26:43 60% of my investments
r in some pretty aggressive stocks. I don't always look both ways when I cross the street. I've been known to have a 2nd glass of wine w/ my dinner, every now & then. I once went to c a movie, walked across the hallway, saw a 2nd movie. Didn't pay 'til after

2984 2018-01-20 02:23:00 I wanna get into stocks
2985 2018-01-20 02:21:47 We are witnessing a #BattleRoyale between passive pumped, trend following stock buyers and QT weary bond owners. 

Total bond market is much larger than equities so inversion would mean stocks got tossed out of the ring.
2986 2018-01-20 02:19:19 People buy property where they are expected to get possession in 2-3 years and end up getting it in 4-5 years.

In stocks, the same folks exit within few days if don't get 20% ..
2987 2018-01-20 02:19:17 I will pray for you
Oh,and if you have a 401k or stocks....look at them & pinch yourself. I’m blocking you. I don’t associate with morons
2988 2018-01-20 02:18:51 Not frustrated just pointing out you ALL are dreaming if you truly believe BYC goes back up to 25K
I’m not losing Money on BTC as it’s tanking, I don’t own any, so WHY? would I be frustrated? I made $56 on MY REAL STOCKS yesterday, another $15 today THEY ARE “STILL” going up!
2989 2018-01-20 02:18:38 Yup.   Buffett got a "deal" on some of these stocks. Like $GS.
2990 2018-01-20 02:18:19 Someone should ck on stocks that were sold off today !!!!!!
2991 2018-01-20 02:17:57 So you pulled your money out of stocks when Trump won.  Apparently millions of people are betting with their own money your are wrong.  The USA has the most generous immigration policy in the world, and it's still not enough, millions more still want to come here.
2992 2018-01-20 02:16:25 Tiny crashes - yes.

Big crashes:
1. Low interest rates + fractional banking =  INFINITE money for banks.
2. People borrow to invest and prices go super-high (housing, stocks, etc.)
3. Some people default and it starts a chain reaction down.
4. People's money bails out banks.
2993 2018-01-20 02:13:47 Focus on winner stocks.
Forget loser stocks.

2995 2018-01-20 02:12:53 Yes, but crypto is a slippery slope. Its unreliable and not real. Its not physical unlike stocks.
2996 2018-01-20 02:12:36 I'm saying 401K players CANNOT play with their stocks in real time.  Only on an end-of-day basis.  #WOKE
2997 2018-01-20 02:12:34 Shared this perspective in a client review today (,20 minutes). 

Bull case for stocks
  1 earnings don't suck
  2 tax reform
  3 the trend is your friend
Bear Case
  1 valuations suck
  2 flat yield curve
  3 epic global debt binge

2999 2018-01-20 02:09:52 Bumbling Bitcoin after vapid week staggers down to all time low, $650. Shock absorbed by market support at bottom, stocks a roll to $1083 finally node diving to $1.00 and less than .50 cents.
3000 2018-01-20 02:09:30 Sometimes I blame it to the ticker, liquidity and ease to trade in stocks develop this behaviour.
3001 2018-01-20 02:09:30 Sharply lower bonds prices this week coupled with a modest upside key reversal with the greenback makes this coming week more than interesting for entire Big Four: stocks, bonds,currencies n currencies.
3002 2018-01-20 02:09:08 O never had even 1 year of 3% GDP growth, #Trump is on track to have that hsi FIRST year and beyond. Stocks did ok under O because interest rates were so low they drove people into stock market. Deregulation is fueling it now. Pay attention. Knowledge is power. Get some!
3003 2018-01-20 02:08:00 Is “disruption” being caused by a) artificially low interest rates and associated willingness to fund unprofitable businesses, or b) mass collaboration and sharing enabled by technology / global communications networks? #stocks #investing @mill_investors @DougKass @hussmanjp
3004 2018-01-20 02:03:46 Lol...get a loan for the bathroom, leave the stocks to grow!! Eventually I take some for a splurge of some sort
3005 2018-01-20 02:03:32 You can now lose your money in stocks, bonds, options, and bitcoin. Same risk.
3006 2018-01-20 02:03:06 I hate not knowing what I did or if I did something to be treated this way
3007 2018-01-20 02:02:48 b*tches come around when the stocks up
3008 2018-01-20 02:02:20 only until stocks last!
3009 2018-01-20 02:01:50 Will do!  Unfortunately our library only really stocks Hindi films, it can be very hard to track down regional cinema.

3012 2018-01-20 02:00:42 I found that many traders fixate in individual stocks rather than on running complete portfolios.  They say "this is a nice company" and "the market ultimately goes up". They effectively put themselves at a very high financial and psychological risk.

3015 2018-01-20 01:59:56 The organization in charge of promoting #Amazon2STL were tweeting when someone said “ St. Louis is getting laughed at and is becoming the laughing stocks of the Midwest.” Well, you can’t bash St. Louis then try to promote it to Amazon. It doesn’t work that way 
3016 2018-01-20 01:59:12 They don't move like typical "penny stocks" and I feel that is what people fail to understand. It's a whole new ball game and the returns are unbelievable if played correctly.
3017 2018-01-20 01:57:20 If you have the audacity to tell me that sports betting is haram however, you invest in stocks, go FUCK yourself.
3018 2018-01-20 01:56:37 Reading so much about stocks I ended up typing “stocks” into laptop as my password wtf
3019 2018-01-20 01:56:04 Mr. O’Reilly the problem with stops is that if there is an event often that price will be violated significantly in a much lower price will execute on those stocks. For example last week when the ICBM alert came if that had been during market hours you would gotten screwed.
3020 2018-01-20 01:55:35 As a retired teacher, I want to to thank you Jim for all the work you and your show has done for the journeyman investors like myself. FB, Nvcr, utx, crm, fhn, hormel, and many other stocks I have invested in by watching your show. Thanks again, you are much appreciated, GM
3021 2018-01-20 01:55:01 I don’t agree. Yet again, goomba of crypto, with his bullshit predictions that never come to fruition. Steer clear ladies and gents. This guy is off his rocker. Read the journal for a few years and then play with stocks before you step in the big leagues.
3022 2018-01-20 01:54:02 I've shorted stocks a couple of times. How do I short crypto? 
Thanks guys for the help.
3023 2018-01-20 01:53:50 The powers are using this government shutdown facade to further degrade the middle class and the poor.  I mean think about it.  Corporations got their tax break, stocks are soaring, and the IRS has record tax revenue.  Yet many Americans don't have access to healthcare...
3024 2018-01-20 01:53:08 ... Something they can't do with Stocks so that's something we need to focus on.

3027 2018-01-20 01:50:45 That’s absolutely hilarious that you think the middle class are the shareholders I was referring to.Over 80% of stocks in the USA are owned by the top 10%. The stock market should hit 30k very soon with all the billions corps will now have to buyback shares & inflate stock prices
3028 2018-01-20 01:50:15 What if you could buy stocks using the gift card for the store your gift card is for? 
3029 2018-01-20 01:46:52 Wish I owned stocks in antipsychotics!! In this economy and with this news-I could retire extremely well!!
3030 2018-01-20 01:45:59 Funny what a central bank with a printing press can do! Devaluing the currency always inflates stocks.

3032 2018-01-20 01:45:49 Plus idc about Travis and his group. He focuses on penny stocks. Have you even looked at my time line? I trade big stocks mostly like tesla and alibaba and nvidia. I’m not broke like you guys. I can afford actual stocks
3033 2018-01-20 01:45:46 @zerosum24 my experience is chasing winners at the worst time is worse than buying dips in underperforming stocks, as long as they can start to perform some day soon. Idk what your thoughts are?

3035 2018-01-20 01:44:06 SChummer wants  to crash the economy because he hates the good news. Higher stocks, profitable 401ks, and pension plans, bonuses, higher wages, repatriation of billions to create more jobs, lower unemployment for blacks and Hispanics. Pathetic.
3036 2018-01-20 01:43:42 my mom is telling me about her coworker and how he’s rich because he bought stocks in facebook when it first started out. if i didn’t hate capitalism before u can bet i do now

3046 2018-01-20 01:34:36 Oh word? That’s why stocks fall when company’s earnings fall short? Or a world event (indictment ) sends Dow lower? Or a million other lag measures? Not to mention there’s a separate market for “futures”. What an incredibly shallow explanation masquerading as knowledge.
3047 2018-01-20 01:30:53 $200 trillion in #stocks #cash #bonds #gold around the world ... all 4 overvalued. If 2% of that ends up in #crypto you have a $4 trillion total market cap; 7X where we are today. If $BTC #bitcoin holds its current market share ... that would put the price at $80,000.

3067 2018-01-20 01:20:19 Well, when CB’S are buying stocks with the money they print and every CB in the world wants higher asset prices and will do anything to achieve the magical 2% inflation metric.... why not leverage up?
3068 2018-01-20 01:20:09 This makes me so sad. So many people needlessly dying from opiods. Our local newspaper has multiple articles per week on this issue. One library in Philly stocks Narcan to deal with ODs that occur regularly outside their door. And, we are talking about a darn wall.

3072 2018-01-20 01:15:37 Nice Jon. A common sense approach that the broad public can access for growing and protecting their assets in stocks/bonds/commodities/cash etc. Logical, and profitable, over time. Do you use hard, limit stops? i.e. pre set or do you enter them as they get triggered?

That's almost worse than not getting back anything at all, bc it's basically just confirmation that someone made off with your shit, as opposed to you just not getting the gun back.

3089 2018-01-20 01:05:29 Yes and this is consistent with Debondt and Thaler (1985) who show that stocks that perform well over a period of time ( 3 to 5 yrs) tend to underperform and vice versa for the same period.

3091 2018-01-20 01:03:17 Hi Tony   The reason is selling is that the level of world stocks outside of the US is much tighter than projected by USDA or estimated by many in the trade. In addition global consumption is higher than est as well.  Then we have the invert, basis levels even on US HG is cheap.
3092 2018-01-20 01:02:19 yeah, he makes me wonder what happened

he was advocating penny stocks before, now he's advocating altcoins, the crypto equivalent
3093 2018-01-20 01:02:04 "Stocks have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau." - Irving Fisher, Professor of Economics, Yale University, 1929.
3094 2018-01-20 01:01:21 Earnings news could help boost stocks in the coming week, but a bigger story may be the move higher in bond yields.
3095 2018-01-20 01:00:55 If the disincentive is $$, rich ppl will always to/get what they want. So, how about, "married rich guys in limos w/their girlfriends get put in the stocks for 2 hours if they go south of 60th"?
3096 2018-01-20 01:00:13 Do you wait for sales to buy big-ticket items like TV sets? If so, you should apply the same philosophy to stocks. A market correction is the best time to buy quality companies. A good question to ask yourself: "Do I have some cash to take deploy if a pullback occurs?" #investing

3099 2018-01-20 00:57:42 Since Trump thinks the stocks are a sign of his reign, the stock market has rallied during Donald Trump’s presidency, with the S&P 500 up nearly 24% during Trump’s first year in office. But it did even better during President Obama’s first year, rising 35.3%. #fact

3101 2018-01-20 00:56:18 Here’s the tip of the day: don’t sexually harass women and you won’t have to sell your stocks to cover the $32 million in salary you lost.
3102 2018-01-20 00:54:57 In a utilitarian framing: these are ideas that seem to structurally cause harm, and we have to weigh that against the upsides. These are penny stocks in the much-vaunted "marketplace of ideas".
3103 2018-01-20 00:54:04 Do you remember Obama saying it was a great time to buy stocks on the day the market bottomed? He sent a message to his cronies to get in.
3104 2018-01-20 00:51:43 I still can't believe no one is interested in these top stocks it's like I'm trying to give away free money and no one wants it!! All you have to do is personally tweet me two hour free promo special, I usually charge for this you guys got till ten pm to inquire
3105 2018-01-20 00:48:58 BETTER BUY SOME ROPE STOCKS.  THERE IS GOING TO BE A SHORTAGE.
3106 2018-01-20 00:48:10 Plus the way a lot of us see it is, if stocks eventually sell off then the fed will backstop it. Which will kick the dollar in the teeth. So crypto wins just by doing nothing. Plus there’s no cost of carry or time decay on this ‘option’.

3110 2018-01-20 00:44:50 Once people are so confident in the stock market that even non-investors buy up stocks with their life savings, the fat cats sell. I think it will be foreign investment that pulls out this time. I hope not, but there's where its going IMHO.
3111 2018-01-20 00:43:50 But on the flip side, I know more people my age that own crypto than stocks. Even the people my age that don’t understand what’s going on are listening to advice from the people that do.
3112 2018-01-20 00:42:26 I think you proved my point. 37% either own stocks or benefit directly or directly from stocks. However, most of the profits and cash go directly to the 1%, That's why we have this enormous inequality in the United States. Moreover this is a similar patterns all over the West.
3113 2018-01-20 00:42:17 @ProMISinc Stock up 45% on 8.5 million shares and no news ?  #Stocks $ARFXF
3114 2018-01-20 00:41:18 Wow, I would have never expected you replying. Also I have never heard anyone rational to ever say that he was going to tank the stock market, he has increased the stocks of Macy's when Trump made a Twitter rampage about Macy not using Ivankas products anymore, that was funny
3115 2018-01-20 00:41:02 Hello ladies monday njd atng stocks maabot ha :) Tuesday i display nana nko sa cachebox
3116 2018-01-20 00:40:22 The Dow has soared from 19,827 to 26,071 as of Friday’s close, up 31.5 %. This is the Big Board’s best first-year performance for a president since FDR. This is splendid news for the 54% of Americans who own stocks, including everyone with a retirement account.
3117 2018-01-20 00:40:05 It was nice of you to like the top 5 EPS #stocks @TopStockRetweet $NVDA with a new high on Friday. Have a great weekend.
3118 2018-01-20 00:39:38 Not asking for a huge run up. However, other MJ stocks steady or slight increase. Odd that these three continue to decline.
3119 2018-01-20 00:39:12 Your post suggests all people who are against tax scam don’t own stocks... this is a loose correlation at best ... one without evidence.
3120 2018-01-20 00:38:35 Thanks for the tip - I'm long the pharma stocks first thing Monday
3121 2018-01-20 00:37:58 It is your job to provide the citation ... where is it...? plenty of people who think the tax overhaul is a scam, I would bet half of own stocks (like me)
3122 2018-01-20 00:37:44 you have stocks in shark gifs
3123 2018-01-20 00:37:15 Glad you liked the top 5 EPS #stocks @Linda_ST_PT $CORT with 4th straight New Highs. Have an outstanding weekend.
3124 2018-01-20 00:34:18 Seeing a lot of huge small/micro-cap movies...$SGRP, $FORD, $RMGN, many Chinese stocks. We all know this is risk/speculative appetite...do you find this bullish for the interim or a concern of bullish fervor runneth over in advance of a top?
3125 2018-01-20 00:32:35 I was discussing this topic today with one of my friends. All the casinos stocks were dirt cheap because people couldn’t afford to gamble. $WYNN was below $15 and today it almost $180
3126 2018-01-20 00:31:55 Why would I have bragged about them? I don't own stocks. That means nothing to me. Thanks for actually acknowledging that they were also high during his tenure though.
3127 2018-01-20 00:31:40 Wife: Our stocks are up but I’m worried it’s a bubble.

Me: Also, our lives end.

3133 2018-01-20 00:29:18 Now start studying stocks 
3134 2018-01-20 00:28:57 none of those are showing up on @Cryptopia_NZ ... Which exchange are they on or are those penny stocks from the stock market?
3135 2018-01-20 00:28:55 No I Think they are still the same .006 a share wich adds up fast when you are trading lower priced stocks with big share sizes! I would mch rather a per ticket stucture!

3137 2018-01-20 00:26:29 Stocks Need To Open Back Up ....
3138 2018-01-20 00:26:28 Equity prices are determined by central bank interventions. Some CBs directly buy stocks.
3139 2018-01-20 00:26:08 My stocks have risen to 25k
3140 2018-01-20 00:25:34 Wait a minute... Specs in wti now hold 540mmb and there's 410mmb of stocks in US while well econs are very positive as we begin TA season.. welp this is a unique one.
3141 2018-01-20 00:24:23 Tax cuts might have helped in the past. Today's economy no longer an industrial economy offering jobs to ordinary Americans without STEM training. Bulk of our work force will not benefit with tax cuts which will be reinvested by rich in stocks. Not jobs.

3144 2018-01-20 00:21:29 Past performance does not guarantee future returns, and cheap stocks are many times cheap for a good reason
3145 2018-01-20 00:21:17 I was watching the stocks on tv for a good 20 min cause i was eating my sandwich and didn’t feel like putting it down to grab the remote
3146 2018-01-20 00:21:14 So some republican women voters were asked today why they support Trump. All answered because their 401k and stocks are up. Didn’t care about anything else. Remember ladies “ what goes up also goes down”. Stock markets do & have crashed
3147 2018-01-20 00:20:05 Yes, they are and people who have made money on their stocks are splurging after having to be cautious the last decade due to a weak GDP and stagnant stock mkt. open a Vanguard acct and take advantage of EVEN if you hate Trump!
3148 2018-01-20 00:19:49 well to be honest that can be said about a majority of the stocks you see being thrown around on twitter this week was considerably more obvious
3149 2018-01-20 00:19:19 U just trade dynamic of price action. All based on chart levels and tape. Sometimes we use bollinger bands for that but as a guide only. Stocks can run way past all indicators
3150 2018-01-20 00:19:01 Go out for drinks with your friends & invest/talks stocks & turning up lmfao I love my friends a lot
3151 2018-01-20 00:18:59 Here’s the Tip of the Day: put stops on all your stocks. Lock in profits.
3152 2018-01-20 00:18:42 Most lithium stocks have pulled back to their support levels and look set to go sideways for a few weeks. Sitting on about 50-60% cash atm so I'm ready to jump on when the next move eventuates. #ASX #ausbiz $XJO #Lithium
3153 2018-01-20 00:18:34 Everyone with all the stocks they dont have. What a pile of shit. And Jimmy Barnes hates Cory BAHAHAHAHAHAHA

3156 2018-01-20 00:16:09 COB cobinhood. Zero fee exchange. Still new. Smooth and neat platform. More coin listed every week. Cloning of robinhood the zero fee stocks exchange. Apps are amazing. Lot of potential of growth.
3157 2018-01-20 00:15:52 Quote this with good book(s). I need to go back to reading. I’m cool with topics like investing/stocks, humor, motivation, lifestyle and etc.
3158 2018-01-20 00:15:21 But let's keep Bump Stocks around, because the NRA and Russia have Americas interest in their hearts. #TrumpShutdown
3159 2018-01-20 00:13:17 Dear god, rich people are stupid. If your 401K and stocks are working overtime that would be thanks to Obama not Trump.
3160 2018-01-20 00:10:40 When the world saw stocks reach heights w/ economies in trouble, they now face the daunting task of setting new heights, when already at records & the economies have strengthened world-wide. 

Are they even correlated?
3161 2018-01-20 00:09:19 My 401K and other stocks have been doing overtime. Thanks to @realDonaldTrump for making a difference.  GOD IS BLESSING America!
3162 2018-01-20 00:08:12 Meanwhile, dollar is in a rapid descent. There are good reasons and good features to a dollar decline. But moving in inverse lock-step with stocks is beginning to worry me.
3163 2018-01-20 00:07:32 @AlbeeBaby you guys have so many out of stocks! on the mattresses, naturpedic basically gone. a lot of swaddle designs out of stock. How often do you refresh inventory? Should I buy elsewhere?
3164 2018-01-20 00:07:10 At midday MBS flat. Stocks mixed. 10-yr yield 2.62%.
3165 2018-01-20 00:05:52 Dems can’t fight stocks
3166 2018-01-20 00:05:49 Dd on penny stocks is as waste of time most of the time, follow the volume and the rumours.  These aren’t blue chip companies, 9 out of 10 never leave the ground but there is money to be made every day.
3167 2018-01-20 00:05:15 Obvs, money themed table decorations. You could do cash, stocks, Bitcoin ...
3168 2018-01-20 00:05:11 The country would have done just as well had Republicans chosen any one of the other candidates that ran. Although they may not have won. Obama left the country in good shape stocks and jobs where rising for 7 yrs prior. Trump deserves only slight credit on those.
3169 2018-01-20 00:03:13 If ur interested in stocks but uncomfortable risking ur money "best brokers" is a good app to help you get started and gain experience without breaking your pocket  
3170 2018-01-20 00:02:43 By any rational metric, @POTUS is doing a phenomenal job. Stocks up, jobs back, ME calming down, North & South Korea cooperating. The man is a genius...a very healthy #StableGenius . Now, #ReleaseTheMemo
3171 2018-01-19 23:58:39 Hahahahah he has been out of office for a year .. oh and dont forget when they left thought they had something on PRESIDENT TRUMP.. STOCKS WENT DOWN .. AND THEN THEY FAKE NEWS HAD TO  APOLOGIZE .. AND IT WENT SKY HIGH . THEN EVER BEFORE IN HISTORY
3172 2018-01-19 23:55:46 Already part of the thread, but again: 1) registry 2) universal background checks 3) ban on semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks, unless a safety course that involves mental eval 4) if on no fly list can't own guns, 5) PTSD counseling for all vets (Trump did this and is good).
3173 2018-01-19 23:55:37 and a lot of those 30% are just a few stocks in a retirement fund they don't even know they have

3177 2018-01-19 23:51:55 Very nice graph, but also somewhat treacherous: I'd argue that this relative depiction obscures the fact that both stocks and bonds are even more egregiously overvalued than in 2000 - setting both of them up for losses during the next dislocation.

3214 2018-01-19 23:34:11 Yeah. I was at PNC today and am going to get in on that Roth IRA deal, and possibly mutual funds. But a part of me still wants to try my luck at stocks. If I can get 5 shares vs 500 of a stable company, great.
3215 2018-01-19 23:32:54 Agree - confidence, speculation and tax changes have been helping him. But no president has the ability to control the markets in any big way. Stocks are overpriced right now more than they were in 1987. We're due for a correction. It'll be interesting to see how they spin it.
3216 2018-01-19 23:32:06 never short low float stocks, might make couple hundreds quick but lose 5 digits quick as well. hope we all learn this well... GL

3230 2018-01-19 23:19:08 Most of us don’t have a small business or stocks. Also most of the money that was given away as “disposable income” went to corporations. Are they coming into your business and buying stuff?

3234 2018-01-19 23:17:54 @jimcramer if we get an announcement of infrastructure increase coming. What stocks to look for ahead of the market.
3235 2018-01-19 23:15:57 DJIA is 30 stocks. Better to compare VTI to VEU. 1st time in years, rest of world kicked US butt (21.21 vs 27.37) w/o large tax cut. Hmmm.

3239 2018-01-19 23:13:39 good thing the average households own stocks....oh wait...they don't. they deposit what little money they have in accounts that accrue virtually no interest.
3240 2018-01-19 23:13:30 Penny stocks that cost $1 or more? No thanks. I want the ones that cost literal pennies. I'm talking 5 cents.

3250 2018-01-19 23:07:00 Do you own corporations, large amount of stocks, make more thank 150k/yr, own pass though companies, or are you worth more than $11 million? Because if you are an average American like me, you will get a fraction of what these people (%10 of Americans) will.
3251 2018-01-19 23:06:13 u dont need $50k to invest in the stock market,  u can put money into a roth ira for $50/m or invest in the the stock market through a company like @EdwardJones.  I purchases stocks thru them at $200 a month, you can do it for less, because we cant buy it in a block we pay more

3254 2018-01-19 23:05:04 Coins my guy, coins. Shares are for stocks.
3255 2018-01-19 23:03:26 Let's hear from all the brain dead trumpers about their 401K's that languished when stocks went up from 6500 to nearly 20,000 but now miraculously have risen bigly since trump came into office.  I'm sure the folks working 3 jobs to make ends meet are thrilled too.

3260 2018-01-19 23:01:46 @Sarge986 do you think $GE will eventually be replaced as a Dow component. The powers that be have a way of replacing low priced stocks in the DJ
3261 2018-01-19 23:01:19 Do u think it will impact stocks quickly to the downside?
3262 2018-01-19 23:01:01 I remember when traders used to argue with me when they were bullish on GoPro. Haha! Morons really thought entering the drone biz would be great for the company. Some people just aren't made for trading, investing. #Stocks
3263 2018-01-19 23:00:50 If you’re an equity investor, you might soon be obliged to enter the cryptocurrency world. When compared to equity markets, the relative outperformance of the top coins in 2017 was astronomical. #Investing #Stocks

3269 2018-01-19 22:55:29 In the world of stocks, #netflix is about to report record numbers of new subscribers, on the other hand they're spending 9 billion on original content, 90% of which flotsam and jetsam. The original content gamble may have jumped the shark
3270 2018-01-19 22:54:55 As an expert, I think this would make both stocks and bonds higher. That’s good.
3271 2018-01-19 22:54:24 These guys “make” money from stocks and insider trading so taking away their pay is bogus and showmanship.
3272 2018-01-19 22:54:19 If you're @AlabamaFTBL isn't recruiting boring? Welp...got another 4 . Oh gee we landed a 5 . Wonder what my stocks are doing?
3273 2018-01-19 22:54:01 been thinking about getting rich buying stocks myself
3274 2018-01-19 22:53:14 And the GOP Congress did not ban bump stocks.
3275 2018-01-19 22:50:30 Elon Musk's SpaceX valuation is $25B. Twitter's valuation is $16B. But Ripple's marketcap is fucking $60B. Even if you sell SpaceX and Twitter, you won't be able to buy the whole marketcap of Ripple. This is how crypto works. Totally different from traditional stocks calculation.
3276 2018-01-19 22:50:28 Yes you will be fool to put all your money in stocks especially since 2008
3277 2018-01-19 22:49:47 When the stocks increase rapidly it puts pressure on competitive investments to move assets to the stock market because that is where the action is. Which leads to more bubble. We need productivity and that is only thing that can grow an economy. Not printed money.
3278 2018-01-19 22:49:44 Do you think gold stocks will be a safe haven? I think gold initially rallied in '87 but then crashed, but then rebounded gain. Might be wrong...

3281 2018-01-19 22:46:12 I HEAR THE STOCKS WILL RISE THIS IS

3286 2018-01-19 22:43:28 All right.I will add more IDDR on Monday .I bought some today and buy some more.and of course I am going to do DD on stocks you mentioned.
3287 2018-01-19 22:43:11 When you started on Suretrader with your 2k account, were the stocks running restricted/HTB or did you focus on the ones no one was looking at? Sometimes stuff runs but then a week later its still restricted when i see you guys shorting it and banking.
3288 2018-01-19 22:42:39 NP, all good.
3289 2018-01-19 22:42:35 govt shuts down, it's on  you.  As vicente fox said, you won't be president, there won't be a govt.           stocks will crash, you and your greedy friends will buy up a bunch and then they'll go back up.  is that the plan?  a stock crash for $. all abt racism and $ to you.
3290 2018-01-19 22:41:44 Not sure if Fox realizes the stocks in the DOW change over time and it is a very dumb way to track economy.  Better way is BLS Inflation Calculator.  Keep in mind democrats, republicans support chained CPI to steal from people.

3301 2018-01-19 22:35:00 Interesting that people buy stocks awaiting news coming out.  This is new to me. Twitter news causing a one day spike in price and volume.  Only to see the stocks decrease in price over the following days.

3312 2018-01-19 22:30:11 Seriously now tho, it's like every other market. Like stocks. You buy something and it might go up and down due to news/speculation/use cases, etc. Then you can sell for a profit/loss or use it directly for something depending on the coin.

3316 2018-01-19 22:27:08 Also, I wonder what results a monkey would come up with vs. a scout, like the monkeys picking random stocks.
3317 2018-01-19 22:26:19 You also know that stocks and your 401k set many records under the last President..inheritating a much worse situation than Orange did
3318 2018-01-19 22:25:53 Increased $GE to 5% of single stocks. Cash is down to 12% of assets.

I didn’t buy any stock but company stock (discounted!) until I felt like I had enough cushion to try it. Then I got stocks of companies I liked in $2000 increments during recession.
3320 2018-01-19 22:21:45 Serious crime here - something must be done about this @ServoWealth and @CastleviewAdvsr !  46% of Americans have no money invested in

equity funds, or  inside a pre‐tax

3322 2018-01-19 22:20:54 In current market environment, knowing #FANG stocks is not enough. One needs new stocks that haven't yet become common hot names. We tweeted some of the top hedge funds recently. Following them closely may give you an edge to spot winners ahead of the crowd.
3323 2018-01-19 22:20:41 Never noticed you were gone...more noise from the left...how are your stocks doing...
3324 2018-01-19 22:20:02 People make poor economic choices. They don’t save enough for retirement. They refuse to cut their losses on plummeting stocks because they won’t own up to mistakes. They buy houses and other investments when prices are high, thinking that what’s going up today will keep going up
3325 2018-01-19 22:19:48 no gov't, no president, the stocks will fall,  his pals  will  buy them  up cheap,  he'll  do somex to get them to rise, the phuckers all mk a bunch of $.

3329 2018-01-19 22:16:37 How is it a speculative number, valuations are very complicated and detailed. I bet youve never tried actually learning about stocks or the economy. Speculation is a tiny part of it. Yes its a scam but you or anyone can take advantage of it. Many many investment vehicles
3330 2018-01-19 22:16:23 My advice is hold this 1, take profit as U will (at tops)l, but keep a nice size position "long", as an actual investment-even if 1/4 of ur shares, whatever! I know the word "investment" is taboo in OTC, but read the 8k. Stocks r always a risk, but hav 2B in it 2 win it!  $DCAC

3349 2018-01-19 22:02:22 To help reduce risk, put 10-15% in international funds & 20-25% in BOND funds. Bonds are there as a check on losses more than for great growth. They do well when stocks don’t.

Second, income inequality is at all time high. While the top 1% enjoys doubt pre-recession levels, that doesn’t apply to majority of Americans, whom make an annual average of bit over $30k
3360 2018-01-19 21:58:21 The paragraph YOU highlighted said ATF believes bump-stocks are legal, the PROPER reading of THE LAW at that time. Then you said "Obama Admin ATF" didn't receive enough pressure "to change their ruling"; how could they legitimately do that if only Congress can re-write laws?  1/2

3371 2018-01-19 21:53:34 Im a staunch supporter of the 2nd but have major issues with bump stocks, IMO theyre nothing more than a loop hole.

3373 2018-01-19 21:48:24 Look at a long term bond yield graph. Each spike higher was met with a crisis of sorts. Each crisis occurs at lower highs. Currently, i doubt the economy or stocks could withstand 100bps higher on Tens from here.

3387 2018-01-19 21:35:58 Fascinating to see that gold went down, while the stocks are going up. Gold touched his bottom, slowly moving up and starting a new cycle. Instead, the NASDAQ stocks are about to hit their max this year/next year and will go down, then gold will run big time.
3388 2018-01-19 21:35:05 Nah, to go from one to the other over a six gear period. I moved from property Into cypto in 2017. I expect a slow move I to silver this year and then hopefully into nz stocks. When I'm done.... im buying enough land to retire.

3445 2018-01-19 21:11:35 The point of that paragraph is gun laws are flawed & ATF *wasn't in the position to outlaw bump-stocks* (i.e., no authority to do so b/c bump-stocks aren't regulated as a firearm under the GCA or NFA).

Ryan knows very well ATF can't do anything here & wants it that way.

3474 2018-01-19 20:53:10 @JeffClarktrader The BB signal that you describe for VIX - does that work for stocks too? If the stock trades below lower BB and then closes inside, is it likely to trade higher? Looking at SYMC setup.

3506 2018-01-19 20:41:49 One of those "stocks" where you look at how much cash they have and you realize that it's less than what you have in your account. I really hate stocks with tiny moneyflow.

3534 2018-01-19 20:23:31 That's right. This type of volume is impossible locally. This is not normal CDN level volume on these stocks. That -alone- should give people a clue that these are not normal traders. Plus the names: look up Instinet.
3535 2018-01-19 20:23:31 Every...single..trade..is a taxable event.  Exactly the same as if you were buying and selling stocks.

The difference is, when you buy/sell stocks, the exchange sends both you and the IRS a convenient 1099 form at the end of the year.

With crypto, you track that yourself.

3578 2018-01-19 19:55:28 I think when people theatrically proclaim that they are “robbing a generation of savers” it’s maybe directed at people who don’t have sufficient $ to invest in stocks/bonds and quite possibly rely heavily on banks (CDs) for their savings.

3605 2018-01-19 19:44:45 The USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) Friday said it would provide $6 million to support genomics-based research aimed at improving the use of biomass and plant feed stocks used to produce ethanol and renewable chemical feedstocks.
3606 2018-01-19 19:44:12 Also should be considered there's 3 different bills in the Senate addressing bump stocks that have been rolled into SB1, which is now in front of the Finance Committee (?) after an 11Y-4N in Courts of Justice. They have to "seem" on board.
3607 2018-01-19 19:44:11 Ahhhh...about 20 years ago...futures, forex, stocks, options, on and off. But, the last 5 years it has been almost on a daily basis. Throughout that time @AjAwesomecalls has been the most complete and REAL trading info I have ever been a part of. Nothing will top it.
3608 2018-01-19 19:43:58 Actually, you can blame the democrats for this... Bump stocks was approve for sale to the general public in 2010 by the Obama Admin ATF... For 6 years, Obama and the Democrats did nothing! Not any pressure on ATF to change their ruling or any legislation to fix it!

3619 2018-01-19 19:39:55 Just think of it as "deporting" the bump stocks and you'll be OK with it.
3620 2018-01-19 19:38:35 LOL!  Stocks at record highs, unemployment at lows, tax cuts for 90% of people, tons of biz handing out bonuses and repatriating earning to USA... sure his approval is low just like HC had 98% chance of winning.  95% of media trying a coup is why as low as is.
3621 2018-01-19 19:38:26 I dont think bumpstocks are needed but, they dont even have a good system of confiscating weapons from convicted felons.... no cop is going to knock on doors to "collect" stocks. 

Let's focus on getting guns out of the hands of those with no legal right to have them.
3622 2018-01-19 19:36:20 Doesn't have to be stocks, BP 15 sigma move off Brexit could have paid for a lot of olive trees.

3625 2018-01-19 19:34:55 $SX - Never seen anything like this. If its a pump and dump, it has some serious players involved. The volume is insane. Pump and dumps don't get this kind of volume.  Traditional pump and dumps are on highly illiquid stocks... Today the volume will equal the share count..
3626 2018-01-19 19:34:44 I bought some stocks the morning after the election right after I heard you said the market might never recover so... what do you think the market will do this year. I want to"short" Paul Krugman again.

3632 2018-01-19 19:31:21 We hear alot about a given draft's strengths (college hitters, prep RHPs, etc), but what is the weakness of the 2018 draft class and what players could see their draft stocks increase/picked earlier than they probably should because they are in an area of positional scarcity?

3646 2018-01-19 19:22:04 I think I might get back to buying US stocks again. I might sit down this weekend and come up with an investing strategy. This seems like a really good stock to own.
3647 2018-01-19 19:21:40 I was waiting outside of stocks and was planning on getting in now with the ceiling debacle but wandering do emotions take a big hit on stocks to the downside? Maybe wait until end of March?
3648 2018-01-19 19:21:27 Health care stocks are slightly higher, including a nearly 0.2% gain for the NYSE Health Care Index in recent trading Friday.

And how's your stocks?

Hmmm
Thought so.
3656 2018-01-19 19:16:26 Without registration, how would anyone know where these stocks are?
3657 2018-01-19 19:16:22 Shall I tell you the truth.I am into penny stocks first time.I am little nervous but who knows this is what I wanted.Thanks to you and TSL for getting me into penny stocks.
3658 2018-01-19 19:16:10 @GuyAdami The comments by MorganStanley's CIO on CNBC's HalftimeReport WERE V/IMPORTANT but get dismissed by permabulls. He said he "sees this phase as "euphoria" & sees it from his entire base of financial advisors whose clients just want to buy stocks." Just don't be too long
3659 2018-01-19 19:15:56 They just can't lose. The employment data (probably the most phony of all), inflation, dollar index, stocks. Any data point that would convince the average person that something is wrong, is covered.   And the years keep ticking by...

3663 2018-01-19 19:14:53 Stocks did better in Obama’s first year than in Trump’s //Another column full of BS. Trump borrowed nothing and the Market went up $6 Trillion in one year. Obama borrowed $10 Trillion by selling bonds to China which will someday come back to ruin the US economy.
3664 2018-01-19 19:14:52 "occupancy" lol. Obama won the popular vote both times, I know that's a sore spot for you. & seriously dude, if your investments were stagnant for most of one of best bull markets of all time, stop whining abt Obama, it's on your manager not investing better. My stocks did great
3665 2018-01-19 19:13:04 And STILL no Congressional/presidential action on bump stocks, high capacity mags
or high volumes of ammunition purchases.

3673 2018-01-19 19:09:14 You seem to be more optimistic the me about preventive steps being taken if we knew his motives. Hard to see that much changed for non-terror related mass murders. Bump stocks still being unregulated as only one example.
3674 2018-01-19 19:08:58 Stocks did better in Obama’s first year than in Trump’s ///How many Trillions in bonds were sold by the FED to bail out the Banks. Treasury printing money is how stocks did better,10 Trillion in the hole better.

3677 2018-01-19 19:07:47 I dont know Rich or Dan, but Dan called Rich out on his lame analysis to prove stocks over Bitcoin and all Rich could do was throw Dan's track record in his face rather than discuss the facts. If anyone uses Rich's analysis for making decisions then they are idiots.

3680 2018-01-19 19:04:48 Stocks generally, yeah, but Trump has definitely weaponised his Twitter account to wipe value off the share price of companies that spoke against him.

3692 2018-01-19 18:59:11 Have patience, most pot stocks are in consolidation mode
3693 2018-01-19 18:59:10 lol try the other definition (the one we were actually discussing): "investment in stocks, property, or other ventures in the hope of gain but with the risk of loss." Investing in the Dutch East Indies Company = speculation
3694 2018-01-19 18:59:07 yes thats true.. memons ka reference stocks aur corporate finance k sectors k hisaab say i meant.. baqi you are right bohat diversity hai otherwise..
3695 2018-01-19 18:58:44 and you restrict margin on every single one of them. traders want to trade stocks that move but you limit margin of anything with volume and range..
3696 2018-01-19 18:58:43 Bullshit the stocks have NEVER been this high  Yet all you liberals said it would crash if he won smh.
3697 2018-01-19 18:58:16 $SGDH Look at the previous times this has run and volumes started to die out, like March '17. Also look at whats happening with weed stocks in general, volume drying out. Maybe/hopefully congress checks Jeff Sessions but odds are that doesn't happen fast.

3713 2018-01-19 18:46:12 No stop loss or trailing stop loss... Not booking profits time to time, not getting out of bad stocks... being greedy n expecting more upside in stocks that are giving profits... Happened to me around 2007/2010... Again, Now just started leaening out of curiosity... Haha hhaa...
3714 2018-01-19 18:45:55 Honestly these stocks don't need any bashing to correct what was an overbought situation. Wasn't that hard to see.

3716 2018-01-19 18:45:24 Stocks up, unemployment down, Apple repatriating and hiring, better standing in world, etc. come out from your safe space and live in real world.
3717 2018-01-19 18:45:15 @bkfViking123 why do I see some huge insider buys in stocks, then later they dilute themselves. Example TNDM. Insiders bought at 3.50. Then diluted again recently...
3718 2018-01-19 18:45:08 Pero eso es lo que quieren desarmar los programas nacionales y que las provincias se hagan cargo. Lemus parecía un inútil subejecutando todo, pero cumplió muy bien su cometido bajar el presupuesto y el "gasto" Usaron stocks de licitaciones del gobierno anterior.

3734 2018-01-19 18:32:08 It’s not the law-abiding ppl of whom they’re speaking. Law-abiding ppl don’t buy assault rifles & bump stocks. Violence most often begets violence, so convince us how owning automatic (war) weapons is simply for civilian protection. It’s for a paramilitary. What’s next, grenades?

3740 2018-01-19 18:28:58 You were nearly giddy during the 2013 shutdown. The one where you said that the president is where, ultimately, blame lies for shutdowns. “Stocks rose yesterday during the first day of government shutdown. Markets like being left alone for a day."-Donald J. Trump
3741 2018-01-19 18:27:59 Christey swerved on issues like a drink on a curvy road. He banned bump stocks...good...now what the heck does he mean by  " a friendly whatever " specifics please.
3742 2018-01-19 18:27:51 Oil stocks are valued based on “proven reserves”. In order to show growth in stock value, oil companies must continually increase their proven reserves while at the same time reducing these reserves through production. This is why they push for access to the offshore assets

3753 2018-01-19 18:20:02 The stock market (if you know the least about stocks) has more to do with Obama than it has to Trump, the fact that @realDonaldTrump tries to take advantage and credit for everything good that happens is pathetic, just like he took credit for no air traffic accidents. lol

3769 2018-01-19 18:12:35 80% of stocks are owned by top 10%. Half of Americans do not have 401k or pension. Plus companies inflate their stock #s with stock buybacks.  It's a boon that half the country doesn't benefit from and mainly 10% benefit from. So not a good indicator of a healthy economy.
3770 2018-01-19 18:12:06 Also, unemployment at 18 year low.  Black and Hispanic unemployment the lowest ever measured (such a racist!).  Women unemployment at an 18 year low.  Wages growing for the first time in 10 years.  Over 3% growth.  Stock market up faster than ever (and 80% own stocks).  Awful...
3771 2018-01-19 18:09:33 You are so inept even Fox doesn’t want you. Sad.

3789 2018-01-19 17:58:28 London stocks were boosted on Friday by weakness in the pound, which slipped following the release of disappointing retail data that added to the sector's woes alongside a profit warning from Carpetright.
3790 2018-01-19 17:58:17 Hahaha incorrect. They are not and will not be liable. Keep crying. Go trade stocks and leave the crypto to the real winners
3791 2018-01-19 17:56:20 That's just a % chance and the supply amount may have diminished enough since 8.2k so that we see now what we expect at 8.2k. Horizontal stuff works well enough in stocks and established markets but here we have adoption underneath it all. Hence I'm willing to say 10k instead.
3792 2018-01-19 17:54:39 @MadMoneyOnCNBC The comments by MorganStan's CIO on CNBC's HalftimeReport WERE VERY IMPORTANT but get dismissed by permabulls.

Foolish mortals lol
3804 2018-01-19 17:46:31 #cheapmomostocks vs. $FB similar stocks with high price tags the main difference is I can only buy a few thousand shares of FB while I can buy tens of thousands shares of cheapies... I can just keep add add add until I get it right!  
3805 2018-01-19 17:45:51 To somehow compartmentalize a potential financial pop in stocks, housing etc. as strictly a Trump issue is far from intellectually honest.

3808 2018-01-19 17:43:58 >Implying market cap in stocks means that there is that amount of money invested.
Using this kind of thinking everything is a ponzi scheme since not everyone can sell all their apple stocks at market price or withraw their money from banks for example...
3809 2018-01-19 17:42:47 Yeah. That's how stocks and buying into things work. It's a dip. These things happens. Many believe it will rise again.

3815 2018-01-19 17:39:57 yes all strategists agree that euphoria usually continues BUT there are dips and volatility since it starts AND what if the retail investor is smarter this time since institutional buyers are slowing up on pushing stocks higher...
3816 2018-01-19 17:39:50 International Grains Council, @IGCgrains; Together with a larger figure for carry-ins, the overall increase in global #rice #supplies is channelled to higher consumption, mainly in Africa, and ending stocks, which are placed at 123m t, down by 1% y/y
3817 2018-01-19 17:39:19 Why is trump talking unemployment, stocks, and obviously himself at a right to life event? Can't he just stay on topic? And if he really cares about "LIFE" then he could sign Dems DACA into law! It is lives we are speaking of!
3818 2018-01-19 17:39:17 Sure, but Trump didn't DO anything. There is NOTHING, no executive, no legislative document that had a single cause and effect that generated excess demand to buys stocks.
3819 2018-01-19 17:38:25 Appreciation of my body.
And putting money in stocks, lol
3820 2018-01-19 17:38:11 International Grains Council, @IGCgrains; Due to a reduced figure for opening stocks and with consumption unchanged from before, global #soyabean #inventories are cut slightly, to 40m t
3821 2018-01-19 17:38:08 It's been a challenging week on the markets with fairly slow volume across the board. However, when you pick stocks that are backed by solid fundamentals and a strong BOD, yet are trading at lows, you can't really lose. Choose wisely and always DYOR. Enjoy the weekend!

3825 2018-01-19 17:36:29 It's fascinating how Trump has been able to set the media narrative on this. The stock market rose consistently during Obama's term as we climbed out of the recession, but I don't remember stories titled "Obama's big year for stocks". Will have to go back and check headlines.
3826 2018-01-19 17:36:28 Don't get mad because more and more people are on Presendent Trump side. Unemployment is Dow and the stocks are up. Your the idiot who is still crying. Go find a safe space Snowflakes are cry babies.
3827 2018-01-19 17:36:20 The comments by Morgan Stan's CIO on CNBC's HalftimeReport WERE VERY IMPORTANT but get dismissed by permabulls. He said he "sees this phase as "euphoria" & sees it from his entire base of financial advisors whose clients just want to buy stocks." Don't be too long??

3840 2018-01-19 17:32:31 The Dow being in good shape is not a direct sign that the economy is in good shape. It just might mean people are bailing on their stocks to get the hell out of the way of the coming storm.

3860 2018-01-19 17:23:46 Mr. President, please put a stop to the ATF proposed rule change banning bump stocks, 1) the way it is written is way overly broad, 2) bump stocks don't fall under the definition of machine gun. 3) future admins could use this as a gun ban. @MAC_Arms
3861 2018-01-19 17:23:32 Rich Ross at @CNBCFastMoney says you could've doubled your money in two years with Boeing stocks. That's great! You could've 10x'd your money in six months with Bitcoin last year. Yes it's volatile, but that volatility brings so much opportunity.

3865 2018-01-19 17:22:50 Yes, ~3 million 1%ers here, who own ⅜ of USA’s $30Trillion of stocks…$4mm each. The next 60 mm people have $200K each, enough for modest expenses over 8 years’ retirement.

250 million Americans—⅘ of us—have less than $25K. That’s median income…for 6 months

Just quit college to be a stock operator. Thanks

3985 2018-01-19 16:32:22 Same investment advisor posted: ‘Along with it has been the most "I've never had so much money" calls those have tended to be from the long time aerospace peeps that have Boeing, Lockheed etc stocks’

3992 2018-01-19 16:31:04 Surprised stocks aren't rallying thousands of points on the prospect of a long-term government shutdown...
3993 2018-01-19 16:31:02 For example service like equity master ate more concerned on inventing new services every month and pushing it down your throat but they provide a detailed research into the stock recommended which I use to filter the stocks
3994 2018-01-19 16:30:58 Nothing like a good $VIX slam to get stocks cooking!  (cough cough ... thanks Fed).  We could use a crypto VIX so some whale could slam it down and drive my coins higher.  #BTC #LTC #ETH
3995 2018-01-19 16:30:58 $DIGX .0005s started. Those that were looking to buy "just-in-time" for the next pre-PR / Q run will be getting in at .0005/6 over the coming hours & days. Longs secured the bulk of the .0003s/.0004s hence the lack of mass flipping seen on most stocks in this price range.
3996 2018-01-19 16:30:53 Metals Stocks: Gold bounces higher on risk of U.S. government shutdown
3997 2018-01-19 16:30:06 $ORCL $MSFT Oracle is at 10.6x ‘18E EBITDA vs Microsoft at 15.0x. Oracle should be at the same multiple, at least. 40% upside. #stocks

4001 2018-01-19 16:27:48 One more thing, despite my subscription I do not blindly invest in them, I do my own research and I use these as a base to filter quality stocks,  I use my own research before entering such things helped me to enter at lower price in few stocks suggested
4002 2018-01-19 16:27:47 With no debate, House Rules referring the bills banning bump stocks to Militia, Police and Public Safety Committee where they would normally go. Not killing them as some feared

4012 2018-01-19 16:24:27 Surprised, Sean? If u plan 2cut and then cut corporate taxes, expected profits will increase pushing stocks up? Now they will probably go down in the year or 2 when there is no further "tax stimulus" b/c their P/E ratio will probably return 2normal after the tax cut is priced in.
4013 2018-01-19 16:24:05 Haha, I wouldn’t want to spend too long in the stocks!  It’s been a lovely day. We just stopped for cake in a lovely tea room which has the most amazing handmade chocolates xx

4036 2018-01-19 16:14:25 One hypothesis:
There is a perceived risk holding stocks, overnight and on weekends, especially ones reporting earnings after the close.
More often than not, the earnings surprise positive, so when the market opens there are more buy orders than sell orders.
4037 2018-01-19 16:13:33 Back home from a little vacation in Egypt . Thanks for everyone who asked. I will do my job this weekend and try to find some good stocks to share with you. Take care everyone and enjoy the weekend

4039 2018-01-19 16:11:41 It’s like something that inflates and depreciates at a much more rapid rate than physical money and acts almost as stocks at this point. It’s money that is exclusively used online and generally untraceable so has been used in blackmarket areas like on the dark web

4067 2018-01-19 16:00:52 Yes rising rates -> stronger economy -> bullish for stocks.

4116 2018-01-19 15:42:10 Heavy marketing day trader bragging about $28k profits on an options play on a stock that was up 0.4%? I call BS and even if true just shows his sheep were the source. Didn't mention losing on most of his recent stock plays even with the sheep pumps. #DayTrading scammers. #Stocks

4118 2018-01-19 15:41:54 The "information didn't come out".  It was front page news 8 years ago. ... and we were NEVER "charged" with pumping stocks. We only created discussion and raised awareness of material facts. Hence why we're not in jail and still in business.

4125 2018-01-19 15:39:29 Agreed! The total lack of understanding of the fractional and non-splitting(!) nature of crypto compared to stocks, is IMO largely facilitating the "OMG it's a bubble!!" narrative. Still tons of learning to be done by the people on the traditional finance side of things.
4126 2018-01-19 15:39:23 What do you think about this opinion that real money is made by staying with stocks across cycles of under valuation and over valuation?
4127 2018-01-19 15:39:09 Heightened correlations between everything normally precede collapse just as in 2007/08. Then markets morph into Risk ON/OFF when risk assets all fall together... diversification between stocks, bonds, real estate no longer exists.

4132 2018-01-19 15:37:19 So when you say "open up the NFA" what did that mean? I took it to mean you'd repeal it and not require stamps. 

I would agree that only dumbasses buy bump stocks, but making them illegal is stupid.
4133 2018-01-19 15:36:59 Sitting on our egos hurts both ways. We either don't sell overvalued stocks  drunk on our success. Or, think that stocks we buy won't fall.

4136 2018-01-19 15:35:52 Oil stocks bottomed, they will start to release earnings here in the next few weeks and most likely do very good. Most had good earnings when oil was at $40. Natgas stocks are what are under pressure, Lack of pipeline and AECO pricing hurting profits at these prices.

4151 2018-01-19 15:30:23 Why I expect the correction to sharp but brief to facilitate introduction of more extreme monetary measures. Remember, this market now has muscle memory in one direction only, UP. What do you think it will do if stocks just fall 2%, 3%, 5% in days? #Panic
4152 2018-01-19 15:30:12 You're obviously reading fake news. Since the inauguration of your Golden Toddler- In- Chief, the terror has mostly been white and domestic, aided by the congressional love of the NRA and refusal to do anything to slow the sale of bump stocks.

4184 2018-01-19 15:19:57 It's a side effect of typical assets like stocks in which one cannot buy 0.5 stocks or something like that, so people assume it's the same with cryptocurrency. We'll soon have a new generation though that will find strange the stock market works this way.

4250 2018-01-19 14:56:51 Yes. Stocks continue the climb that was well underway under President Obama. Trump gets to ride that wave, but wrongly claims credit for it. He's so pathetic. Unfortunately, Trump is doing possibly irreparable damage to other American institutions. History won't  remember kindly.

4305 2018-01-19 14:36:05 It all depends on your time horizon. If you need your money back on a short term basis, stocks are too risky, and yes, savers are “punished” by low interest rates. Also, some people unfortunately lack the sophistication necessary for purchasing and managing *investments*.

4309 2018-01-19 14:35:27 Yeah.  When Obama first announced it gold went up to right under $2k per ounce.  The deal with that is most the money went to the giant banks who then bought back stocks and padded salaries gave self bonuses.  Less than 7%went into actual company infrastructure like intended

4327 2018-01-19 14:29:48 It's tax season and it is the time of the year to look back on the money you made and wonder where did it all go??

The answer is student loans, at least half went to student loans.

4328 2018-01-19 14:29:15 noted before that $MSCI in top 20pct in ROIC and gross margin compared to large cap Technology stocks. ROIC not mean reverting

4377 2018-01-19 14:08:21 Replace velocity with growth rate and you have a good model for valuing growth stocks.
4378 2018-01-19 14:07:53 wasn't trying to get at anyone. if you look at my post history, i've always questioned $lg. #MJ stocks will be on a down trend for rest of month, with a few exceptional ones. IMO.
4379 2018-01-19 14:06:36 So true but every time there is a bull run people forget as they make the most out of these stocks.
4380 2018-01-19 14:05:55 Well that can’t be true otherwise Trump would be talking about what a terrible threat they are. Instead there’s total silence no laws on bump stocks nothing so since it was domestic terrorism they don’t talk about it.
4381 2018-01-19 14:05:26 So if the 10yr trades to 3% in 2018, you say stocks will drop?
4382 2018-01-19 14:05:07 Difficile à dire, cela dépend des stocks ;-)
4383 2018-01-19 14:05:00 .@OliJosefs I take most of my profits at 25 % from their pivot. That being said, if some of my holdings show unusual strength ($ANAB is one of them) I use 10DMA as my selling guide. I sell weaker stocks as soon as they violate 50DMA.

4396 2018-01-19 14:02:31 Here's why you need to buy more bank stocks: Over the last 2 rate hikes prime has gone up 50 bps; but so-called High Interest Savings accounts have gone up only 20 bps. That's huge extra margin on billions of bucks.

4411 2018-01-19 13:55:36 I mean that makes sense. I guess it’s just a matter of preference. I just think it’s a bit much when everyone says just stick to index funds when we’ve seen success in individual stocks. You don’t really have to be an expert to see that LMT, NFLX, or MSFT had good fundamentals.

4501 2018-01-19 12:54:19 Our stocks depend on the customers who trade their second-hand items into us.
4502 2018-01-19 12:53:52 The boomers didn’t save their whole lives even tho interest rates went down for 30 yrs and stocks skyrocketed. That’s why they are all still working. Boomers to Gitmo
4503 2018-01-19 12:53:37 For stocks bought in double digit prices :-)
4504 2018-01-19 12:53:00 see. this is why liberals are so dumb. they just think the president has to do social crap- immigration, equality stuff..things that only matter to mexicans and blacks.  liberals need to pay attention to things that matter, stocks, inflation, unemployment.
4505 2018-01-19 12:52:33 I thought it belongs to the NRA. After Vegas we still can’t do anything about bump stocks.

4512 2018-01-19 12:50:47 $ could come under pressure as there might be a lack of confidence in the GOP passing future bills but then again no one can know for sure.Stocks could be interesting. SP500 fell -4.4% in the shutdown of 1979. Back then one party controlled, the WH,Senate and the House, like now
4513 2018-01-19 12:50:47 whenever it happens where the stocks sell off hard the class action lawsuits will hit @cnbc and the passive etf funds for reckless recommendation/unbiased coverage on cnbc and reckless, thoughtless buying of the same stocks even though it's buyer beware.
4514 2018-01-19 12:50:32 Nothing specific as far as companies go. I add a group of stocks all within like $1-$20  to my watchlist and watch their trend before I determine whether or not I want to buy the stock
4515 2018-01-19 12:50:18 ...And when Trump declared that the #DXY ($USD) was "too high", that wasn't something he came up with on his own. Who's idea was it to destroy the dollar? The US Treasury. $USD down = stocks up. They're trying to create inflation.

4522 2018-01-19 12:45:43 There’s gotta be a way to #CoOp this buy (#CSB - Communities Supporting Breweries). Auctioneer says “north of $10 Million”. 120 ppl = $100,000 = $12 Mil; 240 ppl = $50,000 = $12 Mil, etc, etc. Change corporate structure, different class of stocks? 24,000 people x $500 = $12 Mil!
4523 2018-01-19 12:45:14 I used to spend a lot of time and stress picking stocks only to come out worse than if I went full on into the total market index. Individual stocks just weren't worth it for me so I stopped, and have done better as a result.

4532 2018-01-19 12:39:02 Apparently the kanji for "stocks" 株 can also mean "root vegetable", so theoretically, a company might contractually grant you some turnips.

4559 2018-01-19 12:21:32 Oops.  I left out the basis for these replies, which is that 401k's and 403b's typically consist of a selection from a set of mutual funds, company stock, and often other stocks and bonds. Most employees in the US who invest do so through employer sponsored plans.
4560 2018-01-19 12:21:18 You do realize that trade deals don’t export jobs overseas, right? The same mega-rich corporations that lobbied so hard to have their taxes and regulations decreased did, right?

4561 2018-01-19 12:19:51 I agree. My husband received his biggest bonus to date. They said the company (a small biotech in MA) exceeded expectations. My 401k is yielding 11.97%

4575 2018-01-19 12:11:40 He said this because they don't like it when old white men assemble an arsenal & kill 50-some people, bc then it highlights their culpability in refusing to change gun laws!

4592 2018-01-19 12:01:08 True, $2500 in cash is not the same as $2500 in stocks. BUT, if you look at the AAPL portfolio over the last year, they have been on an upward climb, meaning the stocks are worth MORE than $2500 when they decide to sell.

4633 2018-01-19 11:31:49 On a red day, it is important to stop concentrating too much on the p/f - this is AIM, stocks are volatile.

There something new coming up from @Tickermarket on the 17th Feb 2018. #Markets #Stocks #MVM #MVT #TickerMarket
4749 2018-01-19 09:47:34 I remember a year ago when I was wandering chadstone looking for short men’s overalls. The guy in Universal Store literally swore that they did not exist, so I went and found them (with ease) online at  @ASOS, and now they’re fkn everywhere and even universal stocks them 
4750 2018-01-19 09:46:51 US stocks could crash on Government shutdown , over valuations, Brexit, geo political risks from Iran and North korea
4751 2018-01-19 09:45:54 I usually stay away from stocks where whole Retail is in.
4752 2018-01-19 09:45:28 Some good profits but I think it's all the almost free money being injected into the economy over the last 8 years being used to buyback stocks and artificially inflate the market.  Plus lots of dark backroom trading and deals we never see.

4768 2018-01-19 09:30:40 The funny thing is that US stocks will ramp up once the government avoids shut down,"relief rally "it will be called, despite stocks never selling off in the first place. good for another 3% higher next week, simply because the government delayed shutdown for another 10 mths.

4773 2018-01-19 09:21:41 Way to frame question of how much politics/policy is moving stocks. That is what matters (to investors at least)

4778 2018-01-19 09:17:47 If you had invested all yr money  in HDFC BANK on 11Jan 2008, when stock markets crashed globally, you would have compounded your money @ 20% including dividends. So much for Value Investing and avoiding costly stocks.
4779 2018-01-19 09:17:24 This happens quite often, and the other way around also. Best solution is to have a portfolio with stocks from small/midcaps as well as sensex/nifty stocks.
4780 2018-01-19 09:16:48 Why forget that if you had invested all yr money  in HDFC BANK on 11Jan 2008, when index crashed, you would have compounded your money @ 20% including dividends? So much for Value Investing and avoiding costly stocks.

4841 2018-01-19 08:16:34 Though both are solid stocks and qualify for a long term hold, 30%-40% gains within 1 month are huuuuuge. 

If people continue to sit on such gains, and fall in love with the stocks, it is their loss. They should continue to hold and not get nervous after a dip in that case.

4872 2018-01-19 07:55:19 Wouldn't be surprised if they did in the past but don't now due to the potential issues and focus on that type of practice.

4874 2018-01-19 07:54:40 You proved the point: no universal check or registry yet exist. Not sure why perfection is the standard for gun control now but not for anything else. Laws/regs exist for other things (drugs, driving, stocks, etc) & sometimes people break them, doesn’t mean you get rid of the law
4875 2018-01-19 07:53:51 Merger within HDFC may be on cards !!! Also Small bank Stocks should be accumulated as they can be take over / merger - as consolidation is the key in banking sector during 2018
4876 2018-01-19 07:53:38 Would be interesting to ask them if they have ever accepted one. Another provider told me the same thing but I then found out they actually do accept them reluctantly.
4877 2018-01-19 07:53:24 I think an interesting question would be which providers “have”!
4878 2018-01-19 07:52:19 But to be completely fair I have to say that short term effects as visible in actions #Apple just announced seem strong and positive. New jobs and bonus stocks for employees are certainly good news with what ever company. Now let's wish and hope for positive long term effects.
4879 2018-01-19 07:51:42 Sorry I meant providers who will *not* accept insistent clients.
4880 2018-01-19 07:50:59 Think about what happened in the stocks!

4888 2018-01-19 07:47:59 Only if it was one of her in stocks
4889 2018-01-19 07:47:56 Mostly, correction let us know the true worth of a stock. Especially mid and small caps. We buy some stocks due to  trend / news/ speculations. Correction gives us an opportunity to remove these stocks from portfolio. Some small term stocks considered as long term by us wrongly.
4890 2018-01-19 07:47:54 Can you think of any examples? I think some providers say this but in practice accept them.

4894 2018-01-19 07:45:07 Assume this was because of bad management? Let’s hope this is not a trend for other spec stocks that are about to provide results to market!

4896 2018-01-19 07:43:52 And clearly, a number will.
4897 2018-01-19 07:43:08 A number of providers won't accept insistent client transfers and therefore will only accept cases with a 'yes' recommendation.

5105 2018-01-19 04:59:07 a few, i wouldn't. when it comes to long term portfolio etf's or even stocks, I have a rule, if i can't buy enough to lower the % of commission cost, you want to keep it low---for example the last time i bought 10 share to keep the overall % of the cost to around 1%.
5106 2018-01-19 04:58:47 I was just wondering. I think I would buy if the stocks split it would allow me to add more shares.
5107 2018-01-19 04:57:56 ll this positivity is already factored in into prices.
Those with advance knowledge were buying when these stocks were hitting circuits.
Now poor public will check this old stale data and buy these stocks at "too high" valuations and then cry "operator" tricked them
5108 2018-01-19 04:56:26 we have no targets.... only following stocks till they allow us to follow. The stocks will themselves tell us to get lost when it is time.  We only listen. No command.

5120 2018-01-19 04:47:31 Then how do you explain his 36%approval? Maybe because 30% of the country own stocks otherwise known as his donors
5121 2018-01-19 04:44:03 why max 401k? you lock your money up until your old. Just invest in stocks yourself and use that money when you want.
5122 2018-01-19 04:43:54 @GOP and @POTUS are crushing it. Economy is rocking, raises in min wage, stocks at all time high, 401k are filling up. You and dens have contributed nothing.

5128 2018-01-19 04:38:44 Lol imma start investing in stocks soon
5129 2018-01-19 04:38:26 OMG!  I’m so ashamed. I forgot about that and how we couldn’t even get the bump stocks out!
5130 2018-01-19 04:37:12 Def some merit to that.  Yet, in my personal experience there are a decent number of elderly that never owned stocks. My grandparents only used bank CDs. Same in wife’s side of family.
5131 2018-01-19 04:36:09 You mean on an economic high with low unemployment, record breaking stocks and companys bringing back businesses. Oh, the horrors. Eyeroll.

5133 2018-01-19 04:35:41 I've been quite undisciplined w/ my weeds stocks (volatility & all), I buy & sell & buy again. My current avg. price on ACB is 13.47. But while I'm technically down at the moment, I'm still a good bit up from where I started with ACB, so can't really complain too much.

5141 2018-01-19 04:29:36 I don't think so, talk to my 81 year old mom who has a reasonable (age appropriate) amount allocated to stocks and has been reducing when rebalancing, problem is the fixed income portion that has been called and or matured over the years.
5142 2018-01-19 04:28:51 Haha, was just thinking the same. A but of kite flying to build a "consensus" opinion. Stocks already in red now.
5143 2018-01-19 04:28:42 Moe if you actually did that stupid pyramid scheme youre idiotic  instead of scheming people make some real money off stocks or you know. A job.
5144 2018-01-19 04:28:41 Pistol grip stocks and supressors are not just cosmetic. Although I will agree the tactical advantage of them is negligent 99 percent of the time.
5145 2018-01-19 04:27:42 that's why you can never listen to any noise that happens on social media or stockhouse. sometimes it's good to scan new stocks, but real DD on your own is essential to your success.

5227 2018-01-19 03:39:11 I'm okay with banning bump stocks, but I'm afraid it's just another mousetrap/mouse scenario.  Ban bump stocks, folks will just invent a new method.  We have to stop reactionary public policy, because it's just ways to create new loopholes.  It's pointless.

5253 2018-01-19 03:20:15 Hi John,

Do you think the U spot price is being manipulated?  It doesn't make sense, as one day it increases $.10 and another day decreases $0.20 etc.  But the increase/decrease has an impact on the U stocks.

5260 2018-01-19 03:16:30 I'm doing Twitter wrong: I told people I know face to face that tapering QE might decrease bond prices & get institutional money out of equities and into bonds thereby negatively impacting stocks. Now experts are saying it and I can't retweet what I told people in person. #noob
5261 2018-01-19 03:16:28 Collecting a high % but you are still paying money out of pocket month over month. It’s not worth it. Investing money only to pay more money, you’re banking on growth. I’d rather invest in a diversified portfolio of dividend stocks/ETFs, you get paid from day 1.

5275 2018-01-19 03:02:40 No, it’s not ok. This is illegal in stocks and is only happening here because we aren’t being regulated yet. I understand that you think it’s the fault of the person pulling the trigger, but you have to think beyond that. Many things wouldn’t be illegal if that was the case.
5276 2018-01-19 03:01:54 Keynes said that. Last week Buffett said that with current interest rates and tax rates stocks are not overvalued but ymmv
5277 2018-01-19 03:01:33 Research. Test your hypothesis. Talk to others. Check for anchor investors who enter into stocks not for 30-40% gains.
5278 2018-01-19 03:00:04 Investors on 364 days of year- you should never focus on daily movement of stocks.

5291 2018-01-19 02:53:51 That was, but I think right now people are just putting money in stocks because there's nowhere else to put it.
5292 2018-01-19 02:53:47 it does not mean that. Stocks, real estate, art, etc. are also considered stores of value. Stable value assets are a subset

5309 2018-01-19 02:47:17 It's sad because most are getting squeezed by the state and inflation.  They see other ppl making $ on crypto and will believe anything but that it's a negative-sum game or downright scam.  They're better off just trading stocks or forex

5340 2018-01-19 02:32:53 Didn’t say 100K was needed for a 401K. I just said if you make that much or more than the stock market really impacts you more. As the top 10% in wealth owns 70% of all stocks. Agree with your wages comment thought.
5341 2018-01-19 02:32:41 Yeah likely no deal at all. You should just sell what you own and move on. I have some friends who will buy them from you. I will buy them. Sell them to the bid in the morning. I will be there. Lol

5376 2018-01-19 02:20:18 I choose my stocks from the S&P100 based on four simple measures: dividend yield, EPS, P/E, and % below the 52-week high.
5377 2018-01-19 02:19:35 Hey @YtWhite that slip was a replacement slip from novamedia for members who ordered their lenti edition. What you can do is to approach nova directly and request for one to go with your next purchase with them if they still have stocks! Cheers :)
5378 2018-01-19 02:19:02 Stocks like Coal India have been behaving similar to NTPC and Powergrid. Give a trading pop every quarter and then go back to original levels and sleep for another quarter :)
5379 2018-01-19 02:18:48 It can be seen from the recent mania in lithium stocks on the back of the majors all going up strong which obviously includes the ETF as a broader snapshot of the entire industry. With somewhat opaque pricing on LCE the markets been using the ETF as a measuring stick.
5380 2018-01-19 02:18:36 Money recorded eat from massive stocks !
5381 2018-01-19 02:18:29 Well they can fine people all they like Gordon but to say buying in a lot of these stocks which often runs off the back of outrageous claims is natural ...well ,that's not how the market works buddy. We all know where most of them end up

5387 2018-01-19 02:15:18 You need to trust your gut, you have to be prepared to lose it all to have the guts to buy some of these stocks...  That being said, I've tried investing in a few and also I've gone all in on some.. dyodd and trust your gut.
5388 2018-01-19 02:14:23 "Even amid a surging stock market"

The top 10% of American households, as defined by total wealth, now own 84% of all stocks as of 2016. But yeah, record dow Jones means something to average Americans.
5389 2018-01-19 02:13:39 I would if I were you USD or stocks are much safer but I am not here to give financial advice. It’s all my opinion and I am not a financial advisor.
5390 2018-01-19 02:13:15 POTUS is playing the games who you fooling?  When Republicans control all facets of the Whitehouse. 80% of stocks are owned by 20% of the people (TAX BREAKS ANYONE?).

5395 2018-01-19 02:11:02 You can see this in the number of stocks each player gets per game in tournaments.
Smash Brothers - 5
Melee - 4
Brawl - 3
Sm4sh - 2
This is done to keep matches within a certain time limit. People love a good show, and the speed of melee is highly attractive in that regard.
5396 2018-01-19 02:09:41 Stock market down, buy some more stocks. Just means the price dropped and now you can get it on sale.
5397 2018-01-19 02:09:19 $CDIF big upward move will be on the coming 8K and PR for merger completion
5398 2018-01-19 02:09:15 SPX Failed three days in a row at 2800 on heavy volume all three days.  I now know what that wide red bar means and warning signs are flashing. During the day stocks are mixed and lethargic.  Agree 100% with you Mr. X too much risk right now.
5399 2018-01-19 02:08:54 @SenWarren @WarrenBuffett  hmm, china with fake data,soumds like that 1980's wall street game you played in the Wachovia banks doesnt Buffett. Hahaha. I warned you not to.invest into china. You lost, they have no legal code in stocks there.
5400 2018-01-19 02:08:44 Stocks and bonds? I wouldn't invest in Rebel Alliance equipment, since they don't have a lot of great resources. And the Banking Clan totally fudged my final quarter profit margins... again! Last time I let them sign on to anything. They're just not real time players.

5420 2018-01-19 01:57:48 IS did claim responsibility, it depends on who he thinks is more credible - Deep state Las Vegas police or islamic terrorists.

BTW is it time to start talking about gun control? Or is it too soon?  (to stop the sale of bump-stocks)
5421 2018-01-19 01:57:46 After reviewing presented strategies by brokers, it's interesting to note that despite higher disposable income being expected in 2018, analysts are cool towards stocks that should benefit from mo' money and prefer other sectors. #nonconsensus #stockpicksPH

5431 2018-01-19 01:48:58 The Dow and the Nasdaq doing well is not indicative of a healthy economy. That just illustrates the rich people getting richer. Most people do not benefit when the stocks go up. They have to stay up until I retire and utilize my 401k.
5432 2018-01-19 01:48:28 SQM approved to increase their lithium production. Hence why lithium stocks getting smashed. Was always going to happen. Interestingly is affecting other battery related stocks (eg cobalt)...even though a drop in lithium price is actually a GOOD thing for EV demand. Opportunity.

Hello ??? @mega_magazine @annecurtissmith @vicegandako 
5444 2018-01-19 01:39:52 Nope. I have no large fixed expenses, makes a steady and safe income, have a 401k in stocks, and my folio is still up plenty even after a pretty significant crash.I realized some gains there though
5445 2018-01-19 01:39:12 I have stocks. Not comparing here.
5446 2018-01-19 01:38:28 stocks traded today

5447 2018-01-19 01:37:47 You must be a spender. I started investing 4 years ago in stocks&mutual funds. Took some profits and put it into real estate. Enough passive income to quit my job if I wanted.
5448 2018-01-19 01:37:34 I guess everyone on this Tweet thread will now be selling all their 401k stocks and donating the profits to charity...because Trump is evil and you don’t want anything to do with evil...so sell now..
5449 2018-01-19 01:36:28 Sell bonds buy stocks
5450 2018-01-19 01:36:15 How long until dividend stocks really start to bleed? Utilities are down, but others holding up well.

5456 2018-01-19 01:32:02 ...just like money has flooded into ETFs for bonds, stocks, commodities. It would flow into crypto ETFs. Larger investor base, liquidity and ease of funds onto Main Street, e.g. people scared of exchanges.

5461 2018-01-19 01:30:38 In case anyone missed it $CSGP blew through its all time high with strength and is one of my favorite stocks I own. This is a buy and hold rather than short term but has much more room to go eoy target of $435
5462 2018-01-19 01:30:23 Yes I do own stocks, crypto, and gold. Plus when the economy is doing good it means more corporate not government jobs and less people on welfare so lower taxes, happier healthier people. AKA America Great Again. News flash. 

Mexico .
5463 2018-01-19 01:30:14 I saw this tweet and wanted to share my view, I'm newish too so up to you....why not spread 10k across say 4 different stocks. Don't put it all in 1 stock to start. Just in case one goes South. Bare in mind, I've had a few beers tonight...haha
5464 2018-01-19 01:29:56 That bump stocks are still totally legal because of the borderline terrorist NRA and spineless Republicans?
5465 2018-01-19 01:28:49 We are in the camp of keeping our allocation across stocks same because our basic premise is that we DONT KNOW  or CANT FORECAST which stocks will outperform. We dont claim to have that capability!  Yes over time some allocations go up. Goa is up at 17% from 4%!

5470 2018-01-19 01:24:03 Oh, sorry, I get it. My point was that when you do it right you can also take in all of these factors when you're trading stocks (but not so much when you trade cryptocurrency). To me, trading stocks is just short term investing.
5471 2018-01-19 01:20:02 What they are pumping in your car are "old stocks". Once they get new supplies, prices will adjust.
5472 2018-01-19 01:19:42 I have a number of these  stocks
5473 2018-01-19 01:17:42 Stocks up really? They’re over 26000 now. Businesses are investing in America now and no offense but ur delusional if u really believe unemployment at record low.

5475 2018-01-19 01:14:38 “People are blogging like crazy about the upcoming Gabichic IPO launch.” Tell me, soap twitter. Do you often blog about stocks going public?  #DAYS
5476 2018-01-19 01:13:12 I'm amazed by how some ppl would prob make so much easy money if they just started trading crypto even if they don't believe in it. Seems to me it's much easier than comm. and stocks. Is that just pure ego, not enough liquidity? Or just hating but actually trading as well?
5477 2018-01-19 01:13:05 @HammerNation19 Anyone who hates President Trump and made money in stocks since his election should give there profits to charity !!!
5478 2018-01-19 01:12:50 The back-end of the curve had weakness all day as 10 and 30yr yields rose ~2.5 and ~3.5bp, respectively.  10 and 30yr yields are def. bumping up to levels that are becoming a bigger focus for stocks and property (~2.6% and ~3%, respectively).
5479 2018-01-19 01:10:24 yeah penny stocks used to be the worst. crypto kiddies took over though. the bots and these kids asking you to pump or sign up constantly it's enough to give you a migraine.

5483 2018-01-19 01:08:45 Thanks what I have found is that stocks have more situations that have to B accounted 4. I am  also controlling the trade 2 account 4 the possibility that I am wrong quicker. 4 example tomorrow FB if it takes out177.08 I would want 2 be out if long. Using all the tools N the shed
5484 2018-01-19 01:07:58 so thats NO STOCKS at all then basically.
5485 2018-01-19 01:07:44 In fact the only value here is providing some evidence of what’s taught in undergrad - stocks and bonds are inversely correlated (except when they’re not). Historically >10% sell-off in 10yr has coincided w/ large drawdowns in equities i.e. they become correlated in crisis

MAGA TRUMP
5502 2018-01-19 00:57:06 Hey Morning Schmoe... get a grip ... how much did your stocks go up?  Embarrassed??? Not more than 1/2 the country!!! Trump is winning... Dems are losing... and here comes the Kenyan again
5503 2018-01-19 00:56:51 Do utility stocks care about long rates or short rates? $XLU
5504 2018-01-19 00:53:38 Jim Cramer explained how he uses his shopping experiences to help determine which retailer stocks are not worth…
5505 2018-01-19 00:52:23 I can tell it’s really crashing, go invest in some stocks and get back to me down the line when you are wealthy
5506 2018-01-19 00:51:53 You do realize there are real world events going on, right?
ISIS retreating
Unemployment down
Stocks rising
Wages rising
More jobs 
Just to name a few. 
It’s the economy STUPID!
Report on that.
5507 2018-01-19 00:50:23 I have my eye on $EPAZ, $INTV and $DIGAF when it comes to crypto related stocks. As for coins.., $TRX and $XVG have potential to have a great year! IMO
5508 2018-01-19 00:50:23 And to buy back stocks, which raises the stock market.
5509 2018-01-19 00:50:19 Please don't let ATF ban bump stocks on the 25th. Your doing great so far, please don't let ATF ruin your awesome first term. Thanks
5510 2018-01-19 00:50:17 Facing congressional inaction, states move to ban bump stocks
5511 2018-01-19 00:49:41 Why not take 10 mil from the #ussf surplus and invest in stocks and bonds and what ever profit it makes goes to designated underserved communities to create free leagues etc. Why not make this commitment, for every 100 mil, 10 mil goes into this investment. Keep building it.
5512 2018-01-19 00:48:31 Glad you liked the top 5 EPS #Stocks @Linda_ST_PT $LRCX $SUPN both working on cup patterns. Have a wonderful day.
5513 2018-01-19 00:47:56 @GregMannarino Hey Greg, what do you think of the idea of buying commodities right now? How about Australian stocks ie lithium for Tesla batteries, & metal (iron ore, copper) producers? Will the USD tracking down be good news for BHP in 2018 as they sell for USD?
5514 2018-01-19 00:47:12 Optimism is okay, buying bad quality is not... in 2014 there were many stocks which would go up 5% a day, went up 2x retraced a bit and are now probably 3x - All were quality businesses
5515 2018-01-19 00:47:04 just wondering if I could get a breakdown of what is covered in your trading course? Do the techniques taught in the course apply to both crypto and stocks? currently just trading crypto, always had interest in stocks, but fees were to high to get into @Goonalerts
5516 2018-01-19 00:46:46 Hey Greg, and everyone else, what do you think of the idea of buying commodities right now? How about Australian stocks especially lithium for Tesla batteries, and metal (iron ore, copper) producers? Will the USD tracking down mean good news for BHP in 2018 as they sell for USD?
5517 2018-01-19 00:46:27 Our president might suck, but god damn my 401k and stocks are doing fucking phenomenal right now. #im60 #retiringamillionare
5518 2018-01-19 00:46:12 Nikkei drops; mining, oil and shipping stocks lose ground, Bitcoin shares tumble
5519 2018-01-19 00:45:42 Where the #SPI 200 futures are now looks like where the #ASX200 physical wants to go...

5956 is the 38.2% retracement of the rally from Oct 2017 to this month's high

5523 2018-01-19 00:43:05 Although the £ really nose dived but other business carried on as usual.  Prices have already gone up considerably because of the low brexit £.  As stocks run out and are replaced businesses will pass on the costs
5524 2018-01-19 00:40:46 Correlation causation? While stocks go up fed hikes, when they fall it cuts.
5525 2018-01-19 00:40:37 I throw majority of my money into my 401k and my stocks. Trying to live a nice granny life in the future.
5526 2018-01-19 00:40:16 @juanchoblandon Bad stocks (companies) rally all the time. ex SUNE Means nothing to me as a swing trader.
5527 2018-01-19 00:39:16 Not at all what I’m telling you ... graphic just looks at upward moves in Treasury yields and whether they have corresponded to upward moves in stocks ... simply chart of facts of the past 17 years (stocks and bond yields have been positively correlated, which won’t last forever)
5528 2018-01-19 00:39:07 @Trendisurfriend fairly new to stocks and trading. I’m long term on this one. Don’t know much about options and things like that
5529 2018-01-19 00:38:27 Being reliable is extremely important. Being reliable will open more doors than one can believe. No matter if you're working for someone, running your own business, or trading stocks. I've missed many trade positions because of being pulled away from the trading table.
5530 2018-01-19 00:37:56 What is going on with all the other Lithium stocks like Pls, ajm, gxy etc all down near 40% cause of Sqm?? This is insane!!
5531 2018-01-19 00:36:47 Cheers, believe they have a limited selection of ASX stocks, not all specs/small caps... makes sense if they/someone has to take the other side of the trade when most specs fail, their edge would be ducked
5532 2018-01-19 00:33:54 Sold all of my weed stocks last week... The sector was way too overpriced. I put most of the money onto $FAT and $Ime. I DID BUY LG$ again as I tought it was one of the ones that still had legs but that was obviously a mistake since it has dropped 0.2 since then
5533 2018-01-19 00:33:26 GDP stocks up unemployment down business investing here . So exactly what is it that u c. We will wait for ur rest. Ur obviously a liberal but try to post facts
5534 2018-01-19 00:33:16 Yesterday I had only 400 stocks 0$ in power $ but today I have 4$ I didn’t have yesterday
5535 2018-01-19 00:32:22 Yes and no.  If the rate hike is bigger than has been telegraphed or raised more quickly because inflation is coming in too high, expect a tantrum, possibly in both Treasuries and securities (stocks).
5536 2018-01-19 00:32:03 They lay off 1/4 the plant every winter and hire like crazy in summer with mandatory 6 day weeks in 100* factory. It’s crazy. Original owner built this TOWN,library,town hall etc.paid well plus gave stocks to employees.he dies and new owner uses u up and throw u away. 
5537 2018-01-19 00:31:30 Stocks are down... gonna blame him for something or another
5538 2018-01-19 00:30:31 Not cnn or msnbc. We get it from reality. GDP stocks up unemployment down. Less illegals. Alls well
5539 2018-01-19 00:27:47 @utsav1711 why are many of the stocks coming down while Indices are all time high?
5540 2018-01-19 00:27:25 I just got off the phone with @realDonaldTrump he told me $TVOG will be 1st in line to profit from the $1 Trillion #infrastructure bill he will signing this is good news #Stocks #investment #bitcoin #blockchain #shipping
5541 2018-01-19 00:26:26 Okay my bad. But still the Economy is doing great under President Trump (And Not someone else who sits at Home taking care of the Family). Haven't you heard about the Black and Latinos Unemployment Rate, the GDP, Stocks in 2017? They were great under President Trump! #Trump2020
5542 2018-01-19 00:25:13 my paycheck and stocks are looking great Joanna. How are your’s?

5544 2018-01-19 00:23:55 LMAO—Large Institutional Players & Amateurs just Buy Stocks!  MOST Traders & Investors—who know what they’re doing, buy Pullbacks at Specific prices—in the Uptrend!
5545 2018-01-19 00:22:28 DID YOU KNOW 1 SHARE OF @dowjones industrial stocks = THE REAL MEDIAN INDIVIDUAL INCOME of $26,695! NOT a living wage. 84%+ Americans CANNOT AFFORD 1 SHARE OF MARKET! @goldmansachs @morganstanley @business @foxbusiness @reuters @cnbc @cnnmoney #capitalism! or #socialism? @potus

5547 2018-01-19 00:20:14 THIS  IS SUCH    A  MAJOR  MOVE   AND LITTLE IS SAID     STOCKS WILL HIT  32000 EASY.   WOW.    TRUMP SAID WE MIGHT GET TIRED OF WINNING......NO WAY..LOVING IT.
5548 2018-01-19 00:19:30 @seanhannity I would love to stand in front of congress and say"YOU BUNCH OF UNEDUCATED FREELOADERS, I am paying your salary, for this??  Pres. Trump has ripened your stocks & bonds, for this?? MOVE OVER AND LET SOMEONE THAT CARES ABOUT "US" DO THE JOB YOU OBVIOUSLY CAN'T!!!!!!"
5549 2018-01-19 00:19:15 @GunOwners @GunOwners Made my comment to the ATF concerning banning butt-stocks. Absurd! Hopefully it helps.
5550 2018-01-19 00:18:45 You still don't get it. Reality is more than just  concept. 

Gov't control never works. Meth 7600 deaths per year. Cocaine 10,600. Heroin 15,400. Prescription opioids 14,400. 

Outlawing bump stocks will not remove them from society. It never does.
5551 2018-01-19 00:18:44 @realDonaldTrump Please stop the ATF from the NPRM that would interpret the statutory definition of a machinegun. If you want a law banning "bump stocks", do it through Congress! The current definition is TOO VAGUE and open-ended. #SecondAmendment
5552 2018-01-19 00:18:31 Di ba MAC lippie din yung gamit ni Meng noon sa isang photo shoot tapos na sold out ng fans? Hindi pa sya endorser noon ha? so papano yan ngayon? Dapat marami stocks nila sa shade ni Maine para fair at makabili  lahat

5553 2018-01-19 00:16:12 Dan can't think straight since Trump was elected. Before Trump he was just big nose but contributed. Now he just yells at anyone bullish on stocks or tax reform....
5554 2018-01-19 00:15:17 Best smackdown of political big nose Dan who belongs on MSNBC not CNBC with his Trump hate turning him into a yelling troll at anyone bullish stocks. @RichartRoss is the man! #Truth
5555 2018-01-19 00:14:51 @Thorgood For the most part there is no fear and no real exit plan and many will wait till their stocks go a lot lower before taking action.

5560 2018-01-19 00:11:56 I'm actually surprised that the $XSO chart has cooled off as far as it has without too many stocks getting belted. Breather had to come but so far it's been relatively orderly, hopefully stays that way, def still pointing further down overall.

5563 2018-01-19 00:07:48 yo, japan economy is so strong now. what happened? stocks rising higher and higher!
5564 2018-01-19 00:07:18 It truly sounds like you are upset there are plenty of younger people out here making a killing. Please if you don't like Crypto leave our space and stick to trading regular stocks.
5565 2018-01-19 00:07:10 Please @VickiMcKenna tell the guy you had on earlier to never mention investing again. In bonds cause he taught Obama would kill the economy and only now will go into stocks b/c of Trump. He should realize investing based on a political view already failed him.
5566 2018-01-19 00:06:17 You are pretty good when you chart Forex and stocks but please don"t give us advice on something you were wrong many times. I could find hundreds of charts you posted where you were euphoric as a little kid and claiming bitcoin could reach 30K$ within a few weeks. 
Pathetic.
5567 2018-01-19 00:03:18 When you catch them can we have them in stocks and throw what they fly tipped at them please?
5568 2018-01-19 00:02:55 This guy wants the market to drop so that his pe KKR scoops up on some stocks? My trust in Wall Street pundits zero. Always self serving!
5569 2018-01-19 00:02:37 Nope, by that metric stocks would be abandoned. Volatility is opportunity, and as a speculative asset with finite supply, low transaction fees, and high liquidity, it is very successful. It will only increase in value as more people engage with it, exactly as we've seen.
