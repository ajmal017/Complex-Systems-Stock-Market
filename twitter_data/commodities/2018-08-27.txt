4 2018-08-27 23:02:48 All I’m saying is do we know for sure that Santa Claus ISN’T a powerful psychic demon created intentionally by corporations to ensure that Christmas remains about the exchange of commodities rather than love and family and helping those in need?

6 2018-08-27 22:32:25 The ASX is set to open higher following US and Mexico’s preliminary trade agreement (NAFTA). US stocks were up, posting record highs. 
The #USD traded down whilst Turkey’s Lira slumped as feuds continue. 
Commodities were higher, with exception of iron ore.

30 2018-08-27 21:49:45 Bragging about your reusable bottles, straws, etc does not actually take plastic out of the ocean if you didn’t know. But it does make people who don’t have easy access to such commodities feel badly.
31 2018-08-27 21:41:02 In my case this was an over design decision. 

Amazingly it seems one can legally publish a protocol that reflexively issues a commodity that has a cashflow to discount, I think the world could use such commodities.
32 2018-08-27 21:33:56 The people who we can't criticise .Follow the money and corruption,we are their commodities getting driven back into slavery,cash cows. Who controls the printing presses are pulling the strings. In plain sight.

35 2018-08-27 20:56:03 SD producers grow the world’s best commodities & cattle. They deserve to be able to trade those goods in a fair, open & competitive market. @realdonaldtrump's announcement today is encouraging. I’m hopeful it's a 1st step in again offering SD producers greater trade certainty.
36 2018-08-27 20:51:17 I wonder when we'll reach that stage with real estate sales? Especially relative commodities like certain sizes & ages of condos.
37 2018-08-27 20:50:29 Choice is not bad per se...except for when it comes to the USD's monopoly on the pricing of oil & other commodities.  Then choice is bad...for the USD.
38 2018-08-27 20:46:25 I’m not saying it should be air, I’m saying it should be trees and forest lands that give air, if they were valued higher as they should be it wouldn’t get to a point wear water or air commodities. Earn interest on maintaining jungle and trees instead of a lump payment to cut it.

40 2018-08-27 20:42:16 This power dynamic is the main reason that I have cut the NFL out of my life. I'm just one consumer (one drop in an ocean), but more than any other sport athletes feel too much like commodities and not people. Not nearly enough interest in safety. It's just a bad culture.

42 2018-08-27 20:35:36 Cara, economia não é astrologia, não existe "eu acho", existem análises, com algumas versões. Uma análise bem coerente é a do livro "A valsa brasileira", da Laura Carvalho, professora da USP, recomendo. Ela avalia que a crise das commodities e más decisões de Dilma levaram a isso

44 2018-08-27 20:25:17 But these people are given medical attention, legal aid and other social commodities at the cost of tax money while many locals struggle to pay their bills, insurance, education etc... Easy access to the EU but corrupt societies will still be corrupt overseas
45 2018-08-27 20:21:44 I think you could plan a great Victorian seminar through Elizabeth Gaskell's Cranford: banking changes, empire, xenophobia, occult, class and gender, railroads, print culture, commodities, craft... and I think I'm just the one to plan it. #Victorian
46 2018-08-27 20:14:59 Éste es una bestia. Nunca salimos de la matriz agroexportadora. La fórmula de crecimiento en la dékada sakeada se resume en "soja y suerte". Viento de cola que alzó los precios de las commodities de  las cuales dependemos. Que se okupe de lo suyo.

50 2018-08-27 20:00:25 Alla have given religious right to lie, pretend and do Taqqiya. Truthfulness, loyalty, honesty, sense of sacredness and holyness are completely alien commodities for them.

54 2018-08-27 19:45:22 I make no recommendations. I concentrate on strategy diversification:, including rotation into commodities/bonds and equity long/short along with conventional equity trendfollowing. Good % of gains will evaporate in next bear market so diversification is important.
55 2018-08-27 19:25:36 Went to Costco with my Taiwanese friends and tutorees this afternoon. i like the crowd their. But the commodities not so much. The clothing they sell is so shoddy. So I'm skeptical about their "organic" food products.
56 2018-08-27 19:09:43 The interconnected global economy, the way stocks, currencies, and commodities are traded, invites and encourages Economic Wars. If you want World War III, just keep going down this path. We need major reforms in those areas.

101 2018-08-27 16:23:30 Ummmmm, this is exactly how capitalism is supposed to work. Labor is a commodity. Like all other commodities, there is a demand which has a price. The price is determined by what the market will bear for that commodity. Capitalist do not invest in labor, do not value labor.
102 2018-08-27 16:22:40 Slaps are not tradable commodities. The process of allocation is arbitrary and based on an individual assessment.
103 2018-08-27 16:18:21 Government intervention or manipulation of commodities amounts to modern day price controls. History teaches us price controls always break leading to chaotic price increases. Will this time be different because it is so well disguised? I doubt it.

115 2018-08-27 15:48:47 You really are a very peculiar person. You don’t understand how fruit and vegetables are grown and you don’t understand the nature of water itself.
Why on earth are you proposing that commodities that can never be non-halal be labelled as though they are?
116 2018-08-27 15:44:23 Basic human decency these days is rare enough to be traded on a commodities exchange like gold.
117 2018-08-27 15:43:55 No one withholds commodities, they sell them.
118 2018-08-27 15:43:44 El Oro como todos los commodities, sufre oscilaciones especulativas, está en mínimos históricos como ya pasó en 2016, quien considere que es un "recurso estable" para construir ahorros con eso es un tonto.
Quien lo compra lo hace para especular, no para "garantizar sus ahorritos"
119 2018-08-27 15:40:54 Seriously, you are wrong.  Trump met match, he had no other choice than to concede.  Mexico slap tariffs on some of America's most needed commodities, apples, pork, potatoes, etc.  Stupid to congratulate someone on losing a fight!  No brainer!  Farmers wrer losing out!
120 2018-08-27 15:35:51 That's fine if that's your view but reality is farming has always been about commodities. Food as a luxury or disposable product is only very recent development.

135 2018-08-27 14:36:43 No, we shouldn't. The problem started far earlier and was about the stupidity of racism that had its origins in white supremacy and slavery. Fundamentally the dehumanisation of people into commodities, that forms the basis of capitalism, as promoted Biblically.

144 2018-08-27 14:15:25 Speaking of Into the Woods, how great is "Agony" (and its reprise that is sadly missing from the film version)? Funny, but also a cutting commentary on entitlement and men treating women as commodities to be sought after. (Further amplified by the aforementioned reprise.)
145 2018-08-27 14:14:17 But then we would see productivity gains and a general collapse of prices for basic  goods and commodities?
As far as I know that is not true and some are even rising (lithium fe, copper also). On productivity most countries are stagnating. So why should the cpi improve?
146 2018-08-27 14:14:12 I agree, but as long as animals are farmed, they will also always be treated as commodities.  That is exactly what the word 'livestock' means - stock that is alive.

170 2018-08-27 12:28:49 Sealed containers on trucks are complete waste of the me otherwise we would do the same when shipping from London to Liverpool. Extra cost extra time. Problem is that not all our exports and imports are high volume commodities, in fact very little is

175 2018-08-27 12:02:01 Once an investor realizes that the worst fear of the Federal Reserve is a real economic recovery he can understand their HFT war on commodities which is a war on miners, farmers, oil producers, investors, & small business.

177 2018-08-27 11:58:36 Reduce the cost of fuel,this will reduce the cost of production. Govt to be strict on regulation of basic commodities prices. Let the government remove double or triple taxing from taxpayers.
178 2018-08-27 11:55:37 Yes, hand spinners and hand weavers lost their livelihoods (though hand  weaving survived) but there was no net loss in purcashing power  because of the commodities boom -- activity shifted from handicrafts to agriculture
179 2018-08-27 11:48:56 Just gave up looking. The jobs he did “create” were in the minimum wage groups. There was no technology boom, or commodities boom, green law after green law suffocated any chance he had at growth. Now, while you don’t like it or you think it’s still Obama’s economy
180 2018-08-27 11:43:24 That doesn't seem to be the key metric to me. Obviously depends on the volume of commodities in each category. Under MFN, if we drop tariffs to one nation we have to drop for all inc EU and there will be no obligation to reciprocate. Doesn't seem wise to me.
181 2018-08-27 11:40:09 The key metric is - how many commodities subject to import tariffs in USA? Do u have that figure? Over 13k for EU and rising. & u don't seem to understand that if we want, we can still protect sections UK agriculture,/manufacturing but vast majority of CU tariffs there 4 other EU

183 2018-08-27 11:24:04 Your lack of concern for the complete lack of democratic accountability for this tax increase is shocking and noted. EU does not have lower tariffs in aggregate or by number of commodities than USA - do the work. But for Post-Brexit UK, that's a low bar to surpass!
184 2018-08-27 11:22:26 Paying miners with non-ETH commodities is difficult, since users don't know which miner will mine any given block. Miners would most likely need to reach a consensus on how fees are paid before users can easily pay miners with tokens other than ETH.

224 2018-08-27 05:25:25 A stable coin isnt Fiat nor is it a valuable commodity.  Fiat/commodities are currently required in order for ANYTHING to have liquidity,  crypto or otherwise.
225 2018-08-27 05:23:35 I've been hearing about cannabis prices from dispensaries around the country and the price is insane. This is a simple plant grown as easy as tomatoes so please explain to me why something so easy to grow isn't priced like grown commodities other than simple greed.

227 2018-08-27 05:11:55 @eikebatista No Estadao , em meio ao expressivo avanço do dólar, que ultrapassou a barreira dos R$ 4,12, as atenções recaem sobre ações de empresas exportadoras e produtoras de commodities. O setor de seguros também é uma boa alternativa, apontam analistas.

230 2018-08-27 05:01:40 @JerryBrownGov Schools should not be for profit. Our children are not commodities to be used to make money. Funds should all go to educating the children.

232 2018-08-27 05:00:10 Its important to stop people from being divided and used as commodities but if they choose so then who can help it?

234 2018-08-27 04:53:19 Relationships between humans aliens religious leaders micro macro business or personal will NOT be healthy relationships if based upon a foundation of slavery or entrapment. Where's love in slavery? Private prisons on s&p500human commodities. Pope look it's real simple...

236 2018-08-27 04:40:43 Cars are also movable and they depreciate. The point I was making is that many people don’t spend to their upper limit just because they can. As a general rule, I detest it when people compare other commodities to housing; it’s not the same thing.
237 2018-08-27 04:19:31 I’m not made for the commodities of the life I’ve been living or the life ppl around me are living. I have this burning urge for more
238 2018-08-27 04:14:14 Whos gonna pay for the agriculture and the production of your commodities? 
I dont wanna pay for food im not eating or for Tampons im not using. FOH and get a Job.
239 2018-08-27 04:12:19 The elites in dying cultures turn everything into a commodity. Human beings are commodities. The natural world is a commodity. Government and democratic institutions are commodities. All are mined and wrecked for profit. Nothing has an intrinsic value. Nothing is sacred.
240 2018-08-27 04:07:12 Again, we are not commodities. Stop it.
241 2018-08-27 04:04:43 Commodities más altos pero el gobiernos maneja otra premisa falsa, cuenta con los dólares de la exportación y no se da cta q las exportadoras no le van a liquidar nada
242 2018-08-27 03:58:28 Once again, women are not commodities or prizes to be won. STOP BEING A CREEPY ASSHOLE.
243 2018-08-27 03:54:16 3. Black people shouldn’t play oppression olymocs w/ each other cause we’re all fungible commodities to the white gaze. 
4. It’s funny you say that Africans can’t say it bc slavery and blah blah.. because there’s currently a market for Black African slaves in Libya. Like rn
244 2018-08-27 03:51:53 Repartir fondos cuando los precios de los commodities está alto es muy fácil...... seria bueno que tuvieran un poco de clases de economía........

247 2018-08-27 03:19:44 Commodities Trading Results (B) - Brent oil:-

1. [31.07.18 - 24.08.18] - Long 75.00, TS 75.09, (Gain 0.12% +/- Int) x20

249 2018-08-27 03:11:29 Uh no. We are not commodities.
250 2018-08-27 03:09:23 Jaiveer, you mean to say India's economy was always good? Do you remember license Raj, Rationing food days in all Metro cities, Shortages of all commodities or just keep talking your habitual nonsense? Congress rule of India was the black years!
251 2018-08-27 03:06:12 U.S. Market Check
U.S. stocks dropped and the dollar rallied the most in two weeks as the trade dispute with China showed no signs of easing. Commodities sank.
The yield on 10-year Treasuries rose one basis point to 2.82 percent.
252 2018-08-27 03:05:53 Yeah and it's preferable at least in my experience to the situation of privately owned power monopolies in neighboring states. I want commodities to be created by someone who wants to make the commodities as consistently as possible not someone looking for profit.
253 2018-08-27 03:03:47 Da commodities are getting smashed harder than all of my opponents in da ring atm! #bitcoin #Elliottwave #btc #Trade #trading #fomo #cryptocurrency
254 2018-08-27 02:59:55 Cómo se cae en esa definición de “cartelistas eternos productores d Commodities”? X tener grandes extensiones y pertenecer a gremiales son cartelistas? Q pasa si un campesino le va bien y empieza a exportar hule a través de una cooperativa, se convierte en un cartelista eterno?
255 2018-08-27 02:56:43 OK, one more time, Settling out of court  is not against the law! What about White Water, Vincent Foster, Paula,Jennifer Flowers ,  Commodities trading, Benghazi, Clinton Foundation, Russian Uranium , I haven’t even scratched the surface 
256 2018-08-27 02:55:37 Empower yourself by being stronger than the capitalist urge to consume addictive commodities.

258 2018-08-27 02:28:06 The market has always fluctuated.  Actually commodities right now are as good as they have been in four years across the board.
259 2018-08-27 02:24:26 Pegando uma carona no papo de vocês, vou dar a minha opinião. O negócio é que, quando as commodities estavam em alta, o Lula fez pelos desfavorecidos e não atrapalhou aqueles que sempre ganharam dinheiro. O problema é que o preço das commodities despencaram e o PT fez uma opção.
260 2018-08-27 02:18:48 With enough MONEY you don’t have to bother unlocking closed doors, you can just create new doors and pathways to the commodities.  ABUNDANCE for the masses will not create “Inflation.”

262 2018-08-27 02:13:05 Em relacao as empresas ajuda sim, nesse ponto concordo com voce.
Mas, no caso, eu estava me referindo ao preço do Brent ( e das commodities em geral), que possuem uma correlacao negativa com o dolar. Tb fui em um evento de commodities e em geral estavam bearish p quase todas
263 2018-08-27 02:06:49 Ajuda sim. Somos um país exportador de commodities em geral. Quanto mais alto o dólar, mais dinheiro entra.
264 2018-08-27 02:00:56 E o dolar pra cima tb nao ajuda em nada. Pra commodities em geral né? Vamos ver. Cenario global nao ta facil nao, rs.
265 2018-08-27 02:00:41 Con los que proponen en desarrollo rural descentralizado comparto la preocupación por la sostenibilidad, el uso de los recursosy el respeto a la identidad de las comunidades.  Con los cartelistas eternos productores de commodities me cuesta hallar ese terreno común.
266 2018-08-27 01:55:07 Yes it is an exploitation. 

On the other hand, people still see that as commodities. Many Gravure idols, if they're lucky enough, can have a breakthrough career in movies and commercials. And those gravure magazines contribute for many new faces in the industry.
267 2018-08-27 01:54:39 Ahí está el pulso político a dar. El debate es sobre todo con los ponentes del agro como motor económico, tanto desde una visión ruralista como los que quieren seguir vendiendo como cartel sus commodities y exprimir el exiguo mercado local.
268 2018-08-27 01:52:04 Capsule hotels are expensive :(
But I guess it depends on how much you're willing to pay for some commodities / convenience.

I've mostly used local netcafe as night camp before a buppan/morning queue whenever I wanted to be earlier than first trains www
269 2018-08-27 01:51:11 I remember reading an article maybe in Forbes about 2013 that farmers would be driving Ferrari’s commodities were on a role !! 
270 2018-08-27 01:42:56 Por isso o investimento veio acompanhado de ensino técnico de nível médio, que tem empregabilidade maior e um retorno mais rápido para o mercado. Mas é como disse, não estamos isolados do mundo, a crise das commodities iria nos afetar internamente de todo jeito
271 2018-08-27 01:33:48 neoliberalisms like "OPEN BORDERS*" 

"* for commodities only"
272 2018-08-27 01:31:11 Surfou a onda das commodities... achou que era pra sempre ... e acabou com o Brasil... nunca mais teremos chance de ser a quinta economia do mundo graças ao desgoverno do PT! Como o senhor ainda tem coragem de babar ovo do Lula? Tá ganhando alguma coisa?
273 2018-08-27 01:28:37 Después de 12 años.. 
No existían registros de los pobres del país. 
Más de 30% de pobres dejaron. 
Se comieron una década de commodities a precios récord. 
El banco central estaba pelado. 
Inflación contenida.
Las escuelas al pedo ya que con los Baradel los pibes no saben leer.
274 2018-08-27 01:23:37 I get the impression these tv anchors are like commodities which can be bought and sold to the highest bidders and they (anchors) alone are responsible for giving this impression by changing their tunes from time to time, seen zero consistency in most of them in recent months..
275 2018-08-27 01:21:29 Commodities & futures contracts have been around for some time. 
276 2018-08-27 01:21:23 No. Since the mid 90's the stock market is increased primarily by the circulation of commodities and not their creation. The creation of use-values can increase stocks but again this doesn't equal a healthy economy because of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall.
277 2018-08-27 01:17:16 "Commodities" were never really correct.  Regional differences always were important.  Going the "commodity" route was a big mistake...
278 2018-08-27 01:14:13 With enough MONEY you don’t have to bother unlocking closed doors, you can just create new doors and pathways to the commodities.  ABUNDANCE for the masses will not create “Inflation.”

279 2018-08-27 01:10:55 I’m done searching for meaning in the aesthetic cycles of commodities.
280 2018-08-27 01:10:35 Ellos si supieron que hacer con el boom de las commodities. No se les quita,y efectivamente generaron crecimiento y bienestar.Pero sus solidaridades automáticas,en mi criterio,los descalifican.

O tal vez esté pecando yo de antipatía automática por ser vzlano y víctima de Maduro!
281 2018-08-27 01:05:35 let's talk about commodities, baby.
282 2018-08-27 01:02:05 Growing is realizing that dropping friendships due to conflicting opinions was not maturity, but the prevalence of individualist patriarchal attitudes. People are not commodities.
283 2018-08-27 00:59:15 @arunjaitley Mr.jaitley don't give us technical jargon like congress quoting that f this f or IMF, honestly see how much investment has come to India ? how are the prices for necessary commodities- petrol for example, what about black moni in swiss bank?
284 2018-08-27 00:58:55 Todo esto está documentado , hace el homework mira los gráficos de los commodities, tasas USA , el Real , gdp growth China periodo Lula ; se empieza a caer china (commodities) y Dilma se queda con EL MUERTO q deja Lula (corrupcion/Petrobras desguazada/gastos gobierno x el techo)
285 2018-08-27 00:54:50 Curiously, AB and SK are often affected by some of the same external factors, such as the price of oil and other commodities. But, the post-recession recovery has been stronger in AB.
286 2018-08-27 00:53:54 Lula un MEGACORRUTO ladron-manipulador que tuvo el ojete único en la historia de la humanidad de 1)china creciendo al 12-15 % 2)suba parabolica de commodities 3)caída sostenida de tasas de interés mundiales y aumento de liquidez/flujos inundando emergentes revalorizando el real
287 2018-08-27 00:48:45 If one trades futures on e_minis, currencies, bonds, commodities, and VIX, the various $COT data published every Friday by CFTC, have got to be on the must-read material every week, having a big picture of how the smart money are being positioned.
288 2018-08-27 00:46:03 So, why just restrict your dicta to housing as there are many other commodities more necessary than housing?
289 2018-08-27 00:36:09 Es muy simple, mucha torta para repartir, mucha menos población, commodities en récord.
290 2018-08-27 00:25:19 I agree. The question was to Mike. Roads aren’t subsidized. They’re public property built with tax money for public use. Gasoline is not subsidized. In fact it’s one of the most heavily taxed commodities at Fed, State, and local levels.
