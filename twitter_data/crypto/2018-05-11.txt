13 2018-05-12 23:56:26 Glad so many people are being open minded about this project and crypto overall, great to hear!
14 2018-05-12 23:56:22 トークンに証券性がないのなら、配当があっても営利目的ではなくなる。トークンの価値がコミュニティにあるのなら、NPOの資金調達やプロジェクトにすごく相性がいい気がした。

23 2018-05-11 23:59:10 Moving forward it will be interesting
To think about
With AR- when does watching ends
& Participation begins
With IOT & Crypto-
where is consumption? Since, to an extent, consumption is delegated
To the world (objects & activities)
around us.

31 2018-05-11 23:58:15 I don’t trade crypto much but ethereum $500 and change looks like a good spot to try and nail it
32 2018-05-11 23:58:08 Can't point to data, but sensing a slow down in larger seeds. Maybe b/c...

a) lots of crypto activity
b) seed funds maturing
c) pre-seeded co's can't do much w/ $750k pre-product
d) overall deal fatigue & liquidity bloatedness

[Wine for tonight is currently breathing...]
33 2018-05-11 23:58:05 It's true though, every time the stupid twins taunt some billionaire to short $BTC, this shit show happens. Last time it was Jamie. Who knows what happened behind the door. I mean those ppl do have egos. Why can't the twin just shut up?

47 2018-05-13 23:58:57 Thanks for your tweets Peter, I always learn a lot
48 2018-05-13 23:58:55 If cash is banned or disabled and crypto takes its place then who ever controls your access to the internet controls your money.   Just sayin

56 2018-05-13 23:57:23 Johnny my boy!!!! You should run your mouth more often - seems like whenever you talk about how all of crypto is going to $0, it does the complete opposite. Keep it up!!!!

58 2018-05-13 23:57:13 people are telling her to kill herself. that’s ridiculous. nobody should be talked to like that over pictures?
59 2018-05-13 23:56:45 I just got in 6 months ago and one person on Twitter kept posting about #TRX so I did research and bought my first. Little did I know how much I love crypto and changed my attitude towards currupt banking institutions. #Litecoin #LitecoinFam
