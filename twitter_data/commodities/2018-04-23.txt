70 2018-04-23 19:15:11 The government is already in massive debt, moron. In contemporary economics, the debt is virtually meaningless and actually beneficial to the extent that it ensures that oil and other commodities are traded in dollars. What does Berne's tweet have to do with spending money?

73 2018-04-23 19:04:02 La transferencia de ingresos sucede. No hay duda. Si la inflación (que siempre supera las proyecciones) es mayor al aumento salarial y de jubilaciones y se siguen exportando commodities, los bancos sin pagar impuestos por los negocios más grandes, las empresas teniendo menos
74 2018-04-23 19:02:37 1. Healthcare is expensive in Kenya. 2. MP Shah is not a government facility where services and commodities are heavily subsidised. 3.

77 2018-04-23 18:51:31 How convoluted...

Folks as dollar increases in value you need LESS of them to buy the commodity, so commodity (priced in dollars) drops in number of dollars needed to purchase.

So if US dollar goes up 10%, all things being equal.. Commodities priced in US dollars will drop 10%
78 2018-04-23 18:51:05 Maybe when positioning is 60,65,70,75,80 % net long.  Not when its 98%.   Recent commodities with big drops after 95% net long positioning include Gold at $1370 (now 1326.)  Russian Ruble (RUR Future)-was 100% net long.  Palladium 98% net long ($1125 to 900 drop last month.)

123 2018-04-23 16:32:46 True, but uranium must be a candidate for the most contrarian sub-sectors of the commodities complex. I'm always interested in a sector trading well below it's cost of production. 

However, to be an investor you MUST be ok with the concept that it may stay that way for some time

In short, the key to quick playoff success is not even drafting well--it's having a rookie QB contract.  Worth more than the draft picks, TBH.

You can replace draft picks (risk to bust or takes time) with money to sign known veteran commodities.

151 2018-04-23 15:02:05 all commodities work on supply and demand. If you reduce the supply the price goes up and alternatives are more attractive.
152 2018-04-23 15:01:13 This is why I love bonds and commodities. They have way more seasonality and mean reversion characteristics than stocks.

242 2018-04-23 09:33:07 I own that book too. It is beyond me how modern 'feminists' can support an ideology that views women as mere chattel, subservient sex slaves and commodities. Where her rights r non-existent and the most vile abject violence done 2 her is seen as just & legal

246 2018-04-23 09:03:40 it does in some regards esp as of late but Korean Pop Idol culture with regards to fans have always had their fans be on more of a personal level with the stars as commodities, marketing them as "personable" people that fans could invest their time in. so my point still stands.
247 2018-04-23 09:01:23 Bond yields are thru the roof, and not just US Treasuries; Malaysian sovereign yields now highest in 16 months. The implication for the stock market is typically negative, even when commodities are rallying. It explains the slowdown in the #KLCI today. #trade #finance

250 2018-04-23 08:14:07 Lol see you throwing 'peace' and 'love' around like that as if they are market commodities. They are some of the most difficult 'things' to secure. Whole civilizations have been wiped out for these two, not to talk of one man and woman! You're funny sha!

252 2018-04-23 08:04:33 If he was talking about why they might be commodities, I can see how that might carry some extra weight. But not this.

254 2018-04-23 07:47:33 That threads articulates why I didn't like the Nike London advert. They excluded every other ethnic group because they don't believe other ethnicities sell trainers as well as us. We are commodities

256 2018-04-23 07:44:27 History has shown that parabolic rises in any entity often correct up to 90% of their value. Very common in commodities.

258 2018-04-23 07:27:39 One flaw that is conspicuous yet we fail to address is the notion of "buying" and not "earning" money. Why does a professor of economics think that a central bank Cryptocurrency will be purchased?

Strong currencies already trade anyway as commodities; being bought and sold!
259 2018-04-23 07:23:27 Your analysis seems to conclude that if Modi doesnt do everything people will bring back Cong that does nothing!
Price of essential commodities controlled. A major achievement you missed.

262 2018-04-23 07:14:56 We used to call them commodities.. canned meat like Spam, orange juice, milk, bread, basics..no extras.  Delivered to the door in boxes.
263 2018-04-23 07:07:23 This deal to fix crude oil exports in USD and ONLY USD, in exchange for "security assistance", forced the world to hold USD for the key commodity. Also, led to more commodities being traded in USD. This allowed US to dispense with fiscal reticence
264 2018-04-23 07:00:58 Osama Bin Laden está morto, Taliban ainda existe e agora IS este e o tipo de democracia que os políticos americanos e ingleses querem nesses países, principalmente na Syria. Na verdade os smerucsbus nunca estiveram interessados no povo afegã mas sim nos commodities

266 2018-04-23 06:51:52 His daddy got him his job. Just like Aaron Banks and Boris Johnson. Farage "decided" not to go to university and rather went into commodities trading, like his drunken father and his brother.

270 2018-04-23 06:17:13 He wasn't a businessman. He worked in commodities for a few years but he joined UKIP aged 29 and was an MEP at 35.
He's got a season ticket for the gravy train.
271 2018-04-23 06:12:07 A PIECE OF UNSOLICITED ADVICE:

Stop worrying about recruits who see themselves as commodities rather than STUDENT-Athletes. We don't need those. What we need is a Bea de Leon or a Thirdy Ravena (Yes! Coz ThirBea is ).

273 2018-04-23 06:00:18 In last week's Equity Overview, Rambus Chartology charts indicate commodities look strong. Should be good for Australia, Canadian and Brazilian markets.

277 2018-04-23 05:09:36 When you’re running a business, time is 1 of your most valuable commodities. Some people feel they r capable of doing bookkeeping, but they may not have d time to do so. As we say TIME IS MONEY, & everything is getting digitized, what if our Bookkeeping can b on our finger tips.
278 2018-04-23 05:03:03 "culture or trash? A provocative view of contemporary painting, sculpture, and other costly commodities" pssst....hey! you're not being provocative James, you're being a dick :))
279 2018-04-23 05:00:42 From the usual place: middle class workers, through taxes, bc the rich will move their money into commodities as soon as the tax hikes come.

281 2018-04-23 04:56:36 Here's hoping Labor brings back the CES that was doing just fine b4 outsourcing..... The unemployed are not commodities 2,b exploited.
282 2018-04-23 04:40:39 About a year ago I asked a lady from WM about the price drop in recycling commodities. She complained about losing money on recycling because the Chinese dropped the commodity price by tightening allowed foreign matter inclusion levels.

This story sounds vaguely familiar....

284 2018-04-23 04:39:15 These jokers must be bothered about price rise of essential commodities, rise in rapes, dumping of vehicles by corrupt transportation depts
285 2018-04-23 04:36:52 Respected PM, we r middle class people. Due to high fuel price , simultaneously Price of essential commodities also increasing too fast. Govt. May consider this request n try reduce the fuel rate n save the poor. You know govt. Is running for the benefit of people.
286 2018-04-23 04:16:49 Some people can overlook anything in return for fame & fortune. There have always been parents who saw their children as commodities & profited off of them. Fortunately, the majority of parents are appalled at this concept.
287 2018-04-23 04:11:50 Because stablecoins offer simplicity. "Hedging one's portfolio" is far from simple. Most people just want a coin that protects their savings in the most simple way possible. Eg. A coin that tracks the value of a basket of commodities would be very useful.
288 2018-04-23 03:25:55 weed and comedy are commodities

307 2018-04-23 01:21:54 Maybe but id rather own cameco which will earn billions in cash flow than a company that needs 1.2b in new capital and needs 7-8 years before we see a dollar in cash flow or production. Especially as commodities are volatile and we may be back at 20 $ in 8 years.
308 2018-04-23 01:21:22 Historically, #silver runs at a 15:1 price ratio with #gold . It has been rising lately. If it goes above 18.50 it might make a run at the 80 dollar mark. #investing #StocksToWatch #stocks #StockMarket #preciousmetals #WallStreet #Commodities #finances #finance #money #NYSE

313 2018-04-23 00:44:04 You’re right that’s the price he’s paid- real human connection. He looks at people as commodities, their value measured transactionally. What they can do for him, how can he use the person etc. He rarely has a long term attachment be it personal with a woman or in business.
