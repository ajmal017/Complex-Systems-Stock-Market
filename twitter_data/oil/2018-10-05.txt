Simmered 30 min or so w/ bay leaf, seasoned w/ salt/pepper, fresh basil, pinch dried oregano, touch of honey.

36 2018-10-06 23:57:06 I spent the entire day drawing on a bookshelf with oil based markers. My back is screaming. My neck hurts. I have a sink full of dirty dishes and I really should eat something. 

I feel amazing. 

These motherfuckers don't get my peace of mind .

39 2018-10-06 23:56:26 Cocoa, diamonds, rare-earth metals, copper, oil, coffee, cotton. Very little is fair trade. Workers receive slave wages and we prop up violent regimes and supply armaments. Almost all our very cheap cocoa comes from West Africa.

53 2018-10-06 23:54:04 I’m talking about the tincture oil. Did you take it every day? Or just used it instead of taking an asprin/pain reliever?

58 2018-10-06 23:53:40 If we are so self sufficient, why are we still importing more than 30% of our oil demand? Because greed is alive & well in oil, and we continue to export oil to benefit from higher prices vs saving U.S. consumers money. #ethanol

61 2018-10-06 23:53:32 I’ve been assured by a Libertarian that EVERYTHING is wonderful, EVERYTHING is getting better all the time, EVERYONE is doing great, giving National Park land to Big Oil is GREAT for environment. EVERY animal is safe. Bad things DONT exist anymore. It has ALL been fixed.
62 2018-10-06 23:53:30 But lot of people supports bjp without even thinking. One of my close relation told that all@petrol hike is due to trump stand with Eran and india cannot go anything with that. I asked him the crude barrel prize is less compare to congress regime but@oil prize is high how ?

65 2018-10-06 23:52:00 JP, you see, is far smarter than average snake oil salesmen on alt-right like sterno and gang. He has a far better idea of how incredibly toxic this mess will become and is therefore insulating his brand name from the massive fallout and consequences of supporting that loser.

78 2018-10-06 23:49:38 This season, our family enjoys pasta con zucco.  We cook pumpkin down, with garlic and oil, then we add it to pasta and top it with grated cheese, parsley and red pepper.  Delizioso!
79 2018-10-06 23:49:34 $113 a barrel yet?  All those electric cars we are told we will be using. Do they use a lot of oil, diesel or petrol?

84 2018-10-06 23:48:41 it should be illegal for bowling alleys to not have ANY oil on their lanes 
85 2018-10-06 23:48:32 It's okay to hold people to minimum standards no matter what day and age it is, especially if they're seen as role models.
86 2018-10-06 23:48:20 Yeah I see a lot of posts oil that on my timeline too. I usually just scroll past it. Not that exciting to me.
87 2018-10-06 23:48:18 Oil make any trades yet???
88 2018-10-06 23:48:18 Not being an economist, can someone please explain what is "Independent Revenue"; guess that means it doesn't include Revenue from Oil export?
And what about the Budget column, isn't that the True/Total budgets for each year cited?
89 2018-10-06 23:48:15 Why has she broken so many promises? She said there wouldn't be industrial action, we would get paid more and they wouldn't ban off shore oil and natural gas exploration... Jacinda's knickers are on fire.

95 2018-10-06 23:47:23 Lastly, get your hair use to being dirty..  It will take some time to not look oily, though, omce the about two-week process is over— your hair won’t look dirty when it isn’t washed because the oil will be evenly distributed throughout your hair shaft.
96 2018-10-06 23:47:01 Hey remember when we had a nonstop oil spill? Those were the days amirite
97 2018-10-06 23:46:53 how do you use the oil? The tincture oil I used I put under my tongue? I think I'm going to try the balm next.
98 2018-10-06 23:46:10 A kind of paste made out of chickpea / sesame / oil/ garlic
99 2018-10-06 23:46:06 According to the Libyan penal code, The criminal Investigation Department is monitoring the work of the stations & is submitting a detailed daily report on violations & applying what has been agreed with the oil services Companies.

104 2018-10-06 23:45:37 1 The oil price has risen substantially since 2014; which is why you don't hear it mentioned by supporters of the unequal union; it always was and is a cyclical industry; prices go up and down. However - Scotland will generate both tax revenue (restoring the income stream) and..
105 2018-10-06 23:45:31 Since fish oil is good for arthritis and fish eat other fish then fish never get arthritis.

112 2018-10-06 23:44:50 Is it the government's fault kaya tumataas ang presyo ng pangunahing petrolyo? The price of oil in the world market keeps on increasing, ano magagawa ng government duon? Tayong consumers ang dapat magtipid. Puro na lang tayo sisi, wala naman tayong ginagawa para makatulong.
113 2018-10-06 23:44:48 Nice! Yeah my uncle makes the oil. It’s my first time using it
114 2018-10-06 23:44:38 Ok so my parents ask said they could give me a early birthday present and I obviously gonna ask them for a set of color pencils and METALLIC OIL PAINT/METALLIC PIGMENT 
115 2018-10-06 23:44:38 sooooo where do you get CBD oil at 
116 2018-10-06 23:44:32 There is a COST for the OIL and a PRICE that has to be paid for it.

122 2018-10-06 23:43:45 Coconut oil leave too much residue in my shit I just put it on top for scent
123 2018-10-06 23:43:42 Blue color whites have a case. They are falling through cracks. Obama and past admins failed them. Trump is still OK as long as he doesn’t touch religion and doesn’t become a puppet of religious snake oil salesmen.
124 2018-10-06 23:43:41 Yeah, at this point it’s a tow and trade-in. Was looking to do the oil change & breaks (because normal maintenance) but this is a serious issue.
125 2018-10-06 23:43:35 Nah. Oil down is shit
126 2018-10-06 23:43:13 My beard brittle af rn cuz I hate putting that chemical ass oil in it and I ran out of my shit
127 2018-10-06 23:42:54 One further point: The oil sands are just too large to stay out of the spotlight as climate change gets worse. We have the world's third-largest oil reserves; "We're too small to matter" isn't going to cut it. Without a real plan, the oil sands will continue to be scapegoated.
128 2018-10-06 23:42:52 Yeah man. Any oil or butter (fat medium) can carry. Just different methods to infuse and control dose or flavor
129 2018-10-06 23:42:47 That should be the code of conduct of our society! But they tend to sway and pick up others culture.
130 2018-10-06 23:42:45 Wish I would’ve seen this earlier but the oil needed to spray me some here at work before I went home 
131 2018-10-06 23:42:32 Al Sharpton the carpetbagging, snake oil charlaton who will always be remembered for his tracksuits and perms

133 2018-10-06 23:41:52 Dick Cheney shot a man in the face on accident!  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal! Faires used to be real, UNTIL THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT MURDERED THEM ALL!
134 2018-10-06 23:41:28 Only Socialism/Communism/Marxism could effectively bankrupt a oil rich country like Venezuela. Somewhere in Hell Hugo Chavez is acting like Adolph Hitler at the 1936 Olympics when Jesse Owens embarrassed his German athletes. @_edwardmondini_ @Adorable_Todd @ntvnyr173

155 2018-10-06 23:38:47 I will harp on this issue
If you believe in freedom and i make a special case of believing in economic freedom then how could you join the ranks of the party that 1)confiscated gas oil deposits 2) gave trade unions rights they never had before 3) hired public employees as never
156 2018-10-06 23:38:40 Ah, was reading about brownies and a chef said olive oil is rarely used, but that it brings it over the top so I thought maybe it was used since they were on a whole other level.
157 2018-10-06 23:38:37 This right here gets the amen. Not the other phonies who dont realize that he doesn't care! Not about their retirement bennies. His admin is stealing from them & Fox  exploits them like a bad tv preacher. All  oil. It's a shame. Took care of all my elders. He ignores his kids!

$85.03 * N361 = N30,695

Under GEJ:
$85.03 * N150 = N12,754

$110 * N150 = N16,500

So, the Buhari admin is earning almost DOUBLE the amount GEJ earned.

Keep this in mind when they say they made no money.
159 2018-10-06 23:38:12 How, HOW does Mummy get her crumpets to 2) cook all the way through without being carbonised on the outside, and 2) get the buggers out of the crumpet rings looking like crumpets??!! No matter how much butter/oil I use, mine stick and end up looking like a dog's chewed them! 
160 2018-10-06 23:38:11 I had been using tincture oil for about 45 days prior to switching to lotion. I had minimal changes (except slept better) with the oil. Switched to the lotion and the paid I've had for five years was gone in two days...until I stopped using it.
161 2018-10-06 23:38:00 Same. I seem to get more acne when my skin is dry than when I oil it though 
162 2018-10-06 23:37:59 Well, oil & gas fks could actually be minions of Satan

Nexus wanted the pipeline in North Dakota & you said in August of 2016 that we need pipelines or oil companies need their pipelines & the Native Americans shouldnt protest so much & their spirituality is like Hippie's spirituality & ha ha!!

174 2018-10-06 23:36:02 @the_SeanO by any chance, did the super mega famous secret deluxe brownie recipe that you made in high school include olive oil?
175 2018-10-06 23:36:00 He's been a grade-A dick to fellow musicians and random fans for the last decade (probably to get that sweet sweet press coverage) but you know, everyone would pass it off as "lmao he's just trolling calm down xd".

182 2018-10-06 23:35:32 Dear @Ford, 

I hope you manage to relocate or found a better way to attach the air duct underneath Ford Explores (that directs air) to the transmission during towing.

Sadly one of your dealerships can't reattach it correctly.

After two different oil changes.

185 2018-10-06 23:34:37 You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.

Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.
186 2018-10-06 23:34:30 Kutus-kutus oil worth the hype gak?

Harganya lumayan soalnya. Dan udah banyak yg palsu dengan harga yg mirip.

Masih setia sama jaga sukma oil-nya botanina yg pasti asli. Krn pas habis dan pas perlu (banget), pengen coba si kutus tapi ragu 
187 2018-10-06 23:34:20 I'm sorry you had to live like that but in this day and age it's more encouraged to be who you wanna be and with everything else in the world some people are not going to like it and I think it would be better if in this instant we would just not acknowledg these people
188 2018-10-06 23:34:20 My formula for success? Rise early, work late, strike oil.

198 2018-10-06 23:32:13 No oil, needs lots of lube, sputters and smokes when she farts. Wouldn't  give a dime for her.
199 2018-10-06 23:32:09 @theRealKiyosaki Here's a note: Werner Ent fails to buy own and run all electronic logging systems.After reaching farther they refuse to help make a law in simple
Talk about CUNTS! The Rockefellers own and run oil. What does that tell you?
200 2018-10-06 23:31:50 Have you tried coconut oil, let it soak in, then put on a heavy moisturizer? That’s what I do with my scales.
201 2018-10-06 23:31:38 Oû ça? Â Pianottoli et Povo, hier, c'était gas oil â 1,61!! Ca a pris 4 cents en 24 heures?  Et 40 cents en 1 an!  Maladetta

204 2018-10-06 23:31:11 Diet reminders: eat oily fish twice a week and take a fish oil supplement on every other day.
205 2018-10-06 23:31:09 US has not made any significant contribution to the economic development of Sri Lanka since the take over of American oil companies in the 60's. China has a longstanding relationship.
206 2018-10-06 23:31:00 Don't know the context of this so probably off base but...

The world you describe ran off whale oil.
207 2018-10-06 23:30:56 Oil price collapsed in 2014...but imagine if LIBOR starts to shift above 3%? Nigeria's borrowing costs already higher than average...
208 2018-10-06 23:30:54 client wants pork chops for dinner and ive never made pork chops before. i slathered em in olive oil and threw them in the oven and will hope for the best i guess!!!

214 2018-10-06 23:29:37 Because the US is dependent on Saudi oil and they have us at their mercy.

218 2018-10-06 23:29:13 Ny Daily News sez:"Turkish investigators say lost Saudi Journalist murdered by 15-member team: Report" Yeah, our staunch ally. You can see why President Parvenu envies them. Too bad Mexico doesn't produce more oil. Tings be different then...

221 2018-10-06 23:28:27 @cenobyte I made your Salsa Lime Chicken in the slow cooker for supper today.  Had steamed veggies drizzled with Persian Lime Olive Oil to compliment it.  Very tasty.  I’ve started my winter fattening up!
222 2018-10-06 23:28:24 There are essential oil blends for pain. Arnica cream for people works pretty well on sore places. Swimming helps my dog a lot!

226 2018-10-06 23:27:44 Of course P1-P0 correlates with P1. But that’s not a theory, and correlation isn’t causation. I think the ‘70s was a Vietnam war inflation that gave birth to OPEC, and the Fed accommodated. That suggests that inflation drives oil prices.
227 2018-10-06 23:26:56 Now I gotta get that oil changed
228 2018-10-06 23:26:40 2. Climate change is happening so let's dig & burn  more coal, punch more oil wells,  & scatter those off shore things all along the world's coastlines.  The economy & trade is incentidental to the bigger picture of the future (& so is my spelling).
229 2018-10-06 23:26:36 Me yesterday: ok this is gonna be a great weekend. Gonna put the boat away, change the oil in the snowblower, change the tires on the car, replace a light fixture, do laundry and mow the lawn.

Me today: I kinda just want to lie on the couch all afternoon.

232 2018-10-06 23:25:53 Just how tweeting about Crude Oil prices isn't going to bring it down, Picking "show-trash" will not clean up the Nation. The Dirt cleans by Real Clean Ops from Above. Enough Tongue rolling/ nitpicking the Tit-bit show bytes for the media people. You are not our entertainment.

242 2018-10-06 23:23:16 Driving around today I saw a sign at an oil change place that said “Cannabis infused oil changes coming soon”. I have no idea what a weed oil change is but I know I want to take my car there when it’s legal
243 2018-10-06 23:23:00 My dog is back in my home country, where I don't think CBD oil is legally available :(
244 2018-10-06 23:22:59 Friends son works there and there was a project to use palm oil and they make the packaging bigger and less chocolate!
245 2018-10-06 23:22:51 But I DID actually want to hear @caitrionambalfe’s take on that “uncomfortable” #NYCC panel question about sexual violence in #Outlander vs. what’s happening today
246 2018-10-06 23:22:26 That sounds great, but my dogs back in my home country and I don't think CBD oil is Available there :(
247 2018-10-06 23:22:15 Well it looks like snake oil PREVAILS AGAIN
248 2018-10-06 23:22:07 Of course I smell like oil 
249 2018-10-06 23:21:59 The smuckers is the best. Have to stir the oil. Fantastic choice here.

Black seed oil keeps your immune system healthy and is said to cure everything but death
251 2018-10-06 23:21:32 You cannot use search visibility reports in place of real search analytics data.  That's SEO snake oil.  Anyone who says you can is either lying or ignorant.  Period. #internet #marketing
252 2018-10-06 23:21:21 Kahn is blind to dogma. There’s more saturated fat in a tablespoon of olive oil than a 100g Pork Chop. I’d rather have the nutrients in the chop. Dietary fat doesn’t cause ‘high cholesterol.’ (WTF), and cholesterol is only a marker not the plaque. Veganist reductive nonesense.
253 2018-10-06 23:20:33 Yes he was on a normalization tour in the US right before he started jailing people in hotels back in Saudi Arabia. As long as we need oil and taking over countries is frowned upon this will continue

265 2018-10-06 23:18:30 Listening to the song “oil filed dad” makes me cry, and me and Robert don’t even have kids yet
266 2018-10-06 23:18:25 This is just smoke and screen by Qatari & Iranian regime and their allies Iran regime and puppets in the leftist media trying to derail the Saudi-US relations ahead of #Iran sanctions that Saudi support is critical to replacing iranian oil. Russians probably planned all of it

280 2018-10-06 23:15:43 The 2014-15 oil plunge and subsequent USD rally caused a global recession—US was spared when US, Asia & European leaders met in Feb to cap USD. Not because of resilience of US economy.
281 2018-10-06 23:15:34 Conversation from NY this week in specialty grocery/bakery:

Me: Does the “olive oil pumpkin bread” have butter replaced with olive oil?

Cashier: I don’t know why it’s called that. I don’t think there’s any olive oil in it.

Me: 

(Result:Yes there was but not as replacement.)

283 2018-10-06 23:15:18 We have a high anxiety dog. We give him CBD oil to help as he also has seizures. A drop or two on a treat will help calm him and maybe sleep better. We have crate trained both of our dogs. Sometimes just letting them cry it out is all you can do
284 2018-10-06 23:15:13 I just got shot by this hot oil on the stove
285 2018-10-06 23:14:25 Brexit was always snake oil. The hucksters promoted it as a cure-all. Stupidly, the distributors (May's government) didn't check what the customers actually expected and whether the product could deliver that before investing everything in it. The Party of business? Really?

287 2018-10-06 23:14:15 @cpkimball Question, what do you do with the oil after you deep fry twice a year? I honestly believe if you want deep fry you go out for it. If you’re on a diet you can’t have deep fry more than twice a year. It has to be a treat. Let’s be honest we are all obese and it sucks.
288 2018-10-06 23:14:04 Thank you sweet OIL! ...and fucked up theocracies with patriarchy rule
289 2018-10-06 23:13:59 Alright. But then why switch from oil to an alternative like hydrogen? Just because oil will eventually be exhausted?

291 2018-10-06 23:13:08 FGN increased the charge on gas flared per 1000 SCF by 6000% for companies  with >10,000  bpd.

But this is a charge which makes it a business cost(allowable deduction) and not a penalty( disallowed deduction)

In simple terms: the oil companies pay to DPR and collect from FIRS

299 2018-10-06 23:12:16 The currency chosen is irrelevant; Scotland's credit rating will likely be AAA due to the fact that Scotland is the biggest oil producer in Europe. And the only UK country with a positive balance of payments. And the best educated population. And no debt (its' UK debt).
300 2018-10-06 23:11:59 I'm getting calls from friends in Florida and other US states, asking me where they can get some cannabis oil for medical applications.

The lack of knowledge will soon pass.

307 2018-10-06 23:10:59 The whole deal seems to be staged by Qatar, Turkey and whoever wants to cause a diplomatic crisis days before the Iran sanctions when Saudis promised to replace Iran oil as long as necessary. Saudis claim they have provided video of him leaving consulate to Turkish authorities

319 2018-10-06 23:09:41 More globalist 'nation-building'.  Gadaffi became enemy of Rockefellers when he nationalized Marathon oil 60 yrs ago after Rockefellers refused to pay Libya same as they paid Saudis. This automatically made him enemy of USA and of globalists world wide. Matter of time, really.

327 2018-10-06 23:08:50 How is this is a criticism of the Conservatives and not Trudeau? 

Trudeau building oil pipelines without changing NEB rules (as he promised) + still not being on track to meet our CO2 emission targets is a bad look. 

You're attacking the Cons from the right.

332 2018-10-06 23:08:30 Let's see how long the relationship lasts when the Saudi  Oil runs out? 80 years or 1 week???
333 2018-10-06 23:08:19 Just oiled the tables with pure natural hemp oil to cure over the long weekend.  The open pore finish is a bit more work, but so worth it!  We're feeling so thankful for everything that brought us here, and hope to see you when we reopen on Tuesday 
334 2018-10-06 23:08:03 It also fits nicely with a national security argument against oil dependency.

339 2018-10-06 23:06:37 I'd say we put on a good face, but the future of the country looked extremely grim in the 70s. Oil shocks. Decaying cities. Nixon. Thermonuclear war.
340 2018-10-06 23:06:37 I srsly love coming home. My Dad really took my car to get an oil change, filled it up with gas and stopped at chili’s to get me food. I didn’t even ask for any of this 
341 2018-10-06 23:06:30 As I recall it was mostly Saudis who flew planes into buildings, not Iranians. It’s all about oil, corruption and the Republican party.

Her logic, I just had to mix eggs in it. Um, you need oil and water too.
345 2018-10-06 23:06:08 cabbage, green onion, grated apple or fennel or both (can add other veg too!) dressing: sugar, red/white wine or apple cider vinegar, some kind of good mustard, caraway seeds, olive oil, salt, black pepper
346 2018-10-06 23:05:34 So lemme get this straight. The Saudis just straight up murdered a journalist inside their consulate after luring him there on false pretenses?

Why, other than oil (obviously), do we pretend that Saudi Arabia has redeeming features?

349 2018-10-06 23:05:18 Geothermal and tidal seem like better options for displacing coal and oil than wind. Hard to beat nuclear power for its safety record and carbon footprint, though.

We do have to be sure that waste is being properly managed, and isn't being foisted on indigenous people.

408 2018-10-06 22:57:37 also was excessive optimism going into 2015 -- thought was that oil price fall would power a massive consumer boom (in some sense a continuation of 2015) and thus no particular need to worry about drag from nx following USD appreciation + oil's impact on investment

439 2018-10-06 22:53:20 Been having a pain in my side like I pulled a muscle. Been in pain about a month. Nothing has worked. Until today. I am now a believer in #CBD oil.
440 2018-10-06 22:53:20 Don't know if you saw crude oil soaring to $76/barrel before settling in the $74/barrel range.
441 2018-10-06 22:53:20 Burn that midnight, I’m talking maybe oil or wax, but in the daytime, I’m only smoking papers or wraps.
442 2018-10-06 22:53:16 I want to live in a country where we think of the MEN who risk their lives every day to keep us safe. Also, MEN who bring electricity from the tops of Poles into your house. Please think about the men who’ve lost fingers drilling for oil that make our cars run well in LA.
443 2018-10-06 22:53:07 Bro ima need an oil change after this weekend
444 2018-10-06 22:52:58 批判と噂は別物
445 2018-10-06 22:52:48 Whenever i fry something my dumbass aries brain tells me i need more oil

I do not need more oil
446 2018-10-06 22:52:41 Surely #SnakeOil, as in oil from a snake, must have SOME practical use. I mean, it must be doing something for the #snake, right?
447 2018-10-06 22:52:29 Always the excuse. I heard that line of thinking in 2008 when mealie meal went missing from the shops, then bread and cooking oil. They blamed it on hoarding.. Yet everyone was in queues Saka who was hoarding.
448 2018-10-06 22:52:24 This guy really doesn’t know what next year means. We haven’t even tapped into the oil reserves in Texas you fucking idiot that’s why I said next year. Seriously just shutup now, even you know you sound retarded lmao. I literally said next year since tweet one 
449 2018-10-06 22:51:58 Snake oil has 'helped' people too.
450 2018-10-06 22:51:57 Or cheap oil either! 
451 2018-10-06 22:51:53 I always switch Siri’s voice from Aussie to English, I’m trying to find which one is sexier. Don’t judge me.

454 2018-10-06 22:51:05 Just gave my worktops a coat of oil before going to bed. Really hope no-one was looking through my windows when I was stood in my undies with latex gloves on.

456 2018-10-06 22:50:59 An inexhaustible good nature is one of the most precious gifts of  heaven, spreading itself like oil over the troubled sea of thought, and  keeping the mind smooth and equable in the roughest weather.

457 2018-10-06 22:50:57 On what grounds are you calling him a snake oil salesman? He's a great clinical psychologist with tens of thousands of hours of personal work done. He has tested his program thoroughly and it has shown resounding success. What's wrong with making some money for it?
458 2018-10-06 22:50:40 I dated a redhead once...never again. Us gingers clash like oil and water.

461 2018-10-06 22:50:19 私だって知り合って間もないから全てを信頼している訳じゃないけど、それでも全ての責任を負いつつ頑張ってることを知ってるから、事実と確定できない噂で批判されるのはあまりよく思わない
462 2018-10-06 22:50:16 If you charge for services, you're a snake oil salesman. Got it.
463 2018-10-06 22:50:13 Tomorrow he may say..

469 2018-10-06 22:49:29 I can’t do drip coffee pots. I’ve bought the wrong sized filters 2x and apparently don’t know about the ratios for coffee to water. This tastes like motor oil.

481 2018-10-06 22:48:18 Had to get an oil change today and am both embarrassed and appalled at how many empty water bottles I found (hint: more than 10, less than 100)

493 2018-10-06 22:46:09 While everyone is worried about this Kavanaugh thing don’t let that distract from the fact that th US continues to be supplied with an unlimited supply of half price oil on the world market by Canada because were fucking retarded

501 2018-10-06 22:44:53 I’ll need to find the card when I get home, but there’s a guy that always has a booth at all the art shows around town selling the same stuff. I’ve bought the CBD oil on multiple occasions.
502 2018-10-06 22:44:52 The @GOP would have to grow a pair to take any such action & that's far from likely given their history. 

If anything, it could go back to the SCOTUS which cause a ruling of "back to the states", which is how it should have been to begin with per the US Constitution.
503 2018-10-06 22:44:47 Have you used it? My snakes are getting a little dry and Big Snake Oil has the box stores full of their inferior imported snake oil. It's usually half soy oil and that's not good for snakes.
504 2018-10-06 22:44:38 Best fast food chicken sandwich I’ve had, at any rate.

Fries are interesting too. I’m not sure if they air fry or only use super clean oil but it’s a notable difference.

512 2018-10-06 22:43:51 He’d give Murkowski to Russia, but not Alaska. Alaska is red on his beloved electoral map, and it has oil.

I don't think so, I think it's traders jumping on something that's going up
523 2018-10-06 22:41:59 Here's an interesting though. The crown prince is not a despot. Yes he is brutal. However, its a monarchy and thats HOW that works. Especially since it the center of islam. The crown prince doesnt want to rely on oil so he is diversifying. He also despises globalists
524 2018-10-06 22:41:50 No interest in that type of player .

563 2018-10-06 22:35:39 Saudis emirs was payed by UK to fight against Ottomans and spread  pan-arabism as main ideology. There were no oil during this period.

ending our alliance with saudi arabia means billions of investments in american companies will have to be dealt with

ending our alliance with saudi arabia means modern finance will change
579 2018-10-06 22:33:09 brainstorming how KSA is setting out 25% oil to the people around the globe. unmatched reserves. #TicTocNews
580 2018-10-06 22:32:59 @RealRodParsley is nothing more than a snake oil salesman who twists Gods Word to milk people of their money.  If we were in Old Testament times he would have been taken out and stoned by now.
He is a #FalseTeacher avoid him.
581 2018-10-06 22:32:43 So I'm in the car with my mom and....well......the car needs an oil change so we're stuck on the freeway 
582 2018-10-06 22:32:40 He met crude oil price at its peak period, you forgot to add
583 2018-10-06 22:32:30 Turaki is just going to waste delegates votes.
584 2018-10-06 22:32:27 I would rather be boiled in oil
585 2018-10-06 22:32:24 I woke up foggy but watching the oil get their show run chippered me right up. Watching them get obliterated after the preseason hype is a perfect prefix to the panthers season opener and mcgregor fight!
586 2018-10-06 22:32:19 Looks more like"A man of the coal, oil and gas" look. It's a bit of a long winded look.
587 2018-10-06 22:31:58 Where? Do these people listening actually buy the snake oil being sold or are they just so gullible they’ll believe anything. 
I walk the streets of this “DIVIDED NATION” daily yet see no evidence of the strife they claim is so rampant.
It’s still America out here and it’s good.
588 2018-10-06 22:31:57 This week, I have had to change: the AC in my car, the brakes, the tires, the wiper blades, and the oil. The oil was due. The rest of it is just my car falling apart at one time.  Oh and the brake line. 
589 2018-10-06 22:31:54 いい引きですね！！
羨ましい！！！ほんとに！！！
590 2018-10-06 22:31:52 I just bought a cool new CD/cassette tape player! Our tax money is used to buy fancy appetizers for political parties! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
591 2018-10-06 22:31:51 fun fact they put offshore oil drilling and vaping indoors on the same amendment because theyre fucking awful bastards
592 2018-10-06 22:31:42 None of us are oil paintings but.....
593 2018-10-06 22:31:35 Going to war with Iraq for oil was slightly worse...
594 2018-10-06 22:31:34 @Casablancas_J tonight is the superbowl of music and people don’t even know it, do I smell xerox in our future or is that just the oil refineries?
595 2018-10-06 22:31:22 whats snake oil about it?
596 2018-10-06 22:31:18 You're no snake oil salesman. But your stance on Kavanagh goes against everything you've ever said. Literally all of it. So you must understand if we are feeling betrayed.
597 2018-10-06 22:31:13 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.
598 2018-10-06 22:30:58 The army loves the stupid grunt but not as much as the patriotic religious indoctrinated piss poor Scottish Sandbag.

I no longer do the poppy thing, its one thing to fight a war against an aggressor on our doorstep, bombing our civilians, but another thing for the oil dollar.

600 2018-10-06 22:30:51 How could it be possible 
When under GEJ administration crude oil price was $120 per barrel 
And buhari came on board when it was 40 and now $85 per barrel 
Do you really know the meaning of earnings? And how to compare the stats very well??
601 2018-10-06 22:30:48 OR YOU CAN HAVE A DREAM ABOUT DROWNING IN OIL
602 2018-10-06 22:30:41 CHINA HAS REMOVED ITS 25% TARIFF ON OIL

605 2018-10-06 22:30:32 Am not buying the alleged murder of Jamal Khashoggi. For one, it's out a day after BBG's interview of MBS, where Jamal was discussed. 2nd, it's coming from a pretty unreliable source; Erdogan's regime. He talks a lot. Kicked out Israeli ambassador, but delivers oil to Israel.
606 2018-10-06 22:30:19 But also my hormones were super outta whack earlier this year with my chronic pain and adjusting my medications contributed a lot as well I think. OH and I use the shu uemura cleansing oil every night to remove my make up lmao
607 2018-10-06 22:30:06 I have recently relied on cbd oil for the days when my anxiety meds are not enough. It really does help me but it's not available in all states unfortunately, despite being THC free.
608 2018-10-06 22:30:04 Having purchased this incredibly inexpensive program, I'd have to say if he was selling snake oil he's not getting rich off it.
609 2018-10-06 22:30:02 honestly, coconut oil is God’s gift
610 2018-10-06 22:30:00 My mom's PC is literally full of oil.
611 2018-10-06 22:29:57 It took the move @lisamurkowski pulled to make me say “yes” I’d vote Sarah in 2022. Troopergate was for real and messing with oil co taxes was a massive mistake but tremendously PALES in comparison to watching @lisamurkowski commit the unpardonable sin today
612 2018-10-06 22:29:51 ...y’all 

Me (calling wing stop) what kind of oil do you fry yours wings in?

Her: Grease

Me: (laughing inside) Yes I know but is it peanut oil, vegetable oil, canola oil, or something else

Her: Idk *yells back and asks the cook*

Cook: Canola

Her: Granola

614 2018-10-06 22:29:03 if you thought you had hobbies, I just reviewed an applicant whose hobbies include stain glass window fabrication, metal casting, building a furnace that uses recycled vegetable oil to cast said metal, Psyanky egg decorating, sourdough bread baking, charcoal drawing & carpentry.

619 2018-10-06 22:28:08 For a variety of reasons, I haven’t been covering @IndyEleven as much as I did In previous seasons. But, as we embark on our final game at Lucas Oil this season, a couple of thoughts about how things have gone - 

1. This year was always going to be tough. From agreeing to play
620 2018-10-06 22:27:57 焦げしいたけさん
621 2018-10-06 22:27:56 Oh yes, I always make friends with a gang that jumps me in the alley, because it was my fault for walking there stupid me.

And I’m heating up oil to the flash point to drop on that alley when the gang comes back, hands outstretched, for a shake.
622 2018-10-06 22:27:55 Kurds chose to join with the US against Syria to try and steal half of Syria (the most oil rich land) with US backing to create their own “Kurdistan.” Killing Syria’s sons and daughters that make up the SAA backed by American greed was their own stupid choice. Karma is a bitch.
623 2018-10-06 22:27:53 As a student (1986) I once boiled some rashers repeatedly in a kettle, as the gas bottle was empty and there was no pan, not to mind oil or lard. God bless the ESB.

627 2018-10-06 22:27:36 My fave comparison was prosperity gospel

tRump is an uglierJoel Osteen who gets poor ppl to donate to his gold paint prosperity. Only people getting richer are the snake oil salesmen, not the rubes

I may need to work on that analogy, but I’m sure u got it 
628 2018-10-06 22:27:27 Can you smoke a gram of oil by yourself in one sitting?
629 2018-10-06 22:27:21 many years ago I saw some porn on tumbrl with a guy who had a tattoo that looked like oil spreading up his body from his dick & I thought of Venom

Money money money money MON-NEH!!
633 2018-10-06 22:26:48 Nice Jeffery, you don't believe the price of oil has bearing on corporate decisions for huge capital projects. Looking through a rearview lens also is distorted. Being rude and name calling is a finished conversation. Have a nice life.

a) link my statement to racism so may be offended by something

You may need to research the history of use of cannibis oil.

639 2018-10-06 22:26:03 Made this the other day.  Califlower nachos.  Chopped a head of califlower, roasted it for 20 minutes after coating with olive oil.  Then you can use either ground turkey or veggie beef crumbles browned with onions  on top.  Then add a  cheddar cheese ,salsa and sour cream.

643 2018-10-06 22:24:42 This Texan wants a strong economy! Texans in oil, plants and manufacturing were killed under the last admin. With over regulations rolled back the same plants are now hiring!!! This is no joke! My husbands job was laying off many people and now are hiring. Ted is best for Texas!
644 2018-10-06 22:24:37 Have you tried CBD oil? Just curious because I am contemplating trying it. No TCH is in it. IDK I am just tired of dealing with this. I want the old me back.
645 2018-10-06 22:24:25 By this time next year, Texas is gonna be the third largest oil producer in the world only behind Saudi and Russia. To all my Texas fam, we all about to be eating hella good 
646 2018-10-06 22:24:22 The Iraqi Christians too were under attack during the US invasion and occupation. Churches were burned and looted. The Americans did nothing. Same thing with the Palestinian Christians. The West cares more about Oil.

659 2018-10-06 22:22:12 Is it a salesman’s mission to screw over every girl when going in for an oil change? 

I don’t want anything else. just a fucking oil change. I am not stupid.

665 2018-10-06 22:21:40 CBD oil seems to be all the rage right now, but I don’t understand what it actually does. Is it for physical pain, emotional pain, anxiety, all of the above? Have you tried it? I do understand it doesn’t get you high. Also supposedly not addictive.

669 2018-10-06 22:21:30 There is always a return in every investment. Why do you really think people love Zimbabwe so much. That country is rich. Right now if exploration is done properly we have a lot of undiscovered deposits of minerals, recently prospects of oil and best farming land.

678 2018-10-06 22:19:35 can someone explain why CBD oil has the grossest taste in the world
679 2018-10-06 22:19:30 @AlanPeppard Hi Alan: I'm a historian at UVA interested in Clint Murchison (Jr) and LBJ. I read your great piece Islands of the Oil Kings. Would you be willing to chat about Dallas history sometime?

686 2018-10-06 22:18:26 Stubborn they are ! Beware as they can develop into nasty infections. My little one had them on inside of leg by the knee. Transferred to opposite leg, same place, then became painfully infected. Tea tree oil helped soothe but unfortunately needed antibiotics

694 2018-10-06 22:17:30 That’s the first half-bright point you’ve made. People ARE abandoning the sinking ship of so-called oil alternatives; as the bright and shiny promise of electric cars and solar powered grids meets the hard reality of Northern winters and base load demand.

715 2018-10-06 22:13:47 Oh Dont believe it. They’re still up Obamas butt. Oil, you know keeps him ticking. Lost all respect for all Bushes except Laura.
716 2018-10-06 22:13:46 LMAO! You’re an idiot kid, by this time next year Texas is gonna be providing more oil than countries in the Middle East. 3rd in the world. Do your research, you’re hella ignorant.

718 2018-10-06 22:13:38 Umm... we're already allocated geographic share of oil taxation revenue, so we'd get as much as we're getting now. If we're a rich company, why is our expenditure so much greater than our revenue? What cuts would Indy Scotland make to balance this situation?
719 2018-10-06 22:13:35 Sir, same was the problem during Congress regime. In 2008 the price of crude oil per barrel was $145 and petrol and Diesel were sold at a rate lower than present rate. Now the price per barrel is $85 or $90.
720 2018-10-06 22:13:31 Frying in non animal oil I hope!
721 2018-10-06 22:13:27 When the world runs out of oil #60Mins will be there to scrap the bottom of the barrel with the Stormy Daniels interview
722 2018-10-06 22:13:01 Not a lot of positives to come out of game 1 for the Oil.  NJ dominated them with their speed.  Oilers had no answer today.
Good news is it's one game.  Lots to fix but they have all kinds of time.

731 2018-10-06 22:10:49 try lavender oil..
732 2018-10-06 22:10:47 Just because they are our allies it doesnt mean they have ever been good. They funded the groups that produced the 9/11 terrorists and the Taliban. It has always been about oil and political expediency.
733 2018-10-06 22:10:45 i cant believe youd say something as dumb as this... i guess you genuinely dont know where oil comes from

736 2018-10-06 22:10:12 I have s9s and we have taken them apart, taken coolers off(to run them on oil) and some of the math we did did not add up. Still, running them on oil and a different firmware gives you 20 teras so im happy with that

741 2018-10-06 22:09:52 @WrestlingSoup @iamjondraper This whole WWE taking Saudi money reminds me of those instagram girls proudly taking diarrhea dumps on their faces for Dubai oil princes and getting good money for it. They called those chicks "Dubai porta potties". WWE 2018 is the Saudi Porta Potty?
742 2018-10-06 22:09:42 imagining a guy who ran out of olive oil so he uses old spice body spray on his frying pan like its pam
743 2018-10-06 22:09:42 Apparently ships carrying oil from Canada to other countries spent as safe as all those ships bringing oil to Canada.
744 2018-10-06 22:09:00 If we embargo Saudi oil, the world would effectively no longer need the dollar, and that alone could trigger a worldwide financial crisis... just saying. Also, it should go without saying, but everyone is unhinged now; to be clear I’m not defending the murder of journalists.

747 2018-10-06 22:08:47 So, KSA rejected that they were holding Khashoggi because they MURDERED him instead. The repercussions should be harsh. Complete boycott of KSA oil, cessation of all military cooperation, and a worldwide diplomatic freeze on all of their personnel abroad.
748 2018-10-06 22:08:46 They already got it.. they mine it, sell drugs for it. Buy oil with it to get around the blockades..
As for mainstream adoption imho I’d suggest either Ltc, Etc, Xlm as the people would rather use a more realistically priced token/coin.

773 2018-10-06 22:04:28 Canola oil is not and can never be called "organic". There is no such thing as a canola plant. Canadians genetically modified the rapeseed plant to remove a part that was unsafe for human consumption, and are trying to fool people that it is safe because they call it organic.

784 2018-10-06 22:02:06 No way that will happen.
9/11 was committed by a group of mostly Saudi terrorists. 
Didn't harm the US-Saudi relationship at all.
They can do no wrong, as long as they're sitting on a pile of oil.

790 2018-10-06 22:00:56 Barney almond butter closest to the texture of regular peanutbutter. It's not soupy and oily. But it does have sugar, palm oil and salt. For me nut butters are a recipe not just grinding up nuts and putting them in a jar. But that's just me.
791 2018-10-06 22:00:50 I tried to tell my friend how cool I was for checking my own oil and then I accidentally said dick stick and negated everything I was trying to accomplish
792 2018-10-06 22:00:44 #crayonresist When kinders see me painting over oil pastels or crayons and the colors jumping through the watercolor??? They are gobsmacked. Also older students love blending (successfully) chalk pastels. I am a K-6 teacher of geniuses

794 2018-10-06 22:00:26 Yup.  All it took was a collapse of USD v oil from $10 to $150.  Directionally similar (if not magnitude) will have to happen to USD v existing world industrial base currencies (EUR, CNY, JPY) to make it work.
795 2018-10-06 22:00:18 Oil and billion dollar arms deals and the poor journalist will be quickly forgotten.
796 2018-10-06 22:00:16 Actually it is the petrodollar. It is the sale of oil and making sure all OPEC oil sales are in the dollar. So that the whole world needs to use USD to buy oil.
797 2018-10-06 22:00:15 Look slowly ... take it in.... eight refineries refining scots oil! Jobs, revenue, all lost to Scotland!

804 2018-10-06 21:59:06 It is said that the #Cameroon regime of dictator #PaulBiya embezzled in this year $300 Mill. from oil revenues alone. We pity all those young East Camerounians who were deceived all the time.
805 2018-10-06 21:59:04 We’d have to move towards more energy independence, but that’s been a goal of every administration since we became oil dependent.
806 2018-10-06 21:58:35 U need thieves!!!!! (Essential oil)
807 2018-10-06 21:58:25 Lmao well, there was a post on IG few months back about the children of some oil billionaire dragging her , talking about snatching their father

812 2018-10-06 21:57:34 “America has reclaimed its throne atop the oil world. For the first time since 1973, the U.S. is the world’s largest producer of crude oil.”

So, explain again why we’re still using food to make ethanol? Stop using olden ‘Oil Crisis’ to force us to buy corn-ethanol we don’t need!

863 2018-10-06 21:50:14 OMG. Not again. No I don’t agree with getting rid of it! Just like I don’t agree with being exposed to radiation and mercury., Coal contaminated water, digging for oil or coal or gas in parks and water and endangered pristine areas. This whole government is just insane.
864 2018-10-06 21:50:05 Something about I had to pay to get a sludge treatment or something  My fiancé told me to pay for it because the oil hadn’t been changed in awhile. But believe me I was mad I had to pay that much
865 2018-10-06 21:50:05 Worse yet, we import their oil.

881 2018-10-06 21:48:16 Westminster has taken 92% of scots oil revenues for 50 years and still near bankrupted the country.
882 2018-10-06 21:47:48 I mean what’s the point?? I think it’s all flesh no oil  lol
883 2018-10-06 21:47:31 Palm oil can break your back they gave it to,my mom at Illinois hospital in Chicago make your own food and make it bland
884 2018-10-06 21:47:28 Kwankwaso said he wants to apologize to their former administration and that this is the worst govt in the history of Nigeria.
885 2018-10-06 21:47:22 Well, depends who you talk to. Courts have said that there is not enough consultation with First Nations. Oil people say that consultation should be minimal because national interest.

First Nations are divided! Because they are semi-sovereign entities with their own interests.
886 2018-10-06 21:47:14 Me ordering a large popcorn:

Do you want extra butter on top?

Is it actually butter, what exactly is it?

It's like a soybean oil thing

Oh, no definitely not.

*gets me large popcorn*

Is the butter that comes popped on it the same stuff?

Yes.

Fuck, ok that's fine.

888 2018-10-06 21:47:05 $ to stay strong

Fed unwinding $500 bn in 2018, $600 bn from 2019 onwards, impacts supply of $.

Trade tariffs & higher oil price creates incrementally higher demand for $.

To maintain the market share, export oriented EM countries might depreciate currency.

889 2018-10-06 21:47:02 Of course your Cabela’s wish list is completely not oil dependent. I will donate, if you go back to the land and live like your ancestors.  @GasBuddyDan What do you think the chances are?
890 2018-10-06 21:46:32 Don't have time for fans of small teams with oil money!
891 2018-10-06 21:46:30 He thinks he's a very important thing. He's going down. The snake oil salesman will be imprisoned.
892 2018-10-06 21:46:27 Food from Russia won’t be enough. Not sure that oil and nat gas would be enough even assuming China doesn’t have to compete with removed European embargo’s on Russia and European demand.
893 2018-10-06 21:46:26 Coconut oil is comogenic, use olive, grapeseed or avocado oil. Do not use this product. Chemical burns, death of tissue cells and blood vessels is nothing to gamble with, use lemon, honey, turmeric as natural lighteners and brighteners. This woman cares nothing about your safety
894 2018-10-06 21:46:24 This bulletproof coffee and MCT Oil is NO JOKE 
895 2018-10-06 21:46:19 “Can I use some of that oil over there” like its community property....how do you know I have oil over here?

897 2018-10-06 21:45:49 I'm going to buy some 3-in1 oil, rags, apples, and do some sword cutting I think, I need a constructive way to blow off steam
898 2018-10-06 21:45:34 Go oil go!!!!!
899 2018-10-06 21:45:24 This is thrash. Oil was trading at 17 -20 dollars when OBJ became president. OBJ inherited 3billion dollars in foreign reserves,Yet no recession,. PMB inherited 30B in reserves n oil @ over 50$.Yet the dinosaur plunged us into recession like he did in 1984
900 2018-10-06 21:45:22 @RingelsteinME is running. He’s not going to accept $ from big oil, cooperations and lobbyists. He’s progressive and cares about our environment.
901 2018-10-06 21:45:19 Well done.. u have just identified one of the reasons why Scotland needs to be independent and why we could easily support ourselves in the future.. All OIL revenue currently goes to Westminster and not to Scotland.. we get a wee trickle back to keep us quiet but QUIET no longer
902 2018-10-06 21:45:18  I love it. Your team, Manager and owners are that much of a joke, all United fans can talk about is Empty seats and Oil. I've dreamed of these days 
903 2018-10-06 21:44:58 Some days there just aren’t enough words. Or lavender essential oil. Or tissues. But tomorrow will come and tomorrow will be better
904 2018-10-06 21:44:56 What a sh*t show! Not a good start! This will never work in America! Oil and water doesn't mix!

906 2018-10-06 21:44:54 There's some well deserved blowback going now about how the Trudeau government is prioritizing First Nations peoples versus oil rights too, as I understand
907 2018-10-06 21:44:50 I want to oil her tits up
908 2018-10-06 21:44:49 There are  9 billion to 10 billion people on our planet and a hand full of Politicians that want MONEY WAR OIL if you ask the 10 Billion people of the world they will say NO to WAR we are in 2018 time to take a stand for your FUTURE  10 Billion against a hand full of IDIOTS
909 2018-10-06 21:44:27 Was the system any different during upa? 
Don't give excuses, accept that upa handled the price rice better 

Note :
Upa crude oil -$140
Nda crude oil -$ 84

913 2018-10-06 21:43:21 I once got my car up to 80 mph on the highway... got the usual oil warning light... most men would have been frightened but I made it to my local convenience store without incident.
914 2018-10-06 21:43:00 OMG I can’t Rn!!!! Oil saying in Josh’s insta story that joe soooo loves Dianne right now!!! Tonight my childhood is loving life !! #teamjoanne #BBCStrictly

I have the interweb.
919 2018-10-06 21:42:21 Bollocks, I have maybe 20m2 of my 1600m2 lawn left to mow (and it was feral!), and now long-suffering mower has a) very bent front axle, 2) broken plastic housing and perhaps most fatally/importantly 3) is pissing oil all over the place. This is not tremendous. #RIPMower
920 2018-10-06 21:42:02 It would be nice to get the campaign version of Donald Trump re: Saudi Arabia rather than the current version. Sadly, oil may still be important enough to the world economy to where SA can create a global recession.
921 2018-10-06 21:41:57 The brighter side of this is that the pussy hat crowd have managed to waddle their gross anatomy outside to actually get some exercise.
Tomorrow the air will be filled with a mix of ben-gay and pertulli oil
922 2018-10-06 21:41:44 PMB will win and enter his second term with oil trending above $80.

There will be no excuses.
923 2018-10-06 21:41:40 I have both cbd oil & thc med mj they're definitely helpful.
924 2018-10-06 21:41:28 Oil is made from dead dinosaurs 
925 2018-10-06 21:41:17 It’s all about the cash 
926 2018-10-06 21:41:11 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
927 2018-10-06 21:41:11 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
928 2018-10-06 21:41:10 Sitting at the car dealer and waiting on my oil change, and this dude is flipping channels on the TV like he’s I his couch at home.
929 2018-10-06 21:41:09 This asshat probably responded while drinking a starbucks coffee, not even realizing that without oil that cup of starbucks wasn't even possible.
930 2018-10-06 21:41:07 Blimey! What was in there? I told you your chilli oil was too hot.....
931 2018-10-06 21:41:07 Similar, but no it’s not. A humidifier just releases moisture into the air and a diffuser releases cold air with the oil. Putting oil in an humidifier could damage it
932 2018-10-06 21:41:05 Check the price of cooking oil and tell me my brother. All is not well I tell u
933 2018-10-06 21:40:55 It's really easy to catch on fire in Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Must be using too much oil on the skin. #firebad #Odyssey
934 2018-10-06 21:40:50 Tay Keith help me change my oil.
935 2018-10-06 21:40:30 I bought $150 shoes so I could get free shipping on $9 face oil. Don't @ me.
936 2018-10-06 21:40:28 And yet you STILL failed. Maybe that shows that your message is more bullshit than the ones you are protesting against. But what would I know....right? Dying breath? Watch tv in november..ill bet theres another gasp. U r con artists and snake oil peddlers.

940 2018-10-06 21:39:46 Shea moisture castor oil leave in
941 2018-10-06 21:39:39 Don’t try and sell her. She’s a Trump stooge. She got the easy out because Collins agreed to take the hit. LM is garbage who does anything for oil.
942 2018-10-06 21:38:44 I strongly suspect that both Trudeau and Horgan have secret off shore bank accounts and all those oil companies have the numbers, how else can one explain their decisions, unless they are morons of course.
943 2018-10-06 21:38:28 Bomin: I need to sleep before 12 o'clock for tomorrow's practice 

Other kids his age: Burning the midnight oil to study for the entrance exam 

Well he's a 'genius' who will own woollim in the future thus he's 'not worried' about the exams 
944 2018-10-06 21:38:15 Then I brought it in at 9:00am to get an oil change and it still ain’t done yet
945 2018-10-06 21:38:12 This Otunbaola's mumu issue reminds me of one broke I broke during the oil subsidy strike in 2012 or thereabout. One lady-friend gave me two raps of moin-moin, one cup of garri and two sachets of pure water for lunch. She went to tell my ex who was a classmate I beg around. LOL
946 2018-10-06 21:38:05 Is Kool Aid an essential oil?
947 2018-10-06 21:37:59 Learn to discern the snake oil humans from worthy practiioners, please.
948 2018-10-06 21:37:50 Avenatti had always struck me as a snake oil salesman and the Julie Swetnick interview was pointless.  Did not expect all of this though.  Found his escapades on Wikipedia, thanks for the information.

958 2018-10-06 21:37:17 So your suggestion is leave the oil in the ground ? I just wanna clarify, you are in favor of NO "fossil" fuel at all? ZERO , NADA, ZILCH NONE ?|  Am I understanding this correctly? You promote a world with NO petroleum usage at all ???
959 2018-10-06 21:37:11 Garbage service, the government needs to stop giving money to these snake oil salesmen with friends high up.
960 2018-10-06 21:37:00 So WSJ is unaware but....you are? Just saying, it seems someone believes they know exactly what’s happening in the markets as if he has hands in the global oil markets
961 2018-10-06 21:36:56 To be honest, I personally don't give a toss about who the 'biggest club' is. I'm just happy that I watch the best team. And so long as that continues I'm not arsed if I'm the only person in the stadium and our owners build an oil well in the car park to finance the club. Okay?
962 2018-10-06 21:36:52 their BB keys are in there too...I saw Kaitlyn's pics of what was in hers & it was a medicine bottle (Kaitlyn Oil) from OTEV, her key & a big brother t-shirt.

964 2018-10-06 21:36:35 Hope you also factored in the petrol subsidy, as price of oil increases in the international market so does the landing cost of petrol increases. So whatever money the govt makes is already lost. We need to remove the subsidy but will Nigerians accept this?
965 2018-10-06 21:36:29 That’s a whole avocado my brother with sea salt & Olive oil. Blesssed.

968 2018-10-06 21:36:16 Period 2 was a typical McLellan Oilers kind of period. Tied 1-1, so sit back. You have play every game, every period and every shift with urgency. Tactics is one thing but a coach has to find away to maximize input from  players. I’ve been saying this for years: McLellan can’t

972 2018-10-06 21:35:45 @LinusTech If you tried the sub zero cooler on the 2080 ti bench mark video on a pc submerged in mineral oil would that get rid of the condensation problems or would it still cause a moisture issue?
973 2018-10-06 21:35:43 The only thing I’m worried about is rats tbh. I’ll die if I see one. Lol but besides that i be ready and once we leave I’m jumping in a bath full of blessed oil and holy water

Look at Oil&Gas reforms that OBJ started, continued with PUY/Rilwan Lukman, where is it today? 
What did the Minister with five GMDs do? Was the law passed?

Now Minister says his power reduced, not that it’s bad!

Harder pill to swallow - if you do know a lot about politics, it may be just as bad, if not worse, than just being ignorant. It’s a sad time

Hardest pill to swallow - fish oil pills

993 2018-10-06 21:32:36 The 2010 anniversary cuvée from @GloriaFerrer is incredible on the nose w/ overripe peaches, almond oil & orange pastille on the nose. Silky, creamy texture but perfect balance of acidity and fine bubbles. Can’t pair but recommended is  and scallop w/Meyer lemon aioli #wbc18
994 2018-10-06 21:32:30 So, @lydibug_13, who's always been a "tiny house" person, just said she needs to marry into oil after seeing the Marland Mansion.
995 2018-10-06 21:32:25 Did Gary just say "you can feel your olive oil"?
996 2018-10-06 21:32:21 We used to need them, or their oil. Now, why?
997 2018-10-06 21:32:19 Oh, yeah, the monthly gem thing is mainly for the oil. The gems are sort of a bonus on top. The game doesn't hand out many gems, but given that gems are used exclusively for infrastructure and costumes it's really not a big deal.
998 2018-10-06 21:32:15 I swear by that fancy witch hazel for your face. I started testosterone almost a year ago and it totally messed up my face but witch hazel set it back to a manageable range of oil

1002 2018-10-06 21:31:43 okay, so I just put a little bit of tea tree oil on a pimple like 5 minutes ago. AND I AM SHOOK. IT’S GONE. LITERALLY! Wow ! This is a god sent.

1006 2018-10-06 21:31:29 i miss working with @ericammmiller because i could do things like slap her with a piece of lunch meat or squirt her with the bottle of hoagie oil when she was complaining
1007 2018-10-06 21:31:28 And by ours he means big money and oil companies.

1009 2018-10-06 21:31:12 I grew up an oil brat and worked in "smells like money" for a few years. Global warming had not been fast enough in the industrial revolution for ppl  to notice within an 80 year life, and alternatives too costly.  I hope the Silicon age will save us. Ironic... a house of sand
1010 2018-10-06 21:30:51 God of GEJ came through after all. Barrel of crude oil price & rates:

Jonathan’s time 
$85.03 -N150 = N12,754 

Buhari’s time 
$85.03 -N361 = N30,695

Let’s hear Buhari & cohort excuse again. Nigeria slipping into another recession thanks to the president of d capital of poverty

1016 2018-10-06 21:29:58 My holy Grail is finding some popcorn, oil, butter, fake butter combination that taste exactly like movie theater popcorn. I would love to be able to do that at homes.

1018 2018-10-06 21:29:53 Oh yes he can- he has instructed his epa secretary to open refuges for drilling and Mining from Utah’s Crested Butte to Alaska’s Wilderness refuge. He likes fracking- oil drilling @ICC_Alaska

1021 2018-10-06 21:29:21 Tesla is noted for its electric cars but the most significant development may be in energy storage.  This will impact electric energy producers, oil producers and coal producers. Storing renewable energy has been the missing link.
1022 2018-10-06 21:29:18 Then pack it in. Remove Everything that uses oil from your life. Do not buy clothes, groceries as they are farmed and delivered using combustion engines. Anything plastic, metal or glass get rid of it. That house or apt you live in. Move out. Do your part.
1023 2018-10-06 21:28:54 So I took some CBD oil...

Bitch is this all I needed to not be in constant pain?!?
1024 2018-10-06 21:28:47 You gotta be kidding,, mortgaging the future? What's 100 billion between friends right? It's so past our future, I can't see 5 generations from now coming up with the money to pay this off. How many barrels of oil @$50.00 a barrel would pay off 100 Billion? Stop Equalization.
1025 2018-10-06 21:28:47 He was my driver after watching him spin in oil in first turn 1958 Indy 500. He sure didn’t disappoint.

1027 2018-10-06 21:28:25 Canada should make friends with California, Texas, Chicago, New York. one is high advance technology state, one is oil empire state, the rest are financial states. Canada should low the tariffs attract USA giants companies invest to Canada.
1028 2018-10-06 21:28:20 Please ask POTUS about gas & oil prices rising. IF we supposedly export more refined gas than we import, there is no reason for increased prices, and we should be self sufficient. Gasoline, along with heating oil prices, is hurting many regular & senior citizens on fixed incomes.
1029 2018-10-06 21:28:18 I love truffle oil now too

1032 2018-10-06 21:27:58 Going back to occupy there does seem to be a professional protestor class that's been assembled. The tactics have been getting more violent and targeted at individuals more and more opposed toinstitutions.  This is just one battle in an escalating conflict.
1033 2018-10-06 21:27:55 Article ignores the lack of China ability to maintain supply lines in any war be it with the US or more likely Japan or Taiwan. Oil would be cut off easily and quickly. As to a lesser extent food would.

1035 2018-10-06 21:27:35 “We must not inter-marry with the Negro. Why? If I were to marry a Negro woman and have children by her, my children would oil be cursed as to the priesthood. There isn't any argument, therefore, as to inter-marriage with the Negro, is there?” —Apostle Mark E. Peterson

The news retweeted below exposes how incompetent most oil pundits really are. They only assumed a serious supply disruption would be coming but totally ignored other positive factors. Such a lack of visions is more than enough for them to quit or to be fired.
1039 2018-10-06 21:26:51 The Goldsheet releases another stellar Key Release UNLV -9 vs New Mexico.  Currently the score is New Mexico 29 UNLV 0 at half. HOW BAD CAN ONE HANDICAPPING SERVICE BE?  Fire somebody. This is a joke. @thegoldsheet

1041 2018-10-06 21:25:52 I'm out getting an oil change for the war wagon today. I looked around and had found a Jiffy Lube about 20 miles away, but my wife found a local shop 10 miles away, and said, "Their ad says LGBTQ-friendly."

"Right in the ad?"

"Yep!"

"Sold!"

1055 2018-10-06 21:22:59 Actually, include black peper in your diet, add fruits and use Olive oil too. Don't forget to try to eat organic meals always, forget fried meals too.
1056 2018-10-06 21:22:56 United fans seeing what Chelsea fans knew three years ago. Matic only has a left foot and turns like an oil tanker. Totally over priced and over rated.

1062 2018-10-06 21:21:57 FG used loans to pay salary till this administration and even the debt relief we had under OBJ wasn't enough with Nigeria owing lots even during oil boom. Loads has been embezzled massively and to prosecute them politics holds us back

1066 2018-10-06 21:21:31 Jordan, for someone I respect and who has most certainly been in the thick of it, I'm not getting a sense here that you grasp how far gone some of these people are. Appeasement and the mob = oil & water.
1067 2018-10-06 21:21:30 I prefer water..
.
Or hot chocolate....

Or milk........

Or a fat barrel of raw oil!

Btw this is My alt acc, i got locked cuz IM not old enought even tho i am. Twitter big fund Dumbo lol xddd lit fam
1068 2018-10-06 21:21:24 I think that the video should take into consideration of how big oil companies could have affected the evolution of cars. I find it hard to believe why we didn’t countinue the development of electrical cars and instead choose combustion engines (which are more complex)
1069 2018-10-06 21:21:10 he says several times he fights extremism, but it's wrong, for the good reason that Iran is accused to be behind terrorism of WTC attacks and ISIS. All he says is just lie. With USA they sanction Iran and Saudi Arabia sells oil that Iran can't trade. All is done to destroy Iran.
1070 2018-10-06 21:21:08 So if he was doing something that was forbidden. I think someone would have said something! It's possible it is glove conditioning oil..Hot Oil...

1081 2018-10-06 21:19:52 Yea you need to use oil just use butter after they are done
1082 2018-10-06 21:19:43 IMO the previous government greatly abandoned their duties by not investing when we had the cash, and relying too heavily on oil revenues; a fiscal and social debt they put on future generations.

1091 2018-10-06 21:18:35 Part of an education is learning how to discern truth from falsehood.  The grievance studies are one thing, the hard sciences another, and medicine is essential.  I'm assuming you prefer credentialed medical practice vs snake oil.
1092 2018-10-06 21:18:33 Well when the TMX is finally built, then Canadian oil and gas won't be landlocked anymore.
Same goes for the Canadian LNG plant in Kittimat. 
Until then, our oil and gas IS landlocked.

1096 2018-10-06 21:17:42 Was not the only clandestine with the Iran oil export, that half of the quantity was carried by Iranian ships that turned off the AIS?
1097 2018-10-06 21:17:34 My mom tried oil today and now she hooked
1098 2018-10-06 21:17:25 Canada is a pretty shit country compared to America and once all those car production companies move to Mexico, cost of living gonna go up even more and yalls dollar is gonna be worth even less whilst us here in Texas are gonna start exporting oil living da good life
1099 2018-10-06 21:17:15 It's a child's fantasy to believe the Senate is democratic. Midwestern senators represent more oil rigs and cows than voters.

1103 2018-10-06 21:16:39 Thanks to the grit truck spraying at speed after the oil spill. I now have new car full of chips on the paintwork and an 8 inch crack across my windscreen. The speed and amount of hard stonesfrim the grit truck meant it was  avoidable. This is costing me a a lot to repair.

1110 2018-10-06 21:15:55 Trump’s policies have nothing to do with inflation?  Dude, his trade wars are inflationary; his Iran sanctions are driving oil higher, which is inflationary; his hugely unpopular tax cut for the donor class is inflationary. Trump’s dismal approval ratings will only go lower.

1113 2018-10-06 21:15:50 Not drinking, but I almost wish I was after that SCJ vote. CBD oil might help!  Pizza and movie & Saturday Night Live. Should be interesting! xoxo
1114 2018-10-06 21:15:42 When I comes to oil I don't miss much it was easy to predict a significant raise in prices if GOP got in I told everyone I knew to throw money at it- Iran will simply sell their cheap conventional oil at a higher price to the rest of the world while we pay more 4 fuel of course
1115 2018-10-06 21:15:39 Sorros is probably pissed he paid all that money for nothing!

1126 2018-10-06 21:13:14 @SETrunkRoads my car was badly damaged by the lorry dealing with the oil spill. The "grit" firing out stones at speed has completely cracked my windscreen. Left chips over my front grill and paintwork. Spraying copious stones costing me a lot. Who can i take this up with?

And our oil and gas is most certainly landlocked.
Roads and rail don't ship our product to the world market.
1137 2018-10-06 21:11:20 You can fry some garlic or shallots in a little oil and then splash some ramen broth in the pan to scrape out the garlic/shallots into the broth.

Also try bringing the broth to a boil and dropping the egg in raw, popping the yolk and swirling it in.
1138 2018-10-06 21:10:52 Again msm hyping the preseason record, again oil thinking they are better than anyone
1139 2018-10-06 21:10:49 Why does my face always feel high after I use coconut oil to remove makeup
1140 2018-10-06 21:10:45 Try and google what the loan he requested is for. Also even oil states collecting 13% derivatives still owe salaries and some even collect bailouts. Yes funds have been mismanaged and at a point even Nigeria borrowed to pay salaries. He shot himself with that statement though
1141 2018-10-06 21:10:36 I understand you but it is not done like that. 
Do you expect government to export crude oil, collect money in dollars and come back to Nigeria to convert it to Naira?
1142 2018-10-06 21:10:33 Don't worry, John. I can imagine her days are definitely numbered. She is a snake and 45's snake oil is not working for people with brains.

1147 2018-10-06 21:09:58 Oil from Canada isn't landlocked either. We have several pipelines including all the existing rail and road infrastructure that all our other products seems to be able to thrive with.

Canada has also surpassed all records of production and sales
1148 2018-10-06 21:08:39 Or you can do what I’m doing with my day off: getting an oil change, my tires rotated, and my car smogged
1149 2018-10-06 21:08:35 Kevin are following a oil free diet?
1150 2018-10-06 21:08:17 This is far acceptable than two balls onions, a sachet of power oil and 4 cubes of maggi

1152 2018-10-06 21:08:00 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.
1153 2018-10-06 21:07:59 I don’t think anyone believes this message. You saddled us w/ carbon tax & red tape promising we’d get pipelines built. Turns out your friends like Tzeporah Berman only cared about keeping oil in the ground. Your gambit has failed- attempts to distract won’t succeed. You’ll lose.

1 gram of - decarboxylated * - 50% THC concentrate (dabs, "reclaim") - should be 500mg. 
Pour 50 ml of MCT oil in a 2 oz dropper bottle. 
Heat slightly with the dropper removed if necessary and shake to homogenize fully.  
 it should be around 10 mg per ml.
1158 2018-10-06 21:07:32 Not in Canada it not. 
That's I the USA. 
You know,  the same country that is paying fake enviros to landlock Canadian oil and gas.

1163 2018-10-06 21:05:33 No, we are.
We know it and you know it.
California isn't so heavily protested that their oil is landlocked.
Then there the matter of all those shiny new LNG plants that are built and more on the way in the U.S.
AND......the fact that the U.S. has surpassed all records in sales.

1216 2018-10-06 20:59:32 2/ market? B*thing about Notley does not address the fact that Alberta should have been diversifying years ago, & developed other markets years ago, & now we are playing catch up. There won't be the oil jobs there were in the past. Technology is changing that. 
Alberta still has
1217 2018-10-06 20:58:51 
1218 2018-10-06 20:58:43 I have good news for you. While fracking may cause minor earthquakes, it’s preventing larger ones.  Scientist may start fracking in places that don’t even have oil in order to prevent large earthquakes. As an environmentalist that should make you happy.
1219 2018-10-06 20:58:18 Tell us @arunjaitley how u vl solve oil? Tweets notwithstanding @RenukaJain6 @ssuyogk @suchetadalal @sidmtweets @ashoswai @YashwantSinha
1220 2018-10-06 20:57:21 Alberta has the strongest economy in Canada. Anyone who thinks oil is going to come back like it did before is only lying to themselves. The PCs rode the oil train, thinking it would never end. Why would oil companies invest when there is no market other than the discounted US
1221 2018-10-06 20:57:07 Someone actually said you can save "a lot" from N19,800.A LOT ??? These are the type of people that weighs their soap and uses spoon to measure oil. They're not living life. Life is living them

1227 2018-10-06 20:56:18 Actually the Iran deal almost immediately lowered oil prices (over the crying of the oil corporations) and ending the Iran deal almost immediately raised oil prices so you're wrong about that the rest sounds like a broken record most of it was Ws fault (really Cheney) w just dope
1228 2018-10-06 20:56:09 They should go and remove the 10% of all profit left for the new Oil company first. What will they do with it?

1232 2018-10-06 20:55:50 I've gotten a lot of benefit from it, but I did learn there are many companies selling what they call CBD oil and its made from seeds which are not effective. You need to check carefully.
1233 2018-10-06 20:55:25 Vegetable oil is relatively heart healthy. Even though it's probably more important to you that it's not hip.
1234 2018-10-06 20:55:18 What are the Saudi’s going to do when their oil runs out? Or worse, we go fully electric in the West and stop using oil? Dangerous regime trying to push banking and tourism. No chance.
1235 2018-10-06 20:55:07 We can see how functionally useless creationism has been, historically & currently, predicting or anticipating NOTHING (oil companies don't use Flood Geology, paleontology doesn't use baraminology, etc).

1238 2018-10-06 20:54:22 What are you doing with prices that are scuba diving and sky rocketing right under your watch. Cooking oil in some places has shot to ten mari. Fuel is scarse. Liquidity crunch. Shortages all point to lack of leadership. All quiet and watching e country degenerate into anarchy.

1249 2018-10-06 20:52:45 Price of barrel of crude oil & exchange rates:

Now under Buhari:
$85.03 * N361 = N30,695

Under GEJ:
$85.03 * N150 = N12,754

$110 * N150 = N16,500

So, the Buhari admin is earning almost DOUBLE the amount GEJ earned.

Keep this in mind when they say they made no money.
1250 2018-10-06 20:52:39 I never ate it as a kid, but my best friend roasts it in the oven with a little olive oil and sometimes a dash of spices, and it's really good.

1276 2018-10-06 20:47:09 Girl this was a process.I had to chop a lot off first&then I looked for products that moisturized my curls.I use Carols daughter hair milk, ouidad play curl volumizing foam&ogx Moroccan oil to seal it all in, u gotta play around tho to find what works best for you specifically
1277 2018-10-06 20:46:53 There’s only higher risk putting oil on rails when there’s a demand to put that oil on a boat and send if off to China. If the #TMX was about fixing B.C. and the Pacific NW’s supply issues, it wouldn’t be sold to Canadians based on potential sales to Asia and this $15B discount.
1278 2018-10-06 20:46:36 Addicted to my oil diffuser. I blame @CelebrityUK for the introduction. My scent choice tonight is Jasmine. 
1279 2018-10-06 20:46:22 My dad came over and cooked, took my car to get my tire replaced and my engine oil changed. I just got out of bed 
1280 2018-10-06 20:46:18 i thought of you this entire conversation lmao. plus side, i know a lot more about oil now

1284 2018-10-06 20:45:18 The oil revenue that goes to Holyrood? 
1285 2018-10-06 20:45:15 A bot must identify your type of dispute.
A bot must not review the law.
A bot must know that oil is found in sedimentary rock formations.
1286 2018-10-06 20:44:35 Yes. Republicans present themselves as victims to justify bigots. They can only do that with the most stupid ignorant voter, while they own every branch of government, the Fed, and most donors from big banks, big war, and big oil. Unless they whine over 'culture' wars.
1287 2018-10-06 20:44:32 #Texas: John Cornyn has received $1.448 million from banks, $1.27 million from oil & gas for starters. NOT A SINGLE protester was paid, and he knows it.
What hypocrisy.

1290 2018-10-06 20:43:40 Charlatans and snake oil salesmen posing as religious leaders. The sooner they all get taxed, the better.
1291 2018-10-06 20:43:38 And the 50/50 mix works really well for shallow fried foods like fried chicken or chicken fried steak. Although the oil isn’t for leaky gut, it’s because @RealPatchette is worried about Patchy having clogged arteries.
1292 2018-10-06 20:43:32 This peppermint oil on my scalp has me feeling a way lmao 
1293 2018-10-06 20:43:11 Lo desacredita la IPAA (The Independent Petroleum Association of America is dedicated to ensuring a strong, viable domestic oil and natural gas industry) en 2011. Dicho informe presenta información del 2008 al 2010.

1294 2018-10-06 20:43:10 Sir how did upa manage when crude oil was above $120 /barell?
BTW the present crude oil prices are still below $85/barell
1295 2018-10-06 20:43:07 As per this logic Congress was subsidizing everything mentioned in the video for almost 6 decades and was also simultaneously able to keep the price of crude oil and dollar under check.

1300 2018-10-06 20:42:50 Nonsense.    Oil prices tanked and US sanctions crippled their economy.    Stop with your propaganda.
1301 2018-10-06 20:42:39 No, women in the workforce is more important. If Norwegian women would’ve had the same level of participation as the OECD average we would have lost values bigger than our oil wealth.
1302 2018-10-06 20:42:37 Shame you can’t go to buy oil daily. It would get you off Sky in the afternoon. Kay Burley show is dreadful. Mark should do it instead. Lot more professional.
1303 2018-10-06 20:42:37 LaShayne Davis pastor Duncan wasn’t at the church.  Deacon George prayed over the oil & myself. They said they are gonna pray that I come join the choir.

1306 2018-10-06 20:42:24 To paraphrase The Iceman Cometh, someday @realDonaldTrump will be standing on a street corner in hell making suckers of the damned, telling them there's nothing like snake oil for a bad burn

1314 2018-10-06 20:41:30 I mean...Banksy's work isn't about being technically well made.  It's not oil paintings.  It has value based on cultural relevance and cache.  Honestly, there's nothing new about that, in the art world.  History is full of forgotten artists who were talented but unpopular.
1315 2018-10-06 20:41:23 Actors are one of the most politically agnostic professions. They have no financial benefit from advocating for social justice or a candidate. The direct opposite of health insurance professionals, oil industry execs, pharmacists, government employees and on and on and on.
1316 2018-10-06 20:41:07 Replacing Ginsburg with Barrett is next. Can't wait for the fantasy smear by the left and Democrats on that one. Will be better than a movie and in the end, the left will cry again. The circus will be amazing.

1327 2018-10-06 20:39:33 CBD oil tastes like I chewed on a leaf for a solid minute 
I took it at 4:20 for The Giggles (as in, I won't forget to take it at the same time every day)
1328 2018-10-06 20:39:28 He went to make his fortune in the oil fields of Texas.
1329 2018-10-06 20:39:13 just bought a shitload of CBD oil and bath salts, please contact me in my bathtub exclusively until Kavanaugh shuffles off his mortal coil
1330 2018-10-06 20:39:12 I can tell you this much for absolute certain international oil corporations don't fund GOP political campaigns for $40 oil they do it for $140 oil
1331 2018-10-06 20:39:06 Do you use white rice? We had to switch to some non-GMO ancient grain rice… it tastes really good, Patchy likes it better. It’s not as starchy. We boil it with garlic-infused oil and sea salt. @RealPatchette has switched from olive oil to 50/50 avacado oil and grasped oil.
1332 2018-10-06 20:38:55 Then why do I change your oil 
1333 2018-10-06 20:38:54 My car is fixed, apparently it was leaking oil

1335 2018-10-06 20:38:45 I got excited about a cheap but awesome oil change... it's the little things LOL
1336 2018-10-06 20:38:36 Question...what oil specifically is it challenging to get regular supply in? Is it a particular ratio of CBD to THC? Is it a particular potency?
1337 2018-10-06 20:38:14 When you go & get an oil change and there are 10 other things wrong w her, yeah we both know but we both hanging in there son. Gawwwwd, quit flawing savage like that she purrrrrrrfect the way she is after a full tank.

1339 2018-10-06 20:37:37 Deviled eggs can be almost no carb. Every year I'm asked to make roasted asparagus with olive oil and salt and pepper and I have to make tons because it's such a big hit.
1340 2018-10-06 20:37:16 Get Cody on pet CBD oil
1341 2018-10-06 20:36:50 Yup, I was working and had oil stains on my arms and hands, my mans was like "grab some dirt off the ground and just scrub" I tried it and it came right off
1342 2018-10-06 20:36:48 Tuna, pasta, onion, sweetcorn, kidney beans, with a little olive oil to bind. Superb.

1344 2018-10-06 20:36:24 And if we do cut emissions they say “See, those idiots don’t want to sell their oil. Let’s expand our markets while they commit economic suicide!”
1345 2018-10-06 20:35:32 Furthermore, as a mother of two you should watch your language publicly and when you are hawking Doterra to provide Peace and Serenity, you may want to have some self control!  Better bathe in that oil tonight!
1346 2018-10-06 20:35:07  cause I feel like you did some what you do ? You look like the type to not put oil in ya car
1347 2018-10-06 20:34:51 The needs of the Dakotas & midwest are different than the needs of either coast + big city, so politicians that live in big cities shouldnt have a bigger say over stuff such as farm, oil, coal, and wind power regs because they don't deal with those kinds of things in their states
1348 2018-10-06 20:34:31 But for real, I have some flour and some oil, sugar, vanilla extract...I'm bout to make me a cake of sorts and make it till payday. Straight bible life. I'm bout it bout it. Got a lil jelly too

= it doesn’t. 

In fact it increases and as you say “accelerates” it.

1353 2018-10-06 20:33:55 Calm down bros. Shehu Sani didn’t participate in this election. Let’s wait by Monday we will know the real candidate of the party
1354 2018-10-06 20:33:51 I didn’t vote for him or support him. He’s a piece of crap snake oil salesman. I do however, think you’re painting with an extremely broad brush on everyone who doesn’t agree with your politics being absolute evil.
1355 2018-10-06 20:33:41 Now is precisely the time to buy if Bergen are selling. Waiting til they've gone will result in you buying in at a higher price. IMO of course.
1356 2018-10-06 20:33:21 is all that body oil called for in porn like damn y’all fcking or cooking shit
1357 2018-10-06 20:33:17 Exactly! And now states are considering making cbd oil illegal without a prescription. It’s insane

1359 2018-10-06 20:33:09 haha (I should add, there were more ingredients than that) dates, eggs, coconut flour, etc. There was just coconut milk, oil, and flour in there. And I ate a bunch yesterday and today.. so clearly not dry enough for me to consume 
1360 2018-10-06 20:33:02 So Thursday I went to see my lawyer about some personal business. Setting up a trust. Taxes. A mysterious oil and gas interest that fell into my lap out of the blue.

As I’m leaving, I joke that I shouldn’t ask what he thinks of Kavanaugh. But no, really, I shouldn’t have asked.

Look at hw Tinubu used direct primary to achieve his interest.
1363 2018-10-06 20:32:15 Well that's that. NOW we need to focus on the midterms. FOCUS. Think of it as a football game. We lost this one. But the season has just started. I think people feel KavaNot is going to install boiling oil cauldrons in the SCOTUS.
1364 2018-10-06 20:32:12 When you're eating it with groundnut oil. Why won't it be sad.
1365 2018-10-06 20:31:56 I tried sushi several times and every time I was like "meh". I prefer real fish over sushi by a longshot. Salmon seared in a pan with a little bit of olive oil and some herbs on a good bread wins every time for me
1366 2018-10-06 20:31:53 Hahaha  my cat fell in a bucket of engine oil once and we had to bath her 3 times to get it all off, she is already a grumpy girl so she was not impressed at all!! Cats are the best 
1367 2018-10-06 20:31:52 All Religion is a Form of Madness! Makes me mad! Sandy Hook was a test; everyone was a paid actor! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
1368 2018-10-06 20:31:48 Sir we import energy and global oil prices determine prices of such commodities in Pakistan. Also world oil prices are at decades' high atm as compared to 2013 when they were at lowest.
1369 2018-10-06 20:31:46 Please ignore the tiny holes in all my clothing, I just don’t know how to cook chicken without making it rain hot oil in my kitchen
1370 2018-10-06 20:31:44 I would vote for him mainly because I would vote for an oil drum before trump. I would then pray for him to win and keep on fighting if he didn’t.
1371 2018-10-06 20:31:37 Can we send @rkhuria to ME in exchange of oil bonds???

Is he even worth the loan left behind by UPA?

Today it is me who's paying for the price cut mounmohan gave.

At least, my country will not have to pay the interest for taking oil loan.

1393 2018-10-06 20:29:04 In LT ₹depreciation will be in line with inflation differentials.
In ST, IMO demand for $ is going up due to trade war, higher oil price. supply of $ is going down due to fed’s bond selling, ₹ will depreciate in line with EM currency which will push up inflation with a lag.

1405 2018-10-06 20:27:04 Nice piece, however the figures used by Mr Critch on how much Danny Wms bet on oil are way off. They used $150.00-$200.00 not $105.00
1406 2018-10-06 20:26:45 I know. Just saying
1407 2018-10-06 20:26:44 Loss of influence, loss of foreign exchange, loss of natural resources, water, oil loss of control over northern sea routes etc ?

1412 2018-10-06 20:26:27 They import bottled water home from 'the abroad'. Local pampers are not good for their children. Groundnut oil is not good for them, they want processed canola oil. They don't eat natural food, it has to be processed… indomie, pasta, KFC, McDonalds. They're not hipe until…
1413 2018-10-06 20:26:21 Beside the nomination, how His administration will react about oil prices raise OPEC?
1414 2018-10-06 20:26:20 Let #roevwade die! It has destroyed the average us citizens protection and increased suffering in the USA. states have the right to make their own laws! Let people understand if they dont vote then they should just #shutup and take whatever happens with a spoonful of castor oil.
1415 2018-10-06 20:26:04 Currently, castor oil and flaxseed.
Lastly, argan oil.

What is your favourite?
1416 2018-10-06 20:25:53 Right, cause the NDP alone crashed the global price of oil and are accountable for all infrastructure the previous government didn't build, like Transmountain 
1417 2018-10-06 20:25:49 Thank you for looking at this. What is happening to form an alliance w/RU makes some sense in the context of global shipping & distribution. Old lanes are clogging. New ones may open. For billionaires bent on maintaining global oil dependency, hacking nav systems must be a no-no.
1418 2018-10-06 20:25:31 Bought an essential oil diffuser. Am I boring yet?
1419 2018-10-06 20:25:24 Lol he's not trying to yab us, but irin that's d most used term in the school, then in Hausa akwai kuura is also another term or an bajeni
1420 2018-10-06 20:25:06 Should try my cbd oil mate it will help 
1421 2018-10-06 20:24:53 But the @Scotus will now overturn the children’s climate change case. The oil cartel will now subvert all power to themselves and their banks. We must find a way to escape their Nazi future. We need a green trek to micro grids and circular economies for communities. No more state
1422 2018-10-06 20:24:53 It’s oil from cannabis, but not THC. It’s supposed to help with anxiety depression pain among other things. So far the few things I’ve tried have dulled my paid pretty well as I’ve weened myself off ibuprofen.

1425 2018-10-06 20:24:37 You clown. Israel does not get economic aid from US and has no oil reserves as compared to Arab states. Israel has a strategic alliance with the US and gets grants for purchase of military equipment from US. Not free by any means. Benefits US economy.
1426 2018-10-06 20:24:21 I knew it the whole time them folks want oil. Hiring those women to accuss that black man.

1428 2018-10-06 20:24:05 Coconut oil, I wish I knew. Lanolin is just gross and with my first baby I chose to nurse on my right side for two weeks while my left nipple healed because it had started to bleed and peel off. Seriously freaked me out!
1429 2018-10-06 20:23:58 I’m sick and furious. And I’ve got those oil slicks Cornyn and Cruz to thank for this debacle. Early voting cannot start soon enough. #VoteBlue
1430 2018-10-06 20:23:57 And they can do it because Norway kept more of the oil revenue for the benefit of their citizens unlike Alberta who gave much if it to the oil companies and frittered away the Heritage fund.
1431 2018-10-06 20:23:50 I read microbiology, 6 years+ work experience in oil & energy. I can program in Javascript (Rookie), interested in taking up python too. I'd like to keep in touch with you too. I'd be glad to learn from you.

1436 2018-10-06 20:23:09 The dream of the oil men who put Reagan into the Presidency has come to pass. And now it’s over. Time for a new dream based on care for the air, water, land, and all people.
1437 2018-10-06 20:22:55 Don’t think Floyd would give a flying fuck about Millar at all these days. His cannibis oil business in Leadville is booming. Good on him.
1438 2018-10-06 20:22:40 Rule number one, Cut off all communication with the person.
Thank me later.
1439 2018-10-06 20:22:30 Imma steal your oil you fucked up
1440 2018-10-06 20:22:26 I’ll never understand the guy who’s life sucks so much that he has to chirp someone if their team is shit. I know i don’t chirp anyone about their team, yet still get guys who wanna seek me out if the Oil play bad. There’s gotta be something else up if that’s what gets them off
1441 2018-10-06 20:22:24 How much V05 hot oil you use fam?

1445 2018-10-06 20:21:28 I'm grateful for the wine festival we already had planned for today. Info on where you obtained 8 ounces of CBD oil, please? Sisters of the Valley doesn't sell that big of a bottle.
1446 2018-10-06 20:21:12 Y’all one time I had an oil painting drying on my bedroom floor. I saw my cat with red paws later that day and I was so confused. It took me a few days to see that my cat had stepped on it after seeing a faint kitty print on the painting lol.
1447 2018-10-06 20:21:07 No, no es de Yale.

1453 2018-10-06 20:20:32 L'objectif de notre gouvernement et de nombreux États européens et de nous mettre le prix du Gaz Oil aux prix de l'essence, il fallait simplement abaisser le prix de l'essence !! Tellement plus simple . Beaucoup moins lucratif pour eux !!
1454 2018-10-06 20:20:13 It could be oil
1455 2018-10-06 20:20:06 @KendallRaeOnYT do you know if peppermint essential oil is any good for aromatherapy? Because I just sprayed it all over my house to keep stink bugs out & damn am I getting aromatherapy from it

1460 2018-10-06 20:19:30 Being United isn't best enuf to explain the situation In Iran and here. Iran has oil only and wat have we here... We have almost every mineral in Zim and most of the land here is suitable for agriculture but wat are we doing. Ours is a case of mismanagement of resources
1461 2018-10-06 20:18:57 水(ウォーター)とは仲が悪いです。
1462 2018-10-06 20:18:57 What natural gas from EE? It was designed as a bitumen export pipe. 
Oil Sands bitumen for export does not equal a decrease in imported oil.
And an upgraded refinery? What is your timeline on that??
1463 2018-10-06 20:18:57 This so aggravating gettin a oil change and transmission flush I’m ready to go

1480 2018-10-06 20:16:47 I love all the people against the oilfield like bitch you driving a gas/or diesel vehicle, that takes oil to run properly!!! And if I’m not mistaking all three of those come from the oilfield! So unless you gunna be walking stfu
1481 2018-10-06 20:16:37 Kenya's probably doing far more for conservation than the US is, since your ignorant husband was elected.

Reducing the size of protected areas to facilitate oil drilling, permitting oil exploration in the Arctic, restarting mining without putting pollution controls in place.
1482 2018-10-06 20:16:25 Yeah, I wouldn't characterize Missouri as being redder than Texas

Just sayin, oil money is local here
1483 2018-10-06 20:16:13 Definitely not on those clubs level have more respect for Utd than those oil run clubs!! Ferguson left at the right time squad was piss poor how the fuck some of those players he had still there
1484 2018-10-06 20:16:13 He campaigned on not doing nation building but he wasn't any less pro-war. His shtick was that he was going to hit them even harder but not stay (and take the oil on the way out).
1485 2018-10-06 20:16:09 After we sell all our oil, gas, and uranium, what's next?
1486 2018-10-06 20:16:06 Started in Texas with the original good ole boys network.  Big Oil.
1487 2018-10-06 20:15:51 Pricing health insurance...  My essential oil game bout to be so strong 
1488 2018-10-06 20:15:46 Stir together 1/3 cup curry with 1 pound babaganoosh. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Cut with butter. Serve the next morning for breakfast.
1489 2018-10-06 20:15:41 This older gentlemen came in the dispensary behind me and it was his first time, and he asked if it was open for the public :’) it was adorable. He just wanted to get some CBD oil for his joint pain

1491 2018-10-06 20:15:13 My Oil Burst Doing The Delivery Trip.... FUCK! But They Had A Seal On It... Idk How It Got Open

1493 2018-10-06 20:14:53 I don't live in muranga but I support mwangi wa Iria 100%. Turkana negotiated on their oil, kwale on their titanium, narok on their Mara and tourism, kitui and their coal, so what's wrong with muranga demanding what is theirs?
1494 2018-10-06 20:14:29 今回のはどうやったのか自分でもよくわかってないねっ！
まぁその時その時の好みでまた調整するんじゃないかと思う

1496 2018-10-06 20:14:20 If you do try it, go to Iceland, efag £6 oil £1 a bottle. Replace the top bit every 2-3 weeks £2. Bit different from £9 - £12 a packet. A bottle of oil lasts me roughly a week.
1497 2018-10-06 20:14:14 Pull up a graph  but remember the old numbers are adjusted for inflation the price of oil/fuel climed steady after the invasion of Iraq all the way to $4.25 and $147.50 the price fell with the crash of course but was right back up as soon as O got economy on life support
1498 2018-10-06 20:14:14 good crusty bread good olive oil and sea salt really is all one needs to have it good in this life huh
1499 2018-10-06 20:13:45 I don't know, it was really touching when they channeled the '60s and started singing, "WE SHALL OVERWEIGHT."
1500 2018-10-06 20:13:42 My Opinion ....  Track & Lucas Oil should of made it 30K for 30th Pittsburgher   100. 
1501 2018-10-06 20:13:35 I'm pained at the way products of crude oil are been circulated in Port Harcourt and it's environs while we have  security agents.
1502 2018-10-06 20:13:31 It's sad how quickly plantain can go from brown to black in hot oil. 
1503 2018-10-06 20:13:22 You sure can't say it was only driven to church on Sunday. Rode hard, put up wet. Gears stripped. Burns more oil than gas. Tires bald. Upholstery ruined.
1504 2018-10-06 20:12:31 Add oil
1505 2018-10-06 20:12:17 Oil changes for the low starting next year
1506 2018-10-06 20:11:33 Or in my case .. I'm facing 18yrs jail in Sth Aust for supplying free cannabis oil to ppl that were sick and dying. Prosecutors going hard on me.. bt are letting the pedos off.. and refusing to investigate. My friend has made 80 complaints to diff depts.. all ignored.
1507 2018-10-06 20:11:24 それが特に何をどう変えてるのか自分でもよくわかってないので多分何がおきてたのか自覚できたことと、自分の中での基準が生まれたという意識変化でスイッチが入って今までの積み重ねが活用できるようになり始めたのではないかと自己分析してる
1508 2018-10-06 20:11:21 Hey ed, take ur oil now
1509 2018-10-06 20:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza this Spring Sampler will be: sad crust with stale coconut oil and egg.
1510 2018-10-06 20:11:04 Parents idea of a snack food: non-salted nuts and dried fruit, a fig Newton, or a bag of sesame oil flavored corn chips.
1511 2018-10-06 20:10:35 What is it like being bald and always having the light glare off of your 100% shine oil cranium?
1512 2018-10-06 20:10:22 Thank you lads for your shareholder public service. I think the next test result will be from #UKOG but I have a nearly equal interest in #Brockham oil flowrate.

1515 2018-10-06 20:10:12 #Abhyanga Tip: Save yourself the hassle and expense of having to call a plumber by taking simple preventive measure: after completing your shower, while the shower water is still hot, pour a little dish soap down the drain to help break up the oil.
1516 2018-10-06 20:10:08 Lmao Olive Oil not getting re-elected.#AmbersayWhat!?
1517 2018-10-06 20:10:06 Considering major cabinaet members are just casually performing light sedition on the regular wrt adminisation orders I’m not TOO worried, until like, we decide Canada is holding on to much oil
1518 2018-10-06 20:10:03 サラダ油に流されて変わってゆく私をあなたは時々遠くで叱って。
1519 2018-10-06 20:10:03 I pay $20 for the oil change for my car and the oil change for my mom's SUV wayyyy more than that smh
1520 2018-10-06 20:10:00 I got off the phone with @tilray regarding Liam’s oil. The call agent couldn’t tell me if there is a supply and I won’t know until Monday. Took my CC *just in case* to place an order Monday. After five years of dealing with this shit from LP to LP I have just about had it.
1521 2018-10-06 20:09:59 Muji lemongrass essential oil goes dumb hard
1522 2018-10-06 20:09:46 also i sat in on kimberly’s first oil class today and she’s so incredible like wow i have a best friend who has taught me so much about essential oils, i respect her knowledge on them so much, i hope one day i can introduce and show people the power of oils like she does 
1523 2018-10-06 20:09:40 朝からミリエロ絵師ブロックする作業が始まる
1524 2018-10-06 20:09:23 I forgot all about an oil change

1526 2018-10-06 20:09:10 日付変わる頃に起きるんだけど結局やることなくてまた寝ちゃう
1527 2018-10-06 20:08:57 He’s 4,000 miles overdue for an oil change....
1528 2018-10-06 20:08:53 And oil for Lambo and we are good to go!
1529 2018-10-06 20:08:27 Absolutely zero impact. Oil is fungible commodity that gets sold anywhere.
1530 2018-10-06 20:08:08 The founders definitely could not change anybody’s oil.
1531 2018-10-06 20:07:59 @a_tweeter_user and @_gackerman_ are two unsung Managed Defense heroes that put these pieces together. Their team is never disengaged with threat actors. This gives them unique global visibility and experience. I know @a_tweeter_user burned the oil proving this connection.
1532 2018-10-06 20:07:46 I agree. I'm not an Oil fan. I just don't get why you hating when you don't cheer for the franchise
1533 2018-10-06 20:07:37 @DukeCambridgeUK also flavor the meat with garlic, olive oil (replacing the fat with) and red wine. Don't forget the salt and pepper too bro. Lol, thx. Enjoy.
1534 2018-10-06 20:07:23 Menthol oil is different, you get a kick off of it. I've triedTabocco, Fruit but prefer it as it gives me the felling I have a real cigarette, also I pay a £1 a bottle.
1535 2018-10-06 20:07:20 Oily/combo. I dont really have acne, but large pores, oil production, redness in some areas, and it just looks blah
1536 2018-10-06 20:07:15 However, the natural gas from EE could provide cleaner source of Canadian produced power. And a twinned pipeline with diluted bitumen would cost less than the oil we import. An upgraded refinery in the east is a win-win for all of Canada.
1537 2018-10-06 20:07:02 my @EdmontonOilers disappointed in the effort but it’s just the first game. Go get em Oil. Good practices and lets come out hungry in Beantowm
1538 2018-10-06 20:06:56 It's getting finer by the week hence the oil treatment(s) yes lol  Lets see how it looks after a wash
1539 2018-10-06 20:06:55 Came to this car wash place to get the oil changed on my mom's motor vehicle and get it washed and the lobby looks like a place in the Midwest
1540 2018-10-06 20:06:49 the body shop has like an over-night mask with tea tree oil. super helpful
1541 2018-10-06 20:06:48 aceite de ricino es lo mismo que castor oil?????
1542 2018-10-06 20:06:29 Again this is supported by the oil and gas drilling!
1543 2018-10-06 20:06:26 i have quite dry skin so this might be different, but i used tea tree oil and it helps get rid of spots almost over night!!
1544 2018-10-06 20:06:05 It’s pretty bad, but I do miss that oil money. If I was still there I would have had $1600 direct deposited to my bank account just two days ago. 
1545 2018-10-06 20:06:04 If a government finds and oil, diamond or gold in your backward, it's government's property.
But they find drug in your backward, then it's yours.
Quiet funny
1546 2018-10-06 20:05:50 まじで5時？真っ暗じゃん
1547 2018-10-06 20:05:47 I’m waiting for a day when oil change guys would just do the oil change without declaring everything else on the car obsolete
1548 2018-10-06 20:05:25 Well, this new far right wing SCOTUS is about to begin the process of winding America back to the early 1900's when women were possessions to be impregnated, 10 year children worked in mines, and oil and railroad barons ruled the country and monopolized their business interests.
1549 2018-10-06 20:05:20 lol anyway i’m gonna dunk my head in a vat of hot oil now
1550 2018-10-06 20:05:18 台風で外があまりにも暗すぎて夜中の気分
1551 2018-10-06 20:05:07 Snake oil of the Democrats has been defeated. Hawkers and shills need not try.
1552 2018-10-06 20:05:01 Coconut oil is like my makeup I can’t go wth out it
1553 2018-10-06 20:04:56 Had to rush it today just make it for a oil change 
1554 2018-10-06 20:04:53 After investors interpreted move by India’s #Modi gov to cut gasoline & diesel prices by Rs 2.50 per litre as a reversal of a 2014 decision to scrap regulate. Finance minister Arun #Jaitley notes there is no going back on deregulation of oil prices
1555 2018-10-06 20:04:51 My oil change was done an hour ago but this #TXOU game was worth staying
1556 2018-10-06 20:04:51 I know Lucic played okay conpared to the rest of the oil but if they continue to feed him top 6 minutes and he doesn’t put out he’s going to drag this team to  the basement
1557 2018-10-06 20:04:48 My car feels so much better after that oil change !
1558 2018-10-06 20:04:46 India Will Buy Weapons From Russia And Oil From Iran, Ignoring us Warnings
1559 2018-10-06 20:04:37 I still want a vape thing for weed oil...
1560 2018-10-06 20:04:36 If you mean makeup though, it's not.  Not at all.  Makeups use talc, and oil based creams, and dyes, and is very prone to smudging, and even if you seal it, it will fade and migrate.
1561 2018-10-06 20:04:26 i still stand by my view that the economic situation should have been explained to the people of India as soon as they had come to power. Now you shell out charts and news that there were oil bonds etc with 8% interest, Iran payments were pending etc etc
1562 2018-10-06 20:04:20 Last year after the first  Oil Game of the year they where gonna win the  Cup. This year they lose it so I assume they will just win the cup.
1563 2018-10-06 20:04:03 The water is far too dirty to be cleaned from what I was informed when interning in oil and gas
1564 2018-10-06 20:03:56 PSA: Do not decide to try being healthy and take MCT oil for the first time then go out to the movies with friends or anywhere for that matter. Apparently, diarrhea is a side effect. Also kills your appetite for popcorn since your insides are in a high state of pissivity.
1565 2018-10-06 20:03:45 Giving her what she wants is nice but not going to make her not depressed. Material things have nothing to do with that. Haha. He made it seems like depression was a choice or resulted from her not having oil rubs.
1566 2018-10-06 20:03:44 Actually, it was oil industry inflicted. When the Americans needed our oil, all was well. Their dependency was a plus. Now, thanks to technologies developed by the oil industry, the US has enjoyed a shale revolution. /2

1569 2018-10-06 20:02:11 This is not important. The wish is to decimate the oil sands. There’s not enough votes in Alberta and it buys votes in the provinces that matter. Nothing to do with economics
1570 2018-10-06 20:02:07 and this doesn't take into account the volume of oil a Ferrari leaks sitting in a garage. 
1571 2018-10-06 20:02:07 the thing about lathering your hair in coconut oil so that it doesn't all fall out when you bleach it is that the fun only lasts for 30 mins or so before it starts smelling like literal vomit
1572 2018-10-06 20:02:06 I hope you are right. Oil will never win with this d and 8 of these forwards. Actually it’s embarrassing to be a fan of them.
1573 2018-10-06 20:02:04 This is because there was no plan B for the previous Alberta governments (PC), just as the UCP have no plan now. Your entire premise of economic stabilty is based on oil that isn't going anywhere. NDP has diversified, Calgary will catch up, as long as you aren't elected.

1578 2018-10-06 20:00:58 @jkenney thinks he can buck the basic economic principle of highest cost producer in a low price environment gets hurt the worst aka oil sands and AB.  He thinks he is above economic principles-well since he had no post secondary education, makes sense. #ableg #LakeOfFireParty
1579 2018-10-06 20:00:58 It infuriates me how many children with epilepsy have had to suffer because the legalisation of medicinal CBD oil takes sooo flipping long! What exactly constitutes "exceptional circumstances/situations"?! 50 seizures a day? 300?...If mine were as frequent I know what I'd want!
1580 2018-10-06 20:00:56 when U could announce DEMO urself on TV live why couldn't you make clear to ppl via a live address the legacy economic issues eg oil bonds etc and harsh steps needed. But the govt thinks its smarter than common ppl which its definitely not (its even arrogance to assume)
1581 2018-10-06 20:00:31 Regardless of who u want to point the finger @, justifying this panic buying z beyond me. How much cooking oil does one have to buy 2 be like u said “safe than sorry?”smh

1587 2018-10-06 19:59:52 Strange none of those can explain how they can afford to go alone when the cash from oil etc doesnt cover running costs now and its only going to decrease year on year and the SNP have admitted having their own admin eg a HMRC section would cost more than the current one does
1588 2018-10-06 19:59:34 If you use CBD oil: how are you ingesting it?
1589 2018-10-06 19:59:34 girl. That’s oil
1590 2018-10-06 19:59:33 Sir your government was also helpless at that time when crude oil prices were above .But you people didn't take any decision of reducing it.

This government took the advantage,so they have an upper edge on you.

1600 2018-10-06 19:57:42 We've done 24 month leases twice now. Paid way less per month that than buying and didn't have tires or brakes, just oil changes once or twice in that 24 months. I wouldn't do a lease longer than 24 or 36 months. That's new tires and brakes territory.

1616 2018-10-06 19:55:40 Yup. Auto industry contributes 18 billion I believe to our GDP? Oil and gas is around 120 billion.   But its the millions of potential voters that dictate national policy.
1617 2018-10-06 19:55:35 It's just boiled jalapenos emulsified with olive oil. I was blown away with how simple it is to make and how incredible it tastes. Oh also some salt.

1620 2018-10-06 19:55:03 Rachel, that’s not true. Your policies created massive unemployment, by raising corporate & carbon taxes. You took downward spiral of falling oil prices & poured gasoline on and lit the match

Then you kicked us more and forced electricity suppliers to move off of Coal too fast
1621 2018-10-06 19:55:02 I always find it funny when news outlets say things like “The S&P 500 had its worst week in a month” or “oil hits new high since August”. Like really?... who cares, simmer down
1622 2018-10-06 19:54:55 The 2 nutritional scientist that were the 1st to attempt to describe the healthy eating patterns of “some” Mediterranean people could never define what it was. It’s validity was compromised when we found out that governments and the olive oil cos. were paying cost of conferences.

1636 2018-10-06 19:53:02 The Light sweet crude oil that we import from the US in the East requires less energy to refine and sells for a better price. WCS discount for the bitumen we export to the US from the West is the need for transportation given the refinery locations, most of which are in the Gulf.

1639 2018-10-06 19:52:32 @VP if the sanctions are not fully implemented, the cancellation of the agreement is worthless, people are aware. It happened in 2016, something like that happened in 2018, and if Iran's oil is not completely cut off and released to China or India,

1648 2018-10-06 19:51:47 Gas produced in oil fields is usually flared in Iraq which is the second country in flaring globally. To use it for power generation rather than flaring is an improvement. Reducing flaring in Iraq is one of the environmental goals in Iraq.

1666 2018-10-06 19:49:59 Whilst hoarding and panic buying might look senseless on face value, a closer analysis shows our people have learnt from past experience.

1695 2018-10-06 19:46:14 Mr Jaytley if tweet cannot raise the concern of rising oil prices than do you want each indian to come to your office with petrol bill payment receipt?
1696 2018-10-06 19:46:10 Sunday-Afang 
Monday- Palm oil rice
Tuesday - Ogbono
Wednesday -Bitter leaf soup

All cooked by my husband.
1697 2018-10-06 19:45:48 Hi, I’m an OCD sufferer (usually with guilt/rumination manifestations). I tend to find that SSRIs do almost zero. What helped me the most was exposure therapy, and surprisingly, CBD oil! Maybe worth a looking into.
1698 2018-10-06 19:45:32 50 g of herbs to 200 ml of oil. Olive or sunflower. Put in a bowl, plastic. Cover. Stir 2x daily for 7 days. Strain with muslim into clean bottles. Store in a cool dark place for 1 month before usi ng.
1699 2018-10-06 19:45:26 I thought that chick had Taco Bell Fire Sauce packs in her shoes
1700 2018-10-06 19:45:25 Is she looking for new places to drill for oil or mine for coal?
1701 2018-10-06 19:45:25 Somewhere its honey, elsewhere olive oil,,,,, here its coke,,,,,    yeh ho kia raha hai  
1702 2018-10-06 19:45:24 Marble rye is my go-to. I grill it in a pan with olive oil.

You could also go with sourdough.
1703 2018-10-06 19:45:14 I need an oil change
1704 2018-10-06 19:45:04 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1705 2018-10-06 19:44:58 Exactly. White people always talking about their damn forefathers, but when it's actually time to put in work, it's clear they are only willing to go to war for oil, & are only comfortable killing & destroying Black & brown people. "Land of the free, home of the brave" my ass.
1706 2018-10-06 19:44:57  Fact is when you look at the assets Ukog have a massive upperhand however Angus Mcap is much smaller, therefore in my opinion, investment in both is advisable with maybe a 60/40 ratio
1707 2018-10-06 19:44:52 Yeah but coconut oil. Sometimes I just do honey & sugar.

1710 2018-10-06 19:44:28 @afbranco Schumer is selling snake oil. He listed the exact reasons to vote Republican. For Schumer, lies ARE his only truth. Truth is what he says it is. Shameless.
1711 2018-10-06 19:44:25 YES their sign literally said “made with lavender essential oil” it was questionably inedible
1712 2018-10-06 19:44:25 Thai oil. It's the bomb. Ask for Yuki, she's the bomb.but they're all really good
1713 2018-10-06 19:44:13 Also the body shop vitamin E range is very good and a decent price! These are a few off the top of my head. I use rosehip oil
1714 2018-10-06 19:44:00 Ppl need to educate themselves before using anything. Not all oils can be used directly on the skin & most need to be added to a carrier oil like coconut/almond/castor oil before applying on a test patch of skin to make sure you don't have a serious reaction
1715 2018-10-06 19:43:55 About to get a oil change been running on air all week 
1716 2018-10-06 19:43:53 Ripple’s relationship to XRP is akin Chevron’s relationship to oil. We have a lot of it, we believe it’s a superior technology and we support its many uses — for billions of reasons. But we don’t have all of it, we don’t control it and we aren’t it.
1717 2018-10-06 19:43:51 China is becoming the worlds largest producer of solar panels, Samsung in Korea almost has the wind turbine biz nailed down, all because we are too stupid to see the fossil fuel free future. The job of Canadians is to kill the oil patch. It is the job of Asians to fix Asia.
1718 2018-10-06 19:43:48 “If you’re going to cook something in a pan, heat up the pan dry, then add the oil and put the food in right away” to avoid burning the food says @calpeternell #BerkeleyIdeas

1720 2018-10-06 19:43:28 Interesting that they’re not protesting the increased tanker traffic due to the new LNG port at kitimat. Only Alberta oil.
1721 2018-10-06 19:43:24 Getting my oil changed & I just wanna be in my bed.
1722 2018-10-06 19:43:17 I think that's cooking oil not wee...
1723 2018-10-06 19:43:12 When oil was $100 in 2013, they were ubdwr sanctions selling it between $10-25 in the black market. Logically they'd be forced to expand production now.

Oil collapsed to $35 in 2014. They were still under sanctions. Nuke deal was in July 2015.

1726 2018-10-06 19:42:55 Strong idling oil pressure though. All is well.
1727 2018-10-06 19:42:36 What is he going to run for? Panther catcher? Elephant slaughterer? Hair oil spokesperson?
1728 2018-10-06 19:42:32 I'm so EMBARRASSED that this SNAKE OIL SALESMAN & CARNINAL SIDESHOW BARKER is from my state of N.Y. I can't BELIEVE that the people of N.Y.C. & EXTREME SOUTHERN N.Y. keep voting for this CAREER POLITICIAN & SELF-PROMOTER. Upstate dispies this STEAMING P.O.S.! He LIES like a rug
1729 2018-10-06 19:42:19 probably good tbh coconut oil seems to be good for everything
1730 2018-10-06 19:42:11 I’m way too relaxed for someone who has a lot of hair due, o just washed my face, used my toner and witch hazel, out tea tree oil on these two pimples, but my lip balm on and now I’m watching insecure 
1731 2018-10-06 19:42:10 I think it is. CBD takes the edge off for me but doesn’t give me deep relaxation. The oil is too pricey for me right now but helped so much.
1732 2018-10-06 19:41:57 いや～りんかちゃんはえっちですからね。これは反論しにくいんじゃないでしょうか。
冗談は置いといて、知らぬ存ぜぬ突き通されて終わりそう
1733 2018-10-06 19:41:57 I jumped out after dabbling for a second time about a month ago....
I felt a sense of relief when I sold!

There’s something not quite right with the Weald oil...

Still in Angus for now but looking for an exit
1734 2018-10-06 19:41:55 This is exactly me watching the Oil today. 
1735 2018-10-06 19:41:52 $120 for an oil change I think not! 
1736 2018-10-06 19:41:51 So you’re gonna buy oregano oil. It’s @ any health food store. Make sure you get one w/ a dropper. You’re gonna add 2-4 drops to a full glass of water and mix it. The cup has to be glass, & u have to drink through a straw, or it’ll burn ur lips. It’s gonna be nasty, but it works

1744 2018-10-06 19:39:58 As an Oil fan, i often have trouble picking who is more inept, McLellan or Chiarelli. Just when i go to pick one, the other does something ridiculous.
1745 2018-10-06 19:39:57 We must flip the house and the Senate in November.  This shit is ridiculous! Our government is controlled by big business, big oil, Russian oligarchs and corrupt idiots!
1746 2018-10-06 19:39:55 Here we are sinking into drained oil reservoirs so we will be right behind you if the coast doesn't catch up to us first.
1747 2018-10-06 19:39:48 Why you can't bring oil under Gst when you are facing some problem?
1748 2018-10-06 19:39:43 While waiting for an oil change today I met some people who are struggling. I’d like to think I brought them a bit of hope. 

Spread love, peace, and connectedness wherever you go. Connection with other people can change a life.

1753 2018-10-06 19:38:53 The Mazda needs an oil change and probably many other things, but all I can afford is an oil change.
1754 2018-10-06 19:38:50 That baby oil sex though...
1755 2018-10-06 19:38:33 just made this lipscrub with almond oil, honey, & sugar.
1756 2018-10-06 19:38:28 All. Of. It. I promise if I could bathe in lavender oil I would lmao
1757 2018-10-06 19:38:25 Hm, why not using few drops of pure Jojoba oil on wet skin and let it dry then follow it up with some pure Sheabutter afterwards? It did work wonders for my skin and it's natural, IF you get the pure ones (with no additional things in it)
1758 2018-10-06 19:38:24 @SenSchumer

I did Vote. Voted for Trump. He Won.
I just hope that in the next Vote they Vote you out of office. You went from being a Politician of the people to nothing more then a sleezy snake oil salesman.

1759 2018-10-06 19:37:42 There are 0 news of Iranians shutting down oil production. 

Which means their oil is going....somewhere, officially or in the back market at steep discounts, just like the period before sanctions lifted in 2015.

1767 2018-10-06 19:36:29 Try talking to an essential oils expert. I am #fibro but haven’t had that symptom. Also, I may be starting CBD oil, both internal and a cream. I can’t take the poison docs prescribe. Hang in there!
1768 2018-10-06 19:36:22 I'll have to skim the episode. Having taken fish oil for four or five years, I'm a fan plus I love broccoli and Brussels sprouts (fried with bacon). I can't say it's magic, but I go back to it and always feel better when I take it.

1784 2018-10-06 19:33:42 Opec were demanding money from governments. They responded by not buying oil causing a demand on the coal fired power stations because electricity must come from somewhere.

1803 2018-10-06 19:31:38 @realDonaldTrump plz plz Sir don't let oil companies raise gas prices on Americans. Some off us just started working. Gives time to save. I've been working but just started have lil extra cash. If gas prices go up then middle America screwed again.
1804 2018-10-06 19:31:25 @VP I'm talking to Republicans, you know, I never make mistakes. If Republicans want to win, they should finish Iran's oil production by November 4th, China and India must cut off their oil from Iran.
1805 2018-10-06 19:31:19 Sorry wasn't it about that time the first Antitrust Laws were passed?  Sherman Act 1890?  US v Standard Oil 1911?

1807 2018-10-06 19:31:14 Enbridge Line 3 carrying light sweet oil from SK is about as good as it gets. Just need to keep it north of the border and get it to Thunder Bay, unlikely with the LibCons, too much temptation to be walked on like a doormat by the states.

1810 2018-10-06 19:31:05 Lol. But it’s about time. Water is the next oil. It will trigger wars. Actually, it already is somewhat, if you consider that Cocacola has through its subsidiary Beverage Services Ltd acquired Kilimanjaro Water (Tz), Ruwenzori Water (Ug) and Keringet (Ke).
1811 2018-10-06 19:30:57 Kavanaugh threatened the entire Democratic Party.  If you want to continue with your rape apologetics and pretending Brett Kavanaugh is somehow a victim, you should try selling that snake oil to someone else because I’m not buying it
1812 2018-10-06 19:30:54 IG Farben ran the Jewish Labour camp of Auschwitz where Jewish slaves produced synthetic petrol & rubber for Hitler – on licence from Rockefeller´s Standard Oil!

1813 2018-10-06 19:30:41 Haha. Dr Manmohan Singh’s government NEVER PAID money on imported OIL from Iran when crude around $140 & same time his government kept Oil prices higher too. Where did money gone? Ahh forget so many Corruption. Modi government is paying MMS government imported oil.

1829 2018-10-06 19:29:01 I really think Leon is a great winger and not much of a centre... Oil keeps wanting him to be something he just isn’t. Hopefully something changes but not betting on it.
1830 2018-10-06 19:28:53 The US oil did before go for export, why? Because it is "dirty" oil, but it financed import of high quality oil to avoid polution.  Where does the oil go today?
1831 2018-10-06 19:28:27 They will keep the oil rigs away as well.

1833 2018-10-06 19:28:23 Transmountain is the better option anyhow. Pacific is the better route, new pipe, less pipe, eastern refining already supplies more than Cdn refined consumption, refining is still a nonoptimal option for oil. Enbridge Line 3 is a good step.
1834 2018-10-06 19:28:18 Oil price $84/barrel
1835 2018-10-06 19:28:03 I never feel more defensive than when I go to get my oil changed.
1836 2018-10-06 19:28:02 the stalker is a British robot. a robrit. if you smell oil in your tea, you'll know why.
1837 2018-10-06 19:27:49 gonna make pasta with cbd oil later
1838 2018-10-06 19:27:48 My dad sent me to get oil and a filter for my car. Ive done this before but I forgot what brand of oil he wanted. I brought the wrong oil and he said he’s very disappointed in me. Ok dad, go buy me a foundation and mascara for my bottom lashes.
1839 2018-10-06 19:27:46 I think there is more chance of a spotted cow jumping over the moon than getting flow test results from #Brockham EWT Before the new year imho
1840 2018-10-06 19:27:37 the great health and educational depression in Central Africa's Equatorial Guinea despite of being a high-income nation since 2003 because of it's oil and natural gases f u EG Pres and Gov. Die. 1M ppl doesnt deserve your ass.
1841 2018-10-06 19:27:32 Reminded of the Widow of Zarephath in church this morning: every night she went to bed thinking she had no more bread to give. Every morning there was more oil and flour. So many of us feeling knocked down this week, but we will rise to discover we still have enough to #KeepGoing
1842 2018-10-06 19:27:32 Jamaican black castor oil did he damn thing to my hair cause
1843 2018-10-06 19:27:25 dont know....what do you think Cunners ?...and answer nicely.
1844 2018-10-06 19:27:15 Well done Leona...I love this oil 
1845 2018-10-06 19:27:13 عطني المقطع او الصورة
1846 2018-10-06 19:27:10 Yeah, especially oil and other greenhouse gas emitting substances...screw the planet, let's party so long as we don't have to pay the bill...heck, who knows, maybe our kids will clean it up.
1847 2018-10-06 19:27:08 Let’s skin cut your hair ,I’ll oil it every 3 hours if you wish 
1848 2018-10-06 19:27:03 Please explain to me how #Notley is responsible for low oil prices?
1849 2018-10-06 19:26:09 I can't agree. I think it was Rubio who said it clearly: Venezuela is an enemy because it's allied with Russia. Venezuela could be rich country, it has large oil reserves and powerful partners. However, US sanctions do not allow that. It has nothing to do with political system.
1850 2018-10-06 19:26:05 There’s no oil revenue going to Holyrood. That’s a part of the problem FFS

1853 2018-10-06 19:25:56 so I bought this tanning oil and haha I hope I can stay under the sun for at least 10 mins

1855 2018-10-06 19:25:21 Couple of likes and retweets on twitter break out the johnsons baby oil baby we done it #Nonce
1856 2018-10-06 19:25:21 Market access to a "change in oil prices" is still better than a further discount to that "change in oil prices". Regulatory hurdles, legal red tape, and an Indian (proper term according to law) reserve is why there's no EE pipeline, plain and simple.
1857 2018-10-06 19:25:10 Sorry, I don't know enough abt those time periods. If it's true, obviously there were other factors at play. I've no vested interest 1 way or the other, (which it seems you do, working in oil) so I'll defer to 97% of world's scientists who agree that CO2 is causing climate chng
1858 2018-10-06 19:25:05 She actually looks like she's drinking vegetable oil. Not sure what's worse...
1859 2018-10-06 19:25:00 Pollard is the most vociferous right wing tory propagandist that escapes real scrutiny in the media. His campaign against Corbyn & the Labour Party is more smear than fact, lacking in balance & rectitude. He's become more snake oil salesman than commentator.
1860 2018-10-06 19:24:52 I'm heard some people use it, but have no personal experience. Here's what I use "Sewing Machine Oil ZOOM-SPOUT OILER 4FL" Very in expensive and clean. Can get it on amazon or at Michael's Or Joann's Fabrics

1863 2018-10-06 19:24:35 I got my first oil change on my new car I bought last December. Had to wait 90 minutes as there was a line ahead of me, but everything is humming smoothly.

1865 2018-10-06 19:24:13 why bother consuming products with palm oil in them when u can just go to the zoo and slash an orangutans neck
1866 2018-10-06 19:24:12 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
1867 2018-10-06 19:23:52 It is like the precious oil on the head, running down on the cheek, on the chin of Mandisa 
1868 2018-10-06 19:23:50 I need a hot oil treatment

1871 2018-10-06 19:23:34 Oh dear. The British Nationalists are extra angry about everything today. Aid for Indonesia, oil, the weather. Just everything! Did something go down today to trigger all this anger? Hmmmm?

1874 2018-10-06 19:22:21 after listening to @foundmyfitness on @joerogan  i am planning to order some @carlsonlabs fish oil, start eating broccoli and brussels sprouts, and doing quarterly 72 hour fasts (most likely FMD). 

i think just those 3 things can help so much according to all the citations.
1875 2018-10-06 19:22:19 you do that Adrian. I hope you do get a good price. Im happy with mine and sticking.

1884 2018-10-06 19:21:17 The tax take from Scotland is relatively small. Oil companies own the rights to North Sea and it's all down to extraction costs. Roughly only around 52% of population pay tax and a very small amount towards the higher end.
1885 2018-10-06 19:21:14 Please refrain from accessing any and all EMS since most of the life saving tools are derived from oil and gas.
1886 2018-10-06 19:20:58 "Tim's Vermeer", right? that was a good one. this guy, van Meegeren, operated in the 20's-40's, was a skilled painter, and faked the age-old hardened oil paint by using Bakelite as a medium for the pigment so it couldn't be detected by the art forensics of the age. amazing.
1887 2018-10-06 19:20:51 Wyoming has oil.
1888 2018-10-06 19:20:47 Meanwhile it's likely India faces an economic collapse if Brent oil pushes 100 and stays there
1889 2018-10-06 19:20:40 well I agree Adrian.
And Cunners....we were chatting nicely there. Zip your last line wasnt needed.
1890 2018-10-06 19:20:39 Angus look good and will be a success, but that’s not to say you don’t look at short term facts. If Brockham was starting immediately Vonk would have said so, he also would have been aware of placement claims, and said nothing. I expect fund raise
1891 2018-10-06 19:20:39 omg wig I forgot to confirm my appointment for the oil change going  broken car
1892 2018-10-06 19:20:27 It’s nasty. Why would you use oil???
1893 2018-10-06 19:20:25 lmao i tried thinking ab that but it never helps  just gonna have to chug a gallon of cbd oil before i get my flight on monday
1894 2018-10-06 19:20:25 Flockledarna förlorade när de propagerade för peak oil och alla ingenjörer sa att de hade fel. Ingenjörerna vann. Ingenjörerna vinner även nästa gång, och gången därpå, och därpå och därpå....

1898 2018-10-06 19:20:14 in a Toyota Camry gas and oil are honestly optional
1899 2018-10-06 19:19:58 I just looked in my vinegar oil book and you can make lovely oil with  lemon  balm. Want the recipe? Goes well with fish and can be used as a marinade for fowl.

1903 2018-10-06 19:19:32 Right, so we need a solution because, it affects us beyond just daily oil needs. Education abroad for example has increased significantly. Sending money from here is far dearer than before and has over leveraged many. The ripple effects are pretty significant right now sir.
1904 2018-10-06 19:19:31 Collect tax money from a populace that depends on others & watch what happens when natural resources like oil production are insufficient. See Venezuela!

1916 2018-10-06 19:17:38 Ha you guys are...brave.
1917 2018-10-06 19:17:33 What scares me is looking at the first 10 games of the season... the Oil can easily go 1-9.
1918 2018-10-06 19:17:18 My bike battery gone kapput being on stand for 2 months. The baby has some clean up and leakage fixed from oil change bolt.
1919 2018-10-06 19:17:16 @ryanmeili - I’m usually an NDP voter, but this is an important question for you to answer. We do need a pipeline to tidewater so that we can get a better price for our oil to help out our province. Oil is still important, at least a while. Need answer #skpoli @Sask_NDP
1920 2018-10-06 19:17:02 I don't understand how @sweetgreen can be this delicious. I chop up the same items and put olive oil/vinegar on it and it doesn't taste as good.  HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE???
1921 2018-10-06 19:17:02 Everytime I go get an oil change they laugh cuz that shit be DRY
1922 2018-10-06 19:16:57 i’ve taken three showers and the oil paints are still on my arm what the Huck
1923 2018-10-06 19:16:45 Why this valuation come like that?
1. No growth in volume 
2. Looking at DY will mislead you as REC has 10% DY
3. Margin expansion in gulf oil 

I agree that Castrol is still a leader and have better margin but one can look this also as only Castrol is leader so it re-rate again?
1924 2018-10-06 19:16:42 Tig the Honda shadow trike has been officially winterized for the year.  Tune up, oil change, and fuel stabilizer done.  He is now under his winter cover and on the charger.  by the time I’m cleared to drive and ride the riding season will be over in Indiana

1928 2018-10-06 19:16:16 You said inflation rose in the past three years. On oil impact, Bhatia has made a note on why reduction in inflation from 10%+ to less than 4% is not just because of oil. Also, forex from tourism helps in reducing malnourishment. Why? Because more money to fight it
1929 2018-10-06 19:16:11 The single best decision I made this year was buying beard oil. This stuff is life changing.

1930 2018-10-06 19:15:57 CBD oil, made from hemp plant, not seeds, is fantastic for this. Legal in all 50 states.
1931 2018-10-06 19:15:51 4/ Thought experiment: Supply India's oil requirement at the price prevailing before the Iran sanctions were announced, and military equipment of equal or better quality/effectiveness, at equal or lower price and see if India agrees to both sanctions!

1935 2018-10-06 19:15:10 Investment was impacted by the regimes policy itself. Prior to 2009, Eritrean companies were ordered to halt any construction venture. Investors (Eritreans) were kicked out and their capital was confiscated from 2004. Anadarco oil drills were made to stop 2000. National slavery 2
1936 2018-10-06 19:15:05 Yeah, I bet 90 yr old Oren Hatch is really burning the midnight oil.
1937 2018-10-06 19:15:03 Sure, no rush. You'll have more and better options, especially used, in a few years. I get ~4 mi/kWh at the outlet (counting charging losses). At 120 mi/day, you'd use about 600 kWh per month, so your power bill goes up maybe $60-70/month. But no gas or oil changes.

1941 2018-10-06 19:14:20 So between India, China, Turkey, Syria (I know) and RU...we can count 1MBPD of Iranian oil "officially" on the market in Nov (after sanctions)...with current discount likely a lot more on the grey/black market....N/OPEC up 1.5MBPD..there is no lack of supply...imho
1942 2018-10-06 19:14:10 Just a thought , if the adhesion is that good , could you use it on a oil base finish prior to applying a water base system ?
1943 2018-10-06 19:14:06 From the article: “Oil prices have recovered around the world, but remain incredibly low in Alberta because of pipeline constraints and other issues.”

1947 2018-10-06 19:13:52 Shhhh you're too loud. Stop arguing with facts we don't like it. We have oil money to waste. Shey he would get another one once they drill the oil at Akwa Ibom?

1964 2018-10-06 19:12:30 Some of our #PLLC students explored this oil well-geothermal energy in their Capstone project last year. Very promising. Go Hinton! #lougheedcollege
1965 2018-10-06 19:12:30 I had blue juice, oil, kappa punch, and the iotas drink I’m still not drunk

1968 2018-10-06 19:12:11 Go Trans Mountain, let’s get this thing built so our economy can prosper, thus giving our government more money to spend on social programs and greener technologies. Unless you just want to send all the oil money to Saudi Arabia like @Tzeporah does
1969 2018-10-06 19:12:09 The world can’t get our oil. Only US buys our oil for a reduced price and then sells it to the world for a large profit. And who is directly responsible for not getting a pipeline to tidewater? Steve and Jay Jay. But let’s put Jay Jay in charge. That’s some crazy logic
1970 2018-10-06 19:11:47 So, preliminary review of the ecostyler cannabis and sativa oil & the gel: the scent is not my favorite....twisted my hair so gotta wait and see how it turns out tomorrow
1971 2018-10-06 19:11:40 Nothing will happen. Elections will pass. No riots or anything. 
But I’m still stocking tho. 
Bought flour, two trays of eggs, milk, oil, plantains etc

Price of barrel of crude oil & exchange rates:

Now under Buhari:
$85.03 * N361 = N30,695

Under GEJ:
$85.03 * N150 = N12,754

$110 * N150 = N16,500

So, the Buhari admin is earning almost DOUBLE the amount GEJ earned.
1976 2018-10-06 19:11:20 Just need to send it but it’s going to Wigs for Kids! And the clippings from the rest of the cut are going to a program that soaks up oil in the ocean.  My stylist was great and really helped me navigate to the charities I wanted to help most!

1978 2018-10-06 19:11:14 My new Chiropractor rubbed this strong ass CBD oil over my whole body now I smell like a walking dispensary in this Five Guys.
1979 2018-10-06 19:11:14 I was joking. Although a Ministry of Oil official once said to me, without irony, that "the last barrel of oil produced on earth will be in Iraq".
1980 2018-10-06 19:11:12 I don’t know. I have a severe fish allergy and have read that fish oil may trigger it.

1985 2018-10-06 19:10:41 Russia is our natural friend all times and they help us many times. And Modiji s and Putins chemistry is very nice. Two leaders are very popular. Even America is in tension about this deal. Our PM  said they import oil from Iran & make S-400 deal too. This is strength of leader.
1986 2018-10-06 19:10:38 This is why women don’t like getting oil changes. Who the hell wants to sit here ALL day

1990 2018-10-06 19:10:17 changed my battery and oil, but apparently the battery may not have been the problem with the battery. and my brakes apparently might give out like yesterday. 

honestly get the fuck out my face.
1991 2018-10-06 19:10:15 Yep and then we impeach the ones that weren't up for reelection yet to make an all dem house. Then its #muellertime. Then madame president hrc. Then its all free everything so that we can smoke hash oil and focus on our découpage Etsy storefront
1992 2018-10-06 19:10:14 Also - drinking Neck oil and punk ipa in quick succession really makes you realise Beavertown > Brewdog. (Though I admit dead pony a closer comparison)

1996 2018-10-06 19:09:58 I lived through those times, cheerlead for Jimmy all you want. Iran had oil, they had hostages. A President with balls would have had both.  Typical Dem, it is always the previous guy's fault. You should have been part of Obama's administration.
1997 2018-10-06 19:09:53 i really hate doing adult things like getting my oil changed
1998 2018-10-06 19:09:52 Bought Bailey, bought lindeloff. Whose fault is it that they re not performing. We don’t have oil money. The club has to spend with care. This is not city or PSG with a sugar daddy.

2007 2018-10-06 19:09:10 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.
2008 2018-10-06 19:09:08 I don't think so. Oil has better value exported than domestically used with subsidies. It's just lack of coordination between institutions.
2009 2018-10-06 19:09:08 Buying something new, plus dealing with tires, brakes, maintenance,etc. Leases you just change the oil once a year and if it's a 24 month lease, never dealing with brakes or tires.

2016 2018-10-06 19:08:28 When manufacturing job losses were high in Ont., he tightened EI rules and suggested they all move to Alberta. Trudeau expanded EI when Albertans were struggling due to low oil prices.
2017 2018-10-06 19:08:23 Tried my wife's CBD oil the other night and got the first really good sleep I've had in ages.
2018 2018-10-06 19:08:17 I know what you are going through, it has happened to me. I even had a shattered tooth abscess once, the nerve didn't get exposed for a few months (!!!). You may have found out already, but direct applications of *clove oil* will help with the pain from the tooth. 
2019 2018-10-06 19:08:08 I feel so let down by the @DNC using women to try and stop Kavenaugh when we had huge evidence of the @GOP treason with Russian oil money laundering. Just horrible
2020 2018-10-06 19:07:54 A little bit more oil maybe?

2025 2018-10-06 19:07:27 Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Avoid anti-dandruff shampoo. Eat sardines for shiny hair. Is it NISIM or NHB? A hair loss shampoo. or similar? How on earth do I uncover the right address. So flexible. Gentle to hair.
2026 2018-10-06 19:07:22 Nothing but a photo-op! @FLOTUS She's probably checking things out for an oil or land deal! These people NEVER do things for others, it is ALWAYS about them & how they can benefit!

2030 2018-10-06 19:07:05 You don’t know what I don’t know!
A country with the biggest oil reserves in the world should not be crawling about on its hands and knees because of 
US sanctions surely...US one of those countries with the failing economic system right?
2031 2018-10-06 19:07:02 I’m also like waaay overdue for another oil change I’ve needed one for the last like 2 months but I’ve hardly driven as of late

2041 2018-10-06 19:06:05 Muffle fix isn't that expensive, assuming you can do it yourself same with oil changes. Childs play, and working breaks used to be the same but the industry is phasing out customers doing their own repairs. So that is artificially more expensive at least. And cheaper with Tesla.
2042 2018-10-06 19:05:59 I think the illustration has the right message....    and your point is very real.... We just need to share the roads better....  We're too used to the convenience of the oil age.  But that's changing..... fast.

2072 2018-10-06 19:03:33 Interest rates go up in a good economy. That's the Fed's role and they do it to control inflation. Trump has nothing to do with it. OPEC controls oil prices to a large degree. Passage of ANWR helps though.

2083 2018-10-06 19:02:14 I think the problem is the batter. It should have been a little bit thicker and make sure the oil is hot as well.

2097 2018-10-06 19:01:02 I appreciate your positive outlook but to start out being so fragile is tough to take as an Oil fan.  I get it’s the first game, I just thought the team wanted to prove something, maybe they did 
2098 2018-10-06 19:00:56 I thought coal, gas, oil, and nuclear energy was controlled by Westminster?
2099 2018-10-06 19:00:54 This probably added oil and then a lit match to that wave so now it is just a massive roaring flame filled wave 
2100 2018-10-06 19:00:50 Total "gas price" = wholesale price + retail profit margin + gas taxes. Based on maximum $ consumers will pay, total gas price goes up or down by major oil companies' daily manipulation. Every cent gas taxes are reduced = more profit margin for JOHN COX'S BIG OIL COMPANY DONORS.
2101 2018-10-06 19:00:48 Ok oil change filter change topped off fluids air pressure in tires good replaced a recalled piece and car coming out the wash now! My responsibilities is done for the day I believe
2102 2018-10-06 19:00:46 Blend 4 tsps jalapeño with 4 cups Squid . Add generous amounts of Olive Oil. Boil. Serve a la mode
2103 2018-10-06 19:00:45 The next time you're cooking sausages and the oil start coming at you. Tell it I'm cooking you, you're not cooking me! BLESS UP!
2104 2018-10-06 19:00:38 salt and straw has olive oil ice cream but only in their portland stores it was SO good and i think abt it every day
2105 2018-10-06 19:00:36 As tweets come in of 100k marching in our stolen capital,I cant wait for the unionist to march too, demanding more austerity, more benefits deaths, more nhs cuts, more Westminster parasitism, more 15 grand flag poles, more foodbanks, more oil theft, and more democratic deficit,PN
2106 2018-10-06 19:00:33 Went in to get an oil change, leaving spending $131 on more shit that’s wrong with my car  adulting literally sucks

2113 2018-10-06 18:59:55 Invest in green energy, limit coal and oil lobbying(and lobbying in general), publicize who is bri- I mean donating to politicians maybe make them wear their sponsors on their jacket like NASCAR

2115 2018-10-06 18:59:40 Mixing one part green tea, one part lemonade, and two parts seltzer water together with a touch of peppermint oil and putting it all on ice.

That's my thirst-quencher. Yeah.
2116 2018-10-06 18:59:34 I thought David Black was wanting to build an oil refinery, not gas.
2117 2018-10-06 18:59:28 What the oil that the last independence referendum was fought on? And the oil that crashed soon after that referendum if we had voted yes we would have been fucked.
2118 2018-10-06 18:59:24 Crazy, I heard they may be going after CBD oil again! Makes no sense.
2119 2018-10-06 18:59:24 Vegan chorizo with black olives, grilled onions, bean sprouts, jalapeños, and jalapeños, with ketchup and oil and vinegar served open-face on biscuit.
2120 2018-10-06 18:59:11 Cooking oil?
2121 2018-10-06 18:59:10 So since @_honeyandmilk asked me I'm about to drop my skin care routine. Every morning I wake up I wash my face with clean and clean oil free morning burst facial cleanser. I use an electric face washing brush to avoid touching my face with my hands while I do it.
2122 2018-10-06 18:59:08 Yeah I deep fry it in tons of oil.
2123 2018-10-06 18:59:04 هات لي دبل تيفو للنصر؟
2124 2018-10-06 18:59:01 Don’t forget the economy.  In two years likely to see higher interest rates, higher inflation, higher oil prices, higher unemployment, higher deficits, etc.
2125 2018-10-06 18:58:19 the real reason i want to go to portland to see hozier is the olive oil ice cream
2126 2018-10-06 18:58:19 Sir , Any numbers to compare the investment in infra between UPA 2 and NDA, that should bust the claim of excise collected during low oil period was invested in infra et al
2127 2018-10-06 18:58:17 You can make it in nonstick-ones too as long as you put much more oil to fry  almost 1 inch
2128 2018-10-06 18:58:16 @Mangan150 Hey I'm curious why you state that liquid fish oil are less susceptible to going rancid vs. capsules? I haven't seen that anywhere. I ask b/c Carlson added sunflower oil and "natural flavors" and I am searching for a new brand but other liquid options aren't as good.
2129 2018-10-06 18:58:08 This number would seem to iclude me right now, full of gin & tonic, some beers and three (?) ciders.

Better just count the actual people in service (those oil drinking whale killers have conscript reservists of their own as well).
2130 2018-10-06 18:58:05 You’re making me want to go get my oil changed 
2131 2018-10-06 18:58:05 I have always said this plus they earn more now from the non oil sector, there has always been alot of money.
2132 2018-10-06 18:57:47 It’s early, Oilers having some struggles, but good to see Oil Fan Twitter is in midseason form
2133 2018-10-06 18:57:40 Have to imagine if the oil go 0 - 4 on the trip one or both of tm and Chia are gone

My .... JUICE??! 
2142 2018-10-06 18:56:45 2/ India's problem is the massive costs imposed on Indian economy by oil price rise resulting from Iran sanctions, and CAATSA gun at our head to bust our limited def budget & leave us vulnerable to Chinese threats, by forcing us to drop purchase of cost effective defence equip!
2143 2018-10-06 18:56:38 I lost one of my rings. I'm sure it's in my house, but my anxiety does not care.

Thank goodness for CBD oil.

2149 2018-10-06 18:55:34 Wonder what future generations will make of SNP claim to be leaders in Climate change ? Its as if SNP are saying the Oil extracted from the North Sea that’s boosted our life style has not had a major impact on Global temperatures. Oil that an inde Scots economy was to be based.
2150 2018-10-06 18:55:31 I was under the impression that the olive oil used for canned salmon, tuna and sardines is usually low quality, oxidized junk. Better to buy packed in water and add your own oil from a trusted source?
2151 2018-10-06 18:55:30 President is illegitimate & a traitor, Supreme Court majority is stolen, minority-ruled House is product of gerrymandering & vote suppression, minority ruled Senate represents cows and oil wells. Many people will take it’s edicts like Catholics take the Pope’s: under advisement.
2152 2018-10-06 18:55:13 Seeing those “idk whose daughter hasn’t been told this lately but get your oil checked” is the only reason I’m getting an oil change rn lol

2154 2018-10-06 18:54:58 Inflation down due to oil. Now oil risen, so inflation eats the whole growth. On health, an avg kid in India is more malnourished than in N Korea. Point is, we may have been winning battles but we are loosing the war

2159 2018-10-06 18:54:21 What rules? Because his employer had investments in oil? Then half the population is in SEC rule violations. You will get the dump on your face in a $TSLA BK no matter what and you will enjoy it.

I got a 25 mile ride in the morning, and it felt amazing!! 

Long work outs can be harmful to your adrenal glads, so I make sure to support them with herbs and cbd oil.   

Do what you love today.  Get healthy and enjoy the ride! 
2165 2018-10-06 18:53:32 I’m going to learn how to change my own car oil before I turn 30. Why pay when I can learn to do it myself.
2166 2018-10-06 18:53:30 Facts show India's oil import from Iran cannot be fully stopped as US administration plans to Target zero export of Iranian oil. Nevertheless there would be a considerable decrease in the first few months starting from November. #indiairan
2167 2018-10-06 18:53:12 Melania is dressed as J Paul GETTY in the desert looking for oil.
2168 2018-10-06 18:53:09 Hahah you mean celebrating a win. We have more history and so many more wins than you and the oil money from our own grown kids that came through. No come back. Try and find a come back.......

2172 2018-10-06 18:52:46 #Ksa has been protected, so far, by its gigantic oil reserves, neighbouring strong allies and its King’s absolute religious power over his people. You wouldn’t care if Ksa didn’t have these. #Romantictrump
2173 2018-10-06 18:52:43 Did people who love Lotus Biscuits which I 'used' to do until I found that they have 'sustainable'!!! Palm Oil  inside!  Did you know that?
2174 2018-10-06 18:52:31 does it work as growth formula or regular beard oil?
2175 2018-10-06 18:52:15 But the citrus berry oil on the jay I'm boutta fly
2176 2018-10-06 18:52:15 Who cares about food oil  protect it with WD 40
2177 2018-10-06 18:52:10 Chicken deep fried in vegetable oil ? Probably very unhealthy as it’s fried at high temperatures and the oil likely converts to trans fat.
2178 2018-10-06 18:51:49 TBH I love coming to get my car its oil changes bc of the coffee the dealership has. Hits the spot every time
2179 2018-10-06 18:51:43 caligula is so angry with me, i got that salmon oil to put in his food and he hates it. but he's eating it reluctantly and he's pacing himself unwittingly (he'll eat a bit then go back like 15 min later) so it's actually good in more than one way even though he doesn't think so
2180 2018-10-06 18:51:25 @benmaller An amerikan-tax dollars-funded geological survey found no oil reserves on my own property,Ii want to cap all of Texas.Who am I?
2181 2018-10-06 18:51:19 He means it’s going to hurt you. Not the oil executives who will be employed again.
2182 2018-10-06 18:51:06 We live in a time of uncertainty in our country. We are losing our rights, protections and being slowly killed, allowing radiation, toxic fumes mercury, drilling of oil and gas into our environment. This is fascism. We must not let this happen. We must fight hard. Don’t let up.
2183 2018-10-06 18:51:00 use olive oil
2184 2018-10-06 18:50:43 Okay! I just bought ju castor oil w coconut oil so I might I have to try it too!  what’s his mine, right?!
2185 2018-10-06 18:50:41 And that we, as white women, are the spies. We’re the intelligence force. We’re the infiltrators, the saboteurs, the ones who jam the spanner in the gears and pour sand in the oil reservoir and sugar in the gas tank.
2186 2018-10-06 18:50:29 •How to get rid of acne fast

- Another method is to steam your face. Turn the hot water on in the sink and when it's hot put a towel over your head and stand over the sink for 5 minutes
- After you've done this put on acne cream or tea tree oil on your pimples
2187 2018-10-06 18:50:28 Damn that’s bs. But Walmart already charges $40 for regular oil changes and they don’t even change filters. So that doesn’t surprise me. Take your shit somewhere else next time 
2188 2018-10-06 18:50:20 See my problem is I can't stand the taste of actual CBD oil. I've tried other flavors and just can't

Here lies the catch
2190 2018-10-06 18:50:08 Shame on you! Got your big tax break with so-called reform bill & now you've  hurt women - some from your own family I am imagining. You could've gone down in history a hero, not COWARD.  COWARD under every oil painting - IF anyone remembers you at all. @SenBobCorker
2191 2018-10-06 18:49:59 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
2192 2018-10-06 18:49:40 i'm really not the cooking person but i recon a lil coat of "food" oil would be the best when storing it
2193 2018-10-06 18:49:35 exactly, and even by the most aggressive predictions it will be decades before we can hope to go off oil.
2194 2018-10-06 18:49:19 Getting an oil change is all bad for me. The outlets are right across the street, so I end up shopping and spending money that I don’t need to be spending.. 
2195 2018-10-06 18:49:08 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
2196 2018-10-06 18:48:52 Worry about judges here who scuttle oil projects. Will you hold Justin Trudeau to same standard for similar allegations? Recently Trudeau’s demeanour has been tasteless.
2197 2018-10-06 18:48:44 I haven't tried palm kernel oil
2198 2018-10-06 18:48:37 oil changes are the worst ):<
2199 2018-10-06 18:48:30 Ferrero makes it. And palm oil is a great lube.

2201 2018-10-06 18:47:51 And fuck what that other guy wrote...the motherfucker was probably birthed on motor oil by his mama
2202 2018-10-06 18:47:50 Sometimes I'm quite glad I live in the NE of Scotland.  We tend not to go Over the Top about anything and mainly keep a low profile, despite Aberdeen's North Sea Oil keeping them fckg muppets in the South on their Benefits,  Are they grateful? I don't think so. 
2203 2018-10-06 18:47:49 Doesn’t this just mean the market is marking #Canadian #oil as not as needed thereby the price is lower. If the pipeline was operational it would just be sending oil at the same low price to the States, just more of it  ?!
2204 2018-10-06 18:47:36 The future is in clean fuels not fossil fuels and begging the Arabs for oil .
2205 2018-10-06 18:47:31 Just seen a video of people fighting over cooking oil at a mart. 
2206 2018-10-06 18:47:28 James Blunt or Adele ?
2207 2018-10-06 18:47:19 Knowledge of certain processes, but no ability to change them. Thinking — oil tankers and turning.
2208 2018-10-06 18:47:12 A man doesn’t need any drugs at all.
3 minutes is actually enough time for sexual intercourse.
If it was less than a minute, I may worry.

No one should feel less than a man because they release in 3-5mins.
Please remember, you are trying to make love, not drilling for crude oil
2209 2018-10-06 18:47:06 Last night i had a dream that i had a gf that was putting tea tree oil in my hair
2210 2018-10-06 18:46:45 鈍ってる
2211 2018-10-06 18:46:37 Oh okay I see. maybe switch to something more natural/organic! Cetaphil is a awesome cleanser and kielhs toner is amazing, I use that daily. Those aren't super natural brands but still good. Raw Shea butter/coconut oil as a moisturizer might be better for your skin as well.
2212 2018-10-06 18:46:34 Shea butter
Coconut oil
Palm kernel oil
2213 2018-10-06 18:46:25 A friend of mine gave her staffy cbd oil when she discovered she had cancer. The difference was enormous
2214 2018-10-06 18:46:24 dreaming of salt and straw's olive oil ice cream
2215 2018-10-06 18:46:17 Really feel bad
2216 2018-10-06 18:46:10 Thanks! I just got a bottle of jojoba oil that I’ll mix with a few drops of peppermint 
2217 2018-10-06 18:46:09 Sure, once more crude oil can come to market, Iran, Libya, Iraq, Russia, Venezuela all having problems in accessing markets
2218 2018-10-06 18:46:07 Maybe skate it through the neutral zone and offensive blue line then pass? Oil are so predictable
2219 2018-10-06 18:46:05 It is in her face.  She's experiencing a remission of sorts currently, she's been using a CBD oil (no THC) and has had like, entire DAYS without pain.  The change in her is just staggering.
2220 2018-10-06 18:46:03 Oil
2221 2018-10-06 18:45:54 Yup mine too. She hates the BS narrative “speaks for all women.”
2222 2018-10-06 18:45:46 I made a statement about butter being great, not about olive oil being not great :)
2223 2018-10-06 18:45:42 yeah it has to have a layer of oil on it at all times, else it'll rust
2224 2018-10-06 18:45:33 My daughter received an outright untrue mailer from Rick Scott today ... I’ll set the record straight  #Florida Sen Bill Nelson is our environmental champion, fights to keep oil rigs off our beautiful beaches!  If you  #FL vote @NelsonForSenate  not #RedTideRick
2225 2018-10-06 18:45:24 As in, after you're done making food with it, just pour the oil off and wipe clean with paper
2226 2018-10-06 18:45:21 Fukkin Walmart dude, I went in there expecting $20/25 and they said ‘you have a Chevy that’s newer than 2012 so you have to get the expensive oil. Fml.
2227 2018-10-06 18:45:18 between renewing insurance, getting new tires, getting oil change and new air filter, I've spent so much in my car and I don't even want a car.  I hate this.
2228 2018-10-06 18:45:17 Balsam candles from Bath and Body Works and the Happy Buddha shower oil and hand soap from Rituals. SCENTS ABOUND!
2229 2018-10-06 18:45:13 nah, just remember not to use any hard soap plus oil after every washing so it don't rust
2230 2018-10-06 18:45:10 A bot must choose a quality piercer.
A bot must heat three tablespoons of olive oil in a large pan.
A bot must make a slip knot.
2231 2018-10-06 18:44:54 I still have faith.  But come on Oil we need some shots
2232 2018-10-06 18:44:45 How ignorant were you in Opposition. You grabbed power knowing nothing about how oil prices and economy worked. Will be useful to watch a few videos of yourself and your colleagues, incl those of Narendra Modi, prior to 2014. You guys are cheats of the highest order @arunjaitley
2233 2018-10-06 18:44:44 I've heard that the maintenance is basically not maintaining them, burn them in the first time with oil and afterwards you just wipe it clean with paper rather than wash
2234 2018-10-06 18:44:41 The way real Madrid is going down.. They will soon discover oil
2235 2018-10-06 18:44:30 So I saw you mention CBD pen. I don’t smoke weed but I’m very interested in CBD because I’ve heard such good things. Is there a pen that isn’t THC oil and just CBD? That would be wonderful for sleep like you mentioned.
2236 2018-10-06 18:44:27 This occurred last year for fuel oil, and one time over $6gal for gas, we are at reasonable price $5.50 fuel oil and $5.35 or more for gas.

2239 2018-10-06 18:44:23 You must be a stupid as the people demonstrating against it. It will give the UK the same boost as north sea oil, It will make us less reliant on energy imports, more stable energy prices. What evidence to you have to say Fracking is bad.
2240 2018-10-06 18:44:16 Tea tree oil or peppermint oil. But you gotta dilute both before putting it on.
2241 2018-10-06 18:44:08 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
2242 2018-10-06 18:44:08 Price of barrel of crude oil & exchange rates:

Now under Buhari:
$85.03 * N361 = N30,695

Under GEJ:
$85.03 * N150 = N12,754

$110 * N150 = N16,500

So, the Buhari admin is earning almost DOUBLE the amount GEJ earned.

Keep this in mind when they say they made no money.
2243 2018-10-06 18:44:08 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2244 2018-10-06 18:44:05 It's nice not dealing with the hidden issues of ICE vehicles actually- never doing oil changes,  smog checks, going to gas stations, and way less brake wear. Also, suspension complaints were mainly from one guy in Australia.
2245 2018-10-06 18:44:04 You realize that Senator Collins is about as different as oil is to water when compared to the President. What planet are you on. Additionally, Senator Collins demonstrates true courage and constitutional objectivity in her decision.
2246 2018-10-06 18:44:03 The rate at which Real Madrid is going down I fear they may discover oil soon.
2247 2018-10-06 18:43:59 Yarrow herb lowers blood pressure. So does cannabis oil.
2248 2018-10-06 18:43:46 $60 for an oil change? Somebody ripped you off badddd
2249 2018-10-06 18:43:42 @OfficialPDPNig is holding its convention in Port Harcourt thinking that it will give them access to oil wealth. That is the closest they will get to Nigerian oil revenue. 

Nigerians be wise. PDP people are only interested in themselves.
2250 2018-10-06 18:43:37 @Sen_JoeManchin when people look at your oil painting. Wha would you like them to think. 40 years worth of decisions, decisions which could effect your constituents more than they’ve been effected already, god knows WV, has been hit the hardest by many of these health, and

2255 2018-10-06 18:43:06 @orserron Values matter.  This has outstripped a few Saudi princes inflaming tensions(financing rebels) so that the price of oil rises. Last month a tanker in the Red Sea was attacked & Iran had an incident.The Saudi monarchy has to wake upMillions dead, trillions spent. Detente?

2260 2018-10-06 18:42:26 Insider dating tip for everyone: don’t ever take a large dose of MCT oil and turmeric before going on a date. You might end up being a hot mess, but not of the attractive kind.
2261 2018-10-06 18:42:25 Dont sanction iran, iranian economy gains momentum the country prospers and gains influance. Put sanctions on Iran and eu/russia/China goes looking for alternative payment systens, blow up the oil which benefits russia and Venezuela hugely and hurts the us economy hugely
2262 2018-10-06 18:42:23 Don't have an hours number, though I believe many think a monthly check is prudent. As for lubricants I'm partial to sewing machine oil for metal on metal parts.
2263 2018-10-06 18:42:22 I would take Oklahoma’s defense to a pig farm. Lather up the pigs in baby oil and make them catch pigs all day long until they learn how to wrap up.

2267 2018-10-06 18:41:32 Oilers can’t move the puck up ice at all.

2268 2018-10-06 18:41:24 Current score on the #Oilers season opener is 3 - 1 for the #NJDevils so I guess the Mighty Oil is already mathematically eliminated from the playoffs. #yeg #NHL
2269 2018-10-06 18:41:20 It’s to hot out to be waiting for this damn oil change
2270 2018-10-06 18:41:18 पहले crude oil से ज़्यादा पेट्रोल निकलता था। अब crude oil की quality कम हो गयी है तो पेट्रोल भी कम निकलता है। Blame OPEC
2271 2018-10-06 18:41:18 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
2272 2018-10-06 18:41:14 One game only but Nuge needs to be better.  Benning struggling too.  NJ out working the Oil.
2273 2018-10-06 18:41:06 for me I use coconut oil! or castor oil! Works like magic! 2 months my hair started to grow hella! Even my brows and lashes!!
2274 2018-10-06 18:40:49 - Use "oil free" skin products:skin products that are oil free prevent any unwanted oils to go on your face, that can later cause you you to breakout.
- Moisturize:using moisturiser can actually reduce the amount of oil on your face. The body produces oil due to lack of moisture.
2275 2018-10-06 18:40:40 i burnt the roof of my mouth on burning hot oil i have never felt such pain in my face i started crying and my brain thought a good idea would be to just Hold the marinated in bubbling hell vegetables in my mouth rather than eject them out i am ... dumb.

2278 2018-10-06 18:40:19 PSA: Gym equipment that have rubber handles don't require chalk. Unless you're putting baby oil on your hands you should have all the grip you need.

Additionally, chalk is not a substitute for grip strength.

2280 2018-10-06 18:40:10 He sits down and takes out the vial of silence oil again. He'll wait until the plan is properly written but it might soon be time to apply it to his guns.

2283 2018-10-06 18:39:04 Essential oil??
2284 2018-10-06 18:38:45 But yes it does. It uses government to do this stuff for capital's benefit --- for access to oil or markets or resources. Guatemala was undermined by the US CIA for Unite Fruit Company in the 1950s, Arbenz ousted by propaganda and mercenary forces for UFC by the US gov't.
2285 2018-10-06 18:38:35 baby oil!!!

2294 2018-10-06 18:37:15 I personally believe that no elected official should be allowed to play the stock market. If innovations came along that would reduce their profits, they would vote selfishly. This would include oil and gas, pharmaceuticals and chemicals.

2300 2018-10-06 18:36:18 Thank you! Mine is palm oil free :)
2301 2018-10-06 18:36:10 It’s payday. I woke up early bought and put oil in my car. Paid the rest of my bills and then I had a breakfast date by myself
2302 2018-10-06 18:36:06 Josh’s Jeep! He told me that Jack had told him it would be $800 JUST to fix the AC and change oil. We decided to fix the heat first instead and it was only $250. Im thinking Jack told him it would be $800 to fix both heat and AC, but who knows. AC can wait since it’s cooling off!
2303 2018-10-06 18:35:45 О, спасибо, а то я уже испугалась
2304 2018-10-06 18:35:39 I mean, conspiracy theories aside, CBD oil has been really well demonstrated to ease fibromyalgia pain, potentially better than most other medications available. It's FDA approved for it at this point iirc, which was really surprising to find out about.
2305 2018-10-06 18:35:31 He’ll yeah they’re pathetic, they blindly follow an 18 year old college drop out, a Jesus freak, a guy with an unlistenable laugh, and a faceless snake oil salesman. I’ll say the karate kid guy is ok but only out of fear cause trolls are cowards by nature and he might hit me
2306 2018-10-06 18:35:20 CBD Oil burns at a lower heat. There hasn't been any studies showing that it can or can't. It really just depends on how your body reacts to it. I have been vaping my CBD Oil for almost a month and I enjoy being able to have it with me while I'm out in public.
2307 2018-10-06 18:35:16 I got some CBD oil that is for focusing and now I’m trying to perfect contouring my nose
2308 2018-10-06 18:35:07 It will stay on. I usually try not to get it too wet. But swimmers use it when training. When I get out of the shower, I dry it with a blow dryer. I rub it down as it dries. Lasts for days Before needing to be changed, but the skin needs to be clean of oil when applying.
2309 2018-10-06 18:35:04 i love to give massage with loads of babe oil xx

2312 2018-10-06 18:34:36 Sadly. Mr Kenney, you like Doug Ford present no alternative or any semblance of a plan to deal with climate change. Nobody could ever accuse you of bold leadership when one is so beholden to the oil companies

2324 2018-10-06 18:33:45 Ask him if he remembered to apply the castor and argan oil mix I made for him before
2325 2018-10-06 18:33:23 That’s because his life revolves around WWE, probably is into dudes wearing tights, wrestling around wearing oil jerking each other off... don’t stress about him, his opinion stretches as far as the tights on the dudes he’s into

2342 2018-10-06 18:30:47 India reduced its oil imports from Iran solely because of problems in Payment Mechanism, which was the Biggest concern for both INDIA & IRAN bcoz Every payment method we used before was blocked so we were needed to find other ways to bypass hurdles created by US Sanctions on Iran

2348 2018-10-06 18:29:46 Quoted in this article: - Fracking Wastewater: Old Problem Getting Much Bigger
Duke University study concluded that from 2011-2016 the amount of water used to frack oil & gas wells rose 770%. But the amount of toxic wastewater produced in that same time period rose 1,440%.
2349 2018-10-06 18:29:45  Sorry! I didn't made my self clear Red. I know you didn't edit anything. I was saying that to "Tony". He and the other are "the garbage you found". The oil plataform montage with the Antelope's explotion is very low level.
2350 2018-10-06 18:29:38 There's just one thing that I cannot understand

In 2014, AK Antony claimed - We r not able to even purchase a small Jet

In 2018, Modi ji re-paid even the Iran oil debt

Signed Rafale deal & S-400 SAM deal

So the question is
Where did all the money go during the UPA regime ??

Feels gross and it’s the oil so I’m sure that’d make the acne worse.

2375 2018-10-06 18:25:33 1: Thanks for asking, Thomas. Generally, chainsaws are allowed in checked bags. However, if they contain any residue or vapors of gas/oil, they would be considered a hazardous material & prohibited from being transported on the airplane.

2412 2018-10-06 18:20:22 I just accidentally spilled my bfs patchouli on me thinking it was tea tree oil. I’m sorry to anyone who comes in contact w me today
2413 2018-10-06 18:19:49 Spain, you literally tried to make juice out of nothing but olive oil before.

You really think this is beneath you come up with a convoluted plan?
2414 2018-10-06 18:19:48 We have an Oil leak in Sweden. 3-1 Devils
2415 2018-10-06 18:19:47 In our home we use very little sugar, very little salt and very little or no cooking oil at all. A two litre bottle of cooking oil lasts almost a year. If we panic buy we are wondering how much sugar, salt and cooking oil we should panic buy? How much peanut butter and rice? #Zim
2416 2018-10-06 18:19:46 My green apple essential oil just leapt off my desk.

I think I've got a ghost! Yaaaay!
2417 2018-10-06 18:19:43 Slow roasted in foil with seasoning, a drizzle of oil and some thyme. Cooled, peeled and sliced and added to radicchio, chard, little gem leaves, orange segments with roasted goats cheese or chopped chicken is another yummy dish x
2418 2018-10-06 18:19:31 CNN refuse to cover the continuous GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra by British govt and their jihadists to steal oil and gas, but a white helmet is very colonist. Go figure.
2419 2018-10-06 18:19:18 @FoundingFarmers I’m enjoying my @borussia_en team’s dominating performance. Too bad my jersey is ruined from the olive oil dressing your staff covered me with last night. Staff response from my server “Thanks for being cool, bro”.
2420 2018-10-06 18:19:18 I feel like tea tree Oil, shampoo, conditioner, or anything with tea tree oil is a huge HELL NO for my hair. Please tell me I'm not the only one because I'm starting to feel like it

2422 2018-10-06 18:19:13 Hope I’m around to see her voted out of office on her next run. This is how she repaid our President for opening up ANWR to oil drilling and creating huge income for Alaska.

2432 2018-10-06 18:18:25 Evangelicals & other snake oil salesman have been pushing what chris hedges calls "magical thinking" on people in the "heartland" stupifying millions & by extent getting them to vote for & support utterly regressive tripe..
2433 2018-10-06 18:18:23 My family lives in SoCal where there is a lot of natural oil seepage in the ocean that washes up on the beach as tar and gets stuck to your feet. Goo Gone does the trick every time!
2434 2018-10-06 18:18:20 Cry me a river. World is shifting away from fossil fuels. Alberta alone is responsible for mismanagement of the Heritage fund yet still hooked on oil revenues.  Contrast that to Norway who created massive oil wealth for citizens and is now exiting fossil fuel investments.  1/2
2435 2018-10-06 18:18:19 Yeah we’re too poor, got all this oil, power, wind, and water and it’s making us so worthless and sooooo poor
2436 2018-10-06 18:18:18 I usually use applewood with my pork ribs, but didn’t have any, so I went with mesquite. For the rub, I make my own using cumin, smoked paprika, thyme, salt, pepper, olive oil, lime zest, and lime juice

2442 2018-10-06 18:17:53 What’s everyone more annoyed with, CBD oil or detox teas?
2443 2018-10-06 18:17:43 @Toyota damaged my dash doing a recall repair. They called it an eyesore and offered me a free oil change. Not happy right now.
2444 2018-10-06 18:17:42 The way Man Utd is going down they will soon discover OIL
2445 2018-10-06 18:17:33 Chef Kawasaki cut up some Pikmin, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was his first born child, along with grass.
2446 2018-10-06 18:17:32 Yeah the way I do them 
Is soak in water 20
Mins dry them bit of olive oil then put them in pre heated at 140 for about 25 mins get them out give them a shake then about 10 mins at 180 gets them the right colour don’t stink your house out like a old fryer does
2447 2018-10-06 18:17:28 It isn’t deceptive. Pipeline capacity means that the differential to calculate WCS from WTI would shrink (almost $40 right now). If producers wanted they could ship by rail or semi, just that is more costly. So better economics means more oil not pipeline exclusive.

2453 2018-10-06 18:16:25 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, yet back to work in their own country.
2454 2018-10-06 18:16:16 Or leave on for half hour before shampooing. If it's a treatment that you can rinse and not just oil then leave on wet clean hair for 15 mins and then rinse!

2456 2018-10-06 18:15:57 Peppermint oil!! They hate it! Put some in a spray bottle with water and spray it around. Also will make your garden smell lovely.

2461 2018-10-06 18:15:34 @DrLizoSpoons Mam gave me some "candles" as she doesn't use them. Turns out they're oil blocks for an oil burner! 
I'll have to invest in an oil burner now! 
2462 2018-10-06 18:15:32 Perhaps, when written, common decency was assumed to be the oil to that would smooth discourse. Not so common now.I do not advocate baiting to prove your rights but were I in a heated argument with a friend in a protected group and a passerby reports some words i said 
2463 2018-10-06 18:15:18 You are all wrong. An oil line on your jeans is where its at these days.
2464 2018-10-06 18:15:16 I can see the palm oil is affecting your senses.
2465 2018-10-06 18:15:08 Sorry little darlings but this about a lot more than you. It’s about half a TRILLION PER YEAR in tax payer money and about controlling oil fields and routes. So yeah. You can’t match that - you are and will continue to be collateral damage.
2466 2018-10-06 18:15:03 Again, I’m sorry if all you were able to get out of it was MAGIC WAND DERP DE DERP. You people love to imagine Trump as “the doctor who tells you hard truths,” when in reality he’s the snake oil salesman promising easy fixes when Obama offered hard truths you didn’t like.
2467 2018-10-06 18:15:02 There are some essential oil blends,BUT since you are pregnant I wouldn’t dare suggest them.

2518 2018-10-06 18:08:49 @mildredslondon hi guys. Both myself and my wife feel quite unwell after eating in Kings X branch today :( possibly something wrong with cooking oil perhaps?
2519 2018-10-06 18:08:45 This magnolia tissue oil better do the right things. These strechmarks ain't cute.
2520 2018-10-06 18:08:45 So the six oclock dinner was all about their day out. Heard loads and they both said how lovely Brockham was. Ben couldnt get over the bonfire and the small bonfire displays advertising it.
2521 2018-10-06 18:08:42 Oil cleanser lanieige yg trial kit sih heheh
2522 2018-10-06 18:08:26 Aku pakai Johnson's baby yg Almond oil itu. Setauku 24an rb deh.
2523 2018-10-06 18:08:03 My wife digs so long I usually ask if she found the oil yet

2525 2018-10-06 18:07:55 cloudy is usually from being cold enough for fats to solidify, especially if it's never been opened. Its when peanut oil darkens that you want to be concerned about its age
2526 2018-10-06 18:07:50 LOL! Just enabling Utah polluters like Kennecott and the refineries with this garbage. My cooking with olive oil causes my asthma but big polluters are ok? Just more corporate-sponsored propaganda from our so-called DEQ.
2527 2018-10-06 18:07:50 Bout to cop ifuennada’s hair oil.
2528 2018-10-06 18:07:49 Question for the Naturalistas on my TL. 

1. Do y’all do/recommend hot oil treatments? 

2. If so how often? 

3. Moisturizer/Leave-in THEN Oil or vice versa? 

Thanks in advance.
2529 2018-10-06 18:07:47 When my wife sailed with me she and the other wives went up the Andes with a lady who they called Mrs Inca(great imagination) . Had a great time. Meanwhile  I was playing with cargoes of lub oil and arguing with port officials 
2530 2018-10-06 18:07:40 Think what you want, this conversation is pointless, both bands are good, we still won oil bowl
2531 2018-10-06 18:07:40 the cbd in weed is good but the actual smoke isn't. and  you can get cbd for anxiety and pain as an oil. i have nothing against smoking but nobody who does it knows all of the medical things that could go wrong
2532 2018-10-06 18:07:32 If we discovered oil in GAUTENG the other half would be solved. But it ain’t gonna happen.
2533 2018-10-06 18:07:31 Thanks for the Kingsman recommendation!

I used your Referral Code and the Holy Grail Oil, Balm, and Mustache Wax arrived yesterday. 

Put it on this morning and Milady was all over me like a koala on a eucalyptus! Happy happy Iggy. 
2534 2018-10-06 18:07:18 Baking Soda, Apple Cider Vinegar, Coconut Oil and Water are the true and most dearest life hacks.

2535 2018-10-06 18:07:16 Potatoes always remind me of the time my ex’s sister made some potaHOES and she literally served me a plate of oil and half cooked potatoes. I look over to my ex and he’s there enjoying them 
2536 2018-10-06 18:07:15 When asked what I want for my birthday and Christmas, I just tell them the basic essentials: tweezers, socks, coconut oil, a will to live, etc.
2537 2018-10-06 18:07:05 still my soybean not selling. Are more republican principles for sale? I can make money trading those away.
2538 2018-10-06 18:07:01 Isn’t that a stack of cooking oil boxes at the right?
2539 2018-10-06 18:06:56 Too many self proclaimed gurus out there, Coach. Snake oil salesmen promising them they will get recruited if they pay them. Your system is what is real, dedicated hard to the grind. Kids look for the easiest route than blood sweat tears
2540 2018-10-06 18:06:48 You honestly think the oil revenue goes to Holyrood? Really?
2541 2018-10-06 18:06:44 Values matter.  This has far outstripped a few Saudi princes inflaming tensions (financing rebels) so that the price of oil rises. Last month a tanker in the Red Sea was attacked & Tehran had an incident. The Saudi monarchy has to wake up. Millions dead, trillions spent. Detente?
2542 2018-10-06 18:06:42 10,000 HP on the water. These guys are nut. Check it out on CBS. — watching Lucas Oil Drag Boat Racing Series
2543 2018-10-06 18:06:42 A country that with US support that attacked them in a ten year war, that occupies their border for over 1000 miles, that still has a US troop presence and is being plundered for oil reserves. And they want to have some control? Gosh.
2544 2018-10-06 18:06:21 You gave no relief to the common man when crude oil prices were low. Now your explanation is useless. You will get good dividend for your wrong doing in the next general election.

2546 2018-10-06 18:05:44 The death penalty is barbaric as is marrying off young women. No denying this. 

But it isn't Iran I have a problem with. It is you who directly support the barbarity of the US & NATO which brings it about. Iran was a democracy before the US & UK thought oil more important.
2547 2018-10-06 18:05:26 Это относится к дичи
2548 2018-10-06 18:05:25 You and Fabian should invest in some cannabis oil. Maybe bath in it together. It's not healthy hating absolutely everything lads.

2553 2018-10-06 18:05:11 About to get my car's oil changed so.... FUCK IT!
2554 2018-10-06 18:04:47 Maybe you can explain why the "protesters" ALWAYS bother people who aren't likely to kick their asses?

Never a frustrated oil field worker. 

Never a cowboy who is barely making it.

Never a swole up tatted brother that refuses to stay on the dems plantation?

Never me?

Hmmmmm
2555 2018-10-06 18:04:45 "We will remain dependent on Russian Gas AND Iranian Oil"...
2556 2018-10-06 18:04:45 From @jposhaughnessy more than one, but top one was arbitrage human behavior. Back tested by reading some history from boy plunger days. Same act’s: interest rate, gold, boom, bust, oil & what not. What was common in a century, ofcourse human behavior. Same act, different actors.
2557 2018-10-06 18:04:21 Their father Goooooaaaaallllll united for life...
My blood is red
2558 2018-10-06 18:04:13 What if you work in forestry or fishing in BC? Will you protect us from the oil industry and work on softwood lumber issues? Kidding we get it, you've already sold us out.
2559 2018-10-06 18:04:12 Rising national debt increase gas and oil prices food prices outrageous no solution for entitlements oh yeah they are doing a great job
2560 2018-10-06 18:04:02 Why don't the Govt asks not to drive pvt vehicles for some days like sudden note bandi. Demand of crude oil will reduce and hence the prices too. Also it's better for environment, health and fitness of people.
2561 2018-10-06 18:03:54 it is failure of state to let the flith spread. THIS is where we need actual cleaning-drive.
2562 2018-10-06 18:03:53 I give Kova a Fish Oil pill every day & I just witnessed him hide it behind the couch so I moved the couch & found a stash of pills 
2563 2018-10-06 18:03:48 On the weekends I like to do a coconut oil treatment on my hair but it always makes me feel like a greasy fuck lmao
2564 2018-10-06 18:03:30 I just started getting them on my boobs and now they’re turning a dark pink it’s the worst!!! I heard coconut oil does wonders but never tried it yet
2565 2018-10-06 18:03:27 slapped coconut oil
2566 2018-10-06 18:03:21 I always like taking oregano oil for my throat. It helps a lot.
2567 2018-10-06 18:03:13 "SDF" are now an occupying force, Emmanuel. Many of those "ISIS" elements are anti USA groups who are pro-Syrian Government.We saw that since 2017 when USA sent special forces to take oil wells from Syria. ISIS elements were transported by USA to Idlib in 2017 after Raqqa fell
2568 2018-10-06 18:03:13 Happening now in #Nanaimo, people are furious as homeless people squat in an empty school as they scramble to find shelter. Happening across BC, people are silently oblivious that we are giving billions to oil/gas and paying tens of billions over market rates for energy. #bcpoli
2569 2018-10-06 18:03:11 Unless all Som Oil constraints are exploited and sent to dust pins Somalia will remain the same as a failed state.
2570 2018-10-06 18:03:06 Why did the oil monarch do after a socialist revolution hit Switzerland?
2571 2018-10-06 18:03:02 And disappears....as fluid as oil in water. Otterly wonderful!
2572 2018-10-06 18:02:56 Just copped one of those oil pens, I’m slapped g

2576 2018-10-06 18:02:41 (1/2) Our fruit essence is just a highly concentrated flavor that is extracted from the named fruit as stated on the label. In the case of citrus essences, fruit essence comes from the oil extracted from the peel of the fruit.
2577 2018-10-06 18:02:34 Hahaha I told my Dad I was having horrible cramps so he came to me and dropped canna oil under my tongue I luv him

2579 2018-10-06 18:02:16 Pour the boiling oil on the peasants now! 
The nerve they think I will listen to them!
2580 2018-10-06 18:01:59 Simple answer, "Yes." Facts don't matter to Pres. Trump.
Acting Admin. Wheeler is acting in the best interests of coal and oil, not the American people. He's privatizing profit and socializing costs.
His actions demonstrate a blatent rejection of the actual mission of the EPA.
2581 2018-10-06 18:01:58 Maybe if they didn't treat him so poorly he would have been a swing vote, but after this circus...

2584 2018-10-06 18:01:44 I just realized I forgot to take my wallet out of my car before I dropped it off for an oil change...
2585 2018-10-06 18:01:42 I just had a panic attack trying to get an oil change so that's how my day's going
2586 2018-10-06 18:01:26 market forces in my comment referred to OPEC and the change in oil prices.
2587 2018-10-06 18:01:16 You failed to answer why Modiji froze oil price as per his wish according to his convenience, during elections near
2588 2018-10-06 18:01:12 Is South Africa ever owned oil and if so what happened to it just find out for me.

2590 2018-10-06 18:00:43 I totally understood that—and you’re right! And the tape holding down the IVs, ugh.  Last time I got out of the hospital, I had to use like half a bottle of baby oil to get all the nasty tape residue off  Hope you’re feeling better.
2591 2018-10-06 18:00:37 In human rights law, freedom of expression has never (!) meant the right to abuse people or defame them or sell them snake oil that will kill them.
2592 2018-10-06 18:00:26 Sorry, Matty. As I read the Bible, I don't see a fraction of the nonsense you're trying to peddle for cheap money. I'm not buying your snake oil.

2600 2018-10-06 17:59:41 No. Our finances are worse the  Greece was. For that reason tax would go sky high and services cut. Membership of EU would also be a no given the above. Oil is not going to save us. A lot more thought needs to be given to this. More than flag waving.
2601 2018-10-06 17:59:32 Changed the breaks & oil and washed my car. Man it feels like a brand new car

2604 2018-10-06 17:59:20 Only 3500 crores worth oil bonds are matured and paid by this govt in 4.5 years. Rest will mature only after 2022. Whatsapp is not a authorised source information. This govt is built on lies, living on lies and will die on lies.
2605 2018-10-06 17:59:15 @nelsonchamisa but another thing I can't see the change in Zim it's started with bread now it's cooking oil and petrol ya'll please do something better n don't be lyk Mr Robert 
2606 2018-10-06 17:59:15 The US military is the world's largest customer for oil. The longer the academic community chooses to remain within its own bubble, the more you will talk to yourselves. 

Care about your fellow human first.
2607 2018-10-06 17:59:13 It was so inspiring to hear Senator Collins,  my comment with all theses allegations I AM AFRAID FOR WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE, will I get passed by as a women out of mens fear of false allegations that will ruin them.  I work in Oil and Gas predomentaly men   is MY FUTURE SAFE??

2609 2018-10-06 17:59:03 What exactly would the left be signaling by this? Is part of a thousand year propaganda campaign against paper products and oil.
2610 2018-10-06 17:59:01 having a car is really a luxury -regardless of what car it is you are driving. Gotta have your tags $ &renew them every so often, gotta have insurance $, gotta have gas to drive around $, don’t forget maintenance -oil change, Oh there goes a flat tire $, naw where the bus at???
2611 2018-10-06 17:58:58 In otherwords we can't viably access fossil fuels reserves in the area or the cost associated with recovery isn't viable. No oil company does anything  for goodwill
2612 2018-10-06 17:58:56 will u let me rub oil on ur bald head
2613 2018-10-06 17:58:55 Semacam minyak / oil - oilan. Ada banyak bgt variannya. Kalau tertarik bisa DM yaa kak. Makasih -ns
2614 2018-10-06 17:58:49 Allah ya bashi lafia
2615 2018-10-06 17:58:45 Thats why we want our independence, so that all the oil revenues do go to Holyrood.
Right now they go to Westminster so they can pay for nuclear weapons they'll never use and store them on our doorstep.

2620 2018-10-06 17:58:10 Confluence of escalating US 10 year yields, higher oil prices, trade tensions and rising dollar may create opportunities for the long-term equity investors.
2621 2018-10-06 17:58:05 @MonroAutoTire Spent 3 days at store 1313. I am not happy about the service.  I witnessed multiple people come back with issues about there cars after just an oil change.  I was told that it is not common.  Funny it all happened while I was there. To be continued.
2622 2018-10-06 17:57:56 You appear to be always right. I'm curious what @jkenney will do with C tax. Will he abolish it and then put in a PST? I mean how will he address cash flow problems at @YourAlberta ? Even if he fires everyone he will make more cash from gambling than oil. @OilGasCanada Any ideas?
2623 2018-10-06 17:57:56 Elle woods just walked in to where I’m getting my oil changed 
2624 2018-10-06 17:57:55 Would I be ok with a bus full of women on the Hawaiian Tropic Bikini Tour asking me to be their oil boy? And paying me a billion dollars to do so? That subtle enough for you?
2625 2018-10-06 17:57:53 They makes Vicks with lavender oil in it. I’m about to bathe in it
2626 2018-10-06 17:57:52 Haha, I replaced my oil pan gasket and the fucker wasn’t even snug and had a huge gap in the pan...
2627 2018-10-06 17:57:51 Congrats man and go oil go
2628 2018-10-06 17:57:51 The Oil also missed the chance to surprise everyone when they had the Gretzky statue cleaned up, by unveileing a Messier statue at the same time
2629 2018-10-06 17:57:14 Just went to 3 shops looking for some neck oil and failed. A poor day by all accounts
2630 2018-10-06 17:57:09 Honorable prime minister of our country launched a new scheme -"Scalding oil,Sliding rupee"??
2631 2018-10-06 17:57:08 Once there is clarity with smart contracts for the blockchain throne, then we will work in this direction.
2632 2018-10-06 17:57:07 Mr Kenney assigns blame, dispels myths, fails to see the Koch Brothers influence to landlock Alberta’s oil and panders to an Ontario Premier hell bent on destabilizing society norms. This brand of conservatism is wrong and misguided for its lack of vision to the common good.
2633 2018-10-06 17:57:04 Its whack. Normal olive oil required.
2634 2018-10-06 17:57:00 Cant imagine when the oil price dropped to $26? It would have been worse under a Con gov’t because you would have decimated health and education as well. Your “it’s gonna hurt” rhetoric doesn’t suggest you’d be better.  So I can imagine worse under #UCP. #ableg #LakeOfFireParty
2635 2018-10-06 17:56:47 Getting an oil change is sitting in a awkward waiting room trying not to look up at the creeper staring at you.
2636 2018-10-06 17:56:46 @BootsHelp please can you tell me if the palm oil you use in your sandwiches and cakes is sustainable. Thanks
2637 2018-10-06 17:56:26 In 2014 I advised the leadership of a major Cdn oil co that if they wanted public support for pipelines they had to take climate change seriously, support a carbon tax, and make a major mitigation commitment such as to reforest Haiti!
2638 2018-10-06 17:56:09 My prayers are with you. Get wel soon
2639 2018-10-06 17:55:53 Eww thatd cause a guido oil slick thatd wipe out half of all those birds you always see that they soak in palmolive afterwards.
2640 2018-10-06 17:55:51 The irony here is that this is in Rifle, Colorado near where I live. It is the reddest of red part of Colorado, with the main economy being oil and gas drilling. We rely on huge amounts of labor from Mexico, Central and South America, yet racism persists.
2641 2018-10-06 17:55:42 update 4 : mom and kim are sleeping beside wawai.. daddy also.. I sit outside with my bro..and he is sleeping also now..on the floor.. I check her once a while..her forehead is cold.. assuming the blood in her head already went far.. i just wipe the oil on her face..

2644 2018-10-06 17:55:37 I have tinctures but I felt the most effective were the cbd oil pill/gels or gummies. Around 25mg tablets is what works for me but everybody is different
2645 2018-10-06 17:55:33 In some pain with my wisdom tooth..
Grandad: have some clove oil to numb it darling.
5 seconds after rubbing this clove oil on my tooth, I’m running to back door drooling and spitting it out.

Most vile thing that’s being in my mouth so far
2646 2018-10-06 17:54:54 Just like there's no excuse for not choosing water, salt, pepper, garlic, onion, oil on the "guess the ingredients in this dish" challenge after 11 years!
2647 2018-10-06 17:54:44 What a trip! Anthea I said CBD oil without the THC
2648 2018-10-06 17:54:42 ? My oil changes always take a half hour, even going to a valvoline
2649 2018-10-06 17:54:31 Americans have become a burden on mother nature....they are No 1 in per capita consumption of oil.........they are also No 1 in per capita consumption of plastic ....they are also No 1 in WARS....... are they part of solution or they are problem themselves
2650 2018-10-06 17:54:17 I have to get my cars oil changed but I dont wanna go to the dealer

2653 2018-10-06 17:53:56 Hello!
Everything is very simple. Today, only the manual distribution mode is possible, or the distribution of dividends with the help of a bot to the token holders is proportional to their contribution.
2654 2018-10-06 17:53:56 Talbots looks fantastic .I can breathe now @Oil_Drop @Oil_Drop @loc8ingoil @KurtLeavins @dstaples @JimRoepckeOilrs @James_Tanner123
2655 2018-10-06 17:53:46 I have had a good day so far but being out and about still takes its toll on my formerly broken foot. Plus, bronchitis is still kinda kicking my ass. So I'll spend the next hour or so in the tub with cocoa butter, vanilla & macadamia-scented bath oil & a banana hair mask. 
2656 2018-10-06 17:53:44 First period thoughts:
- 1st shot 1st goal nightmares continue
- PP goal keeps Oil in it
- Devils controlled play far too long that period
2657 2018-10-06 17:53:40 Bitch this why I need a man  somebody come check my oil
2658 2018-10-06 17:53:28 There's just one thing that I cannot understand

In 2014, AK Antony claimed - We r not able to even purchase a small Jet

In 2018, Modi ji re-paid even the Iran oil debt

Signed Rafale deal & S-400 SAM deal

So the question is
Where did all the money go during the UPA regime ??
2659 2018-10-06 17:53:17 Am I the only one who heard ntate Nene say, his son is in the oil business @JamesT28251469 @AdvBarryRoux @Julius_S_Malema go diragalang mara heh

2664 2018-10-06 17:52:38 Then they obviously  need our oil and LNG, much cleaner than coal.
2665 2018-10-06 17:52:36 As per RBI policy now on borrowing from overseas: it allowed state owned fuel retailers to raise up to 10 billion USD external debt for working capital reqmnt. In past, Oil marketing companies were allowed  to working capital raised thru external commercial borrowing.
#DAccting
2666 2018-10-06 17:52:36 MMS issued bonds to oil companies which this Govt had to pay off. What really matters is overall inflation and that has been under control.
2667 2018-10-06 17:52:24 It is CBD oil. I have little cbd tablets. Also have an oil tincture.
2668 2018-10-06 17:52:14 CHINA HAS REMOVED ITS 25% TARIFF ON OIL

WHY ISN'T THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA TALKING ABOUT THIS? BECAUSE IT'S A BIG WIN FOR PRES TRUMP?
2669 2018-10-06 17:52:14 Anybody in town have peppermint oil?

2671 2018-10-06 17:51:51 Yet she was all cuddly when President Trump campaigned for her in 2016 and celebrated the ANWAR OIL DEAL !She was standing at the podium all sweet and happy ! FAKE REPUBLICAN   #MAGA
2672 2018-10-06 17:51:50 Heroic levels of effort? Both the Liberals and the Conservatives are in the pocket of big oil. The only effort they are willing to put in is lying to us.
2673 2018-10-06 17:51:34 Ben just drinks straight vegetable oil now. Cut out the filler
2674 2018-10-06 17:51:32 A political gift is all the Mitch gets from NRA and Oil companies, though they do expect something in return.

2676 2018-10-06 17:50:53 @SGR4NM - teacher, legislator, step-in kind of leader, full-of-fire candidate w/a terrific campaign. She's working hard on o&g policy right now, she's speaking to the NM Oil & Gas Asso. in a couple of weeks, she's the New Mexico Land Commissioner we've needed for a long time.
2677 2018-10-06 17:50:52 I see the refs are full pro oil already in this one.
2678 2018-10-06 17:50:51 I'm no mechanic or anything but I know like hell it shouldn't take a whole 2.5hours for an oil change and tire rotation

2682 2018-10-06 17:50:38 I was shunned from the ages of 4 to 6 bc I didn’t save the excess tuna oil from the can.
2683 2018-10-06 17:50:37 Can't believe my favourite pizza has gone  - goats cheese, roquito cherry peppers, fresh rocket and chilli oil on a thin crispy base.  Went to order it tonight and it's no more  Forced to try another pizza delivery company....
2684 2018-10-06 17:50:36 There are a lot of different CBD brands out there, and I’ve tried quite a few as of recently , but I’ve noticed significant difference in my anxiety levels since I started taking the oil.
2685 2018-10-06 17:50:36 You know over the years I am listening that there is an #oil deficit so buy oil and then it falls 80$. Then listening for two years how equities will fall and #spx is up 50%. Now we are listening about the bond bear market, the #dxy to 107 and #eur the parity.
2686 2018-10-06 17:50:27 But in Dr.Singh's tenure even much higher was the price of crude oil,but INR did not fall to to-day's level.
2687 2018-10-06 17:50:10 I like the infused rye, but maybe peanut butter instead of peanuts. Pickle juice whiskey sour has promise. Maybe olive oil (instead of mayo) and bacon salt rim on the glass, garnish with bacon and a few drops of olive oil? IDK, could be crazy enough to work, or just horrid.
2688 2018-10-06 17:50:01 Made me want to get a spray can and cross it out. 

But I won’t stoop to their levels of juvenile vandalism and criminality
2689 2018-10-06 17:49:49 Yes ma’am. Olive oil salmon. All the healthy fats

2692 2018-10-06 17:49:46 I love the way coconut oil makes my hair look
2693 2018-10-06 17:49:14 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
2694 2018-10-06 17:49:13 make-up will not hide your ugliness inside
just like if you put extra virgin olive oil on yourself doesnt make you not a whore

*wink wink*
2695 2018-10-06 17:49:08 Every one of those Traders you just mentioned also has stock in major pharmaceutical companies and other corporations including banking industries that run and own our currency oil and other commodities double-dealing to places like a ran using the American people as their ATM!!
2696 2018-10-06 17:49:07 Sarah McCain Palin is a fake conservative. Look at what she did to the oil industry in Alaska through her progressive tax scheme.
2697 2018-10-06 17:48:45 Personally i use carrot oil or coconut oil for my hair not that big a fan of argon but its still good
2698 2018-10-06 17:48:44 To be honest I’d rather watch my club in real turmoil that watch oil money all day every day!
2699 2018-10-06 17:48:35 Oil change  just need to pack and then vacation mode will be in full effect!
2700 2018-10-06 17:48:32 THESE are pro-big oil's 'sources'. Just a reminder that renewable energy has been 'on-hold' since the day I was born 41 years ago. Imagine the jobs and free energy we'd have if we progressed. PS. Please repost this in 40 years. Thx.
2701 2018-10-06 17:48:30 Asking if it was made in Peanut or Olive Oil
2702 2018-10-06 17:48:25 I drank vegetable oil from the bottle once when I was extremely drunk. I thought it was a bottle of juice. Eugh!

I’m on this mom group on Facebook & they said if I rub lavender essential oil and mix it with eucalyptus under your armpits it’s more of a preventative
2714 2018-10-06 17:46:31 All I wanted from my birthday was car insurance and an oil change.
2715 2018-10-06 17:46:26 My dogs swarm me like Spice addicts when they hear me cracking open the coconut oil lid, they love it!
2716 2018-10-06 17:46:10 Are you nuts? The Democrats started this turnaround, and if anything, Trump is slowing it with his deficit-building, huge tax cuts for the rich, tariffs and I’ll conceived oil policy raising our gas prices through the roof.
2717 2018-10-06 17:46:03 The way Manchester United is going down, they will soon discover oil.

2735 2018-10-06 17:44:32 3) forgot your costs question. In short, too much. It only works if part of a full biorefinery using all of the algae, just like fossil fuel refineries use all of the oil. However, if it's a sewerage treatment works based system it could work financially too
2736 2018-10-06 17:44:12 I think I like CBD oil more than weed.
2737 2018-10-06 17:44:01 Just like ke if you are All Qaeda and the anted to finance Terrorism, you'd buy Oil from Iran, stockpile it, then sell it to say Exxon through 3rd Party Fulfillment Contractors.

2747 2018-10-06 17:42:54 Sloppy first period by the Oil. Definitely those first game jitters
2748 2018-10-06 17:42:46 @FoodNetwork watching yesterday’s @thekitchen and I am very disappointed in the guest cook promoting coconut oil as healthy and a good weight loss choice. It is horrible for you and continuing the lie is irresponsible!!!
2749 2018-10-06 17:42:44 Surely that's vegetable oil?
2750 2018-10-06 17:42:25 Looks like you’re on your own. Oil your hair the day before. It will go a lot faster. I use coconut oil. But any oil will do.
2751 2018-10-06 17:42:06 I get that. I just remember when I did put like an oil under one it made them like reallllly weird, so if anything I’ll put chapstick on before I do my face so by then it’s kinda gone when I put lipstick on

2758 2018-10-06 17:41:02 Insult? "Little buddy," is a term of endearment. Interesting how a Pallister political appointee is on Twitter going after a tax-payer. Are you claiming that workers in alternative energy don't pay taxes? Are you claiming that the oil industry can't afford to pay it's employees?

2769 2018-10-06 17:40:12 サラダ油って体に悪いんですか？サラダなのに？
2770 2018-10-06 17:39:50 How much oil is used in the production of the cars?
2771 2018-10-06 17:39:49 That oil change really be hitting
2772 2018-10-06 17:39:48 That’s the ultimate plan petrodollars for Putin. Economy is at 1969 levels when inflation was rampant and oil went from 3.per barrel to 400 in 1970-economists are not happy.
2773 2018-10-06 17:39:47 It’s already time for another oil change 
2774 2018-10-06 17:39:44 I have a feeling that despite all the lime oil I added I’m gonna smell of palm kernel oil.
2775 2018-10-06 17:39:44 try lavender oil - miracle skin soother - good luck

2780 2018-10-06 17:38:39 Same with American oil! For many decades my family and friends have worked in the oil and natural gas industry, we've seen the best and worst of the market and I want to see everything produced in the USA, in all markets across the board.
2781 2018-10-06 17:38:31 Mr @JustinTrudeau, instead of a carbon tax, why not simply limit how much oil/gas can be drilled o imported each year, reducing that limit every year to reach target? Let the market decide price of oil.
Oil companies sell less volume but at greater price.
 cc @ElizabethMay
2782 2018-10-06 17:38:02 No offense, but that sounds like the mantra of the oil and coal companies. 
Along with the tobacco companies. 
And the gun lobby. 
And....
2783 2018-10-06 17:37:59 Except if you are in the oil sector in Alberta.
2784 2018-10-06 17:37:58 I’m curious about What CBD Oil is best for and who on here uses it... what do you think? Does it truly help?? Thoughts?
2785 2018-10-06 17:37:55 The way Man utd are going down, they will soon discover oil #mufc
2786 2018-10-06 17:37:54 I like that it looks as if @TJ_Derrick  is selling the stuff. "ROLL UP! ROLL UP! THE FINEST PERFUMES THIS SIDE OF THE TIBER!  Don't believe me legate? Please have a sniff. For only a sesterius a jar you'll have Spanish oil AND the very best herbs and spices."
2787 2018-10-06 17:37:38 Made myself some mix for my skin. I mixed in palm kernel oil, Shea butter, marula, jojoba, grape seed, lime oil to make it smell nice 
2788 2018-10-06 17:37:25 After a stressful day, I like to have a glass of essential oil and unwind. You drink it right? Idk

2793 2018-10-06 17:36:55 Not quite. The low oil price bonus was a known temporary for the #NDA. 
FM @arunjaitley had 4.5 years to prepare the economy for it. In several ways FM did a good job (lowered deficit budgets). Although in a few important areas FM has obviously failed. -- #IGES

2796 2018-10-06 17:36:51 Roughly $400 for an oil change a fuel filter and air filter change  who knew you had to be a millionaire to own a diesel
2797 2018-10-06 17:36:49 And does not arrive in your local store without oil.
2798 2018-10-06 17:36:38 Sending you gentle hugs bro. Aspercreme with lidocaine and cbd oil has been taking the edge off for me lately if you haven’t tried either yet.
2799 2018-10-06 17:36:36 I feel like I just swallowed some Oil on that hit...
2800 2018-10-06 17:36:32 Govt has yielded to tax cuts demand and cut by Rs.5. If by the time the votes are cast, Crude prices rise by Rs.5, what is Modi Govt going to do? Ask oil companies to bear  the increase and not pass it on?
2801 2018-10-06 17:36:31 Nigga had a oil spill smoothie
2802 2018-10-06 17:36:31 Western Coast of Scotland oil and gas exploration and recovery.
2803 2018-10-06 17:36:24 That was a great story! We followed a recipe, measured the water & oil and even discussed fractions and voila made microwaveable brownies #makinglearningfunandrelevant
2804 2018-10-06 17:36:19 Well sir, you may say so, but what about when the crude oil price was low? You intentionally did not reduce the oil price to rob citizens after claiming tax collection is rising. What a joke? Now that you feel unsafe you are forced to reduce it.
2805 2018-10-06 17:36:11 Need oil
2806 2018-10-06 17:36:01 I’m getting an oil change and we’re all being chismosos because someone’s getting arrested on the side of the road.
2807 2018-10-06 17:35:34 Everything we use is made with or somehow impacted by oil .

2809 2018-10-06 17:35:26 This azwipe looks just like a snake oil salesman. Talks like one, too. 
2810 2018-10-06 17:35:21 Was driving down Aranguez Main Road and saw a guy throw a bucket of sludge filled motor oil into the drain at the side of the road, not that idiots like him would use it but is there an oil recycling facility here?

2814 2018-10-06 17:34:48 There will be no oil tankers being loaded from the #TMX out of Westridge, nor will the oil tanker ban be lifted from the North Coast.
2815 2018-10-06 17:34:45 Before twitter one literally had to travel to sell snake oil.  Now it’s just a few taps on a keyboard.

2817 2018-10-06 17:34:36 Challenge accepted! It’s not hard. Nearly every “scientist” who says climate change/global warming isn’t happening is funded by or connected to oil, pollution, corporate interests.
2818 2018-10-06 17:34:27 I hate when I get a pedicure and they put too much oil on my feet. My patas be sliding around in my chanclas.
2819 2018-10-06 17:34:21 I'll bring some of my homemade body oil mixes that smell divine and also repels all manner of stinging/biting insects.

They will be like a well-watered garden, 
and they will sorrow no more.

2827 2018-10-06 17:33:46 And primrose oil is just a soft gel vitamin. I got mine from rite aid. The tea from the vitamin shoppe
2828 2018-10-06 17:33:36 I was always puzzled by Obama’s hesitancy about KXL position. He finally opposed it but why not sooner? Maybe Canadian relationships or to be less dependent on Middle Eastern oil. Easy to forget he was embroiled in wars there during much of his first term.
2829 2018-10-06 17:33:24 Essential oil diffuser-frankense with lavender
2830 2018-10-06 17:33:24 Kale smoothies, coconut oil, apple cider vinegar to alkalise the blood...
2831 2018-10-06 17:33:14 I started the tea @ 26 weeks, you just drink it how ever much you want. And the primrose oil you can take orally or prick a hole in it and put it up at close to your cervix as possible. I started that @ 27 weeks. Both help to prepare for labor. I googled it 
2832 2018-10-06 17:33:09 Peppermint oil, eucalyptus oil, and cinnamon. Mix a teaspoon of each into 1/2 cup of water, put in a cheap spray bottle and spray it on there liberally, wait 30 min, spray again. Should take the smell out.
2833 2018-10-06 17:33:08 The way man united are going down ehnnn dey will soon discover oil
2834 2018-10-06 17:33:08 i swear by fish oil i take it every day x
2835 2018-10-06 17:33:04 The irony in this Manitoban's eyes is how a lot of anti-oil people do not make the connection of oil to auto. Even if all autos were electric, oil would still be needed for manufacturing of every day household items.
2836 2018-10-06 17:32:54 Is it me or does coconut oil have you smelling like a whole snack?
2837 2018-10-06 17:32:51 #ItsNormalForMeTo o
But you do it without baby oil...
2838 2018-10-06 17:32:40 No we don’t. We import oil in the East, mainly from the US. We export oil in the West, almost exclusively to the US. The price difference is less that $15 / barrel and that’s due to the distance bitumen needs to travel to get to Gulf refineries, that have the ability to refine it
2839 2018-10-06 17:32:38 Heres the formula again: Interest free loans to business and home owners for Solar Panel Installation. Hurts Oil in market share,Provides cleaner air,Produces growth of NEW technology and JOBS, world markets are created, changes political power, Gasoline is made cheap again !
2840 2018-10-06 17:32:23 Try a tincture or eat some oil in or on something. Lasts all day.
2841 2018-10-06 17:32:14 I say try him on CBD oil.  I've got my dog on it for an immune disorder but I don't do it on a regular basis so it hasn't fixed him but it has helped a lot.
2842 2018-10-06 17:31:56 TBH I don't even eat the fries (too much oil)
2843 2018-10-06 17:31:52 Very similar to my knowledge of Greek after a year on one of their oil tankers....I was warned not to speak Greek if I went to Greece.....

2845 2018-10-06 17:31:34 The way man utd is going down they will soon discover crude oil
2846 2018-10-06 17:31:30 What this govt missed is they could've created some buffer out of windfall gain of lower oil so as to subsidise it now instead of passing on fully to common men now. 
Also higher one time diesel cess for 15lac +value vehicles could've saved a bit for them
2847 2018-10-06 17:31:25 Wash you face for 60 seconds! 
hum the Fresh Prince theme song to keep time lol.

2855 2018-10-06 17:29:15 She is not a Republican. Stop calling her that, it's so damn irritating. Her voice and attitude is like washing your hair with boiling oil.

2861 2018-10-06 17:28:06 Yes indeed my friend however we do have bigger fish 2 fry I have hot oil waiting 4 all of them and give the proceeds to putin
2862 2018-10-06 17:28:05 Oil companies want to destroy our beaches....
And despite giving them huge tax breaks and deregulation.....prices at the pump remain high.

Then they want taxpayers to pay for red tides, oil slicks and diminished tourism.
2863 2018-10-06 17:28:01 Oh my god , I just took a big hit off my oil pen and I’m high as fuck dude , do it 
2864 2018-10-06 17:27:59 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
2865 2018-10-06 17:27:53 Set you a rich oil cunt!

2869 2018-10-06 17:27:05 How many NGOs publish their balance sheet publicly in India today. And only if our great PM and FM had applied some mind to ILFS, Oil Prices and falling rupee instead of choking and joking.
2870 2018-10-06 17:26:54 Dose they have the same colonial inherited ,this was what Foncha was preaching in 1961. Dr Endeley said they cannot mex water with oil ,listen to foncha speech in 1995 in YouTube you will understand that he regret.
2871 2018-10-06 17:26:49 mines full of THC extract and CBD oil
2872 2018-10-06 17:26:48 Yup, Kenny will come in and wave a magic wand and dictate the world price of oil. He will also force other provinces to put their costal industries and environment at risk.
Kenny is king.
Yawn... Spare the separation threats already.
2873 2018-10-06 17:26:44 Iya, kan oil control
2874 2018-10-06 17:26:42 "... coming to destroy Venezuela"? As if Venezuela isn't already destroyed. Venezuelans only care about scarce food and medicine, not oil and gas, that is why more than 90% of Venezuelans actually welcome any invading force, specially if it is from the US.

2919 2018-10-06 17:21:43 61% of our oil imports come from the USA. Most of our oil is exported to the USA. Most of our imports are just our own oil refined & sold back to us.
2920 2018-10-06 17:21:42 Meanwhile you take kickbacks from oil companies. I'd call that a bribe. Scumbag.

2923 2018-10-06 17:21:24 I have MG, and cannabis oil really helps. I can take less Mestinon, which is great because it has gastro side effects that are really annoying.  I put it in my turmeric-ginger tea at night. No late stiffness, no foggy mornings because of an NSAID.

2939 2018-10-06 17:20:07 I think nuclear will see a huge improvement soon. Natural gas is still a fuel to be burned. It will still cause environmental damage if pipeline or train accident. Why no oil pipeline again?
2940 2018-10-06 17:19:57 Sir....November 04th the sanctions from US come in place for Iran...we can either keep buying as the newspaper reported or find alternatives...in case we do go with purchase from Iran...what happens when the sanctions are imposed on us...whether on Oil or the Russian deal?
2941 2018-10-06 17:19:55 Senator DeWine, you have got to do something about the recent ban on CBD oil, that was an acted by a body that in my opinion had no authority to do so. This is what's kept me alive, and is no doubt doing so for other people. This is unacceptable!

2951 2018-10-06 17:18:42 How much did oil companies get in subsidies and tax breaks during the same period, little buddy? By the way, those royalties are what you pay for our oil, not a tax or contribution. Or when you go to a store is the merchandise free?
2952 2018-10-06 17:18:26 I agree. I think currently oil companies might be hedging a part of their purchase. However, even if they hedge the total import, I'm not sure to what extent it will succeed in insulating oil price from excess swings.

2958 2018-10-06 17:18:01 When I see these pictures my brain automatically defaults to the smell of patchouli oil and cat piss.
2959 2018-10-06 17:18:00 Look at a map. Just because BC has plenty of options for hydro does not mean that every province does. Besides, oil is used for quite a bit more than just for making fuel.
2960 2018-10-06 17:17:53 I can’t believe white ppl spend their lives tryna get oil outta their hair and we put oil in
2961 2018-10-06 17:17:43 I was riding to my friends house. Most ppl be like “oh I need gas” on the way and pump. But my ass was like “oh I need a whole ass oil Change. & been here for over an hour. My friend prolly pissed. Lmaoo.
2962 2018-10-06 17:17:31 I see the Oil are content with continuing the “give up a goal on the first shot” trend.
2963 2018-10-06 17:17:29 Mozzarella, basil & olive oil topping. My dad had mushroom, truffle oil and mozzarella. They did have like.. prosciutto and things for the meat eaters. But all handmade to order and cooked in a wood-fired oven

2971 2018-10-06 17:16:49 Try planting Mint, Basil or Lavender along the pumpkin vines, if you can. Most bugs hate them. You can also try an organic insecticide or repellant like Neem Oil or the essential oils of Mint, Basil and Lavender. I planted basil with each one of my plants and had very few pests!
2972 2018-10-06 17:16:49 There is a real good reason for parliament to refuse to sign his..they should not control my country with whom I look to for a deal..now that this seems to be coming forward I hope people speak up..this was hidden till now..you will not control our oil or natural gas

2984 2018-10-06 17:15:13 When the Tories took office in May 1979, unemployment was falling and the economy growing. Living standards had gone up by a sixth in two years, and North Sea oil held out the prospect of economic growth, high levels of employment and better social services. +
2985 2018-10-06 17:15:10 The best advice and who to give is President @edmnangagwa because he is the interim leader of this country. Why do you focus on losers. I just checked Pure Gold 2 litres Cooking oil at Unit L shops, Chitungwiza it's going for $10, mayors and councillors vanodii ipapa?
2986 2018-10-06 17:15:09 Totally agree with you, plant deserves freedom and we deserve freedom to use it, however please don't go around saying that CBD is snake oil without speaking to the community yourself. THC is fantastically therapeutic for many, but a lot of people cant handle the effects
2987 2018-10-06 17:14:51 My lil ugly ass need an oil change
2988 2018-10-06 17:14:45 @MHSuperstore Have been waiting  for an appointment that I made at 11:20 for an oil change, wiper blade change and for a brake check. Right - so 10 mins ago none of that is done. Sorry actually what did get done is that you told me the brake work would cost $500. (1/2)

2995 2018-10-06 17:13:55 All these people talking about her kids. I think most of them probably need to look at their family trees.

2996 2018-10-06 17:13:51 Mostly true....but accept that they did something to get to where they are now that the far-east ppl didn't....without oil , where wld these guys be anyway !!
2997 2018-10-06 17:13:48 Dear FM, you never wrote to us when oil was below 40. What were you doing then. Did your team not know that there can be challenges. How prepared today for oil  rising further. Is there one agency in India which is responsible for managing the impact on  economy of crude prices.
2998 2018-10-06 17:13:44 Needless to say, Norway has become the world's second largest oil supplier.

3030 2018-10-06 17:10:26 Really, Norway has a strange conduct (it is first oil productor in EU) because norwegian government gives concessions to oil companies to drill norwegian arctic sea.
3031 2018-10-06 17:10:24 Why do you think he’s so keen on cooking with coconut oil
3032 2018-10-06 17:10:20 feel like I’ve really dodged a bullet by knowing I’ll never have to pay for a Bugatti oil change.
3033 2018-10-06 17:10:19 There's a market for this, for sure. It probably would not be that hard to construct (oil/gas, private prisons, weapon manufacturers, logging companies).

Russia: didnt see fracking coming and developed whole economy around oil. Putin on record in past saying oil would never drop below $80.

China: economic policies resulted in “gifting” of trillions $ to Americans
3036 2018-10-06 17:10:05 Endless oil story
3037 2018-10-06 17:10:00 Sounds like a home game for oil
3038 2018-10-06 17:09:51 You are talking about industries, not innovation there. And the exampled you have used are very government centric. Do you understand the history of oil production in most of the world? Norway for example. All those industries depend on governments too lol.
3039 2018-10-06 17:09:50 very, very fine slice, all spice, cayenne pepper, salt, toss the lot in oil. Spread on a tray. 4-5 mins in very hot oven. £4.50 worth of Chinese "Seaweed". Delicious.
3040 2018-10-06 17:09:47 SA is believed to have overstated its oil reserves. Also tried to control the oil market in a ruinous price war. Its cash reserves and income are falling, deficit rising and it has introduced VAT in the past year for first time ever. In short, its rulers have wasted its wealth.

3046 2018-10-06 17:09:22 when lysol had a tell tale scent, which I liked probably why I can't detect essential oils, I don't know if anyone is supposed to be able to smell essential oil, unless i put my nose close to the bottle, irritate my nostrils, sinuses. anyway my lysol began to spray in my luggage

3053 2018-10-06 17:08:56 Great read, well-done for making the effort. Have you looked at how other sectors gather data on HF, like @CHIRP_Aviation @CHIRP_Maritime @CIRAS_UK as well as the nuclear industry? Competence Assurance Programmes are commonplace in the oil industry too.

3069 2018-10-06 17:08:00 Now that everyone has told you that the Oil revenue goes straight to Westminster, along with all the tax from petrol sold at the pumps, you *have* to re-evaluate your position. This is significant information for you to absorb, surely. Does it make any difference to your mindset?

3076 2018-10-06 17:06:50 @loladeskentele Hi. Honor for me to write to you from Beijing. May I inquire if you know people in Nigeria who can supply crude oil ? Look forward to hearing from you. Regards. Wang
3077 2018-10-06 17:06:49 Man United will soon discover oil. The way you people are going down errr
3078 2018-10-06 17:06:42 @matthewjdowd blessed are the peacemakers...just kidding ....get em matt, Kirsten ....we all know the truth ...rep are putting a known serial rapist on the court because they hate women and love oil companies.
3079 2018-10-06 17:06:40    Crude oil s3n?
3080 2018-10-06 17:06:34 Sad truth is that Zim is in a mess and unfortunately it's the citizens that feel the heat. The responsible authorities shld take charge of the situation. So much precious time lost waiting in fuel queues; bank queues; soon it will be bread queues; cooking oil queues; etc.
3081 2018-10-06 17:06:27 I'm getting an oil change and I'm bored lol
3082 2018-10-06 17:06:27 Alberta has the 3rd largest deposit of oil . The world is hungry for oil .
3083 2018-10-06 17:06:12 May Allah grant her recovery!
3084 2018-10-06 17:06:05 Ok.. so short people should make themselves average? Is that it ?
3085 2018-10-06 17:06:02 I hope to God my wife forgets everything she saw but somehow I'm afraid the cat's out of the bag and now she has all these fucked up ideas about 皇道派 and the cause of the oil embargo and "if we didn't start a war it woulda been just like losing a war"
3086 2018-10-06 17:06:00 The capitalist billionaire siphon off the world's oil into their tankers, while millions have to burn manure for heat.
3087 2018-10-06 17:05:47 100%, bjp will be thrown out in 2019... Petrol price 85rs and bjp dreaming of 2019 win? There is a huge anti-Namo wave in rural India because of increase in petrol price...many in rural India (who really votes) don't know what is crude oil... Why increase in petrol price..
3088 2018-10-06 17:05:38 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund, until recently it had the publisher of the National Enquirer on it's board, it has a mandate to support the oil companies and is actively working to introduce US style conservatism to Canada.

3094 2018-10-06 17:04:55 Lmfao I asked this old man in Boerne "Where can a girl get a mf oil change around here" and he looked at me as goofy as a bitch
3095 2018-10-06 17:04:52 The lost 7 decades has a lot to answer. They needed Modiji to come in & focus on alternate energy sources? We keep on sharply increasing crude import and then subsidizing them at the cost of development projects.

Modi govt is on track in this, but need time to reduce oil import.

3103 2018-10-06 17:04:04 I need some oil. My scalp is ashy
3104 2018-10-06 17:04:04 Aku dulu suka pake olive oil untuk masker rambut selama sejam sebelum keramas. Setelah sebulanan jadi agak tebal rambutnya.
3105 2018-10-06 17:04:02 sanji doesn’t use oil when he cooks he uses grease from his hair
3106 2018-10-06 17:03:57 What else have you been doing about it all along other than tweeting & doing television bytes? By the way when international crude oil cost had plummeted fuel prices in India were still going up which is why they have shot through the roof now. Can you please explain this?
3107 2018-10-06 17:03:51 my mom tried to get me up by saying she bought me a new essential oil 
3108 2018-10-06 17:03:49 kamu beli aja itu bio oil nya nanti ada cara pakainya, soalnya kalau aku jelasin ga bakal cukup 280 karakter. hehe maaf ya:)

3117 2018-10-06 17:03:14 Organised cartels are operating in all sectors. Growth and inflation are twin objectives of monetary policy. Construction real estate and housing are the key to 8% GDP. oil at 100 would see rupee at 80. Nothing can stop rupee fall except tested NRI bonds.
3118 2018-10-06 17:03:04 Trump is the absolute repudiation of patriotism.  To him it's a word he's co-opted to sell his snake oil to the masses.  A true patriot to their country's ideals would be aghast at the stolen valor Trump represents to that term.  Have a blessed day.

3127 2018-10-06 17:02:29 Preheat oven to 400 
Cut up the potatoes 
Dry them off, completely
Drizzle a lil olive oil 
Season and add herbs
Add a lil minced garlic 
Spread them out evenly
Throw them hoes in there for about 45 min & flip in between the time. 
Then boom. Roasted potatoes.
3128 2018-10-06 17:02:18 It's no wonder the oil and gas business empire of the Russian mafia state loved to have @FBI Chris Wray helping them write up their multi-billion $$$ contracts.

3140 2018-10-06 17:01:06 Eco Styler Olive Oil or the new one they just came out with. I can’t remember the name of it. I like the newer one because it doesn’t have as much of a hold as the original ones do so it’s good for twist outs

Q: The Spindletop oil field, the first field to produce oil in the Gulf Coast, set off a boom in what southeast Texas town in 1901?

3143 2018-10-06 17:00:59 For shiny hair, mix one egg with a olive oil and apply to your hair. Leave it on for 20-30 minutes then shower.

3161 2018-10-06 16:59:39 @SDFordSummitNJ Another 48 hours without any response from Salerno Dwayne Ford.  When their tech fails to tighten an oil filter properly shouldn't they take some responsibility or is it easier to just ignore the customer ?
3162 2018-10-06 16:59:34 Iya pake bioplacenton! Aku langganan kena knalpot pas kena kecil gak tau gimana dah ceritanya mepet mepet terus kena knalpot :( tapi alhamdulillah sekarang bekas knalpotnya udah ilang semua gara gara bioplacenton, kayaknya dulu pake bio oil juga deh kalau gak salah.

3165 2018-10-06 16:59:16 For the records, oil price under PMB is now $85.03 * N361 = N30,695. Under GEJ $85.03 * N150 = N12,754 or $110 * N150 = N16,500.
@MBuhari @ProfOsinbajo @APCNigeria @OfficialPDPNig Take note because the inflow now is much.
3166 2018-10-06 16:59:08 Tell that to the tens of thousands of unemployed people that depend on the oil patch directly and the thousands of indirect jobs that rely on the patch.
3167 2018-10-06 16:59:07 I want to say TY to @JoeManchinWV  for supporting BK. I am sure his side wud like to boil him in oil. I give him more credit than Collins, who was about to stab her party, as she has done much too often. Out of the park Homer by Manchin!

If I make you eat something that 20 years later kills you, shouldn't I be punished now ? That is the same concept as pollution.

Please prove me wrong.

3175 2018-10-06 16:58:04 If you've spent any time around Mexican cuisine, you've heard that the seeds are the spiciest part. In actuality, the oil in the membranes and near the stems is the spiciest part of the pepper.
3176 2018-10-06 16:58:00 There’s a broader problem too. The idea that excess fat exists because you’re tacky. That if ate pure and clean like some imagines ancestor in an olive oil commercial, weight maintenance would be natural.
3177 2018-10-06 16:58:00 It is Fact. Please Educate Yourself on Oil and Gas. Oil and Gas contributes Billions $ to the Colorado Economy. It provides lots of Tax money to the Counties for Services, Libraries, Education and Discretionary Funds. To Support a De Facto Drilling Ban is very divisive.

3195 2018-10-06 16:56:13 The secret, in my opinion, is that State mandate is the answer i.e. treat the severity of the impending crisis as you would a war. 

Governments, even in war, require private industry tho [Boeing built the B-17s not US Govt.] + need all the key players including oil&gas on board.

3201 2018-10-06 16:55:39 There's just one thing that I cannot understand

In 2014, AK Antony claimed - We r not able to even purchase a small Jet

In 2018, Modi ji re-paid even the Iran oil debt

Signed Rafale deal & S-400 SAM deal

So the question is
Where did all the money go during the UPA regime ??
3202 2018-10-06 16:55:39 You mean the platforms  in the ocean? Ownership: ExxonMobil Canada (33.125%), Chevron Canada Resources (26.875%), Suncor (20%), Canada Hibernia Holding Corporation (8.5%), Murphy Oil (6.5%) and StatoilHydro Canada Ltd (5%)

3206 2018-10-06 16:55:17 I made up a 'mock-chorizo' recipe (though doubtless completely unoriginal): simply marinated mushrooms in smoked paprika, garlic & olive oil, then pan-fried. Not chorizo, but not bad!

3208 2018-10-06 16:55:10 @razorockJoe I just bought the Razorock Hawk V2 which is a terrific razor.  Will using a shave oil, such as Shave Secret affect the finish or otherwise harm the razor?  Thanks.

3212 2018-10-06 16:55:02 Stable coins are not only pegged to $ stable coins are coins that are stable measured from another value asset perspective. Oil, gold, $, euro. 

God, you still don’t understand that we need to build bridges to get crypto implemented first before overtaking the worlds economy?
3213 2018-10-06 16:54:56 I’m concerned with making AMERICA great. If we do that, the world follows. I don’t believe in Global Warming, I support coal miners and drilling for oil in America. I hope Canada is successful but I could care less how you govern yourselves.

3221 2018-10-06 16:53:52 $GE stock had it's best week since 2009 because it is on a sugar high from new #CEO #Culp being appointed. Do the investors/traders understand a $GE turnaround is like trying to turnaround an oil tanker in a puddle? This is a company that has been mismanaging #capital for years
3222 2018-10-06 16:53:48 I need to get my oil changed but I don’t want to sit at least schwabs chasing my hellian around
3223 2018-10-06 16:53:46 Any issues or problems with the oil patch that affect "real" families all stem from successive conservative governments mismanaging the resource and the royalties. In particular, using the latter to keep taxes artificially low and not investing in the sovereign fund.

3225 2018-10-06 16:53:29 No trade agreement can fix the global price of oil or he structural changes in the oil industry (increasing automation, consolidation). However, we do have Keystone XL Phase IV going ahead and the government has put its force behind TMX.

3233 2018-10-06 16:52:49 You spend your time celebrating mediocre results as if having 0.8% of unemployment drop and paying an oil barrel twice the price was the best thing happening to you. You really sound pathetic sometimes..
3234 2018-10-06 16:52:37 Lol the wait on a scheduled oil change is bullshit
3235 2018-10-06 16:52:31 Dr. Jones! 
3236 2018-10-06 16:52:29 Then I seriously doubt our President will protect your Country . Good Luck . President Trump isn’t a wimp like the others you have dealt with ..US no longer needs your oil so we have no reason to protect you ..Now spend that money on building a Military

3253 2018-10-06 16:50:57 Oil and Gas companies as well as the local 1% refuse to pay their fair share in taxes.
3254 2018-10-06 16:50:57 That's what's confusing me tho. Theres like a stick that you just pull out and it tells you where your fluid level is for the oil and transmission
3255 2018-10-06 16:50:50 Front yard mowed yesterday evening, back yard mowed this morning (after cutting up a big branch that fell from our pecan tree sometime last night), and checked the tire pressure on both cars.

3258 2018-10-06 16:50:41 More over you have short memory, Because of oil inflation due to the cancellation of Iranian Deal, because of the cancellation of the TPP, because of the trade war and the loss of south/central American Market, America isn't the shadow of what it should be.

3260 2018-10-06 16:50:30 I hope you're right about the break ups. When the tell-all show is made will Collins admit her husband has ties to Russian oil interests?
3261 2018-10-06 16:50:23 Bukan. Kleveru itu face oil
3262 2018-10-06 16:50:20 But in this case,even the wife knows, but she's refused he gets a new wife.
3263 2018-10-06 16:50:12 I've already given you examples and your explanations don't address why domestic oil prices high when world price low and why they were frozen during the KA and Gujarat elections. That's not deregulation. FYI I know the history of deregulation so this is not adding anything.

Under Trump, there are attempts to quietly open marine sanctuaries and monuments to drilling.

3282 2018-10-06 16:48:12 When it was one oil tanker a day, @JustinTrudeau , @jimcarr_wpg & @Bill_Morneau were saying it was to make up for the $15B / year they thought we were losing out on by only selling to the US...and now you’re saying it’s twice that and it’s not even built? Nonsense! #StopKM

3286 2018-10-06 16:47:37 The way man Utd is going down am sure they've already discovered crude oil.

3290 2018-10-06 16:47:08 No, but he did had over regulatory reforms that let banks and oil companies unleash “anti-competitive” market pricing.
3291 2018-10-06 16:46:47 The way Man utd is going down, am sure they've already discovered crude oil.
3292 2018-10-06 16:46:46 So you seem to think oil is the only way Alberta can succeed. 

"Delusional" how?
3293 2018-10-06 16:46:36 No I didn't say the government buys oil. I said "Canada". And no, that graph doesn't show a complete picture of government interference, it shows royalties collected as a %, it says so right on the graph. For example, the Libs $4.5B disaster, interference, not a royalty.

3295 2018-10-06 16:46:23 Uhm, any pointer to these studies?. It's definitely clear that butter is OK and much better than margarine and any Light version, but I'm now aware of a clear Butter > Olive Oil for frying fact.
3296 2018-10-06 16:46:01 Well, at least we agree the over-reach of the Military Industrial Complex and its many tendrils in tech is probably the greatest threat to peace and prosperity.

I would add private oil interests that use the MIC to backstop their deals -- screwing people around creates enemies.

3300 2018-10-06 16:45:54 They oil and gas industry will suck every penny out of us before midterm. They will find a reason to raise the price and make billions more .  They are blood suckers. Big republican donors.

3303 2018-10-06 16:45:16 We had some great conservation programs and Federally protected lands until your husband took away over million sq miles and auctioned them off to oil and gas companies and implemented policies which are destroying our environment. #Hypocrite

I dont have time to promote it due to I need to work my other 4 jobs lol We could definitely make a lot of cash!
3312 2018-10-06 16:44:28 Fracking is just ridiculously backwards anyway. We have enough offshore oil to get us by until renewable technology allows for smooth supply at the required demands.

3321 2018-10-06 16:43:13 These kind of foolish remarks show how devoid of reality anti-Israel activists are. Oil reserves anyone?

Was he the one that created the fall in the price of oil?

“Wake up, loser! I booked us a CBD oil couple massage.”
3326 2018-10-06 16:42:57 There was really no other choice Clinton, was going to stop all the fracking (oil) here out west, I highly doubt the last administration had anything to do or even be close to the same economy but that’s my just my opinion, maybe it is trends didn’t see any for 8 years
3327 2018-10-06 16:42:56 Feel like shit today and I’m a little sad but for some reason I have all the energy in the world I could do like 5 oil changes and tire rotates in 30 minutes

3335 2018-10-06 16:41:36 in this instance, sen murkowski did the right thing. but she also supports the rape of her own land and people by big oil. she is not a saint and posing her as one is not truthful.

3346 2018-10-05 23:59:25 I would start by having our land checked for oil.  If there is, lease it out for that purpose.  If not, lease it out for haying, hunting, cattle, etc.
3347 2018-10-05 23:59:15 Guess that means he will have be a lobbyist for the oil Industry or banking.
3348 2018-10-05 23:59:10 High technology depends inevitably on oil, fossil fuels are limited and corrupt the atmosphere. To grow cells rather than animals is nature hating. Why would anybody eat oil rather than life?
3349 2018-10-05 23:59:08 Could this be the crypto currency Venezuela announced that was backed by oil? Backing a crypto to a commodity.. That seems to be the most practical direction for revitalizing (subverting) the community

3353 2018-10-05 23:58:11 The trade deficit rose 6.4%, soybean exports fell 28%, oil is $84 a barrel, wages are still flat, health care costs are skyrocketing and the prez has spent 147 days golfing at his own clubs yet it's cost us $79 million.
3354 2018-10-05 23:58:10 Oil prices are beyond our control but if we REQUIRE 4Ps recipients to plant their own sili and other veggies in pots for their own consumption then d demand will lessen.Prices go down.

3382 2018-10-05 23:56:32 I agree we need to build Trans-Mountain & Energy East. Gateway would have been a disaster and Keystone only facilitates the sales of Canadian oil at a $40 discount. By the way, Harper got nothing built.
3383 2018-10-05 23:56:25 I did read all the articles about it which is why I’m asking, the oil deal fell down, it never happened. 

Siyabonga never had a successful deal with PIC.

Later on, his partner got money from PIC but nothing proves that Siyabonga was part of that. 

DZ deals did happen.
3384 2018-10-05 23:56:25 It did turn out pretty good, I have been trying things in coconut oil instead of canola or olive. I rather enjoy it! 
3385 2018-10-05 23:56:16 Here’s my take on the Kavanaugh confirmation process:
No matter how “foxtrot uniformed” America is getting; Our Great Nation does not digest snake oil salesmen well. That should be a warning to ALL politicians.
@sean_spoonts @BonnieBlueTK @clluelo @Sieve70 @_txgal @TuckerCarlson
3386 2018-10-05 23:56:05 They helped, that much is very clear, but Dearlove is lying about the when, the how and especially the why. Lots of corrupt predominantly Jewish bankers and oil people were brought down not long after Putin got in. Ask yourself why that would have been important to the west.

3394 2018-10-05 23:54:38 a few months before I left massachusetts I started using CBD oil and was thrilled to finally find something that worked for me. a couple of days ago I went to reorder it...and found out that it was recently made illegal in ohio. 
3395 2018-10-05 23:54:34 Family is traveling without me the next few days, so it’s time to revert to my grad student schedule and burn the midnight oil to finish: one book review, one NSF review and prepare 3 hour long lectures for systematics #whatworklifebalance
3396 2018-10-05 23:54:14 That study uses annual estimates. But realistically. Let's say half of at least once a week users order at store or online. 1 million people.

3400 2018-10-05 23:53:37 But it depends on liquid. Water has 1 gram in one milliliter; oil has 0,8 gram in one milliliter.
3401 2018-10-05 23:53:14 Some cables have a rubber grommets near cable ends. One has a split cable exposed to dirt near the crank which needs oil on the plastic guide now and then. The Bontrager rear fenders are cut too narrow where it bolts on. I add a piece of plastic to widen it to keep dirt out.

I often disagree with her.  But, in this case, she's doing the right thing for the USA.

Now, keep your mitts off of my vaping hardware and software.

But they are regularly mended.
3487 2018-10-05 23:39:49 My setting spray somehow turned into oil and now my face is oily and slipping off WTFFF

3489 2018-10-05 23:39:30 Yes and opened #Anwar for oil drilling. Murkowski can’t be an Alaskan?
3490 2018-10-05 23:39:28 Ridiculous. We spend far more on oil and gas subsidies- and climate change is causing the conflict and climate change that are forcing refugees out of their countries. Take responsibility.
3491 2018-10-05 23:39:15 1/2 Oil gives us quality of life right now, not some vague promise that it would do in some ever delayed future which never materializes, nobody attacked @tesla as long as they kept producing expensive golf karts for people insulated in their bubble of wealth,
3492 2018-10-05 23:39:05 No on both Rice’s. Rather, no, on anyone with an oil pipeline named after them!!

3494 2018-10-05 23:39:04 And like an oil tanker it has to squeeze into Burrard Inlet at 4:30 AM with the tide, because it’s too big to squeeze safely under the Lion’s Gate Bridge. But unlike an oil tanker it doesn’t have to squeeze under the 2nd Narrows...and there’s the 650 000 barrels of flammable oil.
3495 2018-10-05 23:38:54 The United States has some of the most beautiful and majestic parks and natural wilderness in the world. I shudder whenever i hear talk of oil drilling or taking the protections away from those places. One day I hope to visit as many as I can. 
3496 2018-10-05 23:38:51 Continuously. A framed oil painting from that cruise is hanging in one of my downstairs bathrooms.

3503 2018-10-05 23:37:43 You’re measuring pollution via CO2 levels. I’m measuring pollution via how often oil is showing up where it’s not supposed to be. In the latter, Canada leads all major oil-producing nations.

3526 2018-10-05 23:32:14 Can you show where we’ve been exporting to any significant degree to give weight to your request to be shown a spill? There’ve been countless bunker spills, in August a tug capsized off Deering Island in calm waters. There no good reason to ship oil to Asia, only reasons against.
3527 2018-10-05 23:31:43 $HOD - it's a 2X US WTI Bear ETF.  I don't like holding leveraged ETFs over a weekend but I don't think much will change for oil over Thanksgiving. Chart looks bearish to me short-term.  It could also be working it's way to printing a full bull flag so I have a tight stop.
3528 2018-10-05 23:31:23 I think you'll find world oil prices are largely unaffected by any change in our provincial government.
3529 2018-10-05 23:31:19 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, or the open border policies of this Administration.

3536 2018-10-05 23:29:44 Funny Joe doesn't see himself in the mirror. He should take a good long look and see he is just as bad as Trump. Regime change for oil while backing terrorists make him a tyrant and thug as well. Syria and Yemen

3538 2018-10-05 23:29:35 So to cut fuel prices @arunjaitley rolled back a major major reform of free oil pricing. All it would have taken to stick to principle was to take Rs 1 additional excise duty cut. Waah @narendramodi Ji waah
3539 2018-10-05 23:29:31 Nonsense. Govts had plenty of warning about Hitler's rise and did nothing! Let's face it the Establishment were making too much money doing business with Hitler both before & during WW2. War is for warmongers and of course pursuit of money & oil.
3540 2018-10-05 23:29:20 I don't see the problem... I thought we were fracking to have more oil for us, right? So this should eliminate some fracking, and save some water tables, right? Right? Right?

Realistically, yeah gas prices will probably go up so oil tycoons can keep their $ stream up...

3542 2018-10-05 23:28:38 I actually LIKE apple cider vinegar.  If you dilute vinegar with water and add a bit of sweetener and pour over ice, it's great.  You can use the same recipe for salad dressing but just add a bit of oil.

3561 2018-10-05 23:26:22 is it weird to feel annoyed at celebrities endorsing obscure companies like how zooey deschanel is supporting “knowing where your olive oil is coming from”. like people are LITERALLY DYING out in the world for so many reasons. they could be using their platform for so much more.

3565 2018-10-05 23:25:26 This is what happens when a leader doesn’t care about the overall health of the country, instead is more worried about gender. There isn’t going to be any oil anything at this rate.
3566 2018-10-05 23:25:05 How exciting! The rest of the world is leading the way on this renewable source of energy while we still plod along on coal and oil.

3570 2018-10-05 23:24:43 Bullshit. Gas prices still going up. Just more money for big oil corporations. Just like dofo wants as they finance his vote buying schemes.
3571 2018-10-05 23:24:37 it seems sensible it would affect bad idle, soot, misfire etc but not sure about richness. easy explanation for the correction between cold to hot. the oil loss shouldn't be too dramatic until they're further worn
3572 2018-10-05 23:24:35 The commissioned review into the operations of the state-owned oil refinery Petrojam has begun. The 10-member Commission began its work in September.
3573 2018-10-05 23:24:32 Anybody know anything about CBD oil ?
3574 2018-10-05 23:24:28 Truth indeed rather alleviates than hurts, and will always bear up against falsehood, as oil does above water.
3575 2018-10-05 23:24:27 So much for been in 2018 and equal opportunities thing is who did they actually support 11 years ago before oil money

3577 2018-10-05 23:24:08 Perhaps if you’d have known what type of oil you needed before you went and got it, rather than expecting someone else to know may have helped? But then again, you wouldn’t have been able to make a little video of yourself! Try looking in the vehicle hand book?

3579 2018-10-05 23:23:11 But gaskiya, Shehu Sanni is a disgrace. He dined with outsiders and denied his State a loan just because he has problem with the Governor. That's stupidity taken too far.

3587 2018-10-05 23:21:06 I used to answer the phone at a library, and one time someone called and asked what oil they used in porn to make everything so slippery. After some furtive googling I found a porn message board that suggested it was probably baby oil.

3589 2018-10-05 23:20:45 Yes, certain kinds of fungus can turn crude oil into a single shortcoming within oneself is more deeply true:
3590 2018-10-05 23:20:38 Tatarka's threat is that she is unapologetically minority under a regime that stifles all vestiges of ethnic authonomy.

She's probably done more to shoot modern Tatar culture into the national spotlight than all Minnikhanov's oil money ever could.
3591 2018-10-05 23:20:36 get the face mask I put on snap chat it’s at cvs and get some tea tree oil

3593 2018-10-05 23:19:41 I found something more annoying on radio than the oil/gas ads from the Colorado station and it's this ad on Milwaukee radio where a healthcare company pretends to care about people as human beings
3594 2018-10-05 23:19:41 Hmm
I do like Retsina which contains pine resin but pine oil?? Surely it smells like toilet cleaner

3599 2018-10-05 23:19:18 A barrel of oil has also gone from $30’s to $80’s the last couple years.  Not inconsequential.  Yet Californians complain about an incremental gas tax for roads.

3625 2018-10-05 23:15:10 Oil can gradually build up on towels that you use to sit on or dry with when you do #abhyanga. Wash oily towels separately in hot water using your regular laundry detergent along with ½ cup of Arm & Hammer Super Washing Soda. If your towels are very oily, add a full cup.

OIL！
3634 2018-10-05 23:13:40 Tea tree oil helps sis  same thing happened to me.
3635 2018-10-05 23:13:35 i am on the opposite of a pleasant megabus. wish me luck. the driver is enraged, every seat is taken, the only smell is stale mcd's fryer oil, and I'll be here for five hours.
3636 2018-10-05 23:13:30 Even coconut oil?
3637 2018-10-05 23:13:22 Back then thencocpnut oil was really bad.. Did I care? No.. instead I told her:,I’m so going to use use n we will see.. If a I die then let everyone know the reason why? 3 months later, I went back to my GP for another test.. He was surprised..
3638 2018-10-05 23:13:07 Musk is a fraud. Whatever happened to the liquid salt battery that was going to make solar and wind power feasible? Where is that factory of the future? Mars by 2019? Wake up and smell the snake oil.
3639 2018-10-05 23:13:02 Socialist countries like Finland & Sweden & Norway are pulling back on things like unfettered immigration, gaurenteed income and you have failed states like Venezuela with all its oil looking to sell itself to China for money and still the far left cookoos preach in North America

3641 2018-10-05 23:12:30 : Saudi ARAMCO is not only leader in World Oil & Gas production ; it is also world leader in use of digital systems & Networks.
3642 2018-10-05 23:12:06 I have a feeling making your own chilli oil was the easier option 
3643 2018-10-05 23:11:44 Looks delicious! Will have to try for sure!
3644 2018-10-05 23:11:36 I will also advise, if you re into investing in stocks, to buy the stocks of Oil Marketing Companies when they go down. A lot of stupid things go on in the stock market. As long as u find it tough to get a repairs guy, or a house painter, know for sure the economy is doing fine.
3645 2018-10-05 23:11:35 Sorry no oil for me
3646 2018-10-05 23:11:33 they always go away with tea tree oil don’t worry you’ll be fine
3647 2018-10-05 23:11:24 I buy that as well but if you have the opportunity to buy the Greek or Italian olive oil, I think you would enjoy either one.
3648 2018-10-05 23:11:13 They look wonderful, I hope you have a good harvest. Are they for oil or to be eaten ?

Be near the oil
3650 2018-10-05 23:11:09 It will be in FII [The Future Investment Initiative conference] and it’s far away from oil. This deal is just what’s happening in Saudi Arabia – so there is one deal in FII and there are other deals that will be announced there.”

3659 2018-10-05 23:10:40 Based on that then he’s a perfect candidate to sit amongst our country’s leadership. Why have an honest person of integrity in the mix? It’d be like oil and water. @stuartrobertmp is a criminal!

3662 2018-10-05 23:10:15 えるしっているか、遠藤氏は油しか飲まない。
3663 2018-10-05 23:10:10 Can I just mention that oil companies are now reaping the profits of $80 a barrel and are considering going to improved rotas for their workers. Aberdeen is oil rich again and we have 20 food banks. Outrageous.
3664 2018-10-05 23:10:09 Tunisia is the world's second largest producer of olive oil, after Spain.
3665 2018-10-05 23:10:06 I hope they play well. The Oil Bowl is tonight, but I’m not so sure our boys are going to do well against the other team.
3666 2018-10-05 23:10:00 Not a parody, just a snake oil seller shilling an anti-vax book.

I do worry about the willfully ignorant people who buy this stuff though.
3667 2018-10-05 23:09:56 You didn't know which viscosity oil, nor makeup of it You required! Not sexist in the slightest... You are equally terrible a person as you are a journalist...

3669 2018-10-05 23:09:46 Now that depends on where in the state you live cause if for example you live in the eastern area that isn't an accurate account of wages. Don't be blinded by the artificial pay needed in areas affected by the oil industry.

3677 2018-10-05 23:08:24 I’ve worked in the patch for over 25 years. Peak oil has been the next year for 25 of them, lol. Almost like people underestimate people’s ingenuity.

3679 2018-10-05 23:07:49 There was no reason for her to go on TV and sell her snake oil. All she had to do was vote yes tomorrow like she did today & just shut up about it because we already know what she’s all about. She’s never been a swing vote.
3680 2018-10-05 23:07:49 Figures look solid. Also: "Iran’s exports are barely down since August" and US exports ↑↑ to boot.
With most other producers either with no change or slight increases, the QUESTION is: What then is driving oil prices UP?? like >80$/bbl
Another case of 'market sentiment'??

3701 2018-10-05 23:04:37 One day, Justine. I generally lightly fry kale in olive oil or boil it.
3702 2018-10-05 23:04:26 It's vital even oily skin gets moisture because, without it, the skin will overcompensate for the loss of hydration (with more oil), leading to breakouts and an uneven skin texture. Take note: Moisturizing adds water to the skin, not oil.

3712 2018-10-05 23:03:32 #BelieveAllWomen or we'll scream at you has train wrecked the #MeToo movement, turned into an unfortunate parody of itself. 'Believe All' is not a smart way to start any serious movement. Even a snake oil salesman wouldn't go that route.
3713 2018-10-05 23:03:30 You better sray it with some oil sheen or something

3734 2018-10-05 22:59:59 There are two things about the oil price about which you can be certain. It will go up when `everyone' thinks it won't & it will go down when `everyone' thinks it won't. The one thing that you can't rely on is that it will stay high for ever.

3740 2018-10-05 22:58:31 Whilst the oil money keeps flooding in the dysfunctional system keep functioning - as designed. When the spigot closes for the last time the system implodes - as designed. The strategy from the offset has been: squander the wealth, don’t use the wealth to invest in the future.

3755 2018-10-05 22:55:55 I’m off the tractor, went out at 3am. Now I’m about to oil the deck then go farming.
3756 2018-10-05 22:55:38 So I’m sitting here at the mechanics waiting for my oil change to be complete.
3757 2018-10-05 22:55:12 seems like the bores are too wide (piston rings worn?) when cold = oil getting in but quickly expand? no huge whup then

3761 2018-10-05 22:54:06 Weigh out two grams of olive oil and take off heat.
3762 2018-10-05 22:54:00 I just waited at the Krispy Kreme drive-thru b/c I saw the hot light was on. I get to the speaker, and he says they are having issues and asks if it’s OK if the glazed aren’t hot. Should I burn this bitch down with gasoline or do y’all think the oil in their fryers will suffice?
3763 2018-10-05 22:53:55 Hmm thanks gf I’ll look into it I’m looking for Vegan preferably and with no palm oil 
3764 2018-10-05 22:53:52 I’m a Salicylic Acid advocate. It kills bacteria and controls oil without causing dehydration (when used properly). If you decide to come off Benzoyl Peroxide do it gradually to prevent the pimple kraken
3765 2018-10-05 22:53:48 Mood: Coconut oil body massage, blunts & a fancy glass of wine.
3766 2018-10-05 22:53:46 I was brought up on Olive oil but I do use Avocado Oil along with MCT oil. I rarely use Canola or Vegetable oil.

3773 2018-10-05 22:52:16 SuperUs: What Namibia will do in future? Triggering an oil crisis. You read correctly. In science there is no “maybe”. Why? Because they have diamond mine, also oil.

3878 2018-10-05 22:37:11 This is so sad.  When my mum had breast cancer someone gave her the book sharks don’t get cancer and she then spent a fortune on shark oil tablets.  The cancer went to her brain.  She died.  Shark oil doesn’t cure cancer
3879 2018-10-05 22:37:06 Im sorry, but why was I tagged in this? I am genuinely confused.
3880 2018-10-05 22:36:57 So sad that you have a political system that needs to pay its way out of trouble. How can ordinary people compete with (for example) the oil companies?

Why not seek reform so that a maximum spend is applied to promoting a candidate? That way,big oil doesn’t outspend decent folk.

3891 2018-10-05 22:35:03 That’s irrational. You think in order to work towards using less oil, improving the planet’s ability to sustain life, and reducing the damage we do we should go straight back to pre-plastic days, and give up all that has come with the damage we’ve done? You’re mad.
3892 2018-10-05 22:34:51 It’s a remarkable turnaround for the area. At least the middle-eastern oil men now have a firm hold in Britain’s 2nd most powerful City .

3903 2018-10-05 22:33:32 I don’t mind being taxed. But so long as my money is going to be used to oil the suppresion machinery that does not accord me the right to vote and grant me other civil liberties I won’t pay a song. Nah 
3904 2018-10-05 22:33:27 While potus is telling OPEC to lower oil prices. At $80 a barrel they can make the money that they need to help with the war in the Middle East without ASKING US  OR committing more troops. Nobody wants to give them money or another drop of our  childrens blood!

3907 2018-10-05 22:33:07 @lisamurkowski  We wish President Trump would pull your Alaska Oil Deal. You deserve to loose it. You are clearly a RINO. We won’t forget your blatant betrayal. We watched & listened today & oh my Senator Kisa Murkowski’s response was the only Republican with all the Democrats.
3908 2018-10-05 22:33:06 The industry is an upswing currently. Oil prices are rising and nominations for Block Offer 2018 were the *highest of all time* in NZ. The job losses I’m talking about are directly related to the ban. Will you address my point about the permit dates?
3909 2018-10-05 22:32:58 Please fucking stop I’m not religious

3912 2018-10-05 22:32:09 After the latest drastic increase in oil price, it would be understandable for the KNPC to reconsider domestic gasoline prices.
3913 2018-10-05 22:32:08 Germany had no blue water navy, could not invade England, was already in a losing war with Russia, lack men and resources(oil especially) to fight UK or Rus long term much less US.
3914 2018-10-05 22:32:07 You seem to be an alien in Nigerian politics but maybe after this experience, your eyes will clear to the realities of politics!

3920 2018-10-05 22:31:08 Eco styling gel, anything shea moisturizer, keratin oil ( I think that’s the name) and some type of green top leave in conditioner
3921 2018-10-05 22:31:06 Fantastic to see real business leadership is happening! 

A shame that @pepsi @indofood display no leadership by honouring  “No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation” rules in their palm oil policy. 

Support @SumOfUs @POIUK_PalmOil to stop  unsustainable greed. #PalmOil
3922 2018-10-05 22:30:59 Alaskans own 273,094 shares of ROSNEFT OIL CO PJSC, worth $1,558,157. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in RUSSIA.
3923 2018-10-05 22:30:46 It was originally created to clean gears in the Texas Oil Fields. Then it was used as a torture device by the Pinkertons on union organizers. Finally orphanage directors fed it to their kids saying it was a treat. Thus all Dr. Pepper drinkers are descended from unwanted babies.
3924 2018-10-05 22:30:40 Why? “Truth” is guaranteed way to destabilise a country..... you’re dealing in dangerous truths.... lies oil the machinery of state.
3925 2018-10-05 22:30:35 Take a good look at this beautiful place or better yet try to hurry and go there.  Because the next time you see it all you will see is oil wells and dug up holes with pipes in them.  Shame on them #Trump @SecretaryZinke
3926 2018-10-05 22:30:20 Big facts. Like...I just told you to check the oil bitch. I didn’t call bout no fucking brakes. Lol. That’s why I stay with my hood mechanic lol

3928 2018-10-05 22:30:16 Fasted 13 hours prior to blood test, only drinking water - No coffee for 3 days prior to testing. As regards "leaks", he only eats what I prepare which is 10-20 grams carbs daily. He even stopped his beloved tomato-onion-avocado oil side salad. Still working to get Tri's down.
3929 2018-10-05 22:30:12 Fat isn’t bad at all; at least 25% of cals. U consume should derive from different fats, like olive oil, animals fats & flax oil.
3930 2018-10-05 22:30:11 Maybe you should pour boiling oil on him? Teach him a lesson

3931 2018-10-05 22:30:10 What ever you say Ding Dong.  Hopefully you go back to your job in California and sell snake oil.

3933 2018-10-05 22:29:56 Aceite de Menta piperita"peppermint oil" es mi salvador cuando llega un dolor de cabeza, una gota en la frente(lejos de los ojos) pero un toque en la sien, a los lados y un toque en el comienzo de tu cuello y verás  el rápido alivio mientras vas a un Doctor para sus causas
3934 2018-10-05 22:29:42 Fair enough, I can handle that. I'd recommend cooking plain just in the oil and then when you let it rest season and lemon and salt
3935 2018-10-05 22:29:23 Friday night consists of me getting my own car insurance and officially off of my parents, oil change and grocery shopping. Topping off with the new Mario Party with @Drubert88 #adulting #fridaynight
3936 2018-10-05 22:28:31 I feel like they’re snake oil salespeople but I’ve never used it lol
3937 2018-10-05 22:28:25 If the contestants could not see it. Since when do we tell bowlers where the oil and the shot is?
3938 2018-10-05 22:28:24 16 campaign ads on TV last night: 

Beto's: messages of inclusion, family, and collaboration. 

Cruz's: "Cruz is for the Texas oil & gas industry", followed by pics of Beto w/ backgrounds of gang members, violence, & out of context quotes.

GOP has indeed weaponized greed & fear.

3941 2018-10-05 22:27:42 The war has been contained..if not won.Non oil exports have risen.agric output up,imports reduced.. retail stats indicate we are still expending ( sadly not always prudently),reserves  increased,stolen billions recovered ( though corruption war has more facets)....

 قال ترامب للملك سلمان 
Without our protection, your rule will not last two weeks. 
الملك سلمان رد عليه .
Without our oil your dollar will not last two days #محمد_بن_سلمان_بن_عبدالعزيز
3948 2018-10-05 22:26:33 Right, if. That's the theory of the gold bugs who promote the idea that "petrodollar" is collapsing only propped up by "empire".

But the IF is false. The seller of the oil is not dumping the dollars--there is no other currency he would prefer to own.
3949 2018-10-05 22:26:27 Midnight Oil!

3950 2018-10-05 22:26:26 Bros, stop living in the past, inec will collect the names submitted to it by the party chairman in 3days.

Do you really think there's ever going to be primaries for zone 2?
3951 2018-10-05 22:26:22 Try CBD oil it really does work wonders. Get one that is from a reputable retailer like Pinnacle after a few doses you will definitely feel the difference. It’s perfectly legal so no need to worry about that. It’s also completely natural. Exercise is also a good stress reducer
3952 2018-10-05 22:26:18 Sooooo this guy just paid for my oil change & gave me 40$ to test drive one of the cars at my car dealership . Karma honey you have been good to me

3965 2018-10-05 22:24:16 Sprinkle a little salt in your pan if you're frying. This will prevent the oil from splattering.
3966 2018-10-05 22:24:06 Yeah, I used coconut oil after + soap for bathing during my first, I felt like it dried out my skin so my second I only used soap on the essential areas lol and coconut oil everywhere else bc it doesn’t just sit on the top layers of your skin, it will absorb deep into them
3967 2018-10-05 22:23:55 Hurray for even $200/barrel oil #ClimateChangeIsReal
3968 2018-10-05 22:23:54 Just recently got off the phone with the mechanic. They charge almost $500 just for the timing chain kit without the oil pump.

3974 2018-10-05 22:22:51 BS!!
The 2007 financial crisis was a result of the sub-prime loan market implosion, and all the associated house of cards derivatives.

The investment in shale oil/tar sands was a strategic investment to increase US oil independence.
3975 2018-10-05 22:22:45 I just bought sesame oil for the first time and changed my entire life
3976 2018-10-05 22:22:39 It probably works even better in conjunction with some of the snake oil he promotes.
3977 2018-10-05 22:22:34 Omg I've been waiting over an hour and a half for a 20 minute oil change. #whyyyyy
3978 2018-10-05 22:22:22 It's only the left that wishes ill will to others and the Democrat politicians are banking on those people.  That group of Americans are the Democrat suckers, buying every bottle of thier snake oil.  The Democrat politicians say, there's a Democrat sucker born everyday.
3979 2018-10-05 22:22:06 I gotta change the oil on my bike before we go to Indy. I don’t wanna do it 
3980 2018-10-05 22:22:05 If you prepare the pan, discarding the oven for a plate lined with a few leftover roasted potatoes cut each strip of oil
3981 2018-10-05 22:22:04 I remember this one time when I used to work at Target, my coworker comes into my line, and buys some extra virgin olive oil. Before putting the bottle down she looks at it, looks at me and then goes “yup just like me” and thats the story of how she came out to me
3982 2018-10-05 22:21:53 If I break your heart na oil spillage
3983 2018-10-05 22:21:31 Don’t wish for it please 
You could literally fry plantain and egg on my face on a daily basis with the amount of oil my face excretes 
3984 2018-10-05 22:21:15 I suppose the flour, oil, yeast and other ingredients will be free somehow.....l
3985 2018-10-05 22:21:09 @pepboysauto Hi guys, do you still have this “Schedule an appointment online for a 30 minute oil change”?
3986 2018-10-05 22:21:06 I tried defeating the stereotype that girls can’t work on cars by adding oil to my low-oil car and then ended up putting too much and now I have to bring it into the shop anyway #fml
3987 2018-10-05 22:21:05 Can we please reach the point where we stop calling the oil and gas industry the energy industry.
3988 2018-10-05 22:21:04 Oil Treatment feels so good 
3989 2018-10-05 22:21:01 You look amazing Lauren. Lots of baby oil?
3990 2018-10-05 22:20:48 “Frequent Kmart” they said. “Lots of single mums there” they said. So far I’ve bumped in to 4 unsuccessful Tinder matches without locking eyes with anyone! On the bright side, I won’t need to buy any more candles, cushions or baby oil for the rest of my life!
3991 2018-10-05 22:20:40 the GOP old guard dug in and fought-hopefully fortitude emboldens them to do this more often. Lindsay Graham has been a stalwart and a voice of justified outrage.
3992 2018-10-05 22:20:31 My endocrine doc prescribed a high weekly dose a few years ago, and it's a key part to the arsenal to build & support endocrine & mental health. So are topical magnesium oil, a healthy gut, healthy breathing patterns & sleep hygiene. If you want data or product info, DM me.

4008 2018-10-05 22:18:14 Coconut oil is garbage and doesn’t have the benefits you think, FYI. But the rest sans bell pepper I make often.

4017 2018-10-05 22:17:21 Classic conflict of interest. We can not expect politicians to lead on climate. The oil and gas industry is too big. Too many lobbyists with too much money. However, they will follow if we lead them.

4025 2018-10-05 22:17:04 @oreillyauto just charged me $7.49 extra than the advertised price of oil because I didnt need an oil filter. I literally paid more money than the oil filter costs because I said I had a filter at home. Then wouldn't re-ring it when I went back up. Not shopping there again.
4026 2018-10-05 22:16:58 Yikes. Cuticle oil will help.

4057 2018-10-05 22:13:20 Pathetic that we have to hold their hands through the process. They were elected for this very purpose.

4059 2018-10-05 22:13:06 I clean but with warm water, vinegar, lemon, olive oil and lavender. Can't stand store bought cleaning products, they are more irritating.
4060 2018-10-05 22:12:59 Have you tried lemon?! I know someone that used to use the essential oil in lemon scent for morning(all day) sickness!

4078 2018-10-05 22:10:49 Do u know that your tweet convinced  me to change my engine oil 3 hrs ago?  Thanks  
4079 2018-10-05 22:10:48 Two points:

1) ALL hummus is made with 5 ingredients. Garbanzos, tahini, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil

2) Your link is broken. FAIL!
4080 2018-10-05 22:10:39 Yes. Hanin Z is a wh@re !
Personally, I wish the Arabs were not voting but unfortunately they do... 
Now when I want to think about Stupids, I just think of the Arabs. With all their oil money they still ignorant, primitive and stuck deep on the 7th century.
4081 2018-10-05 22:10:33 We need 10 more of these, 4-5 nuke subs and at least 2 nuclear modern aircraft carriers. We will need at least 3 seaports in the far north. Let's bring in more immigrants we need to grow. Let's become strong. Let's sell some oil & start digging up the rich resources of the north.

4087 2018-10-05 22:10:02 @IndyFuel had to wait 40 mins for chicken tenders and fries. I was given free cheese that  was thinner than water and tasteless.  I was disappointed in my food too.  They did not taste fresh at all. I think they used left over oil from last year.
4088 2018-10-05 22:09:57 I think cuz I have a Prius - I can’t remember how much my old car was for oil changed but I remember once i got my Prius the price was more expensive ;(

4094 2018-10-05 22:09:33 Trump has and will continue to leave his stain on our democracy. The damage is seeping into every corner of our country like an oil spill. Left for us to be clean up for years to come. Vote those best suited to start that task. Vote out these complacent enablers.
4095 2018-10-05 22:09:10 I thought u did great also now that its legal in our state plz plz plz ms Collins get some full spectrum cannabis oil and start a dosage I swear to all that is holy it will help you're lil medical problem and perfectly legal and much safer than most meds
4096 2018-10-05 22:09:09 Coconut oil dries the face out
4097 2018-10-05 22:09:08 China  overall was $34.4 down from $36.83 prior - so perhaps that was oil - it may be on govt site but am out will check when back - @astros playing

That's how we role.
4099 2018-10-05 22:08:50 That’s what I meant. I swallow my fish oil pills whole so they never touch my taste buds. If I had to taste the oil, I could not take them. Yeeeech!
4100 2018-10-05 22:08:47 You must be exhausted today. I have prepared the aroma oil in your bed room for your relaxation. Have a good night.
4101 2018-10-05 22:08:29 But I wasn't joking about having never tried pot.  I never do anything illegal.  With my luck, the first time I did, I would get caught!  (Plus, I was raised in a preacher's home.)  Keep wanting to try cannabis oil for health issues, though.

4107 2018-10-05 22:07:54 Act now and get a free air freshener that smells like shit, thrown in with your oil change and extremely expensive additional repairs I will definitely find
4108 2018-10-05 22:07:45 A command economy is not interchangeable with socialism. For example Jimmy Carter set price controls for gasoline prices during the OPEC oil embargo in the 1980s. Does that mean America was socialist? Of course it doesn't.

4112 2018-10-05 22:07:07 I was about to treat myself this weekend till I remembered that my cars been asking me for an oil change for over a month now 
4113 2018-10-05 22:06:59 If they were helping you why move you off them? Makes no sense. I'm starting cbd oil too as a trial thing to see if it helps. My friend said it helps her anxiety so hoping it does the same for me
4114 2018-10-05 22:06:54 But the bulls don’t care about oil prices
4115 2018-10-05 22:06:49 Both of you should pay attention to your diet. Don't suddenly eat too much oil. The body can't load. Drink more sports drinks. Replenish electrolytes. Res

4123 2018-10-05 22:06:02 Uh Oh --> Oil prices have already risen to a level that has contributed to a slowdown in economic growth and oil consumption in the past. #OOTT
4124 2018-10-05 22:05:58 You can exfoliate your lips once a week by using sugar and olive oil.
4125 2018-10-05 22:05:38 President Bush. I'm surprised. When you wanted the oil in Beirut...you raised your voice to do it anyway they could. This is just money again. Sad day. Better not say anything...let the world go to hell in a hand basket under Trump
4126 2018-10-05 22:05:35 I think you should get one if you want to stop relying on oil.

4131 2018-10-05 22:05:03 Yeah. This could be a great scenario for a couple or most of the old fashioned brand... Oh you want the latest updates? Schedule an appointment one of our dealership location and they will install it via certified sdcard. Oh the cost... $1000 each visit of update and oil change..
4132 2018-10-05 22:04:58 Corbyn is a communist, socialism has been tried over 100 times, it doesn't work, everyone loses.
#venezuala Corbyns favourite the latest to fail despite oil.

4134 2018-10-05 22:04:30 Fuel prices're increasing substantially. That's caused by demand being greater than supply. Part of that's caused by Mr. Trump's abrogation of the Iran Agreement. Iranian oil is boycotted by America. This could be a trend of higher prices on many everyday items due to trade wars.
4135 2018-10-05 22:04:25 I sincerely hope so! Lula was behind Venezuela’s tragedy. He and the Castro brothers got together to trace the plan to dominate all of Latin America, starting with Venezuela to use the oil to finance their invasion Cuban style.
4136 2018-10-05 22:04:15 i need to stop messing with these oil field workers.. all they’re here to do is make money and go back home

4142 2018-10-05 22:03:46 I hate when the mechanic asks me questions about my car. Like I don’t know I’m just here to change my oil 
4143 2018-10-05 22:03:40 Look into Cannabis and "Rick Simpson oil" its has been linked to killing cancer cells but you have to live in a state where it is legal for medical cannabis use. Sending you good vibes #fuckcancer
4144 2018-10-05 22:03:33 I love that they think this because it means they continually underestimate how many of us there actually are.  No wonder they can never poll correctly.

never will I ever understand the power of essential oils
4151 2018-10-05 22:02:04 Talk about willful interfering in the affairs of another sovereign nation: How shamefully disgusting  of the Australian Gov to bug the East Timor cabinet during oil & gas negotiation AND then try to prosecute whistle-blowers and their lawyers in secret court hearings. Shame shame

4153 2018-10-05 22:01:55 Hey, @WhiteHouse , Another year that my job can't afford to give me a raise, but Health Care Cost went up 2%, and my Heating Oil is going up %10. What is @realDonaldTrump , @POTUS , and @vp doing to help real Americans?
4154 2018-10-05 22:01:48 Why do you want the government to subsidize heating oil companies and diaper manufacturers? Smh
4155 2018-10-05 22:01:42 @realDonaldTrump  No War in Venezuela! Leave them alone! Fuck the Oil Brigade!

4158 2018-10-05 22:01:21 Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the kingdom's main sovereign wealth fund (PIF) will surpass its target of increasing its assets to $600 billion by 2020, as part of a plan to reduce the economy's dependence on oil.
4159 2018-10-05 22:01:07 Okay roasted with oil to store room temp in a jar? Maybe I'm over thinking this (and they've never lasted in the past). But they're soo good and Nov 1 when all the pumpkins disappear it's really sad. Debating a weekend of pumpkin seed roasting. 
4160 2018-10-05 22:01:06 クレマキッドさんもう5年ぐらい会ってませんね、。
4161 2018-10-05 22:00:49 You could come to Texas make sure you have the mineral right they found  oil from Lufkin to the panhandle and from Houston to El Paso and the largest natural gas fields around Dallas and Fort Worth And oil up around Austin and old dime box Caldwell.

Paper masks you can get at rite aid.
4164 2018-10-05 22:00:34 Your welcome! 
Plus there's so many types of these products out now, that using an oil is only one of many products to use.  There are even candles, shampoo and conditioner etc. if you want to take it slow.
4165 2018-10-05 22:00:31 We are on the same side of this issue.  You have been lied to by the right so they can keep the rich oil companies rich...
4166 2018-10-05 22:00:28 If I’m Kirstjen Nielsen right now, I’m burning midnight oil tonight into tomorrow.
4167 2018-10-05 22:00:24 How can you say that? Dont you know, recently our govt has gifted 40,000 tonnes of wheat to Afghanistan. This shows; politically Afghanistan is more important for federal govt than Thar. And, humanity is only to provide Afghanis citizenship in pak.
4168 2018-10-05 22:00:21 腹減ったー休憩休憩ー！おめーも昼はしっかり食えよー！
4169 2018-10-05 22:00:18 nice I've reached a point were I'm making more oil then I'm spending grinding. hopefully I can keep this balance going.
4170 2018-10-05 22:00:16 Destiny’s Words!! Instead of being Spectacular, the enemy want to make you a Spectacle!! Don’t be a fool, Guard your Oil!! 
4171 2018-10-05 22:00:13 These arguments are embarrassing. You can lessen your carbon footprint without completely eradicating the use of Oil. Polluters should be taxed. Those funds should be put towards renewable energy. Canada could be a leader in the industry but you’d rather we live in the 1950s.

4174 2018-10-05 22:00:05 of course they are being shorted by "oil" interests. they use shorts as cover. Filing lawsuits in this game is no remedy for anything.
4175 2018-10-05 22:00:02 This @GOP govt will care about the people of DC when oil is discovered in their backyards. Until then, enjoy your status as a “strategic priority,” like our friends and family in Guam, Samoa, Puerto Rico, Marianas, etc etc.
4176 2018-10-05 21:59:59 It’s shocking. Don’t buy anything with palm oil and we can change what’s happening #peoplepower
4177 2018-10-05 21:59:59 Meh, we built them three pipelines in last 15 years. 

Its never enough for the crooked oil industry.
4178 2018-10-05 21:59:46 They will go natural and start buying and applying 30 types of cream and hair treatment and coconut oil.. this and that.. you don’t need that shit. Wash your hair well and use cuza hair cream 
4179 2018-10-05 21:59:25 Most common things for the top 6 clubs to be bantered over:

Man City - Oil money
Man Utd - Indian fans
Liverpool - Lack of a premier league title
Chelsea - Racism
Arsenal - Getting battered in the champions league (+ Wenger before he was fired)
Spurs - Lack of trophies
4180 2018-10-05 21:59:04 And then some ... & I like marmite! But then I love good French cheese & wine, pasta, good olive oil, salami ... and I’m an elitist!

4188 2018-10-05 21:58:22 Humanity has lost its values ​​and fear of God. It is more important to sell weapons and steal oil and natural gas.
4189 2018-10-05 21:58:20 Thanks @KingForTexas for continuing to support the Oil and Gas industry!

4192 2018-10-05 21:58:00 NM State Government is expected to have $1.4 billion in new revenues next year!. This means more money for schools , roads , and first responders  . Retweet if you’re glad New Mexico’s future is powered by oil and gas!
4193 2018-10-05 21:57:45 I think it’s better for fuel price to just go up to $2 but ichibatika or even cooking oil ikaita hayo $4.80 but zvichiwanika and chingwa choita hacho $1.50 but tichiwana panekutambura kwatakuita kuwana zvinhu uku..Kombi yongoenda hayo pa$1 from Warren Park to Twn..
4194 2018-10-05 21:57:36 It turns out adding a dressing with fat to your salad is actually better than choosing to not add any, or a low fat option instead. The fat helps with absorption of healthy plant-based carotenoids & the best choice is a #monounsaturated based type such as olive oil #NUTR546
4195 2018-10-05 21:57:32 3hrs waiting time for an oil change and tire rotation?

4208 2018-10-05 21:55:06 "This is #extremely not okay," the donut lady whispered. Flour drifted onto the salad her mother had plunked on the counter in front of her. "You take that rabbit food away before I throw it in the deep fry." She nodded to a vat of shimmering oil. 

"Next!" she hollered. #vss365
4209 2018-10-05 21:54:54 It’s still just oil, dude. Even if some people used that term, that doesn’t make it accurate.

4214 2018-10-05 21:53:14 Today's Jumat lecture was food for thought, talking bout how blessed our Nation is, but yet how wasteful/selfish/incompetent its leadership has been. Our prayers have been answered by the sheer amount of resources present in each state ,but the oil money fuels our leaders greed.

4236 2018-10-05 21:50:11 Norway is one of the world's most prosperous countries, and oil and gas production account for 20 percent of its economy. Other important sectors include hydropower, fish, forests, and minerals. State revenues from petroleum are saved in the world's largest sovereign wealth fund.

4246 2018-10-05 21:48:58 Not to mention that most excessively rich folk have made their fortunes wilfully polluting the planet. The chain of stock market success attached to the pharmaceutical, oil & chemical (not to mention government), industries would make for a dystopian horror film....

4271 2018-10-05 21:43:44 It is dangerous ground that they are treading. If that were the law (thankfully they are wrong) then people could be summarily dismissed upon untested allegations. I'm hoping that the Uni's change so that allegations absent charges are insufficient to warrant summary expulsion.
4272 2018-10-05 21:43:25 Big oil propaganda and easy to see thru. I will be voting YES
4273 2018-10-05 21:43:24 The dude who changed my boyfriend's oil today left his phone in his car. I can't make this up.

Who in Forte Oil is contesting and election?

4282 2018-10-05 21:42:17 So, Chevron put oil in the ground millions of years ago (I know the process is more complicated!), to find it in modern times and make a company profitable. Got it!
4283 2018-10-05 21:42:01 Guy at the oil change place complimented my car and the drive thru lady at Wendy's complimented my septum piercing. So, YEAH, it's been a good day.
4284 2018-10-05 21:41:48 Truth! Slanted Door has an olive oil cake that will change your life. (Or at least help you forget the badness for a minute.) It's fall/winter seasonal... so hopefully here for us now.
4285 2018-10-05 21:41:19 You need to check out the natural energy spray with CBD oil to wake up without caffeine.  Or better yet, sleep spray to get a good nights sleep

4287 2018-10-05 21:40:52 I love CBD oil. I use it to treat my sciatica and back/leg pain. I take one dropper full at bedtime and 3 drops as needed for pain.
4288 2018-10-05 21:40:48 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
4289 2018-10-05 21:40:48 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

4300 2018-10-05 21:39:50 What men can do, women can do better, so yeah!  I agree! They should start knocking nails in the house when needed and maybe soil their hands with changing the oil in the car!

4308 2018-10-05 21:38:24 @StephCourts I think it's cool when people just keep doing what they do out of love of the craft and then strike oil by accident, like Jed Clampett shooting at some food.
4309 2018-10-05 21:38:19 Even those on death row rationalize why they are there...so who would expect the snake oil salesfolk (take off on fisherfolk of Canadian fame) to be any different?
4310 2018-10-05 21:37:58 I havn't crunched the numbers but they would fall at about having to drink all Fonterra's milk everyday and 100% of the detectable glyphosate staying behind to equate to the exposure you would get from one bottle of canola oil.
4311 2018-10-05 21:37:56 Actually he has will continue to do so. 

I'd rather we buy no oil and start moving to a totally renewable economy. Won't happen until both right-wing parties (Libs/Cons) are ousted.

4348 2018-10-05 21:32:43 48.2 billion kms driven on NZ roads over 2017, a 6% increase over the previous year.
And no real ambition to remove reliance on oil.
Quite the opposite... hit with promotion of oil-dependent vehicles, aviation-dependent travel, all day long, via every media.
A social norm. #nzpol
4349 2018-10-05 21:32:39 All based and funded wars on Oil that we supposed have enough of on this continent. Cannot change my mind from the truth I saw.
4350 2018-10-05 21:32:33 Perfect! It should be memorialized in an oil painting!

I also "name" the country's accounts. Did you ask him if and when this "family masquerading as a country" would publish a full list of its accounts showing revenue from oil, what amounts dispersed where and ...

4358 2018-10-05 21:31:37 İ would like to announce one more time that there will be no kurdish state forever. And this is in your favour. Your reputation started to sink dramatically in our region since the 80’s. Exactly when they started For a kurdistan. A kurdistan will return to you as drugs not oil
4359 2018-10-05 21:31:36 They have the power of THE CHURCH behind them. Power wins. USA is the same. Pipeline on Indian land oil companies win. Police killings
4360 2018-10-05 21:31:26 I feel sorry for all the people who parted with so much time and money to be sold this snake oil.

Don’t be sad, quit watching MSM spend some time outdoors in fresh air (not rioting) just taking in the beauty of earth. It’s going to be okay! Okay? So smell the roses.
4369 2018-10-05 21:30:46 Mix 1 pound haiku roll with 1/3 cup unicorn tears. Add Olive Oil. Roast. Serve with a nice chianti.
4370 2018-10-05 21:30:32 I put 5 different types of oil in my hair and now the fragrance is making me feel kinda fucked 
4371 2018-10-05 21:30:31 I like to shave them, then sauté in olive oil, sea salt and white pepper. I also cut them in half toss add a small sliced red onion toss with olive oil s&p then roast in a 400 degree oven to the desired doneness. I check them at 20 minutes. Even my picky grandson eats them!
4372 2018-10-05 21:30:19 THIS IS WHY I CHANGE MY OWN FUCKING OIL, COS U TAKE IT ONE OTHER FUCKING PLACE AND THEY DONT PUT YOUR OIL FILTER IN CORRECTLY 
BRUH I LITERALLY COULDVE JUST FRIED MY ENGINE

4374 2018-10-05 21:30:03 Maybe this bio oil will be the magic secret 
4375 2018-10-05 21:29:59 Oh yeah him and Hatch are burning the midnight oil. Grassly has a watch and still remembers how to tell time and Hatch has to locate his glasses once in a while so he can read what they want him to say. He's been brain dead for years.
4376 2018-10-05 21:29:56 Lucky for me when I get an oil change I have a movie theater right next door and plan accordingly

lubricant. Can be used as an unscented massage oil or anti frizz hair product
4379 2018-10-05 21:29:18 Only in your eyes. Let’s do both. The oil is too valuable to just sit in the ground and no one is going to let that happen. We can use/sell oil and grow a green economy. It’s called Synergy. It doesn’t have to be just one or the other.
4380 2018-10-05 21:29:10 Red label that's the official drink of ritualists

4385 2018-10-05 21:27:59 I use sweet almond oil on my eyes! I don’t know if it’s helped them grow, but it’s a great eye makeup remover.
4386 2018-10-05 21:27:52 どもですー！！
4387 2018-10-05 21:27:50 This was actually a pitch at the Nuclear Innovation Bootcamp 2017.  The bunker oil used by the shipping industry worldwide has an emission output that can be compared to those of industrialized nations.
4388 2018-10-05 21:27:40 Buy the oil and filter and I’ll do your oil change loser
4389 2018-10-05 21:27:38 Seriously? This guy needs to check himself into the nearest old folks home. I'm the resistance! No need for payment. These people are bought and paid for - themselves - by their corporate masters in the oil industry. Shame on them!!!! Projecting!

4394 2018-10-05 21:26:30 Powerful people are rarely heald accountable for there action and they take care of one another. Who takes care of us GOP being fooled by Snake oil salemens and Dems are week with a bunch of talkers no fighters. This why im frustrated. Jury still out on Avenatti we pray.
4395 2018-10-05 21:26:28 I just use coconut milk (canned) which has the creaminess of a cream but with the nice oil.
4396 2018-10-05 21:26:27 Wild seeing friends from home praising Murkowski for voting against Kavenaugh today while forgetting she sold off parts of Alaska Federal Land for oil drilling in exchange for voting thru Trump's tax cuts for the rich
4397 2018-10-05 21:26:12 All that fracked gas is going to Suncor and gets burned next door at Xcel so you might want to rethink the unconditional support of unregulated oil and gas
4398 2018-10-05 21:26:07 Currency dollar & crude oil is weaponised against india. American regime serves the Saudi cartel
4399 2018-10-05 21:26:06 corazón, I thought it was entirely fresco painted with tempera on wet gesso. you might like this information from the internet: in order to paint The Last Supper, Leonardo used an oil/tempera mix and applied it to a dry wall.

4401 2018-10-05 21:26:01 Oil have a word with someone
4402 2018-10-05 21:25:55 Never let facts get in the way of a pathetic ideological rant and retort  far removed from the actual evidence. I am betting you work in the oil  industry and have been inculcated with the usual BS. I get it science is  not your forte.Pity.
4403 2018-10-05 21:25:48 Did you know the @AGLC is not allowing cannabis retailers to sell hemp seed oil soap, skin care, hemp textiles or any of hundreds of agricultural value added products. Bongs from China beat AB agri-value entrepreneurs in our own province because of our own government
4404 2018-10-05 21:25:46 I might hint a top tip here. Try a smidgen of garlic, in with your egg yolk, vinegar and oil emulsion. It just has that je ne sais quois?

4409 2018-10-05 21:25:04 Has anyone completed a study to determine if reducing oil production to match pipeline capacity would increase the oil prices to the point where total receipts exceed existing?
4410 2018-10-05 21:24:59 @BetoORourke voted for a $10/barrel tax on oil

i.e. 24¢/gal increase.

#BetoForTexas #TexasStrong @tedcruz
4411 2018-10-05 21:24:49 I’ve got more rage than Saudi Arabia has oil
4412 2018-10-05 21:24:47 Wages growth yes! BUT WITH the FED HIKING RATES too fast too many times = wipe out any paycheck gains from @realDonaldTrump Tax Cuts! Main St Workers, businesses, survived 8yrs Stagnation on the very credit the FED NOW hikes, adding higher Gas , oil  it's affects are negative
4413 2018-10-05 21:24:37 Why not report it in fluid ounces for even more impact?  This is 553 barrels of total fluid; comprised of 11 barrels of oil and 541 barrels of produced water.  By comparison, a single rail tank car holds 824 barrels (131,000L).  Pipelines are safe and necessary.
4414 2018-10-05 21:24:22 Y’all I just got my oil changed 2 weeks ago and I’m already almost at 3,000 miles so someone pray for my bank account and Ruby the car

4416 2018-10-05 21:24:15 This 9 year old just came in the store and bought a quart of oil... I’m so proud
4417 2018-10-05 21:23:58 When you look up at @SenatorCollins's oil painting, you will see a figure so delusional in her naivety that she convinced herself that the fox won't eat the chickens in the chicken coop.

4424 2018-10-05 21:23:04 Is that the usual price for an oil change?

1) “I am not a magician”
2) “It is cheaper to import fuel, than to refine locally”

He’s just happy awarding contracts and oil blocs (if baba go-slow allows).  The guy is a disappointment, like his principal.
4434 2018-10-05 21:22:33 So, are you employed by an oil company or another revenue loosing industry? Or are you just a nut?

4438 2018-10-05 21:21:58 Curly or wavy hair should use coconut oil as a conditioner because it protects new growth and adds shine.

4454 2018-10-05 21:19:42 "Where we go one we go all"? It's not a true statement.
I'm going to go home after work, should I expect ot see you there? No, of course not, it's nonsense. Let's keep it rational. Producing oil and gas isn't synonomous with polluting water. Let's be honest.
4455 2018-10-05 21:19:30 Susan Collins I think you need some cbd oil in your life

4462 2018-10-05 21:18:45 The Hunting Ground seems a little too ... green for me. Shouldn't the landscape be nothing but churned up mud and oil? Anyways looking forward to seeing this ... I absolutely adore the books #MortalEngines

4467 2018-10-05 21:18:11 My skin used to be an oil slick and now it’s drier than my shitty sense of humor and I have to use hydrating EVERYTHING.
4468 2018-10-05 21:18:09 Only problem is a lot of former oil patch isn't pan handling to the government for handouts. They have found a way to adapt and move on.

4479 2018-10-05 21:16:41 Russians are working with Saudi Arabia and the US to drive up the oil prices. Why are we buying Arms worth billions of dollars from Russia? I only see a big win for Russians here.
4480 2018-10-05 21:16:29 Pulled up to the lot just to get an oil change and I’m ready to trade this in and get something new 
4481 2018-10-05 21:15:32 OK, let's learn a word time. "Colloquialism" means a regional or cultural use of words that isn't universal. Oil, banana, pancakes... those are universal English words. Y'all and fixin' to are not universal.

4488 2018-10-05 21:14:47 Has China "declined" since 1949? The only period of "decline" in Russia since 1917 was the 1990s, when psychopath free marketeer Jeffrey Sachs was privatizing everything. Then Putin fixed it by putting state control over oil and gas.
4489 2018-10-05 21:14:43 (besides, no fast food burger is greater than the Burger Tyme Cajun Blaze. And since that whole chain got zapped into the phantom zone due to an oil rig accident, all of these arguments are moot anyway)
4490 2018-10-05 21:14:25 So happy you can tell the benefits from CBD oil!
4491 2018-10-05 21:13:44 according to the police report, one video depicted “the female rubbing oil on herself and the child. At one point, the female’s vagina and the child’s penis appear to be in contact with one another.”
(You should probably change the headline)
4492 2018-10-05 21:13:41 It cost me $80 to get an oil change....
4493 2018-10-05 21:13:19 I'll be online tonight for some chillin', some oil, a little pussy play. Under doctors orders for no orgasms, FML right? So let me tease both of us because not camming is killing me!! Should be on around 8 eastern time.
4494 2018-10-05 21:13:06 Is it where you do pretend science on dilbit in marine environments? Then pass it off as peer reviewed? 

Or is it a PR lab where you find ways to spin 'oil pipeline breaches into a river' news? 

Or perhaps a sea level rise research misinformation centre? 

Am I close?
4495 2018-10-05 21:13:00 ごま油。。。くっそ。
4496 2018-10-05 21:12:52 Palm oil is revolting, you’ll get no argument from me. Same with cashew picking in many cases and the use of migrant bees in Central Valley. I’m not uninformed.
4497 2018-10-05 21:12:43 Yeah but... gas prices in some states is worse, and not as low compared to ours unless they're in oil country like TX. I'll take my gas tax, tho, because our roads need repairing. #NoOnProp6
4498 2018-10-05 21:12:39 Yay for olbas oil......

Oil was $16 per barrel in 1999. 

This Buhari Media Centre blackmail no go work o .
4506 2018-10-05 21:11:22 Socialism turned Russia into an industrial superpower that could defeat Hitler and go into outer-space. Socialism made China the second largest economy on earth. Socialism worked well in Venezuela until the oil price drop of 2014. Your entire premise is based on a big lie.
4507 2018-10-05 21:10:45 Calling it now but Misnight Oil is probs gonna be my fave song off the Pretty Colora For Your Actions album cuz I've had the single on loop for days
4508 2018-10-05 21:10:36 I feel way too excited right now about getting an oil change and my tires rotated. Is this adulting?
4509 2018-10-05 21:10:35 Do you have a source for this?  I thought oil was carbon based, indicating that it is from organic matter?
4510 2018-10-05 21:10:20 ＢＢひでえよ…(泣
4511 2018-10-05 21:10:12 This lemongrass and eucalyptus essential oil mix has definitely become my favorite.
4512 2018-10-05 21:10:11 RT @LivingSafely: Cool #Whip this October? Its first three #ingredients are water, hydrogenated oil and High Fructose Corn Syrup!

In the mid battle, and a difficult truce
Of oil and water, candles and dark night,
Hillside and hollow
4519 2018-10-05 21:09:49 Me and you got plenty to do..i don't need boo pool oil Swimming in You 
4520 2018-10-05 21:09:26 The US/UK staged a coup for oil rights and installed the Shah who was alien to Iran but a Stooge of the Americans, you must be aware of the brutal crackdowns on protestors in the US, and the heinous crimes Israel carries out daily on the Palestinians.
4521 2018-10-05 21:09:16 And you have a handbook which advises you on your oil...... and where to put it!!!!
4522 2018-10-05 21:08:50 how do I quit my day job to learn how to carve marble and strictly do renaissance styled oil paintings
4523 2018-10-05 21:08:37 See me in private for prayers sister Nyamekye... Bring along your baby oil. Its very important that you bring it.
4524 2018-10-05 21:08:35 
4525 2018-10-05 21:07:59 I see a huge deficit, a global loss of credibility, the sabotaging of our NATO Alliance, realigning our identity as admirers of dictators, rising oil prices due to tariffs, separating families & caging children, and a failure to help the neediest poor, tired, and oppressed.
4526 2018-10-05 21:07:58 If you run out of brush cleanser and you need to give your tools a quick clean, simply wash with olive oil and rinse them out with hot water
4527 2018-10-05 21:07:50 Well done Adam! Har work pays off! Still not sure about chocolate and oil 
4528 2018-10-05 21:07:35 congratulations @narendramodi for standing up to the Master USA..and do the same with IRAN oil..its an insult to the country like india if we cannot make our own choice...to be superpower will never bend down..

4536 2018-10-05 21:06:53 Blood is an essential oil.
4537 2018-10-05 21:06:46 Good morning 
kepo pake face oil keknya mantul kalo liat pada review bagus
4538 2018-10-05 21:06:29 heyyy ur from Pensacola! Me tooooo. — no advice. Never got cracked nips. Coconut oil helps when sore though.
4539 2018-10-05 21:06:21 There are so many choices. Time travellers caught on film and in photos is one. Lusitania was sacrificed to draw US into WWI is another. That fossil free engines has existed for decades but the oil industry buries them. Only one is plausible though.
4540 2018-10-05 21:06:20 but if you are going for an Extreme Soft Rice, after rinsing it and before simmering it, it's okay to heat about a tablespoon of oil and fry the rice for about two minutes. then just dump the boiling water in the frying pot.
4541 2018-10-05 21:06:02 Yes because INC didn't have foresight to understand country where Wheat, Rice, Sugar can double triple in 5 years, Oil can not even turn double, what hypocrisy, convenient argument like this are short-lived and good for mud-slinging only
4542 2018-10-05 21:06:02 Apricot oil on my hair tonight aka my favourite
4543 2018-10-05 21:05:53 Even decrease by 75% on US oil imports and same increase for Iran
4544 2018-10-05 21:05:36 Haha. From those we know now millions. Even my father is running away with Cannabis oil. Almost 90 and finally turned around. lol.
4545 2018-10-05 21:05:29 Happy to help, Joe. We don't have photos available of the Rust-Oleum Watco Danish Oil colors, but we do have a catalog available! If you DM us with your mailing address, we can send one out to you.
4546 2018-10-05 21:05:28 #TeamElon 
It's not the tweets, it's the intentional sabotage from the oil industry.  Tell me, how does the SEC hold dual interest?  He is dubious in his affairs.  Elon transparent.
4547 2018-10-05 21:05:26 Palliser Ford Kenny and all other climate change deniers you are condemning your grand children to a life  in the new hell, brought to you bye Big Oil
4548 2018-10-05 21:05:19 Ye Gods. Heating oil up to 5330 per litre (plus vat). Rural farms will find this tough. A year ago it was 2670. Harsh realities. @vincecable @joswinson
4549 2018-10-05 21:05:10 ما انا عارفه والله
4550 2018-10-05 21:04:53 Who has an indoor garage that i could borrow? I need an oil change 
4551 2018-10-05 21:04:45 Oh good. I’ve missed PASTRY and SPICE while on holiday and all I’ve got to look forward to now is coconut oil and stupid flours 
4552 2018-10-05 21:04:39 @BarackObama took us to junk yard & found a car. @realDonaldTrump took car put a new engine, fresh paint job, new tires, & now that the car is running good, Democrats want the keys? They will never change the oil, will never put on new tires & will put low octane gas in. #TheFive
4553 2018-10-05 21:04:36 Wish I can meet someone like that and pour olive oil on top her head .she don't try
4554 2018-10-05 21:04:33 #TipOfTheDay : Fall is here! Which also means dry skin season is upon us. Add coconut oil to your evening skin routine for the extra moisture your skin needs! Rub in circular motions on face & neck and simply remove with your favorite cleanser.
4555 2018-10-05 21:04:33 $2 trillion oil company but you drive a Tesla smh!

4559 2018-10-05 21:03:50 Is this like the oil business they were in?
4560 2018-10-05 21:03:49 Yep! Crisco was developed to replace paraffin & whale oil in lamps. Kellogg's Corn Flakes were marketed as a libido suppressant.  I just love the history of advertising!
4561 2018-10-05 21:03:38 if they’re oil heaters it’ll go away in a day prolly

4567 2018-10-05 21:03:00 They're nobodies without the oil
4568 2018-10-05 21:02:54 His hill to do die on is keeping Harper's CO2 emissions targets and being in favor of every oil pipeline possible. Pretending that he isn't anti-environment is laughable.
4569 2018-10-05 21:02:52 Or the equivalent. They may splinter once the Dems vanish.
4570 2018-10-05 21:02:50 Pug is now snoring. It’s like being in bed with a loaf of bread that’s been left in the oven too long and that makes sounds like a light aircraft needing an oil change. So that’s good.
4571 2018-10-05 21:02:42 She asked for oil (like anyone asks for advice) and was met with a condescending reply.
4572 2018-10-05 21:02:16 Poor Merrick was the victim of the Biden rule!  You (Democrats) see when you declare a rule that tries to out maneuver the Republicans, it can come back and bite you in rear end! It’s also called Karma!

4576 2018-10-05 21:02:04 No, We had to take over the country for oil.

4582 2018-10-05 21:01:22 ah tbh it depends on how you like it! if it turned out super sticky, you might have not washed it enough before cooking! sometimes it's good to add a little oil while it's cooking if you really don't like the stickyness too!
4583 2018-10-05 21:01:14 All part of the plan. God knew oil would be needed to create chaos to overcome.

4589 2018-10-05 21:00:13 Eventually you'll learn to fear the smell of peppermint oil. If I'm ever in a normal place (like with fancy soaps and whatnot) and I smell it, I have a visceral reaction

I don't recall him using that title a couple of years ago.

I guess he thinks it adds credibility to the snake oil he tries to sell...  but strangely it didn't appear to be in economics - but 'political economy' - more politics than economics

4622 2018-10-05 20:56:30 How much oil from countries that care less about the environment and human rights than we do come via tankers could be replaced by our ethical product? You need to come up with some new lines, these are getting old. Have you figured out how to tax sunshine and wind yet?

4637 2018-10-05 20:54:36 Asin eh... Even changing of engine oil for motor, no reach that amount
4638 2018-10-05 20:54:32 blame the US for the trade sanctions on Iran oil and the oil cartels
4639 2018-10-05 20:53:59 The Chinese hit back at the US by cancelling oil import (2nd largest importer) from the US.
Oooouch!!
4640 2018-10-05 20:53:59 Venezuela was doing well until the oil price drop of 2014. Even Wall Street Journal admits this. I was there after the problems had already began, but it wasn't anywhere near as bad as the hype you read in the press here. CAPITALISM has made life hell in Haiti for decades.
4641 2018-10-05 20:53:47 also yeah hummus is boiled garbanzos deskinned, blended up with some oil

4648 2018-10-05 20:52:59 Well the contempt is mutual. But I’m still surprised you would act like Avenatti’s lie was worthy of anything besides mockery. You’re either embracing McCarthyism or falling for a snake oil salesman. Have a little pride.

4652 2018-10-05 20:52:22 I feel the same way about the Scottish Oil & gas industry.
I used to work in it.
My boss drove up from England in his Porche every so often.
Double jobbing, contracting work from us to the other one at low rates, 6 figure salary, collapsed the business and f*cked off darn sarf...
4653 2018-10-05 20:52:22 My brother is gonna kill me if I don’t hurry up and get my damn oil changed. Lmfao I need to want it for myself.
4654 2018-10-05 20:52:00 I wash my face with cetaphil every morning, use face masks like twice a week and whenever my skin is dry I use Rosehip oil. Dassit.
4655 2018-10-05 20:51:58 Not totally.  Quite a few of them have been on his side from the beginning, and wavered not a bit.  But I understand your point...

4668 2018-10-05 20:50:10 I came to get an oil change ~by myself~ and they asked me questions I didn’t know how to answer LOL 
4669 2018-10-05 20:50:01 So oil will get more expensive when most of the demand for it due to shifting energy sources disappears..? Sure, economies of scale are a thing, but supply chains can shift. The price of a product is not the same as a tax to alter its rate of use...
4670 2018-10-05 20:49:50 Why do you keep giving this snake oil salesman a platform?  He's a clown.
4671 2018-10-05 20:49:41 Watching Take Five Oil have trouble changing the oil in the Saturn Ion. Lol. So much for being the quickest oil change around.
4672 2018-10-05 20:49:36 We can convert plastic waste to fuel oil mix it with tar to lay new roads contact us #yestrashcan
4673 2018-10-05 20:49:14 I've been taking my vehicle to the same place for maintenance since the beginning, but they still ask things like "when were you last in?" and "Did you get your oil changed last time?" THIS IS WHY I GO TO THE SAME PLACE. So you keep these kinds of records and I don't have to.

4703 2018-10-05 20:46:32 Interesting thought exercise. Natural resources and farmland are much more prominent in red states. Fresh water, crops, oil, natural gas etc would all be in short supply for the blue states. The west and northeast coasts blue and gulf/SE coast and heartland red
4704 2018-10-05 20:46:29 2 parts gasoline mixed with 1 part oil and 1 part soap. You put it in a bottle, stick a Tampax into the neck, and tape it shut with the string sticking out. Before you throw it, light the string and then heave it so it’ll break upon contact. The molotov is the poor man’s napalm.
4705 2018-10-05 20:46:19 why do a shot of oil when you could actually just eat a slice?
4706 2018-10-05 20:46:16 Get over yourself go on Google and find what oil you need first it's not hard to do
4707 2018-10-05 20:46:10 For healthy shiny hair use a hot oil treatment once a week.

4712 2018-10-05 20:45:44 I have been to Liverpool multiple times Mr plastic, and also me saying you club began in 2008 is implying you were beyond irrelevant before that and only came to relevancy with oil money.
4713 2018-10-05 20:45:38 Same here. I honestly don’t dont do it enough. I picked up a sourdough mix from the coop for about 50p, you just add warm water and oil. It’s great to chuck in a bread maker too if you want to be extra lazy. X

4720 2018-10-05 20:44:47 it's an italian dish with mozzarella cheese, sliced tomatoes and basil all laced with some olive oil.
4721 2018-10-05 20:44:47 I'm liking the nuance of blending ...my exposure to the oils for the longest time was working in a spa where we would offer "Raindrop Therapy" which basically is every oil in the box massaged over the spine one at a time...and it's a cacophony lol. More is not always better :P
4722 2018-10-05 20:44:46 @TomiLahren Trump should reconsider that big oil deal he granted Alaska
4723 2018-10-05 20:44:43 For such road,  don't waste your money,  buy ori(sheer butter)  mix it with palm oil and grease. Thank me later

4725 2018-10-05 20:44:06 You look at those dying in Primary elections now and you understand the full meaning of President Jonathan's statement that

They die to oil people's ambition.

Only big oil has the ability to cover the planet in enough of a #hydrogen infrastructure to make it the clear mainstream choice.

4740 2018-10-05 20:42:27 In other words, neither buyer of oil nor seller of oil needs to hold the dollar, i.e. support the value of the dollar. Both can exchange with the currencies they really desired.

If they really desired to hold USD-derivative in preference to USD...
4741 2018-10-05 20:42:23 I wish I'd kept up my artistic streak, haven't done anything since school. I hope you'll put the oil version on here too.

4757 2018-10-05 20:40:17 I also use coconut oil in my hair after I wash it while damp. A dime size. And some people take coconut oil supplements as well.
Hope you find a good combo that works! Mine was from the stress of my divorce and it's much better now.

4768 2018-10-05 20:38:35 spotting is def a sign of too much oil, as you discovered. if the shine is diffuse, it might be fine...as long as your pan doesn't becomes sticky or tacky after a while, it's fine (stickiness is a sure sign the oil didn't polymerize enough)
4769 2018-10-05 20:38:27 Daily tip: instead of perfume use essential oil! It’s safer for the environment and shit smells danky waaaaay longer.

4783 2018-10-05 20:36:33 Well, the sole reason Trump was put in power was to act as a massive distraction while fossil fuel billionaires delay climate action and rake in profits for a few more years. There is no other reason. NRA, Russia, InfoWars, GOP leaders, behind it all is oil and gas money.
4784 2018-10-05 20:36:33 Going to try it with oil paint next time

Gold +.8%
4802 2018-10-05 20:32:46 Again. I'm not for subsidies of any kind. So we agree on something maybe! The question is how do you remove all of them in a fair manner given people have made large long term investment decisions around these subsidies (oil, green energy, etc)
4803 2018-10-05 20:32:45 Why u dey use red oil dey fry plantain.

4809 2018-10-05 20:32:04 @realDonaldTrump All the words I say are true and not mistaken. Your government has promise and should cut off Iran's oil exports to zero by November 4th. If this is not done, America's credit will be severely questioned. Exemption to China or India is a disaster for you
4810 2018-10-05 20:31:53 Oil tanker.
4811 2018-10-05 20:31:42 And as far as if it’s what’s actually happening -I will look forward for your support for a future democratic nomination if he angrily snarls that the gop senators voting against him are all puppets of a kremlin controlled gop, fueled by big oil and anger over a lost election

4814 2018-10-05 20:31:15 #Alberta mismanaged their oil wealth.  It was a failed right wing disaster.  They took their money and bought votes with tax cuts for decades.  They should realize their mistake and not vote for Kenny who has no plan for climate change or the new fiscal realities of the province.

You democrats are #DemocratDevils and #LiberalLunatics. Hillary got millions from Rosneft parent Co, Rosatom.
4846 2018-10-05 20:26:21 Wow, I was about to go vacuum my car out, but they doing it for me while changing my oil.
4847 2018-10-05 20:26:05 You haven't answered my question.  Have you ever tried one?  I recommend the chopped garlic that comes in a jar, packed in oil.  Fresh garlic is too strong for a peanut butter and garlic sandwich.
4848 2018-10-05 20:26:01 Wonderful, that you can eat this. If it is allowed, you can add toasted sesame oil.
4849 2018-10-05 20:25:36 Our CEO, Sam Thigpen, has arrived in sunny Santa Fe to attend the 90th Annual New Mexico Oil & Gas Association Meeting. Looking forward to seeing all our friends in attendance! #NMOGA2018
4850 2018-10-05 20:25:10 no, but the damage has happened now and the institutions that have confirmed it more or less in America and Syria have won.  Just need to clear out IDLIB now, get rid of the illegal oil drilling in the south east and return them back to a country again and fend off expansionism
4851 2018-10-05 20:25:08 I’m ready try wild growth oil, I heard it works
4852 2018-10-05 20:25:04 India had planned to import about 25 million tonnes of crude oil from Iran in the current fiscal but actual volumes imported will be far less since companies like Reliance Industries in India have stopped buying oil and others dcaling down to win sanctioms waiver from the US

4869 2018-10-05 20:22:44 @IndWorldThinker so nene undermined the country & said no but GAVE our money to his son to buy an oil company ?
4870 2018-10-05 20:22:20 I said not true that is why Tesla exists. The reason they need the subsidy is because oil subsidies exist. Eliminate all and Tesla would exist unsubsidized.
4871 2018-10-05 20:22:09 hearing so much about cbd oil lately but I’m not hip. someone send me somewhere I can find more info (I know I can google but there’s too much to decide where to start)

4882 2018-10-05 20:20:09 You can see where operator stood, operating a lathe. Stains of machine oil on the footing and floor.
4883 2018-10-05 20:20:07 when your car need an oil change, your boss doesn't pay you and you can't score anyplace where you get your money's worth in the same week
4884 2018-10-05 20:20:07 that is just my guess , but I mean Houston , has the oil business, so they can get the $$$ if you ask  me how a team can do it .. just depends on calls as well... idk
4885 2018-10-05 20:20:02 What's ocean and oil??
4886 2018-10-05 20:19:56 Period ! They always trying to make me get a new filter ! Last time i was here y’all changed it so no thank you ! Oil change ONLY
4887 2018-10-05 20:19:48 I wonder what snake oil @senatemajldr promised you @SenatorCollins ?? What’s your soul worth?  You’re a disgrace to the country & a disgrace to women everywhere. Those men used you, and you let them. All credibility LOST.
4888 2018-10-05 20:19:44 I’m not picking a fight just clarifying for you- natural gas is also a fossil fuel and is often found when exploring for oil. Also when natural gas is converted into NGL it is highly explosive.

4891 2018-10-05 20:19:30 My mom had a bmw and found maintenance quite expensive. For example, oil filters were like $100 a piece (or maybe she was just getting hosed). Lexus might be the same way, but since they’re an off shoot of Toyota, I would think cheaper to maintain. Second hand info though, so...?
4892 2018-10-05 20:19:26 Well she would care if she thought the Arctic oil operations ended Because of her vote
4893 2018-10-05 20:19:24 fun fact oil companies are evil so nothing matters anyways so who cares!

4900 2018-10-05 20:18:15 I deployed the hoover and tights solution the last few years. Works although it’s a daily job for a few weeks. Then use citronella candles/ oil to put them off coming back... I find them weirdly creepy...
4901 2018-10-05 20:18:06 Even thou President Trump stood up for #Alaska finally opening up ANWR for oil drilling. @lisamurkowski still says she is voting No on #JudgeKavanaugh 
I sure hope that @SarahPalinUSA runs AGAINST Murkowski in 2020 and finally stands up for American Values in Alaska.
4902 2018-10-05 20:18:00 I threw the extra out of a cooler and put more beer in. Does that count? Ann I would rub some ice on your feet if they hurt, and oil, and massage them with beer.

4908 2018-10-05 20:17:29 Not true. Oil heavily subsidized (giant pipelines take massive government influence). I would prefer removing all subsidies and Tesla would win more than they are.
4909 2018-10-05 20:17:00 Most Canadians natives want pipelines. I have a button blanket just like that. I danced and sang traditionally around the NW for 3 years. Don’t be fooled by pictures and the American NGOs that fund numerous protests and anti-energy activities. If water is sacred, then so is oil.

4923 2018-10-05 20:16:03 Except most of the world isnt near the Sahara and that's not how grids work. This is my point about having an honest discussion.

4924 2018-10-05 20:15:58 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
4925 2018-10-05 20:15:50 Why is it delusional to think an oil rich European country couldn't be like all other normal EU countries, rather than as bad as the UK, which has by far the worst pension, uni fees that are £9K compared to free most other places etc?

4928 2018-10-05 20:15:46 If you're wanting to try an actually good tasting CBD oil, ours tastes like oranges! 
4929 2018-10-05 20:15:44 @havingmyway_, And NO, But the idea entered in. That’s the point I want to get across to people. When one hang with people who go against God’s ways, you began to be influenced by darkness and what do light have with darkness? It’s like oil and water, IT DON’T MIX! COME OUT FROM!

4933 2018-10-05 20:15:20 my point in the video is CBs, institutions and everyone else hold dollars for reasons far beyond needing them to buy oil from Saudi Arabia
4934 2018-10-05 20:15:11 I would get intense muscle spasms from having general anxiety disorder months ago. I tried a CBD oil that I bought from Earth Bound Trading Co., I would then apply that to my area of pain and it really does wonders. As far as the physical part it helped.
4935 2018-10-05 20:14:57 Even with the current oil boom?

4956 2018-10-05 20:11:45 Just bought SO many essential oils. Hoping perhaps to make a warming massage oil and some sexy blends for diffusing and cozying up. Cinnamon? Clove? Black pepper? Yum. Anyone else going through a phase like this? Lol

4962 2018-10-05 20:10:27 A few weeks ago, we fixed our 60 year old toaster. It's a peach of a toaster. All it needed was a bit of oil on its dashpot. I love that word..dashpot. I received this toaster 20 years ago when my roommate set it aside. I'm sure she's gone through 8-10 toasters since.

4965 2018-10-05 20:10:11  olive oil 
it can be combined with other ingredients in a face mask to unclog pores, make hair shinier and reduce split ends, and strengthen nails. 

Olive oil can also be used as an on-the-go styling spray to make your hair appear less dry and dull.

4970 2018-10-05 20:09:59 That is absolutely right.  Things are so much better since the Federal tax relief the regulation removals.  Especially in an oil rich state like Texas.  People I know are making money and pulling out of the slump of the last decade.

But they've all been prescribed "cod liver oil" and it just feels like a big scam. Considering the company is paying $40 per bottle per employee
4988 2018-10-05 20:07:31 Yes, this is what I have been using, and in the past it has taken care of the problem, but tho it will kill those who show up, they just keep coming anyway! In the past they stopped coming once the peppermint was there. I'm going to try cedar oil. Maybe a combo.

4992 2018-10-05 20:06:53 I would be most interested in how a court would react to a lawsuit like that.  I wouldn't personally imply that they are using bug poison in a food product though, they well could just be using a lavendar essential oil that is naturally derived.

5001 2018-10-05 20:05:38 Are you kidding? We had the oil price hike and Barber boom to deal with. It took years of wage restraint from trade unionists to get the resulting rampant inflation down.
5002 2018-10-05 20:05:35 Once had a potential employer call me a gang rapist. He later apologized, saying “it’s just how we do business in the food service industry”. Anyway, I’m celebrity chef now.

5026 2018-10-05 20:02:44 Also: 1 spray bottle full of water, 1 oz. bottle peppermint oil, 1 drop dishwashing liquid. Dissolves the oil protecting exoskeleton breathers and drowns them, neurotoxic to most book lung breathers (like spiders). Easy, cheap, and I've watched it drop a wasp WHILE it attacked.

5036 2018-10-05 20:01:06 Truly shiny indicates to me that there's oil that still hasn't polymerized. It becomes much more matte once transformed into real seasoning. I'd buff even more, and make sure you're heating long enough to turn that shiny oil more dull.

5040 2018-10-05 20:00:39 It gets confusing though because it is ALSO something that sometimes is produced as industrial waste.   So it can be natural or unnatural.  Where it is a big problem is that the whole essential oil industry has shit regulations.

5066 2018-10-05 19:57:06 @dgritzer  Following your article on cast iron cleaning, I notice how little oil I use and heat and wipe, my pan still remains shiny.  Not glossy or thick, but does look like a very thin oil coat is on it.  I assume no issue unless I notice that it smells/looks off?
5067 2018-10-05 19:57:05 I don't think any anarchists proclaim their society will be perfect.....

Far from it.

They're not snake oil salesmen.
5068 2018-10-05 19:56:26 #India  defies #US . Deal for S 400 signed. Despite US sanctions India will continue to import crude oil from #Iran . Well done @narendramodi now we are waiting for @realDonaldTrump reaction

5072 2018-10-05 19:55:58 Starting to think that the Klubot needs a little oil here. #ALDS
5073 2018-10-05 19:55:54 I listened to twitter and now I’m getting an oil change... 
5074 2018-10-05 19:55:28 The oil in My Country Guyana  is drawing the crowd 
5075 2018-10-05 19:55:21 Chai. Too much Oil dey your head.
White rice, stew and tea on Sunday morning is Heavenly
5076 2018-10-05 19:55:09 When you’re doing your #abhyanga, it’s easy to get oil everywhere! To keep things contained, set aside a special towel to sit or stand on during your morning massage. Keep a few paper towels handy, so you can wipe off any excess oil before hopping in the shower.
5077 2018-10-05 19:54:58 Theres always that one guy that paces back and forth like somebody gonna fuck his 94 Chevy up with an oil change..
5078 2018-10-05 19:54:51 3 day week, uncollected rubbish for weeks , colossal  oil prices , etc ....The point is one cant go back to ANYTHING
5079 2018-10-05 19:54:49 Maybe Castor oil
5080 2018-10-05 19:54:49 Sometimes they’ve been trained to be a king ...but the oil is only going to flow 
on the head of 
God’s KING.
5081 2018-10-05 19:54:32 I know women being alone and scared all the time is a serious problem but can we talk about going to a mechanic alone. Scared for my entire bank account every time I need an oil change
5082 2018-10-05 19:54:18 Lorenzo’s Oil? Awakenings?

A damm fine ending for #ukog #angs and #frr this week.
I think November and December could feel like  an early Christmas for us..


5089 2018-10-05 19:53:49 Why do you think it's either or? Pretty sure water is threatened by geoengineering, mass use of pesticides like glyphosate ect. shutting down the oil and gas industry won't make your water cleaner, it will lower our standard of living no doubt.
5090 2018-10-05 19:53:42 I use a mix of 40% linseed oil and 60% pure turpentine (rec by @w_r_adams). On dark, hard limestone, Kilkenny, it soaks in, darkens and gives a sheen.
5091 2018-10-05 19:53:29 We have much higher standards and regulations here.
Just because one country has a problem does not mean another country does.
Lumping all oil and gas extraction practices together from all countries and not identifying the vast diffrences in policy is lazy and irresponsible.
5092 2018-10-05 19:53:29 Lorenzo’s Oil? Must say I think it’s a pretty awful film and no idea if it’s accurate, but it sprang to mind
5093 2018-10-05 19:53:08 compassion isn't an exclusive emotion, you can still have compassion for someone who is a gigantic, selfish, self-serving tool who sells out her pride and dignity for pats on the head and still hold anger at their actions. it might mix like oil and water, but it isn't impossible.
5094 2018-10-05 19:53:08 Getting my oil changed and brakes fixed this weekend. I deserve a reward for keeping up my car maintenance

5104 2018-10-05 19:52:08 I was listening to an oil expert on CNBC last week - stating that despite EV projections oil consumption/demand will not peak until after 2030
5105 2018-10-05 19:52:05 @SenatorCollins represents Maine, not Utah.  She may not be as conservative as we conservatives would like, but I honor her today. I’m glad we have her. That was a speech that any senator should have been proud to present.  She was masterful. #ConfirmKavanaghNow
5106 2018-10-05 19:51:58 **mother and daughter look up at oil painting**
MOTHER: That's her. That's Senator Susan Collins. She helped put a partisan entitled judge suspected of sexual assault on the Supreme Court.
5107 2018-10-05 19:51:38 They had a whole ass prisma color kit for $20????? And good oil paints for $0.75 each???? A fucking deal
5108 2018-10-05 19:51:32 I'm going get an oil change and car wash tomorrow. They bet not offer me nothing else!
5109 2018-10-05 19:51:29 She has forgotten what our POTUS did for the state of Alaska with the oil ?
5110 2018-10-05 19:51:21 If things keep getting worse re: anxiety, seek help from a doctor or therapist. But, tbh, medical marijuana is legal in Florida now. CBD oil has worked wonders for me, especially since I can’t use traditional medications to treat mine without dangerous side effects.
5111 2018-10-05 19:51:11 No they’ve a vested interest. Trumps a valuable asset. Trumps a traitor and the end game is to dismantle democracy from the inside out. Trumps a charlatan, con, snake oil salesmen with cohorts who drank the poisonous kool aid. Big picture. Don’t miss the forest for the trees.
5112 2018-10-05 19:51:01 The perception of tesla will change soon . Be patient, and a crash is on its way ... keep some cash to buy at 50-60% discounts, or god forbid 80-90% ! But Tesla is the future anyways... who will drive oil based cars,when electric is available.. the poor!
5113 2018-10-05 19:50:59 No way. I like him on the oil. Can’t afford nyl at 8 mill
5114 2018-10-05 19:50:56 ADA and opec don’t want facts to get out, media outlets are paid to trash @Tesla,  31 years in the automotive industry and I’ve never see this level of organization after one company. Hell I was around for the birth of anti lock brakes and this Tesla bashing exceeds that. #oil$
5115 2018-10-05 19:50:55 DOCTOR Ford, @SenatorCollins, Dr. Ford. And this woman is not swallowing a drop of the snake oil you're selling. #partybeforecountry #partybeforewomen
5116 2018-10-05 19:50:49 It was more than those 3 from what I remember but - too lazy to google right now. It was around when it came out that a bunch of companies were selling veg oil as olive oil.  
I wonder if it's the cellulose that makes it so you can't melt pre-shredded parmesan.

5121 2018-10-05 19:50:25 Everyone please be aware that when it rains these next couple days to drive carefully on the freeways especially. All the oil from the summer time is gonna be at the top of the roads meaning it will be easier for you to hydroplane/lose control. Plz go a little slower on freeway:)

5127 2018-10-05 19:50:05 Not yet! This is just something That I’ve been doing for years for me and my girls. And then their friends ask me for help. One of the girls mom owns a spa. She called me and I created a massage oil for her. Then all her clients started asking for it so i got a huge order.
5128 2018-10-05 19:50:02 Trump and his supporters are delusional. 
He is a snake oil salesman as you suggest, but his non-thinking supporters keep buying the snake oil.
5129 2018-10-05 19:50:00 If he told you what the different oils were you would have complained that he was mansplaining. How about YOU look up the oil that YOUR car needs and buy it. Just like the rest of us.
5130 2018-10-05 19:49:46 Well US Military weapons aren't made in China. USA has overtaken Saudi and Russia in Oil production. Well I don't know about CPEC, but Belt Road is a long time project. Recently Malaysia cancelled projects worth 12 billion dollars.. And unless big powers join it like Japan, Korea

5156 2018-10-05 19:46:06 I'm glad you asked. For starters we should not have wasted several billion on a old nearly worthless oil pipeline the previous owners were ecstatic to sell us. 
And now we could scrap plans to spend billions more expanding said pipeline since there is no business case for it.

People that support the oil and gas industry do care about the environment. Unfortunately you're so busy pushing false information you don't notice.

5171 2018-10-05 19:44:29 Energy in Depth is climate denial porn for the oil and gas industry.
5172 2018-10-05 19:44:28 If America goes to war with Iran as the neocons plan, the cost of oil will skyrocket to historically unseen levels. So now is the time to invest in the alternatives which people will have no choice but to turn to: solar power and wind power.

It’s all happening right in front of you and you can’t see it. Too bad. This is the most corrupt shitshow. 

Sorry you can’t see that.
5181 2018-10-05 19:43:12 Yes the govt had never cared or focused on that. Current govt cares deeply about it. Remember IKs first speech about stunted growth. INGOs can provide much needed support role as long as they abide by govt rules.
5182 2018-10-05 19:43:04 @SenatorCollins just wants to be bullied by the complicit gop traitor senators that are all getting paid off of the rosneft oil deal that trump Putin and Tillerson negotiated.

5212 2018-10-05 19:39:38 PSA: baby oil can and WILL cause yeast infections. Do not get it inside or near the vagina. Please buy real lube. 

Coconut oil is HORRIBLE and should not be used as a lube substitute either, Please just buy lube. 

Thank you.

5222 2018-10-05 19:38:52 After trump’s threat to them that’s what SA is saying. They are accepting oil payments from China  in yuan not the dollar, diversifying their weapons purchasing from other countries, and they want the S-400 missile system from Russia. All of these are ticking off the US.

Increasing forest cover give you a one time credit.  Alberta's forest cover is shrinking, giving a one time CO2 hit, on top of the oil industry and pickup love affair.

5238 2018-10-05 19:36:03 By the way, there is already a price on Carbon. It’s called the price of oil per barrel. And oil derivatives are subsidized indirectly by energy use. Cut oil-based energy to zero, get ready to pay $$$ for hospital tubing and latex gloves. This stuff isn’t extracted for free
5239 2018-10-05 19:35:56 @SenatorCollins would believe a “snake oil salesman.”  Republicans don’t “honor” their word anymore, have you been living in the bubble also?  Enjoy the next 2 years, you will be voted OUT in 2020! #RememberInNovember #VoteBlue2018 #GoodtobeBlue

5269 2018-10-05 19:32:38 First,Oil Prices are relatively high 4the American Consumer not because its prices are too high but because your government imposes too much Taxes on this strategic product !!On the other hand , Saudi Arabia has been paying excessively for anything it gets from the USA!Not Free!!
5270 2018-10-05 19:32:35 Doesn't the government make a fuckton of cash on the back of dividends paid out by the likes of ONGC? I think they can absorb such losses no problem. Rising oil prices will ultimately lead to inflation as transporting things gets more expensive.

5272 2018-10-05 19:32:27 So by saying that.   The unemployment rate will always be high in the eastern provinces.  No matter what year it is or what government it is.   Put for oil refineries down there and see how many will leave Alberta and decrease the unemployment rate.
5273 2018-10-05 19:32:21 Of course. Like father, like son when it comes to the oil industry. Quebec should be rewarded for producing these two by cutting their equalization payments. But then, why punish the entire province for two native sons who is so prejudice.

5280 2018-10-05 19:31:29 $103.00 for a oil change. Shit crazy
5281 2018-10-05 19:31:23 The way crude oil is created is a slow process requiring the right circumstances. We are consuming it way faster than it can possibly be replaced so yes I think we will run out.
5282 2018-10-05 19:31:21 I burnt down my kitchen.. I had save all my popsicle sticks and I finally had enough to make corndogs.
The oil caught on fire.
Thanks to my quick thinking and 10 year old brain. I immediately grabbed some water to put it out!

5289 2018-10-05 19:30:49 Does that include changing the purchase of palm oil to use in all your products which is killing Orangutans and their habitat!! oh no because it’s cheap and you don’t care as long as your all making enough money!!!

5302 2018-10-05 19:29:47 Yeah a standard oil change should not be $70 love. Maybe $50 at the most if you’re getting a high mileage oil change.
5303 2018-10-05 19:29:43 The appealing part of thermal solar is it is projected to be able to compete head to head without subsidies with the heavily subsidized oil industry.  Germany is over 27% of energy production from solar & wind. Their economy is doing well!

5336 2018-10-05 19:26:29 CBD OIL AND THC are wonderful cures.

Interviewed: “Oh no you must be mistaken I’ve neve-“
Interviewer:”RAPIST”
Interviewed:”NO IT WASN’T ME”
Interviewer:”Well no one with that attitude works here.  Good day”
5339 2018-10-05 19:26:14 If TV evangelists didn’t get tax breaks they would have to go back to selling snake oil or insurance instead of god

5342 2018-10-05 19:25:40 and to your latter point, oil may be much too valuable to just burn since ou can make all sorts of other things with it from plastics to fertilizer.
5343 2018-10-05 19:25:36 Quiero un oil.

5346 2018-10-05 19:25:30 Again I am for clean and green where it makes sense but look up graph of human development and prosperity some time. You'll see very little through history until internal combustion engine and use if oil.Then it takes off. Greener with balance.
5347 2018-10-05 19:25:28 $70 for an oil change? I didn’t sign up for this adult life 
5348 2018-10-05 19:25:23 Cleaned up the Journey Crossroads and changed the oil and filters.
5349 2018-10-05 19:25:12 Gwadar oil city is what ? We don’t need to prove to you ? Go to hell
5350 2018-10-05 19:25:11 You're a giant millennial moron for believing that lawsuit. All you had to do was look up the ingredient they're claiming is in it and realize its a natural alcohol that several fruits have in them and gets pulled into the fruit oil during the extraction process. SMH GTFO idiot
5351 2018-10-05 19:25:06 i been smelling this oil shit all day and i’m annoyed
5352 2018-10-05 19:25:04 Well, the "low price" of oil is also something of an illusion. It is a global market so a large part of our military budget is really an indirect oil subsidy (to keep the world safe for oil production & shipment). There are many direct subsidies for equipment and facilities.
5353 2018-10-05 19:25:04 So grateful for this powerful oil! 
5354 2018-10-05 19:24:51 I feel for you  I find my CBD oil from a new licensed producers works nicely, much better than the ones from other licensed producers. Sometime you just have to sleep it off. Give yourself some love

5364 2018-10-05 19:23:22 So you are in favour of nuclear but not fracking? And pulling oil out the North Sea is hardly environmentally friendly.
5365 2018-10-05 19:23:15 @SCOTTShopTowels 
Always change oil and filter on a regular basis.  City driving is worse than freeway driving
5366 2018-10-05 19:23:09 And lots of vocal fry. Don't forget that annoying vocal fry.
5367 2018-10-05 19:23:00 some nonno in Italy... kneading the bread and making it fly like a ballerina, using tomatoes picked from his garden, olive oil from trees basking in the sun under the protection of the gods, the creamiest mozzarella and baking it in a hand built wood-fired oven... 
5368 2018-10-05 19:22:19 If it is really economically feasible I'm all for it. Issue has been that nothing is cheaper than oil. It's in everything too, gas, clothes, roads, food products, football helmets, aspirin, fertilizer, sun glasses,tires,basketballs,skis,golf bags,candles,fishing rods etc etc
5369 2018-10-05 19:21:32 Shame on you @SenatorCollins Your legacy will go down as a coward when the world looks back on the oil painting of you. Young girls will say "this is what a cowardly woman looks like."
5370 2018-10-05 19:21:27 Well, it's liberals making that claim, so...
5371 2018-10-05 19:21:09 I just chickened out on getting my oil changed bc I didnt know where to go in the building at 
5372 2018-10-05 19:21:08 Actually the culprit is still #CongDogAttack, because they were shouting madly on oil prices, and when govt did, they said, 2 rs me kya hoga, 20 kam karo.. @RahulGandhi - kya nifty ko 5 year low me le jaana hai? jab BJP full majority me aayi thi??
5373 2018-10-05 19:21:06 I realized just how tired I am. I was making coffee and went to the cupboard for.. of course, coffee..  I grabbed the cooking oil instead :/
5374 2018-10-05 19:20:56 So be it. Not like she will starve.  She has a good bankroll from the oil industry
5375 2018-10-05 19:20:53 The stock market and debt bubble can only thrive with the help from Asian Central Banks. First it was just Japan, yet then China, South Korea.... joined in a big way. When oil is high, China cannot support the US debt bubble anymore as then the capital must be diverted to oil.

5377 2018-10-05 19:20:36 This girl still ain’t got her oil changed. That’s crazy.
5378 2018-10-05 19:20:33 The only way to get us out of this mess is to have alternatives. The oil industry has allowed the growth of humanity in so many ways. Simply hiking prices only causes problems
5379 2018-10-05 19:20:29 The NATIONALIZATION of the SUEZ which was quickly followed by ANGLO-FRENCH-ISRAELI attack on EGYPT. An Oil embargo of some sorts was imposed when Egypt blocked the Suez Canal and Syria blew up the KIRKUK - TRIPOLI pipeline.

5382 2018-10-05 19:19:58 Every single time I fly, they want to pat my hair down. It never fails.

5383 2018-10-05 19:19:58 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
5384 2018-10-05 19:19:04 the only caveat is you need a decent oil waterproof eye makeup remover bc it is VERY permanent. it takes a little rubbing to get it off.

I’m not sure if I should apologize or accept thanks

5396 2018-10-05 19:17:59 I don't trust any technical patterns with commodities, especially #Gold or #Oil...
5397 2018-10-05 19:17:58 I think if you cut people up in small pieces and put them in hot oil, they pop right? Like pork rinds, maybe? Pretty much the same thing.
5398 2018-10-05 19:17:53 THe oil tanker?
5399 2018-10-05 19:17:43 

That was the thing that was really blowing my mind. How can some tomato on pasta with olive oil be so much better there then it is here? Just a few ingredients and absolutely perfection!
5400 2018-10-05 19:17:33 i just made albert ramen with 1 & 1/3 cups of water, sesame seed oil, and chili paste :) u taught me well
5401 2018-10-05 19:17:32 I never believed Nigeria was this hard until I saw my friend eating bread with anointing oil
5402 2018-10-05 19:17:23 funniest part of my birthday weekend was giving @senatorsal mint flavored CBD oil for anxiety and hearing him get progressively more unhappy with the taste 

hearing people talk while they keep liquid under their tongue is so funny
5403 2018-10-05 19:17:05 Chicken, ginger, ginger wine, goji, shiitake mushroom soup. Brown chicken legs in sesame oil with lots of ginger, add a bottle of ginger wine, add mushrooms and goji.

5405 2018-10-05 19:16:49 Good job President Trump. Every morning I wake up to the sound of a repeated thud. Its not an oil well, it's the Donald punching some sore loser in the stomach. It's like the drugs the obama fans were on. I just hope this sweet emotion never wears off. We stopped the communists!!
5406 2018-10-05 19:16:46 Using the CBD oil I feel like I’ve gone from having a 90 year old back to 19 years of age, won’t be long till I’m back playing football again!! I tell you it works wonders, it taste not great but I would do anything to be able to get up in the morning without having pain!
5407 2018-10-05 19:16:32 Clever, but you keep saying the cheapest energy source is expensive. You simply avoid facts at every turn.  As far as what's subsidized, oil is subsidized. gas is subsidized.

sorry to tell you girls but coconut oil is antibacterial and will disrupt the ph of your vagina, aint nothin sexy about that
5413 2018-10-05 19:16:15 STICKS?  Perhaps you've forgotten, sir,  but our high school put us in close proximity to an impressive array of pawn shops, bars, strip clubs, video shops and guns stores!  Everything a lonely oil field worker/service member could want!  Sticks indeed!
5414 2018-10-05 19:15:57 My recipe lasts two days. Boiled and cooled down edamame beans, celery, cucumber, lemon and lime juice, coriander leaves, sliced grapes or Apple pieces all chopped up except the beans a drizzle of olive oil and you are good to go!

5416 2018-10-05 19:15:55 How did Ripple end up with so many XRPs? We know how Chevron gets its oil.
5417 2018-10-05 19:15:49 I cover the oil and gas industry so obviously I need to watch the #Astros for research because Verlander is throwing straight gas.

Something fishy, as news floating of will continue buying oil from Iran, $ billion deal with Russia. Market could be anticipating US sanction. Did i get it right?

5421 2018-10-05 19:15:12 Looks really good...I'd like to see braided lines to the oil cooler, and the swingarm looks a bit spindly, but nitpicking!
5422 2018-10-05 19:15:03 Funny. Please what kinda oil was it???
5423 2018-10-05 19:14:57 Just Olive Oil and Salt will do nicely.

5426 2018-10-05 19:14:38 This week we learned about how to clean up an oil spill in science.We got to do an experiment with using different things to try to clean up oil spills. Some of the things we used to clean it up are cotton balls, paper filters, sponges, nylon, and felt. We had a great time! Maddy
5427 2018-10-05 19:14:26 Zakah Life CBD is a full spectrum CBD oil. There are a lot of brands that are only the isolate version which your body won’t fully absorb. It helps so much with deep sleep, inflammation, anxiety, overall just extremely beneficial!

5443 2018-10-05 19:12:44 Decision to buy Iranian oil & Russian arms seems good for national interests. But short term may have to face increase in FII outflow. Less USD requirement for oil will improve CAD situation increasing RBI's firepower to defend INR. Interesting times ahead. We can't surrender.

5457 2018-10-05 19:11:41 Just saying recessions get blamed on high oil, which is convenient but wrong. Our economy is fragile with a fake recovery that never was real. That is why it is so important for them to rig stock prices higher. Can you imagine what tax revenues would do if we went into recession?
5458 2018-10-05 19:11:38 May ALLAH (SWT) grant her shifa and provide her with a complete and speedy recovery. Ameen!

5474 2018-10-05 19:09:35 Moms used to make a nigga take the castor oil.... that shit was disgusting
5475 2018-10-05 19:09:30 Me: hi I need an oil change
Honda: actually you need to replace your brake, tires, and basically the whole mf car.
me: ...hi I need an oil change.
5476 2018-10-05 19:09:19 Burning the midnight oil again
Follow your arrow
5477 2018-10-05 19:09:18 Came in for an oil change, tire rotation and for them to check my brakes. Suddenly everything that’s expensive to fix I need right now for my car 
5478 2018-10-05 19:09:15 Oil goes up because greedy ceo's want more and governments want to squeeze the populas simple !
5479 2018-10-05 19:09:10 Lol came for a oil change and started looking around fell in love 
5480 2018-10-05 19:09:09 Kavanaugh is the oil spill that will poison the Supreme Court for a generation...in other news Jeff Flake was always a snowflake.
5481 2018-10-05 19:09:09 To save 7000cr of physical Deficit, oil companies reduce 1/ per litre of petrol and diesel, within two days companies loss 1lakh cr.
5482 2018-10-05 19:09:06 @DavidLenigas do you think railtankers an option for taking weald oil to refinery instead of road tankers atb big Dave 
5483 2018-10-05 19:09:03 Isn’t that a oil tycoon family name in Russia?
5484 2018-10-05 19:09:00 Darren’s use of emotive words trying to stir the passions of people who should be questioning Westminster, not the EU, is pathetic. Hopefully the Canadian inquiry will highlight the fact you bought snake oil and that your passion for a Britain long gone is just not worth it.
5485 2018-10-05 19:08:58 2018 Budget benchmark for crude oil was $51. Crude oil has averaged $70 in 2018, yet we have huge revenue problems. But election season is distracting us. @DoubleEph should you not be telling compatriots that fuel will sell for N200 & above next year? Or is my fear unfounded?
5486 2018-10-05 19:08:19 my coworker let me borrow her diffuser today because she noticed I have a cold and it has eucalyptus oil or some shit and after 3 hours: holy fuckballs, my sinuses are clear, my crops are thriving, etc etc

5488 2018-10-05 19:08:05 Depends on the kind of headache but lavender essential oil and massage your neck and/or temples (circulation). Some people say ginger tea but not sure about that.
5489 2018-10-05 19:07:32 Even engine oil...
5490 2018-10-05 19:07:25 Methinks more dan 75% take less than dt (abt 1.4m). It's really a sad tale. For decades, we've hd a vicious cycle of sm moment of fiscal respite when oil price goes up n calamity when it goes south. No matter who governs, nothing unless power supply n industrialisatn shoot up.
5491 2018-10-05 19:07:23 Would love to rub some sun oil all over that hot body 
5492 2018-10-05 19:07:07 Some just don’t like progress? Has this gentleman got a better option for when we run out of oil and other fuels???
5493 2018-10-05 19:07:04 Waiting for my car to get an oil change is my only break today at work but I’m grateful for it.
5494 2018-10-05 19:07:03 @lisamurkowski @realDonaldTrump  helped your state -ANWR for oil drilling.

5496 2018-10-05 19:06:56 The future isn't written. Trump is cruising in a car powered by the economic engine Obama put together, but, to extend a metaphor, he's not taking care of it. the oil hasn't been changed, the "Check Engine" light is on, and economists predict it'll seize up on him before 2020.
5497 2018-10-05 19:06:55 Not so clear these days--remember that US is now neck and neck with Russia as world's top oil producer. So oil producing states--which tend to be Trump states -- benefit
5498 2018-10-05 19:06:55 Had a huge healthy lunch full of probiotics. Everything pickled, soaked in lemon juice, olive oil etc. Now I’ll have another coffee and a donut.
5499 2018-10-05 19:06:50 Plenty of US oil to invest in TY.

5505 2018-10-05 19:05:53 coconut oil does nothing for me. olive oil is where it's at. thank my nana later
5506 2018-10-05 19:05:40 cannabis oil.  several states carry it, find it, learn the quantities you need and she will be cured in 6 months.  it is really that easy.  may God be with you.
5507 2018-10-05 19:05:38 Tunechi. She nice like olive oil, I call her a weekend. Fireman.
5508 2018-10-05 19:05:32 why does getting my oil changed give me such high anxiety
5509 2018-10-05 19:04:53 After the Trump pressures: #Saudi Crown Prince says #OPEC and partners including #Russia boosted oil output by 1.5m b/d, double the 700k-barrel drop by Iran. He says: “We export as much as two barrels for any barrel that disappeared from Iran. So we did our job and more.” #OOTT
5510 2018-10-05 19:04:51 "First, the Earth cooled. And then the dinosaurs came, but they got too big and fat, so they all died and they turned into oil..."
5511 2018-10-05 19:04:35 I hate getting an oil change but it’s been 8 months and I was supposed to get one in July HHHHHHHH
5512 2018-10-05 19:04:35 Isn't it 500 litres? Because they should all have the same amount of oil 
5513 2018-10-05 19:04:34 It was always the same with olive oil & peppermint essence - that came from the chemist too!

5519 2018-10-05 19:03:58 Too late for that. In a normal world you would have been committed for observation a long time ago. You should seek help, seriously.
5520 2018-10-05 19:03:53 Emerald city guitars - go and see their gear - he gave me a tel Ray oil can delay last time - dope vintage shit every time

5522 2018-10-05 19:03:42 Many ways. Your very question reflects the problem we, as Canadians face. Are you seriously saying you can't think of any yourself? Looking to last century to solve our future problems can only end badly.
Throwing $ at the unviable business of the oil sands is the poorest answer
5523 2018-10-05 19:03:40 That's UK governance for you!  Oil Capital of Europe!! 
5524 2018-10-05 19:03:38 Just got a oil change. its probably cheaper if i do it myself.
5525 2018-10-05 19:03:31 My mom has stage three and the tumors have drastically reduced.  We have her on pancura c it’s a dog dewormer I know it sounds crazy but John Hopkins is actually studying it.  We also put her on a medical grade cbd oil 2000mg along with chemo.  She has greatly improved.
5526 2018-10-05 19:03:18 #WJZ Paying more for gasoline is likely to continue according to AAA. Crude oil prices are near a 4-year high and we're paying 39 cents more per gallon now than the same time last year.

5528 2018-10-05 19:03:10 Getting a little frustrated with Firestone. Had an appt @ noon for an oil change and to rotate and balance my tires. Took an hour to get my car back, and they are just now almost done.  Might be time to find a new place.
5529 2018-10-05 19:02:59 I asked my mom to borrow her car tonight because i need to change the oil in my car and she had the nerve to ask me if I’m meeting a guy 

I mean is @MeganNicole_3 a guy

5532 2018-10-05 19:02:36 The only way to escape these Americans is micro grid projects out at sea. Wait for them to die off from their GMO SEEDLESS foodweb entering peak oil. We don’t have to wait much longer. Let’s get ready to build sanctuary with @OTEcorporation @NorCalAquaponix @PermacultureMag
5533 2018-10-05 19:02:33 California to Mexico in return for them building the wall
Hawaii to china in return for a good trade deal
Keep Alaska for the oil
5534 2018-10-05 19:02:32 I steal a month here or there (kinda like oil changes) but it is good practice.
5535 2018-10-05 19:02:29 Crazy how there’s people that just hop into their cars and drive. They don’t check tires, oil or if they have coolant smh
5536 2018-10-05 19:02:26 Congratulations city oil
5537 2018-10-05 19:02:24 Agreed. And that extends beyond affordable housing.  The appropriate philosophical underpinnings for #affordablehousing #mobility evolution, being a shill for oil and gas, all are a siren we need leaders who are progressive and walk the walk.  Talk vs action.
5538 2018-10-05 19:02:24 I swear almost every mom went through an essential oil phase
5539 2018-10-05 19:02:18 She needs Rick Simpson oil made out of the whole cannabis plant.  The THC is what kills the cancer.  If she gets it now there is a chance she can be cured.  She needs to google and youtube Rick Simpson oil and Dr. Raphael Mechoulam from Israel.
5540 2018-10-05 19:02:17 Gulf states can cover the bill with about 10 minutes of oil income.
5541 2018-10-05 19:02:12 Yes I can’t do the oil I take capsules instead
5542 2018-10-05 19:02:07 High oil prices force Asian Central banks to redistribute trade surpluses to oil purchases (and not into currency reserves, which finance the US deficits). This way, around 700 bn USD are diverted into oil. Oil is crowding out debt.

5550 2018-10-05 19:01:13 does anyone w severe anxiety use cbd oil i have questions
5551 2018-10-05 19:00:58 I hope that means lower crude oil price.

5554 2018-10-05 19:00:41 He did make one good point: Asking senators what they want people to think about them while staring at their oil portrait (Cuz they imagine they will have one, lol) and how they'll go down in history. This oft gives them pause. Even if they still do sociopatic things thereafter.

5560 2018-10-05 18:59:38 Coconut oil is purely saturated fat (that’s one of the bad kinds) and is not a healthy substitute for olive oil #FunFactFriday 
5561 2018-10-05 18:59:38 Rest all is fine and i agree to ur thought...but substitute of oil
Whatever Gidkari says ethanol is 2 yrs away and electric vechiles atleast 5-10 yrs by then it aill be tooooo late.
Nov when sanctions kick in then lets see if they hv figured a way to get oil frm iran
5562 2018-10-05 18:59:34 I have it too coconut oil really helps. I only use it on my arms though my face doesn’t react all too well to it and I also use these vegetable tea tree soap bars from Trader Joe’s.
5563 2018-10-05 18:59:33 I know you love our recommendations, but I will tell you what helped my husband to overcome. Elderberry syrup and doterra essential oils(onguard,lemon,oregano and T tree mixed in carrier oil). Start at first symptoms and we have 90% success rate of quick end of symptoms.
5564 2018-10-05 18:59:32 cannabis oil?
5565 2018-10-05 18:59:26 Bonita!
5566 2018-10-05 18:59:00 Rick Simpson oil. Hard to pinpoint of course but anecdotal success.
5567 2018-10-05 18:58:43 @SecretaryPerry it's time to sell our gasoline & home heating oil here to the citizens of the #USA. #WeThePeople are being ripped off at the gas pumps & by the big oil companies. #MAGA #AmericaFirst
5568 2018-10-05 18:58:21 Nobody can do anything as it was only chidambaram who caused all that. Had he not reduced prices of diesel and petrol artificially by way of oil pool account deficit and by issuing oil bonds, the problem would have got arrested then and their but due to deficit financing the prob
5569 2018-10-05 18:58:16 Bro one of the express advisors came to the shop YELLING at me about an oil change sticker so I finished the car I was doing and went to lunch when he needed me to be there to finish a couple more cars lmaoooooo
5570 2018-10-05 18:58:14 Rick Simpson Oil.  This is the best answer available on the planet.  Call Dr. Raphael Meschoulom in Israel.
5571 2018-10-05 18:58:07 Yes, & rosehip oil gathers your life as well! Lmfao you be knowinnnnn

5574 2018-10-05 18:57:45 Everytime I come to get an oil change they have the tv on HGTV. I’m not complaining one bit
5575 2018-10-05 18:57:31 Willie ass, went and brought that fucking motor oil shit tasted horrible

5579 2018-10-05 18:56:54 Truth is not his preferred sale pitch; snake oil demands a whiney, nasal pitch to be palatable.

5600 2018-10-05 18:53:42 Probably better too bec more cocoa and less palm oil
5601 2018-10-05 18:53:15 Marijuana was one ingredient in holy annointing oil from earliest days of The Jewish faith.
5602 2018-10-05 18:53:08 Cugat must have access to some top notch CBD oil.
5603 2018-10-05 18:52:55 I have to go get my tires checked , oil changed and car washed before I leave in the morning and there is just not enough hours in the day.
5604 2018-10-05 18:52:53 If the truth was to be told the USA is in  possession of advanced technology that would put coal/oil/nuclear out of business. The problem is that those who are invested in coal/oil/nuclear and very influential do not want the technology out in the open !
5605 2018-10-05 18:52:50 And another, more halting one:
'Big news! Pepsi has just announced that it will stop buying palm oil from Indofood -- and Nestlé has ended a 13 year Joint Venture Partnership with the palm oil villain -- after huge pressure from hundreds of thousands of SumOfUs members'.
5606 2018-10-05 18:52:48 The stupid decision im going to make today is putting biooil on my feet because blisters and i dont have anything that moisturize more than the oil

5610 2018-10-05 18:52:30 It's good to be the Crown Prince! His oil minister said the same in a meeting in Russia. Where Putin points out Trumps violation of international law with his sanctions on Iran which is perfectly clear to anyone who can read.
5611 2018-10-05 18:52:30 I was totally sure Otedola will never accept to be PDP candidate in Lagos laelae! Someone with serious interest in oil&gas will never go against the party at Abuja. If he want changes in Lagos, he just codedly fund Jimi Agbaje
5612 2018-10-05 18:52:30 @s_navroop bhai will there by iran oil waiver coming any time soon
5613 2018-10-05 18:52:28 The Joint Study Commission on Low THC Medical Oil Access is now hearing a presentation from Dr. David Bradford, Economist at @universityofga #gapol
5614 2018-10-05 18:52:20 What oil/lotion.... did you want to be rubbed with?? 
5615 2018-10-05 18:52:07 Her constituents also want to continue to receive those oil checks from the reopened drilling permits they were deprived of by O admin. So to me, oil and pipeline fodder doesn't make a lot of sense. 

We need to dig deeper.
5616 2018-10-05 18:52:00 Holy hell I can’t argue with you. “FPL says by 2020 the amount of it’s installed solar power to surpass the total amount of energy it has coming from coal and oil combined”. They are investing nearly $1BILLION this year alone. You sir are blinded by partisan bias.
5617 2018-10-05 18:51:52 It's interest rates not oil prices.
5618 2018-10-05 18:51:50 Youtube OIC - oil rich countries infiltrated UN EU to spread their cult Europe and America while condemn Israel. EVIL

5626 2018-10-05 18:50:35 President Trump inherited an economy that was an upswing. President Buhari inherited an economy that was going downhill. As at May 2015, Dr Iweala confirmed FG was borrowing to pay salaries. Many states were owing salaries. Oil price was going down. False comparison sir
5627 2018-10-05 18:50:27 None of these male party goers drank? Media generally has very little credibility anymore. 
Worst part is majority of them just dont care. They still pump out lies and propaganda daily. 
Given the state of journalism, is this  fabricated nonsense? Who knows
5628 2018-10-05 18:50:26 I just need a company that sells pure whipped shea and avocado oil with no other ingredients.
5629 2018-10-05 18:50:25 It lasted about 3 days the first time I went keto. Eating more fat def helps. Try adding mct oil to coffee, tea, salad dressing, etc. Good luck!

USA Carbon emissions lowest on earth. North Korea on the verge of denuclearizing. DNC in chaos. TRUMP? Working hard to MAGA
5632 2018-10-05 18:49:53 #SEJ2018 @EricLiptonNYT: One of the first things @EPA did after Trump taking office was canceling a data call on oil and gas industry methane emissions. If you don’t have the data, you can’t enforce the rule. Brilliant.

5634 2018-10-05 18:49:46 But apart from maintaining our traditional good relation with Russia we must play the China card to our advantage to extract more concession in our favor such as buying oil from Iran without any US sanctions. This wud also force the Saudis to cool down the oil mkt
5635 2018-10-05 18:49:43 She will not be re elected. The GOP will keep the senate & she needs to be put on useless committees & President Trump needs to stop any support for the oil industry in Alaska & use those resources elsewhere.

5646 2018-10-05 18:48:01 CBD oil in a capsule seems to be far superior to the oil you drip in your mouth but that's my personal experience. Also, where you buy it makes a difference.

5648 2018-10-05 18:47:57 so the Left media is bought out and corrupt and compromised. also there were fake Left people at Standing Rock who were infiltrators, informants, agent provoceteurs and mercenaries. they helped out the oil company, the local police, the FBI, probably the CIA and their donors.
5649 2018-10-05 18:47:35 India seals the deal for S-400 SAM systems despite American pressure. India will also purchase 2.5 lakh tonnes of oil from Iran despite threat of American sanctions. This is how you stare back at the bully USA.

5676 2018-10-05 18:45:00 •Be more aware at intersections 
oCar usually leave oil on the road, where they have stopped, and it becomes more slippery when it rains
oDo not ride on any painted road markings, surface is slippery when wet.

5680 2018-10-05 18:44:45 As a person who has an electric stove if you don’t clean the drip pans, they’ll set fire real quick. So that on top of the oil was probably way too hot and throwing water on it. 
5681 2018-10-05 18:44:41 It doesn’t matter all oil goes through a refining process.
5682 2018-10-05 18:44:40 I have. The one by Deciem. It's okay, not a holy grail. I'll be going back to serums once it's done. I find mixing it with an oil makes it easier to apply.
5683 2018-10-05 18:44:30 I was spit balling about the oil spit combod w shark bomb- you could literally lock a healer out of doing anything by yourself.

5722 2018-10-05 18:40:50 That said I had a momentary freak out until I read the article: Popular Science magazine considers the lawsuit a stretch.

Ms. McDuffie’s class would agree. Oil production pollutes. Bitumen production from tar sand pollutes more.

5884 2018-10-05 18:21:59 Your Source: South Korea is refusing to buy oil from Iran. 
It is true. 
About EU : absolutely false. 
So how do you call your source reliable ? From 4 claims, 3 are completely false !

5891 2018-10-05 18:20:43 for oily skin, try to refrain from using anything with oil and go for water-based moisturizers/products. Exfoliate and mask at least 2-3x a week. Remember you want to reduce excess oil, but not strip your skin. It could cause more oil build up
5892 2018-10-05 18:20:28 What do you use rose oil for?
5893 2018-10-05 18:20:28 Really?
And world economists & financial institutions are saying the Indian economy is steady; it will weather oil, currency, trade, FPIs moving out funds; it is a resilient economy.

5908 2018-10-05 18:19:15 So your source says: China: Imports of Iranian oil are declining since months. This is completely false. See the past tweets.

5926 2018-10-05 18:17:59 That's the problem is that people think insurance and healthcare are somehow intrinsically tied.  You do not have to do a claim every time you got your tires rotated or your oil changed. Because insurance is not a car maintenance decision.

5934 2018-10-05 18:17:03 Bloomberg: Has he (Trump) made a specific request about oil?

MBS: Yes, actually the request that America made to Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries is to be sure that if there is any loss of supply from Iran, that we will supply that. And that happened

5936 2018-10-05 18:16:43 While a half dozen or more countries pass us in alternative energy reliance and development. We'll just be sitting here giving oil companies profits and continuing to pollute thanks to the Trump administration.
5937 2018-10-05 18:16:35 If I have to go to Alaska from Florida  I would make sure that she never gets elected again. Just look what President Trump did for Alaska, expanding the oil industry. How much did Obama accomplish?
5938 2018-10-05 18:16:25 The term "renewables" is a 1970's hippy marketing term.  If we did not have oil (hydrocarbon based industrial system), the making of solar panels and wind turbines would be prohibitively expensive.  They are great as emergency power, but cannot run a civilization of 9 billion.

5960 2018-10-05 18:14:43 So which war has Trump ended? You know the answer is zero. All talk, & his actions actually reveal the opposite.

5992 2018-10-05 18:10:35 I didn't that the US sanctions have no impact. These sanctions are hurting the Iranian people. But EU, China, and India will continue to buy oil from Iran. Trump cannot stop Iran's oil export altogether.

6018 2018-10-05 18:07:51 It's not JUST that he's a rich lying rapist, Kavanaugh is remarkably unqualified for the job and he's only getting it because he'll protect our treasonous rich lying rapist snake oil salesman of a president
6019 2018-10-05 18:07:50 Crude oil Nov18 70 Puts trade 494 times
6020 2018-10-05 18:07:35 We don't have to get rid of oil products... We mostly just have to stop burning it for energy, which isn't really that hard if we want it to happen. The biggest obstacle is greed/profit not technology
6021 2018-10-05 18:07:32 I sell the highest CBD oil on the market at this time
6022 2018-10-05 18:07:26 ★★★★
"Thank you for having such accommodating, talented personnnel. We needed an oil change and recently learned that the alignment was out. They took care of everything. Yeah!"

6023 2018-10-05 18:07:26 Waited for two weeks to get oil so I can have heat in the house

Oil was finally delivered this morning

Still no heat. Ugh!
6024 2018-10-05 18:07:21 Bakit ang hapdi ng efficascent oil sa underboob???
6025 2018-10-05 18:07:19 I have tried chamomile tea and I had no luck. I will try eucalyptus oil first then allergex if it doesn't work. 

I'm always fatigued because of lack of sleep, kuyabhowa.
6026 2018-10-05 18:07:18 The drop in issued permits could be due to a number of reasons other than oil prices. There might have been an issue in the permitting office that resulted in fewer issued or they weren't reported in time for this report. We'll know more next week.
6027 2018-10-05 18:07:14 No Ewan you explain to us why fracking would work as your obviously pro fracking by your statement.its also crazy how we (scotland have more oil in our possession than similar nations yet pay an extortionate levy in fuel duty do you think fracking will solve this ?
6028 2018-10-05 18:06:57 Solidarity, something that is an under current argument for Labours anti Scots independence stance, I wonder what their policy was with Poland leaving the Soviet Union "nah , stay until everyone leaves?" or Ireland and Britain.

Labourr's Socialism = Solidarity with Scottish Oil.
6029 2018-10-05 18:06:47 the place I take my car for an oil change is always jukin with cute ass guys. blesssedt
6030 2018-10-05 18:06:38 There’s CBD oil I’ve heard that works really good but it’s a process & expensive, idk if your school would even accept that. I feel you on the addiction part that’s why I’ve been so hesitant to get on them. I’ve tried things like essential oils, but those things only work so much
6031 2018-10-05 18:06:22 Bout to cut off this guys cojones and burn em in motor oil
6032 2018-10-05 18:06:10 Hope trump puts oil restrictions back on them
6033 2018-10-05 18:06:01 Sleep and architecture is  like water and oil, shit just don’t mix well. 
6034 2018-10-05 18:05:52 I use coconut oil
6035 2018-10-05 18:05:16 Unfortunately, sun will never be more tempting than oil 
6036 2018-10-05 18:05:14 I smell of Moroccan Oil and I love it 
6037 2018-10-05 18:05:02 Grocery shopping 
Food prep 
Clean kitchen 
Schedule oil change 

Now I can spend the rest of the afternoon researching bird caging
6038 2018-10-05 18:05:01 That it is. It’s a V6 Diesel and it looks like the oil cooler seals have gone. They’re right down in the valley of the v block so, an absolute bitch to get to. Plus, it could be the rear crank main, in which case it’s a a gearbox our job. 

Just a car though. Metal & plastic 
6039 2018-10-05 18:04:55 Gov can reduce more VAT as crude oil price is low at present ,if crude oil price increases in future then can move accordingly
6040 2018-10-05 18:04:38 Cut in half, drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle favorites spices, roast in oven then freeze.  Add to soups, sauces, etc throughout winter.

6042 2018-10-05 18:04:32 @techring @rachaelwarke Good segway from playing Chris’s advert into Midnight Oil
6043 2018-10-05 18:04:16 There was spinach on as well. Onion, garlic, thyme, oregano, beets, spinach. Little pepper. Sweat it all down with olive oil in a pan and then dump on a pizza crust with sliced goat cheese and bake for 10 mins at 350. (I use already-baked bases.)
6044 2018-10-05 18:04:16 So the ordinary Moroccan argan oil smells like literal manure but i also cant justify spending £3 bus fare to go return a £6 product the post office
6045 2018-10-05 18:04:11 Whose the fool here? It's simple economics. US energy exports DIRECTLY compete with Russia's. Energy exports are of vital importance to them. Trump is making it more affordable to produce energy in US. Thus we are now #1 in oil exps. It is grossly ignorant not to know this.
6046 2018-10-05 18:04:10 @BobPisani clearly @Tesla is under pressure from shorts who include large players that have co-opted the media in an attempt to thwart the popularity of electric cars and the lessening of oil dependence. @elonmusk stay strong, keep pushing. #fightthepower
6047 2018-10-05 18:03:46 CBD Oil has so many health benefits plz message me for more information
6048 2018-10-05 18:03:42 Eyyahh...pele dear

6049 2018-10-05 18:03:40 Even worse, by not confirming Kavanaugh the 9th Circuit will be deciding land, oil and gun/hunting rights for Alaska. 
I can't see her constituents liking that..
6050 2018-10-05 18:03:38 Jo fa anys que faig benzina a @bonpreuesclat oil i mai he tingut problemes ni en el consum ni en el rendimet del cotxe. Els prejudicis son llegendes fomentades pel sistema oligopolistic d’aquest país. En altres àmbits també és el mateix.

6053 2018-10-05 18:03:12 I'm surprised. Would such forecasts with a wide bandwidth add any value to futures or physical traders? If so, what is the acceptable minimum and maximum standard deviation/variance for the crude oil and petroleum products, amongst OTC dealers? #OOTT #oil #crude #energy #OPEC
6054 2018-10-05 18:03:11 All my internal organs got together to stage an intervention with my brain so he'll stop getting me to put hot chili oil on everything I eat. #pain
6055 2018-10-05 18:03:09 I thought data was the new oil, now it’s crypto? Shit moves so fast I can’t even keep up with what the newest oil is!
6056 2018-10-05 18:03:06 Ever since I started cooking with coconut oil I just can't stop
6057 2018-10-05 18:03:03 I just did, with potato spice and olive oil and it's so fuckn delicious
6058 2018-10-05 18:03:01 My aunt has cancer and that CBD oil has helped her tremendously.
6059 2018-10-05 18:02:57 The brothers are just in it for the $$$.  Not sure they believe this any more than Alex Jones believes the tripe he spouts while selling snake oil.

6063 2018-10-05 18:02:21 The crushing of the olives is a persevering place to be. But remain in Him & remain in His timing. Cuz the oil that's being produced is filling u up in this"now" season. So it is imperative not to rush..for what is filling u up now is going to be released in this upcoming season
6064 2018-10-05 18:02:20 Yes thank you President Obama for building the foundation that has led to unprecedented growth over 8 years now!!!!
Such an accomplishment

Donald did you see the oil prices today almost $75 per barrel, up from $33 when you took office

Everything is costing more under your lead
6065 2018-10-05 18:02:15 No, Sweden is often held up as a socialist state but it’s not. It’s actually a free market economy with significant redistribution. The state does own oil manufacturing but nothing else. I am a Republican.
6066 2018-10-05 18:02:13 No one expects You to think for yourself. Go ahead and drink the  oil aid!

6072 2018-10-05 18:01:32 Trump needs to stop all new oil drilling in Alaska now.
6073 2018-10-05 18:01:28 Wow, never thought they are going to change their mind about oil in that part of the world. I assume that #sun as an energy source is more tempting than #oil , at least now :)

6078 2018-10-05 18:01:02 The only essential oil that matters is beard oil
6079 2018-10-05 18:00:47 US rig count -2 to 1,052, with oil rigs -2 to 861, Canada +4 to 182 rigs, with oil rigs -3 to 119, says @BHGECO #OOTT #oilandgas
6080 2018-10-05 18:00:45 You should try Jason and the Argan Oil or BIG, I can let you try some of the second one. Their hair product is really drying so I only use it when I need a squeaky clean feel. It’s weird cause their founder is a trichologist so it’s like cmon guys lol
6081 2018-10-05 18:00:42 @BarackObama took us to junk yard, found a car. @realDonaldTrump took car put a new engine, fresh paint job, new tires, & now that the car is running good, Democrats want the keys. They will never change the oil, will never put on new tires & will put low octane gas in. #TheFive
6082 2018-10-05 18:00:27 I can actually handle a lot more spice. I’ve been using chili oil in my food, thank u very much.

6089 2018-10-05 17:59:59 Buddy, Iran’s oil exports have already dropped from 3 million a day to 1.6 million a day in less than 6 months and sanctions have not even started yet. Can I ask what you are smoking?

6094 2018-10-05 17:59:29 And by "tried to rob a gas station", do you mean "launched an invasion of Mexico to seize their oil production facilities"?
6095 2018-10-05 17:59:25 Chair?
Coffee?
I thought you British boffins worked in sheds and drank tea with oil covered hands as the missus sat inside complaining to her friend about you spending too much time in there. But at least it keeps you out of trouble.
6096 2018-10-05 17:59:21 My organic lip balm has sativa seed oil in it... Well, that’s organic all right lol
6097 2018-10-05 17:59:20 Extra sugar, extra salt

6098 2018-10-05 17:59:03 #Trumpov has nothing to do with it. Just watch when oil goes to $100 pb.
6099 2018-10-05 17:58:55 “We are one of the major carriers for crude oil from the US to China. Before [the trade war] we had a nice business, but now it’s totally stopped” - Xie Chunlin, president of CMES.

This amounts to 334,880 barrels of oil per day no longer exported from the US to China.
6100 2018-10-05 17:58:40 @realDonaldTrump If Lisa Murkouski votes against Kavanaugh you should cancel the oil exploration in ANWR.

6105 2018-10-05 17:58:12 Is there a different way to detect oil industry corruption of government? Cuz you bought out our media... 

Do you have a satellite for that CAPP?

6106 2018-10-05 17:58:10 Man tea tree oil works so good for your face . This is my first time using it and just after a few hours , I can already tell a difference . My skin looks so bright and clean and it’s so soft 
6107 2018-10-05 17:57:58 Please don't side with the left.  the same left that would love to strip all the oil companies out of Alaska and leave it with a huge unemployment problem.

6111 2018-10-05 17:57:43 Finally getting my oil changed today. It was supposed be done 4300 miles ago
6112 2018-10-05 17:57:38 I also have trouble sleeping. Try chamomile tea or spray your pillows with eucalyptus oil. Or allergex, it knocks me TF out!
6113 2018-10-05 17:57:23 Blend fresh ginger and fresh lime juice. It burns, it stings, you will hate everything...but it works wonders! Plus oregano oil! The students at my work tested it in the lab and found it killed bad bacteria quickly! Makes your breath smell like gasoline for a couple hours though
6114 2018-10-05 17:57:18 Stephanie Garcia Richard is ready to be our 1st Woman Land Commissioner. Not rich, does not take oil & gas$. Ready to manage our state land & mineral rights, oversee leases & royalties in NM. Let's elect SGR for a fresh new vision.#nmpol, @NMDEMS, @LosAlamosDems

6120 2018-10-05 17:56:40 Was that the days you used to walk / swim in oil?
6121 2018-10-05 17:56:37 Waited two and a half  hours for a oil change.... thanks Walmart.
6122 2018-10-05 17:56:26 Ha! The ones I buy from the store are complicated enough for me. I buy candy and oil and things for the bathtub in there. The smoke is hard to take. I can just pull some in my mouth and keep it in there for a while. Still works
6123 2018-10-05 17:56:21 It’s the Orange School of Oil Policy.
6124 2018-10-05 17:56:15 Democrat tactics hasn't changed! The people delivering the scam has! They have very low IQ and no common sense to sell their snake oil to Americans! Their are a few like Hollywood who are even more dumb and detached from reality and Americans that still drink these fools koolaid!
6125 2018-10-05 17:56:15 Ed,you still haven't #WalkAway ? Oh well, maybe you'll wise up and realize the majority are buying the snake oil your selling after the 2018 and 2020 elections. #MAGA #KeepAmericaGreat #ConfirmKavanaughNow #VoteRedMidterms2018 #VoteRED2020
6126 2018-10-05 17:56:13 Honestly almond oil has been a big game changer for me really helps keep frizz down and keeps my hair soft. A little goes a long way being combed thru wet hair
6127 2018-10-05 17:56:09 いいぞぉ～これ！
6128 2018-10-05 17:56:07 Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Do not brush hair when wet. Stress can cause hair loss. Is it NISIM or NHB? A good hair loss shampoo. Give or take. How on earth do I come across the true and official portal. Gentle to hair. Worked so well.
6129 2018-10-05 17:56:05 Oh! I know. By putting oil in vessels that eventually fail, spilling oil everywhere and destroying pristine coastlines and remote wilderness areas?
6130 2018-10-05 17:55:56 Things I need to do today:
1. Get an oil change
2. Go to the bank
3. Grocery shop

1. Open the same 5 apps over and over on my phone 
2. Still not left bed

6133 2018-10-05 17:55:40 Yes I’m ordering those today along with maca root & black seed oil to see what works .. hopefully i find a routine cause having this is so frustrating .. I’m slowly getting better tho .. hope you get well too 
6134 2018-10-05 17:55:38 Pres Trump of USA- This isn't no time to go out on a limb my man... Powers that Are planning on flushing you down the toilet... This Oil crises is real & coming to fruitation as we speak... Oil about ready to hit $100 barrel range...This will crush President's Heart. Withdraw NOW
6135 2018-10-05 17:55:28 Profit in oil more than doubled or trippled even if US sanction reduces iran oil supply to half, still more profit to iran, and there is always extra oil available with them for exchange of good for oil...

6140 2018-10-05 17:55:00 Since people have been consuming energy from coal, oil and gas which are the cause of global carbon dioxide emissions. So, for reduction in emissions, we needed #Worldwide birth control.  @UN #climatechange #USA
6141 2018-10-05 17:54:49 I visited Shani temple many times. In this temple, women were allowed in this temple, only the issue was they were not able to enter the dias for oil pour on the idol. Now the temple authorities put a fence there and restricted everyone to  pour oil and touch idol.  1/2
6142 2018-10-05 17:54:32 Zero new power stations needed if everyone switched to electric cars. There will already be electricity saving by not refining oil into gasoline, & most cars will be charged at night during low demand. Plus cheaper renewables will continue to push thermal plants out of the market
6143 2018-10-05 17:54:03 Great photography, it looks like a oil painting! Really neat
6144 2018-10-05 17:53:57 Privat auto industry, oil industry, power companies, governments collecting revenue on oil & power all have money to lose when @elonmusk comes and turns the faucet full blast when they had it set to sprinkle

6147 2018-10-05 17:53:25 I really want to do a research paper on the impacts of dishonesty on stock price. Case study example: the BP oil spill. 

When companies are caught in scandals that are legal but unethical, how does, if at all, lying impact the stock price.

I’m going to try to make that happen
6148 2018-10-05 17:53:25 What separates Israel and the atrocities they commit against Palestinians from Putin, Hitler, Stalin etc? NOTHING. Because US interests in having military bases in the oil region, they turn a blind eye which is appalling. Collateral damage as a result of Russia/Trump collusion.

6154 2018-10-05 17:53:07 The same west that supports apartheid, has colonised most of the 3rd world, used black peoples as slaves, bombs fuck out of countries for oil. That west? What now because we let migrants contribute to white peoples fortune, we’re all of a sudden not racist and the oppressed?

6157 2018-10-05 17:53:02 Yes, at that time they so loved to keep us updated on the oil price, but not so much now. Can’t imagine for the life of me why....
6158 2018-10-05 17:52:59 @lisamurkowski ...so let me get this straight... by you voting NO, you are telling everyone that you are RIGHT and all 50 other Senators are WRONG.....Well aren’t you “Special”. ...just a little tidbit...50:1 odds very seldom pays off in life or “oil drilling off shore”

6161 2018-10-05 17:52:57 Senator Murkowski you took a bold step in your NO vote. And yes Judge Kavanaugh is a good man and should be confirmed. Being from an energy state that relies on the oil and gas donation. I don’t think you will be getting their support from here on.
6162 2018-10-05 17:52:49 Venezuela has the world’s largest oil reserves but it’s a shit hole. If we knew our economic trajectory people might weep but God loves us!!

6168 2018-10-05 17:51:30 That’s great right now but it’s like the oil field it’s on a boom then what? Thats why the crafts are so bare because the work isn’t always steady. Keep it level and craftsman will come back.

As a young man I told my peers: "I only shall marry a woman which is beautiful, sexy, smart, and her father must own two large oil tankers. It didn't work out. Still I'm a very happy grandfather of 10 grandchildren.
6176 2018-10-05 17:50:34 . @SPGlobalPlatts Analytics: We recently raised our forecast of #Iranian #oil export losses from 1.4 to 1.7 Mm b/d & expect China/India/Turkey to continue to receive some Iranian #crudeoil.

6182 2018-10-05 17:49:57 This is oil on fire. What groceries does one buy with $10? You heavily taxing the poor and exempting the rich. It’s cumbersome to implement and monitor to say. This amendment is far worse than the original, it’s elitist & does not help expand the use of plastic money. #Regressing
6183 2018-10-05 17:49:33 I asked my mom if she needed to buy any more ingredients for Bun bò Huế. She told me “nw” because we had “all the ingredients”. I made myself a bowl this morning. Half of the meats were missing and we didn’t have spicy chilli oil. I feel so betrayed.
6184 2018-10-05 17:49:30 Pepperoni, oyster mushrooms, tuna, chilli flakes, garlic oil and after it’s cooked finish it off with rocket, shaved Parmesan and Caesar dressing 
6185 2018-10-05 17:49:16 This explains US and UKs constant anti Russian stance, they want to keep India reliant on their oil.

6190 2018-10-05 17:48:44 They probably oil pull. It’s actually a good practice I just don’t have the patience to go through the purging aspect of it

6193 2018-10-05 17:48:31 You want us to burn the midnight oil. @TelkomKenya why don't you have Internet bundles of 5,10, 20,30 shillings?
6194 2018-10-05 17:48:26 My mom said I should rub edficascent oil on my back since I have a cold and it's freezing so I did but now it feels even colder and I CAN'T SLEEP
6195 2018-10-05 17:48:25 Off days are for spending the whole day in my robes and oils.
Rosehip oil on my face
Coconut oil on my hair
Argain oil on my body
Bio oil again on my face

I need my oils! 
6196 2018-10-05 17:48:24 That’s because I once accidentally tipped over a bottle of some essential oil - it was rather overpowering for a while but much nicer now it’s muted.
6197 2018-10-05 17:48:22 Damn y’all really be getting oil changes often? That’s crazy. I haven’t had one since April
6198 2018-10-05 17:48:15 That's an Oil refinery,looks just like on we had for decades and was torn down years ago.
6199 2018-10-05 17:47:59 “Your face is all burnt!! You must go outside a lot” no I was aggressively using tea tree oil bc “self care” after not leaving the house for 3 days NEXT
6200 2018-10-05 17:47:42 Market was expecting at least 25 bps repo rate hike and measures to stabilise the rupee.Given the sell-off in the domestic equities and higher crude oil prices, the rupee is now expected to move towards 75-76 levels. But Iran deal can offset this let see
6201 2018-10-05 17:47:41 Oil spill!!
6202 2018-10-05 17:47:41 I wonder if her snake oil will remove spots on that pretty white blouse...?/
6203 2018-10-05 17:47:28 govt sud spend money on the projects which can be completed in next 6 months..govt expenditure is essential fr growth bt as private expenditure is increasing govt can reduce n check CAD India sud also find a way to buy Iranian oil @narendramodi @AmitShah @BJP4India @arunjaitley
6204 2018-10-05 17:47:24 I'll explain: I'm upset that protecting our natural environment is nothing compared to the short-term profit of oil drilling (in Alaska, for example). I'm pretty done with his constant inflammatory language and lack of respect for anybody who doesn't support him. Nothing he says
6205 2018-10-05 17:47:24 that’s usually how it is. When you check the oil you’ll be able to see if you need it plus your mileage. I went to Valvoline and paid 58$ bc I found a coupon code on retailmenot I think it was 10 off
6206 2018-10-05 17:47:24 God bless d architect

6209 2018-10-05 17:46:52 @sardanarohit Watched debate on high petrol prices. It's the same all over Europe,Australia,SE Asia. USA has own oil so I can't say. IN UK it's Rs.140/per litre. Compare that to India. Soon it's heading for $100/barrel.It's all because USA has stopped Iran to sell it's oil.
6210 2018-10-05 17:46:43 Pure coconut oil that u can get from any grocery store or baby don’t be bald. That shit WORKS
6211 2018-10-05 17:46:38 GREAT call on leaving a 4-4 deadlocked SCOTUS putting HIGHLY liberal 9th Circuit as final authority on anything regarding Alaska. Environmentalist would immediately file suit against Alaska on oil drilling ......... And win

6216 2018-10-05 17:46:09 The price of crude oil fluctuates each moment as it is publicly traded on an exchange. The price of crude is not only determined by global supply and demand and the fundamental outlook for the physical #commodity
6217 2018-10-05 17:46:02 In the movie Inside Job he's interviewed about the GFC and makes a very good point about the concentration of risk using an oil tanker analogy (oil is stored in separate tanks to avoid movement in one being amplified by the others)
6218 2018-10-05 17:46:00 ah, the glorious 1970s. when oil was plentiful, stagflation non-existent, and the president was an honest teetotaler
6219 2018-10-05 17:45:48 تيفو**
6220 2018-10-05 17:45:44 Exactly. It doesn't help that the GOP is to facts as Oil is to water.

6222 2018-10-05 17:45:36 Inflationary expectations due to crude & MSP warranted at least 25 bps hike. Tight liquidity & NBFC crisis prompted it to keep pause. Oil deal on Iran may possibly gave confidence on CAD going forward. Huge development if true
6223 2018-10-05 17:45:20 Money managers have cut their bullish ICE Brent crude oil bets by 14,398 net-long positions to 481,945, weekly ICE Futures Europe data on futures and options show.

6226 2018-10-05 17:45:07 My hope is that NDakota women, who have been threatened with rape like no others since the oil & gas boom brought all those rapist oil workers to their state as temp workers, will vote for Heitkamp and their own freedom from sexual assault.

6229 2018-10-05 17:44:58 This is what happens when the XRP corporation holds so many ripples.

You should be ashamed of yourself posting this!
6230 2018-10-05 17:44:58 Build our own countries like white people did. Ie colonising countries and turning them into 3rd world war zones for oil? Is that what you’re suggesting others should do to us?

6233 2018-10-05 17:44:51 That awkward moment when a toddler strips buck naked in a second ... at the oil change place... while they came in to tell me my car was done. 

Don't worry! I STILL managed to make it MORE awkward by talking about it! A lot!

...Sigh...


6234 2018-10-05 17:44:50 Supreme Court rules say he must recuse himself.
There is no legal requirement for him to recuse.  
He will not recuse himself.
Reason he is there is: get rid of women's rights to plan our own lives,  get rid of black/brown folks' rights, Ensure oil corps can drill in nat'l parks.

6241 2018-10-05 17:44:10 To get the privilege of being one of 9 people in America to be the final say on law is going to be (and should be) a very stringent, sometimes unfair (because politics) process of looking at the total package of the person. Some allegations seem far fetched, some needed inquiry.
6242 2018-10-05 17:44:00 because it's hard to say that they've earned it. has the team earned it ? yea sure. but their fanbase, not so much. brats spoilt by oil money.
6243 2018-10-05 17:43:53 Yes! Perfect even without the oil
6244 2018-10-05 17:43:34 How clever. Bow tell. Me what did the nobel price did vs the dancing with the stars guy? We got clean renewable energy with him? Did we made big breakthroughs? Did we spend less in oil?

6259 2018-10-05 17:41:19 Maybe Trump should pull the permits to drill in ANWR and the National Petroleum Reseve.  That should go over big in her welfare-laden state when the oil checks stop coming.

6278 2018-10-05 17:38:34 It's embarrassing. IF they had any self respect, they would call the US Ambassador in or call Trump directly and rebuke him. lower oil output for a bit and raise gas prices in US to hurt Trump. but we know they would never do that. boot lickers

6281 2018-10-05 17:38:04 he isnt a president he is a showman like old time snake oil sellers - he puts on the " trump show " to entertain his cult, sell them tat and get them to give him money ( campaign contributions ) for a presidential run in 2020 that will never happen - he'll have spent the money
6282 2018-10-05 17:37:59 I sit back and watch the world through eyeholes in my oil paintings.
6283 2018-10-05 17:37:56 Mom: I'm making you some egg rolls. Me: no thanks mom it has a lot of oil. Mom: *throws raw carrots at me* my daughter is a rabbit now
6284 2018-10-05 17:37:55 Sadly she is set until 2022...then head  for the Yukon with lifetime salary of $167K.. she could care less. #lameRICHduck @POTUS should take away Alaskan oil royalty payments blame it on her. Bet Alaska would run her out of the state
6285 2018-10-05 17:37:42 Best two words in sports: Game Day. Oh, guess what today is? IT’S GAME DAY Even better, it’s Oil Bowl Kickoff @ 6 @ KW. Be there or be  Theme is #WHITEOUT but if you don’t having anything #WARM that’s white that’s ok! Just come get rowdy #GIVEDEMDALICK #BLEEDORANGE
6286 2018-10-05 17:37:38 Why does every oil change place in the world try to scam women :-)))
6287 2018-10-05 17:37:35 Short thread on Oil & India:

* India consumes 4.6 million barrels per day vis-a-vis 2.9 million in 2008 - CAGR of 3.6%

* Every Indian consumes 1.18 barrels per year.  Was 0.94 barrels in 2008 - CAGR of 2.1%
6288 2018-10-05 17:37:31 The us will not stop the sanctioned party from using swift, but the counter party will be liable to sanctions, if they make a transaction using swift with the the sanctioned party this is how the us controls the oil
6289 2018-10-05 17:37:25 Cooking oil nw $5 sugar $3 at our place what will we transact with less than $10 Shef the way mnangagwa bought cars for party and chiefs will never restore confidence in ppl Its getting worse Tell hm to addres legitimacy first coz hazvibudi

6291 2018-10-05 17:37:19 Yes! I’ve read you have to be super careful with accutane! I’ve seen negative and positive stories. But, it’s risky. Really hoping this is the answer though. I’m tired of having oil slick skin which leads to constant breakouts 
6292 2018-10-05 17:37:18 The politicians on both sides are only out for the money they recieve from compnaies and large lobbyist groups who fund their campaign. NRA, Planned Parenthood, United Way, Disney, Oil Industries, etc. They could care less about their constituents.

Economy will stall out for the lower half of society...Federal Reserve is planning on sucking every dollar you got. To compensate for high oil prices... Oil will out price itself...all wrote down.

6298 2018-10-05 17:36:45 I went to a garage in Elkins once and had to wait there for 3 hours and pay $75 for a useless diagnostic test. In Mingo I drop my car off, they find the problem, order the parts, change my oil, rotate and balance my tires, and wash my car and I pick it up for free .
6299 2018-10-05 17:36:41 The closer an angry person gets to you, the greater the potential threat. 
Assessing this threat with all the chaos going on, surrounded by a sea of angry people shouldn't be required of our representatives. 
IMO, another event in the making.

6322 2018-10-05 17:34:27 Those people nationalized the oil once before, there is no reason to think that they would not do it again.

6333 2018-10-05 17:32:18 Trump’s Request for OPEC to Max-Out Oil Production May Backfire. High Gas prices are the greatest White House, who have hammered the Nail into their own Foot now running to OPEC No mention of Oil from Iran is the RESULT of current situation in USA.

6335 2018-10-05 17:32:09 Except this isn't a known trait. It's a fabrication brought on by apparent political opposition which triggered an additional hearing to the confirmation hearings. The original confirmation hearing wasn't all that far outside the norm. The subsequent hearings were.

And yes in Tripoli was the National Salvation government led by the PM Omar al-Hasi.
6340 2018-10-05 17:31:54 Ok $ denominated debt issued outside the us may not be in the us,, a foreign company or state wishes to buy oil outside the us  using those $ they have to use the SWIFT system which is essentially controlled by the us, a state sanctioned by the us cannot buy or sell oil

6344 2018-10-05 17:31:33 Sadly, rising oil prices are going to give the Fed some cover.  Higher oil slows the demand in the domestic economy, puts downward pressure on the dollar and allows OPEC to recycle more oil dollars into USTs.  Enough?, probably not.  Still a perverted world we live in.

6363 2018-10-05 17:30:05 Surprised to hear that India hasn't cut down on oil imports from Iran, though few private companies Reliance industries have totally stopped procuring from Iran. Has India secretly struck a deal with the US ? I'm bursting my brains here, I can't seem to fit any logical narrative.

6396 2018-10-05 17:27:10 And take the word of western academicians as gospel truth. That’s when you reach funny conclusions like coconut oil is poison and that Ramayana is not more than 400 years old. Be open to new ideas, be curious and be respectful of other sources of knowledge n/n

6419 2018-10-05 17:23:57 mmm... *does a quick think for an oven alternative...*

how about spraying/coating the chick-peas with some oil and then put 'm in the oven till they crisp up Kayleigh (at round 190-220 C will do the trick??)

better still....that might actually even be a low calorie/fat version!
6420 2018-10-05 17:23:53 @jmeacham noted historic “oil portrait test” seems to have determined that Jeff Flake’s will be done in watercolors.  Not surprising, his predicted “yes” confirmation vote is a disappointing Profile in Meekness.

Do the maths to see how much the nation makes on gross / net plus other deductions in 24hrs.

Una see or taste the money ?
6464 2018-10-05 17:19:46 It is everyday sexism. It’s also a little condescending to say something like that to anyone. I doubt that he has a full understanding of the chemical breakdown of the oil or how different viscosities are achieved.
6465 2018-10-05 17:19:39 Burn the midnight oil.
6466 2018-10-05 17:19:20 Generally the oil prices sky rocket during summer and by fall and winter their prices recede.. Hopefully that what everyone is expecting to recover.. 

But this time i doubt that.

6483 2018-10-05 17:17:41 Kay, the numbers mean something. first number tells u about viscosity at low temps (5W- motor oil flows better at lower temperatures than 15W- motor oil). The higher number (e.g. '40' in 10W-40) refers to how fluid your oil is at hot temperatures. So 'runny stuff' for winter, no?

6557 2018-10-05 17:10:19 Comrade, he has no role in deciding the base price of oil once prices r decontrolled. He can tweak taxes as he did just now. If he starts politics at the cost of fiscal discipline u will wail 24x7. Ignorance or misinformation? One thing yeh public hai sab jaanthi hai.
6558 2018-10-05 17:10:15 I’ve read/heard about fish oil and omegas increasing risk of prostrate cancer. Any thoughts on this?
6559 2018-10-05 17:10:06 Import oil and diversify to renewable energy. Worst case, ration electricity but NO to fracking.
6560 2018-10-05 17:10:06 We have the worlds largest oil reserves (depending on who you ask) and we import oil. No one has a substance to replace oil. It's a money grab (carbon tax) that is all . Have a good day
6561 2018-10-05 17:10:06   10 days ago, I warned you about OIL prices, and reminded you to fill up your tanks. The price of a barrel of oil today is $75.00 a barrel. 10 days ago it was $70.00. That's a $5.00 increase. The futures price is at $85.00.
Gas rices going way up. Inflation, inflation.
6562 2018-10-05 17:10:04 Yes on prop 127. Sun light free- oil not free. Sun light good for earth- oil bad for earth. We did need oil, that's gone, help earth not oil money, yes on prop 127.

6576 2018-10-05 17:09:10 Listen to us - Oil is set for a Super Crash - every punter is expecting Oil to rise. However President Trump will not allow this. He may even relax Iran Sanctions. So dont speculate
6577 2018-10-05 17:08:58 So what you are saying is that Democrats would vote for the next Trump Supreme Court nominee?  That sounds reasonable.

6582 2018-10-05 17:08:39 I hate getting a oil change just because they’re so willing to fuck up your day by telling you everything that’s wrong with your whip, like you came to fix everything at once...
6583 2018-10-05 17:08:37 I love when an oil change turns into a $300 maintenance bill 
6584 2018-10-05 17:08:37 (Cont.) A person after essential fatty acids, specifically omega 3, 6, and 9 (fish oil does not contain O-9), would fare better turning to plant-based oils like Sea Buckthorn oil, Black Currant oil, Borage oil, Hemp Seed oil, or Evening Primrose oil.

6589 2018-10-05 17:08:10 and specifically to your examples:
Trump: as per NYT, massive tax evasion
Koch: decades of oil subsidies
Walton: gaming the system by offloading social security costs on the community

OIL 1H pulls back below 20MA AGAIN, volatility back on full. WATCH
I'm going to trade and WATCH the rest of the day.
6595 2018-10-05 17:07:46 Why would you want to participate in that? I can think of hundreds of things I would rather do with my time. Scrubbing oil drops off the garage floor ranks higher on the list than gathering with weirdos to protest nonsense. And yeah, I am a liberal but part of the mass #DemExit.
6596 2018-10-05 17:07:41 Thanks Trump. With stagnant wages, rising interest rates and rising oil prices, the economy really isn’t much better. #VoteBlue2018 #BlueSnowStorm2018

6598 2018-10-05 17:07:38 Agreed, concern relates more to if u end up having to sell before maturity I guess. Also, there’s always default risk if things turn really ugly. Eg. The Enquest retail bond had to restructure when oil prices plunged.
6599 2018-10-05 17:07:31 @JustinTrudeau : on pollution, "there should be a price on pollution"...just one question, will that price be tied to the price of the oil were selling overseas?

6617 2018-10-05 17:05:30 India didn't impose an embargo on Iran. Besides, my argument is to pay for it in rupees for all of our oil trading partners. if post November sanctions, India continues to buy oil from Iran then the "On-Off" trade argument is null and void as we may only parly reduce oil imports
6618 2018-10-05 17:05:30  Well, she’s consuming them based on her free will. However, she may be ignorant to the fact that fish oil is pure waste byproduct of the fish industry. Fish oil is pressed from the liver (of dead fish), an organ that holds the most toxins in the body.

When planning to get an oil change, people always look for a cheaper option thinking it doesn’t make much difference.

6718 2018-10-07 23:56:03 When assessing the value of an asset, it's often helpful to take into account all the variables. In the case of Alberta's oil, it has a downside impact on exacerbating climate change. How do we factor that in, or do we just ignore and pretend it doesn't exist?

6739 2018-10-07 23:52:32 Oh, so what are you are going to do? Support higher taxes, maybe job killing regulations, and the Democrat Party assault on oil & natural gas drilling, and coal? We had that kind of hell from people who spent 8 years claiming to care WV and the region suffered.

6749 2018-10-07 23:50:47 Heat up a cast iron skillet over prolly like medium high heat. Use grape seed oil or something else w a high smoking point. Skin side down and cook it until it easily releases when you try to flip it. Like 4-5mins.
Cook on the other side about 3-4mins. I lower the heat to medium.
6750 2018-10-07 23:50:42 Would it burn too much because of the egg in the mayo? Or would the whole thing just act like oil? Interesting...

6763 2018-10-07 23:48:59 The tea tree oil face wash from Trader Joe’s works wonders for me. It uses plant fats instead of animal fats so it leaves your skin feeling squeaky clean. And glycolic acid is supposed to be pretty good too!
6764 2018-10-07 23:48:54 Yeah, I can change oil, & brakes, I just choose not to. I'd rather have someone else do it. But at least I know how to if I have to. I used to be able to change the alternator & starter too, but haven't done it for so long I wouldn't trust myself to do it now.
6765 2018-10-07 23:48:52 So this is what I’m planning so I can also stay within the cals of @Skinny4Xmas2018 breakfast feast: protein shake lunch preworkout and protein shake or bar or veggies in olive oil so I can get enough fat and that’s it because after school I work till 8:00 then sleep

1) someone poured too much oil and it over flowed when they dropped a basket of fries
2) they didn’t spin off the water from the fries and dropped like every basket. When the fries have water still it will make the oil rise
6779 2018-10-07 23:46:39 The woman consoling the crybaby is really a snake oil salesman, promising something that cant be delivered. Why do people on the left take advantage of other people on the left? Have they no scruples? Offering lies instead of solutions.

6794 2018-10-07 23:44:55 They had buds, so I got that instead of oil. But the oils were from 25mg to 2000mg I think & the 25mg was $25 if Im not mistaken. The price increased with the dosage. They sell ejuice, dog treats, lemonade, powder for food/smoothies, bath bombs, mouth spray, & dabs, too.

6798 2018-10-07 23:44:20 All Australians should benefit from the fact that oil, gas and other resources are available on and off shore. Logically, the final product would be cheaper and mean less revenues for the Government. Why can't State and Territory Governments not run petrol stations?

6804 2018-10-07 23:43:12 I like to play the top gainers and bottom bouncers and yes some are weed & BioPharma. I’m also looking at oil stocks too.
6805 2018-10-07 23:43:05 I love the smell and benefits of lavender oil
6806 2018-10-07 23:42:29 I think I’m the only person who still puts on baby oil when I get out of the bath. All year round tho lol idc the weather.
6807 2018-10-07 23:42:16 that picture w/ the coconut oil and dildo in the background is killing me bc I personally know who posted the shit.

6812 2018-10-07 23:41:21 I had neck pain last week causing really bad headaches and dizziness.

I decided to use CBD massage oil on my neck and shoulders and it worked. 

I pulled a calf muscle that week also while getting out of bed and the CBD massage oil worked also.

Hope you find some relief.
6813 2018-10-07 23:41:21 Slice one up, put a little salt and olive oil on it and try it then. It can be super bland for a few reasons, but mostly if it is used before/after its prime ripeness. When you hold it in your hand you should be able to push a little but it should still have firmness.
6814 2018-10-07 23:41:13 i completely skimmed over where you said work lol. well peppermint oil is supposed to be good at repelling fleas. i have cotton balls soaked w it in every room of my place. seems to work. maybe you can mix some in w lotion
6815 2018-10-07 23:41:05 I roasted my peppers, then packed in garlic olive oil, dehydrated cherry toms. I’m so sick of canning that I’m making savory tomato jam this week. You have a lot of work, girl!
6816 2018-10-07 23:40:41 Believe me when I say this, but we have hardly scratched the surface of spending all our “Arab oil money”

Imagine if we were actually allowed to spend our owners money. 
6817 2018-10-07 23:40:40 It's as if the only cuss word they know is "fuck." I worked in the oil patch for 5 years and believe me Darlin' there are do many many more.

Oy-gevalt your so boring. It's like you have this Soros fetish.  Based on what?  Nothing. Billionaires Mercers & Koch (plus big oil) support every right wing political entity alive.  

But ONE billionaire liberal Jew, and it's "World domination"
6825 2018-10-07 23:39:41 Kavanaugh had nothing to do with Parkland. I feel awful for Mr. Guttenberg but his blame is misplaced. he was let down by the FL political system, the Sheriff, and the school department.
6826 2018-10-07 23:39:01 Teaching used to be the only thing that makes me wanna wake up early in the morning and burn the midnight oil in the evening, but now I think my will to teach had slowly faded as the sun begins to rise and as the moon starts to shine.
6827 2018-10-07 23:38:58 This seems to be a plot by Qatar-Turkey-Iran regimes to sabotage the US-Saudi relations ahead of the #iranSanctions on #oil that Saudi promised to replace any amount of #Iran oil cutback by sanctions. It doesn't make sense at all for Saudis to kidnap from their own consulate
6828 2018-10-07 23:38:27 journalist being killed where he does business...now why the phuck is that Ronna...India buying weapons from Russia and oil from Iran..turkey buys weapons from Russia also...that isn't how things use to work..douchebag.
6829 2018-10-07 23:38:15 You May be a little naive there. The middle east has been making trillions from oil. That buys a lot of power, and influence. Personally, I believe even Soros is a puppet. What do you do with all that wealth? Invoke your beliefs, and way of life on the rest of the World.

6832 2018-10-07 23:38:02 Helped my step son do an oil change for the first time today.
6833 2018-10-07 23:37:52 I discovered how to make a perfect béchamel sauce by accident today.
Put 1.5 cup milk, .25 cup white flour, .25 c fat (butter:olive oil 3:1) in the Vitamix, raise speed slowly to 10, stay at 10 for 2:45, then transfer to microwave.
Nuke for 2:30 at 50%, stirring every 30 seconds.
6834 2018-10-07 23:37:48 Been getting horrible endo flares even at the fair. There’s a vendor selling cbd oil products and let us use the cbd lotion and eat their cbd honey sticks. Hoping this helps

6842 2018-10-07 23:36:45 My oil mixture I made have my locs flourishing and it smell SOOOO damn good
6843 2018-10-07 23:36:07 i spilled most of a bottle of sesame oil on the bed, dumped 16oz of tea on my blanket, and broke my mug. i was trying to go to bed early because i have a migraine and it's a bad pain day. i have no stuff for the bed that isn't either soaking wet or oil-covered.
6844 2018-10-07 23:36:06 i remember i use to always put on baby oil instead of lotions years ago but i hated when it was hot outside i’m glad i replaced that with using coconut oil ion have no regrets now lol
6845 2018-10-07 23:35:43 Not to mention the deal made with the Saudis. One of Trump's ideas. Selling them weapons. He thinks he's so smart? Wait until they use them against us. Bcuz of oil.
6846 2018-10-07 23:35:31 I didn't know such a thing was possible. Staying away from the cannabis oil as I need no further inducements to have midnight feasts.

6850 2018-10-07 23:34:35 I really want trash American food. I'm tired of this healthy Greek style foods with only salt, pepper, oregano and olive oil for seasonings.
6851 2018-10-07 23:34:25 $3.49 per gal Costco. Not at high as $3.69 at Shell in other areas. Hybrid is a good thing at 50+ mpg. Crude oil is rising.
6852 2018-10-07 23:34:23 Oh, they do. Wire transfers from America to Mexico just passed oil revenues to be their largest source of income. If we taxed those wire transfers we could pay for a bad ass wall. Quick.

6857 2018-10-07 23:33:47 @TMrealityczech When trees die and decay they do release CO2 but it can take centuries as much becomes soil humus. Eons ago some was buried deep and converted to coal/oil.gas. the only way to return that CO2 back into the system is consuming that fossil fuel
6858 2018-10-07 23:33:39 So after doing absolutely everything in your powers to make the country totally dependent on oil for transport, you've discovered that this creates economic harm when the $NZ price of oil rises. I guess better late than never...

6860 2018-10-07 23:33:26 My Texas aunt has a collection of cattle oil paintings that I will have to dig up for you.  Each is valued over six figures.
6861 2018-10-07 23:33:24 Excellent list. I add only add (though this falls into the bougie category I suppose) the fries at Fritland in Brussels still haunt my dreams. Twice fried, first in peanut oil, then in duck fat. Side of samurai sauce (sambel olek mayo). Legendary, especially for a few euro.
6862 2018-10-07 23:33:11 I got habanero seed oil in my eye once again, the fact I have to say again is concerning but we good the eye flush worked and dawn soap helps draw the oil off your hands. my idiocy is your gain friend these are the things they don't teach you in school
6863 2018-10-07 23:32:36 I am an essential oil room diffuser mixologist. People walk into my place and I’m all, “What you have in front of you today, chefs, is an aromatic medley of invigorating eucalyptus, a whisper of lavender, finished with a dazzling top note of bright Meyer lemon.” Whattup?
6864 2018-10-07 23:32:33 Awaiting your reply fam,  I've got until 1:00am..

6873 2018-10-07 23:30:48 Allowing the use of asbestos, raising the amount of allowed radiation, drilling for oil or fracking on public lands is wrong when there are so many other ways to power this country's needs. He's shown that what he cares about is corporate $ and favors, and it's terrible.

6878 2018-10-07 23:29:34 You would think so but actually cutting down trees and replanting uses more CO2 that leaving old forest. In alberta at least companies (both forestry and oil and gas are rewarded for replanting. Both industries are very responsible in that regard.
6879 2018-10-07 23:29:28 Just go in after with a cleanser. I never leave it as is . I use my purity face wash after . It’s meant to be . The oil is what removes it so effortlessly.
6880 2018-10-07 23:29:24 They put the cyclists for a major fundraiser for the primere forestry project in the city  supported by a massive corporation on active streets.

It's almost as if when you spend a century spooning with oil and gas you put auto interests first.

6888 2018-10-07 23:26:49 UK created KSA. They know exactly the true nature of those killers and used to pay theirs emirs to act against Ottomans. Now with oil things are inverted Saudia spending $$$ for lobbying and certain mercenaries journalists.
6889 2018-10-07 23:26:30 that is totally stupid.  did they reimburse companies for stealing the oil fields?  and how do you collect?  you turn it in for oil?  the new fiat - pretend it is backed by hard assets.  if they ask for the oil, throw them in jail.

6904 2018-10-07 23:23:19 Snake oil salesman is someone who knowingly sells fraudulent goods or who is himself or herself a fraud, quack, charlatan, and the like.  Have you noticed the YUGE number of people protesting in the streets of America doofus Donnie?
6905 2018-10-07 23:23:17 These Trump cult followers have been so duped by the snake oil salesman. I learned @ my daddy’s knee Republicans are for big biz, union busting, no social safety net & NEVER for the avg American. It’s proven true my entire life. Now they’re just corrupt AF

6927 2018-10-07 23:18:44 Interesting to note that Income Tax, VAT, Corporation Tax and Inheritance Tax all considered as Central Taxes. This would take back the 10% of VAT recently retained by @scotgov and I assume the Corporation Tax includes the RCT payable on the oil & gas industry.
6928 2018-10-07 23:18:36 This is an oil dictatorship so not sure average people loves 10.5$/gallon of gasoline.
6929 2018-10-07 23:18:29 I certainly hope so. I'm stocked up on food and ammo. I'm tired of being called "stupid" and "backwards" by assholes who can't even change the oil in their car. I maintain the automation systems at a manufacturing plant, and they think they are smarter than me. Fuck em.

7086 2018-10-07 22:57:07 I SAID WHAT I SAID it works. You can put some on your waves too. Make sure you add another good smelling oil because it’s potent.
7087 2018-10-07 22:56:47 Oil and water don’t mix.
7088 2018-10-07 22:56:22 Our biggest environmental problem is and has always been trash. What to do with it and make people pick up their trash. Most of it is plastic and can now be recycled back into usable fuels and lubricants(oil). Money for picking up your trash solves that problem immediately.
7089 2018-10-07 22:56:18 sorry, i feel sick just thinking about it. Like u dont even know if its hygienic or the amount of oil in them. I also can't eat fish and I'm much of a meat eater. I'm really picky.

7101 2018-10-07 22:52:58 Omg. I'm not even close to professional but maybe put some oil on it?

Like coconut oil or argan oil?

That's what I would try.

But ......not a professional.
7102 2018-10-07 22:52:56 I will be doing my show live in YouTube under timwparsons and on iTunes and Podbean.  I will be discussing the use land benefits of CBD oil. Call in 8152900912
7103 2018-10-07 22:52:38 Yes, though I'd call it a misunderstanding given that it is an oilseed crop. However, as I've said before, if you're avoiding soy bean meal in your diet it's equally important to avoid soy oil too.

7107 2018-10-07 22:52:12 Hey I don’t wanna be rude but I always see this shit on the flag kneeing that’s like “don’t disrespect our soldiers they fight for our freedom” no ones trying to take our freedom away, we’re in Afghanistan for oil, not cause we’re about to lose our freedom. Fucking stupid

America: IT AINT SALAD IF IT DONT HAVE MAYONNAISE
7112 2018-10-07 22:51:35 The smell of patchouli oil and garbage must have been blinding.
7113 2018-10-07 22:51:21 Apparently, Murkowski wants Alaska to be governed by the 9th Circuit which is anti oil and gas, 2nd amendment and other things detrimental to the Alaska economy. This would continue as long as the 4-4 tie on the Supreme Court. Surely, they can elect a real Republican for Senator.
7114 2018-10-07 22:50:48 We or America wouldn't get involved , no oil there .
7115 2018-10-07 22:50:23 Valid question but it could go many'a ways. All depends on your answer. Lol, just like Exxon discovering all that natural oil. Were yall w| us shooting in the gym or..?

7117 2018-10-07 22:49:55 Did you know, we knew how to control gravity back in the 50's? Did you know they didn't want you to know that, so they could control you through oil, gas, etc? Make you pay extra when hurricanes come through, just because they can, cuz " oil rigs can't produce during storms? "
7118 2018-10-07 22:49:44 #Herdbehavior represents the tendency for an individual to mimic the actions of a larger group, whether those actions are rational or irrational. Even those that have enough fuel want to buy more. Those with cooking oil want to buy boxes and it goes on............
7119 2018-10-07 22:49:14 Alright real question. What are the scores on the length of it for? Oil retention? Seems like it would add fracture points.

7121 2018-10-07 22:48:38 Have you tried CBD oil for your headaches?
7122 2018-10-07 22:48:37 What about the 5kg rice price talker behind the oil, could it be fake too in the same manager context view?
7123 2018-10-07 22:48:32 i put a ton of this "feel good" oil blend into my diffuser. please work
7124 2018-10-07 22:48:31 & dairy, limit that as much or all together, if possible & substitute your butters with olive oil.
7125 2018-10-07 22:48:19 My daddy always making sure I’m up to maintenance on my car texting me talking about” did you get a oil change this weekend & get your tire pressure checked “ yes damn 
7126 2018-10-07 22:48:15 Lol. Clinton would have done little good in these areas, either. She went into the election with at least 6 million from the oil companies in her back pocket. (That we know about). She was a fracking cheerleader. C'mon. The Dems need to be actual opposition.
7127 2018-10-07 22:48:08 meanwhile SAUDIS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 9/11 but that's just a detail...they want Iran's natural resources, oil and the big money from war. How dare that ignorant pig talk about anything..

7136 2018-10-07 22:46:39 Haklısın.

Şöyle deneyeyim: 1 trilyonluk Amazon'un siyasi gücü, Standard Oil'e veya "muz cumhuriyeti" kavramının mimarı UFC'ye, hele hele VOC'e kıyasla çok düşük. Çünkü ekonominin kalanı ve devlet büyük.

Yani Dünya bu konuda kötüye gitmiyor. O kadar kötüydü ki bu iyileşmiş hali.

7142 2018-10-07 22:45:26 Alberta really needs to get with a new economy. Fossil fuels are on the way out. The only purpose of the oil in Alberta is to sell it cheaply to the US and buy it back refined and expensive. That is a racket, not an economy.
7143 2018-10-07 22:45:03 Happy with much of this article actually. @MSYBessette correctly distinguishes between personal belongings & private property. Socialists aren’t coming for your @WillieNelson CDs anymore than @BetoORourke is likely to ban barbecue. But the oil fields are another matter entirely.

7150 2018-10-07 22:44:07 So. Those are called Fillers and they are describing a decades war. From precolonial and post colonial war. You did not get the preliminaries did you? This is about OIL.

7155 2018-10-07 22:43:18 15 of the 20 9/11 highjackers were Saudi. Bush permitted all Saudi royalty in the US to leave the US at a time when ALL airports and carriers were in lockdown mode. The Saudi's are not allies, they are Salafist  oil merchants.

7161 2018-10-07 22:42:40 Ok so i bought my first monster bottle of CBD oil yesterday. So that's helping.
7162 2018-10-07 22:42:38 Using body oil is all well and good until you’re stood dancing around your room because it won’t sink in
7163 2018-10-07 22:42:28 Passing tax breaks for coal, gas, and oil, I think... Yeah, I think that’s what America is doing. 
7164 2018-10-07 22:42:25 Specially with Saudi promise to replace the cut down of Iranian oil and days until the new sanctions, it was very urgent to them to figure out a plot to turn the US and other nations against Saudi Arabia and Erdogan justify his violations of sanctions and support for the MULLAHS
7165 2018-10-07 22:42:09 We now know better than to hope but actually judge by precedents.

He was coordinator of the economy when oil was $40 and the economy still grew. Has actually done business. 

Seems to me like he will know more than a tribalistic military cow herder with 2 recessions to his name.
7166 2018-10-07 22:42:05 This ability to create endless credit has allowed the switch to a supply economy to artificially create demand by globalised lower cost production, & has enabled a new financialised economy with a huge credit bubble, & a 2nd Gilded Age. For the Standard Oil Trusts, read Amazon.

7169 2018-10-07 22:41:46 Ahah! US never interferes! Saudi regime hundred times repressive than Iran, doing nothing to stop global Salafi fanatic funding, starving Yemenis. But Petro-dollars, buying of weapons,oil security, not publicity criticizing Israel- are being used to make US keep  mum.
7170 2018-10-07 22:41:37 The pandering to the oil industry (damage control for show, maybe?) Is a key area where I'm not on board with the provincial party.
7171 2018-10-07 22:41:31 Just dripped seal oil on one of my favorite shirts 
7172 2018-10-07 22:41:28 I thought this was a bottled Vegetable Oil....
7173 2018-10-07 22:41:28 I actually liked that the moderator and Ron turned it away from politics in America. I love the books and show and do not watch for the views about modern day issues. Not that we all don't have strong opinions, we do, but when half the Country feels each way, why divide.
7174 2018-10-07 22:41:20 #MATD
When Pmo discovered Mexico last year there share 250 million barrels  The mkt cap increased 100m on news.
And oil price was 50$ a barrel.

Matd targeting nearly double at 480 million barrels.
It's onshore which is a premium to offshore.

OIL NOW 85$

7185 2018-10-07 22:39:43 You're not answering my question about the route, but the plan wasn't to capture Hawaii, it was to cripple the US Pacific Fleet to allow Japan to seize territory in the Pacific unchecked after the US oil embargo. Correct me if I'm missing anything.
7186 2018-10-07 22:39:33 Many oil companies are looking to take part in a managed decline of their industry. You're right, that there's not much time left for that. The carbon bubble could burst next year, or 2021, or later.
I'm certain it will happen before 2030, perhaps as early as 2025.
7187 2018-10-07 22:39:06 *killing humans* Oh... this coming from my eye? No, I'm... I'm not crying. That's... it's an oil leak. Just oil. J-just oil....

7205 2018-10-07 22:34:57 this whole brazilian nonsense started because a wealthy dutch oil company were shoving bribes at a developing economy. (also US imperialism is also the fault of western europeans! if we’d not gone over there with our john locke bullshit...)
7206 2018-10-07 22:34:49 So i recently bought castor oil to put on my brows and eyelashes and the bottle says it is a beauty *hack* and has a nice *musk* but tbh 55% of the claims on castor oil says its fake news and it smells like peanut sauce from the thai restaurant sooooooo
7207 2018-10-07 22:34:34 Big Oil financed Pruitt to rollback regulations for drilling, fracking, pumping etc.  Big Oil made hefty contributions to most GOPs.  THIS can't end well. Our grandkids will suffer from their pollution - Climate Change &/or disease. #SaveDemocracy

7213 2018-10-07 22:33:45 Russia is a wall for Saudis as they can't take market manipulating production because Russian can sell oil cheaper and faster than Saudis can in the Chinese market. That's why they signed OPEC agreement: they burned out their reserves faster and more in deep they miscalculated.

7218 2018-10-07 22:32:34 That’s b/c oil fields affect the long-term survival prospects of billions of one’s fellow Earthlings. If you plucked a nuke in the state of nature, it’s absurd to claim it as private property, b/c its use would affect far more than just you & should be subject to a vote at least.
7219 2018-10-07 22:32:32 Remember when @TheDemocrats said we can't get into a trade war with China?

Well.. They dropped the 25% tariff on oil so....

#VoteDemOut and #MAGA
7220 2018-10-07 22:32:26 Ever wonder WHY China's army of 200,000,000 would march to the MIDDLE EAST in these last days?

NO OIL OF THEIR OWN! 
7221 2018-10-07 22:32:22 Better than bringing the poison ivy oil (and mud) into the house!
7222 2018-10-07 22:32:21 Ah. xD

Maybe the next morning you'll be able to try this out? Cause It's delicious. Just need to heat it up with some cooking oil before adding the ingredients.
7223 2018-10-07 22:32:06 Secondus, your Looters Party (PDP) that was in power for 16yrs with  revenue from sales of Oil above $650billion within the period with nothing on the ground to show for it, asking to be allowed to come back to power, just 4yrs after, is an insult to our collective intelligent.
7224 2018-10-07 22:32:02 Where is the baby oil going tho ... cuz I ain’t EVER needed anything extra 
7225 2018-10-07 22:31:58 Article 32.10 in the new NAFTA has to be ratified by all 3 governments.  That's the article that cuts China out of trade deals with Canada & Mexico.  Curious to see when it will be ratified.  Another thing, like to verify if true that China stopped buying US oil in Aug.?
7226 2018-10-07 22:31:45 Mr. Integrity Versus Mr. Corruption

7228 2018-10-07 22:31:10 ain’t no oil gone save me
7229 2018-10-07 22:31:08 Fuel for cars is now plenty - but cooking oil price has shot up. The government must allow us to import ours so that the store keepers keep theirs
7230 2018-10-07 22:31:07 We need to get you some infinity money... let's go digging for oil and stuff!
7231 2018-10-07 22:30:57 Saudis fly airplanes into buildings and they’re our buddies. Oil rules Republicans.
7232 2018-10-07 22:30:52 They also lie about venezuela having a crisis supposedly due to socialist policies even though these problems emerged after us sanctions and the fall of oil prices.

7247 2018-10-07 22:28:19 retinol suspended in oil tend to be a little gentler (Jordan Samuel has one, pestle & mortar has one I think). Alternatively try decreasing how often you use a retinol (also make sure you’re wearing sunscreen the day after application)
7248 2018-10-07 22:27:45 No essential oil or plant is going to protect your child from polio & other God awful diseases... VACCINATE YOUR CHILDREN. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.

7250 2018-10-07 22:27:11 Once u bleach it make sure you’re constantly putting hair treatments in and use coconut oil infused conditioner!! No sulfate shampoo/conditioner!!
7251 2018-10-07 22:27:07 As petrol prices increase this is a great time to accelerate the transition away from oil dependency in our transport system - we can cut our climate emissions and save ourselves $5 billion a year on imported fuel by getting off oil for transport energy. #MakeOilHistory

7256 2018-10-07 22:25:55 Diesel fuel in Tallahassee Florida, is at $3.70 a gallon for our truckers. Of course we are passed on that excessive price and our good. Why can’t we address this lunacy. I thought we were great oil producers.

7265 2018-10-07 22:23:38 seriously, the longer we pussy-foot around all these activists who are blocking the Pipelines we are going to be held hostage by those no-good f'ing arrogant Americans robbing us blind of our oil. We need to get the oil flowing East or West to get it access to other world markets
7266 2018-10-07 22:23:13 CBD oil. It's cannabis based but without the stoned element. x

7269 2018-10-07 22:22:28 Thanks for sharing this - it never ceases to amaze me how many people seem to think that 80% of soy beans are grown to feed to livestock, as if the other 20% just prduce oil.
7270 2018-10-07 22:22:22 Sure. It’s fine. Just admire Oil & Gas stuffs
7271 2018-10-07 22:22:19 Oil RIG
7272 2018-10-07 22:21:55 A hit job . A hatchet job . A absolute disgraceful bias interview . Which is to be expected from One of Denis O Brian’s pets . 

You will be massaging Higgins balls with the finest holistic massage oil  when you interview him I bet .
7273 2018-10-07 22:21:54 So while, "yes, they're more affordable" in the sense that you could buy a used for only around 60k.... taking it out to dessert w/ the girlfriend in Hollywood/etc like we might do occasionally would result in a leaky oil seal. And $1300 in repair costs.

Vegetarian means that you only don’t eat meat.
7277 2018-10-07 22:20:53 World oil demand continues to grow, rendering a Canadian carbon tax meaningless.

There ARE positive actions such as:
- consumption standards on all ICE, not just autos
- nuclear (preferably thorium) to power the oilfield
- serious incentives for CCS, etc.

But not taxation.
7278 2018-10-07 22:20:41 someone on my ig just claimed that chemotherapy is big pharma corruption and that the correct alternative is cbd oil im fuckin done with this bitch

Flat land for growing (think Scottish lowlands). 
Mineral rich land. 
Oil fields.   
Wrap it up in Kings and queens, religion or race, but it always comes back to 'you got what we want'.  
It's always the working poor that pay

7299 2018-10-07 22:17:55 Ugh I use coconut oil for eeeeeeverything 
7300 2018-10-07 22:17:50 There is no other revenue states get apart from oil and they are shared by amount of lga. Advising that we shouldn't be concerned about that is wrong until this feeding bottle system stops.
7301 2018-10-07 22:17:27 ran out of olive oil and tried roasting my veggies without it and i literally shrunk them and dried them all out LMAO yummy sunday dinner!

7310 2018-10-07 22:16:40 George Soros and Vladimir Potanin placed a massive bet on Russian telecom that left Soros out ~$900M and the Kremlin dealing with crashing rubles.

7311 2018-10-07 22:16:26 What’s sad, it’s not about people - it’s about money. Corporate oil money. They hold the power in Texas. They don’t want to pay their fair share of taxes. 
@BarackObama I hope you will help Beto because he is worthy of becoming the new Senator of Texas. Please and Thanks.
7312 2018-10-07 22:16:21 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, but – and who we are fighting for.

From realism and abstract art even graffiti with paints, lead, ink and oil pastels. Now days I'm trying my hand at something more digital or graphic art
7344 2018-10-07 22:10:48 Yes, but leaving coal to go with oil advanced things, there was much more power in that refined petroleum. EV's is moving backwards, and swapping to parallel (both bad). What about the diseconomy of ditching 100 years of oil and gas?Think about the financial losses and unemployed

7356 2018-10-07 22:09:03 #NowPlaying @ 18:08:50 ET: "Power And The Passion" by Midnight Oil from "10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1" (1982)
7357 2018-10-07 22:08:52 Try rice bran oil
7358 2018-10-07 22:08:47 there is coconut oil in my eyes mmm my eyeballs will feel silky and smooth now
7359 2018-10-07 22:07:27 fellas, you're eating oil of every pearls un-insides, hannah diamond walks in a can of qt, you turn around and see gfoty she tells you she's walking down the street in her brand new car what do you do?
7360 2018-10-07 22:07:27 Venezuela isolated itself from the world oil market. 
In the last 18 years the Chavez/Maduro regime took one of the largest state oil companies on earth and virtually looted it into shambles. Production has fallen to less than half of what they used to produce in 1998.
7361 2018-10-07 22:07:23 They used to have boiling oil that could be poured on the peasants. It was to keep the peasants out of churches and castles;very effective. I think we should bring that back.
7362 2018-10-07 22:07:16 Kagising ko, ang oil nang mukha ko
7363 2018-10-07 22:06:54 Cory Booker comes on in his speeches amazingly and precisely like a Snake Oil Salesmen.  I know that is probably not fair- but he keeps trying to sell the audience those little bottles after his speech -would make anyone suspicious.
7364 2018-10-07 22:06:52 I just bought a cool new Poo-Chi robot dog!  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
7365 2018-10-07 22:06:26 Yes! Just did my weekly bath with lavender oil, coconut bath boom, Espeon salt. Cleaned my face with wick hazel and topped my skin off with shea butter
7366 2018-10-07 22:06:21 Time to switch industries - I hear the oil and gas / pipeline industry in Canada is the future. Oh wait, in Canada it seems no industry is the only thing acceptable .
7367 2018-10-07 22:06:18 this cheesesteak from my job is oil neff
7368 2018-10-07 22:06:05 Try freezing them. Or try cod liver oil liquid/straight off the spoon.
7369 2018-10-07 22:06:03 Maybe the Province should lead the bloody way rather than fiddling around with obsolete technology like oil and gas.
7370 2018-10-07 22:05:42 Slide some oil to me #thewiz
7371 2018-10-07 22:05:10 Oil pattern?
7372 2018-10-07 22:04:56 That's excellent
7373 2018-10-07 22:04:49 I went raw for 6 days girls...wooh its hard! Im trying for a more of whole food/ oil free diet
7374 2018-10-07 22:04:40 Oil money is a cancer
7375 2018-10-07 22:04:38 He was put on the court because his history as a judge is to always side with corporations against employees, consumers, the government, and the environment.  If there’s a case about a Corp. objecting to a ban on palm oil, he’ll side with the Corp..
7376 2018-10-07 22:04:30 Alhamdulillah
7377 2018-10-07 22:04:30 Try the tenderstem variety, or " stick broccoli", as I call it. Less kerfuffle to cook. Only steam slightly, a dash of butter or oil, yummer than it sounds.
7378 2018-10-07 22:04:21 Big kudos to @NHRAAllAccess for staying on for the Lucas Oil competitors!
7379 2018-10-07 22:03:59 Just so you guys know, in September the USA became #1 producer of oil.
7380 2018-10-07 22:03:42 Does anyone remember the ties to the oil industry the Bushes have?
7381 2018-10-07 22:03:30 Imagine how many of our tax $$ were wasted on countless staff hours trying to find ANYthing in history to justify what he did. Came up with nada, burn midnight oil to find a message that SOUNDS like there was. What’s ‘middle of a presidential election?’ Not 10 months out
7382 2018-10-07 22:03:16 Me: “wanna go get oil changes”
Friend: “not really”
Me: “I’ve been saying that for the last 400 miles”
7383 2018-10-07 22:02:58 Because Saudi's have oil.

Kushner/Trump are BOTH beholden $$$

AND...Khashoggi is/was PRESS so Trump couldn't care less.
7384 2018-10-07 22:02:53 Isn't it sad that my car didn't have any oil in it 
7385 2018-10-07 22:02:51 2 max strength cod liver oil capsules. Works every time. & I have no idea why

7390 2018-10-07 22:02:00 The problem he couldn't solve during the oil boom era until now ?
7391 2018-10-07 22:01:54 Left my dad my car and changed my oil & brakes, new window tint and filled up my gas tank.

7395 2018-10-07 22:01:09 You will waste your time on climate if we become the banana republic all you Dems r moving us to. We won’t have oil or anything to eat   China will. So we can work for them
7396 2018-10-07 22:00:55 Does that make olive oil food's eau de toilette?
7397 2018-10-07 22:00:54 today is my self care day except i dont have any facemasks or coconut oil for my ashy ass & i dont want to walk to Ala Moana or spend money but i wanna work out but i dont but i do but i dont
7398 2018-10-07 22:00:37  yeah alright. Try reading the geological reports that show there is no oil then come back. Wrong type of rock I believe.

7402 2018-10-07 22:00:19 It’s temporary. All signs are pointing toward recession. Continually increasing oil prices, increasing interest rates, increased commodity costs due to tariffs. There r 100s of tiny increases that will wipe out the eco gain the middle and poor got. Keep eye on participation rates
7403 2018-10-07 22:00:18 Busy till 2021 w Aramco family emergency APEX OIL save me a DVD @ElRoyaleMovie
7404 2018-10-07 22:00:15 Are you a member of the @IainGrey how do you get an Oil Fund mob ?
7405 2018-10-07 22:00:08 Lots of people are mad as hell, but still in minority. Too politically correctness

But Listen and follow to #Orban #Hungary and @matteosalvinim in #Italy
They are the Heros that fight against #Soros, #EU and the consequences of the#ResolutionofStrassburg (Oil for immigration)
7406 2018-10-07 21:59:52 I'm also a huge fan of KoFC! These are super simple, the primary flavors are salt and chicken. Each piece was super juicy and had a good amount of coating. Like each bite had a glisten of oil. Also I had gizzard which is so good fried.
7407 2018-10-07 21:59:27 It's more of a middle to upper class thing but yeah still snake oil
7408 2018-10-07 21:59:13 Existing oil wells are allowed to continue and be maintained.   “The measure bans any new petroleum extraction but permits as a “nonconforming use” any petroleum extraction existing on the effective date of the measure"
7409 2018-10-07 21:59:05 How is it we will kneel at the feet of a man for oil  when we have not first knelt at the feet of Jesus
7410 2018-10-07 21:59:01 To any dad that needs to hear this from a daughter: 

Yes, i got my oil changed.
7411 2018-10-07 21:59:00 I don’t know, but it only runs on Russian oil.
7412 2018-10-07 21:58:27 I'm a progressive who likes to get things done. And by "things," I mean oil wars.
7413 2018-10-07 21:58:13 the resolution on these makes them look like oil paintings
7414 2018-10-07 21:57:53 The oil had me in another dimension last night.
7415 2018-10-07 21:57:47 Just want a bish that fuqqz with my essential oil collection
7416 2018-10-07 21:57:41 Do they still have oil?
7417 2018-10-07 21:57:30 ขอโทษเรานั่งรถรับส่ง..... //หยอก5555
7418 2018-10-07 21:57:28 @davidwebbshow last week on highways 82 New Mexico and highway 83 Texas oil fields side to side for miles yet there were very very few wells pumping!
Why? Are they not pumping
7419 2018-10-07 21:57:23 Not as good as the Derek Lewis post fight interview when he said Trump called him before the fight:
(Sorry...am in a spot where have limited 'net and can't pull up) 
'Why'd you take your pants of?'
'Cuz my balls was hot' is how it starts!! 
7420 2018-10-07 21:57:23 Bought 2 of every flavor lip oil from @ultabeauty.  Thanks a lot @_kaicealea 
7421 2018-10-07 21:57:22 My brother always used to say his skin is bomb because of coconut oil and I’d just  cuz he’s conceited af... kumbe he was on to something.
7422 2018-10-07 21:57:20 Many of us are from the prairies and some have family working oil and gas but wisdom does kick in folks
7423 2018-10-07 21:56:56 Are you at the fish oil factory today or what?
7424 2018-10-07 21:56:23 Apparently one can eat anything if it is batter fried, and not necessarily in good oil.  Including batter fried sticks of butter.
7425 2018-10-07 21:56:11 Don't you have oil? Isn't it supposed to be your ticket to ultra richness 
7426 2018-10-07 21:55:54 amana price ye cooking oil mu zim haina kumira bho.....magarine to the rescue
7427 2018-10-07 21:55:34 I'm horrified I let this thot hit my oil pen. Bitch was probably sucking dick earlier
7428 2018-10-07 21:55:34 @realDonaldTrump their weapons are forty years ago and they are very weak. Your political situation is dangerous and you may miss everything. Iran's oil work should end on November 4th, if you give it a big betrayal to Iran's free-lance and never give it away.
7429 2018-10-07 21:55:26 おああああああああああああああああ！！！！！！
7430 2018-10-07 21:55:18 Atiku has been a billionaire since the late 80s
He and his business partners currently own one of the most productive assets in oil and gas in Nigeria.

Atiku is rich, he doesn't need to steal to get richer, neither would he apologize for being rich.
7431 2018-10-07 21:55:09 @realDonaldTrump They said that by canceling the war agreement, but nothing happened, Iran's oil would be completely cut off, they did not dare to do anything, we live in Iran and we know the regime. They are falling, and they say a lot about these words
7432 2018-10-07 21:55:08 Lol when u test out the coconut oil your using to make edibles and its way stronger than expected
7433 2018-10-07 21:55:06 仕事中だよ！！！
7434 2018-10-07 21:55:05 فسيكفيكهم الله وهو السميع العليم اللهم ياحي ياقيوم اكفنا شر من يريد ببلادنا الشر واجعل تدميرهم في تدبيرهم ورد كيدهم في نحورهم وسلط عليهم من قوتك ماتحمانا منهم ومن شرهم يارب العرش الكريم
7435 2018-10-07 21:54:55 Yes and no. AB has a huge income effect associated with oil and gas prices. The question is whether fuel consumption is down relative to what otherwise would have been the case here. Prove it didn't, and you'll have a great econ paper proving demand curves slope upward.
7436 2018-10-07 21:54:41 @realDonaldTrump That some people say it is fought with a full boycott of Iran's oil is a lie, war will never happen. The Iranian regime does not dare to engage with the United States,when Obama also spoke and did nothing, their speeches are empty and they just want to scare you
7437 2018-10-07 21:54:38 If water is exercise, oil is certainly October
7438 2018-10-07 21:54:29 All this trash you put out is directly used as a basis for sanctions and sabotage. That is your aim no? Justify the starvation of VZ through sanctions and blame maduro so the far right can take over and sell oil rights off to the US.

7440 2018-10-07 21:54:18 Any solutions for an epic oil hangover?  #Autobarn888 #VASC #BATHURSTWINNER 
7441 2018-10-07 21:54:14 Brain oil is the new biofuel sensation.
7442 2018-10-07 21:53:38 And the new oil fields are west of the northern isles.
7443 2018-10-07 21:53:32 Brit, you think our President is disgraceful? Well this Senator from Alaska will benefit greatly from oil drilling and jobs for her state! She may need Trump support more than he needs hers! Sorry she voted against a good man who was vilified and left to the vultures

7447 2018-10-07 21:53:17 Could whoever is drilling into my frontal lobe please stop? It's annoying, and you won't find any oil...
7448 2018-10-07 21:53:11 I apologize, the Permian Basin will Soon be the World’s largest oil producer... my bad. It’s the Fastest Growing Producer!
7449 2018-10-07 21:53:03 5 things we are watching in markets this week:
1- #Chineese market open
2- #USD/#CNY
3- US 10Y #yieldswillrise 
4- #inflation numbers on Thursday (on core we are slightly below market forecast).
5- #Oil (we looking for $3 dollar drop this week)
7450 2018-10-07 21:52:21 I hear of so many woman destroying they car b/c they’ve went like 11 months with no oil change lol
7451 2018-10-07 21:52:16 #Colorado the oil & gas industry wants you to believe initiative #112 will destroy jobs, hurt education, & explode the world.  NOPE.  Nothing changes EXCEPT they cannot drill/frack within 2,500 Ft of vulnerable place (schools, biz, homes).   #VoteYES112
7452 2018-10-07 21:52:14 Interested in petroleum? Why don't you message Ajala? The way he is going down.....he will soon discover oil.
7453 2018-10-07 21:52:07 KM already exports from 'tidewater' and more pointedly, it's not 'oil', it's diluted bitumen.
7454 2018-10-07 21:52:03 U won make dem arrest am, u wicked oo, but jokes apart,@atiku is corrupt n d international body will distance demselve from Nigeria, cos 80% of wat we have came from them, like if dey stop buying our crude oil , we don cast bdat oo, what do we even produces that can satisfies us
7455 2018-10-07 21:51:43 never trust a woman who doesnt oil her body down after taking a bath/shower.
7456 2018-10-07 21:51:41 China's not exactly building fuel oil power plants.
7457 2018-10-07 21:51:38 Yet, high oil and interest rates are taking every penny.
7458 2018-10-07 21:51:31 Oh spare me. It's not the partisan rage. It's the GOP partisan corruption. It's you oil company whores who takes money from corporations and turn your back on your constituents. Go back to Canada Rafael we want #BetoForTexas
7459 2018-10-07 21:51:26 Perhaps a good time for reminder. 

When the commodity crash happened @JustinTrudeau delivered $1.5 Billlion in special, immediate EI supports to help oil, gas and mining workers - and those in their communities - get back on their feet.

@AndrewScheer & @CPC_HQ voted no.
7460 2018-10-07 21:51:12 I feel like it’s a fathers job to make sure his daughter is well informed about her car care such as oil changes etc... lol

7465 2018-10-07 21:50:37 Today I did the math and realized I’m responsible for $70,000 worth of oil per day and now I just stress and hope that nothing goes wrong every minute at work

7474 2018-10-07 21:48:56 I agree and I think people underestimate the power of the snake oil pushed by the illegal leave spending (advertising) over the last few weeks of the referendum compaign
Why is advertising a huge industry?
It can sell rubbish for a while
7475 2018-10-07 21:48:23 “Does Doug Pederson need to rub one out with coconut oil at halftime to get things going? 610...”
7476 2018-10-07 21:47:51 Make your own wipes! There are so many bad chemicals in those things and its all getting into your baby’s system. I use a cup of water, tablespoon of coconut oil, and tablespoon of Castile soap. Then I just cut up paper towels. All natural and much cheaper than buying them
7477 2018-10-07 21:47:39 Like Ariel died from an oil leakage and turned into a zombie from it
7478 2018-10-07 21:47:22 During our Aluta days in school, were quick to convince ladies, cos if she promise to vote fr you, then you have that vote, they're very loyal.
7479 2018-10-07 21:47:19 Health Tips: keep your omega 3 oils(incl. fish oils)  in the freezer to keep fresh and reduce the fish oil repeating on you.
7480 2018-10-07 21:47:19 Can you do a zombie oil spill Ariel too
7481 2018-10-07 21:47:15 Went two weeks w/o my car for deer damage, now up to 4 days to get an OIL CHANGE!!! I’d like to have my Jeep more to myself than in the garage...
7482 2018-10-07 21:47:05 #Oil Senex $SXY.AX $SXY  Downgraded to Underweight at JPMorgan; PT A$0.47
7483 2018-10-07 21:46:49 Get rid of? The dollar is the only currency that goes hand in hand with oil. Economists do not know what happened, nobody, moreover, nobody knows what is going to happen within the next five minutes.
7484 2018-10-07 21:46:46 Cooking Oil evokes so much emotion.
7485 2018-10-07 21:46:14 OILさんと久しぶりに絡んだ気がする
7486 2018-10-07 21:46:06 You have to pour some oil into the pan (just enough to cover the bottom) and heat it.  You can use any oil for this but vegetable oil (I know) works best.  People used to use lard.  It has to be really hot for the pudding to rise.
7487 2018-10-07 21:46:06 Had my Dad help me replace an O2 sensor in my car, he made it look too easy
then we find out there's an oil leak now
I love cars :^)
7488 2018-10-07 21:46:02 I did, he was homophobic and then it happens lol.
7489 2018-10-07 21:45:52 Actually, I was considering vats of boiling oil, but that would have been too messy.  Just high-pressure water cannon should do it.  And put indelible purple dye in it.   It will make them easier to find later and arrest.
7490 2018-10-07 21:45:49 Popeye was disappointed with olive oil
7491 2018-10-07 21:45:47 Quality players. No competition . No fan base.  Little money (apart from oil money pumped Psg though) Poor TV coverage.
7492 2018-10-07 21:45:01 An Incel's salad dressing of choice? Extra virgin olive oil.
7493 2018-10-07 21:44:53 No. I saw my own "Brett" who also got away with it. Selling Trump's snake oil is her job. Listening to her pitch is a choice - and not mine. I don't fear for the men in my life. After the vote and the comments, I fear a LOT for the women, though. Once I was silent; now I VOTE.
7494 2018-10-07 21:44:32 DEADASS I WAS YELLIN AND YALL JUST KEPT TALKIN TO ME LIKE NOTHIN WAS HAPPENING AND THEN WE DECIDED WATER AND BURNING OIL WOULD WORK
7495 2018-10-07 21:44:27 Stopped by dads and he 
-rainx my windshield 
-checked my oil 
-checked my air pressure 
-cleaned the inside of my wind shield and dash
-polished my head lights 

Love my old man 
7496 2018-10-07 21:44:19 I would like to rub oil
7497 2018-10-07 21:44:10 I'm not sure this stacks up.
The vast bulk of the destruction of industry occurred under the Tories who had massively curbed union power.
Inflation wasn't high in the 60s + in the 70s was driven by several factors including the OPEC oil shock and the end of Bretton Woods.
7498 2018-10-07 21:44:07 In Portugal, celebrating one of the those milestones birthdays, and freakin’ tRump and the Supreme Court assaulter are ruining my trip. I hate their friggin’ guts. Bunch of JAGOFFS....you too, oil Lindsay
7499 2018-10-07 21:44:02 Oil and water?? Sorry too dense to get your drift. Can you clarify???
7500 2018-10-07 21:44:00 I have been wondering about how much that present is worth. When Feinstein had you pinned against the wall. I have it figured it out.ANWR oil fields.
7501 2018-10-07 21:43:40 When your diesel is tuned and running correctly, this is what the oil will look like after 3500ks...
7502 2018-10-07 21:43:17 i wonder if jimin smells like cherry or monoi oil
7503 2018-10-07 21:43:16 oh sweet smell of olbas oil how ive missed you
7504 2018-10-07 21:43:15 Olive Oil legs.
7505 2018-10-07 21:43:12 foundation, bronzer, liner,mascara and a little olive oil for that dewy look
7506 2018-10-07 21:43:08 Not sure why a company would specify a plant room with 300kw of oil boilers when the same company do heatloss and hot water requirements calcs at approx 130kw and that’s with 20% allowance at -4deg. @BeyondtheStove any ideas?
7507 2018-10-07 21:43:03 Wow! Just look at all of the "likes" and "retweets" surely getting more ruthless is a wonderful idea and will make us vote blue! LMFAO and if you believe that, I have a some snake oil that will make you live forever!
7508 2018-10-07 21:43:03 Can’t bother to look to see if he’s draft eligible but sure we should trust your expertise.  Bravo
7509 2018-10-07 21:42:48 Shit, blood, oil or a nice balanced mixture?
7510 2018-10-07 21:42:39 @Naissanceuk Hi :) have you stopped selling Menthol Liquid Essential Oil?  I can't seem to find it on your website.
7511 2018-10-07 21:42:36 Pure coconut oil is good for moisture after you cleanse. It gives you a glow also.
7512 2018-10-07 21:42:20 food with flavor
ftr i enjoy memes like chicken and waffles and pot roast benedictine and in england specifically i quite like brown sauce
but man, i just need to taste something that isn’t just oil
7513 2018-10-07 21:42:03 "the modern rogue prospects oil"
7514 2018-10-07 21:41:46 This gets that baby oil or hot water in your face out put it in the microwave about 90 seconds.  Wanna play
7515 2018-10-07 21:41:37 #AANLM. 4.2 GDP, 31% market growth; historical low unempl women & minorities; return of our industries; etc. Just fixing NAFTA is a major win. Our dairy farmers suffered under 300% tariffs. And think about how this helps the American auto industry. Coal is back. Oil is back. etc.
7516 2018-10-07 21:41:36 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
7517 2018-10-07 21:41:35 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
7518 2018-10-07 21:40:55 @BBCNews says new Climate Report will be "Highly controversial". Really? Do 97% of scientists contest it? Please stick to facts. Rather it is "highly opposed" by powerful interests like Big Oil and Trump. #environment #ipcc #climatechange
7519 2018-10-07 21:40:51 Not being rude but it is usually the finger most used. Pressing buttons, using a mouse, Tweeting etc. Try to train yourself to use a different finger to keep it going longer. Joint Oil by Totally Natural Skincare, based in Whitby is great btw.
7520 2018-10-07 21:40:50 Zimbabwe
Go and borrow oil basins from your neighbors. It’s about time. 
He’s about to do His mighty work.
7521 2018-10-07 21:40:37 I just used a 3-2-1 method that I saw on YouTube. Sit them at room temp, use oil as binder & sprinkle your rub. Smoke in smoker at 250 for 2 hrs, glaze with apple juice & honey & wrap in foil. Back on for 2 hrs, then unwrap & baste for last hour. Fall off the bone delicious.
7522 2018-10-07 21:40:33 If oil wasn't denominated in USD, the USD would be about 25%of its present value.
7523 2018-10-07 21:40:30 You need to set yourself up to run 2020. Alaska needs you. You were great once in Alaska so do your thing and straighten things up there not to mention, ya might want to speak to Trump about running his oil and gas Cabinet for America. Your very qualified for that position.
7524 2018-10-07 21:40:26 ポニテだし赤髪だし…w
7525 2018-10-07 21:40:24 Seriously?
7526 2018-10-07 21:40:19 They’re so bizarre. “EXCLUSIVE: Nutella is sugar and palm oil! Still want some?” Well, yes. Cheers.

7529 2018-10-07 21:39:51 UAE backed STC leadership called their forces in Shabwa to be on high alert after  reports of military forces  mobilisation  from Marib to Shabwa. This tension comes after STC forces announced their control of oil terminal in Shabwa. #Yemen
7530 2018-10-07 21:39:49 I had no idea cotton was made from oil.
7531 2018-10-07 21:39:38 Pan fry, slowly, gently, season fish, cold pan, Heat gently, little rapeseed oil, 15-20 minutes
7532 2018-10-07 21:39:23 I’m sure naysayers said a similar thing about switching from coal steam engines to  petrol internal combustion. “How can we refine all that oil when coal is ready and plentiful?” It’s just another revolution to embrace. We can’t rely on carbon fuels for transport anymore.
7533 2018-10-07 21:39:18 Sorry to tell you that Britain is helping to breed and sponsore terrorists example is,  president Buhari of Nigeria is being sponsored by Britain to kill innocent Biafrans & Nigerians  because of oil
7534 2018-10-07 21:39:16 Coconut oil is alright

7540 2018-10-07 21:38:21 In a filling station.. Fuel, kerosene, gas and oil are been sold there.... Which one come be fueling station? 
Unless the fueling station you are talking about is NIGERIA black market where only fuel are been sold
7541 2018-10-07 21:38:18 He’s quite ....touchy isn’t he? Interestingly I see his pinned tweet is a snake oil sales pitch...
7542 2018-10-07 21:38:16 But with Brian we now know what he did, amongst other things he used Eskom money or guarantee to buy a mine for the guptas. Im still waiting to hear what nene did except his sons oil transaction in moz

7545 2018-10-07 21:37:23 Depends what kind of 1st shot we are talking about. When they let a guy walk off the boards, untouched, and pick his spot, for me, that's not on the goalie. It did happen far too much last year but that wasn't just on Talbot. Gotta be better in their own end.
7546 2018-10-07 21:37:15 Them say Oga kelvin na gay
7547 2018-10-07 21:37:09 Finally home!!! Almost drenched but thank God for my guy  nah to suffer this cold alone remain. I need to oil ASAP... I’m becoming rusty 
7548 2018-10-07 21:37:07 No oil, no red tide, no toxic algae. 
Blue wave, not red tide.
7549 2018-10-07 21:36:26 気持ちよすぎて奥まで突っ込みそうになっておっと、ってなる
7550 2018-10-07 21:36:23 Gold diggers are gonna keep digging until they find oil
7551 2018-10-07 21:36:07 You got the wrong guys. Typical
7552 2018-10-07 21:35:56 Joel ...

What are coal and oil made from?

Dinosaurs: myth or fact?

Earth: how long did it take to ‘make’?
7553 2018-10-07 21:35:56 In a serious ass conversation this bitch said her skin is so dry that it’s producing so much oil... wait what..?
7554 2018-10-07 21:35:52 Saudi Arabia has been committing genocide & other crimes against humanity in Yemen, and throughout the Middle East — FUNDED BY AMERICAN ARMS & DOLLARS.

Did America fund & arm Hitler when he murdered millions of Jewish people during the Holocaust?

OIL IS NOT WORTH OUR HUMANITY!
7555 2018-10-07 21:35:52 “Most Americans” is incorrect “a few” would be better
7556 2018-10-07 21:35:37 Found some fantastic pico de gallo at the grocery store which has led to making tacos with everything. Beef, chicken, fish. Tonights fish tacos were pan fried in oil, butter, and parmesan cheese. Then drizzled with sriracha.
7557 2018-10-07 21:35:27 If you want to make it extra tasty, brown a minced garlic wedge (or a slice of onion) in some olive oil and then add the tomato sauce. It’s how my grandma does it and it’s delicious 
7558 2018-10-07 21:35:26 1. Lawn mowing (twice). 2. Landscaper for an inner city realty company. 3. Ride operator at an amusement park. 4. Pumped gas till the oil embargo took my job. 5. Toys R Us salesman (sold a bike to my physics prof). 6. Copied Army orders at Ft. Meade.  7. Doctor. #Thankful
7559 2018-10-07 21:35:20 No they haven’t . You’re straight up lying now, mr snake oil
7560 2018-10-07 21:35:15 yeee I learned how to change my own car’s oil and air filter 
7561 2018-10-07 21:35:04 why is she really there? oil? natural resources?
7562 2018-10-07 21:34:51 Vera Files hindi nyo ba i-fact check si Leni for saying na "All of the countries here in Asia import oil." ? Or hindi kasama sa utos ni Uncle Sam yan? lol
7563 2018-10-07 21:34:36 My dad lives off that road and it’s awful. I busted the oil pan in my Altima on that highway. And it’s close to the county line so I feel like they argue who’s responsible for it.
7564 2018-10-07 21:34:30 Worth trying Lidl or Aldi, some of their stores sometimes stock Central & Eastern European food products. 
The Italian ones are usually finished in oil after they'd been quick pickled.
7565 2018-10-07 21:34:21 げるあり！！！！！！
7566 2018-10-07 21:34:20 It's called #Winning!
7567 2018-10-07 21:34:13 He was actually offered a fairly lucrative deal from CBC to return to the booth and there was interest from multiple teams on being the coach. Also, just as an fyi, he didn't run the PP the entire time he was in Edmonton but did look after the PK at certain times as well.
7568 2018-10-07 21:33:46 ありがとですb

7569 2018-10-07 21:33:38 I’ve just checked who you have played , made my day , shitty have had 3 of the newly promoted teams and Huddersfield, do the oil men pay for the fixtures , fucking good sense of humour i give you that !!!
7570 2018-10-07 21:33:33 My fucking oil chiange was 50 TF
7571 2018-10-07 21:33:32 I ATE ALL THE CHILI OIL! _:(´ཀ`」 ∠):_

7573 2018-10-07 21:33:05 global problem talaga ang oil price hike kaya lahat apektado sa buong mundo.
7574 2018-10-07 21:32:54 I love making pasta with olive oil, nothing too aggressive, like Brenda “Brendo” Chenowith
7575 2018-10-07 21:32:54 Labour have never done anything for us. They quashed the McCrone report and did nothing about the poverty our people were living in after the discovery of oil. They used us to put their bums on seats in WM particularly HoL. They are the walking dead here.
7576 2018-10-07 21:32:47 Eyes were lilac affairs, distorted black hearts floated lillypadwise in the centers, crocodile fierce. An agent since the man pulled him from the viper pit, he felt his throat constrict at visions of Wholesale Sin, waltzersdemon, blood, oil on his hands.

7577 2018-10-07 21:32:46 I’m being bold as hell using this hot ass oil while only wearing a bra and shorts...bold or stupid
7578 2018-10-07 21:32:34 The "Big Stinkin Wheel of Cheese" meal at Easton Garlic Fest! They pre-cook the noodles (mostly), have oil and garlic heated in a saucepan, use grain alcohol to light the cheese wheel, & once the alcohols burned off dump the noods & oil/garlic in to melt the cheese into a sauce.
7579 2018-10-07 21:32:32 Hey Joel, still waiting on answers about coal and oil, if you’re keen?
7580 2018-10-07 21:32:30 What, and fuck with our oil supply? No way.
7581 2018-10-07 21:32:27 One of the reasons why PMB is hated by the owners of Nigeria PLc is because of oil bloc allocation. 2nd is the introduction of TSA and 3rd is that he ignores them.
7582 2018-10-07 21:32:25 There are so mny areas we can start our growth from

From Agriculture, to textiles, to manufacturing, to human capital export...

The opportunities are limitless, diverse, unique to Nig & very much possible if only we cn think & articulate strategic policies for them

Stop OIL nw
7583 2018-10-07 21:32:24 My mother’s hair is up, the house smells like hot oil, and I can hear neo-soul playing in the kitchen. It is Sunday evening and I am #home.
7584 2018-10-07 21:32:16 @atiku is a co-founder of Intels, an oil servicing business with extensive operations in Nigeria and abroad. He is also the founder of Adama Beverages Limited, and the American University of Nigeria (AUN), both in Yola, Adamawa.

He’s 1 of the highest employee of labor in naija
7585 2018-10-07 21:32:07 Let all Nigerians start to ask Looter Atiku (PDP), what again they are looking for, just 4yrs after looting and mismanaging above $650billion realized from Oil sales, 16yrs they were governing Nigeria. They should first explain to us what happened to the money? Criminals indeed.
7586 2018-10-07 21:32:00 I’d suggest Motrin but not if it’s a daily issue. Definitely try the peppermint oil though.
7587 2018-10-07 21:31:45 I did find some marinated mushrooms in Sainsburys. Mistakenly thought they were pickled but turned out to be in oil. Absolutely foul! lol
7588 2018-10-07 21:31:42 And also fence oil your reins every now and again it will speed you up, like a pie cover. Stretchs.
7589 2018-10-07 21:31:30 literally coconut oil and then tan is amazing I look so soft and smooth
7590 2018-10-07 21:31:27 Collapse in revenue due to oil & naira depreciation.

7593 2018-10-07 21:31:07 They've switched to cannabis oil.
7594 2018-10-07 21:30:51 Why does red oil stew dry up fast?
7595 2018-10-07 21:30:43  She will cook palm oil rice for you ..
7596 2018-10-07 21:30:42 No dear.. buy perfume oil from @dejokecarew . She’s always doing promo too
7597 2018-10-07 21:30:37 Brilliant,I like her snake oil shuffle move 
7598 2018-10-07 21:30:35 Oh sisi hope you will be alright....i would probably suggest you heal first completely and then when the scars are there i think the best would most likely be laser...not sure about how much that would be or tattoo on one leg....but as it gets better use some tissue oil daily?

7604 2018-10-07 21:30:05 RT @LivingSafely: Haven't changed your vehicle's oil since June? Why not make an appointment at the garage today!
7605 2018-10-07 21:29:51 Trains not fast enough? (assuming you can shift oil with trains - it's been a long while since I played, lol)
7606 2018-10-07 21:29:44 Eh mana. They call is woke 
7607 2018-10-07 21:29:44 Also remember that Measure G will only stop new drilling, not the current work.  It will NOT shut down all oil and gas production in the County.  It only stops the new stuff.  
Make up your mind with facts and vote.
7608 2018-10-07 21:29:26 Yes u can and mix with ur choice of essential oil
7609 2018-10-07 21:29:23 Always fun and tiring @NY_Comic_Con but good to be home and not constantly smell butter, oil, and salt from all the popcorn vendors.  Triggered memories of when I worked in concessions in college.

7612 2018-10-07 21:28:53 They are just  joining the bandwagon of those hiking prices. 

if it was possible to hoard  Kombi seats like sugar n c'oil some  of  us  taisaenda kubasa/school this week
7613 2018-10-07 21:28:43 Respect is earned not owed to anybody. You made a choice to fight in political motivated wars for profit, doesn’t mean I owe you any respect. I’d respect you more if you laid down your weapon and refused to fight in any wars for oil, or profit!

7618 2018-10-07 21:28:25 Mr President, I love you, please go ahead and destroy the saudis, the oil of them is yours , take it all, the People in America needs it more then primitive People in saudis
7619 2018-10-07 21:28:18 Man I still manage to fuck up pasta eg forget to add oil and it sticks, and I have done my fair share of cooking, my dad is really into it so he kinda mentored me
It’s never late to start learning! I’m sure your mum’d be delighted to help you
7620 2018-10-07 21:27:50 Brexit is a con, a grift, bunkum spread by snake oil salesmen. It is a nearly bloodless coup by a bunch of short selling spivs and gamblers. Any government or politician with an iota of common sense should have nothing to do with it.
7621 2018-10-07 21:27:47 4. apple fritters

Everybody Japa like Japanese fight inside the bus 
And the idiot dey tell my pman say 
E ma worry sir

7625 2018-10-07 21:27:29 Sorry but that’s just not true. The only way to detoxify is to have working liver and kidneys. If those aren’t working then it’s transplant or dialysis. Everything, EVERYTHING, people peddle on here as “detox” is snake oil.
7626 2018-10-07 21:27:04 Lavender is also very rich in linalool. It's an effective sedative. Citruses contain d-limonene, the other molecule mentioned in the article. This is not harmful at the levels used in flavoring food. It's worse in the crazy essential oil ingestion people are doing.
7627 2018-10-07 21:26:38 Coconut oil is my go-to for SO many home remedies. #Hair #Skincare #teeth #cooking
7628 2018-10-07 21:26:26 Lmao nigga definitely gone have that oil in h s system
7629 2018-10-07 21:26:20 You should have been reading about how a rise Global Oil price is leading to an increase in Subsidy by the Nigerian Government rising. But you don't seem to understand why it should be so.

Well, here's a lay man's explanation for it.

Issa thread.
7630 2018-10-07 21:26:08 I like working in the South Flo section buuut all that olive oil I get on me is grossing me out. I’m all oily and ugh. I wanna work in the cheese section again. Scooping out spreadable cheese into containers was kinda therapeutic

7632 2018-10-07 21:25:41 #allergiessuck #Rapeseed oil unexpectedly hiding in food which doesn't have full ingredients list makes me feel like I have flu. Proper flu, not just a cold. Makes my bones ache, especially unbearable in one with surgical hole. Thanks for that! Time it was on #allergen lists.
7633 2018-10-07 21:25:35 The sad part about your Tweet, Andrew, is the fact that you or your friends have never actually spent the time to understand where Scotlands oil revenue actually goes.. So for clarity & future embarrassment for yourself, it ISN'T (& never has been) Holyrood. 
7634 2018-10-07 21:24:52 Can u pls do a pool and oil show for ur cumback ;)
7635 2018-10-07 21:24:41 Lmfaoooo that is me with the mimosas at the salon  But the cuticle oil is supposed to be done before all that. Idk why they put it on after for pics.
7636 2018-10-07 21:24:40 Will those deductibles magically drop if the ACA is repealed? If you think Insurance companies, who made the decision to raise the rates and deductibles are just going to drop then now, you should look at the oil market. Prices went up. Will never come back down. #profits
7637 2018-10-07 21:24:28 20 vol is best, also apply a ton of coconut oil before the bleach. it’s worth the $5/jar at Trader Joe’s because it’ll protect your hair
7638 2018-10-07 21:24:16 My hair is so long and healthy I’m shook! S/o to coconut oil
7639 2018-10-07 21:24:13 Did you coconut oil the scalp first manee. You gotta have the shiner on deck for the wedding pics
7640 2018-10-07 21:24:10 Yeah you basically boil water in a pot(I usually put smth between 1-1,5 litres), add salt for taste and olive/any other oil so that pasta doesn’t stick & add the pasta + set the cooking time (written on the pack)
Just check that water doesn’t boil too much and goes out of the pot
7641 2018-10-07 21:24:06 I, too, struggle with acrylic paint. For me it is the lack of vibrancy in mixed colors. I cant make a decent green no matter which yellows or blues I mix. None of the colors behave like watercolour or oil. Add white-chalky. Add black-muddy. Also, fluid medium qualities are yuck.

7646 2018-10-07 21:23:33 I celebrate the joy that others find in Nutella, but I have way more of a fat tooth than a sweet tooth, and for me, at least, the centrality of chocolate and hazelnuts to what Nutella PURPORTS to be led to disappointment when the main lipid medium was mostly plain old palm oil.
7647 2018-10-07 21:23:27 95% people of Pakistan,I feel sorry for all of u!!This man Imran has taken away foods from ur children mouths because skyrocketing food prices!! Take my advise and go buy kerosene oil!! Thats the only way u can kill ur hunger.

7650 2018-10-07 21:22:54 I agree with much you say, but the real reason for WW1 had far more to do with Germany opening Iranian oil fields.
In fact, it had everything to do with Iranian oil fields.
7651 2018-10-07 21:22:35 At its core though, it seeks to increase gas consumption and discourage hybrids.

Gas taxes could be raised overall slightly to offset loss in tax revenue, but that solution would decrease gas sales, this bill potentially increases gas sales, it’s all about $$ for oil companies.
7652 2018-10-07 21:22:28 Ah sure he could sell the country's oil off like Ray Burke and nothing would happen to him. Why should this be any different? This is standard operating procedures for gombeens.

7656 2018-10-07 21:22:09 If you're gonna use oil during the day, make sure it's only two or three drops, and let it sink in well before applying your makeup. For nightly use, you can go a bit extra and layer oils even. Two drops of each is what I do. A few minutes later I put cream and occlusive overtop.

7662 2018-10-07 21:21:29 Your tweet implied Scots hatred of English. I disagreed. Independence makes sense to many who have now made Scotland their home. SNP keep on with  independence because  the people vote for them and their policies. Oil now $85 pb. and climbing. Scots voted to remain EU.

For 16yrs, they were in government, with revenue realized from sales of Oil above $650billion, with nothing on the ground to show for it. Want to come back to power, 4yrs after, without any explanation on what happened to the $650billion.

7670 2018-10-07 21:20:15 Get into what? If you mean what I wrote in my article, that depends on your skin type. If you have dry skin and it gets flaky, consider focusing on humectants and occlusives to trap in the moisture. Oil also works well for during the day. Dry skin generally drinks them up almost.

7694 2018-10-07 21:17:15 Oil, gas & majority of electricity comes from Scotland. Oil is distributed through English ports, like many other products like Whisky but the books don’t show it. Hopefully not for much longer Deborah. We voted to remain in the EU.

7771 2018-10-07 21:06:12 Well, if you are from out west that has a lousy quota versus Ontario and Quebec, I will buy whatever is best. Say no to our oil? Then we say no to your dairy. Supply management was set up under Trudeau Sr. to appease Que and Ont dairy vote at the expense of the West.
7772 2018-10-07 21:05:59 Lmao mine either I’m tryin get my oil changed
7773 2018-10-07 21:05:46 I hope you are aware that oil is at much lower price than 2013.

7779 2018-10-07 21:04:57 Atiku was in charge of the economy team and supervised most of the reforms and privatizations. That government paid our debts and left over USD60bn in foreign reserves at a time when oil prices averaged $40 (between 1999-2007)
7780 2018-10-07 21:04:56 Only if you count oil and gas - which given the moves against fossil fuels, suggests that's not a great basis for a long term economy. In terms of other 'physical goods' go on then, name the items Scotland is producing.
7781 2018-10-07 21:04:54 someone please make me go get my oil changed or let me pay someone to change it before my car falls apart
7782 2018-10-07 21:04:46 Did the currency plan change? I heard plan A, B & C. UK £ official or unofficial or Scots £.
RUK = large trade deficit, the loss of oil as an actual resource would be disastrous for them.
Iscotland in EU it is then, or does British nationalism trump all?
7783 2018-10-07 21:04:35 Very smart
7784 2018-10-07 21:04:14 There was oil that was spotted down the back stretch, which is why the caution was extended.

7786 2018-10-07 21:03:56 Create a culture with a disdain, minimum allergy, for oil based products.
7787 2018-10-07 21:03:33 You need a note saying “go for a walk”, a candle lighter/bottle of oil for your scent gadget & a bar of Bornville in your’s.

You also do showers & nice smelling hand cream.

7791 2018-10-07 21:02:48 More CO jobs in clean energy than oil and gas!  57,000 working in clean energy, 26,000 in oil and gas. And one of those sectors does not poison neighbors. Guess where the future is! @RepJaredPolis @jaredpolis is on the right track, Stapleton would mean Trump in CO. No thanks.
7792 2018-10-07 21:02:29 you are showing us a price tag with no cooking oil? You must be sick upstairs

7794 2018-10-07 21:02:23 Dear.
Please check international  rise in the demand of oil.
Price is directly related to demand.
If demand is going to high then price will up.
It apply to all goods.
No matter who rule the country.
This why Trump is asking Saudis to produce more oil.
So the price goes down.

7820 2018-10-07 20:59:01 As NZ $ drops & oil prices rise fuel prices go up. Travel round Tauranga on toll roads & see how quickly "taxes" rise. Someone's going to have to pay for neglected transport infrastructure. How would you do it Simon Bridges if you aren't charging taxpayer in tolls or fuel taxes?
7821 2018-10-07 20:58:58 Is she referencing something this weekend that I should know about but probably don’t because I’m not paying attention? Should I go grab some oil for my lamps?

7825 2018-10-07 20:58:40 Real Science does not go by the percentage of the number of Scientists agreeing but rather by facts and evidence using the Scientific method.  The majority of Scientists have been wrong in the past.  If you use ANY product that is oil based why are you not a hypocrite?

7840 2018-10-07 20:56:24 My #homemade vegetable stock is simmering in the pot.

Roma tomatoes, Italian parsley, sprigs of thyme, black peppercorns.
7841 2018-10-07 20:56:10 Did they find oil on campus? Where’s the money coming from? Doesn’t Gus have a $31 million buyout? Aren’t they still paying the Chiz?

7857 2018-10-07 20:53:59 Need more info. CA thought about similar due to reliance on gas taxes to pay for roads. Does Mississippi think likewise or is it to promote oil industry?

7868 2018-10-07 20:51:59 As a side note, CBD made from hemp oil doesn’t cause an addiction. It won’t get you high, but it can improve your health.
7869 2018-10-07 20:51:45 You can use hemp CBD oil and not worry about THC or it not being available everywhere.

7875 2018-10-07 20:51:12 The words oil and money are not racist words nor is money derived from oil. When the term is used to negatively contradict a club/players achievements then it is. Bare in my mind other clubs don’t get the source of the finances highlighted over again
7876 2018-10-07 20:51:11 Lolwut? The only reason the dollar has any value is because the house of Saud will only sell oil for dollars. They could destroy the savings account of every American with the push of a button.
7877 2018-10-07 20:51:07 Tough call for me.  I'm pretty sure both will be ranked in the middle or towards the bottom at the end of the season, so for now it's basically a coin flip for me.  I'd probably say Driver just because of the Oil Baron sketch but it's close either way.
7878 2018-10-07 20:51:02 once you extract all the baby oil, you're left with baby powder ;)
7879 2018-10-07 20:50:49 Hell NO! But CBD oil with a little THC just might stand a chance.  Can you believe they sell this in TN; I don't think I could be in a state redder than this one unless I were in Mississippi, West Virginia or Alabama! Wish me luck getting out of here tomorrow.

7889 2018-10-07 20:50:02 I went on a long rant about how nothing should be added to mac & cheese. No god damn lobster. No truffle oil. Just macaroni and cheese. It’s in the god damn name.
7890 2018-10-07 20:49:55 Super easy app.  Tin of pitted black olives, drained.  Jar of julienned sun dried tomatoes in oil.  3 cloves of garlic, peeled.  Food processor.  All in.  One minute or less.  Serve with olive/date crackers or thin sliced toasted baguette.  Super yum!
7891 2018-10-07 20:49:46 Prevent RU, and by proxy, China from buying their oil in anything other petrodollars. If that ever happened, which is RU, China, NK, and Iran’s goal, the dollar would collapse and make The Great Depression look like a picnic.
7892 2018-10-07 20:49:37 for sure, we wouldn't need oil anymore.
7893 2018-10-07 20:49:31 Lol these were also the same people wasting good coconut oil doing that oil pulling.

7895 2018-10-07 20:49:25 This is because of confounding. Tell me, what is a typical American's relationship with bacon? Is it on a burger, or is diced into a spinach salad with tomatoes and olive oil? Drawing associations from observational data can't tell you which context adds most to the risk.

7901 2018-10-07 20:48:42 @RebeuIn2Hood c'est comme les américains en quête permanente d'"oil" dès que ça parle de gras/gros/grosse il est à l'affut
7902 2018-10-07 20:48:42 He's a huckster, a seller of snake oil, a carnival barker, a fraud. Am I missing any?
7903 2018-10-07 20:48:34 I use my girl pum pum juices as my beard oil. Lmao nih freaky as hell
7904 2018-10-07 20:48:32 Yani eskinin denizaşırı ticaret monopolilerinin yerini (VOC), önce doğal kaynaklara ve altyapıya dayalı monopoliler aldı (US Steel, Standard Oil, AT&T, GE). Şimdiyse onların yerini yeni devler alıyor, o kadar. Ama devlet hem yerel hem ulusal seviyede eskiye nazaran daha kuvvetli.
7905 2018-10-07 20:48:22 You should be able to get hemp CBD oil which is legal everywhere as it as no THC in it. If you need help let me know. I can point you in the right direction
7906 2018-10-07 20:48:09 Your generation loves to burn the midnight oil. Well, this must be pretty ludicrous, I'd imagine.
7907 2018-10-07 20:48:01 ?? kavanaugh was confirmed and elon gat anotehr acid trip against SEC but this is businnes as usual and only of marginal meaning for markets right? and USA considers waivers on iran oil. but nothing confirmed. I'm still missing something.
7908 2018-10-07 20:48:00 Lavender was the first flowered plant used in men's colognes. The Romans extracted its oil and added it to their baths. They even stored it in little bags in their chests to scent their clothes. #protip
7909 2018-10-07 20:47:43 Sekof oil shall return to oil.
7910 2018-10-07 20:47:38 I’m here for an oil change! That’s it! Leave me alone!!!!

7913 2018-10-07 20:47:07 Kiatu murungi wants more money to go imenti so that he can use proxies to loot the same money and expand his oil company gulf
7914 2018-10-07 20:46:46 Let it go Barry.... he can’t understand what you mean. I suspect his only use is for dipping oil
7915 2018-10-07 20:46:43 Ain't it a healthy oil/ protein?
Or should I just keep quiet and say something like "you ain't missing out"? 
7916 2018-10-07 20:46:40 Anointing oil stops 'em from flying.
7917 2018-10-07 20:46:36 No conservative will be voting for the snake oil salesman named BETO. Yes he’s charismatic but he is still regressive Dem and his policies are disastrous. Not to mention he’s a filthy liar
7918 2018-10-07 20:46:29 Please update yourself n check the facts with stats the loan was already cleared.. And government earned a lot when crude oil was 50 USD Barrel.
7919 2018-10-07 20:46:20 Check your Engine oil today.
7920 2018-10-07 20:46:16 No. Because it’s Saudi Arabia. Had it been Palestine, Syria, Iraq etc they’d be all over it. Saudi Arabia is ISIS with oil and deep pockets.
7921 2018-10-07 20:45:57 Kwankwaso political era is close to an end after suffering humiliation defeat in the hand of former VP Atiku today in oil rich state of Rivers. No senator! No President!
7922 2018-10-07 20:45:47 I don't think he will upset his friends with oil to stand up for a journalist. Because he is a horrible person.
7923 2018-10-07 20:45:43 What kind of man pays someone to change his oil
7924 2018-10-07 20:45:28 While #USA government has oppressed #Iranian nation for many years... (since we started have our independence and our oil for ourselves) we Iranians love you the people of USA bc we know you don't agree with such behaviors... #Love you #Americans :*
7925 2018-10-07 20:45:18 He was part of the communist gov. You should look into his background. He held a position in the communist gov. His boss was taken down by gov already. Oil guy.
7926 2018-10-07 20:45:10 Baby oil
7927 2018-10-07 20:45:09 White House National Security Adviser John Bolton sanctions on Iranian oil exports may not achieve zero exports. The US is trying to make all countries stop buying Iranian oil but is “prepared to work with countries that are reducing their imports on a case-by-case basis.”
7928 2018-10-07 20:45:07 It was surplus energy that lead to prosperity - first the slaves, then the oil. System's broke and burning oil is hurting everyone.
7929 2018-10-07 20:45:02 @Oil_Drop Mostly Joe Simpson was here in 1984. Up and down from here to majors at that time.
7930 2018-10-07 20:44:50 Now the oil pump needs to be replaced as that is the threaded surface. So out comes the motor.

7933 2018-10-07 20:44:18 Who uses CBD Oil?!! Do you love it? What do you use it for! Looking for some info!
7934 2018-10-07 20:44:09 Texas from 19 to 9?  Pollsters are rubbing a little too much CBD Oil on their noggins. Sit back and watch the Big12 dismantle itself.
7935 2018-10-07 20:43:54 Ahh this is made with a baking block(swapped out butter as it’s cheaper ) so more veg oil may be a bit easier who knows .
7936 2018-10-07 20:43:44 I actually hear you. But America did not make middle east slaves to Sharia law. Yes, America wanted that oil, but the people of the middle east remain uncivilized and living in a forgotten world.
7937 2018-10-07 20:43:25 all of my downloaded videos are music except in the middle of it all i have that snl skit of adam driver screaming about being an oil baron
7938 2018-10-07 20:43:25 World oil prices are closing in on $100 a barrel. @NRMA chatting to the @TheTodayShow before 8am about how high prices will get and how to save leading up to Christmas
7939 2018-10-07 20:43:20 Kiara is a  loan interviewer that likes Olive oil on their sausage pizza with champagne
7940 2018-10-07 20:42:53 The high smoking point of rapeseed oil works so well with high temp bbq.  Made amazing roasties and crispy chicken skin
7941 2018-10-07 20:42:11 sure! another tip: castor oil will be hard to remove since its consistency is thick so i shampoo my hair without wetting it first and it does the trick. bc without doing that, even after 3 washes.. there will still be oil residue in your hair
7942 2018-10-07 20:41:55 I’ve heard CBD Oil for dogs can help with her conditions.  Poor gal, she has nothing to be anxious about - she’s lovely!!
7943 2018-10-07 20:41:50 Why is unity of Nigeria sacrosanct to Nigerians, Nigerians knew Nigeria is not one, Britain forcefully amalgamated people with diverse culture because of resources (oil and gas) from Biafra land.
7944 2018-10-07 20:41:47 Rolf, sounds good to me.  More of these "climate snake oil salesmen" should expect pushback.  All I have ever asked for is evidence about what they claim.
All I have ever gotten in return is a manure sandwich.
7945 2018-10-07 20:41:37 I like that idea Ian. I am a Mechanic, and there are products available called pre-luber, and post-luber. Mainly designed for turbochargers, they are basically an electric oil pump with a timer, that pressurizes the system before startup and for up to 20 minutes after shutdown.
7946 2018-10-07 20:41:25 Snake oil salesmen must just love you

7951 2018-10-07 20:40:37 To me, you are just bluffing, EU, Russia, China, India, etc. are with Iran. They are successfully tackling the Rial strength crisis. You cannot keep your promise to zero Iran's oil export. They are walking on the Win road.
7952 2018-10-07 20:40:36 no oil in the water Mr. Nelson. none.ty
7953 2018-10-07 20:40:34 I have seen at lahore amir road shadbag  lakho dair area  illegal iron industries burn plastic dirty oil to melt iron causing esthima  and spreading pollution in environment kindly close down all such industries
7954 2018-10-07 20:40:33 @Valvoline I get my oil changed in my 15 GMC Sierra by you guys every month. When I went in last they noticed they last used synthetic blend. I always get FULLY synthetic. I appreciate the $18 discount but I think I deserve a free oil change 
7955 2018-10-07 20:40:32 @EmilyDanielle3 is currently witnessing me getting yelled at about my oil this is why I don’t come home
7956 2018-10-07 20:40:30 Oil changes aren’t expensive, but I feel like they take longer than necessary.

7958 2018-10-07 20:40:23 And what is the “new oil” when it comes to the tune of $6trillion/year references the report:

7964 2018-10-07 20:39:42 Ferrari had the best car before they caught "cheating" by adding engine oil the fuel and for their suspect dual battery.

Now Vettel has to compete on a level playing field he's lost his bottle and is making too many mistakes.
7965 2018-10-07 20:39:36 today i talked to jesus and he said "why the fuck are you idiots still pumping oil and gas like its the 20 century? hello, its called the fucking sun and wind! why the fuck do u think i created the sun! whatever, ill see you all sooner then. ahh god these humans so dumb."...lol

7975 2018-10-07 20:37:53 My brother paid for my oil change, stacked my fridge up and filled my tank all the way up 
7976 2018-10-07 20:37:28 I actually just need the oil. I need my small chops oily. Let me be feeling the ororo. Not some cardboard doughnut 
7977 2018-10-07 20:37:27 That questionable thread about Kevin Odanz's sexuality is ridiculous. So saying something makes it true. Let me quickly say I own 15 oil wells then, since once you write something on Twitter, it automatically becomes true.
7978 2018-10-07 20:37:22 Before the party, eat one or 2 olive oil spoons , it helps a lot
7979 2018-10-07 20:37:22 there is more - like understanding that the US has tripled its oil production in last decade - while Canada has been stunted w/ modest growth - ask why? ask why the eco-terrorists always uses the term "tar sands" to be derogatory? ask why no protests appear at import terminals?
7980 2018-10-07 20:37:22 Roasted veggies and chicken. You can use teriyaki sauce, Italian herbs, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, etc. (not all at the same time!) Good luck.
7981 2018-10-07 20:37:19 La prima volta che andai sulle torri di Mirabilandia si chiamavano Torri Gemelle. Cambiarono ovviamente il loro nome dopo il 2001 in Discovery e Columbia, uno shuttle che si disintegrò nel 2003. 
Ora si chiamano Oil Towers e sono a tema caccia all'oro nero. Generico, suvvia.

This man has made more money in the south through oil wells and INTELS.
Be there deceiving yourself.

7989 2018-10-07 20:36:26 You know, @pierremoscovici that SPAIN is a huge drag on the EU economy. The Catalans produce "bread from stones" as the saying goes "de las piedras hacen panes." CATALANS have no oil nor gas, only themselves! Just ask exiled President @KRLS!  It should make you THINK, M. Pierre!

7992 2018-10-07 20:36:00 If this happened in an Iranian embassy- US,UK,France would have come down harshly. Saudi regime can get away with anything as long as they help guarantee oil supplies, buy weapons, keep Iran in check and publicly stop criticizing Israel while allowing funding of global Jihadis.
7993 2018-10-07 20:35:23 get nine more and you can get a free oil change!!!

8002 2018-10-07 20:34:07 She is a coward and traitor to party and America.  I cant believe her constituents give a crap about Roe v Wade, Presidential immuninuty, special interest rights, or environmental concerns.  They want their oil checks and special fishing/hunting rights which Trump handed you
8003 2018-10-07 20:34:01 Hahahaha. Was he no oil painting? Not a catch? You surprise me!!!
8004 2018-10-07 20:33:48 Soooo, climate change helps saving oil ? Sounds like a very 21st century paradox (and a great opportunity for jevons effect).
8005 2018-10-07 20:33:29 Using TM bread as a benchmark is a bit like someone else using Olive oil as a benchmark for cooking oil prices, I think there is something amiss there ... you don't have TM branches within reach of a lot of people
8006 2018-10-07 20:33:20 Global oil prices don't really support extraction at current rates.

8008 2018-10-07 20:33:15 Y’all I just watched a cooking video of a man frying chicken. He didn’t season the chicken OR the flour and just put them in the oil. And before you ask, yes, yes he was.
8009 2018-10-07 20:33:15 Boil and mix with a lil bit of oil( butter or coconut oil, palm, olive etc ). Find the recipe on google . For me the strength doesn’t matter as you can’t overdose anyway.
8010 2018-10-07 20:33:09 It's cooking oil!
8011 2018-10-07 20:32:51 i was gonna put hair oil in my hair and just remembered  back in highschool when I would shake joe's hand in the morning he would say that smelt my hands  smelt good and asked what i put on them but all it was hair oil and lotion.
8012 2018-10-07 20:32:49 Ken are you daft? Do they not teach civics in J-school? This is the great Constitutional compromise between the large and small states. They created a bicameral legislation because otherwise there would have been no United States.
8013 2018-10-07 20:32:32 Yemen has no oil
8014 2018-10-07 20:32:29 The minister's plan boils down to CDNs taking the CO2 Tax hit in return for us being in the oil/gas game. hitting CDNs because we provide up to 20% of US refineries oil is unfair. In effect the USA Offloads their GHG burden on us. Yet none of this changes world GHG balance

8038 2018-10-07 20:28:34 Hi, my daughter has just had some food intolerance tests done. One of the things that is flagged up is coconut, which is a huge problem as I always make her your recipes, often using coconut oil. What could I use instead of coconut oil do you think? Thanks
8039 2018-10-07 20:28:27 It is worth it lol.  Get coconut oil and rub everytime you remember
8040 2018-10-07 20:28:16 Good call, plus the cooking oil is a cheap replacement for fuck butter.

8046 2018-10-07 20:27:06 The CBD oil that I use is very low in THC, which means there’s no euphoria. It’s by far more gentler than the medicine that I used to take 8 years ago. Ativan beware. Cymbalta beware. Those drugs nearly killed me.

8062 2018-10-07 20:24:01 Bought a pipeline to placate Alberta. Subjective nonsense. Canadians don't purchase oil, companies do. You are aware that there is more to the Canadian economy than oil, correct? And it's booming. Legacy indeed.

8065 2018-10-07 20:23:24 If Dems win the senate, they can approve healthcare for all. They can keep beautiful pristine land away from oil refineries and fracking (imagine the Grand Canyon blown up to search for mineral deposits argh). They can keep beaches free from big corps who would ruin tourism $$.

8068 2018-10-07 20:22:46 Nope, the financial crises was well over in 2012 n all the big economies had recovered to some extent. World economic indicators were saying global economy is reviving. Oil price were on a record low in a decade.Dar had golden opportunity to steer the economy in right direction.
8069 2018-10-07 20:22:41 @RModiByoSouth am sure u r not in th dark on recent price increases what exactly is happening coz it wud seem sme retailers r jus ripping consumers off.United refineries hsnt increased its price for cooking oil but retailers are selling at $10,why??
8070 2018-10-07 20:22:29 What shocks me is this is the kind of crap I saw and heard working in the oil fields 40+ years ago as a young man. I was appalled then. But most of those ignorant asses were in their 40's 50's. Most R long gone. Now I see the same crap spewed from people my age and even youth.

8095 2018-10-07 20:18:26 We do agree! And frankly, we do not oppose wind power where it substitutes coal/oil/gas. In Norway, it does not. That's why we oppose it here. In a large number of countries, however, wind turbines are important in combatting climate change.

8181 2018-10-07 20:03:52 The article mentions that a gasoline storage tank trapped the oil mist. I don’t know much about gasoline’s chemistry - perhaps @Big_Orrin can help you better.

If natural gas was being stored, I’d have guessed it was holding wet gas that wasn’t put through a separator properly.

8198 2018-10-07 20:01:07 its a marketing and basically selling snake oil

8220 2018-10-07 19:57:07 I haven't actually looked into separation but if Alberta joined the US it would automatically retain the annual equalization payments which I think I saw is 20 billion.
Our oil would also sell at the rate of US oil which is double our current rate which would allow a huge boost

8253 2018-10-07 19:52:57 What they seemed to forgot is at some point during the Aquino admin, the price of crude oil is at highest (Aug2014) but we never had this inflation so bad. It was around 110 usd a barrel, current price is 76 usd a barrel and admin is saying it is the cause. You would just wonder.

8256 2018-10-07 19:52:28 That explain those inaccurate headline coming from certain media, the appropriation of the drop of unemployment rate engendered by the Previous Administration. But we sure don't forget the Oil inflation and the tariff on products moving to Asia.

8290 2018-10-07 19:47:13 Actually he said that because he had decided that  British naval ships would transition from coal and steam to oil. Some people thought this flew in the face of British tradition

8315 2018-10-07 19:44:10 I mean, he's also forgetting the fact that Christ was anointed 3 times by the Holy Spirit, just as David was, as well as being anointed with oil by Mary of Bethany.
8316 2018-10-07 19:44:00 Just 4 points separate the big boys from Bournemouth. Damn!

8325 2018-10-07 19:42:49 I know this will never happen but I PRAY they come to Lucas oil stadium in Indy.
8326 2018-10-07 19:42:41 Fantastic plan! I am guessing you have a problem with green house gases and your solution may be to bomb all oil refineries? Feeds into Trump’s narrative that leftists are chaos Mongerers and don’t have constructive solutions to problems
8327 2018-10-07 19:42:30 Ferrari lost their "illegal" power advantages (adding engine oil to fuel and suspect dual battery) and subsequently the pressure got to Vettel causing him to make mistakes
8328 2018-10-07 19:42:20 Your scientists have the least to worry about.  They will be needed to find more oil for the Trumpies.  You? You should be worried about when they decide to lock you up for treason.
8329 2018-10-07 19:42:20 So whose gonna tell him we replaced the scotch with olive oil?
8330 2018-10-07 19:42:14 What will drive this growth. Reforms with no zuma loyalist cabinet after good anc election in april 2019? Going to be hard with a nov sarb hike. Rising fuel and $95 oil.
8331 2018-10-07 19:41:51 Ok

8340 2018-10-07 19:40:39 That’s the price of olive oil through the roof then 
8341 2018-10-07 19:40:34 I got lavender oil & nickelodeon slime.
8342 2018-10-07 19:40:19 TBH, he would factor in time to make sure he's in peak condition to perform at his best so I can totally see this. He can be yoked and also burn the midnight oil.
8343 2018-10-07 19:40:16 Everyone is buying their oil......
8344 2018-10-07 19:40:15 Twitteé tanto acerca de mi mamá y su aceite de coco que me empezó a seguir una cuenta llamada "Coconut oil"

8347 2018-10-07 19:40:03 I’m off that oil
8348 2018-10-07 19:39:58 Soak the rice in water that just covers it. In a pot boil 2 cups water for every 1 cup rice, add a teaspoon of cooking/olive oil. Rice should soak up the water, once it does and looks cooked (white) add rice to the boiling water. When cooked, rinse off with cold water & steam
8349 2018-10-07 19:39:41 @seunokin if rice was going for 9000 at exchange rate of 197 in 2015, over 80% of the rice were imported. Today significant quantity of the rice are home grown and it all started happening when earnings from crude oil drastically and significantly fell.
8350 2018-10-07 19:39:25 If you are serious,then fight for Real True Democracy by terminating this rigged system of an unrepresentative of the American People”Electoral College”as we have experienced with Bush 43 and now experiencing with this Russian planted snake oil brilliant salesman Donald Trump !
8351 2018-10-07 19:39:19 and really man Im just a good old fashioned American citizen terribly concerned about what is being done to modern conservatism by the jackals who think they can fool everyone. You peddle snake oil
8352 2018-10-07 19:38:49 If it weren’t for oil you guys would be just like Iraq
8353 2018-10-07 19:38:44 theres a protest on w 34th and i cant tell what theyre protesting bc theres signs abt decolonizing puerto rico, one abt stop the war on korea, one saying stop killing trans people, another about oil profit then i just passed a man wearing a maga shirt whats going on

8355 2018-10-07 19:38:39 Are you sure it was even stew? Maybe palm oil with leaf and sprinkled egusi

Brown the onions in olive oil prior to putting in the slow cooker.
8361 2018-10-07 19:37:48 I need a damn oil change
8362 2018-10-07 19:37:33 Fall is here! Remember to check the camber oil and metalloid offset in your Dance-A-Cow™, or call your dealer and schedule a tune-up!
8363 2018-10-07 19:37:30 Hot oil treatment and deep conditioning . This is real self care
8364 2018-10-07 19:37:19 Got whiplash when I heard that report. Last I heard from trumpf, climate change was a scam perpetuated by China. Either way oil company profits are valued higher than future generations.
8365 2018-10-07 19:37:07 Are you aware that as oil is selling at $80 per barrel, this govt is earning more than Jonathan govt ($100 a barrel)? Calculate $80 x 360 and $100 x 180.

Should we talk about the impunity, cluelessness and nepotism of this govt? No directions, no vision and no competence.
8366 2018-10-07 19:37:06 Amazing, how food companies soft-peddle undesirable things, by noting that the product has only "a hint of" [sugar, salt, oil].
8367 2018-10-07 19:36:48 By saying you are healthy is not providing fact snake oil sailsmen did the same things you never once aired any journals and sites nothing just simply said I’m healthy which is  anecdotal so no you provided no evidence of anything
8368 2018-10-07 19:36:48 @Yulisha It was an American owned Oil platform rig Piper Alpha that exploded in 1988 killing over 180ppl in worst case of Corporate manslaughter in Scots legal History  and #Russia had no part in that
8369 2018-10-07 19:36:43 The oil was in a bottle with water so i could spray it on the stones but I was super thirsty and took 5 giant sips from it instead of my drinking water.  Still alive.. I think that's a good sign.
8370 2018-10-07 19:36:43 Well that’s really the question isn’t it? We sell them weapons. And buy their oil.........

8373 2018-10-07 19:36:25 not when they want to go to Mtoko center and be told Kombi fare is now double or triple and upon asking the price of cooking oil. .they get a injury time shocker of a prize and their son in Harare tells them ndatofamba netsoka kuenda kubasa uye kuno zvava worse rent yakwira
8374 2018-10-07 19:36:16 Mr president I HOPE YOU ANALIZE WHAT ONE + BILLION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH AUTO'S WILL DO TO INDIA? USE CHINA AS TEMPLATE !THEIR POLLUTION AND DESEASE RATES! AND FINANCIAL OUTFLOW FOR OIL MANY PROBLEMS!
8375 2018-10-07 19:36:14 Crude oil will hit $100 per barrel before july 2019.... 
You control oil and you control the World...
8376 2018-10-07 19:36:02 She supported her decision with the most well reasoned argument I've ever heard. An epic speech.  
Its little wonder libs dont understand it not possessing the cognitive skills necessary. 
@SenatorCollins personified true American values
8377 2018-10-07 19:35:52 Oil money yet your still receive aid and you are poorer than us with weaker currency....Y'all must be doing so bad.
Close your big mouth.
8378 2018-10-07 19:35:48 “Grace.. you must have some in you.” Jophiel’s head snaps up when he hears the voice, he’s clearly a demon, Jo could see his real face. “We already killed the rest of your clan. What chance do you think you have? A bit of holy oil and you think you’re the dogs bollocks.”
8379 2018-10-07 19:35:43 Fwiw, I had an oil slick color done a few weeks ago and am not shaving it off for nobody or nothing. (Yeah I know that's a double negative.)

Sorry u probably want real advice idk abt this stuff but I think it's better if u dont get a juul bc then if you use it all the time you will come to rely on it more than h rely on cigs now
8388 2018-10-07 19:34:45 Because Trump.

He's in bed with the Saudis and he hates the media. 

BTW, enjoy the higher gas prices as Brent crude oil has risen some 51%.
8389 2018-10-07 19:34:36 Watch yesterday’s recap and it’s the same defense men who let 2 goals in jack Johnson and oil Matta  they are the worst and Murray over there not doing any saves rip our defense
8390 2018-10-07 19:34:24 Nonsense  it is no more difficult than Norway’s oil. They manage fine. And make a profit. Also loads in Firth of Clyde that we cannot extract . Due to the monstrosity that is trident.
8391 2018-10-07 19:34:21 vape oil. Please I must see
8392 2018-10-07 19:34:11 It's no that much more expensive I think they should make it standard. Plus when you go that spec the rear couplings have proper covers and oil collectors
8393 2018-10-07 19:34:08 Of course! Rex Tillerson, before his departure as Secretary of State, ensured the profits of the oil industry.
8394 2018-10-07 19:33:53 Do you remember @theresa_may standing outside No.10 saying she was going to be a peoples Prime Minister? Exactly...So don't trust #May again, she is nothing but a seller of Snake Oil, a second hand car seller of cut & shunt policies with sawdust in the gearbox.

8395 2018-10-07 19:33:53 Unfortunately, right now electric cars also cause CO2 emissions, since electricity in Europe is mainly based on coal, gas and oil.  A fossil fuel car causes 1/4 of the CO2 emissions caused by an electric car because of the ineffiencies in the electrical grid.
8396 2018-10-07 19:33:47 Those are a nice mix! My shampoo is argan oil & cream rinse is coconut. Last week I ran out of shampoo so raided a box of sample size shampoos my aunt gave us, found one that smelled like wildflowers & Timothy hay! Everywhere I walked that day I was followed by wasps & bees! 
8397 2018-10-07 19:33:44 Butter, or olive oil
8398 2018-10-07 19:33:34 Di lang naman sya yung dahilan bat mataas presyo tignan nyo din ibang aspect katulad nung sa oil sakanya sinisisi yung pag taas eh sa world market naman nag taas din yung pag patay mag rereklamo kayo na madaming adik at dina safe ayan tingal adik nag rereklamo pa din kayo

8410 2018-10-07 19:32:06 The issue with @YouTube and all the social media platforms, they hide behind being a technical platform and not media.  And maybe that’s correct, but @youtube is populated with lots of people who are snake oil  Svengali selling the very worst the world has to offer.

8412 2018-10-07 19:31:37 I wish I could go back to the Islam before the petro dollars of the oil boom, the Afghan Jihad and Islamic revolution :p While we are at it, before the cold war, colonialism and modern madrassahs.
8413 2018-10-07 19:31:33 This is a dangerous dance
8414 2018-10-07 19:31:27 My, my, my.  Pay attention now.  The world is getting colder.  And it’s likely to get even colder for the next 20 years—before a new, stronger cycle of sunspots begins, as they have for eons.  The sun's cycles are statistically very  accurate.  We are going to need coal and oil.
8415 2018-10-07 19:31:22 Great.  Now lets ramp down our "production" and work on actual energy Independence without relying on our Finite Fossil Fuels.

Maybe you are not aware, but natural gas and oil and coal are all solar products.  Wouldn't it be wise to go right to the source instead?
8416 2018-10-07 19:31:11 MEDERMA... look into that. Vitamin E oil as well but definitely mederma.
8417 2018-10-07 19:31:06 Also I just think I ate like 5 tablespoons of straight up oil but like whatever

8425 2018-10-07 19:29:50 There is but it is expensive to extract compared to other sources of oil.
8426 2018-10-07 19:29:50 Because of oil, we have a better standard of Living, longer lifespan, clean water, clean air, A house, a car, schools, and better “MEDICATION”   Denying this standard of living to our children and grandchildren is to send them back into the pass where living was harsh.
8427 2018-10-07 19:29:44 Lol me too, hate olives, love olive oil 
8428 2018-10-07 19:29:43 You’re right about that! Very sensitive electrically and also oil wise!
8429 2018-10-07 19:29:23 I just deep cleaned my  apartment, partially pays for bills that aren’t even due, got my oil changed and made a full ass meal. Idk what the hell is wrong with me

8431 2018-10-07 19:29:18 Leaving the IMF is usually a reason for the US to go to war with that country.  Look at Cuba, North Korea, Syria & Afghanistan. Venezuela was also wanting to leave the IMF and they currently have US troops there "waiting". Venezuela also has oil that the US wants, like Syria.
8432 2018-10-07 19:29:02 The oil, which makes you strong enough to prey on your people, is made of the remains of their forefathers.
8433 2018-10-07 19:28:58 i made a Halliburton oil livery for my g37 coupe in forza 3 that was pretty awesome. should make it again lol along with an Enron one
8434 2018-10-07 19:28:54 Bam oil does wonders for the body , itchy gat notin on me 
8435 2018-10-07 19:28:49 we could get pretty close to achieving out Paris ghg targets if we simply stopped producing oil for the Americans. Sounds simple doesn't it? If we did that the Americans would import oil from somewhere else or start producing more oil. In short ghg would be produced elsewhere..
8436 2018-10-07 19:28:14 This man deserves beating.

8439 2018-10-07 19:28:01 Come up with an oil alternative and their world prominence tanks. Can't eat sand.
8440 2018-10-07 19:27:50 Because of oil, we have a better standard of Living, longer lifespan, clean water, clean air, A house, a car, schools, and better “MEDICATION”   Denying this standard of living to our children and grandchildren is to send them back into the pass where living was harsh.

8441 2018-10-07 19:27:42 That is what I say when they want to drill for oil I want 5 years of crops
8442 2018-10-07 19:27:37 This guy is amazing. I got his little oil can "Will the circle be unbroken" and "Bootleg Turn" on repeat added to the playlist. 
8443 2018-10-07 19:27:36 Not to be off topic. Please may you relay the message that there is serious price tag craze in town. Cooking oil price ranges between  $10 & 15
8444 2018-10-07 19:27:34 Agreed I think the cheap oil to Glencore was to sweeten the deal to sell the uranium mine at discount price. Guptas win

8448 2018-10-07 19:27:13 The 2012 multilateral sanctions resulted in a loss of 50%+ in terms of Iranian oil exports, but it also coincided with a sharp fall in oil prices in 2014 and general low oil price environment. This combination lead to a significant fall in Iran's oil export revenues.

8450 2018-10-07 19:26:55 My modest proposal…

W/ @CPC_HQ  gov't in 2019, #pipeline support thru #Saskatchewan, #Manitoba to #Ontario, can't we build a new #EnergyEast supplying #Albert ethical oil to heart of our nation?

A real, achievable, CO2 reducing, nation-building @OilsandsAction, no?

8456 2018-10-07 19:26:07 The poverty in Gabon is overwhelming. The corruption is evident. Gabon, a former OPEC member (1975–1994) that rejoined in 2016, is the sixth-largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa, and has the region's fifth-largest oil reserves. Oil money does not reach the people.
8457 2018-10-07 19:26:07 LOL, look how you manage to slip oil drilling into the conversation. LOL At least you are transparent in your greed.
8458 2018-10-07 19:26:06 We dont need press statements. We need fuel in those service stations and cooking oil in those supermarkets
8459 2018-10-07 19:25:56 My grandfather spent a lot of time over there in the 60's and 70's, made a ton of money (oil engineer), told me it's went back 1000's of years since then. Money and power.
8460 2018-10-07 19:25:40 We use AI with models trained with massive quantities of data so even a slight change in a big ecosystem will trigger some alarms, by the way farmers never fake their oil, this happens much later in the supply chain
8461 2018-10-07 19:25:13 Hey #Idiot, NORTH DAKOTA IS NOT MOOCHING OFF ANYONE, ESP CRAPHOLE CALIFORNIA. WE ARE A HUGE PRODUCER OF CRUDE OIL, COAL, & ELECTRICITY. AND FARMING.

8468 2018-10-07 19:24:21 This situation now needs addressing immediately with all due respect Mr President @edmnangagwa prices sky rocketing like crazy. Cooking oil (2litres) now going for  $10 to $14. Please say something. In fact do something about this. All hopes on you
8469 2018-10-07 19:24:19 Don't follow oil stocks. At 0.008c/share is that a 7 bagger? Oh, in suspension. Not many AVLO buyers...doesn't look like a winner to me but if you sell quickly, you might buy yourself a soft drink down at the deli.

8478 2018-10-07 19:22:33 I had oily skin foreverrr and recently my skin has become a total dry desert  so I had to completely change up my routine, one thing that’s been changing my skin is jojoba oil it’s like magic in a bottle
8479 2018-10-07 19:22:30 That’s just pro oil rhetoric! None of which are true or remotely related to exporting boat loads of diluted bitumen through Metro Vancouver for oil companies.

8484 2018-10-07 19:21:59 They were also quick to a NO vote on Independance. If we had followed you down that path we as a country would already be bankrupt. Oil Geologist say that the oil industry is now dead in Scotland so control of the oil industry is no longer a valid point

Matthew 26:7-9, Mark 14:3-5, Luke 7:37, John 12:3-5 all report that Jesus was anointed with expensive ointment (i.e. not a special substance that was stored in a special container which was prepared from pure olive oil)

8494 2018-10-07 19:21:10 What else are they doing? Shrinking national parks to auction chunks off to oil companies? Abolishing Net Neutrality so ISPs can charge fire fighters huge fees to facilitate emergency communication while hundreds of square miles of California burn? Gutting healthcare?
8495 2018-10-07 19:21:07 So what Adrian?  Balcombe has already seen Kimmeridge oil.

But Brockham we produce Kimmeridge oil before Horse Hill.

8497 2018-10-07 19:20:51 White soup as the name implies is mostly made from a lot of stumbling blocks (meat, stock fish, kpomo, periwinkles), thickner (I prefer yam), uzizza leaf and no oil. To the Akwa Ibom and Calabar people it is called Afia Efere while the Igbo people call it Ofe Nasala

8500 2018-10-07 19:20:11 I don't  understand why it's illegal, at all, anywhere. I know Pharmacy and big oil, along with some beer companies have thrown a lot of money to keep it illegal. Seems, like all other world problems, greed is the root.

8504 2018-10-07 19:19:50 I’ve not my head around the two big onions in olive oil.

Are you saying there should be two whole onions that one buys in olive oil, or put a huge slug of olive oil and put 2 large onions chopped up into the olive oil (the latter heated first or not).

Cook off the purée first?
8505 2018-10-07 19:19:49 Nina le, she better not

8527 2018-10-07 19:16:58 There is no doubt that Iran will sell at discount and that its oil exports revenue will fall substantially, but we also have to remember that prices have increased significantly over the last year (compensating somewhat for the drop in barrels exported).

“Every single war in the middle east involving the western world is entirely about oil and money.”

No kidding.  If there was no oil there no one would care.
8554 2018-10-07 19:13:19 That's probably for the type of oil they use. All over in Thailand, Indonesia and China you will find a weird smell.even in their cooked veggies.
8555 2018-10-07 19:13:15 Even this summer? A) can’t afford the oil and B) when it hits 30 degrees in the kitchen it’s off!

8613 2018-10-07 19:04:23 The issue aside from Trump, which is meaningless, is libs keep making the statement hearings not a legal proceeding, thus due process is inapplicable. 
She still makes the case some " new" as yet undefined standard is needed. Absurd.

8627 2018-10-07 19:02:43 All the major oil company websites acknowledge the reality of human caused climate change and the need to do something about it. Some are more straightforward than others and the statements are easier to locate on some than others. I try to provide links to deniers.

8630 2018-10-07 19:02:31 Just like albertas oil and oil sands are a naturally occurring 100% organic resource. In reality the oil sands are natures oil spill as they are close to the surface and naturally leak into the athabasca river. Mining them is a cleanup

8653 2018-10-07 18:59:58 Luckily you'll get lost at least 14 times on the way and it's very likely you forgot to check to see if there was any oil in the engine so you'll be stranded and have to call a man to come save you AGAIN.

8665 2018-10-07 18:57:23 Alberta’s plight ignored, sowing dissent and conflict between provinces, allowing Canadians to continue purchasing oil from foreign producers, neglecting the development of a critical resource. Yeah, great legacy.

8680 2018-10-07 18:55:42 - Why America gets so involved in the middle east-
Oil, duh. Plus in the post WW2 period, preventing the Soviets from spreading communism and getting Oil. Which was why Ike initially avoided Israel and developed alliances with Egypt, Turkey, Iraq and Pakistan. All fact.
8681 2018-10-07 18:55:42 Of course oil bonds were fetched from your grandfather's backyard right??

8689 2018-10-07 18:54:47 1/2
I think the issue is if you panic buy say..cooking oil ryt..other customers wont manage to get some due to shortage of stocks on that particular retailer..remember theres a process whereby that cooking oil should be transported from the supplyer to the retailer
8690 2018-10-07 18:54:37 Use bio oil! You can get it at Walmart or target. I put it on 1-2 times a day it helped so much. I also put some into my lotion bc a bitch loves to be soft af

8692 2018-10-07 18:54:21 Oh that does sound good. For today I made brussels sprouts with fish sauce, honey, garlic, soy sauce, & I added in mint & a bit of rice vinegar &  initially baked brussels sprouts in olive oil and salt. The main downside: possibly overcooked them just a bit
8693 2018-10-07 18:54:14 The voice of the people is the voice of God - today, 2L cooking oil selling between $12 - $18 depending on where you live!

8707 2018-10-07 18:52:16 You know by now I will demolish ur argument with facts. D key driver in petrol prices is crude oil prices, which reached upto 145 USD during MMS reign. During Modi reign, luckily for him, it even went down to USD 40s/50s. This guy @Shehzad_Ind is merely fighting a personal battle

8712 2018-10-07 18:51:27 Yes. I have followed it with great interest since Chavez. I was living in Spain & speak fluent spanish. The news there covers South America well. 
I must say that Venezuela has always been socialist & it only became a "problem" for the west when their oil was nationalised.

8719 2018-10-07 18:51:10 We need to bring the biggest law suit against the oil and car companies....
8720 2018-10-07 18:51:09 I went to see my grandmother last night, she prayed over me with oil and such and I instantly felt a peace about my self and my life. 

How cool was that
8721 2018-10-07 18:51:04 I tried earlier just castor oil plus coconut oil wasn't seeing any progress
8722 2018-10-07 18:50:57 Omg thought I was safe enough not mentioning the olive oil

8729 2018-10-07 18:50:17 And I suppose you have documented polling results to back up your rhetoric?
8730 2018-10-07 18:50:16 Nobody wants to take away contraception.  You have been sold some snake oil.
8731 2018-10-07 18:50:05 I’ve bought my last ever tin of Chaokoh coconut oil.
8732 2018-10-07 18:50:03 Incoming ‘uk single market’ ‘Barnett handout’ ‘someone to help with all the oil burden.’
8733 2018-10-07 18:49:41 @KMutisi has decreed from on high that you don't need cooking oil. Why must you choose other causes of death from congealed arteries when government-mandated bp and stress are free?
8734 2018-10-07 18:49:34 According to a chemical engineering professor at my university, we have 11 years to convert entirely away from oil energy otherwise the planet will eventually become inhospitable to any life.
8735 2018-10-07 18:49:19 US has put strong sanctions against Iran, which start next month. This means countries will not be able to trade with Iran, doing so, they risk a sanction on themselves. Today, Petroleum Ministry issued a statement that India will continue oil trade with Iran despite US sanctions
8736 2018-10-07 18:49:06 水(ウォーター)とは仲が悪いです。
8737 2018-10-07 18:48:48 Nothing to do with me who is sucking who's cock. I will say as humans we gotta have compassion n be accountable of our actions. When money and oil concerned human lives are worth nothing. You seem not to care or acknowledge Saudi atrocities. No wonder West despise you.
8738 2018-10-07 18:48:38 it's a fake pic.  Even silly shops don't put cooking oil on same shelf with mineral water. We in a crisis but let's not exaggerate it kkkkk
8739 2018-10-07 18:48:20 Day7 of #HairFacts: Our body does produce oil called sebum via the #oilGland connected to the follicle, sips onto our scalp and skin to prevent #moistureLoss and as a shield. #NaturesWay. #GoodToKnowFact
8740 2018-10-07 18:48:07 You might be thinking of just fish oil. Cod liver oil and fish oil are different. But in case you are referring to the correct product, your parents are the exception. Most people are taking it for vitamin A and D, and spirulina does not replace it by a long shot.
8741 2018-10-07 18:47:47 That's a well earned feast! Look at all those sichuan peppercorns floating in the chili oil

He had a age as way, him knew those age as oil.
8746 2018-10-07 18:46:56 let that happen, watch us stop pumping oil like in ‘73/‘74 and watch the popular movement to re-establish the Saudi-American alliance after oil skyrockets.
8747 2018-10-07 18:46:26 Exactly! Idk why I never thought of this sooner! I could’ve had my oil changed, car washed , all types of chores done 
8748 2018-10-07 18:46:22 Do it! Yes, did the olive oil mash on toast, the whole thing...
8749 2018-10-07 18:46:13 I hope you don't consider olive oil as a vegetable oil?

8752 2018-10-07 18:45:42 They tell us not to panic. Now all those who panicked have cooking oil. Those of us who heeded the call not to panic don't have it.
8753 2018-10-07 18:45:37 Won more leagues than you will ever win sunshine . Football started before 1992 and before your oil money arrived .
8754 2018-10-07 18:45:19 This will really hurt tens of millions of American homeowners who use oil and natural gas to heat their homes.
8755 2018-10-07 18:45:16 We should know. 9/11 terrorists were mostly from Saudis Arabia, some prince funded them. But oil.
8756 2018-10-07 18:45:16 A lack of billionaire oil money would stop you, lol.

8763 2018-10-07 18:44:22 Stop the equalization payments. Promote internal oil&gas mfg. Restructure the indigenous consultation process during industrial and commercial developments. Calgary had it good for so long they got spoiled.
8764 2018-10-07 18:44:10 Tx Railroad Commission:

8769 2018-10-07 18:43:41 That’s sad. Buy a water pistol & set up your hose or a bucket of water and dowse the cat, they hate it. 
It’s not the only solution, but it may help act as a deterrent.
They also don’t like the smell of citronella essential oil - available in all health shops.
8770 2018-10-07 18:43:41 cool kinfe mite want to put a little oil in it os it opens smoother
8771 2018-10-07 18:43:37 But that's beside the point. Spirulina in no way, shape, or form replaces cod liver oil. It's just an absurd claim.
8772 2018-10-07 18:43:33 Lol sure we're that greedy we always book bags on. How else would we get all that balsamic and truffle oil home?
8773 2018-10-07 18:43:28 I liked many things. Most people said operator for the money. When I first started I didn’t even think about the money. I just wanted to find out how crude oil breaks down.

8776 2018-10-07 18:43:16 No.  It's incendiary and will not end well unless there's some oil on the water.  The leadership has been discredited, they can't be heroes now so it's time to take them down.
8777 2018-10-07 18:43:15 Dont have oil anymore so for now ill stop

8781 2018-10-07 18:42:59 If you talk to most any of the people who actively take cod liver oil, vitamins A and D top their list of motivations. All of the articles I've read about it universally tout the retinol and D3 content as being the paramount reason for taking it. The fatty acids are a bonus.
8782 2018-10-07 18:42:58 I thought as much o

8787 2018-10-07 18:42:16 The only thing I enjoyed was the plantains and all that requires is heating up some oil.
8788 2018-10-07 18:42:02 Saudi King has Mansions. Trillions of dollars. 100 years of Monarchy. 200 years of oil reserves. Power to buy anything and almost anyone. Weapons worth almost $900 billion.
But Donald Trump in one sentence showed him that......

8789 2018-10-07 18:42:01 Don't agree with the bleeding ourselves part tho .. the whole country has been too dependent on oil ... it is sick.
8790 2018-10-07 18:41:57 And they ARE in a jam, because they have been forced to rally around such an outrageous, offensive, and terrifying candidate that it doesn't help them sell their agenda to the people at all.
"Pay no attention to the racist on TV! We just wanna gut climate regs and wage oil wars!"
8791 2018-10-07 18:41:53 It's great, I mix it with the shea butter, although I discover that the local Alison castor oil works just as well.

8797 2018-10-07 18:41:21 The way I make it doesn't require a blender.  I just chop 2 tablespoons of butter into small pieces, add 2 tablespoons of MCI oil, and put it under a Keurig set at the 12 oz setting.  Then I stir it up after the keurig is  done,  The heat from the keurig melts the butter.

8812 2018-10-07 18:39:35 Yep! I put some of that ‘brain oil’ (every bit helps! Can I chug the bottle?) into it too. But the refrigeration process slows things considerably
8813 2018-10-07 18:39:31 yes well the whole east coast is supplied by freighter, so pipe the #tarsands to them, meanwhile we have constant supply issues so say the price gouging oil companies here on the west coast where we used to have 4 refineries, they shut them to ship the jobs to slave labor market
8814 2018-10-07 18:39:22 More info and uses (great for skin too!)

8819 2018-10-07 18:38:56 Has this something to do with the Saudis refusing to increase oil production, the reaction may well be, even Trump is pretending to care about the dead Saudi guy but they don't give a damn.
8820 2018-10-07 18:38:52 Thought experiment: if every right wing, pro oil patch, pro industry conservative left Canada, where would that leave Canada? Would it become a socialist utopia? IE. Venezuela V2? Good luck.

8830 2018-10-07 18:37:40 I guess you’d expect a dealership to know how to put a damn oil cap on.
8831 2018-10-07 18:37:36 Be the first to admit I know zero about the science of any of this but how the hell does a concentration of oil mist even happen in the first place in one of these tanks? Isn't there a system to prevent that? And we have GPS trackers on pets FFS.....
8832 2018-10-07 18:37:36 we are chicken. Can't take any bold or independent decision.we don't learn anything from #Iran but always look to #Saudis & US for their NOD. We are scared to connect with Iran gas pipe line. For oil supply Iran can also lay another pipeline provided we trust in our own selves
8833 2018-10-07 18:37:31 Farmers would  put rust into oil to paint on barns. Rust kills fungi and mosses, the rust would make the oil turn red.
8834 2018-10-07 18:37:25 So it’s because PDP did 16 years that APC should also do 16 years? 
Yes, the price of oil is also a factor but what major policy  has Bubu put in place to change that

8860 2018-10-07 18:34:13 furthermore Canada's High net per capita is because we live in a massive country it's freezing cold where we have to transport everything at triple the rate of the USA. but it is our oil production for the USA that makes our per capita high.

8870 2018-10-07 18:32:51 Canada is an insignificant producer of net World ghg.. Canada per capita hi is because we produce oil for the United States. Liberal progressives want to punish Canada even though it will make no measurable difference to ghg or climate

8879 2018-10-07 18:31:20 The big problem right now is that oil burner needs so much air that I have to leave the door cracked and the flue wide open.

A lot of the heat just goes out the stack. Someday I want to build a proper burn chamber and heat exchanger for it.

India is dependent on Islamic nations for crude oil 

The speed with which @narendramodi govt focussing on Electric vehicles, CNG vehicles, renewable energy, solar energy, Bio fuel

It will reduce our dependency on  Islamic nations for our energy needs
8894 2018-10-07 18:30:13 I've seen many people on your comments that, when I look at their feeds, are working as shills or bots for oil and gas industry concerns. You should not reply to them. If someone seems like a legitimate individual with real questions, engage.

CHINA HAS REMOVED ITS 25% TARIFF ON OIL

WHY ISN'T THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA TALKING ABOUT THIS? BECAUSE IT'S A BIG WIN FOR PRES TRUMP?
8907 2018-10-07 18:28:18 @realDonaldTrump If you exempt from the oil embargo, it is clear that you are afraid and you are not a brave man of the past. We will not support someone who surrenders to the knees and will show a very tough response.
8908 2018-10-07 18:28:09 Aw cool. I've always been a fan of watercolor more and oil pastels
8909 2018-10-07 18:28:06 US sanctions on Iran forces us to buy crude oil at higher price from other countries which leads to charging the citizens more for fuel. Govt has limit ...even they can't reduce beyond a point as they have to balance the demand
8910 2018-10-07 18:28:01 power and truth are like oil and water. they just don't mix

Oil sands and a land route to Alaska.
8915 2018-10-07 18:27:35 It is important to ask activists in social media to spread this horrific news, so that people are educated to not trust oil money.
8916 2018-10-07 18:27:31 They made sure they polarised Libya after that. They needed the oil from Libya and also stop the influence of Ghaddfi on the world oil market. I need not mention Saddam Hussein. The fact remains that the USA and her allies needs a country like Nigeria more than we need them
8917 2018-10-07 18:27:10 Aren't you allowed to pour boiling oil down on them?
8918 2018-10-07 18:26:24 I don't get essential oil people. "We need stop using antibiotics and live off the land like they did hundreds of years ago" okay Karen they all died at 30 from common colds
8919 2018-10-07 18:26:20 Yes, i don't like using poison either,dogs lay in it, not good. Sticky traps r perfect. Sometimes they trap a baby gecko that slips in which are GOOD (they eat scorpions), so I check them often. If one gets trapped or on dog's paw, you use vegetable oil to dissolve glue&free them

8951 2018-10-07 18:22:59 So you can guarantee that no one will lose their jobs as a result of the future offshore oil and gas exploration ban and it won't have a negative impact on the economy and no corresponding positive environmental impact? Have you read the RIS?
8952 2018-10-07 18:22:47 If an oil sands producer reduces their emissions by one tonne, they same the same amount on their carbon tax bill as you do.
8953 2018-10-07 18:22:46 I squeezed too much coconut oil on my hair... and it's like I didn't wash my hair for 10000000 days...
8954 2018-10-07 18:22:46 FIIS are finding reasons to exit. Unless individuals volountarly stop using cars and bikes for short distances and rely on their legs, crude price rise can not be arrested. Simply go to jungle and enjoy Nature until the oil price crashes...

8963 2018-10-07 18:22:10 Yes,  I did several rounds of chemo in conjunction with the daily regimen of cannabis oil. The chemo nearly killed me and fried my entire system. The cannabis oil kept me alive and I believe it killed my cancer
8964 2018-10-07 18:22:08 No #AAOG in the weekly oil news round up simply because it did not issue news last week.

8966 2018-10-07 18:21:14 I didn't say they control our weather.
I said something is now happening on a planetary level.

And I didn't mention SUV's.
It's interesting to note, the largest consumer of oil in the world is the U.S. military.
8967 2018-10-07 18:21:12 @BrianBod1 I had a service and the manual said 8ltr, but after a few days same light came on, so I took a ltr out, and the oil level was then below max
8968 2018-10-07 18:21:03 For a guy owned by oil and gas companies you’re awfully mouthy on this issue
8969 2018-10-07 18:21:00 @maddow oil in Alberta and the Arctic provides incentive. And Canada will be left to it's own accord.

Indyref2 timing is not right, until Brexit has concluded, then there will be a much stronger case. I voted no last time as I was told it was the only way to remain in the EU
8975 2018-10-07 18:20:44 What deficit do you think an independent Scotland would have, what with our share of U.K. assets, oil, gas, healthy exports etc
8976 2018-10-07 18:20:36 Oh OK so then this will be the last time you purchase anything made with oil. You're as dumb as the day is long

8988 2018-10-07 18:19:20 So unless we are addressing the fact that we are all being sprayed like bugs and (((they))) control our weather, via this program, what is your point about talking about driving SUV's or (((big oil)))?

8996 2018-10-07 18:18:23 I was in an all-night diner downing cup after cup of coffee that tasted like engine oil when a new message from BB got me back on the track.
8997 2018-10-07 18:18:09 Ordered some hair oil on Amazon
8998 2018-10-07 18:17:08 Sure, but to be fair, Obama had a financial crisis to deal with, and had to spend to keep the economy running. What’s happening now can be compared with an oil tanker cruising at decent speed until the captain decides to burn twice the fuel to increase the speed 20%...
8999 2018-10-07 18:17:07 @SeumasBruce The only conservative I voted for was Lougheed. He was was progressive. Do not eliminate the carbon tax. We need to go forward not Ford. Major oil companies see this reality and taxes can help them look to other resources.
9000 2018-10-07 18:16:46 It never rains, but pours. I guess @KMutisi was correct. We should use inhwahwa instead of cooking oil.
9001 2018-10-07 18:16:34 The more things change, the more they remain the same.

2L Cooking Oil in Zimbabwe =USD $10 .    i.e R144.30.

9003 2018-10-07 18:16:27 This a sure sign of confusion....we thought the role of a central bank is management of the money supply and to this end fuel, cooking oil etc isn't part of money!!!!!
9004 2018-10-07 18:16:26 First I cook a huge sweet onion with salt in some olive oil. Cook gently until it's softened, then I add greens. That's all the sugar they need--whatever comes from the onion. :) You're welcome, @soulfoodscholar , and thanks for asking.
9005 2018-10-07 18:16:25 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
9006 2018-10-07 18:16:15 Maybe we can ask the FBI to do a back ground check on how much Big Oil has paid them to say that.

9019 2018-10-07 18:13:48 OIL. The oligarchs who run this country want it. Sod everything else.
9020 2018-10-07 18:13:43 depressing isn't it, all the people want renewable energy and yet there seem to be constant plans to setup the energy triangle and bring oil from iran into asia and europe.
9021 2018-10-07 18:13:40 so did everyone really miss the corner or was there oil on the track from Stenhouse

9030 2018-10-07 18:12:30 The Conservatives delayed their 2015 budget until after the fiscal year had begun because they hoped for better oil prices.

9036 2018-10-07 18:11:13 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
9037 2018-10-07 18:11:09 He may have done good in the beginning but he lost all respect with his snake oil scam marketing.  Its too bad cause he could do good for the space just promoting his own project, but chooses to be underhanded and to me no diff than eth scammers

9052 2018-10-07 18:09:33 Cost of production does not affect the sell rate. And new technology has significantly reduced the premium to produce oil sands.
9053 2018-10-07 18:09:33 @realDonaldTrump  if you want them to say that we have scared the superpower, and they surrendered, is it not a shame for the White House? Should give a strong and ferocious response to the criminal regime in Iran, and the full boycott of oil by November 4th

9056 2018-10-07 18:09:12 Nigeria has never lacked buyers...only thing we have had to do was give discounts and that depended on oil trading firms, discounts were never more than $7 a barrel...which is why we sell roughly at the same standard price Brent crude sells for

9065 2018-10-07 18:08:13 Iraq won't do anything coz today's Iraqi leadership feels Iraq is 4 Muslims. Yezidis were better off during Saddam's regime though Saddam had issues with shias. Shia Sunni rift will continue till eternity. @UN & USA will not do anything coz oil masters cannot b annoyed.
9066 2018-10-07 18:08:12 By the way, I don’t think the economy is great. The economy might be growing but in some sectors, like oil and gas, we’re not yet back to where we were before the recession. So, why are you lecturing me?

9073 2018-10-07 18:07:35 Yes but combine it with other oils such as castor oil or pepermint oil, as coconut oil on its own will dry out ur hair

9078 2018-10-07 18:07:20 A heavy loss in the midterms would benefit the democrats more than the republicans. It would hopefully teach this large group of Americans that the snake oil doesn't work once and for all, and lead to a great party reformation
9079 2018-10-07 18:06:52 Whereas I have ordered special soap from  that’s got no palm oil or plastic, as a non vegan I’m quite happy to use soap from the fat of domestic animals as was used historically.  Keep it as local as possible.

9085 2018-10-07 18:05:56 Listening to Mesley or the Scrum on mainstream Political  programs is our laugh In moments! Today Oliver said it was ok to have a LNG pipeline accidents because the gas goes up compared to oil going down?? So if we have a major explosion in Kitimac like lac Megantic , it’s ok?

9087 2018-10-07 18:05:36 Thank you Holly.  The prize was/is a great surprise and encouragement to me.  I see myself sometimes as a frustrated or ‘blocked’ painter making occasional forays with watercolour and oil.  Maybe I have found my medium with paper pulp.
9088 2018-10-07 18:05:27 Non genuine oil filter can cause that.
9089 2018-10-07 18:05:18 Thats the power of palmolein oil. Which gives a texture and gr8 mouth feel. Even kwaloty walls uses it. Its cald the hydrogenated vegetable fat and is present in everything that we consume from biscuits to icecream n what not. Why. its a cheaper source and competitive.

9097 2018-10-07 18:03:56 As for dose, given the fact DHA raises LDL, and we all know that LDL is bad for the heart, I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be a good idea to have high dose fish oil, or at least, if it would be - it'd be a big surprise given the facts we know so far. Just trying to go with plausible.

9131 2018-10-07 17:59:10 So what are the new gods? Money , retail , oil , computers . I don’t like them. They don’t make my human experience very metaphysical. 
9132 2018-10-07 17:59:05 The few things I know about cars: I know how to check my oil, jump start it and I know the difference of where to put windshield wiper fluid in and where to put oil in. The next man that comes up to me asking if I know what I’m doing I swear.... 
9133 2018-10-07 17:59:02 Why hasn't your other Senate colleagues said anything about this? Are they all bought by Saudi oil money? @SenSanders @SenateDems

9136 2018-10-07 17:58:20 Jaitley ji, you are undoubtedly the most dumbest FM of our country. 

It’s was Oil at an avg price of 115 $ that bloated CAD in 2011-12 12-13 & ur party then was only talking rubbish & misleading the country.
 
See yourself in the mirror u’ll know how silly or stupid you are.

9143 2018-10-07 17:56:59 Cooking oil $10! #madness
9144 2018-10-07 17:56:53 That's interesting. When Serena Shim was killed while investigating arms Turkey was flooding radials in Syria with in exchange for stolen Syrian oil, she "just died in a car accident." 
9145 2018-10-07 17:56:46 Quick! Dump the boiling oil.
9146 2018-10-07 17:56:42 try using a cleansing oil!
9147 2018-10-07 17:56:35 I'll be interested to see the gender impact assessment of oil production from Saudi Arabia. Oh wait, that's only required for approval of Canadian oil production! My mistake.

9151 2018-10-07 17:55:33 It's not just the humans, or how many, that make a State important...I'm guessing all the grain, oil, minerals and the 'few' people that work it are just as important as a mass of people stuffed into an office building...why do you want total control of ND anyway?

9155 2018-10-07 17:54:53 Unblemished my foot when refineries are fit for a non oil producing state and cattle ranches for oil producing states furthermore fighting a bias corruption against anyone perceived as a viable opposition. Go şiddon jarė make we hear word  what a distortion. SMH
9156 2018-10-07 17:54:53 Ive heard great things about CBD oil
9157 2018-10-07 17:54:44 Oil sitix I fix Browns games

9160 2018-10-07 17:53:53 Oil is EVIL, therefore Alberta is EVIL. Untill it repents and becomes Liberal.

9163 2018-10-07 17:53:32 If she really wanted to make a difference she would partner with a brewery to make a special edition Kavanaugh beer that’s brewed with ipecac and castor oil. Call it Brett’s Ralph Club Lager.
9164 2018-10-07 17:53:20 so for whatever reason my car has No Oil in it and idk how long it’s been like that bc i never got a low oil alert and im freaking out a little

9168 2018-10-07 17:53:00 Stop assuming things that you have no facts on, that picture you sent is not from PnP town, PnP hano disorganised shelves as shown an also that prize tag is not on the cooking oil so i do not know how you came to this barbaric conclusion
9169 2018-10-07 17:52:59 You do know that oil revenue doesn't go to Holyrood? Of course you do because every single reply on here has probably point out your error
9170 2018-10-07 17:52:59 おやすみなさい！！ちんちん！！
9171 2018-10-07 17:52:56 Coconut oil
9172 2018-10-07 17:52:39 This is the way to Go. Put their feet to the fire and extract real commitments on plans and programmes with timelines and variables should oil prices rise or fall
9173 2018-10-07 17:52:38 Craisins (dried cranberries), jalapeño, cayenne, banana pepper (any mix of peppers will do), garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, sage, allspice, salt and pepper. Basically, hot peppers plus whatever I had on hand while making the turkey!
9174 2018-10-07 17:52:26 so you are a progressive liberal?... What a silly response. the reality is Canada contributes nothing meaningful to world ghg. We could stop driving, stop producing oil,  stop breathing and it will make no difference to ghg or temperatures none at all. Sanctimony solves nothing.
9175 2018-10-07 17:52:20 Hunnigan, could you check and see if the BSAA has any units near the oil field?
9176 2018-10-07 17:51:49 What will anointing oil do?
9177 2018-10-07 17:51:48 No oh! Groundnut oil
9178 2018-10-07 17:51:44 I read that China is no longer ordering US oil  and that there is several tankers of US oil sitting in the Ocean wondering what to do with it. I also saw gas jump 10 cents two days later. We switch to blended gas now so it should be cheaper not more expensive.

9181 2018-10-07 17:51:26 There you go again. Why not buy both #UKOG and #ANGS as both going for the same Kimmeridge oil.
Angus for production and Ukog for bigger acreage ?
9182 2018-10-07 17:51:26 Boring again.
Thanks to 'hippies' for the arts to get away from these boring matters.
Luckily we had boiling oil when the British pirates tried to invade Buenos Aires. Nice french fries.
They only got the islands. Well, better than nothing.
9183 2018-10-07 17:51:09 Ichokwadi pnp.i bought there today @$3.69,one 2L per customer for every $10 purchase meaning you have to buy something for $6.31+c/oil to complete the transaction.But being a veteran of 2008 i bought plenty for my relatives kumusha.However they stopped selling until tmrw @$4.99
9184 2018-10-07 17:51:03 I’m trying to stay current here, so... (a) All Canadian hydrocarbon exports are bad. (b) Tanker collisions elsewhere involving volatile fuels are bad. (c) Imports to Salish Sea of jet fuel and Russian oil by tanker are safe and ok, as long as they displace Canadian products.
9185 2018-10-07 17:50:57 the year is 2100. the crude oil shortage has made air travel prohibitively expensive. enter: nuclear trains
9186 2018-10-07 17:50:52 I think this is simply appalling!!  What a hypocrite!  I think it's just shameful @DonDavies that Justin would spew such ignorance, you know we're all wanting that $15 per gram, moderately performing pot with that 13% tax, or $99 online, n I can get 99% THC distillates n vape oil
9187 2018-10-07 17:50:47 If they are mad at that, they are really going to hate how high the hurdle of Amending the constitution to change it is. Our Founders were Brilliant!
9188 2018-10-07 17:50:42 So no more cooking hot chips endlini. Cooking oil is now a whole $10.

9192 2018-10-07 17:49:43 I live in SA. Didn’t realize I’m probably the only one buying cooking oil from my local shops

9197 2018-10-07 17:48:50 It has taken u almost a month to talk about this.. Instead 9f educating common man.. U decided to be silent..

Very poor spokesmanship @BJP4India.. On oil and #Rafael
@narendramodi @narendramodi_in @AmitShah

9204 2018-10-07 17:47:36 school bus.  So, very tiny vs the volume of oil or natural gas or coal for the same output.  Even coal burns with a mild radioactive effect.  At Rowe I had to do the instrumentation for the fuel pool island. At the time the fuel was so weak it could not produce the heat to kill..

9206 2018-10-07 17:47:27 I can’t even enjoy the beach/nature knowing they are opening up our public lands to oil drilling and lumbar companies.
It’s over.
9207 2018-10-07 17:47:26 Is that oil dripping I can see?
9208 2018-10-07 17:47:23 Yes it's time to Route the Anti POTUS before he starts a war. They have no moral ground to stand on. Now let's investigate Lindsey Graham's Russian oil money.

9210 2018-10-07 17:47:16 This cake seems a more wholesome alternative to donuts; no frying and it calls for olive oil, not butter. If it’s any good, I’ll pass along the recipe. Say hi to Madison
9211 2018-10-07 17:47:16 Oo oil hahaha
9212 2018-10-07 17:46:46 Ufuna i holy Oil 
9213 2018-10-07 17:46:44 Is your hope to see renewables advance? Or to see Tesla "win"? Cause all along I thought the point of Tesla was the former. Oil companies taking an interest would seem to align with it. Or is it you just don't like BP in particular?
9214 2018-10-07 17:46:42 Ugly humid day but.... this wee house has central air!!! Not using it yet. But it’s like the puke bag in the seat pocket. Glad it’s there! And gas heat - no more oil!
9215 2018-10-07 17:46:38 apart from less exports than bangladesh due to destroyed industry, here is PMLN progress: CPEC: started in PPP time; 1300mw bijli: mostly generated thru most expensive and damaging source of oil/gas; NO DAMS and water planning; orange train not running, education worst in region

9219 2018-10-07 17:45:45 Add one more. Stop oil trade with Iran or we will impose sanctions. @narendramodi  let me think about it
9220 2018-10-07 17:45:41 Independent Scotland will have to beg Spain to get back into the EU. Then they will have to adopt the Euro. What is price of oil at the moment? What is ur economic model? Scotland's new capital city will be Brussels as a part of the EU Superstate. 
9221 2018-10-07 17:45:31 Our oil is Brent darling, Brent means sulphur free oil, that what Niger delta have

9231 2018-10-07 17:44:28 You gotta treat it right. Buy it fresh, oil it ip with Olive Oil, masage some Mediterranean Sea Salt into it, then let it tan under a broiler for a couple minutes each side.
9232 2018-10-07 17:44:20 Are we talking about pollution or DEW fires? Your all over the place. Do you know how many quarts of oil go into making one tire for your car?

9234 2018-10-07 17:44:08 Correction to my previous comment, let's make that 99% of responses here oppose your statement.
9235 2018-10-07 17:44:05 I think you should educate yourself regarding the amount of oil recently found and also being explored. Around 40 years of gas has just been discovered. Also look back in history, the sterling was first begun in Scotland. Luck really won,t be need
9236 2018-10-07 17:44:04 You heard him, California. Cease all oil extraction immediately. Those 400k unemployed workers will just have to wing it while you slap together their jobs retraining program, and while you build the infrastructure to bring your state to 100% green energy all at once. Make it so.
9237 2018-10-07 17:43:57 @realDonaldTrump If you want to register your greatest legacy in foreign policy, you must remove Iranian oil by November. Unless you do, unfortunately, your fall is certain, do not doubt. Americans people are watching

9245 2018-10-07 17:42:44 @realDonaldTrump It is impossible to make a short cut in the issue of exemption from the oil sanctions, we will never stop Iran for the sake of suffering people, I swear to God, we will not retreat a single step, your government has given a strong promise.

9254 2018-10-07 17:41:49 They still think that Tesla's are a toy for the rich. These are daily drivers, and demand will only increase because of we are almost at peak oil production. Prices at the pump will far outpace inflation. We don't need another tent we need more factory's.

9273 2018-10-07 17:40:00 @Tesco went for the weekly shop yesterday and was shocked at the amount of palm fat/oil in your own brand products. Do you know the origin of these products, probably from a destroyed rain forest?

9275 2018-10-07 17:39:56 Buy Silverbird oil. Most good pharmacies have it. It’s eucalyptus oil. Boil water. When it boils, pour it in a bowl or bucket, put a drop or two of the oil in the boiling water, hold your baby in your arms and sit close to the water so that he/she inhaled the fragrant fumes.
9276 2018-10-07 17:39:45 @TheRealBuzz Hi Mr. Aldrin,
 My great-grandfather is Clifford Enger (he owned the Beverly Hills Oil Company in the 1980’s). My dad told us a story where he flew in a helicopter that you piloted in Texas and you did a flip with the helicopter. Could this be true?

9281 2018-10-07 17:38:53 You’re not miserable - seriously, how many tote bags does a person need? If it was free CBD oil however ...... cures everything apparently ..... apart from cynicism 
9282 2018-10-07 17:38:44 Nigga almost died slipping on that canola oil
9283 2018-10-07 17:38:42 OBJ does not have any moral right to support or condemn any of the aspirants. During his tenure oil price was very ok and output too was good. The power plant he claim to build were all carcass,  zeroinfrastructural development. lots of looting with impunity
9284 2018-10-07 17:38:16 I’ve seen cannabis oil work on many people not just hear say, it might not be legal but it works that’s why it’s illegal, I take it your not a fan of Rick Simpson? You’ve got to give the man his dues he’s helped a lot of people
9285 2018-10-07 17:38:14 Better for white men, corporations, and oil lobbyists. For the rest of us, second class citizenship
9286 2018-10-07 17:38:12 Honestly, if I had a chance to do anything to Hitler via time travel, it would be to give him money for art lessons and a set of oil paints to practice with. Of course, we'd probably end up with some other asshole in his place.

9296 2018-10-07 17:37:22 Its these types of images that help spark the conversation to get actual treatments to the masses rather than having con-artist fish oil salespeople taking advantage of them.

9298 2018-10-07 17:37:13 Hi Maddie, I’m so sorry to hear about your mum. I know it’s tough but Please beware of snake oil salesmen. I can see you’ve had too many replies to read through the suggestions but have you spoken to the oncologists treating your mother about possible suitable clinical trials?
9299 2018-10-07 17:37:02 2l cooking oil now $10 this is madness...

9303 2018-10-07 17:36:15 @thisbar you realize that your vaunted bar contains one of the most unethical ingredients in the world right? Palm oil? The one thats responsible for deforestation in the tropics, indigenous people abuse, and native environment destruction. How can your bar possibly save lives?
9304 2018-10-07 17:36:14 Additional thing to say, there's also the Petrobas oil company stuff. Honestly I'm too forgetful atm but idk all the details, but there's a big sentiment this is all an attempt at a RW coup
9305 2018-10-07 17:36:11 Prevention: Granular BTi in birdbaths; also put the solution in old lids from jars and put it in your garden. Skeeters will lay in it but the eggs will never hatch. Protection: witch hazel tea in a rubbing alcohol carrier with 15 drops citronella essential oil.

9308 2018-10-07 17:35:44 Excellent. Glad to hear it.  

Smog, ozone, nox, sox, particulates, acid rain are all better for people like you having fought to make them better.

It turns out people like me have fought for that too.  Oil & gas spends more on environment than every other industry combined.
9309 2018-10-07 17:35:39 We have to significantly slow oil and gas  production world wide - or its over... where are those policies?
9310 2018-10-07 17:35:38 I’ll get the baby oil ready…

9328 2018-10-07 17:33:33 Lmao. You put oil in your pasta?
9329 2018-10-07 17:33:18 Faultless logic, that. Not that you should ever need an excuse to draw our dear lady Exalt. Haha! XD

And, hey, you’re from Singapore. Like I’m one to talk, but what are you doing burning midnight oil?

9331 2018-10-07 17:32:50 Oil based not available via FP10. Constant gripe of mine and others.
9332 2018-10-07 17:32:45 Nah, scrape all fat, oil and grease into Twitter
9333 2018-10-07 17:32:36 some type of devils cult for gas oil ..
9334 2018-10-07 17:32:35 Clearly, you didn’t even read the article you posted. While there is some downside to wind, the article points out it is FAR less then fossils fuels. Also points out that solar is 100 times less dangerous. Not likely big oil paid for the study.
9335 2018-10-07 17:32:23 Do you know why snake oil salesmen prospered back in the day? It's because people wanted to believe that what they were selling would cure them and they were great con men. Sound familiar?
9336 2018-10-07 17:32:18 The sad part is  people actually believe you. Snake oil salesmen is all you are.
9337 2018-10-07 17:32:16 It is not just AB suffering the consequences of @JustinTrudeau !  Canadians everywhere are financially lesser with a shre of much reduced O&G revenues.  Alberta O&G prices are 50% less than a comparable barrel of US oil - because AB has limied markets to sell into (no pipelines)!
9338 2018-10-07 17:32:07 Because the pubs are only for BIG business like the oil companies. It’s the small and medium businesses that will make the US strong economically. The pubs will eventually destroy our good economy, but they are certain to blame it on the dems

9379 2018-10-07 17:27:46 As Gordon Brown says the Americans knew Iraq had no WMD. So Blair's dodgy dossier was deliberately fake and not accidentally. It was always about oil. It always was and it always will be - especially for Trump.

9382 2018-10-07 17:27:27 I bet a good part of NE BC (the part with the oil and gas) would be happy to opt out of being run by socialists in Victoria. We also should annex the Shuswap area as most of the property is already owned by Albertans.

9402 2018-10-07 17:26:04 In case you missed it Saudi Arabia at the time held the majority of the worlds oil supply that was Saddam’s move.

9409 2018-10-07 17:25:27 oil sold at 100$ during Yaradua's administration you too should get that fact right

9412 2018-10-07 17:25:07 Either it is coincidence that crude oil price is down and election is close..
Or it is simply vote funda..

9415 2018-10-07 17:24:59 You can’t throw those people out of the country. They come here in private jets carrying $120m liquid cash stolen from the proceeds of oil to a well known local bank and register fake companies. Money laundering is real in Kenya. South Sudan got the worst criminals in leadership
9416 2018-10-07 17:24:46 I was trying to make fritos but we dont oil sis 
9417 2018-10-07 17:24:40 What is happening is some people know kuti kune vanhu vane dzungu and in panic mode. So for example, nthey will buy this cooking oil at 3.69 in OK First Strt and then go to your rural home and sell it for 10. Udza hama dzako dzingwarire and avoid hoarding cooking oil at 10 dlrs.
9418 2018-10-07 17:24:40 No because it was a UK vote. Scotland has no special right above other parts of UK.

That aside, Scottish independence would be economic suicide for Scots as the north sea oil isn't enough to sustain them and EU already said it wouldn't accept Scotland. UK is best place for Scots

9421 2018-10-07 17:24:29 I got motor oil in my hair and after about 6 times of washing it and it not coming out I found out all I had to do was wash it with fucking dish soap and now I feel like crying

9424 2018-10-07 17:24:16 If only the past Gov build a brand new natural gas power plant for power reliability instead of wasting $15 billion on Boondoggle Falls, construction costs & build time far lower and price elasticity would curb demand if oil/gas prices ever reached Nalcors insane projected cost
9425 2018-10-07 17:24:12 apa benda sia oil and gas ni
9426 2018-10-07 17:24:05 Bone broth, Cod liver fish oil/fish oil, Wheat germ oil, Chondroitin, Glucosamine, Shark cartilage, Pancreatin enzymes, and several other substances sold at health food stores are nothing but waste byproducts.
9427 2018-10-07 17:23:54 Trerrible idea. Time to move on to renewables. Oil and gas are filthy fossil fuels that are destroying our environment. Renewables create more jobs and don’t threaten our oceans and coastlines. No more dirty fossil fuels.
9428 2018-10-07 17:23:47 @TheRoyGreenShow missed your show yesterday-are you doing a segment on Canada's blunder at the NAFTA negotiating table needing US approval to non NA trade?  It weakens our position in any future trade deals.  They could have tried to renegotiate the price the US pays for our oil
9429 2018-10-07 17:23:35 Movie magic! In the film "There Will Be Blood", when Daniel day Lewis appears to say "milkshake", he actually said "oil". It took 30 million and 500 technicians to make the switch but in the end, it was worth it!
9430 2018-10-07 17:23:32 . That they spell thc wrong isn't the biggest problem. What I think is a problem, a new frame, is this:

Medical cannabis= CBD = in oil form = good

versus

Recreational cannabis= THC = smoked = evil
9431 2018-10-07 17:23:17 There's a load of hipsters smokin shisha and some bloke pure dousing his beard and hair in coconut oil and now he looks like he's gone for a swim I'm so confused why do it in the pub it's SPLASHING EVERYWHERE
9432 2018-10-07 17:23:12 Freeloaders ? Jealous much ? Our fathers lived in this land for thousands of years now you are jealous because we have oil ? You kbow we also have the third largest natural resources not just oil ao we won’t starve and you know how many civilizations were built on resources? All

9434 2018-10-07 17:23:02 The faces of corporate power. Here come the coal ash dumps, the oil spills, the new asbestos-filled building materials, all that "healthy for you" radiation, pesticides and herbicides in your water, air you can't breathe without getting sick, public lands raped --
9435 2018-10-07 17:22:57 I’ve just been using aloe vera gel, coconut oil natural things like that. He tried to tell me the reason the scabbing is so bad is because you “shouldn’t put bepanthen on tattoos” even tho that’s the first thing any artist will tell you to put on  just keeps sprouting out

9442 2018-10-07 17:21:42 People who follow the @Alberta_UCP and @CPC_HQ  are against #CarbonTax and #carbonpricing but rarely offer constructive options or solutions to our society's challenges. The parties attract many #climatechange deniers. Why don't they advocate for solar solutions in oil and gas?
9443 2018-10-07 17:21:34 It’s me. I am your mother who wants cannabis oil.
9444 2018-10-07 17:21:33 Cooking oil is going for $8 in Kambuzuma and $10 at my rural home

9448 2018-10-07 17:21:24 Labour could renationalise railways in five years.
Here we go, crank up the National debt., promise sweeties to everyone & generate a Venezuelan collapse albeit without the safety net of massive oil reserves. 
Insane.
9449 2018-10-07 17:21:24 Why don't you ask your Muslim brothers in the Middle East to reduce the price of oil, Allah hu akbar

9454 2018-10-07 17:20:43 ISouth Africa ipiko iyi...yedu chaiyo iyi? VaMutisi musareva nhema imi. Cooking oil is big business in SA and it used like everywhere else. Kumusha kwemagwinya uko, munoti vanoita ekukwatisa nemvura?
9455 2018-10-07 17:20:40 And then use them weapons to spill the blood on innocent Kashmiris & the Iranian oil would be used to fill the tanks of their Army Vehicles , Well-done Iran, won’t let any chance go away to spill innocent blood whether in Kashmir, Syria, Yemen or elsewhere
9456 2018-10-07 17:20:34 The Center excise duty is already fixed on oil, but state government impose #VAT on the current oil prices. It means of there would be any hike of oil prices it raise more revenue to States.
Then they should cut their #VAT on oil it will not lead more revenue loss of states.

9467 2018-10-07 17:19:50 No. We need someone that is more than an orator.  Her husband spoke perfectly, he said all the right things but then installed a RW healthcare plan. Expanded 2 wars into 7. Prosecuted whistle blowers,while letting bankers go free, millions lost their homes, Artic oil drilling, NO
9468 2018-10-07 17:19:47 That’s a good choice too. I like dual purpose gear, and I like having a small cal rifle that packs down like the Henry. 

Looking forward to getting that beard oil in the mail btw. 

The two Arabic virgins who prepare my beard each morning were running low.
9469 2018-10-07 17:19:31 International oil prices must fall to 50 US dollars a barrel, the world's US dollars return to the United States, the US economy is re-energized, the United States is once again great, and the US market has more money, so there will be sufficient employment opportunities.

9479 2018-10-07 17:18:14 What they said: wash & go

What they meant: shampoo, clarify, condition, detangle, deep condition, leave in condition, oil scalp, shingle or rake with curl jelly/gel, semi air dry & go.

9487 2018-10-07 17:17:11 What was the impact of out of control wildfires in California over the last couple of years? My guess is way more than oil and gas profits. A warming planet will cost California way more than can be gained by extracting fossil fuels over the short term.

9490 2018-10-07 17:16:36 The US is behind the collapse. It's all about controlling the global supply of oil.

9492 2018-10-07 17:16:33 It was spineless & she'll regret her weakness. Dems will use her as a weapon against @GOP then they'll spit her out of their mouths.

9495 2018-10-07 17:16:13 $PSX another name in the oil space that looks good and held well last week. 

Also look at $MRO and $MPC - not shabby.
9496 2018-10-07 17:16:06 adding to the above  without Demonetization, GDP growth Rate would have been at least 2%  more each year and that would have helped compensate oil bond payments, a lower fuel prices, Stronger Rupee & higher Tax collections also. Hope you know some Economics to understand that..

9505 2018-10-07 17:14:44 Just read a report, the reason 45 destroy environment protection, leave UN, sanction Iran etc is he wants to sell domestic oil and gas. Oil price is already on the raise. Like promoting coal, so backward mindset. Oil giants interests so big. Track back to  Bush. Watch out!

9518 2018-10-07 17:13:23 And what proof you have provided? Their word? Why don't you try it yourself that how much of that claim is genuine? And don't forget they looted us when crude oil was as low as 40-45$ per barrel and made more than 12.4 lakh crore in 4 years.

9527 2018-10-07 17:12:07 so in 2013, when the Gujrath CM said he will bring down petrol prices, he didn't know of the Oil bond deficits, & he never said he will bring  the pound/ euro down to 40s , it was only the dollar, without understanding the strength of the dollar ??.
9528 2018-10-07 17:12:05 i used grapeseed oil... and im lettin it airdry over night with the clips... u think i shoulda used more on my babies? 
9529 2018-10-07 17:12:05 That's true, but also save on oil cost
9530 2018-10-07 17:11:56 It's ironic. Wind power is the supposed savior of the earth only to find that it contributes more to global warming or change or whatever it's called these days  Not that you can believe Harvard studies anymore. Probably paid for by "big oil".

9533 2018-10-07 17:11:42 If you think California is "continuing the status quo," you've been misinformed. And "painful" isn't the issue. California shows us in practice it's willing to lead the way. The issue is the economic impact on the world's 5th-largest economy of a short-timed abandonment of oil.
9534 2018-10-07 17:11:41 Luckily good fish is pretty yummy all on its own -- olive oil alone could do it.

9538 2018-10-07 17:11:17 So let's propose we STOP CO2 tax by dealing with the reality that Canada is an insignificant contributor to world net GHG's. Much of our tiny net GHG is from  3 million barrels/day of oil for USA.  We could reduce net GHG to zero, it will make NO diff to temps or world GHG.

9555 2018-10-07 17:09:24 IN EVERY METRIC THAT CAN BE MEASURED >>> the American economy is moving forward. America is like a giant oil tanker. It takes 20 miles for it to turn around or even stop. Our economy is turning around and all people ARE benefiting. Democrats voted against this success & tax cuts
9556 2018-10-07 17:09:23 My 02 Nissan Altima burns oil slowly, every 1100 miles I have put 2 qts of oil in it, how do I fix this problem and when do I do an oil change since it just burns the oil anyways

9558 2018-10-07 17:09:22 #CarteBlanche All well & good to identify oil & weak Rand, but what's hurting the Rand? No1 = ANC LAND GRABS policy - which at the end of the day is an election ploy. So everyone is hurting so we can suffer under the same cartel of criminals. INSANE!

9561 2018-10-07 17:08:55 He was getting the oil long before Trudeau was elected. I suppose you think it's his fault oil prices tanked during the time of your Conservative government too.
9562 2018-10-07 17:08:47 Hillary was completely bought out by the Big Banks, Wall Street, Big Pharma, Health Insurance industry, Military Industrial Complex, Silicon Valley & Big Oil oligarchs.

In fact the whole US financial & business elite wanted Hillary to win the Presidency, for their own interests.

9572 2018-10-07 17:07:41 @SenatorCollins you are one of the many reasons why I am so glad I’m NOT an American. You’ve sent a message that “the squeaky wheel gets the oil”. You’ve also proven what victims have long known - even when we do report, it goes nowhere because a man’s able to be louder.

9577 2018-10-07 17:06:46 He is now talking about the oil in house of God and about the order from father to son. Not sure where we are going but I’m going to try to hold on.  I’m stopping here, this is going to be a mish mash of many different things! He called three different text before reading the 3rd
9578 2018-10-07 17:06:45 Mr Goel please don't force CM to take this step the impact is visible since yesterday as up till now the Bordering Petrol pumps have already stated celebrating by displaying boards that Oil is Cheaper in UP as compared to Delhi
9579 2018-10-07 17:06:45 Yes! CBD oil has helped a whole lot. I recommend it to everyone.
9580 2018-10-07 17:06:21 no problem. two more bits of advice. use vitamin e oil to lube the taper, this promotes skin elasticity. if it still won't go through, try under a shower head. happy gauging. shouldn't hurt anymore than a pinch and some pressure.

9587 2018-10-07 17:05:11 How is it expensive when it has cooking oil at $3.69 ? Musatyira panze pliz.
9588 2018-10-07 17:05:06 Let's be honest, whichever country helps keep oil prices low is the less evil in the eyes of America.
9589 2018-10-07 17:05:05 @LeahBracknell Hi Leah. Any chance we can privately connect regarding your post? My dad is on chemo so would be great to hear how you make your oil.
9590 2018-10-07 17:05:00 Oh, he knows better.  His statement is intended to influence those who don’t know how our system of government is designed.  Thank you mainstream media.

9592 2018-10-07 17:04:52 Yeah right. Maybe if they were Jewish graves. If they were Christian graves they'd turn the other cheek, oil up their assholes and ask Israel which way to go.

9594 2018-10-07 17:04:36 Major oil companies have both the "engineering expertise" to succeed in complex environments and the balance sheets to invest in large-scale projects

9601 2018-10-07 17:03:35 The wee witch is holding this country back by not declaring Indy 2 is not on the agenda,if we voted yes this country would be right in the shit at moment that none of you anti English bigots can deny as salmond talked one load of dogs bollocks about oil etc,the union we maintain
9602 2018-10-07 17:03:29 My housemate and some RL friends have trouble sleeping as well, and using lavender essential oil has actually helped a little (longer hours slept). Not sure if it'll work for you but worth a try if you haven't.

9612 2018-10-07 17:02:28 What I 'learned' from your show today: Ship vibrations kill all whales, and oil that is lighter than water 'sinks to the bottom for generations.' Would you please FIRE all of these low-functioning liberal idiots, Oliver particularly).  No wonder Canadians are so misinformed.  : /

Saskatchewan and Manitoba are farming provinces and don't have too much going on. Ontario is the "main"province and a big mixing pot. I believe 25% of residents

9645 2018-10-07 16:59:16 having a lot of debt on the balance sheet bc of fantastic capex expansion is ok temporarily. however, debt is like imported oil. you dont want to rely on imported cash or oil too long because someday the exporters will try to take you over by turning off the faucet. @elonmusk

9659 2018-10-07 16:57:57 Guess that's not a bad moral victory post. I'm sure by Wednesday u will have a better one. At least the conference is bad enough the snake oil salesman tactics will continue to work.

9673 2018-10-07 16:56:26 1. Yaradua was able maintain the economy because there was sizeable foreign reserves and okonjo iweala was able to "cancel" some of our debt, global economy bounced back around 09/10 and oil sold for 60$ as opposed to 45/50$ when buhari took over.

9687 2018-10-07 16:54:43 The radiator for engine cooling was under the starboard wing, and the oil cooler was under the port wing. That didn't change until the much more powerful Mk9, when both rads were similarly shaped.
9688 2018-10-07 16:54:36 Texas drinks oil and believes trump. Because they believe science is paid and there is no reason to trust it because it is paid. Not all Texans like that, but more than 60% are....

9690 2018-10-07 16:54:26 Is there anything more dangerous than bacon when it starts to spit? Pretty much have to do parkour moves across the kitchen to avoid the oil projectiles.
9691 2018-10-07 16:54:21 Don’t forget to add promoting oil in there with guns, abortion and race! They are issues that are rarely in separate pockets!
9692 2018-10-07 16:54:19 @BAP_Bangyongguk @BAP_Himchan @BAP_Daehyun @BAP_Youngjae @BAP_Jongup @ZELO96 Goodnight 
9693 2018-10-07 16:54:05 Gold diggers dig till then find oil
9694 2018-10-07 16:54:05 Friends that check if their products have coconut oil in them because they know I WILL use it without asking or looking at it are the true ones
9695 2018-10-07 16:54:01 Reminds me of the same cheers when Trump pulled out of Paris Accord. These shortsighted buffoons,  climate deniers don't care about Canada, our environment or future generations.  They just wana play politics which is as dirty and polluting as the oil they so interested in.
9696 2018-10-07 16:53:58 Government of India will exchange oil for rice with Iran to put rupees falling against the dollar.  Rupee will get rupee by barter system
9697 2018-10-07 16:53:50 Olbas oil bath 
9698 2018-10-07 16:53:09 I need my oil changed and my trash taken out. Let me go be nice.
9699 2018-10-07 16:53:05 というかふつうにちおさんのほうが可愛くないです？？？さっきみた写真めちゃくちゃかわいかったんですけどあのほんとかわいかった
9700 2018-10-07 16:52:58 If Canada dosent use the oil resource some other country will and we won't see a nickle, and be sure to vote
9701 2018-10-07 16:52:54 May be you are correct sir why reductions in oil prices just 2 days before announced the date of ELECTION.
9702 2018-10-07 16:52:53 Made oil for out hair.. was supposed to do hot oil treatment today but to much to do
9703 2018-10-07 16:52:51 If you struggle with anxiety and have been looking for a small solution I highly recommend CBD oil, not a cure but a definite life changer
9704 2018-10-07 16:52:49 I’m burning a Liz Earle candle at he moment. It’s scented with lavender & basil which is lovely, but there’s also an underlying smell of cooking oil  Will stick to beeswax in future.
9705 2018-10-07 16:52:46 Lol. Those are experimental societies. They are homogeneous, have tons of oil reserves the govt steals, don’t provide for their own defense, and all ride bikes cause they can’t afford cars. No one knows if they are going to work. There’s some evidence they are going broke.
9706 2018-10-07 16:52:40 But only if done properly.  Never steamed.  No feet taste. Never boiled. Fry bacon. Cut up. Put aside. Fry sprouts in olive oil&butter. Salt and pepper to taste. Add chopped pecans & a tsp + of Dijon mustard. Add cooked bacon and splash of lemon juice. . No funkiness.
9707 2018-10-07 16:52:17 I'm thinking of bringing back @RussellCroweUK in December. In July my Fibromyalgia got bad....and I was in one of my down phases thinking it won't get better again...then I tried CBD oil. Even though my pain is still there the oil calms me down.
9708 2018-10-07 16:52:14 No, you don't have to. They will go away by themselves. You can also put repellants like neem oil instead. I don't know if you are talking about invasive snails, but Wild animals should get some stewardship, garden plants can grow again.

9712 2018-10-07 16:51:45 Good luck! A little bit of Olive oil works better in cast iron imo- butter can turn brown and color the food.
9713 2018-10-07 16:51:32 @DJZinhle The Ad of Lifebuoy Tea Tree Oil and and Lifebuoy Honey   looking so Gorgeous   Wow
9714 2018-10-07 16:51:27 20 yr's ago PUTIN came on Stage&called Protesters Mobs,just like Trump has! He called Media propaganda! He took control of KGB, just like Trump did in this FBI investigation! Liked Cuba Dictatora&worked with him! Sold oil/coal to Kim Y U. Every one but him was to Extreme to rule!
9715 2018-10-07 16:51:19 hey sweet friends who suffer from major cramping during shark week, peppermint oil is a god-send and I highly recommend you give it a shot if you are looking for a more natural pain remedy or if the meds aren't kicking in fast enough.
9716 2018-10-07 16:51:15 For people who want electoral college gone, basically California and New York controls country. Red States produce 75-80% food, oil, probably rank there on gun  ownership. So doing away with electoral is my belief would probably be what triggers a civil war.
9717 2018-10-07 16:51:14 Yes. I have seen Cait's tweets on this topic prior to the panel discussion. I thought she looked like she wanted to answer. Some people on Twitter disagree. I guess we will never know unless Cait clears up the mystery of was she going to say something or not.

9721 2018-10-07 16:50:40 I finally did but I need to buy that your ofada oil for next time.. I can't continue with the palm oil bleaching 
9722 2018-10-07 16:50:37 to be fair.. all coal, oil, natural gas and natural tar IS sequestered CO2.
9723 2018-10-07 16:50:26 Honey/Olive oil's after eefects
9724 2018-10-07 16:50:25 Ha ha GDP down?
Rupee down only to US and not with other countries,means? 
petrol price increased,due to crude oil price increased. 
Unemployment? Do you know the impact of Make In India? Take only the telecom sector, Xiaomi,Vivo,Oppo etc all factories in India now!!
9725 2018-10-07 16:50:21 “End of sweetheart journalism on #Saudi”? I wouldn’t hold my breath. UK/US journalists have been doing their governments’ bidding in propping up the Wahhabi regime for 70+ years. Sweetheart journalism will end when the oil wells run dry, not a second sooner.
9726 2018-10-07 16:50:21 I bought some beard oil and all I’m saying is if you slept on me now don’t hit me up when I look like a whole lumberjack come thanksgiving
9727 2018-10-07 16:50:15 That's a very narrow vision. Even if resources are limited the use we make out of them tends to infinity because ideas are unlimited. For instance, if we improve engines to reduce petrol by half it's like the reserves of oil are doubling.
9728 2018-10-07 16:50:07 My first time going to Valvoline for an oil change.... I didn’t know it was so expensive 
9729 2018-10-07 16:49:58 and rubbed coconut oil
9730 2018-10-07 16:49:47 No matter how much they dont want to believe you. I saw those prices in picknpay today. If you are in bulawayo you can go to picknpay Ascot. You will buy 2litres cooking oil for $3.69
9731 2018-10-07 16:49:37 Oil of oregano or wellness formula supplements
9732 2018-10-07 16:49:28 Oil of oregano, vitamin D and fish oil.
9733 2018-10-07 16:49:17 Getting tired of having to get oil changes and filling up gas.. I will have a @Tesla sooner rather than later. Bookmark this tweet.
9734 2018-10-07 16:49:11 Two new oils fields and one trillion cubic feet of gas discovered recently get rid of trident there is oil there too so scotland will be a richer country and have the resources to rid Scotland of homelessness and poverty

9738 2018-10-07 16:48:17 Then they end up in the Middle East fighting for GOD (Gold, Oil, & Drugs) & realize they’re being used, come home with PTSD & then end up committing suicide when their country discards them. Not saying it’s right. Just saying that’s how it ends up.

9742 2018-10-07 16:47:38 Wouldn't we be making more domestically, at least according to Trump's pronouncements? And I don't think Mexico and Chinese oil is going to drive that figure up.
9743 2018-10-07 16:47:34 Don’t count @BP_plc out for investment stake in @Tesla — energy side. At least one big oil co will smarten up (take learnings from automakers’ late scramble) and joint venture with Tesla Energy while it’s relatively early.

9746 2018-10-07 16:47:15  caught red handed. But only in Pakistan alcohol becomes honey and olive oil. And drunken masters blood test shows guy is fasting whole month.

9751 2018-10-07 16:46:26 I suspected something was wrong with mark dice the moment he opened his mouth. I did follow my gut. Demagogic snake oil salesman. I'll take jbp over the poison you produce on your shitshow of a channel any day.
9752 2018-10-07 16:46:23 On our oil production we export most of it to the US who doesn't have carbon taxes so it doesn't hurt us a lot there either. 

I get I'm biased.  But in this case it's your bias that's showing.
9753 2018-10-07 16:46:19 I love all of you...just some of you boiled in oil.

9758 2018-10-07 16:45:30 Because Saudi Arabia has oil.

9760 2018-10-07 16:45:19 No Remain lost despite Osborne’s lies and publicly subsidised propaganda just as Indyref was lost despite Salmond’s bullshit economics based on fantasy oil price projection and nonsense plans for currency...
9761 2018-10-07 16:45:15 Go and check AMZN and NFLX. Netflix have more debt(>$15B) for movie production and they are $150B company. $1T AMZN reported only less than $1B annual profit. Tesla is disrupting Oil/Car/Car dealer companies. Obviously, there will be more upfront costs.
9762 2018-10-07 16:45:11 If Plaid want Welsh independence, they should quit with the dodgy videos and strike oil
9763 2018-10-07 16:45:11 I'm so sick of these state propositions where yes means no and no means yes. I swear I think it how the tricked CA into voting the "right to work"  into law hurting unions and workers. Trickery is a tool of the snake oil salesmen's playbook.
#CAMidterms
9764 2018-10-07 16:44:51 2/3. If one can fool “experts” and academics so easily, imagine what can be accomplished with unqualified social media personalities and snake oil GoOGs who bang on interminably about “evidence-based practice” but never mention practice-based-evidence.
9765 2018-10-07 16:44:46 Better get started, since the process of amending the Constitution was made intentionally arduous.  And I’m sure those rural states will happily ratify their demise.

9767 2018-10-07 16:44:23 So my oil plug has ghosted me that past week and I’ve been in extreme distress bc I’ve only picked up from him for years & idk anyone else
9768 2018-10-07 16:44:19 Also, the Iraqi war was about oil. Sadaam was a convenient fiction.
9769 2018-10-07 16:44:08 LOL 
It simply tells the story of a way of reducing CO2 emissions by simultaneously injecting it into the Oil/Gas reservoirs and recovering the oil/gas as an economic incentive.
9770 2018-10-07 16:44:07 Ummmm..... 
Ask the NEBC??
LOL.
No, I don't think so because it's a place not a thing.
And... the BC OGC has a list on their Web site.
The NEB is not an oversight for most of the oil and gas industry in NEBC. 
Again I say, it is you that doesn't have a clue.

Like yes, as much as I want to leave immediately I do need an oil change

9810 2018-10-07 16:39:17 I make a good crumble. Top tips: a little amaretto in with the fruit, some oats and ground almonds in the crumble. Always use butter for proper crumble. I sometimes make a vegan version with coconut oil. It's nice, but it's not really the same.

9814 2018-10-07 16:38:39 China has already stated they would still buy from Iran and they do not recognize US sanctions. They could easily import oil to the teapot refineries thereby avoiding any ZTE type situation...imho 2/2
9815 2018-10-07 16:38:34 Craig Oliver needs to get his facts straight.  The oil that is pumped down the TM Pipeline has a maximum gravity of 0.96.........that gravity of oil will float on fresh water let alone sea water.  In other words it will not sink to the bottom of the ocean off of BC.
9816 2018-10-07 16:38:29 Proud of idiot leaders that help to ensure your descendents pay for the messes the oil companies are creating? Gotcha.

9833 2018-10-07 16:36:52 I wonder if peppermint is connected with winter months because of its medicinal properties. Can clear up sinuses and cold junk stuffing up your head very well. Get yourself some peppermint essential oil if you’re prone to sinus/cold infections (and not sensitive to oils).

9893 2018-10-07 16:29:27 Nigeria has a high population of working age people and this is a great advantage if we move away from depending solely on oil, we have loads of other untapped potential.

9897 2018-10-07 16:28:55 They say that CBD oil is great for helping with pain and anxiety. Will it be enough to get through a #buffalobills game? Let's find out!
9898 2018-10-07 16:28:27 Indeed we do have a great deal for which to be grateful:  an economy that’s slowly regaining traction after the oil prices plummeted and a Premier in Rachel Notley who ensured, as much as she possibly could, that our social networks continued to serve the needs of Albertans.

9924 2018-10-07 16:25:33 The tikka one is easy: fry 1 chopped onion in a little oil for a couple of minutes then add 2 crushed garlic cloves & 1 tbsp tikka paste (we used one of those Patak’s individual pots of tikka masala paste) & fry for a minute or so. Add 500g cubed butternut squash & 2.5cm piece...
9925 2018-10-07 16:25:33 Economics is one easy area to focus on, and one in which separatists have no credible answer. The White Paper was a lie—it used oil as a basis despite saying it was a bonus—and the SGC report has turned out to be such a flop that SNP won't debate it.

For oven baked I toss the breast in a bit of oil and spices then toss on foil with a pat of butter on top so it melts down over it and really locks in moisture.
9933 2018-10-07 16:24:20 And @ApothecaryLabs will make oil to specifications for any parent who asks. I don’t get this fetish about acquiring from “legal” sources. Far better to obtain what you need from “trustworthy sources”, especially if your child’s health hangs in the balance.

9937 2018-10-07 16:23:48 Exactly.   That snake oil salesman is the GOPs best friend.   I have to take a shower after listening to any appearance he makes on tv.  He's like Gloria Steinem with a smaller dick.

9950 2018-10-07 16:22:29 Mangudya told Reuters that the fuel shortages had been caused by the introduction of a 2 percent tax on electronic payments last Monday, which meant oil firms would incur weekly bank charges of $400,000 for fuel imports but were not allowed to pass the cost to consumers.
9951 2018-10-07 16:22:28 I’m going by my experience administering oil to someone with seizures. 4-1 CBD to THC works best for her. THC aids the recovery from the draining effect of the seizure, which the CBD does stop immediately. Without THC however, the recovery period to normal energy is much longer.

9953 2018-10-07 16:22:13 IMO A lot of African countries serve as living examples of the worst side of human beings. Take Nigeria, for example. The land is being destroyed by the oil industry. Corrupt politicians steal the money they make from said oil

9958 2018-10-07 16:21:42 Communion, hand washing and anointing with oil. Christ brings us healing and wholeness as we remember His sacrifice on World Communion Sunday. #famfaithakron
9959 2018-10-07 16:21:42 They're "the kingdom" with their rich oil...and the West just kneels for those bastards.

9965 2018-10-07 16:21:12 Trader Joe's has been out of tea tree oil soap for over a month and, naturally, I need to restock my supply. When it comes back, I'll be buying a year's worth.
9966 2018-10-07 16:21:02 They've never been any better than a bunch if narcos. But instead if drugs, they sell us oil.
9967 2018-10-07 16:21:01 I'm boycotting DBs this month due to the religion theme but I heard Mitch drinks salad dressing? Maaaybe Fonda does too, all that oil
9968 2018-10-07 16:20:55 fuckin. this one vegan i know shared a video of like graphic animal death from ocean trash/oil spills & im like. can you. not.
9969 2018-10-07 16:20:46 Unfortunately, factual, physical proof is  not sufficient for those who have been conned by the greatest snake oil salesman of all time.
9970 2018-10-07 16:20:45 I just don’t see that lack of time and effort spent in Congress is our problem—it’s the $$ spent by donors who buy the output of that time and effort. We can’t get gun control because the NRA won’t permit it. We can’t get climate change regs because oil companies won’t allow it.
9971 2018-10-07 16:20:45 FROZEN TO THE JAWS OF PANIC COUNT TO THE PLACE HEAVEN PINCH BULLY MONGREL NOTHING DELICIOUS OIL POOL AWAY ALIVE DRAIN FREEZING

9974 2018-10-07 16:20:33 The strangest food I began was bulletproof coffee. Make a 16oz coffee and blend it (don’t shake/stir) w/ 2 TBS butter & 1 TBS coconut oil. I thought it would be nasty and coat my mouth. Actually goes down smooth like a silky latte and keeps you full til lunch! Only 300 calories.
9975 2018-10-07 16:20:25 Peppermint oil, bay leaves, feline intervention, and sealing every hole you can find with spray foam, steel wool and/or caulking.....
9976 2018-10-07 16:20:10 Kasich has got to go.
Once a RINO always a RINO.  Thank God for Trump releasing oil or Ohio and he would be in the dumps.
Bye bye Kasich!

9979 2018-10-07 16:19:43 MidEast oil and arms deals are probably the biggest reasons.
9980 2018-10-07 16:19:43 This B.C. government is causing this problem. Obviously Trudeau is displaying negative constitutional anarchy. He lets B.C. destroy Alberta’s oil from reaching the coast. Trudeau lets em duke it out on the backs of ordinary Canadians!
9981 2018-10-07 16:19:40 prolly just need some oil lol
9982 2018-10-07 16:19:37 어 위치를 저렇게 길게쓸 수가 있어????

9990 2018-10-07 16:18:53 The corrupt republicans are screwing the average working  person. We pay taxes so they can get 1 1/2 trillion dollars of our tax dollars for the wealthy. We fight their wars. We clean up their oil spills. We die because we don’t have affordable healthcare. Ruin their dinner.

9992 2018-10-07 16:18:44 Importing oil from Iran and paying the Iranians in INR instead of in USD. Now, THAT’s gotta butthurt the amreekans.

9994 2018-10-07 16:18:35 Tiket flight December skrg tgh mahal gila esp yg to Europe not just because it's Christmas or Boxing Day or School Holiday

It's also because of the spike in oil prices lately.. brent had touched $86 per barrel

Tu yg tix MAS sampai RM5k utk seat economy cabuk tu
9995 2018-10-07 16:18:31 Interesting to note: In Matt 25:1-13, in the time of the end there a group called Virgins. I believe these to be Christians. All 10 of these Virgins have oil in their lamps to begin with. All 10 fall asleep. Only after the announcement of Christ's coming do the foolish appear.
9996 2018-10-07 16:18:25 what’s the best cream/oil for treating acne?
9997 2018-10-07 16:18:14 I don't see us winning with coal, gas, oil corps telling us what we can & can't do. WI started to allow Solar with Obama rebates. The Walker stopped it!  We're all poorer now. Taxes have gone up.   Yes "Vote like you love your children." 
Voters purged here & WI activists are mak
9998 2018-10-07 16:18:12 Job that pay 7.50 a hour. People working two or three jobs to make ends meet. Gas and oil is up .50. Food is up, cars is up. Goods are up. So, how are people going to make it! Maybe why jobs are at 3.7%. Not making it!!!
9999 2018-10-07 16:17:58 Buhari's corruption drive is essentially about spending Niger Delta oil money.
10000 2018-10-07 16:17:53 Just ask yourself why carter page has been charged with nothing? He was supposedly in colusion with the russians and was going to get 40 billion dollars in oil assets. This guy is so stupid, his mother still ties his shoes
10001 2018-10-07 16:17:47 Men never stop amazing me.... I told this man I needed an oil change two weeks ago....
10002 2018-10-07 16:17:34 2 litres cooking oil $14.50 at Murewa centre
10003 2018-10-07 16:17:17 多分、あろん
10004 2018-10-07 16:17:11 Is this what they mean it will explode if there’s no oil 
10005 2018-10-07 16:17:06 Worldviews rarely spin on a dime (to borrow an Americanism). They're more like oil tankers - lumbering, hard to stop, hard to steer in a new direction. But eventually, given enough facts and a sufficiently hefty dose of reality, some people CAN change. Others, well...
10006 2018-10-07 16:16:56 なんか久し振りに跳び箱跳んだりしたい気分になってきたな
10007 2018-10-07 16:16:53 Karter broke my damn oil burner 
10008 2018-10-07 16:16:43 And we prefer to import it’s oil over using our own.
10009 2018-10-07 16:16:23 Got an oil change today and my car drives like a whole new woman. It’s the little things.

10012 2018-10-07 16:15:55 Yes WE can. 

Dictatorship not needed. This is why WE have a representative democracy... WE have to demand that our representatives listen to US and not the weapons manufacturers and oil tycoons who profit off conflict. We vote out the ones that don't in primaries.
10013 2018-10-07 16:15:38 @INCIndia 
Don't forget UPA govt set the petroleum companies free to increase prices based on international price of crude oil
@RahulGandhi knew it very well the prices had already gone up to more than $100 earlier and it's consequences in advance
 
Concealment & lies galore!
10014 2018-10-07 16:15:37 You don't deserve a rematch and you know it. By the end of he second round you had DOUBT in your eyes. Be humble and go fight in another division. We all know Ferguson would Woop your snake oil salesmen ass.
10015 2018-10-07 16:15:30 All religious things are crap. Whole of the Arab area is nothing without the oil. All the Islamic clerics will definitely try hard to keep your muslim brother in 1400 yrs back. So worry about that.
10016 2018-10-07 16:15:29 If you throw rising oil prices and a weakening JPY onto Japan’s super tight labor market, and fledgling signs of wage growth...you may just (finally) have a credible background for a meaningful inflation uptick in Japan
10017 2018-10-07 16:15:27 Ooooo I would love this. Then I could piss off the locals on dem primary days and during flu season. I live in a strange pocket of conservative, essential oil MLM country.

Metal papers called foil
Man breaks into Burger King and drinks gallons of deep frying oil
10020 2018-10-07 16:15:03 95 Honda Accord for sale. Car runs and drives great. I do 80mph to work everyday. This car runs perfect. Does not burn or leak oil.
