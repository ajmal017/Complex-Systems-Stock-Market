38 2019-06-06 23:45:07 I do want to establish generational wealth and continue to invest in stocks or my kids and their kids
39 2019-06-06 23:44:49 $ZM power candle through $90-$91 and we may see $100 shortly, many expected this stock to be highly overpriced going into earnings. Mark Minervini talks about P/E ratio on huge momentum stocks like Yahoo when it ran over 700%. Stay open minded and trade the trend.
40 2019-06-06 23:44:32 @ShakedownSt @trailrunn3r or the bubble becomes like a helium balloon and just keeps on going producing profits and beating estimates. Most stocks with 52 week highs are all overvalued. This is Wall Street! This is the game
41 2019-06-06 23:43:14 Too busy investing in stocks.
42 2019-06-06 23:42:51 Improvements if possible but not extremely necessary. Stocks: would be nice to be able to switch from % to $ value. Possibly a way to email notepad notes
43 2019-06-06 23:42:21 Investing in stocks                               Savings account                                      Building credit                                          Being a failure will not be a choice.
44 2019-06-06 23:41:24 You can get betw 5 and 7 pct in preferred stocks that tread water around 25.
45 2019-06-06 23:40:37 Also they had few stocks of oil/fuel, especially refined products, because they had been selling the bulk of that to Germany for years.  The last train of tanker cars left in the early morning hours of 22 June 1942. It passed the invading Wehrmacht in the dark. I love irony.
46 2019-06-06 23:40:35 I sorted through all the low vol funds.  They've ballooned up to crazy levels.  Stocks like $CABO year on year with barely changed fundamentals.
47 2019-06-06 23:39:58 Expectation is 175,000. Stocks may like 75,000.
48 2019-06-06 23:37:59 I bet that no matter how heavy he stocks up, this will sell out faaaaaaast!  It's so worth it though. His products are so good.

50 2019-06-06 23:36:03 But why? I want to understand. I own weapons but don't need a silencer... Ever. A silencer isn't a weapon. One can have guns without a silencer or bump stocks.  Not having those things doesn't infringe on our 2nd Amendment.
51 2019-06-06 23:34:04 I rent a house close to your office in Bangkok. The aim was to import your product into Australia and resell to various outlets, as well as selling direct to public. But it's too late now. My money's tied up in stocks.
52 2019-06-06 23:33:25 You do know that you sound like a broken record also on the other side...until someone is being arrested what’s to talk about find something else...How about bump stocks being taken away and now suppressors possibly being taken away after both were only use one time..In a crime.
53 2019-06-06 23:30:26 Absolutely, I think there is a lot of insider training going on in congress! They know that next 10 billion going to a government contractor. Just invest before contract is awarded. Stocks always go up.

59 2019-06-06 23:29:14 @realDonaldTrump dear mr. President please don't take this wrong but if you don't stop messing with second amendment rights such as bump stocks red flag laws and suppressors you're more than likely going to lose 3 to 5 million voters in the next election.
60 2019-06-06 23:26:25 insider trading is illegal. there's so much hype and rumors in this space it's like speculative micro cap bio stocks.

63 2019-06-06 23:25:09 At any time an expert must be able to tell few shares for investment?

When I suggested REC at Rs 90 and PFC at Rs 70, how many invested?

Opportunities do not come everyday or you can not identify every opportunity. 

Still suggest 3 stocks.
1. BSE
2. Hero
3. Sun TV
64 2019-06-06 23:24:51 I still think naming a character "Redan" should get you some kind of time in the stocks. Maybe just a day, but still.

68 2019-06-06 23:22:44 You're trying to ban things that are already banned like bump stocks or AR-15 that weren't even used in the crime how about go after the criminals that commit the crimes and not the tools
69 2019-06-06 23:22:05 Thanks for saying something. Some tweeters don’t like to talk about specific stocks which is confusing to me because talk drives this market not fundamentals. BYND is the best evidence of this fact. 
You’ve already turned me on to two stocks that weren’t on my radar. Cheers!
