41 2018-03-27 21:58:30 Quaint phrasing, but you're either advocating price controls, or a full costing of commodities. Fine. But refusing lawful deliveries of a legal product is neither. Avoiding the reality of your position isn't noble, it's parochial.
42 2018-03-27 21:47:37 Sell HAD a very simple meaning pre-internet. There are instances where 'sell' online does not meet the definition. If I 'sell' on eToro, I am not giving shares to anyone. If I'm sold programmatic ads (where data and placement = commodities) I'm not given data in exchange for £$

48 2018-03-27 21:15:17 Peace & Clarity- A paucity of such commodities is dangerous. Yes, dangerous. It is ever so detrimental to have an intellectual and emotional lucidity.
49 2018-03-27 21:13:44 Interesting views. However, when customers of farm businesses promote their growers to produce more perishable commodities, in an already oversupplied market, contracts or not - prices at farm gate are the first to drop.
50 2018-03-27 21:10:12 These are two non-correlating markets. Retail and cars bearish, commodities (copper, gold, zinc, lead) bullish. UK & US going to create inflation, weaken dollar = commodities rise. But Inflation hurts retail.

54 2018-03-27 20:58:37 back in kini, we used to run commodities around and generally tick over. we asked as a sort of interface between higher security systems and out-and-out anarchy states. this required a bit of bravado but it was our living: most of what we did was (artful) bluffwork and posturing.
55 2018-03-27 20:41:12 Part of the cruelty of the US Narrative is that the individual can do anything. False. And also, the market is not god and people are not commodities.

60 2018-03-27 19:59:30 UD traded weaker throughout the session as commodities slipped across the board (crude, gold, silver all down near enough 1%), but AUD/USD still sits comfortably above last week's lows.
61 2018-03-27 19:58:46 Yes, you are a wild American who firmly believes in an outdated Constitution that was written over 200 years ago. I wonder if you would also like to live w/o the commodities of modern day.  Since you still have that 200 years ago mentally.

64 2018-03-27 19:44:46 Also, the hypocrisy of aid & development workers that are technically migrant workers overseas. But they’re expats who “bring value” (such as inflation in prices like rent & other commodities), while we in Europe and the US want to stop people from those countries to work there!

1) he was a commodities trader, not a banker;
2) he would more than likely argue that the committee was toothless and all decisions are made in the unelected commission

118 2018-03-27 15:09:40 I think the answer is embedded in your question - the superrich mostly don't invest in commodities, so if housing became a commodity, it wouldn't be an attractive investment.

122 2018-03-27 14:56:41 Interesting that the whole piece is based on a fixed income person commenting on a contract in commodities and a physical oil contract that no bank actually trades anymore.
123 2018-03-27 14:50:49 And that our economy has brought us to the point where commodities are on-demand, and completely detached from actual price considerations. (I believe prices are too low on most non-necessity/luxury good <CARS> but that's another thread)

149 2018-03-27 13:27:13 There are some public services that should never ever be driven by a profit motive. Prisons, health care, education. These things are not commodities and privatization only ends in abuse.

151 2018-03-27 13:10:03 There seem to be times when breakevens are failing to predict inflation. It's consistently either hotter and cooler than predicted. So there's some X factor that people don't know about. And this model failure might signal bull and bear markets in commodities.

154 2018-03-27 13:02:56 I guess it's about technicals but also about the contrast between the story and the reality. In the case of gold, those are VERY far apart, so you know it's a short. It's very hard to know what the price of commodities should be unless you're an industry insider, I think.

158 2018-03-27 12:54:22 I take your point, but I've never believed that politicians take letters seriously. I believe that we are but commodities, being returned to a mediaeval feudal system, no NHS, education, die before pension etc....when you back on Richie's show?
159 2018-03-27 12:52:17 What tells you that commodities are a buy? I think I have a handle on when stocks or bonds are a buy but I haven't found a way of predicting commodities prices. Leading indicators of inflation might work as a signal, but maybe not.

230 2018-03-27 05:12:55 It'd be more interesting to know their operational and marketing costs. While I'm sure they're benefiting from economies of scale, I can't help but to think in a near-commodities ops heavy market so reliant on brand, they're likely bleeding money.
231 2018-03-27 05:00:01 Commodities: Rubber +2.28%, Copper +1.50%
232 2018-03-27 04:59:06 Time to Sell Stocks and Buy Gold, Silver and Mining Stocks.....Commodities also

234 2018-03-27 04:11:12 Increasing the price of diesel as suggested by SC will be disastrous on the economy.All commercial vehicles run on diesel and prices of commodities will soar up and charges in public conveyance will sky rocket.

1. Identify products u use everyday or agric commodities
2. Google how much a machine costs to manufacture that product or process commodity
3. Competitor research e.t.c
4. Start w manual machine 

Zimbabwe must industrialize

237 2018-03-27 03:54:05 Afecta a todos, sin importar si es rico o pobre. Hasta ahora, los beneficios de los TLC's son prácticamente nulos. Porque Colombia no exporta nada de valor agregado, sólo commodities.
238 2018-03-27 03:46:33 #MarchForOurJobs Why CAN'T hlthcare workers (4+ M of us) MARCH for US? NOT for patients BUT for US! It is US who others walk ALL OVER, treat as commodities, assault, work w/ unsafe nurse:patient ratios, witness fraud/waste/abuse & the collateral damage, & lose our jobs! It is US!

240 2018-03-27 03:31:26 ¿Qué vamos a hacer con los pronósticos apocalípticos de los genios irrefutables de la economía intergaláctica si se confirman los datos estadísticos que dicen que el desempleo y la pobreza están bajando a niveles que no se veían desde el boom de las commodities?

242 2018-03-27 03:27:38 @ibluckyjoe I do know China gets 60% of US soybeans, not sure about the other commodities
243 2018-03-27 03:17:41 I'm an immigrant and I find your stance offensive. Neither the Indegenous nor the immigrants are commodities for you to trade. Hands off.
244 2018-03-27 03:16:50 #NamiTrade is a decentralized trade exchange that will democratize and revolutionize trading markets, commodities, indices, bonds and crypto-currencies. Very interesting project #nami #ico
245 2018-03-27 02:57:26 Colombia debe dejar de exportar commodities para poder tener una economía fuerte, debe producir elementos elaborados.  El petróleo, el aguacate, el banano, el café, el carbón puros commodities.  Fortalezcan la industria, quiten la carga tributaria a las empresas

250 2018-03-27 02:28:31 Commodities de origen fósil son indispensables para nuestra economía. Tránsito hacia otras fuentes de generación energética son necesarias, pero por su lenta transición no se pueden hacer cambios abruptos. Pertinente incentivar el sector agropecuario por la demanda de alimentos
251 2018-03-27 02:26:27 Isn't it pretty weird/questionable/toxic how we feel (and report) that commodities, purchased articles we use to modify our appearance, make us feel more like ourselves?  Isn't that a sad way to live—chasing a fraudulent authenticity through consumer goods.
252 2018-03-27 02:20:40 PetroYuan is GO!

62,500 contracts worth 27 billion yuan (over $4 billion) were traded involving 62 million barrels of oil

255 2018-03-27 02:07:29 Lion’s Club will be distributing USDA commodities on Wednesday morning March 28th, at 8:30 am.  Meet at Western Plains Apartments to organize the delivery of commodities!
256 2018-03-27 02:02:38 an economy based on the production of commodities for exchange value and the profit motive (capitalism) has no chance of maintaining an earth that is livable for humans
257 2018-03-27 01:58:12 Its been splained to me several times & I'm not sure I still understand it. My wifes cousin does bitcoin mining so its always a hot topic. I prefer traditional commodities like rhino semen

260 2018-03-27 01:29:54 I am unconstrained, dynamic, and flexible. 

I'm willing to go long or short stocks, rates, commodities, currency, or volatility. 

I apply systems for directional trends and countertrends across varied time frames.
261 2018-03-27 01:26:44 Well articulated Matt!
Prob is people get excitable by irrational exuberance.
Tomatoes from Mrehwa in current form are a commodity.U don't need air transportation to move commodities.
Let's get the basics right..
262 2018-03-27 01:07:58 I'm definitely not supportive. I think it treats children like commodities and yeah more western middle caste consumers? Not a good idea.
263 2018-03-27 01:01:27 Seriously? The Dow is on a downward trajectory today's dead cat bounce was expected @themmagraham it's a strong dollar policy and rotation at the best to finance & commodities. I can speak financial markets as well @richardbranson @KatrinaNation @taylorswift13 @DanicaPatrick
264 2018-03-27 00:56:51 2/2: the takeaway from Fed Powel, USTR Lighthizer, & Commerce Sec Ross testimony - any commodities coming in US, foreign/US mfg offshore - made of alum/steel will pay comenserate tariffs to level playing field. Rest is market forces working their will, ie, thriving competition

267 2018-03-27 00:55:19 They will choose to tariff fragile commodities like apples so that the waste will be visible....You can only freeze pork for so long.
268 2018-03-27 00:52:19 The denial is astounding.   Commodities can be traded by brokers, so transitioning to broker status works in both circumstances.  Which, of course, would also mean protecting investors with best execution, Fair & Orderly markets, etc...
269 2018-03-27 00:42:28 I agree with you Jay, we've had nothing like the early/mid 70s. The rush of money into commodities in the mid-2000s had similar implications, but had a different structure. But there has been nothing like the "Wild West" in the 70s grain trade...
270 2018-03-27 00:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
271 2018-03-27 00:25:16 30% aumentó la demanda de profesionales del sector minero en el Norte de nuestro país, durante el primer trimestre del 2018.  
Esta alza tiene relación con el aumento del precio de los commodities y la recuperación de la economía. #economia #CHILE
