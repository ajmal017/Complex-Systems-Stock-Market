50 2018-11-05 23:56:08 Every Norwegian is valued at $195,000 thanks to North Sea Oil. The Norwegian Oil Fund owns 1.3% of global stocks and shares, making it the world's largest sovereign wealth fund. Labour and the Tories gave the people nada but the oil companies were given big tax breaks.
51 2018-11-05 23:56:03 Palm oil is what Walgreens is good at, greasing the palms of the stockholders while keeping half the bonuses of the store mgrs and rxms. GREAT company.

As to the countryside, much of that belongs to our native population.
None of this is a mountain out of a molehill. Do your research.
61 2018-11-05 23:54:30 Bottom line: the Republican Party  denies, dismisses and down plays global warming.

65 2018-11-05 23:53:33 A lot of the ones I know do. Not all of them were taught that it actually needs to be done as bad oil can gum up valves and everything leading to oil not distributing causing grinding in gears which leads to added wear and tear

80 2018-11-05 23:51:26 not if it's JIF or SKIPPY or something, hell no.  but if it's  natural and the oil separates, then yes it does help to keep it in the fridge.

109 2018-11-05 23:47:51 That looks easier than the way I've always done it, which is with oil on a medium  burner, wiping it every couple of minutes to keep the coating even. It works, but takes a lot of paper towels and involves risk of burns.

140 2018-11-05 23:45:14 How convenient for Russia and our lawmakers with Russian investments in oil.
141 2018-11-05 23:45:13 Put some tea tree oil on it and a bandaid
142 2018-11-05 23:45:10 Efficascent oil
143 2018-11-05 23:45:05 Remember change the oil, fuel, transmission & air filters. They are important to preserve the engine #CarMaintenanceTips @renoomokri pls #RT
144 2018-11-05 23:44:59 Trump’s rallies prove he’s just like a traveling snake oil salesman trying to sell a magic potion that costs an exorbitant amount of money for empty promises.
145 2018-11-05 23:44:51 Y’all out here having these marriages that don’t last as long as an oil change
146 2018-11-05 23:44:28 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
147 2018-11-05 23:44:27 How long after your car tells you you need an oil change do actually have to get an oil change? Asking for a friend
148 2018-11-05 23:44:26 Like how she has Germany undermine allies by making deals with Russian oil companies that line her own pockets.
149 2018-11-05 23:44:26 Whose EPL? Whose oil?  Whose gas? Extractive sector agreements are never good for the host. (NGEZI) What is our share of this find as a country. Are shares in Invictus available to me as a Zimbabwean? Only Invictus stands to benefit, Zimbabwe will get its 5% royalties at most.
150 2018-11-05 23:44:21 Lmfao bet ima cop this kind cause the castor oil
151 2018-11-05 23:44:17 My daddy taught me how to change tires , brakes, check my oil , etc. ! I’m really self sufficient honestly
152 2018-11-05 23:44:10 Nope it’s not the same thing  Miracle Whip is made from water, soybean oil, high-fructose corn syrup, vinegar, modified corn starch, eggs, salt, natural flavor, mustard flour, potassium sorbate, paprika, spice, and dried garlic.
153 2018-11-05 23:44:09 Everybody should be careful with each other because both of people (or one of them) might be severely hurt inside,don't forget to heal the wound, not to put oil into the fire.
154 2018-11-05 23:44:06 I've seen it all now, my Mrs has a cold so in bed she stuck sanitary towel to the wall covered in obus oil.
155 2018-11-05 23:44:01 Sorry the source line was missing in that chart. I'll alert the editors on that. Yes it's EIA data. And the bottom chart (the one you're asking about) is imports of "crude oil and petroleum products."
156 2018-11-05 23:43:50 NNPC cost of production has reduced but it hasn't affect the common man on the  street. If the cost has reduced & it doesn't affect the general public then what's the reduction all about? Are they refining crude oil at a reduced cost so we can buy it cheaper cost?
157 2018-11-05 23:43:49 まざまざ
158 2018-11-05 23:43:41 Y trill sammy look like penzoil high mileage vehicle motor oil with active cleansing agents.
159 2018-11-05 23:43:32 agreed, though a trade's a trade =)  i was one of the rare people bullish on oil on it's rise up and shorted it partially on the way down.  2 hr chart is showing a double bottom.

161 2018-11-05 23:43:27 Hi does CBD oil help with headaches?
162 2018-11-05 23:43:10 A republiCANT said to me, “we can just go into Saudi Arabia & take all the oil because we sold it to them.” WTF? From what reservoir, Niagra Falls? The ignorance is real! #Trumpers
163 2018-11-05 23:42:59 Oil and CL aren’t a good combination after all
164 2018-11-05 23:42:48 Theories isn't proven science. Did you know that North America was under a glacier that melted before the dinosaurs? We have crude oil in the ground proving it. Fossil fuels never existed. This is why your carbon tax is ridiculous. It's a scam.
165 2018-11-05 23:42:36 The hoses, the radiator, heater core, water pump, thermostat housing, head gasket, freeze plugs, automatic transmission oil cooler, cylinder head(s) and block.
166 2018-11-05 23:42:33 We all celebrated when Trudeau was elected PM, but while he's #progressive on many social issues, he's a Koch brother on filthy Tar Sands oil and the #KeystoneXLPipeline.
167 2018-11-05 23:42:32 Far from 1% here....take-home pay went up after the bill passed, so I will gladly keep those "crumbs". Do these whiny wealthy people even research this matter?
168 2018-11-05 23:42:27 Imagine if Alberta invested $300 million into #Blockchain and #cryptocurrency.  @atbfinancial and I could have turned it into $1 billion with #XRP.  Instead my province wants to spend it on the Olympics.  By the way our unemployment is 7.9% and oil is under $80 A barrel.
169 2018-11-05 23:42:24 it’s not that simple! All natural Peanut Butter goes in the fridge because the oil separates. Regular doesn’t,so in cupboard
170 2018-11-05 23:42:21 Here's my question to #Florida  about the oddness of the ballot having oil rigs paired with vaping. My question is wtf?  #Midterms2018

175 2018-11-05 23:41:21 Bought a @TroyBilt lawnmower in September. Used 4 times. 5th time, plume of smoke, oil out of exhaust, will not crank. Lost receipt, I now have large lawn ornament.
176 2018-11-05 23:41:16 I’ve gotten used to it now; but agreed it’s not the best smelling oil
177 2018-11-05 23:40:58 How many of those did the Obama regime lock up. Why would they vote for snake oil salesman like you anyway?
178 2018-11-05 23:40:43 They called it high mileage oil and daddy said that was unnecessary and they did that to overcharge me lol
179 2018-11-05 23:40:40 I use this oil jjgbnjh idk if you have it tho
180 2018-11-05 23:40:39 1) Nail Polish Remover (i.e. acetate)

Ты прекрасна, хотя тебе это может так и не казаться... Так что не нужно так грустить.
194 2018-11-05 23:38:32 @asemota in Akwa Ibom, there's a much to choose from. There's Atama, Afang, Editan, draw soup (okro & Ogbono), Abak (palm oil soup), fisherman soup, vegetable (pumpkin leaf). There's Ekpang Nkukwo, Nditod (aubergine stew).... Worth a visit at the very least. I'll host you.
Aj.
195 2018-11-05 23:38:17 The people who get married at 20 are the same people who post on facebook asking where a good place is to get an oil change
196 2018-11-05 23:38:12 Nope. I live in rural new Mexico and the northern part of the state (Santa Fe etc) rules the state. They look down us as bitter clingers and only want us for our billions of oil dollars we send them.
197 2018-11-05 23:38:07 the best way to quantify my net worth would be kegs of peanut oil...conservative estimates put me at 10 kegs but i could be wrong
198 2018-11-05 23:38:07 Yorkshire Pudding: Add 4 pinches of fish oil, 1/4 tsp of beer & 1/3 tbsp of egg substitute to a cake pan. Microwave for 10 sec and enjoy!
199 2018-11-05 23:38:06 Cream is prolly a different lubricant. 
Like lotions vs coconut oil or none. Free jacking off.
200 2018-11-05 23:37:59 Yes. Then one year he made the hole bigger, added a bit of 3-in-1 oil to the nail and hey presto! I still remember that well. Good times.

204 2018-11-05 23:37:43 An excellent choice. My wife uses several types of oil like that. I tend to use Noni juice. That can be used externally or internally. (warning: tastes like ruined prune juice)   
205 2018-11-05 23:37:36 Jack Black beard oil

211 2018-11-05 23:36:49 @mhineidi I know Syria doesn’t have oil but chances of big  regional conflict is huge now there.
212 2018-11-05 23:36:47 Rather them be away from their families on American soil,fighting for us, instead of oil schmuck
213 2018-11-05 23:36:39 I sure hope not! The shakers are oil, vinegar, and Italian herbs! They are inside shaker bottles and spice shakers, so we call them.... Shakers.
214 2018-11-05 23:36:39 It's always interesting to chat with our customers. One woman bought another 'resti+' organic essential oil roll-on...saying that she applies it to her anxious dog at bedtime, & he now settles & goes to sleep immediately.

218 2018-11-05 23:36:24 Ok, so if producing pil does what you say, why is the west texas ground not constantly shaking and fire spewing from every faucet within a 500 mile radius? Seriously, TX is the 4th largest producer of oil on earth, so what you say should be being reported constantly, why isnt it?
219 2018-11-05 23:36:24 Reminds me to check my oil 
220 2018-11-05 23:36:17 No, they think we WE are really stupid.  Hillary said so.  Snake oil salesmen.
221 2018-11-05 23:36:17 I was driving that oil wagon when i passed by a direction sign and that john guy hit his head and just flew away lol.

225 2018-11-05 23:35:16 Invictus has discovered potential oil nd gas reserves on a block previously owned by Mobil after the expiry of Mobil's EPL. My question is who owns the oil nd gas? Answer, not Zimbabwe.
226 2018-11-05 23:34:55 @mhineidi went up a lot today. The situation in Idlib Syria will spark at anytime too. Oil will be $100

233 2018-11-05 23:34:20 “Well, if I may be so bold, it’s about time you started getting along. The two of you are like oil and water! I was considering resorting to drastic measures, you know.”

Can't wait to try them!
240 2018-11-05 23:33:31 Will #UAE stop buying #Iran oil now that sanctions are back on? Anyone? How does that line up a their rhetoric?
241 2018-11-05 23:33:27 It amazes me to see that 80% of the people working in Oil Sands projects and operations are out-of-province people. The very same people whose families and friends oppose the pipelines.
242 2018-11-05 23:33:26 The Americans don’t need Iran’s oil. Europe does.
243 2018-11-05 23:33:21 This is actually easily explained as the more “educated” means the more time you’ve spent in college, i.e. in democratic ecochambers being brainwashed.

246 2018-11-05 23:33:11 Dems used to fight for blue collar workers. Come to our building sites, our union halls. They left us way before we left them. Now they sneer at us and look down on our professions. I’d love to see them build a truck, change oil, or even mow a lawn.
247 2018-11-05 23:33:10 What a sad state of affairs that in this day and age, with the technology we have available...that any fossil fuel industry is "flourishing."  We need to stop feeding the leeches that own those corporations. Oil use is filthy, dangerous and IMMORAL. #SolarEnergy #WindEnergy

254 2018-11-05 23:32:09 Know your history. Dem House in 09 passed a historic climate bill and @GOP demagogued on it to win the House in 2010. @GOP bought by Big Oil

256 2018-11-05 23:31:47 You need an oil change, kid. And a tune-up.
257 2018-11-05 23:31:41 I'm still not sure why you thought olive oil was an analogous substitute for Heavy Cream....
258 2018-11-05 23:31:31 Truth be told, if the world was at the precipice of no return, world governments would band together to find a viable green solution to replace our oil based economy. Their not. Instead we impose a nonsensical Carbon tax that does nothing for the environment.  Hmmmmmm?
259 2018-11-05 23:31:20 Yes. People are realizing you are a con man and we don’t want your snake oil anymore. It’s making America sick.
260 2018-11-05 23:31:17 How does that work? My tax cut goes to the 1%?

Really this is fun but it's also a little sad to think your level of knowledge on the oilsands and the energy industry in general is probably about par for those protesting against it.
274 2018-11-05 23:29:06 I like that Beto isn’t bought out by lobbyists and big oil and pharma his campaign was funded by his voters. I Beto supports legalization of marijuana while I don’t smoke its medicinal benefits are amazing... especially for soldiers who suffer from PTSD

281 2018-11-05 23:27:21 Start ez ~ Oven Baked Lemon Pepper tilapia

375° for 18m
-Foil
-Olive Oil
-Talapia

Place filet in foil after thawing
apply oil to cover the whole filet apply a light yet firm coat of lemon pepper to each fish.

I prefer pairing asparagus and rice but broccoli and rice will do

283 2018-11-05 23:27:15 @mhineidi Now he is saying Oil will crash. He is probably works with short hedges fund
284 2018-11-05 23:27:14 Not to mention he won the French, reached the semis at the US Open & Wimbledon and the quarters in Australia. Meaning he lost all of one match outside of a major. Outstanding doesn't even do it justice. #Nadal
285 2018-11-05 23:27:14 I recently started using a products from farasali sold online & at Sephora, it’s an oil treatment called “volcanic elixir” that specially targets breaks & it’s been soooo good! Search it, it might help both of you has so many good reviews
286 2018-11-05 23:27:13 It depends on if you mean the oil needs to be changed or if there is no oil at all
287 2018-11-05 23:27:11 You too paid for an oil change eh?
288 2018-11-05 23:27:10 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
289 2018-11-05 23:27:09 oil let me join Pz as a trick shooter nah I am just playing but least he shoot is shot though

291 2018-11-05 23:26:55 the oil expensive tho.
292 2018-11-05 23:26:37 Playing them like a fiddle...remove sanctions and give us good faith free tanker loads of heating oil and let your own people freeze like BushII did...

298 2018-11-05 23:25:52 google "tar sands" and all you see for the most part is links to Alberta's tarsands. what's more, all the oil shills who whine about what you call them still know what we're talking about. so it's a non-issue
299 2018-11-05 23:25:44 Yeah, we’re a little upset about oil pipelines running over the largest aquifer on earth. An old navy saying is true, a drop of engine oil will contaminate the whole ship’s supply of water. That aquifer supplies millions of cubic meters of water to our agricultural industry
300 2018-11-05 23:25:43 Really? I’ve heard good things.. ice hit the oil defuser going at night. Not sure how much it works
301 2018-11-05 23:25:20 Sadly, there is such thing as too much truffle oil.

306 2018-11-05 23:24:56 Energy East could take it to OUR refineries. We have absolutely no need for oil from anywhere else. We should be refining everything we need and shipping the excess off both coasts.
307 2018-11-05 23:24:55 Actually that is exactly what they think.
308 2018-11-05 23:24:38 Recession might happen regardless, for reasons beyond the control of any Coloradan or any American. If OPEC reduces production and U.S. shale in N.D./Texas can't keep up its drilling pace, oil prices could spike. 10 of the last 11 U.S. recessions were preceded by a price surge.

310 2018-11-05 23:24:36 Like maybe we just sell very fine olive oil, for example.
311 2018-11-05 23:24:22 We would recommend that you add one drop of an essential oil or baby oil to the dried Dipbrow Pomade. Also always twist the cap tightly when you put it back on and store the Pomade with the cap-side down. These tips will help prevent the Pomade from drying out.
312 2018-11-05 23:24:14 attempted to burn up the midnight oil writing my paper but was slow and uncreative... in the end i took a nap, woke up at sunrise and i was refuelled wow guess sleep really helps....
313 2018-11-05 23:24:04 Olive oil is perfect. You can add chili powder to it...
314 2018-11-05 23:24:02 Closed the Coffee trade for a 40 pip loss and we have stopped trading commodities altogether. They have become very unpredictable (apart from maybe oil).
315 2018-11-05 23:24:00 What a crock of bull crap. Since the NDP has come into power our debt has soared, more public sector employees have been hired, unemployment is greater than eight percent and oil and gas investors are leaving the province.
316 2018-11-05 23:23:41 まぁわからんでもないw
317 2018-11-05 23:23:35 What do you mean the oil part doesnt matter  you cant drive a car without oil lol ask @PatrickMoyer1 who blew his engine up that way

319 2018-11-05 23:23:18 @Jaclynhill tea tree oil for piercings is a life saver!!!!
320 2018-11-05 23:23:18 getting an oil change is so stressful i promise you i will never do it again
321 2018-11-05 23:23:15 I couldn't really find I way but I heard that rubbing a certain oil everyday helps

But I never tried seemed like a fib to me
322 2018-11-05 23:23:13 Wasn't it the lead singer from midnight oil that called you a twat in parliament?
323 2018-11-05 23:23:10 Then why are they keeping quiet because they want to continue the looting and stealing of #Biafra oil and gas the world is wicked why should they hide such information from the public it shall never be well  with all of them iseeeeeeeee

325 2018-11-05 23:23:04 Olive oil :) as a moisturizer. it also helps keep the pimples away.
326 2018-11-05 23:23:03 I love the electric scooters... just dropped my car of at Kwik Kar for oil change, took it to Trader Joe’s to get some chicken, then road home. Will take it again in a minute to go pick up my car.
327 2018-11-05 23:23:03 Not worth the trees and barrels of oil
Not when Mt Smart is available
328 2018-11-05 23:23:02 And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.

En Foz do Iguaçu
Pasó de valer 3,60 reales hace unos días, la semana pasada a 3,47 y hoy a 3,30. Esto equivale a 32.50 el gas oil cuando en Misiones vale 38.
Y eso que Brasil tiene menos autoabastecimiento que Argenti…
334 2018-11-05 23:22:24 However, AL will be one of the last like we are in everything else. If you don't understand what CBD oil can do and you or a loved one suffer from 1 of the 1000s of illnesses that it can help you with please do some homework. You will be amazed.
335 2018-11-05 23:22:15 Go to Trader Joe's and get the butternut squash Pre-cut in a bag. Pre-heat oven to 400. Put squash in baggie with olive oil and shake up. Then put on baking sheet with foil sprayed with non-stick stuff. Season with salt and pepper and bake for 25 minutes
336 2018-11-05 23:22:05 psh change the oil and call 'er a day

338 2018-11-05 23:22:00 The ones saying Mashallah aren’t seeing the true beauty but the pumping of oil wealth and desecration of holy sight. Signs of the time.
339 2018-11-05 23:21:50 Lemon pepper chicken with artichokes and green olives sautéed in butter and olive oil
340 2018-11-05 23:21:45 I find it is, though I used the strongest oil my little jrt could have for her epilepsy to ensure the best and fastest absorption.  It’s available it various strengths and flavours so the one you use should have a vape equivalent
341 2018-11-05 23:21:43 Zeros will cook white and use the remaining Ingredients to prepare sauce.
Finish the sauce and sleep off.
When you come back, you wouldn't even have Pepper and oil to eat the white rice.

355 2018-11-05 23:19:52 Very versatile but I’d say get a few zucchini and yellow squash. Cut them into round slices and cook in a pan on the stove in olive oil with some onion that is cut up but not like chopped to bits until soft. With like salt and pepper.
356 2018-11-05 23:19:45 It makes a great all purpose cleaner around the house with a few drops of scented oil too.
357 2018-11-05 23:19:43 That thing needa oil change soon so don’t blow it 
358 2018-11-05 23:19:27 Oil, gas pipelines, the military industrial complex, and Israel’s desire to expand. Afghanistan has lithium and poppies. That’s why.

412 2018-11-05 23:11:28 We were talking about this the other night. We had a track outside the wall, inside the wire at my FOB that ran through our burn pit. I can literally still smell it, 14 years later. I also remember the oil well fires in Kuwait in 1991. One of them is bound to get me.
413 2018-11-05 23:11:13 Maybe its good for some, but honeybunch, I'm not experiencing a boom. Higher heating oil, 65% increase in health ins premiums, higher groceries,  gas close to $3.00 a gallon. And let's not forget the huge hit my poor retirement account took the other day.  #voteblue
414 2018-11-05 23:11:08 wait, yes, you are right of course I meant cheap oil bad for nuclear
415 2018-11-05 23:11:04 Try doing an oil wash first then washing with soap. How strong were these fucking peppers?
416 2018-11-05 23:11:03 Voted already on Saturday afternoon while my car was getting its oil changed. Walked to/from the voting center. Took 30 minutes. The oil change took longer. #noexcuses #VoteBlue
417 2018-11-05 23:10:54 Finally changed my oil after who knows how long 
418 2018-11-05 23:10:45 そりゃそうだ。(笑)
419 2018-11-05 23:10:45 I think we can all agree that when it comes to Canadian exports, it’s

424 2018-11-05 23:10:16 "He doesn't have the right" He's comedian and comedians don't give immunity to anyone. I thought your veterans were fighting for freedom, freedom of expression which includes comedians (as opposed to what they're actually fight for: stealing natural resources, oil from countries)

437 2018-11-05 23:08:37 This isn't going to age well. They way he dismisses the external influences into Brexit and Trump like they aren't important (he wants it to be about a populist uprising) when really it's the mega rich/far-right who support oil & gas and generally want to erode human rights.
438 2018-11-05 23:08:36 بعد التحذيرات الجوية بإستمرار تقلبات الطقس إلى ساعات الصباح الباكر.. أولياء أمور الطلبة يطالبون وزارة التربية من خلال مواقع التواصل الإجتماعي لجعل يوم الغد عطلة رسمية حماية لأبنائهم.

И что мне делать, выкладывать, или ещё раз завтра перепроверить?
440 2018-11-05 23:08:35 They (U.S) gave special waiver, to India, to import oil from Iran. Why? Because it needs someone in this region as an Ally against China and to keep Pakistan in check. North Korea is its Scarecrow against South Korea, another emerging economy.
Trump knows Business!
441 2018-11-05 23:08:35 そだよーーーーーｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ
442 2018-11-05 23:08:32 No? If oil is >100$ nuclear plants are not economical is what I meant. Oil above 100 dollars, idk, maybe I am just confused here but it made sense to me
443 2018-11-05 23:08:23 They are the best fries though. It's the machine. And oil that is REGULARLY cleaned
444 2018-11-05 23:08:15 Not a dude first of all, you just stay in school a bit longer you need to bake a bit more.  I realize that you want to mix the two as one but that is oil and water, not going to happen.
445 2018-11-05 23:08:09 Denounce of the entire nation will bring continuance of wars promised.  Sanctions of oil and migration of the royals into the missle field.

457 2018-11-05 23:06:51 The grudge fight was only hours away and the nerves were kicking in as she packed her bag before heading to the venue. In it she carefully placed her brand new red boxing gloves and boots, white underpants and oil. That’s all she would need 
458 2018-11-05 23:06:48 I’m just scared for people who wear heavy makeup and take it off with wipes instead of an oil cleanse.

464 2018-11-05 23:06:12 Oil. 
It goes all the way back to the waning years of the Ottoman Empire and WWI, when the US' sole envoy for the entire Middle East was William Yale, who was working at the same time for Standard Oil of NY as for the State Dept and the British (who take a lot of blame too).
465 2018-11-05 23:05:54 Well, I don't know how to put this......this is a topic that is too hard to discuss on twitter. I am not commenting on BBD oil b/c I am not informed on the subject. I never...ever...read articles like this b/c they are of zero value. 1/2
466 2018-11-05 23:05:49 Don’t blame the tax, blame the oil corporations who want more profits
467 2018-11-05 23:05:43 I went to church and got some blessed oil put on me yesterday cus this aint it

470 2018-11-05 23:05:29 Actually, check your facts. We exported more oil under Obama than George W.
471 2018-11-05 23:05:06 You should switch soaps I guess? I use argan oil or charcoal based bar soaps to feel good and smell rustic yet clean.
472 2018-11-05 23:05:04 Don’t worry.... trump’s plan to roll back fuel efficiency (to sell more oil) will only make things worse.
473 2018-11-05 23:04:55 They say that can be super dangerous for the baby . I know a few people that told their dr that they took castor oil and the dr got the baby out immediately like that day

476 2018-11-05 23:04:48 Raisin and Sultana are both the same grape. Raisin dried naturally.  Sultana using oil or something.  Currants are dead woodlice - avoid all food containing those bad boys.

478 2018-11-05 23:04:46 I find name calling to be unuseful. I prefer building bridges where possible.
The economics of these #pipelines are dubious. I’m all for using energy from Canadian sources to bring us independence from #Saudi #oil

480 2018-11-05 23:04:45 None of that does any good if you vote for politicians that are going to what oil companies continue to extract fossil fuels.
481 2018-11-05 23:04:37 But what about oil and coal? Are you turning your back on Alaska’s big energy producers? And the thousands of jobs they provide?
482 2018-11-05 23:04:34 Going grocery shopping with my mom is the best. Everything I needed, she had at home. You need eggs? I just bought a double pack. Oil? Which kind? I have the olive/grape seed at home. Adobo? Chicken? I got it all

487 2018-11-05 23:03:56 The museum staff are taking advantage of the new floor space during the redesign.

This protest banner was made in 1989, after the devastation of the Exxon Valdez oil spill. The paintings of animals covered in oil still remind us how important protecting our wildlife is today.
488 2018-11-05 23:03:45 Might have something to do with drinking from the pond with all that oil/ petrol in it from the cars sticking out of it
489 2018-11-05 23:03:40 Always stunning when you read the comments and oil is mentioned. People actually believe that the history of this struggle began with oil.
490 2018-11-05 23:03:39 Still the snake oil salesman, he hasn't changed one iota.
491 2018-11-05 23:03:36 Good move no chairs in a small room.

493 2018-11-05 23:03:19 If my wife was pregnant, I’d be the guy to come home from work just so I can tell her to sit down while I do everything, and massage her feet with a little warm water and scented oil.
494 2018-11-05 23:03:19 It’s probably a synthetic oil

510 2018-11-05 23:01:50 And ignore the vast amounts of “oil money” invested across the world in non oil assets
511 2018-11-05 23:01:42 I really do love the way people look at me when I have the hood on my car popped and I’m checking my oil. Yes y’all, I actually know what I’m doing and I’m not just jacking around with my car.

533 2018-11-05 22:59:27 Simple is the operative word in this debate.

Of course they're not in debt, they're bank rolled by oil rich Arabs.

Is that something you feel proud of 

I'd rather be proud of a well run club who make money the hard way aka Spurs, Arsenal or even Utd who's been exploited.

537 2018-11-05 22:59:08 Go back to the Eurostat data for the UK. Is it really true that people in North East Scotland are wealthier generally than people in Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire? Or does the chart show NE Scotland has high per capita GDP because that's where the oil comes ashore?
538 2018-11-05 22:59:06 China India Taiwan Italy to name four,  all 8 equal 3/4 of the oil that Iran exports.

546 2018-11-05 22:58:31 quick lesson in geo-politics children: if Iran so much as drops on mine in the Gulf, the US and its allies can and do have a plan to get oil to the world. It will almost certainly mean the end of the Iranian regime. If you love freedom and hate fascism, you should be OK with that

552 2018-11-05 22:57:44 AFTER NOV 5: Iran's October #oil exports were 1.6 million b/d according to our pals at @TankerTrackers. State Dept deals with Big 3 (China, India & Turkey) to reduce imports likely means #Iran oil exports in November will be close to 1.2 million b/d.

562 2018-11-05 22:57:02 You somehow emerged from your education as a free thinker.  Given the hold that progressive politics have taken on our education system (literally from K through grad or professional school), that is increasingly rare result
563 2018-11-05 22:56:59 WELL SMEAR MY ASS WITH TRUFFLE OIL AND CALL YOURSELF ALEX GUARNASCHELLI,
564 2018-11-05 22:56:53 We need more stringent government regulation of these snake oil salesmen that “the market” is allowing to run rampant. I am sure you agree John.
565 2018-11-05 22:56:53 Nope. Not asking the same woman who makes squirrel oil and raccoon knees.

567 2018-11-05 22:56:46 That's the point, should suffering be synonymous with Nigerians. A poor American with a daily wage can conveniently afford this... Think bigger bro! Nigeria can do better. We are the 6th oil producing nation in the world

575 2018-11-05 22:55:28 A nice facial oil is actually a great alternative as a base for your makeup. Especially if you are using a lot of matte based products, it helps to prevent that cake face and ashy look. Oil is actually great for oily & acne prone skin

692 2018-11-05 22:42:31 Seriously the nation need to wake up and make education in it's rightful position, because a fresh graduate in the teaching profession is way more than a fresh graduate in the oil industry if they cannot earn the same or even more I think the disparity should be minimal

698 2018-11-05 22:41:45 I welcome that the US has finally reimposed all Iranian sanctions, however allowing eight countries to continue importing oil is injecting new blood in regimes vain. No compromise should be made! @AmbJohnBolton @SecPompeo

702 2018-11-05 22:41:22 That oil money we dig that
703 2018-11-05 22:41:21 Well I know because the reason my country became successful was because we made a deal with them during the 1960-> and traded our wood products for their oil and such. I mean there was corruption back then, but they are what ultimately lead to us becoming successful.

705 2018-11-05 22:40:54 Pharrell is suing Trump for playing ‘happy’ at a rally the day after the synagogue massacre. I suspect Midnight Oil might also object to SloMo leveraging their Australiana.

Disappointing that SloMo doesn’t have “Know Your Enemy” on the jukebox.
706 2018-11-05 22:40:54 So, you are saying the snake oil he is selling is a placebo?
707 2018-11-05 22:40:48 i wonder if theres a way to make weed oil infused deviled egg edibles
708 2018-11-05 22:40:48 And the most educated can't change the oil in the car. Or do many practical things. The most educated can't grow or harvest food. I'd think bout that one... a lot.
709 2018-11-05 22:40:42 oil is a commodity responsible for inflation, when oil collapses usually there are no bounces...

717 2018-11-05 22:39:51 What does the coconut oil do?
718 2018-11-05 22:39:51 Yes, that’s why iPhone sales decreased during 2008, right? Now consider this: what if high oil prices cause the next recession? Some people won’t be able to afford NOT to buy a Tesla.
719 2018-11-05 22:39:49 Maybe Paypal should start closing the accounts of people who work in palm oil, or petrochemical extraction. You know, the industries that are actually destroying our planet's capacity to support human life.

729 2018-11-05 22:38:50 Sure. And you should vote for the (de-carbonizing) Alberta oil sands displacing heavy crudes from places like Venezuela that have an even higher carbon-intensity. "No heavy crudes consumed" is not on the ballot.

734 2018-11-05 22:37:49 Markets and dictate their wills before they were unseated by competition. That said every business combination from steal to oil that became a MARKET monopoly for a time LOWERED prices. The same goes for the products coming out of the least regulated industry today: tech

758 2018-11-05 22:35:58 I was getting huge cystic acne on my mid 30’s. Probably due to hormones, but I’ve been predominantly clear for years after switching to three things:
Cetaphil cleanser,
Cerave moisturizer,
And coconut oil under the eyes.
It’s all I use.
759 2018-11-05 22:35:58 Cool I’ll mix and attempt a hot oil treatment
760 2018-11-05 22:35:56 Welp fuck me, I figured out why my damn car keeps needing oil  the power steering pressure line hose is fucked 
761 2018-11-05 22:35:49 Hear hear, our neighbour sells organic hams and cheeses, olive oil, wines...he sources all his ingredients from Tuscany. No idea what's going to happen with their business if Brexit happens.
762 2018-11-05 22:35:42 I agree! @votelau is a oil sands and pipeline hater. Boot him Mad Max...
763 2018-11-05 22:35:32 By the time we have the technology to invade we will probably be off an oil based economy.

770 2018-11-05 22:35:11 Trump has to issue exemptions to the Iran oil embargo... he is scared that his actions would increase oil price too much and affect election results.   Shame that the US did that unilaterally with no international support, other than Saudi Arabia and Israel.
771 2018-11-05 22:35:09 Do you know what my chances at IRGC strategy consulting are with a 3.1 gpa from a semi target? Better or worse exit oops than Syrian army prop oil trading? Also, any views on how Iranian Air Force transports compare to united premium economy?

778 2018-11-05 22:34:32 Ummm I change my own oil thank you very much
779 2018-11-05 22:34:16 I’m not sure how does it profit Delhi because it’s a partner with Iran & Afghanistan at the Chabahar port project, and its a major importer of oil from Iran. In fact, it’s Pakistan that refuses to take any oil from Iran.
780 2018-11-05 22:33:54 The Trump Regime and the GOP are pushing us to war to help the murderous dictatorship of Saudi Arabia and satisfy Netanyahu’s paranoia. But I’m sure Big Oil has their hand in this also.

785 2018-11-05 22:33:13 Indeed. Rain the swamp of these corporate lobbyists & their distortions.
How come profitable oil companies got more handouts from oil royalties than Albertans?
786 2018-11-05 22:32:52 Oh great ... more oil and plastics... pollution and suffering ... how short sighted are we ?
787 2018-11-05 22:32:47 #IranSanctions -- #Trump can say what he wants but the oil price will rise because #Iran oil price is lower than those of the #UAE, #SaudiArabia.

796 2018-11-05 22:31:53 I thought they had rivers of oil.. Such a shame 
797 2018-11-05 22:31:49 For a nation such as Japan I can see the advantages. The value would be very different for each country but the logic will be the same.
1. Least eff. coal plants. 2. Least eff. oil plants 3. Least eff gas plants...and so on. Once those are done then there is value.
798 2018-11-05 22:31:43 Before I go to sleep, I’d like to say that calling City “Arab money” or “oil money” is not insulting at all. That’s what we are. And we are proud of it. I rather watch us make money through legitimate business than borrowing money from the bank like United. Good night.

801 2018-11-05 22:31:24 Since we're on the topic, Dmac, have you read anything, or do you have an opinion about the potential health benefits of CBD oil? 
 
It seems to be all the rage these days with some folks.
802 2018-11-05 22:31:06 Your anxiety is too high! if you can’t find a hobby or go to therapy. get you a weighted blanket, some good rest tea or oil to help an hour before you lay down! 
803 2018-11-05 22:31:05 @othereconomist Or...

The entire Arabian peninsula, their regional allies, the remaining economic weight of oil, and Israel too. US and ME - two of the four most critical regional (the EU and China as 3&4) nodes with China on both sides and Europe truly alone.
804 2018-11-05 22:30:45 @Petro_Matad #MATD 
Based on seismic photos I expect this to be big gas + oil reserve.
805 2018-11-05 22:30:44 That's not true sir, where are the road he built? If you had said he got more  oil revenue than any other president  I will agree
806 2018-11-05 22:30:36 ISTANBUL — Iran’s military forces staged war exercises and its president defiantly vowed Monday to “break” U.S. sanctions on oil sales that were reimposed at midnight, as Tehran resisted a Trump administration pressure campaign aimed at isolating the country economically.
807 2018-11-05 22:30:36 Thats like 10M calories, might as well just drank a bottle of oil and pass it with some butter mate.

818 2018-11-05 22:29:14 I'm not but if you look at the numbers as to where the overall strength in the economy is, look to housing and consumer spending..Cheap money is fueling it. You also have to consider that capital is fleeing our oil market
819 2018-11-05 22:29:14 YW! I love tortillas a Great recipe we used to sell in my mom's restaurant is torillas fried in peanut oil and sprinkled with  salt.....another great tortilla recipe is to spray with butter and pam,sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar, repeat spray, bake for 10 min  & let cool.

826 2018-11-05 22:28:15 The first gulf war occurred during the regime of IBB, while the 2nd Gulf war during OBJ's time. Both of them were there for 8 years each but have little to show 4 the massive influx of oil revenue.

828 2018-11-05 22:28:00 See the thing is we want lower oil prices not higher oil prices that we can live with.
829 2018-11-05 22:28:00 Honestly vitamin E oil might really be the cause of it cause I usually break out when I use it.
830 2018-11-05 22:27:48 The oil is running out. What are you jocks going to base your economy on ? Irn Bru ?
Once England no longer has to subsidise you parasites through the Barnett formula, England will prosper. The sooner Scotland leaves the UK, the better.

845 2018-11-05 22:26:33 The absurdity/cruelty of restoring sanctions on Iran aside, the oil waivers for India & China can’t be understated/are crucial to their overarching geopolitical strategies

848 2018-11-05 22:26:10 Sussed is. Dunno where the oil and joes rumour came from, coastlines fish and chip shop for the record mate. And if anyone would like to visit and give some business it’s NE24 3PL. (Great plug from me)
849 2018-11-05 22:26:02 Hi! Just wondering how you ingest the oil? Maybe that has something to do with the heart burn!
850 2018-11-05 22:25:56 Ross has more bath products than me, so whenever he works late, I’m like bath fizzies, face mask, nose strips, and hair oil 
851 2018-11-05 22:25:47 I'm rather enjoying the classical reinterpretation of Bob Dylan's "Like a Rolling Stone" at my Subaru oil change appointment.

855 2018-11-05 22:25:30 Why did all oil producing Nations worldwide experience the recession? Venezuela hasn't recovered yet. You know nothing about economy.  The 2008 recession wasn't felt since we had enough money in the nation's reserves to defend the Naira. Over $20 billion was spent that period.
856 2018-11-05 22:25:17 Girl i never knew about oil changes or brakes. I just had to take my car in and it was $1100 because i fucked some shit up in there so TAKE YOUR CAR IN!!

The political shell game keep them for so that they can get rich
859 2018-11-05 22:24:29 Oil is sold in US dollars. A litre of petrol costs $0.45 before transportation and taxes. In short petrol is cheap in Zim as compared to other countries in Sadcc

862 2018-11-05 22:24:03 Elon Musk isn’t going to do anything about oil consumption. Public transportation and urban planning will.
863 2018-11-05 22:23:46 Look for iran to freeze " gulf shipments of oil from other mid east producers like they did in 1972" ,1992, turning up the heat in the mid east, and driving up the price of oil world wide including us. " US oil profoteers!"
864 2018-11-05 22:23:39 I guess you love benzene, lead & Chromium6 in your water & unlimited levels of methane in your air. You want unregulated medical devices implanted in your body too. tRump is rolling back regulations that protect us from corporations like BP which leaked oil into Gulf of Mexico.
865 2018-11-05 22:23:30 Don't forget about all the oil that will be sold via Iraq. They are best of friends now.

Why so many oil exemptions for our Allies and China? I guess Trump could not get everyone on board. 

So much for a oil embargo.
866 2018-11-05 22:23:25 We can afford to pipe oil everywhere. How about desalination plants on the coasts with mass water pipelines going inland where it’s needed.
867 2018-11-05 22:23:22 Watching landscape artist of the year on Sky Arts. There was a lassie who literally took an emulsion brush and dabbed big blotches of oil paint at different angles over the canvas while the presenters and judges pondered over how it represented a 'seascape'.

There will be a free class about cbd oil November 7th at 6:30 PM. 

You will learn: 
-how its safe and effective
-how it's different than "weed"
-how it works
-what conditions it can help

Will be held at 4255 Westbrook drive suite 203 Aurora, Illinois 60504.
881 2018-11-05 22:21:42 Partially true but who instigated it, trained the terrorists, provided a market for their illgotten oil, armed and provided the logistics? It wasn't Syria.
882 2018-11-05 22:21:40 Eh eh. This one has passed ground but oil please. See how fine she is.

897 2018-11-05 22:19:37 I highly doubt that would be in Mueller's purview. It might come up incidentally, but I doubt anything will come of that. And there are avenues I forgot to mention that Mueller might also file indictments in, such as the Russia oil angle, as well as cabinet members.
898 2018-11-05 22:19:29 I KNOW that the guys that change my oil think I’m an absolute walnut. There’s no reason we should have that much trouble communicating about a car.
899 2018-11-05 22:19:16 You people have mind to be frying plantain.

Based on their number, they're selling over 50 Trillion bucks worth of oil in the next 20 years. Given Canada's GDP is less than 2T, how can tarsands equal all of Canada, which INCLUDES tarsands?
929 2018-11-05 22:16:15 Shows how stupid they are cos CBD oil doesn't contain any THC or if any its miniscule. U know THC, the bit that actually gets u high u idiots. CBD oil is no more a drug than the cod liver oil these fools take for their constipation lol. Grow up. #LewisShouldHaveWon

950 2018-11-05 22:13:38 Yes I might be dull but a barrel of oil as of before close of business was $60 to the nearest, for everybody, America, Uk or Zimbabwe. A litre in Zim is $1.27, in America it’s above $1.70.
951 2018-11-05 22:13:36 Oil became limiting resource in 70s and 80s. After that around 70% of wars was initiated because of it. Number is 100% if we don't count conflicts in Africa that is more like an shooting rather than war.

972 2018-11-05 22:10:57 Logistics and supply chains do limit ability to replace lost sources, true.
Same applies to oil where Saudis can increase production to replace lost elsewhere but moving it around becomes a problem.

974 2018-11-05 22:10:37 North Dakota has had trouble shipping grain out since the oil boom . It made for a shortage of train engines to pull grain cars, they were busy pulling oil cars. But I'm sure JD knew that already? Right???

997 2018-11-05 22:08:27 I'm too lazy for the complex recipes. There are some serious fat alchemists out there. If you're working out too, I had great results putting MCT oil in my shake instead of a banana.

999 2018-11-05 22:08:18 Economy: With record low oil prices in an oil dependant economy, Niger Delta avengers sabotaging oil production, he guided the nation out of a recession and doubled the reserves.

1018 2018-11-05 22:05:27 And the whole Vision initiative is beside Saudi leadership knows they can't rely on oil forever, they must diversify. We get most our oil domestically, then from Canada. We'll be fine without Saudi oil. 

Our conversion to renewable electric would likely speed up if we parted.
1019 2018-11-05 22:05:12 The problem with smoking weed is that it has spiritual consequences whereas in oil it has medicinal consequences
1020 2018-11-05 22:04:54 I've always wondered whether the term "Öl" was used in German texts because they recognized "ale" as a cognate of öl/øl of the North Germanic languages. But then, reinterpreting that as literally oil would fit German obsession with weird beer nicknames.
1021 2018-11-05 22:04:50 they could resurrect JFK and bring back the space shuttle. 
the oil companies would probably hate that and start WW3.
1022 2018-11-05 22:04:47 IRAN
Why did trump back out of Iran nuclear agreement? Why did he slap sanctions on them? I can think of 3 reasons: 1. Undo Obama's work. 2. Cut Iran oil sales benefit Saudi Arabia. 3. Weaken the Middle East country by  country on behalf of Israel. Another needless inhumane act.

1025 2018-11-05 22:04:33 Did you know there is recent data that showed, nature itself, dispersed the oil damage better than all the chemicals used.
Just read it.
It's new research.

1035 2018-11-05 22:02:55 Hey @realDonaldTrump - wanted to take this opportunity to remind you that you're nothing more than a charlatan and snake oil salesman, preying on the fears of your racist base as you systematically destroy our Democracy. Your time will come, and the world will who you really are.
1036 2018-11-05 22:02:55 Listen. I threw out a bottle last year that had expired in 2015 and found myself debating whether or not to dump it! Decided to give it the smell test and remembered just how much I hate cod liver oil
1037 2018-11-05 22:02:50 Have you tried peppermint essential oil? That stuff is MAGICAL. (Saje has BOMB roll-on I swear by)
1038 2018-11-05 22:02:48 Sauté them in garlic and butter on the stove top. Mushrooms, asparagus, broccoli all do this well. Bake some Brussel sprouts it’s olive oil and garlic and a little bit of brown sugar until they’re brown. Slice tomatoes and eat them with salt and pepper on top, cold. All so good!
1039 2018-11-05 22:02:48 All I want is an oil change THATS IT!!! all that extra shit I don’t care about!!!

1042 2018-11-05 22:02:24 To me, the main problem with the first movie is that nothing happens. Some stuff got oil on it, and flies are gross, but ...

1045 2018-11-05 22:02:15 Debt?

You would be but for the inflated sponsorship deals that manipulate the bottom lane.

The only reason you're not in debt is because of Arab oil money, not because of a well managed enterprise like City fans like to believe.

Regular oil cash injections masks the reality.
1046 2018-11-05 22:02:15 Wow essential oil diffuser + dog fart is just not pleasant
1047 2018-11-05 22:02:12 People like you hold Buhari to high standards you never had or ever demanded in your lives.
With the crippling debts, insecurity, low oil prices he inherited, you're all screaming he performs beyond your delusional standards you never used to judge your preferred administration
1048 2018-11-05 22:02:12 So are you going to sell their lands out from under them too, to Big Oil & Gas or Mining Interests or Big Timber?

1050 2018-11-05 22:01:58 Similar sanctions should apply to the Venezuelan dictatorial regime who uses the cash from oil revenues to stay in power while suppressing those who stand for democracy and regime change.

1084 2018-11-05 21:58:12 Colorado has a 30 BILLION dollar oil and gas industry. Renewable energy could never produce that kind of money for Colorado. The environment has not been harmed either. This is a reckless proposition.
1085 2018-11-05 21:58:11 there's probably also political pressure to stop a Middle Eastern advance. They already control global oil prices and own vast swathes of real estate in all major cities around the world. Western governments won't want them also controlling world football
1086 2018-11-05 21:57:52 Y’all will put small foundation, hella oil on your face, and stand in front of a window or lamp talking bout some “my skin is doing wonders” Ah you think you’re doing us? You’re doing yourself

1092 2018-11-05 21:56:50 The other option is to increase supply by allowing onshore oil and gas production (fracking). Like the USA we have the resources to create a massive glut. This, along with support for new local refining, will see prices tumble.....just like they did in the USA.

1099 2018-11-05 21:56:26 You now need to do the same without the oil. That’s the only way you can know if it actually helped.

1109 2018-11-05 21:55:29 Those figures don't even take into consideration the revenue from Oil shipped direct from the North Sea. #EnglandSubsidyJunkie #DissolveTheUnion

1112 2018-11-05 21:55:08 It’s always fun when your characters start talking to oil paintings 
1113 2018-11-05 21:55:07 Expect more hikes next year - price of oil likely to continue rising

1115 2018-11-05 21:54:45 It’s like they think they have an obligation allow themselves to be tricked by this snake oil salesman.

1117 2018-11-05 21:54:40 It means they have jumped on board the pseudo-science/snake oil gravy train and will happily accept your credit card info in exchange for a bunch of mumbo jumbo bullshit topics and products.

Caveat Emptor.
1118 2018-11-05 21:53:53 I'm getting my oil changed. If it's done and your still need a ride I'll take you.
1119 2018-11-05 21:53:53 "Blood for Oil" was an organized operation through Swiss inspection company Cotecna. Check Kojo Annan. There will be several companies piggybacking this time too.
1120 2018-11-05 21:53:51 No oil changes, and no weekly stops at the gas station.
1121 2018-11-05 21:53:22 Yeah this state sucks. I look forward to kicking Wolfe to the curb
1122 2018-11-05 21:53:17 CNN was on in the waiting room while I was getting an oil change and they were actually reporting how it could be a blue tsunami, and blabbing about Trump rhetoric, etc..I said aloud, “I can’t watch fake news” & went to another area. Unreal!  They will eat those words! #votered
1123 2018-11-05 21:53:15 Lol my original reply was supposed to be interpreted as their sheets should be changed more frequently than oil change notifications
1124 2018-11-05 21:53:14 [XINHUN] - Oil prices dip as U.S. restores sanctions against Iran
1125 2018-11-05 21:53:12 Okay then. Your revenue from oil in 2017 was not enough to pay salaries. I hope you know that? FG is broke.
1126 2018-11-05 21:53:01 Taiwan has been listed among eight countries that have received waivers from United States sanctions on imports of oil from Iran.
1127 2018-11-05 21:52:54 CBD oil?
1128 2018-11-05 21:52:43 It might turn out that the problem was simply that I needed to consume more cod liver oil
1129 2018-11-05 21:52:38 Avocado oil or stew oil ?
1130 2018-11-05 21:52:29 Almost all operators at oil and gas plants are now union just FYI. Directly because the company always want more for less making jobs more dangerous. But ya fuck the unoins

1135 2018-11-05 21:51:41 Thanks, ima gonna need it. It came in for a simple oil leak. Turns out it’s not that simple.
1136 2018-11-05 21:51:21 No it’s not! It’s the same oil but different vats. Each have their own place to be cooked.
1137 2018-11-05 21:51:20 They outlawed Lead paint but they still make it. Lead was proven harmful 10,000 years ago but people still play with it like it is good. All of that dust tends to combine with oil,water,or air and climbs up the food chain easily. #Orwell #AnimalFarm #orwell #AnimalFarm #Lobbyists
1138 2018-11-05 21:51:11 I’ve just soaked them off with baby oil because I genuinely couldn’t deal with how sparse they were  thankfully my lashes aren’t too damaged but it’s just a pure waste of money

1140 2018-11-05 21:50:37 Those ‘sun kissed’ pictures you people use to take. Is it a must to pour oil on the face before you snap?
1141 2018-11-05 21:50:25 There is a bit of me that wants this too. Mostly because it will be such a clusterfuck that it will categorically prove that the Brexiters have been selling snake oil, and they’ll be unelectable for decades.

Then I remember the hardship it will cause for the poorest. So we fight

1143 2018-11-05 21:50:20 People stopped buying the products and really important chains of supermarkets banned the companies and stopped selling their products...now they put on theirs ads that they are palm oil cree as the most important thing
1144 2018-11-05 21:50:10 Today in Iraq:
-U.S. secretary of state Pompeo doesn’t name Iraq as country to receive exemption to sanctions on Iran oil imports
-U.S. official says Iraq will receive some sort of exemption (maybe gas or food, for example) via @RudawEnglish
1145 2018-11-05 21:50:07 The dude bro is saying stuff that makes me scared. Also, there are some hashtags that reinforce my understanding of the fakest of newses. I will vote to keep the caravan away, because I’m scared, isolated, and unfamiliar with the inter webs. Give me the snake oil dude bro!
1146 2018-11-05 21:50:03 Not to sound like a Jill Stein voter but CBD oil is straight up a godsend when it comes to anxiety
1147 2018-11-05 21:50:00 Dating all the way back to the frontier times, people always bought the snake oil. There is always someone listening that will buy a share in a water purification company...

1150 2018-11-05 21:49:52 I’m hearing a lot of this ‘borders are arbitrary’ guff from the left. If that’s true then guess what? We just redrew the USA border to encompass all of Venezuela’s off-shore oil rigs. Also, China just redrew it’s border to encompass all of North America.

1179 2018-11-05 21:46:31 Every little helps though, and it's surprising how much stuff needs a pharmacist but not a prescription. And how much run of the mill stuff is prescribed, e.g. I had a prescription for olive oil for ear wax!
1180 2018-11-05 21:46:27 But, but they told us in 2014 that the oil and gas had all gone!

1188 2018-11-05 21:45:15 Some oil producing countries would be slapping their thighs now for this missed opportunity.
1189 2018-11-05 21:45:01 No shampoo or conditioner with alcohol in it, and a good beard oil.
1190 2018-11-05 21:44:58 It would be dreadful but at least one contingent of fans/media would be neutralised in the Arab oil money debate.
1191 2018-11-05 21:44:56 so these are different to the Yes bars in France?  They have Palm oil in
1192 2018-11-05 21:44:55 Does beard oil really help tame the beard?

It’s a net gain to me.

As @MacRaider stated: Kratom, B-17 and intravenous vitamin C, cbd oil, ect. are all 'NATURAL' remedies yet it has been demonized. 
Why? 
Especially Vitamin C? 
Is Vitamin C not good for the human body?

1219 2018-11-05 21:42:32 In addition to this, Palm oil for the most part is used in food and as biofuel. When sustainable oils (of any kind) are used in non foods or Bio fuels, it’s usually in tiny percentages!

How are you removing the non required ingredients after extraction. 
This is hemp oil is it not?
1253 2018-11-05 21:39:31 Some booty worship with oil. And perhaps some JOI’s?
1254 2018-11-05 21:39:25 Tea tree oil on that piercing bump will make it go away!
1255 2018-11-05 21:39:20 Oil prices will start to rise to unforeseen numbers
1256 2018-11-05 21:39:16 The most expensive resources we can ever have is not oil and gas but our brains, Japan don't have oil, coal not gas but imagine there level today. Biafra is the light of Africa
1257 2018-11-05 21:39:14 If anybody has products like oil, serums, etc that they use on straightening colored 4B hair, let me know y’all secrets 
1258 2018-11-05 21:38:58 Nigeria is on the right track. They getting Infastructures in place. Exchange rate is stable. *Huge market. Non oil FDI  especially manufacturing will flow inn despite competition if we get power solved. If cost of doing buisness is cheaper in Nigeria. Investors wiĺl come.
1259 2018-11-05 21:38:56 People die of rat lungworm in Hawaii when tiny slug babies on vegetables inadvertently eaten.  Good to saute everything in a little garlic and olive oil.

1261 2018-11-05 21:38:49 For Lavender oil you don’t have to! You can just place on a napkin and smell. It’s always safer to though but not necessary for Lavender
1262 2018-11-05 21:38:43 Is it a diet thing? Bc you can combine garlic, balsamic vinegar and oil for a low cal option.
1263 2018-11-05 21:38:30 Someone pls remind me to go get a fucking oil change this week lmao

1265 2018-11-05 21:38:18 Just spent 3 weeks in Italy; gas there was around $7.00/gallon!  I wouldn’t complain if I were you.  And US and SA have increased production to mitigate negative effect of Iran sanctions and possible spike in oil prices.

1268 2018-11-05 21:37:48 Such a bunch of hot air. Trudeau should tell truth about the disastrous way he is running this country. Our oil is not getting to market. We are running stupid deficits. Liberals would not know the truth if it was starring them in the face. Ridiculous hot air.
1269 2018-11-05 21:37:47 Wallahi very irresponsible of them, see how unkept they left him to languish in pain and sorrow, even the army we think are disciplined
1270 2018-11-05 21:37:36 CBD oil helps pain.
1271 2018-11-05 21:37:26 Somehow they rubbed it on our own generation - That dangerous idea that we are an incredibly oil rich country that can afford to subsidize everything for everyone. We are learning now
1272 2018-11-05 21:37:18 I take hope from this. My older brother is my example:  college degree, Summa Cum Laude in Law from Norte Dame and probably the sharpest person I know, but he couldn’t change the oil in his own car.  Screwed it up so bad he had to buy a new one!  A degree doesn’t equal education.
1273 2018-11-05 21:37:10 As of January 2012, #Iran exports 22% of its oil to #China, 14% to #Japan, 13% to #India, 10% to #South_Korea, 7% to #Italy, 7% to #Turkey, 6% to Spain and the remainder to France, #Greece (& other European countries), #Taiwan, Sri Lanka, South Africa.
1274 2018-11-05 21:37:04 Nothing short of great to see oil getting killed here - that's a rate cut for the economy.  No reason for oil to be (stupidly) stuck 75+

1295 2018-11-05 21:33:57 I get that we use oil and gas for nearly everything, but...

Why are we acting like these resources are never ending?

Why do we increase production when we know the environmental consequences?

...and why does gas smell so good?
1296 2018-11-05 21:33:45 I love that I'm out of work and wont get paid because the company gave me a truck that has only been serviced for oil changes in the 198k miles it's been through :/

No large cups but paid for a large drink. Chicken that has no taste other than oil. I will NEVER visit a kfc branch again.
1311 2018-11-05 21:31:48 That's exactly right....and short term solutions.  Anything largely based on oil and gas isn't going to be sustainable, then we're back where we started. Plus when the poor can't afford cigs anymore....

1315 2018-11-05 21:31:17 Spicy Italian or Italian BMT, always add bacon, provolone cheese & toasted. Lettuce, cucumber, banana pepper, mayo, extra sweet onion, light oil and vinegar. I’m pretty boring but it’s so good

1319 2018-11-05 21:31:02 I don’t think is is prudent to build a refinery with an estimated reserve of less than say 10 Billion Barrels of Oil since a refinery is min $5B in CAPEX, then there is an issue of a future with electric cars... it’s a swing mate smh

1388 2018-11-05 21:22:40 Millions of civilians were killed in Afghanistan and Iraq for Israel and oil. Armies are run by corporations. America was never under any threat from Iraq, or even a third-world nation like Afghanistan.
1389 2018-11-05 21:22:38 *oil company bribe
1390 2018-11-05 21:22:36 食パンさんおはよ〜ございます！
1391 2018-11-05 21:22:32 In my country have removed palm oil from tons of products because it seems not healthy, replaced with sunflower oil or other oils
1392 2018-11-05 21:22:31 Steak and cheese pepperjack cheese have it toasted with banana peppers, onions, salt & pepper, and Oil. Swear to mob I worked at a subway for 3 years in highschool and there is nothing better. Then whatever other toppings after it comes out of the oven
1393 2018-11-05 21:22:27 Honey, just look at your header photo. It tells us all everything we need to know about your grasp of the truth. It is hilariously removed from reality. I have no more time for your infantile banter. Run along now. Go anoint his feet with oil.
1394 2018-11-05 21:22:21 I've literally never been able to cast a VOTE 4

-Single Payer
-Banning fracking/coal
-Oil Pipelines
-Housing the homeless
-Demilitarizing/ abolish police
-Free public college

Funny those things aren't ever on a ballot

ElectionDay
1395 2018-11-05 21:22:19 Olive Oil, what an ultra maroon.
1396 2018-11-05 21:22:00 I think is even more common, and dangerous, the usual mistake of making predictions assuming an scenario of zero uncertainty regarding parameters that in fact are a moving target. We have seen that in banking and we see it now in the Peak Oil Vs Electric car debate.
1397 2018-11-05 21:21:42 Wait a sec. Isn't @CORisingAction a fake org funded by oil & gas industry, created to confuse voters with the legitimate grassroots citizen group @ColoradoRising?
I thought I was evil, but you oil & gas guys are really taking it to a new level this election! *high five for evil*
1398 2018-11-05 21:21:32 Getting my oil changed so I’ll probably leave crying bc they made me feel bad and stupid about something I know 0 about
1399 2018-11-05 21:21:22 柘榴さんおはごです！
1400 2018-11-05 21:21:20 - And it is exploration mate, can go either way... there is definitely something there but not sure if it will be economically viable looking at the quantities I got as is... at under Billion Barrels... that’s kinda fokoff in Oil Industry.
1401 2018-11-05 21:21:10 Took that black seed oil & worked out for 2 hours, cleaned up, & I didn't take my daily nap.

Maybe it's the herb, maybe it's not. We'll see.
1402 2018-11-05 21:21:09 So @realDonaldTrump after all his bluster about Iranian sanctions is encouraging 8 countries to buy oil from Iran.
What a clever deal maker! In case you weren’t aware @POTUS that was sarcasm
1403 2018-11-05 21:21:06 Aside from oil not only being used for transport fuel, two wrongs don't make a right. We shouldn't need to subsidise either.
1404 2018-11-05 21:21:00 Which skin routine again!!!

Isn't it pretty obvious she soaked herself in groundnut oil??
1405 2018-11-05 21:20:50 Not blaming his centre but that doesn't dismiss Strome. At the end of the day, the third line can't be a black hole offensively and it's on all of them to fix it.
1406 2018-11-05 21:20:47 The caption read flood 
You are saying oil spillage 
1407 2018-11-05 21:20:01 so if he has relatives in the churchyard I hate to say it but you and him could be related. Good luk with that one. 
1408 2018-11-05 21:19:56 Oil and water don't mix (بصوت مرسي)
1409 2018-11-05 21:19:42 Find the article where Jeff Nowitzky says the amount found in his system was like a drop of oil in an Olympic swimming pool. Or where the same guy, head of USADA, said there’s no way it was intentional w the amount they found and after additional tests. I speak facts, u jus hurt
1410 2018-11-05 21:19:28 Also explain why you associate oil with the murder of the journalist Khashoggi.
1411 2018-11-05 21:19:25 I sure say e lef some oil dem for go take .e be ein dem take pass the money topbf dem chop If  e no be so paaaa de3 dem de owe Berlin

1413 2018-11-05 21:19:19 Beto is one of these politicians of bygone era who promises everything like Obama and delivers nothing.  If Beto wins, he would kill off the very industry that gave #Texas a bragging right and America its energy independence - #Shale oil & gas industry. He belongs to Tom Steyer!
1414 2018-11-05 21:19:10 for sure there are still warning signs, largely due to lower world oil prices (that might never recover). but things aren't as bad conservative supporters like to pretend. let's face it... that's mostly an election ploy
1415 2018-11-05 21:19:07 Naga area naku yaje
1416 2018-11-05 21:18:57 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
1417 2018-11-05 21:18:57 @StopVaxxedLies Did you say you used CBD oil or medical marijuana? I may have the details wrong.
1418 2018-11-05 21:18:51 I have all the beans. Just figuring out a dresssing. Oil, vinegar, sugar and spices.
1419 2018-11-05 21:18:51 Gotta change that oil out cause it ain’t clean no more.
1420 2018-11-05 21:18:50 Getting ur oil changed before it hits 0% is like filling your gas tank when it’s half empty for the same price as when it’s all the way empty
1421 2018-11-05 21:18:48 Rapeseed oil comes from the rape plant, a member of the mustard family. It's used to keep our peanut butter from separating.
1422 2018-11-05 21:18:24 -Cool... just also so we are clear, this oil exploration venture is wholly funded by Invictus and its Oz Shareholders ... the GoZ is just a Connected Stakeholder.
1423 2018-11-05 21:18:09 That is way Russia and the Obama admin fuel the civil war in Syria to get closer to Golan heights.  They need that oil.   You won’t see Syrian army on the Israeli border, you see the Russian army.
1424 2018-11-05 21:18:06 Eucalyptus.

Green alcohol.
Herbal oil.

1426 2018-11-05 21:18:04 Eroton keeps mute over oil theft as illegal refining booms in Buguma, Bille, others
1427 2018-11-05 21:18:02 I’d like to. I used to do most things myself, but now I have to always pay to get jobs done. An oil change will set me back £75 at least to get it done... not to mention the time the garage would need with my car to do the job.
1428 2018-11-05 21:17:57 Also Venezuela oil industry all but collapse.
1429 2018-11-05 21:17:52 Oil
Brent crude rose by US34 cents or 0.5% to US$73.17 a barrel, but the US Nymex price fell by US4 cents to US$63.10 a barrel. 
#oil #petrol #markets #ausbiz #aufindaily
1430 2018-11-05 21:17:52 There's plenty of oil all around Scotland. We wouldn't depend on it because we have lots of natural resources.  Wind generates enough electricity to power the whole of Scotland
1431 2018-11-05 21:17:43 If corn oil is made from corn & vegetable oil is made from vegetables, what is baby oil made from? 
1432 2018-11-05 21:17:40 Getting a oil change and I’m surrounded by 4 cowboy fans. #HTTR
1433 2018-11-05 21:17:31 You get a oil change every 3,000 miles
1434 2018-11-05 21:17:30 Makes me laugh how all theses people complain about FFP again nobody gave a fu_ck about City when we were struggling & had no money! But when we play the best football this country has ever seen its just about dirty oil money!! Utd & dippers never spent money!! Go fuck urselves
1435 2018-11-05 21:17:23 Took a sick day today. So far I've:

Cleaned house
Washed and folded all laundry
Paid bills
Got oil changed in car
Washed car
Showered and painted my nails

Totally worth it.
1436 2018-11-05 21:17:19 Whole bunch of farmers in Oklahoma and Texas rich as fuck from the mineral rights on their land.  Cashing those oil and gas checks sure eases the stress I'm sure.
1437 2018-11-05 21:17:18 Chef Gusteau cut up some acne, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was some live hornets, along with sushi.
1438 2018-11-05 21:17:09 パンさんおはごでーす！
1439 2018-11-05 21:17:02 Not oil? How about the petro dollar? Saddam was about to use the euro to sell Iraqi oil instead of the U.S. dollar that Saudi Arabia uses. A similar thing happened to Gadafi when he tried to use gold over the US dollar to trade his oil...
1440 2018-11-05 21:16:54 You did say you were having the oil changed in your van today...
1441 2018-11-05 21:16:41 US Closing prices: #DOW 0.76% #NASDAQ -0.40% #Ftse100 0.14% #GBPUSD 1.304 #EURGBP 0.8749 #EURUSD 1.1409 #Gold -0.00% #Oil -0.55%
1442 2018-11-05 21:16:38 Ok I'm already with you on one thing but how do you use the oil? 
1443 2018-11-05 21:16:28 Yes the unholy Big Oil trinity: Trump’s US, Putin’s Russia, and the Medievalist Kingdom of Saudi Arabia...
1444 2018-11-05 21:16:27 I just took an anxiety pill and I’m eating chocolate chip cookies while I take a bath with peppermint oil. So, yeah.
1445 2018-11-05 21:16:13 Why the hell do we continue to put up with #TrafficViolence right in our own neighborhoods? #BigHighway and Big Oil lobby are way to powerful, for one thing. In a sense, they are also tapping in to Trump-ism by blaming the victims!
1446 2018-11-05 21:16:09 Recovery run ke go no busha madi a mmele man, kinda like how when you’re hungover you resume drinking the next morning to get rid of the hangover. I’m doing Epsom salt baths, taking magnesium and massage with Arnica oil. 

Go gobe. Nothing is cute.
1447 2018-11-05 21:15:59 #RedTideRick spent $51 billion of his own money (that he made while investing in a dirty oil pipeline Floridians didn't want in their backyard), on his campaign. Maybe he should have used that to help clean up the environmental mess he's created. Hopefully Gov. Gillum can fix it.
1448 2018-11-05 21:15:41 maybe eucalyptus essential oil?
1449 2018-11-05 21:15:38 Me: I’ve put on some wrinkle oil & eye cream
OH: you’ve given in to the patriarchy. 
Me: I know, but I have a frowny face. 
OH: but the patriarchy...
Me: I know I’ve let myself down.
1450 2018-11-05 21:15:35 I just got it but the car I had before that they lied and said I had free oil change but I ended up having to pay more for synthetic oil
1451 2018-11-05 21:15:23 ...the rider was going a bit too fast, and couldn't stop. The truck was blocking JUST enough space that if he tried to get passed he'd hit a release lever, flooding the terrain with oil and causing an ecological mess. Swerve the other way, he'd smash he beloved snake....

1463 2018-11-05 21:14:29 There’s ones that are already good to go for use on your face. If you buy an essential oil I’d dilute it with a carrier oil like coconut or avocado
1464 2018-11-05 21:14:27 ...anyway, Nate loved to sun himself on the rocky terrain alongside a mountain road near home. His owner would sometimes ride by on his bike to see his pet/reptilian friend. 

Then, one day, an oil tanker truck was parked alongside the road, across from where Nate was sunning...

1468 2018-11-05 21:14:20 Why would anybody want this moron as our state representative? He's not doing the same job as a governor, i would expect the hicks/rednecks in Florida too understand the difference in the job. Also everybody forgets how @SenBillNelson SAVED FL with that oil spill
1469 2018-11-05 21:14:17 McConnell is the snakeiest of oil salesmen.
1470 2018-11-05 21:14:14 I swear ik hella shit about cars cuz my dads a mechanic but BITCH I was running my car with 0 oil for like a week 
1471 2018-11-05 21:14:08 is it just like essential oils - so if I get the oils too and will I get a virtual def leppard back rub with lavender oil and peppermint...
1472 2018-11-05 21:14:07 さっそくMTC oil とFish oilを注文しました！
1473 2018-11-05 21:14:05 I wrote about Lucic too but the headline was about Strome. 

Bottom line, if Lucic can't score with McDavid or Draisaitl, he isn't going to score period & don't blame his centre.
1474 2018-11-05 21:14:04 So many resources. And so much exploitation by corporations like the oil companies.
1475 2018-11-05 21:14:01 You’re a couple decades late with your critic.  In case you haven’t noticed, the world is moving on from oil. Technology is surpassing you...sooner rather than later you and fossil fuels will be irrelevant.
1476 2018-11-05 21:14:00 Do you still fight with palm oil?
1477 2018-11-05 21:13:54 also i made the most amazing (vegan) mixed spice buns - freshly ground cardamom in the dough, which also came out super soft and fluffy, and left fresh nutmeg, ginger, cloves and cardamom in some coconut cream to let it soak up the flavour, then mixed it with a little coconut oil
1478 2018-11-05 21:13:51 There's nothing wrong with not reading. There's everything wrong with only reading a con man and then spending your whole life thinking you're a brain genius because you bought a bunch of snake oil that promised to raise your IQ.
1479 2018-11-05 21:13:43 This guy just keeps announcing "You have no oil!", like I'm going to do something about it. My eyes are all red and puffy. I'm shaking and can't breathe. I'm trying not to make eye contact because I look like I'm on drugs. I didn't come through the drive-thru to socialize.
1480 2018-11-05 21:13:31 around 80% of Iran's oil exports..
1481 2018-11-05 21:13:19 The guys at Quikstop that changed my oil were probably laughing the whole time at my half eaten bag of marshmallows, swimsuit, cowbell, rain boots, and Hawaiian lei. My car has always been as organized as my life.
1482 2018-11-05 21:13:15 This is also a good indication that the #Iraq government will help #Iran evade #US sanctions and IRI will step up the process of mixing Iranian #oil with Iraqi oil to get it to market. @UANI @HouseForeign
1483 2018-11-05 21:13:14 First of all, it's backpedaling. Like pedaling backwards. Peddling is selling things. And you did comment that you'd used marijuana. Shaming Michelle for using CBD oil was good enough for you, why do you think you're above shaming, stoner?
1484 2018-11-05 21:13:14 No doubt.  All the oil from fast food. lol.
1485 2018-11-05 21:13:12 Engineers and accountants is water and oil.Imtech, Dutch company, was led by engineers heavy management team. Bankrupt due to accounting scandals and lack of sufficient internal financial auditing.Had zero say in management decisions and risk management. Minimal budget for staff.
1486 2018-11-05 21:13:12 It's disgusting what they kill for their "snake oil" medicine.

1496 2018-11-05 21:11:43 Today I registered for my last semester of college courses. I also made an appointment for an oil change and neglected to take my- doctor recommended- daily dosage of Vitamin D supplements. Growing up is fun!

1498 2018-11-05 21:11:34 "you can just call me sir...!"

He'd bow, still clearly reeking of oil. Must be after all the time he's spent so far fixing up one of his cars.
1499 2018-11-05 21:11:28 Also— coconut oil! For skin. All over! Don’t dry skin after shower just pour on the oil 
1500 2018-11-05 21:11:23 It's very different as the money we spent then and still is generated by the club through astute business and good management and  through footballing achievements not through the wealth of an oil nation
1501 2018-11-05 21:11:22 Near the end of his life Van Gogh recreated this image in oil, while recuperating in the asylum at St. Rémy. Bent over with his fists clenched against a face hidden in utter frustration, the subjects appears engulfed in grief.
1502 2018-11-05 21:11:18 He even tied it to oil price. A child
1503 2018-11-05 21:11:10 Because counting calories is preferred of the top is usually wheat flour, palm oil, and leave now.
1504 2018-11-05 21:11:06 I was trying to find shampoo in soap bar form in @waitrose to no avail. Also disappointed that most of their biccies contain palm oil 
1505 2018-11-05 21:11:05 War is murder no? Man killing man? Over oil? Over land? Don’t play dumb.
1506 2018-11-05 21:10:56 The container is full of MOTOR OIL. This does not seem useful to you right now.
1507 2018-11-05 21:10:51 Hall, suffering Eastern sweats Oil and modern, with his thoughts were burned alive with his release,
1508 2018-11-05 21:10:51 Is that mold on the brick wall? Motor oil splatter?
1509 2018-11-05 21:10:43 You might wanna take out a bit of emergency insurance. And a bat.
1510 2018-11-05 21:10:37 Of course not but at some point, it would be nice for the $10M third line to chip in on occasion. You can say the dam will break but we are at the 60-game mark with Lucic and still waiting.
1511 2018-11-05 21:10:22 The hoes been flocking to my ass lately and I’m tryna figure out if it’s this new body oil scent 
1512 2018-11-05 21:10:20 I just bought the cheapest oil at Walmart tbh
1513 2018-11-05 21:10:20 エルザー　何怒ってんだよー？
1514 2018-11-05 21:10:19 Building pipelines is only going to send our oil offshore to foreign buyers enriching only a few, and won't stop Canada's reliance on Saudi oil.
1515 2018-11-05 21:10:18 Ignorance is inherently rampant at @realDonaldTrump rallies.
They come to see the Conman like in the 1800's for the snake oil.

1516 2018-11-05 21:10:17 If the tax is repealed The oil companies would only raise the price of gas to the same price since they know the public will pay that amount. So repeal only added to oil companies' profits.
1517 2018-11-05 21:10:14 What’s that movie, where that hun puts baby oil or whatever on the floor whilst mans is in the bathroom and she starts beating him with a belt and he can’t get up because it’s slippery? That scene is playing in my head but I can’t remember 
1518 2018-11-05 21:10:07 Where does the money go from this oil importer tax? And why "fuck Tim Eyman?"
1519 2018-11-05 21:10:04 Black Seed Oil, alkaline Diet, No Mucus In The Body  You Can’t Lose  Don’t Let These People LIE To You.....

1522 2018-11-05 21:09:50 @rich_goldberg I saw the list of sanction against Iran. List is an update?
1-Last year "Sanchi oil tanker" collision and Sanchi caught fire shortly after the collision but this is in list!
2- Few years ago "TAT Bank" changed its name and TAT Bank did not exist in Iran.
1523 2018-11-05 21:09:49 Trump & John Bolton's decision to largely block Iranian financial institutions from the SWIFT banking system is surely a BIG DEAL - It compounds IRAN's financial crisis, as it will make it almost impossible for Iran to get PAID for it's shipments of oil
1524 2018-11-05 21:09:48 The ratio looks reasonable though. One’s shopping would almost always have more than just cooking oil
1525 2018-11-05 21:09:45 I have a 19yo and 17yo (both boys) and it seems only yesterday Lala was just a squeaking squirming infant like her little bro. Now she’s asking for a cell phone and has started talking about driving. 
1526 2018-11-05 21:09:33 things I miss about home: the urgency to get shit done (as I sit here for 1hr+ in a mechanics “lobby” for a DAMN OIL CHANGE)  #areyouworking #ihavethingstodo
1527 2018-11-05 21:09:32 Well, isn't oil their main and only export? Seems to me these sanctions are a mirage. Just another lie.
1528 2018-11-05 21:09:26 Western governments are acting in the interests of BigOil. The White House is stuffed with US oil executives. YOU will have to organise and act, or support planned or ongoing legal actions against big polluters.
1529 2018-11-05 21:09:24 Don the Con, we don’t buy what your selling. Snake Oil is over rated. 
1530 2018-11-05 21:09:16 We've had better luck recently through ordering dishes with lots of veg and tofu and having the guy eat more of that vs all the rice. My theory it's the combo of rice and sauces with sugar and all the oil that causes the issues, so eliminating one variable helps
1531 2018-11-05 21:09:10 Also tea tree oil helped mine go down, but recently I heard it’s not the best to do anymore so I’m not sure
1532 2018-11-05 21:09:08 I need new body butter and body oil. And I know I need to get some from @jadefoxco but I’ve been procrastinating because I have a never ending wish list.
1533 2018-11-05 21:08:50 ¿ avocado oil + sea salt chips or guacamole chips ?
1534 2018-11-05 21:08:33 Come on, Colorado. No on 74. Do not finance a giant, state-destroying payout to wealthy land owners and oil companies on the backs of us regular jerks.   

(Hi, yes, I do own a home and I know this thing isn’t meant to help me and it needs to be set on fire and the ashes salted.)
1535 2018-11-05 21:08:28 no problem with oil subsidies (and associated industry tax relief) for petrol cars though? only EV's are bad.. Selective much?
1536 2018-11-05 21:08:24 I got suggestion Send them a pig ! A little Bacon and ham and a few pickled pigs feet are good  send them this gift as a peace offering and if they won’t accept it Send them a letter that was smothered in bacon grease and dried out or penned with bacon oil inkThat should be good
1537 2018-11-05 21:08:22 Totally forgot i needed to get an oil change today :(
1538 2018-11-05 21:08:09 Oil change will be the cheapest and hopefully it isn't anything too expensive on the furnace.
1539 2018-11-05 21:08:07 The Patty was season correctly it had a flame broiled taste to it crispy but not doused with oil
1540 2018-11-05 21:08:07 I learned early. Lol dont take the little one for granted.

1543 2018-11-05 21:07:26 At a glance, they likely look about as well-matched as water and oil. But what's that old saying about opposites, and the way they always seem to attract?

"I'm thinking that I just might love you."
1544 2018-11-05 21:07:15 Bring some oil with you... we should sell some of that too.

1546 2018-11-05 21:06:59 The ones that are "rounded up," and sent out of the country are back within 2 weeks and we are told border security is better than ever. That says a lot about how bad it was before and how far we have yet to go in having a SECURE BORDER.
1547 2018-11-05 21:06:40 I need a oil change
1548 2018-11-05 21:06:38 I had/have a German mother. Lol
1549 2018-11-05 21:06:29 She cheated on me with my mechanic. Put sugar and soil in both their cars engine oil Shandisi, then dated her mother. She tried killing herself when she found me half naked in her mom's bedroom. She has never been the same ever since. I ended feeling bad.

1551 2018-11-05 21:06:17 No one made more on oil than you and your family
1552 2018-11-05 21:06:15 Josie Maran argan oil body butter is sooooo good for dry skin!
1553 2018-11-05 21:06:13 i've been using coconut oil for many years. however hair growth slows as you get older and caffeine has a different physiological effect on your hair follicles than coconut oil so a mix would be good
1554 2018-11-05 21:06:11 . It’s a good name. We like it. So does she.
1555 2018-11-05 21:06:11 @BillOReilly read my tweets.  Help me find the right people to get this engine done.  You know people I don't.  This is R&D for engines.  Solves energy.  80-95% of the oil gone.  Want to help your country?  Discuss?
1556 2018-11-05 21:06:04 I have an irish mother. Nuff said.

1559 2018-11-05 21:05:33 James Milliken-Chancellor, University of Texas System “The Permian Basin represents 4% of Texas, yet would be the 4th largest oil producing country by 2025 (if we were a country)” - and the PB collectively sends $300 million in Robin Hood funds for public ed #prezVI
1560 2018-11-05 21:05:32 Would have been the same result without black seed oil. Maybe it's mildly antibacterial, but so is iodine or or hydrogen peroxide. Clean the wound and thats it. Your body will do the rest.
1561 2018-11-05 21:05:30 Being a firefighter he’d have been very worried about the presence of all that flammable liquid, and probably taken to Twitter (had it existed) to complain about the BBC promoting the deregulation of oil exploration.
1562 2018-11-05 21:05:27 I’m not ready for this oil change cause I know the mechanics are gonna give me shit about my alternator cause they told me I need to change it last time I was here lol
1563 2018-11-05 21:05:26 I got a question as Donald Trump is so sure that there's a trade deficit with China why are we giving him an exception to buy Iranian oil??

1565 2018-11-05 21:05:10 But you wouldn’t be the tough self-sufficient person you are today without those experiences? . It’s not what happens to you; it’s how you handle it.
1566 2018-11-05 21:05:06 Not at all. You both shame people for using CBD oil, admit that you have gotten high in the past, AND promote cannabis as an alternative treatment. Which is it?
1567 2018-11-05 21:05:03 #IRAQ ENDED TRUCKED CRUDE SHIPMENTS TO IRAN A MONTH AGO; INCREASED EXPORTS FROM QAYARA OILFIELD TO PERSIAN GULF - OIL MINISTRY OFFICIALS: PLATTS. #OOTT

1569 2018-11-05 21:04:59 Dude, you've gotten confused by crony capitalism. Every regulation that has been removed has been to the benefit of his allies like the hucksters at AmWay, Big Oil, and Wall Street, clearing the way for another massive theft from the American people. Enjoy your 2% tax reduction.
1570 2018-11-05 21:04:58 How much is your break oil in your filling stations?
1571 2018-11-05 21:04:46 Girl idk if you want to hear this but.. change your fucking oil
1572 2018-11-05 21:04:42 Love the name! For pancakes though you simply need to scrape off the butter/oil you’re using. I use butter, scrape it around & then take a paper towel & gently wipe off my griddle. Pancake refactoring!

1579 2018-11-05 21:04:03 the thought of taking makeup off with a wipe instead of cleanser/oil/miscellar makes me cringe
1580 2018-11-05 21:04:03 By the way, Norway is highly dependent upon oil.  They have not used their wealth to expand into other areas and the citizens are poorly trained to do more technical work.  Do you really think that’s a good economic model?  I don’t
1581 2018-11-05 21:03:55 UKOG will never buyout or merge with Angus. They aren’t that silly!
1582 2018-11-05 21:03:48 Price for Crude oil appreciates yet Fuel Price in APC govt is CONSTANT. Only TIME will reveal the TRUTH but i hate it is when a matured married man with children come to the media and lie. Days are counting we have been fooled for so long.

1588 2018-11-05 21:02:58 Natural Aloe Vera is good for your scalp. Do not use hair styling gels. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Is it NISIM or NHB? supposed to stop hair loss. or comparable. What must I do to uncover the official web site. So healthy. Must get it.
1589 2018-11-05 21:02:53 There's a whole lot of oil prices baked into that graph. Really should be adjusted to core inflation if we want to iron out the noise. (although I understand if it's *only* about discretionary income and not policy/labor economics..... oil prices are relevant)

1594 2018-11-05 21:02:32 Remember when she shamed Michelle for using CBD oil to treat a condition, and then admitted she liked weed, too?
1595 2018-11-05 21:02:20 For MSNBC, running that ad is akin to pouring oil on the RESIST fire regardless of the heat they'll take for showing it.
1596 2018-11-05 21:02:17 Yes of course, but as we've seen with several players lately, the dam will break eventually. In the meantime he's sawing off during 97 & 29's rest time.

1602 2018-11-05 21:01:52 #Norway has the highest number of electric cars per capita. in the world, and is very eco-friendly, but its oil industry has paid off the National debt (debt ZERO) and has established a fund for future generations.

1603 2018-11-05 21:01:41 Yes, but crude oil just needs to be refined

1606 2018-11-05 21:01:30 Is your regular lotion just not cutting it anymore?  If you're looking for a more moisturizing formula, try adding a few drops of vitamin E oil - it'll increase that moisturizing power and add in some antioxidants, too! #skincaretips

1608 2018-11-05 21:01:22 Acrylic is all we ever used in highschool, there was a trick to making it dry slower, though I don't recall what it was.

1609 2018-11-05 21:01:21 Nothing to see here folks.

1620 2018-11-05 21:00:15 Wind & solar without subsidies are now cheaper than coal with subsidies. Fyi coal, oil & gas receive over $10 billion in subsidies per year. Think.

1622 2018-11-05 21:00:10 He also conveniently forgets Vyvyan got pregnant in the Young Ones, 34 years ago. Probably preferred it when they struck oil in the basement, and stuff.

1630 2018-11-05 20:59:36 85% of America's global economy is powered by oil & gas & coal. Our #RFID tags are made to withstand the conditions of these fields.
1631 2018-11-05 20:59:31 If not possible subjugate enemy in easy way, or occupation failed, then withdraw after destroy everything, kill everyone you can, burn thier crops, oil fields, industrial capability - sounds familiar strategy !?

1633 2018-11-05 20:59:25 Whoever you may be, the Trumpster is pathological serial liar. He is a snake oil salesman; no more, no less.
1634 2018-11-05 20:59:21 Our oil is just an additional greatness to our nation. Our population in youth percentage is a greater asset only if .......

1637 2018-11-05 20:59:18 The only two asset classes not seeing upward movement in the price:  PMs and oil.  If they go up, the jig is up.  Can't have that.  By any means necessary. . .

1639 2018-11-05 20:58:55 Yup, but everyone has there reasons. Huge reasons is my family is in oil and gas. And a lot of jobs rely on oil and gas and Beto is putting higher regulations on oil and gas.
1640 2018-11-05 20:58:54 nah $65 for an oil change is too much lol I rather not
1641 2018-11-05 20:58:53 @dannywood Getting the oil changed :)
1642 2018-11-05 20:58:50 I think Alaska might be a bit slow on this product.. I previously used Simple's cleansing oil but it disappeared from shelves, along with every other cleansing oil in existence. Why is Alaska so afraid of cleansing oil :(
1643 2018-11-05 20:58:34 Nigeria has bastard money. Even with the low oil price and high expense on Crude prod, Nigeria still rakes in bastard money. Let’s not even talk about those rich Nigerians that are lowkey
1644 2018-11-05 20:58:33 It's a surprise Fash who said providing power is no 'rocket science' is asking us where to get money from..oil is selling now at over $70 a barrel, so much looted money now is now in your kitty & with your expertise at borrowing, pls borrow yourself sense!

1647 2018-11-05 20:58:16 Me (as child): 
I can't wait until I'm older and spend my days off doing anything I want, when I want. 

Me (as adult):   
Glad I made it to the service center before they closed, now I'll stare at a wall for awhile as I wait for my oil change. #yolo
1648 2018-11-05 20:58:07 I didnt name Iraq bc i havent looked into it, but overall the same applies: extract oil via contractors, have the military complex cash in tax payer money, banks strengthen influence on government by increased debt, keep another middle east country at a low power level.
1649 2018-11-05 20:58:05 my friends in iran...TRUMP started the BIG PRESSURE today

your oil.  it will be hard for a while.  important.
1650 2018-11-05 20:58:00 Odjove is Marula Oil and can be used as a sauce in your soup and can also be used as cooking oil but Omaadi Eengobe can be used as Cooking oil substitute.
1651 2018-11-05 20:57:54 LOW OIL PRESSURE!!!!
1652 2018-11-05 20:57:51 I'm amazed at how much money the oil and gas industry has thrown against 112. And every time I see a sign or a banner I think "They're running scared. Im voting yes". And I did. I dropped the ballot in the box in front of the Denver museum of nature and science
1653 2018-11-05 20:57:37 i’ve been waiting for this damn oil change for like 45 minutes i’m over this
1654 2018-11-05 20:57:35 Some say he drinks oil and pees diesel
1655 2018-11-05 20:57:31 If you think that's good, try coconut oil. Seriously.

1657 2018-11-05 20:57:17 Fantastic Scott, thank u for sharing - I want to know how it ends! 'The year is 2040. Following the global collapse catalysed by the oil wars, the dairy industry in New Zealand has crumbled. Fertile river terraces once again bristle w Tainui kūmara; the river flows ever on.'

1659 2018-11-05 20:56:59 Bought cottage. Oil boiler. Didn't check level for 1 week. Run out. Cold now.
1660 2018-11-05 20:56:51 Profiling is wrong.
 White men are dangerous and need profiling. 
Yes, mental illness is a huge problem.
1661 2018-11-05 20:56:48 Iraq, Libya, Venezuela, and now Iran. Oil is the common denominator and the sanctions imposed by the USA, ENGLAND, SAUDI ARABIA, and others to destroy these countries, directly contribute to world instability.
1662 2018-11-05 20:56:41 Get this women some snake oil to sell!
1663 2018-11-05 20:56:37 You are just a Troll. So it makes no sense to send you link to italian and german documentations showing that snipers hired by US shot people of both sides at the maidan to make it escalate. US expands NATO and blockades russian pipelines in ukraine to sell own oil/gas to europe
1664 2018-11-05 20:56:26 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, thanks for doing a great job!  We need to get off of our foreign oil dependency.  Buying oil from these terrorist sponsors IS sponsoring terrorism.  I hope some day we are able to make this happen.

1667 2018-11-05 20:56:20  Oh I hear you!! Those horrid pre-mixed cocktails! I lived on bread, olives, mozzarella, tomato and olive oil! Greek souvlaki galore after work! 
1668 2018-11-05 20:56:14 Italian oil major Eni will look at the Iran sanctions measures to see if it can use Iranian crudes to allow it greater flexibility in procuring supplies, a spokesman said on Monday.
1669 2018-11-05 20:56:09 Conversely, you can only burn petrol and diesel once, so you need to keep shipping crude oil from overseas.
1670 2018-11-05 20:56:07 Wow, is that oil?
1671 2018-11-05 20:56:01 next leg up for $energy $gush $gasl, we need $oil to bottom out
 tomorrow's trading should give us a better insight.....wait and see
1672 2018-11-05 20:55:54 They are doing what u fools fail to do. You sit on huge deposits of oil and don’t even know and do anything about it then complain when someone sees an opportunity
1673 2018-11-05 20:55:49 Tried everything was mine u name it drugs , plug ins thunder shirt loud music it's a bloody shame. Still to try cannabis oil hope it's delivered tomorrow.
1674 2018-11-05 20:55:40 It's good with crackers. You're still gluten free, ya? @GoneCrackers with cottage cheese (I prefer it with chives or green onion mixed in) is actually quite good. Add black pepper and/or good olive oil too if you're extra.
1675 2018-11-05 20:55:37 Unconventional drilling technology in SE NM is translating into huge producing oil and gas wells on State Trust Lands and BLM lands in NM.this benefits our Public School system and Educ in NM as well as other institutions.. hope we maintain if you are the next Land Commissioner
1676 2018-11-05 20:55:25 I am convinced there are Oil fans that will be bitching about specific players performance even when we win the cup again. It’s a team game peeps! We have a good record. Enjoy it #insufferables
1677 2018-11-05 20:55:24 You sure ?! Even our oil?!!Think again !
1678 2018-11-05 20:55:24 @BetoORourke has accomplished a few things lately...
He has greatly leaned on the oil & gas sector to travel all over Texas...
He has promoted diabetes awareness for his choice of eating...
He has boosted the dry cleaning industry from all the pit stains...
#ChooseCruz @tedcruz

1681 2018-11-05 20:55:10 Oil and gas engineering, MSC.
1682 2018-11-05 20:55:05 People with oily skin, you have to moisturize too! When you don’t, your skin just produces more oil to combat the dryness. Essentially you’re making your skin even oilier when you don’t moisturize.
1683 2018-11-05 20:55:01 Big oil agenda...that’s all it is.. GOP Is the most corrupt criminal organization ever

1687 2018-11-05 20:54:43 Boiling milk? Boiling oil? My fist? My other fist? My foot? A knife? A heavy blunt object? I could spill a lot of things on a Nazi.

1690 2018-11-05 20:54:28 Only till the oil runs out
1691 2018-11-05 20:54:21 Make oil irrelevant ? Thats a waste or not optimally using it, thats incompetence. Must oil be irrelevant to develop human capital? Is it not the oil money you will use to do that ? Just few months of low oil output in Nigeria almost grounded the country. Egbami fa
1692 2018-11-05 20:54:20 And his MAGA followers will buy this snake oil.
1693 2018-11-05 20:54:20 What a shocker the fake oil club are corrupt
1694 2018-11-05 20:54:18 which essential oil is going to convince this woman to fall in love with me?
1695 2018-11-05 20:54:15 He must be under "bigly" pressure from his weathy oil cronies.
1696 2018-11-05 20:54:14 How long did it take for the oil to show results?
1697 2018-11-05 20:54:10 Italian oil major Eni will look at the Iran sanctions measures to see if it can use Iranian crudes to allow it greater flexibility in procuring supplies, a spokesman said on Monday.
1698 2018-11-05 20:54:03 Unwrap your turban baby and let down your hair. Pour oil all in my hands and stroke on your beard.
1699 2018-11-05 20:53:58 Gavecal  ... if and when the following happens: Saudi Arabia adopts the renminbi for oil payments Germany changes its stripes and cozies up to Russia and pretty much gives up on the whole Eu integration charade in order to  self-interest.
1700 2018-11-05 20:53:54 Oh ... and get the oil in your f’n car changed already!!!!

1703 2018-11-05 20:53:35 Yes, it's like a mini face lift. I use it as a mask. Also, tumeric, coconut oil & honey mask is THE TRUTH
1704 2018-11-05 20:53:30 Not nice to point out that illegal border hoppers comitting crimes after numerous reentry and lack of law enforcement when they ate identified,  come from south of our border. 
To salve hurt feelings we are supposed to turn a blind eye.
1705 2018-11-05 20:53:26 Its war & fearmongering week again.

There will be not war against #Iran and the Zionists will not be able to halt Oil exports.

The end.
1706 2018-11-05 20:53:20 Italian oil major Eni will look at the Iran sanctions measures to see if it can use Iranian crudes to allow it greater flexibility in procuring supplies, a spokesman said on Monday.

1708 2018-11-05 20:53:13 So Hannah stepdad put a gallon of water in my car, change my oil, and rinsed my engine and battery off. Offer a six pack of beer. 
I made it out cheaper buying all of the oil stuff and beer, then I would have at Walmart.
1709 2018-11-05 20:53:07 Right!!! With “RAVE” in like a psychedelic oil spill texture.
1710 2018-11-05 20:53:02 O'boy not in my house... Hot oil poured on me and they offered me 0.01% of the plantain as consolation 
1711 2018-11-05 20:52:55 Engine oil, steely abs, face kick, snuggle wumpkins.
1712 2018-11-05 20:52:50 can't believe China helping against oil from Iran. I still don't believe it maby they just not got there fake island done yet.only trump has the plan in front of him hope army in iran  chases the mullah out of office just like ejypt.did to Hillary's Muslim brotherhood she pushed

1714 2018-11-05 20:52:37 Our mystery product is..Awaken the Senses Body Oil, a sumptuous oil to increase hydration levels, especially important as the weather will be getting colder soon!!
1715 2018-11-05 20:52:32 Remember, no matter whether Dem or Rep, you will still be able to support terrorists worldwide and bomb the shit out of other countries ( if they have oil) ..
1716 2018-11-05 20:52:29 l doubt that. If US has so much oil maybe they can lower prices for the hard working average American.  You may be able not to kiss the Saudi's backside anymore and we all will have cheap gas.
1717 2018-11-05 20:52:20 yasss this wild hair growth oil is making my scalp feel SOOOOO nice rn wtf
1718 2018-11-05 20:52:15 I legit cannot find cleansing oil from any brand outside of Ulta or Sephora (not even sure if cleansing oils are stocked there in AK anymore lmao) until today when I saw Burt's Bees cleansing oil?? Going to try it out 
1719 2018-11-05 20:52:10 Cristóbal López deberá ir a Tribunales a dar explicaciones por Oil Combustibles. Si no puede ir, me avisan que se las doy yo: No pagó un puto impuesto durante 7 años y ni bien se las tomó Echegaray, la AFIP le pidió la quiebra.
1720 2018-11-05 20:52:07 I follow a natural ayurvedic regimen where I wash my face with all natural carrier oils & use stuff like tumeric, coconut oil, honey & eggs for face masks. Honestly, I've used all the expensive stuff in the past & this regimen has been the best.....for me.
1721 2018-11-05 20:52:03 He certainly does but zero points. this far into the season, just isn't acceptable.
1722 2018-11-05 20:52:01 listen to President Trump and learn. He'll do it gradually not to cause a global sharp rise on oil prices, which will also affect home heating by natural gas and coal, just at the start of Winter.
1723 2018-11-05 20:51:56 So that firstly the govt can take a big wack as tax (excise) then the oil companies take a wack for their profits, after that, the retailers take their wack ... and donut goes!
1724 2018-11-05 20:51:56 But what about the oil laaaa, empty seats, sheiks and errrrr shit like that
1725 2018-11-05 20:51:45 The Country has enjoyed Alberta's free hand outs. Now when the tables are turned and we need their support. WHERE are they. OIL is the blood of this nation. Blodsucking BC needs to get their buts on  board. Who built their roads paid for their infrastructure. YA.
1726 2018-11-05 20:51:26 Never been in an Elise but I'll take your word for that. With older cars there's a distinct aroma of leather, oil and who-knows-what which I love, as you said, it's a very nostalgic thing. The scent can take you back, and stir up long-ago memories.
1727 2018-11-05 20:51:21 B-but oil I wuv u sm. Y u no play wit meh

1731 2018-11-05 20:51:06 Trump is anti science.
Why would he help the planet ?
He's also in the pockets.of big oil companies
1732 2018-11-05 20:51:05 If the areospace or auto sectors were pulling up stakes and moving to the USA or Mexico the liberals would treat this as a code red situation, because the oil and gas sector is western CDN based they don’t consider it a priority.
1733 2018-11-05 20:51:02 Are wood handled knives not all finished? My Shuns definitely have a finish and would never absorb any oil.
1734 2018-11-05 20:50:59 Hydro bill in the winter in Nain hovers around $200.00 a month my place, That's just light and 1 space heater in the porch so my washer don't freeze. I burn stove oil for heat at $317.00 for 45 gallons/2 weeks. How much your down your way? #nlpoli #cdnpoli
1735 2018-11-05 20:50:55 I have to go get my oil changed n windshield wipers replaced alone 
I hate adulting
1736 2018-11-05 20:50:42 and in later life as an apprentice someone was always putting a light ciggy end in your rule pocket of your boiler suit .....ah the smell of burning oil/denim/cotten .....
1737 2018-11-05 20:50:18 Instead of trying to stop people from coming here, why not hold their country's leaders accountable & help make their countries safe? We stick our noses in other people's business over control of oil, why not for safety of People? At least that would be an honorable endeavor.
1738 2018-11-05 20:50:11 I think im bouta drink some castor oil and see if that puts me in labor 
1739 2018-11-05 20:50:07 Snake oil salesman follows carnival . Carnival follows the mad mob
1740 2018-11-05 20:50:05 Also, which one is the fish oil? Why do we have 4 different oils in this house? 
1741 2018-11-05 20:50:03 What about the justice for millions of Iraqies your army killed?! Or they don’t deserve justice because your goverment stole their oil ?!
1742 2018-11-05 20:50:03 Do Si Dos got it on da Flower n oil 
1743 2018-11-05 20:50:01 Nigerian oil and gas sector records 8% rise in gas production. Meaning what? Pump price reduction? Living wage for all? Constant power supply? Portable roads? Quality basic universal education? Health and social care for all? Hmmm  
1744 2018-11-05 20:49:56 I’m afraid palm oil is in quite everything, it’s so frustrating 
1745 2018-11-05 20:49:55 It is just an unfortunate fact I guess that 99% of illegal border hoppers come from this hemisphere south of our border. 
It's not racist, just an uncomfortable fact for some.
1746 2018-11-05 20:49:52 Global oil demand is growing*

*Mostly from China. Which is going full force into renewables. And making up the difference with deals to exploit African oil.
1747 2018-11-05 20:49:41 كلامك صحيح وافضل من السوداني بكثيييير .. خاصة اننا مانستخدم مبيدات أو اسمده وعصره اولى ع البارد 
1748 2018-11-05 20:49:41 I mix a bit of the pure vitamin e oil w my moisturizer helps! it can be sticky at first, once you mix it, it just thickens the moisturizer (plus I have dermatitis and I find it doesn't provoke more flareups, so good if you have sensitive skin)
1749 2018-11-05 20:49:40 love getting oil changes because they throw out all my trash
1750 2018-11-05 20:49:38 Which one is the oil?

1755 2018-11-05 20:48:49 Gas station or engine oil?
1756 2018-11-05 20:48:47 It's because we had a Conservative Majority Government of Stephen Harper looking after Canada.  He actually realized Canada's oil fields and the power they yielded. Trudeau and his Leftist Climate Change policies have badly hurt the Alberta Oil Patch.  He won't build pipelines.
1757 2018-11-05 20:48:40 I have stage 2b stomach cancer and have been taking cbd oil as it helps me relax at night after radiotherapy  some people stoop to any level to hurt others   sometimes social media just isn't worth it

1773 2018-11-05 20:47:17 Have you been THINKING about ordering the C.B.D. Oil from me, but hasn’t yet? What’s stopping you? 

Be honest, I got to know!
1774 2018-11-05 20:47:14 Oh how I love car repair shops. “Hey I’m here for an oil change” “no problem!! Sir your brakes need to be changed, your air filter is dirty, your transmission fluid is too dark, it’ll just be $2,000. But I’ll give you $15 off”
1775 2018-11-05 20:47:11 Calling $WSJ what its is: a Fake News site, always spreading FUD about Tesla! CGrant is it true that you have ties to Tesla short Chanos? Do you get paid by the oil cartels? #tesla #pravduh $tsla $tesla
1776 2018-11-05 20:47:10 Without seeing your bill, we assume you're referring to a drain plug gasket, which depending on your vehicle may need to be changed with every oil change (metal gaskets) or based on wear and tear (rubber gaskets). The charge for this is a standard $1.99 + HST. Hope this helps!
1777 2018-11-05 20:47:08 Yo is vewy welcome :-)

We jus sliced sum sweetpotatoes n' normal potatoes thinly, brushed 'em wiv oliv oil and salt n' pepper on bof sides. I suggest yo only do one side. Put in oven 150-175 degrees celcius for 15-20 min or so. Until they look done :)
1778 2018-11-05 20:47:06 Trump knows exactly what he is doing, he is a con man. He is playing these people for suckers. Difference is, Trump knows these people are being taken for a ride. Sad part is, these folks don't know it. Snake oil salesman rolls on.

1781 2018-11-05 20:46:37 Truth is insensitive sometimes. 
If he was European illegal alien with exact same history? Couldn't play race card then.
1782 2018-11-05 20:46:29 Random! World-wide oil use/day= 99,500,000 barrels, 42 gallons in a barrel. Total use 4,179,000,000 gallons oil/day (1,525,335,000,000 gallons/year). Lake Ontario holds 432,739,038,939,439.8 gallons of H2O. In 283.70 years our current oil consumption fills the lake @sethpalmer3

1785 2018-11-05 20:46:10 @POTUS According to YOU, Putin and others, the worlds priorities are oil, and arms. Which keeps pollution and countries fighting in place. YOU'RE Warped reality won't mean anything when this planet is UNINHABITABLE. And CIVILIZATION  (Yes and all of YOU ) is EXTINCT. DUH
1786 2018-11-05 20:46:08 Mr president it is november 4 and Iran is exporting about 2 million barrels oil a day. You said it would be 0 on November 3. Mr president I just can say that : " " 
1787 2018-11-05 20:46:05 After sleeping in today I have a sudden urge to learn oil paints
1788 2018-11-05 20:45:59 I'm in an office and on the Prairies. Basically, lotion my body immediately after each bath, frequently oil and lotion hands, moisturize face in addition to SPF. And, yeah, drink water and tea. But mostly just reapply lotion all the freakin' time.
1789 2018-11-05 20:45:58 True, till end of March 2019 to not disturb oil market prices
1790 2018-11-05 20:45:55 Very strange, model breaking day. VIX up. Dollar down. Oil down. Spx up. Waiting for 3:50 to buy everything. Just kidding.

1792 2018-11-05 20:45:49 Don't see a problem other than SA wants more gun control. Oh, and trigger discipline. Not my choice of firearms, but all good if it's an open carry state.
1793 2018-11-05 20:45:35 I have chronic daily headaches and use a topical 20mg CBD oil on my temples. Usually that’s enough to help without resorting to painkillers.
1794 2018-11-05 20:45:27 Last week Germany announced they would buy US natural gas. Now China wants to buy US oil.

1799 2018-11-05 20:45:09 We are a major oil & gas producer, one of the world’s largest, in total and per capita. Shall we produce less what the world demands? Impoverish Canada for elusive unproven “climate” goals ?

1801 2018-11-05 20:45:04 No thanks. Vaseline or coconut oil will do just fine.

1820 2018-11-05 20:43:29 Reading an article about "service sex" and getting upset because there isn't an oil change or transmission tune-up. Not even coupons for those at the end of it.

1833 2018-11-05 20:42:13 That is an awesome story! We're so happy you've had such a positive experience with CBD oil.
1834 2018-11-05 20:42:11 Lets see what KSA says after the midterms. There mission of keeping oil down is done. Me thinks a little jawboning might be on the table very soon.  LOL
1835 2018-11-05 20:42:10 Same! I’m testing a few serums as we speak but grape seed oil has been saving me.
1836 2018-11-05 20:42:09 God is not in a building, where you can only visit Him on Sunday morning. You can talk to Him while you vacuum, or  while you change the oil in your car. When you let God become involved in every aspect of your life, every day becomes exciting.

1839 2018-11-05 20:42:06 So why is North Korea ramping up the Nuclear bombs, Iran is threatening to stop oil, the farmers are going broke, the price of groceries are up again and oil is going to go thru the roof...but hey, you get to support yourself a rich man!
1840 2018-11-05 20:41:55 CBD oil has sorted me right out
1841 2018-11-05 20:41:51 We've tried all other paths for the past 40 years, the iranian society has long been collapsed, it's the regime and its oil fortune that needs to collapse in order to permit the iranian nation to rise and take back its destiny
1842 2018-11-05 20:41:40 My director as u knw Nigeria bribes senior international and local press with large sums of monies also bribe some key men and woman with Biafran crude oil. But for how long until the truth will be out. Biafrans HV risen Neva to fall again.
1843 2018-11-05 20:41:38 and that 's the splendid mess that global arms trading/politics is.... we end up being bombed by people we've sold arms to when they stop selling us oil cheap.....
1844 2018-11-05 20:41:38 The economy in Colorado gonna tank hard if y'all vote that shit in. Weed is great and all but y'all make booku bucks off oil and natural gas too.

1850 2018-11-05 20:40:47 Just curious, how many people have died on Metro in the last year?  

How many people in auto crashes?  From diseases related to air quality?  From diseases related to sedentary lifestyles?  From wars waged for oil?

Which one is the death trap?
1851 2018-11-05 20:40:44 CBD oil is very expensive in South Africa and not freely available to pets, but i know some people who uses it with great success in furkids (dogs)... Praying that this will help him through these hard difficult days...
1852 2018-11-05 20:40:37 Andrew, check out Oil of Oregano, it is some powerful stuff. It is a natural virus killer. A few years ago I had the flu and bad. My temp was 102.something. I put a few drops of the oil in a half glass of milk. Several minutes later, I repeated it. Within a half hour, my fever
1853 2018-11-05 20:40:11 Just a look back from You sets me off. Should I grab the oil and massage Your back or turn around and assume the position, and on & on. That's all it take ... just a look from You, Delilah! I'm powerless.
1854 2018-11-05 20:40:09 ..and mops up US debt as Euro system insulated itself & no more supports US inflation exports. Oil price is kept high. All 3 win-win-win. China gains industrialization, oils high price and new Big customer, US found somebody else than those pesky Europeans to its USD sys support.

1858 2018-11-05 20:40:03 My spirit needs an oil change.
1859 2018-11-05 20:40:02 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
1860 2018-11-05 20:39:50 Oh and your an oil painting 
1861 2018-11-05 20:39:46 I carry around lavender oil and an agate in hospitals. There is power in scentifying our energies; or so I make believe.
1862 2018-11-05 20:39:32 US renews Iran sanctions to choke Iran's oil and shipping industry. Gives temporary waivers to top customers like India and China, in order to avoid a 'shock' in oil prices. United States to go into polls today for the most expensive mid-terms in US history.
1863 2018-11-05 20:39:20 It took a lot of research to decide on the amendments and I still can’t figure out what vaping has to do with off shore drilling... hmmm maybe big oil and tobacco 
1864 2018-11-05 20:39:15 Will affect? WTF...It's already affected my finances with exchange rate dropping my holiday spends... trivial example? Maybe. What's oil traded in.. Oh yes.. dollars. So my fuel is ALREADY AFFECTED.  ,Will.... FFS it's already here and doing damage econo.ically
1865 2018-11-05 20:39:14 Iran just starts with Israel but ends up with the whole oil region being at a huge war. Why do you think Russia is there? Not only to establish a foothold, it just got it. Their aim is to bring war there. More war there — higher oil prices.
1866 2018-11-05 20:39:13 literally idk bc I wasn’t flirty or friendly or anything, I just told him I needed an oil change and he did it, then when I went to pay he told me my total was $5.10, I didn’t question anything  want me to take yours? lmaooo
1867 2018-11-05 20:39:05 Nope, not true. I get oil changes, faithfully.

1870 2018-11-05 20:38:57 GF flour mix, 1 cup, 2 Tbsp cold water and 1/8 C egg sub. Veg oil substitute for butter.   Thanks. It is similar to mine but I don’t always use the egg.
1871 2018-11-05 20:38:57 Global oil prices were mixed overnight. The US formally applied
fresh trade sanctions on Iran. But eight countries were granted
temporary waivers, allowing them to buy oil from the country. Oil -0.1% #markets
1872 2018-11-05 20:38:50 Biomass is just a nonsense fuel that pretends to have a zero carbon footprint. We're just burning trees shipped in polluting ships from Scandanavia - nothing eco friendly about that. Biomass would be coal/oil if left a few million years.
1873 2018-11-05 20:38:26 DOWN WITH ALL THE RELATIVES
1874 2018-11-05 20:38:19 More oil means more pollution means crappier existence for all of our kids and their kids. Polluted air, polluted water, polluted ground, pollutes you!
1875 2018-11-05 20:38:16 Funny how a nation (USA) spends massive amounts of money to protect foreign oil supplies and even has their currency based in oil, yet nobody can figure out how to solve this problem.  I have the solution.  Want to help serve your country?  Want to avoid a nuclear war?  Discuss?
1876 2018-11-05 20:38:16 Just had to schedule an oil change for Next Saturday 
1877 2018-11-05 20:38:08 "This ur oil can fry egg o"

1884 2018-11-05 20:37:15 You know you’re an adult when you’re happy you can change the oil of our car on your day off of school.
1885 2018-11-05 20:37:09 If you're interested in trying CBD oil we'd love to answer any questions you have 
1886 2018-11-05 20:37:04 The US wants to be the only hand on the oil spigot.
1887 2018-11-05 20:37:02 i have had good results with charlotte's web brand cbd oil. i take the oil orally when i'm anxious and having trouble focusing. after a uterine fibroid embolization, i was so desperate for pain relief, i rubbed the oil all over my abdomen and i felt like it actually helped a lot.
1888 2018-11-05 20:36:56 Election day is tomorrow,  so don't forget: Some states/cities don't allow alcohol sales during polling hours. 

In other words, Last call, people! Don't get caught without lamp oil when the bridal party arrives.
1889 2018-11-05 20:36:54 I looked it up and it gave me a super involved answer. I put oil olive, salt/pepper, chili flakes and basil and roast for 30 minutes. I try to use red potatoes because they're delicious.
1890 2018-11-05 20:36:50 Came for a oil change. And they want me to trade my truck in 
1891 2018-11-05 20:36:29 Someone teach me how to change the oil in my car, I’m tired of getting finessed
1892 2018-11-05 20:36:11 wow, look into a natural product, cbd - you may find tremendous relief from a full-spectrum tincture oil.
1893 2018-11-05 20:36:02 @realDonaldTrump Well, listen to the words of Tramp, he justifies his weakness,did not want the price of oil rise,why do not you say we do not want the Iranian regime to collapse soon. I advise free people never to trust Trump, he has surrendered to the Jews. The liar of betrayal
1894 2018-11-05 20:35:35 Since #oil has been discovered in #Tchad & #Cameroon and a #Pipeline built that area has never been safe again. @CNN @BBC @WSJ @Reuters languages is not the problem in Cameroon since ours were eradicated years ago. #Cameroonians care about #French& #English as u do ours

1897 2018-11-05 20:35:10 We keep winning! I thought the Chinese were waiting for Trump losing badly in the midterms and decide not to negotiate.  Guess they gave up beforehand. Make a great deal Mr. President!!  You already got the Saudis to lower oil prices in return for saving their rear ends!
1898 2018-11-05 20:35:00 You can’t support big oil and renewables. Pick one.
1899 2018-11-05 20:34:46 @business @CarolineHydetv @scarletfu @markets #USClose: #Trump is correct he don't want to push the price of oil up & it has nothing to do with #Iran and everything to do with The #USMidTermElection.

Store goals: clean up from Xmas set up (back stock and put out what isn’t exposed), bank run, follow up with applicants for CDM/IRV, submit store photos for CDM (VM), organize back room 
Personal: schedule oil change for my car
1906 2018-11-05 20:33:50 And I know you’re a classic case of the ignorant clown who projects his own affliction of confirmation bias and rationalisation onto those who know better.

Yeah cannabis oil cures cancer and big pharma hide it because they can’t patent a plant.......

1909 2018-11-05 20:33:27 Mr Trump seems model himself on some sort snake oil salesman and if hate gets him a vote that is what counts. The GOP don't know anything else that works as well for them. The problem is the damage done to the USA's standing in this global world. Political followers not leaders
1910 2018-11-05 20:33:27 i also make my own body butter full of jojoba oil and shea, it’s 10 times better than that Palmers and Jergans stuff you find at walmart :)
1911 2018-11-05 20:33:26 New tires and a oil change, Lilly living more than I.
1912 2018-11-05 20:33:10 LOL.  This was a known scam back in the 1970s. Been repeatedly debunked by actual scientists.  But go on with your bad self; I’m sure personal experience trumps the real data.  You oughtta mix it with coconut oil and go drink it in a radium mine!
1913 2018-11-05 20:33:05 The minister insists its a start up special vehicle yet its an existing company that has proven beyond any reasonable doubt its unprecedented failure in the oil industry.

1921 2018-11-05 20:32:17 We went over a full decade without a major hurricane hitting the US before last year.  A.  Full.  Decade.  You're a snake oil salesman and people aren't buying your super serial stupidity anymore.  #Stop #TurnYourMansionLightsOff
1922 2018-11-05 20:32:14 LMFAOOO i’m jk i sleep with coconut oil on my ends sometimes
1923 2018-11-05 20:32:13 When coconut oil is  good for your hair but in reality smells so shittyfull on heaved
1924 2018-11-05 20:32:10 Oil + sun + iPhone = Glow
1925 2018-11-05 20:32:07 Low sodium tamari, brown sugar, honey, mirin, sesame oil.
1926 2018-11-05 20:32:07 Why go for olive oil when massage oil has more variety in smell. 
1927 2018-11-05 20:31:51 there’s not anxiety greater than when you’re about to have to drive up on the oil changing tracks. don’t @ me.
1928 2018-11-05 20:31:50 Google is your friend, Gregory. Start with "Wood River Oil and Refining". Either someone's been lying to you or the mushrooms haven't worn off.
1929 2018-11-05 20:31:50 U.S. oil erases gain, ends lower with some nations allowed to keep buying Iranian oil despite sanctions

1931 2018-11-05 20:31:43 I hate having a car. Gas is expensive. Tires are expensive you have to get oil changes, fluids, and filters for different crap. Like kill me
1932 2018-11-05 20:31:38 I need a oil change
1933 2018-11-05 20:31:26 Iran Sanctions and Oil Prices: Who’ll Feel the Pain?
1934 2018-11-05 20:31:25 the bullets that  your taxes    pay for that  go flying  past peoples head in the 3rd world over oil thats what   costs  you not  asylum seekers  buddie  you should  sing a song  hold hands  and embrace the power of do nothings like scott  fearless leader
1935 2018-11-05 20:31:20 Truth, to an extent. However, whether that direction is positive or negative is up to the individual. Some people, actually look at themselves and wonder how much more harm they can inflict. Those are the types of people, this world can do without. Like oil moguls for example.
1936 2018-11-05 20:31:10 1/2 That's what happens when the supply outweighs the demand. The Oil companies never thought of building storage, they were more worried about getting it to market now to maximize profits during high times. Now during low times the won't cut production, but have no storage
1937 2018-11-05 20:31:08 can't do that, the self-driving oil trucks are taking up all the track space
1938 2018-11-05 20:31:06 Everyone wants to be 'Oily' but no one takes time to put the Oil in a Jar and make it constantly available and accessible. What's in the Jar is what will sustain you both spiritually and financially!!! #InTheLongRun #OilyAndWise
1939 2018-11-05 20:31:00 The government of Jordan has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Alexander Ludwig in a barathea wig.
1940 2018-11-05 20:30:46 If you use regular creams it won't effectively moisturize. Think of the oil as a barrier, in order to get past it you'll need something that doesn't mix into it but gets past it enough to hydrate. Oil and water don't mix

1946 2018-11-05 20:30:15 At $70.28 per barrel, we are supposed to be celebrating oil boom, and attain a lot of economic advancement. Instead Buhari and his kinsmen are banking for their unknown generations.
1947 2018-11-05 20:30:15 @wpro @DanYorkeShow Trillo Trillo Trillo. It’s laughable ! The guy hits a 12 year old kid over the head with a caulking gun,uses racist remarks, slaps a guy in the face and then dumps oil on his own property for 25 years ! And you guys keep giving him oxygen!! Only in RI!
1948 2018-11-05 20:30:13 Jesse Who??? Is he the VS Greenie who lectures everyone , driving around in a big SUV saving the world from harmful Gas and Oil  #wannabe
1949 2018-11-05 20:30:09 Oops.  Sorry.
1950 2018-11-05 20:30:03 Missed that oil close. Now 6 red days and counting.
1951 2018-11-05 20:29:55 Indeed! Low maintenence, and no more chain oil marks on my jeans! Perfect commuter.

Now all I need is for Zurich to become a bike city

1953 2018-11-05 20:29:44 I think I saw him in All Saints Garden the other day! He was doing a wonderful oil painting.
1954 2018-11-05 20:29:43 I'm reminded of the story of Jason (golden fleece thief, tho might have been oil ) how he threw a stone amidst the warriors and they fought among themselves. Someone is throwing stones into Scotland btw ;-)
1955 2018-11-05 20:29:39 Oil markets have reacted calmly so far to the sanctions news. But experts say any reduction in output could be disruptive.
1956 2018-11-05 20:29:37 Highways&roads are subsidized not just at federal level at all levels. Of course that doesn't include the hidden subsidies to roads, like wars for oil on false pretenses, the deaths and injuries, the looming toxins in precious fresh water from fracking&,oh yes,that climate change
1957 2018-11-05 20:29:31 Oil
1958 2018-11-05 20:29:26 Bio oil has my skin so clear and smooth  I can’t stop touching my face 
1959 2018-11-05 20:29:22 That was a reply to the guy with three followers that called me a dork
1960 2018-11-05 20:29:13 #SRSP time to get excited new CEO interview on yt.
Drilling defo going ahead and first oil 45 days.
Very bullish of new assets.
1961 2018-11-05 20:29:04 You should add that the money of this oil will be under the control of US to buy food stuff to the Iranian people ..
1962 2018-11-05 20:29:04 Woody, come on. Turn off Fox News. Trump would kill them all and use their land to drill for oil.
1963 2018-11-05 20:29:01 Among other things, Colorado is voting to end slavery for real this time, to keep oil companies as far away from communities as possible, and to tax people who make more than myself and my entire family COMBINED in order to fund things like mental health care and schools. So yeah
1964 2018-11-05 20:28:51 Ok looks like that castor oil glow
1965 2018-11-05 20:28:46 You think anyone supports you @khamenei_ir?  Once your oil income is gone none of the terrorists you fund will help you maintain power.  Your criminal terrorist enterprise is done.  The world knows Mullahs are terrorists! #Iran #Sanctions
1966 2018-11-05 20:28:44 i s2g if this castor oil doesn't make my bald patches grow hair in my beard i'll jump off a cliff

1969 2018-11-05 20:28:31 Sorry to read this Lewis. I just hope tomorrow brings a better day. I also hope the availability of cannabis oil helps those that need it.
1970 2018-11-05 20:28:16 Life to life, my friend.
Also, boiled spring potatoes, good greek olive oil, a squeeze of lemon and some lavender sprigs with flowers make a delightful side for any and all grilled meats.
1971 2018-11-05 20:28:00 Farmers, the Military, oil industry... everyone is getting ready for Climate Change, except the politicians!
1972 2018-11-05 20:27:49 Energy is 25% of your income.  When you buy food, supplies, etc, inside is 25% energy.  My engine can get 80+% of that gone fast.  80% of 25% is 20%.  You will save 20% of your income when fully implemented.  That leaves 5% of goods is energy.   No more oil wars.
1973 2018-11-05 20:27:38 No plastic, oil scum, coral bleaching? Perhaps your son is actually an astronaut exploring another planet.
1974 2018-11-05 20:27:32 Tofu and cooking oil in China must be more expensive, and soy bean farmers in the U.S. lost a great deal.  A loss- loss, thanks to Trump.
1975 2018-11-05 20:26:57 I’m so tired and I really still have to go the gym, cook, oil my scalp & get an episode of Ozark in. one gotta go.

1979 2018-11-05 20:26:41 My husband makes scrambled eggs with mashed bananas. He swears it's like banana pancakes - without the flour (or milk or oil lol).
1980 2018-11-05 20:26:37 Venezuela is having economic issued due to terrible monetary policy, overspending of oil revenues, dependence on aforementioned oil revenues, and various forms of domestic and foreign sabotage

Bernie hasn't proposed any of that
1981 2018-11-05 20:26:37 There’s maps that purport to explain the EU by which countries cook with butter or olive oil, but clearly the really meaningful divide is which countries listen to dour techno, crypto-Nazi metal, or shitty French rap.

-No more abandoned projects
-Contractors getting paid as at when due. 
I appeal to the milenum to look beyond the lies and deceptions, ask them to show pictures of what they have done for 16yrs with oil sold and good will we've had. We cldn't have sufficient power for 16yrs
1987 2018-11-05 20:26:06 Like? Despite the oil and all... A pity
1988 2018-11-05 20:25:55 I actually agree with you 100% snake oil salesman con artist Carl demaio needs to be investigated for fraud on the amount of money he has stolen from the yes on 6 supporters maybe you can make this happen
1989 2018-11-05 20:25:51 Extra rose oil today.
1990 2018-11-05 20:25:47 Suggestion LOL: Iran says they'll resolutely flout sanctions and export oil. MTN should enter into a swap deal w/Iran oil importer and redeem dollars to recoup their money, makes sense that way
1991 2018-11-05 20:25:43 Drive from Oceanside to City Heights just to get an oil change, I’ve had the same mechanic since I started driving, never ever gone to someone else. LOYALTY.
1992 2018-11-05 20:25:42 No he wouldn't. He is a self serving dick and a snake oil salesman of the worst kind. She is merely useless he is something much more dangerous.
1993 2018-11-05 20:25:12 Air Wick oil is stronger than sulfuric acid
1994 2018-11-05 20:25:09 If you're looking for an everyday olive oil that doesn’t break the bank but maintains the quality, The Greek Kitchen Extra Virgin Olive Oil has been created with you in mind. It’s mellow flavour and light consistency makes it perfect for salads, marinating and slow cooking.
1995 2018-11-05 20:25:06 3. The ESA forces the oil companies to find alternatives which will have less of an impact. Some companies act without regard to the environment. The ESA keeps corporate polluters in check.
1996 2018-11-05 20:25:04 Strong representation for both. Also I like the transferability... I wouldn’t use the beard oil, but everything else on that list is also on my Christmas list haha
1997 2018-11-05 20:24:53 Who will be my anon that will tear me oil block?!
1998 2018-11-05 20:24:51 How can you forget about George W. Bush 2 terms? He constantly put us in debt spending trillions in War that never existed in the Middle East. Instead stealing oil & opioid the whole entire time. If you want to know the truth? You need to start listening to veterans & soldiers.
1999 2018-11-05 20:24:42 Good evening. Ahead of the coming #EIAReport, the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR) has shed only (potentially) 235,000 barrels over the past week down to 654.7M. This is taxpayer oil that is sold to commercial entities; hence added to commercial storage/use. #OOTT

2003 2018-11-05 20:24:34 One advice pour hot oil on your leg and shout for help they will all forget the plantain... let me know if it works olè omo 
2004 2018-11-05 20:24:31 Plain truth
2005 2018-11-05 20:24:19 His mistake.  Iraq is NOT buying oil from Iran but export...that is stopped already.
2006 2018-11-05 20:24:02 Oil is just dinosaur juice
2007 2018-11-05 20:23:41 “they hinge so much upon so little” — my grandma, on essential oil enthusiasts
2008 2018-11-05 20:23:33 Iraq is NOT buying oil from Iran but export.  That is already stopped from kirkuk.
2009 2018-11-05 20:23:32 Shale Oil will be around for several decades. However, the thought of uninterrupted US Shale growth, unlimited Tier 1’s and the big 3 Shale plays in the US as the swing producer ends soon.

2011 2018-11-05 20:23:29 tbh i changed my entire diet/basically stopped drinking all together bc of belly issues. that 100% was the push i needed but now that its been 6months i don’t miss anything. for anxiety & tough days CBD oil has been my savior. surround yourself w people who support you & u got it
2012 2018-11-05 20:23:10 Will you support the people's choice for speaker? @Jim_Jordan
2013 2018-11-05 20:23:07 Coooooool my car needs $900 of work today on top of my oil change and tires  #fml
2014 2018-11-05 20:22:49 Washington Carbon Tax could certainly be interesting if we get it passed. The fact that BP says they support a carbon tax but are opposed to this particular carbon tax, and the vast sums the oil industry are dumping into a state ballot measure, speaks volumes.
2015 2018-11-05 20:22:45 U rub anointing oil for face, u dey shout Melanin. Oponu
2016 2018-11-05 20:22:42 Oil is better...just make sure it’s CBD not THC...(check doses)
2017 2018-11-05 20:22:35 one time the oil leaked into my lanyard strap and then when I put it in my purse it ate through the plastic on my headphones. #skrong
2018 2018-11-05 20:22:13 Exempt for oil. This is a blatant disregard of all other sanctions. Typical Erdogan, when any country backs down on one issue, he moves against them on others. US needs to send him a strong warning, maybe sanctions that will cripple the lira once again.
2019 2018-11-05 20:22:12 2. Take the Right Whale. Oil companies want to use sonic blastic to search for oil reserves in Right Whale habitat along East Coast. Research has shown the blasting is detrimental to whales and Marine Mammals
2020 2018-11-05 20:22:09 For the earth to still be livable 100 years from now some very drastic but needed changes must be made one being stopping oil usage fully, it will be hard and if its done at a surprise a lot of people will die but for the sake of humanity few people is not huge
2021 2018-11-05 20:21:56 It just seems weird to me that scientists say oil is so deep in the ground, and yet Jed Clampett fired his rifle into a swimming hole, which probably penetrated mere inches, and up from the ground came a bubblin' crude.
2022 2018-11-05 20:21:55 oo fast eh 
same here the oil all the way
2023 2018-11-05 20:21:49 the customs union is consistent tax to ensure minimum standards and adjustable industrial hardship funds for societal gain; not arbitrary price adjustment at the whims of the private sector oil commodity futures who aren't leaving the treasury post QE without putting up a fight.
2024 2018-11-05 20:21:45 Iran is the new swing producer controlled by Trump, oil too high lessen sanctions oil too low tightnen them.
2025 2018-11-05 20:21:43 Kkkkkk hhhhhhh last joke bfo I sleep. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump hie. I just wanted to tell u we hv discovered oil in Zim.... N we may like to trade with Iran....

2030 2018-11-05 20:21:11 Oil. Our children will be killed in Iran because Putin wants us to get the oil. They made the plans for it when trump and Putin met up last time. It's all about oil. Niger, Venezuela, Iran.
2031 2018-11-05 20:20:50 I just heard about a week ago that Soros donated his money into his organizations that support his globalist movement. Soros has all his machines oiled & in motion. Don't worry..Trump is holding the oil can & will stop him.

2036 2018-11-05 20:20:16 My skin gets really dry around this time of year and no matter the lotion or body wash the only thing that's helps is baby oil, so god bless baby oil.
2037 2018-11-05 20:20:14 The funniest part is, the US produces more oil than any other country per year
2038 2018-11-05 20:20:14 If you add more good fats to your diet, you will crave sugar less. Avocados. Olive Oil. Nuts
2039 2018-11-05 20:20:14 I WAS LIKE. SWALLOW THE OIL????
2040 2018-11-05 20:20:11 maybe? it all goes back to product managers. If you are building a product, things should be spec'd out. To say its the developers fault is like saying its your mechanics fault when you go to him with a roasted motor because you forgot oil
2041 2018-11-05 20:20:02 I steal the coconut oil from my mom so I’m not sure but it’s in this massive jar, and it is A LOT OF OIL! Tea tree the one I get is K120 but you can get it WAAAAAAYYY cheaper at umoyo, maybe even K30
2042 2018-11-05 20:19:49 Oprah preached identity hate while in Marietta, GA.  Cobb County ain't NEVER gonna buy THAT.  She ACTUALLY talked LYNCHINGS, if you can believe that being done TODAY then I've got some desert real estate without oil or oasis you'll want!

2062 2018-11-05 20:18:10 The Mullahs occupation of #Iran is done!

These #Sanctions are for the world to acknowledge Mullahs are nothing more than terrorists using oil revenues to fund global terrorism!

2063 2018-11-05 20:18:10 we have to retrieve and ship EV battery components too. Refining oil for fuel also produces many other necessary products that are needed across all industries. 50% of power is low carbon "on average" - any extra comes from fossil fuels, you fail to grasp this.

2065 2018-11-05 20:17:54 Frum isn't a liberal though. He is a neo-liberal.  And populism is a direct reaction to the snake oil he sells.

When inequality and despair increase society goes one of two ways: socialist or fascist. 

So reform neo-liberalism to be slight more socialist or enjoy your fascism.

2080 2018-11-05 20:16:22 Its people are being killed by Paul Biya everyday and all the oil in that country is being taken by Paul and his Franch associates but Nigeria being the big brother in Ecowas they are quite about it.
2081 2018-11-05 20:16:03 LoL BS , hes already giving wavers to Countrys so they can take Iran Oil now hes say " slower on iran oil sactions"  so they are still profiting...Straight out lie , or did you not get the memo

2083 2018-11-05 20:15:55 We were on our way to vacation and hit a deep hole and knocked a hole in the bottom of the oil pan. so now we need to figure out what to do to get us home
2084 2018-11-05 20:15:54 Yes, scrape seeds out, put oil & some seasoning, herbs etc on. Wrap in foil & roast about 50 mins. When done flesh will scoop out easily for soup. BTW you can roast seeds to for a snack with the g&t you now need x
2085 2018-11-05 20:15:50 There is a guy in Colorado who made a drink called that. It’s like a cheap meal replacement. That’s what we will be “eating” when the farmland is dry and the forests are gone and the oceans are filled with oil and pollution. Nestle bottled water and Soylent Green

2093 2018-11-05 20:15:16 bottles of oil compete with each other; sidewalks compete with each other; therefore sidewalks are bottles of oil
2094 2018-11-05 20:15:08 Right now the trend is mixed to slightly bullish, light volume & a lot of divergence... for example oil stocks up big today, Crude down on the day... we like to see harmony in the market, better odds for trend trading.

2107 2018-11-05 20:13:41 Turkey isn't in the middle of a water crisis, Iran is. Turkey was also buying oil from ISIS, Iran wasn't. There are plenty of legit criticisms to be made of the Iranian regime, especially as an Iraqi, but spewing out fabricated points created by Saudi think-tanks aren't the way.

2177 2018-11-05 20:07:56 You raise an interesting phenomenon -- oil rich countries that want to pursue nuclear power. We can add Saudi Arabia to the list. Would be interesting to read more about that.

2181 2018-11-05 20:07:03 Where does one get the tea tree oil?
2182 2018-11-05 20:06:59 Not necessarily, smarter and credible retailers would encourage shoppers to increase their basket to deserve a unit of cooking oil
2183 2018-11-05 20:06:50 Oh yes, or you can slice it & roast it then skin comes off easily. I've nearly cut my arm off trying to cut the damn things raw! Put a little oil on flesh(no need if whole) & wrap in foil. 160°Fan is all I know. Mind you leek & potato is v nice too x
2184 2018-11-05 20:06:48 The 1.7T you're quoting isn't tax revenue. It's value to the oil companies if they extract it all at high prices. Alberta won't see more than a couple percentage points of that as royalties and will be saddled with the clean up costs. Only Big Oil benefits.
2185 2018-11-05 20:06:45 I’m working on orchestrating data from the Carbon Majors Database on the top 25 oil and gas companies ranked by emissions, and wow, it’s a bit depressing.

Data Sonification is a wild thing, y’all.

2206 2018-11-05 20:05:02 I bet justin biebers car broke down bc he doesnt get his oil changed
2207 2018-11-05 20:05:00 Got the lower unit gear oil changed in #KyndaCabby's motor. The oil in there didn't seem too bad looking and no signs of water infiltration. The drain and fill plugs weren't frozen so this is something that may have happened regularly... Or at least once before. A good sign.
2208 2018-11-05 20:04:55 Agree completely about how sickening it is to see Obama still out there shilling his snake oil salesmen lies to bleating liberal sheep in the (dwindling) audiences.  And he does look demented in the eyes (the gateway to the soul, as they say).  He needs our prayers.
2209 2018-11-05 20:04:38 Gonna fade Trump: $CL
this is the best he can do. China stimulus + DXY Cool off = good for real activity in the rest of the world and thus oil. a recovering demand story should offset the maxed out iran narrative.

2220 2018-11-05 20:03:53 @realDonaldTrump Good, you are going slow on Iran oil sanctions until we KNOW that we have added supplies to make up for the 2M barrels that go away from the market when the Iran Oil Sanctions go into full effect
2221 2018-11-05 20:03:50 So I’m getting my oil changed at Toyota, and as the guy goes out to tag my car 3 guys came up to him and all said “I want to work on this car” they don’t even know what I’m here for but they jus wanna drive the Challenger 
2222 2018-11-05 20:03:44 And if Iran sanctions push oil higher $bhge will rise with oil and the value will continue  to rise $ge will not hit $5, if it did Buffet comes in and buys a massive stake in $ge

So 85B a year royalties into Alberta Gov account? Try less than 3% of that in a good year, with a guaranteed decline over time.

2291 2018-11-05 19:57:59 Idk I’m getting an oil change rn lmao but I’ll probably head up right after!!! Sooooooo 3? 4?
2292 2018-11-05 19:57:59 Excuse me sir but did you even consider that aioli and mayonnaise both use oil and eggs?
2293 2018-11-05 19:57:55 Los Angeles has many places to unload oil Why are oil cos. charging L.A. $5 a gallon, double what some others pay.
2294 2018-11-05 19:57:46 you know it’s bad when you go to pick up your car after an oil change and the lady makes the  face
2295 2018-11-05 19:57:44 Canadian oil producers are throttling back production amid the worst pipeline bottleneck and biggest regional discounts in at least a decade.

2308 2018-11-05 19:55:57 Monday + CBD oil = success!
2309 2018-11-05 19:55:51 When I make chicken and sausage gumbo, I use 3/4c oil to 3/4c flour, stirred to dark chocolate brown, and two cartons of chix broth, which I think is 64oz. That is thick, and then I add water until the consistency is right. I like a little file' at the end, too.
2310 2018-11-05 19:55:46 It's a misapplication and inefficient utilization of capital largely. 100% of Trillions flow into an area roughly 20 miles square, then flow back to the source at a vastly reduced rate with conditions, restrictions, inhibiting effective application further
2311 2018-11-05 19:55:30 Hey Jordan! We actually do use rapeseed oil in our products. It's another name for canola (but is more commonly called rapeseed in Sweden, where we're from). The kind we use is non-GMO, expeller pressed, and low in erucic acid. Hope this clears things up!

2325 2018-11-05 19:54:21 Incorrect. It's grown mainly for oil.... the livestock are fed the byproducts which while technically the bulk of the product is no the reason for growth.
2326 2018-11-05 19:54:19 Libya has a plethora of wealth- some of the best oil in the world-yet only 3 million inhabitants. The USA took out Khadafi- and ISIS moved in. Its in a very strategic location-along the Mediterranean, close to Europe, a gateway to Southern Africa, and other trade points as wel.

2391 2018-11-05 19:48:24 Now for real issue.  What is going on with Iran oil imbargo?  You allow about ten countries including China continue to buy oil from Iran without penalty.  China is the largest importer of oil and consume just as much as Iran can produce.  Is that effective or just giving them —-

2394 2018-11-05 19:48:19 Getting my oil changed right now and just learned some fun facts:
• my car was out of oil
• you’re supposed to check the oil
• the last time I got my oil changed was 13,000 miles ago
2395 2018-11-05 19:48:11 Russia? Aging population, complete dependency on oil and gas export which will loose value rapidly and a completely corrupt government.

2398 2018-11-05 19:47:59 Why would the imported gas stop, as countries are keeping oil production steady, which means gas, and worldwide supplies are said to last 75 years
2399 2018-11-05 19:47:58 wth is wrong with oil?

2408 2018-11-05 19:47:10 If you have a diffuser, just diffuse the oil with a bit of water mixed in the top. If not, simmer some water on the stove with some of the oil in it. My mother would tell you to put a towel over your head & literally breathe it in, but your mileage will vary. Feel better!!
2409 2018-11-05 19:47:07 That’s a lot of ifs.
In the mean time, if the US stopped meddling, Russia and China would step into that power vacuum and could affect global oil prices or change the global currency and the US economy would crash, bringing the western world down with it.
2410 2018-11-05 19:47:06 We don’t want oil for vehicles anymore.......
2411 2018-11-05 19:47:04 China should denounce It's treatment of uighurs, of your buying oil from Iran, that means you don't have problems with Islam so why the whole targeting of Muslims in the North? Land, control and typical human nonsense.

2480 2018-11-05 19:41:20 i think Europe turned out well enough. But 'staying' is a problem - cost, life, and basically subjugating a society to external ideals. In the meantime oil companies (M.E.) and gold mines are profited by 3rd party (U.A.). Israel & Syria's Golan H. Seems little incentive to leave

2517 2018-11-05 19:38:04 Sigh. You are  confusing Nat'l Parks with the Nat'l Forests. They are Nat'l so the resources there would not be dominated and controlled by a few companies but would be made available for the good of the nation. That includes timber and oil. No one can touch the Nat'l Parks.
2518 2018-11-05 19:37:57 Interested to see how you get on. We tried the oil on one of our dogs (11 year old Springer) didn’t do anything for her anxiety with fireworks but seemed to help her joints a little. What strength and dosage are you using ?
2519 2018-11-05 19:37:57 Tubby, grubby and buys her skincare from the 'excess oil problems' end of the shelf. I see her with dark undyed hair, though. Hair dye - "too much faffin', Tom! D'you want me hogging the bathroom?!" Cos she can never miss a dig.

2524 2018-11-05 19:37:30 The natural question in a country that boasts the world's largest proven oil reserves is, how did it come to this? Many have latched on to a simple answer: socialism. But is it really that simple?

2562 2018-11-05 19:34:25 They did it with Iraq and it happened. If the Trump administration will be tough enough and open a channel to get food and medicine in exchange for oil, the overall condition of people even could be better. this economic crisis kickstarted despite Obama's money.

2621 2018-11-05 19:30:51 Right now all I’m putting in it is cantu leave in conditioner, organic coconut oil, and the Shea moisture styling lotion. The curls come out really stiff & makes my hair look dry. I also wash with cantu naturals
2622 2018-11-05 19:30:45 You know and they said Kingdom Come Deliverance was buggy... I've gotten way more bugs and glitches on this RDR2 then I did in KCD.

Currently got my two horses carrying stolen oil stuck in a tree, meaning I have to restart the mission AGAIN. Never had this in KCD.
2623 2018-11-05 19:30:35 Nope. Try it warm with some olive oil as well

2627 2018-11-05 19:30:15 This statement is underrated ”Human capital would be the new oil”.
2628 2018-11-05 19:30:14 Not a fan either, but playing by conventional rules, being rational and fair only works if your adversary accepts and operates using the same principles. Chinese agenda is clearly not in alignment
2629 2018-11-05 19:30:10 And oil. Iranian oil will be sold to Turkey and Turkey will sell it to the US, just as Turkey sold to the US the Iraqi oil stolen by ISIS.

2633 2018-11-05 19:29:44 I never met someone in the oil companies I worked for that said they voted Democrat. Beto is speaking to those people, not assuming they don’t know their own self-interest. Cruz is running ads against him on that.
2634 2018-11-05 19:29:27 When you head out intending to only buy an essential oil blend or two and end up buying a sample pack of tea and a bottle of wine... Self care right?
2635 2018-11-05 19:29:23 crude carnival! $ES_F #oil
2636 2018-11-05 19:29:19 So does oil bring  money or my assumption is wrong ??

2639 2018-11-05 19:29:07 Some people are so easily fooled....Trump is a very efficient salesperson though is void of any ethics for the sale. In other words, a snake oil salesman.
2640 2018-11-05 19:28:45 i dont put coconut oil on my face thats jus me lmao
2641 2018-11-05 19:28:43 @realDonaldTrump How dumb do you get?
1: Iran give China and other major holders of $US notice
2: Huge asset buying spree using $US cash
3: Iran sells it's oil in Euros
1, 2, 3 $US tanks!
I'm a no nothing nobody and have worked this one out on my own!
2642 2018-11-05 19:28:17 I have a fryer, I used to do em like that every year. Stopped after I quit working at a restaurant and had access to an oil dump and industrial dishwasher.
2643 2018-11-05 19:28:06 I done the same
2644 2018-11-05 19:27:52 Sitting and waiting while you’re getting an oil change is agonizing time literally doesn’t move
2645 2018-11-05 19:27:43 Gonna buy myself some fish oil capsules tomorrow, i’m not fucking with this 5 eggs a day nonsense
2646 2018-11-05 19:27:37 Question is why is tuna in water even a thing  oil all the way tyvm
2647 2018-11-05 19:27:28 You guys love war n stuff, eh? Poor men sent to die for rich men and oil. I shan't be glorifying this rubbish
2648 2018-11-05 19:27:10 Id say leave the oil where Westmonster can’t touch it
2649 2018-11-05 19:27:07 RIGHT. "You say that now but when you're older..." Kindly hop off oil don't be treated as such a commodity to not want children, and shouldn't be assumed that someone WILL have them.
2650 2018-11-05 19:26:55 US Secretary of State #MikePompeo says, 8 countries including #India have been exempted from the US sanctions for buying #Iranian oil.
2651 2018-11-05 19:26:48 I went to meineke to get my oil changed once. They told me one price, then called me & said they’d have to charge me more & i couldn’t opt out cuz they’d already started the work. The partner pulled up and cursed everyone the fuck out lmao
2652 2018-11-05 19:26:37 3, e no gree devalue Naira as our oil sales wey be our main foreign market drop sotay Naira come begin devalue itsef up to $500, inflation come creep in. Life come tough for Naija.
2653 2018-11-05 19:26:33 it's almost like all three are split between snake oil and boring incremental improvements on existing stuff, but that don't attract investors
2654 2018-11-05 19:26:30 You bet  What type of oil? 
2655 2018-11-05 19:26:27 Can you use any type of oil moisturizer/primer?
2656 2018-11-05 19:26:18 So cute how my mum thinks I would actually bring out money to buy this oil I never asked for. Lawl.
2657 2018-11-05 19:26:07 I dunno jak try it! I could imagine ‘castor oil’ to work though that stuff is wicked!!
2658 2018-11-05 19:26:04 Then I wish I was oily then , ya know oil is a very profitable export
2659 2018-11-05 19:25:45 I waited 2 hours for an oil change....
2660 2018-11-05 19:25:44 I do this too and I wish u could get high from peppermint oil
2661 2018-11-05 19:25:39 The markets are marking time this week, with mid-term elections tomorrow and USDA & Fed on Thursday, behind today's sanctions on Iran. Crude oil is up 0.5 - 1%, The DOW is up 0.8%, while the NASDAQ is down 0.8%. corn up 3, beans dn 2, wheat dn 2 #oatt
2662 2018-11-05 19:25:27 is there, like, an essential oil i can apply to my face to stop it from turning THAT RED whenever a DROP of attention is placed on me?
2663 2018-11-05 19:25:26 I wanna make an oil painting but I’m scared :(
2664 2018-11-05 19:25:25 I"m coming up on Bloomberg radio with @carolmassar to discuss #IranSanctions, exemptions, oil & what we can expect from Iran in a few minutes #OOTT
2665 2018-11-05 19:25:24 shall we compare these subsidies against the billions over decades to the fossil fuel industry in alberta alone?
we wouldn't even know how to extract oil from bitumen without tax payer dollars funding the research. where's our royalties from the licensing of that technology?
2666 2018-11-05 19:25:13 I really hate it when TV or radio shows feature people who have no knowledge of the inner workings of govt, or any field.
Can someone like her give a sound analysis on the reason HSBC & UBS pulled out of Nigeria? Or of anything finance-related, security, Oil, etc? Why featur her?
2667 2018-11-05 19:25:06 @VWUKHelp any idea when my Haldex oil change is due? 2016 golf R
2668 2018-11-05 19:25:05 Here, I think we're talking abt education which I believe shud b a priority 4 d govtm
Even we don't have oil as our naturalresources, there r a lot of countries without aving oil as their naturalresources,& still takes education as their priority 4 citizens to av a free education
2669 2018-11-05 19:24:59 The main reason Revenge is scary as fuck is that it has the same explosiveness factor as, say, G&W Oil, but with less set-up restrictions, and more freedom.
2670 2018-11-05 19:24:54 Olive oil leave in conditioner  will help with the frizz
2671 2018-11-05 19:24:53 The oil that they use to make the chips smells like the playdough you had to make at home in grade 3, idk bout y’all but that don’t sound safe to consume
2672 2018-11-05 19:24:53 The ad is run by IPAA--International Petroleum Association of America headed by Micheal Watford who always seems to be bankrupting oil companies & Barry Russell, author of the op piece, ”Good riddance to Obama’s gas flaring rule.” in the (shock!) Washington Examiner (cough) ...
2673 2018-11-05 19:24:51 Probably "Tesla's are human traps waiting to perform a mass genocide. Electrocution is an added risk. Elon Musk is a dum dum who got extra crafty with toy batteries."

Paid for by oil and gas.
2674 2018-11-05 19:24:49 Man, you guys sure are stuck on how oil is moved through pipelines and not how the oil industry is killing the planet which was my point seeing as how Jeff claims he supports people who are the voice of the outdoors.
2675 2018-11-05 19:24:40 Lol it’s like some type of tradition or something.. My mom would NEVER cook red oil on Sundays! Someone pls explain to us why!! 
2676 2018-11-05 19:24:39 Olive oil ecostyler or the flaxseed one or the pink one lol
2677 2018-11-05 19:24:09 Bruh it really dont take this long to do a fucking oil change
2678 2018-11-05 19:24:02 Mixed olive oil, garlic paste, ginger paste, & tandoori masala powder. rubbed on both sides of the cauliflower. Low heat in the oven for 50 mins, turning over at halfway point. then a squeeze of lemon. Was ace.
2679 2018-11-05 19:23:59 اقول ولي العهد محمد بن سلمان والله مايدري عنكم جالس يدشن مشاريع وانتم جالسين تنابحون ههههههه
2680 2018-11-05 19:23:37 So Scotlands oil is funding the UKs brexit budget, wtf, get Scotland out this shambles
2681 2018-11-05 19:23:16 The exchange rate has stabilized - so why the increase.?
The oil price is down with about 10 dollar - so why the increase.?


2682 2018-11-05 19:23:03 And now I'm picturing Philia putting suntan oil on Rain's back at the beach.

Under appreciated girls have to stick together.
2683 2018-11-05 19:23:00 I think it's weird that you appreciate nature so much and animals and their right to be here as much as us yet the party side with the most doesn't give a shit. Oil executives running the EPA, really?
2684 2018-11-05 19:22:50 Have you ever had x-rays? or had blood work done to see if your organs are functioning properly?  My daughter has/had terrible pain in her ribs.  Never really sorted it out, but it did get better with time.  Thoughts are with you. (try CBD oil?)
2685 2018-11-05 19:22:42 Omfg same sis 1 new tire turned into 2 new tires oil change alignment and new battery $700 sis I need a shot of tequila STAT
2686 2018-11-05 19:22:40 The beginning of the end of the oil $
2687 2018-11-05 19:22:25 It smells like Hot 6 Oil by the elevators.
2688 2018-11-05 19:22:21 What i recommend is after the shower:
1) Towel dry ur beard
2) Put beard balm on your beard (and maybe some days beard oil) and use your fingers to really get it in there
3) Use a comb and a hair dryer on warm to straighten it out
4)Put the dryer on cold to "freeze" it into place
2689 2018-11-05 19:22:05 "Down looking for crude oil" You really got me iswr.
And I really can't bliv with your performance thus far. Although dnt forget that I'm still ur master, eventually I will be the oga at the top.
2690 2018-11-05 19:21:38 There probably is, I always thought it was a rule congo people made up but I could be wrong. Either way I eating palm oil any day of the week lol
2691 2018-11-05 19:21:34 Nope, just the oil.
2692 2018-11-05 19:21:24 Just bought #Iranian #oil 
Screw the #sanctions, screw the U.S. and screw dipshit moron @realdonaldtrump big time!!!

2693 2018-11-05 19:20:56 We would recommend rubbing the rust off with some wire wool and then oil thoroughly. 
2694 2018-11-05 19:20:48 Answer : 4. Mustard Oil

2711 2018-11-05 19:18:59 Wig...I’ll try to remember to get olive oil during my next grocery trip 
2712 2018-11-05 19:18:57 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。
2713 2018-11-05 19:18:47 So some people have been rubbing anointing oil on their face and calling it melanin poppin.
2714 2018-11-05 19:18:43 He doesn’t want to drive up the price of oil so that gas prices won’t go up since people will blame his irresponsible rhetoric. It’s all about Don.
2715 2018-11-05 19:18:36 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for SoulCycle, and put some spiced chai essential oil in my diffuser.
2716 2018-11-05 19:18:35 Oil! A palavra mágica!
2717 2018-11-05 19:18:34 Oil.
2718 2018-11-05 19:18:25 getting a vape pen for CBD oil was the best decision i’ve ever made. my anxiety has been cut down more than 70%. my nausea is limited! a bitch is thriving.
2719 2018-11-05 19:18:10 Olive oil is the trick! Takes it right off, moisturizes, and doesn’t clog pores.
2720 2018-11-05 19:18:06 My neighbors are reporting a sheen and there's no way to remove each microliter of fuel/oil. Request emergency funding to remove the vessel. It's an enviro hazard and a hazard to nav. If this was in the Narrows, you'd have found the $ yesterday. We're being treated as unimportant
2721 2018-11-05 19:18:01 Good Greed Almighty! ALL so the OIL'igarchs can get their greasy palms on other nations' resources. When it comes to their corruption, there's no bottom to the barrel. And we taxpayers fund their "security guards"…!?! Wake UP, sheeple!
2722 2018-11-05 19:17:53 In an effort to end Tehran’s missile and nuclear program also to stop Mullah’s Regime influences in the Middle East.The United States is restoring Sanction on Iran’s Oil ,Banking and transport.#IranRegimeChange #FreeIran2018
2723 2018-11-05 19:17:44 Hahahahahahahah we are so fucked bc of Iran sanctions bc regional economists are all expecting the dollar to collapse within 5 months. Bc since oil is purchased in dollar, it keeps the value stable so Iran will find a new country probably Russia to start purchasing oil in their
2724 2018-11-05 19:17:39 Still surprised XLE holding this strong without much of a move in oil. Money coming out of large NQ names has to go somewhere, I suppose.

2727 2018-11-05 19:17:20 #USA re-imposes #sanctions on #Iran. Exceptions for 8 counties importing #oil from Iran. Very intense day for #exportcontrol officers, manager and counsels.
2728 2018-11-05 19:17:19 It is unfortunate that India needs a waiver from US to buy oil from Iran. Sad state of affairs. No reaction from Gov? Bulling ....
2729 2018-11-05 19:17:16 No such thing as “tar sands” just a made up word by GreenCrap!  It is “Oil Sands”...no tar anywhere to be found...actually it is “Bitumen”...go read a bit.   And do you think moving crude products via rail past your families and rivers is good or safe? Wake up!
2730 2018-11-05 19:17:13 So I’m in the market for dawn dish soap to help clean an oil stain on my luggage, do I get the Dawn Soap with the duck on it (because of their old commercials) or the one that says 4X Grease cleaning power? #help

2742 2018-11-05 19:15:50 Detroit is a dump because when the Oil Embargo hit in the 70's the Big Three automakers didn't resign their cars to get better gas mileage and thus lost most of their sales to Japanese cars.  Who ran those American car companies?  Republicans.

2757 2018-11-05 19:14:19 @ChrisLawSNP Awful news about Michelin. Given the size of workforce, will the government allow them to access the Transition Training Fund that was originally created for the Oil and Gas sector?

2794 2018-11-05 19:10:11 Turkey, the second worst country for people who tell the truth (aka journalists). Saudi Arabia is the worst, a vile country with a vile society, and a vile warped version of their religion. But they have oil, so all is forgiven, right? Oil has a shelf life, thankfully.

2818 2018-11-05 19:08:03 Yeah jobs at MAC D’s,

Oh, wait: Oil and arms deals 
2849 2018-11-05 19:05:47 Further, we lose a lot by using generators. The cost of buying one, maintenance, fuel, engine oil per annum runs into billions of US Dollars nation-wide. The fumes from the generators also contribute to depletion of the Ozone Layer. It adds to Air Pollution and death.

2865 2018-11-05 19:03:54 Well, that was certainly mighty white of the Trump Regime to grant oil buying privileges to a select few countries. 
2866 2018-11-05 19:03:51 Please don’t forget that twitter is an echo chamber and just because all your liberal friends are posting “I voted” sticker selfies *does not* mean we’re in the clear. EVERYONE NEEDS TO VOTE! Because the oil companies and neo nazis and men’s rights activists certainly will
2867 2018-11-05 19:03:51 The only things Trump is beating Obama in are the amount of pollution, air particulates, CO2 emissions, oil and chemical spills, and healthcare fraud. Yep, Trump is winning at destroying our health and our planet!

"When the price for oil goes up on the markets, it goes right up, but it never goes down."

— PolitiFact National on Tuesday, July 25th, 2017

FALSE STATEMENT
2881 2018-11-05 19:01:47 Just like China should be forced to stop buying oil from North America.
2882 2018-11-05 19:01:46 Prices have not tanked. What has is Alberta’s ability to get oil to market. Encana moved its headquarters to US.  A tell-tale sign.
2883 2018-11-05 19:01:45 I have anxiety and scoliosis; CBD oil provides me relief for both! Just 2 drops and I feel like a brand new bitch  I also believe in the antibiotic properties of CBD as I've yet to get sick this season, meanwhile most pple I know have a cold rn
2884 2018-11-05 19:01:33 Well it’s great for indian economy. A large amount of imported oil will be paid in rupees and in return Iran needs to buy indian products. What could be better than this for India
2885 2018-11-05 19:01:23 The reason for this is so Iran cannot sell there oil forcing Countries to have to buy there oil from USA which is much dearer as is there shale gas
2886 2018-11-05 19:01:21 At some point, given the gargantuan impacts of these false claims, there needs to be the beginnings of legal (and financial) consequences. It's so snake oil salesmen, it needs to be run out of town.
2887 2018-11-05 19:01:20 It’s hard to negotiate with anyone that thinks you are satan. It’s hard to trust Iran when it  pursues  “peaceful” nuclear power when it sits on top of a lake of oil and untold potential for solar energy.  To sanction them in order to negotiate a deal. Seems implausible.
2888 2018-11-05 19:01:20 Ha ha ha facts and CNN are like oil and water
2889 2018-11-05 19:01:16 Im not sure what youre getting at. You say, 'teams getting roughed up doesnt happen' and then next thing say Flames fans should suck it up because all skilled players get hacked and whacked? Im lost.

2894 2018-11-05 19:01:03 lol. Permit? Think we'll cut every little tree off the side of that hill over there, drag them down next to buddies house, collect everything in town that will burn, get 5 gallons of oil/gas and light it up into a big jesus ol blaze. Permit that will ya...

Righties like it for Biblical prophecy but more bc of investments & it's a colonial outpost over oil rich ME

2915 2018-11-05 18:59:20 I forgot I was supposed to getting my oil changed and my nails done
2916 2018-11-05 18:59:19 Makes sense: @JustinWelby was an oil executive before he (imperfectly) saw the Light
2917 2018-11-05 18:59:18 at the dealership to get my oil changed and an old man stopped me and said “young lady I just have to ask you how you keep so pretty, you sure are a pretty one”  cryin
2918 2018-11-05 18:59:10 Ko what happened to oil yekwa Muzarabani ?? 
2919 2018-11-05 18:59:10 You never saw me pumping UKOG all that time ago, I was invested long before then and after being in this oil investment game since the early 1980s I know enough that you make your investment and wait it out for the big returns. It can take years but I understand that and do ok.
2920 2018-11-05 18:58:46 No oil, no pressure.... look boss I fixed it!!!!
2921 2018-11-05 18:58:33 Yo Elon. I'm your biggest fan. I Really like how you're tryna fuck up the oil boys. That's some next level flex
2922 2018-11-05 18:58:29 Just got told I look like a horse girl by a group of older gentleman while getting my oil changed after they asked what I do for work and I told them
2923 2018-11-05 18:58:21 if there's anything, olive oil has even become more rancid.
2924 2018-11-05 18:58:14 CRB index has set its low; oil most likely too -- energy stocks are to deliver most
2925 2018-11-05 18:58:12 @CoriumSkincare Rosehip seed oil smells amazing 
2926 2018-11-05 18:57:57 We are edging away from burning fossil fuels.. but remember oil is used for far more products as well.. like every plastic bottle in your house for starters.
2927 2018-11-05 18:57:55 The USA Is Now So Weak They Have To Consent To India And China To Import Oil From Iran - Already Two Years Ago India Announced They Will Do As They Like. Congrats And Score For India !
2928 2018-11-05 18:57:38 If elected Joe Cunningham will NOT do what he says with regard to oil rigs off our coast in South Carolina!!In classic Democrat fashion he will join the other Democrats at the expense of the nation.

2942 2018-11-05 18:56:29 tell ya what, I will help you out. the three areas with the largest employment under Obama were Part time minimum wage jobs, Government jobs, and Oil and gas industry. First two don't really help much so tell me how he helped oil and gas grow.
2943 2018-11-05 18:56:28 Yes let's go back to typewriters and oil lamps ! Give me one of those that affects you ?
2944 2018-11-05 18:56:21 Having them use the oil revenue to invest in US and buy arms.
2945 2018-11-05 18:56:20 Ben, if you cared at all about the Republican Party's future you'd be pushing for a blue wave.

But we know all you really care about is appearance fees and selling snake oil.
2946 2018-11-05 18:56:19 Joe “if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor” Biden would know all about lying wouldn’t he?
2947 2018-11-05 18:56:07 Not disagreeing about oil scenario, but please think back to time. Hussein had tried to grab Kuwait, gave OBL sanctuary and then starts in with all the weaponry they had & ready to fight. Intel was not perfect, no missles found, but traces of bio & chem weaponry found.
2948 2018-11-05 18:55:59 I don't give the hippies that much credit, the reality was that big oil and coal saw their chance to go for the neck of nuclear power and took it. That manifested in lobbying and fake news scaremongering because the media companies probably aren't too far removed from oil money.
2949 2018-11-05 18:55:53 I think it’s odd that they’re pork-barreling an indoor vaping constraint alongside banning offshore oil drilling, but I’d rather see offshore oil drilling banned than argue the political semantics.
2950 2018-11-05 18:55:49 I tried drinking water recently. Overrated. As for the Truffle oil... It's a clear sign that we're still in austerity.
2951 2018-11-05 18:55:28 Whoever came up with the idea of creating body oil is a genius, that thing is necessary for the skin, nkare it has healing powers . I feel so alright after application 
2952 2018-11-05 18:55:26 Its to do with the oil and changeover shifts during week apparently
2953 2018-11-05 18:55:24 It’s basically the use of a skin care product (a toner) that helps remove further debris, oil and dirt that could be missed by face washing. But make sure it’s an alcohol free toner.

2955 2018-11-05 18:55:12 They unofficially sale their oil to all neighbours,like we have in Balochistan. Even in SITE area KARACHI.
2956 2018-11-05 18:55:09 Since I’ve been in the oil fields all I eat is sandwiches where’s the steak and potatoes at ??!?
2957 2018-11-05 18:55:03 it’s just a link to coconut oil
2958 2018-11-05 18:55:00 Bir kez daha ölüm-sıtma çıkmazı: (Bloomberg) --“On oil we want to go a little bit slower because I don’t want to drive the oil prices in the world up,” President Trump tells reporters.

2963 2018-11-05 18:54:26 @ZBCNewsonline now the runaway train that is ZBC main news have a guest suggesting that Invictus is a genuine & competent firm that will generate oil but also mid 2020 is when the TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR exploration well will be established! WTF!Nyika yati tasa kumawere takatarisa!
2964 2018-11-05 18:54:21 Again, one guy getting slashed on occasion is not the same as a team getting pushed around. I know Flames fans find it hard to believe but little Johnny isn't the only skilled player in the league that gets hacked and whacked at.
2965 2018-11-05 18:54:20 Don’t worry. The GOP will find a way to steal that too. This dude is 100% snake oil.
2966 2018-11-05 18:54:18 It steals our oil, gas, whisky, food, electricity, taxes etc etc etc
2967 2018-11-05 18:53:47 Lol my car needs an oil change, the engine light just came on, I’m on E, my passenger tires need to be replaced ASAP, my cats need more food and litter, my phone bill is due in a day and I have like 0 dollars 
2968 2018-11-05 18:53:32 For an amazing simple meal, toast some panko with olive oil, garlic, and anchovies, and then toss it over some pasta.
2969 2018-11-05 18:53:17 Heat are immensely frustrating because with Spo and company they have a staff that can refine oil into fuel. They just need some damn oil. The Dolphins don’t have oil and don’t have good refiners. Sad!!
2970 2018-11-05 18:53:14 If anything I buy more full sugar drinks because I can’t stand the taste of sweetener! As for the truffle oil... can you really afford to scrimp!?
2971 2018-11-05 18:53:12 @CNN the UNILATERAL sanctions placed on Iran will hurt the dollar and make us weak. The EU, China, and Russia will create a SVP and the dollar will be useless for those oil transactions. The sanctions are just WINDOW DRESSINGS for his base.
2972 2018-11-05 18:52:56 Not everyone, just people who show them on the internet. 
Besides, I'm sure we could do something with your nails. There's nothing a nail oil, good cut and a pretty nail polish can't do

2975 2018-11-05 18:52:37 Hard to find silver lining for #Iran in the reimposition of secondary #sanctions & addition of hundreds of entities to the SDN list, so why some are exuberant over 8 countries getting Iran oil waivers as opposed to say, 6 or 7, is baffling.
2976 2018-11-05 18:52:33 I am not big on shouting about politics here on Twitter & I mostly keep to talking about design, but as Washington state goes to vote I want to encourage my fellow WA voters to join me in saying yes to #1631initiative. Don’t let the ads funded by the gas & oil industry fool you.
2977 2018-11-05 18:52:33 She even ripped my fam off from the grave! He CROOK of a hubby cut us ALL outa her will, excepting a small used cars worth of cash 4 my disabled sis. Even when the oil boom resurrected, I got a call from Corsicana RE royalties, till they learned of the divorce. Thanks, mom-NOT!

2980 2018-11-05 18:52:13 The I-1631 propaganda campaign is the funniest shit. Billion dollar oil companies throwing millions into ads where the key message is “don’t make us charge you more money uwu” - like that is proof in itself that they won’t be able to mitigate the loss by raising prices lol
2981 2018-11-05 18:52:11 Baba, this one no be lie, sometimes a oil show of kindness to them and the next thing they are thinking its "you and me" forever, the thing is you can't stop being kind becos its who you are
2982 2018-11-05 18:52:05 Liverpool's ,Man United and Arsenal's success were built on their self built success not oil rich dictators of middle East

2989 2018-11-05 18:51:35 These blow-outs will ease. There is more rail loading capacity to be exploited, if needed, and if diffs persist, it will be employed. Right now producers are trucking oil all over SK/AB/ND searching for arbs. Higher RR's+more CBR+more PADD3 exports = improved diffs. everywhere.
2990 2018-11-05 18:51:34 Well it’s low fat anyway. My sauce had red wine redcurrant jelly and balsamic so not too bad. The chips were good though. Make as chips for frying. Parboil for 5. Shake. Spread on baking tray spray with oil and cook. Season with salt.
2991 2018-11-05 18:51:31 Poor Candice  all the comments about CBD oil make me think maybe I should give that a go to help my pains too x
2992 2018-11-05 18:51:28 Does it need more oil?
2993 2018-11-05 18:51:21 Nangai oil is great for it.

2996 2018-11-05 18:51:14 Me too! It won't change my drinking habits, just slightly reduce the number in my bank account. Maybe I'll just switch to waitrose own brand Truffle oil to balance it out?
2997 2018-11-05 18:51:12 
2998 2018-11-05 18:51:03 Asked about restoring sanctions on Iran, Pres said he didn't want to cut all of Iran's oil sales worldwide because he doesn't want to drive up world oil prices. Says it'll be a gradual end to Iran oil sales and insists, the US sanctions "are very tough"
2999 2018-11-05 18:50:44 Making himself comfortable in the new clothes he grins and looks to make sure he has everything needed to ‘catch’ a werewolf. Chains, oil and mock silver knife are all set. “I’m good, I’ll close my eyes and wait a few minutes for you to hide.”

3002 2018-11-05 18:50:34 Total Bullshit. We're funding oil wars for private interests. 

All is forgiven if John Bolton is the first soldier to step into Iran

3007 2018-11-05 18:50:07 I mean excluding most of the OIL Sanctions on Iran would be like having sanctions on Nebraska while EXCLUDING CORN?? #askcvpayne

Freaking castor oil? 
Sooo, soooo, grossed out.
3010 2018-11-05 18:49:56 Couldn't disagree more. That entire play was due to Matheson being embarrassed by the kid seconds earlier & not being thrilled about. Also, the fact Pettersson weighs 160-pounds wet made it worse than it was and I was on the suspend him train from the moment the play happened.
3011 2018-11-05 18:49:54 I wish they would put funny green slime into movies more often

3013 2018-11-05 18:49:39 @HealthyDogClub if I give you my link for cbd oil may you give me a shout out
3014 2018-11-05 18:49:37 What they don't understand is that sanctions will cripple them, cut them off from the worls, and likely lead to the downfall of their brutal regime. Oil does not provide much nourishment.
3015 2018-11-05 18:49:36 Can’t you just drop some oil in a humidifier and call it a diffuser ???
3016 2018-11-05 18:49:33 So Charles, ever wonder what the point of Trump reducing regulations on the oil/gas industries to ostensibly increase jobs was...if he intended to MANUALLY KILL the very commodity they exist on? If oil crashes those jobs WILL BE LOST?? #ASKCVPayne
3017 2018-11-05 18:49:29 please me more oil if you can
3018 2018-11-05 18:49:27 entao os EUA como maior vendedor de armas, (com empresas privadas) tem incentivo a fomentar conflitos e guerras entre regioes do mundo.      Ex: A Ford, Standard Oil (ESSO), bancos e Dupont, todas participaram dos 2 lados da 2 guerra mundial.

3020 2018-11-05 18:49:23 Oh I don’t know about that. Your oil portraits are tremendous. Besides I’ve luckily had the aid of many fine art directors. They hide a multitude of crimes. :)
3021 2018-11-05 18:49:11 Does Jamaican black castor oil actually work?
3022 2018-11-05 18:49:08 Not advocating for more oil or whatever here. I'm just saying that we are naive to think that scientists can't be bought out or put to silence. It is reported that grants are cut/ refused to climatologists if they refuse to get to get into the warming/CO2 causal trend.

3025 2018-11-05 18:48:59 Join me 19/21/22G @AJEnglish. Defiance from #Iran as #US imposes sanctions on oil and financial sectors @Baysontheroad +@virtualzein reporting. Plus #SriLanka and #USmidterms.
3026 2018-11-05 18:48:52 Honestly i think the dr that did my csection was amazing because I never had a big scar to begin with! And then I used bio oil for a couple months and my stretch marks lightened immediately!
3027 2018-11-05 18:48:50 Got tires + oil @FirestoneTires at @FirestoneAuto ;24hrs; Messed  tire pressure gauges; didn't really change oil; didn't tell me; Had 2 techs fail to fix it and THEN Had the receptionist be rude and defensive.Will have to waste another day for them to fix? #CustomerService #fail

3030 2018-11-05 18:48:26 I drive by Lucas Oil Stadium downtown Indy everyday on my way into work. I always say out loud to myself, “One day...WrestleMania will be in that building!” I’ll never stop believing! @WWE @VinceMcMahon @TripleH @StephMcMahon @VisitIndy @IndSportsCorp #BringWrestleManiaBackToIndy
3031 2018-11-05 18:48:08 What about the wife tho? She should be boiled in oil!
3032 2018-11-05 18:48:06 @SkyNews I work in the oil and gas sector "It's not that bad a place to work" - give over, the last few years have been horrific with redundancies, there have been 160k related job losses since 2015.  But our industry just gets bad press.
3033 2018-11-05 18:48:02 Hey, here’s a thought, maybe if Team America: World Police and the rest of the arms loving West stopped bombing the shit out of every oil rich country in the Middle East, people wouldn’t want to leave 

Simplistic I know...
3034 2018-11-05 18:47:57 She's not but more importantly she belongs to the elitist limousine socialist crowd, worth 245 million,  that is insulated from the effects of the policies they pontificate over at cocktail parties. They know better than you do what's best for you.
3035 2018-11-05 18:47:43 .@realDonaldTrump Why is gas $4.50 in California? Aren't you supposed to be getting along with the Saudis? Oh, yeah, you all are playing with the price of oil as a payback to them. We can support ourselves you know. We have enough oil.
3036 2018-11-05 18:47:36 I saw that live - my does he know how to throw it back in their faces.
3037 2018-11-05 18:47:06 demi retired 
Bravo and Mangala still play for city. Both have had long term Injurys, Mangala went on loan to Everton when we signed Laporte. 

Hope this helps and the scary oil money doesn't keep you up at night.

3039 2018-11-05 18:47:00 Only thing about having a nice car is keeping up with the maintenance. $100 for a damn oil change! this shit need to come with a full tank of gas.

3040 2018-11-05 18:46:37 @SkyNews Oil and gas is seen by smart young people as a doomed sunset industry.
3041 2018-11-05 18:46:36 @Busisa74 Mr Moyo Last week at the meeting with HE it was stated the edible oil manufactures get 20m in forex a month. Is that true? If so, who gets what? In terms of units what does it equate to?

3045 2018-11-05 18:46:12 Who created the cabal @OfficialPDPNig? You did, you allocate all the oil wells and the lifting and importing back to the country. You are crying now because the knife has Ben taken off your hands for cutting and sharing the national cake. Family of wailers...
3046 2018-11-05 18:46:09 Its a shame when we do find OIL and or gas it will be looted by the so called LEADERS like they did in marange
3047 2018-11-05 18:46:02 all she needs is tea tree oil.
3048 2018-11-05 18:46:02 Totally agree silent fireworks is the only way forward. Get some OCD oil for the animals it will help
3049 2018-11-05 18:45:55 Trump is a billionaire. He has always had his hands in Petro. Like all the rest. Petro is and always has been the biggest WORLD market.
Russia is a big exporter of oil. 
Thing you don't get is China a bigger threat. Russia is broke and Trump braking them more w/natural gas

3052 2018-11-05 18:45:36 Anyone who thinks skilled players on every team don't get slashed and hacked, is kidding yourself. With due respect to Calgary radio, they are thinking back to a different time and that is not what today's game is.
3053 2018-11-05 18:45:32 But Mr.Moyo..I'm curious if cooking oil comes from SA it doesn't mean it will be cheap...increased supply ..will price drop?...
3054 2018-11-05 18:45:27 Na rain oil petrol/gas stations have to be one of the worst and most disorganized stations I have seen in nigeria. They need to understudy northwest petrol stations. #amess!!!!

3056 2018-11-05 18:45:10 “It would cause a shock to the market,” if we went to zero right away, Trump says, speaking about reimposing sanctions on Iran today
“I don’t want to lift the oil prices world wide by clamping down 100 percent,” Trump says, adding it will be “gradual”

3057 2018-11-05 18:45:07 Nigeria is not serious;
1. Africa's largest oil reserves - but no seriousness about investing in Petroleum Engineering/Geology research.
2. Mobile Revolution - no govt research funding for Telecom Engineering.
3. Power Sector - no govt investment in Power Systems Engineering
3058 2018-11-05 18:45:01 Oil industry? #RFID is being used to automatically identify assets out in the field, in lay down yards, on rigs, & wherever there's oil.
3059 2018-11-05 18:44:59 Oil doesn't bring in so much anymore. And the economy was built to depend on oil and abandoned other significant revenues.
3060 2018-11-05 18:44:59 So who Funded the Sardar Patel statue in India?public sector companies that paid for it out of their CSR funds Indian Oil Corporation-900 cr,ONGC-500 cr,Bharat Petroleum -250cr,Oil India Corporation-250 cr,Gas Authority of India Limited - 250 Cr and many other Govt Companies only

3072 2018-11-05 18:43:38 Let's see shall we? What discount are you offering on a company about to be pumping out huge amounts of oil? Just remind us all. We have listened to your pump for long enough and today's price shows you what your investors really believe. You guys Han dish it out but not take it!
3073 2018-11-05 18:43:38 a farce made up of "socialism" in words, but the defense of capitalism in deeds—and not just any capitalism, but a rentier economy totally dependent on oil.
3074 2018-11-05 18:43:34 Their only assest is Oil lol
3075 2018-11-05 18:43:10 I will have to look up this THIEVES OIL!!  TY for the info!
3076 2018-11-05 18:43:07 Covered in school as well. Death chants are practiced. The Educators are funded from Saudi oil for food program. There is an entry fee though, one ticket submitted for jumping, murder dismemberment drawing
3077 2018-11-05 18:43:04 WaPo is so corrupt that it will not last "eternally".  Saudi oil is only marginally important to US.
3078 2018-11-05 18:43:04 If you use light olive oil instead of extra virgin olive oil, it's not bitter.
3079 2018-11-05 18:43:01 Heavy carbs, limited oil is the way to go.

3085 2018-11-05 18:42:21 Dear Anon,
I’ll be finishing my NYSC in December, I would love to work in an oil and gas firm or an investment bank or be part of the big 5.
Thank you.

3088 2018-11-05 18:42:14 We have to know better than always blaming the oil people... Because they adapt where they can make money!  As the canadian government did by using tax dollar money to buy a billion-ish pipeline project while carbon taxing it's people, it's actually just about money.
3089 2018-11-05 18:42:08 I mean excluding most of the OIL Sanctions on Iran would be like having sanctions on Nebraska while EXCLUDING CORN??
3090 2018-11-05 18:42:03 i believe in common sense when it comes to food and nutrition,,,,,for instance,,,,avocado has alot of fat,,,,but common sense always told me that it was not the kind of fat that is bad for you,,,,same with olive oil,,,,and the natural sugars in fresh fruit are not a problem
3091 2018-11-05 18:42:01 Where can you purchase cannabis oil in Illinois and will it show up in a drug test if you're going for a job. I'm in a lot of pain and I think cannabis could be of assistance but I'm afraid to try it.

3094 2018-11-05 18:41:48 Deficits are up.
Farm exports are down.
Gas is WAY up.
There are 0 new steel mills.

Ask your wallet if you’re doing better now.   If you work in West Texas, the. Good for you, you have a job in oil.

The rest of us?  What boom?  Believe a #LyinTrump or your own eyes
3095 2018-11-05 18:41:40 Exactly,everyone is desperate to make money, he knows how desperate he needs the job that's why he is using it against him. Nigga works in an oil company, I heard we rise by lifting others.This man is suffering, the little he could do as human is to reduce the amount he collects
3096 2018-11-05 18:41:36 I feel like rubbing baby oil on that thang

3099 2018-11-05 18:41:13 How many trillions of dollars have been added to our wealth since Trump became President? We now have the best economy in the world. In August we became the greatest oil producer in the world surpassing Evil Russia and Saudi Arabia! Stop lying to your followers.
3100 2018-11-05 18:41:11 These are the same Saudi's that perpetrated the greatest act of terrorism on American soil , manipulated the oil market that created chaos in the shale industry 3 yrs. ago but Trump places the Saudis above our  allies ?? Why because they spend money at Trump Hotels #Emoluaments
3101 2018-11-05 18:41:07 John Harwood Clown Alert on CNBC now !!  @cnbc  Quick turn your channel before you turn to stone.  Clown !!  Biased !!  Joke !!  Pathetic !!

3103 2018-11-05 18:40:54  i think i heard that somewhere...
3104 2018-11-05 18:40:54 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
3105 2018-11-05 18:40:51 Imagine how high your costs will be by constantly having to run your heater or air conditioner when all the toxic chemicals Big Oil expel into the environment impact the climate. I’d rather corporations pay their share instead of me.
3106 2018-11-05 18:40:49 Thank you but we weren’t interested in the oil. It was a men’s special product. Is there a BARAKA outlet in Maldives?

3116 2018-11-05 18:39:54 Hard to know what is true.  Turkey is run by radicals, have reason to lie.  SArabia was modernizing, but could be lip service/propaganda, as they want to raise money for their oil company's IPO.  I simply don't trust mid-easterners, which is sad.
3117 2018-11-05 18:39:48 Coconut oil baths obsessed
3118 2018-11-05 18:39:38 Well at least we can move on from the idea of the big oil, auto and media conspiracy, as it's now just tens of shorts who don't stand a chance anyway. I don't expect to see anymore complaints of FUD.
3119 2018-11-05 18:39:31 Wouldnt it be great if @PolisForCO stance on prop 112 was YES. Instead he'd rather side with oil and gas to line his own pockets with $$$

3130 2018-11-05 18:38:00 Many people think that the increase in the price of oil means an increase in the price of gas. This is not the case with heating and cooling systems. The price of natural gas has actually been falling, while heating oil prices have risen.
3131 2018-11-05 18:38:00 Once we don’t have to fund billionaire fortunes made in the private insurance con game, yes it’s cheaper!

A few Republican messes need to be cleaned up, and dental added. If we quit subsidizing Big Oil and Wal Mart that’ll easily pay for it.

3136 2018-11-05 18:37:41 Increased our coal exports by 60 percent; U.S. oil production recently reached all-time high.
United States is a net natural gas exporter for the first time since 1957.
Withdrew the United States from the job-killing Paris Climate Accord.

3138 2018-11-05 18:37:24 ...and they are allowed to import oil from Iran. on the other hand those neighboring nations like Yeman, Turkey and Syria are severely affected by the nuclear policy, usage of ballistic missiles and usage of other chemical and biological weapons of Iranian regime.

3147 2018-11-05 18:36:23 So hey Mike, who's decision was it to give India a six-month exemption on the Iranian oil sanctions? India is currently evading sanctioning under CAATSA for purchasing Russian S-400s. India screws America. Then you do them a favor with the  six-month exemption?

3149 2018-11-05 18:36:12 Turkey has the fastest growing economy int he middle east unless you count libya, which is trying to build itself up after the collapse of ghaddafi.

3152 2018-11-05 18:35:59 So Charles, ever wonder what the point of Trump reducing regulations on the oil/gas industries to ostensibly increase jobs was...if he intended to MANUALLY KILL the very commodity they exist on? If oil crashes those jobs WILL BE LOST??
3153 2018-11-05 18:35:53 We created an attention economy thinking it would be like the oil economy - wealth flows towards oil havers, we are all collectively attention providers, woohoo!

3156 2018-11-05 18:35:49 Re: knife handles. If you don’t wash them in the dishwasher (!), the oil from your hands is sufficient in my experience
3157 2018-11-05 18:35:47 Awww you look nice & snug hope the lavender oil is working sweetie

3160 2018-11-05 18:35:41 To celebrate a productive work day I've gone and spilled half a pint of extra virgin olive oil on my tights.

Plus side: I now can scratch my leg and moisturize my hands in one efficient move.
3161 2018-11-05 18:35:36 Big Oil does a terrific job currently in enabling billions of people to thrive in a natural hostile climate. Any alteration in minimising production poses a real threat to the global population. #WinterIsComing
3162 2018-11-05 18:35:35 $cj.t a decent quarter, pays a divy and oversold as it gets for these guys. Bounce is underway with #oil back up and #naturalgas taking off 
3163 2018-11-05 18:35:35 Sex is inseparable from the person and to reduce a person to SEX is as silly as to reduce water to oil
3164 2018-11-05 18:35:23 A strong oil and gas industry is the exact right time to start diversifying. The funds from oil and gas can accelerate diversification so Alberta can weather commodity highs and lows better. 
The lack of oil and gas profits in #Alberta is a whole other topic.
3165 2018-11-05 18:35:11 even the gods would reject this, there’s no palm oil.
3166 2018-11-05 18:35:09 You don't have to look very far. The Flames get worked over pretty good. Gaudreau slashes! I live in Calgary and local sports radio is always talking about that. Mind you I don't watch those games so can't confirm.
3167 2018-11-05 18:35:02 Just reading... "Any Venezuelan with marketable skills (and oil engineers
are definitely marketable) has by now fled to Colombia, Brazil, or further
afield." #Venezuela. #Comunism ruins countries and life.

3169 2018-11-05 18:34:51 A Peppermint Oil Message Would Be Great
3170 2018-11-05 18:34:46 I will be 50 years old telling mechanics “my dad said. . .”
They ain’t getting me. I shut the hustle down before it starts.

I always go to him first with any concerns. Only thing I get without my dad’s consultation is an oil change and air in my tires.

3179 2018-11-05 18:33:58 Saturday nighte: a stubborn zit! Dab it with tea tree oil and it'll be gone in no time.
3180 2018-11-05 18:33:37 Certainly for Franklin, but in the war it was about saving oil and other resources by having people sleep while it's dark and be awake while it's light. Similar resource arguments have been made more recently.
3181 2018-11-05 18:33:32 Some nail and hand treatments combine paraffin wax and aromatherapy. As the paraffin is warmed, a few drops of an aromatic essential oil are added, diffusing the scent into the air and adding a subtle fragrance to your skin once the cooled wax is removed.
3182 2018-11-05 18:33:23 This is wrong because US oil takes a lot longer to refine. It will take months if not years to catch up to demand with shale.

3185 2018-11-05 18:33:12 Literally everyone is telling me to use tea tree oil or vitamin e oil. Ima go buy some and soak it more in sea salt water.
3186 2018-11-05 18:33:09 All men do is watch Rick n Morty, sell oil cartridges, and lie to their girlfriends.
3187 2018-11-05 18:33:07 Is it related to al dente syndrome, where you ship an oil painting before it's fully cured?
3188 2018-11-05 18:32:57 I hear you. That reasoning seems very tribalistic and part of the problem tho...we can see what happens when the richest oil or mining organizations use this tactic. I think people should do what they think is truly righteous for themselves.
3189 2018-11-05 18:32:45 You guys are gonna get sick because of that oil
3190 2018-11-05 18:32:34 They need our oil to keep their triple AAA rating,  they can print money.  But they would end up paying for it.  So they want to use Scotlands resources to pay their bills.
3191 2018-11-05 18:32:32 Went to bed early for a change.  Got up early.  Made breakfast.  Got my oil changed.  And I’m an hour early for work.  Is this adulting??
3192 2018-11-05 18:32:19 ..stage. And in case of following the instructions by the US regarding sanctions many of the country face the cosequences by negating the the instructions of not to import oil from Iran. And in that case Japan , china, North Korea and India have been waved out from the sanctions.

3222 2018-11-05 18:30:13 I know it seems like that now but remember everyone said the exact same thing during the industrial revolution, and during the oil revolution, and during the computer revolution.  People will just change jobs as they always have....

3248 2018-11-05 18:27:02 Scotland does not need oil as we have other resources that are as it happens  in short supply in rUK. Ponder that.
3249 2018-11-05 18:26:56 Also his Dad was in the army and now works in the oil fields, and his mom used to work in a diner to help make ends meet, but now she has cancer. And some relatives won't talk to them because of differing politics. Folks, the song writes itself.

3258 2018-11-05 18:26:16 I remember when people were burnt during taking oil from an upside down tanker, this burn center was non functional. People were forced to move Lahore and some of them died during transfer.
3259 2018-11-05 18:26:14 So what will those currently benefiting from oil and those expecting to benefit from it do to this your campaign?  @obyezeks but there is truly no need for only I WANT TO, when u can start with examples now.
3260 2018-11-05 18:26:12 The exemptions are for Iran's biggest customers --data goes back a bit--- Iran exports 22% of its oil to China, 14% to Japan, 13% to India, 10% to South Korea, 7% to Italy, 7% to Turkey, 6% to Spain and the remainder to France, Greece (& other European countries)

3267 2018-11-05 18:25:47 Rt. And oil reserves sold to a long-time associate of #Ramaphosa himself. The same person who sold the mine 2the Guptas. As far as I am concerned, it was a swop or a payoff.

3278 2018-11-05 18:24:19 Just limiting to one per buyer encourages a carousel, retailers would then spend a great deal of time handling small invoices of 1 x 2L cooking oil. I think there’s method in the madness

3286 2018-11-05 18:23:50 If your hands are feeling terribly dry as the weather gets colder, a quick fix besides lotioning up every hour is  coconut oil and sugar. Exfoliating and moisturizing!

3298 2018-11-05 18:22:00 A sprat to catch a mackerel,and tonight to my surprise the sardines in the lovely herby oil are sprats. Eaten on toast with a New Zealand Sauvignon. And cat and dog joined in. Chasing the tin around the floor or elegantly licking a paw.
3299 2018-11-05 18:21:49 If people who oppose Prop 112 are so worried about the U.S. depending on foreign oil, why do we export 1.6 million barrels of domestic oil to other countries?
3300 2018-11-05 18:21:47 You are so terrible on fpl @Asnahfff  no wonder you are not making noice anymore..! Bcz you are down beneath the league table looking for crude oil

3302 2018-11-05 18:21:39 @PHO3N1X_T1 @Abyss9394  kraig might be a bit out of it tonight. I gave him cannabis oil for his anxiety and insomnia
3303 2018-11-05 18:21:15 I was going to say something about nationalizing the oil companies, but I realize that’s a true ‘pony.’ But a carbon tax certainly can get us on the right track.
3304 2018-11-05 18:21:14 What find is Fashola talking about?
You got $322b Abacha loot and shared it yet went to borrow $328b from China for ICT. May I remind him that we are in oil boom, about $100per barrel as against a benchmark of $46 per barrel.
3305 2018-11-05 18:21:04 I need my oil changed
3306 2018-11-05 18:20:54 Help I can’t stop getting high before bed and ordering stupid shit off Amazon  why the fuck a lava lamp AND an oil diffuser just show up at my doorstep

3308 2018-11-05 18:20:46 In oil and gas, an SEC defined “Proven Well” has a 90% chance of success.  It’s amazing but one out of ten times those “Proven” wells are dry holes.
3309 2018-11-05 18:20:35 So it’s official… Should be lots of oil on the market for the next six months! And oil has an uptick today? How long will it last? I see a drop coming unless some cuts in the future from OPEC
3310 2018-11-05 18:20:32 Ma’am the check engine light doesn’t always come on when the oil needs to be changed. You loud, wrong and arguing with someone whose job it is to know this
3311 2018-11-05 18:20:29 B.C. doesn't want Alberta's dirty oil. If you're gonna ship it( by royal decree with military back-up: oilstate is fascist, refine it there 1st so it isn't so dirty. Oil lobby won't crying off until every last barrel is sold+life on earth is extinct.

3317 2018-11-05 18:19:50 Without doubt, it's high time we look to Angola for Oil supply. These prices are getting outta hand..
3318 2018-11-05 18:19:45 The price of brent crude oil went down during the month of October. The Rand was trading 14.75 against USD in October and is currently at 14.18. Based on what they always tell us as the reasons behind price hike we were supposed to get a decrease. #PetrolPrice
3319 2018-11-05 18:19:32 We actually get very little oil from them anymore.  Their biggest customers are other countries and that's what OPEC's little price experiment was about last year. Where to price oil to keep American producers out of the equation and maintain us as an importing country.
3320 2018-11-05 18:19:28 A clinical study of 12,000 people was published in the New England Journal in 2013. It showed that one gram of fish oil daily does not reduce mortality from heart attacks and strokes. $AMRN wants to prove another and drive up share cost.#vascepa #fishoil #offlabel #Drugtests #ah

3326 2018-11-05 18:18:49 THIS IS RIDICULOUS WHY IS AMERICANS OIL PRICES SO HIGH POTUS YOU MADE CAMPAIGN PROMISES FOR LOWER FUEL PRICES STAND BY YOUR WORD I KNOW YOU ARE A MAN OF HIS WORD
3327 2018-11-05 18:18:46 What is wrong with bundling? Why have retailers decided on bundling? Is it just boost of sales or they want to curb cooking oil traffic through their doors, which is getting in the way of regular shoppers?

3333 2018-11-05 18:18:13 Similar story for me, but it was trying to make donuts from Pillsbury biscuits in an over-filled skillet of hot oil on the stove.  Gouts of flame shot up and I really came close to burning down my apartment building.
3334 2018-11-05 18:18:10 This is your random reminder that CBD oil suppresses cortisol secretion and orgasms lower your cortisol level.

3335 2018-11-05 18:17:45 should do the same with Maduro and stop importing Venezuelan oil,
3336 2018-11-05 18:17:44 Sales are growing despite the large number of tests showing that fish oil has no positive effect. It happens because  there are companies as Amarin. $AMRN is not interested in health, only money profit. #Vascepa #Fabricated @US_FDA #ScientificFraud #medfraud #AHA18 #fishoil

3340 2018-11-05 18:17:35 completely agree. 2020 won't be felt in 1q19 though in tanker rates yet as fundamentals to allow for that won't have changed yet. key is whether oil futures go to contango from backwardation. Brent has 9 cents/bbl difference in January-May contracts which is bearish signal IMHO

3354 2018-11-05 18:16:29 remember a few years ago under Obama when we approached "TANK TOP" where we would literally have 0 storage space in the US for any oil we're pumping out of the ground? They were putting 10's of thousands of railroad tanker cars on railroad sidings to store them, etc
3355 2018-11-05 18:16:27 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...

3358 2018-11-05 18:16:22 No, what they had in Venezuela was actual socialism, with the state controlling the commanding heights of the economy and deliberately stripping the state oil company of resources for social support. The mistake was compounded by the perils of the Petroleum Curse.

or hold 28 for a more gradual bounce and a stronger bottom(maybe another test of the low)

A 3pack of tuna(sunflower oil) is £2.99 but a single tin is 70p.
Aren't multi-packs usually meant to be more value??
3375 2018-11-05 18:15:15 It would have been awful. For one, no more oil coming out of western ND. No pipelines. No economy anywhere. Nothing but  dark and gloomy everything.

3378 2018-11-05 18:14:55 Dawkins “snake oil” is the proven truth. There is no scientific conspiracy against religion. When you gain enough information and perspective on virtually any subject you realize that god has nothing to do with it.

3386 2018-11-05 18:14:16 Writing a thing on this, but what the oil and gas industry is doing in Washington around I-1631 and in Colorado around Prop 112 and Amendment 74 is scary as hell and should kill any notion that they'll come to the table in good faith on climate policy.

3390 2018-11-05 18:14:00 Went to get an oil change and found out there’s a nail in my tire and not patchable. And then the guy comes back out and tells me he’ll give me a brand new tire for free!
3391 2018-11-05 18:14:00 The Afghan war is basically a result of our not thinking through our response to 9/11 and therefore is not about oil in an immediate sense, but the primary reason our empire became entangled in the Middle East is oil.

3426 2018-11-05 18:10:04 China, india, japan , Turkey and South Korea will be given U.S. 'permmission' to buy Iranian oil.
When did China ever ask for permission ?
The total arrogance of the most deceitful country on this planet is now becoming hilarious.
The U.S. Actually believe people respect them !!!

Equities mixed, though tech and Asia weighed; moderate gains in oil on Iranian sanctions; AUD edged lower ahead of #RBA; GBP gained on #Brexit talk; #NZD firming in mid-0.6600's; US elections coming into focus.
3429 2018-11-05 18:09:55 I actually have everything to try but sodium itself for initial drying, which I was going to get by means of thermochemistry (yet one more sub-project I was working on trying to find "calmer" components).
Previously I tried with t-Amyl and molten-dried to oil NaOH for no success.
3430 2018-11-05 18:09:53 Because the real reasons must be hidden for them to appear legitimate

-Keeping Iran/Russia/Syria out of oil markets; in order to maintain US petrodollar standard
-favor to Saudi Arabia (Iran’s enemy)
-favor to Israel (Iran is preventing the Israeli’s from invading Golan Heights)
3431 2018-11-05 18:09:45 I knocked a bottle of oil over on my shelf not realizing it until I started to smell it and it dripped into the tank... killed them all

3433 2018-11-05 18:09:30 The Iran deal reversed - they hate us & they sponsor terrorist, The EPA reversed - jobs for coal & oil back, open borders are now protected borders, loves America no apology tours & loves Americans shown - off welfare & back to work, stock market has been up  more to come watch
3434 2018-11-05 18:09:19 I think it's mistaken decision, Trump is supporting Saudi secret fund ISIS and al-Qaeda against Syria, Iran and other. because Trump is ignoring about Saudi who kill journal. Trump loves oil and money from Saudi Arabia.
3435 2018-11-05 18:08:58 My car battery died .. I probably just failed a test , I need an oil change , I’m about to finish my Netflix series.. my phone is cracked . And I have 4 dollars to my name Bc I bought shoes. Can life get annnny worse for me

3437 2018-11-05 18:08:40 1.@SecPompeo: More than 20 importing nations have zeroed out their imports of crude oil already, taking more than 1 million barrels of crude per day off the market.The regime today, since May, has lost over $2.5 billion in oil revenue
3438 2018-11-05 18:08:39 "Items included a line of $1,400 'swampy-fairy-dresses,' soaps made from recycled doughnut-frying oil ($85 to $195) and a felt scuba suit ($3,500), which Ms. Puett conceded was more 'psychological' than commercial."

3441 2018-11-05 18:08:31 How to Make Thieves Oil and Why You Should Be Using it Daily
3442 2018-11-05 18:08:21 Obama is very good at eloquently & emotionally talking about a ‘brighter tomorrow’. However he really has no clue how to get there. Why would things get better under the Democrats Barack? What policies? Delivered when? Reminds me of a snake oil salesman I once met 
3443 2018-11-05 18:08:20 getting burned by hot oil definitely was the highlight of my day 
3444 2018-11-05 18:08:14 Yes, i have the ability to make more because i grew a nice crop last year . .  each year i grow enough to turn into organic oil
3445 2018-11-05 18:08:13 I think the way would be fuel cells, perhaps even hydrogen byproduct from fusion power plants but big oil lobbyist have slowed that research way down.

3447 2018-11-05 18:07:46 Ammunition, gun oil, targets.
3448 2018-11-05 18:07:37 I noticed we started that trend towards getting us back on sound economic ground started under @BarackObama.  The TARP was passed by Bush to keep us back from the financial cliff that the GOP put us on.  GOP tax cuts while at war put us there.  Also, Iraq was a play for oil.
3449 2018-11-05 18:07:31 I thought they were baby oil teabags

3453 2018-11-05 18:07:17 I use tinctures, a salve, a lemonade drink and vape oil. Most often vape. I do believe in antibiotic properties. I have the worlds worst immune system, and since using CBD more often from a reputable and licensed dispenser, I’ve had less colds for sure.

I hope they'll feel the same when a bomb takes out the KFC on South Eads St. because there was a soldier in there. Won't be so 'small price' then, will it?

3464 2018-11-05 18:06:28 President Carter was a peanut farmer who installed solar panels on the White House roof in the 70s...Reagan then won and ripped them all down in the 80s (cause Americans use oil)...and then Reagan went out of his way to contradict science for business interests!
3465 2018-11-05 18:06:19 You need anointing oil poured on your head

3476 2018-11-05 18:05:01 The fact that it is the oil executives and conservative think tanks paid by said executives that are pushing out these anti-climate change "studies" says it all, really.
3477 2018-11-05 18:04:56 You should be sick in your head to think that this deal will benefit the poor and downtrodden.
Only the top echelons will have the lion's share of the oil proceeds.
3478 2018-11-05 18:04:51 Weed oil? :o
3479 2018-11-05 18:04:51 No thanks -Scott has been an election-year Johnny Come Lately to many issues of the utmost importance to the state. During his 2010 campaign he was disturbingly open to oil drilling off Florida’s shores. His stance didn’t change even after the Deepwater Horizon oil-spill disaster
3480 2018-11-05 18:04:48 اوكي بس. كيف اللي فكرت فيها
3481 2018-11-05 18:04:48 Weed but if you don’t have that, excedrin. Also orange oil or past tense blend

3486 2018-11-05 18:04:27 To all millenials who feel middle aged at 27 or 37 - get some sleep, cut out the sugar and processed food, eat some high quality fat like butter and coconut oil, you can’t binge drink anymore, and TAKE CARE OF YOURSELVES.

3511 2018-11-05 18:01:44 Yes, you use less energy, but the point remains that for the long-foreseeable future, the creation and delivery of EVs (and food) requires a fossil-fuelled production and supply chain. You use less oil, but you still rely on oil, and will for a long time.
3512 2018-11-05 18:01:33 basically just spraying truffle oil on croutons and eating them without any salad because stress
3513 2018-11-05 18:01:28 I have just tried to buy a packet of crackers. 1000 varieties ALL have palm oil. Didn't get those then. We can make fuel out of oil from the chippy & we eat a lot of fish & chips & it's vegetable.
3514 2018-11-05 18:01:26 Yes I did just call my dad 4 times to ask questions about my car while filling out a scheduling form for an oil change what about it?
3515 2018-11-05 18:01:25 What will happen when there is no longer any demand for oil?
3516 2018-11-05 18:01:21 Using my lunch break to get an oil change 
3517 2018-11-05 18:01:16 We did not hire ourselves, USA needed people well educated lot, that is law set forth by US Congress. If you need oil you dont buy oil from India that got no oil, you buy it Saudi or Iran that got oil. India got what US needs, other countries dont , it as simple as that.
3518 2018-11-05 18:01:12 Where does the oil $$ go? Is there an accounting?
3519 2018-11-05 18:01:08 I adore you Laura, and I'm so grateful for you (and your olive oil).
3520 2018-11-05 18:01:02 "Washington has pledged to eventually halt all purchases of crude oil  from Iran globally but for now it said eight countries - China, India,  South Korea, Japan, Italy, Greece, Taiwan and Turkey - can continue  imports without penalty."

So basically they're not really in place.
3521 2018-11-05 18:00:52 #Saudi_Arabia has pledged to supply the oil market with all its needs.

2.5 M barrels aren’t an issue, #OPEC can compensate for Iran's share.
3522 2018-11-05 18:00:52 Have you, or the president, or senate started making concrete plans for the future? If you are having trouble paying minimum wages now what will happen when western countries stop buying your oil? Western countries are on schedule to ban importation of vehicles using fossil fuel.

3531 2018-11-05 17:59:46 Yup... I think oil stocks showed there hand. Higher rates and lower oil prices. Oil stocks go boom
3532 2018-11-05 17:59:43 
3533 2018-11-05 17:59:16 No Sir, he's right! Someone shld pay 4 Trump's tax & billions of US  funding Israel! No pretext better than DT & his cohorts narrative on Iran, encouraging Saudis buying arms, raising oil revenue & shedding blood 4 them!
3534 2018-11-05 17:59:11 Thank goodness that Earl Ray Tomblin enticed those companies to invest in the oil and gas fields in WV. Without them being here we would of went nowhere. Question why is wind power taxed as salvage? Can anyone answer that question.
3535 2018-11-05 17:59:07 Still waiting for the media talk about how these lower oil $'s are going to stunt FID's...waiting...waiting...waiting. 
MM's never seem to talk about how low oil $'s are depressive to LT supply, but they sure do like to talk about high $'s being depressive to ST growth.
Huh...

3540 2018-11-05 17:58:38 Can’t get any car service w/out them finding something else. 

I’m droppin’ $800 on tires, an alignment & an oil change. They called saying, “you’re gonna need rear brakes soon. It’s $300 if you want to get it done now.”

Idc if it was $50. I’m not spending any more money today.

Beto sent money 2 these type of men
3542 2018-11-05 17:58:08 It's not the stealing of the oil. Oil theft has reduced. It's the payment of subsidies on petrol by NNPC (under-recovery) that is slashing govt revenues. They'd keep borrowing.
3543 2018-11-05 17:57:58 I’m gonna stop wearing shoes because with that £80 I could be investing in crude oil
3544 2018-11-05 17:57:56 So the complete EU market can get Iranian Oil via Italy and Greece. Very good. Strong sanctions Mr. President.
3545 2018-11-05 17:57:52 The hardship facing the people of Venezuela is the direct result of Trump imposing tougher economic sanctions an oil rich country. 

So miss me with that, "This is why socialism doesn't work, look at Venezuela", bullshit. 

Greedy right wing capitalism is to blame for this.

3550 2018-11-05 17:56:43 Soy also is not really an "end consumer" product. It is an ingredient in other products, is turned into delicious soybean oil, becomes crayons for my kids to colour with, is livestock feed, or has a multitude of other uses. Not much soy grown around here due to our climate. 4/

3558 2018-11-05 17:55:42 Exemptions for 8 countries to buy oil from Iran including India and China is essentially to save the demise of petro- dollars. If there were no exemptions the countries would have used local currencies and that would have been the beginning of the end of dollars.

3573 2018-11-05 17:53:59 @wikipediabrown there’s an episode of Cloak & Dagger where they’re trapped on an oil rig in someone’s mind and they have to stop the rig exploding and they’re being attacked by zombies.
How’s that grab you as a selling point for the show?

3584 2018-11-05 17:52:31 Am I the only one who backed up BP in the oil spill. Those fish deserved to die
3585 2018-11-05 17:52:26 He definitely went out his hair is shiny wet from the oil he uses & he changed & has his old man boots on... uh, so that was him who flushed the damn toilet & probably heard me all depressed & weird this whole time... aaaaah

3590 2018-11-05 17:52:02 Coconut oil is your saviour , trust me
3591 2018-11-05 17:52:02 My apologies. I hadn't realized poor Dawkins was barely scraping bythough I did not state a figure for Harris. Point is, they are both rather wealthy men, selling snake oil to suckers. Just. Like. Osteen.
3592 2018-11-05 17:51:55 It’s either bonfire night or America’s discovered we have oil 
3593 2018-11-05 17:51:44 Has anyone had experience of a Sandyford oil cooker/boiler? They look nice but it is very difficult to find out anyone with one to find out if they do the job. I was looking at the Cottage model

3599 2018-11-05 17:51:20 Ok heading out. Need to get my oil changed and then going to goto this new BBQ place in town
3600 2018-11-05 17:51:19 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
3601 2018-11-05 17:51:19 Michaela is in the bank and I’m sitting in her STEAMING car that smells like burnt oil hoping I don’t explode 
3602 2018-11-05 17:51:19 but seriously ( gods! one of the most over used phrases in comed)  My brother really did try to make kale chips.. grew the cape in our veg garden. toasted them with olive oil in oven. BLECH
3603 2018-11-05 17:51:17 I think this is true as had a Utd fan at work, asked what's the difference between there owners are ours, with the answer being there Arabs with oil money.
3604 2018-11-05 17:51:16 And btw, that’s cut taxes on big oil, big business, and his wealthy buddies. Not on me and you!!
3605 2018-11-05 17:51:07 Finally getting my oil changed 
3606 2018-11-05 17:51:06 Well, not too many consumers want to cook with raw canola seed. We sell it to the elevator, who sells it to the company that turns it into cooking oil or biodiesel. I use canola oil exclusively in my kitchen to cook with.

3607 2018-11-05 17:50:58 Pushing Iran against the wall is risky as more than 1/2 world would do business w/Iran thru black market frm oil cash, isolating US as Russian satellite states will prosper by grabbing plum Iranian cash deals. It's likely incentivise Iranian hardliners to pursue WMD on fast track
3608 2018-11-05 17:50:52 Very few really pay attention. Tax cuts from Trump promised relief, just for the rich. Tariffs promised prosperity, trade defective continues to grow and price increases passed to the middle and lower income class. Iranian oil sanctions, expect higher pump prices. #richgetricher
3609 2018-11-05 17:50:40 D_Lebatard looks like a guy that would be wearing a speedo at the beach asking chics to put oil on his belly.
3610 2018-11-05 17:50:29 Probably the cannabis oil/bath!
3611 2018-11-05 17:50:13 Embarrassing distraction from the real #RussiaGate.

3612 2018-11-05 17:50:06 I agree. Places that are not cleared for other uses are perfect for wind or solar farms. Oil fields, strip Mine sites, landfills, toxic dump sites, all could be used.

3614 2018-11-05 17:49:55 Some thing but put it on pasta. 
Use left over pasta, sautéd in garlic olive oil and butter. Then toss with those same buttery sautéed breadcrumbs.
3615 2018-11-05 17:49:46 Wouldn't they wait to act out against society until they'd already bought the weapons needed? Also, relying purely on competition to ensure quality doesn't work. Look at the oil barons of the gilded age. They crushed the competitors and without restrictions that'd happen again
3616 2018-11-05 17:49:46 Dear @ncitayim  , regarding to an agreement Iraq and Iran have begun swapping crude oil that due to it Crude from the Kirkuk field in northern Iraq is being shipped by truck to Iran as swap. 

What will happen for it?
3617 2018-11-05 17:49:42 Ah the good oul days when the ever helpful british army checked your engine oil and filled up your wiper bottle

3620 2018-11-05 17:49:31 Pradhan credits US waiver on Iran oil imports to #PMModi #GlobalLeader 
India is a major importer of Iranian oil — of the 220.4 million metric tonnes of crude imported by India in 2017-18, more than 9% was from Iran
3621 2018-11-05 17:49:29 Oil of oregano is super clutch for bug bites
3622 2018-11-05 17:49:26 very good point! I'm unfortunately stuck with storage heaters. They HA won't install central heating in my area because it would be oil not gas.
3623 2018-11-05 17:49:25 They control the oil even when they have none,  now they go for gas and none comes from their region. We need a country different from these hawks.
3624 2018-11-05 17:49:23 The stew oil is plenty

3629 2018-11-05 17:48:55 I put MCT oil in my coffee this morning but please don’t take that as a sign I have my shit together
3630 2018-11-05 17:48:45 Vaping still has it's health problems.
Pop lung from inhaling vapourised oil & copd.
But current analysis is it's far less harmful than ciggs.

Burning fossil fuels is the new smoking.

3632 2018-11-05 17:48:35 Maybe the 'politics' is just like Iraq, where ISIS sold stolen oil to Turkey and Turkey sold it to the US. You really think the US won't continue to buy Iranian oil? Oh, you didn't know that was happening already? You disappoint me. I thought you were at least a little informed.
3633 2018-11-05 17:48:22 I know this is a little off-brand for my tweets, but does anyone know of a good coconut oil that is used for hair?
3634 2018-11-05 17:48:21 Lol you're supposed to use coconut oil, they hate it
3635 2018-11-05 17:48:19 So your point is that #babanrigamobilebanking is cheaper and better for us?
3636 2018-11-05 17:48:14 Basically trump wants Iranians to have oil for breakfast.
3637 2018-11-05 17:48:10 You put tea tree oil on your whole face or just pimples?
3638 2018-11-05 17:47:59 Oh dear.

So no £350m/week to NHS then.

<tsk> Ah well, good job I got this snake oil to cure all and take us to the sunny uplands!
3639 2018-11-05 17:47:58 would like to thank @EileenSpencer for introducing me to peppermint and coconut oil as a headache/back ache relief remedy, it truly works wonders
3640 2018-11-05 17:47:57 ahhh it wasn’t mine i think it was Yangyang’s from oil :))
3641 2018-11-05 17:47:54 IMO it doesn't pay to be simplistic about things: life is complicated. For example, foreign aid for girls' health & education reduces birthrates. Lithium, etc. are recyclable in the long term. Bunker oil isn't & is seriously polluting, so should be used only til we can do better.
3642 2018-11-05 17:47:46 "You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time." Lincoln. Six more months of Trumponomics, the economy will be bleak regardless of who controls Congress. Tariffs, inflation, trade, oil, stocks.
3643 2018-11-05 17:47:39 well much of it is related to passthrough (to consumers) of oil price. but also much of it is related to the output capacity of an economy like making a less powerful engine go faster will overheat it. one way to control inflation is to increase the output capacity of econmy
3644 2018-11-05 17:47:27 That day will nit be far off. Jute clothes are already in market.  Better than wearing nylon/synthetic clothes made out of crude oil waste!!
3645 2018-11-05 17:47:21 日系企業だと税務コンプライアンスなのかやってくれないんだけど、外資系企業なら会社が損しない節税対策は非常に協力的。
額面の給料を50万減らして、減らして50万相当の社宅を無償貸与。会社から見てコストは変わらないが、個人の所得税は所得が年間600万減るので大幅減。

3647 2018-11-05 17:47:13 Modi’s New India is treated differently:

India continues to buy oil Iran:

India buys S-400 system from Russia despite US pressure:

India carried out surgical strikes:

India completes successful establishment of nuclear triad:

No international opposition or sanctions

3657 2018-11-05 17:46:26 Ma mi auguro che sia così. Certo che le maggiori testate che si occupano di oil&gas sono preoccupate. Poi staremo a vedere. Ovvio che in questo momento delicato di equilibrio, (situazione Siriana, Libica e Arabia Saudita) era meglio avere garantito l'approvvigionamento dall'Iran.

3660 2018-11-05 17:46:02 It's going to subsidising fuel and cooking oil unfortunately. We never said we wants that subsidy, let individuals source own forex. We not benefiting from it anyway.

3662 2018-11-05 17:45:55 Wholesale gas prices still descending despite choppy crude oil market. Election Day 2018 will see a few sub-$2 gal US gas prices and about 1500 sites at less than $2.25 gal. Still early innings for the decline.

3669 2018-11-05 17:44:50 Price of crude oil is still under $70 a barrel, we have debts to service, salaries to be paid, infrastructures and roads to be built, repaired and cost of maintenance including  other commitments at home and abroad. In between you have massive corruption.

Cases and screen protectors are snake oil and only there to make you feel better even though they don’t do shit. Now I only use a case cause of those magnetic things for my car to use google maps on road trips
3673 2018-11-05 17:44:43 I wont wade into attacks on @ProfJNMoyo, he is more than capable of speaking for himself but I suggest that you wait for the finalisation of the process. Once oil/gas is discovered an announcement will be made. This is not being negative but taking issues for what they are

3681 2018-11-05 17:43:32 Also don’t use coconut oil on your hair. It clogs your hair follicles and can’t stunt hair growth. It also just sits on top of the hair and doesn’t actually penetrate your hair and just builds up. Build up = breakage. If using any oil use one that is much lighter!

Remember if when they setup the oil pump to withdraw oil for the future
By designing & managing the oilwell as the oceans garbage is dumped, at stages of sands can be placed over or storms have pushed sands in liquid to break down
3687 2018-11-05 17:43:04 i used rosehip oil on my face only once and it’s already sooooo soft
3688 2018-11-05 17:43:03 Oil prices recovered some ground after five days of heavy losses as the United States imposed a range of punitive sanctions on Iran, aiming to curb exports by the Islamic Republic, including its sales of fuel.
3689 2018-11-05 17:43:03 How long was it before this was made public? And, like the Iranian oil sanction thing, what are the odds this kind of news is announced over the midterm weekend? Are we going to get any comment on this from the #WeBelieveSurvivors movement?
3690 2018-11-05 17:43:02 Hahahahahaha oil chafuu
3691 2018-11-05 17:42:59 Fail of the day: was making hash browns for breakfast this morning, then the oil popped out of the pan & burnt me on the eyelid 
3692 2018-11-05 17:42:57 Literally just heat some oil on a high heat, add it all in, mash it all up add some onion, sometimes bacon (you can skip obvs), fry an egg or two for on top! DEAD EASY.
3693 2018-11-05 17:42:48 If you impose sanctions on Iran but the oil tanker is sunk, were there ever any sanctions in place?

I don't like dry salad, but sometimes (rarely, i admit, but it happens) I'm not in the mood for something any heavier.
3700 2018-11-05 17:41:38 Nope. Related to oil sands or some such?
3701 2018-11-05 17:41:38 Agreed, there are high times and low times in price of crude oil but the calculation is the average figure within the time span.
3702 2018-11-05 17:41:31 What bs he said on the campaign trail doesn't matter. Because shit like we should have taken iraq oil. And ever since he stepped into office he done nothing to scale any interventions down.
3703 2018-11-05 17:41:28 Some people in France really love their cars and refuse to consider other transportations so I see higher oil prices and gasoline taxes as a potentially good thing
3704 2018-11-05 17:41:18 Oil changes so high . Coulda spent that money on a new pair of Vans.
3705 2018-11-05 17:41:11 I make like palm oil
3706 2018-11-05 17:41:02 this is what drives me mad never saw anybody predicting Leicester winning the prem or global oil prices halving yet they know the construction costs of a stadium they have no idea what it will look like if there is a recession after brexit construction costs will fall
3707 2018-11-05 17:41:02 Gotta get babygirl a oil change asap
3708 2018-11-05 17:40:59 As sanctions are applied to Iran oil sales, the US has allowed South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, Greece, Japan, China, India and Italy a temporary waiver that allows them to continue to import Iranian crude oil
3709 2018-11-05 17:40:57 I seemed to have based it on pop because the discussion veered towards oil dependent states (the tweet I replied ref to 2 oil states with small pops) which have limited revenue, so large pop is a disadvantage. A diversified economy is a diff case. The main issue was affordability

3721 2018-11-05 17:40:03 the day i can go to McDonald's and buy fries and ketchup with bitcoin and not get a weird look from the cashier by using it il jump in for sure!...also snake oil has to be useful for something
3722 2018-11-05 17:39:53 Right. That's what I said. You said oil.
3723 2018-11-05 17:39:48 Additional features are that the Government's pact with Japan on currency swap & negotiation with Iran for payment in Rupees for oil imports. You should appreciate these as well

3736 2018-11-05 17:38:11 I told the meineke front desk lady that I was leaving my car here and coming back, she said “wait” and left to the garage and came back with my filters and said “these are supposed to be white, do you want us to replace it for 60 dollars” 

JUST CHANGE MY GODDAMN OIL.

3740 2018-11-05 17:37:37 .@JZarif Resolving the old oil dispute between the Israel & Iran should allow Tehran to buy dollars from the Israel Iran paying in oil, thus the Israel is hosting the EU its mechanism. Iran for such purposes officially dropping Houthi support, Houthis left dealing with CIA...

3742 2018-11-05 17:37:31 And yet millions die now due to oil needs of the World.

Afghanistan is once again producing heroin at peak levels which gets transported into Europe under the protection of the US Army.

US fracking is polluting and stealing natural water supplies just like Stalin would have.

India’s Approach ?

Although India is among the 8 countries who got waiver but India must understand that this waiver is temporary.

Iran is crucial oil trade partner to India and any shock can force it to land in Energy Crisis.

Just saying.
3757 2018-11-05 17:35:51 It's not about oil or gas my point was prices have gone up...the cost of living has gone up...there might be higher wages but that only means something if the cost of living decreases at the same time.
3758 2018-11-05 17:35:41 I agree. It is a huge problem, most food that is mass produced in is unhealthy and full of contaminants and in many cases, plastics. The oil and gas industry has gotten away with murder figuratively.

3761 2018-11-05 17:35:33 Sounds like snake oil, to me. I just checked out what HHDL might have to say, and twitter thought I might want to follow Obama, B. Gates, or Deepak Chopra. 
3762 2018-11-05 17:35:33 Iran lost around $2 billion in oil revenues since May, U.S. official says: Iran has lost around $2 billion in oil revenue since May, when U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal, U.S. Special Representative for Iran, Brian Hook, told reporters on a call on…
3763 2018-11-05 17:35:28 Insurance? More like snake oil.
3764 2018-11-05 17:35:28 They have got excellent oil potential. Shame they are being strangled by the sanctions, isn’t it?
3765 2018-11-05 17:35:28 goodmorning! lets get this yeast, warm water, sugar, salt, canola oil and all-purpose flour
3766 2018-11-05 17:35:25 Sure, Iran will sell their oil through third party, like Turkey, that has experience buying oil from ISIS.
3767 2018-11-05 17:35:23 
3768 2018-11-05 17:35:18 LOL ...they can use waivers as an excuse to cut back on production, now that that oil is not leaving the market for 6 months
3769 2018-11-05 17:35:16 Sorry bro, this is neither food, not green.
Styrofoam and lights? One made out of oil, one produced by burning coal?
You wanna farm, go plant a farm. Not this #FrankensteiFood.
3770 2018-11-05 17:35:13 crypto shit sounds like snake oil to me but I guess Im just too old for the current year.
3771 2018-11-05 17:35:06 mmmmmmmm.  BTW, got my venison back. Fried up some burger in olive oil, added a little seasoning salt, and had it with fried potato slices. Died and gone to heaven.
3772 2018-11-05 17:35:04 You have one of the biggest timber industries in the world. Do the math on that for me please. Did I mention open pit mining, shale oil fields, and unsustainable    not to mention barbaric commercial fishing.
3773 2018-11-05 17:35:00 You’re probably better off with a full spectrum CBD supplement that’s in MCT oil. Unless you can guarantee what the ingredients of the pen are. Sometimes there’s crap filler in the pens depending on the supplier.
3774 2018-11-05 17:34:50 If I could be covered in rose essential oil 24/7 that would be SUPER dope...I feel like I’m running through meadows rn
3775 2018-11-05 17:34:43 they basically ate olive oil and sadness before the 16th century brought the tomatoes, i ain't scared of 'em

3777 2018-11-05 17:34:35 I've learned that co2 oil burns more even and doesn't boat
3778 2018-11-05 17:34:33 Always good to see more Louisiana oil/gas projects.
Though I have all the work I can do now, growing the industry is a

Thanks @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump for supporting the energy industry.

3783 2018-11-05 17:34:01 Chavez ruined the economy. They’ve got huge potential oil wealth, but now, as a result of government policy, everyone is trying to leave.

3798 2018-11-05 17:32:16 Of course they would, their competitors can't afford it so it enables them to dominate the oil sands. It still screws the average Albertan with no gain to the environment.

3817 2018-11-05 17:30:09 I understand the importance of oil but we should focus on renewable energy to power up some big plants/factories. Can you do something like that with some of your factories, it will be great example for others.
3818 2018-11-05 17:29:44 What stops the EU from just giving money to Italy to buy oil for them?
3819 2018-11-05 17:29:39 Well,let's see. First the earth cooled. And then the dinosaurs came,but they got too big and fat, so they all died and they turned into oil.

3824 2018-11-05 17:28:51 Lol they're actually nice to me, especially on Fridays or during engineering rally.
How they know my name still remains a mystery.
3825 2018-11-05 17:28:36 don't oil the toilet seat, got it
3826 2018-11-05 17:28:28 Iran sanctions were put on officially this morning, oil market is barely up and stock market largely doesn't care.  With what @TankerTrackers has put out recently, this is the correct reaction
3827 2018-11-05 17:28:26 I don't need much and I hate to beg, but life's been rough, I just need gas and an oil change
3828 2018-11-05 17:28:21 It was Goya oil she rubbed oo
3829 2018-11-05 17:28:05 Poor Vladimir - he wants so desperately to be the big, bad kahuna in the world, but the only big thing the little 5’7” thug has is his ego!  He’s king of a second rate country with a one trick pony economy - oil!  His act is getting old!
3830 2018-11-05 17:28:00 Continued attacks on the Oil and Gas industry in the name of a fraudulent "Global Warming" power grab, potentially devastating no only to those directly involved, but the economy in general, not to mention those of use who happen to USE and LIVE BY cheap energy EVERY FRIGGIN' DAY
3831 2018-11-05 17:27:58 All you have to look at the cost of a barrel of oil from 2016 until now...it has risen plain and simple at the end of 2016 it was $50 per barrel today it is almost $64...higher oil means higher gas prices...
3832 2018-11-05 17:27:56 It's so sad to build your career on lies and deception, on starving innocent children! On protecting oil Lords who chop up their own people.
3833 2018-11-05 17:27:55 Got to kick out the oil companies first!
3834 2018-11-05 17:27:36 I’m sorry Mr Marr but your interview with that snake oil salesman was a shocker. Adonis is spot on here
3835 2018-11-05 17:27:22 I'm waiting for an oil change and the phone of this older woman next to me has been blowing up more than mine.
3836 2018-11-05 17:27:20 Aussie and coconut oil 
3837 2018-11-05 17:27:12 Big money does own the media. That’s not a statement of hatred; it’s truth. I’ve done the actual public records research . Have you? You all sound like morons when you say things like this. Interlocking boards of directors with oil and bank people on them.
3838 2018-11-05 17:27:05 I prefer the approach of the Alberta oil sands companies: adopt carbon pricing early, give oneself a long runway to adapt and innovate, then enjoy a competitive advantage in global markets pricing carbon because your competitors have tarried.
3839 2018-11-05 17:26:58 Ya podrán quejarse a gusto cuando vengan de visita Maduro y Evo...
3840 2018-11-05 17:26:40 I have asked this question over and over and get no answer..Where are these jobs? Private sector? Hospitality? Industry? Warehouse? Retail? Not retail..lol. Factory? Coal? Oil? WHERE?
3841 2018-11-05 17:26:39 How are they going to spend their oil money now? 
3842 2018-11-05 17:26:39 Coconut oil is so good for your hair. It makes it soft and shiny. I’m impressed. I’m gonna use it for my skin cuz it’s too oily but definitely for my lips. It makes your lips soft too and it has a great smell.
3843 2018-11-05 17:26:35 Tag Oil  has access to a capitive Agri market and int't sales terminal. The easier time it has getting its product to the market the more profit for the companies and shareholders. Tag is well position to benefit from China/NZ Ag business growth and UK/NZ Ag dairy business demand
3844 2018-11-05 17:26:32 Pulled up for a simple oil change. End up spending 100 dollars. 
3845 2018-11-05 17:26:31 Try looking at a map of the North Sea of where all the developed and undeveloped Oil fields are. Hint: they aren't within Shetland's international waters...
3846 2018-11-05 17:26:23 Fort Knox doesn’t hold gold it holds OIL
3847 2018-11-05 17:26:20 Oil gives a f***! woozer
3848 2018-11-05 17:26:18 Trying to change my oil and just that. I dont care what the fluid look like , how low the coolant is none of that . So save that speech
3849 2018-11-05 17:26:14 How can you say he blew it before you have the results? He has made Texas the state we all believe it is. Compassionate and not in the pocket of big oil. I love seeing Texans out at his rallies and has changed the perception of the state. Hopefully tomorrow they will vote Beto!
3850 2018-11-05 17:25:58 Actually Encana's downfall is due to Randy Eresman decision to split off their oil properties off to Cenovus.
3851 2018-11-05 17:25:53 Gonna be interesting SS.  Some nice, pedestrian opportunity today in the oil patch (kinda like these relaxed trading days)....resting up for the potential fireworks :-)
3852 2018-11-05 17:25:50 That's awesome!! I'd been waiting on this post :) We just re-rdered our cod liver fish oil after randomly forgetting about it for multiple months 
3853 2018-11-05 17:25:48 I would worry if Bulawayo consumed our entire capacity of 4,500mt this would be a pint 330ml of oil every two days based on 1m people
3854 2018-11-05 17:25:46 I have room for one medium sized canvas painting (oil or acrylic) and 5 9x12 drawings/illustrations (graphite, prisma markers, colored pencil, acrylic, or mixed media) dm me!! i’m trying to get out of town for a day or two I need dis
3855 2018-11-05 17:25:38 No water? Ever? Cum taste like battery oil ah wha datttt
3856 2018-11-05 17:25:29 Cuando le digan algo empezará el hashtag #conlasesposasNO
3857 2018-11-05 17:25:23 I think perhaps its more than a $64,000 question and my sense is that its for oil they are currently importing but there are expected percentage decreases. Don't know how much yet.
3858 2018-11-05 17:25:21 Dad is changing the oil in my car and i’m just praying he doesn’t see the empty bootlegger bottles in the back seat
3859 2018-11-05 17:25:19 Honestly to be safe we must not expect too much out of this oil thing and save ourselves the disappointment of high expectations when actual results of the exploration come.
3860 2018-11-05 17:25:18 Big oil should remove all their gas pumps from Broward County. Lead by example and have them banned from the county.

3864 2018-11-05 17:25:04 The US administration aim for "zero" seems to squarely apply to details about the waivers on Iranian #oil. So far missing is the quantity waived, the duration, whether the waiver applies to crude oil or condensate, or both, and what % cut is needed for any further waivers. #OOTT
3865 2018-11-05 17:24:55 if it’s super dry try sleeping w coconut oil in at night. don’t put it near your roots tho bc then it might be too oily

3869 2018-11-05 17:24:43 Exactly right. The tree huggers would have you believe that oil companies flare gas as a means of shorting the market. When in fact it is more of a safety and production issue.

3880 2018-11-05 17:24:09 Not sure what state you live in but up nearly 40 cents per gallon since 2016 not to mention oil per barrel has risen anywhere from $15 to $20 per barrel
3881 2018-11-05 17:24:06 During the period of Diwali festival many people travel to home and then return back. This increases carbon footprint, pollution and wastage of precious oil. So stupid comedians of India will ban Diwali pan india

3886 2018-11-05 17:23:40 exactly all bluster and show, while keeping the oil & cash flowing.
The truth is all the posturing about Iran is mainly for amping up our domestic politics.  They need a bad guy to blame for worlds ills. 
Sadly most of world looks at USA as the bad guy today.
3887 2018-11-05 17:23:34 My alarm didn’t go off, started work at 6:30 woke up at 6:25, rushed outside and fucking fell in front of a bunch of neighbors because I slipped on oil in the driveway. Not my morning at all

3903 2018-11-05 17:22:46 Maybe you can comment on the $64k question...how much oil do the sanctions waivers amount to  #OOTT
3904 2018-11-05 17:22:40 - Organic shampoo is better
- Avoid hot showers
- Don't brush your hair
- Avoid sulfates and silicones
- Use satin pillowcase
- Wash with cold water
- Use oil to prevent split ends
- Trim your ends
- Let it air dry
3905 2018-11-05 17:22:34 Forgot to put on deodorant so I just rolled my peppermint oil aromatherapy under my arms. My becoming a hippie is solidified now, plus I smell like a candy cane. Happy Mariah Carey season.

3907 2018-11-05 17:22:28 Oil flat. Expect it to remain pinned down here - in the low  60's - for at least a couple more weeks.
3908 2018-11-05 17:22:21 TAG Oil produces sweet, light oil. 

Light oil gets a higher percentage of the hydrocarbons converted to things such as gasoline, making it worth more, and preferable to heavier oil.

Reason #1 to invest in Tag. receives Brent Oil pricing
3909 2018-11-05 17:22:20 No wonder his people are starving, the oil money goes to Trump and to PR, marketing him.

3918 2018-11-05 17:21:23 The US is giving us permission to buy oil from Iran? And we celebrate Independence Day!
3919 2018-11-05 17:21:13 They’ll still use oil just not near as much

3922 2018-11-05 17:20:52 In question the move to go full speed ahead. I’ve kind of taken the strategy of forcing other like Saudi Arabia to burn through their oil, and conserve ours based on prices continuing to be low. Just my take.

3925 2018-11-05 17:20:35 She’s not necessarily far from wrong. I wouldn’t suggest smoking it but you could get it in the form of cannabis oil, which might certainly help

3948 2018-11-05 17:18:28 This is all Kabuki. Quietly because of how poorly the #Iranian policy was thought out, #Trump was forced in order not to have a revolt against the $ as the official trade currency gave waivers to 8 major buyers of Iranian oil such as #China & #India. So much for sanctions
3949 2018-11-05 17:18:23 They sent contracts and all o,I was so happy.
I signed and mailed back.
No oil,No pasta,Nothing.
3950 2018-11-05 17:18:21 Do oil changes usually cost $50 or am I being scammed ? Lol serious question
3951 2018-11-05 17:18:01 Are oil diffusers good for a large living room? Like does the smell travel well?
3952 2018-11-05 17:17:54 @Forty_Hall Shocked to see the polluted pond outside the hall today.  Not a sign of life on the pond which seemed to be covered in an oil slick.  Is anything being done about this?
3953 2018-11-05 17:17:51 €1700 to look like an oil spill on a wet road!!?
3954 2018-11-05 17:17:43 Or they will likely bury their heads in the sand and pretend nowt is happening, ring up Tony Blair to see if he's got any more snake oil to sell.

3962 2018-11-05 17:16:36 I'm not allowed to take nsaids because of my bleeding disorder just recently tried cbd oil and I swear it's a life saver
3963 2018-11-05 17:16:33 Gshit if you want something stronger buy oil it’s sad  people just want to cover the pain
3964 2018-11-05 17:16:29 Mom waking us up so early. Oil heated with turmeric and black pepper. New dress. Visit to other older relatives. Idli n sambar. Laddu n mixture. Crackers and endless crackers. Visit temple in evening. Deepavali and mom are not there today.

3966 2018-11-05 17:16:05 How many households are there in Bulawayo and surrounding areas? Of the past week, how many people had weddings, parties, funerals and other functions that required c/oil? What of boarding schools? Good you trying, though you cannot match the demand. Market confidence dololo!
3967 2018-11-05 17:15:37 What's a great way to produce healthy Mediterranean food?

3968 2018-11-05 17:15:28 Avocado oil is high in monounsaturated fats which is good for #testosterone production & #Fatloss - It increase healthy HDL cholesterol, it’s high in the antioxidant lutein, it enhances the absorption of nutrients, a far better alternative to vegetable oils to add to salads etc.

You are definitely not one of the 200 million mumus
3970 2018-11-05 17:15:09 and the trick for any economy in the world is to stop trading in dollars. IDK how US is gonna react to it but I think even the oil should be traded in other currencies.
3971 2018-11-05 17:15:08 Ok the oil/gas swap deal is still on...how about electricity and food supply to Iraq?
3972 2018-11-05 17:15:01 that whale oil was used in transmission fluid in automobiles until the late 1970s.
3973 2018-11-05 17:14:50 I remember that week back in ‘89 living in Dallas. Jerry Came off like the slick willy snake oil salesman he is. Opened his mouth & inserted foot several times. He was the most hated man in the state of Texas after he did Landry like he did. Classless billionaire clown

3977 2018-11-05 17:14:32 Go on eBay search Lindens hempseed oil they’ve got an offer on also
3978 2018-11-05 17:14:28 Had it been me in much worse state, they would have sent me to school w/ a rag, eucalyptus oil, & non drowsy cough syrup w/ a note attached.
3979 2018-11-05 17:14:21 We will not make significant change unless we stop all oil sands production. It’s killing our environment. We need a carbon tariff on goods from high polluting countries like China and India but we have inept leadership in charge of this portfolio
3980 2018-11-05 17:14:20 Newsflash:  Joe Terranova's IQ now being questioned at the 90 level.  Please Joe, don't talk. It only gets worse.

3995 2018-11-05 17:12:11 FWIW, Trump supporters can't be considered Republicans by any of the typical standards; maybe y'all should come up with a new party.
(I do agree that we shouldn't have gone to war for oil though)
3996 2018-11-05 17:12:09 David, most of our revenue depends on crude oil, during the PDP 16years administration. prices of oil were high thus giving us a lot of money but now prices are real down. If we are lucky and prices go up we need to invest in technology, infrastructure, education, tourism etc.

4001 2018-11-05 17:11:43 I agree entirely, especially living in good old oil & gas Alberta. I'm very much hoping that we can take advantage of the longer growing seasons here in the south of the province and start making biofuels and plastics from hemp to kick out the fossil fuel industry.

4014 2018-11-05 17:10:33 Oil Price is now about $70 per barrel... nothing to blame again for their very ineffectiveness and inefficiency

4018 2018-11-05 17:10:14 Some use tallow for the fries and then sunflower/mixed veg seed oil for their other foods. At Place Flaget, for example, they say the other oil is ‘cheaper and healthier’.
4019 2018-11-05 17:10:12 goodyear just tried to make me pay $80 to get my oil changed and my mom yelled at them & is making them redo it ohhhmygod lol
4020 2018-11-05 17:10:12 Did you know that a great way to clean your glasses is by using dish soap? Dish soap's grease-eliminating properties cuts right through the oil and gunk deposits on your glasses thus leaving them squeaky clean.
4021 2018-11-05 17:10:10 How many countries have been given waivers to buy Iranian oil?
4022 2018-11-05 17:10:08 Try evening primrose oil or Angus Castus, can get them both from Holland & Barrett. Take them every day and you will notice the pains will ease each month 
4023 2018-11-05 17:10:06 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said 8 countries will be  exempt from #Iran oil sanctions.

4041 2018-11-05 17:08:31 I was at the Torbay location a few weeks ago. Did you guys change to a different oil?  The cod bites and fries weren’t their normal colour and taste. We weren’t impressed, haven’t been back, hoping it was a one time thing.

4081 2018-11-05 17:03:52 @JerryDragoo my class loved your PBS video on skunks!! We would love to ask you 4 questions!  Fingers crossed you will respond! Thank you!!!!
Why do male skunks eat their kits?
What's your favorite skunk name?
Why are skunks black & white?
How fast can skunks rebuild their oil?

4089 2018-11-05 17:02:46 Italy/Greece have always had warmer ties with Russia/Iran than most other EU countries, but I agree that they probably won't go as far as creating state-run companies to buy Iranian oil

4092 2018-11-05 17:02:20 Iraq wouldn't be taking Iranian oil for power. It burns its own oil for power generation, as well as Iranian gas. It also imports Iranian electricity.

4101 2018-11-05 17:01:20 Parce que le peak oil est une donnée physique et géologique, passé en 2006. Ne pas avoir anticiper ne nous exonére pas de la transition. Avec Macron elle est subie. Avec l’#aec elle est choisie.

4103 2018-11-05 17:01:09 I've just read yet another half-page newspaper article in the business section about the oil industry. More whining about how they're not making enough profit because of a glut today but need to invest in more capacity in future.

4115 2018-11-05 17:00:32 I’ve been taking herb kingdom cbd oil mate def gives you good recovery
4116 2018-11-05 17:00:31 THC oil is a deravitive of canabus.  There is a lot of information on the Internet and youtube about its effects on cancer cells.  Also, sugar feeds cancer.  A person must eliminate sugar in their diet. God bless!
4117 2018-11-05 17:00:28 yes CBD oil is available in our pharmacies and if we are out of stock your local store can order it in for you.
4118 2018-11-05 17:00:25 I’m so scared to get an oil change by myself
4119 2018-11-05 17:00:23 おーまだ起きてたのかー作業か？無理するなよ？
4120 2018-11-05 17:00:19 They may end up selling a little less oil by volume but the price of oil has been rising so net effect will be ?.

4122 2018-11-05 17:00:12 Naturally. It would interfere with their pipeline plans. So the whole WWF report obviously means nothing to them, they are THAT owned by oil.
4123 2018-11-05 17:00:11 I use the digital readout in my car for speed in the TT, and have no issues with it, but for things like fuel level, rpm, coolant temp, oil pressure and ect I find I much prefer to have the dial...even given the choice as it is in the 240 (I use a customizable digital display)
4124 2018-11-05 17:00:10 Cop some beard oil. Hopefully the beard Gods bless me
4125 2018-11-05 17:00:10 And EU/Italy/Greece are also probaly not creating specific state run companies to buy Iranian oil, which would be a good thing to have IMHO
4126 2018-11-05 16:59:53 These services help people. That you don’t see them as valid does not relegate them to “quackery.” Yes, there are snake oil salesmen among them, but there’s validity to some of these practices. They can offer pain relief, increased mobility, increased range of motion- “quackery?”
4127 2018-11-05 16:59:49 Funny coz oil prices are lower n Rand is doing well against the USD so why not decrease then? This government is just corrupt.
4128 2018-11-05 16:59:45 And you sounded like beevis in my head
4129 2018-11-05 16:59:43 Dropped my car off this morning to get the oil changed and a tire fixed. The guy who drove me home is a lifelong Republican here in AZ. He’s voting straight blue in this election because, he says, “we have to get rid of these crazy people.“ 

I thanked him profusely.
4130 2018-11-05 16:59:35 Hey. Look where I live. My state isn’t known for sending the best and brightest to Congress.
4131 2018-11-05 16:59:35 Two hour wait for an oil change !? And the last time I left my car here they never called me and no one knew where my car was 
4132 2018-11-05 16:59:29 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
4133 2018-11-05 16:59:24 A bug got in my ear while  I was napping and I've since poured oil in it and I can still feel it squirming, it's been an hour, my mom keeps calling every 30 mins to check if it's out but it's not dying, I'm literally crying like a baby right now
4134 2018-11-05 16:59:07 get some olive oil chips too, you might need something salty between
4135 2018-11-05 16:58:54 Nigerians easily forget history.  
Today I see the criminal gangsters @OfficialPDPNig going to take blessings from the godfather and i still remind us what about the gulf oil 12.4 billion dollars?  1988 to 1993 is not such a long time ago for us to forget.
4136 2018-11-05 16:58:42 We are laughing with you
4137 2018-11-05 16:58:41 The history of oil extraction in Venezuela is fascinating. It began when US oil companies bribed the Venezuelan Govt for years, removing oil free of charge! The ordinary Venezuelan in the street benefited not at all! The US should be ashamed.

4144 2018-11-05 16:57:57 BP: We support a carbon tax.
Also BP: Largest funder of advertising against Washington #CarbonTax I-1631.
Oil industry: I-1631 won't reduce carbon emissions.

Question: If this will be such a failure at reducing carbon emissions, then how come the oil industry is so afraid of it?
4145 2018-11-05 16:57:54 Not yet but I will now. I’d like to add cinnamon ginger cardamom and another oil to make chai tea with black tea
4146 2018-11-05 16:57:45 Trump has his rallies/riots instead of press conferences because it's a 1 man shit show.  A carnival barker or snake oil salesman with no retort.  A bunch of worn out Nazi phrases and cult change of hate.
4147 2018-11-05 16:57:44 So, Italy will be the EU gate to Iran, but: what cost? For example, the M5S lost a lot of votes for accomplish some US targets (TAP, Muos, F35) to use as exchange for an Iran oil sanctions six-months-waiver. Is that good for a sovranist governament?

4152 2018-11-05 16:57:24 Not necessarily. Oil changes are due every certain amount of miles and the amount of miles depends on the make and year of car. For example: my car needs an oil change every 10,000 miles and it gives me a reminder once I’ve hit that.

4178 2018-11-05 16:54:58 You mean the companies that would have to buy oil from Iran might not want to go through all of those hardships?
4179 2018-11-05 16:54:50 Already in place since 2012. Challenge is that Iran imports much less from India than the approx $ 10 billion plus worth oil India has been importing annually from Iran so far.

4206 2018-11-05 16:52:18 But they give you exactly what you need (aside from oil & water) and tell you how to do it
4207 2018-11-05 16:52:17 Or is it the only real issue is who controls the oil flowing out of Iraq and Syria and where it ends up, who gets to process, pipes it to a Turkish port or Syrian port all the way to the Ukraine?
4208 2018-11-05 16:52:16 Iraq has plenty of their own oil. It's Iran's gas and electricity (and insofar as sanctions go, the ability to pay for it) that they need.
4209 2018-11-05 16:52:06 Yes but why is India exempted alongwith several other countries? They will continue to buy Iranian oil.

4212 2018-11-05 16:51:55 Oil and our dependency thereon is a major variable in current  geopolitical strategy. Get rid of that variable and it will become harder to justify any kind of military based intervention geared towards securing or controlling the global oil supply. Go solar! Go Electric!
4213 2018-11-05 16:51:51 my political science professor was talking about the florida amendment that grouped oil drilling and vaping together and said “i really don’t give a shit if you pull out your juuls right now, but what the fuck does that have to do with oil?”

i’m with you doug.
4214 2018-11-05 16:51:49 Warm it. The oil flows faster.

4217 2018-11-05 16:51:40 Intelligent deregulation & no special interest gets my vote.  Fix laws & policies an expected time then review. Good jobs and pro business focus is good but must require business to reinvest responsibly. Oil spills prevented, forestry, water, wild life enironments restored.
4218 2018-11-05 16:51:31 I see oil everywhere

4222 2018-11-05 16:51:13 Some sanctions.  Hey Iran, you can’t sell your oil except to everyone you’ve been selling it to previously.
4223 2018-11-05 16:51:10 Easy there- Jo Jo Jo is my congressman.  Ugh
4224 2018-11-05 16:51:03 It is indeed well known that all oil & Gas wells produce NORMS (Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials) ... many people mistakenly assume that because they are 'Naturally Occurring', they are 'Safe!

4228 2018-11-05 16:50:37 US to exempt India, China and Japan from Iran oil sanctions, says US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo: news agency AFP
4229 2018-11-05 16:50:32 The difference is that these sanctions include a big part of Iran's economy like oil,banking,swift,shipping,gold,aluminum,...
Before the actual sanctions start Rial lost its value to 1/3 of what it was before.These sanctions are even harder than Obama's.
4230 2018-11-05 16:50:31 Zackly! Eventually I learned to change the oil in my car to spite them lol. And a local guy had an after school program for woodworking etc & I was 1 of the few girls there. I was too much an athlete to sit to learn knitting. #sayftychat

4258 2018-11-05 16:48:24 A lot of information to parse on the subject. The first thing to leap out at me. Israel supports it, at least in 2005. (Huge question mark over my head currently). And well, OIL. Still parsing....

4276 2018-11-05 16:46:23 The U.N. Security Council has authorized action against illicit oil exports from Libya for another six months and added planning and committing sexual and gender-based violence as reasons for sanctions, despite objections from Russia and China.
4277 2018-11-05 16:46:20 And there is very little electricity generated from oil in the US, pretty much only in Hawaii and Alaska.
4278 2018-11-05 16:46:15 @MikeSchreiner what is the federal government's plan for the carbon tax? Will the federal government tax the oil companies? It sounds like right now that the oil companies will be getting more money.

4325 2018-11-05 16:42:18 Get some coconut oil and let it sit in your hair for like 20min, then hop in the shower and wash it like you normally would. After just towel dry it, add some leave in conditioner only on the mid shaft and lower, and braid it for the night! Hope it helps!!
4326 2018-11-05 16:42:10 Minus oil of course. They are exempt.
4327 2018-11-05 16:42:08 Now check the wealth gap 40 years ago - just as Scotland's North Sea oil came on-stream.  Where do you think all that wealth came from, Jeremy?

4332 2018-11-05 16:41:39 Seems plausible there would be sanctions-busting. But according to the law, the eight govts getting waivers must pay Iran in their local currency into the escrow accounts. So Iran can only use that money to buy food/medicine or other goods in the country where it sold the oil.

4350 2018-11-05 16:39:54 How is Kara Swisher allowed on CNBC after laughing at racist Hilary Clinton reference of "they all look the same".  Swisher showed herself to be every bit as racist by laughing.  Surprised the minorities on set would work with her.  Pompous and racist is no way to go thru life.
4351 2018-11-05 16:39:49 Yuan is the next reserve  currency dollar days are numbered. Just like dollar, gold and oil yuan will be used as reserve asset. If both central banks agree to form a parity in exchange rate we don't need dollars to trade in yuan

4355 2018-11-05 16:39:28 100% sure that Iran has been selling oil under the table.

We CANT forget easily!
4361 2018-11-05 16:38:58 Nigeria earned N207.54bn from crude oil and gas export in the 1st half of this 2018, falling short of FG target of N661.38bn.

If you know how much is stolen in oil you would not want Buhari to stay beyond one day. Our crude is illegally siphoned and sold.

Fiscal crisis looming!

4367 2018-11-05 16:38:30 There's a lot no one seems to talk about when it comes to Saudi Arabia. With the  USA move from an importer of oil to a net exporter the social & political tension in the country will be exposed. High unemployment, lack of water, tensions in the monarch, importer of food etc.
4368 2018-11-05 16:38:27 The 'eight country' thing is about waivers for countries that need time to wean themselves off Iranian oil imports. Iraq is looking to obtain a waiver for other stuff, so wouldn't be grouped into that oil waiver announcement.

4386 2018-11-05 16:36:30 I’m so lucky to have the parents I have. Went home this weekend and my dad changed my oil and brakes on my Jeep and my mom took me to my pitching coach, caught for me and fixed my swing..It’s the little things in life 
4387 2018-11-05 16:36:29 I think if you go check, you'll find it is SCOTLAND'S oil! WM takes 93% of the revenue from it and give us 8% back. Do you think they'd give us a SINGLE PENNY if it wasn't ours??? NO.
4388 2018-11-05 16:36:01 Essential oil pens. You don’t take it into your lungs, just breathe in and out through your nose. And therapy took me a long time to accept. I fought it for years and only two years ago finally found someone that really fit me and understood. 2/???
4389 2018-11-05 16:35:58 How many of my male followers don’t know how to change a tire or do their own oil change?
4390 2018-11-05 16:35:47 I don’t think some people realize how beautiful NJ is. It’s not all Newark and oil refineries!  I loved growing up there
4391 2018-11-05 16:35:46 Maybe it would be a good idea but I realize you are a racist, to quit bombing their homelands for oil and gas so that they have a place to live. That way they would not have to seek refugee status. You are a cruel and mean person who should move to Russia.
4392 2018-11-05 16:35:43 All I do is put on bio oil take migraine meds and read my cooking text book
4393 2018-11-05 16:35:36 Try using castor oil
4394 2018-11-05 16:35:34 Getting my oil changed, and the attendant appears at my window and excitedly asked, "You like REDDIT???"

After my heart restarted, I was confused....then I remembered I have a Snoo on my car.  Lol
4395 2018-11-05 16:35:31 Oh yes you absolutely need to try it because my anxiety can be pretty debilitating and this helped way more than I imagined it would. I would recommended the oil over the food products. It works quicker.
4396 2018-11-05 16:35:27 How much are they charging for the snake oil?
4397 2018-11-05 16:35:19 in order to reduce carbon emissions, i suggest you take a look at what is going on in new brunswick with coal burning and oil refining.  these two sources have been given a free ride, while everyone else has to pay.
4398 2018-11-05 16:34:57 Sis Coconut oil is life!

4400 2018-11-05 16:34:35 Shuttle tankers bring high quality oil at night to sts on mother vessels anchored off of Ras Al-Khaima. Been doing this for years. This just one example of how it moves out.
4401 2018-11-05 16:34:21 Then perhaps we need to look into who’s buying their oil, and have a conversation with them.
4402 2018-11-05 16:34:16 What does an original 1642 Rembrandt oil canvas painting and an American MRI have in common? They both cost at least $2500.

4405 2018-11-05 16:33:57 its so tough that the importers of Iran oil got exemptions//oh come on find a way to lie better than that assholes

4407 2018-11-05 16:33:46 Oil is both dependence and pollution. Coal is only one of them, and is localised.

USA produced more oil than Russia for the first time since 1999!
4409 2018-11-05 16:33:14 exempted on some stuff but not oil
4410 2018-11-05 16:33:11 Oil consumption, currently on the verge of 100m b/d, would increase by 10m b/d by 2040, as natural gas demand rises by 40 per cent and the petrochemicals market grows by 60 per cent over the same period.
4411 2018-11-05 16:33:09 I need a oil change so bad 
4412 2018-11-05 16:33:05 But for this not to be true, Iran just has to receive oil revenue outside the US and use it to fund the things the Trump admin doesn’t like, which is a pretty plausible scenario, no?
4413 2018-11-05 16:33:02 No, you couldn't but I'll add some of the ones you forgot:

The oil crisis
The Great Depression
Prohibition
The American Civil War

I could go on, but those are notable ones you forgot to lie about. We'll enjoy celebrating our Wednesday morning.
4414 2018-11-05 16:32:56 Really good snake oil salesmen can move a crown to chills and tears . . . He learned his craft well from Rev Wright.
4415 2018-11-05 16:32:53 If Trump had not given exemptions to the 8 countries regarding the purchase of Iran oil it would have

1. Significantly raised worldwide oil prices 
2. Significantly hurt the economies of these 8 countries who are highly dependent on Iran oil.
3. Negatively impacted world economy
4416 2018-11-05 16:32:47 Gotta find somebody to do my oil change
4417 2018-11-05 16:32:45 When you have a get together at night in the summer, a tiki torch with citronella lamp oil is a smart thing to be carrying with you to ward off mosquitoes.
4418 2018-11-05 16:32:42 Ok. The Asian gang is not nice. They just pumped oil into someone's mouth and then made him kis their feet. Either that, or they're super into BDSM.

4426 2018-11-05 16:31:55 I laugh all the time when I hear people talk about how we're gonna get off oil. They seem to have no idea that we live in an oil economy.

4428 2018-11-05 16:31:38 Thanks I missed that. So knowing CT wouldn't take it back along with Mueller  stopping GP prior to reaching customs is a very important clue. Not to mention this was apparently a cash deal.

4429 2018-11-05 16:31:38 Excess protein isn't keto friendly. Gotta up the fat intake. Butter, lard, avocado oil. That's what fills you up. Protein is a bad energy source.

...
4432 2018-11-05 16:31:22 Yes, we should all take the word of a man peddling hemp-infused coffee on Twitter, i.e., a 21st century snake oil salesman. You obviously have fine judgement and impeccable research skills.

4435 2018-11-05 16:31:06 Defending Bush? He did not bring democracy to Iraq, he stole their oil, fake war on fake wmds. VP Dick Cheneys company Halliburton made billions having contracts in Iraq to rebuild what they destroyed themselves. I get why you hate Russia...they are Orthodox Christians.

4491 2018-11-05 16:27:17 Le sujet est très complexe. Je pense que il faut prioriser. En premier le climat et le peak oil. Les prix du baril vont augmenter, et nous ne sommes pas résilients.

4492 2018-11-05 16:27:15 West will never use Oil to bully India, else it'll accelerate develpmnt in alt. energy options. Solar/Nuclear/EV.

mas com o que vimos ocorrendo, com o oil e o câmbio, é esperado um BELO resultado

4508 2018-11-05 16:26:00 Although they're trying to play it down, those exemptions are the reason oil prices fell today. If (or when) those exemptions do expire, then you're going to see prices jump.

Don’t pretend like you’re an angel while you’re a pure devil.. imagine that terrorism is coming from KSA while we were attacked MILLIONS of times. Even our holy mosque was boomed hundreds of times
4574 2018-11-05 16:20:47 How did you lose? You don't need an oil change. This person owes you $100
4575 2018-11-05 16:20:38 Keep your hands off my nude oil painting.
4576 2018-11-05 16:20:27 and by something new a @Alberta_UCP will institute massive cuts, put all our eggs in the oil basket and pray to white Jesus (tm) that we get a new oil boom.
4577 2018-11-05 16:20:25 Trudeau would rather use dirty Arab oil than Canadian clean tech oil.
4578 2018-11-05 16:20:17 Rather deliver the oil then games.John could put his money where his mouth is
4579 2018-11-05 16:19:59 Exactly.... For a country that dissipates oil that should be child play mana.
4580 2018-11-05 16:19:57 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.

4584 2018-11-05 16:19:44 After 4 months since the grand am limped home after a timing chain jump it went on a cruise around the city. It ran a little warm and has a minor oil leak, but all in all it was a success. Motor pulls strong. No noises nothing.
4585 2018-11-05 16:19:43 List of countries receiving waiver from US sanctions on Iran oil trade includes China, India, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Greece, Taiwan and Turkey - interesting that two EU countries got waiver, but unclear how companies there could clear Iran-related oil transactions
4586 2018-11-05 16:19:37 "The wells that started in 2014 (the year which saw the greatest number of new producers), are on track to recover on average 150 thousand barrels of oil (and ~0.6 Bcf of natural gas) before hitting a production rate of 30 bo/d." 

Holy Schnikes, those wells suck !
4587 2018-11-05 16:19:27 It's not mercy of US rather impotency as India, China and Japan coming together & India had already declared that he will buy oil from #Iran when we will operate chahbar port, China in trade tussle, Turkey more friendly with Russia,Korea can't b ignored as N.korea under scanner

4601 2018-11-05 16:18:46 Dear producers at CNBC.  Thank you for keeping the clown John Harwood off the screen.  Obviously the outcry over his uber biased opinions and self importance have been heard.  His rumored bad mouthing of management probably didn't help him either.  Thank you again.  @cnbc
4602 2018-11-05 16:18:42 Trudeau would rather use dirty Arab oil than Canadian clean tech oil.
4603 2018-11-05 16:18:38 I have zero cartilage left in my thumbs (in addition to bone spurs, cysts and a piece of bone floating around) which causes constant pain. I use CBD oil during the day and either eat or smoke a little at night. It has been a life changer. Oh and I’m 56.
4604 2018-11-05 16:18:34 They just have to relabel the oil cans & ship them through third party suppliers, problem solved. Keep pumping that oil!
4605 2018-11-05 16:18:31 Isn’t that bearish oil prices since cutting revenues to Iranian govt is less reliant on cutting their export volumes?

4607 2018-11-05 16:18:29 that's right Jake, he and his guard "brothers" killed Neda and hundreds of protesters and called them "heaps of trash" back then, all to keep him in office 4 more years to continue stealing Iran's oil revenues. Estimated $700B were unaccounted for during his time as president.
4608 2018-11-05 16:18:28 Trudeau would rather use dirty Arab oil than Canadian clean tech oil.

4611 2018-11-05 16:18:13 There are still at least 8 countries that are exempt from sanctions & can import oil from Iran. 
China, India, South Korea, Japan, Greece to name a few.
4612 2018-11-05 16:18:13 Why give the CCP oil immunity? Not sanctioning the CCP is to open a back door to Iran, such sanctions have lost meaning.
4613 2018-11-05 16:18:12 I have a Bachelors of Science from TexasA&M in college station in Geology,making me a bit of an expert on oil/gas resource development,as well as its superiority to renewables and methods for extraction that are ABSOLUTELY environmentally safe. But that’s a debat for another time
4614 2018-11-05 16:18:08 Appears to see himself? He sees the Ottoman history to be written. The House of Saud would be nothing if not for their oil, besides they have allied themselves with Israel and the US. The Middle East is on edge, what does Egypt do? Watch the Turk.

4620 2018-11-05 16:17:16 @DoddieWeir5 Afternoon Doddie I saw the one show and wanted to contact you about my canabis experience. I’ve had MND now for over 5 years. I make my own cbd oil and regularly smoke cbd flowers / weed. Personally I feel it’s helping me a lot. Would love to share more with you??
4621 2018-11-05 16:17:09 Who care, the oil price then will be cheaper for Israel as gas going almost free from Egypt to Israel anyway, while Egyptians still cooking on primitive trail with deadwood pists beside walkways in mine fields. "Arabs: I'am your leader! You love me or I kill you!" Hey: Bastardo!

4629 2018-11-05 16:16:27 This makes total sense. Consider that The USA is now the world's largest oil producer. This is a strategic tactic. G20 is coming up. Imagine the blow to Iran if these countries start getting their oil from the USA.

4634 2018-11-05 16:16:12 Does Iraq really need to buy Iranian oil?
4635 2018-11-05 16:16:10 But they want to release the oil and are fighting people that want to protect it so it won’t get released

4655 2018-11-05 16:14:31 I think control of a region for all future political & intelligence strength is the real goal, resources (e.g., oil) is the byproduct. 'Directorate S' is a good dive into this, and the decisions made by both parties.

4664 2018-11-05 16:13:33 I love the whole process-buying it from a local artisan, choosing them, dipping them in water overnight, sunning them dry, filling the oil, making the wick, soaking it with ghee/oil, lighting them.

4699 2018-11-05 16:10:55 I want Trump not to be a whore especially when it comes to oil.

4752 2018-11-05 16:06:36 Pretty curious about those prices. Brazil in November at peak of between-crops period, with almost no soy left and high bean export premiums.

Crazy how many people tell me they know it better & that the summer in the netherlands made my vitamin D go from 23 to 71. I think it was rather the cod liver oil, raw liver, eggs and dairy
4781 2018-11-05 16:04:58 More sanctions planned.

Right. Is that before or after issuing waivers to all the countries Iran does business with - buying their oil - so that they aren't affected.

It sounds like tough talk, but the reality is that it's toothless and feckless.
4782 2018-11-05 16:04:58 I believe this is a terrible mistake. Although trump will be happy to continue buying Iranian oil.
4783 2018-11-05 16:04:57 I think big oil is backing 74 so they can try to get remuneration from the state if 112 passes and increases setbacks.  No on 74, Yes on 112.

4786 2018-11-05 16:04:38 It was peeled whole garlic. You had it with a table spoon from a bowl. One or two (small sized) garlic will come in every spoonful. I understand that the garlic itself is of not much value because all the oil has already infused into the milk. So one could just sip the milk.
4787 2018-11-05 16:04:31 Really 2016 oil was at $29 a barrel - wrote an article on Forex Magnates in January when basically Saudi Arabia was in deep $hit - Trump the whore had an opportunity last year to sort out the country dependent on the the price of oil the most.

Deepfry in hot oil to avoid absorption. 

Dip the battered fish in the hot oil and take it out only when both sides are well browned.

Look a little deeper, friend. There’s a reason the rest of the world holds a view of the US that doesn’t fit the “Savior/Protector” narrative that we tell ourselves. 

Start with oil, and follow down the rabbit hole.

4844 2018-11-05 16:01:18 Now that's cute! My dad took my niece with him to get an oil change and she went to the lady waiting and said "Im Rosie and I'm 3 and my birthday is November 12th, my daddy works in the woods and my mommy cooks on the mountain." Then took her seat.
4845 2018-11-05 16:01:16 Today I will sleep early, since I have to get up early at 4 am tomorrow to take oil bath n to celebrate Diwali.
4846 2018-11-05 16:01:10 @Psoriasis_CAPP I would like to say as someone that has suffered with Psoriasis for over 20 years is that I'm so glad that more and more people are talking about Psoriasis. I have always been looked at as a freak but ever since I started using cbd oil products my symptoms calmed
4847 2018-11-05 16:01:08 Quite right.Oil has weakened,Rand pretty much the same.Shoud be around  5% down.
4848 2018-11-05 16:01:07 So USA puts sanctions on Iran oil except if they sell to China , India , S Korea , Turkey etc . So no sanctions really . And the Donald is worried about destabilising oil prices too . I bet there will be lots cheap Iranian oil available if you ring Delhi.
4849 2018-11-05 16:00:58 Holy fuck I’m getting an oil change and two ppl are having the most casual conversation about jail. 

“Yeah Sarasota is the only one around I haven’t done any time in, bc I always get bailed out” 
“Lol yeah not me, I always get stuck there”

HOLY FUCK
4850 2018-11-05 16:00:47 Don’t sweat it, half these dudes can’t change their own oil or operate a lawn mower. All they know is analog sticks.
4851 2018-11-05 16:00:43 Only humans would come up with some store co2 to use it in oil extraction bullshit.
4852 2018-11-05 16:00:43 Me as well Big PHARMA Big Oil & Big Tobacco need to be charged with corporate terrorism.

Hey @ScottShuey US oil production is now high enough to *directly* drive US foreign policy. Is the whole Iran play just a transparent anti-competitive business move with one player making moves to lock out a competitor? (Other natl interests were better w 2015 deal)

4861 2018-11-05 15:59:37 Have I told you about the guy I met who was looking to employ some lobbyists to push his idea of supertankers full of piss?

Idea was to take empty supertankers, fill them with British piss, take it down to sahara, spray it, go back to oil exporting country and start again.
4862 2018-11-05 15:59:27 Awww! Looks like he's really trying to concentrate, focus his eyes & figure out what all this chaos is out here.

4867 2018-11-05 15:59:02 Pressed 101 for 5x5. Just cause @trishankkarthik 
Then I had some pressed coffee and olive oil @SeloSlav
4868 2018-11-05 15:58:54 MM's obviously went full risk off heading into sanctions. Waivers present multiple ways to play/consider the mkt now. 
1. Sign of supply tightness that US could not allow "maximum pressure" 
2. 6 mths of jawboning about "quota". 
3. Too much oil now being prod'ed b/c of waivers.
4869 2018-11-05 15:58:53 Well your thread as gently arranged as it is to drive at a point might not be correct for the Nigerian situation, as we read, even HSBC attest to shutting down branches globally and downsizing, and its a well known fact that these banks were used and are used for illicit Runs.

4872 2018-11-05 15:58:36 Good news. Iran oil purchase has 3 advantages: rupee payments accepted, longer period credit lines, and crucially, high quality of crude (saves India's refining costs). Clearly the US' chums the Saudis were not interested in even replicating these terms, let alone bettering them.
4873 2018-11-05 15:58:33 As far as that article is concerned regarding Man City, nothing will done because even those at the very top are influenced and corrupted by the oil money.

4891 2018-11-05 15:56:34 Brent crude oil prices fall from high of 86.74$/ barrel to 72.2$/barrel in just one month(nearly 16.7%).In India petrol prices cut by approx Rs 5(nearly 5.7%).We will praise our Pm if petrol prices in India fall due to roll back of excise duty hike not by fall due to brent fall.

4896 2018-11-05 15:56:04 So petrol increases 5 times in a raw by R0. 67c, R0. 40c.R0. 23c. R0. 37C and R0. 33c But then decrease by R0. 00c. (0.67+0.40+0.23+0.37+0.33-0.00= banana Republic)

4907 2018-11-05 15:55:37 Fashola is so correct, when there was oil boom and increased in oil revenue during the 16years rule of PDP, they didn't invest in technology, infrastructures, electricity, education, science, medical facilities etc., they spent money recklessly thus creating our current problems
4908 2018-11-05 15:55:36 But why are using more oil than prescribed Ma'am. This is causing pollution, inflation, hunger and social imbalance.

4914 2018-11-05 15:54:46 Saw this: The Trump administration is restoring all sanctions lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal in a bid to pressure Iran. They will hit oil exports, shipping and banks, and make it difficult to do business with the oil-rich nation.

4917 2018-11-05 15:54:34 The spill was hidden for six years before environmental watchdog groups stumbled on oil slicks while monitoring the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster a few miles north of the Taylor site in 2010.

4919 2018-11-05 15:54:21 A part of the hell that’s going on around the world today, has its roots with a refugee Neo Nazi German family that helped Adolph Hitler refine his oil in the Third Reich right there in Wichita Kansas! Read Jane Mayer’s book entitled “ Dark Money! “
4920 2018-11-05 15:54:19 Next he will complain about the price of oil going up

4923 2018-11-05 15:54:12 Would add that a lot of soya is eaten as soya, not just as oil. And how much is used as biofuel? Most meal goes to pigs and poultry - very little goes for cattle feed but the cattle-soya link is hyped. An area where misinformation abounds.

4945 2018-11-05 15:51:46 Not in nominal terms, the down trend in the rate of growth for jobs ( 2014- 2017) tied with the PMI recession, strong dollar/oil crash story has reversed in 2018 with a 30K trend better from 2017
That's a legit thesis but outside of that, no real material difference

4962 2018-11-05 15:49:56 The environment is important, but one does not need more money,  regulations, and government to enforce property rights, and big oil like anyone else can be brought to court for infringement of those rights. Propaganda is a street with many avenues of approach. Vote NO.

4972 2018-11-05 15:49:13 Scott how did you come up with life of 20years, fuel supply when you haven't drilled to determine if actual oil or gas is there.
4973 2018-11-05 15:49:13 The greatest want of the world is the want of men - men who will not be bought or sold, men who their innermost souls are true and honest,men who're ready to call sin by its right name and always stand for the right through the heaven fall ~ Ellen G. White

4978 2018-11-05 15:48:06 Hello Andrew. I don't share Rob's view that plant-based diets are either a fad or snake oil. But then I'm not a vegan or vegetarian. But I do try and eat mainly plant-derived food. A beef-diet could be sustainable if the cattle were as wildlife-friendly as Rob's are. Most aren't.

4984 2018-11-05 15:47:26 In  your latest commercial the Gov quotes, "remember the smoke?" So 1631 is going to help prevent brush fires? Are the oil companies causing those too or are you going after Mother Nature now?

4991 2018-11-05 15:47:00 LBJ spent the 3 decades before becoming president opposing all civil rights laws and helping oil men. I'm sure he'd win Texas today with that record, far more than that he would have run as a Democrat in the first place.

5012 2018-11-05 15:44:53 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund and the publisher of the National Enquirer. It has a mandate to support the oil companies and is working to introduce US style conservatism to Canada. It is propaganda, not news.
5013 2018-11-05 15:44:49 Pay off of oil executive, big gamer, Steve Chancellor, to add three more lion heads to his collection!   Between 1980 and 2008, Chancellor notched 482 confirmed kills. That includes 18 lions, 13 leopards, 11 blue wildebeests, 10 tsessebe (giant antelopes) and roughly 430 others.

5016 2018-11-05 15:44:32 You hit the nail on the head! For the sake of this country our oil should be piped across Canada and let nothing stop it!  Canadians are not aware of how we are being scammed by foreign interests.
5017 2018-11-05 15:44:28 Ndimi musina kudzidza. We all know the effect of controls, fixed exchange rate and government determined price of cooking oil. Give me the country to run, there won’t be cooking oil shortage in a week’s time even tisina soya beans.

5024 2018-11-05 15:43:39 I have asked this question to at least 10 people and no one knew the answer. what CBD Oil does the UK @NHS prescribe to epileptics and cancer pain patients . Which CBD oil won the contract? there are hundreds of them. which CBD Oil does the @NHSEnglandSouth use at this stage?
5025 2018-11-05 15:43:35 I'm a veteran and can only agree with you. Vietnam War: European plantation hegemony in SE Asia. The Cold War: Afghanistan's insanely vast cache of minerals. Iraq: Oil. Afghanistan: That insane cache of minerals again.
5026 2018-11-05 15:43:31 Are you aware we can service your car, even if it's under warranty?
Your warranty agreement stays exactly as it would if you go to a main dealer as we use warranty approved parts and oil. 
The only difference is we won't charge you anywhere near as much, so you win every time.
5027 2018-11-05 15:43:27 Mechanic says car that @Walmart broke after we took it in for simple oil change will be ready this Wednesday. No idea what final bill will be yet. Still driving a rental car. Our attorney requested that Walmart reply by last Friday to our claim and of course - they didn’t!
5028 2018-11-05 15:43:19 Nope, because america has shown historically it cares more about oil and money than human lives.
5029 2018-11-05 15:43:13 Fox business has a great article on the summit nov 30. Sounds like trump is more than willing to make a deal with China as long as China agrees to keep things fair. Also China may cut off oil from Iran and buy from US. What would this do to the price of Oil here. Up to $85ish?

- don’t wash you’re hair everyday. This could really damage your hair and it could get really frizzy.
- try not to brush your hair when it’s still wet.
- use coconut oil to deep condition your hair. This helps your hair to grow longer, thicker, and faster.
5032 2018-11-05 15:42:51 Can’t be solved by regulation anyway. Other countries cheat (look at China on intellectual property or OPEC on oil). No candidate will even be taken seriously. (As much as it is a risk). Same with asteroid defense. Dems barely even talk global warming any more.
5033 2018-11-05 15:42:50 I’m aware about CBD oil. Weed isn’t CBD oil though
5034 2018-11-05 15:42:44 Tips 

• Use coconut oil and castor oil. Part your hair and apply the oils to scalp. Massage into your scalp, then style your hair.

5043 2018-11-05 15:41:25 add 2-3 drops of tea tree oil and warm the solution in the microwave. If it’s too hot, let it cool down until it’s a comfortable temperature for you. Soak a cotton ball with the solution and hold it to your ear for about 5 mins everyday.

5049 2018-11-05 15:40:49 At 11 am solar was producing 5% of UK power. Given that installed capacity only allows for max 15-20% and it's a cloudy November day, that's not bad. 
Btw the way there's no equivalence between digging for lithium and the global damage inflicted by oil and gas extraction
5050 2018-11-05 15:40:47 Now we are going backwards.Clean air and water regulations are gone, ethics Dept gone ? The sale of our parks for oil.

5051 2018-11-05 15:40:43 Then I used my virgin yoni oil for the first time..... 
5052 2018-11-05 15:40:33 There is no way that taking oil out of the market, which these sanctions intend to do, can have any other effect on prices than to raise them! Simple supply and demand.

5068 2018-11-05 15:39:10 There’s a similar provision preventing the shipment of oil on sunken US flagged vessels between US ports: it’s called the Davy Jones Act.

Why don’t you sit this one out, study Article 4, and the 1951 convention on immigration. 
Until you do so, you’re nothing but a political snake oil salesman. You’re part of the reason we hate the media.

5103 2018-11-05 15:34:05 For all this talk of @GNev2 apologising, he  was over the top, but surely the bigger idiot’s @Carra23 for suggesting Spurs should blow £600m chasing a trophy with no way of sustaining it! Just look at Leeds & Portsmouth, where are they now? Citeh’s backed by an oil rich Sheik FFS
5104 2018-11-05 15:33:57 You drop plus the oil money p3 we dey go there

5109 2018-11-05 15:32:37 Is it? I thought there was mystery about which eight nations would not come under oil import sanctions. 
Thanks for sharing your views on US elections.
5110 2018-11-05 15:32:35 Your mention of Venezuela shows the level of your political and world affairs knowledge. It would be somewhere close to zero. Venezuela is the most oil rich nation on earth, it's also under massive sanctions from America who wants it's oil. No system would make Venezuela work...

5142 2018-11-05 15:29:59 So @realDonaldTrump & @SecPompeo only want European countries not to buy oil from Iran? Bigger question: why? For Russia to predominate their energy reliance?

5153 2018-11-05 15:29:29 @SquawkStreet  watching CNBC trying to spin oil uptake with fear mongering about Iran oil. As if any country cares about  dumbo don's sanctions. Who has "come to the table" because of his stupid trade policies? China is laughing at dumbo don, as is the rest of the world!

5160 2018-11-05 15:28:57 U.S. says 8 countries will receive sanctions waivers to allow them to still import Iranian oil at a reduced rate - Turkey, Japan, China, India, Italy, Greece, South Korea, Taiwan. Despite this  - Iran's economy will be hit hard.

5171 2018-11-05 15:28:00 Rev counter background makes more sense to be an indicator of something driving related, mode, shift light-type change, etc. 

Oil/water temps should be low or high, otherwise no news is good news. Unless you’re on track or somewhere where temps may need to be monitored/managed

5187 2018-11-05 15:25:24 What are you trying to say with this link? Some U.S. allies import Iranian oil, with the new sanctions we want them to stop, but we're giving them some time to stop. India is still a close strategic partner with the U.S. against the likes of China and to some extent Pakistan

5191 2018-11-05 15:23:32 Hey trump supporters @SecPompeo’s and @realdonaldtrump’s sanctions on Iran are bs. Iran can still sell oil under these sanctions. So the sanctions are just a stunt for the midterm elections. The don’t mean shit.

5195 2018-11-05 15:23:17 But you never mention where the money of this oil will go !!!! It will go to banks under the control of the US to buy food stuff for the Iranian people ... why don’t you say that ?????

Last night Pres Trump placed HEAVY Sanctions onto Iran. Banking, Oil n Industry sanctions. 
No more, Mr Muslim Obama, bucks for Iran.
5217 2018-11-05 15:20:49 (1)Sanctions on  is really Oil Sales pitch for buying ’s.(2)’exemptions’ reveal that  really put sanctions on importers of Oil rather than on .(3)Ignores existing possession of  Arms by .(4)Hence, sanctions are a farce much like NAFTA is now UCMCA.
5218 2018-11-05 15:20:48 USA officially announces Iran sanction waiver for India. 
This happens after India signs deal of buying S-400 from Russia and importing crude oil from Iran even after continuous sanction threat from USA. This is a colossal diplomatic victory for India since its independence. 1/2

5238 2018-11-05 15:18:57 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?
5239 2018-11-05 15:18:56 Once I realized that my hair couldn’t absorb coconut oil, my life changed for the better lol
5240 2018-11-05 15:18:43 Engine.  Need a new engine due to a design flaw where coolant can get into the engine oil and, well, the rest is history.  I have a Toyota Camry now!
5241 2018-11-05 15:18:40 Gotta change my cars oil anyways 
5242 2018-11-05 15:18:38 Let me check it out bro. Not too familiar with this name. What percent liquids is it ?more gassy or oil?
5243 2018-11-05 15:18:36 Why do they receive wavers when there is an over supply of oil worldwide? The world doesn’t need Iranian oil.
5244 2018-11-05 15:18:34 Coconut oil your hair, have a nap and don’t let boys make you feel like shit.
5245 2018-11-05 15:18:31 まあ社長権限で出荷されたならいいじゃないですか。

5247 2018-11-05 15:18:22 

There is a rather easy way for Iran & countries who do business w/them can get around monitoring of bank systems so Iran can provide 4 its PPL & countries can get their oil

If U R a non-profit, think how 'in-kind' contributions work 

It's what countries R working on doing
5248 2018-11-05 15:18:17 @guarnaschelli I have a question.... I love adding Dijon to olive oil to make dressing and marinades. I've always been able to emulsify the dressing but lately it just seperates. What am I doing wrong?
5249 2018-11-05 15:18:12 Wow, nice selection. I'm really llooking forward to reading some of theese as well. And thank you for including my book. :)
5250 2018-11-05 15:18:03 Naw, that shea butter and Jamaican castor oil 
5251 2018-11-05 15:18:00 It’s only gerrymandering when they’re in court with their lawsuit. Watch the redrawing of the maps become “everyone agrees it’s allowed” in about 2 years.
5252 2018-11-05 15:17:59 In UNSC vote to approve resolution on Libya, @RussiaUN notes that this process is another example of why the pen-holder system needs serious reform.  @USUN underscores the value of this resolution's intention to sanction spoilers and traffickers in oil and persons.
5253 2018-11-05 15:17:51 Today posiitve price action in Cdn Oil and Gas stocks more in line with the new trend my 30 Stock index i track (and posted ) has been signalling. Friday's move was counter to that and reason why I added to my position late in the afternoon. Coming off a low is always skittish
5254 2018-11-05 15:17:39 It is insane how much effort is going into the anti-112 campaign. This state isn’t as dependent on oil & gas as they want to make us think
5255 2018-11-05 15:17:38 ... and back home from a mini trip to France. Bought a few bottles of wine, oil and other necessities, and generally had a great time.
5256 2018-11-05 15:17:29 I believe it was I who tweeted about the great news in WSJ rather than the Blue person: in Aug the US became the world's largest oil exporter & in 2020 that will DOUBLE. FANTASTIC NEWS!!  See just how EXCEPTIONAL the USA is, Barack? Shouting intentional & from the housetops
5257 2018-11-05 15:17:29 Aren't these 2 on tv now the worst combo to call oil? My perception anyway
5258 2018-11-05 15:17:28 #Trump released in a conference that more than 20 nations have cut their oil trade with #Rouhani, the #Irani president. It will not effect #Pakistan at least owing to #Imrankhan deal with #SaudiArabia oil package deal. We should give chance to Iran @ #Gwader.
5259 2018-11-05 15:17:21 I wonder if a similar approach was adopted by oil companies, paint producers & pipe manufacturers before lead was banned from petrol, paint & pipes, respectively? Fortunately, common sense and government legislation prevailed. #writingisonthewall #missedopportunity #intransigence
5260 2018-11-05 15:17:11 Does anyone know who has the privilege of being torched at the #LewesBonfire? 

I've heard it can't be Philip Green or Arron Banks because they are too oily and oil spits
5261 2018-11-05 15:17:08 Thanks for your tweet, Kirsty. This is a really important issue and we’ve been at the forefront of driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years. We’re on track to meeting our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
5262 2018-11-05 15:17:08 疲れたー
5263 2018-11-05 15:16:57 Is that a clever reflection on how highly paid news actors only cover what their billionaire owners want, and never important things like how we are in massive debt from attacking at least seven countries that never attacked us for oil and money?
5264 2018-11-05 15:16:55 Reuters: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says Iran will sell its oil and break sanctions reimposed by the U.S.
5265 2018-11-05 15:16:50 After cutting down one third of our requirement of oil from Iran . US had granted time being relief ...... Great Diplomacy 
5266 2018-11-05 15:16:41 Ah baba oil company niyen o
5267 2018-11-05 15:16:39 Oil blocks are in the hands of private individuals while the owners of the commonwealth suffer....
5268 2018-11-05 15:16:35 #Iransanctions For Iraq, waivers were expected for gas, electricity and food. Does the fact that Iraq is not in the Pompeo's list of 8 mean that it will not get waiver at all or just that it is not in the list of oil waivers ? Any clue ?
5269 2018-11-05 15:16:31 You cannot slick a can of oil.
5270 2018-11-05 15:16:30 Yeah when we get these resources from China and other countries, they have the toughest environmental rules, good thing our environment is a different one than theirs.
Pipelines are the safest mode of transportation of oil/gas.
5271 2018-11-05 15:16:28 its rude how people are still cooking hashbrowns in butter instead of oil
5272 2018-11-05 15:16:23 China and India will be happy to buy the oil and give Trump the middle finger.  Europe would just blabla their way out

5275 2018-11-05 15:16:16 The energy& oil crisis, companies moving overseas, the rise of libertarian-republican political & social policies, decreased spending on education contributed to todays danger points. The word 'modest' to me implys that low & lower raises are all workers deserve.  Thanks.
5276 2018-11-05 15:16:13 Oh, and it also came with $75 in 'Freecash' in three $25 monthly installments, the first of which I used to get 2 gallons of bar oil for free. No idea if Sears will last another 2 months, but if they do I'll have another $50 worth of free stuff coming.
5277 2018-11-05 15:16:11 When I lived in the mountains, this is the time of year when I'd be scouting for firewood,.  Just had a flashback.  No longer need to get fuel oil and firewood.  Do miss the mountains though -- sometimes desperately but then a mind check needs doing.  LOL
5278 2018-11-05 15:15:58 Yeah, but $19 oil prices has nothing to do with BOC's monetary policy, at least IMO. How do you think those 2 are connected with each other? Curious to know your take.
5279 2018-11-05 15:15:51 No, they’d plow it out of the way to see if there were any oil under it. Do you really think republicans give a shit about native Americans? You must be sniffing glue.

5287 2018-11-05 15:15:01 Good bye cruel world ive had a good life *me after binge watching Netflix all night then getting up with my kids*
5288 2018-11-05 15:14:53 Thank you for the clarification. Is there oil on the bridge making it slick in the rain?
5289 2018-11-05 15:14:38 electricity and radio waves aren't finite natural resources
also tranmission lines are not even remotely similar types of physical infrastructure to an oil pipeline
5290 2018-11-05 15:14:37 If you studied permian production you would understand how lack of take away capacity for associated gas curtails oil production. But then I guess you don't know s##t about that.

5299 2018-11-05 15:13:50 Nothing like the smell of hydraulic oil on a Monday morning

5301 2018-11-05 15:13:44 My favorite #Deepawali memory/moment as a young boy growing up in Mumbai (in early/mid- 80s)....:
1. Feel of warm oil on your scalp at early morning (4/4:30 AM)....
2. Smell of gunpowder wafting thru the air (which is still my #Deepawali fav. )
5302 2018-11-05 15:13:39 Oil is gonna run out soon, why don't we just make make new oil 
5303 2018-11-05 15:13:23 Pure evil. It's hard to realize that there are so many people fooled by Islam, that hate God and Hate America.

But it's true, and we all need to never forget these truths, as we read and follow God's Word, and clean and oil our AR15's.

5310 2018-11-05 15:13:01 It gets under my skinnnn. 
Some of them go to the extent of telling my mom to force me to convert because I'm her child and she has the right to control me. I had one aunt that used to sign a cross on my forehead with holy oil when my mom wasn't around.
5311 2018-11-05 15:12:55 Three grams of legal weed is now worth the same as a barrel of Alberta oil and one of our homegrown major energy companies just dropped another $5.5B in the U.S. What are we doing in this country?
5312 2018-11-05 15:12:51 I was backing you through all this until you said "oil your beard". Then I just buss out laughing 
5313 2018-11-05 15:12:37 Bushiri’s oil
5314 2018-11-05 15:12:34 That's right Richard. There will come a time that Venezuela's oil will become so valuable to other countries that Trump will be ignored. When that happens the USA  will try to find a way of controlling and profiting from that oil I believe.
5315 2018-11-05 15:12:27 This is what happens when you sanction Iran.  Obama/Kerry warned about it...we know the world was circumventing these sanctions w/gold.  The US is forcing oil to bid for gold.  Oil is 10x the size of gold in physical terms.  Grab the popcorn
5316 2018-11-05 15:12:22 I don’t want to pay for this high ass oil change 
5317 2018-11-05 15:12:17 Only in grad school do perfectly adult activities like grocery shopping and oil changes feel like a totally irresponsible allocation of time
5318 2018-11-05 15:12:13 What is the best treatment for reducing the appearance of scars after surgery?!  Vitamin E gel? Almond oil? @CarolineHirons  you're my usual go-to for skincare but I can't find any advice about scarring on your site  #pleasehelp
5319 2018-11-05 15:12:07 I thought the traditional term (at least in the USA) was "snake oil".
5320 2018-11-05 15:12:06 What’s the point of sanctions???@realDonaldTrump the great negotiator has waived  sanctions n allowed Iran to sell oil to India n China
5321 2018-11-05 15:11:47 Got two job opportunities, one is to be a welder for bnsf or go back to an oil drilling rig in Long Beach...... I’m torn between the two

5335 2018-11-05 15:10:35 Yeah, but we never bow to them and never will be, our advantage with for importing oil from Iran is we can give our Indian rupee instead of dollar for every purchase. Also we we are on the projects which agreed by Iran n Russia  before is ongoing , we are not gonna step back.

5357 2018-11-05 15:08:29 I recommend using a pure oil (like squalane) on your dry bits and try not to over cleanse. If you can manage with just an oil cleanser, you’ll retain SO much more moisture. 
5358 2018-11-05 15:08:24 Nigeria made N207.54bn from crude oil & gas export between Jan-Jun, falling short of the FG’s target of N661.38bn.

5361 2018-11-05 15:08:05 I have a few lamps like this and other oil types. Great when the power is out or just to set a mood. A scented oil would be nice.
5362 2018-11-05 15:07:59 That’s cuz when you dyed it your hair is dryer so now your scalp wants to over produce oil to nourish it. Coconut oil helps but also sleeping in deep conditioner is great too and get a color safe moisturizing shampoo & conditioner
5363 2018-11-05 15:07:57 I like coming here for my oil change and inspections. Quick service and sometimes they vacuum my car for free.

5368 2018-11-05 15:07:37 "FREE"   advice for your health ! Take Flax seed oil everyday because it   has more omega 3's than omega 6's.  Omega 3's  inhibit inflammation,   whereas omega 6's increase inflammation.  Fish and fish oils contain   more omega 3's but they may also contain mercury or radiation.

To enhance your leadership, keep the price of goods (food, water etc) down as much as possible so your citizens don't suffer due to @realDonaldTrump unwarranted sanctions. His plan all along was to give the oil contract to Saudi Arabia!!!!!!
5405 2018-11-05 15:04:45 All lies. They can't prove a thing. A tax on oil companies is a tax on you when they raise their prices.  Then the state puts its hand in your other pocket by raising our gas tax over 100%. Yeah, more taxation with zero quantitative accountability has ALWAYS been a brilliant idea

Ask her to do this for few minutes and then wear a loose pyjama so ur legs remain warm, it should do the trick.
5427 2018-11-05 15:03:06 Oui il faut trouver des solutions aux gros pbs écologiques. Personne ne le nie. Mais quelles sont les alternatives mises en place? Et depuis quand le gaz oil à 1,5  euro pollue moins que le gaz oil. à 1,2 euro? Quid de la mobilité pour le travail?

5434 2018-11-05 15:02:23 Today, the US imposed new and tougher sanctions on Iran, which will hurt its oil, banking and shipping sector. While the people of Iran suffer, this will help Saudi Arabia, the US ally in the fight against Muslims.

5451 2018-11-05 15:01:01 If the earth has reached the tipping point as some suggest, then why aren't world governments sinking resources into finding alternative viable green energy that would replace oil based derivatives? Simple answer is they already know it ain't going to end in 12 yrs.
5452 2018-11-05 15:00:50 That's what I do, never used it on it's own. I've also never used that kind, I use the one with olive oil
5453 2018-11-05 15:00:46 So the government is allowing the oil companies to destroy the environment, extract wealth and leave the damages to people to pay. This is unacceptable. This is what you get when the gov. is bought and paid for by big oil.

5462 2018-11-05 15:00:08 I think that us individuals should be more aware of the products we use. Whether that is to consume or toiletries to use.

5504 2018-11-05 14:56:30 From scientific point of view, it is very good for health to do Lighting Lamps. Due to the fragrance of lamp oil, the germs of the disease become destroyed Hence it's a must to  decorate the Lamps

5505 2018-11-05 14:56:23 CBD oil is already readily available, so why do people in pain need smokable marijuana? Genuinely curious. Is it cheaper? Does the high have medicinal benefits as well?
5506 2018-11-05 14:56:17 Wei dier 3y3 crude oil
5507 2018-11-05 14:56:08 All morality is subjugated to oil.
5508 2018-11-05 14:56:06 It maybe the future, but for me bike racing is about the smell oil, fuel, exhaust gases.
The roar of the engine and the sound coming out of the exhaust. People spend hours watching mechanics warm bikes up in pit lane just listening to that engine being revved
5509 2018-11-05 14:56:02 Ini yg basic

5510 2018-11-05 14:56:00 Immediately erased all government research on climate change would be the FIRST example. Opened the entire continental shelf to oil drilling. Shrunk national monuments and opened them to industry. Deregulated important EPA rules.
5511 2018-11-05 14:55:59 When Manmoham singh was PM,  remember the sanctions that followed when we purchased Oil from Iran.
5512 2018-11-05 14:55:59 Mlevu, be honest, how would you feel if it turns out there wasn't any oil/gas? How would you feel if there was?
5513 2018-11-05 14:55:58 God, I hate talking to VW about servicing. Always answered by a no-nothing girl who simply doesn't know what it is you'll be paying for. £220.00 for oil and a filter is all I can gather. Fecks sake ...
5514 2018-11-05 14:55:57 Hopefully cannibus oil will be legal soon to assist you guys
5515 2018-11-05 14:55:22 Once weed comes legal in all states, there will be more weird things getting put in those strains. CBD oil price goin to rocket and they will still jail ppl it w/o a license to sell. I can already see it.
5516 2018-11-05 14:55:22 Bring on the squirrel oil!

5526 2018-11-05 14:54:16 I'm just kidding xD..
I only use olive oil in my cooking
5527 2018-11-05 14:54:13 Just like oil and water.
5528 2018-11-05 14:54:08 You are telling me no more Iranian oil for Namibia?   What an outrage, but sure get Iranians to toe the line
5529 2018-11-05 14:54:04 It's insane how delusional certain healthcare "professionals" can just to make a buck and sell some snake oil.
5530 2018-11-05 14:54:02 apparently if u rub oil on ur lash line it’s suppose to help take them off but idk bc i’ve never done it
5531 2018-11-05 14:53:58 They NEED to have "daddy" take care of them.
They never earned anything themselves, been taken care of their entire lives. It's no wonder these leeches are in rapture for this snake oil salesman, he tells them he will take care of them. It reduces their panic of self sufficiency.

5534 2018-11-05 14:53:47 Not palm oil though, that's the worse thing ever... It's not healthy for you or the Earth...
5535 2018-11-05 14:53:46 Don’t itch them! Scratching your belly can cause stretch marks! When they it’s pat them or rub coconut oil on it! Your skin can just be more sensitive right now because of the pregnancy

5539 2018-11-05 14:53:33 I've accepted product re-namings for pretty much all products now - CIF is fine, Oil of Olay is OK. It's a Snickers not a Marathon and I'm happy with that. The Immac/Veet thing doesn't bother me.

But I just can't seem to accept Opal Fruits are Starburst.

It's been 20 years.
5540 2018-11-05 14:53:32 Coconut oil is a life saver for me

5543 2018-11-05 14:53:05 spooz didn't really get the idea due to oil spike today. nq very normal.
5544 2018-11-05 14:53:05 *The Next World War is less than a week away!!* check it out....

1. USA has set Sunday November 4 as the last day that the nations of the world have permission to buy oil from Iran

2. Russia, China nd India announce tht they will continue buying Iranian oil despite US threats
5545 2018-11-05 14:53:03 Abeg who is this A A Oil

5552 2018-11-05 14:52:22 Diabetic? :(
And, yes - you're getting better at it.
I've been dosing a cat with Laxotone (which I think is cod liver oil with flavoring; turned into a gel).  Getting good at it. Inky still complains loudly; won't eat it voluntarily (but doesn't struggle)!
5553 2018-11-05 14:52:19 But I usually use coconut oil or almond oil, but if I'm in Cyberjaya or I'm outstation, I use a organic oil based soap... It's better tbh, doesn't make you look ashy especially if you have darker skin...
5554 2018-11-05 14:52:16 this is all about oil.
5555 2018-11-05 14:52:16 then we'll stop fighting about silly things such as oil and cultural differences and start wars about who is best girl
5556 2018-11-05 14:51:55 Cooked another roast yesterday & have now got my roast potato technique down cold: 

Boil yukon gold potatoes until they’re soft as shit. Let them cool before I dip & coat in peanut oil, rosemary, thyme, salt & pepper. Heat at 525F turning once to brown all sides *chef’s kiss*
5557 2018-11-05 14:51:54 India buy oil from Iran!
No sanctions on India

India buys S-400 defence system from Russia 
No sanctions on India

India carried out surgical strikes:

5560 2018-11-05 14:51:28 Urmmm you do know that the same sesame oil that was used for cooking is also used to bath... My dad told me this when I was younger and I was shooketh...
5561 2018-11-05 14:51:16 Waiting to see impact of end of refinery turnaround season.  Believe it is partially but not fully responsible. Entire system is backed up.  CBR ramp to 455k bbl/d + announced ~120k bbl/d of heavy oil shut ins key in 2019 to normalize diffs. Should know better in a few weeks.
5562 2018-11-05 14:51:14 It’s one thing to use EIA numbers, it’s another to come out and say we expect global oil supply will increase in the second half of 2019
5563 2018-11-05 14:51:14 Have you tried a mixture of baking soda and tea tree oil for exfoliating? 1 part tea tree oil 3 parts water with a teaspoon of BS for each extra use

5576 2018-11-05 14:50:19 Come in for an oil change and you end up needing filters replaced that you’ve never even heard of 
5577 2018-11-05 14:50:18 Literal oil, slathered all over my face. What skin type do you have?
5578 2018-11-05 14:50:11 I accidentally poured eucalyptus oil everywhere and my room REEKS
5579 2018-11-05 14:50:10 Can I use cooking oil ?
5580 2018-11-05 14:50:05 But you are speaking of oil and gas here. There is so much more. I love the NDP, Alberta NDP, mind you. Not typically a voter of NDP.

5582 2018-11-05 14:49:49 This is a really important issue and we’ve been at the forefront of driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years. We’re on track to meeting our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
5583 2018-11-05 14:49:37 As I have off tomorrow, after voting I will take a mentally healthy approach to my day to do maintenance. Oil change for the car, hair cut for me.

5607 2018-11-05 14:47:41 The part where the billons of gallons of contaminated water is injected into abandoned wellls is terrifying. Add to that the FACT that oil and gas is billions $ upside down on fracking-we can be sure that they will bail eventually and leave the citizens to deal with the aftermath
5608 2018-11-05 14:47:40 Macros have now turned favourable for Indian markets which will act as a big tailwind going forward. “I’m always bullish on India & do not see any reason to be bearish.

5630 2018-11-05 14:45:36 @realDonaldTrump We are only satisfied with a certain condition, the Iranian regime can not receive its oil money in any currency, not dollars, not euros, not yuan, not lira, no currency, and Swift should be cut off completely. If there is not an option, sanctions are useless

5641 2018-11-05 14:44:36 Oh my god, people. Save your minis and reuse them as single serving bottles of balsamic vinaigrette and olive oil to pack in your lunch!
5642 2018-11-05 14:44:36 LMAO!!!
5643 2018-11-05 14:44:36 Well, while he's gone, we can get a clean up crew. Get this sludge outta Gnomer. I don't mind pink colors, maybe get some tinkers to fix the bots to stop leaking oil everywhere. Need some hydroponics going on. Make it a real city.
5644 2018-11-05 14:44:28 "#oil is the global economy’s most important commodity and Canada’s largest export. However, movements in the oil market tend to reflect more the impact of unexpected changes in supply or demand than shifts in global economic trends" and some more like that on page 5
5645 2018-11-05 14:44:19 OK management is saying people come and purchase cooking oil then go out in the suburbs and resale in at 7$,they hope that by asking customers to make 15$ purchases those people will not buy
5646 2018-11-05 14:44:09 Perhaps Eastern Canada can displace the Saudi Oil it currently buys with some nice Iranian crude.  After all, in Trudeau’s Canada anything shipped in tankers is better than buying oil piped from Alberta.

5673 2018-11-05 14:40:21 With the reimposed Iran sanction by the US, Oil prices will surely jump
5674 2018-11-05 14:40:19 It’s been grand for the top hasn’t it? 138% while MAJORITY of us are stagnating.   My retirement has been on a downward spiral since January 2018, oil prices are up, tarries are killing auto sales. Do you do the grocery shopping? Maybe you should check that out.
5675 2018-11-05 14:40:15 In '56 Ike sent Robert Anderson to see King Saud. His assignment: push King to help resolve Suez Crisis. Anderson told King that US had learned how to produce competitive nuclear energy. World wouldn't need as much oil. 
"The Prize" p.488

5676 2018-11-05 14:40:14 The economy has been tanked for a long time, so it won't be all Trump's fault. Since the value of money is based on your word,(credit), and oil, facing the facts,(cuts), is suicide. I know it. You know it. Instead of Negative 101, how about some positive endurance. yack away

5680 2018-11-05 14:39:51 After doing my own research I can’t find the anti- LGBTQ. Yes, big oil is a legit talking point BUT let’s be real, both parties accept money from wherever they can get it. We will never be 100% renewable because you need petroleum to produce the parts and for maintenance. 
5681 2018-11-05 14:39:47 Giving the middle finger to the EU. These sanctions are meaningless. Iran can sell their oil to whoever they please. Where’s the sanctions on SA,

5691 2018-11-05 14:38:50 It's time to destroy the oil industry and replace it with American coal and electric vehicles! No more supporting countries that treat women like cattle and murder gays! And guess what? It'll be better for the environment than a stupid carbon tax!
5692 2018-11-05 14:38:45 I need a candle lit home made dinner and a hot oil massage for all I been through lol
5693 2018-11-05 14:38:35 use witch hazel & then afterwards use some type of oil for your face like coconut oil or cocoa butter. if you use it you have to make sure your face moisturized after!
5694 2018-11-05 14:38:32 I remember when I was still little. I was told to fry eggs. I used kerosene as the oil because it was the same color . Let's not talk about what my parents did to me. 
5695 2018-11-05 14:38:25 “Tough new sanctions” that *checks notes* exempt the 8 biggest importers of Iranian oil. Another smokescreen and another failure in headline writing from the media. They fall for it every single time.
5696 2018-11-05 14:38:24 The exceptions (countries given a by to purchase Iranian oil), the Iranians will have plenty of income. When the first domino lies, the rest follow.
5697 2018-11-05 14:38:23 Somehow we're jamming oil/gas sector, healthcare, financials, and industrials -- because all of those sectors have turned around bigly in this global macro slowdown.  LOL.  Watch volume on $SPY.  Seems flawed.

5701 2018-11-05 14:38:07 And by 2020, U.S. oil export will DOUBLE.  From today's Wall Street Journal. #MAGA
5702 2018-11-05 14:38:01 @jimcramer 2 -3 weeks ago you said that oil was going higher.  Now you say its going lower.  All you do is follow what the market is doing.  Nothing yo support your case.  You are like the wind, here today gone tomorrow. Thanks for nothing Jim.  You disappoint me.
5703 2018-11-05 14:38:00 It's because of an agreement we have with Saudi Arabia that as long as we go to war in the middle East they will only sell their oil in us dollars to keep the demand of us dollars up if we broke this deal they could stop and flood our markets with more money causing inflation
5704 2018-11-05 14:37:59 Today marks clear success for Washington imo:
- US was able to negotiate agreements with major importers of Iranian oil including China and India
- Able to get SWIFT at least partially on board despite EU pressure
- Meanwhile, EU counter-measures, are nowhere to be seen
5705 2018-11-05 14:37:58 Before starting your snow blower for the first time, make sure it's filled with a high-quality SAE 30 weight. Always use quality motor oil as indicated by the API service symbol.

5713 2018-11-05 14:37:26 Does beard oil really work?
5714 2018-11-05 14:37:21 I don’t use it for health benefits but it makes for a good dressing when I’m out of fresh lemons. I add a splash to a healthy serving of villa capellini olive oil add salt and pepper to taste. Great with arugula and parm.
5715 2018-11-05 14:37:19 We should have used SWIFT to the fullest, granted NO waivers, sold the oil ourselves making whatever deal we had to, and squeezed the GC, IRGC and Basij until they were GONE. It would be the cheapest out. If they use that $ and continue in SYR there WILL be regional war.All weaps

5717 2018-11-05 14:37:08 Well,India got the US waiver to import Iranian crude oil & what prevents us to complete Pak-Iran Gas pipeline? Fear of US sanctions!!!It's ridiculously awful.This is how the statesmanship works & countries seek their national interests no matter what.

why are you pumping the stock market then? 
this  always wrong on OIL prediction

5723 2018-11-05 14:36:59 Why not report that numerous countries dependent upon oil from Iran have been given an exemption?
5724 2018-11-05 14:36:50 Oil.... Oil is our problem
5725 2018-11-05 14:36:45 Actually China said they’d be willing to import oil from the U.S. instead of Iran.
5726 2018-11-05 14:36:40 Sort of.  Diesel can be made from vegetable oil and hydrogen. It’s a complicated and expensive process but it woks.  Hemp is a vegetable oil.  There is a range of effectiveness between different oils but I think Hemp is a good one
So then from diesel you can make plastics, etc

5729 2018-11-05 14:36:10 For decades this Iranian regime has spent billions of dollars of the oil revenue on terrorist activities. It's time for the people of Iran to ask #WhereIsTheOilMoney ?

5731 2018-11-05 14:36:01 Michaels & Maue want us to bet the future of all life on Earth. They want us to put all our chips on...burning billions of barrels of oil and billions of tons of coal...even though their arguments are based on unsupported lies, whilst they cash paychecks from the Koch brothers.”
5732 2018-11-05 14:36:00 @narendramodi  as U.S. impose sanction on Iran we may get waiver but we have to think of some renewable sources of energy as a substitute for petrol diesel because once crude oil exhausted we need some kind of innovation that will make us self dependent on energy source

5757 2018-11-05 14:33:46 And, obviously, trump is sanctioning Iran, dictated by his king, who, obviously, is doing the world the favour to pump more oil to sell to everybody (Canadians included, even if we don't need it!) and betraying the same Americans and their votes! Disgusting!
5758 2018-11-05 14:33:42 China says its lawful trade cooperation with Iran should be respected,no comment on if it had been granted exemption waivers for oil imports.

The Coconut Oil has reset on the surface resulting in the white areas. This effect will not impact the performance. Please check DM for further info, thank you
5770 2018-11-05 14:31:57 I also think oil is a buy and have sold puts last night..But we all have to admit that US production keeps on surging beyond expectations, Russian production making a post USSR high and OPEC pumping above consensus.

5772 2018-11-05 14:31:55 With satellites with high-resolution cameras that can track even an ant on the planet, U think it is difficult to find them? The world's wealthiest families, the world's most powerful leaders act only when they smell Profit.  Cameroon has no oil no gas no minerals no gold nothing
5773 2018-11-05 14:31:47 US Hook says Washington will re-assess in May (180 days) today's waivers, exemptions. Doesn't rule in or out continuing some. Says will depend on progress in diplomacy and on developments in oil markets. #IranDeal
5774 2018-11-05 14:31:09 For decades this Iranian regime has spent billions of dollars of the oil revenue on terrorist activities. It's time for the people of Iran to ask #WhereIsTheOilMoney ?

5802 2018-11-05 14:29:22 Sure. Standard of livings increase as the cost of living decreases, regardless of the nationality of the producer lowering the price. Compare oil to steel. Trump is actually telling OPEC to lower oil prices, doesn't he care about our oil producers?
5803 2018-11-05 14:29:21 How much is the oil?

5808 2018-11-05 14:28:56 I'd say all forms of oppression are at some level intertwined to serve the needs of capitalism and white supremacy but Islamophobia and antisemitism especially, I think due to geopolitical control over the Middle East and it's oil
5809 2018-11-05 14:28:53 c'est à dire que ce sont des termes subjectifs, anthropocentrés, relatant un point de vue, et non une description objective et journalistique de la situation (température, vitesse du vent etc)

5842 2018-11-05 14:25:32 Which is worse?

Man City being backed and bankrolled by a load of oil money or Man United being backed and bankrolled by a load of banks with horror debt records that taxpayers have already bailed out once in the last 10 years.

5876 2018-11-05 14:24:01 Translation: Iran sells to Turkey. Turkey sells to USA, just as they did with stolen Iraqi oil sold by ISIS.

5891 2018-11-05 14:22:29 Sudan has sanctions that prevent all exports to the US except gum arabic. That's because Coca-Cola and Pepsi cannot manufacture their product without it, and 70% of the world's gum arabic comes from Sudan. You really think the administration is not going to buy Iranian oil?
5892 2018-11-05 14:22:28 Most places that fry foods share fryer oil for everything and it’s a haven for cross contamination. Only eat fries if they have a dedicated fryer that doesn’t have, e.g., chicken strips or other breaded food.
5893 2018-11-05 14:22:26 Great diplomatic victory for India. This will keep our oil prices in check. 

But we need to reduce dependence on oil by aggressively supporting Electric Vehicles and biofuels. This will also reduce air pollution problem.

5941 2018-11-05 14:18:52 Oil is where Iran’s terrorism money comes from. Trump’s sanctions just hurt innocent people.
5942 2018-11-05 14:18:41 All genuine evil crime lords are smuggling oil from West Africa or people from Honduras or something else like that. Sedans can't cut it. That's why they (and the various corrupt warlords they're paying off) all drive G-Classes nowadays. Just sayin'

5954 2018-11-05 14:18:01 Perez is an idiot. The current inflation rate is below 3%, so his math is totally wrong.Further, gas prices are more a function of oil prices and this administration is being very active in finding ways to ease our dependence on foreign oil, which is good for gas prices. #idiot.

5963 2018-11-05 14:17:24 Who would fund the country if Trump gave the middle class a tax break after his massive tax break he gave to the wealthy? Trump will continue to rob the middle class to make his himself and his friends wealthier. DONOT BELIEVE THE LIES OF A SNAKE OIL SALESMAN!

6045 2018-11-05 14:11:35 It means many can no longer get oil from Iran(among other things) and those that still can, can only do so at half the volume. Notice the EU is not on the waiver list. And if you think this isn’t crippling, look at the response from Iran.

6177 2018-11-05 14:01:41 Also it’s worth noting that Iran & Saudi Arabia are at war in Yemen. The Saudis worked with Russia to get Trump elected. Russia get those sanctions lifted ($450B in oil) Saudi gets sanctions on Iran to stop them from building a nuke.

6199 2018-11-05 14:00:41 Waivers are only till March 2019 that too with a condition that India will have to reduce its supply from Iran. Supply will go down globally increasing prices. We have to pay for oil in dollars which will definitely lead to greater CAD. The devil is in the fine print.

6243 2018-11-05 13:57:49 Waiting to see if any Turkish media outlets point out that the waiver for Iranian oil is temporary. And does anyone know for long these temporary waivers are in place for? Does the USG have a cut-off date for countries are expected to decrease their imports of Iranian oil?
6244 2018-11-05 13:57:48 This ignores the waivers for some oil imports

6254 2018-11-05 13:57:04 the US has become the largest oil producer in the world, so getting iran's oil off the global mkt and having the price of oil go up actually benefits Trump and the oil industry. probably just a coincidence -).  oil will go back up as soon as the elections are over.

6313 2018-11-05 13:52:43 U.S. issues eight waivers from #Iran oil #sanctions. #China, #India, #Italy, #Greece, #Japan, #South_Korea, #Taiwan and #Turkey allowed to continue "temporary" oil imports.
6314 2018-11-05 13:52:42 Except on oil importers, who will get a pass.
6315 2018-11-05 13:52:39 Latest U.S. sanctions on Iran took effect Monday, but their impact on global oil markets may not be as severe as expected,after a 8 countries were granted temporary exemptions.

6317 2018-11-05 13:52:34 Trump needs China in order to get a "win" with NKorea. He also hopes to apply sanctions without making oil prices go up.
6318 2018-11-05 13:52:32 Lol. @realDonaldTrump exempted the 8 largest oil purchasers, therefore the sanctions are meaningless

6327 2018-11-05 13:52:02 Surely other countries can safely rely on the stability and sanity-of-mind of Saudi Arabia for all of their oil. Specially the US should lean as much as possible on Saudi Arabia, let's see how that works out.

6330 2018-11-05 13:51:42 Of course, the @WSJ headlines fails to@mention that with the 8 oil exemptions, the sanctions are meaningless
6331 2018-11-05 13:51:38 This is great news for Trump’s Saudi allies. Horrible news for Americans. 

If the Saudis can’t, or won’t, meet the output lost by reimposing sanctions on Iran, oil prices go up.

This adds more pain to American citizens and industries already hit by tariffs, slowing consumption.

6457 2018-11-05 13:43:29 While getting my car inspected today, I saw The Today Show dryly talking about the drop in oil prices and where some states will see $2.00/gallon. $2.00!! No enthusiasm, no kudos to the economy, just “yawn”. $2 WITH Iranian sanctions. HUGE win for @realDonaldTrump and Americans.

6483 2018-11-05 13:41:40 Actually the point was very simple in WW2. It was to preserve the British empire. Hence the lack of concern at the 3m+ Indians who died of starvation when Churchill grabbed Indian crops to send to Britain.

6601 2018-11-05 13:34:10 That’s why I keep hot sauce, salt, pepper, soy sauce, sesame oil, and stolen packets of Pizza Hut crushed red pepper and Parmesan at my desk. Something will save the day

6603 2018-11-05 13:33:50 While oil might have been a factor it was not the reason. Look at the world today, a world suffering from perpetual warfare and financial turmoil. Then consider the Iraq War was only a precursor to what we have in Syria, Yemen, Ukraine; all directed against Russia.

1. Get the oil bath with extra oil 
2. Eat chicken and mutton like never eaten before 
3. Find all the married couple and beg for “deepavali cash” 
4. Gossip only with my family hoping nobody comes all of a sudden

6612 2018-11-05 13:33:25 I smell amazing! I’m obsessed with perfume but today I wore an oil and it fits me perfectly.
6613 2018-11-05 13:33:19 I went to N-Richards Masasa after the shop had closed around 7pm. Behind the shop were mountains of cooking oil boxes being loaded onto the kombis and lorries. This is despite that customers had been told that there were no cooking oil. The relevant authorities must act on this.

6627 2018-11-05 13:31:39 Still looking for reversal for oil in the mid to low 60's with final support at 58. Is this the bottom? Will need to verify with upcoming inventory reports, but as equities usually lead, I will take this opportunity to continue to load up on O&G E&Ps as the bottom is near. #OOTT
6628 2018-11-05 13:31:34 More sanctions or Iran? Or subsidizing oil companies with higher prices for a good month or two?

6638 2018-11-05 13:30:29 Nooooo surprise!!!

Canada’s economy is only surviving because the government is racking in the tax money on inflated gas, oil and electricity prices and next: pot.

Only the government claims the economy is booming...!!!

I actually mix alot of things trying to experiment. Key stuff is the melted shea butter, honey and coconut oil.

6645 2018-11-05 13:29:45 I Like how the people we voted into power are stylishly waiting for another oil boom to fix up a lot of issues, inclusive of our ever mounting debts. Don't worry our miracle is on the way.

Cold pressed olive oil shouldn't be used for anything other than shallow frying as it has a low smoke point 160°. It's no good for stir frying or deep frying where you need a high smoke point.

Rapeseed smoke point is 190-232°
Coconut oil 177-232°

6723 2018-11-05 13:22:36 Scotland becomes independent, then uses a few decades of Oil profits to *wind down* Oil & Gas production in its move toward 100% renewables, whilst the rUK is many decades behind, finding increasing difficulty securing supply, creating more war debt that Scotland owes none of.
6724 2018-11-05 13:22:33 This is the most important missed message especially to millennials. We need to be reaching them thru social media & on the ground & let them know that this government gives super low interest rate loans to oil companies but gouges THEM. Democrats are committed to changing that!

And a lot other nice ones I don’t know but the highest priced ones are usually k45(most of them are k25/k30) and they’re either 750mls or 1L
6751 2018-11-05 13:20:18 I have no special products or routine tbh.
I hate oil in my hair and stuff.

#NoOn74 -it’s a roundabout measure to bankrupt the CO government if #Prop112 passes

#YesOn112 -Fracking Ban
6755 2018-11-05 13:19:56 I see tesla as the battle between evil & good in the world no joke even if it sounds crazy. If Oil is down war stop & energy is free that change everything. I agree with you Vijay "sustainable cashflow" that happens when we have 200k more M3 on the road preferably around WallSt

6768 2018-11-05 13:18:37 Business Insider article:
Countries getting oil from Iran can still buy it, but the money goes into an escrow account, Iranians can't touch it until sanctions are lifted!!!!

Brilliant!

6770 2018-11-05 13:18:35 The money from crude oil is not enough - we already run the economy at a deficit (budget deficit). The crude is apparently not even enough to finance our petroleum needs without leading to scarcity issues and other costs are still there including salaries.
6771 2018-11-05 13:18:27 ขอบคุณมากค่าาา
6772 2018-11-05 13:18:18 A can of worms Roman. Australia was under no threat, someone else's war for oil and plunder. Based on lies about imaginary WMD's. Millions of civilians dead & huge refugee problem thanks to Howard. Use of depleted uranium in Iraq still wreaks havoc now.  For what? For what?
6773 2018-11-05 13:18:11 ... encore des températures pas du tout suspectes pour un début de mois de novembre...
6774 2018-11-05 13:18:10 Is it oil or acrylic?
6775 2018-11-05 13:18:03 I have just read the weekly financial headlines this morning.

FDI in Q3 was about ₦200billion.

Oil export revenue drops to ₦403billion.

Not good. Not good at all.

I see dollar rising again sometime next year.

6780 2018-11-05 13:16:55 Seems like Montagob supports Trumps so-called sanctions which are really just an attempt to steal Iran's oil - let's not forget Amerika organised a coup against a democratically elected government in Iran to impose the Shah as dictator who was overthrown by the people!  #wato

These are the six things that McDonald's taught me that break down fry oil.
6788 2018-11-05 13:16:26 This might help get some raw shea butter, some castor oil & coconut oil mix it together and keep and keep it one those old blixtex containers.

(Castor oil is thick so don't use much and you might not be fond of the smell you can add an essential oil)
6789 2018-11-05 13:16:09 Thank You! I did have to end up throwing the baklava away the next day. Baklava sans cooking oil = no longer a dessert.

6791 2018-11-05 13:15:36 Gotcha. There’s other options too: eggs, cottage cheese, protein shakes. I don’t like chicken myself and remember if you’re cutting carbs you can have more fat in your diet as well. (Nut butters, fatty cuts of meat, olive oil, pumpkin seeds..)
6792 2018-11-05 13:15:24 Sprinkle the leaves with sea salt and a little dry crushed chill and drizzle a little olive oil, dry out in the oven, quickly 180 degrees , carefull not to burn . Like chips addictive

6804 2018-11-05 13:14:21 Iran announced it will break sanctions and sell its oil. Time to dip into the oil stocks? DO or Marathon.
6805 2018-11-05 13:14:19 hello i love the smell of tea tree oil
6806 2018-11-05 13:14:18 #WhereIsTheOilMoney ? The oil money given to the  current government of Iran is being used for terrorist activities. It's time to stop that.
6807 2018-11-05 13:14:17 I always double cleanse with micellar water and a cleanser with a low concentration of salicylic acid. I moisturize once a day and for spot control I either use duac which was prescribed by my doctor or grease lightning from lush. AVOID COCONUT OIL AS A FACIAL MOISTURIZER it is

6811 2018-11-05 13:13:56 I beli kat shopee RM 36 tak silap. Dia kena pakai hydrating toner dulu, baru pakai exfoliating toner. I pakai Hadalabo hydrating toner, bagi dia meresap, pastu Somebymi miracle toner. Pastu dah resap pakai Alpha Arbutin-Niamicide-Moisturuser-Facial oil. Elok pakai malam la.

6821 2018-11-05 13:12:55 Patrick, I lived in Michigan for nine years. I met a few people who know Michael more personally. One of the nicest things they say about him is “snake oil salesman.” My late father-in-law, a GM worker and United auto worker, his opinion of Moore is unrepeatable.
6822 2018-11-05 13:12:47 We want overseas companies to drill for oil in hope yet we ignore real opportunities for renewable energy. We have vast stretches of barren land (even more since killing commercial farming). Why do we let our politicians do this? (Hint we don’t have a choice)

6828 2018-11-05 13:11:51 Doesn't even need to be in there! That's what pips me off as much as anything - so many products which never contained palm oil now do - not so much instead of anything but as well as. Grrrr

6832 2018-11-05 13:11:27 Iran President: Iran will "proudly derail" Trump's "illegal" sanctions by selling oil. Rouhani said US initiated "Economic War" on Iran.
He compared US president to former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.
Iran kicked off air defense exercises across a vast swathe of northern Iran.

6848 2018-11-05 13:09:56 I saw this & was intrigued but didn’t get it as I don’t have any plans for baking just yet. Like the fact it doesn’t contain palm oil. Interested to see what you think 
6849 2018-11-05 13:09:47 I think you are being dramatic. Capex is going higher because of input costs, and that's partially related to tariffs, partially normal inflation. Canada has more conventional wells and this isn't so much about decline rates but the fact that we need a higher oil price.

6855 2018-11-05 13:09:12 Is wel grappig. Steeds de Saudis het uithangen moet daar "met medewerking van US of europa" aan vast gekoppeld worden.
Dus als US of EU jets ergens gaan bombarderen moeten we daar ook "met medewerking van Saudi (oil)" aan toevoegen ?

6857 2018-11-05 13:09:04 The west also want to capture Syria, in order to stop Qatari oil & gas reaching Europe. As they push Iraqi pipeline thru it.

6888 2018-11-05 13:06:16 politics aside. i'm talking about thievery. the discovery of oil gives me both excitement and headache . being happy we found a solution t our energy problem ... and headache over the level of corruption that we having current. it is a fact that unless we reform .we wont benefit.

6891 2018-11-05 13:06:03 Makes more sense to get the cooking oil and sell it in zambia and malawi. Where can i get it? If someone is stupid enough to subsidise the product, we should make money of it!

6911 2018-11-05 13:04:37 Joel, you know as well as I that the museum is a simply a marketing tool for a mostly confected diet which serves the pasta and olive oil industries’ bottom line. It wasn’t erected by the locals as a lens into their dietary habits of over the last century.
6912 2018-11-05 13:04:33 ‘Strongest US sanctions ever’ targeting Iran’s oil go into effect… with ‘temporary’ concessions — RT Business News https:/       "Each sanction is an act of active weapon of war and is legally an International crime as per the United Nations international laws."
6913 2018-11-05 13:04:30 But India, among a select few countries, is getting a "free get out of jail" pass by allowing it to buy Iranian oil@ substantially below market price which in turn it can subsell @ market price making enormous profit to subsidies it's slowing economic growth & balance of payment

6920 2018-11-05 13:04:02 You are talking like the only way we can pay  lecturers and other sectors is through what they generate, what happen the money we get from crude oil? What happen to the enormous part of the budget that goes to the NASS ?

6926 2018-11-05 13:03:21 Maybe if Venezuela would have modernized their oil extraction system and not nationalize it, they might be doing better.  Largest reserves in the world don't do squat if you can't get to it.  Also diversify your economy to beat low oil prices.

6930 2018-11-05 13:03:12 Do you even know that subsidy is for your good and all Nigerians? Yes they have now captured it in the budget. Before the crude oil price increase there was no subsidy. The rise came as a surprise and so NNPC had to arrest it the situation so that Nigerians will not pay #175 .
6931 2018-11-05 13:03:11 He coulda at least said green oil

1. They are in fact berries - as are aubergines, lemons, grapes and tomatoes.
2. Have the highest protein and oil content of any fruit, and the fat they contain is mainly unsaturated.
6940 2018-11-05 13:02:15 I agree legalise the sale of it , tax it and regulate it . It would actually be good for the UK economy- would drive business Opertuinity, just like in the US ... comes with huge health benefits and is not just directed for recreational use. CBD oil

6943 2018-11-05 13:01:36 Brilliance? Or an unfair advantage of an unlimited investment by Arab oil money.
6944 2018-11-05 13:01:26 Yes, indeed, and we should remember that the Brits were quick to find and punish any Arab trying to harm the Iraqi oil pipeline in Haifa. Not so much re those who harmed/killed Jews. In 1938, the dream of permanent Brit control of Haifa was alive and well.

6970 2018-11-05 12:59:28 People forget that oil as far more uses than just energy production.

He saved $45B when oil price was down as against when it was higher $24B with PDP.He pays salary&pension,building infrastructure&U still call him incompetent.

7025 2018-11-05 12:54:44 Especially when it’s used to sop up some good olive oil
7026 2018-11-05 12:54:30 Monday’s you have nothing but people that pushes the oil to the outside and you have to play all the way right
7027 2018-11-05 12:54:20 Can't recall seeing #gas and #LNG feature so high up in so many oil/gas companies' results. Exxon, Total lining up with others to partner in Qatar LNG expansion. Momentum behind other projects (Mozambique, Papua, Arctic LNG, some US) but which will get over the line?
7028 2018-11-05 12:53:49 CBD oil , could help that , my wife uses it for endometriosis , perfectly legal and only a plant based extract.
7029 2018-11-05 12:53:16 Oil@@@@@@
7030 2018-11-05 12:53:02 Be careful when you guys light up oil lamps and candles at home during this joyous festive season ! Stay safe and have a blast !
7031 2018-11-05 12:52:57 Even after you bleach, just regularly use coconut oil until you feel like your hair is healthy enough...
7032 2018-11-05 12:52:47 yeah by the gallon because nothing makes SENSE here!!! We have big oil companies to thank who are destroying our earth and got Trump elected but hey, at least gas is cheap 
7033 2018-11-05 12:52:35 it might just be the dye drying it out. i suggest coconut oil masks every couple of days that you wash it. (leave it in your hair for 30 mins, then wash) and baby oil is a really good smoothing oil for after the shower. (more through the ends of wet hair, let dry)
7034 2018-11-05 12:52:33 It was a great idea.. the boost of oil for productivity gave the world lots of “wealth”.. but the sheriff its star is fading
7035 2018-11-05 12:52:31 Dono kr skte h... Powder se b aur permanent rkhna ho next Diwali tk to oil color..jese me krti hu

7037 2018-11-05 12:52:19 Spicy!
7038 2018-11-05 12:52:13 @baileysouthside @SouthsideSteve Steve how do you know that Regal Nissan went to Toyota and picked up an oil filter for your 4-Runner if they didn’t even tell you about it? #mindvudu #gripelist
7039 2018-11-05 12:52:12 Even before you go for the bleaching, just put a little oil on your hair at least few hours before so it has time to set it. The oil creates a layer so when the bleach interacts, it actually avoids heavy metals from damaging your hair even more...
7040 2018-11-05 12:52:12 I know and will believe in all of my heart at that water would belong to the Americas the only thing is it in it is how much gasoline and oil is in it as the color of water even looks different
7041 2018-11-05 12:52:06 Surprisingly Walter Magaya goes to court with 4 top lawyers Adv Thabani Mpofu, Admire Rubaya ,Everson Chatambudza, and Marwa.

Yet he was always telling his congregants kuti zora anointing oil kana uchienda ku court you will win the case.

7042 2018-11-05 12:51:51 I make a mixture in a small spray bottle of witch hazel, lavender oil, and peppermint oil. Spray your pillows with it an hour or so before bed. I have anxiety too and it helps me sleep all night.
7043 2018-11-05 12:51:51 Just watched. I luv my paRenTs.

7046 2018-11-05 12:51:27 The oil alone is about N800

7056 2018-11-05 12:50:35 Arab Oil will have to sell a few, seen as they’ve cheated Financial Fair Play.
7057 2018-11-05 12:50:15 OIL 1H volatility ON FULL now, but the level is "mild" here, not a lot of kick higher.
7058 2018-11-05 12:50:12 So does a snake oil salesman. But with Pres Trump he tells it like he sees it good bad and the ugly. I will take Pres Trump over snake oil salesman any day
7059 2018-11-05 12:50:10 No food aftrer 8 pm, skip breakfast, just drink black coffee with a spoonfull of butter or cocounut oil. Dijamin ga lapar sampe malem jam 4 sudah boleh makan lagi. Puasanya boleh minum air teh kopi asal no sugar
7060 2018-11-05 12:50:09 Most modern cars will indicate on dashboard if there is oil issue and a lot of cars are now sold without spare tyre...so I guess it has to be AA man.
7061 2018-11-05 12:50:06 @mrkiplingcakes Don’t you think it’s about time you stop using Palm Oil? I for one, won’t be buying any for my family until you change the recipe! #exceedinglydestructive #exceedinglyshameful
7062 2018-11-05 12:50:04 日本海グランプリーーー！
7063 2018-11-05 12:50:01 Moisturizer is must. Tapi untuk oily kena cari yang water based or yang oil free.
7064 2018-11-05 12:49:58 Usually what I do before and after I go for bleaching os regular coconut oul treatments. Like, massage your hair and scalp with oil and leave it for min 30 mins or overnight. The longer the better, then wash it. This strengthens the hair and protects the hair from bleach.
7065 2018-11-05 12:49:57 คนนี้เบอร์ตอง
7066 2018-11-05 12:49:54 We should not be surprised, Saddam was a target as soon as he announced Iraq's oil would be sold for Euros & not the PetroDollar.
7067 2018-11-05 12:49:52 Roads in the NCR should be watered before traffic allowed. Needs a large scale operation. Ban crackers/oil lamps. Implement odd even forthwith. Create air sprays using water bodies. Deploy air force aircraft in patterns to drop water from above haze height. Shut down power plants

7071 2018-11-05 12:49:13 Do you have an opinion or input re CBD oil for anxiety/insomnia? Just curious, been reading a lot about it. A therapist friend mentioned it.
7072 2018-11-05 12:49:09 オイルだからってオイルツイートばかりな訳じゃないぞ。油ツイートもするよ。
7073 2018-11-05 12:49:02 Till she dms you and tells you she's coming over. Now you this,oil soaked face photo taker with no water to bath looking for a bag of water to buy.
7074 2018-11-05 12:48:32 He is a Snake Oil Salesman who feeds into people's irrational fears.
7075 2018-11-05 12:48:28 Why not? Red Palm oil is one of the richest forms of vit A and vit E. In moderation is fine, the western world has brainwashed us into thinking many of our traditional foods are bad for us. In my opinion, its the opposite western food is not the best for Africans.
7076 2018-11-05 12:48:23 Zimbabwe discovers oil and gas deposits in its Northern region
7077 2018-11-05 12:48:23 It might just be the strain or the amount of your edible. Next time maybe try half.
It should just melt your pain and anxiety away.
When you eat the right edible, made from Indica oil in the evening, it will be a nice gentle relaxation!
7078 2018-11-05 12:48:23 Why are you so fond of repeating cheap &tired propaganda lines? Whatever you are saying does not erase the fact that Zim now has a huge oil prospect that will change your life & mine. Be positive for once!
7079 2018-11-05 12:48:17 National institute of clinical evidence and other Individuals with massive personal vested interest in how and what Oil is used and approved. do you know what CBD Oil the NHS are prescribing for example? who got that contract?

7082 2018-11-05 12:47:59 Phrased better, you could have asked, "what can I export to China?" Here are some products highly demanded by China:
Cereals, sugar, live animals, dairy products, eggs, leather & leather products, coffee, tea, spices, fruits, nuts, oil seeds, vegetables,honey, wool, cotton...etc

7085 2018-11-05 12:47:43 Put some essential oil of your choice in there too for some pleasing aromas. (I've been in Pinterest a lot recently.)

7090 2018-11-05 12:47:17 Ill repeat myself. He brought up the big bad bogeyman of BigOil. I was. pointongnoutvthat bigoil is only bigoil because we as consumers demand their products and pay for them. If we stopped consuming, big oil wouldn't exist.But we enjoy the benefits of modern lifestyle too much
7091 2018-11-05 12:47:15 A question to common man (wrong place to ask but still) where is your view for #2019Elections. Will you allow hijacking of your issues water, pollution, education, roads, infrastructure, employment, farm, agrarian crisis, oil prices etc by sentimental and religious ones.
7092 2018-11-05 12:47:11 It’s because his hair is so greasy. Water and oil don’t mix. :|

...but then, you’d think it would be /easier/ for him to swim...

Balls. Hell if I know. XD
7093 2018-11-05 12:47:11 The reason eternal places like hell or limbo seem unimaginable, is because it is not compatible with the man-centered, counterfeit "Catholicism" you've been given, mixed together with some true Catholics beliefs. Modernism and Catholicism, like oil and water, don't mix.
7094 2018-11-05 12:47:10 Chef Skinner cut up some bars of soap, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was an old shoe brush, along with gravy.
7095 2018-11-05 12:47:08 How many miles can a car go when it had 0 oil left ? I just needa go to school and bike 
7096 2018-11-05 12:47:02 My preference is to sear the chicken on all sides first, so yes, brown them in a little oil first x
7097 2018-11-05 12:46:48 @SyamiraIbrahim ada lagi tak cleansing oil tu naakkkk 
7098 2018-11-05 12:46:44 So that your country can fight the rest of the world! For oil! And natural resources! It would have been so much more decent if they had attacked us first.
7099 2018-11-05 12:46:28 And oil. Don’t forget the oil!

7102 2018-11-05 12:45:33 I wonder if all the clubs who have sold players to City and received money from such a deplorable club with its filthy oil money like to hand it to UEFA to clear their consciences ?

7104 2018-11-05 12:45:25 COSMOPOLITAN: Put your essential oil into their snootch
7105 2018-11-05 12:45:23 Well she sounds very smart. She should apply to a big oil company. Companies like @Shell or @exxonmobil love young smart ladies to join their workforce. And believe me, they take very good care of their people.

7108 2018-11-05 12:45:21 Sit down adhal. What more verification do you need when an independent evaluator has confirmed the potential oil prospects. Next time don't try to be relevant when you are not. It's cheap!
7109 2018-11-05 12:45:09 How true is it that oil paint makes a room hotter please?

7115 2018-11-05 12:44:12 Pisces. We've articulated our plan in presso and anns right from the start. Add value through our technical work, de-risk, then farmout. In Cape Town for Africa Oil Week.

7121 2018-11-05 12:43:54 It had nothing to do with Saddam being a nasty dictator treating people badly, this was about Oil as Dick Cheney admitted.

7162 2018-11-05 12:40:38 How the heck has the U.K. pension got anything to do with EU membership? Maybe if the Thatcher government has invested North Sea oil revenues properly instead of pissing them away on reducing PSBR we might be in a better position.

7185 2018-11-05 12:39:01 Gyspies ! Snake Oil ! & Circus!
7186 2018-11-05 12:38:47 The sanctions on Iran may ratchet down the influence of US with world economy. The quintessence of dollar based system is the linkage of dollar with crude oil trade（＠ｗぷ
7187 2018-11-05 12:38:42 and when you can process your own oil iss more cost effective 
7188 2018-11-05 12:38:42 Bros you used eggs to fry oil from what I can see... You're not ready IMO.... 
7189 2018-11-05 12:38:37 PresidentTrump must speak with President Rouhani and finish with an unnecessary  u Lear agreement pending issue. In particular, after Saudi Arabia’s failure and menaces to the US relate to oil supplies.

7193 2018-11-05 12:38:21 Mike buck stated in July lse interview partners willing to pay more if wild horse strikes oil. So got partners waiting for results.

I don't know anything about  mysq  or the other company you mentioned.
7194 2018-11-05 12:38:08 No it won’t because it promotes energy to put gas and oil in your car and it’s good for the economy and it promotes jobs
7195 2018-11-05 12:38:00 The oil crises was not labour's fault and the IMF loan was not needed. Labour again, under pressure by the neolibral narrative of balancing the books and trying to maintain the value of £ against $ even though £ was fiat by then.

7201 2018-11-05 12:37:30 The list would probably be just as long if not for oil money ...
7202 2018-11-05 12:37:11 US imposed the toughest sanctions on Iran, however Iran intends to eschew it by avoiding dollar transactions. This may trigger collapse of dollar based system. Actually the linkage of dollar with crude oil is nosediving these days（＠ｗぷ

7241 2018-11-05 12:32:47  Um..."recipe" the ratio is 1:4  so I usually boil 2 cups water+ a splash of olive oil or butter + salt then add your 1/2 cup grits, stir, turn to lowest setting, cover, and be patient until they've soaked up the water and are soft. Serve with more butter because heart disease.

And above all gt him 2 believers I've seen many cancers and many things healed.
7246 2018-11-05 12:32:16 I personally support the bundling. the retailers are bundling so as to avoid hoarding by people. The producers have failed to flood the market with cooking oil, so the retailers came up with this idea. At least taakutomboiwana mumashops acho ne$3.99. Its better than buying it $7

7273 2018-11-05 12:28:34 In the oil companies defense if they had been allowed to drill closer to shore they could have capped the well with normal diving equipment in a couple of hours instead of 87 days.

7288 2018-11-05 12:27:18 Just reading the article that @psy_historian (thanks, James) sent me and it quotes Speer saying (in Jan 1945) that RAF night attacks against oil plants were more accurate than USAAF day operations. Similar aiming challenges for power stations? @BuddNicholas

7291 2018-11-05 12:26:58 First, he looks amazing! Well done so far Second, I would definitely give him some shading. The shading will give some definition to the red as it has a bit of a flat look to it. I would definitely suggest Carroburgh Crimson and Druchii Violet (maybe some Nuln Oil as well)

7303 2018-11-05 12:25:42 Fyi, these sanctions are toothless and just for show. The US gave to many countries an exemption for Iranian oil. Therefore Iran isnt under any pressure. Status quo stays the same.
7304 2018-11-05 12:25:39 @realDonaldTrump That is, these eight countries will never be able to pay Iran's oil money, just medicine and food. If implemented in this way, the maximum pressure will be implemented a bit, otherwise it will not be different from the 2012 sanctions.
7305 2018-11-05 12:25:36 No, no tuvo que ver que en 1910 en EU le quitaran el monopolio de Standard Oil a Rockefeller para que en México iniciara la Revolución... ¿quien dijo?..

7308 2018-11-05 12:25:20 Ending the Nuclear Treaty is a very bad idea - Not sure why Republicans defend this ? Doesn't make much sense.
Most don't even know that the sanctions on IRAN are fake and Tump gave waivers to MANY countries who buy Iranian Oil - Bolton was so mad he took a fit about the Waivers

7319 2018-11-05 12:23:45 I’ve noticed I have very realistic dreams since I’ve been using the CBD oil. I’m assuming it’s because it puts you into the deeper rapid-eye-movement state.

7322 2018-11-05 12:23:32 It's also called the military-industrial-congressional complex. A lot of money flows in America because of military spending. Corporate tax take is huge. Employment and income tax too.  And intervening in other countries often has a benefit to the US e.g. with access to oil. But
7323 2018-11-05 12:23:13 Outstanding job @President Donald J Trump & Secretary of treasury Steven Mnuchin on a successfully renegotiated trade deal USMCA and a strong stance on free and fair trade, China now backs down on the 25% tarrif on oilCongratulations.
7324 2018-11-05 12:23:08 Once you are paid for what you deliver the ownership passes to the buyer. Whatever happens later should not be a source of your problem/s. If I buy cooking oil from a supermarket I don't expect them to tell me what to cook or fry and when to do it.

7354 2018-11-05 12:18:43 I think that per capita has nothing to do with it. As population increases, CDN emission pollution will increase. The reason that per cap emission is high is that we are export nation. 70% grains oilseeds pulses = C exported from Canada. Same with wood, oil, coal.#cleanairwater

7374 2018-11-05 12:15:52 many americans make the case today that the us isnt motivated by oil abroad as they have enough themselves. this is a misinterpretation of the intent of the us the us isnt trying to controll oil for the destabilisation of oil so us oil becomes financially viable or to hurt russia

7423 2018-11-05 12:08:37 You already get your geographic share of oil revenues, such as they now are. Funny, how Salmond promised that oil wealth would make us all rich in 2014. Just one of his many lies.

7434 2018-11-05 12:07:36 Actually, Scotland gets its geographic share of oil revenues. From what nationalists say, it seems they think they should also get the revenues that are geographic to the rest of the UK.
7435 2018-11-05 12:07:21 I’m literally so upset right now please don’t start mining the ocean..
The companies who have been fracking in England to find oil have caused 17 earthquakes in the country within one week already..

7442 2018-11-05 12:06:53 No need to get nasty. And yes Venezuela is number 1 in oil reserves. They're number 10 in production and dropping because of the policies Shan is trying to force on Canadians that we can't afford. Let me know what I've said that's a probable lie. Waiting

7449 2018-11-05 12:06:30 The oil (if cultivated via CO2 extraction) should be more potent..I think I've said too much..I mean, i dunno
7450 2018-11-05 12:06:27 And big oil's pals.  I am constantly amazed that centuries of marginalization, institutional oppression and cultural genocide haven't led to more cases of Indigenous leaders crumbling under the onslaught.  The Trudeau Government should be ashamed of itself, but isn't.

7468 2018-11-05 12:03:37 How? Easy. With oil at $100 they couldn’t save, built no infrastructure, borrowed to pay salaries, at $50,their profligacy would have destroyed d nation. They were spending more than we made, reason the national reserve was depleted, ECA depleted. The economy was in trouble.

7485 2018-11-05 12:01:40 It could be I don’t know enough about it. All I know is, taking all of the stored carbon out of the ground and pumping it neat into the atmosphere in a very short space of time is very risky. Also stopping oil and gas use over night is also catastrophic.

7512 2018-11-05 11:57:42 Due to the unresolved local currency issue your cooking oil is now extremely cheap. You are selling it to the retailers at around 60 cents per litre in real USD terms. The net effect is that retailers are now exporting it for real USD which they will sell on the black market
7513 2018-11-05 11:57:40 Always towards the end. Like that’s always the last step in my house at least. We’ll cook the soup and everything then add the red oil last and let it simmer for a bit then dish it out.

7515 2018-11-05 11:57:33 yeah.. Removal of fuel subsidy makes no sense if we are still paying for the fuel we use to run our economy to be refined. They should fix our refineries first, that's why when we'll start receiving the right dividends of being an oil producing state

7562 2018-11-05 11:51:46 All good Hindus must resist the Chinese cultural aggression from the ages that is fireworks and use the pure Indian form of oil lamps to ward off darkness and evil.
7563 2018-11-05 11:51:46 The thing I liked most about Trump’s campaign was he sounded like he was going to put an end to this. Truth is we should be partners with Russia and Iran in rolling back Radical Islam.  And I don’t buy the story Iraq was about oil.  
And at this point Saudi isn’t about oil either

7674 2018-11-05 11:37:52 Faux et archi faux. D'abord le salaire d'un député n'est pas le bon. Au Portugal par exemple le gas oil est bien plus cher qu'en France et les portugais gagnent bien moins. Seulement eux ils sont courageux. Les insouminables préfèrent piquer les aides même avec un salaire de D.

7728 2018-11-05 11:30:42 Chavez nationalizes the oil sector when he got in power, right? It was controlled previously by the fossil fuels mega-corporation. I think capital didn't likey that their control of the world's energy was reduced by a national populist. Just national redistribution in one sector.
7729 2018-11-05 11:30:34 Is disgusted by trumps monumental stupidity. But that's beside the point, an ex oil CEO was an influential member of the white house,  yet big solar is your boogie man. You must have weird nightmares.

Emotion felt by some football supporters when they realise the oil in their cars is never going to filter into the club they support and long for an Arabian billionaire to come along with an investment.
Not to be confused with jealousy.

7793 2018-11-05 11:22:46 The powers that be, I.e., the oil companies, are throwing us a 5¢ bone to make it look like prices are going down before the election. Which is bs, because if prices weren't fixed, we would find gas stations still making profits and charging half the price.

7811 2018-11-05 11:19:06 That oil is scary though....
7812 2018-11-05 11:19:02 Yeah I think in some areas politicians in this country are so cautious, look how slowly cannabis oil legalisation happened here compared to the US and Canada who are about a decade ahead of us 
7813 2018-11-05 11:18:59 How many women are employed as workers in those oil rigs you've worked at?
7814 2018-11-05 11:18:50 Gas is the future. What do you think made Qatar the richest country on the planet? With the UK banning fuel powered cars in 2032, and others at an advanced stage, the future of oil is not as good. Gas will always have a market.
7815 2018-11-05 11:18:37 What of if we do not have oil again the same way you guys finished the treasury the other time and the country went into recession.why must we spend every Kobo we made and this is one of our senator.Lord safe us from us this hawks

7858 2018-11-05 11:14:24 Well it's actually not really socialist, just had a nationalization of the oil sector and some redistribution. Just a factual thing. More like a populist leader with some socialist-leaning policies. Still too much for the capitalist class though.

Her feet go down to death;
her steps lead straight to the grave."

8028 2018-11-05 10:55:58 They don't have to be politicians. They only have to be connected to politicians e.g many who were alloted oil wells aren't politicians but they still are huge beneficiaries of corruption.

8205 2018-11-05 10:24:00 The UK economy is changing every hour of every day for a multitude of reasons, we survived the global banking crash, we survive various stock market crashes, we survived the crash in oil prices so I'm pretty sure our economy will survive brexit.

8218 2018-11-05 10:22:11 US unilaterally re-imposes sanctions on Iran today - only Chinese importers, some limited Indian buyers, and a negligible level of Turkish demand will remain - this will leave Iran's oil exports at just 1.2m barrels/day in 2019, down from 2017 average of 2.5m b/d

8263 2018-11-05 10:15:24 That doesn't sound like a big find to me. 181 million barrels of oil at $70/barrel equals only $12B. Angola produces 1,5 million barrels of oil per day which means they wd exhaust our oil in less than half a year if they came mining it at that rate
8264 2018-11-05 10:15:11 well is that such a surprise? Saudi should be on a warning But weak kneed politicians, arms manufacturers & oil companies will shudder at the thought and more heads in the sand will prevail

8281 2018-11-05 10:12:53 US oil prices plunged to below $63.00 a barrel,down over 18% from its peak a month earlier-largely due to fears of a slowing global growth & therefore crude demand.

This gives a reason for a biological/chemical effect. Reason implies intent. Could not be more wrong.

Human skin prunes when sebum oil erodes in the presence of water. There is no reason for this. It is what happens when sebum and water meet.

8336 2018-11-05 10:04:31 Oil price slide looks a bit odd now with Iran/Venezuela concerns, but w/wiggle room around sanctions for some of the biggest importers, and still strong supply (US production hit >11m bpd!) it makes a bit more sense. #OOTT #IranSanctions

8344 2018-11-05 10:03:38 How come that American money, built on the back of the raping and pillaging of Middle eastern oil is ok but middle eastern money, in the hands of middle eastern people isn't?

Do you not like black people?
8345 2018-11-05 10:03:35 Probably, but the truth is we should be having a much bigger budget than that for a country of our population. But where will the money come from with this our obsession with oil?
8346 2018-11-05 10:03:19 Trump is killing our jobs & hurting our lower class. Working people suffer from his lack of lack of knowledge. Coal and oil is the perfect example of his stupidity. Why are we investing in the past, when everyone knows the future is clean & renewable energy. Do you agree?

8355 2018-11-05 10:01:36 DID YOU KNOW?

Jelly doughnuts have fewer calories and less fat than a plain sugared ring doughnut. While a ring doughnut might weigh less, it has a greater surface area exposed to the oil and so absorbs more of the oil than a round one.
8356 2018-11-05 10:01:19 Guinea-Bissau and Senegal made good early progress in talks to revise the agreement sharing out potential oil and gas revenue from their joint offshore exploration zone. But with both governments under domestic pressure, a scheduled negotiating round in late August was postponed.

8373 2018-11-05 09:58:52 I know some water/oil chemistry... other than oil being less dense than H2O (so it floats), it's non polar- doesn't dissolve in H2O which is polar. Oil dissolves in a nonpolar liquids like turpentine. Soap can clean oil bc it has both polar/ nonpolar properties. 
Enough for now

8378 2018-11-05 09:57:59 And that generates allowances to set against tax, which is partly why tax receipts from oil are so low. The other reason is that Swinney begged Osborne to slash tax on oil companies, when prices plummeted. Osborne obliged.

In d midst of wealth, when crude oil was $130pb, d PDP govt distributed poverty & misery.They drained NGR’s foreign reserves & rapaciously shared d money.They emptied monies in Excess Crude Account&Sovereign Wealth Fund

8621 2018-11-05 09:25:18 As US oil sanctions r reimposed, #Iran’s economic outlook looks bleak -  @TheEIU estimates nearly 5% GDP contraction in 2018, nrly 4% shrinkage in 2019, stagnation in 2020. Rial depreciation pushing inflation above 30%. Rouhani authority w weaken further, hardliners to benefit.

8626 2018-11-05 09:24:26 I understand their frustrations though, they have other goods to move, but you will find their shops full of people just wanting cooking oil and in some cases for resale. I once saw kombis emptying people at PicknPay, that's not normal

8635 2018-11-05 09:22:19 Well thankfully those new sanctions are about to rock Iran where it hurts. We're in a weird spot w/ China-needing them to cut their oil purchases, but not working w/ them on other things. We need to bring more countries into our SOI and prevent cheaters/enablers

I made coconut oil in my sous vide. 
I saved the trim and I put a small piece  under my tongue (sublingual is a fast way of absorbing cannabis) and I felt straight away that it still was quite potent, how do I extract more from the trim?

8766 2018-11-05 09:01:36 As a #stroke survivor myself, Pat, I'd note that there's a point here about the extent we are encouraged to define ourselves by work – and a particular work hard, burn the midnight oil, type of work – that's very unhealthy. Life-threatening, in my case. (1/2)
8767 2018-11-05 09:01:34 so the point of the sanctions are what, exactly?  If you allow such large countries as China and India to still buy iranian oil, is Iran really being hurt?

8792 2018-11-05 08:56:22 I think the normal situation is that if one wants cooking oil they should be able to buy without being forced to buy other things they don't need. Retailers are now using this commodity to push their sales.
8793 2018-11-05 08:56:16 I was against Saudi oil wars then too, but the absolutely psychotic love of oil wars and a new arms race is 50 yards past the line of decency and sanity as we plan our future.

8806 2018-11-05 08:53:48 Oil Prices fell as the start to U.S. sanctions against Iran's fuel exports was softened by waivers that will allow major buyers to still import Iranian crude, at least temporarily.

8884 2018-11-05 08:38:30 Monday Morning = £ up against $, Oil price down .5%, and the supermarkets still refusing to lower prices? @sainsburys @Tesco @Morrisons @asda ...oil price has dropped about 20% in last month and nothing has happened?? @TheSun
8885 2018-11-05 08:38:29 U.S. government said on Friday it will temporarily allow several countries including South Korea and Turkey to keep importing #Iranian #oil when U.S. sanctions come back into force on Monday, sparing them for now from the threat of U.S. economic penalties.

8887 2018-11-05 08:38:15 i'm gonna take your tweet because you know a thing or two about oil and gas.
8888 2018-11-05 08:37:51 Thing is. The Kwitters cannot even muster a fart between them let alone a 1922 committee led challenge to "take back control" from the Maybot and deliver the snake oil they DUPed you with.

The rest of us are laughing. Right across Europe and beyond. All with smug faces.

8895 2018-11-05 08:37:15 I agree with you completely! We've lost all of that and more, i'd say we're not heading in the right direction at all! One of our biggest loses under Trump is def clean and renewable energy. We should be investing in wind,water, solar, cobalt and get our economy away from oil!

8906 2018-11-05 08:36:06 English lady visited my studio, now living in southern Spain. Conservationist. So annoyed that from her window she watches the fishing boats land boxes of protected fry, millions of them, totally illegal. They're fried up with olive oil & lemon juice in the local restaurants.
8907 2018-11-05 08:35:58 My colleague also complained how he has nearly stopped eating some sabzi because it's like sabzi floating in oil
8908 2018-11-05 08:35:50 Aye laddie, we're not called Rip Off Britain for nothing. Just look at the graph for pensions in the UK. Oil was discovered under the North Sea off the shores of Scotland and not only was Scotland ripped off, Britain ripped off the whole of the UK.

8924 2018-11-05 08:32:24 yes! make sure you try to switch between other ranges like DOY to help w scarring + hydration; that way your skin doesn’t get use to just TT oil, sometimes it can stop being as effective. little tip

8944 2018-11-05 08:28:05 It's not just about the oil, isn't it? It's about the passage which US can go through and other business vessels can go through this place, or you will be suffered from a long sea way to avoid being pushed, it's not economic.

8947 2018-11-05 08:27:48 No disagreements there whatsoever. It's going to become even more pressing as oil market volatility increases in the coming years, so state spending will strain to drive growth without giving up on Russia's debt avoidance obsession.

8957 2018-11-05 08:24:52 Wouldn’t lower oil prices encourage productivity and lower input costs which would therefore be positive to earnings?  Unless your talking about global demand for goods and services?
8958 2018-11-05 08:24:50 I know. If oil keeps going down everything changes(If oil drops my puts will do fine. ) It was more of a comment from price action perspective and how participants moved Transocean last week. Traders get trapped so easily

We need to prioritize the Energy East pipeline and if you want to protect the oceans I’m on board. We can stop shipping IN Saudi oil.

9136 2018-11-05 07:55:34 US sanctions on #Iran come into force covering Iran's banking/energy sectors &reinstating penalties for countries/companies in Europe, Asia &elsewhere that don't halt Iranian oil imports.But #USA  dodges questions on commitment from #India #China on zero-oil purchase from Iran.

9139 2018-11-05 07:55:10 It's all temporary mate. Watch it happen in your lifetime. Westerners are no longer as dumb that they can't differentiate Muslims from rest. In fact, there is increasing awareness now against Muslims. 
Oil isn't forever... See the conflict already?
9140 2018-11-05 07:55:00 Switching to oil is an interesting move. To my eyes they're not elegant but just the complete outrageous nature of its engineering has a beauty all of its own.
9141 2018-11-05 07:54:56 I wonder if Petro Can uses Saudi Arabia oil to refine into Petro Can gas? How impossible would it be to stop the global warming farce then?
9142 2018-11-05 07:54:33 The second package of US sanctions on Iran comes into force, this time it includes oil and banking sectors. All foreign countries or entities are prevented from entering the US market if they decide to proceed with the purchase of Iranian oil or continue dealing with their banks.
9143 2018-11-05 07:54:31 Oil chafuuuuuuuuuu
9144 2018-11-05 07:54:21 You're Native American and you vote for the party that wants to disenfranchise your people? That wants to give up your land to the oil companies? That wants you to be non-existent? Good vote.

9147 2018-11-05 07:53:57 I want to die whenever i see the amt of oil my uncle cooks with u dont even fucking. need any and he literally fills the pan yuck
9148 2018-11-05 07:53:49 Russia overtook Saudi Arabia as an oil supplier to China, got the first place
9149 2018-11-05 07:53:46 Oil purchased by earlier govt. During sanctions we paid thrice the cost later that's the difference

9154 2018-11-05 07:52:37 Don't sell them ,exchange oil with goods from China and all over the world.

9172 2018-11-05 07:50:04 I think most of the voters are EU people and consider their advantages. Because they can take advantage of having a relationship with Iran's corrupted regime. Cheaper oil, selling their products in Iran as a great opportunity of them. Surely they support Iran's regime.
9173 2018-11-05 07:50:02 You are trying to explain to someone who’s fundamental view of Nigeria’s wealth is wrong. This isn’t going anywhere. Until people accept that Nigeria is neither rich nor oil rich, they won’t accept the realities on ground

Instead of post-oil go w/ “more than oil.” Just liberalize private industry regs & let it grow

9235 2018-11-05 07:42:50 Iran will “proudly break the unjust sanctions,” President Hassan Rouhani said Monday, the day the second round of US sanctions hits the country’s oil industry.
9236 2018-11-05 07:42:08 1 litre = 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm = 1000 cm^3 . Density of oil is less than that of water that's why oil floats in the water. 1 kg oil = (1/0.9) litre = 1.1 litre . So a hundred ml should still be around 100grams if weighed. 

You were laughing him off for weighing oil. Olodo!

9254 2018-11-05 07:40:08 China, the world’s largest importer of Iranian oil, is also likely to get an exemption as Washington tries to avoid further antagonizing Beijing with sanctions amid an already heated trade war.

9259 2018-11-05 07:39:36 This solves the conundrum of higher oil prices and crashing equities: despite higher cash flow from existing production, capex for new production surges even higher due to exorbitant decline rates. This gets worse by the day and is also true for Canadian companies.

9261 2018-11-05 07:38:52 I aims that you take your passion for fighting climate and think of practical solutions. Fighting pipelines has meant oil billionaires like the Koch’s are laughing at you for letting them to take as much oil as they can out of our country and put the $$$ in the U.S.

9267 2018-11-05 07:37:39 I fully support the HCS approach. However: Increased demand for palm oil is currently driving deforestation, even if a company buys #deforestationfree, due to indirect land use change. Thus; as long as the palm oil industry is deforesting, avoiding increased demand is essential.

9273 2018-11-05 07:36:01 I'm talking about US foreign policy driven by the Right-wing military industrial complex, that has been profiting off foreign oil wars and supporting SAUDI TERRORISM since before WW2, while simpleminded fools like you preach holy wars to the terrified masses.

9281 2018-11-05 07:34:53 Did you know that oil now sells for about $70 per barrel?

There was a time when it was $35, they wouldn't let us hear enough of it.

Now it has doubled, they won't tell you!

9342 2018-11-05 07:25:17 So as I have been saying. Focusing on absorbing the carbon makes more sense. Doing so will build the economy. Going after oil is ridiculous, we rely on the energy, we need to not be giving our oil away at $16/bbl as fast as we can, we need to charge $50/bbl in taxes and invest

9357 2018-11-05 07:22:12 Why should an increase in world oil production create shortages in Venezuela? Clearly capitalism fails to allocate resources efficiently. Vz should encourage farming on public land. But shortages are a direct result of money markets. Give Vz individuals dollars, and shortages end
9358 2018-11-05 07:22:07 US imposes ‘toughest ever’ sanctions on Iran.

Saudi Arabia is the only countr­y with the capaci­ty to make up for lost Irania­n oil produc­tion
9359 2018-11-05 07:22:01 i swear i've tried every cleanser/scrub under the sun and it's always just been russian roulette, or the lesser of evils... :/  for moisturizer tho, i use oil of olay for sensitive skin. the cheap one, like $10-11 at Target. works p great for me
9360 2018-11-05 07:21:58 try selling your oil to another country using any other currency besides the us dollar and see what happens  sadaam & gadaffi tried lol....the only way you can pull that off is to work with a country the us cant dominate so easily without severe consequences ;p
9361 2018-11-05 07:21:53 All one has to do is study the history of the Middle East, and what Russia's role has been there, to see why it's important to play nice with them, to a certain extent. Trump flat out told Germany to stop getting their oil from Russia, and has placed strong sanctions on Russia.
9362 2018-11-05 07:21:50 Happy New Week, coconut oil is overrated. Get tea tree oil into your life
9363 2018-11-05 07:21:47 Lower prices for oil and nat. gas are unalloyed goods for the poorest among us. A $10 change in the price of a barrel of oil has a vastly greater impact on a poor family than a 10 part/million change in CO2 concentration.
9364 2018-11-05 07:21:37 Mass protests broke out in Tehran after a fresh round of US sanctions hit Iran today. However, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has said that Iran will break sanctions and continue to sell oil as usual.
9365 2018-11-05 07:21:21 Strange that the minister of mineral affairs was involved in selling our oil reserves @ US$ 29 per barrel when the oil price was more than double that.

9402 2018-11-05 07:14:08 @narendramodi ji India is not in a position to reduce crude oil import but we can affort a sizeable cut on precious stone, gold, silver etc which is the 2nd largest import, this can relieve the economic presssure to some extent. @arunjaitley

9404 2018-11-05 07:13:38 But the problem with sanction is the difficulty of selling Iran its OIL, because any buyer will be punished by the chance of loosing US trade, The bigger beneficiary here will be China who is on trade war with US already.

9486 2018-11-05 06:53:57 That was my interpretation. Traders don’t want to be long if economies slowing. But Iran export been doubling since Feb-2016 when sanctions were lifted. Iran export is more significant than slowing demand. I guess there are buyers for Iranian oil even though  sanctions are back.

9542 2018-11-05 06:44:28 Iranian President @HassanRouhani remains defiant as U.S. sanctions snap back. He said on state TV that his country would continue to sell oil despite the sanctions aimed at crippling the Iranian economy.

9545 2018-11-05 06:43:44 Mr baby oil Gigaba. Please save yourself the embarrassment of facing the media and the courts , we all know what you did and in some cases witnessed your stroke ability Sies man.
9546 2018-11-05 06:43:44 It's the plant sterols rather than the unsat fat. Fish doesn't contain plant sterols. Nuts do. I don't see a problem with any real food. If we ate sunflower seeds (for vit E) that would be fine - sunflower oil is unnaturally high in plant sterols.
9547 2018-11-05 06:43:35 Lmao I use @SophieTheMua’s black soap and body oil .
9548 2018-11-05 06:43:35 So... The fact that the US told some other country you can't sell your own oil is crazy!
9549 2018-11-05 06:43:18 we have to question why Syria is being targeted?

Syria is sitting on a lot of oil Golan heights?

it's neighbor is Israel, which is intent on expanding its borders?

it does not have a central bank?

it is geographically strategically positioned?

USA still actively involved?
9550 2018-11-05 06:43:03 #Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says #Iran will sell its oil and break sanctions reimposed by U.S. - via @Reuters
9551 2018-11-05 06:42:51 How are you feeling otherwise?

Also, coconut oil, let it sit for like, ever, then gently scrub off. That's how I got my crap off.
9552 2018-11-05 06:42:13 what gives the US the right to decide whether a country can sell oil or not, and to which countries they can?
9553 2018-11-05 06:41:54 Wow, 80 year old propaganda against #hemp that even the @GOP is trying to ignore? Good example of you two faced liars protecting Saudi oil instead of #USFarmers. Try focusing on reality instead of paranoid delusions.

9554 2018-11-05 06:41:52 I literally use garlic olive oil in every single thing I make. it’s so good 
9555 2018-11-05 06:41:47 This is enough to supply us oil our oil needs for 20 years....I think its enough but will ask the experts

The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, Sunday, insisted that there is no impending petroleum products scarcity in the country, arising from the threat of strike action by the Nigerian Labour Congress, NLC.
9558 2018-11-05 06:41:22 America needs to do more, and so do the Muslim countries who have an interest since this is happening to Uigher Muslims (mostly) and China depends on them for oil. I agree though, the US needs to step up and do more to challenge Chinese behavior across the board
9559 2018-11-05 06:41:20 Try to find a solution for the poverty in your country better than buying Iranian oil.
9560 2018-11-05 06:41:15 For the first time in three years, my skin isn't peeling off my face like pappadam and I want to thank the gods of coconut oil for finally coming through for me in this dry-ass climate

9577 2018-11-05 06:39:17 Anika I've been aware of your journey and am a third generation farmer just east of you. But I think the focus is misplaced. Rainforests to the north of us are being decimated for coffee and palm oil. We are in an interglacial period which means warming. Europe will thrive - us?
9578 2018-11-05 06:39:13 yeah ive used amla oil before (just to fix split ends) and it was rly nice! no idea where i can find shikakai and neem oil in south africa lol but if i find them ill try it!

9584 2018-11-05 06:38:45 The #US reimposes oil and financial sanctions against #Iran, significantly turning up the pressure on Tehran in order to curb its missile and nuclear programs and counter its growing military and political influence in the Middle East.
9585 2018-11-05 06:38:44 Omg. Slow news day or what? I hope you don't use gasoline in your car (or oil) because YOU think "we're" homophobic??  Have you ever been to the middle east?  Women JUST got the "right" to drive in Saudi Arabia for shit sake!

9588 2018-11-05 06:38:25 It's alright and understandable. SP No. 18 was brought to the D&SNG as part of an oil training plan in order to prepare the railroad for oil burning locomotives such as 493.

9596 2018-11-05 06:37:16 The Soviet Union lived and died on oil exports. When the price of oil fell in the 1980s. The Soviets could no longer buy enough food imports.
9597 2018-11-05 06:37:09 We know the Saudis are a bunch of low-intelligent people, whose oil is the only reason why they are a "state". Yet, the US has a moral responsibility for not selling weapons to stupid users. You have blood on your hands!
9598 2018-11-05 06:36:21 You talk like the US is the one that buys Iranian oilEU said they will continue with buying Iranian oil!Russia offered to refine it.
9599 2018-11-05 06:36:08 Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says Iran will sell its oil and break sanctions reimposed by U.S. - Reuters
9600 2018-11-05 06:36:02 8 countries got waivers to buy Iran’s oil..Japan S Korea India ...all Asian countries asked for waivers coz they’re close to Iran geographically....هيدي العقوبات لح تأخرهم ٢٠ سنة وبس بالتكنولوجيا ...بس بتمرق. انشالله
9601 2018-11-05 06:36:00 my dad handing me an oil pen is definitely the wildest thing that's happened so far
9602 2018-11-05 06:35:53 Maybe if lawmakers like you champion the abolition of your over bloated allowance, there would be enough money to go round. Crude oil prices fluctuates, using it as a benchmark for salary increase is ingenious.
9603 2018-11-05 06:35:47 Oil prices are jacked up by Modi because he took Chanda from oil companies for Sardar patel statue as reported in various newspapers.
statue shucked the blood of commoners.
9604 2018-11-05 06:35:33 Any company or country in world will know what happens if they buy Iran's oil

9613 2018-11-05 06:34:56 @DemiZiwewera I think this is a good research, however, I think we need to realize that just because the company might not have huge capital to pour into Zim in the case of an oil discovery does not mean they do not have connections with the Capex
9614 2018-11-05 06:34:52 wait o is that oil
9615 2018-11-05 06:34:48 The reason behind it is that Trump wants that privileged idiots like you have the luxury to spread nonsense in the internet the whole day.

If it weren't for the oil the would be irrelevant and he just nuked them.

9619 2018-11-05 06:34:20 No, you're thinking of K-37 No. 493, which is being repaired to oil fired.

I mean, that was a really big explosion. Maybe there was no oxygen.
9628 2018-11-05 06:33:13 Iran will sell its oil to China and Russia, busting US sanctions. Any oil-related defiance of this kind would usually bring a barrage of American missiles slamming into hospitals, schools and apartment blocks.

9633 2018-11-05 06:32:28 So if it comes down to cheap fuel - surely Nigeria and Angola who have lots of oil can replicate the model. Emirates airline gets lots of government support. It will go bust without government support.
9634 2018-11-05 06:32:25 Also conservatives are the only ones to say it is patriotic to have 9/11 happen and instead of going after the people that claimed responsibility for it went after Iraq which just happened to have a ton of oil..Obama had to go in and get the real culprit with ST6
9635 2018-11-05 06:32:21 The question is, who will defy Trump & buy Iran's oil. It'll cost them lost America business.

9642 2018-11-05 06:31:26 ...and islamists of all kind. Russian fascists love Obama just for this and now they've got a permanent foothold in Syria. No more America there. American interests = stability and peace in the ME, because oil prices skyrocket with each instability. Obama's result = war in Syria.
9643 2018-11-05 06:31:07 Now they turn the clock back and say there is no evidence of oil
9644 2018-11-05 06:31:01 The same people calling for sanctions on Iran are people that would’ve approved of the Shah from the 1970s.The US/ Europe ONLY want to secure Iran’s oil reserves, it doesn’t care about Human rights or westernizing the region and uses humanitarianism to promote military takeovers.

9737 2018-11-05 06:18:21 Heavy crude has higher distillate yield than light. The reason is that they have more residual fuel oil (long chain hydrocarbons) which can be converted to diesel in cracker and cokers. You can make long chain hydrocarbons shorter but cannot make short chain hydrocarbons longer

9814 2018-11-05 06:07:35 BJP at centre, bjp in haryana where most of stubble burning takes place. Gets 3000 Cr from oil companies to build a statue, but no money to supply equipment for value addition from crop residue. PRIORITIES 
9815 2018-11-05 06:07:29 Oh yeah, I have insomnia pretty badly and I’m trying to tire myself out so that I can get up early to get a oil change xD

9824 2018-11-05 06:05:32 I'm super sorry, I just think it's important to recognize that racism and white supremacy is literally entrenched in America as a whole. It's a country built on stolen land by slave labour; engages in a perpetual war on Black people; bombs Brown people in the Middle East for oil!

9843 2018-11-05 06:02:00 Night time: Same cleanser, but I use Real Art Mild Cleasing Oil before the Cerave, then I repeat my morning steps but incorporate The Ordinary’s AHA and BHA chemical exfoliant once a week after cleansing, and I use Kiehl’s midnight recovery serum in place of the Hyaluronic.
9844 2018-11-05 06:02:00 There’s more up than down to climate investing. The oil will run out. The sun, wind and heat from the earth will be around as long as humanity calls this planet home. This is where we make the switch. It’s historic. Energy is bigger than the internet.

9846 2018-11-05 06:01:48 Lemme just throw out that our oil comes from California, and nearly all of our coal and natural gas comes from various other states. Solar and wind are the only way we can produce energy that comes ONLY from Arizona, and there are WAY more jobs to be had HERE because of that.
9847 2018-11-05 06:01:42 yeah i definitely have bio oil!!! as well as some pharmaceutical grade stuff for healing scars;; I need to have sections of skin removed and instead of an incision it's literally just....areas of skin. so it's just scary how much more noticeable it is overall
9848 2018-11-05 06:01:08 Yes. Follow the money. Look at oil company profits vs. scientists.
9849 2018-11-05 06:01:06 How much did the war in Iraq cost us?  Our border is much more important than your oil.

9857 2018-11-05 06:00:08 I’d suggest adding an oil after that at night.
9858 2018-11-05 05:59:53 Bio oil. Use that stuff and you won’t be able to see the scar hardly. I’ve used it after I had a mole on my face removed(for self confidence reasons so I hear ya there)The scar is like 9O% gone. Can barely see it. You can just get it at your local stores pharmacy area.
9859 2018-11-05 05:59:09 does any1 have some tea tree oil that i can borrow
9860 2018-11-05 05:59:07 I didn't share @pencerw, but last year I tried my hand at making olive oil at home after collecting a bunch of fruit from my relative's trees here in L.A., I learned _a lot_. I think I'm going to make a press and try again next year

9864 2018-11-05 05:57:46 Okay a lot of drying products here, like your cleanser and acne treatment. And no hydrator. Also add an oil.
9865 2018-11-05 05:57:37 #BREAKING: All sanctions removed under the 2015 nuclear deal have been reinstated. They target shipping, oil exports and banks. Overall, it targets all parts of the #Iranian economy.

9874 2018-11-05 05:56:11 It wouldn't harm anything except oil executives' Christmas bonuses. Do some research please.
9875 2018-11-05 05:55:54 What a great book that talked about the civil war....   Also read "There was a country" by Chinua Achebe

9876 2018-11-05 05:55:42 Putting some lavender essential oil in my diffuser, listen to some relaxing music & try to have a good night & good sleep tonight  hope you all sleep good & have a good night tonight!!
9877 2018-11-05 05:55:36 What a pile of BS. Supporting a pipeline 2 legitimize & transport the filthiest of the planet’s oil through BC’s pristine, highly sensitive marine areas only 2 be refined in Asia & perhaps repurchased by us suckers, does not an environment minister make. It’s just dirty politics.

9937 2018-11-05 05:44:09 SYRIAN WAR...To protect the value of its petro dollar the US desperately wants an oil pipeline to reach from Saudi Arabia, through Syria and Turkey on into Europe, this as an effort to steal Russia's oil sales to Europe in order to help keep the US petro dollar strong.
9938 2018-11-05 05:44:05 Hey red head husband, the only thing keeping a bunch of us from coming up and challenging you to a duel is that, well Massachusetts is cold and while we are fierce, there is all that snow and traffic.

9941 2018-11-05 05:43:55 Oh I know. Here in Australia items will be marked with “made us sustainable palm oil sources” or something of the like. Apparently Dove is still using the palm oil that’s causing SO much damage.

9970 2018-11-05 05:38:52 Gotta start thawing it a day or two ahead of time. Empty it out, clean it up. I personally recommend aromatics in there like lemon and garlic, with seasonings + olive oil on skin, if baked. If fried, dry it off, rub on seasonings, and in it goes for time related to the weight.

9976 2018-11-05 05:37:08 The statement that the statue was funded by Gujarat government is false. Central government PSUs contributed generously for the project. Oil marketing companies that fleece consumers contributed most for the cause

9994 2018-11-05 05:34:36 Maybe because I didn’t use any oil. I used leave in conditioner and bouncy pudding curls
9995 2018-11-05 05:34:19 Nailing down the big oil vote
9996 2018-11-05 05:33:58 Lol it's a scam to keep big oil in the EV revolution. You can't give hydrogen cars away.
