0 2018-10-21 23:59:47 Hey, how about we don't buy their oil, too???  Then we can really cut off our noses to spite our faces.  I don't give 2 shits about the Saudis murdering their own citizens.
1 2018-10-21 23:59:45 Please read "Confessions of an Economic Hitman" by John Perkins.  In it he describes how he participated in the American's systematic corrupting of Saudi Royalty, to get them to agree to sell their oil only in US dollars (and buy U S T-bills with the money).

5 2018-10-21 23:58:53 Price of oil drops and the media is pushing a war with Saudi Arabia, not suspicious at all.
6 2018-10-21 23:58:31 Push for people to move to EVs is a push for more consumer consumption.

Greens must think that the steel, plastics, rare earth metals, nickel needed for EV's materialise like magic a la Star Trek. No mining, refining, coal burning or crude oil required.
7 2018-10-21 23:58:15 Why do I have to keep making the point that there is no such thing as a healthy oil! It drives me nuts when doctors (who typically get NO nutrional education) make that claim.
8 2018-10-21 23:58:13 Trump is hoping for back door oil deals from Kushner. That is why Pompeno took $100million dollor my bad check from them

11 2018-10-21 23:58:03 Mainly because they believe it’ll make them more oily. But there are oils that stop the production of excess oil.. it sounds counterintuitive but very effective
12 2018-10-21 23:58:02 It isn't being used to snake oil for me, it's that Trump is so inarticulate, limited vocabulary that makes him hard to listen to.  On the other hand, those are also the same reasons his humor works.   But he isn't snake oil free by far either!

Can't find any olive oil, naturally 
But I did find a package of cookies that I hid in that cabinet
And bacon grease can take the place as olive oil, right? #kindaketo #mykidwonteatitanyway
39 2018-10-21 23:57:01 Overfilled oil? Come on, that's a late modified mistake.

42 2018-10-21 23:56:29 We don't buy saudi oil.  We are an exporter not an importer of oil!

48 2018-10-21 23:55:55 LA has lots of oil off shore for decades. Knew folks that worked the rigs. Glad you did some research, not-a-Texan. Hook ‘em up, Bot.

52 2018-10-21 23:54:31 I'm a bit late to the party, but why not try a mixture of hydraters and moisturisers. I usually mix my epaderm cream/ ointment with hemp(it's basically 70% omega 3 and 6) and jojoba oil. And i usually go down in intensity of cream to lower the dependance on it.
53 2018-10-21 23:54:24 People ask what I use for it coconut oil and olive oil 
54 2018-10-21 23:54:23 Promising to bring back coal mining, to double down on oil drilling, and to deny the development of green fuels is not only short-sighted and regressionist, it's no more sustainable now than it was when you left your home town for something better.
55 2018-10-21 23:54:17 Im in the kitchen crying after rubbing my eyes with chili oil on my fingers and because I forgot to out non-stick spray on my potatoes  
56 2018-10-21 23:54:00 Let's keep using gas and oil. Let's not build green infrastructure for the next Thousand Years. Gas and oil are the smart choice. #Dinosaurs
57 2018-10-21 23:53:42 Mountaineer Brand beard wash and oil makes my face very happy.
58 2018-10-21 23:53:27 We worked in the oil and gas industry for years.  It’s not “if” there is a spill...it’s “when”. Save your nonsense about people wanting off shore drilling.  Not in Florida where we know that tourism supports the state.
59 2018-10-21 23:53:24 @dallascowboys Jerry Jones fire the mediocre piece of garbage of a head coach - he has been mediocre for 9 years - if your oil fields don’t produce oil you shut them down - SHUT DOWN JASON FREAKIN GARRETT - HE SUCKS - The Cowboy fans deserve better than mediocre
60 2018-10-21 23:53:24 This is why I try to not use oil as much as possible. The only reason I have any part in it at all is because I don't have better options available.

Thankfully that's changing. Too bad we don't have the proper industry here to keep from also funding China's electronics industry.

62 2018-10-21 23:52:38 they've stopped all oil imports from the united states so to stop all oil from iran as well would be an amazing feat
63 2018-10-21 23:52:20 sadly true, Saudi has been the US's second biggest ally in the middle East providing them with terrorists they can use to attack US for which they can blame a completely unrelated country so that they can steal their oil..i mean liberate them....
64 2018-10-21 23:52:03 omg true, i need some maracuja oil
65 2018-10-21 23:51:54 I hate when people lay down their lumpia instead of standing it up to drain after they take it out of the oil. I wanted to eat lumpia not eat oil

69 2018-10-21 23:51:05 Hi. Awak pakai oil balancing dgn hydration light moist  tu serentak ke ? :)
70 2018-10-21 23:51:03 Please for the love of god I wanna see you guys working out together and rubbing oil on each other  #sorrynotsorry
71 2018-10-21 23:50:59 Applying coconut oil and aloe Vera to my life cause wtf
72 2018-10-21 23:50:55 Might be more clear if she mentioned the oil sales, but the arms exports are scraps for the media mob.
73 2018-10-21 23:50:31 I volunteer to give a hot oil massage.
74 2018-10-21 23:50:25 My Sonic refuses to give up its oil. Needs full synthetic but I’m at 7k and not a hint of loss yet. Best car I’ve ever had, <.20 a mile to drive.
75 2018-10-21 23:49:57 My hair tears really bad and my split ends end up super noticeable, so I try and use argon oil every night. It’s not a fix all, but it keeps it looking healthier a little longer
76 2018-10-21 23:49:54 One point to add: 
We call it short cycle investment for a reason: unlike the oil sand projects or major deep offshore where projects are looked at over 20-30 year period and any decline is prices is relatively short lived, it needs high prices in the short run
77 2018-10-21 23:49:30 The us saudi relation has been that saudi sells when prices are high to lower them.  With climate change we no longer need to buy oil.  We need to get renewables up, and we should just drop saudi.  They're not really our friends.
78 2018-10-21 23:49:24 I hope you ain’t pay siscause that ain’t it, and it’s hard af to get rid of that oil without having to rewash it
79 2018-10-21 23:49:20 Trump hasn’t seen a mob. Wait til he tries to keep Native Americans from voting? Will shy North Dakotan’s stand up to support the people whose land they are farming? Whose oil they are getting from their lands? The hole world is watching!
80 2018-10-21 23:49:20 How did their conversations with the oil & gas industry go, or the people of taranaki, or the pupils at charter schools? Stop being so holier than thou!
81 2018-10-21 23:49:20 I need an oil change and I’m not talking  about for my car

83 2018-10-21 23:49:17 It's a spread made with dried yellow split peas, with some red onion, green onion, garlic, and olive oil blended in.
84 2018-10-21 23:49:00 On the oil I can make some terrible decisions lol..
85 2018-10-21 23:48:50 Just spent some “me” time with a wonderful bath with eucalyptus oil and then rubbed coconut oil over my body, I am LIVING
86 2018-10-21 23:48:43 Making volunteers serve dozens of deployments is criminal. That's what happens when you start a war we weren't equipped for. The reservist aren't supposed to be deployed for 14 yearsAnd the VA wasn't prepared either but Cheney didn't give a . He wanted the oil in Iraq.
87 2018-10-21 23:48:36 Another issue that makes punishment of Saudi Arabia almost impossible outside of oil, is that a lot of the Islamic extremist world views an affront to the Saudis as an affront to Mecca
88 2018-10-21 23:48:21 This is crazy. This tweet just came on my timeline. I went to ESA 19-20 yrs ago for my 1001’s and EMT-A. Glad to see you doing well.
89 2018-10-21 23:48:15 Quarterling, you still fail to see that even if CBD oil did absolutely nothing and G Fuel was just piss in a can it would still be much different than the situation with Better Help. These are just dumb takes.
90 2018-10-21 23:48:14 poorest part of Britain how can we be ? We have 96%of oil ,100% Scotch whisky the best water in the world in which is  sold and all this money goes straight to the English treasury as do all the taxes , we are given a portion back (Barnett formula) and your mob call it a grant
91 2018-10-21 23:48:11 OILさんは大歓迎です!!
一度でもご依頼下さった皆様は今まで通り、ご対応させて頂けたらと思っております☆

92 2018-10-21 23:47:57 About time i freaking do my oil change
93 2018-10-21 23:47:46 We are ALL 'most affected' by ending dependance on oil! Get familiar fast with the energy alternatives and be ready for the new clean jobs that will save the bloody planet for ALL OF US!
94 2018-10-21 23:47:25 @JustinTrudeau is their greatest Canadian enabler. By preventing Canadian oil from reaching market he is enriching and empowering this tyrannical regime.
95 2018-10-21 23:47:13 At Fresh Kind Farms, we want you to be kind to your body. That's why our tinctures are made with the highest quality ingredients including  avocado oil, Sunflower Lecithin, and premium extracted flower.
   We could use cheaper ingredients - but we care about you and what we do.
96 2018-10-21 23:46:40 And as far as Osama Bin Laden goes, how about we talk about Regan training and arming the Mujahideen who trained Bin Laden, or how his dad, made wealthy on construction contracts paid for by GHW Bush & his oil cronies funded Al Queda? Or how GW Bush stopped us from killing OBL?
97 2018-10-21 23:46:19 @AskTSA my mother is currently taking CBD oil (without the THC) in gummy bear form. She does not have a prescription since is available at health food stores. Is she allowed to take the labeled bottle on the plane?
98 2018-10-21 23:46:06 Digital right now for regular prints on gloss cardstock, going to be doing an oil piece with similar layout after
99 2018-10-21 23:46:05 Yes.  Sorry if I was overly pugnacious.  I don't accept that we just need to put up with a thuggish monarchy merely because they have oil.  Realize there are not many good choices for allies in ME

101 2018-10-21 23:45:25 @kabunky I had the opportunity to try your Fruit Salad Strain oil.  It blew my mind.  Such a relaxed feeling.  I then became “Aware” of everything at once.  Suddenly a fit of laughter that I could not control.  Very good stuff thank you!
102 2018-10-21 23:45:24 Layman's terms = "leakage".

If Canada does not provide the oil, gas, mining etc - another country will i.e. the GHG emissions "leak" from Canada to another jurisdiction.

The "90%" addresses that issue.
103 2018-10-21 23:45:03 Tell them to stick the #oil up their #ass
104 2018-10-21 23:45:02 N garlic SnP and olive oil. Kinda like a fajita...right? Lol
105 2018-10-21 23:44:51 At a new restaurant in Fairfax. MashAllah they just serve some lovely oil with traces of nihari inside.
106 2018-10-21 23:44:48 I use the joico oil babe after I straighten it and I feel like it really helps it ! I also do coconut oil treatments like once a week and that also helps 
107 2018-10-21 23:43:51 That’s why I hope Trump hits them with sanctions. Leverages the UN to take action and implement sanctions. Opens up our oil reserves to hurt them financially. I just wish wish we would pump and refine more of our own oil. We don’t need them that’s a fake bill of sale
108 2018-10-21 23:43:32 Likely hoping to earn enough to pay cartels to smuggle her children in as well.
How many would make it unharmed? 
Leaving your children in a car, running into a 7-11 is child abuse or letting them walk to a park. in some people's eyes, mainly leftists.
109 2018-10-21 23:43:25 You see I’m a little confused @JustinTrudeau and @liberal_party you want to charge me more taxes for more carbon used like oil and gasoline. You want my tax money (a lot of my money) to build #transmountain which just adds to pollution. You just want my money. I’m voting PC

111 2018-10-21 23:43:06 CBD oil acquired. Look out world, here comes Amanda.
112 2018-10-21 23:43:00 Plus those oil companies care little for the communities that opened their arms for them and abandon them as soon as their profit margins reduced.
113 2018-10-21 23:42:52 I know it's a joke and that baby oil is made FOR babies, but I still felt like 
Although, the logic of baby oil doesn't work for when you look up rapeseed oil(a variety of it is canola oil, btw).

115 2018-10-21 23:42:27 Jerry Jones went from being an oil salesman to a snake oil salesman.

117 2018-10-21 23:41:54 #WTI #Oil #OOTT
The bullish gap occurred at the open was due to the weekend news of the murder of a #Saudi journalist. The fuel was not enough to carry #USOil much higher. The gap was faded immediately thereafter.
118 2018-10-21 23:41:50 Banana blossoms & nectar are really potent in antimicrobial properties, looking to make that into an oil once the trees in the yard start to bloom
119 2018-10-21 23:41:38 There’s no legal CBD oil left in Ontario and I’m in a state with CBD oil coming out the wazoo and I can’t bring it back w/ me.
120 2018-10-21 23:41:35 God was with you Captain and your aim was true with your heart. Will you be celebrating with squirrel oil and a new pair of woolen foot covers?
121 2018-10-21 23:41:34 And what kinda fun did You have???
Were you filling tanks, or did somebody dip their oil stick in your reservoir????
Just saying.........
122 2018-10-21 23:41:32 Oil City! Have you ever run the Drake Well Marathon?
123 2018-10-21 23:41:24 Got me some castor oil 
124 2018-10-21 23:41:20 Lololol! You don’t know how much I’m dreading an oil change right now. I’m like two months overdue 
125 2018-10-21 23:41:13 You mean a team you probably only supported when they got that oil money?

127 2018-10-21 23:40:45 Congress doesn't even want to investigate Trump ties to Russia. And the Saudi's give us oil. I hope to see the day in my lifetime that we no longer depend on oil and can tell every country that holds us hostage, to shove it. #Resist and vote blue.
128 2018-10-21 23:40:36 美少年は今日も可愛いなー！
129 2018-10-21 23:40:27 Nobody cuts relations with Saudis. They have got lots of oil. Even Turkey isn't willing 2 terminate relation with Riyad even though this horrendous crime taken place on their soil. So cage Somali joogtaa?
130 2018-10-21 23:40:16 I wouldn’t have been able to find a job back then. Oil was still being formed. 
131 2018-10-21 23:40:14 Yes but real people takiing salaries to "build" a useless train that isnt even current tech. Gov wont fund new tech. If we wanted a bullet train or hyperloop we could have one. Too bad everyone needs to get kickbacks, frivilous lawsuits delay construction & big oil lobby big

136 2018-10-21 23:39:47 No queen creek olive oil?
137 2018-10-21 23:39:36 We really don't need Saudi oil. 45+idiot, only wants to keep his personal business solid. We are allied with other Arab countries but, they have no oil. The oil businessmen in this country, keep them fat and happy. The Saudis teach American hate in their classrooms.
138 2018-10-21 23:39:23 I’ve leveled up on the basic scale with the purchase of an oil diffuser today. If you see me with a PSL, please just punch me.

143 2018-10-21 23:38:20 Yep. Nuclear power and kindness is the way. To Hell with the antidemocratic bodypart chopping Saudis, their corrupt oil choking our planet, and the Salafi-Wahhabi-jihadis it funds. 15/19 hijackers on 9/11 were Saudis and you still don’t get it. Nobody needs allies like these!

154 2018-10-21 23:37:12 The addiction to OIL is not a few CEOs. It's everybody. It's not connection, it is COMFORT in this case. ALSO CONNECTED PEOPLE do NOT want to SPEND TIME on the gritty stuff.

165 2018-10-21 23:35:52 Choppy chop onions. Frying pan, empty, goes on medium-high heat. When pan is hot, add oil / butter to pan, let it melty melt. Onions go in, should sizzle sizzle. If onions get to dark too quick, lower heat. Stir occasionally to avoid burning. Cook forever. FOREVER. F O R E V E R
166 2018-10-21 23:35:42 IT SEEMS SAUDI POLITICS MUST MOVE IN THE DIRECTION WHERE OIL RESOURCES BELONG TO ALL SAUDI PEOPLE & NOT COLONIAL POLITICS WHERE INDIVIDUALS OR CORPORATIONS MAKE NATIONAL RESOURCES PRIVATE
167 2018-10-21 23:35:39 Of Course......Saudi Arabia is the strongest ally USA has in the Middle East besides Israel. No matter who is the President, you thing they are going to cut ties with them?? Saudi Arabia is the strongest against Iran, Hezbollah and more besides 20% oil to the USA

174 2018-10-21 23:35:24 i was today years old when i burned fish sticks trying to cook them on the stove top.

fortunately the entire apartment now smells like oil so i've got that going for me
175 2018-10-21 23:35:01 Its funny that a lot of people think that we'll have another 'sustainable' energy source that will allow everything we know today to continue indefinitely! If I could get rid of other plastics (oil) in my life I would!
176 2018-10-21 23:34:57 why anyone in 2018 would want to drill for oil in such amazing forests, prairies and reserves is beyond me...incredible photos man
177 2018-10-21 23:34:54 My dad really woke up early today to put new tires on my car & change the oil so it could be ready before I went to work. No matter how old I get he makes sure to still spoil me 
178 2018-10-21 23:34:52 "As at 1960....Nigeria citizens (without crude oil) were richer than citizens of

was the discovery of crude oil in Nigeria a blessing or a curse?"

180 2018-10-21 23:34:47 Don’t be fooled, Amendment 74 is bad for Colorado. It does not protect communities, it protects oil & gas companies. #no74 #copolitics @ConservationCO
181 2018-10-21 23:34:46 While I agree fossil fuels are bad for the environment, oil is easily the most important resource in human history. How do we just stop using it?
182 2018-10-21 23:34:45 MOTIVA Oil, owned 100%, March 2017 by MbS and family. I have a relative who retired as of May 2018 from Port Arthur refinery and Houston Headquarters. This murder is no bueno for employees and the stigma is never going away. So there's that. Political suicide for all involved.
183 2018-10-21 23:34:42 My mama roasted bts hair . She was like why don’t we (the fans) say something & i was like WE DO. Even she knows they need some deep conditioner & a good hot oil treatment. She said they got too much money for they hair to look like that

193 2018-10-21 23:33:31 sugar, lemon, coconut oil
194 2018-10-21 23:33:13 1. Open the borders and remove duty on all basic commodities. Cooking oil, sugar, flour, meats.
2.Remove Bond Note and replace it with RANDS. This means kombis and small transactions can flow.
3.Preserve peoples Savings in banks. Those are dollar amounts.
195 2018-10-21 23:32:48 How you gonna speak to me and go to your LS about me... should’ve threw my damn oil on you.
196 2018-10-21 23:32:23 My phone fell in my plate. It has oil in it. Now it is all greasy. #HolyShit.
197 2018-10-21 23:31:55 If the people "caravanning" from the south had the oil, and the saudi's had nothing but sand, Trump would be welcoming them with open arms and bombing the f out of Saudi's.
198 2018-10-21 23:31:48 So we call it peanut oil because it's made from crushed peanut ok

202 2018-10-21 23:31:11 The US needs to intercept the caravan. When others won't control their borders, the US must in the name of national security. This is akin to Nixon having plans to seize Saudi oil fields during the time of the Yom Kippur War. @WalidPhares

209 2018-10-21 23:30:25 really neat that after burning myself with hot oil it just kinda went away after a couple hours. that shit was sore as hell i'm glad it didn't stick around
210 2018-10-21 23:30:23 Can't remember the brand but our oil less fryer only cost us about 40$ and we use it for everything
211 2018-10-21 23:30:02 @WBrettWilson why does Alberta not build its own refinery? How can it be more economical to export AB oil and import Saudi oil? I assume you’ve looked at this option and would value your input/response so I could learn
212 2018-10-21 23:29:16 This is the perfect time and reason to start using our own oil.

Saudis are not a US ally, they use us for weapons and we use them for oil.

223 2018-10-21 23:26:56 thanks, it’s the oil
224 2018-10-21 23:26:42 Just appalling how he lies and gets away with it. Saudi Arabia has been a destabilising force in the Middle East since its inception. They should go back to their Bedouin routes now that oil is running out
225 2018-10-21 23:26:23 The British that created Nigeria did do it because they loved us and want us to live in peace. Remember the saying "the north and the south is like water and oil that can never mix". Nigeria was to serve their own interests. NIGERIA CAN NEVER WORK.
226 2018-10-21 23:26:22 Oil. Did I say Oil?  Oil.
227 2018-10-21 23:26:17 It's not about our direct buys. It's about our setting a de facto global standard of flex fuel capability thus ending oil's monopoly
228 2018-10-21 23:26:16 Also shoutout to my grandma for money for an oil change
229 2018-10-21 23:25:59 Medical marijuana in Virginia next year. Works better than opiods or a shot of morphine. Right now holding on with CBD oil made from hemp. No THC in it but helps me with nausea, anxiety, some pain and sleep.
230 2018-10-21 23:25:46 Wait, what did you use the oil for?
231 2018-10-21 23:25:44 For two years, the GOP has driven our great country like a rental car. We’re about to get it back with beer cans in the back seat, ash trays full and the oil two quarts low, but it will be ours again and we will fix it!

In other news, my synthetic oil change was free too.
Today was a good day.
234 2018-10-21 23:25:32 Climate Change as a problem is a hoax. 

The real issue is man made pollution. 

But litre does not play to the extremists agenda, which is killed not the Canadian Oil Industry as competition to the US, Russians and Saudis
235 2018-10-21 23:25:29 Shocker. Papers in red parts of Colorado dominated by the oil and gas industry support the candidate who is in bed with the oil and gas industry. 

I wonder what the Greely students who were forced to evacuate a football game bc of a gas leak last fall think about this?
236 2018-10-21 23:25:23 In this photo I took a shower and let it dry w/o doing a single thing to it lol I'm flattered

Typically tho I pass on shampoo and conditioner and try to only cleanse myself in clean water

Then comb through and add some coconut oil :)

239 2018-10-21 23:24:35 5-10yrs from now, tops.

"Bonus": once they take control for water, they also take extra arable land and mineral/oil/gas/forestry resources.

241 2018-10-21 23:24:34 got CBD oil for my anxiety 
only took 2 droplets of it because I’m a hypochondriac & my mind literally will not allow me to take the recommended dose until I feel safe with it ... this is what anxiety is like
242 2018-10-21 23:24:33 To be honest we don't really need those jobs we need our market back. Our mines, our oil. You know how it works corporations reap off countries with your government's help. So you're responsible too!

Even ask?
Didnt Obama bow before the Saudies?
How is that Russian uranium deal going for them? 
They turning a decent profit off it?
245 2018-10-21 23:23:32 Modiji noted that the oil market is producer driven and both the quantity and prices are determined by the oil prodding countries

249 2018-10-21 23:22:49 Wants the US dependent on foreign oil.
250 2018-10-21 23:22:33 Saudi Arabia has never been “good”. Ever. We need independence from foreign oil & gas. 3rd world countries need to join this century. WE (USA) can’t tell them how to run their country anymore than they can tell us.
251 2018-10-21 23:22:22 Only if they oil him up before they leave.

256 2018-10-21 23:21:33 Must have missed the tweets where you support pipelines and oil sand workers.
257 2018-10-21 23:21:28 Already addressed. Oil price spikes can cost even more, especially when they crash the economy and cost millions of jobs.

263 2018-10-21 23:21:01 That's the thing, The Paris accord, we where the only country that wasn't trying to pollute the earth. Take a pool, put 10 barrels of crude oil around it. Now punch a hole in nine of the barrels. Now do u think it matters to the pool that 1 out 10 ain't polluting it ???
264 2018-10-21 23:20:57 Been on CBD oil since May. Two dogs quit sertraline, and three dogs quit fluoxetine. Haven’t noticed any marked difference in behavior, so we’ve stayed off the meds and on CBD. It’s def helped me with joint (knee) issues!
265 2018-10-21 23:20:56 BS, why should this country destroy a relationship with a foreign government that controls the price of crude oil worldwide over an incident involving one of their dissident citizens that attacked his own government and family using the power of the pen/press. Don’t think so!
266 2018-10-21 23:20:42 I'll tell you this new generation. 
So they have olive oil in a spray can for cooking now back in my day the only one oil you sprayed was when you got hit with it using the stone wheel to press the olives.  Now the women back then had  some glutes and a mean back hand made lol

271 2018-10-21 23:20:20 Of course, neither one of you were alive when the whole Middle East put an embargo on USA for oil, because we supported Israel in 1973. They are not nice people and while we can coexist with Saudis, they are not our friends. Remember back to Desert Storm, they took credit.
272 2018-10-21 23:20:16 I've seen the ads, I think. Meant to be healthier and use less oil?

280 2018-10-21 23:19:20 What exactly is all the aid we send to the region being used for?
 Is it having any effect at all?
What is the level of accountability for it?
What areas might be addressed more than others to make region safer and more habitable.

282 2018-10-21 23:19:14 i sorta create a lazy man's sandwich press, i put three table spoons of butter in the skillet and then use a smaller skillet to push down hard on the sandwich, and on the bottom of the smaller skillet coat it with some butter as well, to avoid stick. Ideally you can use veg oil

288 2018-10-21 23:18:24 @Justintrudeau would rather buy Saudi oil.  Wait! Didn't Saudis just butcher a journalist? Guess that's ok with Justin.  Far better making Saudis filthy rich than helping our own oil industry.
289 2018-10-21 23:18:20 As it's the fat that's the solvent for the spicy stuff, ¿ maybe butter or oil ?

293 2018-10-21 23:18:07 There was a huge increase in domestic production during the Obama years. USA is #1 oil producer in the world, slightly ahead of Russia and Saudi Arabia
294 2018-10-21 23:18:02 An overhead loudspeaker crackles to life, ‘Citizen! Report immediately to the National Baby Oil Slip-n-Slide.’
295 2018-10-21 23:17:59 Remember the  Dakota Pipe line?  I do,  and am still amazed at the power of big oil and the politicians who allowed this to happen.  The same outrage will happen again in the beautiful shores of Maine.  Trump love it

296 2018-10-21 23:17:23 Anything's a bottle of oil if you're valid enough.
297 2018-10-21 23:17:21 you should use gas prices not oil, correlation with gas price is not 1, not even close. also common sense count the models of SUV before 1995. (you should also separate pickup trucks). and you should include interest rates it's interesting.
298 2018-10-21 23:17:14 I need some coconut oil.

305 2018-10-21 23:16:50 Propellant free olive oil spray is the best invention of the 21st century. Discuss.
306 2018-10-21 23:16:44 Turns out extra virgin olive oil is the best oil to use when frying and not the likes of grape seed oil or canola oil. The adage that the higher the smoke point the healthier the oil is total garbage.   #cooking #food #twitch #twitchstreamer #twitchfoodstreamer #twitchfood
307 2018-10-21 23:16:41 We sell coal to them by the ship. We export a ton of resources to them. LNG soon. 

We don’t buy oil there. Do we?
308 2018-10-21 23:16:27 Leftists call for an economy that respects the environment. How many Democrats are calling for an end to the oil/gas economy and a ban on fracking, and a huge investment in renewable energy? How many see climate change as a serious threat that needs urgent action?
309 2018-10-21 23:16:04 i use coconut oil religiously
310 2018-10-21 23:15:59 You mean stockbrokers, lobbyists, yacht crews & oil execs are employed and doing well.
311 2018-10-21 23:15:53 Oh I know your type alright. You just as soon bomb an entire country for bananas, minerals and oil, and when the people start fleeing in droves, you separate the families and put everybody in cages.
312 2018-10-21 23:15:42 Donald Trump and his family, fortunately, will not always be in the White House. HE is deliberately continuing with his families connections with oil rich countries, as President, so he can keep those connections when a private citizen.

315 2018-10-21 23:15:15 I had tried tea tree oil before and it seems like it made it worst lol. But okay thank you. I think the moisturizer I be using right now is clogging my pores or something 
316 2018-10-21 23:15:10 I can't see it happening myself. I've changed fry vat oil and the stuff we used was basically solid until it was hot, and you wouldn't be drinking hot fry vat oil.

324 2018-10-21 23:14:02 Is pot oil less strong than smoking weed? Asking for a friend.
325 2018-10-21 23:13:22 Ex.
I can understand why a hard working coal miner doesn't want the US to reduce coal and oil production, but climate change is a reality!
326 2018-10-21 23:13:14 Good luck buying from the Russians. We do not need a friend such as you. I am willing to sacrifice financially. There is more than money and oil in this world.
327 2018-10-21 23:13:13 LOL it's really unhealthy considering how much oil and sugar is needed for it but it's worth
328 2018-10-21 23:13:07 I lived in Pittsburgh and can say that place made amazing progress in cleaning up the filthy city I knew as a kid. Let’s not let oil and coal mongering oligarchs take us backwards. #VoteBlue2018
329 2018-10-21 23:12:54 So you are saying the fact that we BUY $2B a year or oil from a hardly ethical “regime” is either irrelevant or unimportant - although we could be buying oil from Canada instead?

What planet did you wander in from?

331 2018-10-21 23:12:44 No, that means that whatever Facebook seems to be Fake or inappropriate will be eliminated.

FB, Twitter & Google needs to be regulated by the government.
Similar to how Standard Oil prompted the Sherman Anti Trust Act.
332 2018-10-21 23:12:36 CJ Beathard has taken an absolute BEATING today. @RamsNFL have sacked him 7 times (4 by DT Aaron Donald) #Niners were leaking oil all day.

335 2018-10-21 23:12:18 Manufactured fake outrage is @CNN's primary news product.  Just surprised Oliver didn't try to get @TheRock to certify the gasoline he uses in his cars is free of Saudi oil - because that's where he'd probably like to take this!

341 2018-10-21 23:11:38 But that doesn't mean you should be buy into a different brand of snake oil, and it CERTAINLY doesn't mean I'ma let it pass without comment.
342 2018-10-21 23:11:34 The Saudi Arabian government says it will build a  $500 billion mega-city, with the goal of diversifying its economy to  focus less on crude oil.
343 2018-10-21 23:11:24 Which has more volume: a Boombox or an oil drum?

All motorists are encouraged to protest the ridiculous fuel prices that the oil companies gouging us with. If we all stop buying fuel on these days it will highlight the communities dislike at their attitude to all.
348 2018-10-21 23:10:56 They probably are. Because the ££ is worth DIDDLY SQUAT. But Scotland has oil & whisky & loads of other resources (fact is, Scotland is the only UK nation IN THE BLACK) which is worth a lot more than an English £ & thus a rock!

356 2018-10-21 23:10:01 What I don’t understand is why, oh why dear Jamal did you go there by yourself? the Saudis are bound to get away with this.

362 2018-10-21 23:09:25 Publicly-traded companies are often restrained by board ethics standards that will prevent them dealing further with the bloody regime in Riyadh. Let's see how the oil companies decide to play this.

372 2018-10-21 23:07:08 Garbage. The people at the counter act like they’re doing you a favor, when they wait on you. Last time I went for an oil change, I was there over 2 hours. Went for a bad battery recently and sit there over an hour. I won’t be back.

378 2018-10-21 23:05:40 Where has the outrage been for the last 60 years the US has been a partner in Saudi Arabia buying oil while women were being stoned to death in the town square? Why now for a journalist? Hypocrisy!
379 2018-10-21 23:05:26 What’s he going to do?  Not sell us oil when we’ve become a net exporter?  Buy inferior weapons systems?  Get real mad and hold his breath until we say sorry?

401 2018-10-21 23:01:24 The Average hourly wage growth has been 2.7% over the past year, anemic given the power and length of the economic expansion. Making matters worse, a surge of inflation, driven by higher oil prices, has clawed back almost all those wage gains.

The Corp tax cuts were for what?
402 2018-10-21 23:01:24 Which is why mega-polluting agri & oil corps as well as big pharma & healthcare agencies; weapon manufacturers; corrupt Wall Street & big banks & their lobbyists pour cash & goodies into BOTH R & D campaigns.
403 2018-10-21 23:01:20 I love CBD for topical use. Works great for sore and stiff hands, wrists, and neck. Any LP oil works. Maybe best to get one indicated for topical use - which appear to be marketed towards sexual applications

419 2018-10-21 22:59:24 Oh babe, I’ve been doing them the past few months with small breaks in between but my eyelashes are fine. I’ve just never removed them myself, maybe that’s why. Make sure you use castor oil to grow your natural ones back 
420 2018-10-21 22:59:01 Just got a CBD oil pen and oh my gosh my neck pain I’ve had for DAYS is gone 
421 2018-10-21 22:58:54 You may look at fats to get the needed calories for maintenance, much easier adding olive oil than to increase carbs in my opinion, especially if you’re used to low carb... consider 4 calories per gram C vs 9 cals per gram Fat
422 2018-10-21 22:58:36 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
423 2018-10-21 22:58:31 I wonder what these "concerned oil executives" will ACTUALLY DO.
424 2018-10-21 22:58:25 Oil***

428 2018-10-21 22:58:06 I would have been very surprised if he didn't condemn because that's the only thing he ever does.  Sit back and condemn. He must be condemned oil!
429 2018-10-21 22:57:42 who straightens hair with coconut oil???? What year is this??
430 2018-10-21 22:57:39 Thanks, I’ll do some research :) I do really recommend rosehip oil though! I’ve never had particularly great skin but for the last month until now I’ve been dewy and practically spot-free.
431 2018-10-21 22:57:39 honestly I'm highly disappointed with your words.. May Allah guide us through the right part
432 2018-10-21 22:57:27 1. they have done too much for the oil companies, and have done everything possible to help workers and industry. how would you fund climate research, since the oil companies support the c-tax? increased min wage is the easiest way to boost the economy, as workers spend not hoard
433 2018-10-21 22:57:15 Y’all can’t be taking no bikini pics and ain’t put on no lotion or no oil or ntn .. ass dead ashy talking bout “no worries at all” .. ya need to be worried bout ya skin peeling but ok I guess
434 2018-10-21 22:57:05 uh there should be a military discount on gas/oil since that be the reason we over there
435 2018-10-21 22:56:56 Second, decide how you want to finish it (I never do *just* stain). You can finish with something natural like tung oil, but I prefer good old fashioned varnish (like polyurethane). The water vs oil-based argument applies here too, and in this case I prefer water-based. 2/
436 2018-10-21 22:56:53 Oil change?

@oil_shaeikh you just reminded me of a charity, I call on you and @__yellows to kindly abdicate your antagonism for nothing other than Allah's sake.
441 2018-10-21 22:56:35 Basically the period you use is to prove your point is highest real oil price in US ever..
442 2018-10-21 22:56:19 It’s my favorite...I Change it and always go back to the snake oil! He is a great peddler of it isn’t he?? Feel free to steal!! Lol
443 2018-10-21 22:55:55 What is really going on,why is jamaica having so many earthquakes,remember they found oil in our seas,it’s all that drilling on the ocean floor...
444 2018-10-21 22:55:50 As a Panthers fan, I agree. Especially since Charlotte was one of the cities targeted by the BLM riots.
445 2018-10-21 22:55:48 I had the same exact problem! I’ve been using a combo of melted coconut oil + olive oil that my nail salon recommended right before bed (leave it on all night) and my cuticles are significantly better already (it’s been 2 weeks!)
446 2018-10-21 22:55:46 I'll try to oil my breast this week 
447 2018-10-21 22:55:45 Trying a mix of coconut oil and tea tree oil to see if that helps my scalp. The red area is shrinking since I eliminated aloe vera from it, but the part that remains is still painful.
448 2018-10-21 22:55:38 Check the History of the Bible David brother's couldn't carry the oil set apart by God for David!
449 2018-10-21 22:55:37 daddy musk is what happens when the ghost of a 14 yr old who died in 2011 and the ghost of a 19th century oil baron try to posses the same body
450 2018-10-21 22:55:34 RENEWABLES  can cut our reliance on oil 

another reason to dump trump is for the USA to get back on board with investing in the future
451 2018-10-21 22:55:32 either way i already know oil spill the move so ima just buy that ticket lol
452 2018-10-21 22:55:16 I came up with the idea of apple oil
453 2018-10-21 22:55:10 The biggest sanction against both KSA and Russia is to do everything we can to lower the price and demand for oil. Depending so much on one resource promotes corruption.
454 2018-10-21 22:55:07 @susaun28 Oh my gosh I just got a great laugh I just saw your bio with the Trump picture snake oil
455 2018-10-21 22:55:04 ah yes, loosing 15billion is a very logical principle to take. We should stop producing oil too! maybe that would fix climate change. It's not a matter of selling the Suadi weapons that is the problem, is a matter of policing them with how they intend to use them.

457 2018-10-21 22:54:47 It really is. I would love to try MMJ. On my meds, I can safely drive. I'd need to have this capability with MMJ or a blend of THC & CBD oil capsules. There's only one way to know how it'll work for me though, and that option isn't an option. It is just as you called it!
458 2018-10-21 22:54:43 Hopefully the Senator understands that a ban on Saudi oil would send prices over $100.
459 2018-10-21 22:54:32 If you go back to 1970, real price of oil was 20USD, today it’s 80..if your argument was true over the long term than light vehicle sales would have increased as proportion of toa, car sales since but that hasn’t happened ..

464 2018-10-21 22:53:57 Please get them checked out and if necessary this is your reminder to change your oil too

466 2018-10-21 22:53:28 [Hurricane Region - Porsche Club of America] Oil change in the 993 today . Been a long time...
467 2018-10-21 22:53:24 Snake oil really, and what exactly have you sacrificed during your privileged life. Armed forces? I last time checked the economy, great, stock market great, unimployment down record #s, I could go on easily but I just don't think you are smart enough. Stronger
468 2018-10-21 22:53:05 Dad Idea,  and will not happen,  why ?  for two reasons, 1. many US politicians are "in Bed" with the Saudis  $$$$$, OIL Companies, 2. if we don't sell them arms they will get them either from the Chinese or the Russians.
469 2018-10-21 22:53:00 Yall I am messed up.... a student who does hair as a gig here...  used coconut oil through out my entire head to straighten it... like my texture did not need that at all.... and honestly idk who does. when I say my hair is super oily .... like i’m pissed.
470 2018-10-21 22:52:59 3 things we need:

  3. More nuclear power

  1. Saudi Arabia

471 2018-10-21 22:52:57 Let them buy from China or Russia. Thats better than selling weapons to kill innocents.

The USA doesnt need Saudi oil. We have oil plus alternative sources & allied countries if we need more.

Until they punish the murderers, including any Americans, we need to shun the govt.
472 2018-10-21 22:52:47 You could use almond oil, or Cucumber slices
473 2018-10-21 22:52:40 Girl I just use shea moisturizing hair products like the shampoo the conditioner and the cream. These I use black Jamaican castor oil  after I wash my hair. Most importantly you gotta keep your ends cut and not apply a lot of heat to your hair.
474 2018-10-21 22:52:32 True. But as my follow-up tweet indicates, the Saudis have been led to believe, for decades, that they cd do things "their way," and the ROW wdn't make a fuss. Partly the leverage that oil gave them, but also a deep comfort w/ authoritarian regimes we found pliable.
475 2018-10-21 22:52:32 I will definitely die some day from an oil fire
476 2018-10-21 22:52:11 My hair is so dry it’s gonna break off I forgot my oil at home
477 2018-10-21 22:52:11 Ahhhhhh...... reading comprehension again as I said "Their way of life" in reference to Europe and Asia and the glow if oil was in reference to the rest of the world  as the US us self sustaining with our own reserves. READ WHAT I WROTE AND NOT WHAT YOU WANT THAT I SAID. Idiot
478 2018-10-21 22:51:54 I heard Dan Shockett say it tasted like motor oil.
479 2018-10-21 22:51:52 Oil executives can be disturbed?    ?    ?
480 2018-10-21 22:51:49 You might try vaping CDB oil. Some people do apparently.
481 2018-10-21 22:51:47 Le cooking oil 
482 2018-10-21 22:51:28 So incredibly true! Hemp seed oil has done wonders for my eczema!
483 2018-10-21 22:51:22 I recommend a hair oil to ALL of my clients bc on the real everyone needs it and yet I don’t have any
484 2018-10-21 22:51:22 Can you please add palm oil in your thread ? It's literally everywhere, from shampoos to cereals and it's harming a lot of rain forests, mostly in Asia, where a lot of primates live...
485 2018-10-21 22:51:04 I’m not debating that oil price swings affect consumer behavior at extremes because the data clearly demonstrates that..but over the longer term it hasn’t impacted consumer preferences for larger vehicles in the US
486 2018-10-21 22:51:03 If you can’t change my oil change my tire I can’t be with you

491 2018-10-21 22:50:21 We can always find work and produce new jobs. It is time to end America's complicity in the abominable conflict in Yemen. We must make amends to those whose lives we helped ruin for the love of money and oil. We should not be a part of the Yemeni holocaust.

493 2018-10-21 22:50:16 Run light truck sales as a proportion of total vehicle sales against real oil prices over thirty year period and correlation doesn’t exist. Seems like it only exists when oil prices hit extremes, but real increase in oil prices occurred while share of light truck sales increased.
494 2018-10-21 22:49:54 Our pollution levels are low compared to others and the Earth has gone through 6 mass extinctions, including "snowball Earth" - ALL well before Man came along. I am all for being Green but it will take some time and the Bush clan is who kept us oil dependent & made deals with SA.
495 2018-10-21 22:49:53 Bolton is corrupt to his core and has a bone to pick with the Iranians and has been used as a pawn since the Bush years.  Russia is smart enough to know that sacrificing a client state like Iran is worth it for checkmate.  Either way the price of oil goes up.

501 2018-10-21 22:48:41 @realDonaldTrump  The only thing you have seriously accomplish is to divide this country with your consistent lies and mocking, you once said of the late John McCain that you like hero's who don't get captured, and "we the people" like our presidents who act like grown ass man!!
502 2018-10-21 22:48:26 Castor oil is also made from the seeds of Ricnius Communis and is used medicinally in small amounts.  Some women have use it to bring about labor near their due dates.  It causes severe gastrointestinal upsets/ contractions.  The plant itself is grown for it's 7 ft. foliage.

506 2018-10-21 22:48:08 Spray the area with pork oil & then they can't walk there cause it is "un-clean"!!  Meanwhile, we will all be voting REPUBLICAN Nov. 6th!!!
507 2018-10-21 22:48:07 with the 1970’s and Thatcher to the shady moving of ancient sea borders (just to keep a claim on Oil they have and continue to exploit) and the so called “Vow” in 2014 and the continued lie about subsidy! The people of Scotland have been treated as second class citizens in their
508 2018-10-21 22:47:26 Perhaps by sanctioning Saudi Arabia, oil could somehow go above $100, US citizens happy that punishing SA, Russia& Saudi Arabia happy that high oil price

521 2018-10-21 22:45:13 Oil executives shocked to realize country they have done business with for decades murders people at will. Must have missed that 9/11 thing.
522 2018-10-21 22:45:12 Witch hazel and tea tree oil should help but it takes a while but the scars fade if you keep using it continuously
523 2018-10-21 22:45:10 That's the Power of oil owners!
524 2018-10-21 22:45:02 I know about the lies. And I know there's plenty of oil in the ground. I just didn't know it's renewable. 

Climate change is real. It's just not man made. The average global temperature rises and falls naturally. It's been linked to sunspot activity, by honest scientists.
525 2018-10-21 22:44:35 Their control on oil? Explain that one please...

529 2018-10-21 22:44:10 Is the VP the president? 

Where is the president? If its sucking oil from Bayelsa he will be vigilant.

To move about and asses their needs, you won't see him.

530 2018-10-21 22:44:05 Bull sheet , you don't even want to know what's happened , you want more Oil , I'm not defending any party , but I'm defining what's happening !
531 2018-10-21 22:43:54 So far the eco black castor oil one works for me
532 2018-10-21 22:43:52 Just burnt my whole hand so fucking bad with boiling oil and I’m home alone so fuck knows what am gonna do.
533 2018-10-21 22:43:50 do you use the oil absorbing wipes from clean and clear? they’re so nice i love them
534 2018-10-21 22:43:41 i’ve covered my hair in coconut oil and what a mistake.. gonna take about a week to wash this shite out
535 2018-10-21 22:43:36 It would be wonderful, and it's necessary, that the monarchy of the Saud be expelled.  Is inadmissible when they isolate and bomb an already poor country like Yemen or finance terrorism in Syria. Those damn cameleers believe they own the region; mentally retarded who swim in oil.
536 2018-10-21 22:43:36 Not sure why, no one seems to address that. If that is the case, oil prices will spike. The administration afraid to admit that ahead of mid term elections.
537 2018-10-21 22:43:31 Ontario is bad , come move to Western Land of the Oil and Fat hillbillies with hot wifes
538 2018-10-21 22:43:24 Tf was that oil slop in that baking pan 
539 2018-10-21 22:43:15 So let me get this right, you oppose an arms deal when they are getting 100 times the military firepower from the US and yet you are willing to buy Saudi Oil at market price for Eastern Canada. Check yourself at the door and try an win a seat before putting on the big boy pants.
540 2018-10-21 22:43:09 @Sir_David_King once attributed much of Italy’s debt to the rising cost of oil in the early 21c, I think he wrote it up as part of a paper on the inelastic price of oil, driven by costs of unconventional oil extraction; have you come across it?
541 2018-10-21 22:42:45 You don't trick me, that guys has wheels, or oil, or air, or an anti gravity device under his soles...
542 2018-10-21 22:42:32 Indeed, Oil execs are generally considered the moral arbitrators of society

553 2018-10-21 22:41:36 trying to get my oil changed at jiffy lube is the biggest reminder that i am an inept adult
554 2018-10-21 22:41:28 Waiting on MbS too lose his patience with everybody and scream: "You know what? I did it. He was talkin' some shit, so I chopped him up with a bone saw. Are you happy now? Try to punish me and oil prices will be $500/bbl. I hate you people."
555 2018-10-21 22:41:13 Certainly shouldn't focus only on electric. Hydrogen promising, but very expensive to isolate and difficult to handle.

Getting away from oil producers, whether via hydrogen, electric or something else has to be the goal.

Tesla's new battery factory is exciting as slashes costs.

557 2018-10-21 22:41:06 He decided not to renew oil blocks licenses. 
All of a sudden all looters are ganging up against him....hope people understand !!!
558 2018-10-21 22:41:02 Because our dumbshit president pulled out of the Iran deal making it "necessary" to stay friendly with the Saudis in order to keep the oil flowing.  Had we continued Obama's trajectory toward oil independence we could truly hold the Saudis accountable for their crimes.
559 2018-10-21 22:40:52 I don't agree with you about the corruption part. There are global events that are dragging the economy down, fed rate hikes, rising oil prices and such.
560 2018-10-21 22:40:46 Now we’re cooking with peanut oil!
561 2018-10-21 22:40:43 The only pieces I’ve seen are regurgitated talking points that have no basis in current facts. The oil, or the stabilization of the ME, which neither is true.
562 2018-10-21 22:40:43 It’s still kinda unknown but I think I might be cause whenever I use coconut oil I break out all over.
563 2018-10-21 22:40:32 Give it up barbie. Andrew will get our oil to market, get people working, get the economy back on the rails, get oil off the rails and into pipelines, strengthen our borders, jail jihadists, make Canadians feel safe again, take the vote away from non citizens and fix what U broke
564 2018-10-21 22:40:31 We will line up all the oil rigs in front of a trench and shoot them til dead
565 2018-10-21 22:40:29 You REALLY nd to check YOUR "facts".
Gas prices are not zooming, & the deficit did NOT increase by $779 billion.
Gas prices will go down.
We are now the #1 gas & oil producer in the world.
Many benefits of the tax cuts won't be realized until people file their 2018 income taxes.

567 2018-10-21 22:40:26 trump and Jared ordered it to cover up their crimes, Khashoggi was messing  up their Mideastern strategy, of stealing from everyone to enrich trump  co. and russia was also involved in money and oil and nuclear and land  grab from Palestine and wars for all the wealth in ME
568 2018-10-21 22:40:20 I take CBD oil every day for an injury suffered in a car accident. It’s not a magic bullet for me, but at least it keeps me from taking painkillers constantly.
569 2018-10-21 22:40:19 So I’ve been trying out a new evening skincare regimen (charcoal cleanser, witch hazel and tea tree serum, rosehip oil mixed with night cream) and my skin has been petal-perfect for about a month. This week I’m getting these bumpy, extremely deep-rooted spots on my cheeks. Help?
570 2018-10-21 22:40:18 I’m holding out for the Bannon dinner deal that’ll be on @Groupon later this week. Probably will include an oil change or a massage.
571 2018-10-21 22:40:16 The head coach, Rowboat Ron Rivera, once benched their future Hall of Fame QB for not wearing a tie.

Guarantee he does exactly nothing about the sideshow created by this underachieving liability in coverage.
572 2018-10-21 22:40:16 lmfao the oil in my hair is dripping down my neck at work. I’m dead.

575 2018-10-21 22:39:39 おはようございます。睡眠時間が短かったりすると寝たのに寝た気分にならないですよね。
576 2018-10-21 22:39:28 I.E. Saudia Arabia can do whatever they like as they control the oil.
577 2018-10-21 22:39:23 5 minutes ago, I was craving Asun. 

Now, it is soft yam and salted palm oil 
578 2018-10-21 22:39:22 كل تبن
579 2018-10-21 22:39:15 Look into CBD oil, comes from the hemp plant but has no traces of thc. Will make the transition a lot easier.
580 2018-10-21 22:38:58 they can not touch the oil,it's the important source to fund the government, Saudi Government laying as they deny Jamal killing
581 2018-10-21 22:38:51 Lubricated away with oil seems to work.
582 2018-10-21 22:38:51 I draw my conclusions based on 15 years of watching and writing about oil markets, including all factors...
583 2018-10-21 22:38:04 Once he put that lid back on that hot pot of oil, I knew it was over. You never put a lid on things you’re fying. Dude had a death wish!
584 2018-10-21 22:37:54 If only I could find a comfortable holster for it. 
585 2018-10-21 22:37:46 Because the US refuses to REOPEN the refineries that would change OIL to gas and keep prices low.  WE export the Oil to Saudi Arabia to be refined and then brought back to the US.
586 2018-10-21 22:37:43 And you think the GOP aren't corrupt as well by taking donor money from big pharma, military contractors and big oil?
587 2018-10-21 22:37:39 Spray a combo of peppermint oil, water, and a couple drops of soap in all the nooks and crannies of your room/ the door.
588 2018-10-21 22:37:31 @realDonaldTrump all you care about is oil and money and not about Justice and honesty and morality. You are disgusting. You also need to apologize to every child and parent for your name calling. You are not one to look up to and that's pathetic
589 2018-10-21 22:37:13 Haha Tim, the US has supported Saudi for decades so we could have cheap oil instead of developing alternative energy sources. You made your bed; now everyone gets to sleep in the filthy sheets you and your corrupt compatriots are leaving behind.
590 2018-10-21 22:37:09 I heard the other day a friend had joined a ICO investment group. She explained too me with the utmost conviction that the leader of this group had made so much money from ICO’s that she now wants too ‘help’ others do the same. Bitconnect/Snake oil still on every corner

594 2018-10-21 22:36:55 For breakfast, tasteless eggs fried without any butter or oil; soggy toast wt awful tasting, watery, meltless diet margarine; old hot Mexican sausage links wt waxen rancid fat; or old bacon....pastries, daily, also at lunch, and sometimes, dinner.
595 2018-10-21 22:36:48 The issue with being a deeply flawed mess is that people say 'the only person who can fix what's wrong is you'.

Christ, don't ask me to make me better. That's like saying 'You know the only thing that can help the wildlife from this oil spill?! Another injured bird!'
596 2018-10-21 22:36:43 You don't want to stop the flames...you want to be in the country that has the power to spread them and thereby increase its power, wealth and control. You gave yourself away when you brought up 'our way of life' and the 'flow of oil'!
597 2018-10-21 22:36:41 I've never heard of the public demanding palm oil. Food processors often aim to put it in our food, without even labelling it as such. It's often just labelled as vegetable oil.
598 2018-10-21 22:36:27 アクションゲーやるとめっちゃ疲れる様になってるしキンハIIIやれんのかな
599 2018-10-21 22:36:26 I got a foot/leg scrub, oil & hot stone massage. This is the best pedicure I’ve ever had in my life omg
600 2018-10-21 22:36:23 Tin foil on cookie sheet, olive oil and lemon juice, not too terrible
601 2018-10-21 22:35:56 I love CBD oil......so much......I feel like how people are supposed to usually feel for the first time in god knows how long
602 2018-10-21 22:35:37 Que oil is iilegal so I spared them and stayed with the juices sis 
603 2018-10-21 22:35:35 Can’t build a pipeline but spending daddy & grandaddys Oil derived fortune. What an a$$ hole.

606 2018-10-21 22:35:09 I need a hot oil treatment in ma hair 
607 2018-10-21 22:35:04 Last year Saudi accounted for just 9% of the 60% of USA oil consumption covered by imports. 

If we cut down on exporting, we can tell KSA to go fuck itself and stop buying their oil, with minimal disruption. 

While we’re at it, let’s stop arming them.
608 2018-10-21 22:34:56 (Contd) i entered research mode on google to dind the natural, God made plant or animal that this oil could be extracted from, i found NONE.

She offered me “itowo”, i said haba, no o...the real deal is having money and buying my own. I ran away, blocked and unfollowed her.
609 2018-10-21 22:34:54 CBD OIL is amazing for inflammation (arthritis) however don’t discount the medical benefits of THC which is great for pain. Just don’t take too much. For example you can a have a glass of wine or a drink of whiskey or you can drink the whole bottle.
610 2018-10-21 22:34:51 Wanna feel like money for a few minutes?

Listen to some Rick Ross

Oyster Perpetual, Oil Money, Geechi Liberachi, Amsterdam, then finish with Santorini Greece
611 2018-10-21 22:34:50 Tout à fait! Between dumping a bag of baby carrots in the pot because "the recipe calls for carrots" and drowning it with a half bottle of olive oil, and the other sautéing raw potatoes and, hence, carbonating the onions and the potatoes never cooking, I'd say *a big, fat NO*. 
612 2018-10-21 22:34:45 So educated whites didn’t buy the snake oil.
613 2018-10-21 22:34:29 We could stop spending the $2Billion every year to buy crude from #SaudiArabia and then start to get our own oil to Tidewater.

Isn’t this a perfect opportunity to change?
614 2018-10-21 22:34:25 Naa... Still got mad love for Palm oil rice with fish, kpomo and vegetable.
615 2018-10-21 22:34:21 Oil ya dummy.
616 2018-10-21 22:34:05 Let that barbaric regime keep the 10% of oil they supply to the US. It's pure greed and corruption with those politicians, and when they bombed the WTC, they should've been treated as enemies, not allies of the USA.
617 2018-10-21 22:33:57 The car is all washed up. I the oil is changed in the truck
618 2018-10-21 22:33:43 Steady...... oil could get expensive is you push to hard on this issue !
619 2018-10-21 22:33:42 Mmm borscht, pickled carrots, carrot loaf, and if all else fails puree, freeze and use in muffins, cakes or my fav beet pancakes. Sauteing greens with garlic and butter/oil combo and freezing in icecube trays to add a little something extra to sauces or soups.
620 2018-10-21 22:33:31 I ATE ALL THE CHILI OIL! _:(´ཀ`」 ∠):_
621 2018-10-21 22:33:24 Tropical rainforests used to cover 12% of the earth. Now they cover only 5% and are rapidly disappearing. Protecting and restoring rainforests is vital to sequestering harmful carbon from the atmosphere. Look into products that harm rainforests, such as palm oil (snack foods).
622 2018-10-21 22:33:23 Any argon oil product!
623 2018-10-21 22:33:23 Asbestos lips and fire-retardant beard oil.

627 2018-10-21 22:32:27 recalling the olive oil cake at amis fondly. to go or nah...
628 2018-10-21 22:32:24 It's the stupid idea of KSA been so indispensable to US that gives them the impetus to engage in all these deprave and horrendous acts. KSA is dispensable. Oil isn't supreme anymore. And more than anything, they shld worry about Iran and not the US.
629 2018-10-21 22:32:06 さむい

631 2018-10-21 22:31:54 It's not just the murder! They are refusing to supply oil so gas prices can go down. At least that's the Administration's line.
632 2018-10-21 22:31:54 I just want some truffle oil for my grilled cheese
633 2018-10-21 22:31:52 I have answered the question, you just don't like my answer. Because it does not fit your view of the world. I didn't insult you I stated facts you went to Tory conference and you sat down with those you have most in common with. The oil and gas lobby and the Tories.
634 2018-10-21 22:31:52 and u tried to get me to get face oil smh sabotage.
635 2018-10-21 22:31:47 God bless you. Now it’s blue eyed pendant that’s reigning sef. It’s amazing the length, breadth and depth some women go.

I know a lady that sells, the prices ehn...she told me of one oil i can rub on my chest that will make man stick to me like chewing gum.
636 2018-10-21 22:31:35 IT'S OIL CHANGE TIME WHERE MY OIL CHANGE BUDDY AT??
637 2018-10-21 22:31:23 Um have you had them roasted with some olive oil and kosher salt and pepper? So, so yummy.
638 2018-10-21 22:31:19 Hard working oil patch workers deserve better!
639 2018-10-21 22:31:02 How fortuitous! I had the old motor oil changed today!
640 2018-10-21 22:30:48   let's pity somebodys child please
641 2018-10-21 22:30:44 We're not really anymore though, not so much we need the Saudis at least. Part of the reason Venezuela went so pear shaped was the Saudis selling their oil at unsustainable rates and prices to bankrupt US oil interests. Fuel and oil tech made us less reliant.
642 2018-10-21 22:30:43 Or the east coast. Apparently Saudi oil has no environmental impact
643 2018-10-21 22:30:43 They were camel herders no more than 50 years ago and now have the nerve to speak with pomp and arrogance as if their oil wealth gives them superiority in all manner. May Allah swt hold this hypocrite along with his cohorts to account in this life and the next InshaAllah
644 2018-10-21 22:30:38 Got an oil change yesterday and now my engine light is on... wtf

Just read about it's raspberry plant stem cell technology and Himalayan Gentian extract - my skin glows the next day!!
654 2018-10-21 22:28:29 CBD oil
655 2018-10-21 22:28:17 Saving workers jobs in the oil and gas industry is like re-arranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. However those affected should be supported in every way to mitigate impacts and helped into the newly created jobs. We both know Coal mining was a different thing all together.
656 2018-10-21 22:28:16 This won't be business as usual. The West is not stupid. We have seen the moves MBS has been making, especially with Russia re;  Oil production & pricing. There are many other issues, but the Khashoggi murder is the straw that broke the camel's back
657 2018-10-21 22:28:16 The "Proud Boys" are a circle jerk cult, desperate to impress each other and their failed metrosexual hipster leader. That human bottle of expensive mustache oil personally confirmed that they are *required* to start fights.
658 2018-10-21 22:27:51 wind, solar energy, ocean, hydroelectric....fuel efficiency through AI, electric vehicles.....takes us into the future, not the past. We no longer use whale oil as fuel........there is no going back, and no need, desire to do so.....cleaner fuels are the future

660 2018-10-21 22:27:26 He ain’t shit, I would’ve changed your oil too lmao
661 2018-10-21 22:27:17 Did you know that if you put olive oil in a hot pan & let it sit too long it will CATCH THE FUCK ON FIRE? Just learned that one the hard way.
662 2018-10-21 22:27:15 But don’t we use oil to fuel many of our power generators, which produce the electricity to recharge the cars?. I would very much like to see end of burning fossil fuels as well, but we have long way to go
663 2018-10-21 22:27:07 @Shell boycott all shell stations until Chula Vista Shell sells gasoline to US Border patrol. If this has been corrected, well still boycott to prove a point. Support USA oil companies, Exxon Mobil, etc.
664 2018-10-21 22:27:05 I'm not going to sleep because of Rafael #Kubelik in my #BeethovenOdyssey right now, but I wouldn't be surprised if this has me burning the midnight oil soon.
665 2018-10-21 22:26:57 I have the same scare from a horseback riding accident 5 years ago got bucked and fall right on my face, ripped my upper lip off.  I did a lot of myofacial therapy to breakup the scare tissues and emu oil/vitamin e oil.
666 2018-10-21 22:26:43 It would be a sad commentary on the intelligence of the voters if they vote for Trudeau after the beating he has given our economy, the oil industry, our debt, our deficits, our immigration, our foreign investment, and our small business. But, on the bright side, we can get high.
667 2018-10-21 22:26:16 Sunday food so far:

Pasta with freshly grated cheese and parsley 
Sautéed kale and carrots with pepper, garlic, lemon juice and olive oil. 
More water.

670 2018-10-21 22:25:59 As long as markets are down oil will keep drop m, when markets rebound oil will rally, demand drop with the markets
671 2018-10-21 22:25:58 That would be difficult. USG approved a Colt manufacturing plant there several years ago. They can make their own rifles.
Long term, stop putting our noses where they don't belong? Hard to do when we are dependent on foreign govts for oil, etc
672 2018-10-21 22:25:54 If u know what oil contributed to GDP. U will never blame fall in oil price or looting for the recession. Greece had a recession where they looting there too?
673 2018-10-21 22:25:51 -put almond oil on your chapped lips
-use beeswax balm

676 2018-10-21 22:25:19 @Saudi_Gazette #SaudiArabia, oh just lying lying fucking scum, just scum, the laughable banana republic with oil.
Didn't think any one could make Trump look good, but Clown Prince Rectard nailed it
677 2018-10-21 22:25:13 I hate the oil capsules shit makes me too relaxed I hate feeling weighed down
678 2018-10-21 22:24:59 Red oil? Is this future husband an idol? 
679 2018-10-21 22:24:58 Not one mention of the 80,000 barrels of oil Canada buys on a daily basis from Saudi. Build Energy East FFS and drop the dirty oil imports into eastern Canada. Many times this panel appears dumber than a bag of hammers.
680 2018-10-21 22:24:56 #MBS will be severely punished
He will be forced to watch @realDonaldTrump
 rallies,endlessly
#USSanctions will include MBS paying way over market for Trump and Kushner properties,lowering the price of oil shipped to any Trump property,and teaching #Trump how to silence #Media
681 2018-10-21 22:24:51 As you live with the oil and muslims pilgrames money , you can not understand the people who work. Sherif huseyin died with tears of regret after rebelling to the ottomans you ll see the same end
682 2018-10-21 22:24:36 Beware of implying that is "our" insatiable appetite for palm oil. It is being imposed on us by those who aim to profit from it. It is not in the name of the people, it is imposed upon them. The public do not demand palm oil.
683 2018-10-21 22:24:26 I used hot soapy water. Baby wipes. I got most of it off with the take the day off oil by Clinique.
684 2018-10-21 22:24:06 I mean... it’s a break from coconut oil at least
685 2018-10-21 22:24:06 Such a good guy. Willing to hold someone else's beer. 
686 2018-10-21 22:24:05 Use virgin olive oil or coconut oil, chopsticks never worked good with me like the natural oils
687 2018-10-21 22:23:55 and water is cheaper than oil per the gallon.
688 2018-10-21 22:23:32 Me?
A pot of tea in the morning. Maybe one coffee, at a friends house, in the afternoon. Lots of water throughout the day. No booze, as I stumble and fall enough. CBD oil under my tongue, at bedtime, to alleviate some pain and help me sleep.
Wake up.......repeat.

689 2018-10-21 22:23:31 I meant my truck needs an oil change.
690 2018-10-21 22:23:31 If you insist my lady *rubs back with olive oil*.
691 2018-10-21 22:23:11 wait, YOUR party houses the neo nazis and white supremacists and WE are the savages? Thats a laugh lady. Deficit running to record highs and oil and gas companies allowed to destroy are air? Thats pretty savage dear. Get a clue

under the actual ruler is acting more and more as a rogue state.
Where does the surprise come from?
694 2018-10-21 22:22:54 I'm just glad I can finally use my bergamot oil. I tried using it in soap and turns out it's a skin irritant.
695 2018-10-21 22:22:27 حسبنا الله ونعم الوكيل .
696 2018-10-21 22:22:25 1900s were a blast. Tell you what, let's do everything we can to kickstart the Great Depression, Saudi Oil crisis, the Arab Israel war, Korean War, and why not now the Cold War while we are at it.  Because escalation of nuclear proliferation is the way forward... #trump #retro
697 2018-10-21 22:22:24 I imagine something amazing. Being that Uganda is yet to drill its oil, how bout that litre of fuel at only 300 shillings. My gut tells me the economy will triple double. And income amongst Ugandans would increase and hence improved standards of living. What would be the price of
698 2018-10-21 22:22:11 Oil your own machine.....!
699 2018-10-21 22:22:08 It's "just okay" but I'm very hungry, so. 

Also, I eat french fries fried in peanut oil so I feel like this is kinda the same thing if I simmer the fuck out of the sauce. Maybe.
700 2018-10-21 22:22:01 My interest in electric vehicles is to remove our dependence on Saudi and others like them for energy.

A world where we don't need much oil is one where we can call out the Saudis for their disgusting behaviour in the Yemen, and even their own embassies it would seem.
701 2018-10-21 22:21:59 Depende do que diga a "Literatura Jurídica" Thanks for your oil

705 2018-10-21 22:21:45 Yeah, sort of, but in effect the replacements system assumes that you need more metal than oil to "fuel" tank movements.

It's even worse at sea where fleets steam for free.

712 2018-10-21 22:21:00 Know why?
It has always been lubricated with oil. 
Where was the outrage 8 years ago? Saudi dictatorship been beheading people for a long time. 
Suddenly Jake Tapper is concerned.
713 2018-10-21 22:20:51 Really...righteous on arms sales! We buy oil from them everyday at the expense of jobs out west and the Canadian economy but zero mention of that! Pathetic....
714 2018-10-21 22:20:47 I do wonder why Ian Wood is in both the oil and the fishing industries when they do so badly, or so he keeps telling us. 
715 2018-10-21 22:20:40 Love it! And thank you, I even was recognized by my bosses for my work at the oil company! It was nice.. And I enjoyed meeting people I don't get to see since I work from home!
716 2018-10-21 22:20:38 The U.S. is a bigger oil producer than KSM.  All we’d have to do is go more for renewable energy and conserve a bit, and we wouldn’t miss House Of Saud at all.  They’d sure miss US, though.

Nothing to do with Westminster mismanagement...
722 2018-10-21 22:19:41 Checkmate on move 2?  Try again...

Gasoline prices have been rising fairly steadily since late 2016 when OPEC decided to curb its oil production. Experts say that is the main driver of rising prices, though there are others outside Trump’s control as well.

730 2018-10-21 22:18:48 @HumbleMechanic Hi I have an oil leak. It's not coming from sump plug or oil filter. Any tips on best way to find the leak? I assume it's probably valve cover gasket or sump gasket. Maybe both. Thanks for any help you can give.

733 2018-10-21 22:18:36 SA has never been anything more than an ally of convenience because  of our previous dependence on their oil.
734 2018-10-21 22:18:35 how’d you get oil stains on your car? Like interior?
735 2018-10-21 22:18:29 Lol u clearly have no idea what role US is currently playing in #Syria if u genuinely believe that ur #trump destroyed #ISIS  #naive
There are thousands of #US military personnel presently(on & off record) in Syria,& let me assure u;they are not there to save civilians. #oil
736 2018-10-21 22:18:27 {Part 3} Iraq is rich in oil yes so dominating it is logical. But the rest no. Syria had bearley enough oil to break even pre war. Gaza Lebanon and Yemen have no significant natural resources of value. It's just a waste of the Irans money for no good reason.
737 2018-10-21 22:18:21  Never heard of anyone doing this before. Only olive oil for me.
738 2018-10-21 22:18:18 coconut castor olive oil mix together and use for hair growth. Wash it at least every two weeks.

740 2018-10-21 22:18:03 That in turn causes major problems in Europe and Asia who's way of life depends on this oil. Will these countries in Europe and Asia sit back and let that happen, will it then force our hand or the Chinese hand to intervene. Yes
741 2018-10-21 22:17:55 I hope the revolution does spread. All the tyrants need to be overthrown. But now we're getting to the *real* issue that I knew this was all about for you...your own self interests. I want the flow of oil to stop. This is what our disagreement is really about.
742 2018-10-21 22:17:47 i nearly blinded myself with castor oil im just. gonna go ahead and blame it on the fascists
743 2018-10-21 22:17:46 Are fruits and chocolate from @FairTradeCert sources?

Is Palm Oil used and what’s the source?
744 2018-10-21 22:17:43 And what’s their evidence for choosing 30,000 or 40,000 years ago? Fossils? Laughable. Oil and coal deposits? The age of rocks? Please.

747 2018-10-21 22:17:25 It's always about oil imo, Saudi nations have it, rest of the world wants it. 
Because their own oils fields are starting to run dry.

756 2018-10-21 22:15:41 If it's wrapped in bacon the oil is surplus to requirements
757 2018-10-21 22:15:31 That's just electricity generation. They still use oil for transportation, are you going to convert all the worlds container ships to electric? What about trains? Electric trains work in cities but not cross country. What about jet fuel? Cant convert planes to electric.
758 2018-10-21 22:15:28 (Continued) then what chance do the mullahs have fighting and financing war in Syria and throwing billions at militants in Gaza Lebanon Yemen and Iraq? At least the USSR put money into holding resource rich places like Angola which is rich in diamonds and oil. (Continued below).

761 2018-10-21 22:15:07 @FoxNews PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO WALK ON THIS PLANET.  why are republicans talking about people who are not in this country ? if every migrant had oil ? they would be welcomes like the JOURNALIST FROM AMERICA AT SAUDIA ARABIA CONSULATE. IF HILLARY WAS A JOURNALIST WHAT WOULD TRUMP
762 2018-10-21 22:14:50 I never said anything about talking Saudi Arabia..... but now you are following my line of thought. Say a civil war erupts, will it stay contained to SA, no as it would spread to Quater and Barain. Oil flow stops due to civil war.
763 2018-10-21 22:14:45 That is main reason. Oil is secondary so they can fund illegal wars in MENA. Saudis r their piggy bank
764 2018-10-21 22:14:44 Are you really shocked at the brutality of the Saudis?  They have never pretended to be a democracy. They like us because they live in a bad neighborhood. We like them because they have oil, cash and serve to counter Iran.   Did you think something different?  Flush the pretense.
765 2018-10-21 22:14:44 So this would potentially be a policy of mass employment for anyone currently working in the Oil and Gas Industry? No Just Transition Just total oblivion vis a vis Coal Mining?
766 2018-10-21 22:14:37 I like. Lol hair really needs oil. And her toes coming out like that from the shoes is not cute. But I like the dress.

787 2018-10-21 22:12:18 damn straight, we should get those pipelines shovel ready tomorrow so zoolander and freelander can go tell SA to stuff thier dirty oil, we are an oil rich country. Shame on them for buying oil from human rights abusers! Hypocrites

790 2018-10-21 22:11:55 The Bro Self Help movement is an amazing phenomenon. Dudes who consider themselves super-rational, rugged individualists falling for the snake oil offered up by the likes of Jordan Peterson, and, in doing so, utterly debasing themselves like any other cultist.
791 2018-10-21 22:11:43 he means checks in exchange for oil, and balances of the ledgers
792 2018-10-21 22:11:41 Ask them if they can post the cost of an oil change for a 2nd Generation Roadster that is quicker than the Bugatti 
793 2018-10-21 22:11:39 I believe they will try to save the oil industry by sanctioning other countries which could artificially postpone a rapid decline in oil. Probably won't work to spike oil, but will be an economic headwind if prices don't decline significantly
794 2018-10-21 22:11:36 We can also tax all wire transfers originating from the US going to Mexico. Wire transfers coming from the US recently surpassed oil revenues as Mexico's largest source of income.

815 2018-10-21 22:08:29 What is "Oil" ?
816 2018-10-21 22:08:28 I think you’ve stretched this rather odd Sissors analogy now.  there’s a reason we can’t “let these folks just use oil and H2”, and that is that both (mainly oil !!), are inefficient processes and using more Carbon. We need to urgently cut wherever we can as #climatechange

825 2018-10-21 22:07:32 One side is deeply concerned over our planet's survival and 3% are paid by big oil to distort the facts
826 2018-10-21 22:07:27 The bottle is accurate. I don't think I have come across a pure CBD oil unless it's from Hemp. Oils from all LP's have a small % of Thc, but it's very minimal to the point that you won't have a feeling of 'high'
827 2018-10-21 22:07:20 Gee, another Repugnant in the Oval Office and once again, gas prices are up 29.8%?!  Could it have anything to do w/oil producing nations knowing they can get away with gouging us?  With the hostility toward renewable fuel sources (solar, wind, +), lowered mileage standards?

829 2018-10-21 22:07:10 In what's probably Peak Desi behavior, whenever I grease my baking sheet with olive oil, I rub the excess into my hands.  Why waste it, right?
830 2018-10-21 22:07:01 1- trump calls Saudi king asking for an increase in oil production
2- king refused proposal or order 
3- trump makes a speech at a rally saying Saudis would not survive two weeks without US protection
4-MBS fires back that Saudis 'will not pay one dollar for protection
831 2018-10-21 22:07:00 Kale chips are great. You just roast them in olive oil salt and pepper.
832 2018-10-21 22:06:57 Reading comprehension a little low with some folks? How do you not get that this is a reference to nonsense spouted by snake oil purveyors? Especially given the source of the tweet. Wow, humans are not that bright.
833 2018-10-21 22:06:51 I should oil my motorcycle... #MinkBot
834 2018-10-21 22:06:39 Tangina gusto ko bumili ng oil pastel tapos yung ano basta
835 2018-10-21 22:06:30 Saudis have never been allies, they've been clients. They bought our weapons & we bought their oil.
836 2018-10-21 22:06:25 @Yates_Doug if you don't mind me asking what motor oil do y'all run in @roushyates engines
837 2018-10-21 22:06:21 Walter, the Saudis will do ANYTHING to steal the Yemenis' vast oil reserves, including genocide. When will the American press report on this motivation?
838 2018-10-21 22:06:17 Some saying oil is going to march towards 100.
839 2018-10-21 22:06:11 Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, love will cease to remain.
A jam!
840 2018-10-21 22:06:08 This is not the time , For your Oil rant either. Again other Nations are involved. Stay focused on the Real issues , and maybe there will be a solution.
841 2018-10-21 22:05:57 There are only two reasons why we are allies with these cut-throats:
Oil and arms.
842 2018-10-21 22:05:51 It’s been an hour and that nasty ass oil isn’t wORKING AND I KINDA JUST REALIZED THAT SWALLOWING A TEASPOON OF PURE OIL PROLLY HAS A TON OF CALORIES WHY DID I DO THAT
843 2018-10-21 22:05:50 I don't think Ethiopian oil is big enough to compete with theirs and bother them that much. This is our internal issue we need to solve by ourselves. So pls don't blame others for once, lets work on our issues by ourselves
844 2018-10-21 22:05:36 風邪のまま迎えた月曜日いいい
845 2018-10-21 22:05:28 Paracetamol. Clove oil. Soluble asprin mouth washes.
846 2018-10-21 22:05:18 @Honda just read that certain CRVs have a problem with gas leaking into the oil. Can you please tell me more?
Thank you,
847 2018-10-21 22:05:09 I just did this today.  Cut it in strips and marinade it for several hours in teriyaki sauce, green onions and some garlic salt (that's just what i had around here to use).  Pour the liquid off and put some oil and butter in a pan on the stove like you're making pancakes.
848 2018-10-21 22:05:08 At valvoline getting my oil changed is getting my anxiety worked up because people are working and I am not
849 2018-10-21 22:05:02 Your hair care regiment must include a natural Hair Oil like the Reshma Henna Infused Hair Oil for Thinning Hair. It also has a blend of other nourishing oils like Basil, Cedar Wood, Olive and Jojoba. #hairoil #naturalhair #naturalhairoil #oilmassage
850 2018-10-21 22:04:59 Heartbreaking. All for cheap palm oil. It’s not even good for you.
851 2018-10-21 22:04:51 Bio oil worked for me babe! Mine were dark just on my hips and they’re completely gone now! Nothing wrong with tiger marks! Xx
852 2018-10-21 22:04:28 Yep stupid. So many people got really bad splash burns from the oil. Me included.
853 2018-10-21 22:04:24 Americans don’t care. Only Darcy and  journalists care cuz one of their own killed. Such indignation. How dare liberal activism is met with consequences. Stop the world, stop trade, increase oil prices! War with SA!
#EnemyOfThePeople
854 2018-10-21 22:04:20 Solar panels, wind turbines, and tidal turbines are flashy toys? How is it any more expensive than oil and its related damages? Cost is even going down while efficiency increases. RE100 companies are turning more profit. So you go ahead and advocate baby steps. I refuse.
855 2018-10-21 22:04:20 Sure they have to rally around their prince, because they can't do otherwise.  The herd in #SaudiArabia is numbed by religion and their family rulers are pocketing $billions from the oil in the #US and #UK banks.  What a great nation
856 2018-10-21 22:04:15 Yes, big oil may be the greatest threat to this planet. Our children may be wittness to the single worst catastrophe in human existence.For the sake of profits oil is ignoring science and condemning our children to horrible deaths that are preventable if we would only b serious..
857 2018-10-21 22:04:12 The problem you have here Robert is Kellogg's is an American company and the mere mention of oil...………………….well I think you get where I'm going.
858 2018-10-21 22:04:06 I came Upstate to visit family and get some reprieve from the craziness of NYC life. I have 3-jobs, FT organizing, and 2-partners (poly life). Just wanted to slow down... Instead, my Grandmother's talking how I have to take the car for an oil change and about her will. 
859 2018-10-21 22:04:02 How about using drones to find multiple renewable energy sites and leaving the oil in the ground? Seriously.
860 2018-10-21 22:03:52 So I would recommend downloading the free @plugshare app and typing in any post codes or cities had in mind, although there are few patches in Wales / East Anglia eg. , vast majority of UK has very good coverage, not something oil companies or petrol car makers want u2 believe.
861 2018-10-21 22:03:44 Shut d fuck up, y u so dumb? U need d oil in ur brain
862 2018-10-21 22:03:41 Your country has oil too. Oh, I've forgotten...... sorry.
863 2018-10-21 22:03:37 It is the oil of God that give us joy so always keep the oil of God to us. If your oil runs out you need to refuel.
864 2018-10-21 22:03:33 gingko and fish oil are great for brain health.
865 2018-10-21 22:03:16 This year's Halloween challenge: no candy with palm oil, because orangutans. Thanks @DrBirute and @ForTheWild_ for cluing us in.
866 2018-10-21 22:03:00 oil city
867 2018-10-21 22:02:43 I've always known this, but this is the most satisfying expression of this obvious reality to anyone who has a brain that still works.

Nigeria will remain Nigeria for no less than 100 years to come. At least until the oil finishes. Simple and short! Gbam!! Insults continue below
868 2018-10-21 22:02:41 ALSO LOOK AT WHAT TYPE OF PAINT YOU ARE DOING!! WATERCOLOR?? ACRYLIC??? OIL BASED?? SKDKDK PAINTING CAN BE REALLY COMPLEX
869 2018-10-21 22:02:38 Update: taking CBD oil has helped quite a bit with some of the post chemo side effects, defo recommend #fyoucancer #chemohelp
870 2018-10-21 22:02:37 oil can harry: smesh
871 2018-10-21 22:02:35 My old man swears there was a place in Italy where the waiters mixed the olive oil and balsamic in their mouths in front of the diners before dressing the salad.
872 2018-10-21 22:02:32 1. Whisk together 1 can pumpkin purée with 4 eggs, a cup of olive or canola oil, 1/3 cup bourbon, 1tbsp vanilla extract, and 1/3 cup water. 
2. Brown 1 stick butter and stir into previous mixture.
873 2018-10-21 22:02:31 Nice but hubby slices them in half along with grape tomatoes, brushing with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, sprinkles Honey Hype on them and either grills them or roasts them in oven.  Pure heaven!
874 2018-10-21 22:02:23 what would be good baguette drizzle olive oil, dried herbs like dried oregano, dried thyme fresh cracked pepper and Kosher salt. omg that platter would be the bomb lol sorry love i love food
875 2018-10-21 22:02:22 Don't answer him,  he just wants to put oil inside your engine
876 2018-10-21 22:02:21 hahaha, When I was 17 years old I worked at Jack In The Box. We had that probably almost on a daily basis. It was so stupid, we had to take frozen fries straight out of the freezer and put them into the boiling oil. Someone didn't think that through very well. 
877 2018-10-21 22:02:20 Tell Putin about POTUS annihilating 300 Russians & then mention how USA produced more oil than Russia for 1st x since 1999

Romney tried to warn y'all about the dangers of Putin but y'all LOL at 44's 1980s are calling

January 20,2025 is going to be a long miserable time for ya
878 2018-10-21 22:02:13 I am learning my business partner Curt Champ Anderson is blowing Naples, Florida up.  

Time to Augusta, Georgia up. The CBD Oil market is growing. Want to learn to more?
879 2018-10-21 22:02:11 Honestly I should hunt this article down cause I'm skeptical that anyone can drink even a gallon of oil without getting sick. 

A gallon of anything in one sitting is a big feat
880 2018-10-21 22:02:01 What happened to Khashoggi is horrible, but most media print stories that support their agenda...esp. when the incident is opportunity 2 target Trump.
Totally omit Trudeau's eagerness 2 buy Saudi oil over Canadian, sell them armoured vehicles, & protect fundamentalists with M103
881 2018-10-21 22:01:29 Same here. That olive oil is a fickle bitch and jumps out all willy nilly.

884 2018-10-21 22:01:16  You need to get your hand as close as possible to the oil

888 2018-10-21 22:00:50 I'll try to find one that's got no palm oil but that might be easier said than done.  Don't all the butter brands have it?
889 2018-10-21 22:00:46 The  NA n NAF need this tech fr active strike and surveillance
890 2018-10-21 22:00:46 KEEP THE OIL

892 2018-10-21 22:00:43 Not a fan of gels but I'll reach for the blue sport eco gel for braid outs and the castor oil one to slick my hair  back
893 2018-10-21 22:00:31 if you are a true Christian don't let the oil run out in you and keep your fire burning with God
894 2018-10-21 22:00:26 Yes it's always important to check yourself!! I highly recommend you use CBD oil and eat lots of fruits and veggies every day. Also stay hydrated with lots of spring water  Heal and rest up baby girl!!

897 2018-10-21 22:00:04 No.If oil price rise they can do it both.
898 2018-10-21 21:59:52 Do you even own a heavy coat?
Ugg boots
Your oil bill must be so low
899 2018-10-21 21:59:47 @nohbodrops Are there mint/spearmint/peppermint/menthol oil in the drops?  I want to order, but I have a severe allergy so I thought I'd check :)
900 2018-10-21 21:59:19 It’s the death of big oil. You saw what happened to Nantucket after the first oil wells.
901 2018-10-21 21:59:15 AC-130 gunship couldn’t hurt. 

902 2018-10-21 21:59:10 Oh, shoot, it's got palm oil.  I had to google it to find out.
903 2018-10-21 21:59:09 My Dad swears by his vanilla beard oil, usually. It does make him smell like a walking bakery at least, so that's something.
904 2018-10-21 21:59:06 It appears the previous deliveries of Squirrel Oil may not have been prepared with the freshest of game.  It is good to see the newest batch did it’s wondrous work

906 2018-10-21 21:58:52 It doesn't reflect well in pictures, but my eyeshadow, lipstick, and scrunchie were all that reflective oil slick type rainbow and so was the rest of my outfit.
907 2018-10-21 21:58:42 Iran asked for it, being all muslim and having oil and all.
908 2018-10-21 21:58:33 I can send you a recipe for a turmeric mask use that then when you wipe it off or wash it off moisture with a mixture of Shea butter and tea tree oil
909 2018-10-21 21:58:04 I would mark my calendar to see a rated r #Batman movie, and I don’t know the the day of anyone’s anything.
910 2018-10-21 21:57:59   we die here...  The first picture made my day..  
911 2018-10-21 21:57:59 In other news, today I realized I wasn’t feeling ill from decompressing after the school term like usual, I was overdosing on fish oil pills.

I couldn’t make that up if I tried.
912 2018-10-21 21:57:54 Whoa, I always buy their butter made with olive oil, but no more
#BoycottLandOLakes
913 2018-10-21 21:57:52 Lol how he does when he's about to slide a girls DM to lick some ass
914 2018-10-21 21:57:39 The worst part of being Puerto Rican is all your clothes smelling like cooking oil all the time
915 2018-10-21 21:57:37 Right.
The 401k that took it in the shorts last week because of you?  And will continue to decline as oil rises.  All because of your criminal activity with the Saudi ‘s.
916 2018-10-21 21:57:29 Got to third base with an industrial fryer. If I had anymore oil on me, I’d be invaded and occupied by the US military.
917 2018-10-21 21:57:28 Thank you for making people aware of this.  It’s heartbreaking and fundamentally wrong to destroy animals and their habitats for commercial greed.   Avoiding buying products containing palm oil and lobbying those companies using palm oil is something we should do.
918 2018-10-21 21:57:21 Yes thousands but cus they dont have oil like saudi. The question here is why the world just focusing on Mr. kashoughi case and ignoring Syria & rohingya prople??
919 2018-10-21 21:57:01 Pakistan's Saudi Arabia without oil and money. Cruelty, lack of human rights, misrepresentation of Koran are same. Instead of 5000 Saudi drone princes, Pakistan has feudal class mostly in PakMilitary use budget to promote terrorism and fancy lifestyle!!!
920 2018-10-21 21:56:59 “Relationship”? Say what you mean; It’s Money and oil. It’s a great gig; we build up Saudi weapons. Then naturally, Iran responds by building up theirs, and then we get to threaten Iran for making more weapons! #ingenious #Trump #ForeignPolicy #BlueWaveSaves
921 2018-10-21 21:56:58 Yes Irani regime is repressive, evil. But make no mistake. These are no genuine grassroots groups pushing for reform in Iran. These are mostly funded by western groups who for oil / Strategic Isareli policy want a submissive regime in Iran. Why nobody questions theocratic Saudis?
922 2018-10-21 21:56:46 But Cruz HAS been bought by Super PACs, corporations and Big Oil. I’m voting for a man who has EVERY Texan in mind for great things. He’s a positive force, while Canadian Cruz is mired in negativity and attack ads. I’m voting #BetoForSenate 
923 2018-10-21 21:56:44 skins....now all we need it a little chicken fat,olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, oregano and parsley on those bad boys!!
924 2018-10-21 21:56:43 Lol I covered my body with Lemon essential oil only to realize immediately after that it's not for skin use but for diffusion only.
925 2018-10-21 21:56:43 @FareedZakaria damn your $150 barrels of oil. Is this enough for you?
926 2018-10-21 21:56:41 おはようございます
今週も天気が良く秋晴れになりそうだなぁ
昨日は車の洗車とoil交換に行きたかったけど仕事道具を購入しに出掛けてたら行けなかった・・・
次回にしよう。
NSRにも乗れなかったなぁ！
さて、今日も安全に怪我や事故には十分気をつけてぼちぼちといこうね
927 2018-10-21 21:56:31 They'll Rob the American consumer to pay for the oil industry's junk bonds.
928 2018-10-21 21:56:27 あ、お昼寝(笑) どんだけ寝ても寝れちゃいますよね〜
わかるわかる。わかる。私もです。見せれないです。やばい。お掃除マン週に1回ぐらい欲しいです(自分でやれ)
そうそう！！！ いたずらしちゃうぞ的な！！！
んんん...丸山さんはなんかやっぱ、デレデレが全開なので妄想しやすいというか...(笑)
929 2018-10-21 21:56:27 So many products contain palm oil now as it's the cheapest alternative, I do check the labels and avoid buying products with the rubbish in
930 2018-10-21 21:56:25 Morality and capitalism mix like oil and vinegar
931 2018-10-21 21:56:12 Yes Irani regime is repressive, evil. But make no mistake. These are no genuine grassroots groups pushing for reform in Iran. These are mostly funded by western groups who for oil / Strategic Isareli policy want a submissive regime in Iran. Why nobody questions theocratic Saudis?
932 2018-10-21 21:56:07 Trump exchange America with Saudi oil
933 2018-10-21 21:55:56 Every time I think about trying out Amazon Fresh, I get freaked out by the idea of eating anything that comes out of their super-sketch-anything-goes global supply chain.

If all of their Apple earbuds are fake, how can I risk my health on a bottle of "olive oil?"
934 2018-10-21 21:55:53 My egg noodles are.... 2 egg yolks, 2 cups flour (more if needed) 2 Tbsp oil. Mix well, and let rest.   Use more flour to dust counter, and roll out and cut to what you like for noodles.. my house  LOVES BIG FAT ONES!!! I just don't get to enjoy that kind anymore.
935 2018-10-21 21:55:49 Yes Irani regime is repressive, evil. But make no mistake. These are no genuine grassroots groups pushing for reform in Iran. These are mostly funded by western groups who for oil / Strategic Isareli policy want a submissive regime in Iran. Why nobody questions theocratic Saudis?
936 2018-10-21 21:55:37 SAARSO KA OIL LAGA KE *APNA GHANJA PAN DHUR RAHE* XD
937 2018-10-21 21:55:35 Does it contain Palm Oil?
938 2018-10-21 21:55:05 it’s like even oil isn’t enough 
939 2018-10-21 21:55:02 The olive oil Eco gel and the black castor oil works for me. The ones with Argan oil flake alot
940 2018-10-21 21:55:02 Picked a good day to be at Lucas Oil today. Go Colts.
941 2018-10-21 21:54:50 Meanwhile don’t use our own oil
942 2018-10-21 21:54:47 By "interesting", do you mean moronic and desperate to shift the blame? Because I seem to recall that oil giants not only donated heavily to the GOP during that time, they were burying their own studies that supported man-made climate change. And let's not forget your own role.
943 2018-10-21 21:54:41 There is no palm oil in the ingredients 
944 2018-10-21 21:54:41 He wants to multiply cooking oil and sugar 
945 2018-10-21 21:54:35 The only reason Pence is where he is now is because he rode Trump's coattails. He's a snake oil salesman with the personality of cardboard. They're both liars, so I guess that does make them more relatable to the fan base. 
946 2018-10-21 21:54:28 In America it's usually called canola oil . . .
947 2018-10-21 21:53:47 I’ve just applied

Medicinal grade olive oil

Inside my ears

It’s to soften the impacted wax

I seem to produce an excessive amount

Of wax

Earwax 

Not medicinal grade olive oil

My ears were blasted almost clean

Last week

Second blast next week
948 2018-10-21 21:53:40 @HowardKurtz Dear Mr. Kurtz,  This week's program was SO WEAK as you and 2 of your guests were hellbent on blaming Trump when NOBODY gives a crap about an Islamic pal of Bin Laden's pretending to be a journalist got zapped by the Saudis whose oil we needed for so long.  Grow up!
949 2018-10-21 21:53:30 Slathering in Vaseline, baby oil gel and coconut oil
950 2018-10-21 21:53:09 Alright.  I need to take care of my goatee more and I'm looking for recommendations about what products I can use to keep it looking the best it can.  Oil?  Salve?  Let me know what you use or have heard is the best.

Go.
951 2018-10-21 21:53:09 For the West to look the other way and ignore it, background: Saudis uncooperative with oil prices, Trump insult them, MBS's misguided way of giving Trump and the US the finger?
952 2018-10-21 21:53:02 Because oil.
Because .
That's why.
953 2018-10-21 21:52:56 @dabiodunMFR cocoa, oil palm,cassava, kolanut and rubber are the oil of Ogun state. lets review plans to boom this sector please. sagamu- ikorodu, ijebu ode - epe expressway has been neglected for too long. lets decongest commercial activities in Lagos.
954 2018-10-21 21:52:52 Don't totally blame Buhari. The country entered recession last year because the previous govt didn't save much & managed the huge amount of money Nigeria made when the price of Crude oil was btw $100-$150/barrel. The int'l prices dropped to $41/barrel when Buhari came on board.
955 2018-10-21 21:52:50 Kind of disappointed she didn’t come back with Lac Megantique. US oil, hauled by a US railway, to a Canadian refinery.
956 2018-10-21 21:52:46 I get excited bout shit like Pure Rosehip Seed oil coming for me in the mail. 
957 2018-10-21 21:52:01 How to feel better when u sick 

-Drink alot of water!

-rest (sleep, stay at home)

-drink herbs tea

-drink olive Oil or est it with salads
958 2018-10-21 21:51:47 Oh yes, that's right. And they bomb small countries, and steal the oil from foreign nations who can't defend themselves.
959 2018-10-21 21:51:31 Make sure the oil in tray is piping hot and the batter will rise. Also don't open the oven door while it's cooking.
960 2018-10-21 21:51:19 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
961 2018-10-21 21:51:14 قبل عبالي فصيلة الدم تكون B او-B اوO و-O بس اكتشفت ان في diesel وoil هذيل اكثر شي اشوفهم 
962 2018-10-21 21:50:59 Must have slipped on all of that cooking oil
963 2018-10-21 21:50:57 The oil sands is being allowed to *increase* its emissions - they and all industries should have to cut back the same percentage as us ordinary folk.
964 2018-10-21 21:50:56 I guess Derrick got tired of my old braid down. He got a comb, water, moisturizer and oil and took my hair out 
965 2018-10-21 21:50:54 Not doing it now, Lyla, but used to use great amounts of lavender oil in the past! ... Always seemed to relax me just a little!! 
966 2018-10-21 21:50:52 And the US continuously goes backwards with more coal & oil. So shitty. 
967 2018-10-21 21:50:09 @Nestle also refuses to buy sustainable palm oil which protects habitats for orangutans and many other endangered animals.
968 2018-10-21 21:49:18 Iran has alot of oil too.

976 2018-10-21 21:48:48 Condemns? Haha that’s so laughable. All you have is empty words and nothing else. Keep getting their blood oil and keep sending them arms.
977 2018-10-21 21:48:39 Very generous indeed. Atiku we nor buy ur snake oil o. 
978 2018-10-21 21:48:23 There you go again with that “every” nonsense. You’re gravely mistaken. There’s literally soooo much evidence of a flood and the fossil “record”, oil and coal deposits all coming from the same event its hard for me to wrap my head around you not understanding.

981 2018-10-21 21:48:15 Do you think cbd oil is effective for these also?
982 2018-10-21 21:47:57 Saudi Arabia is exempt. While they're  supplying Canada with oil.
983 2018-10-21 21:47:53 The Saudis are facing a choice of sell oil in CNY or let Russia/Iran take what is going to be the biggest/only growth mkt away from them, as their US ally suddenly competes w them in export mkts.
984 2018-10-21 21:47:22 Your statement is correct in some ways. Statistically, if you obtain some kind of degree or some certification like in a vocational school you will make more money. In some instances like oil field you do make large sums of money but there is a higher chance of job loss.

Huge unending deficits.
Rising killer inflation.
Spiking oil and gas prices.
Wage stagnation.
Lowering standard of living.
Trade wars that he is losing.
Civil unrest.
Corruption like never seen before.
990 2018-10-21 21:46:27 Left palm oil behind almost 3 years ago. Most products that contain it are  food choices anyway. That makes it way easier I find.
991 2018-10-21 21:46:26 They're animals.  Do we really need their oil that badly?
992 2018-10-21 21:46:24 Three vampires must deny their untraditional love in North Dakota oil boom country.
993 2018-10-21 21:46:23 It’s not even that. It’s oil that gives them power. If we actually wanted to stop or curtail them, we’d stop buying their oil.

Never happening.
994 2018-10-21 21:46:00 Bread:Italian herb and cheese    Meat:Chicken Terriaki and Pepperoni Cheese:Mozzarella (ask for it extra toasted).                              Vegetables: Lettuce and Cucumbers.     Sauce:just oil with salt and pepper
995 2018-10-21 21:45:56 With all the sincerity of a snake oil salesmen. Or the guy that sold you the car that fell apart after 500km....
996 2018-10-21 21:45:56 @realDonaldTrump so that the voices of our people can not be heard, truly shameful oppression When will these people end when our people? They help their regime sell their oil to keep their accounts full of money and this regime remains in power
997 2018-10-21 21:45:54 "The biggest beneficiaries of Saudi output curbs today would be solar and wind producers. The unit cost of renewables has already fallen sharply as a result of technological advances, and each ratcheting up of oil prices will make solar and wind more competitive."
998 2018-10-21 21:45:40 Ditto! Coconut oil! Or Ghee
999 2018-10-21 21:45:31 OIL
1000 2018-10-21 21:45:30 We did not consent to the lies the Heath government & Wilson government gave us, it was never a Common Market, even lied about the cost of food cost rising, they blamed it on the oil crisis. 
So glad we are leaving the undemocratic EU, we have given so much away.
1001 2018-10-21 21:45:24 learned how to change my own oil, i'm a car boy now where's my horse girl girlfriend at?
1002 2018-10-21 21:45:22 Scotland
Land, farms, fishing rights owned by folk outside Scotland
Oil licences granted by & to folk outside Scotland.
Controlled on a day to day basis by folk outside Scotland.
Decisions on priorities, actions, spending, military, foreign affairs taken by outsiders.
Time to go!
1003 2018-10-21 21:45:14 We seem to forget where the oil comes from it’s not just about arms, and they are just now getting out away from a barbaric society
1004 2018-10-21 21:45:14 one time i spent a month in palestine and only drank this unlicensed energy beverage called XL and when i got back to the states i shat my pants but the weirdest thing was it wasn’t shit it was just oil pure shit oil
1005 2018-10-21 21:44:44 I’ll be dipping my bread in olive oil and doing my holiday baking with ANYTHING BUT Land O’Lakes.
1006 2018-10-21 21:44:43 I second that! Vitamin E oil does wonders, Mederma is pretty good. They also have these silicone-like bandages that you stick on a scar and it helps with healing. My friend used them on stitches on her baby's face and it worked great!
1007 2018-10-21 21:44:39 Most people <> all people. For most of Europe BEVs are great. Not in North America, unless you want to overturn road trip / pickup truck culture. Just as we make left-handed scissors b/c RH scissors don’t work for everyone, we’ll build hydrogen ... or let some folks use oil.
1008 2018-10-21 21:44:29 Just stopping by to note that taco seasoning and oil does not a salad dressing make.

1011 2018-10-21 21:43:41 coconut oil aint a cure all, my nut oil is however.
1012 2018-10-21 21:43:33 I only studied abroad for a semester and my mama made me a Shea butter cream. But when I was running low, I literally doused my hair in olive oil
1013 2018-10-21 21:43:26 City totally dependent on oil.
1014 2018-10-21 21:43:25 Well done to him. We don't need their Oil or Money, both tainted with blood.
1015 2018-10-21 21:43:24 Although we are a security threat.. .... We supply one third of your oil and have lots more if you need it.
1016 2018-10-21 21:43:10 The US is responsible for the Ill economic fate of Venezuela. All for greed of their oil. The US deliberately starves innocent people, fact.
1017 2018-10-21 21:42:49 They have massive $$$ from oil.  That’s how they get away with their crimes.  The problem with pure capitalism is they,d sell out their grandma,s , apple pie,& the Statue of Liberty for $$$. It has no morals or ethics    Very sad
1018 2018-10-21 21:42:47 Lol... What type of oil do u have??
1019 2018-10-21 21:42:44 Like i said, we have to do our part. But we have to let mining, oil/gas, farming, manufacturing and forestry continue to operate and be successful while we are doing our part.
1020 2018-10-21 21:42:39 If the child sings, I'm burning my telly on a bonfire of holy oil #13NightsOfFrights #MostHaunted

1022 2018-10-21 21:42:35 I would rather just drink frying oil cuz it's the same thing
1023 2018-10-21 21:42:32 Really, it’s not like most of the 911 attackers were from this country, right? 

We don’t need their business, their oil, nothing.
1024 2018-10-21 21:42:27 The best sentence in the story starts like this #’humans drilled the first oil well’ #and I thought it was coyotes doing the drilling 
1025 2018-10-21 21:42:13 Thank you then we die here kawai!
1026 2018-10-21 21:42:10 J'ai cramé 3/4 de mon Oil pour farm, elle avait intérêt de tomber xD

1027 2018-10-21 21:42:09 After sugar, Kindly add red oil, cowries and boiled egg to complete the sacrifice.
1028 2018-10-21 21:42:08 Wow, Saudi #khashoggi thing is a real dilemma for Trump and his Republicans. Money vs morals? So difficult. Thousands of innocent children dead in a Saudi run war in Yemen, and we sell, refuel and check the oil for them on the WMD we sold them. #BlueWaveSaves
1029 2018-10-21 21:42:00 what's the good argan oil? i love this shit but the shampoo i'm using is Too Expensive
1030 2018-10-21 21:41:49 Distributing groceries to PDVSA's drilling crews . I not sure but this must be the only oil company that allows this activities during drilling operations
1031 2018-10-21 21:41:42 Vitamin E oil and Mederma which is specifically supposed to help heal scars. You can get it over the counter. It helped heal a massive hydrocolloid burn I thought would certainly leave a scar and now you can't even tell.
1032 2018-10-21 21:41:30 My brother please do not be naive

Divorce between husband & wife is messy enough, talk less of a nation of 250+ ethnic nations.

How would the debts be shared? Assets (onshore & offshore)?

In a state like delta with so many tribes & as much oil what so you think will happen?
1033 2018-10-21 21:41:18 I’ll grab the oil 
1034 2018-10-21 21:41:16 Try heating with hair dryer or try tightening the screw then un tighten if those don’t work try a drop of oil on screw olive will do and leave for a bit. The tighten then un tighten usually works for me
1035 2018-10-21 21:41:11 And Elon Musk is basically @realDonaldTrump except slightly better at snake oil sales.
1036 2018-10-21 21:41:09 honestly every time I think avocado toast is just “okay” I have some with pickled onions and olive oil and I remember what joy is
1037 2018-10-21 21:41:08 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
1038 2018-10-21 21:41:08 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1039 2018-10-21 21:41:01 I boil water in it to loosen up what's left, then scrape it clean under hot water.  Let it cool down, then oil it again.  Easy.

1044 2018-10-21 21:40:30 If oil becomes more expensive to extract from the ground does the secondary market price of oil increase? Yeah

1049 2018-10-21 21:40:02 Are they no longer expensive? Hey one day I’ll hopefully be earning more than minimum wage and then maybe be able to choose to fill my tank with heating oil and buy a Mac. Ooooh warm and a fast processor.

1062 2018-10-21 21:38:47 Tylenol doesn’t work on me anymore so I guess I’m just going to either OD on my brain tumor medication or become an essential oil enthusiast and snort some peppermint extract or something idk
1063 2018-10-21 21:38:35 How about we stop buying their oil. #energyeast

1068 2018-10-21 21:38:02 Your skill level on picking sources is humorous to say the least. “The Election Integrity Project of Judicial Watch”. Don’t share JUDICIAL WATCH and INTEGRITY in the same tweet source. It’s like oil and vinegar. This is pure propaganda and the majority of Americans can see it.

1070 2018-10-21 21:37:44 We use Worcestershire sauce in a lot of things, not just meat-related. We use it in our favourite kale salad dressing that my wife makes (plus lemon juice, extra-virgin olive oil, garlic & Dijon mustard). We probably go through 2 or more larger bottles of it per year.
1071 2018-10-21 21:37:43 bruh this why i change my own oil

1073 2018-10-21 21:37:31 Do you even know the prospects of that place? Do you know that a nation can survive if it has any of these 4 - Manpower, oil, fertile land, or steel. Nigeria has these 4. C'mon! Some countries survive on one. Do you know what we can manufacture here in Nigeria???
1074 2018-10-21 21:37:22 I guess is ok with Mexico been invaded,maybe We Should go Down there and take over the oil fields!!

1076 2018-10-21 21:37:05 It creates a new required distance for oil and fracking companies pushing it from the current 500 feet (from houses, drinking sources, schools, hospitals, etc. that may be vulnerable) to I think 2,000-2,500 feet. Public safety is the biggest concern for Yes on 112

1085 2018-10-21 21:36:00 I'm not saying it's not worth eating. They sell smoothies here, but the oil is the most therapeutic.  In particular the nano-technology leveraging liposomal encapsulation technology for serum uptake.

1091 2018-10-21 21:35:07 I don't think you understand what you are saying. Every ethnic group has their own resources. If Nigeria divides will a Yoruba man go to caribari to drag the oil there or will an Igbo go to Huasa land to drag their resources. Dividing Nigeria is the only way to achieve peace.

1099 2018-10-21 21:33:23 Something I'm doing this week is cutting it into florets (think like brocolli), toss it in olive or coconut oil and salt/pepper, then roasting it at like 450 F

Optionally you can treat it like mashed potatoes and boil/mash/add cream and butter (or roast then mash)

1108 2018-10-21 21:32:17 Consequences seem to bring results. I've wondered if our country put as much into investing in alternative energies as giving tax breaks to wealthy oil corps, how much further ahead we'd be? Better energy solutions are coming along, but need more time to develop.
1109 2018-10-21 21:32:13 Mane Choices growth oil.

1113 2018-10-21 21:32:00 I can cook anything, holiday Turkey with apple/sausage stuffing, Greek lasagna (Pastichio), Hungarian goulash, salmon with maple syrup and sesame oil....you name it
1114 2018-10-21 21:31:57 I used a sauté pan to make my tomato sauce: chopped onions and garlic in olive oil, fresh tomatoes, salt, pepper, a tad of sugar, lots of fresh herbs. Voilà! For a veggies lasagne, I add mushrooms and courgettes to the onions and garlic. 
1115 2018-10-21 21:31:46 I loved their growth oil.

1117 2018-10-21 21:31:38 PSA: if there is oil down the entire track clean the entire track, not to the finish line and that’s it . Hope the dude that just wrecked his bike is good
1118 2018-10-21 21:31:34 Not this dog, last dog DID have severe pain in jointsThat is EXACTLY WHY I give my 9-yr-old dog @NaturesUltra Pet CBD Oil to PREVENT joint damage. Increased energy was surprise benefit! If I were you, I’d do anything to help your girl. Improves general health in aging dog too!
1119 2018-10-21 21:31:28 After almost 50 years of ME Oil petrodollars, you don’t think the MB could buy off a few politicians and journalists?
1120 2018-10-21 21:31:25 The FPJ highlights why China needs CNY oil and will give its market share to those pricing on CNY.

1122 2018-10-21 21:30:55 Good thing Saudi Arabia has oil — because they ***SUCK*** at manufacturing!  #Khashoggi
1123 2018-10-21 21:30:54 Yes, it was the Qatar pipeline, but in order to prevent Iranian gas and oil reaching Europe (not specifically Russian, although it was hoped it would make Russian pipeline through Ukrainian to Europe redundant) while also removing a Russian navel base.
1124 2018-10-21 21:30:54 KSA must be SHUNNED by the global community, and so must any country doing business with them.  make their oil worthless.

Interpol must take over the Khashoggi investigation.  the LAST people to have control over *recipe-testing* their own lies should be MbS & his assassins.
1125 2018-10-21 21:30:49 Damn, I forgot about that.  The stench of oil.

1135 2018-10-21 21:29:18 The fact is we never need to borrow in the first place when PDP was in power. When Okonjon Iweala was advicing the gorvenment of Jonathan to save money for the raining days during the oil boom, they refused,  but instead started looting like no tomorrow!
1136 2018-10-21 21:29:16 after the game classic weekend y’all going to clubs or oil spill 
1137 2018-10-21 21:29:10 Turkey, USA, Germany and the uk, normally supplicant to the oil gods, now sense an opportunity for strategic gain. Any notions of humanity or justice is for the red top reading morons.
1138 2018-10-21 21:28:52 Mother's sea children not been pleased at all these who authorize oil spill's & pollution into the water have a purpose not only do they kill off sea life they lessen the food in the sea 4 those moormaid sea ancestors wanting them to come up 2 da surface cause dey cant find them
1139 2018-10-21 21:28:37 Locking kids up, selling public wilderness to big oil, killing the environment, putting farmers on welfare. Tariffs killing economy, number one nail co in Mo. laid people off, price of steel sky rocketed. Tax cuts, health care... the list goes on and on and on.

1153 2018-10-21 21:26:13 I love that idea of the olive oil ... not sure what the tea would be like from the leaves though but I'll try anything! #craftbizparty
1154 2018-10-21 21:26:10 corporations/agencies that generate revenue for the Federal Govt. Removing the tariff has potentially two implications which are a dip in revenue to the govt and a threat to local manufacturers. The govt cannot set a price band for pad manufacturers, as in the oil sector, as it
1155 2018-10-21 21:25:51 I have yet to get my oil changed lol tomorrow is the day foreal
1156 2018-10-21 21:25:51 Oh, that's a easy one!

Saudi's have oil.
1157 2018-10-21 21:25:47 Hey @SquishCandy - can you please exclude palm oil from your products? Destroying rainforests and orangutans is not cool.

1162 2018-10-21 21:24:48 Thanks yes you get the best finish if you take the time to sand fully. Obviously getting the best cut from the tool first reduces amount of sanding needed. I mostly sand to 600, sanding sealer and microcrystaline wax. I oil greenturned work with foodsafe oil once they've dried.
1163 2018-10-21 21:24:42 Okay I’ll research one oil paint artist and one watercolour and see which one she likes most
1164 2018-10-21 21:24:28 S/o to my step dad for putting gas in my car, air in my tires and got me an oil change
1165 2018-10-21 21:24:23 One must look at the state of the world ... Canada should not follow the lead of the Germany , because that only hurts their own deal ... rest assured a replacement purchase order has already been issued to a replacement vendor ... cancel an oil deal , now that takes guts

1170 2018-10-21 21:23:52 It's perfect for that sort of thing and you can use olive oil instead of varnish to treat it.  Such an amazing tree, you can even make tea from the leaves!! #CraftBizParty
1171 2018-10-21 21:23:45 As Slippery as an eel in a bucket of olive oil.
1172 2018-10-21 21:23:38 I fry them in either olive oil, avocado oil, or bacon fat, get a good sear, then finish in the oven.  Fine with my method, but I don't use bacon fat often enough, but I'm kinda tempted since we're talking about to fry some bacon tonight, then use that fat.
1173 2018-10-21 21:23:22 Sanders:”Congratulations to Ireland for passing a bill to divest about $350M from fossil fuels like coal, oil, & gas. If we are going to solve the greatest threat to our planet, we must aggressively transition away from fossil fuels toward sustainable energy like wind and solar.”
1174 2018-10-21 21:23:17 18 of the 19 hijackers were Saudis. It's only because of Saudi oil that we continue to look the other way. And when the truth finally comes out that the Mad King ordered the killing... we'll just simply look the other way like we've always done
1175 2018-10-21 21:23:13 Could you please try checking international news on oil prices.
I believe in every country its same price
1176 2018-10-21 21:23:03 Maybe diet of cooking oil, yes cooking oil Sadza  ne nyama renders our minds too timid or docile. Maybe there's a serious problem with the mindset of Zimbabweans to the extent of bieng recolonised again
1177 2018-10-21 21:22:45 Nikki just doused her whole life in tea tree oil.
1178 2018-10-21 21:22:36 Conservatives use science at their own convenience.

When it's the climate unraveling at the expense of big oil, there's "scientists on both sides."

But when it's gender policy on the line, the favorable science is "objective, and administrable."

Hypocritical 'conservatives.'
1179 2018-10-21 21:22:33 There is no such thing as "renewables" as applied to solar and wind power.  It is a hippy marketing term.  Without a global oil based infrastructure wind and solar power systems would be unaffordably expensive.  Time to dispense with fantasies.
1180 2018-10-21 21:22:32 You could almost stand next to the engine to change the oil. Oh and you could fit 4 kegs in the trunk.  Got about 12 mpg which went down to about 8 mpg when loaded up with aforementioned kegs.
1181 2018-10-21 21:22:17 Sold as an Island wholesale to US, massive Health Insurance and revitalised Student fee Investments. Oil and Gas galore 200 billion enough to buy #WM and her politicians

1183 2018-10-21 21:21:56 You know it is starting to get cold when your coconut oil solidifies.
1184 2018-10-21 21:21:47 That’s because thousands of U.K. jobs rely on the Saudi oil fields and them buying U.K. armaments and aerospace products
1185 2018-10-21 21:21:45 there's not a result of Ravi Parmar. Would the House Leader’s comments: there are GPs, general practitioners, on the oil behind. With 2/3
1186 2018-10-21 21:21:35 I was in boots today when someone threw a bottle of omega 3 capsules at me. Luckily I escaped with only super fish oil injuries.
1187 2018-10-21 21:21:30 Lol I was about to set up my oil change but my dad said I should just get a new car instead lmao so new car coming soon 
1188 2018-10-21 21:21:27 @Sqaishey is so right about olbas oil. And everything she says about managing anxiety. Thank you, lovely, this is good advice. You’re amazing 
1189 2018-10-21 21:21:19 Are we really surprised that the Saudi's killed the journalist. The Saudi government and Saudi individuals have financed terrorist organizations around the world for years. We mostly overlooked them because of their oil. Well, it's time we showed some backbone.
1190 2018-10-21 21:20:55 He's getting paid by Saudis, and the GOP Congress? They're afraid of what higher oil prices would do for their reelection bids. That's all there is to that.
1191 2018-10-21 21:20:54 Acne more often affects skin with a greater number of oil glands; these areas include the face, the upper part of the chest, and the back.
1192 2018-10-21 21:20:51 Well we were on a roll racing until the bike decided to spit a valve and part of the piston in to the clutch and oil pan ...
1193 2018-10-21 21:20:29 :) oh for sure, it definitely has better eye appeal, but i do like scrapple, you just have to make sure you don't fry it up with a lot of grease or oil, a lite dusting in flour in addition to the cornmeal adds to the crunch.
1194 2018-10-21 21:20:25 @rachaelray taken when he 1st gets up than midday & before he goes to sleep. Mix w/nuts & salad also read eat some without the oil first & than the rest if he has any weight issues. Grt everyone to do 1/2 the amount. & 1 liter daily water w/30 mg/L silica -volvic or Gerolsteiner
1195 2018-10-21 21:20:22 Yeah, boots own brand have loads of vit e in them too. Great for the skin, google evening primrose oil.
Go to boots tomorrow, then get your cv together and take some control. You got this shit fellow queen
It'll be ok in the end. If its not ok, its not the end.
1196 2018-10-21 21:20:14 Look what's really happening here. The shale oil production in the US mid west makes the need for Iranians and Saudis obsolete. I think they're at the point of letting all sides in the mid east have at it, all effective governments destroyed.
1197 2018-10-21 21:20:10 @FWhitfield why wud u call saudi arabia after 9/11 after most all of those involved in that which happened came from and financed thru the saudi govt? I do not quite understand WHY as it was probably in some way our oil money they spent. Along comes trumpski
1198 2018-10-21 21:20:10 Lol Alumni not Alimni , well not all, even in most parasatals and agencies Abusites rule.
This is not worth arguing abeg, goodnight.

1200 2018-10-21 21:20:02 You seem to have a difficulty with the truth. By your own assertions you should become a ‘Yoon’ Multiple sources and you still deny, you’ll be telling me next that oil is only a bonus but still $150 a barrel. Once a liar always a liar!

1202 2018-10-21 21:19:17 США а если точнее американские компании такие как Standard Oil,General Motors,Ford, до 1944 года поставляли горюче-смазочные материалы.Их технические отделы и производства  работали на благо Германии.

1205 2018-10-21 21:19:01 Well, to be honest I used to add Sugar to yam, with onions and few drops of vegetable oil. It was delicious and I really loved it. However, I stopped not because I didn't like it but to reduce sugar consumption.

 “...how do we dance while our earth is turning? How do we sleep while our beds are burning?” 

6 year old daughter (from the back of the car) - “easy... you sleep on the sofa. Next song.”
1210 2018-10-21 21:18:26 I agree with you, but as a Canadian, I know, to my own chagrin, that we supply 40% of America’s oil; Saudi Arabia is a distant second at 11%. America doesn’t need Saudi oil! This has more to do with Trump’s deep, and long standing business dealings with the Saud monarchy, et al.
1211 2018-10-21 21:18:10 I am totally fine with him giving the liberals the middle finger and taking a well deserved break. He did his best to be fair. As a supporter of "equality" I'm glad he pushed our prehistoric marriage laws. If he was a big a douche as abbot he'd be trying to oil his way back.
1212 2018-10-21 21:18:05 Try adding an essential oil that you do like the scent of.
1213 2018-10-21 21:18:04 I produce my own palm oil on a regular basis. Hand pumped. Don’t why it’s illegal for me to sell it though. Unless I’m misunderstanding what palm oil is. It’s a euphemism right?
1214 2018-10-21 21:18:03 @cafreeland Talk is cheap. Stop buying 80,000 barrels of oil per day from Saudi Arabia if you want them to listen.
1215 2018-10-21 21:18:01 I don't like it for myself. I respect the right of adults to use it medicinally in whatever scenario helps them. My uncle died of stomach cancer and he used cannabis oil for the pain as he was on hospice at home. Stomach cancer is very fast and he only had six weeks.
1216 2018-10-21 21:17:52 "nearly all our electricity comes from either nuclear or coal/oil/gas."

Coal? Maybe get P. Foster to give @myGridGB a follow if he isn't too far behind the times to know what Twitter is. He might be surprised at how much solar/wind energy is produced compared w/ coal these days.
1217 2018-10-21 21:17:52 I take the heart of his message as "Washington has been corrupted, and unless you're a gazillionaire, you're being screwed". 

He's not wrong about that, and if he can get that message through to the dumbasses that keep buying the GOP snake oil, more power to him.
1218 2018-10-21 21:17:49 I don’t even know what that is. I’ll stick to paying $6 for my oil of Olay 
1219 2018-10-21 21:17:48 a lie washed down with oil

1221 2018-10-21 21:17:40 Saudis are beyond the pale now. Let's get out of oil and into renewables and stop taking their trade money. Put them back in the sandbox where they belong.
1222 2018-10-21 21:17:15 Me and ironing are like water and oil but today I ironed my nephew's school uniforms without being asked. I shook myself everyday
1223 2018-10-21 21:17:11 Dang! You just described the local shop where my oil gets changed.
1224 2018-10-21 21:17:07 America has the means to ween itself off Arabian oil. Then it can cut those murderers loose
1225 2018-10-21 21:17:05 Are there pipelines for gasoline? Bitumen byproduct of heavy oil doesn’t need pipeline at all.
1226 2018-10-21 21:16:55 Yep. Nope. The thing is most of these companies still violate sustainable palm oil! I think if we the consumer reduce our usage then there just will be no demand or reduced demand! Every choice I make is a vote and support of something! I have to chose to support the right thing
1227 2018-10-21 21:16:50 hayop ayaw talaga matanggal kailangan ko ng oil
1228 2018-10-21 21:16:50 When Trump has moved on to the next scam, the US and World are going to have to deal with this 'Mr Bone Saw' fella .... suggestions?

How about the US forces an end to the Saudi Monarchy entirely? After all, the Oil is running out anyway, soon no one will need them.
1229 2018-10-21 21:16:48 People think H2 is extracted from water,  but the truth is 86% of h2 extraction is done from coal, oil and natural gas. It's as polluting well to tank as any other ICE.
1230 2018-10-21 21:16:36 Try it roasted. Drizzle with olive oil and some salt and pepper.

1233 2018-10-21 21:15:59 1) CBD Oil (also gives me extremely vivid dreams)
2) Hot water + 2 Tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar + 1 Tbsp Honey (about 30 minutes before bed, if I’m out of CBD)

Interested in trying out a chilipad in the future.
1234 2018-10-21 21:15:58 Let’s assume it is. The so called ABU Alimni that are now actors in democracy were active members of the ABU SUG then.
1235 2018-10-21 21:15:55 You haven't , we use the oil money to pay for our services . Oil barely covered the cost of free prescriptions .
1236 2018-10-21 21:15:52 Think of all the money we wouldnt have to ship overseas! Use Canadian oil!!!!!!
1237 2018-10-21 21:15:48 ตอนนี้เทอว่ามัยพี่จะไปหาเลยคั
1238 2018-10-21 21:15:44 Craving for Mang Inasal and Dear Manok!!! Ang oil ba.. 
1239 2018-10-21 21:15:25 The minute you create a new format for startups, you just generate a stampede of professional advisers telling everyone else how to use the format for their 99 year old whale oil burning business. Easy to complain about govt policy, tougher to offer practical solutions.
1240 2018-10-21 21:15:25 I find the whole climate change debate an exercise in frustration. Canadians are buying more trucks and large vehicles using more gas ,oil and creating huge emissions at the same time they express alarm about climate change. Governments suggest carbon taxes that give rebates!
1241 2018-10-21 21:15:20 Lol “my tires are messed up, I need an oil change”. Knowing damn well!
1242 2018-10-21 21:15:18 I use tresemme keratin oil for mine and it works wonders
1243 2018-10-21 21:15:10 True for the most part its not oil
1244 2018-10-21 21:15:06 @HubbwayHire might just want to dip his engine oil before he goes out on a run in the morning
1245 2018-10-21 21:14:54 Right?! It was decent, but not good enough to justify spending that much on it. Honestly the BEST thing I’ve found for my skin is lipid oils i.e. jojoba oil, grape seed, and vitamin E. I swear by it!! And it’s cheap!
1246 2018-10-21 21:14:54 i can’t even cough around my grandma without her shoving peppermint oil down my throat
1247 2018-10-21 21:14:50 Uzi, this matter pass holive oil, add palm kernel oil bcos me sef with all my chineked/oluwa(d) anointing still get convulsion.... how ?, is yet to be revealed to me .....jah ! Jah ! Jah ! Angel mickey is carreid ....holy !
1248 2018-10-21 21:14:42 You have no clue, Alberta is one of the MOST regulated oil and gas industries in the entire world.  Albertans in general are better stewards of the environment than most people.  We have  2 of best National Parks in the entire world!
1249 2018-10-21 21:14:38 There is more than enough minerals in world to supply Lithium, up to next 320 years in fact. Remember also that petrol, once you burn it, it’s is gone and More oil must be dug up. But Lithium at the end of a batteries lifespan can be recovered and re-used to make new batteries.
1250 2018-10-21 21:14:38 Which essential oil will help me forget my childhood
1251 2018-10-21 21:14:33 I've been poorly today so lucy heated me up a hot water bottle to soothe my tummy and put lavender oil round my room to help me sleep, she's so cute!!!!!
1252 2018-10-21 21:14:11 A tough past.
1253 2018-10-21 21:14:09 In the end, every western country is being hypocritical regarding Saudi Arabia 

Canada is no better. The Liberals are offering platitudes, but they still don’t have a problem buying their oil or them selling armoured vehicles.
1254 2018-10-21 21:14:09 This, my friends, is a socialist. @MaxineWaters announcing wanting to take over all American companies including oil. #MaxineWatersABigThreat

1263 2018-10-21 21:13:07 Which countries? the Iraqi oil wells??? The poppies in Afghanistan, interfering in the business of other countries, killing the leaders and replacing them with dictators? Some peeps can see through the bullshit of your military...more of predators & scavengers

1276 2018-10-21 21:11:47 On top of what we spend buying oil on the open market, we pay another 50 million a day in lost revenue to support countries with dubious human rights records.

1278 2018-10-21 21:11:36 & some clean beautiful oil and gas.

1283 2018-10-21 21:11:09 They are all on the east coast, so same lack of pipeline problem. Plus Saudi oil is light. Why not build refinery in Alberta itself close to the source? Exporting final products brings more $$ as well.
1284 2018-10-21 21:11:01 How do you come up on the analysis that Erikssen > Oil pls how? What as Erikssen won in his football career compare to Ozil and lastly Sum up there individual goals + assist and tell me what you've. But with your bad and failed mathematics you won't come out good on it.. Biased
1285 2018-10-21 21:11:00 They got oil, and money. Trump loves both. You think he cares about innocent people starve to death? We use to be a country of high morality, and human rights. No more, with Nikki at the helm in UN and Bolton NSA, & Trump, basically we are Fucked!
1286 2018-10-21 21:10:51 Saw a guy planting flowers at Denny’s in Marion while I was walking to pick up my car from an oil change

Me: Aren’t those going to be dead really soon?
Denny’s manager: I just need them to last til Tuesday

1287 2018-10-21 21:10:50 Various regulations on the coal and oil industry to start with. Lol you know he single handedly saved the coal industry here right?
1288 2018-10-21 21:10:49 @virginiafoxx
FDA is ignoring the fact that Titanium Dioxide is used in MANY prescriptions and supplements. Think LEAD PAINT, used for decades, still causing damage. T. D. is emulsified artist's oil paint, METAL. Think ALZHEIMERS. Hope you can address this SERIOUS matter.

1303 2018-10-21 21:09:40 Oh and by the way interest rates are going up because inflation is rising and that is because of 3 major factors.

Oil prices are rising because of your sanctions on Iran

Your corporate tax cut

Your trade wars.

So don't blame the fed. You own this!
1304 2018-10-21 21:09:39 Tesla is the best selling car in the US by revenue for the last two months while fighting two deeply entrenched industries, existing auto companies and the oil industry. His other company has launched rockets into space and landed them unharmed. Give evidence for your assertion.
1305 2018-10-21 21:09:31 Your analysis of the Ethanol busness fails to address the value of NOT importing oil from countries that hate us. I buy E85 just for the satisfaction of knowing that my transportation dollars stay right here in the good old USA.
1306 2018-10-21 21:09:30 Got the meatiest chunk of salt pork I could find. Pros: delicious. Cons: almost no fat to render out.

Me: gotta add some grease if I want these onions to fry.
Me, home cook: veggie oil, has no flavor
Me, eventual babci: BUTTER, CHILD, BUTTER
1307 2018-10-21 21:09:28 For every dollar the government invests in oil and natural gas through subsidies and tax breaks, a dollar should be invested in green energy.
1308 2018-10-21 21:09:26 I know you don’t wanna hear this but he’ll come when he’s ready! Walk a lot!! A LOT. And do squats lol. Dakota only came one day early after a membrane sweep, spicy food, bouncing on a ball, sex, and then castor oil. Don’t do castor oil btw. Bad experience and not good for baby.
1309 2018-10-21 21:09:22 I came with olive oil, you forgot it
1310 2018-10-21 21:09:20 Why is coconut oil the remedy for all Indian moms?
Dry skin? Throw coconut oil on it 
Dry hair? Throw coconut oil on it 
Need seasoning? Throw coconut oil on it 
Declining GPA? Throw coconut oil on it
1311 2018-10-21 21:09:03 I just voted in FL, absentee mail-in, for A. Gillum, an offshore oil drilling ban (sorry vapers), voting rights for former convicts, and five GOP judge removals. There is no blue wave, only us. Do something good. Do anything you can to right this tilting ship. No excuses.
1312 2018-10-21 21:08:48 In case you haven't noticed early bird. . #Horsehill 1 is Gushing oil and gas. SCC have give planning permission for 2more wells and long term production testing the very the next three years. Hardly getting in our way anymore are they. Tanzania  . Who do you have grease palms?

#Notley phasing out coal & has expanded renewable.

But, we still need to ship oil in transistion period. #TransMountain will help us get world price. We are a country - we shouldn't work against ourselves
1321 2018-10-21 21:07:46 .....forward thinking based on goals of human progress as the goal, accomplished by various means. Teddy Roosevelt was a hero that ended the vicious gilded age.

1324 2018-10-21 21:07:22 You think the same gov that is too inept, leaky, inefficient, and slow to regulate health insurance, enviro protections, oil, power, education, or business also runs a deep state, new-world-order conspiracy it's kept secret from 300m people for decades? Fool. #QAnon = #QuackAnon
1325 2018-10-21 21:07:14 "....as long as we don't have to stop buying Saudi oil and avoid using that dirty, evil Alberta oil!"
*SPITS*
1326 2018-10-21 21:07:00 Prop 112 is about stricter regulations on oil and gas setbacks in Colorado.  Nessa got it in for elway because he outed the truth about offering Colin an opportunity a couple years back and he turned it down.
1327 2018-10-21 21:06:51 I put about 6 in a little bag and toss in the washer. I add about a 1/4 cup of epsom salts & baking soda (combined with a few drops of an essential oil) to freshen even more.
1328 2018-10-21 21:06:40 Bru my car so low i cracked my oil pan already
1329 2018-10-21 21:06:37 I’ll defo try coconut oil next time. Still my hair is very moisturised, I have to say.

She didn't make us take our shoes off but we mostly did. i don't mind shoes in my house; it's ppls sweaty foot oil on my carpet i dislike! but on the other hand too many ppl spit on sidewalks. ewww!!

1339 2018-10-21 21:04:56 My work ethic needs coconut oil. Is coconut oil still makgona tsohle?
1340 2018-10-21 21:04:51 Me: This pasta is good, what all did you put in it??

Mom: Garlic, parmesan cheese, a little salt&pepper, a little olive oil, and a whole stick of butter.

Oh-fucking-kay, Paula Deen 
1341 2018-10-21 21:04:23 ever since i got my elbow scab my friends threaten me to hit it or just abuse of it :’) and little story time, i was making eggs and the oil in the pan jumped and hit my scab #thatshithurted
1342 2018-10-21 21:04:22 Why? When it comes to oil you have to dig deeper to find the real reasons for price hikes and shortages. We learned the hard way in the 70s.
1343 2018-10-21 21:04:19 Bill Gates doesn't own an oil rich country! the house of saud is reportedly worth more than 1trillion..
1344 2018-10-21 21:04:04 oil? really?  fabulous!!!! 
@Crypto_Bitlord question: molly pre sleep, right?
1345 2018-10-21 21:03:52 I understand you mentioning opportunities. Yes we could look into products to grow the Ghanaian economy but, (here is one) Malaysia is the top producer of Palmnut oil.  Nkrumah gave them the Palm Oil seeds and showed them what to do.  That is an opportunity.... in my eyes..
1346 2018-10-21 21:03:43 I wish i could sell snake oil like ole Bozo....  What a  bunch of saps!!!!  #MilkYourFans
1347 2018-10-21 21:03:40 he had a good run. now he will have to write opeds for the wsj in between oil royalty checks
1348 2018-10-21 21:03:37 When bae does your oil change for you to save you some coins 
1349 2018-10-21 21:03:32 내 동생 잘생겼어 점점 잘생겨진다 했는데 성형한듯..그래서 잘생겼구나 암튼 잘생겼어
1350 2018-10-21 21:03:26 Actually California has the 6th or 7th biggest economy. Its losing in the ranks due to horrible taxes and policies. Also, they create a huge state deficit (billions) every year. So don't think a large economy is a good economy.
Louisiana has no problem processing the oil.
1351 2018-10-21 21:03:21 My favorite is engine oil.
1352 2018-10-21 21:02:59 Agreed
I was living in Brazil when the wall came down. A big deal for me

A Brazilian told me he was very worried that the US would now be unfettered. He predicted the destruction within a decade of either Brazil if it went left wing or a major ME oil producer.

It was Iraq.
1353 2018-10-21 21:02:59 I think we need to do a lot more than carbon taxes. We just commit to immediate reduction in production and consumption of oil and gas. Invest heavily in green technologies. Change our mindset of the personal car being the best transportation option.
1354 2018-10-21 21:02:40 Absolutely you are nice and well-respected people, but your government is a rouge regime who doesn’t respect any international law just because it produces a whole lot of oil and the rest of the word relays on it.
1355 2018-10-21 21:02:27 All y’all niggas need oil diffusers .. all y’all food gone taste like glade plugins . Stainling the pots and shit
1356 2018-10-21 21:02:21 Umm the oil maybe too hot.
1357 2018-10-21 21:02:17 Imagine if a whiner line caller struck oil and bought the Bills and Sabres and got to decide who coaches them and what sort of character determines success.
1358 2018-10-21 21:02:14 You have bn named iliyaa
1359 2018-10-21 21:02:07 Its actually better to do it a lil darker so it lasts longer. Like on a weekend ur not going anywhere. U could also fade it with oil/cotton if its too much
1360 2018-10-21 21:02:06 They will come and shout for joy on the heights of Zion;
    they will rejoice in the bounty of the Lord—
the grain, the new wine and the olive oil,
    the young of the flocks and herds.
They will be like a well-watered garden,
    and they will sorrow no more. - Jeremiah 31:12
1361 2018-10-21 21:02:05 And most of those in power will.  A few tanks, guns and armoured vehicles may have their delivery dates postponed but oil will continue to flow, without pause, to the loudest who now feign outrage.
1362 2018-10-21 21:02:05 We have plenty of refineries. Unfortunately, some of them are using Saudi oil.
1363 2018-10-21 21:01:57 That ship sailed a long time ago... before we supported Pinochet, installed the Shah in Iran and killed tens of millions of people in the Middle East for oil.
1364 2018-10-21 21:01:44 He never had the right to choose the black market and he never will. Under ACMPR, He can grow his own as well or he can use a more cost effective (and overall effective) oil and stop buying oz's of cannabis and dose twice a day. You have no legs here man.
1365 2018-10-21 21:01:35 진짜..난 또 예에전에 봤던 그 아저씨 같은 애인이랑 결혼 하는줄 알고 좀 침울했는데 다른 남자랑 결혼하더라 그 남자랑 헤어졌나보군..결혼상대는 나이도 언니 또레 같아 보여서 안도했다
1366 2018-10-21 21:01:08 just use baby oil uwu
1367 2018-10-21 21:00:55 Realize what?
1368 2018-10-21 21:00:55 Oddly we never needed their oil. It was really for Japan and other allies.
1369 2018-10-21 21:00:41 Poor monarchy. We play tiny violins for its plight of being exposed as the most arrogant, dishonest barbaric regime in the world. May its crude oppressors each drown in his own barrel of crude oil.

1385 2018-10-21 20:59:22 Cool. Then we can frack more and drill for more of our own oil. What about Ethanol? American energy Independence sounds like a plan. Who needs Saudi Arabia anyway?
1386 2018-10-21 20:59:21 I show dominance by sleeping with no pillows! What what?
1387 2018-10-21 20:59:13 There is some analysis by Blanchard I think. But difficult to be conclusive. The contrast between the different oil hikes is huge. I suspect they all contributed.

1398 2018-10-21 20:57:38 Is it mythical.. Blackhole in Norwegian against UK oil.. No Norway produces much more Ekofisk is choked back to 60percent
Do you think that oil is a charity.. What pays wages, safety, infrastructure?

1407 2018-10-21 20:56:35 It should also be noted that the Oil Rig was the central HQ for the Enclave. Their Intel about the mainland came from outposts, the vault program, and smaller groups who acted as informants

1418 2018-10-21 20:54:53 Both regimes are disgusting. I’m not defending anyone. Saudi is just propped up by oil money. They can pay for friends. I’m glad they are being exposed in a way that can’t be covered though
1419 2018-10-21 20:54:47 It's rather tasty, if I say so myself.  Wish I could afford all the ingredients I used to. I have a few good recipes for sauce, including one that is just fresh plum tomatoes skinned, seeded and diced, garlic, fresh basil and olive oil in a skillet for about five minutes.

1421 2018-10-21 20:54:40 Has anyone heard more regarding @FriedgeHNIC comments last night that Drai wants to play with McD? Is that an actual story coming out of the Oil, or just a guess/speculation?

1438 2018-10-21 20:52:31 Wow ok. That was a good article. Thanks. Alright I’ll switch my activism to using sustainable palm oil as that may have a lesser environmental impact than stopping the use of it. Will still need to dig deep into this sustainable palm oil. Many companies still violate it!

1485 2018-10-21 20:46:57 Elizabeth, problem is we may want them to pay for alt therapies, but I'm not holding my breath.

1487 2018-10-21 20:46:49 To help you read, the answer is no when the people are misinformed. Which you seem to be keen on continuing. But once someone is informed, like you are, you’re responsible for your informed choices.

1488 2018-10-21 20:46:42 Had a niggling excited feeling in my belly and just remembered I bought a new oil for my diffuser today. Ylang ylang. Love to be in my late twenties!!! Somebody tell me to slow down!!
1489 2018-10-21 20:46:40 Third point: oil production is capital intensive. Cost of labour has little effect on profits. When there's a labour shortage,  increase wages.
Since the Alberta government basically gives away oil with no benefit to Albertans, high wages are the only economic benefit.
1490 2018-10-21 20:46:39 + standing after the explosion - would be the first he aimed at. Like shooting targets at the fair. The smell of oil and gunpowder burned in his nostrils and he gritted his teeth.

1497 2018-10-21 20:46:07 We had an oil price spike in the mid 2000s. Compare inflation and growth then to when similar spikes happened in 1970s. Inflation expectations were anchored because it was clear central banks were controlling inflation.

Considering his "accomplishments" e.g. crashing Saudi oil revenues, getting KSA involved in the Yemeni quagmire, kidnapping Hariri, threatening Quatar, resulting in a Turkish base there, etc., etc., etc, I think "Clown Prince" would be more apt.
1504 2018-10-21 20:45:08 So what... Germany has been sanctioned by the Saudis for many months now...No big  deal to Germany to make them more angry...They aren't dependent upon Saudi oil...Canada is.
1505 2018-10-21 20:45:04 Ferrari have a different oil tank and breather set up, Inc their customer teams. The vent comes out under the tail light. All the other teams vent it under the hot exhaust

1508 2018-10-21 20:44:42 They act like by time they buy the icing and cake mix and eggs oil decorations it’s going to be the same price as a Walmart cake for 10$
1509 2018-10-21 20:44:38 The £15billion deficit is mythical..,Scottish exports via English ports etc not counted. Huge black hole in oil revenue cf Norway oil production/ revenue against the UK’s. It’s when we open up the true Scottish budget the true picture will emerge. Tell me the benefit of staying.
1510 2018-10-21 20:44:38 would one get high if you apply cannabis oil like lotion?
1511 2018-10-21 20:44:33 "Our Faustian deal was this: As long as the Saudis kept our oil prices low, bought our fighter jets, housed our fleets and drones and gave us cover in the region, they could keep their country proudly medieval." - Maureen Dowd
1512 2018-10-21 20:44:32 Trump like Saudi, it’s oil, Defense contacts.
1513 2018-10-21 20:44:24 just drink the oil
1514 2018-10-21 20:44:20 do u put any oil on them at night? if not try castor oil!!
1515 2018-10-21 20:44:15 To heal a pimple quickly, apply tea tree oil on pimple every few hours, and apply vitamin E oil on the spot, about 1 hour before bedtime.
1516 2018-10-21 20:43:20 Seems like it. The Pegulas just keep proving they have NO CLUE how to run one professional sports franchise, let alone two. They either buy snake oil from frauds like Murray & Ryan or they pick jokes like McDermott & Housley. Anyone but people they'd have to respect and defer to.
1517 2018-10-21 20:43:17 I believe mr trump your secret days of I need to get to's for all of you are over.  palladium mr trump no matter how ingested is an element that cost your friend any chance no matter what job you have.  you knew it and if he tries it again it fails just like your oil deal.
1518 2018-10-21 20:43:16 I got some peppermint oil you can have
1519 2018-10-21 20:42:58 ohhhhh... WELL, im gonna share a good recipe with you that’s really easy to make anyway:

potatoes cut up, slicked with oil, and a lil’ bit of minced garlic & throw ‘em in the oven for a hour to get garlic roasted potatoes 
1520 2018-10-21 20:42:54 My father took a teaspoon of olive oil , after a gallon of water ... he swears it makes pass
1521 2018-10-21 20:42:53 The  strong = war, you people are paranoid lunatics, America fought wars for oil not freedom, and for revenge against the wrong country after 9/11
1522 2018-10-21 20:42:51 of money to influence the political process.

Perhaps, the biggest winners of Citizens United are Charles and David Koch, owners of the second-largest privately run business in America Koch Industries.

Among other things, the Koch brothers own oil refineries in Texas, Alaska,
1523 2018-10-21 20:42:44 Funny you should say  Wearing as you speak! Also pink himalayan/Epsom/Bergomont oil Soaks in hot water helps alot ! Dr.Teals brand is awesome and very resonable at Walmart the whole line of products very good I love them- lavendar too help w/sleep
1524 2018-10-21 20:42:37 So, let's add legumes (beans), cereals, breads, fish, nuts, and extra virgin olive oil to the "eat your fruits and veggies" message! #FNCE

1525 2018-10-21 20:42:29 Getting this oil change and fluids filled on my baby
1526 2018-10-21 20:42:20 Second point: 
By choosing to export dillbit, instead of synthetic crude, oil sands producers left themselves vulnerable to the whims of foreign refiners. It's a completely different market.
It's like choosing to export cows instead of meat, then whining that $cow/lb<<$beef/lb
1527 2018-10-21 20:41:54 I know the item’s name, beloved; taste doesn’t change the fact that it is salted and diced tomato in olive oil on toast and ergo overpriced. Have a good day!
1528 2018-10-21 20:41:41 Containing palm oil
1529 2018-10-21 20:41:15 Shame you muted me, because if you hadn’t you had read me questioning you on your desperate attempts to attack supposed “fat-shaming” which is just because your snake oil makes your clients remain in an unfavourable body shape, so you keep LYING.
1530 2018-10-21 20:41:11 Oh eventually they come up with the best possible excuse.  They are oil rich but intelligence poor
1531 2018-10-21 20:40:40 never trust a man wearing a tablecoth on his head. Withou oil Saudis have nothing.
1532 2018-10-21 20:40:37 Oil rich AK paying National high at the pump, cost of living skyrocketing, inflation skyrocketing, citizens trade war tariff taxes killing us we had a golden goose economy and let's see if in 2 more years it becomes a lump of coal...yea people time for a change
1533 2018-10-21 20:40:23 How do we promote using BTC for large scale international commodity contracts for oil, minerals, grain, etc.? EU already looking at moving away from the USD for European deals but Euro not stable in the long term. BTC much more suited to large scale contracts than pizzas!
1534 2018-10-21 20:40:14 A conservative believes in free markets, individual liberty and strong alliances.

Teddy Roosevelt was a Republican but not a conservative. Going after Standard Oil was both wrong and unnecessary.

Kristol is more conservative than Trump.

TPP was our best weapon against China.
1535 2018-10-21 20:40:08 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
1536 2018-10-21 20:39:53 Its egg fried  with palm oil, U can take urs and see hw delicious it is. Thank me later
1537 2018-10-21 20:39:30 I mix my sweet potatoes with either bacon fat or coconut oil, garlic and onion powder and cinnamon then bake... so freaking good... great paleo recipe
1538 2018-10-21 20:39:17 Just picked up my oil from @AshVProducts time have my hair healthy and growing 
1539 2018-10-21 20:39:14 Most "progressive countries" could fit together in an area the size of California. I agree that we need to find better alternatives, but until that day comes, oil prices will be tied to the cost of other goods. Higher shipping costs means higher prices on everything.
1540 2018-10-21 20:39:09 They also only have very limited product available. I don't think edibles are currently legal, just flower and oil.
1541 2018-10-21 20:39:04 Cursed by the Duke of Oil, Gadesrule predicted it!
1542 2018-10-21 20:38:51 With the current cooking oil shortage in Zimbabwe you see someone carrying a tax bag which has only one royco satchet yet on the other hand carrying 2l cooking oil.... Ama cooking oil awasakwani kuma plastic bags or its show off? @NoChillinByo
1543 2018-10-21 20:38:32 You are welcome. But Do Not use any oil or wax stain in the timber before you use the Osmo oil, as it won’t set. It needs to be a completely clean & dry surface. Let me know how you get on & if you need any other help, give me a shout 
1544 2018-10-21 20:38:31 I want you to play w my yeahhh but Don’t you play w my head , coconut oil for the  back massage come and lay in my bed
1545 2018-10-21 20:38:28 I can never get used to that  Cooking oil’s name. Pure Drop? Yikes. Nobody told them what ‘drop’ is?
1546 2018-10-21 20:38:06 Hi!  :D just usual flavours -- grated fresh ginger, minced garlic, sugar, soy sauce and sesame oil.
1547 2018-10-21 20:38:00 Liars. The only reason the US hasn't gone in to take the oil is due to their payoffs to the US. Trump is he worst of the bunch.
1548 2018-10-21 20:37:59 Tonight, @OilCapsHockey vs. Portage Terriers at the Tundra in Virden...GO OIL CAPS GO!!!!!!!

1550 2018-10-21 20:37:53 You guys going  are so stupid. Biocheese is dairy free cheese made with coconut oil. Dairy cheese is milk curds from a different species. But sure, keep eating it and heightening your estrogen levels and increasing your infertility, you beta males.
1551 2018-10-21 20:37:46 I think government is failing on two counts in dealing with financial matters first is declining value of Indian rupiah and increase in oil prices
1552 2018-10-21 20:37:27 Some love cooking but no cooking oil
1553 2018-10-21 20:37:16 Quit playing games and politics. The USA CAN provide its own resources including oil, iron works ECT. No more being held hostage by other nations. @POTUS we are a sovereign nation. Start acting like it!!!!
1554 2018-10-21 20:37:15 #ASKTWAIMZ if vegetable oil is made of vegetables, and corn oil is made of corn, what is baby oil made out of?
1555 2018-10-21 20:37:12 my mom does that but she usually dilutes it a little bit with water so it’s not as strong, but still cleans well

I’m sure there’s some essential oil or something you could mix with it to help
1556 2018-10-21 20:36:54 Evening primrose oil & witch hazel will change ya life im tryna tell y’all
1557 2018-10-21 20:36:49 Thanking lucky stars I’m Gen X
1558 2018-10-21 20:36:47 Here’s the deal. As long as the powers that be determine that Saudi oil, millions for our military equipment and expertise as well as a counterweight to Iran’s power are more important than journalists getting murdered then nothing will change.
1559 2018-10-21 20:36:44 And also note Harper’s sole experience in the private sector was a stint at Impetial Oil. 
Trudeau has managed to avoid plunging us into a recession - not bad considering Harper was an economist by training.

1561 2018-10-21 20:36:39 The Left & Media thinks they have an issue that will hurt Trump-the death of Washington Post writer-If he goes to easy on the Saudis OR if he comes down hard. Human rights VS USA arms deal (jobs) & higher oil/gas prices. What they care most about is scoring political points...
1562 2018-10-21 20:36:20 That’s a good thought. Definitely something that you should be heading for. But the reality is America has enough oil. This is about  The American economy. Making money off weapon sales.
1563 2018-10-21 20:36:16 No navy in the world could defend it against the US Navy. But the Red Sea is a major choke point, eg oil tankers. It would be a major 'strategic' problem if hostile navy controlled it. This is why the Germans/Brits were fighting in North Africa. It's a historical fact.
1564 2018-10-21 20:36:14 You are right, CBD oil has no THC in it (the bit that gets you high) and is good for pain relief. There MAY be other effects.
1565 2018-10-21 20:35:54 Why the FUCK haven’t I invested in gas and oil yet?
1566 2018-10-21 20:35:53 Oil. Its all about having an assured and cheap source of supply. If Iran had more reserves, rest assured that US would have been playing Iran against the Saudis.
1567 2018-10-21 20:35:46 Well if feel free to pimp it! She has another ready for me to digitise and a couple of paper prints I need to find a printer for. The canvas that’s up was a few months of work cause its oil.
1568 2018-10-21 20:35:25 Wow. All those things he did are healthy. Cannabis oil can be effective. But neither of those is gonna stop those cells reproducing and neither of those is actually gonna cure cancer. Believing it is its like believing dancing works to get rain.
1569 2018-10-21 20:35:09 Pretty far out. If that assertion were true, the Saudi government would have been overthrown several times during the oil embargoes of the last century.
1570 2018-10-21 20:34:58 What. What are we going to do? I suggest invading the country, taking over the oil and expelling the royal inbreds. Can't do that. The Russians would support them. Any effective measures on our part will raise the price of oil. They could stop selling us oil.  Yeah we got 'em..

1577 2018-10-21 20:34:00 Oil and Gas industry dumping money into ads to defeat any kind of regulation.

What is sad is that it is probably going to work.
1578 2018-10-21 20:33:54 State roads are funded by gas taxes, fees & tolls but is not indexed for inflation. Following your logic using your example, you should be pro-Democrat which seeks to increase oil/gas tax for infrastructure improvements.
1579 2018-10-21 20:33:53 Absolutely how about AOC? Or how about Beto? Or how about the whole Democratic Party flirting with not taking money from big oil?
1580 2018-10-21 20:33:43 add oilなんて誰が使ってるかもわからん英単語を入れて中国に媚び売らんでいいから。urban dictionaryにも入って実際に使われてるpangsaiを入れろ
1581 2018-10-21 20:33:43 I have been saying for a while, if we have to align with a country ruled by theocrats that is a state sponsor of terrorism and has oil, why not the one that didn't do 9/11?
1582 2018-10-21 20:33:32 Germany get their oil from Russia!

1584 2018-10-21 20:32:45 Saturate hair with oil (warm or not) before you wash, let sit for 30 minutes to hour. Proceed to shampoo hair in downwards motion comb or finger comb, once done deep condition. Leave on for 15 minutes or hr. Then rinse out with cold water. This makes a huge difference.
1585 2018-10-21 20:32:38 Just had hot oil dropped on my head how's your day going 
1586 2018-10-21 20:32:31 A just the oil that holds American president to the saudis.

1588 2018-10-21 20:32:23 I mean I can just rub oil on myself lmao
1589 2018-10-21 20:32:14 I paint oil on canvas - love to buy new (more) brushes for different applications - good one's are expensive - up to $100 but worth it they last a lifetime. Forgot - canvas's. When my supplier has a sale I buy several, the studio getting crowded. Should'a said something girly
1590 2018-10-21 20:32:04 Define what u believe a conservative is. Was it an R or D president who first went after Standard oil. Is Bill Kristol a conservative to you. Will you even acknowledge that China seeks toDOMINATE the globe not share it with idiot globalists

1594 2018-10-21 20:31:30 Why don’t we look at using BTC for large scale commodity contracts, oil, minerals, grain, etc. EU already looking at moving away from USD but Euro not stable in the long term. BTC much better for larger contracts than pizzas! How could we push this?

1617 2018-10-21 20:29:00 There is so much more your govt could be doing. All infrastructure spending should be tied to being ‘green’. Bridges that include wind turbines in the support structure, rooftop gardens on buildings etc. And STOP subsidizing oil & gas. Really disappointed in you
1618 2018-10-21 20:28:59 Even though if would traumatize everyone, I hope the Turkish gov releases some of the audio/ video- (not most gruesome parts). But- bigger picture- how does new SOCAR gas pipeline call Blue Stream into EU factor? I mean, all Saudi cares abt is U$D oil dependenc #QUIT #ColdTurkey
1619 2018-10-21 20:28:51 Potus and there is more than just one bad man to wry about. We need Saudi Arabia for oil and to protect Israel. So it's bad and say it's bad but do little behind the seens
1620 2018-10-21 20:28:46 I have had insomnia since  birth, now i take cbd oil and 400 mgs.

Charlotte's  Web or CBDPure are good companies
1621 2018-10-21 20:28:39 Gas and oil have long been the pursuit of government, just look at us in the US and our history with the commodity. It's just one reason why we need to shift away from fossil fuel energy dependency

1624 2018-10-21 20:28:30 That last caller likes to edit out the truth. The facts are that there is a 5th season in the West: fire season. We must retrain workers to transition out of the oil and gas industry... not make excuses as to why we can't.
1625 2018-10-21 20:28:28 When I was about eight, I pointed out that I could see a rainbow on the pavement. My friend's mum chastised me saying "don't be stupid, it's just an oil leak".

Feel free to share a time when humourless, unimaginative adults eroded some of the magic of your childhood.
1626 2018-10-21 20:28:15 Thats why Obama let Standing Rock happen, cops cracking bones and water cannon in freezing temps, all at the behest of big oil corporations.

1629 2018-10-21 20:27:45 Riffing on a point made at the @des4div talk, "data is the new oil" is fitting in its way of dismissing the debt of cultural exploitation required for mining and profiting from both. #nela2018

1636 2018-10-21 20:26:10 " No, pretty much the only one is with the other Mr. Game and Watch. She's still mad at me for what happened in ' Oil Panic '. "
1637 2018-10-21 20:25:53 oh no dude, my friend got some peppermint oil and would semi soak it in cotton and then put it directly on the tooth/gum and would leave it there and it would help the pain. salt/coconut oil rinses with warm water help too i've heard
1638 2018-10-21 20:25:52 Olive Oil and Margarine is healthier. #BoycottLandOLakes
1639 2018-10-21 20:25:48 The quality of the frying oil, how long they've gone without changing the oil, too long cooking, low quality chicken.
1640 2018-10-21 20:25:39 Actually Canada does not require Saudi oil at all.  We have more than enough here.  As for people, got that covered.  The religious entitlement is really showing with your comment.
1641 2018-10-21 20:25:15 What do think of promoting Bitcoin to pay for large commodity contracts? Oil, minerals, etc. EU looking to switch away from the dollar but Euro not exactly stable in the long term and Bitcoin could be a great alternative. How do we promote this?
1642 2018-10-21 20:25:12 @CBD_Support can you DM me, so I can send you my phone number, just ordered some CBD oil and want to pay for it 
1643 2018-10-21 20:24:57 Squirrel Oil Index = High
1644 2018-10-21 20:24:43 If you want to slow down the increasing instability in the Middle East, invest in Green Energy. Make the oil companies obsolete
1645 2018-10-21 20:24:31 Most nations would soon agree that the dollar is worthless, since it is endlessly printed for warmaking while the US produces less and less, Except they Must accept the Petrodollar or they get no oil, and collapse. That's the Real reason every President kneels and kisses the ass
1646 2018-10-21 20:24:20 Just bought the only container of palm oil at my local health food store..(Soup emoji)
1647 2018-10-21 20:24:12 and when they admit they murdered him and cut him up in their own embassy and that MBS ordered the hit, maybe THEN we will applaud their disgusting horseshit. for now, they can go get stuffed. we have plenty of our own oil. time to cut ALL ties with the asshat 'kingdom'. the end.
1648 2018-10-21 20:23:35 So, to keep score: statement 1 isn’t true (OK’s budgetary woes started when oil prices plummeted), statement 2 indicates ignorance as to how exchange grants can be used, and statement 3 is you trying to avoid confronting the fact that oil & gas supported Stitt’s opponent.
1649 2018-10-21 20:23:35 you probably shouldnt and are better drinking straight up car oil so
1650 2018-10-21 20:23:33 You were the one who introduced "hitting the bottom of the pan" I thought that was an oil change reference...
1651 2018-10-21 20:23:06 What is the relative quality of oil from Iraq and Iran? 

Also Syria and Yemen (apparently there's much more there than is usually thought).
1652 2018-10-21 20:22:55 Guest Geoff Dembicki: Shell sold off its investments in oil and gas. We're talking about huge numbers of jobs being lost from Shell's decision. Instead people are upset over the protesting of a pipeline.
1653 2018-10-21 20:22:50 You’d have to make do or better still coconut oil?
1654 2018-10-21 20:22:34 Cheques not checks. That’s how they roll. Bank balances not legal balances. That’s how things get sorted. They are an oppressive hero to tart absolutist monarchy that crushes democratic principles dead, brutally so some times. But they have oil. For now.
1655 2018-10-21 20:22:34 she's no oil painting
1656 2018-10-21 20:22:20 How much carbon would be eliminated if we stopped bringing over tankers of oil from Over seas?

1660 2018-10-21 20:21:33 That’s weak af.. when I had to be in there it was mandatory we shave in case a gas leak we’d have to mask up especially i was welding all the gas and oil pipes
1661 2018-10-21 20:20:51 #EverybodyTalks #AskTwitter @TheTalkCBS I use my oven a lot to keep my house a little warm instead of using my house heat to save heating oil
1662 2018-10-21 20:20:50 Guest Geoff Dembicki: The important thing is to look at what the larger fossil fuel industry is saying about oil sands. Shell, one of the largest fossil fuels companies, decided to divest from oil sands.
1663 2018-10-21 20:20:44 can i put soup in my essential oil diffuser?
1664 2018-10-21 20:20:32 Canada is unfeasible as a country if we do not develop oil sands #climateChange #climateHoax @checkupcbc #cdnpoli
1665 2018-10-21 20:20:00 Yes, all Xtians nations are prosperous.... Forget them, even oil rich Islamic nations are struggling as citizens r lazy & hardly educated n capable of handling own matters.
1666 2018-10-21 20:19:47 Here’s the deal. As long as the powers that be determine that Saudi oil, millions for our military equipment and expertise as well as a counterweight to Iran’s power are more important than journalists getting murdered then nothing will change.
1667 2018-10-21 20:19:39 Awesome! Which team would you like to see against the Mighty Oil!?
1668 2018-10-21 20:19:29 A Saudi official actually threatened with $200/barrel when they were still denying it, the current price isn't so far off $100/barrel, but I honestly think US isn't dependent on Saudi oil, we adapt fast too.
1669 2018-10-21 20:19:14 Or oil and big business.

1673 2018-10-21 20:18:38 Yeah, the US government is tied to the Saudis, we've become to dependent on their oil, presidents have no leverage unless they wanna cut ties and crumble our economy.  And stop with the ageism you tankie!

1677 2018-10-21 20:18:18 I called CVS to ask a clerk if they sold peppermint oil and cypress oil . The clerk said she didn’t know, but that they had plenty of essential oils . I said “okay do you know which oils you do have” she said “we have several, if you come in and look in our front row, you’ll see”

1679 2018-10-21 20:18:13 Treasury reports US 2018 deficit up 17%, corporate tax payments down 31%.  China has stopped buying US oil.  Arms deals prioritized over human rights with Saudis.

1682 2018-10-21 20:17:54 So far today, I’ve opened a door onto my toe (beyond painful), bit a chunk out of my cheek (eating a Curly Wurly) and splashed hot oil in my eye (my good one)!! #HappySunday
1683 2018-10-21 20:17:39 If I break your heart na oil spillage .
1684 2018-10-21 20:17:15 Renewables just so happen to reduce emissions too. 

The biggest conflict at grassroots level is the prospect of foregone jobs, e.g. in oil and gas. But good news there - renewables don't mean less jobs, they mean MORE jobs, and good paying ones at that!
1685 2018-10-21 20:17:12 You’re being used by that snake oil salesman in the White House too.
1686 2018-10-21 20:16:54 oil talks , money talks... shame #Khashoggi . And this is not the worst Saudi Arabia has done, their actions in #Yemen are such a disgrace..

1688 2018-10-21 20:16:47 God avenges from Saudi Arabia and to God How do I think Trump be finns and kill the Saud and give oil money to all the poor of America How do you do not benefit the Arabs from here kill Yemen and its people Annexes in the embassy of their country a journalist cut and throw in ,

1702 2018-10-21 20:15:42 We can pay as a society - for example, by building out renewable energy like wind, solar, and battery storage. What do we get for our investment? Longer term reductions in energy prices, and improved national security as we aren't dependent on oil imports

1715 2018-10-21 20:14:15 For years Venezuela had a surplus due to oil production. They squandered the money leaving them vulnerable. It was the extreme brand of socialist/Marxist policies. Stop trying to justify their failure. You are a typical apologist. Ask the flood of refugees why they are leaving?
1716 2018-10-21 20:14:04 Our Canadian energy & manufacturing sectors pay billions each year for environmental purposes.  With oil & gas generally paying the majority.   We also have some of the safest & most ethical oil on the planet.
1717 2018-10-21 20:13:57 Have you not done any research on cannabis oil? It’s helped a lot of people and not it’s starting to be introduced into the UK. But it has helped many people who suffer from cancer also, children included.
1718 2018-10-21 20:13:50 What's your opinion on ingesting it? I recently used it for a mouth problem. It worked. It says on the bottle not to ingest it , but it was 100% oil.
1719 2018-10-21 20:13:49 Your government officials said about ten times that by November 4, we will bring Iran's oil exports to zero, if you break your promise, they will all mock you. Exempting oil sanctions is a big betrayal for all freebies. People do not vote for wrongdoers and lying.

1738 2018-10-21 20:11:59 Yeah maybe. I don't know. But there was no manifesto, so nothing to hold anyone to. It was just snake oil all round, both sides. The only one who was actually honest was Corbyn who said the EU isn't perfect but can be reformed best from within.

1774 2018-10-21 20:07:38 My condolences 
Hard times indeed,

1775 2018-10-21 20:07:33 The whole #JamalKhashoggi gruesome murder story, is just a mirror, meant to display the nakedness of our values : oil and military industries are above any human value, any sense of dignity. And Trump is the perfect example.
1776 2018-10-21 20:07:25 What kind does she use? Can only find hemp oil on amazon & read they are different?
1777 2018-10-21 20:07:22 I guess you can say that. I put it on the stove and added a little olive oil.
1778 2018-10-21 20:07:05 did anyone else use baby oil to take off their makeup in middle school?
1779 2018-10-21 20:06:57 This tea tree oil is burning my face but I want clear skin asap smh 
1780 2018-10-21 20:06:45 legit just castor oil, lots of it on before bed and like massaging into ur skin
1781 2018-10-21 20:06:44 Getting my car fixed and my oil change appointment is Tuesday  finally ! It took me forever to do this lol just lazy

1783 2018-10-21 20:06:27 Yes, edible, CBD oil, vape pen, depends on how you would like it.. some edibles have more flavour than others...
1784 2018-10-21 20:06:26 Family and money mix like oil and water. They don't
1785 2018-10-21 20:06:21 Hope u talk about Saudis accepting CNY for oil and its implications...
1786 2018-10-21 20:06:19 It's only creepy until you pnderstand that "democracy and the american way of life" means unfettered access to cheap oil and lifetime republican rule.
1787 2018-10-21 20:06:10 olive oil + pesto >
1788 2018-10-21 20:06:04 Car was leaking oil, turns out I managed to puncture a hole in the oil filter. Which means my car and I have a striking similarity: quite a shit filter.
1789 2018-10-21 20:05:59 But it's bn sorted out
1790 2018-10-21 20:05:45 Western’s 18000 used same heavy fuel oil as GWR’s oil-fired steam locomotives. 18100 and GT3 used similar fuels to aviation turbines.
1791 2018-10-21 20:05:23 @realDonaldTrump is a pushover for rich Saudis. A strong man would bomb the hell out of Saudi Arabia and take their oil. Let's see if they even know how to use the weapons we sell them. BTW the deal is only $4 billion NOT $100 billion. We could profit greater by destroying them.
1792 2018-10-21 20:05:11 Every nation should freeze arm deals with Saudi. Shove their oil too. We don't need anything from their government!
1793 2018-10-21 20:05:03 I’d prefer Eakins but I’m afraid the Oil will be tapping him soon

1796 2018-10-21 20:04:37 Though I see more people goin to jail if they refuse to vomit d wealth of Nigerians in their stomach!

Meanwhile, stop deceiving urself that oil will remain #145 for d next 10 yrs bcos u were told #145 will end subsidy. So what do u want frm govt? They should pass d subsidy to u?
1797 2018-10-21 20:04:35 Oh, the humanity!  Millions of people starving/children dying in Yemen, all with USA's blessings ... and you're worried about gas prices??
We can not only buy oil elsewhere, we can move OFF fossil fuels entirely. #OFFAct #HR3671
1798 2018-10-21 20:04:21 Of course they have benefited, no one is saying they haven't. But most agree that we have to move on. We don't really have a choice. The more help the better. As for coal and natural gas, that too. In BC there is a growing resistance/protests to these as well. It's not just oil.

1800 2018-10-21 20:04:20 The deep state (oil) agenda about what to do to the Saudi, has been revel years ago already by pastor #LyndseyWilliams The Syrian adventure had been stop by Putin, and has delay the calendar.. Its coming.. trashing the Saudi back to the desert...
1801 2018-10-21 20:04:20 God said in Psalms, “Touch not My anointed.” You are His anointed NOT some water and oil selling, false prophecy declaring and women abusing man of God...
1802 2018-10-21 20:04:10 Not sure how I feel about the potential Saudi takeover. On one hand it'd be mint to have owners that would actually act like the richest club in the world but on the other hand it sort of feels like the authenticity of our club is that we don't spend oil money but our own money.
1803 2018-10-21 20:04:06 Don't Dig it so Deep. Not A big deal. Let the OiL prices stay LoW, $0 Arabs don't profiT extra Billions of Dollars from OiL.
1804 2018-10-21 20:04:05 It is very sad that the so-called religious countries & fanaticisms are the trouble makers globally and killers of innocent people. Arabs are savages thanks to Oil money. They don't care about human rights. Some black Africans domestic workers are easily killed for tiny error.
1805 2018-10-21 20:04:03 Just had the most repetitive shit, but amisom or jubbaland or NFD or the four case by Kenya towards Somalia’s oil rich sea territory- ok I guys defo have ur priorities straight 
1806 2018-10-21 20:03:57 Oh i guess you should put human rights in front of a few barrels of oil..
1807 2018-10-21 20:03:33 Two seasons ago, conte was urging the fans to cheer there team up again Utd and he started complaining,that same season he beat Cfc at old Trafford and was beating man u badge in front of Cfc fans. No hate campaign against  him.
1808 2018-10-21 20:03:24 How can he do all of that while on some crazy tour, and Congress is out of session? He is just selling snake oil. #trumptheliarinchief
1809 2018-10-21 20:03:19 My man that is sad. I can get cooking oil for $2.00 and to see people lining up like that and police officers with K9 units is saddening.The US administration @WhiteHouse and @USAID should offer some assistance and step in as this could spiral into a humanitarian crisis.

1813 2018-10-21 20:02:52 Don't worry, he'll make a lot of money as a lobbyist for big oil.
1814 2018-10-21 20:02:45 No one was enslaved when we were a colony. Everyone was free to do whatever they wanted. Guess Guyana is hoping to attract golfers when all that oil money comes pouring in. In the meantime water and electricity not avail 24/7 in some places. Priorities
1815 2018-10-21 20:02:29 I’m glad you’re saying this, but when 9/11 happened we should have said it then, but money and oil are all powerful to those who control this nation.

1818 2018-10-21 20:01:49 But given the sharp increases in #oil prices over the last year, the impact on the #Iranian government revenue will not be as large as in 2013. #OOTT

1820 2018-10-21 20:01:38 exactly.  Add up gas and oil and brakes for the next 2 years when deciding. 
1821 2018-10-21 20:01:38 do you ever just walk across  trenches between metres of oil which is supposed to be an art piece to flex on dan howell 
1822 2018-10-21 20:01:36 How was the economy when @Chief_Obasanjo  took over from the military? How much was a barrel of crude oil? If under @OfficialPDPNig  we had the fatest growing economy in Africa, how wrong was that? In terms of privatisation, Is it bad for @govt to privatise what she can't handle?
1823 2018-10-21 20:01:32 It's DEFINITELY the money. These are the top two oil producers in the world. We're talking MASSIVE, MASSIVE money.
1824 2018-10-21 20:01:09 What is Canada going to do about it? Stop the oil immediately!
Let’s use Canada’s oil!

1829 2018-10-21 20:00:48 It’s clear that no one in the US administration believes that #Iran’s #oil exports will go to zero or anywhere close to zero. The unilateral US #sanctions will at most bring oil exports (in barrels) to the same level as the last sanctions.

1836 2018-10-21 20:00:16 Britain built an empire & the first industrial revolution on coal. Norway built an oil fund topping $1 trillion on hydrocarbon exploratn. Our oil discovry was the best thing that could happn to any country but then we abandond other export resourcs & fed fat on easy petro dollars
1837 2018-10-21 20:00:14 All military industrial complex work same way ur big oil and weapons company start war to make big bucks kill millions u lost Vietnam Iraq Syria Afghanistan ur military industrial complex made billions on ur tax money and what u got, u won’t b a superpower in next 20 years
1838 2018-10-21 20:00:08 Oil changes are too expensive 
1839 2018-10-21 20:00:01 We have bases around the world for geopolitical control, global strike capability, and for troop training/readiness. They kind of have an old world mentality and still want buffer states to protect from invasion. Their ex-soviet Asian allies have oil and rare minerals. (1)

1853 2018-10-21 19:59:01 Maybe BTC snake oil sellers

1855 2018-10-21 19:58:50 I took some of that CBD oil and I just accidentally pushed my neighbor's house off it's foundation
1856 2018-10-21 19:58:44 The news of the Saudi Prince potentially taking over United is such a catch 22. Want the Glazers out as quick as possible but dunno if I can take the level of hypocrisy that comes from our fans after slagging City for years over oil money

1858 2018-10-21 19:58:16 My baobab oil just poured everywhere 
1859 2018-10-21 19:58:14 Me too. And we're going to be worse than tired. We're going to be drought-stricken, messed up, burning in fires, and very hungry. All b/c Cons - who are friends with oil producers - prevented necessary action in time!  It wouldn't cost us that much either. SAVE OUR KIDS!
1860 2018-10-21 19:58:02 We have our own poor that they refuse to take care of, too. All to feed the oil machine and line pockets.

1872 2018-10-21 19:56:51 We are almost there....debt service ratio approaching 70%....just let oil price fall below $50 then Nigerians will understand the true meaning of anarchy. Funny thing is these clowns now seem to know what’s up, they are planning for a smaller budget in 2019....hilarious.
1873 2018-10-21 19:56:50 So you didnt comprehend the piece.

I"t seems a drop in oil prices are the main driver of Russia’s problems. But sanctions play at least some role — though it’s hard to evaluate exactly how much given the country’s oil crisis. "
1874 2018-10-21 19:56:38 My second question. What happened to America first? 

Why does the right suddenly care about South America? Do you really care that much about oil deals and weapons manufacturers?
1875 2018-10-21 19:56:28 I thought we are oil independent now. Let’s start working harder on alternatives.
1876 2018-10-21 19:56:17 Water, fine.. we need to not be having oil pipelines

1884 2018-10-21 19:55:13 Maybe we should develop our oil, now....
1885 2018-10-21 19:55:05 I’m not sure how...we don’t need their oil and we have a 2.5 billion dollar trade DEFICIT with them. We sell them arms, they sell them to rebel factions in Syria/Yemen and help destabilize the Middle East which increases our military spending there. What’s in it for us?
1886 2018-10-21 19:55:03 I still think any disruption in the oil market over this is highly highly unlikely.
1887 2018-10-21 19:54:55 If you can't handle the heat, get out of the kitchen- or you will end up with a 3rd degree oil burn- it's so simple!
1888 2018-10-21 19:54:53 Is the buyer of Ajaokuta not meant to make it work? This is how the ND and Nigeria lost out on the sale of the oil refineries. 8 years after so much money has been wasted on the refineries, no result. If NNPC can't work till now, does it not mean we need another mode of thinking?
1889 2018-10-21 19:54:51 He deserves to boast ai, there is a hate campaign against him
1890 2018-10-21 19:54:26 Would be interesting to see a historic chart silver to oil ratio. We know it takes about 5 oz of silver to buy a barrel of Brent crude but how many barrels of Brent does it take to produce 5 oz of silver. Silver is the canary in the coal mine to shows how wildly overpriced USD is
1891 2018-10-21 19:54:09 One day the oil in the Middle East will be gone ; good to control the land of kuffars by then
1892 2018-10-21 19:54:06 I finally proved that the electric charge is quantized, that there was a smallest unit of charge. I calculated 1.602176487(40) ×10−19 C as the charge of a single electron. I calculated the weight of an oil drop with the help of terminal velocity of freely falling oil drop.

1898 2018-10-21 19:53:27 He is boastful,
1899 2018-10-21 19:53:13 Sis, you could have kept this to yourself... He continued to put himself in a hot kitchen, with a whole lot of boiling oil. After he found himself getting burned, he decided to blame the cooks  who told him to get out of the mfkin kitchen. He got what he wanted,now he has to deal
1900 2018-10-21 19:52:58 The Nimbys and Swampies have had their fun . Even Fracking now given the UK Gov green light

There are only 2 weeks ahead of #Iran #sanctions coming into effect on November 4. Expect the volatility picks up the momentum during this period. Be cautious if losing money is not an option at all.

1908 2018-10-21 19:52:26 I agree about Tulsi, not Saudi Arabia. We don't need to side w/their Sunni/Shia war, nor support the genocide in Yemen, nor support someone who spreads extremist Wahhabism, world-wide. We can not only buy oil elsewhere but we can move OFF fossil fuels. Check out #HR3671
1909 2018-10-21 19:52:26 Gold diggers dig until they find oil
1910 2018-10-21 19:52:18 He obviously doesn't have a clue about the politics of religion and the middle East. For sure, oil and power are always factors, but everything political in the middle East is religious in all ways.
1911 2018-10-21 19:51:59 Because thats what our car dealers tell us to do? I think most oil is now full synth. Also 60% of cars are diesels so that might make a difference.
1912 2018-10-21 19:51:55 Gosh just think if we did not depend on their oil ?We might just have some leverage ...Oh never mind.Climate Fraud and hated Alberta and all that #cndpoli
1913 2018-10-21 19:51:52 Love is oil you need

1916 2018-10-21 19:51:29 The #NastyParty is so tied to oil that they do everything they can to stop renewables
1917 2018-10-21 19:51:26 How revealing to see Zinke the thug using thugs to limit citizen queries into his role in giving parks over to the oil and timber interests. Beyond the awful appearance he's accused of corruption.
1918 2018-10-21 19:51:17 when the time comes, always put olive oil after washing
1919 2018-10-21 19:51:03 Toast with olive oil & some ground black pepper?
1920 2018-10-21 19:50:52 Correct on both fronts
1921 2018-10-21 19:50:44 Today is the day I learn how to change my oil in my truck 
1922 2018-10-21 19:50:40 You would be surprised how much they care. You are talking about people running companies that have families as well. I have worked in the US. We crush them for oil patch environmental stewardship. Middle East and Africa are not even in the conversation.
1923 2018-10-21 19:50:33 If there are sanctions on the Saudis and they retaliate by cutting oil production we would get a gigantic rally in oil prices.

1925 2018-10-21 19:50:20 Our own GOP Republican president sides with Saudi even after they murder an American. Because of greed and corruption and oil. This is the Republicans for you. Greed, corruption oil and coal. They don’t care about public health and our planet.
1926 2018-10-21 19:50:04 Lame
1927 2018-10-21 19:50:03 Trump or Bon Jovi still interested? I mean how can this get worse? Time to go drill more oil wells and vacate Pegulaville.
1928 2018-10-21 19:50:00 While the NDP is avoiding open nominations and promoting radical members who want to diversify the economy instead of praying to white Jesus (tm) that we get another oil boom, we wil continue to fill our party with wholesome old stock fascist bigots, misogynist and homophobes.
1929 2018-10-21 19:49:57 Oil changes are a snap on the new 2018 Shiba.
1930 2018-10-21 19:49:52 @FLOURNOYFarrell Both Shiite majority countries, IRAQ & IRAN have 100 times more untapped oil/gas reserves than SAUDI ARABIA & the UAE. SAUDI ARABIA supported SADDAM HUSSEIN and his REGIME because they were SUNNI.
1931 2018-10-21 19:49:46 @BuffRumblings @buffalobills  Horrific pass. Bring in Peterman!  LOL, LOL.  #Flutie still around?  I bet Kyle Williams is wondering how he fell for the snake oil sale to play another year.
1932 2018-10-21 19:49:38 Aha... The Shale Oil boom. Even the Democrats seem to be loosening their stance against fossil fuels. Oil is now the geopolitical tool of choice.
1933 2018-10-21 19:49:17 no red tape, no nimby's and a fully supportive government that desperately need the gas!

Developing a huge oil field in the back yard of where many UK govt and council members live is going to be a struggle. Surrey Hills are area of "outstanding natural beauty" after all..
1934 2018-10-21 19:49:12 僕を酸化させたらダメだよ。オイルにとって酸化は命取り。…僕を見守っててね⁇
1935 2018-10-21 19:49:07 Yah no - have u been watching the stock market go down or pondering the oil pipe problem or Seeing Doug Ford piss away 3.6 billion because he thinks Climate change is Bs ,or how bout likely cancelation of Sadi truck deal not 2 mention US tariffs & midterms? - what a headache 
1936 2018-10-21 19:48:54 Who cares, we might have enough money to pay more taxes if JT would quit supporting Saudi oil & refine Canadian oil instead. All we have to do is build a pipeline across   Quebec. You know the ones with their hands out for transfer payments.
1937 2018-10-21 19:48:43 Honestly, it’s one of her jobs.She understands that based on the viscosity of the protein rich nut oil paste, the likelihood of sink drain adhesion and future restriction could result in costly repair bills.Therefore she must “take the hit” by cleaning the implement. It’s heroic.
1938 2018-10-21 19:48:40 Phew, talk about empty minds. I sure can see how CC is totally responsible for climate change (which according to the GOP doesn’t exist), as opposed to, say, the coal industry, or oil and gas conglomerates.  But by all means, don’t let scientific evidence influence you in any way
1939 2018-10-21 19:48:37 My generation has been waiting for electric vehicles since 1990! Tech for these vehicles is way older, suppressed by oil industry shitbags! The model 3 is out soon! Trading my hybrid for fully electric car!
1940 2018-10-21 19:48:16 Trump is just a lowly retainer for the House of Saud. Kind of like with the Bush family except Trump was much farther down the totem pole, being nothing more than a convenient landlord who doesn't know jack shit about the oil business.
1941 2018-10-21 19:48:10 @Kohler what’s with the #neoroc sink? Worst sink I have ever had! After every use I have to oil it down to keep it from looking  old and “ashy”. A sink really shouldn’t be a high maintenance item.
1942 2018-10-21 19:48:06 I’m FINALLY getting an oil 

1943 2018-10-21 19:48:05 I love that i get free oil changes that come in so clutch 
1944 2018-10-21 19:47:57 *shinnies up a flagpole.* Don't worry Miss I will have you free in a jiffy. *squirts mineral oil on to the ponies hooves.* Terribly sorry. I am not sure who spilled Mighty Glue up here.
1945 2018-10-21 19:47:41 Personal opinion: for decades and decades and decades, our different societies have prioritized Nations, Military, Oil, Automobiles, Wealth, Banks, Industry... all of this over mass Education. Cooperation and Knowledge transmission/exchange was maybe the real value of Humanity
1946 2018-10-21 19:47:32 Never again, sanity must return, operation sweep has bn launched.
1947 2018-10-21 19:47:29 Abanye bebe se layinini ye fuel, cooking oil, mazoe etc
1948 2018-10-21 19:46:58 Okay, weird recipe that strangely works:
ramen with a can of sardines in soybean oil
I'm serious: you get protein, a little vegetable and fish oil, and carbs. Have it with a V8 or some fruit and some dairy, and you have a square meal.
Sardines are smokey, meaty, and sweet.
1949 2018-10-21 19:46:51 rub me down in that oil
1950 2018-10-21 19:46:49 Yep. Oil and coal dependency driven by greed and corruption will be our undoing.
1951 2018-10-21 19:46:40 Where in Antigua sells cannabis oil/products?
1952 2018-10-21 19:46:39 I always wondered why the movie #Christine changed the manufacturer of the car from a ford to a Chevy?
1953 2018-10-21 19:46:10 Big Oil is behind most of the hate for Musk and his EV’s.
1954 2018-10-21 19:46:09 The ghost of Vontae Davis is in Lucas Oil Stadium today
1955 2018-10-21 19:46:08 Seismic...

- End of supermarket discount wars

- Increasing oil price

- Increasing interest rates

- Lower AUD

- Falling property prices

Negative wealth effect across  arrived with impending cash flow crunch..

1956 2018-10-21 19:46:03 Sadly, nothing will change because - at present - every country needs Saudi oil. Western countries always talk about supporting democracy. Er, when was Saudi Arabia ever a democracy? But West has always been perfectly happy to trade & sell arms to the Kingdom! I wonder why...?!
1957 2018-10-21 19:46:01 Merkel buys oil from Russia who has killed ??? In UK, yet is concerned about Saudi Arabia?  Any concern for 4 Americans in Benghazi ?  Guess she’s on who’s side of killings?
1958 2018-10-21 19:45:50 What's your observation
1959 2018-10-21 19:45:21 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1960 2018-10-21 19:45:19 THE @saudiarabia KINGDOM STORY RAISED FROM THE LATE KING FAISAL WHO  BLOCKED OIL TO WEST & WAS ASSASSINATED IN 1975.
AFTER SAUDI RULERS & ROYAL FAMILIES IN FEAR FALLS IN ARMS OF US & BECOME CLOSED ALLY!
LEFT ISLAMIC BLOCK? INDULGED IN WAR TORN IN ARABS NOW TIME TO TEST AGAIN???
1961 2018-10-21 19:45:10 くそっくそっくそっ
1962 2018-10-21 19:45:04 Proof just came back into style
1963 2018-10-21 19:45:03 The MZ was the same if it was too hot the petrol vaporized in the carb...always had to rock the bike to mix the oil and petrol in the tank...
1964 2018-10-21 19:44:58 I rlly just fucked up my @UGG boots with oil  I’m sick asf rn.
1965 2018-10-21 19:44:49 Funny the state legislature had banned it, then restored it and both dnc and gop approved it. Makes no sense especially since it was restored after the BP oil disaster. 
Foreign corporations are getting rich and harming our gulf. I think the”red tied” is actually a symptom of it.
1966 2018-10-21 19:44:48 Where can I find a man who can build a house, complete an oil change, and plan a date on his own?
1967 2018-10-21 19:44:46 The same applies to crypto. Ppl should be able to distinguish real project from the snake oil that’s circulating. To me, DYOR is not a statement expecting that everyone should be an expert. It just states that everyone should be making informed descicions by themselves.
1968 2018-10-21 19:44:46 Why not have a oil browser in Brussels, trading oil in Euro? Europe and UK are still holding Iran agreement. Iran and Venezuela can also be allowed to trade oil, which make oil market competitive hence reduce monopoly of OPEC.

1970 2018-10-21 19:44:18 Seems education is not your strong point.. Here's thing oil... Worst E and P since 70s... Explain the revenue....
1971 2018-10-21 19:44:17 Dear Saudi Arabia, you’ve been been very naughty

Please can we have some more oil
1972 2018-10-21 19:44:07 The only thing worse than buying Saudi oil right now would be to get a pipeline from Alberta to New Brunswick & refine Canadian oil!
1973 2018-10-21 19:44:05 Dimanche tout le monde mange Macdo chez oil c’est le poulet du dimanche 
1974 2018-10-21 19:43:40 Ronald Reagan removed solar panels from the White House while Al Gore was still a lowly TN state rep. The Republicans have been in the pocket of oil and coal energy lobbies forever...long before Gore.
1975 2018-10-21 19:43:35 Typhoons will be delivered but price tag will be a bit higher, good opportunity to milk some oil $$$
1976 2018-10-21 19:43:33 Too busy buying oil from the Saudis
1977 2018-10-21 19:43:28 oil is a dying industry whether  people like it or not. If we spend billions...we'll either hasten earth's demise or we will have wasted money that we could have put into renewables instead.
1978 2018-10-21 19:43:26 @CountDankulaTV Florida or Texas. Man cheats on diet by breaking into a restaurant to drink frying oil. @tjkirk
1979 2018-10-21 19:43:24 It’s almost like if a WGR caller struck oil and bought the Bills and Sabres and now gets to make all the staffing decisions.
1980 2018-10-21 19:43:20 and that shell keeps dropping oil into the ocean
1981 2018-10-21 19:43:12 外くそ寒いけどまだ半ズボンで大丈夫そう
1982 2018-10-21 19:43:06 The real horrors this Halloween season are the fact that I’m officially adulting now. I just did my first oil change. AAAAA
1983 2018-10-21 19:43:06 We should take Saudi Arabia's oil.
1984 2018-10-21 19:42:46 What about oil exploration, it involved removing a source from the earth and not just below the surface. It is replaced by pumping something else into the void,  the density is different and so the layers can and do shift, therefore a state of instability is created.
1985 2018-10-21 19:42:40 Yes. BP Pride was represented in the London Pride parade and I went with them. I don't just generally walk around as an advertising board for oil multinationals.
1986 2018-10-21 19:42:37 They were cooked in extra virgin olive oil with red onions and soy sauce for added flavor. They were very tasty
1987 2018-10-21 19:42:22 Says the snake oil salesman!
1988 2018-10-21 19:42:11 Fresh cucumbers himalayan salt, 21 seasoning, olive oil and vinegar>>>

1990 2018-10-21 19:41:34 Pretty much. There will be glowing reviews of how great it is to work with these yentas and mental midgets every day, scared she might say the wrong thing. The fear is evident.
1991 2018-10-21 19:41:33 I love my new car and everything but the price for this oil change on max is gonna get outta hand
1992 2018-10-21 19:41:28 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower
1993 2018-10-21 19:41:26 Little update used cbd off @CBD_Support oil now for a week slept great all week 8 hrs uninterrupted every night my  mood def changed a little finding it easier to stay calm when the kids are trying to run riot lol prob to early to say if it’s helping  my shoulder heal though
1994 2018-10-21 19:41:07 Quick question - are malteser and galaxy choc palm oil free or using sustainable sources?
1995 2018-10-21 19:41:05 The price of oil - billy Bragg

1997 2018-10-21 19:40:59 微かな希望を与えるな
1998 2018-10-21 19:40:47 That's not lavender oil
1999 2018-10-21 19:40:45 And all done for oil - @BP_plc is now extracting as much oil as it can get its hands on in #Libya and all for free - I kid you not 
2000 2018-10-21 19:40:40 I've got family in AB.  I know they are good stewards of the environment though they are pro oil industry.  My issue isn't with Albertans but with those who run the industry who don't give a damn about the environment. They are the ones at the corporate level who care only 4 $$$

2002 2018-10-21 19:40:29 "Dias de la Morte" oil on canvas 36"x48". Oils are so hard to photograph especially if they're dark, arg! Oh well, was fun to paint...looks better in person. Thanks for the reference pic Debbie Shine!

2005 2018-10-21 19:40:27 Todd Lamb, Lt. Gov to @GovMaryFallin, the  who discovered how to bankrupt Oklahoma while oil sold for $100 barrel?  She who sent back a $56M grant during a budget shortfall  scored herself a seat at the @GOP adults table?

Oil demands those who serve themselves, like Stitt.
2006 2018-10-21 19:40:12 The world, out of the US, is waiting to buy #Model3. For couple years ahead you have to suffer from witnessing high revenue growth for #Tesla. There are lot of tasteful customers all over the world, eager to combat #ClimateChange damage unlike haters oil junkies in the USA

2014 2018-10-21 19:39:07 I already know.. kind of the same in the oil refinery... had to have that tight seal for your mask
2015 2018-10-21 19:39:05 US #globalists now issuing #Khashoggi-related ultimatums to the #Saudis shows the progress made twd independence from #MiddleEast #oil.  Couple that w/growing realization that #Iraq/#Libya-type interventions are insane, & the case for US regional disengagement just keeps growing.
2016 2018-10-21 19:38:49 He did nothing. He inherited at debt ratio of 31% after the Libs brought it down from Mulroney's high of 65%. He pushed that up to 34% during the down turn and left office with the same 31% he inherited. If it wasn't for record high oil prices it would have gone way up.
2017 2018-10-21 19:38:42 let's just close down the kingdom and they can play around with their oil and medieval ways
2018 2018-10-21 19:38:38 my little brother put that cbd oil stuff in my hot chocolate and now i cant move
2019 2018-10-21 19:38:34 Yessss. I still have two brownies left made with oil and finely grounded up shrooms. Wanna take a trip with me?

2022 2018-10-21 19:38:25 Are you serious?? You are now giving The Print link? I didn’t know you are someone who pushes political agenda. Have you heard of Policy paralysis? Have you heard of Oil bonds? Honest PM my foot.
2023 2018-10-21 19:37:59 Dummy.
Wages have decreased over the past 2 years when adjusted for inflation and the soaring price of consumer goods, gasoline, home heating oil and interest rates.
Dummy.
2024 2018-10-21 19:37:37 Capitalism? Markets? Competition? None of the above - they are all myths. Convenient lies the government tells the ignorant masses who believe in "greatness". There is only corrupt corporate welfare that we all subsidize whether its oil, manufacturing, power generation, or weapon

2029 2018-10-21 19:37:05 May ur oil never run dry
2030 2018-10-21 19:36:51 Withdrawal from #NuclearTreaty would be very dangerous step.Saudi & other regional powers would seek dual-use nuclear technology, China would likely be biggest economic beneficiary, Iran’s strategic alliance with Russia would deepen,oil prices wud rise further.Devastating  impact
2031 2018-10-21 19:36:51 @FLOURNOYFarrell IRAN will not abide by Trump-imposed sanctions & will sell its oil below SAUDI ARABIA's price. One way or another they will make the sanctions collapse, or sink SHIPS in the STRAIT OF HORMUZ that they control. No oil or gas will be able to leave by SHIPS.
2032 2018-10-21 19:36:48 Trump is too stupid to do anything about climate change and the GOP doesn't care as long as they get their contributions from oil companies. #shameful #ClimateChangeIsReal
2033 2018-10-21 19:36:46 The Saudis’ sometimes ruthless image-making campaign is a byproduct of the kingdom’s increasingly fragile position internationally. For decades, their coffers bursting from the world’s thirst for oil, Saudi leaders cared little about what other countries thought of the kingdom.
2034 2018-10-21 19:36:27 we also can’t develop the land that is held in trust...reservation contain 20% of America’s oil reserve, almost 30%
2035 2018-10-21 19:36:23 Sort of reminds me of my younger brother, his very first car he was completely clueless. Walked out to find him getting ready to dump a quart of oil down dipstick tube for the transmission. He's smart as hell with no common sense.
2036 2018-10-21 19:36:16 Obviously. If you were being paid by big oil and gas as much as they are, you wouldn’t give a crap about the environment we’re leaving for the next generations either. My fear is my vote against them will end up being purely symbolic in our state. WTH. We must try.
2037 2018-10-21 19:36:04 At that weird point in my 20’s where I’m excited that I purchased new oil infusers, underwear and home decor.
2038 2018-10-21 19:36:00 Don’t add any heat
Massage your scalp with Jamaican black castor oil once a week for at least 10min
Don’t cut your hair unless you absolutely need to
Use protein hair mask once a week
And drink plenty of water:)

2044 2018-10-21 19:35:25 They're pretty good but I'm surprised they use peanut oil because of allergies.
2045 2018-10-21 19:35:23 it is great..w coconut oil in place of butter
2046 2018-10-21 19:35:05 Palm oil

2049 2018-10-21 19:34:39 Saw first hand the destruction of pristine rainforests for mass palm oil production. Devastating. Don't buy anything with Palm Oil (knowingly) 
2050 2018-10-21 19:34:27 i used lots of cocoa butter and vitamin e oil! but some people use those and still get them, it just depends on your skin elasticity!
2051 2018-10-21 19:34:21 vape oil. Please I must see
2052 2018-10-21 19:34:19 dont worry, after 5 years we will be in a better position than where we are right now.
US still needs oil hence they wont pull out but they will pressurize Saudis to take power away from MBS.
2053 2018-10-21 19:34:18 My dads cooking is always so damn greasylike he can cook well but for the love of god cut back on some oil and fats
2054 2018-10-21 19:34:17 @Casey_Nilsson  Hi- I saw your article and I wanted to offer my coconut oil that is infused with cannabis. I think it can alleviate some of your issues. I had a severe motorcycle accident @ 16 yrs old. I broke 60 bones and had over 100 surgeries. I amputated my leg 11 years later
2055 2018-10-21 19:34:03 'What a hell of a tradition.' Simon Reeve's reaction to Berber olive oil production methods. Cheers, Simon, I'm sure they really appreciated that. #Mediterranean
2056 2018-10-21 19:34:02 This hair growth oil is amazing l, my hair grew soo much in 2 weeks 
2057 2018-10-21 19:34:02 As soon as we can get to a point where solar and wind power resources are 100% reliable then we will have no choice but to rely on gas and oil for power.

2059 2018-10-21 19:33:54 CBD oil has been working wonders for me. I highly recommend it.  I’ve been taking it for a week now and my energy levels, depression, & anxiety have all approved significantly. 

Check out: @NuLeafNaturals
2060 2018-10-21 19:33:22 Goes to show how disingenuous their whole, "Obama era anti-muslim rant" was. It only mattered because Pres. Obama was a Black man w/a, "weird, Muslim sounding" name (quote from an O'Reilly guest, BTW). Dear Leader says all is well - because of oil and money - they fall in line!
2061 2018-10-21 19:33:04 I have so many Ordinary face solutions like I can solve my deep personal issues through Cold Pressed Rose Hip Oil
2062 2018-10-21 19:32:59 Concept of cost eludes most Nigerians, entrenched by the resource curse having oil put upon Nigeria. Let's not even get into opportunity cost when you have govt resources being used to provide free things, that can otherwise be provided more efficiently/effectively in other ways.
2063 2018-10-21 19:32:54 And yes on religious point of view every religion has extremist element so in Islam. And people like tarek fatah are fighting for it. Most of the terrorist org like isis,brotherhood, Taliban etc. They are the result of international oil reserve politics and USA'S arms insecurity.
2064 2018-10-21 19:32:50 Lol. We can cancel tge arms deal and hurt our industry but Russia will step in. Yemenis will still die. We should be using Canadian oil but progressives blew the chance. Best we can hope for now is to get something we can hold over their head later.
2065 2018-10-21 19:32:37 kailangan kupa pala change oil kotse ni kuya
2066 2018-10-21 19:32:34 I wish to announce I will not play in this year’s Super Bowl unless I get a pony.
2067 2018-10-21 19:32:29 Why haven't we gone to war with the only country who's killed more Americans since the Vietnam war? Iran is not the threat, Saudi Arabia is. Iranian oil is just as good as the Saudi's and the Iranian people are way more trustworthy.
2068 2018-10-21 19:32:21 In fact, going back to your motor oil example, I think that the SAE numbers are a perfect example of giving consumers an easy to understand guide as to what the oil is for. The engineer's can worry about the additives in the oil that get it to those numbers.
2069 2018-10-21 19:32:20 You must be joking .The crises was the result of populist and SOCIALIST polices that began under Chavez Bolivarian Revolution.There economy has collapsed when oil prices plummeted  because that's the only commodity they had.
Venezuela has failed.
2070 2018-10-21 19:32:08 Oil spikes usually lag housing and auto declines leading into recessions so why do u disagree exactly?
2071 2018-10-21 19:32:05 i don’t think coconut oil is supposed to go on your face. it doesn’t break you out or irritate your skin?
2072 2018-10-21 19:31:59 Democrats policies are like using chocolate milk for engine oil, and when the engine fails, blames it on the failures of the engine. The first time I saw that game played, I laughed so hard I fell off my dinosaur!! Well, dinosaur may be an exaggeration - it was my Wholly Mammoth.
2073 2018-10-21 19:31:44 An animal much like Bin Laden . When the country you control produces oil and buys millions in weapons from the US you can do pretty much anything you want.
2074 2018-10-21 19:31:39 Saudi Arabia promised to get the price of oil to 200 per barrel if we place tarriffs or sanctions against them.
2075 2018-10-21 19:31:28 Brent faiyaz and my chai oil >>>
2076 2018-10-21 19:31:28 Ghana Government  must move fast into a good Technology Manufacturing here in Ghana
Its gonna help the incoming youth

And the Merrietime University fees also must cut it down so the the youth will get Access to work into the Oil and Gas Industries.
I Thank You Sir.
2077 2018-10-21 19:31:20 Oh my Gaaaad. Has anyone who used dry shampoo try to oil cleanse their scalp?!  Holy shit i need to do this weekly cuz that was utterly disgusting. I was massaging my scalp and rinsing the oil out and my nails were catching so much nasty.  Yikesmaaaan.
2078 2018-10-21 19:31:15 Blak oil FTW
2079 2018-10-21 19:31:12 Exactly. My dad was a geologist, but chose YYC over anywhere else in the world with Oil Fields because he loved hiking and the outdoors. Albertans are better steward of the environment than any other oil producing nation globally, and always have been.
2080 2018-10-21 19:31:07 #Mediterranean I'll pass on the olive oil thanks
2081 2018-10-21 19:30:59 Please, leave tomatoes & olives away from the real Spanish omelette.
Eggs, potatoes, onion, salt and olive oil. Some chorizo... Why not?
But adding anything else... call it PIZZA instead. 
2082 2018-10-21 19:30:56 CASTEN says wind, sun, cells and the sea
Are good, clean sources of cheap energy. 
But Roskam with Trump says coal and oil are the best.
IL 6th should give Peter a rest!

Flip the IL 6th District! 
Vote SEAN CASTEN!
2083 2018-10-21 19:30:50 Recall that the Saudis have been lying about their oil reserves for years. There is evidence that their largest oil field now pumps brackish water #peakoil
2084 2018-10-21 19:30:47 It all comes down to one simple equation:  m + o = gpp .  Money + Oil = Geopolitical Power.
2085 2018-10-21 19:30:37 Spanish omelette? If you remove the tomatos, the olives, the chorizo and balance the proportion of eggs/potatoes maybe you can get close to a spanish omelette. Did you use olive oil?
2086 2018-10-21 19:30:29 GCC oil fields are critically important global economic assets & Mecca a profoundly important historical place - both of which must be tightly protected, I surmise.

As well, a muscular counterbalance to Shia Iran is necessary to maintain stability in the region.

In a nutshell.

2089 2018-10-21 19:30:18 Thats what I said It is to be seen if US and others turn towards Russia for oil... I feel chances are they wont.
2090 2018-10-21 19:30:15 Its oil sweat lol
2091 2018-10-21 19:30:15 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. Yet they are starving due to their socialism. BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
2092 2018-10-21 19:30:09 Go away. Just stop. Basra is right. No ones buying the snake oil dude.
2093 2018-10-21 19:30:09 Nadia and I set out to get water and three hours later we’re sitting in a graveyard with no water, a new essential oil, and a coupon
2094 2018-10-21 19:30:04 The battery attached to the plates on the top and bottom of the chamber allowed me to apply an electric voltage. The electric field produced in the chamber as a result of the voltage would act on the charged oil drops.
2095 2018-10-21 19:29:57 Yes like that BG article pointed out, Douglas fir harvested 40-45 cycles but best left to grow 80 years. Are we that patient? Renewable materials, like renewable energy, not always available ‘on demand’ like we’ve come to expect from everything since oil changed our world
2096 2018-10-21 19:29:48 Once the Whole #Saudi #EVIL is put to death, we would control the #OIL reserve of the Arabian shield and use it for the better good of humanity and better balance the #Iran situation #Trump #TrumpIsWeak #SaudiArabiaIsEvil But Trump wont do it because he's #weak
2097 2018-10-21 19:29:47 If we (say half of us) use alternative fuels (electric vehicle, fuel cell etc) instead of oil, wouldn't we have whole different conversation regarding what's going on around world?

I will reconsider my next energy consumption.
2098 2018-10-21 19:29:36 Yes...Makes your hair all soft...Plus coconut oil...Such is heaven
2099 2018-10-21 19:29:35 Combine this with Canada stopping the annual purchase of over $2 billion worth of Saudi oil. Then we can make a statement, and relieve the influence that Saudi think they have over the rest of the world.
2100 2018-10-21 19:29:17 Los socialistas ,esos que luchaban por los pobres , eliminarán el Gas_Oil ,y a los pobres que no pueden comprar coches nuevos que les den por culo vota PSOE ,y vive la miseria
2101 2018-10-21 19:29:07 Great article!
My opinion is that one of the reasons to the current failure of the Saudis foreign policy is the fact that since the ״oil boom״ in the golf states they use to sponsors “friends” to make the the dirty work, without any boots on the ground
2102 2018-10-21 19:29:05 Yes. and Rosemary oil.
2103 2018-10-21 19:29:02 (१)पेट्रोल के दाम international मार्केट के हिसाब से बड़ते या घटते हैं। ऐसा कोई अनोखा भारत में नहीं होता, बल्कि सारी दुनिया में होता है।यहाँ तक कि oil producing देशों में भी दाम बड़ते हैं।भारत तेल दूसरे देशों से ख़रीदकर अपनी मार्केट मे बेचता है
2104 2018-10-21 19:29:00 Do tree felling workers rights trump oil industry workers rights? Or is it just people YOU have signed a contract with whose rights overrule protestors rights? Your duplicity gets deeper the more you dig.

2106 2018-10-21 19:28:24 The Saudis have bad script writers as well. Oil can't solve everything
2107 2018-10-21 19:28:12 Gold > oil
Its a gold rush really.  Oil is a talking point.
2108 2018-10-21 19:28:11 Do you know why Trump said KSA can’t survive for two days if we pull out? Because The Saudis tried to tell them there’s a new player in the oil game. Russia.
2109 2018-10-21 19:28:09 In 1979 the Saudis imposed an oil embargo on the US. Jimmy Carter created fuel efficiency standards and started giving tax cuts for renewable resources. The Saudis folded and dropped the embargo. 
Too bad we don't have a President like Jimmy Carter.
2110 2018-10-21 19:27:24 What about ppl who accidentally spill peppermint oil
2111 2018-10-21 19:27:17 :( , politics aside, this is horrible news taking a competitive commercial management and replacing it with oil money is not the best idea for a club with this history.  Turki Alshike is ur new board member. that's bad just bad
2112 2018-10-21 19:27:17 Destroying Ploesti oil refineries might be what she has in mind
2113 2018-10-21 19:27:16 Your oil field business is going to continue to suffer until Alberta oil has a direct route to the world market. Trudeau isn’t your enemy, John Horgan and his bromance with Weaver is.
2114 2018-10-21 19:27:14 Dont let fear of driving drunk and those  messages about harsh penalties keep you from doing it? 
For anyone LEGALLY able to vote, and following the rules, why would they have any fear? Absurd
2115 2018-10-21 19:27:10 Also Parma got back to my written question in 2 weeks. Still waiting close to 7 months for @Megan_Woods to reply to my correspondence. Too busy jetting around the world while banning oil #hypocrisy

2117 2018-10-21 19:27:02 @KatRamsland What little oil I do need I get from Halliburton.
2118 2018-10-21 19:26:54 Russia, China, Iran, Syria killed how many journalist this year? How many of their people too. Was it a stupid move? Yes. it was. The oil they provide to the West is crucial. We can hold them accountable w/o driving them into the hands of our foes & destabilizing the region more.
2119 2018-10-21 19:26:42 But not to worry Saudis we won’t ban your oil or the weapons we are selling to you
2120 2018-10-21 19:26:32 1930. Oil paint, rusted steel, laminate, enamelled tin butterfly, paper, cork, and china, mounted on board

2123 2018-10-21 19:26:15 Next, I applied a charge to the oil drops by filling the chamber with x-rays. This caused the air to become ionized making the electrons attach themselves to the oil drops.
2124 2018-10-21 19:26:10 @KatRamsland I stop buying your oil and put my economy on TESLA Batteries.
2125 2018-10-21 19:25:57 Yet, the media is fair & balanced. One if my greatest wishes is for the US to develop a fuel source so  we could tell those camel riding SOB's to drink that oil.
All the oil in the mid east is not worth one drop of American blood.
2126 2018-10-21 19:25:57 Not to mention I have to book an oil change a month in advance
2127 2018-10-21 19:25:56 the oil death ft dan howell
2128 2018-10-21 19:25:55 Remember that KSA (in a weird way) has more leverage over our monetary policy than it does over our access to energy (esp now with fracking). 

This is because oil priced in dollars re: third party markets creates global demand for dollar.
2129 2018-10-21 19:25:54 Don't get me started on them! We've had them forget to put the filler cap back on twice, not put enough oil in, etc. 

I was busy the last time my oil needed to be changed so Mrs. Tom took it to Jiffy Lube, I had to kick the wrench to remove the drain plug today.
2130 2018-10-21 19:25:52 The oil room has been trolling dan for his entire life
2131 2018-10-21 19:25:45 I understand the oil industry was all that was nationalized. My point was mostly people obfuscate the truth because they don’t actually have an argument. Either due to purposeful ignorance or a complete lack of understanding
2132 2018-10-21 19:25:42 Oil stocks will crash in this weekend. Not exactly.　　石油株は今週末に暴落するだろう。いや、そうでもないよ。
2133 2018-10-21 19:25:27 The private sector always remained, and capitalists within and abroad were free to undermine the economy and export massive amount of capital out of the country. And when you tie everything to the oil, you're fucked when the price drops too much, which it did.
2134 2018-10-21 19:25:26 dan haunted by the oil room
2135 2018-10-21 19:25:22 Strip mined lithium. There's no single solution to the transportation issue. It would help if oil prices got much higher - forcing manufacturers to put money into R&D, and consumers to look for alternatives.
2136 2018-10-21 19:25:12 where can i get oil blends from?
2137 2018-10-21 19:25:06 Lynne coulda always used a VO5 hot oil treatment.
2138 2018-10-21 19:24:58 The lives of people currently do not matter to him or the GOP for that matter. Saudi Arabia Egypt Trump & Israel want complete control of the Arabian Gulf, The oil on those 2 untapped Islands the water source since water is a vital resource there too. Meanwhile Gaza is not yet
2139 2018-10-21 19:24:58 @KatRamsland Yeah because I don't need your oil.  I got Lithium ION Batteries.
2140 2018-10-21 19:24:40 2)Forget Trump,US has been in bed w/them due to billions in arms deals&oil. If u want to talk individs,Clinton’s heavily profited as well.
2141 2018-10-21 19:24:30 Listen to the entire Coconut Oil album. Once per week at least.
2142 2018-10-21 19:24:21 You live in a fantasy if you think we can keep using oil b/c if we do there won't be a modern world to enjoy. I get your bias and reluctance to seek other ways, you are an Albertan who has been spoon fed since birth this rhetoric. But your resistance does not help, only hinders.
2143 2018-10-21 19:24:13 They want access to the Oil that is in the region! That is why Donnie is assisting them in their genocide against the Yemeni People. it is all about the money!
2144 2018-10-21 19:24:07 Almond Oil
2145 2018-10-21 19:23:39 ?

Burn coal and bunker oil and storm Normandy Beach?
2146 2018-10-21 19:23:37 So much oil the U.S. Army will invade the garage area.
2147 2018-10-21 19:23:34 It's not even communist. All during Chavez' reign, about 70% of Venezuela's gross domestic product was created by the private sector. Chavez, though his intentions were noble, tied virtually all his economic reforms to the oil sector, which he nationalized.
2148 2018-10-21 19:23:28 You still trust polls ? US election proved them unreliable. I suspect leave would win again, but saying the media & politicians are  elitist & don't accept the result... reallt ? Some media helped oil the wheels that brought the result along with v wealthy politicians.
2149 2018-10-21 19:23:02 I know of

2150 2018-10-21 19:23:00 Make sure your CBD oil is from the marijuana strain of the plant. Not the hemp version. Hemp version is snake  oil. Just sayin.
2151 2018-10-21 19:22:58 Christies was the best place to work - loved the staff and the patients, I’d recommend it in a heartbeat. 

Parboil, jumble ‘em up in a tea towel (Delia’s tip) and use hot fat - olive oil makes them very crispy. I take almost as much pride in them as in my lateral knees...
2152 2018-10-21 19:22:53 The oil & gas industry backed Todd Lamb...so...
2153 2018-10-21 19:22:49 Haven't heard that they were almost out of oil, but I do know that Russia would like better relations with them. They're our only Arab "ally" in the region, and conflict with them will definitely push gas prices up. This issue is far more complex than the headlines we're seeing.
2154 2018-10-21 19:22:35 Trump is friends with the republican politicians = his fellow con men that con the voter into thinking they work for the people and not the big oil big pharma etc and themselves. Trump have "friends" there corrupt politicians and other 1 percenters.

Ryan Blaney won the race off pit road and will take the lead
2156 2018-10-21 19:22:32 I could honestly cry. An old man who was a regular customer at our store was buying crazy amounts of oil. We contacted his son, turns out he was frying his food in motor oil because of dementia. He’s in the hospital getting his system flushed but they don’t know if he’ll make it.
2157 2018-10-21 19:22:29 mmmn pakashata...man of the match achiphwa cooking oil
2158 2018-10-21 19:22:22 @realDonaldTrump  do not bow to the oil from the east. This is the thread.... pull it.... do it... that’s why you’re here. That’s why we voted. She’s still free so at least free us from the saudis. From the Great War to Benghazi. We’re f omg done.
2159 2018-10-21 19:22:10 Right, and oil more so than silver.
2160 2018-10-21 19:22:03 @naval @ONECodeBase thinking of the conundrum of how to influence the culture of a wealthy but corporate oil city that needs to change economic model. How to make angel syndicates popular in a community? Suggestions anyone? #Entrepreneurship #angelinvesting #Northsea #change
2161 2018-10-21 19:22:00 Plus companies could be smart and profit on the new energy thingy instead of rely on oil.
2162 2018-10-21 19:21:57 Soggy bottom = oil not hot enough
2163 2018-10-21 19:21:50 Just close America for all ppl and things coming by air, rail, road and water, no in and no out, no international trade, no oil and gas in or out. That’ll fix America. 
2164 2018-10-21 19:21:37 I don’t think I like hitting my oil pen like that bc that cough is something different  I can’t take that shit
2165 2018-10-21 19:21:32 I will,but does deep economics matter much to me a ghetto boy who just want food on the table..queuing for cooking oil reminds me of that year...is it part of the long term plan?
2166 2018-10-21 19:21:29 How about letting the oil marketing companies set the price of petrol so they can maximize their profit margin? Same with natural gas and electricity. Let them milk the consumer as much as they want. Wake up! It's not always black and white.

2170 2018-10-21 19:21:23 I’ve seen them,just after war ended,everyone was some mothers son,fathers son,and you keep banging on..one day ,you might have oil,one day,you might be a rich little place,and then you will be an offshore Brunei,and will dump us in uk,selling oil to highest bidder.even Argentina.
2171 2018-10-21 19:21:17 @NASCARonNBC  caution after Wm. Byron blows engine (not a common thing in modern-day NASCAR) Long caution as they clean oil off pit road. Still in Stage 1.
2172 2018-10-21 19:21:14 Freshest unction and oil at work 
2173 2018-10-21 19:20:53 Sure. I can address the flaws. You sholda told me before!

Sacrificing a buncha stuff that needs oil.
Costs to make everything compatible with this new replacement for oil.
Companies go "shwooooooooooooo.. KABOOM" (bankruptcy).

but a solution to all these is taking our time.
2174 2018-10-21 19:20:39 Can East Asia and the Beast Oil on canvas 48 in x 48….
2175 2018-10-21 19:20:29 For years we've gone on about citeh having a sugar daddy to pull em out if the shit and we've made our own money...all of a sudden an oil rich family come sniffing and we're like 'hellll yeah' buy us up!! ..no ta.. keep your dosh...were cool......imo
2176 2018-10-21 19:20:26 does castor oil really work for hair growth?
2177 2018-10-21 19:20:17 I think the funniest thing being from a non-academic family/city is the amount of dismay when I explain that I’m a geophysicist that does not study earthquakes or oil.
2178 2018-10-21 19:20:15 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.

2180 2018-10-21 19:20:03 Chicken fingers with a twist. Coat chicken fingers with flour, egg, milk, salt and potato chips. Fry in canola oil
2181 2018-10-21 19:19:43 We are federally licensed in Colombia.  Does that count?  We can sell oil by the tonne to licensed importers.
2182 2018-10-21 19:19:25 Self care Sunday includes going to Target under the guise of getting Olive Oil
2183 2018-10-21 19:19:12 Getting Canadian oil to market and cutting them off is the only punishment they understand.
2184 2018-10-21 19:19:07 같은 동네 사나봄
2185 2018-10-21 19:19:00 I Need Sum More Oil Burners.
2186 2018-10-21 19:18:59 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。
2187 2018-10-21 19:18:47 It is yet to be seen if investors boycott one of the biggest oil exporters  you really think US or europe will do that? I dont think so - Yes, investors like US will try capitalising on this JK murder but they wont boycott it.Has the world boycotted India over atrocities in K?
2188 2018-10-21 19:18:18 Turkey pepperoni r awesome! Transitioning to turkey bacon is a lil harder lol. I fry mine in a lil olive oil so that it’s crispy but it’s still not BACON bacon
2189 2018-10-21 19:18:15 Right now our main concern is inflation and getting our normal lives back. Kombi, bread, cooking oil prices must come down. Izvo zve party yenyu long hair dnt care. Eyes on the ball every patrotic zimbabwean. We need our country working
2190 2018-10-21 19:18:13 New wood cutting board maintenance tips*: 1) Be sure to clean it thoroughly before the first use. 2) Condition it with vegetable oil afterward to prevent the wood from drying and cracking. If you do that, your wood cutting board should last you for years.
2191 2018-10-21 19:18:08 They are the very same people yelling that we should punish Saudi Arabia and who don’t realize our oil is the best weapon to use.
2192 2018-10-21 19:18:07 Not hungry enough for a full meal?? Go for a piadina like this! Prosciutto crudo, radicchio salad, Parmesan and good olive oil... what to drink with?? A Pinot Noir 2015 from my friend Enrico Cordini!! Enjoy!! @ Taverna Malanotte
2193 2018-10-21 19:18:05 Margherita, I love mushroom soup with a little truffle oil,  particularly the giant puffball ones. They are delicious - so are you!  Used to love hearing you on Capital FM a few years ago, but seeing you is better! And your presentation style is infectious!
2194 2018-10-21 19:17:47 The way I'm going down in the @fplofficial league, i will soon discover crude oil. 
2195 2018-10-21 19:17:47 @GoringHardware do you have chainsaw oil ?
2196 2018-10-21 19:17:39 Pit road has been covered in oil layed down by @WilliamByron. Teams and #NASCAR cleaning up the mess.

#NASCARPlayoffs | #HC400
2197 2018-10-21 19:17:36 She signed an agreement with Russia to buy 60% of their gas and oil from them.  This counters the US sanctions that have been put on.  They are in bed with the people that meddled in our election.
2198 2018-10-21 19:17:33 Byron dropped oil in front of @keselowski's pit stall. You know what, racing gods? You're really starting to piss me off.
2199 2018-10-21 19:17:19 Things will be better after my son starts working. He will have to buy heating oil for November. 
2200 2018-10-21 19:17:17 S/O to my mommy for buying my castor oil shampoo and conditioner.
2201 2018-10-21 19:17:14 I'm happy for governments to boycott SA. The faster we stop pouring in billions for their oil, the better.
2202 2018-10-21 19:16:43 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
2203 2018-10-21 19:16:36 has anybody used castor oil for their hair? does it work good?
2204 2018-10-21 19:16:34 I suspect it has always been like this. Big money big consultancies big oil big four big countries big politicians big defence contracts and little offshore money laundering centres laundering bigwig money for the same little group of global filthy rich big heads!
2205 2018-10-21 19:16:34 If the oil and gas `s top management  not change their mind is impossible to be successful using digital transformation
2206 2018-10-21 19:16:32 Some things i would like right now:

2208 2018-10-21 19:16:16 There is oil at the entrance to pit road where Byron came through. Erik Jones' crew was trying to scrub it so it wouldn't cause issues during the stop. #NASCAR
2209 2018-10-21 19:16:12 The Big Cup O' Olive oil, now with Mustard
2210 2018-10-21 19:16:12 The sad fact is that you think having an ACA hating, “no new taxes” living republican in office will change that. I agree democrats have not done enough to help WV, but you don’t burn the house down by inviting a snake oil salesman in to run things.
2211 2018-10-21 19:16:05 If someone blows an engine they should be required to stop and get put on the flatbed instead of dropping oil everywhere on the way to the garage.
2212 2018-10-21 19:16:04 Rough day for @WilliamByron. He brings out the first caution as his engine expires and spreads oil all on the track with 28 laps left in Stage One
2213 2018-10-21 19:15:55 Well, no. It was noticed when they wanted papa bush to sic Saddam in 91. Oil money goes deep. Trump is merely the lowest, most craven example in a long line of subservience.
2214 2018-10-21 19:15:49 그 약 6시간 후에 복용하는 건데 ㅠ 연달아 먹엇다고 팀원아
2215 2018-10-21 19:15:47 Me: I just got burned by the oil
Coworker: Welcome to kitchen, now get another (chicken) drop
2216 2018-10-21 19:15:36 Yes.
I also pay for supplies to clean and oil them (prevents rust).
Under this gun club proposal, I would still be storing, cleaning, and oiling guns, because only the AR-15s (and similar) would be at the gun club.
It's creating new costs and new liabilities.
2217 2018-10-21 19:15:26 .@WilliamByron drove into the garage on lap 57. Oil is on pit road, affecting some teams' stalls like @erik_jones and @keselowski. #NASCARPlayoffs #HC400
2218 2018-10-21 19:15:26 Oil is pit road in front of @keselowski pit and 2 others
2219 2018-10-21 19:15:22 팀원아 디질거 같이 아프니? 난 두통 오져서 약 두개 머거써 ㅠㅠ
2220 2018-10-21 19:15:20 Lap 58: This is potentially going to be a lengthy cleanup as William Byron's No. 24 left a lot of oil/fluid on the track and even in some pit boxes. #HollywoodCasino400
2221 2018-10-21 19:15:20 The US, Saudi Arabia, and Iran arguing over crude oil trade are indirectly affecting petrolium, plastic manufacturing, and eletricity prices.

If you don't want to pay for the higher/fluctuating prices, please don't feed the oil industry your money and go green.
2222 2018-10-21 19:15:19 They got their name from the oil rig, though, so it wouldn't make sense for people on the East coast to call themselves "the Enclave" before any personnel moved to the oil rig.
2223 2018-10-21 19:15:04 Shea butter leave-in, bitch!
Gun oil, something...
2224 2018-10-21 19:15:04 Searching for a bad play, I take off my clothes and see an oil rig melt on the moon
2225 2018-10-21 19:15:02 I’m just arguing that like Sean is saying, climate is an issue everyone can get behind. It should be a bipartisan issue. It has been in the past, until big oil lobbying bought out the GOP. Stop pointing fingers at pro life dems and start pointing them at your own party.
2226 2018-10-21 19:15:01 Oil in front of the 2’s pit stall will make the upcoming pit stop interesting
2227 2018-10-21 19:14:53 Oil change 
2228 2018-10-21 19:14:49 왜 다른 팀원 다 자는데 내가 디질거 같아서 중단 하면 내가 손해보지
2229 2018-10-21 19:14:47 Obama left Trump a brand new car (economy), and all Trump has done is change the oil and put gas in it.
2230 2018-10-21 19:14:40 Yes, agreed. Can you have a chat with your colleague @Megan_Woods about those oil permits...?
2231 2018-10-21 19:14:39 Obama left Trump a brand new car (economy), and all Trump has done is change the oil and put gas in it.
2232 2018-10-21 19:14:38 Interfering with Saudi affairs could result in losing our military airfields in their country, have them cut oil production so we pay $20 gallon for gas, and support Iran and North Korai off embargo, become a Russian allied. Dumb move. Is this the only association in the world?
2233 2018-10-21 19:14:36 Yu never had sex sex if you ain't never fucked up ya sheets because you put baby oil all over a girl ass 
2234 2018-10-21 19:14:30 agree caring!! they say "sustainable" huh, what? sustainable cash cow for your oil slick flow? no thank you. petrol is so two centuries ago.
2235 2018-10-21 19:14:14 Going to be a lengthy cleanup. Radio says the 24 left an oil streak “a mile long down pit road” which seems impossible because pit road isn’t a mile long?
2236 2018-10-21 19:14:13 Oil
Brent crude rose by US49 cents or 0.6% to US$79.78 a barrel and the US Nymex price rose by US47 cents or 0.7% to US$69.12 a barrel. Over the week Brent fell by US65 cents or 0.8% and Nymex fell by US$2.22 or 3.1%.  
#ausbiz #markets #oil #aufindaily
2237 2018-10-21 19:14:10 Want to know a secret?  US exports of oil will soon eclipse Saudi.  The entire reason they are trying to “reform” is because they’re nearly out of oil and will have literally nothing else.  You don’t need to fear them!
2238 2018-10-21 19:14:10 Vote like your planet depends on it. We can’t let the GOP #PlanetKILLERS take humanity down the drain all for their donors’ extra profits. Think of this stage of humanity as being a raging alcoholic with oil as the intoxicant.
2239 2018-10-21 19:13:58 Fix the economy one cooking oil bottle at a time.
2240 2018-10-21 19:13:56 Lots of oil on pit road here at @kansasspeedway from the No. 24 of @WilliamByron 

Expect this caution to last a while before they can even open pit road
2241 2018-10-21 19:13:54 My weed pen  broke my mom was trynna help me suck up the oil w. A needle and all

2243 2018-10-21 19:13:47 But the sentiment is true, it’s climate and oil reserves means it could be super wealthy.
2244 2018-10-21 19:13:37 Oil price could 
2245 2018-10-21 19:13:17 Would expect a lengthly cleanup with all the oil and fluid that came from the 24 of William Byron. Joey Logano still the race leader #NASCAR
2246 2018-10-21 19:12:57 @RoseDeBerne 
Mea culpa. J'ai cherché en vain dans des épiceries asiatiques de la "peanut oil", huile très rare sans doute jusqu'à ce que je réalise qu'il s'agissait d'huile d'arachide...

2248 2018-10-21 19:12:39 Pits are closed so the oil can be cleaned up off pit road.
2249 2018-10-21 19:12:38 Need to clean pit road of oil before opening pits.
2250 2018-10-21 19:12:34 A meal in 60 seconds! Chicken thigh baked with bacon mince and olive oil.
2251 2018-10-21 19:12:32 Hairy moment for @WilliamByron, nearly sliding in his own oil at the garage entrance.
2252 2018-10-21 19:12:30 Byron lost an engine and a quite a bit of oil it appears.
2253 2018-10-21 19:12:26 Waiting for my MCT oil so I can officially start keto but I’ve been playing w coffee flavorings since I can’t have my usual creamer && I think I just found my new go to

2257 2018-10-21 19:12:03 Steaming, (olbas oil in water if you can bear it). Gargling with salt water, and more steaming...feel better soon x
2258 2018-10-21 19:11:59 To clarify, I do like the tray frames they made for Tania Rutland's oil paintings. I'm looking for something specific for works on paper though.
2259 2018-10-21 19:11:52 Ew I hate oil and rubbing it on people
2260 2018-10-21 19:11:45 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails
2261 2018-10-21 19:11:44 OK, oil prices.
2262 2018-10-21 19:11:39 2 ships passing...in the night...polluting oil tankers spewing
2263 2018-10-21 19:11:37 Let’s go Oil Kings!
2264 2018-10-21 19:11:33 Superfood oil, cleansing balm oxygenating night cream
2265 2018-10-21 19:11:26 내 몸은 왜 누워있는가..?
2266 2018-10-21 19:11:22 That’s a great incentive to get better- you certainly don’t want to be ill on the flight! 
May I suggest a Boots stop for essentials: Olbas oil/Vicks inhaler, Strepsils/Lockets, tissues, hand sanitiser, etc..
2267 2018-10-21 19:11:20 Where were we? Oh. So I sprayed oil and allowed it to settle into a hole so it would fall into a chamber where I could study the charge of it. The top and bottom of the chamber were electrically charged plates.
2268 2018-10-21 19:11:15 저 종이는 왜 두장인가?
2269 2018-10-21 19:11:10 Try frying egg with palm oil 
2270 2018-10-21 19:10:58 We don't have oil

2272 2018-10-21 19:10:34 gas and oil culture is actually fuelled by little dick energy

2274 2018-10-21 19:10:23 We also import Crude oil but I believe your Kenyan politicians are on another level of Greed, compared to our Corrupt bunch in South Africa
2275 2018-10-21 19:10:20 CYOC (Cook your own Cannabis) Ghee and Olive Oil is 25% off all day! It's a tasty and easy way to incorporate cannabis in your cooking!
2276 2018-10-21 19:10:18 I think sanctions and a dialing back of how much oil we buy from them is an appropriate response. I’m not calling for regime change like Rand Paul, tho that’s fine too, but we have to show them we’re not so reliant on them that we’ll let them get away w/ stuff others couldn’t.

2278 2018-10-21 19:10:06 Point 2- Next OIL REFINERIES. These use Abserloutely staggering amounts of power, as much as a small town just to convert from into petrol. Far more than is needed to make batteries etc needed for EVs.
2279 2018-10-21 19:10:04 プールとか入るとよくわからないけど凄まじい勢いで浮くよ。
2280 2018-10-21 19:09:54 Point 1 - Firstly you have to transport oil both to refineries and then petrol goes in huge deisel trucks have to carry it daily to forecourts. Electrical power goes direct almost instantly from where it is made and into car.
2281 2018-10-21 19:09:47 Amazing. I guess we are dating ourselves. So people that have no clue about hot knifing "hash oil" - extract. You heat up ends of 2 knives (no need to be red hot so you don't need gloves) and you hold them under your nose. A friend uses an eye dropper and places a drop of oil...
2282 2018-10-21 19:09:47 Khuda ke liye door mein oil daal lo ya change karwa lo.
2283 2018-10-21 19:09:42 Was Luck not ready? That snap was high, but I didn’t think crazily high.

Ryan Kelly/Luck have had some snap issues near that end zone this season.

Well, it’s 24-5 now at Lucas Oil Stadium.
2284 2018-10-21 19:09:40 Their oil & money is
2285 2018-10-21 19:09:40 @VP is this what the Iranian regime's opponents wanted, boycott Iran's oil and then exempt it, is really ridiculous. These filthy, ruthless, anti-Semitic, anti-humanized Israelis, murderers who feed the blood of the people of the Middle East
2286 2018-10-21 19:09:30 Disappeared down a zero waste Pinterest rabbit hole tonight. Why on earth does everything contain coconut oil?
2287 2018-10-21 19:09:23 I hate waiting forever in line for an oil change at valvoline I don't understand why it's always so slow. I even packed a lunch for this wait (yoccos) and I haven't even moved up one car yet
2288 2018-10-21 19:09:18 It’s all about the money! In this case I The form of oil!  Pure greed!!   Go solar, go wind, go hydro.... then we won’t need oil and have to deal with such cruel people.
2289 2018-10-21 19:09:04 Watching the Western backlash against Saudi Arabia as anything other than political propaganda is delusional. This regime is also causing one of the worlds worst famine of modern history, if the west wasn’t so oil addicted they could use this as the catalyst for shifting the
2290 2018-10-21 19:08:56 I’m not much for hyperbole Bill, but I would define evil as relentlessly pushing a war agenda for decades on behalf of the oil industry that culminated in 2 illegal occupations that killed millions of innocent Iraqis
2291 2018-10-21 19:08:47 We were the world's biggest exporter before & after WW2. We need oil drills but the Gulf States can basically scoop it up with a bucket. High quality crude oil. Big Oil was & still is very big. Huge profits.
The West and Asia have the technology to built a fossil fuel free world
2292 2018-10-21 19:08:47 Lmaooooo guy 90 odds entered for me with 100. Very random and stupid selections. Used the money to fill my gas and change oil in my car. Imagine if I come use 100k
2293 2018-10-21 19:08:41 @VP Everybody saw that they said until November 4 that Iran's oil exports were zero, how many times it was repeated, whether we were to blame or they were. It does not really hurt and this government has proved that it is a mercenary of dirty Israeli and Jewish politicians
2294 2018-10-21 19:08:25 Hairdressers told me ages ago to start putting coconut oil in my hair , I done it last night and I can’t get it out 
2295 2018-10-21 19:08:24 Eww! You're supposed to roast them in olive oil!
2296 2018-10-21 19:08:22 THIS IS WHERE THEIR PROBLEMS STARTED WITH PMB!

Oil license not renewable… President Buhari
2297 2018-10-21 19:08:09 Since bread is going to be four dollars and I can't find sugar, coke, oil or mazoe.. I may as well start my diet now.
2298 2018-10-21 19:08:09 There is more money to be made in oil and coal - ask Trump.
2299 2018-10-21 19:08:02 I just added tea tree oil and tumeric to my Indian healing clay mask, let’s see how this works !

2302 2018-10-21 19:07:24 Tried briefly, found it really frustrating! Not so bad with chocolate mousse/truffles, which have a bit of cream/oil and play nice with nigori/koshu, but very difficult with bars... Will it run again? Only seen one other sake/choc pairing before (big importer in Switzerland).
2303 2018-10-21 19:07:24 Oh, we have oil wealth?! Why have I never heard of it? And gas, too?
2304 2018-10-21 19:07:11 Stop buying Oil, this problem will slowly go away.
2305 2018-10-21 19:07:04 Hope oil

They even mistakenly pay their staff Rs 4 Billion per month instead of Rs 40,000 
2311 2018-10-21 19:06:53 But you're always reminded the oil one works right

2316 2018-10-21 19:06:06 Wait, quick break. What color tux should I wear to my friend/student Harvey Fletcher's wedding? Also, did I mention that Harvey helped me with my oil drop experiment? It was actually his idea to replace water with oil but I didn't give him credit because I'm #petty.
2317 2018-10-21 19:05:51 Idk who needs to hear this, but check the oil in your car
2318 2018-10-21 19:05:45 No way to get Canadian oil to the consumer
2319 2018-10-21 19:05:34 These folks failed to record hillary started fires in Tunisia, Libya, BIG INFERNO IN EGYPT, POURED MOTOR OIL on the Gaza Strip Cauldron, Triggered Syria, made events ripe post pullout in Iraq, ENABLED Aggressive Occupations by Putin (HRC is the 4) of the Apocalypse

2321 2018-10-21 19:05:24 P.S. 100% of your Uranium comes from Canada and most of your oil. Wouldn't you want to buddy up with such an ally whom without your country can not maintain a nuclear arsenal. But Iran I'm sure will happily provide oil and Uranium to you not the Suad's.
2322 2018-10-21 19:05:21 Finally! A comment that mentions oil. This is the only comment I have seen that mentions fossil fuels and the fact that Saudis are the oil control knobs. If they decrease production, the US economy is totally screwed, and therefore will do whatever the Saudis demand.
2323 2018-10-21 19:05:20 Ah, found the probable cause to my brain fog yesterday, but it was already too late and in my smoothie. Black mold on the jar lid of pomegranate peel extract. Will begin freezing my next batch. Going to take extra Syrian rue and Nigella sativa oil after this smoothie though

2327 2018-10-21 19:05:09 I watched the news where some in your state felt the state should run the National Park lands.  What I heard was "we want US taxpayers to give us $$$$ and not have input". 
Secede.  
Montana can get its dollars from the oil companies who would install rigs and fracking on NPs.
2328 2018-10-21 19:05:05 There's my pudgy mug and then there's Pava looking like he's straight out of some Renaissance oil painting

2337 2018-10-21 19:04:14 I'm not sure what "the general public" has to do with the conversation?  The byte unit (and the associate prefixes) should be defined by the experts in the field.  The general public should understand bytes like they understand SAE Viscosity grades for motor oil.

2348 2018-10-21 19:03:11 The difference between good and evil is that good doesn't cause suffering. Evil is synonymous to causing suffering. Non-immediate suffering is an evil that is easy to get away with. This kind of evil is often highly profitable. Oil companies are examples of this kind of evil.

2357 2018-10-21 19:02:04 I didn't find out much but I remember when I a similar issue it was recommended to use the oil base instead of the water based. You can do latex over oil but not the other way around. Maybe get a small can and sand off the gloss and give it a try.

2359 2018-10-21 19:01:36 I wonder what the strategic consequences would be of (1) losing military bases in Saudi, UAE and Saudi allies (2) the Saudis/UAE using oil wealth and bully pulpits to sponsor anti-American groups and ideologies (3) the Saudis turning to the Russians for protection and weapons.

2377 2018-10-21 19:00:16 Saudi Arabia trying to use oil prices as a weapon is a non-starter. This is not 1973 and OPEC is far from a  fully functioning cartel. The US can be a swing producer with shale oil. Pushing oil prices up will also make the Chinese, Indians and others angry and anxious.
2378 2018-10-21 18:59:58 Actually that is not even true at all. The US -does- need their oil and it -does- need their land as a military strategic base in the middle east.

2406 2018-10-21 18:56:55 This killing of a journalist was horrific.  My 1st thoughts were we need to "build a wall to protect us from these brutal uncivilized royals".  Now I just feel we need to get off the need for Saudi oil and look closer to whom we sell arms.
2407 2018-10-21 18:56:49 THANK YOU! 

Forget Global Warming — there are many other great reasons to GET OFF OIL! 

Want to reduce/ eliminate the importance/ power/ wealth of Arab states & Russia?

Want to reduce the US Military budget?

Want to become truly energy independent and secure? 

GET OFF OIL!
2408 2018-10-21 18:56:43 If Iran was allowed to supply oil it will bring back balance.
2409 2018-10-21 18:56:28 I want to know where they got all those very new looking backpacks?
2410 2018-10-21 18:56:27 Nice oil story. So I should sell it.
2411 2018-10-21 18:56:19 I remember one fight that happened in Malali, Elrufai came and shared rice and oil to the victim's family  and fight continued.
2412 2018-10-21 18:56:16 The first day of my annual leave didn't go too well...I've cut my finger whilst sorting the recycling...and burnt my finger in hot oil while cooking one of my favourite meals!!! I'm jinxed today!! 
2413 2018-10-21 18:56:01 Really tho if you’re one of those people who doesn’t get regular oil changes, spring for the full synthetic. Protect your motor a little at least. If you think 50-60 bucks for an oil change is expensive, wait until that motor seizes.
2414 2018-10-21 18:55:54  poor little nugget. A spoon of olive oil helps.

2417 2018-10-21 18:55:10 No amount of Saudi oil money can buy back the dignity lost by the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Nor could it bring back this dedicated journalist who wanted a better Saudi Arabia. MBS is culpable. This happened under his rule. Halt the arms sales. Hold MBS responsible.
2418 2018-10-21 18:55:08 You couldn't find the oil emoji either?
2419 2018-10-21 18:55:06 Maybe we could nationalise oil once independent?? Just a thought. Would that help the balance sheet? Genuine question. I don't claim to be an economics genius. Btw.

2423 2018-10-21 18:54:25 Well, there again, ignorance is bliss for the left. We have the technology to burn coal cleaner than ever and I can tell you that the Timken oil burner was burning the most efficient and cleanly 60 years ago. Technology in place today burns fossil fuel as clean as you breathe.
2424 2018-10-21 18:54:20 It is very wrong to buy oil from that evil regime!

Trudeau said that he wanted to destroy Canada's energy sector and he has done that. 

It really makes me wonder why. 

I was always so proud of Alberta and proud of the oil and natural gas that we produced.

Can it be rescued?
2425 2018-10-21 18:54:03 “Theirs to begin with.”  No, we didn’t have to pay them.  And the sanctions relief was worth several times over what cash we gave them.  And Europe will not reimpose sanctions now that they’ve relieved them because they want that Iranian oil (something the US doesn’t need.)
2426 2018-10-21 18:53:56 At a certain point does it even matter? Khashoggi isn’t a US national or a citizen. Sanctions against the Saudis will cause more harm than good. Oil prices are going to skyrocket and it will hurt us all.
2427 2018-10-21 18:53:53 Especially when they said it was a little oil issue but it's no problem
2428 2018-10-21 18:53:48  wow! So now bc of continuous chats about thinning male hair, for approx a mo and sum chg... I'm now getting ads for hair growth oil and alopecia treatments and shit! They be listenin mayne!

2431 2018-10-21 18:53:03 @ScarbsTech @PeterDWindsor how do the @ScuderiaFerrari cars burn visible amounts of oil, without running a foul of the regulations?
2432 2018-10-21 18:52:56 If we had never messed w the ME might have been harder to get oil -but an oil shortage would have pushed us to renewable energy IMO. If world wants free trade best if petro $ declines. US uses trade to punish by sanctioning & hurts civilian populations. Time 2 quite bullying.

2438 2018-10-21 18:52:22 And, it could open up more plans, studies, companies, groups... that specialize in guiding oil and gas companies to safe and successful use of the land while growing the eco systems to their fullest.

2445 2018-10-21 18:51:31 My old lady uses 0W-20 and I use 5W-30. But my car is a 2003 I don’t use the fancy shit on mine anymore. I do however use the high mileage oil to keep it going strong.
2446 2018-10-21 18:51:27 dermatix apa ya yg di iklan2 itu, atau bio oil? gatau aku :(
2447 2018-10-21 18:51:19 That's an episode that needs re-listening, and note taking! It puts a whole new level of scary onto ready meals (rapeseed oil) and restaurant/take away food (Reheated, oxidised PUFAs)
Cooking with seed oils and breathing the fumes alone may cause lung cancer! 
2448 2018-10-21 18:51:10 Ads for what??
2449 2018-10-21 18:51:06 Moreover, I have called for a drought that will affect the fields, the hill country, the grain, new wine, fresh olive oil, a... Haggai 1:11
2450 2018-10-21 18:51:06 Flowers should be everywhere, especially in anger. Massage wild mint oil into your old baggage.
2451 2018-10-21 18:51:05 Well guess what? Not one President did shit when they knew the high hackers were from Saudi Arabia on 9/11.  Not Bush and not Obama so blame Trump for everything. Yeah right. Saudi Arabia has all the oil no one is going to do shit. So get over it!
2452 2018-10-21 18:51:04 Didn't we hear same bs after 9-11? When will republicans stop begging for oil money from terrorist financing nations? Didn't realize republican idea of patriotism is selling out their country for money...damn shame.  @SenateGOP @NBCNews @TheAtlantic @nytimes @mmfa
2453 2018-10-21 18:51:01 Are we going to bomb oil refineries? Coal powered electric plants? 

Gas climate deniers? 

God damn, she’s a dim bulb.
2454 2018-10-21 18:50:49 I would love to know basic car repairs. How to change a tire, or change the oil. Stuff like that.
2455 2018-10-21 18:50:45 week of 10/21: as everyone is saying - lots of bear flags out there looking like they broke down last week. now looking like updside down cup n handles. retest of lows seems likely, as does a complete breakdown. looking for swings, esp swing short oil $CL_F
2456 2018-10-21 18:50:32 also i went n bought tescos most expensive olive oil and i'd be a liar if i haven't considered asking for an old ass bottle of soy sauce for my xmas

Still dependent but not as much as I thought
2458 2018-10-21 18:50:20 A GDP of 19.4 trilllion dollars backed by oil, wars, and debt of 23 trillion dollars. Wait a few more ears when almost countries shun trading in dollars and tell us about this giant economy. There will never be a world dominated by USA. Welcome to a multipolar world baby!
2459 2018-10-21 18:50:17 In other news, Saudi Arabia should be ostracised as a pariah state, however, to do so gives their oil to Russia who is waiting in the wings for another ally.

It's all so sick.

I get the feeling the political classes are mainly about perpetuation of tyranny of political classes.
2460 2018-10-21 18:50:15 The media is very much to blame in the US. They are driving a wedge. It’s sad to see so many supporting a terrorist country like Saudi & our currency is backed by blood oil. We could have peace with another superpower w/strong nuke capabilities, but that can’t happen bc of elites
2461 2018-10-21 18:50:11 @SteveLetarte How much oil do the cup engines run?
2462 2018-10-21 18:50:06 Can potential weakness in demand pull oil price down sufficiently against a backdrop of rising shock to supply from geopolitical risks in a balanced market? Questionable!
2463 2018-10-21 18:50:02 So the Republicans want to keep the oil, banks, weapon manufacturers money? If you can point me to how to do that it would be appreciated :)
2464 2018-10-21 18:49:54 @mreazi Guy help me find work for Oil company na   My CV are intact
2465 2018-10-21 18:49:52 Tough love?
I'll pass
2466 2018-10-21 18:49:34 They are ( Saudi Arabia) supporting the war in Yemen for there oil !!
2467 2018-10-21 18:49:31 The amount of oil George put in that dish to cook those potatoes is honestly criminal. 
AND THEN HE POURED THE OIL DOWN THE SINK!?!?!?!?!?!?! Tit. 

#ComeDineWithMe
2468 2018-10-21 18:49:17 Why have we still not invaded the country that both bankrolled and supplied the terrorists for 9/11. Time to finish this fight where it started. Only time I've ever thought invading a country was justified. Destroy their oil reserves from the air burn it all down
2469 2018-10-21 18:49:07 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
2470 2018-10-21 18:49:07 Maybe we can get a discount on some that sweet Saudi oil we buy? Might lose some durrig transport but we dont have to dig it out of the ground!
2471 2018-10-21 18:49:05 The real you, who you really are is when you are in Bolivia, fishing in a 14 person group on a rainy 7-9pm wearing purple and canola oil yellow.
2472 2018-10-21 18:49:00 They probably use armpit oil to fry the plantain in your hall
2473 2018-10-21 18:48:47 Coincidently just when oil markets are balanced geopolitical risks are on the rise (And not just US policy driven) and the shock buffer excess supply played in 3years after 2014 oil price collapse is missing!
2474 2018-10-21 18:48:45 Hi! Well, I suposse that a lot of Spanish people have complained, hehe. Don´t worry, I think it's normal when someone cooks something about another country. My advice: eggs, potatoes and olive oil, nothing else! (Ok, now my people will say that I would put onions too ).
2475 2018-10-21 18:48:40 Venezuela is not failing because of socialism. They are under heavy US sanctions and their economy failed diversify before the fall in oil prices.
2476 2018-10-21 18:48:34 It was life changing for me when I realised the French use plenty of oil and salt in cooking (instead of a magic skill!) Also garlic. Salts like pink Himalayan also add different flavours. Nutmeg can really deaden a savoury dish I think.
2477 2018-10-21 18:48:33 seriously look em up...I was surprised,
And pull ya self together with your curtains.
2478 2018-10-21 18:48:30 Will you please stop getting unsustainable Palm oil from Wilmar. Set an example to others. Don't be party to deforestation
2479 2018-10-21 18:48:30 I should clarify that I use coconut milk, not the oil, for some baking recipes. If I used the oil think my body would just hate me: “Listen bitch, we already told you we don’t like this!”
2480 2018-10-21 18:48:26 OPEC created a gasoline shortage by banning oil exports this week in 1973. It got so bad, the only way to get gas in your car was to fill it with baked beans. 

Sorry. Oil jokes are usually crude.
2481 2018-10-21 18:48:25 [Dabs him with aroma oil]
2482 2018-10-21 18:48:12 That sounds great. New investments and reforestation and sustainable use of resources. 
However, that isn't something any conservative party has advocated. They double down on oil, coal and companies regulating themselves.
2483 2018-10-21 18:48:05 uh oh. I was gonna get their growth oil....so no?
2484 2018-10-21 18:48:03 Our devil pact with Saudi Arabia to support our oil addiction is further evidence we need independence from Mid East Oil and Gas! Solar and hydro are looking more and more enticing!

The oil & gas companies are leaving a trail of breadcrumbs....
2487 2018-10-21 18:48:01 70$ for some car oil smh
2488 2018-10-21 18:48:01 I’m petitioning my building for a brown bin now cause you can put  literally anything in them, oil, Fats meat, it all goes into a huge grinder and turned into city soil.
2489 2018-10-21 18:47:48 They have 24 hours and oil.
2490 2018-10-21 18:47:43 Just not true. If Solar was so economical why doesn’t everyone have panels on their homes? Or every business? Oil will be used long after we’re gone!
2491 2018-10-21 18:47:29 Don't talk with your mouth full.  And if I want to wear curtains I will
2492 2018-10-21 18:47:14 This could work for Ferrari, so long as Kimi has a rear oil, smoke or gun function

2493 2018-10-21 18:47:07 How do you intend to create job? Do you intend to transplant or import the institutions and infrastructure you didn't provide during your 16years rule? I still don't understand how you will provide jobs. Where will people work? PDP earned more from crude oil and squandered it.
2494 2018-10-21 18:47:03 If you like a lot of olive oil on your strudel, join our club!
2495 2018-10-21 18:46:55 I heard Bridget Gabriel on David Rubin. How r country got drawn into this hateful group of people (oil greed?).  Newt Gingrich was criticized for saying he would deport anyone who believes in sharia law. I happen to agree with him! Very dangerous, un-American 2 say the least!
2496 2018-10-21 18:46:50 I feel you!!! You should get yourself some face oil Jay...or use some coconut oil at night
2497 2018-10-21 18:46:41 Bio oil katanya bisa
2498 2018-10-21 18:46:35 Palm oil is a major problem that not many know about Iceland the only supermarket that has banned it Come On you big boys start making some changes its 2018 don't let these beautiful animals be a distant memory #orangutanfriendly
2499 2018-10-21 18:46:11 GP Prep done on the sprouts. Cleaned and sliced. Gonna sauté them in some butter and add a bit of basting oil at the end. So danged good.
2500 2018-10-21 18:46:05 A drop or 2 of olive oil or Italian dressing  goes a long way too.
2501 2018-10-21 18:45:52 The Chief Strategist of @ScuderiaFerrari should be drown in motor oil after this race.
2502 2018-10-21 18:45:40 have you looked them up ?????
Go on you will be very surprised.
2503 2018-10-21 18:45:36 Emaina President Trump, PM Modi kalisi Edo pedda plan chesarani doubt. Mottam oil desala economy naasanam chesi Ms ni anicheyyalani plana???
2504 2018-10-21 18:45:30 The real question on climate change is when are renewable resource companies going to start donating more than oil/gas companies to gov. campaigns and actually have an effect on the political stance on the climate crisis? Politicians will only believe what you pay them to believe
2505 2018-10-21 18:45:24 I do not claim to be a genius, but why do we continue to support Saudi Arabia?  I mean there is an oil glut, am I right.  This country is NOT our Ally. I their human rights violations..their treatment of women..not to mention most of the 9/11 hijackers shared a Saudi zip code
2506 2018-10-21 18:45:11 They’re fine with a little bit of oil and a little salt. Season them further if you want, but just toasting them dark enough is enough (which isn’t real dark.) if you wanted to get wild, you could add a little cayenne.
2507 2018-10-21 18:45:06 Yes, I have battled with two oil companies over the reclamation on conservation land we managed for years. I have a pretty good idea what happens.
2508 2018-10-21 18:45:03 Pick and pay borrowdale did that today for cooking oil. Buy groceries for $20 to buy cooking oil for $9, 5l
2509 2018-10-21 18:45:02 ohhh ok thank you i should try a oil before bed too bc that’s makes sense
2510 2018-10-21 18:44:59 I don't really understand why the US, as an oil exporter now, puts up with any Saudi crap. Do you need the bases that much? Or is it all of the weapons they buy, or what?
2511 2018-10-21 18:44:56 No joke this is serious..cause u got idiots who actually believe this lie...They're so full of his snake oil its beyond reasoning..the problem is Dems need to be on the mic..disputing ever lie without even mentioning that clowns name...
MARKETING 101
2512 2018-10-21 18:44:51 ...temporary fix, and it's only a suggestion at this point.  China has already announced that they will be buying plenty of oil from Iran.  China has it's own oil trading futures market using non-us dollars.  That market will expand quickly with Trump in office.
2513 2018-10-21 18:44:51 no YOU poured lots of rose oil and petals into your bath this evening, turned the lights off & lay there in the water, reading vita sackville-west by candlelight and sipping a glass of sauvignon blanc

2519 2018-10-21 18:44:19 The guy changing my oil muttered "195" in reference to the filter number; I, however, thought he meant the price and went pale and nearly choked on my coffee.
2520 2018-10-21 18:43:52 British Oil you mean?
2521 2018-10-21 18:43:36 FUN FACT: Oil monopolists and richest family in the world, Rockefeller’s built the World Trade Center - they also coincidentally benefited most from 3 New York buildings destruction & Federal Government’s actions that followed. 

DYK: Rockefeller’s funded and covered up MKUltra.
2522 2018-10-21 18:43:16 just rinsed my hair with rice water and lavender oil 
2523 2018-10-21 18:43:08 Republicans & Democrats approved this huge military budget we are too far into Middle East the last place to fall is Yemen. Look at the map it is 2 pipelines 1 oil 1 natural gas both needing the Yemen port for dispersion. War Powers Act Includes military use on our own citizens.
2524 2018-10-21 18:43:07 no he isn't. He and his alt-right friends in the Republican party are waging war on Iran. He is part of the neocons like Carl Rove, Dick Cheney. All war hawks. Remember Cheney started war in Iraq and when it was finished, Halliburton got the biggest contract for oil ?
2525 2018-10-21 18:42:56 Pluuase I asked you not to make a mockery
2526 2018-10-21 18:42:56 Very strange that this should be the "tipping point" in the Middle East. That Putin and Assad should be the ones still condemned. When women and children have been being kidnapped and threatened with death, and men keep passing more guns into the region to battle for oil.
2527 2018-10-21 18:42:54 After my death they will cut open my stomach and find a dense mass of thorns and blunt springs, caked in engine oil.
2528 2018-10-21 18:42:51 Boycot plastic. It hurts the oil industry
2529 2018-10-21 18:42:43 Where will you get oil from then?  Russia?  Iran?
2530 2018-10-21 18:42:31 Ending the slave trade would be a good gesture as well in Saudi Arabia and all the middle east that has been present under all administrations. Talk about the power of oil!
2531 2018-10-21 18:42:29 I don't know that I'd call Saudi Arabia much of an ally, either. They just have oil, which apparently wins them friends.
2532 2018-10-21 18:42:21 stormy please stop licking the coconut oil off my face
2533 2018-10-21 18:42:13 Oil is also traded in futures market. Yet its up at $80 a barrel. Commodities in short supply don't ignore fundamentals.

2545 2018-10-21 18:41:18 The real world runs on oil. You have not addressed major flaws in "let get rid of oil" you live in a fantasy where you think we can just abandon oil and keep this modern world we enjoy.

2550 2018-10-21 18:41:06 Mine are more related to car maintenance.... changing a tire, changing the oil, re-inflating tires to appropriate levels... that kind of stuff
2551 2018-10-21 18:41:01 What will Congress do?  Trump does not want to do anything to offend the Saudis due to concerns about arm sales $4 or $ 100 billion, oil, and other things. 
Is this just lip service..
2552 2018-10-21 18:40:52 Oil is not going away anytime soon and they will take it from the ground until something cheaper is found and makes them MORE money
2553 2018-10-21 18:40:51 Keep up the pressure!   Saudi's can cut off oil to Canada and we can use our own.... Lol. Duhhh
2554 2018-10-21 18:40:36 Once all of the federally protected wild horses are removed from OUR public lands, the Trump Administration will turn OUR public lands into oil and mining toxic sites. Please stand with the 80% of Americans who want our wild horses and burros protected!

2571 2018-10-21 18:38:52 See you next marCh.  Enjoy the ride.  Risk averse.  Don't come running to me when you need a new handbag cus there aint't gonna be anything left. I'm getting my next summer frocks being made up from curtains.  Well damn it won't I just be the prettiest x
2572 2018-10-21 18:38:47 For soup, cook ground shallots in oil, then simmer with turkey, cilantro, chicken broth and mushrooms. Top with sour cream.
2573 2018-10-21 18:38:46 In my country we eat rice and lentils with everything. So that, with homemade chili (garlic, ginger, chili, lime, salt and sunflower oil). Cold for breakfast, hot for dinner. Heaven.
2574 2018-10-21 18:38:45 Similarly, they lied about 9/11; if we can reduce oil consumption and derive new alternate forms of energy we won't have to worship them and their Oil and God and King...and look the other way when they arbitrarily murder innocent people.
2575 2018-10-21 18:38:27 @walmart I used to manage a Tire and Lube at one of your locations and the one in #SpringfieldOhio taking 3 or 4 hours just to do an oil change when it was hardly busy at all is ridiculous. Happens everytime we for oil change. They should at the most take no longer than 90 min.
2576 2018-10-21 18:38:23 What kind of oil do u use ?
2577 2018-10-21 18:38:04 Cows emit more methane than the oil industry and are a huge factor in global warming. #fact
2578 2018-10-21 18:37:36 Anything but glazers. At least we know these oil rich guys are in it for the love of football
2579 2018-10-21 18:37:28 You get trained early to look for canola oil
2580 2018-10-21 18:37:05 Usko pehle samjhao oil bond kyaa hai..
2581 2018-10-21 18:37:02 Haha mummy has called you back home Femi...she prepared your fave palm oil dodo
2582 2018-10-21 18:36:37 มีความสุขในทุกวันนะครับ คนเก่งของ อคน. #OneandOnlyBIDAY
2583 2018-10-21 18:36:34 I am "excited about the new easy pour 5 quart engine oil bottle" years old.
2584 2018-10-21 18:36:27 What an obnoxious response. Your assertion that oil-bearing strata transmit seismic shocks identically to non-oil-bearing strata requires substantiation.  Has this hypothesis been tested ?
2585 2018-10-21 18:36:16 Changing the oil pan on my car today . Hope it goes smoothly.  Also recording it aswell for a youtube video. Wish me luck!
2586 2018-10-21 18:36:06 Trump got the playtime and look what happened there. Peddling snake oil, interviews at BBC for him is like taking candy from baby..She did the right thing and shut him down#Brexit
2587 2018-10-21 18:35:55 Im using the toner, day cream and oil boo
2588 2018-10-21 18:35:50 Halftime at Lucas Oil: Colts 24, Bills 0.

And no, Frank Reich will not step in at QB for Bills in 2nd half.

One miracle comeback was enough.
2589 2018-10-21 18:35:49 Dawg feels like my stomach needs an oil change or sum
2590 2018-10-21 18:35:41 Of course he did. @jeffflake is just another snake oil salesman like DJT. Although he presents himself as more gentlemanly...look at his voting record. 

Underneath that veneer he is just as cruel and evil.
2591 2018-10-21 18:35:34 Feeling stuck? Try making some art using oil pastels - consider the concept of vacations in a relaxed style.
2592 2018-10-21 18:35:32 Tea Tree oil numbs your lips like Cocaine
2593 2018-10-21 18:35:26 Red Bull shooting themselves in the foot again with car reliability. Engineer seen removing oil from the car on the grid? Looked like complete power unit failure. Gotta feel bad for the badge @danielricciardo
2594 2018-10-21 18:35:22 Today, I dropped a bottle of olive oil. I’m pretty sure that’s the Lebanese version of me being cursed for 7 years.
2595 2018-10-21 18:35:18 Our money, little insignificant Scotland and our oil and our military you won’t have, all those jobs lost and what will you have Lucazade and some salmon.
2596 2018-10-21 18:35:00 Cows emit more methane than the oil industry and are a huge factor in global warming.
2597 2018-10-21 18:34:21 I love that they think Maduro stealing from social programs after their main export of oil plummeted in value is an example of socialism failing, but having to sell your home due to medical debt isn't an example of capitalism failing...
2598 2018-10-21 18:34:15 @FLOURNOYFarrell The sole reason for Trump pulling out of the IRAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS DEAL was to satisfy SAUDI ARABIA. $150B in ARMS sales were part of the devil's bargain & SAUDI ARABIA got to usurp Iran in supplying BILLIONS OF DOLLARS worth of OIL.
2599 2018-10-21 18:34:13 Lots of oil money in the foundation just a guess
2600 2018-10-21 18:34:05 i had a dream last night i was working on a oil painting and now i want to start a oil painting.

 i also had a dream i was mr potatoman running around NYC so if yall wanna help me figure out what i should take away from that one that would be nice
2601 2018-10-21 18:33:44 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil. My cup runs over. Surely goodness and loving kindness shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
Psalm 23:5-6
2602 2018-10-21 18:33:26 Just a drizzle of olive oil and honey, M&S yorkies, but not frozen
2603 2018-10-21 18:33:22 Oil Slick. Perversion. Zero. Black Velvet. Black Market. @UrbanDecay have SO MANY different black eyeliners. My goth little heart needs all of them.
2604 2018-10-21 18:33:22 More problem is the oil spillage in the ocean system during exploration and transportation.
2605 2018-10-21 18:33:12 By August 45 it was over for Japan. Even before the atomic bombs. Shipping lanes disrupted, navy crippled, Air Force best pilots depleted, no oil and scattered armies. None of that happened in Manchuria in 42-45
2606 2018-10-21 18:33:05 @scottishlabour have a lot to answer for. The oil was just starting to gush at that point. That wee quine and her family would have been seeing the benefits of oil rich Scotland today but for the labour party in Scotland..
2607 2018-10-21 18:33:04 Same. I had an oil cleanser with coconut oil -my fault for not reading ingredients- and my skin had to recovery after just two uses.
2608 2018-10-21 18:33:03 No on G is distorting everything.  That $4 million from Chevron is inundating us with bs.  Current production isn't impacted, they want the Oil Sands in North County called Monterey Shale.  Really dirty oil.
2609 2018-10-21 18:33:01 Reserve is to civilized society what oil is to an engine: indispensable. Without its lubrication, there will be friction, heat, and, eventually, catastrophic failure. Most of our stray thoughts and feelings merit neither vocalizing nor analyzing.
2610 2018-10-21 18:32:58 Yes but capitalismat what cost? With what regulation? Unfettered capitalism has dire environmental consequences that the Cons should consider! As well as financial inequality that fuels most social ills. They cannot continue to support oil sands. The UN report says tax Carbon!
2611 2018-10-21 18:32:57 I hate coming to get my cars oil changed
2612 2018-10-21 18:32:55 Take one of those tomatoes, grate the flesh into a pulp add generous glugs of olive oil and chopped garlic and parsley spread on some toasty bread
2613 2018-10-21 18:32:53 Watching ‘Salt Fat Acid Heat’ has had me waking up dreaming of Olive Oil two days in a row. This is especially disturbing given I have to spend the rest of the day figuring out what to cook in said oil. #TasteTests
2614 2018-10-21 18:32:51 it was more about popping the rice in the fridge for 20 minutes after cooking it, got the texture right. but i just did onions garlic peas carrots sesame oil mirin vinegar five spice cayenne soy sauce salt and shrimp. oh and oyster sauce
2615 2018-10-21 18:32:46 I'd prefer people acknowledge the severe civil and constitutional disadvantages Scotland has endured for centuries as their motivation for seeking self-governance, even the theft of Scotland's oil will do, rather than loss of EU membership, but I guess I'll take what's offered.
2616 2018-10-21 18:32:40 @iammikemitchell FF and an INT in his first game in Lucas Oil as a Colt! HELL YES!
2617 2018-10-21 18:32:34 @SkySportsF1 #AskCrofty  Vettel has a lot more oil burn smoke coming out of his car than usual? Happening on straight as well not just curves.
2618 2018-10-21 18:32:32 Plastic is just a waste product from the oil industry if they didn't use it in everyday objects there would be costs involved in disposing of the waste but I still say get rid and use celulllose instead which is  disposable and  more natural
2619 2018-10-21 18:32:28 Nice.  He can afford a season ticket pass now.
2620 2018-10-21 18:32:26 Is anyone else’s skin ridiculously dry this time of year....or is that just me?? Thank god for facial oil
2621 2018-10-21 18:32:20 saltwater soak, or a tiny bit of tea tree oil if u have it
2622 2018-10-21 18:32:18 “That’s the cbd oil.”
2623 2018-10-21 18:32:02 I drink juices with cbd oil now.
2624 2018-10-21 18:31:54 Like a place where oil springs up from the ground if you dig and you can fly on a magic carpet?
2625 2018-10-21 18:31:51 Talking about subsidy..we wouldn't have known anything if not for PMB govt that oil subsidy has bn a falasy that became strong force during Obj/Atiku govt..a force to enrich themselves and families..
2626 2018-10-21 18:31:49 Of course they are lying. CNN needs to do a better job explaining to international viewers United States connection to Saudi Arabia. It isn't just Trump, Obama, George Bush also cozy with the Saudis. Yes oil and there geographical location in Middle East important.
2627 2018-10-21 18:31:48 A Democrat say they're sorry? They'd rather boil in a pot of hot oil before apologizing for anything!
2628 2018-10-21 18:31:45 If you think Im talking rubbish then check out #phe 
Could be the future of recycling ..Boom! Boom !
2629 2018-10-21 18:31:40 I'd love to write a fiction thriller based on the GCHQ and MI5 ..interwoven with something ( terror, money laundering, arms race, crude oil, etc ). Of course MI6 will have to be a part
2630 2018-10-21 18:31:36 Could low oil prices have reshaped geopolitical calculations?
2631 2018-10-21 18:31:28 To coin the phrase, "very sceptical" about next year, even next month ... Definitely sticking it under the mattress and buying Spam cus you can't eat handbags x
2632 2018-10-21 18:31:23 For Generations how ironic we willingly give our treasure to these bandits for only oil to sow our sorrow, moral degradation and planetary end of our species - surely a depressing classic Shakespearian tragedy hit. Can't wait for the intermission.
2633 2018-10-21 18:31:20 Ayappa devotion is not just like any other temple. We just don't decide and visit..one undertakes a 41 day Vrath which includes no non veg, one meal a day, pray at least twice a day to Ayyapa, no foot wear no adornments not even hair oil. In short sanyasa for 41 days.
2634 2018-10-21 18:31:06 Vitamin C, zinc, and oil of oregano! Oil of oregano is literal magic. It’s a natural antibiotic 
2635 2018-10-21 18:31:00 After dashing her oil block. Well done sirs
2636 2018-10-21 18:30:52 That sucks. Are there acids you can eat? Oil+acid+flavoring (fruit, herbs, aromatics) is a basic recipe for dressings that hopefully you can work from. Other good acids are lemon and lime  juice etc. I wish I could think of some others that aren't citrus but that's a tough one.
2637 2018-10-21 18:30:40 Chamisa wanted to create spaghetti roads , Mnangagwa is creating spaghetti lines for fuel and cooking oil .

2639 2018-10-21 18:30:22 and who ever controls saudia’s oil i.e being USA,controls the oil supply for all big asian countries like japan,china europe russia
2640 2018-10-21 18:30:18 Olive oil stinks tho....
2641 2018-10-21 18:30:18 I’m about to make REAL pizza rolls with garlic, oregano and olive oil brushed on top.
2642 2018-10-21 18:30:16 Take it up with @barronsonline.   

FWIW, this post has higher engagement rate than my other post today about oil supply! What does that tell you about what #OOTT & #fintwit readers find worth their attention?
2643 2018-10-21 18:30:16 But did you put palm oil?
2644 2018-10-21 18:30:08 If they were burdened with oil they wouldn't be independent.
2645 2018-10-21 18:30:02 We expect all those who share a sound vision with us to have good character and an impeccable social behavior.
2646 2018-10-21 18:30:00 I realize that. I just thought it was a stupid answer they gave you about electric space heaters, so was quipping at being oil or wood fired. Not making light of it.
2647 2018-10-21 18:29:59 Lucas Oil is a neat atmosphere, though, I’m still having a nice time #gobills
2648 2018-10-21 18:29:56 Johnson’s baby oil!!
2649 2018-10-21 18:29:38 Eat a fish oil pill: 

Another thing marked off my bucket list
2650 2018-10-21 18:29:20 You better figure out where we would get our oil first
2651 2018-10-21 18:29:08 A FOOL WITHOUT OIL !!
2652 2018-10-21 18:29:01 It’s getting cold make sure y’all double up on the lotion/oil
2653 2018-10-21 18:28:59 A botch oil chang took 5mins literally lol
2654 2018-10-21 18:28:48 Hi sa mga kamag anak na feeling close pag may kailangan. 
2655 2018-10-21 18:28:36 You can't. It's a classical French thing - just egg yolks and olive oil. And maybe dijon mustard. Anything else and you cannot technically call it mayonnaise....
2656 2018-10-21 18:28:35 Sadly this is very common to find sneaky plastic hiding in cardboard boxes - you will find yourself doing the ‘squeeze and shake’  Oliva soap from Holland and Barrett is completely plastic and palm oil free - it’s also not very expensive. #plasticfreeplanet
2657 2018-10-21 18:28:16 The Goat has had an interesting day. But when you are the Goat, you get bounces like that
Blowout going on in Lucas Oil. 24-0. 
2658 2018-10-21 18:28:13 Oil & water baby .
Oil & water baby.
2659 2018-10-21 18:28:04 Gotta love that cbd oil
2660 2018-10-21 18:27:46 This sample of @mydrunkelephant luxury face oil is amazing!!  I need all their products in my life 
2661 2018-10-21 18:27:45  at least it ddnt say that give and oil will
2662 2018-10-21 18:27:34 Two GOP senators say US should end arms sales to Saudis; Trump wants to continue deal @CNNPolitics https://cnnc......agree, let's get out of the Middle East altogether!.....is oil that important?
2663 2018-10-21 18:27:27 someone need a massage, full body with warm oil?
2664 2018-10-21 18:27:23 @CartiaMallan invest in a good quality CBD oil!
2665 2018-10-21 18:26:54 Giving or selling, the point is we SHOULDN’T. Saudi Arabia is a murderous dictatorship, and just because they have oil and money the GOP have been kissing their terrorist asses since 9/11/2001, which the saudis organized, financed and executed. DONT SEND THEM WEAPONS !
2666 2018-10-21 18:26:54 Since I was able to find out the mass of the oil drop and calculate the force of gravity on a given drop, I could determine the electric charge that the drop must have.
2667 2018-10-21 18:26:41 1) Oil of Every Pearl’s Un-insides 
2) Dead Magic 
3) Frank Ocean’s Endless 
4) Dirty Computer
5) All Against Logic
2668 2018-10-21 18:26:38 Put a few drops of essential oil in it for a nice aroma while you scrub away your dreams.
2669 2018-10-21 18:26:38 he is a fraud and snake oil sales man! Just another billionaire without touch on reality! can’t keep electing these rich white men and expect different results. DO NOT BE A LEMMING
2670 2018-10-21 18:26:36 Love it, thanks
2671 2018-10-21 18:26:29 خليك في خاشقجي لايهمك ال 80 سوري
2672 2018-10-21 18:26:29 Blackstone to buy oil services firm Ulterra for $700 million: sources
2673 2018-10-21 18:26:27 Where were they going with that cooking oil lot?
2674 2018-10-21 18:26:24 Maybe we should stop importing their oil as well? Perhaps we could replace Saudi oil with Canadian oil? Just a thought...
2675 2018-10-21 18:26:19 What I did was, put a charge on a tiny drop of oil, measure how strong the electric field had to be so it could stop the oil drop from falling.
2676 2018-10-21 18:26:18 @JoeBiden said he didnt care if your family came 150 years ago or 4 days ago, but like every Democrat makes no distinction between coming in the front door, asking, or crawling over a fence without permission. 
We've all seen antifa "brownshirts" in action

2681 2018-10-21 18:25:55 Friend suggested to rub Lavender oil under nose instead of wasting on fabric.
2682 2018-10-21 18:25:51 LOL good! Please take your ball and go home, MBS. We don't need your oil in a Faustian bargain anymore.
2683 2018-10-21 18:25:44 يافرحة امك المسكينة فيك، اتقوا الله تعالى في امهاتكم واهلكم ماهمكم الا انفسكم.. الوطن اصلا مستغني عن اشكالكم لا زدتم ولا انقصتم
2684 2018-10-21 18:25:38 They dont want trump to destroy their (very open) plan. Learn Chinas issues w regulation and corruption environment (Paris Accord). Mines and which previous admin allowed greed and destruction& sacrificing your own civilians.I lived in UAE. I know whats up around oil, war,China.
2685 2018-10-21 18:25:37 Castor oil rubbed into your scalp is supposed to be really good , my eyebrows are so thin naturally it helps grow them out
2686 2018-10-21 18:25:36 Details are nuts! Looks like an oil painting.
2687 2018-10-21 18:25:29 Olive Garden breadsticks are cool and all but Bertucci’s rolls with oil????? Unreal. Don’t @ me

2690 2018-10-21 18:25:18 When you drop chicken you damn near got to put your fingers in the oil a lil just so it won’t splash back
2691 2018-10-21 18:25:16 Ghawar oil Field would do it, maybe.
2692 2018-10-21 18:24:47 My gen is getting old 
Carburetor spoil today 
Oil switch tomorrow 
2693 2018-10-21 18:24:45 thanks for letting me know, i barely ever use acrylic ive only ever used oil(which is a bitch to clean anyway as you know and ironically the white spirit cant be safe for me either lmao) because ive always avoided using it for shoots and setups just in case
2694 2018-10-21 18:24:34 They can pipe the water to Jordan & charge for it. They can drill the oil. The land will belong to Trump Corp Saudi Arabia Egypt & Israel making them richer. Trump sees his hotels on the shores of the Arabian Gulf & on the shores of North Korea. That is what all of this is about
2695 2018-10-21 18:24:29 On a Sunday? I thought oil change places respected the Sabbath and kept it holy.
2696 2018-10-21 18:24:26 oh absolutely- with marijuana it’s at least the positive effects can be compared with the potential negative impacts. cbd oil is a great way to reduce some effects!

it boggles my mind that cigs are legal and accessible while weed is severely criminalized in a lot of the country.

2702 2018-10-21 18:23:56 #Oil
Africa has abadunce of oil. thesecountries produce oil. 
1. Angola
2.Mozambique
3. Gabon 
4. Equatorial Guinea
5. Nigeria
6. Kenya 
These polities hv close proximity to SA n oil was supposed 2 b cheap so that African inter-trade is strengthened 2 create local employment
2703 2018-10-21 18:23:39 Our defense is ass right now. Just everybody need some coconut oil. Wake the fuck up!!!!!!!!
2704 2018-10-21 18:23:28  you bought Goya beans but it doesn’t matter... when you put the palm oil and senrenren, you should get the regular color
2705 2018-10-21 18:23:27 It's 40 degrees outside and Marisa just had every window in the house open talking about she's hot.. the girl is in sweat pants and a furry jacket inside. I'm sorry do you pay for the oil?
2706 2018-10-21 18:23:27 The move will bite him in his butt.  Ethanol is bad for engines.  U.S. Oil producers are hitting a production limit.  Foreign oil tariffs directed at US Oil companies are limiting global demand.  Farmers should be learning by now not to trust Trump's policies.

2708 2018-10-21 18:23:21 @MarijuanaInc Is Cannabis oil slippery?
2709 2018-10-21 18:23:19 Gibraltar doesn't have any oil, so it isn't needed to prop up the "UK single market".
2710 2018-10-21 18:23:19 It’s so amazing that the #Bible can keep pouring out unending treasures of revelation and #wisdom to keep one fed in life. It’s like the oil that kept filling the widow’s vessels and the fish & loaves that were multiplied in Jesus’s hands! God supplies till you say it’s enough!

2712 2018-10-21 18:23:10 @KelloggsUK will you consider using rapeseed oil , less “air” miles grown in the UK, support British farmers and zero effect on rain forests sustainable it not?
2713 2018-10-21 18:23:02 Y u r confused b/w employment n Govt jobs? N economy is far better and Oil prices aren't making country Bankrupt! So for me its a good to go trend!
2714 2018-10-21 18:23:01 No. The Enclave was a shadow branch of the prewar US government. When the bombs fell they ran to bunkers and safe houses like the rest. The biggest group just happened to be on the oil rig.
2715 2018-10-21 18:22:55 I meant use lard. Don't use oil.
2716 2018-10-21 18:22:52 I'd say it's a quarter past midnight.
2717 2018-10-21 18:22:48 Most definitely. It’s ridiculous that we import oil from the ME
2718 2018-10-21 18:22:42 It’s about the oil, what don’t you get. They have us over a few million barrels.
2719 2018-10-21 18:22:35 EURO SHOCK - KHASHOGGI
Joke!
3 X EU Leaders demand Saudi Arabia c/clean or else.
I am sick of this nonsense! EU can do zero without USA backing, yet they insult DT at every turn.
EU depends on Russian oil/gas. If OPEC raises per barrel oil cost, Russia ups price.
Let POTUS fix it
2720 2018-10-21 18:22:31 Life is so much simpler when you drive a 2011 Honda Accord. Oil change once every 3 months. Practical Af and dependable. I love it.
2721 2018-10-21 18:22:29 I need to make more black soap shampoo but I need to get oil and I don’t feel like going anywhere. I’m going to finish these peach whiskey tea and decide later.
2722 2018-10-21 18:22:29 olive oil makers love it
2723 2018-10-21 18:22:22 Finally, much oil derived fuel CAN be replaced by 1) biofuels & especially 2) methanol & derivatives made from cheap abundant natural gas.
2724 2018-10-21 18:22:21 In 1910, I improved my experiment by replacing water with oil.

2726 2018-10-21 18:21:53 Didn't catch it but one guy in industry allied to the oil and gas exploitation firms said to me "we'll kill your cows, poison your land. If you tell anyone I said this I will deny it". The fracking project here in Groningen, a lot of damage to people's property is an ongoing saga
2727 2018-10-21 18:21:53 I like your style chidzoka so we can court you in cooking oil
2728 2018-10-21 18:21:36 First Impression: 'Never turn your back on Ocean, a cruel Mistress who will leave you in distress and her Sister, Sea will see to it that you are awash in anguish if you do not heed their warning, waves of turmoil will dissolve your suntan oil with sand in every nook and cranny'.
2729 2018-10-21 18:21:31 Is the @ScuderiaFerrari burning a bit of oil again? Looked like a bit of smoke coming out of Vettels car as he gassed it. And they have the pace back again this weekend #C4F1
2730 2018-10-21 18:21:30 finally Agip oil has finally brought our stable Non stop Light in our Lodge.
2731 2018-10-21 18:21:30 Thank you, no threat to stop importing Saudi oil after Reporter is killed, in a consulate nonetheless, and the lies keep growing daily about this event. Crickets from Canadian govt on that front, but Western Canada oil is still taboo.
2732 2018-10-21 18:21:29 sheet mask! skincare guru suka hype dr morite punyaa, toner hatomugi pun ok buat sheetmasking, besar & price ok, aku ada lebih ingat nak let go, kalau kau nak aku ada sekali diy sheet mask - both aku pakai aku sukaa

2733 2018-10-21 18:21:00 if i were to inject coconut oil into my veins i wonder how fast i would die
2734 2018-10-21 18:20:51 In the very near future gasoline will be obsolete and you won't be able to give  away your oil, I hope your prepared for that day that you lose your "strategic ally" position. The whole middle east better be ready, the faucets will shut off sooner than later.
2735 2018-10-21 18:20:51 1. pasta gigi: Pepsodent

2736 2018-10-21 18:20:49 who is strong & brave & can help me get all those oil stains out of my clothes (i’ll pay you $)
2737 2018-10-21 18:20:47 The Saudis hate America and everything America stands for.  Their only interests in the US is to sell us oil and buy deadly weapons from us.
2738 2018-10-21 18:20:43 Neither of these guys are named Pierre Lebrun who is the guy Pete uses for that sort of thing.
2739 2018-10-21 18:20:39 BLOOD is thicker than WATER
Oil is also thicker
2740 2018-10-21 18:20:30 Well he’s progressive and wants to support local business, that’s good. The hate for oil is short sighted. As an Albertan I’m ok with oil not going to sea, but then we need to upgrade pipelines within Canada and stop buying from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.
2741 2018-10-21 18:20:23 You know how I feel about oil of oregano
2742 2018-10-21 18:20:13 Accidentally put lavender essential oil in my diffuser instead of peppermint so I’m going back to sleep and I’ll try again tomorrow
2743 2018-10-21 18:20:10 They just get away with anything due to oil , money and investment and arms sold by Western governments. 
Nothing to see here !
2744 2018-10-21 18:20:05 My sister would swear palm oil rice is her favourite when she doesn't have enough vegetable oil to make stew.
All lies
2745 2018-10-21 18:20:01 Whatever you do, come out with a clear message you will not touch the new pop legislation, or else you have lost before you start.  There are bigger items that the pot, economy, oil pipelines,
2746 2018-10-21 18:20:00 Obligatory old person “McDonalds fries are trash since they switched to vegetable oil” post.

(it’s true)
2747 2018-10-21 18:19:26 Couldn't find my rapeseed oil anywhere so ended up roasting potatoes in EVOI - just went to fridge and found it!!

2751 2018-10-21 18:18:38 my curls really look like mattys rn thks argan oil
2752 2018-10-21 18:18:35 Their num-num nibbits submerged in rose oil / anointed rose oil slithered into their twitching rosebud
2753 2018-10-21 18:18:28 No, they just know the world doesn't care nearly as much about human rights as we do about cheap Saudi oil.
2754 2018-10-21 18:18:25 A small population,  roughly 6 million, with average GDP growth of almost 5% over last 3 years. Economy contracting at over 4%, likely not to get any better in regards to in country conditions and people leaving.
2755 2018-10-21 18:18:16 LMAO. Turkey was supporting ISIS by flooding arms into Syria in exchange for the stolen Syrian oil. ISIS was supported by the SUNNI GULF STATES. So let me get this straight. Turkey WORKS with the Gulf on toppling ASSAD. Obama is FULLY AWARE OF THIS. Trump comes into office 1/2
2756 2018-10-21 18:18:04 Deployment of freedom pellets from aerial pellet dispensaries may result in “Freedom” for oil reserves.
2757 2018-10-21 18:17:57 Yeah. But they sell us oil and we sell them the Arms they use to kill Yemen women and children.
2758 2018-10-21 18:17:36 Or....how persuasive we've been in getting South American natives to get the f**k off our oil properties. We are masters at making people see their own self interests.
2759 2018-10-21 18:17:35 and of course 1 cubic meter of #biochar / h and 100 liters of pyrolysis oil
2760 2018-10-21 18:17:34 Spain, the new Venezuela with no oil at all!
2761 2018-10-21 18:17:24 A) No leftists I am aware of are promoting antifa. Antifa is anti-fascist. Not party affiliated.
B) Dems vote for war budgets. That's the opposite of left. Use that as a litmus test for "lefties."
C) The Democratic party is complicit in murdering brown people for oil worldwide.
2762 2018-10-21 18:17:24 If they just stopped importing foreign oil, and found world markets for our energy, they would have lots of room for the flamboyant spending habits of the Liberal Government.
2763 2018-10-21 18:17:24 Probably the opposite to you, too much oil lol. I just throw it in the pan we cook eggs in as its always got plenty in to cover the eggs
2764 2018-10-21 18:17:20 I’ll tell you why. There are 2 islands between Yemen Gaza & Africa on the coast of Eritrea. They have untapped oil. The first thing Trump did is go dance with the Saudi King & Egyptian President then we had the Glowing Orb scene. Egypt then gave Saudi Arabia one of those
2765 2018-10-21 18:17:17 To much Packaging and waste from oil derived products also.
2766 2018-10-21 18:17:15 I bought a Lavender essential oil at tk.280.
*product price range is reasonable,
*delivery time is good
* product quality is good
2767 2018-10-21 18:16:50 HAVE NO PATIENCE FOR THESE CLOWNS WHO ARE LIVING IN THE BEFORE CHRIST AGE OF HUMANITY! OVER IT ROVER! 911 WAS ENOUGH TO PUT UP AND FORGIVE YOU! NOT GOING TO WORK ANYMORE! YOU NEED TO CHANGE AND FAST & NOT CHANGE IN YOUR OOEY GOOEY SLOW DRIPPING CLOGGED OIL PIPE MANNER! WORLD
2768 2018-10-21 18:16:41 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, or revisit them.
2769 2018-10-21 18:16:26 Saudi Arabia
- importance to the U.S. 
•U.S. startups: Largest single funding source
•U.S crude oil: 2nd-largest source of U.S. imports
•Past 25 years: Exported 12 billion barrels of oil to the U.S.
•Biggest buyer of U.S. arms/weapons
•Counterweight to Iran


2770 2018-10-21 18:16:06 He looks like the lead singer of Midnight Oil on bath salts.
2771 2018-10-21 18:16:01 @karaswisher clearly social media companies have not considered the consequences of their platforms, but how is that different from the tabaco, oil, sugar, and meat industries which not only ignored the consequences but actively hid research that pointed them out?
2772 2018-10-21 18:15:59 @lushcosmetics any chance of making your beard oil from Father's Day a permanent product? Most of your male employees have beards so there's a market right there beyond actual customers hah.
2773 2018-10-21 18:15:35 Is it made with balm oil too?
2774 2018-10-21 18:15:34 And lets not forget all of the 'law and order' candidates.

Some years back in Texas (1998, I think) a candidate - GOP of course - for the Railroad Commission ran on a 'law and order' platform.

The Texas Railroad Commission, BTW, regulates the oil & gas industry in the state.
2775 2018-10-21 18:15:27 I will go get an oil change and furniture for the house before I get hair and nails done. That’s the difference between me and you bitches.
2776 2018-10-21 18:15:21 I made a mix of olive oil, vitamin e oil and tea tree oil and it helps lock moisture and clear my skin
2777 2018-10-21 18:15:19 Maybe you should give it more time. 
Spritz a little water on your hair before applying the oil.
2778 2018-10-21 18:15:09 RT @LivingSafely: Brominated vegetable oil ("BVO") in your sodas this October? This flame retardant can be used to prevent separation.

2786 2018-10-21 18:14:19 Always use lard for the fat. Gets hotter than oil, also chill the batter first.
2787 2018-10-21 18:14:15 As far as hydrogen's explosive properties go - we've literally been driving around for 100 years strapped to a combustion chamber.  Most alternative energies, including EVs, still rely on oil as the source. The battery has to be filled somehow, and it doesn't all come from regen.
2788 2018-10-21 18:14:04 Why did the Bushes and the others do that? It can’t be just oil.
2789 2018-10-21 18:13:57 كنتُ من معجبين العرفج و لكنني أستحي من أن يستمر هذا الاعجاب ، ما بال العرفج يلعق الاحدية و يغض طرفه عن الحق ، هذا الاسبوع الحافل الذي دكره المديع حافل بموت صحفي سعودي و قلم حر و العرفج منشغل عن هذا  .

2796 2018-10-21 18:13:16 Trump supports a regime that murders with impunity, has lobbyists here pinpointing dissenters of the regime, preys on innocent Yemenis because: A). we need their oil (we really don't) B.) Iran (he started those problems) C.Trump will lose face if he doesn't. D. all of the above
2797 2018-10-21 18:13:13 my dumb ass thought my car was just low on brake oil but my shit was gliding across the freeway from side to side
2798 2018-10-21 18:13:11 For the longest time, I thought that hot oil and damp was just what all car interiors smelled like. The whole time I was growing up, my family never had a car newer than about 20 years old, and several were over 30.
2799 2018-10-21 18:12:52 I just recently got the shea moisture vegan daily hydration salve bc even my good hempz lotion and my super-thick Palmer's coconut oil cream weren't enough with how much my hands are in water at work, and it's been really good so far! I'm still using the other two in between tho
2800 2018-10-21 18:12:44 @BizNasty2point0  Just ordered my @UrbalActiv CBD oil and Balm. Thanks for the Promo code!
2801 2018-10-21 18:12:30 You agree that we have to leave the oil and gas in the ground though, aye?
2802 2018-10-21 18:12:24 Solar production would cut into "MARKET SHARE" of energy produced by oil and its refined products. Its market share decline, would lower its market price (GAS) Solar application would increase housing demand and availability, transportation would benefit as well.
2803 2018-10-21 18:12:22 Dear Sir,
Higher oil price = higher revenues for governments & higher returns for the Upstream & Downstream sectors.
OPEC & IGU are cartels that enjoy making a mickey of all OECD bloc & Developing Nations..
2804 2018-10-21 18:12:18 @LushLtd when are you getting Jason and the argon oil shampoo bar back in stock. It’s the best product I’ve ever used ... I’m struggling :)
2805 2018-10-21 18:12:10 youre  spreading fake news. No one suggesting cutting ties but we must send a clear message that this type of inhuman conduct is unaccpetable. This should be a globally united message. Cut ties can end up with $200 crude. we must be independant of foreign oil. That path is 2o far
2806 2018-10-21 18:12:05 Topic : Car maintenance 
Do you effort to maintain of car such as wash, checking oil or some parts. I’m working part time job in gas station for 4 years. Occasionally, I find duty or broken cars. Also No fuel in tank, but those customer put in only 1 or 2 thousand ¥.
2807 2018-10-21 18:11:46 All that whisky and oil.
2808 2018-10-21 18:11:36 Rose, I see  small drops of sweat & oil (coconut or argan oil ) glowing in the third picture ... I'm not hallucinating from the cold,  I hope

2810 2018-10-21 18:11:23 Keep up the good work Fiona, you are doing a great job. Don't let these snake oil salesmen get you down!
2811 2018-10-21 18:11:19 Using baby oil gel to shave is the besttttt
2812 2018-10-21 18:11:15 @POTUS Fuck Saudi Arabia there responsible for 9-11 even threatened Canada with a 9-11 type of attack, let kick there ass and take there oil.
2813 2018-10-21 18:11:12 Do we have anyone from Zimbabwe ? Kindly confirm the queues I saw for cooking oil
2814 2018-10-21 18:11:08 X
Tonight Greg,
One of these days i'm going to cut you into little pieces.
Add garlic granules.
An avocado crumb,
Fry in south facing olive tree olive oil,
and serve on a pretentious lake of pimento strawberries with a Yak face Jus.
2815 2018-10-21 18:11:06 Thyme oil and coconut oil. Mix 1/2 of each.
2816 2018-10-21 18:11:06 Hot bath with some lavender oil in and a glass of wine.
2817 2018-10-21 18:10:47 Need them for my snake oil
2818 2018-10-21 18:10:44 #SaudiArabia is now so powerful it could do just anything & get away with it. #Canada scared to react publicly to #Kashoggi murder. US unwilling to react bcos of $1.5b biz deal, and the rest of the world? Oil. #Power #Diplomacy #KashoggiMurder
2819 2018-10-21 18:10:25 Sorry, but if you believe this video you need a class in Fake News detection.

Please remove this trash. We don't need more oil on the fire. 

Reported.
2820 2018-10-21 18:10:22 I agree with you on all but 112. The new setback rules would not only be detrimental to the oil & gas industry in Colorado but also to many of the farmers like me who are dependent upon O&G revenue to hold onto our farms in this time of tanking commodity prices (thanks Trump)
2821 2018-10-21 18:10:18 I brought my car to get a oil change...
Man: what kind of oil?
Me: uhhh idk let me call my dad  why did i agree to do it lol
2822 2018-10-21 18:10:09 everyone should know how to do an oil change on their car.  Instead of spending money on oil changes & labor, use the money to get the tools you need to change your oil & then the only future cost you have is the oil

2825 2018-10-21 18:10:05 The important fact is that *somebody* has to be the enemy in a kleptocracy. Europe/Canada/Mexico/S. America all too weak, too small, too allied, or too many Americans take vacations there. Mid east has oil. Russia, ha ha. China is left.
2826 2018-10-21 18:10:04 You betcha bud!  And those messes are the result of decades of Republican Governors/Mayor and their terrible planning skills. Owned by Big Oil!

Big Oil got LA to rip out the electric streetcar system!

2828 2018-10-21 18:09:57 Oil cartels like traffic. Sometimes I even think they bribe police to ensure long qeues on the roads because sometimes police make you wait for an hour for no reason.
2829 2018-10-21 18:09:42 The Koch family fortune was made in part by building the 3rd largest oil refinery in Nazi Germany, an important part of their war machine. The kochs control the Republican Party, so I guess the @GOP is #controlledbynazigold
2830 2018-10-21 18:09:36 The US only gets 5% of it's oil from them, and we're looking for alternative methods of obtaining, so we'll soon have little reason to support them over that as well.

I wouldn't hastily burn every bridge just yet, but I'd stop giving them weapons if I were in the Oval Office.
2831 2018-10-21 18:09:32 Cover in coconut oil and leave for 30 mins or all night if u can then rinse and wash. You can also add oil to your hair everyday there's a few different kinds that help

2835 2018-10-21 18:09:18 Comrade President, with all due respect more regulation is NOT what is required in Zimbabwe. Government has regulated for a long long time prize of maize,  cooking oil, foreign exchange rates...  am sure the results speak for them selves....
2836 2018-10-21 18:09:08 i only wear mascara/blush on a regular basis but i have a milk tinted lip oil that i wear often and i like tony moly products bc theyre sooo adorable (i like their pokemon stuff!) also etude house has cute eyeshadow palettes (i have the juice bar one!)

2838 2018-10-21 18:09:05 Why does Lucas Oil Stadium smell like sweat and sunscreen
2839 2018-10-21 18:08:54 ได้คำตอบแล้วนะ เขาไม่ได้รักมาก แต่ก็ทุกวัน รักมากไปมันน่าเบื่อ
2840 2018-10-21 18:08:39 Plays on a lot of fears. Not for hearts of parents. Yet, compelling.
2841 2018-10-21 18:08:19 The point you missed there is we're not giving it to them, they pay for it with money we paid them for oil. The #money is the motive for #TyrantTrump , not morality or justice. #TyrantTrump thinks only in terms of #CashValue .
2842 2018-10-21 18:08:17 My hole....sweet and sour congealed stick muck is banned from my gaff. Curry with a splash of dark soy and some chili oil 
2843 2018-10-21 18:07:53 It’s additive no? All of it should names and shamed. Oil barrels are of less importance - commodities don’t have flags as you know Brett
2844 2018-10-21 18:07:38 Enjoy the beer!  ps how is Lucas oil itself? Always looked like one of my favorite stadiums. Would look nice in BUF, IMO.
2845 2018-10-21 18:07:32 i’ve come to the conclusion that tea tree oil is good for acne and now my skin has been clearing up 
2846 2018-10-21 18:07:27 Never thought they were friends of the west.  Is it because of oil and great wealth that they are allowed to control and run the world?  Because they do!!!
2847 2018-10-21 18:07:23 So selling armoured vehicles to #SaudiArabia is bad, but buying $2 billion worth of oil from these thugs is good. You fucking morons. #cdnpoli
2848 2018-10-21 18:06:54 That would just drive up oil costs. In the long run, Saudi Arabia would be the winner. Other types of sanctions, or air-strikes, are a better option
2849 2018-10-21 18:06:49 Give the breasts a little bash then flash fry them in a little oil and butter. Mini fillet steaks. The best way - Delish!
2850 2018-10-21 18:06:32 Present evidence that any mainstream Dem holds all of those value true. Most of those rely on candidates dropping massive insurance, pharma, oil, prison, bank, etc. sponsorships so they can call them out. You really think they'd do that when they get hundreds of millions?
2851 2018-10-21 18:06:28 broooo fuck cermak my car is so dirty and that shit won’t come off. How do you take off oil stains from a car guys 
2852 2018-10-21 18:06:28 Lucas Oil Stadium is a very quiet stadium #GoBills #Colts
2853 2018-10-21 18:06:26 Also for cheap cooking oil
2854 2018-10-21 18:06:18 C O N S E Q U E N C E S. 
You should never face the consequences because you are oil rich?
You wish for most favoured nation treatment?

2855 2018-10-21 18:06:15 Shale oil... reduced demand for 'traditional' producers like Nigeria.
2856 2018-10-21 18:06:06 No not silly. I have the massage oil I just get stuck when ordering the essential oils that people love. I hate wading through websites of nonsense. I use them because they smell nice 
2857 2018-10-21 18:05:57 Corporate shills would rather back $$$$ for OIL than human lives. Go figure.

2860 2018-10-21 18:05:32 With oil and garri
I can make JOLLOF RICE.
2861 2018-10-21 18:05:21 Programming is like painting. It doesn't matter if you are using oil or water colours. What matters is if you are making a masterpiece or just some doodles.
2862 2018-10-21 18:05:19 The Saudis will not mess with their oil deal rates as they are reliant on it. 
And the President is just trying to beat Obama's record numbers of Arm sales. He's not thinking about the country. The country is fine.
2863 2018-10-21 18:05:16 There are so many oil providers. Actually USA doesn't buy that much of Saudi oil.
2864 2018-10-21 18:05:07 RT @LivingSafely: Brominated vegetable oil ("BVO") in your sodas this October? This flame retardant can be used to prevent separation.

2867 2018-10-21 18:04:59 I use my face cleanser first, then apply the tea tree oil, rub it in. I’ve been doing it twice a day.
2868 2018-10-21 18:04:46 Oil and opposition to Iran is why most of the West will demand but a wrist-slap as a response to the murder. Never forget that what develops during the coming weeks  will have more to do with realpolitik, not morality.
2869 2018-10-21 18:04:40 I'm jerking off to our nation's first lady right about now!  Let me find my baby oil bottle first.
2870 2018-10-21 18:04:35 Olbas oil in hand ... here we go ... feeling better already.. bestest medicine ever you guys the tweetalong & our beloved serial  #thearchers @BBCTheArchers
2871 2018-10-21 18:04:29 They said in the post they would use the oil rig as a control centre for smaller enclave bases already established like the bunker under the greenbrier
2872 2018-10-21 18:04:21 The World changed because of OIL's application, ENERGY, money and politics have sent the world to the brink of war and countries competing for access to grow their economic interests. Solar energy is the most effective way to change directions and clean the air
2873 2018-10-21 18:04:20 Seriously, how many people do I reach on Twitter who haven't tried CBD oil
2874 2018-10-21 18:03:58 Go drink some sesame oil
2875 2018-10-21 18:03:51 @checkupcbc Complex hydrocarbons are incredibly valuable. Canadians own lots but our leaders selling it to multinationals for peanuts. Oil appreciates in the ground.
2876 2018-10-21 18:03:44 Since becoming the world's top oil producer on the back of junk bonds, the US has effectively stifled competition from Venezuela and Iran. Coming next: Saudi Arabia, and finally, Russia.
2877 2018-10-21 18:03:40 @checkupcbc Oil wells last about 12 years. Charging multinationals much more for Canadian oil for new wells or projects will mean supply will gradually decrease over 12 years as wells deplete.
2878 2018-10-21 18:03:39 Go and buy castor oil and be rubbing it into your scalp.
2879 2018-10-21 18:03:31 @narendramodi @AmitShah @AmitShahOffice @dpradhanbjp India must stay in touch with US authorities o'er leveraging recent incidents involving KSA to bring down crude oil prices. 1/2
2880 2018-10-21 18:03:21 So this is how they reward for loyalty by stabbing him in the back. Wow! What a discordant party of liars indeed.
2881 2018-10-21 18:03:20 Nah iya aku jg sampe skrg masih pake extraordinary oil nya. Terutama jgn nyisir pas kondisi rambut basah. Makasi udh nambahin hehehehe
2882 2018-10-21 18:03:20 Whale Oil Beef Hooked !
2883 2018-10-21 18:03:19 @checkupcbc  The price we pay? Instead Canadians should change more for the oil we own. Announce a gradual but significant increase in the price of oil over the next year to allow exploration companies time to wind down.
2884 2018-10-21 18:03:05 Nothing wrong with both...let’s oil up then shower it off! 
2885 2018-10-21 18:03:04 @checkupcbc Why phrase the question as a price to pay? Start charging more for the oil at the wellhead or tarsands. Demand drops. Renewables  increase. Climate change mitigates.
2886 2018-10-21 18:03:03 I was always taught to just cook and taste hah. But let me see if I can write it out:
Heat up tbs oil and cook chicken tenderloins about 3 min each side. Set aside. Cut up broccoli into small pieces and put in pan with tbs oil, carrots and snap peas. Stir constantly.
2887 2018-10-21 18:02:58 Last I checked, we did all live on #OneWorld and we should be taking care of it. Not bowing to the almighty dollar and OIL. #StopFracking
2888 2018-10-21 18:02:55 Its 2 PM and we are about to break 40° and I'm kinda into it. Except I can't afford oil so I'm without my monitor heat and relying on 2 electric heaters.

2894 2018-10-21 18:02:39 Our test lab gets over 500psig, and they have trouble keeping tubing on fittings/from bursting. They use oil and hydraulic valves, though. Less contained energy when something lets go.
2895 2018-10-21 18:02:37 1/ Yes, inflation has trapped many ppl!  I grew up when prices were stable. In 1970 Nixon took us off the gold standard & tied the dollar to the price of oil.  Ever since then, inflation has run wild, keeping everyone down except the very wealthy— as, apparently, was intended.
2896 2018-10-21 18:02:30 Its good you confess Saudis have no value but cheap oil! Thank you!
2897 2018-10-21 18:02:30 Higher gas prices= more electric car purchases = oil prices will go down again.
2898 2018-10-21 18:02:28 Russia has been laundering Iranian oil onto world markets for years. Nothing new.
2899 2018-10-21 18:02:25 If not mistaken, that was on the 27th of September 2018. After Gakaka between 60-65km peg towards Zvishavane from Shurugwi. Pakaita loss apo, both Gold (cooking oil) and vehicle.
2900 2018-10-21 18:02:24 The  world is ruled by oil,gas and money people please understand that no world leader wants to admit the truth we need those who are evil because they provide us gas,oil and money #Khashoggi #mh17 #Palestina dont expect change they know...time will heal all wounds
2901 2018-10-21 18:02:12 That’s what all us antifacsist, antiracist punks were yelling at shows in the 90’s instead of “Oi! Oi! Oi!”.

Which looks like “oil oil oil” if you squint. Maybe the other dudes were ancaps? 

I need to go lie down.
2902 2018-10-21 18:02:10 At what point do we realize the Saudis are no better than the Iranians or North Koreans for that matter. They are enemies of the west, whose values are completely antithetical to ours. Screw their oil and screw them.

2905 2018-10-21 18:02:00 Probably would. But refineries aren't especially profitable so needs govt involvement. In SA's case, we need to import fuel or oil regardless, as we don't produce much oil/gas (outside Sasol's coal to liquids, & Mossgas's tiny contribution. .

2908 2018-10-21 18:01:05 Japan was oil starved and the Malaysia was seen as a oil provider and the conquest of Asia was deemed necessary . Germany saw Russia a diverse energy asset and fought WWII to gain them. The United States with domestic oil supplies was the equivalent of the Middle East before 1937

2910 2018-10-21 18:01:04 I love your feed and I get and share your anger. But re your question: Simply because Trump says loudly what has been us policy towards saudi arabia for decades. Accepting human rights violations cause saudis sell oil and buy weapons. Sad and simple.

2913 2018-10-21 18:00:41 Rather a hypocritical statement...yet we continue to sell them arms, armoured vehicles and buy their oil!  Stop these transactions then maybe someone will take you seriously!

2915 2018-10-21 18:00:37 We've got millions of gallons of any currency we want in the those oil fields that didn't exist according to the UK government in 2014, and that's just the icing on the cake when we aren't paying for all England's infrastructure, like the last fifty years.

2936 2018-10-21 17:58:35 Why dont we stop selling them arms then? Only 15 billion..or perhaps stop buying oil from them.

2943 2018-10-21 17:57:33 Yes but my query is...is it “cleaner” to use our own oil or at very least does not cause any more pollution that getting oil from Saudi Arabia? Are there any studies? Or is it just everyone talkingnout their ass?
2944 2018-10-21 17:57:29 Still see a lot of 18 jerseys at Lucas Oil. #BUFvsIND

2946 2018-10-21 17:57:18 They probably look for oil while there at it
2947 2018-10-21 17:57:15 The Middle East was not OIL rich until/after 1937 when vast stores of oil were discovered when actually looking for WATER.  7 International companies took over the mechanism of discovery and refinement and the Middle East was changed into  OIL NATIONS

Or

2969 2018-10-21 17:54:45 MILK IS FUCKING $3.20 MY NIGGA A MONTH AGO IT WAS 1.20, GAS PRICES ARE FUCKING INSANE, yeahhh it’s good to make everything in America and yeah that does mean we have to TAX farmers and foreign countries who bring in oil and gas TO THE MAXIMUM
2970 2018-10-21 17:54:44 It’s filled with Palm Oil, so it practically is

2971 2018-10-21 17:54:42 “Retrieve”? The Times story was breathtakingly chilling today. Big brother’s got oil money to burn...
2972 2018-10-21 17:54:41 @thegamechasers "oil up and hit the gym with me" Man i'm watching old episodes of the game chasers to night. That line made me laugh so hard haha.
2973 2018-10-21 17:54:40 Lucas Oil Stadium needs to get louder! Come on #ColtsNation!
2974 2018-10-21 17:54:30 Why doesn't this oven cook my Yorkshires properly. They went into hot oil and have been in half and hour and just just seem to be rising and are still quite pale.  This is the second time this has happened. Ruining my Yorkshire pud game.
2975 2018-10-21 17:54:26 No, Ted Cruz is fake . and he is bilingual but he is not proud of being Cuban descendant . That is why he changed his name . and Beto O'Rourke is honest ,Ted Cruz is not. Ted Cruz is a yes man , he is own by the oil men of Texas . 
2976 2018-10-21 17:54:16 Can u tell me as a loyal customer about this PALM OIL issue?. Until I get the truth I will no longer purchase your products.
2977 2018-10-21 17:53:59 33But a certain Sa·marʹi·tan traveling the road came upon him, and at seeing him, he was moved with pity.34So he approached him and bandaged his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them. Then he mounted him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him.
2978 2018-10-21 17:53:46 Poor Mrs. D had to clean up the damn Valdez oil spill
2979 2018-10-21 17:53:42 Ya girl finally came to get her oil changed 
2980 2018-10-21 17:53:41 I mean, has anyone even asked her to? Because I'm turning down any Super Bowl ads too. For reasons. 

Actually no. I could use the cash.
2981 2018-10-21 17:53:25 Otis Redding how did you know.  His stuff and Aretha's was go to music in Africa in 70's.  Loved it. I am missing My Gal she has gone to the farm with my youngest darling granddaughter.  They will be back soon and stocked full of tales ... ...I don't like it when they travel x
2982 2018-10-21 17:53:20 Millions of years in the making, OIL, does not replenish itself overnight. Use of it as a fuel is wasteful.  Its energy quotient and transportability that has made it attractive and available for its use patterns. Newer technology is not a option for its replacement, it is coming
2983 2018-10-21 17:53:20 Just pull out all my lash extensions Im finna soak my lashes in castor oil till ASA weekend
2984 2018-10-21 17:53:14 And he doesn't care if your family came 150 years ago or you crawled over a border fence 4 days ago.
Open borders Joe
2985 2018-10-21 17:52:59 As you might well know, the problem that arises in the world is, if the USA acts, we’re imperialist or “just in it for the oil.” If we don’t act we are isolationist and “ignoring our global responsibilities.” There is no winning in this scenario.
2986 2018-10-21 17:52:58 I just love how the world is arguing here about ‘Saudi oil’ with the Russian or Iranian bots etc. Allies aren’t always the ones that throw money and fuck the planet. WWJD?
2987 2018-10-21 17:52:39 I really want to try @Nap85’s twist-elongating style cream but it has sesame seed oil in it. I’m so hurt lol

2990 2018-10-21 17:52:13 THANK FOR OIL LYBIA
زهرة بيضاء هي الألغام!
2991 2018-10-21 17:51:56 How could you possibly enjoy soggy oil drenched plantain. Disgusting
2992 2018-10-21 17:51:49 And a few barrels of oil
2993 2018-10-21 17:51:40 Old mud being raked up, Kelloggs have worked hard since 2016 and are well on course to full accreditation by 2020.  Even the WWF give them a score of 9 out of 9 for their Palm Oil program.  However if they still get slagged off, they might as well purchase cheaper Palm Oil.
2994 2018-10-21 17:51:37 Last night Tauheed got essential oil poisoning from just sniffing the fuck out of an incense candle that was at his level. He is alright now but it was fucking terrifying.
2995 2018-10-21 17:51:36 Awww, it hurts to see an abused VR6 engine, especially a 24 valve. But they aren’t a Toyota or Honda. Gotta stay religious about oil changes and good quality oil. 
2996 2018-10-21 17:51:29 Oil is oil no? Clean renewable energy should be the focus.
2997 2018-10-21 17:50:52 Adding oil will like that then you can considered to pour your hard work which let your paper shining with your answer 
2998 2018-10-21 17:50:49 Can't watch the review in Lucas Oil Stadium, gotta watch the cheerleader routine. #Priorities
2999 2018-10-21 17:50:28 Let's talk about employment! This Government inherited a disaster. What did it do to weather the storm? It didn't retrench workers. Instead, it even helped states to keep its workers by bailing the states out twice...despite low earnings in oil.
3000 2018-10-21 17:50:11 Put some custard oil on your knee.  It will help to heal it quickly my love. Take care
3001 2018-10-21 17:50:02 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
3002 2018-10-21 17:49:57 Solar Energy is clean and economical.Pakistan lies in the region where we have world high insolation rate. BY installing solar sytem we can protect our Environment as well as reduce oil import and save carbon footprints. 
We have to promote Renewable Energy.

3003 2018-10-21 17:49:37 Hey, if hadn't been for the "Yes on 112" campaign the oil and gas industry would not have been able to provide all the jobs for canvassers, advertisers, sign makers, etc in opposition!

So, we are "job creators" after all! — feeling entertained
3004 2018-10-21 17:49:27 Now let’s talk oil and soft wood lumber.
3005 2018-10-21 17:49:20 Business will always find a way to oil the wheels, especially in the case of the UK leaving the EU, we are their biggest member customer with a huge deficit with the EU. It is in everybody's interest to make business easy, especially the EU as we eradicate tariffs from elsewhere.
3006 2018-10-21 17:49:19 I've been watching a ton of cooking shows lately and competitors are always like "I'm puttin some TRUFFLE oil out here to kick it up a notch" and EVERY TIME the judges eliminate them for too much goddamn truffle oil
3007 2018-10-21 17:49:14 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
3008 2018-10-21 17:49:09 The problem with the world is that we're all competing against one another, rather than working together, whether it be space exploration, hunger/drought, disease curing-discoveries or basic economic requirements for individual states (oil, energy needs).
3009 2018-10-21 17:48:59 I just wanted to show that oil prices are expensive everywhere else in the world. Showing average income still wouldn’t show you what percentage of their incomes go to transportation. Cost of living is also high in countries with high average incomes.
3010 2018-10-21 17:48:54 That thunder snatch my edges wii. Hadda buy castor oil tmrw
3011 2018-10-21 17:48:44 Buy coconut oil
3012 2018-10-21 17:48:22 Thank you darling! So fucking many I spent over £150 on products once I first started. Once back on insta I will do some vlog type posts about what I use, but my go to products are the Shea moisture Jamaican caster oil range - particularly the treatment and the leave in condish
3013 2018-10-21 17:48:14 This form would not be available to your backyard or house top as solar energy producer,  but photovoltaic panels of monolithic design could be. This technology would improve as time evolved and collateral products would emerge, oil could be saved for future use.
3014 2018-10-21 17:48:02 The phrasing of the headline makes it seems like the ads she is turning down are pro-Kaepernick
3015 2018-10-21 17:48:02 What did you expect? Gibraltar doesn't have oil.
3016 2018-10-21 17:47:59 No it means they are panic buying because they are poor, they buy so little then quickly run out. Assume they only have 1 bottle, it will likely run out in a week and by then if there is no cooking oil in shops it means trouble. Hence they must curb that buy buying in advance.
3017 2018-10-21 17:47:55 An accident where someone was carrying a lot of c/oil???
3018 2018-10-21 17:47:42 Comment from white house is just a smoke screen and tick box exercise. US produced oil is used for commercial air industry. The one from the middle east is for ground travel. US is very complex nation man. However we cannot expect them to police everyone. Our leaders are sellouts
3019 2018-10-21 17:47:30 Who tf makes popcorn using expired coconut oil 
3020 2018-10-21 17:47:26 Unlike fishes, which start to rot quickly - the more you draw out the culling and cutting process of humans - the more you can extract in the equivalent form of fish-blood/flavour/oil - money. Its all driven by money and some ego massage for megalomaniacs.
3021 2018-10-21 17:47:19 tea tree oil literally works magic on my skin
3022 2018-10-21 17:47:14 I keep forgetting I need an oil change  I just keep driving and driving and then remembering like oh shit  was supposed to do that like a week ago...
3023 2018-10-21 17:47:12 psa if your feet are fucked up from hoco; take castor oil & lather that shit alllll over ya feet, then put on some thick socks & any blisters, cuts, etc. will be gone in a day or two
3024 2018-10-21 17:47:11 ahh same, but I used this rip off bio oil in hopes it’d do something but nope lol
3025 2018-10-21 17:47:03 Not very advanced though Di, which is the crux of the matter, a spot light has been shined, when we dont need Saudi oil, then the fun will really begin, thats when the proverbial will hit the fan, I hope they have plenty of contracts to keep the west quiet on its shenanigans.
3026 2018-10-21 17:46:52 i cast oil your godbert
3027 2018-10-21 17:46:41 Mo Bamba at Lucas oil stadium?!?!?! Feed me.
3028 2018-10-21 17:46:35 That's how I see it anyways, but I respect your view. The Military Industrial complex appears to have alot of influence in politics, and vested interests (arms dealing and oil grabbing) are put before the safety of civilians, especially if they are brown or black civilians. :/
3029 2018-10-21 17:46:29 Lol. His stuff is minor and set to rattle the real monsters. Best to keep ppl thinking u stupid and make change in private. Forget opinion. Do homework into following stocks and strictly geopolitics. Then follow the ties of oil and money/ benefit of past presidencies/corporations
3030 2018-10-21 17:46:20 U cannot compare it with other countries bcoz it depends on relation with countries who provide Oil and petrol.
3031 2018-10-21 17:46:16 Mixing oil and water
3032 2018-10-21 17:46:16 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.
3033 2018-10-21 17:46:10 The population of China is 4.25 x that of the US and they only produce 2x the carbon emissions we do.  Are they supposed to stop building a modern infrastructure?
They'd have to cut carbon emissions by 90%  build all new infrastructure, and do it cheaper than oil, gas, coal.
3034 2018-10-21 17:46:07 Check your Transmission oil today.
3035 2018-10-21 17:46:06 Lol but he was grabbing the person closest to him. Melo and Gordon grabbed Ingram. At the end of the day rondo is a coworker and Chris oil is the god father of his kids
3036 2018-10-21 17:46:02 When the Saudi's say we will cut off your oil supply unless you turn over the Shiites or Jews in America - do you still make the same case? What is the ballpark dollar price of a person now for the @GOP? The only thing that is FAKE is your morality and tough guy persona.
3037 2018-10-21 17:45:48 They have tons of money, and can wreck the world's economy with their oil production/supply. 
AND, they are somehow seen as a balance to Iran's influence.
Make oil a marginal energy source, and minor commodity,  and they can be ignored.
3038 2018-10-21 17:45:48 IMO, I think he answered the first question and he did so brilliantly, he recognized that his government is still highly reliant on foreign oil companies and he stated why they investing in us. Then he said this caused him to push a fight against corruption so that our source...
3039 2018-10-21 17:45:47 Ode see gold you hit, babe dea bring out crude oil you're complaining!!

3042 2018-10-21 17:45:24 Can you list which good quality household stuff is made in pakistan. 
E.g.
Cereals for breakfast.
 shampoo 
Soap
Detergents. 
Electrical stuff.
Oil gee...
Etc
3043 2018-10-21 17:45:13 Just want an argument eh? Other Provinces don't have mountains, oil, wheat fields, retail pot stores, private liquor stores etc. Now as to Alberta's education funding. Private NPO schools get around 30% of the funding public gets. Some public schools do choose students, facts.
3044 2018-10-21 17:45:12 Hmu if you need you car undercoated with oil to prevent rust and wear this winter season.
3045 2018-10-21 17:45:03 This oil merchants think whole world is fucking dumb. Lol.
3046 2018-10-21 17:45:03 Ingredient Watch: Brominated vegetable oil ("BVO") in your sodas this October? This flame retardant can be used to prevent separation.
3047 2018-10-21 17:44:55 S/O to the guy who gave us edibles, oil and a joint. I love Vegas
3048 2018-10-21 17:44:53 We as people have become hugely reliant on oil. maybe our thinking should of changed many years ago on who supplied us with it.
3049 2018-10-21 17:44:53 The Poseidon oil rig was the enclave’s main base of operations and apparently they have a secret base in Appalachia. I am 100% being part of them unless something like the railroad comes along (doubtful) and in that case I’ll be a bit of both

3051 2018-10-21 17:44:40 You show em! Show them how we condemn them through a strongly worded tweet! Bet they are shaking in their boots. Have you told Trudeau to stop buying their oil? How about stopping the sale of military equipment?
3052 2018-10-21 17:44:23 38 years after independence with more than 10 universities, Zimbabweans cannot have a competitive company than can produce fish oil.(Cooking oil). Primary kids in other nations are producing cellphones. Can we discuss a Briton what what here
3053 2018-10-21 17:44:21 The book will done if he put it on fire. He shu add knorr chicken to be precised... Small curry and plenty palm oil.

3057 2018-10-21 17:44:05 You think we'd need the oil money? A debt free United can more than match any club. No handouts needed. As for hypocrites, City fans moaned about United's spending for decades, DECADES!!! Then shut up when the Sheikh started spending.
3058 2018-10-21 17:44:00 @tarkarestaurant Hey guys, what kind of oil do you use for your kebabs?
3059 2018-10-21 17:43:34 I forgot this chick spilled oil on my 3s smh
3060 2018-10-21 17:43:34 Lucas Oil Library erupts after that TD #Bills
3061 2018-10-21 17:43:29 every morning I undergo a process of anamnesis wherein I must remember anew each day that the Democratic party performs three functions:

- gatekeeping discourse to protect capital, especially oil interests

- intentionally losing

- maintaining the illusion that elections matter
3062 2018-10-21 17:43:25 He simply says that the oil companies have been in Nigeria for over 40 yrs and that they see the prospects that's why keep investing.
Our duty is to secure the environ ment. How is that the corruption @MBuhari saw ?
3063 2018-10-21 17:43:22 Jada is a  transit police that likes Mustard oil on their chili peppers pizza with rum

3065 2018-10-21 17:43:17 Venezuela’s whole economy & government was based on OIL. You can NOT compare that to the US. It’s like comparing apples & kumquats. Trumps hand out to farmers is SOCIALIST. Check reliable news sources they’ll tell you.
3066 2018-10-21 17:43:15 The first pic shows cooking oil from an accident scene.
3067 2018-10-21 17:43:11 The  9/11 attacks allowed the US to make fracking—a very unpopular thing at the time—militarily important. It was prioritized. This has made trillions (I’m guessing) for the Republicans and Russians who have the monopoly on the US gas and oil industry and related real estate.
3068 2018-10-21 17:43:07 without oil you condemn millions of ppl to slow death
3069 2018-10-21 17:42:59 garlic infused olive oil is everything i dream of
3070 2018-10-21 17:42:48 Ya right. Stop buying Saudi oil. That would be courageous.
3071 2018-10-21 17:42:43 If the US withdraws support from Saudi regime, they will have to install a new regime who also agree to sell oil only in USD & rollover petrodollars into US weapons systems, US stocks & treasuries. Otherwise, the USD as world reserve currency is in serious trouble
3072 2018-10-21 17:42:41 Nah man the olive oil is where it‘s really at for them. I have yet to eat an Italian dish without at least a drizzle of olive oil on it.
3073 2018-10-21 17:42:33 Colts score a touchdown. Streamers are falling from the ceiling of Lucas Oil Stadium. I’m assuming that means this game is over.
3074 2018-10-21 17:42:11 I suppose vegans can always supplement with olive oil and avocado mush.
3075 2018-10-21 17:41:58 Read this as wax/oil
3076 2018-10-21 17:41:56 As the world moves away from oil, your country will become increasingly irrelevant. Until someone makes a car that can run on sand or human rights abuse you will serve no purpose on the world stage.
3077 2018-10-21 17:41:43 Since 1900, it is a constant argument that all wars have been fought over energy, chiefly oil, gas or coal. The under lying reason being Money and economic development is fueled by access to these resources. Solar energy would dramatically change this contest & conflict
3078 2018-10-21 17:41:24 U don dey work for oil company
3079 2018-10-21 17:41:18 Why don't you mention how the dollar is tied to oil- the Petro dollar- and how Russia and China would LOVE for the US to drop Saudi oil so the dollar would no longer be the world's defacto currency. Loss of the empire tax would cause the US to crash with its 21 trillion debt
3080 2018-10-21 17:41:16 Just used the juices from the pork, little bit of olive oil...  
3081 2018-10-21 17:41:11 Whos got the time to put all that emoji in a caption? 
3082 2018-10-21 17:41:08 @lieschenv This is a small but poignant example of the j-c capitalist marketplace "just doing a good job" (i.e., payment from an authoritarian kingdom) but having "no idea" that their info would be used to harm others (just like: tobacco firms, asbestos mines, oil companies,etc).
3083 2018-10-21 17:40:59 Comparing the world's largest oil producer with an insolvent basket case wannabe North Korea is intellectual laziness. It's all about what a country brings to the table, every American President visits the Saudis, have you ever seen a seating US President in Harare?
3084 2018-10-21 17:40:47 No worries, we have 1 main customer the USA, pay us allot less then market. Eastern Canada buying oil from terrorist states, like Saudi the masterminds begins 911, chopping heads off, no rights for woman and migrant workers. It’s all about $, we talk a big game about rights.
3085 2018-10-21 17:40:44 Well, two of his own states already banned open-loop scrubbers in favour of the ultralow sulphur fuel which should have been made mandatory worldwide instead of all this nonsense about making shipowners pay millions to clean the oil companies’ dirty product.

3087 2018-10-21 17:40:34 Yet we're still at the top for per-capita pollution. Fracking doesn't just pollute the air. It leeches heavy metals into the soil and groundwater. It destabilizes bedrock. It has a much higher propensity of blowing up than oil. So yes, we can be an opponent of both.
3088 2018-10-21 17:40:30 You can’t sow division and discord either wise. That’s his driving force and if you observe the people at his rallies, he is successful thanks to his lies. He is a snake oil salesman.
3089 2018-10-21 17:40:28 Cut out the "without palm oil" and you're still spot on.
3090 2018-10-21 17:40:20 Real barn-burner today in the Oil Drum. This game gets any more exciting I may have to break out the No-Doz...#yawn

@JosephWalker3
3095 2018-10-21 17:39:57 Don't be ridiculous   Liberals in EU are undermining themselves. Merkel keeping Putin's coffers full by buying his oil.  European still trying to do the stupid Kerry deal with Iran. Countless other idiotic moves like weak on immigration destroying their culture. #Wakeup
3096 2018-10-21 17:39:56 I don't think the sanctions hurt Iran one bit.  Iran has had sanctions of one kind or another against them since 1979.  They have learned to work around them.  They sell  their oil on the black market at a discount.  It won't effect supply.
3097 2018-10-21 17:39:53 Palm oil is hardly essential, so many items are fine without them. Usustainable palm oil is simply a cheap alternative that big Multinational corporations use to cut costs. It needs to end, Take a stand #DontFundExtinction
3098 2018-10-21 17:39:50 ...And all oil purchases from Saudi. Money talks.

3101 2018-10-21 17:39:39 Ya juj wa ma juj
3102 2018-10-21 17:39:34 It's a cooking oil factory
3103 2018-10-21 17:39:33 Cool and fun life hack: 

Don't wear a crop top while cooking with hot oil.
3104 2018-10-21 17:39:33 Canadaland looks at MJ coverage as more reporters are hired to write about this new investment opportunity like it's oil or any other commodity except it's not. Booze and smoking isn't covered extensively to whip up desire to use the product.
3105 2018-10-21 17:39:25 You can tell now that their defense contracts are touted more than their oil as an indicator that their power is on the wane.
3106 2018-10-21 17:39:24 cause once you speak, bs reek like oil leak

3111 2018-10-21 17:39:03 The #HouseOfSaud was installed by the British to serve western interests, The Saudis agreed to sell their oil ONLY in US$ & rollover the billions of petrodollars into US weapons systems & US stocks. This underpins the dollar as world reserve currency.
3112 2018-10-21 17:39:02 ima change my own oil to my car if it breaks fuck it
3113 2018-10-21 17:39:00 I know you don’t oil down that ashy ass neck either
3114 2018-10-21 17:38:57 I'd definitely put good salt in (seasalt or Himalayan pink, my favourite). A layer of cheese on top might help. Fat carries flavour so it may be fat/oil light too
3115 2018-10-21 17:38:57 It’s weed oil.
3116 2018-10-21 17:38:40 There should be two top division leagues from now on. One for the oil bags and other for us normal clubs.
3117 2018-10-21 17:38:35 That is what the big corps want. 
Insurance
Pharmaceuticals
Oil & Gas
Mining
Monsanto
Kochs
Mercers
Devros

etc etc
3118 2018-10-21 17:38:25 The nite is as dark as my soul &amp; as in my apartment. My apartment is also dark b/c I ran out of lamp oil. My soul is also out of lamp oil.
3119 2018-10-21 17:38:16 it says on that page that our neighbor counties (6) are banning fracking...GOOD and limiting oil production...GOOD.not outlawing Oil production...TOO FAR....
3120 2018-10-21 17:38:12 One incident from pakistan in which fifty plus people were on road for collecting oil and one man was smoking there. we all know that what happened there after the man threw the fire on oily road.

Same case here repeated by the organiser, No fault of crowd it's human nature.
3121 2018-10-21 17:37:54 One day ima find somebody who appreciates this coconut oil covered chocolate 
3122 2018-10-21 17:37:48 Can't we invest more in our refineries to benefit African producers and then leverage that against the high costs we face as an oil importer.Would that not benefit this economy in the long run?
3123 2018-10-21 17:37:44 Just gave my 9 year old lab with sore joints his first dose of CBD oil. I've got the rice krispie treats ready for him. #Ricekrispies #CBDoil
3124 2018-10-21 17:37:43 I am not owner of oil Refineries they are Govt of India properties but Ahmeds who have control over Iran sends Crude oil to where ever I stay Because Hameeda was Daughter of Ahmeds...
3125 2018-10-21 17:37:42 How does a steak taste if cooked with truffle oil? we bout to see TA-DAY!
3126 2018-10-21 17:37:26 Gold diggers keep digging Y’all gone strike Oil in a min
3127 2018-10-21 17:37:14 Потому что, мальчик спавший на уроках, между СССР и Германией действовал договор о ненападении. Идиот)) Узнай лучше как компании США, например, Форд, Standard Oil оказывали помощь Германии после объявления Германией войны США в 1941 году. Твою дивизию, какие вы все-таки рагули)
3128 2018-10-21 17:37:12 I’m struck by how news items are treated as discrete events, as if nothing affects anything else. The recent UN report on the environment is an obvious one (oil, anyone?) This is another. The juxtaposition of horrific news about Yemen & Trump’s excuse about selling weapons to SA.
3129 2018-10-21 17:37:09 Any girl that is reading this. You probably need an oil change
3130 2018-10-21 17:37:04 Send me some sweet soul music please
3131 2018-10-21 17:37:03 it IS sick as FUCK!

how is that NOT enough?

why can we NOT go with THAT?

West is NOT trying to exterminate you
West is trying to get the best deal on oil they can, which does not even necessitate killing 3 million in 3 years, only 10's of thousands
from a population of 70 mill
3132 2018-10-21 17:36:58 I believe that has a part to play as the riper plantain gets the softer the texture but frying in low temp oil exacerbates it
3133 2018-10-21 17:36:46 The Saudis do not fly around the globe, begging bowl in hand, looking for handouts so there is a false equivalence at the root of your post. None among the Western powers can tell them to f*ck off because they control the stability of oil prices, what does Zim control, scarfs?
3134 2018-10-21 17:36:26 Oh, hmm, maybe it wouldn't hurt to get an allergy test then. Or maybe it's a hair product you're using? I had to stop using hair products with coconut oil in them bc it would cause little whiteheads along my hair line.  But obviously all skin and people are different
3135 2018-10-21 17:36:18 But that was depressing, and I figured, if I'm indulging in pipe dreams, it ain't gonna be oil pipe dreams, so back to the summer camp fantasy!
3136 2018-10-21 17:36:17 Here's the bottom line - and this is science, not opinion. IPCC says we need to consume 87% less oil by 2050, or else global calamity. Discussion needs to be focused on *how* we achieve that, not *whether* to do so.
3137 2018-10-21 17:36:17 I laid my edges with Jamaican Black Castor Oil and they actually look bomb
3138 2018-10-21 17:36:03 Let's see... trap door ready, wall dart launchers ready, burning oil ready, electric coil ready... yes, I'm ready.
3139 2018-10-21 17:36:02 You could hear a pin drop at Lucas oil stadium today.
3140 2018-10-21 17:36:01 Best to change ingredients. Sustainable palm oil is a sustained lie.
3141 2018-10-21 17:35:59 Stealing their olives that just makes me sick! You better believe I will never ever eat an Olive from Israel!! Nor there olive oil not from Israel
3142 2018-10-21 17:35:56 Tell me how many paid lobbists are representing Saudi Arabia in Washington,DC? 
We have allowed this because of GREED.
YOU WANT TO HURT SAUDI ARABIA STOP THERE OIL PLACE AN embargo around all their ports. Show them we are not kidding around.
3143 2018-10-21 17:35:56 If Ed says no Chitty says no x  Chitty has perked up a bit x
3144 2018-10-21 17:35:50 it was a bit near the mark even for me.
flipping funny though
3145 2018-10-21 17:35:49 With Iran under sanctions most of US oil comes from Saudis plus US and UK sell them billions of dollars worth of arms and jets every year real Saudi sanctions would put real dents on those two economies
3146 2018-10-21 17:35:37 Tim,  that wouldn't be the consequence of a second vote - it's the existing consequence of a flawed, illegal, first vote where leave sold snake oil.

You've already opened Pandora's box, whether you realise it or not.
3147 2018-10-21 17:35:30 What noble sentiments! Not only Nourishing the World but also encouraging deforestation and helping to push endangered species to the brink of extinction. STOP USING UNSUSTAINABLE PALM OIL. We are watching you
3148 2018-10-21 17:35:17 In 1974, US President Ford meets Pres. Echeverria at the Arizona border to discuss economic development and recent oil discoveries.
3149 2018-10-21 17:35:15 Lol using that for ur lame pollution master canadian oil plant thats pretty lame..
3150 2018-10-21 17:35:04 Just one drop of the glistening oil can eventually stain even a soul as stalwart as a loxodon's beyond redemption.　《Loxodon Convert》[NPH]
3151 2018-10-21 17:35:03 Now that oil and money have run out, neocons will engineer a regime change of their unsavory Saudi partners in crime and "secure"  all the weapons they sold to them.
What a racket.  Anglo-zionist triumph = enslavement of the rest of the world.
3152 2018-10-21 17:34:54 هذا اللي كانت لابسه مرررررررررررره شورت ميبن،،،،؟؟ استغفروالله العظيم الله يعافينا ولا يبلانا
3153 2018-10-21 17:34:52 This question is not even worthy of Early Jeopardy Follow the Footprints IN THE OIL Hiding in PLAIN SIGHT
3154 2018-10-21 17:34:51 Sure. In the ideal world. But remember climate change? No point in expecting pipelines any time soon unless we go Russia. I'm thinking we're lucky to have trains to take the oil. Also folks going electric in terms of cars. I'm guessing oil is kaput. @OilGasCanada Find another sol
3155 2018-10-21 17:34:46 Guess who's to blame for them stealing the oil? Eisenhower.

When Egypt stole the Suez canal from a private firm Britain and France sent in paratroopers to beat back Egypt and they would have.

Eisenhower pressured them to come back. Middle East learned that the US is a wimp.
3156 2018-10-21 17:34:46 “If you ain't watching, you ain't winning.”

Snake oil salesman tactics.
3157 2018-10-21 17:34:42 Coconut oil has started solidifying. Winter is coming.
3158 2018-10-21 17:34:29 Pull yourself together girl, what's the matter.  Shoes pinching?
3159 2018-10-21 17:34:28 B. Gates “..putting a price on pollution that causes climate change will create a clear market signal ...” How will you price carbon pollution with Fairness to Oil&Gas industry without hurting it at the expense of renewables if it is not the only source of emissions
3160 2018-10-21 17:34:22 It's still political garbly-goop speak. Maybe policy like "we commit to bringing in a 5% PST while reducing income tax levels, while shifting all oil and gas revenue to the HTF for future generations."  That would be specific policy that would set the tone and direction of the AP
3161 2018-10-21 17:34:16 My moms bf has been saying he’ll do my oil change for over a month. I leave my car with him for a whole week and it never got done so i took my car back. Then he says he’ll do it today and hes stalling and laggin. Hes taking a shower!!!! Before an oil change!!!! Men aint shit fr.
3162 2018-10-21 17:34:06 Eddie said I shouldnt tweet it but it was rather blooming funny.
3163 2018-10-21 17:34:03 Or maybe because they have a lot of power because of Obama and they control the oil?
3164 2018-10-21 17:33:54 Oh, I follow it but what do you think Trump should do at this moment before the whole world knows the entire truth. If the Prince ordered it diplomacy with sanctions have to be put into place and strategically we have to be ready due to the impact it will have on oil prices.
3165 2018-10-21 17:33:48 Tax hike candidate. Vote for him if you want to pay more taxes (and if you want to see transnational oil companies like Shell pay less).
3166 2018-10-21 17:33:47 مابقى علينا غير المترديه والنطيحة والثيران والعبيد يتكلمون على اسيادهم اصحي يابقره الكويت وياسافرة قبل لاتدخلين في شؤن اسيادكم صلي استخارة هههههههههههههههه
3167 2018-10-21 17:33:41 Some people came to explore your life, if they don't discover oil, they'll definitely leave. 
Desire the best!
3168 2018-10-21 17:33:27 See, oil is actually good for the environment. Yeah, that’s the ticket.
3169 2018-10-21 17:33:27 And how quickly oil money would swamp me if I found an honest one.
3170 2018-10-21 17:33:25 you have the right to self-determination

oil IS yours

Christian West that colonized you & made you Christian IS using Muslims to keep you in Nigeria, so they can get the best deal on oil

there IS great suffering because of it

ALL of this is irrefutable fact
3171 2018-10-21 17:33:15 Zinc, selenium, fish oil, CoQ10, folic acid, vitamin c, magnesium,
3172 2018-10-21 17:33:01 one time i left a bottle of olive oil at maria's house so i went back to get it and i found her gently caressing the olive oil while crying
3173 2018-10-21 17:32:57 Bullshit. Trump wants the oil, that is all.
3174 2018-10-21 17:32:51 ฝันดีนะคะพี่สาว @iam_Oil
3175 2018-10-21 17:32:49 And people need to learn Venezuela was subject to their oil reserves and don't practice socialism as the there is a large private sector owning the resources. It only needs a bit of research to know this. But everyone keeps repeating the same stuff.
3176 2018-10-21 17:32:38 love that i brought my cbd pen but forgot the oil :))))))))))))
3177 2018-10-21 17:32:36 Of course you defend #plastics since you are the plastics industry. It's never a good choice to create new oil based plastics packaging. And no, oil based plastics use resources and also adds to #globalwarming. Compare that to e.g. plant based plastics or #recycle paper.
3178 2018-10-21 17:32:31 Stop buying Saudi oil! Without the income they can’t buy weapons!
3179 2018-10-21 17:32:26 And
3180 2018-10-21 17:32:20 Translation: “Yes, I think he did (but we will look the other way because of oil and guns and money).” 
3181 2018-10-21 17:32:18 Here's how to fill out the Initiatives on the Washington State ballot that just arrived in your mail.

If you agree that:
Oil companies shouldn't run the world, then vote yes on 1631.
Coca-Cola shouldn't run the world, no on 1634.
The NRA shouldn't run the world, yes on 1639.
3182 2018-10-21 17:32:13 @abc_es La Estación de servicio Global Oil de San MIGUEL de Salinas viola el derecho de sus trabajadores.
3183 2018-10-21 17:31:45 Aaog also very good but lower Denjo zone is the play we know there is oil further up at r1/r2
3184 2018-10-21 17:31:45 I deserve to win because my hubby steals all of my pyrex to use to collect engine oil or put screws in.  I need a set I can use for my cooking. #Mahahome
3185 2018-10-21 17:31:36 The Saudi states rogue tentacles are firmly wrapped arounnd the US testicles. Oil is king!
3186 2018-10-21 17:31:27 So what would you like to do to Saudi Arabia? 
Remove our military bases? Stop their oil exports? If we refuse to sell them arms China & Russia are waiting in line. What is your solution?
3187 2018-10-21 17:31:15 Can you get me some eucalyptus oil 
3188 2018-10-21 17:31:08 I got them from the Peewee A jr oil barons
3189 2018-10-21 17:31:05 These are usually Nigerian or Ugandan men wanting a doorway into UK. They either "work on an oil rig", or " the control room of a mine" have a son and recently lost their wife...and then it begins .. be careful girls ..
3190 2018-10-21 17:31:05 NPC #107632411956

Alberta oil bad, pipeline bad, environment go boom.
3191 2018-10-21 17:31:01 Same as kale or spinach, thinly sliced and pan fried with olive oil and a dash of soy sauce or lemon as a side - or added into sauces or soup dishes!
3192 2018-10-21 17:30:52 It also doesn’t look like $13 Billion/yr leaving  to import foreign oil while Feds denounce the oil sands, reject #NorthernGateway move regulatory goalposts on #EnergyEast & open the  regulatory review process to worldwide intervenors with C69.
3193 2018-10-21 17:30:48 This is sounding more and more like Cloverfield hahaha Oil Rigs and bunkers hahaha I love it!!!
3194 2018-10-21 17:30:44 Traveling the country selling cheap wares and making promises to further divide the people. A proud time in America.  We have a snake oil salesmen running his personal self promotional campaign.  Barnstorming - congratulations Mr Hainey
3195 2018-10-21 17:30:40 We cannot trust this administration's self-serving agenda. Oil is thicker than the blood on everyone's hands. Yes, sanctions may cause a rift in the Middle East, a loss of Saudi investment dollars and even higher oil prices. It's time we join the world and #DoTheRightThing
3196 2018-10-21 17:30:38 Um... hoping there would be some more incentives. How's the financing? What about free oil changes for a year? Anything like that?
3197 2018-10-21 17:30:32 But that doesn't mean we won't buy Saudi Arabian oil.

3200 2018-10-21 17:29:54 Lying again there is no way he can manage this, he is just trying to drum up votes, don’t believe the man behind the curtain, the con man, the snake oil salesmen @realDonaldTrump
3201 2018-10-21 17:29:52 We don't need oil anymore.  There is this new invention... Called electricity.  Also this thing called "Solar"... Look it up.  It's the FUTURE.  And we have plenty of Sun down here.  Not cold and miserable.
3202 2018-10-21 17:29:42 Wondering if there has ever been a reputable scientific study comparing the pollution created by imported oil compared to that of Canadian oil? If anyone is able to relay that info I would be keen to read it.
3203 2018-10-21 17:29:36 Careful with the oil Max. We don't want a North Sydney Friday night fire.
3204 2018-10-21 17:29:27 We can no longer trust anyone involved in profit from oil.this include auto makers that are fooling you in order to maintain what is profitable for them.I suggest you look into the system of hydrogen including efficiency ratios a maybe look at its explosive properties! #Ebus4PTBO
3205 2018-10-21 17:29:27 habis bersihin muka pakai baby oil, sampe skrg berminyak bgt dah nih muka:(
3206 2018-10-21 17:29:25 The only reason why people continue to suffer w/ seizure disorders etc., is due to money in politics and money in medicine. Dark money and greedy people who are preventing real, safe, broad spectrum medical care w/ the usage of cannabis oil. #EndingWarOnDrugs #MoneyOutOfPolitics
3207 2018-10-21 17:29:10 Mami u that invited papa into the Ozza room be asking for oil 
3208 2018-10-21 17:29:06 He fully admitted he fell for a snake oil salesman and voted for him twice. The important thing is that he woke up and voted right the last time.
3209 2018-10-21 17:28:54 - we will impose sanctions that do not impact oil, probably on parts and support for Yemen war
- Trump will extract a lower oil price (through more oil) for his economy
- MBS wants a face saving way out of Yemen, the US will give him that
- Turkey will have freer hand in Syria
3210 2018-10-21 17:28:49 Yes the wait was a mistake and ended up not being worthwhile. But Nigeria was nonetheless headed for a disaster. Rigidly monolithic economy, falling oil price, unbridled stealing by those leaving. We were not going to get anywhere. PMB's inactions only exacerbated it.
3211 2018-10-21 17:28:46 Does the anti bullying extend to not murdering orang utans in the pursuit of cheep palm oil?
3212 2018-10-21 17:28:41 Looool. See ehn, when you have money, you can do as you please. Every country want a slice of that oil, so why not take the piss.
3213 2018-10-21 17:28:36 Let's see. We are going to squeeze Iran and Saudi Arabia has agree to step up oil production otherwise they WILL CUT PRODUCTION and prices can exceed 100 per barrel. That is $5 to $10 per gallon of gas. 
WWII we dealt with Stalin & China who later fought against us Korea, Vietnam
3214 2018-10-21 17:28:34 noxzema & coconut oil is all i use on my face

3218 2018-10-21 17:28:28 Wrong-US oil imports have been decreasing for years as its doestic production has dramatically increased. Even if Saudi Arabia stopped selling oil to the US, other sources are available.
3219 2018-10-21 17:28:21 As long as saudis have the oil and checkbook to buy weapons from the US, nothing matters. It will be forgotten like other atrocities. The US is no supporter of human rights

3224 2018-10-21 17:27:47 Yet he would continue to buy oil from Saudi than from his own country.
3225 2018-10-21 17:27:45 Would Putin let 45 produce more oil than Russia for the first time since 1999?

Do you agree with Putin or 45 with regards to the Paris Accords?

Do you agree with Putin or 45 with regards to the Iran Deal? 

Do you agree with Putin or 45 with regards to the Keystone Pipeline?
3226 2018-10-21 17:27:40 Eyka pakai toner simple and moisturiser simple tapi since pakai tu naik tiny bumps. Tak tahu toner yg problem ke atau moisturiser. Oil cleanser pun eyka pakai simple punya
3227 2018-10-21 17:27:40 If the world's democracy had any balls they would refuse to buy any Saudi oil for a few months and watch them come crawling back to ask for forgiveness
3228 2018-10-21 17:27:32 Change my oil
3229 2018-10-21 17:27:24 Agreed, which is why there are big (D) Senators already calling for Saudi oil to be embargoed. Do these idiots even realize what the consequences of such an action would be on world oil prices through the OPEC countries? We would see $150 per barrel oil prices & $5 per gallon gas

3231 2018-10-21 17:27:22 Top 10 were fighting, then a car dumped oil and half of the grid spun off and caused a  Will won the cship as he was able to get out of the gravel himself, Sam couldnt take restart as he was off when the  was flown. Shame the rules dictated the result. Very exciting race
3232 2018-10-21 17:27:19 uhuhu a good oil day
3233 2018-10-21 17:26:54 Use oil and heal up sis
3234 2018-10-21 17:26:53 Wave power. Wind power. Solar power. Kinetic energy. Air and wave windmills. Start now for bright future for our children’s children. Let’s save the oil just incase robots take over in the future.
3235 2018-10-21 17:26:44 Still stunned he was voted in! Never thought people would fall for this shmuck. He's a snake oil salesman who has his own caravan of followers.
3236 2018-10-21 17:26:40 For heaven's sake Heid, spit it out
3237 2018-10-21 17:26:40 It's not a misconception because it's true. Finland introduced welfare programs after WWII. Sweden had had some form of welfare since 1700s. Neither have oil reserves. Both created prosperity by educating and looking after their citizens so that wealth created was spread equally
3238 2018-10-21 17:26:33 I literally just sautè (in olive or canola oil) Green Beans and roughly chopped Portabellini Mushrooms with some crushed garlic, salt, pepper and a bit of paprika. Fry for about 7min so that the Green Beans still have a crunch to them
3239 2018-10-21 17:26:08 My daughter who’s in HR with a major oil company just told 800 people they’re laid off from all over Texas. She got her pink slip shortly after they asked her to lay everyone else off.
3240 2018-10-21 17:26:02 Vegans will judge you for eating meat, but then they ignore the fact that they waste paper and deforestation harms animals. The things they recycle don’t actually get recycled and end up in the oceans harming animals. Will take numerous flights and the oil dumped harms animals 
3241 2018-10-21 17:26:01 Snake oil hawker @POTUS vows to rush out ill-conceived policy as an election gimmick, which is destined to further blow up the deficit (and, without question, will undermine middle class in some other foreseeable way).
3242 2018-10-21 17:25:59 Missing Italy is currently manifesting itself in the form of me putting olive oil on / with EVERYTHING
3243 2018-10-21 17:25:42 Chemical oil and drug cartel - sickening corporations.
3244 2018-10-21 17:25:38 its coming ...im laughing too much to tweet it.
3245 2018-10-21 17:25:25 And we will also PAY FOR IT. Tax payer $$$ build the roads that oil rigs drive in on to extract resources that line the pockets of the private industry that extracts the resources. A gas company tried to get rate payers in my state to build their private pipeline. It got vetoed.
3246 2018-10-21 17:25:19 @ToyotaCustCare 2014 Toyota Prius w/ an oil eating problem.  I’m down 1/2 Q in 1K Miles. Brought to dealer who said it’s an acceptable level of oil loss, but later offered to cover parts (not labor) for new piston/rings, not covered under extended warranty! Total scam artists!
3247 2018-10-21 17:25:18 You have ignored proof. You have ignored science. 98% of the world’s scientists aren’t in a conspiracy against the globe. The oil companies certainly are.
3248 2018-10-21 17:25:14 Damn 
3249 2018-10-21 17:25:11 That’s because there’sat least 5 ways to explain everything in the Bible which works out just fine for snake oil salesmen .
3250 2018-10-21 17:24:57 Then of course there is the commercial disaster that is shale oil production....anyone would think they had a magic money tree
3251 2018-10-21 17:24:50 if anything - the GOP can claim they aren't always with POTUS for the midterms and POTUS can get Saudi to pump more oil and lower it's price to help him with midterms and the economy. This is a show.
3252 2018-10-21 17:24:49 hemp oil could replace petro oil in plastics.....just a thought
3253 2018-10-21 17:24:43 yes dear, all ears
3254 2018-10-21 17:24:37 Hey man, there’s neither snake nor oil in this bottle you sold me. 

Sorry no refunds.
3255 2018-10-21 17:24:29 Plus the detailed descriptions of capture, slaughter, and making oil
3256 2018-10-21 17:24:17 The Russian troll farm has been burning the midnight oil here on Twitter.  Trumpbots be triggered!!!!!
3257 2018-10-21 17:24:17 I just do hot oil treatments it helps a lot tbh
3258 2018-10-21 17:24:12 Lol good luck selling oil in anything but dollars.

3262 2018-10-21 17:23:44 All these ribbons in Lucas Oil Stadium with ads, no football scores to be found.
3263 2018-10-21 17:23:41 Put very hot oil in ur nose 
3264 2018-10-21 17:23:40 And oil changes and Costco runs.
3265 2018-10-21 17:23:38 Inspired by the little known, rarely recited "Crashing through barricades, fighting with police..." second stanza of "The New Colossus."
3266 2018-10-21 17:23:35 God bless! May you watch with enough oil and join in the feast when He comes.
3267 2018-10-21 17:23:32 This is all about putting Trump down.
You will all be crying when Saudi adjusts crude oil prices and fuel prices jump.
3268 2018-10-21 17:23:31 Is it me or do games at Lucas Oil Stadium, seem like its way to quiet & boring? Maybe the sound doesn't chime through on the tv & its louder in person. #bills #GoBills
3269 2018-10-21 17:23:19 I’ll acknowledge this now. I thought the Iraq war seemed like a reasonable idea. Get rid of a despot, secure some oil, promote democracy in the Middle East. I was an idiot and I won’t be making that mistake again. #Brexit
3270 2018-10-21 17:23:14 I've been asking that question since the season Lucas Oil opened.
3271 2018-10-21 17:23:12 Lucas Oil Stadium is the most dangerous place to play.
3272 2018-10-21 17:23:03 Not sure what you mean. They own 1/3 of Syrian territory and 80% of its oil reserves and 100% of its hydro power. I'd say they did pretty well for what you call homeless folks.
3273 2018-10-21 17:22:52 We've got to do more than just stop oil pipelines from being put in. The existing ones, & the industry behind them, will all have to be dismantled. Physically. By us. Nobody else'll do it. The life on this planet depends on this happening. The Black Snake must die for us to live!
3274 2018-10-21 17:22:48 Did they not think to use butter or cooking oil. Geez! A chain saw?  Mom was very trusting
3275 2018-10-21 17:22:47 The Saudis should have been reigned in after 9/11. They destroyed our relationship w Qatar where 3,500 U.S. troops r located, &  drew us in2 their war in Yemen.  These regressive barbarians continually commit egregious human rights abuses. We don’t need them or their oil anymore.
3276 2018-10-21 17:22:46 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
3277 2018-10-21 17:22:44 Help protect an acre of forrest land. Irresponsible oil and gas production, unsustainable agriculture and illegal logging are destroying the world's forests. That means we lose out: Forests filter our air and water,
3278 2018-10-21 17:22:40 Ah, sorry. I totally misread that.

It's my understanding that he wants the pipeline done so that we're no longer trapped only selling to the U.S. and it could remove some of that dependency on foreign oil. That said, as I mentioned before, I'm not settled on his methods.
3279 2018-10-21 17:22:38 Is it just me, or is CBS using a lower camera position for the #Colts #Bills game today than normal? The main game action shot is normally much higher at Lucas Oil...today's is much better to watch. I hope it's a permanent change.
3280 2018-10-21 17:22:34 There must be an oil issue with Ted. Hahahahaha.... They are trying to open bonnet. Brilliant!
3281 2018-10-21 17:22:33 Palm oil will be the death of me
3282 2018-10-21 17:22:32 Sanctions on Iran concerning oil imports are about to be levied. Because of trump, gas prices are about to explode to higher prices once again!
3283 2018-10-21 17:22:17 Dad got me all new tires and an oil change. 10/10 fall break :-)
3284 2018-10-21 17:22:11 Poutine for supper tonight means a pot of oil on the stovetop. I have eggs, sausage & panko. The stars have aligned.
3285 2018-10-21 17:22:00 I can clear 5-2 with 2 ship teams, and level up a back row while I'm at it.. just that front row sucks lol

I guess I can try to run them on a lower level for a few rounds.  This is where I use that 9 hour commission usually, but I actually ran out of oil today
3286 2018-10-21 17:21:58 oil day is a good day?

3288 2018-10-21 17:21:56 Sure you care, killing our oil industry so we need to import more Saudi oil. Do you have any idea how hypocritical you sound? It's as if  you are talking out of your rear end.
3289 2018-10-21 17:21:54 Maduro's DICTATORSHIP has led #Venezuela to POVERTY, the most EXTREME HUNGER ever seen in any country, even though there is oil wealth, which is obviously not shared with its people. And it is only used to finance and restrict FREEDOM of expression.
3290 2018-10-21 17:21:41 Children of God...praise the Lord!!!
This week God delivered me from series of accidents including having hot oil poured on me but I thank God it wasn't dat serious...and most importantly he directed my Divine helpers my way...
More testimonies on the way...
AMEN!
3291 2018-10-21 17:21:34 Offices are empty in downtown Calgary because oil and gas people are terrible at handling money and built towers to their greatness without any projects to pay for them.

3293 2018-10-21 17:21:29 Only about three Americans know what an aubergine might be. 
Having said that — chop up said aubergine into thumb-sized chunks and bake with crushed tomatoes, rotini, olive oil, red pepper, granulated garlic, thyme, fennel, salt. Add mozzarella once the aubergines have softened.
3294 2018-10-21 17:21:21 I usually use maracuja oil for my dry face in the winter but does anybody  have any other suggestions? Lotion 2 to 3 times a day just doesn't cut it for me in the cold. 
3295 2018-10-21 17:21:20 Oil change about to be all damn day 
3296 2018-10-21 17:21:17 In my opinion, critical thinking should come first. Let me explain, as technology becomes more available, people will use it to sell snake oil everywhere. It will be really DIFFICULT to separate what is a solution from vaporware. Nothing to say about hybrid threats and propaganda
3297 2018-10-21 17:21:13 Dear Nigerians...

3299 2018-10-21 17:21:08 これからは堂々とガーヤウ add oil使っていくか…
3300 2018-10-21 17:21:07 I reject the whole idea of expansion exposure as relevant.  If you insist, view the alternative as Oil needing to trade to fill a D spot if 75 goes back, that cost, that exposure, that issue next yr
3301 2018-10-21 17:21:03 Colts offense doing little to energize Lucas Oil. Two 3-and-out. 6 plays, 15 yards. Mack 4 rushes 15 yards. Luck 0-1 and failed 3rd and 1 sneak.
3302 2018-10-21 17:20:53 it's irrefutable fact that many non-Muslim Nigerians are being killed by Muslims who the government fails to reign in

it's irrefutable fact that government forces sometimes kill peaceful non-Muslim protesters

it's irrefutable fact the West fails to condemn this
because of OIL!
3303 2018-10-21 17:20:52 Oil and water is what we are!
3304 2018-10-21 17:20:35 これ見てえんだけど見つかんねえ
3305 2018-10-21 17:20:31 You don't make policy on belief of heresay. You make policy on facts. I guess Russia and China will have a lot of fun with Saudi oil and even more fun watching the dollar uncouple from oil if Congress gets their way.
3306 2018-10-21 17:20:21 Man cannot live on #Zimdancehall alone. We want our cooking oil

3312 2018-10-21 17:19:40 I dont know ya know Di, them countries where never really stable, they certainly are not now, and do themselves much harm, But the old Saudis back many of the mosques, and fund the Islamic tutors, their kind of Islam, dont know whats going to happen when we dont need oil !!

3324 2018-10-21 17:18:16 Realism to understand strengths and capability of government so to score them on such. Nigeria's revenue from oil in the past year could not even fund its recurrent budget. That's how bad the position of the government is. Despite that this govt gave necessary bailouts.

3327 2018-10-21 17:17:46 Agree, and I think everything needs to be viewed through the lens of Saudis running out of oil, in desperate need of foreign capital investment and also of Israel's goal to dominate gas fields in the Eastern Med.
3328 2018-10-21 17:17:41 I fear he's worse than that. He was put in to lull Christians & beat down moral. Are you old enough to remember him telling us to put on a sweater because of the oil "shortage"? A willing puppet. (BTW, I do wear sweaters but the message was that it wasn't going to get better.)

3334 2018-10-20 23:59:58 In addition to the fact that Saudi Arabia still has an impact in the oil market not as stated by the author, and this is due to many reasons. One of which is saudi can sell oil at very low price unlike the states or any other country in the world due to the low cost of extraction
3335 2018-10-20 23:59:52 It’s healthy, there’s no use of oil or grease

It doesn’t fucking come off. Coconut oil, makeup remover, bloody acetone. It doesn’t budge.
3338 2018-10-20 23:59:12 Indeed. Our apathy knows no bounds. And since govt is in the pocket of big oil nothing would be done at that level. I'd love to see a citizens group band together and publicly shame stations into a price war, or at least a tiny bit of actual competition.

3359 2018-10-20 23:58:41 Basically the system was that techniques were passed to one generation of artists to another generation. Also, the way your art looks can be just because of technological advancements (think of oil painting where artists had way much more time to add details compared to tempera.
3360 2018-10-20 23:58:34 Anyone who wants to see parents who don't give up, see the movie Lorenzo's oil. That will show you how parents will not give up in spite of what doctors say. I can't tell u how many times I was told i'd have and early death. I'm in my mid seventies. So to the doctors, HA.
3361 2018-10-20 23:58:32 Sophie's album 'Oil of every Pearl's Un-Insides' is one of the best albums that i've ever heard
3362 2018-10-20 23:58:11 Mowed and edged the lawn, applied fall fertilizer,  took a truckload of junk to the landfill,  a truckload of stuff to donate to thrift store,  took out the garden, changed the oil in my truck,  and walked the dog (multiple times)... I'm ready to sit down and play video games
3363 2018-10-20 23:57:52 Some say when he masturbates he ejaculates crude oil.

3367 2018-10-20 23:57:32 "If you control the oil you control the country. If you control food, you control the population."

3368 2018-10-20 23:57:16 Nobody cares they funded 9/11, nobody cares about this. As long as they have oil and cash, all in power look the other way. Nobody wants to pay $20 a gallon for gas.
3369 2018-10-20 23:57:08 Off this oil stuck 
3370 2018-10-20 23:56:53 Look at what trump said in 2016 about the Saudis. Do the opposite of what they say. Don’t buy their oil etc all lies. He’s doing business for himself now.
3371 2018-10-20 23:56:24 Soak in Epsom salts bath. Or get magnesium cream/oil.

3374 2018-10-20 23:56:19 Words.  Nothing but words...  It is our actions that define us.   So long as the world does business with them including selling them weapons and buying their oil and allows them to persecute women the world enables them.  Criticism of them falls on deaf ears.
3375 2018-10-20 23:56:15 Nothing feels better than when you are freshly shaved. Then you got the baby oil to top it off... CLUTCH ASF
3376 2018-10-20 23:56:05 I used Neutrogena Rain Bath, 10-0-6 lotion and Oil of Olay exclusively for decades. I love those three products! #scentsofmyyouth
3377 2018-10-20 23:55:40 What's with fuel prices at the moment? $1.69 seems like a lot. Normally this means we've invaded an oil state.
3378 2018-10-20 23:55:35 And 5050 for rubbish collection, construction work, quarrying, oil drilling, male prostitution...running faster than a woman, lifting more than a woman..
3379 2018-10-20 23:55:31 Now to go put this oil in my ear  is straight in bed after
3380 2018-10-20 23:55:23 Hey anybody happen to know if ABS is safe to use with fuel oil?
3381 2018-10-20 23:55:21 Peppermint oil in a carrier is really helpful. And a weighted bag on the eyes while laying on my side can help in the moment.
3382 2018-10-20 23:55:11 Whats more natural than oil? Where does it come from? A better question is why you hate all natural oil and support synthetic, non biodegradable, silicone based man manufactured Solar? As with all your issues, a tax takers mirage
3383 2018-10-20 23:55:04 The sanctions are curtailing investments in and out of Russia. The main EU sanctions are on oil and gas, banking, military and finance.

Russia needs the tech from western countries to drill for oil and gas, which it can’t get anymore

Investments are frozen, and so is military
3384 2018-10-20 23:55:01 I’d rather he smoke a cigar as an “analyst” for Alabama than ever be on our sidelines again. Man is a fraud and a snake oil salesman.

3387 2018-10-20 23:54:33 Coz ARAMCO (7 sisters) originally a group of American/European oil co’s pumped all saudi oil. Now Saudi Aramco. Imagine all that oil going to RU or CH. Hedging the US’s bets. And they are good clients of all American goods and services.

3392 2018-10-20 23:53:15 It's interesting you mention that cannabis doesn't work for you, as I've heard the same thing from other CPP's; Even CBD oil, which is the non-psychoactive component, isn't always the elixir that people suffering hope for. Though my spine has largely healed, it opened my eyes.
3393 2018-10-20 23:53:11 So I heard but liiiiiike I'm scared that if I dont use oil free products, its gonna make me shinier
3394 2018-10-20 23:53:05 After this three day Mid-Atlantic Provincial Gathering...I’m so empowered, encouraged and excited about what the LORD is doing in this season of kingdom ministry. PHCC...get ready for this oil I’m bring back tomorrow!!!
3395 2018-10-20 23:52:57 Yep. My bet is he wouldn’t expect Nats to reverse their hikes in excise.
And we’re committed to invest in transport strategy. The funding comes from excise, consolidated fund or investment cuts elsewhere. We need to get off oil dependency as a longer term imperative
3396 2018-10-20 23:52:50 Invest in clean energy. End dependence on Saudi oil.

3402 2018-10-20 23:52:21 Think of how artists used to have "patrons", that's the basic idea.
3403 2018-10-20 23:52:09 Don’t use oil-free products, that just makes your face produce more oil.
3404 2018-10-20 23:51:49 They stole our oil, next will be our drinking water because they’ve contaminated their own.

3414 2018-10-20 23:50:42 Hi Cynthia I'm sorry to hear it didn't work for u. all CBD Oil is not the same. Most of them use fillers and harsh chemicals to process. Some of them claim to have CBD Oil in them and don't. I didn't see that u ordered from me. We have a 30 day empty bottle money back guarantee.
3415 2018-10-20 23:50:41 Basically what I am saying is a lot of people make money selling “snake oil” I think you refer to it like this in the states and sorry to say jesse felder seem like one of them, I would be happy to challenge him in live trading?
3416 2018-10-20 23:50:35 When I completely eschewed shampoo, I still used coconut oil to help shape it. You might give that a try.
3417 2018-10-20 23:50:34 Anybody else’s dad teach them how to change their oil and check the tire pressure when they were younger but completely forgot ?

I using red apple vinegar right now for fall.
3433 2018-10-20 23:47:21 I thought this was supposed to be common sense o. But what do u know? Is it reducing the palsy non oil revenue base of the government that’s gonna solved the problem or research into what makes up the cost of production and then finding way to reduce it.

3441 2018-10-20 23:46:12 which includes additional criteria going beyond current Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification standards. We are supportive of the Australian Government inquiry into the establishment of a Modern Slavery Act in Australia. Thanks. 5/5
3442 2018-10-20 23:46:05 We support global initiatives to increase transparency and improve the protection of forests and human rights in the palm oil supply chain including the Consumer Goods Forum's Palm Oil Sourcing Guidelines, 4/5
3443 2018-10-20 23:45:50 Arguments using extreme scenarios to suggest either nuclear or solar/wind are high emission are petty and distract focus from real problem, the massively bigger emissions from coal, gas and oil. 5/5

3445 2018-10-20 23:45:35 The palm oil used in our own branded food products supports the production of RSPO-certified sustainable palm oil. Woolworths labels palm oil to give customers choice and labels our own brand food products where palm oil is used as an ingredient. 3/5
3446 2018-10-20 23:45:26 My people oil is not good for you. Cholesterol
3447 2018-10-20 23:45:24 Banning the use of sustainable certified palm oil could lead to more deforestation, as other oil crops have considerably less yield per hectare. We became a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in 2010. 2/5
3448 2018-10-20 23:44:58 The use of palm oil is on the rise as global demand for vegetable oil is growing fast. Palm oil is a versatile and efficient choice with significantly higher yields of oil per hectare than soya beans, rapeseed or sunflowers.
3449 2018-10-20 23:44:55 So this black jamaican castor oil smells a little. Hope it helps.
3450 2018-10-20 23:44:52 It was so much easier when it was this length. In this pic it was just a little leave in, a tiny bit of oil, and some eco styler. 

Right now my hair is much longer and I’m having issues retaining moisture.
3451 2018-10-20 23:44:26 If the US won't take Saudi money for weapons, Russia & China will. Saudi can push the price of oil up, hurting most of the world. Want to keep them opposing Iran - worst would be if they unite against US & West. Proportion needs to be taken - not a knee-jerk emotional response.
3452 2018-10-20 23:44:21 Hi Brad, we understand your point of view, however, palm oil is an edible vegetable oil derived from the mesocarp (reddish pulp) of the fruit of the oil palms. Palm oil is a commonly used ingredient in many food and non-food products. 1/5

3469 2018-10-20 23:41:21 There's a rumor going around that there's a con man going around selling snake oil in this country. Rides this contraption called 'Air Force One'. Dang it Ma, get me my shotgun off the shelf!
3470 2018-10-20 23:41:17 The man has made it very clear he wants to get rid of Medicare and it’s a fact he has no loyalty to social security.

3471 2018-10-20 23:41:07 Yet look at them now competing with China and USA. They don’t have oil just them selves. We are always looking for excuses to validate ourselves rather than facing head on our current problem, isn’t Ethiopia multi ethnic

3481 2018-10-20 23:40:01 there is never a good time to say this, but i feel like you need to know this. do you know the mormons have a hymn that goes "hold to the rod, the iron rod, tis strong and bright and true!" and carry around merch (keychains w/ anointing oil, etc) that say THE IRON ROD

3485 2018-10-20 23:39:09 Real world, after Fracking and Canadian tar sands, how much less dependent is the US on foreign oil?  Any idea?
3486 2018-10-20 23:39:05 You’re dragging it lmao but basically put oil before you wash your hair so it’ll stay moisturize after shampooing
3487 2018-10-20 23:39:01 And another extremely important point - that “tax break” will be swallowed up by rising oil prices before the ink is dry on any tax incentive law document being signed!!!
3488 2018-10-20 23:38:59 FYI - Beto is working with Nancy Pelosi and they plan on placing a $10 per barrel tax on oil that will kill 100,000+ oilfield jobs & raise the price of fuel at the pump.  A vote for Beto is a vote AGAINST oilfield related jobs.  Think before you vote.  Your job may depend on it

They deniers chose to disbelieve the obvious.
3491 2018-10-20 23:38:36 Out of stock, everywhere. Something which was easily accessible & not a drug has now become a rarity. Of course, price has doubled. CBD oil, 0% THC, bring it back, please. It's used in sports, by people who don't want to get high. Otherwise, we'll have to buy it outside Canada.
3492 2018-10-20 23:38:11 Ya, NO. Tar is a derivative of COAL, not oil.

3495 2018-10-20 23:37:40 Qatar, UAE and Saudi are the same to me. Bunch of fat thugs sitting on pillows trying to rule the world with oil money and the Quran. What else you got?
3496 2018-10-20 23:37:34 just slathered myself in peppermint oil, violet, lavender, frankincense & myrrh, geranium and cedarwood
3497 2018-10-20 23:37:14 Gasoline prices have been rising fairly steadily since late 2016 when OPEC decided to curb its oil production. Experts say that is the main driver of rising prices, though there are others outside Trump’s control as well.
3498 2018-10-20 23:37:13 lmao how you know??? and a lil but of coconut oil sis
3499 2018-10-20 23:36:51 Not that difficult, stop selling arms. Mexico and Brazil have a lot of oil...
3500 2018-10-20 23:36:48 Fellow folks with ungodly oily skin: what do you use to exfoliate? I am going to try a (natural) luffa next. 

P.S. Oil is natural waterproofing, FYI. We might be selkies and just not know it.
3501 2018-10-20 23:36:39 Back on the fraud lieing block again I see. Distorting facts and using half truths to push your socialist agenda. You are nothing but a snake oil salesmen Chuck. I am ashamed you are my senator.
3502 2018-10-20 23:36:36 Tar is a derivative of coal, not oil. It shows a lack of understanding and/or willingness to learn the facts of the issue.
3503 2018-10-20 23:36:31 Bit hard to reply on demand when you’re working 13 hour shifts on an oil rig
3504 2018-10-20 23:36:28 Thinking it was 3 in 1 oil. Lol. Weather is coming. Getting pretty gusty in central right now. Still no rain tho.
3505 2018-10-20 23:36:27 Global demand UP! Oil prices UP! But Alberta oil prices DOWN? What kind of business sense is this??
3506 2018-10-20 23:36:04 Don't forget the Dems will then rebrand the war as a "war for oil".
3507 2018-10-20 23:36:03 Gonna go with suggesting that maybe, just maybe the oil companies, merchants of doubt, and the Republican party and its enablers are to blame for public murkiness around settled science. And a lack of media coverage and media using false balance.
3508 2018-10-20 23:35:55 PS: The fact that gold/oil has been so stable for so long is a big reason why gold futures were launched.
3509 2018-10-20 23:35:36 My favourite essential oil is bacon grease
3510 2018-10-20 23:35:25 Canada is seeing the broadest sector growth in 14 years. The only losses are oil companies who know tar oil will be worthless before any new developments can be finished.
3511 2018-10-20 23:35:10 That reminds me, I need to stock up on squirrel oil.
3512 2018-10-20 23:34:55 My mum puts them outside to cool before putting in hot oil- and they are the ones
3513 2018-10-20 23:34:42 If gold and oil were anywhere near being relics, my feed would not be littered w KSA & Russia news.
3514 2018-10-20 23:34:26 Cooking oil
3515 2018-10-20 23:34:21 tea tree oil might be the only thing i care about
3516 2018-10-20 23:33:59 I used olive oil as lube this morning and felt very sex in Tuscany
3517 2018-10-20 23:33:52 JOE JOE....I guess you have a better solution...If we did nothing after 911...What makes you think anything but media criticism and uproar will happen?  OIL OIL OIL....I guess OIL and SAUDIS hold us and the world hostage!
3518 2018-10-20 23:33:46 W I G S and castor oil lmao
3519 2018-10-20 23:33:44 Wash acne-prone areas only twice a day. Washing removes excess oil &amp; dead skin cells. But too much washing can irritate the skin.
3520 2018-10-20 23:33:34 He will hit oil refineries.
3521 2018-10-20 23:33:30 Will you please watch James Corbett's "Why Big Oil Conquered The World". Thanks.
3522 2018-10-20 23:33:13 Why do we care? Is one dead terrorist sympathizing journalist worth crashing the potential reform of Saudi Arabia and spiking the world oil market? No.
3523 2018-10-20 23:33:13 Edited: norway had democratic institutions before oil wealth. And no neighbors fighting proxy wars with the blood of its sons.

3525 2018-10-20 23:33:05 People don’t come here to be leeches. They come here to live better. And in the end contribute to the economy. I’m sure dad who hauled frac tanks sure helped out the oil industry a lot especially since no one wants to haul frac tanks these days.
3526 2018-10-20 23:32:55 i leave my room for 2 minutes and when i come back i find all of my oil pastels broken on the floor,,, i’m so mad ugh and i know that it was my little cousin...
3527 2018-10-20 23:32:48 jesus to much money.

3528 2018-10-20 23:32:38 Ruble driven, they can keep it going with oil revenues.

3534 2018-10-20 23:31:51 I’m not totally convinced it’s stupidity. Tho it may be. I just don’t understand the logic completely. I know that the oil industry in general has a lot of power. And I’m pretty sure that we Went Saudi after 79.
3535 2018-10-20 23:31:37 Still searching for a good oil to use on my 4B/4C hair.

3537 2018-10-20 23:31:09 Lmao girl I have to pre poo (20-30min), deep condition (45min-1hr) and shampoo (5min) and then in between all that detangle, put in leave in conditioner and oil lmao girl how long are your wash day routine ?
3538 2018-10-20 23:31:07 The irony is that the oil industry has probably harmed UK manufacturing competitiveness. Being a net oil exporter inflated the value of the £ and made us very uncompetitive.

The current £ devaluation has helped exports but may be short live if fail to invest.
3539 2018-10-20 23:31:07 me & wendi put thc oil in this blunt and yaw 
3540 2018-10-20 23:30:36 this mosquito just bit me so now i’m bouta rip that nigga wings off and drop him in hot oil
3541 2018-10-20 23:30:31 If everyone especially the ones protesting oil, which is part of every product they own or the ones buying each new IPhone when they don't need it would just cut back & quit having to have the latest & greatest, then we would be in control, but we can't stop buying
3542 2018-10-20 23:30:15 I n my opinion, you are nothing. You have received over 3 million dollars for your personal gain. Paid by Oil, Gas and the NRA.

3545 2018-10-20 23:30:00 And we can’t pay back the debt we owe China will begin to seize our resources. We are both aware that our most valuable resource is our oil, without it the would be hardly any in come which would lead to a collapse of our government!
3546 2018-10-20 23:29:45 Any correlation with oil prices?
3547 2018-10-20 23:29:42 The president and the entire GOP are going to let all of these guys walk away. The same folks that bombed us on 9-11 killed another of our own. Oil, money and power.
3548 2018-10-20 23:29:42 Eastern Canada is paying billions for Saudi oil because Trudeau killed Energy East.
Now the Saudis will use Cdn mney to buy billions in U.S. arms. Cdm debt balloons with liberal spending abroad.

3549 2018-10-20 23:29:40 Seems our officials want @POTUS to mess in something that doesn't concern us.  What could that do to the price of oil, and how would That affect his economic gains?
3550 2018-10-20 23:29:19 It seems that Canadians are now required to get high...  Leave it to bureaucrats, to screw up a working system. CBD oil has been used in sports for years, to ease muscles pain & spasms. No prescription needed, it's not a psychotropic drug. Now, every GD bottle has THC in it.
3551 2018-10-20 23:29:13 @realDonaldTrump The point is that Saudi Arabia wants to take the place of Iran's oil, and they will no longer receive this money loot. They will kill a man to achieve their goals, President Trump will not be caught in their trap
3552 2018-10-20 23:29:09 Because it was the easier way to store wealth aside political currencies... but those days are ending and the digital age will garner new methods rendering gold and oil relics of past Economics

3556 2018-10-20 23:28:38 I love Libya. But it is not going to be Norway tomorrow. Norway is the only democratic oil economy, and it had the luck to be have established democratic institutional before the oil boom. It also did not have neighbouring countries fighting proxy ways with the blood of its sins.
3557 2018-10-20 23:28:33 No palm oil 
3558 2018-10-20 23:28:14 Dina muna pala ako mag paparebond tumalab bigla yung hot oil HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
3559 2018-10-20 23:27:50 Saudi had better go a shift on moving away from oil it's 90% of its export earnings & responsible for 87% of its budget reserves . I can only think it's diversifying into overseas hits
3560 2018-10-20 23:27:35 All lies and propaganda paid for by Big Oil and Old Auto ! Honestly why would you care unless you have financial incentive or are trying to manipulate the stock. Otherwise why spend your time on a company you hate. I hate southwestern air and I don’t spend one min bashing them.

3564 2018-10-20 23:26:52 One thing I’ve been primarily concerned about in the last 72hrs is the international diplomacy fallout from the Kashoggi murder by Saudi regime. 

This single act could set in motion chain of events that would send oil above $100
3565 2018-10-20 23:26:52 Just put oil in my car in a parking lot of a crackhead gas station. I love being 13,000 miles past an oil change.

3567 2018-10-20 23:26:35 Why do you think oil (most valuable commodity on earth) price of gold (useless per rock) has been so stable for so long?
3568 2018-10-20 23:26:30 Bolton is like hot oil - when used sparingly and with careful oversight it creates conditions to get things done, but when overused or unmanaged it will put you in the burn unit as it burns down the entire block.

Very, very mistaken.
3570 2018-10-20 23:26:26 As an Ottawa-insider, @jkenney tossed Alberta's oil and gas sector under the bus. He failed to get a pipeline built to tidewater. He wiped out $35.0 billion by taxing income trusts. And—he tried to sabotage a $15.1 billion energy deal. #ableg #abpoli #cdnpoli

3572 2018-10-20 23:25:54 ? If that were the case, we would have stopped buying Saudi oil ages ago and be relying exclusively on Canadian oil.

"In a recent telephone conversation with Saudi King Salman bin Abdul Aziz, US President #Trump urged Saudi Arabia to cut the oil prices. Was this just a #Media review ahead of the #US #Election or is it a new US strategy with the Gulf States? #NovemberIsComing...
3574 2018-10-20 23:25:36 Saudi petrodollars and stranglehold on world oil prices has made every US president their bitch since Nixon. At least Trump backed the reformist wing in their latest palace coup. Still thugs, but less dangerous ones to us.

3578 2018-10-20 23:25:17 impact of higher oil tho on Chinese CA balance tho is now very real, being the largest net oil importer and all.  so a true deficit in 19 is possible if oil stays high and China responds to trumph with a stimulus
3579 2018-10-20 23:25:14 For shiny hair, mix one egg with a olive oil and apply to your hair. Leave it on for 20-30 minutes then shower.

3581 2018-10-20 23:25:03 I can tell just by looking at it. It should be golden brown not oil brown
3582 2018-10-20 23:25:00 We went to Iraq to protect you.and your oil production. Hence the money that MBS spends today and without us you would be nothing more than a Sandy spot in the desert.
3583 2018-10-20 23:24:56 I was told by an Australian woman in Sydney yesterday that of course England would not let an independent Scotland keep the oil. Why would they?
She also asked, who would pay for an independent Scotland?

3592 2018-10-20 23:23:58 Hmmmm not sure I will bother. It's hard to decide which ... if either is worthy of my respect or time. Couple of snake oil salesmen
3593 2018-10-20 23:23:52 They don’t have full control. They’re allowed to set income tax levels only. Not corporation tax, Sch D, Sch E, ICT, VAT, Oil Taxation, Inheritence Tax…I could go on - all controlled by WM, So how does that equate to ‘power & wealth’?

3600 2018-10-20 23:23:15 In my opinion, tell Americans how much Dark Money he received this year. ( Oil, Gas, and Coal Corporations).
3601 2018-10-20 23:23:03 their* and me too normally but the oil is almost unusable at least at this location
3602 2018-10-20 23:22:57 thanks

deficits with everyone else is false

CA deficit is debatable.  tis in the h1 data, but unlikely for the full year (tho have less confidence there with rise in oil/ potential tariff impact in q4, which is the big surplus quarter).
3603 2018-10-20 23:22:41 Received a turntable for my 50th birthday and am loving going through old records- playing Midnight Oil from 1984. Feeling very old.
3604 2018-10-20 23:22:31 1/ Heh, you're entitled to your opinion.  Let me ask just one question: CAN YOU EAT OIL?  Because the US can make it that way.  And we should.  Or worse.  There's not jack and crap you can do about it if we do either; we no longer NEED your oil.
3605 2018-10-20 23:22:30 Grilled with a little olive oil and kosher salt?
3606 2018-10-20 23:22:26 it's not that, the oil should last around a 3 days, but clearly this oil has been used way past it's need to be trashed

3616 2018-10-20 23:20:26 All for Israel's Red Sea oil route monopoly. They also got the added plus of having thousands of people invade Europe as "Syrian" "refugees" from Africa to undermine the cultures that tossed them out repeatedly for hundreds of years, all while the M/I complex profited.

3618 2018-10-20 23:20:22 In my opinion, you should stress the fact of Climate Change. How much the far right gets paid for extracting oil and gas. Destroying our awesome Parks and Native Americans land.

3621 2018-10-20 23:20:00 only ate around 19 nuggets and I can't do anymore, not cause I'm full but because the oil they used to cook these nuggets is just terrible, what a waste @BurgerKing

(How come firefighters have sexy calenders, but cops don't? Is that because a lot of domestic disputes are about sex?)
3628 2018-10-20 23:19:13 its 1/3 more specific 83 percent of the paychecks issued are from a privately owned company, yeah the oil industry was nationalized in 1976 how that would be relevant now? socialism doesn't lead to tyranny, power leads to tyranny and nothing centralizes power like capitalism.

3632 2018-10-20 23:18:45 you know that you are cherished that in your darkest moments your beloved sends you gifs of jason statham writhing, covered in oil, in speedos
3633 2018-10-20 23:18:43 @dexhakhak sana oil
3634 2018-10-20 23:18:43 Trump reminds me of a Holy Roller, Bible Salesman, better yet Snake Oil peddler. Hands always out-stretched. Preacher man preaching to the masses. 
3635 2018-10-20 23:18:36 The US´s+allies non stop attacks to Venezuela (20 years so far...) are just because it has the LARGER OIL RESERVE IN THE WORLD. It has nothing to do with socialism. The propaganda is just to fool the ones out there without brains that can think. Unfortunately there are too many.
3636 2018-10-20 23:18:29 There are a number of vaginal moisturisers that you can buy at the pharmacy but @DrSharonBober suggested that coconut oil can be used.
3637 2018-10-20 23:18:20 the moment that they ran out of oil, US will slaughter them, JUST LIKE A COW.
3638 2018-10-20 23:18:17 Coconut oil, shea butter, and beeswax. I listen to the wisdom of black woman to help me get thru this CO transition, man. 
3639 2018-10-20 23:18:17 @william_jhones online come and enjoy my oil show do not miss it come undress me and water it all over the body
3640 2018-10-20 23:18:07 all the US political system will going to lose it and yell like hell because they aint going to receive a single dime, thats what its all about: MONEY, until those freaking pumps are extracting oil the US government will milk saudi...
3641 2018-10-20 23:17:52 Nah ... I'd rather use the oil the chicken's FRIED in . . . it'll hurt a LOT worse.
3642 2018-10-20 23:17:48 IM IN NEED OF MODELS & BRAND AMBASSADORS FOR MY  HAIR OIL BRAND  PLEASE RT & SEND THIS TOO ALL YOUR FRIENDS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN WORKIN AND MAKING MONEY WITH ME 
3643 2018-10-20 23:17:43 So this is what the oil pastel practice things were for?  I wish I would have had you as an art teacher.  I am hard pressed to draw a stick figure.  :)
3644 2018-10-20 23:17:33 But really not until WWII did the oil consumption ramp to such a level that the money became like water in the rainforest
3645 2018-10-20 23:17:30 My friend thried those and said they rip easily. lol
Just get the regular ones
3646 2018-10-20 23:17:24 Hot tomato oil is life
3647 2018-10-20 23:17:23 "Rebels", right? Did they tell you what and who precipitated the "rebellion"? It was the genocide manipulated by Britain, which they subcontracted from Nigeria to wipe off Biafrans so as to retain the oil in Biafra, calling them Nigerians. 6 million deaths is genocide.
3648 2018-10-20 23:17:18 As long as they pay their bribes even if they blow up white house no one(except for people) is going to tell them a damn thing, thats how they get away with almost everything with fucking OIL DOLLARS, but lets assume that iran did even one of those things that they...
3649 2018-10-20 23:17:12 Rodents hate peppermint oil. We dilute it and spray it on the wooden grates around the outside of our house. Keeps the rats out of the underside of my raised house.
3650 2018-10-20 23:17:06 I certainly hope so. How much Saudi money/oil will it take to change your mind? Because you've gone all in with Trump and you own his response to this.
3651 2018-10-20 23:17:01 My coconut oil is finally solid so you know what that means 
3652 2018-10-20 23:16:52 japanese olive oil has the power to turn you into a roman marble statue
3653 2018-10-20 23:16:40 It’s not a coincidence that Allah put so much oil resources in Saudi. The world economy depends on that oil - We never leveraged that power 
3654 2018-10-20 23:16:37 おはゆ！！
3655 2018-10-20 23:16:32 With friends like these, who needs oil
3656 2018-10-20 23:16:12 1938 was first production. In 1933 Standard Oil (Aramco) started prospecting on the east side and found oil (Dharan).
3657 2018-10-20 23:16:12 Not sure why so many companies are adding SO many other unnecessary ingredients to their CBD oil. Makes no sense and it compromises the purity.  #THEPLANTISENOUGH
3658 2018-10-20 23:16:01 read this and thought about thieves the essential oil 
3659 2018-10-20 23:15:53 Just like the old N.Y. mob. Kill him, chop him up, put him in an oil drum. Forgedabowdit!
3660 2018-10-20 23:15:43 We can't address the truth *directly* so nobody has an absolute version of it! Those claiming that they do are snake oil mechants. 

As far as truth/untruth goes all we can do is use our fertile imagination to come up with guesses which can be verified/non verified or refuted.
3661 2018-10-20 23:15:35 Where did the CO2 in oil, gas and limestone come from?
3662 2018-10-20 23:15:33 @realDonaldTrump to punish daudi  open refinery coal into oil 6 ton coal is 2 ton oil  41% increase  our country will then control oil price in the world .
3663 2018-10-20 23:15:33 We for to long have relied on Saudi oil but that is no longer necessary so let us do the brave thing and declare them what they are, women hating, mean spirited killers.
3664 2018-10-20 23:15:29 I just made carrott fries, shout out to all who eat healthy- sometimes boring but good for you! Ok so carrots cut long or use baby carrots no need to cut, spray your pan or drizzle oil on the carrots and let them roast until they are soft 
3665 2018-10-20 23:15:28 Coconut oil on my wood
3666 2018-10-20 23:15:20 Yes.  They also drink soy milk from their plastic cup and protest big oil while driving in their gas guzzling suv's.

3671 2018-10-20 23:14:27 Dear Captain,
In the event you lose sight of the enemy, they’ve been known to leave a trail of their signature sauce wherever they travel. Godspeed Sir...May you be triumphant in battle at the big oil drum.
3672 2018-10-20 23:14:20 Tonight? 
I stay wierd
3673 2018-10-20 23:14:18 Doesn't Saudi Arabia build and fund majority of mosques in U.S and stock them with Saudi trained clerics? 
Democrats dont have a problem with that, and cheer it on.
3674 2018-10-20 23:14:16 Pull your troops. Stop buying their oil. End arms sales It’s a sick, perverted society/ culture/ nation. Be best.
3675 2018-10-20 23:14:05 I bet they also put oil in the transmission fluid too 
3676 2018-10-20 23:13:56 昨日はセトリを改変するなどしました。
3677 2018-10-20 23:13:48 I used coconut for the cooking oil, I prefer canola for taste.
3678 2018-10-20 23:13:42 standing outside of the dispensary door: hey can u just toss me a gram of oil pls
3679 2018-10-20 23:13:29 What happened to the UK's oil bonanza?
3680 2018-10-20 23:13:22 Use a nice deep penetrating keratin mask and when it's all washed out pop some John frieda extra strength thickening serum in for the daytime - mixing some argan oil in with your regular conditioner is always a golden move too
3681 2018-10-20 23:13:20 Rob McKenna represents Chevron Oil -- but his ads against a carbon fee don't disclose that ‘minor’ detail. Take these dishonest ads down @Kiro7Seattle @komonews @Q13Fox @KING5Seattle #waelex

3684 2018-10-20 23:13:06 IDK, they got a deal from the Saudis on oil for their tiki torches?

3687 2018-10-20 23:12:41 BUT IT'S AN ARAB COUNTRY SO IT MUST BE FILLED WITH OIL AND EVERYTHING THAT EVER HAPPENS THERE IS BECAUSE OF THE OIL
3688 2018-10-20 23:12:28 Wait until the export infrastructure is built-out...LNG will be a rival export to oil products 
3689 2018-10-20 23:12:15 Why do you suppose that the USA should trade with any country it doesn’t approve of, they have no obligation to trade with Venezuela, and when you trash your economy as bad as those clowns did, and become wholesale dependent on oil, what do you expect? Markets fluctuate.
3690 2018-10-20 23:12:07 It's so cold in my room that my coconut oil turned back into its solid form

3703 2018-10-20 23:09:59 It's also worth noting that modern Saudi Arabia didn't exist until the 20's. Prior to that it was a patchwork of tribal lands carved up by the British. It's geo-political power derived from oil rather than its ability to form a democratic culture. It's still evolving.
3704 2018-10-20 23:09:55 The fact that Walmart takes FOREVER to do a oil change. And I think it’s taking longer cause this lady started yelling and bitching cause it’s taking forever.
3705 2018-10-20 23:09:52 Come 1965 we became dependant on them for oil. Now our current government is so endowed by oil from them that we can't see past our own gaslight.
3706 2018-10-20 23:09:35 Oh good.  A two watt bulb accepting the challenge.  Trouble is that she will be forced to facts that will be greeted with no rational response and that ridiculous sophomoric grin that he wields like all good snake oil salesmen.  The #emperor pointed out his PHD. Ugh.
3707 2018-10-20 23:09:22 Maybe because other oil dependent countries don’t have massive sanctions against them? If you read my tweet you’ll see I said that AND about the economic blockade against them. Makes them easier to target.
3708 2018-10-20 23:09:18 If you really looking for justice,
Start with Saudi's funding ISIS For destroying Syria & Iraq.
Start with Vahabbi's who teach & publish violence & crimes all around Muslim countries.
Start with the criminals who Bombs Yemen.
And those who funded by oil US & UK 2 destroy Iraq.
3709 2018-10-20 23:09:18 Thanks so much for your @RoyalSaudiNews taking points. Do you get paid in oil or blood?
3710 2018-10-20 23:09:16 After the disgraceful performance he is now telling tweeters that he enjoyed reading the book, I now know the book is the Afro juju he is been protecting.
3711 2018-10-20 23:09:01 i mean, he's technically not wrong. In the state of US economics and politics of the past 50 years, losing saudi-arabia as arms sales and oil partner would be dramatic for the entire world. Sad story. doubt shit will ever change
3712 2018-10-20 23:08:53 Let's be honest, Lou doesn't actually give a shit beyond it being a convenient stick to beat Labour with. He knows as much as we do it's the oil companies responsible for majority of price hikes.
3713 2018-10-20 23:08:50 I spilled really good olive oil and I’m shook about it.
3714 2018-10-20 23:08:47 i tried cbd oil for once and it relaxes muscles p well but my depression skyrocketed lmao

How long before you started seeing results? Is there a specific brand or type to use? How often? Can it work on other dark marks as well?

Thanks
3718 2018-10-20 23:08:19 @deadlygardens you use CBD oil sometimes right, what has your experience been?
3719 2018-10-20 23:08:16 Combating Nazis in World War II is like Fighting Climate Change ?

3721 2018-10-20 23:07:49 Dropping the treaty will not force Russians back to fold but to a unconstrained buildup.

Heavy sanctions and cheap oil OTOH...
3722 2018-10-20 23:07:34 Stop giving our tax dollars to countries of Terrorism, when they should be spent in Canada. You call blowing 4.5 billion on a oil pipe line that can’t be built, a sound investment. Give you head a shake. Harper pulled us out of a recession. The Sock Puppet is creating one.
3723 2018-10-20 23:07:28 Yes then they cuddled up to USA. Britain couldn't afford the subsidies any more and of course USA was there to take over and picked up a lot of oil related money.
3724 2018-10-20 23:07:11 i put extra lavender oil in my humidifier last night why am i still depressed
3725 2018-10-20 23:06:59 That shows double standard is reality, imagine Jamal killed by different country will the #USA government reaction be the same or will it attack that country in the name of freedom and justice. Money and oil talks and louder than the truth. Thats normal act from dictators
3726 2018-10-20 23:06:26 I must be missing something here. Is there an oil field under it?
3727 2018-10-20 23:06:18 Do birth control pills cause/cure acne? Birth control pills may help some women control acne. The hormones in birth control pills can help block androgen hormones. Androgen puts oil glands into overdrive. Even if u take birth control pills, you'll still need a skincare routine.
3728 2018-10-20 23:06:12 That's so totally super believable... Fist fights happen all the time, right? Poor #Khashoggi just happened to fall into one. Phew! That's one less mystery to worry about now. Back to ancient aliens!

[Hope oil gets cheaper! Wink! Wink!]
3729 2018-10-20 23:05:32 Completely poor country with no resources or outreach until oil was discovered in 1965 +/-

3733 2018-10-20 23:04:50 The cruelest joke that God played on the world was putting oil under the Sands of Saudi Arabia.

3740 2018-10-20 23:04:24 Aljanna ta kowa ce. Me nema ya sai ya bada.
3741 2018-10-20 23:04:20 Yes before they discovered oil and the forth coming wealth that allowed them to separate themselves from the British.
3742 2018-10-20 23:04:10 Oil prices yes they are part of it, the sanctions are against a minority of corrupt leaders. The government itself has a lot to answer for too.
3743 2018-10-20 23:04:04 Boycott all Saudi oil at once @JustinTrudeau or are you waiting for Trump to give you permission @cafreeland
3744 2018-10-20 23:03:57 Sadly, Venezuela didn’t make these moves because things were going so well for them in the past, then the oil price crashed down & hasn’t & properly won’t recover again. But to blame it all on the government when these two massive factors are at play is simply flabbergasting.
3745 2018-10-20 23:03:56 Governments are corrupt as hell- all of them. We didn't punish the Saudis at all after discovering their role in 911. Do you really think the murder of one journalist is going to mean anything?! Saudis got the oil- we will continue to indulge them.
3746 2018-10-20 23:03:48 The Italian bread with oil and spices that you get at any Italian restaurant is better than the entree
3747 2018-10-20 23:03:43 Well not just that...oil has peaked.  That’s why the majority of billionaires & nations whose wealth is dependent on it are so desperate to drain every drop from the earth now...no matter the consequences to the planet.
3748 2018-10-20 23:03:39 Oil companies have been in AGREEMENT since the 80s. Get over it :)
3749 2018-10-20 23:02:57 I'm not settled about how I feel about the pipeline thing so it makes no sense for me to argue that, but are you honestly advocating buying oil from Saudi Arabia?
3750 2018-10-20 23:02:57 I know it’s overused but he’s creepy. Sorry.

He looks like the kind of shy creepy guy who has trouble getting girlfriends.

He’s the worst. He’s also Breitbart’s hall monitor
3751 2018-10-20 23:02:47 Absolutely spot on. Reason why similar nations worldwide, Saudi Arabia is a prime example, are working on ending their economic dependency on oil & one main export because if it struggles then your economy will tank & others can easily target you.
3752 2018-10-20 23:02:23 The one car my family relies on most is out of commission because I thought I'd try to repair an oil leak. Now I'll have to figure out how to get to a parts store and how I'm gonna afford to buy another part. Today isn't ending on a great note...
3753 2018-10-20 23:02:20 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund, until recently it had the publisher of the National Enquirer on its board, it has a mandate to support the oil companies and is actively working to introduce US style conservatism to Canada.
3754 2018-10-20 23:02:20 Why? You have to ask? You don’t think about the power of the Saudis to drive oil prices to $200 a barrel? Or that we hardly have moral high ground after Obama killed so many enemies and innocents with drone strikes?
3755 2018-10-20 23:02:08 who brought Chelsea to the light without mourinho Chelsea were like city before the oil money they were just an ordinary team
3756 2018-10-20 23:02:00 Do birth control pills cause/cure acne? Birth control pills may help some women control acne. The hormones in birth control pills can help block androgen hormones. Androgen puts oil glands into overdrive. Even if u take birth control pills, you'll still need a skincare routine.
3757 2018-10-20 23:02:00 There's definitely money/oil involved between Trump and Saudi Arabia.
3758 2018-10-20 23:01:43 I’m always scared to have it around Leo!! I love an air purifier with peppermint oil in it but scared of the affects on cats  need it

3767 2018-10-20 23:00:29 So you’re not denying that low oil prices & economic sanctions/blockades have left Venezuela in the mess they’re in? Thanks for agreeing!

3771 2018-10-20 23:00:07  Use lavender essential oil as perfume to help start the day with peaceful vibes
3772 2018-10-20 23:00:06 Infusing oil over the next 4 weeks
3773 2018-10-20 23:00:06 Trump doesn't really believe the Saudi Explanation is credible. He's lying again since he doesn't want to hold the Saudi Royal Family accountable. Totally Dishonest Trump. Doesn't he ever get tired of being a Snake Oil Salesman. Trump Can't be Trusted!
3774 2018-10-20 23:00:03 Conversation transcripts between Bill Clinton and American puppet Boris Yeltsin(policies dictated by USA reduced RUS GDP 1/2 and premature deaths of millions), USA and SK aimed to starve NK of resources it lacks oil and food in years before famine. Blame all NK, not US and SK 2/2
3775 2018-10-20 22:59:57 Time to lite that cigar up! #RollTide #12inarow #RockyFlop
3776 2018-10-20 22:59:37 Got my THC cartridge open, may as well use the oil so it won't go to waste
3777 2018-10-20 22:59:34 The chaos and rioting occurred for exactly the same reasons in the past as now: Cultural and systemic corruption, and it will continue on this cycle because it has oil and because of it's proximity to the world's cocaine producers.
3778 2018-10-20 22:59:28 Bomb businesses and oil companies, Republicans in general?
3779 2018-10-20 22:59:24 No , they get oil from Russia and Iran
3780 2018-10-20 22:59:16 We certainly do but I'm ok w/ the workers, in this case the players, getting their share instead of it all ending up in the owners pockets
3781 2018-10-20 22:59:00 Perhaps you need transplantation of brain
3782 2018-10-20 22:58:57 @GOATOpinion OIL FC INCOMING.
3783 2018-10-20 22:58:56 Trump soon be selling necessity of cuts to Medicare & Social Security for all retired persons, even the MAGAs. Wake up. He doesn’t have your back. It’s all been Snake Oil to lessen those fears he sold you on.
3784 2018-10-20 22:58:25 the fresh sea berry moisturizing face oil. it’s the best!!!
3785 2018-10-20 22:58:19 Baby oil dikasih nyawa gini nih
3786 2018-10-20 22:58:18 So apparently my coat smells like lavender oil and cinnamon incense....
3787 2018-10-20 22:58:09 How does a small town support not 1, but 2, gourmet olive oil stores?! Should I be “going gourmet” more often?
3788 2018-10-20 22:57:59 10/21:間に合え
3789 2018-10-20 22:57:30 Just think the Saudis is the only opec country the USA hasn't invaded or threatened to invade. Just think if the USA blamed Saudis for 911. The USA be buying its oil from Iran.
3790 2018-10-20 22:57:22 It certainly is, I add a bit of garlic and and italian seasoning to olive oil  and baste the steaks before throwing them directly onto the coals.  There is and excellent recipe on @devonwoodsmoke
3791 2018-10-20 22:57:16 Sinton is near Rockport/Corpus Christi. Maybe check some geography before you spew ignorance. 
Texas economy thrives because of oil/gas & the tech industries brought in by - LIBERALS!
You also have no clue about who is getting help these days. 70% are working poor due to min wage
3792 2018-10-20 22:57:02 Just played: Dem A Sprinkle Oil - Assassin
3793 2018-10-20 22:56:57 About economic blockade & oil prices being massive factors? Don’t think so. Chavez reformed Venezuela massively & it was down to the fact that they were able to sell so much oil so that fantastic reforms could be pushed through. Not the same climate for Maduro.
3794 2018-10-20 22:56:48 Our intel  community is 2nd to none. I’m not concern. It needs to be diplomacy at its finest. They have to be held accountable but the world can’t afford to pay $200 a barrel of oil. This admin is fully capable. It’s not BO. He’d go & kiss the hand of the prince.
3795 2018-10-20 22:56:47 I don't believe anything until I see it happen, @SocraticGadfly. But I know that Cruz will vote to kill the ACA, expand tax cuts, end women's rights, persecute immigrants, deny LGBTQ rights, and protect the oil industry. If I could vote in Texas, I'd vote Cruz out.
3796 2018-10-20 22:56:43 im working 55+ at an oil shop. no time for games round these parts
3797 2018-10-20 22:56:38 Life experiences: finding that you have applied too heavy a coat of charcoal face mask for it to properly dry and spending the next 20 minutes trying to scrape yourself clean like a seagull in an oil slick.
3798 2018-10-20 22:56:21 You don't help us protect our "values". You help the US maintain the geopolitical situation, and in exchange we get oil. Nothing more, nothing less. 
You don't even protect US values within your own borders. No free speech, abysmal freedom of religion. Dont you still have slaves?
3799 2018-10-20 22:56:15 Austerity measures are to do with the smart sanctions imposed on his country. They say they target the elite but it doesn’t it targets the people. Assad pulled out of the oil pipeline with the US he said it was a bad deal for Syria, he signed the Arab huma rights charter in 2007.
3800 2018-10-20 22:55:44 Gini saya mau tanya, kok beberapa orang ada yg tanya saya kalau gambar pakai baby oil gak, serius saya baru tau loh, emang bisa?

Cannabis cbd oil
3802 2018-10-20 22:54:57 Does US indictment of Russian oligarchs force them to bringhome? Win win for Russia

All but admitting to an unofficial Republican Russian United Peteostate: Alaska, Texas, Russia, offshore, Exxon etc. 

Russia won’t stop at $100 oil. In a country that size oil is the economy.
3803 2018-10-20 22:54:40 They like that kind of crazy, lying, free interactive, snake oil salesmans, show!  And, some get paid!
3804 2018-10-20 22:54:38 It probably smells like coconut oil, pink sugar and independence
3805 2018-10-20 22:54:35 that would be swell and all if @BernieSanders was a D E M O C R A T 
f-ck #Bernie and his snake oil tom-foolery
3806 2018-10-20 22:54:28 i just put oil in my hair #bleesed
3807 2018-10-20 22:54:20 ever heard of Utah Utes punk?
3808 2018-10-20 22:54:17 *Wash your beard daily. 
*Get a beard scrubber to keep the skin underneath clean. 
*Condition every other day. 
* Dont over oil your beard.
* Raw Shea Butter & Coconut oil are terrific softeners & conditioners. 
* During the day, splash a little water on the beard & comb it out.
3809 2018-10-20 22:54:11 #IWasMistakenWhen I believed my older brother. A colorful oil slick was in the driveway. 
"What is this?"
He looked at me sadly and intoned, "It's a dead rainbow."
3810 2018-10-20 22:53:58 Alcohol, fragrance, mineral oil
3811 2018-10-20 22:53:53 I guess that depends on if you prefer to help individual humans or humanity as a whole. Both have value, but one is a little more long term view than the other. I'd maybe do something to help with Utah's air quality, getting us off coal/oil, or accelerate humans on Mars.
3812 2018-10-20 22:53:53 So bad that such brutal killings are becoming the new normal. The Saudis are buying silence to this despicable act with their oil money and threats.
3813 2018-10-20 22:53:52 Turkey neck Nazi war criminal ha, hurricanes Michael and Florence messed up your stealing my crude oil HUH
3814 2018-10-20 22:53:48 You got enough OIL left to get the job done! #getTOit
3815 2018-10-20 22:53:46 Ahahhahaha those are Gringo Tacos.
3816 2018-10-20 22:53:36 Sharma has a history of supporting the ongoing dispossession of Palestinians from their lands - he also worked for Abbott when the govt cheated Timor out of it’s oil and gas wealth which went to the International Court of Justice.
3817 2018-10-20 22:53:21 seems like many other oil service stocks i follow - all just taking pretty nasty turns this week
3818 2018-10-20 22:52:53 here is how it works-so far everyone gets what he/she want;everything is super fine then... hence you look the other way when things is obviously wrong...the smart US in connival with saudi, keeps the oil price as low as heaven knows and the latter gets to make more visa-vise
3819 2018-10-20 22:52:21 And Saudi Arabia?  Oh yeah.  They have oil.  And buy condos.
3820 2018-10-20 22:52:18 If we allow them to continue to believe they are untouchable, who knows what's next. The world needs to send a united, clear message. Oil or not there are consequences for your unacceptable behavior.
3821 2018-10-20 22:52:16 when you get the wrong 10/40 oil not driving back mechanic get so personal move on man damn team work
3822 2018-10-20 22:52:16 No veo nunca mas un partido de boca en la Oil, cada vez que me siento ahí no gana boca la puta madre
3823 2018-10-20 22:52:08 Isn't life great! Never thought we'd be the largest oil producers! God is good!!
3824 2018-10-20 22:52:07 oil consumption is a national security issue, yes. however, it’s important to understand that many products other than fuel are made with petroleum. literally every piece of plastic. 

and Canada is our largest supplier of oil, fyi. not Saudi Arabia.
3825 2018-10-20 22:51:58 Let's just hope oil is not found there or some other commodity some greedy corrupt organisation would love to get there greedy little hands on to spoil a Virgin land
3826 2018-10-20 22:51:56 You know you’re hitting oil field country, when you see a billboard advertising a Rolex from Cristiani’s. 
3827 2018-10-20 22:51:53 The same thing happened to me :-( I just kept doing salt water rinses and the clove oil. tooth pain sucks and so do pain killers, I’m so sorry!
3828 2018-10-20 22:51:40 Nice to see that "snake oil" lives on.  Bet the author is sorry about that one.
3829 2018-10-20 22:51:37 S T O P passing the buck and whataboutism. 

Saudi is majority regressive, violent and treats women like cattle, average citizens like sheep, given allowances like children, based on mono-culture oil riches. Men are misogynist, immature, have master/slave ideology

“Adapt or die”
3830 2018-10-20 22:51:30 TRAITOR TRUMP SAID THE SAUDI'S DID NO WRONG IN ALLOWING THE JOURNALIST TO GET CUT UP AND KILLED , BECAUSE JARHEAD KUSHNER NEEDS THE SAUDI'S OIL FOR HIS LANCEMEN IN ISRAEL, SLEAZY MOTHER FUCKER AS ONLY THE TRUMPS CAN BE!
3831 2018-10-20 22:51:27 Other than money, oil, and geo-pol alignment, U.S. shares exactly 0 value with intolerant and terror-sponsering KSA. U.S. values much more aligned with Syria's but the country is poor, has no oil, and is not aligned with U.S. interests.
3832 2018-10-20 22:51:13 Yep. Have a look at Saudi-US oil&cash&investment arrangements over last half century. Mind boggling, not well known, terrifying.
3833 2018-10-20 22:51:09 We will NOT sell Saudi Arabia any oil.
3834 2018-10-20 22:50:51 Sam is right. Gas prices are below $3.00 a gallon in most of country and have been for years. With Trump unleashing U.S. oil exploration and fracking, expect low prices to stay. Demand is immense right now. Yet prices are stable.
3835 2018-10-20 22:50:36 Early power play opportunity for the Oil.
3836 2018-10-20 22:50:34 Iran has readily accessible oil if we play one country against the other...Politicians have tunnel vision.
3837 2018-10-20 22:50:04 Vitamin E and rose hip oil >>>
3838 2018-10-20 22:50:01 Mahdi forced oil minister to reverse decision on transfer of oil companies to national oil company...Mahdi doesnt have power to do that until he fully sits his full Govt...Abadi still hasnt picked a position in Mahdi govt, I hope he breaks the system there is no reversing that:)
3839 2018-10-20 22:50:00 But oil runs your car joe or would you rather walk.
3840 2018-10-20 22:49:59 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
3841 2018-10-20 22:49:56 Norway being europes largest oil producer, and supplies vast quantities of natural gas to UK to keep them powered. Norway knows oil and gas is needed for decades to come. They ain't dumb enough to ban exploration and damage investment, risk jobs and energy security.
3842 2018-10-20 22:49:48 You’re on the block...but the gossip from the room is that you have character probz...
3843 2018-10-20 22:49:48 you're making this up as you go along.... where did 5th oil money go 
3844 2018-10-20 22:49:48 “VEN is not a Socialist crisis, just like the economic crisis that occurred before Chavez came to power was not exactly a Capitalist crisis either, they’re both crises that stemmed from the lack of economic diversification from oil and the lack of foresight of the VEN leadership”
3845 2018-10-20 22:49:46 The Eisenhower and Mercer game. The other crossover game (Cambridge and Wilmington) is 1hr vs 30min respectively, so I could buy the location for them. Just seems like Franklin or Oil City would be a better option considering it would be about an hour for each of the four teams
3846 2018-10-20 22:49:45 You say this, Andrew, but fail to convey to your followers the truth about why Venezuela is in such a mess & it’s nothing to do with the government. It’s to do with oil prices being lower than they need (reliant on them) & that a US led economic blockade is placed on them.
3847 2018-10-20 22:49:41 Loved this wonderful market in Seville.
3848 2018-10-20 22:49:41 I’ve been on Lucas Oil’s field and performed 9 times now #dowhatyoulove
3849 2018-10-20 22:49:34 All the people bashing Patagonia for endorsing Rosen and Tester, you realize corporations buy politicians every day via lobbyists right? Oil, Big Pharma, Tobacco, Gun makers, etc. Patagonia just doesn’t do it in the dark.
3850 2018-10-20 22:49:18 Oil resources and strategic position.
3851 2018-10-20 22:49:15 Q2 & Q3 squeaked. 1st & last had oil. 
Now: LSU or Oregon at 7...hmmmm?
3852 2018-10-20 22:49:07 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
3853 2018-10-20 22:49:05 Shall I tell you?? It’s our oil, what will happen if our major source of income was taken from us?? The price of fuel would sky rocket and even the middle class won’t be able to sustain buying fuel, the economy will collapse as their would be no influx of cash nor that there is
3854 2018-10-20 22:49:02 Subhanallah ain’t funny
3855 2018-10-20 22:48:39 I like grapeseed oil a lot and I'm gonna try rosehip next. That one is supposed to be fantastic for your face

Oil, enamel paint on verso?
3858 2018-10-20 22:48:36 It is but it's not their fault. The imbalance between London & the rest is the route cause of this. People who want chance will accept any snake oil salesman's (yes Nigel that means you) that comes along and promises a better future. We need to fix the country & #brexit isn't it.
3859 2018-10-20 22:48:33 My blood is already 50% olive oil and 50% buca. Can’t go much higher without major health consequences

3863 2018-10-20 22:47:59 LOL I cut my hair off because I love to have a whole weekend for stuff instead of spending an entire day (when I had waist-length locs) on my hair. Or even half a day. Now, I clip my hair every six weeks, and brush for two minutes with coconut oil (if that long) daily.
3864 2018-10-20 22:47:46 Vitamin E oil is great for your skin. It keeps it looking young and plump!
3865 2018-10-20 22:47:45 Oil
3866 2018-10-20 22:47:42 There’s a curious connection between man and machine. Sometimes there are certain upgrades only I feel comfortable to apply to my MFE. It builds my connection to it. I enjoy the oil and grease if it means I can reach even higher—BACK OFF TODD. GOD.
3867 2018-10-20 22:47:32 Someone suggested that it is time for civil disobedience, protests on a massive scale, internationally, if we are to save the planet and the race. Fact is, the great granchildren of the oil billionaires will have to live in the same wasteland as the progeny of the poor. 5/
3868 2018-10-20 22:47:29 That’s his claim to fame, he botched the pipeline, $4.5 billion purchase with tax payers money, buying oil from Saudi, that makes sense.
3869 2018-10-20 22:47:28 Either that or keep invading the Middle East until it's bone dry of oil.
3870 2018-10-20 22:47:27 why is the House of Saud NOT a house divided?  because there is money to be made ... black gold, Texas tea.  well, that won't do.  KSA must be SHUNNED by a united global community.  there are other marketplaces for oil; make use of them.  even better, invest in alternate energy.
3871 2018-10-20 22:46:49 Fried breadfruit is it.
Especially fried with coconut oil and paired with a nice sauce.
3872 2018-10-20 22:46:48 Saudi Arabia the prince if you don’t want us to back out with oil deals with you .The U.S.A wants the body back alive with the Washington Post reporter. Since you say he’s not dead Prince turn him over alive . U.S.A. can go with other Energy resources we have the Technology .
3873 2018-10-20 22:46:37 Interesting tactics. Ie: Oil burning, Double Battery and Nitrous
3874 2018-10-20 22:46:29 That's why President Obama wanted other means of fuel instead of oil, isn't it?
3875 2018-10-20 22:46:18 Help us supply OBO the oil nah

3878 2018-10-20 22:45:59 bought an oil diffuser and ready to feel like a new person
3879 2018-10-20 22:45:55 Idk imma try the caster oil though and look into some other things. I was just gonna chop it off but I really don’t want to
3880 2018-10-20 22:45:51 HAHAHA...but awesome sauce is pricey 
3881 2018-10-20 22:45:34 Onion >> Olive Oil >> Eggs. Guess what im going through ? 
3882 2018-10-20 22:45:34 The recipe is super simple but I’m not a professional chef it’s just how I like making it! Basically I chopped up a hakaiido pumpkin potatoes and 2 onions and put them in the pot with just a little sunflower oil until the onions are caramelized
3883 2018-10-20 22:45:25 If the shoe fits....

Hahaha
3884 2018-10-20 22:45:17 Proper cbd oil is worth a go.
3885 2018-10-20 22:45:15 Oil & we get from arms sales.
3886 2018-10-20 22:45:12 No. It's not all Presidents. It's THIS president. Because he wants their MONEY. In the past it's been about oil and not rocking the boat. THIS is DIFFERENT!
3887 2018-10-20 22:45:05 Question why are we in the business of mass wholesale of weapons of war!  And why the fuck to Saudis! This is why we need to get off the fng oil!!!!
3888 2018-10-20 22:45:01 Well. Guilty as charged. 
3889 2018-10-20 22:44:54 1. You've just nationalisated oil & not taken into account any costs
2. You've decided to take a share of assets and applied them to an annual deficit, are you planning on selling them? What % of those assets are already in Scotland? 
Fantasy economics doesn't help
3890 2018-10-20 22:44:50 Try some lemon oil on your chest!
3891 2018-10-20 22:44:47 America is drunk on the Saudis oil, and we don’t won’t to mess up the arms deals.
3892 2018-10-20 22:44:46 I hate a "my check engine light is on so i wanna come in to get the oil change done" bitch.
3893 2018-10-20 22:44:45 I gave Oil paintings away for Christmas for years. Until Everyone was sick of it. I gathered this when I realized how many , except the smaller one's or those that went well with their decor. They said "your so talented" They had no Idea how many times I painted, wiped, painted,
3894 2018-10-20 22:44:43 An oil change
3895 2018-10-20 22:44:35 Oil tho
3896 2018-10-20 22:44:35 We need to remove all diplomatic ties to Saudi Arabia. 

Heavy sanctions.

Suspend any arms deals. 

Cut purchasing oil by half.

Pull any U.S troops and empty our embassy.
3897 2018-10-20 22:44:33 So you'll be aware every leader before him made the same mistakes regardless of their politics - over leveraging oil and corruption.
3898 2018-10-20 22:44:33 I got a fancy dry oil spray in a beauty box and love it. Anybody have a drugstore favorite?
3899 2018-10-20 22:44:27 I’m always the most hated!

3901 2018-10-20 22:44:16 I am for King Salman buying Manchester United, because football club culture and ethics have changed drastically. Oil rich States control successes and the press now. Academy, national talent, longevity of players and manager have all become old fashioned. For eg. ManCity, PSG.
3902 2018-10-20 22:44:13 Not long for me cause I was using the castor oil.
3903 2018-10-20 22:44:12 Welcome to Oil Country Kevin. Enjoy the game tonight.
3904 2018-10-20 22:44:00 Saudi response is complete and utter BS.  Human rights are not a thing in the House of Saud, judging from their spaz when Canada critiqued the arrests of protesters, and this vile assassination of a journalist critical of the Saudi leadership. Keep your oil and choke on it.
3905 2018-10-20 22:43:58 well its fat
butter's fat
if we're adding oil too might as well!
3906 2018-10-20 22:43:54 Why hybrid?

3909 2018-10-20 22:43:47 i love galkyd so much. i can use oil paint as a casual medium and make a new layer every day
3910 2018-10-20 22:43:35 @wolfblitzer would say but if we use hemp, a lot of people would lose their jobs in oil companies!
3911 2018-10-20 22:43:07 Kale, washed then stir fried in oil/butter and soy sauce, plus Chinese five spice powder. Chuck in some chilli spiced seeds (Tesco’s are good) and it’s a fab healthy meal.
3912 2018-10-20 22:43:06 Screw them.  Imagine the river of shit the world oil markets would be right now without fracking in the USA.
3913 2018-10-20 22:42:46 "They need us more than we need them," is a lot more opaque than the simple fact we are temporarily producing more oil than they are.  Her argument fails almost entirely by not addressing the complexities of the regions Shia versus Sunni issues.
3914 2018-10-20 22:42:43 Tried the brown butter mac and cheese with shallots. The flavor is 100% better, but I was too light with the flour and the sauce broke a bit (there was more oil than I expected)
3915 2018-10-20 22:42:40 You don't.  No politician willingly kills and industry and stream of tax income unless it produces oil.
3916 2018-10-20 22:42:36 You mean plant foods stripped of almost all nutrients, boiled in oil that is a result of plants having almost all nutrients taken from them, with a side of plants with almost all nutrients stripped and a long list of artificial (man made) ingredients added.
3917 2018-10-20 22:42:23 Not feeling so sweet currently..but atleast I smell good .. this new oil I got is everything
3918 2018-10-20 22:42:18 Not to brag but I can make people block me in real life.

3922 2018-10-20 22:41:50 You are my united states senator Have you sponsor a bill halt all arms sales to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  ? Or to stop buying their oil to eject saudi diplomats , bar travel . Or is this just a cheap shot?
3923 2018-10-20 22:41:38 Again maintenance and no significant plan to ensure generations to come have access to parks and clean ashore and water.  Every maintenance plan put forth has a cut to regulations on oil gas and coal.  How about investing in renewable energy and cleaner cars and factories?
3924 2018-10-20 22:41:12 Venezuela and the middle east must start producing oil to stop this Bullish Rise in oil Prices.
3925 2018-10-20 22:40:45 @SalVulcano and @BQQuinn have my legal and emotional permission to come into my room while I sleep and fist my ass using grandma oil as lubricant
3926 2018-10-20 22:40:35 First, forgot oil and the second batch wouldn’t bind. Plus I’m without a mixer and my tried and true recipe. Hope to secure both again soon, but in the meantime this was a lifesaver

3932 2018-10-20 22:39:27 “Hey Siri... 
is there an essential oil for acne?”
3933 2018-10-20 22:39:21 Sure Bro. Some pple take pleasure in slandering other tribes. You can't do that to my tribe. I'd definitely find something to hit you back with. Let's see who's really that good or bad... The worse they will say about the Benin's is witchcraft,  which apparently exists everywhere
3934 2018-10-20 22:39:19 Peppermint oil!!!
3935 2018-10-20 22:39:08 If I had a dollar for every time I saw an article about coconut oil being used as a cleanser and clearing up someones CYSTIC ACNE I’d have at least $20
3936 2018-10-20 22:39:02 The snake oil oozes from both of them. Like so many remainers Clegg, Major, Grayling etc etc.
3937 2018-10-20 22:39:00 How about your transparency with big oil. I’m just hearing about this and it makes me think twice about who I will vote for. Come clean.

3940 2018-10-20 22:38:22 Go covered in oil and checkered flags
3941 2018-10-20 22:38:15 Lmao 
3942 2018-10-20 22:38:14 It is not the 'plebs' we are shouting at because there are no 'plebs'. We are shouting at dishonest snake oil sellers like you. We are shouting at liars and charlatans, right wing ideologues and racists, the intolerant and the ignorant.
3943 2018-10-20 22:38:14 Democrat Politician's remind me of snake oil salesmen.
3944 2018-10-20 22:38:08 The US thirst for oil. US Foreign policy is based upon supply of resources and strategic coalitions to ensure its continuation.
3945 2018-10-20 22:38:07 try castor oil or vitamin E oil to make them regrow my friend did this her freshman year of high school but with a lash curler
3946 2018-10-20 22:37:56 If the powers-that-be in this country didn't figure out that the Saudi aren't our friends after 9/11, why would the death of a Saudi dissident change anything?  Oil companies and arms manufacturers set our foreign policy, not our politicians.

3948 2018-10-20 22:37:51 I picked up some cbd oil, daydrank, paid bills, and ordered new underwear. I’m feeling pretty efficient for someone who did not buy a new car as planned today.
3949 2018-10-20 22:37:43 Here's a thought! Unblock Iran, purchase their oil. Why should we rely primarily on Saudi oil? Yes, Saudi Arabia should be penalized. The deals with them aren't worth it.
3950 2018-10-20 22:37:38 Who else noticed that @APCNigeria was not serious about @NgrDecides2019 not until @atiku became the presidential candidate for @OfficialPDPNig

3957 2018-10-20 22:36:50 How about the 1.4 trillion-dollar tax giveaway now they want to come after Social Security y don't hear about ending oil subsidies stop paying for the offshoring of jobs the American taxpayer pays for corporations to take their jobs overseas they get tax rebate 4 the full cost
3958 2018-10-20 22:36:39 The new oil is health insurance
3959 2018-10-20 22:36:30 Cheers 
3960 2018-10-20 22:36:27 Don’t forget the people who process the food, transport, sell it in stores, companies develop seeds, oil workers who supply the fuel, factory workers who make equipment, workers who make the steel, everyone is important, banker who finances operation, accountant does the book
3961 2018-10-20 22:36:26 That is crap. MbS is the one pushing the transition away from oil, including cultural reform. Khashoggi wrote an article against the killing of bin Laden. He was a propagandist for the Muslim Brotherhood and previously a propagandist for the Royal family. He was an OpEd writer.
3962 2018-10-20 22:36:20 Girl lmao i was annoyed! Talkin bout “no it’s oil, it’s gonna do that”

3965 2018-10-20 22:35:45 CBD oil without THC is available online - it is prescribed for pain management.  100% CBD oil can be ordered from licensed cannabis providers with a medical document.
3966 2018-10-20 22:35:31 Ya know, a good wank wouldn’t be a bad idea either. Just get the lotion or oil and getnto work-

Simples !
3969 2018-10-20 22:35:06 Poliquin says if we vote for Golden, no one will be able to buy heating oil or gasoline.
3970 2018-10-20 22:35:01 Our leaders feed us the same stupid lines like we are a developing country yet Ethiopia that had civil war until 2000 leading to millions dead have achieved stable electricity through renewable means and try Nigeria the biggest oil supplier of Africa as a whole can’t achieve this
3971 2018-10-20 22:34:43 Imagine having your fingers cut off . Your screams go unanswered. Imagine screaming out for mercy. Let’s make a deal with ‘ OIL’ and destroy EARTH.   earth VS OIL. Who wins - you deciduous.
3972 2018-10-20 22:34:35 I'm so confused why the GOP supports a relationship with Saudi Arabia.  They(SA), hold us by the balls by controlling  oil pricing. 
Nationalist should be all in on cutting ties and supporting the use of alternative energy sources, solar and wind. 
Win win

3977 2018-10-20 22:33:40 We got fried wings and breasts, fried okra, Mac and cheese, French fries, and marijuana in bud and oil form.
3978 2018-10-20 22:33:28 @mikegapes tortuous and mealy mouthed defence of Saudi Arabia is shameful. Stop selling arms to this despicable regime. Stop buying oil from Saudi. They are not helping to defend the West, they are creating hatred and division.
3979 2018-10-20 22:33:28 Batmans been using baby oil on his face. Smooth, so smooth
3980 2018-10-20 22:33:26 I asked the oil man for some kush scented oil and he told me no  I wanted to go full on for this costume and he said no. Then gave me frankincense and myrrh 
3981 2018-10-20 22:33:24 They hate each other. Point blank. This is oil and water, crips and bloods, Michigan and Michigan State.
3982 2018-10-20 22:33:14 I just poured red wine on my asparagus for grill prep...meant to go for the olive oil.
3983 2018-10-20 22:33:10 This perceived lack of legitimacy makes them very paranoid. It's possible that some prince might be prepared to exact their pint of blood from MBS. It's a bizarro world but they seem to thrive thanks to plentiful quantities of high grade crude oil.
3984 2018-10-20 22:33:00 Which is why we need to drill our oil!!
3985 2018-10-20 22:32:47 I absolutely do not like the black castor oil one it got a lot of hype and I hated it
3986 2018-10-20 22:32:33 i’d get an oil change for my car

4010 2018-10-20 22:29:17 Exactly- I’m still reeling from the “never cook with olive oil unless you are a monster” opinion.
4011 2018-10-20 22:29:15 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
4012 2018-10-20 22:29:08 I’d rather be boiled in oil!
4013 2018-10-20 22:28:45 I love hemp oil

4016 2018-10-20 22:28:32 Just saying... I've known this for at least a decade, or longer... about the Bush's and the Bin Laden family connections with the Oil company.... thought it was common knowledge by now. Maybe do some research before posting in the future. There is apparently a lot you don't know!
4017 2018-10-20 22:28:30 #Canada will become the first large country to legalise weed for recreational use (#Uruguay did so in 2013). Canadians will be allowed to consume #cannabis and cannabis oil and to grow up to four plants at home.
4018 2018-10-20 22:28:30 Can't find DBC oil without THC anywhere in Canada, since all products offered have THC in them. It's available in US, coz it's not a psychotropic drug. @JustinTrudeau do something, this is stupid. DBC oil was legal & should still be. It's for pain management, not getting high.

4021 2018-10-20 22:28:04 The gain more income into this country requires investment and sale of oil/water and minerals. The TM pipeline? NG pipelines? Neither the Frderal or the provincial gov’ts seem to share any common goals.
4022 2018-10-20 22:27:55 Yo sup aydren, have you tried cbd oil? I use it for my anxiety and I also work for a company that sells it. If you would like to know more info just let me know.

4029 2018-10-20 22:26:27 Quick question. Who has put us as a country at the mercy of foreign oil, especially Saudi Arabian oil? Answer. Every single politician pushing a narrative about Trumps ties to them. If they truly want action against Saudi Arabia let's start drilling here in America tomorrow!
4030 2018-10-20 22:25:44 Come here. Cannabis oil in shops. My arthritic boss says brilliant.
4031 2018-10-20 22:25:41 Self care Saturday - long walk with pup, nice bath with a @lushcosmetics bath bomb, coconut face oil (@KopariBeauty duh), and now binge watching @MakingAMurderer while eating @TalentiGelato 
4032 2018-10-20 22:25:25 Oh no, not this again. Keep it in the ground. And by that, I don’t mean add dangerous chemicals to eject and replace precious oil that is meant to be in the Earth.
4033 2018-10-20 22:25:19 Strengthen petroSA's governance and they must have a PPP with SASOL to start exploring for oil in our oceans.  This will stop OPEC n the dollar from affecting our petrol price.  If the apartheid government could do it,  what's stopping u?
4034 2018-10-20 22:25:17 This is the third time today I’ve gotten into an argument about my car needing an oil change with my mom. She thinks I need her to hold my hand. No. You just have an over worked, underpaid kid who doesn’t have a day off or the money to do an oil change.

4038 2018-10-20 22:24:56 Look, pundits - just be honest and say we are allies with the despicable Saudi monarchy because of realpolitik, and oil, and all the money they throw at us.  Don't pretend we have any sort of morality.

4040 2018-10-20 22:24:50 It's all about Jared's friendship and the money they plan to make off all of that oil money. And his cult won't care because they will be seeing song in the whole mobs in jobs thing instead like the idiot Lemmings they are
4041 2018-10-20 22:24:39 Turn out @FIATofaustinTX will charge you for things they didn’t even do. Thanks for not rotating and refilling my tires. You also didn’t update the oil change sticker information, so I assume you didn’t do that either.

4044 2018-10-20 22:24:18 Dear Santos,
I have friends and relatives in this area. I witnessed the fruitless search for oil in the 70s. I would rather pay more for my gas than see the Pillaga despoiled by fracking.
POQ, and don't forget to shut the door after you leave.
Thank you. Dr Jules.
4045 2018-10-20 22:24:17 Great article. Silence on $ bonds is bewildering. Does he risk messing credit rating in a rising rate environment should he shore up ILFS?Using Rupee for Oil will never work.  Frankly the erosion of mcap has to be viewed in context of hugely inflated PE’s earlier of these NBFC’s
4046 2018-10-20 22:24:15 @johnelway is doing political ads against #Prop112 He has No problem with Big Oil fracking next to your house and next to your kids school. Our environment is more important then your car dealership!

4047 2018-10-20 22:24:10 Income inequality is largely the result of deficit spending by a government that prints money on a whim and pays back its debt with cheaper dollars. Asset inflation (real estate, oil, gold, art) is how the rich offset the loss of the dollar’s purchasing power. You make it worse
4048 2018-10-20 22:24:07 Halting the sale of the armored vehicles will not hurt Saudi as countless other countries could sell them the same thing. If Canada wants to hurt them we should become energy independent and get our oil on the world market and hurt them competitively.
4049 2018-10-20 22:24:04 I wanted to check my cars oil today come to find out theres a damn rabbits nest inside my engine bay 
4050 2018-10-20 22:24:03 What's this alternative renewable oil you speak of? Can diesel engines run on it?
4051 2018-10-20 22:24:02 If you're too stupid to understand how and why the US is trying to destabilise the country with a view to taking control of its oil, the largest global reserves known, there's little point in me not muting you... 
4052 2018-10-20 22:23:59 Yeah the growth oil work od I’m still bald cause I’m too lazy 
4053 2018-10-20 22:23:46 I had a 351windsor and had to clean out the oil returns annually because they clogged.

He is in 100% with a sexual predator and backed a pedophile as well as into climate  denial all he wants is coal and oil like an old fossil he sucks up the spoils
4064 2018-10-20 22:21:35 I 100% agree.  When I ask people to invest in my films, I compare it to roulette.  I would rather than be honest and a snake oil salesman.  It would be easy to take advantage of people's dreams, but I could not live with myself.
4065 2018-10-20 22:21:31 That is the same in any rural country right across the world,,,, oh except Norway. They have a £7T fund from oil. Oh who spent ours, both @labour and @TheTories23. Maybe if you had voted for Indy in 79 you would have a full services hospital in Wick.

4084 2018-10-20 22:19:32 Your country is a blight on humanity. The world would be better off without the Saudi regime. I weep for the future, when all of the oil is depleted or unnecessary and all of you go back to throwing rocks at neighboring tribes.
4085 2018-10-20 22:19:28 True. Apparently American media deemphasized MBS genocide there for so long in favor of keeping the oil route from Saudi through the Bab el Mandab clear. It’s said that the media jumped on the Khashoggi story because KSA was going to buy S-400’s from Russia
4086 2018-10-20 22:19:09 Wlh kuma babu ranar gamawa.. innocent lives are being killed everyday in Yemen and world is silent about it cos of Saudi oil and dollars.. Wani lokaci kudi masifa ne
4087 2018-10-20 22:19:02 Keep in mind that Subscribe and Save subscription services (saves 5% on all recurring orders when signing up) are a great way to make CBD oil purchases budget friendly, and plan for the future!

4092 2018-10-20 22:18:55 I si és "they took it in the oil party [...]". "Lo llevaron a la fiesta del aceite". Fiestuki d'oli... 
4093 2018-10-20 22:18:47 I'm down but I doubt the govt will hurt the oil industry in Canada.
4094 2018-10-20 22:18:47 Put coconut oil for top and bottom lashes! It helps to make them longer! It works on eyebrows too!
4095 2018-10-20 22:18:43 So it individual differences
4096 2018-10-20 22:18:38 #kashoggi. Maybe the west should dust off its policies of a military expedition to take over the Saudi oil fields by force, to ensure the wests continual supply of oil. Theyve made enough money.
4097 2018-10-20 22:18:32 $3,000 Worth of Wesson Oil?
4098 2018-10-20 22:18:21 Try Pasta Aglio e Oglio: cook pasta Al Dente. In pan, add EVOO, heat up, add chopped fresh garlic, before it browns add the pasta, stir it up to get the garlic pieces mixed with the pasta and the flavored oil all over the pasta. Serve w/ bit of parsley and plenty of grated Parm
4099 2018-10-20 22:17:55 That is the biggest contradiction I have ever heard. We need the oil even if it’s from the devil, but we have plenty 
4100 2018-10-20 22:17:50 @realDonaldTrump 
$110B with of military orders from Saudi takes about 7 years to accrue as their income is about $200B+ right now.  
They can only afford about $15B per year unless something dramatic happens to oil prices. 
$450B takes almost 30 years to get that much orders.
4101 2018-10-20 22:17:38 Alright. We ALREADY have the money for a renewable alternative oil. So why continue to use oil? Global warming is thing! Just because we got money from oil doesn't mean we STILL need it.

4108 2018-10-20 22:16:59 @POTUS Mr. President, if you demand for Prince Bin Salman steps down and for Khashoggi’s murderers to be executed, many Americans will be proud of you come Election Day. We do not sell our dignity or our souls in exchange for jobs or cheap oil. It’s the right thing to do.
4109 2018-10-20 22:16:53 They carry a zero-THC oil
4110 2018-10-20 22:16:44 Why are we still doing business with these ass holes. 15 of their home grown terrorist killed over 3000 of our people on 9/11. We don’t need them! We have enough oil and gas between Mexico, Canada and the US to supply our needs!
4111 2018-10-20 22:16:42 But I think you can get b12 from fish oil pills. But still I never had to personally take those

4113 2018-10-20 22:16:41 @Chevron I saw a service that involves exploitation for the extraction of oil in Ecuador. I think that you are absolute criminals, like many other oil companies, for example our loathsome Eni!

4121 2018-10-20 22:16:04 CBD oil I saw on Canadian websites all had quite a bit of THC in it. I don't want THC, that the active stuff to get high. DBC used to be legal, a nutritional supplement (no psychotropic effect), now it has fallen into a crack in the new system. #cdnpoli

4132 2018-10-20 22:15:02 I use a little coconut oil, some honey and raw sugar. But most other people use just the oil and sugar
4133 2018-10-20 22:14:59 still got no idea what to do with the infused coconut oil. fuk
4134 2018-10-20 22:14:53 There wouldn't be without oil.
4135 2018-10-20 22:14:49 I should be asking u why Dangote refinery is not situated in Bayelsa or Akwa-Ibom 'close' to d crude?
Maybe u don't know that the United States has d largest number of refineries in d world yet none of them is 'close' to any source of crude oil bcos they don't have a single drop!
4136 2018-10-20 22:14:48 Got my baby’s oil changed, grabbed some cafecito, watched a little Netflix, gonna do laundry, and then just thinking of smoking a joint while enjoying some beach views later today  solo tings 
4137 2018-10-20 22:14:43 I'm not sure if the chicken thighs I cooked are delicious or if I just really like lots of salt and garlic powder and olive oil.
4138 2018-10-20 22:14:39 Pastors are snake oil salesmen who get a tax break on their scam.
4139 2018-10-20 22:14:34 Saudi Arabia is not our ally. They give us nothing that we don't already have., We don'tneed their oil, we have plentry of our own. We don't need their blood money for weapons to kill other people, we don't need to sell them any more airpalnes, they can buy them from someone else

4151 2018-10-20 22:12:54 Crazy.  The media should report exactly which countries are supplying oil to eastern Canada - Saudi Arabia, Libya, Venezuela Iraq?  This is insanity when the west sits upon billions of barrels of oil, but can't transport it.
4152 2018-10-20 22:12:43 Lol.... This tweet is not an opinion to @Blackdot_mandy discourse!
4153 2018-10-20 22:12:37 Perhaps a nice spoonful of some saturated fat like butter or coconut oil too.
4154 2018-10-20 22:12:37 #BreakingNews.  'Haj' Salman of #SaudiArabia and his 'kid' Mohamed decided to release power to the public.  So Saudi Arabia will be named 'Hijaz' country and all the oil money in their Western private accounts that stolen from the country will be returned

4164 2018-10-20 22:11:38 Yeah and oil isn't worth much in this world. Just ask Saudi Arabia. Venezuela is collapsing because of socialism. The same path every socialist country eventually takes.
4165 2018-10-20 22:11:35 In reality it doesnt matter.
None of them have an inherent right to come anyway.
4166 2018-10-20 22:11:12 Isee

4169 2018-10-20 22:11:00 I’m looking forward to the time we don’t need their oil or resources. The quicker we can get to an economy where their oil is worthless, the better.
4170 2018-10-20 22:10:42 Is motor oil on the banned substance list? Is this a failed test?

4174 2018-10-20 22:10:31 Thanks, but I don't want to get high on THC. Since the new law came into effect, a product which was legal - CBD oil, without THC - seems to have fallen into a black hole. It now available everywhere - France, US, Swiss - but not in Canada. #cdnpoli
4175 2018-10-20 22:10:29 In as long as the Saudi oil and billion dollar investments are flowing into the US, the US President won't care how the Saudis treat their citizens.

4189 2018-10-20 22:08:32 Ur mcm uses bio oil on his face as moisturiser.
4190 2018-10-20 22:08:31 When is your scheduled oil change? Lol.

4193 2018-10-20 22:08:11 Of course they are.
#SaudiArabia  is a dictatorship. 
One of the most cruel in the world.
Great buddies of the West though: they've got oil.... and they have lots of money to buy weapons  (#USA #UK #FRA...).

これは期待しかないですね！
4197 2018-10-20 22:07:05 I wish the oil would run out for that lot and they need to go back to selling carpets and rugs!!
4198 2018-10-20 22:07:04 it would be nice if my #MCAS would allow me to eat vegetarian food since I'm allergic to beef and chicken right now, but I can't eat beans, rice, seeds, fermented foods, mushrooms, most vegetable oil or most vegetables :/
4199 2018-10-20 22:07:02 Started my dogs on coconut oil today! Yay! Ready to see some improvements!
4200 2018-10-20 22:06:54 We are living the 2 arguments here in Alberta with a year to next election... choice of slash and burn conservative government creating infrastructure deficit by reducing budget deficit  or NDP with higher taxes and oil price dependent fiscal deficits...
4201 2018-10-20 22:06:52 Depends on where you stayed on BENIN but that doesn't mean we are not nice and accommodating! 

Cheers
4202 2018-10-20 22:06:46 Looking at all energy experts including hubberts curve by 2050 there should start to be significant oil constraints and we may actually see far fewer air flights
4203 2018-10-20 22:06:29 The Saudi's are more trouble than they r worth.Saudi controlled Kuwait was the reason for Iraq & 9/11 because of the oil,power & $$$ The USA &SaudiArabia r using eachother for mutual advantage, namely the petro-dollar.And look what happened next! @POTUS
4204 2018-10-20 22:06:22 Do you understand what happens to the world economy (including the increased  cost of gas you put in your car) if Trump pisses off the Saudi king? Saudi can use oil as an IMMEDIATE (as in tomorrow)  weapon to retaliate against any sanctions imposed on them that they feel unjust.
4205 2018-10-20 22:06:18 Since we depend on tourism here in FL, we cannot risk oil spills.
4206 2018-10-20 22:06:13 I didn't understand how you could play with the Ghisou hair oil in a food place--the renowned Angelina no less. 
4207 2018-10-20 22:06:02 Also, shale oil is much more expensive. Looking purely at production is almost missing the point.
4208 2018-10-20 22:05:58 Bad internet makes me wanna guzzle motor oil
4209 2018-10-20 22:05:58 Am I the only one that feels hella good after I get a oil change for the whip lol
4210 2018-10-20 22:05:52 Canada needs to put an end to importing Saudi oil as well. It's called blood oil for a reason. The same reason we need to end the arms deal. It gives strength to the human rights abuses. Are we serious about this or not? If we play deaf, we only encourage the abuses.
4211 2018-10-20 22:05:45 MV公開は可能性大ですね！

4216 2018-10-20 22:04:57 Who? I remember one that brought oil to east coast but haven’t heard of much since. What are they thinking?
4217 2018-10-20 22:04:51 I used to think #cbdoil was snake oil for hippies but it really works to alleviate pain

Y'all are gonna be responsible for the binge as soon as this oil heats up. 
4220 2018-10-20 22:04:28 Probably you have bad intentions towards them...  

Cheers
4221 2018-10-20 22:04:19 Dmitriev said the RDIF has been working with Chinese entities to facilitate their participation in the IPO. Russia and Saudi Arabia have put aside rivalry to forge an international agreement on curbing oil production to bolster the market after a three year price downturn.
4222 2018-10-20 22:04:04 Do the corporations get anything in return for the money?  If not, do you suppose that some may consider leaving Florida or reconfiguring their operations to avoid the tax. Look South, Hugo Chavez did the same thing to Venezuela’s oil industry which now lies in ruins. Marxist.
4223 2018-10-20 22:03:54 The man has made it very clear he wants to get rid of Medicare and it’s a fact he has no loyalty to social security.

4227 2018-10-20 22:03:41 There is something so slimey about him... Like a snake oil merchant.... 'can you see the magic now... Thersea'
4228 2018-10-20 22:03:18 It's hard to make time for it, particularly as much as you are on the go. But the past is the past, & you're on-board now. Also, let me send you some of these awesome lemon essential oil sanitizing towelettes to use on the plane now that I think of how much you have to travel :)
4229 2018-10-20 22:03:14 Such an idiotic comment?   Even if they are amoral? We have much more oil supplies? Try to make sense of this B.S.!
4230 2018-10-20 22:03:13 He’s done a deal with the Saudis, if they lower the oil price he will let it go.

4234 2018-10-20 22:02:44 hi Steven .Do you export your olive oil? can you tell me what types do you produce and in what ways? and how much do you sell it for commercially ?Thanks

4237 2018-10-20 22:02:33 Maybe use that influence to ask them to stop torturing journalists to death?  I know it sounds crazy since they have oil.
4238 2018-10-20 22:02:32 Agreed Eddie.
This is selective outrage, nothing more by the MSM.
Saudi’s are not only a big military “customer” of ours but also a giant pipeline of intel in an area of the world we have NEVER understood.  And let’s not forget the elephant in the room...OIL
4239 2018-10-20 22:02:30 Making fries with oil is cool an all but have you ever made fries with butter

Make America great again over human rights and human flesh @washingtonpost
4243 2018-10-20 22:01:49 Trust is not the issue. Of course we don't trust them. The issue is murder. MBS has to go and until he does our relationship with Saudi Arabia must be put on hold. And we need to wean ourselves away from relying on their oil. A clean energy push is a necessary component of that
4244 2018-10-20 22:01:42 Wonderful

4248 2018-10-20 22:00:55 I agree bet on shale is dumb. I think authors of Energy Dominance doctrine know that even if White House doesn't. But IMHO $ peg to oil caused FX move vs China & EMs alike. This isn't visible to White House: if it were they wouldn't be accusing China of currency manipulation
4249 2018-10-20 22:00:33 CBD oil is expensive, almost prohibitively so.
4250 2018-10-20 22:00:30 Higher oil prices also help Putin.

4257 2018-10-20 22:00:10 They should be separate votes because they're unrelated. Offshore oil & gas drilling causes a completely unique (& worse) set of issues than vaping.

4261 2018-10-20 21:59:54 I find it really disappointing that Linda McCartney sausages use palm oil in the ingredients- totally unnecessary 
4262 2018-10-20 21:59:46 It’s just a guess tho. 

Maybe it just supply & demand. Oil has so many uses. We should probably look into renewable energy #RenewableEnergy
4263 2018-10-20 21:59:20 Y'know. I'm tired of you bitching and moaning about everything. Do you hate being a fan of cars too? We get a good amount of our oil from Saudi Arabia too so maybe you should just walk from now on. All you ever do about everything is whine and moan and tweet out about how everyon

4286 2018-10-20 21:55:15 coconut oil won't fix this.
4287 2018-10-20 21:55:13 I found CBD infused Sour Patch Watermelons. I would eat one before bed and I would actually have a good nights sleep. It takes away pain and calms the nerves. I would 100% recommend CBD oil
4288 2018-10-20 21:54:36 Not sure what their gun laws are.  Palestinians have due process when they are arrested.  And Iran is a terrorist country who is in Syria, Yemen etc positioning arms on Israel and Yemen’s border.  Iran wants to control the straights preventing oil from moving in the ME
4289 2018-10-20 21:54:22 Liberal Europe needs oil. Does anyone think they care about a journalist ROFLMAO.

4301 2018-10-20 21:52:24 "heat the oil to slowly liquify it"

guess SOMEONE doesn't know the difference between fats and oils

at room temperature (or slightly below that) oils are liquid where as fats are solid

Should probably know that when you're running a food Blog

We the people pay those athletes AND owners.
4313 2018-10-20 21:50:11 @WBrettWilson  which oil refineries use the #saudi oil. I’d love to stop shopping at those gas distributors. I don’t care if fuel prices jump to $2.50/l. Tired of making those fkers richer. Time to #ShopLocal

Why isn't the oil in the existing TransMountain pipeline going overseas to fetch this supposedly better price?

With DOMINANT influence petro$$ set the price of oil in U.S. $$ & led to many Middle East countries pegging their currency to the U.S. $$
4328 2018-10-20 21:47:47 sugar free Red Bull tastes like motor oil
4329 2018-10-20 21:47:38 Just had to go get an oil change with my dad. The guy workin on he car forgot to grab a paper and the only response he gave was “Dangit Bobby!” 

Day made
4330 2018-10-20 21:47:33 Keep the greedy GOP....it's all about corporate power. Big oil, Trump's "clean coal" and natural gas fracking. Follow the money trail & fu*k the environment. They just don't give a damn about their children, grandchildren & the future generations. That's what this is about.
4331 2018-10-20 21:47:31 Trump is doing a great job.  At least hes not selling us out like obama n hillary.  Bush had 9/11 done and bought his oil from the Laden's. U all 2 busy watching edited  fake instead learning #truth
4332 2018-10-20 21:47:22 Oil it! Oil it up! 
4333 2018-10-20 21:47:09 @Asad_Umar As you said today at @FPCCIOfficial that our biggest import is oil than why not promote cycling as commute and abolish import duty .
4334 2018-10-20 21:47:07 What the corporations will tell you.... I go with a groupon to get an oil change and am told i need new brakes to the tune of 1400 but I find Legacy Auto and Mohammed Rashid and the job was done for less than half
4335 2018-10-20 21:47:04 Saudi has a lot of power no doubt. They could cripple a lot of nations by cutting off oil
4336 2018-10-20 21:47:01 I almost wish it wasn’t digital. I feel like it would be so much more impressive and appropriate for the game for it to have been an actual oil on canvas.
4337 2018-10-20 21:46:59  nigga said change his oil lmao
4338 2018-10-20 21:46:59 Saudi are isis lite - an evil oil drenched empire
4339 2018-10-20 21:46:44 My Ulta only ever got two @chrissyteigen body oil glitters. One is a tester & the other I own. I just still feel super lucky to own a piece of my idol
4340 2018-10-20 21:46:42 I think the “betting on shale” geopolitical power move is as dangerous/misguided as the “we’ll liberate Iraq & free up all that oil infrastructure & growth potential” circa 2003. ..US 2yr rates moved above Chinese 2yr, IMO this changed global currency/growth dynamics since summer
4341 2018-10-20 21:46:40 By cleaning the toilet? Got any sisters?
4342 2018-10-20 21:46:40 got some palmers brand coconut oil lip balm we’re enjoying
4343 2018-10-20 21:46:39 No, no he has NOT. He also never paid a dime out of the Trump Foundation to charity. He sure did write a check out of his CHARITY FOUNDATION for a 6' oil painting of HIMSELF though, in the amount of $10,000. All the money DONATED to the Trump Foundation was spent by him, on him..
4344 2018-10-20 21:46:37 Love seeing Nellie, please have more people who see through two-party false choices.

Even in a country promising to be a "climate leader", Canada's EDC is STILL supporting oil and gas projects -- count on us to miss the 2-degree target unless we turn the system upside-down!
4345 2018-10-20 21:46:05 Did you take note of all the FALL GUYS lining up in Saudi Arabia? And Salman insisting that he's an angel?
Man,he must be so..sure that Americans are gullibles.Are you?
Look at the leverage they have.Their oil,Arms deal,Trump's business deals.America is beaten!
4346 2018-10-20 21:45:55 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
4347 2018-10-20 21:45:41 Of course, the military client has far more power than the oil supplier
4348 2018-10-20 21:45:39 Say it ain't so, Will!
4349 2018-10-20 21:45:15 uwu //.\\ j-jiffy lube san ;-; change my wittle oil ‿ oniii chan (╯3╰)
4350 2018-10-20 21:45:15 Are we supposed act surprised that the Saudi Royal Family is capable of this? This is the same bunch of dirtbags that tried to destroy our country with the Oil Embargo. We should have pulled our heads out of our asses 45 years ago, and left the House of Saud to face their people.

4352 2018-10-20 21:45:02 The perfect lightning and coconut oil
4353 2018-10-20 21:45:00 How do people who oil paint like... do it??? This is stressful
4354 2018-10-20 21:44:49 This is just an official statement but without power. Is the EU that weak? I miss the words #sanction and #boycott but there is so much money and oil involved!
4355 2018-10-20 21:44:48 hahaha they don't want our oil. They love our oil because we can only bring it to one destination, so they can charge us whatever the heck they want and make a HUGE spread on the refining margin. the current pipeline is only 300k bpd and most of that goes to California.
4356 2018-10-20 21:44:44 We know that there's no "motor oil" involved 
4357 2018-10-20 21:44:31 The quirks of oil pricing? Are you serious? Do you have any idea how much this country loses each year because of idiots that block pipelines and want to live with windmills?
4358 2018-10-20 21:44:30 No his strategy is very simple people in southern or western libya will join him eventually the GNA is weak with no power at all the only real opposition is Misrata and they were tested against the the LNA lost multiple times hence 2015 2016 oil attacks
4359 2018-10-20 21:44:30  I’ll wear my xtratuff boots and smear fish oil all over my clothes...

4362 2018-10-20 21:44:08 I hate the “healthier” ones with oil on the top. Why they gotta do that?

4364 2018-10-20 21:44:04 Anything will do for financial leverage of an oil rich state.
4365 2018-10-20 21:44:04 Rob McKenna represents Chevron Oil -- but his ads against a carbon fee don't disclose that ‘minor’ detail. Take these dishonest ads down @Kiro7Seattle @komonews @Q13Fox @KING5Seattle #waelex

4367 2018-10-20 21:43:46 Oil Boom Drives North Dakota Production to Record Levels...
4368 2018-10-20 21:43:46 They won't do anything about the Saudi's because it is more that arms deals & a place for rendition of people they want torture is also about fixing #Oil prices with agreement of the OPEC group
4369 2018-10-20 21:43:31 Instead of attacking POTUS Trump why don't these journalists go to a BOARD MEETING AT AN OIL EXEC LOL   CHICKENS
4370 2018-10-20 21:43:30 Of course they are. Osama Bin Laden was saudi, The Saudis have never been out friend we need them for oil. We look away for them bc we need them
4371 2018-10-20 21:43:22 latest research shows that by consuming more healthy unsaturated fats, such as coconut, avocado, olive oil, fish, nuts and seeds, not only do we feel satiated longer, but our systems also gets busy stimulating the fat-burning process within our bodies.
4372 2018-10-20 21:43:20 y’all don’t think it’s kinda FOWL how @dawn dishwashing soap uses baby ducks covered in crude oil and how their product saves them to further sell their dish soap ?
4373 2018-10-20 21:43:20 I used eco styler gel and olive oil hairspray fully banged. Just plain gel works for me and my frontals... the most id do is use got2glued spray sometimes
4374 2018-10-20 21:43:12 Od course not. What rubbish! A tyranny that has an abysmal human rights record, no freedom of speech, no freedom of expression. A country that should be marginalised but the West grovels before their oil and money.
4375 2018-10-20 21:43:03 Yes. Even china not building the real curling rink but using the oil to pretend as ice in Beijing. Also it is all new event in Suzhou , Chonqing and Qinghai. Those cities don’t have real curling ice and facilities. And China try to promote the sports around the country.
4376 2018-10-20 21:43:02 Energy East was an export pipeline. The refineries are not equipped to handle heavy oil.

Why don't they just buy oil from Nfld instead?
4377 2018-10-20 21:43:00 There is WORK to be done in this country.  The old oil economy is waning.  The ARISTOCRATS (Don, D jr, Jared,Vlad, Waltons,Kochs,Betsy D,MBS,Xi,Un) will NOT make the decisions (genetic engineering, CRISPER, ecological collateral damage).

Humanity Votes and is ENFRANCISED. #CNN
4378 2018-10-20 21:42:40 Is Will actually a Millenial! He looks a little old!
4379 2018-10-20 21:42:40 One of several things I would do is start a fund to help get a Democratic Secretary of State in all 50 states who would encourage participation in elections.

Then invest heavily in the renewable energy field, just to piss off oil and utility companies.
4380 2018-10-20 21:42:34 We don’t need no prosperity pimps or a snake oil salesmen leading the church into spiritual idolatry or down a primrose path of destruction - we just need people preaching the gospel! #JustSawAVideo #PreacherPreach
4381 2018-10-20 21:42:20 Beto is bad for Texas he plans on shutting down oil and coal production, open borders, letting illegals by the hundreds of thousands into the country and taking money from hard working Texans to pay for them. Businesses will suffer with an undue tax burden.
4382 2018-10-20 21:42:09 Super simple recipe! Happy to share. Half a bulb of crushed garlic on a decent wok oil (pre-infused with ginger), chicken drumsticks and bone in thigh, browned, then some turmeric, Black pepper & Marigold stock. Cook until the meat falls off the bones... x
4383 2018-10-20 21:42:05 What you're saying is so true. The option is to throw in the towel ... not acceptable. You celebrate the victories and keep fighting for justice. The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
4384 2018-10-20 21:42:03 maybe after this your V.C would donate 1 carton of indomie,one bottle of oil,with 3 tissue paper for yall
4385 2018-10-20 21:41:59 Are you ok with actors being paid what they are Kris, as it really is the same thing. Also, it's the owners making the big $$$ not the athlete. Right or wrong, going after that entertainment dollar is where it's at. With that said, you are not wrong Allison, it really is a shame.
4386 2018-10-20 21:41:29 ゆきとさんおはごですー！
4387 2018-10-20 21:41:18 The difference between oil and dollars? We can run out of oil.
4388 2018-10-20 21:41:17 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
4389 2018-10-20 21:41:16 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4390 2018-10-20 21:41:15 @IkejaElectric what is wrong with the four hours daily???
4391 2018-10-20 21:40:54 Not true. I worked for years in hotels and one of the worst tipping groups we ever had was an oil and gas convention. Doctors and airline pilots were right behind them in the stingy tipping department. There are good and bad tippers in all political stripes.
4392 2018-10-20 21:40:47 ya mcm can’t do an oil change 
4393 2018-10-20 21:40:45 Also, what have I done to deserve this?
4394 2018-10-20 21:40:33 Deep state wants another Mideast crises. Oil prices go thru roof.  World economy plummets. Looking to blame Trump.
4395 2018-10-20 21:40:30 Kashoggi was not a supporter of bin Laden. He was an envoy of KSA sent to persuade bin Laden to chill. Google it. And yes the economy will take a hit if MBS stays put but it will accelerate the transition away from Saudi oil.
4396 2018-10-20 21:40:28 ナルルちゃーん、俺の机ちょっと片付けて…くれないよねー
4397 2018-10-20 21:40:23  I thought it was just me... The oil on my own face will be enough to fry chin chin
4398 2018-10-20 21:40:19 Oh dear. You really have been brainwashed. 
It cannot be argued that the vote to leave has not affected us economically. The hit to the pound has increased oil prices (as they are bought with USD). 
For the first time since the end of rationing we have a Food Supplies Minister
4399 2018-10-20 21:40:10 음 이따 그림그려야 하는데 잘것같아
4400 2018-10-20 21:40:10 Maybe not a product specific testamonial but something to change the way CBD oil is perceived. It's a game changer for a lot of people..

4403 2018-10-20 21:40:03 I am capitalism and my anatomy is the anatomy of a monster, I breathe fire, I consume oil, I tinker with your pretty brains.
4404 2018-10-20 21:39:50 I cannot wait to be off Monday. I need to wash my hair and deep condition and do a hot oil treatment. My scalp is itchinggg
4405 2018-10-20 21:39:43 How does an oil change take 2 hrs
4406 2018-10-20 21:39:41 I'm just here waiting for my car to have it's oil change and Believe It or Not starts playing. And I remember @TobiBennington saying that this was Chester's favorite song. Awww, I can picture him dancing around and singing so happily.

4408 2018-10-20 21:39:40 We had our very first olive oil tasting right here in our store today! Our participates were pleasantly surprised at the difference in a good EVOO!

4410 2018-10-20 21:39:30 In most countries, committing a botched rendition of a journalist, followed by an assassination, and then a botched response to the assassination involving lying would be grounds for imprisonment and replacement. But I guess Saudi Arabia gets a special pass because oil.
4411 2018-10-20 21:39:22 I take care of myself naturally. here are some tips for you girls cuz self love 
If you have dry hair, 
use olive oil & coconut oil, mix in your hair to soak for as long as you want
Dark underarms? Lemon & baking soda turn into a paste.
Keep 10 mns & rinse
4412 2018-10-20 21:39:19 My skin has been extremely dry this week, so I added a coconut, vitamin e, tea tree oil moisture to my routine and I am so shiny. I LOOK HOLOGRAPHIC!!
4413 2018-10-20 21:39:12 When they say "extremist parties", they mean parties that actually want to take steps towards reducing the impact of climate change. Anything that isn't pro- oil, pro-war, pro-unfettered capitalism, is labeled extremist in our political climate.
4414 2018-10-20 21:39:01 You’re not allowed to film outside the Saudi embassy is Washington DC. They effectively own 10% of America due to the way oil is traded. They will do want they want and the world will do nothing, which is an utter disgrace #riseup
4415 2018-10-20 21:38:58 Any chance of making a medicated Hot Ones Hot sauce? I'd imagine i'd have to be a hot oil base considering THC only binds to fats but I bet id'e be amazing
4416 2018-10-20 21:38:57 Put things into perspective. If the Middle East didn’t have oil, or Israel, or the Suez Canal, we probably couldn’t care less what they do to themselves. It’s amazing what religion, resources, and infrastructure can do to nations causing them to invest blood and treasure.
4417 2018-10-20 21:38:39 @BootstrapCook got any ideas for wholemeal noodles, something quick and easy I have olives, feta cheese, sun-dried tomatoes in oil, frozen courgettes, might have garlic, lots of dried chilli herbs got eggs oh and some frozen soya beans and tinned chick peas
4418 2018-10-20 21:38:21 We disagree on some things I see but the truth is we are still leaders in environmental conservation/protection. There is always a balance between what can be done & what people are willing to give up. No one will ditch the use of oil for example. Where will it come from?
4419 2018-10-20 21:38:16 My take is that as of Q1 this year (after Cohn/Tillerson resigned, job done) US dollar has essentially been pegged vs (inflated) oil price by implicit convertibility for shale reserves. This accounts for FX moves from Q1. So my call is when (not if) oil collapses $ will follow it
4420 2018-10-20 21:37:56 "We" don't. Private enterprise does. They don't want our oil and that is reflected in the price. The market has spoken.

Answer one very simple question:
Why isn't the oil in the existing TransMountain pipeline going overseas to fetch this supposedly better price?
4421 2018-10-20 21:37:48 What will be done. Nothing. Saudi is the oil power. Saudi is majority muslim. Saudi is by definition the richest. What will anyone do nothing. Even the UN nothing. Saudi wont pay its UN fees and the UN does nothing. We all helped create this. What do we do?
4422 2018-10-20 21:37:44 You never see something
4423 2018-10-20 21:37:38 Lol I love how you tell me the oil don't taste good. I tried to not say it but you did 
4424 2018-10-20 21:37:26 In bed with evil misogynistic murderers who because of their oil wealth feel they are untouchable l.
4425 2018-10-20 21:37:24 Especially if they come from an autocratic country where they feel they can act with impunity on 'their soil'. Saudi Arabia execute more people after China and Iran. They control oil prices. Bin Laden was a Saud, 15 of the 9/11 attackers were Saud. Its time people woke up.
4426 2018-10-20 21:37:14 Good to know! I oil pull with coconut oil and I get a ton of coconut oil in my diet but don't put it directly on my skin. I'll try that out.

4434 2018-10-20 21:36:38 Nah, just kidding. You can do spanish omelette as you want, just that the original (and best one if you know how to make it) it's only potatoes, eggs and oil (some people add onion too) 
4435 2018-10-20 21:36:36 Oil Preds tonight!!!! Let’s make it 4 in a row boyz
4436 2018-10-20 21:36:24 You’re a perfect example of why Saudi Arabians, after almost 100yrs of vast wealth , are still not capable of running their own country or producing anything other than oil. The problem is in the name....Saud.
4437 2018-10-20 21:36:19 Given that oil and gas are the driving force behind a huge amount of what we've discovered about what we used to call Trump Russia that has proven to involve many more countries, ARAMCO probably is a major factor. The chaos theory seems plausible.
4438 2018-10-20 21:36:00 Allah sawake
4439 2018-10-20 21:35:53 3) The real goal is the few lines My opinion is prohibiting gas or oil drills in some areas it's a good idea But the true goal is prohibiting vaping
4) now difficulties arose  people know the trick sometime it's uneasy to distinguish true motives Paradox of I know that you know
4440 2018-10-20 21:35:42 Learning to drill oil and kill westerns
4441 2018-10-20 21:35:39 Trump made the US the nr.1 oil producer in the world. How would that help Russia? He also criticizes western European dependence on Russian gas.
4442 2018-10-20 21:35:20 Zika virus is not related to oil.

4444 2018-10-20 21:35:03 RT @LivingSafely: Cheeze-It this October? Its top three ingredients are flour, soybean and palm oil with tert-Butylhydroquinone.
4445 2018-10-20 21:34:57 Correct.  Oil is priced in dollars only i.e. a numeraire
4446 2018-10-20 21:34:56 we ain't found any so far,,   we r like damocles & the lamp oil is low
4447 2018-10-20 21:34:55 You can dehydrate and use later. Or put them in a food processor with a little olive oil put in a sandwich bag, freeze then break off what you need. Dehydrate then vacuum seal.
4448 2018-10-20 21:34:52 How long did it take twins to change the oil...20 minutes 
4449 2018-10-20 21:34:46 And money; they forgot to mention vast swathes of filthy, bloodstained oil money

4455 2018-10-20 21:34:20 So like old burnt-up motor oil, black, bitter, thick, and full of broken dreams?
4456 2018-10-20 21:34:09 *flames* I don’t need oil!
4457 2018-10-20 21:33:58 The Saudis are spending billions of dollars of oil money to American public Relation firm to say good thing about the Kingdom.

Washington is flooded with Saudi money for image make over. the Republican and Trump are cashing in big.

4459 2018-10-20 21:33:46 In a dutch oven with 2 tablespoons of oil....then fresh melted butter!
4460 2018-10-20 21:33:43 The problem is that everyone assumed oil would stay well over $100/barrel so people would buy smaller cars. As soon as fuel prices dropped, the market rushed even faster into trucks and utilities
4461 2018-10-20 21:33:12 Coconut oil in dry or wet hair and leave it like a leave in conditioner. Over night would be preferably and it adds moisture to the hair so when you colour it it doesn’t dry it completely!
4462 2018-10-20 21:33:10 SaudiArabia murdered Khashoggi. SA also financed 9/11. It won’t be held accountable for either because of OIL & $. Remember this at the pump

Friend: Can I get oil and vinegar?

Me: Woahhhhh. Hard R dood. It’s Vinega. Racist.
4464 2018-10-20 21:32:55 JABBA IS RUNNING!!! Now time to get a oil pan and hope to god it’s not a head gasket problem 
4465 2018-10-20 21:32:50 Not true oil solves a lot of issues including this one which is really no big deal
4466 2018-10-20 21:32:47 If I had time I would go off on this place like I did with my Bay Area rant. There's enough material. The meth industry here must rival oil in Texas.
4467 2018-10-20 21:32:32 Saudis are and have been one of the most corrupt and extremist Muslim countries. Have provided more more money towards territorial than any other ME Country. Oil rules here, unfortunately.
4468 2018-10-20 21:32:29 I love the gummy bears and the water based oil most. Ok the oils don’t taste good but the cherry limeade is tolerable
4469 2018-10-20 21:32:26 Hey coconut oil
4470 2018-10-20 21:32:22 Not necessarily. For a long time saudis were necessary for oil. After the shale revolution saudis could be ditched for good, and europe could go back to iran as oil source.
4471 2018-10-20 21:32:20 @ec_minister  and @justintrudeau puppets of foreign oil who do not walk the COP21 talk are not #realchange eh? #cdnpoli #bcpoli
4472 2018-10-20 21:32:19 Correction @KarlolynKorner. We WERE leaders in protecting our environment. Until Trump/GOP buddies decided it's fake news & have removed almost every protection previously enacted Trump is single handedly destroying it. This group wants cuts to coal, big oil & widespread fracking
4473 2018-10-20 21:32:08 we have some corn kernels in the cupboard >squeak< let 's bypass chores and pop them instead >squeak< lemme find some oil ...

4475 2018-10-20 21:31:40 CSA tip: if you get kohlrabi try roasting it (slice 1/2” thick, olive oil, s&p, 450°F ~30 minutes, flip every 10 minutes). Delicious!

4480 2018-10-20 21:30:49 Sitting in the oil field listening to the pumps turn on. Wonderful sound
4481 2018-10-20 21:30:38 When will the crooked oil industry stop buying Saudi oil when better options exist? Why don't East Coast refineries buy oil from Norway, Brazil or Mexico. Or here's a crazy idea..Nfld??
4482 2018-10-20 21:30:33 I’ll try but it’s 7 am in Australia down That beer GO OIL
4483 2018-10-20 21:30:29 It was probably a hit. Even if it was a kidnapping, then your govt are still no better than gangsters.

The Saudi regime is brutal, repressive and corrupt. 

What's worse is our own leaders have been happy to play along for the sake of selling jets and buying oil.

4486 2018-10-20 21:30:06 You can also just roast cauliflower on a flat sheet with a drizzle of oil, and the caramelization will give it a pretty nice flavor on its own.
You're welcome.
4487 2018-10-20 21:30:03 I’m so proud of myself. I got my grades up for the quarter, I have two job interviews this week, I’m talking to my dad more, and I got the oil in my car changed. Go me.
4488 2018-10-20 21:29:59 Bae been taking care of my car for months he should’ve told me my oil change was $60

4493 2018-10-20 21:29:17 Haven’t you seen Ted’s TV ads? He’s fighting for the oil and gas industry. But fighting for his constituents?  Nah, he’s fighting to take away their health care.

4498 2018-10-20 21:28:44 Funny that they endorsed the Irish guy. I would have thought the Hispanic guy that backs oil & gas would have gotten a Houston’s paper endorsement

4500 2018-10-20 21:28:36 Disturbing news but very true.I have been cleaning a beach in Mumbai for the past one year now and the amount dead marine species that wash up on its shore is unimaginable.

4502 2018-10-20 21:28:28 Dinner idea tonight: 
Saute leeks in olive oil and garlic until fragrant. Add grass-fed beef mince and white wine, Cook thoroughly. Serve with couscous and a bit of balsamic vinegar.
4503 2018-10-20 21:28:27 so still not used to them so when turning in my little streets im turning too much lol, needs serviced on monday though, oil, oil filter and i reckon brake fluid change cause the pedal is spongy and inconsistent recently.
4504 2018-10-20 21:28:13 have not cleaned my hexmags in 4 years.  I guess I should.  maybe a mag brush then light oil on the spring.
4505 2018-10-20 21:28:09 Chances are this was caused by fracking. Big Oil is fracking all over that area, Southern, NM and all over Oklahoma as well. Oklahoma's earthquakes have increased exponentially over the last 10-15 years because of it.
4506 2018-10-20 21:28:01 You are making 0 sense and apparently don't understand basic math. We shouldn't need to import $70 oil from ANYONE. We SHOULD be building pipeline capacity to ship our own oil to more refiners globally, creating competition, and correcting the record WCS discount. Its very simple
4507 2018-10-20 21:27:54 Sorry sunshine I’m with Punk Papi on this one. 60 wins this year coming from Leafs land, I ain’t worried about nothing. I look forward to you bailing on the oil in the coming months... weeks  #leafsforever
4508 2018-10-20 21:27:51 Tom Bordonaro, has totally skewed the truth about what, yes on measure G really does. He doesn't want less oil on our Central Coast, he wants more oil in SLO County, STOP LYING, and vote yes on G.

4510 2018-10-20 21:27:18 Has anyone tried oil pulling? With coconut oil? Did it work? #coconutoil #coconut #teeth #dentist
4511 2018-10-20 21:27:16 also, In a pinch and a high smoke point you can use vegetable oil. Nothing wrong with it.
4512 2018-10-20 21:27:12 Same way Bubu spoke highly of us when he openly, internationally and deliberately said “Nigerian youths don’t want to do anything, they’re all looking forward to oil money”.
4513 2018-10-20 21:26:33 Lol doesn't prove anything
4514 2018-10-20 21:26:00 Where do you get the idea that the US "oversees" and/or dictates what goes on with the Saudi royal family? AFAWK the relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia is not like that between the US and Israel. For one thing, the Saudis have a shitload of oil under *their* country.
4515 2018-10-20 21:25:52 I’m so confused
4516 2018-10-20 21:25:51 Nooo I shall pree but do the have weed oil not normal vape wah me a do wid dat lol

4520 2018-10-20 21:25:25 You will keep sanitation workers employed if you flush those
4521 2018-10-20 21:25:22 Saudi Arabia is a corrupted and autocratic regime floated on oil revenues.  Our inability to wean ourselves off petroleum and our defense industry’s greed in selling arms prevent America from seeing the real nature of Saudi Arabia. S.Arabia is not a nice place.
4522 2018-10-20 21:25:17 My coworkers are mad at me for doing stuff other than oil changes kek
4523 2018-10-20 21:24:58 I was with her until she said diet... your diet can definitely help clear your system. There’s all types of foods like oil that don’t leave our system immediately and if you keep consuming them your body will always have them.
4524 2018-10-20 21:24:51 He just rambles like a mad man. Actually closer to someone who has had a stroke. He is going to let Saudi pass, because there is oil there and money. 2020 can't get here quick enough.
4525 2018-10-20 21:24:49 With a forensic specialist on hand to conveniently chop him up afterwards.. They are a murderous dictatorship and have been getting away with it because of the oil money. Time to put human values above Saudi oil money..
4526 2018-10-20 21:24:41 All he really needs is a wagon for his snake oil.
4527 2018-10-20 21:24:30 America doesn't care about oil. They themselves have plenty of it. They already have zero point energy & anti gravity crafts. Fossil fuels are just a charade.
4528 2018-10-20 21:24:27 It's super easy.  Toss in oil, roast on a cookie sheet at 300 for an hour (or until they are dry and roasty) then finish at 450 for 10 mins.  Salt while hot.  Best snack ever, and you can throw in some cayenne if you want spicy seeds
4529 2018-10-20 21:24:26 Painting still not finished. It's raining. Day started off sunny, but I had only a short window of good light because I was also busy with family stuff. Tomorrow is church/family day... so unfortunately this project (Melania oil painting) may have to wait until Monday.
4530 2018-10-20 21:24:20 GOP is the party of Big Biz Oil. See their campaign contributions. They are the party of deregulating air & water pollution, ignoring  #changeclimate and being Anti environment. The main Issues should be #environment and new energy direction and a future for youth

You just keep talking in circles and contradicting yourself.

4550 2018-10-20 21:21:57 Not actually tried them yet. They are a cross between Filius Blue and Bhut Jolokia so I'm guessing so. Smelled devine and a fair bit of oil as well. Shall report back Sir!

4556 2018-10-20 21:21:02 Gas and Oil are 10% of Colorado’s economy, and account for about 350,000 jobs. It is 30% of the economy in some rural towns. If Polis gets elected he will end our Gas and Oil Industry! #VOTE #WALKERSTAPLETON
4557 2018-10-20 21:21:00 I’m quite engaged with news and current events, but I never heard of Khashoggi before last week.  The left so wants this to be an issue to hurt Trump and Republicans, but I don’t see it resonating much outside of the DC beltway and liberal establishment corridors.

4567 2018-10-20 21:19:35 I would love to have a great country. No one goes hungry, no one feels excluded, no one lacks education, or a job or clean air or trees and national parks. No one fears oil spills or fracking water. I am all for making this country great. Let’s agree on what great means.
4568 2018-10-20 21:19:30 Yea, require all residential homes be required to use solar panels - must have electric / gas heat removed from home.  Shutdown ALL natural gas, oil production.
4569 2018-10-20 21:19:29 Call me a sentimental fool but I've finally realised how much more important money (weapons, oil etc) is than morality, I'm struck by how out of kilter our society is with most young people, naively thinking positive ideals will prevail! Very sad...
4570 2018-10-20 21:19:27 Atiku will be too busy filling his pocket to help this country move forward, countries like Ethiopia which had civil war even into 2000 have achieved stable power supply why can’t Nigeria do the same when we are the biggest oil exporters in Africa!! I will tell you why

4573 2018-10-20 21:19:23 Right. “Get em Beto.” He voted for a $10 tax on each barrel of oil produced in Texas (realizing this was immensely unpopular, he denied he did so, but AP fact checker confirmed he was lying). His “policy” on illegal immigration is to make all the illegal aliens “legal.”

4581 2018-10-20 21:18:43 Why do you think USA is in Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.... It is to control THEIR oil production, pure and simple....
4582 2018-10-20 21:18:20 maybe coconut oil can save my gpa
4583 2018-10-20 21:18:16 Saudi Arabia is a gender apartheid country and all apartheid countries should be boycotted. The world, in it's greed for oil, has looked the other way for far too long.
4584 2018-10-20 21:18:11 I doubt that oil will ever be pumped commercially. Savvy oil dealers will trade the rights amongst themselves merely for speculation because they know it can never be profitable.
4585 2018-10-20 21:17:52 Ha! The only things that matter in this world are $, drugs & oil.
4586 2018-10-20 21:17:52 Mary Ann, you were right to bring up that which Obambi ignored.  But then, we needed their oil because O was beholden to environwacks.  Thank goodness they do not have us under their thumbs.
4587 2018-10-20 21:17:13 The vote was clearly for a pristine, shiny bottle of snake oil. What's now on t' table is either a big cakebox of dog shit or a slightly smaller cakebox of dog shit. You may thus Bait and Switch, but don't dare to claim to be an advocate of democracy or "the Will of the People".
4588 2018-10-20 21:17:13 It seemed to be teeming with lobbyists, obscuring genuine debate. I was particularly struck by the academic who managed to argue that climate science was anti-enlightenment, before going on to eulogise about the benefits of the oil industry.

4595 2018-10-20 21:16:16 Like always, u hit the nail on the head, except for that one org you said "lobbies for stronger environmental laws". That org has a single issue mission, doesn't advocate for the springs, clean air, wildlife or clean renewable energy vs exploitation of public lands for oil/gas.
4596 2018-10-20 21:16:09 A whooping 9% of US oil imports come from Saudi Arabia. Get real man.
4597 2018-10-20 21:16:03 What a load of bollocks Konsiczky

They'd beat our door down to welcome us in
4598 2018-10-20 21:16:03 We have enough oil. Get out of this regime and put them on Trumps do not enter immigration list. Their the ones that are crimes.
4599 2018-10-20 21:15:54 I'm referencing to the tweet above as to why the Saudi's can call the shots for their oil production vs Russian (or other) crude. Issue is not about who has the Largest reserves but who has better Quality of oil & better Price for it. 

Saudi Fall back strategy is another matter.
4600 2018-10-20 21:15:50 and who the Fuck believes it!
The Democrats brand will Never 
be the Same. 
4601 2018-10-20 21:15:45 I say oil equities have a better chance at turning it around than gold miners. Miners are purely a bet on a higher gold price. Many oil equities are cash flow positive and paying big dividends. The business model is much better. I will wait it out and dollar cost avg the lows.

4605 2018-10-20 21:15:24 CBD oil helps with my A.D.D. vs using a really volatile scrip. Glad it helps you
4606 2018-10-20 21:15:20 The Earth Oil smuggles Islamic war machines.
4607 2018-10-20 21:15:14 Other US refiners are equipped to handle WCS, as are other refiners around the world, which we do not have access to. It would definetely be economic to ship oil to these places, particularly right now when the US refiners we use are shut down. Those economics have been proven.
4608 2018-10-20 21:15:09 I remember when we had a President and not this carnival huckster snake oil salesman
4609 2018-10-20 21:14:54 Moahz Oil and Gas is an independent indigenous oil and gas trading company specializing in the sales, distribution and storage of petroleum and cooking as well as related products. It is ideally located in Lagos, Nigeria.
4610 2018-10-20 21:14:49 Oil magnates in Nigeria are attending recipe swaps, gatherings that combine transdental meditation with panels on hot dog water, run by a celebrity chef.
4611 2018-10-20 21:14:38 Maybe if Paolatto could have found a single representative of a pension to stand with him at his announcement I wouldn’t call it what it is, snake oil.
4612 2018-10-20 21:14:14 If it wasn't for oil who knows what these people would do with themselves.
4613 2018-10-20 21:14:02 China is deleveraging. As it gains momentum - huge implications for the dollar, oil, EM, gold, and by default most of EU.
4614 2018-10-20 21:13:40 The problem is this: if we unhook the dollar — our national Utility Token, required for the Saudi “oil app” — from Saudi Arabia, the dollar will instantly plunge, since nothing else backs it. Seems like crypto is the obvious solution.
4615 2018-10-20 21:13:34 Also I don't think it's legal to sale enzyme modified coconut oil just FYI since that does cause odd LPC ; I think that's illegal in EU & US
4616 2018-10-20 21:13:20 Toh rigimarmiya 
4617 2018-10-20 21:13:02 i feel sorry for the woman that i end up marrying, i don’t think i can go a single day without getting oil and grease all over me
4618 2018-10-20 21:12:59 ヌルッとお見通しだ！
4619 2018-10-20 21:12:59 Well we can certainly agree on the fact that there will not be the revenues to fund widespread social change after Brexit.Structural changes under the Thatcher Government were funded by North Sea oil.However, socialists of Corbyn's ilk are not that bothered by money or lack of it
4620 2018-10-20 21:12:55 Ill romance people if I find em but this dude was the first, not going near that goat oil guy no thanks
4621 2018-10-20 21:12:30 Waiting on this freaking oil change 
4622 2018-10-20 21:12:30 But if we cut ties with Saudi Arabia we'll have to buy more Canadian tar sands oil and that would make Bill McKibben have a sad.

4624 2018-10-20 21:12:22 Are you saying we haven't sent in troups to protect our Oil interests?
4625 2018-10-20 21:12:21 They never will whilst ever they have oil and wealth.
4626 2018-10-20 21:12:20 Saudis have had a long term policy of keeping oil prices reasonable, so renewable energy sources don't replace their bread and butter. We need to call their bluff
4627 2018-10-20 21:12:16 Rob McKenna represents Chevron Oil -- but his ads against a carbon fee don't disclose that ‘minor’ detail. Take these dishonest ads down @Kiro7Seattle @komonews @Q13Fox @KING5Seattle #waelex
4628 2018-10-20 21:12:15 If you are not equipped to refine the oil it's of no use no matter what the price.

And you think it would be economical to pay to ship this bargain basement oil 5000kms ?

EE was barely economical with $100 oil.
4629 2018-10-20 21:11:46 Oil.
4630 2018-10-20 21:11:42 Hi hope you are well. I successfully run a business named Golden Oil Stretch Marks Massage Therapy. This treatment defies science. I would love an opportunity to prove science wrong. When can I provide my service? I would love to do a collaboration with you. Thank you
4631 2018-10-20 21:11:37 He makes snake oil salesmen ashamed of their business.
4632 2018-10-20 21:11:34 ...i've got some genuine snake oil, it's $200 a bottle but we are having a special this week...you can have 2 bottles for $500...cash will be fine.
4633 2018-10-20 21:11:26 Diciembre será un mes clave para la producción de shale oil en Vaca Muerta ya que un nuevo módulo de tratamiento de crudo (PTC) en la planta de Loma Campana se habilitará parcialmente y abrirá la puerta a un aumento del 37% en los despachos de petróleo (unos 14.800 m3dia). $YPF.
4634 2018-10-20 21:11:26 STOP economic exploitation. 
STOP exploitation to Islamic contrys oil.
STOP exploitation to raw materials.
You are destroy the world.
4635 2018-10-20 21:11:25 Red wine & cannabis oil 
4636 2018-10-20 21:11:17 Oh Trump... to pretend to condemn Saudi Arabia and then call them a ‘great ally’.. just tell it like it is and say they’re a great source of oil and money. They sure ain’t your friends... #TRUMPISALIAR
4637 2018-10-20 21:11:16 Emma the firefighter plays a violin with a bottle of oil on it before painting a corundum or azalea using nouveau realisme
4638 2018-10-20 21:11:08 Disqualified today and yesterday for dropping oil  The car has dropped oil the last 3 runs in a row, albeit in different ways. So I think we’re going home early.
4639 2018-10-20 21:11:03 You just know though that @realDonaldTrump is going to play it all down, claim to have seen the evidence required and wait til it all dies down a bit. Got to keep those oil deals and weapons deals flowing eh.
4640 2018-10-20 21:10:52 The WORLD, not just the US needs all the oil that can be pumped by every country. Look up the word fungible
4641 2018-10-20 21:10:44 he worked for an oil company in Texas
4642 2018-10-20 21:10:41 Fancy paying to hear a pack of lies from a snake oil salesman. Before you moan about that statement tell me one thing that he promised about Brexit that is true.
4643 2018-10-20 21:10:06 Why does every bitch who runs these "LGBT Trans Rainbow Social Equality uWu" Instagram accounts look like a pug dog that rolled in oil paint?
4644 2018-10-20 21:10:06 RT @LivingSafely: Cheeze-It this October? Its top three ingredients are flour, soybean and palm oil with tert-Butylhydroquinone.

4646 2018-10-20 21:10:00 I work in oil & has. Guess I’m a Nazi in her mind, Kurt.  So damn stupid.
4647 2018-10-20 21:09:54 My favorite pipe tobacco review ever: 

"...an English blend heavy on the latakia and perique. The kind a bearded captain would smoke while navigating an oil tanker through the Strait of Hormuz"
4648 2018-10-20 21:09:47 If one more person tells me that it isn't difficult to find a job I'm going to boil them in fucking oil I swear to fuck. THIRTEEN months I've been applying for jobs and have I had a single offer? But no, it's really easy to find a job in the UK. Fuck off.
4649 2018-10-20 21:09:44 Same I have warm washcloth on my eye right now lol this dry weather makes ur oil glands in ur eye clog up. Tea tree oil+warm compress !
4650 2018-10-20 21:09:28 Because the #globalist press is in cahoots with the clerical Iranian regime along with the so-called progressives. It is all about money. In this access to the Iranian market and under the table bribe aka discount for oil.
4651 2018-10-20 21:09:26 America is dependent on SA's arm purchases and oil.  Economy couldn't take that hit on top of everything else, which SA knows.

Everyone knows it but America, at this point.
4652 2018-10-20 21:09:20 It was shortly after Saudi commitment to replace Iran oil exports, very damaging to Saudi relations specially with western countries and multinational companies that lost interest in investing in Saudi Arabia ever since, something very beneficial to Qatar and Iran regimes
4653 2018-10-20 21:08:53 Them: We call that over there, "cheese crack", you should try it. It's cheese, olive oil, and other stuff...
Me: Goes over to try "cheese crack".
Me: Tries some "cheese crack".
Me: "Tries" a lot more cheese crack.
Me: Buys as much cheese crack as fits in my bag.
4654 2018-10-20 21:08:51 Dreamland! Oil continue to destroy last years idiosyncrasies and light up the Preds backup goalie like it's New Years Eve.
4655 2018-10-20 21:08:30 Do you actually get any real news? He told the EU to stop buying oil and natural gas from Russia. Russia is our enemy in Syria and most of the middle east.
4656 2018-10-20 21:08:27 Saudi have killed him brutally 

Just like they have killed journalists before 

And he won’t be the last they will kill 

And nobody will say anything 

Because of the Saudi oil & money
4657 2018-10-20 21:08:26 Venezuela is 100% dependent on oil revenues. Seems that’s more the GOPs goal.
4658 2018-10-20 21:08:21 9/11 was Saudi citizens, Bin Laden was Saudi, Yemen is being destroyed and millions killed by Saudi Arabia, Saudis fund terrorist worldwide, and you rape the world by rigging the price of oil. What do you expect?
4659 2018-10-20 21:08:06 *one week into ap bio*

*holds up bottle of olive oil*

“Ah yes I love non polar covalent bonds”
4660 2018-10-20 21:08:06 Won’t matter how he died honestly. America isn’t gonna cancel any trade dealing or risk a spike in oil over 1 death. The Saudi’s have been throwing gays off roofs for years and no one bats an eye
4661 2018-10-20 21:07:59 i just cleaned my car, put air in my tires, and changed my oil. coulda went to school to be a doctor but dropped out and chose to be a cAr MeChAnIc 
4662 2018-10-20 21:07:54 Why would anyone want Saudi imports? Anyone who would prefer to import oil at $70 a barrel and export oil at $25 a barrel is obviously not very intelligent. If we had proper pipeline capacity we would not need to import oil and the provincial & federal economies would be stronger
4663 2018-10-20 21:07:50 Yeah you can apparently vape the weed, the oil, and the concentrated kind. I think the first time are legal here only...for now
4664 2018-10-20 21:07:47 Full tank 
Oil change 
Tire rotation & air 
4665 2018-10-20 21:07:44 Herbs no because I want to maintain the oil essence and not bleach it out. Just wash and freeze break off when I want some
4666 2018-10-20 21:07:41 It's possible to do it without meat just more challenging. The biggest thing is to get you fat in... (As opposed to Atkins which is more about protein). If you can have olive oil, and butter and full fat dairy you can certainly do it.
4667 2018-10-20 21:07:28 I can't reach the olive oil in walmart...remodeled...maybe kareem abdul jabbar could reach it I'm not sure...
4668 2018-10-20 21:07:24 These are literally just normal wipes.
4669 2018-10-20 21:06:56 I advise all to avoid -- goose, lard, egg yolk, tuna in oil, peanut butter, margarine, palm oil, butter, chocolate -- in large amounts, & instead to seek out fat free or low fat
4670 2018-10-20 21:06:50 hey everyone. today i dropped a thermometer straight into the hot fryer oil. it was a digital one with plastic casing. it did not survive
4671 2018-10-20 21:06:37 All over world poor never get opportunities from natural resources. Just read about Venezuela, a country rich with oil but people very very poor.  Poor can only get opportunities with higher education, nothing else.
4672 2018-10-20 21:06:34 Oil and we sell them military arms. Always the oil
4673 2018-10-20 21:06:32 Sharpie oil paint markers. Clean off  extra paint right away or use super fine steel wool.
4674 2018-10-20 21:06:28 This oil and gas employee does not fear job loss if Beto wins and a $10 barrel tax imposed, as Cruz claimed in most recent debate.
4675 2018-10-20 21:06:21 Garlic oil is great for earaches.
4676 2018-10-20 21:06:11 Is is oil rice you don’t need stew
4677 2018-10-20 21:06:07 The Saudi Arabia don't need your weapons
But Germany is indeed of Saudi Arabia money and oil
4678 2018-10-20 21:05:54 Don't worry King Trump. There Really R Some People that think U R a Nice guy. Tell us where U would like us 2 ask. Oil Drilling workers, coal workers w lung disease, National Parks where people wear masks now or fishermen who don't mind selling mercury laced fish. Please advise
4679 2018-10-20 21:05:54 WT absolute F is there no depth he is not  willing to sink to? He is nothing more than a snake oil salesmen. Marketing is all about twisting facts, spinning a yarn, and trying to hook people in. @TheIPA LNP are holding our country to ransom and we need to wrestle it back
4680 2018-10-20 21:05:45 The most shocking thing about Flynn's traitorous actions is the selling of nuclear reactors. That means they need their oil for revenue so much they'd want to use Nuke domestically. This has major future implications, like petro- desalination of water
4681 2018-10-20 21:05:42 Our foreign policy becomes so transactional all of the sudden. Name the price: US security bonds, oil, arms deals..... Throw the higher moral standards out the window. No need for them!
4682 2018-10-20 21:05:40 Hi hope you are well. I successfully run a business named Golden Oil Stretch Marks Massage Therapy. This treatment defies science. I would love an opportunity to prove science wrong. When can I provide my service? I would love to do a collaboration with you. Thank you
4683 2018-10-20 21:05:40 I was prolly my fault too. I was like give me the best oil y’all got! I want that synthetic, synthetic!
4684 2018-10-20 21:05:31 Why does @realDonaldTrump want to turn everywhere into Venezuela? Is it the oil?
4685 2018-10-20 21:05:31 I am still very curious of the motives of those involved in killing of #Khashoggi. Due to the timing of the incident in a very sensitive time (the coming Iran oil sanctions, the important business events,...) I wonder if it was intentional, possibly acted on behalf of Qatar
4686 2018-10-20 21:05:21 About 60.2 million barrels of stolen Nigerian crude oil got into the United States thru Philadelphia between 2011 & 2014.

4687 2018-10-20 21:05:13 Get your money back.
4688 2018-10-20 21:04:53 Our shipments from Saudi oil dropped 14% this year... but you know Narrative.
4689 2018-10-20 21:04:20 It’s not trump that has something!  It’s the Russians, i.e Putin. Lindsay is compromised over money he received when he ran for President and oil investments.
4690 2018-10-20 21:04:03 the oil and mask are stupid expensive but they make a kit with the smaller sizes of the oil, mask, and their toner (for $60, steep but cheaper than buying them individually) but i like the pixi toner better and that’s $15 at target
4691 2018-10-20 21:04:00 Back then I would comb coconut oil through it before bed then wash it out in the morning. No sodding time these days  Body Shop Strawberry Glossing shampoo is good tho
4692 2018-10-20 21:03:51 You drive a car, take a bus or fly in a plane, George? You use plenty of fossil fuels, so don't tweet about "blood oil money" lest you seem like a twit. 

Trump kisses no ones ass and is doing fine.
4693 2018-10-20 21:03:46 Then where would we get our oil from?
4694 2018-10-20 21:03:37 ふふ……首輪……
4695 2018-10-20 21:03:34 Dinner idea tonight: 
Diced beef sausage stewed with quality sea-salt. Toast ciabatta with olive oil and chopped leeks. Serve immediately.
4696 2018-10-20 21:03:14 Oil
4697 2018-10-20 21:03:09 “small” events trigger  the decline of ruling dynasties. Bashar / Hariri , Ben Ali / Bouazizi....with the end of the oil era in the next 5 to 10 years, the Al Saoud became “disposable”
4698 2018-10-20 21:02:59 Pour some of that crisco oil on it
4699 2018-10-20 21:02:55 It was trialed by Red Bull but was ruled out. Try driving a road car with no windscreen wipers with rubber and oil !
4700 2018-10-20 21:02:51 The extra electricity was used to decarbonise heating, transport was next but the price of oil collapsed.
4701 2018-10-20 21:02:50 just got to the dealership. have a 2.5 hour wait for an oil change. ugh
4702 2018-10-20 21:02:45 Let's go Italian. Isang kapirasong talong, thinly sliced and lightly coated with olive oil...then tuhog ng bbq stick sabay ihaw. At kulafu. Sa bahay. Habang nanonood ng news sa tv.
4703 2018-10-20 21:02:23 The Nigerian govt. is already having a fiscal crisis and the govt. revenue is extremely low. Tax to GPD ratio one of the lowest in the world (6%). Non oil tax to Non oil GDP is just about 1%.
4704 2018-10-20 21:01:49 > DIAL HYDNOCARPUS OIL
DON'T KNOW HOW TO DIAL HYDNOCARPUS OIL
4705 2018-10-20 21:01:47 Good idea. Too bad we are so financially enmeshed with the Saudi Arabia. It is impossible to punish them severely when we depend on oil so heavily. If only our government had moved to renewable energy and beyond peak oil industrialisation instead of navel gazing for so long.
4706 2018-10-20 21:01:37 Just spent 1500$ on new tires, new brakes, new rotors, and an oil change. Being an adult hurts. 
4707 2018-10-20 21:01:37 Mac n cheese or lasagna  the way my aunt makes it tsss oil, she gone guide me lol

4712 2018-10-20 21:01:08 Biggest oil reserves in the world. Collapsing since socialists came to power. Oil price excuse cum hoc non propter hoc.

4724 2018-10-20 20:59:48 We've had a hard month and it's interesting that most games are due to Iran's oil.full boycott of Iran's oil isthe key to regime change in Iran,and China's and India's refineries know that there will be no exemptions.There is a golden opportunity to cut off the roots of terrorism
4725 2018-10-20 20:59:46 Thats obvious isn't it! Look at the Russian involvement in Syria, middle East! They would sure love to have control of all that oil!#RESIST
4726 2018-10-20 20:59:40 You only buy one million barrels per day. We sell the rest to China and Asia plus we are strong ally to USA not because of oil. You need to read history my friend.
4727 2018-10-20 20:59:39 What do you think happens from here? Looks like it trades for less than PDP on conservative oil price assumptions. Can it really get worse?
4728 2018-10-20 20:59:36 Or, when the going gets tough change the oil in the wife’s car.
4729 2018-10-20 20:59:33 They also rely heavily on vast oil wealth, which they ship to all major countries in the world, with Norway being the 5th largest exporter in the world.  If their oil and gas sector was attacked like the Canadian one has been their countries would collapse.
4730 2018-10-20 20:59:06 Seriously. Try it
4731 2018-10-20 20:59:02 Okay so boom gel manicures are not the wave for someone who works in this much water, oil, and butter mediums all my pretty nails I grew have broken. That’s it I’m getting an acrylic overlay!

4735 2018-10-20 20:58:39 Why are you interrogating me? The people to ask are the oil snake people that have promised us sunlit uplands. They are the ones that said a deal would be ...’easy’

and not an accidental death
committed in a Consulate

but because we rely upon this terrible regime for money and oil
we do nothing
we need to take a long look at ourselves in the mirror
to see what we have become
4740 2018-10-20 20:57:54 90 for the ABS and 180 for the oil.
4741 2018-10-20 20:57:48 Wait until we stop buying your oil. Money talks.
4742 2018-10-20 20:57:39 And the world will let it slide because, well, oil. If only there were some alternative renewable kind of resources to replace oil. That way the Saudi’s power base would collapse and the oil guzzling nations could hold the to account. Thoughts? @simonahac @PetraAu
4743 2018-10-20 20:57:22 Pls where are the completed projects? And for those justifying borrowing by its rank of local, state and fed govt, we should know that without the FG's nod, no state borrows. Our govt is a govt of "loan" despite oil price improvement!

4745 2018-10-20 20:57:18 #JamalKhashoggi We will forget and forgive, and silence will prevail -- all in the name of Oil
4746 2018-10-20 20:57:10 I’ve written my representatives and made calls to their offices about it. I’m pissed. I’m a republican but murder doesn’t know a political side. I also don’t believe in supporting any countries that aren’t democracies. Of course we will need to pump oil from elsewhere.
4747 2018-10-20 20:56:57 It’s at least surprising that stories about US/Saudi relations fail to mention the inextricably interwoven connection btwn Saudis keeping the global oil mkt in $ alongside investment of petro-$ in the US. Nothing will happen b/c it can’t be allowed to happen.
4748 2018-10-20 20:56:36 I have done it.obviously in an ideal world I go oil and oil but it isn't always ideal
4749 2018-10-20 20:56:34 No vex... Na even the oil pipeline one he tweet. 8 days after, FAM. Na November we go see the KD own
4750 2018-10-20 20:56:29 Olive oil tasting places are so damn pretentious, olive oil isn’t even that good by itself. People will drink shot glasses of gross nutty olive oil like it’s a wine tasting. Why are there so many different kinds of olive oil.
4751 2018-10-20 20:56:24 Wisdom will not kee you
4752 2018-10-20 20:56:09 Why?
4753 2018-10-20 20:56:06 I sort of remember something like that.  I have also@had oil in my ear. 
4754 2018-10-20 20:55:59 chop an onion, a stick of celery, garlic. whack it in a hot pan with sunflower oil and cumin (or curry powder). fry on medium heat, turn down, and add a can of baked beans, tomato puree, fresh coriander and maybe spinach. yum!

(add chilli if you like)
4755 2018-10-20 20:55:58 Arms for oil has been the foundation of our relationship with the Saudis for 100 years.
4756 2018-10-20 20:55:51 They will start with threatening the EU with oil prices. Arrogance of the Saudis are so immense high that they don’t even care what people think about their lies.
4757 2018-10-20 20:55:47 I should have stayed with it, I could be a big oil man. Do my Daniel Plainview voice a lot. Alas, as I said, 9/11 and so forth
4758 2018-10-20 20:55:47 I got my daith pierced to help with vertigo and migraines - definitely noticed an improvement. Peppermint oil is also somewhat helpful, have you seen a chiropractor about it? They may be able to help, teach you some pressure point relief maybe.
4759 2018-10-20 20:55:43 im back from the faire i got a real fox tail but its dyed magenta amd i got some oil perfume that smells like gummy worms and this rlly fancy beeswax stuff that i use as makeup remover but they only sell it at the ren fair it smells liek pineapples
4760 2018-10-20 20:55:42 No one seems to notice that President Trump's oil policy of domestic production will soon make the ME irrelevant. The big picture.
4761 2018-10-20 20:55:37 You can beg to differ all you like but plenty of nations manage fine without oil, it is not the be all and end all. Frankly I dont give two hoots about the UK, Scotland can do fine on its own, about time the rest on the UK had ambition to stand on their own two feet as well.
4762 2018-10-20 20:55:25 @MrLittleBear Your company was listed in a local news article about CBD oil, can you still sell?

4765 2018-10-20 20:55:06 Mushrooms need butter or oil to be truly tasty. Or so my Greek Friends tell me.
4766 2018-10-20 20:55:01 Lol you've played yourself
4767 2018-10-20 20:55:01 I remember when someone else pumped gas for you.  Cleaned the windows and checked the oil too.
4768 2018-10-20 20:54:57 It's time to end America's oil addiction & cut off all military aid to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Al-Saud dynasty has more than enough money to protect & preserve its hegemony in the Near East. Let them defend their own borders with their own money. #EndCorruptionNow
4769 2018-10-20 20:54:31 I dont care. I might take a look when the news headline is you and your snake oil selling, carpet bagging family are going to jail.
4770 2018-10-20 20:54:29 Bruh that oil better take some mileage off
4771 2018-10-20 20:54:21 Always surprised by the amount of hate and venom in climate deniers posts. Surely they realize the mess we are in? Trolls, paid for by gas and oil companies?  Delusional?
4772 2018-10-20 20:54:18 可愛いと思いますよ。
4773 2018-10-20 20:54:15 We should also stop buying oil from them....and use our own clean, socially and environmentally responsible oil from western Canada instead!!  #energyeast
4774 2018-10-20 20:54:09 *orders extra olive oil... 

Gotchu 
4775 2018-10-20 20:54:02 They’re my favorite (the sprouts, not the feet) but I know a lot of people who feel the way you do. (BTW, drizzle the steamed sprouts with olive oil, melt butter in a Dutch oven, add the sprouts and cook till lightly (or darkly) browned. Yum.)
4776 2018-10-20 20:54:01 I thought that remoaners would have accepted the reality that 52 is greater than 48, tantrums run out of steam eventually. Now they've had their little stroll they're reinvigorated. It's like petrol was thrown on a flame, quite apt in Alistair Campbell's case, he does like oil.
4777 2018-10-20 20:53:59 very wrong. not overproduction. the issue is that there is no way to get the product to refiners. there are only a few refineries equipped to handle WCS that we have access to. If we had the required pipelines, we get get oil to new refineries globally and create competition.
4778 2018-10-20 20:53:57 Are you allergic to hot oil treatments, or....?
4779 2018-10-20 20:53:45 Its world politics and where it happened and who is accused of doing it is/are NOT our country.  Plus unfortunately our country needs their oil more then justice for one person.
4780 2018-10-20 20:53:38 I don't know what kind of oil they use...but dang their french fries are delectable..... @JC_RWRC loves him some fries...matter of fact anything cooked in oil...he loves...
4781 2018-10-20 20:53:33 They are but it ain’t nothing a lil castor oil can’t fix 
4782 2018-10-20 20:53:31 Inminent Family Coup in Ryadh? Looks that MBS is Toxic now for the House of Saud. And he has no few enemies @ home. That's my bet. Beware of Oil $150-200 if this happens.
4783 2018-10-20 20:53:20 I have developed some deep feelings for rosemary & olive oil chips
4784 2018-10-20 20:53:15 it made me immediately want to consume all the examples provided (good olive oil, salumi, pesto, a solid ragu w/ pasta), which is a rousing success for a cooking show

4786 2018-10-20 20:53:06 I'm sorry about your brother and those Saudis have never been punished for what they did! Why do we do anything with Saudi Arabia! Let them choke on their oil! Human rights mean nothing! It's all about money! Please remove the blind Justice lady! She's dead!

4789 2018-10-20 20:52:44 I meant how the British royals aren’t supposed to be political but how they readily accept Saudi Royal gifts.  The whole oil using world is at the mercy of the oil rich countries.

4794 2018-10-20 20:52:17 Just watched film shooter and Il bet it's very close to the real truth of what goes on in the American and other world political scene? Politicians and journalists assassinated by politicians or who works for them all for oil or money
4795 2018-10-20 20:52:16 So I went to go get my oil changed today.. and I was wearing some AKA nalia.. why the creeps working on my car say, “gone and make that sound y’all do, baby” 
I’m like is my car ready, sir? Yes say yes and then attempts to skee wee..
I tried to shut his hand in the cardoor
4796 2018-10-20 20:52:10 I mean... we can prove a lot worse shit from basically every government. people just accept it. like we know what Saudi are doing in Yemen. we know they buy oil from ISIS and sell it to the West. we know they kill journalists all the time. we know they kill innocent civilians

Your actions are those of a butterfly, no discernable strategy, just fluttering around hoping to find a brassica. Oops!! Bird took you out. No transition plan so consequences happen.
4799 2018-10-20 20:52:00 I believe it's called oil.
4800 2018-10-20 20:51:57 Thank you @BernieSanders, I'm an Albertan and oil has runs our economy to long! I really don't know why or government hasn't investested in alternative energy
4801 2018-10-20 20:51:44 I am a life long Texan! I'm voting for Beto. Sick of the corruption of the Reds in Texas. Gas, oil and the NRA control Texas. Money is more important than anything to them and power of course.
4802 2018-10-20 20:51:40 Quite the pickle. Depressingly, I suspect oil money will ultimately win.
4803 2018-10-20 20:51:37 Storming the border isn't the legal route, by the way
4804 2018-10-20 20:51:29 Hmm might be the oil. I'm using the one @ElegantlySunnah sell
4805 2018-10-20 20:51:26 Karli’s car and my truck use the same oil, and while that is super convenient for me, I imagine it looks weird when I buy 13 quarts of oil at the same time lol
4806 2018-10-20 20:51:24 My grandfather still smells like oil and earth, and he hasn’t been capable of tinkering in years. It’s reassuring that he still smells that way. It’s like the work that he loved never left him.
4807 2018-10-20 20:51:17 It’s from all the oil perfumes u sell 
4808 2018-10-20 20:51:16 Did u change ur oil tho

4816 2018-10-20 20:50:26 Not gonna happen - who will buy the weapons? Who is going to take on Iran? Who is going to counter balance Iran in Lebanon? US is going to be biggest producer of oil next year, but still needs a buffer oil supply in war - so unrealistic - not gonna happen in all likelihood.

4818 2018-10-20 20:50:19 Do u know the logistical and economic nightmare it means to have to transport a raw material like crude oil a thousand miles to refine....now tell me why a Dangote will prefer to site his refinery close to the source in Lagos rather than Kano...simply bcos he's not stupid!
4819 2018-10-20 20:50:11 Thanks, it's also a pain in the arse cleaning the blender afterwards isn't it?  I bought a soup maker but nobody told me to oil it first &the veg stuck to the bottom & switched itself off!

4833 2018-10-20 20:48:57 No lotion! BABY OIL!!!
4834 2018-10-20 20:48:51 The problem the US has with going after Saudi Arabia is our economy is tied to Saudi Arabia. We don't need their oil like we use to but the Saudi's only accept US currency for oil. If the Saudi start taking euros for oil the value of the US dollar will drop & tank the US economy
4835 2018-10-20 20:48:49 ThTsa very silly statement. ‘There has to be something better right?’ How about ‘why don’t we have warp power? We’ve been thinking about it for a century? Why do we have fusion power, we’ve tried for 50 years... sorry right now oil and coal are are cheapest and most reliable
4836 2018-10-20 20:48:49 Not oil, but money!!

4840 2018-10-20 20:48:04 You are right.  We are not dependent on their oil.  However, the Saudis could certainly disrupt the price of oil globally leading to negative effects on both the US and it's allies.
  As I said, we need to hold the Saudis accountable for their actions.  All of their actions.

The anti inflammatory piperine in black pepper will help you absorb more nutrition from the ingredients.

4855 2018-10-20 20:46:10 Stories from the video that I noticed right away(haven't had a chance to view again looking for more) was the Adulterous Woman, Jesus clears temple of merchants working on Sabbath, and Woman anoints Jesus w/expensive oil wipes feet w/hair. Disciples & Judas Iscariot complain.
4856 2018-10-20 20:46:08 So we should shut down our primary source of oil over the murder of a Saudi citizen? What happened over Benghazi,  our own citizens Hillary & Obama left to die on foreign soil?? All to protect their illegal arms selling!!

4862 2018-10-20 20:45:42 Job number accuracy aside, arms trade with Saudi Arabia serves our greater strategic interests better than allowing Russia to achieve some sort of foot hold in the area should we withdraw.  And yes, there is oil to consider too.

4865 2018-10-20 20:45:37 - wash your face daily and nightly 

it is SO important to wash your face especially if you were a lot of makeup as an everyday routine. you should have a good face cleanser and an oil free acne moisturizer. cleaning your face daily + nightly uncloggs your pores of pollution

4878 2018-10-20 20:44:05 Actually we are only one energy disruption away. And Lockheed Martin has it. Oil will be irrelevant in < 5 yrs.
4879 2018-10-20 20:43:50 Some girls really need to change their oil 
4880 2018-10-20 20:43:44 I find your comment humerous at best, the citizenry as you call us would love to stop Saudi oil imports.  Getting behind @MaximeBernier and the #PPC2019 will drive that wish.
4881 2018-10-20 20:43:39 How common are oil thefts? Are they generally from lone houses or does it happen on housing estates as well?
4882 2018-10-20 20:43:37 Watching SaltFatAcidHeat and the olive oil nuance is warming my Cypriot heart.
4883 2018-10-20 20:43:33 Why do they say that ? All in one. I just can’t risk it all peeling or chipping off so like you, i do an u/c, usually w/b, under oil for speed.
4884 2018-10-20 20:43:21 This CBD oil seems to work much better when you smoke a joint.
4885 2018-10-20 20:43:10 Google the rice subsidy scam. @PremiumTimesng did an investigation into it. Also Madam NOI imposed an austerity measures in 2014 ending because of the falling price of oil. They lacked the political will to save, & ND avengers wahala. That's why we are in recession.
4886 2018-10-20 20:43:06 There are no permanent friends, only permanent interests! If the West were to stop selling weapons to SA, they will shut their oil taps. 
The Russians will step in to both sell arms to the Saudis & plug the gap, then the West will suddenly develop a conscience and vilify Russia.
4887 2018-10-20 20:43:03 If @realDonaldTrump has any balls, and can back up his big hard man persona he would slap an oil embargo on Saudi tomorrow. Buts he's just a little pussy
4888 2018-10-20 20:42:53 @iamemilymayo " Forrest GUMP , screened on Saturday Night"! What, A TRIBUTE ,to astute " Snake Oil ( man), recent OBSERVATIONS?
4889 2018-10-20 20:42:53 So this is how #Nigeria is treating the people who gave this World first #oil...disgusting, don't you think @antonioguterres @Shell @UN_PGA @UNEnvironment @EmmanuelMacron @theresa_may @BorisJohnson @MBuhari be ashamed of your actions, ask for #forgiveness @POTUS @IvankaTrump see?
4890 2018-10-20 20:42:40 so many myths around coconut oil! Personally I only like to use it in the kitchen
4891 2018-10-20 20:42:34 Coconut oil.
4892 2018-10-20 20:42:32 My mom has it really bad and uses essential oils. I believe it is peppermint in a carrier oil. She can’t take a lot of medication and she just rolls it on the back of her neck and it’s gone (or at least better) within about 30 minutes.
4893 2018-10-20 20:42:31 Thank YouPerhaps his Death will Spark a

4907 2018-10-20 20:41:01 In “Volunteer’s Soup,” Alan Sekula documents the volunteer response to an oil spill off the coast of Spain in 2002. The vulnerability of the volunteer’s body contrasts with the contaminated water – a warning against unchecked industrial expansion? #sleepingbeauties
4908 2018-10-20 20:40:56 We don't need their stinking oil. What kind of country our we that we sell arms to Dictators who in turn murder millions of people, with our weapons.  This is so sick.  All the money in the world can make me choose between what is right and what is wrong.
4909 2018-10-20 20:40:52 Still at fkn walmart in case yall were wondering. 
I DESERVE A DISCOUNT OFF MY OIL CHANGE of something @Walmart.They put cars in front of mine and kept telling me different times of when it would be ready. Its ridiculous I've been here since 12:40 it's 3:40 now

4915 2018-10-20 20:40:25 I'm not against oil and gas I think we will always use it, but not to the extent we do now. I think we may just mine Helium III on the moon someday. I have interest in several oil and gas wells here in Texas I used to raise capitol for independent developers.
4916 2018-10-20 20:40:21 There's so much oil,all over the world, they don't know where to dump it. Saudi Arabia says, 'Oh, there's too much oil.' They - they came back yesterday. Did you see the report?They want to reduce oil production. Do you think they're our friends? They're not our friends
D.J.Trump
4917 2018-10-20 20:40:10 Now we have sphagetti queues for fuel and cooking oil not spaghetti roads. The situation is unbearable. Today a friend was narrating how he got home at 3am coming from a fuel queue along Glenara. How much productive time are we losing? Those in authority shld act now.
4918 2018-10-20 20:40:09 The oil change place remembers me by name now. Yes this is why I come here.

4920 2018-10-20 20:40:06 Oil, the petrodollar agreement and the Rothchilds. Simple. Lets hope China starts buying oil direct of Iran and Russia, then the rest of the world will follow and the USA will be fucked. May be even Venezuela will get back on its feet then.
4921 2018-10-20 20:40:05 I think oil is more important than Jamal.

4923 2018-10-20 20:39:42 "Riyadh is the capital of [the world's] oil, and touching this would affect oil production before any other vital commodity."
Shifts in exploration/production are always possible, esp if Govs/States play minor/no role in channeling/obstructing.
Same w/ means of exchange/currancy.
4924 2018-10-20 20:39:27 We need a few more pipeline explosions and cold people paying $2.50 Ltr for gas lol. Then we will see these idiots support our oil/gas industry

4926 2018-10-20 20:39:13 I will go for a conservative figure of 1,000bopd due to Brockham being deviated.

Oil price $80 - $25 operating costs = $55
$55 x 1,000bopd = $55,000 per day x Angus 65% controlling interest = $35,750per day

So in 1 month Angus coffers fill up by $35,750 x 30 = $1.07 million

4930 2018-10-20 20:38:54 You’d have to wonder if Trump would be as supportive of Saudi Arabia if they didn’t have oil and weren’t mega rich.
4931 2018-10-20 20:38:51 And never grilled!!! 
Just cooked 2-3 minutes on each side in a frying pan with a little bit of Olive oil

4933 2018-10-20 20:38:31 Re previous tweet, I voted Remain and would do so again, but "smug, patronising, neoliberal middle class pish" is right. These tossers didn't care when millions marched against a war for oil, and they don't care to wonder why many working class people voted Leave (or UKIP).

4938 2018-10-20 20:38:17 And not one of them would be using one gallon oil to power their cars and jets. None would be using coal to run cow factories and shopping. So let's keep the cows and work on the 2/3 who don't.
4939 2018-10-20 20:38:12 the best thing about not working right now

and today I bought some canvas' for watercolours and oil paints,  I can't wait to make art again

4943 2018-10-20 20:37:44 You know what Canada needs? More of Saudi Arabia. Am I right? I mean, what’s not to like? Seem like great people. Super ethical. They care about people. And the environment. Basic human rights. I see now why Canada chooses their oil over Alberta and Saskatchewan’s.
4944 2018-10-20 20:37:41 Of course not. Saudi Arabia has had a worse human rights record than many countries we consider allies. Both parties have been whitewashing it in exchange for a stronghold in the M.E.  and access to oil for decades. Just another hypothetical political attack on our President
4945 2018-10-20 20:37:36 Rotfl! More oil to your hairlbow.
4946 2018-10-20 20:37:30 well ok, if you're swimming in crude oil you don't need no inelligence anymore.
4947 2018-10-20 20:37:27 This is madness, escalating the threat of nuclear war to funnel tax money into the pockets of arms manufacturers. It's in the same category as letting oil companies destroy the planet because they're GOP donors. The modern GOP is an existential threat to human civilization

4951 2018-10-20 20:36:51 Not very smart to tank 600k jobs, spike oil through the roof, cause a recession as a result, make enemies of the only stabilizing country in the middle east, allow Iran, Isis, Russia to take over.. All with zero evidence of what really happened inside the consulate. #MAGA
4952 2018-10-20 20:36:46 lol now I’m at good year getting a new tire my tire plugged and a oil change

4958 2018-10-20 20:35:48 POTUS also has to consider our Petro-Dollar situation(Nixon/Kissinger creation1971). That is the essence of our regional oil hegemony that gives value to our Fiat Dollar. Adversary countries are moving away from our dollar and SWIFT system. More to it than you might think.
4959 2018-10-20 20:35:44 It’s hard to cover up Khashoggi murder with oil, money and the most stupid unrealistically tale. Monstrous people lie to protect evil.
4960 2018-10-20 20:35:25 I wrote "Vats love high places." Yes, vats. They're excellent jumpers, climbers and they love to look down on you. Their ancestors were hot oil bearing and emptied themselves onto invading armies. Today you may find them on top of your fridge.
4961 2018-10-20 20:35:15 They really have grown men out here that don’t know how to check or put oil in their car
4962 2018-10-20 20:35:06 _You can't view this message because you don't have cooking oil_
4963 2018-10-20 20:35:00 Based on my brief foray into the 6 or 7 country stations here I am writing a country album "I'm Frightened of New Things". To start:

Track 1: I Never Want to Leave the House Grandaddy Built 
2: What's This Olive Oil Shit Track 3: My Wife Better Be Sittin on the Bed While I'm Out
4964 2018-10-20 20:34:55 Yea Okay lets do something that hurts America. Thats how you get back at Arabs? Dumb people boy o boy. Arabs and Muslims have been killing each other for millennia. Leaders knew this long ago. Do you want oil? then better get use to it. Remember the embargo?
4965 2018-10-20 20:34:54 Also include what Nigeria oil reserves was then and now. Also what the oil price then and now..... You and your likes know who you can deceive. You all should pack one side
4966 2018-10-20 20:34:49 Something like over 90% of world’s extractable supply. Irony is that since these are important for batteries, weening off oil dependence actually makes the world more dependent on China!
4967 2018-10-20 20:34:32 That usually means your hair needs some moisture. I would suggest doing hair mask and maybe putting in some coco oil!!!!!
4968 2018-10-20 20:34:10 He dismembered a man for criticizing him. He has put women in prisons who criticize him. He is a barbarian who talks like he wants progress but really is just a corrupt mobster low life who happens to own MOTIVA Oil and that won't go well. He committed business suicide for sure.
4969 2018-10-20 20:33:55 i cant believe jiffy lube charged me $50 to forget to put oil in my car......... anyways if anyone needs me and my blown out engine u can find us parked on the 101
4970 2018-10-20 20:33:49 They're too used to throwing oil money at a problem and getting someone else to clean up their mess. Now they're on their own and the world is watching. #Khashoggi
4971 2018-10-20 20:33:48 Another advantage of renewable energy, apart from the greenhouse gas stuff, we need less oil so we have to rely on Saudi Arabia less and they will have less of a hold on everyone. Seems pretty sensible to me
4972 2018-10-20 20:33:31 All the more reason to push for #renewable energy. Once we are off oil, the House of Saud will be irrelevant & unable to do things like fund terrorists who fly planes into buildings and dismember journalists. #Putin also loses big time. #Twofer #GoGreen
4973 2018-10-20 20:33:18 Bottom line: The only reason we do business with the Saudis is because they have lots of oil. If they had lots of broccoli, we wouldn't give them the time of day.
4974 2018-10-20 20:33:14 Cause they get access to cheap oil..
4975 2018-10-20 20:33:04 i started using cbd oil and had my first full night of sleep in over a month
4976 2018-10-20 20:33:01 Still not 3000 Barells of oil though a day is it.

And where's a picture of one single tanker?
4977 2018-10-20 20:32:59 sorry you're going through this.  Been there with my husband.  Blew the motor out of our vehicle because he was always the one who took care of them and taking him to treatment out of town, I didn't even think about oil.
4978 2018-10-20 20:32:57 No, you need to explain how Standard Oil was a monopoly despite having many companies that competed with it.
4979 2018-10-20 20:32:46 My dumbass tried to get my oil changed on a weekend. Three hour wait. Yeahhh I’ll see you Monday 
4980 2018-10-20 20:32:13 Trump now saying that the Saudi version of events is "credible"

certainly nothing to do with the big bucks the USA make from arms sales and deals on Oil prices, nothing I tell ya, and that is credible too

4982 2018-10-20 20:31:20 I wish I paid attention when my dad taught me how to do oil changes
4983 2018-10-20 20:31:18 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, or benefits magnet.
4984 2018-10-20 20:31:06 the country is fighting over drilling for oil but we have water issues, wouldn't fix roads or provide adequate drainage
4985 2018-10-20 20:30:59 Germany needs to worry more about 2/3 of their oil coming from Russia
4986 2018-10-20 20:30:54 You don’t think any Leftists have investments in oil?

4988 2018-10-20 20:30:28 I mentioned this exact idea earlier. While this whole event is tragic, it provides leverage to reign MBS in, and push for changes, concessions and support elsewhere (domestic imprisoning rights activists, Yemen, Israel/Palestinian. Oil after Iran sanctions kick in, etc ...)
4989 2018-10-20 20:30:03 #DidYouKnow The largest producer of oil in the world currently is the US. Not Russia nor Saudi Arabia.
4990 2018-10-20 20:30:02 We produce 1.5M barrels a day. We need some pipelines to move this product somewhere other than the US. How many train cars do you suppose it takes to move that much oil.

First of all Allah have taken responsibility of its protection . 

2ndly they have oil 

and 

Thirdly millions of pilgrims visit Saudia every day throughout the year . 

Their economy is strong and will be .

5004 2018-10-20 20:28:53 I think it must be the oil from the clippers that's given me a layer of slipperiness! 
5005 2018-10-20 20:28:36 Have you ever heard of viscosity? Or looked at oil in a car? Either way I'm done talking with you. Was once told never to argue with idiots they drag you to their level and beat you with experience.
5006 2018-10-20 20:28:25 Sadly, everyone in the world now knows how to get what they want from Trumpie.  Stroke his ego, praise him, bow before him, and you get what you want.  "Oh, Donnie, you are so handsome and rich and successful.  May I sell you some "cheap" oil?"
5007 2018-10-20 20:28:11 No they can't, will you stop flying planes and driving cars because of Oil is coming from Saudi Arabia. Their financial interest is more important than the moral.
5008 2018-10-20 20:28:10 It was very tasty! It had some turkey in it, two slices of bacon... an egg... pickled peppers and feta, and cucumbers and lettuce. With avocado oil and lemon juice. Oh and sunflower shoots! 
A lot of it from @SPUDCalgary 
5009 2018-10-20 20:28:01 Only ones with a political agenda are the neigh sayers ...the politicians who have money in oil & gas will always deny climate change
5010 2018-10-20 20:28:00 Use a lil olive oil
5011 2018-10-20 20:27:57 Why would anyone think Saudi Arabia would ever pay a price for anything after 9/11? Fifteen of the hijackers were Saudi. Bin Laden was Saudi. And then there’s the Riyadh attack in May, 2003. So one journalist’s life isn’t going to move anyone to do anything. 
(We need their oil)
5012 2018-10-20 20:27:56 Def gonna do that going forward. Less mess than oil too. 
5013 2018-10-20 20:27:32 What about just ordinary oil?
5014 2018-10-20 20:27:30 One more in class have empty: we are still sealing the oil in the weak dollar!
5015 2018-10-20 20:27:30 CBD Oil.  Look up Medterra online and do a little research on the strength.  Not psychoactive, no THC (if you care), and helps immensely with anxiety (and chronic pain).
5016 2018-10-20 20:27:29 *looks into mirror* 

"she needs some oil sheen."
5017 2018-10-20 20:27:27 เทอหายปัยหนัยมา!!
5018 2018-10-20 20:27:15 Any action towards the Saudis is sure to effect oil prices at the American gas pump. I'm guessing that's crossed the minds of the collective leftists.
5019 2018-10-20 20:27:07 Spaghetti with tomatoes, olive oil, chilli, prawns & frozen peas. Literally as long as it takes of the pasta to cook. 
5020 2018-10-20 20:27:00 and if peak oil is true, they will be out of that soon too
5021 2018-10-20 20:26:59 Keep buying their oil, keep taking their blood money, seems like our national values lately.
5022 2018-10-20 20:26:53 Hey no more tim tams.
Palm oil production sucks when hemp is more productive when it comes to bio based oils.
5023 2018-10-20 20:26:47 Do people drink oil in there?
5024 2018-10-20 20:26:43 Oil change for my baby

5026 2018-10-20 20:26:34 I also was supposed to get an oil change today  I guess next weekend for that
5027 2018-10-20 20:26:24 Kinfini sanifaaa
5028 2018-10-20 20:26:20 I have oatmeal and almond milk with cinnamon for breakfast, and at uni have an oatmeal bagette with labne and vegetables during midday break, and some pistachios. I have whatever my mom is cooking for lunch and if i am hungry around 7-8 i make oil free microwave popcorn
5029 2018-10-20 20:26:13 Got a little parcel in the post from @emmasdiary today with some Johnson’s baby wipes, baby oil and some top to toe baby wash. I had no idea you got sent things! 
5030 2018-10-20 20:26:11 As an IC any and all fee charged to us by uber you can write it off...fuel during driving write it off,mileage to pick up write it off all business realated purchases fuel,maintenance(oil changes,tires,ect.)all tax deductible
5031 2018-10-20 20:25:50 what I grow at home both trim & flower are used I call that being sustainable, making full use of all of my plant materials if you throw yours away or turn it into oil or whatever good for you but I don't see the reason to dis anybody else's practices; grow a fucking brain
5032 2018-10-20 20:25:38 Ndakamira paline reCooking oil
5033 2018-10-20 20:25:24 Why
5034 2018-10-20 20:25:23 Oil dey ur head 
5035 2018-10-20 20:25:21 Jobs in renewables! Forget it oil and gas, my kids need to breath. No on 74 also so you cant suck up my taxes.
5036 2018-10-20 20:25:15 Cooking oil is vegan. Deep fry, deep fry.

5038 2018-10-20 20:25:14 Get the  message clearly, they're not in 1st 10
5039 2018-10-20 20:25:09 Scotland has way more resources than oil. It’s certainly a factor - other oil producing countries manage peaks & troughs. World leading in renewables, food & drink, research & development, Tourism etc. However that’s another argument. This was about comparing Brexit to abuse.
5040 2018-10-20 20:25:04 So what’s your plan to get off oil? Or at least stop wasting it.
5041 2018-10-20 20:24:46 Clump wont impose any punishment on the Saudis he hasnt got the guts and because of Americas reliance on oil due to the Clump cutbacks in renewable energy he cant punish them or the American industrial wheels will cease to turn
5042 2018-10-20 20:24:44 Trump doesn't have the will to place sanctions on Saudi-Arabia because the US would lose in return. The oil embargo of 1973 is a reminder that the Saudis is a no go area for sanctions.Trump is an hypocrite!
5043 2018-10-20 20:24:42 A bit of oil and popcorn... and it starts popping
5044 2018-10-20 20:24:23 A good oil would probably help balance your skin then! :)
5045 2018-10-20 20:24:22 Agree, I guess the resistance might be you can’t control the discussion. Especially when you bring in very unpopular policies like fuel tax or banning oil and gas exploration.
5046 2018-10-20 20:24:21 Lol enjoy alone am not doing
5047 2018-10-20 20:24:05 That would be a Hell of a saga  to write about. “The Real Virgin Olive Oil” None of this crap ass peanut oil used in Germany at @McDonalds
5048 2018-10-20 20:24:05 Diffusing lemongrass oil. It smells like #SandalsResorts in here!

Now I wish I were in the #Caribbean.  #luxuryincluded
5049 2018-10-20 20:23:53 Saudi controlling oil so this can’t be acted on or else oil prices will go up and we will suffer this is the world we live in where the powerful have their own laws
5050 2018-10-20 20:23:47 Tune up change oil na bukas para sa roadtrip :)
5051 2018-10-20 20:23:42 The United States doesn’t rule the world and it not the Police for the whole world either.  They did something awful to one of their own citizens on their soil.  We don’t have any jurisdiction at all. We could do economic sanctions. We may not need Saudi oil but 1/3 of world does
5052 2018-10-20 20:23:31 "...The U.S. Has Two Fundamental Objectives in The Middle - East : Protect Israel, and Keep The Oil, Particularly The Saudi Oil, Flowing, To Fuel The World Economy. "   Source :  Arizona Republic ( Robert Robb )
5053 2018-10-20 20:23:28 Kai UDUS doesn't need all this trash
5054 2018-10-20 20:23:28 If we invested in renewable the same as we now invest in oil it will be economical and infrastructure can be funded with cash from cap and trade. But if you think there is no crisis then there’s no point in non-science based discussion. FF caused this crisis, not sustainable.
5055 2018-10-20 20:23:28 Maybe if he wouldn't stifle alternative energy, we wouldn't need their oil, etc....
5056 2018-10-20 20:23:26 Dogs must be wondering 'is cooking oil that delicious'.
5057 2018-10-20 20:23:26 me? im just out getting an oil change, like a responsible bitch 
5058 2018-10-20 20:23:24 Nah dawg, it’s not credible. Make a deal and get us some free oil
5059 2018-10-20 20:23:06 You mean like CBD only or a THC cap?  Or do you mean like "Bedrolite" Oil?

You may need a new document which is ridic since the oil isn't being made anymore.

5061 2018-10-20 20:22:48 There is a little more to the story like oil
5062 2018-10-20 20:22:37 Mimi’s donors are overwhelmingly corporate PACs.  Big Oil, Big Banks, NRA, etc.
5063 2018-10-20 20:22:31 There’s a gap in your brow bone just above both your eyes, gently apply pressure there and it should ease the tension. Also peppermint oil on the back of your neck and temples.
5064 2018-10-20 20:22:28 Our Natural line uses just five simple ingredients, including palm oil instead of hydrogenated vegetable oils. We offer a variety of products to meet different consumer preferences.
5065 2018-10-20 20:22:27 Short cycle, big breakfast then covering myself in oil. Standard, really.
Now having a pint while waiting for a curry.
5066 2018-10-20 20:22:21 Great band memories of spotty face,  long hair and petunia oil. Loved the Tommy Vance show on Friday nights

5069 2018-10-20 20:21:49 Unfortunately, @realDonaldTrump has expressed satisfaction with "credible" information from the #Saudis. In other words, let's burry this and please bring the money quickly for the #weapons and we want more cheap #Oil those shouting about #JamalKhashoggi will soon shut up..

5079 2018-10-20 20:21:04 Guyana needs Gina Miller it's so corrupted especially now the country found Oil worth billions it would be great if she goes back and fight for everyone to have a fair share of the wealth
5080 2018-10-20 20:21:01 Thank you! I just spray coconut oil in it, and my curls come out!
5081 2018-10-20 20:21:01 The man rarely says anything useful or informative. Why @FoxNews employs him?
What kind of dirt on management @ShepNewsTeam holding onto?
5082 2018-10-20 20:20:56 America still imports billions of barrels of crude oil per day. Kuwait, Iran had already cut down their oil supply to US.

If SA stops that supply, then you would be able to correlate why Trump still loves King and is completely satisfied by MBS over issue of #JamalKhashoggi
5083 2018-10-20 20:20:56 I am not really targeting anyone in particulare, just responding and correcting, if you don't like it you could block me, but if you don't mind we could keep talking Brett Smith. So how has your naturopathic business been going? Selling a lot of cannabis oil?

5086 2018-10-20 20:20:30 Solution: came 100 years ago. It’s called hydrocarbons. Cheap & abundant energy is the fuel of prosperity. Donkeys and horses predates the oil era. Shit, disease and death was everywhere in the donkey years.

5089 2018-10-20 20:20:19 And all the weapons they are using to murder innocent civilians in Yemen are made under US jurisdiction. And so are all the American oil refineries.

5091 2018-10-20 20:20:16 Miles’ son didn’t want to sit still to get his lil mohawk greased, so Miles told him it was “makabuku oil” from wakanda and he was like “ok you can put it on there then” 
5092 2018-10-20 20:20:02 Just banter, nothing serious
5093 2018-10-20 20:19:56 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.

5104 2018-10-20 20:18:27 Full story is : guy dissed some oil sheik. They iced him. US wants to keep billion dollar weapons deal. So the whole thing is being white washed. Any questions ?
5105 2018-10-20 20:18:07 Do you want the oil?
5106 2018-10-20 20:17:57 My ballot just went in the mail. Excited about @PolisForCO and @RepDianaDeGette and Amendment 73 and also 112 because eff oil and gas companies. #denvervotes

5115 2018-10-20 20:17:04 Some do ,  most won't ... 
People like Trump know how to make them shut their mouth ..  Money ,  
Their eyes glow when he mentions the oil money ..  It's the only reason why they don't act the way they should
5116 2018-10-20 20:16:54 ‘Thick oil’ just like bullshit is thick grass lol
5117 2018-10-20 20:16:54 You know what puts your country at risk? The world is becoming less dependent on oil, and that's all you got. Well, that and human rights atrocities.
5118 2018-10-20 20:16:48 I’ve had 6 children and I found with all my babies when there bottom is a little red I used to clean there bums with warm water and a few drops of lavender oil in the water (a natural product as well) then rinse bottom with the water using cotton wool hope this helps :) xxx

5122 2018-10-20 20:16:18 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, yet welfare use will decrease.
5123 2018-10-20 20:16:17 You think this is about a weapons deal.  This is about the free flowing of oil for one third of the world.  The US doesn’t need Saudi oil but a lot of countries do.  Plus the United States does not rule the world!  We can’t arrest the people involved we are not the world police.

5128 2018-10-20 20:15:25 It’s fun to watch Adler flip flop. when he’s talking about exporting oil “oil is to our society as oxygen is to humans. When it comes to bashing a liberal gov, oil isn’t as important.
5129 2018-10-20 20:15:16 They have a chokehold because we need their money, plain and simple.  We have plenty of oil and gas now, but because of the policies of the last few decades.  Not enough facilities to turn them into usable fuels.  Only one to turn natural gas into a liquid to be able to ship it.
5130 2018-10-20 20:15:14 USA will never punish Saudi Arabia. They have too much money invested in this country, oil and they are buying US Warplanes via a huge contract. SD could stop pumping oil and bring the US to its knees because the price per barrel would skyrocket on short supply.
5131 2018-10-20 20:15:07 Khashoggi wasn't an American citizen . Pick your fights wisely. If you really want to go after the audis ..Demand that the 28 pages to the 911 report are declassified..this is chicken feed compared to what the Saudis have done. The other issue is how to secure the price of oil
5132 2018-10-20 20:14:49 CUTE! Find out if that dirt mound was from removing an underground oil tank.
5133 2018-10-20 20:14:42 That first photo looks like a late 18th century French oil painting.
5134 2018-10-20 20:14:24 I don’t know shit about cars. My battery probably finna die. I probably need oil. A tire rotation. Ion even know what that means.
5135 2018-10-20 20:14:03 The six in the olive oil lingers.
5136 2018-10-20 20:14:02 North Korea, Russia and now Saudi Arabia. Potushit is so sympathetic to these countries because he has business aspirations with them. Kushner is his lead ambassador!!! Wake up people you are being duped by a snake oil salesman.  They say and do anything for a deal !!!!
5137 2018-10-20 20:13:56 Kicking, screaming, softly speaking, near our parting ways. We'll go under oil and water, always separate
5138 2018-10-20 20:13:47 It is an international issue. Saudi oil and money has an international greasing effect

5142 2018-10-20 20:13:29 My Gran said that she took cod liver oil because it was good for her joints. And to be fair, she did roll some chronic biftas.
5143 2018-10-20 20:13:21 If someone calls our Canadian oil sands "tar sands",
the conversation is over because they have revealed having drunk the koolaid,
and further discussion of facts is futile.
5144 2018-10-20 20:13:19 sad thing is that Ds like @TomPerez can get in bed with big oil, that Hillary owns stock in DAPL, loves fracking, and yet her base/DNC establishment tweets about being at brunch if she were Prez.
morons! most Dems have contributed to climate crisis & blame Rs for denying facts.

5149 2018-10-20 20:12:30 If your country had got their way where would you be economically? “We’ve got all this oil”. Where’s the oil price now? Answer this question please before I reply to you again. George Osborne said “let them have their independence” Cameron said “I couldn’t watch them drown”.
5150 2018-10-20 20:12:30 Can you imagine what Kentucky is going to do to Tennessee. Can you imagine what Kentucky is going to do the oil.
5151 2018-10-20 20:12:18 Really? And what is your experience in the oil industry? Have you ever been to an oil sands facility or seen the reclaimed land?

5155 2018-10-20 20:11:55 Coincido. Italia afecta más al mercado de bonos. Arabia puede desatar un rally interesante del oil. China trajo números no esperados pero se espera un estímulo fiscal muy alto y Usa entra en proceso electoral. Me preocupa q escale el conflicto Fed Trump porque ahí fuimos en serio

5160 2018-10-20 20:11:38 Switch shampoo every few months. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Eat well. Is it NISIM or NHB? A shampoo to curb hair loss. or similar? I cannot seem to unearth the true and official web address. Had no parabens. It's all natural.
5161 2018-10-20 20:11:35 Okay so, I'm reading what's going to be on the ballot here in Florida, and what do OIL and VAPING laws have to do with each other and WHY ARE THEY UNDER THE SAME AMENDMENT 

What if you agree with one and not the other????? Well sorry Florida voter, you don't get to choose
5162 2018-10-20 20:11:33 moisturize daily, dont use something that has a ton of ingredients,try to not drink pop or coffee, and you honestly dont need any of these toners or harsh chemicals, thats what everyone thinks but you dont, just tea tree oil and wash with cold water. and drink water

5166 2018-10-20 20:11:21 If the requirement is being an egg and oil based emulsion, you could argue that hollandaise is also a mayo by its most basic definition. I'll take my garlic-paste-and-olive-oil upgraded 'mayo' and see you in court.
5167 2018-10-20 20:11:19 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower
5168 2018-10-20 20:11:12 Oh man. The Ukrainian oil exploration loan I'm trying to sell has been such a legend. I can't come to poker tonight.
5169 2018-10-20 20:11:05 Hello Alison. My cold is showing signs of improvement. I used bought dry pasta. Which I cooked, drained placed in a sauce pan with olive oil, peas, herbs and some tomato pasta sauce. Do you like pasta?
5170 2018-10-20 20:11:02 Oh, we're conceding a world price for oil had an impact?  Next, you will admit AB crude reaches Pacific tidewater and is not landlocked?

5174 2018-10-20 20:10:39 Yes, he got into a fist fight, fell into a vat of acid, and was accidentally flushed down a toilet. Why do they even bother with an explanation..they killed him..we need the Saudis because of Iran and their oil. The relationship will continue.
5175 2018-10-20 20:10:36 I don't think Venezuela is a great substitute at this moment lol.

Yes if we fully invested in alternative fuels we'd be less dependent on them for oil.

But. The Kingdom is a very big strategic partner in terms of our military contracts and regional Islamic credentials
5176 2018-10-20 20:10:12 I'm doing an oil painting of my dad and it looks TERRIBLE fml
5177 2018-10-20 20:10:04 When we finally give up our addiction to oil it won’t matter.

5182 2018-10-20 20:09:50 Our old shop is up for sale. Still has lifts, full air system, waste oil burner and 660 gallons worth of oil storage. The floor has been removed and is bare concrete now. Spread the word, this place probably won’t last long on the market.
5183 2018-10-20 20:09:47 never enough coconut oil!

5189 2018-10-20 20:08:57 great to have the bennies from china trade practices, prescription drugs lowering, and opioid addiction/but you would help a much larger percentage of Americans by lowering our fuel costs/heating oil is at #309 per gallon/ fuel is at $2.69 per gallon/you are killing us/especialy
5190 2018-10-20 20:08:48 Sorry to hear you have burns I have heard bio oil is good.  Hope you heal quickly take care.  Love Denise 
5191 2018-10-20 20:08:47 Zimbabwe has 10 universities and an Inovative University of Technologies but can’t produce cooking oil. #Zimbabwe
5192 2018-10-20 20:08:41 The people who buy the snake oil from the traveling salesman always think the salesman was a genius.
5193 2018-10-20 20:08:39 Does Putin want sole proprietorship over oil, and this is the reason for your outrage?
5194 2018-10-20 20:08:33 가만히 볼까..?
5195 2018-10-20 20:08:31 drink water,African soap might irritate your skin,everyday get an ice cube and put it around your whole face, put tree tea oil but you become immune to it if you constantly use it, wash your face with cold water only,dont eat chocolate, dont eat oily things, dont touch your face.
5196 2018-10-20 20:08:29 You make it: tinned tomatoes, black olives, capers, anchovies (though I often leave these out), oregano, garlic, olive oil. Shove them in a pan and simmer until thick.
5197 2018-10-20 20:08:26 They have never been "our partner", as in the American People... you mean the banks and oil corporations... who are the enemy of the people.

5202 2018-10-20 20:08:09 The Muslim world is full of muderous dictatorial rulers with blood on their hands, the Saudis are no different. Stop doing business with them. Boycott the only thing they produce - oil. They either join the civilized world or they can go destroy each other. Why should we bother?
5203 2018-10-20 20:07:57 Boycott of all OPEC oil.
5204 2018-10-20 20:07:46 Yes please oil them up so Juve can screw them easily

5206 2018-10-20 20:07:42 Pay attention: 95% of exports and 50% of GDP were O&G when the oil price crash (not caused by Venezuela) hit. The price crash was caused by capitalist countries. It beggaredcthe Venezuelan economy in weeks.
5207 2018-10-20 20:07:35 Bomfya used oil or Ubunga,nganaukwata Lime even better.

5214 2018-10-20 20:06:38 No... The way to reduce debts is to Stop borrowing!!  Even in our personal lives, you stop borrowing and get a job!  

APC should stop borrowing and create jobs. We have what we need for now... if they are honest with the oil revenue, we can stop borrowing!!
5215 2018-10-20 20:06:32 peppermint essential oil helps so much. also cbd if you’re able to find some at a smoke shop or something!
5216 2018-10-20 20:06:27 It's not a new fossil fuel industry but a development which will push out coal completely as well as reducing oil. Without gas , coal will make a comeback

5219 2018-10-20 20:06:18 All you Liberalcult brainwashed CNN lovers we don't get saudi oil and haven't for yrs lol
5220 2018-10-20 20:06:14 The stuff I bought was prerolled. I don’t think it’s all like that though. I wanted oil but they didn’t have it. I waited in line so long I wanted to buy something.
5221 2018-10-20 20:06:13 Lo que hizo Rajoy con la devaluacion interna para mi fue histórico. No se toma dimension del logro. Ok lo ayudo el QE y precios bajos oil 2014-2016. Pero igual nafta subio 30% y PBI siguio a mas del 3%. Boom en serio ademas con productividad bajisima. El golpe del PSOE cago todo

5223 2018-10-20 20:06:00 Well IF the worst case scenario happened we could remember how we coped in the 70s when we only had electric on 3 days of the week and worked by oil lamps on days without electricity.  Not the end of the world but not great before it got sorted.
5224 2018-10-20 20:05:57 Professor Ignoramus, is oil price suppose to be high in Nigeria? I filled that same 12.5kg for N4800.
5225 2018-10-20 20:05:51 Do you know that a motor oil that lasts twice as long and costs half as much to produce has been around for 20 years but is being blocked by current motor oil companies and is not for sale? It's crazy!
5226 2018-10-20 20:05:42 My skin is dumb dry and the only thing that works for me is oil! And it’s also super sensitive and acne prone and still loves oil :)
5227 2018-10-20 20:05:42 @realDonaldTrump AMERICAN GAS OIL: We have huge gas and oil supplies, so much that we are selling it. If this is so why do we pay so much for propane,gas and oil. Gas is on its way up to $4 this year. Better mileage cars so raise the price of gas.Same electricity use less pay mor
5228 2018-10-20 20:05:38 They don’t have to be sly about anything anymore. Or didn’t you notice? Oil rules the globe. Last time we had an oil man this high up in govt we’re still fighting 2 wars from it.
5229 2018-10-20 20:05:34 Mubashar ,what about the issue regarding civil aviation authority mega corruption scandals and oil smuggling same which you did reveal in your program. We as  pti die heart supporter waiting for action anxiously.
5230 2018-10-20 20:05:21 Muslims with oil are honorary Christians

5232 2018-10-20 20:05:18 Big Country Raw (Thrive) uses coconut base - not recommended for cats and makes one of ours very itchy. Ours was from BC and was in salmon oil. True vets are not writing scripts, and many are not educated in CBD.

5235 2018-10-20 20:04:49 35 minutes after buying your beverage, the ice melts and waters it down. Now you got a Coca-Cola that tastes like motor oil. 
5236 2018-10-20 20:04:48 Trim the infected leafs or it will keep spreading. What fungicide are you using? Don’t water on cloudy days, humidity in your zone is a leading cause. Also try not to water the whole tree top to bottom, just water at the base on days you know are sunny. Also try Neem oil.
5237 2018-10-20 20:04:47 As a fellow IBS sufferer I can confirm that doctors advice is always good. My consultant only recommends peppermint oil now I’ve come completely off my meds 
5238 2018-10-20 20:04:43 Whatever the history, the Saudis have a history of human rights abuses and murder, while holding the worlds economies to ransom to protect the oil trade. Where do you think most climate change propaganda originated? Who stands to lose most from the rise of renewables?
5239 2018-10-20 20:04:38 Because Guyana went through this in the 80's. Trinidad was one of the Caribbean islands that looked on us with scorn thinking their oil wealth would last forever! God told the Jews, ' Be kind to the stranger for you were once strangers in the land of Egypt'. Warning to America!
5240 2018-10-20 20:04:32 Because you consider the paradigm in which we live as a good option. It is far too violent and inefficient to continue of this road. 
$1 trillion/y “defense spending” globally, $1 trillion/y oil industry revenue... these are the compromises many Tesla drivers talk about.

5243 2018-10-20 20:04:00 Mayo and Aioli are both sauce emulsions made of egg, oil and acidity. Only one is served at Maccas and the other is served at places where entrees are on planks of wood
5244 2018-10-20 20:03:59 what kind of body oil?

5246 2018-10-20 20:03:53 I love blending oil colors only, acrylics dry fast and it’s annoying.
5247 2018-10-20 20:03:52 For variety yes. Kevin Lygo is a very smart cookie, but he's working in a different channel now. ITV is an oil tanker which can never really go back to the general entertainment channel it once was.
5248 2018-10-20 20:03:52 China's long arm via Sinopec & other subsidiaries on our Oil & gas sector and it's related services will be a disaster.

5250 2018-10-20 20:03:47 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
5251 2018-10-20 20:03:44 The "discount" is because #tarsands oil is of poor quality and demand is low.  When demand was high, it sold for more.  (Remember $100/barrel?...
Not happening now.) Nothing to do with a #pipeline

5269 2018-10-20 20:01:51 @EIAgov says oil demand will increase until 2040. Yes, demand will go down some day, but we have plenty of time to prepare.
5270 2018-10-20 20:01:51 The relationship with KSA is the strongest it’s ever been. That’s why we got 1000 rigs drilling for oil. And a million or so jobs to do it. The Sauds hang picture of Trump on the highway to idolize him.
5271 2018-10-20 20:01:32 No seas desgraciado, los chinos ya son socios de PDVSA y tu quieres venderles oil a precio subvencionado, que te pagarán en yuans, que tendrás necesariamente convertirlos a $us, perderás también en el cambio o tendrás que importar todo de China, con lo que no tendrás liquidez!!

Do you remember 15 of 19 of 9/11 terrorists were Saudi Arabians and funded by Oil Princes who hated USA? Who needs enemies with "allies" like the Saudis?

Then Dubya attacked Iraq instead of Saudi Arabia? 


5274 2018-10-20 20:01:10 No doubt since the Veterinary industry added it to their list of treatments, it'll now be by script only.  I don't think vets are writing them though!

5277 2018-10-20 20:00:47 Hahahaha!! We joined EEC in Jan '73. Oil crisis '75. Winter of discontent '78. Nice try. The EU came into existence in '92, 2 years after it won the Cold War single-handed. The EU brainwash is strong in this one.

5280 2018-10-20 20:00:21 What about the #killerpalmoil? Real chocolate does not contain palm oil, it’s only cheap, nasty chocolate like yours, Cadbury, Nestle, Mars etc that contains palm oil, it shouldn’t be legal to call it chocolate.
5281 2018-10-20 20:00:13 Chief. Cooking oil is bought daily/weekly/ monthly is RBZ shuts the tap there is no more. If they double our allocation the market will be flooded within 4-10 days. It’s that simple. There is no this breath or that breath it’s quite straight forward.

5289 2018-10-20 19:58:49 Nobody has coconut oil in Lamontville.
5290 2018-10-20 19:58:46 Hahahahaha. Pea sized. Oh my that is so funny. They misspelled palm. I use heavy conditioner, leave-in, and oil.
5291 2018-10-20 19:58:45 I spilled a whole lot of tea tree oil on myself, so if you smell something minty fresh from a mile off, it’s me.
5292 2018-10-20 19:58:37 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
5293 2018-10-20 19:58:35 Guy on the left should spend time building wealth instead of changing oil filters so he can afford to drive something better than that old fucking beater.
5294 2018-10-20 19:58:18 According to OPEC markets
squeezed driving oil price down just like Venezuela
5295 2018-10-20 19:58:17 I smell like shea butter and Moroccan argan oil with roses... 
5296 2018-10-20 19:58:14 Some people use their bum bum to think
5297 2018-10-20 19:58:10 What about people such as myself to have bad anxiety depression etc. etc. and when we use zero net yet we had CBD oil and THC free to our juices what do you think about that and my systen is refillable
5298 2018-10-20 19:57:59 You should remember that the UK essentially created the house of Saud for oil at the turn of the 20th century.
5299 2018-10-20 19:57:47 If you’re fucking raw, use coconut oil instead of Vaseline
5300 2018-10-20 19:57:47 Rich people get richer due to oil which is what the base (albeit not rich) wants.   They worship other’s wealth.  It’s weird.

5302 2018-10-20 19:57:30 After a week of using CBD oil, I’m sold. Since I’ve started, I don’t remember waking up in the middle of the night. I would usually wake up every 2-3 hours. And I haven’t taken a Tylenol for back pains.
5303 2018-10-20 19:57:16 @CrudeOilBrokers Please i need your help to get buyer for crude oil.Feel free to contact me .
5304 2018-10-20 19:57:04 Though probably sends a better message than an oil well... 

I kind of like the use of the bridge.

The only thing Ebsu boys can do after seeing a Funai girl is to retire back to their rooms to wank with PALM OIL.
5308 2018-10-20 19:56:49 I get the impression you own oil stocks. #SiegOil
5309 2018-10-20 19:56:48 The rulers of Saudi Arabia are able to blackmail us because of our addiction to their oil and now they’re owning alot of our debt…And due to our former leaders such as George W. Bush and his family’s close ties with the Saudi family.
5310 2018-10-20 19:56:45 What's the "Blue" plan for healthcare? The ACA isn't working. What's the "Blue" plan for climate change? Many Dems still supporting #fracking and oil/gas. What's the "Blue" plan for voting rights? "Blue" can't even guarantee fair elections in NY where thousands were purged.
5311 2018-10-20 19:56:36 We talked to her about CBD oil. Even her back doctor is not opposed, but she still thinks it is the active marijuana drug. At 86, it is hard to get her to change.
5312 2018-10-20 19:56:36 Specifically, the US Saudi relationship enables petrodollar reserve currency system, & DC establishment afraid to push Saudis away from only selling oil in $ which would threaten their unlimited budget & endless deficits
5313 2018-10-20 19:56:35 1. The bubble is bursting. One by one, Mohammed bin Salman's grand designs are disappearing in the desert, and with them the ambitious claims he made to reform decades of corruption, diversify an oil dependent economy and emerge as Donald Trump's man in the Middle East.
5314 2018-10-20 19:56:35 Simple English question Oga bubu is talking about oil developmental potentiality . Buhari go home and stay with ur grand children 
5315 2018-10-20 19:56:21 We don’t need their oil! USA was fine before Trump! Solar, electric cars &wind power were going strong until #DonTheCon came/brought back dirty coal & oil, GET RID OF TRUMP! #15Saudis took down World Trade Center & 15 Saudis chopped up #Khashoggi  #TrumpSaudiArabia
5316 2018-10-20 19:55:18 He never see anything
5317 2018-10-20 19:55:14 Nothing to do with me being a Liverpool fan though is it?! You’ve just got shitty fans and act like you’re one of the premier league big boys even though it’s all through oil money 
5318 2018-10-20 19:55:13 Yep. It's also a very shallow point. The Yemenis are largely faceless over here. They have no powerful advocates in the media to tell their stories. Few Americans have any connection to the country. The country is poor & produces little oil. Hard to make Americans care.
5319 2018-10-20 19:55:02 Tip, and staff sent home prior to his arrival? But it’s fine, it was not premeditated, just an unfortunate “fist fight”. Oh and by the way w shave lots of Oil Mr Trump....
5320 2018-10-20 19:55:01 The Us dollar used to be tied to Gold. Nixon took Us off the Gold standard. It then allowed unlimited money printing. As long as commodities like oil increased exponentially. Every monetary crisis is created in oil prices. Depression of wages& commodities  = lower inflation.
5321 2018-10-20 19:54:58 I agree their behavior is tied to the loss of oil sales
5322 2018-10-20 19:54:40 Wrong. US won't get involved on this to Jack up OiL Prices.
5323 2018-10-20 19:54:25 the US supposedly produces the most petro energy in the world which suggests that Saudi oil dominance is waning.

5335 2018-10-20 19:53:09 Shut up Kos Omak  Saudi Arabia has been interfering in the sovereign affairs of the US & other Arab nations for decades,  you funded ISIS, played both sides against each other in Iraq, your oil profits are dropping & we know you ordered the murder of #Kashoggi
5336 2018-10-20 19:53:06 Yeah, I just saw that today, actually. Still, I'm sure oil is a primary reason we can't get off Saudi Arabia's dick.

Not to worry, the oil will run out and then the money will run out and then they'll be nothing.

5358 2018-10-20 19:51:07 The problem with the U.S. is our Petro-Dollar status. We must support Saudi Arabia at all costs because of it. Our economy and oil hegemony would collapse without it. We are threatened by our adversaries movement away from the dollar.  Bad times ahead I'm afraid.

5362 2018-10-20 19:50:47 oil is so speculative ...fundamentals sometimes mean nothing ..lol.. but overall yes should be how its weighted

5367 2018-10-20 19:49:42 Had to fix the head light, tighten my battery , now im gettin an oil change then i gotta patch one of my tires
5368 2018-10-20 19:49:39 My question is this: what about the fact that the Saudis own, 100%, Port Arthur refineries and shell oil?  When we talk about the US producing more oil, what does that even mean?  Nothing about our oil, from extraction to refining, is state owned.
5369 2018-10-20 19:49:23 I’m no Trump fan, but I’m not buying this. The Saudis are a brutal regime. They can kill journalists for the same reason they flout our antitrust laws: oil. Unless we suddenly discover that cold fusion is real, I don’t know what serious options we have. All rhetoric is empty.

5371 2018-10-20 19:49:10 You claim you're able to meet demand, and in the same breath you claim Forex constraints are hindering you from meeting demand. 

If Forex shortages persist is it wrong to assume that cooking oil shortages are the new reality

Was so close to killing the Concierge without taking ANY damage. Get him down to 10%, he stunlocks me, kills me through my Ygdar Orus Li Ox, and then kills me outright.

I fucking love this game.

5380 2018-10-20 19:48:10 For decades it was oil - follow the money.  Then Shah overthrown - add ally for regional balance to Iran.  Now that we only import 5% of our oil from SA, it's no longer the oil.  For Trump, apt. sales and God knows what else. 
For Amer. Businesses (like Europe) it's the money
5381 2018-10-20 19:48:05 Oil isn’t only about gasoline for engines. It’s about cleaning products, plastics, clothing, medications, even food items. Oil and trees give us luxuries.
5382 2018-10-20 19:48:03 Yes I’m sure he resisted when they tried to slice off his fingers and limbs with a bone saw. This is outrageous. We were supposed to develop oil and gas in this country so we could be independent of this crap? Well we have achieve that goal. When do we reap the benefits?

5384 2018-10-20 19:47:45 I’ve been sitting in the garage for three hours to get a basic oil change even though I made a legit appointment — I deserve a milkshake after this crap.
5385 2018-10-20 19:47:20 Like @AECBnet's 'Less is More: energy security after oil' report's 'essential electricity' concept, likewise can a sustainably diminished ff industry operate on an 'essential oil only' business model? @lloydalter
5386 2018-10-20 19:47:11 Trump is a snake oil salesman you This Ari, he is unfit to be in the W.H. MC is no saint but he do know how crooked Trump is and he is right 4 more years of Putin destroying Americas democracy is not the way to go. #DonTheCon
5387 2018-10-20 19:46:57 What it all comes down to is you don't actually care about Saudi oil. You just want an export pipeline and you are lying about it to try to shame Canadians to support your export pipeline
If you cared you would be shaming the industry for buying Saudi oil over more ethical places
5388 2018-10-20 19:46:40 Jupiter had his 2nd Seizure today (recovering from a fall), cbd oil helped him recover fast. I love that dude, he is just so amazing. Please send him good vibes.
5389 2018-10-20 19:46:35 Since I didn't attend church regularly I don't have all of it memorized. There was no sage in the annointing oil either? Demons, & evil spirits hate sage. I'm confused.  The only other options I'm aware of is prayer, salt, holy water, blessed objects, & crystals.
5390 2018-10-20 19:46:29 The USA has more oil than Saudi Arabia, hopefully Trump will use it to crush this trouble making, hypocritical evil.

5394 2018-10-20 19:45:55 Let’a not get it twisted: there are two (at least) reasons why NOTHING will happen to Saudi Arabia 1) $10 Billion in arms sales yearly and 2) the age-old reason: Oil. It’s about money, plain and simple

5400 2018-10-20 19:45:26 Obama was friends with Saudis too.  He had to be because he didn't want America to get it's own oil.  It might dirty up the country.  We needed Saudis for energy.  They literally had us over a barrel.  Now it's a matter of fighting terrorism.

I worked in a salad dressings, bbq, marinade, mayo factory. The "light" and "fat free" are not what they say.
5409 2018-10-20 19:44:07 See I have to do water in my hair everyday. My hair doesn’t like to absorb moisture. Like I’ll put oil or something in & it’ll just sit right on top of my head for the world to see

5414 2018-10-20 19:43:18 The biggest mistake America ever made was finding oil in Saudi Arabia, then paying them big bucks for it. Now the Dems suck up to them, just because they have money. Now non-Moslems have to put up with Moslem barbarism and medieval customs. Pathetic. @jeronfnc @realdonaldtrump
5415 2018-10-20 19:42:54 Hello???  WWJD? Would your messiah turn his back on this? 

And the US has business relations - billions in oil $$$ and weapons deals - with the Saudi government. So yes, it IS our business.

5420 2018-10-20 19:42:43 Fair enough...likewise, why should all of Central American issues be placed at the feet of America? Why does it take our money and contributions to help keep many of them afloat? You can’t have it both ways

5424 2018-10-20 19:42:24 Stay away from sulfates. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Towel dry hair. Is it NISIM or NHB? A shampoo to curb hair loss. or comparable. How on earth do I detect the appropriate web address. Really want it. Was sulfate free.

5426 2018-10-20 19:42:14 We all know this, no matter what any of the administrations say. Yet, Americans will remain complicit so long as their wallets aren't hit or they don't have to see oil derricks. We're all about ruining other backyards, just not ours.
5427 2018-10-20 19:42:09 ...thank you! i really appreciate your generosity. the concept of Hyperobjects, and OOO has helped me think about how to think about oil & gas and all that comes with it. i hope i can give you something to read soon that will be worth your time. Cheers!
5428 2018-10-20 19:42:06 Who put baby oil on that ball #MICHvsMSU
5429 2018-10-20 19:41:53 He really is bro I put fish oil in his food too and everything. I’m going to humblenhis ass and buy him pedigree lol
5430 2018-10-20 19:41:49 hucksters, primarily. 

I'd guess, every new, public "information environment," (the post-paradigmatic, new subset of potential legitimate sources) is such a "wild west," where "snake oil salesmen" are a regular feature.

5433 2018-10-20 19:41:20 They aren't fighting in any country bordering the US, so they aren't fighting to keep Americans safe but for the Military Industrial complex and Oil.
5434 2018-10-20 19:41:19 #Canada #Marijuana Yo, @JustinTrudeau! Why can I now not buy CBD oil for my cat who suffers from chronic pain, when it was perfectly legal two weeks ago and is not even psychoactive? Thanks for condemning a lot of innocent pets to a lot of pain, way to go!
5435 2018-10-20 19:41:18 Just like Baluchistan's economy is transforming with building of Gwadar, the economy of Pakistan's Thar desert could transform dramatically with "serious" oil and gas exploration. I urge Pak govt to invest in exploration at Thar. Good prospect exists of finding significant fields
5436 2018-10-20 19:41:15 A lot of people don’t take into account the maintenance of a luxury vehicle when they buy one. Yea, you can pay the car note, but can you afford replacing a $1,800 windshield, $300 tire, or $120 oil changes? If not, you can’t really “afford” the vehicle.
5437 2018-10-20 19:41:14 Renewable energy  has been demonstrated to be key for economic growth.  In addition, the expansion of renewable energy will also reduce dependence on foreign energy sources, volatile oil and natural gas prices on international markets.
5438 2018-10-20 19:41:11 Because they have a lot of oil? Can’t be because they’re fun to be with.
5439 2018-10-20 19:40:59 Sure. It’s a very deep, tangled mess but reducing our dependency on oil and halting arms sales would go a very long way.
5440 2018-10-20 19:40:46 Lmao but sitll buy their oil and send them weapons 
5441 2018-10-20 19:40:42 Sure if you’re reupping on the divine oil
5442 2018-10-20 19:40:42 Because “fuck you pay me” - oil corporations
5443 2018-10-20 19:40:40 Why is everyplace the next Venezuela..to get this Straight...A Democratic governor is going to outlaw tourism and exports of all other goods and base the entire economy on export of oil causing hyperinflation when the price of oil falls...I’ve never been to Disney 
5444 2018-10-20 19:40:39 Tried CBD oil and felt sooooooo relaxed.
5445 2018-10-20 19:40:38 it kinda tastes the way peppermint essential oil smells but its good!
5446 2018-10-20 19:40:34 Would you agree that more off shore drilling on our part and the doubling of effort in fracking would lighten our dependency on the Saudi’s. We could also take oil from Venezuela and the world could sit and watch.
5447 2018-10-20 19:40:32 The oil and gas will run dry and it would be too late to know how much had been taken from you by the royal family.
5448 2018-10-20 19:40:30 Thou shall not kill.
Unless you have 266 billion barrels of oil reserves.
5449 2018-10-20 19:40:29 That sucks & it’s happened to me. Put some vitamin e oil on it.
5450 2018-10-20 19:40:29 ＢＢの変装は本当にすごいぜ！やっぱベテランだけあるよなー！
5451 2018-10-20 19:40:16 I want myself a man that will check my oil and change my tires and pump my gas and the simple things like that. Sure I can do it myself but that looks like effort and acts of love to me, and that’s what I crave. Anybody else???? No??? Ok
5452 2018-10-20 19:40:15 Energy freedom should be our most important goal.  Wind, solar, hydro-power, electric cars, geothermal, and conservation.  We have the technology now.  We need to get it to market and replace fossil fuels for our own safety!  Let Saudi Arabia drink its oil!
5453 2018-10-20 19:40:10 全ての油という油に感謝しているよ。

5456 2018-10-20 19:39:42 They represent what a lot of normals feel, but restrain themselves from stepping outside bounds of "civility," we're told makes us better than them. While the normals in the streets peacefully protesting get crap beat out of them while LE watches passively.

5458 2018-10-20 19:39:35 if he died in a fist fight you call 911 or whatever their emerancy number is you don't cut up the boby and throw it in the woods. @realDonaldTrump believes these stupid assholes "REALLY DONALD" we should just go over there and take their oil if they try to do something stupid.
5459 2018-10-20 19:39:32 Ive seen oil guys who used similar tech in oil exploration talk about accidently causing earthquakes. This is why the FBI vault dropped the Tesla files during the election..so very important.
5460 2018-10-20 19:39:24 Yeah but the oil u produce will cost less than the cost of extraction, good luck then
5461 2018-10-20 19:39:14 Dems are only using this story to create division to cause oil pricees to skyrocket and hurt the economic boom trumps policies have created.
5462 2018-10-20 19:38:56 Red tiger balm for during the day...At end of the day have a bath with Neals yard seaweed and arnica bath oil. Used it when I dislocated shoulder and tore upper arm muscle
5463 2018-10-20 19:38:55 Because they have BROKEN the law by entering our country illegally! I can't steal a car and then demand the dealer give me free oil changes for life! If my father robs a bank, I don't get to keep the money. People can't pick and choose which laws they want to follow!
5464 2018-10-20 19:38:55 Kandoo wipes is where it's at man
5465 2018-10-20 19:38:47 Oil refining is what I'm trying to get back into, the pay is great but it's dangerous as can be, because it's contained bomb 24/7! And and if you want to get some pretty pictures, you can get beautiful pictures at the side of Refinery fire.
5466 2018-10-20 19:38:43 One of my high school summer jobs I left a batch in the fryer too long. Cheese everywhere. Had to drain and replace the oil. Only made that mistake once.
5467 2018-10-20 19:38:37 Y’all talk bout saving the environment, did u know the fashion industry is considered the second most destructive industry after oil? Be mindful of what clothing companies you support, how much you shop and what happens to your clothes after you are finished with them.
5468 2018-10-20 19:38:31 Funny how you could raise a flag with "shahadath" above your head and kill a man so brutally and still the rest of the world just raise an eyebrow cuz you got oil in your backyard! #Khashoggi
5469 2018-10-20 19:38:23 You act as if what the Sauds are doing is new?  The US has dealt with this brutish regime for decades.  Saudi oil sold in US dollars is what props up the US dollar as world reserve currency.
5470 2018-10-20 19:38:22 @sydneybaileyy just asked the guy changing my oil why we need blinker fluid to make our turn signals work 
5471 2018-10-20 19:38:21 Jeebus. What the Saudis have is a major influence on the price of crude oil. Why is this so hard to understand? In Trump’s case, there may also be a strong element of personal/family financial interest.
5472 2018-10-20 19:38:14 Yes, this sucks & won’t work. I’ve tried calling a dozen times & I’m learning that @Budget is an absolutely terrible company as far as customer service is concerned. Are y’all gonna change the oil on the side of the road??????? I’m trying to freakin get to Oregon!!!!
5473 2018-10-20 19:38:08 Bought butternut "noodles" today & used recipe on the package. Baby arugula, toasted pine nuts, olive oil, goat cheese, roma tomato, balsamic vinaigrette. It sounded okay but in reality,...bleh. I'll used tomato sauce, basil, garlic, grated parm, & maybe add artichokes next time.
5474 2018-10-20 19:38:08 Failing small business. Why does 56 percent of all revenue including oil+gas royalties pay for the highest paid public service in Canada. Your out of touch regarding how to operate a small business. Tax burdens are no longer Bearable. Gov comp  out of wack with industry reality
5475 2018-10-20 19:37:54 Pretty sure I’m going to say F it on maintenance for life now..1.5 hours on an oil change is INSANE! My time is more important than a little $ @ford @JimClickAuto
5476 2018-10-20 19:37:46 We just can sell the oil by either gold or  China  currency. Bye Bye petro$
5477 2018-10-20 19:37:44 Woow i really just charged 20 bucks for an oil change and new break pads smh
5478 2018-10-20 19:37:41 You eventually get used to the smell of olive oil. I use to hate it smell too
5479 2018-10-20 19:37:32 Saudi Arabia is not our friend, they are using us to protect their oil
5480 2018-10-20 19:37:31 Might as well get my oil changed while I’m out 
5481 2018-10-20 19:37:20 I’ll answer that with a long diatribe about the greed of the oil industry and their hold on US politicians.....right after I hop in the car to go drive 1/4 mile to pick up a taco.

5487 2018-10-20 19:36:22 You right in the head? That swivel eyed snake oil salesman farage was constantly on the bbc
5488 2018-10-20 19:36:19 Should I remind u he pauperised the northeast when he was their military governor

Someone that established a refinery in Kaduna for a crude oil that is mine a thousand of miles away in the Niger Delta....u think a competent man would do that?

Let's not talk about recession sef!
5489 2018-10-20 19:36:18 How does the sacred oil compare in strength to that of Charlotte's Web?
5490 2018-10-20 19:35:51 And, JIMMY was the very one that told us about a phony "oil" shortage when the crooked republicunt financial & oil "koch"-sukkas started shuttin' down INDEPENDENT GAS STATIONS BECAUSE OF FAKE PHUK'N LEAKS !! AND LOOK HOW MANY "LEAKS" THESE "KOCH"-SUKKAS HAVE CAUSED !!
5491 2018-10-20 19:35:45 You forgot to mention that Saudi owns part of the US debt (I'm guessing 5%), seats on major US banks.  & the lead an org called OPEC, which kinda sets the world's oil prices.  Would also kinda suck if all oil producers suddenly sold in Yaun or Rubles vs U$D... would tank dollar.
5492 2018-10-20 19:35:45 So, you are recommending we steer away to another currency not boosted by the Petrodollar?  

What will you recommend to back and strengthen our dollar?  Do you have any plans?  Do you plan to blame Trump after OPEC puts the squeeze on us?  Will you call for more domestic oil?
5493 2018-10-20 19:35:28 Do any of these nose warmers come with electric heaters?
I mean, propane, wind, or oil fired would be silly, but battery/electric makes a lot of sense.  
5494 2018-10-20 19:35:19 Norway population less than London, economy oil, fish, minerals far more open space than us, high taxes but now moving right. Cannot compare with UK as so different. And much poorer than now pre oil
5495 2018-10-20 19:35:03 I used to take tomato and cheese sandwiches to school for lunch, still love them.  Olive oil, don't like mayo.
5496 2018-10-20 19:35:01 There will be a use for oil for many, many years. But burning it is going to slow down.
5497 2018-10-20 19:34:48 The Saudi government CONTINUES to lie about its role in the torture, murder and dismemberment of this journalist. Until the crown prince is brought to justice America should have NOTHING to do with any of you. Shove your oil.
5498 2018-10-20 19:34:46 Rob McKenna (aka lying transphobic shit sack) represents Chevron Oil -- but his ads against a carbon fee don't disclose that ‘minor’ detail. Take these dishonest ads down @Kiro7Seattle @komonews @Q13Fox @KING5Seattle #waelex
5499 2018-10-20 19:34:46 The DAY we take the POWER of all these industrials (oil, charcoal, mineral, etc ) MONOPOLIES & DISMANTLE THIS CAPITALIST  SYSTEM  with ITS out of order CONSUMERISM & GET RID OF THE WORTHLESS RELIGIONS, MAYBE,  HOPEFULLY the  7 BILLIONS HUMANS will WAKE UP & then SAVE THIS WORLD
5500 2018-10-20 19:34:45 Use a thick layer of coconut oil or castor oil every night before bed!
5501 2018-10-20 19:34:30 …people, started to mess with middle east bc of oil as they smell money, a lot of money. Than they started to mess up in latin america but than it went too far with middle east and they send revenge on wtc, bc of that few new wars was started to make some money on weapons…
5502 2018-10-20 19:34:21 Wow @BrandonJonesRac crashes from the lead. I’m thinking there was oil. #NASCAR
5503 2018-10-20 19:34:16 After a volatile week of trading we find the major indexes trying to find enough footing to head back to new highs. Winners for the short term were consumer staples, utilities, and telecommunications issues. Losers were oil, home builders and semiconductors.
5504 2018-10-20 19:34:07 Can we refrain from using Hall on any Oilers lists moving foward...all it does is make my blood boil  #FireChiarelli
5505 2018-10-20 19:33:54 Two way trade we buy Saudi Oil, they but Military Hardware. It's all good, and we can make up any rational to make it so.
5506 2018-10-20 19:33:49 Lord, your people have more litres of cooking oil in their houses than safe clean water... Your people Lord!!
5507 2018-10-20 19:33:37 I believe the only interference to our oil & gas industry has been the ridiculous sanctions which shut XOM, COP & other great US firms from bidding on contracts w/ Rus' firms.. giving S. Korean firms an edge; moving in on contracts that US firms would have otherwise had.
5508 2018-10-20 19:33:16 If there was an option at the petrol pump for non-Saudi oil, I would take it. Every time.
5509 2018-10-20 19:33:15 Saudis paid Hillary billions to stop fracking if she became Prez
They paid for Matt Damon's 2012 movie Promised Land as anti-fracking propaganda. Saudis are now about to inc oil prices...forcing .plastics & chemical companies relying on petroleum products to return to US #qanon

 “Dan you are on CPP and go to the hospital with an OHIP card." 
- He is for abortion!
 “Women's rights are nothing to make fun of.."
- He is against oil!
"Less smog days are nothing to make fun of. " #cdnpoli
5512 2018-10-20 19:32:38 Unlikely. The impact on England would be significant. We are talking annually around a difference of loss of up to £100 billion Not only will they lose the £28 billion paid by Scottish taxes, they will lose over £40 Billion in Oil revenues, the rest from other taxes. Bye!
5513 2018-10-20 19:32:32 If it’s sinus related I use netty pot solution. If it’s chest related eucalyptus, peppermint, and tea tree in a carrier oil rub it on chest put a hot as you can stand it wet towel then a dry towel over top then a blanket and sit and breathe it all in. Heavenly relief

5517 2018-10-20 19:32:01 Pills are not the greatest method because most of it gets destroyed by your stomach acid. Pure oil is supposed to have the best effect because it is held under your tongue and goes directly into your bloodstream
5518 2018-10-20 19:31:58 Then they would have been colonized for their oil
5519 2018-10-20 19:31:52 Guacamole and carrot sticks. Hummus and toasted pita bread cut into soldiers. Kale and spinach fried quickly in sesame oil and soy sauce. Oh and I just recently discovered zhoug - the best dip/spread in the universe - with pretty much anything
5520 2018-10-20 19:31:47 the free wifi at the dealership was so good that I fell into a YouTube black hole and didn't realize IT TOOK TWO HOURS FOR A FUCKING OIL CHANGE.
5521 2018-10-20 19:31:42 That reminds me, I have to get an oil change. Been awhile since it’s been changed.  Thank god. Night nights. 
5522 2018-10-20 19:31:37 I lived there for two years,without the oil revenues,I'm really not sure what it would contribute to world.
5523 2018-10-20 19:31:30 those saudis aye.with their 911 terrorists,bin laden and journo murdering.lucky for them they have oil.
5524 2018-10-20 19:31:27 dousing that chicken in chilli oil before cooking it was a mistake... I feel like I've been tear gassed  
5525 2018-10-20 19:31:23 Stress can cause hair loss. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Stay away from products with parabens. Is it NISIM or NHB? A hair loss shampoo. or very close to. What must I do to spot the legitimate web site. Need to buy some. It's all natural.
5526 2018-10-20 19:31:14 $47 to fill up my car
$66 for an oil change
$18 for “The Works” carwash
I can’t afford to drive anymore.
5527 2018-10-20 19:31:03 ima have to go get my oil changed way before the day they scheduled me bc my car sound nasty
5528 2018-10-20 19:31:02 im crying i remember when my classmate bragged about how many girls he fucked and this one girl goes "please ur like olive oil. extra virgin" KHJFJFJDJDJ
5529 2018-10-20 19:30:46 Yeahhh
5530 2018-10-20 19:30:35 I'm generally a caffeine only in the morning/daytime kind of person. Last night I had to push through some editing on a deadline. CBD oil and that kind of thing are strictly off-limits because of what I do and my company's drug testing policies.
5531 2018-10-20 19:30:34 My theory is this. 

It’s about Global Warming. 
Boycott Saudi oil. 
Price of gas goes up.
Less gas is burned. 
Less CO2 emitted.

Humanity and Mother Earth saved.
5532 2018-10-20 19:30:26 Kalia got into my essential oil rollers & now she smells like oregano 
5533 2018-10-20 19:30:16 .@RCMPONT is CBD Oil a controlled substance now? It is made from the non-psychoactive parts of the plant and is used in pain control. Our local pet stores no longer sell it, and one Ontario store staff was arrested!!

5534 2018-10-20 19:30:10 They have their heads stuck in the oil money.
5535 2018-10-20 19:30:09 Home rubbing someone's daughter with oil !
5536 2018-10-20 19:30:06 We have 2 very different anti-gerrymandering attempts, one to curb fracking and another by the oil and gas industry to sue the hell out of the state or city's for denying their right to drill. That's just to name a few, lots of important stuff!

5541 2018-10-20 19:29:44 Talk about lack of self awareness and strawman. I note your tweet is superficial, lacks context, and is reflexively partisan, and your response is to double down on the same. Well played. Got it - America is virginal and always good, all Central America issues result of leftism.
5542 2018-10-20 19:29:43 Oil dependency, more than anything else. It's why pushing renewable energy is so important. Not just environmentalism, but foreign policy.
5543 2018-10-20 19:29:39 What person in their right mind would even want fracking within 2000 feet of their home? Fracking pollutes water and a spill could harm and kill agriculture within proximity. Prop 112 is just another way fir the oil and gas people to take in money while killing the environment

5546 2018-10-20 19:29:29 Killing the oil sands by expanding it? We have record high oil production and the oil sands have expanded more in the last three years than it did in the 20 years before.
5547 2018-10-20 19:29:28 in a true free market, we could build a pipeline to a deep water port and sell our oil to markets outside the US, therefore creating competition and improved pricing (I.e. narrowing the spread between WTI and WCS)
5548 2018-10-20 19:29:19 Maybe it doesn't hurt the vessel only when they're still possessed!(lol) by the way the better option: holy oil

5550 2018-10-20 19:28:54 Oil = money = market for arms & convenient counter to Iran (Shiite)
5551 2018-10-20 19:28:48 May Allah forgive and grant him jannah
5552 2018-10-20 19:28:48 I drop my car off at @MavisTire before 12 pm for an OIL CHANGE, tire rotation and brakes checked.   My car is finally ready...but guess what? I'm sitting here waiting because they never changed the oil! Smh...I'm so ready to flip out in here
5553 2018-10-20 19:28:48 For the first in 24 years.. I can see my eyebrows and eyelashes without  enhancement.

5555 2018-10-20 19:28:26 Everyone told me that everything for cadillacs cost more and i didn't believe them. After getting my oil changed twice, and doing my brakes, I see that they weren't lying
5556 2018-10-20 19:28:14 Oil. Oil. More oil. Masses of money. $$$$$$$$$$$$.
5557 2018-10-20 19:27:55 Ugh, my co worker just gave me two free beard oil testers. This day is turning around. It's the little things.
5558 2018-10-20 19:27:43 We boiled him in the oil we happened to have in our kit.
5559 2018-10-20 19:27:40 How far have you go on story? I just finished 7-3 with 3*. Took around 1.5k oil lol
5560 2018-10-20 19:27:23 Make homemade dog treats with peanut butter and coconut oil. Mix it and put it in an ice tray and freeze it. It makes for a popsicle for dogs and is soothing. My dog loved it.
5561 2018-10-20 19:27:18 And baby oil
5562 2018-10-20 19:27:18 anyone: you have such soft skin 
me, out loud: thanks
me, internally: (i use an exfoliating scrub 2-3 times per week and do dry brushing once followed by a soothing aloe wrap and moisturizing cream or body oil massaged gently into the pores while they are warm and open)
5563 2018-10-20 19:27:17 Had a feeling that would be your response 
5564 2018-10-20 19:27:11 Life takes heart meaning RESPECT for all things. You can't make strong focused accurate moves with HATE...its like oil and water 

Then it will take knowing how handle yourself...Meeting the CORE  of yourself so that you can stand through everyone else's B.S including your own!
5565 2018-10-20 19:27:09 Sure, but until then, we’re sitting on a monsterous amount of oil and gas.
5566 2018-10-20 19:27:06 They've gotten away with whatever they want for so long, and they'll get away with this too.  It's disgusting that everyone just turns a blind eye for the sake of oil/money  .
5567 2018-10-20 19:27:05 Gotta get that altar call oil and pray over it 
5568 2018-10-20 19:26:58 Everytime I used black seed oil on my hair I spend at least a minute rubbing it on my hairline in hope that I'm granted a miracle

5574 2018-10-20 19:26:30 $TSLA the oil is getting more expensive, the only solution for your pocket in the long run is buying a Tesla, the American electrical car 
5575 2018-10-20 19:26:14 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.
5576 2018-10-20 19:26:11 WD is not designed to lubricate but to displace water. It will eventually dry to leave a residue that will work as a grinding paste, wearing rather than preserving the cable. Use an oil like LiquiMoly or 3-in-1 at a push

5579 2018-10-20 19:25:56 Heller votes to eliminate healthcare, create massive national debt and cut both medicare and social security. Laxalt is just in the pocket of coal and oil CEOs, not even endorsed by Republican Sandoval. They are just as disastrous as Trump.
5580 2018-10-20 19:25:49 Don't be fooled by this snake oil salesman. He literally said people's wages are too high then gave 87% of his tax giveaway to his fellow billionaires. Trump has DOUBLED the deficit and his bumbling internationally has made us a laughing stock.
5581 2018-10-20 19:25:38 India needs to have fully integrated Oil majors, capable of competing with global oil cos. This deal will only make #ONGC stronger. Urge you all to dig through the numbers & draw conclusions based on facts rather than believing a bigoted politician!
5582 2018-10-20 19:25:29 We have a pipeline to the coast. The existing TransMountain pipeline. All the oil shipped in it goes on tankers to the US. No one else wants it.
5583 2018-10-20 19:25:26 This is the new talking point for democrats, and you have wonder why?? If the Democrats go to far down this road US may see 200 dollar a barrel oil, or worse thousands out of work from defense contractors, and why? Makes you wonder what they are up to.

5589 2018-10-20 19:24:50 From my DM "TM Mutoko is forcing  customers to buy $15 grocery before allowing them to buy 2l cooking oil." #Asakhe
5590 2018-10-20 19:24:48 Why don’t we concentrate on renewable energy instead of oil and gas? Because y’all care more about money than you do about the adverse effects oil and gas has on the climate. Oil, gas, fracking and all that other bs is killing this planet

5594 2018-10-20 19:24:33 Please let us know what you'll do as a Senator to ensure the U.S. is not shamed, and weakened, by our country's response to this horrific murder. There is no $110 billion arms deal pending, we don't need their oil. We need to stand up for American values, and punish #SaudiArabia
5595 2018-10-20 19:24:19 A South African lady once said to us you  can easily identify a Zimbabwean when you ask them to cook. They will first ask for tomatoes,  onions and cooking oil. I was a bit offended, but it's true though. They are a lot of other ways of cooking without those three.
5596 2018-10-20 19:24:10 I think my mom gave up on me coming out of my room NOT covered in oil pastel, oil paint, charcoal sticks, charcoal pencil, charcoal paint, regular pencil, colored pencil, regular paint, watercolor, and 50 different colors of pen ink when I’m trying to draw anyone from MIW…
5597 2018-10-20 19:24:02 70% of revenue of companies listed on FTSE 100 is derived from abroad  meaning they make more money when sterling is weak.

5598 2018-10-20 19:24:02 In November 2017 Zimbabwe was closed for renovations up to 31 July 2018. The inhabitants are  disappointed by the renovations after discovering that the roof was removed and its no longer leaking but pouring. Its  queue after queue in  search of fuel, cooking oil, gas, sugar, etc
5599 2018-10-20 19:23:55 At least this govt has the guts to take the challenge & implement the unpopular steps. Be Demo, GST, solving NPA or IL&FS. And many more. Because of thes reforms, in spite of high oil price & Dollor value inflation under control. Sometimes it's better to utilised ur own brain.

5627 2018-10-20 19:21:14 Oh, if they’re your picks, what you’re saying, is that these folks on your list would also do whatever they can to ruin the Canadian economy & allow our oil to be sold to US for cheap while allowing the rest of Canada to import oil from a murderous Saudi regime #transmountain
5628 2018-10-20 19:20:54 When gas oil comes in two ticks vs when it goes out 2 full ticks! 
5629 2018-10-20 19:20:52 So many things , shea butter , coconut oil , vanilla , etc
5630 2018-10-20 19:20:52 Israel wouldn't exist if Egyptians, Palestinians and Syrians had the oil wealth the khaleejis do.
5631 2018-10-20 19:20:45 So, no, the Saudi’s definitely do not have the respect of the Canadian people. You are very wrong.  We don’t want anything to do with you. Only the politicians are interested in your oil. That’s it.
5632 2018-10-20 19:20:38 Don't put the blame on us. 
The youths are not in power. 
The youths are not the ones using crude oil or other natural resources money to finance terrorism or civil war.

5639 2018-10-20 19:20:04 The anger must produce something substantial. The Saudis are not, and have never been, our allies. Without oil they’d all be goat herding nomads.

5662 2018-10-20 19:17:23 Depends if you can do some things yourself. If not they will replace all major fluids like your brake fluid and oil.  They should replace your air filters cabin and engine. Maybe rotate tires and all other things are vehicle specific.

5665 2018-10-20 19:16:57 Arghhhhh! How is this man the president of Nigeria??

How does oil companies potentially prospecting in Nigeria for forty years answer the question about corruption thrown to him by his interviewer?

IM ASHAMED
5666 2018-10-20 19:16:46 Don’t forget that the Iranain’s oil price It’s much higher than us 
5667 2018-10-20 19:16:41 Did you know there's dozens of Afiricans hanging out in the streets of Tijuana trying to figure out a way into the US? You don't think others aren't going to join in the caravan along the way? Don't be a fool.

5671 2018-10-20 19:16:07 Pretty frigging accurate I never dreamed I would say this about an American President, but he fits right in with those monsters. It's time to break away from our oil dependency on the Saudi’s & the Middle East in general Then we need to break ties financially. Then tell’me to FO!
5672 2018-10-20 19:16:03 Or what species were displaced by the farms from the food he eats, what habitats were destroyed by the oil industry he supports, or even what species were forced to move when the cell phone companies put up his cell towers?
5673 2018-10-20 19:15:54 We had some sun dried tomatoes in olive oil that I threw in there while it was simmering, it came out good.
5674 2018-10-20 19:15:52 OK, next time I'll add oil.
5675 2018-10-20 19:15:50 So does CBD oil
5676 2018-10-20 19:15:47 The Saudis have owned us since oil was first discovered in their desert, we're just playthings to them. They know it doesn't matter how many times they mistreat us, we will keep asking for more punishment. Dysfunctional relationships is the American way.

5683 2018-10-20 19:15:05 The processes they are now using to lower their impact is absolutely amazing. Most operations are now using far less land and leaving a majority of the forested areas undisturbed while still collecting the oil below

5686 2018-10-20 19:14:33 Trump selling more snake oil
5687 2018-10-20 19:14:30 Often forgotten that FG/Lab govt has a massive give away manifesto too. 

it went wrong with the second oil shock, which again would've hit any govt that had been elected. The FF manifesto wasn't great in 1977, but neither was the sitting govts.
5688 2018-10-20 19:14:26 It doesn't hold oil...
5689 2018-10-20 19:14:14 It is literally tar, tho. It makes oil, but tar is it’s natural form in the ground, sometimes mixed with sand etc.
5690 2018-10-20 19:14:00 Maybe wait for oscars season! We don’t know what kinda looks she’s gonna serve! and paintings take time to make y’all ESPECIALLY oil. Those take days to fully dry 
5691 2018-10-20 19:13:59 I wanna put some baby oil on this girl ass tell to bend over on the edge of the bed so they ass hanging off and eat it from the back.
5692 2018-10-20 19:13:53 use of hair oil or beard oil gives smoothness 
5693 2018-10-20 19:13:45 Teams playing Man ‘we have achieved absolutely nothing without oil money’ City this season.  Work hard, work hard, work hard, concede a goal.  Oh well, who do we play next..can’t be bothered with this game anymore
5694 2018-10-20 19:13:42 That's all you do lmao. Mix coffee grinds and coconut oil 
5695 2018-10-20 19:13:36 Just woke up let’s get this yeast to dissolve in warm water. Add sugar, salt, oil and 3 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to form a soft dough.
Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 8-10 minutes.
5696 2018-10-20 19:13:36 The smell of lavender oil now makes me run to rewatch Outlander for the bazillionth time. Just not THAT episode.
5697 2018-10-20 19:13:35 I just use tea tree oil
5698 2018-10-20 19:13:22 More sour than sweet I would suspect.
5699 2018-10-20 19:13:07 Not really, batteries require a lot of energy. A better green solution is algae oil vehicles. The algae sucks up CO2. Another healthy idea is depopulation.
5700 2018-10-20 19:13:03 Screw that..they should have a separate bldg for oil changes...in and out...oh wait.. that's what Honda had...lol..still didn't work for me.
5701 2018-10-20 19:13:00 I have to go get an oil change for my car....I don’t like going by myself 
5702 2018-10-20 19:12:53 I Fr need to learn how to do my own oil change 
5703 2018-10-20 19:12:52 What consequences? Bombing Yemen will continue, the US will continue sell weapons of destruction to them and import their oil. What consequences? There are no consequences. Not even the vote can help because voter suppression has been green lighted by the courts. A mess.
5704 2018-10-20 19:12:38 this wonderfully viscous oil has no fear, completely unstoppable [not clickbait]
5705 2018-10-20 19:12:33 What was the bench mark used for the budget? If you plan a budget on $50/barrel and you end of selling oil for $80/barrel, it means you have extra money based on your plans. You can now divert this surplus to other sectors not well funded. This is why we have supplementary budget
5706 2018-10-20 19:12:28 Sobrang bango ng Sakura na oil para sa diffuser. Amoy freshly ironed cloth 
5707 2018-10-20 19:12:22 Oil my beard for me so I know it’s real
5708 2018-10-20 19:11:48 What do you expect from the Saudi Arabia? They got Ireland, Belgium, Sweden and other EU countries to elected them to the UN Human Rights Council. That must mean that they couldn’t have done this....doesn’t it? The whole world has turned a blind eye in favor of oil. @HillelNeuer
5709 2018-10-20 19:11:44 Only thing you're focused like a laser on is taking down Trump.
You and other dems are so eaten up with hatred over Hillary losing you've lost your way, no longer represent the people.  
Youre blind, don't even see the socialist left that's eating you alive
5710 2018-10-20 19:11:40 Tories only have one goal & that is to keep lowering taxes which can only be achieved by cutting public services to pay for them and for that they alway have an excuse -1979 OPEC oil crisis so inflation was Labours fault so austerity was needed to cut inflation & 2010 say no more
5711 2018-10-20 19:11:18 Pain certainly tests us. I’m glad CBD oil is helping you
5712 2018-10-20 19:11:13 If you call our Canadian oil sands "tar sands", I will correct you. Its oil, not tar so quit using the enviroterrorist thug term
5713 2018-10-20 19:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza this Spring Sampler will be: no crust with fresh motor oil and arugula.
5714 2018-10-20 19:11:01 Getting my oil changed within an acceptable timeframe. I may be almost 33 but today i’m offically an adult.
5715 2018-10-20 19:11:01 Love oil cleansers. Swear by them. And help to combat my oily t zone. I want to try the shu uemura one was well
5716 2018-10-20 19:10:51 @foreignoffice your statement regarding #Khashoggi  death is disappointing. 

I use to think I’m safe in the Uk, but I’m now considering my options, I could be murdered in an embassy in your country and similar statement would be released because of oil money.
5717 2018-10-20 19:10:44 You stole my lamp oil AND my rupees!
Bombs is all i have!
5718 2018-10-20 19:10:43 What’s a lap dance without baby oil 
5719 2018-10-20 19:10:41 Yeah, but now we can pretend it wasn’t a state assassination, and continue to sell arms and buy oil like nothing ever happened
5720 2018-10-20 19:10:39 In fact there are a number of curries that are better made with oil, but nothing tricks visitors into thinking you cook well like using plenty of butter.
5721 2018-10-20 19:10:36 Lots of natural cashews and tamari and tofu that’s ready marinated.   Gorgeous home made soups ( I taught Maria my butternut , sweet potato   &  .  Roasted veg like aubergine  tomatoes  and squash . Gem squash in season gorgeous chopped in half roasted  olive oil . Enjoy
5722 2018-10-20 19:10:33 Just bought 2 degrease an oil filter for $72 and the  you want those guys to be paid $20... They'll run away from you

5724 2018-10-20 19:10:28 Saudi Aramco veya resmi adıyla Saudi Arabian Oil Company, dünyanın en kârlı şirketi
ABD'li finans kurumları halka arz edin diyor ama Suudiler istemiyor.
Çinliler ve Ruslar halka arz etmeyin; ne kadar istiyorsanız biz verelim diyorlar.
Kaşıkçı olayında Saudi Aramco nerede?
5725 2018-10-20 19:10:20 見回り行ってきまーす！
5726 2018-10-20 19:10:04 夏とかTシャツに油のシミできるよねえ。あれ透けるからほぼ全裸みたいになるよ僕。
5727 2018-10-20 19:09:55 To early getting the oil change in the truck
5728 2018-10-20 19:09:49 $30 FOR AN OIL CHANGE? WHAT WAS U DRIVING? LOLOL
5729 2018-10-20 19:09:42 Oil
5730 2018-10-20 19:09:39 Oil... Until that drys up you should realise that everything else is irrelevant..
5731 2018-10-20 19:09:29 They were ottoman territory for 400 years, saudi took them with betraying ottoman for christians, saudia is disgrace of muslim community, u let hilton to build skyscrapper next to kaabah, you were with  israel about jerusalem, saudia has nothing except oil, which is not limitless
5732 2018-10-20 19:09:18 One day your Oil will dry up and we won't need  you and your country anymore!
5733 2018-10-20 19:09:14 bros, I dare you not to use "Anointing oil" on your head before you sleep tonight!

You will wake up just fine. Nothing will happen.
5734 2018-10-20 19:09:03 We sure do. It’s not all about oil! We have lots of other resources
5735 2018-10-20 19:08:58 Two guys come up to my oil paintings

Guy 1: $260
Guy 2: WHAT?
Guy 1: yeah, two hundred and sixty dollars 
Guy 2: WHY?!
Guy 1: *huffs a laugh*

Like I’m sorry a canvas costs $30 and the paint costs $20 a tube, and they take me hours and hours to make??? Yes. $260.
5736 2018-10-20 19:08:57 I believe that.  Where there's money and oil. America will be there "liberating"  them.
5737 2018-10-20 19:08:51 Take it from an insomniac who has written thousands of words on sleep deprivation: coffee ONLY in the AM, regular bed time and CBD oil. That stuff’ll put you out like a light without all the insane side effects of sleep drugs.
5738 2018-10-20 19:08:48 @UN Yes because USA need oil and selling of weapons to Saudi that is why Jamal Khashoggi"s will not brought to face justice.
5739 2018-10-20 19:08:42 I think the Rock Oil patch gives it away as GK.
5740 2018-10-20 19:08:03 If you burn anything, you produce carbon. With solar, wind, fuel cell, once you have you don't make carbon. The byproduct of fuel cell is water. There's a university in Britain trying to fly Airbus on hydrogen. For foam, plastic Kevlar etc we need oil but cut pollution for end us
5741 2018-10-20 19:07:37 just witnessed @Stu900 average 251 in the stepladder finals of the Tulsa open on @FloBowling  making it look easy even tho there was two different oil patterns on the two lanes, congrats to your second title!
5742 2018-10-20 19:07:28 Yaasss!!!! I LOVE their lip stuff and dewy skin mist. I haven't tried their face oil yet, but so far, those are the only 2 things from them I can use! Even the Silk Moisturizer wasn't hydrating enough. 
5743 2018-10-20 19:07:10 The Saudis have owned all our Presidents since the oil crisis of the 70's... from Reagan to Bush to Clinton to Bush to Obama to Trump.
Nothing will change till we vote third party.
5744 2018-10-20 19:07:08 It's simple-----OIL!!!
5745 2018-10-20 19:07:06 We don't need their oil but they are a key ally against a far more dangerous Iran.
5746 2018-10-20 19:07:03 I hope @realDonaldTrump, @SecretaryPerry, @SecPompeo et al. are working hard for a backup plan to Saudi Arabia for when Iran oil sanctions kick in early next month.
5747 2018-10-20 19:07:00 Exactly. Honestly this can be a real opportunity for behaviour change to be healthier. Just need a zim celeb to start a trend of. Sorts but aah we like our sugar and oil and driving kuma grocer..  
5748 2018-10-20 19:06:42 Make sure you are getting CBD oil and not hemp oil in disguise. Research the suppliers a bit.
5749 2018-10-20 19:06:42 It’s winter go for beautiful stews with vegetables, quorn , loads of fresh herbs , served with lemon , garlic , parsley couscous.  Buy a good olive oil like the proper Greek olive oil my favourite Waitrose EV Greek olive oil ,  lots of gorgeous pies to make & stir fries.
5750 2018-10-20 19:06:40 Oil change: 
5751 2018-10-20 19:06:30 In some cases. Some stews are boiled. Like mooyoh stew.... palm oil based fresh fish stew
5752 2018-10-20 19:06:30 Two Trillion + debt, Deficit.. Would the Unionists who are so keen dismantle Scotlands economy be so kind as to explain where does rUK replace revenue from Oil,Whisky,Salmon,Wind,and everything else Scotland puts in..
5753 2018-10-20 19:06:25 Tune up, oil change prob check tires and fluids check.
5754 2018-10-20 19:06:15 I've been a devout follower of the parchment paper for years! Here's a parchment paper blessing for you: line a baking sheet  Spread some italian blend cheese. Sprinkle on salt and pepper. Anoint with olive oil. Bake until the cheese is divinely crispy!
5755 2018-10-20 19:06:04 I'm not triggered I'm just informing you of your mischaracterization of Canadian oil and wrongly referring to it as tar
5756 2018-10-20 19:05:45 เนี่ยร้องไห้แล้ว นุกินชาบูวววววว กลับมาสี่ทุ่มพอดีเค้าเริ่มเกมส์แล้ว งื้ออออ
5757 2018-10-20 19:05:43 Cannabis seeds are very healthy for u also what mostly controls pain is part of you're endocannabinoid system so if its not unlocked you're body can't do its natural nutrient uptake to heal naturally so by not using some cannabis oil daily essentially keeps u in pain
5758 2018-10-20 19:05:35 Hello. Am I able to refund this then? It’s a body oil. Thanks
5759 2018-10-20 19:05:32 Can I just mention a little something called Yemen? Saudi oil has bought them a lot of carnage.
5760 2018-10-20 19:05:30 Sharja is a palm oil soup here

5763 2018-10-20 19:05:11 Can u suggest how else thy could have raised money to run d country considering how low oil was selling?
5764 2018-10-20 19:05:05 Have you seen the president? They don’t think Americans will believe anything, the believe that Trump won’t do shit about it and that Americans are so dependant on Saudi Oil that they don’t need to care.
5765 2018-10-20 19:04:54 Oil.
5766 2018-10-20 19:04:51 Totally high on oil based primer fumes right now AMA
5767 2018-10-20 19:04:50 Oil price more important
5768 2018-10-20 19:04:49 今日も楽しかったなぁwさて、寝ようzzZ
5769 2018-10-20 19:04:43 Oh my, your magic space rock, so jealous. What will we do without it?

It's a fucking monument built to a rock. It only matters in the imagination of people indoctrinated from birth to buy that shit. So you've got oil, and a delusion. Congratulations, what an amazing country.
5770 2018-10-20 19:04:36 Depends on the job tbh. They had done some doors in the satin so I had to get the same but yes on trim paint that’s had a few knocks I find oil better. Was wandering if solvent was just oil based although it has a quicker cure time
5771 2018-10-20 19:04:32 We also put earl in the truck not oil
5772 2018-10-20 19:04:28 Midnight Oil - Beds are burning
5773 2018-10-20 19:04:19 Why is that? Is the oil that important? Is it something else? Easy to say Trump does it to line his own pockets but I’d expect a similar response out of the last 3-4 presidents.
5774 2018-10-20 19:04:15 Also stop sending China money.  If we don't buy their oil China will
5775 2018-10-20 19:04:09 What are you talking about?? It makes ZERO economic sense. We're importing oil at $70 a barrel from Saudi Arabia and selling at it at $25 a barrel to the US because they're the only accessible market. Build a pipeline and open up an alternative refining market (asia).
5776 2018-10-20 19:03:56 John McCain.  
You didnt want reform then, you dont really now.
Just like immigration is not about humanitarianism or compassion, neither is this.
It's all a political tool to be used for POWER.
5777 2018-10-20 19:03:55 I know what you mean, nobody wants that poison ink in their hair. It can really ruin your day.
Try not to scare the pharmacy staff, they are nice people despite their robotic urge to sell bath oil and mis-matched make-up.
5778 2018-10-20 19:03:49 it dries out your oil glands, thus not producing acne, i agree it did dry me out, but it was manageable.

5783 2018-10-20 19:03:27 It’s good to not itch and always keep belly hydrated I asked the ladies at ulta the best thing for pregnancy skin stretching and they suggested the bio oil. I’ve used it since I found out I’m pregnant it has a lot of vitamins to help with elasticity in skin def worth it only $7!
5784 2018-10-20 19:03:22 I'm a Latino that actually lives in tx... 

Im worried I know more Latinos that are Republicans than Democrats and just because he's Latino means zero to them. 

These people range from law enforcement to the oil fields. 

These aren't the kinda people who use Twitter.
5785 2018-10-20 19:03:17 Dm your number so I can call you.

5788 2018-10-20 19:03:01 Young people should use lawsuits to protect their future because politicians accept $$$$$ to postpone needed laws the world knows are necessary to reduce carbon effects on the air we breathe. Is Sessions pushing this? Does he care more about oil money than clean, breathable air?
5789 2018-10-20 19:02:23 as a tech witch, i need an oil diffuser usb
5790 2018-10-20 19:02:07 If they keep digging like this, they’ll strike oil in the middle of Istanbul.
5791 2018-10-20 19:01:59 Dr. Peterson, a very common scenario these days is for patients to take their prescribed medicine as the whim strikes, and to regale me with the long list of cleanses, supplements, and essential oil treatments they have self-initiated. At this point I just shrug.

5796 2018-10-20 19:01:44 Venezuela apparently has more oil reserves than SA. How about backs turned on the Saudis. Good for Venezuela, and maybe the Saudis night not be able to pay billions for arms etc.

5798 2018-10-20 19:01:31 No, not the same thing, the term tar sands is a derogatory term used by environmentalists trying to keep our oil from getting to market by falsely claiming its dirty
5799 2018-10-20 19:01:28 Today I saw my brilliant pal @playdoctorduffy’s Arctic Oil directed beautifully by @gaznicholls. How hopeful and brave and refreshing to suggest we listen to and care for each other as an answer to surviving the climate apocalypse that approaches.
5800 2018-10-20 19:01:26 I guess you prefer oil U/C’s & oil top coats then ?
5801 2018-10-20 19:01:22 They’re buying time so that trump can be directed by the oil loving Koch brothers on what the next controversy should be so that Yemen continues to be bombed and oil keeps flowing in one direction, from s Arabia to America. Hello inverted totalitarianism
5802 2018-10-20 19:01:14 Went for an oil change, left $380 poorer. 
5803 2018-10-20 19:01:13 Green peace and those who might know:  Where does Canada get the oil it consumes?  I really want to know.
5804 2018-10-20 19:01:12 You’re right sir, I don’t give a shit about your murderous regime of a country. As a matter of fact, I’m hoping that once the congress changes hands, we fund renewables, stop allowing oil to be refined here and finally destroy the House of Saud.
5805 2018-10-20 19:01:07 I've picked up my car from the shop, returned my rental, done some returns at a retail store, sat on the phone with Amazon, and now I'm getting an oil change. 

I'm done adulting. I just want to watch football.
5806 2018-10-20 19:01:05 spilled canned tuna oil on my foot and now i wanna die
5807 2018-10-20 19:01:02 That doesn't qualify as a mistake. It's just the nature of hot oil to explode. It's ur duty to be careful.
5808 2018-10-20 19:01:01 어릴적엔 부모는 나 없어도 잘 사실것 같았다 하지만 내 동생은 나 없이는 하루도 못 살것 같은 어리고 나약한 존재였다 그것에 대한 보호본능 소중히 여기는 마음 커서도 사라지지 않는다

5816 2018-10-20 18:59:42 How many years was Steve Sidwell at Chelsea and how many appearances did he make? From 2005 until Man City got the oil cash Chelsea bought every title, nothing truer in football.  I could have signed for Chelsea, at age 15,  but it’s still a horrible racist football-club.
5817 2018-10-20 18:59:40 Raj stop buying imported beer from the supplier! It’s not a radical option, it’s the logical option!!

5821 2018-10-20 18:58:47 This.  When we have 54k active oil and gas wells in CO & actively growing of which you want to expand despite the significant impact to climate change. Climate scientist urge no new wells no new fossil fuel infrastructure & immediate drawdown of existing fossil fuels. #corruption
5822 2018-10-20 18:58:42 Don’t take yourself so seriously. None of us do.
5823 2018-10-20 18:58:37 For 80yrs since US geologists found  Saudi Arabia's 1st giant oil field we've cooperated with the House of Saud in an often uneasy relationship owing to the religious zealotry of Saudi Wahhabists. This act of murder & now their lies by our #2 Middle East ally has shown DJT=coward
5824 2018-10-20 18:58:33 I’ve gone down the oil cleanser (simple), foam cleanser (dermalogica) , pixi glow tonic, facial oil and a gel moisturiser or a moisturiser with SPF. And every other day a retinol eye cream. Sounds a lot but actually quite quick to do.
5825 2018-10-20 18:58:31 Oregano oil!
5826 2018-10-20 18:58:23 Cut the cord. Do yourselves a favor. Get off oil, it’s a non starter with job creation, the green economy produces way more higher paying jobs. All you Koch supported initiatives are destroying the country and inverting democracy to a pale and shriveled leaf.
5827 2018-10-20 18:58:09 Where does Canada get the oil it consumes?
5828 2018-10-20 18:58:04 Yea free oil changes are included duration of lease but its not even worth it at this point. 2+ hrs wasted on a saturday

5830 2018-10-20 18:57:55 Last night was the first time I ever changed my car's oil and rotated its tires by myself. Hence, be prepared for many casual flexes that begin  with, "Yeah, I was working on my car and doing really manly shit the other night... "
5831 2018-10-20 18:57:43 Just dab on that oil
5832 2018-10-20 18:57:39 Went to get my sister’s car oil change, the people r really nice
5833 2018-10-20 18:57:37 Android phones are mostly oil fingers, immediately you get 4G, That's when these apps shows up to upgrade them.
5834 2018-10-20 18:57:37 How much of this “aid” gets kicked back to soy boy? The Middle East needs to solve its own problems and Canada needs to work on energy independence to extricate itself from the corrupt OPEC group - plenty of oil and natural gas to harvest! #NoMoreLiberals

5848 2018-10-20 18:56:35 I hate to say this but Eric is right. After decades of Middle East politics the US is now in this situation. Just think of the oil embargo of the ‘70s. We should have cut ties then but because of the oil and $$$ we didn’t. Saudi’s can do whatever as long as there’s $$$$.
5849 2018-10-20 18:56:25 No. You would just be burning oil which is what plastic is. A dumb idea.

5851 2018-10-20 18:56:22 You're  complaining about Saudi oil when the NDP are the only party supporting refining here to displace imports. 

You're complaining about Saudi oil  but claiming to support the free market that imports Saudi oil.

You're full of contradictions.

5863 2018-10-20 18:55:01 I feel like I should look into #minimalism as I always feel the need to have back ups of simple things in life, e.g. a 2nd bottle of oil in the cupboard in case I run out of it one day when cooking...so my flat is way too crowded...any suggestions about where should I start?
5864 2018-10-20 18:55:00 @paulwallbab my gma found a oil painting of you.......it's in her living room.
5865 2018-10-20 18:54:58 Like with like? As in a European county that has oil? That doesn't make Norway and Scotland the same because they share those 2 characteristics

5867 2018-10-20 18:54:45 The human rights issues have been spoken about for decades about Saudi Arabia, no one usually acts on it because they supply most of the oil to America, so the Americans are in a catch 22 when it comes to Saudi Arabia.
5868 2018-10-20 18:54:42 We need their oil and we need them to buy the weapons we manufacture.

5879 2018-10-20 18:54:03 You are in danger of going in the wrong direction, you know the rules - less than 10% of PF in AIM.  That means, of course 90% of your wonga in something that is going to pay dividends.  And, you need to have received the divi income before you start "playing" AIM.

5884 2018-10-20 18:53:26 If you have solar panels and batteries, it is practically free. You just paid overhead to free yourself from reliance on oil/gas/coal.
5885 2018-10-20 18:53:20 RT Progressive_Pol: We need to have a serious discussion about seizing assets of oil execs who lied/concealed climate data, systematically, for years.

5898 2018-10-20 18:52:09 I’m teaching Hunter the finer points of oil changes as well. Like: “Hey, fucko, it’s a Porsche, so Mobil 1 or I’m gonna stomp your face with golf spikes.”
5899 2018-10-20 18:52:07 Then Utah sold it back to the Federal Government so Tillerson could move in Big Oil. Now, it’s in all kinds of court cases and everything is on hold.

5911 2018-10-20 18:51:13 You mean tough like imposing sanctions against Russian oligarchs and intelligence agencies, bombing Russian solders in Syria, selling lethal weapons to the Ukraine to defend against Russian encroachment, castigating Germany for it’s oil deal with Russia...
5912 2018-10-20 18:51:04 Wait.  So now we're saying I only won because they were GIVEN to me AND it was a mistake?  Like 8-10 times including the 1 recognized by JJ himself after the show ended?

After 200 years of burning oil no one can think of a better way to spur growth and development? It's just sad

5923 2018-10-20 18:50:07 The grade of oil from Alberta is called Western Canadian select. WCS. It’s a very heavy oil because it comes from the tar sands. Brent oil is the international contract.
5924 2018-10-20 18:50:05 Trump could suspend arms sales to the Saudis ($150 billions) putting 'Merican jobs at risk. Whatever "severe action" he takes against them will result in the Saudis either flooding the market w/ oil, driving the price down, or some equally egregious reaction.
5925 2018-10-20 18:50:01 There’s nothing wrong with running a deficit as the UK and most other European countries (except Norway with their oil fund) run them. They also have control over all the economic levers including ‘printing’ money, et al.
5926 2018-10-20 18:49:54 You should reread the Article by the Hill again. Obama declared the land part of a National Park with GOP support because he knew Tillerson/Trump would be going after it for oil profit purposes. Trump reversed it with GOP support ($$$ changes everything) and have it back 2 Utah.
5927 2018-10-20 18:49:52 I think it will, especially where higher reliance on Mideast oil - China, India, Japan, South Korea have got to be concerned.
5928 2018-10-20 18:49:34 Past time. I’ve been calling them our drug dealer for years. Oil is the drug poisoning our country! They have NEVER acted like an ally, much less friend!

5937 2018-10-20 18:49:04 You must remember UK pays you £17 per head per week  and when oil prices drop your economy drops what is your budget deficit for this year the Scottish people deserve better Scotland is beautiful country and has great people

5939 2018-10-20 18:48:56 Saudi Arabia needs to sell oil far more than America needs to buy Saudi oil. Riyadh has enormous expenses, meant of which can’t be kept withou oil money flowing in. The Kingdom can’t risk losing market share to other producers.

5944 2018-10-20 18:48:22 I think we might stop buying their oil for an hour maybe.

5947 2018-10-20 18:48:14 Bedelia seems to be of the psychodynamic school, indicated by her comment abt #Hannibal's choice of the world oil-spill for Will's madness, as oil being valuable as Will's madness is to Hannibal.

5952 2018-10-20 18:47:58 So don't complain about it then. This is what makes economic sense.

Oil companies care about what's most profitable not what is ethical or best for Canada.

5956 2018-10-20 18:46:55 I watched the documentary on bbc with all the celebrities that went to California and tried it. I’m sure one of them had chronic back pain and the oil helped so much more than what any painkillers did
5957 2018-10-20 18:46:45 Not as exiting as back in 2012: UPSS, service-farms, PS<>CD, .. even the demo gods let this hero down today .. end of a decade? End of oil&gas?

5959 2018-10-20 18:46:27 Smashed a bottle of olive oil on the kitchen floor 2 weeks ago. Wiped it, mopped it, mopped it twice again since. Still an utter fucking death trap. Cooking any meal is one massive adrenaline rush
5960 2018-10-20 18:46:27 my morning was an hour at the gym, oil change and 60k mile checkup, then the zoo with my family, and ended with lunch at Texas Roadhouse... I'd say it was good.
5961 2018-10-20 18:46:16 And makes us happy chefs at @theCOOKkitchen too!! Thank you Claire and Guy for the best Rapeseed oil in Kent
5962 2018-10-20 18:46:15 what they need is cheap power from renewables not dinosaur coal and oil plants. They have 5.6GW of gen cap vs peak demand of only 2.6GW and 1GW of renewables already. They should build 1GW of renewables and keep CC gas for the peaking. Then pursue the IT sector as a growth plan.
5963 2018-10-20 18:46:14 Of course not. It is High Politics , the oil and the weapon Industry  which 
' dominate' the game. Cash is King.

5975 2018-10-20 18:45:01 The worlds most scientifically illiterate, irrelevant website regarding climate change endorsed by an editor that works for an American hedge fund newspaper that promotes big oil and American gangsta style capitalism. Fake News indeed

5982 2018-10-20 18:44:11 my killer college tactic is buying frozen orange chicken and dumping the sauce packets, substituting it with a bunch of seasoned salt and other things, to just eat like fried chicken bits without needing a fryer/shittons of oil
5983 2018-10-20 18:44:10 JUST THINK, IF WE HAD PUT 1/10 OF THE MONEY WE SPENT ON MIDDLE EAST WARS INTO RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS, WE'D BE TOTALLY GREEN NOW AND COULD TELL THESE SAUDI THUGS TO DRINK THEIR DAMN OIL.  VOTE VLUE TO SAVE YOUR ASS !!!!

5985 2018-10-20 18:43:50 . @RealDocSoos Hey moron, with your faux outrage then using your logic we should not be buying oil from Saudia Arabia. Are you willing to pay $10 a gallon for gas? You liberals would be the first complain that Trump did that!
5986 2018-10-20 18:43:40 We don’t need their oil anymore. We don’t need them for anything. They may need us but we don’t need them.
5987 2018-10-20 18:43:38 This gave me goose bumps! A ‘one-of-us’ proclaiming truths, in the face of the roaring landslide that threatens to overcome us & defeat us!

5997 2018-10-20 18:42:15 What an irony it is that saudi shah gave execution orders of jamal khoshoggi and now give it the name of fist fight while saudi intelligence personals can be seen at spot. Trump bought this bullshit story because he doesnt want to lose his oil trade. What a pity.

6013 2018-10-20 18:40:36 Are you saying the US only intervened for oil prices? Did you not hear about operation Desert Storm, where we pushed back on Saddam's forces in Kuwait? Did you not hear how UN put sanctions on Iraq as a result of their actions? How is this about keeping oil prices low again?
6014 2018-10-20 18:40:36 Hi Kim Larsen. Your pizza with extra cheese and motor oil will be delivered in 34 min via tank.
6015 2018-10-20 18:40:34 As we ponder this horrific event, may we also remember Kim Jong Un, at this very moment, is keeping 100s of thousands of dissidents in gulags & feeding newborn babies to guard dogs and aborting fetuses by injecting motor oil into women's wombs. @realDonaldTrump supports this.

6036 2018-10-20 18:38:49 Lou, how many reports have you done on Russian Interference against our oil, coal and Gas Industry? We had better start beating the drum, if we want to continue producing more and more Coal and Oil and Natural Gas!
6037 2018-10-20 18:38:35 Oil change,air filter,possibly a carbon air filter,might be time for fuel injection service. But look in your owner's manual. It will show you what should be done.

6048 2018-10-20 18:37:39 Dale, just more con talk.  People hear what he wants them to hear and, like fools, believe. But, you have to keep exposing the con for what it is, snake oil.

6074 2018-10-20 18:35:12 Please know they can buy elsewhere. The US needs them to provide oil and a partner in the region. Those days will change as the POTUS has 6 more years to stop Iran, ISIS, AL Queida (?), NK. China cannot lose our trade and Russia cannot control the Middle East, which is Putin need
6075 2018-10-20 18:35:12 I think that the only way trump gets any blood to his little mushroom anymore is by standing in front of a crowd of cultists and lying to them. I think he will run again because as an impotent, incompotent, immoral snake oil salesmen it's how he gets his jollies.

6080 2018-10-20 18:34:41 It Does Not exist! Some of what’s in the pipeline is from the Obama Administration. We don’t need their oil either. Kushner and Trumps only need them to line their own pockets.
6081 2018-10-20 18:34:38 I think they come back in after earnings. I personally don't think they will be as dire as the market is projecting. Also believe after this seasonal weakness and refinery maintenance is over, the US will once again be hungry for Canadian oil. Line 3 also will help.
6082 2018-10-20 18:34:34 Fluids, brakes, oil change/filter, air filter.

6091 2018-10-20 18:33:31 VOTE DEM FOR MOTHER EARTH!

GOP for Vlad, MSB, big oil and cash because we’re ALL GONNA DIE ANYWAY
6092 2018-10-20 18:33:31 I use straight olive oil when I fry my breaded eggplants and chicken parmigiana. Again, healthier when baked but not as good. My kids refuse to eat the baked anymore even the little grand kids want fried.
6093 2018-10-20 18:33:16 If you're just using glue ons you can put oil on the nails let it sit for a few mins then use some kind of stick with a flat end to lift the edges. Quicker and better for ur nails then acetone and you can actually reuse the nails that way
6094 2018-10-20 18:32:56 Thanks mom  I don’t have tea tree oil but I have LOTS of tea
6095 2018-10-20 18:32:48 Oil will stat low for 2018, 2019
6096 2018-10-20 18:32:48 Ask them to check your oil, timing belt, your shocks and your alignment. You’re car is decently new so it should need that much work dont to it
6097 2018-10-20 18:32:35 Lorenzo‘s oil.
6098 2018-10-20 18:32:34 The first episode of Salt Fat Acid Heat has permanently warpedy standards for what he an appropriate amount of olive oil. Getting through three bottles a week these days.
6099 2018-10-20 18:32:33 Unless it's for farmers or oil companies or other big corporations right
6100 2018-10-20 18:32:23 lol what? how is anyone supposed to not use Saudi petroleum? Does your gas station have different pumps for each source of oil and for each refiner?
6101 2018-10-20 18:32:21 Who supports foreign oil? You're the one supporting an industry that imports oil. I support self sufficiency and refining here for our needs.
6102 2018-10-20 18:32:16 Perfect because in 50 years we’ll start selling potable water to you guys which will replace all the canadian oil you bought
6103 2018-10-20 18:32:09 If I was #TonyBlair I would have done the same deal with Bush. UK will back USA if Bush gives the UN route another go. Yes #Iraq was about oil, because Saddam offered France oil if they stopped the US the UN route could never work & now we live in a UN is irrelevant world.
6104 2018-10-20 18:32:07 It ended up being the fucken battery like everyone told me except him lol so he has to charge it all day. It’s caca but I got an oil change out of it so that’s good I guess. Now I can drive a lot to make money to make up for it
6105 2018-10-20 18:31:59 Keep using the hair masks but use argan oil or tea tree oil instead (coconut oil actually isn't that good for your hair) and LEAVE YOUR HAIR NATURAL, your hair will love you and become less frizzy over time, trust me
6106 2018-10-20 18:31:59 It was oil.
6107 2018-10-20 18:31:47 And PS I am pretty sure that truly legit Amish cookies would not have canola oil and likely not refined sugar and icing sugar.
6108 2018-10-20 18:31:38 They are getting away with everything. Funding terrorism, abducting Hariri, genocide in Yemen. Why wouldn’t they kill him? This time they made a mistake and they will be punished for it. Oil money won’t save you.
6109 2018-10-20 18:31:38 Just because we do, doesn't mean we have to continue down this bad road. We can assert our influence towards a change in leadership. Without the U.S . Keeping the shipping lanes open there is no Saudi oil
6110 2018-10-20 18:31:31 is it raining? is it snowing? should i get an oil change in this weather? am i getting drunk tonight? so many unanswered questions
6111 2018-10-20 18:31:27 Some tea tree oil and hot tea with ginger 
6112 2018-10-20 18:31:24 I’m concerned at how good peppermint oil makes my skin feel.
6113 2018-10-20 18:31:21 I beg to differ and if the UK fragments with some choosing to join the EU, the damage and difficulties will be all the more greater. For Scotland that oil cannot now be used given the Co2 issue and that was the major factor in believing Scotland could be solvent by itself.
6114 2018-10-20 18:31:05 It’s astonishing how much relief you feel when you are able to reset the oil life monitor from 0% to 100%. Also taught the boys the finer points of changing the oil, like, make sure the cardboard is properly aligned so as to not stain the driveway.
6115 2018-10-20 18:31:00 which explains why bush lied about multiple things in order to start a war with a country that closed off oil reserves to western oil companies, a situation that is no longer the case thanks to—once again—bush lying between his teeth about many things

6117 2018-10-20 18:30:57 Can someone come wash my hair then condition it, blow dry it and oil it....please 
6118 2018-10-20 18:30:47 Palm oil rice
6119 2018-10-20 18:30:33 I understand that @BarryGardiner has also proposed that the best way to hurt Saudi Arabia is to block imports to the UK of their oil and any derivative products that can be traced to Saudi production.
6120 2018-10-20 18:30:16 btw, if the Saudis cut off the oil they sell to the US or they jack up their prices, it WILL affect our economy here. we may not b as dependent upon them as we were n the late 1900s but they can still hurt us.
6121 2018-10-20 18:30:13 My future husband gone be shook..I took apart my car door to get inside of it & put it back together  like whatcha need pa, a back rub, dinner, oil change? You name it
6122 2018-10-20 18:30:12 literally anything!! If you Pinterest essential oil blends and you can choose one from there that you want, or you could search for sprays and I can make it!!

6124 2018-10-20 18:30:08 I prefer to use the "pills", where they've put the oil in little capsules. Consider those! (I'd link but I'm in Europe. Sorry~ <3)

6135 2018-10-20 18:28:48 Will @LindseyGrahamSC come out of his TrumpLove to condemn the Saudis and #Trump's fascination with the #Saudis and their oil and their investments in Trump properties?

6142 2018-10-20 18:27:50 Yep! That's why the extra $20  But no, just two onions. The rest was other stuff. Had to get some staples like olive oil, apple cider vinegar, soap, deodorant, foil, cling wrap, etc. It added up.

6144 2018-10-20 18:27:46 Maybe it’s time the Saudi’s join the modern world humans deserve rights basic rights. Princes, Royals , greed it’s like a movie set ..... and keep your fuckin oil too

6146 2018-10-20 18:27:17 Oil, buying condos n homophobia is too intoxicating a mix for Fauxtus & GOP gangsters to pass up for one life. Just ask not favorite son, Eric. It also plays well with Pat Robertson, Mike Pence, Tony Perkins & Jeff Sessions who never stand up against hate crimes to LGBTQ people!
6147 2018-10-20 18:27:14 @realDonaldTrump Trump .. no one believes the Saudi explanation .. it is neither credible or truthful yet because you like the oil and the aid with Iran your willing to brush a dead body and a brutal murder under the carpet ?? This will be your undoing unless you do something !!
6148 2018-10-20 18:27:05 Oil price stability.  If Saudi stops pumping oil, global oil prices will go to the roof.  Imagine what the effects on poor people of the world.   It would cost trillions of dollars.  For those of you who want the USA go to war, not a good idea right now.
6149 2018-10-20 18:27:02 Gutted I’ve been unable to see much theatre recently,so skint -tv licence,spotlight & equity all in one month will do that to ya!

6154 2018-10-20 18:26:37 Two things you will always have to do for your girl’s car as a boyfriend:

1. Keep her gas tank full. If you don’t, she will run out of gas. Women are allergic to gas stations. 

2. Get her oil changed. Women just refuse to do this unless you do it or take it to be done.
6155 2018-10-20 18:26:34 They spend A LOT of money on our weapons sales, oil may have something to do with it also...

6158 2018-10-20 18:26:25 Isn’t it so obvious that many talks .. it’s all to do with the 110 billion dollars deal that president Trump didn’t stop mentioning in every occasion again not to forget the oil deals which were signed
6159 2018-10-20 18:26:20 Rob McKenna represents Chevron Oil -- but his ads against a carbon fee don't disclose that ‘minor’ detail. Take these dishonest ads down @Kiro7Seattle @komonews @Q13Fox @KING5Seattle #waelex
6160 2018-10-20 18:26:17 Removing #FuelSubsidy at this time that Oil is currently hovering around $80/barrel may stoke national protests- my take.
6161 2018-10-20 18:26:15 The Southern part of Turkana County towards Lokichar has limited amount of aquifer which can be tapped for the oil delter region.The Biwot Electricity turb can add to the value chain #Power

6166 2018-10-20 18:25:53 Psalm 92: 10. But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.
6167 2018-10-20 18:25:35 Sure it was export pipeline but I’m sure refineries would surface around a stable source of oil.  We could compete.  If the environment is your concern not sure how supporting foreign oil helps.  I’ve seen production overseas...we are way better
6168 2018-10-20 18:25:33 Maybe it’s time the Saudi’s join the modern world where humans deserve rights basic rights and keep your fucking oil
6169 2018-10-20 18:25:26 Washington State has a carbon tax initiative on the ballot now. Big oil is throwing in a lot of money, 20 million, to bury it. I know you support helping our planet survive, maybe you could give this a nod on your show next week?
6170 2018-10-20 18:25:20 I not sure if this person thinks its a good or a bad thing but personally I think the statement is both true and horrifying

I dont believe being built on speculation or other issues will necessarily outweight greed and snake oil
6171 2018-10-20 18:25:05 So has every president since they found oil there
6172 2018-10-20 18:24:56 What does CBD oil do if I may ask?
6173 2018-10-20 18:24:55 No it is just like not mentioning the creation of fire or the wheel...

Also, just as with Standard Oil the antitrust legislation did not help or even identify an actual monopoly.

6176 2018-10-20 18:24:38 "FREE"   advice for your health ! Take Flax seed oil everyday because it   has more omega 3's than omega 6's.  Omega 3's  inhibit inflammation,    whereas omega 6's increase inflammation.  Fish and fish oils contain   more omega 3's but they may also contain mercury or radiation.
6177 2018-10-20 18:24:26 oh I dunno chitty......we shall see.
Nice position to be in though...decisions decisions
Nah ...buy some more Monday.
Final decision....YEP.....Like a monopoly board. Buy the lot xx.  .
6178 2018-10-20 18:24:24 Harper pushed back billions to get his balanced budget, (vets, SSC, Phoenix, etc), so on top of low oil prices it isn’t that surprising the deficit is higher. I lived through the Mulroney years, I can live through this.
6179 2018-10-20 18:24:22 ...just Bcos the oil in lamp is gradually drying up.
6180 2018-10-20 18:24:21 How can anyone like cod liver oil, that shii is an abomination, it in the same whatsapp group with Chlroquine
6181 2018-10-20 18:24:13 Check out the IUCN post. "Given other oil crops require up to nine times as much land to produce than palm oil, its replacement would significantly increase the total land area used for vegetable oil production to meet global demand."

6184 2018-10-20 18:23:53 Cries of "But... the oil! Gas prices will skyrocket!" are mostly BS.
Short-term likely will be chaos in commodities markets, but mainly bc Govs/States interfere heavily in supply & demand mechanisms.
The root problem is the coercion-based system - all Govs/States via Enforcers.
6185 2018-10-20 18:23:52 Actually, we have more oil than them, but getting it out of the ground requires the evil “fracking”...

After 5 years cementing wells for Halliburton, I’m still wondering how 600’ deep water is affected by 1 mile deep fracturing.
6186 2018-10-20 18:23:49 boiling cleaning products to make your house smell good when they have oil diffusers, plug ins, incense, wax warmers, and Febreze is the reason y some of y’all slow now.
6187 2018-10-20 18:23:48 Indeed. The UK industry is dependent on Saudi trade/arms/oil. Brave politics to stand up to them.
6188 2018-10-20 18:23:46 Today I’m using my mailed Colorado ballot to sit down with my girls and show them how to vote straight Democrat for each person on it. I’ll also show them how to vote against big oil and fracking, and why. #copolitics #ColoradoVotes #EarlyVoting
6189 2018-10-20 18:23:43 Pro tip: vegetable oil works well to get gum out of hair
6190 2018-10-20 18:23:34 With the Canadian oil discount, it's probably hurting it. More exposure to Canadian prices and the awful differential. Will know when they report earnings.
6191 2018-10-20 18:23:21 I know my history, I am against American imperialism, and I believe capitalism must be regulated strictly. SA is a whole different case, and Wahhabism is as wrong as our evangelicals. If the world were mine I would reduce oil consumption, and try to fix the climate.
6192 2018-10-20 18:23:19 If it wasn't for the Americans for finding oil under Saudi's feet , it would have been a dirt poor country. Americans  operated the oil fields at first , but over time they trained the Saudis, who eventually took over the oil fields.  US has a stake. Saudis r US and US r Saudis
6193 2018-10-20 18:23:15 Why didn’t my free oil change from amarillo honda transfer with me 
6194 2018-10-20 18:23:07 Instead, Trump fighting to make us more reliant on foreign oil, repealing mileage standards on auto makers. Who benefits in the end.....now you've got a gas guzzler, gas prices, will result in even HIGHER prices for goods (they've already inc under Trump) CLASS DIVIDE WIDENS
6195 2018-10-20 18:22:23 It's because his tullow oil contract was not renewed. But he had made enough money within the first contract
6196 2018-10-20 18:22:20 @emptywheel explain to @BarrettBrown_  that
Russia is so savvy they have U.S pretend to be aggressive
supplying Ukraine"rebels"with weapons,warships in black sea,decry oil deals with Germany,expel diplomats,nix Iran deal,blame"novichok"poisoning, appoint anti Russia neo cons etc
6197 2018-10-20 18:22:18 Lol omg, "Add oil" got added to the Oxford Dictionary. What the actual fuck.

6199 2018-10-20 18:21:57 ...FL will become CA if corrupt Gillum is elected. Vote DeSantis as Governor of FL to save it from Gillum’s 40% tax increase & $10 a barrel tax increase on oil.   Vote Republican to save FL!

6203 2018-10-20 18:21:32 Collapse in oil prices after Harper created dependence on oil prices. Then global trade war with Trump threatening to lock Canada out of the US market.
6204 2018-10-20 18:21:30 oh boring but then at least u can use the oil to make ur own healthier edible
6205 2018-10-20 18:21:29 That lavender+lemongrass & lavender+rosemary essential oil blends 
6206 2018-10-20 18:21:15 Oil, money, strategically located land for US bases, mutual distrust of Iran.
6207 2018-10-20 18:20:48 Also get some scales and weigh out your food so you’re aware of portion sizes etc. And switch to the spray oil stuff/put oil in a spray bottle so you use less
6208 2018-10-20 18:20:35 Does that mean, the oil is not just harmless (what I personally think)?
6209 2018-10-20 18:20:25 Well to be honest, only just last week I finally completed my tot up for HMRC.  I am thinking of putting a bit more cash under the mattress!  I have to have a rethink.  Didn't do too badly last year but my guts are telling me to buy another freezer a lot of wine and some spam.
6210 2018-10-20 18:20:22 The Saudi Arabian King and his son, ly in the face of their own God, their own people and in the face of the entire world. Their crimes of murder will forever be a part of the Saudi kingdom and their evil intentions. MBS is a terrorist with money and oil.
6211 2018-10-20 18:20:20 Those markets don't want the oil. The refineries can't handle the heavy oil and they have cheaper options. 
Energy East was an export pipeline.
6212 2018-10-20 18:20:17 You ever heard of a castor oil pack?
6213 2018-10-20 18:20:13 I wonder how the Chinese are feeling!
6214 2018-10-20 18:20:03 No, not "Each gigawatt of solar/wind needs to to be backed up by a gigawatt from coal/oil/gas/fracking" 

rather 

Each gigawatt of solar/wind needs to to be backed up by FOUR gigawatts from coal/oil/gas/fracking.
6215 2018-10-20 18:19:54 I get so stuck about everything happening in the US, especially with elections around the corner. But terrible things are happening everywhere. Did you know that oil companies are trying to steal the land of the various indigenous tribes of the Ceibo Alliance in the Amazon?
6216 2018-10-20 18:19:39 This First Nation refineries in not yet built.  It’s proposed.  I hope it goes ahead.  So is your main opposition to pipelines the market or support for Saudi oil?
6217 2018-10-20 18:19:33 Oh it’s not just the U.K.- it’s all of us! We are all dependent on their oil and need their $$ for trade deals.

6219 2018-10-20 18:19:09 Again just because the snake oil salesmen told you at his pep rally that is true. Doesn’t make it so. I really think you should take a look at the economy when Obama took over and what Trump took over. It’s a lot harder to turn it around then to keep it going. See FDR vs JFKs eco

6221 2018-10-20 18:18:54 Theres been plenty of opportunities to make money here. Long term investing isnt one of them ! They've successfully turned  #MXO into a POS lifestyle company. It had so much going in the early days as well.
6222 2018-10-20 18:18:45 Not at all.  The reason we can’t get oil to the east isn’t the market it’s the regulations infringing on pipelines.  If the market decided those pipelines would have been built a long time ago.
6223 2018-10-20 18:18:27 High horse. Let’s see how Saudi survives 100 percent sanctions. We can get our 18 percent of your oil you provide us elsewhere. No oil in the country and the house of Saud goes back to the bedouin days.
6224 2018-10-20 18:18:20 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump and @LindseyGrahamSC and @AdamSchiff should watch @erelija’s @FoxNews interview concerning #KhashoggiMurder. As tragic as this has been, the US must maintain a relationship with #KSA, for #Iran, oil, counterterrorism, and peace in the region.

6229 2018-10-20 18:17:47 Those who would give up essential German ale, to purchase a little temporary Media Production, deserve neither Avocado nor Mustard oil.
6230 2018-10-20 18:17:40 @realDonaldTrump @CNN the murder of a US journalist in Saudi Arabia is disturbing. It’s not that the Saudi’s are good alies, it’s all about the oil and oil is trumping human rights. As leader of the free world you need to hold these bastards accountable
6231 2018-10-20 18:17:39 A country riven with corruption & crime cartels, under US sanctions. A leader attempted to use oil wealth for the people, the establishment & the US lost their shit & ensured it failed. Compare like with like. Norway would be ideal, a Northern European country with N sea assets.

6235 2018-10-20 18:17:23 Now would seem like a good time to applaud efforts to decrease US oil dependency on countries like Saudi Arabia which as of end 2017 provided a 30 year low of less than 9% of US oil imports

6237 2018-10-20 18:16:53 I do. I saw how the GOPeePees wanted to install oil pipelines through the sacred burial grounds in North Dakota. And the Native Americans were peacefully protesting while those sheriffs are trying to engage in violence against them. If you think this isn't wrong, you're sick!

6241 2018-10-20 18:16:49 US does not need Saudi A. as a strategic ally or for oil. US should read SA the riot act. Cut off arms sales. And give them the same cold shoulder we gave Cuba for 50 years.
fyi... Cuba cold shoulder was unjustified and stupid after the Russian missiles were gone.

6245 2018-10-20 18:16:31 $20 for a small bottle at most drug stores. I'm a clutz in the kitchen and always have some. I actually grabbed a hot oven burner with two fingers last week!! Has to be the essential oil, not fragrance oil.

6254 2018-10-20 18:15:40 Was out of both sunflower & canola oil so substituted extra virgin olive oil to Mom’s zucchini bread recipe. HOLY FORKING SHIRTBALLS! Olive oil+pandan substitutions to her original recipe are amazing! The taste is even more rich and the bread texture is out of this world. 
6255 2018-10-20 18:15:29 Me!! I make essential oil rollers with gemstones and dried flowers!
6256 2018-10-20 18:15:27 That tweet about not getting oil changes is about me.
6257 2018-10-20 18:15:24 The kingdom of heaven runs on good intentions.  Those on earth run on oil. Hence our love affair with the House of Saud.

6262 2018-10-20 18:14:47 NBC SKY CNN the networks I choose to watch hence I sealed case w/ NBC ABC & FOX, these networks clearly are inline w/ Saudi Arabia pushing PROPAGANDA. The propaganda today ( it morphs daily ) is “ Arms deal, money, oil, ‘Middle East peace’ over ride any and all human rights” 
6263 2018-10-20 18:14:46 Dont be ignorant, natural gas prices (and consequently lpg) are closely tied to oil prices. Albeit with some lag, if oil price rises, gas prices eventually follow suit.
6264 2018-10-20 18:14:31 Where the Venezuelan government went wrong is that they didn't do enough to reduce the dependence of their economy on oil exports.
6265 2018-10-20 18:14:25 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
6266 2018-10-20 18:14:18 As a voter in Ky3 I do not expect my government to crash the oil market and allow Iran to run Amok. Going by your premise Hillary is personally responsible for Benghazi, Bernie sanders is responsible for Scalise shooting.
6267 2018-10-20 18:14:15 You mean like the liberals not caring about tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in lost revenue for oil and gas?  Give your head a shake.  Not to mention, as soon as it was legalized the medical users like myself got fucked over.

6269 2018-10-20 18:14:06 Its not 1973 Carl, America can do without the gasoline and oil provided by Saudi Arabia, The USA imports only 9% of its oil and gas, what the USA loses from Saudi Arabia could easily be made up from Canada or the US could build wind and solar projects and never need the Saudis.

It's scary!!
6271 2018-10-20 18:13:35 Trump's plan for Iran is to make your country poor, and then he will take your oil to give to Israel. It will put money in Trump's pocket. That is what he wants.
6272 2018-10-20 18:13:34 With Donald Trump, it's money. Previous Democratic or Republican presidents, I would believe oil/Mid-East ally, but not this time. The proof isn't opinion, he brags of it. He considers his interests only, not the US interests. Vote him out. Vote Republican again when they earn it
6273 2018-10-20 18:13:22 And Forgot To get more now Maybe the span of a joke which completely encapsulates an oil change for the spectacle even if
6274 2018-10-20 18:13:12 Oil now at  $69.37/bbl  up $0.72 since yesterday.
A rift between US n Saudis could wreck havoc on the US economy.
That's one thing the Deep State/Dems are hoping for b4 the elections.
And IF that doesn't work, a war would be a nice 2nd option. - for them
6275 2018-10-20 18:13:07 Use a mixture of olive oil and canola oil to fry meatballs. Olive oil's low burn temperature doesn't allow for best cooking using canola raises burn point.

6278 2018-10-20 18:12:41 Venezuela's economy went into freefall when Saudi Arabia flooded the market with cheap oil as part of an economic war against their competitors. The Venezuelan economy depended on oil exports & the drop in prices undermined their economy.

6285 2018-10-20 18:12:07 So clearly you know Saudi oil being imported by private enterprise is the free market at work and has nothing to with Singh or export pipelines.

How dare they murder that reporter right in our face & then piss on us and tell us it's raining?  I am DONE with the Saudis and I don't care how much money or oil they have.  Put em on the ban list.
6288 2018-10-20 18:11:44 i.e., Fund flows.  Don't worry IF JT gets the boot money will return to the sector.  We need money to build trends.  IF the government changes US money will come back into the sector.  Otherwise your long term oil holding are dead money.

6329 2018-10-20 18:08:34 work extensively w refineries.  Distribution is local, needs market of sufficient size.  If Alberta refined oil and shipped to BC/East would there still be objections to pipelines?  There are several products in unrefined oil.  I support more refineries if  market supports.
6330 2018-10-20 18:08:33 I love buying gallons of vegetable oil and generic metamucil in orange flavor, 2 of the quart jars at the same time. Always gets me a side eye. BTW, oil is a cheap form of fat and the metamucil gets rid of sand in the gut for... horses!

6349 2018-10-20 18:05:57 Iran. America likes to have allies who can be counterweight to those they consider are our enemies.  The Saudis also have a lot of money and a lot of oil. Our economy is still much too fossil fuel dependent which is bad for economic security and bad for climate change.
6350 2018-10-20 18:05:46 Bought some more maracuja oil to moisturize my skin during winter 
6351 2018-10-20 18:05:43 Did you know?  Pennsylvania is one of the top three producers of electricity in the nation. To PA voters if electrical energy is a No.3 producer in the country, that means coal is out.  Trump lied, people, are not heating their homes with coal they use electricity solar or oil.
6352 2018-10-20 18:05:34 Same, tto jugak tp bila pakai sbm toner mcm ok pulak  sbb selalu pakai utk spot treatment je. 
Another one is rosehip seed oil, naik bnyak tiny bumps after one day application so terus bg that oil to my sis
6353 2018-10-20 18:05:25 I kind of like taking my car in for inspections/oil changes. Not only do I feel so very, very grown up after, but it forces me to just sit down and take a little quiet me time. I am going to read and dang book.
6354 2018-10-20 18:05:24 If Britain pisses off the Saudis, who will buy our weapons? How will we continue to arm the middle east? We can't let the Americans have a monopoly on it. 
All that money we give them for oil has to come back somehow.
6355 2018-10-20 18:05:19 hey you know it’s NBD i just got oil and vinegar all over my pants

6359 2018-10-20 18:05:00 Okay, if you do use pure CBD oil and it helps you, could you guys please link me where you order it from? My friend Amy sent me a website, but I'd like to look at others too. <3 I really need something else for my chronic pain. It's unbearable sometimes.
6360 2018-10-20 18:04:57 Unless I'm mistaken, Blue Apron does not in fact include all ingredients in the box. The instructions for the Quesadillas make multiple references to Olive Oil, which I have not found in the box and do not own.

6362 2018-10-20 18:04:48 Facewash, sunscreen, moisturizer, milk cleanser, toner, exfoliator, micellar water / face oil (optional).
6363 2018-10-20 18:04:42 No. The USA is complicit. BLOOD for oil. BLOOD for deals. It’s profit & gains vs. lives & values.
6364 2018-10-20 18:04:35 Now waiting while the car gets an oil change and planning what I’ll do@with my 1.6 billion lottery winnings.
6365 2018-10-20 18:04:31 Not exactly. Us Real Christians™ are nothing like the lying grifter evangelicals. Especially the "televangelists".

God created everything from NOTHING in 6 days, right? He knows how to make gold, silver, diamonds, oil, etc.

Q: Why does He need money?
A: *He* doesn't.

6371 2018-10-20 18:03:43 Have you seen the attitudes that the likes of F Coppola and John R? hold, and the toxic responses they have to women who are just seeking recognition of their situation Paul? If you scratch the surface you may see why they're oil and water, check them out. And why do they do it?
6372 2018-10-20 18:03:07 Our issue is that our media gives massive time to useless politicians, and snake oil salesmen.
6373 2018-10-20 18:02:59 FDR started it then in 1971 Pres. Nixon dropped $ convertibility to Gold. Kissinger then negotiated w/ Saudis to price oil in $ for U.S. military protection. Guaranteeing $ as world's currency. Saudis have this POWERFUL leverage. U.S. will do NOTHING! END The FED! Use GOLD again
6374 2018-10-20 18:02:58 An example: oil is supposedly running out because of the commonly accepted (but not proven) hypothesis that petroleum comes from dead dinosaurs in the earth decomposing over many eons; however there are other theories explaining how it is possibly fermented in Earths mantle[1/2]
6375 2018-10-20 18:02:58 if you dropped me off in the wilderness, as long as you gave me a jar of coconut oil, I’d be good.
6376 2018-10-20 18:02:57 Venezuela was a democratically elected socialist government. It was lauded as the ultimate achievement by the left... well guess what today they are eating dogs in the street and a basic foods like rice, oil and flour take like whole day to find if you can even find/afford it.
6377 2018-10-20 18:02:49 And buying their damned oil.
6378 2018-10-20 18:02:48 Without proof....clearly you don't read and watch anything apart from state sponsored propaganda that covers up all the crimes of your royal family....and don't worry they will be held accountable oil will soon run out and then the truth will become clear
6379 2018-10-20 18:02:41 @RadissonBLUDubA  T3 is a lovely area to chill out and have a drink but the current aroma of frying oil is not great...nice to know that fresh oil is in the fryers but don't need to smell it.... :)
6380 2018-10-20 18:02:32 Wait kaye, she's applying baby oil to her dm so i can slide in.
6381 2018-10-20 18:02:29 I’ve tried it with and without the oil and it’s so stressful. You might like it but it’s just too much of a risk and it’s not cheap

6384 2018-10-20 18:02:03 And why do we do ANY business with the Saudis? 15 of the 19 attackers on 911 were from Saudi Arabia. We don’t need their oil. We don’t need their money.

6386 2018-10-20 18:01:54 (the funding is Saudi oil money)
6387 2018-10-20 18:01:48 The fact of the matter is that oil companies conduct more scientific research on All fish populations in the Arctic than all other entities combined, and provide that information to Alaska Department of Natural Resources and to Alaska Department of Fish & Game.
6388 2018-10-20 18:01:41 i guess the consolation is that at least with the oil, you’ll burn quicker

6393 2018-10-20 18:01:01 15 of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 were Saudis.  They behead people. They torture people. They already killed the guy who flew him to Turkey. WTF. We don’t need their money or their oil
6394 2018-10-20 18:00:59 Wow.  Great place to live too!  My family had a blast a few years back when the kids were little at the Revelstoke KOA.          That’s a long drive for an oil change. Thanks for the loyalty to @JiffyOnSparrow.
6395 2018-10-20 18:00:56 Saudi Arabia set crude oil prices.. America is buying for 64 dollars a barrel ... plus 110, billions in weapons trade employing 600,thousands Americans.. so problems with Saudi Arabia will hurt USA... Iran May have had it done.. to effectively destroy America jobs and gas prices
6396 2018-10-20 18:00:53 Jamal, reporter working for WP, Muslim, exile, immigrant, critic of Jemen war.

Has Trump demonized WP and reporters as enemies?

Putin and Iran want to damage Saudis, to get more money and power from oil exports. Turkey gets their energy from Russia and Iran. Trump has his deals

6401 2018-10-20 18:00:20 @realDonaldTrump No country has the right to buy oil from Iran, if we get exempted, our response will be very heavy. Fourth of November is the end of Iran's oil and the start of regime change in Iran
6402 2018-10-20 18:00:15 Not really a "sauce" but I LOVE Mongolian Fire Oil by House of Tsang. Sesame and cottonseed oil infused with Garlic, chilies, ginger and onion. INCREDIBLE.

The crude oil reserves are the same they were 100 yrs ago. Iron to make steel, aluminum, too many natural resources to list on a tweet.

Bad politicians like the Dems is what made it what it is today

6409 2018-10-20 17:59:56 @realDonaldTrump The two countries and Europe will have a few weeks, if on November 4, oil from Iran They will pay a heavy price, they can stop all transactions with them and set terrible tariffs against them, this is a very serious alert.
6410 2018-10-20 17:59:51 I got oil on my scrubs and now I feel shame 
6411 2018-10-20 17:59:48 aaaa this whole week was such a bad start. need more lavender oil
6412 2018-10-20 17:59:48 They changed them....  in fairness Alex remember the time you decided to cook me a nut free lasagne? With nut oil?
6413 2018-10-20 17:59:35 I expect governments would find it a lot easier to stand up to the Saudis if they didn't control so much of the world's oil production. 
6414 2018-10-20 17:59:33 Omg now I know why my red faded so fast the last time, my shampoo was coconut oil based! I've learned something today

6418 2018-10-20 17:58:43 Uhh, double top oil??
6419 2018-10-20 17:58:42 It is impossible, Crown Prince has all the controls in Saudi Arabia. No body is going to tell a leader of a country which has oil, money to resign? Practically signing his own death warrant.
6420 2018-10-20 17:58:34 Lol I was gonna say tar but motor oil just seemed more nastier 
6421 2018-10-20 17:58:29 Can we afford not to buy their oil?
6422 2018-10-20 17:58:25 @realDonaldTrump In all these games, we won and showed that the oppressors will never win. The games showed how important the boycott of oil is, and Iran's oil exports should be completely cut off by November 4th, China and India should never be exempted
6423 2018-10-20 17:58:19 Wishful thinking. POTUS needs their money for his pocketbook and their oil since he sanctioned Iran. His tax cut and tariffs are causing rising inflation and deficit. He can't afford fuel prices to go up too. Scared his base might catch on he is a fake, know-nothing president.

6425 2018-10-20 17:58:13 I've been wanting it for months. Wake and bake oil?
6426 2018-10-20 17:58:12 If it’s got oils in it, probably. Oil breaks down the dye. Learned that the hard way when I did a coconut oil mask on fresh vivid hair. 
6427 2018-10-20 17:58:02 You forgot the part about controlling the world’s price on oil.
6428 2018-10-20 17:57:56 I asked this man how long my oil change is going to take I laughed and said “shut up” and he said 2 lmaoooo im bouta get scammed

6436 2018-10-20 17:57:08 @realDonaldTrump See what the Iranian regime is doing, because the Iranian regime's criminality pours billions of dollars in oil money into the account of the Jews and the British, and does not want to end this wealth
6437 2018-10-20 17:57:04 Um....OIL?
6438 2018-10-20 17:57:03 I like that synthetic lanes can hold the oil longer.. but hate the sticky ass approach when taking your shot.. #bowling #fml
6439 2018-10-20 17:56:59 If the American government is willing to state that they have no problem with other governments committing murder then that's fine but didn't they use the excuse that Saddam was murdering his people so they could invade Iraq for oil? America is no better than Saudi Arabia.
6440 2018-10-20 17:56:57 What can we do? Many administrators before you got us into this mess...we depend on them heavily for oil and for them to buy our weapons ..if they dont buy from us they will get their weapons from someone else and we will probably lose our edge in the region
6441 2018-10-20 17:56:53 And I said that even if it were only 10,000, it doesn't appear horrendous to you? Can you tell me why any ONE person should die at all? So, 50 million people can die for oil and gas, and it cannot be a genocide because they "didn't kill us off"? Are you praying it for your own?
6442 2018-10-20 17:56:50 Follow the $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ & the Oil (= $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$)
6443 2018-10-20 17:56:37 @realDonaldTrump It was a difficult month for a month to do everything to stop the Iranian oil sanctions, Iran's killing, rocket propaganda, the United Nations captive missile, and Saudi criticism.
6444 2018-10-20 17:56:35 #Kashoggi killing is a savegery of extra idiot minds!!! #saudiarabia You dont belong to this century! Go to HELL and burn your stupid minds in your valuable oil
6445 2018-10-20 17:56:26 And oil wasn't even ISIS' leading source of funding. Most of their money came from robbing people at gunpoint in regions they controlled...er..."taxing" them.
6446 2018-10-20 17:56:16 Oil cutoff.
6447 2018-10-20 17:56:09 I wonder if we have enough oil? Is alternative energy more important? That is why we are always doing things that are not important and ignoring the most important things.
6448 2018-10-20 17:56:06 why do they always try to sell me smth else when i go to get my oil changed it makes me so anxious
6449 2018-10-20 17:55:42 My thought exactly when I saw his reply, where is the red oil sir?

6452 2018-10-20 17:55:24 IMHO, those bombs have been paid by saudi oil, not taxes. Then, the lack of ethics in our economical system has made our companies sold them those bombs, planes, tanks... Not a problem of taxes, a problem of ethics. With ethics, probably we didn't need taxes.
6453 2018-10-20 17:55:18 coffee scrubs are the freakin best, and not store bought ones. literally coffee grinds and coconut oil. my skin feels so good

6467 2018-10-20 17:54:25 The Int. Community must reject da House of Saud 's cock & bull story abt da sordid #JamalKhashoggi affair. Oil money can't make this outrage go away.  @realDonaldTrump @JustinTrudeau @EmmanuelMacron @UN @CyrilRamaphosa @UKenyatta @GermanAmbGhana @MBuhari @JDMahama @NAkufoAddo
6468 2018-10-20 17:54:25 Exactly. We gave them a pass on 9/11, in Yemen, just as we are with Khashoggi, because our leaders worship at the altar of money and oil. The GOP, “Immorality, Inc” are morally bankrupt and have no empathy for real human beings, just lust for power and inhumane policy positions.
6469 2018-10-20 17:54:18 Perhaps you can lay out exactly what is the strategic value of backing the Saudis, when America is a net oil exporter.
6470 2018-10-20 17:54:05 We need to have a serious discussion about seizing assets of oil execs who lied/concealed climate data, systematically, for years. Their insane profits-earned largely through fraud & illegal behavior-should go towards innovators committed to trying and solving the climate crisis.
6471 2018-10-20 17:54:04 At @bioneers just now @J_WintersLDF was interrupted for saying CA’s #SB100 bill will phase out #fossilfuels by 2045. Why? The truth is @JerryBrownGov is still permitting new oil + gas wells (20000+ in past 7yrs) with no plans to stop #BrownsLastChance #Bioneers2018
6472 2018-10-20 17:53:56 Twitter universe, don’t fall for this spin doctor’s snake oil.  “Increasing transparency around medicine costs” by NOT showing the actual f***ing cost because we might become confused? Wtf
6473 2018-10-20 17:53:50 #ukog already have one painful lesson under their belt. They know that Broadford Bridge sidetrack did not flow this year. Despite all the hype and oil pouring promotion clips on You Tube, it was 100% uncommercial. They certainly need to use a different technique, as you say!
6474 2018-10-20 17:53:41 Yes,  everyone moving to TX works for oil and gas...
6475 2018-10-20 17:53:34 He got it from where he needed it. Fucking shitty little oil club should think themselves lucky they won the lottery and have some of Europe’s top coaches passing through
6476 2018-10-20 17:53:33 We’re not dependent on them at all for oil. US defense contractors are dependent on them for millions of $ of business, and the rump Crime Family is dependent on them for private biz revenues. That’s why they’re being coddled!
6477 2018-10-20 17:53:30 Oil. Oil. Oil. For a century.
6478 2018-10-20 17:53:24 The absolutele galaxy brain of the people saying Saudi oil doesn't matter. How you people manage to survive through the day without tripping over your shoelaces and falling under a bus is a genuine conundrum.

6480 2018-10-20 17:53:20 Well that’s what happens when you forget to change your oil.
6481 2018-10-20 17:53:18 Oil, loans, regional support.

Admittedly it's across party lines and I can see why it's so hard to cut ties. But Trump is straight up rolling over for them. At least others, even Republicans, pretended to be independent
6482 2018-10-20 17:53:16 Oil & military base access
6483 2018-10-20 17:53:16 The price of oil. #Khashoggi
6484 2018-10-20 17:53:14 Electric showers struggle if you're on a low pressure/flow cold water supply (common problem when you're off mains) or when the incoming pipe isn't buried deep enough (shower can't warm the water fast enough). Got a back boiler on an oil stove here and it does lovely baths!
6485 2018-10-20 17:53:05 Sprinkle baking soda in all the drawers and leave it over night then use vinegar (add orange or other essential oil so it’s not vinegar smelling) the next day to clean it out.
6486 2018-10-20 17:52:34 One hardly ever hears the word 'greb' or 'grebo' anymore to describe someone with long, greasy hair who smells of leather, denim, patchouli oil and disappointment.
6487 2018-10-20 17:52:30 Johnson’s Oil Gel >>>> lotion
6488 2018-10-20 17:52:23 I’m choosing to stay at home and watch Barca play over going out to lick oil at my friend’s birthday. Don’t let me regret this decision.
6489 2018-10-20 17:52:22 Oil. Seriously!
6490 2018-10-20 17:52:17 *pull up to get my oil changed*
“What can we get started for ya today?” 

6491 2018-10-20 17:52:16 Umm. The place I’m getting my oil changed. Has Misery on the tv playing.........
6492 2018-10-20 17:52:15 I actually use CBD oil myself! It really helps my headaches, my bicarpal tunnel , stomaches, etc. There are lots of benefits to it and although it is a little pricey it is definitely worth it in my opinion. Just a few drops under the tongue a day to help keep the pain at bay 
6493 2018-10-20 17:52:03 Coloquemos as coisas no lugar: a Exxon Mobil = Esso = Standad Oil sempre interferiu no Estado, apoiou o Golpe, atuou para inviabilizar a Petrobras, atuou para definir a ‘Opinião’ pública etc faz mais de 100 anos.
6494 2018-10-20 17:52:03 OIL.
6495 2018-10-20 17:51:56 Oil rents is sweet to collect ...in real incentive to do much else
6496 2018-10-20 17:51:54 This fucking @FirestoneTires is so worthless. Three hours to do an oil change? A confirmed appointment without the parts to do the work? Unbelievable. Never again.
6497 2018-10-20 17:51:40 Used to be oil. Now it's straight up bribery.
6498 2018-10-20 17:51:31 And you think Scotland would rely on  oil for our survival as a self governing country? Contrary to your obvious misconceptions, we would do very well without the reliance of oil. What we don’t need is HS2, maintaining London’s sewers, renovating Buckingham Palace, Trident,....

6501 2018-10-20 17:51:19 Lets dive deeper into this.  My state has a vote coming up to further push gas and coal industries out.  They are having a big campaign to stop this proposition.  "Losing thousands of jobs, not only in the gas and oil fields, but the jobs that profit from them too."
6502 2018-10-20 17:51:09 “....As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy,
we oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies.”
6503 2018-10-20 17:51:05 @SecPompeo
@realDonaldTrump
@POTUS 
Gentlemen;
I’m still hopeful that both of you, along with Congress are willing to properly punish MBS for this atrocity.  I realize that military equipment deals, Oil, The Middle East are all important items but KBS has to go.
6504 2018-10-20 17:51:01 It’s called oil and military bases to contain Iran.
6505 2018-10-20 17:51:00 I accidentally stopped for gas in New Jersey recently. The employee lurking around the gas pumps seemed as uncomfortable as I was. So creepy.

He didn't even offer to clean my windshield or check my oil.
6506 2018-10-20 17:50:57 The concept seems fair for finite resources like oil, just the data and methodology is off.

Also the faster a finite resource is extracted, the faster the fall when that peak is reached.

Basically the total supply is unknown.
6507 2018-10-20 17:50:55 Name something you would not want to wake up next to.

6508 2018-10-20 17:50:54 Well in the 80s we wer 10 to 15 years away from no oil and the northern states would be covered in glaciers. In the 90s we had only 20 yrs of oil left and the Midwest was 10 years away from being the new sahara desert. Gore gave us around 10 yrs aboit 10 yrs ago. Seing a pattern?
6509 2018-10-20 17:50:52 It used to be oil.
6510 2018-10-20 17:50:45 The US is the top oil producer reliant on high levels of debt to fund shale ventures. High oil prices are needed to keep this ponzi scheme intact.
6511 2018-10-20 17:50:42 Oil, you silly goose.
6512 2018-10-20 17:50:37 The Shining on Netflix. I don't know why Jack is making me laugh as he tries to get the bat from Olive Oil.
6513 2018-10-20 17:50:30 No @ms_mumtaza was a so wonderful and sent me Angelica root oil (smells of pepper) and I used coconut oil as a carrier and it helps so much
But pepper and coconut does sound good for shrimp
6514 2018-10-20 17:50:29 Saudi Aramco going public has been pushed back several times... Why? They’d have to give a full reserve audit, which will likely crash the price of oil.
6515 2018-10-20 17:50:22 Oil . . .

6517 2018-10-20 17:50:13 Having wife's car serviced today - oil, inspection. Found to need front brake pads, antifreeze/brake fluid change, filters.  
I'm a nerd, yes?

6518 2018-10-20 17:50:06 Lets be clear on one thing ryt. The only thing you are unlocking is inflation, spaghetti queues of fuel,oil & a whole lotta bull.

6521 2018-10-20 17:49:50 I don’t need to hear the tapes or anything else. I am now a Saudi foreign relations expert. America must immediately go to war with Saudi Arabia and drive up the price of oil, sending the world into a global energy crisis. You’re welcome.
6522 2018-10-20 17:49:48 Anyone ever try CBD oil? Thoughts? Friend and doctor both recommended it. Even my vet recommended it for Lucy. Maybe I should get some...
6523 2018-10-20 17:49:46 Oil and gas profit margins are 2-5%. Most of the cost of gas and oil is taxes. Taxes amount to much more than the cost of production. Oil companies are funding your government run, anti-freedom utopia.
6524 2018-10-20 17:49:43 If #Cryptocurrency is Gasoline, then #Blockchain is Oil
6525 2018-10-20 17:49:43 Oil... it’s called oil
6526 2018-10-20 17:49:41 1) what was the volume of these spills and 2) what types of spills are these (water, oil, chemicals, etc)
6527 2018-10-20 17:49:38 Mineral oil. 
6528 2018-10-20 17:49:33 What? Huh? Oil? Who said something bout oil bitch you cooking?
6529 2018-10-20 17:49:30 Why am I so anxious just about taking my car to get the oil changed
6530 2018-10-20 17:49:22 Since when is oil prices a measure of growth...our growth is currently performing above forecast. That is a fact, not whatever it is you are spewing here.
6531 2018-10-20 17:49:17 Truth be told is I probably added too much of the oil and it made the scent overwhelming.  Good to know for next time!  Its one of the least ordered soaps,  so I rarely get feedback on it.

6534 2018-10-20 17:48:40 I smell good asf y’all! @NIVEAUSA has this vanilla and almond oil scented lotion, and makes your skin feel so soft and it smells amazing!
6535 2018-10-20 17:48:36 Nigeria would have gained from it, he wouldnt have allocate oil wells to himself like ur pdp ppl did.
6536 2018-10-20 17:48:32 At least it is not an operated brain  like that of your type of “good politicians”

See you in Brazil soon for a punya punya cooking oil
6537 2018-10-20 17:48:30 Good point. Both smaller, skilled players too. If Yamamoto can become a regular 25-goal scorer like Eberle, then the Oil made a great another pick at 22nd overall.
6538 2018-10-20 17:48:29 I'm old, I have in my lifetime had "friends" who were not. Saudi Arabia is not a friend or ally. We don't don't need their oil or their money. We have nothing to lose by breaking ties with these rich murdering tyrants. Americans need to get out now.
6539 2018-10-20 17:48:29 There are thousands of different ways to trade, which resource are using today ? U trading car, car parts, food, drugs/plants, gold, oil. It’s a big world out there.
6540 2018-10-20 17:48:19 Oatmeal and motor oil 
6541 2018-10-20 17:48:01 まぜこみわーかめ
6542 2018-10-20 17:48:01 Yeah! To think the only thing that's needed is hundreds of millions of dirty oil money. It's amazing!
6543 2018-10-20 17:47:28 penne arabia foundation, emphasis on garlic, tomatoes, and dried red chili peppers cooked in olive oil
6544 2018-10-20 17:47:26 Nothing new, every administration has turned a blind eye to the Saudis murderous activities...oil, money, a partner in crime equals  the blood of the innocent, you do the math.
6545 2018-10-20 17:47:24 kkkkk waiona here..heard kuti u shud buy zapnacks first then kkkkk oil....wonders never end
6546 2018-10-20 17:47:24 Need that oil
6547 2018-10-20 17:47:20 Or anointing oil 
6548 2018-10-20 17:47:16 99% per cent of Alberta's oil is sent to America at a deep discount.  Judging by the tar-ponds and Alberta's devastated land-scape, oil from Alberta is hardly ethical.
6549 2018-10-20 17:47:14 Chef Kawasaki cut up some acne, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a blue stop sign, along with toothpaste.
6550 2018-10-20 17:47:13 Was suggested to try coconut oil on my beard. Gonna try that out
6551 2018-10-20 17:47:08 My guess..........Chinese Cyber Military inside Saudi Oil UAE, vying for Mid East position.  The cash positions of Tech companies, the last decade were Ad Click revenues and Zuckerberg and Facebook were based on this cash flow IPO pricing.
6552 2018-10-20 17:47:03 I just made a basic sweet roll dough in the bread maker, then cut pieces stretch out & throw in the deep fryer or any pan with an inch of oil or so.
After that you can put whatever you like on them.
I like butter & blueberry syrup.
6553 2018-10-20 17:46:54 Unfortunately, everyone involved in the oil business will fight tooth and nail to hang on to this old system
6554 2018-10-20 17:46:53 Two observations this morning:
First, SoCal is incredibly dry today.
Like use a gallon of body oil dry.

Next, it would be great if people in the fast lane actually would either drive fast, or move over for those who want to risk tickets. For the love of God.
6555 2018-10-20 17:46:45 Saudi Arabia is truly ISIS with Oil and UN recognition. This is a huge trouble for the region and the world at large cos they claim to be the de facto leader of the Muslim faithfuls.
6556 2018-10-20 17:46:36 Ok. I'll accept 2 litres of Pure Gold ...Cooking oil
6557 2018-10-20 17:46:35 Thanks for the comment, Andrew

As the article said

“Or more specifically, he voted against a non-binding measure opposing the idea.”

Not real sure what even means but it is a stretch for Cruz to say Beto wants higher taxes on oil
6558 2018-10-20 17:46:28 Murdered, tortured, dismembered, and covered it up. Little war and atrocities in Yemen could be taken into account as well. Using oil supply as a weapon via threats too. Yes, it is time to disassociate with Saudi Arabia.
6559 2018-10-20 17:46:21 Carminative oil is soothing as fuck.
6560 2018-10-20 17:46:16 hawaiian sea urchin and seasonal olive oil. . .20
quail and smoked daily pizza. . .9
pork belly and chicken crab rangoon. . .22
6561 2018-10-20 17:46:09 For US, electrify most US railroads with tax incentives (paid for by repealing oil depletion tax break). 

Use fuel taxes to pay 100% of streets, roads & highways ending $100 billion socialist subsidy to drive. Free market would move freight truck > RR.
6562 2018-10-20 17:46:04 How about phasing out oil???????? #hypocrite #cdnpoli #trudeaumustgo
6563 2018-10-20 17:46:00 Sorry for this reply.. May sound awkward.. Wie d Muslim NIMASA staffs, with all the hundreds of thousands dem dey collect n bonuses can't donate n build even if it's temporary Msqe.. Haba! 

Sorry once again!
6564 2018-10-20 17:45:57 1. Multi billion dollar weapon deals 2. Forefront against Iran/Hezbollah 3. Biggest oil reserve and we just can't afford to destabilize them However if we can replace this idiot MBS with another puppet and keep everything as is that would be the best outcome
6565 2018-10-20 17:45:41 The whole thing is am obvious ploy at a coup supported by many. Who is behind it? Ask the countries who don't like oil sanction. Primarily Russia, Iran and China. Every Western media outlet is complicit. You fucking embacilies!
6566 2018-10-20 17:45:16 In 1973, OPEC oil embargo begins.
6567 2018-10-20 17:45:14 Doc. This is one of those times I have to disagree with you. A majority of the 911 murderers were saudi nationals. They commit unspeakable evil everyday. We don't need their oil, we have our own. Without us, they would only be riding camels.

They can go pound sand.

6569 2018-10-20 17:45:11 You #selfishly wouldn't pay more for car ins that covers oil changes but govt health care makes you buy health ins for routine checkups.
6570 2018-10-20 17:45:00 I am waiting for a grilled chicken biscuit due to my peanut allergy (they use peanut oil for their waffle fries and fried chicken). My budget would then be in trouble.
6571 2018-10-20 17:44:59 Buhari got mad and said he will start drilling oil in the north, how far has he gone by nw? 
6572 2018-10-20 17:44:57 Why would we crush any perceived threat? Since it's how we keep people afraid and subservient to the almighty bank war oil god.
6573 2018-10-20 17:44:55 Don't care! Arabia chop people up all the time and we're still going to keep importing their oil to fill our cars ect... 911 did not stop us then so why is this news!?
6574 2018-10-20 17:44:38 It’s Saturday, and all I want to do is sleep and watch cartoons, but I have to get my oil changed. I’d rather die. Adulting is so hard. Just kill me pls. Dump my body in a vat of boiling acid.
6575 2018-10-20 17:44:38 Prose. Peen. Wish. Oil. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the Wish Nation attacked
6576 2018-10-20 17:44:36 @realDonaldTrump How about, Saudi Arabia sell the US oil at $3 per barrel for the next 50 years? 
That's better than executing 18 men who in all probability had nothing to do with the crime..
6577 2018-10-20 17:44:31 I know, the UCP idiots like to forget about the downturn in oil and that they didn't build any pipelines either. Then turn a blind eye to the fact that the NDP have turned the AB economy around in 3 years while making life better for a lot of people.
6578 2018-10-20 17:44:30 Then of course you gotta get 2 for 4 on oil cans
6579 2018-10-20 17:44:29 So you’re sayin I need to start doing my own oil changes?
6580 2018-10-20 17:44:29 If you could WIN One of my FREE Bottles of CBD OIL... WHAT Reason would you use it for?
6581 2018-10-20 17:44:15 Let me get this straight, you believe all taxes derived from North Sea oil & has, fall to the Scottish government? Are you for real?
6582 2018-10-20 17:43:56 It's been about power, money, good vs evil and domination for 5000 years. This isn't new. As to the Civil War and ALL WARS, all one needs to do is follow the money. It's all about the money including now Syria. It's about oil & gas pipelines through Syria via us or them. NotAssad
6583 2018-10-20 17:43:53 Pass the oil to @hanktheclank

6586 2018-10-20 17:43:21 You misunderstood Eric. He and his fathers only concern is their personal business relationship with the Saudis, not America’s. They will happily drag America through the mud to keep their mitts on all that oil cash, no matter how bloody it is.

6590 2018-10-20 17:43:07 Rich and powerful people in Saudi Arabia carried out 9/11. The Saudi gov kills & oppresses constantly. Our business deals prevail through it all. Our business is weapons and oil. One kills quick, the other kills slow.

Great decision-making, America.

#khashoogi #KhashoggiMurder
6591 2018-10-20 17:43:01 And oil. Which his admin has allowed free reign over US for decades to come. We got to move beyond OIL! Then none of these powerful ppl will control the world. Or at least US.
6592 2018-10-20 17:43:01 We've been there! Great food 
6593 2018-10-20 17:42:57 What jobs would those be? We’d likely have to increase domestic oil and gas production, so wouldn’t we see some job creation?

Regardless, I strongly support prioritizing human rights over short term, small scale economic concerns.
6594 2018-10-20 17:42:47 Kodwa Bandla why is cooking oil so critical to Zimbabweans? It’s always about the cooking oil. Can the place not operate sans cooking oil?

6596 2018-10-20 17:42:14 Eric must fear his dad. Answer to Eric's question: false equivalence.  The relationship will be there one way or the other.  We have leverage as a buyer of Saudi oil (and as a competitor, we can always pump more, which the Saudi's learned, in a painful lesson).
6597 2018-10-20 17:41:56 Mexican illegal immigrants working in America send more money back into Mexico, than the Mexican state-owned oil company Petróleos Mexicanos. How many illegal immigrants does it take to make more money than the state owned oil company...22 million? ...30?
6598 2018-10-20 17:41:25 yes, control of oil & gas is reason for government killing "rebels" now

which proves it is not genocide now

motivation/goal defines genocide
6599 2018-10-20 17:41:15 Who cares. Let the religious extremists kill themselves, Muslims, Jews, Christians, etc.. Then we’ll come in and take the oil.

6601 2018-10-20 17:41:13 Hey Mark, welcome to India, we use rockets to get oil price to moon..
6602 2018-10-20 17:41:12 Also, order was: sous vide with a bit of salt and olive oil for 5 hr at 77C, ice bath in bag ~5 minutes, remove from bag and marinate in BBQ sauce 1hr in fridge, place on grill with heavy basting of BBQ sauce ~2 min side. Turned out really great.
6603 2018-10-20 17:41:12 I'm amazed they haven't banned you yet Bob. Zapping is strictly non-contact, and baby oil plays havoc with the electronics.
6604 2018-10-20 17:41:12 Sell them weapons. If not someone else will. Stop importing their oil. That would hurt them more.
6605 2018-10-20 17:41:11 Diganle Oil, diganle Puma.. Para mi siempre va a ser Petro
6606 2018-10-20 17:41:09 Yeah,It sucks when a grown man feels patronized and discrespected,social helathcare removes the incentives to provide SERVICE!    go figure..Norway is a little different because its a petrostate,they tax the oil industry for a whopping 80%
6607 2018-10-20 17:40:48 Carpetbaggers, get away from Florida.  Oil is retro. Renewables all the way.
6608 2018-10-20 17:40:45 Bio oil it’s expensive but it works
6609 2018-10-20 17:40:37 Lmao I have a yt but I’ll just give you my routine. It’s basically African black soap, a spin brush, Indian healing clay, Derma roller for dark spots, bio oil for dark spots, and the $1 coco butter stick from the beauty supply

6612 2018-10-20 17:40:22 I often wondered if we let the Saudis off because of oil. My hubby fought in Persian Gulf War. Over oil. Im so tired of oil. And weapons. Of war. And US treats both active duty, retired & vets like 3rd class citizens!!

6619 2018-10-20 17:40:01 Not everyone is blind to your blatant bullhorn amplification of Conservative propaganda. 

Oil prices had just crashed. Liberals prevented nation wide recession while Oil dependent provincial economies responded to a contracting economy. Albertan response was similar and

6626 2018-10-20 17:39:22 Estoy llevando el carro de mi hermana a cambiarle el aicete y filtro and my dumbass steps in the biggest puddle of oil ever created
6627 2018-10-20 17:39:19 That may have been a factor historically, but nowadays only 8% of the oil we use comes from Saudi Arabia.
6628 2018-10-20 17:38:28 Looks like this Saudis have found their patsy. Hope he takes the fall and takes the heat off of MBS. Sweep the story under the rug all because we (US) are afraid of oil market manipulation and economic damage.
6629 2018-10-20 17:38:24 At the car dealership getting my oil changed. I brought it here because they told me the first one was free. It's been over an hour now. I feel like I'm paying for it somehow.

6632 2018-10-20 17:38:01 So I guess you have it all solved are Are already in the penalty faze.  Now you want to pull a Jimmy Carter and cause another 1970's like global oil crises.  Back to the future.
6633 2018-10-20 17:37:54 What kind? Mom gives me NatureMade Burpless Fish Oil. She pokes the capsule with a toothpick and drizzles it on my wet food. I'll even eat the flavors I don't like if they have fish oil on them!
6634 2018-10-20 17:37:54 During both World Wars, the country instituted rationing of multiple resources, including meat and oil. This proves that it is more than possible to begin implementing these policies on a national level in order to lessen our impact on climate change
6635 2018-10-20 17:37:35 They had no gas to go and get the oil. Italy occupied Lybia that had and still has some of the biggest oil fields in the world. They where right on top of it, but they didn't know.

6639 2018-10-20 17:37:17 High taxes? Bullshit, Dougie. Ontario has among lowest business taxes in Canada and North America. And you aren't reversing hydro privatization so don't tell us you're going to lower hydro rates without same Liberal-style rebates (like Eves did in 2002-3!). Snake oil Tory BS.

6658 2018-10-20 17:35:10 This shows how stupid Americans are. If we reduce our production of oil by mm2 barrels only, the barrel price will jump to $200 and then a jerk like U can use his ass to go to work

6661 2018-10-20 17:34:53 Accept the new fact that we no longer need your oil and your role of leadership in the world has just been undermined by your beloved Prince. MBS now stands for Murdered By Saudis! Fuck right off and take your antiquated ideas of societal norms with you!

6672 2018-10-20 17:33:26 I agree but we keep buying their oil and they buy our planes, tanks, guns etc. Until we have sustainable  renewable energy we will need someone’s oil or gas and it will be a long time before we are.

6674 2018-10-20 17:33:25 Blatant propaganda. Oil prices were gutted in 2015 leading to a worldwide recession and a subsequent push to implement austerity measures. Liberals opted to expand debt to protect middle class and poor from contraction of economy. Stop lying!

6719 2018-10-19 23:57:25 The companies that are currently developing our oil industry are actually energy companies, if there was a reliable magic alternative energy source that was even a tick profitable without overburdening hoops to jump through, they would all be on it like flies to you know what.
6720 2018-10-19 23:57:14 Still waiting for that pic or it didnt happen I meant people scared by motor cars and new to riding needing separate lanes. It's good for all our health and moving towards the no oil engine use by the 2020's. You bought all the Oatly Barista and keep it in your boot?!?

6723 2018-10-19 23:56:44 If the world did it, that would be a great solution. Oil has been a very mixed blessing/curse for much of the middle east.

6726 2018-10-19 23:56:19 Right, although not so sure on "our response" part, global policing better be left alone. Nevertheless, this is an interesting litmus test: oil is involved. Lets just see who ends up "cutting the crap"
6727 2018-10-19 23:56:05 アロってる
6728 2018-10-19 23:56:02 Time to cancel all current and future Saudi military purchases. Put a tax on any oil from Saudi Arabia. Put the tax $ into funding alternative energy.

6734 2018-10-19 23:55:29 So I got a nail that is curling. I’ve been kicking with work boots on. OmgA #Canadian #curler. I scraped a bit of the top of the nail off, cut a V on the middle portion, and soaking it in Argan oil. Relief in ten minutes, don’t know why
6735 2018-10-19 23:55:26 I’d say foundation is the MOST IMPORTANT part of makeup as well as a primer. If you already have oily skin stay away from products that could coconut water, coconut oil, any excess oils will automatically make you look 10x more oily obviously.
6736 2018-10-19 23:55:13 not enough "natural hair stylists" care for your hair ive noticed. even the most popular salons ive gone to wont grease or oil your scalp after washing. Like is that legit not a thing ? you just gunna give me a protective style without protecting my roots

6739 2018-10-19 23:54:46 Well don't drive, ride a bike. Buy tools, etc. All made buy machines that use oil. Better grow and make your own stuff. If your so worried about climate change. Remember world was covered in water. The waters are still receding.why would u find cites under water.

6746 2018-10-19 23:53:27 Don’t get me wrong, I love my natural wavy ass dried out frizzy ass hair and I’ve been embracing it a lot lately. Well actually me and my hair have a love/hate relationship. If I was 2007 Britney I’d shave that shit. But I’m not so I’ll just keep straightening & using olive oil.

6750 2018-10-19 23:52:51 Liberals must have taught the Saudis on lying!! This is very sad. They have oil and control,  nothing will happen as a consequence. Blame the minions and the higher ups hide and cover.
6751 2018-10-19 23:52:32 America and others countries should stop  purchasing oil from Saudis Arabia as there as bad as Iran !
6752 2018-10-19 23:52:30 They are key in working with us and Israel to try to deter Iran from taking over the Middle East. Lot more to consider than oil
6753 2018-10-19 23:52:19 You should try having a couple drops of cbd oil daily, natural remedy.. works for me..
6754 2018-10-19 23:52:07 I decided to try CBD oil this week. I’m really impressed with the effect it’s had on my mood and an annoying tremor I’ve been having.
6755 2018-10-19 23:52:03 And our government's willingness to let it slide. There is no amount of money, oil, or any trade with the Saudis that can justify this heinous murder, yet the entire GOP is A-OK with the "fist fight gone wrong" explanation. They think we'll forget. I won't. #KhashoggiMurder

6760 2018-10-19 23:51:06 There's a burden of proof that needs was met. I trust people who follow the rules. I don't trust those that try to misdirect and constantly lie. Trumpist are cultist who are being led by either greed, fear, racism, or ignorance to follow a con man snake oil salesman
6761 2018-10-19 23:51:03 It seems there's discussion of what it's reasonable to ask from Saudi Arabia as penance for having, in cold blood, beaten, murdered, and dismembered a journalist.

It's pretty revolting, but apparently we still want oil for guns. What if we got them to stop bombing Yemen, though?

6768 2018-10-19 23:50:13 I believe the “price of oil” argument is a hoax. Had  been working on energy efficiency instead of lining his pockets with Exxon kickbacks, we wouldn’t be being discussing it. Now we’re told we are hooked on Saudi oil like it’s an Opioid epidemic and we can’t kick the addiction

Severe sanctions are now the only option, & we’ll just have to handle what it does to oil prices. Murder must be punished!
6788 2018-10-19 23:48:46 Gotta figure it would be harder to take blood money rather than oil money.   Guess that doesn’t apply to all.  You’ve got a lot in common with the #KushnerCrimeFamily and @realDonaldTrump #KashoggiMurder

What did Obama do when we lost people in Benghazi. 
The US can't scold The Saudis bc we can't afford to lose their oil, their money and we sure don't want them to be friends with China
6799 2018-10-19 23:47:32 As for calling to an end to the oil economy, I don't know that there is a specific resolution that I can point to, but I think the green party worldwide stands for transitioning immediately 2 fully renewable resources for transportation and generating power. Thanks for the query.
6800 2018-10-19 23:47:02 And we've contributed to them having a pretty significant influence on the price of oil so they have leverage and we refuse to condemn them on all their bullshit.

Calling For Trump To Implement All Kinds Of Sanctions Against Saudi Arabia & Also Freeze Royal Family And Other Higher Up's Bank Accounts!

6802 2018-10-19 23:47:01 @TuckerCarlson When the Mexican economy got busted by the oil companies and Citibank and Chase in 1985-86, and the farmers got their wish for surplus farm labor from the SAWS/IRCA provision, they could grow higher profit, high risk crops which require huge amts of surplus labor.

6815 2018-10-19 23:45:47 Haha did you know that the US purchased Alaska from the Russians for $7.2m in 1867 and now 25% of America’s oil comes from Alaska... how about that ROI.

6820 2018-10-19 23:45:15 The US needs to replace fossil fuel with other sources of power. Solar, wind, geothermal, tidal etc. If the US punishes the Saudis,  to the extent needed, and they respond with turning off the oil spigot, oil goes to 400$/ barrel. So they do what they want.

6823 2018-10-19 23:45:00 Can we finally stop involving ourselves with this country?  None of these constant human rights abuses are worth a relationship for cheap oil.
6824 2018-10-19 23:44:59 Is not convenient for the US to go to war with Saudi Arabia. US protects their oil and the US is back by oil or petro dollar. Imagine a war. Dollar would sink like u have no idea.
6825 2018-10-19 23:44:54 NEWSFLASH! Big oil ARE the owners of Alberta oil resource. Only if we had a provincially or nationally owned oil company could we call it ours.

Weakening the Saudis isn't worth the 1000s of extra deaths due to Iran as well as handing Iran an oil card.
Whatever they do it will be relatively cosmetic.
It's not like the Saudis have ever been angels.

6876 2018-10-19 23:38:52 In 1971 Nixon announced that we would go to “fiat” system where the US dollar would basically be backed by the US government’s ability to tax us! And this system worked only because the US got into an alliance with Saudi Arabia whereby OPEC would sell oil only in US dollar.
6877 2018-10-19 23:38:37 this's so ridiculous ,the amount of lies, the government really think ppl will believe this stupid story, but then I find so many ppl defending them, so I give up, Y'all are hopeless, rot in ur ignorance, rot with ur oil that blinds you.

6878 2018-10-19 23:38:32 After looking up your model and year the only thing that comes up is how to reset the check oil light. That may have the same effect as a ford, but it might not.
6879 2018-10-19 23:38:28 But they have oil so let’s be friends
6880 2018-10-19 23:38:27 @ChrisCuomo In Europe they have been having such caravans for at least five years THANKS TO USA sticking their nose into Arab countries because they want the oil under the excuse to 'show them how to live'. MILIIONS of people died thanks to USA. SHAME ON YOU SELFISH BASTARDS!
6881 2018-10-19 23:38:27 Me: your total is 21.49
Woman: how much was the argan oil shampoo?
Me: 13.89
Woman: that's not what the tag said, the tag said it was 12.49
Me: I can take it off if you want me to.
Woman: no I want it for 12.49
Me: (overrides it) okay, your total is now 20.09
6882 2018-10-19 23:38:10 Yes, electricity is mostly hydro. However, almost all its transportation is oil based.

6885 2018-10-19 23:37:55 @DailyZeitgeist So, Saudi Arabia and the oil export is too big and too important? Double down on Renewable energy right?
6886 2018-10-19 23:37:55 Oil production cut in half. Could get ugly.
6887 2018-10-19 23:37:47 Kmt no one threaten the u s a with oil and gets away. None MBs your numbers or up.
6888 2018-10-19 23:37:45 What can they do? Not pay us for already delivered weapons? Threaten to stop the flow of oil? Send a sand storm in our direction???
6889 2018-10-19 23:37:45 Ok FB.
Best stuff for dry nipples. Coconut oil isn’t cutting it.

6890 2018-10-19 23:37:25 Might fuck around and purchase an essential oil diffuser
6891 2018-10-19 23:37:25 I'm all good with the oil and gas industry and agree with much of what he said. Except I'd rather keep that oil for things such as medicines rather then energy to push a person around
6892 2018-10-19 23:37:24 I bought stocks on every major drop. When the Oil Embargo hit I bought, Y2K, 2008, and I’ve kept all records to prove my buys. Most I sold after a move up over ten percent minimum. Some like Diasonics DIA I made 500% three times till it was bought out.
6893 2018-10-19 23:37:21 Today I bought the essential oil they use in Flight of Passage/Soarin’ & my room smells ELITE now
6894 2018-10-19 23:37:19 Believe what you want, as I will.  Just calm down before smash an oil vial.
6895 2018-10-19 23:37:19 I know, it’s almost like setting up a puppet state who’s only job is to supply oil to the West dirt cheap with fundamentalist leadership would lead to shit like this.

6905 2018-10-19 23:35:03 Got the oil changed in my Duramax today. Dealership gave me a car to drive with the automatic start/stop engine. Who's the moron that came up with that idea?!  #youbetternotmesswithmydiesel
6906 2018-10-19 23:34:55 Are you really basing your vote on an oil tax? Not gun violence or education or healthcare or human rights ( after birth)? Is your commute that bad?
6907 2018-10-19 23:34:50 Sorry, but the “ITCH” needs to shut her lying mouth. It’s taking this long to acknowledge the murder of Jamal Khashoggi by the Crown Pig Prince MBS. The whole family are thugs and murders. REMEMBER 9/11. These thugs give us 9/11, never forget George Bush covered for them, WHY:OIL

6909 2018-10-19 23:34:28 Veganism is indifferent to environmentalism/animal suffering. It's based on outdated logic. Some vegan crops are bad for environment (palm oil, almonds, etc). You can have dogs kill hundreds of rats in a field then plant a crop on top & use lots pesticides, it will be "vegan".

6930 2018-10-19 23:30:55 No we aren't. We're soulsearching as a country, trying to decide what we're going to do about being dependent for money and oil on a murderous hereditary dictatorship that tortures, murders and dismembers its own citizens. THIS is why renewable energy is so important.

6941 2018-10-19 23:29:48 That is all true, but, they are the linchpin to some sort of stability in the middle east. If you turn completely away from them you will drive up the cost of opec oil and put israel more in peril. We may be on the road to energy independence, but we arent there yet.
6942 2018-10-19 23:29:40 It depends...

6943 2018-10-19 23:29:36 They "care" about Jamal Khashoggi to try to give political cover to the Swampy Congress that could pass laws to "punish" Saudi Arabia in the hope of scuttling the $400 billion investments deal & $100 billion military purchases deal as well as cause oil price hike retaliation.

6949 2018-10-19 23:28:54 Great question Senator. As a follow-up, can you ask why the government (in conjunction with state governments) continue to promote flawed transport policies that continue to lock in car dependence and thus dependence on foreign oil. #auspol
6950 2018-10-19 23:28:43 @PontiacGunfire @OzKFodrotski the saudis artifically suppressed the price of oil via OPEC for multiple years to fuck the iranians. Recently.

6953 2018-10-19 23:28:34 There's this commercial that comes on the radio here that starts out like "what happens if you go 50,000 to 100,000 miles without getting your oil changed?" First of all, your car would legit die long before you ever got close to 50,000 miles. Have these people ever driven a car?
6954 2018-10-19 23:28:31 Oil is sold into the global market and bought from the global market at the going global market rates.  Do you want us to put America First and exit the global oil market?
6955 2018-10-19 23:28:30 I choose @tedcruz for @TXSen because facts are stubborn things for @betoorourke. In the #TexasDebate, Beto claimed he didn’t vote in favor of a $10-a-barrel tax on oil, but the record shows he did… #ChooseCruz #TexasTownHall

6959 2018-10-19 23:28:19 Does it matter? Not a US citizen. Not much we can do about it. If we punish the Saudi’s they raise oil prices and stop helping us in the region. They buy their weapons from China or Russia. Oh and we murder people all the time too. Let it go. Their problem, not ours.
6960 2018-10-19 23:28:10 Apparently the @WhiteHouse and donny, the traveling snake oil salesman, need daily reminders of the suffering of Americans due to recent hurricanes... Current administration is #UnableToGovern
6961 2018-10-19 23:27:57 ...and also to the regulatory compliance people at a large oil company, I can tell you that, absolutely, companies cut corners and get away with it, regulators get lazy or they don't want to do all the paperwork, or both.

6967 2018-10-19 23:27:20 What about the price?
Saudi arabia can increase the price of oil by 10 $ just by saying they will reduce production!
No need for doing
6968 2018-10-19 23:27:19 Yes, I suppose it would be better to go back to Iran for our oil supply, and hope once again, that they will stop chanting "Death to America."

I'm tweeting this of my volition because they handled my issues the way I think every company should.
6981 2018-10-19 23:26:01 From what I heard from numbers expert! Saudi would last 10 years with out pumping out single drop of oil.  Don’t think world market would stand against that. Also, who would stop 110b deal! Doubt that.
6982 2018-10-19 23:26:00 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund, until recently it had the publisher of the National Enquirer on its board, it has a mandate to support the oil companies and is actively working to introduce US style conservatism to Canada.
6983 2018-10-19 23:26:00 Default on it. The entire region has the gdp of Finland without oil and they have no idea how to get it out of the ground.

6987 2018-10-19 23:25:20 The entire world benefits from Saudi Arabia's oil production. 

Turkey President Erdogan, the driving force of the accusation, arguably has done worse things in recent history. 

And while I condemn unsanctioned murder, there is talk of journalist Khashoggi being a spy or worse.
6988 2018-10-19 23:25:13 This was a horrible crime but I’d really rather not turn Saudi Arabia into an enemy, create chaos, let far  worse Iran take over Middle East, or end up w $200 oil.  The Saudis need to pay a price but let’s not be harder on our allies than our enemies. That would be stupid.

7004 2018-10-19 23:23:19 Canada gave Saudis the high hat and cleaned house. We don’t care about their oil and money. American politicians and businesses do and will let its citizens be murdered and cover it up. What is one man, one woman, one child worth? More than oil, condo’s, yacht’s, weapon’s?
7005 2018-10-19 23:23:16 We are all increasingly horrified that the Saudis are rounding up the “usual suspects” and that President Emoluments is going to accept their lame cover story for MBS and go on with oil and arms business pretty much as if nothing happened.

7018 2018-10-19 23:22:04 We can provide enough oil for ourselves
Embargo now

7021 2018-10-19 23:22:00 It's not us they hold oil over, its EU and Asia. Their stabilty is our concern though
7022 2018-10-19 23:21:54 its not even drama at this point like ur just dumb.
7023 2018-10-19 23:21:49 Depends. Does your friend control the world’s oil supply and have an unlimited budget for armaments?

7026 2018-10-19 23:21:32 It’s a means of distraction that has a solid degree of traction because of The Swamp creatures involved vis a vi KSA, Turkey, Iran & Qatar.

Lots of , geopolitics, weapon programs, oil and gas (Levant) involved. 

An extensive cast of characters involved.
7027 2018-10-19 23:21:28 That’s one reason we should be investing more in renewable energy. If they couldn’t profit from their oil as much, they’d b forced to either modernize, or wither away.
7028 2018-10-19 23:21:18 I smell like candy 
My body oil gaddemit!
7029 2018-10-19 23:21:15 Thats like saying oh, we dont need to clean this vehicles filtration system because it is after all a filtration system and on top of that, lets just put the wrong gas/oil in too..like what kind of logic. Good God almighty...i do have faith in humanity but stuff like this is just
7030 2018-10-19 23:21:14 The Texas chain saw massacre guy and Michael Myers (the serial killer, not the comedian and actor) and Michael Vorheese, again serial killer not actual person and of course Freddie Kruger. These oil guys don't mess around, they only hire the best to work at the consulate.

7032 2018-10-19 23:21:01 This is not the point. Trump has money invested in SA. Vast amounts. He stupidly believes that SA will protect America. Not. Ever. This is the spin you idiots. They get sanctioned? Oil will become irretrievable. THEY will sanction America!
7033 2018-10-19 23:20:56 Heads will probably literally roll over this and everything will return to normal. 
Barbaric as it is, in a nutshell, one group of extremists killed another extremist. Happens every day.
7034 2018-10-19 23:20:49 Bullshit. Saudi Arabia created Al Qaeda and ISIS. Saudi Arabia continues to fund ISIS in Syria and Iraq, to destabilise their ability to produce oil. Iran is defeating ISIS and I hope they eventually bring down the Saudi regime.
7035 2018-10-19 23:20:29 No one needs their oil. There is plenty elsewhere to go around. End their inhumane reign now.

7039 2018-10-19 23:20:07 @SenMajLdr @LindseyGrahamSC
A man has been brutally murdered by an "ally" that you want to sell weapons to and get oil from after you trash Iran. Trump knows the truth. Jared likely does too. And so do you. How much blood are you willing to have on your hands?

7045 2018-10-19 23:19:41 Nothing like a fresh juice with almond butter, fresh berries, and non-GMO coconut oil to start the day. Feeling blessed.
7046 2018-10-19 23:19:40 Nothing's worse than being abused by customers and your bosses than being abused by customers and your bosses while you reek of chicken grease and oil
7047 2018-10-19 23:19:35 Yes Ma’am protect those oil companies please.   Forget sustainable energy sources.
7048 2018-10-19 23:19:31 Most-all of the terrorists in the 9/11 outrage were Saudis. Bush had Afghanistan bombed. Obama gave the order for Osama bin Laden to be killed.  But nothing much happened to Saudi Arabia because all western world leaders dare not upset them or the oil price will leap.
7049 2018-10-19 23:19:21 Hold on oil and gasthought this country didn’t need it,all clean and green paid by itself???

7060 2018-10-19 23:18:37 So Tom, you'd stop working with the Saudis? maybe run oil up to 200 a barrel... drive them into the hands of the Russians... and feed the Hamas/Hezbola/Iran alliance? Let's not chop off our nose to spite our face!

7063 2018-10-19 23:18:28 Elon Musk is an idiot he can mass produce electric cars and then literally end the western world’s ties with Saudi Arabia’s oil but no he wants them to be expensive and exclusive 
7064 2018-10-19 23:18:25 Losing Klef or nurse would set the oil back... a lot!
7065 2018-10-19 23:18:23 So much outrage over this reporter(what about #Benghazi, s killed by illegals,child sex slaves?)Those deaths don’t try to stall the S.A./war on the #DeepState cabal, ISIS,Iran’s nuclear program or drive up oil prices.
7066 2018-10-19 23:17:59 He said oil on the stairs 
7067 2018-10-19 23:17:58 Why do I think putting a face mask on and leaving coconut oil in my hair is gonna fix all my problems
7068 2018-10-19 23:17:48 have to wonder how the Texas race would be going had Ted Cruz not made himself nationally famous as a spineless oil slick with a skink for a mouth

7070 2018-10-19 23:17:19 all Dan has proven with this tweet is oil and gas employees are selfish and only look out for themselves
7071 2018-10-19 23:17:19 If you have been anxious It has a lot to do with it :( put your favorite essential oil on it  xo
7072 2018-10-19 23:17:16 USA are big fans of Saudi Arabia because they have oil. 14 of the 15 ppl in the planes on 9/11 were from Saudi Arabia and yet they attack another country of people that look like them.
7073 2018-10-19 23:17:11 my expression of love is gifting fragrances. scented candles, incense, pillow sprays, cologne/perfume, essential oil blends [sometimes in my handmade body butter whips lmao].
7074 2018-10-19 23:16:48 We only get 11% of oil from Saudi. We get 40% from Canada. What allies would we lose? What Jobs would we lose. Saudi needs us, way more than we need them.
7075 2018-10-19 23:16:46 something else a lot of people think the Saudis lie about is oil reserves. Probably not nearly what they claim. So all their power, all our kissing up to the nation that was actually behind 9/11 and other horrors? It's all to have access to something that may not exist. (sigh)
7076 2018-10-19 23:16:35 Look, the Saudi's have been deliberately keeping the Middle East unstable for decades in order to get the West to prop them up with arms and oil money. Just pull the plug and so much shit goes away.
7077 2018-10-19 23:16:25 And yet, not a soul will believe it.  Hafta say, them Saudis coulda done better, like maybe with insurrectionist  underlings who did it to besmirch princey.  Off with their heads, yadda yadda.  For a coupla qts of oil  even I coulda come up w something.
7078 2018-10-19 23:16:09 He has a reprieve, due to oil prices.
7079 2018-10-19 23:16:06 So , two of the biggest #mafias of the #world #SaudiArabia & #USA , killed & covered the horrible killing of the journalist #JamalKhashoggi !
Wow! 
Because we can’t ignore deals for #oil & #weapons !!!!!
Or maybe the #Iranians or #Russians killed him?!
7080 2018-10-19 23:15:52 They had the. Monopoly on oil, now they need another bullet to hold the West hostage
7081 2018-10-19 23:15:51 #SaudiArabia are rat killers who’ve used filthy oil money to buy silence & access in DC & around world, crypto Islamic-fascists-We’ve wrongly made Iran boogey man. He’s been living in #Riyadh whole time. Remember 9/11-Remember African embassies-Remember UssCole Remember Khashoggi
7082 2018-10-19 23:15:35 Same! I was like nope I am not waiting a whole week & I do admit I took castor oil to get shit going I genuinely believe he would’ve stayed in there the entire week too lol
7083 2018-10-19 23:15:29 mmmmmm crunchy
7084 2018-10-19 23:15:29 Cut there oil off and fire arms off until they tell the real truth not Trumps truth 
7085 2018-10-19 23:15:19 Oh, so Premier Notley caused an oil recession?

That's magic!
7086 2018-10-19 23:15:16 I choose @tedcruz for @TXSen because facts are stubborn things for @betoorourke. In the #TexasDebate, Beto claimed he didn’t vote in favor of a $10-a-barrel tax on oil, but the record shows he did… #ChooseCruz #TexasTownHall
7087 2018-10-19 23:15:15 I start my new job on Monday! I'm very stressed!! Then I went to pick up some facial oil for winter dryness from a spa near my house and now they're giving me a free holistic facial tonight. I'm so excited to relax.

7090 2018-10-19 23:14:40 Why isn’t there enough money for healthcare, education and infrastructure if the TX is booming? Why are oil executives making record salaries while laying off workers? #VoteBetoForTexas
7091 2018-10-19 23:14:36 For oil cartridge? That's the only way to go!!
7092 2018-10-19 23:14:36 @DixonEnergyNJ Thanks for fucking me over for the weekend, leaving me out of oil and, therefore, out of heat after assuring me on Thursday and Friday that I'd get my delivery.
7093 2018-10-19 23:14:26 okay so i’ve heard a lot of good things about essential oils helping with anxiety but i’ve heard they can be poisonous to cats? do i have any essential oil experts following me
7094 2018-10-19 23:14:25 But dependent foreign oil? He can't keep touting economy as his success benchmark. But hey, you want your kid growing up wondering what a national park was, you can explain fracking. What's sad is I feel sorry for him. Just don't get it... #BlueWaveIsComing
7095 2018-10-19 23:14:25 If you had only shown as much enthusiasm for Benghazi.

7104 2018-10-19 23:13:14 I changed my oil in my mower by myself.  I spilled oil in my yard (again) and it took me a half hour to start it but I did it!!!  And I’m pretty fucking pumped about it!!!  
7105 2018-10-19 23:13:11 Any other country after such a hideous act would have been condemned and exposed to severe punishment but this Devil has a cup full of black wine #Oil and every nation on earth is drunk from it except nothing but diplomacy. #JamalKashoggi #SaudiKillsJamalKhashoggi

7108 2018-10-19 23:12:17 Time to cut ties with Saudi Barbaria, America! 
Canada has oil too!
7109 2018-10-19 23:12:13 It’s called ethics.  MBS and Putin are birds of a feather.  We do not need Saudi oil. They may have been complicit in 911.  Bad actors, not allies
7110 2018-10-19 23:12:11 If he decide to do anything stupid . The soudis could do one simple thing that wil make the American life much more difficult that it is now which is changing the currency used to sell their oil from dollar to let’s say their own currency.

7114 2018-10-19 23:11:53 The House of Saud is not acquainted with the truth. Nothing but bold faced lies to the Western world since the first Arab oil embargo. They have never been our friends.

7120 2018-10-19 23:11:05 Fall guys. We should settle for no less then the Crown Prince stepping down or cut Saudi Arabia off.  We don't need there oil.  We're energy rich.  Will Trump step up & be a leader?  We can do arms deal without the Prince.  He's needs to go. Not up for debate.
7121 2018-10-19 23:11:00 Oil and natural gas plays a big role in your daily life! Add your name to show your support!

7123 2018-10-19 23:10:51 For instance all of the oil companies are in Iraq stealing oil as planned all along. The atrocities committed in all countries USA invades are human rights violations. Terrorism is an USA psyop. 2/2

7126 2018-10-19 23:10:30 Eventually we have to accept that we are facilitating a state that stones people to death and only recently allowed women to drive cars. Let’s face it, if they didn’t have oil, we’d have ostracised them decades ago.
7127 2018-10-19 23:10:30 So the oil money made them wasteful failing socialist? Hugo’s family have billions in the bank but not so much for the peons.

7136 2018-10-19 23:09:54 Watch though. Since a bunch will go to jail (or worse), we can declare the problem all wrapped up and continue as usual.    Big bucks to be made.  Oil to import.  Middle East balance.  And such.  Yawn.

7140 2018-10-19 23:09:36 The trade in oil and weapons will trump everything else. But, I am such a cynic that when a baby smiles I put it down to wind rather than happiness.
7141 2018-10-19 23:09:36 That’s what i said.. like a car or bike.. you need your pressure checked and oil changed.. i was right 
I’ll bring my tools then..
*you need to wash that mind girl*
7142 2018-10-19 23:09:21 I leave the group chat for just a second, and come back to @deipictions offering to teach @queuethorn Turkish oil wrestling
7143 2018-10-19 23:09:19 Jogging success!
7144 2018-10-19 23:09:18 They're some sick people 
They cut his fingers off and dismembered him 

That's religion and these are our allies? 

They can call me whatever they don't we have our own oil what have these globalist the United States into 

They are barbaric !!!
7145 2018-10-19 23:09:10 Saudis are horrible people. We live in an unfortunate world where they unfortunately are our only allies in the Middle East. Russia or China will still supply them with weapons and we lose oil.
7146 2018-10-19 23:08:51 RUB ME DOWN IN SOME HOT OIL BABY...
Just turn off the lights.. and let me get closer..
7147 2018-10-19 23:08:48 It’s a mixture of an economic bubble that is slowly being burst by the fact that Houston inside the loop is very diverse. I can’t wait till the oil bubble here crashes and reality hits these people
7148 2018-10-19 23:08:36 #Hardball lol They're all Fighting over MidEast oil & it's not even going 2B part of the Future-
7149 2018-10-19 23:08:36 The Saudis have never, ever been honest with the United States. The United States has militarily built that Nation, which has paid terrorist to attach America. Maybe North Korea will pay 400.00 a barrel for their oil. In 30 days we'll get about Trumped up cover-up.
7150 2018-10-19 23:08:33 Exactly. F*cking precisely! It's not even about the oil!!!!!!! It's, literally, about the corrupt influence of individual wealthy interests on the Saudi dole influencing foreign policy in Western democracies to protect their own beach houses! It's fucked!
7151 2018-10-19 23:08:31 Olive oil in pan, put in 1 tomato sliced into large cubes. Fry for like a minute or 2 on medium, then add 3 eggs for every large tomato you fried. Salt pepper. Eat with pita or in sandwich.
7152 2018-10-19 23:08:13 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
7153 2018-10-19 23:08:13 Bring back the Flaming Oil Rig from the 06 playoffs.
7154 2018-10-19 23:08:08 The thing about bone saws is that diplomats always have them on hand.

You have no idea how often bones come along that need to be sawed at foreign embassies. It’s just a daily occurrence.

Really nothing to see here. Who wants some more delicious oil?
7155 2018-10-19 23:08:04 They're laughing right now in Riyadh...probably having a sword dance around a 18 deplorables about to ignite or beside a rock pile about to be stoned..."Kushner and Trump can spin that one to their base...how many homes and cars still use oil in the USA?"  Better Call Vlad...Arms
7156 2018-10-19 23:07:53 The oil in this “nkatie bogar” has expired 
7157 2018-10-19 23:07:48 Lol no, I ended up going with a lemon infused olive oil, herbs and dijon for the lamb chops :)
7158 2018-10-19 23:07:36 Y’all can mock the church all you want, and talk smack about believers for as long as you please, but when Christ returns for his bride (the church) y’all gon wish you would have filled your lamp with oil.
7159 2018-10-19 23:07:32 They don’t need to be close to the US. They need to be friends of the 4 Horsemen. You know, the guys who own the majority shares of all the top 500 stocks in America. Who own the 4 biggest oil and insurance companies. And who own the Fed. And our politicians, Trump included.
7160 2018-10-19 23:07:30 Oil money at work. Small population big money.
7161 2018-10-19 23:07:24 No actually that’s not what I’ve been reading I’ve been reading he is a Saudi citizen living in the US That being said the more oil we produce here the less we have to do business with that country That wouldn’t bother me one bit
7162 2018-10-19 23:07:21 ささみさんのサマめちゃくちゃ““雄““ってかんじですごくすき…
7163 2018-10-19 23:07:00 I'm not sure where you're from, but I live in Texas as a native american Indian and along with thousands of Hispanic and black people work in the oil & gas industry and we are way better off with Trump. We laid-off 600 under Obama. We are hiring daily under Trump.
7164 2018-10-19 23:06:57 The enviro file is tough. He does need to be the PM of the entire country including Alberta. He doesn't want to alienate AB like his father did. And let's be honest, the whole country did well off AB oil when the prices were high.
7165 2018-10-19 23:06:45 Carbon tax is war on a false problem. CO2 a natural part of the environment. 

We need an environmental plan that reduces land, water and air pollution, urban sprawl, over packaging, single use  containers.

Extreme left seeking to destroy Oil and Gas industry
7166 2018-10-19 23:06:41 Apparently not. Setting one toe on U.S soil and claiming credible fear entitles you to due process, by law. Not being able to detain children over 20 days another ex. 
Exploiting law is how they are getting in. They need changing
7167 2018-10-19 23:06:25 I'd rather walk to work than buy these disgusting Saudis oil.

7169 2018-10-19 23:06:07 and the sooner they can't hold oil over us the better...
7170 2018-10-19 23:05:55 ...with an irresistable shit-ton of oil, and cash.
7171 2018-10-19 23:05:55 @FoxNews america doesnt need saudi oil. iran and iraq have oil , so does canada and united states. saudia arabia has a 450 million dollar retainer on trumps POLITICS?
7172 2018-10-19 23:05:54 In the words of Aaron Sorkin "We shdn't be debating whether to sell the guns to them. We shd be debating whether we *shoot* the guns at them!" Hyperbolic, no doubt, but we shdn't be talking arm sales; we shd be advocating a total embargo on Saudi oil.
7173 2018-10-19 23:05:54 If only we could be less reliant on oil... perhaps invest in renewables or something? Ohhhh
7174 2018-10-19 23:05:50 And thts how these lying oil producing tyrants will get away
7175 2018-10-19 23:05:43 Nothing will happen to SA with this one, because Saudi Arabia could stop pumping oil or fail to increase production when Iranian oil becomes subject to U.S. sanctions early next month, driving the price per barrel up dramatically for everyone if it does.

7177 2018-10-19 23:05:40 i bought sesame seed oil yesterday & so far it has been LIFE CHANGING & i’m upset that i’m only just now learning this
7178 2018-10-19 23:05:36 But he gets free oil changes and tire rotations. So it's really a steal 
7179 2018-10-19 23:05:27 President Trump, don't let the dems railroad you on this issue.  When the investigation is done, let congress decide on punishment for Saudi....if they want $200 barrel of oil, Saudi and Iran becoming allies so be it! Talk is cheap..put your money where your mouth is dems..
7180 2018-10-19 23:05:23 We can survive without their oil; we cannot continue to be a leader of the free world while we succumb to their whims. The same goes for Russia and China. The USA will always find a way to make it without the help of others. Way past time to sell our souls for a few bucks.
7181 2018-10-19 23:05:05 Your husband doesn't work for oil and gas?
7182 2018-10-19 23:04:58 My dear its bcos u av hair .if u dnt av....put anointing oil....it will nt grow
7183 2018-10-19 23:04:48 should I risk driving my car w no oil & an oil leak to go get cupcakes
7184 2018-10-19 23:04:45  Läs på om skifferolja och peak oil så har du något att fundera på om CO2 förhöjningarna som har ca 100år i fördröjning
7185 2018-10-19 23:04:37 But beware: products like oreo do contain palm oil!
7186 2018-10-19 23:04:23 Shale oil boom due to fracking technology
7187 2018-10-19 23:04:18 @realDonaldTrump no oil, coal or anything leaves Australia either!  Send National Guard out to watch for movement leaving Australia!  I am tired of it totally!  Really!
7188 2018-10-19 23:04:07 すきぃ！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！
7189 2018-10-19 23:04:01 Shorten wouldn’t do anything if he were PM either. It’s all about money and oil prices.
7190 2018-10-19 23:03:59 “We’ll behead a few guys we don’t like and blame the whole thing on them so we can continue to murder and enslave whoever we want. The US likes our oil and they like the money we spend buying their missiles and military tech too much to actually do anything. The US is our bitch.”
7191 2018-10-19 23:03:57 Use oil-free and paraben-free skincare and makeup products. Oil added to products and chemicals added are not good for your skin – especially if you are sensitive. READ LABELS!
7192 2018-10-19 23:03:56 Always amazed me how fracking is done at a depth of less than a mile & blamed for earthquakes which occurred several miles deep. Earthquakes were happening around the Midwest long before anyone thought of drilling for oil

& then there's Climate Change Bahahaha #MotherNature wins
7193 2018-10-19 23:03:38 Yet, they remain America’s proxy against Iran’s continual exporting of terrorism. They also play a significant role in our economy by virtue of their oil reserves while we squeeze Iran’s ability to sell theirs. Strange bedfellows no doubt...
7194 2018-10-19 23:03:38 Yeah, let’s translate that double talk. The Deep State needs it’s close ties with SA or they will drop the PetroDollar too. Or they might levy tariffs on Shell oil. Or something worse that causes money to be lost. Wake up people. No one cares about you. It’s all $$
7195 2018-10-19 23:03:36 Remember when Iraqis set fire to their own oil fields?
7196 2018-10-19 23:03:35 Totally okay with sitting here waiting to get an oil chance bc they’re playing “IT” on the tv 
7197 2018-10-19 23:03:06 Still employing: anyone willing to help in the garage on my polo.

Requirements: Decent upper body strength, no adversion to oil/grime/dirt/dust/rust/exposed metal/minor injuries, decent chat

Renumeration: free coffee/tea made by me, sometimes biscuits
7198 2018-10-19 23:03:00 The Saudis were just going to rough Jamal Kashoggi up, but then someone yelled “FATALITY!” and things got crazy, and look, would you like another cup of oil? Perhaps some intel sharing?

7200 2018-10-19 23:02:44  Moderater brukar lägga in känslor när det handlar om klimatförändringar, fakta skiter dom i, brukar rekommendera läsa på om peak oil och skifferolja, men vad hjälper det mot klimatförnekare?
7201 2018-10-19 23:02:42 Oil City Oilers Will  received the opening kick off
7202 2018-10-19 23:02:42 Well remember lot long ago Russia killed 2 UK people in there own country,  3 Weeks later they sign one of the biggest Gas deals .... you can't just walk away .. nor can you risk 250$ oil ... not over 1 guy .. he wasn't even a us citizen.. truth hurt?
7203 2018-10-19 23:02:41 I have! I used to get migraines rly bad and often, and I bought some and it helped a lot and I don't get them nearly as often now. The cbd oil was rly expensive tho, so I could only buy it the one time
7204 2018-10-19 23:02:35 Tanning oil 100% hahaha
7205 2018-10-19 23:02:27 Socialism progresses to fascism. Once the EU (german hegemony) have an army, they will go to war. Russia has all the oil and gas
7206 2018-10-19 23:02:14 We hope out of today  heartbreaking events, God grants us  new Era, a new Kingdom where the Crown in Constitution invites the People to govern wit the Crown through all their national productivity with their King, a new modern Saudi Kingdom going beyond one singular oil economy.

7209 2018-10-19 23:02:07 Are you starting with a hot pan and hot oil?
7210 2018-10-19 23:02:01 Use oil-free and paraben-free skincare and makeup products. Oil added to products and chemicals added are not good for your skin – especially if you are sensitive. READ LABELS!
7211 2018-10-19 23:01:39 He's a responsible employee of oil and gas who will lose his job if 112 passes.  So again, will you be paying our mortgage if it does?
7212 2018-10-19 23:01:31 Nothing will happen to Saudi Arabia because A) We want their oil B) We want the money they give us for our military tech.

So we’ll look the other way when they murder and enslave.

It’s fucked up and I blame all politicians that have played along regardless of party affiliation.
7213 2018-10-19 23:01:05 Afraid most of those countries "push" oil like dope. They get you hooked, you can't get off...and they know it.

7218 2018-10-19 23:00:47 Funny how you always comment negatively about Trump’s outbursts such as with North Korea. Suddenly you want a fast, unmeasured, whatever-happens-be-damned, response. 
Could there be possible implications he must consider?  Like if they shut off their oil to us? #NoMorePrivateJets
7219 2018-10-19 23:00:45 The squeaky wheel gets the oil
7220 2018-10-19 23:00:34 The Saudi s already sent a check for 100 million. And they. Want to buy military equipment. Turkey just needs a tanker full of oil and it’s all good

7237 2018-10-19 22:58:51 USA used to be the land of the free most people all looked up to. Now the land of oil and money and no morals. Australia, we can do better. Surely.
7238 2018-10-19 22:58:50 Good on you! That's great 
My dad's shown me, my sister & mum how to change oil, check oil, breaks & all the "basic" stuff so we can kinda look after ourselves, but it doesn't make me an expert & I don't pretend to be or want to be because I'm a "man"

7241 2018-10-19 22:58:37 And you would do what? Start a fight with the Saudis, then watch oil go up to $150.00 a barrel! Have gas go up to $15.00 a gallon, products double, maybe triple.

7253 2018-10-19 22:57:22 Ten years ago Chase would have been supporting a cap and trade climate bill and saying it would help reduce our dependence on foreign oil.  
We have both reduced emissions and become the leading oil producer thanks to fracking in the past ten years.

7263 2018-10-19 22:55:54 I think the fact that oil and profit are more important than human life has been obvious for a very long time. 
Especially if those lives are not white.
7264 2018-10-19 22:55:53 Seriously? If you don't know the US is in Syria illegally for OIL try some research.
7265 2018-10-19 22:55:51 best course long term is to continue shale development to keep USA top oil producer and to keep developing renewable especially nuclear fusion

7270 2018-10-19 22:55:17 True...except we create a plurality of the oil that's used in the U.S. today. The Saudis account for, if memory serves, less than 10% of the oil used in America.

7274 2018-10-19 22:54:56 You dont declare War on the best friend you have in the Middle East, The biggest arems buyer, the one that sells you the 20% Oil you need but then you lefties have all but lost their minds over Trump
7275 2018-10-19 22:54:56 Accidents don't happen they occur&this seems no accident.Saudi Arabia is a regime that has used to it's vast wealth through oil&oil reserves to do as it pleases.I doubt the UN will do anything as the USA,EU&UK  did nothing when mass murderer  Idi Amin
7276 2018-10-19 22:54:52 honestly who the fuck cares what suadi arabia did.. they chopped up a guy whoopdi do. They have oil that we need and everyone whos complaining about Saudi arabia will be crying when their gas prices go above 4 or 5 dollars.
7277 2018-10-19 22:54:42 Mawawala din yung pangingitim after mo manganak, cess!!  pero try mo bio oil. Yan yung gamit ko nung buntis ako. 
7278 2018-10-19 22:54:25 Filling: sauté 16 oz sliced mushrooms in avocado (or olive) oil over Med-high heat with 1 big minced shallot, and some fresh thyme. S&P to taste. Cool and add shredded gruyere, grated 1-2 Tblsp parm, and a Tblsp or 2 of whole milk ricotta for creaminess. Cool.
7279 2018-10-19 22:54:07 The Trump administration will support this until one of the fossil fuel corporations finds oil or other marketable mineral rights on the land or they want eminent domain. The Dakota Access Pipeline is on unceded Treaty (Ft Laramie Treaty of 1851) land  also.
7280 2018-10-19 22:54:03 Lol. Ooooh we really feel threatened. U chotya indians are tomato n gear oil suppliers to usa , we delivered ussr, premium. Ur contract worker. We are handlers. Balls no matter how big remain under dick, ur hired tattay of israel.
7281 2018-10-19 22:54:01 Yep. Even though our oil is at 21$ a barrel. No distribution or refining capacity.
7282 2018-10-19 22:53:46 Saudi, that was a very lame excuse. 

I could come up with better excuse if they pay me with just an oil well or an oil block
7283 2018-10-19 22:53:45 He campaigned on legal weed,protecting the environment and raise the middle class for those who want to join it
Well he taxed the middle class to raise up the workingclass
Protected the environment by landlocking oil in place without means of transport 
He also bought a pipeline

7285 2018-10-19 22:53:43 Carve an oil pressure gauge showing zero. That’ll scare anyone 
7286 2018-10-19 22:53:41 Use ororo or red oil 
7287 2018-10-19 22:53:40 It's absolutly odd to me how drs can give me so many drugs that are created in a lab for the chronic illness and the side effects are horrible. 1 dropped of cbd oil and im better than any drug.
7288 2018-10-19 22:53:34 It was sold to oil men, arms dealers, and a dodgy real estate tycoon with a massive pile debts.
7289 2018-10-19 22:53:25 Coal, oil, shippers, refiners and other fossil fuel providers give mahoosive $$$ to Congress critters. Who many $$$ have carbon eaters given? $$$ talks. Silence isn’t golden.
7290 2018-10-19 22:53:19 Welp.. getting my oil changed, tires rotated, and car washed for free. – bij Tempe Dodge
7291 2018-10-19 22:53:15 I’ve been avoiding eating Chick-fil-A during the week for a YEAR NOW because the kid I nanny is anaphylactic to peanuts and they cook in peanut oil. COME TO FIND OUT HE CAN HAVE PEANUT OIL (apparently it’s safe for his allergies) AND HE EATS CHICKFILA EVERY SATURDAY
7292 2018-10-19 22:53:04 those oil pot things you put the sticks in are fuckin whoop
7293 2018-10-19 22:52:58 Cooking oil.
7294 2018-10-19 22:52:50 Drive electric cars. Stop relying on Saudi Arabia for oil and save the environment
7295 2018-10-19 22:52:40 Some would say open borders, a former Secretary of State coaching Iranian leaders and rogue government agency comprises national security. A stronger military, less dependence on foreign oil and a stronger economy will help. There are many threats... leaders need to collaborate.
7296 2018-10-19 22:52:37 Top google search: can the world survive without Saudi oil? #Khashoggi @SkyNews @BBCBreaking @washingtonpost #saudi
7297 2018-10-19 22:52:35 How can you top a flaming oil derrick?
7298 2018-10-19 22:52:35 My phone is hanging already... Bad English from ABUSITES be giving man headache...
7299 2018-10-19 22:52:35 I used to work in oil & gas; company man would collect reports daily, follow up differences independently... biggest screwups sometimes started with “what did you get” conversations, propagating mistakes.. saw couple rig location errors too, usually datum conversation of old maps

7302 2018-10-19 22:52:22 Don't worry about us, soon the oil producing Shiite east will be liberated from saudi occupation.
7303 2018-10-19 22:52:17 Touchbar is apple’ “snake oil” to distract us from NOT providing a touch screen and like snake oil expensive and maybe useful to somebody.  Yea a bit upset at the price for nothing except better hardware specs
7304 2018-10-19 22:52:13 Sounds like a cop-out to me. Sounds like you have no ideas and you've put in no effort into fixing the issue. And on my other fronts... what's understood doesn't need to be explained. Snake oil salesman by day and incompetent councilor by night.
7305 2018-10-19 22:52:09 Haha! Oil is the thing. In a pinch vaseline or similar will work.
7306 2018-10-19 22:51:51 @ProfBrianCox Dear Brian, I have a theory, the universe is a big recycling plant. A red giant had to die for our solar system to be born. Everything here was here in the beginning in some form. Physical reincarnation exists, oil, chalk, coal, diamonds etc. Gautama had a point
7307 2018-10-19 22:51:38 The public cannot let this stand! 
Give TRUMP & Republicans hell on social media. 
Divest from stocks in Saudi businesses & corporations that do business in Saudi Arabia. 
Conserve energy. The less oil we use, the more SA suffers.
If Trump won't impose sanctions, we will.
7308 2018-10-19 22:51:36 Donald Trumps is shredding America's rights every single day with corruption oil and money. There was a fight 18 men and one man  you have to ask the question where is the man's body.
7309 2018-10-19 22:51:18 《オリーブ油の豆知識》

エキストラバージンオリーブオイルとはオリーブの果実を搾ってろ過しただけのバージンオイルです。
7310 2018-10-19 22:51:17 In other words, you just reside in a sad, cold desert that's surrounded by oil fields. 

Is that accurate?
7311 2018-10-19 22:51:10 Noice. You read anything about flax oil and polymerization? Thinkin that's how I may want to season
7312 2018-10-19 22:51:05 Your Big Oil short seller funding check will be withheld for 2 quarters and your hot pocket rations reduced by 50% as punishment. Now contemplate the error of your ways!
7313 2018-10-19 22:50:58 @TSNRyanRishaug ... Hey bud, thought you should know… Gregor just said that the predators power play which is two out of 10 was 10%… Have at er. #mathgenious
7314 2018-10-19 22:50:56 Do we really think Trump cares about that journalist? The bloke has the upper hand to get low oil and massive arms deals here. There will be no sanctions of any meaning at all
7315 2018-10-19 22:50:55 The level of desperation is obvious. 

But it doesn’t matter. 

Everyone will feign outrage, cancel their trip to the shindig and continue to buy their oil.
7316 2018-10-19 22:50:53 Saudi Arabia has no place on this earth. It is an insult to Muslims, non-Muslims, humanists and other religious or non-religious figures alike. It is - and I don’t exaggerate - an utter shithole dominated by an obsession with oil and oppression of minorities. I hope it collapses.
7317 2018-10-19 22:50:44 Actually I put oil in it 2 days ago so I don’t think it’s that 
7318 2018-10-19 22:50:36 No, just coconut oil and a little @pixie brown x
7319 2018-10-19 22:50:34 Looks delicious.
Only pumpkin seets in a frying pan?
Or roasted with something? Oil, sugar, ...?
They look so shiny.
7320 2018-10-19 22:50:23 9-11, now this. Do we really need their oil sooooo much that we put up with anything they do?
7321 2018-10-19 22:50:16 You should check the oil it probably doesnt even have any
7322 2018-10-19 22:50:07 Yeah - There was a big fight & he died. How come they insisted for two weeks he left the building? They are so confident that the US needs their oil & weapons they think a weak excuse like that is going to settle things.
7323 2018-10-19 22:49:49 Of course if the fat is vegetable oil.
7324 2018-10-19 22:49:48 Did y’all fuck with a ouji board- I swear to sweet baby Jesus. Get some sage, get a oil defuser and burn rosemary essential oil in it. I would also get medium.
7325 2018-10-19 22:49:45 Trump: I Spoke To the KinG of saudi AraBia and He said he diDn't kNoW Nothing about No KhashoGgis!

Saudi Government: Turns out, we killed the guy and cut up his body. 

Trump: 

Saudi: Also we have all the oil and we fund all of your politicians. 

Trump: We'Re goOd!
7326 2018-10-19 22:49:39 This just shows what utter contempt the Saudis and their good buddy Trump hold for the American public.  They know the GOP will choke down whatever they say in order to keep the oil and arm sales flowing.  They probably had a contest to see how ridiculous a story they could sell.
7327 2018-10-19 22:49:32 I agree, the Saudis outright murdered him. But what do you expect America’s reaction to be? Do you think we should go to war over this? Endanger our economy by cutting off Saudi oil? What do you think the response ought to be? They are barbarians but we need them 
7328 2018-10-19 22:49:31 What does SA do with their homeless? Execute them? Maybe you don’t have any poor? Idk? But they say SA will run out of oil by 2030 so be prepared 
7329 2018-10-19 22:49:29 No, its Olive oil. Cant you see it flowing 
7330 2018-10-19 22:49:28 寝る寝る寝る寝
7331 2018-10-19 22:49:27 Have you ever considered CBD Oil? A lot of our followers benefit from taking CBD for anxiety.
7332 2018-10-19 22:49:12 How to stop immigration? Go to those countries. Went to Iraq for oil. Why central America? A rich country like USA can make these countries change ways if helped. Look at country of PANAMA
7333 2018-10-19 22:49:12 So much sense, girllll. 

Got an egg guy that I give cash for 3-4 crates of egg each time my monthly allowance comes in (that's like ⅓ of the whole thing) I buy rice, beans, cooking oil and tomato paste with the rest. I save money each also to fill gas every 2 months.
7334 2018-10-19 22:49:11 Tugrik said they were amazingly delicious so when I saw delicata squash at the farm stand I went *yoink*!  They're in the oven now, with some olive oil and salt.
7335 2018-10-19 22:49:08 Honestly, for mentioning the Dean 
7336 2018-10-19 22:49:08 The very one. I know there was a red Douglas but I think he was American and unrelated. Big in the oil game, word has it. The Americans have good oil not like our rubbish.
7337 2018-10-19 22:49:08 僕を酸化させたらダメだよ。オイルにとって酸化は命取り。…僕を見守っててね⁇
7338 2018-10-19 22:49:07 OILって早く書くとサザエさんのテーマになるって事も知らない人多そうよな
7339 2018-10-19 22:49:06 No, he won’t. There is too much money and oil behind it. Let’s face it, the Saudis are thousands of years behind us.
7340 2018-10-19 22:49:06 Good call!!!  I love their food section but have never thought to look for  oil but I bet they have it!
7341 2018-10-19 22:49:05 @TeaPartyOrg You kno Trump allowed Saudi Arabia to buy U.S.'s biggest ( new) oil refinery in 2017, lost access permanently (to the Chinese) to TWO of the ores essential to manufacture of machine tools, & lied about 6 NEW U.S. Steel plants when there are NONE? So? No Tooth Fairy!
7342 2018-10-19 22:49:04 i love making concoctions of things lmaooo, like i just made myself a stretch mark cream by mixing the lotions i already use on my marks + some coconut oil. stay updated for my etsy link
7343 2018-10-19 22:49:01 I’m gonna go with a strong no. Completely cut off 1 of 2 allies we have in the Middle East, lose our biggest oil importer in the world because a bad guy was killed by other bad guys? Common sense.
7344 2018-10-19 22:49:00 Chef Ramses cut up some worms, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a dictionary, along with cheese.
7345 2018-10-19 22:48:54 One day soon, the oil will run dry. The upper hand will become the begging hand.
7346 2018-10-19 22:48:53 ねうまふかわいいよおおお！！
7347 2018-10-19 22:48:47 Have you ever considered CBD Oil? A lot of our followers benefit from taking CBD for anxiety.
7348 2018-10-19 22:48:42 to trip on cbd oil, first you're gonna want to apply it to the bottoms of your feet, and then run across the linolium

7350 2018-10-19 22:48:30 My man I will gladly help you start carrying some of this water if you can give me some of that blood stained oil guap
7351 2018-10-19 22:48:26 We need more Americans uniting together to protect the Environment, Air & Water and get people on board to make changes to reduce #climatechange We have to first defeat ignorance & oil corporate lies
7352 2018-10-19 22:48:18 A can of oil once told me when they think they’re slicker than you, let em slide.

7354 2018-10-19 22:47:42 *Evening Primrose Oil For PMS Update*

This current cycle I didn’t take EPO & I got my “week before my period” cramps all last night & I’m highly emotional. 

Also, I didn’t mention this last time, but it’s for overall women’s health & hormone balance.
7355 2018-10-19 22:47:40 Between the BP oil spill in the Gulf and this stupid red tide from agricultural and septic tank runoff, Florida's coastlines are taking a beating.
7356 2018-10-19 22:47:33 There goes oil prices
7357 2018-10-19 22:47:26 that's why England puts most of it through English ports, right? Bit like the oil being 'british' 
7358 2018-10-19 22:47:15 The Saudis are fucked up. We wouldn't need them as allies in the perfect world, but the world can be a cruel place. We need their oil and they need our arms deal. Would rather be allied with them in that region compared to them being allied with Russia or China.
7359 2018-10-19 22:47:14 ちょあああ……
7360 2018-10-19 22:47:03 Your hair looks greasy. Can we get oil from there.
7361 2018-10-19 22:46:48 Oil of cloves, put it on a cotton ball and press gently. Hope you get it sorted soon. Toothache is horrible x
7362 2018-10-19 22:46:44 Saudi bought time and cover, yet at best still watery and flimsy... Poorly planned, executed and handled. 
Ridiculously shameful. 
The world needs to issue an extremely stern statement. 
Will be intriguing to know if Saudi will fight back - oil prices hitting the roofs.
7363 2018-10-19 22:46:20 If we get going there will be lots of jobs not tied to oil
7364 2018-10-19 22:46:19 Seriously folks, Saudi Arabia's government sucks. By far the most oppressive to women and LGBT communities, ran by an absolute monarchy with a ton of oil money. I tell ya, in apples to apples comparisons, we have far more in common with Iran, politically and culturally.
7365 2018-10-19 22:46:04 The propaganda project seems to have worked for you, Raoul. Don’t you remember those times? Or are you too young and read it from books. Life in the Soviet Union was not a pleasant place to be. Even today, their economy is over reliant on oil & gas production and inefficient.
7366 2018-10-19 22:45:59 Oil Money and corruption at the heart of government. The Man Knew Too Much so they took him out it was a fight between 18 man and 1 man you can fool the people sometimes but you can't fool them all the time
7367 2018-10-19 22:45:58 can't wait   add  oil  haha
7368 2018-10-19 22:45:39 I saw a Steve Schmidt. He was right, we don't need them. North America is energy sufficient, we don't need their oil. They have nothing else.
7369 2018-10-19 22:45:31 need more tea tree oil
7370 2018-10-19 22:45:27 As I have said for many years throughout this land, we’re borrowing money from China to buy oil from the Persian Gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization. Every bit of that has to change. -Al Gore-
7371 2018-10-19 22:45:25 I guess @SecretaryZinke thought it was ok for taxpayers to pay the tab on his trips to oil & mining companies so they could sign off on our park/public lands.
7372 2018-10-19 22:45:04 We don’t need anyone’s oil. We’re the leading country of energy now. Their wells have gone dry. They’ll now have to buy it from us and/or Israel. Doesn’t God Almighty work in miraculous ways when we act and move according to His ways and not our own ways! 
7373 2018-10-19 22:44:44 Implication is simple-#KhashoggiMurder shows how barbaric Arabs are & no matter how much oil money-nothing changes. Arabs need to learn to respect human rights & international laws #KingSalman needs to clean house
7374 2018-10-19 22:44:43 Just took my first dose of CBD oil. When do I start tripping?
7375 2018-10-19 22:44:30 We will keep it legal along with finally getting pipelines built the cash cow from weed will be to much to turn away. Warren buffet “you need many revenue streams” pot is just another one now if we could get our oil out wow

7377 2018-10-19 22:44:13 Apply almond oil around the mouth to keep your lips supple and soften the lines.
7378 2018-10-19 22:44:12 I need there to be a mahogany teakwood essential oil for my diffuser.
7379 2018-10-19 22:43:55 Which essential oil should I diffuse to forget ~her~
7380 2018-10-19 22:43:49 There seems to be a lot of bargaining going on here. Erdogan has some leverage that no doubt he is using to extract something from MBS. Ultimately this will all go away and Saudi will use its oil power to resume life as normal #pnpcbc
7381 2018-10-19 22:43:45 Again, do you live near a well? Why do you feel like CO residents who have to deal with the impacts of your air and water pollution don't matter? Who do you represent, people or the oil and gas industry?
7382 2018-10-19 22:43:41 forget it, Trudeau kept allowing the purchase of Saudi oil after they previous mess with Saudis. Trudeau needs the Saudi oil to cut off Alberta and Sask.
7383 2018-10-19 22:43:35 Crude oil esta tradeando a 50% de descuento
7384 2018-10-19 22:43:30 Capsaicin and clove oil can be pain killing.  I would think that mj would really be grown because it’s easy to render in oil and has great benefits for killing bacteria, cancer, skin benefits and more
7385 2018-10-19 22:43:27 rationale x oil & water 
is such a beautiful song omg 
7386 2018-10-19 22:43:24 Willing to start the bidding at $100 + an oil change for Kirk’s van to make this happen.
7387 2018-10-19 22:43:20 That is timin for sure.  I think we should come down on saudis hard.  But as soon as we do and oil spikes and market takes a hit, dems will use those two facts to bash trumps economic policies. Knowing full well the real reasons.

7391 2018-10-19 22:42:57 My gut feeling is that it's one part greed (for Iranian oil and business) and one-part total ignorance...the latter being the most dangerous. Am thankful to have you as a friend.
7392 2018-10-19 22:42:55 But what about people living in desserts or cold climates? You need oil to transport vegetables there. You need hormones and preservatives to keep food from spoiling till it gets there - u need enough to feed them all. Good luck with that.
7393 2018-10-19 22:42:55 Kan kan,yesterday I used water, a leave in conditioner, and coconut oil! My hair turned out tawab, thawadah sis
7394 2018-10-19 22:42:42 With oil while you sip Ribena with a straw.
7395 2018-10-19 22:42:41 This is so true
7396 2018-10-19 22:42:36 Nobody told me that Jack Daniels honey was so damn good  that’s the only alcohol that don’t taste like death and motor oil to me
7397 2018-10-19 22:42:17 "My Job is more Important than your health" Selfish words of our oil and gas friends
7398 2018-10-19 22:42:13 Saudi’s are dirty... they hold half of our trillions in debt. We need to use solar power funded by non-Saudi oil money to get away from these bad people.
7399 2018-10-19 22:42:12 Canada has 0.005% of the world’s population. Which is why a carbon tax on us will have no effect on GLOBAL emissions. It’s all about the math. To get the world off oil we need solutions that work on a global scale, and not throw economies into chaos by just stopping oil overnight
7400 2018-10-19 22:42:03 Remember when Saudi Arabia sent 15 people to kill almost 3000 Americans and we then retaliated by bombing Iraq?

Yeah, I don’t see the US pulling their noses out of Saudi Arabia’s anus any time soon. 

C̶o̶c̶a̶i̶n̶e̶ Oil is a helluva drug.

7402 2018-10-19 22:41:44 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
7403 2018-10-19 22:41:38 Yes!! I put oil on Emmalyn before bed every night. But I’m positive that using oils doesn’t make you magically healthier 
7404 2018-10-19 22:41:38 @DavidMuir Got back Close2 6PM. Needed an oil change, was almost a year since one. Made several other stops also. Mo's still messing over my car. Air Condition blowing out warm air. On the way back from the shop I experienced some cold/cool air. He's envious. Nothing nice2say@him
7405 2018-10-19 22:41:36 Time to tame the oil king once threaten to flood the world population with black oil if action taken against their inhuman man slaughter of their own citizen in consulate.
7406 2018-10-19 22:41:34 Tell them... 
Las las one of their family member pass through here...
7407 2018-10-19 22:41:29 I need y’all to understand a C300 is the base model for Mercedes  be humble and know you about to spend well over $150 for a oil change
7408 2018-10-19 22:41:19 Yes they do. Should always be an option for them. Can’t imagine the hell they go through. Oil would help with the body, mind and soul.

7411 2018-10-19 22:41:07 Perhaps you need earwax cleaned out either by doctor, two drops olive oil each night per ear before bed, cotton wool to prevent run off then nurse/doctor washout ear with warm water. Sounds like an express train running through you head!  Consult doctor. 1/2
7412 2018-10-19 22:41:06 We all just to need it go at present 

Russia still going to BUS FEST 
Russia happily send them Arms 

Oil until 15/20 years time we reliant 
Imagine Russia /Saudi Alliance
7413 2018-10-19 22:40:56 Indeed. Why is the idea that oil companies should be accountable for past contributions to climate change "silly"? Because we all consume fossil fuels? 

If fossil fuel (& tobacco!) companies hadn't pushed fake "science" for decades, against the public interest, I might buy that.

7418 2018-10-19 22:40:06 Olaplex? Or another alternative, I used to cover my hair in coconut oil and only then bleach it. It sort of coats the hair and shields it from getting damaged (although im sure it still does, to some extent) but it would leave it soft and not dry after dying!
7419 2018-10-19 22:40:01 Saudis need to be sanctioned to the max.  All aide cut off.  Stop buying oil from them.  They suck
7420 2018-10-19 22:39:53 what made the wise virgins wise was because they understand they needed extra oil.
Many Christians don't see the need to refuel.

7423 2018-10-19 22:39:18 where were in 2013, 2014 and 2015 when the country has it oil boom and we borrowed that much sir, why now sir?
7424 2018-10-19 22:39:10 It's all a farce to manipulate oil, Win-win for US and Saudi if this escalates
7425 2018-10-19 22:38:56 unhealthy and fattening in large quantities and most processed foods are processed with soybean oil and use soy as a substitute for fillers

7428 2018-10-19 22:38:24 It's not fake news that Mr. Kashoggi, a guest in our country, was murdered in Turkey by the Saudi King's men on the King's orders. You would sell America's honor for gun money and oil. Shame on you.
7429 2018-10-19 22:38:19 If it's not 100% organic, NO soy/edamame/soybean oil, All grass-fed-Only beef, 100% antibiotic free meats/chicken/eggs of all kinds TOO, why bother?
I can get all this for way less than $7.49/serving (actually in the range of $5.00/ serving), so tell me why I should subscribe?
7430 2018-10-19 22:38:11 We certainly can find other places to buy oil from.

7434 2018-10-19 22:37:29 David, thanks for your article. I can't figure out why the arms deal is so important to US future. Why not talk abt Saudi oil? I'd think day-to-day reality is we need their oil more than their money. Yet no one mentions oil.
7435 2018-10-19 22:37:26 dont worry, Trudeau will still allow the purchase of their oil.
7436 2018-10-19 22:37:15 The place so cold, my coconut oil not thawing out man.

7442 2018-10-19 22:36:49 Well, they've been screwing us with the price of oil for 50 years so....
7443 2018-10-19 22:36:42 also! probiotics work wonderfully, especially since you're not eating oil or sugar (i don't recommend cutting out food groups completely though)
7444 2018-10-19 22:36:37 Yep! Get ready for the BIG lie about oil!

7448 2018-10-19 22:36:12 super super high amount of biotin + conditioner or oil a lot, my mare get really dry/cracked/chipping hooves in the summer and I have to condition twice a day just to keep them from cracking. biotin takes a while to work though
7449 2018-10-19 22:36:04 What’s the worst that can happen if we all decide to work on ways to slow it? We’d lose some jobs in oil but add jobs in clean renewable energy. We’d have cleaner air and water. We wouldn’t need Middle East for oil. 
What’s the worst if you’re wrong? Good bye world.
7450 2018-10-19 22:35:54 I’ve been outta CBD oil all week & my anxiety is through the roof. I might’ve been crying sitting in traffic today

7452 2018-10-19 22:35:43 Today I officially turned over to the adult life... my dad asked what I wanted for my birthday since he didn’t get me anything yet and I said my car needs an oil change... so what did I get from my dad? An oil change.
7453 2018-10-19 22:35:37 that would hurt Canadian workers more than the Saudis. The only thing that will hurt them is to stop pirchasing oil.
7454 2018-10-19 22:35:22 The thing is you can't drag ABU, it'll come back to haunt you because either your father, mother, uncle, siblings, aunty, cousins, nephew, niece, lecturer, governor, president, vice president, IG, VC, Boss, manager Were Abusites, or connected in one way or the other

7455 2018-10-19 22:35:16 As a blue collar American, I’m sickened by people not supporting Trump.. oil field booming, construction booming, refineries booming, ECONOMY booming, jobs up & unemployment & debt down, borders improved, international trade agreements renegotiated to HELP THE USA #DontTreadOnMe
7456 2018-10-19 22:35:14 How are drivers saving that? If your answer is by cutting the gas tax, up here in NW Ontario the price hasn't dropped and it's the oil companies pocketing the extra profit. We need legislation to force the price drops to be passed along to the consumer. We are being gouged!
7457 2018-10-19 22:35:13 Humans contain nine pints of blood, and cars nine pints of oil. Coincidence?

7463 2018-10-19 22:34:51 My car had no oil in it. Great.
7464 2018-10-19 22:34:45 Oil Politics and Power: Now Saudia is extending Olive Arm towards arch rival Iran to face incoming sanctions. Trump policies lead to higher oil prices, this is what America, neocons, warlords, and arms lords wanted.
7465 2018-10-19 22:34:42 And it started its life in a can in oil...
7466 2018-10-19 22:34:32 Decided my bff and I are going to be a goldfish and rainbow fish for Halloween. 

Gonna make my boyf be an oil spill bc men are toxic waste. 
7467 2018-10-19 22:34:30 weak talk, then they allow more oil to be purchased.
7468 2018-10-19 22:34:29 5) We import oil as well. If we stopped all oil production today, do you expect us not to buy any from other countries?? 6) By stopping production it would still not reduce the use of oil worldwide. We don’t have that much clout on a global scale.

7473 2018-10-19 22:33:48 I mean how can a person actually be morally ok voting Democrat if they are anti-war or pro environment since they are neither of those things. Sure they believe in climate change but they sure do like taking money from big oil and being pro fracking.
7474 2018-10-19 22:33:47 They're sheep. The minute Trump gets indicted, another snake oil salesman will convince them to vote against their own interests.

7477 2018-10-19 22:33:14 You're anti-people, pro-corp, anti-health, anti-woman & pro-rape. You scream for oil even as its use destroys the planet. @NRA gives you A+ & rubles from oligarchs. All this means you're pro-foreign powers & against American people. You're a traitor. Why would anyone vote 4u?
7478 2018-10-19 22:33:13 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.

7488 2018-10-19 22:32:33 We are essentially already doing so by developing LNG &  oil that will command a global price by getting it to tidal waters. The Chinese are using solar etc as they see the writing on the wall & the true cost of 'smog days' due to pollution (both politically & environmentally)
7489 2018-10-19 22:32:33 Yeah the soap still contains oil molecules and stuff from the food so you gotta
7490 2018-10-19 22:32:23 This is why God has given them so much oil, to compensate for their extreme stupidity
7491 2018-10-19 22:32:20 Every administration has been complicit with the House of Saud because of oil.  But it needs to stop. Instead of pointing fingers at history, why not be the administration that ends our complicity.
7492 2018-10-19 22:32:11 Yup, I can see what a threat he must have been with just needing to get the necessary forms to get married.  This is INSULTING and it's time to stop treating them as allies.  They are just ISIS with oil.
7493 2018-10-19 22:32:06 Good thing they have oil, because they are dumb as dirt

7497 2018-10-19 22:31:46 I am trying. They charge me extra if the oil is poor quality. So any filthy oil changes end up in a mixed barrel for standard recycling *fuelles container ships*

7507 2018-10-19 22:30:05 You used vegetable oil to grow your beard?
7508 2018-10-19 22:30:05 1) Alberta is not the only oil producing province. 2) Canada is no where near the top of oil producing countries. 3) Oil is not only used for personal vehicles. 4) The majority of oil we produce goes to the US, which has REDUCED their GHG so do we get to subtract from ours??

7510 2018-10-19 22:29:48 The Saudi Muslims are invested in Fox News, just as they bought the Trump family. We give weapons and oil sales to the people who fund Islamic study centers (which our CIA and FBI call terror threats!). While they divide our country.
7511 2018-10-19 22:29:39 Exactly, oil won't last forever, just like coal didn't. It's time to look into the future and start building the new roads now! Vote @BetoORourke

Who values the oil and investment more than a life?
7534 2018-10-19 22:26:06 Maybe Ben Nimmo pulled a couple of all nighters so he could "analyze" 10 million tweets.
If a Russian expresses an opinion they are a bot (all connected to the govt of course) If a non-Russian expressess opinion that doesn't want to boil Putin in oil they are Kremlin trolls.
7535 2018-10-19 22:26:02 Just cut support for the Saudi's and they lose what happens after that.
What fate will the Iranians force on Saudi.
We may end up with at the very best a heavily Iranian influenced Saudi.
Then who has influence over their oil and who does that benefit.
7536 2018-10-19 22:25:44 I like the oil put it under ur tounge it huts ur nervous system faster

7538 2018-10-19 22:25:36 30% of that money should go to Kwale people following the Turkana oil formula. Only then will investors stay safe.

7546 2018-10-19 22:24:40 @LaBeautyologist hey girl, can I use coconut oil as a make up remover?  is that safe or issa big no ?
7547 2018-10-19 22:24:33 according to wikipedia you‘re right. He was just the one who had poured gas and oil on it......
7548 2018-10-19 22:24:29 I come from a family of Republicans. They live by Reagan’s 11th Commandment: never speak ill of another @GOP   That’s why Trump has them so spellbound.  He’s snake oil, they are carnival-goers.  When #Bif goes to jail it will be over.   #Basta
7549 2018-10-19 22:24:28 It took two weeks to come up with... "a fight broke out". 

Fuck me. 

Just shows, all the oil, gold plated Mercedes and fake royal titles, doesn't buy you a fucking pair of brain cells.
7550 2018-10-19 22:24:21 If oil spiked now the global economy would crash.
7551 2018-10-19 22:24:20 Lets see if Trudeau and Freeland will ban the purchase of Saudi oil now.
7552 2018-10-19 22:24:09 yep...maybe they have a lot of oil customers...
7553 2018-10-19 22:24:04 Does the vape pen still count if its got THC oil in it instead of whatever the fuck ejuice is? If so then I'm at 33% of these (and I'm not saying what the other one is but it isn't dad's credit card, a fedora, a fixie or Crocs...).
7554 2018-10-19 22:23:43 One of the first things I do on any character is to go out and get a bag of ball bearings, 60 ft of rope, 10 ft pole, some oil, and a 1 or 2 pound bag of flour.

Flour is crazy useful, especially for revealing invisible but not immaterial creatures.
7555 2018-10-19 22:23:29 The honey thyme glaze I made for the baked salmon last night turned out well, must remember again for next time.. honey+thyme+dill+white vinegar+olive oil+garlic
7556 2018-10-19 22:23:28 I checked my spam folder to look for prop day tickets and all I found was emails for weiner pills & CBD oil.
7557 2018-10-19 22:23:23 You know you’re an adult when new tires and an oil change excites you lol
7558 2018-10-19 22:23:11 We know Trudeau's response will be cowardly and keep allowing Canada to buy Saudi oil.
7559 2018-10-19 22:23:08 Due to spiking global oil prices coupled with weak peso performance, this fare hike is inevitable since there's no plan to suspend TRAIN ONE's fuel excise tax. We import about 90% of our fuel requirements. Suspending that excise tax will significantly dampen inflation rise.
7560 2018-10-19 22:22:56 My car still needs an oil change & I just need to kill myself.
7561 2018-10-19 22:22:41 Just got my heating oil bill and I'm ready to make the switch to indoor barrel fires.
7562 2018-10-19 22:22:40 Where do they buy cooking oil?
7563 2018-10-19 22:22:38 Am at home..  So get another excuse
7564 2018-10-19 22:22:31 Now Playing LIVE Midnight Oil - Beds Are Burning presented by Radio Airwaves
7565 2018-10-19 22:22:29 Almond oil, macadamia oil, coconut oil
7566 2018-10-19 22:22:26 Yes, definitely. They want to be the new Texas oil barons.
7567 2018-10-19 22:22:06 I actually think my local cannabis shop uses this platform. (Located in Colorado)  It's where we get our Dog's CBD oil for his arthritis.  BTW I think the pet CBD market could be huge.  It's worked magic for our dog - less $ - and less harmful to the dog.
7568 2018-10-19 22:21:50 @SenMajLdr @HouseGOP 
A man has been brutally murdered by an "ally" that you want to sell weapons to and get oil from after you trash Iran. Trump knows the truth. Jared likely does too. And so do you. How much blood are you willing to have on your hands?
7569 2018-10-19 22:21:30 But hey, oil prices remain steady!
7570 2018-10-19 22:21:30 I have a prescription for oil.
7571 2018-10-19 22:21:29 When you're using your futmite slow WiFi how will it load properly 
7572 2018-10-19 22:21:25 Ever experimented with oil pulling? I've tried it a few times before, has seemed to make some difference if I stuck with it for a while daily.
7573 2018-10-19 22:21:21 Good... looky at them oil tanks surrounding the area... it looks like it would've been bad if it spread thataways
7574 2018-10-19 22:21:19 When I look at what Arab countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar , are doing with their oil money , then I begin to wonder if it’s groundnut oil Nigeria is selling 
7575 2018-10-19 22:21:14 オリーブ油で毎日を楽しく(*^_^*)
7576 2018-10-19 22:21:13 Justice means nothing to him.  He's all about his rich oil buddies and he serves them and many of them are not even Canadian.
7577 2018-10-19 22:21:10 Mayo contains oils and those make stuff go down easier.   There is a slight discomfort to eating that oil removes.
7578 2018-10-19 22:21:07 Oil price is back up - less pressure to change - more danger in the interim
7579 2018-10-19 22:21:07 All the avocado and fish oil can’t save meeee
7580 2018-10-19 22:21:04 How I wish oil was never discovered in Nigeria maybe we would have been depending Agriculture and Mining whic I believe it creates more Employment. ...
7581 2018-10-19 22:21:03 Have you tried a quality CBD oil yet?
7582 2018-10-19 22:20:55 And don’t forget the Kuwaitis gave the Bush’s an oil field.  Clinton funneled millions through their foundation from the Saudis
7583 2018-10-19 22:20:54 groundnut oil
7584 2018-10-19 22:20:46 Its because you pretend not to see, here is a bit of the V11s,...Khupe getting 40k out of close to 6 million votes,Army killing civillians, Cholera Outbreak soon after elections,The downtrodden healthcare you just spoke aboutNo fuel, no sigar, no cooking oil,no investors, etc etc
7585 2018-10-19 22:20:25 Shop around dude, look for deals on oil changes. Tires i go to discount tire but also look online.
7586 2018-10-19 22:20:18 Ended up going to the mechanic to get an oil change and tire rotation . And now I'm looking at a 1-2 hour wait 
7587 2018-10-19 22:20:11 just takes the norm from repubs..lies  putin  preachers selling jesus tax free for profit backing them..abortion blamed on Dems by repubs who rally do not care. great con men like trumpnazi and mostly money from oil and big pharm etc. Blue is coming in November .
7588 2018-10-19 22:20:10 You are such an amazing human! Please help reptiles get their insurance! Insurance is important because it is something that it can be very useful. I was wondering, corn oil is made from corn, and vegetable oil is made from vegetables. So, what is baby oil made from?
7589 2018-10-19 22:19:58 Jesus was just a man w marijuana oil, which cured the sick and everyone thought he was miraculous.
7590 2018-10-19 22:19:56 We already have plenty of laws that could be enforced to deal with this situation in numerous regards. Obviously the laws are not being followed or enforced. More laws isn’t the answer.

7602 2018-10-19 22:18:28 Luis gets home rushes to my room and hands my a joint rolled with oil and covered in kief like "lmk how that hits" say noooooo more my guyyyy!
7603 2018-10-19 22:18:24 @WhiteHouse @ENERGY @USDOT @USDOL Thanks ! IMO @POTUS must ask US Oil Lobby & #OPEC : With so much Oil around, why is gallon still at $3 ? Season is over & Oil still Up ? Tankers are flush , pipes to explode but the gallon still at $2.99 ? Someone is colluding big time , shame !
7604 2018-10-19 22:18:09 My mom seriously compared smoking and vaping . And asked Matt “what is she like when she’s on this stuff”, meaning CBD oil . Lord have mercy this woman 
7605 2018-10-19 22:18:01 I need an oil change I be forgetttttinnnnnn 
7606 2018-10-19 22:18:00 I’m getting my oil changed and one of the workers let a car that got here after me into a bay and I was like no big deal I don’t have anywhere to rush to and he comes up 5 minutes after they start dudes oil change and said they’re gonna knock $10 off for the wait. Hell yeah.
7607 2018-10-19 22:17:57 
7608 2018-10-19 22:17:50 tbh tea tree oil works different for everyone , it always makes me even more dry
7609 2018-10-19 22:17:45 someone pls bring me some kind of essential oil
7610 2018-10-19 22:17:37 Oh no, a well known reporter died in a fight. Quick, lets slice him up, stuff him in an oil barrel and drop him in the Bosphorus!
7611 2018-10-19 22:17:36 Best you start heating up oil to fry some yourself
7612 2018-10-19 22:17:29 @misskellystrait omg i have CRPS have had it for 21 yrs have 2 neuro stims and use CBD oil
7613 2018-10-19 22:17:02 Saturated fats are also found in a few vegetable oils, such as palm oil, coconut oil, hydrogenated oils, and chocolate. #HeartHealth
7614 2018-10-19 22:16:58 This oil diffuser was the best thing I ever bought 
7615 2018-10-19 22:16:55 Talking football with random people while waiting on my oil change. #midwestern
7616 2018-10-19 22:16:52 Believe the memes! Jet-fuel can’t melt steel beams! Our tax money is used to buy fancy appetizers for political parties! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
7617 2018-10-19 22:16:35 Genuine Principals? Such as what? Concern for Human Rights or control of Regional Oil fields and territories?
7618 2018-10-19 22:16:26 I didn’t have any til i had him & i used coconut oil on my stomach everyday my stomach was so pretty
7619 2018-10-19 22:16:21 The term furbaby weirds me out.
7620 2018-10-19 22:16:12 Go back to Agriculture, go back to recycling of products. no over reliance on oil. we import cow, goat, turkey, chicken, tomato, rice, etc and we boast of 200m citizens who are lazy and looking for white collar jobs.
7621 2018-10-19 22:16:11 Essayez CDB Oil sans THC.
7622 2018-10-19 22:16:09 Actually, it will cost you more than it will bring in. If you dont need it dont do it. They will cost the state on average $100,000/ ft to do tge project based on the gas and oil pipeline costs. @mngop @mnhouseDFL @mnhousegop @tomemmer @AngieCraigMN
7623 2018-10-19 22:16:00 More CBD oil 
7624 2018-10-19 22:15:32 We will get you Saudi Arabia when we impeach Drumpf! Binary genders will rain down upon bad oil people! Orange man is bad! #bluewave
7625 2018-10-19 22:15:27 加油! “add oil” finally in the English dictionary! Brilliant.
7626 2018-10-19 22:15:27 Hey, fish is always done before chicken so the oil is not the same and it’s changed regularly as well soooo everyone can enjoy their filets in peace

7628 2018-10-19 22:15:16 When it comes to the survival of entire species, you're right. I won't be satisfied by anything less than absolute certainty that they won't be killing ecosystems just for profit's sake. I remember those things as well. Oil isn't alternative energy. One other thing....1/
7629 2018-10-19 22:15:13 That doesn't pass the giggle test.  I say we embargo all Saudi oil and bar them from the US Financial system unless MbS faces a US trial and sits for an 'Ole Sparky audition.
7630 2018-10-19 22:15:13 Skincare Twitter can someone please recommend a great oil free moisturizer. I have been using Kate Somerville for a while now and I really want to change.
7631 2018-10-19 22:15:10 Norway has massive oil reserves. They pump a lot of crude, much of it from offshore drilling...not that there's anything wrong with that. Canada sells a lot of oil, too. Canada and Norway thrive under U.S. (super expensive) nuclear umbrella. We can all get along and do biz.
7632 2018-10-19 22:15:09 My paw paw changed the oil in my car, changed my air filters, and put air in my tires..  Love ain’t the worddd.....
7633 2018-10-19 22:15:07 Getting my oil changed is an accomplishment for me

2. Yes the pharmaceutical industry corporations are greedy bastards who over charge for medicines.  They are researching and have developed tons of new treatments...
7637 2018-10-19 22:14:52 If he loved Putin so much why did he condemn the oil deal Germany was doing with Russia.
7638 2018-10-19 22:14:48 Has Trump claimed Khashoggi was accidentally killed, dismembered, stuffed into an oil drum and thrown in the Bosporus yet?
7639 2018-10-19 22:14:47 Correct. New Cold War (US v China) in the offing.

7642 2018-10-19 22:14:20 It all comes down to oil.
7643 2018-10-19 22:14:18 Can't someone come up with a CoQ10 fish oil capsule that isn't as big as a semi truck? These buggers are too hard to get down my gullet.
Guess I have to make pancakes now. Cuz....you know. Pancakes.
7644 2018-10-19 22:14:17 I hate auto maintenance. So much money man  I'm going to need new tires soon. Oil change and tires rotated. 
7645 2018-10-19 22:14:16 Agreed. Which is why I’m vegan & also try to avoid things like palm oil. Plus I don’t fly. Eating animal products isn’t the only way we are destroying our planet. But it’s one of the mayor ones & all recent research shows going plant based reduces our carbon footprint massively!
7646 2018-10-19 22:14:13 Say word you hop on that thc oil ?
7647 2018-10-19 22:14:12 My hair is greasy bc I forgot dry shampoo but I’m cold so i can’t put it in a ponytail to hide the oil :/
7648 2018-10-19 22:13:46 For me, no not really. For the country and ppl following this rain maker, yea
7649 2018-10-19 22:13:27 And palm oil in all of them?
7650 2018-10-19 22:13:25 Much of it comes from Indonesia and Malaysia. Rain forests are cleared for palm oil plantations. Habitat for orangutans, elephants, rhinos etc is disappearing.

7655 2018-10-19 22:12:57 Bio oil worked wonders in my scars, they’re not acne scars but from what I’ve heard it works the same. It pretty pricey but you can get some pretty good own brand versions cheaper
7656 2018-10-19 22:12:53 I didn't see this earlier..
7657 2018-10-19 22:12:41 nothing is new w me. a house centipede crawled out of a crack in my kitchen and i doused that corner in tea tree oil like a dumbass

My point was:  Two 'real men' at the range finishing up on some CQB drills.
Sam and Terry.
"whatcha doing after this, Sam?"
Terry responds. "Changing the oil in my truck.  You?" 
"Headed home, have a date with the wife and she wants to cave my ass in"

7659 2018-10-19 22:12:23 Oil/gas prices are fairly correlated with economic performance, because it's a major input to our economy!
7660 2018-10-19 22:12:20 Hmm... thin crust dough has milk and a little sugar in the crust. I'm gonna try honey and a little olive oil instead of sugar. 
7661 2018-10-19 22:12:15 I should probably make some green chili tonight. Coat my hands in pepper oil for eye gouging in rugby tomorrow

7664 2018-10-19 22:11:48 Thanks ! Restaurants ,Department Stores & Shopping Centers are vital for USA Economy, that's why @POTUS should ask #OPEC & Oil Industry in USA why gallon is at $3 when is so much Oil ? Higher Oil Prices forces People & Families to cut on Restaurants, shopping,etc. Why $3 gallon?
7665 2018-10-19 22:11:47 9.5 million in Honduras alone. Exactly how many do we take? 1 million each from Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador,  Nicaragua, Venezuela ect? You don't worry for your children's future by taking in this many Ill equipped to compete in tomorrows econ?

7668 2018-10-19 22:11:28 Cant believe how tweed just told me the the oil i used to order for my pain is no longer available they r to busy now selling to the public. Instead of helping someone with pain
7669 2018-10-19 22:11:20 That's largely a myth that oil company PR spreads in DC. Widespread economic circumstances are much more important than gas prices.
7670 2018-10-19 22:11:06 Uhhhhhhh... ok. The problem was that Venezuela’s government assumed it could sustain itself on oil. So it nationalized industries and regulated based on this assumption. Turns out that government isn’t as adaptable as the free market, so Venezuela’s economy failed.
7671 2018-10-19 22:11:06 Bio oil baths are my favourite 
7672 2018-10-19 22:10:46 Is it? So that demand can be met by countries that make no effort at all to reduce the carbon-intensity of their heavy crude oil? Sure, that makes sense.
7673 2018-10-19 22:10:44 Trump isn't spineless, he is clueless. If he sanctions SA, they cut oil production. Since he already sanctioned Iran, there is no country that can make up the deficit. Don't play checkers with people playing chess. You win BIGLY!
7674 2018-10-19 22:10:43 You can also use raw coconut oil. It has antimicrobial and antibacterial properties that help protect vaginal health. My Gyn told me about it. She told me that doctors don’t recommend it because they want to keep those dollars rolling in. But it’s amazing.
7675 2018-10-19 22:10:21 as a migraine sufferer, the benefits of peppermint oil could actually make me cry. this relief is amazing 
7676 2018-10-19 22:10:14 What about the global oil price contraction that began in 2014/15 Obviously you were not in #Alberta, when 200K + workers were laid off. 

Are you saying this did not effect gov revenues. Also what about EI extensions? AB families also made it due to an increase in #CCB payments

7679 2018-10-19 22:09:57 If you're in market for a new or good used vehicle, you might want to think about a hybrid model or electric car. The present situation with the big oil producer in ME,OPEC prices will be going up. So prepare for it. More people own cars in world,so demand is up. Supply & demand.
7680 2018-10-19 22:09:56 I’ve heard they wear cowboy hats and there’s lots of oil

So literally Texas
7681 2018-10-19 22:09:41 Wage growth will never keep pace with asset inflation(land, oil, gold, real estate). The latter is the result of wasteful government deficit spending and an intentional effort to pay government debt with cheaper dollars. It’s a Democrat con game the wage earner can never win
7682 2018-10-19 22:09:40 I doused my hair in coconut oil before I showered last night because it’s broken as frick and today it’s SILK omg someone play with my hair immediately
7683 2018-10-19 22:09:31 They never paid for 9/11 either. Instead we attacked Iraq. Same answer - money and oil.

7688 2018-10-19 22:08:08 Have you read “Killers of the Flower Moon” by David Grann? It is about the Osage Indians in Oklahoma, how they were cheated, and killed for their oil rights. Birth of the FBI. Devastating.

7690 2018-10-19 22:07:33 You're worried.
7691 2018-10-19 22:07:24 The oil and gas industry doesn’t poison the water, it’s what NM needs to help grow economically and to halt it from being a complete shit hole that the liberals in Santa Fe have made it by crippling its economy. #NMTRUE
7692 2018-10-19 22:07:15 Obama admin punished them by reducing oil to $30, while trump took out 3rd largest supplier iran to take oil at $80, biggest gainers are Russians
7693 2018-10-19 22:07:12 I swear the owner or founder of @Tesla will be the richest person on the planet for more than a decade if the world should runs out of crude oil.
7694 2018-10-19 22:07:05 Are you sure you used 9months in the womb and you took your mum's breast milk for at least 9 month's if so you would not have tweet shits, please goan grow well there is not short cut to growth it like oil no matter how much water you pour it would show.#unimedvsosustech
7695 2018-10-19 22:07:03 can someone put some hair repair oil in jeongyeon’s scalp
7696 2018-10-19 22:07:01 The amount of times jake oil has said “like” while “speaking his truth” makes me want to scream. I wish I wasn’t 8 videos & over an hour into this fucking video- can’t stop now but DAMNNNNNN GET YOUR SHIT STRAIGHT
7697 2018-10-19 22:06:53 The simple solution is to adjust our laws.
Over 17,000 came In Sept. alone and are roaming the country now. Nearly every migrant from last caravan Is still here and likely will nvr leave. 
They have phones/ internet in Honduras
7698 2018-10-19 22:06:49 Gonna be late. Oil changing right now
7699 2018-10-19 22:06:45 so russia sells oil and gas yeh? while china makes all of your technology micro chips, mobile phones and computers etc, yet you think its Russia who hacked Hillarys emails 
7700 2018-10-19 22:06:45 Hello,

I would love to take part to this training Center.
Actually, I'm an undergraduate student in Oil and Gas Production, second year.
So I'd like to get more information about the application and the criteria as soon as possible, Please.

Thanks,
7701 2018-10-19 22:06:42 Leave the oil fields so we can hang out @Pandobra can come too
7702 2018-10-19 22:05:49 MY FRIENDS AND I FINESSED FOOD FROM A BUFFET AND THE OIL WENT EVERYWHERE IN MY BACKPACK THIS IS KARMA
7703 2018-10-19 22:05:45 I got $3 blessed oil and prayer cloth sets hmu
Only available before the Mega Million is pulled 
7704 2018-10-19 22:05:44 EVs are not making a significant difference now, because there are so few. But if they become popular they will partly decouple both pocketbook issues and economic performance from world oil prices. (domestic electricity prices are already largely decoupled due to cheap gas)
7705 2018-10-19 22:05:35 Dang! Forgot I had to get my oil changed tomorrow and need someone to scoop me. Hopefully my papa ain’t got nthn to do like everybody else 
7706 2018-10-19 22:05:34 That means I even respect them small
7707 2018-10-19 22:05:13 The oil change my car got today was so needed. It literally drives like new again.
7708 2018-10-19 22:05:13 You ignored the advice of experts and listened to snake oil salesman who promised things they couldn't deliver and people will pay with their lives for your decision!

Well done Gary, well done.
7709 2018-10-19 22:05:11 New items!!! Beautiful pluggable oil diffusers and Himalayan salt lamps!!
7710 2018-10-19 22:05:09 Oh thank goodness, that means less demand for the furnace's fuel oil. Oh but shoveling the driveway ... Noooooo! lol
7711 2018-10-19 22:04:32 "purpose" so to be clear she was saying that if some folks (like rich oil executives) don't like us going towards a green energy future, that's too bad for them, but that we owe it to most Americans to make sure they're doing well.

That's what you disagree with?
7712 2018-10-19 22:04:20 Cbd oil x
7713 2018-10-19 22:04:09 Baby oil !!
7714 2018-10-19 22:03:54 I feel like there is just not even space in cherry hills for oil and gas development. Is there anywhere you could get 500 ft (almost two football fields) from any house or building? Point is obviously right but kind of an obsolete comparison.
7715 2018-10-19 22:03:41 Except for the fact that th US produces enough oil to fuel all our own cars without the Saudis don’t we? 
I do also support clean renewables.
7716 2018-10-19 22:03:34 Dad- what are you gonna do if you win the lotto?

7717 2018-10-19 22:03:30 I wash my face with banana soap everyday, use rosewater as final touch. 

Then I use coconut oil as finish after the whole cleaning.

7719 2018-10-19 22:03:28 get ya some tea tree oil
7720 2018-10-19 22:03:27 #UnitedKingdom & #America, for over 70 years have sought the oil and money of #SaudiArabia. Now that  #Khashoggi is dead & Yemen devastated, they are both seeking to replace one prince (#MBS) with another to carry on with business. This is an absolute kingdom. An absolute shame.
7721 2018-10-19 22:03:25 Maybe if just pretend and let the oil companies raise the gas prices to 15 bucks a gallon for a month or two, they'll shut up.
7722 2018-10-19 22:03:07 @conservmillen I appreciated your post about pelosi.. maybe u can respond where @benshapiro didnt. How can u guys not be critical of @realDonaldTrump when his legacy is literally dividing the U.S to extremes by spewing hatred ab oil it the left everyday. 1/2
7723 2018-10-19 22:02:55 What your saying is so true Turkey and Iran are together along with Russia they want the oil fields and to destroy the Middle East.
7724 2018-10-19 22:02:52 Oil head they shine with oil..
7725 2018-10-19 22:02:51 Nobody begged him to. He was a failed  contender of d primaries who later joined the clear winning candidate to lobby for incentives. He failed to be warned that oil doesn’t mix with water & integrity never stand wit corruption. Same way he donated charity 2015 will repeat itself
7726 2018-10-19 22:02:45 In the last couple days two groups were arrested for corruption, smuggling. Erbil #Asayish arrested a group 6 for oil smuggling, Kirkuk police arrested another group for corruption charges at newly established customs points. We will follow up on both cases and find out details.
7727 2018-10-19 22:02:42 I’ve been dipping my toe into veganism in the past few weeks, and I’ve been surprised to find quite so many vegan nazis out there. Being vegetarian can be difficult enough, being a vegan is really hard, I can do without people getting angry about coconut oil!
7728 2018-10-19 22:02:40 Their VC is not oppurtuned to have an office similar to this

7735 2018-10-19 22:01:30 I feel ya. Went shopping at olive oil store before dinner yesterday and just now realized we left it at the restaurant. And thankfully they still have it.

7749 2018-10-19 21:59:10 If my man tells me to get an oil change ONE more time I’m going to lose it 

If you drive the car, you should change the oil

And if I drive the car, you should probably just go ahead and change the oil bc I’m a 23 yr old woman tf do I look like lol
7750 2018-10-19 21:59:08 Aye? We really should be ‘tighter’ with our oil & Gas! We will though.. good discount for neighbours 
7751 2018-10-19 21:59:01 wtf I sprayed my hair w oil sheen & it curled up  !!! I jst wanted a puff today 
7752 2018-10-19 21:58:53 Wrong!

Why then do Venezuelans have no food, yet they have the largest supply of Oil in the World? The oil is owned by the government. All the profit goes tot he government for the supposed benefit of the people. Yet they are starving. They eat zoo animals & rats.
7753 2018-10-19 21:58:42 they put CBD oil in literally everything out here and I feel like it’s just an overpriced laxative half the time

7758 2018-10-19 21:57:55 Ignoring the Chinese card. These idiots are econ and foriegn policy illiterate. 
China is destined to become THE hegemonic power eventually just by sheer numbers of ppl.

7765 2018-10-19 21:57:10 While the oil patch is exploding in neighborhoods across Colorado -

Gov. John #Hickenlooper's hand-picked Oil & Gas Commission sided with industry to appeal court ruling that protects public health & environment. Time to reconsider? Or stay on #wrongsideofhistory ? @hickforco
7766 2018-10-19 21:57:09 I'm not sure I'd call it a loss, since I never saw our engagement with Muslim world as permanent. I believe end of oil in coming decades, & rise of Asian Gigapowers, China & India by mid-century, will transform E Hemisphere political scene. Not sure W has any role here post-oil.
7767 2018-10-19 21:56:56 FECO = full extract cannabis oil. The real deal, no additives. The entire idea of using cannabis is to not use laboratory products. Defeats the purpose. They also claim chemo and radiation work 
7768 2018-10-19 21:56:52 Thank you! That’s fantastic! I’m asking because I’m currently contemplating on weather or not to add in hand painted oil backgrounds into my short film. I’m debating on hand painting textures the way you have or mixing textures and painted backgrounds...

7775 2018-10-19 21:56:22 Shit show is rather complimentary for the lying spice tact avoiders and snake oil salesmen that they are
It a dictatorship
7776 2018-10-19 21:55:54 All 20 of you could hop on a bus and go to your next protest about Canada’s economy, but that would be hypocritical using things that are made of oil or use oil
7777 2018-10-19 21:55:40 I don't think he cares or anyone who doesn't have a big fat check for him.  Notice how he keeps pushing the oil and gas narrative in his tweets?  It's b/c of his bribes from that industry.
7778 2018-10-19 21:55:38 The person must be a cow
7779 2018-10-19 21:55:26 Oh my ... you seem old enough to know better.  Heaven forbid we looking into other energy sources ... because oil will be around forever right?
7780 2018-10-19 21:55:19 I was supposed to get an oil change 9000 miles ago 
7781 2018-10-19 21:55:11 Why? Because they do the hard work of studying and learning and testing new treatments to see what works, to see whats safe. You and you're snake oil salesmen just prey on the desperate.
7782 2018-10-19 21:54:57 I think i recently ordered 40 lsd tabs 10 4-aco-dmt gel tabs 10 4-aco-dmt gel tabs 30 2cb pils 1ml cannabis oil 5g mdma 2g
7783 2018-10-19 21:54:56 Republicans deny climate change not because they don’t believe in science, but because oil company lobbyists pay them off to do so. Every scientist (who doesn’t work for the oil companies) agrees it is reality.
7784 2018-10-19 21:54:40 The goverment is cunning.....by shifting the blame to the oil companies...most people will see the price increase as a result of the government putting more taxes on...its that simple.......
7785 2018-10-19 21:54:40 Shame on you, ted! U know damn well that's not his platform. But while we're on the topic, why does the nra and big oil support u? And who do u work for, again?
7786 2018-10-19 21:54:29 Don't wanna sound all wet

Thanks to my good friend @CJBlacksmith who ust to make me come to his house to help me do my uni work and help me focus

And who also helped me write my first write up on which oil is best to use to cook with thanks bruhh I owe u!!
7787 2018-10-19 21:54:24 Oh, and they only SAY they like a woman who knows anything about cars. I married the one man on the planet who actually meant it. I scared away so many guys who found out I actually knew how to change my oil myself (and more) not just take it in.
7788 2018-10-19 21:54:22 Nice one bro
7789 2018-10-19 21:54:11 This figure of 7-11m barrels, is oil in placce. Is it not?

7791 2018-10-19 21:54:05 Your snake oil has been studied repeatedly over the last 30 years. It doesn't work and it kills. But researchers at pharmaceuticals companies and universities have come up with lots of developments and cancer treatments continue to improve.
7792 2018-10-19 21:53:59 When you go straight, turn left turn right again, keep going straight oooo, continue down down, turn 360, you'll see iya kasali. Tell her you want to buy virgin lip oil. Tell her I sent you she will reduce price for you. You're welcome.

7806 2018-10-19 21:51:29 The oil hugging assholes on the right don't understand that it was REGULATIONS that got lead out of gas, and REGULATIONS that mandated seatbelts and air bags. Did the auto industry go out of business as a result? NO! So this is just corporate bullshit to avoid responsibility.
7807 2018-10-19 21:51:25 Democrats don’t take oil money?   You’re delusional.
7808 2018-10-19 21:51:03 And then there's the oil too
7809 2018-10-19 21:50:54 Back in 2001 Republican President George W Bush let Saudis off for the attack on our Country. Today @realDonaldTrump is letting them off for the murder of #Khashoggi.
I guess oil money buys our Presidents.
7810 2018-10-19 21:50:36 This guy I’ve been seeing just asked if he could check my oil and if needed go get it changed for me 
7811 2018-10-19 21:50:35 You got NOTHING but meaningless sloganeering, hollow talking points, conflating totally unrelated issues to gin up voters to vote for what? 
Besides just turning ppl against Trump, what's your proposal? Bomb Saudi Arabia, just let millions cross our border?
7812 2018-10-19 21:50:29 They are the Oil,  not the bridge.  To many bad connotations to the bridge (late, over budget, delayed, over hyped)
7813 2018-10-19 21:49:37 We were discussing the use of baby powder vs. oil to help chafing, and my sister just said, in conclusion: “Fuck, marry, kill: powder, oil, chafing.”

7819 2018-10-19 21:49:06 Considering oil prices had dropped like 20% from budget 2015 to the election, those criticisms seem unreasonable, and it seems like the Liberals should have known that something had to give in their platform. I bet they did know and chose to stick to their talking points.
7820 2018-10-19 21:49:03 Forgot to mention: mother's car at 210K and gets oil change according to SI, tires when needed. Nothing else really other than occasional fluid flush. Driven daily for short and needless errands. This was #peakBMW in every sense.
7821 2018-10-19 21:48:56 two major advances in battery technology, that’s all it needs.  Inventing and patenting them would make you richer than John Getty ever got from oil.
But the legislators ought to butt out
7822 2018-10-19 21:48:35 But u are still 80% dependent on oil, I'm happy for you on your rice Independence Sha.
7823 2018-10-19 21:48:35 But was it an unpredictable shock? Oil prices fell between mid-2014 and early 2015.
7824 2018-10-19 21:48:30 It's sad when task forces would rather see good innocent people suffer from diseases, physical & mental health disorders. A local task force closed down a store that helped ppl with CBD oil, now there's uncertainty. Please @realDonaldTrump pass the legislation legalizing CBD oil.
7825 2018-10-19 21:48:26 yall ever hear the sound of food frying in oil and feel phantom burns on your hands
7826 2018-10-19 21:48:23 You know guys, I think the best way to get back at Saudi Arabia for all the shit they have been pulling for decades is to advocate for renewable energy sources. Let’s see how fast they collapse without oil money.
7827 2018-10-19 21:48:21 Please do, as someone who became allergic to peanuts a few years ago it was the only almond butter that had the consistency of peanut butter the new stuff isn’t very appetizing when you pull it off the shelf and there’s a 1/4” of oil sitting on the top.
7828 2018-10-19 21:48:21 Wait are you not supposed to put coconut oil on your face?
7829 2018-10-19 21:48:18 That’s the ultimate, scary aspect that all the news people are dancing around. Yet, that has a high probability of being true. 
Saudi Arabia is out of oil. Geo purpose. All the US bombing flights in Iraq originated in Saudi Arabia. Israel is getting more cruel and bolder.
7830 2018-10-19 21:48:14 Are you comparing oil to bitumen?
7831 2018-10-19 21:48:13 So having followed this story as a layman, the part I am not clear on is whether Obama/Hillary would do anything different from Trump.  As in anything significantly different.  Seems that all are fine with propping up Saudi just for oil, military ties, arms sales, influence etc
7832 2018-10-19 21:48:12 I worry about the hot water leaching out some of the lemon oil. Wipe well with cold water.
7833 2018-10-19 21:48:09 Enteric Fermentation Produces More Methane Than Oil & Gas Industry and Donald Trump's Caravan of Lies, Crimes & Corruptions.
7834 2018-10-19 21:47:49 Absolute power corrupts ABSOLUTELY...Islam is Human Cancer, they HATE everyone and want world domination (Nothing more nothing less).
Islam owes USA lifetime of free oil for their conduct in 9/11, they also owe us EVERYONE who helped them here in Government !
7835 2018-10-19 21:47:45 Love ya so much Lucas Oil. You’re the best lil bro ever! Also, not even sure if you’re technically my little brother on the family tree, but like... does anyone really know besides Mamaw? 
7836 2018-10-19 21:47:41 PSA: tooth rot is one of the leading causes of aging

gingivitis is a real problem. Always brush your gums when you brush your teeth. After flossing, rinse with a coconut oil pull to disinfect any bleeding spots & wash away extra plaque. Can't live past 100 if you have bad teeth!
7837 2018-10-19 21:47:17 I’m saying we’re lucky it’s not higher. Oil taxes are issue, out in place by your democratic governors.
7838 2018-10-19 21:47:15 Soit au total plus de 24% sur l année !!
Moi qui voulait installer un gazogene sur ma voiture, pour remplacer le gaz oil 
c' est loupé !

7844 2018-10-19 21:46:25 US is self sufficient (and actually exports) oil and gas thanks to #fracking. You can #factcheck that #newsnight
7845 2018-10-19 21:46:21 Curious of your view on Canadian oil sands financials and future. Aside from likely temporary distribution constraints and future GHG limits, are the EVs real?. 

Loved "All the Devils are Here" btw.  I learned a lot, very well explained imo
7846 2018-10-19 21:46:20 @JenBriney so Texas is the biggest oil producer in the country, and our State commissioners in charge of regulating this industry is taking millions from them. One is even a CEO in the industry. How is that not corruption.

If you won't & you keep spreading these lies you're an immoral monster,& all I can do is hope you are an shitty one, because I wouldn't wish the death your snake oil can cause on anyone

7854 2018-10-19 21:45:21 Just dropped a nearly full, glass, bottle of olive oil on the floor by the stove.  What a mess.  With my wonky knees trying to clean it up seated on a walker was not easy.  Cut my finger too.
7855 2018-10-19 21:45:06 Read qur'an and cry
7856 2018-10-19 21:45:04 Sequel to "How Big Oil Conquered The World".  Both very good documentaries and worth the time.
7857 2018-10-19 21:44:58 Was a ME oil exec for years.
7858 2018-10-19 21:44:56 food magazines: DO NOT use jarred minced garlic in oil, it is the WORST and you are LAZY

also food magazines: crush garlic, add oil, and put it in a jar! you get garlic infused oil and great garlic! delicious and easy!
7859 2018-10-19 21:44:48 Sir, your statement is more oily than a well-oiled eel eating olives in a bucket of oil.
7860 2018-10-19 21:44:34 Actually, just get fcuk out of the middle east all together... Let them keep their oil and slaughter each other. And if they get a bit too rambunctious... Nuke them

7864 2018-10-19 21:44:00 And the future, just before midterms, this is going to happen.
Saudi boycot pumps up less oil. Prices rise tRump can shout Fracking is a good thing. More Jobs in ND
The asylum march breaks the border between Mexico and the US. tRump Calls in Nl Gard. People will flip at midterms
7865 2018-10-19 21:43:59 Idk what’s wrong with me but at first I read “everyone should get an oil change” and I was like jazz????

Dat is the major differenc

7872 2018-10-19 21:43:25 It's unsettling, yet erotic. I like it. Going to get a big oil painting of this and hang it up in my living room.

7876 2018-10-19 21:43:05 My dad, who we later learned was in the early stages of dementia, bought four brand new cars in less than 18 months. He'd go to get the oil change on his new car, and come home with a newer one. He was, rightly, their customer of the year.
7877 2018-10-19 21:43:03 Prior to 2014 Oil slump & 2016 to April 2017, the discrepancy between the BTA & BDC rates was N2-N5.

7880 2018-10-19 21:42:37 My abdomen is full of dirt and worn credit cards, covered in engine oil. Maybe you see why I feel nothing.
7881 2018-10-19 21:42:16 Snake oil salesman....
7882 2018-10-19 21:42:06 Nothing if your using renewable energy to make them. Answers simple u put in and you get out same as everything in this world. Reason it doesn't happen is because fossil fuel tycoons don't want it to happen until they've used all the oil they own. It's that simple
7883 2018-10-19 21:41:52 “Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for YOU are with me. Your rod and your staff, they comfort me. You set a table before me right in front of my enemies! You anoint my head with soothing oil. My cup overflows.”
7884 2018-10-19 21:41:41 "Many oil executives & the crooked politicians they donate to question IPCC climate change report."

(P.S. Russia is a major oil & gas producer. 
                     and OAN is Russian propaganda )
7885 2018-10-19 21:41:38 Why bother anyway? Genuinely think when the oil runs out that the country will rip itself apart in civil war. Authoritarianism is okay when you have no material worries. Syria had a drought and look what happened.
7886 2018-10-19 21:41:32 The bottom one, yes, but I don't think so for the first four - who bothers colorizing rust/oil stains? Click through to the giant format ones. If colorized, then my hat's off to whomever did so.
7887 2018-10-19 21:41:27 Bring back the oil derrick

7892 2018-10-19 21:41:05 My rotten native language reasoning is: like you put gasoline into car engines to make it run, so can you put oil into whatever you do to succeed. Haha it's like 頑張って Ganbatte in Japanese :)

CBD oils meant to be very beneficial, hemp oil also for vitamins, Thc for more serious illnesses

Alkaline diet meant to be very beneficial.

7932 2018-10-19 21:36:32 Do you use oil??
7933 2018-10-19 21:36:31 A blossoming facial mask, soft red, with rose petals, evening primrose oil, and exfoliating brown sugar. It comes as a smooth powder.
7934 2018-10-19 21:36:14 Absolutely. I learned that during the George W. Bush years. It’s not that they don’t believe in science, but the oil companies pay them off to deny it. Meanwhile more lives, homes, properties, and automobiles will be lost. And this will accelerate in time.
7935 2018-10-19 21:36:07 Use regularly. To clean, soak in water, brush out softener gunk, rinse in warm water, then dry & store. Can use mild dish soap if needed but oil film can also be removed by roasting again.

7947 2018-10-19 21:34:34 The West should do nothing unless agreed by the UNSC or invited in by a government.

Unfortunately, the US openly refuses to respect the UN etc.

Libya: destroyed the government

Rwanda: no oil!

7957 2018-10-19 21:33:08 im getting my oil change and they give u a free car wash and this guy is cleaning tf out of my car like wow
7958 2018-10-19 21:32:59 We Africans are just so back ward,  we have failed to develop with all the oil wells  and other mineral deposites of which whites are exploiting from us
7959 2018-10-19 21:32:19 Do you think trump trusts any of the Middle East countries? No he doesn't they care about moving oil that's it
7960 2018-10-19 21:32:13 Infowars.kom is not forbidden information. It’s fucking lies, frothing, rabid racism, and snake oil sales... Jesus. Why?
7961 2018-10-19 21:31:52 Hi Mike, if the pipeline does not occur, what do you feel is the safest method for dealing with oil transportation?
7962 2018-10-19 21:31:51 I also had a dream that the world was flooded with water via the ocean, and that water was extremely oil polluted. 

It wasn’t gonna be good. Lol
7963 2018-10-19 21:31:34 I agree with you 100% on Jimmy Carter. In fact Carter was transitioning our oil based economy to wind and water. Reagan took office and literally ripped the solar panels out of the White House.
7964 2018-10-19 21:31:28 Not true! Zimbabwe produces cooking oil but doesn't grow enough soya beans to meet demand!
7965 2018-10-19 21:31:24 Oil changes so DAMN HIGH
7966 2018-10-19 21:31:18 Formula for success: rise early, work hard, strike oil.
7967 2018-10-19 21:31:17 Esos brazos me recuerdan a los brazos de @Madonna 

que guapa !!
7968 2018-10-19 21:31:17 I shampoo then deep condition every week with Eden bodyworks jojoba monoi deep conditioner. It’s bomb. Then I use shea moisture’s jbco leave in, Eden bodyworks curl defining cream and oil to moisturize. I don’t let anything besides shampoo or oil touch my scalp and that helps
7969 2018-10-19 21:31:16 Midnight Oil - Beds are Burning
7970 2018-10-19 21:31:16 Not a playground for kids... ABU all the way
7971 2018-10-19 21:31:08 I need some mineral oil for something, but I don't think I have any. Hate the stuff.
7972 2018-10-19 21:31:05 My son is getting married and I was telling a friend how excited I was but also sad because my parents wouldn't be able to go because my dad is 90 with dementia.  We just couldn't afford a hotel room. We can't even afford oil right now so it wasn't a priority.
7973 2018-10-19 21:30:50 The quest to return to Lucas Oil Stadium starts tonight! East Central at Franklin County, kickoff at 7:00 PM.
7974 2018-10-19 21:30:46 f1 really needs to get itself sorted...can not run in wet,bloody great plank under car.spend taking cars,staff,fuel,oil etc and lack of tyres to save money,fans spent money to watch nothing much...shameful...nanny state f1 with grid drops for ???
7975 2018-10-19 21:30:38 No go find oil boy trouble o
7976 2018-10-19 21:30:22 The danger lies in messing ones bio chemsitry with it prior to adult development (roughly 21). Only medically should it be used before 21 and really only once we know which cannabinoids are good for the trestments. Such as the use of CBD oil for seizures.
7977 2018-10-19 21:30:21 #UNNvsUNIZIK someone said unizik students eat grilled fish with palm oil and onions 
7978 2018-10-19 21:30:21 Facts: (1) US planners to pivot 2 South China Sea to face China has some mis-calculations, Obama’s destructive policies with Iran in the ME especially in Syria enabled Russia 2 rise, China is an economic power & Saudis if preasured can sell its oil with other currency.
7979 2018-10-19 21:30:19 Here can vegans drive? Because petrols made from oil and oils just dade dinosaurs eh?

7983 2018-10-19 21:28:54 Kindness, is the oil that takes the friction out of life. #FridayFeeling #FridayMotivation
7984 2018-10-19 21:28:50 Because what relation would conservation regulations have on mining and oil/gas? What industry is impacted by food safety regulations? The farming industry, one of the largest PAC's in our state. He voted for massive corporate handouts, is that supposed to help the common folk?
7985 2018-10-19 21:28:44 Tried frying ice cream inside bread. The ice cream wasn't hard enough so it melted into the oil.
7986 2018-10-19 21:28:40 Would me better for his health if you use less oil 
7987 2018-10-19 21:28:28 the real reason is that the money is going to oil
7988 2018-10-19 21:28:07 @BristolAirport hi, am I able to take CBD oil on board with me? Flying to Stockholm in a couple of weeks and wanted to double check. Thanks :)
7989 2018-10-19 21:28:07 I believe you have accepted thousands of dollars from major corporations. They include coal companies (Murray Energy, Arch Coal), oil companies (Marathon Petroleum) and natural gas companies (TransCanada, from whom Mountaineer Gas will buy the gas it will pipe to Rockwool).
7990 2018-10-19 21:28:06 Can I take one of the cardinals girls as a date
7991 2018-10-19 21:28:04 if it is just cbd oil you are after, there are tons of pet stores that are still selling it 'to help dogs', but it's exactly the same thing as the human kind.
7992 2018-10-19 21:27:54 Murphy, am at Felabration now and try to find something eat and I never see where egusi and ila soup cooked with vegetable oil in my life.
7993 2018-10-19 21:27:40 Northern gateway is another pipeline that should get going. It is absurd that we buy Saudi oil to supply the Maritimes.
7994 2018-10-19 21:27:36 We have been downplaying the bombing and starvation of millions for decades. If this is what it takes to get noticed and stop trading blood for oil I suggest sending a few more journalists critical of the Saudi regime over.
7995 2018-10-19 21:27:27 This is comparatively uncharted territory for Saudis, who are "used to" Pak govt taking a more conciliatory approach to Saudi concerns (real &/or imaginary)..
any substantial reduction n Pak's oil imports (in favour of gas or coal) is a medium to long term threat to Saudis..
5/5
7996 2018-10-19 21:27:26 Finally get to get this oil  boy

8001 2018-10-19 21:27:06 Yes I understand. In The Netherlands it isn't quite as common, but we use it as well. Our name for it, literally translated, is "cabbageseed oil".

For me cooking is not the first thing that comes to mind one can do with Rape Seed :)
8002 2018-10-19 21:26:52 How do I explain to a car repair service that I havent gotten my oil changed in 2 years

8009 2018-10-19 21:26:12 I did! They're deaf. Said I was providing logical fallacies & should be more civil. Because posting facts to support my claim Dems are for big oil/fracking is SO RUDE!!!

Seriously, the "rudest" thing I said was "you can't be this naive & uninformed." 
8010 2018-10-19 21:26:10 Hello women of the new earth.  I want to talk about CBD oil. How interesting and powerful it is.
8011 2018-10-19 21:25:34 帰宅民
8012 2018-10-19 21:25:25 If you really want to, put olive oil in a pan and heat them up on the stove top. I actually found that works pretty well 
8013 2018-10-19 21:25:22 You should snort some baby oil for that

8018 2018-10-19 21:24:45 It is not. Please add oil production downstream processes as well to your equation then. No need to add the cost of wars fought for it. Defending a 100 years old inferior combustion engine technology is very interesting
8019 2018-10-19 21:24:36 Tell them! Dia father!
8020 2018-10-19 21:24:35 Aww! Me too! But I am proud to have good oil and tyre recyclers that charge me and re-use. I seperare 5w30 and 10w40 waste. It gets filtered and turned into cheap 'comma oil' or 'own brand'. It's what I'm told.
8021 2018-10-19 21:24:33 And the #OSR hashtag- which is full of both #DND stuff, and oilseed rape (canola oil) farmers.

*not even top 20 recipients
8025 2018-10-19 21:24:04 Just drove by a local pizza shop with a sign urging customers to to try the shop’s new white pickle pizza. Even on a garlic and olive oil pizza, I have doubts about pickles as a pizza topping.
8026 2018-10-19 21:24:03 Syria isn't Iraq.
World powers don't care about Syria's oil fields. 
The war in Syria was started by Assad in response to the people's demands for change.
Your conspiracy theories show complete ignorance of the Middle East.
8027 2018-10-19 21:24:02 In spite of losing $100s of billions in tax revenue as a result of the tax reform fraud, the Dow is up a total of 2% this year. Oil prices up by 30% in the last year despite kissing the Saudi ass. What an economic genius.
8028 2018-10-19 21:23:48 Much like a potato, if you brush olive oil on it, it'll keep it from burning. Just make sure to keep an eye on it

8031 2018-10-19 21:23:01 Big oil would do well to heed the “Buggy Whip” lesson - evolve and innovate or go out of business.
8032 2018-10-19 21:22:59 I will do that there's been this big thing going on lately from Nigeria about oil rig engineer scams they've been taking women in the states for hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars it's an attack targeting women
8033 2018-10-19 21:22:57 Read the link. It's a loan that was used to initiate this job oo. Just $100m we paid and collected  $500m as loan. When oil was selling at $60 above our benchmark of $50. People stole billions of $ and you are here advocating for them.
8034 2018-10-19 21:22:56 Since Minnesota wants to be sooo dis-re-spect-ful to its Auntie, Mother Nature, let me just slide in here with my SUMMER  essential oil blend.  Sorry, not sorry, Fall.

8038 2018-10-19 21:22:25 we talking about the oil he says don’t dro that, I’m like wtf is dro,  drop???? Nigga sent me a screenshot of the definition of DROP from google
8039 2018-10-19 21:22:23 Your most consistent lyibg method is selection. Next common is ommission and exaggeration.  

Shame on you for your snake oil. Also, the FW stockyards are used to BS. Yours was as regular as a angus cow.
8040 2018-10-19 21:22:21 Really wanna see @RLGRIME tomorrow night but I also need new tires and an oil change.
8041 2018-10-19 21:22:18 The fact that you're comparing a 'Global Commodity' owned by a businessman with a single income channel of a nation only goes very far to stamp your receding thinking. 
How many countries do Nigeria supply oil?
How many countries use facebook?
8042 2018-10-19 21:22:04 SO NO PROOF! How does a tax return reveal business interests or investments in Saudi Arabia??? So if he invested in an oil stock, is that considered a conflict of interest? SMH! @cnn @CNNPolitics
8043 2018-10-19 21:21:50 Lying big oil money. Americans (not just liberals) want to be free from outdated sources of energy (oil, coal, fracking). A shift away from these planet polluting energy sources will create all kinds of jobs and opportunities.
8044 2018-10-19 21:21:42 let him go and eat s**t! 
'Nigeria problem is not money but how to spend it'
he said that before the oil boom turned to oil doom'
there is nothing to celebrate in his life save failure and genocides!

8045 2018-10-19 21:21:42 Mushy pea fritters?? Best thing ever. Mash a tin of mushy peas, add an egg, pepper and flour to make a thickish batter (couple of heaped tablespoons). Fry each cake in a tablespoon of hot oil - awesome. You get about 6-8.

8051 2018-10-19 21:21:12 Oil is not infinite. In the next 10-20 years, the fossil fuel usage will almost vanish and alternative energy will rise dramatically. @atiku
8052 2018-10-19 21:20:53 Y'all know Walmart does oil changes for $20 right?
8053 2018-10-19 21:20:41 Back-of-the-envelope calculation:
Round numbers: RU gold held = ca. 1 trillion bbl oil in gold equiv.
Total Russian oil exports now ca. 1.8bln bbl/yr.
So go from 1/8 to 1/4 on basis of oil exports only (if all payments converted into gold) would take 500+ yrs.
Hmm.
8054 2018-10-19 21:20:20 You can get infected by blood...palm oil is sweet.
8055 2018-10-19 21:20:18 On live TV, Paul LePage fails to persuade President Trump that international bankers are drilling for oil. Willie Robertson makes a regrettable bet.

8058 2018-10-19 21:20:15 Saudí Arabia diversify away from reliance on oil. But why beef burgers?
8059 2018-10-19 21:20:13 He and Trudeau could go to brunch.. Trudeau in his authentic Indian sari, and Booker as Spartacus,  of course. They could compare their manicures, and discuss whether oil or cream is better for hair masks. It would be special!!

8065 2018-10-19 21:19:05 The USA is oil independant. They produce all the oil they need yearly

8067 2018-10-19 21:18:49 I'd be buying up palm oil plantations and more lands and turning them into sanctuaries for animals.
8068 2018-10-19 21:18:43 U'v never read any thing from this man.
8069 2018-10-19 21:18:42 EVs have nothing to do with it; there aren't enough to matter. 

World oil prices matter less to the USA when domestic production rises and consumption falls. Both improved drastically in 2008 thanks to the crisis.

But it's the Saud PR money that matters most.
8070 2018-10-19 21:18:26 Very wrong assumption.
Some are JVs and others are PSC.
The oil does not belong to the Nigeria 100%.
This statement of yours is totally misleading.

I’m not confident this car is in the best condition to get me around safely. How can you get me the car I need?

8074 2018-10-19 21:18:04 I would be surprised that in Texas there would not be many gold toilets or silver spoons since there are a lot of oil tycoons.
8075 2018-10-19 21:18:03 Gentlemen worry not about age, I’ve just witnessed a woman in her early 60’s dribbling over an experienced oil worker nearly 70 in an artisan bar. There’s hope for us yet.....,

8083 2018-10-19 21:16:55 Laugh of the day goes to @nytimes for today’s episode of The Daily. Nothing like a discussion about the catastrophic consequences of climate change with a big oil ad (ExxonMobile) squeezed in the middle.
8084 2018-10-19 21:16:51 Well we DID that for a while. When we stopped doing it, some crazy lunatics oversees stole our national animal and building of power and started doing the same for oil instead of golds and bombs instead of gladii. 
8085 2018-10-19 21:16:47 Rick Scott has allowed big business to pollute Florida waters. We must not allow him to continue to the senate where he will vote with Trump on EVERY issue. He will be on the national level voting with oil and gas to pollute the country’s land, air, and water.
8086 2018-10-19 21:16:45 i believe its a control measure to reduce hoarding of cooking oil which will then be sold at exorbitant prices on the black market

8094 2018-10-19 21:16:04 Why keep saying this? Shorts are part of big oil... trying to kill climate talk, Tesla buys, etc... this'll only stop when they're gone... propaganda tools are cheap for trillion dollar big oil.
8095 2018-10-19 21:15:43 Legit just mixed two different serums and a drop of oil with my moisturiser to save time. Prob just messed up the entire formula

8097 2018-10-19 21:15:16 Sanctioning Saudi doesn’t benefit us - they spend billions on our weapons, property and sell oil cheaply. This is much bigger than that. It’s about human rights and freedom of speech. Think carefully before you support state murder of a fine journalist.

8103 2018-10-19 21:14:49 Our real gdp growth did OK in 17, but cooled off in 2018...and that was after TWO YEARS of economic contraction. The phrase "dead cat bounce" comes to mind. 2018 was a modest 2.8% and that's with the US booming and oil prices in the $70's.
8104 2018-10-19 21:14:29 The American Government are quick in putting sanctions on other countries except the Saudi murderous regime. The same Saudi citizens killed more three thousand Americans in one single day during the 9/11 terrorist attack. This is all about money, power and oil.
8105 2018-10-19 21:14:17 She had been vilified for decades by RW media. It was simple for Trump to just ride the coattails of that nonsense. Snake oil salesman is all he is.

8108 2018-10-19 21:13:48 With the amount of rail and tractor trailers bieng used to transport oil and gas. They cause more carbon pollution then a pipeline does and with many more trucks and trains the risk of rollovers and derailments will increase.

8115 2018-10-19 21:13:16 @pamperedchef  very disappointed that after a few years of not very heavy use, my stoneware bar pan is leaking oil and needs to be thrown away. No more pampered chef for me -  at least stand by your overpriced products!
8116 2018-10-19 21:13:00 As Saudi investments have usually been specific to real estate, Oil/Gas infrastructure or Saudi food security.. the culture for diversified investments in 3rd world industries has never figured high.. King Abdullah did try to expand this but not successfully

8117 2018-10-19 21:12:53 The leading cause of deforestation of the amazon and forests in Indonesia is palm oil. Palm oil is in every processed food item. America either needs to eat healthier, or stop letting money control everything.
8118 2018-10-19 21:12:49 We are now #1 in oil production in the world.
8119 2018-10-19 21:12:39 @vvlifechurch The person who murdered Pastor Roan Earle and his family by shooting them and also boiling their children alive in a pot of oil is Jenn Johnson.  Today, her family of origin wanted to kill her because she went too far.  So now, we are fighting against one witch...

8123 2018-10-19 21:12:16 Mothering techniques (scruff of the neck) and spray bottle worked for us! We also had an issue with clawing things up... put some mint essential oil in the spray bottle and our lil ladies stopped right away
8124 2018-10-19 21:12:16 Yo ass be scratching that’s why!!! oil his ass down
8125 2018-10-19 21:11:56 True. The Saudis and the Russians have other countries by the balls when it comes to oil. Fracking in the US is why we no longer need as much foreign oil. Most of our foreign oil comes from you guys, the Canadians! 
8126 2018-10-19 21:11:52 In the beginning oil created the heavens and the earth.
8127 2018-10-19 21:11:45 Do you have a source to this? I'm genuinely curious because I have a diet high in coconut oil and still get bug bites.
8128 2018-10-19 21:11:32 Yeah! Possibly. Your face has so many more oil glands. Harder to keep clean lol
8129 2018-10-19 21:11:31 Oil = the supposed stolen tweet

8137 2018-10-19 21:10:31 Sir! The amount of times I’ve said that the whole ‘most educated people’ notion is null and void if we aren’t having technical skills that actually solve our problems! Zimbabwe has peanuts, sunflowers, vegetables but dololo cooking oil production

8139 2018-10-19 21:10:09 RT @LivingSafely: #Pringles Cheddar Cheese this October? With less than 2% actual Cheddar Cheese, it has more salt, oil or MSG!
8140 2018-10-19 21:10:05 #MagnesiumOil is a bit of a misnomer. Our product is not an oil at all. Magnesium oil contains just purified water, magnesium chloride from the #DeadSea, and naturally occurring trace minerals. The high salinity of the product is what gives it a slightly oily feel.
8141 2018-10-19 21:10:04 It will always do that. I remember pumping gas in the early 70's and there would be a line of cars on both sides of the pump. That was during the OPEC oil embargo.

8143 2018-10-19 21:09:59 First time I decided to get waves I literally cut my hair to a 2.5, and I brushed for 10 mins straight and they showed up. No product, oil, pomade, none of that
8144 2018-10-19 21:09:56 It always sounded to simple that the Iraq invasion was about oil, but then again it turned out it was
8145 2018-10-19 21:09:52 I gave up on Rubin when he said the truth about climate change "lays somewhere in the middle" before playing softball with Alex Epstein, a literal oil lobbyst (or as they prefer "part of a for proft think tank"), then pretended it was no different than having Michael E. Mann on.

8147 2018-10-19 21:09:38 Our unemployment is up. Our provincial treasury is on pace to add $100 billion in debt, due to a $10 billion per year shortfall in oil revenues that is only going to get worse because of the massive differential in oil prices....which won't get better anytime soon.

8165 2018-10-19 21:07:51 I just want to remind the young people of Kuwait and the Arabian Gulf in general that Sh.Sabah when he was state secertary in the 80,s use to bug the late Amir of Bahrain SH.ISA to get red of the American naval base in Bahrain,and then came the reflagging of the oil tankers to

8168 2018-10-19 21:07:38 Yea plus it’s hard to tell what degree something is, squeaky wheels get the most oil anyways. Every community has a degree of undesirable aspects, I just see the issue with anime most because it’s predominantly who I interact with online

8171 2018-10-19 21:07:29 Enlighten further here for me.  Oil on the water has dropped quite a bit in October.  My assumption is tanker rates would drop along with it which is not happening.
8172 2018-10-19 21:07:25 I loveeee the way my legs shine with lotion and baby oil 
8173 2018-10-19 21:07:24 Yowsa yowsa yowsa !  Step right up and buy another bottle of Uncle Donnie's Snake Oil! A sure fire cure for everything! If BS were cash he WOULD actually be the wealthiest person in the universe.
8174 2018-10-19 21:07:23 I actually saw the report.  We can import oil from Canada and we are actually exporting a lot of oil.  Fracking has opened up a whole new source of oil.  However, I don’t think fracking is good for the environment in the long run.
8175 2018-10-19 21:07:12 Loooooooool.

We have oil sha.
8176 2018-10-19 21:07:07 Titanium dioxide is one example. Its used in processed candies, frosting & icing for bright white color; it is an ingredient in cosmetics & is the pigment used in many white oil paints/house paints. Does it bother you that we eat the same “flavoring” that is found in house paint?
8177 2018-10-19 21:07:02  The  #McCann$' snake oil salesman Clarence Mitchell has been rejected by Peterborough. I wonder where in the country the opportunist will try to get on the Tory PPC shortlist next? #WatchThisSpace

8180 2018-10-19 21:06:48 Never trust a lawyer or a career politician. Snake oil salesmen are more honest.
8181 2018-10-19 21:06:34 Someone tell me why you would put baby oil on your body before you work out, wanted to ask that guy why he was doing that.
8182 2018-10-19 21:06:34 Someone stop me from going into this artisanal olive oil shop and spending all my dollars.

8184 2018-10-19 21:06:08 Someone needs to tell "tiny" Orange Turd, that DNA testing does not involve a urine test....or is that why he says he won't enjoy it?
8185 2018-10-19 21:06:06 In Mexico, adobo is a seasoning made from dried chiles, herbs, salt, and spices, ground together with vinegar to the consistency of a thick paste. It is similar to the Spanish mixture of the same name, which calls for vinegar, olive oil, and spices.
8186 2018-10-19 21:06:02 NO I read that It can cause some type of pneumonia. U need hash oil for your pen. I’m waiting on amazon to deliver the equipment I need to make it. Hopefully within the week I’ll have hash oil too
8187 2018-10-19 21:06:02 With the latest $2 million @ProtectCO contribution, #Amendment74 now has nearly $10 million in oil money to support an amendment w/disastrous collateral damage potential.  It is & always has been oil's proposal. Do they not care about their local governments? The COGCC? #VoteNO
8188 2018-10-19 21:05:47 Brexit is simply not deliverable in the manner in which it was sold. Brextremists are snake oil salesmen.

8193 2018-10-19 21:05:23 That is true - however, at least he hasn't sent any troops to non-national security threat wars, nor wars for oil.  Though he should reduce our foot print.
8194 2018-10-19 21:05:10 my mom took my car to get an oil change yesterday and messed with my seat so much that I can’t get it back how I had it. now i’m angry
8195 2018-10-19 21:04:58 um, yes, it can.  it can be FAR worse and often is.  coal and oil are sued for electricity.

and wind is such an eco disaster based on rare earth inputs creating radioactive waste that it makes either look great.

you're just making stuff up and pretending it's facts

Me: Yes, here to drop my car off for service. Do you know how much my bill will be? 

Volkswagen: BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH $239

Me:  Face chopped and screwed.  Don’t do none of that Change my oil.  Thank you
8201 2018-10-19 21:04:42 That’s some fine twisting of the facts there. I guess that comes very easy when you’ve been supporting the snake oil salesman for a couple of years.

8209 2018-10-19 21:03:28 Optimism is the finest trait one can have in life and you have it in abundance my friend!

To answer your question, no more tech for me. Tech for oil 2 years ago.
8210 2018-10-19 21:03:23 Cool, but we’re taking all the oil with us.
8211 2018-10-19 21:03:18 Buy a sack of the little potatoes. Slightly bigger than your thumb. Rinse. Put them in a casserole dish with a heavy drizzle of olive oil. Enough to mostly coat them. Sprinkle with your favorite seasoning - I use seasoned salt, but you could use any of the Mrs Dash seasonings.
8212 2018-10-19 21:03:13 It’s an early 50s one. The new tank has helped but a lot of the other parts are old. It was converted to oil from wood fired in the late 70s and some of the bits date from then. It was a bit of a lash up to start off with. It’s very temperamental.
8213 2018-10-19 21:03:08 can you break where the oil is and put it into a different cartridge? i do that with ones with wicks because they burn the concentrate 
8214 2018-10-19 21:03:00 Lots of deep pockets in auto industry and oil that don’t want it to succeed. Completely crooked and corrupt world we live in
8215 2018-10-19 21:02:40 Yooooooooo  Did you write 3x serving in the oil on your plate fam?
8216 2018-10-19 21:02:37 Machine Learning/AI marketed at the individual level is snake oil.  I don't want you to suggest what OTHERS like, I want you to know what I like.  

Looking at you @Netflix, stop with these scary/haunted movie recommendations.
8217 2018-10-19 21:02:37 @Hyundai what are you going to do about the 2013 Sonata engines?? Mine was taken in during the recall to check for metal in oil....just paid off and has 127k miles. Guess what it has? Also drinking oil daily! So disappointed

8222 2018-10-19 21:02:02 Use oil 
8223 2018-10-19 21:01:50 Tillerson held the Russian Order if Friendship and was an oil exec. Putin loves oil and gas above all else. Guaranteed revenue he can keep siphoning out of an impoverished nation.
8224 2018-10-19 21:01:44 I have several lavender bushes in my yard so this summer I harvested some and made my own oil ;soaked in olive oil for a month or so. Now I use it as a body oil after showers. It cannot be used like an essential oil, though. That is different.
8225 2018-10-19 21:01:37 So turns out inhaling tea tree oil is great for relieving headaches

8235 2018-10-19 21:00:45 Once I get off work today I'm about to go home, uber eats myself something disgustingly decadent with no nutritional value, oil my scalp and wrap my hair, [redacted], and then relax like I've literally never relaxed before.

In 1989, an oil tanker struck a reef in Alaska. Before operators could get the spill under control, millions of  gallons of oil had escaped. This is undoubtedly one of the worst man-made environmental disasters ever.
8237 2018-10-19 21:00:37 Many fall off, run over, kidnapped along the way. They are extorted and abused . The human toll making this journey is horrific.

We need someone to speak for us.

8255 2018-10-19 20:59:14 Pipelines get oil to port. Export capacity won’t significantly change for 3-5 years until new infrastructure comes online
8256 2018-10-19 20:59:13 Yes I oversimplified as we currently use gas to power some parts of our economy. Yes oil affects more than its own sector, but the real hunger for every Nigerian has to be “how else can we earn forex?”
8257 2018-10-19 20:59:12 stop trying to sell me snake oil
8258 2018-10-19 20:59:11 @realDonaldTrump 
We invade countries like Iraq for what, oil. But we don't  launch against South American drug producers. Why. Because  US banks launder billions of their dirty money. You ok with that?
8259 2018-10-19 20:59:07 i got some nut oil for u
8260 2018-10-19 20:59:01 You ever smell jojoba oil fawm. Shawties luhh that shit. That's what my boy told me.
8261 2018-10-19 20:58:56 Better be careful or we could have another 73 oil embargo
8262 2018-10-19 20:58:53 Just took 3 shots of crown and bout to smoke my oil pen to celebrate our new house. 
Bout to get some sloppy drunk sex tonight 
8263 2018-10-19 20:58:50 The Japanese bought a lot of oil and steel from the US prior to WW2. At some point, you have to look at who you are doing business with and realize they are not your friends. If they do terrible things, like murder journalists, you have to cut them loose.

8267 2018-10-19 20:58:37 We actually import a ton of oil from there still. Sadly.
8268 2018-10-19 20:58:33 reminder that snake oil is an incredible game
8269 2018-10-19 20:58:33 Venezuela went under bc there former president relied on the massive amounts of oil his country had and once the price plummeted everyone went down with it
8270 2018-10-19 20:58:31 It’s incredible that in the early 80)s with mass unemployment and thatcher closing our industries so few of us thought as an oil rich country we might be better off on our own.

8276 2018-10-19 20:57:39 @JosephEllis408 can you eat chick fil a breaded chicken?? It’s cooked in peanut oil. I’m too scared to try
8277 2018-10-19 20:57:26 We both there’s answer to anything. But electricity can’t be worse than draining oil from the ground. Just the pollution that it creates in the cities is  unbearable
8278 2018-10-19 20:57:22 The courts would order it in a flash. You should see the law suits BP gets if they spill a drop transporting oil.
8279 2018-10-19 20:57:10 That's not 100% true. The reason the economy collapsed in 2016 was that we didn't have forex supply to support manufacturing. Oil proceeds is what supports them. Which is why I don't think we should limit impact of crude oil crash to what % of the gdp it is.
8280 2018-10-19 20:57:05 Pro tip, peeps:  do NOT oil up your neck before going to see your chiropractor. 

(The hell?! Never did I think this would be advice I would have to give.)
8281 2018-10-19 20:56:36 How much are these people gonna judge me if I down a Coke right now...? 
-pregnant me at the oil change
8282 2018-10-19 20:56:33 No you are not wrong..I just didn't want you to think they are fooling us. We are not needing their oil anymore. But, if we can sneak in Western ideas and help the ppl be more free by sending them Western businesses then we will. It is really us fooling them 
8283 2018-10-19 20:56:29 Exactly. And that was never my intention. So why am I being called stupid sexist and racist. They don’t even know if that’s what I stand for... more into politics as in oil and such rather than an opinion towards women or other races.
8284 2018-10-19 20:56:12 May not be primary motivating factor but statistically true.  Democrats refer to them as constituents. While not intentional perhaps on the part of migrants, end result is the same. Yes they will.
8285 2018-10-19 20:56:00 They have micro managed our economy and taken out important industries like OIL..and created a fragility in the Canadian economy that is not able to withstand economic uncertainty..our only saving grace has been Donald Trump.
8286 2018-10-19 20:55:59 We’ve done it your way long enough, Fake Big Oil Profile, and all it’s done is pollute and cook the atmosphere.  Time to focus on newer cleaner technologies, ones that will also create American jobs.
8287 2018-10-19 20:55:49 I told Debbie I don’t need any peppermint oil cause I’ve got enough junior mints running through me.

You are shaking the same table OBJ/Atiku are on. (Generator, Oil, Imports).
8290 2018-10-19 20:54:49 New Mexico has every gift of nature—great sunrises and sunsets, magnificent mountains, almost unlimited sun, fabulous farm products that taste great. And the panorama of its history is wide and diverse. We shouldn’t let Oil&Gas destroy it.
8291 2018-10-19 20:54:35 Vegetable oil is made from rapeseed , soybean, mmellon etc  ... 
But in Naija ile we call it groundnut oil,  obviously it's extracted from Groudnut.
8292 2018-10-19 20:54:23 
8293 2018-10-19 20:54:22 I usually boil the kettle, pour in a bowl, scoop the C oil into a cup and put the cup in the bowl :)

8295 2018-10-19 20:54:05 Personally, I really don’t like the flavour it has, even though other people tell me it’s mild. Olive oil or a mixed veg oil for me
8296 2018-10-19 20:54:04 26 days without fried food, oil, fatty stuff.
8297 2018-10-19 20:54:02 Whenever I start saving a big expense comes out. like replacing my tires, then oh registration, then oh oil change & safety same time (mind u my oil changes are like $120 minimum) . Like errghhh impossible to save , I been stuck at the same amount for like 6months 
8298 2018-10-19 20:54:00 How in the hell do vegans justify driving cars if oil and gasoline are by products of animals? #vegan #vegancat
8299 2018-10-19 20:53:55 夢見が悪くて目が覚めてしまった。ぼんやりとしか覚えてないけど昨日の続きっぽいような…？起きるには早いから二度寝しよう
8300 2018-10-19 20:53:53 I’m so happy I found this $20 coupon for my oil change causeeee listen!
8301 2018-10-19 20:53:34 That doesn’t matter. We are still vastly dependent on oil, and we are deliberately slowing the transition to clean energy. As long as that’s the case, the Saudis will stay in business. This has to be a global effort.
8302 2018-10-19 20:53:32 Great question, Josie! For our Buitoni pasta, we would list sesame, sesame oil, or sesame seeds in the ingredient statement.
8303 2018-10-19 20:53:30 @Cashslow $BXE is at all time lows while the crude oil price has up 35% this year. Perhaps the price of natural gas may help? I don't know.

8306 2018-10-19 20:53:22 Cool I put that as well as that green Axe Oil
8307 2018-10-19 20:53:14 I swear I can't never just get a oil change. Its always 50 extra things they wanna tell you about car. Lol
8308 2018-10-19 20:53:02 Got my oil changed today cus my ass will forget
8309 2018-10-19 20:52:52 I think the thing that bothers me the most about the Saudis is the attitude of MBS. Oil money has obviously made him feel that he can even buy his way out of a murder with 100 million dollar cash payment to the U.S. The murder, in and of itself, was sooooooo in our faces!
8310 2018-10-19 20:52:50 Apparently my car only accepts the most expensive oil and I drive 2 hours for work 6 days a week. Fun.

8313 2018-10-19 20:52:31 I know you're sponsored by Audible but was kinda dissapointed when Jason Murphy didn't do a shoutout of his book at the end... Timing was perfect.

Also why eat baby oil after saying not to eat baby oil?
8314 2018-10-19 20:52:29 Lol cuz he puts it in oil n rubs it on his skin
8315 2018-10-19 20:52:26 Give it a rest, “Jan.”  Big Oil’s been getting billions of dollars in corporate subsidies courtesy of the American tax payers while making record profits.  It’s time to focus on cleaner more sustainable sources of energy.
8316 2018-10-19 20:52:26 Why is it necessary for the dealer to take my car all day for a damn oil change? I have shit do do ppl to see
8317 2018-10-19 20:52:25 Triple whammy of sharp increases in global oil prices, new taxes for consumer price-sensitive sectors, and the peso currency devaluation - courtesy of tokhang torture regime, with the senate majority to blame, along with king droga.
8318 2018-10-19 20:52:23 4 hour oil change 
8319 2018-10-19 20:52:23 Actually, we are not that dependent on their oil as we once were.
8320 2018-10-19 20:52:17 You can use the paraffin and oil in chocolate to start a fire
8321 2018-10-19 20:52:17 I’m not talk big conditioner or oil... I’m talking wave cream and Dax and stuff that is used to MAKE the hair wavey....

8328 2018-10-19 20:51:05 #Khashoggi as horrible as this event is, there is a silver lining.  A Saudi oil embargo before the midterms would help Democrats take back power and save our nation.
8329 2018-10-19 20:50:59 Buhari should come and see what the flood has caused in the Niger Delta where the country's oil monies are coming from. He is the president of the country.
8330 2018-10-19 20:50:56 Yes Yes an NO...when the oil companies an everyone else pulls out of Saudi i will hold WWE accountable ...an say NO they shouldn't ...there are NO two sets of rules here....the whole world is in bed with Saudi ...just not WWE
8331 2018-10-19 20:50:49 Pure b*******. It was the diversification of our economy and investment in all the Commodities and oil created by the conservatives that helped us with stand 2008 crisis. Furthermore, we can regulate Banks other countries to a certain extent cannot.
8332 2018-10-19 20:50:41 C'mon just because they take millions from oil companies and other corporations! Don't you know Queen Hillary was fracking FOR the environment
8333 2018-10-19 20:50:24 #Khashoggi as horrible as this event is, there is a silver lining.  A Saudi oil embargo before the midterms would help Democrats take back power and save our nation.
8334 2018-10-19 20:50:21 I don’t think there will severe punishment for KSA as it might cause a lot of turmoils in the market, given the fact that oil related sanctions on Iran will be put into full effective. MBS may get sacrificed though in this case.
8335 2018-10-19 20:50:20 Yes it looks like filling station...what do you think of oil money..its always lit!
8336 2018-10-19 20:50:20 Lies. We have too much interest in Saudi oil for the US to do anything.
8337 2018-10-19 20:50:06 يارب امنياتي فهي لا تعجزك
8338 2018-10-19 20:50:03 Well sure, if you’ve got oil these days, you’re set.

8340 2018-10-19 20:49:47 Much more shit. Fox inflated those numbers. Unemployment has been steadily dropping since 2009, NK still has nukes (Kim’s lying) stock market just lost 1,400 pts (Trump said any president who had a stock market loss over 1,000 should resign,) it will crash again, Oil is up
8341 2018-10-19 20:49:43 #Khashoggi as horrible as this event is, there is a silver lining.  A Saudi oil embargo before the midterms would help Democrats take back power and save our nation.
8342 2018-10-19 20:49:32 Bush was responsible for a minimum of 4 wars to steal other countries' asset of oil (Bush family business). The Iraq War cost USA approximately $6 trillion with deaths of 4,500 American soldiers. Hence, the recession
8343 2018-10-19 20:49:28 The @pepboysauto in Garner took over 2 hours (and counting) FOR AN OIL CHANGE. Do not take your car here.
8344 2018-10-19 20:49:27 i’m a sophomore, my dumb self was thinking baby oil since its freak fest  but i know better
8345 2018-10-19 20:49:23 get the oil in u at once as Jesus wants all u be renevated as a house painted and all prettied up with a new wallpaint such/u be that glorious stone Lord loves beauty and wants a bunch of beauty stones in his church body-
8346 2018-10-19 20:49:22 I really wanna leave how to change my own oil
8347 2018-10-19 20:49:21 oil and beard balm and if you are prone to dandruff that too with some hairfood.
8348 2018-10-19 20:49:08 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
8349 2018-10-19 20:49:03 US stock market is up mainly due to US sanction on Iran which boosted oil and other stocks(sentiments), and oil over $60 means shale industry becomes active again(and thus more economic activity in other sectors)
Meanwhile trade deficit has grown with china and others.
8350 2018-10-19 20:49:03 and get  nother teach u now-some need go back to milk of word can profit em -some have fires all burn out of em-not u right-don't let u be one of the virgins with no oil of joy left at all in u man!!!!
8351 2018-10-19 20:48:54 2.5 hours for a oil change is out line as hell
8352 2018-10-19 20:48:50 It’s a: new well pump and air tank, both cars needing inspection & oil changes & new tires, car insurance x3 due, registration x2 due, filled up on propane bill due and hospital bill arrived kind of day ...#broke #whoneedsmoney #whenitrainsitpours
8353 2018-10-19 20:48:49 Since over 3 years ago the Ogoni clean up was announced by PMB,no single drop of oil has been cleaned. Stop deceiving people!
8354 2018-10-19 20:48:46 I think getting my car serviced on time and with the highest quality oil is by far the most adult thing I’ve done to date.
8355 2018-10-19 20:48:45 Of all the crude oil that is imported into the United States, only 8% comes from Saudi Arabia. We don’t really depend on them for that anymore.
8356 2018-10-19 20:48:39 Who cares what #Infowars says man #AlexJones is a sensationalist, snake oil sales man that's one #meme from being totally irreverent. If some kid's find #furry from a Wal-Mart Mask bin then who cares ^o.+^
8357 2018-10-19 20:48:33 Where can I get an oil change for a reasonable price and don’t take 80 hours
8358 2018-10-19 20:48:31 Winter is coming! Don't forget to oil your wood products. Can you see the difference? #MyHabitatAK #mysteryoil #beeswax
8359 2018-10-19 20:48:21 No govt is perfect. It’s not right to criticise without concrete facts. The recession we entered into was not due to previous govt’s incompetence. It was primarily due to fall in oil prices & secondarily due Buhari’s incompetence manifested by taking 6months to have a cabinet
8360 2018-10-19 20:48:12 I’m just tryna buy CBD oil for my chronic back pain, but nobody accepts vertical cards and I’m just :)))

8362 2018-10-19 20:47:46 White rice, sweet beans and peppery stew is one of my favorite things ever. Too lit!! Especially if it’s palm oil stew
8363 2018-10-19 20:47:34 - Gotta get My Baby some beard oil! 

I was just in the men’s isle at work looking at the men’s stuff to get Bae... #NewEnergySameStrongVibes
8364 2018-10-19 20:47:25 Wages have remained stagnant while the cost of fuel, home heating oil, and groceries have increased. The middle class is getting screwed while the 1% profited in the billions. The @gop is corrupt
8365 2018-10-19 20:47:24 I get waves with coconut oil and brushing and durag usage.
8366 2018-10-19 20:47:21 Ah not good, how old is it now? Probably didn’t fare well with that old oil tank! Has it been better since the new tank was put in?
8367 2018-10-19 20:47:20 Not quite as cool as the oil derrick but I liked it, looked pretty cool with the orange & blue lights

8369 2018-10-19 20:47:10 I wanna live in Saudi And drink oil
8370 2018-10-19 20:47:08 If we pay per barrel for oil, how is that investing in the USA?
8371 2018-10-19 20:47:05 I’ve been advised to find the older gentleman with a large belt buckle and a dnr and no family. 

Sounds like oil money.
8372 2018-10-19 20:46:41 But crude oil is more important than the oil revenue in and of itself sha.
8373 2018-10-19 20:46:33 With everyone working 2-3 jobs to pay for the heating oil, gas and everything else that is suddenly jumped in price I guess that is a good thing. Better would be a real President and to do away with the tax break for the rich, our debt is higher than it's ever been.
8374 2018-10-19 20:46:28 Wheel nuts we're hitting in excess of 150nm they were tight. I guess we will see. I suspect he's going to do the next service, so I can't wait to see what horrors come my way. Shhh... Just for fun, I marked the oil filter
8375 2018-10-19 20:46:20 Anyone still think that #Amendment74 has anything to do with ag??? @ProtectCO - the main group opposing #Prop112 - just dumped another $2 million into support for 74. A few hothead oil execs w/deep pockets calling the shots. Ag still can't point to any actual problems #VoteNO

8379 2018-10-19 20:45:52 Twitter can turn you into a very dark man if you let it. I just had to put some blessed oil on my phone. #JesusTaketheWheel
8380 2018-10-19 20:45:51 Plus oil was in the single digits of $ per barrel till the 70s or so and was $40 ish as recently as during the OBJ tenure
8381 2018-10-19 20:45:44 Peppermint oil on your temples works for me.

8383 2018-10-19 20:45:19 my mans told this girl she gotta get a oil change before she can come over 
8384 2018-10-19 20:45:14 I try to have nutrient rich meals all right, and had olive oil, with the fish on a bed of green beans, with cranberry orange juice for my drink.

8386 2018-10-19 20:44:59 I'm a chocoholic but have avoided palm oil, read the ingredients to find it has been added (hadn't read them in a good while). 
No harm if I stay off the Chocs anyway!
8387 2018-10-19 20:44:48 Then where will you find oil?
8388 2018-10-19 20:44:48 Futminna is just the best. No doubts about that.
8389 2018-10-19 20:44:39 We will embrace the villainous kingdom due to their unctuous and oleaginous oil. We will be complicit because it is good for business. In God We Trust.

8390 2018-10-19 20:44:34 Yeah, but how long will the oil last? What will the bin Sauds do when the petrodollars dry up? Isn’t that the whole point of the 2030 thing MbS is pushing? What place will Saudi Arabia have when all that’s left is sand and a few glittering oases?
8391 2018-10-19 20:44:25 I wasn’t allowed some £1 Maltesers but Ritchie was allowed an £8.50 bottle of oil for his car 
8392 2018-10-19 20:44:20 EVs feel cheaper cause we dont need to drop $100 at a gas station every other week. We don't need to drop $200 for an oil change every 6 months. We don't need to repair any of the 100's of parts found in a gas car that aren't found in an electric car.
8393 2018-10-19 20:44:13 I’m addicted to being covered in oil before shoots tho... so... 
8394 2018-10-19 20:44:11 I saw a documentary about a smallholder Kenyan farmer who produces cooking oil from his own sunflower harvest.
8395 2018-10-19 20:44:00 Sent Jacob to tquah to get an oil change and he’s coming home with a new truck.  can’t have him do anything without him coming home with something.
8396 2018-10-19 20:43:37 3. We should be looking at ways of getting off foreign oil and supporting our own citizens. #TMX is only one, Energy East and Northern Gateway are game changers for Canada. I don't believe we should buy another drop from Saudi for all the reasons you already know.
8397 2018-10-19 20:43:35 Full spectrum dominance controled opposition it ended up being indeed. Those that support it do so with honorable intentions without analysing it's actual content and the reality of the snake oil saleman corporation that sold it to us as an extension of our Bill of RIghts.

8430 2018-10-19 20:38:52 not as good as leveling manually obviously, but if the oil wasn't going to use anyway, may as well get some levels out of it
8431 2018-10-19 20:38:29 They'll definitely re-run it in the future, there's already a re-run event for the cranes in the other versions haha. 

If you find yourself capping oil btw, the 8-10 hour / 1-1.2k oil expeditions are good to level your ships when you can't be assed to.
8432 2018-10-19 20:38:23 The Diffs are open, as u may have seen on my videos. I put 100k diff oil in & it made it a lot better on dirt, if u plan on climbing a bit more I'd recommend locking them. Also look at a bigger capacity battery. You can get some 2000mah+ ones on ebay I think.

8497 2018-10-19 20:30:25 Yeah. And those emissions do not count the emissions of the tar sands  products burned outside of Canada (we don’t have to include those) If they are counted in, it’s a very different story. The climate doesn’t care where the oil is burned.
8498 2018-10-19 20:30:17 Like a vampire, he drinks oil out of robots.
8499 2018-10-19 20:30:03 POW! POW!
After those deadly shots rang out, everything moved in slow motion.  
I no longer felt the air in my lungs and blood in my veins. Blood circled my mother’s body like an oil spill. I was stuck, I could not move. #writeaskew #behindeverybosstheresabae #kindle #amazon

8507 2018-10-19 20:28:48 Tiri kubika doro shaaaa, cooking oil for the why kkkkkk
8508 2018-10-19 20:28:26 getting an oil change rn & there’s a cute worker, what should I do?
8509 2018-10-19 20:28:23 And now we're changing it by adding megatons of gases which further increase the ability of the atmosphere to trap heat. But you've been properly brainwashed by the oil/gas/coal companies to ignore the problem because you'll be dead before we really have to contend anyway.
8510 2018-10-19 20:28:10 I'll still be flying with them, just not that Friday special. And yes that oil price is lovely :)
8511 2018-10-19 20:28:10 *takes car to walmart for oil change*
**takes keys with her so they can't move her car to work on it**
***drive of shame back to walmart***
8512 2018-10-19 20:28:00 The Kingdom is the ally and friend of America for more than 80 years. If the goal in your Saudi speech is to have a war, we are not Iraq or any country we are strong in God, our army is great. If your aim is to export oil as a friend, we are present
8513 2018-10-19 20:27:55 No individual should jeopardize the Saudi  -US relationship He is a Saudi and it’s their problem to solve  We have no real input that’s valid in this matter. You want $300bbl oil???
8514 2018-10-19 20:27:54 ¿Qué tal es para eso el «CBD Oil?»
8515 2018-10-19 20:27:47 Femi Falana says $12.2b worth of oil was stolen under Jonathan. He called on the oil union to prevail on the government to trace the funds, saying past efforts to do so have been unsuccessful.
8516 2018-10-19 20:27:35 Why hasn’t Xavi retired yet. He’s now been playing against oil farmers in Qatar for the same amount of time that Pirlo was at Juventus, just quit fella.
8517 2018-10-19 20:27:28 Ever notice something bad happens to anybody that wants to get off oil or not go to war? #weird
8518 2018-10-19 20:27:27 I’m for all energy
8519 2018-10-19 20:27:12 For oils "I'm comfortable leaving this in the hands of the people in charge of his care" but I have a "burn it all down" approach to snake oil bullshit "cures"
8520 2018-10-19 20:27:07 Get your dog's some red cedar shaving pillows. Then get yourself some real cedar essential oil and create a spray that you can spray all around the corners of your home. You can dilute it with coconut oil or olive oil and rub it on your dog's fur to further repel fleas.
8521 2018-10-19 20:27:01 i think homegirl really tried to act like i didn’t set an appointment to get an oil change....just like i do every other time........

I don't know why this okitipupa people are so ignorant. They want to compare a science school with a medical school?
Your VC can't even brag about your school.
You guys should go back to the farm to make Palm oil since that's only what you guys can do 
8525 2018-10-19 20:26:32 Its what we do for a living, Enterprise development, and we are betting big on agriculture! like I said before Agriculture is our "oil" and we will make something out of it..
8526 2018-10-19 20:26:25 Today's stew ehn... They added palm oil 
8527 2018-10-19 20:26:18 babe took my car to get an oil change for me and I’m just so grateful 
8528 2018-10-19 20:26:15 Kalo udah pake olive oil, gausah pake air lagi
8529 2018-10-19 20:26:13 Go back to Congo where you came from because I don't know what you're disputing here. A report by NBS & you're asking? Were you here when banks, oil & gas etc were retrenching staff? Blind argument
8530 2018-10-19 20:26:04 Im 2004 pickup with all the oil inside of me
8531 2018-10-19 20:25:53 Took an entry position in $BTE today, based on the weekly chart. 2000 shares @ $3. Willing to wait this one out a few weeks, I like the risk/reward on it.  Could be a triple bottom, or I'll get stopped or timed out.  #bottomfish #oil

Also you know #US has created Chaos in middle east as they get 4 major benefits.
1. Sales of their useless US arms by creating war.
2. Construction contracts for US companies for reconstructing the demolished buildings in ME.
3. Oil for cheaper.
8537 2018-10-19 20:24:35 The best thing for the world would be to prosecute the evil Saudi Arabia royals for murder and buy the oil from Iran who have sanctions on them because that is what Is ray il want from America who they now control

8541 2018-10-19 20:24:07 Update to your update: you can get into Lucas Oil for free any day if you throw a brick through the glass and walk in.
8542 2018-10-19 20:24:06 The scape goat has already been casted. The duplicitous Saudis government narrative is apocryphal and offensive. It is constantly in flux and everchanging as the shapes and contours of sand dunes. Their odious barbarity cannot be soothe away with the unctuous product of oil.
8543 2018-10-19 20:24:03 What does that have to do with you selling out CO citizens' air and water to the oil and gas industry? Health > Corporate profits
8544 2018-10-19 20:23:47 You are VERY nieve... This is big oil... will NOT stop. Climate still being smeared... This is their death gasp... NOT GOING AWAY TILL THEY'RE DEAD
8545 2018-10-19 20:23:46 Bought some stuff in pick n pay today and without being asked I was just given a 2l bottle of cooking oil and of course I accepted (I actually didn’t need it, but thought of a relative who might).

I doubt there’s anywhere in this world where such shopping practices exist. 


8546 2018-10-19 20:23:44 Went to big o tires for a lil oil change and changing my filters and now I gotta get brakes and a tire  rip my paycheck
8547 2018-10-19 20:23:41 Pake masker kan ada maximalnya.. Wajarnya sih pake masker maximal 20menitan. Mungkin kalo pake olive oil, kering gak kering kalo udah 20menitan mesti dibilas (?)
8548 2018-10-19 20:23:33 @ZoesKitchen Littleton, CO. I’m disappointed in my lunch today. I ordered Sorrentina Baked Ravioli and Tossed Greek Salad. The Ravioli was over cooked/burned. Very hard to chew. The salad dressing lacked any flavor. It was only oil. Not sure if I want to order again.
8549 2018-10-19 20:23:19 For any in #WashingtonState considering voting for #Initiative1631, remember that exactly NO businesses pay any tax or fee increase. It's passed onto the consumer in higher prices. So you won't be sticking it to the oil companies; you'll be sticking it to yourself. #VoteNo #I1634
8550 2018-10-19 20:23:12 I'm really surprised Nigerians are not twittering about this landmark case!

8555 2018-10-19 20:22:13 This country just keeps getting worse. We have a municipal election in Toronto next Tuesday and my city council candidates are only talking about oil pipelines that won't come within 1000 miles of the city.
8556 2018-10-19 20:22:06 Can you reveal if resources are permanent or finite?

I remember needing infinite resources mods, to retain the asthetics of mining or oil fields, because otherwise they'd all flip to processing eventually. 
8557 2018-10-19 20:22:06 Having grown up in the Houston area, my mom remembers how there was a rivalry between Houston and Dallas.  The people working in the oil refineries lived in Houston, while the owners lived in Dallas.  Robert Altman's "Dr. T and the Women" shows what Dallas is like.
8558 2018-10-19 20:22:03 Best of luck to @GC_Bands tonight at Lucas Oil Stadium!! We will be there cheering you all on!!! #GoCougars
8559 2018-10-19 20:22:01 I was literally watching this game then went to change my oil.... what the flipping flip flop
8560 2018-10-19 20:21:49 What happens to these majestic animals when the environment they live in is ruined by burning fossil fuels (and fracking)?!
Please open your eyes and stop supporting oil.
8561 2018-10-19 20:21:47 it's about using oil revenue to subsidize the western arms industry at this point
8562 2018-10-19 20:21:43 Can I commission you to make a giant oil painting of this so I can sneak it into the Detroit museum of art?
8563 2018-10-19 20:21:41 La Beastia is one of the main ways they get here, they are fed and watered along the way by locals. Its 1,800 mi this is only a few days by train.  Busses and other transport is probably being organized now.
8564 2018-10-19 20:21:39 going to get my oil change 
8565 2018-10-19 20:21:34 “But money isn’t everything. We can tough it out. Just like we could probably tough out surging oil prices if the Saudis decide to curtail production in response to tougher American policies.”
8566 2018-10-19 20:21:29 I only know two places in the Midlands that’s still do it this way. Ones stuck inside the Black Country Muesum and gets massive cues, the other is on Cradley Health high street. Proper taste the difference compared to cooked in bland rapeseed oil. Don’t normally eat chip shop!
8567 2018-10-19 20:21:27 Do you notice that the Oil D seem really slow getting back to move the puck compared to other teams D?  It always seems there is a forechecker right on top of them.....and then its chipped off the glass or coughed up. We never get enough out of our forwards because of this.
8568 2018-10-19 20:21:23 Thank you.

Red peppers sautéd in the oil from fried Chorizo, butter beans, Passata, bit of ketchup, hot sauce, balsamic vinegar (can't afford Spanish PX vinegar)
Pork Loin medallions fried like steak, whilst resting deglaze pan with balsamic and butter. Apply to pork on dish.
8569 2018-10-19 20:21:18 it's true, we get almost half of our #oil from #canada now. you know, that country donald keeps insulting? 
8570 2018-10-19 20:21:00 Western Canadian Select is low grade
Arabian oil is generally a mid-grade
WTI is higher grade
Shale oil is very high grade

A blend of shale and WCS works well for many US gulf refineries so there could be big appetite for WCS.

8573 2018-10-19 20:20:54 America must stop threatening its citizens who can help humanity eliminate reliance on petrodollars. Too bad oil bites the dust. I care for the future of humanity, not for the pockets of the super rich.

But I'm freaking out that I never heard a giant oil tanker driving in! I can hear a chainsaw from 2 fields over

8589 2018-10-19 20:19:04 @_Reefer_Madness @Rudy187 I'm making cannabis infused olive oil this weekend. Do need to add water to the oil when it's cooking? I usually add some water when doing coconut oil/butter as they are solid when refrigerated and easily separated from the water . Slow cooker method 
8590 2018-10-19 20:18:59 beautiful face could be corrupted by a handfull (ok, a shitload) of oil profits? You got any evidence other than the taxes he never pays, and the loans he never pays back, and...and

else could be done?

8603 2018-10-19 20:17:38 It should/will. CBD oil has been a legally regulated product for a while as it's not a controlled substance. So legalizing marijuana would have no effect on the cbd oil market.
8604 2018-10-19 20:17:32 Yep...but still a long way in biofuels,(fortunatly for oil dependant countries like us)
8605 2018-10-19 20:17:31 Finally getting a oil change for my car and see why TCS light came on my car
8606 2018-10-19 20:17:25 Oh you speak the language of the devil..... The Lord says, America must burn coal. Use vast quantities of oil. The skies must be dark with pollution. Rivers must be poisoned. The Lord spake and it is his will.
Meanwhile, in places of government enlightenment.....

8617 2018-10-19 20:16:28 We and the Saudis are not friends. We have nothing in common. We like their oil being on the open market, they like buying our weapons to kill people in Yemen. This is more like 2 junkies swapping their drug of choice in a street alley than serious international alliance.
8618 2018-10-19 20:16:24 Yep, that's the ones!! OIL OIL OIL OIL BILLIONS BILLIONS BILLIONS BILLIONS..... what Yemen children, what journalist, what 911, what what what what????
8619 2018-10-19 20:16:16 Yeah Bush lied to get us into Iraq aka Oil war

Don't worry, Obama got old Bin huh < Wink!!!
8620 2018-10-19 20:16:06 This was like watching the scene in Idiocracy where Luke Wilson is trying to explain that they should put water on plants instead of Gatorade.  “ITS GOT ELECTROLYTES!!!!”  Keep peddling that snake oil, Chuck.
8621 2018-10-19 20:15:53 if we nationalize oil in the US(like most producers world wide) we could bring Russia and Saudi arabia  to heel, by forcing the price per barrel into the cellar. that would be leadership.
8622 2018-10-19 20:15:53 Castor oil smells so disgusting I legit can’t use it no more
8623 2018-10-19 20:15:52 LoL..'add oil' will  appear in the dictionary，And I believe 'overdoes' would be in too .like the mayor of 'makham'@frankscarpitti said that ：they can't even spell markham right .They make western democracy ridiculous。
8624 2018-10-19 20:15:52 Definitely do the oil change first lol
8625 2018-10-19 20:15:49 I work in the oil field.... 

And yes, but here's the catch, the ones i referred to in last tweet, didn't learn Spanish because, get this, their parents thought they should learn English since they came to America.... Crazy i know!
8626 2018-10-19 20:15:46 The CEO’s of the major oil co pansies supported it, NASA supports it, the Economic Nobel prize winner proved it works, but a bible school dropout doesn’t like it so it must be bad. 
8627 2018-10-19 20:15:45 Trying out some fish oil to see if it'll improve my brain a bit. I just wish these pills weren't so big and hard to swallow.
8628 2018-10-19 20:15:41 SCARY ATTACK ON SOCIAL MEDIA & TECH. BEWARE
@tedcruz thinks Social Media & Tech Companies demonstrate political bias skewing & silencing the voices off those they disagree with. "They are bigger than ATT & Standard Oil when they were broken up by antitrust laws."@realDonaldTrump
8629 2018-10-19 20:15:38 Do they allow palm oil in Santorini??
8630 2018-10-19 20:15:27 I’m right there with you. My knees were killing me. I started taking CBD oil. The results are amazing. I feel 20 years younger. Stairs are no longer a problem.
8631 2018-10-19 20:15:22 Quinoa and kale with garlic and sesame oil. Seriously, don't bother.
8632 2018-10-19 20:15:20 Ghana jollof that'll use oil to kill person 
8633 2018-10-19 20:15:18 The OPL245 deal is the biggest fraud committed against the people of Nigeria by Shell, Agip, Dan Etete and Goodluck Jonathan by dishing out an Oil Well worth $630 Billion sold for $1.1 Billion and the money shared between a few people with nothing left for the massed. Very bad
8634 2018-10-19 20:15:10 Damn.. oil aint coming til monday!! 
8635 2018-10-19 20:15:08 You should read the article. The Statscan figures are national. C.D. Howe found the negative numbers were focused on the oil patch and the rest of he economy grew. So not diffuse enough to be a recession.
8636 2018-10-19 20:15:02 Digging an oil field in this store is prohibited!
店内で油田を掘るのは禁止です！
8637 2018-10-19 20:14:53 He still has that sweet baby hair. I bet he has a velvety line of peachy new hair fuzz at his hairline too. Puberty will kill it stone dead with the oil and the courseness but for now that’s an epic Baby Prince Charming vibe .
8638 2018-10-19 20:14:26 I have always wondered, the obsession we Zims have with (refined) cooking oil. Some will even break limbs just to get hold of that "precious" but deadly commodity.
8639 2018-10-19 20:14:18 "The phoniest and whitest things in the world cannot be cuddled or even cuddled - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
8640 2018-10-19 20:13:57 I am not a "Lib", I am an Independent Trump supporter who is fed up with the Fallin Failure and watching oil and gas get a free ride in Oklahoma while the schools suffer. 

You really want to talk about slimy campaigns? Stitt has been the worst of the mud slingers .
8641 2018-10-19 20:13:51 #COT = spec book for #oil as of 10/16/18, net long 493,229; change of 34,822 or 6.59% down from prev. 528,051; 66.73% of 739,097 max on 2/6/18
8642 2018-10-19 20:13:41 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasTownHall
8643 2018-10-19 20:13:41 Me and @Heid_oil just listened to your podcast.
Love the banter and the insight into different stocks and your thinking behind their potential
Keep up the good podcast work

8644 2018-10-19 20:13:39 Countries like the UK and Germany have had their guns removed. Now their Government and , and does, anything they want at the expense of their citizens. They are being paid off by the likes of Soros and Oil Wealthy Islamists. #NoGunsNoPower!
8645 2018-10-19 20:13:38 Worse Trump already indicated that they will do nothing First because of oil then he said they going to sell 4 hundred billion  $$$of weapons to evil Saudi Arabia
8646 2018-10-19 20:13:35 Hoping Tesla or something like it can replace oil asap... Have to try. I agree changes are coming and cities may well go under... Saudi knows their oil will be worth nothing in future... That's why prices are so high now
8647 2018-10-19 20:13:31 Buddy, please don't vote based on this propaganda flyer, or this idea that 112 threatens our access to oil&gas, both are wildly incorrect.
8648 2018-10-19 20:13:12 Groundnut oil.
8649 2018-10-19 20:13:04 I didn't know death was part. But no it's not extreme. I'm killing myself in school here to get this oil money and somebody just wants to make it easy, sharp sharp. They should all die 
8650 2018-10-19 20:12:59 Five Guys only use peanut oil for their fries. Er ... no thanks
8651 2018-10-19 20:12:58 リクエストは受け付けないぜ！
8652 2018-10-19 20:12:41 Bio Oil! Won’t help you fit into your pants lol, but it helps with the stretch marks!
8653 2018-10-19 20:12:39 Got some CBD oil to see if it would help with my anxiety but I just ate all the cheese in the fridge and fell asleep at 6pm? Idk could be unrelated.
8654 2018-10-19 20:12:39 In fact is not that, the problem is Venezuelan oil
8655 2018-10-19 20:12:30 Venezuela was hit by its over dependence on oil as the single contributor to its fiscus and GDP. When oil prices dipped,  its economy screamed resulting in massive loss of jobs, high inflation and chronic shortages. Zimbabwe disturbed it's major economic driver, agriculture.
8656 2018-10-19 20:12:12 Liberals would love nothing more than to have us wind up having a bad relationship with Saudi Arabia. They are anti-oil and they know if we do, it will mess with oil supply and price. They'd really love it to happen under Trump so they could blame him in hopes of gaining votes
8657 2018-10-19 20:11:54 So I got new argon oil shampoo and Jamaican black castor oil today. Used it when I got home. My beard has flourished. More volume and soft as fuck. Wow.
8658 2018-10-19 20:11:52 That is not what consultation is. All Albertans have the opportunity to provide input to public consultations, not just those naive enough to buy the snake oil Kenney is selling.
8659 2018-10-19 20:11:40 NoooOooOoOooOoOoO.
8660 2018-10-19 20:11:38 Koch brothers do it before  election happens,!! Like Trump is scooping up all the environmental judges and attorneys just in case of another oil disaster, like #BP, Who found and left another 10,000,000 gallons of oil on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico,!!
8661 2018-10-19 20:11:28 Is Jamaican castor oil really good for your hair? The internet told me it helps your hair grow. My damaged ass hair is desperate
8662 2018-10-19 20:11:24 @IcelandFoods thank you so much for taking a stand and starting the process of removing palm oil from your products!! Huge respect to you, I hope #ASDA #Tesco #Lidl #aldi #morrisons #sainsbury follow suit!! #PalmOil
8663 2018-10-19 20:11:07 How come the drop in FX reserve despite rise oil price?
8664 2018-10-19 20:11:01 Barryroe is an appraisal programme (with additional exploration of the deeper sands). 6 wells have already been drilled with oil flowing to the surface, 3-4000bopd in the case of the last drill).
8665 2018-10-19 20:10:46 pause the discourse for a minute but what are y’all thoughts on truffles/truffle oil?
8666 2018-10-19 20:10:43 I don't even have a lamp oil to lose, but i've still decided that im the king!
8667 2018-10-19 20:10:28 과감하게 그토록 원했던 하급생 교복 팔고 지금 옷 산건데 하급생 교복 1도 안 그립다
8668 2018-10-19 20:10:23 The fact that he said free oil change you can change your oil yourself and literally almost everywhere they do free tire rotation 
8669 2018-10-19 20:10:20 マテウス、あのおねーさんよくね？
8670 2018-10-19 20:10:09 "So Ryan, I got Hooters as a sponsor...girls, chicken wings....and you got, what, like oil?"
8671 2018-10-19 20:10:04 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
8672 2018-10-19 20:10:04 Endless oil story
8673 2018-10-19 20:10:03 wow i really just got an oil change & tire for FREE. today a good day & im treating myself to steak tonight 
8674 2018-10-19 20:09:54 Already been discovered, some have been created but the oil industry won't let us evolve from gas engines because they make trillions off oil
8675 2018-10-19 20:09:53 -So what do you have for me?
-Take a pot, at least 3l, put either olive oil or lard to melt down to cover the bottom. Then you will need 500gr of paprika, red is preferred but you can manage with other sorts. Put it in there to simmer and release water, then add 300gr of tomato.
8676 2018-10-19 20:09:49 In fact, there was that one time my ex-husband told me not to change my own oil, then bought a bag of kitty litter for the inevitable.
8677 2018-10-19 20:09:42 I'd love to stop importing oil. You know what a great solution to that is? Green energy.
8678 2018-10-19 20:09:31 Do we go though with the arms sale?

Do we keep importing their oil?

We can easily buy more oil from Canada or Mexico — our real allies. Or even conserve.
8679 2018-10-19 20:09:18 An oil painting would be more effective in the WH.
8680 2018-10-19 20:09:18 Idiot. If CIA clearly declared that Iran is behind 9/11 and they now pushed all countries to stop buying thier Oil due to their support for terrorisim. Wake up
8681 2018-10-19 20:09:17 Nope, US is a net exporter now in oil. in just a few years the cost of per barrel will go down to 60-70 USD domestic as technology for extracting from shale continues to decrease. The reason why oil has risen lately is because Saudi Arabia has decreased production.
8682 2018-10-19 20:09:16 I just let mine look like I’m homeless. But realistically, I just use beard oil. Makes everything look better. #WorstBeardOnTwitch = me
8683 2018-10-19 20:09:11 Askari Cement is now owned by the Fauji Foundation, among the largest business conglomerates in Pakistan; cement, fertilizer, oil & gas, banking, insurance, food amd retail. The Foundation's purpose is charitable work such as hospitals and schools
8684 2018-10-19 20:09:04 Good luck with that.  We have bowed down to the Saudis since oil was discovered in the desert.

8686 2018-10-19 20:08:52 Cooking oil is secondary. Health is more important than cooking oil
8687 2018-10-19 20:08:47 FUN FACT 6:
Did you know that oil pipelines vandalism or sabotage is an offence in Nigeria punishable with 
either a prison term of not more than 21 years, or death? 
Isn’t death kinda extreme?
@HDS_18
@moshthe_man
8688 2018-10-19 20:08:37 And we've been in bed with the Saudis for how long? Way the hell before we started selling them the arms to destroy Yemen. Look folks, our entire civilization is based on oil. It can only end, not get cleaner and kinder. Sorry.
8689 2018-10-19 20:08:33 For my almost bald ass chickas. Take a glass bottle fill this with REAL olive oil and cut a little garlic.. en doe dit in de fles en laat dit 24 uur in trekken
8690 2018-10-19 20:08:25 Every #craftbeer festival smells like weed and beard oil.
8691 2018-10-19 20:08:18 The Franklin coach, who is also Haynes' dad, said he's out and injuries are a big part of the opt out. He is quoted on both things in the Oil City paper lol.
8692 2018-10-19 20:08:05 I love coming to get my car serviced at the dealership but be pissed when they tell me some thing is wrong with my car  girl just do my oil and let me go!
8693 2018-10-19 20:08:04 Would be a completely different roster if the Oil never won the lottery..
8694 2018-10-19 20:08:04 "...reported died in a car crash." Hmmm. That gives the phrase "vehicular homicide" a new meaning. If there's an uptick in fiery car crashes caused by broken oil, gas or brake lines in Saudi...
8695 2018-10-19 20:07:56 Getting diesel from shale oil is more of a pain in the butt and with the geopolitical shift globally, we may see that it is far more profitable to sell overseas and use solar power (with gasoline or diesel as a secondary source).
8696 2018-10-19 20:07:47 Oh he will.  They probably painted that beautiful trim w/ oil based paint. And seriously, a Pergola on a 1912 vintage home?  The designer in me is screaming.
8697 2018-10-19 20:07:33 Bollox. Palm oil and wood.
8698 2018-10-19 20:07:03 Not unless you do 5 quarts of synthetic oil for $20
8699 2018-10-19 20:06:55 Big up dj wats all the way from the oil city Hoima
8700 2018-10-19 20:06:49 Did you forget about my infamous focaccia, Meechelle 
Oil. On. Oil.
8701 2018-10-19 20:06:14 They aren't.  The majority are headed here and the ones that cross illegally will pay thousands to do it. NOBODY gets across without paying.
8702 2018-10-19 20:06:11 The Saudis are looking at CNY oil?
8703 2018-10-19 20:06:06 No, at the price of money.

They offer a service in exchange for money. There's no harm in that.

It's exactly the same as a masseuse who rubs your shoulders or the mechanic who changes your oil.
8704 2018-10-19 20:06:05 EYELASHES

Grow them with:
-Castor oil
-Lash growing serum 
-Olive oil 
-Vaseline
-Coconut oil 

-Never go to sleep with mascara on.
8705 2018-10-19 20:05:47 It’s one of the best music documentaries ever. In my top 3 with Oil City Confidential & Anvil!
8706 2018-10-19 20:05:30 A fair point. The price of oil, mostly, has little to do with inflation when it comes to volatility. It's any excuse they can get away with, until the mkt crashes. But, I'd point out that the cost of Saudi oil, fracked oil, North Sea oil, etc have different real costs to extract.
8707 2018-10-19 20:05:17 Of course, we are in the age were Nigerians are clamoring for a blue economy I.e an economy that advocates better stewardship of the ocean and its resources I find it hilarious because some Nigerians still engage in oil bunkering which is the child of oil spillage.
8708 2018-10-19 20:05:12 EYEBROWS

Grow them with:
-Vaseline
-Olive oil
-Castor oil
-Coconut oil (my personal fave)
-Get them waxed monthly
8709 2018-10-19 20:05:10 Stop buying bear n buy something useful, like cooking oil.
8710 2018-10-19 20:04:59 As PTF chairman,  he spent 70% of PTF budget on the north. As two time petroleum minister he ensured oil producing states are under developed. What else does he want? Maybe when he starts pissing crude oil then he can use the money to clean out the mess he caused in Niger delta
8711 2018-10-19 20:04:53 Before tatsvaga zvakawanda mune cooking oil here
8712 2018-10-19 20:04:45 19 of 21 9/11 hijackers came from Saudi Arabia? No accountability? Seemingly, US leaders have a hard time standing up to Saudi's? Oil & a few $'s shouldn't compromise our principles, where is our light? POTUS must act, failure to do so will hurt him more then he realizes, I pray
8713 2018-10-19 20:04:43 How does Chinese GDP and oil prices fit into this?
8714 2018-10-19 20:04:43 The fool. How does that look like a gate?  them no even know what a gate looks like
8715 2018-10-19 20:04:25 Bring oil to the pple what's all this we saw tankers of fuel but no fuel in service stations now factories are full of stocks while in shops shelves are empty
8716 2018-10-19 20:04:24 If you really want to rock a epsom salt cleanse, drink a big jar of half grapefruit and half olive oil before going to sleep.  Lay on you liver side and you will clean out your liver.
8717 2018-10-19 20:04:10 I cut them up with some smoked salmon, drizzle with Brain Octane Oil and sea salt and that is lunch... I also slice them on grass-fed beef patties as part of my dinner. #Avocado
8718 2018-10-19 20:04:00 waiting til Friday afternoon to get my oil changed wasn’t the best decision

8722 2018-10-19 20:03:40 Yes, because no one ever flies and doing so negates the entire big oil disinformation campaign and ecological destruction over decades upon decades. (Were there a high speed train up and down the west coast like there should be, you know where I’d be.)
8723 2018-10-19 20:03:40 Where do you check the oil on a Land Rover...on your driveway 
8724 2018-10-19 20:03:29 Apply avacado oil or tee tree oil every night before sleeping. It really helps alot you can get these from the bodyshop
8725 2018-10-19 20:03:26 No matter where I go my oil change be almost 70 dollars
8726 2018-10-19 20:03:19 Reduce fuel levies to absorb the rising global oil prices

8730 2018-10-19 20:02:56 “Alright sir, your next oil change is going to be at 784,631 miles...”

“You mean 84,000, right?”

“Uhh no, you have 777,000 miles on your vehicle and the oil change interval is 5000 miles, which will put you at 783,000.”

8731 2018-10-19 20:02:55 Whoever my husband is, I hope you can handle oil changes and tires bc I can’t be sitting in this shop for this long for the rest of my life

8734 2018-10-19 20:02:43 Wait a minute he said our law enforcement were the new jim crow -say impeach Pres Trump then says he will work with him then threatens to impeach again - he is a snake oil sales man- tells u what he thinks u want to hear to manipulate ur vote. Wake up ppl!
8735 2018-10-19 20:02:29 FUN FACT 5:
Did you know that similar to the explosion of the Osisioma pipeline in Abia State this month, a 
pipeline exploded near Lagos in 2004 while thieves tried to siphon oil from it?

8739 2018-10-19 20:01:51 You are a con man. Snake oil salesman. You wish to sell out Flordians to Socialism which is the poor man's substitution to what really works which is capitalism. Capitalism makes countries prosper. Socialism makes everyone poor. We don't want to all be equally poor.

8746 2018-10-19 20:01:24 I've been talking to larger real estate investors - completely hands off on alberta real estate right now - beginning to see real affects of no pipeline and future of the oil economy in AB - waiting to see what next rate hike does - long term fine but short term may get worse
8747 2018-10-19 20:01:20 Check their play in the oil sector. As a matter of fact, per capita, they floor us big time. We can't always win. It's abt us giving our best shots. We lose some, we win some. I see your point, but not in this case. Valid points can be lost in wrong context, like here.
8748 2018-10-19 20:01:17 There will be no compromise of the EU's basic principles to suit a departing member. You lied to the electorate, colluded in electoral fraud & then bought £70,000 worth of gold to protect yourself from the fall in the £. No reason for the EU to compromise w snake oil vendors.

8750 2018-10-19 20:00:52 Are we just gonna brush over the fact that the calr•i•ty cleanser has hemp oil in it
8751 2018-10-19 20:00:51 Texas oil is low sulfur and superior to the high sulfur Saudi oil, yet our refineries are built for Saudi oil. We export our oil and import theirs rather than building new refineries. Now, they’re threatening to raise prices.
8752 2018-10-19 20:00:44 We'd be happy with global oil prices, but we are not getting them because we cannot sell because we don't have enough pipelines because you and yours, including Notley, are idiots and dangerous religious maniacs.
8753 2018-10-19 20:00:38 Who do you think has funded Wahhabi inspired terrorist groups and sympathetic preachers for decades? Islamist murder gangs did not exist before the Saudis started spreading their oil wealth to their favoured groups.
8754 2018-10-19 20:00:34 Week, 10 days
8755 2018-10-19 20:00:27 No problem, I think you can, best going for zinsser 123, it's waterbased so dry in 30 mins, oil based 1 is horrendous smell to it. I think 1l off zinsser123 is about £15
8756 2018-10-19 20:00:25 This is so goddamn beautiful your oil paintings look so good they're so inspiring!!!
8757 2018-10-19 20:00:19 Change my oil tomorrow?

8760 2018-10-19 19:59:47 The only reason they’re behind is cuz India is not an oil/gas producer. All producing countries are higher, due to upgraders, processing plants, trucking, etc. Hardly a fair comparison.
8761 2018-10-19 19:59:47 No kidding.  I was expecting his isolationism to be a disaster, but he's managed to get some good done with his rhetoric.  And if he manages to disarm North Korea, split up the EU, and get Europe off Russian oil and natural gas, it'll be a solid win.
8762 2018-10-19 19:59:37 I'm here all day every day so I can feel the chill. Glad I got oil today. First fill since March.
8763 2018-10-19 19:59:34 Oil and Gas prices tanked, lumber prices same, BC real estate slowing, AB real estate next to zero bid. All good.
8764 2018-10-19 19:59:29 Sunflower seed oil is rly good for ur hair & skin :•)
8765 2018-10-19 19:59:26 Um, Trump was a Democrat too, until he realized the party wouldn’t drink the snake oil. Took a move to the Gullible Old Party.
8766 2018-10-19 19:59:18 Democrats are cheering them on. 
No better optics for them than if Trump does call out the Guard and pics of armed Guardsmen facing down women holding babies surface.
8767 2018-10-19 19:59:14 This week turned out to be a bad draw for the American Markets. Can't the week ahead with earnings change the dynamic and concerns about yields, globalization and oil? Hope so... #Finance
8768 2018-10-19 19:59:01 - Oil your hair 2-5 times a month to promote hair growth and strong, shiny hair. 
- don’t wear tight hair styles often 
- brush your hair at least once a day 
- use a good and reliable shampoo and conditioner 
- use a hair mask once a month
8769 2018-10-19 19:58:54 About to have to turn my phone of for a flight (yes, irony, etc) but just to say I agree with Silvio and think the oil industry should be a) not trusted to put forward policy solutions and b) prosecuted for their crimes. That’s not a culture war. It’s justice.
8770 2018-10-19 19:58:52 Congress can encourage renewable and low carbon energy projects by exempting them from the passive activity loss rules, just as oil and gas projects are
8771 2018-10-19 19:58:42 *me putting a tablespoon of tea tree oil shampoo lather directly into my open eyeball* 

Lol yum zesty
8772 2018-10-19 19:58:38 Finally getting my oil changed . I feel like a big girl now 
8773 2018-10-19 19:58:31 Back massages with oil, keep that skin moisturized.
8774 2018-10-19 19:58:31 We tried 10X a year ago but only had 10-20kb DNA at the time. Getting HMW DNA out of this oil dripping dank plant has been real a bummer man!
We’re now getting 50kb-80kb material. Need some whale hunters to look at hemp oil:)
8775 2018-10-19 19:58:25 Let’s stop referring to them as Royalty - like all the Middle East oil rich countries they are led by family dictatorships - billionaire pariahs
8776 2018-10-19 19:58:13 I’m confused here. Nothing protects consumers from Big Oil passing on this expense to us, and I don’t think this bill addresses the reduction in emissions, on which our survival depends. So why do you support it? Your views usually seem based on deeper truths than this.
8777 2018-10-19 19:58:08 Ppl who stuck a #NOon112 yardsign between my screen & door can eat my a$$. I'll be voting #YESon112 & u can take ur oil/gas/fracking garbage & shove it! #copolitics #JaredPolis @PolisForCO #RenewableEnergy NOW! No good choices, Polis gas industry puppet, Stapelton hates education
8778 2018-10-19 19:57:59 Lol some people go years without changing the oil and I’m like dafuq?!
8779 2018-10-19 19:57:58 There are some homes like mine in North Texas that were damaged by fracking earthquakes caused by the oil and gas industry and her husband votes for their greed laden agenda.  It isn't covered because who thinks of getting earthquake insurance in of all places Texas.
8780 2018-10-19 19:57:57 Babe ur head get oil jare
8781 2018-10-19 19:57:49 jaribu the Anointing Oil.

8783 2018-10-19 19:57:20 Like what happened to the $30 oil change????? Did I miss them shit
8784 2018-10-19 19:57:14 FUN FACT 4:
Did you know that oil spills due to crude oil theft and sabotage of oil and gas facilities cause 
the most damage to the environment from oil and gas operations?
8785 2018-10-19 19:57:13 No, it’s looks like it’s a battery chicken and full of water and other shit. Cook a free range one yersen just stick it in an oven with oil and salt and pepper, tastes 25 times better than that crap. Peace 
8786 2018-10-19 19:56:59 Jeeps have sturdy bumpers so us short girls can stand on it to pour in the oil  #jeepprobs #climbingmyjeepinskinnyjeans
8787 2018-10-19 19:56:58 The PMB-led government is doing this despite oil prices being half of what it was during the PDP era. This same government paid Nigeria Airways pensioners after decades of neglect. All with the little we have. This is what you get when those in power are not thieves.
8788 2018-10-19 19:56:57 Well done Gloria keep the fight g oil g but look after yourself as well x
8789 2018-10-19 19:56:40 Big Oil has literally fought climate change action and pushed junk science for decades, man! 

The severity of climate change as it stands now is *directly* tied to that industry. That's a conspiracy, 1000%
8790 2018-10-19 19:56:40 Does my sassiness upset you? Why are you beset with gloom? Cause I walk like I've got oil wells pumping in my living room 
#MayaAngelou 
8791 2018-10-19 19:56:35 I’m gonna buy CBD oil tomorrow & im very excited cause I’ve wanted it for so long, hope it helps my wee brain chill oot
8792 2018-10-19 19:56:23 It is apparently enough of a concern that oil companies want to eliminate the risk
8793 2018-10-19 19:56:23 Oil and gas companies are some of the most profitable and need ZERO help from tax payers.
8794 2018-10-19 19:56:22 Okay then just massage oil, hands and fingers it is 
8795 2018-10-19 19:56:05 Hey look we agree. It will be clean energy’s technological and economic superiority to fossil fuels, not the culture war against Big Oil, that will prevent growth of fossil consumption.
8796 2018-10-19 19:55:49 *more olive oil atop the mushroom to make it slide in*
8797 2018-10-19 19:55:47 The man hrs spent, the money spent, the human suffering, lives lost all because we have virtually no control over our southern border are incalculable.  
It's all politics folks.

8799 2018-10-19 19:55:37 Glad I dont vote conservative, however the current Gov's have completely screwed this legalization process. very little variety prices are 2 high things were better at the pot shops befor it became legal 40+ varieties pot 6 of hash $20 for 5 grams and $20 for cherry oil

8803 2018-10-19 19:55:21 We get most all our fuel from Canada anyway, plus we are setting on more oil than we can use.Time to switch to our own OIL!!! Be Blessed
8804 2018-10-19 19:55:13 Ha ha. So Aussies must be really confused by all this #CBD twitter traffic. It's hemp oil, helps with a lot of things. Don't know if it would good in hot sauce, but why not?
8805 2018-10-19 19:55:09 thanks to oil my High Div Port is down .35% but Div Growth Port is up .54% today
8806 2018-10-19 19:55:08 Syria lost its war on terrorism. It is Ruined.

Iraq lost as well & In Shambles.

Libya with all the oil reserves defeated by terrorism. 

Afghanistan till today gripped by terrorism. 

The only Army that beat terrorism is Pakistan. 

MAYBE THATS WHY THEY ARE BAD FOR SOME PEOPLE.
8807 2018-10-19 19:55:04 Congratulations on your Passing out my brother. Better late than never. Proud of you fam.
8808 2018-10-19 19:54:59 As wide as the oil price range can be?
8809 2018-10-19 19:54:57 lost the run of ourselves, race too hurried anyway, all to suit one man, & really he's too old(mibad), 3dragons a disgrace to themselves(for 3 dif' reasons), the poppy is out of season, and 'no oil painting' just ain't gonna sell well, yip, looks like he's back, 7yr zzzz....
8810 2018-10-19 19:54:52 Note to self: Don't put the washing liquid next to the cooking oil.....not having spag-bog the night.

8812 2018-10-19 19:54:49 The wonder bread bag and olive oil treatment would be too good for them... They need those "only scared little boys use guns this big" guns shoved up their ass's and pull the trigger.
8813 2018-10-19 19:54:43 Just found out the oil for my car is $80 per oil change WOOHOOOOOOOOOO today is gr8 :-))
8814 2018-10-19 19:54:36 Even just cooking them on a skillet without oil will crisp them up. 

But I feel obligated to point out: still not chilaquiles. So I’m not sure how this is relevant to the thread.
8815 2018-10-19 19:54:34 I am angry af
And it ain't nothing it ain't about money.
Bills are piling and rising like a helium balloon, caught another one in the mail this afternoon....meanwhile acct balance is far below sea level like it's prospecting for crude oil.
I'm mad af
8816 2018-10-19 19:54:15 Oil full ur head sir...
8817 2018-10-19 19:54:02 It takes a lot of patience and also maybe a trim at a barber who specializes in beards, you gotta condition it and maybe try our beard oil if it doesn’t fuck up your skin. This beard is about six months in from clean shaven at this point

8825 2018-10-19 19:53:19 The opening of the $6.3 billion STAR oil refinery by Azerbaijani investment is yet another success of Azerbaijan & Turkey, further boosting strategic ties between 2 brotherly states, which will bolster opportunities for diversification of mutual cooperation in economic  spheres.
8826 2018-10-19 19:53:19 Yeah, I saw all the oil tanks and stuff and it really looked industrial. The other side of the freeway is residential though.
8827 2018-10-19 19:53:17 Oil changed, car washed. Someone wanna fill my tank up for me?
8828 2018-10-19 19:53:15 I use coconut oil.
8829 2018-10-19 19:53:14 However, the NDP would happily import oil from the house of Saud then to develop the oil sands.  @theJagmeetSingh doesnt want to offend the few that oppose oil and oil pipelines in this great country.  #unreal #giveyourheadashake
8830 2018-10-19 19:53:14 Why are McDonald’s fries so damn good? I’m convinced they fry in cocaine oil! @mcdonalds I need answers
8831 2018-10-19 19:53:10 A large majority of fossil energy reserves are owned by governments. 90% of the growth in fossil energy consumption this century will come from poor countries. 

Climate change is not a conspiracy forced on us by Big Oil.
8832 2018-10-19 19:52:57 They're taking oil money. Can hardly say MCare4All wo choking. They're voting with the GOP in congress,just approved all the federal judges. Dem party=GOP party,only difference rhetoric. They'll screw u just as much as other guy
8833 2018-10-19 19:52:54 Oil rich.
8834 2018-10-19 19:52:47 You’re lying again, spanky don. Beto is the perfect candidate for Texas. Venezuela crashed because of falling oil prices. You’re trying to pretend that you didn’t say Lyin Ted was worthless and hasn’t done anything for Texas. That’s one of the very few times you told the truth.
8835 2018-10-19 19:52:46 Yes we import sunflower seeds, then manufacture the cooking oil
8836 2018-10-19 19:52:45 
8837 2018-10-19 19:52:39 At what point will they not be hypocrites though? How much composting and wool coats are required? If they have plastic shoes then what? No freedom of speech then? What if they only have the energy to fight one oil project right now?
8838 2018-10-19 19:52:39 Some oil type condom that protects you when you say "Buckingham".
8839 2018-10-19 19:52:17 tbh I’m so baffled that we all thought st Ives apricot scrub and coconut oil was good for your skin like wow
8840 2018-10-19 19:52:15 Without Trump’s new policies, this wouldn’t have happened. Onama’s regulations would have made it impossible. His oil Reg’s alone wld hve kept us dependent.
8841 2018-10-19 19:52:11 MIX SOME OLIVE OIL AND LEMON JUICE TOGETHER THEN SOAK YOUR FINGERS IN THE MIXTURE FOR ATLEAST 5 MINUTES THE VITIMIN C FROM THE LEMON HELPS GROW YOUR NAILS
8842 2018-10-19 19:52:05 FUN FACT 3:
Did you know that apart from the economic setbacks resulting from oil pipelines sabotage, loss 
of human and marine life, and environmental damage are the most daunting effects?
8843 2018-10-19 19:52:02 Thanks Glen. I'll have five drops of CBD oil in my cappucino please.
8844 2018-10-19 19:51:35 You can go into real estate, start small, rent or buy  apartments then rent it out, it will generate monthly income. (2) agroallied. (3) oil
8845 2018-10-19 19:51:32 Typical snake oil salesman!
8846 2018-10-19 19:51:16 @TheJohnSenning Organic pumpkin puree (find it in the pie filling aisle) and coconut oil takes care of hard kaka in your doggie's bowel. Just a little on their food. The s*** I know. #NoPurina
8847 2018-10-19 19:51:13 High taxes for consumers, because if it pass the oil companies will past the cost to consumer's. Why others pollutes are except of the cleaning tax?
8848 2018-10-19 19:51:13 Oil spill tonight 
8849 2018-10-19 19:50:58 I’m glad you live in an idealistic world. I live in a different one where the oil industry has been waging the precise battles you say aren’t happening, for decades.
8850 2018-10-19 19:50:49 BLACK FKING OIL PEOPLE
8851 2018-10-19 19:50:44 When they suggest bullshit stuff at a basic oil change appointment... STAHP! 
8852 2018-10-19 19:50:42 Yam and palm oil sauzz
8853 2018-10-19 19:50:41 So we dont import any ingredient for making cooking oil? I doubt ... We definitely do... i will ask @Busisa74
8854 2018-10-19 19:50:38 Before we can even test petrol integrity, the NNPC has to really monitor the movement of petroleum products, oil bunkering leads to black market which leads to sale across border ,which leads to untested petroleum products because vandals can not have better refineries than NNPC
8855 2018-10-19 19:50:36 Ted Cruz is a CORPORATE SELLOUT  receiving over $2,000,000 million by oil corporations to help destroy Texas, our planet, and deny the American future of clean water, air, and power. That is why he does not deserve your vote. He refuses to acknowledge facts for MONEY.
8856 2018-10-19 19:50:33 Oil sees bounce on Saudi concerns but suffers weekly drop
8857 2018-10-19 19:50:31 Yup. All I have left in my pocket is a bit of change. Thank you for leaving that behind....damn now that's gone too. Just like our oil industry, our pipelines our borders, our justice system, your ethics and our pride in our country. Now that's #RealChange
8858 2018-10-19 19:50:28 You keep harping on taxes, whats up with all d revenue we've generated thru crude oil & some of our natural resources, where's d infrastructure & wealth? Yet Nigeria is d world capital of poverty, if they could mismanage such humongous amount who told they wont do same to our tax
8859 2018-10-19 19:50:28  Well, he'd be working for snake oil salesmen.

8862 2018-10-19 19:50:20 Took the car in for an oil change this morning. Ended up getting a free lunch and and they washed it for me. Saved me a two trips today.
8863 2018-10-19 19:50:20 I do agree medical purposes should be considered as with cannabis oil here. But personally I don't agree with recreational use.
8864 2018-10-19 19:50:17 naaaaah can't ever be me...   . I just got a oil busy.
8865 2018-10-19 19:50:13 I hate when they forget to put oil and vinegar on my sandwhich
8866 2018-10-19 19:50:08 I have no cubes no oil and no coins this will be fun.
8867 2018-10-19 19:50:01 Trump and his supporters are delusional. 
He is a snake oil salesman as you suggest, but his non-thinking supporters keep buying the snake oil.
8868 2018-10-19 19:49:47 Close hermz now no oil pass ...this is order guys take it and re sale
8869 2018-10-19 19:49:46 Trudeau came to lead right after our oil and gas sector bottomed out, we had a disproportionate dependance on that sector. Trudeau did not inherit a good situation at all and now we're excelling. That is relevant.
8870 2018-10-19 19:49:44 I used to love the biriyanis back in the day with dalda. Ipo I still prefer biriyani with veg oil over ghee (though unhealthy)
8871 2018-10-19 19:49:41 Scott's investments in corporations that do business with or are regulated by the state he governs, besides SunPass, involve health care, a high-speed rail system, a natural gas pipeline, prescription drugs, mosquito control and an oil services company.
8872 2018-10-19 19:49:37 Bit ironic that the UAE, the home of the Gulf News had an Israeli company fly in, design and install the whole security system covering the border, oil, gas, highways and cities from 2008-2015.
8873 2018-10-19 19:49:12 <オイルをぶっかけオイルをぶっかけられヌタヌタのヌラヌラのテカテカにしたろか?
8874 2018-10-19 19:49:05 LIES  LIES  Just check the law suite the AG has filed.  Please people check this stuff out....Trump is a good snake oil salesman or con artist.  Check facts, see what the Rep congress is trying to pass, you may take a step back very fast.
8875 2018-10-19 19:48:39 I heard if you kiss a UNN girl it will be tasting red oil from the previous okpa #UNIZIKvsUNN #UNNvsUNIZIK
8876 2018-10-19 19:48:33 Beto 3 bills compared to Cruz 30 w/ same time in office. Beto part of #ResistanceRises would be horrible for #Texas. Taking our tax cuts away plus raising taxes x3.  Tax barrel oil another 10$ /.24 tax hike at gas pump. Sending middle class to poor house.
8877 2018-10-19 19:48:29 Commodities update:
Gold: -0.04%
Silver: +0.31%
WTI crude: +0.93%
Brent oil: +0.86%
8878 2018-10-19 19:48:27 According to the Warren paper, Haynes is supposed to play. I think the big reason Warren and Franklin aren't in the playoffs is because they both were annihilated by GM and Oil City.
8879 2018-10-19 19:48:02 I think you should learn to read before you type, maybe even have a look at how many US troops and american oil workers are in saudi and across the causeway in Bahrain. If you read before you opened your cockhole you would see I am very much against the terrorists
8880 2018-10-19 19:48:01 Excuse me, #AgentOrange, what do YOU know about the great state and the people of Texas? We’re more than cowboys and horses and oil, but you wouldn’t know that, would you? #proudlesbiantexan y que?
8881 2018-10-19 19:47:48 Look at the oil and gas girls complaining wow.
8882 2018-10-19 19:47:46 I was simplifying, but Europe and Japan do not have plenty of oil, and we're tied into their economies pretty significantly.
8883 2018-10-19 19:47:24 it was great. Added some sunflower oil and honey. Sounds weird i know, but it all kept the pork from being too dry, like it can.
8884 2018-10-19 19:47:21 Chef McElroy cut up some bars of soap, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was veal, along with cheese.
8885 2018-10-19 19:47:12 Oil does not constantly flow through the pipelines. So an insider gives information as to what time crude oil will pass and these interferences get ready to tap. It's not everytime the acts are violent.
8886 2018-10-19 19:47:02 No scares,
No redness,
It’s not even shiny with oil... LOL
8887 2018-10-19 19:46:51 And if you want to talk about wars and Big Oil we can go there but I don’t really think you do.
8888 2018-10-19 19:46:50 I did that once after using kitty litter to pick up a ton of engine oil after my buddy spilled about 15 quarts changing his truck’s oil.
8889 2018-10-19 19:46:48 Oil or try draining some blood
8890 2018-10-19 19:46:47 Democrats want your tax dollars to go to education, healthcare, and solving environmental issues. 
Republicans want your tax dollars to go to corporate and oil tax subsidies, the military industrial complex and the private prison system.
 I know where my vote is going. #FBR #MAGA
8891 2018-10-19 19:46:44 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
8892 2018-10-19 19:46:28 I’m diffusing frankincense for the first time. I feel both older and wiser. My house smells like a fancy shop. Next time adding an oil to feel younger, but I’ll keep the wise, tyvm. #essentialoils #YoungLiving
8893 2018-10-19 19:46:27 Don't be condescending and call me sweetie. They make all of those products with oil we have in reserves and oil that is shipped by other methods like using the pipeline we already have.

8899 2018-10-19 19:46:10 Did he warn about the dangers of having & assisting a brother with a black arms supply chain to overthrow oil fields in the middle east.

People ought not do that ether.
8900 2018-10-19 19:46:10 We’ve spent decades pressuring big oil to give up their business of destroying communities and the planet. They are now using cynical political tactics to try protect themselves. There’s no inconsistency in exposing and opposing that.
8901 2018-10-19 19:46:06 This is unfortunately not how to calculate oil revs. Fiscal oil is not simply calculated like this.

Lool
8902 2018-10-19 19:46:03 It’s a website you can use to clean glass and mop up oil

8911 2018-10-19 19:45:29 That area isn’t really brushy. That’s a good 1/4 North of the mountain. That’s mostly farm land, oil rigs, and open ground where they store oil equipment
8912 2018-10-19 19:45:28 The main thing the liberals have done is destroy our oil industry which has stymied our economy and plummeted our dollar. That has really affected my life.
8913 2018-10-19 19:45:24 What happened to Olivine cooking oil, did they stop producing or not just producing enough?
8914 2018-10-19 19:45:12 You might have a point if we weren't selling them billions and billions in weapons, protecting them with our bases, supporting war in Yemen, and 15 of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 weren't SA, and OBL wasn't from there, and buying their oil, etc.
8915 2018-10-19 19:45:08 Well - it was broadcast in all media that the past Mexican potus told trump the con he would NOT say that Mexico would pay for wall as trump requested. Trump is a pathological liar and snake oil salesman. FT

8923 2018-10-19 19:44:12 FYI Buhari doesnt determine the price of oil and the forces of Demand and Supply are responsible for price. If you pay attention to fact you would also find it was a global drop in price, so much that big oil companies had to let go of staff

8927 2018-10-19 19:43:32 Looks like I'm going to spend six hours today using Photoshop's spot healer to erase Every. Single. Grain. Of. Dust. in my oil painting.

I hate this part of the process.  It's dull, painstaking, repetitive, and my hand cramps up after a few hours of clutching my tablet stylus.
8928 2018-10-19 19:43:19 It’s lack of civic sense . Railway is not at fault ! Same as people rushing to steal oil from overturned oil truck ! Same as metal wire use for flying kite during Basant in Lahore !

He gave this offer in a meeting with Fawad Hussain in Islamabad today (Friday).
8934 2018-10-19 19:42:55  Kudos, but I’ve never hated anyone in my life, however I truly despise leftist/socialist policies and will argue against them for the rest of my life. Half my family works in the oil biz and I personally know 10 or 12 owners. Never met a liberal oilman or woman.

8942 2018-10-19 19:42:06 The police should take immediate action to refrain the sell of cooking oil,l think it is creating  unnecessary public gatherings which are condemned at the moment considering that there is an outbreak of cholera in the country#cholera alert

8950 2018-10-19 19:41:31 You don't precipitously get snippy with the largest historic oil exporter on Earth unless you really have something to run on. Trump's not stupid, contrary to what much of the left would have us believe.

8954 2018-10-19 19:41:24 2) a genocidal autocrat who reigns over theocratic oil state. The Saudi ruling class was having an internal shakeup. MBS was supporting jihadis around the globe. And "curbing the downside" means stopping the genocide in Yemen, which Friedman hasn't called for.

8978 2018-10-19 19:39:16 Idk. I think it would be kinda weird to spend decades pressuring Big Oil to compromise on a carbon tax and then, when they do, act like enacting a carbon tax is “giving them a pass.”
8979 2018-10-19 19:39:14 On next month oil price will increase with 5-10%. America will increase proper oil output for decrease of effect of high oil prices on Russian economy. Initially 500 bpd from Saudi Arabia will be banned. Slowly America will occupy this volume.
8980 2018-10-19 19:39:11 47% ?  Nah sorry.  Don't believe that.  I remember doing these calcs for the now defunct Oil and Gas Offshore Supplies Office.  They're easily fudged. You add in things like the cost of the fuel to transport the turbines. Meaningless in reality.
8981 2018-10-19 19:39:11 If I win the Mega Millions grand prize tonight, I won’t even complain when they hit me with the whole “Sir we need to change every air filter in your car” nonsense when I get my oil changed tomorrow.

8991 2018-10-19 19:38:13 CBD oil can definitely help with both sleep and anxiety. Make sure you work on getting the dose right. Usually about half a dropper to start.

8995 2018-10-19 19:37:48 in the short term its a huge risk. Too many oil and water personalities. If it did work somehow would elevate them. if it doesn't work they can move off him real quick.
8996 2018-10-19 19:37:43 I support @YesOn1631. Big Oil doesn’t care about us and we don’t buy their BS about Initiative 1631 in Washington State. It’s time to hold Big Oil accountable. #YesOn1631 #waelex [Via @CivicAction]

8999 2018-10-19 19:37:32 No no, el petróleo de Venezuela ya es de la China, hace poco le dieron una cantidad de millones a Maduro, Venezuela sold 9.9 percent of joint venture to China oil firm: Maduro
9000 2018-10-19 19:37:26 Well.. .the article is suggesting it is based on their analysis of the number of stations and storage capacity, but I don't think that's credible.

Increased smuggling? Definitely. When N145 was close to landed cost there was less incentive, but with current oil price? Much more.

9015 2018-10-19 19:35:24 Like, what can we do really? 
Maybe even just sipping on oil with mayonnaise since you suggested unhealthy food.
9016 2018-10-19 19:35:22 After they transport the oil , they now make it into substandard petroleum products, like fuel, and my neighbor is wondering why is generator suddenly blew up! Lives are lost both at the scenes and outside the scenes of oil bunkering!
9017 2018-10-19 19:35:20 it really is just amazing to me how well the saudi government has gotten conservatives to approve of their regime. but where money and oil go, republicans follow, so am i really surprised?

9023 2018-10-19 19:34:40 I have my own in-house massage oil, which is in a container that is white, but under my lighting, looks exactly the same color as your registered red. We'll even say people come in to my shops and think, "Oh, that is (Professor Sunol's) massage oil." Infringing? 2/2
9024 2018-10-19 19:34:34 Respectfully, this kind of thing is what makes me thing many environmentalists are more interested in sustaining the culture war against Big Oil than in concrete policy accomplishments.
9025 2018-10-19 19:34:33 Someone put up a can of sardines not too long ago for those moments and i gave it a reluctant try... total winner! In olive oil only add salt n peppa
9026 2018-10-19 19:34:33 It's pretty straightforward: Oil contains carbon that isn't activley in the atmosphere. Using it puts carbon in the atmosphere. Using the things I listed plays with carbon that IS active in the carbon cycle already. That's why oil is worse.

9028 2018-10-19 19:34:03 Feel a #coldsore coming on? Dab the spot with tea tree oil, nail polish remover or even vodka....these can prevent it from blossoming
9029 2018-10-19 19:34:03 Poor lad. In the old days we used to rub oil of cloves (available at pharmacies) on the affected gum and tooth, or failing that, chew on whole cloves. Hope you won't be too tormented through the night.
9030 2018-10-19 19:34:00 Oh this question should have been Top of #MSM List when Bushes were in Office!  A—Hats!! Bushes are covered up with Saudi Ties!! OIL!! Try again!!!
9031 2018-10-19 19:33:58 The point is, we don't want your oil, and we don't need you.  Without our technology and spare parts, all you'll have are a rusty pile of planes in the desert.
9032 2018-10-19 19:33:46 I just bought some body oil that has me feeling like a new woman

9037 2018-10-19 19:33:23 Sadly It is estimated that between 200,000 and 300,000 barrels of oil is lost daily to theft, known in the country as illegal bunkering. The majority of the stolen crude oil is taken to large ocean-going tankers waiting offshore, which export the oil to foreign refineries.
9038 2018-10-19 19:33:20 c les fans le problème pour oil
9039 2018-10-19 19:33:14 Have you seen global oil prices? Our oil is currently selling for 30-25% of the current ‘Global’ price. That’s due to politics and that she does control.

Suppose you have a particular shade of red registered for massage oil. I operate a chain of (TOTALLY LEGIT) massage centers, and I always use very reddish light in them to set a mood. 1/2
9046 2018-10-19 19:32:07 Oh, who? Anypony I know? Ha ha, not miss Cloud Skimmer, right? They're both brutally honest about their...

Oh. It's either oil and water or a perfect match.

9048 2018-10-19 19:31:56 Insurance is not Health Care, just like Car Insurance does not get your oil changed, your tires replaced, or other repairs-- it's just isurance. Health Insurance which you can't afford the damn deductible, co-pay, or premium, does you little good, also.
9049 2018-10-19 19:31:54 The Death of Socrates is an oil on canvas painted by French painter Jacques-Louis David in 1787. The painting focuses on a classical subject like many of his works from that decade, in this case the story of the execution of Socrates as told by Plato in his Phaedo.

The net-long position was the least bullish in almost a year

9052 2018-10-19 19:31:32 I'll keep pushing for cheaper renewables and storage, along with expanded grid flexibility, rather than selling out to Big Oil. Call me principled.
9053 2018-10-19 19:31:29 @realDonaldTrump cant win on this.. if he listens to media he will get slammed on gas / oil prices.. if he does nothing dont care about humanity or freedom of speech and only thinking of his brand.. better to go with the 2nd part. do 1st part all america will feel it in pocket
9054 2018-10-19 19:31:19 Stupid? Arrogant more like. They know after a huff and a puff one hand will wash the other (arms deals and oil).
9055 2018-10-19 19:31:17 I think this is true, however, if Saudi Arabia decided to stop trading oil in USD, that could be the end of USD as the reserve currency—which in theory could be really bad. Putin would like it though.
9056 2018-10-19 19:31:11 @atiku No Stories; Prepare to meet the worst in Aso Rock but Nigerians want NO Stories... The hopes and aspiration of >180million people lies on the ATIKU/OBI ticket...NOOOO STORIES... whether oil price rise or fall..NOOO STORIESSSS
9057 2018-10-19 19:30:58 The government of Turkmenistan has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Jordin Sparks in a taffeta wig.
9058 2018-10-19 19:30:57 Do you think Trump is also betting that Saudi Arabia will now increase oil prosecution as part of this reciprocal transaction too?
9059 2018-10-19 19:30:56 Hallo x Soften your veg in a little oil before adding to slow cooker. Then coat the oxtail in flour, then fry until golden then add to cooker. They say you can bung it all in raw but doing this first adds flavour xx send us pics xx Add some dumplin too!
9060 2018-10-19 19:30:55 A tiny bit of peppermint oil (if you have any), turn off the lights, and if you can go somewhere where it's completely silent <3
9061 2018-10-19 19:30:45 Trouble and reality, must be based on citizens values. Oil is one such, yet it’s difficult to prescribe as a hazard. U will be told off quickly. Decision makers goes with what make political sensible for themselves. It’s the nature of politics

9068 2018-10-19 19:30:07 Cde,  don't be naive. Leave the citizens alone. These people are not fools. Why is it that they never used to queue for cooking oil like this earlier? That, which is making people now behave like this, is the real enemy. You honestly think people enjoy queues? Nxa!!!
9069 2018-10-19 19:30:07 may the hunters boil alive slowly in hot oil for eternity.

9077 2018-10-19 19:29:16 Of course it is! What makes it different? There are blasts? There is oil spillage? There is loss of economic gain? So what else are we looking for??
9078 2018-10-19 19:29:10 when i get big boy bread i'm gonna buy oral b or crest and make coconut oil the main ingredient in toothpaste
9079 2018-10-19 19:29:10 Here's an idea: Stop the oil and gas stuff and go for renewables, because short-term economic gains aren't worth vast swathes of the planet becoming uninhabitable or barely-habitable in our lifetime.
9080 2018-10-19 19:29:02 OH ITS COCONUT OIL LOL 
9081 2018-10-19 19:29:01 it's 3500 for the set (powder and oil)
9082 2018-10-19 19:28:44 Ruining the fun of oil hating!
9083 2018-10-19 19:28:39 You guys are terrific at offering these, I absolutely applaud you (you offered me a deal on a new battery when I once posted about those car woes).

I just got my oil changed right now, but thank you so much!
9084 2018-10-19 19:28:36 Good luck to the boys football team tonight as the quest for Lucas Oil begins! Do work! YOU GOTTA BELIEVE! @ShenandoahSport @Jordan_McCaslin
9085 2018-10-19 19:28:33 1st you’re the man for replying and 2nd you made my afternoon...you’re absolutely right and this is one of the reasons why I believe in the project as much as I do (and those connected to it). I see this time in history like oil, steel and electricity in impact. Make history MD
9086 2018-10-19 19:28:32 I was thinking don’t declare war on USSR at all go straight for the oil in 41. Kill off the UK. Sue for a period of white peace. Nuclear on all sides by 50s stalemate
9087 2018-10-19 19:28:26 Olive oil, and seasoning of your choice.   Sometimes I use a spicy seasoning.  Put in fridge wrapped up but make sure it’s out of fridge a good 45 mins before cooking
9088 2018-10-19 19:28:12 The sun is setting when an ordinary poor zimbo buys a mere 2l cooking oil at 15bugs. Surely the sun is setting when a national team is rewarded with cooking oil ko mabhuza anozopihwei?
9089 2018-10-19 19:28:02 I need a oil diffuser
9090 2018-10-19 19:28:00 I admire your lifestyle concerning veganism. But do you also try to avoid consuming palm oil taking in mind its negative effects on, among other things, rainforests?
9091 2018-10-19 19:28:00 Magnolia tissue oil, don't mix it with anything
9092 2018-10-19 19:27:56 To reject nuclear power and halt its development is to welcome climate change, in the current situation. Current and future technologies are the key to safely shift to cleaner energy sources whilst dodging the oil industry "energy shortage" fear-mongering.
9093 2018-10-19 19:27:55 I don't know that he should get Venezuela involved in this, being that they are one of our oil suppliers. He can talk all the crap he wants TX is done with #LyinTed #BetoForTexas #MoronInChief
9094 2018-10-19 19:27:53 Oil pulling works to clean teeth because the oil reacts with the alkalinity of saliva to produce soap in your mouth!  Olive oil and coconut oil inhibited the growth of S. mutans, the bacteria responsible for tooth decay.  Garlic will outright kill S. mutans.  #HealthTip

9096 2018-10-19 19:27:48 If you maintain the blade properly and cut with the muscle you won't snag. Sharpen and keep a little oil in your sheath to help lube the cut. Also who is Jake?
9097 2018-10-19 19:27:47 Yep, I got a call this morning that my car is ready to pick up, exactly 7 days after I dropped it off. The good news is Hyundai picked up the cost of labor and parts under warranty so I only owe $40 for the oil change.
9098 2018-10-19 19:27:35 I love the vets and so does #TedCruz . #KeepTexasRed Please, don't be swindled by this sweaty snake oil salesman.
9099 2018-10-19 19:27:31 You can't couple "marijuana use" with "cbd oil" - I can't comment on smoking, vaping, eating marijuana to get high, but CBD oil (no THC) for medical purposes is incredibly backed up by evidence. I got my mom off almost all her prescriptions with 1 drop a day.
9100 2018-10-19 19:27:25 Holyrood isn’t going to last forever Con, you know that. And something would have to be built to replace it. If the replacement is not going to be oil fired, then it’s going to cost more than a billion. You can’t call bullshit on that.
9101 2018-10-19 19:27:17 'Of course I'm a qualified medical assessor, now pop the hood so i can check your engine'
'All looks good to me, nothing an oil change and new tyres won't sort out'
'But what about the doctors advice and my terminal cancer?'
'Er... we will be in touch, bye!'

9105 2018-10-19 19:26:59 Most of the minimum wage companies were Mom and Pa small businesses like restaurants. The increase didn't drive them out of AB it drove them out of business.
Big corporations like oil companies left & set up in other countries. The 30% commercial vacancy rate in YYC reflects that
9106 2018-10-19 19:26:59 @cooheartt พี่เจอกันที่ Philippines นะ! If you want your hair to grow faster, try putting castor oil mixed with aloe vera on it. It works!! And yes, I saw in one of your interviews that you bow your head down to your waist for faster hair growth. Thats also true 
9107 2018-10-19 19:26:54 These people can operate under some type of cloak of immunity from making these outrageous claims? 
The damage done is, that in todays media any obscene, outlandish claim becomes factual to many once its seen without ANY proof whatsoever.

9117 2018-10-19 19:25:57 Tried it this morning. Cup with stevia and a cup with coconut oil. Just a little too rich (buttery) for me. I'm used to drinking Death Wish black, so I'll stick with that. I'll keep my butter on my toast and biscuits!

9121 2018-10-19 19:25:27 So far, yes. His approval is decent, state economy/budget is relatively stable, oil/gas industry is fine, and no large scandals. Kennedy may be a problem though.
9122 2018-10-19 19:25:22 Lavender essential oil and going to hot yoga helps me.  I mean if I’m not so depressed I cannot get in the damn car to go to yoga.  Hang in there.
9123 2018-10-19 19:25:20 Tea tree should come in an oil! You can also buy it in a balm to apply to pressure points. I’m not entirely sure which one actually helped.
9124 2018-10-19 19:25:19 does anybody else put hot chili oil on a PB&J or did I just create my own special flavor of genius 
9125 2018-10-19 19:25:16 It costs $425.00 a cord x 2 + HST whic will last me the whole winter. It’s a huge savings compared to oil. Huge.
9126 2018-10-19 19:25:11 Honestly, if you’re trying to look younger than you are, not drinking alcohol would be far more effective than putting snake oil on your face.
9127 2018-10-19 19:25:07 For sweetest day I just want my tank filled, oil changed and an in and out 
9128 2018-10-19 19:24:45 That oil works wonders
9129 2018-10-19 19:24:35 I sell scrubs that can control the excess oil production on your face plus and if u can get a good primer,it would help a lot
9130 2018-10-19 19:24:33 Shall I remind you who flew planes into our Twin Towers on 9/11? Bush should have incinerated the entire middle east after that. No one would miss any of you. The oil would be all ours, after the radiation went away...
9131 2018-10-19 19:24:29 What’s with these articles that give short sellers a platform to spew their disinformation? They have a clearly disclosed bias to say anything to take the company down a notch. Do you ask the oil industry if burning gas is bad for the planet? Consider the source JFC
9132 2018-10-19 19:24:28 This pic looks like an oil painting.  Precious.
9133 2018-10-19 19:24:12 Awh thank you! No problem at all  I’m super oily too  A lot of the time if you use drying products, your skin thinks it’s too dry so it produces more oil to make up for it!
9134 2018-10-19 19:24:01 An olive has to go through 3 stages for its oil to run:
-the shaking
-the beating
-and the pressing.
9135 2018-10-19 19:24:00 Hello Adam, we apologize that you received a vehicle that requires maintenance. Usually this means that the vehicle needs an oil change. If you have a long trip planned, then you will want to exchange the vehicle at the nearest Avis location, so we can get this vehicle serviced.

9137 2018-10-19 19:23:23 went to change my oil and they gave me a starbucks gift card
9138 2018-10-19 19:23:21 Not sure whether myrcene isolate will be sold as “orange oil” to get around this, but it’s my understanding that the new rule only applies to synthetics - not to essential oils or natural distillates that may contain these chemicals
9139 2018-10-19 19:23:01 @martingeddes Do you suppose that in a post-successful-Q-operation world that the Trump admin and his military would have any less interest in Israeli-controlled Golan Heights area Syrian oil fields? Or any other oil fields for that matter?
9140 2018-10-19 19:22:52 Maybe the government should put in more effort in making the punishments known , rather than licking wounds of the amount of dollars they lose as a result of oil bunkering.
9141 2018-10-19 19:22:50 Put coconut oil before you dye it or hair mask
9142 2018-10-19 19:22:49 OMG...those regulations are for the environment, protections from wall street and banks screwing with us...
This tells me you weren't checking what regulations.
We leave a dirtier planet for our kids.. oil leaks from Keystone . Please you ate what you were fed.
9143 2018-10-19 19:22:43 @Hyundai how come when I get my oil change and tires done at Jiffy Lube it’s only takes 30 mins, but when I do the same work at your dealer it takes 4 hours??
9144 2018-10-19 19:22:39 The amount of oil on my face right now is enough to fry plantain.
9145 2018-10-19 19:22:37 Maybe Mr. Konkus will tell Americans why this EPA does not think it’s appropriate to cut lead from power plants that burn coal & oil, & why EPA rolled back limits on lead from 100s of different types of industries? The prior administration rejected both rollbacks. Your response?
9146 2018-10-19 19:22:23 Only use oil vapes, herb isn’t worth the hassle and burns a lot
9147 2018-10-19 19:22:20 You should always change your own oil, every 3 months or whenever your bored I tell you hwhat.

9151 2018-10-19 19:22:01 I had a Ziggy stored in the back room unplayed for years. Dig it out, Knosti clean sounded pretty good. I weighed it as it was from the days of the oil crisis, 93g! It was like a Flexi disc

9155 2018-10-19 19:21:08 If you have a cart or two full of groceries, please don't go pay at the auto center register. It makes it harder for people to just pay for there oil/tire changes and harder to help people who just want new tires or batteries. Infact your stuff don't fit in our small counter
9156 2018-10-19 19:21:07 But a foreign oil conglomerate can use eminent domain to put a pipeline on your land. Cuz oil. Dirty oil, but $$$, right? Build windmills instead. And try walking.
9157 2018-10-19 19:21:06 No no ... they're bad people doing bad things to other people .... nothing to do with their oil ... nothing at all ... #messedupworld
9158 2018-10-19 19:20:59 SuperfoodSeries skincare from @BodhiandBirch isn’t fragrance free but it is essential oil free
9159 2018-10-19 19:20:53 As said above, Islam is to all other religions nothing but a political movement, a parallel society that can never assimilate with each other just as water and oil can never exist / assimilate with each other imho!
9160 2018-10-19 19:20:29 Coconut oil, Shea butter allat

9163 2018-10-19 19:20:23 Financial wizards and 20 of the largest banks in the world apparently ripped us eu tax paying fools of at least 55.2 bn euros.
A mirror of how big oil and short seller degenerate forces are depriving us of a future by shorting @tesla and anything fighting for future for our kids
9164 2018-10-19 19:20:20 Yes.    Season it the night before and leave it wrapped in tin foil over night with some olive oil mmmmmmm
9165 2018-10-19 19:20:14 A globally harmonized economy-wide carbon price at that level seems even less likely to happen than otherwise if we rebuff Big Oil advocacy for a carbon price.
9166 2018-10-19 19:19:58 These oil pipeline sabotaging is usually a not so clean job and oil spillage is an inevitable consequences. They then go on to complain about environmental pollution that they have in one way or the other caused for themselves.
9167 2018-10-19 19:19:57 I was just there for an oil change babe lol thanks though!
9168 2018-10-19 19:19:45 My car is so dirty right now. Inside, outside, needs oil.. 
9169 2018-10-19 19:19:40 The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black Black Oil...

9171 2018-10-19 19:19:10 try coconut oil girl !!
9172 2018-10-19 19:19:07 It’s sad that the repercussions of oil bunkering spreads wider than oil spillage itself. Apart from the fact that Nigeria loses a lot of money as a result , Nigeria loses its citizens too , due to series of explosions, recently people have linked the blast at Abia State to it!

9174 2018-10-19 19:18:56 Oil and men often go to the safe side
9175 2018-10-19 19:18:47 My skin has gone seasonal mental too, btw. It's withstanding the medium oil patches with touch ups needed on the completely mad ones.
9176 2018-10-19 19:18:47 Fracking here is water flooding. Drilling & water flooding has been going years. It doesn't cause tremors. 

And fwiw the small companies drill for oil and take all the risk the larger companies buy them up when they produce. Dividends are not payable on exploration companies. 
9177 2018-10-19 19:18:45 Going to start introducing MCT oil to my coffee. I'm so determined to stick to this diet until Christmas! Then off until the 5th if January and back on the diet again unless I'm going on any holiday's or celebrating/parties.
9178 2018-10-19 19:18:45 Already weaned ourselves off their oil. We produce our own
We DON'T NEED Saudi Arabia for anything -- even conservative @SteveSchmidtSES said that yesterday!
When a politician tells you "we" need Saudi Arabia, what he is really saying is that he makes money off Saudi Arabia.

9181 2018-10-19 19:18:19 total snake oil. Khashoggi came from one of the wealthiest families in the Kingdom. He acted as a press agent for Saudi intelligence services. MBS didn't require help from us or anyone else figuring out who he was.
9182 2018-10-19 19:18:18 my boss really has me out here looking dumb calling restaurants to order her these egg white no oil no cheese no bun no food ass looking lunches tf
9183 2018-10-19 19:18:09 Sir !!! Digging an oil field in this store is prohibited!!!

お客様っ！！！店内で油田を掘るのは禁止です！！！
9184 2018-10-19 19:17:57 Are you going to share your “other” art style on another account platform or not at all anymore? Cuz I love the oil paintings but I also love your others 
9185 2018-10-19 19:17:50 Dang, that is like the joke about the doctor who took an auto mechanic course so her husband would quit ragging on her about changing her oil.
9186 2018-10-19 19:17:43 Also why tf is her olive oil super translucent??? No way is it real olive oil
9187 2018-10-19 19:17:41 impressive. can't imagine anyone not voting for him over Cruz unless preferring deceit and smear founded on big gun/oil lobbyists.
9188 2018-10-19 19:17:32 Yes exactly Ethiopia always loots the Ogaden Gas & Oil
9189 2018-10-19 19:17:16 Talk to them about high paid jobs not only laborers. There are lot of fields in Qatar like hospital staff, oil and gas sectors, teaching and aviation. These are well paid departments and if you gets 100,000 these jobs then it will be big success towards remittances.
9190 2018-10-19 19:17:16 In the span of four days, my car will have an oil change, belt change, full set of new tires, and bumper inspection (thanks to two different distracted drivers for that last one).

My poor car. It takes such good care of me.
9191 2018-10-19 19:17:06 Oh! I hadn’t connected palm oil with plum bread - what’s in it with palm oil in it please? I’m not keen on palm oil either.
9192 2018-10-19 19:16:36 I am currently experiencing the worst period pain I’ve ever had, on top of tweaked neck muscles and what I assume is some kind of arthritis pain in my hands. Today is also the day I finally ordered CBD oil to see if it can help me with some/all of these things. Will report.

9196 2018-10-19 19:16:23  Still hunting for that olive oil app. In the meantime, we're loving our wine tasting experience across Costa Brava. Our Vivino app has made the whole experience more educational and led to some interesting discussions during our vineyard visits. 
#InCostaBrava
9197 2018-10-19 19:16:12 Like Breaking Bad but with oil instead of meth?
9198 2018-10-19 19:16:11 I opened this bottle of tea tree oil 8 hours ago and my bathroom STILL smells like tea tree oil 
9199 2018-10-19 19:16:09 Just saw a great job for @meteofrance in Toulouse to model and report on ocean drift (oil slicks, person at sea etc...). Why is the pay so low in cool jobs? :-(

I guess it's the flipside to have worked in the oil industry bubble for 20 years... #goldenhandcuffs
9200 2018-10-19 19:16:07 Scott's investments in corporations that do business with or are regulated by the state he governs, besides SunPass, involve health care, a high-speed rail system, a natural gas pipeline, prescription drugs, mosquito control and an oil services company.
9201 2018-10-19 19:15:59 link you to WAVE GROUPS all You need is a brush and oil or cream which ever you select.These groups have people out in different parts of the world waving. Every texture of hair waves different close, wide etc it's truly an art. Your not trying to get "good hair"

9204 2018-10-19 19:15:45 Rates and oil higher, dollar lower-the trifecta-and one to prepare but not root for..
9205 2018-10-19 19:15:45 try garlic infused olive oil. thats what I substitute in my cooking cause I cant be arsed peeling the garlic. seems to work well
9206 2018-10-19 19:15:29 Coco butter >>> coconut oil. Don’t @ me
9207 2018-10-19 19:15:18 Ever since the oil boom , Nigeria has faced cases of oil bunkering , initially from militants who felt they weren’t being favored as they are the custodians of crude oil generally, over the years it has spread like a malignant sore , what in my opinion is the reason? GREED.
9208 2018-10-19 19:14:59 I have also done an infused olive oil (just cut the pods in half and put them in a new bottle) and a vodka, both with habaneros. The oil was amazing for grilled cheeses, and the vodka made for killer bloody Marys.
9209 2018-10-19 19:14:51 @Amy_Claridge I am desperately seeking a palm oil free Lincolnshire plum bread, any ideas? Myers, Curtis’s, Welbourne and Modens all have palm oil 
9210 2018-10-19 19:14:46 1/ As $tsla melts down, a response to the bulls who accuse all critics of “not caring for the planet,” working for big oil, or not supporting EVs. I bought a Prius in 2006, and drove it for ten years. I replace it with a new 2016 Prius...
9211 2018-10-19 19:14:45 What if, and it's a really big idea of "if," we all realize that a person can donate their $10 dollars all they want. It's the multi million and billion dollar corporations, banks, financiers, oil, gas, guns, real estate, and private hidden off shore companies that we are after.
9212 2018-10-19 19:14:41 Ugh fleas are annoying!! Recently got rid of ours, flea treatments and lots of vacuuming! I also sprayed the house with a mixture of soapy water and lavender oil. Hope you can get rid of them fast!
9213 2018-10-19 19:14:39 In the past 2 weeks, I have learnt to appreciate and respect people’s relationship with cooking oil. No judgement, just respect #cookingoil.
9214 2018-10-19 19:14:39 So far this month i made a coconut oil + palm coconut sugar + brown sugar scrub.
Finally starting my compost bin.
Monday started a sourdough bread starter and a kombucha scoby.

Next projects are making soap & hair shampoo/conditioner.

I rather like this shift of entertainment.
9215 2018-10-19 19:14:34 Augmentation du gaz oil. Microparticules.Malus véhicules essence.Co2. Le gouvernement travaille à l écologie. Les gains générés serviront à payer les bonus pour les hybrides qui représentent moins de 5% du marché ! On nous prend vraiment pour des idiots.
9216 2018-10-19 19:14:31 Exactly 
Meeting of the minds during CS 
Harper, Wall, Kenney, Scheer & co can only mean a sharing of ideas & support

9217 2018-10-19 19:14:27 What did you do? Put oil in the car?

9219 2018-10-19 19:14:05 Been using cbd oil for about 3 days and have already noticed a huge decrease in my anxiety 
9220 2018-10-19 19:13:53 Venezuela has an economy based on oil....sounds more like Cruz will do that.
9221 2018-10-19 19:13:37 Yeah yeah I know this already. And for that reason alone, Vaseline is suffocating your skin because it’s LITERALLY “refined” trash from pumping crude oil so your skin doesn’t absorb it. That’s why it’s “protective” it doesn’t heal nor help outside of just being a “coating”
9222 2018-10-19 19:13:36 What’s a great way to spend your time while getting an oil change????? Listen to #MercuryLane by @JimmieAllen 

If you haven’t gotten this album yet you need to!
9223 2018-10-19 19:13:15 Thank you! I have all this minus the castor oil lol but ima go cop some!
9224 2018-10-19 19:13:12 They literally don’t have free markets, at all, by definition.

Further more they nationalise the shit out of any thing most people care about. Norway’s Oil/sovereign wealth fund being the ultimate example
9225 2018-10-19 19:13:11 cbd oil has also helped delay the cancer my roommate's dog has. it's definitely improved his quality of life. looking forward to hearing your experience!
9226 2018-10-19 19:13:11 Olive oil, my dude
9227 2018-10-19 19:13:06 Right??? It should be common knowledge that butter will melt when placed on top of a piping hot soup. Even if the paper didn’t melt off, we would end up with oil, not spread 
9228 2018-10-19 19:13:04 Good people of twitter, who here has experience (either good or bad) with CBD oil?
I wanna hear all about it, & your advice please. 
An RT would be much appreciated too, thanks.

GO GET an oil change! Lol
9231 2018-10-19 19:12:42 Just a guess, but I'd say that the US is desperate for a reason to remain in #Syria and this is #FakeNews.

Preventing #Assad from drilling Syrian oil to prevent stabilization under his rule is a hard sell considering the humanitarian crisis that has been created.
9232 2018-10-19 19:12:36 Renewables, legal marijuana, healthcare, education and tourism. If we focused on these industries we’d have to put guards up at the state lines to keep people from relocating here. Get rid of tired old Republican double downs on oil, gas, and cutting government spending on people
9233 2018-10-19 19:12:30 my 1st gen immigrant grandma's "specialty" was oyster crackers coated in oil and then covered in powdered onion soup mix. horrible but also delicious
9234 2018-10-19 19:12:10 @Jordan_Sather_ Do you suppose that in a post-successful-Q-operation world that the Trump admin and his military would have any less interest in Israeli-controlled Golan Heights area Syrian oil fields? Or any other oil fields for that matter?

9237 2018-10-19 19:11:40 She’s had the change oil light on since like April of this year I think not exactly sure but a VERY long time
9238 2018-10-19 19:11:38 So we believe one way or the other, you must or might have come across a headline or conversation on Oil pipeline sabotage.
But then the truth is, what do we know about Oil pipeline sabotage? 
I know right 
Drop in your tweets, let us see how well informed you are
9239 2018-10-19 19:11:25 Have the federal govt forgotten that it is because of the oil found in bayelsa they can get money to fund the govt? Oga u no get sense sha.
9240 2018-10-19 19:11:21 Have you tried cooking with grapeseed oil? I haven’t.
9241 2018-10-19 19:11:11 If Saudi Arabia stop selling oil to you you will drive a bike instead of a car YOUR FUCKING COUNTRY IS DEPENDING ON US
9242 2018-10-19 19:11:08 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
9243 2018-10-19 19:11:03 I honestly have no idea, but let’s just say I needed an oil change waaay before I even came up to Orlando :/
9244 2018-10-19 19:11:03 Sorry, but it's impossible to believe the SaskParty cares about citizens' safety given their response to the Husky oil spill.
9245 2018-10-19 19:10:59 Took a very cold shower, did my little skin routine, brushed my hair, applied my lip balm, a few drops of vanilla oil to make me smell like what I look like. 

I would totally want to fuck me
9246 2018-10-19 19:10:49 infuse an oil?

9249 2018-10-19 19:10:37 Time for an oil change. Aren’t we tired of rancid and inflammatory?
9250 2018-10-19 19:10:31 Hopefully this peppermint oil helps my tummy
9251 2018-10-19 19:10:28 You made a very unclear statement. I asked for clarification, no need to be a cunt about it. I don't need to Google anything.

We may sell the US more oil. Saudi sells a whole lot more overall. As shale boom ends US is likely to need Saudi again.

9254 2018-10-19 19:10:00 An unprecedented volume of Iranian crude oil is set to arrive at China’s northeast port of Dalian this month and in early November before US sanctions on Iran take effect. More than 20 million barrels of oil have been shipped to Dalian by the National Iranian Tanker Company.
9255 2018-10-19 19:09:55 Saudi is less than 1 m per day. Not 8 times I was wrong,  but about 4-5 times larger. The point is that the US is not dependent all on Saudis for oil
9256 2018-10-19 19:09:39 until we boycott gasoline and have 100 RE every oil fiend against the war and climate change is a hypocrite and cannot defeat the evil forces that have this argument in their bag
9257 2018-10-19 19:09:39 I suppose if they cut off our supply and supply lines for oil they probably would. Also, not disagreeing with your tweet. Just stating that we've been deep in Saudi's shit for a very, very long time.

9260 2018-10-19 19:09:06 I keep vegetable oil but I only use it to grease my cast iron.
9261 2018-10-19 19:09:06 Every single person that voices their opinion about politics is swaying the public... but we only care if they're Russian. Could it be that this is more about competing with them for the market of weapons and military equipment, and also competing in the oil industry
9262 2018-10-19 19:09:04 Oil companies home offices here

9269 2018-10-19 19:08:14 U ryt... they used engine oil
9270 2018-10-19 19:08:12 But can it change your oil or paint your house?
9271 2018-10-19 19:07:57 I don't use moisturizers anymore but instead use coconut oil
9272 2018-10-19 19:07:52 There will be new high momentum stocks be sure. Combustion and oil is dead and there is a replacement for it. Watch it unfold. Hydrogen economy.
9273 2018-10-19 19:07:47 It is. Almost 10 times costlier than the refined oil.
9274 2018-10-19 19:07:42 
9275 2018-10-19 19:07:37 Who supplied all the new looking backpacks?
9276 2018-10-19 19:07:29 In fairness what would you have them do? No-one is going to war with Saudi Arabia. We could cut diplomatic ties, stop buying their oil & selling them weapons but that's about it sadly.
9277 2018-10-19 19:07:11 Accidental discovery of the day: Pumpkin seed oil not only looks like soy sauce, it also tastes great in Asian stir fry.

9282 2018-10-19 19:06:51 Nigeria, an oil producing nation is where it is today because of the corrupt breeds of ABU #futmxVsAbu
9283 2018-10-19 19:06:48 About 60.2 million barrels of crude oil were stolen from Nigeria between 2011-2014. Value of the stolen oil amounted to $12.7 billion USD. 

That was oil discharged in just one port-Philadelphian port,USA. 

"Oil majors & shipping companies involved were identified"-Falana SAN)
9284 2018-10-19 19:06:47 He was a Washington Post journalist. He was tortured and his fingers hacked off. We are invlovled because we need oil. We had a war because of oil. The Middle East did not welcome us with open arms. Did you forget the Bush family and oil lobbies. 9/11 was Saudis. Replace oil.
9285 2018-10-19 19:06:47 Let alone the loss of billions in the energy sector, and the future loss of the oil sands and no pipelines to tide  water.

9288 2018-10-19 19:06:24 @osmo_uk we have Siberian larch cladding looking at treating it What product do you recommend as we looked on your website and seen that the tinted oil for larch would be the best as had 3 star uv rating but the dulex shop we went to recommended the clear that had 1 star

9299 2018-10-19 19:05:52 Lol!! All the oils have their specific usage amongst different recipes. Cooking a baingan-chokha in refined oil is madness 
9300 2018-10-19 19:05:47 @realDonaldTrump I want to give advice to the Treasury about the oil boycott; in the previous government, the Iranian regime fired off the boycott with silent ships, but they could track them using GPS. You can block them by using GPS
9301 2018-10-19 19:05:44 I'm so tired and oil.

9303 2018-10-19 19:05:39 Yes but a Guard is seen as more of a protective tool rather than an aggressive use of oil and spray up to mess with other people.
9304 2018-10-19 19:05:38 Who takes CBD oil? What do you take it for?
9305 2018-10-19 19:05:37 I didnt even get to change my oil yet
9306 2018-10-19 19:05:26 aye that beard oil really do bless.
9307 2018-10-19 19:05:25 I’m more sympathetic to that, although the idea that governments should either regulate or price emissions (not both) comes from environmental economics, not Big Oil.
9308 2018-10-19 19:05:20 Oil heck I fixed that spelling error what the hell phone

9310 2018-10-19 19:04:59 it was v good and v easy! the salmon was done in my favourite fish spice mix, and the veggies were sautéed with cholula sauce, salt & pepper, and shallot/garlic oil (but you can use whatever oil you want, I just couldn’t be bothered to chop some garlic up)
9311 2018-10-19 19:04:55 Sorry, were you writing to me?
If so, i know he’s not a us citizen but it seemed like a petty point. And yes, oil has made for some strange bedfellows. I truly wish we didn’t need it. I realize that’s naive but it’s a dream. The Saudis royals are guilty of a lot

9318 2018-10-19 19:03:26 Good news for us is we can produce our own oil.
9319 2018-10-19 19:03:17 Instead of the oil derrick? Why?!!!!
9320 2018-10-19 19:03:14 Filled my juul with CBD oil. Life changing!

9322 2018-10-19 19:02:50 Yes but Big Oil, and Tree Huggers latch on to 3 mile and Chernobyl as the inevitable conclusion of every Nuclear Power plant, without even attempting to mention the hundreds of others that are working perfectly fine.

9331 2018-10-19 19:01:15 Let me tell you this, nationalized oil is a far cry from "nationalizing your house," as this lady suggests. The oil companies in the USA take their profits and corrupt the government.

Radically transparent & accountable government is necessary, regardless of ideology.

9333 2018-10-19 19:01:11 Google imports of oil and oil products to the US from canada and saudi Arabia. I'd do it for you but I'm not at a computer. Canada is the largest by far at close 4M per day,  total is 7-8. And imports are shrinking steadily as more shale is found.
9334 2018-10-19 19:01:05 Needs effort to build better structures. And the culture of $1  thing costing $100 to average  person has to be fixed. Greed is good but though we tried fixing that with "Standards Oil".
9335 2018-10-19 19:01:05 This line to get my oil changed is too damn long. I ain’t fucking with it
9336 2018-10-19 19:01:04 I think most people have problem with Tabacco companies. They  claimed under oath to a Senate committee that smoking is not harmful to health and that they didn't doctor the product to maintain addiction. This industry make Big Oil look positively benign.
9337 2018-10-19 19:01:01 Yes peppercorns but I cover it & with a drizzle of olive oil wrap it in tin foil and let it season over night

The fossil fuels industry might be booming NOW, but when humans start to die off from a superpolluted atmosphere, people will look back at how ignorant you were.

9358 2018-10-19 18:58:53 This is a case of the U.S.A to be energy independent in regards to oil production. Trump is in a damn if he does and damn if he don't. Upset or piss the Saudi's off they constrict oil production and what does that do to the American consumer.

9365 2018-10-19 18:57:44 There are problems with Venezuela, but everywhere there is private capital, private oil companies, & right wing governments, there is even more suffering. There's just glittery rich people to cover up the poverty.

9368 2018-10-19 18:57:28 Saudi Arabia has been getting away with murder for decades. Only because of their oil. 15 of the 19 9/11 terrorist are Saudis. Bin Laden was a Saudi. They fund terror worldwide. Now they've murdered a journalist and dismembered him. I think it's time the world made them pay.

9378 2018-10-19 18:55:46 You will have to ask him. I think Clean Energy would create a lot of jobs. Solar energy, wind energy, hydroelectric energy, Geothermal energy. Then the U.S could use it's own oil for our Country only & not rely on foreign Countries. Creating those Clean energy would make jobs.

9398 2018-10-19 18:53:14 Transportation is 50% of all demand for oil. That will take a couple of decades at least. But I'm with you,  they should mandate all electric vehicles immediately but they won't, at least not until the big manufacturers have a decent offering.

9406 2018-10-19 18:52:16 I don't believe KSA is "expendable" to the west. They are an integral part of a scheme to launder money from consumers of oil all over the world, through the military industrial complex (and a system of pay-to-play influence peddling bribery), into accounts of the rich/powerful.

Ladies please take frequent showers, exfoliate and invest in some coconut oil, Shea butter or cocoa butter (the pure raw stuff) so your men can stay away from someone us’s arms okay

9427 2018-10-19 18:49:51 i think many would agree tearing down rainforest to plant palm oil trees or sugar cane is totally being mispriced by the markets. Then, my take on that is that goverments must take all blame for not taxing where needed. hope we can get a lot better at that ...

9.5 million in Honduras alone.
Under current laws there is no way to end it, the system is simply unable to process a thousand people or more per day.

Who’s banking system were Syria using? 
Why was Syria named in the countries targeted in the project for a new American century? 
Why was Syria reported on re Gen Wesley Clarke?
9436 2018-10-19 18:48:50 Preparing this food was a bad idea. Burnt my hands, this cooking oil be jumping JUMPING.
9437 2018-10-19 18:48:49 I drive a Camry and still spend over 50 in a oil change 
9438 2018-10-19 18:48:28 What? I question in a big way any relief for life on the planet from the D Party. Both D and R are war-for-oil empire parties and demand our domination by Wall Street. War, their military are the biggest curse. Ask the Libyan and Honduran people about HRC/Obama.
9439 2018-10-19 18:48:25 Yes Sir. Those were the days when we were so innocent  and things were so peaceful and enjoyable. Before we even had any ideas of going hoarding cooking oil from the supermarkets.
9440 2018-10-19 18:47:58 ...And let’s face it all the Brexit elite bunch are able to stash cash while selling Snake Oil to the people who can’t. Grief when will these people wake up !
9441 2018-10-19 18:47:51 @nassnigeria Can you please ask @AsoRock why our foreign reserve is dropping at a time when oil prices are higher than ever?

9442 2018-10-19 18:47:50 Good tip, thanks! Might pick some up tomorrow. Or possibly some kind of cleansing oil...
9443 2018-10-19 18:47:26 Witnessed this clown licking the arses of oil execs in Aberdeen a few weeks ago. Cringeworthy stuff.
9444 2018-10-19 18:47:23 Not to mention due to @realDonaldTrump China purchased ZERO OIL from Texas this month. Texas economy will suffer!
9445 2018-10-19 18:47:17 We are having a very bad experience with our 2015 Lincoln MKC that we purchased from Lithia Lincoln in Boise, Idaho.  Nice guys do finish last.  7 times to fix an oil leak.  Numerous other issues.  Poor service.  Dishonest dealership!
9446 2018-10-19 18:47:15 yallllll... i cannot even begin to explain how happy i am that i started taking CBD oil. i was terrified because i don’t smoke weed and absolutely can’t (for mental health reasons) but CBD has been INCREDIBLE. Lowering my blood pressure, heart rate, AND ANXIETY. Miracle!!!!!

9451 2018-10-19 18:46:29 Hi @OfficeSmallBiz We use raw milk from our own happy goats, which makes the soaps super creamy and moisturising. The raw milk is also packed full of vitamins and minerals, making the soaps excellent ‘skin food’! Only 100% natural ingredients go into our soaps. No palm oil! 
9452 2018-10-19 18:46:15 Yes, yes you are Eric Trump. Saudia Arabia are not our friends. They kill, maim and torture dissenters. We don't need them for oil. Punish M.B.S. now!
9453 2018-10-19 18:46:14 It has always rained.  Loo paper & kitchen roll used to come wrapped in paper.  No one complained. Humans are actually q. resourceful.
Just because you don't remember the days b4 the oil & plastic lobby pushed for more plastic packaging you don't have to display your ignorance.
9454 2018-10-19 18:46:06 Left home late but caught no traffic, ordered the wrong bagel bites at Starbucks but somehow got the ones I actually wanted AND landed an interview for a paid internship... I don’t even care about the oil stain I just got on my top!!! HAPPY ALOHA FRIDAY YALL

•Waiting for a 75c kombi when they are charging $1
•standing in gas queues

9461 2018-10-19 18:45:17 None of the GCF contributors (except maybe one!) can afford headlines back home that they used GCF money to subsidize oil and gas operations.  My guess is this project is toast.
9462 2018-10-19 18:45:17 socialism didn't cause Venezuelas issues predatory capitalism did. People need to dig down to the facts. 2015 the ban on oil being exported from the US was lifted causing a flood of oil to the market why is the US the largest Exporter and Importer of oil??
9463 2018-10-19 18:45:13 Oil spill zeb
9464 2018-10-19 18:45:11 Throughout d reign of that profligate party, they claimed 6% growth of GDP, but nobody felt it. Rather than fix our refineries in 16 yrs, they sold crude oil, imported petrol, rather than invest in agric, they became suppliers of rice from Thailand. Everything was squandered.
9465 2018-10-19 18:45:07 Let us import only the raw materials i am sure we have the capacity to make good shoes,furniture,wears etc..... Importing Pms is the craziest thing an oil exporting country should be involved in, the people that create this scenario should be hanged in public

9467 2018-10-19 18:44:52 Oil producing countries thought that because they had the oil & the money they could get away with everything. And they did and still do. Saudi Arabia & Venezuela are clear cases. A test for the internacional community.
9468 2018-10-19 18:44:50 It is definitely my day off... I've been up since 7 am, gone to the gym, the store, and changed the oil in my car. Now I get to shower, finally, then start making dinner because it's going to take awhile.

Adulting means doing more on the weekend than you do on workdays... right?
9469 2018-10-19 18:44:46 Yes things have changed my nieces, nephews and cousins always remind me that I used to bring them gifts from Zim and after changing a few Zim dollars one was very rich in Kwacha. Tell them to bring salad aka cooking oil in Zim.

 will (at that point) become 2nd $ product for LP’s, and the real top shelf craft @brokencoastltd and @TantalusLabs will finally see appreciation from the masses.

Thoughts?
9473 2018-10-19 18:44:06 I'm guessing it's either engine grease or gun oil.

9478 2018-10-19 18:43:15 @HouseDemocrats Stop promoting fossil fuels to destroy the earth. Stop allowing purchases by corporations of gas/oil/plastic products as business expenses. Individuals don't get tax write-offs so corporations should not.
9479 2018-10-19 18:43:12 All that still ain’t as bad as socialist snake oil salesman fake ass latino Beto when Cruz is more latino but doesn’t go around claiming it for votes and supports way more of our president’s policy. Only a nitwit couldn’t see why Trump chooses Ted over Robert.

9483 2018-10-19 18:42:49 As someone who takes that to help with my insomnia and also puts hotsauce on everything Im down . Gonna need to do something to balance out the earthy flavor of the oil though
9484 2018-10-19 18:42:45 Wow.. oil is sold in $$ ... we have our food and from around the world including Newzeland and Hawaii and flowers from singapore by airplanes .. troll ..
9485 2018-10-19 18:42:35 And of course throwing money at oil and coal will help the development of the technology. That’s why you’re backwards thinking. E for science knowledge. Beto all the way
9486 2018-10-19 18:42:29 I make a mean pear garganzola with candided walnuts.  Throw some arugula on that, a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar and pair it with a Dr Pepper.
9487 2018-10-19 18:42:28 I love my car; for 100+ years since discovering oil, humans have expanded beyond the capability of the planet to sustain the current population at this level of activity for another 100 + years. We do this or accept that our great grandchildren will live in a different place!
9488 2018-10-19 18:42:28 PDP ruled for 16 yrs. Crude oil was selling for over $100 per barrel for a significant part of this period. Rather than invest in the ppl, they looted and became profligate. The govt became a poverty generator, poor Nigerians increased from about 36m in 2004 to about 112m by 2012

9497 2018-10-19 18:41:41 I assume there is more money for work about "energy transition" and "sustainable futures" than there is for work in history of oil. Lol.
9498 2018-10-19 18:41:36 it is good for everyone that the Iranians sell their oil benefits to both countries.
9499 2018-10-19 18:41:35 But they do want our country's resources. They lust over our land, water, gas, oil & mineral resources! @POTUS, your "cleaning house" is ramping their drive to seize control of our resources. In collusion with elected officials, they're panicking & harming our resource providers.
9500 2018-10-19 18:41:26 I hate paying for an oil change when I know I can do it myself. Laziness is of the devil.
9501 2018-10-19 18:41:25 price oil $25/barrel 2016. Now $~70/barrel. zero inflation. all orchestrated. i think inflation is real and sometimes not. in 07, 150/bl. not sure impact from arab 73 crisis but sure not all change from 1968 can be blamed on "inflation". make sense? disagreements can be cool :-)
9502 2018-10-19 18:41:22 Not clear. Oil IS liquid at room temp. Butter not.
9503 2018-10-19 18:41:22 The US Government works for the oil companies.
9504 2018-10-19 18:41:21 how is it that junior @JustinTrudeau and @NavdeepSBains give $50MM to an Indian steel company now in Luxembourg.  Steel industry is important, but contributes only 0.25% to Canada's GDP.  Oil industry contributes 11.00%!  Where are the handouts to the Western province industries?

9518 2018-10-19 18:39:15 Took the car to get washed, got an oil change all while I was getting my nails, toes and lashes done. I love my Dad so much.
9519 2018-10-19 18:39:14 The question would have been why did we save when oil was sold above 100 dollar per barrel and we export over 2.1 billion barrels per day

9522 2018-10-19 18:39:07 All those accusing him loudest were part of d PDP.The party that earned over $800 billion from crude oil in 16 years and didn’t deliver anything. No power, no roads,no raileducation wasted,health facilities wasted, agriculture zero, fuel imported for 16 yrs. yet we hv crude oil.

9524 2018-10-19 18:38:57 Exactly. Fossil fuel taxes are a moral hazard. Oil profit funding for academic programs and political campaigns are also moral hazards.
9525 2018-10-19 18:38:42 Take your money and oil and shove it. 
9526 2018-10-19 18:38:42 there might be some info to sleuth out at oklahoma norman, which definitely talked up its oil money and environ hum stuff last year
9527 2018-10-19 18:38:39 Now would oil producers just cut some american operations to balance it out? Probably... but laying people off is never a popular idea, and would most definitely create a huge backlash if fuel costs increased as a byproduct.

9552 2018-10-19 18:35:40 The war in cannabis was created by industrialists who felt it would threaten their monopoly over certain markets. Cannabis is an incredibly useful plant, you can make paper, fabric, oil from it for instance, and then there are the medical benefits

9554 2018-10-19 18:35:34 But the climate change happens slowly over many thousands of years....not quickly over 150..... I'm starting to think there's no reasoning with you, you blindly believe the one scientist who's paid by Big Oil who says climate change is a hoax. Instead of the thousands who

9558 2018-10-19 18:35:14 The #USA should reduce the oïl it buys from #SaudiArabia and for God's sake stop selling them weapons.
9559 2018-10-19 18:35:09 The republicans are enamored with fossil fuel.  All these wars we’re involved with in the Middle East mostly rooted in addiction to middle east fossil fuel.  Even though we now get most of our oil from Canada.
9560 2018-10-19 18:35:04 @PlasticPollutes Banning plastics is one way to fight the problem. On another front governments can stop promoting the use of plastic and other oil products through allowing their purchase as tax deductible business expenses. Stop government tax subsidy for polluters.

9563 2018-10-19 18:34:30 No problem with that. Ban fossil fuels, put oil companies out of business. Tax fossil fuels or nationalize the oil companies, and u are in the fossil fuel business. #keepitintheground #banfossilfuels
9564 2018-10-19 18:34:21 Azerbaijan's top exports in 2016 were crude oil (76%, $9.4 billion), natural gas (9%, $1.1 billion), refined petroleum (3%, $420 million), and fruits/vegetables (3%, $376 million) 
9565 2018-10-19 18:34:21 Big deal has been big oil getting involved, they want people charging at stations so they can sell them stuff. I think Shell have bought ChargeMaster.

9571 2018-10-19 18:33:47 Trump is thinking more of installing his own dictator ala Saddam Hussein to guarantee US oil like the US has done for decades/ centuries. I'm sure the US funded oposition Venezuela from day 1- just like in Honduras, where we see refugees flooding out

9583 2018-10-19 18:32:38 This is real oil robbery of Congress govt one oil PSU company paid dividends of  3360 cr in 5 years. From 2015-2018, same oil PSU gave 60000 cr to Govt as dividends. Nearly 18 times.

9585 2018-10-19 18:31:44 Nope oil profit will not be used to pay for the social system. That money stays in private pockets in tax haven only.

9590 2018-10-19 18:31:32 is that the one that lets oil and gas companies have sex with your wife and drink all the beer in your fridge?
9591 2018-10-19 18:31:30 The climate crisis is different. Prior injustice was caused by government. This crisis is caused by corporations. The sons of the founding mothers guarded against government. It is our job to guard against corporations, by democratically putting an oil company out of business.
9592 2018-10-19 18:31:18 anyone who has a problem with medical marijuana can now officially fight me because cbd oil gets rid of my migraine headaches and constant seizures - something prescription pharmaceuticals have been failing to do for over 6 months now
9593 2018-10-19 18:31:08 if I can change my cloths then why can’t my oil change itself
9594 2018-10-19 18:31:05 Harsh reality is we still need their oil, our universities and private language schools need them as students.

9607 2018-10-19 18:29:39 So the crude oil is the major price determinants than coal. That what it means I suppose.
9608 2018-10-19 18:29:39 What nationalise oil of Texas for the benefit of the poors??!! Nope won’t happened in USA under republicans or democrats.
9609 2018-10-19 18:29:38 We are not ready, our morale is low we lost a comrade yesterday.
9610 2018-10-19 18:29:26 They should call an oil strain "Trudeau's Tears".  It would be a best seller.#cdnpoli
9611 2018-10-19 18:29:23 Look how deep they have to drill for oil into the ocean floor.
9612 2018-10-19 18:29:14 Great fats /protein (EVOO, fish oil, great chocolate, etc.), great wine, smaller meals, and exercise more.  

Nationalized health care is not a factor.
9613 2018-10-19 18:28:52 Here I thought that, with just getting an oil change, that I’d be in and out inside of an hour. It’s been an hour and no end in sight 
9614 2018-10-19 18:28:42 The ''regime'' is what it is, and being so for hundreds of years: we chose their oil (even after 1973) over our phony principles and values.
9615 2018-10-19 18:28:31 Because paper isn’t waterproof, and you don’t want your paper to be porridge like wet. So you’d use paraffin-covered paper to be waterproof, but paraffin is oil...
9616 2018-10-19 18:28:30 Well, my question is this. Is he using an oil rig to smoke herb? There is no shotgunning here, and that "bowl" looks like some sort of dab rig bowl.
9617 2018-10-19 18:28:12 Seeing the "American Petroleum Association" (genocide supporters) give out pamphlets against @yeson1631 is rich.

The oil industry is notorious for using biased, oil insider "scientists" to skew what 98%+ of scientists have proven to be true:

Fossil fuels = Climate Catastrophe

9619 2018-10-19 18:28:11 P.s Well I'll send it tomorrow on your dm because you're my baby oil 
9620 2018-10-19 18:28:04 Hmm I don’t think I would be the oil, I got it changed not too long ago & it’s not due for another change yet until the end of november
9621 2018-10-19 18:27:58 I sincerely hope not.  If that’s truly how you think, you’re likely to fall for any snake oil salesmen so long as he’s nice to you.
9622 2018-10-19 18:27:57 fight fire with fire, so I guess you have to use some oil to get off of it.
9623 2018-10-19 18:27:50 @jsnover the MCT oil really works! I was super tired and hungover today and had a bulletproof coffee felt much better immediately.
9624 2018-10-19 18:27:50 Do u oil price have bn more 60dollars a barrel for more than a year yet they keep borrowing 
Budget is premised on 50dollars in which 2017 budget hasn't bn fully executed so what happened to 2018 budget n funds?
9625 2018-10-19 18:27:40 US Oil Rig Count ↑4 rigs from last wk to 873 & ↑137 y/y. Cda Oil Rig Count ↓4 rigs from last wk to 123 & ↑16y/y. $USO $XLE $XOP $OIH $CL_F

9627 2018-10-19 18:27:33 Why... If the government find diamond or oil in your backyard, its government property. But if they find drugs it's yours
9628 2018-10-19 18:27:33 It uses coal for Secunda. Natref (a joint venture with Total) uses crude oil that is transported from the coast. Hope that helps

9638 2018-10-19 18:26:08 This one is so dumb, especially because I am pretty sure it is ALREADY illegal to drill for oil and natural gas in those places
9639 2018-10-19 18:26:06 The Oil is good for anxiety.  Helps relax.

9643 2018-10-19 18:25:42 Yup that's what happens when you trade oil in Chinese Yuan instead of their precious petrol dollar. Going to enjoy watching the US and Saudi collapse.
9644 2018-10-19 18:25:38 For years after the tobacco ban Yamaha have struggled to get sponsors.  FIAT for a few years, then nothing really compared to HRC and even Ducati.  Just Yamaha's own chain oil ().  Maybe Monster need Yamaha to balance the presence of Red Bull!?

9647 2018-10-19 18:25:31 >olive oil

Mediterranean cuisine was a mistake.
9648 2018-10-19 18:25:28 The Right loves to earmark Venezuela as an example of why socialism is a failed system while ignoring the fact that the main reason the country is in such bad shape is because the Vnzla gov't was heavily invested into oil and their economy tanked when the price of oil did.
9649 2018-10-19 18:25:06 Not likely. There is this huge thing out in space called the Sun. Solar energy is the future. Oil and its byproducts are bad for the the planet, except under the ground where it belongs. Is it too much to ask for you all to give up silly religion and join the 21st Century?

9687 2018-10-19 18:19:43 Is she drinking coffee or oil?
9688 2018-10-19 18:19:43 Especially when it's for oil.
9689 2018-10-19 18:19:41 Lmfao!!! I’m always the one covered in grease and oil because they claim I’m the prospect cuz those assholes been here a month longer than me haha
9690 2018-10-19 18:19:36 I'm so soft for my baby oil 
9691 2018-10-19 18:19:29 Wikileaks indicted him on oil bunkering. It's an open secret,  you can't defend this Adamawa looter,  never shall we go back to them. He really stole from us.
9692 2018-10-19 18:19:26 I have to go. Have been trying ‘block scheduling’ & part of it is during certain blocks of time no phone use

But I want us away from Saudi Arabia (not its people) its govt and our sick dependency on their oil

We excuse &enable atrocities, aid in wars just to hold onto oil

Bye!
9693 2018-10-19 18:19:16 I'm sorry, the oil change software is not compatible with the feminine urges already installed. Please stay tuned for the sexbot update scheduled for next month and we will try to address this issue

9695 2018-10-19 18:18:57 Chef Gusteau cut up some live rats, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a fine cut of beef, along with hot sauce.

9697 2018-10-19 18:18:54 وعدد ٨ 
 (8) Thou lovest tzedek, and hatest resha; therefore Elohim, Eloheicha, hath anointed Thee with shemen sasson (the oil of gladness) above Thy chaverim.

في العددين يستخدم Elohim. الترجمة التي ارسلتها لي هي ترجمة ضد ألوهية السيد المسيح، مثل ماهي ترجمة شهود يهوه.
9698 2018-10-19 18:18:49 Looks like pot is of more interest then our oil and gas industry that is about a 100 billion and very easily be built to a 150 billion.
9699 2018-10-19 18:18:40 Right. It’s the new coconut oil.
9700 2018-10-19 18:18:34 We are the largest country producing the purest crude oil in the world. When we prevent you from oil, the American economy will not hold for more than two weeks. Then you will cook on firewood and light candles forever.
9701 2018-10-19 18:18:29 Saudi Arabians are not bad people. They are oil businessmen. They’re like me, except the Muslim version
9702 2018-10-19 18:18:26 Obama is the one who bowed down to the Saudi prince! Short term memory loss is so convenient, isn't it? Our oil fields are booming because now they are required to accept our oil and also pay tariffs for their products sold here! Economy 101!
9703 2018-10-19 18:18:21 The US,would'nt take much action on a country that can spike the price of crude oil to $300 a barrel,or a nation that is one of the largest buyer of it arms or one of it strategic Patner in the middle East.
9704 2018-10-19 18:18:16 How? They will change MbS and things will rumble on as is until the world is weaned off oil or it runs out. Maybe China will be Saudis new best friend in next 10 years however.
9705 2018-10-19 18:18:11 No, that is coconut oil

9715 2018-10-19 18:17:14 The Ooni of Ife is a polytheist - a worshipper of multiple gods - overseer of 401 traditional deities in Ile Ife - and a follower of Christ - now married to a Christian prophetess. Is this an oil & water relationship and is a powerful Yoruba seat under threat?

9717 2018-10-19 18:16:52 US Sanctions were dropped on Corrupt Venezuelan Stakeholders. People who gathered a Freaking fortune of oil/drugs money laundry.

Lefty optimists should go to legit sources prior to put their feet in their mouth.
9718 2018-10-19 18:16:44 Not really. For sure they want to defend their business but I think you will find the majors are also the biggest investors in solar and wind. Just remember not all oil products are used for transport. A lot is used to grow vegetables. With out it 50% or more of the world starves
9719 2018-10-19 18:16:42 I just did a oil change on my Lincoln and it was only $50 lmao

Petroleum will be a new area, Haldia revived by Modi, & now oil exploration promised by cos like in Godavari basin. Not best for environment though.
9728 2018-10-19 18:16:00 @dandakich Lucas Oil wasn't even 70% full when Pittsburgh tookover Indy Last year. The crowd will be dreadful Sunday.
9729 2018-10-19 18:15:46 Yes. There are techniques to use linseed oil as a "drip" thinner over an underpainting of the usual oil paints. Mostly abstract, as I recall. Wood makes sense as a surface for it.

I'm not much on oil paints. I work too fast. Acrylic on canvas works better for me.

Nigeria depends solely on oil in the global market. After The country experienced an oil boom between 2011_2014 with oil selling at an average of $110/barrel.

9739 2018-10-19 18:15:05 The CO2 emissions reductions would be substantial.  Based on an average car getting 24 mpg, the KC-STL hyperloop would save up to 9,254 metric tons of C02 per day.  That's equivalent to 21,424 barrels of oil.  Every day.

9744 2018-10-19 18:14:33 Let's review:
   -Osama bin Laden was Saudi
   -15 of 19 9/11 hijackers were Saudi
   -Saudis use US made cluster bombs to kill Yemenis targeting school bus
   -Saudis organized OPEC oil embargo against US in '70's
9745 2018-10-19 18:14:22 Piss on Saudi Arabia, after 911 we should not have anything to do with them! We do not need their Oil or anything else that they may have!
9746 2018-10-19 18:14:09 Your #MCM still follows Gary Vee and participates in his snake oil salesman 'hustle' competitions on instagram
9747 2018-10-19 18:14:05 @EncryptionGirl Regardless of sex, you are a great snake oil marketer. Too bad, because with a little more education, you might realize this and promote legitimate projects instead.
9748 2018-10-19 18:14:02 What is the cost of dumping oilfield waste water into rivers and lakes? 10 dollars a barrel is less than 3 cents a gallon. He wants to use that money on roades, bridges, dams, rebuilding. Plus if you have ever lived in Texas  you would know oil is a boom and bust business.
9749 2018-10-19 18:13:58 Hemp oil doesn't kill pain. The THC in whole plant oil does. 99% of the 'cbd' oil sold is hemp oil & contains no thc.

9752 2018-10-19 18:13:34 15 of the 19 9-11 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia. Stop taking their oil and their money and singing kumbaya around their orbs until we figure out what the hell is going on.

9758 2018-10-19 18:12:59 Beeswax is stickier substance so shouldn't run as much as linseed oil. I think problem with linseed oil (even if boiled) is that need something to soak it up like wood, (& a very dehydrated wood,) that will sponge it up. ...Always good to experiment and try out though!

Why would we build a pipeline when no one wants the dirty oil now?
9773 2018-10-19 18:11:15 Unlike coconut oil which may have clear benefits, cannabis legalization seems very ill advised...unless we want MORE impaired driving, vehicular homicide, workplace accidents and, most likely, adverse health consequences. One of the dumbest laws ever passed in Canada, IMO.

9794 2018-10-19 18:09:39 in the case of oil in the Permanian we need new pipelines, but as it is they converting gas pipelines to oil ...so not so much of matter of moving gas...we can, thus becoming a huge exporter ...hope that answers your question
9795 2018-10-19 18:09:37 We could have a HEALTHY economy and citizenry based on getting our country off our ADDICTION to oil.

9801 2018-10-19 18:08:32 Because other Arab countries defied America. KSA since 1972 has gone into an exclusive contract to sell oil to America giving birth to the concept of Petro-Dollar. 

They even have the biggest refinery called ARAB-AMERICAN OIL company. ARAMCO.

9806 2018-10-19 18:07:52 They want sanctions.. To stop the flow of oil and send gas prices to 10 bucks a gallon just before midterms. They can't figure out how to stop the Trump economy train and they have no solutions. They are trying to protect that fringe radical party called the Dimms!!!

9821 2018-10-19 18:06:02 2 hours for this “30 minute oil change” 
9822 2018-10-19 18:05:59 OKAY HERES AN IDEA WHEN SOMEONE MAKES AN APPOINTMENT TO GET THEIR OIL CHANGED AT 11 MAKE SURE THAT TIME FRAME IS OPEN I GOT HERE AT 10:45 15 MINUTES EARLY IM NEVER EARLY FOR ANYTHING AND THEY DIDNT GET ME IN UNTIL 12:30 AND THEY TOOK PEOPLE WHO DIDNT HAVE AN APPOINTMENT BEFORE ME
9823 2018-10-19 18:05:53 There could be a lot of effects of Khashaggi's murder
Can't understand why turkey would release the tape when admitting embassies are bugged could destroy the UN, only russia wants that
This is why USA should have signed Paris accord,  we need carbon tax and to move away from oil
9824 2018-10-19 18:05:50 Gukurahundi blamed dissidents
Economy we blamed sanctions
Cholera we blame MDC

No blame for @edmnangagwa @zanupf_patriots 
9825 2018-10-19 18:05:47 How many of these bogus snake oil peddlers are out there?  Block one or two a week...guess there’s enough suckers out there that believe this  to make it pay off! Pathetic..Not gonna block this time - just click on to cost em ad $$$.
9826 2018-10-19 18:05:46 Who ‘owns’ the oil ?
Who ‘owns’ the salmon ? 
Who ‘owns’ the oil ? 

I mean, WHERE do the profits go ?
9827 2018-10-19 18:05:32 Yeah I’ve read the cases. (Side note: my grandfather read The Times his whole life because that’s what gentlemen did). American brain surgeons and Oxford academics have been booted with Egyptian car mechanics and Nigerian oil workers. /1
9828 2018-10-19 18:05:25 Replacing sauce with motor oil doesn’t sound great but to each their own
9829 2018-10-19 18:04:54 Screw that, just stop that shit now, we do not get locally accessed oil. It gets shipped overseas (or stored offshore until it can be bartered to create or dissipate an imagined oil crisis created by vendors and stockholders.) Anyone working in the industry knows that already.
9830 2018-10-19 18:04:38 I needed an oil change cuzzo
9831 2018-10-19 18:04:32 Like oil and water they will viciously repel each other and shoot away in opposite directions.
9832 2018-10-19 18:04:31 I've done a version of it with linseed oil. Takes a lifetime to dry... so not my favorite. I'm assuming the beeswax is completely different in that department. Very cool!
9833 2018-10-19 18:04:17 Agree, commodities especially oil implies growth in future. Higher Oil price 140$ was accept in 07/08 due to growth in world nd fall to 45$ in yr show higher debt nd collapse of financial. Past history is best teacher if anyone is willing to learn with broaden tght process
9834 2018-10-19 18:04:11 Yeah for real. Get the cops to stop looking up innocent people and putting them into the new slavery system. Get billionaires to stop hoarding wealth that would save lives. Get private oil and coal corporations to stop polluting the earth. They're at war with us. People r dying.
9835 2018-10-19 18:04:02 We are not the first country to expropriate property. Libya, Venezuela, Iran and others nationalised their oil industries. The land issue cannot be undone. The best we can do is pay compensation and move on but promise never to do it again. It's a costly exercise.
9836 2018-10-19 18:03:56 Apparently you haven't been keeping up with your oil sands technology or the studies that show carbon-intensity will drop about 20% over next 10 years, and that's without including CCIR, methane emissions regs, or transformative tech like IPEP, solvent substitution.

9840 2018-10-19 18:03:43 It's to do with the saturated fat in the coconut oil.
9841 2018-10-19 18:03:22 I’m afraid they’re far too invested in maintaining status quo within ranks, but they really need to hear and absorb what you and others are saying.

9846 2018-10-19 18:02:45 we've run out of oil so the house is freezing and it's inconvenient being naked all the time so I've started trying to incorporate jumpers into my porn
9847 2018-10-19 18:02:40 I had a couple of friends stop by yesterday so I had them try the oil. One yelled "you're going to kill somebody".  Other guy said" It's the hottest stuff I have ever tried"
9848 2018-10-19 18:02:23 A fraud in what since?  He ran as a centrist.
When did he ever promise to eliminate gas and oil energy?
He negotiated the tax cuts for middle and lower income families to keep, while discontinuing some of them for the rich.  "Creating 20 trillion dollars" is obvious nonsense. 1/

9851 2018-10-19 18:02:09 "Why did it last that long?"

Because of crude oil.
9852 2018-10-19 18:01:56 My skin is terrible. So i bought coconut oil and let’s see whats change then.
9853 2018-10-19 18:01:51 my dumb question is why doesn't Imperial Oil just buy everything up (small and midcap)?

Exxon will go to all corners of the earth to find production, lots of it expensive and complex engineering
9854 2018-10-19 18:01:48 Gah! The “M-word”!
9855 2018-10-19 18:01:46 Venezulans are doing so well with their economy based on oil, they can buy a million gallons of gas or ONE loaf of bread to feed their families for the same $$. I’m sure most Venezuelans are buying oil. Oh wait...their money is frozen in banks that the gov won’t let them have.
9856 2018-10-19 18:01:46 Avoiding sunlight is the major thing. I just recently switched to a shea butter and coconut oil cleanser that I think is doing a better job than what I had before. Otherwise, I am shockingly lax in my skincare.
9857 2018-10-19 18:01:38 We won’t pump dirty oil?
9858 2018-10-19 18:01:20 The sad truth is: no one would give a fuck about Saudi Arabia if they hadn‘t so much oil.
9859 2018-10-19 18:01:14 Carpooling.
Now illegal political activity.
According to the people who happily accept $$$$$$$ from oil companies.

Coincidence??
9860 2018-10-19 18:01:12 Your entire spew is just bullshit and you know it. "Beto" is a nickname O'rouke's mother gave to him when he was just a child. Nothing he has proposed will "cripple Texas oil" as long as Americans need to put gas in their cars.

9864 2018-10-19 18:01:03 An officer was flagged down by a pedestrian on Delaware Avenue who reported a “strong odor” coming from a parking lot of a nearby restaurant. The officer discovered the odor was emanating from a leaking barrel of cooking oil and informed management, who promised to clean it up.

9866 2018-10-19 18:00:49 Ok I forgot to tell y’all how bomb my bf is .
I told him my oil light came on and we switched cars and he took it to get an oil change and got a car wash 
9867 2018-10-19 18:00:46 Yeah! It rains almost through out the year, with rich fertile land and literacy rate of 65%, i told governor Oparanya sometime back that agriculture is our "oil" all we need ,is to turn it into business, working with small scale farmers and turning them to SMes
9868 2018-10-19 18:00:44 Hiii, I can help, maybe! I just got a routine down that worked. exfoliation after skin stops being tender (2 days after wax max for me), then moisturize + antibacterial 2-3x a week (I use coconut oil mixed w/ a *bit* of tea tree oil but everyone’s skin can react differently)~
9869 2018-10-19 18:00:41 But that o3 - o6 ratio, massive....

Have you a chart that shows o3- o6 ratios across a range of Oils?

btw, love, love, love the flavour!
It's one kept in for a treat, just occasionally! I also use walnut oil, evoo rarely, not so enamoured with the flavour.

9884 2018-10-19 17:59:15 It’s weird, as the US is now a net crude oil exporter (and soon the world’s biggest producer).

9887 2018-10-19 17:58:53 Many shock absorbers contain pressurized nitrogen gas in them as well as the hydraulic oil. The up and down motion will create foam in hydraulic oil . This foam causes the shock to lose some of its control. The gas under pressure will prevent the shock oil from foaming .

The thing is that in 20 years it will be shut down anyway due to oil price collapse so we might as well start thinking abt it now.

9919 2018-10-19 17:55:41 The other day some people were surprised why i had not put a bottle of cooking oil in my basket. I told them i had a 2 litre bottle at home so i had to give others a chance to buy. They couldn't believe it.
9920 2018-10-19 17:55:40 If we don't shore up our relations with this Country they'll slide in tighter with Russia and we will be hearing more of these stories because I doubt they are as squimish but all too willing to protect them for oil NATO and other countries in the area need shifting power balance
9921 2018-10-19 17:55:22 Sorry to anyone that’s judging me but I dropped the whole pan on the floor, oil and steak splashing everywhere and I made a decision...5 second rule.

9945 2018-10-19 17:52:08 Yes, Eric. When your “friend” sends 9/11 terrorists to your country, murders a US resident & journalist, & whose only claim to world influence is based on oil money, yes, you do rethink that relationship. That assumes, of course, you value integrity over $$.
9946 2018-10-19 17:52:07 Canola oil an eggplant  and a copy of the passion of the Christ
9947 2018-10-19 17:52:06 Don't forget that Saudi Arabia flooding market with oil in 2014 driving the price of oil from over 100 to 26 for only 1 purpose - to destroy the US shale oil industry. They failed. Saudia Arabia is the most evil country on earth. They have destroyed Yemen.
9948 2018-10-19 17:51:59 Does castor oil really regrow hair?
9949 2018-10-19 17:51:52 Big chunk of pork shoulder, marinade in red wine vinegar, tomato, onion, garlic, orange peel, thyme. Heat oil and brown meat, add marinade, butter, mint leaves, honey, simmer & reduce to half. Lid on & chuck in high oven 2 hours. Back on hob, sieve bits out, reduce again -  
9950 2018-10-19 17:51:41 Their offering at 1.00 was just declared effective so those shareholders can sell now, although I really dont think they invested $40M for pennies. Fish oil just quiet for now, that will change 
9951 2018-10-19 17:51:41 someone give my car an oil change
9952 2018-10-19 17:51:41 Mariner East 2 delayed to 2020 #oil #natgas #shale #energy
9953 2018-10-19 17:51:37 And remember obama's red line? It's all about arms sales and oil anyway...
9954 2018-10-19 17:51:28 Arrrgghhhh !!! All that powder,oil ,mixed with Lagos dust ...? You just have to wash face first . The mask won’t penetrate the skill well ..
9955 2018-10-19 17:51:27 I can't deny he's kept peace in Korea and environmentally, aside from the PCA, he isn't doing awfully. Of course, he could do better, though. Everybody can. I'm not saying ban coal or oil, but we can instead use more eco friendly renewable sources such as solar energy.
9956 2018-10-19 17:51:22 They filter out oil rich Saudi royal families, and other nation state rulers like Putin, etc.
9957 2018-10-19 17:51:22 CBD oil is also something to try. Benefits of weed without the smoking part.
9958 2018-10-19 17:51:14 ค่าา
9959 2018-10-19 17:51:13 What's the difference between GOP and Alsaud? Those rich oil countries will stop at nothing to keep other arab countries under their pressure, even if it means creating as many yemens as it takes. We are fighting for feminism in america, yemenis are fighting war and femine.
9960 2018-10-19 17:51:00 Saudi oil is a better product than Canadian oil.
9961 2018-10-19 17:50:55 Reading comprehension doesnt appear to be your strong suit. I am against foreign adventurism, whether for oil or journalism. I don't believe we should send our men and women to die for other countries problems. Apparently, you do. Enjoy your endless wars.
9962 2018-10-19 17:50:53 I admire people with the self confidence to have a 15 minute conversation on their phone in front of the other 23 people who are also waiting for their oil change to be complete.
9963 2018-10-19 17:50:46 ได้ค่า เดี๋ยวเราจะถ่ายบรรยากาศลงงง เล่นกิจด้วยเลยยย 55555
9964 2018-10-19 17:50:42 It would be more effective to slap import duties on Saudi oil.  Irving's refineries in new Brunswick can find other sources. *cough* Canada *cough* *cough*
9965 2018-10-19 17:50:37 Ormai l’ho maxata! È fortissima in pvp 
Per ora Kaga/Akagi/Enterprise-Hood è il team per top rank 

E comunque, te l’ho detto, builda low oil... vuoi che ti spiego in dm?
9966 2018-10-19 17:50:29 Snake oil? 
9967 2018-10-19 17:50:28 Great Saudi Arabia can not be punished, we will make you live in the Middle Ages ، Without our oil you will ride horses

9970 2018-10-19 17:50:12 Fuck outta state oil fields !
9971 2018-10-19 17:50:10 Rick, you're in bed with oil and nuclear. Everyone knows that. It's hilarious that you head the dept you wanted to erase, had you only been able to remember its name. Well, not really funny, just ironically screwed up, like the rest of this admin.
9972 2018-10-19 17:50:10 Amin Ya Rabbi
9973 2018-10-19 17:50:09 7Your throne, O judge, [will exist] forever and ever; the scepter of equity is the scepter of your kingdom.
8You loved righteousness and you hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, anointed you with oil of joy from among your peers
9974 2018-10-19 17:50:09 Ooh! We could all wear donkey jackets and stand around fires in oil drums.
9975 2018-10-19 17:50:07 The mechanics at these oil places are always trying to get a extra penny
9976 2018-10-19 17:50:05 ค่าา อาจจะเจอกันแต่ไม่รู้คนไหน ใครเป็นใคร 555555
9977 2018-10-19 17:50:02 Dr k was such a great Sec of State, when the Arabs got oil near $40 in 1975, he threatened to invade and take over the oil fields. Just sayin’, if SA retaliation does take oil to 200, his advice is out there already.
9978 2018-10-19 17:50:02 Ted Cruz is going to nationalize the oil industry?
9979 2018-10-19 17:50:01 Congrats on making zero sense.
Gov't taking control of the oil in Venezuela is what caused their implosion. Getting away from oil would help how?
9980 2018-10-19 17:49:57 Bruh... you threw it into a pan filled with cold oil. Lmao
9981 2018-10-19 17:49:54 I will stick to snake oil
9982 2018-10-19 17:49:51 Why must an oil change cost so much money. I don’t want to adult anymore.
9983 2018-10-19 17:49:34 Govt Ki 10 Roza Deadline Khatam Honay Per Oil Tankers Association Ka Itwaar Se Mulk Bhar Me Hartaal Or Oil Ki Supply Band Kernay Ka Elaan.
9984 2018-10-19 17:49:33 U.S. Federal Reserve officials are monitoring the case of missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the possibility that any sanctions against Saudi Arabia could disrupt oil markets, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said on Friday.
9985 2018-10-19 17:49:13 引火したら、もう手遅れさ…
9986 2018-10-19 17:49:07 I think we are just desperate. A heavy hand is unnecessary. If the cooking oil and the fuel were freely available at a stable price with no publicity stunts and gimmicks everyone would do the right thing. No one wants to relive 2008 so everyone is gearing up for survival.
9987 2018-10-19 17:48:54 Swear that pigtail oil down from El Pecos is 
9988 2018-10-19 17:48:39 Cantu leave in conditioner, aloe Vera gel mixed with olive oil and @taliahwaajid curly curl cream
9989 2018-10-19 17:48:35 Problem is Carl, running costs of renewable is higher than oil. (See EST website) that's why it is a dilemma. Lifetime costs also higher with renewable, that's why Govt offer a subsidy. Do u just make up "facts"?
9990 2018-10-19 17:48:25 Great. Now my twitter ads are all Pharma and @Chevron (the oil company, not the #administrativelaw doctrine). Thanks, #FDAConf18.
9991 2018-10-19 17:48:25 There is nearly 200hp to be unlocked in these old oil boilers mate 
9992 2018-10-19 17:48:15 LOL - I wish. My "shoulder day" is now about 5 minutes with a PT rubber band. Surgery next Wed, then 4 weeks in a perpendicular brace. Take care of those rotator cuffs. @denise_masino
9993 2018-10-19 17:48:14 It's more that I am very sensitive to strong smells.. gives me headache but I've tried CBD oil before and its helped me, just need to be able to afford the one with no flavour added but so expensive
9994 2018-10-19 17:47:57 นอนเถอะ
9995 2018-10-19 17:47:56 Yes really is insane. A disgrace, but just follow the money . Added to the the fact the govs have decimated UK oil production in past 20 years. We still use oil of course, we just now get loads of it from abroad, for more money. We used to be near self-sufficient.
9996 2018-10-19 17:47:43 Petroleum is a bit old school. Most would call them selves energy companies now. Think you would find most support climate change, as either way they win. Oil prices go up they win, or energy demand increases. They win.
9997 2018-10-19 17:47:39 Happy  weekend everyone.  Its time to fuel up. Join a strategic queue for your fuel. Either woke up early or sleep late to get that fuel. Make sure you delegate the cooking oil and gas queue to every able bodied person in your hse.  Welcome to Zimbabwe 
9998 2018-10-19 17:47:18 Try olive oil!!!
9999 2018-10-19 17:47:18 Coconut oil mask before you wash your hair
10000 2018-10-19 17:47:11 Trump tricked you into admitting the Democrats want to curtail oil exploration and development, increasing price at the pump and destroying jobs. #superpower
10001 2018-10-19 17:46:54 Use that growth oil from nativechild
10002 2018-10-19 17:46:47 The fact that Goa was under the reigns of Portuguese for a prolonged period, its impact can still be seen in the food and cuisines. Konkan Hindu and Goan Catholic have evolved Goan dishes over the years and the heavy use of coconut oil in these dishes are a noticeable feature.
10003 2018-10-19 17:46:46 Proverbs 5:3-5 
For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:
But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.
Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.

10005 2018-10-19 17:46:42 Bc our government is owned by oil
10006 2018-10-19 17:46:37 Haitians Want to Know What the Government Has Done with Missing Oil Money
10007 2018-10-19 17:46:37 October 19 1987 - The United States Navy conducts Operation Nimble Archer, an attack on two Iranian oil platforms in the Persian Gulf
10008 2018-10-19 17:46:36 Another with that kind of oil in water looking paint, nice.

10010 2018-10-19 17:46:33 Oil prices rise towards $85 on surprise drawdown in US crude stockpiles
10011 2018-10-19 17:46:05 THIS CAR STINKS LIKE OIL. BETTER TRY TO FIX IT WITH MY FARTS AND ASS STANK. *moans involentarily*
10012 2018-10-19 17:46:00 vote no .... fracking Is banded...zero oil production is going too far.... don’t be fooled people....
10013 2018-10-19 17:45:53 I used those products regularly and loved @cvspharmacy for selling them.  It’s sad to hear that you no longer carry them for more up to date beauty offerings.  You still carry Oil of Olay among many other things my grandmother used yeaaaars ago. 
10014 2018-10-19 17:45:47 Blend 1 pound cheese with 11 lbs grapes. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Stir-fry. Serve for brunch
10015 2018-10-19 17:45:46 Oh, good! I know colds can sometimes take forever to shake off. BTW, which essential oil did you use? I might try that the next time I strain my voice from teaching. Take care!
10016 2018-10-19 17:45:44 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.
10017 2018-10-19 17:45:37 yeh millennials have the power to kill entire industries and they're choosing mayonnaise and golf instead of coal n oil smh
10018 2018-10-19 17:45:36 Sebelum tidur pakai argan oil sephia nih. Tidur dengan lena.
10019 2018-10-19 17:45:31 US voters supporting socialist democrats should take a trip to Venezuela to witness the failures involved with socialist policies. The Hollywood liberals used to celebrate Venezuelan socialism and now they are silent as the country with largest oil reserves declines into poverty!
10020 2018-10-19 17:45:31 really jus poured oil all over my engine my shit gon be smokin like a mf when i start it up
10021 2018-10-19 17:45:30 Slither back under your rock junior snake oil salesman!
10022 2018-10-19 17:45:29 Young lady, This wee country of ours has been subsidising England for many years in many areas, health being a good example. Also there is the small matter of the 'lost' oil revenues which of course the Westminster have looked after so carefully. Sarcasm is a bugger, is it not?
10023 2018-10-19 17:45:27 One of the goals of this administration; diversify the economy by investing in agriculture, hence the anchor borrowers program for rice farmers. What has been done for Cocoa & oil palm farmers in the South?
Is @MBuhari investing in agriculture or just investing in the North?
10024 2018-10-19 17:45:25 "God is greater than our impoverishments of mind and spirit. He brings beauty out of ashes. He gives the oil of joy for mourning. He gives the garment of praise for a spirit of heaviness." —Alistair Begg
10025 2018-10-19 17:45:24 I use topical cbd oil and I take plenty of aleve!
10026 2018-10-19 17:45:19 Truer words back never been spoken 
10027 2018-10-19 17:45:12 Nordic countries had a huge windfall of money in oil resources to start with as well
10028 2018-10-19 17:45:02 I hate being an adult. Doing adult things like get my oil changed...why does it gotta take an hour? Just do mine nowwwwww 
10029 2018-10-19 17:44:53 The Khashoggi farce is such a laughable joke of an attempt to manipulate oil prices higher. These fraudsters failed in their lavish attempt to manipulate the price of oil. What a riot!
