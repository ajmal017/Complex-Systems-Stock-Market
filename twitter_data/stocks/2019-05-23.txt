4 2019-05-23 23:56:21 I’m a crypto follower and the recent addition of tweets for one off stocks is blowing up my notifications. I’m considering turning off notifications. Others may be thinking the same. Something to consider. Keep up the good work nonetheless

11 2019-05-23 23:52:21 I think Elon was close to a Margin call... 
1)Exercised 175,000 shares
2)Begs employees not to sell (while insiders/funds have been unloading)
Neither work
3)Leaks a material “internal email” right before the market is open and stocks down ~5%

13 2019-05-23 23:50:37 Speaking of brand, I'm going to launch a YouTube channel of brash, Barstool-esque reviews but of stocks and trades, instead of pizza, and show how agonizingly frustrating and/or euphoria-inducing stock trading actually is

16 2019-05-23 23:47:49 Can high yielding domestic oriented stocks weather the trade war sell off with RBA cuts in sight and lower deposit rates. e.g.asx mms, clh, ax1, banks, staples, reits

18 2019-05-23 23:45:22 They might be playing a version of melee called Chess Melee where every stock resets. He still has all 4 stocks, but the game returns to neutral.
