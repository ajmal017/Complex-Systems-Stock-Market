2 2018-06-28 23:59:15 Does this mean US will go to war now with Venezuela to stop their selling oil to China outside the US petro dollar, or are Venezuelans going to flood the US?

7 2018-06-28 23:58:39 Damn. I stopped doing my own oil changes when I got this car. Also, my jack can’t lift my new car up high enough. Only enough to change a tire. Thanks tho.
8 2018-06-28 23:58:27 Exactly!  India's dependence on Arabic countries for oil will be drastically reduced once India will be able to introduce electric vehicles.  And regarding dependence on America, well, India can take a clue ! China is expert in Reverse Engineering,  or, simply copying! (1)

13 2018-06-28 23:57:42 Lord Downer should be answering questions in The Hague not these worthy two in an Australian court. Australia spying on East Timor ahead of oil negotiations is shameful. Charging Witness K and lawyer is wicked. Disgusting! Thankyou for raising this in Parliament.

38 2018-06-28 23:56:27 Would have been better if the divisions done in early 1900 in ME had been done for the people's benefit rather than the EU ruling class. KSA, Turkey, Iran, Isreal are an artificial mess propped up by EU tradition and oil money. They generate problems like ISIS.
39 2018-06-28 23:56:15 Do you know why tires are black? It's because of an additive called "carbon black" (made from burning oil) which is added to the rubber to reinforce it. Carbon black is also used in printer ink and plastics (which are also made from oil.)

44 2018-06-28 23:55:00 But it's exactly like yall became the richest by taking Iraqi oil. The Panama Canal amd don't forget about rest of the oil industry in the Arab Gulf +the whole " powerful thing" that just killing brown ppl"savages and terrorism" . Not easy but not smart either.
45 2018-06-28 23:54:45 Tell me about it. MPAs don't stop things like oil coming in but they can stop issues like oil leaks and spills  originating there
46 2018-06-28 23:54:30 タクシーで想定と違う駅に連れていかれて戸惑いました……
47 2018-06-28 23:54:26 I agree with all of this. I personally use jojoba or argon oil for my moisturizer tho.
48 2018-06-28 23:54:08 だれがおじさんや！！！
49 2018-06-28 23:54:00 This is more than the oil revenue. It’s EU/African/Asian businesses who are also leaving Iran. Trump is strong handing companies to take their FDIs out of Iran. Major car companies such as Peugeot have already stopped business in Iran.
50 2018-06-28 23:53:55 I give treats to my dog made from hemp oil to help him with his arthritis wracked body...it works!!
51 2018-06-28 23:53:55 Who said anything about setting oil prices. The North sea is a reserved matter to WM. Scotgov has no control over North Sea. Read the fuckin tweet!! FFS!
52 2018-06-28 23:53:47 Right??? Nope! Not on my watch!

ナスにはナスニン、ﾎﾟﾘﾌｪﾉｰﾙが含まれており抗酸化作用がある様です。
また、カリウムも多く余分な塩分、熱を排除し利尿効果もあるそうですよ
55 2018-06-28 23:53:32 Sherif Clarke, I am a loyal follower of yours. My daughter just passed away from a genetic disorder at 8.5 months that the drs thought would take her in 4. The reason is CBD oil derived from marijuana. Please don’t condemn this as a treatment
56 2018-06-28 23:53:22 If you fry your corn tortilla in olive oil is that still somewhat healthy?!?.... asking for a friend 
57 2018-06-28 23:53:07 What a prediction, a USA based pipeline company is going to build another pipeline. Very surprising! Also, one is oil going to west coast tide waters, which Canada NEEDS. The new pipeline is GAS. I hate Trudeau but know the difference.
58 2018-06-28 23:53:03 Gua serinh kyk gitu, kleveru oil gaada alkoholnya jd kebuka dikit gabakal nguap:')

66 2018-06-28 23:51:42 -both entered a wrestling mat filled with oil-
67 2018-06-28 23:51:41 Only if you have an extremely narrow definition of trade. 

Do you mean raw materials we sell like like oil or gas, or farming stuff like wheat or apples, or making things & selling them, or creative things like music & computer games, or buying investments. S’all trade innit?
68 2018-06-28 23:51:33 It won't be able to in a way to grab sizable market share. Otherwise everybody knows it will find it's way to the markets through backdoor channels with a serious discount.

I almost sold a guy headlight fluid once but he went outside and checked his lights and said he will wait till the next oil change.... XD

72 2018-06-28 23:50:55 Somebody need to come put oil in my hair
73 2018-06-28 23:50:45 Great to hear that. I hadn't checked. I intended to check your speeds via computer but I didn't get a chance to check.
74 2018-06-28 23:50:42 Awesome lol, my dads been looking for good olive oil to use. Yooo cooked minced garlic way out does powedered garlic in my opinion. Powdered garlic can get bitter tbh.
75 2018-06-28 23:50:39 got some cbd oil for banks and every time I give it to her balor just tried to lick it out of her mouth 
76 2018-06-28 23:50:37 What medium are you using? Still the coloured pencil? Looks great :D
77 2018-06-28 23:50:04 Oil Catch Can installed ....check
78 2018-06-28 23:50:02 question is bjp blamed congress and MMS for rupee value depreciation in 2013 hiding all other facts. Now, they’re finding reasons to cover up the issue. Oil price is the key reason for this fall then and now. But the difference is $20+/barrel still rupee depreciated to 2013 lvls

80 2018-06-28 23:49:45 Example of capitalism at its finest. Examples: B.C. continues to approve wolf culls as a means to recover caribou when fragmentation of habitat by forestry and oil and gas interests is to blame for both decreased numbers and increased predation
81 2018-06-28 23:49:39 Lord Downer should be answering questions in The Hague not these worthy two in an Australian court. Australia spying on East Timor ahead of oil negotiations is shameful. Charging Witness K and lawyer is wicked. Disgusting!

83 2018-06-28 23:49:08 Bertolli extra virgin olive oil. I prefer to mince fresh garlic and cook it in the olive oil for a few minutes then dump the pasta in but that's "too stinky" for my kid so I use powdered. Mine is super stinky, his is "just a little stinky".
84 2018-06-28 23:48:52 That's... Definitely not true. At least not from where I'm sitting.
85 2018-06-28 23:48:52 CBD oil is said to be very helpful at keeping pets calm during fireworks.

88 2018-06-28 23:48:17 Maduro will wipe his a$$ with what any U.S. official says especially Pence & his boss. The U.S. was too busy trying to keep the oil coming than to help take down dictator Chavez & now Maduro.
89 2018-06-28 23:48:02 not a canadian company, first to move south. 25% auto tariffs, no Alberta oil in eastern Canada.
90 2018-06-28 23:47:59 staying late at work and someone just asked me if I was "burning the midnight oil" #TBT to IBT and my good people @CharlieAllDay and @TBarrabi #IBTWTF its only 7:47 p.m.
91 2018-06-28 23:47:50 That's what Nestle does. One well, one lake at a time. Until the USA has no more water. It's the new oil.

95 2018-06-28 23:47:25 But not a snake oil salesmen. He left in 2017. 
96 2018-06-28 23:47:16 Oilを垂らしてくれ 軽蔑に値する
97 2018-06-28 23:47:13 Says the guy who peddles conspiracies and false narratives by the minute. Keep selling the snake oil dude.

101 2018-06-28 23:47:07 昨日、ベロンベロンの酔っぱらい二人をそれぞれの家に送り届けて、最寄りの駅まそのタクシーで帰ったんだけど、金払って降りたら隣の駅だった話しします？？？
102 2018-06-28 23:47:04 あーいう女はねぇ、結婚しても自分が上手くいってないと「あの人も上手くいってないはず。私が助けてあげなきゃ・・・」みたいな思考になってヨソの家庭（たとえ我を隠して穏便に過ごしていたとしても）をかき乱すのよね。
103 2018-06-28 23:46:52 My skin lovessss avocado oil. 
It’s a bit too heavy for the current weather but whenever I try another oil my skin looks at me like BITCH...you’re nothing
104 2018-06-28 23:46:51 New high or low: went to the sketchy Dollar Deluxe store by my house and resisted the urge to buy really cheap, slightly expired olive oil.
105 2018-06-28 23:46:38 Chef Kawasaki cut up some bars of soap, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a blue stop sign, along with sushi.
106 2018-06-28 23:46:35 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
107 2018-06-28 23:46:30 Reading these replies, you all sound like trump supporters, this is exact how they talk with no substance & nothing to back up their claims. She was one of the very few people with a platform who protested standing rock and took on the oil industry
108 2018-06-28 23:46:28 Drill for Oil!
109 2018-06-28 23:46:23 literally at 35 weeks! twice orally and then you can puncture one and squeeze the oil out of it and put it down there. i was 2cm dialated at my 37 week checkup on a monday and went into labor the next day lol!
110 2018-06-28 23:46:20 I make fried potatos in olive oil but it takes foreveeer to cook
111 2018-06-28 23:46:18 ありがとうございます！！
112 2018-06-28 23:46:11 I rub that oil all over my body.
113 2018-06-28 23:46:06 Time to go oil free

120 2018-06-28 23:45:04 Now I know to never go to a @jiffylube ever again for car services. Payed almost $100 for an oil change only for a mechanic to tell me it’s as if my car never had one.. I got one three weeks ago!
121 2018-06-28 23:44:52 I watched my Husband at46 Diagnosed with Mesthelomia Go Through Hell& Pain. Died at 50. My Dad At same time 71, Pancreas Cancer Of Horrible Deaths From Same Oil Company. I Recieved Nothing From Them. “They were not Responsible. But if a Different# Yes! Makes me sick! H.S. SweetH.
122 2018-06-28 23:44:48 All canola oil is GMO'd
123 2018-06-28 23:44:45 Yay! So the oil patch can apply for the increased cost of tubulars right? #AskingForAFriend
124 2018-06-28 23:44:42 oil hits highest levels since + 2014 !
125 2018-06-28 23:44:39 That was my reason for Twitter also but I've been involved politics for yrs cause of the oil/gas fields & other reasons. I just smh at the stupidity of some ppl on here.  Can't believe MSNBC is taking over the race coverage now. Dale Jr shoulda went to FS1 IMO
126 2018-06-28 23:44:30 Yes.
127 2018-06-28 23:44:29 If i ever walk in on my man cheating on me in my house, im walking straight to the kitchen and boiling 2 pots of vegetable oil
128 2018-06-28 23:44:28 I haven’t had to pay for an oil change in 4 years...I’m not ready
129 2018-06-28 23:44:10 ? WTF is wrong with this country?  Why are we paying other countries for oil & gas when we are swimming in it?  Global emissions increase when we import from other countries instead of developing and using our own.  Do we benefit when we lose our oil and gas workers to others?
130 2018-06-28 23:43:49 It’s basically eggs ppl r annoying lol and if it’s vegan it’s literally oil whipped up 
131 2018-06-28 23:43:38 making body scrubs out of olive oil and coffee grounds has lightened my stretch marks I love exfoliating!!!
132 2018-06-28 23:43:34 Total crap. 

The Iraqi insurgents certainly understood what you did. 

And we’ve used it on our adversaries

Hell, the apotheosis of this was the WWII bombing campaign against ball bearing factories & oil refineries. 

Sub attacks on Japanese supply ships
133 2018-06-28 23:43:30 the trump admin. has proposed oil drilling near the great sand dunes nat’l park in CO, a 35 min drive from my mums hometown. i am completely disgusted, as this proposal could ruin the natural ecosystem - trumps complete disregard for natural life and local citizens is DISGUSTING.
134 2018-06-28 23:43:30 am so sick of the smell of tea tree oil
135 2018-06-28 23:43:20 Oh my goodness! And you are even contesting for political office? A fool like you?... Chei, we don finish for this country oo.
136 2018-06-28 23:43:14 Part of it is just the accumulated IOUs from their trade surplus with the US. In the case of Brazil, its mostly from selling oil for USD and then just keeping the USD. The US finl empire probably has their own ppl in these central banks. So that eliminates gold.

142 2018-06-28 23:42:37 Remember fellas, rub almond oil over your hairline after you get a haircut.
143 2018-06-28 23:42:13 This moisturizer feels soooo good on my hair . Just using oil wasn’t cutting it.
144 2018-06-28 23:41:54 For some reason folks can't or won't look at history and see that this has happened many times before. Google, Microsoft, Walmart, and even Standard Oil, never took over the world. Physics will only let stuff get so big before reversing course.
145 2018-06-28 23:41:48 aloe vera and castor oil really did push my hair growth 
146 2018-06-28 23:41:40 I can’t wait to cast my vote for Trump again!! Best choice I’ve ever made.
Honestly Bush and Obama were the worst for this country. One had to help out his oil buddies and the other one wanted to give our country away.

148 2018-06-28 23:41:33 Cbd oil has changed my life. I feel like actually start to live again. The most significant difference I've noticed is little shit does not trigger me like it used to; I don't give my insecurities and/or people's words + actions as much power to rent space in my head anymore.

150 2018-06-28 23:41:22 Oil, or fuel tanker?  That’s a lot of burnt stuff to be just oil.
151 2018-06-28 23:41:07 just one snake oil salesman being replaced by another. Senators just nod and blink - @auspost said it it must be true. What a clueless mob of out of touch representives
152 2018-06-28 23:41:04 What Democratic Senators can do in the real world:
Deny unanimous consent. To everything.
Unanimous Consent is the oil that keeps the moving parts in Senate moving.

175 2018-06-28 23:39:22 Most of everything in your life requires oil and coal for its production. More that you realize, I'm sure. The average tire you put on your environmentally friendly electric car took almost 20 gallons of oil to produce, not to mention the coal burned to charge it up.

185 2018-06-28 23:37:20 Master negotiator?  Bwahahaha! 

He gave Kim Jong-Un a meeting and cancelled military readiness training AND GOT NOTHING in return.  He cancelled the Iran agreement such that we can no longer inspect Iran nuke sites, the can resume building bombs, and the price of oil shot up!
186 2018-06-28 23:37:05 Our oil money was looted by foreigners who left behind no infrastructure of worth. A few Venezuelans grew wealthy but many folks looking for work in Caracas wound up in _ranchitos_, shanty homes built up the Avila. Then OPEC pulled the rug out on oil prices, now everyone’s broke.

189 2018-06-28 23:36:38 Youre lying — you’re pushing further US dependence on coal & oil which will destroy us in the end & make you a boatload of money in the short run. Soros, Steyer, Bloomberg and other liberal activists are pushing policies of clean energy — for the future.

221 2018-06-28 23:31:07 Oh good lord. And those interests are stealing the oil, turning the entire middle-east into  Libya/Iraq-style failed states and breaking Syria up to hand off to our pet dictatorships. Frankly, damaging American interests is the best thing that can happen to Syria.

233 2018-06-28 23:29:35 No specific sites to recommend... but, substitute splenda for sugar unless baking; then half and half.  substitute unsweetened applesauce for oil if baking.  substitute 1% milk (unless you can deal with skim).  those are my personal guidelines.

OTOH my favorite pasta sauce is probably just parm, pepper, and garlic in oil so pretty tough to beat that.

238 2018-06-28 23:28:10 The issue with oil is how much tax revenue it brings in. At present, it is pretty much none. You iScotland would have been scuppered - Eck promised you billions from oil, and it simply is not there. Don’t you k ow this? Anyone with sense does.

276 2018-06-28 23:22:15 Qatar 'must stop support for terror', top UN court told - I don't believe Qatar is supporting terror.  They have an oil field they share with Iran - & r friendly with Iran - that does not indicate Qatar is funding terrorism.  I believe Saudi wants to take control of Qatar.
277 2018-06-28 23:22:15 Even so, my own modeling of primary energy also suggests that fossil fuel consumption will peak by 2022. Also projecting coal, oil, and gas to peak in 2013, 2023 and 2024, respectively. This is by sheer displacement and logit share trends.

291 2018-06-28 23:19:26 I guess Brexit would make sense if the UK had, say, huge oil reserves unique to Europe, and the rest of the EU had to come to us for oil no matter what. But we don't. Our economy is services-based. If we deliberately make the services cheaper and easier to obtain elsewhere...

300 2018-06-28 23:17:52 How makeup sucks and is hard to buy/find the right colors. How hard it is to eat right when fries are delicious. The moral struggle of buying stuff made from animals or products containing Palm Oil that is destroying Indonesia.

302 2018-06-28 23:17:23 Spend 50% of this budget on the country’s infrastructure, schools (pre - doctorate), health of every person of this nation - then there will be a difference.
But we all know those lobbyists don’t pay you guys like the military, coal, oil & gas do.

310 2018-06-28 23:16:11 High oil prices will: 1) increase CA deficit so depreciation is needed to narrow it. 2) increase inflation appreciating the real ER. Model still holds and tells you INR needs to fall to adjust to high oil
311 2018-06-28 23:16:06 I can’t believe I spent my whole day waiting here to get an oil change I’m trippen
312 2018-06-28 23:16:02 I think it's forte oil
313 2018-06-28 23:16:00 So true which is even more insidious when an evil individual pretends to care for them and sells them snake oil!

321 2018-06-28 23:15:09 Hard to say. I don't really trade oil. The oil market is much harder to trade than stocks.
322 2018-06-28 23:15:08 There are only a handful of GM's that could turn this into a positive and none of them are employed by the Oilers... I suspect all this rumour of him moving amounts to nothing. Possibly oil generated. Likely all they are hearing is shit for shit.

326 2018-06-28 23:14:13 Yea you're right.  Now instead of Tigre taking the oil out of Ogaden, now Oromos are taking it.  and Ogadenis remaining poor and exploited 
327 2018-06-28 23:14:01 Prisons are for slave labour industry,nah they will do the same as with Hillary,talk loads of lies & go on about locking him up and nothing will be done but distracting from what's really happening,Alex the snake oil salesman,promoting his health products while he's clearly obese
328 2018-06-28 23:13:58 Interesting. I have cannacoconut oil in the fridge right now. Never thought of putting it in my nether regions, though. I just eat it. Boring!!!

336 2018-06-28 23:13:02 Actually, Israel’s economy was based on a socialist model until the Yom Kippur war and when oil prices went up. In the new Yishuv, the society was organised with a set of socialist values (and kibbutzim are only one example).

338 2018-06-28 23:12:44 Tea tree oil and paw paw ointment
339 2018-06-28 23:12:29 The point. Allow provinces to invest in clean energy and create jobs outside oil. An investment like that could  help lead sask into a new Industry not a make work in my opinion.  High CO2 emitters would get the penalty so you wouldn’t get back =. Incentives tied in.
340 2018-06-28 23:12:21 Same, Jordo, Same  I've gone oil free, but if I must use oil, I use the spray kind so I don't have to DUMP it in the pan

379 2018-06-28 23:07:20 They import oil from Canada & refine it here in USA, it probably doesn't sit well with them because of the Tariffs.  Koch Brothers are Rich enough.  Millions could feed the hungry here in the USA instead of wasting it on a dying party.

433 2018-06-28 22:59:04 what are 100$ to red mercy?
@redmercy could you enlighten us?
i thought 100$ meant free premium oil for your car and less things to worry about
the same as every other human
434 2018-06-28 22:59:03 wow idk her but I miss her (soup) too.. that sounds amazing .. my mom makes something similar but with diff veggie & it’s so nice! I love sesame oil
435 2018-06-28 22:59:01 The wages were as they should have been. The issue is with the Wood Gps of this world using the downturn as an excuse to cut wages and t & cs. The oil companies retracted knowing full well it was going to get better again but the workers suffer in the meantime.
436 2018-06-28 22:58:36 He's doing a great job if you're an oil company, private jet owner, or prejudiced against latino people. Not gonna assume which one of those categories you belong to.
437 2018-06-28 22:58:35 Like why do I even wear makeup in the summer? My face is like an oil slick right now.
438 2018-06-28 22:58:23 My mom’s pasta salad be so simple yet so good to me. Its just Rotini pasta, tomatoes, onions tossed in some olive oil I think with proper seasonings but shit be hitting on hard to me. Perfect side dish. Any kind of protein + rice with it and it’s a top 10 meal for me. lol
439 2018-06-28 22:58:16 Until "du pont" and the oil guys in tow with the government demonized it.... It makes you think too clearly for those greedy bastards also.
440 2018-06-28 22:58:13 I had something like that happen to me before. I asked the garage to change my oil while it was in for inspection. The only thing they did was reset change oil message, as if they changed the oil. A new (used) engine later, I no longer take my cars to that garage.
441 2018-06-28 22:58:12 I love when im cooking and oil starts popping in my face :^)
442 2018-06-28 22:58:08 Very few players go multiple seasons without an injury. While there are some, it’s not the norm.
443 2018-06-28 22:58:08 I volunteer to oil those and put sunblock on them 
444 2018-06-28 22:57:57 Condolences to all who lost someone in the oil tanker mishap
445 2018-06-28 22:57:53 me dieron otra estrategia de detox: Castor oil packs, en youtube encontré varias formas de hacerlos.
446 2018-06-28 22:57:50 I've been debating the horror of having to make the effort to wash my hair everyday because I've obviously been sleeping in a vat of oil inside a furnace.

449 2018-06-28 22:57:14 I get an oil change almost every month 
450 2018-06-28 22:56:57 ふぁああああ会いたい。ほんと会いたい。
451 2018-06-28 22:56:45 I'm watching the very entertaining debate on Fox News between Ron Desantis and Adam Putnam. Desantis seems to come off as more genuine, legitimately pro-Trump, and a good guy. Adam Putnam seems like a snake oil salesman who will say anything to win even if he doesn't believe it.
452 2018-06-28 22:56:42 Like the offshore oil rig with a Krusty Burger?
453 2018-06-28 22:56:38 Interesting. Has no idea Canadians were facing a food crisis and an oil embargo
454 2018-06-28 22:56:35 そうかもしれない（まだ分かってない）
455 2018-06-28 22:56:04 Finally doing an oil change on the whip
456 2018-06-28 22:56:02 I live in Dornoch, the plan is a disasterous vanity project by outsiders. Cheviot, Deer, Grouse, Oil, now Golf.  Keep our natural heritage from outside exploitation.
457 2018-06-28 22:55:34 There are many variables which are beyond the control of caretaker set up. The rupee had to be devalued given the pressure it was facing. The issue got from bad to worse due to current account deficit and the rising oil prices. Goverment has to make payments on three cases
458 2018-06-28 22:55:17 100 squats: check
Oil changed: check
Running shoes bought: check
Additional decorations for the house bought: check
Found out the compressor is bad in the AC in my car: check
459 2018-06-28 22:55:14 im almost done w my laundry, i changed my breaks, recharged my a/c, and did an oil change. i have been so productive and its not even my day off
460 2018-06-28 22:55:13 Don't see how that is a stretch.
461 2018-06-28 22:55:00 im going to a show tonight, can we go tomorrow night
462 2018-06-28 22:54:41 前の会社の社長も、効率が悪いとか、タラタラやってる(怒)・・と、まで言ってましたね。
その結果、主力の社員は殆ど辞めて、残り数人。
いつまで保つのやら・・。
463 2018-06-28 22:54:37 Every abnormal thing have been normalized in Nigeria. Why should a tanker still be carrying petrol upandan on the busiest road in west Africa ?  This is 2018, Nigeria is not the only country that has crude oil!!! . 
That’s why there is a field called Health, safety & environment
464 2018-06-28 22:54:14 Ever hear the story about the student who mistook optical adhesive for immersion oil. ???!
465 2018-06-28 22:54:14 実質的に「運動」って意味になってるから…"e-sports"って単語を直輸入したやつが無能すぎるのが悪い

467 2018-06-28 22:53:46 Whenever I get cigarettes from my local Luke oil, the cashier always tells me “ you look 16 Hahahah”
468 2018-06-28 22:53:45 You’re expecting MCDavid to have two consecutive injury free seasons? I wouldn’t bet on it.
469 2018-06-28 22:53:31 In five months he should have been able to verify what he's posting
470 2018-06-28 22:53:30 When I’m done w my cat do u wanna go to Michaels
471 2018-06-28 22:53:22 If they stay healthy I think they could hit closer to the 245-250 range from a season ago. That said, not sure how many they'll keep out of their net.
472 2018-06-28 22:53:20 Ok let me know how it goes! Also Essential oils are expensive and very strong so I dilute it a bottle (glass -usually a small roller) with fractionated coconut oil
473 2018-06-28 22:53:10 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.
474 2018-06-28 22:53:07 ;;;;))))
475 2018-06-28 22:52:58 When you go in for a $15 oil change and come out paying over $600 for four new tires 
476 2018-06-28 22:52:55 Seems to be down to the Scots hoping for a rare warm summer, and inflated oil prices thanks to the deflated pound and OPEC helping the oil industry a bit.
Both temporary.
Clutching on to straws Tina.
477 2018-06-28 22:52:45 About to put coconut oil in my hair be back when I’m new
478 2018-06-28 22:52:29 Ever hear of the "Purple Party Starter?" Rochester's 7g oil and kief covered master joint?! Rolled to perfection, and only $60! GreenWorks<3
479 2018-06-28 22:52:24 Has your skin always been oily? I thought mines was oily for so long but in the mainland my skin was so dry it was producing oil. So I switched to products for dry skin slowly and it dr wonders for me!
480 2018-06-28 22:52:20 @helveticaluvr hey ;)
481 2018-06-28 22:52:20 Sorry: oil immersion.
482 2018-06-28 22:52:18 IDK which sanghi said that !!

BTW Indian civilization and culture is more about being nature friendly. Steam engine is run on coal, wood or oil and light bulb is powered by electricity which is again up until recently was produced by burning coal !!

#GetABrain
483 2018-06-28 22:52:12 You might be using the oil for other things?
484 2018-06-28 22:51:55 Pffff....years ago had to explain to someone that an inversion objective does not mean immersing the whole think in 1.518 oil. Was wondering where all the oil squirt bottles (Zeiss) were all gone. They were emptied in a beaker....
485 2018-06-28 22:51:53 Oh wow is that oil paints? I really love that contrast and the texture it seems to have
486 2018-06-28 22:51:50 Cause you prob go to an oil change place that drives up selling
487 2018-06-28 22:51:36 I hear coconut oil is good.
488 2018-06-28 22:51:34 Azzin
Same thing we have done with every good thing e.g crude oil.
Our case is pathetic.
489 2018-06-28 22:51:05 They were actually apprehended ,but its not of recent,close to 5 months
490 2018-06-28 22:50:34 I think I actually put too much peppermint essential oil in my aroma thing. I have a headache lmao
491 2018-06-28 22:50:29 Well when I get itchy from shaving I dab a little lavender oil there and it usually helps. If I know I will get itchy there I do it right after getting out of the shower, you know while getting dressed. But the most important thing is that you use high quality oils.
492 2018-06-28 22:50:17 Does anybody really get their oil changed on time? I mean REALLY
493 2018-06-28 22:50:15 waiting 4 my hair 2 grow so i can cut off the blond bits cus in summer it gets so dry n nitty cus coconut oil evaporates or some shit but if i take it off now i’ll look like a bullet
494 2018-06-28 22:50:12 SNAPSHOT | Oil climbed higher in the NY morning, up about 0.7%. US equities found some support, while Europe played catch-up to the afternoon sell-off the day before. Emerging market currencies remained under pressure. @ANZ_Research $CL_F $SPX $USDCNH -- #OOTT #Stocks #FX
495 2018-06-28 22:50:10 I just made my own lip balm with shea butter, peppermint and coconut oil.
496 2018-06-28 22:50:09 Gotta go read my revelation again, need to check the part that said, "an oil tanker will spoil fuel and explode killing over 50+ Nigerians on the 28th of June 2018"...how could have I missed that. We worship one God dear and he isn't the author of confusion..
497 2018-06-28 22:50:06 I wonder what we would do when crude oil dries up.
498 2018-06-28 22:49:56 There should be more warnings such as Aveeno certain sunscreens are made with a nut derived oil and “nut free” places need to be aware so as to avoid this sunscreen. Very few people know this but I have learned this and share with friend& coworkers and families.
499 2018-06-28 22:49:52 “how do you get an essential oil?”
-sammie schwab
500 2018-06-28 22:49:47 I really feel bad for all the people he scammed. Even if by some miracle the market has a 65% loss, his fund would still be down -2% avg annual rate.  People have been looking at numbers and patterns for decades. His "research" is just snake oil and nothing more.
501 2018-06-28 22:49:39 i mis read this i will love to read with u,
502 2018-06-28 22:49:34 @adamputnam @RepDeSantis @realDonaldTrump @BretBaier @marthamaccallum Well, as a brand new @FloridaGOP resident, I can assure you I chose DeSantis immediately. Adam sells snake oil. From the very first response...

503 2018-06-28 22:49:30 He also ran on "we should have just taken the oil" and accelerated cruelty and disregard for civilian casualties in fighting terrorism. Like I said it's hard to characterize
504 2018-06-28 22:49:29 The Minnesota PUC has adjourned after approving certificate of need for #Line3 oil pipeline and Enbridge Energy's preferred route, with some modifications. Huge defeat for environmental groups and tribes, though they can challenge decision in court.
505 2018-06-28 22:49:20 @SC_fans_ watching reruns of southern charm and that winning @ClementsLandon was still on so glad she isn't on this season she sounds like a squeaky door that needs oil
506 2018-06-28 22:49:08 The Minnesota PUC’s approval of @Enbridge #Line3 is a giant leap forward. Not only does this project mean the safer and more efficient transport of crude oil across our state, it will also sustain hundreds of jobs and provide a massive boost to the region’s economy.
507 2018-06-28 22:49:08 みんながそうやって炒められて揚げられて…ねぇ、誰のおかげ?誰のおかげかな?

＼It's OIL!!!／
508 2018-06-28 22:49:00 If news correct we will see an interest rate hike! “The Canadian dollar strengthened against its U.S. counterpart on Thursday, bolstered by a 3-1/2-year high for oil prices and as investors added to bets for a Bank of Canada interest rate hike next month.”
509 2018-06-28 22:48:55 How come a loaded trailer was entering Lagos? Is a loaded tanker not meant to be moving out of Lagos? Is it likely that the tanker was from oil hunkering operation? Just thinking load. RIP to the dead.
510 2018-06-28 22:48:47 Oil is big. No other energy source comes close. When you fly to Aberdeen or Ibiza it is not courtesy of solar power.

Let's have an intelligent debate about energy for our children.
511 2018-06-28 22:48:38 Peppermint oil in a hot bath in the dark. Don’t drown.
512 2018-06-28 22:48:38 ill admit near oil refineries or anything that can explode is probably worse case but its always a bad area to have a wildfire is all im saying
513 2018-06-28 22:48:19 My ma got a blue bottle in the chemist and it’s an oil, no sticky feeling after it and it’s waterproof, I’ll send u a piccy of it x
514 2018-06-28 22:48:13 Awwww you’re doing it again ..... when you’re rich and famous, and have your own hair salons in London,Paris... and of course Belfast, remember that oil doll of a classroom assistant... and cut my hair for free! Hahahahaha x
515 2018-06-28 22:48:12 Yeah, grab what’s on sale, bake with oil at 375 bout 25 min, then mix with some green beans and peas... BOOM  dog food.
516 2018-06-28 22:47:57 Tf is this world coming to? I just saw a snap story of girls spraying themselves with cooking oil to try to get a tan.... like what is going on
517 2018-06-28 22:47:52 Scotland is allocated its GEOGRAPHICAL share of oil revenues not a population share. The Scottish Governments own website confirms this. So why are you producing such misleading dishonest figures?
518 2018-06-28 22:47:45 So e dey pain like this????
519 2018-06-28 22:47:29 Knowing you get paid the next day is dangerous. I’m about to go into Target to ONLY get olive oil and a brush so let’s see what the store tells me I need once I go in 
520 2018-06-28 22:47:26 Seasoning WRAPS @stouffers ?! How’s this smeared on paper Italian flavor?  Palm Oil with Sunflower Lecithin, High Oleic Sunflower Oil, Spices, Inulin, Chicory Powder, Pea Fiber, Hydrolyzed Wheat Gluten  (Fractionated Palm Oil, Dextrose, Sugar), Cornstarch

527 2018-06-28 22:46:41 You would think a country that is the 4th lrgst. producer & 3rd lrgst. exporter of oil in the world would be a magnet for resource investment 
-Unfortunately, a mess of reg.'s & a certain prov. that 'kind of' respects the rule of law have charted a new course us
#bcpoli #cdnpoli
528 2018-06-28 22:46:40 Can you ask @PM_AbiyAhmed how is he going to export Ogaden oil. What makes him so confident that he can do something that Mengistu and his mentor Meles Zenawi couldn’t do it?

532 2018-06-28 22:46:21 Like mine that's had the motor seized from oil loss and still runs better than a new Harley
533 2018-06-28 22:46:13 Line 3 approval by Minnesota PUC in preferred route is a bullish catalyst for Canadian heavy oil producers.

536 2018-06-28 22:45:45 Does anyone else constantly rub/touch their face after using the @SolanaLuxe Garden Fairy Oil? It makes my face feel so nice I just can’t stop

538 2018-06-28 22:45:30 i just cut 200 shrimp and got burned by the oil smd i’m the best chef in the world
539 2018-06-28 22:45:29 i've tried a bunch of stuff. atm i've been using a lotion with lactic and salicylic acid in it, but i've used regular lotion, coconut oil (again), prescription eczema cream which is usually good for relieving itches but isn't that great for relieving itchiness from shaving
540 2018-06-28 22:45:29 You’ll be needing that military when the US finds out that there’s oil in the North Sea
541 2018-06-28 22:45:17 One cannot do without tea and cookies! Like the sun and the moon! Water and oil!
542 2018-06-28 22:45:03 And now, not even she is an impediment.
543 2018-06-28 22:45:00 Lmao if you keep walking and your thighs keep rubbing together, you'll know exactly why I mentioned coconut oil. That shit is worse than carpet burn
544 2018-06-28 22:44:58 Does anyone else get super stressed when they get an oil change or is it just me
545 2018-06-28 22:44:50 bfksjfomg i was referencing that disney channel video BUT I really DO love zucchini!!!!! my mom ysed to make this zucchini noodle soup it was like a light soup with lots of other veggies in it too and sesame oil but zucchini as the main flavor and its so good i miss her(soup)

547 2018-06-28 22:44:36 Baby oil will help
548 2018-06-28 22:44:31 This is how every country would've acted. Boosting south sudan oil production increases south sudan revenue as well. Win win situation.
549 2018-06-28 22:44:26 I would either leave the planet on an intergalactic space cruiser of some kind or purchase a old, disused oil platform and declare it my very own independent nation.
550 2018-06-28 22:44:25 i’ll pay someone to pick up my car and take it to get an oil change bc i don’t want to leave my house

552 2018-06-28 22:44:17 What have you been using so far? Cooking oil?! 
553 2018-06-28 22:44:15 I used to be able to grow stubble then I tried my friends beard oil when he left it at my house for like 3 days and then I became the beard friend.
554 2018-06-28 22:44:15 Oil is not our curse. Saudi Arabia,Russia etc used oil revenue to develop. Why not Nigeria ? We don't even produce in one week 1/4 of what they produce in a day !
555 2018-06-28 22:44:12 Yes because oil =Dollar.  Money is why we won't stop drilling the earth until she's sucked dry.  Money money money..  I don't understand why the same companies drilling all the oil won't just switch to monopolizing alternative energy but they don't.

564 2018-06-28 22:43:01 @bbcquestiontime You can’t buy cheaper products if you have no jobs anymore. Lowering tarifs will decimate our native industries, you snake oil charlatans.
565 2018-06-28 22:42:45 Anybody who would benefit from CBD oil for health reasons (despite her husband having a hand in that pot)
566 2018-06-28 22:42:39 If a car engine is bad, it doesn't really matter how many times you change the oil, its not going to run properly.. Its the same with Nigeria. We can replace the president with someone else, but if we don't fix the system, its only going to be more of the same.
567 2018-06-28 22:42:24 WHY DO I HAVE LIKE 5 BOXES OF OIL PASTELS i dont even like oil pastels

current account deficit will rise and with a weakening rupee this is a hit to the economy. Should we be 'Trump'ed into this? @narendramodi

*Iran import of rice from India stands at 1 million tons at ~1200$/ton

593 2018-06-28 22:39:12 trump’s intentions as always is $’s and the only way to collect is to remove sanctions from Russia so trump gets his 19% of the big OIL deal that OPEC signed on to fix production & trump IRAN nuke sanction help fix the market for the investors removing Iran oil market volume !?!
594 2018-06-28 22:39:10 #Suffering is like a sticking wheel; #wisdom is like oil. But what of #Evil, should not an evil wheel stick? No, for the wise let evil inside come and go; without attaching the wheel keeps turning. The unwise tho attach, fear and even act on evil; the cart goes toward the ditch.
595 2018-06-28 22:39:07 It’s snake oil. Reduce cost of feature film by 5/6? The ledger is not the problem or the solution. And this approach takes energy and investment from other approaches.
596 2018-06-28 22:38:54 TY!(I'm almost done w/that 1 hehe)
Oil by far! Tho I trained myself on acrylic 2yrs ago, & still use it from time to time...

597 2018-06-28 22:38:35 You and your cronies in the oil and gas business. You all have bloods in your hands with your dirty business. So shameful
598 2018-06-28 22:38:29 take on Trump for what? Sending his people back to him?
Is Mexico worried about the highest source of income they have, more than oil...the remitances in US dollars?
599 2018-06-28 22:38:29 Hello.... we are showing a trade deficit with the USA mainly because of all of the oil/ gas imported by eastern Canada from them. Here’s a radical idea, why doesn’t the east buy oil from its own country?
600 2018-06-28 22:38:25 Take care of your water oil and air pressure don’t forget to eat .
601 2018-06-28 22:38:25 .@Jim_Jordan You are a bloody disgrace.  Why are you viciously trying to protect that corrupt snake oil salesman in the W.H.    YOU SHOULD PROTECT  YOUR  COUNTRY.

625 2018-06-28 22:34:27 Staples of my daughter's ketogenic diet circa 1992: White toast, mayonnaise, iceberg lettuce, bacon and corn oil. We ate along side her and no even told us about low-carb-flu. She lives with my Ex now and still suffers from epilepsy. They don't want to hear my ideas about keto.
626 2018-06-28 22:34:13 YES he has such intentions !
That's because that oil goes through the north and sudan will benefit financially from any increase in south sudanese oil transported through sudanese lands & exported via port sudan
627 2018-06-28 22:34:10 Super flattering.
628 2018-06-28 22:33:46 I do a Jojoba oil and tea tree oil mixture (4:1 ratio respectively), the jojoba moisturizes and the tea tree cleanses my pores and gets rid of razor bumps and makes it feel cool and minty. Tea tree oil is relatively drying imo and is dangerous to use alone bc it can cause burns
629 2018-06-28 22:33:42 Why did I give this oil man my number for black soap and now he calling me like wtf we not rey have no causal conversation
630 2018-06-28 22:33:31 Damn I’m sick of getting oil changes . They doing everything except coming up with a car that don’t need oil 
631 2018-06-28 22:33:21 Please tell me what he’s winning? Trade war, oil prices...
632 2018-06-28 22:33:17 Is Ethiopia ready for the curse oil brings along? Do we've strong roadmap to how locals & ET benefit? Couldn't it be a way to be screwed up?
633 2018-06-28 22:33:13 Look at that snake oil salesman!
634 2018-06-28 22:32:58 That picture looks like oil piping, if so oil prices are up way up 72.00 barrel, so steel pipe prices need to adjust to match, if tariff is the prime issue, just a thought here.
635 2018-06-28 22:32:55 Great if you like coconut! I’m allergic to Coconut  and coconut oilx
636 2018-06-28 22:32:50 Do you mean “What trends are the #oil & #gas sector facing this month?”
637 2018-06-28 22:32:49 American banks hiking their dividends like this is like Canadian oil companies becoming income trusts. The top is in!
638 2018-06-28 22:32:43 I went on amazon to buy coconut oil and I bought 4 things and none of them were coconut oil. I already spent too much money and now I’m not gonna get coconut oil. Fml.
639 2018-06-28 22:32:36 Stealing all the toilets because there's oil in the name to own the libs
640 2018-06-28 22:32:30 Even more of a reason to hold USDs when the oil runs out: many of the world's most desirable assets are priced in USD - US real estate, private sector equity, and US Treasuries.
641 2018-06-28 22:32:13 They keep assuming we are poor just because Someone is a barrow pusher. That barrow pusher can earn more than 100k in a month. Indices for poverty is so restricted. What works for Europe might not work for Africa.
642 2018-06-28 22:32:01 1st of all, why would the parties have a deal that includes #Sudan in its wording? The conflict is internal, the issues and clear. Unless of course Bashir has an interest to protect, Our #SouthSudan Oil.

646 2018-06-28 22:31:24 Amham Claudia, e o homicídio só existe porque existem leis proibindo de matar, senta lá. As leis antitruste foram criadas para impedir empresas como a Standard Oil (Rockefellers) de utilizar métodos escusos para sufocar a competição e criar monopólios (trusts) ilegais.
647 2018-06-28 22:31:16 bet you had oil on aswell

654 2018-06-28 22:30:37 Good to see an Oil Major adapting to new paradigm. Helps the public have confidence in Electric Vehicles and that they can get around the country more easily via charging at petrol stations.

660 2018-06-28 22:30:01 If only the governments throughout our history have invested the money we accumulated from oil revenues alone, on infrastructure such as railways. We wouldn’t be experiencing such unfortunate accidents on roads. Petroleum products would be transported using rail. #PrayforNigeria
661 2018-06-28 22:29:47 Is it tongue-numbing? If it doesn’t contain Szechuan peppercorns or at least peppercorn oil, it’s not Szechuan.

665 2018-06-28 22:29:24 Yes they do I put three drops of CBD oil in my dogs gal water bowl twice a week because I have a dog that suffers from old age. Bad joints. I've tryed those dog supplement's she only eat them once I a while but she drinks the water and it really seems 2 help.
666 2018-06-28 22:29:08 Is it just me or is it an insult beyond belief that @CNN's Twitter banner says, "Facts First." Ha ha ha. Facts? Ha ha ha. That's water saying, "Oil first."
667 2018-06-28 22:28:54 As a Stokie exiled to West London I can confirm that: 1. U. Stoke a breakfast without oatcakes is an abomination 2. Beans on a full English is also an abomination. Please respect our traditions and do not be deduced by this snake oil

668 2018-06-28 22:28:51 Where can I find quality marijuana vape oil?
669 2018-06-28 22:28:49 Lol Chavez didn't decrease oil production on purpose. That was his bank!! It was his incompetence that destroyed the industry when he decided to fire all the workers and replace them with his loyal marxist servants who knew nothing about the industry.
670 2018-06-28 22:28:34 I already plumped for leaves bestrewn upon the steaks with some olive oil and garlic paste, but noted for future reference. The rosemary bush is waist-high, so I'm not gonna be running short.
671 2018-06-28 22:28:21 There is 2 727 aircraft based in doncaster for oil spills that can easily be filled with water. Be there within minutes.
672 2018-06-28 22:28:12 Ironically, the oil industry in Venezuela was nationalized by Carlos Andres Perez, the very leader Chavez later tried to overthrow in two coup attempts supported by Communist Cuba in 1992.

675 2018-06-28 22:27:56 so again where did i defend it? you're literally admitting to me right now that i'm arguing in defense of decreasing oil production.
676 2018-06-28 22:27:56 but responsible me is telling me to go get my oil changed first lol
677 2018-06-28 22:27:56 I kind of knew that, I was just being lazy about Googling it to be sure.

And as you say, a very good contrast with the country that protected its oil wealth carefully; Norway.
678 2018-06-28 22:27:49 Oil for Food...
679 2018-06-28 22:27:25 It’s not the fact that people are selling their votes, it’s the fact that someone can be so poor that they are willing to do anything for a bottle of groundnut oil. it’s easy to say don’t sell your vote when you know where your next meal is coming from
680 2018-06-28 22:27:05 Find a blue or dark grey color, find a chalk or oil like brush, and use that on a lower opacity or darken setting  also SICKKKKK
681 2018-06-28 22:27:03 Sunflower oil is a disgrace.
682 2018-06-28 22:26:41 Why do you allow persons who are extremely dirty from a working site to use the train... I mean they leave the seats full of cement and oil . No offence jobs, but shouldn’t you the Tfl have a logical policy for a clean trousers and shirt before entering the Train station ?
683 2018-06-28 22:26:41 Parts for what? It has no transmission, no pistons, no oil.
684 2018-06-28 22:26:30 Canada seems to be getting involved also and Columbia..it certainly appears they are going to start an oil war all in the name of fkn democracy..the con has already started..that being that the US cares..while it’s killing..

688 2018-06-28 22:25:43 Because the US isn't afraid of terrorists and being blackmailed by Arab oil countries.
689 2018-06-28 22:25:32 I honestly don't remember.  I typically only pull out the oil to remove liquid lipsticks.
690 2018-06-28 22:25:24 There's a war going on in my stomach area since yesterday x,x
At first I thought it was only period cramps but I'm starting to wonder if the bit of fish oil I ate by accident on tuesday is the culprit too.
(i hadn't eaten fish things for a year already, I'm almost full vegan now)

694 2018-06-28 22:24:49 Sounds delish! RT @AndyMfit: @SmashFit l do mine with sweet potato. Top with cinnamon and coconut oil. So good...
695 2018-06-28 22:24:45 You said it was justifiable to use a major resource (oil) to develop your economy (as in Chavez and the Venezuelan economy) but oil is also responsible for the ecological destruction of the planet... How is that not absolutely contradictory?
696 2018-06-28 22:24:45 Oga pack well..  Spend Lagos taxes on sir otedola bridge.. Correct the sharp slop from mobile filling station inward capital oil. Save a life. No body knows tomorrow. Fire no get second chance.  Use ur office and award a contract to correct the mess..  Cure d dead trap.

698 2018-06-28 22:23:43 PPS: "gunslingers, whores and snake oil salesmen" .... lol. At my most cynical, I might agree this is a perfect, bi-partisan description of large numbers of politicos. Truly not sure how to fix it given the money, attention, power in play. Devolution maybe.
699 2018-06-28 22:23:28 Take over America, a la Game of Thrones: 1) stock the moat (20  years of gun proliferation); 2) raise the drawbridge (make upward mobility virtually impossible via unfair and unaffordable tax cuts); 3) pour boiling oil on anyone who'd try to breach the ramparts (pack the courts).
700 2018-06-28 22:23:28 Anyone know cheap place to get oil changed ??
701 2018-06-28 22:23:20 hopefully the Indy Star will install armed security if they don't already have it.  I feel safer at Bankers Life and Lucas oil knowing there is police presence.
702 2018-06-28 22:23:06 Hi Linda have a look at Live better with cancer for some ideas. Personally I lost ability to read but puzzles, colouring books, mags useful for chemo sessions. Aveeno shower and cream for during treatment. Fluffy socks, sweets, nail oil. Feel free to DM me if you want xx
703 2018-06-28 22:23:03 God told us to give to the needy so if the so called men of God are so righteous why do they sell holy water, anointing oil to you and not give the money to the poor, build small, small apartments, health centres or schools  for the poorest in the society?
704 2018-06-28 22:22:56 All new oil discoveries are associated with emargence of dectatoriship, not war.... war comes later in the cycle
705 2018-06-28 22:22:33 It really is because I've done some reading & I came across this from CNN Africa 'Oil tanker accidents are common in Nigeria. Last October, 20 cars and four commercial motorcycles were burned when a tanker spilled petroleum on a busy road' lessons should've been learnt 
706 2018-06-28 22:22:15 @BomgaarsSupply do you folks not give military discounts on power tools and oil products?

C. Will You use the olive oil or vegetable oil
708 2018-06-28 22:21:47 ironic that the people in a state that is famous for its massive superhighways constantly clogged with cars sued the oil companies for driving climate change. seems like californians are doing a great job of driving it as well. do they now plan to sue themselves?
709 2018-06-28 22:21:46 RSI is that of XLE/OIL ratio. Very oversold and you see what happens each time we get this signal... Means energy stocks dont believe this OIL short squeeze

"This is a very significant event for the company and  the Weald basin. Importantly, tests so far show oil has flowed to the surface under its own pressure and has not, so far, required artificial lift.
712 2018-06-28 22:21:35 Something that u don't get it or don't understand the reality of today. 
The entire system of KDP or PUK or YPG run by US n Zionist,  doesn't matter what you do,  think or hope, must be always Zionist interest and approvals. Rember Iraq n kirkuk (oil)belong to the jew not u.
713 2018-06-28 22:20:59 If you want to be technical, oil is solar energy too, absorbed by plants a million years ago, eaten by animals, then stored in the earth. Is there even a single electron on the planet was wasn't once solar energy?
714 2018-06-28 22:20:48 あい
715 2018-06-28 22:20:47 GOP for umpteen years, articulate, but lacks vision. $600+ bil army to protect oil stocks. Post HS ed kept out of reach to supply under educated youth enlistees -2 free years of post high school education plus universal early childhood education
716 2018-06-28 22:20:41 Fixin for oil war with the US are we? Grrrrrross!!!i see what y’all are doing..
717 2018-06-28 22:20:40 Just the epicenter of drugs , terrorism , the Chinese taking the gold and the Russians the oil ..
718 2018-06-28 22:20:39 Thank you SO MUCH for mentioning that oil. I've literally just bought it from @feelunique My skin is in bits so I am hoping it helps. There is a 3 for 2 on @BiodermaLabUK too so could be worth it for anyone else looking to try it.Also if you pay in Sterling it works out cheaper x

721 2018-06-28 22:20:19 Maybe cause none of us follow Milo or have any idea of what he says?
722 2018-06-28 22:20:12 Is it me or are the ads all but filling up my @facebook timeline for mostly snake oil. Slimming T-Shirts, Miracle diets etc. If @Facebook insist on recouping the losses from no longer being able to flog our data by advertising, at least make it for credible products.
723 2018-06-28 22:19:49 Most time passing thru the rd that lead to my area I always fear for the lives of people that go through this rd daily its so bad that containers fall so often, oven this night a container has already faling, the last time a tanker fell thank God it was black oil,atan agbara road
724 2018-06-28 22:19:39 @ImranKhanPTI what on earth were you thinking of when you prostrate before a pir's grave? You have blown your votes for that stupidity

727 2018-06-28 22:19:10 I understand but the government will still take the blame cos they know We aren’t meant to transport over 70% of our crude oil by road. Poor country with bad leaders in government

733 2018-06-28 22:18:19 Rippling waves of pain split my legs open as my constitution ruptures. A head breaks forth from within, and red oil spills to the hot concrete. I smear the blood with my hands. 
Namaste, bitch.
734 2018-06-28 22:18:16 Oil is about to drop 20% Peter...THEN it will continue on higher....but that is weeks away.
735 2018-06-28 22:18:13 Yea i use wild growth and mango lime oil, that helps a lot.
736 2018-06-28 22:18:09 おはようございます。苦肉の策としてまた吹き飛ばすしか…
737 2018-06-28 22:18:08 Yes. Coconut oil will clog your pores and then literally go bad inside your skin. It’s not really even a moisturizer, it’s a sealant. Good oils for the face are jojoba oil, grape seed oil, sweet almond oil, marula oil, and I have a cleanser that has sunflower seed oil as well
738 2018-06-28 22:18:07 Mate, I've married Abigail, Leah and Elliott and have a huge truffle oil business but now I just hate my grandad for taking me out to the boring, shit filled countryside. At least my fingers still stank good :)
739 2018-06-28 22:18:06 i need a oil treatment then boom this appt for some braids
740 2018-06-28 22:18:01 Yesterday I treated myself to a Hapuka steak. I cooked in garlic infused oil. Home made oven fries. I love kai moana. Could eat seafood every night. ( if I could afford to)
741 2018-06-28 22:18:00 Please look into this..I’m shaking I’m so pissed..I knew this would happen..they are of course obviously after their oil!!!
742 2018-06-28 22:17:53 Never miss an oil change or you gon run into 40 issues
743 2018-06-28 22:17:47 Take some teaspoon of honey and Lucile oil to subside your venomous bile and wrath
744 2018-06-28 22:17:36 Do you brush and comb your beard? Do you use beard oil?

These things may prevent the itchiness the you've experienced before.
745 2018-06-28 22:17:33 RIGHT?!?! She probably did an oil change on the tractor before she left and still smells it!
746 2018-06-28 22:17:24 This isn’t surprising. It’s oil,$$$$ B4 humans, environment! #StopLine3 #SaveOurLand #SaveOurWater

752 2018-06-28 22:16:38 The problem with Hemp is big oil doesn't have a monopoly on it.
753 2018-06-28 22:16:37 Hello Ma, I only use organic coconut oil, I think it's ok!
754 2018-06-28 22:16:33 Nobody ever mentions weather ... that was my number one reason for moving .... great city and memories.. miss going to all the oil games

758 2018-06-28 22:15:50 @TYTPolitics @TYTNetwork @cenkuygur @AnaKasparian @johniadarola I seriously believe Trumpleforeskinz is after the oil in Venezuela being the worlds largest and pretending to care about the people while they are currently torturing South Americans and their kids..I knew they would
759 2018-06-28 22:15:35 Who’s the bald guy on the panel talking shit? About as environmentally aware as your average (snake) oil salesman #bbcqt
760 2018-06-28 22:15:30 this came up at arch lobby think-in too; the highway program was subsidy to private interests thus also public investment in corporate political power - ie. wars over oil were not planned by drivers, but funded by them, vis a vis planning decisions made in postwar period.
761 2018-06-28 22:15:25 They grew up going to Germany and USSR with their father building oil refineries for Hitler and Stalin. I think it's just about making money, and thinking they're better than everyone else.
762 2018-06-28 22:15:24 Coconut oil... sounds ridiculous but after using it for a week your skin will stop producing so much oil because it doesn’t need to!
763 2018-06-28 22:15:10 Yes, Chavez was so incompetent that he even ended up destroying the oil industry, further exacerbating the already rampant poverty caused by his marxist policies.
764 2018-06-28 22:14:52 The day I’m trying to get my oil changed the power goes out lmao
765 2018-06-28 22:14:47 Hope oil! Hahaj
766 2018-06-28 22:14:46 @Jenna_Marbles how do you get the glue out of your eyebrows? Do you use oil?
767 2018-06-28 22:14:32 Too much capital invested in oil - had to make a profit on that first - but the wheel has started to turn now...finally
768 2018-06-28 22:14:07 Was it Forte Oil vehicle?
769 2018-06-28 22:14:02 Let's not forget. This was Nigeria before we found oil.
770 2018-06-28 22:13:59 More fun, so make it like baseball lite? Maybe basketball? 

Maybe sinkholes, exploding baseballs and oil slick cleats?

Do we need to add skinny jeans, maybe some kale chips and hand crafted ipa’s?

775 2018-06-28 22:13:37 Imo, too many pieces in this puzzle for albashir to be able to pull this off
I don't know how the agreement intends to secure the oil wells but according to what's published in Sudanese media, Sudan role is to help with the maintainance of damaged wells & the same fees as before
776 2018-06-28 22:13:20 Is that even a thing?
777 2018-06-28 22:13:08 Your insight is on the mark! Correlates with constant bullish August calls bought in the oil sector including CHK.. please share any trade you get into!
778 2018-06-28 22:12:41 LOL i hear ya on that. Was it difficult even with oil?
779 2018-06-28 22:12:31 That's exactly it @Eva, & according to the recently signed #Khartoum agreement #Sudan will be working with #SouthSudan on Oil production & Security at the oil fields.@SalSly you should have a look at it.
780 2018-06-28 22:11:55 I guess to be fair Green is pretty good, but they'll never win and i'm not convinced they've fully thought out some climate change issues. We really need a plan to phase out our oil, can't be immediate, can't be expanded further. We could keep it for plastic though, not burning
781 2018-06-28 22:11:53 i got weed in my coconut oil :(
782 2018-06-28 22:11:47 @jimmy_dore I’m seriously thinking that Trumpleforeskinz is now going for Venezuela’s oil reserves that are the largest in the world..and they’re pretending they care about the people when we’ve seen how they care about our South American neighbors..They are after oil I know it..
783 2018-06-28 22:11:38 whale oil I assume?
784 2018-06-28 22:11:30 But I learned most of my distrust of blow-hards and snake oil salesmen from my parents, who visibly reacted to and pointed out braggadocio, forced rapport building, etc.
785 2018-06-28 22:11:07 No, criticism is the oil of a Democracies Engine.
786 2018-06-28 22:11:07 We painted a wall of the vet clinic with high oil primer and I’m pretty sure I’m high for the first time 
787 2018-06-28 22:11:01 I finally got an oil change in my car and I feel like I have my life together 
788 2018-06-28 22:10:26 I think trump knows why Putin needs Crimea, for the PL to move oil from the Kara Sea. Sanctions were put in place b4 Exxon could fully explore the area. There are trillions of barrels of oil waiting to moved. I bet after their summit,trump will lift oil sanctions so he can profit
789 2018-06-28 22:10:26 zit advice is good advice. after a certain point, you want to pop + drain it, but do so w/ rubbing alcohol. i use a coconut oil/aloe lotion instead of chamois cream when i have to ride with them. oh, avoid riding if u can :/

792 2018-06-28 22:10:04 I think baby oil should be more expensive. I mean, how many babies do they have to process to get that much product? And how little do we value our babies?
793 2018-06-28 22:09:48 Lip Therapy from DisChem or Soft Lips they have it at Clicks. Labello also. Scrubbing your lips with a coconut oil and sugar scrub also really helps
794 2018-06-28 22:09:44 I think I’ve learnt a lesson today ... not to put carrot oil on my ginger skin 
795 2018-06-28 22:09:38 According to YOU, the oil industry is responsible for "ecological disaster around the planet" but now you defend it because it was useful to the marxist agenda? Not hypocritical at all..
796 2018-06-28 22:09:34 What does " a little scotch in oil" mean?
797 2018-06-28 22:09:31 SNAPSHOT | Oil climbed higher in the NY morning, up about 0.7%. US equities found some support, while Europe played catch-up to the afternoon sell-off the day before. Emerging market currencies remained under pressure. @ANZ_Research $CL_F $SPX $USDCNH -- #OOTT #Stocks #FX

803 2018-06-28 22:08:40 Unfortunately no catalyst for it to go up though. Oversupply looming in market, oil and gas majors constantly looking to leave and even if the NDP are out, this reversal seems to be slow or nonexistent right now. Old boys club in Calgary needs to rethink how business is done.
804 2018-06-28 22:08:38 This is a turbo dog in front of a Turbo car! Mylo is a BEAUTIFUL Italian Greyhound who stopped by for an oil change, but had to take a moment to check out this sweet Kia Optima (which is $6k off!)

808 2018-06-28 22:08:22 Chiarelli did fine. As was stated injuries and illness were the major factors last year. Other teams who are continuously against the cap make it work. You want cap space?? It is easy. Dump mcdavid, Drai and RNH. Bam. Now you have cap space. Oil are now forced to develop.
809 2018-06-28 22:08:21 I just have one question and it’s a very honest one and it’s been bothering me since.

Why always that place close to that capital oil filling station?? every major accident on that Lagos-Ibadan expressway recently has occurred right beside it or a bit behind or ahead of it.
810 2018-06-28 22:08:19 You mean a better, more efficient way to grease the palms of their oily corporate comrades and their @NRA pals
No need to lie about Zinke’s intent. He never saw wild lands he didn’t like better with an oil rig, or wildlife that he didn’t prefer dead on his unliving room wall.
811 2018-06-28 22:08:13 The Howard government was a foreign interferer in East Timor when we were negotiating the oil Treaty. Now we're enacting legislation in Canberra to stop other foreign powers ie China from doing the same thing to us.
812 2018-06-28 22:08:08 The decomposition point of Olive Oil is 220 degrees Celsius
813 2018-06-28 22:07:54 Well a bag of rice cartoon of oil and all they give won’t reduce the hunger and poverty we all going through
814 2018-06-28 22:07:45 These guys must soak themselves in oil baths overnight before testifying, and gargle with oil just before entering the hearing rooms.

816 2018-06-28 22:07:31 hey, I can live with the baby oil teases but you right... we don’t need a Nick Jonas queer bait from the WWE.
817 2018-06-28 22:07:21 Her Moroccan oil and heat it up, comb it through your hair for like a 30 mins then leave it in over night. I did this last month and my hair grew 2 inches.

820 2018-06-28 22:07:06 Yes sir, it’s hard being a lifelong Albertan watching what has happened to the province. Oil and gas aside - the province is in need of a drastic change and I can’t see the good people of AB voting orange or red going forward. With that said blue isn’t perfect either lol.
821 2018-06-28 22:06:28 México imports 75% of gas and diesel. Its an oil Producer. Have no alternative in transportation. Also he Will build modern trains...
And AMLO is younger than Trump.

827 2018-06-28 22:05:32 Coconut oil and/or fish oil and a Zoom Groom brush!!
828 2018-06-28 22:05:22 Not sure what place you're referring to... but Venezuelan socialists nationalized the oil industry in 1976 and our economy has depended exclusively on it ever since, so marxists are responsible for "global ecological disaster." Also, neoliberalism never existed in Latin America.
829 2018-06-28 22:05:22 What kind of fool only wears a tanning oil with no spf in it.. at a beach in this weather? Oh ya... ME
830 2018-06-28 22:05:05 Was going to stream right now but I'm gonna take my lil sister to get her car's oil changed . I'll be a bit late today.

おはよーーーwww
832 2018-06-28 22:04:45 @realDonaldTrump so, according to your promise, you must completely ban Iran's oil. The United States can do this, the other way is time-wasting, and it has nothing to do. Iran's oil should be cut off 100%
833 2018-06-28 22:04:43 De Bruyne been on the carrot oil!?? Dangerous stuff
834 2018-06-28 22:04:43 The US needs to become a modern state. Shake off the mythology of the past. The time is past for gunslingers, whores and snake oil salesmen. The US needs competent administrators and the incorporation of equality into its priorities. No more war and no more oil.
835 2018-06-28 22:04:35 Sooooo i spent the whole day worrying about my car, find out all the bih needed was an oil change
836 2018-06-28 22:04:27 Yinmu. Nigeria that have Herdsmen oil.
837 2018-06-28 22:04:27 If we get a new provincial and federal govt 8n place... maybe they do not hamstring the oil companies in Alberta as much.  Then investment will come back to a degree.  Alberta has just been kicked in the teeth provincially and federally the last # of years.  Yeesh.
838 2018-06-28 22:04:21 @realDonaldTrump Why should the US allow the Iranian regime to take part in its oil revenues, to kill innocent people or produce nuclear weapons? President Trump You have said many times that I do not pay money to Iran,
839 2018-06-28 22:04:08 That broccoli is history! Garlic and olive oil got me thru.
840 2018-06-28 22:03:54 A fire broke out in @Bathbodyworks17 today because of @Trampico booty knocking over the oil. No casualties were recorded. #weloveasale #bigbooty #itsatragicthalyfe
841 2018-06-28 22:03:48 For years I’ve never understood why one of the big oil firms hasn’t put their vast profits into battery tech. Imagine what 20 years research and billions of dollars could have produced. And they would now be primed to own the future.
842 2018-06-28 22:03:32 KAI always cooks really spicy curry with a lot of chili oil to it... It BURNS!;;
843 2018-06-28 22:03:30 I love essential oils & oil diffusers 
844 2018-06-28 22:03:25 The cast iron skillet & hot oil
845 2018-06-28 22:03:20 @realDonaldTrump There is never any case exemption; you must complete the boycott, otherwise it will not matter. I would like to make it clear that only a full oil boycott will affect Iran's regime and the other option is not worth it.
846 2018-06-28 22:03:18 I cannot see such a system becoming widespread without displacing a substantial portion of USD-denominated trade (particularly in oil). If global USD use merely ceases to continually rise, let alone drops, a reset is the only possible consequence. USD hegemony must expand or die.
847 2018-06-28 22:03:17 if i ever make a youtube channel ima go on there and show y’all something useful like how to change your fucking oil or where the oil even goes cause some of y’all need that more than how to do a smokey eye lmfao
848 2018-06-28 22:03:03 The body shop youth oil. I put that shit on twice a day and you glow
849 2018-06-28 22:02:52 I don’t know what life was like before @josi_figueroa mom’s chili oil. I swear I put it on everything. It’s magic.

855 2018-06-28 22:02:18 Tanker carrying oil, fell, exploded and got all those cars burnt on a bridge Along Lagos-Ibadan Express way.
Loads of casualties.

860 2018-06-28 22:01:15 Shouldn’t you be selling oil to those who already have some?
861 2018-06-28 22:01:07 I keep it done i only rock the grow for about a week to let it breath like I’m about to get some braids tomorrow. I just need to oil it more i guess
862 2018-06-28 22:01:03 It really is nice to know someone. I just got an oil change, car wash, air in my tires and full evaluation of my car for $26 #PraiseGod

865 2018-06-28 22:00:28 Well, you may have a point. I mean the number of oil tankers parking by the roadside is an eye-sore. Still accidents do happen, and no society is above that. Na God get life.

869 2018-06-28 21:59:52 Can u provide any sources for this ? That sudan controls South sudan oil production for an undisclosed period ?
870 2018-06-28 21:59:50 That’s what happens when you threaten to sell oil in Euros instead of USD.... you get targeted
871 2018-06-28 21:59:46 Peer reviewed research show that a very high percentage of oil wells leak:
• 5% wells leak immediately;
• 50% leak at 15-20 years; and
• 60% leak at 30 years

877 2018-06-28 21:59:22 Of course what to do now is to pray, no actions will be taken, no oil firm will be sued, this too will  pass because "it's a phase" and then we will all go back to our normal lives and then it will happen again and we'd repeat the process as usual.
Omashe o!

880 2018-06-28 21:58:49 Other then a sunbed I’ve never burned in my life and now that my neck and shoulders are scaulded I can’t even sleep , regretting all the baby oil now
881 2018-06-28 21:58:46 No be small thing,I nearly gave up,but when I look at where I started from,and my parents struggle plus the leg ace and pace I'll set fr my younger ones, I just had to push and forge ahead .
882 2018-06-28 21:58:44 The crude spreads and cracks have come in so fast that retail gas prices are actually lower now than they were in May despite oil's large rally. Maybe the consumer will be stronger than expected?
883 2018-06-28 21:58:33 Crude Oil  has had a phenomenal year. Since rising out of the base 12 months ago  it is up nearly 70%. But it was also up nearly 70% back in the middle of  May. That is when it dropped 10% in 2 weeks, before the recovery to the  current level.
884 2018-06-28 21:58:32 I’m at the mechanic, where they’re checking for the source of an oil leak. Depending on what they find, it will be a cheap or expensive fix. Place your bets.

890 2018-06-28 21:57:52 Funny... All of Latin America's marxist movements since Chavez came to power in 98 were financed by the Venezuelan oil industry
891 2018-06-28 21:57:45 We aren’t meant to transport over 70% of our crude oil by road. Poor country with bad leaders in government 
892 2018-06-28 21:57:45 So this is where you receive first hand reports on how UAE forces are killing Yemenis civilians and blame the Houthis for it to whitewash your oil tyrants hands in it
893 2018-06-28 21:57:40 Gear oil is a no go, though. Trust me on that one.
894 2018-06-28 21:57:32 The fact that @LafargeHolcim was charged today with sponsoring ISIS would be buried in the noise of the 24 hour news cycle. This is a very important development. Big business thrives on human suffering. Big oil has been distabilising the ME for decades now big cement has joined
895 2018-06-28 21:57:22 We need to bypass opec and use our oil.
896 2018-06-28 21:57:09 Hot olive oil splashed on my hand is not a big accident.
897 2018-06-28 21:57:00 Wow… my heart goes out to the family of those who lost their lives earlier today from that oil tanker explosion. #PrayForNigeria May their souls rest in peace.
898 2018-06-28 21:57:00 In this episode of Aladdin, we explore the complex relationship between Jafar and the CIA. How much of Agrabah's future oil output will the young vizier barter for financial backing and a dozen crates of the new, experimental serpent staves? #writingprompt
899 2018-06-28 21:56:52 The US actually exports oil to other countries? I don't get that when we could use it here. It must be contractual?
900 2018-06-28 21:56:50 @mogbolu1 well I ll like for you to also see this senseless tweet from a parody account, this is how people can be easily confused and misguided to think this man and his company is actually affiliated to the oil tanker and the fatal incident.
901 2018-06-28 21:56:43 Don't blame her, happy hour was really great that night!
902 2018-06-28 21:56:37 Yes kinda like that! Except freshly shaved & covered in baby oil so the lasers can shine off of me

908 2018-06-28 21:55:57 You so dumb if you aren’t putting oil in your water
909 2018-06-28 21:55:53 Bro u need to be there fucked up governor, fucked up state , fucked up country there is a law or make fuel tankers go through this route only or move in d mid night but greed and Corruption won't make d law stand because they own d oil well , vessels and filling Station
910 2018-06-28 21:55:47 I hope so, one thing I can say though is I gave money to that bastard snake oil salesman Chris Roberts, and at least Mr Braben has actually made a game so whatever ED may be at least it's not a clusterfuck scam ;)
911 2018-06-28 21:55:46 Yeah. Next stop Nuremberg! War criminal. Go to war with Sadam because George was stealing his oil under the fence in Kuwait. Then that shit about WMD. Really? Then TM the PM start fighting with Russia over that nonsense in Salisbury. What's the matter with these people. On drugs?
912 2018-06-28 21:55:41 Thanks, and I'm a follower and fan of yours! 

But people choose contraceptive methods for personal reasons. And when experts ridicule them for those choices, we drive them into the arms of snake oil salespeople like Daysy. 

We need to clean up our own acts on that front, too.

You can take @WBrettWilson who loves big oil & everything related to resource extraction, money & deregulation  - more than anything else (more than the future of his children's children). A union made in Texas
918 2018-06-28 21:54:54 Why is a combustible substance carrier moving and competing limited roads with regular motorist ?

I don’t care about your crude oil . All I care about is why is life not prioritized over revenue ?

934 2018-06-28 21:52:36 Safe for oil plundering, and spills after being paid lip service that there would be none, and countless other lies.  How many people did you have to lock up, and how many rules did you have to rewrite to make this happen?  CROOK!
935 2018-06-28 21:52:18 girl if you’re using it for a conditioning agent then use Aragon oil! It’s 10x better and your hair actually absorbs it but you don’t need to use a ton of it!

945 2018-06-28 21:51:06 "Oil rally thats exhausted to upside"...That is a completely different question/argument. I was just talking Technicals and possible intraday scenarios. Crude's rally is not over yet imo but it is amazing how #drillers lag .That is related to long-dated crude futures not spot imo
946 2018-06-28 21:50:58 Because the oil companies haven't got it figured out how to profit from Hemp. Greed over weed EVERY time.
947 2018-06-28 21:50:55 So is coconut oil bad for your skin? I sometimes use it to moisturize my face. Which natural oils are best to use as daily moisturiser? I have very dry skin but no acne.

Yeah, I don't think the facts matter to the folks who made that, or they would have started with a section on how the Western diet is a disaster for those people...
952 2018-06-28 21:50:13 Right. I bought that new Chevy and it’s already been in the shop twice. My Honda has 312,000 miles on it and I’ve never had any problems besides a small oil leak smh
953 2018-06-28 21:50:03 The industry ain’t dying bruh. Have you seen the global growth rates for oil? Or the price of oil right now? Surely you drive and know it ain’t cheap
954 2018-06-28 21:49:50 Tbh my mom could put oil sheen on my hair and pull it through a cap and it look just as good as going to get someone to do it. It's just incredibly painful.
955 2018-06-28 21:49:41 Anyone who supported this man is a fool. An entire country fell for a snake oil salesmen. He also acts like he had a mandate when he lost the popular vote.

What would you suggest instead?

972 2018-06-28 21:47:47 Change oil today 
973 2018-06-28 21:47:34 Oil es la qué hay de ahora en adelante
974 2018-06-28 21:47:28 I don't think they'll slow things up deliberately but most of the big oil companies are worse than the civil service when it comes to bureaucracy.  I'm also intrigued as to why Chargemaster sold up. What was the bait or were they concerned the mkt might stall or?
975 2018-06-28 21:46:58 .@chrishansen Good to serve 10 RUBIO 5 Press. Not when Crooked Hillary and happiness! OIL or on Periscope!
976 2018-06-28 21:46:48 Instead of ripping at the carbon tax, why don't you suggest MORE action on #climatechange ? How about we don't make our children pay for our addiction to oil by destroying their future? How about we actually try and prevent human extinction instead of promoting it? No?

990 2018-06-28 21:44:04 Peanut butter everything. And not that cheap stuff. Get the real deal with oil still in it. Bulk you right up @NotGayJared
991 2018-06-28 21:43:55 Wade launched himself down the corridor, openly destroying the fine oil paintings of people's past—holding no shame in the fact he was going to fight Pietro in this mansion.
     Even if Charles will probably kill him.

“I will make you pay for destroying my Cher drawing!”
992 2018-06-28 21:43:55 @followlasg 
We have encountered enough misfortune in Nigeria. It's high time we started doing the right thing. Oil tankers should not moving during daylight & govt should improve the railway system.
993 2018-06-28 21:43:49 Spying for genuine natsec reasons, sure.  Spying to, effectively, minimise a big oil company’s royalty payments ?  That shouldn’t be OK.

997 2018-06-28 21:43:18 Dakota is a  author that likes Olive oil on their anchovies pizza with herbal tea
998 2018-06-28 21:43:10 If the money was spent on renewables instead of a pipeline, we would have 8 times the jobs that oil and gas provide. 4.5 billion (old pipeline) + 12 billion (new pipeline) + 3.3 billion (oil subsidies) would provide HUGE number of jobs and kick-start a green economy.
999 2018-06-28 21:43:00 Better oil that revolving door.
1000 2018-06-28 21:42:53 LOL okay pharaoh only gets steamed sweet potatoes. seasoning and oil is bad for doggos. but ME?? i use a shit ton of butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, and throw that bitch in the oven  it’s BOMB. granny’s recipe lol
1001 2018-06-28 21:42:42 M Smith in The Present wonders why US hasn't wholly switched frm oil to solar power=end of a fossil fuel.Believes cost of 1 1/2-3tr  wld return w profit in 4 yrs.Contends oil cos. wld still profit.Says we r able to replace bldng materials for houses w plastic=less deforestation.

1003 2018-06-28 21:42:08 No Mann island was named after John Mann - oil trader late 1700’s. Tom Mann wasn’t from Liverpool, in fact I think he only spent a year or two in Liverpool.

1008 2018-06-28 21:40:44 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
1009 2018-06-28 21:40:44 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1010 2018-06-28 21:40:32 Sensor was a glitch the guy said all tires are fine. So that's good news :) got my recall wipers replaced and oil change too.

1013 2018-06-28 21:40:12 This is a venture on making little units to get profitable crude materials from oil refining buildups. The units are fabricated based on the protected, remarkable rocket and space innovation. #Papusha #ICO #Crowdsale #Bitcoin

1015 2018-06-28 21:40:00 Plus Oz might have very little choice but to transition, seeing we get all our petrol from Singapore(we no longer refine) when they transition to EV's they will have no reason to refine then. They have good reason to switch to EV's , no oil. small country, tech advanced.
1016 2018-06-28 21:39:48 This is so important for people of Iran who seek #IranRegimeChange, however, if India cut the oil totally and china buy more or other scenario, we, people of Iran will DEFINITELY change the regime. Nowadays, Iranians do count on The USA, Israel and Saudi Arabia help.
1017 2018-06-28 21:39:48 I wasn’t going to try & make my own version of fried rice but... no soy sauce ugh! A little bit of sesame seed oil. It definitely isn’t going to come out right lol. Now what to make...
1018 2018-06-28 21:39:45 You guys are allowing demigod Trump to spew out his facist hatred. Although he is total ignoramus about everything . He knows how to be a Snake Oil Salesman. Forever flipping truth into lies and lies into truth. His followers and enablers have given away their morality for the $$
1019 2018-06-28 21:39:26 Someone embezzled the money for oil pipelines
Someone embezzled the money for cargo trains.
Someone embezzled money for ports in other states apart from Lagos.

Now, a serious avoidable disaster has taken place AGAIN.

But you will still collect N500 and rice next election.
1020 2018-06-28 21:39:15 Oil prices are only one of the factors. Rise in US interest rates is another reason behind fall of rupee.  Interest rates in the US is set to rise further. So it's not a temporary situation, idi..

1026 2018-06-28 21:38:25 Not in connection with the Yuan oil futures contract. People promoting that narrative DROPPED it when it was pointed out that SGE gold cant leave the country

1029 2018-06-28 21:38:13 Do they have to build it themselves? Don't we make Oil companies perform community service and stuff as part of their deals? Oil companies don't have baby companies that do other stuff? Haba!

1032 2018-06-28 21:37:33 To be fair they are not great pics. Picked that up in town. Works well. Smaller garlic and chilli oil beside it you can't see.
1033 2018-06-28 21:37:28 Always an option! Although, old rules = oil rigs & wells required to compete. New rules = access to electricity. There’s already competition from startups & charge providers, U.S and European companies entering U.K. market in 2018/19. Anyone ‘going slow’ almost certain to lose.
1034 2018-06-28 21:37:17 I have dressing and oil all over my shirt & jeans , I don’t even know how 
1035 2018-06-28 21:37:13 Get you some oil gel, your ass will me for it.
1036 2018-06-28 21:37:05 Want the US to be like Venezuela where toilet paper & food cannot be had. A country rich with oil and no money.
1037 2018-06-28 21:37:02 What kind did you order? Not all CBD oil found online is good
1038 2018-06-28 21:36:53 Having been in the oil & gas industry for longer than I care to remember I consider the idea of oil companies being involved in the zero carbon industry let alone owning and controlling chunks of it quite concerning. The one exception is Statoil.

1051 2018-06-28 21:34:43 I need to buy my bf some beard oil. He been in the same spot for months.
1052 2018-06-28 21:34:34 Hey Zack, good question. Our engines featuring Just Check & Add™ are designed to run cleaner and cooler, so there is not a need for an annual oil change.
1053 2018-06-28 21:34:28 Wine, a book, the sound of rain and my lavender oil in the diffuser: true relaxation

1058 2018-06-28 21:33:54 Many on the left don’t vote in midterms as they are only interested in fast change revolution *snake oil* being peddled by presidential candidates. US system both due to size of population and design will inherently move slowly. Many see slow progress as corrupt and not worth it.
1059 2018-06-28 21:33:46 All things considered, he looked quite good. Pitched 5 solid innings against what is obviously not an easy lineup to get through. Left with a 3-1 lead, struck out six and believe he only walked one.
1060 2018-06-28 21:33:45 It’s like Karson saying oil  @TMcAlvain
1061 2018-06-28 21:33:39 Take 5 oil change never takes 5 minutes. They suck
1062 2018-06-28 21:33:09 There were 279 aircrew killed between 18 -20 July 1944 but some were lost on railway, oil and V weapon targets, accidents and SOE ops. Need a while...
1063 2018-06-28 21:33:07 Well, we have the resources to produce more oil and coal, not to mention natural gas that can be obtained by fracking.  As for alternative energy sources, maybe one or more can become economical in the future, but that remains to be seen.
1064 2018-06-28 21:32:55 @Firas_Zahabi i am viewing a video from a month ago, so i do not know if anyone addressed it. you would want to look into CBD oil vs THC oil for inflammation and other recovery benefits. CBD is what i believe you were referring to.
1065 2018-06-28 21:32:48 Home sales have stalled bc of lack of inventory? I think they're not building only for high end. Too many apts in Seatl
I expect the inability to find cheap labor will be a problem
I've read of slowdown, but massed by rising oil. But rising oil is not good either. 2007 recession
1066 2018-06-28 21:32:38 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=
1067 2018-06-28 21:32:36 I've been trapped in a Honda dealership getting BK's oil changed for FIVE HOURS now, and their /hOt CoUnTrY/ station is about to make my soul leave my body
1068 2018-06-28 21:32:32 We tried to use coconut oil for lube in three of my scenes and the result is very obvious

1071 2018-06-28 21:32:05 WD40 is not a good penetrating oil.
1072 2018-06-28 21:31:41 to say I’m dreading working tomorrow and Saturday in this heat is the understatement of the century, keep me out in the sun with the tanning oil please
1073 2018-06-28 21:31:16 I'll have to save up. And I'm already saving up for some heating oil for winter.
1074 2018-06-28 21:31:12 My husband bought himself a essential oil diffuser for our house.

How did I get such a winner
1075 2018-06-28 21:31:09 Alaskans own 285,238 shares of TECHNIPFMC PLC, worth $9,329,081. It's from the OIL SERVICES sector, based in UNITED KINGDOM.
1076 2018-06-28 21:31:01 It’s rumored that Optimus was rather deft with a brush, and had an affinity for 10W-30 oil paints.

1078 2018-06-28 21:30:51 Breyer is 79. Thomas is 70.

Conservatives have a lot more juice in the tank here.
1079 2018-06-28 21:30:49 Um excuse me?
Have you met me, Jesse?
All I do is worry.
Just last week I was changing the oil in my car and I worried that thing would fall on me, even though I had it up on stilts that help up to 3 tons.
1080 2018-06-28 21:30:43 I know It’s shit... tarmac is perfect temp but blinded by the sun and dying of heat stroke. That long right hander after skip browns before you go round the bends towards straight before willeymore lock... tarmac oil all risen to the surface 
1081 2018-06-28 21:30:38 Brent crude rose by US23 cents or 0.3% to US$77.85 a barrel, and the US Nymex rose by US69 cents or 0.9% to US$73.45 a barrel.

1094 2018-06-28 21:29:01 Something abt fragnance yg ramai tak berapa tahu,

Eau de Parfum- more concentrated oil + less alcohol
Eau de Toilette- less concentrated oil + more alcohol

Oil makes the fragrance last longer on skin(longevity)
Alcohol makes the fragrance projects further from skin(projection)
1095 2018-06-28 21:28:52 This was accomplished despite the material & political support the #AQ terrorists were receiving from #Italy's allies in #Tripolitania particularly the city state of #Misrata, whose leaders are currently preparing to wrench the oil facilities from the hands of #Cyrenaica's army.
1096 2018-06-28 21:28:45 The guy running the oil business is probably sponsoring their election. Hence an untouchable...
1097 2018-06-28 21:28:35 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
1098 2018-06-28 21:28:34 I heard coconut oil isn’t THAT good for skin or hair since it just sits on top and doesn’t absorb, try Moroccan oil for your hair!! It never leaves mine greasy :) or It’s A 10 is great!!

1103 2018-06-28 21:28:03 Psalm 23: 5-6 (KJV)
“Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.”
1104 2018-06-28 21:27:59 Nonsense. Primary producers supply the raw materials. They are at the whim of the market and innovation. If we develop cleaner energy, who will want that black shit called oil?
1105 2018-06-28 21:27:54 Oh good
1106 2018-06-28 21:27:50 Our hair grows a half inch each month, which equals 6 inches per year.. my hair grew a half inch in JUST two weeks from using Black Bellie Naturals Palace Growth Oil. I’m just going to let y’all do the math on that one.

1111 2018-06-28 21:27:11 Han jhuk ja lekin oil nai ha chalega
1112 2018-06-28 21:27:06 Agreed.  Commercial positioning in crude oil, equities, copper, and bonds suggest a deflationary "risk-off" move in our future.
1113 2018-06-28 21:27:04 True indicator of having your shit together: the outside of your olive oil bottle is not oily
1114 2018-06-28 21:26:57 Have they confirmed it was for Forte Oil?

1122 2018-06-28 21:26:26 Oil Tankers, trucks and the likes don't enter Owerri from Ph until it's 6pm, can only run from then till 6am..... to think I hated this cos I trade in oil
1123 2018-06-28 21:26:13 We have original engine oil pls. They should ask Korea who they bribed in China to sell Germany fake engine oil
1124 2018-06-28 21:26:06 Thats if they dont execute it in their accounts
1125 2018-06-28 21:26:00 Your recommendation of the No 7 oil/gel cleanser has been a game changer for my skin but I think it's been discontinued  none in store or online

1130 2018-06-28 21:25:32 I wold Never go back to "Coal or Oil" again.  The economics and cleanliness aren't worth the "Work" and "grime".

1132 2018-06-28 21:25:15 Josh said the relationship is in the hinges all it needs is a bit of oil to sway him.....josh oooo

1141 2018-06-28 21:23:57 and if the global oil company 'go slow' on rolling this disruptive technology out?
1142 2018-06-28 21:23:34 @SpainJoanne of course that should read Johnston’s baby oil....I could blame the heat but being of the menopausal vintage I’m quite used to the sweats
1143 2018-06-28 21:23:28 How can an oil tanker start backing up on a busy highway knowing fully well the brake is faulty
1144 2018-06-28 21:23:23 No, I mean the water is as smooth as oil
1145 2018-06-28 21:23:11 His offering was one silver charger, the weight whereof was an hundred and thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary; both of them full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering:

1147 2018-06-28 21:22:54 Oil tanker explosion kills at least 9 in Nigeria, sets dozens of cars on fire
1148 2018-06-28 21:22:46 But he fulfilled his promises!he changed the country to one of the most unsecured countries in the world,he ensured that there is more blood on the streets more than oil spill in the Niger Delta,he gave liberty to murderers ,he made us know our lives aren’t worth sh*t.
1149 2018-06-28 21:22:34 And remember that the initiative for the GFA and all its early spadework came from John Hume - not a charlatan, not a snake oil merchant, not an absolutist but a really brave, down-to-earth man of principle and peace, who well deserved his Nobel Prize.
1150 2018-06-28 21:22:34 I dropped my phone in a pot of hot oil trying to make French Fries
1151 2018-06-28 21:22:20 I wonder if that's an oil derrick in the distance at the top right? There used to be quite a number of them in the region.
1152 2018-06-28 21:22:14 In a situation like this what does otedola has to do with forte oil well many just tweet
1153 2018-06-28 21:21:59 What the f**k are you morons talking about? Thanks to #taxreform the corporations got filthy rich, bought up own stocks. We got shit! Gas is way up, heating oil was way up, health ins. Way up thanks to @GOP ! What exactly will we save with? You people need a rude awakening!

1157 2018-06-28 21:21:30 She doesn’t sound crazy at all.
1158 2018-06-28 21:21:30 As ScotGov sets its own Budgets it has nothing to do with WM - why don’t you tell the truth and remind people about the CUTS you have made to Scottish Councils, remind them of their tax increases made by YOU - you’re like snake oil salesmen of the Wild West
1159 2018-06-28 21:21:27 Finally getting my oil changed after it’s 17k miles over due

1162 2018-06-28 21:21:14 I can provide quotes from OTHERS that said precisely that the "china announced" that yuan would be exchangeable for gold on the SGE in connection with the yuan denominated oil futures contract
1163 2018-06-28 21:21:12 don't let them BS you Sanctuary Cities is a money racket just like the snake oil salesmen of days gone bye its a huge money racket you can bet they are sitting back counting their bucks and laughing all the way to the bank

1165 2018-06-28 21:21:09 Tax reform has nothing to do with it. Wait till the upcoming high temps hit. Oil and natural gas rising

1169 2018-06-28 21:20:58 He doesn't listen to the Pentagon, ever. He wants to give Putin another gift...like US sovereignty and Iranian oil wasn't enough.  He must be super desperate for Putin to increase his interference in the midterms.

1171 2018-06-28 21:20:37 Where can I buy the best Biotin and Argon Oil?
1172 2018-06-28 21:20:34 The Vote Leave "charlatans selling snake oil" ... *casts an eye across to education*
1173 2018-06-28 21:20:23 Military sacrifice people of pakistan like goats. If Pakistan get defaulted than oil medicine food can't buy from foreign countries. No country support beyond some point. They are enemy of it's own citizens. What they're getting in return for such suicidal policy.
1174 2018-06-28 21:20:21 So they tried to charge me $70 for an oil change... nah bruh! I need that price to come down about $40 tf 
1175 2018-06-28 21:20:21 What has #DaVinci to do with #AbuDhabi? What has the #Louvre to do with Abu Dhabi? Oh, they have oil billions - Okay then.
1176 2018-06-28 21:20:16 Apparently I don’t know the difference between sun cream and sun tan oil so I’ve lathered myself in sun tan oil and been in the sun all day to come out lookin like a fried lobster
1177 2018-06-28 21:20:08 then this a opportune moment for India to do a deal that would guarantee Iranian oil flowing into #Iran perhaps at even below market price fixed for period of time! Again, US can not afford to mess with India. Indian leaders should have no fear of US propaganda.

#Libya lost that much output *this week*.

OPEC et al want you to believe they have a handle on the market... but it's a moving target. #OOTT
1188 2018-06-28 21:18:20 Funny, sad, true.
1189 2018-06-28 21:18:19 I am trying to be an adult and fix my dysfunctional life. So I committed by putting coconut oil on my face every night. It seems to be working. Adulthood will give you one big i-told-you-so.
1190 2018-06-28 21:17:44 Let me get this right, you are saying Libyan oil sold by Tripoli based NOC that was loaded from Esidra and discharged in Israel by the same tanker, is that correct? Is it possible to share the name of the purchaser & dates?
1191 2018-06-28 21:17:36 Taking my car in to get the oil changed and there's so many problems it's embarrassing
1192 2018-06-28 21:17:35 Pretty much 92-93 from start to finish.

1203 2018-06-28 21:14:59 What I am saying is that the vaccines that are proven to cause zero effects are out there, the science is solid. But people choose to listen to ideas that are spread by oil companies that it’s not them causing the harm, it’s vaccines.
1204 2018-06-28 21:14:55 I miss you so much. All I want is bumps and oil with Austin right now. A voice of wisdom I could really use lately. I love you so much. I don’t know why I type this out it just makes me feel a little better.....

1208 2018-06-28 21:14:36 Ugh. 2.5 years and 10,000 miles after my head gaskets were replaced, they're leaking oil & need replacement again, but @subaru_usa is unwilling to help. Says car is too old (2002) even though low mileage. What a disappointment.
1209 2018-06-28 21:14:34 Well, UT does have its own oil well--the actual university owns it . . . .so that helps.
1210 2018-06-28 21:14:30 They just do the bare minimum if anything at all and then get fat off the milk of the land, or rather the oil of the land. 

Shii, I’m worthy but I am not stepping up to the plate. Not any time soon, if ever, anyways.
1211 2018-06-28 21:14:01 I use Paakai Cleansing Cream from honua skin care, they use laau lapaau so the redness goes away A LOT, then witch hazel for toner, then I use melaleuca for acne marks, and then oil free facial lotion
1212 2018-06-28 21:13:49 For the lamb, I have coated the leg steaks with a wee bit garlic paste and olive oil, beslapped it with many rosemary leaves, sprinkled it with salt & paprika (I don't have black pepper, don't ask me why), covered it and chucked it in the fridge till tomorrow.

1220 2018-06-28 21:12:39 They usually fill it when you get your oil changed. I use mine more than any person I know
1221 2018-06-28 21:12:39 Eliminating saturated fats from my diet led me to discover that I can't eat my favourite sugary cereal today. Motherfucking Cap'n Crunch is made with coconut oil! Fuckers >:(

1226 2018-06-28 21:11:55 I was showing my mom the 2 little scars on my legs from when an antelope attacked me and she obviously wasn't listening to the conversation when I started talking and told me it's ok that I'm getting cellulite and she'll buy me bio oil to get rid of it
1227 2018-06-28 21:11:45 I haaate being sick. I want to eat good food not bland ass toast. The chili oil beckons meeeee.
1228 2018-06-28 21:11:21 Whose oil tanker is that sef?
Our journalists keep saying "an oil tanker...". It doesn't have an owner? Where was the oil heading to?

1230 2018-06-28 21:11:05 I tried oil pulling and my teeth feel so bomb.
1231 2018-06-28 21:10:59 There are no grizzly bears in Memphis, Los Angeles isn't know for lakes, Utah isn't know for Jazz, Tennessee isnt know for oil production....
1232 2018-06-28 21:10:55 And on top of THAT, the US shut down (revealing in the process) scams by the IRGC in which the Iranian central bank was mass-printing even MORE money, dropping it into IRGC shell companies posing as oil companies, and going to the UAE and other neighboring countries...
1233 2018-06-28 21:10:55 My mind is spinning how can an oil tanker explod in Nigeria? The government & oil companies have so much to answer for. So many people have lost their lives, communities and livelihoods to the oil industry over the years. When it should've benefited the people. My heart 
1234 2018-06-28 21:10:52 I watched the debates, my favorite line was by Fry of Dyson "Huckstering snake oil salesmen", a thing of beauty & well worth the time investment.

1241 2018-06-28 21:09:42 Today, Lagos was inflamed by the dastardly explosion of an oil tanker on a bridge near berger flyover. It's still nauseating that a rich oil producing country like Nigeria lacks effective ambulance, paramedic and fire service I  the country. Our political leadership is culpable
1242 2018-06-28 21:09:39 Do we learn in this country?? 

Last four years we spent it abusing and blaming everything on one man just so that we can put another into his position. 

Now we are doing same to the man that was put in??

Can’t you see a trend or do I have 2 use oil paint and draw it for y’all
1243 2018-06-28 21:09:14 Got an email from Toyota that it’s my car’s anniversary and what’s my gift for giving them nearly $3300 over the last year? A $10 coupon off an oil change that I ALREADY get for free. Thannnnnnks
1244 2018-06-28 21:09:02 People like Vanderbilt actually Owned Railroad companies, which weren't really profitable because people were plying them, but mostly because Oil Companies were their major customers.

1247 2018-06-28 21:08:47 Coconut oil is the best thing to ever happen to me
1248 2018-06-28 21:08:46 Ijeoma of channels TV news who's shift is right now can't make it because she was stocked in the explosion this evening, this is because carefree Nigerian oil men will move petrol anywhere and anytime.
1249 2018-06-28 21:08:36 My truck started overheating and nearly exploded. Checked the engine and my oil is nearly empty and my water is all gone. I NEED a mans that will check that shit for me
1250 2018-06-28 21:08:31 Oil powered car chargers, it's the future?
1251 2018-06-28 21:08:30 Also big oil/coal...  they have destroyed a lot of water and land.  They also caused a lot of sickness to people living near plants.  But people choose to blame vaccines. It’s ignorance, and wanting to blame someone.  The science points to other sources, not vaccines.

The oil was clone ni.
1254 2018-06-28 21:08:27 1. Heat up olive oil - moderately heated
2. Pour olive oil into the ear that’s clogged
3. Plug the ear hole with some paper towel to prevent oil escaping
4. Sleep leaning on the other unplugged ear with the plugged one facing up.

If this keeps happening, see a doctor.
1255 2018-06-28 21:08:22 @jiffylube $170 for an oil change? That's insane! TWICE as much as other places, their response? Sorry our oil is expensive. Why would anyone go here? #Jiffylube #oilchange #ripoff
1256 2018-06-28 21:08:11 Food for thought Dick. FCEV’s are always going to maintain the economic hegemony of those with resources to build the H refuelling infra. Electric is a bigger threat to long term shareholder value in oil companies. What’s certain, this is the 3rd or 4th big play of so many more.

1261 2018-06-28 21:07:02 This has been going on for decades. @JesseVenturaFP covered it. The US also selling your fresh and free water to China. What are they doing with it? Storing it until there’s a deliberate and fake shortage and then it becomes the new oil.
1262 2018-06-28 21:06:58 When crude oil was first processed, Petrol was actually usually discarded because they felt it was too volatile. 
Kerosene was the only finished product used. 

John D Rockefeller was the reason we started using petrol.

1264 2018-06-28 21:06:55 || me, cooking: 
Hot oil in pan: [ bubbles up and hits me ]
Me:
Me: ah fuck, I can't believe you've done this
1265 2018-06-28 21:06:45 Well I’m a medic but all the wars were in rn are for oil so I agree we aren’t the worlds police 
1266 2018-06-28 21:06:32 Depreciation of the rupee and it's impact are no different from it was 5 years ago, especially since India's dependence on crude oil imports remains as high as 2013, if not more. What's clear from your tweet is that YOU DON'T know ANY economics!
1267 2018-06-28 21:06:31 Chavez didn't disclose he was Marxist until he had control of all branches and the military. His regime benefited from a huge rise in oil prices from 1999 until he died. This allowed him to destroy the economy and install a dictatorship while he covered up with handouts.
1268 2018-06-28 21:06:30 If you don't start shutting oil in you won't be around to see it!!! A spineless weasel and a scared women. How could us tax payers have f*cked up so bad.
1269 2018-06-28 21:06:26 my dad left me at the mall bc he forgot that he had to go take my mom to work. Now I have to lug around this gallon motor oil and a bag of stuff I bought at Wal-Mart til he gets back :^/
1270 2018-06-28 21:06:21 The previous years growth was influenced large by oil and gas sector, which does not drive really...
1271 2018-06-28 21:06:17 Kanti what’s with this oil consumption issue?I had the same problem with my Audi A5 .Fortunately for me I was helped by an Audi employee from a CPT Dealership who told me that I should go back to where I bought it & tell them to purchase a new unit to fix the oil issue
1272 2018-06-28 21:06:11 what if I’m more depressed bc I got lazy and didn’t refill my supplements so I haven’t had krill oil since Sunday
1273 2018-06-28 21:06:02 Lol.... took another tragedy ( the oil tank incident) for you people to start talking about Nigeria again. 

It was Berger to Ajah some hours ago. 


1274 2018-06-28 21:05:59 She could be praying but I doubt it
1275 2018-06-28 21:05:49 i was told olive oil is good for washing dye out of ur hair n for conditioning it n i would just like to say its actual bullshit all i have is greasy hair n a slippy floor
1276 2018-06-28 21:05:47 100% synthetic oil maybe? Plus big engine w/ lots of quarts?
1277 2018-06-28 21:05:39 He needs an eyebrow appointment to temporarily even them out and then some castor oil needs to be slathered on to grow back brows
1278 2018-06-28 21:05:22 I literally wear spf 10 tanning oil I love my italian skin hehe
1279 2018-06-28 21:05:21 Getting my oil changed and the guy in the lobby on his phone with a girl. He’s all “if you wanna come, just come. This shouldn’t be a 10 minute conversation.” 
1280 2018-06-28 21:05:20 Girl we all know you sit in the garden with the oil out at any given opportunity 
1281 2018-06-28 21:05:17 Oil Prices Risk Larger Rally as Bullish Momentum Gathers Pace
1282 2018-06-28 21:05:08 Very good tip if you’re captain of an an oil tanker
1283 2018-06-28 21:05:06 LaSalle Speedway tonight for the summernats. Coming off the heels of the successful Lucas oil  salute to troops 75 this should be a grand event. This has been your summernats tweet for night whatever. I can’t remember.
1284 2018-06-28 21:05:05 $CEI On 12/1/2017 This was trading $4.50 prior to the RS.
Plenty of room to run $$$ 
My PT $6-8 especially with the oil trending around $73
1285 2018-06-28 21:05:05 when your car gets an oil change, tire rotation, and an alignment  it sure feels like new 
1286 2018-06-28 21:05:05 why does america have so many industries where the profits of a small handful of people drastically outweigh the harm they do to society? arms industry, coal industry, oil industry
1287 2018-06-28 21:04:55 Several #banks “passed” stress test with qualifications ... financial sector trouble  #oil up  #dollar strength #gold going nowhere #Fed confused  look at me I’m Dr. Doom calling out a deflationary bubble abt2 pop #Recession #TradeWar #China #Markets #EU
1288 2018-06-28 21:04:54 I’m at a place where you can get a car wash, an oil change, a massage, a hair cut, and a meal
1289 2018-06-28 21:04:48 my buddy just texted me to say that he's too gay to change his oil in his truck. the stereotype holds up
1290 2018-06-28 21:04:42 People use DEET mosquito repellent. It’s highly effective. And #Avon ‘s Skin-so-soft body oil? Is that the one that smells like an old lady? Haha
1291 2018-06-28 21:04:33 If you live in the east and you really want to support CDN maybe you should consider putting pressure on your governments to buy CDN oil rather than oil from the USA and abroad.
1292 2018-06-28 21:04:20 I’m just so hesitant bc oil in general has always been a “bad thing” ya know :/ idk I prefer to cook w it and use it for skincare
1293 2018-06-28 21:04:17 Oil field. 
1294 2018-06-28 21:04:16 I like it but what if fuel is produced like rifles and planes etc. It can be produced by having oil. I also think ammunition and shells should be an item you need to produce. Would make the game more realistic.
1295 2018-06-28 21:04:16 Dump that bitch if he puts a moratorium on Alberta oil being transported along the northern coast but allows US coal to export out of Vancouver and occupy our rail lines
1296 2018-06-28 21:04:01 Cindy, what fuel heats your luxury building? Is it dreaded natural gas, or is it the more dreaded oil?
1297 2018-06-28 21:03:54 Hm I guess Rosemary, Argon, Castor & Peppermint oil it is I might get some jojoba
1298 2018-06-28 21:03:46 Everytime I see Deepwater Horizon it amazes me how Grown Men all left on life boats & they leave the ONLY female on the Oil Rig to possibly die? Do you think she was left cause she was Hispanic & a Female?  Naaaahhhh.  Why jump to such sad conclusions. Others lost lives too. Sad.
1299 2018-06-28 21:03:45 Yea we ain’t just going the town if that Oil ain’t in me! 
1300 2018-06-28 21:03:41 Not getting an oil change when im already at 10% gives me anxiety
1301 2018-06-28 21:03:36 get one called P20 in factor 50, nothing else works on me but that stops me burning every time, don’t get the oil tho get the cream
1302 2018-06-28 21:03:31 Those of us that lived through the sixties presume that socialism means nationalizing the banks, oil companies, telecom and others. By your standards, Truman would be a socialist.
1303 2018-06-28 21:03:20 Working on an oil rig is very dangerous.
1304 2018-06-28 21:03:05 Seriously don’t know why I’m seeing the “government” in this oil/gas tanker explosion  issue
1305 2018-06-28 21:03:02 Pls don’t mourn with them. When will our country advance and stop transporting crude oil majorly by road. If you really don’t want more of this in our Country and you do care about us. Make a provision for ship and Train as the 90% means of transporting crude oil in this country
1306 2018-06-28 21:02:54 Oh right, now you tell me, 50 years too late. Boiled over frying oil down side of stove underneath fridge. New bride. (He’s kept me though.)
1307 2018-06-28 21:02:46 As a western Canadian I am finding it hard to get too worked up about tariffs on eastern CDN based business considering the lack of support we get from eastern Canada. Maybe if the auto sector collapses the east will appreciate the oil sector more.
1308 2018-06-28 21:02:35 Karen, some places in NYC are still actually heated by dreaded “oil”. she would never live in a building like that now would she? The only reason they are using oil is because they can’t get enough gas because Governor Green Cuomo won’t let pipelines flow into NY!
1309 2018-06-28 21:02:25 Oil truck
1310 2018-06-28 21:02:23 Everyone using spontaneous as a description.. I once used stew to fry egg because I had no oil.. if that’s not spontaneous then what is ?
1311 2018-06-28 21:02:18 Everything in kenya is toxic. Toxic sugar, toxic food oil, toxic flour, toxic goverment officials and now toxic fruit juice. .....with all thise agencies in place, we are left with nothing to say but watch as our bodies are turned into toxic waste.......what a shithole republic
1312 2018-06-28 21:01:44 Okay, erasing his previous thoughts of that seeming not that much different from Asgard, Loki almost dropped his jaw as Darcy gave him the information about how he was to use the sower and measure the water, the timer, the oil infuse and --
1313 2018-06-28 21:01:13 I could drink olive oil I love it so much!
1314 2018-06-28 21:01:10 All politicians serve their own vested interests and if you think otherwise it shows your own naivety. Bush owned stock in the oil industry, with Obama is was pharmaceuticals, the Clinton's use nonprofit organizations, Biden with Lockheed, and the list goes on.
1315 2018-06-28 21:00:57 They could have been cleaning out the grease trap, and decided to clean the grills first so the oil in the grill traps could be taken away with the grease traps
1316 2018-06-28 21:00:48 Lolol I did not get an oil change today
1317 2018-06-28 21:00:48 Think she will make it through a second term of trump?
1318 2018-06-28 21:00:47 Dubai sef wey get petrol I never for one day see truck with oil  for road. But our own we go still write 33, 000 come put highly inflammable join
1319 2018-06-28 21:00:36 June 28, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1320 2018-06-28 21:00:33 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats
1321 2018-06-28 21:00:33 Someone help my change my oil
1322 2018-06-28 21:00:32 I'm doing slimming world for my sins (or is that syns?) and the amount of oil in the shop bought means if I had 2 tablespoons I couldn't eat anything else that day  so was worth trying because I LOVE houmous!
1323 2018-06-28 21:00:32 Not hard to sell snake oil when Dems offer WI nothing and don’t even campaign there. What’s your New Deal jobs program counter proposal?

1325 2018-06-28 21:00:30 #Oil prices decline following a deal announced by #OPEC to increase production via @OffshoreTechMag.
1326 2018-06-28 21:00:05 Shareholders voting it down might be the the best result. The stock is down 25% this month while the oil price is soaring. Lots of upside on a deal break.
1327 2018-06-28 21:00:00 Strong, in-depth analysis from @gabstargardter on the correlation between #Mexico's floundering oil sector and a rise in crime and violence.
1328 2018-06-28 20:59:36 What was kershaw’s fastball velo?
1329 2018-06-28 20:59:36 We aren’t meant to transport over 70% of our crude oil by road. Poor country with bad leaders in government 
1330 2018-06-28 20:59:28 Cracking finish. Oil or water based? What nap roller did you use?
1331 2018-06-28 20:59:28 I wouldn’t even know how.
1332 2018-06-28 20:59:25 Shoulda brought it to Deichlers smh I woulda changed your oil personally
1333 2018-06-28 20:59:16 India should not cut oil imports from Iran. Iran has always been a good friend and ally. 

@BJP4India @OPEC @Iran @narendramodi
1334 2018-06-28 20:59:12 Uh, yeah. Bring your oil and a filter to my dad and he’d do it for free. Too bad you live in another state.
1335 2018-06-28 20:59:03 Of course they meddled. They e always meddled.  Democrats like teddy have begged them to meddle to stop R's from getting elected. RUS wanted a weakened HC to win. She was for higher oil prices while T was for lower&more exploration. She helped RUS econ. He hurts it.
1336 2018-06-28 20:59:00 buying chimmys plushie just so I can rub castor oil on his scalp and pray for his hairs to grow
1337 2018-06-28 20:58:43 how old do u have b to buy cbd oil???
1338 2018-06-28 20:58:29 Renewables are as free market as oil and gas.  Or automobiles.  Or hydro. Or Ferries, or - almost anything in a mixed market economy.
1339 2018-06-28 20:58:28 If you call being conned by snake oil salesmen who want to cash in on your #brexit vote to make millions on the financial markets “winning” then good luck to you. You won. Well done. Enjoy it whilst it lasts. Some people get taken advantage of all their lives.

#PeoplesVote
1340 2018-06-28 20:58:17 Bruh mine too like idk what it is because I’ve only been drinking water the sun & whatever oil is in my hair has to be the reason
1341 2018-06-28 20:58:15 Peppermint oil!!
1342 2018-06-28 20:58:10 Just oil and vinegar salad dressing with eggs mixed in. Grow up.
1343 2018-06-28 20:57:49 car maintenance is real everyone... don’t forget to check your oil
1344 2018-06-28 20:57:36 accidentally licked tea tree oil and now im gonna cry this is what hell tastes like
1345 2018-06-28 20:57:12 Oh it's the month of June yh? It's no longer ember month that's killing people according to your pastors yh?
Won kuku ti fi brains yin shey trade by barter ni church. Brain for Goya oil
1346 2018-06-28 20:57:08 A cyst is a benign growth that forms as a result of an infection, clogging of sebaceous glands (oil glands), or around foreign bodies, such as earrings. They often feel like small peas beneath your skin’s surface.
1347 2018-06-28 20:56:44 Plot twist: she been had that tat. He just put some oil on and rubbed for the culture
1348 2018-06-28 20:56:44 You are confusing two issues. Scotland did not have the resources to develop N.Sea oil. The majority of cash was English. We joined the EU as Britain, we will leave as Britain.
1349 2018-06-28 20:56:36 I think it is a positive move. We will see the other oil companies doing similar things moving forward or installing their own EVSE at forecourts. The world is changing and BP have taken the first step to keep up with these changes and protect their retail business.
1350 2018-06-28 20:56:32 I was blocked for pointing out that electric cars do not need oil for the 'engine'! 
1351 2018-06-28 20:56:22 I've done mine since days ago
1352 2018-06-28 20:56:17 " Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:
And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him"
1353 2018-06-28 20:56:11 drink castor oil ! it helps helllla !!
1354 2018-06-28 20:56:00 Just got my artwork returned from college board today... happy to say that my artwork is 100% intact, but my oil painting got messed up a bit 
1355 2018-06-28 20:55:57 Olive oil definitely .  Console yourself that making houmous is as pointless as labouring over one's own puff or filo pastry: far too much effort to bother with for the end result, when the pros always do it better. Keep them in a job .
1356 2018-06-28 20:55:46 Have 2018 Toyota Camry that needs an oil change? Well you're in luck, your favorite team in Hallsville now stocks the new 0W16 oil for your car. Come see us!
1357 2018-06-28 20:55:44 Just SOLD 1 @ 73.175 Crude Oil miNY Aug18 closing longs ▷$QM_F from my @iBroker iPhone App
1358 2018-06-28 20:55:37 I can almost taste the Abramelin Oil now.
1359 2018-06-28 20:55:26 Why, Reed is putting Sue in her place...again, while giant manatees fly over an ocean of burning oil and Tony thinks about having hisself a lil’ drinky drink, of course.
1360 2018-06-28 20:55:26 We don’t need oil anymore. Seriously. If we did, Venezuela would be ours by now. Syria was about oil too. But Israel wanted that oil and had already sold the rights. Yet, Trump didn’t go full war to help them in Golan.
1361 2018-06-28 20:55:16 Ok well it’s so hot in my room that my coconut oil has melted fuck sake
1362 2018-06-28 20:55:10 Equally applies to Iranian sanctions and continuing to sanction both Vz and Iran at same time in face of rising oil due to tightening conditions simply is not strategically optimal move at this time.
1363 2018-06-28 20:54:56 So you had extensive conversations with Maxine where she shared previously unexpressed feelings that she wanted to shoot and kill the media?
1364 2018-06-28 20:54:46 Jamaican black castor beard oil
1365 2018-06-28 20:54:39 Peppermint: Comice pears, apples, oranges arrive with Godiva milk chocolate chip, garlic onion dip mix, green olive oil crackers
1366 2018-06-28 20:54:17 Tankers cant move at night because a lot of them are hijacked at nights and some tanker drivers do oil bunkering. So you can't go inter state after 6pm and 6am. In most developed countries tankers still move petrol. Solution is ensure that tankers are in good shape
1367 2018-06-28 20:54:08 Just because you bought the snake oil from Don the Con doesn't mean we all want a bottle.
1368 2018-06-28 20:54:06 When I was a manager of a gym day spa I tanned way too much but still put sunscreen on my face  hey I have never claimed I was smart but olive oil is great for skin and hair!
1369 2018-06-28 20:54:03 I threatened Audi with legal action on third request to rectify high oil consumption of my B8 A4 2.0T. They replaced my pistons and had a like-for-like newer courtesy car. Sold it 10 months later when they informed me the repair warranty period is only 12months.
1370 2018-06-28 20:53:59 Today Maddie and I met a very nice man while getting are moms oil changed. He began talking about how he has lung cancer and how he only has 24 months to live. I believe this shows how you never know what people may be going through, just be kind.
1371 2018-06-28 20:53:58 The napalm screams of human flames
Of a prime time Belsen feast ... yeah!
As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy
We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies. #LegacyOfTheBeast
1372 2018-06-28 20:53:48 I accidentally got tea tree oil in my mouth and fuck that shit is disgusting
1373 2018-06-28 20:53:44 WTI Crude Oil +0.9% at 73.37 bbl $USO
Gold -0.4% to 1250.80 oz $GLD
Copper -1.0% to 2.95 lb  $CU
1374 2018-06-28 20:53:40 These are oil tankers of the powerful men/politicians in Nigeria. They are above the law and they have the leaders in their pocket. There is no safety procedures to follow...They operate in the country without any restrictions because they are major election sponsors.
1375 2018-06-28 20:53:26 My grandmother and mother use to coat the squash flowers in seasoned flour and fry them in olive oil. They were yummy. New York italian yumminess 
1376 2018-06-28 20:53:18 Chale, killings and things 
Now explosion of oil tanker on the Otedola bridge
1377 2018-06-28 20:53:17 This container belongs to a particular oil company, who are they?
1378 2018-06-28 20:53:13 I understand 'primrose oil' is good.

If you smoke enough of it.
1379 2018-06-28 20:53:01 The economy is booming. We’re transporting loads for forestry, construction , railroad , farming, oil & natural gas industries everyday.
1380 2018-06-28 20:52:51 I just recently tried Macadamia Oil .
1381 2018-06-28 20:52:38 Just saw an ad for "intelligent asphalt." I'll tell you what is most intelligent: replacing all asphalt roads with concrete roads; much cooler and won't wear down your tires in hot weather. Asphalt is another means of buying oil. #concreteissmarter
1382 2018-06-28 20:52:28 Look at all the diet snake oil they sell!
1383 2018-06-28 20:52:18 It's actually a retrograde step. It puts drivers back under the thumb of a major oil company which is what BEVs & FCEVs were supposed to avoid.
1384 2018-06-28 20:52:16 If the Nigerian Government gave Oil Companies rights to construct Railways, and gave 6 months notice for a ban on Fuel Tankers, we could have a working railway system in no time.
1385 2018-06-28 20:52:09 No, you only care about Iran because Trump and his allies told you to care about Iran. There are plenty of other revolutions going on in the world, but your passion just happens to go to the country with the fourth largest oil reserve on the planet in a key strategic region.
1386 2018-06-28 20:52:05 Another potential tragedy are those tankers queuing from ojuelegba to Apapa blocking free flow of traffic. I guess they are untouchable cos most of those tankers are owned by the politicians in oil and gas business
1387 2018-06-28 20:52:05 All of my hygiene products are Coconut Oil .
1388 2018-06-28 20:51:33 2p Getting a quick oil change before my trip.  I googled a coupon from @jiffylube.  Googling coupons is something I do daily.
1389 2018-06-28 20:51:33 Prayers for all involved in the oil accident in Lagos. 
1390 2018-06-28 20:51:24 They know the Equiniox has bad piston rings and consumes oil but won’t do anything about it. A brand new Chevy lasts no more than a few years.
1391 2018-06-28 20:51:23 holy trinity? SOPHIE reconceptualized organized religion w 'oil of every pearl's un-insides' so tht such laymen's terms are wholly unnecessary ,, the bible says to love thy neighbor and yet SOPHIE's 'ponyboy' depicts an immensely errotic love tht is anything but neighborly
1392 2018-06-28 20:51:12 Why don't you report the whole truth? We've been here over and over again. Big oil opens up and create jobs then they cut down and the state suffers. Yet we still give Big oil huge tax breaks. This state needs to diversify!
1393 2018-06-28 20:51:03 Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; ...

KJV. Numbers 5:15a
1394 2018-06-28 20:50:50 Is not a bout oil hasan hustler wc or makar on RAWA rontek you tobe video,MUSYRIKIN people not alowed come to makah for umroh or ibadah hajj
1395 2018-06-28 20:50:37 It doesn't have to be "how to fix your car" but more of "if the light is out, takes 10 mins at pep boys" or "put your oil changes on the calendar, watch for a coupon"
1396 2018-06-28 20:50:20 I was thought the whole body is an Awrah since I was a kid.. That was why I was so curious... And haven't heard any of the scholars preaching about it. Then I saw that and was so excited about it. Masha Allah walhamdulillah

1398 2018-06-28 20:50:14 The UK didn't declare war on the USSR, even though it had also invaded Poland and had allied itself with Hitler, because the UK was terrified of losing its oil fields in Iraq & Iran. If it had gone to war with the USSR Stalin would have invaded India too.

1436 2018-06-28 20:45:32 So angry. Garages mistake of not replacing oil cap, means oil all over my engine, inside of bonnet and down front of my car. Add to that had to fork out for oil to replace the oil I paid them for putting in during service and mot! Fizzing mad!!

1438 2018-06-28 20:45:16 I will not be surprised if that happens. Remember Oil extraction has started in Ogaden too. Ethiopia wants to turn all who are against it to their side. ONLF are meeting in Eritrea to decide their next action. Very interesting developments.
1439 2018-06-28 20:45:15 It's taken the Cubs all of 5 mins to put the pressure on the Dodgers and try to grab the lead for the first time this afternoon. Not surprisingly, it has coincided with the departure of one Clayton Kershaw. ;)

1444 2018-06-28 20:44:46 Not surprised at all. Don’t buy into the whole “Minnesota is a liberal wonderland” narrative. The public utilities commission just approved a multi billion dollar pipeline that will transport tar sands oil from Alberta Canada to Lake Superior threatening everything in its path.

1466 2018-06-28 20:41:26 Yes it makes sense, but if it still smells good, that means there’s still remnants of the oil in there. I didn’t think it was safe to inhale those fumes or ingest essential oils in any way. But if it works for you it works for me. I was just curious.
1467 2018-06-28 20:41:26 Why nobody ever told me tea tree oil was so strong  that shit smells like medicine sitting on ur face

1487 2018-06-28 20:39:31 How about protecting the St Lawrence river. Ban oil tankers like you did for BC and stop permitting sewage dumps into the St. Lawrence river which is a drinking water supply for many.
1488 2018-06-28 20:39:30 y’all really need to try hemp seed oil. a life changer. you need emollients and specific oils (depending on skin type) like that to protect your lipid barrier and prevent dehydration and fine lines! i have the oiliest skin (still gets dehydrated)
1489 2018-06-28 20:39:13 I bought my mom an oil diffuser and the one I got her is way better than mine lmao I’m upset.
1490 2018-06-28 20:39:11 This does not bode well for oil.
1491 2018-06-28 20:39:09 Ha ha ! I agree. I asked in AB: why do you dig for oil if it costs 60/barrel and selling price is 50? Answer typical for AB: because it is there. Good enough for me.....
1492 2018-06-28 20:39:09 Yes, it was. And thanks to the constant wars and sanctions and other nonsense the US does in the ME, oil prices have risen dramatically since then. One of the reasons why electric cars are good: Oil prices will go way down.
1493 2018-06-28 20:39:04 I need my oil changed soon
1494 2018-06-28 20:38:56 First of all in a sane society, why would a tanker fully loaded with highly inflammable substance ply the road at day time along side other vehicles. Greed has made the government, owners of this tankers and oil companies ignore safety precautions because it is NIGERIA.
1495 2018-06-28 20:38:53 come back soon pls. Bring oil and big hats.

1533 2018-06-28 20:34:22 Just tried making houmous for the first time. It was... partially successful? I definitely think it needs olive oil but I didn't have any. And also my blender is literal garbage in that it really does belong in the bin 
1534 2018-06-28 20:34:20 vape oil. Please I must see
1535 2018-06-28 20:34:09 So you are saying the other 90% are available for whatever? Now I know what to do with my pile of truck batteries, used tires and motor oil.
1536 2018-06-28 20:34:08 Yes! I asked him what happened and he said the guy ran it out of oil
1537 2018-06-28 20:34:08 Thank goodness there’s subtitles. Not many of us speak Cherokee.

1539 2018-06-28 20:33:54 #gold, #oil, and #bitcoin sitting in the negative today. Gold being a traditional safe haven for #investors, where do you keep your #money?
1540 2018-06-28 20:33:53 Who is saying it’s shite? No one is saying Neck Oil is going to be shit tomorrow. What we don’t know is in a years time. Heineken haven’t done this deal because they love craft beer, they have done it to make money and they are scared
1541 2018-06-28 20:33:39 Oh well, the Rockefeller heirs withdrew investments from oil a few years ago. Guess BP is making the very gradual transition?.... Actually, I just like gawking at your  television face :) 
1542 2018-06-28 20:33:21 This makes me remember the oil tankers along mombasa rd that share the same road with other cars  esp during rush hour..the govt still has not designated special routes for these tankers..all african govts are just the same when it comes to responsibility
1543 2018-06-28 20:33:13 It's a common error.
People were using Cooking oil and ended up calling it fish Oil.

So fish oil is a used Cooking oil that fried the fish.
1544 2018-06-28 20:33:11 Misrata prevents animal feeds from coming out & foodstuffs r attached 2 it from city's port after army decided 2 hand over oil ports to oil company Barqah. This decision is aimed at Barqah & stop all food supplies & animal feeds. All food credits from Tripoli bank go 2 Misrata
1545 2018-06-28 20:33:08 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.

1547 2018-06-28 20:32:49 Simple restriction of petroleum or inflammable tankers could have saved the lives of innocent souls wasted today but hell no, some oil influential merchants and rich must make money

1550 2018-06-28 20:32:42 Also making plans for the middle East. His plans for us to go back to Iraq to get the oil there. Its all about the oil.
1551 2018-06-28 20:32:19 What's worse, is its obvious to everyone that it's snake oil, but somehow he still gets the spotlight.
1552 2018-06-28 20:32:17 Someone come get my car and take it to get an oil change I don’t have time
1553 2018-06-28 20:32:02 The man who ordered the group's oil depots, refineries, and cash vaults.
1554 2018-06-28 20:31:55 Get your head out of the sand! Americans strongly believe in Medicare for all, tuition free college, ICE abolishment, criminal justice reform, ending dependence on foreign oil, etc. The Democratic establishment (not in quotes) can either step up or crumble like the GOP in 2010
1555 2018-06-28 20:31:51 Well, sure, you can blame them for THAT... ;)

I don't think anyone is "buying" yet, I think it's all just POCs. I also haven't met any charlatans or snake oil salespeople yet.

I'm not advocating for them. Just reserving judgement until things become more clear.
1556 2018-06-28 20:31:23 Pipelines and Oil rigs and get this Country Moving again , and just forget about the milk …#2019
1557 2018-06-28 20:31:12 I would having been there and paid more for a litre of water in a garage than for a gallon of petrol. We are not a primary sector economy dependent on the price of oil. That is Scotland!
1558 2018-06-28 20:31:10 Remember that nose dive flight I took a few days ago? Methinks it was a metaphor  Now if I could just put my finger on what the plane might represent...hmm let’s see, something enormous and powerful and drunk on oil spiraling out of control towards its inevitable demise... 
1559 2018-06-28 20:31:05 I can feel the baby oil gel rolling down my legs
1560 2018-06-28 20:31:04 They failed trying to destroy renewables and EVs so now they're doing what they should've tried in the first place: make money off of them. It only took the oil industry a few decades and cost the environment critically, but this seems at least the right direction
1561 2018-06-28 20:30:57 The extractive industries on their own are an economic blessing to any society. Economic mismanagement, riding the oil wave hard to the detriment of viable sectors, and ofcourse the population. No planning, and no REAL development. Just oil
1562 2018-06-28 20:30:48 Those who are criticizing #RupeeInICU From today onwards they are going to buy oil directly from iran, coz rupee is in icu.
#dramebaz
1563 2018-06-28 20:30:35 que indice vc usa para cmdtys, HB ? há alguns que não revisam muito os pesos e daí o OIL contamina. Mas, de uma forma ou outra, qdo andam de fato elas vem em bando. Eu costumava olhar o RICI em função dos pesos
1564 2018-06-28 20:30:33 Do you want England to take most of the benefit if Scottish oil, energy, water, produce etc etc etc 

FFS, they screw us enough, we don’t need any Scottish sycophants wanting them to win the World Cup as well surely

1569 2018-06-28 20:30:14 so you support foriegn oil and foriegn anything which would eliminate any job outside store clerk or starbucks coffee counter brilliant idea
1570 2018-06-28 20:30:07 Aïe aïe aïe...
1571 2018-06-28 20:29:55 I think the oil companies in charge of the tankers should at least pay a compensation to as many families affected as possible.
1572 2018-06-28 20:29:53 Which cost taxpayers four billion and the company already considering moving. Go manufacture some more snake oil to sell
1573 2018-06-28 20:29:51 I use olive oil and other veggies and just make myself fried rice
1574 2018-06-28 20:29:41 Alsup threw out the climate change lawsuit saying it was unfair to penalize oil companies for giving us what we wanted.
1575 2018-06-28 20:29:22 I had to drive over fresh oil and chips in my new car and wanted to die.
1576 2018-06-28 20:29:15 Not enough oil there to bother.
1577 2018-06-28 20:29:12 no i’m genuinely so sunburnt i will never use coconut oil to tan myself ever again
1578 2018-06-28 20:29:09 Get ready for oil company price gouging at the pump! Obama did not allow oil company price gouging. Trump will! Expect $5 a gal under Trump.
1579 2018-06-28 20:29:06 #Nigeria is just a death trap. Everywhere you turn, there’s death around the corner

Citizens are sitting ducks for BH, herdsmen, Sars, Police, Armed robbers, kidnappers, falling containers &amp; oil tanker explosions.

This is a jungle and everything in it will KILL you.
1580 2018-06-28 20:28:58 Is it coincidence that CBD oil and Mexican home remedy of putting weed in rubbing alcohol have the same affect? I think not!
1581 2018-06-28 20:28:47 Chinese group upset at claims over gutter oil...
1582 2018-06-28 20:28:36 Man I think you should create cosmetic lines for man. Di beard oil, sun cream, face what what
1583 2018-06-28 20:28:30 Golden Age - Midnight Oil
1584 2018-06-28 20:28:27 Democrats and the constitution like oil and water
1585 2018-06-28 20:28:24 I was buying all of these expensive ass products and now the only thing that really works is leave in conditioner, oil and Eco styler SMH
1586 2018-06-28 20:28:08 It's sad that many people don't get the joke...
1587 2018-06-28 20:28:01 Perhaps she’s nicked a bit of that cannabis oil
1588 2018-06-28 20:27:40 Had to take bae to get a oil change an a rotation so she can SKURT SKURT!!!!
1589 2018-06-28 20:27:32 You want to arrest Dangote's trailer or Otedola's Forte Oil tankers? Lol.
1590 2018-06-28 20:27:23 Fresh oil change
1591 2018-06-28 20:27:21 I've tried sooooo many leave-in conditioners. I give up and try another and another and they are all wack...!! Even Shea Moisture and i had high hopes for them 

I'm gonna stick to what i know, normal conditioner mixed with my fav oil, does the job
1592 2018-06-28 20:27:20 They are cultists and have gotten rich fromngun lobby,big pharma,oil,and others!
They love their geavy train! MUST STOP IT!!
VOTE BLUE IN EVERY ELECTION TO GET THEM ALL OUT!!
1593 2018-06-28 20:27:11 I’m stuck on the side of the road because my freaking car is low on oil 
1594 2018-06-28 20:27:11 And there were conditions attached including:
-   becomes the currency for oil trading
- gold standard replaced by   standard
- allies fight wars when called upon to counter , , & any other  enemy
1595 2018-06-28 20:27:01 yeah, versus the $20 I spend now on my electric bill - makes a big difference! Also no oil changes, which was smaller (but still existing) savings
1596 2018-06-28 20:26:52 Fish oil & what oil?
1597 2018-06-28 20:26:45 "Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over." ✞Psalms 23:5 #Jesus #God #Bible
1598 2018-06-28 20:26:43 I've got an appt next week to do exactly that & an appt to try out homeopathy & meantime I'm very impressed by coconut oil.
1599 2018-06-28 20:26:26 She might give a low effort, but I have a say too!
1600 2018-06-28 20:26:24 China started buying oil with Yuan. If this goes well I think US will have some serious problem to handle.
1601 2018-06-28 20:26:20 The feet, according to the more correct opinion, is not regarded as part of Awra. However, due to the difference of opinion with regards to it, """it would be more precautious and advisable to cover them, as it will be explained in detail later.""""
1602 2018-06-28 20:26:18 hmu if you need I  OIL shirts
1603 2018-06-28 20:26:06 @DrMichaelLBrown I'm interested in your thoughts on the flowing oil from the Bible in Dalton Ga. I'm from a more conservative theological background and really struggle with the validity of this. Help me understand. Thanks.
1604 2018-06-28 20:26:05 Just a friendly reminder that rockerfeller has been transporting oil by rail since the 19th century
1605 2018-06-28 20:26:02 Hahahaha are you sure they didn’t give you the old oil as your coffee?
1606 2018-06-28 20:25:56 I use salmon oil for my boxer
1607 2018-06-28 20:25:35 Yup. And one of those numbers is from before the floor fell out of the price of oil - the other is from last year.
Kenney knows that and he’s grasping with this attack.
1608 2018-06-28 20:25:25 She lost it she still thinks matlock is still on tv Its her favorite
1609 2018-06-28 20:25:18 Making popcorn with coconut oil. Let’s see.
1610 2018-06-28 20:25:15 I do executive rentals in calgary Alberta canada and I am a realtor as well. It is really high rental rates here as well. Especially with oil and gas price going up and staying up.
1611 2018-06-28 20:25:13 Has anyone discovered why the citizens of south and central America are fleeing their socialist paradises. Venezuela has just about destroyed itself. It went from being a slightly corrupt oil backed nation, to a non-functioning socialist hellhole.
Bernie should go down to help.
1612 2018-06-28 20:25:04 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.
1613 2018-06-28 20:24:08 Yes lol lotion at night body oil in the morning.
1614 2018-06-28 20:24:08 I need the body oil @chrissyteigen came out with 
1615 2018-06-28 20:24:06 Hallelujah! I don't use marijuana. But my wife could potentially benefit from cannibals oil to control seizures.
1616 2018-06-28 20:23:58 Olive oil?
1617 2018-06-28 20:23:56 Apparently the trick is to fry cold cooked rice. I use uncle Ben's micro rice but I fry it straight out of the pack. I fry it in a little sesame oil until it's browning then add soy sauce.
Then I cook the tofu. I press the tofu (cauldron or tofoo) and crumble it between...
1618 2018-06-28 20:23:49 Iran sanctions could force the masses to look for alternatives and oil nations will lose
1619 2018-06-28 20:23:46 Agreed. I've always thought, for example, that a dem priority should be actually regulating supplements, so that alex jones etc can't make money peddling snake oil. The less money they have the better.

Not sure what would be an appropriate solution for Fox News etc
1620 2018-06-28 20:23:31 oil
1621 2018-06-28 20:23:12 An oil tanker blew up and took half the road with it.
1622 2018-06-28 20:23:12 Woahoho
1623 2018-06-28 20:23:00 My dad literally only does oil changes and minor repairs  for his kids, and he constantly has oil and grease stained hands and smells like a mechanic for DAYS! It will be the farm girl who will notice it first.
1624 2018-06-28 20:22:53 New brakes and an oil change make my #fiat500 roll like a dream
1625 2018-06-28 20:22:49 my hair is naturally curly but i use avocado oil & mayo hair conditioner 
1626 2018-06-28 20:22:40 2024
1627 2018-06-28 20:22:22 Judging by the series of cars involved, the tanker was obviously spilling oil all along with no regard to the danger being caused. Why are we so reckless in this country? Why are oil tankers allowed to commute with other road users? So many whys in Nigeria.. God help us #RIP
1628 2018-06-28 20:22:21 Just bought 1000mg #cbd_oil #vape love taking that hit and puffing like a dragon
1629 2018-06-28 20:22:17 Oil tanker exploded while stuck in traffic congestion... 
1630 2018-06-28 20:22:06 I need to quit being lazy and do my oil change already
1631 2018-06-28 20:22:05 Oh, silly me, England already have a tap into Scottish water; and oil, whiskey, produce, energy etc etc etc......... 

How sad.
1632 2018-06-28 20:22:04 For a fact lol. That store bought shit is out. But to keep you face moisturized use %100 Tea Tree Oil bra. It’s great for your skin and hair too
1633 2018-06-28 20:21:53 One day y’all are gna have to learn to appreciate dark skin women without marinating them in baby oil
1634 2018-06-28 20:21:52 I noticed the look on the King of Jordan's face when he was in the US. It was not good. Trump intends to expel the Palestinians. He is looking at the real estate & oil perspectives of that region & not Peace. He sees a Trump tower on the sea of Gaza.
1635 2018-06-28 20:21:40 Ya and causing trade barriers and rising the oil price by blocking all Iranian oil and blocking other countries to that oil as well.  Banning Venezuela oil as well..
1636 2018-06-28 20:21:36 ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota regulators approve Enbridge Energy plan for replacing deteriorating Line 3 oil pipeline, but route unsettled.
1637 2018-06-28 20:21:04 Seeing this oil tanker explosion in Nigeria and I cannot help but think of all the possible transportation violations the company must have committed + visible hazards ignored to be fixed at a later date 
Rest in peace to the victims. Quite sad.
1638 2018-06-28 20:20:53 I need to give him some annoiting oil on his legs.
1639 2018-06-28 20:20:53 Retweet if oil tankers should be kept of the roads #otedolabridge #thirdmainland
1640 2018-06-28 20:20:52 Alright, the master says you take an empty water bottle and fill it back up with more water + a variety of visually appealing liquids/objects: food coloring, oil, hair gel, glitter, glue, marbles, small beads, etc. Recap & tape to seal. Essentially a fancy snow globe in a bottle.
1641 2018-06-28 20:20:49 So many girls swallow sperm comfortably but when they give them anointing oil to drink..swallowing becomes a problem 
1642 2018-06-28 20:20:40 No they are business men,their interest is deducted before our oil sales are remitted to us,it's good business for them and our dumb leaders.
1643 2018-06-28 20:20:38 Qalbidhagax's release was to draw attention away from the oil they are stealing in the somali region. Ethiopia is always an enemy.
1644 2018-06-28 20:20:35 Yeah bro , any type of oil or extract
1645 2018-06-28 20:20:28 ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - Minnesota regulators approve Enbridge Energy plan for replacing deteriorating Line 3 oil pipeline, but route unsettled.
1646 2018-06-28 20:20:25 While we in this topic why is it called fish oil?
1647 2018-06-28 20:20:22 Trump knows how to drive Gas/Oil prices up!
The rest of the world will do the opposite of what he says! Sad!
1648 2018-06-28 20:20:14 Oil and footjobs 
1649 2018-06-28 20:19:46 80% of my makeup routine is just blotting oil
1650 2018-06-28 20:19:22 I am of the opinion that the economic model argument to our problems isn't as relevant as the fiscal federalism one. The unitary system was supposed to be a stopgap political stabilizer by Ironsi following the '66 coup. It was never an economic decision. But oil is sweet.
1651 2018-06-28 20:19:22 JUST IN: Minnesota regulators approve Enbridge Energy plan for replacing deteriorating Line 3 oil pipeline, but route unsettled.

1656 2018-06-28 20:18:49 After work today I have to dip my family photograph is anointing oil. I rebuke untimely death for everyone.
1657 2018-06-28 20:18:44 getting my oil changed in a town I just moved to but the guy helping me is convinced I come here all the time so I just went with it and got the manager's discount so now I do go here all the time
1658 2018-06-28 20:18:42 The 5th largest oil producing country,the poorest country,neck deep in debt. Spent trillions of $s yet no electricity,no infrastructure,no education,no healthcare. We will remain the dark continent for a while longer.
1659 2018-06-28 20:18:37 im in need of an oil change. i wonder if theres enough change in my truck to fund that lol
1660 2018-06-28 20:18:22 That is an awesome idea!  Let’s start with the US Navy Fifth Fleet.  Protecting your oil in the Persian Gulf since 1995.
1661 2018-06-28 20:18:17 I don’t like waiting on oil changes with my phone on a low battery ...
1662 2018-06-28 20:18:05 had a dream last night John Lewis started selling a range of skin creams infused with CBD oil
1663 2018-06-28 20:18:00 Dont say invalid,you're not in the position to invalidate matters of dispute, just pick the one that best suites you and perfect your intentions, it has been celebrated long before you by great scholars and Ulamas .
1664 2018-06-28 20:17:52 Oil change take so long like come on 
1665 2018-06-28 20:17:49 The oil spilled from the tanker. No full details yet.
1666 2018-06-28 20:17:43 I'm getting my oil changed in Maryland watching local coverage of the #Annapolis shooting. I teach journalism students. The anti-press rhetoric of the right & the president can't be separated from this violence
1667 2018-06-28 20:17:35 Tell Perry to shut-up.  He has negative pull on oil, nothing.  Trump is using him to reverse jaw bone.  Most don’t even know who he even is.

1670 2018-06-28 20:17:20 hair continued:
•add a spoon of coconut oil into your palms and rub through hair, braid {or plait} and leave in for 1 hour then wash as normal, this promotes hair growth
•use castor oil for growing hair and keeping it healthy
•try using minimal heat only after a wash(dry)

1683 2018-06-28 20:16:24 Here’s a tip about popcorn. Put the heat on high, pour little oil (not too thick, not too thin. Just right). Put the popcorn mielies in. Never open the pot until the popping has stopped. If you open it, the cold air increases the chances of it going bad.

1690 2018-06-28 20:15:51 Okay, beyond all the Sangh fun going around about the devaluation of the Rupee, here is my understanding:

1. India needlessly propped up INR during the days of low oil prices.

2. It should have gradually devalued INR during that time.

3. This is a forced devaluation by

1698 2018-06-28 20:15:10 Nigeria is beginning to look like the American frontier of 19th century. Everyday people die in this country in large numbers. If disease don't kill u,  Fulani heardsmen will, or an oil tanker cud just explode and kill u. Or the police cud just shoot u for no reason. My God!!!

1701 2018-06-28 20:14:56 Oil coys have seen themselves as oil coys not as energy coys.  Good to see it changing,  however most inv still on exploration not new start ups.  However dividends dwarf exploration for BP.  Moving slowly beyond petroleum.  Euro oil coys transitioning faster.  Dong statoil etc.
1702 2018-06-28 20:14:37 After so many failed avocados (under or over ripe) I got three for a pound today at Walthamstow market which were 'goldilocks' avocados. A little lemon juice, olive oil and sea salt was all it took to put them away. Nice.

They're as corrupt as big oil, pharma, banks and are eliminating jobs that actually interest people. American Dream has never been to rot at a desk and code.

1717 2018-06-28 20:12:54 This was shredded chicken, kalamata olives, cherry tomatoes, feta and cucumber, with a lemon and olive oil dressing with a hint of flat leafed parsley and mint. Wrapped in a multi-grain wrap with hummus. So yes, a mini-buffet!
1718 2018-06-28 20:12:46 I feel like the truth is somewhere in between. I dont think the Oilers are happy with Lucic and I don't think he's thrilled with how things have turned out. No trade request, but i think they understand he's willing to waive for the right situation and that the Oil and looking.
1719 2018-06-28 20:12:46 I’ve spent $50+ on fancy essential oils for my warmer and they were horrible. All the while this $2 fragrance oil from the family dollar is the best I’ve ever had

1723 2018-06-28 20:11:50 This is a fair point. I suggest holding the tournament in smaller countries. Best to stick to tiny, oil rich Arab states.
1724 2018-06-28 20:11:46 Not only is palm oil in far too many products but is also hidden under many other aliases. Bring back home baking and stop feeding the corporate giants.

1744 2018-06-28 20:09:30 OK, well maybe save some of your vitriol for them. Blaming Stein voters is like trying to solve climate change by yelling at people you see driving instead of protesting oil companies.

1768 2018-06-28 20:06:36 Got my car detailed for the first time ever. Backed out of the driver's side door and promptly got grease all over the back of my work shirt from the oil they used on the panel. 

Adulting is so hard ya'll.
1769 2018-06-28 20:06:33 I'm sure since this is marketed towards dogs it /should/ be fine, but in general tea tree oil is toxic for dogs. Have you used this shampoo before?
1770 2018-06-28 20:06:32 This is FASCINATING, Daniel. This is a massive big deal for home mayo manufacture. I use a Kenwood Chef balloon whisk for that, and have always shied from olive oil because of this bitter straw man. Thanks for going the extra mile.
1771 2018-06-28 20:06:20 If you think you are powerless, indeed you are. The Minister should be execution insane not writing op-eds about "How to" on his mandate.

1772 2018-06-28 20:06:12 That was certainly true years ago here in Texas. I haven’t heard anything different. I know some legal immigrants that took nearly 7 years to become citizens. One of them had a very wealthy oil and gas legend acting as his advocate and he couldn’t speed the process up.
1773 2018-06-28 20:06:05 Olive oil is definitely heavy for me.I used to add that with conditioner. It would make a difference but I notice in a couple of days my hair was dry. I got the almond oil from Whole Foods. I think Walmart has it too though

1783 2018-06-28 20:04:19 The problem with that ridiculous advert from @hdactech featuring 'blockchain technology' is that 99.99999999999% of those watching don't have the faintest idea what it's about. Where as the 0.000000000001% who do have a clue think it's hyperbole and snake oil.

1793 2018-06-28 20:03:07 There's huge amounts of money being made by cos chasing renewable government subsidies. There's vast sums of taxes being generated by governments. Yes. Oil companies are doing just fine looking at the average EPS.

1798 2018-06-28 20:02:22 I like almond oil. Coconut oil has too much protein for my hair type so it dries it out.
1799 2018-06-28 20:02:05 I don't tan, just burn and peel. I remember in the 80s lying out in the sun for hours slathered in baby oil or butter -- literally broiling myself. So stupid, but back then we didn't know any better.
1800 2018-06-28 20:01:59 Argh. It's hard! I've got round this a bit by making 'healthy' cakes e.g using olive oil and honey instead of butter and sugar. Then trying to keep portion small....sometimes impossible...usually I have 2 naughty days in the week when I eat anything I like!

1818 2018-06-28 19:59:28 people blame the president for thousands of things the federal government has little to absolutely nothing to do with.

1819 2018-06-28 19:59:23 Sure, fine.  but how much oil could a billion people use?
1820 2018-06-28 19:59:23 Not all palm oil comes from deforestation. Palm oil from West Africa for example is responsibly and naturally sourced. Rather than attack people that need palm oil as part of their day to day nutritious and balanced diets. Direct criticism towards the greedy corporations.
1821 2018-06-28 19:58:55 Around the managers and influencers, how serious are they? In 2015, what was being said was, "South Sudan oil for South Sudanese". Khartoum was locked out but now, we see it has bounced back as a steward of South Sudanese oil. So how did it bounce back? #NTVOntheSpot

1836 2018-06-28 19:57:02 Maybe because when you blend something you put air molecules in it? So it spreads around more in your mouth. Like chewing your wine, you taste it better. Perhaps they're just getting more of the true taste of the oil in their mouth.

1842 2018-06-28 19:56:29 In a sane country those that died in that tanker explosion will have their families compensated. 

Even in poor countries like Pakistan. 

It happen and families were compensated by the government but this is Nigeria oil Money is for them alone.

1851 2018-06-28 19:55:20 Oil companies are interested in money though and if they're smart, they'll see the direction of travel. Oil is becoming increasingly expensive to extract while renewable infrastructure is becoming cheaper. British Petroleum, if smart, will be rebranding as British Power.

1853 2018-06-28 19:55:00 Coconut oil is an excellent massage oil for your skin and may be used as an effective moisturizer for all skin types. It may be massaged into the skin each night before bed to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and to reduce premature aging.

1856 2018-06-28 19:54:52 Fear is what Republicans use to keep the masses in line. Logic is useless. One example is the EPA making it too hard for businesses to make money therefore we must care about oil more than oceans. Thank you Jess for your help trying to make the world a better place
1857 2018-06-28 19:54:35 ... and what Brian Mulroney did in the 80s has as much to do with today's Conservative Party as oil and water. That point was pretty obvious, but maybe not to everyone who retweets Fox News.

1866 2018-06-28 19:53:07 India told US in clearly term that it wont compromise on their energy need. Only way India will accept is US supplying India oil in that price.
1867 2018-06-28 19:53:07 Don't know how blending would affect the oil more than what it took to extract it in the first place. And bitter is evidence of antioxidants/polyphenols. Those don't increase by blending. So glad you busted the myth! 2/2
1868 2018-06-28 19:53:00 The Oil That Is Supposed To Be A Blessing To Us Is Really Nothing But A Curse.

1870 2018-06-28 19:52:47 What fallacies? Would their economy be better off if it merely stayed in the hands of those who maintained the oil monopoly but instead of giving to the poor maintained for the rich? You are DELUSIONAL if you think the right wing would not have been just as overdependent on oil.
1871 2018-06-28 19:52:43 Recovery on the back of oil and gas is not sustainable, but of course still helps. What is the government doing to remove reliance on oil and gas revenues? Like a sales tax for example.

1879 2018-06-28 19:52:02 The ones against alternative practitioners are doctors. Who, btw, are not making a lot of money compared to pharmaceutical companies. And the reason doctors and nurses are against those is because they practice without evidence. They sell snake oil at astronomical prices.
1880 2018-06-28 19:51:59 I've never heard that about olive oil and can't think of a reason chemically why it might be true (other than the garlic thing). Have you seen olive oil being made? The crushing of the olives and extraction of the oil? Super intense. 1/2
1881 2018-06-28 19:51:58 Yeah it's almost like halting all of your production and focusing on exporting crude oil instead is a really stupid idea, and not anything to do with socialism but go off

1929 2018-06-28 19:47:16 Hmmmm. We offend our leaders who cannot enforce the standard and our oil dealers who want to make profit at all cost by abandoning 33k tanker for 50k tanker. So sad!!!
1930 2018-06-28 19:47:07 Clear oil = good and dark oil = bad
1931 2018-06-28 19:46:40 Correct. They don’t hate the EU. They are orchestrating a Schumpeterian shock to the system from which they can profit, rather than waiting for an external systemic shock like a financial crisis, war or oil embargo.

1936 2018-06-28 19:45:48 I look at money like it's the oil that greases the wheels of society. It's a needed tool. Bitcoin will replace money as that tool basically.
1937 2018-06-28 19:45:46 oil tankers should only be allowed to commute from 11pm-4am, having them out in the middle of all the traffic especially at rush hour makes no damn sense

1941 2018-06-28 19:45:06 Mr. Secretary there is no arrangement better than dividing Iran to its original map by granting Arab, Baloush, Kurds and other nationalisms their indepndecy to ban Iranian from accessing Arabian Gulf coasts & oil & gas resources.

1947 2018-06-28 19:44:16 It’s in Denmark, oil town, cycling is crap though, windy and no hills, and most of the bikes I’ve had have pedal back brakes, make an arse of yourself when you bunny hop
1948 2018-06-28 19:44:12 Yeah, oil was super cheap then.
1949 2018-06-28 19:44:08 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.

1954 2018-06-28 19:43:25 Support #RenewableEnergy however you can folks and put an end to big #oil and its corrupting influence!
1955 2018-06-28 19:43:22 It would be nice to think that oil companies are seeing the writing on the wall and pursuing alternative energy strategies for the future. The alternative is that this is fairly hollow CSR. I hope we see more of the former
1956 2018-06-28 19:43:19 coconut oil is the shit

Not one that tastes like castor oil because someone says it will be good for me.

Hillary screwed herself when her campaign fixed the primary.

1965 2018-06-28 19:42:35  y’all. I just realized why my hair is so dry this week....I was supposed to do the LOC method & forgot the oil 
1966 2018-06-28 19:42:33 Yesterday at Ado roundabout, a mini-truck carrying lost control and ran towards the pavement.

The driver pushed the truck, poured brake oil thru d bonnet and continued his journey.

A policewoman came, took pictures and nothing else.

Imagine somebody standing on d pavement

1969 2018-06-28 19:42:20 Hmm when you actually read the articles it's nowt to do with the "wrong bread" but wheat shortage because the govt decided to stop producing any products and export their oil shared instead

It's almost like the wrong bread argument is in bad faith or something
1970 2018-06-28 19:41:53 I finally figured out what gives me red bumps / allergies on my face  it’s the @NyxCosmetics oil primer  for some reason my skin can’t take it
1971 2018-06-28 19:41:48 Ace. Just a shame it's from an oil Co. So much potential for amazing engineering in renewables & climate solutions...
1972 2018-06-28 19:41:48 My apologies but oil shouldn't be transported at all. Let it stay in the ground.
1973 2018-06-28 19:41:46 Who owns CNN? Ever wonder why CNN and Time are so blatantly pro-islamic?Good chunk of AOL Time Warner is owned by Prince Alwaleed Ibn Talal the Saudi billionaire. A front for Saudi royal family. oil money that is swindled from Armco, and "invested" by the Prince and his co.
1974 2018-06-28 19:41:29 Nooooo! There’s an essential oil blend that works to get rid of ants! This makes my soul hurt! *sends consoling hug*
1975 2018-06-28 19:41:23 This is a result of using tanker to carry 45k to 50k litres of fuel. May God give sense to our leaders and oil dealers.
1976 2018-06-28 19:41:22 marinade chicken breast, coat in olive oil and dust with black pepper, grill, chill, cube and top over romaine/parmesan/dressing/crouton mix
1977 2018-06-28 19:41:08 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
1978 2018-06-28 19:40:55 Pruitt is still swimming around in your swamp. He's a bottom feeder. Get rid of him. Allowing him to remain in his job says very bad things about you, like you're afraid of big oil.
1979 2018-06-28 19:40:44 getting the plug on oil changes bc one of the techs has a crush on you 
1980 2018-06-28 19:40:42 EV charged 100% from coal generation (doesn't happen here) is 4 times cleaner than an equivalent ICE car. You should research fractional distillation and crude oil extraction/transportation, look at the environmental impact!! Then check out the @MyEnergiLTD Zappi.

1984 2018-06-28 19:40:12 That inflation is a direct result of the economic war being waged on Venezuela in addition to their over dependence on oil. I’m not sure how rabid inflation somehow justifies intervention or somehow means that their govt is a dictatorship simply because you don’t agree with it.
1985 2018-06-28 19:40:10 I look at virtual tech(internet, v reality) as layer 2 for today's society. Bitcoin will be the oil that creases this engine going forward.

2023 2018-06-28 19:34:29 Why we still don't have special routes for certain vehicles like oil tankers and container trucks beats one's imagination... I almost forgot this is Nigeria where we don't even have enough good roads... #LivingDangerously

2038 2018-06-28 19:33:05 11.) You know how we stop global warming? Not every family needs 3-4 gas powered vehicles , hence increasing fuel consumption hence more oil production...but i know you don't want your liberties taken away right?
2039 2018-06-28 19:33:04 95% of incessant deaths in Nigeria are actually avoidable. Growing up as a child,i have always experienced annual oil tanker and container accidents,now my kids are experiencing same,hope my grandkids wont! So sad....

2042 2018-06-28 19:32:53 Btw, why do they have to wear those robes at the SOTU? Is there like a need to make sure we know who the judges are?
2043 2018-06-28 19:32:49 you say we need gold sinks because zulrah affected the price of grapes? Imagine telling the mint to produce less money because someone discovered a large amount of oil

2052 2018-06-28 19:32:17 if you've changed the oil every 3 to 5 thousand miles and the transmission fluid every 30 to 50 thousand miles the important stuff is covered
2053 2018-06-28 19:31:57 And the prices are set by OPEC, over in the Middle East. It’s a competition between the Middle Eastern and US oil industries that determine the prices.

2067 2018-06-28 19:29:52 Of course you know that Mr. Buffett now owns Fort Mac, so that nasty tar sands oil has now become great and pipeline takes it via Nebraska. Hillary was up here chastising Canadian companies. Trump has that correct 'Fake News'. Wonder how much Nutley is being paid off.

2087 2018-06-28 19:28:16 Yes! Oil seals moisture
2088 2018-06-28 19:28:14 Putting coconut oil on your eyelashes has to be one of the hardest tasks ever... like yeah I want soft healthy lashes but I’m also not tryna lose my sight
2089 2018-06-28 19:28:13 I bet the cutting oil is what did me in.
2090 2018-06-28 19:28:13 Mix in coconut oil with their food.
2091 2018-06-28 19:28:09 Baby oil wit your lotion will have your skin softer than a babies booty .
2092 2018-06-28 19:28:09 I just accidently hit my oil diffuser with my foot and it made a little beep noise and now I feel bad
2093 2018-06-28 19:28:03 It's actually so wrong and insensitive of Oil Marketers to transport their products during business time, especially when there are many commuters using the road. #Lagos #MagodoExplosion @__perez94 @theDamorela @Adavizealao
2094 2018-06-28 19:27:58 .I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure that @fitbathatba did a skit years ago where one of them pretended to be Januzaj dressed as a red crab saying "I don't like Japan" 

If so that's their simpson's moment

(way before blue tick @jj_bull & @JackWaterston became an oil tycoon)

2097 2018-06-28 19:27:52 This might have something to do with the fact @RachelNotley has transformed from a climate champion to some kind of oil executive.
2098 2018-06-28 19:27:51 shoutout to @tulla721 for dumping lavender oil on my hands when I was stressed I still use it and it really.....diffuses a situation.
2099 2018-06-28 19:27:43 Oh, no!! That looks so terrible. There must be a lot of casualties! Why are so many of these disasters linked to OIL?
2100 2018-06-28 19:27:42 Coal is dead, oil to follow to some degree. Clean energy solutions are where it is at.
2101 2018-06-28 19:27:35 Getting oil changes irritates me  & they’re so expensive.
2102 2018-06-28 19:27:30 Original tweet gone but clearly about the BP acquisition. I reckon so. The 'oil' companies are trying to reposition as 'energy' companies. They see EVs coming.. and will want to make it pay commercially...
2103 2018-06-28 19:27:13 I did unfortunately, although I’m trying to season paneer cheese with a little basil and oil to get a true Cypriot taste!
2104 2018-06-28 19:27:12 How much fish oil? People fish oil or pet fish oil? Thanks for the tip, my guy sheds like crazy
2105 2018-06-28 19:27:06 9.) So are we just suppose to depend on oil from other countries to satisfy our greed? We are 2nd in the world in oil production but we consume 3 times as much... how do we fix that?
2106 2018-06-28 19:26:51  Grenada and I want them to try Oil Down lol 
2107 2018-06-28 19:26:45 Or Maxine Waters
2108 2018-06-28 19:26:37 I got tea tree oil in my eye and I think I accidentally ingested some too. RIP to me.

2110 2018-06-28 19:26:30 I've heard of olive oil cakes...and sour cream in cakes... (Seriously do not like raisins!)
2111 2018-06-28 19:26:25 A company must be held accountable. Those transferring the oil must be held accountable. The owners of the tankers must be held accountable. You cannot be taking a poorly maintained transportation vehicle on federal road and causing havoc. You must be held accountable.
2112 2018-06-28 19:26:21 Egg muffins.  Just whisk eggs in a bowl with seasoning and maybe a little butter or olive oil.  In muffin tins place onions, cheese, tomatoes, or whatever you like in a omelet.  Pour eggs over top.  Add a little more cheese for moister and bake at 400 till eggs are done.
2113 2018-06-28 19:26:15 Not much tbh, I vape cbd oil so I buy a big bottle to last me a while and just buy some juice now and again for flavour
2114 2018-06-28 19:26:10 I have to just appreciate this commitment. The Sea never dry, Forte Oil never will
2115 2018-06-28 19:26:06 great, Puteri Afrina. you are brilliant. you left your cleansing oil at your freaking college!!!
2116 2018-06-28 19:26:00 Lemon juice, dill, garlic olive oil, italian/Greek seasoning, salt, pepper.
Marinate for several hours.

Grill to deliciousness.

Only ever buy boneless, skinless thighs
2117 2018-06-28 19:25:54 With 45 years remaining to the end of oil  production how will these people fleeing terror and war travel around Canada in the perceivable future?
2118 2018-06-28 19:25:42 Which oil/gas company has the tanker? Can we hold them accountable for this? What can be done? This Nigeria is a zoo like Nnamdi Kanu said.

2121 2018-06-28 19:25:10 I'm sure the oil companies that will end up with the money will be very grateful for it.
2122 2018-06-28 19:24:53 As for ‘carb overload’, there has also been promotion of dairy foods, olive oil, nuts and ‘protein’ as healthy or nutritionally necessary. Some ppl become o’w over eating those foods while moderating or keeping carbs low. Indivs differ.

2124 2018-06-28 19:24:39 More #FakeNews 
With tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors illegally entering and child trafficking these stories are multidimensional. 
I doubt babies being tried in court alone.
2125 2018-06-28 19:24:14 It’s hard to get off of oil when the expectations is to take a horribly poor country and in less than 20 years (Chavez election to today) turn it all around. Dirt poor to successful doesn’t happen that fast in a country of 31 million people when you convert to ANY other system
2126 2018-06-28 19:24:13 Especially when yuh leave that plantain to ripe. Slice it in some good sizes, not to thin, not too thick. Bathe it in some cinnamon and gently place it in that hot oil.
2127 2018-06-28 19:23:44 Shemen Kaneh Bosem in hebrew anointoing oil made with cannabis
2128 2018-06-28 19:23:41 That, too, but these oil companies will still try to survive by centralizing energy in the same way that they do with petrol/diesel. They want to control the distribution of energy. Of course, in parallel, consumers (homes) and business will be local energy producers/consumers.
2129 2018-06-28 19:23:40 Oh Allah Nigeria. Heartbreaking. 

Oil tankers should really move only at night. I’m always unsettled when I’m by a tank in traffic. May Allah rest their souls
2130 2018-06-28 19:23:38 I'm over today. Just got drenched in hydraulic oil. I need a fatty when I get home.
2131 2018-06-28 19:23:32 Dragon soaps! Either hemp oil or goats milk and pure essential oil blends Channeled by Faeries! Made with love to be used! Only $12
2132 2018-06-28 19:23:28 Hahaha I came to get my oil changed but instead they inspected my car? So of course I had to tell them And now they’re changing the oil and I’m so confused like y hahahaha.
2133 2018-06-28 19:23:27 Had terrible brain zaps coming off zoloft (sertraline) slowly, they’re horrible - it was the worst withdrawal symptom. CBD oil helped if you’re in a state that’s okay with that.
2134 2018-06-28 19:23:24 Couldn't the oil trade him this season, trade for him back at the end of the season and buy him out? Get a team to the floor and then pay it out. Might make the return more reasonable on a trade.
2135 2018-06-28 19:23:16 Argan Oil is packed full of repairing and nurturing antioxidants for glowing skin! It’s in our #FrankincenseIntense Eye Cream!
2136 2018-06-28 19:23:04 It’s sad that some people really think we went to war over fucking oil when we drill our own oil here in America
2137 2018-06-28 19:23:03 I hate that oil changes gotta be either inconvenient and overbearing or expensive
2138 2018-06-28 19:22:52 Pro tip: SHAVE UR LEGS WITH BABY OIL never had my legs feel this smooth
2139 2018-06-28 19:22:48 Fuck this country men, we don't even die of legitimate reasons.
In 2018, my oil producing country does not have a train system to move our fuel around.

Okay don't vote Buhari, who is the option. We are so fucked as a country.
2140 2018-06-28 19:22:48 #WallStreet Oil jumps on the day at one point trading at $74 a barrel , while price at the pump holds steady for now
2141 2018-06-28 19:22:33 The GDP thing to me is kind of a silly thing. Socialist countries will always have swings in GDP because that is not a great descriptor of their system. Oil is 95% of exports? Fine. Not a huge deal as they grow UNTIL OPEC ramps production as further punishment.
2142 2018-06-28 19:22:31 I messed up when stretching my ears. There sore, painful, and bleeding. I've been cleaning and soaking them in saltwater and massaging them with Vitamin E oil.

2146 2018-06-28 19:22:17 I refuse to acknowledge this thing as human.  Not because it identifies as  transgender, because it's a traitor and should be rotting in Ft.Leavenworth.

It should be held in the same light as other traitors such as Benedict Arnold.

2148 2018-06-28 19:22:04 Leave for 1 pinch of oil and dice the chicken in the bag.
2149 2018-06-28 19:21:55 Idk but using a lubricant while jacking off makes me explode and shoot cum unusually fucking stronger uggh (i prefer lotion than baby oil though) haha #jakol #altermanila #teen #exploringteen
2150 2018-06-28 19:21:51 you just gotta make ur own mayo, it's so easy, put eggs and oil in a blender, or use vinegar instead
2151 2018-06-28 19:21:36 I feel like ever since I got my oil changed my gas burning fast af or sumn
2152 2018-06-28 19:21:29 REALLY one has to wonder what  Nigeria’s oil industry has delivered vis-a-vis the revenues that we are actually able to realize and invest for human development. #OtedolaBridge WHY are fuel tankers on the road during rush hour? Why are tanker drivers & associations above the law?

2155 2018-06-28 19:21:16 We've gotten to that point where oil tankers (loaded or unloaded) and trailers should stop moving during the day. Really. These things can't keep happening this way. NO. This is heart wrenching! 
2156 2018-06-28 19:21:12 The antiquated EC should have been abolished after the civil war . Until 2000 there hadn’t been a need to re-evaluate but then we were distracted with 9/11 and wars . Which Is why they stole 2000 and then 2016 . It’s about oil !
2157 2018-06-28 19:21:05 I would say rest in peace, but I don't think you'd want that. Farewell, Harlan Ellison, and in your honor, a quote I read from you and remembered: “Be uncomfortable; be sand, not oil, to the machinery of the world.”― Günter Eich

2160 2018-06-28 19:20:47 On Tuesday, the U.S. demanded that all countries halt imports of Iranian crude from early November. The Trump administration’s position comes as part of a broader push to further isolate Tehran both politically and economically. Where does South Africa buy its oil?

That being said our lesson grass oil is the bomb
2162 2018-06-28 19:20:31 It’s the best engine. It can be started with a finger. Self lubricating. Takes any size piston and changes it’s own oil every month. The management system is so temperamental tho

2164 2018-06-28 19:20:26 I made it as scientifically as possible... same oil, leaves from the same plant, cloves from the same garlic, same cheese, everything measured - only way that I could be sure that the oil was the one to be blamed. Oh, did it on a high speed blender.
2165 2018-06-28 19:20:05 I just drive a pressure truck, that's pretty "close to the oil". Company I'm with got trashed by the glut and we were lucky. Service rigs got it much worse and drilling rigs were wiped out.

2177 2018-06-28 19:18:46 This pipeline is bigger and even more dangerous than DAPL. Our sacred water in northern Minnesota is being threatened by tar sands. The filthiest oil

2189 2018-06-28 19:18:01 And looking at the way the oil price is shooting up, another increase after this one is eminent
2190 2018-06-28 19:17:55 We're hovering around it. Lots of lip service, but still ignoring indigenous needs and capitulating to oil and resource industries. Understandably, though because we're a materials economy, but we could listen to the people more.
2191 2018-06-28 19:17:51 Repealed anti-bribery rule to the delight of the oil industry.

2194 2018-06-28 19:17:37 And this might explain why Trump’s been aggressively looking for money by making spending cuts, tapping on new revenues (from coal, gas, oil) & trying to increase exports (by lowering foreign tariffs) and domestic production with a view to improve a domestic tax base.
2195 2018-06-28 19:17:31 This is wrong jaribuni kupitia upya...Mafuta yatokanayo na wanyama..its fat in nature and solid at room temperature (25°)

2224 2018-06-28 19:14:10 @cnn You keep bringing on snake oil salesmen and traitors, then allow them to own the conversation.  Bye Felicia..
2225 2018-06-28 19:14:04 I’m so heated I lost my little ass hair oil that costed me 30$ 
2226 2018-06-28 19:14:00  Lemon-Garlic Salmon Linguini
Al dente linguini tossed in a simple yet bright lemon-garlic infused olive oil with a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, topped with a tender grilled salmon filet.
2227 2018-06-28 19:13:56 Richest oil reserves in the Western Hemisphere. Ruined in 20 years @pghDSA
2228 2018-06-28 19:13:52 Amidst US-China Trade war Rupee slumps to its lowest after 2016,Crude oil prices keeping it's volatility maintained will affect CAD. Iran oil import sanction at the behest of US further deprive the Situation, Amid Controversy of N Korea still languishing on its Nuclear Reactors.
2229 2018-06-28 19:13:50 My wheel house is Oil and Gas- but my Buddy just mentioned $TMDI- just listed on the NAS- worth a look . Low float
2230 2018-06-28 19:13:45 I'm inclined to agree. But they are beyond amazing roasted with a little garlic and olive oil. #SummerSpuds
2231 2018-06-28 19:13:42 Esa era el superdolar tuyo? 95? El mismo nivel de Diciembre 2017? Eso no es superdolar... eso fue un squeeze de la posicion short masiva. It's over. Los EM son una oportunidad tan interesante como el Oil a $26. No te quedes mirando pal Cielo otra vez
2232 2018-06-28 19:13:31 For cleansers, I usually get Ole Henrikson foam cleanser. I also use an oil cleanser from Boscia to help get my makeup off, then use the foam cleanser. All from Sephora. Acne dots from Corsx on amazon/ulta beauty. Also the aztec mud mask on amazon. Once a week.
2233 2018-06-28 19:13:23 Now for those of you who aren’t already @maybelline experts, here’s a fun fact - #ShineCompulsion is Maybelline’s first oil-in-lipstick! #contest
2234 2018-06-28 19:13:16 I’m obsessed with lemon essential oil! I use it to clean the floors, I put it in the toilet, I use it in my diffuser, I could go on.
2235 2018-06-28 19:13:11 Olaplex!!!! And pure Argan oil!!!
2236 2018-06-28 19:13:07 ヌルッとお見通しだ！
2237 2018-06-28 19:12:58 . Try primrose evening oil. It's supposed to help with the symptoms. I got the prescription after raising hell at work lol
2238 2018-06-28 19:12:57 Can somebody inform the fuckwit @Operation m box cic @OperationMorale that cannabis oil is totally legal. Sorry to disappoint him
2239 2018-06-28 19:12:31 I don’t need to look up Aramco. U spouted the old trope of “war for oil”. And called the US “occupiers”. IF you’re talking point is true, what is OPEC selling? NOBODY in the Middle East could stop us from occupying AND taking all their oil. #QuitBeingLazy
2240 2018-06-28 19:12:26 Do yo still have baby oil from last time? Or did we use it all? I can buy some more, LMK
2241 2018-06-28 19:12:23 Freshly wax/shave & baby oil on my skin.  amazing feeling. 
2242 2018-06-28 19:12:20 What's the difference between an NY Times reporter and a handful of old stale oil?
2243 2018-06-28 19:12:19 Salmon oil too I’ve been told 
2244 2018-06-28 19:12:14 I go in for an oil change and I leave with an estimate for $800 worth of work like bruh.. I JUST got paid
2245 2018-06-28 19:12:14 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2246 2018-06-28 19:12:11 You list your conflicts first: emoluments clause, taking foreign money for campaigns, money laundering for Russians, personal deals in Russian oil profits, trump trademark deals in foreign lands, bribery, graft, charitable foundation FRAUD. The list is endless.
2247 2018-06-28 19:12:10 I think imma try some castor oil
2248 2018-06-28 19:12:08 If pasted, the old pipeline should declared an environmental/health hazard and be removed by new pipeline contractor/oil company asap! There must be responsibility for the people.  Good stewardship is essential ...Clean up our messes!
2249 2018-06-28 19:12:04 The oil of joy will never cease in your life....  God blessings will forever remain with you
2250 2018-06-28 19:11:52 much cheaper than bombing other countries for their oil.
2251 2018-06-28 19:11:50 I mean... perhaps proces over food transport, public transport, energy generation... perharps, just perhaps might be.... say... affected... by gas and oil prices... y mean.. probably... i don't knnow what harvard' tales says about that....
2252 2018-06-28 19:11:35 I use my guns to protect myself and my children.  I suppose you would think it is sexier for me to be raped and my children murdered?
2253 2018-06-28 19:11:32 Judiciary Hearing When @RepGoodlatte answered the question for the dems to be included on the hearings and committee's you all essentially as usual got blown off..Apparent as the nose on his face..Treason snake oil..from the Freedom Caucus as usual..what freedom?
2254 2018-06-28 19:11:27 Was it a forte oil tanker?
2255 2018-06-28 19:11:23 I’m an oil and gas engineer. Nowt is made or fabricated in the uk .
2256 2018-06-28 19:11:23 Worlds largest oil reserves are just coincidence im sure. And the same US that cages children at the border cares deeply about the Venezuelan people....
2257 2018-06-28 19:11:22 this expensive ass oil change 
2258 2018-06-28 19:11:10 EVs need equal subsidies to be competitive. When govt is willing to end oil subsidies then I’ll be first to call for an end to EV subsidies as well
2259 2018-06-28 19:11:08 Line 3 oil pipeline sounds like it’s a go in Minnesota!!! 

A HUGE Win!!!

2261 2018-06-28 19:10:57 I think Trump is just another globalist in disguise. It started with the "mexican thing" about the wall, continued with the native Americans over the oil pipelines. It went on to putting random muslim countries on block lists, but not the countries that matter, like Saudi Arabia.
2262 2018-06-28 19:10:42 I just had chicken fried in 100% grape seed oil. It’s super healthy & the oil is light. I drizzled it on pasta too.
2263 2018-06-28 19:10:39 Just complete disbelief that this sun lotion is in oil form
2264 2018-06-28 19:10:37 Should countries work towards changing #USA led world order?When US wants to develop its #oil,#LNG industry imposes sanctions on #IRAN,#Russia.Wants to sell #arms imposes sanctions on Russia or attacks a country like #Syria,#Libya.Wants to stop #tech advancement,#sanctions #China
2265 2018-06-28 19:10:36 Thanks for sharing @sugarpuffish - how do you like the @Lyonsleaf oil? Fell in love with their balm last week and kinda regretting my purchase of a different facial oil today 
2266 2018-06-28 19:10:34 Peak oil! Drink! #WGC2018
2267 2018-06-28 19:10:26 God punish Nigeria senators. They want to pass a bill to regulate social media but Nigerians are being killed everyday. Some mins ago, many people lost their lives at otedola bridge ard Berger. No bill to regulate the movement of oil tankers. #OilTankersShouldMoveAtMidnight
2268 2018-06-28 19:10:24 咎さんも猫苦手なのか…
2269 2018-06-28 19:10:17 I like to cut a cross in them, bring them to boil. Then drizzle with olive oil, add a pinch of celery salt and garnish with fresh parsley  #SummerSpuds
2270 2018-06-28 19:10:15 Who tryna kick it for a bit after this oil change? Lol

2272 2018-06-28 19:10:05 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
2273 2018-06-28 19:09:47 Finally getting a oil change after 7 months 
2274 2018-06-28 19:09:43 So why will I follow you? Just to be watching
2275 2018-06-28 19:09:22 One of your staff sold me on the sandalwood beard oil and I can’t stop using more than the recommended amount. No regrets.
2276 2018-06-28 19:09:20 Could be. Also, let’s define bitter. Do we mean traditional bitter flavor, or is it that spicy thing in the back of the throat that olive oil can have that we’re talking about? I’ve assumed true bitterness (though I still haven’t noticed much difference in my tastings either way)
2277 2018-06-28 19:09:18 Except people living on #Burnaby Mountain. Those people can die in a fire if something goes wrong at the dangerous #KinderMorgan oil tank farm. Am I right, Justin? Oh wait that's YOUR tank farm now. You should fix it.
2278 2018-06-28 19:09:17 i told aric last night to get VEGETABLE oil and he’s like ok. He comes home with CORN oil and when i asked him why he didn’t get the vegetable oil .. this goes     “ corn is a vegetable so it’s the same thing” .....B O Y okay
2279 2018-06-28 19:09:00 I’ve seen people put coconut oil in dogs food to help their coat
2280 2018-06-28 19:08:55 What was the crude oil price during UPA and what's the price now/ few months back? What's the petrol price then and now?
2281 2018-06-28 19:08:45 I’m just trying to get my oil changed and there’s 3 small children in the waiting area someone save me plz
2282 2018-06-28 19:08:39 So we’re taking all the middle eastern oil?
You should email opec. They’re unaware. #LazyThinker
2283 2018-06-28 19:08:28 Transphobic Dems!!!
2284 2018-06-28 19:08:24 My mom texts like college athletes tweet:

Good morning  beautiful. Hope you have a wonderful day at work  When you get oil changed in the car , have them use full synthetic plz  Love you. 
2285 2018-06-28 19:08:22 I like the “The Raft” with that big oil slick looking thing. The best part is when that guy starts feeling up that girl with the awesome tits and then it gets through the cracks  of the raft and starts melting her face
2286 2018-06-28 19:08:22 cbd oil.
2287 2018-06-28 19:08:19 When’s ur next free day bb or morning off I wanna sew w u bb I just got books from books Inc so read music tea & chill ;)

2289 2018-06-28 19:08:02 NEWS: @nikkihaley says India needs to "rethink its relationship with Iran" & she had a "constructive conversation" with PM Modi about cutting Iranian oil imports during their meeting.
COMMENT: That's American hectoring. Should India draft its foreign policy as per US wishes?
2290 2018-06-28 19:07:51 My sister, the whole thing is so disheartening. Not to talk of the oil tanker that exploded on a bridge today and killed many people. I'm just tired
2291 2018-06-28 19:07:45 It's only a problem if you make it one.
Must be horrible to live life in such a state of angst and fear in a daily basis.
2292 2018-06-28 19:07:44 I can physically feel the oil seeping out of my pores 
2293 2018-06-28 19:07:34 99% of those oil tankers are owned by our lawmakers or friends of our lawmakers. This is why nothing has been done about them. Nigeria is trash. Nigeria is scum.
2294 2018-06-28 19:07:24 CBD Oil is the solution my guy.
2295 2018-06-28 19:07:24 UK been hit both ways - soft pound and rise in oil price - funny how the government said when fuel goes up they cut the tax to off set the rise and they still to do anything with that election promise
2296 2018-06-28 19:07:23 Tanning oil is a savior
2297 2018-06-28 19:07:17 @Kuntry3d Heya Walter, I sent the PTFE oil! :) Hope you like it.

2299 2018-06-28 19:07:07 This is seeming more and more like a good avenue to explore. I’m not even sure I’m tasting it, but if i am, it’s subtle. Yet you find it glaringly obvious. Is this the asparagus pee of olive oil?
2300 2018-06-28 19:07:06 Make sure you’re eating enough approved vegetables and your water intake is high else you may start to wonder if you’ll ever crap again.  Drinking mineral oil is nooooo picnic

2304 2018-06-28 19:06:38 Some people only want to use high quality cbd oil the one I use as only CBD as a first ingredient then Olive oil and terpenes only 3 ingredients!!! All organic It's very important. I saw people selling colored cbd oil with several flavours... I don't know about that!
2305 2018-06-28 19:06:35 what is; castor oil; for $100?
2306 2018-06-28 19:06:34 @midas, on March 30, 2018 I had $670.00 work done at my local Midas, including an oil change.
2307 2018-06-28 19:06:34 Is @RSPOtweets certified “sustainable” palm oil truly sustainable? If you think labor exploitation is sustainable then yes. #EURT2018
2308 2018-06-28 19:06:32 The oil supercycle was ending. The roller-coaster ride was finished.  NEP was merely coincident.

Remember the made-in-Canada oil price feature of the NEP?  If fully implemented, the NEP would have got our prov/fed economies off  world-oil price dependency. But alas, Ontario
2309 2018-06-28 19:05:39 Wonderful .Turmeric is such a fantastic spice .I use it for ms ,my son for asthma and daughter for her tummy .
An all round amazing alternative or great taken alongside meds.
The fact it is used with coconut oil sounds simply divine .

2310 2018-06-28 19:05:39 Pls. It's not thick with blue smoke, leaking oil and on speed dial to Cowley so, like, no obvs.
2311 2018-06-28 19:05:31 The discovery of oil might be the most terrible thing to happen to nigeria
2312 2018-06-28 19:05:21 My legs don't seem to be getting the memo about us going on the sun bed. They're as white as when I started going on  Even smothering them in oil hasn't worked. #AlbinoProbz
2313 2018-06-28 19:05:20 Sounds really nice. What type of oil?
2314 2018-06-28 19:05:13 Yes and mess with Old Texans oil money and then they really will lose votes because they pay to keep these people in. How inconvenient.
2315 2018-06-28 19:05:01 Right, lots of people who have reported it, but also people who say they’ve never noticed it (not in this thread, but in general, like Nancy Harmon Jenkins in her olive oil book)
2316 2018-06-28 19:05:00 Growth in the oil and gas industry means more revenue for our schools, emergency services and infrastructure! 
2317 2018-06-28 19:04:47 No - but the number of jobs lost can be. Opportunities can be pursued while within the EU but your twaddle is simply unicorn-farming snake oil - come back when you can find work for the people at Airbus and BMW and Nissan and Honda and the countless thousands in the supply chains
2318 2018-06-28 19:04:40 Yeah, an oil tank exploded.
2319 2018-06-28 19:04:37 All boils down to useless government! The tragedy dat will happen at Apapa Tincan is still loading! Oil Tank farms in an area where people live! Trucks and tankers loaded being allowed to stay on top of a bridge whose structural integrity is under question!
2320 2018-06-28 19:04:20 Can’t beat putting them in the halo with salt and cracked pepper with a little oil - I call them my mini jackets #SummerSpuds
2321 2018-06-28 19:04:12 Oil lovers- 
I’ve got something special for you!!!! 
#nomorebuzzingaroundears
2322 2018-06-28 19:04:10 Painful. All these oil tankers and trailers should not be allowed to move during the day. The drivers should be checked always for substance intake. Most of them drink, smoke and take in stuffs before entering the road. Please what are FRSC's duties again?
2323 2018-06-28 19:04:08 I’ve got a Taggiasca oil made by Italian brand Casa Bruna; Frankies 457 Biancolilla; A Spanish oil I picked up at Despaña called Egosum made from arbequina and hojiblanca, and California Olive Company’s everyday oil
2324 2018-06-28 19:04:02 Hard seltzer is the new craft beer... Fuck paying $9 for something that tastes like lamp oil... Hard seltzer is any flavor and its refreshing and it tastes great. Fuck a craft beer
2325 2018-06-28 19:04:01 Im sorry this is a ridiculous concept. You cant dance around any team without confidence. The conspiracy is the cumulative weight of white privilege, poor/racist refereeing, that sucks the creative juice as it does gold and oil and people.
2326 2018-06-28 19:03:52 You need that breathe oil girl !
2327 2018-06-28 19:03:36 That's right.  @danielleperrau4  has won the hair oil:)

Yes batteries (and copper, iron etc) need to be mined ethically as possible, but same goes for all minerals
2332 2018-06-28 19:02:46 What's the price of a loaf of bread now? 
2, 3 million Bolivars?
2333 2018-06-28 19:02:40 CBD oil tastes like asshole when you vape it 
2334 2018-06-28 19:02:37 I use a mix of vinegar, water, and a couple drops of mint essential oil and it def helps. I use the mint to keep the cat from getting too interested in my gear bag. (He already destroyed one with pee)

2340 2018-06-28 19:02:00 Animals can’t evolve fast enough to escape human imposed change. sea otters could be one oil spill from extinction. Ethics for Dominant Species require us to protect other species and their habitats.
2341 2018-06-28 19:01:52 Snake oil.
2342 2018-06-28 19:01:48 Stauffer squashed the rumor. Oil have closed up shop for summer. They’re going to bank on some players bouncing back (Talbot, Lucic, Sekera) and hope some young guys (JP, Yamamoto) take a step. Tough to see them as anything more than bubble playoff team.Certainly not a contender
2343 2018-06-28 19:01:43 If there can be holy water and holy oil why not holy theft, remember there are holy lies too if you know what I mean
2344 2018-06-28 19:01:23 I keep hitting my oil pen like it’s a vape so I’ve been faded all day

2347 2018-06-28 19:01:05 I try not to use canola or other refined oils. I use pressed avocado oil which makes excellent mayo but is quite expensive. It was suggested to me that I try adding some honey to the evoo mayo...
2348 2018-06-28 19:00:58 Isn't the reason the company is struggling though. A lot of airlines couldn't take their moneys out of Nigeria and Angola when oil prices tumbled and dollar shortages hit those economies but didn't fold. Our ordinary citizens have no options, companies do.
2349 2018-06-28 19:00:55 • Double Cleansing
Makeup is oil-based, and everything is so layered that one step of cleansing does not take everything off. Do one minute of face massage with a cleansing oil, and one minute of massage with a foam cleanser. That alone will really help with breakouts.
2350 2018-06-28 19:00:55 It's funny you think your a " numbers guy" but not a word about EV demand elasticity due to oil prices. Don't you think another oil shock will increase EV demand? I do.

2360 2018-06-28 19:00:02 It is common to apply aloe or tea tree oil to skin to treat pimples. But did you know that applying green tea directly to your face can also help reduce inflammation and bacteria that causes acne? Leave it on for 10 minutes or overnight then rinse with water! #beautytips
2361 2018-06-28 18:59:59 So I just popped my 4-evoo blend into my Vitamix, cranked it to high and let it run for about 45 seconds or so. Oil got pretty warm, and tasting, I think maybe there is something there, kind of a metallic quality…though I’ll let it cool down and taste again.
2362 2018-06-28 18:59:59 Its not a parody account. It's the real one. 

U guys should take this things easy. No need for anger. The boss of forte oil is being compassionate. He didn't cause the fire. We all regret this ugly incidence.
2363 2018-06-28 18:59:57 My condolence goes to the families of all those that lost their lives in this lagos tanker inferno ,may Allah give y'all the fortitude to bear this irreparable lost.
2364 2018-06-28 18:59:57 I agree. Especially after last year.AlJazeera is not reliable. There are 9Million Saudi Women who are eligble to drive here. By 2030, they will add $90billion to their country’s economy. They are diversifyig their ways to boost their economy and less dependence on Oil.

2366 2018-06-28 18:59:46 so i can make my car look sexy but if i make my gun look sexy it's tasteless ???

why can't i have my own preferences of what i want to customize and how i want to live my life as a free American ???
2367 2018-06-28 18:59:41 Triggered  
2368 2018-06-28 18:59:40 Big oil companies ripping off Canadians! Costco in Abbotsford was 1.349 yesterday, lowest price in the Fraser Valley!  Of course, just cross the US  border for 1.15 gas. Worth the trip, particularly if you pick up half priced dairy,  chickens, eggs, etc!
2369 2018-06-28 18:59:37 Good.....they bought the snake oil....let them feel the burn going down!
2370 2018-06-28 18:58:57 If you use a flea comb again on them, put oil on the comb because the fleas just move away or jump off and you wouldn’t see them easily they are so fast  so anything to make them stick to the comb that is edible to the cats in case there’s residue left in their fur :o
2371 2018-06-28 18:58:51 He should go to Wal-Mart or Target and look for this cream/oil that helps fill in the sides better
2372 2018-06-28 18:58:46 It is so bizarre to watch fb friends fall prey to VERY EXPENSIVE PLACEBO EFFECT SNAKE OIL PYRAMID SCHEMES FROM A WILDLY ILL-REPUTED COMPANY because I'm always like "HOW can you not see what I see??????"

2374 2018-06-28 18:58:37 Arnie, in the UK many people are still using coal to heat their homes because they can’t afford the prohibitive gas, oil & electricity costs. The government let the power companies increase prices at will, so what are we meant to do???
2375 2018-06-28 18:58:35 I use ginger candy & apply pressure to my wrist. There’s a pressure point in there that will help with nausea. I also use lavender oil to ease my stress.
2376 2018-06-28 18:58:34 Should we also compare crude oil price?
2377 2018-06-28 18:58:30 Not enough oil. A pan pizza is basically deep-fried in a deeper pan.
2378 2018-06-28 18:58:25 You don’t see the term “snake oil” in enough tweets. Well done.
2379 2018-06-28 18:58:21 Was it a Forte Oil tanker??!
2380 2018-06-28 18:58:19 You need CBD to balance you out and negate the overstimulation of THC. A 1:1 ratio oil, edible, or sublingual should help and stick with indica dominant hybrids for flower and you should be fine once you build a bit of a tolerance. 

Happy smoking big guy.
2381 2018-06-28 18:58:16 I am in Missouri so we are probably a long way away from legalization medicinal or recreational, but its nice to at least have this.  I know the other stuff works but the cbd oil is legal here and allows me to function normally 
2382 2018-06-28 18:58:09 Castor oil
2383 2018-06-28 18:58:04 Right so which one do you believe. Usually gasoline leads oil I thought. So if gasoline doesn't follow now what?
2384 2018-06-28 18:58:03 Before people could blame Ramaphosa & the ANC for petrol increases, a determination must be made as where is this petrol coming from and the resources. For instance, do we have any resevior of refined oil in South Africa or where are we buying it from and for how much?
2385 2018-06-28 18:57:49 T But that doesn't mean greedy oil speculator should drive the oil price up and hurt USA Main Street workers and businesses with High Gas !. USA is awash in oil ! Keep our Gas  $ low
2386 2018-06-28 18:57:39 Quick, someone shake her!!!  I dont think shes breathing.
2387 2018-06-28 18:57:38 This is the bridge across magodo phase 2 before you get to Berger adjacent to japaul house.
Close to the digital bill board.
Before you get to capital oil.
2388 2018-06-28 18:57:16 Finish with olive oil and Maldon salt. It’s incredible !
2389 2018-06-28 18:57:06 I use either extra virgin olive oil or cold pressed rapeseed oil. I have heard that 50:50 olive and rapeseed is a great way of getting some of the acidity of olive oil with the mellowness of rapeseed.
2390 2018-06-28 18:56:46 Just do a deep conditioner & try your best to stay away from straightening/curling your hair.

I did a diy hair mask & it made my curls soft & pretty! Used 1 egg, mayo, honey, & coconut oil.
2391 2018-06-28 18:56:45 God is very angry with Nigerians. Please get your PVC and vote this incompetent leaders out. The country is dying. We have no security and no laws. Why are these tankers allowed to move up and down with no restrictions? In the UK these oil tankers can only move at night. #otedola
2392 2018-06-28 18:56:42 ANALYSIS:Saudi-Russian axis rules oil markets as Trump fights Iran
2393 2018-06-28 18:56:41 The big thing is that they're fried in the same oil as meat products, same way you can't say something is peanut free if it's in a facility that also handles peanuts. They've been using canola oil for ages now, it's just a matter of sharing the friers.
2394 2018-06-28 18:56:40 Forte oil. The CEO has put out a statement.
2395 2018-06-28 18:56:34 Give me oil in my lamp, keep me burning...  (whistling it right now)
2396 2018-06-28 18:55:58 A friend of mine was once bringing two bottles of olive oil back from holiday and she discovered at baggage reclaim that they'd both broken #unlucky #ukwinehour
2397 2018-06-28 18:55:52 ...re-establish the US as a respectable world leader rather than undo generations of diplomatic work before him, reverse his undoing of the environmental protections Obama afforded to prevent another Gulf oil spill from occurring, protect coal miners from unhealthy conditions...
2398 2018-06-28 18:55:47 The scrap part came off the fixture much too easily. I think the cutting oil seeped underneath and made the tape let go. Doh!
2399 2018-06-28 18:55:23 Is this oil or water color? Need to know before I make my decision
2400 2018-06-28 18:55:21 Daniel: just remembered that I also tested starting with canola for the emulsion then adding olive oil by hand and it’s significantly less bitter than if you add the exact same amount of evoo to the hand blender jar when making the mayo. This rules out garlic as the sole culprit.
2401 2018-06-28 18:55:00 The job seemed simple enough: oil up the abs, make a little cash. Instead, reality TV burnout-turned-exotic dancer Russ “Studicus” Chambers ends up in ancient Rome, where he’ll have to save Julius Caesar through the power of pole dancing & 80s rock #SF #FA #TT #SFFpit
2402 2018-06-28 18:54:50 Let them when they can't afford Oil other wise let's see what they do..
2403 2018-06-28 18:54:41 the Chrissy Teigen body oil looks so freakin bomb 
2404 2018-06-28 18:54:39 I just watched a tutorial on how to check oil
2405 2018-06-28 18:54:25 Trump is lining up extra production to offset Iranian oil with Saudi, Russia, UAE, Iraq deal. Other producers are under pressure to do the same.
2406 2018-06-28 18:54:24 I use Epsom salts / Oilatum bath and tea tree oil.
2407 2018-06-28 18:54:10 Aku pake sampo herbal essence yg pink + conditioner (ini bebas sih menurutku mau pake merk apa aja, tp so far yg oke tuh pantene 3 mins miracle sama makarizo) + loreal extraordinary oil pas rambut masih basah2 gitu (aku pakenya agak bangak btw) abis itu aku biasanya lanjut pake
2408 2018-06-28 18:54:05 That's not mentioning the bottles of oil and vinegar #ukwinehour
2409 2018-06-28 18:53:59 Went to get my oil changed and when I was paying the guy said when I came in my oil was low. I’m glad we cleared up the reason I came.
2410 2018-06-28 18:53:29 Sexillency you have spoken well
2411 2018-06-28 18:53:26 Don’t add the olive oil from be start. Use canola oil to make the emulsion the transfer to a bowl and whisk in olive oil by hand to finish. Not really a way to do it with 100% oil with the immersion blender.
2412 2018-06-28 18:53:04 If a taco shop also offers oil changes, or new tires, it is guaranteed to be a good taco shop
2413 2018-06-28 18:52:59 I bought coconut oil for like $8 at Walmart. Put a warm damp towel on your face to open your pores rub in the coconut oil and then I wash it off with the clean and clear deep action face wash. Works like a charm.
2414 2018-06-28 18:52:48 Like a war for oil when we have free sun....
2415 2018-06-28 18:52:43 On the highway blasting “All I Do” by B5.. AC on cool on my way to get an oil change and tires aligned. Shit you can do when you got your own 
2416 2018-06-28 18:52:17 Blame the rise in global oil prices which are directly proportional to fuel prices btw. So yeah. This has nothing to do with Ramaphosa.
2417 2018-06-28 18:52:00 And, if lavender doesn’t bother you, if ya do get a burn it will help take the sting out! And lessen ur peeling. Just don’t let the kitties near it bc they don’t handle that essential oil well.

2419 2018-06-28 18:51:53 In family life, love is the oil that eases friction, the cement that binds closer together, and the prayer that brings peace & harmony.
2420 2018-06-28 18:51:50 Don't they get enough oil from places where they don't disrupt the environment. What are they trying to do make all the animals on the Earth extinct one place at a time, to fill their greedy Pockets with money.
2421 2018-06-28 18:51:48 Many legal things (refined sugar, trans fat, vegetable oil, not exercising/laziness, Tylenol, cigarettes/nicotine, alcohol etc) are much more toxic than most illegal drugs. 
Also, the vast majority of ppl in jail are nonviolent drug offenders, which is a huge drain on resources.
2422 2018-06-28 18:51:45 Been using olive oil. Probably explains why it was a bit acidic..
2423 2018-06-28 18:51:40 Chelsea never should have run. Needs 2 get own act together B4 deciding what's best 4 rest of us. That's true of many pol's who did win but I never encouraged them.
2424 2018-06-28 18:51:38 Done, thanks it was on the Ethiopian crude oil extraction.
2425 2018-06-28 18:51:35 Putin is meeting Trump in Finland to try and get sanctions removed so he can sell Russian oil.  That's worth billions and he's going to offer Comrade Trump a piece of the action.  Putin's winning.
2426 2018-06-28 18:51:27 "At least they stuck you in water and not oil. That's a plus at least."
2427 2018-06-28 18:51:25 Y subira el gas oil...siempre mirando por el beneficio del obrero..
2428 2018-06-28 18:51:16 Son, you’ve bought some snake oil.  

You seem very naïve, it looks like more than smidgen of it too.
2429 2018-06-28 18:51:12 I hope they had like, olive oil or something
2430 2018-06-28 18:51:10 I put oil on my curly hair because someone told me this won’t make it as frizzy but it’s straighter I DONT LIKE WHAT’S HAPPENING
2431 2018-06-28 18:50:58 @jvn my hair is so fine and thin that a stylist for a wedding once said "oh...hunny..." Do your normal hair recc's of She Uemura cleansing oil etc work for my sad hair?! I'm dying to find my white buffalo... #thinhair #flatness #finerealness
2432 2018-06-28 18:50:53 Im like @DawnDish vs oil spills & messy dinner guests plates.  Cleaning up other people's screw ups and messes is apparently what I do now.
2433 2018-06-28 18:50:48 @Take5_OilChange thank you for oil change at new location in Memphis TN. Will spread the word!
2434 2018-06-28 18:50:40 Modiji should take good advices on the threatening of USA to not to import oil from Iran, and not to bow down to USA
2435 2018-06-28 18:50:31 Sounds like you are a Oil share holder. Very bad for EV drivers.
2436 2018-06-28 18:50:28 Work on an offshore oil rig in the command center. Big big money.
2437 2018-06-28 18:50:28 Dear Mr President @NAkufoAddo 
Tema Oil Refinery (TOR) has been shut down about a week now over flimsy excuses. 
I know you are in hurry and this would be resolved as early as possible. 
We cant have those oil fields in our country and TOR wouldn't get crude oil. #GhanaBeyondAid
2438 2018-06-28 18:50:15 Well we don't have a nanny to wipe the bottoms of our children, so we're not worthy of his concern and consideration but at least he pretends to care whilst his investment snake oil business moves to Dublin.
Happy days!
2439 2018-06-28 18:50:08 Same!! I havent tried the castor oil yet 
2440 2018-06-28 18:49:59 *lactates motor oil*
2441 2018-06-28 18:49:55 Hello Mr. Schachter, you’re a smart guy and I’m always interested in your thoughts, however, I've noted your predictions for lower oil over the last 10-11 months of which all were not realized?? Not to mention that big thick binder you reference when fielding questions??
2442 2018-06-28 18:49:50 Jeez how about you start boiling the oil, dig a moat, and unleash the hounds while you're at it.
2443 2018-06-28 18:49:50 right? I was amazed at how similar it can be sometimes. I don't paint much in oil, but acrylics are also kinda similar sometimes.
2444 2018-06-28 18:49:46 how does drilling for oil make us safe again???
2445 2018-06-28 18:49:46 $CEI glad I sold. Thank you oil god! Folks I am praying to data God tonight for $INPX (next week run) GL enjoy I am hit up hiking with $$$
2446 2018-06-28 18:49:33 This evening's recipes from #LincolnshireKitchen on @BBCRadioLincs 

Mushrooms in Parsley Sauce

For the tapas
Dash olive or rapeseed oil
6 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
Half a red chilli pepper, finely sliced
500g roughly of button mushrooms – halved where large
1 tbsp flour
2447 2018-06-28 18:49:33 Lets not forget the oil they sell us (which is meant to be meat, which is also watery, yuk!)
2448 2018-06-28 18:49:29 My sisters have a whole ass brother and still pay 70 bucks for an oil change smh
2449 2018-06-28 18:49:28 Gf lunch  oil change & tire rotation  manicure  finally tanned  skydive scheduled  now grocery store and benefit for Janey & I will have had a good and productive day! Feels good to feel good again 
2450 2018-06-28 18:49:23 Hash browns have no place on a  breakfast, or any other meal. Undercooked potato and raw onion fried until soaked in oil? Yak!
2451 2018-06-28 18:49:22 @ChickenLickenSA your contact form on your website won't submit – i would like to know if you use palm oil or palm oil/kernel/fruit products or derivatives in your food or preparation?
2452 2018-06-28 18:49:21 Its Pricky right
2453 2018-06-28 18:49:06 oh!イル
2454 2018-06-28 18:49:02 It’s talking about conserving nature by utilizing other oils asides palm oil from palm tree which was said to cause extinction of some species
2455 2018-06-28 18:49:02 What the hell are you talking about? The only utility savings I’m getting is from my solar panels on my roof! And you idiots took them off the White House to promote oil use!
2456 2018-06-28 18:48:42 Olive oil
2457 2018-06-28 18:48:35 That is going to be short lived. Crude Oil is way up this week
2458 2018-06-28 18:48:29 Fuck it. I’m about to do my own oil change cuz FUCK paying and I’m done asking my father. I’m a independent woman and believe in myself to do it.  Fuckwithme
2459 2018-06-28 18:48:25 I’d probably say yes! The sunflower sweets serum is really just a facial oil with a few added benefits and ingredients so it’d probably work! Only downside is that it’s not the kind of oil that dries down so it might add a little bit of oiliness to the face/wear of the foundation
2460 2018-06-28 18:48:22 CBD oil
2461 2018-06-28 18:48:22 Govt cut the exise duties 
If State get ready for Oil in GST before 19
20rs or more oil goes down 
RBI will raise Intrest rate to maintain Rs flow 
India keep eyes on america 
Trade war is not good for Asia
2462 2018-06-28 18:48:21 no, not at all! it could simply disappear - like fireworks 

- which would happen the minute Saudi Arabia would no longer accept it for oil...think about..what good does a pile of worthless USDs do for the Arabs when the oil is gone?
2463 2018-06-28 18:47:58 В озвучке автоинформатора автобуса сказали странную тираду про "oil and fat factory - maslozhirokombinat", но на "вторчермете" споткнулись
2464 2018-06-28 18:47:44 i once put my face over the steam coming off the boiling oil forgetting it's not the same as water & that's why i will never have clear skin
2465 2018-06-28 18:47:31 Why does Nigeria keep taking out World Bank loans (which insist on meddling in sovereign affairs) when the country has huge oil wealth?
2466 2018-06-28 18:47:26 Please do something about the ridiculous spike in oil prices! This should be illegal 
2467 2018-06-28 18:47:21 @toddstarnes what about cooking with coconut oil?
2468 2018-06-28 18:47:21 I think if you want real butter, they charge you. But I think the pump with OIL is still free at the condiment counter. Been a while since at the theatre for me as well. So maybe it’s not?
2469 2018-06-28 18:47:20 Crude oil's up another $0.50 to a new 3 1/2-year high of US$73.25-a barrel. Meanwhile - most petroleum stocks continue to languish. Contionued accumulation of the sector is warranted.

2472 2018-06-28 18:47:05 I have to try this! I applied beautifully when I apply by jojoba oil before, but I never thought of mixing it in!
2473 2018-06-28 18:47:03 I had the pharmacy order the oil because they didn’t have it in  Eyes still itchy but not sneezing as much. Got a stronger anti histamine called Zirtek which is actually really good.
2474 2018-06-28 18:46:59 I admire your optimism. We are dealing with an Oil Co here !!

2476 2018-06-28 18:46:48 damn i should prob get my oil changed today
2477 2018-06-28 18:46:48 It amuses me greatly that the scholar is the "bad guy" and the snake oil salesman is the "good guy" in Octopath Traveler according to the game's morality system.
2478 2018-06-28 18:46:40 The function of conservator in a transformer is___________________? -
A. to project against’internal fault
B. to reduce copper as well as core losses
C. to cool the transformer oil
D. to take care of the expansion and contraction of transformer oil due to variation of temp...
2479 2018-06-28 18:46:39 Factor 20.. wish I had used oil a bit lol x
2480 2018-06-28 18:46:31 Bruuuuuuh. I'm on a 96 shadow (well I would be if I would fix her and change her oil). I wanna try a sport pretty bad though.
2481 2018-06-28 18:46:16 Cost a fortune and an oil field to fill up. Stick to cars.....
2482 2018-06-28 18:46:13 I believe there way no road worthiness or inspection done on the tanker before leaving the port or oil farm.....We need to demand Accountability from our Government   #Otedola #otedolabridge
2483 2018-06-28 18:45:49 Bit dry England Belgium....
2484 2018-06-28 18:45:34 The Neoliberal Capitalist System is not sustainable, nature is sustainable everything is perfectly chained, synergist, and in balance but capitalism is like a car, without oil does not run, oil is investment, it is not sustainable needs an external injection
2485 2018-06-28 18:45:27 2 issues here Sunny...1.  Are you seriously crediting Trump for a recovery in Alberta??  And 2. Oil has recovered in price...but the differential for Alberta oil is very wide...meaning our oil prices haven't recovered.  Yet the economy is still improving.  Weird.
2486 2018-06-28 18:45:24 naa man silay massage oil!
2487 2018-06-28 18:45:14 Don't know what there wasn't to like about this candidate....
2488 2018-06-28 18:44:57 Held the door open for someone and they got the oil change that should’ve been mine
2489 2018-06-28 18:44:45 You can’t even sue the company that transports the oil. Bloody law makers will always side with money.

2501 2018-06-28 18:43:52 Whenever England play a good team, it's like watching oil paint dry to rah.
2502 2018-06-28 18:43:51 and then promptly steal the oil

2505 2018-06-28 18:43:23 Dude, I just tried booking a flight to Austria like every year. They ARE more expensive than ever and they got more expensive every year. Thanks Trump for high oil prices and US politicians for stupid useless airport security garbage that costs a fortune. Traverse pays for it all

2511 2018-06-28 18:42:54 Idk if it actually would work alone because I did take two Advil, but I diffused lavender and peppermint oil (in hot water because I don’t have a real one yet) next to my bed and laid down for an hour or so and my migraine is (mostly) gone and I’m living for this
2512 2018-06-28 18:42:41 Oil and gas are looking for another bailout.
2513 2018-06-28 18:42:28 As I told a Trumper today, who said Mueller has nothing because he hasn’t charged Trump with anything, “Prospectors don’t stop digging when they strike oil.”
2514 2018-06-28 18:42:26 I’m sitting dipping crusty bread into olive oil who the fuck do I think I am

2517 2018-06-28 18:42:12 @AskPayPal hi there, have just heard from a small business that they can't use Paypal because they sell CBD oil- can you clarify if this is correct please?
2518 2018-06-28 18:42:08 I also use pure lavender oil ~ few drops on a cloth ~ breath it in when suffering an anxiety attack definitely helps bring the heart rate down :)
2519 2018-06-28 18:42:04 22 Right-Wing Senators, led by Ted Cruz, who pressured Trump to extricate America from the Paris Climate accord, took over $10 million in "donations" from Big Oil. What do you think of those corrupt scumbags????
2520 2018-06-28 18:41:57 Sure, it had nothing to do with intense US sanction and the price of oil....just socialism.  How are you so bad at this?
2521 2018-06-28 18:41:54 Anyone noticed how poor @DuluxTrade solvent based finish paint has gone. Used oil eggshell left brushmarks and stipple from foam roller would not go down no flow at all. The satinwood takes almost a day to touch dry! Far worse flow than even water based

2524 2018-06-28 18:41:46 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2525 2018-06-28 18:41:42 This is all about oil.
2526 2018-06-28 18:41:36 @Deeyah_Khan heartbreaking. What’s the incentive for Saudi to treat women better when the West support them because of oil.
2527 2018-06-28 18:41:31 it's super good kasi you can control how cooked your food is, you can control how much oil you put on food just by drizzling a bit of oil and it'll still be cooked like it's been deep fried, and it's sooo easy to use. Also doubles as a defroster 
2528 2018-06-28 18:41:24 Such an honor to attend @ at the energy summit @ the Italian Embassy in Washington DC- IMARK is keeping going to make the difference in various sector including the Oil&Gas&Energy.

2531 2018-06-28 18:41:09 Keeping your hair in a ponytail is by far the best hairstyle to avoid breakouts. Your hair contains excess amounts of oil & dirt. Keeping it far away from your face at all times is crucial.
2532 2018-06-28 18:41:07 Abortion is not birth control. Don’t preach about keeping families together when you advocate the death of them before they begin - it makes you a snake oil salesman talking out 2 sides of your mouth.
2533 2018-06-28 18:41:07 Thank goodness for tea tree oil,,,i look alot better now lol

2536 2018-06-28 18:40:40 Snake oil? It's a fact Alberta pays and Quebec takes...and has no accountability.  Been like that for years.
2537 2018-06-28 18:40:38 That’s how sad your wife looks because she don’t want a little ambulance chasing snake oil salesmen like you and you won’t let her go. Coward.

2550 2018-06-28 18:39:16 If you can get to a cvs or Walgreens grab some peppermint oil capsules. Lifesavers!
2551 2018-06-28 18:39:07 The reason petrol is increasing is not because of @CyrilRamaphosa. The surge in petrol prices is being caused by the rise in global oil prices. A rise in oil means a rise in petrol. Stop putting blame on him for something he has no control over. Leave the man alone!!!!!!

2564 2018-06-28 18:37:53 It’s the itch that drives people mad. That itch scratch, and bleed cycle. Hard water areas affect the PH of the skin and can cause atopic eczema. Sunflower oil is soothing and antibacterial too. Give our NHS skincare @My_Trusty a try. #itchyskin #sunfloweroil
2565 2018-06-28 18:37:50 We need to co-opt oil into moving to nuclear generated electricity. We can shift their business to electricity by building nuclear power plants by their oil fields&using as much of their existing infrastructure as we can. Pipelines can be storm hardened electrical grid conduits.
2566 2018-06-28 18:37:50 US oil companies want to build platforms off the US coast and then 5 years down the line partner with Russian oil so they can send employees to work on those platforms.
High national security risk.
2567 2018-06-28 18:37:38 So, would you prefer wind turbines off the coast or oil drilling platforms? Wind turbines in the Southwest mountains or mountain tops removed for coal?
And, well, Germany's solar is far worst than Virginia's ... solar does work in the Commonwealth.

2589 2018-06-28 18:35:20 Of course. Thanks for sharing the talk! I'm all for (data) decentralization and aware of the dangers of data centralization. Yet, data does not have to be framed as the new oil to address the challenges of data centralization.

2593 2018-06-28 18:34:36 Gym Tip (who knows what number) . . 

Snake Oil, if there was a cream pill or potion that really did make you thin, I would sit at home and take that, I'd also be a millionaire 

trust me there is nothing, just hard work and sensible eating.

(steroids are a separate gym tip)
2594 2018-06-28 18:34:30 Snake oil selling cons.  That's who.

2596 2018-06-28 18:34:20 Is it not much cheaper to build the power plant close to the source rather than waiting tax payers money? Same thing he did with unrealistic looking for oil far away war zone in borno state that resulted to people being kidnapped and killed
2597 2018-06-28 18:34:18 nothing makes me happier than being able to pay for my own oil changes and full tanks. this weekend is abt to be poppin' ahehhhhh

2600 2018-06-28 18:34:03 While you’re on the subject, I’ve tried @kenjilopezalt quick immersion blender mayo with olive oil and it was terribly bitter. Anything I can do to make the recipe work with olive oil?

Oil "production" is not a strength. We have turned it into a crutch which will soon wear out with no replacement.
2603 2018-06-28 18:33:44 Fry them in oil I won’t eat them unless they’re basically a funnel cake
2604 2018-06-28 18:33:36 The realty is that taxes on oil is the big source for govt employees salaries.  Do not build city roads. Let people burn oil at jams. A Trend killed india growth. The day oil is history. U will have only batteries to tax. The day solar comes u will have nothing to tax on energy.

2613 2018-06-28 18:32:22 No, I tested and confirmed with plain oil si@ply blended alone as well. Same results with many testers: blending made the olive oil bitter.
2614 2018-06-28 18:32:18 Coconut oil is healthy and good for the heart.
2615 2018-06-28 18:32:09 Ladies,If cooking oil catches fire, turn off the burner and cover the pot. Never pour water on it!

2630 2018-06-28 18:30:11 I often wonder we should be spending our efforts rounding up every person we can to move to a single province and try to seccede. Alberta probably, 36% of them already support it, and there's oil.
2631 2018-06-28 18:30:03 Oil prices spike 13% in a week. What the heck is going on?
2632 2018-06-28 18:30:00 Anointing season if your watching online don't be left out grab your anointing oil and follow up #SMHOSliveservice
2633 2018-06-28 18:29:52 Oil is not good for anyone or the environment. There are much cleaner options that are sustainable and better for the planet. Trump will never invest in them because oil is more profitable.
2634 2018-06-28 18:29:44 Snake oil salesman selling you guys a lot of shiny objects! #specialtalent It'll never see completion. #lol #Foxconn
2635 2018-06-28 18:29:39 @KingTomas @AMRSwillPAYme they dont produce or sell oil but rather they service the oil companies it won't move with oil as much as earnings
2636 2018-06-28 18:29:37 Gas oil doesn’t catch fire and isn’t explosive.
2637 2018-06-28 18:29:36 increase in crude oil price n USD/INR is going to play disaster role for our country. 
2638 2018-06-28 18:29:32 Oil and lubrication systems are not only vulnerable to easy sabotage, but are critical in every machine with moving parts.
2639 2018-06-28 18:29:26 Give me an oil base bitch
2640 2018-06-28 18:29:18 Bro. We are an oil producing state. If they don’t move by day, the country would lose money fam
2641 2018-06-28 18:29:17 I have that eye treatment and  feel like it didn’t do much :/ I’ve been using it on and off for almost 2 years now. But, I haven’t tried bio oil! Thank you!
2642 2018-06-28 18:29:05 it's still milk--but also a lot of oil and stabilizers :/
2643 2018-06-28 18:29:03 Awesome, so kind how you prep for guests! Is that frosting made with Gun Oil?
2644 2018-06-28 18:28:58 Slowly slowly oil of lamp is going finish & broom is already injured as well as cycle is already lying puncture 
So what will happend with other u can understand.
2645 2018-06-28 18:28:51 Putting carrot oil on was all fun and games until a wasp attacked me
2646 2018-06-28 18:28:49 Switching mine to belt fed, problem solved.
2647 2018-06-28 18:28:42 & snake oil peddlers, as well.
2648 2018-06-28 18:28:39 I went to a CBD oil breakfast recently and it was DELIGHTFUL
2649 2018-06-28 18:28:23 Yeah but they can say the Otedola estate fire incident, but what do I know? I just don’t like the sound of his name associated with a fire caused by a oil tank, which could easily be confused with his oil company and senseless people will blame him without doing their research.
2650 2018-06-28 18:28:23 Done! I produce enough PV power for my home and 100BEV miles per day.  Industry and commerce can do the same.  But not if you have been fooled into thinking walking is the only solution because "Electric Cars" don't work.  I guess you think there was no society before oil?
2651 2018-06-28 18:28:18 Oil price has recovered from record lows but still haven't nearly recovered to post 2015 levels and yet the economy is strong.  Almost as if it's not just oil that's going on here, wouldn't you say?
2652 2018-06-28 18:28:16 @realDonaldTrump looks grotesque. Always has always will. His hair, his orange skin oil, his cat butt mouth and his evil dead eyes. Forever disgusting.
2653 2018-06-28 18:28:09 We’re like oil and water..We just don’t mix
2654 2018-06-28 18:27:58 I got one question: Won't this make the minor countries with crazy amounts of oil (Venezuela etc) OP?
2655 2018-06-28 18:27:45 Venezuela, Ecuador & Bolivia have consistently faced ruin by corruption of American Capitalists offering mythical white elephants & magical dreamland kingdoms in exchange for total control of all factors of production.

The American Dream is snake oil peddled by thieving conmen.
2656 2018-06-28 18:27:40 Went for an oil change... ended up having to buy two new tires  Now maybe I should have waited to buy that Apple Watch  I just love adult life ..
2657 2018-06-28 18:27:36 African black soap maybe by Shea moisture and let it sit on your skin for 7 minutes then use rose hip oil to moisturize your skin idk maybe it’ll work it works great for me
2658 2018-06-28 18:27:29 use a lot of coconut oil!
2659 2018-06-28 18:27:21 Love the smell of tea tree oil 
2660 2018-06-28 18:27:15 Works very well. Like the motor oil, the litter absorbs the liquid and the remaining dust picks up the residue. A bit of degreaser and the floor is as good as new. We use it in the shop if we’re out of the shop absorber we use

2662 2018-06-28 18:26:59 using tanning oil when ur a wee pale n fair thing is risky business
2663 2018-06-28 18:26:42 It's like eating yam with vegetable oil cos the butter melts 
2664 2018-06-28 18:26:20 If you are out there Dale Vince what is your view of Chargemaster being bought out by an Oil Company ??
Good, Bad ?                        Are you tempted by the obvious £billions they would pay you to sell out Ecotricity ??
2665 2018-06-28 18:26:18 St. Pius X on #civility: "They want to be treated with oil, soap and caresses, but they should be beaten with fists. In a fuel, you don't count or measure the blows, you strike as you can."
2666 2018-06-28 18:26:02 your pro oil trades have been amazing
2667 2018-06-28 18:25:50 Craving the purifying burn of oregano oil
2668 2018-06-28 18:25:35 Yeah. Same with the other stores. I was really disappointed to see a Trader Joe's marinara sauce I like has soy oil in it. Dead to me now.
2669 2018-06-28 18:25:30 Massive correction in Oil & gas sector

2670 2018-06-28 18:25:27 we close our eyes, we see their faces
enough with the oil portraits (though beautiful)
2671 2018-06-28 18:25:25 Coconut oil is not for your skin 
2672 2018-06-28 18:25:17 Will be coming up with some charts shortly. Some traders never believed 74 would ever hit in $OIL. Your sadly mistaken as 74 was just clipped. Some stated they will never trade again if 74 was clipped. 74 was hit today on oil. BAMMMMMM 
2673 2018-06-28 18:25:13 This is the first time I’ve bought this much at once, but even at my super high dose, a 2 gram jar into 1-2oz oil has been lasting me about a month. Have you ever taken CBD before?
2674 2018-06-28 18:25:12 Probably protecting the trademarks as well, much like the random Standard Oil Chevron station in SF
2675 2018-06-28 18:24:51 As Trump Campaign Chair in 2016 when Papadopolous and Page met with Russians, a Russian oil partnership confab was held at the Mayflower Hotel, and when Flynn and Sessions were hanging out with Russians, Lewandowski is hardly the person to talk about leadership
2676 2018-06-28 18:24:43 You're so right! I want Big Pharma, Big Banks, Big Oil and insurance companies running our lives like real Americans!!
2677 2018-06-28 18:24:41 I’m never ever gonna try to cook ever again . I dropped a little bit of oil on the stove and that shit  caught on fire
2678 2018-06-28 18:24:39 Practice the three D's:
• Drain: Empty out water containers at least once per week
• Dress: Wear long sleeves, long pants, and light-colored, loose-fitting clothing
• Defend: Properly apply an EPA registered repellent such as DEET, picaridin, IR 3535 or oil of lemon-eucalyptus
2679 2018-06-28 18:24:34 There’s a cafe with matcha lattes and CBD oil and kombucha in my little cornfield hometown and I’m like, SOUNDS GREAT TO ME.

2681 2018-06-28 18:24:27 chili oil parmesan crisps, guacamole, pepperoni stick, ranch dip, and broccoli & cauliflower. this is a fancy ass lunch. lmao
2682 2018-06-28 18:24:18 zucchini is always out of control (though ours haven't come in yet). i love just roasting beets, and then making nice salads with them (lemon juice and oil, chevre or feta).
2683 2018-06-28 18:24:17 Nigeria tells you it's a mixed economy
But it runs on socialist principles.. Or at least attempts to
Off oil profits.. That are waning
2684 2018-06-28 18:24:12 @chrissyteigen new body oil is EVERYTHING, smells amazing & has the perfect amount of glitter
2685 2018-06-28 18:24:04 Charlie, if anyone is "increasingly unhinged" it's Trudeau, Liberals and now the NDP! Trudeau has sabotaged every trade deal, oil pipelines, small businesses and anything else he can get his hands on! Investment is fleeing Canada and we're heading closer to Islamic rule and war!
2686 2018-06-28 18:24:01 I like to eat my food sometimes with mango pickle to add more flavor to the meal, but the smell be too strong and the oil be gettin everywhere
2687 2018-06-28 18:23:58 Cooking oil or fish oil they all end up frying fish

2690 2018-06-28 18:23:43 Thanks for pushing oil calls up with your oil demand ;-)
2691 2018-06-28 18:23:30 Any chargepoint owned by an Oil Co just has to be boycotted. We need to shut them down not add to their profits.
2692 2018-06-28 18:23:23 stop trump via #BakkenGate

i have uncovered more of his oil investments.
2693 2018-06-28 18:23:12 We could not run products pipelines, so we switched to road tankers. 

We can't run oil pipelines, so we are switching to barging.
2694 2018-06-28 18:23:00 shelby you will thank me lol make sure your soap is oil based too

2696 2018-06-28 18:22:46 Do they Not regulate the output of cheese like Oil companies do? Should they, if they don't? Do they expect for someone to pay for what they over-produce? Farmers should get fair payment for what they produce but too much doesn't dictate that they should. Supply/Demand right?
2697 2018-06-28 18:22:45 im in the natural gas and oil business ...
2698 2018-06-28 18:22:38 ......Drowning in the oil....... i am wondering where the hell are all those puppets talking b/s in the last 20 years of panic......
2699 2018-06-28 18:22:35 Honestly that should do it too. I wonder how much of a difference specific qualities of the oil make. Do peppery ones get more so? Or does bitterness come out more in grassy oils etc? Something more going on here if we want to square our conflicting results.
2700 2018-06-28 18:22:34 Coat cubes in sesame oil, soy sauce, salt and pepper and stick in the oven for half an hour.
2701 2018-06-28 18:22:20 I couldn’t do a regular 9-5 5 days a week, every week 

Thank oil god for 9/80s.
2702 2018-06-28 18:22:19 Here at Camp Phil we care about the future of our planet. That's why we've signed a lucrative sponsorship deal with a giant oil company to allow them to secretly frack the bejesus out of the British countryside.
2703 2018-06-28 18:21:52 Steel beams don’t melt without controlled demolition! George Washington was a robot powered by steam! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
2704 2018-06-28 18:21:48 Interesting that Corrigan does not want anything to do with an oil pipeline but he is quick to tax it.
2705 2018-06-28 18:21:40 honestly tho who came up with the word oil
2706 2018-06-28 18:21:30 Phoenix Dice. 
Eclipse Dice. 
Vortex Dice.
Night Oil Dice.
2707 2018-06-28 18:21:20 Yeah, I don't think I do these days but lord knows if THE BIG ONE happens I imagine at the bare minimum the supply chains to stores would be fucked for a while. Doesn't hurt to keep some freeze dried food and propane and lamp oil and extra cat food on hand.
2708 2018-06-28 18:21:19 I waste roughly around 3 minutes everyday struggling to open my coconut oil
2709 2018-06-28 18:20:41 Going to a cbd oil dinner party tonight. Is NYC the new LA?

2716 2018-06-28 18:20:14 @TicklishBigfoot In large doses palm oil is dangerous however in small amounts it is not dangerous. I can assure you all of our products are completely pet friendly.

2718 2018-06-28 18:20:06 Made 2 batches of pesto, one blending Gallo with Basil and everything else, and the other mixing the oil after - the difference was brutal, the first batch was waaay more bitter
2719 2018-06-28 18:19:49 Um, Mr. Cooper he has never not colluded with Putin in public.All has been in plain sight, his adoration& partnership have been on full display. G-8 anyone.The mistake I think people make is that Putin has something on him.He is a willing participant. Rosfnet oil.#GLOBALOLIGARCHY
2720 2018-06-28 18:19:44 Putin wants the pipeline I’ve always thought that was why Tillerson was selected, the sanctions halt the Russian pipeline, and remember one thing trump is obsessed w/ OIL
2721 2018-06-28 18:19:26 I'd say it's things like oil spills and capitalist production killing the environment - let's stop that and keep plastic straws for those who need it and recycle them!!!!
2722 2018-06-28 18:19:19 Translation, helping Big oil and Gas to drill in former pristine National Wilderness.
Remember, the tradeoff for voting for the tax scam.
Nothing like giving tax breaks and land to Big Oil.
2723 2018-06-28 18:19:13 Oil up $9 in 2 weeks with rates and gold down.

Try to figure that one out folks.

2725 2018-06-28 18:18:57 My hair needs castor oil and I've putting off buying it for no reason at all. I don't take care of my hair as well as I used to, ziyandoyisa ngoku zikhulayo
2726 2018-06-28 18:18:43 Causes:
Venezuela can't produce oil
Opec decreased production to boost price
US has put trade tarrifs on our steel
US vs China trade war
US vs the world
China dumped the $
All emerging markets suffered.
Market bloodbath.
2727 2018-06-28 18:18:40 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
2728 2018-06-28 18:18:37 You can have a dream about riding a horse, or you can have a dream about drowning in oil!
2729 2018-06-28 18:18:34 Depreciation should be matching crude oil prices. As global crude oil prices increase, rupee should be depreciated so lesser rupee needs to be printed to buy imports.
2730 2018-06-28 18:18:33 Magnesium Oil mixed in lotion has cleared my skin up tremendously

2733 2018-06-28 18:18:04 Wonder if Ecotricity has any intentions to sell out to an Oil Co like Chargemaster has. A test of Dale Vince and his principles.
2734 2018-06-28 18:18:02 Maybe ask the Venezuela people how it’s working out. Oil rich nation where folks are eating the zoo animals.

2737 2018-06-28 18:17:27 When UN care about the people of Middle East !!!
In #Libya they care about their oil
In #Syria they care about big power like Russia and Israel
In #Yemen they care for instability to continue
2738 2018-06-28 18:17:21 Donald Trump is reversing Obama’s protections on the ocean from oil spills
2739 2018-06-28 18:17:01 the yield curve, is flat oil is up and the deficit is exploding - Hey GOP what is not to like u have been in charge long enough to once again destroy the economy
2740 2018-06-28 18:16:57 I'm glad you have an opinion. These liberals hate oil. They continue to say it. They won't be building this trans mountain expansion. That's pretty obvious. The conservatives will be building it. A whole lot of substance there compared your irrelevant pointless ramble.
2741 2018-06-28 18:16:52 I go to this place called 10-Minute Oil Change and those bitches don't mess around.  I think I was out of there in like 8 minutes today.

2745 2018-06-28 18:16:26 Clear that every EV driver must never use chargemaster again because you wil give profit to Oil Companies.

2754 2018-06-28 18:15:29 You guessed its to keep the drawing clean, so that no oil or grease from my hand gets onto the image.
2755 2018-06-28 18:15:20 Elon is your religious leader.  This is how people react when their prophet, guru, etc. is criticized by objective third parties.  BTW, to you know how much oil it takes to extract the minerals and build these cars?  You may be surprised by the answer.
2756 2018-06-28 18:15:10 Or just marinade those mushrooms in olive oil, balsamic vinegar, fresh pepper and sea salt before grilling. Skip the burger completely.
2757 2018-06-28 18:15:04 They both are close to each other but I heard the driver say Capital Oil later. I didn't notice before

So will the SNP be decommissioning the oil industry?

2764 2018-06-28 18:14:41 It doesn't all happen on oil rigs. Lots of infrastructure just as important.

2771 2018-06-28 18:13:41 Electronics like smartphones are most productive imports, they have revolutionized  communication, improved efficiency, education and connecting Indians to the world. Soon you will even see oil imports reducing because of electronics.
2772 2018-06-28 18:13:32 And oil drilling in sensitive areas is not bad? Joe about fracking and water pollution that goes with it? You and jay cool with that?
2773 2018-06-28 18:13:32 Is that an the oil incident that took place earlier in Nigeria
2774 2018-06-28 18:13:31 Tra l'altro Lucas Oil è fratello di Olivia Oil, la compagna di Braccio di Ferro che ce l'ha con Bruto. E visto che Voldemort è un bruto il cerchio si chiude #foxbaseball
2775 2018-06-28 18:13:30 Oh crap, I was cooking something in the morning with hot chili oil from Rwanda.  I had an allergy attack so I was rubbing my eyes with my hands.  BOY, do I regret this!  Itch and now my eyes burn!
2776 2018-06-28 18:13:25 Oooh yeah we use that for car oil in the driveways, so it must work for that too!
2777 2018-06-28 18:13:07 Cheap cat litter! Sassy it works it absorbs the oil leave for an hour or so (have a cuppa watch some tv)then sweep it up and mop floor.
2778 2018-06-28 18:13:06 @ABDanielleSmith 
I think we can expect a lot more promotion of natural gas and oil as an election is on the horizon

2788 2018-06-28 18:12:24 I totally agree. Sandalwood is amazing. Especially sandalwood oil plus lavender oil in a bath before bed. 
2789 2018-06-28 18:12:20 My mom is always right I don’t know why I still don’t listen to her she kept telling me to put sunscreen on and my dumbass was like nah I don’t burn I’m gonna use tanning oil  now my whole entire body is BURNT

2794 2018-06-28 18:11:41 We are fighting a feckless GOP, snake oil salesman, their mindless base, AND the Russians who are providing the logistical, technical and financial support to destroy democracy.  By the time the base realizes they sold out the country, it will be too late.
2795 2018-06-28 18:11:40 If its "all about money money money and not about people's lives", why don't you abandon North Sea oil altogether Brian?
2796 2018-06-28 18:11:35 She didn’t call it quits bc she’s self-impressed and feels her opinion would be better than anyone else’s.  It’s gonna’ backfire bc she’s not as smart as she thinks she is.  
2797 2018-06-28 18:11:24 @Moroccanoil How can we get our hands on your products (specifically the oil) in France or Germany?
2798 2018-06-28 18:11:00 Well said indeed EVM. @ChargemasterPlc has certainly done a deal with the devil here. Let’s hope they will be a positive influence on BP, but I do not trust Oil companies and have deep worries about this take-over.

2811 2018-06-28 18:09:40 thing abt hyaluronic acid is you need smt else to lock it in or it’ll do the exact opposite and it’ll dry your skin out as you said, i really like rosehip oil BUT a moisturiser that’s p legit is the origins ginzing energy boosting gel moisturiser 
2812 2018-06-28 18:09:39 We're at the end of the Republicans. We're at the end of white Christian America being the deciding force without artificial means. We're at the end of big oil. These waning forces are hanging off a cliff trying to pull us down. We need to pry away their grip and let them fall.
2813 2018-06-28 18:09:32 •Always moisturize your hair with an intensive conditioner to regain the essential oil loss near the scalp and hair.
•Trim your hair weekly to prevent split end as straight hair is most prone to split ends.
•Include protein rich food as it promotes healthy hair growth.
2814 2018-06-28 18:09:09 A bigot who doesn't even posses basic math skills. Soros was born in Hungary August 1930. He just turned 8 at the TofM, 9 when Hitler invaded Poland. Turned 13 as the Allies took Sicily. Turned 14 days before Paris was liberated. All while Fred Koch built Hitler an oil refinery.

2818 2018-06-28 18:08:45 ➽ he mumbled. 

      Though hopefully the other didn't hear. Hopefully he'd be left alone soon, and then he can drain himself of the old oil and turn off.

2821 2018-06-28 18:08:22 The #Ugandan government has destroyed natural forests for palm oil production on Kalangala island. More to be destroyed on Buvuma island
2822 2018-06-28 18:08:18 Coconut oil is so good for health and diet. I'll try to use it every day.
2823 2018-06-28 18:08:16 Your head dae there 
2824 2018-06-28 18:08:13 2015 me sab halat kharab thi. Oil was lowest curve.
2825 2018-06-28 18:08:08 18th and 19th century whalers hunted whales for their oil, which was used as lamp fuel and lubricant.
2826 2018-06-28 18:08:06 No doubt backed by pro Oil Tories. Clear that one of two things will happen. BP will remove all the charge points or they will charge an extortionate rate for a kWh, and no one will use them and then they will close them down.
2827 2018-06-28 18:07:56 I recently got into oil cleansers. Tried it cuz of Korean skincare routines.

2830 2018-06-28 18:07:40 I discuss electric cars only as an investment trend, not to save the planet. Electric cars use coal, hydro, nuclear, solar, wind, wave, hydraulic ram, methane, oil and diesel. It’s just much more flexible. It’s “emissions” depend on the source.
2831 2018-06-28 18:07:35 Just like they teach American childrens to grow up and destroy countries for the sake of oil
2832 2018-06-28 18:07:32 No oil extraction before political reforms in Somali Region. It is the trait of colonialism to prefer tyrants when looting natural resources. The new Ethiopian government must not repeat the mistakes of its predecessors. @FarahMaalimM @Jawar_Mohammed @fitsumaregaa @Omar_hao
2833 2018-06-28 18:07:32 Been on the beach for about 3/4 hours and I have not changed colour. Even used a shit ton of tanning oil. Mmm
2834 2018-06-28 18:07:13 okay, my entire haitian american life i'd never seen anyone use black castor oil for hair so when i went natural and discovered that that was A Thing, i was just like '....LWIL MASKRITI???? are you SURE' and i *still* feel that way when i put it in my hair
2835 2018-06-28 18:07:12 "oil & gas industry plans to build a petrochemical refining & storage hub along Ohio River have gained traction. Proponents hope this...which would straddle PA, Ohio, W Virginia, and KY, could someday rival the industrial corridor found along the Gulf Coast in Texas & Louisiana."
2836 2018-06-28 18:07:07 America killed more than 10 thousand Iragi and 500 children died as a result of hunger in a year just because of oil. Does oil value more than human life? When you apply the illogical to explain your logic
2837 2018-06-28 18:07:04 I Need A Oil Change, Wheel Alignment && A Car Wash.  Should’ve Been Came Out.
2838 2018-06-28 18:06:54 Less than a hour to take over the entire country. Most likely less than 30 minutes.

It may eventually happen. Them having nukes or not. There is a LOT of fresh water up there, and eventually fresh water will be the new oil. Water is what wars will be fought over in the future.
2839 2018-06-28 18:06:53 Y'all can burn and boil yourselves in hot oil being angry at people who chose not to vote for Hillary. You are angry alone.  You and your rage exist in an echo chamber.
2840 2018-06-28 18:06:51 I go to the store for one bottle of sunscreen and come out with a sunscreen, a tanning oil, and a self-tanner. I already own three self-tanners.
2841 2018-06-28 18:06:50 It depends on what share of GDP oil sales constitute.
2842 2018-06-28 18:06:34 @EIAgov How does the Eia obtain oil inventory data?
2843 2018-06-28 18:06:33 We have plenty of our own oil. Let’s drill and utilize our Natural Respurces in the meantime while we work on alternate energy options.
2844 2018-06-28 18:06:26 I wonder if the type of olive oil matters, though I’ve experienced and tested this with multiple types.
2845 2018-06-28 18:06:20 I said, Gabriel, that eateth with fresh oil.
2846 2018-06-28 18:06:17 Let's hope it's resilient enough to withstand even Trump.  Besides if his Iran and other related policies drive the cost of a crude oil barrel up and send gas to over $4/gal that by itself will probably mean electoral carnage for GoP in Nov,
2847 2018-06-28 18:06:17 How does the Eia obtain oil inventory data?
2848 2018-06-28 18:06:03 Cheese steak with lettuce, tomato, onions, mayo AND oil and vinegar.  Great studying fuel.
2849 2018-06-28 18:05:57 Last year wasn’t a matter of development (like aerodynamic dev.) because Merc were clearly the strongest plus all the regulation changes killed us. After the 0.6l oil regulation we dropped completely performance

2852 2018-06-28 18:05:29 My car was 7,000 miles over for an oil change, and if that doesn’t show how poorly I have my life together idk what does.
2853 2018-06-28 18:05:02 I’d say this over and over again, Buhari do not own oil well. Just telling the fact.
2854 2018-06-28 18:04:59 Looking to go green? A lot of electricity is produced using coal or oil, which produces high emissions. When you use natural gas for both cooling and heating, you put less demand on the electrical grid, which means fewer emissions and more clean air.
2855 2018-06-28 18:04:54 Roti n chapati both r different.. Roti is easy to digest other side chapati have oil it’s hart to digest.. mom always right. Ab sach bataiye aapko bola ya brother ko 
2856 2018-06-28 18:04:50 That’s a valid point @ChargemasterPlc  are now accepting money from big oil to help fund @POLARnetwork , but is that not environmentally “dirty money” Oil companies have history of mining ,oil/plastic production,refining,huge CO2/air/water pollution, oil spills etc @au_tom_otive
2857 2018-06-28 18:04:49 Not entirely true. The conglomerates are to blame. Follow the $ if you want to find the truth. The food industry pushes for sugar, the pharmacopoeia pushes for side effects and the oil industry pushes for war. There is no money in Vaccines. Medication is a different story.

2866 2018-06-28 18:03:57 Hate to tell you this but to not a myth. Repeat the testing with more tasters. I did the original tests at Cook’s Illustrated and the results with around 30 tasters were pretty clear cut whether in emulsified mayonnaise or simply blended oil in a vitamix.

2873 2018-06-28 18:03:08 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
2874 2018-06-28 18:03:03 I have a new car also & if it’s like mine it’ll tell you what your oil % is & the place I take mine says it’s good to get it done around 20%
2875 2018-06-28 18:03:02 @OilChangers_ON  I had my oil changed, new air filter, emissions test plus all sorts of little extras, in a short time, at my convenience, with superb, kind and really friendly staff. Highly recommend! #ygk My Pathfinder is a happy boy

2884 2018-06-28 18:01:20 The pushing out of US oil companies & the US' response will be interesting to say the least.
2885 2018-06-28 18:01:15 Yep...con artists making predictions out of their ass.. without a clue about oil when all they do is sell sub services
2886 2018-06-28 18:01:11 The government of Kyrgyzstan has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Leonardo DiCaprio in a dornix wig.

2899 2018-06-28 18:00:06 I think the tablespoon of cannacoconut oil I put in my oatmeal is helping things a bit. I dosed it to be used in teaspoons, so I’m tripling down today. 
2900 2018-06-28 18:00:06 hmmm... maybe you can try watching some time lapses of portraits. That has helped me a lot when I'm not sure how to color somthing specific? 
I like oil painting time lapses, because they focus a lot on how to blend and color.

2907 2018-06-28 17:59:11 The last time humans had to adapt to major climate change was about 10.5k years ago. Population was a tiny fraction of today’s, and could migrate unhindered.

As for burning less coal, we now burn many times more oil, and consumption & carbon emissions are still increasing.
2908 2018-06-28 17:59:11 If I recall a few years ago oil was over $100 a barrel and it came right back down. It’s called the market genius. It goes up, it comes down that’s how it’s always worked.

2911 2018-06-28 17:58:36 On the other end, we're not a purely capitalistic society either... then we'd be Chile. I always thought it was our checks and balances. Maduro has so much concentrated power, he was never kept in check. That, and their GDP was like over 90% based on oil.

2925 2018-06-28 17:57:08 US oil is good for the US, he has been attacked on twitter for two years now, it’s called free speech, he didn’t insult the handicapped, I’m sure you have called someone retarded, be honest, he didn’t say anything bad about handicapped people, and every president lives lavishly.
2926 2018-06-28 17:57:02 Something should be done so that CBD oil is more affordable. I just started taking it & am impressed w/ how well it works. My goal is 2 get off my pain meds & use only CBD oil. Possible?
2927 2018-06-28 17:56:48 Good on you @meghanmccain, Trump, like the @GOP, are selling toxic snake oil. It’s easy to message lies. People want to believe them but it takes sleaze bags with zero morals to peddle them. Congrats on your “superior messaging.” @theview @joybehar was RIGHT.
2928 2018-06-28 17:56:46 Gotcha
2929 2018-06-28 17:56:41 My last oil change was end of March but I’ve come to realize I get one about every 3 months & I wanted to know am I doing numbers in my car or is that hoe often other people get theirs changed also
2930 2018-06-28 17:56:40 Hate to be a broken record but until someone gives a nod to Nicauragua murdering their citizens with the nation in chaos, having a difficult time supporting oil producing nations only in the media. It's just unethical.
2931 2018-06-28 17:56:36 We are expecting a decision on the #Line3 pipeline any minute. The PUC is on break until 1:15 CST.

2934 2018-06-28 17:56:32 Tea tree oil works for me but not a lot and like maybe twice a week because it’s really strong and Castor oil as well. Good luck girl!
2935 2018-06-28 17:56:12 But now that he said it, trump supporters will buy it! trump is a snake oil salesman and his base can't wait to buy more. Won't they be surprised by the rash his salve leaves behind!
2936 2018-06-28 17:56:10 A big liar!! Lies in the name of Bhagwan & holy places. What kind of treatment such ppl get as per Hindu mythology? A large size metal tub full of hot oil. Does it have any connection?
2937 2018-06-28 17:56:06 Dinosaurs Thrived for 150million years, in a 1600-7000ppm C02 environment, Today its just 380ppm.  Alberta was once a subtropical climate. then submerged under a mile of ice.  We do have to stop squandering the Oil Mother Earth gave us. Global Warming? Thats Mother Natures job.
2938 2018-06-28 17:55:47 It's been a very devastating week.  I just saw a video of Oil tanker that got burnt at Otedola bridge alongside a lot of cars and most definitely people inside them. God please save Nigeria
2939 2018-06-28 17:55:20 LOLOLOLOL $130?!  Did they at least let you smoke a cigarette after they screwed you?  Or was this like one of those oil changes with drug dealers?
2940 2018-06-28 17:55:19 Not bad but it sticks like a remora on me - far stronger adhesive IMHO than the Dexcom. Baby oil does the trick for removing it. I do use IV Prep on occasion depending where I place it.

2943 2018-06-28 17:54:54 NAILS 

•trim them regularly (IG: @xselfcarebb)
•use an oil on your cuticles to keep them healthy and helps grow them
•use hand cream
•don’t bite them 
•if you have fake nails remove them gently, not with force
•wash hands thoroughly 
•file them into your desired shape
2944 2018-06-28 17:54:54 i imagine the folks who find the taste of CBD oil to be disagreeable have most likely never toss & washed kratom

2949 2018-06-28 17:54:33 Coconut oil mixed with food helps tremendously, and we brush with a defurminator brush every couple of days. After a couple of times, it dramatically reduces the hair all over
2950 2018-06-28 17:54:10 the democratically elected gov’t which introduced social programs that have had very positive results but pissed-off the big $ elites. That just like in Syria, the West is funding the opposition because we want Venezuela’s oil, etc., & THEY are committing horrendous violence. 2/
2951 2018-06-28 17:54:07 A tanker exploded around d otedola estate, Berger Lagos. Very tragic incident if I must say. 
This sort of things rarely happen in a working economy. Proper checks are done before putting anyone in harms way. Railroad is very needed in Nigeria since we are an oil producing nation
2952 2018-06-28 17:54:03 Great podcast guys! Fresh and authentic. I was blown away by Chloe’s life story. As for the fondue, the one with oil and meat is Fondue Bourguignonne I guess. More French than Swiss for that matter! Anyway, keep it up!

2966 2018-06-28 17:52:59 Do you think India will be able to keep the oil imports going?

I really hope a rising power like India doesn't cave in to US pressure. 1998 post Pokhran sanctions have shown that India can withstand any amount of foreign dhamki.

2976 2018-06-28 17:52:08 Seems like the market is just forcing a higher oil price narrative too soon. Not that oil shouldn't be costlier, but this weeks wti shortage was due to record exports. Also Iran is a 4th qtr problem for active trade, not now. Cheers!

2979 2018-06-28 17:52:02 Epic fail. False equivalency is the last refuge of scoundrel. Comparing US economy to Iran. Iran's economy is the size of Connecticut which is only a midsize state. Your GDP with all the oil wealth is embarrassing. Turkey and South Korea have no oil but have a higher GDP.

2989 2018-06-28 17:51:16 Oh?   I may have to try that. I have oily skin and finding products that keep me matte is so hard. Also, if you glasses slide down your nose a lot because of your makeup/oil, put eyeshadow primer on the sides of your nose. It works wonders for me.
2990 2018-06-28 17:51:15 Yes a lot still think that’s why we keep them , think what it used to be worth it was like producing oil

3003 2018-06-28 17:49:59 As a long-chain hydrocarbon petroleum product, asphalt has a higher carbon footprint than a metal roof, and asphalt shingles release oil into the environment as they deteriorate. Unlike asphalt, metal roofs can be easily and completely recycled if replaced.

Will you be stopping all Scottish fishermen from fishing in the North Sea, if the fracking is polluting the waters?
3011 2018-06-28 17:49:35 Kail, try combing the dog with a little coconut oil all over the coat (after a bath with a good, quality vet-approved shampoo). Coconut oil keeps the skin moisturized as well as staves off some parasites and other undesirables, while also helping to slow down the hair loss.

3041 2018-06-28 17:47:04 #Saudi oil production is likely to hit 10.8 million to 10.9 million barrels a day in July, up from around 10.6 million in June and 10.03 million in May, according to the people close to the oil ministry. -WSJ #OOTT

High crude oil prices, geo-political concerns and looming fears of a global trade war. 

In the present context, the value of rupee has fallen or depreciated from about Rs 66 to a dollar to about Rs 69 in less than two months.

3062 2018-06-28 17:44:20 It’s been the best looking field all year but looks like it’s struggling at the moment. The oil seed on the heavier land looks a lot better.

3075 2018-06-28 17:42:55 @moviemagicjbp I had an opportunity to watch a movie here. The ambience is average, eatables are overpriced and for sure the edible oil used for frying French fries was substandard. Coke was priced at par with metro multiplexes. Overall below par experience.
3076 2018-06-28 17:42:40 I reckon fried bread made sense when people used solid animal fat for frying, rather than oil.
3077 2018-06-28 17:42:29 eyedrops really?? ima try it! i always put aragan oil and it goes back to normal but then in a couple days it dries up again :/
3078 2018-06-28 17:42:27 US wants India obey sanctions and stop importing oil completely. India says no and will only obey UN Security Council sanctions. If US imposes sanctions on us things can get messy. Rupee is already all time low

3082 2018-06-28 17:42:11 why people hate america? because you put yourself as the heroes of freedom and democraqcy, but you're not better than Russia or China. At least they don't pretend to be human rights champions, while torturing and waging war killing random people with drones just to take their oil

3089 2018-06-28 17:41:18 Little off topic, but hey who can keep up! Before you became POTUS, in a CNN interview ; you said that OPEC would not last without US protection. Of course this is in regard to gasoline prices. What gives?? Please do something . Oil prices increase ...
3090 2018-06-28 17:41:10 It was past her bed time.
3091 2018-06-28 17:41:09 Also, Venezuela, Mr economist, failed when oil prices crashed, but that's what happens when you try to support a society using a Detroit style economy. Layman term would be "putting all your eggs in one basket"

3096 2018-06-28 17:40:37 Thank you. Beyond EU regulations and cross contamination risk, I was concerned that the emulsifier mono and diglycerides of fatty acids lusted as an ingredient may use soy bean oil as the starting material. If it is another oil then this is no problem but wanted to check!

3105 2018-06-28 17:39:56 I suggest ppl watch the series #Occupy on Netflix, a speculative & acclaimed thriller about Russia's invasion of Norway over oil production. The series pissed Russia off but maybe it wasn't so farfetched after all. Maybe prescient.

3114 2018-06-28 17:39:10 It's oil, anything's possible... but lotta downside before I'd say yes. And only an hour or so to go,
3115 2018-06-28 17:39:01 You have closed down our national parks and want to use destroy them to find oil.  You kidnap children and deperate them from their parents.  You disregard the rule of law and take away at our rights one at a time so you can be a dictator. If you worry about Iran then go there.
3116 2018-06-28 17:38:55 Sitting at the car dealership waiting for an oil change and tire rotation and trying to write a results section. It's going about as well as you might expect. 

At least the TV is showing soccer instead of the news.

Especially since Canada is a big exporter of oil and gas - something Russia would like a piece of.
3142 2018-06-28 17:35:10 Cooking oil is oil that is used to cook e.g sunflower oil, canola and olive oil. Fish oil yona I have no idea what it is. Maybe its oils within the fish. But, as I said, I don't know.

3146 2018-06-28 17:34:58 I've done this and words cannot describe my joy, in that moment, that my floors were ceramic tile.
It still got into the grout of course, but it could have been SO much worse.
There were droplets of olive oil in the oddest places for weeks afterward, that I hadn't seen initially.
3147 2018-06-28 17:34:54 Yes I make money in a country where oil is plenty and it is a Muslim country. Why I do because they respect me. Do you think they hired me because I am a sanghi? Grow up and start acting like one. I am not a bigot like you.

I'm saying just because we may seem to agree with US, let's not think it's bowing to pressure. It could be an independent, objective decision as well
3160 2018-06-28 17:32:53 @sambitswaraj - from where you came and now have created a name for yourself and a job with some oil company. You Mr Patra should start a institute on training people on how to become famous by targeting congress.

3170 2018-06-28 17:31:30 So the stock market tanking (and my 401K shrinking) because of fears over retaliatory tariffs, just doesn’t count because it doesn’t fit your koolaid-drinker narrative?  And oil prices rising because of tensions with Iran, also? So weird how hard you MAGAs try to avoid reality.
3171 2018-06-28 17:31:28 24 din ki hakumat her 1 sy phadda 2 numri bugjet...oil ki price zayada...garibon ky dushman abassi ki hakumat.

3174 2018-06-28 17:31:21 What's the difference between cooking oil and fish oil?
3175 2018-06-28 17:31:18 She's well in with those oil Arabs at City so that's what itv think might qualify her and doesn't she go out with a French footballer if I'm not mistaken

3179 2018-06-28 17:30:14 @TobyBaxendale is from Legatum Institute. Of Shanker Singham notoriety. They are basically snake oil salesmen looking to profit from disaster capitalism by engineering the hardest of brexits.
3180 2018-06-28 17:30:13 Republicans and oaths. Like oil and water.
3181 2018-06-28 17:30:06 @Safeway Juanita would it be too much to ask for just one single salad dressing made with 100%  olive oil .. and no vegetable or seed oils? I know it's more expensive I'm willing to pay. #braggs would also like some probiotic pickles :-)

3184 2018-06-28 17:29:42 @KilduffReport Hi John! Looking for comment on the US order to cut Iran oil imports and the implications for India and China. If you can answer a few quick Qs by tomorrow afternoon please DM me - thanks!! -Natasha
3185 2018-06-28 17:29:27 I use it every day but it’s really thick so idk about every day for your hair. Definitely do hot oil treatments once a week
3186 2018-06-28 17:29:23 And yet they expect the GNA will be able to push more youth from western Libya to take over the oil so the Gravy Train can keep going .
3187 2018-06-28 17:29:17 Love coconut oil, great for my cooking
3188 2018-06-28 17:29:04 I am addicted to coconut oil everything
3189 2018-06-28 17:29:02 Story pitch:

This involves alternate dimensions, black holes, time -altering rain, babies, umbilical cords, death, craters, packages, and hands... Tons of oil filled hand prints

"EWWWW, WHAT?!!!"

But it'll be made by Kojima and Del Toro..

"Oh. I dig it."

Whaaaat?

3191 2018-06-28 17:28:56 The only girl that hits on me is the chick who does my oil change every 3-4 months  I’m about to start going to valvoline more often just for the confidence boost
3192 2018-06-28 17:28:53 My next five paychecks are going straight to my car and I’m not okay with that. I’ll take the bus, fudge insurance, tires, oil changes, bumper repairs, and everything else that will soon knock on my bank account demanding money.
3193 2018-06-28 17:28:49 The whole country is sleeping naked and we are running out of fake tan. A kind of Irish oil crisis! #heatwave
3194 2018-06-28 17:28:37 I’m at DarCars Kia getting my car serviced and I’ve been hit on by every dude I’ve came across ... old, black, white, young, .. I just want my oil changed man, that’s all

3198 2018-06-28 17:28:19 Perry has more allegiance to his wealthy oil & gas industry friends in Texas than he does Trump.
3199 2018-06-28 17:28:12 If only you can open your eye and realize that politicians are bedfellows whose common interest is sharing oil money by using gullible masses as fallible bet. Commom sense pdp to apc.
3200 2018-06-28 17:28:05 He could get Iain Gray to work out how an oil fund is financed while waiting for the wind to stop blowing and the sun to cease shining.

3206 2018-06-28 17:27:31 sitting out in this heat from 9 this morning covered in carrot oil was definitely not the best idea i’ve come up with..burnt !! But on the other hand @keela_daniel has had it worse with sun stroke dying in her bed:)) had better thursdays x
3207 2018-06-28 17:27:23 Nothing like a carefully planned financial program ... as opposed to oil the squeaky wheel and hope that the others don’t shout.    Continues to demonstrate the total ineptitude of this government to deliver anything but damage and disillusionment to the public sector.
3208 2018-06-28 17:27:21 US and Russia are good friends
You never fight on your land 
This is all game of making crude oil price high
3209 2018-06-28 17:27:16 About to lather my ass up with coconut oil and tan 
3210 2018-06-28 17:27:12 I was playing Cities: Skylines for the Xbox One and I chucked because on the "radio" they mocked fossil fuels, so GD hard. Refers to the oil company as "Dino Oil" and says it’s the "Original form of recycling, because it’s from old dino bones"
3211 2018-06-28 17:27:06 Hahaha oil se kuch ni hoga bro, just leave the missing area as it is or koi 2 maheenay beard mat katwao, just halki c trim kro khudi, barber k pas mat jao, 2 months baad proper khat krwao phir dekhna missing area khudi kam dikhne lage ga
3212 2018-06-28 17:27:00 This guy is so happy with the NDP cap on the Oil Sands because it means there's no room for any of his competitors. NDP scores one for big oil on the backs of Albertans.
3213 2018-06-28 17:26:57 Trust us. There are 0 essential oils that you should use undiluted. And the research proves that. 20 years ago it was believed that it was fine, however we now know that risk of Sensitization occurs whenever you use any oil neat. 

Your vet is very very incorrect. Terrifyingly so
3214 2018-06-28 17:26:54 I meant to say "I need an oil change", instead I said "I need a root canal" wtf is wrong with me #dentalhygieneprobs @dthyproblems
3215 2018-06-28 17:26:46 Used it myself. Actually had 2 of the work trucks oil changed there in the last week. So far, so good. Can't beat the concept.
3216 2018-06-28 17:26:38 I know right? Nasdaq only tacking on 35 soooo sooo ugly  right.  Must be the DOW oh hell no it's up 62.  maybe it's oil...nope $74   guess they can only be talking about gold....yep 19 days down since BAMA said buy
3217 2018-06-28 17:26:36 I was taking adderall, Ativan and a beta blocker for adhd, depression and anxiety. I stopped all of that once I tried CBD oil. Now the locals are trying to say it’s illegal.. WTF!! #CBD #MarijuanaMovement

3225 2018-06-28 17:25:56 Okay. Please ans 3 qtns 1. Why was oil price higher in 2013. 2. With inflation 0 in US why rupee inflated and 3. Why oil production went down in India when barrel price started to rise. Will discuss once you figure out.
3226 2018-06-28 17:25:45 I asked for an oil change they talking bout I need 2 brand new tires .
3227 2018-06-28 17:25:44 My friend and colleague owns property in what used to be the richest country in South America. You wouldn't have bet on a rich country with huge oil reserves facing starvation, either.
3228 2018-06-28 17:25:42 Scary, where is that shale oil ? Oh yeah, Alberta sans not mixed!!
3229 2018-06-28 17:25:40 To go shoot hoops, spend 1k, get an oil change, go workout, or do all of that....
3230 2018-06-28 17:25:30 Daughter has booked an olive oil sommelier course in Tuscany. I think the glass ceiling of middleclassdom has been firmly smashed.
3231 2018-06-28 17:25:24 the oil industry didn't particularly want the us to invade iraq, though they did of course try to get as much out of it as they could
3232 2018-06-28 17:25:22 You have a lot on your plate. I’m sure stress isn’t helping. CBD oil has helped my daughter who has a rare autoimmune disease and went through years of abdomen pain. She is on the Ketogenic diet. Her disease can affect her kidneys. Good luck to you. 
3233 2018-06-28 17:25:22 Central government paid 2 lakh crores,oil loan made by upa government.This is nothing but ache din.
3234 2018-06-28 17:25:19 Huh. I looked it up and dandruff isnt from dry skin...? It’s actually produced by too much oil? Stress & poor diets containing high sugar can cause it too. It says to wash daily to reduce oil but scratch away the flakes before you shower! And a good hair exfoliant once a week.
3235 2018-06-28 17:25:11 行きたくなりそうだけどどうせ気持ちだけだから
3236 2018-06-28 17:25:10 and you also are somehow part of Oil Kings management, for some reason.
3237 2018-06-28 17:25:02 Big Oil, petrol companies are investing in electricity

2018 is the beginning of the end of petrol/diesel cars   


3238 2018-06-28 17:24:51 Small oil names getting thrown out now $PED $SDRL etc
3239 2018-06-28 17:24:46 BP want to make a profit. They can see what will soon happen to their oil business and are making arrangements to keep profitable. Polar chargers at BP garages means more chances to sell food & drink too.

3250 2018-06-28 17:23:49 Energy market went full blown bear market in 2015. Companies went belly up, balance sheets were purged. Those that survived are solid. The price of oil has nothing to do with the stregnth of an economy. It's about demand and they're not producing enough given future demand growth

3265 2018-06-28 17:22:07 Interesting, one source of revenue for Nigeria just finished. I hope oil will finish one day so that we can look inwards and build a real economy.

3282 2018-06-28 17:20:18 I think oil got bid with Iran sanction talk. The target date for full implementation I hear is Nov 4. Saudis are saying they will increase production. US inventories are lower...IMO overriding all that is proven reserves are abundant. (Recent huge find of Guyana)
3283 2018-06-28 17:20:14 Hope they didn't forget to change the oil, grease the wheels, etc...lol
3284 2018-06-28 17:20:08 To firm breasts and tighten the skin, mix one teaspoon of vitamin E oil with one tablespoon of yogurt and an egg.
3285 2018-06-28 17:20:07 Nothing? How convenient for you to forget that there have been 15+ indictments and 5 guilty pleas resulting from the investigation. Sell your snake oil elsewhere.
3286 2018-06-28 17:20:03 Trump manipulating works oil prices ahead of the mid-term elections... Grossly irresponsible to play silly whatsits with the world economy for his party's benefit... especially when we need to reduce oil consumption (by rising prices) to address climate change...

3299 2018-06-28 17:18:55 Ya'll... The secret is you've gotta coat the rice grains in a little bit of olive oil or veg oil. Then heat up the water separately & pour in the rice pot. Once it boils, turn down the heat to low. Then flip that rice over every 15-20 mins so it doesn't get mushy! 
3300 2018-06-28 17:18:49 I did that with OLIVE OIL once. I feel you.
3301 2018-06-28 17:18:49 By what metric? U.S. GDP growth is now more than double Canada’s. You ARE an energy exporter, I’ll give you that. But now that Trump has deregulated oil and coal, we will be too.

3307 2018-06-28 17:18:25 The only people exposed by trump are those who are stupid enough to believe this snake oil salesman. 

By the time he's finished you won't even own a pair of trousers
3308 2018-06-28 17:18:17 The decision to hand over the oil fields to the Benghazi administration will change the activity of the Libyan economy to the best and end the crisis of financial liquidity and the end of power and dominated by the militias
3309 2018-06-28 17:18:13 @walmarthelp I need some hydraulic oil for my Kubota tractor, UDT or super UDT rating.  What do you sell that works?

3311 2018-06-28 17:17:58 Walmart brand trail.mox - it's about 400 calories per serving. Naturslly I'd got for a higher quality trail mix. Also I'm a skinny guy that's gotta eat alot - 2 tbs olive oil and milk is a 450 calorie snack
3312 2018-06-28 17:17:51 By pulling out of the Iran deal you yielded all criticism of them.

You have helped russias economy by suppressing Iranian oil into the market.
3313 2018-06-28 17:17:16 Exactly. I’m sure that I told plenty of people that “we” would see to it that the charlatan was never elected. Does that make me guilty of some plot against the snake oil salesman? Absolutely. I plotted to vote, and to get other people to vote, too.
3314 2018-06-28 17:17:13 Over 30 chemicals in tanning oil are strict derivatives of acetyl nitrate, where as in sunscreen only less than 5 chemicals can be linked to flammability.
3315 2018-06-28 17:17:05 There are many photos of Justice Ginsburg in this very position.  One day she will croak and no one will realize until the next day when she is still there and someone says "Damn Ruth...You couldn't wait to get your favourite spot huh?" Dead

3318 2018-06-28 17:16:52 @cnn Let me guess at administration response: Russian oil will help bring down prices?
3319 2018-06-28 17:16:49 $68 for an oil change 
3320 2018-06-28 17:16:30 My mom keeps asking me why does my hair look wet, it’s not wet it’s the coconut oil that I can’t get out 
3321 2018-06-28 17:16:23 4th of July holiday stupid! Fuel prices always spike before and during a holiday. People are traveling and Big Oil is going to line their pockets. Been happening for years!

3323 2018-06-28 17:16:13 Jordan is an “ass” who thinks that if he talks louder and faster and mumbles that his air time will lead to his continued career aspirations.    Why don’t you just go sell snake oil with your “carny boss” at one of his sleazy hotels.  You’re an embarrassment.....
3324 2018-06-28 17:16:11 A3 Look for type of tuna and ingredients, water not oil #StarKistSelectsEVOO
3325 2018-06-28 17:16:02 Pat, I agree, and the economy will crash soon. All the signs are there: Inflated home prices, a false bubble in the stock market with inflated prices, rising oil prices, unsteady leadership imposing tariffs, not enough immigration to fill available jobs. Soon.
3326 2018-06-28 17:16:01 That’s why I used the (?). I’m not entirely convinced either but I’ve never noticed the bitterness myself from blended oil.
3327 2018-06-28 17:16:01 それパクろう…
3328 2018-06-28 17:16:00 Seems like the whole world is just waiting to get drilling...our little island is floating on oil, rich in minerals and forestry, I could go on...

We need to stop letting them give it all away.
3329 2018-06-28 17:15:53 Science might not lie, but politicians on the take from coal/oil certainly do about the science.
3330 2018-06-28 17:15:49 I grew up in the 90’s when it was completely fine up dose yourself in baby oil in the sun. Luckily I’ve grown out of that!
3331 2018-06-28 17:15:40 my dads always sending me videos of accidents that happen out in the oil field and geez they are never little always like always two 8 wheelers smushed and 1 rolled over or some crap!! so insane

3340 2018-06-28 17:14:56 Literally out here minding my own business, drinking water, moisturizing with coconut oil and reading One Piece like a good girl should and then the anime takes a 6 for a 9.  Let me go back about 5 episodes.
3341 2018-06-28 17:14:43 Would avoid buying oil stock, too risky.
Crude oil price expect to fall
3342 2018-06-28 17:14:39 a3 first would be what kind of liquid it is stored in. oil or water #StarKistSelectsEVOO
3343 2018-06-28 17:14:37 I guess the future generations of second hand cars will be buying cars with deficient batteries instead of oil leaks
3344 2018-06-28 17:14:20 This report is complete and utter garbage by a partisan organization funded, ironically, by many of the same organizations that are accused of interfering in the Canadian oil business via BC special interest groups. Happy to walk you through the real valuation logic.
3345 2018-06-28 17:14:09 ..yul was not doing bad, a quite successful retailer, but greed gripped him. He wanted an oil block to himself. He wanted to be called a dominicado as well... At d end, he lost everything..

3348 2018-06-28 17:13:25 I slept last night, haven't been sleeping right since 6+ months ago. 

But today I feel better, I found my multivitamins, so I took then along with my Norwegian cod liver oil. 

It's been a good day, today also marks one month since I've been in Kingston. 

Fish for lunch too.
3349 2018-06-28 17:13:18 Mad about the EPA? 
Want environmental justice? 
Los Angeles can ban oil drilling. We can act in our own cities.
3350 2018-06-28 17:13:15 I still have many questions. I think the garlic thing can help explain a large number of occurrences, but not all. There's still something else going on...could be the oil quality, could be the taster (maybe some ppl are more sensitive to this particular bitter taste?)
3351 2018-06-28 17:13:13 Yasjay you no well abi...? 
3352 2018-06-28 17:12:57 Oh no that’s ok. I get free oil changes, thanks tho

3356 2018-06-28 17:12:23 I’ve been pan searing lately. Light olive oil first. Light salt on both sides. Salt free garlic and herb seasoning. Garlic butter in the pan n cook it for about 3-5 minutes on each side. Butter gonna give it any salt it lacks from seasoning.
3357 2018-06-28 17:12:17 So you shower every two days and I’m the one with the problem?! He was like “you’re drying your skin out”. My Asian coworker was like “that’s what lotion and coconut oil is for”. And the white dude just shook his head at us and said we shower too much 
3358 2018-06-28 17:12:14 Trump thinks squeezing off supply from Iran will lower prices. He's been pressuring our allies to stop importing Iranian oil & violate the Iran agreement like he did. Dummy don't know less supply means higher prices.
3359 2018-06-28 17:12:04 I love dark skins like I’m talking my color or darker  like babyboy let me oil you up
3360 2018-06-28 17:11:54 Because Iran is producing less oil while the United States and other OPEC nations are wanting to produce more. Iran is lowering the supply thus the increase in price.
3361 2018-06-28 17:11:43 Suka gemes liat face oil
3362 2018-06-28 17:11:32 Fall in Re is in line with Other Asian currencies. Yuan & Russian Ruble.  It is triggered by Trump dictat on oil supply by Iran. With crude up there is also selloff in emerging markets. 

Just informing before many self styled economists like blame this on Modi
3363 2018-06-28 17:11:27 No. I am talking about homeopathy. Immunotherapy is not homeopathy. Homeopathic medicine is snake oil.

3399 2018-06-28 17:07:47 Not only has overall energy intensity of the economy decreased, the portion of energy from oil has decreased. Why should oil be different from other energy sources we've managed to replace throughout history?
3400 2018-06-28 17:07:43 Have they honored your rider in the past?  Do they comply with what the some might see as excessive requests for fresh papapaya juice, a gallon of baby oil, an inflatable pool and an alpaca?
3401 2018-06-28 17:07:43 Iran hasn't been treated fairly. 

They have been cut out of global oil supply. 

It's sworn enemy Saudi Arabia plans to increase to 11mb/d to replace the iranian crude.

Iran will hv depleted revenues, engage in a stalemate in Yemen, ehich ultimately lead to internal uprisings

3418 2018-06-28 17:06:04 Historical U.K. oil tax revenues covered a lot of our public services, having given the tax man £300bn by 2012. In theory we are richer as we haven’t had to pay for certain services as a result.

3442 2018-06-28 17:04:10 Sickening to see the lasting effects of imperialism on the beautiful Eden of the Congo. The co-optation of elites are furthering the reliance on oil by the Congolese, how can they survive without selling away their beauty?
3443 2018-06-28 17:04:10 This is awful people don’t think of anything but themselves destroying everything... these big oil companies don’t give a damn about the planet or it’s wildlife or people. Its all about the money and keeping those pockets full. It’s just disgusting....
3444 2018-06-28 17:04:01 "You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is like an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty." - Gandhi

3448 2018-06-28 17:03:45 @PiyushGoyal @PiyushGoyalOffc @arunjaitley @narendramodi Sir cars could be charged while it standby in office premises. Setup EV charging points @elonmusk this would cut down oil imports substantially.
3449 2018-06-28 17:03:41 Is this pricing oil in euros or yuan? Asking for an economic partner
3450 2018-06-28 17:03:41 @Lullah_elmiliji lol because u have never hammerd oil deal b4
3451 2018-06-28 17:03:40 A1.  Olive Oil, makes me feel like I'm making even more of a healthy choice after choosing tuna!  #StarKistSelectsEVOO

3459 2018-06-28 17:03:03 @jiffylube 12 days ago went for oil change, fluids, etc..  Wife went to use wiper wash while driving, nothing, checked fluid level, bone dry.  Never was filled.  Spent $104, and now wondering if ANY fluids were checked or if oil was even changed.  Not cool @jiffylube

3472 2018-06-28 17:02:07 I am a conservative, that does not agree with how Mr. Trump is running our country. I certainly hope it is not too late when people realize that the damage he is causing will hurt us all, our kids and g’kids etc. he is not working for us. Only himself and big oil
3473 2018-06-28 17:02:06 That’s pretty much what is the current trend. Also, data from exiting refineries cannot be extrapolated to new ones. And considering the energy potential of Mexico’s oil reserves there is a lot of leverage to get latest tech.
3474 2018-06-28 17:02:06 Such a great plant. My pain management started to work once I did my research. It was a blessing. CBD oil is the TROOF!!!!!!
3475 2018-06-28 17:02:03 You were burning the midnight oil, Jeff. Hope ok
3476 2018-06-28 17:02:02 I just can't understand with all that oil through the good years they had.  Why didn't they build their own oil refinery plant or plants? Oh that's right, higher ups stole the wealth of the Country instead of investing that wealth back into their own Country.

3478 2018-06-28 17:01:58 Disgraceful, appalling, pathetic. But Canadians just can’t seem to get enough government. From supply management and bloated milk prices to government car insurance in BC to liquor monopolies across the land, to a nationalized oil pipeline,you get the government you deserve.
3479 2018-06-28 17:01:57 @modernwest Kevin has no interest in seeing the emails we sent to him a few years back, care of a 'friend' who later told us he NEVER DID forward any of them because he 'knew' Kevin wouldn't be interested in anything we had to say (which involved oil well blowout technology)?
3480 2018-06-28 17:01:54 This will be the oil dealers ticket to start killing them ,and use it as an excuse to do horrible things..and lie like the gorillas are a threat , and they will murder them and their babies...all for some oil and money, THE  government there is just as greedy to allow this crap
3481 2018-06-28 17:01:51 I agree about banks and tech but the economy is clearly slowing so oil at $74 with us production going nuts is just plain wrong imo
3482 2018-06-28 17:01:51 Today, an important grade of Canadian oil #WCS, is selling for $20 USD less than the North American benchmark #WTI $72.37 USD

Canadian natural gas #AECO is selling for $1.22 CAD, yet US natural gas NYMEX is at $2.99 USD

3486 2018-06-28 17:01:32 By imposing sanctions on India because India is buying OIL from Iran.... Double Standard Country
3487 2018-06-28 17:01:23 Yeah I have seen.. It will just dissolve to oil especially when it's hot.

3493 2018-06-28 17:00:43 They did that for the fried food competition and everyone had oil that was already to temperature on their stoves.
3494 2018-06-28 17:00:39 Because it’s a competition. If someone gets to the fryer first, do what you do when the fryer goes out in a restaurant. You don’t stop serving fried food. You pan fry or set up a deep pot with some oil and a thermometer.

3513 2018-06-28 16:58:30 Oh and steam your face. Also cheap. Boil water and put it in a big pot and hold your face over it with a towel around your head. Throw some tea tree oil in there and sweat that shit out. THEN GRAB THE ICE. Your skin will call you daddy.
3514 2018-06-28 16:58:12 It will not take long before the EU & Russia become bedfellows.

3710 2018-06-28 16:39:14 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
3711 2018-06-28 16:39:12 800 lbs clothing out of landfills! That is quite a feat. Shows how small efforts can lead to big solutions. (Given that the garment industry is considered the 2nd most polluting in the world, after oil)
3712 2018-06-28 16:39:12 #Ethiopia is now started crude oil production.
3713 2018-06-28 16:39:00 BUT, Schuerger says current #Line3 is in “horrific condition and is deteriorating rapidly.” says reliability of oil delivery, and safety, would improve by replacing that line with a new one.

3718 2018-06-28 16:38:44 Oil @dbrand how do you clean a grip as mine got sticky somehow
3719 2018-06-28 16:38:15 CBD OIL should not be restricted in/on any sports team. If you’re unaware of what it is/what it does, look it up and do some research!!!
3720 2018-06-28 16:38:04 Another 26 cents fuel price hike next Wednesday. 

The government better listen to the people and do something about the ridiculous amounts added the fuel levy per litre before people take it to the streets.

Oil price is rising. 
The Rand is not doing so good.
3721 2018-06-28 16:38:02 The economy would he in a zombie-like state if the FED starts again with this gimmick, so I am not so convinced at all OIL (same thing for stocks) could have any reason to go that high.
3722 2018-06-28 16:38:01 He's the 21st century snake oil salesman, but instead of wonder cures he just pisses on your face while you cheer.
3723 2018-06-28 16:37:54 TJ tell ‘em! Earned not given. Bama ain’t like them Texas & Oklahoma schools who have BILLIONAIRE oil barons as boosters.
3724 2018-06-28 16:37:51 What will your neighbor do when Alberta can no longer process its own oil because they have regulated themselves out of petrol. Plan for the future now. Buy a bike
3725 2018-06-28 16:37:50 I can’t see flower being included, but products like gel caps, inhalers, bottles of oil are no brainers.

This is exciting.
3726 2018-06-28 16:37:46 Then use non-oil based skin care products para sa mga oily ang skin kasi mas magttrigger yung oil production ng balat natin

3729 2018-06-28 16:37:39 @realDonaldTrump way to manipulate oil anything to draw out the little people so you can hop on in for some huge ass run you say OPEC manipulates you manipulate your slogan should be let's f*** America on the little people so I can put more billions in my pocket
3730 2018-06-28 16:37:32 Dear peeps at @933kfm #HotSeat we as @GloriaSebikari 's fans are requesting that you sing her the happy birthday song after she has explained this oil business to us. End of request. Cc @benmwine @Akeda4

3732 2018-06-28 16:37:21 You could offer them everything they want and they would still say no. To many Americans protesting so they can keep their oil high.

3735 2018-06-28 16:36:52 After reading 12 articles on neem oil, I feel confident in how and when to apply it without doing any harm to bees and with hopes to annihilate the squash bugs I found today before they potentially ruin my remaining plants. Tomorrow at dawn, it’s on like Donkey Kong.
3736 2018-06-28 16:36:43 Tsaka tip ko rin hahahaha, maghilamos ng mukha every night and every morning. Or if you feel na medj nagooil yung mukha mo maghilamos ka para di mababad yung oil sa mukha mo which will produce some acne or pimples it can even clog your pores

3739 2018-06-28 16:36:27 That’s really good to know. I broke a bottle of olive oil in my girlfriend’s apartment and tried. The floor never recovered. We moved.
3740 2018-06-28 16:36:23 Latest from Greenpeace:

Mike Hudema blames evil oil companies for global warming us all out of a perfectly good ice age, ending the Pleistocene Epoch a few thousand years ago.

3742 2018-06-28 16:36:12 Apparently there’s oil in my voice 
3743 2018-06-28 16:36:07 3: DIY Moisturizer

- 1 tbs honey
- 1 tbs olive oil

- Mix them and rub on in circular motions doing a gentle message for 1-2 minutes.
3744 2018-06-28 16:36:07 I did this to a bottle of olive oil when I was V  drunk and the resulting clean up attempt was CATASTROPHIC and made everything 10 times worse. House should have just been condemned.

3749 2018-06-28 16:35:38 Commissioner Schuerger has not said for sure yet, but sounds like he may be leaning against finding a need for #Line3, says "MN refiners have been getting the oil they needed."  and says "the project as proposed will directly and adversely impact many of the tribes."
3750 2018-06-28 16:35:37 IF it ever gets built, a Liberal government will have total control of the only pipeline that gets Alberta oil to tidewater...

When they wrote the Constitution the life expectancy was what 50?
3755 2018-06-28 16:35:17 @HalftimeReport so @POTUS why is the OIL INDUSTRY the only industry in the world allowed to collude on price fixing Along with the help of WALL ST, CNBC, FOX BUSINESS, and  BLOOMBERG to screw us all and raise gasoline prices? And be happy about screwing us onTV
3756 2018-06-28 16:35:11 Well, let's see. Storing CO2 in oil fields means storing it w/o over-pressurization in formations that've held their contents for eons. Storing it in saline formations means putting it much deeper.  What has ever escaped to the surface from such formations? Nothing.
3757 2018-06-28 16:34:52 Why nobody talks about whole world currency being hit due to crude oil crisis ?
3758 2018-06-28 16:34:48 LMAO I mean, it was a DIY one I made, so just oil, water, food colouring and alka seltzer, but she has a STRONG stomach let me tell you. There’s been sand, playdough, grass, paint and all sorts in there 
3759 2018-06-28 16:34:46 Think about your comment as you stand at the gas pump filling your tank. 

Or, rather than words you can take action by discontinuing use of oil gas.

3763 2018-06-28 16:34:25 Is it true that oily skin should never be moisturized? Absolutely not. In fact, skin often produces excess oil because it is too dry. To moisturize and improve the health of oily skin, try using a water-based moisturizer twice a day.

3772 2018-06-28 16:33:31 It won't! Perhaps the shadow Energy Minister should move her residence downwind from a new refinery or an oil fuel-burning power central. Talk is cheap, ain't it?

3776 2018-06-28 16:33:15 Reading nutrition labels is important. Even “healthy” foods have tricky ingredients! For example, hydrogenated oil = trans-fat, evaporated cane juice = sugar, and regarding chemicals, stick with the mantra, “If you can’t read it, don’t eat it!” -MB

3803 2018-06-28 16:31:00 I agree with you on this to some extent. But surely the govt should push through reforms to the use of oil/petrol and hopefully that will lead to planes travelling using for eg hydrocarbons

3842 2018-06-28 16:26:58 That's Dr. Conagher. I worked 10 years in the Texan Oil Fields & Earned 11 PhDs on the side. I'm pretty sure 1 of them is in kicking your tail City Girl. I admit chess did seem a bit unfair of me. How about a middle ground with a Strategy War Game like Command & Conquer Generals?
3843 2018-06-28 16:26:58 We had a similar situation in 1997, a charismatic snake oil salesman who promised, and delivered - until the money ran out .. always amazes me that so many of my countrymen still believe those were the ‘good’ days 
3844 2018-06-28 16:26:57 Velocity market condition underway in oil. Correction will be sharp. Velocity=speculative market imho
3845 2018-06-28 16:26:57 I want to remind everyone that Cushing has more than 300 tanks. Taylor on Energy Investing board posted that there is sludge in the bottom that will not meet specs. My guesstimate is Cushing has 10-15 MM barrels of oil left while sludge numbers elevate the inventory.
3846 2018-06-28 16:26:51 If I were the Oil G.M., here are three players to target. Jay Beagle, Scott Hartwell, and Ryan Reeves. Who is going to protect Mcjesus? Lucic? Lol. #Oilers #oilcountry #NHL #tsnfreeagentfrenzy #FreeAgentFrenzy

3848 2018-06-28 16:26:26 That's some huge news, really good to see large oil companies seeing where there future is heading
3849 2018-06-28 16:26:24 Noticed this the other day when I made your garlic aioli, didn't blend in olive oil, but holy cow was it bitter.
3850 2018-06-28 16:26:22 just wanna highlight, what he says he dah prove niat first dia. Then, he make me fell bukan dengan rupa ( dulu dengan sekarang, sekarang muka dia teruk sebb kerja macam tu expose to oil, dust and so on) tapi dengan kesungguhan and 360s ddegree of changes
3851 2018-06-28 16:26:19 hulu... just let me watch community in peace. You dang well know nobody in my generation has any money to invest in anything like the white son of an oil magnate...

3853 2018-06-28 16:26:15 Hi B in case of. Oil be no can 
3854 2018-06-28 16:26:11 Is it just me or is olive oil vastly better than pretty much any other cooking oil?
3855 2018-06-28 16:26:11 The two main variables for the gas price are oil prices and taxes.
Also, gas in Mexico isn't expensive, in fact is below the average price.
Building refineries with public money is irresponsable at least.
3856 2018-06-28 16:26:06 Sams Always come in here with that dirty ass air filter talking about a new one . BITCH if you don’t change that damn oil & quit messing with my shit
3857 2018-06-28 16:25:41 Try CBD oil. It's legal in all 50 states. I also have chronic pain from fibromyalgia, lupus, bulging discs and more. CBD oil also works for anxiety and arthritis, which I also have.
3858 2018-06-28 16:25:36 มีมาร์คไหมค่ะ
3859 2018-06-28 16:25:36 It just came to my head that a few months ago. I bought this bear growth oil. Where is that jawn
3860 2018-06-28 16:25:35 OKC: the eastbound I-240 off-ramp to Bryant Ave. is closed to clean up an oil spill. This closure is expected to last through the lunch hour. Drivers should locate an alternate route.

3863 2018-06-28 16:25:06 Made these many times with good results using a Lodge press. Works best for me if I oil it first so it doesn't stick to the meat (disaster)
3864 2018-06-28 16:24:59 Oil billionaires by ethics must promote diverse energies
3865 2018-06-28 16:24:58 I’d be shy n all if my arse looked like two beat up oil drums
3866 2018-06-28 16:24:35 Salad Dressing is where its at. There's nothing quite like that adrenaline you get when you know you have an after lunch meeting and you still go ahead with the oil & vinegar dressing.
3867 2018-06-28 16:24:35 I totally agree, @essvalservices. However, Rose Geranium essential oil is safe to use on dogs in small quantities. Much safer than the dog being exposed to possible Lyme disease and co-infections too!
3868 2018-06-28 16:24:30 "What do you mean its leaking oil from the exhaust"
3869 2018-06-28 16:24:17 Cantu colored treated shampoo and conditioner, olive oil, tea tree oil, eco, & beeswax 
3870 2018-06-28 16:24:17 Brushing will pull up any dead hair/skin & distribute natural oil throughout the coat. Soft bristles are gentle on the underside of dogs.
3871 2018-06-28 16:24:15 Deficits + trade war + minimum tax cuts for majority of consumers + rising oil prices + rising interest rates = inflation and recession

3881 2018-06-28 16:23:46 Turkana people are talking and they are talking in the right way. Security for the oil is now available in plenty but non has been availed to the community's other challenges like cattle rustling.

3888 2018-06-28 16:23:25 Those are gorgeous! Forgot to add, rub them with olive oil before you spice!

3901 2018-06-28 16:21:54 $tga Transglobe Energy doing very nicely today, IPO on the London Aim Exchange tomorrow, producing over 15kboepd (over 90% oil) and cashflow over $60m per annum. Mkt cap only 140m. Tomorrow will be interesting..

3912 2018-06-28 16:21:31 You rich SOBs have driven up everything else so why not oil!?
3913 2018-06-28 16:21:27 Most medical sources say 1/2 of young adults have demodex mites, 2/3 middle aged folks, and 100% of people over 70 have them. Usually don’t cause problems, but if you have a bunch of them they contributed to dry eye/irritation cause they mess with oil glands and tear ducts

3915 2018-06-28 16:21:15 @essvalservices, Rose Geranium essential oil is, in fact, one of the few essential oils that you CAN use without a carrier oil.
3916 2018-06-28 16:21:11 #RupeeInICU crude oil will cost above 130 dollars soon that maybe OK but maybe rupee will also cost above 100 dollars soon  too !!! Unless Nation works like 'Bapuji' and forgets playing around our beloved Pappooji...also diesel #Engineers should look for alternative fuels now.

3918 2018-06-28 16:21:04 It amazes how some guys can’t even do a simple oil change on their cars and would rather pay 
3919 2018-06-28 16:21:01 @OcasioCortez Please tells us why Venezuela, wealthy with oil as it is, is having such a problem feeding her people?  Why is their inflation rate so high?  What would you do to fix their problem?

3931 2018-06-28 16:19:36 My office was a holding area for auction items.  Didn’t notice the huge glass vase filled with olive oil and peppers was cracked when I went to move it a smidge.  I had to leave and come back a few times to figure out what the next plan of action would be
3932 2018-06-28 16:19:35 Now for them Oil is gain which used to be pain .
3933 2018-06-28 16:19:33 I think i’m the only one that puts a little bit on coconut oil on my eyelashes.
3934 2018-06-28 16:19:23 No one has come forth and threatened to use force to prevent shipments from the ports. This will be absolutely necessary if as is likely the Benghazi NOC sells some oil. It is already offering below market prices a sign that it may have problems.

3938 2018-06-28 16:19:13 Thanks for the info but I truly don't believe any of that will happen in the near future. Saudi Arabia sets the oil prices & it's holding. I'm a survivalist, so the tips were quaint, but minimal in comparison to what would truly be necessary if anything catastrophic happened.
3939 2018-06-28 16:19:07 There obviously has to be a better way of wealth distribution. We've got plenty of oil here in the south and the water flows from here too. We certainly are getting the shitty end of the stick.

3989 2018-06-28 16:15:00 Oil Prices rose but supply remained tight with investors concerned by the prospect of a big fall in crude exports from Iran due to U.S. sanctions
3990 2018-06-28 16:14:58 Just as delicious as you'd imagine it would be. Grilled to perfection, and had it with some divine olive oil over it, paired with a master-piece bottle of wine.
One of the coolest meals of my life. And not just because I caught it, honestly :
3991 2018-06-28 16:14:58 dude i totally understand, the way i used to use dry shampoo is i would spray it on and rub it into my roots and scalp with my fingers, just so it could absorb the oil

4001 2018-06-28 16:14:06 Tullow Oil raised its outlook on production guidance for 2018 on expectations for an increase in daily oil production
4002 2018-06-28 16:14:01 Wood Group maintained its full-year outlook as the oil and gas market steadied in the first half. The company said it expects to deliver first-half revenue of close to $5.1bn to $5.2bn and earnings (EBITA) between a $250m to $260m range
4003 2018-06-28 16:13:50 It's kind of like there's been improvement since the global oil price crash while NDP held Alberta government. What's it that one opposition party keeps trying to tell us again?

4121 2018-06-28 16:02:29 thank you!!! It’s been forever since I’ve done an oil painting so I’m glad you think so djdhfhf
4122 2018-06-28 16:02:23 Nazis aren't and never were any different from any other Communists/Socialists.

This dipstick Mexico chose is already talking about nationalizing the oil industry. Mexico will be Venezuela. Great, I'm sure that will improve conditions for the Mexican people.
4123 2018-06-28 16:02:21 おじさんなんだからむりしないでくださいね...!!!
4124 2018-06-28 16:02:13 I couldn’t find my peace&calming oil, and I don’t have Valor right now. So I’ve been anxious because I use it for emotional support, and I just found it and I am so happy just sitting here smelling it 
4125 2018-06-28 16:02:05 Grilled Corn with Lime Essential Oil - am willing to go out of the 'comfort zone' and try that! Sounds interesting!
4126 2018-06-28 16:02:04 Rather than route out government corruption and focusing on reducing crime. That seems like the most advantantageous for México and therefor in the public interest. Venezuela tried to protect its oil prices and took away democracy. Democracy is the only opposite of dictatorship.

4128 2018-06-28 16:01:58 /2/, it will mean our export goods will become cheaper, so more export goods will be sold, so higher forex reserve for India. This forex reserve is used by GOI to buy crude oil in USD. Now if rupee is appreciated, similarly export goods will become expensive and lead to lowersale

4133 2018-06-28 16:01:45 It's ok to not be a fan of the Oil and hate on everyone but don't be an idiot about it. 

Drai since becoming a main stay NHLer - 51, 77, 71 pts

Jack - 56, 57, 64 pts 

You're bringing Drai down because of 30 games he played in 14/15 where he wasn't even ready.
4134 2018-06-28 16:01:42 Small country with oil needs big stick! Especially if it is independent!  Do you think it is someone elses responsibility to ensure our safety?
4135 2018-06-28 16:01:40 いやわかる、わかります。あれが最善ということも。ポーランドは3連敗を免れてWIN、日本も決勝トーナメント進出でWINだと。そして日本は贅沢言える立場でもないこと。そして結果的に主力温存出来たことも西野の思惑通りなことも。
それでも、なんか釈然としないですよねぇ。
4136 2018-06-28 16:01:39 @BashirElRufai Agbaya! If you were raised with Groundnut pyramid money instead of crude oil you for get sense.
4137 2018-06-28 16:01:33 You don’t need oil to fry chicken
4138 2018-06-28 16:01:30 Governor, we do not usually respect liars, spin doctors, or snake oil salesmen/women.  If someone is burning down your house  do you ask them politely to stop.  Your President  does not show respect for others or our Democracy, he therefore should receive none....

4146 2018-06-28 16:00:51 Look at crude oil -- when it made a 10-year low in 2016, would you have wished to have bought it at $26? It's currently trading at $73.

4150 2018-06-28 16:00:29 I'm big into oil. I own lots of it and I know what it smells like. It's rich smelling. The smell itself spawns property and mansions.
4151 2018-06-28 16:00:24 I heard @scotthortonshow say the U.S. spends more on the wars than it does on Middle Eastern oil, so I decided to do the math. [thread]
4152 2018-06-28 16:00:19 最近頭の中に「信じろ！」という言葉が浮かびまくり、その度になんとなく共感のような感覚があるが、何を信じるのかはさっぱりわからない
4153 2018-06-28 16:00:17 i put bio oil on my stretch marks and they turned into a scratch and they’ve been bleeding i just want to crY
4154 2018-06-28 16:00:17 Bitch. Tea tree oil on the scalp? *chef kiss* it’s a like a million tiny hands scratching my angry dry skin.
4155 2018-06-28 16:00:15 Genesis 4:2 And Shem and Japheth took a vial of oil, the increase of the north, and from Judaea, And from Betah, and from the streets
4156 2018-06-28 16:00:11 I was going to comment the same, but you guys are way ahead. We the west have been 'intervening' illegally since this whole sham started. If we'd stop 'Intervening' the country could return to peace.. but oil, gas, geo politics.. usual western targets
4157 2018-06-28 16:00:08 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
4158 2018-06-28 16:00:06 Israel with its levithian gas and oil is also a new player in the market. Will it fill the gab?
4159 2018-06-28 16:00:06 Boil some oil
4160 2018-06-28 16:00:05 Relax, it doesn't need an economist to understand it. First few facts, our imports are more than exports in value terms. Also our imports are dire for our economy as it major part of it is crude oil. So imports can't be cut down substantially. 

Now if rupee gets devaluated,
4161 2018-06-28 15:59:59 Actually they do, it’s just they haven’t left the oil rig yet

@GhassanSalame @UNSMILibya  Well done , enjoy the oil !
4164 2018-06-28 15:59:50 The jackass they elected is already poised to nationalize the oil industry. You know, the ONLY freaking thing Mexico has going for it.

Mexico: Venezuela looks great, let's do exactly that & elect a Socialist!
4165 2018-06-28 15:59:42 Analysis: Saudi-Russian axis rules oil markets as Trump fights Iran: DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Iran may be Russia's ally in the Syrian conflict but when it comes to oil, Tehran's arch-enemy Saudi Arabia takes precedence - if last week's OPEC meeting in Vienna is anything to go by.

4169 2018-06-28 15:58:58 Not that I know of but it makes no sense considering where oil went and where sargassum is coming from.
4170 2018-06-28 15:58:55 6/27/18. India rupee sinks to its lowest level against the dollar, hurt by rising oil prices, declining foreign capital, and deficits.

4178 2018-06-28 15:58:30 Any concede that, oil crashed, economy crashed at same time. A majority of these govt issues from that article are due to federal policies from Harper govt days. Liberals carbon tax yet to be implemented so I’m not going to speculate on what that will do.
4179 2018-06-28 15:58:23 The #Trump Administration is discussing with its allies in the Middle East in order to avoid a negative impact of US sanctions against #Iran on world oil supply. By allies the State Department means Saudi Arabia in particular

4189 2018-06-28 15:57:42 Would u.s will provide oil to india in same price as iran! 
    Also u.s should also ban all its relationship and business with pakistan for the same reason!

4204 2018-06-28 15:55:37 Persecution is having your head cut off or put into boiling oil, like with the Apostles. In not persecuted. But I'd gladly die if it would mean you hearing how to be saved from your sins. That's what true love is.

4210 2018-06-28 15:55:20 Our SER Monthly was released yesterday and we discuss the recent rise in oil prices: the hype versus the reality. We remain crude oil bears.
4211 2018-06-28 15:55:19 US has given Ultimatum to stop oil trade with Iran Who the hell is Trump to dictate terms with India .Bring sanctions against America .Stop trade with America Indians became Posh recently .Let us have our culture and live as Bharathians

4215 2018-06-28 15:55:09 I want to be on record predicting he will give Putin the Exxon oil deal either by exemption to, or elimination of relative sanctions. He will cite OPEC, national security, and economy. Look for more tweets complaining about OPEC coming soon.
4216 2018-06-28 15:55:08 The oil, coal, and gas industries send their deepest thanks

this one used to be a big mover!
4218 2018-06-28 15:54:48 It's too late for the voters to fix it.  The Trumpists will install another right wing extremist on the Supreme Court cementing a permanent and unassailable far right majority.  It's gone too far for the mid terms to fix.  The slippery slope has been coated with oil.

4227 2018-06-28 15:54:10 Right? Trump should have stroked out years ago. He has to have pure fry oil running through his veins at this point. He should be careful around open flames.
4228 2018-06-28 15:54:05 Of course d #bluesky in d background reminds me of my wife my @BrookeBCNN's heavenly/beautiful #blueeyes & hard to believe tomorrow 6/29/18 d 3 year anniversary of my 6/29/15 missive to my wife & she did d "miracle of d oil" showed me SPECIAL4 that summer of 2015
4229 2018-06-28 15:53:47 I don't mind that. I think of it like how my car needs the more expensive oil. It's a good car, it's reliable but it needs this particular thing to keep going. I've just been through so much misdiagnosis/wrong meds that I was afraid to believe something was working.

4241 2018-06-28 15:52:38 Hmm great. So now I will be supporting an oil company when I charge at you devices. Guess I will just stick to ecotricity from now on.
4242 2018-06-28 15:52:31 We had a trail detail here in northwest Iowa. It was carrying crude oil and it’s now in the rock river. EPA response is ridiculous. The spill may not be contained.
4243 2018-06-28 15:52:12 The cost of Oil is controlled in part by OPEC and others(Trump recently prodded them to increase production by 1mil barrels/day)-if not for US emergence as a viable player we would be spending much more at the pump for gasoline-we are keeping the world market in line..
4244 2018-06-28 15:52:10 There are fewer things more uncomfortable than getting an oil change and having the guy show you the dipstick afterwards. What the hell am supposed to say to that?

4246 2018-06-28 15:52:06 I pour olive oil over each serving of my dogs foo! It helps decrease shedding and gives their coat a silky look!
4247 2018-06-28 15:51:42 But just tell me what are you going to do to save America's monuments parks Etc? Trump has already cut One National Monument down to 13% of what it once was so the oil and gas people can tear the whole place up. Or maybe it's copper?
4248 2018-06-28 15:51:34 Dique “I don’t need oil or enough water to cook rice”  He’d end up wasting most of it, so his sister told us about the rice cooker, which is foolproof.

4250 2018-06-28 15:51:30 Well they had a free and fair democracy but do you know who took that away? No the current government, the CIA and MI6 along side the oil companies.

4254 2018-06-28 15:51:02 You said it would be subject to an FTA. I said it wouldn’t be and neither of you disagreed. And if we’re desperate for Aussie oil after Brexit, we’re all fucked.
4255 2018-06-28 15:51:00 Who made #America #USA to decide from where #India should buy crude oil !! You people see your home affairs,  don't scratch on Indians. #IOC #HP #BP #RELIANCE
4256 2018-06-28 15:50:59 I know that feel. My car was like “oh cool, WE got our tax return, I think MY oil is leaking”.
4257 2018-06-28 15:50:58 oil changes, mostly, right?
4258 2018-06-28 15:50:46 Maybe being made in the EU they won't leak oil.
4259 2018-06-28 15:50:43 Fantastic boon to big oil, hastened demise of trains.
4260 2018-06-28 15:50:31 It means that the public doesn't buy normal Republican bullshit anymore but they will still buy the type of bullshit sold by a snake oil salesman.

And so do you.

4263 2018-06-28 15:50:19 An admirable move from a big oil company. Let's hope it was done with the right motives.

4266 2018-06-28 15:49:51 I wanna short oil so bad here, but also I know that OPEC+ exports will lower the arb, even from here, and timespreads in WTI are pushed up cause of Syncrude.  Not until its $3 at least
4267 2018-06-28 15:49:32 I think oil will follow lower but have no idea how much higher it will go first

4271 2018-06-28 15:49:06 Don’t forget steadily rising price of oil (which statistically tends to precede recession), and record high aggregate household debt as well. Just seems unlikely (though not impossible) the expansion keeps on going for years under these circumstances...

4290 2018-06-28 15:48:07 Oh I agree! But Mr Plumm’s argument that Israel was chosen by the Jews because they thought oil and gas were there is ridiculous. That was their historic homeland and no matter what was on it or underneath it, only Israel is what they longed for.

4294 2018-06-28 15:47:59 Once came home to a half gallon of olive oil, 1 liter of vinegar, and a bottle of margarita mix all smashed on the floor along with the shelf they were on. Considered moving states.

4303 2018-06-28 15:46:52 Suspending those remittances for a time could encourage Mexico not to allow their country to be a conduit for illegal migration, human trafficking and drug trafficking. Some estimate the value of those remittances to be larger than the profits on their oil industry.
4304 2018-06-28 15:46:49 Is India going to be colony of America? Dictating terms on business? Why should India listen to America for not importing oil from Iran? Is this the reason 2+2 meeting was cancelled between India and US?
4305 2018-06-28 15:46:49 It Figures, Just a snake oil salesman
4306 2018-06-28 15:46:46 I didn't know about the olive oil mishap until I returned; perhaps the housesitter was afraid I wouldn't return if she told me before I got back, which, I have to say, is not an unreasonable fear.

4315 2018-06-28 15:46:16 Reminds me of an investment i made in Puntland (Somalia) many moons ago, if there is enough oil it wont be long before tribal warfare breaks out.
4316 2018-06-28 15:46:11 Yup. And New York's crime level is at historic lows. But right wingers and facts mix as well together as oil and water
4317 2018-06-28 15:46:09 I just turned 105k miles on my 2010 Prius...only had oil changes every 5k miles and two sets of tires. Not even a brake job there is still about 40% left.
4318 2018-06-28 15:46:08 Yep. Put the oil in her hands and let her know not to be lazy
4319 2018-06-28 15:46:06 Sauté your veggies! Cut up zucchini, squash, and potatoes. Put them in a pan, add water or broth instead of oil, and cook them on your stove top.

4321 2018-06-28 15:46:02 That's a great analogy too. Can you imagine if the price of an oil change was $1000 if you didn't have insurance? That's what we have in healthcare now...

4349 2018-06-28 15:43:17 Just curious, but do these off-grid people know that all solar powered items are made with petroleum products in one form or another? So, they are, by choice, supporting the oil & gas industry.  I just thought this nay clariftpy exactly what hypocrisy looks like.

4661 2018-06-28 15:19:21 Iran may be Russia's ally in the Syrian conflict but when it comes to oil, Tehran's arch-enemy Saudi Arabia takes precedence - if last week's OPEC meeting in Vienna is anything to go by. @Reuters
4662 2018-06-28 15:19:14 Based on that analogy of "when one finger touches oil, ..."  should Igbos have been declared terrorists and not IPOB?

"Fulani" is a tribe,  "herding" is an occupation thus both cannot be declared as terrorists. 

Such declaration can only pour fuel on the crisis.
4663 2018-06-28 15:19:12 But you have potential Iran sanctions hit + Venezuela + Lybia + low spare capacity. Why not to short lets say iron ore instead of  oil?
4664 2018-06-28 15:19:12 It's a good setup tbh, because rn it's basically

4684 2018-06-28 15:17:30 What was different in 2013 - read up on taper tantrum and look up spike in oil prices then. Isn't it hypocritical to criticize a government for a perceived failing and subsequently keep shut when a similar thing happens under a govt that you favor?
4685 2018-06-28 15:17:27 What exactly did @jkenney accomplish for Alberta's oil and gas sector? He failed to get a pipeline built to tidewater. He taxed income trusts. And—he attempted to sabotage a $15.1 billion energy deal. #ableg #abpoli #cdnpoli

4726 2018-06-28 15:14:22 #WTI – 76.50 is the 61.8% retrace of the entire move down from the June 2014 peak of 107.68 to the Feb 2016 low of 26.05. Using the prior high of 114.83 in May 2011, we get ~81 as the 61.8% retrace. So my target for the peak in Oil before it crashes is 76.50-81. Just an FYI.

4799 2018-06-28 15:06:49 Ok, last try. Between summer 2014 to early 2016 when oil prices collapsed from $105 to $26 global supply was exceeded global demand by 1.4 million barrels per day. During the rally from 2016 through May 2018 demand has exceeded supply by 200,000 barrels per day.

4801 2018-06-28 15:06:37 Energy efficiency will not improve oil deficit significantly as demand will rise substantially as spending power increases.Same with electronics.
Gold deficit could go lower as faith in economy and choices of investment increase,but not much.
Only option is to be prepared to pay.

4820 2018-06-28 15:04:59 Venezuela actually has more oil reserves per population than Norway (30k barrels/person vs 4k barrels/person).

If Norway was actually socialist, it would look like Venezuela.  Either that or it is headed the way of Venezuela in due time.

But again, I'm preaching to the choir.
4821 2018-06-28 15:04:53 won't they offshore a lot of their risk with this ARAMCO IPO?  The incentive for oil to hover around $70-$80/bbl for all producers would be large.  (Sorry Iran and Venezuela!).

4870 2018-06-28 15:02:00 so I have a story time: a couple of days ago, I took a bath. I read that if you put coconut oil in a hot bath, it softens the water and your skin. So I was like hell yeah and threw in a couple handfuls. Not gonna lie the bath WAS heavenly BUT... things went south fast.

4923 2018-06-28 14:57:51 Today, Indian #Rupee touched record low against the US #Dollar. The trend is similar with other Asian currencies.      However, unlike many of its Asian counterparts that have +ve trade balances, India will suffer more as it heavily depends on imports, especially oil. #RupeeInICU

Not at the expense of the human race?

4981 2018-06-28 14:52:16 @JosefSchachter Very high oil prices today. When will the "battle for $60.00 commence"? How powerful is the US sanction action on Iran?

5004 2018-06-28 14:50:16 At no point should you ever use an essential oil 'neat'. It is a highly concentrated chemical solvent that can and will cause chemical burns. This is a dangerous practice, and advocating for it opens you up to potential lawsuits.

5049 2018-06-28 14:46:53 Climate change requires radical change, but libertarians (50% of the US) views tax and spend as more of the same. The solution a majority would vote for is only radical because you did not think of it: retract big oil’s business license.

5055 2018-06-28 14:46:17 Government bond prices ended lower today as the weakness in the Rupee heightened fears of a rate hike by RBI at a faster-than-expected pace. Rise in crude oil prices also weighed on bond prices. The yield on 10-year G-sec ended at 7.93% vs. yesterday’s close of 7.87%.

5072 2018-06-28 14:45:16 It is interesting How the story changed in the last two years, from Shale is the new revolution, OPEC is irrelevant & Oil is dead to the current state as the U.S President asked OPEC to increase oil supply to lower the prices..
5073 2018-06-28 14:45:10 This is a blatant lie.  @Fahrenthold won a pulitizer for exposing just how LITTLE actually went to Charity.  You cannot pay FINES thru charity, you cannot make political donations via a charity, you cannot buy oil paintings of yourself, OR footballs or Boy Scout dues.  It’s fraud

5096 2018-06-28 14:43:42 Its because they need Crimea to run the pipelines through to get Putin's $500 billion worth of oil out of Russia. Only reason Putin chose trump to be pres. Knowing he'll play along & get Obamas sanctions removed.

5103 2018-06-28 14:43:09 Climate change requires radical change, but libertarians (50% of the US) views tax and spend as more of the same. The solution a majority would vote for is only radical because you did not think of it: retract big oil’s business license.
5104 2018-06-28 14:43:09 Here's How it Will Affect You
The weakening rupee will make crude oil, fertilisers, medicines and iron ore, which India imports in large quantities, costlier. Though these items are not for your daily consumption, they impact your finances indirectly.

5161 2018-06-28 14:39:09 so:
1. collect that $3B
2. stop the $3B going to oil subsidies
3. cancel the $4.5B ++ for the pipeline

then, invest $10.5B ++ in a renewable energy strategy. we'd crush unemployment, tackle CO2 emissions & improve indigenous relations.

5198 2018-06-28 14:36:13 Mr.G, looking at the oil market, it seems to be driven by the gasoline market. looking at a short at 73.4 but the gasoline just pushed it up. I thought gasoline should be dropping now.

5235 2018-06-28 14:33:36 Here is a question that has to be answered.
Our nation is shipping oil out of our shore but we have to pay the Saudi’s extra when they cut back on production, WHY?
If we have enough oil to sell, why not keep it and drive the price down?
Just seems weird.

5243 2018-06-28 14:32:43 When oil prices were down, economy started doing well and trade deficit fell, the same Rahul G said what has Modi done, it’s because of falling oil prices. Now that crude is up, the Rascal is blaming Modi ji. Utter rubbish of a man!

5345 2018-06-28 14:25:52 If the argument from Kenney is that royalty revenue should not be part of equalization (btw, no reason given), then how come he thinks it’s think it’s ok to take royalty money that derives from under oil sands land and spend it on health care else in Alberta?

Unlike Chavez/maduro and other leftist governments who relied too heavily on overspending from oil/resource wealth, she smartly invested their copper wealth
5355 2018-06-28 14:25:25 Oh, he’s a big problem here on so many levels. Trudeau should take the lead from his Chinese buddies and treat Trump’s massive ego with deference and respect. We’re an ant here. If we had trade deals all over the world and our oil could get to tidewater I’d be more aggressive but
5356 2018-06-28 14:25:22 Let me go get this oil change before I have to go to work 
5357 2018-06-28 14:25:22 I also started using a facial oil beforehand, underneath my moisturizer, so my skin is more hydrated & it produces less oil to begin with. but definitely pack on the setting powder & let it bake for a while before doing anything else. my makeup stays ALL day now!

5364 2018-06-28 14:24:59 I am surprised by the fact that the news of Ethiopia producing crude oil hasn't attracted the attention of international mainstream media, given that the world, especially advanced economies, are always thirsty for oil and even wage a war for it.
5365 2018-06-28 14:24:44 The same criteria could have been used in UPA time. In fact there was much more pressure coz oil was beyond $120.
5366 2018-06-28 14:24:43 I don't think so. The state will evolve - like Armenia - as a new tech-savvy generation takes over.... but it won't fail. Few in Iran are willing & able to destroy oil infrastructure. Iran is long past religious ideology & pro capital. You don't get suicide bombing for profit

5375 2018-06-28 14:24:12 Turkey should also be forced to not crush Iran's oil.

5394 2018-06-28 14:23:04 Noooo definitely not. If necessary use it and wash ur face twice after with cleanser! Oil of any kind clogs your pores and will make you break out, and depending on your skin type will normally dry you out

5476 2018-06-28 14:15:28 Yeah, Collin's right. Nothing socialist about state run oil companies, expropriating local and foreign owned private businesses, price controls, rationing, state handouts to the populace that drive up inflation, etc.
5477 2018-06-28 14:15:26 Apparently you’re so blinded by your Trump Derangement™ that you missed the fact that the administration has reimposed significant sanctions on Iran and is taking steps to choke off their oil exports, but please tell me more about how we’re allies...

5490 2018-06-28 14:14:11 Please create a super invention board not UGC tampering in election year. India needs techs to reduce 2lakh crore oil, 60k fertilizer,45billion China import. Every with global New tech get funded. Tech not rote.
5491 2018-06-28 14:14:07 He doesn’t vote with Dems all the time. He voted against Russian sanctions, against background checks for gun purchases. He’s just another snake oil salesman like trump. And his followers are just as blind as red hat Trumpsters.

5495 2018-06-28 14:13:54 My tinfoil hat theory of the week is that 45 has been directed by Vlad to sever ties with the West, and drive the US economy to the point where only Russian oil money can bail it out

5497 2018-06-28 14:13:45 ほんとそれ
5498 2018-06-28 14:13:36 There's an obvious reason why it is a case of #RupeeInICU. India is importing far more, esp oil, than it is exporting.
5499 2018-06-28 14:13:32 I love and respect old people but if you can’t even stay awake you shouldn’t be able to make a decision on a case and I’ve seen dozens of instances where she’s asleep
5500 2018-06-28 14:13:31 $xeg is really lagging oil futures, all that nat gas abundance. Pffff!
5501 2018-06-28 14:13:29 Yep. Can’t accurately predict the weather either. Snake oil.
5502 2018-06-28 14:13:28 TJ's videos of him pouring hot oil on his ass are way more real than the joke videos that show him getting kicked out of chain restaurants. Lol get real

5504 2018-06-28 14:13:13 Now let's bring on a representative of the oil industry to present "both sides" of the debate.
5505 2018-06-28 14:13:11 プロ初勝利おめでとう
5506 2018-06-28 14:12:56 @JasonGregor did you see Chiarelli introducing the Oil Kings GM yesterday? This close to July 1 and the Oilers *STILL* have him focusing on Oil Kings stuff? Does anything ever change with this organization? Sooooo frustrating.
5507 2018-06-28 14:12:50 #Libya Bread Crisis

The direct cause of BIG spikes in prices of flour, oil and other basic food commodities is not the black market price increases, oil crescent events, or fuel price increases. 
It is due to SHORTAGES from lack of LCs to Stabilisation Fund (Food subsidy agency)
5508 2018-06-28 14:12:48 One additional date Daniel - 1974 and Kissinger's agreement with OPEC to price oil exclusively in USD: PetroDollar. Further entrenched daily need for dollars globally.
5509 2018-06-28 14:12:42 Indian Rupee lost all it's glory today plummeting to it's lowest value ever, crossing 69 to a dollar, this is bad for Indian economy and the general population at we are dependent on international products like crude oil, palm oil, pulses among other things. #RupeeInICU
5510 2018-06-28 14:12:40 Sweet Almond Oil is a very luxurious oil for everything in soaps, creams, body butters, sugar scrubs.   It’s great on the skin and easily absorbed so it won’t sit on your skin for a long time once used.

#BehindTheSoapMaking
5511 2018-06-28 14:12:40 #RupeeInICU Here's How it Will Affect You
The weakening rupee will make crude oil, fertilisers, medicines and iron ore, which India imports in large quantities, costlier.
5512 2018-06-28 14:12:32 Ummmm...No....Iran will be off market soon that is what is causing this spike. India and Iran had agreed to trade oil in INR which was positive news for INR bulls but now since Iran will be banned India will have to buy from other countries in USD
5513 2018-06-28 14:12:29 NEW: TRADING Gold Buy 1252- Usual stops.
Positions are Long Markets, Gold & Short Bonds & Bitcoin.
If wrong we won't fight much as too much profit not worry whatever happens.
We plan to add Long Copper/short Oil Hedges

5515 2018-06-28 14:12:10 So funny. Snake oil came up in a conversation with my wife the other night. It might not be available but we’re still talking about it!

5517 2018-06-28 14:12:06 The rupee has fallen to all time low.
The oil prices at all time high.
The crude may not be available from Iran.The cost of money at all time high.The credit flow to farmers at lowest.Private investment at all time low.Economy looking robust as SIP in mutual fund of UPA policies.
5518 2018-06-28 14:11:55 So much for Modi's bearhug foreign tours at a huge cost to the Indian exchequer! USA issues an ultimatum to the so called free world to stop oil trade with Iran! India decides to comply crawlingly! So much for India's superpower ambitions! Modi regime's tall claims get exposed!

5523 2018-06-28 14:11:07 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
5524 2018-06-28 14:10:59 Coconut Oil is one of my favorite ingredients, great for moisturizing!  I love to use it in soaps for it’s great lather and cleansing properties.

Even better to use in your hair for some much needed hydration!

This is kind of a big deal to me because my first set of oil pastels when I was around 6 or 7 where Grumbacher and they are still my favorite  Now I am part of the Grumbacher Family!
5526 2018-06-28 14:10:58 I'm a real Albertans...with a small business..the economic downturn was due to a serious & sustained drop in oil prices. That is a fact not an opinion.This gov has done more to fight for taking oil to tide water and diversify the economy than any previous gov. Do a web search.

5533 2018-06-28 14:10:34 If you wanna purchase such an oil, I can tell you where to get it. If you’re more into making it, I’ve used herbs for my self-love working so I can suggest some.
5534 2018-06-28 14:10:34 I need to go get my oil change before I leave in the AM
5535 2018-06-28 14:10:24 Put olive oil bottle in fridge. Let chill for days. Remove to thaw for imminent use, leave on table amid many surfaces, cracks to drip into; never think to remove old radio under table. Go out on errand.

Return and behold kitchen.  Where did this all come from? What exploded?
5536 2018-06-28 14:10:20 Is this like a Crude Oil Futures situation?
5537 2018-06-28 14:10:14 Ffs I got tanning oil in my eye

5547 2018-06-28 14:09:33 Oh my goodness...straight tea tree oil on big bites is the best decision I’ve made today. Immediately stops the itch, cools the bite, and smells delicious @younglivingeo 
5548 2018-06-28 14:09:32 All the pieces coming into place ....Now if only Jorge would put his suntan oil away and get that world class striker signed #wwfc
5549 2018-06-28 14:09:29 China, Russia & India are now trading oil and gas in Yuan, Rubles & Rupees not the U.S. Dollar. The U.S. Petro-dollar is dead.

You do realize we live on  a bubble hurling through space and these "enemies" in your mind live on the other side of the planet, right?
5550 2018-06-28 14:09:29 Palm oil is also in so many other products. Trying to find a soap without palm oil is very difficult.
5551 2018-06-28 14:09:29 isn’t the @dnc still trying to rig system w/ its super delegate rule?

in CA blue state, we still have dirty fuel, oil/gas lobby, big ag, delta water project guys calling shots in Sacramento.  Even though citizens don’t want it. Follow @DanBacher to keep up to date on that news.

5558 2018-06-28 14:08:46 No SINGLE SMART IRANIAN want to live under zionist and us occupation like in the 1950 when they where sucking iranian oil and making you backward! 

Iran is the only country today in the ouma who can be proud of his achievements! you are a zionist agent!
5559 2018-06-28 14:08:45 Sorry son forgot to tell you our feet dry out as we get older. Eat a tablespoon of Olive oil with your meals. Buy some aquafor cream and eucern creme  Mix them together and apply them nightly. Feel free to ask your parents anytime we have not left Earth.♡♡

It escalated quickly.
5561 2018-06-28 14:08:31 Living w/ a mechanic is the WORST thing ever. They leave grease & oil spots everywhere. Can’t ever have a clean restroom Bc my brother leave his dirty ass finger prints on our white door & sink & gets the rug dirty every DAY.

5563 2018-06-28 14:08:22 Sans faire de vie, je me permets de revenir sur un quasi-amalgame: le français de Belgique est une variété de français et non un dialecte, en revanche, on peut – par ex. – dire que le wallon est un dialecte d’oïl… ou variété, ça joue aussi! Mais la notion de dialecte est ambigüe
5564 2018-06-28 14:08:18 First off, the sanctions are stupid and destructive. But, they are extreme, and will impact in regards to IR's ability to produce oil/gas, just from a financing and goods perspective. I hope IR understands very few support this silly endeavor, and like the rest of us, wait it out
5565 2018-06-28 14:08:08 Twitter in a nutshell:

Thousands of indignant, panicky, outraged tweets regarding stolen babies, loss of human rights, the death of democracy, etc. right there alongside ads for shoes (the New American Loafer) and the oil & coal industries. 

Crazy times.
5566 2018-06-28 14:08:02 With #Crude #Oil at these prices, inevitable that $EMES, $HCLP, $CHK will have mega spikes to catch up..

5570 2018-06-28 14:07:51 Oil companies spend 80% of their time aggregating data and 20% analyzing.

We want to flip that and have them spend 80% of their time analyzing and 20% aggregating. 

It’s time to unlock data silos and create solutions that allows O&G companies to make smart decisions.
5571 2018-06-28 14:07:46 Coconut oil in coffee is a game changer.
5572 2018-06-28 14:07:45 The oil marketers are grunting.

5578 2018-06-28 14:07:06 I also had a leaky olive oil bottle in my corner bottom cabinet. Just as dinner guests texted they were almost there, I stepped in a puddle of oil about 18" wide oozing out of the cabinet. Floor, lazy susan and cabinet floor under wiped as guests drove mere blocks. It was awful.
5579 2018-06-28 14:07:01 But also trash BC they charged me $60 for my oil change and then told me I have an oil pan gasket leak that's another $360. I ain't getting it fixed though

5594 2018-06-28 14:05:55 Inflation is driven by oil prices (it cost more to produce and stock an item). Can rasing interest rates to cool a dead economy do anything?
5595 2018-06-28 14:05:47 I have a headache here.  Annual inspections for safety/emissions.  EVs still need the time-consuming safety checks that is an hour+ of my time.  With a Volt, I can ask for an annual oil change then as well.

5600 2018-06-28 14:05:13 Serious question - how did Israel rig the oil price? I’m not an anti Semite, so some evidence would be nice.
5601 2018-06-28 14:05:05 Well, if you learned about oil production in NS you are much younger than me. Yes we did Shakespeare and Burns and works by English writers. Nothing about Scottish history so I gave it up in 4th year.
5602 2018-06-28 14:05:02  Major hint dropping. Hey, the squeaky wheel gets the oil...and the rest of the Durango! Rooting for ya & congrats on nearly 20 years!!!

5620 2018-06-28 14:02:13 Why does all the oil revenue have 2 b evenly distributed today when it has not been done up to & including today? Remember, please, asking. Why cannot each region distribute its revenues 2 its own? This is demanding #Tripolitania have at least 50% all revenues. Not going to fly

5623 2018-06-28 14:02:01 Why are we voting for & electing deceptive leaders who promote "clean coal" & oil companies in this day & age? We have eaten too much of marketing & advertising in our lifetimes, too much reflex faith in our own domestic Public Relations bullshit & ignoring world-wide science

5633 2018-06-28 14:01:18 It is the availability of oil money that is fuelling the docility of most federating states not to be creative in boosting their IGRs. Very unfortunate.

5659 2018-06-28 13:59:29 Panic selling for some can provide an opportunity to buy. I have consistently used crashes to buy for many years. From oil embargoes to unfortunately 9/11. Let’s not forget Y2K. I don’t like seeing anyone lose money. It’s why I’m here.
5660 2018-06-28 13:59:22 I know, so much corruption on your part! You believe Russians over the country you claim to be president of - you’re nothing but a two bit snake oil salesman who’s time is coming to an end - can’t wait until you go to jail

5662 2018-06-28 13:59:09 Nonsense. We somehow manage to finance trillions for the military, tax cuts for the rich & subsidies for profitable oil co's, but can't have our tax dollars go to things that actually help the American people? You are flat out wrong. we can easily afford Uni Health Care.
5663 2018-06-28 13:59:02 Doesn't rising oil prices strengthen the dollar anymore? (supply of dollars VS the demand needed to buy oil).

5669 2018-06-28 13:58:29 Oil. Gold. Iron. Natural gas. They have resources. Look at South Korea v North Korea.

5672 2018-06-28 13:58:21 The weakening rupee will make crude oil, fertilisers, medicines and iron ore, which India imports in large quantities, costlier. Though these items are not for our daily consumption, they impact our finances indirectly.

5691 2018-06-28 13:56:45 You are right, BOOM!,  and it is breaking my heart. This whole thing is just so easy to see happening - spreading like an oil spill ...right into our sea of citizens.  The problem is: the GOP wants it this way. Why?  Just tell me: why?  Is it ALL and All-WAYS about money?
5692 2018-06-28 13:56:36 I like this cheeky "this time will be different". 
By the way the last 3 years within oil&gas industry have been terrible (lots of redundancies, companies bankruptcies, etc)  and I'm glad we're slowly getting out of it.

5709 2018-06-28 13:54:28 I need to go year by year breakout on GOR as this is direct gas chart.  They’ve been digging tier 2’s up think since late 16 as I’ve looked at this in the past.  They might be calling it infill digging in tier 1 zones in between legacy wells but it’s still tier2 oil and profits.
5710 2018-06-28 13:54:25 $PED feels like to oil what $DRYS was to shipper run back then - a double digit squeeze wouldn't surprise (as said, I've locked in an exit regardless, just what it feels like watching this trade).  Don't take as gospel ;-p
5711 2018-06-28 13:54:23 Bank NPAs around 20 % as per RBI. At some point nxt year base metals and oil will go up a lot and continue to go up a lot  with periodic  corrections for many years. We are commodity consumption country so need to rebalance the economy.This will take time.

5892 2018-06-28 13:37:06 Come on, get your head out of the oil companies crotch. If you don't think there is  gouging on the long weekends (esp in summer) when everyone is filling up their boats, bikes, trucks etc. Then you're just nieve, sorry. Stop justifying it by price per barrel increasing.
5893 2018-06-28 13:37:04 The world needs both gold and oil. Both have value in their own right and different uses.

5914 2018-06-28 13:35:18 Not in 2015. I mean, Canada especially had a huge crash of the oil trade from 2014-2016. I lived there during that time and the tar pits were left empty for majority of it.

I mean, obviously you're anti-Labour, but do you not have a logical reasoning for that?
5915 2018-06-28 13:35:14 Reading in The Guardian today that a football pitch size piece of the Amazon went every SECOND in 2017. Soy, beef, timber and palm oil comes at a savage price. Too late to change.

5927 2018-06-28 13:33:53 I work in the oil and gas industry and the fluctuation in pricing has nothing to do with the President. Interest rates are up and as a result so are people’s 401k’s. I was not a Trump supporter and did not vote for him in the primaries. I am a supporter now. #MAGA

5954 2018-06-28 13:31:45 Coconut oil is high in natural saturated fats.Saturated fats not only increase the healthy cholesterol (known as HDL cholesterol) in your body, but also help convert the LDL “bad” cholesterol into good cholesterols. By increasing the HDL in the body, it helps promote heart health
5955 2018-06-28 13:31:44 Trumps increases in oil production will do more to hurt Russia than anything else
5956 2018-06-28 13:31:44 They should construction oil refinery , which would create jobs for the residents. It's big distaster to transport oil in such manner

5963 2018-06-28 13:31:09 I don’t think Russia is the problem  China has much more money and ppl. Russia is broke. Europe is threatened by them and wants US protection. Also Russia can squeeze oil resources since Europe’s basically given up on energy independence.

5985 2018-06-28 13:28:33 Sanctions kick in on November 4th this year. If their exports suddenly drop by half, then they will need an oil price that’s twice that; but that won’t happen if Saudi will keep increasing exports. Saudi got what it wanted now out of the Trump administration.

The Mueller probe into Manafort was classified.  Many lobbyists were working in the Ukraine/Russia post 9/11 - 2013.  Why?  Russian oil.  However, Clinton Foundation found that building a pipeline in Syria would be more profitable.

6296 2018-06-28 13:00:07 Delusional response. And I'm someone who protest voted in 1980 for an independent John Anderson for president because he wanted to add a. 50 gas tax increase so we could withdraw from the teat of the oil cartels.  Never made that mistake again. 3rd party Always a spoiler for Dems
6297 2018-06-28 13:00:07 What's a jar of spaghetti sauce, I once spilled a bottle of oil on the floor. Now that was agony :(
6298 2018-06-28 12:59:48 The best part is, No One has Ever convinced them to increase oil production, we've always just Delt with higher gas costs in the summer months. #SoMuchWinning

6306 2018-06-28 12:58:45 Skincare tip of the day: If your skin is oily, this does not mean you should wash it more often. You could actually be stripping your skin of its moisture, which can make it produce more oil to make up for it. This could also cause irritation and inflammation of your skin.

6341 2018-06-28 12:56:17 Stop using that acne soap, you don’t have acne. It’s over drying & your skin will produce more oil to supplement. Fragrance is normally a component to “sensitivity” because a skin that tans, isn’t normally sensitive. Fair, where you can see veins and burns. Go with a Cetaphil but

6355 2018-06-28 12:54:54 The oil and gas pipelines will pay off, for the PRC, central Asia, and the world energy markets. The road and rail networks - with their requisite maintenance and reconstruction costs - will not. Port facilities (a new string-of-pearls) will pay off for PRC & host nations.

6402 2018-06-28 12:50:38 @realDonaldTrump Dear sir, We feel that it is not fare enough on the part of USA to say that India should not purchase oil from Iran. It is purely bilateral issue. Kindly don't link up this issue with USA issues.
6403 2018-06-28 12:50:33 Iran is heading toward non-oil economy. Sanctioning Iran oil export would help the hand of Iran supreme leader in his argument for a non-oil budget. The role of oil in Iran economy is reducing and its sanction won't bit Iran as before.
6404 2018-06-28 12:50:27 Just think about who benefits from Unproductive Iran oil fields?
6405 2018-06-28 12:50:26 You should know the fact,OPEC has increased the oil price, naturally the devaluation of money will take place.

6409 2018-06-28 12:50:02 Couple of weeks ago oil droped quite significantly yet gas barely went down,  but when oil goes back to 70 it adds extra 2 to 3 cents on to the already high price.  Greedy sob's at the oil companies.
6410 2018-06-28 12:49:48 Why, if we have record oil production in this country (more than Saudi Arabia) - are our gas prices going up & up?
This is killing us at the pump!  Which, in turn, effects everything. Worst in CA!

6413 2018-06-28 12:49:41 Moisturiser? Well the obvious one is gun oil, but that's actually an astringent, so not the best choice. We used to use gun oil, mixed 50/50 with hydrolic fluid in desert conditions, but that's very, bad for you. Aloe Vera with graphite oil, good for the skin and manly too.
6414 2018-06-28 12:49:28 You are a human oil spill. You are so gross and I hope you know that its only because your rich anyone deals with you. You would most likely be a sex offender registered for life.
6415 2018-06-28 12:49:18 I thought we were debating power sources. When did this become a tax debate? I don't understand why there are tax breaks for these cars. Maybe the idea is that it's a good thing to not buy oil from Iran, or maybe the savings comes in people not getting emphysema? I don't know.
6416 2018-06-28 12:49:13 I'd like to scrub and wash those beautiful #barefeet of yours.  Afterward, give them a nice, olive oil massage.

6423 2018-06-28 12:48:54 Venezuela’s economic collapse is due to lots of reasons; the gov’t putting all of its eggs into the fossil fuel basket was just one of them. Collapse of global oil market, increasing authoritarianism (again: socialism /= authoritarianism), and corruption are just as important.

6427 2018-06-28 12:48:48 So if you’ve got black pride does that mean you have to drink a LOT of oil then? It’s so confusing. 

Just curious as to why black pride, gay pride, Asian pride etc is acceptable, and you can be proud of those things, but being white is not something you can be proud of?
6428 2018-06-28 12:48:46 Why would Iran continue with cooperation on Chabahar port if India stops buying oil?
6429 2018-06-28 12:48:45 You’re right bubba. Most Americans don’t know where it is. Or that Exxon was sealing a deal to drill oil when obama put those sanctions on Russia. I suspect Obama’s true motive was to stop the Exxon deal. Everything he did was to hurt America.

6574 2018-06-28 12:32:09 My mom used to make us fried ramen. Kinda like yakisoba. Used very little water when cooking the noodles so it basically evaporates then add a little oil and let em fry a little. It tastes so good!

6578 2018-06-28 12:31:39 Hi Jessica, We don’t currently have solid shampoo bars and in the past this has been down to market trends and the use of palm oil – which would be required to make a solid shampoo bar. 1/2

6585 2018-06-28 12:31:18 aku gagal paham sama gel to foam nya innisfree.
dia bilang gently massage to melt make up, ekspektasiku kaya cleansing oil tapi jadinya malah lengket kaya sabun cair belum dikasih air gitu, boro2 bisa di massage.
akhirnya lanjut pakein air biar jadi foam. nah ini baru enak banget

6603 2018-06-28 12:29:07 glad to see the signs and banners along 94, urging people to rethink Line 3. It's complicated, and hard, but we have to find better solutions than oil.

6610 2018-06-28 12:28:11 Oh dear. I’m sorry. I’d really use as little shampoo as essential, or ideally none at all. You could try something really simple lie coconut oil, esp at bedtime. Would do no harm. Is it more seborrhoeic dermatitis? George

6620 2018-06-28 12:26:56 Potential is worthless. Knowledge is worthless. Ideas are worthless...

In the same way that crude oil is worthless.

If you don't transform it into something useful then it is, by definition, a waste.

6635 2018-06-28 12:24:45 Peanut butter isn’t nuts. It’s oil and sugar and a paste. Don’t like the texture of nuts in ice cream. I’d still eat it because duh - ice cream. Just prefer it without
6636 2018-06-28 12:24:38 That's reignited a memory!  Many moons ago in the 70s dropped a glass bottle of cooking oil. It ruined the much loved flares I was wearing as well as the floor. Took days to clear glass and oil. The clothes had to be thrown away. To this day I handle all bottles with care!!

6667 2018-06-28 12:18:48 Thank you for you reply. May I ask why the change in labeling? removing the "100% Australian olives" and the process diagram on the side implies that the oil is Australian but the olives are not. The roo should feature on the front again
6668 2018-06-28 12:18:47 U need to appeal to gods.... 2 white goat,  1 big hen,  40 tubers of yam,  1 gallon of palm oil,  1 gallon of vegetable oil,  2 wraps of voil lace,  2 wraps of white linen cloth,  2 wrap of ankara, 2 kegs of palm wine, 1 white cow, 1 black cow and 50k.

6673 2018-06-28 12:18:09 Nope. Rebranding is a great way of blaming everyone else for the mess the US is in. Turn the news off, find reputable local journalists and start helping where you can. Get involved in politics, Google newscorp/fox subsidiaries and candidates with big oil ties, block them.
6674 2018-06-28 12:18:08 Like wanting to lock someone up without due process, on what basis would he "seize the glory"?? 
Reminds me of his saying we should have taken the oil - doesn't matter to him that such things are illegal.
I just don't understand cult members, I really don't.

6680 2018-06-28 12:17:58 To rid ourselves of fossil fuel dependency takes time. You likely tweeted on a device made of petroleum products. While we transition - let’s be smart. Moving oil via rail through mountain passes, alongside rivers, and through communities  - is not smart (in my humble opinion).

6683 2018-06-28 12:17:35 And let me give you an example why - imagine the oil revenues went to a Libyan central bank based in Zurich Switzerland - there would be no militias to pay but there could still be massive corruption from business men as well as the unproductive salaries.

6705 2018-06-28 12:15:19 Most of the fats we consume take a long time to digest, but MCFAs (medium-chain fatty acids) found in coconut oil provide the perfect source of energy. They only have to go through a 3-step process to be turned into fuel while other fats that have to go through a 26-step process!
6706 2018-06-28 12:15:18 Not even close. With the dems we would have higher taxes and high oil prices. Thought about that or are your guys immune to your scrutiny?

6997 2018-06-28 11:40:07 Dear Chris, I enjoyed your article as it was talking about the most important issue today; the limits to growth. However, I'd like to point out that the trend about global population was merely an extrapolation, ignoring the limits to growth. In reality, it would peak with oil.

I also drove him against a wall and dented his wing so was probably happy to die!

7021 2018-06-28 11:36:42 I actually did break a huge bottle of olive oil at a grocery store once.  In my defense, it was in a box display near an end cap and when I went around the corner, there it was!  They're lucky it was only one bottle but it went all I over!

So starving 80 million Iranians to death cutting off oil purchases is a path to peace?

7140 2018-06-28 11:20:45 @ResiRichard I think they do understand - they are just piloting oil tankers and the ? is can they make the turning circle before they hit the rocks.  Super effective change agents and investment needed.
7141 2018-06-28 11:20:42 I'm sorry it appears to be standard behaviour among the current crop of governing politicians as their moral compass severely wavers. That they cannot see bugging the East Timor cabinet room and robbing East Timor of oil revenue was an immoral act is very disappointing.
7142 2018-06-28 11:20:32 Guys Skin So Soft body oil from @Avon_UK is the best repellent against horseflies.We even use it on our horse and so do many other horsey people  and it’s cheap too.Also if you have been unfortunately bitten by the little evil critters use a cooled down chamomile teabag on bite

7148 2018-06-28 11:20:11 Chart the crude oil prices and EM currencies together and you will find that they both are highly correlated. So, let's stop blaming Trump's trade policies for everything...
7149 2018-06-28 11:19:26 In 2015, when oil prices fell, we took money from the stabilisation to support the budget. Otherwise, the cut would have been severe.

7163 2018-06-28 11:17:34 Lol, those are the most obvious factors, but the main reason is crude prices. As crude prices rise, EM(all of them being net importers of crude) countries need more USD to buy crude from oil producing nations which increases supply of their local currency.Simple supply and Demand
7164 2018-06-28 11:17:31 True that! Never forget how anti Muslims lobbies plotted things against Ottoman Empire to end a glorious era of Turkish Muslims empire.They always ready to poke their nose in Muslims countries business. You know the smell of oil and the fear of Muslim countries unity though.

7187 2018-06-28 11:13:19 Of course. But like China they can & will deal with Iran if commercial terms are right. As an aside, in net ($ equivalent) terms Iran could lose a lot of exports & still get more value than a year ago with oil at $45 (& leave oil in the ground). Problem is monetising value #OOTT

7264 2018-06-28 11:02:38 I see #UKOG summer pump in full flow. Despite my current feelings on their valuation, it's nice to see traction in the UK oil and gas sector.

Taken a small position in #ANGS (150k at 4.54p) as this often follows suit. Had a great trade in this one last year, same again please.
7265 2018-06-28 11:02:36 They are testing an existing well and will be able to sell any oil produced offsetting the costs of the test equipment #ukog

7404 2018-06-28 10:42:58 Will USA guarantee oil supplies! Without that, this USA's threat amounts to bullying. It will probably end USA's foreign trade. President Trump must listen to knowledgeable aides & not act impetuosly. He is running a country, not Trump Inc !

2) world trade declines fast, Congress gets really upset.

7566 2018-06-28 10:17:05 Election is only a year away. Economy in bad shape. Trade surplus negative. Rupee depreciates. Oil price bound to go up. Prices of other goods are at the extreme. No employment generation. It could not be an easy riding for the incumbent Govt. at the centre! 

You disagree?!

7569 2018-06-28 10:16:17 What worries me is that there won't be TIME for the effort. Climate change is coming, whether the oil barons like it or not. And the tragic irony is that it will cause enormous refugee problems... exactly what such people say they don't want.

7575 2018-06-28 10:15:20 Even crude oil price in hyperinflation right now is due to rehypothetication, oil tied up in financing, not available for consumption.
7576 2018-06-28 10:15:18 If you are in Russia to mind your business, you will thrive. It is no mean feat to be able to bounce back so quickly from a recession, after oil price crash, and with a much stronger economy even under the weight of sanctions because of the events in Crimea.

7805 2018-06-28 09:35:46 It is indeed true. two to three yrs before there was a decrease in crude price worldwide but the rupee devalued. So the rate of change of crude price is lesser than the rate of change of depreciation. hence oil price risen. And now its double jeopardy with this increase in crude.

7950 2018-06-28 09:12:22 There’s all this mass hysteria because people cannot distinguish between restricted prescription medicines and illegal street drugs.

Solar & wind is very much married to gas/oil/coal in the rest of the world to pick up when there are clouds / no wind. Maybe that's why the world looks a bit different for you.
8002 2018-06-28 09:00:43 oh watching the leaders fail and fail and fail, when will they learn, only renewables will win its price is lower than oil, gas, petrol, coal and its getting cheaper.

8126 2018-06-28 08:40:56 In hindsight the decision not to reduces taxes on petrol is probably a wise decision. Given, the expected volatility in oil and dollar there will be lot more opportunities to use the tax headroom to control fuel prices in future.

8289 2018-06-28 08:09:38 The problem is oil. From an economic standpoint, the govt cant be blamed for the free market intl price. However, it did pat itself on the back in 2014 when oil was at its worst as if it were responsible for the low price, so now it pays as Indians struggle.

8327 2018-06-28 08:02:57 A number of factual errors though. They don’t change the gist of the article but context matters. For ex. the fact that 95% of oil and gas revenue comes from the area was replaced as ‘palm oil.’ Then you have the very cursory treatment of the 2016 events and 2017 internet block.
8328 2018-06-28 08:02:50 Sorry to disappoint your views the petrol price has nothing to do with President. Oil price has increased around the world. The rand plummeted has many factors that affects it. World economy is not strong due to the effects of the financial crisis.

8337 2018-06-28 08:01:01 That does sound good Tom. I hope that proves to be true. I'm open minded about this but naturally sceptical. Oil companies don't have a good track record in these situations. they have a lot to prove and trust to earn.

8598 2018-06-28 07:12:40 It’s not that oil is overpriced - it’s the price of refined fuels in relationship to the price of the unrefined product. Arguably, it’s no less efficient than 40 yrs ago, when crude was $40/bbl & gas was less than a buck a gallon. Futures vs. demand screws the price.

8631 2018-06-28 07:06:06 Yes - the SNPs big mistake was to try to outflank labour on the left. Socialism and independence are oil & water. A fundamental schism at the heart of the SNP. They're really the Alt-dependence party. Not Independence.

8645 2018-06-28 07:03:15 When you are dealing with petroleum you need to know the first rule that is the crude oil needs to be refined or it will destroy the engine of a car or diesel can destroy a truck if the fuel is not correctly measured, airplane fuel totally different from the latter two. So 30% NO
8646 2018-06-28 07:03:10 These poor women are simply marketing gimmicks used to make this barbaric country seem more palatable to westerners. They are trying to diversify their economy with oil prices in the toilet. Somehow they believe we will want to vacation there. HARDLY!

8696 2018-06-28 06:56:20 As I was taught the function of oil is to absorb the heat on the burn and applying ice on the burn would cause abrupt contractions on the tissues.
8697 2018-06-28 06:56:13 When ? Lol if I knew that I’d be a multi-millionaire. I think oil can be a useful indicator. If it gets to $150 again in the next year I’d be expecting repercussions in equites, that’s all I have . Good luck with your trading .

8748 2018-06-28 06:47:30 gods have spoken, taking over oil fields as incentives for the Khartoum peace agreement is a confirmation that Bashir has been funding the war. He traded his support for either side and opted for neutrality. whatever the compromise, we are still great enemies.  #Peacewithin

8754 2018-06-28 06:46:16 I don't think we can underestimate the power of teachers ticked off at @EPAScottPruitt 's pillaging state resources to give tax breaks to his big oil buddies at the expense of their students.

9020 2018-06-28 06:00:31 These doors at the hospital yooo, they need some oil. Que barulho vem a ser esse?
9021 2018-06-28 06:00:29 @realDonaldTrump : you no need 2 dictate India from where to source crude oil ..
9022 2018-06-28 06:00:25 I changed the oil in my car today for the first time ever which I think is manly enough to earn 7 episodes of Gilmore Girls and a nice bottle of Chardonnay.
9023 2018-06-28 06:00:25 U.S. oil prices dipped away from three-and-a-half year highs amid high output from Russia, the United States and Saudi Arabia, although unplanned supply disruptions elsewhere and record demand stemmed a bigger decline.

9032 2018-06-28 05:58:40 Methinks Terry might be a weeeee jealous.
9033 2018-06-28 05:58:38 I'm loving this Maybelline Fit Me poreless foundation and face powder. BUT the oil control is not really great compared to L'oreal Infallible pro-matte.
9034 2018-06-28 05:58:35 So I took 3 melatonin gummies, drank sleepy time tea, bought a diffuser and it’s on with essential oil in it and I’m still awake. Wtf else is gonna help me sleep.
9035 2018-06-28 05:58:29 That’s OK, Trump will just replace him too.
9036 2018-06-28 05:58:26 Hell nah Popeyes and KFC change their oil once a week
9037 2018-06-28 05:58:14 Tell that to the employees of the English and golf academies. Another example where labour thinks it’s the smartest guy in the room and decides to write off valid businesses it thinks shouldn’t exist. Did it with oil, doing it with coal. Hopefully they’ll target tattoo parlours
9038 2018-06-28 05:57:55 who knew coconut oil would have been the answer to all of my problems
9039 2018-06-28 05:57:36 割といつでもなんでも旨いけど、夏ならウニ、ジャガイモ、アスパラガス、花咲ガニ辺りは絶対うまい

I don’t feel ashamed or anything because I know what I want and I want them all to listen to me and help to change something. Because of you I thought about Palm oil&the danger for animals there. Thank you Nat!

9046 2018-06-28 05:55:34 When I know that he plans on staying out until 2+a.m., I just take long ass baths now. Like, bathe, drain, refill, add sea salt, relax, drain, refill, add coconut oil, etc.  <<< and that's about exactly my face. It keeps me from stewing.
9047 2018-06-28 05:55:22 Though crude oil price goes high in India people want petrol to be cheap or even free and still want the development.
9048 2018-06-28 05:55:09 Okay. Experience speaks here. The son broke two, I repeat two, bottles of super expensive oil back to back, and had the most amazing smile seeing the dark, growing shadow on the floor. Drizzle wheat  or multi purpose flour. Absorbs oil like a dream.
9049 2018-06-28 05:54:50 Stupidity indeed ... what can one do with crude oil.. tho in their defence its not as volatile as its filterates
9050 2018-06-28 05:54:43 My car went in for an oil change and came out with 7 other problems

9058 2018-06-28 05:52:53 Accounting of oil is fucking annoying!!
9059 2018-06-28 05:52:50 That olive oil voice puts me over the bars.
9060 2018-06-28 05:52:48 Seems you are far away from reality.. Are you saying that govt did not hike taxes when crude oil fell.. Are you saying that govt reduced taxes when crude oil prices increased... Are you saying that prices of vegetable and pulse never spiked in 2015??
9061 2018-06-28 05:52:41 Neither have I, and having accidentally downloaded an Andean traditional cookbook I'm no wiser. It just says "oil".
9062 2018-06-28 05:52:19 I lived in Venezuela for two years,  so true!! beautiful country they had it all agriculture, oil, tourism, now it’s all gone....

9064 2018-06-28 05:51:46 Actually, SNB didn’t explain it explicitly. They just pointed out that the forecast for 2018 is slightly higher due to a “marked rise in oil price”. But the forecast for 2019 is lower due to “muted outlook in EA”.
9065 2018-06-28 05:51:44 parang umeepekto yung caster oil ah hahahh

9070 2018-06-28 05:49:47 Huh? What’s your evidence to support that conclusion. 

America buys most our goods and the majority of our oil, we should be maybe a little humble.

9074 2018-06-28 05:49:18 What about European countries paying for oil in Euros directly from their central banks?

9086 2018-06-28 05:46:31 Boiled eggs dipped in spicy masala gravy! Here's how you can make the yummy Egg Masala Curry.
1. Take boiled eggs in a bowl. Add ginger-garlic paste,red chilli powder, turmeric powder, salt & cumin. Mix them well.
2. Take a pan of oil, put the eggs in it & saute.
9087 2018-06-28 05:46:21 It's a long way from that QW feature on Goanna Oil. Or is it? Trent Dalton takes on the world. Look out world!
9088 2018-06-28 05:46:15 Rupee falling low or high is only an economic indicator based on several factors. It may effect oil imports and some material imports that may cause inflation. The bright side is that exports become attractive. People overseas can remit more at lesser flow of funds.
9089 2018-06-28 05:45:48 Imagine if the Muslim world executed a "Oil Ban to the US"  which of course is less inhumane and demonising that the US Muslim Ban, imagine just imagine the US reaction?

9104 2018-06-28 05:43:58 The Trump regime has confused the whole world, as Japan, the EU, China and others asked for a ban on the full import of Iranian crude oil. He is confusing the world. It is the state before the World War II

9180 2018-06-28 05:32:02 To be fair, rupee crashed I'm 2013 because of our mismanagement. The headline says it's falling because of trade war fears and oil price shock.
9181 2018-06-28 05:31:57 Burning the midnight oil. A lot of reading and thinking. Frames of mind need to be channeled.

9190 2018-06-28 05:30:32 I have no clue why I decided to cook tonight in a strapless dress as I stood over a frying pan filled with hot oil. I have multiple visible burns all over my chest and face as a result...
9191 2018-06-28 05:30:26 I am at the point of tired where I DEADASS USED MY HAIR OIL TO OIL MY FUCKEN BODY!!!! shit. lol.
9192 2018-06-28 05:30:24 My eyes were open before he was elected. I saw him selling snake oil a mile away. He had me at over using the term "common sense" he was trying to manipulate people into thinking they were wrong if they didn't agree with him. If you didn't you had "no commen sense"...
9193 2018-06-28 05:30:09 Man, I had boo help oil my scalp & wash my hair the other night & let’s just say I was better off doing it myself ....thanks for the help thou baby.
9194 2018-06-28 05:30:03 Rupee touches life time  low of rs 69 vs $. Crude oil surges to 77$ per barrel.  India staring at severe economic crisis but modiablind bhakts are in deep blind bhakti.Had it been congress led UPA these bhakts would have lynched them on social media.

9196 2018-06-28 05:29:44 I know we really can't get along with the Left because oil and water don't mix. Obama is the snake in the room who is quietly coiled to strike...Be alert.
9197 2018-06-28 05:29:26 Nice!! I’m so happy for you! Are you using any meds to help or just natural stuff like cbd oil, weed, etc?
9198 2018-06-28 05:29:21 Massage coconut oil on your scalp. Your hair might not be growing because the skin in your head isn't nourished enough. Also, Pantene's Beautiful Lengths shampoo and conditioner made my hair grow like crazy!
9199 2018-06-28 05:28:58 Sadly no. Reminds me of Margaret Cho. To paraphrase - What are you gonna do with that? Check my oil?

9220 2018-06-28 05:26:02 キルカメ無いし
9221 2018-06-28 05:25:46 But in Islamic Regime. You sell oil instead of barrowing from bank. (Actaully you spend from past instead of loan from future) you distribute it among a network of loyal people who guarantee your access to oil reservoirs..and you dont need production! (Sorry for bad english.)

9224 2018-06-28 05:24:45 #indiaUS relationship has severe terbulance.  Trump's transactional approach will dilute gains on weapon transfers and closer military cooperation.

9225 2018-06-28 05:24:39 @jimcramer @MelissaLeeCNBC Russia supplies China with alot of nat.gas & oil, since we have no allies in this trade war, what if Trump suggests lifting all sanctions against Russia if they help us by cutting the oil to China. China has to buckle then, they need oil...

9229 2018-06-28 05:23:51 I always get amused by that. Wrestling is SUCH a (traditional expectation of a) lady friendly sport: flashy costumes, super buff men and women looking all kinds of fabulous, baby oil, dramatic storylines, Bobby Roode dressing like Bianca Del Rio...
9230 2018-06-28 05:23:37 Ive seen a wierd TV show about some dude who was addicted to popcorn oil. All day every day he would make popcorn, throw it away, and lick tho oil from the packet cause apperantly it got him high. And u know what? At least he was enjoying himself where as this is just autism.

These kooks would spout “winning” while breathing the fallout and sifting through the debris of a nuclear bomb gifted by the tiny Asian doughboy Un.
9234 2018-06-28 05:23:11 @realDonaldTrump can we work on re-establishing the U.S. based oil production. I understand America has vast, untapped resources. AND promote corn-based ethanol or hemp- based fuels to augment?
9235 2018-06-28 05:22:59 People seem not to realize that the future of the world is electricity, and that the major proof of work supporting the economy today is oil which is far more an ecological & social  disaster than mining will ever be.

9251 2018-06-28 05:19:20 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
9252 2018-06-28 05:19:06 Not a good move. We should be looking at owning that oil and refining it.
9253 2018-06-28 05:19:01 So I read that putting castor oil on your eyelashes can help make them grow. So naturally I dipped a mascara wand in some castor oil and put it on my eyelashes. WELL MY DUMB ASS DIDNT THINK ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF OIL THAT WOULD BE ON THE WAND AND NOW I HAVE OIL IN MY EYES
9254 2018-06-28 05:18:35 I find using eucalyptus essential oil in a diffuser helps. (I just use the cheap Walmart brand) also warm liquids such as a tea(or hot water) lemon juice and honey mixture. "summer colds" are the worse...Get better soon!

9258 2018-06-28 05:17:51 Could you also concoct anointing oil as per Exodus 30:23 (sweet calamus translates as qaneh-bosm in Hebrew i.e. cannabis) and James 5:14 (oil for healing)? Maybe also the perfume of Exodus 30:35 and church-censer incense of Ex. 40:27 (both also likely made with some cannabis).

9281 2018-06-28 05:14:28 keilah has one in her name. our check tire light was on but it always came on when the weather got really cold so ignored it. went for an oil change and apparently had a nail in our tire. $250 i didn’t have out of pocket but had the card!
9282 2018-06-28 05:14:25 Exactly. Same for Venezuela oil and India purchasing S-400 from Russia. 
India can't give in to such dhamki.

A nuclear Pakistan is way more dangerous than Iran. US is interested in preserving the petrodollar. India can't suck up to that. Similarly, can't allow shady US NGO's.

9314 2018-06-28 05:10:03 For YEARS I have been investing in oil free skin care items/ products for oily skin overall. MONEY ON TOP OF MONEY  double cleansing, deep cleaninsing, and extreme exfoliating twice a week. To find out today... that I've officially... fucked up my skin to the max 
9315 2018-06-28 05:09:24 I think a 5-7% correction in large caps will bring the indices in line with broader markets, spread more panic thus making the case for a bottom. Future events: Politics, Oil & INR. All in all a roller coaster :)
9316 2018-06-28 05:09:15 Holy sh.. I think I'm starting to spot a trend there. The inflation rate must be off the charts. They have no domestic oil for starters. Tons of gold ownership but it's all in private hands and they never sell it.

9368 2018-06-28 05:00:13 That report is BS, for 1 thing there is no 10% unemployment in Baytown.  They are building 2 new steel plants right now in that area, ask @GregAbbott_TX. This guy sure wasn't complaining 5 yrs ago when he was selling at a premium to the oil fields in So. TX, ebb and flow, ECO 101
9369 2018-06-28 05:00:10 The oil is said to pull toxins out of your body. The benefits I’ve experienced are as said my teeth getting whiter and shitting easier. I think it’s worth a try for at least 1 week because I’ve never seen something so natural whiten my teeth in so little time.
9370 2018-06-28 04:59:58 @Skippy Natural has finally figured it out. After years of labels that said no stirring required, but with huge pools of oil on top, their low salt, low sugar variety actually comes well blended.

9374 2018-06-28 04:59:23 Looking at the ingredients, Scarlet oil, the antiseptic, isn't as antiseptic as betadine, and definitely doesn't help emulsify like betadine.

I think it's worth considering for a test batch.

Note: I used to work in pharma and compounding was in my lane
9375 2018-06-28 04:59:10 Coconut oil is really only useful to me in Canada like 4 months out of the year, after that my fro is frozen from how cold it is outside... What are your fav oils for your hair?

Oil and minerals not the only thing you exploit. Shame
9378 2018-06-28 04:58:52 I recommend honey, coconut oil, and diluted apple cider vinegar. There’s also chemical stuff you can use but I wouldn’t advise it unless the scars are serious
9379 2018-06-28 04:58:16 Ana, check to see how heavily Marco is invested in Russian oil. While you’re at it, see how much his campaign has taken from Russian oligarchs. They’re not spineless - they’re GREEDY

9497 2018-06-28 04:38:03 No, she has been adamant on that point.  The Left wanted her to step down so Obama could appoint her replacement, bit she blew them off.  Apparently, Morticia plans to stick around for as long as she can.
9498 2018-06-28 04:38:00 It’s so many times, but the recent one I’m going to use. That EO that “Freed” the kids, he also put a nice clause in there, making it okay for oil companies to dump in our oceans again. This is a threat all because he wants to grow his bank account.

9506 2018-06-28 04:37:02 Why the word "unprecedented"? As if Rupee has not depreciated before under any government or what? In any case given that we import so much of our oil, rising crude oil prices are going to impact the currency. Do remember, rupee fall does help our exporters.
9507 2018-06-28 04:37:00 That's weird.
9508 2018-06-28 04:36:48 AMAZING FACT: The earwax inside your ears is actually made up of a combination of oil, sweat and dead skin cells. Earwax forms a barrier inside your ear canal and it helps to keep your ears clean.

9550 2018-06-28 04:29:16 I’m sure the folks in the Middle East appreciate the national security concerns of the USA over a guaranteed oil supply.  Just don’t question what the long range consequences of that post 911 are.  And will be.  Folks have slightly long memories.
9551 2018-06-28 04:29:04 Pick up a book sometime read about Standard Oil and see what competition means when there are no regulations in place to prevent the stifling of said competition.

9565 2018-06-28 04:26:43 Here's a fair idea.Draw a 50/50 territorial line through Palestine ignoring where the gas or oil is,find alternative energy sources,it's available.Then tell the zionist entities they're damn lucky to get that 
9566 2018-06-28 04:26:38 You need to go back to the 1953 coup in Iran by the British and USAto install the US puppet Shah. Iran was democratic until that coup, but was selling oil to Russia. The Shah's dictatorship created the Islamic revolution in 1979.

9574 2018-06-28 04:25:35 Does coconut oil count as a spice? If so, I can imagine sweaty gym socks taste like it.
9575 2018-06-28 04:25:23 Alberta has been a “have” province for decades. Sending billions upon billions to have not provinces over those decades. THEN get told by those same provinces that our oil is dirty and shun us.
Tell me I’m wrong.
9576 2018-06-28 04:25:20 Yeah why not ruin another beautiful wilderness place in this country. Instead, we could make solar panels or wind turbines, which the oil and gas companies could retool and make billions in the future. Stop thinking in quarterly profits. Invest in the future
9577 2018-06-28 04:25:16 Working from direct experience? Crying a little because that was the first time I brought myself to spend money on olive oil in months, then spending over an hour trying to get the floor completely clear of both oil and tiny dagger-shards of glass.
9578 2018-06-28 04:25:12 I think it's safe to say that, if my 84-oz tub of coconut oil is liquid, my apartment is too warm, yes?
9579 2018-06-28 04:24:45 Well. I Start my new job in the oil field tomorrow morning. 
Thanking the lord every step of the way for giving me this opportunity. #BlessedBeyondBelief #chasingthatmoney
9580 2018-06-28 04:24:32 I really like my Saje diffuser, I recommend getting one of theirs if you can. It's also fun choosing which essential oil/oils for it, I have a couple that I alternate. The store has great customer service too. I think I've seen those Scentsy warmers but no, I've never tried them.
9581 2018-06-28 04:24:29 I'm just saying I have a type and it keeps hitting me in the face like a pipe casually collected from a group of oil barrels and currently flung at me

9584 2018-06-28 04:24:21 Haha. Most Canadians have figured out what a charlatan you are along with your band of gypsy thieves selling their snake oil. Go away already.
9585 2018-06-28 04:24:18 @realDonaldTrump Hey if India stops buying oil from Iran as you say, will you arrange oil for India at lower prices and acceptance of INR as payment currency instead of USD? You're a businessman right? If you want something so badly, then give something to make India happy too

9617 2018-06-28 04:19:27 Now they're putting in oil pipelines  Ironically it's supposed to run right through a town that has had an active mine fire since the 70s, so if you hear a booming sound in the distance, you know what happened lmfao

To be honest, I don’t thing white liberals care that much.  They’re too worried about their 401k (fueled by prisons & oil) to change and vote for justice.

It’s apathy of the privileged, to the point of surrender.

9644 2018-06-28 04:15:18 @FilamentFrenzy @Proto_pasta so despite the profiles there are occasions where I stil get jams with the glitter filament. So I tried using a little oil, and viola it went off without a hitch after two failed prints in a row. It works, but I feel like I shouldn’t be using it
9645 2018-06-28 04:15:15 it was literally half a handful of coconut oil and a spoonful of sugar. mix it in your hand, and you’ve got it. make sure to moisturize after though. works WONDERS

9693 2018-06-28 04:07:38 Aged balsamic vinegar from Italy ($200) and really good Italian olive oil ($100 per bottle). Totally worth it. The balsamic is to die for

1 leek
1 fennel
1-2 carrots
Cut all into small cubes.

9786 2018-06-28 03:52:54 Kind of have to disagree US oil imports is Canadians sourced (besides anyone which land a troops there and oust Manduro would have to be ready to fight a jungle guerrilla warfare against 500.000 chavista with AK).
Not seeing how US have any interest to do something about Vene.

9917 2018-06-28 03:34:59 I'm in oil and gas. And the market is moving so wildly in crude lately. I personally prefer to avoid trades where commodity pricing has that big of an affect. Beautiful setups can turn ugly on a dime.
