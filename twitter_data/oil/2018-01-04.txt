40 2018-01-04 23:58:07 Interestingly, you are NOT a WA resident. You appear to live in Israel. Have you seen the Pacific Coast in WA, OR & CA??? Have you physically walked the beaches? I’ve lived here all my 64 years & am unalterably opposed to drilling here for oil. AK has suffered damage from spills.
41 2018-01-04 23:58:03 Sorry, but this is paranoid nonsense. Oil fields are all over Texas, everywhere. No sig. pollution issues. I work in environmental geology. Oil drilling is well regulated to minimize any pollution risk. & what happened to environment after the horrible Gulf oil spill??? Nothing!

43 2018-01-04 23:57:48 Then why is OUR air continuously dirty in the winter and why do we have oil trucks hauling black waxy crude every minute from the Uintah Basin to Woods Cross, adding not just the pollution from the trucks but added pollution from the refining process?
44 2018-01-04 23:57:44 OIL prices should be at 250 a barrel... maybe then we would use bike more and cut that bad colesterolo!
45 2018-01-04 23:57:31 Agree on that. U needed oil indexation to determine a gas price when there were no markets in the old days. In europe there are mature markets meanwhile. So i do not see much rationale for oil indexation anymore.
46 2018-01-04 23:57:30 Andy what a shit but I guess to get s plumber out quicker won’t be easy unless costly . Can you use an electric heater in meantime? I use a great mini v powerful oil heater. Take care xxx

48 2018-01-04 23:57:07 Listen to Shah’s interview with David Frost. He said five oil companies wanted him out cause Shah raised the oil prices.
49 2018-01-04 23:57:06 Why make it sound if energy is found in U.S. it will cost the consumer less. If Exxon finds oil here they are not going to sell it to us cheaper. If the going price is $100 a barrel they will charge us $100. Be honest. We are not dumb the WH is.

51 2018-01-04 23:56:57 Go carefully, roads are shit and i regularly see oil
52 2018-01-04 23:56:56 Gee, with the oil industry in the cabinet, who would have seen this coming? 
53 2018-01-04 23:56:49 Nooo. Follow the Jason Statham rule. You don’t need (head) hair when you’ve got big arms.

55 2018-01-04 23:56:27 The price of gas is on the rise. You know some greedy oilmen have put money in Trumps pocket to do unnecessary drilling. Dick Chaney might have his name on some of the oil. It’s all about the dollar  not anything about the people.
56 2018-01-04 23:56:25 Not saying weed is worse than opioids, but maybe we should explore treatment options that don’t always involve some kind of substance. CBD oil is one thing if it’s truly needed, but why legalizing regular marijuana for recreational use? We have enough issues in the US as it is.

62 2018-01-04 23:55:48 We are getting through days just fine with current  production. This isn't a choice between not drilling in protected areas and not consuming oil at all.

69 2018-01-04 23:54:59 Not the Afghan people in general. Terror organisations. The oil and gas is worth an estimated $123 billion. $2.4 trillion is estimated to have been spent on the war in Afghanistan. Either the U.S are terrible at maths or your wrong.
70 2018-01-04 23:54:58 Your right, but nothing's fair in life
71 2018-01-04 23:54:54 Nah nah, a pan full of oil, chuck in the fish. How hard can it be
72 2018-01-04 23:54:52 Does anyone use Bio Oil? Does it work?
73 2018-01-04 23:54:52 EeewwwwHahahahaha
74 2018-01-04 23:54:47 I'm surprised they didn't use Deepwater Horizon.
75 2018-01-04 23:54:47 THERE IS NO REASON FOR OUR NATION TO IMPORT ONE DROP OF OIL OR GAS...WE SHOULD PRODUCE EVERYTHING WE NEED AND HAVE LEFT OVERS TO EXPORT
76 2018-01-04 23:54:41 I’m following you, let’s help to regain your the results of hard work...
77 2018-01-04 23:54:40 I told you, ban combustion engine like China build a bus and train system like China, we can phase out the present cars and trucks or better yet stop building and start recycling older gas models to electric to.
Even if we are left with are still left with some oil it will slow.

84 2018-01-04 23:54:00 Hey, genius, technology will kill the oil industry, not more oil. But, then, you know that. You’re only trying to spin up tomorrow he ignorant.
85 2018-01-04 23:54:00 So true!
86 2018-01-04 23:53:58 Most failures are transportation accidents.  Drilling rigs are typically good for marine life.   Off the coast of CA oil naturally leaks continuously.  Same in the Gulf.  Yes DH was a bad accident. So was the one where the lake disappeared into the salt mine.
87 2018-01-04 23:53:52 I have thick eyebrows lol what am I doing to them but brushing them with coconut oil drawing them would be useless
88 2018-01-04 23:53:40 Absolutely, we aren't used to having to really use our heat either. Up north they use oil and gas heat because it gets cold enough
89 2018-01-04 23:53:29 @WoodmansFood35 just wanna thank Jesse he is a manager. And Dan in the oil change department. Woodmans messed up and lost my oil cap. But they got me a new one and helped me out so much. Thank you
90 2018-01-04 23:53:28 Heard that oil exploration regulations around North America were lifted. Couldn’t handle the news.
91 2018-01-04 23:53:27 Yes “grow up” before you become a fan of a different team. If not just continue cheering for the Oil lol
92 2018-01-04 23:53:21 i wish we had says me oil :/

97 2018-01-04 23:52:57 Hospital. You didn't get Mersa getting an oil change.
98 2018-01-04 23:52:55 Does that include the savings in money and lives some of these regulations save? Or is it more about making payments to special interests Like allowing drilling for oil of the US coastline! #TrumpCrimeFamily #HypocriteIvanka

101 2018-01-04 23:52:48 I just paid last week to have an alignment done and my oil changed . But if i don’t do anything else..... ima make sure my car good &healthy !!
102 2018-01-04 23:52:48 They are desperate to help oil companies... however fail to understand that oil is cheap because there is oversupply... more production will depress oil prices more, good for consumers but oil companies will struggle more... Exxon pays dividends by issuing debt!
103 2018-01-04 23:52:39 Boost his vitamin d and try cutting out his food to see if he’s allergic to something xx olive oil also helps x
104 2018-01-04 23:52:38 Heard you the othet day talkin bout coconut oil... 
Please tell me more.
105 2018-01-04 23:52:33 You saying all that because you want there oil start a war and create fake news again to make people think they’re bad guys
106 2018-01-04 23:52:31 Not for money. Not for oil!
107 2018-01-04 23:52:27 You could just get some Cinnamon oil and put it In some rubbing alcohol and water.
108 2018-01-04 23:52:20 OMG  Let us contribute to another gigantic oil spill in the Gulf, or off the coast of FL and CA.
109 2018-01-04 23:52:14 Omg I need it now. I love olive oil and all things Italian
110 2018-01-04 23:52:10 I literally couldnt have less respect for anyone more than you.  Wisconsin unemployment continues to grow and you are bragging about oil drilling.  Total weasel!  Eeeew
111 2018-01-04 23:52:09 and yes an oil spill will create jobs in the cleanup industry.
112 2018-01-04 23:52:03 Aint NO bipartisan oppo, FAKE REPneeds 2 B as energy independent as possible. Oil is the fuel of our economy and is 2nd 2 NONECorp lootingThat's how it was w/ 35% tax rate - govt stealin from successful entrepreneurs#DemsDontknowBitnez
113 2018-01-04 23:52:03 That’s the idea, we will export oil now, get out of debt quick
114 2018-01-04 23:51:59 I was really fenna fuck my shit up I was about to put anti freeze where my oil at 
115 2018-01-04 23:51:53 Generally speaking I’d say no. These guys aren’t chasing 45API OIL with a small geological barrier with a 20API package below it. A difference of 1-2 API is immaterial
116 2018-01-04 23:51:45 What weenies.  I do remember when they pumped your gas checked your oil and washed your windshield.  Geez I’m a dinasaur

120 2018-01-04 23:51:10 Between Oil Drilling being opened in all our Waters and the reversal of Legal Marijuana, to Trump appointing crooked District Attorneys in SDNY, To Nuclear Button Wars, I hope DEMS are reminded DAILY as to why we MUST win the 2018 Elections. Our Lives depend upon it.
121 2018-01-04 23:51:07 Marco you voted this guy in. Now you will have oil on your hands and on the Florida beaches.
122 2018-01-04 23:51:00 My ceraphil is at my moms and house and my slippers and tea tree oil is at Shayla’s House so I guess my skin just bout to be going through it 
123 2018-01-04 23:50:57 Try ingesting #curcumin with olive oil to increase bioavailability
124 2018-01-04 23:50:54 Try hypoallergenic food that is wheat free and yumega oil anti itch on food,u can get the oil on Amazon,I have a 7yr old sharpeii who have known skin problems
125 2018-01-04 23:50:46 Sure, I get that. But engaging in one of the most destructive mining practices ever for the sole purpose of continued oil supremacy is still harebrained. Especially if he knows he's taking down the Cabal & will be distributing free energy at some point.
126 2018-01-04 23:50:45 High heat Sunflower oil is the way to go
127 2018-01-04 23:50:44 Lmao I sent extra so she could just have it. But normally it’s like 100+ cuz she has a sports car and it takes synthetic oil.

129 2018-01-04 23:50:31 Of those 76 countries, I'm betting way less than half are Muslim majority. And of the Muslim majority countries, oil is of greater interest than religion. Some are about Islam, of course. 9/11 led to the invasion of Afghanistan. Iraq was/is bullshit and lies, but your claim 2/
130 2018-01-04 23:50:31 Just turn the off-shore oil drilling over to British Petroleum.. what could possibly go wrong? Deep  Water Horizon, you say? What’s that? 2010 you say?...
131 2018-01-04 23:50:30 Olive oil is the cooking equivalent to duct tape, as far as I’m concerned.
132 2018-01-04 23:50:30 Probably not an accident. They’ll make this about Russia, too
133 2018-01-04 23:50:23 Is it not clear what Trump & his administration are doing?

Removing rights from people & giving them to corporations:

- Remove ease of voting
- Remove marijuana legalization
- Remove net neutrality

- Give corporate tax breaks
- Give access to drill oil
- Give away US land
134 2018-01-04 23:50:10 Take a look out your office and see how many vehicles are going by. Then ask yourself if anyone cares....big oil would personally like to thank you for using their product on your journey home today. Cheers!!! #ItsBeenZeroDaysSinceJennyUsedOil
135 2018-01-04 23:50:07 And Oil Can Boyd, which reminds me of the best headline I wrote for The Gazette:

137 2018-01-04 23:50:05 For the walls of the Eye, all the oil, we have all the more unbearable because none could give room for escape, it had killed her.
138 2018-01-04 23:49:54 It's so disheartening to have a government that only cares about money and trying to invest in oil when the rest of the world is investing in clean energy. We can't open up 90% of our waters for drilling and not expect another disaster like in 2010. We must protect our oceans!!
139 2018-01-04 23:49:51 Lmfao my car takes synthetic oil it’s $100
140 2018-01-04 23:49:50 I know plenty of single guys that work there ads off in the oil field who make that or more.

Only #Environmental Damage, #Destruction & Anhilation...

147 2018-01-04 23:49:21 Girl! Get some lavender oil! I swear by it! Next time you feel one coming on, rub some lavender oil on it multiple times through out the day. It might take a couple of days, but it'll go away. It might even help right now with the swelling. Essential oils are life!
148 2018-01-04 23:49:18 castor oil!!!!
149 2018-01-04 23:49:17 Imagine if all of the states in the US could achieve this. Imagine if any of the states in Australia were anywhere near this level. SO disappointed that money from coal and oil buys so much influence, to the detriment of all of us.
150 2018-01-04 23:49:13 I think the way I like them is like lightly coated in oil and then kinda just cooked a little in a pan. I like bell peppers the same way, to keep them cronchy.
151 2018-01-04 23:49:08 Doesn’t take much imagination to envision each beautiful piece of America drenched in oil spill as deep water horizon. This is what our interior Department is working on. Once we create superfund sites in our national treasures they will be gone forever

155 2018-01-04 23:48:56 $250 for an oil change? Theyre robbing you
156 2018-01-04 23:48:51 Lmao oh I replace that and my oil but just not when they recommend to
157 2018-01-04 23:48:44 i put coconut oil on timbochees legs bc it was dry n now he hates me :-(
158 2018-01-04 23:48:43 3,, lost 1,613 followers and all my pictures,,, for one word,,, and I have seen so much worse,, than what I said... writing it all down,,, taking names... really upset me... not fair at all...
159 2018-01-04 23:48:37 Usually NYS inspections cost more than $6.95 so in my experience any place charging so little for them survives off of finding any little thing they can charge you for.  Most car dealers or mechanics go through your car during oil changes and let you know if they find anything.
160 2018-01-04 23:48:32 My car is fixed. $470.00 later. 
Its burning oil for some reason and I need to keep up on how full it is. There were plastic covers underneath my car that were loose. They said my suspention was good. My tires need to be replaced soon.

162 2018-01-04 23:48:31 Trump: "oh yeah, I DO know Steve Bannon. Me and his father were in the olive oil business! But that was a long time ago!" #Bannon #FireAndFury #Trump #POTUS #SteveBannon
163 2018-01-04 23:48:29 The Trump Administration is opening areas to oil exploration and drilling. That’s a good thing.
164 2018-01-04 23:48:24 This isn’t exactly happening on a daily basis! @realDonaldTrump is right; let’s go get the oil!
165 2018-01-04 23:48:12 If he likes  Oil rigs and drilling so much shouldn’t one go right in front of Mar-a-Lago? IJS
166 2018-01-04 23:48:04 What could possibly go wrong? He’s such an expert on #climatechange it can only mean he’s an expert on offshore oil drilling too. Gawd, but that man is ruining our beautiful world almost single-handedly. One day his progeny will curse him to the winds. 
167 2018-01-04 23:48:03 Sorry. We are all too busy here in #Maine, focusing all our efforts on retail recreational marijuana. 
No time to care about healthcare or heating oil. #mepolitics
168 2018-01-04 23:47:56 The notion of "States Rights" is a political catch-phrase used to incite hatred.  If we don't do something soon, we'll soon be cleaning up oil spills from our beaches...just like Texas.
169 2018-01-04 23:47:50 he's obviously smoking the best oil
170 2018-01-04 23:47:41 Do you mean you don't have a kitchen, or you haven't learned? If the latter, quick tips:

1. Pan on medium heat, a bit of vegetable oil or butter (~2 tbsp) in the pan. When a flick of tap water makes the oil sizzle, fry any sandwich in it, checking doneness with a spatula.
171 2018-01-04 23:47:38 Tells mom I'm having cramps today, 5mins later I have oil in my hands. #essentialoils #solveseverything
172 2018-01-04 23:47:37 A throwback to the good oil' days
173 2018-01-04 23:47:36 Agreed but changing a multi trillion dollars economy takes a long time. In the near term we still have to use oil as we make a transition.
174 2018-01-04 23:47:28 Same sort of happened in Venezuela... this time resources (Venezuelans' oil being donated to socialist countries like Ecuador, Argentina, Bolivia and Nicaragua to gain supporters of that regime)... that's like exporting resources to support "uncontrolled immigration"
175 2018-01-04 23:47:13 You didn’t get it from under your bed did you?
176 2018-01-04 23:47:10 My hypothesis based on Jason Fung’s book is that lots of oil and fiber with the pasta makes it better.
177 2018-01-04 23:47:07 Oh it's Oil Man!
178 2018-01-04 23:47:05 Oh ur talking about oil.  I was talking about sanctions.
179 2018-01-04 23:47:03 Roasted veggie and ground pork curry <3 Eggplant, sweet potato, brussels sprouts roasted with a lil garam masala and olive oil. Added to onions, chiles, red bell pepper, tomatoes and 1/4lb ground pork. Garam masala, yellow curry, turmeric, and coconut milk. With rice.
180 2018-01-04 23:47:00 It is...
181 2018-01-04 23:46:47 If I had discretionary wealth I would start drilling for oil in the waterway by Mara Lago. Seems fitting. Fair. Great. #realDonaldTrump
182 2018-01-04 23:46:38 i have a hash oil cartridge that actually tastes like blackberries and it's so good

185 2018-01-04 23:46:11 Have you tried giving him CBD oil or even blowing pot smoke in his face? I know multiple people who do this with their dogs and seems to greatly reduce seizure activity or stop them entirely.
186 2018-01-04 23:46:10 Fire Jeff Sessions. He's lost his mind. Medical Marijuana and the Cannabis Oil are good for the American people to treat the illnesses that ail them. Don't believe the Big Pharm lies. @realDonaldTrump #LearnTrueLiberty
187 2018-01-04 23:46:07 That's my point though. Basing an economy around oil is retarded. Destroys environment. If the environment dies, we all die. IF Trump is taking down the cabal, it would revolutionize world economies. But there's no signs of even preparing for that change. Just more of the same.
188 2018-01-04 23:46:07 When did Republicans stop being state right party oh that's right when it didn't fit their politics.  He's a dick if he goes after this. Before my mom died last summer medical marijuana was the only relief she had to chronic pain from MS. She used the oil didn't smoke it.
189 2018-01-04 23:46:02 essence gue pake setelah exfo toner + hydrating toner, sebelum serum & facial oil. manfaatnya kayaaknya biar serum & skincare step selanjutnya mudah menyerap
190 2018-01-04 23:45:57 Coconut oil or castor oil?
191 2018-01-04 23:45:46 Will he steal their oil too?
192 2018-01-04 23:45:32 Oil.  Remember what prez douche said during a pre-election interview?  He would have taken their oil as payment to rebuilding them.  Doesn’t matter the US bombed the fuck out of them in the first place.
193 2018-01-04 23:45:31 Is it not remarkable? Simple oil of cloves, and how amazing the results
194 2018-01-04 23:45:28 Your girl just exfoliated w a coffee scrub , used @westernandrose shower cream and now I’m moisturizering with their dry oil. My skin is happy.

196 2018-01-04 23:45:26 Well you can use normal flour instead :) 
And soymilk, oil (instead of almond butter)
197 2018-01-04 23:45:21 Do you even know what you’re saying? The very people the higher minimum wage is trying to help are the same ones who will lose their job entirely. But that’s ok because some oil workers lose their job when oil prices drop...just wow.
198 2018-01-04 23:45:18 Wallah getting an oil change brought my car back to life
199 2018-01-04 23:44:59 don’t trust anyone. except the banks and the oil companies. get it together.

205 2018-01-04 23:44:38 My best sandwich is only for mushroom fans - marinade a portobello in oil/vinegar, grill and top with provolone, serve on a toasted kaiser roll with pesto and some grilled  green peppers, onions, and fresh tomatoes. bet you could add bacon!

209 2018-01-04 23:44:02 The best! I like frying them in Greek olive oil and sprinkling salt, pepper and Greek oregano  all over.
210 2018-01-04 23:44:01 Always have to try new stuff. I also do photography, poetry, art & video editing +drove across country w/ a buddhist monk. I get bored easily, lol. My wife is exhausted from my all my interests. at all these recipes is making me think I can’t do SOS. I need my salt/oil.
211 2018-01-04 23:43:50 So..... I put Olbas oil in my bath just like I always do with a cold... only this time it decides to burn my back leaving me with some sweet ass pink blisters. Ah yes, well done me
212 2018-01-04 23:43:42 My oil change was $25, yes lord come through 
213 2018-01-04 23:43:41 That old oil money coming in clutch

215 2018-01-04 23:43:33 No coal.           No oil.          No fracking.       Who is going to pay my electricity bill. subsidizing energy has not made my bill cheaper.  I don’t want to depend on other countries for energy.
216 2018-01-04 23:43:32 He's not just doing what Obama did. He's doing more of it. Oh, and he's just opened up all US coastal waters to oil drilling. ALL of them. What a guy.

220 2018-01-04 23:43:04 Oh Mags! So sorry! you need to sleep if you can have a hot bath then a fresh shower, put somelavender or roses oil near your pillow, close your eyes and be concentrated on your breath , it usually works! xxxx
221 2018-01-04 23:42:53 Our economy is still oil based. The less we have to rely on World Supply the better off we are.
222 2018-01-04 23:42:39 I didn’t know I needed eyebrow oil until I got my most recent @PetitVour box, but now I know I do.
223 2018-01-04 23:42:38 Y u never highlighted the this drama and exposed the drug which being traded by both the isis nd the soldiers in afganistan? All the drug and oil rich countries u will find america nd isis there. What a coincidence isnt it?
224 2018-01-04 23:42:35 Wind farms not oil
225 2018-01-04 23:42:27 We have been changing to alternative fuels and renewable energy for years renewable energy for years the oil companies and republicans are trying to make so they all get richer. They could careless about what we say we want or what other countries are doing. It just about...
226 2018-01-04 23:42:25 I prefer My coastline to NOT be cluttered with Oil rigs...He is the President of Fossil Fuels, when we need a President that pushes for Clean Energy. He is just killing the earth faster...

231 2018-01-04 23:42:08 We need cheaper oil prices!!!  Drill baby!!!,drill!!!!
232 2018-01-04 23:42:00 Can we start drilling in #Wisconsin next? #Paulryan might feel differently if his kids, his property values, and his state’s economy were affected by oil spills. #nooffshoredrilling #protectourcoast
233 2018-01-04 23:41:59 Britain couldn't feed itself in 1940 every available piece of land was pressed into service. There were less than 50 million ppl then.  Research what's happening to mountain gorillas due to our need for palm oil. Migration routes and farms. @PopnMatters
234 2018-01-04 23:41:49 china steps in where we leave - it's about 15B/yr in trade w china - so that much less US currency is required as Yuan replaces it.. Iran sells oil to China in Yuan..one of the reasons we don't like them - USD heading lower-good for exports/bad imports
235 2018-01-04 23:41:49 I get the brown rice with quinoa and red peppers. Mix it with some olive oil? Mmm *shimmies*
236 2018-01-04 23:41:49 Sessions is, in many ways, more scary than Trump. Trump is just an actor, a snake oil salesman, a pretty face, and self-funded his own campaign.

241 2018-01-04 23:41:23 I have olive oil. 
242 2018-01-04 23:41:19 Ya , like Keith wants any of his boys getting wrecked by the Oil organization.  Where careers go to die .

246 2018-01-04 23:40:59 You know if this kind of crap happened in a middle eastern country that had oil, America would use it as an excuse to invade.

America was never much of a democracy but any pretence is now abandoned.

249 2018-01-04 23:40:46 This isn’t Trump. Sessions has always been against even Oil that would help seizures or helps pain. He should have remained a senator
250 2018-01-04 23:40:43 when I had an older car it didn't have it, but most newer cars do. I think you're thinking about the oil pressure light, its not that. I have a lil digital screen on the dash that shows my mileage & the temp outside, it says change oil & makes a sound when its time to change it.

255 2018-01-04 23:40:38 Hey Jason! Great question. None of our oils contain nuts of any kind. They do contain sweet almond oil, but almond is not actually a nut. It’s a seed. So shop freely!
256 2018-01-04 23:40:28 ベスーベスー！はははやめろってくすぐったい～
257 2018-01-04 23:40:25 What size is it? You can just do a bit of olive oil and salt, or ruin it with a bunch of rosemary like many people seem to favour. 
258 2018-01-04 23:40:21 It's good as an introduction and concise history, but it's maybe geared more for youth. I'd want to read some more in-depth histories next. It's full of really beautiful artwork, though (oil paintings of players, teams, stadiums).
259 2018-01-04 23:40:15 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
260 2018-01-04 23:40:02 Has anyone seen a statement from Rep Frelinghuysen about the gas/oil leases?
261 2018-01-04 23:39:59 I know right? And Trump wants to offshore drill for oil in California. Hope they don't hit any techtonic plates out there.
262 2018-01-04 23:39:56 Since a future administration can rescind this #offshoredrilling silliness instantly, it's a stupid investment. Oil rigs at sea take 2-3y from finding to producing, and need to produce for years to make back capital costs. Peak oil is 3-5 years out. Can you say #strandedassets?
263 2018-01-04 23:39:52 You typed your message on a plastic keyboard. Plastic comes from petroleum. No oil means not hearing from you ever again.

I'm beginning to like solar and wind power...
264 2018-01-04 23:39:51 So I got a bulbasaur from build a bear workshop, added a couple of drops of lavender essential oil, and now I have an anxiety buddy. I love Bulby.

270 2018-01-04 23:39:33 namjoon is cooking spam with water instead of oil…. 
271 2018-01-04 23:39:32 Agreed, but long term and near mid term enviro damage was zero.  Oil is a naturally occurring material and other organisms eat it.

274 2018-01-04 23:39:14 That's the lichen club for men (and boulders).
275 2018-01-04 23:39:09 Gavin, the purpose of the 1999 Order you mention was to establish where the Scottish and English authorities would regulate fisheries - it had nothing to do with oil.
276 2018-01-04 23:38:57 All of us living on the CA coast  will be out in force to #StopOffshoreDrilling! We've had too many accidents that spoiled our beautiful coastline. We don't want oil companies off of our shores! Stay Out! Go down to FL adjacent to Mar-a-Lago and spill as much oil as you want!!
277 2018-01-04 23:38:52 I strongly oppose the Trump Administration’s new proposal to open nearly all U.S. federal waters and coastlines to oil and gas drilling.  This is yet another reckless decision by a President driven to exploit our valuable national resources for short-term gain by a few companies.
278 2018-01-04 23:38:47 Hydro, solar & wind power are the future.
Big corporations who made a killing in the 60s, 70s, & 80s using coal, oil & soil are not up to date so they are using their power to hold the U.S. back from progressing. Or they can't handle change. They are in company w/ Trump.
279 2018-01-04 23:38:40 Cleaned your Windows, checked your oil and water and put air in your tires. All for 33-70cents a gallon

282 2018-01-04 23:38:19 it is a fraction of what big oil sheds at each downturn...
283 2018-01-04 23:38:17 It's 635 and today I went to the super market. Did a mayonnaise, egg & castor oil mask in my hair, washed it, put in flexi rods & made dinner. I also had breakfast & lunch. 

I did all of that and still have time to relax. Im wasting my life away going to work.
284 2018-01-04 23:38:06 once all our water ways have been filled with oil we will finally be the best country ever!!

287 2018-01-04 23:38:00 China will have renewables powering its country while US has “clean” coal & oil. @potus & GP r real visionaries.

289 2018-01-04 23:37:55 If there is a general strike by the oil workers, it will be the beginning of some profound changes.  Even if Khamenei donned a hardhat with a wrench, the government would be powerless to get the oil flowing again.
290 2018-01-04 23:37:53 I think more power to Lily's elbow, and our man from Barnsley should know to put wood in oil, that Emily would rather a woman have a seat at the table than pay heed to a gobshite wi knobs on. Patriatrchy is what's made models and actresses, so ironic a fella should grumble on it.
291 2018-01-04 23:37:51 Ew I have to go get my oil changed and tires rotated. Car errands are my least favorite 
292 2018-01-04 23:37:50 So Trump wants to allow oil drilling in Florida waters. How about right off Mar a lago??
293 2018-01-04 23:37:49 @BigSpikey My car requires a specific type of oil  for some odd reason and it takes an extra quart of oil 
294 2018-01-04 23:37:46 That makes sense if you haul some of the regions out of the CMHC trading area stats for sure. Considering the market had to deal with low oil, fallout from last years budget, that moronic stress test the feds keep pumping and 15%HST (for new home construction), that's excellent.
295 2018-01-04 23:37:46 I’m old enough to remember stepping on tar balls and swimming through oil slicks in Grand Isle Louisiana before there was offshore drilling in the gulf. If you don’t drill for it it just sleeps out of the sea floor anyway
296 2018-01-04 23:37:43 Yes, that's all I care about myself...the oil for possible future pain mgmt and any healing effects like you said.
297 2018-01-04 23:37:39 @SecretaryZinke bad-bad idea-you need to do your job as Sec. of the Interior and take care of the land. We don't need the oil. Oil is low at $50 a barrel. We don't need any accidental spills-this is bad-
298 2018-01-04 23:37:37 Ni probably gonna be smart af, she was up with me burning the midnight oil
299 2018-01-04 23:37:31 that might've been the dumbest thing i've ever done aside from throwing water on a oil fire in my stove

302 2018-01-04 23:37:05 Trump unveiled a controversial proposal to permit drilling in most U.S. continental-shelf waters, including protected areas of the Arctic and Atlantic, where oil & gas exploration is opposed by governors from NJ to Florida, a dozen attorneys general, and over 100 U.S. lawmakers.

308 2018-01-04 23:36:28 .@POTUS- Ask the 200  Members of Congress, including many Republicans, who oppose expanded oil and gas drilling... #ProtectOurCoast 5/6
309 2018-01-04 23:36:26 Then pass an oil extraction tax like every other fucking oil producing state. Even Texas has an oil extraction tax. Taxes limit drilling and at least fund schools when there is drilling. Do more than talk tuff
310 2018-01-04 23:36:25 Are you prone to breakouts? Coconut oil is very comedogenic. There are other beard oils you can find that doesn't contain that. Find a blend with castor oil.
311 2018-01-04 23:36:23 You can forget seafood ad Trump I'd allowing off shore oil drilling everywhere.
312 2018-01-04 23:36:20 im getting my oil changed n my phone started playing new slaves by kanye at the part where he says “theres leaders n theres followers” but then it cut off meaning it connected to bluetooth in my car so the poor man got “BUT ID RATHER BE A DICK THAN A SWALLOWER” blasted at him omg
313 2018-01-04 23:36:19 One of my favorites is pasta with garlic, olive oil, and parmesan. That's it. Super simple and great on a cold night.

315 2018-01-04 23:36:18 @thehill @RepAdamSchiff Ryan, your off shore drilling also means more oil spills & damage to our ecosystems! Please retire now, don’t spend another year bringing our country down any further than you already have!
316 2018-01-04 23:36:11 There is marinol, cannabis oil and other options that give you the same effect, the only difference is you don’t get high. People want “medical marijuana” to get high. Media always forgets to mention that.

319 2018-01-04 23:36:05 I have Never seen any President disrespected more than #POTUS45.  It's really a shame.
320 2018-01-04 23:35:39 We don't need the extra oil-the extra jobs are great, but they can be trained to do things, like research. Oil prices are low. We don't need the possibility of another oil spill. This is just not needed.
321 2018-01-04 23:35:36 Are you in a competition to prove you’re stupid or does it just come natural after oil companies line your pockets?
322 2018-01-04 23:35:31 I just got an oil change, tire rotation, and alignment for free. Every time I go for services he always hooks it up because he says I remind a lot of his daughter and my smile brightens his day

324 2018-01-04 23:35:25 Stop invading countries for oil and power and there will be no need for war, now get off Twitter and be the president of that corporation you call a country!
325 2018-01-04 23:35:21 You know you’re cold when you can’t melt coconut oil in your hand 
326 2018-01-04 23:35:20 This people think they are gonna have to pump the gas from the ground as a crude oil or some shit lol literally most states already do it.
327 2018-01-04 23:35:15 No it isn’t the 1970’s but at the moment we are still reliant on oil. Please show me the solar powered or hydro powered car that doesn’t require oil that is currently mass produced.

331 2018-01-04 23:35:02 Sounds like a GREAT plan to me. Better than buying oil from middle east tyrants!
332 2018-01-04 23:35:01 Snare, kettle or oil drum?
333 2018-01-04 23:35:00 @realDonaldTrump isn't forcing companies to build more platforms. If green energy really is booming then decreased oil demand will solve the problem.
334 2018-01-04 23:34:53 i've got a but and it needs its oil changed if you catch my drift.
335 2018-01-04 23:34:44 folk looking to minimize environmental impact need to act before oil is reached. but-CA is also rich in environmentally aware programmers, so cyberattacks are also possible.

345 2018-01-04 23:33:43 I usually chuck a 2-2.5kg one in for about 2/2.5hrs. Rub olive oil over it, sprinkle dried rosemary, a bit of garlic on it. Or not

We'll try & remember them as nukes fall.

361 2018-01-04 23:32:32 @boblatta are you ok with drilling for oil off shore? How will this help Americans? How will it benefit Ohioans? Would you be ok with drilling in the Great Lakes? When are you going to stand up to trump

367 2018-01-04 23:32:13 You guys should move to New York! Cuomo loves jet’s & yacht’s & Multi Million Dollar luxury homes but hates it when poor farmers and landowners try to use their oil & gas rights to pay their taxes.

The inner cities were devastated this way.
So were countless small towns.
It's not impossible.
We are in this situation globally w banks, oil, computers...
Every essential is % controlled by a few people who have enough  to live for 1000s of years.
What can we do?
373 2018-01-04 23:31:45 OUCH! To be honest, I really hate pumping gas especially in the rain and COLD weather. Year's ago we had someone pump the gas, check the oil level and clean the windshield. It was kinda nice.
374 2018-01-04 23:31:36 It’s not a joke anymore ! Industry seems getting back after pro oil & gas policy by trump administration
375 2018-01-04 23:31:30 Allah grant you shifaa kaamilah 'aajilah mustamirrah

377 2018-01-04 23:31:27 Can hardly wait to look out the window and see hundreds of oil wells sprouting up in the ocean.
378 2018-01-04 23:31:26 To drill for oil, esp w/o much in the way of regulations. If it's all about the money, who cares about the oceans, right? Ok, I'm done.

381 2018-01-04 23:31:09 @senrobportman are you ok with drilling for oil off shore? Are you prepared for the consequences? Would you be ok with drilling for oil in the Great Lakes? When are you going to fight for Ohioans & Americans
382 2018-01-04 23:31:07 We do not need oil for domestic use.  Are we going to ruin ocean life and pollute the water to sell to other countries?  Americans will not benefit from the drilling.
383 2018-01-04 23:31:00 I would applaud it if it meant  Americans destroying their own land to quench their oil thirst instead of invading countries/financing puppet regimes abroad; alas this won't prevent it, but will further envrmental pblems and start race to bottom for poor oil exporting countries

388 2018-01-04 23:30:28 Every year the world consumes more oil. Focus on reducing consumption. One or more cars per person is a problem. Walkable cities with trains is the solution.
389 2018-01-04 23:30:27 So true. Also the cost of materials should enter into the equation. Food or oil paints? Let's see....

392 2018-01-04 23:30:14 As part of this plan will companies be responsible for the entire amount of damage an oil spill would cost? Put the money ahead of time in an escrow account. Make sure to account for lost wages of fishermen, etc not just the actual costs of an environmental spill.
393 2018-01-04 23:30:13 Who really thinks the oil industry need just about every regulation needed for safety of workers & environment?
394 2018-01-04 23:30:13 “WHERE IS MY GODDAMN CBD OIL?!?”

395 2018-01-04 23:30:06 The illegality of cannabis eliminated hemp.Our oceans and landfills would not be as polluted with plastic today if they had invested in hemp instead of oil. Hemp is an environmentally friendly renewable resource that would have helped our environment, if they hadn't spun madness.
396 2018-01-04 23:30:02 When will you pay tax on the oil that flows through it? Ever?
397 2018-01-04 23:29:52 Hey this is great. Free oil with every fish and beach walk!
398 2018-01-04 23:29:50 @redlobster if you guys would stop using soybean and canola oil in your food, that would be great.
399 2018-01-04 23:29:48 Yes that was a terrible disaster. I lived in NOLA at the time and the fishing industry was really hit hard. But how many would be dying of exposure right now if it weren't for oil & gas? We pay some sort of price for all of our modern comforts.
400 2018-01-04 23:29:30 I"m writing a scifi thriller based on the oil pipelines in ND. This will come  in handy for a scene idea. Thanks for posting this!

402 2018-01-04 23:29:16 That's where we take ours for oil changes.
403 2018-01-04 23:29:12 So we’re drilling for our own oil. Why’s that a “recipe for disaster”? What’s so terrible about being energy-independent?
404 2018-01-04 23:29:12 I use petroleum products too, but I just worry that there will be colossal oil spill disasters if everyone and his brother is allowed 3/?

423 2018-01-04 23:27:26 They need the support of whole country to dig out more oil. Only few would end up in hell.

Off the top of my head.
426 2018-01-04 23:27:14 How can we stop this. Neither of my senators (Cornyn and Cruz) will listen to my concerns. Everyone in the country but oil and gas people are against this. We have been totally taken over corporations. Zinke is a worse interior sec than James watts and he was terrible.
427 2018-01-04 23:26:52 In short, more profitable to frack on land than drill at sea. If oil gets back to $100+, then off shore makes sense
428 2018-01-04 23:26:45 Now i just gotta learn how to change my oil
429 2018-01-04 23:26:44 คือ ทำไมเวลาเดินเซฮุนชอบดึงกางเกงอ่ะ คือมันรัดอ่ะๆๆๆๆ

431 2018-01-04 23:26:41 I hope this avocado oil hydrates my hair
432 2018-01-04 23:26:39 Sir I am always open to learn if you would please correct my assertion. All I know is in Trade one sells the other one buys and the buyer gives the seller money the seller then shares the money as needed. in this case Nigeria's oil money so what did I get wrong sir? Thank you
433 2018-01-04 23:26:35 How much money from how many oil mongers did Trump receive to dismiss all environmental concerns? He loves his money so much. More than US.
434 2018-01-04 23:26:33 Yeah..gotta wonder which of the billionaire oil company gurus will come out against it in 5yrs..you know AFTER they make their trillions destroying Earth
435 2018-01-04 23:26:30 At a minimum get if off Schedule 1 to allow testing and  permit use of oil derivatives that have no THC.

438 2018-01-04 23:26:28 He hates us, Representative Schiff, all of us but Nunes.  We cannot let him destroy the beauty and ecological balance of our stunning coastline.  Last thing the world needs is more oil; why not invest in wind farms?
439 2018-01-04 23:26:28 Try to be 93 years old on $15k income and need 80F to handle life and live in Canada. Good fucking luck with no oil and gas! Elites like u!
440 2018-01-04 23:26:24 .@POTUS - Ask 150 coastal cities & towns that have passed resolutions opposing offshore oil and gas activities... #ProtectOurCoast 3/6
441 2018-01-04 23:26:14 Oil over 61.00 today
442 2018-01-04 23:26:13 Though I don't agree with medical marijuana, it is allowed in my state. If I was ever prescribed it I would take pill or oil form. Sorry smoking it smells really bad. But that is my take on it. Sessions is an absolute ass hat how he goes after it though.
443 2018-01-04 23:26:11 Offshore oil seems okay for California, Texas, and Louisiana. Yeah, there were problems, but they've been fixed and it's better than shipping our money to the middle east. So why not here, too? Fusion would be better, much better, but we're not there yet.
444 2018-01-04 23:26:10 hi !! idk where ur from/what products you can get but bio-oil helps a lot of people n should retail from €10. i personally found that beauty kitchen seahorse plankton oil (€22) evened my skin tone, made me glow n reduced scarring if ur willing to splurge on a decent product
445 2018-01-04 23:26:09 @realDonaldTrump Trump is caving to the oil and other industries-Trump is not bravely fighting for the USA and the future generations. #TheResistance #TheResistanceVOTES #ResignNow
446 2018-01-04 23:26:00 Shit happens. Worst environmental disaster in history was WW2. Where the damage? Oil spill damage another faux outrage.
447 2018-01-04 23:25:56 Penne pasta w/ sundried tomatoes, spring onions, radishes, halved Kalamata olives and a ripe avocado sliced; Greek extra-V olive oil and good balsamic vinegar – the wine? Blaufränkisch, of course!
448 2018-01-04 23:25:54 I don't understand the drill baby drill philosophy of this administration. I get that it's about $$ but oil is not super expensive rn. 1/?
449 2018-01-04 23:25:53 I hope your horse bucks you off into the ocean after an oil spill.
450 2018-01-04 23:25:49 I can't stand the smell of coconut oil on my hair I literally feel disgusted but it does wonders 
451 2018-01-04 23:25:32 & that means that it’s working bc my scalp be itching like I JUST didn’t oil it lol & yes I agree it’s def worth it!
452 2018-01-04 23:25:31 Yes but Trump’s pockets are getting fat from big oil.
I bet Exxon Mobil had a few (million) reasons to sway trump into making this happen. I wonder if he knows any former Oil CEOs?
453 2018-01-04 23:25:31 i put in about a tbsp of olive oil before I put the egg in.

thanks for the heads up about the maintenance though!
454 2018-01-04 23:25:30 About to try this new beard oil my sister bought me.

461 2018-01-04 23:24:59 Hmmm.....And what do these 4 countries have in common, OIL?
462 2018-01-04 23:24:50 I’m opening up the White House grounds for oil drilling. Enjoy!
463 2018-01-04 23:24:47 One thought on off shore drilling: it is very, very expensive. To frack a barrel of oil costs $25 per bbl, at $60 per bbl, good profit.
464 2018-01-04 23:24:44 Don’t forget we win because of  ‘oil money’!!  Oil money or water money.. idk! We’re on top!!
465 2018-01-04 23:24:42 It was super really. I’m 31 weeks on Sunday. But let me tell you, coconut oil works magic! I scrub with it in the shower and when I get out I moisturize, put healing lotion, and then massage my stomach for like 20 with coconut oil again. They gotten way lighter.

467 2018-01-04 23:24:41 We have a new CBD healing oil about to launch, great for tattoos! You should try to reduce heal time and quality. Gladly come drop some off.
468 2018-01-04 23:24:39 @PlantTherapy Recently got into essential oils and have been building up a collection of your oils. Noticing the labels come in a few colors, wondering if there's any designation behind color choice per oil? Ex- are green ones all similar but different from brown ones?
469 2018-01-04 23:24:24 Well for starters, why would a judge in a red state like Alabama deny Moore's claim? Jones won, get over it snowflake.
470 2018-01-04 23:24:15 Use castor oil
471 2018-01-04 23:24:05 No. What we need to do is double efforts to reduce travel and consumption to cut need for oil. It’s about individual choice and education.

474 2018-01-04 23:23:53 Isn’t there an oil glut right now?
475 2018-01-04 23:23:50 I’m torn. Can’t decide if this one or the oil drilling directive was my favorite asinine move of the day. So much to choose from!
476 2018-01-04 23:23:48 US Fish will be polluted with oil & cause cancer while wiping out all our ocean life including our shellfish populations. All food off the coasts will be now be consumable but totally carcinogenic.
477 2018-01-04 23:23:46 This is more about optics. There's already far more area available for oil & gas exploration than is being used and the price of oil won't support greatly expanded exploration either. The danger is that it opens up particularly sensitive locations without adequate safeguards.
478 2018-01-04 23:23:32 Coconut oil for amazing for this.

482 2018-01-04 23:23:07 wait for the first oil spill...lets see how you spin it then!
483 2018-01-04 23:22:55 What is the cost to taxpayers when oil spills?  $62Billion for BP?  How many thousands of barrels did you spill on Sioux sacred land?  You are shameless whores...can't wait for @IronStache to kick your ass out of office #2018isComing
484 2018-01-04 23:22:52 ah ok, never mind my reply that i just asked....is it loosening or is it just the finish on it has faded? dont know if you enjoy doing some elbow grease n hands dirty(latex gloves) but if you washed it up, let dry, and do a mix of Linseed oil/spirits rub,which is quite simple...
485 2018-01-04 23:22:26 Oil slicks for everyone!

490 2018-01-04 23:21:52 This is actually great news. We don’t need to held hostage to foreign oil with our vast resources here. This will be great for our economy. More jobs is always a plus.
491 2018-01-04 23:21:49 @katyhearnFit @HaydnSchneider use Murphy’s oil on the floor!! Warm water, scrub it a little and it should work! Stuff is awesome
492 2018-01-04 23:21:48 API/Viscosity of the oil should not change on primary recovery throughout the life of the well. Any change would be near negligible
493 2018-01-04 23:21:47 Coulda got a car wash with my oil change but this damn weather 
494 2018-01-04 23:21:34 It also means our beaches will be full of boil how are fish how are swans are ducks and every bit of wildlife that’s along the ocean shores are going to be full of oil did you not ever heard of Exxon Valdez or better yet BP

504 2018-01-04 23:20:57 WHAT the hell @MSNBC @MeetThePress @chucktodd giving Trump sycophant Sam Nunberg of Roger Stone fame a platform?

505 2018-01-04 23:20:57 Oil and gas is dead, you nitwit.  What is it going to take for the US to catch up with the rest of the world?  Oh, that's right, getting rid of republicans who still live in the past, e.g., Little Donnie's administration.

507 2018-01-04 23:20:18 Let's hope big oil companies make big investments in off shore drilling, then they all get nationalized and dismantled, leaving equity owners with nothing

513 2018-01-04 23:19:32 The pay gap between people who work and those that don't is huge also. About as meaningful as this lie.
514 2018-01-04 23:19:11 we should both know better by now ;) Is it too late to get a job in the civil service or on an oil rig?
515 2018-01-04 23:18:59 OIL OIL OIL . と紙に書くとサザエさんに聞こえる。
516 2018-01-04 23:18:36 I work in the oil & gas industry, and literally nothing he says in that tweet is true.
517 2018-01-04 23:18:35 Under the wing of the huge American power, oil majors pursue their profits. Above all, their philosophy is fundamentally different from ours.
518 2018-01-04 23:18:27 Totally ! And CBD oil !

520 2018-01-04 23:18:27 @MichaelBerrySho Oil price over $60, bonuses look healthy in spring and stock spiked enough 4 me to purchase new F-150 for son and year old BMW for me. Things headed in great direction and like POTUS or not, my purchases affect many other workers and families
521 2018-01-04 23:18:25 ALSO These off shore drilling platforms have replaced over 85% of the American Oil Workers and brought in Foreign Workers.
522 2018-01-04 23:18:23 I was in an all-night diner downing cup after cup of coffee that tasted like engine oil when a new message from BB got me back on the track.

I tried stuffing mine with coconut and tea tree and it mildly helped.... it seems to be a thing that goes away by itself
526 2018-01-04 23:17:54 You mean like th3 entire gulf coast is in economic despair due to the oil and gas industry.  Do you EVER THINK?
527 2018-01-04 23:17:52 Actually it already capitulated in oil seems, with record longs. More interesting situation in energy equities :)

530 2018-01-04 23:17:35 It’s so effective and needs to be legalized ! Sad about this decision . I’ve been using CBD oil which has helped a lot and is at least legal here
531 2018-01-04 23:17:34 Garlic sautéed in oil is best smell.
532 2018-01-04 23:17:25 The Trump Administration's decision to expand offshore drilling is truly outrageous and thoughtless. California's coast is one of our most magnificent treasures and has been protected from new oil wells for over three decades. We will fight this unconscionable decision.
533 2018-01-04 23:17:21 Drill baby drill. The hell with our natural resources or those funny looking windmills and, ugh, solar panels. We need more oil. Who cares that our children and grandchildren won’t see polar bears, seals, birds, and other dying species. They can read books or gaze at oil rigs
534 2018-01-04 23:17:18 Let me get this straight America has Nuclear Weapons, so does North Korea, Iran and Israel. Yet, America and Israel have a problem with the other two countries having it. Let's not forget the fake war we waged on Iraq for oil...oops weapons of mass destruc
535 2018-01-04 23:17:02 About the salt: table salt used to crumble... however if your intestines are dried out, the salt is so hard it'll cut you internally. This is where the pain is coming from; you will have to use fresh-harvested self heal WITH the olive oil. Not just olive oil like before-for that.
536 2018-01-04 23:16:59 A mechanic will charge you $30 to replace a car key battery that costs $6. $70 for an oil/filter change that costs $30 and $1000 for work that you could’ve YouTubed and done yourself. At least that’s what it was like before cars were completely inaccessible lol

546 2018-01-04 23:15:36 It was oil supply/the oil price that caused layoffs.  NDP had nothing to with the layoffs.  Not much policy from Kenney and how he intends to grow jobs.  Slashing the carbon tax won’t happen if he gets in-and he will blame the federal government for that.

555 2018-01-04 23:15:00 @realDonaldTrump you allow additional drilling off the coast of Florida, your Mar-a-lago trips are not going to be so pleasant anymore. Wind turbines fine. Oil, OH HELL NO!

562 2018-01-04 23:14:21 How does letting them come here help anyone there?
563 2018-01-04 23:14:18 That's a good move. We should by all rights be exporting oil not importing.
564 2018-01-04 23:14:18 @eddiecowan what's your secret? Oil of Olay?
565 2018-01-04 23:14:14 it's been a few years since oil have won the lotto. They're due
566 2018-01-04 23:14:09 If you have a water bottle try mixing one of your oils with it that so when you spray the water some oil will already be in your hair strands. Then do your cream and and a little bit more oil to help seal in the moisture.
567 2018-01-04 23:14:03 And make sure it flamencos with the bread in the oil.

571 2018-01-04 23:13:25 So I come to the dealer to get an oil change and it’s the awkwardest thing ever because I’m like I know my car needs something. I’m just not sure what it is Lmaoo.
572 2018-01-04 23:13:22 It also means more pollution of our environment and oil spills too-moron
573 2018-01-04 23:13:12 Public comment period, seriously? There is a full-fledged attack on our democracy and MoC have done nothing to prevent further attacks; see 2016 presidential election, #NetNeutrality forged/fake comments, and #fiduciary rule forged/fake comments. 
Offshore oil & gas ... disaster.
574 2018-01-04 23:13:10 The Oil Ocean boss was hands down the hardest part of the game. Love Sonic Mania!
575 2018-01-04 23:13:01 But it seems to be your argument vs Canadian Oil....  as you so CHAMPIONED Middle Eastern Oil in your previous tweets....I 100% guarantee you that you use more oil products than you think in your everyday routine.  Even if you think you don't.   Don't take it for granted!
576 2018-01-04 23:12:59 Tonight each count will be less than normal. I really want to get to an oil show. I’m feeling frisky.  & classes start on Monday so let’s get real tipsy too!
577 2018-01-04 23:12:55 I never doubted that tight markets imply higher prices as in 12-14 where oil was expensive too btw.and i agree with u, unlike thierry, that ns1 did not cause higher gas prices. Gas2gas comp makes it more and more difficult to exploit market power since flexible sources...
578 2018-01-04 23:12:42 Try half a teaspoon of coconut oil in their tea. Worked wonders for my pooch 
579 2018-01-04 23:12:32 Hey, @realDonaldTrump, the oceans and coasts aren't yours to sell off to your rich oil pals asshole! Try being the President for once and do what's right for America, not what's most profitable
580 2018-01-04 23:12:25 I'm sure the Marsh Arabs and Kurds were displeased when our government was arming their friend Saddam, our bulwark against the evil Iran. I recall the left wing scum in the UK were protesting our Governments' support for the dictator over many years. Until he threatened our oil.
581 2018-01-04 23:12:24 I love going to my local Co-Op. Nothing like feeling like an outsider when your surrounded by people parking hybrids across two spots in a rush to pick up more patchouli oil to mask their weed BO, yet I'm the one given dirty looks when I walk in with my non-hemp clothing.
582 2018-01-04 23:12:22 Heck; I was on the M20 a couple of weeks ago. Never knew you were close by ... It may be some time before I am passing through again, but if I have some freshly harvested olive oil I will definitely drop by. 
583 2018-01-04 23:11:58 Do you know how the big Deep Water Horizon BP leak ended up? Do you? The Gulf cleaned itself pure in no time flat. The ocean knows how to EAT oil. God (or someone) made it that way... to eat all the natural oil oozing from ocean floors every day. @poetwriterbeast @POTUS
584 2018-01-04 23:11:47 replacing diesel oil in gym 
585 2018-01-04 23:11:35 I’m obsessed with my new essential oil diffuser
586 2018-01-04 23:11:30 For instance, Jerry Brown wants to allow drilling for oil in the Pacific and now Trump is greenlighting it. We need to stop that from happening. Raise taxes on companies who want to drill here? Make it not worth it......
587 2018-01-04 23:11:08 I just use coastal scents black soap and follow up w tea tree oil
588 2018-01-04 23:11:02 Dude the oil has softened by beard up so well. Only thing I've found on par is a German beard oil that's nearly twice the price!
589 2018-01-04 23:10:51 On top of that he wants to hold us back by keeping us reliant on oil and coal when every other nation is moving forward. He is going to make us all poor!!!

596 2018-01-04 23:09:56 Elections matter. Even dumb ineffective Presidents like Donald Trump can do enormous damage...like opening up the waters off California for oil drilling. @JerryBrownGov can it be stopped? And to those who couldn’t see a difference between the GOP and Dems - still feel that way?
597 2018-01-04 23:09:47 Transporting illegal aliens into state or selling water with a dash of animal fecal matter for that extra kick  
598 2018-01-04 23:09:38 Racinboys until 7:30 pm Saturday and then mavtv/Lucas oil tv takes over.
599 2018-01-04 23:09:36 Doesn’t the price of oil affect oil and gas jobs more than anything? Also what the fuck is energy independence, so long as our energy is dependent on globally traded commodities that’s a fantasy, unless you want to give up on free trade.
600 2018-01-04 23:09:36 But the oil industry predicts hundreds of jobs!!
601 2018-01-04 23:09:33 Horrible. So there’s a glut of oil. The world is reducing use of fossil fuels - so let’s go drill off shore.
602 2018-01-04 23:09:28 LOL. The original Astroturf group funded by the Koch Bros and the oil industry. Their figures are always in dispute because they cherry pick. Their numbers are full-on propaganda.
603 2018-01-04 23:09:28 Baba Yaga waited awhile; then she flung down the cat, "you've never poured oil on us."
604 2018-01-04 23:09:25 Get some black seed oil.
605 2018-01-04 23:09:24 Needs more banana and hot oil.
606 2018-01-04 23:09:17 There is no way in hell that California is going to allow oil drilling to be established off the coast. It’s a threat to the environment and the economy!
607 2018-01-04 23:09:10 How does this make America first?  The oil is sold to whoever offers the most money for it.  Oil companies reap the profits and if there's a spill taxpayers pay to clean it up. Is that your idea of America first?
608 2018-01-04 23:09:08 IKYFL, that lil nigga was so fat that water gotta be 50% oil by now
609 2018-01-04 23:09:05 d moral is u mus ave sense before u try kill ppl,kerosene oil removes glue or almost any other adhesive
610 2018-01-04 23:08:59 English plss.
611 2018-01-04 23:08:47 Actually much more Big Oil and Gas money went through the Sierra Club.
612 2018-01-04 23:08:45 Is there some secret shortage of oil that the other 70% of us don’t know about?
613 2018-01-04 23:08:40 Well could you imagine having that type of money and only being able to spend it on better horse and carriages or better oil lamps. Lol
614 2018-01-04 23:08:36 Don’t open up more of our coastal lands for oil drilling @realDonaldTrump #MAGA right ¿ Oh and stand up! & behind! your word of ensuring states rights. Keep legalized cannabis and the rights.
615 2018-01-04 23:08:35 No this is horrible. Why drill around Florida or California? Why lower the price of the oil we can sell from Oklahoma, if there is drilling all over the US?  This won’t help the US and it won’t help OK
616 2018-01-04 23:08:16 You get what you pay for - as in the Gulf Coast’s elected officials got paid to ignore the risks. Cali ain’t gonna let a handful of oil billionaires strong arm their carpet bag legislation into our clean future!
617 2018-01-04 23:08:15 I used to work for an environmental lab during the BP oil spill and the overtime was awesome.
618 2018-01-04 23:08:12 More silly distractions while Trump prepares to auction off almost all of our country’s coastal waters to oil & gas companies for drilling. My region relies on tourism- because where I live is magnificently beautiful. Oil spills crush the economies of coastal cities and towns.
619 2018-01-04 23:08:10 I'll admit that now I'm like...what else can I dip in oil
620 2018-01-04 23:07:59 From a couple guys who have no oil- wisco and Montana are impacted ? Oil spill ? Wtf
621 2018-01-04 23:07:58 Theatrics to sell books. They are snake oil salesmen.
622 2018-01-04 23:07:57 Neither Trump nor corrupted by Big Oil Republicans give a damn about what people want or pristine coasts. It's like complaining that smuggling booze undermines law and order to Al Capone.
623 2018-01-04 23:07:56 Have a little amount of something healthy , i have just eaten one .. yes one ..  oven baked home made potato wedge ( no oil)  i made earlier . just to take the edge off my hunger and avoid a crazy binge when i cant sleep.
624 2018-01-04 23:07:52 If I see oil on Oregon’s coast I will drive my car (with irony) into Donald trumps face
625 2018-01-04 23:07:50 Oil doesn’t hydrate... it may assist w/ retaining moisture.
626 2018-01-04 23:07:37 That’s what is wrong with the Dem they don’t like the hard working oil and gas workers. I say Drill baby Drill

629 2018-01-04 23:07:22 You'll need to add oil or butter.
630 2018-01-04 23:07:01 Good we need that energy instead of foreign oil. Chuck cheap energy is good for NY. You wrong.
631 2018-01-04 23:06:49 Oatmeal baths and omega 3 oil (tablespoon on food) you can get special oatmeal shampoo too. Also look at diet and see if there’s any tweaks that could help, grain free for eg. 
632 2018-01-04 23:06:33 Oh and also took supplements - prenatal, fish oil, zinc, coq10, probiotic, vitamin e. Ugh it seems like a lot when it’s written down! But anything that might help I thought, why not. Fingers crossed for you 
633 2018-01-04 23:06:24 Rockefeller was so rich that they'd to split his oil company into different companies. Those companies are currently some of the biggest companies in the world.
634 2018-01-04 23:06:22 Just cracked open my first bottle of Body Hero oil wash by .@glossier and took a deep inhale — damn, y’all!! Has Tom Ford smelled this?!  #NeroliPortofinoForYourVaJay

636 2018-01-04 23:06:19 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.
637 2018-01-04 23:06:18 @SavageNation  in answer to ur question, drilling makes good sense because every time we talk about it, the price of middle eastern oil goes down. For starters.
638 2018-01-04 23:06:12 Conjugate margin of Mauritania & Senegal, with some recent large, interesting oil and gas finds. That boosts the E Coast over perceptions of a year or more ago. But eastern GoM seems a bigger near-term prize
639 2018-01-04 23:06:03 you and your oil checks
640 2018-01-04 23:05:57 When you got that oil money and became a team in the league but I'll stop
641 2018-01-04 23:05:55 Lol yes. In fact we have so much energy that we have to import it, large gas reserves as well as oil. The whole thing is a farce
642 2018-01-04 23:05:53 #WeirdestChildhoodMemory
the smell of baby oil....don't ask I'll have nightmares
643 2018-01-04 23:05:52 I use mineral oil with some argan oil a few times a week, and it works, but think I need to go all in.
644 2018-01-04 23:05:46 Trump moves to expand oil drilling off the California coast
645 2018-01-04 23:05:45 Improving oil refining capabilities via expansion or construction of new refineries should be strategy. This would create 10’s of thousands of jobs & within 15 years US would be self sufficient
646 2018-01-04 23:05:36 Pours Olbas Oil on shirt for bedtime, not necessarily because I have a cold but by God, what a beautiful aroma
647 2018-01-04 23:05:32 Producing more oil will not make the US energy independent because Americans don't own the oil. Govt lease land oil companies drill the oil and sell it to the highest bidder. We export oil learn the truth.
648 2018-01-04 23:05:28 If youu kne w anytbing about solar and batteries you would know that those are not the answer.. coal and oil are the near future and using them better.
649 2018-01-04 23:05:22 Who said somethin bout oil bitch you cookin?
650 2018-01-04 23:05:17 Apparently Gavin has never driven up the pacific coast hwy and looked at all the oil platforms already just off the coast
651 2018-01-04 23:05:16 Midnight Oil - Beds Are Burning
652 2018-01-04 23:05:16 I hope y’all put the coconut oil away and bought out the Shea butter this winter
653 2018-01-04 23:05:14 oh ok. The cauli you just toss in some olive oil, and steam for about 10 minutes x
654 2018-01-04 23:05:11 Great I guess the Tax law was not enough.  Do we really need the additional oil.  Maybe the overage will be used to keep his hair in place.
655 2018-01-04 23:04:54 Veg oil pulse jet?
656 2018-01-04 23:04:53 If only you knew how NOT SCARED I was. The oil light on so you ain’t about to do much sis
657 2018-01-04 23:04:52 awwwwww
658 2018-01-04 23:04:48 He doesn't give a rat's whisker about the Iranian protesters. IMHO - he will send U.S. troops in as a favor to Muhammad bin Salman in Saudi.  MBS doesn't want the oil competition. Rumor is Trump accepted $1Bn from MBS last May.  If U.S. goes in Iran God knows when we'll leave.
659 2018-01-04 23:04:46 Your party is owned by big oil. Why would you expect anything less than a raping of our natural resources to fulfill their bottom line? Appreciate your concern of environmental effects, but check the party you’ve chosen to be a part of.
660 2018-01-04 23:04:41 Amen! We don’t need more oil we want & need clean energy. Trump & Team are money grabbers who have to be stopped because the damage they will do to all we have done to protect our ocean habitats will be wiped out for nothing. #NoOffShoreDrilling
661 2018-01-04 23:04:28 Burning the midnight oil, the sunlight/ daylight & EVERYTHING in between working on my book. Im EXHAUSTED. I NEED !!
662 2018-01-04 23:04:21 Ok, so what, exactly are you going to do about the situation? You've already sold us out for oil. Why should we have any hope you'll do the right thing now?
663 2018-01-04 23:04:16 Do you put oil in the water when you cook noodles so they don't stick together? Asking for a friend
664 2018-01-04 23:04:15 Well bless your heart, I have been pumping my own gas, check and CHANGING my own oil and washing my windshield for 30yrs. I dont think there is a staion who pumps your gas for you in East Tx I never have seen any in over 15yrs
665 2018-01-04 23:04:15 Have you been in hibernation? NDP took over AFTER oil price crash, massive job losses, and at bottom of recession. And with about a 1000 way overdue things that needed doing. PC mismanagemed our oil revenue for decades.
666 2018-01-04 23:04:11 Only had 3 to do list things recommended for my car during my oil change. Somehow this feels like winning.
667 2018-01-04 23:04:08 But you don’t need the benefit of the cbd oil created from the plant to cure a medical condition that normal medicine can’t fix chemotherapy does not cure cancer but cbd  sure can and that oil comes from pot
668 2018-01-04 23:04:02 Here's my public comment NO NEW OIL DRILLING OFF OUR COASTS the oceans belong to the planet not this corrupt government
669 2018-01-04 23:04:01 Therefore return Kachukwu to nnpc n allow him reorganized managmt to solve our problems n plan for local refine of crude oil for consumptn.
670 2018-01-04 23:03:52 Abundance of oil in US is not the problem..actually plenty here for thousands of years at current consumption rate. Thus, offshore drilling does not help!
671 2018-01-04 23:03:51 So where are the new sea based oil refineries going to be located? 
672 2018-01-04 23:03:47 Oooorrr... it’s just another example that our president will stop at nothing to lower our energy costs and more importantly, reduce our dependence on oil from countries who hate us. But hey, by all means...keep on trying to shape the perspectives of your sheep.

675 2018-01-04 23:03:41 Apologies for typo (1970s), but gives opportunity to expand. The Ford administration considered climate change a major threat, a position that led to kick back by oil interests to discredit the evidence. Sound familiar?
676 2018-01-04 23:03:38 Olive oil is my superbowl.
677 2018-01-04 23:03:36 Anyone want Oil tickets for tonight? $150/pair. Somewhere in the upper deck. DM me if yes.
678 2018-01-04 23:03:33 IT'S ABOUT TIME !! OIL DRILLING HAS BECOME THE SAFEST AND CLEANEST WAY OF USING OUR FOSSIL FUELS AND WE HAVE MORE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD ----------- WHY NOT "USE IT" ???
679 2018-01-04 23:03:29 BIG PHARMA WILL LOVE THIS! CBD OIL IS REALLY GOOD FOR PAIN AND INFLAMMATION. IT IS ALSO GOOD FOR ANIEXY DISORDER. DON’T LET THEM TAKE IT AWAY!!
680 2018-01-04 23:03:14 UN spends billions to develop tourism industry, but % of profits go to each Gaza resident like oil revenue flows to residents of Alaska
681 2018-01-04 23:03:08 No doubt the regime will do whatever it has to make the oil workers go back to work, death threats have always been common in #iran especially for oil which is the heart of the mullahs
682 2018-01-04 23:03:07 Wen my mums money gets missing she'll tell us she's gone to babalawo. Babalawo says if she puts our hand in hot oil and it burns Nani take am it it doesn't u are free.  Na u go confess. Smh!
683 2018-01-04 23:03:03 I knew from the unset the whole scarcity stuff was a deliberate sabotage by both govt and markets 2 justify another increase in price.
Jonathan remove subsidy from oil & was still sold at 141 & Buhari remove subsidy and is selling at 145.
Between JET & PMB how much is crude oil?
684 2018-01-04 23:03:01 How many women you know are willing to cover themselves with engine oil from head to toe 9 hrs a day? Bullshit article at its best
685 2018-01-04 23:02:59 The @NEPowerGen New England Power Grid is in CHAOS, unsafe nuclear plant forced to SCRAM, Dirty Expensive Oil as the primary generation, clean, efficient natural gas plants offline due to nimby stonewall. Clean inexpensive natural gas only 200 miles away. Chaos continues.
686 2018-01-04 23:02:59 They'll be out by the time oil slicks foul Florida beaches or the Maine coast.
687 2018-01-04 23:02:54 何とかなった
688 2018-01-04 23:02:51 Crude oil up to over $60 a barrel.  We can’t take these increases in gas prices especially in this cold.  He needs to #RESIGN
689 2018-01-04 23:02:49 Sleep is very important to a person's well-being ,don't try to fight what comes  naturally ,if you have problems try some lavender oil on pillow will help!  I suffer from insomnia and this helps me most times, good luck !
690 2018-01-04 23:02:47 @SecretaryZinke The oceans belong to the entire planet. Keep you corrupt hands off! NO NEW OIL DRILLING.
691 2018-01-04 23:02:46 DRILL FOR OIL WHEREVER the hell you want.  Put pot smokers with seizures or PTSD back in jail.  Be the only nation not in The Paris Accord. (Screw the Earth, it's old).  If Democrats decide to run Genghis Khan, he'll be to the Left of this gang.  #Enough #MakeItStop

695 2018-01-04 23:02:41 I’m thinking Red Arrows-style smoke trails. Just add oil?
696 2018-01-04 23:02:40 Hell, even cars meant for use in winter hate this insane cold. My Ford Fusion starts but boy does it grumble about it (and that’s with full synthetic oil and 91 octane ethanol free gas)
697 2018-01-04 23:02:30 Another benefit, maintenance costs much lower. No oil changes, spark plugs, timing belts, etc. Just wheel rotation & windshield washer fluid
698 2018-01-04 23:02:29 when they spill they must be held financially responsible for cleaning up every single drop of oil.
699 2018-01-04 23:02:26 Ooh, I will check it out. I actually bought Emma an essential oil kit for Christmas because she’s into it! Will have to see if she has that one. Thanks Tam! 
700 2018-01-04 23:02:23 @AllOutShow shout out from the Texas oil fields!!! Keep it rolling
701 2018-01-04 23:02:17 Alyssaji, Sewers aside, wd hv bn better if a paragraph or 2 were included on how experts think electric car industry will change traditional car manufacturing. Jobs related to manufacture & repair of Transmission, Engines, oil replacement etc. will go while SW related will grow.
702 2018-01-04 23:02:10 40 yrs lifelong Alaskans like me have fought against offshore drilling for oil/gas Zinkie came here 4 months ago to meet privately with CEO of Pebble Mine.They made an agreement to open Pebble mine despite the fact it will destroy Bristol Bay largest Wild salmon spawning grounds

707 2018-01-04 23:00:54 Time to get off of the oil
708 2018-01-04 23:00:49 Unknowledgable others?
There is only one unknowledgable person here and its the person with 5 accounts aggravating and peddling their snake oil to #pwme !!!
709 2018-01-04 23:00:45 OI, PRESIDENT. OIL IS OBSOLETE. STOP EXPANDING OFFSHORE DRILLING, BROH.
710 2018-01-04 23:00:42 a city fan bemoaning a need for oil?
711 2018-01-04 23:00:36 Oil drilling wastewater is used to grow food in CA, loaded with chemicals used in fossil fuel extraction. Food cos that market their brands as “healthy” are involved in this too, including Grimmway Farms, a major U.S. carrot producer, including “Bunny-Luv” Carrots, says OCA
712 2018-01-04 23:00:35 Suncor, Teck Buy Part of Total Stake in Canada Oil Sands Mine
713 2018-01-04 23:00:32 @realDougBell Doug. I heard that Trump is going to roll back regulations banning off shore drilling. I am thoroughly against this because of the environmental hazards and it is being done for the sole purpose of enriching the oil companies.
714 2018-01-04 23:00:26 OIL DIFF: 6.36 -> 6.43
715 2018-01-04 23:00:24 #Mexico: after three oil discoveries #Eni could put on stream Area 1 by mid-2019. The country's opening of its upstream to foreign investors is rapidly bearing fruit.
716 2018-01-04 23:00:11 Crude oil up again today — over $60 a barrel.  This impacts all Americans.  #RESIGN
717 2018-01-04 23:00:07 This is incorrect. Offshore drilling works wonders and is better for the environment than letting natural oil leaks wreak natural havoc. Rigs to reefs creates biodiversity plus less oil in the ocean, how do you not support this?

720 2018-01-04 22:59:57 Get First Nations in on profits from development of Fossil fuels and pipelines, there will be oil gluts on east and west coast
721 2018-01-04 22:59:42 Coconut oil.
722 2018-01-04 22:59:34 COCONUT OIL  
723 2018-01-04 22:59:33 Meanwhile, Florida Governor Rick Scott (sadly, my governor) licked his lips like an oil baron (after licking Trump's boots) and contemplated all the ways he'd make money from this deal.
724 2018-01-04 22:59:22 Why on Earth, in a time where renewable sustainable clean energy is ripe for the picking would Trump want to drill for oil in our already fractured and fragile oceans? It makes no sense, just like his Presidency.
725 2018-01-04 22:59:00 Yes.  SUPER KRILL OIL and JOINT WARFARE from @Originlabsusa
726 2018-01-04 22:58:43 If you or a loved one needed it for chronic pain or #Cannabis oil to reduce seizures you might become “pro-pot”. I say #LegalizeIt nationwide just like alcohol and tax and regulate. Leaving it up to the states leaves out millions who may live in the wrong place
727 2018-01-04 22:58:43 @quisharose i tried this thing where you eat coconut oil and it reduces cramps and shortens your period. just helping a gal out xoxo
728 2018-01-04 22:58:37 Since he’s doing this to East &West coasts he might not understand that FL, GA, SC &!NC voted for him.  Fishermen and families that love vacations at the beach might not b too happy if they r fouled esp since deregulating means oil co cut back on safety. Deepwater Horizon anyone?
729 2018-01-04 22:58:36 Not surprising.  Florida's primary source of income is their beaches.  Anything that could even possibly have a negative impact on their beaches would be a no go.  On the other hand, the outer continental shelf is a LONG way offshore and Gulf Stream would carry oil north.
730 2018-01-04 22:58:35 More oil spills, more tainted ecosystems, more lost fishing jobs from polluted water, more money spent cleaning up water. Got it.
731 2018-01-04 22:58:34 But I Appreciate This Harmathan And The Broke Me Tho, All I Do Is Stay Home, Drink More Water, Rub Coconut Oil On My Connected Beard, Eat & Swear For My Debtors
732 2018-01-04 22:58:19 If you cared about the Future of the USA. You would think AHEAD. Suck all the Oil you can from the Rest of the World. Then tap ours. In meantime try to regain the world leadership in Solar etc. That you have allowed Trump to squander.
733 2018-01-04 22:58:16 Great point. Offshore wind infrastructure is a separate leasing regimen however and does not require pre-existence of oil and gas infrastructure. Equipment substantially different and hotspots for resource don't always match up.
734 2018-01-04 22:58:07 When you hotbox your car the night before you come for an oil change & everyone telling you how good your car smells 
735 2018-01-04 22:58:05 We should drill for oil. Every other country does it and been doing it for a long time!!! We need to catch up with the rest of the world and get energy independent!!!!
736 2018-01-04 22:58:01 あなたの心臓を鉄製のエンジンに交換します。排気ガスはわずかしか出ません。お値段今ならお安く55万円！という訪問販売がきて、実際に装着した人が力仕事でも何でもバリバリやるところを見せられる、、、、

という夢を見た。
心臓ヤバいのかな？ﾊﾟﾀﾘorz
737 2018-01-04 22:57:51 you have all that oil and you have a fuel crisis.
738 2018-01-04 22:57:42 Before the auctioning of the environment starts, I hope the powers that be are looking into Trump's links with oil giants within and outside the US, perhaps even in Aberdeen
739 2018-01-04 22:57:41 What would it mean if we could build a microscopic oil refinery on a solar cell?
740 2018-01-04 22:57:18 Uh huh.  Well-reasoned, as usual.  Compare calling for equal justice to "squealing".  Then "squeal" for it yourself.  Then accuse me of supporting killing cops.  WHAT???
741 2018-01-04 22:57:18 We should be using a fraction of the oil we were 20 years ago, instead we are using more, denying the reality of new energy technology.
742 2018-01-04 22:56:48 #Trump will waive the sanctions except that he will not waive the old executive order which freezes the Central Bank of Iran's assets overseas. So #Iran can continue selling oil, but it can't repatriate the payments. It has to spend it on food and medicine.
743 2018-01-04 22:56:43 Seriously an hour an half for a fricken oil change
744 2018-01-04 22:56:42 Highlighter then baby oil
745 2018-01-04 22:56:40 What a lap dog for Big Oil & Koch Industry a Grover N. is.
Sad
746 2018-01-04 22:56:40 Might i recommend investing in #Wind and #Solar power as well?  When it comes to cars, I suggest investing in #Biofuels so when the oil runs out we're not caught with our pants down.  Oil's fine and all, but when it's gone, that's it.
747 2018-01-04 22:56:36 Finalmente, para la operativa más táctica, las tendencias que estamos viendo en las Hard Commodities, son tremendas. Destaca el movimiento bestial del Heating Oil y la ruptura acual de los metales: palladio, platino, oro y la plata. Al cobre vamos tarde...
748 2018-01-04 22:56:35 True, if 70% of LFC fans who are in Liverpool are not happy, it becomes a problem cz that will mean empty seats in Anfield and it will look like emptyHard like that empty stadium in Manchester City & not good for business unless you got oil money and don't know what to do with it
749 2018-01-04 22:56:32 In Biloxi then, I remember the smell that permeated the air, blobs of oil washing up on the beach, the damage to the fishing and seafood business, and the blow to tourism that was just coming back after Katrina. I will not forget.
750 2018-01-04 22:56:29 Are you serious effing snake oil salesman.
751 2018-01-04 22:56:21 It seems Rs bleat about state rights to protect voter suppression, racist policies but are happy to force gun laws, oil drilling down states throats.
752 2018-01-04 22:56:20 I started flipping my routine. Condition first then shampoo, using a hair mask once a week, plus keratin oil before I blow dry which I think is helping!
753 2018-01-04 22:56:12 結局終わってない
754 2018-01-04 22:56:09 It’s about time to start those oil rigs pumping
755 2018-01-04 22:56:02 Yeah I do mostly natural stuff so try a honey & sugar scrub. And for oily skin, out a few drops of tea tree oil in the mixture and for dry skin a few drops of virgin olive oil
756 2018-01-04 22:55:47 I’m from Texas and this news is certainly worrying.  I’ve witnessed oil spills and their devastating damage to both human life and wildlife.  You don’t have to dig a deep hole on many Texas beaches before you run into oil.  It’s also full of carcinogens so the effect is lasting.
757 2018-01-04 22:55:45 The feds are coming for your weed and to drill for oil on your coastlines.
758 2018-01-04 22:55:40 So drilling for oil is ok as long as it’s in the Middle East?
759 2018-01-04 22:55:29 It's so helpful! Also try to add a little peppermint oil if you're at work, it's energizing!
760 2018-01-04 22:55:25 Oil money talks. Same for UT and T A&M. Mizzou doesnt have wealthy oil rich alumni's. Mizzou should have stayed in Big 12.
761 2018-01-04 22:55:22 His base could not spot a snake oil salesman.
762 2018-01-04 22:55:19 @Artistc_License how do I clean my oil diffuser?
763 2018-01-04 22:55:19 update: I can finally eat cooked food again, but nothing with oil or fat for now. My dinner tonight was chicken with white rice which, after 2 days of only tea and toasts, tasted pretty fucking good :3
764 2018-01-04 22:55:17 Walked in to get my oil change and literally I was the only car here and they started working on my car immediately. That never happens for me! Well....until today.
765 2018-01-04 22:55:05 I'm sick we have to buy oil from the middle east countries that rob us blind. If we have the assets we need to use them but also hold the companies doing the drilling accountable for any & all spillage that occurs. It will cost us less if we use our own oil.
766 2018-01-04 22:55:03 I can see 13 oil rigs on my 40 minute drive north on 101 to Santa Barbara and who knows how many are out there that I can't see. It's already an environmental disaster waiting to happen.
767 2018-01-04 22:55:03 Fresh oil change, air filter, alignment, rotate and balance 
768 2018-01-04 22:55:02 79 million acres Gulf of Mx Trump and Zinke gave up for oil leases! Even including the large dead zone in Gulf!
769 2018-01-04 22:54:59 I know ugh sucks that cities would get revitalized. Uhn. If only there was tech out there to clean up oil spills. Damn.
770 2018-01-04 22:54:41 Need someone to come rub this oil in my back
771 2018-01-04 22:54:40 Despite low oil prices and interest rate @Delta has not outperformed. Do not see how it will do any better with increasing interest rate, unfriendly White House, bad winter storms.  via @benzinga
772 2018-01-04 22:54:31 Everyone wants to complain (not in my backyard) but refuses to give up their reliance on fossil fuel mainly oil.

You really don't think other countries produce energy as cleanly and as safe for the environment as the United States. I don't think so.

773 2018-01-04 22:54:25 Full tank of gas and topped off my oil. #expensivedate
774 2018-01-04 22:54:19 We had oil delivered today and in the three hours since the guy has been here, you can no longer see his foot prints #BombCyclone.
775 2018-01-04 22:54:12 Drilling is actually Regulated more by oil composite than the government requires.   Companies are using many safeguards to ensure this.   Cannot afford another Macondo.   You'd be amazed what is being done offshore around the world.
776 2018-01-04 22:54:10 No #oil drilling off #California's coast. Not now. Not ever. @realDonaldTrump @RyanZinke @Interior #environment #saveourcoast #nodrilling @coastalcommish
777 2018-01-04 22:54:08 Oil filter
778 2018-01-04 22:53:58 I hope you have moved your investments in oil to other none money making ventures as we are all certain you wouldn’t want to capitalize on anything that our president has done
779 2018-01-04 22:53:53 Tonight I sautéed button mushrooms in coconut oil, added tinned chic peas, chilli flakes, tbs of wheat free shoyu, turmeric, @yeovalley double cream. Butter. Yeast flakes. I would have added micro greens at the end. Next time. #veggiebliss
780 2018-01-04 22:53:47 Getting this oil change and tire rotation will be the death of me 
781 2018-01-04 22:53:47 Props to for letting a guy using motor oil.
782 2018-01-04 22:53:42 I have these cute little potatoes I should roast them yeah? Olive oil and salt and crushed garlic  and some crazy Penseys seasoning?
783 2018-01-04 22:53:41 Hash gets a pass though right? And thc oil you can vape!
784 2018-01-04 22:53:41 Hahaha WTF do you know about the oil industry??? It's ok for China to drill in our waters but not us???
785 2018-01-04 22:53:40 People corny hating on the oil
786 2018-01-04 22:53:39 Because the price of oil is not low enough.  It's not just about spills.  It's about leaving it in the ground or under the ocean.
787 2018-01-04 22:53:38 coconut oil and rosewater are the literal two best things to ever happen to my face. bless the good lord.
788 2018-01-04 22:53:34 Olive oil with 2-3 drops of tea tree oil
789 2018-01-04 22:53:30 Gotttaaaa get my tea tree oil tomorrow 
790 2018-01-04 22:53:27 If oil industry were truly dying, then why should Al Gore care?
791 2018-01-04 22:53:09 @realDonaldTrump MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! My son had a brain tumor that went away from cannabis oil. #brain #tumor #gone @opera @TheEllenShow #LEGALIZE
792 2018-01-04 22:53:09 Mar a Lago needs an oil well obstructing the view.  A spill would definitely lower its value.  Drill baby drill.
793 2018-01-04 22:53:06 11h oil me semble
794 2018-01-04 22:52:52 Sunshine State. Solar, no more oil!!  Go Bill!!
795 2018-01-04 22:52:46 it was a slight culture shock when I first went out of state and saw people pumping their own gas. I always thought it was an actual job that you had to train for lol #TheFive and then in addition to pumping they'd also clean your windshield and check your oil as a courtesy
796 2018-01-04 22:52:40 i genuinely don’t know lmao but 

face oil before or after moisturizer??

798 2018-01-04 22:52:33 .@realDonaldTrump I’ve never agreed with you on anything except the urgent need to wean ourselves off dependence on Middle East oil. As a result, we urgently and bigly need to drill for oil in our own shores/lands. Energy security = national security. Let’s expedite this process!

A dangerous assignment.
802 2018-01-04 22:52:17 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!
803 2018-01-04 22:52:09 Oil marks appear on walls where pleasure moments hung before
804 2018-01-04 22:52:08 For natural beauty things I always carry is rose water toner and coconut oil :3
805 2018-01-04 22:52:04 You've just said "it's all about oil we need loads of it"
806 2018-01-04 22:51:50 Remember, Flint was from lead leaching from the pipes. Nothing to do with oil. Not drinking sea water. Are you?
807 2018-01-04 22:51:48 I’m sure that the oil companies are jumping for joy! Can you imagine the view now for all the beachside homes, lol. Not to mention the pollution. Great for real estate prices too, lol!
808 2018-01-04 22:51:45 mmm orange oil
809 2018-01-04 22:51:45 How long will your oil burn when the time comes?
810 2018-01-04 22:51:42 should’ve asked for castor oil as a Christmas prezzie x
811 2018-01-04 22:51:39 The Trump administration wants to do more prosecutions for marijuana - even in states where it's legal - and do more drilling for oil offshore. This seems backwards to me - should be less of each.
812 2018-01-04 22:51:28 What’s wrong with America’s oil maybe we will make a profit and pay done the debt
813 2018-01-04 22:51:27 //I need to grab some food then change my oil

Ugh

Adulting sucks
814 2018-01-04 22:51:18 @realDonaldTrump President Trump...we are hurting here in Maine with the oil prices that have skyrocketed over a two week period..having a blizzard here now!  A week ago I paid $260 a gallon for 100 gals, today all of the oil prices have gone up and now$290 for 100 gals. HELP!
815 2018-01-04 22:51:11 Yeah! But I'm oil form, when I get anxious I diffuse lavender at home or if I'm out I just dab a little on my wrist and neck
816 2018-01-04 22:51:10 SI se confirma este tramo alcista de las cíclicas, se cumpliría a la perfección la rotación sectorial del ciclo, siendo la etapa final, la de las cíclicas(Oil&Gas y Basic Materials) y Small and Mid Cap.
817 2018-01-04 22:50:53 Had this couple come over to me and Hug me... Thought I was a relative of theirs! to top it off coming out the lift today doors open & this woman just screamed, I mean in no oil painting but I'm not that bad 
818 2018-01-04 22:50:52 you can't prepare by force. society literally runs on oil. When there is a cost effectv means ppl will pounce.
819 2018-01-04 22:50:48 Let’s get that oil pumping
820 2018-01-04 22:50:46 @jeffsessions  you just think because a black man paved the way for states to gain profit and make the economy some what stable you have to take that away cause you’re probably one of those fuckers who has money in the paper industry or the oil industry and realized marijuana;

Drilling for oil and gas off Virginia's shores:
Support 45%
Oppose 38%
(Suffolk U. Poll, LV, 10/30 - 11/1/17)
823 2018-01-04 22:50:28 Was reading about Shell and drilling oil in Antarctica
824 2018-01-04 22:50:25 this the funniest news ever. The whole world knows the data is more valuable than oil or land, Indians can be fooled in big numbers. And they realise few hundred years later, we were ruled and looted by such and such Mughals, British whatever.
825 2018-01-04 22:50:20 I like, I mean I love the environment as much as anyone can.  I’ve spent a lot of time enjoying it throughout my life.  But whining about drilling for oil is like eating meat but hating those who kill the animal. 
826 2018-01-04 22:50:16 Healthier lives? Really Bob? U have supported lifting regulations guaranteeing clean air, water etc & course Trump letting Oil copr desecrate FL & CA coastal waters & shores- do you care about that at all? Or just happy with the $ you pocketed from approving the #GOPTaxScam
827 2018-01-04 22:50:15 Sin embargo, lo que queda más claro tras repasar los sectores de RV, es que el mercado pide a GRITOS cíclicas. La rotación sectorial está servida. Ahora arranca OIL & GAS. Tan solo mirar la vela enorme de XOM
828 2018-01-04 22:50:14 i love the rosehip oil!!! and i have the lactic acid but i haven't used it enough to report on it lol
829 2018-01-04 22:50:11 Dirty expensive Oil is the Number one generator in New England.
830 2018-01-04 22:50:09 MONEY for PUTINS Oil dreams!
831 2018-01-04 22:50:03 HaHaHaHa.  Mar-A-Oil-Spill.
832 2018-01-04 22:50:00 .@SeanHannity Libs/media slobbering over Bannon/Trump feud, .@POTUS passes oil drilling, 250k more back in the workforce…#MAGA… TODAY
833 2018-01-04 22:49:56 Didn't the Klampits call oil "Black Gold"? Hmmm....
834 2018-01-04 22:49:53 Energy goes against oil co interest, Wall St regulation, living  wages that allow ppl to save for their retirement, tuition free college more progressive income taxes.

None of these happens when moneyed interests r allowed to influence politics.
835 2018-01-04 22:49:52 Im gonna watch the game tonight with the wif and kids. Got any #mccainwedges @tvnatasha ? #oil
836 2018-01-04 22:49:51 Dangerous and irresponsible come to mind. Both DJT and OCS action, so yes let’s focus on how dangerous DJT is. It’s 2018 let’s move on from oil and coal. LET’S LEAD on this.
837 2018-01-04 22:49:49 The other night, I emptied a few drops of lavender oil into a candle. The flame did a small "poof"...I felt like a "real" witch!! lol
838 2018-01-04 22:49:35 Oil drilling off Florida's coasts could cause environmental disasters and concurrently damage tourism.  Yet why did Cubelo vote Yes for Trump's Tax Scheme?
839 2018-01-04 22:49:17 We just put out the Peak Extracts CBD Cartridges(2:1 or High CBD!) as well as their Sativa Fruit Punch cart! Same oil used in the Peak Bar!

847 2018-01-04 22:48:45 Why so hard for y'all to see there is no practical reason behind the Trump/Sessions knife to Obama pot law other than jealou$Trump means2deliberately undermine the solar industry and the billion dollar pot industry that shames oil execs'profits @hickforco @MaddowBlog @chucktodd
848 2018-01-04 22:48:42 @TheFive Geraldos stupid pot argument is like cars burn more gas if they speed, so lets ignore speed laws because we can employ more people in the oil industry

852 2018-01-04 22:48:16 aloe and tea tree oil have saved my life!
853 2018-01-04 22:48:16 China has what's estimated 2 b biggest oil deposits. Russia prob world's largest gold deposits. They want out from under US dollars. Hard to explain but if interested read up on Bretton Woods & petro $
854 2018-01-04 22:48:07 Think Antifa or #resistance is troubling. Really going after Hillary would cause much worse. 
#MeToo #antifa #resistance #occupy ×10 +
855 2018-01-04 22:48:05 I really enjoyed seeing the pictures and maps in this moment, but I have to say, as a veteran of the Prudhoe Bay oil fields, none of those pictures looked very tundra-like. Pictures of the tundra, in winter, are usually kind of blank and white, with no features anywhere...nothing
856 2018-01-04 22:47:58 Sounds like olive oil is best. Extra virgin
857 2018-01-04 22:47:53 So turn off your electricity in all your homes, stop driving your car and flying on aircrafts since that oil and gas is what powers all of these.
858 2018-01-04 22:47:36 @SRuhle ‘Richard Branson is dyslexic’. Too good. The Mooch-what a phony. He’s the reason people dislike wall street. Oozes oil.
859 2018-01-04 22:47:33 lol wake up cal mate, WE NEED OIL AND LOTS OF IT. If you are Lab supporters and are denouncing Blair you need to have a long hard look at yourself. 3 election wins, rebuilt schools and NHS. Grow up
860 2018-01-04 22:47:33 I'm boiling a pot of water to add humidity to the apartment and I added rosewater, vanilla and cedar essential oil. Highly recommended.
861 2018-01-04 22:47:32 Thank you Senator Rubio for showing some common sense and fighting this sell out to the oil and gas industry.  How many times do we have to clean up the Gulf.  This should not be a partisan issue and I would hope Senator Nelson and our Congressmen from both parties will fight it.
862 2018-01-04 22:47:28 Just spilled castor oil everywhere 
863 2018-01-04 22:47:23 Lol.  Richard Charnin, a guy with a WordPress blog about JFK conspiracies.  That's a helluva source 
864 2018-01-04 22:47:18 Don’t worry, we know and checked :) We got an all natural one from Walmart. Just peanuts, sugar, palm oil, and salt.
865 2018-01-04 22:47:14 You after sucking oil off these tits: "bone app the tit, compliments to the chef"
866 2018-01-04 22:47:11 full on oil and all switches checked  but thank you so much!!!
867 2018-01-04 22:47:11 All guys want the same thing: to kill their mentor/mother figure in the jungles of Russia, assume the title of Big Boss, form a paramilitary group on an oil rig, make your combat medic into a body double, lay low for 8 years, build a different mercenary company on another oil rig
868 2018-01-04 22:47:11 Me too!!! I'm vegan, use cruelty free beauty products, eco friendly cleaning products, eating mainly organic food, wear vegan clothes, recycle and defo avoiding any place that has got to do anything with animal exploitation! Also only consume ethically sourced coconut oil too 
869 2018-01-04 22:47:10 China & Russia want to allow nations to buy oil with their gold-backed rubles & yuan to weaken the US $. US petro dollar holds nations hostage. Best to read up on this. Risk is posed 2 r economy. Right now USD required 2 buy oil in most cases.
870 2018-01-04 22:47:06 So you expect poorer teams not owned by oil barons to stop being defensive and scratching for points? To willingly sacrifice themselves to the oil barons for the “good of the sport” even tho relegation would lead to possible financial meltdown due to loss of EPL tv money. What?
871 2018-01-04 22:47:05 Just a FYI THE WHITE HOUSE (DOJ) trumpbot thingie (Not all DOJ) is trying to Segway us with the marijuana, OIL DRILLING bad move btb book

874 2018-01-04 22:46:42 Exxon Valdez spilled 10.8 million gallons of crude oil. Seems like a large amount, right?
875 2018-01-04 22:46:34 Offshore oil drilling @realDonaldTrump really?? In places where we banned it? Bruh spend all that energy and time and money into renewable energy! Fucking wrinkly old rasin fucking up the earth...
876 2018-01-04 22:46:22 We are very nearly net exporters. Or dependence on Saudi oil is significantly reduced. We also export Nat gas which should increase as liquification tech improves
877 2018-01-04 22:46:14 Someone should set up an oil rig right next to mar a lago!
878 2018-01-04 22:46:08 There's oil in #Iran and the West wants regime change - no oil in #Rohingya !!
879 2018-01-04 22:46:03 Trump and his money grubbing filthy power hungry elitists will now oil drill our precious East Coast Fisheries out of existence. You stupid stupid people who put this crazy man in power.
880 2018-01-04 22:46:03 He sold our souls for oil..a pathological liar.. Promised Bush he would follow him into war whatever.
881 2018-01-04 22:45:58 Next Texoma Report: @StateImpactOK on how a longtime energy industry leader is working to raise oil and gas production taxes to help fund public education. ATC today, Morning Edition Friday!
882 2018-01-04 22:45:45 Pilgrim Nuclears long unreliable history during winter storms. Current power prices near $400.00 per MW, and the majority of power generated in New England is fueled by dirty oil. @NEPowerGen @CLF Need increased natural gas pipeline capacity now. Ratepayers subsidizing costly oil
883 2018-01-04 22:45:44 Didn't believe the essential oil hype but I'll be honest, it has improved my congestion. #ColdAndFluSeason
884 2018-01-04 22:45:38 Then don't live in a place that costs so much to live? I'm not going to try & live in Beverly Hills on an oil field jobs pay. So I live where my income can support my family. Again. Flipping burgers shouldn't be a job that pays enough to support a family. If it were, I wud do it.
885 2018-01-04 22:45:37 Lol. Kids use cbd oil to stop their seizures and it's bad? 80% of veterans approve of it. I guess Fuck them, right?
886 2018-01-04 22:45:37 @senrobportman Would you let oil companies drill in Ohio's coastal waters of Lake Erie?
887 2018-01-04 22:45:36 Unlock? Like this is some big accomplishment? We don't WANT to depend on Oil and Coal anymore. 

Then again, the election didn't listen to a majority of Americans, why should you lot?
888 2018-01-04 22:45:33 one time my friends were bragging about my cooking & a boy was all “ya well I’m gonna tell u the Italian secret for amazing pasta *whispers* olive oil in the water when u boil it” !DEAD SERIOUS! he thought boiling dry pasta was impressive & that he could teach me something lmfao
889 2018-01-04 22:45:29 Hmm...you don't care about your district so you must be afraid of an oil spill at your estate.
890 2018-01-04 22:45:27 I’m happier when my choices help us all reduce oil dependence, conserve water, and reduce waste sent to the landfill! #Rethinkplastic #plasticfree
891 2018-01-04 22:45:04 I wish you mentioned specific what he brought to life in agric sector? That's admin where cassava flour for industrial production was imported,palm oil too,over 98% of rice was imported,including toothpicks. There was a time I bought garri imported from Ghana.
892 2018-01-04 22:44:59 The only relief my mom has found from post neuralgia pain from shingles is cannibus oil. They wanted her on opiates we refused to let her take that and become a junkie. Does he just want to screw with the recreational use or all use? #fucksessions
893 2018-01-04 22:44:54 They’ve been bought off by big oil of course too.
894 2018-01-04 22:44:35 Is there any actual precedence for eminent domain being used to seize land which was then developed for oil mining/extraction, though? (I'm genuinely curious)
895 2018-01-04 22:44:35 You do realize that we are already energy independent, don’t you?  This only hurts us and helps the stock price of international oil corporations
896 2018-01-04 22:44:26 Bought some $AVE today. Low float oil play trading at .64. Fundamentals showing it's worth .81.

899 2018-01-04 22:44:06 Do you expect this would have an impact on oil prices in the mid term? I can't tell if enough would get drilled to move the needle​. I don't like it either way but seems odd for him to make an unnecessary move that would reduce oil prices with his support ($ and ppl) from energy.
900 2018-01-04 22:44:02 @realDonaldTrump ‘to become the strongest energy superpower’, you put your energy into the actual superpower, which is the sun, not oil. But what do baby boomers or POTUS care? #millenials will suffer the ramifications of destroyed environment and depleted resources. #childless
901 2018-01-04 22:44:02 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.
902 2018-01-04 22:43:57 And potentially: More oil spills, more risk to sea life, more ruined beaches, more tourism dollars lost, more high risk jobs. It’s not all butterflies and unicorns.
903 2018-01-04 22:43:53 And more oil leaks
904 2018-01-04 22:43:51 Can anyone recommend good quality high strength CBD oil/capsules brands available in UK for pain relief? I have fibromyalgia, and I’ve read CBD is quite effective.
905 2018-01-04 22:43:27 Look all I’m saying is who stands to gain from people thinking Bigfoot isn’t real? 
That’s right the govt and Big Oil.
906 2018-01-04 22:43:21 Coconut oil is some sorcery shit I swear
907 2018-01-04 22:43:19 Post shoveling recovery. 2 ounces Fish Oil, CBD’s, chicken chili and a shit ton of water #snowday2018

909 2018-01-04 22:43:16 No, we aren’t discussing that. We were discussing your propagation of the fallacy that oil is good. 
Your conversation has become a loop 
910 2018-01-04 22:43:14 You are all speaking too much for the man. You pointed at his UNN speech where he supported continued share of oil money, yet still proposed resource control in same speech and none of y'all is asking questions.
911 2018-01-04 22:43:09 Do u know any out of work oil workers?  Rhetorical.  How awful would it be if the kids in South Central had the opportunity to make good solid $$ working in the energy sector without a college degree??!!  Oh the horrors!!!
912 2018-01-04 22:43:03 They are made with Honey, Propolis & oil rich in #CBD - they’re very natural tasting and not too sweet
913 2018-01-04 22:43:01 Baby oil baths are literally the best thing
914 2018-01-04 22:42:45 Oil Tot is all set. Let the world send my Oil Tot the best equipment so he can play with his "equipment". :) I'm only talking about your new Microphone and game capture card. hehe!
915 2018-01-04 22:42:43 I use balms. Never used oil
916 2018-01-04 22:42:34 who is this man when you have sallow all the money in oil.who are you saying all this to the monkey in village or what.
917 2018-01-04 22:42:27 Renewable energy produces jobs too! Jobs that are not as dangerous that result in clean energy.
Coal is over.
Oil is over.
It’s stupid to continue to pursue fossil fuels.
918 2018-01-04 22:42:16 The bottom line is that the engine couldn’t properly pump the oil because it got cold out, but synthetic oil should be fine in -9 degree weather, and if the CR-V really can’t handle it than a salesperson from @MohawkHonda or @Honda should have told me
919 2018-01-04 22:42:15 Finally got avocado oil again. I was out for a couple weeks smh.
920 2018-01-04 22:42:09 Anyone who ever believed she would be held accountable was delusional.
Trump himself said they were" good people." 
Moment of truth.
921 2018-01-04 22:41:56 Iran government puts 450 million dollars of budget to the national tv for the upcoming Persian year. Iranians are twitting with #BanIRIB to say this is their tax and oil money and ask President Trump to sanction Islamic Republic of Iran's Broadcasting.
922 2018-01-04 22:41:54 One of Trump’s most harmful policies yet: allowing oil drilling off #Florida coast!  Wrong to put our economy, environment at risk. We must ALL band together to fight back! @SierraClub @EnvFL @FlaDefenders
923 2018-01-04 22:41:53 And not to mention all the kids CBD oil helps by treating seizures too. All those families who had to move to Colorado simply to get treatment would find themselves at a loss and in pain once again.
924 2018-01-04 22:41:48 Car wash + oil change + full tank = 
925 2018-01-04 22:41:45 This is how I define peace. Diplomacy is the best policy. Conservative Republicans want war. They want our fellow Americans to be blown up over something so senseless as oil or whose religion is right. To want war is unpatriotic.
926 2018-01-04 22:41:40 When you need your oil changed but you don’t have someone to do it for you for free 
927 2018-01-04 22:41:37 That's what the instructions said to do. I never used beard oil. I followed the instructions. STOP YELLING AT ME
928 2018-01-04 22:41:18 I used butter and coconut oil, i like so much. Butter more
929 2018-01-04 22:41:18 100% my zone the past few days too w more eucalyptus oil

932 2018-01-04 22:41:05 Girl, are you an oilcloth? Because you are fabric treated with clay, oil, and pigments to make it waterproof!
933 2018-01-04 22:41:01 So now Alaska gets destroyed for the oil barons. Increased pollution, destruction of habitats, all this rather than explore renewable energies. This leader an his administration are deadly because his "staff" is just an extension of his mental illness. There is
934 2018-01-04 22:40:57 Can’t wait to see all the beautiful oil rigs and fracking stations! #resist
935 2018-01-04 22:40:47 Seeking second term in US Senate, #Va Democrat @TimKaine slams @realDonaldTrump plan to open coastal waters to oil, gas drilling: 'Would threaten defense assets in Hampton Roads, and Virginians living near the coast tell me they don’t want it... It's not worth the risk.'
936 2018-01-04 22:40:40 I got my oil changed at the @jiffylube  in Halfmoon, NY. They sent me the service records and I can prove I’ve been maintaining my car—@Honda and @MohawkHonda is trying to blame the oil but I doubt Jiffy Lube gave me faulty oil
937 2018-01-04 22:40:37 PSA: if you use coconut oil for sex & ANY other uses in your home please use 2 separate containers & label. Think about why. Honestly how many people who don’t think about cross contamination
938 2018-01-04 22:40:30 Better speak up or these oil guys will run you over.
939 2018-01-04 22:40:28 What is the plan when we run out of oil?
940 2018-01-04 22:40:28 "Environmentalists said they expected several states to fight the plan and denounced it as a giveaway to the oil and gas industries"

942 2018-01-04 22:40:26 He has money in oil and pipelines. The ppl put a corporate giant in office and that’s all he cares about
943 2018-01-04 22:40:15 eso no es verdad solo si lo divides entre el 10 bs farsabte chavista
944 2018-01-04 22:40:13 Well said. This is so disgusting, and I cannot believe people would stoop this low! Oil Country is behind you guys, and will not tolerate this behavior!

946 2018-01-04 22:40:00 Asif ZARDARI ur in Effie t sugar mills r being given undue leverage at the cost of the cane growers . I feel u quit from sugar industry . Get into oil explosion , ship building or some automobile projects . Leave the farmers of Sindh alone . You may not see substance in this adv
947 2018-01-04 22:39:55 Don’t let them deny you cannabis. The oil healed me.  4 years in remission. Chemo and cannabis is good combo.
948 2018-01-04 22:39:50 In the end, it remains all about what's abundant in Iraq .. OIL. 

Billions of dollars worth of oil-deals done by Canadian and American entities in the last 15 or so years ...
949 2018-01-04 22:39:46 I was complaining cause I was about to be broke after paying for my oil change and this fool goes “get over it, at least you don’t have to pay $150” .... umm first of all mind ya own, aint nobody tell you to buy a bougee ass car
950 2018-01-04 22:39:45 @SBakerMD and I agree 100% on grass-fed beef: great if you can afford it, if not eat some fish from time to time.

Olive oil is not something I make a staple: lots of it is adulterated, and I don't care for the taste that much. Go California for non-adulterated.
951 2018-01-04 22:39:40 Removing oil filters by hand is so annoying 
952 2018-01-04 22:39:38 suck the oil off these titties
953 2018-01-04 22:39:37 I understand that the world's biggest problems come from oil products, but the world will escape this nightmare 
954 2018-01-04 22:39:36 Get it replaced. Twitter needs more "Oil Tot" like selfies! They are so cute I want to hug my laptop to hug the selfie! 
955 2018-01-04 22:39:33 If they think they are going to rape our beautiful beaches & coastlines with their ugly rigs and oil spills, they are in for a very rude awakening. 
956 2018-01-04 22:39:33 More oil spills, more dead fish, more dead sea mammals, more dead coastline, more disasters 
If it’s not sustainable, we shouldn’t be doing it.
957 2018-01-04 22:39:24 Oh yes. Kan väl sägas vara två fel, Vilka är COT-CLEAN Oil Technology? Har ingen aning nu och hade nog ingen aning för 10 år sedan

965 2018-01-04 22:38:42 I felt the same way until a friend with cancer was cured by Rick Simpson oil. As much as I might not like the smell, it can help people a lot medically. Not a fan of what sessions did today

967 2018-01-04 22:38:40 After deep conditioning my hair, using coconut cream AND using argon oil my hair still feels like the desert. I think it’s time for a haircut 
968 2018-01-04 22:38:40 What's the  price for the coconut oil?
969 2018-01-04 22:38:35 !) Zinke's reckless decision to roll back safety on offshore oil & gas to gift oil industry is criminal! To roll back offshore drilling safety regulations that were put in place after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico that killed 11 people and
970 2018-01-04 22:38:19 Sessions never wanted true help for patients on Oil. Sessions is bad for DOJ

972 2018-01-04 22:37:50 I first bought it at about 20p long time ago and then it went bust and we got monthly reports on creditors holding off but the refinancing was transformational. You just have to put the psychological stuff on one side. With oil price up shd do well
973 2018-01-04 22:37:50 Astonishing capital grab. Petrocorp drills exploratory well, puts minerals on balance sheet as asset. Decade later we need to allow depreciation of asset because oil (still in the ground) can’t be extracted, is worthless.
974 2018-01-04 22:37:47 Nancy grow up.  We need oil.
975 2018-01-04 22:37:39 IMO this statement highlights a serious issue... "journalists are compelled by their employers to express opinions". @withMEAA should be reminding its members to follow to the Code of Ethics. News and a journalist's opinions are like oil and water. They should not be mixed.

977 2018-01-04 22:37:34 I once grabbed sunflower oil. That was interesting. Hope you get some sleep soon buddy!
978 2018-01-04 22:37:30 This is nothing but a signal for oil/gas corporations to steal resources for corporate gain.  We’ve made significant gains toward renewable energy, let’s stay on the path to eliminate the burning of fossil fuels.
979 2018-01-04 22:37:25 I don't care how tuff you are that windchill is no joke. I changed the oil in my truck today took about 20 mins and I swear I think I have frostbite lol
980 2018-01-04 22:37:16 Nope, because the oil is in the gulf on the opposite side of the state. It’ll be interesting to see him put the military complex against the oil industry.
981 2018-01-04 22:37:08 you read anything about the idea of a Carbon Bubble? Expanding drilling, oil pipelines, it’s a confidence trick

983 2018-01-04 22:36:59 No I don't think he did! Doughty was very close to the puck it's a split second thing! I just think the oil need a shakeup and it's his last year of his deal! He is a cool dude but to slow and he does take some bad penalties! The refs have it out for him!
984 2018-01-04 22:36:56 He is trying to make a few oil company friends a lot of money
985 2018-01-04 22:36:54 Gotta wait a whole Hour for my oil change and I forgot my headphones smh
986 2018-01-04 22:36:52 knew if I hung around my parents house enough days in a row that my dad would wash it, gas it, and schedule an oil change for me. Unrelated: but also the French silk pie in the fridge would FINALLY be open too

no oil shows tn, I am using my cam towels to clean up and lay down where the leak is
997 2018-01-04 22:35:22 as long as the 1st oil platform sits off Mar-a-Largo, ok, just drill baby
998 2018-01-04 22:35:20 I never saw colby jack, perhaps I should have a look. I love Riesling and Chardonnay though, perhaps with nicely ripe coeur de boeuf tomatoes and Buffala mozarella, overlayed with a cold-pressed olive oil and a few drops of old viscous acetico balsamico and a pinch of salt ...
999 2018-01-04 22:35:12 Keep the #LastCentury thirst for oil drilling out of #California waters
1000 2018-01-04 22:35:06 Observation, not threat: Oil companies thinking these could be profitable areas to drill should consider that rigs are costly, technically complex, & very vulnerable to sabotage, and Californians are willful, motivated, resourceful, and will be pissed if they try.
1001 2018-01-04 22:35:03 That’s been obvious from the start. He is an oil well that his family will pump until it explodes. Elder abuse at this point.

1003 2018-01-04 22:34:44 "comes on the heels of a separate proposal to repeal offshore drilling safety regulations that were put in place after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster, as well as a decision by Congress to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling"
1004 2018-01-04 22:34:43 These particular ones however are covered in oil and suffering, so that was the point of using their photo
This year, I will not be cowed!
1005 2018-01-04 22:34:40 Hi Lee! We happy to let you know that we source palm oil from a number of suppliers, all of whom are members of the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO).
1006 2018-01-04 22:34:39 Lol I started using an oil serum to replace my moisturizer. Started it almost two weeks ago. So far, so good. No dryness!
1007 2018-01-04 22:34:29 FOUNDATION ADD A FEW DROPS OF FRYING OIL
1008 2018-01-04 22:34:29 My dad went ahead and changed my car's oil and filled my tank with $20 worth of gas, I love my dad so much!
1009 2018-01-04 22:34:23 Right. That would make sense. Just as it makes sense to allow time for transition to renewables by ensuring oil export pipelines get built and cost of replacing coal fired plants won't jack up power bills for consumers, as they're forecast to do in 2018.
1010 2018-01-04 22:34:17 I’VE BEEN DOING SELF MASSAGE FOR YEARS!!! JUST PUTTING/MASSAGING LOTION/OIL ON YOUR BODY AFTER SHOWER/BATH WILL MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD!!!
1011 2018-01-04 22:34:14 Hurricanes, Human life and Marine life do not mix good with oil rigs.  Fossile fuels need to go now.
1012 2018-01-04 22:34:05 So the current administration is going to drill more oil in the ocean, take away national park land, threaten nuclear war, and is going to start a new war on marijuana? #icantwiththisman
1013 2018-01-04 22:33:58 Trump is a one man wrecking ball!! How much is the oil industry stuffing into his pockets??
1014 2018-01-04 22:33:50 Fuckin with some grape seed oil
1015 2018-01-04 22:33:45 You think investors are going to want to risk large front end cash into new coal, oil and especially nuclear plants if, like you, they see solar as dominant in 5 to 10 years?
1016 2018-01-04 22:33:44 When solar and wind take over, who needs oil
1017 2018-01-04 22:33:26 One potential answer.  But why does the US oil industry also use it?
1018 2018-01-04 22:33:26 castor oil & get a bunch of those mascara brushes from ulta or sephora at those little try on areas
1019 2018-01-04 22:33:24 This plan is nothing more than a means to line the pockets of oil executives. It’s time to invest in wind, solar and hydroelectric expansion. We could lead the world in these clean technologies and create sustainable jobs for millions of Americans
1020 2018-01-04 22:33:23 That depends on your value system. If you believe oil and coal as currently used are a threat to our environment/climate those are worthy goals. If you believe that alternative energy sources are prohibitively expensive and result in significant inflation and lower GDP then no.
1021 2018-01-04 22:33:18 "Trump administration will allow new offshore oil and gas drilling in nearly all United States waters"
1022 2018-01-04 22:33:17 @realDonaldTrump fought an offshore wind farm near his golf course in Scotland because he thought it was 'ugly' but he wants to open 90% of US coastal waters to oil drilling. He is a natural disaster waiting to happen. #ImpeachTrump now. We can't afford to wait. Pence for @potus
1023 2018-01-04 22:33:17 Oh my!  Time will tell!  Funny mostly due to oil prices are high and tech stocks are also up!  Big tax breaks for large corporations while some are not hiring additional staff they are laying off!  What about middle America?  They are the ones who will suffer.

1028 2018-01-04 22:32:30 PS
incredible things ?
Making millions for himself  w supposed “tax cut”?
Reducing size of National Monuments So his buddies can drill  oil?
Removing environmental Regs
most unqualified Cabinet possible
Giving highly classified info to Russians 
violating emoluments clause
Putin
1029 2018-01-04 22:32:15 But it is TERRIBLE news for the environment and coastal communities. Also, didn't Trump just roll back regulations that were put in place to mitigate the chance of another BP-like disaster because they were too onerous on oil companies? WHEN will we learn?
1030 2018-01-04 22:32:11 Oregon and Washington? I know of one well that has produced oil in the entire Pacific NW.  12,000 barrels of geothermally-matured oil near Ocean City.  

There is no oil worth drilling for on the Oregon and Washington coasts. It's basically all down between Santa Barbara and LA.
1031 2018-01-04 22:32:11 So first he rolls back the additional safety regulation on oil platforms and then he wants to increase offshore drilling!  Yup...makes sense!

1034 2018-01-04 22:32:00 Anybody who can't catch the lingo on #DerryGirls will have to take their oil jist!
1035 2018-01-04 22:31:41 The United States is one of the largest oil producers in the world. I don't think we need to risk our coastline to give giant corporations another option to drill. Let's invest in green energy and create sustainable jobs.
1036 2018-01-04 22:31:39 So Lawrence, have you made space on your fireplace for the "fake news" award?  cooler for T steak - oil to go with the vinegary T wine?  hehehehehe
1037 2018-01-04 22:31:26 Florida will fight you @realDonaldTrump , I don't care how kissy-faced you are with Gov. Scott.  We need to protect our oceans, they're in trouble now.  Instead of oil wells how about ocean energy and windmills for power? Coral reefs are dying among other things.  NO MORE OIL!
1038 2018-01-04 22:31:25 and with Pruitt demolishing the Obama safety rules after Texas oil spill guess those jobs will be in clean up at taxpayer expense.

1040 2018-01-04 22:31:14 This new drilling and selling of these oil companies will make the country tons of money, but I have no doubt that this is going to harm our planet catastrophically.  Everything has an effect.

1044 2018-01-04 22:30:59 Actually he is trying to make us totally independent of Arab oil.  He wants us to be self sustaining with energy.  Maybe even export oil and,increase,the GDP and jobs.  Make sense?
1045 2018-01-04 22:30:50 I cook everything in olive oil and if I need salt always sea salt
1046 2018-01-04 22:30:42 Everything you just said is wrong. Scientists make the same amount of money regardless of what their research finds. And the only money is coming from gas and oil to discredit actual findings. And i love making money. And pls a source for the admitted manipulation.

1049 2018-01-04 22:30:20 There has been a huge increase in demand for heating oil and natural gas for many homeowners as temps remain in the single digits. Local heating oil companies are keeping a close eye on their fuel supply as thousands of calls a day come through for heating oil related visits.
1050 2018-01-04 22:30:17 I lived thru th Santa Barbara oil spill yrs ago. They screamed disaster-said it wld take years to recover from. It's very rare to have a spill, but that one cleared up in short order-The only trace of oil comes fr natural seeps. It's messy-lessens when drilling releases pressure
1051 2018-01-04 22:30:05 You know you're fucked when you can't smell Vicks or olbas oil when it's right under your nose
1052 2018-01-04 22:30:02 Second step: apply coconut oil
1053 2018-01-04 22:29:57 I get my oil changed at Meineke because they sponsored Steve Grissom 20+ years ago. Never underestimate the power of a Nascar sponsor.
1054 2018-01-04 22:29:57 Time to stop the rollbacks of environmental protections. Past oil diasters should stand as a warning to this administration. Mining in Bear's Ear, oil rigs off our coast,no.Time for Trump to be removed from office. His policies benefit the corporations that support him, not us.

1058 2018-01-04 22:29:32 Oil companies don't restore the coast they destroy. Reliance solely on oil will continue to affect the climate, causing stronger hurricanes more often. But what the hell do you care? The lobbyist are paying you well.

1060 2018-01-04 22:29:26 Oil company executives are voters too
1061 2018-01-04 22:29:23 Unnecessary regulations like not drilling for oil off recreational and environmentally sensitive beaches and then sticking the middle class and poor with the restoration bills?
1062 2018-01-04 22:29:22 I have been opportuned to listen to many interesting conversations on the controversial lingering fuel supply shortages. Let the Federal Government declare state of emergency on that sector, rebuild the moribund refineries. For how long shall we wait as major oil producer.
1063 2018-01-04 22:29:09 God bless you too I am a Christian woman ; this Jeff said he was a oil rig engineer and broke down the man told me so many lies many.

1070 2018-01-04 22:28:45 No one will be rushing to invest millions to drill with the price of oil sitting where it is and the uncertainty around Trump and the GOP's future. Business likes stability.

1077 2018-01-04 22:27:55 Heads up guys, I'll be playing Snake Oil with a bunch of creative streamers tonight!  Very excited.
1078 2018-01-04 22:27:51 I live on the Gulf Coast, 93 miles miles as the crow flies from where Deepwater Horizon oil spill was. 6 years- 11ppl died, the waters are sick beyond belief. Back off.
1079 2018-01-04 22:27:48 then explain why we still import oil if we have enough to export and considering Obama hated fracking and pipe lines, how are you giving that win to him?
1080 2018-01-04 22:27:47 You're out of your mind, Susang4Trump.  Out of your mind.
1081 2018-01-04 22:27:45 He has recently rolled back regulations put in place after BP oil spill! When he touts roolbacks, it's not good news.
1082 2018-01-04 22:27:43 You claim clinical trials are inefficient to prove the efficacy of the treatments we're discussing. My question to you is, how else could this be established? Unless you think any snake oil bullshit has to be considered a "treatment"
1083 2018-01-04 22:27:41 Its more like oil based nourishment.
1084 2018-01-04 22:27:39 Please send him photos of santa barbara after the last oil blowout.
1085 2018-01-04 22:27:37 @Karma_Rx going to get the oil out in a bit  want me to do some stuff over one of your pics Sexy ?
1086 2018-01-04 22:27:15 Also most oil spill r in transport not taking it out. Horizon was  human error
1087 2018-01-04 22:27:08 oh my god skin is so confusing wtf lizzy the oil guru thank u bby Xx
1088 2018-01-04 22:27:07 Food and Oil. Always.
1089 2018-01-04 22:27:00 No invasion necessary. The route of oil imports (60% of usage) is however vulnerable.
1090 2018-01-04 22:26:57 Or not. Nikoli Tesla is foundation of modern life as we know it. Nobody knowlegable would make blanket statement he was incompetent.
1091 2018-01-04 22:26:55 There is no need for expensive deep water drilling. Oil is only $60 a barrel, too cheap. This does nothing for LA.
1092 2018-01-04 22:26:53 President Trump wants to open up 90 percent of USA waters to drilling ? I think he misjudges how well many remember the massive oil spills of the 60s in California.
1093 2018-01-04 22:26:52 Just imagine a few of the Pres’s new Oil Rig’s out in that Hurricane!

1096 2018-01-04 22:26:41 She probably got her oil checked several dozen times
1097 2018-01-04 22:26:36 Got some negative history with #TRIN, from my bad ol' oil days but need to get over it 
1098 2018-01-04 22:26:33 U already have oil on your beaches. They r balls of muds and oil! Because if u don’t drill the oil overflows from under the ocean. But you’re a democrat I wouldn’t expect u to know that information!

1101 2018-01-04 22:25:43 i wish i could rub coconut oil on all my problems..
1102 2018-01-04 22:25:39 Ah good to know. But why not have hydro operating full-tilt the whole time on a day like this? Seems weird to be ramping that up near peak instead of oil plants.
1103 2018-01-04 22:25:30 This is going to sound silly, but buy a diffuser. And lavender oil. It’s “girly” smelling but I’ve had terrible insomnia since my nephew passed away and it’s the only healthy way to calm me and help me sleep!
1104 2018-01-04 22:25:28 Coat them lightly in olive oil and salt them. Flip halfway through. Serve with sour cream. You're welcome.
1105 2018-01-04 22:25:25 Stick it to Moonbeam Brown--drill of the coast of California. 'Cuz there's so much oil it's seeping out of the seabed and polluting the sea.  Oh, no drilling?  Are you OK with blobs of oil floating out of the ground?  Monster!

1107 2018-01-04 22:25:15 I also take MSM and biotin. I use castor oil and sulphur free hair products. It was breaking because I bleached it 
1108 2018-01-04 22:25:04 Hi the lowest speed mix dry stuff for minute then add water with drop of oil in, let it do its thing for 3mins then take out & feel dough then back in for 2-3min,Higher %of wholemeal flour longer it will needLet mixer rest few min before doing next, I do 2 at a time
1109 2018-01-04 22:25:03 Coconut oil is so under appreciated considering it actually does miracles to your hair
1110 2018-01-04 22:24:56 @realDonaldTrump your plan to destroy coastlines, while you further enrich oil and gas companies. Californians will fight, greedy bastard!
1111 2018-01-04 22:24:55 Also, everyone who complains about January — have you FORGOTTEN that it’s the month of the annual @goop detox?! I want coconut oil seeping out of every pore on my body! I’m ready to snort lines of turmeric and (organic) reishi!
1112 2018-01-04 22:24:34 Is there something wrong with (setting future goals for )weaning ourselves off of oil ...and coal for that matter.
1113 2018-01-04 22:24:24 Last year (ugh) gained weight. No quick fixes. Eat right. Good nights rest. Moderate exercise. Get rid of sugar, sweets, simple carbs,starchy foods. Eat veggies,lean meat,fish,healthy fats like olive oil,coconut oils, almonds. Those fats r brain food,kill appetite. Love God.
1114 2018-01-04 22:24:14 how you could have  voted for the TAX RIPOFF is beyond me...you already have a big GIVEAWAY from the Oil Industry wherein all Alaskans get a monthly check...why you voted to TAKE AWAY THIS is ludicrous
1115 2018-01-04 22:24:12 Hemp provides oil, paper, clothing, medicine and more. It is a natural gift from God used for thousands of years, and corporations are suffering as its production grows.
1116 2018-01-04 22:24:12 Double the fat/oil than you’d ever put in yourself. Those restaurant cookbooks always lie.
1117 2018-01-04 22:24:10 Good more cheap oil for me
1118 2018-01-04 22:24:10 @Walmart whats the usual time on oil changes?
1119 2018-01-04 22:24:05 they can't do anything if people put solar panels on their homes! that's how you change the world- no demand- no oil,coal etc. but people who are not vegan are still worst destroyers of all life on earth.
1120 2018-01-04 22:23:58 Last time I checked those of us living on the OREGON COAST and make our living from the ocean and the natural beauty of this place are still part of OREGON.  Thanks for caring about us.  We don't need nasty oil wells here.
1121 2018-01-04 22:23:55 When Sean Spicer lied for the president, he looked like a hostage giving his captor's demands to the police! When Sarah( The Huckster )Huckabee lies, she says it with the absolute conviction of a snake oil salesman in the old west. Very impressive indeed!
1122 2018-01-04 22:23:48 This administration is an Exxon billionaire's dream, with so many connected players they are writing their own ticket to destroy the planet for short-term gain. Meanwhile, the rest of the world knows Big Oil is going the way of the dinosaurs from which it came.
1123 2018-01-04 22:23:48 @WisDems Be careful Wisconsin. Paul Ryan will soon be supporting drilling for oil in the Great Lakes. The @GOP has no concern for the environment. Even the Pentagon opposes unregulated off shore drilling.

Shall I offer my firstborn for my transgression,
    the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?

To act justly and to love mercy
    and to walk humbly[a] with your (2/3)
1128 2018-01-04 22:22:48 BUT it will make the 1% and foreign oil interests very rich...so, we are to be sacrificial lambs to their desires
1129 2018-01-04 22:22:47 My fav is Accuweather clan taking over NOAA and the NWS. But there’s also oil/gas exec at EPA. And Verizon attorney at FCC. So many to choose from.
1130 2018-01-04 22:22:44 Throw in some free beard oil...
1131 2018-01-04 22:22:42 tryna think of what ima eat, they takin hella long for ths oil change 
1132 2018-01-04 22:22:36 Opening a bank acct, sucessfully completing paperwork makes you fit to craft banking policy? Your tweet is weak
1133 2018-01-04 22:22:34 I'll double your pay if you turn Nagzz into paste. I needed to do an oil change on my cruiser anyway. ;)
1134 2018-01-04 22:22:30 It will also help us get off Middle East oil. If it is done correctly we can keep our shores clean and become energy independent.
1135 2018-01-04 22:22:30 Eric....you realize that your daddy is destroying our oceans? Your own children may find a time when oil and gas in the oceans prohibits enjoying what they once were. Deregulating and increasing drilling is a potential disaster
1136 2018-01-04 22:22:30 All that oil money that u politicans were stealin..  u can use that 2 upgrade the rail system of the whole of nigeria...  smh
1137 2018-01-04 22:22:27 @realDonaldTrump IS WINNING, LOOK AT MARKET, TAXES, REGULATIONS, IMMIGRATION ALL FAZES ENERGY OIL & Gas Boom Housing welfare down jobs!
1138 2018-01-04 22:22:25 What about drilling oil of the coast Line and destroying the earth, you are an idiot! Please retire and do us a favor, because florid beginning to look blue! This blue wave in Florida is because the GOP and President response to  Puerto Rico
1139 2018-01-04 22:22:16 i always get scared when i hear the word oil tho cos im sometimes naturally oily but should i just get a grip n try it? xxx
1140 2018-01-04 22:21:59 u know its a warm day when all your coconut oil has melted
1141 2018-01-04 22:21:54 Imma open a black Sam's Club called Keisha's Club and all we will sell is inexpensive but humongous vats of coconut oil for all your hair, skin, cooking, cleaning, floor polishing, mouth washing, and mystic needs.
1142 2018-01-04 22:21:46 hmmm... I’m gonna make tonight a self care night. Deep condition my hair, face mask and a rub down in coconut oil 
1143 2018-01-04 22:21:35 My friends dog had a couple drops of that oil and stopped seizures for 2 yrs then of course dog died
1144 2018-01-04 22:21:29 Well, the Separatists got 1,617,000 in 2014, from an electorate of 4,283,000.   That's 38% tops.  Since then, the SNP have catastrophic oil revenues  PLUS a worsening record to occupy voters' minds.
1145 2018-01-04 22:21:27 I've got ezcema myself. If your looking for something natural, try coconut oil. Usually works wonders! Also look at maybe changing your diet too, certain diaries like eggs seems to be a contributing factor. Hope this helps! Some times it's trial and error when it comes to diet.
1146 2018-01-04 22:21:24 I’ve pulled oil an propane tankers and there’s no way an autonomous vehicle could figure out the the horrible road conditions and obstacles endured. Let alone manage its own breakdowns.

1155 2018-01-04 22:20:27 Got choo @Rodrollin
1156 2018-01-04 22:20:21 Wow people are actually saying shit about his family??? Ya I agree he should never wear oil colors again but to say shit like that is unacceptable!
1157 2018-01-04 22:20:18 Now trump wants his oil and gas billionaires to rape North American coastlines
1158 2018-01-04 22:20:14 I don’t dispute that, but look at oil prices..there is a glut already, not even including what is being sent from Canada.
1159 2018-01-04 22:20:09 The only thing that matters in college football is how much money oil barons or venture capitalists can throw at your program. I've become happier with lots of things once I just accepted that it's all about how much you spend.
1160 2018-01-04 22:20:07 Watch out Gulf Coast !  Your man about to drench you in oil again ! Making that coast line serene again !  Big Con Don ! A few jobs worth it ? Wait till it happens! – bij Andrew Jackson's Hermitage: Home of the People's President
1161 2018-01-04 22:20:03 Omg!! Perfect! Set up oil refineries there too with thick billows of black smoke billowing. Flame out bad gas, too. The stench dies mane it great for entertaining.
1162 2018-01-04 22:19:57 Oh, the fact that Deep Water Horizon self corrected is of no import?  The fact that more oil natural seeps into the ocean daily than seeped into the ocean from that event is apparently immaterial. Wow, just wow!
1163 2018-01-04 22:19:55 Right so I just electrocuted myself with one of the flat's radiators. No wonder we use our own oil rads...
1164 2018-01-04 22:19:53 I wonder what the nutritional value of snake oil actually is?
1165 2018-01-04 22:19:51 Yeah that’s cause the oil on em I think. And yeah you can use a washcloth tho
1166 2018-01-04 22:19:44 Whatever happened to the $30 oil change??? This one today will only cost $600
1167 2018-01-04 22:19:37 The Korean leftist camp is also, if you think about it, ruled by oil fields like a North Korean block. Kim Jong Un moves along the lines laid by Kim Il-sung, and the left moves along lines laid by Hahm Seok-hun since 1958 and Jang Joon-ha after 1972. The leftwing governments,
1168 2018-01-04 22:19:31 He says one thing to us and another to trump. Lot poor people vote, but the rich will get richer with the oil rigs.
1169 2018-01-04 22:19:13 みんなオイルが好きだよね⁇あん⁇嫌い⁇嫌いとか言うならオイル使われてる食品も製品も食べるなよ使うなよwwwwww? ガソリンもオイルだよ⁇www 車も乗るなよwww? 野菜だけ食ってろよwwww ベジタリアンテラワロスwwwwwww
1170 2018-01-04 22:19:02 LOL! Something like that... you know if corn oil comes from corn; where does baby oil come from... only these are more mechanical questions. If A+B=C and C=1.5*A what is B?
1171 2018-01-04 22:18:43 Farage is of French heritage, with a French girlfriend, a German ex-wife, 2 half German children, and a very rich American friend is Trump. He’s a snake oil salesman.
1172 2018-01-04 22:18:34 @DemolitionRanch if you rub your  Hummer down with baby oil it will make your Hummer look GOOD ( AFTER WASHING IT )
1173 2018-01-04 22:18:28 And I smell ignorance of the oil business and the environment.
1174 2018-01-04 22:18:26 I just want an oil change why is it taking so long 
1175 2018-01-04 22:18:24 Coal is dirty & has been in steep decline since the 1980s, Gas fracking causes earthquakes, poisoning of ground water, heavy metal poisoning of the environment etc. And we have over 5 decades of oil spills killing the fishing industry. DAPL, Alaska, BP’s Horizon. #CleanEnergy
1176 2018-01-04 22:18:20 I am much older than you and every investment in diversity has been a losing venture. Oil prices were down but the NDP and Liberal Pile on has further reduced investment in the province.   Any spin that says otherwise is lying but clearly you are a gullible follower of those lies
1177 2018-01-04 22:18:11 Lower taxes and cheaper gas to get back and forth to work with not to mention less dependency on foreign oil.
1178 2018-01-04 22:18:04  castor oil is your friend
1179 2018-01-04 22:18:04 He's delivering his oil promises to Putin as promised.
1180 2018-01-04 22:18:03 Constructing a bullet proof policy directive in this environment is virtually impossible. 
ANYTHING will be challenged in courts, just shop
1181 2018-01-04 22:17:57 "This motherfucka cant fuck w me she gettin mad she gettin oil-uh-ly...I'll fry chicken on ya face you oil-uh-ly" #BlackInkCrew @FlyyyTattedSky got me hollering 
1182 2018-01-04 22:17:54 Easy fix , stop selling our crude oil to other countries. Done
1183 2018-01-04 22:17:54 @Heather_Nueart Of course U are.There's oil drilling N Alaska.Only thing Ur good for
1184 2018-01-04 22:17:52 The last thing that Putin or the Ayatollah want to hear is that Trump is trying to keep oil prices low by expanding drilling opportunities
1185 2018-01-04 22:17:48 Actually it’s illegal in PA to prescribe it in plant form. They prefer you Vape oil! That’s what my Dr is going to do once the dispensaries open in a couple months. I have CbD oil also. It cost me $100! I however like it in plant form so I’m sure it will be an adjustment!
1186 2018-01-04 22:17:47 Well today alone, AP is trying to report news of opening up oil drilling & selling health insurance across state lines - both of which Dems oppose. Getting no coverage due to tweet and stupid book coverage. By 2020 most of Trump's agenda will be in place but "resist".
1187 2018-01-04 22:17:39 So let's recap: @MichaelWolffNYC's book excerpt hits and then today we get DoJ attack on pot legalization, DoI opening over 90% of US #ocean to oil drilling, and DoS cutoff of nearly all aid to #Pakistan. Meanwhile, Russia. #Distraction much, @realDonaldTrump?
1188 2018-01-04 22:17:38 Get that oil and take OPEC down.
1189 2018-01-04 22:17:33 well say goodbye to any tourism related to those shores..... I know I want to bask in the shade of oil rigs and platforms.  Oh and you can use any spilled oil for sunscreen if nec... these people are ruining our beautiful country
1190 2018-01-04 22:17:31 I have no association with any oil company.  I love America and technology.  I love freedom.  I love lower taxes and hiking.   I love my family. I love my state and country.  Socialism is a crime against humanity.
1191 2018-01-04 22:17:24 Kieran, c'mon back and chat more about oil prices, don't be so one commental !
1192 2018-01-04 22:17:23 This is not good news. Renewables are a far superior source of Energy as well as a better Economic engine. This is just #CorpoateWelfare for big oil and you liars know it
1193 2018-01-04 22:17:21 Wow everyone would like cheep oil# just not from my back yard???
1194 2018-01-04 22:17:06 Sure thing! Dressing: Shallots, Garlic, Lemon Juice, Dijon Mustard, ground Black Pepper, and Extra Virgin Olive Oil. 
1195 2018-01-04 22:16:51 I get full synthetic oil so it’s way more expensive.
1196 2018-01-04 22:16:51 Oil and gas companies in which he and his buddies have stock.
1197 2018-01-04 22:16:43 my country of reserve orders! Several seaports are left to rot and oil monies are wasted to building dry port! Which roads will
1198 2018-01-04 22:16:38 We got a new bath oil at lush called “Polyamorous”

1200 2018-01-04 22:16:33 It's called The Voice and Face of the Republic of Islamic Iran(in Persian),

1203 2018-01-04 22:16:16 Do you get tuna chunks not stored in cans/in oil? I'm slightly obsessed with tuna sandwiches but hate draining the oil out a can and can't deal with fish-shaped tuna  #tuna lol
1204 2018-01-04 22:16:16 No one has ever overdosed on marijuana! Alcohol is 100% more dangerous & addictive than marijuana! There's also been great scientific & medical advances with the user if CBD oil made from marijuana that is highly successful in treating patients with rare seizure disorders!
1205 2018-01-04 22:16:04 Many in the GOP have become so hateful they would be glad to see an oil spill off of LA or San Francisco or New Orleans, or Miami or New York City. The one goal they share is to make those liberals cry.

We have an oil glut. We don't need this.

 Congress needs to stop it.
1206 2018-01-04 22:16:01 All that matters is what 10-yr yields do. If it’s oil that makes them go up, or wages, or just the lack of QE. The only thing that changes demand for stocks will be rates that are too high.
1207 2018-01-04 22:15:52 They just tried to hustle me at the oil change. NAH fam
1208 2018-01-04 22:15:51 This type of literature, journalism or whatever you call it is written to sell to the uninformed under guise of informing them. Worth is $0

1211 2018-01-04 22:15:41 Today, the Interior Dept announced that 94% of the Outer Continental Shelf  WAS off limits to oil/gas drilling and the new policy is to allow such drilling in 90% of OCS acreage.
The world changed today.
Jobs. Energy independence.
And The Left is focussed on Mr. Bannon's book.
1212 2018-01-04 22:15:39 LOOOL v important question. Deep fried in oil and then loaded with salt, definitely not!! But they are amazing
1213 2018-01-04 22:15:38 I hate to be the wet blanket here, but if you had to choose between oil and potable water, you'd choose the water.  Can't drink oil.
1214 2018-01-04 22:15:35 And more oil spills... and all that comes with that. Gonna unfollow you.
1215 2018-01-04 22:15:22 This Wild Growth Oil & biotin has my hair growing fast asf. 
1216 2018-01-04 22:15:17 @simpleskin Hi! Your SPOTLESS SKIN QUICK FIX CLEANSING WIPES claim to be oil free but there are a few oils listed in the ingredients. Please can you explain? Thanks!
1217 2018-01-04 22:15:09 My beauty regime mostly keeps it under control. Beard shampoo and beard oil (from @MilkmanOz mostly). Never been afflicted with eyebrow-druff.
1218 2018-01-04 22:15:05 So big government is a problem now and free market is so needed? Oil industry is booming right now but renuable is increasing demand and may in the future win out on oil. It hasn't yet. Can you send me examples of government suppressing new energy
1219 2018-01-04 22:14:59 Gotcha!  #MAGA on Patriot!!
1220 2018-01-04 22:14:38 Sue. States do have input over Feds when it comes to such matters. If Alaska Governor agrees it’s not worth loss of environment than he can stop the Feds. Same with any state. Make it very costly and expensive where oil companies say not worth it
1221 2018-01-04 22:14:38 Lip oil??? I've never heard of such a thing! Most chapsticks don't do shit for my lips but make em more dry 
1222 2018-01-04 22:14:17 Clove oil on a tiny cotton ball VERY CAREFULLY placed in a broken tooth/cavity can kill pain almost instantaneously. But you do have to be careful because improperly placed it can burn the shit out of your mouth lining.
1223 2018-01-04 22:14:05 Just wonder! City big bucks oil men give Spurs £150 mil plus Aguero?
1224 2018-01-04 22:14:01 Oil price doesn’t lie. Inventories are falling here. OPEC holding up their supply cuts. Iran issues. Global demand for oil is picking up as economies kick into high gear. All positives for oil.
1225 2018-01-04 22:14:00 #CME LOWERS CRUDE #OIL MARGIN TO $1950/CONTRACT FROM $2100. #OOTT $CL_F
1226 2018-01-04 22:13:55 I say drill baby dril! Barrel of oil up to $60! To high! 
1227 2018-01-04 22:13:53 Harris lives in Cockeysville. I doubt that the oil will wash up on his front lawn.
1228 2018-01-04 22:13:52 Shout out to coconut oil in tea for being a bad ass sore throat relief
1229 2018-01-04 22:13:51 1.8 mil? See ya. Don't blame him but that's nonsensical money. No guarantee he's worth that much. AM has oil money from now until eternity. Let them piss away the cash. Venables doesnt even make that much ( close tho )
1230 2018-01-04 22:13:47 I hope if they get the dialog going they also share hemp facts. Our oceans would not be as polluted with plastic if we had invested in hemp instead of oil. They declared a war and eliminated an env. friendly competitor ie hemp. Plastic made of hemp is 100% biodegradable.
1231 2018-01-04 22:13:26  I won’t be surprised if we’re drinking oil instead of water years from now

1240 2018-01-04 22:12:44 It’s really absurd to see citizens of a country that produces oil sleeping in queues at filling station to get the product. NNPC top officials need to be probed. How long will Nigerians be calling on Government to do their due diligence. It’s a big shame
1241 2018-01-04 22:12:42 A sweeper is now needed due to the amount of fuel, oil and mud on the roadway. The sweeper is approximately 20 minutes away.

1242 2018-01-04 22:12:41 Glad to see you are getting ratio’d on this tweet. Guess what, Paul? We actually care about the environment, and don’t want to see oil companies make a buck at the expense of clean air and water.
1243 2018-01-04 22:12:40 The distance is worrisome
1244 2018-01-04 22:12:39 These people will whore out our planet until there's nothing left. They are unbelievably short sighted and irresponsible. OIL IS DEAD.  They need to get with the program, but they won't because they're in the pocket of the oil industry. It's disgusting.
1245 2018-01-04 22:12:38 I smell like oil, grease, and jet fuel and i love it
1246 2018-01-04 22:12:30 Today I found out coconut oil was causing my rosacea to flare up and I have never felt betrayal like this before
1247 2018-01-04 22:12:18 Fred Koch, father of the Koch brothers, made his fortune by helping Stalin and Hitler build oil refineries. What a patriotic family! #darkmoney
1248 2018-01-04 22:12:08 Can’t compete with Oil money
1249 2018-01-04 22:12:06 My hair growing like weeds with this oil, vitamins, & water
1250 2018-01-04 22:12:04 Umm actually most Diesel engines with low injection pressure can comfortably use thinned cooking oil
1251 2018-01-04 22:12:04 Between this and opening up 90% of our waters to oil drilling ... it's a great voter registration tool for Dems & a unity point for Governors.
1252 2018-01-04 22:11:55 No be all of us oh. Abeg, but if you know the ones wey get oil and gas firm and dem dey hire. Just holla. Im available
1253 2018-01-04 22:11:54 No shit. Add me
1254 2018-01-04 22:11:49 We don’t need more oil.  Stop these people.
1255 2018-01-04 22:11:47 I need to start taking more time, to take care of myself. The time many women take to oil & moisturize themselves, is really valuable. I need to adopt that same thought.
1256 2018-01-04 22:11:45 I don’t want to swim in oil spills. I like not seeing oil rigs off the coast. Can’t we have nice things on this country?
1257 2018-01-04 22:11:40 Let’s hope he pays attention or because his ego is involved he pushes oil companies to drill anyways. After all he reversed oil rig safety regulations that were put in place after all the deaths on one, that could have been prevented. Now again their lives mean nothing to Trump
1258 2018-01-04 22:11:40 It will cause ugly oil spills, pollution and increase global warming. It will  produce no measurable jobs only profit goes to already rich oil companies. "Citizen Jill" is an oil company shill.
1259 2018-01-04 22:11:36 I’ve been using aloe Vera for my lashes & it’s the fastest thing that has worked. I’ve tried castor oil & coconut oil for a long time, but aloe is better. I buy the real aloe. Posted on my snap:zuhraabdul
1260 2018-01-04 22:11:35 Because I promise not to stream the Oil game on my phone?
1261 2018-01-04 22:11:30 ill rather  get you Brent crude oil and not one barrel but a well.  Don't be under rating my money
1262 2018-01-04 22:11:25 Trump and Zinke are energy “neandrathals.” Ramp up coal, oil, and other fossil fuel production with no worries about clean power and the environment. Offshore drilling is costly and fracking is making the USA energy independent. Oh, but they MUST reverse Obama’s executive order.
1263 2018-01-04 22:11:25 @SpeakerRyan @NancyPelosi Thank you Rep Schiff, however, it is the entire GOP power trip gang w/their huge oil kickbacks! Party B4 Country!

1268 2018-01-04 22:11:03 It will definitely help the economy and the environment, I mean look at the bp gulf oil spill and Exxon Valdez. They were giving oil away to everyone, the fish, the birds. With all the benefits we can spend more time getting pregnant, beating women and parents. Like the Palins!!!
1269 2018-01-04 22:11:01 I've never been to CA, but what is a oil island? Is that like a oil drilling platform?  One nice thing about the SC beaches are they are mostly beautiful just lots of tourists
1270 2018-01-04 22:10:58 It’s all for show. Very little offshore drilling now anyway. Not cost effective @$60 oil
1271 2018-01-04 22:10:51 I love it when I get a Mobil 1 oil change my car loves it too!
1272 2018-01-04 22:10:37 Well, as far as I'm aware the oil belongs to the oil companies so they got the profits.  The UK Treasury benefited from the tax which they have used over the years to provide generous welfare payments.
1273 2018-01-04 22:10:33 Someone asked me if the oil rig in my Snapchat was a crack pipe lmfao 
1274 2018-01-04 22:10:31 エルザー　何怒ってんだよー？
1275 2018-01-04 22:10:22 Oil $ establish baseline fuel prices which are impacted by refinery issues resulting in short term price fluctuations.  That last hurricane in the Gulf hit refineries in Houston resulting in temporary price increases, once that issue was resolved prices were driven by oil supply.

1280 2018-01-04 22:09:59 I used to use coconut oil at night as like an overnight mask and it worked for me I would wash off in the morning. But I see people talking bout how bad it is all the time
1281 2018-01-04 22:09:47 Next time there is an oil disaster, we will do NOTHING to fix it. Great job Trump!!!
1282 2018-01-04 22:09:41 I have neurofibromatosis. I find that CBD oil help my pain better than painkillers at times. It also has was less side effects.

1291 2018-01-04 22:08:48 Probably Justin takes care of his skin but everybody has acne in her/his life. Don’t put pressure into him he was frustrated with all the oil he had on his face even with the products he used. This happens to me too .. some people hits puberty later it’s all hormonal
1292 2018-01-04 22:08:44 Not to mention more oil spills, pollution, destruction of environment. Something to be proud of Paulie?

1303 2018-01-04 22:07:59 I wonder if AL has oil stock?
1304 2018-01-04 22:07:58 Prob why he hasn’t had a press conference in forever, and had to appear on video today. He’s Reaganed. Staff and GOP are covering it up to suck up every last dime and drop of oil while they can. Total sham.
1305 2018-01-04 22:07:56 Recommend a little Clove oil on spot that hurts.
1306 2018-01-04 22:07:52 I'd love to eat the chicken skin, but taking it off and using spray oil works ok, bit of booze isn't bad anyway and it's only for flavour. The bottle of wine I'm drinking with it's much worse. Obviously EVERYTHING is better full fat, but they're still tasty when tweaked!
1307 2018-01-04 22:07:44 Oil that we'll use for what? The upcoming takeover of the electric car?
1308 2018-01-04 22:07:43 You don’t “need” oil. Virtually every use of oil can be converted.
1309 2018-01-04 22:07:42 The Worlds inventors need to start working on alternative ways for replacing oil and gas. Absolutely nothing to loose because we need these minds working on something that will help the earth and the people in it with it’s obvious benefits.
1310 2018-01-04 22:07:42 When the water is full of oil sludge, the air full of cancerous pollutants, and global warming swamps our coastal cities, will short-term profits seem worth it?
1311 2018-01-04 22:07:36 We need to move away from our dependence on oil to renewable energy sources!  Poison the ocean poison the earth  and we all suffer, die.  We saw what has happened previously plus Trump reversed safety on oil rigs just a few weeks ago. #NoOilDrillingInOceans
1312 2018-01-04 22:07:21 I understand the US interest in the oil producing countries because China. You’ve explained that pretty well. I don’t understand why Israel is such a big deal though. Why does the US give a shit about them?
1313 2018-01-04 22:07:20 That's what he meant when he said he was working during the holiday. Making deals for Trump businesses. Comes back to DC -  EO to allow pacific coast oil drilling
1314 2018-01-04 22:07:19 Hardly worth a mention. It's the type of thing that many people - even intellectuals - can trip over. I worry that by crying wolf every freaking time, that you're undermining the real issues. Like oil drilling everywhere. That's newsworthy.
1315 2018-01-04 22:07:15 FWIW, most of our imported oil comes from allies. The top five exporters to the US: Canada, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela, and Nigeria.

Also, last year we hit a 30-year low for our dependence on foreign oil. Crazy to go nuts drilling when we're already trending the right way.
1316 2018-01-04 22:07:15 CME CUTS MARGIN REQUIREMENT FOR NYMEX CRUDE OIL FUTURES
1317 2018-01-04 22:07:02 Interesting about the oil usage. Inevitably, BMW’s and other performance cars like a litre of oil every 1000 miles or so, my 330ci will use more on long, high speed motorway runs. As a matter of interest, what did you run prior to the M5? Always loved cars too
1318 2018-01-04 22:06:59 I still have oil from my vape pen just no vape
1319 2018-01-04 22:06:57 Are essential oils REALLY essential? Jesus said, “Only one thing is needful.”
Pretty sure He wasn’t talking the latest diet, oil, or fad. Just asking for a friend...
1320 2018-01-04 22:06:57 I don't mind a little oil mixed in with my cape cod beach water!!
1321 2018-01-04 22:06:55 Question - I'm making roasted peppers stuffed with soy chorizo, black beans, basmati rice, and greens. Should I serve them with tahini sauce, a pool of olive oil, or labneh?
1322 2018-01-04 22:06:47 Renewable energy is the future, and we believe we should be the leaders and innovators, not China. Oil is becoming obsolete. We want to lead. Jobs of the future, not the past. Why don't you want to live in this century? Why do you want to poison our water?
1323 2018-01-04 22:06:38 My house uses oil, but my generator runs on propane.
1324 2018-01-04 22:06:25 This is big folks, the petrochemical workers will bring Iran to its knees.  They can't kill that resource.  If they bring in Russian replacements the Iranian oil workers will kill them.

1327 2018-01-04 22:06:08 They just want that oil $$$$.
1328 2018-01-04 22:06:07 Greener is to convert to renewables now. Oil is finite and screwing climate will cost a bundle.

1331 2018-01-04 22:05:55 No, California will protect her coast from the pillage that is this administration. We will not have our coast under oil spills or a disaster like deep water horizon. We don’t want it! Go someplace else where they don’t care about the environment.
1332 2018-01-04 22:05:43 I’ve been using coconut oil for my face after I do my face washing regimen & my skin has been so soft and pretty clear since then.

1338 2018-01-04 22:05:20 Trump is about killing off everything beautiful and only "thinks" in terms of dollars and cents, and of course Big Oil, Russian and otherwise. He needs to go. The earth is at stake.  I cannot think of anyone less deserving of the gilded lifestyle he has gained for himself.

1340 2018-01-04 22:05:14 Legitimate? Only if you believe in the hereditary principle. In any case, I never said Mossadegh was a good guy. But it was not Britain nor the USA's (and no, not Russia's either) business to interfere. And they only did so anyway because of the oil.

1342 2018-01-04 22:05:04 According to the "my opinion is the only right one" people in my office, the only people buying condos are oil workers (which don't want to live downtown so stop building downtown condos) or bachelor billionaires (who don't exist so stop building downtown condos).
1343 2018-01-04 22:05:02 I think you can put this on your resume if you apply for a job in Alberta's oil sands.
1344 2018-01-04 22:04:54 Correct. I’m not sure I understand free market when the oil industry gets public money.
1345 2018-01-04 22:04:51 We are the only nation in the world that keeps of its offshore energy resources off-limits. When the oil market is doing well the entire country begins to benefit from jobs and enhance our national security. It’s past time to take advantage of this tremendous American opportunity

1347 2018-01-04 22:04:46 In dossier: named Russian offered Trump and Page 19% of Rosneff Oil. Just over 2bn shares given. Laundered through 50 companies (probably shells). Trump's cut is in the Caymans. Unclear who else got a cut but this is bad enough.
1348 2018-01-04 22:04:43 Today hearing about Trump admin's dangerous move to sharply expand offshore. Funny enough few days ago I received a job offer in oil & gas.  The devils are out there. #KeepItInTheGround
1349 2018-01-04 22:04:38 Mind-numbingly short-sighted.  Not only is drilling for oil a 20th-century technology that inevitably causes pollution, but the administration is willing to endanger these coastal states' tourism industries that are based on pristine beaches and clean oceans.  @RepTedYoho
1350 2018-01-04 22:04:37 The main problem is they have the Royals played by beautiful women and handsome men. The Windsor's are , by any measure , not oil paintings ( except when they get painted...) Heh heh
1351 2018-01-04 22:04:36 Thinking about all extraction (minerals, oil, gas) going on in our country, if we can do them ourselves from extraction to product, we are economically independent - a threat many investors/funders don't want. #PNGNowAndThan #PNG

1360 2018-01-04 22:03:23 I get that @realDonaldTrump is a sedentary slug who hasn't swam recreationally since the late 1950s, but surely someone in the @EPA will tell him why opening U.S. coastal waters to oil drilling is a terrible thing.

1371 2018-01-04 22:02:44 Ginger root capsules or tea. Peppermint tea or candies made with real peppermint oil. Hope you feel better soon!
1372 2018-01-04 22:02:43 Tea Tree Oil saved my life
1373 2018-01-04 22:02:42 This was baked and you can use olive oil or another veggie oil instead of butter. It turns out a nice mix of crispy and soft.
1374 2018-01-04 22:02:37 I will be grabbing mine for sure...
1375 2018-01-04 22:02:35 Hahahaha u nid to get sum anointing oil as well
1376 2018-01-04 22:02:31 this guy in front of me at the place I’m getting my oil changed was being such a dick for no reason like chill my dude 
1377 2018-01-04 22:02:18 In town driving seems to be worse for oil loss. I drove to CO this past summer without much loss. One quart the whole trip.
1378 2018-01-04 22:02:17 Wait til the oil starts washing up on the outer banks, myrtle beach, Charleston and see how red those states stay
1379 2018-01-04 22:02:09 This is horrific. Deep Water Horizon much? How about the Santa Barbara oil spills? You invest, literally, in a dinosaur technology. Rather than ostrich the situation, perhaps a little forward thinking? The petroleum economy is doomed. DOA!
1380 2018-01-04 22:02:06 Too many dollars in existence, government has too much debt [raising interest rates increases the debt], China is launching oil futures in Yuan on international market, China making big oil moves with Russia and Middle East.
1381 2018-01-04 22:02:06 And more oil spills on American beaches. More polluted fisheries. More polluted nesting grounds. Good job gentlemen. Be sure to wipe your mouths, when you’re done fellating those oil execs.
1382 2018-01-04 22:02:06 Speaking of car maintenance I need to do my oil change lol it’s past due 
1383 2018-01-04 22:02:01 I need a new serum and an oil cleanser (kinda)...also more books
1384 2018-01-04 22:01:52 The Trump Administration’s effort to open up coastal waters off WA & other states to oil drilling is outrageous, wrong & disrespects the many, many people who want their pristine coasts preserved.
1385 2018-01-04 22:01:49 Saleswoman: "When you bought your car here, did you purchase an oil package?" 
Me: "I did not buy my car here."
S: "Yes you did."
Me: "FUCKING FIGHT ME"
1386 2018-01-04 22:01:45 Don’t forget the Corexit used to break up the oil from the big BP oil spill. Carcinogen broke oil up and sank it to the bottom of the gulf. Nobody is talking about that.
1387 2018-01-04 22:01:36 Impossible to grow an economy when your number one goal is to keep oil prices high to prop up Vlad's regime.
1388 2018-01-04 22:01:36 Yes... i used coconut oil, leave in condition and water

1390 2018-01-04 22:01:14 Criminals over Oil Paint.
1391 2018-01-04 22:01:08 (Climate Control) Oil for Oceans Evaporation, Ice for Polar Caps, Salt Preservation Raising Temperature, Fertilizer for Sediments contribution to Oil Deposits
1392 2018-01-04 22:01:06 I can only imagine it happens A LOT! Bc instantly he called me. I swear he was gonna cry he was so upset. I’m just dying of laughter. He says “that damn oil better massage you itself for how much it costs.”
1393 2018-01-04 22:01:03 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats
1394 2018-01-04 22:01:03 Pouring beer on the Gulf oil spill was another classic.  He's loooong past his prime.
1395 2018-01-04 22:00:59 Catching a whiff of this aromatic herb may increase alertness and improve memory. To stay sharp, try smelling fresh rosemary or inhaling the scent of rosemary essential oil works too!
1396 2018-01-04 22:00:53 Yes I would agree with that. The Government of Alberta, in my opinion, has nothing to do with the global price of oil. The NDP don't now and the Tories didn't in the past. If we did we would prevent recessions haha
1397 2018-01-04 22:00:50 I know that. But trump just stopped regulations that would prevent another Deep Water Horizon disaster. Right now, there is plenty of oil, there is no need to drill offshore. Oil will run out someday, and we need to prepare for that.
1398 2018-01-04 22:00:50 Drill baby drill!! Think about the all the cheap oil
1399 2018-01-04 22:00:46 January 04, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1400 2018-01-04 22:00:45 In 112 hours, the Sun provides as much energy as is contained in all proven reserves of coal, oil, and natural gas. #SolarFacts
1401 2018-01-04 22:00:45 What are the biggest examples of government intervention in history?--slavery, colonialism, enclosure, war, genocide, imperialism, borders, police, prison, drug laws, nuclear weapons, coal & oil production, mass surveillance, contract, incorporation, joint stock companies & more!
1402 2018-01-04 22:00:42 went to get my oil changed and when I pulled out the garage I noticed the guy left his number written on a piece of paper in my truck...
1403 2018-01-04 22:00:33 in the 21st century
few but militaries need oil...
1404 2018-01-04 22:00:31 I think they changed the laws regarding clean up. I think they did away with oil companies being held accountable for the cleanup. Americans need to know who will be responsible for the damage when a spill happens. Hold them accountable today, before they do environmental damage.
1405 2018-01-04 22:00:31 （上から乗っても駄目です）
1406 2018-01-04 22:00:31 Atv and utv oil and filters change and valve adjustment $135 till March 1.  ($30 savings)
1407 2018-01-04 22:00:29 You’d rather pay the middle eastern companies for their oil? America first honey, get used to it.
1408 2018-01-04 22:00:25 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
1409 2018-01-04 22:00:23 I burn oil. Lots and lots of oil :)
1410 2018-01-04 22:00:23 AG reactions to Trump drilling plans:

@AGBecerra: "We are evaluating all of our options to protect our State’s pristine natural resources"

@BrianFrosh: "Oil drilling off the Atlantic coastline is foolish, reckless & unnecessary"

@AGSchneiderman: "Risks are not theoretical"
1411 2018-01-04 22:00:22 Relax, there is plenty of oil on shore. 

Aren't we the world's largest oil producer?
If not we soon will be!
1412 2018-01-04 22:00:21 Cbd oil and other things from marijuana, not just smoking it and getting high. They’re making it all illegal. CBD from HEMP is being outlawed in Indiana
1413 2018-01-04 22:00:17 One of the oil companies should put one of their drills off Mar-a-Lago.
1414 2018-01-04 22:00:08 Why discuss Trump opening oil drilling in almost all American waters or DACA or Rudy’s buddy being appointed top federal prosecutor replacing Preet Bharara in Manhattan the jurisdiction of Trump properties or Trumps demands on immigration etc, when you can help sell F&F.  #MSNBC
1415 2018-01-04 22:00:06 Group chat
1416 2018-01-04 22:00:02 I don't have any problem with them drilling of shore as long as the rigs are 10 miles off shore.  America need it's own source of oil from multiple locations.
1417 2018-01-04 21:59:59 The people will fight this and the corrupt administration will lose. Oil is done. When will these companies get that fact and move their money elsewhere?
1418 2018-01-04 21:59:57 Going to be a rough commute to DC without oil drilling. You going to take your solar powered plane? Or ride your bike. Maybe horse and buggy like the pioneers. And your trained seal followers all clap for your hypocrisy.
1419 2018-01-04 21:59:52 And ART has announced layoffs... Your father is going to auction off oil drilling in our waters. Do you care NOTHING about your children's future environment? Despicable! #25thAmendment
1420 2018-01-04 21:59:40 Who got tha oil 
1421 2018-01-04 21:59:27 Drilling? Who needs drilling? We’re swimming in oil in places like the Permian Basin.
1422 2018-01-04 21:59:26 Is @realDonaldTrump @POTUS the new dictator who doesn’t give a shit about anyone? Fuck nature, fuck world, fuck people, fuck economy. Only him him him and friends? @MinPres #oil #Greenpeace
1423 2018-01-04 21:59:22 After BP Oil Spill my small company lost a lot of income and it took almost three years to get Billings back up.
1424 2018-01-04 21:59:15 hey Climate Solutions Caucus guy @DarrellIssa, what do you say about California offshore oil drilling? because @MikeLevinCA and @ApplegateCA49 will stand up for #CA49.
1425 2018-01-04 21:59:14 In every headline today evidence of just how far this administration wants to drag us backwards.  Entrenched donor interests at every turn from oil and gas to private prison owners.  It's all wrong.  It will lead to our decline.
1426 2018-01-04 21:59:13 Dipsticks are only $13(15.60w/tax)! Get a 1/2g of top-shelf nug dunked in rosin oil then rolled in kief!!! What more could you need!
1427 2018-01-04 21:59:08 February 2011 Perfect example of how #Crude #Oil can pullback much while being in a full blown uptrend. Strong uptrend that rewards both longs and shorts in the right spots and different timeframes. @Bamabroker @AdamMancini4 @_JamisonG_
1428 2018-01-04 21:59:01 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
1429 2018-01-04 21:58:54 تسلم وألف مبرووووك
1430 2018-01-04 21:58:54 Cannabis Oil Kills Cancer Cells / Black Salve Extracts Cancer - Do your own research folks. All Cancer charities are SCAMS.
1431 2018-01-04 21:58:52 Possibly. It won't take a lot to sort it, but I need to sort it before it gets out of hand, I reckon. Yeah, you're right, other two jobs are minor. It also seems to have sorted itself out in terms of its tremendous oil usage as well, so I guess that was to do with it standing.
1432 2018-01-04 21:58:49 ‘a little bit of oil’ is the biggest lie any chef has ever said
1433 2018-01-04 21:58:44 1/34 President-Of-India-Holdings  Portfolio 'President-Of-India-Holdings' has been modified by Cent! Increased Oil & Natural Gas Corporation
1434 2018-01-04 21:58:44 Right. If you have tea tree oil at home, put it on the spot. Hope it helps
1435 2018-01-04 21:58:43 Trump wants to try and allow oil drilling off CA. @Govjerrybrown please raise the tax rate on oil companies so high they can't profitably drill here.
1436 2018-01-04 21:58:42 
1437 2018-01-04 21:58:18 im getting my oil changed @ Walmart and this girl who was sitting in the waiting room with me stomped on a stink bug and walked out so now the whole room smells.....

bitch
1438 2018-01-04 21:58:18 Someone come keep me warm while I wait for my oil change? I am not leaving my car running for an hour or better just sitting here. Also, bring dinner. Skipping lunch was a bad idea.
1439 2018-01-04 21:58:11 Modesto CA 12:10 today, found fire in honey oil lab & pot grow in a MFD on Gerita Ct
1440 2018-01-04 21:58:10 But you think Trump cares? Why not erect a huge oil rig next to MaraLargo see the orange out squeal #TrumpSucks
1441 2018-01-04 21:58:06 Trump just picked a fight of epic proportions to open nearly every coast to the risks of oil spill and spoiled coastlines. He won't win. #offshoredrilling
1442 2018-01-04 21:57:53 I got the oil in my car changed today, & they got all the snow off & washed it. It was so exciting. It’s amazing what excites me as an adult 
1443 2018-01-04 21:57:52 Because we need more high cost oil when we are at really low prices?  Do you even try to understand anything or did you just figure since trump don’t know sh1t you don’t have to
1444 2018-01-04 21:57:45 That's the reason  our currency remain the way it is. We boost economy of other nations with our actions and reactions . we engage in frivolous activities that demands for forex that weaken the naira the more  I can imagine a country blessed with crude oil importing fuel.
1445 2018-01-04 21:57:44 That's an interesting frame!  I definitely get riled up when people start talking about data as "the new oil." 
1446 2018-01-04 21:57:42 @TomShillueShow  CBD oil has no THC and it is legal in all 50 states. It solves all medical conditions with no side effects.
1447 2018-01-04 21:57:36 There are two types of CBD oil?  Didn't know that.  The articles I've read just say that it is illegal in Indiana, but don't specify what type.
1448 2018-01-04 21:57:30 I’ve been able to feel Ivie in my pelvis for like the last month and it’s uncomfortable every time she moves her head.  If you’re full term you should try Evening Primrose Oil! It can help soften and efface the cervix.
1449 2018-01-04 21:57:30 Today the reversed offshore drilling restrictions for the major oil companies.
1450 2018-01-04 21:57:27 Olive oil
1451 2018-01-04 21:57:17 Every choice our Admin is making does not make since. States here are fighting to make it better and on top of it oil rigs. Wow!!  So unhappy.
1452 2018-01-04 21:57:10 Yea let’s keep paying money, for oil, to people who hate us and want us dead. How about working WITH the administration to be safer and energy independent instead of just DEMagoguing everything trump. Pathetic. @realDonaldTrump @marthamaccallum @BretBaier
1453 2018-01-04 21:57:08 ugh I wanna change the oil in my car but it’s so freaking colddddd
1454 2018-01-04 21:57:04 Omg I’m dead, my dad just texted me “all of oil” instead of olive oil 
1455 2018-01-04 21:57:01 I saw this coming
1456 2018-01-04 21:57:01 Wasn’t the point of the new pipelines to send oil from Canada for refining?  We have just opened ANWAR for oil drilling but Saudi Arabia already owns the largest refinery in US...this really controls the pricing as there is no shortage of raw sources.
1457 2018-01-04 21:57:01 rosehip oil is amazing for winter skin
1458 2018-01-04 21:56:54 I need a hot oil treatment for my locs.... i was to lazy to and skipped a step on wash day and it’s so obvious 
1459 2018-01-04 21:56:53 Amen!!!  My back is tired. And I grow impatient with 5th generation welfare recipients-  these parents don't teach their children how to grow up and achieve - they teach them how to fill out welfare forms. I AM SICK OF IT - we could help so many people if we quit helping the lazy
1460 2018-01-04 21:56:49 Imagine if they had to.....check the oil!
1461 2018-01-04 21:56:31 My favorite thing for lashes is marula oil 
1462 2018-01-04 21:56:21 Yeah Jacob hooy CBD oil 20 pound couple of drops under your tounge when needed picked me up when I was anxious and depressed before I was diagnosed. now use for pain give it a go nowt to lose 
1463 2018-01-04 21:56:17 - motor oil?!??
1464 2018-01-04 21:56:16 Oil field money where ya at lmao
1465 2018-01-04 21:56:14 Sadly, I think they rolled back accountability first.  I think they did away with oil companies being responsible for the clean up if something does happen.  That clean up will be left up to us.  Shame, shame, shame!
1466 2018-01-04 21:55:58 Our government's oil development plans has nothing to do with benefitting Americans & has everything to do with manipulating international relationships and enriching oil/gas industry, #BigBanks and politicians on BOTH sides of the aisle & it's been that way for decades.
1467 2018-01-04 21:55:57 All those Floridians who voted for Trump should be happy to have oil on their beaches.
1468 2018-01-04 21:55:44 Words that don't appear on her climate change page:

Fracking,
Carbon Taxes,
Drilling,
Green Energy Subsidies,

Her energy and oil goals are for the most part already happening because of economies of scale. It's not a bold document.
1469 2018-01-04 21:55:29 السلام عليكم
ماهي مكونات الزيت؟ كم سعره؟خلال كم تظهر النتايج؟
1470 2018-01-04 21:55:25 
1471 2018-01-04 21:55:20 All you care about is money!  Sold out to gas and oil, which is not the future!
1472 2018-01-04 21:55:19 It’s good if you don’t want to fill in your brows everyday (it fills in the sparseness) and it lasts up to 3 weeks but if you like to use an oil based makeup cleanser/remover don’t tint them at all!
1473 2018-01-04 21:55:13 "We stand with the proud people of Iran because it is right, and because the regime in Tehran threatens the peace and security of the world."

Ha...Arh c'mon since fucking when?
Has Iran, got something you want, like oil?
Sure...yeah sure...whatever yourselves

Ha yeah
1474 2018-01-04 21:55:01 I believe anbesol has clove oil in it, as well as blessed, blessed lidocaine.
1475 2018-01-04 21:55:01 It’ll be okay, Fukushima is still pouring in the ocean. The fish with be mutants and need the oil to survive
1476 2018-01-04 21:54:53 The yuan is trading. The petro is failing. This always causes a war when anyone tries to create new currency. Venezuela China and Russia are buying oil with yuan (China) not Petro (US) even N Korea.
1477 2018-01-04 21:54:49 You voted for Trump Frank. You voted for oil exploration off NJ beaches.
1478 2018-01-04 21:54:49 My go-to fix is a heating pad or a hella hot bath + extra strength Midol + CBD oil/capsules!
1479 2018-01-04 21:54:45 Good, #Congressman, but remember uncontrolled political #PAC $$ cut both ways. If you’re willing to let the #NRA fund YOU, your colleagues in non-coastal oil producing states feel the same way abt feeding at the teat of #BigOil. Don’t let them sway you on this one - too critical.
1480 2018-01-04 21:54:39 Artichokes tu puta madre. Fish, tomato and olive oil in Andalusia 
1481 2018-01-04 21:54:33 Better than all the rest. Bigly. #bpal7wordstory 
I’m not sure I’d wear it, though, @bpal - maybe if it were a charity oil :D
1482 2018-01-04 21:54:20 They are truly the worst administration in modern history. They work for big oil and no one else.
1483 2018-01-04 21:54:15 My roommate came back yesterday. 

The genius that he is decided to throw out oil in a plastic bag that he left right at the door to remember to throw it out in the morning. 

Our entryway is full of fucking oil now. i almost broke my clavicle trying to get in.
1484 2018-01-04 21:54:14 We hope each of the challengers for the 48th are prepared to tell us their stand on the lifting of off shore oil drilling restrictions. Our Coast is precious to those who live here.#ProtectOurCoast #offshoredrilling
1485 2018-01-04 21:54:09 do you think it really works? i always wondered if its like modern day snake oil or something lol
1486 2018-01-04 21:54:01 Kano now
1487 2018-01-04 21:53:53 What might be lost is that this piece of work is a Kings fan. Still inexcusable. The few Oil "fans" who did mean tweet Rig or his fiance can go fly a kite.
1488 2018-01-04 21:53:45 Stupid, talking to a lib in the first place.
1489 2018-01-04 21:53:43 Worldwide, not in a concentrated area. That's why the BP spill was such a huge deal. That much oil in a small (respectively) area of ocean is catastrophic to an ecosystem.
1490 2018-01-04 21:53:36 Where you at?
1491 2018-01-04 21:53:32 Sounds like someone’s IT Cell burning midnight oil
1492 2018-01-04 21:53:32 Hey Nancy. It isn’t published and official until Friday. How do you know what’s in it? I’m sure you haven’t read it yet. Yet you will be the first to whine about hearing oil prices or prices at the pump. No such think as renewable energy trucks and cars.
1493 2018-01-04 21:53:28 gonna have to sue to unwind everything becuz of illegitimate presidency and F--U if you are gas/oil company who participated in the grifting! okay, that's just my wet dream.....
1494 2018-01-04 21:53:26 I was interested in cars in my 20s - Learnt to check the oil , check the tyre pressure , asked someone to show me how to change the tyre ... as well - took it for the MOT ... !!!  
1495 2018-01-04 21:53:22 lol at those who think Trump's order to rescind Bear's Ears monument status is a victory for the common man.

That land isn't going to go to rancher families, its going to be carved up for big oil and gas instead.
1496 2018-01-04 21:53:13 He must not own stocks in the Oil company vying for this tRump gift. We all know he will be given some sort of payoff to agree wholeheartedly.
1497 2018-01-04 21:52:56 One of the benefits of that renter life.

I'll send over a nice, warm can of oil to soothe your aching adamantium.
1498 2018-01-04 21:52:56 In a weird way im less worried about that.  It’s like the promising coal jobs bullshit.  The market is moving on.  Oil is being supplanted by clean energy.  They can gnash their teeth all they like, but fossil fuels are too expensive to make compared to renewables.
1499 2018-01-04 21:52:53 Pass some laws dude. That’s the only thing that will constrain the big oil corporate give aways...
1500 2018-01-04 21:52:44 What a sad day! @isonewengland and @NewYorkISO are running a lot of #Oil @GovMalloyOffice @NYGovCuomo @GovRaimondo @MassGovernor we need more #RenewableEnergy #WindWorks
1501 2018-01-04 21:52:44 We're gonna need a lot of oil and energy for the manufacturing boom that's gonna happen thanks to @realDonaldTrump !
1502 2018-01-04 21:52:33 Just got back from natural foods vendor.  Coconut milk, powdered coconut milk, walnuts, cashews, pumpkin seends, sunflower seeds, chia, dried wild blueberries, coconut oil, EVOO, kelp noodles, spices, herbs, Redmond real sea salt, nutritional yeast, nibs, cocoa, Lakato #organic
1503 2018-01-04 21:52:19 Please tell me what the impact of sustained US economic sanctions have had on oil rich countries like Iran and Venezuela? If freedom = prosperity then how come Saudi Arabia is not reeling like the other 2?? The difference ->US ECONOMIC SANCTIONS. You know nothing kid.
1504 2018-01-04 21:52:17 The world is heating because of Global Warming! Funny,I don't see not one of the GW preachers living green,Solar Power,RainWaterContainment,veggie Oil Run Cars,Liars/Hypocrites
1505 2018-01-04 21:52:13 Yes, in an attempt to appease the oil pooh-bears & the Gulf states (US, not ME) Obama implemented sub-standard new rules for deep water drilling. He also opened up a number of states to offshore drilling. Sen Cardin couldn't stop Obama. He certainly isn't going to stop Trump.
1506 2018-01-04 21:52:12 Add some regulations so that companies don't dump oil on our water and we are good
1507 2018-01-04 21:52:10 Get some Oil of Oregano  & a dropper. Mix some drops with Saline Mist. Squirt up your nose 
1508 2018-01-04 21:52:08 Definitely gonna do a face mask, deep condition my hair, turn on the oil diffuser, and straighten up my room. Gotta get my mind right for my pre-bed yoga.
1509 2018-01-04 21:52:06 Una pregunta, aún se usa con profusión el Heating Oil o es un commodity en miras de ser retirado por el gas natural?
1510 2018-01-04 21:52:04 Wow. I’m taking back the oil I gifted you.
1511 2018-01-04 21:52:04 Let’s make a bet. I’m betting this “global warming” thing will die before the “dying” oil/gas industry. You in?
1512 2018-01-04 21:51:59 Have ever tried beard shampoo and oil?
Got some for Christmas. #beardlife
1513 2018-01-04 21:51:50 Think, what's important to Putin, OIL, does it make sense now?  Get rid of this asshole in office.
1514 2018-01-04 21:51:38 imagine what I could do with oil paint.. boiii
1515 2018-01-04 21:51:33 Like today I had to get an oil change that turned into axel seals needing to be replaced... whatever tf that means lol
1516 2018-01-04 21:51:33 Oh please you are trying to steal their oil and you want a regime change to do it.
1517 2018-01-04 21:51:31 Or...we (and plants and animals) need a clean planet to live on. It's the only one we've got. And the US already produces 40% of its own oil. There's no good reason not to embrace solar, wind, hydro, and other sustainable sources of energy.
1518 2018-01-04 21:51:29 I can't breath....can someone give me the Heineken
1519 2018-01-04 21:51:17 Ready to discuss drilling related engineering and operation services with operator companies which are looking for drilling support during this time when the oil and gas exploration and development are improving after the new oil price trend.
 Experienced in many drilling aspects
1520 2018-01-04 21:51:14 All my tires are flat and my oil is sludge. Guess who's at the garage for emergency repairs instead of getting scripts.
1521 2018-01-04 21:51:11 Get the red tinted glasses off. Win trophies regularly these players wouldn’t need to leave. We’re getting there though. We all would love oil rich owners with bottomless pockets but we don’t.
1522 2018-01-04 21:51:11 Stephanie, there is nothing reliable or trustworthy that comes out of Scaramucci ‘s mouth- he is a snake oil salesmen. He talked over you and through you- inserts different meanings , twists words, dismisses anyone else who is talking- yuk!
1523 2018-01-04 21:51:07 This is a terrible decision with catastrophic consequences, all so you can please your Oil & Gas overlords. You are disgraceful.
1524 2018-01-04 21:51:00 Dinner that I cook Parmsean chicken, broccoli roasted potatoes.
Hot oil massage I do myself and all that goes from there.
1525 2018-01-04 21:50:59 @realDonaldTrump You really are an ass. Opening up all coastal waters for off-shore drilling? Why? Let's just take the economics of it, oil prices are down and are expected to remain so due to supply/demand issues, ergo, Numb Nutz, there is no economic reason for this.
1526 2018-01-04 21:50:55 Muslims are confused? No wonder non Muslims are questioning the true nature of it.
1527 2018-01-04 21:50:54 The gulf has been ruined cause of the oil rigs
1528 2018-01-04 21:50:52 I wonder how many in his base have beachfront homes that will now have an outstanding view of an off shore oil rig? I wonder if this will be allowed off the east coast of Florida, near Mar a Lago?
1529 2018-01-04 21:50:48 Call me crazy but IMHO something else is going on. I am not a conspiracy theorist but... too much at one time...BOOK, MARIJUANA, OIL DRILLING all in a day or so!! What are we being DISTRACTED FROM??? I am not feeling good about this!! Hope I am wrong!
1530 2018-01-04 21:50:34 Oil doesn't circulate to the top end for three minutes, more for cold starts. Revving a cold engine reduces life of heads/valves
1531 2018-01-04 21:50:32 Cooking oil! She recommended vegetable oil.  Never tried it myself tho
1532 2018-01-04 21:50:27 U.S.A., madre and still making wars  around all world only to get  oil, gold, petroleum, water
1533 2018-01-04 21:50:21 Idk how much massage oil normally costs but $50 sounds a little pricey to me for just an ordinary bottle of oil.
1534 2018-01-04 21:50:08 Nothing like some good fillets dipped in Drakes Mix & fried in peanut oil
1535 2018-01-04 21:50:06 Muslims in Ireland is like oil in water.    They just don't go together. All this P. C. BS is going to get somebody killed.  Oh, wait...
1536 2018-01-04 21:50:03 Great decision! stops dependency on foreign oil.  But Trump did it, so of course you hate it.
1537 2018-01-04 21:50:02  frying them in oil!
1538 2018-01-04 21:49:57 You definitely haven't. It's historically bad. Worst in a whole season is 69 and change. Oil need to go 85% here on out just to catch that
1539 2018-01-04 21:49:56 I just googled 'trolls for hire' :) It is on a site called for fiverr..you can hire folks for 5 bucks to do anything you want.
1540 2018-01-04 21:49:43 Nicely said Callum 
1541 2018-01-04 21:49:34 Brent was pissed today because he went to the store to get massage oil and the lady talked him into buying a $50 bottle but he didn’t know it was that much.
1542 2018-01-04 21:49:25 What's with the OIL and gasoline at the pumps so high when we have anwr, Dakota pipeline and the keystone all supposed to ease up our gasoline concerns ?  @POTUS44 @POTUS @SenateMajLdr @HouseGOP  what's the deal ?????
1543 2018-01-04 21:49:18 ME TOO!!

I refuse to take opiates and CBD oil as well as edibles let me move every day.
1544 2018-01-04 21:49:16 Thank the Lord for coconut oil
1545 2018-01-04 21:49:15 That anointed oil I got from IEEE was in my car, now it’s frozen and I can use it as Chapstick.
1546 2018-01-04 21:49:13 Remember  the oil soaked seabirds, the fouled beaches, job losses, overall oceanic pollution. Remember
1547 2018-01-04 21:49:06 Rich oil patrons will make a Texas politician say anything to stay in power.
1548 2018-01-04 21:49:01 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
1549 2018-01-04 21:48:42 Fffff

Some very helpful person stopped us at the doctor to tell us all our tires are dangerously low so guess who is at a car servicer.

On top of however much the tires end up being, I have to flush my oil because we put it off so long. :///
1550 2018-01-04 21:48:39 Hahahahaha
1551 2018-01-04 21:48:22 With @realDonaldTrump rolling back off shore oil drilling, I expect a giant oil rig to be parked right outside of Mar-a-lago and any spills or clean up the rig causes that the ‘winter white house’ cleans it up #winterwhitehouse #maralago #offshoredrilling #oil #
1552 2018-01-04 21:48:19 I hope they set an oil rig up off the beach at Mar-a-lago.
1553 2018-01-04 21:48:11 Not exercising his first amendment rights is disrespectful to those who fought for it, just as you telling him what he should or shouldn't do is. But hey, it's your right to be a moron. THAT'S WHAT THEY FOUGHT FOR. Oh, and also oil and Cheney's no bid contracts that make him rich
1554 2018-01-04 21:48:11 Go away Al, nobody is buying your snake oil
1555 2018-01-04 21:48:02 If I am not mistaken the same could be said of that idiot Sadam. Billions of  dollars spent and made bombing Baghdad without getting their feet wet! Lol how much did that company make putting out oil well  big $ in war
1556 2018-01-04 21:47:55 We can't expect the "poor" energy industry to be BURDENED by requirements that it should do everything possible to prevent oil spills and other events that pollute our atmosphere! After all, who needs clean water, land and air anyway? WE ALL DO!!
1557 2018-01-04 21:47:50 Wow! Where did you find this?
1558 2018-01-04 21:47:47 This makes no sense Jim. Just a gift to his oil buddies. We're already swimming in oil thanks to fracking.
1559 2018-01-04 21:47:46 I love Brussels sprouts. Salt, pepper, maybe a little onion and garlic powder, tossed in a little olive oil and roasted until the outside is crispy and the inside is soft. Maybe a drizzle of reduced balsamic vinegar at the end. Better than french fries.
1560 2018-01-04 21:47:44 When you go to get your oil change they always come up with something extra that needs to be done 
1561 2018-01-04 21:47:44 CBD oil has been a great help too anxiety, depression, and pain 
1562 2018-01-04 21:47:22 Found a cute little white pumpkin oil diffuser on sale for only $9!
1563 2018-01-04 21:47:15 I hope all of the oil companies invest big in drilling in these areas, so that when we reclaim our government and reverse this decision, they all lose millions of dollars. Many will be paying a steep price for Trump.
1564 2018-01-04 21:47:15 @EarlSToyota what is the point of scheduling a routine oil change if it still takes 3hrs?
1565 2018-01-04 21:46:58 I was just thinking to myself that I need to order more Gun Oil..then I remembered my vagina is about to fuse with my ass when I push this baby out and an angel lost its wings and need for lube.
1566 2018-01-04 21:46:57 Currently watching youtube videos on how to check my oil levels. I need a husband for this... ASAP
1567 2018-01-04 21:46:56 Also rolling back protections after the BP oil spill disaster so what could go wrong? 
1568 2018-01-04 21:46:55 My brother in law has brain cancer and the CBD oil he takes has eliminated the tumors and keeps new ones from growing
1569 2018-01-04 21:46:53 What's a guy gotta do to be Marshal Of The Supreme Court and how much is his daily weed allowance?
1570 2018-01-04 21:46:40 We don’t need transportation infrastructure. We can transport that damn fine Alberta oil by canoe. Just like back in the day when Canada was a beaver pelt super power.
1571 2018-01-04 21:46:38 Because oil is the future? We have energy independence with the regulations, there is virtually no reason to support more drilling.
1572 2018-01-04 21:46:34 In California, coastal protection is a bipartisan issue. For many it transcends politics and is an article of faith. Raising the prospect of renewed oil drilling just threw a load of bricks on GOP candidates already laboring under the weight of the party's poor reputation.
1573 2018-01-04 21:46:29 Coconut oil saves lives
1574 2018-01-04 21:46:15 All US stores will carry Alpha Brain, Alpha Brain Instant, MCT Oil, and New Mood. They are also having a 25% off Supplement Sale, January 5th - 7th. #GetOnnit
1575 2018-01-04 21:46:15 music played a big role in my 2017 through continued growth, healing, and change. the top 5 songs that represent this past year for me  (in no order):

Blood & Tears - Joseph
Kai's Song - Overcoats
Monsoon - Amber Mark
Coconut Oil - Lizzo 
Keep The Wolves Away - Uncle Lucius
1576 2018-01-04 21:46:13 He's also de-regulating oil and gas drilling. Great idea. What could possibly go wrong? I mean corporations always act in the best interest of the public
1577 2018-01-04 21:46:12 Going Top tonight because of the triple captain.
While you are down there scouting for oil  #FPLxg #FPL
1578 2018-01-04 21:46:07 He is fighting for freedom,free speech, free oil, free death , and free air .... Land of  and 
1579 2018-01-04 21:46:04 If im going to gunk up the pipes (and i will), it might as well be with coconut oil, whuch if i may add, is a Healthy fat and Naturally Antimicrobial and an all around Safe alternative to red meat
1580 2018-01-04 21:45:57 Does President Trump think we are just going to sit back and let him drill for oil around the entire Continental US Coastline if he does he is stupider than we give him credit for
1581 2018-01-04 21:45:56 Oil and gas lobby owns the president.  I suspect its because the preaident relies on lobbies to run the government
1582 2018-01-04 21:45:55 Sorry.. delighted to have Maroon on our team. Good player, good teammate, good person. Some Oil fans are assh....
1583 2018-01-04 21:45:54 You @SpeakerRyan have obviously never spent time on a beach covered in crude oil. Such a moron of epic proportions.
1584 2018-01-04 21:45:40 you got it out the mud i got it out the oil.
1585 2018-01-04 21:45:22 No. Not while Republicans hold the majority in House and Senate. They must satisfy their donors and big oil.
1586 2018-01-04 21:45:20 Now I have to spend money to get an oil leak fixed on my silver car. These unexpected costs are making me so poor.
1587 2018-01-04 21:45:15 Someone didn't get the memo that most of it is just a fad, which makes it only slightly less bad than your Essential Sex Chakra Treating Oil Book Bundle in September.
1588 2018-01-04 21:45:12 Made available to the oil companies to make profit at the expensive despoiling the natural ecosystems of life, not to the disposition of all Americans.
1589 2018-01-04 21:44:59 J.Paul Getty. "Not everyone finds oil."
1590 2018-01-04 21:44:58 I've read reports there's a huge oil deposit right off Mar-a-Lago's beachfront.  Start there @realDonaldTrump
1591 2018-01-04 21:44:55 I agree oil was mismanaged. It paid for the enlarged welfare state, but how was it mis-managed for the benefit of London?
1592 2018-01-04 21:44:52 my 2018 aesthetic is that weird oil on a sardine that makes it look strange and confusing
1593 2018-01-04 21:44:51 It looks like an oil painting. Beautiful.
1594 2018-01-04 21:44:50 I've know lots of people from Alabama who smoke pot.  This is ridiculous.  I always thought it was the tourist industry who were most against off-shore drilling.  If I want to see off-shore oil platforms while on a beach, I'll vacation in Texas, not Florida!
1595 2018-01-04 21:44:48 How can anyone support opening the #ANWR to oil drilling? It appears you have severely misunderstood the definition of 'refuge'. 
If any of you had any sort of education in anything, then you would realize that this is a VERY bad thing for our entire planet.#Conservation #Climate
1596 2018-01-04 21:44:46 Goodness. I was yelling because the line at the oil change place was ridiculous. I guess that needed context. 
1597 2018-01-04 21:44:44 Thx to @VernBuchanan and @RepHastingsFL for leading letter conveying our opposition to any attempts that weaken oil drilling safety rules that protect against oil spills which would destroy our FL environment and costal economies.
1598 2018-01-04 21:44:42 Has anyone noticed that in spite of Trump's push to Drill, baby, drill, the price of gas continues to go up?  Your tax cut is being siphoned right into Big Oil pockets.  #MAGA
1599 2018-01-04 21:44:25 Something you won't profit from. In fact, this simply allows oil companies to enrich themselves, it will do nothing for what we pay for fuel as consumers, and will only increase the pollution of coastal waters were fishing is prime and hasten ecological catastrophe.
1600 2018-01-04 21:44:25 Consider some plug in oil heaters - what a nightmare
1601 2018-01-04 21:44:25 No, this is bad news for anyone not making money off big oil & gas.

You need to retire, you have done nothing for this country that didn’t put money in your own pocket.
1602 2018-01-04 21:44:13 You are blaming socialism for Venezuela? They are in dire straight because of global capitalism, not socialism. Market fluctuation on oil prices led to their decline. Market fluctuation are a feature inherent to capitalism.
1603 2018-01-04 21:44:13 Cursing oil indeed.
1604 2018-01-04 21:44:12 I forgot that this place is a fuckin rip off and just paid like double what I should have for an oil change W H Y 
1605 2018-01-04 21:44:10 Your forgetting the oil embargo plus the fact Carter produced 12 million jobs in 4 years.  That 3 million short of Reagan. Since you want to give presidents all the glory for creating jobs , which they dont, I'll give it to Carter. Not to mention an ethical human being.
1606 2018-01-04 21:44:08 Cabot Oil & Gas Corp hikes dividend by 20 percent to $0.24 quarterly. Dividend #yield for $COG is 0.8%.

1608 2018-01-04 21:44:00 It would snow two days before my oil and tire change appointment 
1609 2018-01-04 21:43:59 @realDonaldTrump by the way, Floridians, even most of our reps don't want drilling off our coasts. A danger to sea life, pollutant, will ensure more and bigger hurricanes. And we've voted no. So stick the oil rigs up your tight ass & stop deregulating, MORON!
1610 2018-01-04 21:43:58 I do! It's your chocolate olive oil cake! Now I have to make this as well?!?
1611 2018-01-04 21:43:57 Frank can no longer operate offshore enterprises and that includes "oil drilling" without consent forms for bore hole analysis.
1612 2018-01-04 21:43:52 I won’t make it this year. Could you possibly send me one?
1613 2018-01-04 21:43:38 A bit miffed I am! Nine and a half hours for an oil change wiper blades replaced and two light bulbs replaced way to go Rivertown Toyota
1614 2018-01-04 21:43:26 It’s as if nobody has learned anything from oil spills.
1615 2018-01-04 21:43:14 Renewables will survive and thrive with the right energy policies. Don’t pretend big oil hasn’t been a government pet project for years and years.
1616 2018-01-04 21:43:11 Expect the bottom to fall out of world oil prices.  Happens every time US moves towards energy independence.
1617 2018-01-04 21:42:59 Update: I washed the oil out of my hair this morning but my hair is still super oily. I’m going crazy
1618 2018-01-04 21:42:53 I would kill for someone me CBD oil rn. This migraine is fucking me up. My hands are freezing and I cannot stop spasming
1619 2018-01-04 21:42:40 From the guy who sued over electric windmills off his golf course in Scotland b/c they were ugly. I don’t want to stare at oil rigs off my beach which actually impose threats to the water and sea life. #NothingSacred
1620 2018-01-04 21:42:37 @minimalistbaker what’s the secret to perfect kale chips? either I put too much oil on them or too much salt or I simply burn them to a crisp 
1621 2018-01-04 21:42:33 Just sitting here trying to watch my show while I wait on my oil change and  this dude keep talking to me like I know you see my headphones are in
1622 2018-01-04 21:42:31 I’d also point out that cotton seed(byproduct of cotton) gets used for many things including cooking oil and a great food for my cows.
1623 2018-01-04 21:42:30 HahahahahaI'm on the ground....again
1624 2018-01-04 21:42:28 Oh please. I would not be too surprised if the Democratic party participated in fraud too. But you’re acting like you’re an innocent person. You’re so far from innocent. Mueller’s closing in, no tax disclosure, an atrocious tax plan, anti-conservational oil drilling laws.
1625 2018-01-04 21:42:26 We are, we finally got the oil delivery today too! ^_^
1626 2018-01-04 21:42:25 Like the decline in coal and oil?
1627 2018-01-04 21:42:24 Smart, but you will be pressured to sell with intense tactics and still governments can seize owned lands if it "benefits" the greater populous. People on oil make money buy selling it, they don't have legal jurisdiction over governments to use as political leverage
1628 2018-01-04 21:42:09 Trey better be considering the tourism industry in SC. Compare our beaches to Louisiana and the Galveston area of TX. They are grungy with oil residue. I’ve lived in both states and know their beaches. More strength for the SC #BlueTsunami2018
1629 2018-01-04 21:42:08 Lol, too quick to make wrong comparisons, there's a level playing field and ethics for oil marketers supported by the government, the Dangotes are the working system you've been praying for, wish I can see you in person to talk...
1630 2018-01-04 21:42:07 oil club
1631 2018-01-04 21:42:05 I would rather the US move into the 21 st century like the rest of these countries that R developing clean renewable energy. We're getting left behind in industries now because these dam politicians wanted their pockets padded by the oil industry when we could've led the industry
1632 2018-01-04 21:42:04 Oil
1633 2018-01-04 21:42:04 Who's been selling you this snake oil.
1634 2018-01-04 21:42:02 Oil almost never sell high so I understand the thinking.....but yeah I'd hate it a bit.
1635 2018-01-04 21:41:53 Many thanks to road crews, utilities, fuel oil companies, law enforcement, and first responders who are enduring difficult conditions during this storm to clear roads, heat homes, and keep us all safe. Vermonters are grateful!
1636 2018-01-04 21:41:45 Backshots and Beyoncé: A Gun Oil production
1637 2018-01-04 21:41:36 .@Interior’s offshore drilling announcement is great news for our paymasters. It means more dirty and dangerous jobs, more profits for oil barons, and more devastation to our environment right here in America.
1638 2018-01-04 21:41:28 This battle was fought a long time ago for many years. 
CA doesn’t not want off shore drilling. 
Besides-shouldn’t we be depending more  alternative fuels and less on fossil fuels?  
This is a play for oil companies while the environment and citizens get screwed. 
ENOUGH!!
1639 2018-01-04 21:41:28 And it’s a *draft* proposed plan. It’s a long way to first lease, let alone first oil. Factor in public comment, lease sale proposal, G&G, and complexity of offshore plays...Zinke is reaching a bit for energy dominance talking point when effect won’t be felt for a decades.
1640 2018-01-04 21:41:22 Things to buy for new apartment that I dont already have:
1. Vic's humidifier
2. Oil difuser
1641 2018-01-04 21:41:15 Yes, because the oceans definitely need more oil floating on the surface when the wells leak.  Or explode.  #RenewableEnergy
1642 2018-01-04 21:41:09 I'm really at a drive-through oil change. 2018 weird 
1643 2018-01-04 21:41:04 EVEN the oil money isn't reaching to the poor,the vampires that called themselves leaders will share the money hand to hand,nigeria don't have a leaders but a looters.They have destroy our land and polluted it,God giving resources is now a course to us,biafra is our last hope.

1647 2018-01-04 21:40:36 Damn haven't took my cbd oil in like months & I finally took some today & a bitch is hella lit 
1648 2018-01-04 21:40:34 i'm not saying it's not awesome, but i am saying prepared for your genitals to feel weird and for your skin to feel as if it's been soaked in olive oil.
but i think it's still a good lawsuit.
1649 2018-01-04 21:40:24 it is truly a dream come true, if you've got one of those pots i can send you the recipe - if you don't i bet you could do it in a slow cooker. 1/4 cup miso, 1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce, 3 tbsp gochujang, 1 tbsp sesame oil, and a tsp of black pepper.

1651 2018-01-04 21:40:19 I use oregano oil and it taste bad but kills everything keeps me working even though my kiddo brings home all sorts of illnesses from school
1652 2018-01-04 21:40:15 We need to grow non fossil fuel energy production not oil. There's a glut as is. You're so obviously on the take it's ridiculous.
1653 2018-01-04 21:40:08 これ？ドレッシングっていうか廃油。
1654 2018-01-04 21:40:07 EZ shares +1.7%, US shares +0.4% helped by strong data. US 10 yr yld flat at 2.45%. Oil +0.5% to $61.9. ASX futures +0.7%. $A 0.7865
1655 2018-01-04 21:40:07 So you can make aasumptions about ppl but ppl cant make assumptions about you? You a child on an oil rig.
1656 2018-01-04 21:39:59 You should try CBD oil for pain. Great stuff and it doesn't get you high. There is different forms of CBD , we all have CBD receptors. Doterra has a great CBD oil!
1657 2018-01-04 21:39:57 No you clearly don’t get it, Saudi’s will have a place in the market unless tariffs are implemented. Drill all you want, Saudi oil will be imported at lower cost than American.
1658 2018-01-04 21:39:51 Oil wars. The US and UK have been running roughshod over the Middle East since the end of WWI.
1659 2018-01-04 21:39:47 Oil of Oregano EO. As soon as I feel it coming on I take it internally. I diffuse it or put it in capsules for my daughter as she hates the taste!
1660 2018-01-04 21:39:43 Also Oil Pipelines are too easy for SABOTAGE to destroy oil access & ecosystems not to mention harming water supplies & people
1661 2018-01-04 21:39:42 Great work opening drilling offshore! Now stop Food for fuel! Ethanol does not belong in gasoline! Corn should be for people and animals to eat! Oil is almost a glut! Abolish the ethanol requirement!
1662 2018-01-04 21:39:31 Of course he is & probably owns or will own oil companys

Whatever you do do not argue with emotion about ethics on us of the planet. People who make oil money don't care and are terrified of being economically poor.
1665 2018-01-04 21:39:14 One campaign promise Obama kept. 
Promised to skyrocket price of electricity.
1666 2018-01-04 21:39:06 We don't need more oil drilling in the ocean. What we need is more renewable energy.

1668 2018-01-04 21:38:55 Wow. The president of Nigeria; the greatest black nation in the world, 6th highest oil producing country in the world:  Commissioned  2 locomotive trains today. It is well with us.
1669 2018-01-04 21:38:52 Beard care is very important in this cold weather. Gentlemen; aanndd maybe some ladies, take your biotin and use your argan oil daily. 
1670 2018-01-04 21:38:47 Creating jobs skimming oil off of the seas surface, dabbing it off the beaches with paper towels and burying the dead wildlife. Another great republican jobs plan. #shameful
1671 2018-01-04 21:38:44 Trump to increase offshore drilling while making it more expensive to go solar, the intent to keep us enslaved to oil! While for the first time since the industrial revolution, England was powered mostly by renewable energy!
1672 2018-01-04 21:38:41 @Devin_Heroux I went to get an oil change. Wait was 1 1/2 hours. Place had wifi. Sat in my truck and watched the Jones/Nicholls game. Pulled out of the service bay just as the game ended #iamcanadian
1673 2018-01-04 21:38:40 What kind of shrewd businessman would invest in offshore drilling with oil at $60 a barrel?
1674 2018-01-04 21:38:40 Wish there was this much outrage when the Sioux Nation was lacking heating oil for homes and schools across reservations.

1681 2018-01-04 21:37:59 My coconut oil hard as hell its so cold
1682 2018-01-04 21:37:55 So far Michael Wolff, John Oliver and the Oil and gas industry seem to be the big winners of the Trump Admin.
1683 2018-01-04 21:37:50 The cost of gas went up at the pump due to the increased taxes the oil giants have to pay. Pass it on to consumers, did you think about that?
1684 2018-01-04 21:37:47 Its taken Trump a year to start doing real damage-but in one day he has cut off Pakistan from aid- opening the door wide to China.
Opening up all of Americas coastlines to oil drilling- Oh and gone to war with states that have legal Marijuana sales.  1 day!
#Trump
1685 2018-01-04 21:37:46 Honestly, do not argue with emotion.  Oil and gas has a top down effect on economy so you need studies to prove to oil rich states that economically Oil and gas is bad idea. Also begin to work with indigenous American groups who have some bigger forms of political protections 1/2
1686 2018-01-04 21:37:40 DON'T PROTEST OIL IF YOU STILL BUY PETROLEUM PRODUCTS LITERALLY ANYTHING PLASTIC
1687 2018-01-04 21:37:38 ¿Que tal si por cada litro de gas oil que cargo en mi camioneta me cobraran cada vez menos? ¿No sería justo eso?
1688 2018-01-04 21:37:37 If there is a beard oil company that is willing to give me a life time supply of beard oil... that would be great
1689 2018-01-04 21:37:35 Yes, but think about the Big Oil campaign cash for 2018 and 2020. That's what this is about, right, Senator?
1690 2018-01-04 21:37:22 Me neither. And how she know the oil temp? lol

1694 2018-01-04 21:36:55 And seriously.....What kind of an America will we be with Oil Spills in our Swimming Areas, Coal Dust In our Lungs, Beautiful Natl Parks closed for Drilling....You and the Prez are doing Everything to Take Away America’s Goodness! I am Disgusted!
1695 2018-01-04 21:36:54 almost put vape oil on my face instead of argan oil wowWWEE
1696 2018-01-04 21:36:49 Tea tree oil worked for mine. Just dab a little on a q-tip
1697 2018-01-04 21:36:45 I use Cetaphil oil control foam wash , Blemish control Apricot  scrub , and A facial clay masque . And I use Purpose face moisturizer  . Make sure u stay hydrated and witch hazel or rose water is great for your skin after you wash it
1698 2018-01-04 21:36:41 Thank you AG Becerra, do not want oil rigs to ruin our beaches what about SB562 doesn't every Californian deserve healthcare and isn't time to consider independence
1699 2018-01-04 21:36:27 Just slather it with mayonnaise, its egg... so it's gotta be healthy, right? (Seriously; get some Tahini, Olive Oil, Lemon, Garlic; mix that together, its a great dressing for raw veggies/salads, the Tahini makes it a bit thicker)
1700 2018-01-04 21:36:17 Or, is this the first steps toward "isolationism" and the need to find new sources of oil since eventually no one will want to work with the US?
1701 2018-01-04 21:36:03 My hair loves olive oil i need to go get some ...
1702 2018-01-04 21:36:02 Oil of Olay!!! It’s works wonders
1703 2018-01-04 21:36:00 Thank you for helping to lower my blood pressure, just thinking about that. 
(Was just reading about DJT‘s latest – announced that they plan to open up *all* U.S. offshore waters to oil drilling.  )
1704 2018-01-04 21:35:58 The Trump action is silly. Oil industry doesn’t want this fight. And no elected official of either party (except maybe Nunes) will support it. Same in Florida
1705 2018-01-04 21:35:58 If you want to spend millions of untaxed dollars to carelessly drill for oil off the coast & be held immune from any environmental damage or deaths your drilling causes then @realDonaldTrump & the @GOP have you covered
1706 2018-01-04 21:35:46 Just give us our Tax Cut. We don't care about your Grandmother or clean Air. Just make it cheaper to buy Chinese products at Walmart and you can drill for oil on all our beaches and bomb whomever you choose.
1707 2018-01-04 21:35:41 You can thank trump for that next oil spill!
1708 2018-01-04 21:35:40 Again. This is a stupid tweet. & btw I drive a hybrid, I supplement with a wood stove. Keep the house electric and oil down to a minimum. Because I am a sane adult who likes science, real econ & facts. Again utter idiocy to say this expansion is smart. Idiocy.
1709 2018-01-04 21:35:31 Don't we have enough snake oil salesmen in Congress already?
1710 2018-01-04 21:35:25 Ugh, I can't even keep up with all of the shitty things he's up to. Dear @SecretaryZinke, this planet > oil/gas money.

1715 2018-01-04 21:35:02 You cant regulate the death and accidents out of every single thing. Like the bp oil spill it was concrete and human errors. Unfortunately things happen. These conpanies dont drill to blow shit up and lose millions just like you dont cook to burn your house down but more die....
1716 2018-01-04 21:35:01 You all are wasting your time trying to change his mind....he is beholden to the gas and oil industry...that is where is loyalty lies....sad really...he is leaving a planet to his grandkids that will be ruined for the sake of the almighty $$
1717 2018-01-04 21:35:00 I agree and would point out that this is exactly why we need the carbon fee and dividend proposed by Citizens Climate Lobby.  Let's put a price on carbon, send the fees back to tax payers and reduce demand for oil and gas  and the need to drill.

1720 2018-01-04 21:34:42 Of course they are. There must be no oil rigs close to Trump golf courses.
1721 2018-01-04 21:34:40 If you honk at me .025 seconds after the light turns green I’m going to put my vehicle in park, adjust my seat, check my tire pressure, change my oil, return some emails, eat a snack, read a book, brush my teeth, nap, and build a lego set
1722 2018-01-04 21:34:31 Raw onion and garlic work too, but are stinky. Peppermint oil is ideal.

1725 2018-01-04 21:34:17 Man this ocean is nice but ya know what would make it REALLY SHINE? 

Oil!
1726 2018-01-04 21:34:02 We love it! Saves a ton in carbon emissions by reducing the distance oil has to be transported to the US. Much greener than not drilling.
1727 2018-01-04 21:33:58 But the engine was totalled. The oil pump malfunctioned somehow but the light didn't stay on.
1728 2018-01-04 21:33:52 Well I can stand in front of the oil tank and watch the gauge go down.  Office is a bit breezy but we r working on that. Thanks for asking!!
1729 2018-01-04 21:33:40 It absolutely disgusts me to see the lifting of environmental protections and todays news of allowing oil rigs to operate in most of our coastal waters.
1730 2018-01-04 21:33:39 Another reason to oppose offshore drilling: Political suicide. Florida's large, growing & increasingly blue citizenry won't support pols who put oil rigs before its environment, fisheries, tourism. Two words: Deepwater Horizon. @marcorubio @RepGusBilirakis @FLGovScott

Let me know how it goes.

1745 2018-01-04 21:32:37 I don't think you should. Oil marketers are out of the black market,I don't see higher dollar value.
1746 2018-01-04 21:32:25 My pleasure.   Have a super duper day

1748 2018-01-04 21:32:19 Salt and oil in it lol tasty tho
1749 2018-01-04 21:32:07 for example, dodd frank (trump hates) ensures investment banks cant borrow money from consumer affiliates to gamble on the market. CFPB exists to ensure consumers are protected from big banks, etc. environmental regs exist to protect our planet, not to piss off oil execs.

1761 2018-01-04 21:31:05 I understand but there are environmental impacts with all types of energy. Our entire transport system is based in oil. Can't wish that away

1778 2018-01-04 21:29:24 news for you I know. But for my 93 year old mother on low income, it's been major weather for 3 weeks now trying to keep warm inside. Wake up Justin! You should be very worried about how your aging citizens are going to survive cold streaks after u r finished closing our oil/gas
1779 2018-01-04 21:29:18 i just got my two 4oz bottles of @CannaSmack cleansing oil and im happy knowing i will probably never have to buy more for the rest of my life
1780 2018-01-04 21:29:15 You know how tech companies boost their valuation by buying start ups and stockpiling patents? Oil companies boost their valuation by stockpiling oil leases. They aren't using millions of acres of leases. Expanding leases doesn't add output, it just boosts oil stocks.
1781 2018-01-04 21:29:10 My brothers GEJ'S Leadership naivity is the reason why we are suffering today. No time had Nigeria experienced much money flows from oil than in his 6yrs in power. God did that so that we push the money into fixing our education, infrastructure, healthcare,etc. He wasted it all.
1782 2018-01-04 21:29:09 It's below $70 today. So you deregulate & car companies don't have to meet higher mileage per gallon standards. You open up oil fields that can only produce expensive oil. Whose happy? The people selling oil =) but not the American citizen spending more than their tax cut on gas
1783 2018-01-04 21:29:07 Really. That's why I call them snake oil salesmen. They take people who are desperate for a cure for their problem, and sell them something dangerous and doesn't work. Snake oil.

1785 2018-01-04 21:28:35 I'm sorry you've felt the bite from extremely bent Oil fans.  Vast majority of us are extremely passionate, but respectful about the Oil and never cross this line that some have with you.  Heck, we let Gretz eat in peace in public.  These so called fans need a lesson in manners.
1786 2018-01-04 21:28:27 With low oil prices and current onshore production why the need for offshore drilling to this extent.
1787 2018-01-04 21:28:24 Christian Book Distributors. They do devotionals, study bibles. Mostly popular & conservative/non-threatening material. If you want a messianic anointing oil shofar along with your dispensationalist theology start there.
1788 2018-01-04 21:28:23 How in the world do you make facials and oil extracting sound sexy af.  DAMN LADY @tnwhiskeywoman
1789 2018-01-04 21:28:18 I'm already working on trying to stop the next NeoCon Aggression whether it is GOP or Democratic.

Working on standing up to the Oil, Coal & Nuclear profiteers.

Standing with the folks from #NoDAPL & #BlackLivesMatter

1790 2018-01-04 21:28:18 Have you tried sweet oil?
1791 2018-01-04 21:28:12 Believe me, you don't want your children walking on #oil laden coastline. It is traumatic to see #birds, seals, and other #ocean life suffocate due to #oil spills. #NotAgain #SantaBarabaraOilSpill #GOO
1792 2018-01-04 21:28:07 No refineries
No agro based plants
Yet we are the largest producers of oil, pineapples and cassava.
WHICH WAY NIGERIA MY COUNTRY?
1793 2018-01-04 21:28:06 Harris nixed windmills but now his boy is going to erect oil rigs
1794 2018-01-04 21:28:04 They're all promised a peerage for lying to the public to support Tory / Unionist bullshit, a bit like the Oil only lasting another 10 years crap from another Unionist Expert.
1795 2018-01-04 21:28:03 President Trump has released a proposal to open off-shore drilling in most US continental shelf waters. 

Only 26 areas of the Arctic, Pacific, Gulf of Mexico & the Atlantic Ocean would be protected from oil/gas exploration.

1796 2018-01-04 21:28:01 Yes I am sure your children will thank? you for all the deregulation yr dad cut when our air is polluted, water poisoned and lakes filled with oil from GREEDY PAPA TRUMP.
1797 2018-01-04 21:27:52 Wrap and 3 bites filed: Another fight is about to begin over drilling for oil and gas off the coast of Florida. #fnnnews

1800 2018-01-04 21:27:40 A bit yeh, cocoa butter, cacao powder, cinnamon ginger nutmeg and orange oil with a dash of honey to sweeten. Taste pretty good, doubt they’ll last long!
1801 2018-01-04 21:27:38 My oil light has been on for 6 days & when I can finally take it in they’re too busy to work on my car 
1802 2018-01-04 21:27:37 No matter how hard I scub... my hands will still be grease and oil stained. Like how fuckin cute is that 
1803 2018-01-04 21:27:35 He has to appease his oil and gas donors. The GOP does not care about people, only their donors.
1804 2018-01-04 21:27:33 With oil drilling opening up in the Atlantic, how about a rig within sight of Mar A Lago. Just because .....

1809 2018-01-04 21:27:19 God's never ending blessings to this county in the form of natural resources, particularly oil and natural gas, are a big part of why we are so much better off than we should be given the mismanagement, dependency, debt, and soft socialism.
1810 2018-01-04 21:27:17 So like if you mix together coconut oil, coconut milk, coconut flakes, coconut water, coconut cream, and coconut flour, do you end up with just, like, a coconut?
1811 2018-01-04 21:27:17 Me 50% of nights: fully takes off makeup and does 30 mins of skincare and feels incredible afterwards

The other 50%: falls in bed face first after haphazardly wiping with coconut oil trying to ignore that I’ll regret it in the morning.
1812 2018-01-04 21:27:16 Thats crazy. We had a handfull of hurricanes and major storms in the East. The Atlantic Coast does not need a major oil spill nor does the Pacific. The extent of loss to wildlife and or human life would be the worst ever recorded. Why? Why? Why?  Crazy
1813 2018-01-04 21:27:15 I don’t laugh at people. I just think that it’s funny. You have to be from the north to see how funny it looks. I don’t think that anyone should feel bad for it. We are less likely to know how to do simple things like change oil in cars. That’s normal down here.
1814 2018-01-04 21:27:15 You do clean them. The black colour is a result of binding oil and steel (it’s called seasoning the pan). That’s what makes it non-stick
1815 2018-01-04 21:27:09 Covered in hydraulic oil...nice
1816 2018-01-04 21:26:50 Niggas will go broke buying Jordans, iPhones and knock off designer belts and don’t know how to change oil, change a flat or how to put antifreeze in they car.. How that go!? 
1817 2018-01-04 21:26:44 @thehill Does the world really need more oil rigs appox 5000 already in gulf not including all oil production in rest ofworld
1818 2018-01-04 21:26:38 I don't believe it's worth ruining coastal communities in the long run, for a short term problem. Also, we get over 60% of our oil from north america... with the rest coming from places like nigeria, (yes from saudi arabia) but only a small amount.)
1819 2018-01-04 21:26:38 Walmart, why do you take FOREVER to change oil?
1820 2018-01-04 21:26:27 Please don't let this disaster of a plan get lost in all the crazyness. It is CRITICAL that Zenke/Trump are stopped - opening up 90% of our waters to oil drilling is insanity.

1833 2018-01-04 21:25:30 @McKinsey Bad data metaphors: It's the new gold; it's the new oil. Gold is horded  oil is burned. Data is the steel of the digital economy. Usually hidden but supporting everything. #BigData #Analytics
1834 2018-01-04 21:25:22 The Dow hit 25,000 today. The Government is building the wall. We are finally drilling for oil, and all the media will talk about is that silly book.

1839 2018-01-04 21:25:02 The gang that can't shoot straight. However if you read comments at WSJ you'll see pontificating, ad nauseam, on Trump's brilliance; ever so industrious to kick start jobs with open coal mining and ocean oil pits everywhere! Revenge legislating!

1852 2018-01-04 21:24:07 And any Oil execs that do this will be punished by the next congress and administration, Lets see I think the going fine for an oil spill should be 1.5 trillion dollars . due immediately.

1856 2018-01-04 21:24:00 Sure....cause there’s a buttload of oceanfront property owners in Wisconsin that would just love to gaze upon oil rigs from the Wisconsin beaches.
1857 2018-01-04 21:23:59 The beaches in the United States are already polluted and disgusting. So lets make them even worse by letting companies drill for Oil of the coast. #notmypresident #itsallaboutthemoney
1858 2018-01-04 21:23:55 That'll help... I always hated unobstructed views at the beach. And there's never enough oil in my sand.

 My life just got a whole lot better because of this. 
1869 2018-01-04 21:23:10 because it’s an old oil lamp: the wick goes in the ‘spout’, you fill the inside with oil by pouring it into the larger hole in the body, and the wick absorbs it
1870 2018-01-04 21:22:43 Remember to shovel out your dryer vents and oil fills if you get oil.
1871 2018-01-04 21:22:39 Everyone is all excited about his reducing regulation and it has excited business (and our portfolio is loving it) but much has been stuff that is not to the citizens long term advantage. Oil fields opened up that only can be profitably extracted at over $70 a barrel. (Next)
1872 2018-01-04 21:22:38 put oil in lamp, put wick in spout, light wick
1873 2018-01-04 21:22:26 Man I’m about to pee my pants while they’re doing my oil change
1874 2018-01-04 21:22:08 But we’ll happily buy oil from those countries who want to kill us and that pesky Socialist in Venezuela who is starving his people. How about energy clean independence from oil and sun? Or do you want the 3rd world to fuel your limo?

What risks are you actually talking about?
1878 2018-01-04 21:21:41 We are a stronger and safer and more prosperous country if we have energy independence, Congresswoman.

The oil will be drilled for somewhere in the world. It will be better for the planet to obtain the oil from American holdings.
1879 2018-01-04 21:21:40 Let me get this right.  @StephenBannon goes rouge calls @DonaldJTrumpJr a traitor and then the next day @jeffsessions announces he's going after pot and @RyanZinke says start drilling all coasts for oil. I smell cover up/distraction. #fuckingfilth

1885 2018-01-04 21:21:12 .@JerryBrownGov joins Governors of Oregon and WA in condemning federal decision to expand offshore oil and gas drilling. Vow to stop "this reckless, short-sighted action."
1886 2018-01-04 21:21:12 Dying? It’s oil man. We always need oil. If we don’t drill for it, other nations will. It’s in our own backyard!!!

Mr Bendall heads Empire Energy that announced in January it was “part of an international consortium, formed to explore for oil, gas and helium in the Tasmania Basin"
1888 2018-01-04 21:21:08 CA needs a ballot initiative to block drilling off-shore and finally impose an extraction fee for oil produced in California.
1889 2018-01-04 21:21:06 I’m blocked too 
1890 2018-01-04 21:21:06 As always, it's the Orange Counties & big suburbs, as well as large extractive industries (agriculture, mining, oil) leeching the life blood of the urban core of LA, SF, Berkeley, Oakland, San Jose, even San Diego & its laboring classes
1891 2018-01-04 21:20:55 Does anyone think that F&F kerfuffle is to distract us from the trump admin opening offshore drilling for his oil buds?

1896 2018-01-04 21:20:24 Like all unionists you focus on the headline barrel price. When it went over $100 there was not a unionist head to be seen, they were all under the sand. Oil is a worldwide traded commodity, extraction costs have fallen, while market prices rise, in anyones book, thats good news
1897 2018-01-04 21:20:22 Alaskans are fools for (evidently) demanding that we destroy ANWR in addition to the 90% of coastal plain that’s already dedicated to oil exploration. All for your teeny weenie dividend checks.
1898 2018-01-04 21:20:15 Just surprised, was 350 degree oil. Phone was so hot I couldn't hold it.
1899 2018-01-04 21:20:10 Oh good - I love talking about oil - Did you see the price recently? And the reports that WoS lifting costs have been reduced to $20? and NS Lifting costs to mid 30s of dollars...all we need now is a Westminster able to deal with the oil companies and actually tax them.
1900 2018-01-04 21:20:03 Bill, do you mean 'repeat' of Trump's vebal stupidity in approving new sites, repeat of the destructive greed of Big Oil, or repeat of massive clean-ups to the fragile coast ?
1901 2018-01-04 21:20:01 This will be devastating to our beautiful coastal waters! I remember what when Louisiana was devastated with an oil spill and we lost our coast and wildlife.
1902 2018-01-04 21:19:49 Not likely. No companies are going to put up new rigs w/oil prices so low. And we already have a shortage of workers in the industry so there's are already jobs that need to be filled.

Check into reality sometime. I'm sure someone there misses you.
1903 2018-01-04 21:19:46 tank full & oil changed. just needa wash it.
1904 2018-01-04 21:19:44 According to a WH memo , Trump is going to allow Chinese and Saudi companies  to drill oil off the costs of Alaska and California.  This was part of a deal to build the " transcontinental pipeline " from the Pacific to Texas . For Real.
1905 2018-01-04 21:19:39 There’s this ‘What to Buy’ feature in this magazine: ‘Radiance Face Oil’ £60.

A Qatari genie this time?
1916 2018-01-04 21:18:36 Remind everyone repeatedly that #GOP supposedly stand for states rights. But not when both private prisons and oil companies want something different. Point out their continuing hypocrisy. They deserve it. #Conservative in name only. #statesrights
1917 2018-01-04 21:18:32 I'm a female liberal who regularly gets called snowflake for my opinions...and I've known how to pump my own gas, check & fill my oil, check transmission fluid, and perform a whole host of other minor car maintenance. So who's the frickin' whiny snowflake now?
1918 2018-01-04 21:18:31 You are not doing much to stop Trump from killing the environment? Now, he wants to drill for oil everywhere. Why worry now about the Mississippi when it's going to be contaminated?
1919 2018-01-04 21:18:31 Simple oil of cloves...
1920 2018-01-04 21:18:28 Since beginning of the protests in Iran #KSA chose wrong side. They chose separatists and terrorist groups which killed three border guards in Piranshahr and then exploded an oil facility. #KSA gave excuse to Mullahs to mark protesters as ISIL and terrorists.
1921 2018-01-04 21:18:21 U S military has proof of Russia shipping NK oil and goods, and military intelligence  (against UN sanctions), that's not even bothering you? 
You are calling our military liars then. 
Running "scare"?
1922 2018-01-04 21:18:17 U.S. in the right path for oil and energy production world dominance. When China, Russia, India, Venezuela and many others countries comply with the environmental protection requirements and contribute equitably to the environmental issue as U.S. then we speak.
1923 2018-01-04 21:18:16 Is there any oil near Mar a Lago?
1924 2018-01-04 21:18:08 Been feeding my skin with  just  skin
Plumping oils and coconut oil for 4moths... My skin feels and looks so amazing...
1925 2018-01-04 21:18:03 I’ve gone out literally everyday this week. And my skin is finally paying for it. 
Its so dry and crackly that no face oil can save it 
1926 2018-01-04 21:17:58 But I’m currently using a blean of olive, coconut and almond oil and my skin feels great and looks great. #yallcare
1927 2018-01-04 21:17:58 BS, he wants to allow drilling on our coasts, given the damage oil spills cause, this is not sanity.
1928 2018-01-04 21:17:57 Trump Administration Proposes Opening Almost All US Coastal Waters to Oil Drilling
1929 2018-01-04 21:17:54 First five oil platforms should be right in front of mar-a-lago.

1935 2018-01-04 21:17:17 It occurs to me that we don't have a helluva lot of oil to sell - even if we drill to guarantee future Americans will have none whatsoever, even in a crisis. The Republicans in Congress & the White House are certainly stripping us of natural resources & $$$ as fast as they can.
1936 2018-01-04 21:17:17 One thing for sure, lots of GM and coaching changes coming in offseason for Oil, Habs and Ott miss playoffs
1937 2018-01-04 21:17:01 OK We are paying at the pump for this irresponsibility. When the DEM Congress comes in & TRUMP is gone (we hope by then) all this will be reversed. The oil Cos know this so I see Lawsuits then .Attorneys Win We Will Lose.

1939 2018-01-04 21:16:57 @CannabisExperts  Can anyone sell CBD oil?  I've read that some companies are saying that they are legally allowed to sell CBD oil with no THC in it (legal with zero THC)... any truth to this?  Or do only LP's have the right to legally sell CBD oil?

1943 2018-01-04 21:16:20 dunno. I wouldn't fool with her tho! She ain't gonna have me out here rocking tie-dyed dashikis and smelling like cheap body oil while chewing on a tree branch, rocking an ankh ring.

1946 2018-01-04 21:16:06 Not true - check respiratory ailments for those living in heavily industrialized chemical and oil processing plants. Data is real and folks living in those area suffer medical issues as a result.
1947 2018-01-04 21:16:06 I think the Habs and Oil could work out a deal that helps both clubs. Pac on the wing with McD would be fun to watch.
1948 2018-01-04 21:16:05 Yeah, no one uses oil anymore...
1949 2018-01-04 21:16:04 my face is getting so much better after using tea tree oil 
1950 2018-01-04 21:15:58 I really miss the good old days of George W. You know, when wars were bout oil and not whose nuclear button is bigger.

Every.

Single.

1953 2018-01-04 21:15:39 It is not because of a shortage of oil. It is is for money, gain and greed.
1954 2018-01-04 21:15:39 So it’s ok to drill in other countries because it’s not here... right? Being independent and not having to have our people die on foreign soil because of oil is what the goal is. You’d rather keep us in wars and our people dying, yeah I’m not buying that bull
1955 2018-01-04 21:15:26 ok but it could’ve been oil or wax that he was buying
1956 2018-01-04 21:15:24 They question Trump mental stability, but this switch is normal? No expert here but seems slightly unstable to me.
1957 2018-01-04 21:15:21 Once he is a fictional amalgam of a big town -- West is a torturous and its destiny General content being outside of oil.
1958 2018-01-04 21:15:18 It's "the oil on the pig" con ... btw.   Make sure nothing you say is clear,  so you can unpin yourself from it by gaslighting others and saying THEY misunderstood you.   

The lack of clarity in someone who leads (And lead a business before this) indicates a few things.

1960 2018-01-04 21:15:14 Couldn’t disagree more. I’m all for clean energy, but it’s decades away, if not longer. Meanwhile, tractor trailers and the poor won’t be able to afford electric cars. We need oil, no reason to buy it from our sworn enemies in the Middle East. Put Americans to work.

1962 2018-01-04 21:15:08 Has anyone tried oil cooling?
1963 2018-01-04 21:15:05 Alex, please tell your channel that if you lose power, you cant use your oil furnace either.  Some 1 on channel, didn't catch his name, was talking about losing power and that unless you have oil you will be in trouble.  An oil furnace needs electricity to operate.
1964 2018-01-04 21:15:05 also a tea tree oil thing
1965 2018-01-04 21:15:03 Interview done, changed my oil worked out and did all my laundry. I’m on top of it now!
1966 2018-01-04 21:15:02 Storing it in tankers means oil is technically "in transit" and so not taxed, a concept pioneered by the late Anthony "Spag" Borgatti many years ago.
1967 2018-01-04 21:14:59 President Donald Trump has a  goal: energy dominance. He doesn't care about oil spills or leaks..... making his friends rich, and quite possible himself!
1968 2018-01-04 21:14:45 We shouldn't use depletable fossil fuels. We should use renewable fuels. 

Like wood.

And whale oil.
1969 2018-01-04 21:14:44 So long as they use beard oil. I don't need my face all scratched up.

1972 2018-01-04 21:14:32 baby oil the only other suggestion lol
1973 2018-01-04 21:14:31 In addition,in many states,it can only be sold as an oil,so no burning or smoking. Plus, I'll bet this dickhead smokes cigarettes &/or cigars, & even if he doesn't, screw him.When he has an autistic kid or a kid having multiple seizures/day, then he can decide to make it illegal.
1974 2018-01-04 21:14:22 It was!! Nothing like ciabatta with good olive oil and balsamic vinegar! #nom
1975 2018-01-04 21:14:19 Visited the Etihad this week for the match against Watford... 6 seats around us apparently filled minimal times a year... 3 on an oil rig 2 live in Poland . Be interesting to see if clubs pulled out a quota of there actual tickets sold over the year

1979 2018-01-04 21:13:43 Time for more solar and renewable energy, and time for less coal and oil.  America needs to be a 21st century leader again.
1980 2018-01-04 21:13:41 y’all need to get hip and invest in an essential oil diffuser this year!
1981 2018-01-04 21:13:37 The irony is some @GOP millionaire/billionaire oil investors and CEOs live on the expensive coastline and don't want oil pollution on their doorsteps.
1982 2018-01-04 21:13:35 @AK_47UK ran into our conversation last month and made his claims that oil will rise because "OPEC and Shale want it" and also that "the EIA weekly numbers are overstating US oil production". Now he blocks us when he is confronted on the fact that his EIA claims were wrong #OOTT.
1983 2018-01-04 21:13:22 Please help us stay timely with our oil deliveries.  Keep your driveway and or path to your fill pipe clear and safe for our drivers.  If you order oil from us online or by phone as needed, please allow extra time for your delivery to arrive.  Thanks for your help!
1984 2018-01-04 21:13:12 I just wonder if he would be affected in the case of an oil spill. Do you want an oil well next door to you? I grew up in an oil field, I know how polluting they can be. It's easy to talk, if you don't have to pay the price.
1985 2018-01-04 21:13:11 Democratic senator doesn't agree with conservative needs. Who would have thought that would happen. The idea is to get away from using oil in general. Renewables are the future

1990 2018-01-04 21:12:55 It's definitely not easy! I just left it to dry out for an hour to make sure all the water was out and put it in the pan with oil and left it so the sides got browned

1992 2018-01-04 21:12:52 We'll see if this backfires and creates sustained opposition to #offshore #oil and #gas undermining future exploration campaigns in the #US OCS
1993 2018-01-04 21:12:49 This year has taught many things, incl how vulnerable our coasts are to  extreme weather. That the lesson to be drawn from this is to place even  more oil & gas drilling rigs, pipelines, & infrastructure off our coasts and in the paths of these intensifying storms is oxymoronic.
1994 2018-01-04 21:12:35 The Argan oil perfect edge control is good too.
1995 2018-01-04 21:12:30 @NYCMayor @NYCMayorsOffice @cmlauriecumbo @nyc311 I am getting nowhere to fixing heat in my apartment. 311 has no answers for emergency oil delivery. Oil companies are saying that the @NYC_DOT is prohibiting oil trucks from being on the roads. What are we suppose to do?!?
1996 2018-01-04 21:12:29 Oh look here’s @SenSanders giving a speech in a vat of Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, here’s Sanders endorsing big oil candidates, here’s Sanders sporting $700 snowboard jacket, here’s Sanders jetting off to Rome penthouse suite, selling books, etc etc  #capitalist

1999 2018-01-04 21:12:21 hahaha. well the good news is you only NEED 4 steps to start and you never need to expand past there if you don't want to. oil cleanser, foam cleanser, moisturizer, sunscreen! (alternatively, oil, toner, moisturizer, sunscreen)
2000 2018-01-04 21:12:17 I take CBD oil for chronic pain. I've had doctors practically try to force feed me Vicodin and Oxy, but I always refused. Let's just say, by the way, CBD oil isn't the cheapest (or easiest) thing to acquire in a state as red as mine.
2001 2018-01-04 21:12:09 I never tried even eating it. I do have some CBD oil, but i might use it someday
2002 2018-01-04 21:12:08 Follow cyclical oil and gas values NDP had nothing to do with this expansion, volatility in the Middle East corruption in Venezuela has lead to an increase in oil and will continue to hence the market prediction

2004 2018-01-04 21:12:04 I think wind turbines would be better suited but I don't have an agenda to destroy the planet like big oil does for pure profit.
2005 2018-01-04 21:12:03 Ori mixed with coconut oil (and any other essential oils you can get) that's what I use. With black soap for wash.
2006 2018-01-04 21:11:53 i think the plan is to get away from oil altogether...
2007 2018-01-04 21:11:49 So are you going to stop relations with Middle East now?  Or are you going to let Saudi Aramco come get our oil?
2008 2018-01-04 21:11:46 Me too

5 Billion in oil. .. BTW did Trump sign those Russian sanctions yet??
2009 2018-01-04 21:11:46 This is amazing rose I love it what did you use? Oil pastels?
2010 2018-01-04 21:11:45 the oil on that damn pillar made me smell like lube for a week
2011 2018-01-04 21:11:42 @AK_47UK could have just admitted his "profit" (that is if he traded) was based on dumb luck, and that he really doesn't know oil fundamentals. If you caught our conversation, he did indirectly admit that he trades off narratives (again, that is IF he trades).
2012 2018-01-04 21:11:32 Thank You @BillHaslam For raising Tax's on fuel in Tennessee, now the oil and fuel prices are going up again. Large part of my pay now goes to fueling up. Thank's again for not cutting Gov't spending you Liberal Ass.
2013 2018-01-04 21:11:30 aaaa
2014 2018-01-04 21:11:30 That's right coal and oil that's the future

2016 2018-01-04 21:11:26 Have you ever made a scrub with them? I got coconut oil/essentials/baking soda/epsom salt for xmas and tried to make a scrub and it just came out a mess and idk where I went wrong because I followed Pinterest instructions 
2017 2018-01-04 21:11:22 We need to become a more self sufficient country!  Less relying on the Middle East for oil.  It’s baffling how the liberals jump on this bandwagon but have nothing to say about Iranian or other middle eastern woman rights!

2019 2018-01-04 21:11:16 I notice @RepMcClintock's fourth largest donor is the oil & gas industry. He is owned.
2020 2018-01-04 21:11:15 The rest of the world searches for clean energy while trump and the delusional band of merry men and woman back oil extraction. Can’t we just give them there own little bubble to die in.

2031 2018-01-04 21:10:19 Right because whats a little global climate change, the floods, tornadoes etc between friends.  Question tho, are the oil companies you jerks are sucking up to going to pay for the rebuilding after the massive storms or just let the poor pay for it as well?

2040 2018-01-04 21:09:49 If he went in and told California they had to accept a big old oil rig right in the middle of California that is a state right issue. In the costal waters that states do not have rights to and belongs to the federal government. Not the states.

2047 2018-01-04 21:09:36 "Men" claiming they don't know how, it's beneath them or too dangerous is hilarious.
2048 2018-01-04 21:09:34 In other words, Myrtle Beach gets oil platforms and Hilton Head does not.
2049 2018-01-04 21:09:33 Nooooo, pot smoking has nothing to do with it. Cures everything like snake oil!
2050 2018-01-04 21:09:31 They can use it to refine something else.

Or refine the Uganda oil and Tanzania oil once discovered.

Or just refine sewerage....
2051 2018-01-04 21:09:31 Whoever is spreading around that I'm a scam and a complete skid you can go shove your head in a bucket of boiling oil. Thank you.
2052 2018-01-04 21:09:28 Dear Mr.Ruchir Sharma
My query being an oil downstream professional :What is your openion regarding the trend of crude oil price in 2018?
2053 2018-01-04 21:09:27 Yes, now that GoT uses teleportation it's able to condense storylines by not having to travel thousands of miles.
2054 2018-01-04 21:09:25  cbd oil is the best!
2055 2018-01-04 21:09:17 Needed an oil change before driving 700+ miles back to Tuscaloosa tomorrow. But noooo, it’s too cold.

PS: it’s much warmer than it’s been recently... double digits!
2056 2018-01-04 21:09:14 @joerogan was just listening to the redban pod.. I think it's ethanol that burns clear, they run that in race cars. Petroleum is just oil.
2057 2018-01-04 21:09:11 The whole taking away Bears Ears was all about logging, coal, oil and geothermal leasing...it isn't to go to the people & State like he lied and told everyone (his base believed him too-suckers). That slipped by deceptively. You can read it yourself in the proclamation...
2058 2018-01-04 21:09:08 Easier said than done when Socialism has destroyed every other industry, and the oil one isn't faring well nowadays thanks to their malpractice
2059 2018-01-04 21:09:08 Same. There’s not enough coconut or sweet almond oil in the world to fix it.
2060 2018-01-04 21:09:06 So u are shifting to post now what is after that!! Oil drilling tax cuts ?!?! Lmao!!  Foo the investigation was based on Russian collusion!!!
2061 2018-01-04 21:09:05 Mostly he is just asking people what Obama did. Then he does the opposite.

Remove safety regulations, expand oil and coal, deny climate change, prosecute weed, screw the working class, re-enact the shady banking and aim for a new recession...
2062 2018-01-04 21:09:04 @Alt_EPA_Facts  What is the point of destroying our coastal waterways and the Arctic Refuge for oil drilling greed? Destroying the Gulf of Mexico and coasts will decimate the ocean life and tourism.
2063 2018-01-04 21:09:01 Didn't we learn from the oil spill in the gulf? Or the many others
2064 2018-01-04 21:08:59 When you are assigning responsibility for the crappy running of a country especially it's oil sector and local population - local government trumps foreign influence 100% of the time
2065 2018-01-04 21:08:57 My bedroom smells of olbas oil and I’ve got vaseline on my nose, feeling fresh af
2066 2018-01-04 21:08:50 The chemical responsible there is called eugenol. It's incredibly toxic in doses above 1mg, but in very small doses works great as a topical antibacterial and anaesthetic agent. "Clove essential oil" is generally synthesised eugenol. Not a bad milder alternative to lidocaine.
2067 2018-01-04 21:08:50 Do you think the U.S is too reliant on oil
2068 2018-01-04 21:08:48 Thank you, from one of your constituents. I do not want to see anymore oil rigs off our coasts. Please let us know what we can do to stop this.
2069 2018-01-04 21:08:38 Googling natural scalp treatments, basically treat your head like a salad; salt, olive oil, and lemon juice.
2070 2018-01-04 21:08:37 @AK_47UK just blocked me. Quite telling. If he were really such an oil expert, he'd have no problem challenging us for this entire year. Of course he knew his 60 call was dumb luck, and he risked getting exposed for all 2018. His EIA claims were already shown to be wrong.

2072 2018-01-04 21:08:32 I cannot wait to see oil on all the beaches, and all the Businesses are driven out of the gulf areas, and Tourists all go home, and yet Oil still goes higher and higher. While the rest of the World moves on to Sustainable Green Energy.
2073 2018-01-04 21:08:30 Maybe oil will penetrate Mar a Lago
2074 2018-01-04 21:08:27 Baby oil on them cheeks, bihhhh, u getting 3 minutes
2075 2018-01-04 21:08:23 We are being left so far behind with our insistence on clinging to outdated, filthy oil. Soon we will be a third world country with a crumbling infra-structure & fossil fuels nobody wants to buy.
2076 2018-01-04 21:08:20 That oil was too greasy...
2077 2018-01-04 21:08:19 And uses up or strategic oil reserves
2078 2018-01-04 21:08:18 By the way, I do think there is some trouble here near 62.50 in Crude Oil going back to 2015 highs, but if we manage to clear that at some point, we're looking at $85 oil as the next target. that's not nothing..... $CL_F $USO
2079 2018-01-04 21:08:15 can confirm that lavender oil pills are very calming
2080 2018-01-04 21:08:13 I know this is a gamble, but we NEED to reduce coal and oil consumption for hydro-electric by 25 percent over the next 10 years.  Coal plants will burn anything, and every city makes metric tons of garbage, and metric tons of methane in sanitation sludge.  Cheaper, easier, cleanr
2081 2018-01-04 21:08:05 That the rich are going to get richer. That they will be drilling for oil. That they will be selling weapons
2082 2018-01-04 21:07:55 Let's start with a big oil rig right off the coast from Mar A Lago
2083 2018-01-04 21:07:55 With my olbus oil on it u rude bitch
2084 2018-01-04 21:07:51 I live in The Netherlands and I use cannabis oil on daily basis. You can buy it everywhere and it's legal.
2085 2018-01-04 21:07:43 There should a policy 9f supporting all forms of energy. Plus if drilling or tracking occurs on federal the oil and gas companies have to pay to use that land and revenue to the government will increase allowing the debt to be paid off.
2086 2018-01-04 21:07:42 Folks forget that petroleum companies continue to lack a coherent emergency plan for underwater, deep sea oil spills. Well, I suppose we will get a reminder soon.
2087 2018-01-04 21:07:33 Serious question - what helps soothe a messed up snatch? I tried baby oil for a while, and ended up with an abscess 
2088 2018-01-04 21:07:33 Kasoy oil @ ₱240 
2089 2018-01-04 21:07:31 Off shore oil drilling?
2090 2018-01-04 21:07:30 My skin is just so good! Defo the oil because I’ve already used serums with not too much difference. Really corrected my oil and texture issues. Obsessed
2091 2018-01-04 21:07:27 Why would we only pursue "energy dominance" in oil & gas? And are environmentalists really the only ones who are outraged? Something tells me citizens living along the affected coasts aren't unanimously thrilled.
2092 2018-01-04 21:07:17 So #Trump drills for oil off our coastlines. Our endangered species being suffocated and poisoned to death to feed the greed of the #GOP.
2093 2018-01-04 21:07:14 This is why we must support #RenewableEnergy  as much as possible to keep oil from returning to a high value.. no value means no exploration! Lets not forget what wars are fought over!
2094 2018-01-04 21:07:13 Jaysus I could do with an oil sun holiday
2095 2018-01-04 21:07:09 Nah
2096 2018-01-04 21:07:07 A theory gathering lots of traction in anti-Kabila circles: France & Spain are deliberately blocking the EU from coming out hard vs Kabila regime, doing so in the interests of the Spanish companies which want the Inga Dam contract & Total which has oil permit in the east.
2097 2018-01-04 21:07:03 We are going to have so much oil that we can just go to the beach with a bucket and pick some up!
2098 2018-01-04 21:07:02 I'm fine with it. @POTUS can federally deregulate our coastlines, so long as states & local governments get final say. #statesrights #Oil has to compete with #CleanEnergy in the #marketplace, so good luck. Just don't use my tax dollars to support last century's energy resource.
2099 2018-01-04 21:06:59 Kiss it goodbye. If the oil industry wants it, they get it. We know who owns this country.
2100 2018-01-04 21:06:49 Lovely, The Trump administration Thursday announced plans to roll back a ban on new offshore drilling off the coasts of Florida and California and is considering more than 40 sites for leasing of natural gas and oil production. Another sad day for our environment!!!
2101 2018-01-04 21:06:48 I’m enjoying the money I have made, not my expertise my interest. Go and fight with someone else , enjoyed your recent spat with another , the three stooges were given a hiding I saw 
2102 2018-01-04 21:06:48 Just think of all the jobs created after a massive oil spill, with the clean up work.
2103 2018-01-04 21:06:46 Abhorrent! Even the governors font want it, so he must just be heeding the wants of big oil business. He must be stopped!!
2104 2018-01-04 21:06:46 #WTI  1st lot short @ 61.91 haven't traded oil for a while but offered up intraday double top with nice tight risk v potential reward
2105 2018-01-04 21:06:45 Why are so many Republicans backing Gov Rick Scott for a Senate seat in Florida? He's against building the wall, ending DACA, and more drilling for oil. Is it an Achems razor thing where he's popular in a FLA and he's better than incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson?
2106 2018-01-04 21:06:33 whats your washing routine? if youre drying your face out too much that can make your skin more susceptible to minor infections. i follow up washing w/ a very-low-but-not-zero-oil moisturizer since my skin is average to dry
2107 2018-01-04 21:06:24 while the whole world innovates to new energy sources, #trump invests in oil #economy. This will put #US many years behind in transitioning to a newconomy. #Renewables are getting cheaper then oil. Wake up!
2108 2018-01-04 21:06:21 We need more& bigger coalitions to curb the greed of Big Oil oligarchs & their bribing of corrupt govt officials. Corporations that grab resources from Earth (which technically belong to all Earthlings) should give back much bigger portions of profits for the benefit of society.
2109 2018-01-04 21:06:16 *Lifts head from my most recent copy of the Lancet*

How many hard questions did Nigeria answer from 2015 till date?

Admin & Econ Restructuring?
Political reform?
Health Sector reform?
Police reform?
Fuel Subsidy reform?
Oil block allocation & petroleum industry reform?
2110 2018-01-04 21:06:14 Gshit tho lol V-day if I’m not at a hotel wit some baby oil and someone’s daughter, then I’ve failed
2111 2018-01-04 21:06:12 Might as well ask them to stop exporting oil and keep it here for energy independance. That would mean a profit drop for trumpys pals
2112 2018-01-04 21:06:10 Try producing something other than oil?
2113 2018-01-04 21:06:05 I've seen David Blain perform this trick. 
Will that be basis of lawsuit?
2114 2018-01-04 21:05:57 Gasoline smells great to me, do I have an oil and gas problem?
2115 2018-01-04 21:05:53 Essential oil diffusers need to be in all public places because I’m anxious as hell but it smells great in here
2116 2018-01-04 21:05:52 Coconut oil is not good for the face but I mean whatever floats your boat 
2117 2018-01-04 21:05:42 I'm positive too, but the Nigerian elite businessmen have always had a way of punishing us so they can keep making money, there is a tale of generator importers VS constant power supply, oil marketers vs oil availability, dangote and co VS cement consumers.....
2118 2018-01-04 21:05:40 This drilling will lead to more traffic at LAX and we will all have to be in line longer and probably pay higher parking fees bc of all the drilling workers. Anyone who drills or uses oil is anti earth and should go to hell. Thanks a lot trump!
2119 2018-01-04 21:05:38 @latimes You forgot to ban or even clean up Fukushima: however, re oil, agree totally. Where do I donate?
2120 2018-01-04 21:05:21 @bob_oil Great minds think alike :-)
2121 2018-01-04 21:05:19 Statistics proves it.  The analysis on oil leaks in lakes, underground water reservoir, and rivers/streams are conclusive. The gulf of Mexico is still spilling. Pr. Williams in Alaska still has little life after 25 yr.  Why don't WE care for what God has made us gardeners of..
2122 2018-01-04 21:05:15 Oh we are dabbing now. I like this. Depending on how decent the glass is you should be able to heat it up slightly and try to drip the oil out of it
2123 2018-01-04 21:05:10 @kirstiepoole21 hey sweets. I saw your comment about the oil that helped with IC. Do you have the link for it? As I can’t find it x
2124 2018-01-04 21:05:05 Put the well head where SCUBA divers can reach it .. NOT 5000 feet underwater so it can gush oil for a year! #StupidLiberals
2125 2018-01-04 21:05:02 we used to have pirate radio stations offshore why not a TV station, plenty redundant oil boats around going cheap
2126 2018-01-04 21:05:02 Er, the crude oil comes by boat too, only bigger boats. Whether we refine it here from imported crude, or import refined product, sea lane denial will block the supply.
2127 2018-01-04 21:04:55 Oil drilling off coast of Florida puts our economy, environment & marine life at risk.  That’s why I’ve long opposed drilling off our coast & have been working closely with my Florida colleagues on both sides of aisle to extend prohibition on drilling off the coast of Florida.
2128 2018-01-04 21:04:52 Stop acting like a baby who has spilled his milk on that note better to block you , I#you should be congratulating me in being successful. Blocked, won’t lose any sleep with your expertise or lack of it.peace out
2129 2018-01-04 21:04:52 Nigerian Equity market surged further up today with the banking boosting the market performance. Likewise Forte Oil gained 5% today after more than 2 weeks stagnation.
2130 2018-01-04 21:04:43 The most odd aweful day after a nice birthday - ripped oil sump, hours waiting for it to be fixed, hours driving in horrid conditions and detours as the M6 gets closed... but it all fades after getting home to the news that my sister is in labour. (not politics btw) #push
2131 2018-01-04 21:04:36 You are wasting your time with the troll..he does not trade..if you ask him what he traded to get to the target..he will have no clue, By the way his expertise is blockchain and AI now if you read his profile:)
2132 2018-01-04 21:04:20 Driving my Civic after a oil change feels like a thing of beauty.
2133 2018-01-04 21:04:08 trust the oil of the future 
2134 2018-01-04 21:03:57 Alberta had 18% growth in 2014-2015?
Btw I'm thinking Calgary's office towers were heavily filled with oil and gas types. The rest of the province is leading the g7 in economically.
2135 2018-01-04 21:03:55 i know that with universal basic income, thousands of us citizens could choose education over enlisting in the military.

children sign up to die to protect big oil/diefense corporations best interests - in order to escape the vicious cycle of poverty

our people deserve better
2136 2018-01-04 21:03:54 Good lookin out, friend
2137 2018-01-04 21:03:50 I hate the feeling of oil in my hair but I love how amazing my hair feels after I wash it out
2138 2018-01-04 21:03:49 Just seen an ad in a sex site on here asking how many times a day you masturbate ? Considering I have one arm like Popeye and the other like Olive Oil, that’s not going to take much working out is it 
2139 2018-01-04 21:03:48 Oil is bad he says, as he drives off his SUV...
2140 2018-01-04 21:03:41 YOUR ON TARGET TEACH! LOTS OF YOUNG MEN WILL LOSE BECAUSE OF THE PIE IN THE SKY SNAKE OIL BITCOIN SALE. THE ENEMIES OF AMERICA HAVE PUMPED UP THE BITCOIN SALE!
2141 2018-01-04 21:03:37 CAF stops club sponsors such as @Vodacom and Engen, but they have Total and aiteo- gas and oil players. Double standards!
2142 2018-01-04 21:03:34 ive been having the same looping thought since i woke up this morning it's driving me crazy that i can't remember - it's "i want to get a beer after work, wait i can't i have to change the oil in my car, oh wait i can't do that until i get paid, nvm i can get a beer"
2143 2018-01-04 21:03:33 Here's another childish saying Trump should make, "Last one with the oil wins!"  
2144 2018-01-04 21:03:33 NOTE TO SELF. Don't drink chili oil, ever again.
2145 2018-01-04 21:03:26 when i make nasi goreng everything is fine until i add the egg/soy/sesame oil mix and idk what i'm doing wrong
2146 2018-01-04 21:03:24 it is the people who still buy oil that promote that. but clean engerny is way better and they now it .... # idiot's xoxo
2147 2018-01-04 21:03:23 RT ASX: #ASX200. Yesterday's biggest risers were OIL SEARCH $OSH, up 3.60%, BEACH $BPT, up 3.50% & SIMS METAL $SGM, up 3.09%. #ASXTop3.
2148 2018-01-04 21:03:22 GOP: "America first"

Also GOP: "Today we're going to compromise our ties with an anti-terrorism ally, expand oil and gas exploration while the rest of the world invests in clean energy, and reauthorize attacks on an industry that would contribute billions to our GDP"
2149 2018-01-04 21:03:13 I really really love the lipsome softener, the floral water cream, the liposome cream, the camellia body oil, the body lotion..shit I could go on and on.
2150 2018-01-04 21:03:11 Right up until there is a big oil spill.  And then not so much...
2151 2018-01-04 21:03:08 Don't forget cous-cous and mash potato powder... mixed with instant soup, e. g. tomato or mushrooms, super quick meal... for extra calories add bit of olive oil and maybe salami...
2152 2018-01-04 21:02:57 This is not something to be celebrated. While currently a major weather event is causing major flooding along our coastline. Stop looking in the rear view mirror to make your driving decisions. The future is not drilling for oil in important environmental locations.
2153 2018-01-04 21:02:56 Beard oil..what is that sir?  (Use castor and coconut oils)
2154 2018-01-04 21:02:56 When we're not committing property crimes, we're pumping oil.

Sincerely,

New Mexico
2155 2018-01-04 21:02:55 Still much, much better than running on oil.
2156 2018-01-04 21:02:37 One trillion dollar wealth fund+income from oil that provide Norwegians a carefree lifestyle and the leftie softards are asking for diversity
2157 2018-01-04 21:02:34 At the expense of more earth quakes, sea life dying, and major accidents AKA deep water horizon, or the BP oil spill in the gulf. Clearly your memory and history has not served you well
2158 2018-01-04 21:02:31 damn Kamy i guess you Dems would get upset if America could cut down on that 3.26 million barrels per day of oil we import that's sad Kamy
2159 2018-01-04 21:02:30 They're literally just dismantling all things Obama&placing the safety of Americans at risk,changes 2 fracking,oil&mining regs,reducing gov't agencies who enforce public safety,retirement home fines,even birds ffsakes,any person w/a brain should be concerned bc every1 is affected
2160 2018-01-04 21:02:28 peppermint oil has really helped my skin A LOT.
2161 2018-01-04 21:02:28 The Trump administration will allow new offshore oil and gas drilling in  most U.S. waters, opening access to more than 100 million acres.
2162 2018-01-04 21:02:27 YOU
    ARE
    THE
FUTURE’S
     OIL
2163 2018-01-04 21:02:21 Do you think epilepsy and seizure disorders are fake? Pharmaceuticals can’t stop my seizures, cannabis CBD oil can. Why do you not care about your fellow humans? Why should we suffer at your cruel and heartless hand? Do some research, don’t just follow Trump blindly.
2164 2018-01-04 21:02:13 Do we get oil from other countries? If so, maybe we do need it. Just guessing
2165 2018-01-04 21:02:11 chesus crise ya gotta give it time to grow properly ffssss, gon get some beard oil and shea moisture and live my best life
2166 2018-01-04 21:01:56 The first question should have been "do you take $$ from Tides and other US oil interests".
2167 2018-01-04 21:01:55 Guess that if ever you discover the business model of VPS/Cloud is anything but juicy snake oil you are gonna stop it?
Ooops.
Guess not. no one kills the golden goose.
So expecting an answeer that may look a little like intel PR/smoke screen.
2168 2018-01-04 21:01:53 anything with coconut oil is magical for my hair/skin.
2169 2018-01-04 21:01:41 Nor is there any good reason to allow oil drilling off Florida coast.
2170 2018-01-04 21:01:39 I reall hope what I heard about Jeff Sessions today on the radio was FAKE NEWS! So much progress was made, I mean look at the history of the politics behind the illegalization of Marijuana. This is an Herb with multiple applications, oil, hemp fiber, paper, all bio friendly!
2171 2018-01-04 21:01:35 dude i wanna like, bathe in sesame oil
2172 2018-01-04 21:01:24 Trump and Zinke allowing oil exploration completely around the USA is being do just to make your rich oil firms richer. Go Solar and Wind. Get smart.
2173 2018-01-04 21:01:20 I coated the skin with olive oil and cracked salt and pepper- so good!
2174 2018-01-04 21:01:19 I hit the button to see the back haha
2175 2018-01-04 21:01:17 And by the way Obama took credit for increased oil production during his time even though he did everything to thwart domestic oil production, and really I can't recall CNBC challenging him on that
2176 2018-01-04 21:01:07 Changing your air filter keeps the air your car 'breathes' clean, have it checked & changed at your next oil change.
2177 2018-01-04 21:01:06 How's that Jill Stein vote working out for you, @SusanSarandon? Today:
1.) Crack down on legal pot
2.) Sour relationships with a key ally
3.) Open more shoreline to oil and gas drilling

2181 2018-01-04 21:00:54 I hope that Muller acts quickly enough to rid us of fuck face so that some of America remains pristine. Drilling for oil is only for rich people to profit whereas solar energy is a way to preserve the future for our children.#BlueWave2018

2183 2018-01-04 21:00:48 Exactly Dan.
My oil change just now is up $6 from last time “due to the Min Wage Hike”.
We all told them, we all knew price hikes would trickle through, but they didn’t listen, they knew better....
2184 2018-01-04 21:00:48 BITCOIN IS A HELL NO BUY! I HAVE THE STOMACH TO RIDE TEXAS/ AMERICAN  OIL! REMEMBER IT'S GOD MADE & BITCOIN IS MANMADE SNAKE OIL!
2185 2018-01-04 21:00:43 IMHO, there is already a plan in place for China to contain/depose Kim, in exchange for control of S. China Sea oil.
2186 2018-01-04 21:00:39 OIL DIFF: 6.36 -> 6.39
2187 2018-01-04 21:00:37 @FPS_oil & @SutherlandTable, are you having a laugh.... Oil cheaper than NG??? 
2188 2018-01-04 21:00:33 Until such time as the whole world goes green, there will be a need for this.  Before you throw stones ask yourself if you're a consumer of oil.
2189 2018-01-04 21:00:30 So deep-seated is their disdain for my university degree that they smear my books with palm oil and hide them under the kitchen cupboards.

2190 2018-01-04 21:00:23 We are doing fine in Texas. Why should oil drilling be only I Gulf of Mexico?
2191 2018-01-04 21:00:18 Says the #Moron who has crippled the @StateDept by turning it into Big Oil's Access to Foreign Affairs... 

The same #Moron who has turned the @EPA into the Big Oil "Regulatory" Commission by removing Scientists & Science who are factually correct, however, disagree with Agenda..
2192 2018-01-04 21:00:16 Shutting down illegal immigration is first priority and main focus. Illegal aliens opinions don't matter.

Eia

Us oil export
2194 2018-01-04 21:00:14 It would be a waste of money for any oil company to start a new drilling operation. After November we will shut it down.
2195 2018-01-04 21:00:08 Yep...my sons first job...was doing well last q of 16...17 was really slow...”18” he started his own business...CBD oil products on line and on foot! No need for a car
2196 2018-01-04 21:00:02 Thermodynamics, physics and biology combined to make fossil fuels. Oil is super concentrated solar and wind energy. Hard to match the energy content of oil. Nuclear is the way to go. It’s like having a mini sun here on earth.
2197 2018-01-04 21:00:00 #ASX200. Yesterday's biggest risers were OIL SEARCH $OSH, up 3.60%, BEACH $BPT, up 3.50% & SIMS METAL $SGM, up 3.09%. #ASXTop3.
2198 2018-01-04 20:59:58 But wait this oil price BANGING these days tho.... #JobsSoonCome
2199 2018-01-04 20:59:54 Oil independence from foreign countries is the biggest step we the people demand! Thank you POTUS
2200 2018-01-04 20:59:51 @SenateGOP - Because, investments are in alcohol, tobacco/vaping, Big PHARMA opioid's/over prescribing, junk food/drink/GMO's/pesticides/hormones, Big Oil, etc.. Those all kill and drive up health care costs. Those are all legal! More dangerous than natural 420! Gov wants CONTROL
2201 2018-01-04 20:59:46 Again, quacks will be exposed soon enough. You're no different than the gold lunatics in 2010 and early 2011. You may have made some money, but it's not because of any good knowledge of oil. Your EIA claim was wrong.
2202 2018-01-04 20:59:10 Not so good news for the sea life and the environment. But who cares as long as the oil corporations get richer and richer? Disgusting.
2203 2018-01-04 20:59:09 And that Foster/Rogers United Oil Products building, extensible, also demolished. (2/2)
2204 2018-01-04 20:59:02 FYI. Hotels in Santa Barbara toiletries include wipes to remove oil after visiting the beach. The most beautiful beaches in the country are being destroyed. When will it be enough?
2205 2018-01-04 20:59:00 I'm sure there's been a coup somewhere on earth where the @CIA wasn't involved. But a nation with oil reserves? No. Way.
2206 2018-01-04 20:59:00 Any drunken monkey could have ran a government when oil prices were over $100/barrel like Klein.  That being said, they spend very little money on infrastructure instead giving the rich breaks were ever possible.  NDP are in a no win situation to what they took over from PC's
2207 2018-01-04 20:58:57 I hear ya! I’m extremely fond of warm baths with body oil and an oatmeal/camomile cache.
2208 2018-01-04 20:58:52 You do realize that because we have a glut of cheap oil that he just did absolutely nothing, right? Or are you too busy "winning" to know what's going on in reality?
2209 2018-01-04 20:58:44 Cute!
2210 2018-01-04 20:58:33 Brain dead = perfect description!
2211 2018-01-04 20:58:28 Oil of Olay all day everyday
2212 2018-01-04 20:58:16 Not my finest idea: eating noodles with chili oil while trying to read my entire book out loud. Owww my throat.
2213 2018-01-04 20:58:15 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
2214 2018-01-04 20:58:15 i’m getting an oil change and this dude just asked to change my air filter. bruh it’s January, I can just let the windows down
2215 2018-01-04 20:58:14 The #world goes #renewable and #DonaldTrump goes #neolithic #great #choice #thebestchoiceever ... #not #oil
2216 2018-01-04 20:58:02 Cream -> Palm Kernel Oil
Price -> Less than 1min Phone call to someone in the village or check the local market around your location...  
Ps: I'm serious!
2217 2018-01-04 20:58:00 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
2218 2018-01-04 20:57:57 Speak out against Trump-a-dump's plan to open the #Oceans and the #Arctic to offshore drilling. Keep what is left of #MotherEarth clean and allow wildlife to thrive. We neither need or want oil pollution in our air, water and soil. Call, write or protest your views.
2219 2018-01-04 20:57:56 Emely let her oil go so low you can even see it on the dip stick. Dad is about to return to sender RIP to emely
2220 2018-01-04 20:57:53 Block this.  There is no need for this in a global oil glut.
2221 2018-01-04 20:57:48 You would think that. But I live on the coast so don't agree with it at all. I want sea life to live in clean water. I want my coast line free from oil spills. Let's look at alternate sources of energy besides oil.
2222 2018-01-04 20:57:44 Put some olive oil and oregano on that!!
2223 2018-01-04 20:57:35 I remember going to the beach in Santa Barbara and the oil all over the sand...
2224 2018-01-04 20:57:35 And why in hell he's comparing SA with US That's simply a noon-since my friend I pay nearly 100$ a month for electricity with central Ac as cooler/heater electric oven and all as for gas its per gallon (2.5 liters) yet its varies from oil producing state to another
2225 2018-01-04 20:57:31 #US to cut funds to #UN & #Palestine. & they want to whine about it?

Haven't they heard, "don't bite the hand that feeds you"?

What they could do is stop selling oil for dollars, & sell for only currency backed by gold. Isn't that what the #Sharia allows?

Then see how much
2226 2018-01-04 20:57:27  very annoyed when someone asks for veterinary advice on Facebook and someone always comments. Coconut oil. No friends, there are no confirmed benefits of giving your dog coconut oil.
2227 2018-01-04 20:57:25 Why do govts grant Big Oil permission to extract natural resources from the Earth for mere pennies?! Technically, the Earth's resources belong to ALL EARTHLINGS. Fossil fuel corporations should share a much greater portion of their profits with society: improving environment, etc
2228 2018-01-04 20:57:24 Why will it?? What is in it for China. If Pakistan was an oil producing nation there would be something in it for China. China is only concerned about economic interests.
2229 2018-01-04 20:57:22 ‘everyone knows they’re going for oil and that there. that’s why they stick their snouts in’ - my grandpa on war
2230 2018-01-04 20:57:16 Yes she is! And I completely agree. Maybe the sea salt but defs not olive oil lol
2231 2018-01-04 20:57:15 Unnecesary regulations such as:
Opiod crisis but Jeff Sessions rescinding the policy on legal marijuana? 
GOM oil spill, but Ryan Zinke rolling back the ban on new offshore drilling off the coasts of Florida and California etc.??
Like these?? Yep...solid 'plans' indeed dopey!
2232 2018-01-04 20:57:13 Being against oil drilling is fine, I get it. But that is a poor argument against it.
2233 2018-01-04 20:57:07 Tire gets a nail in it. Cool, I go to the shop to get it patched. Starter goes out while I’m there. Okaaay that’s wassup I’ll pay to get it replaced. Starter gives out because the oil thingy is dripping on it which also has to get replaced. BET
2234 2018-01-04 20:57:00 Islamic regime of Iran is using the oil money you are paying to broadcast terrorism and hatred in you countries.
Stop buying oil and #BanIRIB
2235 2018-01-04 20:56:58 You clearly can not read my target has been surpassed I have enjoyed that trade, might join you, glad I did not listen to you last year would not have made anything. Brilliant how I have come out of this well from just reading a few headlines  anyway cheers 
2236 2018-01-04 20:56:58 So Jeff Sessions, you want children and adults alike to suffer with epileptic seizures the rest of their lives? Instead of taking nonphycoactive CBD cannabis oil that relieves seizures in a matter of mins. So they can have a life and function in society?
2237 2018-01-04 20:56:53 By the time you look back and wonder "when did they build that oil well in the park" or "when did they elect that racist judge" its too late and it'll take 100x the effort to undo the damage.
2238 2018-01-04 20:56:51 Ahh feels good to have my natural curly hair back. Currently sat with deep conditioner, castor oil and honey in my hair 
2239 2018-01-04 20:56:50 Same
2240 2018-01-04 20:56:41 That's why this move is just hrandstanding. He wants to show his idiot voters "see how I'm fixing all the things Obama wouldn't let you do" while not actually doing anything. Oil Co aren't going to spend a bunch of $ to start new drilling right now or any time soon.
2241 2018-01-04 20:56:39 Greg Burke knows Jack shite. He could of and should have sold at 31p and made a Motza instead of whingeing about me at every opportunity. Growth by acquisition was always the intention as the oil/gas market softened and hence why we I got us into earthmoving and coal.
2242 2018-01-04 20:56:27 But during GEJ oil was steady why now?
2243 2018-01-04 20:56:26 What a great looking kitty...
2244 2018-01-04 20:56:23 New oil discoveries under Trump Tower. Drill baby drill.
2245 2018-01-04 20:56:18 I love that we have someone named Rex Tillerson in the Administration.....if we need OIL  a T-REX (hey, I read hebrew right to left) is someone that will let us dig deep
2246 2018-01-04 20:56:18 Unrestrained oil and gas drilling coupled with the EPA regulatory rollbacks under Pruitt is a recipe for a disaster in the making!!
2247 2018-01-04 20:56:14 Haha! Just keep oil away from your eyes. There are lash extension washes on Amazon or you can use baby shampoo. Trick is to focus the cleanser on your lids and then let it gently wash down your lashes when you rinse.
2248 2018-01-04 20:56:14 My son was at UCSB. Walk on the beach any day and you will see drops of crude oil from the existing derricks. And they want to expand that?
2249 2018-01-04 20:56:11 TRUMPS oil buddies need to make more money and kill the earth!
2250 2018-01-04 20:56:11 nyx butter gloss or milani moisture lock oil treatment :)
2251 2018-01-04 20:56:09 Alanya’nın ortasındaki Kleopatra plajının ortasına kanalizasyon döşeyip, kanalizasyondan fuel oil akmış diye şaşır, bu kanaldan yaz kış ne akıyor?  Hayat pınarı mı? Kanalda  hangi hayvanlar yaşıyor?  Niye kimseye garip gelmiyor plajın ortasındaki bu kanal?
2252 2018-01-04 20:56:09 Eat a spoonful of coconut oil everyday
2253 2018-01-04 20:56:03 So we can have Deep Water Horizon Oil Spills Everywhere!!
2254 2018-01-04 20:55:58 If the PC govt properly governed when Oil prices were $80+ for all those years they were in power we wouldn't be having this discussion because our heritage fund would be worth billions and could have used it in tough times like now when oil has been so low. 1/2
2255 2018-01-04 20:55:57 Cooking dinner for my brother and future sister-in-law. Thought I'd have a quick jaunt to the store. Nope. 

Checked the pantry - I was out of salt, pepper, and oil. *deep sigh* *wallet screams*
2256 2018-01-04 20:55:52 Hi! Greetings from Kalamazoo! Do all of your beard oils contain nut oils?  I have a nut allergy and am looking for a new oil without almond or coconut! @detroitgrooming
2257 2018-01-04 20:55:47 lol man get off the pipe ND and FSU are a hell of a lot better program ... If it wasn't for oil money y'all wouldn't be making these hires , thats a fact
2258 2018-01-04 20:55:44 We could be energy independent if we stop selling outside of us for a profit.. oil companies that are getting these contracts are global companies
2259 2018-01-04 20:55:44 Men are getting hipped to the Wild Growth oil 
2260 2018-01-04 20:55:43 according to Doc..you want him to last till a new year.. because he's drilling for crude oil..let them tap your gf.. we'll see your reaction
2261 2018-01-04 20:55:39 Best part of having freshly done and styled dreads is having someone to oil your scalp... shits like sex, or Q-tips in your ear...
2262 2018-01-04 20:55:16 Peppermint oil helps me.
2263 2018-01-04 20:55:08 The oil companies are now saying that the @NYC_DOT is not allowing them on the road. Please help!
2264 2018-01-04 20:54:56 Hot air popped popcorn is not as good as oil popped popcorn. 
2265 2018-01-04 20:54:53 The key to a clear face......
Coconut oil, water and pineapple waterTHOSE ARE MY BESTFRIENDS RIGHT THERE.
2266 2018-01-04 20:54:51 So what happens when demand for oil dissipates. Believe me you blame the UK... well the UK is desperate to transition away from oil. So what will happen to the region already trapped in poverty when demand drops.
2267 2018-01-04 20:54:38 @mallypallyy you can also mix eucalyptus oil with like corn starch or something and put them in the bottom of your shower and it releases while your shower with the steam 
2268 2018-01-04 20:54:37 A big chunk of coastal CA gets income from tourism, too. Who TF from another country wants to see oil rigs instead of whales?
2269 2018-01-04 20:54:34 It is a DISASTER!!  We have plenty of oil!!
2270 2018-01-04 20:54:23 How much $$ to place some big beautiful oil rigs just off shore of mar a lago?
2271 2018-01-04 20:54:22 "So much for the states' rights ballyhoo the Republicans sell like snake oil"
2272 2018-01-04 20:54:16 Pre-emption. Mobil vs State Oil and Gas Board of Mississippi
2273 2018-01-04 20:54:14 Es que sí ayuda bro! Investiga sobre el CBD oil... a mi me tiró un súper paro con mi fractura de tobillo. Y ya es legal en México por qué es lo medicinal de la planta, sin THC que es lo que pone High
2274 2018-01-04 20:54:13 You gotta be talking about the Clinton’s “pay to play” games. I rather have America producing gas, oil, and coal than having it shipped and destroying our oceans!
2275 2018-01-04 20:54:10 Let’s resist changing the subject. Can we spend a moment to discuss our Coastal Waters being auctioned off to oil companies? This will have very negative environmental repercussions. What are the economic repercussions? How is this even legal?
2276 2018-01-04 20:54:08 Keep trying for the rest of the year. Let's see how 2018 goes for you. It won't be pretty for you I can tell you that. I wonder what's your next bullish thesis is? "Oil will rise because Iran". Be prepared for 2018 :)
2277 2018-01-04 20:54:07 Well, not only..... The goal is to make the oil companies richer so that they will continue to support Fat Donny & make him richer. never mind about the cost to environment/sea life, Donny don't cate because he'll won't be around when his shit comes home to roost
2278 2018-01-04 20:54:06 One of them needs an oil change :-)
2279 2018-01-04 20:54:02 Need some oil rigs right outside Par-a-Lago .....
2280 2018-01-04 20:54:01 I now have coconut oil in almost every room in my house... Adulting Level = Expert?
2281 2018-01-04 20:54:01 Oooh you’re so smart :> I do have olbas oil xxx I shall use  I hope you’re okay my love xxxxx 
2282 2018-01-04 20:53:52 They'll never take it away. Doesn't take too much to grow marijuana; just throw some seeds out there. Drugs don't come any natural than that. We know who lines the Politicians pockets: Big Pharma, Insurance Companies and Big Oil. Money talks, bullshit walks.
2283 2018-01-04 20:53:48 So drained and changed the gas and oil and put in a new spark plug in this stupid snowblower and it still doesn’t want to start 
2284 2018-01-04 20:53:46 I received a lip oil from Ulta and boi are my lips feeling nice
2285 2018-01-04 20:53:44 I got this oil vape thing. Im@not really fuckin with it.
2286 2018-01-04 20:53:35 No problem showering you.
I've got a 50ml bottle of "special" oil too that someone just sold me for a fiver.
2287 2018-01-04 20:53:33 More oil spills and a.continuation of taking the environment apart...
good for your kids huh
2288 2018-01-04 20:53:31 No jokes about my state.  We Oregonians don't trust in self serve or sales taxes.  We trust in peace, pot, patchouli oil... and Prefontaine.
2289 2018-01-04 20:53:22 Breitbart does a lot of good work. They don't need this crap. Andrew would not be happy.
2290 2018-01-04 20:53:13 Not a huge fan of the Wressle project, but with current oil prices it makes a bit more sense now. Really waiting on the big news from Malaysia - Zakaria has 120m shares (about 31% of all stock). Looking at his (and Bolhassan's) Sarawak contacts, there must be a bigger plan! #UPL
2291 2018-01-04 20:53:11 #vanpoli If you think that picture is -30 degree weather then you've never experienced -30 degree weather.   Of course they do have oil money to pay for such things.
2292 2018-01-04 20:53:06 We still have dead zones, lost industry, and illness from the BP Oil spill. I hope Congress can help us avoid more damage.
2293 2018-01-04 20:52:58 Interested in my SACRED healing services : TAROT / Oracle Readings . Yoni Steams Aura Cleanses crystal pendant. Sensual Attraction oil-- Rose Water Spray 
2294 2018-01-04 20:52:52 You are all taking us backward - to a polluting form of energy we must transition away from. Oil kills our health, environment and the planet. KEEP IT IN THE GROUND. The American people do not want this! You are the height of GREED! You are IDIOTS!
2295 2018-01-04 20:52:46 Get the olive oil one.
2296 2018-01-04 20:52:36 All it does is as stock value to the oil companies.
2297 2018-01-04 20:52:30 me I am midnight oil
2298 2018-01-04 20:52:30 Please help stop this! Oil and gas are not the future. I could cry it’s so upsetting.
2299 2018-01-04 20:52:29 What about the soon to be oil spills and drop in beach tourism?  Thank him about that yet?  Ass kisser - hopefully you will be voted out next time around.
2300 2018-01-04 20:52:26 WTF!!!! Move!! Move house now!!! Grab ur hand bag, cover the place in cooking oil & bern it! Bern it to the fucking ground! Fuck scorpions hell no 
2301 2018-01-04 20:52:24 The same lesson you and all of #OOTT will learn this 2018 year. I will not let quacks keep their sense of expertise after this speculation is over. And your expectations were basically just "OPEC and shale want it". You're not different then other frauds like Peter Schiff.
2302 2018-01-04 20:52:22 Will you ignore comments that don't support your oil and gas agenda? That's what you did when it came to the monument review.
2303 2018-01-04 20:52:16 There goes the planet, if there was any doubt.
The Trump administration will allow new offshore oil and gas drilling in most U.S. waters, opening access to more than 100 million acres
2304 2018-01-04 20:52:10 well I must say that all of our products smells good, but we’re specifically made for the complex skin types. There is a lot for you to try from deodorant, to rosehip oil for your face, and OMG Soap 
2305 2018-01-04 20:52:10 Usually squeaky wheels get the oil. Why all the screeching? What’s there to lose? Millions already wasted on another witch hunt.
2306 2018-01-04 20:52:09 I love them too ;-; try warm or less time in hot water. And slather on body oil right after while you're still damp
2307 2018-01-04 20:52:04 its days like these I need an oil pen
2308 2018-01-04 20:52:01 I get my oil change next door so now I’m definitely trying that place.
2309 2018-01-04 20:52:01 Why though? Oil companies aren't even drilling in the places they already have leases for.
2310 2018-01-04 20:51:53 And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.
Isaiah:30:21

@obyezeks May the Lord give you sufficient Oil  in your Lamp  as lead the charge for a New 
2311 2018-01-04 20:51:48 Let me see if I understand Trump's logic.

Windmills are ugly and detract from the natural beauty of the ocean with no risk of ecological devastation.

Oil derricks are just fine.

Got it.
2312 2018-01-04 20:51:38 Oil got to my target who cares lol

2315 2018-01-04 20:51:35 It means more deep water horizon incidents, and less oil in the ground where it will be needed by future generations incase of massive solar flare.

2316 2018-01-04 20:51:30 Per yesterday's stock market report, oil is priced at $61 per barrel. That low price means the US is awash with oil. Having more oil produced would result in more being sold on the international markets, profiting the big oil companies.
2317 2018-01-04 20:51:24 Oh man, you are so last century! Hopefully the economics aren’t there to do it. There’s so much more promise to the planet and economy in alternative energy sources. Fingers crossed we don’t pollute our oceans figuring that out. Quit incentives for oil cos.
2318 2018-01-04 20:51:20 I have this clove oil medicine in my mouth to numb my gums cause in pain from the wisdom tooth and let me tell ya, it’s disgusting

2320 2018-01-04 20:51:14 I CALLED PAUL NOBODY ANSWERED DAMMIT. GO OIL THE WHEELS ON YOUR WALKER
2321 2018-01-04 20:51:12 Let’s propose erecting of oil derrick offshore of Mar-a-Lago
2322 2018-01-04 20:51:12 What needs to be done is a rescheduling of present marijuana laws. Reschedule it from 1 to 3. If you witness what cannibus oil does to bring a child's constant seizures under control and as soon as your eyes clear your scepticism must instantly clear. It's a moving feeling.
2323 2018-01-04 20:51:07 Went to get an oil change.. they asked me to pop my hood... I couldn’t even figure out where the  hood release was.. why the fuck am I even an adult. 
2324 2018-01-04 20:50:42 Offshore oil drilling ban lifted
2325 2018-01-04 20:50:32 You are unable to read, I said oil surpassed my expectations I’m happy. Stay within your group I have seen your spats and you should learn your lesson
2326 2018-01-04 20:50:32 Too much lithium in Afghanistan to leave.  Thats my opinion anyway.  For decades, we were there “fighting terrorism” but really just about oil.   Afghanistan is rich in nat gas, lithium and most importantly, opium.  “The war on terror” and “war on drugs” = $$$$$$$$$$
2327 2018-01-04 20:50:28 April, our Gulf Coast (south of Mobile and MS) is still dead from the BP oil spill. We have lost jobs in fishing and tourism. There are still oil clumps washing ashore. People have been sick and died.  Hope journalists will cover this as Trump kills what's left.
2328 2018-01-04 20:50:23 Completely frazzled  tingle hemp cream on the sunbed was maybe a bit too much for my white ass! Stick to the oil next time!
2329 2018-01-04 20:50:21 If Trump and the Retrumplicans say that CO2 emissions are not harmful for the Environment - and Oil Drilling on Public Lands and Public Waters for Private Profit is good for members of Mara a Logo then we must trust them. Those Florida swamp creatures would never lie to us.
2330 2018-01-04 20:50:19 Why can't you be sued for defamation? You spout absolute bullshit on a daily basis. Nobody is buying your snake oil anymore Don
2331 2018-01-04 20:50:15 Many "burdensome" regs were put in place to save people's lives. A clean environment is a high priority since we all live in it. Answer my questions about how costly oil spills are. I'll add the cost of historic flooding to the q also.
2332 2018-01-04 20:50:12 Oil dynamics is a strange one. Clearly OPEC and it international conspirators will keep trying to feed our addiction which I think will see a downturn. Look Nigeria has suffered due to its reliance on oil. Does Nigeria have a future plan, probably not.
2333 2018-01-04 20:49:53 As far as the #miners and #oil shorts that I'm HEAVY on right now..... We are either at an inflection/trend change or the bulls are about to get a baptizing that's going to hurt some accounts..... Or.... It's a trend change and Silky gets baptized.... I still think it's not me
2334 2018-01-04 20:49:50 Do you like being giving ppl money for oil that hate our guts? Or do you want energy prices so high no one can afford it? Do you like your gas prices right now? Do you ride a horse to work right now?
2335 2018-01-04 20:49:35 And idiots think it will affect the price of oil. It will only make the rich richer.
2336 2018-01-04 20:49:34 If you read your link there...you'd see this is a lie. Example. Wells fargo is raising wages to $15 an hour...giving money to charity. 
You're a snake oil salesman and you've sold your soul.
2337 2018-01-04 20:49:32 DON'T USE "chemical dispersants" if there's an oil spill. CRUDE OIL is a natural product....the planet knows how to re-cycle it. Chemical Dispersants are not natural and are WORSE for the environment than the Oil Spill......
2338 2018-01-04 20:49:28 These ocean platforms are far too risky and destructive. The people who live on these ocean platforms do difficult dangerous work. Living in such an environment must be surreal. So many ocean drilling platforms. Oil spills are awful normally. The ocean ecosystem needs protectiom
2339 2018-01-04 20:49:27 i switched out cleaning my face at the end of the night w make up wipes and cleanser for tea tree oil and lavender oil. it's been awesome
2340 2018-01-04 20:49:25 A project that respects all safety practices and minimizes our oil dependency can only benefit all aspects of American society. #oilandgas #ordertocash
2341 2018-01-04 20:49:24 Again, more headline reading, and no real knowledge of oil. Why don't you give me the proper context behind those draws? And if you're going long based on "OMG GEOPOLITICS", then I'll be laughing my way to the bank come this year. Again, time exposes quacks.
2342 2018-01-04 20:49:12 Trump admin just announced that their draft 5-year oil & gas leasing plan allows drilling in parts of the Pacific. Californians do not want their coastal economies put at risk. As ranking member of Energy and Mineral Resources, I’m leading the fight against this misguided move.
2343 2018-01-04 20:49:06 OK , Sounds good! The fuel of the present is oil,In time it will change but technology has not really improved or brought machines better than internal combustion engines or steam engine!!!
2344 2018-01-04 20:49:02 I started my first oil painting today and I’ve inhaled so many fumes lmaooo
2345 2018-01-04 20:49:01 Plus renewable energy is getting better. That's more independent than oil, who is going to block out the sun? Same for wind, geothermal, wave, waste, and hydropower. We also urgently need an alternative to plastic, there's very little room for oil in the future.
2346 2018-01-04 20:49:00 水(ウォーター)とは仲が悪いです。
2347 2018-01-04 20:48:59 Trump opens our oceans to pollution and drilling. Whatever oil is there will soon be gone. Who has stakes in oil?
2348 2018-01-04 20:48:57 The ocean off Malibu would be the place to start.  Lots of oil just off the beach.
2349 2018-01-04 20:48:55 I also love 'give me oil in my lamp, keep me burning'...
2350 2018-01-04 20:48:55 Good! To get that American oil flowing!
2351 2018-01-04 20:48:50 New tires, oil changed, car washed and clean. Ready to hit the road!
2352 2018-01-04 20:48:48 * Trump administration proposes massive expansion of offshore oil drilling
* Plan would open 90% of offshore areas for drilling starting in 2019, up from 6% under previous plan #oil #br #CL_F #CL #BR
2353 2018-01-04 20:48:44 Please god just don't use coconut oil on your poor little face& neck. Love ya self & try something else. This has been a PSA
2354 2018-01-04 20:48:37 Question, what's the standing on motor oil, sweat and paperwork smell?
2355 2018-01-04 20:48:26 And didn’t the Cheeto just do away with the safety watchdog agency that helps prevent oil rig accidents like the Deep Water Horizon tragedy that killed 11 oil rig workers?
2356 2018-01-04 20:48:26 So basically @realDonaldTrump wants the government out of states unless he can profit from it.  This should be the states whose economies will be affected by all the oil spills.  Still recovering from the gulf oil spill 5 years later.
2357 2018-01-04 20:48:25 #EnergyIndependence not one drop of oil from the Middle East. Stop sending them our money.
2358 2018-01-04 20:48:25 Tame your headaches by rubbing peppermint oil like tiger balm to the temples.
2359 2018-01-04 20:48:21 Kate Mcgregor (Zinke’s asst) said, “We think it can be done safely.” That’s what they said about the oil pipelines and almost immediately there were spills. They care nothing about the environment.This cannot happen along the CA coast. What is wrong with them? 
2360 2018-01-04 20:48:20 I feel like a hippie now...just bought hella vitamin C, oil of oregano and lavender oil off Amazon...y’all can keep them pharmaceuticals 
2361 2018-01-04 20:48:10 That and Canadian barrels and higher production up there are trapped because of lack of pipeline takeaway capacity to Cushing/Gulf. Look at Canadian oil inventories, surging to new highs!
2362 2018-01-04 20:48:10 Gold can still stretch here up another 10-20pts while Oil too can see 62.5-63 as well as SPX can see another 20-30pts too. Must be some tough rubber-bands as theya re stretched but not breaking at all.
2363 2018-01-04 20:47:57 I'm a little scared to try the oil because you hear of the shit it's mixed with or made with
2364 2018-01-04 20:47:47 Hope it helps, manky feeling. Have you olbas oil? I put it in the bottom of the shower
2365 2018-01-04 20:47:40 Can’t wait till I get me a husband that can pay or actually do my oil change and other car necessities 
2366 2018-01-04 20:47:40 I think they just want to stop any revenue stream that will help America with the giant deficit they purposely created because they want Americans to be ok with lifting sanctions on Russia so they can get their share of the giant oil ocean Tillerson/Exxon found prior to election
2367 2018-01-04 20:47:30 Called our oil company to get an update on an oil delivery only to discover that whoever I waited two hours to speak with last night NEVER PUT OUR TICKET THROUGH. I SAID WE WERE OUT OF OIL AND HAD NO HEAT OR HOT WATER DURING A FUCKING BLIZZARD WITH A 3 YEAR OLD IN THE HOUSE.
2368 2018-01-04 20:47:30 Don’t hold your breath for these dudes to start caring about constituents. They only care about their oil & gas patrons.
2369 2018-01-04 20:47:20 lots more oil spilled into the ocean... Remember Deep Water Horizon? How silly we are to forget so soon.
2370 2018-01-04 20:47:15 There are nationalized oil industries in UK Saudi Arabia Brasil Venezuela Iran Iraq and many other places. Nationalization by it self doesn't fix the problems
2371 2018-01-04 20:47:09 My late boyfriend was a DEA agent. They don’t care about medicinal cannabis. When I got sick, he saw that there were patients suffering and CBD oil could help. He was more concerned about hardcore street drugs that were killing people.
2372 2018-01-04 20:47:04 I just need some new lip gloss, my hair did, my lashes did, my car washed, & my oil changed  I’ll feel so refreshed
2373 2018-01-04 20:47:02 3: The reasons WHY separate the people who actually know what they're talking about, and the people who read a Bloomberg or Reuters headline and think they're an expert based on that. 2018 isn't going to be kind to you. Time exposes quacks.
2374 2018-01-04 20:46:52 @NiaJaxWWE Nia I'm watching total Diva if you need a boyfriend Oil Davis  form wrestletalk Tv is still an option for you.
2375 2018-01-04 20:46:51 But Trumps already has Health Insurance !!! Why would he waste his time on something important for the People? There’s coal to be dug, oil to be drilled , safety regulations to ban, countries to start chaos in ,  the US govt to tear down!!! No time to help the People !!!!!!!!!!!!
2376 2018-01-04 20:46:44 1 in the 80s PV & Active #SOLAR was projected to become competitive with #FossilFuels #oil at $100/barrel. #Energy alternatives are approaching "system cost" parody due to rising cost of conventional #grid #electricity Do we call this breakthrough or stagnantion?
2377 2018-01-04 20:46:41 Actually they were , inventory draws number if months  and the opec, nopec cuts working.   Surpassed due to geopolitics , outraged and hurricanes.
2378 2018-01-04 20:46:40 Been driving two years now and I’ve still not put oil in my car my self my dad always does it cos I’m not trusted 
2379 2018-01-04 20:46:39 Good! So big oil co. don't need to drill more oil then.
2380 2018-01-04 20:46:37 Fuel is even more available than the oil inside condoms these days...
2381 2018-01-04 20:46:36 Slippery slope.  We are able to keep the prices down because of the cheap overseas oil.  The production cost is roughly 3X higher in America than in S.A.  Yes being less dependent is good but can lead to higher prices at the pump.
2382 2018-01-04 20:46:31 Brooke was laughing at me because I dropped olive oil on the sweater I'm wearing... but jokes on her because it's her sweater
2383 2018-01-04 20:46:30 You can grow and smoke marijuana but only if you’re on an offshore oil rig
2384 2018-01-04 20:46:29 Your mom doesn't think so
2385 2018-01-04 20:46:28 We don't need any Oil Rigs in Florida waters. Gulf of Mexico have abandoned oil rigs,...start there.
2386 2018-01-04 20:46:25 my car be demanding an oil change lol that mf don’t even ask anymore 
2387 2018-01-04 20:46:23 Sure, Paul, screw the environment as long as the needs of Big Oil, your donors, are met.  Way to go big guy!
2388 2018-01-04 20:46:20 I wrote eleven letters to the nice people willing to try my beard oil experiments ;)
2389 2018-01-04 20:46:17 Coconut oil is
2390 2018-01-04 20:46:15 Why ruin fisheries and tourism with dirty oil for energy when we need to go completely solar? Solar is 100% clean and always available. I know you like Duke pollution money, but come on.
2391 2018-01-04 20:46:12 It was legit just called Argan oil
2392 2018-01-04 20:46:07 oil got delivered, furnace got restarted. it's back up to about 62 in here now.
2393 2018-01-04 20:46:07 The thing about oil painting is you don’t have to buy LUTs but you do have to worry about color temperature , contrast, and composition 
2394 2018-01-04 20:46:02 見えない、聞こえない。
2395 2018-01-04 20:45:49 And almost 50 years later, the oil tar still washes ashore fouling the beaches...so...
2396 2018-01-04 20:45:49 I demand a big beautiful oil rig right off maralago.
2397 2018-01-04 20:45:45 Then all of a sudden, there’s 100s of flavors, baked goods, candy. In fact it should have only been dispensed as an oil. One more problem we will bare, just like the pain killer epidemic. In the end, the federal govt should have shut them down. The state should be the dispensary!
2398 2018-01-04 20:45:43 People died and that's what you care about? How economically expensive is every oil spill? The regs are in place now and gas costs less than $3 where I live.
2399 2018-01-04 20:45:43 "NEWS! Trump Announces Plan That Would Open Maine Waters to Oil Drilling, ME hearing slated." Just in from @NRCMenvironment. What abt. more #publictransport? Fewer #plastic bags? Turning #gas heat down at night? Let's cut our oil consumption before trampling on the #environment!!
2400 2018-01-04 20:45:40 おつありっぽい？
2401 2018-01-04 20:45:37 2: There were a ton of people who laughed at me back in 2011 when gold kept it's run. The reasons they kept claiming were wrong (the dollar wasn't going to collapse). They got their speculative rise, only to see it fall flat in their face. The reasons WHY are important.
2402 2018-01-04 20:45:37 President Trump has opened nearly all US coastal waters to explore for oil and gas. Great news for the economy, employment and security
2403 2018-01-04 20:45:31 50 million Americans have 401k/ managed retirement funds. Several millions more participate individually. 
Bernie is full of it. 
2404 2018-01-04 20:45:31 hope the guys changing my oil don’t find the weed
2405 2018-01-04 20:45:26 More to the point: how will Trump supporters ever absorb the truth about that snake oil salesman?
2406 2018-01-04 20:45:25 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2407 2018-01-04 20:45:25 Doritos has recently switched from palm oil to sunflower oil! So if Doritos can go green then you can too. By Sofia&Alexis #greenandcleanfood
2408 2018-01-04 20:45:23 You will always need oil to manufacture petroleum products such as plastics. Not stupid. Or a Twitter twerp. Engineer by profession.
2409 2018-01-04 20:45:22 It’s great news for those of you who are sponsored by oil and gas, not for your constituents. But you only care about your financial patrons. #corruption
2410 2018-01-04 20:45:18 Until another oil rig blows up and oil covers the coast line again and kills all the fish.  Another genius idea by the Republicans. But at least the oil companies make money.
2411 2018-01-04 20:45:18 Imagine Government officials with Oil marketers talking of importing refined PMS, they are not even discussing of Refineries. Shame to fake people.
2412 2018-01-04 20:45:15 The way your skin feel when you moisturize with Shea butter + coconut oil
2413 2018-01-04 20:45:14 Most Norwegians have no idea how the arrangement works in practice i.e.  that the country is a rule-taker. Vast oil revenues help distract...
2414 2018-01-04 20:45:13 Coconut oil.
2415 2018-01-04 20:45:09 No idea. Kelly got into them and I was always pissed because she was spending money on them but one night I had the worst headache and my headache meds were failing me. I put some peppermint oil on the roof of my mouth and it went away in 30 seconds so I gave my life to them.
2416 2018-01-04 20:45:06 Finally. No longer will the Middle East, Russia, and Venezuela be able to use the politics of oil. We will be the country that influences oil prices.
2417 2018-01-04 20:44:57 Shaun King said Hillary was exactly the same as Trump. But I just can't picture Hillary ending Obama's marijuana policy or opening up oil drilling while trying to jail her opponents & fire her enemies.
2418 2018-01-04 20:44:44 You know he crawfished on DACA right ..and we have no wall and no plans to get one ..its all a snake oil sale ..your on the train to nowhere ..we have been conned again by politics..and instead of fighting crime ..we are going after a,freaking plant ..no brainer #jumpingoff
2419 2018-01-04 20:44:41 Why is this even necessary? Is there an oil shortage  that we don't know about? This is ridiculous and shameful.
2420 2018-01-04 20:44:28 I was going to recommend a leather oil or leather conditioner to soften and make the back more malleable. Any brand that you come across should work.
2421 2018-01-04 20:44:23 @SecretaryZinke You going to get a bonus from your oil and gas bosses? Want to know how history will judge you? Right down there with James Watt. And any other criminal you can name. #ProtectOurCoast
2422 2018-01-04 20:44:22 We've got oil & propane ones out at the camp, but mostly use the generator bc they also wired the place. When I was a kid it was just those though.
2423 2018-01-04 20:44:22 in a just society at this point anyone who killed an oil executive could claim self defense and win
2424 2018-01-04 20:44:20 @POTUS aims to open California, Florida, Atlantic waters 
for oil drilling. 

How evil can a president be?
2425 2018-01-04 20:44:16 1: But the reasons why it got to 60 were not the ones you claimed. And what you claimed were going to be the reasons were wrong. You're no different than the people who back in 2010 pushed the rise of gold and claimed expertise about it and how the dollar would collapse, etc.
2426 2018-01-04 20:44:13 I’ve spent the last several days oil painting. It’s a lot harder than photography or video!!! But it sure is fun to learn.
2427 2018-01-04 20:44:12 Difference is I’m realistic when it comes to supporting Liverpool, I understand we’re a feeder club! I understand unless we’re bought out by oil rich Arabs that will never win the league, I just wish other people would be realistic to ffs
2428 2018-01-04 20:43:59 Hi Leslie,Thanks for your note! I am the confused one ;^) for sure. I actually had to do a google search on twitter messaging, even though I have been on twitter for many years. In terms of oil prediction, $80, in line with Chris's forecast. Thx again for your note! My confusion!
2429 2018-01-04 20:43:58 I'm also the same with Tonkotsu "Eat The Bits" chilli oil (which sits beside the mustard jar in the fridge)
2430 2018-01-04 20:43:57 Energy exploration? You’re drilling for oil, give me a break
2431 2018-01-04 20:43:57 Is there a high oil low tide at gulf today? Asking for a friend-
2432 2018-01-04 20:43:49 Okay I'll grab the seeds and the bible and you grab the water and holy oil. But feel better  #newbeginnings
2433 2018-01-04 20:43:48 Her heart is broken? And what has the poor bloke done..he hasn’t repelled an invading army! He’s thought a war based on oil
2434 2018-01-04 20:43:44 I’m here for an oil change not a new car
2435 2018-01-04 20:43:36 For a visual of what this would look like, take a look at Santa Barbara, CA were you can’t walk on the beach without getting oil on your feet
2436 2018-01-04 20:43:30 Too late for the Oil,Habs,Sens,Detroit...
2437 2018-01-04 20:43:26 The cocoa butter and coconut oil duo is unmatched. Nothing like it
2438 2018-01-04 20:43:25 Thanks Susan and yeah it is. I've always preferred Cheese on top of my Shepherd's Pie too, I also like Mince from the butcher's, cook it and put some whisked eggs and make them into burgers and fry them in oil, pop them between bread buns... Yummy!  xx
2439 2018-01-04 20:43:22 Drilling for domestic oil offshore is bad for small business?  This is the dumbest tweet of the day.  You're a liberal hack that needs to go.  @HowieCarrShow
2440 2018-01-04 20:43:22 "During the next major oil leak, I will have the drilling companies drop some SPF into the mix and the folks cooling off at Clearwater Beach will be sun-protected. Win win " - Trump
2441 2018-01-04 20:43:21 Can’t wait for the next oil spill!
2442 2018-01-04 20:43:17 
i will rub anointing oil in hands & use mantle to pick it up while whispering "I cover myself with the Blood of Jesus"
2443 2018-01-04 20:43:16 No one wanted offshore wind turbines because the lacked the aesthetics of an oil drilling platform.
2444 2018-01-04 20:43:14 Taking a chance on this oregano oil folks talk about. Between that and the lemon ginger tea I hope to feel like a million bucks!
2445 2018-01-04 20:43:11 Clearly you've never been to the beach and have had your feet covered in oil. Haven't been to the beach since. It is disgusting and still affects my area. That was years ago, I don't want that ever again.
2446 2018-01-04 20:43:09 It means more pollution more dead wildlife more issues with the shrimp and crabs and scallops it will wipe out industries with the first oil spills!!
2447 2018-01-04 20:43:08 Thank you @latimes for making the oil drilling  your top story and not the #oil BannonvsTrump circus
2448 2018-01-04 20:43:03 It’s just brown sugar and olive oil
2449 2018-01-04 20:42:46 If I add coffee oil to an unscented candle will the candle give off a coffee scent? Stay tuned to find out.
2450 2018-01-04 20:42:42 Coconut oil, renpure leave in conditioner and water
2451 2018-01-04 20:42:38 Its winter and ik people skin dries up in this weather so: Blend half a cucumber, cup of dry oatmeal, 1/2 cup of yogurt, tablespoon coffee seeds, 1 teaspoon of vinegar, & 1/2 cup of cocunut oil(whatever oil you’re comfortable with) leave on for 15. Moisturize w/ hydrocortisone
2452 2018-01-04 20:42:25 That's what I'm curious about. When 80% of the Nigerian government's revenue comes from oil, my guess is that it, and thereby we, are a substantial factor in most of their problems.
2453 2018-01-04 20:42:24 Make sure to oil bird’s wings real good
2454 2018-01-04 20:42:14 Another distraction. Keep focus on the oil drilling they plan to do off the U.S. coast
2455 2018-01-04 20:42:13 Well now that I look at it. I'm not exactly right. The oil is legal. Not sure about actual bud.
2456 2018-01-04 20:42:11 Great i don't want country to be dependent on middle east oil. Do you get big donations from middle east countries.
2457 2018-01-04 20:42:10 Cool. No one likes fishing, boating, swimming, surfing, breathing, tourism dollars, eating or summer vacations anyway. Anything to help those cash strapped oil companies get back on their feet. They have had it rough.
2458 2018-01-04 20:42:06 I just paid $40 for an oil change, did I get ripped off?
2459 2018-01-04 20:42:05 Too much oil for me...
2460 2018-01-04 20:41:53 Well my heat is out and the oil company can’t get here then!!
2461 2018-01-04 20:41:53 The people in 29 states that have legal recreational or medical marijuana deserve to know why the will of their votes aren't being heard by the federal government. The people with epilepsy who rely on CBD oil (which doesn't get you high) to relieve their seizures deserve answers.
2462 2018-01-04 20:41:52 لحظات ويتم الإعلان عن احسن لاعب في افريقيا ونتمني من الله ان صلاح يفوز
2463 2018-01-04 20:41:51 bye bye @SpeakerRyan - you will be gone in 2018. not everyone in the US is willing to sell off our environment to make more money for oil and gas interests. your days are numbered.
2464 2018-01-04 20:41:47 Trump Administration Proposes Massive Expansion of Oil Drilling
2465 2018-01-04 20:41:46 It’s like this administration is run by oil and gas executives... oh wait.
2466 2018-01-04 20:41:42 @realDonaldTrump how much will the next oil disaster cost? How much will a wrecked environment cost our children? #WeDontNeedAnEPA #OyVey
2467 2018-01-04 20:41:36 I remember being called a mother-f***** for the first time on an oil rig. I thought, eh. I don't even know your mother
2468 2018-01-04 20:41:29 Please god if you use coconut oil on your skin s t o p it right now & switch to jojoba oil or sweet almond oil
2469 2018-01-04 20:41:20 Kids cooking breakfast for us which is nice but might as well just done it myself - had to go to dairy (nightie under trackies ) for oil, flour and bananas and also had to whip cream and put mix in waffle maker. #shouldveaskedforcoffeeandtoast
2470 2018-01-04 20:41:19 Trump's proposal to massively expand off-shore drilling makes no sense; we have an over-supply of oil, and fracking insures we will have an abundant supply indefinitely. Demand is not sufficient to justify the environmental risk.
2471 2018-01-04 20:41:17 Interior Sec'y Ryan Zinke wants to open huge swaths of the Arctic, Atlantic and Pacific oceans to oil exploration. #hellNo #globalWarming
2472 2018-01-04 20:41:12 @Chrysler got Chrysler town n country 2016. I’m here vacationing vegas n need oil change ASAP. Find me trustworthy dealer do the job. Please help
2473 2018-01-04 20:41:08 Will be bought by the same people that needed a book to tell them " What Happened."
2474 2018-01-04 20:41:08 @realDonaldTrump should let the oil companies drill for oil on his golf courses. That way he can charge them rent like he does the Secret Service that protects him and his family while lining his own pockets even more.

#OldBoneSpur
2475 2018-01-04 20:41:04 Great @SecretaryZinke looking forward to oil spills, threatened wildlife and ugly vistas. Thanks
2476 2018-01-04 20:40:59 @Pukkaherbs Hi guys! Can I use your Active 35 oil during pregnancy?
2477 2018-01-04 20:40:56 Oil is not the future
2478 2018-01-04 20:40:55 So backwards, big oil is running WH #potus
2479 2018-01-04 20:40:48 If you can get it try olbas oil or magnesium oil. They help with joint pain and oils keep heat so it should help with swelling too xxxxx 
2480 2018-01-04 20:40:40 Don’t worry about me I have seen how you behave and I can understand you being upset don’t worry I have made good money here, did tell ppl oil will get to 60 you should have stayed .
2481 2018-01-04 20:40:39 Problem is, we're a breath away (Prince Tala abdulaziz) from $100+ oil.  Can't sht tsla.
2482 2018-01-04 20:40:38 You know it good when the oil floating like so.
2483 2018-01-04 20:40:35 @MSNBC  Another Trump blunder, lets destroy our Government land by leasing it  for Oil & Gas drilling, Trump is destroying America making it weaker  day by day, China & Russia growing Stronger.
2484 2018-01-04 20:40:33 Rose hip oil
2485 2018-01-04 20:40:25 Told dad I could do with some krill oil for my brain, he told me I'd need a couple of gallons for it  Bastard lol.
2486 2018-01-04 20:40:21 チャーリーさん、どーしたんだろうな…
2487 2018-01-04 20:40:20 Trump is the worst President we've ever had. Our national policy should be to leave all oil in the ground & pursue renewables.
2488 2018-01-04 20:40:12 finally got a root canal and oil change. all in one day.
2489 2018-01-04 20:40:08 知ってる？スーパーってタダで牛脂くれるんだよ。
2490 2018-01-04 20:40:08 No more hen that shit taste like car oil anyway
2491 2018-01-04 20:40:06 Oil rigs are proven to HELP the fishing industry.  The algae gives the fish a source of food.
2492 2018-01-04 20:40:05 person against healthcare for all - they bought by healthcare.  person wants pipelines through your land - they bought by big oil.  person against legal pot - they bought by prisons.  you been alive along enough, you know all this crap.  move on forward.
2493 2018-01-04 20:40:00 I can support this line of thinking. To many other GROWING concerns to take away what many say relieves their problems. One of the most amazing vids ive seen all yr was of a small child in seizure that was stopped in seconds w/ cannabis oil. Meds that help ppl- hmm... novel idea.
2494 2018-01-04 20:39:56 You’re a modern day snake oil salesman. BCASH is not Bitcoin. Bitcoin is Bitcoin. Bitcoin Core is an organization, not a coin.
2495 2018-01-04 20:39:36 Oil gang season 2 lol
2496 2018-01-04 20:39:36 But our Military will have plenty of Oil...and those Business in turn, all invest in Military Equipment of all types. Kind of I scratch your back, you scratch mine style that has Always worked when Military in great need. Quid Pro Quo
2497 2018-01-04 20:39:35 don’t fw me dear my vitamin E oil and Crest whitening strips are prospering, you are replaceable
2498 2018-01-04 20:39:35 Seriously, though. How good is eucalyptus oil?
2499 2018-01-04 20:39:34 They want to drill probably because oil resources are going down, just stop driving cars or choose an electric car or motorcycle then and you will stop the climate change.
2500 2018-01-04 20:39:33 You're just being stupid now. The way to cut dependence on foreign oil is to CUT DEPENDENCE ON OIL. Period.
2501 2018-01-04 20:39:32 Florida? Mar a lago soon to become Mar a glug glug We're drowning in oil.
2502 2018-01-04 20:39:18 Your CCN oil is my life saver in this weather @baby_abare Thank love xx
2503 2018-01-04 20:39:17 CBD oil has really taken my migraines down a notch.  I've always been able to treat pot like it was legal though.  In my area there was selective enforcement.  I'm friendly.  Well, a complete shitpile of a human being in some situations (bipolar/ asocial) but I make the effort.
2504 2018-01-04 20:39:12 Screw you @realDonaldTrump @AGBecerra @XavierBecerra  Where's the lawsuit obo #California ?  We don't want oil drilling off of our beautiful coastline.  @JerryBrownGov
2505 2018-01-04 20:39:11 —cracking down on legal pot
—opening all offshore waters to oil drilling 
—freezing security aid to Pakistan

it's been a banner day for Jill Stein voters
2506 2018-01-04 20:38:57 What's your gun oil?
2507 2018-01-04 20:38:54 P1: "how did he die?"

P2: "he squeezed a zit,and it just kept going. Turns out he was just a walking pimple, no blood, no organs, just dead skin and oil. That was all he was"
2508 2018-01-04 20:38:52 ACE @DanielHarris 
City are the PR wing of a repressive oil emirate, while United are the piggy bank of an immoral family of carpetbaggers.
2509 2018-01-04 20:38:36 I am caffeine free. I am showered. I am slathered in @LushLtd Sleepy lotion and @Tisseranduk oil. 

I am going to sleep tonight  (please)
2510 2018-01-04 20:38:30 Try @megagrowth_ke Oil instead. Kwanza it soothes itching kabsaaaa
2511 2018-01-04 20:38:23 Man the massive leaks will put oil on all West Beaches, The Gulf will get polluted again, but this time This President will ignore the pollution and tell us it all FAKE news, there is no Pollution, then pick a fight with a new Brown or Black foreign Nation to distract us again
2512 2018-01-04 20:38:12 Like I got 0 eyelashes and I ran out of oil primer 
2513 2018-01-04 20:38:05 NO! Gulf of Mexico has enough abandon oil rigs. Use them. Don't destroy Florida waters by doing this to our beaches!
2514 2018-01-04 20:38:04 I put a drop of peppermint essential oil in my @JetWaterpipes & now my hits are minty & throat soothing! Really hope I'm not risking damage to the piece though 
2515 2018-01-04 20:38:01 Dems have sided w/big oil, TBTF banks, big Pharma, & elitist policies for the last few decades.
Nothing has been proposed as an alternative to US ancient predatory systems and crumbling oil-backed infrastructure by either party.
We have bipartisan bickering though.
Yep, got that!
2516 2018-01-04 20:38:00 But, supposedly, 90 minute to 2 hr episodes

2552 2018-01-04 20:37:11 My nephew uses a marijuana derivative oil to stop his life threatening seizures. Medication, deep brain stimulation and surgery all failed. FUCK YOU SESSIONS AND TRUMP. BURN IN HELL.
2553 2018-01-04 20:36:52 Your #Democratic allies have prepared for this, protecting the oil companies from the fisherman. @DanBacher
2554 2018-01-04 20:36:50 Add one more. Progressive Liberalism worships government.
2555 2018-01-04 20:36:48 Even after we eliminate all use of petroleum used in burning to generate energy in all its forms we will still need oil for other purposes. Oil drilling and use will continue just on a smaller scale. I rather have the Norwegian model than anyone else's
2556 2018-01-04 20:36:46 Oppose ALL offshore oil drilling!
2557 2018-01-04 20:36:41 "we've replaced Trevor's vape juice with castor oil, let's see if anybody notices"
2558 2018-01-04 20:36:41 But Shaun, how will we,

Fill private prisons,

Remove PoC & the poor from view,

Make money off of oil, wood, cotton patents,

Make money shipping products of those industries,

And promote the idea that only state sanctioned perception changes are morally acceptable?
2559 2018-01-04 20:36:37 Any one know where I can get an oil change for a good price?
2560 2018-01-04 20:36:32 @DeadlineWH  Another Trump blunder, lets destroy our Gov't land by leasing it  4 Oil & Gas drilling, Trump is destroying America making it weaker day by day, China & Russia growing Stronger. De-reg so we all can die of Cancer.
2561 2018-01-04 20:36:18 Why is Trump calling for more off shore drilling? Because his wackos in the WH figured out, the language Trump uses against the Iranian gov’t May cost this country oil.
2562 2018-01-04 20:36:16 Coconut, castor and almond oil is bae
2563 2018-01-04 20:36:07 that comes to $23.08 a week. What are you talking about real money? STOP selling snake oil! 
Can we please see what your "real money" will be as a result of Tax reform? Use your 2016 returns. Maybe include the "real money" your top ten donors will make.
for extra credit
2564 2018-01-04 20:35:55 I thought my skin was bad before lmao but now I have bumps, whiteheads and blackheads, and excess oil on my nose
2565 2018-01-04 20:35:53 in a pinch, you can try olive oil. I understand getting all that done! Oh, and TJ Maxx is a good place to check for carrier oils.
2566 2018-01-04 20:35:53 Throttle back...... Just use the that money for a flesh light and coconut oil.

2572 2018-01-04 20:35:10 Trump & Dana Rohrabacher are opening up more offshore drilling that threatens our coastline. Oil Co's love Dana - just look at who donates to his campaigns.

FROM NOW ON elected leaders should represent you, not special interests. That's why we are not taking their money. Ever.
2573 2018-01-04 20:35:07 @GovRaimondo why take heating oil delivery and repair trucks off the road?  There are people out there without heat....with young children.
2574 2018-01-04 20:34:58 My prefrontal cortex  needs oil tune-up from the Tin Man.  leaning into Energy of grace. Need b12, fish oil, cardio, mediation.... jump start it.
2575 2018-01-04 20:34:57 Californians won't put up with it. We still remember what our beaches looked like after major spills--for DECADES--Santa Barbara still has little oil blobs washing up onto beaches.
2576 2018-01-04 20:34:45 Have you seen of just how revolutionary effective cannabis oil can be in the treatment of epileptic seizures?  Truly, it's remarkable!  And why does Sessions want to criminalize this most effective treatment?   His pals in big pharma don't make $$$. Sickening

2578 2018-01-04 20:34:35 Well, the fact that we will be refining oil here is a good thing, but solely in the hand of a monopolist is evil, popular opinion has it that when buhari increase fuel to 140 in a short time market forces will bring it down but instead marketers are taking adv of us all.
2579 2018-01-04 20:34:35 Can the states do anything to stop this? We are the ones who have to live with the oil filled beaches and decimated environment once these things fail.
2580 2018-01-04 20:34:27 It depends whatever fuel we're told to use.

Currently it shifts between marine diesel oil in Europe and asphalt on international waters.
2581 2018-01-04 20:34:26 Oil splashed onto my eyelid whilst I was stealing @_BlkViking’s Brussels fried rice recipe 
2582 2018-01-04 20:34:25 Wrong again. OIl prices were dropping before the NDP took office. As for "lost good jobs" - why continue production when prices suck and there is no way to get the product to other markets? Why didn't the PCs get pipelines approved? Why didn't they look at diversification?
2583 2018-01-04 20:34:22 I cried.
2584 2018-01-04 20:34:19 3) The smell of pot is AWFUL

Dude.  Which smell are you talking about?

A nug of cured bud smells heavenly.  A used bong stinks.  The smell from roomful of growing plants will choke a maggot.  Making cooking oil smells like a mortuary.
2585 2018-01-04 20:34:17 Yet they ignore the huge oil reserves in Don Jr.'s hair.
2586 2018-01-04 20:34:16 One or two cups is fine...yep..and all those people drinking 4-5 cups...nope! Add the coconut oil...then try bone broth in afternoon! LMK how it goes! :)
2587 2018-01-04 20:34:12 I’m sure it won’t hurt tourism or fishing at all!

What kills me is that Trump HATES offshore windmills, and sued to have them removed from near his Scotland property. Yet putting oil rigs offshore is just fucking hunky dory. 
Wonder if he’ll write in an exception for Mar a Lago?
2588 2018-01-04 20:34:10 The average price of crude oil in the international mart last year was $47/barrel. At 1 million barrels a day, for 365 days, do the maths. Add #1trn from the customs. You'd arrive at over #7trn. 
Last years budget was #8trn. 

Now tell me why we did not have an 80% achievement?
2589 2018-01-04 20:34:07 When you run out of gas for your car and it will happen some day I want to see your face then. Yes there will be oil on the beaches. But we will clean it up like always. It's the cost of our livelihood and you sir KNOW it. Do something else that matters like build the wall!
2590 2018-01-04 20:34:04 Hi Ashley are you referring to the Keratin Healing Oil Combing Cream? Thanks !
2591 2018-01-04 20:34:02 @MSNBC I trust when I turn on the news in a little bit you’re talking not about Bannon but about Sessions and pot, oil drilling and Pakistan. You know, the real important news. #doyourjob
2592 2018-01-04 20:33:54 Just speaking personally, but I'd prefer to have a SC with clean oceans and protected coastal communities than a few more dollars for oil companies.
2593 2018-01-04 20:33:51 @BarryIsFunny poor thing. Can you imagine having to grind on the oil and gas guys and their one piece Carhart uniforms? Ouch.
2594 2018-01-04 20:33:40 It's probably snake oil, but I've ordered a UVB lamp to help with depression and low vitamin D.
2595 2018-01-04 20:33:39 They use Palm Kernel Oil.  SAD!  They should change their ways already.
2596 2018-01-04 20:33:38 If L48 growth failed to hit consensus growth target it was due to the lack of oil services capacities (PP particularly so). OPEC engineered that. + Thinking hedgies directed Saudi and Russia Strategy is completely inaccurate
2597 2018-01-04 20:33:25 Dit toi qu'au magasin ou j'ai acheté la canette ils ont écrit "bigflo et oil" sur l'étiquette t'es pas respecté Oli
2598 2018-01-04 20:33:25 I will revisit this throughout 2018. Like @Oil_Tradr once said, during speculative bulls markets, quacks look like they're geniuses. Your thesis for oil's increase was that "OPEC and shale want 60", and that the EIA weeklies were overstating. What will be your excuse within 2018?
2599 2018-01-04 20:33:18 my car has been out of commission for months & my oldest bro really just asked me when the last time i tried to start it was??? like hellloooooo, i have no fucking oil pan so i literally cant????? u live here how have u not known this lmao
2600 2018-01-04 20:33:11 And those cuts include oil drilling restrictions. I sincerely hope that, if there is a spill, it washes up on Mara Lago. You don't understand the potential damage to Florida's beaches that can result (B.P. spill). Is lining oil billionaires worth that legacy of destruction?
2601 2018-01-04 20:33:02 Ima touch a happy hour after this oil change
2602 2018-01-04 20:32:55 Electric vehicles don't run on oil. Solar panels don't need fossil fuels. Saudis will have oil for millions of years because no-one will buy it.
2603 2018-01-04 20:32:54 And yet he did do exactly that. Snake oil salesmen tell everybody what they want to hear. Like @realDonaldTrump
2604 2018-01-04 20:32:51 We don’t need to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil. We need to eliminate our dependence on oil.
2605 2018-01-04 20:32:50 Yes responsible oil exploration is possible. But what are the chances of that being the case? I haven't seen any regulations on present day drilling, but the present administration is regulations averse. Neither  of us can guarantee oil corps. will drill responsibly.
2606 2018-01-04 20:32:49 Wake up so we are truly not dependent of any Mid East oil!
2607 2018-01-04 20:32:46 like "national security", at this point I feel like oil is a cultural issue like abortion than an empirical one
2608 2018-01-04 20:32:32 I say let's get a big oil company to build a dozen rigs just offshore from Maralago.
#Maralogofuckyourselftrump
2609 2018-01-04 20:32:27 Lmfao depends on the ingredients you use. So instead of using butter and milk I used almond milk and a tiny bit of olive oil and garlic.
2610 2018-01-04 20:32:22 Get ready Florida to see oil Wells from the beach.
2611 2018-01-04 20:32:19 Or burn the inside of your lungs with the oil! That stuff is really potent, same with some other oils.
2612 2018-01-04 20:32:19 @geneticaorganic Follow us + RT for the chance to #win our brand new #organic #conditioner with Chamomile, Rosemary and Argan Oil AVAILABLE on @AmazonUK  LOOKING FOR UK DISTRIBUTORS 
2613 2018-01-04 20:32:19 Give us this day our daily honey soaked bloomer with reduced fat salted butter and thinly sliced Dutch Maasdam with a drizzle of chilli and garlic infused olive oil
2614 2018-01-04 20:32:11 @realDonaldTrump  You want to be a 1 term POTUS??? Lift the oil drilling caps on Florida and the Southern States. FLORIDA DOES NOT WANT OIL DRILLING!!!
2615 2018-01-04 20:32:05 Going to try to wake up early tomorrow so I can get an oil change.
2616 2018-01-04 20:32:03 I know the pot thing is bad but just for today all my fury is for the goddamn oil drilling.
2617 2018-01-04 20:31:59 gold=gift of love's dream...
the gold of your heart is eternal enlightenment... this gold turns to the oil of salvation...
2618 2018-01-04 20:31:51 The US produces more oil and gas than any other country!  We don’t need Iran’s oil!  He wants freedom for the citizens! Something, I guess, you do not understand! #MAGA #FreeIran
2619 2018-01-04 20:31:48 I agree.  What kind of hats should we knit for the protests?
2620 2018-01-04 20:31:46 America is making oil great again
2621 2018-01-04 20:31:44 No no mean for Nigeria problems not the existence of the oil industry
2622 2018-01-04 20:31:39 Did you know? 1 drop of oil when applied to the body can potentially put 40,000 molecules into each and every cell with our body?
2623 2018-01-04 20:31:33 Good move guving Traditionalist their Oil gets them / helps them Kübler their Great Depression Ideas / helps feel Achieved & gets more Martians into Senate so as to Rest in Peace & #boom new era of @solarcity @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @BarackObama @CIA @NSAGov
2624 2018-01-04 20:31:31 I've had it creamed-style (similar to your method), and Italian style (sautéed in olive oil, garlic, red pepper flakes, then braised w/chicken stock). It was still inedible. I'll stick w/spinach. It was good enough for Popeye, it's good enough for me. 
2625 2018-01-04 20:31:22 Fuck this storm bc I was supposed to get my oil diffuser in the mail today 
2626 2018-01-04 20:31:19 Very bad news for the environment as republican continue to ignore global warming sued by oil & coal.
2627 2018-01-04 20:31:19 I thought I needed to run & find somebody to Love , but all I needed was some coconut oil 
2628 2018-01-04 20:31:13 State legislation is a simple way to stop drilling off California: Any oil produced in the coastal waters off California cannot be transported through pipelines in the state; transported to ships or refineries in the state; sold in the state or transported out of the state.
2629 2018-01-04 20:31:02 How do we fight back against oil and gas companies?
2630 2018-01-04 20:30:55 Hopefully some oil will wash up on his property in Florida
2631 2018-01-04 20:30:55 Aチームがマシュ含めて８人。ぐだは実質２人(男女)。合計１０人。クリプターの原型と思われる語「クリプト(crypt)」は「地下聖堂：教会堂や城の床下に作られる、石造りの部屋あるいは貯蔵室」って意味。人理修復にあたるのはもしかしたらぐだじゃなくAチームの誰かかもしれなかった。
2632 2018-01-04 20:30:52 Hydration is KEY. I chug water all day. I stick to coconut oil to clean, L’Oreal grapeseed exfoliater, hope in a jar moisturizer. @InfluensterVox @LOrealParisUSA #Contest #cicacream
2633 2018-01-04 20:30:52 Baby oil huh. You had an interesting night I see
2634 2018-01-04 20:30:47 OIL DIFF: 6.36 -> 6.38
2635 2018-01-04 20:30:43 OIL & GAS MIDSTREAM is starting to produce some viable purchase candidates with solid yields.
2636 2018-01-04 20:30:31 Very few gas stations give you good service like in the old days, when your window was washed,oil checked,and so on I say pump your own gas
2637 2018-01-04 20:30:30 Like. I am covered in gold oil for 100+ days straight. I need the heat back. I made a big mistake
2638 2018-01-04 20:30:28 Venezuela got shafted by oil price and over dependence on it's revenue.
2639 2018-01-04 20:30:10 Double cleansing is advised for makeup users. FYI: Oil based cleansers are great for removing makeup and built-up sebum. Start off by massaging the product onto dry skin, then emulsify with a little water. Gently wipe and rinse away with a muslin cloth.
2640 2018-01-04 20:30:05 Fair I meant the distribution of $ and damage the oil production does to the economy (dutch disease)
Safe I mean well regulated to minimize risk not 100% no problems
2641 2018-01-04 20:30:02 I feel so fkn old taking my car to get an oil changed lmao
2642 2018-01-04 20:29:54 I feel like this tweet missed out on a few good jokes. I expect better! My wife leaks sometimes too, but never oil...
2643 2018-01-04 20:29:47 Trump is preparing to auction off almost all of our country’s coastal waters to oil & gas companies for drilling. This is a recipe for disaster with the potential to devastate the economies of coastal cities and towns.
2644 2018-01-04 20:29:47 If you really want a beard you NEED beard oil
2645 2018-01-04 20:29:45 They’re doing everything they can to give $$$$$ to their yuge oil billionaires. Deplorable
2646 2018-01-04 20:29:39 Fastest oil change of ma Life  lol
2647 2018-01-04 20:29:32 Oil
Brent crude rose by US23 cents or 0.3% to US$68.07 a barrel. The US Nymex price rose by US38 cents or 0.6% to US$62.01 a barrel. 
#ausbiz #oil #markets
2648 2018-01-04 20:29:32 I have been in many shops in the North that fry in lard still so we always ask what oil is used
2649 2018-01-04 20:29:30 It means more oil spills
2650 2018-01-04 20:29:30 Last night I got wasabi in my eyes and now I just got tea tree oil in them, plz send help
2651 2018-01-04 20:29:25 Its actually a clear deal with oil company donors - Koch brothers!
2652 2018-01-04 20:29:22 The truth of the matter Is that the world has moved from oil based economy to knowledge based economy, 

One can survive from what you know how to do better irrespective of what he/she studied (skills)
2653 2018-01-04 20:29:17 No, it means big oil will produce more oil to the detriment of the environment (and people) so that they can sell it overseas for more than they could here. Can you make one statement without blatantly lying to the American people?
#offshoredrilling #ImpeachTrump #Resist
2654 2018-01-04 20:29:13 Doesn’t matter I’m happy anyway  like I said surpassed my expectations, Who ended up being wrong.
2655 2018-01-04 20:29:12 Trim an inch every 3rd month, get  a water based spray or use water,  plait your hair if your are lazy, braids last the longest and they are easy to manage. Get some shea butter, mpl oil, coconut oil and grapeseed oil. Wash, condition and use hot oil treatments. Try stuff out.
2656 2018-01-04 20:29:11 Trump opens up massive coast oil drilling!
2657 2018-01-04 20:29:02 “oil? who said sum bout oil? bitch u cookin?”
2658 2018-01-04 20:29:01 Is this a good investment? Oil has gone cheap,  so that opec was asked to slow down their production. Why risk a expensive oil clean-up for a few dollars? I would advise investors against it.
2659 2018-01-04 20:28:52 I'm waiting for the wolves and abandoned Russian oil tankers to float by.
2660 2018-01-04 20:28:27 They need to hurry up and put some oil in this ancient ass house
2661 2018-01-04 20:28:23 3 / Yeah, with a big book like this, publishers can pull out the stops and rush something into print. I can't imagine, though, that Wolff and Holt were turning this oil tanker of a tome around in 90 days.
2662 2018-01-04 20:28:20 Do know Donald Trump. To many false oil rigs are drilling off of certain parts of the costs of the usa. Which are causing very bad weather to a cure here in the usa.
2663 2018-01-04 20:28:19 sugar scrub: sugar, honey, & the rest coconut oil — mix and add until desired consistency. only use after washing face thoroughly. super moisturizing.
2664 2018-01-04 20:28:15 Just watch the number plummet when the US starts drilling for oil in their calving grounds. (Alaska Wildlife Refuge)
2665 2018-01-04 20:28:13 Ah yes. Scientists in private sector can certainly get chopped - just because the company cans a project. I suppose engineers too get canned when the oil/mining industry tanks. Somehow that is less soul destroying than being told you haven’t made the grade!!!
2666 2018-01-04 20:28:13 Congratulations on the success of the macadamia nut wellness petition to FDA. Please try to get the oil the same status.
#macNutOil_LoseWeight
2667 2018-01-04 20:28:11 That’s true about the Atlantic, but not true about the Pacific off the California coast. Lots of known oil there. But the states have lots of power to make this very difficult if not impossible if they are opposed.
2668 2018-01-04 20:28:11 ProDrivers is who he’s contracted through but 1845 delivering frac sand to oil fields.
2669 2018-01-04 20:28:11 Really want to depend on foreign oil. Like them to have the power of what gas costs plus they need the money for themselves and military so they can come here and kill us. Oh yeah forgot we all smoking pot we don’t care
2670 2018-01-04 20:28:09 Just in: oil drilling in front coast Florida and California. Great plan...NOT!!!!
2671 2018-01-04 20:28:00 Just remembered I get to whip out the old olbas oil sock now that I'm sick 
2672 2018-01-04 20:27:58 Knew this was coming. Trump might as well put the oil companies in charge of the entire country.
2673 2018-01-04 20:27:56 ISIS in Afghanistan vs. Taliban  
ISIS in Yemen vs. civilians and govenment
ISIS in Syria against other opposite groups and terror org..
ISIS in Iraq against minoritys - to invite occupation militaries 
ISIS in Libya against civilians and oil pipelines .. 

ISIS now in Gaza ?
2674 2018-01-04 20:27:54 Did you pick up the stories of Russia and Saudi Arabia decreasing oil supplies while practically the first move of trump was to reduce US strategic oil reserve?
2675 2018-01-04 20:27:54 I'm no oil painting hunnnnny the stuff I send you 
2676 2018-01-04 20:27:49 We all know Dumpster does not do this because of oil and gas supply and demand concepts. He does this as red meat for his moronic base. Really.
2677 2018-01-04 20:27:48 Oh I already use it lol And then I wipe it off and put coconut oil on his feet when we get back in
2678 2018-01-04 20:27:46 Wow, so much for protecting the environment or learning from offshore oil spill disasters. I guess you don't have to worry about that in WI
2679 2018-01-04 20:27:35 You’re a joke. The only comments you’ll take into consideration are those from oil execs.
2680 2018-01-04 20:27:24 Coconut oil has recently received a great deal of attention in the battle against Alzheimer’s disease, due to its ability to stimulate cognitive function, balance cholesterol levels, prevent oxidative stress and boost metabolic activity.
2681 2018-01-04 20:27:18 See brother, his govt have had a lot of sabotage. But there are some things you can't hide. There are major criminals in buharis cabinet. Let's assume that there was no other source of income besides crude oil sales and fictional custom duties gotten last year. /1
2682 2018-01-04 20:27:16 Ok I can understand u know little oil but home girl just used a frying pan of oil like if she was frying empanadas lol
2683 2018-01-04 20:27:15 Yah it's true that there was no mention of the Carbon Tax. But it's paying for big oil's greenwashing. The oil industry got a gift in the NDP. They put in the greenwashing PST which does nothing for climate change. We even subsidize orphan well program. @jkenney @RachelNotley
2684 2018-01-04 20:27:14 Joking with my grandma, I  just said "Let me get $95 Million so I can buy an Oil Mining Rig." She said "Yeah, I put some oil in my car last night." SMH #INeedFriends
2685 2018-01-04 20:27:12 Any chance the first oil spill will just utterly destroy Mar-a-Lago?

If not, then @realDonaldTrump won't give a damn about it.

He only care about things that personally affect him or his businesses.

Not people.
Not compassion.
Nope ethics.
2686 2018-01-04 20:27:11 The price of an oil change is too damn high. I need to learn about cars so I can do this shit myself
2687 2018-01-04 20:27:09 All their cashiers can get jobs on the new offshore oil rigs
2688 2018-01-04 20:27:09 "Unnecessary" regulations? Dodd-Frank and regs from it were necessary after the financial crash of 2008. The regs for offshore drilling that your admin is rolling back are necessary because of the 2010 Gulf oil spill.
2689 2018-01-04 20:27:05 I know why I was so mad after I changed that oil lol
2690 2018-01-04 20:27:02 I hope it's oil free #CicaCream
2691 2018-01-04 20:27:00 I want oil pastels 
2692 2018-01-04 20:26:46 California largely banned offshore drilling, other than what was grandfathered in in Santa Barbara, in response to the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill, then the largest in U.S. history.
2693 2018-01-04 20:26:35 Trump has another distraction for us. Oil won't do much good if he & his pal in Korea decide to launch nukes. T just doesn't care about US!
2694 2018-01-04 20:26:33 then the previous tips should def help! but be careful with the tea tree oil, try it out on smaller bumps but don't put it all over your face it might irritate your skin, only a drop on each pimple
2695 2018-01-04 20:26:32 Biafraland for Biafrans! Biafran oil for Biafran people! Not for thieves and rogues @UKinNigeria @Number10gov @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @VP
2696 2018-01-04 20:26:25 Oh, and lets not ignore it also brings possibility of devastating damage to the environment when it springs a leak!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Dependence of fossil fuel needs to be curbed. I like a CLEAN environment, not an oil sludge in the water!
2697 2018-01-04 20:26:23 Yeah be careful with peppermint oil! Some potent stuff.
2698 2018-01-04 20:26:19 If UK hadn't backstabbed Gaddafi and then supported the Islamists/MB against
90% of Libyans then Libya would surely be a wonderful place to live. But of course, UK needs its cheap oil supply deals to the deteriment of the Libyan people. Your wishes are hollow.
2699 2018-01-04 20:26:16 $TVOG on watch for chart setup - last .0363 up .0096 with 2.96M vol #oil
2700 2018-01-04 20:26:13 The Trump administration, inviting a political backlash from coastal  state leaders,  proposed to open for exploration the largest  expanse of the nation’s offshore oil & natural gas reserves ever  offered to global energy companies, including waters off the coast of  California.
2701 2018-01-04 20:26:11 I’m shedding layers of skin, eczema flaring up, i literally have to soak myself in shea butter and palm kernel oil three times a day or my skin ends up scaly and cracked, lymph nodes are swelling up... and I’ve only been here for one week. Wtf
2702 2018-01-04 20:25:59 If oil stays below $100, and there's no reason to believe that will change anytime soon, that will remain the case
2703 2018-01-04 20:25:56 I don’t think you understand what a commodity is. The US and S.A. both can produce crude oil. Saudis can produce crude and transport it at a much cheaper rate than the US can even produce it. If you want to get into tariffs, that’s a whole other discussion.
2704 2018-01-04 20:25:45 Owner of "crashed" plane linked to Clintons!

1. Company plane was registered to, Abide LLC, owner: Matthew Buergler

2705 2018-01-04 20:25:44 So you think it was a strategic mistake protecting the Suez Canal and our route to oil and the east?
2706 2018-01-04 20:25:29 And it wakes you right up. However, do NOT put the oil into the vaporizer or steamer and IMMEDIATELY stick your whole face over it. It will take care of the sinus thing but could also potentially melt your eyes (or at least the combo of steam and peppermint will feel like it)!
2707 2018-01-04 20:25:17 Thanks!! One side has taken me 1.5 hours and 50 coats of oil 
2708 2018-01-04 20:25:10 @warby_bill your spot on what an oil painting that would be what would the painting be named that's where I'm stumped as you say it's awesome credit to the photographer I'd love a copy of it 
2709 2018-01-04 20:25:02 With everything going on down South from here, I really feel bad for anyone who is living in the US right now with how shitty the conditions are getting.
Meanwhile up here in my city we're getting a Giant green house that will bring jobs and revenue in here since oil stopped here
2710 2018-01-04 20:24:57 Why?  We're not as reliant on oil and gas.
2711 2018-01-04 20:24:55 The paper trail for these decisions is back to the GOP member who have shares or own these oil companies - the offer of their making millions in exchange for their loyalty for this sham of a WH today. It's so obvious that only the almighty buck  counts to the millionaires. Sick.
2712 2018-01-04 20:24:49 Kamala the OIL Drilling Wreckspert...
2713 2018-01-04 20:24:47 I have to go to Whole Foods to get eggs and also salad dressing but I just want a one serve salad dressing, so like would they make me pay for a little container of balsamic and olive oil?
2714 2018-01-04 20:24:28 Oh sure, lets just keep ourselves dependent on foreign oil. No wonder we went backward for 8 years.
2715 2018-01-04 20:24:26 My sister still makes jokes (“ew it’s vegan” as if vegetables and rice are gross? Lmao) but my mom now buys specifically vegan items when she knows I’ll be over her house and makes food with earth balance/olive oil instead of butter, etc etc  slowly but surely!!
2716 2018-01-04 20:24:08 @sfpelosi @SecretaryZinke @washingtonpost 
Hitler removed ALL regs,so oil co. can drill,pollute& spill with NO ACCOUNTABILITY
2717 2018-01-04 20:24:07 Hard to say - and likely depends on who's administration it is in 2022. In the case of the #US #Alaska OCS, high costs, low #oil prices and harsh #arctic conditions mean that momentum slowed until almost everything stopped. 1/
2718 2018-01-04 20:24:01 I heard there are some huge oil reserves off of Palm Beach FL.
2719 2018-01-04 20:24:00 Back to the boiling oil. So peppermint oil (a FEW drops, which was a FEW drops less than I poured!) in a vaporizer or steamer DOES give immediate relief from cloggy, painful sinus symptoms.
2720 2018-01-04 20:23:56 Ciardelli Fuel Company Thank you for  getting oil to us on such a craptastic day! <3 Be safe!
2721 2018-01-04 20:23:45 Don't dirty up Florida waters with Oil Rigs.
2722 2018-01-04 20:23:37 Finnna drop my impala off to walmart for a oil change
2723 2018-01-04 20:23:36 Wait till those #goptaxscam for the middle class & poor kick in & the shit hits the fan. The stock market is only good for big business oil companies etc. Not the middle class & poor. The @GOP has given & you signed a #GopTaxScam that will make the Rich Richer & Poor poorer
2724 2018-01-04 20:23:32 Well MAYBE look at facts that DEMAND has risen substantially ie oil reserves down over 7 Million! Means there’s more demand! Trickle trickle
2725 2018-01-04 20:23:28 Are you paying attention America? That means drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska and the Pacific. And transporting oil, via pipeline, across multiple states. Be sure to take pictures and video so the future generation can see what was destroyed.
2726 2018-01-04 20:23:28 Yet, with declining demand, oil companies are reluctant to invest there, unless money laundering is involved.
2727 2018-01-04 20:23:27 Let’s see how he feels when the oil washes up on his property
2728 2018-01-04 20:23:22 Happy to hear this I don't think people understand that oil dripping from all the vehicles in America account for 98.6% of all polluted roadways and rivers not including fuel and grease lost from vehicles so long as to be safely in the ocean I say go for it to keep our fuel cost
2729 2018-01-04 20:23:22 This nigga really got a Russian oil company in his avi
2730 2018-01-04 20:23:20 Of course, once the platform explodes due to deregulation of the industry, all those workers will have no where to live once the oil decimates the ecology of the area, killing off fishing and related industries and turning residential areas into ghost towns.
2731 2018-01-04 20:23:20 @GaryBarlow do you make raw cakes with cashews, coconut oil and maple sirup? Very healthy treats :-)
2732 2018-01-04 20:23:19 Let’s use our own oil!
2733 2018-01-04 20:23:04 EuroAsia and Chimerica actually create stability in the world. But,  future exports of oil from the US will make Cold War 2.0 (2013-?) more dangerous
2734 2018-01-04 20:22:57 Add baby oil to your beach bag so you can remove the oil residue from your feet.
2735 2018-01-04 20:22:57 Hi! Are you looking for our Marula Oil Liquid Hand Soap? Try checking out Target or an online retailer! It also comes in a Body Wash, which is available at stores like Walmart, Walgreens & Kroger. Hope this helps!
2736 2018-01-04 20:22:51 What could possibly go wrong? Earthquakes, polluting our waters, wow minor consequences for major rewards to oil companies. Just as long ad they make out who cares about the risk to the people that live in those areas.
2737 2018-01-04 20:22:49 You can wash! Just don’t rub your eyes and use an oil free face wash.
2738 2018-01-04 20:22:41 Try cleansing your face with argan oil. Apricot kernel or almond oil will work as well. Just apply and wipe off with a moist cloth.
2739 2018-01-04 20:22:36 There's no need drilling of Gas & Oil in our country's waters is not a good idea of why the Trump Administration shouldn't be doing that is wrong & evil.
2740 2018-01-04 20:22:35 protip: instead of using cooking oil, lie in a frying pan until you start to melt, you fat ugly fuck
2741 2018-01-04 20:22:34 Why is offshore oil drilling a priority with oil prices less than half of what they were 10 years ago?
2742 2018-01-04 20:22:31 I still remember having to scrub my feet w/ lighter fluid to get the oil tar off after going to the beach in the 70's following the SB oil spill.

And I was in San Diego.
2743 2018-01-04 20:22:27 Caster oil
2744 2018-01-04 20:22:20 Mean while Germany had 31 hours of free electricity and some of the lowest rates on average and they are phasing out fossil fuels, our idea is to do the same we have, export our oil and import becoming dependent on foreign oil
2745 2018-01-04 20:22:19 What does "responsibly developing" mean? And why do we need more oil when we have massive reserves in Louisiana?
2746 2018-01-04 20:22:19 My mom always said this was one thing Oregon has over Washington (and their coastline). And it'd be a great niche luxe business model for Seattle (including window washing, oil/tire heck;)
2747 2018-01-04 20:22:16 I'm a 'change the oil in your car (in a bikini) then bake you a cupcake (in a bikini)' kind of bisexual.

I'm kidding, I don't bake.
2748 2018-01-04 20:22:14 @nealcarr1 @Migzmando @TimJen23 boss ass tweet right here
2749 2018-01-04 20:22:09 So keep buying oil from people that want to kill us?  What do we do if they stop selling us oil???  You and the other Hack from NH kill me.
2750 2018-01-04 20:22:05 Teacher: When money is being looted,recovered and relooted..What is it called?
Me: ALOOTA CONTINUA
I know some people go think say I fail am
2751 2018-01-04 20:22:00 My next oil change was supposed to be in September...
2752 2018-01-04 20:21:47 Actually, @oilfractals fractals caught this rise and we all profitted. But either way, this shows you're not legit. You just threw a price in the air based on your feeling's, or based on a now disproven narrative. You were wrong on EIA, and by the end of the year...well.......
2753 2018-01-04 20:21:44 Ultimately the " fairest" election ever held.
2754 2018-01-04 20:21:36 Zinke said the draft National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 2019 to 2024 would make over 90 percent of the outer continental shelf’s total acreage available for leasing, including areas put off-limits by the Obama administration. @reuters
2755 2018-01-04 20:21:31 I couldn’t agree more, but until that day comes we need to tap our own supply of oil.
2756 2018-01-04 20:21:29 Oil change tomorrow 
2757 2018-01-04 20:21:22 I always thought that palm oil was worse. The fact that it has a higher smoking point is good too. I may have  to start using it to cook again. Thanks for educating us!
2758 2018-01-04 20:21:20 But the oil companies will make money. Priorities.
2759 2018-01-04 20:21:07 #trump gas prices at the pump are going to be the highest since 2014, tRump will take no credit for this only for air travel safety, tRump’s oil cronies are being repaid from our wallets.
2760 2018-01-04 20:20:46 Yeah they told me I’ll be doing mostly inspections and oil changes and when it’s slow i can help a friend on fixing cars which they always got
2761 2018-01-04 20:20:36 Closed position in $CBI at $18 for small gain.  A lot of O&G infrastructure already exists, just need to “turn on” when oil goes up. Also, with #WTI projected to hover around these levels this year, don’t see this going much higher. Also, not a huge fan of $MDR deal.
2762 2018-01-04 20:20:30 I AGREE 100%! RUSSIA & OTHER EVIL COUNTRY'S & DICTATORS TRYING TO ENCOURAGE THE USE OF IT TO BUY OIL AND GET OFF THE US DOLLAR! IT'S A DICTATORS COIN BUBBLE!
2763 2018-01-04 20:20:29 I do not want to make a "complaint" bc my landlord is trying to resolve this. He just can't find an oil company who can make a delivery. Will your suggestion help in this scenario?
2764 2018-01-04 20:20:14 Heck yeah, they are! And a massive hedge against another oil shock if you plan to hold them for a while...
2765 2018-01-04 20:20:10 We on California's coast were awoken at 3am by an earthquake. By mid-morning we were alerted that Zinke wants to open areas of our coast to offshore oil drilling closed since our state previously held the record for the nation's largest offshore drilling oil spill. #wokeCali
2766 2018-01-04 20:20:08 Putin needs an oil economy.
2767 2018-01-04 20:20:03 The Gulf Of Mexico have enough Oil Rigs! Do NOT ruin Florida waters too.
2768 2018-01-04 20:20:00 What you really mean is that removing the USA from foreign oil dependence and increasing energy jobs in the USA will make the democratic party look bad.  Please support opening up our oil reserves while they are still worth something.
2769 2018-01-04 20:19:58 Im now predicting that putting castor oil on my brows every single night will be a pain in the ass but who cares, careerin naman natin ang kagandahan since busilak naman na ang puso ko mga sis. 
2770 2018-01-04 20:19:56 I just changed the oil in my 20yr old F150, filled my favorite mug with old oil,2 cream2 sugars better than Timmy's double double.
2771 2018-01-04 20:19:54 MOre Proof baby boomers are ruining the world re living negative side effects of oil gas dirty energy 20th century the only thing trump knows
2772 2018-01-04 20:19:43 Look, you know and I know that most spout off about the benefits of weed, truth is, they just want to get high. They  could care less about any other benefit. I will say though that I have seen children who experience multiple seizures a day benefit from marijuana oil.
2773 2018-01-04 20:19:43 Oil production is WAY UP in the U.S. yet the gas prices are going up. THIS is BS.
2774 2018-01-04 20:19:35 Hey Koch and all oil billionnaires, I would not run right out and spend money to construct wells in our oceans yet.  Next POTUS may change it back.
2775 2018-01-04 20:19:34 @VegaTeam - Hi, is the Palm Oil in your Vegan Protein powder from sustainable sources? Was just about to buy and wondered..
2776 2018-01-04 20:19:32 My ex-Husband/Best Friend was on the DEEPSEA HORIZON for 4years.He moved 2another rig 6weeks b4 it Blue up.BP OIL killed 2of his friends/co-workers & as u know 11 total. His job is in environmental protection of the gulf.I KNOW is about 1rst
2777 2018-01-04 20:19:31 We don’t need more oil!  The market is already glutted.  Even if the oligarchs are doing this to get richer, they should know they can get even richer, employ thousands of Americans, beat China, AND slow the incineration of our entire planet by investing in green energy.
2778 2018-01-04 20:19:25 I say let him rest.  We can handle the Oil without him.
2779 2018-01-04 20:19:19 Apart from the oil price "spikes" and remember all these barrel prices are worldwide not just the North Sea..... the historical barrel price was around $40 and powered the UK economy ...... the barrel price is now $68 ..... sooooo
2780 2018-01-04 20:19:15 This is totally unacceptable! Oil is a poison we need to transition off of & more drilling off our coast just increases the chances of another Santa Barbra oil spill with all of the attendant horrible impacts to #California wildlife, marine ecosystems, & our beutiful #CA beaches.
2781 2018-01-04 20:19:12 僕を酸化させたらダメだよ。オイルにとって酸化は命取り。…僕を見守っててね⁇
2782 2018-01-04 20:18:53 What you really mean is that removing the USA from foreign oil dependence and increasing energy jobs in the USA will make the democratic party look bad.  Please support opening up our oil reserves while they are still worth something.
2783 2018-01-04 20:18:47 China is still supplying oil to NK. China doesn't want chaos in NK. China doesn't want a democratic unification either. What does China want, other than hegemony?
2784 2018-01-04 20:18:35 How stupid do u think people r? You’re in Oklahoma & love oil. We get it. What U don’t get is that 4 the rest kids r more important than $$$
2785 2018-01-04 20:18:27 yes!! just brush them really lightly with a little oil, sprinkle some salt over them, cut into wedge shapes and bake them :)) all ovens cook slightly differently but a safe bet is around 180°C/375°F, start with 7 or 8 minutes then rotate the trays and keep checking them :)
2786 2018-01-04 20:18:25 Trump is ruining our country by giving power and money to the rich and big corporations, removing park lands, opening oil drilling onto protected lands, destroying our relationships with ALL our allies and acting like an ‘ugly America’ every chance he gets.  Impeach him now!
2787 2018-01-04 20:18:17 I think it's crazy that consumers have to pay the money into a pool to decommission old power facilities. Oil and gas abandoned wells, energy decommissioning, it seems wrong that the Alberta public pays when private corporations seem to grow bigger with profit.
2788 2018-01-04 20:18:14 Yep! Also don’t forget curling creams/gels, oil and lots and lots of water. They’re all important for retaining moisture
2789 2018-01-04 20:18:11 No men flirt worst than the men at the oil can 
2790 2018-01-04 20:18:08 Dear Donald, just because you aren’t using the environment doesn’t mean the rest of us aren’t. Quit treating the earth as your private oil drilling spot. Sincerely, most people.
2791 2018-01-04 20:17:52 Just the thought of some warm oil on my back with a deep slow massage  i need that in my life
2792 2018-01-04 20:17:49 That omega 3 oil commercial where an underwater woman in a dress turns into a pill
2793 2018-01-04 20:17:49 Who scrambles eggs with oil EWW
2794 2018-01-04 20:17:43 Republicans are who we thought they were anti marijuana, pro big oil, pro big pharma, anti gays,pro stupid wars, anti science, anti intellectualism. what did yall think yall were getting by not voting for clinton?? @JoinTheMajority @MarijuanaPolicy @CNN @foxnews @msnbc @nytimes
2795 2018-01-04 20:17:35 Raw milk is illegal but water with bird droppings is perfectly fine. 
2796 2018-01-04 20:17:34 Trump is so narrow-minded, how many oil spills and deaths  is he going to be responsible for.  Nothing matters to him but dollar signs.

2798 2018-01-04 20:17:26 my new essential oil diffuser really just fixed all my problems
2799 2018-01-04 20:17:25 Saturated fats are also found in a few vegetable oils, such as palm oil, coconut oil, hydrogenated oils, and chocolate. Heart Health
2800 2018-01-04 20:17:23 We don't need more oil. We have a glut now.
2801 2018-01-04 20:17:19 You'll need.
Cinnamon
Rajah all in one spice
Royco beef(l don't know if they have this outside Zimbabwe)
Cooking Oil
Onion
Frozen tomatoes

Method.
Fry cabbage until half done.add onion and grated tomatoes then add spices.simmer at  low heat
2802 2018-01-04 20:17:18 We are to blame for Sarah Sanders. Ask questions about oil drilling. Ask questions about the homeless.  Ask questions about South Korea. Ask about alt right judges. @realDonaldTrump is screwing up the country while we focus on his diversions instead of the real harm being done.
2803 2018-01-04 20:17:13 It’s all that oil. I think she needs spotters when her feet hit the marble floors.
2804 2018-01-04 20:17:06 Oil on the beach, got all over my feet.
2805 2018-01-04 20:17:05 It works actually, like olive oil  Same thing.  I'm 66 and have no face wrinkles, so, just saying.
2806 2018-01-04 20:16:57 The Trump administration will allow new offshore oil and gas drilling in most U.S. waters, opening access to more than 100 million acres @AP
2807 2018-01-04 20:16:51 Your troll game is weak af
2808 2018-01-04 20:16:44 Why is It taking 5 years to change my cars oil 
2809 2018-01-04 20:16:30 Well I said oil will get to 60 we are closer to 70, I bet that makes you so angry inside  the price surpassed my target lol
2810 2018-01-04 20:16:24 Crude oil settled at above $62. Resistance at $62.58. Up $0.38 or 0.64%
The price of crude oil benefited from cold snap/storms over the east coast of the US, production cuts from OPEC, and lower inventories. The crude oil inventory data today showed another drawdown of -7419…
2811 2018-01-04 20:16:20 Plus there's the issue of whether the oil is really needed. OPEC insists future growth will come from plastics/petchems, but they clearly haven't been watching Blue Planet II. There's growing concern about ocean pollution from plastics and single use plastic is clearly threatened
2812 2018-01-04 20:16:20 Even black market FX traders will have to move up to match the competitive rates of the arbitrageurs, this further crashing rates. Plus our fx reserves are high now, because of high oil price and Eurobond issues, so we can actually afford a separate rate for PMS importers.
2813 2018-01-04 20:16:19 Okay same. And right now I use oil free face wash from Neutrogena and it works so good
2814 2018-01-04 20:16:19 don’t ever get your oil changed at jiffy lube i’m sketched tf out
2815 2018-01-04 20:16:13 Most of the people responsible for candidates massive votes  are subject to "bag of rice" &" groundnut oil". Any other thing is "Story for the gods".

All these talk on social media needs to go offline to the roots. But again, Hunger is a bad thing. Talk is cheap .
2816 2018-01-04 20:16:13 Oil change while I eat lunch lol
2817 2018-01-04 20:16:10 You a grown ass woman, behave LOOL. Mix it yourself. Oh hell no, I made a mixture that I can spray onto my hair to give it moisture but I can’t putting in oil like that unless I’m washing it out the next day
2818 2018-01-04 20:16:05 need a plug in clackamas fuck driving to hillsboro everytime I need oil
2819 2018-01-04 20:16:03 The mix of coffee, green beans, and essential oil my desk mate just sprayed makes my mouth taste like your rich hippie Aunt’s house
2820 2018-01-04 20:15:56 Gulf States have enough Oil Rigs.Don't ruin Florida Waters!
2821 2018-01-04 20:15:42 lmao when ur car runs out of oil hahha >>>>>
2822 2018-01-04 20:15:36 Yes, I am sure that's right. But that suggests it is likely to be a incremental process. Could be 5+ years before first oil, and slow output growth after that
2823 2018-01-04 20:15:28 What oil company is going to invest the vast amounts of money off-shore drilling requires as the energy market continues to lose ground to renewables?
2824 2018-01-04 20:15:25 I agree with you, with the caveat that there is no such thing as an oil rig (on land). A drilling rig makes the hole, then a workover rig (also called pulling unit) makes it into a well.
2825 2018-01-04 20:15:24 Why because you don’t have control over the oil field? Show me how Offshore drilling is harmful if it’s done right
2826 2018-01-04 20:15:22 Even $XOM is almost gapping higher everyday, soon all the oil companies will start being bid for FOMO reasons
2827 2018-01-04 20:15:21 Oil oil oil
2828 2018-01-04 20:15:21 Thank you for the tip!! I’ve had previous experience with castor oil but I only use it for my skin because of how messy I used it to grow my hair but I might try it again!
2829 2018-01-04 20:15:19 I’m getting an oil change and I forgot that there’s a bottle of alcohol and a bottle of wine in my back seat.. I mean they’re not open but still lol.
2830 2018-01-04 20:15:13 Iay just have to bite the bullet and take car in for an oil change.  It's been too cold and snowy to change it myself in my driveway.  Curse you winter!
2831 2018-01-04 20:15:13 But yet oil is from the earth and is the scourge of our planet. LOL!
2832 2018-01-04 20:15:08 @realDonaldTrump Just to let you know, drilling off shore for oil is a very bad thing. You're going to ruin the beaches and marine life in the ocean! You're not a beach or an ocean person son you don't understand. I pray that you will see and understand why its a bad thing!
2833 2018-01-04 20:15:06 I’m with Rick Scott. I don’t know who’s whispering in Trumps ear but we either are or are about 2be exporting oil cause we have more than we need. When you ruin beaches and fishing grounds takes long time if ever to recover. Clean energy way 2go. USANeeds before Big Oil profits!!
2834 2018-01-04 20:14:59 So I needed foundation and cheapest was 5k, so I purchased sunscreen, and castor oil, for less than that, my skin will rest a bit this year
2835 2018-01-04 20:14:58 Are you drinking coffee? You can put the coconut oil in the coffee...that's whole 30 approved. Bulletproof coffee
2836 2018-01-04 20:14:51 My only real goal for 2018 is to get oil changes when they’re due. So far I’ve already failed. But I’ll get it!!
2837 2018-01-04 20:14:47 More destruction of our earth and climate. More leaks destroying ocean life and other wildlife. All in the name of money for rich oil companies
2838 2018-01-04 20:14:36 "Governments in resource-rich countries are usually confident that they are capable enough to negotiate and manage contracts with oil companies, properly account for the new income, and spend the newfound wealth efficiently. But the odds are stacked against them"
2839 2018-01-04 20:14:34 More money for the oil companies; more pollution for Americans.
2840 2018-01-04 20:14:34 Ok so I get up at 9 most days, take a blue capsule at 11am (takes edge off pain but helps my fatigue more) then I use green paste for pain in the daytime as and when required, and if I’m struggling to sleep then red oil about 1-2hrs before bed to wind down. DM for group info.
2841 2018-01-04 20:14:34 Evening all and Happy New Year. I intend to clean up the outside of the MG Metro engine after 29 years of oil and muck. Can anyone suggest a good product to sort this with the engine still in the car please? #ClassicCarHour
2842 2018-01-04 20:14:31 There is still oil on the beaches in Santa Barbara from that spill.
2843 2018-01-04 20:14:21 Yeah, but truth be told our oil reserve  is more than that of Gabon and Equatorial Guinea combined. But Cameroon Gov't hide the facts from it people that is why there are no accountability on the oil been drilled by foreign companies
2844 2018-01-04 20:14:15 So why is the Pentagon against this? Explain that? Nothing to do with fact that big oil own Congress & WH.....

2846 2018-01-04 20:14:08 Cbd oil has been a godsend for me. Calming.
2847 2018-01-04 20:14:06 That your GDP will grow by >2% in 2018? If oil prices drop today and Niger Delta resume hostilities, Nigeria will be back in recession....
2848 2018-01-04 20:14:04 My drops were from overconfidence in heavily political markets like oil and gold. I was straying too far from markets I was comfortable with ... I'm not taking anyone's guidance if I can't have an opinion of my own :u
2849 2018-01-04 20:14:03 Ugh I hate Tabasco sauce. Give me hot oil anytime
2850 2018-01-04 20:14:03 I highly recommend a hot bath with a 1/4 cup of melted coconut oil. Hydrated again. #DryJanuary
2851 2018-01-04 20:13:57 Wall Street Instant Update; Oil (WTI) closes at $62.01/bbl up .6%
2852 2018-01-04 20:13:51 "In December, Interior issued a stop-work order on a National Academy of Sciences study reviewing the offshore oil and gas operations inspection program to enhance safety."
2853 2018-01-04 20:13:50 I thought about it this morning, I said to myself "remember when they refused to fuck the oil?"
2854 2018-01-04 20:13:48 I agree, but corporatocracy is hardly better. Although he enacted some positive policies, Obama also sabatoged the crucial Copenhagen talks, exposed the Gulf to further oil spills with sub-standard regs, & allowed a fracking boom. At least with Trump, you've noticed the problems.
2855 2018-01-04 20:13:47 5305F
2856 2018-01-04 20:13:46 How about Syria? Oh, no oil. Right
2857 2018-01-04 20:13:45 keeva tea tree oil on amazon worked wonders on my hormonal acne!
2858 2018-01-04 20:13:41 I just dumped some peppermint essential oil into the pot of boiling water I have going on the stove to help my sinuses and humidify the house. O.M.G.
2859 2018-01-04 20:13:36 I'm assuming oil and golf clubs
2860 2018-01-04 20:13:36 In their minds they just deregulated some things for their rich friends (oil) and re-regulated some things for their other rich friends (private prisons) = one hell of a day
2861 2018-01-04 20:13:19 Apparently, republican corporations like big pharma and private prisons are unhappy about the challenges presented by legalizing marijuana.  Just like the war against hemp waged by big oil years ago.  Remember reefer madness.  #GOPFascism

2866 2018-01-04 20:12:45 Saute that sucker in olive oil stat!
2867 2018-01-04 20:12:44 It should  take a long( say >6 months)  period of sustained low(<$33/bbl) prices to take us to a point were we could be talking #800/$. Very slim likelihood. Emphasis is on the time cos oil prices will be propped up again by the powers that be
2868 2018-01-04 20:12:42 dk what oil that salon lady applied on my hair but that shit kept my hair frizzy-free for two days straight even when though it rained on the first day. WHAT SORCERY IS THAT
2869 2018-01-04 20:12:41 @willcain 
I ran out of cooking oil oil. Can I use your greasy hair? LOL
2870 2018-01-04 20:12:38 At a time when oil prices are lowest & USA is no longer dependent on foreign oil the #WHCriminal is opening up drilling in all coastal waters b/c nothing matters to this unfit Oval Office occupant except money. Trump needs to go before he destroys our country. #Resist #WHTraitor
2871 2018-01-04 20:12:32 As a non-smelly-things person, I’d just like to formally apologize for all the times I’ve rolled my eyes at people who like to make their houses smell nice (so many times).

In related news, I accidentally acquired an essential oil diffuser and it’s, surprisingly, nice.
2872 2018-01-04 20:12:23 I didn't say be politie. But California tends not to lose lawsuits. Off shore drilling won't happen cuz oil companies need to be able to bring it on shore. Etc.
2873 2018-01-04 20:12:22 .@RoyCooperNC: "Offshore drilling represents a critical threat to our coastal economy. Protecting North Carolina families & businesses is my top priority, & we will pursue every option to prevent oil drilling near North Carolina’s beaches, coastal communities, & fishing waters.”

2875 2018-01-04 20:12:15 tea tree oil is my lord & savior
2876 2018-01-04 20:12:09 @realDonaldTrump Why are you hellbent on destroying everything that is beautiful? Now you want to drill for oil where ocean lovers SWIM!

 You are a national and international DISGRACE! 
2877 2018-01-04 20:12:07 Breaking News: "The Trump administration will allow new offshore oil and gas drilling in most U.S. waters, opening access to more than 100 million acres!" 
2878 2018-01-04 20:12:01 Cutting regulations to allow oil corps to drill their asses off until we have another underwater ecological disaster that we watched unfold while back. When a man is solely driven by he becomes soulless, godless, immortal and plain greedy. #Regulations
2879 2018-01-04 20:11:58 Hopefully more oil spills.  Those are always fun!  Na Zero chance of that.
2880 2018-01-04 20:11:42 She always appears as if she’s had another coat of oil applied to the previous day’s coat so the lies just roll right off her, while rage tasting the fermented Baltic Herring she hoards under her tongue.
2881 2018-01-04 20:11:42 While you're at it why not just give the whole country away to your oil and gas cronies? Interior has never been so corrupt or less likely to protect our planet. Don't you have children or grandchildren?
2882 2018-01-04 20:11:35 The biggest shift in wealth happend in 1850 when discovered oil... the next one is happening now in cryptocurrecies
2883 2018-01-04 20:11:29 Based on what we know about 45's mental acuity (or lack thereof), it is obvious any plans are dictated by Zinke, Scott & other #GOP lapdogs of oil industry. Majority of Americans support clean energy & deplore raping of environment carried out by #GOP. Vote corrupt ba$tards out!

2886 2018-01-04 20:11:14 Have you looked into CBD oil?
2887 2018-01-04 20:11:10 What prevents these ppl from just give what they feel they want to government
2888 2018-01-04 20:11:10 Can understand Trump being vindictive enough to open up oil drilling off coast of California. But did he forget Florida voted for him?
2889 2018-01-04 20:11:09 Being able to drive brand new. Also lease payments tend to be less than if you bought a new car outright. A typical lease lasts 3 years. Since the car is brand new and still under warranty, no maintenance, aside from regular oil changes.
2890 2018-01-04 20:11:09 But if selling, or for about a week until the soap has absorbed the oil.
2891 2018-01-04 20:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza for dinner today will be: burning crust with wet coconut oil and philly beef.
2892 2018-01-04 20:11:00 Yeah, it's olbas oil you've been sniffing...
2893 2018-01-04 20:10:45 Ending legalized cannabis and expanding offshore oil drilling in CA & FL on the same day. — 2018 is off to a roaring start. #voteangry
2894 2018-01-04 20:10:43 Not relevant for the oil S/D balances at least for a few years; but a huge stimulus for US heavy industry and oil services in general, building all the required equipment. US manufacture to remain strong. #OOTT

OR
you could use bananas or avocados to rub in and leave for 30 mins then rinse out
2898 2018-01-04 20:10:16 Why are you applauding yourself for giving Big Oil what they asked for? Look out the window and witnesses the weather carnage you are responsible for.

2906 2018-01-04 20:09:55 I start sweating and freaking out when I have to pull into the oil change place cuz I’m seriously an idiot and can’t pull in straight without the guys laughing at me, someone kill me
2907 2018-01-04 20:09:42 The reason our incredible California coast is so us is because our government said there will be NO OIL DRILLING in our waters. Nunes MUST be defeated Nov 8, 2018. Go Andrew. Get it done.
2908 2018-01-04 20:09:35 How do you cap an oil spill?
2909 2018-01-04 20:09:27 i believe the price of oil is quite well at the moment,must have cashed in his barrels
2910 2018-01-04 20:09:13 And less wildlife, more spills.  We don't need more oil drilling!
2911 2018-01-04 20:09:10 @realDonaldTrump YES! Expand oil drilling. Who wants to be a leader in the energy of the future when we can remain stuck in the 20th century? No one actually wants to get away from non renewables, anyway. That's sarcasm, you idiot!
2912 2018-01-04 20:09:10 All that oil $$$$$ in Texas they couldn't get Dave  but u got Jimbo explain that
2913 2018-01-04 20:09:06 Remember Dustin, FLA a few years back!  Oil on white sand beaches.
2914 2018-01-04 20:09:03 In related news, senior republican officials report imminent orgasms for the first time in decades, cite lack entitlement cuts for ruining tax bill related relief.

Oil company executives are expected to grant them permission, in the coming weeks.
2915 2018-01-04 20:09:02 It's amazing how the oil companies can STILL figure out how to take advantage of renewable energy for their own purposes....this is a Machiavellian maneuver..
2916 2018-01-04 20:09:00 Is this part of an attack on California? First, GOP tax bill is going to decimate California's housing industry (Goldman agrees). Second, Sessions going after marijuana (slam liberalism). Third, oil drilling directly undermines environmental efforts of the state.
2917 2018-01-04 20:09:00 I’m so disgusted by this administration and their lack of care about the people of this country and the environment. One oil spill in the wrong place on the East Coast could destroy the Chesapeake Bay.
2918 2018-01-04 20:08:57 For someone who owns many properties you lease out to oil companies. Isn't your father in law the lawyer to the oil industry? How do you feel about feeding needy children, giving them healthcare?

2925 2018-01-04 20:08:27 ...and financialized oil markets they failed to understand.
2926 2018-01-04 20:08:26 Afternoon! The stock market is up big on jobs news and TaxReform - credit has to go to @realDonaldTrump and GOP in Congress; large swaths of federal waters to be open to oil and gas drilling leading to more US energy independence; controversy over Michael Wolff's book continues.
2927 2018-01-04 20:08:06 Under Obama domestic oil production increased 74% whilst reining in environmentally risky drilling.
2928 2018-01-04 20:08:02 One day you like Federalism, next day it's no good, outdated and Federal Government is seizing more power. It's one or the other.
2929 2018-01-04 20:07:56 I absolutely love cooking with coconut oil cause legit halfway through whipping up whatever healthy as fuck concoction I’m on with, I start rubbing that shit on my face, my hair, all over my entire body.
2930 2018-01-04 20:07:56 So let's see some of that free training in EASTERN PA. a mere 20 training slots for gas and oil industry is laughable.  PITTSBURGH matters.
2931 2018-01-04 20:07:52 ALERT: Trump Administration dramatically expands

2934 2018-01-04 20:07:29 Oil companies are shutting down drilling platforms in CA because they are losing money.
2935 2018-01-04 20:07:13 Unless the price of oil goes up, there won’t be more offshore drilling.
2936 2018-01-04 20:07:09 Perhaps the poisons of Trumpism cost the pederast Roy Moore what should have been a slam dunk victory. Revel in 2016 buddy, its all you have

2938 2018-01-04 20:07:00 I forgot my cats despise the scent of lemons and I started diffusing lemon essential oil.... whoops 
2939 2018-01-04 20:06:56 Just wait until the next great oil spill. No wildlife, fish, just a huge coast line of oil slicks. I bet you’ll not say a word.
2940 2018-01-04 20:06:52 nah man. 
when i was moving 4 years ago my left was covered in scond and third degree burns from an oil fire. 
i was bleeding all over the place.
I had to wear my snowboard gloves to pack anything, it was wild,
2941 2018-01-04 20:06:46 Congratulations to Paul A. for winning the Go Green email drawing for a free oil change in December!
2942 2018-01-04 20:06:37 @realDonaldTrump You really don't believe in renewable energy, huh? What is it with you Republicans and oil? You guys don't care who you hurt or what you kill. If there's a profit to be made you'll move heaven and hell to make sure you get your piece. #Impeach45 #NotMyPresident
2943 2018-01-04 20:06:36 ...mix tablespoon honey, some ground ginger & chilli powder (or fresh), tblsp soy sauce & tblsp toasted sesame seed oil, then pour over chicken & veg. 20 mins in oven at 200C/400F. Very tasty. It’s a mary berry recipe
2944 2018-01-04 20:06:31 States want legal pot, Feds say no. States don’t want oil rigs, Feds say yes.

2947 2018-01-04 20:06:09 #Tax "reform" to benefit himself & wealthy donors; prosecuting medical marijuana trade in states where it's been legalized; offshore #oil drilling by beach resorts; abandoning a US territory (PR); & uranium mining in Utah national parkland. #Trump WANTS to get Fired. Let's do it!
2948 2018-01-04 20:06:07 We don’t need more oil at the cost of our oceans

2950 2018-01-04 20:05:52 Uhhh this says it uses peppermint oil to make you feel cooler than you really are. Sounds like a TERRIBLE idea for fursuiting
2951 2018-01-04 20:05:46 Do you even realise how much material ICT  teaches renaming concepts and not giving credit to original authors , then outright lying saying that they took the idea from him in -1992. He is a snake oil salesman those who disagree are sheep just like I was many years ago..
2952 2018-01-04 20:05:43 So there’s scarcity for a number of reasons. 1) Oil price as of today is above $68. Thus; making PMS more expensive to import, while NNPC keeps ceiling price still at N145. Bottom line, there are thinner profit margins and growing costs.
2953 2018-01-04 20:05:37 That or Trump's win was simply a fluke because he ran against one of the worst candidates ever.
2954 2018-01-04 20:05:24 It’s time to see if Sens. Harris, Warren and Gillibrand want a personal political career over an important issue of medicinal access to CBD oil (no high) and commercialization for personal use as a State’s rights issue.  Who will join Rep Gabbard?
2955 2018-01-04 20:05:19 more oil & gas means independence from foreign oil & gas + ability to export, so yea more is always better. if there's a drilling site that is particularly likely to spill, then that particular site shouldn't be utilized. others should.

meanwhile court docs should be enforced.
2956 2018-01-04 20:05:18 U mean to tell me Texas A&m  couldn't pull no $$$ out all them oil wells

2958 2018-01-04 20:04:53 Marinade them beforehand! 2 Tbsp olive oil, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 1 clove minced garlic, oregano, salt and pepper. Put it all in a big Ziploc and let the chicken sit in it for at least an hour before baking. 
2959 2018-01-04 20:04:47 I felt well enough again today to cook and eat. Haggis, on a pile of potatoes fried in olive oil and garlic.

2961 2018-01-04 20:04:42 The whole "states' rights" stuff was slave states not wanting the federal government to limit (MO Compromise, etc) slavery. Then it was about limiting civil rights.

2963 2018-01-04 20:04:37 I would usually say that pussy need an oil change.. but after 8 years she might just need a new pussy all together
2964 2018-01-04 20:04:22 Why does it look like there are already oil rigs off the coast of Santa Barbara?
2965 2018-01-04 20:04:21 The BP oil spill cost $62 billion. Your policy changes will save the oil industry $900 million. Something doesn’t add up. Do you guys even know how to math?
2966 2018-01-04 20:04:17 I use an all natural tea tree oil one bit that one is specifically because I have acne
2967 2018-01-04 20:04:14 Granted there was no ranch in the house but I just used some olive oil and seasonings and dare I say it was almost better than ranch 
2968 2018-01-04 20:04:04 Electoral college that's probably true, but 1) some vulnerable CA GOP House seats and 2) "pot bad, oil good" might encourage some addtiional rich Dem donors
2969 2018-01-04 20:04:02 Trust me , trump didn’t think of any of that on his own !  Big oil companies have control of him and tell him what to do and say
2970 2018-01-04 20:03:55 Can things get any worse. We've now run out of heating oil 
2971 2018-01-04 20:03:54 I had to have my fuel nozzle replaced and then an oil change, then they called and said my rear breaks needed done so 
2972 2018-01-04 20:03:50 That's exactly what I was looking for . well if that's the case I won't mind spending the 13 it's like a 2 in 1 . I know olive oil is really moisturizing so I figured it would work great . Have you tried any of the lotions ?

2977 2018-01-04 20:03:26 when u not about antibiotics or going to the doctor for every strep-like sore throat, but the oregano oil garlic n ginger regimen u been on since monday not working it's magic
2978 2018-01-04 20:03:25 Has the GOP declared war on California?  First, a tax bill to undermine its housing industry.  Second, a shot at its liberalism by going after marijuana. Third, going after its environmental concerns by selling off its coastal waters for oil drilling.
2979 2018-01-04 20:03:25 having hair oil n face masks n scrubs n coconut oil makes me feel so fresh !!!!!
2980 2018-01-04 20:03:23 Yay, let's go all in for yesterday's energy! By drilling along our coasts! What could possibly go wrong? If only we had some record of past offshore oil exploration accidents... #TrumpIsAMoron #CleanEnergy
2981 2018-01-04 20:03:16 More pollution in the sea & death to sea animals and Food sources. Sad that 1%oil Barron's take precedent over the environment, sea animals, & food sources but alas that's the GOP way 1%, Corporations and lobbyists 1st people last

2985 2018-01-04 20:03:02 Very true! I also don’t go to McD’s or kfc for prob the same reasons as you. Just asking about oil is a good tip I didn’t think of! Thanks :)
2986 2018-01-04 20:02:41 For the liquid I use the Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Leave-In, the oil I use just regular Jamaican black castor oil and then I use Cantu’s Coconut Curling Cream

2992 2018-01-04 20:02:20 @kfcnz Napier KFC worst ever Kentucky ever. No mash with combo 1st compromise from my side. A handful of serviettes provided was not enough to drain the oil from the chicken. No crispy chicken as advertised instead soggy oily chicken. I will never support this KFC branch again.
2993 2018-01-04 20:02:17 In 2012, when the current collapse started, we had an economy growing at 8% and relative peace. Right now we have a collapsed economy and social. This fx subsidy is a bet that oil prices won’t collapse. If/when oil prices reverse 1k/$ will be optimistic
2994 2018-01-04 20:02:13 Right now your money is safer invested in oil spill removal companies than it is oil drilling companies
2995 2018-01-04 20:02:13 How about we start drilling in Wisconsin? Have you ever been to the coasts? We don't need offshore drilling. We need you & your oil cronies to come on in to the 21st century and learn about green and other alternative energies. Way more jobs. Way better for the economy. #dumbass

2999 2018-01-04 20:02:01 I agree right off the coast of Palm Beach, can ship the oil out of Palm beach port on barges, the infrastructure is already in place to ship it oil, the port has being doing it for decades

3005 2018-01-04 20:01:15 not if another oil spill occurs. millions  of people live near California coast. off-shore drilling is different here as opposed to Gulf Coast or Alaska. Washington will lose this fight (again).
3006 2018-01-04 20:01:10 First, we’re talking medical marijuana, not recreational. It can be used in edible form or as an oil. Second, no one is advocating getting high and carrying a gun. They have isolated strains that target pain, insomnia or other specific medical conditions.

3008 2018-01-04 20:01:08 Rubbing alcohol / nail polish remover- if that doesn’t work use an oil and sugar, make a light exfoliating face scrub. It won’t all come off immediately but they should fade it quickly.

3034 2018-01-04 19:59:39 Totally - seems to have been pretty well securitized by the military establishment, or at least on the way. (just like the oil companies long ago accepted climate change). But in public discourse the militarization of Christmas has outpaced the militarization of climate.

3037 2018-01-04 19:59:33 Just saw photo of drilling rig being towed out to sea. Trump is proposing offshore drilling again, notwithstanding bad spills in past by bad actor oil companies (i.e. Exxon, BP) we should tow Trump out to sea. He's loaded with lots of oil from burgers.
3038 2018-01-04 19:59:31 You can thank the oil and gas industry for the rapid disappearance of Louisiana wetlands.
3039 2018-01-04 19:59:29 The R&D spending point is a really good one. Shale oil and gas drillers have revolutionized the industry and cut breakeven prices in the past decade without spending a dollar on "R&D" as measured by GAAP.

3043 2018-01-04 19:59:13 We have solar power, wind energy, and cars being powered by battery, so lets drill for more oil! Why?
3044 2018-01-04 19:59:12 More oil spills. Oh boy. Yippee.
3045 2018-01-04 19:59:07 To truly fight it, fight for #fuelchoice. Only diversification of our transportation fuels market will keep oil prices low for the long term. It's econ 101: competition levels out prices. With $50 oil, drillers will never be able to justify offshore.

3088 2018-01-04 19:55:25 Ya, now he is going to open the entire US shoreline to oil and gas drilling. lol
3089 2018-01-04 19:55:24 The real answer: Because Trump is allowing Oil Companies to taint U.S. waters with unsafe drilling practices.

But that's cool, just let your bias guide you without caring for the consequences.
3090 2018-01-04 19:55:16 This is not good news for anyone living in the ocean. When the oil spills hit the beaches please be there to help with the clean up.
3091 2018-01-04 19:55:10 If Greenpeace really want to make a point about how bad oil is maybe they should use a wooden sailing ship and rowing boats for these protests? Your boat is made from oil, your waterproofs are made from oil..
3092 2018-01-04 19:55:09 dude they want to move oil drilling offshore..where are the protestestors for that? Where are the petions? Where is the tweets and celebs speaking up?
3093 2018-01-04 19:55:09 Hopefully this oil change doesn’t take long. Im so tired
3094 2018-01-04 19:55:06 One more deplorable act to be added to the rest of them and just like many of those there will be lawsuits to stop this action as there is no good reason for this other then to please Oil companies who probably donated to this traitor.
3095 2018-01-04 19:55:05 More drilling rigs in the path of Hurricane Harvey; rigs anew in the path of the Bomb Cyclone; more rigs along California's earthquake-prone coast, the super-sensitive Arctic, and the Gulf, where a blanket of millions of gallons of BP oil still coats parts of ocean floor.
3096 2018-01-04 19:55:02 There is no oil there. But don't let that stop you from being a fool.
3097 2018-01-04 19:54:56 When you go in for a free oil change and find out your car needs like $1000 dollars of various fluids replaced. 
3098 2018-01-04 19:54:54 Having my car is nice, till I realized oil changes for it are $79
3099 2018-01-04 19:54:48 Where's your logic? So you are telling me drilling for oil here is different from drilling elsewhere? Our PLANET is everyone's. West coast to the other side of the world, imagine a world with NO oil...come on now. Oh wait is this about global warming
3100 2018-01-04 19:54:36 So glad you had a good time! We've got the marketing team burning the midnight oil (aka working through this crazy snowstorm) to make sure the next one is just as much fun! #Podcast #podcastmeetup
3101 2018-01-04 19:54:35 I hope FL (R) Rep Vern Buchanan's Gulf Front mansion gets oil slicked.

I'm leaving this God Awful state anyway.

The people that voted Red deserve it.

The rest of us should leave.
3102 2018-01-04 19:54:28 Slice it, season it put a little oil, put the oven on low broil and that's it 
3103 2018-01-04 19:54:16 Hell yes! It feels like they put oil in it, I don’t even need lotion after my showers.
3104 2018-01-04 19:54:14 Not a super big deal but I changed my own oil
3105 2018-01-04 19:54:03 my state, florida, still hasn't fully recovered from the last time offshore drilling happened- the BP oil spill. it devasted our economy which still hasn't recovered, and tar balls still float up every now and then

wants to fix the economy but offshore drilling will fuck it up
3106 2018-01-04 19:54:01 The rare Rick Scott-Marco Rubio-Bill Nelson agreement against Trump administration move to allow oil drilling off Florida coast
3107 2018-01-04 19:53:57 Imagine paying £999 for the day Worcester doesn't have the heating on and an oil heater and an electric heater
3108 2018-01-04 19:53:56 feel like you getting a pimple,  put tea tree oil on it .
3109 2018-01-04 19:53:54 2018 to do:
-go camping
-do one big oil canvas painting
-move back out of my parents house
-go on an ikea field trip
-also more museum field trips
-be nice to myself
-retain some chill
-and maybe.... adopt another cat????
3110 2018-01-04 19:53:52 You done used up my $40 oil in your beard but I gotta go to hell because i took a piece of your sandwich.. Outrageous
3111 2018-01-04 19:53:50 No it wasn't made illegal to demonize & arrest people of colour. It was made illegal because hemp would have made too many people lose money who where invested in cotton, forest & oil industry as hemp is a superior product. Since then other industries have helped keep it illegal
3112 2018-01-04 19:53:45 Place them in my warm hands
Ill gently oil n massage them 
3113 2018-01-04 19:53:45 Lol. You'd rather we get our oil from the peaceful Middle East?
3114 2018-01-04 19:53:45 For openers, yesterday's stock markets had oil at $61 per barrel meaning we have a glut of oil. Disturbing the underwater plates of the earth will certainly result in more earthquakes. Cali already has that  problem but drilling/fracking will enhance the frequency of events.

3116 2018-01-04 19:53:42 Are your friends at ALEC, Heritage Foundation, & the Koch Brothers pleased at your continuing their agenda?  First the tax scam. Now oil drilling in the artic and offshore coastal regions. *Drill baby drill!*

Tell me something. Do you have ANY honor left? 

Didnt think so #shill
3117 2018-01-04 19:53:32 @realDonaldTrump

So, how much did oil companies pay you to repeal Obama's policy? Millions? Billions?

Second question: Did they pay you extra to expand their drilling areas to all of the U.S. waters as well?
3118 2018-01-04 19:53:29 I don’t understand oil industry already stumbling,it’s not right time for oil business
3119 2018-01-04 19:53:22 coconut oil 
3120 2018-01-04 19:53:17 When I was on chemo, I used CBD oil to combat nausea & achy-ness. It was amazing at making me feel better. CBD oil does not have THC in it so no psychotropic effects, but the medicinal effects were so helpful. I now have a rheumatoid condition & I’m going to try it for the pain.
3121 2018-01-04 19:53:16 everyone makes jokes about young people having weird sexual fetishes these days but back in the 1920s everyone was like "ma'am i don't wanna cause no malarkey but olive oil from popeye would get it"
3122 2018-01-04 19:53:06 When you're finished cleaning it up and putting the new belt on, check the wheel alignment, that can be a nail in the coffin for a belt already stressed from nasty oil.
3123 2018-01-04 19:52:55 No I contacted the store and they had them pull the video. They said no was no concrete eveidence. Windshield is damaged and they left the oil drain cover locking tab in my passenger floor and never told me anything. Horrible experience.
3124 2018-01-04 19:52:49 Kamala prefers that the oil which powers her car, should dirty up other countries - where environmental controls are weak or non-existent. Drill here instead; the world will be better off. And so will the US! Why fund Russia or middle east despots? Buy US oil !
3125 2018-01-04 19:52:41 Must the exchange rate be static. Must the rate be 360/$ irrespective the price of crude oil?@, $40=360 $45=360, $55=360, &60=360, $68=360. Isn't this rate abnormal?

3127 2018-01-04 19:52:31 @oilandgasuk Hello! how are you? Are you familiar with GAI-Tronics? We create paging/intercom and rugged telephony products for oil and gas and other industrial environments.
3128 2018-01-04 19:52:28 I hate getting my oil changed and they start lookin hard. Like boyyy if you don't just pay attention to the oil 
3129 2018-01-04 19:52:26 Basically they are saying they would do the right thing, if they were FORCED to. 
3130 2018-01-04 19:52:24 It seems as if the Trump administration has created a bipartisan alliance in Florida against its oil drilling plan announced today. @realDonaldTrump won Florida & its 29 electoral votes in 2016
3131 2018-01-04 19:52:20 Really had to get on that cold ass ground to change my oil and I'm slick pissed about it
3132 2018-01-04 19:52:18 No, that's somewhere in Southie. And the oil company said they'd send someone out with 5-10 gallons today. Hope they get here soon.
3133 2018-01-04 19:52:13 Saying that I'm excited about the Trump Administration's new draft five-year plan for oil & gas leasing would be a major understatement. This is how you create jobs, achieve energy independence, and Make America Great Again!
3134 2018-01-04 19:52:09 Do we want to remain dependent on middle east oil? I would love to see us out of the middle east entirely.
3135 2018-01-04 19:51:57 Who wants more chance of an oil spill because of loose safety rules? No one! Hope it gets blocked!
3136 2018-01-04 19:51:53 Yay! More oil exec helicopter rides for @SecretaryZinke! #CorporateWhores
3137 2018-01-04 19:51:48 Trump deserves it! But the 61% Americans who belive and want to shift away coal and oil ti clean renewable energy to save the earth and the next generations DO NOT!
3138 2018-01-04 19:51:47 Just douse my whole existence in coconut oil. It'll fix everything.
3139 2018-01-04 19:51:46 The opposite is true, offshore drilling could bring good paying jobs to Fl and help the economy, using our own oil is great for national security, if we don't need the oil they won't drill for it, stop using the oil, widmills kill more endangered birds and injury more workers.
3140 2018-01-04 19:51:45 How to be a 90s rnb singer:

1.) rub baby oil on ya chest
2.) never smile
3.) tell a female how smooth, soft, and silky she is.
3141 2018-01-04 19:51:36 If you'd told me 30 years ago that the darling of GeeH would be a brain damaged hitman whose portrayer peddles snake oil ... I'd believe it about as much as I believed DT would be POTUS about 2 years ago. Thanks for continuing to surprise me with the ish you will support, USA ...
3142 2018-01-04 19:51:36 I know I'm no oil painting but he was pretty gross
3143 2018-01-04 19:51:36 avocado oil? well 
3144 2018-01-04 19:51:30 Do you ever see an oil painting and just think “yeah well fuck you too”
3145 2018-01-04 19:51:28 trump is a puppet of US and Russian oil money.
3146 2018-01-04 19:51:14 It will also mean more oil spills, and more pollution, and more toxic runoff, and more mutated sea life.
3147 2018-01-04 19:51:02 Today you announced the  further decline of progress from a once great leader on the world stage. The US will horde it’s oil which will be useless and worthless while polluting the land, skies and seas! Meanwhile the rest of the developed world will use renewables! Oil is not it!
3148 2018-01-04 19:51:01 Oil and Gas was going to be expensive forever until it suddenly wasn't.

Now Oil and Gas is going to be cheap forever until it isn't.

Is there a pattern here
3149 2018-01-04 19:50:44 Toho9000 are the best oil additive in the hold wide world . you better belief it
3150 2018-01-04 19:50:44 I can’t work with this narcissistic control freak. We are oil and water. 

And it’s a snow day and I’m not having any fun because... I’m under his thumb.
3151 2018-01-04 19:50:38 ANWR is not so much about the actual oil. It's about destabilizing the immutable protections of various wild public lands - see Utah national monuments. 

The oil companies aren't exactly chomping at the bit to get up there anymore.
3152 2018-01-04 19:50:34 "let them drink oil." Line of the day.
3153 2018-01-04 19:50:28 @TheOilCouncil Hello! are you familiar with GAI-Tronics? We create paging/intercom systems, and rugged telephony products for oil and gas and other industrial environments.
3154 2018-01-04 19:50:26 Some of them may have even changed their deep fryer oil since then.
3155 2018-01-04 19:50:22 It’s another diversion tactic by Trump.

Let’s threaten folks with oil on the beaches and taking away legalized pot. That will rile up plenty of people while we go over here and do really bad sh-t. That’s classic Trump behavior.
3156 2018-01-04 19:50:19 What have the Afghan people done to deserve a war that has killed over a million people? 

Answer = Oil & Gas
3157 2018-01-04 19:50:12 I hate places like that.  They do get the occasional sucker.  Just change the oil and give me my damn truck haha
3158 2018-01-04 19:49:58 It’s so cold midnight oil just froze itself to sleep.
3159 2018-01-04 19:49:57 Are you saying England would not trade with indy scotland?
where would they buy their oil gas water and electricity?
As Clinton said Its the economy
3160 2018-01-04 19:49:56 nothing from @climatepeacocks @RepCurbelo on offshore oil drilling. He's voted FOR it once already.
3161 2018-01-04 19:49:52 I’ll have to look into it! I’ve dabbled in different ones and had varying results, but normally I’m fine after I put on some powder to absorb the extra oil
3162 2018-01-04 19:49:49 my auntie got this wild growth hair oil and i put that shit on my scalp, eyelashes and eyebrows 
3163 2018-01-04 19:49:48 We have so many deep sour oil wells out here they could easily convert them over to geothermal power wells and generate more power than every wind farm in the country.
3164 2018-01-04 19:49:41 Let's get into oil refining and usage in factorio!
>accidentally opens a can of worms
3165 2018-01-04 19:49:37 the Smart choice , the Future and Progress for USA is Clean Green Energy . Coal & Oil dependency is backwards thinking .
3166 2018-01-04 19:49:30 The SNP were stunned when oil collapsed right after Ref vote
They've moved painfully slowly to admit reality(via the ludicrous*Oil is only a bonus*soundbite)to the truthful*High oil was baked into the case*.

Soc Media cybernatics just don't seem to have made this same journey
3167 2018-01-04 19:49:28 More back room deals and now we know why the protection of offshore oil rigs was overturned. You are a disgrace.
3168 2018-01-04 19:49:26 Trump’s energy plan that will:

-Subsidize coal

-Open up federal land to oil companies for drilling

-Tax imports on solar panels

In other words, it will pollute our air, poison our water and destroy the environment.
3169 2018-01-04 19:49:22 Obj made a down payment to enable us have the rails in 2010 from lagos to Kano but the Yar’Adua admin suspended it without considering the consequence. GEJ, despite the oil windfall, could not award the same project the way Obj envisioned it. Let’s not revise history
3170 2018-01-04 19:49:08 Vitamin E oil
3171 2018-01-04 19:49:07 I manage mine through eucalyptus oil  & antihistamines
3172 2018-01-04 19:49:05 And more oil spills, more pollution and most of all... more money for the Big Oil Conglomerates which in turn will produce larger campaign contributions to the GOP Congress and POTUS that they own. In the end that’s what it’s all about eh, Mr Speaker?
3173 2018-01-04 19:49:01 And oil washing up on beaches where our children play in the surf.

3176 2018-01-04 19:48:53 Interior Secretary Zinke announced plans to allow new offshore oil and gas drilling.  Attorney General Sessions announced changing federal enforcement policy on marijuana. 

Announcements to drown out yesterday's bad-for-Trump news?!?
3177 2018-01-04 19:48:42 Can you guarantee there will be no oil spills?
3178 2018-01-04 19:48:30 new jersey and oregon are weird as hell man. they do it in some parts of canada too. checked the oil and shit like i was in a weird 50s movie
3179 2018-01-04 19:48:27 I’ve been sitting at Waite Toyota since 1:30 for a oil change.. this is fucking crazy 
3180 2018-01-04 19:48:23 Your post displays gross ignorance. Something a Doctor should avoid. Kochs just as philanthropic as a Bill Gates relative to income
3181 2018-01-04 19:48:21 just tung oil. or BLO. about three coats, dry between. then a regular oil to keep them proofed and bright.
3182 2018-01-04 19:48:14 Whatever it takes for oil and gas independence...
3183 2018-01-04 19:48:11 only using coconut oil & 
almond flour
3184 2018-01-04 19:48:07 To serve the oil companies greed
3185 2018-01-04 19:48:02 Trump & the complicit GOP have two modes: bully & victim. They played victim under Obama, & now they're bullying the crap out of America. Assaults on DACA, new oil drilling, the Muslim ban, the wall, tax scam, etc. Keep calling them out. Stand up, speak, act. Empathy will win.
3186 2018-01-04 19:48:02 Perfectly normal low figures say our glorious leaders            Does not matter that figures trebled in our stunning recovery . Just look at the Bigger Picture we're paying 42 per cent of Europes bank debt  sold our oil with brian cowen on the board to watch our interests. Wow
3187 2018-01-04 19:48:00 pensei que tinha passado oil na cara, eu ri pakas sorry
3188 2018-01-04 19:47:54 sesame oil > any other oil
3189 2018-01-04 19:47:52 I'd probably not even bother to shovel for a couple days after that. With the exception of what the plow throws up at the end of the driveway. That turns hard as rock & my car rides low. I'd tear off my exhaust system or oil pan etc. Once the plow goes through, I'm out there fast
3190 2018-01-04 19:47:50 These off shore drilling platforms have replaced over 85% of the American Oil Workers and brought in Foreign Workers.
3191 2018-01-04 19:47:47 Lol the man of my dreams might appear in my dreams. Got to be ready man. I need the extra oil 
3192 2018-01-04 19:47:43 Then: What to open for oil and gas exploration after the desert, the ocean bed, the rainforest, the river deltas, the sands, the rocks and now the #Arctic?
3193 2018-01-04 19:47:43 Looking forward to the Oil making Duck soup tonight 
3194 2018-01-04 19:47:38 My mom sat ON A PLANE, in the gate, for 3 hrs 45 min for a 40 min plane ride. 
Reasons: 
1. Snow plow ran out of oil
2. When they were ready to go, ppl wanted to get off.
3. Baggage cart got stuck in snow to get leaving ppls luggage.
4. De-icing wings.
Thx AA.
3195 2018-01-04 19:47:31 It’s kind of like renting. You always have a car payment. You can only drive a certain number of miles a year. You tend not to have as many maintenance costs, except for oil changes.

3201 2018-01-04 19:47:20 I just ran out of coconut oil omg rip
3202 2018-01-04 19:47:19 But we need more money to spend possibly invading Venezuela to take all their oil baby!
3203 2018-01-04 19:47:18 I been well wheres the old crew at?
3204 2018-01-04 19:47:14 Price rise is almost exclusively a function of 1)higher worldwide crude oil prices, 2) a lower $, &  3)a stronger US economy vs. a year ago.

3208 2018-01-04 19:47:00 Sorry, but you are DEAD wrong.  Meta data shows that over 98% of ALL studies, grant funded or not, demonstrate climate change is real and caused by us.  A few crummy grant dollars mean nothing in the face of big oil money, which is the propaganda you eat up apparently.
3209 2018-01-04 19:46:50 GE Oil and Gas in OKC is shutting the facility down as of Feb. 28 causing my husband to lose his job. I believe they are moving some of it to Houston and some production moving to China.
3210 2018-01-04 19:46:50 Yes, he halted off-shore oil drilling, capped carbon emissions, and vowed to clean up all EPA Super Fund sites within the next 5 years.  Just kidding.  But lots of us r working hard to make sure the next president does this...
3211 2018-01-04 19:46:49 Are you nuts? What about the wildlife? Do we need the oil? Why aren’t you working on solar, wind & water power? They are all CLEAN powers. Stop killing the environment. Screw your donors and do what’s best for America.
3212 2018-01-04 19:46:49 My cars been in the shop for over 5 hours now man I just needed that oil changeeeee
3213 2018-01-04 19:46:41 Expansion of oil drilling off 90% of the US coastline is a catastrophic and out of touch proposal from the President that would have a devastating affect not just on our natural resources, but on our coastal economies. The future of this country is not oil.
3214 2018-01-04 19:46:38 The oil in the seed could be use like corn oil the hemp is so strong we can build homes roads bridges it is the fastest growing crop as well End it will practically grow anywhere how many jobs do you think it would create oh yeah and I can cure cancer as well
3215 2018-01-04 19:46:37 Someone do my oil change and I’ll buy you dinner 
3216 2018-01-04 19:46:34 Oil prices climb to another 3-year high
3217 2018-01-04 19:46:32 In other words, more money in your pocket from oil lobbyists and the oil industry pockets. 

Job's will be temporary at best.

If you half of a brain you'd know that the oil produced from offshore rigs will be sold outside of the US.
3218 2018-01-04 19:46:28 Especially when you know one ay them and go mental way the toppings and droon it in chilli oil.
3219 2018-01-04 19:46:27 Shit was real life just oil the other day before work 
3220 2018-01-04 19:46:22 obviously no one likes oil & gas spills, but oil & gas power our appliances, so it's always good to have more of it.

meanwhile is @schneiderman too afraid of @laurasparksny to enforce a consent decree he, at his sole discretion, signed off on? weaksauce.
3221 2018-01-04 19:46:19 Finally someone is talking about why the exchange rate too should move downward once the price of crude oil moves up and vice versa. The exchange rate shouldn't be stagnant.
3222 2018-01-04 19:46:16 By continuing to promote sales of oil. You continue to find the enemy directly. It's cannabis Jeff Sessions. When you figure that out you will see the truth. Grown men. Just can't get it right.
3223 2018-01-04 19:46:04 Dont trim oil it. Keep that bad boy going.
3224 2018-01-04 19:45:59 Nice jack! I also have oil and a fire place
3225 2018-01-04 19:45:57 Can someone please drill for oil on Trump and all GOP properties?
3226 2018-01-04 19:45:52 I'm never letting the Oil go no matter what. Been with the team since 1979. Can't imagine ever cheering for another team. They are pretty damn frustrating though sometimes. I get why people are getting upset.  - PB

3233 2018-01-04 19:45:15 Have you discussed the debate regarding parent essential oils - the omega 6/3 ratio and Brian Peskin's proposition against the intake of fish oil? I am having difficulty finding research to clarify/debunk his claims and my patients are being influenced to take his product.
3234 2018-01-04 19:45:12 I'd pour loads of oil in and ruin the whole point of having healthy chips Susan!

IF YOU'RE REPORTING ON OIL DRILLING YOU SHOULD ALSO REPORT ON GEOPHYSICAL SURVEYS IN THE ATLANTIC. THEY'RE IMPORTANT TOO.
3238 2018-01-04 19:44:57 do you think sophia the robot, siri, and cortana have fun girls nights? like going out to get their oil changed or flirting with the new macs at best buy or other cute stuff like that

3240 2018-01-04 19:44:56 W8, no garlic or oil?
3241 2018-01-04 19:44:56 Not sure how they were "right on the politics of ANWR." Elaborate? People care about fossil fuel/carbon extraction, not just oil spills/catastrophes.
3242 2018-01-04 19:44:55 寝るか
3243 2018-01-04 19:44:46 But if we all studied to become doctors and lawyers and engineers or worked On oil rigs...who would work at grocery stores, restaurants, become cleaners, these services are needed. People work hard at those jobs. They deserve to live above poverty line.
3244 2018-01-04 19:44:42 @foxnewspolitics Another Trump blunder, lets destroy our Government land be leasing it for Oil & Gas drilling, Trump is destroying America making it weaker day by day, China & Russia growning Stronger.
3245 2018-01-04 19:44:41 Exhausted other treatments? If so, get on the oil asap. You never know. Good luck with the trial
3246 2018-01-04 19:44:41 Your view is that any extraction of oil or gas from the earth counts as despoliation? Remarkable.
3247 2018-01-04 19:44:38 Companies can "temporarily" close down their wells for up to a year before permanently plugging. But lots are left plugged indefinitely--the offshore oil economy is bad right now in La, but some are waiting it out to see if offshore drilling gets profitable again.
3248 2018-01-04 19:44:34 I put garlic, basil and dried, minced onions in my Olive Oil, poor lass' quickie pesto, for dipping bread. #WillWorkForFreshPesto ...just saying
3249 2018-01-04 19:44:34 "On Thursday, the Interior Department suspended a study conducted by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine on the safety of offshore oil and gas drilling platforms." Why. Would. You. Stop. This?
3250 2018-01-04 19:44:25 Good no more mid East oil.

Low cost energy helps the poor more than anything.
3251 2018-01-04 19:44:24 And, in other news; retail area oil delivery shops are corruptly raising prices in an unlawful enrichment collusion scam.

3254 2018-01-04 19:44:13 When the price of commodity increases, the price of its byproduct will equally increase. As long as the crude oil keep increasing further than $68/barrel, no man or devil can make the landing cost of PMS stagnant. It will keep surging.
3255 2018-01-04 19:44:12 You do know that if we flood the market with new supply, oil prices will fall... if they fall far enough, smaller US wells will be forced to close, and jobs will be lost. Big oil’s  profits will be okay, though. That’s all that matter, right?
3256 2018-01-04 19:44:11 I'm confident you will support companies that are money hungry and ignore safety requirements for workers for greed! I've been there and seen that as a south Louisianian- I lost a friend in Deep Water Horizon...how about you restore the LA wetlands that this oil greed destroys???
3257 2018-01-04 19:44:09 Are your friends at ALEC, Heritage Foundation, & the Koch Brothers pleased at your continuing their agenda?  First the tax scam. Now oil drilling in the artic and offshore coastal regions. *Drill baby drill!*

Tell me something. Do you have ANY honor left? 

Didnt think so #shill
3258 2018-01-04 19:44:03 HC loves pipelines. Mother Jones expose. HC hid contractor ties 2 KXL. The State Dept environmental impact statement written not by State but an oil man hired by KXL. Article is still online. Simple google search brings it up.
3259 2018-01-04 19:44:03 You forgot “more of a chance that some accident will spill oil into another body of water.”
3260 2018-01-04 19:44:02 The jobs created by this announcement will primarily be in clean-up and mitigation of spills. Oil companies have proven time and again that they are incapable of extracting their resources without fouling up the area they are extracting from. Horrible idea.
3261 2018-01-04 19:44:00 Trump is a paid stooge for oil companies. May Trump and the GOP burn in HELL!
3262 2018-01-04 19:43:47 It means it's just a matter of time before the next devastating oil spill. You wanna save the planet? ---> #VoteNo to #GOP.  #VoteThemOut2018 -
3263 2018-01-04 19:43:47 Hi Kovacs. Unfortunately we are not going to be selling Green Oil products at this time but please send a DM so we can send you further information as it is too long for this comment.
3264 2018-01-04 19:43:42 Patent medicines were sometimes called snake oil because they included "Seneca oil" which was from oil seeps.
3265 2018-01-04 19:43:40 RT @Ed_Crooks: Opening up oil drilling in all federal waters is a big shift, not just from the Obama era, but from all administrations since Reagan. The last offshore lease sale for the east coast was in 1983, for the west coast in 1984
3266 2018-01-04 19:43:31 Put a little oil on your edges before you put whatever edge control on
3267 2018-01-04 19:43:21 Time for an oil change... oooh, lordy! ＼(＾O＾)／
3268 2018-01-04 19:43:20 Heaven forbid if they should ever have to check their oil or put air in a tire.
3269 2018-01-04 19:43:17 The heating oil ran out today so the theme is on going
3270 2018-01-04 19:43:12 The Trump Administration unveiled its proposed 5-year plan for offshore leasing today – which identifies territories that could ultimately be auctioned off to the fossil fuel industry for oil or gas drilling & exposes coastal communities to unacceptable harm.
3271 2018-01-04 19:43:11 Chef Louis cut up some bars of soap, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was 1000 rat corpses, along with Play-Doh.
3272 2018-01-04 19:43:09 To be the best industrial nation on earth it takes lots of energy ! To have price control of that energy it requires oil indenpendence from Rouge nations !
3273 2018-01-04 19:43:06 Now that statement would be a huge surprise for the Chinese who are currently fueling their pebble bed reactor and developing gen 4 reactors of various types. They know that nukes are the only tech that can replace coal/oil/gas.
3274 2018-01-04 19:42:57 I do - most use nut oil but you can always ask if unsure. Chips & curry sauce is another good high st snack and of course the vegan's friend the falafel
3275 2018-01-04 19:42:56 It MEANS MORE OIL SPILLS, LESS SAFETY, LESS RESPONSIBILITY ON THE PART OF THE OIL COMPANIES, and More Environmental Damage!
3276 2018-01-04 19:42:56 Paul, do you ever get tired of LYING? We DON'T have an oil shortage, we don't need to drill. You are serving 1% of our population.
3277 2018-01-04 19:42:55 @FLGovScott so your job is to make Florida # 1 in Job Creation??? Today in the daily briefing, White House, it was said that you are “concerned” about offshore oil drilling near Florida?? Oil drilling would create a multitude of jobs for Floridians!! Be quiet!! @realDonaldTrump
3278 2018-01-04 19:42:55 So....
1/2 cup popcorn kernels
2 tbsp butter
2 tbsp cooking oil
1/2 teaspoon flavacol

*waits at the door for the popping oil*
3279 2018-01-04 19:42:55 POTUS ought to require a 2 for 1 arrangement: For each oil benefit realized, two benefits of like value are realized in alternative energy. Time to double down on moving the US into the lead on alternative energy by making its usage ridiculously commercially feasible.
3280 2018-01-04 19:42:46 Just fry the little beggars in a bit of oil - it's peasy
3281 2018-01-04 19:42:45 It means more pollution, more oil spills and more climate change. Good job GOP!
3282 2018-01-04 19:42:45 Red hahahahahahahahaha...$tsla snake oil buyers everywhere
3283 2018-01-04 19:42:42 Since when is becoming energy self sufficient an assault on national security.  Do you prefer to continue to dependent on Middle Eastern & other foreign oil??? You don’t make much sense.
3284 2018-01-04 19:42:42 Renewable energy like solar & wind farms are the only way forward. Would create HUGE numbers of jobs if energy investments made in renewable energy. From basic low skill work in production & installation right through to highly trained engineers. Retrain miners & oil workers!
3285 2018-01-04 19:42:40 Coconut oil
3286 2018-01-04 19:42:35 So true and reagan battalion blocks everyone that calls them out. Sad. They can't take criticism. Thrive only in their echo chamber. Look at comments to their posts....Lots on left praising them and they love it. It's unfortunate.
3287 2018-01-04 19:42:34 There’s an ow everywhere but the god damned ski resorts
3288 2018-01-04 19:42:33 It is confirmed. Firefighters now believe the smoke was from an oil furnace that got flooded. No major fire, but family is now without heat
3289 2018-01-04 19:42:31 Can we lobby oil & gas companies to first start drilling in front of Mar-a-Lago's ocean views! Conservatives only care when they are directly affected!
3290 2018-01-04 19:42:26 Damn let them drill better us getting that oil than china
3291 2018-01-04 19:42:18 Came to get my oil changed and I met the coolest guy who moved here from New Hampshire about 10 years ago...for Skiing lol we talked non stop. Honestly one of the dopest people I’ve met in a while. I love meeting new people. I appreciate genuine interactions with good people.
3292 2018-01-04 19:42:09 All this energy talk: why don’t Potus and his cronies know that we are self sufficient in energy, and probably net exporters of oil and lng? Can’t any of them read?  Production reports are not redacted.
3293 2018-01-04 19:42:07 @LFFriedman :What is the point of  opening offshore oil when it's It's literally pissing out of frack holes worldwide
3294 2018-01-04 19:42:00 I was just talking to a buddy on here and I don’t know the exact percentage of the material. It’s alien OG so I would assume 19-20 percent. I use coconut oil and I use buds and small sugar leaves.  They def have a kick.
3295 2018-01-04 19:42:00 I like that oil painting :D
3296 2018-01-04 19:41:57 BACK TO THE PROJECTS WHERE YOU HUNG JESUS OIL PAINTING AS YOUR FAMILY..LOL LOL
3297 2018-01-04 19:41:52 someone should oil spill on your house
3298 2018-01-04 19:41:47 How many use an EZ form and just pay the going rate or cut an extra check to Treasury? 
Can you find even 1?
3299 2018-01-04 19:41:46 Even the Saudi’s r moving away from oil. We have become Mordor.
3300 2018-01-04 19:41:44 The price of oil last 2.5-year high
3301 2018-01-04 19:41:44 Fuck ya!  More oil spills to look forward to my kids having to clean up!  Keep hydrogen, solar, and wind in the way back seat where that pesky clean energy belongs!  More lobby donations from big oil for the @GOP!  God fucking bless ‘Merica!
3302 2018-01-04 19:41:29 Day 4 of #Veganuary and I’ve already had a snaccident! - an Alpen Light cereal bar containing milk and palm oil 

On the plus side, apart from the one slip-up, I’m doing pretty well to get this far! :)

@WeAreVeganuary 
3303 2018-01-04 19:41:28 Woah it's so amazing  do you use oil paint or acrylic 
3304 2018-01-04 19:41:26 Lakin sprayed rose hip oil into my eye at Whole Foods so honestly how much more natural can you get
3305 2018-01-04 19:41:23 What does coffee and oil have in common? They're both fuel. 
3306 2018-01-04 19:41:22 Always easy to see where Scaramucci has been. Just follow the oil slick.
3307 2018-01-04 19:41:14 I love the face people make when I tell them I put butter and oil in my coffee 
3308 2018-01-04 19:41:09 Horrible pandering to big oil at the expense of our environment - I hope we can recover from republican actions when you are gone.
3309 2018-01-04 19:41:09 Have tried everything Joyce... Because I have hypertension. Can't be prescribed anything... Just good dose olbas oil on hanky... Just running steamy bath now... So hopefully
3310 2018-01-04 19:41:03 @RealDonad_Trump how unbelievably stupid narrow-minded and feckless does a person have to be to sell our oil while market prices are low so we'll nave to buy foreign oil when prices are high. And you call yourself a businessman?
3311 2018-01-04 19:41:01 I really need this oil please
3312 2018-01-04 19:40:54 Rose hip oil  yessssssss. 

And yeah i can feel the feeling just from seeing that photo though. I do not miss that. My forehead would break out when i was younger pretty bad. Especially when i got bangs 
3313 2018-01-04 19:40:49 I lowkey missed changing oil 
3314 2018-01-04 19:40:47 The Trump base is located in area where an oil spill would have little impact on their lives. As one Trump supporter told me .”We can’t power bombers with solar power or wind. We need oil to fight a war”
3315 2018-01-04 19:40:46 Beautiful..been chopping heads off religious dissidents, forcing them into cauldrons of boiling oil, etc., for a long time..ask some Sikhs, Hindus, or Christian victims  - oh, that's right, we can't.
3316 2018-01-04 19:40:41 If you don't enjoy bread dipped in oil with seasonings and balsamic we can't be friends
3317 2018-01-04 19:40:39 And what next?  Arctic expeditions by trumpers to club baby seals?    

My guess is the oil is slotted for export,  anyway.  There's no such thing as an "energy superpower."  A dump,  there's such a thing as a dump.
3318 2018-01-04 19:40:39 Trump admin to allow expanded offshore oil & gas exploration & drilling. This decision will lead to more jobs for hard-working Louisianians anxious to return to work and provide greater economic stimulation in our communities that rely on energy production for survival. #LA05
3319 2018-01-04 19:40:38 Ya.. that sucks. Its hard to guess which conflict that resulted in his death. Its sad that dirty wars are killing our soldiers instead of direct threat wars. Remember.. it was never about oil right?
3320 2018-01-04 19:40:36 @jimrome I'm addicted to patchouli oil. Regards, Portland Woman
3321 2018-01-04 19:40:34 Not even officially started #slimmingworld yet, just doing a trial run until group on saturday, and already lost 5lb. Winner. Proper missing oil though *glug*
3322 2018-01-04 19:40:32 100 million acres offshore along Atlantic seaboard now open for oil and gas drilling. Source: @nytimes and others
3323 2018-01-04 19:40:29 Trump can't do more than one thing at a time. Big money is burning the midnight oil and checking off each item on their long awaited dreams will come true list. Trump and GOP are just disposable conduits at their service.
3324 2018-01-04 19:40:28 We can't even get legal medical marijuana, only the oil. When my other aunt was dying with cancer and was already so skinny and lost her appetite, her doctor told me to get pot and put it in her food. He put me in contact with someone to get it from.
3325 2018-01-04 19:40:28 I didn't realize my last oil change place filled me up with the junk stuff that freezes, so I periodically have to clean the windshield off with snow...Pretty funny when you think about it.
3326 2018-01-04 19:40:25 1. Six episodes should not be allowed to be called a season.
2. I’m going to forget everything by the time 2019 gets here.
3327 2018-01-04 19:40:24 This man done told me “come on get on my back I’ll go rub your ankle down with hot oil” you know what 
3328 2018-01-04 19:40:09 Bob, are you willing to let the Sunni vs. Shia anger potentially create havoc with Americans on gas prices? Many power companies use oil and you are against cheap coal---so what is your long range solution for America's power needs??
3329 2018-01-04 19:40:08 Never burn the oil, when you do is time to get out @elonmusk
3330 2018-01-04 19:40:08 オススメデッキください #lov3 #lovfan
3331 2018-01-04 19:40:05 Not to mention the clean-up after you fuck this all up and pollute the ocean with oil. I guess the silver lining in that as far as you're concerned will be more jobs as well.
3332 2018-01-04 19:39:55 My 401 k is up 12% since Trump was elected. It just rocketed up again since tax cuts. Deduction doubled to $24,000( from 12,400) and child tax credit doubled. You are a snake oil salesman. You are slowly being debunked and come February it will be clear to all.
3333 2018-01-04 19:39:53 Cut your potatoes, rinse them and then dry off excess water, bit of oil and then approx 30 mins, they need to be dry x
3334 2018-01-04 19:39:42 So you are claiming @RonDeSantisFL is against @realDonaldTrump's plan to expand oil drilling? 
3335 2018-01-04 19:39:41 So I’m letting my hair air dry with no product and just oil 
3336 2018-01-04 19:39:35 Im getting an oil change and it’s a 2 hour wait someone pick me up and hang out w me 
3337 2018-01-04 19:39:32 Simple oil of cloves...
3338 2018-01-04 19:39:26 Sell your snake oil elsewhere. We know this is ultimately for the rich to get richer.
3339 2018-01-04 19:39:19 LOL that's your retort.
3340 2018-01-04 19:39:08 Trump is a paid stooge for the oil companies! Impeach this monster!
3341 2018-01-04 19:39:06 Cleaning oil off of seals creates jobs?
3342 2018-01-04 19:39:04 Sarah Sanders on the President’s decision to open up off-shore oil drilling: “Our goal isn’t to cross Governor Scott.”
Says the Admin still hope to work with Scott on the issue. @CBSMiami
3343 2018-01-04 19:38:45 more oil spills off the gulf then
3344 2018-01-04 19:38:44 After you get an oil change your car be driving so mf good lol
3345 2018-01-04 19:38:40 Great video, Wild! I haven’t been able to find any info on people using this product, but there is a medium called Lukas Medium #7 which supposedly is made to add to traditional oil colors to make them water mixable. Not sure if it works or not though.
3346 2018-01-04 19:38:32 Would be happy to see the evidence for a recipe for olive oil soap in use before the Islamic era. I am glad to change my mind if I am wrong.
3347 2018-01-04 19:38:30 Great news when the next oil spills kills massive amount of wildlife. What do you care? You got tax breaks for the rich and a mansion in the suburbs.
3348 2018-01-04 19:38:27 Not only that.. My father made sure i knew how to change a flat on my own and how to do my own oil change . oregon is hysterical omg
3349 2018-01-04 19:38:25 @Lenin @navasveracesar @FiscaliaEcuador @ppsesa Conciesa de Carlos Humberto Viteri Andrade dueño de CONCIESA y OIL SERVICES de los Hnos Baquerizos en la refineria de PetroEcuador, se coimo a Funcionarios, intername te se toca este tema, no mas corrupcion. Ya no mas
3350 2018-01-04 19:38:24 مثلك والله
3351 2018-01-04 19:38:23 Calm down haha! And rotate them everytime you get oil changed. Sorry mama Mary here 
3352 2018-01-04 19:38:18 He is trying to save his skin by paying off the oil barons.
3353 2018-01-04 19:38:18 Subsidizing any business, including current practice of Big Oil, is wrong. And you're talking to someone who doesn't believe taxes as a solution. Govt is the biggest polluter, so downsizing, especially what the military does, would do far more good than assessing another tax
3354 2018-01-04 19:38:16 We biafran appreciate you,the killings is too much for God sake but i don't know why the#EU #Aunion #UN  is keeping quiet on this atrocities been committed by murderers #nigeriagovt and military against #Biafrans people,Britishgovt have vowed to kill biafran people because of oil
3355 2018-01-04 19:38:14 A drawdown in oil inventories & Trump administration opening up oil fields for new drilling is bullish for the energy sector and this is reflected in the recent up move in $OIL stocks... $XLE
3356 2018-01-04 19:38:14 I thinks depends on the source. To give a more "painted" style try with the special FX  tab "oil paint" and a bit of sharpen to fix too much smoothness
3357 2018-01-04 19:38:04 And guns and oil drilling and a lot of other stuff....
3358 2018-01-04 19:38:04 Same as us geordies lol, sinus is awful hv u tried eucalyptus oil in oil burner xx
3359 2018-01-04 19:38:03 Hey! All the people fired from AT&T and Macys can just work on an oil rig!
3360 2018-01-04 19:38:02 COW　Crude Oil Washing 原油洗浄
3361 2018-01-04 19:37:58 Never used an air fryer.  I go old school.  A deep pan and cooking oil.  Gotta get them extra crunchy.
3362 2018-01-04 19:37:52 Why there are so many tweets about The Fault In Our Stars tonight? I can't handle these feelings. I need to drink some motor oil while arm wrestling a grizzly bear just to feel manly again
3363 2018-01-04 19:37:52 We love you enjoy our wine La Boscana there 
3364 2018-01-04 19:37:49 More oil spills, more cleanups, less solar reliance or wind or hydro.  Such shortsighted stupidity.  You can't keep relying on fossil fuel.  1. It's gonna run out; 2. It's killing the planet.
3365 2018-01-04 19:37:48 Means less sulfur pollution from oil tankers transporting oil from Middle East to Texas.
3366 2018-01-04 19:37:44 Arh ok so we used 5 coats of teak oil and the first four mixed with white spirit! 80/20 60/40 40/60 20/80 then 100% 
3367 2018-01-04 19:37:32 Same forecast for oil. Any substitute ? Seems hard to be replaced. Cocoa is irreplaceable...
3368 2018-01-04 19:37:32 @ImperialOil Who do we make complaints to about your retail operations in Ontario?  I understand your retail gasoline stations are no longer part of Imperial Oil corporate.  Please advise.  Thank you.
3369 2018-01-04 19:37:30 50 years from now sure. But pretending there’s not a public interest in securing American oil production in the meantime instead of relying on Russia/Venezuela/Saudi is, you know, insane.
3370 2018-01-04 19:37:28 So when can the oil rig right next to Mar-a-logo be built?
3371 2018-01-04 19:37:23 Q: Offshore oil drilling. Can #Trump afford to cross Gov Scott?

#SHSanders: We have a great relationship with Gov Scott. 

For now

#Briefing
3372 2018-01-04 19:37:17 And more oil spills.  Destroying the environment and assuring our dependence on fossil fuel. Why don’t you take the money and invest in solar farms and more wind power.
3373 2018-01-04 19:37:11 Deloitte predicts demand for Canadian oil will likely rise this year due to shrinking volumes from Mexico and Venezuela, opens up new opportunities to sell to U.S.; forecasts avg. price of WTI US$55 per barrel in 2018, up from US$50.84 in 2017, #cdnpoli #yyc #abpoli
3374 2018-01-04 19:37:00 I was skeptical about the coconut oil but even a tiny bit really changes the texture. I guess it might emulsify the suspended powder.
3375 2018-01-04 19:36:59 I remember when a bunch of states sued to keep one of the oil refineries based in Indiana from dumping toxic wastes into Lake Michigan, which had been OK'd by the IN gov at the time. Mitch Daniels?  GOP of course. @LisaMadigan, here's another lawsuit you'll be filing.
3376 2018-01-04 19:36:59 Because who cares about the planet and huge oil spills when there’s alternative energy and forward thinking?!
3377 2018-01-04 19:36:50 Nuclear winter is a myth - the Kuwait oil fields burning in 1991 debunked it - but I agree with the rest of your tweet
3378 2018-01-04 19:36:44 Ooh. A question about the offshore oil drilling movement that Trump reversed. #PressBriefing
3379 2018-01-04 19:36:43 Chard was indeed wonderful this evening but grumble grumble I burnt the garlic that went in the oil for then sautéing 
3380 2018-01-04 19:36:42 Lmao na oil rig
3381 2018-01-04 19:36:33 Bring back our Oil & Gas Industry.  Make US Energy Independent!! #MAGA
3382 2018-01-04 19:36:33 Somebody picked today of all days to deliver heating oil to my building.  Now I’m trapped by the weather in an apartment that smells like oil.
3383 2018-01-04 19:36:32 Add it to a carrier oil of your choice
3384 2018-01-04 19:36:27 Palm oil is the major ingredient?!

There are times when I wish that protected names applied to generic food types
3385 2018-01-04 19:36:26 Oil can u plants make a video cuz u haven't made one in like 2 months and I am physically desperate for a new vid
3386 2018-01-04 19:36:21 Now is the best time to start an Oil Spill Clean Up business.
3387 2018-01-04 19:36:20 Renewable sustainable energy exists (Solar  Wind Geothermal ). It’s more affordable long term too. When will corporations stop environmental malfeasance? Water in Houston & Galveston’s Gulf of Mexico still dirty from BP’s oil spill & chemical spills in hurricane Harvey!
3388 2018-01-04 19:36:07 You know what is an even better thing? Quit giving subsidies to oil companies and use them to expand green energy production. We already have all the oil we need in reserves.
3389 2018-01-04 19:36:06 Y’all be putting mah oil in y’all hair and making it stick together like that shit helps your damaged hair look less fucked. It looks nasty and lifeless. Stop stringy.
3390 2018-01-04 19:35:51 1) oh my god lush just tweeted me I’m DEAD 2) Jason and the argon oil! It’s doing wonders for my curly hair, was going to try a conditioner bar, any suggestions?
3391 2018-01-04 19:35:51 I think even people who live with periodic flooding in LA don’t understand what’s coming. LA is sinking faster than prev thought, weather getting more intense/sea level rising, and losing coastline& barrier islands in the Gulf of Mex due to oil ex and hurricanes.
3392 2018-01-04 19:35:43 Coconut oil is very versatile.
3393 2018-01-04 19:35:42 Meh.

I'd couch climate policies as creating resilience to oil price spikes, favoring American products with lower shipping costs, and cutting reliance on and funding of oil-rich kingdoms and dictatorships most Americans don't wish to be in bed with.
3394 2018-01-04 19:35:39 Omg I need to go get my oil changed already
3395 2018-01-04 19:35:39 @thechew To reduce inflammation, don’t fry your salmon in Olive Oil! Try Avocado Oil or butter. Save the Olive Oil for dressings & cold stuff....
3396 2018-01-04 19:35:39 I make my own. I make a turmeric and pepper paste for about 2 weeks and keep it in the fridge. Then I combine warm milk, paste, honey, and a pea-size coconut oil bit.
3397 2018-01-04 19:35:38 Eggs, Olive oil and honey deep condition day!
3398 2018-01-04 19:35:35 Someone call them at GoYa headquarters that it’s no cooking oil, but Anointing oil for deliverance over here
3399 2018-01-04 19:35:31 Same issue at MTN Junction before Oil Mill. They harass people in the name of selling phones. It's very wrong
3400 2018-01-04 19:35:29 Try to mix it with something thick like black castor oil, I mixed some of that with rosemary now it’s some heat lol
3401 2018-01-04 19:35:25 Cheaper gas prices. If you complain, then you don't live in L.A. We need it more than any other state because we're the auto capital of the nation, and we rely heavily in oil.
3402 2018-01-04 19:35:22 Bahi makes beard oil now 
3403 2018-01-04 19:35:19 everyone is talking about offshore drilling but why do we not try onshore drilling where we take the oil we get offshore and put it back into the ground onshore
3404 2018-01-04 19:35:08 Nothing says 'progress' like dead birds covered in oil...tourists love them...
3405 2018-01-04 19:34:55 Great so with an abundance of oil and having finally gotten somewhat on top of protecting waterways and habitats, and our environmental responsibilities, Trump first thought was to destroy safety regulations and drill and disrupt protected waterways - Trump mentally unfit
3406 2018-01-04 19:34:54 I mean that is the main character’s job. 

(Also it’s set on an oil rig off the coast of Labrador so maybe you’ve mixed it up with something else)

3409 2018-01-04 19:34:48 When he delivers an explanation about why he refused to disclose his taxes, that will be the day I'll believe he's not another snake oil salesman like Trump.
3410 2018-01-04 19:34:46 I put one to two drops of lavender oil in a spray bottle with water or when I wash clothes to get the scent
3411 2018-01-04 19:34:41 Opening up oil drilling in all federal waters is a big shift, not just from the Obama era, but from all administrations since Reagan. The last offshore lease sale for the east coast was in 1983, for the west coast in 1984
3412 2018-01-04 19:34:39 Why? Money money money money money! Because oil is at the end of its life cycle, it's critical they squeeze every last dime out of it any way they can as quickly as they can.
3413 2018-01-04 19:34:20 Wait oooo, it is aiteo that is sponsoring this year mot Glo.

Gbogbo Oil money from PH. 
3414 2018-01-04 19:34:19 I know, I just don't like seeing license plates like "Off Oil" & "No Gas", when I know that Gas/Oil charged the battery of the car... But yes, the future is coming.
3415 2018-01-04 19:34:17 Thanks oil shill. You and @EPAScottPruitt should be dunked in vats of oil.
3416 2018-01-04 19:34:12 Corporations and people Dump chemicals , garbage and used oil in streams
3417 2018-01-04 19:34:06 the mood for 2018 - oil chic (like oil sheikh but chic-er)
3418 2018-01-04 19:34:04 uhh i think its oil free pink grapefruit by neutrogena
3419 2018-01-04 19:34:01 Gotta you 
3420 2018-01-04 19:33:55 Listen this cold weather is causing me to lather my face in coconut oil every night and I can’t keep buying a new jar every week
3421 2018-01-04 19:33:49 Addicted to basil, cilantro and ginger...just not all at the same time And I like to use Olive Oil as a dip or dribble, in place of say, butter. #vegan 
3422 2018-01-04 19:33:44 Your hate will cause people to suffer In Bible times people were anointed with oil to signify gods blessing or call on that person's life. #Exodus 29:7. A lot of times the oil used contained Thc.
3423 2018-01-04 19:33:33 My favourite essential oil is the most expensive. 
3424 2018-01-04 19:33:33 Every 3 months I change it on the day I get my oil changed and tires rotated so it's all in the same day can't mess it up
3425 2018-01-04 19:33:28 Apple cider vinegar diluted with water and coconut oil to moisturize. Then I have the coffee scrub from lush he uses as needed but his pores are already smaller and his skin isn’t oily and he hasn’t had a breakout in weeks
3426 2018-01-04 19:33:28 i put peppermint oil on my temples bc i have a headache and then i went pee forgetting i have peppermint oil on my hands 10/10 donmt recommend
3427 2018-01-04 19:33:17 You deep fry them in vegetable oil
3428 2018-01-04 19:33:13 I didn’t restrict my argument to oil. As for alternatives, Obama promised millions of high paying “green jobs” He talked the talk but didn’t deliver because he focused on his real agenda. We’ve extracting oil for over a century. We can do it responsibly.
3429 2018-01-04 19:33:02 What has he done towards that action in the past two years he has been oil minister? He could only shout at been sidelined in a $25 billion  contract. Liar
3430 2018-01-04 19:33:00 Yeah that happens for sure just don’t over wash and definitely get a moisturizer if you don’t have oily based skin coconut oil does wonders for dry skin ! && You’re welcome!
3431 2018-01-04 19:32:56 The cultivation of olive oil and uses, ceremonial, food, cosmetic. There is the error of taking for granted that the Arabs did this or that, when in most cases they were not Arabs and there were already previous knowledge.
There are many examples, I think this is another.
3432 2018-01-04 19:32:43 I’m with you bro. I’ll never go back. That’s what a get for having them give me an oil change in first place.
3433 2018-01-04 19:32:38 I thought we were going back to the moon for the helium3. Why do we need more oil?
3434 2018-01-04 19:32:38 @tacobelluk is it only the Southampton Store where the vegetarian food is cooked in the same oil as meat products. This vile practice contaminates the food. Why haven't you given a suitable response to questions asked about this? Do all your branches do this? #boycottTacoBellUK
3435 2018-01-04 19:32:38   I know right!
3436 2018-01-04 19:32:36 Hillary us busy burning their houses. Lmbo
3437 2018-01-04 19:32:35 Trump administration aims to open nearly all US offshore waters to drilling |  http://www
Drill baby drill, Under Trump will be world’s biggest east exporter of oil...
Europe will not have to fear Russia
America energy independent
3438 2018-01-04 19:32:17 plus why bother when oil's at 60 dollars?
3439 2018-01-04 19:32:16 @realDonaldTrump proposed opening up the ocean for oil drilling, I’m gonna do everything in my power to make sure that his wrinkly orange minuscule hands stay away from what I hold dearest
3440 2018-01-04 19:32:15 If he's mentally unstable, at least he won't try to incite political violence in a major oil producing State merely to cause instability in the markets and increase the price of oil, in which he holds investments.
3441 2018-01-04 19:32:14 In-n-Out’s new Hot Chocolate is prepared using 100% trans-fat free, cholesterol-free vegetable oil.
3442 2018-01-04 19:32:10 You should really make a statement and stop using oil altogether. No more driving. No flying. Stop using plastics. Be a man for the cause.
3443 2018-01-04 19:32:04 Hab gerade ein Essential Oil benutzt und rieche jetzt einfach nach dem Wald. Hach, wie wunderbar.
3444 2018-01-04 19:32:03 Trust me...Sessions is not going after medicating oil users.  He’s creating a step around Cali sanctuary city issue.  You won’t see a lot of charges but you might see a lot of deportations.  It’s genius!
3445 2018-01-04 19:31:45 #Oil climbed from the highest in 3 years as optimism on the global economy, cold weather & political unrest bolstered the market + crude is having its best start to a year since 2012, after hitting $62/bbl in NY #OOTT #energy
3446 2018-01-04 19:31:44 My dad asked to borrow my car for the weekend. I said sureeee , but I want a full tank , car wash , and a oil change hoping he would say nvm... and he said “ok” 
3447 2018-01-04 19:31:43 You may be ignorant then. There is not an infinite supply of oil. Fracking is getting the dregs. We should be focused on renewable energy.
3448 2018-01-04 19:31:42 We are not, we are actually producing and excess which is why there has been a push to let us export more oil
3449 2018-01-04 19:31:38 my friend went to one and they didn't put the oil drain plug in right and all his oil leaked out and he almost blew the engine.
3450 2018-01-04 19:31:38 Any peeps in the now about the oil prices out there, why has it gone up?
3451 2018-01-04 19:31:35 And when should they come back for the other two?
3452 2018-01-04 19:31:34 This is one of my favourite drawings of yours. It looks classical, as if it were an oil painting made years ago. It shows off your style incredibly well. The tweaks you've made have really made a difference!
3453 2018-01-04 19:31:34 Just got some coconut oil AND cocoa butter shampoo/conditioner and man my hair is fabuloso
3454 2018-01-04 19:31:29 Have you mixed it with a carrier oil?
3455 2018-01-04 19:31:28 5 january. 0321. It's raining. From far, we can see a group of students currently burning the midnight oil to study for their final exam. For them, the sound of the rain is like a lullaby.

3458 2018-01-04 19:31:05 idk but if u eat coconut oil it stops cramps and lightens/shortens it xo
3459 2018-01-04 19:31:05 Though some will still sell themselves for cups of rice and a bottle of oil

3461 2018-01-04 19:30:59 Because a lot of them sniff about for high paying jobs that are positions with or sympathetic to the liberal party. The oil for the big red machine.
3462 2018-01-04 19:30:58 Today @realDonaldTrump proposed opening nearly all U.S. offshore waters to #oil & #gas drilling, reversing protections in the #Arctic, #Atlantic & #Pacific #OOTT
3463 2018-01-04 19:30:56 "I have some oil blotting sheets because my friends are oily and nasty"
3464 2018-01-04 19:30:48 Idk I’ve tried it and if smells bother you, the scent of the oil is super strong and I can’t handle it. It’s SUUUUUPER hydrating though and a little goes a long way. I suggest using it for nighttime
3465 2018-01-04 19:30:47 Next step is whale hunting for oil 
3466 2018-01-04 19:30:46 I’d like a tall glass of water please...ummmm, and hold the oil!
3467 2018-01-04 19:30:40 You can drive up to like 100 miles on low oil (light on) but if you wnat, just add like a quart of oil until ypu get it changed. Itll be like 8 bucks
3468 2018-01-04 19:30:33 That is why God your God has annointed you with the oil of exultation more than your companions. Psalm 45:7b
3469 2018-01-04 19:30:29 OIL DIFF: 6.28 -> 6.41

3471 2018-01-04 19:30:25 It’s also a very powerful motoring and oil industry that hasn’t quite yet harnessed a way to make money out of cycling. Once they do, the narrative will change.
3472 2018-01-04 19:30:24 I for one was weary of that Hugo Chavez person, especially when VZ was offering low cost heating oil to the US.  I don’t know about ‘rebranding’ but TRUE socialism which exists NOWHERE doesn’t cause such failures of government. People do.
3473 2018-01-04 19:30:22 If you got a car n you cant pump gas why da hell is you driving dat mean you cant change a tire or put oil in yo car....thats yo car....not mines i dont pay yo note or insurance
3474 2018-01-04 19:30:19 In terms of shrinking tumours? Impossible to tell as I've done loads of chemo. My response to treatment was as they said "miraculous" I can't help but think the oil helped this. My liver tumours got obliterated, and can no longer see bowel tumour

3480 2018-01-04 19:29:57 Dept of Interior's 5-year plan expands offshore drilling in US coastal waters; plan offers 90% of US Outer Continental Shelf to drillers (vs 6% available prior) This opens up oil & gas exploration in federal waters off the coast of Ca., Arctic,  East Coast from Maine to GA
3481 2018-01-04 19:29:48 Have an issue with oily hair? Pay close attention to the products you use! (Ex. Styling gels) Make sure they say "greaseless" or "oil free"

3484 2018-01-04 19:29:44 Illegal invasions & taking control of Nations oil reserves is bringing 'democracy'. Western foreign policy for  minof 15 years is directly responsible for Refugee crisis. French and British Imperialism of Muslim countries means bigger Muslim populations. It's not rocket science.
3485 2018-01-04 19:29:42 Oil change time...
3486 2018-01-04 19:29:39 Don’t pull that one. I know it’s CG because there’s not enough oil on the floor!
3487 2018-01-04 19:29:33 Oh, yes, it's definitely concerning. And of course, this could have all been avoided. But so far no one's bitten at Arctic drilling, and the long-term prognosis for oil isn't good.
3488 2018-01-04 19:29:30 In case you've nothing on your mind President Trump just opened nearly all US coasts to drilling for oil.
3489 2018-01-04 19:29:20 I switched to new fish oil and new probiotics and now I have all of the sushi burps and none of the sushi. I think I'm being targetted by the (((Deep State))).

3492 2018-01-04 19:29:01 Growing up in era only thing females were supposed 2 do was marry & have children. Only acceptable work-nurse or teacher. Enjoyed being able 2 pump own gas ( except when in formal dress); check & change oil, filters, hoses, tires & flush radiator. Last car fixed carberator.
3493 2018-01-04 19:28:59 Great news means getting closer to energy independence which improves national security more jobs cheap gas for my F150 Hasn’t been a big off shore oil disaster since BP blew up a rig during Obama’s time drill baby drill 
3494 2018-01-04 19:28:48 @canadiancynic  On the oil patch, employee of contracted company to oil company, we pay half our benefits. Bank hours for three months to qualify. Any hours over a limit or beyond three months drop off. Minimum hours needed to qualify for benefits & no refund.

3499 2018-01-04 19:28:32 For those that don’t know. When we had full service gas stations in Southern CA the attendant would pump the gas, check the tire pressure, clean the windshield, and check the oil. They would also give directions when needed and we would tip them. #news #truth

3502 2018-01-04 19:28:11 Donny-why would you cut regulations minimizing off shore oil drilling when we have plenty of oil? Any spills off shore impact not only the humans, but all animals using the ocean.  What is your problem? Why are you such a jerk?
3503 2018-01-04 19:28:09 Californians don't want this assault on our Pacific environment either, but unless the courts stop this Trump will continue with his determined ignorant pursuit of crude oil WE DON'T NEED.  Wind, solar, geothermal, hydropower, biofuel & other 21st century technologies. THATS ALL

3512 2018-01-04 19:26:59 It's now clear to everyone -that the opportunity presented by the period of low oil price was wasted by this government.
3513 2018-01-04 19:26:58 I also painted three of the walls midnight blue And the bottom half of the fourth and in oil pastel drew a sunset and an anime character and mounted an old school NES. A black light, two stobe lights, and some of those thick, hard plastic glow in the dark stars... I miss my room.
3514 2018-01-04 19:26:42 Yeah gotta get that oil before electric gets popular.
3515 2018-01-04 19:26:39 We are only nation in the world that keeps of its offshore energy resources off-limits. When the oil market is doing well, the entire country begins to benefit from jobs and enhance our national security. It’s past time to take advantage of this tremendous American opportunity.
3516 2018-01-04 19:26:35 Kids who have uncontrollable seizures used medicinal oil that doesn’t have THC in it and it reduces the seizures drastically. It’s technically weed just doesn’t have thc in it

3522 2018-01-04 19:26:17 They've almost got over their current colds, please don't infect them, I can't deal with any more snot or bloody olbas oil 
3523 2018-01-04 19:26:13 The Trump administration announced it is planning to dramatically expand offshore drilling, opening almost all U.S. coastal waters to potential oil and gas exploration and development

3525 2018-01-04 19:26:11 Jayce probably be thinking in his head “mom why you got all this oil on my body and hair and I ain’t going nowhereeeeee” lmao gotta be moisturized 
3526 2018-01-04 19:26:03 Perhaps that's why they said in Gadda Masjid in Jammalamadugu, that in olden days, the Kings would clap and the oil lanterns would come to light. But the jinns are, perhaps, no more and those days are long gone.
3527 2018-01-04 19:25:35 Welp time to buy these oil company stocks bro @teamASAP
3528 2018-01-04 19:25:35 Hi if you don’t put oil in your car and drive it when it’s chugging more than Thomas the fucking tank engine, you break your engine 

Thought you should all know
3529 2018-01-04 19:25:32 Canola, is that rapeseed oil?
3530 2018-01-04 19:25:31 This Press Secretary stands every day and repeats Trumps Lies, why do we have to listen to lies and lies and more lies. Why doesn't she talk about the Arctic wild life they are trying to open for oil companies?
3531 2018-01-04 19:25:31 Neither the courts, nor direct action, can stop oil cos. from drilling offshore -- or anywhere. What they really want is to lock in the RIGHT to future drilling , but only if oil prices are high enough to make it pay. The only answer is keep oil prices low. #AlternativeFuels
3532 2018-01-04 19:25:27 Why would he care? None of his golf courses would be in jeopardy if there was an oil spill. :/
3533 2018-01-04 19:25:24 @KwikFitCS getting a change oil message when I start my car. I’m confused as I had a full service late Nov 17 which includes an oil change. Has something been forgotten?
3534 2018-01-04 19:25:17 My first college boyfriend was a Virgo and nigga. Oil and water. U ever met a couple that actually hated each other but stayed together for years? Lmao
3535 2018-01-04 19:25:02 BUT OIL PRICES ARE HIGHER
3536 2018-01-04 19:24:49 Thanks a lot. New take:
"Emissions and #ClimateChange from exported Norwegian/American oil and gas are not Norway/USA's responsibility. This is btw great for our industry! Jobs! Environment!"

You others pay. If problem, you pay more. We call this #ClimateJustice.
3537 2018-01-04 19:24:48 I been putting this oil change off but I really have to get one before I get on the road.
3538 2018-01-04 19:24:47 We can NOT let this happen... they keep trying.. just remember the BP oil spill and say NO to drilling!
3539 2018-01-04 19:24:39 @SportsMT oil and gas.
3540 2018-01-04 19:24:34 U.S. government moves to expand oil and gas drilling on the US sea shelf. 47 lease sales are proposed: 19 for Alaska shelf, 12 for the Gulf of Mexico. 
(Following the Deepwater Horizon disaster, 2010, the Obama administration issued a series of offshore drilling moratoriums)
3541 2018-01-04 19:24:33 Does anyone have a garage that I can change my oil and battery in this weekend?
3542 2018-01-04 19:24:24 Apperently an oil change takes 45 minutes, so I'll start the stream whenever it's done and I get home. Sorry about the delay!

Tell me something. Do you have ANY honor left? 

Didnt think so #shill
3552 2018-01-04 19:23:36 "but seriously are you gonna use that oil or what?"

3555 2018-01-04 19:23:28 and something about an oil line through Turkey and about not being dependent on the Saudis for oil and about taking that power away from them which they hold over the world and the USA being able to use their own oil and become self sufficient. One side of the NWO collapses. 
3556 2018-01-04 19:23:26 . Lower taxes in California...
3557 2018-01-04 19:23:15 Did they not learn their lesson from what happened in the Gulf.  Just another oil spill away from an ecological disaster that cost millions to clean and destroy fishery/local Business.

3559 2018-01-04 19:23:03 My dude asked me why I take so damn long in the shower its because I’m exfoliating , then washing , applying oil , rinsing and washing again  then on to my face I have a special face pad and a process for that as well not to mention I get one off before I step out
3560 2018-01-04 19:23:00 Anything > Burps after fish oil
3561 2018-01-04 19:22:57 Lol! When I used it alone in place of a moisturizer, my skin was clearing up but it was dry! So now I mix it with another oil but it doesn’t work as well with it 
3562 2018-01-04 19:22:52 One of the things I can't get on board with when it comes to Slimming World is that it encourages swapping to low-cal oil sprays (with added crap in) and sugar-free drinks (again, full of crap).

I'd rather have quality olive oil, proper butter and regular drinks in moderation.
3563 2018-01-04 19:22:49 Absolutely.
Did you know that in some states with legal medical marijuana the only type you can get is marijuana oil, they don't want dying patients to enjoy the kick of smoking a real joint.
Oil takes longer to take effect and is unpalatable to use
That is big Pharmas input
3564 2018-01-04 19:22:47 Depends which industry the corporation is in. If it's excavating natural resources like coal or oil they don't care about global warming. Other companies just go green for PR purposes and don't really try as hard as they should, but over promote the little they do.
3565 2018-01-04 19:22:45 Haven’t seen any interest on your part for infrastructure just more destruction.  Refusing money to fix Amtrak tunnels, looking for more oil spills.  Nasty little man.
3566 2018-01-04 19:22:43 It doesn't have to be either or. It can and is both. 

In fact you can't have wind or solar without oil.
3567 2018-01-04 19:22:36 LOL...the best thing ever is @DrBronner coconut oil. Anytime you have a craving of any kind..take like a half a teaspoon.

3570 2018-01-04 19:22:28 Unfortunately it’ll be an oil company raking in the $$$ and not our government.
3571 2018-01-04 19:22:23 Dear Mr. President and AJ Sessions, Marijuana is not a gateway drug to opioids. I repeat, it is not a gateway drug to harder drugs! I Personally use a CBD oil that I purchase  locally and it has no side effects that prescribed rx have. My Dr. concurs.#marijuana
3572 2018-01-04 19:22:17 More proof that big oil has his back...truly pathetic...does not care for the environment at all only about the "now" money...
3573 2018-01-04 19:22:16 Well that’s not a big deal. Nothing bad ever happens when we drill for oil.
3574 2018-01-04 19:22:16 This is actually a good thing folks. Becoming less and less dependent on foreign oil is important. It's also cheaper for us to refine our own oil than to have it shipped in. This should help lower prices at the pump, however Gov. Brown will probably take that anyway.
3575 2018-01-04 19:22:15 Everyone panic! Moron Hitler is going to open coastal waters to drilling*!

(Except it's not the gov't drilling, it would be private companies, and oil prices aren't high enough to justify building expensive rigs due to shale oil.)
3576 2018-01-04 19:22:01 What a time for my boiler to stop...I have oil, but it needs maintenance. My friend who works on boilers came over & is working on it. We have whiteout snowstorm conditions here & will go into the single digits tonight. I've got to get my heat going or pipes will freeze.
3577 2018-01-04 19:21:53 Because petrocurrency is their currency, not gold. All of this BS in the world is due to OIL. He is a greedy fool that will kill us all.

3579 2018-01-04 19:21:48 I am SO excited for the next massive #oilspill! Trump has the MASSIVE-EST oil spills. No one does better.
3580 2018-01-04 19:21:43 Big oil proposed it. Then made campaign contributions to republicans. So now you’re going to do it because the @GOP has been bought.
3581 2018-01-04 19:21:41 the price of crude oil is hitting $68 a barrel, a 3 year high since 2015. The protests in Iran should be watched with a keen eye as any government upheaval could have an impact on the supply and price of oil.
3582 2018-01-04 19:21:38 Remember, oil is a commodity and in an open and free market, saudis can continue to undercut prices and push oil into the US. Best path forward is renewables.
3583 2018-01-04 19:21:37 Just did hot oil treatment and my hair feels amaze
3584 2018-01-04 19:21:36 Just stop yalls lies, don't you think we had enough of war? $ for $ what does that even mean? What about the thousand of men and women who have died? To fight the governments war? Americans are tired of sending our beautiful children to f die for yalls oil! We have been misguide
3585 2018-01-04 19:21:34 Why, oh WHY did anyone ever think #LittleMarco was ever president material? 
3586 2018-01-04 19:21:32 Until we have a better way to power our lives, oil is what we use. That's a good idea.
3587 2018-01-04 19:21:31 so all those yrs in usa was aware of #utah sen #hatch in news at times now why he retire under uhh pressure as you so well put it? am following just #trump antics, #oil #LNG &other #energy, #fed etc usual krap but not in detail

3590 2018-01-04 19:21:25 I don't know. Most likely haven't done a lot of analysis of unknown circuits where they could verify their answers. But I don't know. I do think there are a lot of ppl who hate the use of oil, and they'd support it whether it was true or not.
3591 2018-01-04 19:21:22 I say leave the drilling to the oil companies, just hand out the permits and let them go to work.
3592 2018-01-04 19:21:20 Their  failure to contribute a dime  towards the project says otherwise
It was an 80/20  joint venture with china

3595 2018-01-04 19:21:04 I mean, it will though. my brother is in the oil drilling business. Guys like him will need to build/man/operate the rigs.
3596 2018-01-04 19:20:57 If jubilee was full of guys with non plastic brains then they would have used 100B to upgrade the old railway to SGR standard and extended it to oil fields then purchase four ships with oil tankers at a cost of 90B.This will help ease cost of doing business
3597 2018-01-04 19:20:56 Cool cool so looks like all the soldiers that got killed stealing other countries oil has been totally worth it 
3598 2018-01-04 19:20:54 Shorting oil and gold I’m assuming.
3599 2018-01-04 19:20:44 yea i’ve been using that and doo gro oil but i want my hair to grow faster
3600 2018-01-04 19:20:44 Regulate them to minimize the damage. Last time I had a Percocet rx filled it was under $7.00, my insulin costs over $300. There is a need for pain meds, marijuana or CBD oil, could be better choice for pain control.
3601 2018-01-04 19:20:44 Can we sue his administration if there’s oil leaks?? Just curious.
3602 2018-01-04 19:20:43 Reminder. US consumes 20 mil barr oil/day and 28 tril cub ft gas/yr. 
(3 bil barr oil)/(20 mil barr oil/day) = 150 days.
(30 tril cub ft gas)/(28 tril cu ft/yr) = 1.1 yrs. 
Is it worth the risk to the country?

3607 2018-01-04 19:20:14 When, not if, the first oil spill happens, will you and your family personally go and try to clean up the spill?
3608 2018-01-04 19:20:12 I agree, I use CBD oil for my own seizure disorder and as a biochemist, I am working on mapping the receptors involved.  As to the AG, I don't think he wants to fill prisons, I think this is a leverage action against sanctuary states.
3609 2018-01-04 19:20:06 So what oil/gas drilling company should I invest in today? President Trump(@POTUS) is going to make me a rich man, hopefully. $PGH $EGY $ENRJ $SDR $SDT

We can never drill our way out of a 19-million-barrels-of-oil-per-day dependence. The only solution is augmenting oil with alternatives.
3645 2018-01-04 19:16:55 You have to be an Artist?!
...Watercolor or Oil!?
3646 2018-01-04 19:16:45 really all I want for my birthday is those oil blotting wipes bc I used one at my best friends ( @rachelLShoemake ) house and it was awesome and also i want @PizzaHut
3647 2018-01-04 19:16:43 No confirmation on possible crash I we can speculate till the cows come home I could say parachute evacuation near an un maned oil and gas platform waited for a boat and fled but let’s not get to 007 just yet lol
3648 2018-01-04 19:16:40 In a country where women from affluent families are getting at each other's throat for free dresses, how can you set down oil tanker tragedy to economic poverty alone? There is more to poverty than hunger and homelessness. Poverty is a mindset.
3649 2018-01-04 19:16:40 Thanks for sharing, we aren't relying at all on fluctuating Gas&Oil, in fact The @scotgov has pledged to phase out new petrol & diesel cars/vans across Scotland by 2032, earlier than the UK.  The Herald is a bad example to use like the BBC anti Scotland.
3650 2018-01-04 19:16:39 my skin has not one blemish I don’t use any products that aren’t 100% natural and essential oils are my friend theres a essential oil for literally everything
3651 2018-01-04 19:16:34 Exactly. It's like all those parents being FORCED to go to other States to get M. Oil to stop their children's seizures, etc!! Of course the rest didn't care...they were too busy lining their and their friends' pockets!!!
3652 2018-01-04 19:16:27 Have you had trouble getting a refill of heating gas or oil? We'd like to know about it. Reach out to reporter @GlobeKConti at katheleen.conti@globe.com.
3653 2018-01-04 19:16:22 yeah, but that doesn't work for freshly-minted gior who think vegetable oil is a holy emulsifier.
3654 2018-01-04 19:16:21 I can’t, my car requires a certain type of oil that’s expensive as hell and my car takes a extra quart of oil  I tried. Lol
3655 2018-01-04 19:16:18 All those Faux News women look the same. And they oil up their legs and cross them as they blather nonsense and fabrication with the good old boys who have zero respect for them, just like their god, @realDonaldTrump. Pathetic.
3656 2018-01-04 19:16:14 Aren't we up to 16 regulations repealed for every new one enacted? Major tax reform bill just passed and eliminates the individual mandate.  Foreign policy; neocon got the boot and no longer have much of a say.  My work is linked to TX oil/gas and that has picked up big time.

3660 2018-01-04 19:15:58 Given firm crude oil and rangebound of PTA futures, PFY prices in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have increased by 50-150 yuan/ton. 
On the other hand, downstream mills have held wait-and-see stance.
3661 2018-01-04 19:15:57 @realDonaldTrump I do not want oil rigs on my coast line. Our beaches and views are beautiful and this will ruin the vacation industry. Not to mention they are not safe and polute the ocean your a disgusting human being for ruining our country with greed and pollution
3662 2018-01-04 19:15:56 they ar oil
3663 2018-01-04 19:15:55 In need of an oil change 
3664 2018-01-04 19:15:51 You boob! "Unnecessary regulations" include those that protect our environment. You opened oil drilling in the Arctic and in the Atlantic where we have had disastrous spills costing billions. Who wins? Chevron, Exxon, BP and you with your large investments in oil. #criminal
3665 2018-01-04 19:15:49 Alright, more oil spills...and guess what? We have less ability to sue corporations if they do something bad! I wonder if this was part of Trump's plan all along?
3666 2018-01-04 19:15:45 I started with oil being critical from fiscal perspective. Not just because of fuel, but bcoz of the fact that we as a nation imported about USD 70 bn of oil last year when Brent averaged lesser than 50$/barrel. With it averaging 60-65$ this fiscal, impact won't be insignificant!
3667 2018-01-04 19:15:40 @JerryBrownGov  Please fight Federal's wanting to resind the legal pot smoking in California. Also fight Trump wanting to open our oceans to oil drilling and endangering our wildlife along our oceans. Thank you Governor Brown
3668 2018-01-04 19:15:37 Just high cbd oil helped my lyme disease.  I hope MO passes mm soon.
3669 2018-01-04 19:15:24 And the right time is when u take the oil fields from gvt and give us cheap oil like terrorists in syria and take guns in exchange 
Iran is not syria.

3670 2018-01-04 19:15:23 Crude oil futures have traded higher by 0.76% at INR 3,858 per barrel on Tuesday at the futures trade as speculators have widened their positions on the back of a firm trend overseas.
3671 2018-01-04 19:15:15 Trump is nothing more than a snake oil salesmen, he sold them a bill of good and they believed him. Impeach him now!
3672 2018-01-04 19:15:11 i need friends lol. i’m literally about to get my oil changed & go right back to the house where i’ve been all day.
3673 2018-01-04 19:15:10 Any other commodity producer that can push prices higher by cutting production or exports would be called a swing producer if not an effective cartel, with Saudis and OPEC it's semantics of the word "planned" ! Sorry oil bears but oil's cyclicality will allow bulls victories too.
3674 2018-01-04 19:15:00 It's all about the oil.
3675 2018-01-04 19:14:47 can we just talk about how expensive olive oil is
3676 2018-01-04 19:14:46 Same!!!! I wake up every day covered in oil and when I wear no makeup all day it keeps getting oily!! But this stuff changed my life it’s amazing
3677 2018-01-04 19:14:45 Don't want the beautiful Pacific coast turned into a deep water horizon event. We MUST protect the ecosystem & sealife that call this area home. Don't let big oil's greed jeopardize kelp beds, abalone, sea lion & seal breeding & pupping areas! Big oil cannot prevent or stop leaks
3678 2018-01-04 19:14:44 Drill baby drill! I wish people could see the dead zone off Louisiana, and we are just understanding the damage from Deepwater Hroizon.  Let’s crank down on voter’s rights and deregulate oil and gas drilling. #crazytimes
3679 2018-01-04 19:14:27 this sucks... I don't know the details of what treatments the doctors gave him, but I'm gonna go out on a limb and say they didn't try full extract cannabis oil. Could have made all the difference in his condition. But doctors don't make as much money with this treatment.
3680 2018-01-04 19:14:25 don’t feel like going to get this oil change 
3681 2018-01-04 19:14:22 You can't say nothin' slick to a can of oil.

3687 2018-01-04 19:13:49 I think your dosages may have an unintended extra kick to them. 130g of 10% flower is 13000mg or 13mg/ml at 100% efficiency. At 15% THC that's 19.5mg/ml. How are you dosing the cookies with the oil and what is the input material and %?

3690 2018-01-04 19:13:33 The problem with skewed data is they want you to believe we caused it. 
Forget the 400+ Nukes detonated.  Volcanoes that spew out TRILLIONS of tons of gasses. Forget wars, blowing up millions of barrels of oil. You caused it. I drive 300 miles a month. Politicians fly 10000000's
3691 2018-01-04 19:13:26 I abhor this man so much for what he is allowing to be done to the earth and our country! Apparently anything that results in more money for him and his cronies can be made to happen. What's a few more oil spills? He's a total MORON!

3697 2018-01-04 19:13:03 I’ve sniffed that much Olbas oil I think I’ve disintegrated my nose. 
3698 2018-01-04 19:13:03 Building an oil rig in earth quake zone.....smart.
3699 2018-01-04 19:13:00 You are going to allow drilling off of every coast in the US. NICE!  Nothing is better than laying on oil soaked sand when you go to the beach. After the disastrous BP OIL SPILL in 2010, we learned how oil companies had no idea how to prevent or clean up an oil spill.  #WINNING
3700 2018-01-04 19:12:50 OIL MONEY? Or maybe to them it is sand money?
3701 2018-01-04 19:12:37 So many lefties complaining about the oil drilling that Trump opened up. I love it.

3702 2018-01-04 19:12:13 Bio oil does really well with my acne scars if you want to try that! It might help sun spots but I'd recommend using serums with vitamin c and gentle exfoliations. I use the p:rem radiance peeling sleeping pack which helps with hydration & overnight gentle exfoliation!
3703 2018-01-04 19:12:11 Why is Rose essential oil so costly? It takes 3000-5000 POUNDS of rose petals to make only 1 POUND of pure Rose essential oil! #NationalTriviaDay
3704 2018-01-04 19:12:06 We have enough domestic production to sustain ourselves, this would likely be for export. And Saudis can produce oil much cheaper than US, ocean drilling is dangerous and expensive. Smarter move is to invest in renewables.
3705 2018-01-04 19:12:06 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
3706 2018-01-04 19:11:58 Yeah! Maybe we should start hunting whales again to use their oil and blubber, because JOBS is all that matters, right? Screw long-term sustainability. JOBS NOW, EARTH LATER, wooooooo
3707 2018-01-04 19:11:45 Please do what you can to prevent offshore oil drilling. @SenKamalaHarris
3708 2018-01-04 19:11:45 Glad to say my discipleship has paid off in filling the world with more enthusiasm for oil.
3709 2018-01-04 19:11:40 Crude oil it is :)
3710 2018-01-04 19:11:28 They think some oil and a brush gonna make it shine like nooo booo
3711 2018-01-04 19:11:24 I guess they are finally taking Trump seriously. Good! Those oil tankers are still sitting in the waters in South Korea.
3712 2018-01-04 19:11:21 Its the game plan my dear brother.. During the campaign the remaining Chibok girls+UniMaid lecturers+Oil workers will be released.Propaganda

3715 2018-01-04 19:11:17 The Trump administration announced Thursday it is planning to dramatically expand offshore drilling, opening almost all U.S. coastal waters to potential oil and gas exploration and development.
3716 2018-01-04 19:11:16 @jockowillink hey brother. Going through THE Field Manual... IF/when you decide to eat the 80% chocolate with the coconut oil....what type/brand do you eat?

3719 2018-01-04 19:11:01 Not sure which is worse: Pepper oil in your eye or pepper oil in your nose. Both are rather unpleasant.

3721 2018-01-04 19:10:51 You can't say that without doing now research.   The oil that is being produced and marijuana hybrids are much different that regular old pot.   Ive seen first hand healthy people smoke enough of this to lose consciousness,  and I've personally seen two seemingly healthy people

3731 2018-01-04 19:10:18 Correct, Iran was granting oil concessions to the UK and US. I'm not disputing the corrupt nature of both UK and US governments, having their hands in Iran. I was merely correcting you on a key fact that Mossadegh was not elected 'democratically', he was appointed.
3732 2018-01-04 19:10:12 artic oil on its way, damn the environment full speed ahead !!
3733 2018-01-04 19:10:12 It gets worse: I hear the oil they drill in these waters will only be sold to owners of premium luxury cars and yachts.
3734 2018-01-04 19:09:57 And evening primrose oil!  works wonders for me x
3735 2018-01-04 19:09:56 Palm oil business... Locate the state where they sell it cheap buy for a Start 25 liters and resale... Do your Survey first before you start... Try akwaibom.
3736 2018-01-04 19:09:48 @HurdOnTheHill Yeah right! Things are going great with NK. Xi, now the architect of trade in the Pac Rim, punked DT. See the pics of Chinese oil being loaded onto NK ships. Keep following DT. So corrupt and inept that even Wells F won't lend him money. Fool!
3737 2018-01-04 19:09:43 How does Pence think the oil got there. Did “God” put it there? You know the earth is only 6000 years old.
3738 2018-01-04 19:09:42 @SecretaryZinke No amount of oil is going to make us an "energy superpower". The future is not in the past. The next energy superpower will be a leader in renewables - - a category Trump administration policies are rapidly ceding to China.
3739 2018-01-04 19:09:31 1. CNN recently reported that the US is will be "Oil King" in 2018 due to all the shale and other oil production already existing.
2. The lobbyists that brokered this deal with the Trump administration,  returns the favor by garnering support from MoC on a sinking presidency.
3740 2018-01-04 19:09:21 I missed the smell of my tea tree oil
3741 2018-01-04 19:09:07 You've won me over for this oil debate
3742 2018-01-04 19:09:01 Enough. This has to stop. The oceans belong to earth - not Trump, not the USA and certainly not the greedy oil and gas companies who support him.
3743 2018-01-04 19:08:52 But this is exactly why it will remain illegal, because the prison machine needs blood for its oil. It needs to create a false enemy that it can control. You can't make anxiety meds in your backyard garden... or maybe you can
3744 2018-01-04 19:08:51 There needs to be legislation to address the need for legal medicinal use including the CBD oil which does not create a high and to decide on recreational use for commerce.  What is your bill Kamala? Initiative or rhetoric?
3745 2018-01-04 19:08:48 the one time I actually go to get my oil changed like a decent person they are closed !!! HA so sad
3746 2018-01-04 19:08:47 Happy #NationalTriviaDay! Which notorious gangster was captured by the #FBI after kidnapping Oklahoma oil tycoon, Charles F. Urschel, in 1933?
3747 2018-01-04 19:08:45 The Federal Government has agreed to grant oil marketers further concession to access Foreign Exchange (FOREX) at a rate below the official N305 per dollar to enable them resume importation of petrol.
3748 2018-01-04 19:08:41 An the oil companies will sell the majority to other countries leaving US to still buy foreign oil.
3749 2018-01-04 19:08:36 Is he taking literal bribes or is he just sick? Trump unveiled a plan Thursday to  permit drilling in most U.S. continental shelf waters, including  protected areas of the Arctic and the Atlantic, where oil and gas  exploration is opposed by governors from New Jersey to Florida.
3750 2018-01-04 19:08:35 Add a vitamin c oil and sunscreen and you’re good!
3751 2018-01-04 19:08:34 Don't forget he's going to authorize off shore oil drilling. Forget about pristine beaches.
3752 2018-01-04 19:08:09 Sitting here for 1/2 hr waiting for an oil change, called up to pay & he says $7  thought I was getting a discount until he says we’re printing your inspection 
3753 2018-01-04 19:08:08 BTW who will be disciplined for the containment and arrest of protesters on inauguration day? Let's focus on making this country better not stuffing the pockets of oil barrens and weapons manufacturers.
3754 2018-01-04 19:07:50 What’s the calculations for CO2 emissions release from a Transatlantic oil tanker moving oil from Middle East to Texas verse emissions for Drilling offshore California to California refinery? Est (CIA) 4295 oil tankers of 1,000 tons dead weight or greater in the world.
3755 2018-01-04 19:07:50 Then again, without INNOVATION, econ. growth can only go so far. Oil exploration of not innovation.
3756 2018-01-04 19:07:49 Thanks Andy :D I know some vegans won’t eat chips from fried chicken shops because they worry they’ve been fried in the same oil. Do you go to chips shops? (Genuine q)

I don't regret it though.  
Burnt a finger. It was worth it.
3769 2018-01-04 19:06:58 Are you crazy? You are a monster, destroying our environment. I used to walk on the beach in Santa Barbara and come home with a sole of tar on my feet from the oil spills off the coast. You are SO out of touch. RESIGN. EVEN BANNON IS LAUGHING AT YOU!! #ImpeachTrump
3770 2018-01-04 19:06:55 Usually cooked in lard oil too
3771 2018-01-04 19:06:28 This is a shame. We have enough problems with deregulation, thanks to Trumpistan, and, at minimum, this will endanger marine life from oil spills that are bound to happen.
3772 2018-01-04 19:06:27 Looks like a version of mad maxx
3773 2018-01-04 19:06:25 Sounds like a lot to ask.

3776 2018-01-04 19:06:05 Technology and market forces should make oil and gas exploitation in offshore waters a poor option, but biodiversity exploration wise
3777 2018-01-04 19:06:02 NO OIL IN SIGHT!!!!! I’ve tried every drug store and high end brand and NOTHING beats it. Nadaaaaa
3778 2018-01-04 19:05:58 We can NEVER drill our way out from foreign dependency. We simply do not have large CHEAP TO DRILL reserves of oil. They do.

If you want to reduce foreign dependency, then MOVE AWAY FROM OIL. We have plenty of sun, uranium, onshore wind, geothermal, offshore wind, hydro for EVs.
3779 2018-01-04 19:05:53 No, just a broken promise to a longstanding customer that wasted $150. No need to sand except for promised oil delivery.
3780 2018-01-04 19:05:52 Watching rigs go up around the pristine Channel Islands was a travesty - dealing with spills and globs of oil on the beaches, an insult to the planet. This is an atrocity.
3781 2018-01-04 19:05:48 Drill baby drill! We have to discontinue depending upon foreign oil.
3782 2018-01-04 19:05:46 2) Both Exxon and the Koch’s are known for their heavy financial support to organizations that promote doubt over climate science, peddle fossil fuel use and attack clean energy on precedent. The Heritage Foundation has played a consistent role in promoting the oil ideology.
3783 2018-01-04 19:05:45 Let's hope that we finally have an end to the phony pot "pharmacies!"  Public health policies need to be based on scientific evidence NOT snake oil sales pitches!
3784 2018-01-04 19:05:37 @thechew help your 2018 goal by trying a Lemon Liver Flush! 1 lemon, 4c water, 2T olive oil, blend, strain, drink!
3785 2018-01-04 19:05:34 he also trying to lift safety regulations that save lives. The drilling plan comes on the heels of a separate proposal to repeal offshore drilling safety regulations that were put in place after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster

3787 2018-01-04 19:05:27 My AAC M4 is slightly more effective than a Purolator oil filter.

Allegedly. 
I live in Los Angeles County so I wouldn't know about such thingys.
3788 2018-01-04 19:05:21 He can expand all he wants, unles oil hits 70, and stays, they won’t be drilling.
3789 2018-01-04 19:05:12 I use medical marijuana and CBD oil to treat pain and muscle spasms due to Transverse Myelitis. My quality of life would be next to nothing without both.  Sessions is a bastard. Period.
3790 2018-01-04 19:05:10 Mr. President, you need to look into the price of oil.  At three year high.  This will suck the tax break money away from the middle class and poor.  Please help.
3791 2018-01-04 19:05:08 For goodness sake.... can we just admit this administration is in the pocket of the oil and gas industry. This is just ridiculous it's like they want to take us back to the dark age.

3793 2018-01-04 19:05:00 my skincare routine is:
1. any random ass face wash
2. witch hazel as toner
3. rose oil to moisturize
4. use an exfoliating scrub when i remember
ok... ...drag me girls...
3794 2018-01-04 19:04:59 The elites know we’re running on fumes and they destroy the rest of nature to supply their demand for oil 
3795 2018-01-04 19:04:54 And no regulations? Oil spills galore. 
3796 2018-01-04 19:04:50 Coconut oil is comedogenic. I don’t use it on my face at all anymore. Especially not to clean off makeup. I prefer jojoba since it more closesly matches the skin’s natural oil
3797 2018-01-04 19:04:47 If we have our own oil expanse, we get to closer it’s feed while having it cheaper for greater renewal energy sources. Resulting in less use, in time, less fumes, better environment.
3798 2018-01-04 19:04:45 Have they forgotten the BP Oil Spill issue? Or more likely, ignored it in the first place....
3799 2018-01-04 19:04:44 Could Republicans be Republicans without the backing of big oil and gas? (This goes for all politicians who take $$ from the industry, but primarily the GOP). Seems like it's behind much of their agenda.
3800 2018-01-04 19:04:44 .@GovInslee also criticizing @POTUS administration decision to open up gas and oil drilling off U.S. coast. #waleg
3801 2018-01-04 19:04:39 5-10 drops of eucalyptus or peppermint oil.
3802 2018-01-04 19:04:39 Amount of bribe?  How will the money be laundered?  Trump oil.
3803 2018-01-04 19:04:36 People dont realize how expensive it is to set up rigs out past 3 miles of sea water and then bring that oil back to land...the juice aint worth the squeeze...oil is $60 a barrel right now...but then again it hasnt stopped trump from being an idiot
3804 2018-01-04 19:04:33 Plastic in the sea is a huge danger to the animals (and the humans who eat them). So is oil and chemical pollution. These are things we *can* change.
3805 2018-01-04 19:04:31 If Agric sector can't be attributed to him,then who?When last did you see  production of local rice before emergence of PMB on the scene? What of the oil palm sector of agric when he banned import of palm oil? Oh you didn't we were importing it? Is it toothpick? Or cassava flour?
3806 2018-01-04 19:04:27 Your right maybe they will find more oil?? Or find the mermaids..
3807 2018-01-04 19:04:25 More oil drilling in fragile ecosystems, less weed! America is back baby
3808 2018-01-04 19:04:20 Hey, it's not like his Keystone decision was wrong and within the first year there was an oil spill of several hundred thousand gallons! Oh wait, that's exactly what happened.
3809 2018-01-04 19:04:16 I had an appointment to get my oil changed at 10:30...I’m still sitting in this place waiting  With no food...I’m about to punch someone..
3810 2018-01-04 19:04:16 His oil friends have to pay their bills!
3811 2018-01-04 19:04:13 White House: We gotta have more oil spills.
3812 2018-01-04 19:04:04 she oil-uh-ly  LOL
3813 2018-01-04 19:04:02 Communist? I beg to differ. Progressive. I believe in hard work and earning a living. If only trickle down economics actually worked. More jobs ALWAYS sounds like a good argument. I'm SURE other alternatives exist than more oil exploration to grow the economy, jobs etc.
3814 2018-01-04 19:03:48 If they have leased signed asap a future administration won't be able to undo the policy with respect to existing leases without paying a lot of money to the oil companies - the lease can last for decades
3815 2018-01-04 19:03:47 Will oil take out its 2015 high by the close? 30m to go. #6258
3816 2018-01-04 19:03:45 That’s a good point, when I was a kid my dad took us to the games at the Gardens and also at JP arena. I couldn’t even tell you who the coach is now. Oiler fans should get some awareness of the Oil Kings.
3817 2018-01-04 19:03:42 Get clarins detox oil it stops everything 
3818 2018-01-04 19:03:39 Thanks for that important addendum. I'll also add: environmental regulations. Now he wants to override California's offshore oil drilling? Over my dead Surfrider body...
3819 2018-01-04 19:03:34 Those 3 FA cups will soon look like the good oil’ days. SMH
3820 2018-01-04 19:03:31 Oil rigs & spills are a go. But windmills are out of the question
3821 2018-01-04 19:03:26 And regulations have been rolled back so, the oil will be spilling everywhere with no legal repercussions. They won't be careful
3822 2018-01-04 19:03:17 Will someone go sit in my car at Valvoline this afternoon to get my oil changed? (I am way overdue for it.) It's too cold and I don't want to do it. I'll give you my debit card to pay for it.
3823 2018-01-04 19:03:09 Fry him in hot oil. He'll die.
3824 2018-01-04 19:02:54 Drove by our beautiful Refugio Beach a couple of years ago after an oil spill. It was awful to see and smell. So sad...
3825 2018-01-04 19:02:53 @RyanZinke anything for a buck, right Ryan? You're a disgrace. My new year's wish for you is that you drown in a pool of oil.
3826 2018-01-04 19:02:47 Someone should tell Trump that oil floats on water. Drill holes in the oceans floor, let oil seep to the surface, have guys in rowboats use brooms to sweep it to shore, pick it up and make gas and stuff. He'll understand.
3827 2018-01-04 19:02:39 There you go TRUMPSTERS! Ur president now wants to OPEN UP OFF SHORE DRILLING, even though it will KILL TOURISM IN ALL THE STATES FROM NEW JERSEY TO THE SOUTHERN STATES AND BEYOND! DIDNT WE LEARN FROM THE LAST OIL SPILL! That hurt tourism, fisheries, and ALL LIFE IN THE OCEAN!!
3828 2018-01-04 19:02:32 A single drop of peppermint essential oil is equivalent to 28 cups of peppermint tea #NationalTriviaDay
3829 2018-01-04 19:02:29 Very thankful for good genes and vitamin e oil.
3830 2018-01-04 19:02:29 See where the Department of the Interior Secretary is continuing with his going out of business sale.  First, give away national parks. Second, give away oil drilling rights along East/West coast.  And who said the GOP couldn't physically destroy the US?
3831 2018-01-04 19:02:27 Renewable sustainable energy exists (Solar  Wind Geothermal ). It’s more affordable long term too. When will corporations stop environmental malfeasance? Water in Houston & Galveston’s Gulf of Mexico still dirty from BP’s oil spill & chemical spills in hurricane Harvey!
3832 2018-01-04 19:02:25 Chip, DACA, expansion of Medicaid, a just taxation system, medical expenses, oil pipelines running through our state.
3833 2018-01-04 19:02:21 you dont even know the 33 billions are for there natto troops for milletry weapons and oil.our gdp is strong enough to survive. we dont need someone,s aid.we have all the records.
3834 2018-01-04 19:02:15 Sounds so good of the CIA and MI6 to do that for the shah! So friendly in providing that service.......! Iran does have oil? And someone to do a favor for a favor? Sounds about right
3835 2018-01-04 19:02:14 That is the shiny thing to distract - don’t let them drill for oil off our coasts!!  
3836 2018-01-04 19:02:14 We can’t have Wind mills but oil rigs are picturesque
3837 2018-01-04 19:02:09 Is there lots of demand at the moment for new drilling? It had really slowed down when price was low. Guess next step is to start a war and really boost oil prices. Ug!!!
3838 2018-01-04 19:01:58 Avila Beach, a small oceanside community about 100 miles north of Santa Barbara also had a serious oil problem with Unocal in 1989, where a huge toxic lake of crude had formed from leaks in the pipes, saturating the earth underneath. Avila Beach was declared a Superfund site.
3839 2018-01-04 19:01:57 Maybe somebody should do Jeff Sessions a favor and slip some THC oil in his Mint Julip!
3840 2018-01-04 19:01:56 @realDonaldTrump — Open those coastal waters and drill that oil.  We support you to “Make America Great again.” Good job Mr.President!!!
3841 2018-01-04 19:01:53 I have a similar anti-cold regimen, but I alternated between drops of peppermint oil in hot water and a warm salt gargle. Add winter oranges, cinnamon tea, sriracha-covered stir fry and miso soup every hour.
3842 2018-01-04 19:01:49 Trump: more offshore drilling. 

Okay! Im happy so long as there is no oil spills
3843 2018-01-04 19:01:49 Oil surges 2 a 3 yr high. Oh the cartels will b happy. Esp in Russia they can make some profit at last. It's $70 p/barrel 4 Tapis crude now.
3844 2018-01-04 19:01:44 All other countries r drilling for oil n gas everywhere n getting wealthy for it.Russia for instance would be in complete poverty w/o oil exports. Yet we were limiting ourselves fr drilling in d pretext of global warming,which is now clearly a myth w freezing temp all ovr d world

3850 2018-01-04 19:01:13 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds celery.

3853 2018-01-04 19:01:02 Sadly so very true. 
3854 2018-01-04 19:00:47 Even if @realDonaldTrump doesn't think CO2 is warming the atmosphere (basic physics) & doesn't think CO2 is acidifying our oceans (basic chemistry)-at least he should know that coal, oil & natural gas are NON RENEWABLE.
3855 2018-01-04 19:00:44 There was no oil spill in the gulf. It was fake news.
3856 2018-01-04 19:00:39 Don’t think we get organix in the UK. going to go back to separate herbal essence argan oil after this 2in1 is finished.
3857 2018-01-04 19:00:38 Sad truth: If a person's only concern was oil and natural gas prices, drill-baby-drill worked. Proponents now have that example to prop up their argument.

The weird thing is that prices aren't a problem now. More drilling doesn't solve anything, even by their way of thinking.
3858 2018-01-04 19:00:36 Expanding offshore drilling the same week I invest in 3 oil/gas stocks is a big win.

3860 2018-01-04 19:00:33 OIL DIFF: 6.28 -> 6.33
3861 2018-01-04 19:00:27 Directed crackdown on legal cannibus, offshore oil drilling ban recinded, SALT deductions eliminated. It's pretty clear the Trump administration is at war with the people of the Pacific States.

3863 2018-01-04 19:00:20 This is bad news for CA Republicans like Issa, Nunes, and Walters. 

We don't need the oil. We have an oil glut. 

Wells in the US are temporarily capped until the prices go up. Jared & EXXON are trying to get OPEC to continue to reduce output so that the price goes up.
3864 2018-01-04 19:00:18 Thanks for voting for Obamacare and hurting the middle class. And thanks for voting against jobs and the middle class tax cuts. And the middle class will be even more thankful with your expensive oil, which hurts them and the poor most of all.

3874 2018-01-04 18:59:35 Before you panic..
1) Drilling in arctic is too expensive & thus not profitable at current oil prices.
2) There's not much oil known to be off the East Coast so that will be exploration at most initially. 
3) There is a lot of known oil off California but CA will NOT allow it.
3875 2018-01-04 18:59:26 That’s an entirely different point to : “use of oil money”

3878 2018-01-04 18:59:21 After today's federal decisions on weed and offshore oil drilling, can we PLEASE put to rest the idea that Republicans give even the smallest shit about states rights?
3879 2018-01-04 18:59:09 ok no I'm not in the mood to listen to your shitty audio blasting when I'm in the seat next to you waiting for my oil change to be done
3880 2018-01-04 18:58:57 My beef with Chia is not getting a offensive Dman in the off season, and forcing the Oil to play and rely on Auvitu and Grybs far to much. Who would have thought Hendy and Pou had that much impact on PK, I didn't!
3881 2018-01-04 18:58:56 Opens fridge: looks like I'm having eggs and rice for breakfast heck yeah. 
We have no kind of oil at all: oh okay hard boiled eggs fuck yeah
The eggs have expired. Rice it is then. 
We need to buy groceries
3882 2018-01-04 18:58:56 O. M. G. There went lunch!
3883 2018-01-04 18:58:44 Not Cool -at all. One of the nasty beaches of California is Santa Barbara beach and this was like 30 plus yrs ago, those oil rigs right off the coast line and the smell -dirty ocean water, it was terrible.
3884 2018-01-04 18:58:36 And abolishes safety regulations for the oil rigs. Dear god get this MFer out of office.
3885 2018-01-04 18:58:35 Having experience with home made explosives and incendiary mixes...   The main ingredients are sugar and oil.  IF you can get that to burn, its gonna burn fast.  Period.  (Look up rocket candy.  Love that stuff)
3886 2018-01-04 18:58:17 I fail to see how there's anything positive about lost oil production.....

Trump moves to expand oil and gas drilling off coast of California, other U.S. waters
THURSDAY, JANUARY 4, 2018, 10:46 AM PT
@gregory_clay
3891 2018-01-04 18:57:54 Please be mindful of who Donny answers too with every rage tweet. Oil has quietly increased to $61 a barrel. Without this revenue, Russia really has very little to increase its GDP. The increases also line Putin’s pockets. Donny’s doing a great job for his boss.
3892 2018-01-04 18:57:48 With a rebel yell, she cried more more more
3893 2018-01-04 18:57:46 Sauté with onions/ celery/carrots and spices in oil or fat, cover and let steam for a bit, serve as you would rice ( soy sauce is good)
3894 2018-01-04 18:57:34 Oh HELL NO. We already had enough of that shit on the Gulf Coast with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.
3895 2018-01-04 18:57:32 Is it not remarkable? Simple oil of cloves, and how amazing the results
3896 2018-01-04 18:57:19 It’s as if every still shot in p&p is an oil painting. The lighting director is genius!
3897 2018-01-04 18:57:17 The only thing to be done is to accelerate our development of alternative energy to the point where oil no longer makes sense. Thank you  @elonmusk
3898 2018-01-04 18:57:16 Cook with oconut oil/MCT oil, real butter, cheese in moderation
3899 2018-01-04 18:57:05 But it smells good and leaves hair conditioned. OR get Organix (OGX) the Argan oil shampoo and conditioner
3900 2018-01-04 18:57:05 My mums ill so i made her an extra hot bubbly bath with olbus oil, candles, relaxing optical lights, and a cup of tea.. plus put her pjs and blanket on the radiator so its warm when she gets out.. soz but someone wife me up
3901 2018-01-04 18:57:03 Yes but not completely . There's other factors like oil , drugs , immigration and medicine. But on the whole the world would be a better place without religion.
3902 2018-01-04 18:57:02 Well they do have all the money they need with endowed oil wells and the like. I could see them screwing us just cause they can. I like that attitude in sports and in life.
3903 2018-01-04 18:57:00 India imports $10 billion in oil from Nigeria. Spain Brasil Netherlands and south Africa  are also main trading partners. 
It is possible to have a safe (CC aside) and fair oil sector in a country but only Norway had done it.  Everyone else has failed at it.
3904 2018-01-04 18:56:56 you know it’s cold when you’re breaking your fingers tryna get the coconut oil out the container
3905 2018-01-04 18:56:55 You wanted him so now you get oil rigs off your coast
3906 2018-01-04 18:56:43 fucken bacon oil popped on my fucken nipple
3907 2018-01-04 18:56:37 Well you have to but actual peppermint oil. I use it for multiple purposes including keeping field mice out of the house. You can but it at most grocery stores.
3908 2018-01-04 18:56:26 I just want to rub oil all over dat sexy body!  #SoSexy
3909 2018-01-04 18:56:14 Lol yeah if you eating spiced cabbage we say u have money this time of the year. Some of us eat it without cooking oil nd spice. Just salt only
3910 2018-01-04 18:56:11 Get a bowl of water, add groundnut oil in it then drop The fone in it for 15mins. The oil will make d hanging twitter slippery n it will work effectively. 

No need to thank me, what are friends for?
3911 2018-01-04 18:56:02 The Trump administration is starting 2018 off with a bang for the oil and gas industry. They have proposed to open up 90% of US offshore reserves to oil and gas drilling with 47 lease sales scheduled from 2019 to 2024 #oilandgas #offshore #drilling #proposal #newyear #lease #ENN
3912 2018-01-04 18:56:01 I'd love to know what my R Congressman @Scotttaylorva intends to do about this. How about it Scott? Got a response to your constituents? I know. You'll say we need the oil. Right?
3913 2018-01-04 18:56:00 More oil spills 2018
3914 2018-01-04 18:55:55 ** wants a G-Wagon, whines about the $140 I spent at the dealership on an oil/filter change **
3915 2018-01-04 18:55:53 I have 2 very inflamed small pimples under my eye,like I can see these shits out the corner of my eye,that's how close to my eyes they are...pure tea tree oil is needed to fix this crisis
3916 2018-01-04 18:55:49 Rose soap and aloe vera gel from the plant. Like a mask almost with 100% vitamin e oil. Since sunday I’ve been doing the routine day and night..
3917 2018-01-04 18:55:43 This man is an ignoramus. In 2014 he wrote to the papers saying Scotland would lose the “generous annual £30 billion grant from England”, completely unaware that we only get part of our taxes and none of the oil revenues back.
3918 2018-01-04 18:55:38 I think there would be a lot less oil spills if they took apart their machines and cleaned them often. #GoTrump
3919 2018-01-04 18:55:34 BREAKING: The Trump admin is massively expanding offshore drilling. Oil exploration and drilling will be green-lit in the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic, and in areas that had previously been protected, such as waters off of California.
3920 2018-01-04 18:55:32 Because the last oil spill disaster wasn't bad enough...
3921 2018-01-04 18:55:20 Looks like you had a delicious dinner 
3922 2018-01-04 18:55:19 You are absolutely correct!  Here in oil field country business is booming. We can’t find enough people to fill the job openings.
3923 2018-01-04 18:55:03 Awesome!! I’m pretty psyched for everything I just ordered — including avocado oil and coconut manna! And all the superfoods .
3924 2018-01-04 18:54:59 Democrats famously hate oil
3925 2018-01-04 18:54:57 I have a gut feeling that the GOP is scurrying to get their
agenda (ie Sessions/ Marijauna , Trump (oil drilling, tax reform etc) before Trump resigns. Everything seems accelerated this week.
3926 2018-01-04 18:54:52 Finland has dentists in hospitals,  when the doctors struck( greedy sods) he was 48 hours from flying out to get the wisdoms pulled.
He then got his invite in.
Hope you gets sorted.
Cloves oil is bloody good for dental pain .
3927 2018-01-04 18:54:49 People objected to have wind mills off shore, bec they thought it would ruin the view. Ha now they can look at oil rigs.
3928 2018-01-04 18:54:47 Oh I guess he forgot about what happened during the gulf of Mexico oil spill. I live in lower Alabama and we still have the after effects
3929 2018-01-04 18:54:42 Why would any driller put out input costs in a drilling area that requires sustained $100+ oil if they can be profitable in PA,TX, ND at $50?
3930 2018-01-04 18:54:36 Oil Can Boyd abides.
3931 2018-01-04 18:54:33 Oil is Dead .
3932 2018-01-04 18:54:31 That is, they are switching to oil for electricity generation due to shortage of #NatGas.
3933 2018-01-04 18:54:28 we need to stop this from happening, no off shore drilling anywhere!! enough already with destroying everything.  when there is a spill or leak, the oil industry, calls it an accident, no accident, man made errors.
3934 2018-01-04 18:54:27 AMERICAN OLIGARCHS ENCOURAGED BY “R-TV SPIN-OFF” @FoxNews ,HEDGE FUND MANAGERS, & BIG OIL...  DISGUSTING
3935 2018-01-04 18:54:20 efo, without oil? Would love to learn o!
3936 2018-01-04 18:54:19 If there are any pockets of oil just offshore from Mar-a-Lago that would be a truly wonderful place to start.
3937 2018-01-04 18:54:16 أنا بحب أكتب الvolatile oil في كل الاكتيف كونستيتونت اوي، بحسها هي دي درجة النجاح

3939 2018-01-04 18:54:04 Everyone is dependent on oil this will help bring prices down and more jobs. Probably will get the left all jacked up as well, unintended perk!
3940 2018-01-04 18:53:57 Next time I take my hair down I’m giving myself a hot oil treatment 
3941 2018-01-04 18:53:53 Ha ha ha
3942 2018-01-04 18:53:51 agreed. religion and oil cause too many deaths.
3943 2018-01-04 18:53:39 LOL!
3944 2018-01-04 18:53:37 If prices soar, oil companies still have to build terminals on shore and that takes years.

Economics only goes so far. You need to have high prices for years AND a clean record for oil spills to not scare off local voters.
3945 2018-01-04 18:53:33 throughout the entire year my skin has enough oil in it to fry a whole SAMOSA but all of sudden winter comes around & BOOM. it’s drier than the sahara desert. like IK DAMN WELL all that oil didn’t just magically disappear to saudi arabia
3946 2018-01-04 18:53:33 Take care of your own car ladies..these niggas will b in neighboring cities talkin bout they gettin ya oil changed..stay woke
3947 2018-01-04 18:53:20 I don’t have a book to recommend,  but I love making salads. I always add a fruit, usually apple or dried cranberries and seeds make all the difference. My favourite dressing is avocado oil with lemon and salt and pepper. Baby spinach is my favourite base.
3948 2018-01-04 18:53:12 I'm waiting for my car to get an oil change and tire rotation and I've never felt like an adult more than I do at this moment
3949 2018-01-04 18:53:10 LMAO! I need back breaks. And it’s leaking oil in the front near the right tire. But I feel like you talked to me about that before
3950 2018-01-04 18:53:08 Grapeseed oil
3951 2018-01-04 18:53:02 So much for our oceans. #drillbabydrill new anthem for @realDonaldTrump.  Why?? Why?? Oil prices low.   What is the point? 90 pct of available US waters to be opened for big oil. #shameonthem.
3952 2018-01-04 18:52:56 Ppl risking their lives for an oil change today I see
3953 2018-01-04 18:52:47 @SecretaryZinke, hopefully your grandchildren will find a way to forgive you. Oil and gas are inherently dirty sources of energy....#oilexploration #dirtyenergy #GlobalWarming #oilindustrybitch
3954 2018-01-04 18:52:44 if anyone knows the super cute guy that works at the valvoline oil change place on Southfield road please DM me. Serious inquires only
3955 2018-01-04 18:52:41 musher’s secret cream or coconut oil on his pads will help so that the salt doesn’t stick directly into the pads and you can wipe it when you get inside or booties!
3956 2018-01-04 18:52:35 I use CBD oil for pain management
3957 2018-01-04 18:52:29 We don't need further investment in oil we need more investment in the green energy technologies that will get us there though.
3958 2018-01-04 18:52:29 It takes 2 to jerk  off a dick right! It takes 2 to jerk off right now,I'm going to gab a towel & lotion or baby oil right now,and take off my boxers right now!I love when I have a hard cum!I want 2 jerk off rightnow!I'm not international own but I jerk off a cock like a micphone
3959 2018-01-04 18:52:18 Wrong-headed and a giveaway to oil industry. Remember Deepwater?
3960 2018-01-04 18:52:08 I had that with them once, only it was garlic oil, they said they’d run out, I walked round the corner and they had a shelf full of it, lazy bastard didn’t wanna walk 10ft to get another bottle 
3961 2018-01-04 18:52:00 Yes, I have excavated them with my own hands, and even wrote an article about Roman amphora stoppers. Of course the cultivation of olives predates Islam, I never said otherwise. My claim was about olive oil soap. Therefore Dr. Taleb is employing a straw man argument.
3962 2018-01-04 18:51:59 Not oil
3963 2018-01-04 18:51:58 Lol when you realize you’re about 3 months past needing a new inspection sticker and an oil change
3964 2018-01-04 18:51:56 protip to Cal Senate Dems and @reyesa: "We'll give Trump our oil when he chokes it out of our walruses and whales and seabirds." Or something like that.
3965 2018-01-04 18:51:48 Natalie is telling me chic fil a fries their chicken in pickle oil.. can anyone confirm???
3966 2018-01-04 18:51:48 No deeper than an oil slick.
3967 2018-01-04 18:51:42 The craziest thing about the "let me call a guy" Pawn Stars meme is it's not even far off from what happens. Last night they brought in a Woody Woodpecker oil painting expert. "I got a buddy..."
3968 2018-01-04 18:51:40 As Donald Trump opens up federal waters to drilling and allows oil platforms to be built in areas where they've been banned since 1969, remember that he said offshore wind was "monstrous" and "ugly."
3969 2018-01-04 18:51:40 There are many ways to reduce energy prices. Oil giants should start to invest on renewable energies instead of taking backward trend toward drilling. I do not know why this admin loves to damage our planet when there are better ways to make profit.

3971 2018-01-04 18:51:19 Trump admin will allow new offshore gas & oil drilling in most US waters, opening access to 100 million acres. - #GetReadyToFight

3973 2018-01-04 18:51:18 hey, if you're cold but not experienced w/ wind-chill cold (temperatures below -30C/-20F), non-obvious tips: you can layer pants, as long as it doesn't restrict movement; gloves are not enough, layer mittens on top; put shea butter/coconut oil/goose grease/w/e on exposed face.
3974 2018-01-04 18:51:13 they've been rising for hundreds or thousands of years.  Louisiana's specific problem is it was an active delta with mostly marsh grass and swamp.  Canals from the oil industry allow too much sea water, allow erosion that isn't replenished from the river.
3975 2018-01-04 18:51:13 Oil & gas is very much affected by the supply/demand balance. If what Trump is proposing is taken up by the industry then there's a danger of oversupply with a collapse in oil/gas prices. I think the industry will treat any new acreage on offer with caution.
3976 2018-01-04 18:51:11 My wife is currently on hold for 40 minutes and counting trying to get warranty help on a brand new washer that's leaking oil like crazy. @WhirlpoolCare you should do better!
3977 2018-01-04 18:51:11 I work on the oil patch. Working for contractor contracted to oil company. Rrsp-cut. Ten percent wage cut. Ten percent retention bonus- cut. Full time federal driver, but no minimum wage- hours dropped 60%, overtime first. Shareholders & management subsidized
3978 2018-01-04 18:51:10 Oh no. I can't really tolerate the smoke at all. But we have plenty of heating oil, propane for cooking, food for a long while. We're fine! 
3979 2018-01-04 18:51:04 Now we can place bets on which parts of federal draft plan for offshore oil and gas leasing get into next stage, the proposed plan, and then which parts make the cut for the final plan

Where is clean energy?

3985 2018-01-04 18:50:32 Interesting point but I imagine it’s because Iranian unrest occurs in an unstable region that is the world’s biggest oil production basin.

3989 2018-01-04 18:50:18 Well they had to do the oil thing because cars leaked like a sieve, or burned oil in a cloud behind the car.

3994 2018-01-04 18:50:11 Um, cause the president is vested in oil pipelines. Conflict of interest, much?
3995 2018-01-04 18:50:10 For a small beard, no more than 6 drops of oil. For a larger beard, up to 10 drops of oil is necessary. Remember, you can always add more if need be.

3997 2018-01-04 18:50:01 @RealDonad_Trump Please include offshore wind energy into your plans as well as drilling. It would be great to get all energy we can from home vs. our enemies like Iran. Those huge offshore wind projects would help just like oil and we can gain independence much faster! #thanks
3998 2018-01-04 18:50:01 Donald is so greedy he really doesn't care how much of our country he destroys. He wants to get his hands on Iran oil, remember that? The greed will bring him down, hurry Mr. Mueller!

My Eforiro is so 
4000 2018-01-04 18:49:53 Yeah. I heard Russia has two big things- Oil and Alcohol, and they want to keep alcohol for themselves 
4001 2018-01-04 18:49:45 Isn't that free, though , when your president can decide that protests in an oil rich country US is interested in are OK, yet your president demands you deny your own people freedom to protest without him making a meal of it.
4002 2018-01-04 18:49:41 Why r they doing this there is more than enough oil just more money for the 1%
4003 2018-01-04 18:49:40 If Interior does execute any offshore leases they will be at rock bottom oil&gas prices, a huge giveaway to oil industry
4004 2018-01-04 18:49:39 The gov’t should start saving up now for the disaster relief our coastline will need after the oil spill that’ll inevitably occur.
4005 2018-01-04 18:49:32 Finally!  I was worried our oceans were going to get a little too clean and safe for life.  Also it’s about time we invest deeper in the power of the future:  Crude oil to refine and burn.  Ahh progress.

4008 2018-01-04 18:49:27 #Californians will have a lot to say about this, @JerryBrownGov won't let it happen. We've had major spills in the past, that's why we did away with major drilling off our coast. #SantaBarbara remember blobs of oil?
4009 2018-01-04 18:49:27 Well, they export most of the oil.
4010 2018-01-04 18:49:25 I say, let's put an oil drill outside of Mar-A-Lago and then see how he likes it. And they can pour their wastes into the drinking water there. After all the science regarding the dangers of pollution is all bunk, right?
4011 2018-01-04 18:49:22 Trump in the Oval: How do we quash this book news?

4027 2018-01-04 18:47:43 When will the oil search end and the clean energy begin. Feel like we're stuck in the 70's with our energy program. It's embarrassing
4028 2018-01-04 18:47:29 I should’ve been a chemist. I made this body butter that’s better than coconut oil alone. Babbbyyyyy when I say my skin is soooooo soft and I smell so good!! I may start making batches and start selling it 
4029 2018-01-04 18:47:26 Honorable Senator Nelson  , please keep the Feds away from allowing Big Oil to drill off of our beautiful shores !! They  " accidentally " spill sometimes .
4030 2018-01-04 18:47:22 In the last 24 hours, Americans learned that their worse fears about the #IPOTUS are true - he really is an idiot. In turn, the idiot opens up oil drilling anywhere and his moron SoJ declares war on pot! What the fuck are we waiting for, internment camps?? #RiseUp! #Resist!

4036 2018-01-04 18:47:06 Isn’t the whole point of republican philosophy “small government” ? That was the whole point in opening up the National parks to oil drilling right? But republicans also want the federal government to override state marijuana laws and jail people for smoking weed. Lies and money.
4037 2018-01-04 18:46:58 Did it ever occur to you that majority of people don’t agree with you?  America wants to be oil independent. Think about that for a second.
4038 2018-01-04 18:46:57 Hmm, wllh. Gaskiyane.

4052 2018-01-04 18:46:18 Sis you ever consider trying to go holistic? Cannibus oil is always good. GOD bless you bro
4053 2018-01-04 18:46:12 Central Calif coast is blanketed with marine sanctuaries, so even if draft oil and gas leasing plan is finalized without change, don't look for drilling of central Calif

4056 2018-01-04 18:45:53 Sad to say, no. Currently no known oil beds in thst area? Most in Fl are on the Gulf side of state.
4057 2018-01-04 18:45:35 Hummm....Sure,drill for oil right off the coast of Palm Beach near that’ll old fossil of a house,Mar-A-Largo!!! Let’s see how DT likes it!
4058 2018-01-04 18:45:35 Weight loss helped.I can’t seem to get good fat up. Take 2000 mg fish oil and 2000 flaxseed oil every day.

4060 2018-01-04 18:45:18 oil spills on Florida beaches. That should be popular.
4061 2018-01-04 18:45:16 Damn sorry to hear that man. Go to a doctor, stop smoking and buy some eucalyptus oil. Put it in a diffuser and breath it in. Will help your lungs immensely.

4063 2018-01-04 18:45:14 I’m just a big ball of oil. Adding any oil to my face causes a scene within 5 hours lol
4064 2018-01-04 18:44:48 That moment when you realize you’ve been ignoring emails from your mechanic, but he was informing you that it was time for an oil change. Oops.
4065 2018-01-04 18:44:36 "Is facepalm oil vegan?"  #vegan
4066 2018-01-04 18:44:34 Exactlyyyy haha. Iran was civilized, much more advanced in terms of progression to a westernized society, and somehow Iran went backwards right after the US tried to get someone bad in power there that wouldent nationalize the oil. It's a coincidence though right??? 
4067 2018-01-04 18:44:34 Here in Alaska we the people fought hard for 40 years to keep this from happening now this greedy bastard along with write in congresswoman Lisa Makowsky whose father’s mission was to continue to destroy Alaska for oil/gas worked with Koch Paid congressman Dan Sullivan To pass it

4071 2018-01-04 18:44:17 Oil is a big part of their economy
4072 2018-01-04 18:44:10 Aha. I’m working with a theory shared by @AgedBarrel that the fat in the chicken is sufficient and no additional oil is necessary.
4073 2018-01-04 18:44:05 i’m gonna stick my face in my oil diffuser
4074 2018-01-04 18:44:00 They're not exactly going to drill and just let oil leak everywhere.
4075 2018-01-04 18:43:57 I’m tired of paying 70+ dollars for my oil change 
4076 2018-01-04 18:43:54 I have no heat or hot water. I called 311 they said they have no info on emergency service to help. My building ran out of oil and my landlord is trying to resolve it but all oil companies are booked until sat. What should I do?

4079 2018-01-04 18:43:51 “Blue No. 1 is called "brilliant blue" and, as is typical of modern dyes, was originally derived from coal tar, although most manufacturers now make it from an oil base”. 

YUM
4080 2018-01-04 18:43:48 Get fracking out of Colorado! Toxic to the water, soil and air. Fracking is a losing deal for the people who live in CO!!! Once the GOP get voted out we can make regulations tougher on the big Oil and Gas industries. LEAVE Colorado!
4081 2018-01-04 18:43:40 Why?The last I heard we had an oil glut.What FACTS, specifically, support the need for this?As far as gasoline is concerned the lack of new refineries for at least the last 60 yrs and individual states requiring different formulas has caused gas shortage, increased pump prices.
4082 2018-01-04 18:43:29 I've been looking at the oil companies since 2009.
They're as rotten as they come.. they'll have no money if we quit buying their products..
4083 2018-01-04 18:43:27 The same goes for drilling.  In foreign countries they cut corners and more accidents happen (see Nigeria) which is worse on the environment that local drilling that is more regulated and causes less accidents.

We need oil.  But how we extract it makes a difference.
4084 2018-01-04 18:43:26 New Englanders now burning *OIL* to stay warm. As we speak, er, tweet.
4085 2018-01-04 18:43:22 Oil drilling off the coast isn't going to poll well for very wealthy people with homes along the beach. Issa & Rohrabacher might finally be toast.
4086 2018-01-04 18:43:10 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for moon dust balm, and put some hibiscus essential oil in my diffuser.
4087 2018-01-04 18:42:58 If you didn’t like offshore wind farms, get ready for oil and gas
4088 2018-01-04 18:42:53 Need a boy that uses coconut oil
4089 2018-01-04 18:42:42 Same goes for lowland at moment as well 

But we must remember wool is a sustainable product that's no use ,much better to use oil based materials
4090 2018-01-04 18:42:41 Coat thighs. For potatoes I would quarter and put olive oil and salt (and if not for me, pepper)
4091 2018-01-04 18:42:38 Why? Our nat income is lower because of our size. We have no natural resources like oil. Our land only grows corn, apples and grain. Besides: France has the same system, Germany, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Austria, Poland, Spain. Together the EU IS 400 million people.
4092 2018-01-04 18:42:38 Ha ha, leave you alone? Can give it out eh, not so good at receiving it. Perhaps dont store your cooking oil in a back lane.
4093 2018-01-04 18:42:34 Couldn’t agree more. You cannot waste whatever is left of value on this season. Even after season, you can’t overreact, but you also can’t hope and wish too many unproven players have breakout years.
4094 2018-01-04 18:42:28 Worth more to me than striking oil
4095 2018-01-04 18:42:25 Real men deep fry with they shirt off..  Lol we like the feeling of burning hot oil 
4096 2018-01-04 18:42:22 we didn't want america going to war with iraq, libya, syria, etc.  But it happened anyways, our country needs to be about americans NOT oil/gas/ pollution.
4097 2018-01-04 18:42:18 BREAKING: The Trump administration is proposing an unprecedented expansion of offshore oil and natural gas drilling that will encompass nearly all of the nation’s outer continental shelf, including areas off the coast of California for the first time in decades.
4098 2018-01-04 18:42:16 A hair oil 
4099 2018-01-04 18:41:58 Knowing that the work with Russia included Rex because of the oil trade, the Dakota pipeline and now tapping the whole of the US, I’m confident that Exxon is at least pulling some of the strings.

I’d love to be a roach on those walls.
4100 2018-01-04 18:41:54 CBD oil salve for skin issues also is great for cuts,  burns, & topical needs!

4102 2018-01-04 18:41:52 I have a friend who has been trying it for a few months for chronic pain and anxiety. She hasn't reported any success from the oil sans THC.
4103 2018-01-04 18:41:47 So pave paradise to put up a parking lot?  Log the rain forests to build more strip malls?  Wipe out endangered species for oil pipelines?  Rape our national parks for coal strip mines? Ignore global warming for short term gain & pure greed?  Your legacy is shame and ignorance!
4104 2018-01-04 18:41:38 Without oil, you wouldn't be tweeting right now. Your phone burns 32 gallons of gasoline each year for you to use it. Over 1 billion phones made every year producing 60 million tons of CO2 emissions.
4105 2018-01-04 18:41:37 La tin be so dusty she need pakana oil to make it shine
4106 2018-01-04 18:41:35 They're not a large economy. Specialize in oil, minerals and natural gas and selling weapons. Only developed country population has shrunk since cold war. GDP is only 1.28 trillion. Not a big economy at all
4107 2018-01-04 18:41:33 One way to up-level the masochism of running is to put peppermint essential oil in your tennis shoes. If your feet start to sweat you'll not only prevent weird smells, you'll also feel a tingling sensation that makes you go faster in order to get it over with so it all stops.
4108 2018-01-04 18:41:26 No man oil... What goes on tour...
4109 2018-01-04 18:41:24 68. "Love cannot endure indifference It needs to be wanted Like a lamp, it needs to be fed out of the oil of another's heart, or its flame burns low"#Retweet
4110 2018-01-04 18:41:05 One would think that the unions that represent the oil workers would oppose this as well.
4111 2018-01-04 18:41:01 With a little luck somebody will build a giant ugly oil platform right off the coast of Mar-a-Lago!
4112 2018-01-04 18:40:57 vaping helps also, cbd oil helped me... also if you slowly eliminate the cigs you take incremently instead of cold turkey, it’s easier
4113 2018-01-04 18:40:53 Coconut oil b4 i leave the house
4114 2018-01-04 18:40:50 Why? Are we running out of oil?
4115 2018-01-04 18:40:48 Humbly disagree. There are many victims. My family is destroyed bc of my son's usage of the oil that has caused significant psychosis. 3 car accidents, many arrests, in rehab now, but not after destroying my family.
4116 2018-01-04 18:40:37 The people will always be the PUPPETS of Treason by our Highest Officials
under the rumors of War or Red Flags like 9/11 under George Bush and a reason to reason to complete the circle SAUDI RUN OIL FIRM OF THE BUSH FAMILY. Nothing is too big for GLOBALIST BUSH FAMILY.
4117 2018-01-04 18:40:34 Awesome. That should tank oil and gas prices, putting further pressure on American producers. Meanwhile, many major auto manufacturers have planned or are planning for more electric and hybrid cars in their lineup.

(Thread: Recipe I use) PS. It's completely safe to eat and use as a lip scrub as well. Avoid eye area ofc.
4120 2018-01-04 18:40:27 Now oil drilling in almost all US coastal waters??! @realDonaldTrump and his choices for his cabinet are very simple - cash grab. Total BS and an environmental nightmare waiting to happen. Shrink protected areas within and around the US. Awful people.
4121 2018-01-04 18:40:22 え…エルザとは…別に…な…(ﾀﾞｯ
4122 2018-01-04 18:40:20 I’ve never come across one with in and around the north west  It must be bloody expensive to fry everything in animal fat rather than veg oil!
4123 2018-01-04 18:40:16 Liar. We need more local oil so we don't have to rely on people who hate us. You will never agree with anything NH Conservatives need.
4124 2018-01-04 18:40:15 It is a double edged sword, having worked in the oil and gas industry for over 25 years I know a few people who live in the states but use a foreign address in the country they work out of and have bank account to avoid trying to pay US taxes
4125 2018-01-04 18:40:13 So sad. Oil is at a surplus and energy prices are low. What is the purpose and why is this necessary?!  Let’s continue to rape our lands and natural resources for short term gains/profit

4128 2018-01-04 18:40:03 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
4129 2018-01-04 18:40:02 So drilling for oil in the oceans is fine, but smoking weed is the devil. Got it.
4130 2018-01-04 18:40:01 Good article. I have been a cooking fanatic these last few days.

4132 2018-01-04 18:39:51 The West White Rose offshore oil project will not have strikes or lockouts during construction; a new Special Project Order has been issued by the government. #nlpoli
4133 2018-01-04 18:39:47 Oh great. Expanded offshore drilling. More oil spills, more dead/polluted sea life/seafood. Great, great.
4134 2018-01-04 18:39:44 Not sure, haven’t had a chance to go through it just drawing on personal experience. Evaluating a Montney oil well that doesn’t report oil, but inflates the gas profile due to oil bookings is a source of frustration!

4137 2018-01-04 18:39:26 There are other reasons to be skeptical regarding oil&gas: oil spills, limited supply, air pollution, isn’t promoting democracy ...
4138 2018-01-04 18:39:25 One goal for this year is to buy oil paints and be nice wit it
4139 2018-01-04 18:39:22 Precisely. Any environmentalists or local activists who want to stop this need to make supply and demand work in their favor. If oil prices soar and it makes sense to leverage offshore reserves, oil cos. will find a way to get it done. Use alternatives to keep prices low.
4140 2018-01-04 18:39:15 Draft offshore oil and gas plan would start with leasing in Beaufort and Chukchi Seas in Arctic, follow later with areas in Pacific, Atlantic, eastern Gulf of Mexico
4141 2018-01-04 18:39:14 More than just cooperation issues: the source of almost all major conflicts in the past is (apart from religion) these kind of uneven resource distribution/dependencies: grain, oil, minerals etc. 
Let’s move towards autonomous regions instead as a viable scale for sust. energy
4142 2018-01-04 18:39:14 conservatives want you to starve and suffer, get sick with no treatment, never stop working, get covered in oil at the damn beach, and never ever get high or be able to chill for even one second unless you’re already rich

fuck em
4143 2018-01-04 18:39:08 Nixon was against drilling after SB oil spill. trump makes Nixon look like a great President.
4144 2018-01-04 18:39:08 Tea tree oil works wonders. Got a pimple or one arising, dab some tea tree oil on it and it’s gone 
4145 2018-01-04 18:39:03 My brother was a student at UC Santa Barbara during the big oil spill. Ugh.
4146 2018-01-04 18:38:56 Maybe you should talk to Saudis - they had a huge flourishing slave trade business for 1000s of years before Britain - they are very rich selling oil to us which we discovered - surely they will help
4147 2018-01-04 18:38:51 Oil spot would have to be $100+ before they drill there...
4148 2018-01-04 18:38:48 Kinda wanna buy an Apple Watch but I also needed an oil change and alignment like 6000 miles ago sooo
4149 2018-01-04 18:38:31 Well, for starters, N. Korea is a totalitarian dictatorship. As for S. America, I know countries like Venezuela get brought up a lot, even though a lot of the problems there are due to overdependence on oil and the fact that there is only at most about 40 percent public ownership
4150 2018-01-04 18:38:20 So many different forms of energy and these morons want to drill for more oil? There are literally COUNTRIES that are planning to faze out gasoline yet the USA has to get more of it. All that deregulation helped those coal miners right? Can’t wait to have oily shores too #swamp
4151 2018-01-04 18:38:17 I would be so down for this. And loop @jiatolentino in too after her amazing piece!  is life, as is face oil. I’m also really enjoying explosion of more natural beauty products (can you tell skincare shopping is my stress release?)
4152 2018-01-04 18:38:16 2/2 if not true, then ask the question, why is Westminster always going out of its way to ensure Scotland remains in the UK. They moved the Sea Border to give England more oil fields. Many businesses use central bookkeeping making it impossible to gauge Scottish Export ie Diageo

4158 2018-01-04 18:37:50 They’ll desperately try to coverup massive oil spills.
4159 2018-01-04 18:37:49 no more drilling off shore; have they forgot the gulf disaster.  anything man made is prone to errors.  the oil industry has had how many accidents?  this is just as bad as drilling in the arctic.  we can't allow this to happen to CA.  why must gop destroy everything good?

4171 2018-01-04 18:37:04 Mink oil is my go-to. I use it on leather soles and uppers, just apply and let it soak in repeatedly
4172 2018-01-04 18:37:03 I really hope we don't lose power w/ these 60-70 mph winds and blizzard. We only have 50 gallons of oil and no one's allowed on the roads so the oil we were supposed to get today isn't coming. We have to try at 8am tomorrow morning.

4177 2018-01-04 18:36:21 Don't get too high on yourself, there dutch. You have a nation with a population smaller than New York City, and you struck huge oil reserves in the north sea.....

Pretty easy to be successful considering the circumstances.

4184 2018-01-04 18:35:47 It is time to face facts, #45 is selling us off to the highest bidder.  Between Russia, the NAZI SKINHEADS, and BIG OIL, our Country is falling apart.  How do we teach our children to be proud of "The USA" when it is like this?  God help us!!!
4185 2018-01-04 18:35:45 Damn I should of called on y’all when I needed to see if my girl was leaking oil

4187 2018-01-04 18:35:33 Energy independence is absolutely essential, so we are not funding directly/indirectly terrorism, repression,dictatorships around the globe. We can  fine tune our carbon emissions by controlling our own oil., rather than exporting the problem or our dollars. @TuckerCarlson @POTUS

4194 2018-01-04 18:35:00 Why? With all of the alternative energy sources and low oil price already, why would we risk more damage to our environment?
4195 2018-01-04 18:34:53 * Trump administration proposes massive expansion of offshore oil drilling
* Plan would open 90% of offshore areas for drilling starting in 2019, up from 6% under previous plan #oott

4203 2018-01-04 18:34:24 50-25% pullback rotation on daily chart isnt happening on oil of late. just one directional train like bitcoin.
4204 2018-01-04 18:34:20 In the 1920's and 1930's the beaches around Santa Barbara were practically covered with tar from natural seeps.  That's how Coal Oil Point got its name. Lots of seeps on land, too, both oil and gas.
4205 2018-01-04 18:34:17 I hate how fried Kate Hudson’s hair in How to Lose A Guy In 10 Days is... like I really might stop watching bc of it. Can somebody give her some coconut oil?!
4206 2018-01-04 18:34:08 Actually, I may just do the same, and build a new factory using oil and the new electric furnaces I've got >:3
4207 2018-01-04 18:34:05 Just like weed butter and oil gives you two complete different types of high vs weed sugar and actually rolling up.
4208 2018-01-04 18:34:01 of course it will.  nothing better than surfing in toxic oil/tar that leaks from those rigs.
4209 2018-01-04 18:33:53 a complete pay off by oil to #TrumpCrimeSyndicate. tillerson involved??
4210 2018-01-04 18:33:51 Current status: About 55 degrees in the house. We can get some emergency oil if they can get here, roads still aren't clear. I think we'll be OK either way. We are not personally in danger of flooding but it's gonna be a fun weekend. Some of the footage from downtown is scary.
4211 2018-01-04 18:33:44 From behind a rotting wood door, you hear a snarl. An oil lamp lies discarded nearby.

4216 2018-01-04 18:33:37 Adulting is trash! Who knew a tire rotation, oil change, and anti-freeze flush would cost so much! It’s 6 degrees and I’m out here sweating. I might have a heart attack! I’m so sick!
4217 2018-01-04 18:33:37 the fun thing about waiting way too long to change your oil is every time u get an oil change it feels like getting a new car!!

4220 2018-01-04 18:33:27 Last night's stream was awesome. @ViceroyFett and @TheInstinct43 thanks for burning the midnight oil with me!
4221 2018-01-04 18:33:24 i figured out how many oil barrels of semen ive ejaculated since i was probably about 12 its really easy to figure out when you consider that the average male jackets at least a teaspoon and a half then you can do the conversion 2 gallons of a lot of sperm.
4222 2018-01-04 18:33:21 @jeffsessions I take CBD oil with ZERO THC in it. I can only get this at a dispensary. I use it to manage pain caused by ddd, 2 back surgeries and several other back procedures. Educate yourself. It is literally MEDICINE. And NOOOOO, it isn’t the same as heroin.
4223 2018-01-04 18:33:10 The tar from those Texas beaches are usually due to natural seeps of oil in the Gulf.  About the equivalent of 2 Exxon Valdez loads of oil seep naturally into the Gulf every year.  They used to have a severe problem around Santa Barbara, CA until drilling there relieved it.
4224 2018-01-04 18:33:08 Just the vape. I still have some oil left from when I tried to use a pen, but I'm told I'd get on better with a box so that's what I'm looking at now. As things stand I'm considering buying one called an Oceanus just so I can scratch out the OCE.
4225 2018-01-04 18:33:03 Oil allready is very cheap right now....
4226 2018-01-04 18:33:02 Trump administration moves to expand oil and gas drilling off off the coast of California, other U.S. waters -- Los Angeles Times
4227 2018-01-04 18:33:00 Without the oil platform, that pic could be mistaken for one of Lake Erie at the moment. 
4228 2018-01-04 18:33:00 We are currently importing our oil from places like Saudi Arabia.
Also your comment about the safest way to transport is utterly false. Pipelines are by far the safest way to transport bitumen. Ask
@OilsandsAction @PipelineAction @CanadaAction
4229 2018-01-04 18:32:58 the next admin needs to during their administration get us off of oil.
PERIOD .. not with in the "next 20 years" or some bullshit like that .. Off of it .. 
Once current land based wells are dried up the industry is gone.
Congress needs to lead  if POTUS won't VETO proof ppl
4230 2018-01-04 18:32:56 Trump doesn’t care one way or the other. It’s @EPAScottPruitt working feverishly to get all the oil and gas industry has dreamed of done before tRump implodes.
4231 2018-01-04 18:32:50 What a joke! You think they care about the NFL? They want their family member back. They want to know that their family members death was because he/she was fighting to protect the lives in american and not because of oil and/or power.
4232 2018-01-04 18:32:48 Of course Trump would approve oil drilling in the Arctic. He doesn’t have any coastal golf courses there that oil spills could befoul.
4233 2018-01-04 18:32:41 Ah. Then what is your point? I know she's not in office. We all know that. What might I be thinking about? Tweeting daily to our current global leaders? Yep, @HillaryClinton & @PutinRF_Eng need to start acting like adults, shake hands, and stop all Oil production NOW please!
4234 2018-01-04 18:32:27 Uncle Sam likely to become the biggest Oil Giant globally in the foreseeable future!
4235 2018-01-04 18:32:21 I use 130g to 1000ml of coconut oil. Elderly people need lower dosage.
4236 2018-01-04 18:32:21 @realDonaldTrump hope oil is discovered in Mar-a-Lago
4237 2018-01-04 18:32:05 Anytime Midnight Oil - Beds are Burning comes on I'm all in @BenningtonShow
4238 2018-01-04 18:32:00 Trump has said the oil is there for the taking. All "we" have to do is take it. Which means he intends to take it. He will probably find a way to siphon off the profits for his personal wealth.
4239 2018-01-04 18:31:57 How can you open all coastal waters to oil drillers? You are a sellout and will destroy our oceans. Nice legacy.  #SaveOurOcean
4240 2018-01-04 18:31:55 To me, the right move is Sekera.
Mtl needs the defensive help, Weber is out, they have difficulty transitioning from D to O. Their blueline here was a mess. 
Helps both clubs, and I think the Oil have the D depth to facilitate this now.

4244 2018-01-04 18:31:41 Of course, and with all those eliminated drilling regulations, how long will it be before spilled oil hits our beaches?
4245 2018-01-04 18:31:40 Time to buy stock in baby oil!
4246 2018-01-04 18:31:36 Much like Hillary Clinton, @realDonaldTrump may not be the best human on the planet, but his policies are certainly strong... Tax Cuts, Keep Out Illegals (not legal immigrants), and Drilling for more Oil!  #Thanks
4247 2018-01-04 18:31:35 Proper protocols? Please, you don't really believe that. An oil spill can quite literally wipe out a large portion of human food and/or contaminate it...and you're willing to let them just pay that away? Why take an unnecessary risk?
4248 2018-01-04 18:31:34 The basic flaw in this is that oil is shrinking in profitability. Expanding into costly production areas is a lose-lose situation for the industry.
4249 2018-01-04 18:31:22 Correct, even when Mexico was rich in oil during the first half of the 20th century, they weren't innovators. After 1970, Mexicans came to the US in droves, my grandparents came during a time workers were needed, today we welcome moochers and government takers.
4250 2018-01-04 18:31:09 @marcorubio When oil is lapping up on the shores of Florida, maybe you can show some "deep concern".
4251 2018-01-04 18:31:07 So what is the purpose of stameta,castor oil, Mr Alba etc?
4252 2018-01-04 18:31:06 The Trump administration is poised to open the door to selling new offshore drilling rights from the Atlantic Ocean to the Arctic Sea, igniting a fight with coastal residents worried about oil spills befouling beaches and jeopardizing tourism dollars.

Please give me money!
4255 2018-01-04 18:30:39 The confusion also lies in free oil or condensate at the wellhead vs condy or C2+ extracted from the gas stream at a gas plant. There are places where oil gets counted as condensate and accounted for in the gas stream as gas equivalents! Wacky stuff
4256 2018-01-04 18:30:38 Nice. This will create jobs and hopefully lower the price of oil for Americans.
4257 2018-01-04 18:30:34 "In front of anything but 'tanning oil'." @GinaGrad on @adamcarolla saying if you put 'Hawaiian' in front of anything, it's worse.

4260 2018-01-04 18:30:23 We can't even set up a national oil fund. Instead it just gets squandered by Westminster economic mismanagement and used to pay off UK government debt.

4. Remove chicken from the pan and set aside.
4269 2018-01-04 18:29:50 Oil & gas companies don’t want to be the next Deepwater Horizon. They have the proper protocols in place to prevent these incidents from happening, and if there is an accident they have the financial means to address it. Deregulation is good for business.
4270 2018-01-04 18:29:49 Crowdsource opportunity: Oil platform right off the coast of Mar-A-Lago. As near as legally possible.
4271 2018-01-04 18:29:48 Get House Members to visit an active crude oil spill site and walk around.

4290 2018-01-04 18:28:22 Trump's @interior dept plans to offer offshore oil leases across entire CA coast - in north, central and southern CA planning areas.
4291 2018-01-04 18:28:12 What could go wrong with oil drilling off all the coast of America 
4292 2018-01-04 18:28:10 Dept. of Interior estimates 3 bil barrels of oil + 30 tril cubic ft of natural gas is recoverable on OCS. That's a lot of potential tax revenue for states and a lot of new jobs.

4294 2018-01-04 18:27:44 It taking me 35 years to have truffle oil on french fries was wrong and I'm sorry.
4295 2018-01-04 18:27:42 Yes just what we all want to look at when we drive to the coast, exploding oil derricks and the steelhead fish poisoned, king and Dungeness stocks depleted. Yay, can't wait
4296 2018-01-04 18:27:41 Kiss those beautiful beaches and marine life good bye. Drumft pays back his big donor oil tycoons at a huge cost to our planet. Alaska too is being ravaged by their greed
4297 2018-01-04 18:27:22 Why you just have to keep up by keeping it oil and do treatments
4298 2018-01-04 18:27:19 Don’t push yourself so hard. Pace it out and aim to lose a pound a week. That’s what I’m doing now. All you’d have to do is make small changes for that. Like using flora light instead of butter, more water, diet sodas if anything, fry light instead of oil with cooking...
4299 2018-01-04 18:27:14 And how many jobs and how many billions of dollars are we pissing away by doubling down on coal & oil instead of getting out in front of renewable energy sources & new technologies that the rest of the world is embracing?
4300 2018-01-04 18:27:11 I suggest tea tree oil. It’s inexpensive and easy to find. It worked for me
4301 2018-01-04 18:27:09 Pretty sure that just about every urban planner dreams of applying market principles to urban transportation problems. Many are susceptible to Big Oil/Detroit propaganda, but that's orthogonal, and does not diminish their "socialism for me, the pollution for thee" approach.

4317 2018-01-04 18:25:57 It’s becoming the predictable & most dangerous thing about @realDonaldTrump. Every time a news story points toward his incompetence, a few hours later he releases an explosive story to recapture headlines. Today? Bannon’s revelations give way to ‘more oil drilling please!’
4318 2018-01-04 18:25:56 My wife's father had about 500 aches of land in swamp n Miami with an Airport on it & they found oil on her land.Wife was railroaded from her will & the land was stolen & so was her Inheritance.Her Airport & land now is a Animal Reserve.Janet Reno & Clinton's was involved I hear.
4319 2018-01-04 18:25:52 I am telling you we have enough wells and pipelines. If you want to ship oil out of country transport it with lasting jobs not pipelines. Truck and train transport spill less combined in one year than one pipeline in a day.
4320 2018-01-04 18:25:50 So your plan is to keep buying oil from people who want to kill us. You Senator are nothing more than an extreme far left hack.
4321 2018-01-04 18:25:37 Read up on Nuclear fusion and Nuclear fission reactors before you keep talking about some kind of "need" for oil that does not truly exist outside of politics (those being paid by oil companies)
4322 2018-01-04 18:25:35 Oh yes! We all know what happened to Georgi Markov. 
Apparently, Lexi has a large collection of castor oil plants in her caravan.

4323 2018-01-04 18:25:35 Yoon MSM tell us...
If oil price is low that's bad news for Scotland
If oil price is high that's also bad news for Scotland

4324 2018-01-04 18:25:31 For many, many years California has paid a good deal more in taxes to the Feds than they've gotten in return.  Energy? We're already ahead of the curve on Solar and other renewable, sustainable power sources. We have our own oil & are ramping up desalinization efforts.
4325 2018-01-04 18:25:30 How far does your loyalty go?
I stopped counting the miles on mine. Now I gotta change the oil and paint a new coat for shine.
#Loyalty
4326 2018-01-04 18:25:30 Surely with the oil money in the game now and the way the club is ran I think they decided to go back and identify talent hence bringing on the likes of mistilant from Dortmund.....
4327 2018-01-04 18:25:25 There's going to be no midnight oil left after I burn it all tonight
4328 2018-01-04 18:25:21 I want to like this again. My face is slick with oil every damn night now, and my skin’s never been better
4329 2018-01-04 18:25:17 what kind of oil do you recommend?
4330 2018-01-04 18:25:12 We roam ahead and turn out of where you see
I can’t hear the heart, this old oil stain
4331 2018-01-04 18:25:11 Who will be first to put an oil rig right off Mar-a-lago?
4332 2018-01-04 18:25:10 Oil companies want to start more drilling so they can flood the market and make less money. Not.
4333 2018-01-04 18:25:04 Sprinkle a little salt in your pan if you're frying. This will prevent the oil from splattering.
4334 2018-01-04 18:25:01 Nice work. Just got myself some beard oil.... #firstimer
4335 2018-01-04 18:24:58 Fish oil is about to take on a whole new meaning...
4336 2018-01-04 18:24:56 LMAO this oil change chart is perfect Lol
4337 2018-01-04 18:24:56 My car is a big pain in my ass! I need an oil change, 2 new tires and a new windshield  my next car will be leased bc I hate having to go outta my way to do this shit & pay my $. When it’s leased the dealer takes car of all that
4338 2018-01-04 18:24:53 Yeah, I was just sayin' to the Missus the other day, "We haven't killed nearly enough sea birds, otters, and other wildlife with a think coating of tarry oil lately."

/s
4339 2018-01-04 18:24:50 Nobody will drill there if oil prices stay as long as they have been.

4341 2018-01-04 18:24:45 I was hoping there was a tea tree remedy bc thats what i use to wash my hair how much oil do u use?
4342 2018-01-04 18:24:41 With US set to become the oil king in 2018 supplemented by the abundant reserves of 'Shale gas', the reason for US pulling out of the 'Paris climate deal' appears pellucid.
4343 2018-01-04 18:24:40 For a big, beautiful oil spill, on a regular basis, no doubt.
4344 2018-01-04 18:24:32 BREAKING: Trumps to open most U.S. coastal waters to new #oil drilling - #OOTT
4345 2018-01-04 18:24:24 Couldn't agree more.  Jersey Shore + oil don't mix
4346 2018-01-04 18:24:20 Totally spot on if it is’t oil spills Rubio is bathing himself in sugar. Yet the Floridans in pan handle keep voting for people who don’t care about there well being. Like our governor or Rubio. Remember there no future in oil.
4347 2018-01-04 18:24:18 Nuclear can literally power everything and yes oil will be obsolete
4348 2018-01-04 18:24:14 Correct. If anything they probably want to start drilling less soon like OPEC did because they were losing revenue with low oil prices.
4349 2018-01-04 18:24:08 canola oil is the worst oil for you...
4350 2018-01-04 18:23:59 Shane made brownies and used AVOCADO OIL bc we didn’t have any vegetable oil. 

It didn’t turn out well.
4351 2018-01-04 18:23:57 Can you imagine what the oil filter industry would do if we had to replace our filters every... Oh.
4352 2018-01-04 18:23:52 @Interior: 19 OCS lease sales off Alaska, starting with Chukchi/Beaufort. Trump admin intends to continue ban on oil lease sales in North Aleutian basin/Bristol Bay.
4353 2018-01-04 18:23:51 And his billionaire oil buddies!
4354 2018-01-04 18:23:50 I don't get it.  Oil is already priced low.  Who is eager to drill for this?
4355 2018-01-04 18:23:47 Ambitious is one way to describe it.  Another way to describe it would be catastrophe waiting to happen.  Oil and gas lobbyist definitely got their money's worth with this guy...
4356 2018-01-04 18:23:34 Lesson from the 1970s.
Pretend oil is worth more than real oil -until it isn't!
4357 2018-01-04 18:23:28 With that generator we can clean up our environment reduce the amount of fossil fuel vehicles and stabilize the economy and maybe even end wars over oil??
4358 2018-01-04 18:23:23 How does it save money? And if you actually think they'll be drilling next you've had too much to drink again. Oil field development can take 10 years or so & even then they won't develop in these areas b/c they know Dems will reinstitute the bans
4359 2018-01-04 18:23:23 today i woke up to no work, slept in, woke up cuddling auggie & made maple cinnamon banana steel cut oatmeal/caramel truffle tea for bfast. my hair smells like veganese conditioner . my body smells like chamomile/lavender oil. i am having a 10/10 good day, thanks for listening
4360 2018-01-04 18:23:23 Cbd oil stops seizures in children and dogs .. now they want to take the access away and drive the cost up ???
4361 2018-01-04 18:23:22 Sure, I’m relieved that I went for an oil change and was told my car looks pretty good. Howmstever, I don’t relax ever lmao. a shame
4362 2018-01-04 18:23:19 Baby, it's cold outside.... but the price of oil ended 2017 at $60.12 a barrel, up +12% (and $6.40 a barrel) from its 2016 close of $53.72. The $60.12 price was the first daily close above $60 a  barrel since 6/24/15 (source: CME Group).
4363 2018-01-04 18:23:03 Not 'your land' but also part of Judaism. U haven't done much with 'your land' but suck oil; kill your own. Bye
4364 2018-01-04 18:23:03 He is. I see heavy smoker's pov, but I also know the real tragic effects to people as well. Hemp oil works the same w/o psychotropic effects. Is it the effects people want badly or the real benefits. The psychotropics can kill people & be worse than hard drugs.
4365 2018-01-04 18:23:01 Ni nini amekosa? Ni Biblia ama ni mtu wa kumbebea Biblia?
4366 2018-01-04 18:23:00 Interior Department says no oil drilling lease sales in eastern Gulf of Mexico until 2023, after moratorium through 2022 expires. "I look forward to having that dialogue with Gov. Scott  — I know him well," Interior @SecretaryZinke says.
4367 2018-01-04 18:23:00 Yeah, the oil industry pays  $26.4 billion in tax in California alone moron.  Probably the only thing keeping California going.
4368 2018-01-04 18:22:58 You should look into Standing Rock. Amy Goodman, host of Democracy Now, was slapped a 40 year sentence for holding a camera. Charges were thrown out in court but this is serious.
The only violence in Standing Rock was by the militarized oil companies. Looked like Iraq.
4369 2018-01-04 18:22:53 The Emirate of Abu Dhabi has intensified its movements in the eastern province of Hadar Mott, to strengthen its influence in the largest provinces of Yemen, and rich in oil.
4370 2018-01-04 18:22:52 seems like the gulf of mexico has recovered from disastrous drilling accident a few years ago.maybe the oil companies are learning from their mistakes(unlike politicians).
4371 2018-01-04 18:22:50 Does no one remember having to scrub oil add your feet with gasoline, at the beaches, back in the 70s? Nothing like a beautiful sunset at the beach with oil rigs on the horizon.
4372 2018-01-04 18:22:47 His promise to put miners to work. You never heard of oil mining? He just invented it.
4373 2018-01-04 18:22:45 Think of it this way, if oil companies want to sell gas in the state, they have to pay workers to pump it, and minimum wage is $11.75, rising to $15 over the next couple years. It's a tax that's also a jobs program.
4374 2018-01-04 18:22:42 Also it's called moisturize and hair oil lol 
4375 2018-01-04 18:22:34 The morning after a relatively-mild earthquake is a great time to announce off-shore California oil drilling. I’m certain there will be no issues when a much-stronger one strikes. Fracking hasn’t affected Oklahoma’s tectonics at all! @SecretaryZinke, you fucking ponce.
4376 2018-01-04 18:22:31 @Se_Railway can you please oil the squeaky tables on all Kent service trains
4377 2018-01-04 18:22:25 Shoutout al tea tree oil.
4378 2018-01-04 18:22:11 There’s only so much oil beneath our feet. Based on current rates of consumption and proven reserves, we’ve got enough for another 50-200 years. The sooner we ween ourselves off of oil to something renewable and environmentally-friendly, the better.
4379 2018-01-04 18:22:06 98% (!) of remaining undiscovered oil/natural resources off of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) will be up for leasing. Wow.
4380 2018-01-04 18:22:00 Get on that hemp oil shampoo fam, it's the goat
4381 2018-01-04 18:21:59 I literally need cbd oil for my severe stomach problems. Without it, I have to resort to being in pain crippled over because I don't believe in taking any pharmaceutical when there's an all natural solution. Please don't take my medicine.
4382 2018-01-04 18:21:52 About time! Enough foreign oil. Love this administration. Build the wall!!! & cut all funding for Sanctuary Cities...would be a wonderful start to 2018.
4383 2018-01-04 18:21:43 Republicans just want a small federal government with a $700 billion dollar defense budget that forces states to allow huge oil companies to drill in their local waters and sends SWAT teams in to raid small businesses in states that have laws they don't like. That's all.
4384 2018-01-04 18:21:31 As precious and as important crude oil, gold, or silver may be, they are somewhat useless until they're refined!
4385 2018-01-04 18:21:31 Politeness Is The Oil Which Reduces The Friction Against Each Other.
4386 2018-01-04 18:21:21 Ameeeen..!!!
4387 2018-01-04 18:21:20 Back to work next week to serve the public. Think I'm going have 2 shooters of castor oil for ol times sake.
4388 2018-01-04 18:21:16 Climate denial is a big threat to the planet, along with big oil itself.
4389 2018-01-04 18:21:13 BOEM's offshore leasing plan would offer acreage projected to hold 90 billion barrels of oil, 319 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. (For comparison ,areas open now projected to hold 56 billion barrels, 147 TCF)
4390 2018-01-04 18:21:08 I get my Nordics confused.  Anyhow.  Oil profits are used as a sovereign wealth fund.
4391 2018-01-04 18:21:04 I'm from Mi and just as concerned. Approx 60 superfund sites here alread and Enbridge line 5 oil carrier thru the Mackinac straits.
4392 2018-01-04 18:20:50 Oil is a global commodity if production in one piece falls other places make up the difference the only change is price (which is already going up)... so no impact other than slightly higher oil prices
4393 2018-01-04 18:20:47 What I find amusing is that @SecretaryZinke thinks the #OffshoreWindFarms are messing with #fishermen and yet he's proposing leasing 47% of #ContinentalShelf to #oil companies for #Drilling rigs.
4394 2018-01-04 18:20:31 That would be good if they do but don’t be expecting large differences. The HMRC provide estimates as well from the data they hold and they’re very close to GERS. 

You’ll be aware that they tightened up@on oil revenue estimates last year and it turns out that oil revenues
4395 2018-01-04 18:20:21 I mean really.... WTF
4396 2018-01-04 18:20:18 Instead of manufacturing and research for renewal energy Trump is doing Koch bidding to keep on supporting oil that's so the Koch's will keep on raking in money
4397 2018-01-04 18:20:17 what's the fluid? cooking oil? 

I think the closest parallel is gas prices which have, historically, been a key indicator - often referenced in political debates.
4398 2018-01-04 18:20:10 "Big nuclear button," oil drilling leases, and marijuana enforcement all seem to be desperate acts of a wounded animal knowing its about to succumb to the hunter.
4399 2018-01-04 18:20:05 See ehn. When olive oil can change your genotype why won’t retweet make you a billionaire
4400 2018-01-04 18:20:03 Why are oil changes so expensive
4401 2018-01-04 18:20:01 They've been telling us for 50 years the oil will only last another ten years. 
Complete rubbish. 
BP Are investing massive amounts, and they wouldn't being doing that for just ten years production.
4402 2018-01-04 18:19:50  Coconut oil READY #blizzard2018
4403 2018-01-04 18:19:43 Only at night in rural areas. Glad all of those jobs won't be lost. Other states should consider the lobbying that went on by try he oil companies to remove thus job in their states.
4404 2018-01-04 18:19:41 Worst company ever @atlasglenmor - all deliveries & techs have been canceled until tomorrow at earliest. They made deliveries today until a short while ago yet didn't for a 30+ year loyal customer out of oil. Good riddance. #FAIL #oilheat #heating #oil #YouHadOneJob
4405 2018-01-04 18:19:38 No, its scripture. Better to see it in context:
To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness, that they might be called trees of righteousness... (Is 61:3)
4406 2018-01-04 18:19:36 just think, that investment in lead, SEAL training and gun oil will last you more than a lifetime . . .
4407 2018-01-04 18:19:31 I really want to go get an oil change today, but that requires a lot of effort and energy I don’t have right now.
4408 2018-01-04 18:19:31 It’s brutal. Fans need to be even more supportive when things go bad, than when they are good. I watched the oil win five cups, it’s easy to be a fan then. Right now they need the support that isn’t easy to give, Not this cowardly bs.    #LetsGoOilers
4409 2018-01-04 18:19:30 I love my job and everything but that ole oil patch might be calling me back.... 
4410 2018-01-04 18:19:28 Ignorance at its finest. Hair growth don’t see color just genetics and if your black coconut oil.
4411 2018-01-04 18:19:14 I used to do A/R / payables & payroll for a few oil companies. I like to be organized. 

And I write on questionable receipts. Hyper organized sometimes. Lol

4414 2018-01-04 18:19:03 and while "we" were bombing North Korea, "we" were nullifying a democratic election in IRAN, to protect the big oil companies from "nationalization"; & installing the SHAH- in place of an elected President. AIN'T 'WE' SOMETHING?  ^..^
4415 2018-01-04 18:19:01 I believe that, automotive industry is still focusing on the wrong direction. Important thing in a motion physics is reducing the friction instead of reducing oil consumption. So, it will be better to focus on electromagnetic technology rather than wheel based motion dynamics.
4416 2018-01-04 18:18:52 Drill Baby Drill !!! End our dependence on foreign oil...and their bullshit
4417 2018-01-04 18:18:49 Their is chemicals in snow. Lol like gas and oil etc.  I’m doing orangic compound samples which those substances can cause problems.
4418 2018-01-04 18:18:44 The only way Oil companies would go after this is for future development. Trumpers probably think oil companies are going to pay millions to rig contractors just to drill for the heck of it.
4419 2018-01-04 18:18:37 Good! It is amazing plant! Created by GOD! UNLIKE Alcohol>100% more destructive with NO health benefits (except maybe wine, when not abused) So MUCH Beneficial things come from THIS PLANT. Medicine, food (Omega Oil&seed fiber with healthy benefits), cosmetics, even cloth, etc!
4420 2018-01-04 18:18:35 @PetroleumMin @AsoRock  So, I bought fuel at N200 today at World Oil, oke-ilewo, Abk.
4421 2018-01-04 18:18:16 Thats “olive oil”
4422 2018-01-04 18:18:08 @realDonaldTrump So now you’re allowing oil drilling indiscriminately: you really are out to destroy as much as you can of the US, for greed? Sad.
4423 2018-01-04 18:17:59 Might wanna chat with your buddy Putin & the other NK oil trader Xi.

4427 2018-01-04 18:17:50 For the ladies who can’t cook. Imma teach y’all something real quick. Order take out, chop up some onions and garlic and put in a pan of oil.. cook that for like 8 mins. While doing so get the take out and put it on plates and throw away all evidence....
4428 2018-01-04 18:17:48 It's hard to fund terror operations and invasions of Ukraine with low oil prices.  Easy to run a booming economy on them, however.
4429 2018-01-04 18:17:42 How does @realDonaldTrump have the authority to tweet a decision to drill for oil  & gas off ALL US waters & it is so?

Why isn't Congress involved in any of these decisions?

@SenCoryGardner @All100Senators @RepKenBuck @RepMikeCoffman @RepTipton @RepLamborn @HouseGOP @SenateGOP
4430 2018-01-04 18:17:38 Again this is about children's health, and most of these drugs offered are for serious medical conditions for which there is NO EFFECTIVE NATUROPATHIC TREATMENT THAT ISN'T SNAKE OIL. Your continuing to insist on naturopath over modern medicine is insanity.
4431 2018-01-04 18:17:32 Drill baby drill!!! No more relying on other countries for oil. Omg. The global warming!!!! Meanwhile it’s snowing in Tallahassee.

4438 2018-01-04 18:16:35 America Did not it cause a lot of confusion when you bought oil from the Middle East? Can you tell.
4439 2018-01-04 18:16:33 That’s the best they’ve got.  May is a well-known weasel word long used by advertisers and snake oil salesmen of every stripe to appear to be making a claim, but in reality making no claim at all that could hold up to scientific scrutiny.
4440 2018-01-04 18:16:23 No shit he is trying to get in good with oil billionaires
4441 2018-01-04 18:16:20 I’m pissed I fell asleep early last night and didn’t get to pick up tree but have 11 grams of oil but I’m still pissed I want to smoke weed dammit

4463 2018-01-04 18:14:17 About my car? What does that have to do with drilling oil in an industry trending towards electric cars?
4464 2018-01-04 18:14:09 Yes,  but apparently you need to add/check the oil more than every 20 years. 
4465 2018-01-04 18:14:08 Wow optional ?? Are you kidding me  with a record like the Oil you’d think these should be mandatory.
4466 2018-01-04 18:14:06 Getting your oil changed is kind of like signing up for the inquisition #whatyougotinyerpockets
4467 2018-01-04 18:14:05 If Trump has his way, we will be back burning coal and dumping the poisons into streams as previous. Solar, battery, wind power. Enough dependency on oil. We are so far behind!!

4473 2018-01-04 18:13:50 Sky is definitely not falling and any “fan” that thinks it is can’t read simple stats. The Oil had 3 more wins after 40 games last season. That’s ONE win per month. If the home PK is just average, 15th instead of 31st they likely have 3 more wins this season. 27-13-2 can be done.

4478 2018-01-04 18:13:37 Today the Trump Administration said it would pursue oil drilling off the Pacific coast, would reverse a hands-off policy towards states with legal pot laws, and said political leaders of sanctuary cities should be jailed.

In other words, Trump declared war on California.

4481 2018-01-04 18:13:26 True, but IMO even unlucky academics are overall quite lucky (even putting aside salary). 

My brother, who is now 40, works on oil rigs. He once dodged a falling instrument at the last moment (crushed the tip of his boot).

4503 2018-01-04 18:12:18 This will be great for the entire economy.  Most of the oil offshore of California can now be reached from wells on shore, though, due to advances in horizontal drilling, but seismic faults probably put the kabosh on some of that.
4504 2018-01-04 18:12:12 Beach views will be wonderful with all the new oil platforms sitting a mile offshore

4507 2018-01-04 18:12:11 Likewise it's better to let other countries bear the environmental and other costs to produce oil, as long as we can leave our country pristine, and feel self righteous about opposing drilling.  How selfish and arrogant!
4508 2018-01-04 18:12:08 Where do all the important Republicans have their seaside properties? Because I'm going to start drilling for oil directly in front of every one.

4525 2018-01-04 18:11:10 Why do they insist on keeping doing this? Oil as a propellant for vehicles will be completely obsolete in 25-30 years. The demand for oil will lower way before that, sending the price of oil into a tailspin. Only silver lining here is that offshore exploration is expensive.

4594 2018-01-04 18:06:45 Actually, the real reason there won't be major drilling expansion is economics. Shale oil will keep WTI prices low enough for long enough that offshore drilling is likely to be unattractive.

4602 2018-01-04 18:06:00 can get a quarter of oil for cheaper than that 
4603 2018-01-04 18:05:53 Not only that, but with the military testing bases lining the coastal waters and space launches going on we don’t need seated oil rigs and potential explosions mixing.
4604 2018-01-04 18:05:53 What?! I've been pumping gas for decades! My dad always told me that driving is a LUXURY, not a necessity, and if I wanted to drive that I better be able to pump my own gas, change a tire and do my own oil change...this was mastered prior to even being allowed to get my license!

4606 2018-01-04 18:05:24 An important thing to take note of is having CLEAN edges. Yes, clean edges. You wouldn’t do your skincare routine on a dirty face, so why pile oil on an unclean hairline?

4611 2018-01-04 18:05:06 I don't think they realize they could pipe the oil market further
4612 2018-01-04 18:05:05 it could potentially add more oil to the global market, lower prices that way. (very small amount) 

It will not seriously effect prices in the USofA as you are thinking. We will always be subject to the huge prices swings, no matter what
4613 2018-01-04 18:05:03 Typical @STVNews, headlining petrol price rises instead of continuing oil price rise (only briefly mentioned) but when oil was $30 a barrel it dominated the news.
4614 2018-01-04 18:04:55 Right...and I have to imagine it takes some time (years?) to construct a new offshore oil rig? No clue really...
4615 2018-01-04 18:04:47 Why on earth, when the world is awash in cheap oil? Just cause they can?

4624 2018-01-04 18:04:16 Thinking of crowd sourcing a new oil drilling and exploration company whose business model is exclusively drill for oil as near as possible to @realDonaldTrump‘s properties, especially Mar-a-lago & other golf properties.

4629 2018-01-04 18:03:56 I do not see how any oil company is going to do offshore drilling near states that do not want them too.  For example California will Tax the hell out of any oil company and would make it extremely difficult to do.
4630 2018-01-04 18:03:55 Simmer down, snowflake.   The less we have to depend on foreign oil the better.
4631 2018-01-04 18:03:55 2/3 House transpo chairman Jim Howard tried under Jimmy Carter to get transit funded out of other energy taxes (1977-1978) or oil windfall profits tax (1980) to no avail. Finally got transit funded from gas tax in 1982 because highway guys needed urban votes to raise the tax.

4635 2018-01-04 18:03:39 Yes, marijuana laws need to be unified across states (you can possess med oil in GA, but not grow or ship it to you - dafuq?) Jeff Sessions should stay out of States Rights issues. Let Congress or SCOTUS (? can they) make federal decisions on states' legality of pot.
4636 2018-01-04 18:03:29 Lady Press Secretary. You are suppose to explain ALL policies that this President has as his agenada. And, NOT once was a mention about an Arctic oil drilling plan or in fact mention of this project. @SenateGOP @HouseGOP . This was sneaked in. And, that is ground rule for repeal
4637 2018-01-04 18:03:28 Or...we could send @Kyle_Kennedy10 for some oil dry at Advance Auto.

In other words, Trump declared war on California.

Would like to try it in the oil form.
4652 2018-01-04 18:02:09 This was an issue that was highly undercovered by many of the major press outlets despite many studies showing that oil reserves in ANWAR would not have any impact on global oil prices due to the low content in that area.  It was IMO a gross oversight that just slid by the public
4653 2018-01-04 18:02:05 Every gallon of oil we obtain domestically makes our nation safer & less reliant on foreign oil. I for 1 am tired of our soldeirs dying to protect Arab oil states. OPEC has a stranglehold on us. Its dangerous for our domestic security.

4664 2018-01-04 18:01:18 You sent a pic as an answer your projections for oil usage and prices have never been accurate. Saskatchewan and Alberta went into debt based on oil futures to many times already.
4665 2018-01-04 18:01:17 the main question for me, where this oil undersupplied to US. similar magnitude falling of production wasn't observed, as well as growth in internal consumption. Partially oil export migrated to export of oil products. Where the rest? In their own stocks?

4679 2018-01-04 18:00:30 As storm pushes Boston's high tide to record mark, Trump opens the Atlantic coast to oil drilling.  Lather, rinse, repeat.
4680 2018-01-04 18:00:28 lmao Trump admin hates CA so much 
1. Trump hasn't come to CA (small mercies)
2. Move to end State's right to legalise marijuana after CA goes legal
3. Drilling in the Pacific despite history of oil spills near our coasts
4. More ICE agents to come after becoming sanctuary state
4681 2018-01-04 18:00:27 Juniors first then The Oil , then if that’s over , then CNN see what Trump is up to lol
4682 2018-01-04 18:00:26 This is not a distraction. The new tax & jobs bill signed in December featured a key reversal on protection policies on oil drilling in ANWAR as a fundamental portion of the bill. @POTUS himself stated he didn't want to make a big deal out of this to decrease opposition to change
4683 2018-01-04 18:00:26 It's definitely better to become outraged when Middle Eastern countries raise the price of oil, and use the profits against our interests, than to rely on our own secure sources of oil.  It's also better to go to war in the Middle East to secure our sources of oil.

4733 2018-01-04 17:57:11 Hey whats the harm since no such thing as climate change - need that oil to make america great again. Only fair too since thats what the people of Fla wanted and voted for.
4734 2018-01-04 17:57:02 I suggest we spend our money changing the markets - by supporting companies & products who share our ethic & reducing use of Big Oil, Big Pharma et al. If we really want to change our future - we must direct it from here. #WethePeople are the GDP
4735 2018-01-04 17:57:02 Haha y’all cool with buying oil from countries that kill gays and women can’t drive but preach #equality and all this other bullshit y’all imagine up daily here. It’s ok to kill their camels but not our fish.
4736 2018-01-04 17:56:59 Thank God! Since the bill gives the HIGHEST cuts to the 1%ers and businesses with no end! In addition to allowing drilling for oil in the National Arctic Wildlife Refuge! While OUR cuts will end then INCREASE!

4739 2018-01-04 17:56:43 Yeah. I'm old enough to remember full-service stations. Filled your tank, cleaned the windshield, checked the oil and tire pressure, and gave you a free map if you wanted one!
4740 2018-01-04 17:56:37 9/11 had nothing to do with President Clinton. It had to do with the United States and it's foreign policy on Palestine and the whole Middle East campaign. Oil's hell of a drug.
4741 2018-01-04 17:56:20 really messed up my car today. turns out if you try to put the wrong oil in a jaguar, it will scratch your paint and ruin your upholstery trying to maul you
4742 2018-01-04 17:56:20 Oooo I like the looks of this. Maybe the Oil can be nice and just keep that consistent 2018 5-0 home losses going?

4744 2018-01-04 17:56:14 Jojoba oil, almond oil, even olive oil will do the trick and won't hurt you. I'm not fond of the smell of coconut, either, but the oil doesn't really smell like it Absorbs in really well.
4745 2018-01-04 17:56:11 $EVEP  from list ....    maybe they make it ... with 60 oil
4746 2018-01-04 17:56:02 Upset that my coconut oil is $14 but at the same time not too upset to not purchase it
4747 2018-01-04 17:55:50 Took a bath with peppermint oil to help me breathe. I can breathe alright now .. but my body is burning and freezing  the struggle at the moment.
4748 2018-01-04 17:55:49 SO MANY QUESTIONS:  WHY IS THE VALLEY NATURAL GAS/OIL FROM ALISO CANYON BEING DIRECTED TO LOS ANGELES?  OUR NATURAL RESOURCES COULD DEFINITELY PUT US ON THE MAP TO LEAVE L.A. AND BE SELF-SUFFICIENT; PLUS A BONUS TO CREATE JOBS & GET OUR HOMELESS.  SMELLS LIKE ROTTEN EGGS! HELLO!
4749 2018-01-04 17:55:49 Mango powder mixed with lemon juice and olive oil maybe?
4750 2018-01-04 17:55:43 .@cnni Russia exports oil, gas & weapons. In mid-2014, 25% of her economy & 50% of her government revenues came from oil/gas.

4755 2018-01-04 17:55:25 I put oil and lotion on to keep my skin smooth, and I exfoliate 2-3 times a week.
4756 2018-01-04 17:55:24 Im always surprised how many Florida barns don't have AC rooms...with how hot our summers get. after every ride though I would condition it. Or saddle balm. Maybe oil it every other day? Im not too keen on leather care.

4763 2018-01-04 17:54:51 Oh good. Huntington Beach will start to reek of oil again and surfers will come home smelling like garage mechanics.
4764 2018-01-04 17:54:41 That is what happens when Jonathanians awards project to their buddies. That project was screwed up since it started about 8 years ago. Who uses 8 years to build an airport terminal when Oil was selling at $140?
4765 2018-01-04 17:54:41 The family will really be heartbroken will they find out their family member died for corporate greed & oil lmaoooo don't wake up stay sleep

4768 2018-01-04 17:54:28 I don't know, I'd have to see the details. Everything's relative, so if it could extract relatively pure hydrocarbons like ethanol in a way which was less CO2-intensive than oil extraction/refining, there would be some environmental benefit.
4769 2018-01-04 17:54:24 y'all: trust me on this one: garlic soup. fry a ton of sliced garlic in olive oil until golden (don't burn it). add some roughly chopped old bread and fry for another min. add enough broth or stock to cover. simmer 20 mins. paprika. enjoy.

4773 2018-01-04 17:54:19 We must not open all U.S. waters to oil drilling.

4779 2018-01-04 17:53:58 More fishing industries put at risk, more animals potentially killed by oil spills but Trump thinks only of the bottom line of his family assets.

4787 2018-01-04 17:53:32 The best you have for an answer is a meme? 
We don't want your oil, we want the many safer non-polluting alternative green energy technologies that are available and advancing at break neck speed.
4788 2018-01-04 17:53:29 Ok I understand that. But they make their money through war and oil. We dont.
4789 2018-01-04 17:53:27 Not sure about allergies specifically, but rosehip oil is generally *amazing* for skin 
4790 2018-01-04 17:53:22 I bet you 20 bucks he will be like "nobody knew that it was so dangerous to drill for oil."
4791 2018-01-04 17:53:17 Dotzour: If oil rises by another $5 or $10/barrel, could benefit Eagle Ford. But if it rises to $75-100/barrel and stays there, then it will begin to have a negative impact to mortgage rates. @SABoardREALTORS #HF18 ^DR
4792 2018-01-04 17:53:16 Snap full of people asking about my air fryer lol. It’s cool af, the food taste the same, you need a lil sprinkle of vegetable oil (or not doesn’t matter), figure out how to determine the temp bc I don’t know how. And it’s currently on sale at Macy’s for $70

4794 2018-01-04 17:52:54 Looking like oil will shoot up to about $100/Barrel, Of Course y'all support it. I watched a video from Iran and Ironically it looked like what y'all call "Antifa" ...Too early to call until more Iranians come together. 15,000 anti protestors w/ 10,000 pro-gov next day? Too Early

4800 2018-01-04 17:52:31 It might stink that they need to go through the FDA, but that's how it is done. Otherwise, we are pretty much back to the days of snake oil salesman. People could get hurt. Children could be overdosed. It could have long-term effects not required to be explained, etc.

4820 2018-01-04 17:50:10 2 new cryptocurrencies are on the way. #OilCoin will probably take place this month, and Venezuela’s Petro could be in use within a matter of days.

4821 2018-01-04 17:49:59 For Christmas I should’ve asked for an oil change ugh
4822 2018-01-04 17:49:53 You can get it online.  Vape oil is relatively cheap.  Good for vaping and external use only though.  Vaping works best but I lost my pen :)

4854 2018-01-04 17:47:09 The whole "Marijuana" is beneficial narrative is due to the "CBD Oil extract" 

Easy fix- but will "eliminate the high" 
Legalize CBT extract and Hemp usage. 

No getting stoned; medical benefits. Hemp industrial use but criminalize THC. 

No getting "stoned". Bummer dudes!
4855 2018-01-04 17:47:07 I’m researching capsule form vs oil now and prices; topical is much cheaper than oral (lol) dosages. I’m generally into just buying supplements and taking them but some of the CBD capsules are upwards of $70 for 30 depending on dosage.

4865 2018-01-04 17:46:23 I don’t either, but I also don’t think he wants to die anymore than anyone else. The sanctions have him a bit rattled, as well now that SK has confiscated the Chinese oil tankers.

4876 2018-01-04 17:44:20 their CBD oil is made from hemp, so no legality issues in New York, and I've had it in my possession for a month and no swat team has come to my house lol.
4877 2018-01-04 17:44:19 MORE TALK MEANS NOTHING  HOPE THE UN,USA INVADES YOUR COUNTRY AGAIN  TAKE ALL UR OIL AND KEEP 1186 4EVER. DISBAND THE GOI AND ARREST ABADI FOR BEING THE FOOL HE IS.
4878 2018-01-04 17:44:11 Well, they're your problems now since you sold us all out for your oil exploration deal. Good luck weaseling out of this one.
4879 2018-01-04 17:44:04 How can our State look ‘North To The Future’ when our Big Oil owned and operated Retrumplicans look back to the past?
4880 2018-01-04 17:44:02 WHAT!! Gosh i hate your school!! I have some torches and oil cans in the back of my car if you ever wanna burn it to the ground 
4881 2018-01-04 17:44:01 Spent $790 at the auto shop yesterday. And that’s with a free oil change  s/o to Scotty for the hookup
4882 2018-01-04 17:43:59 
4883 2018-01-04 17:43:56 Best part is you save time never driving to gas stations, oil changes & dealerships for useless maintenance. More time for family=priceless
4884 2018-01-04 17:43:45 Snow day cleaning binge. Entire kitchen is scrubbed, including polishing the stainless steel with vinegar and olive oil.

I may be having a crisis?
4885 2018-01-04 17:43:43 The palm oil issue aside, look at all that plastic. Each slice will be wrapped in it.  Just buy a piece of cheese and slice it yourself. 
4886 2018-01-04 17:43:40 Legalize CBD oil, used for many health issues. Pain, mental health, seizures. Research, research.

4888 2018-01-04 17:43:38 Done 
4889 2018-01-04 17:43:37 That dude is a snake oil salesman...lots of good people doing great work with ruminants in the Bay Area....Marin Sun Farms and Prather Ranch Meat Company to name a few.
4890 2018-01-04 17:43:32 I will recommend bluebirdbotanicals - I bought CBD oil for the kitty when she got sick, thinking it might be neuro, and it seems to help her even now. I started giving it to the kitten as well, and she's less standoffish. It might be placebo effect, but it is worth a shot.
4891 2018-01-04 17:43:24 American fracking is a threat to Petro-Yuan (Oil for Gold). Fracking needs to go bust, for that crude prices needs to come down (around USD 40) and birth of Petro-Yuan. @JamesGRickards
4892 2018-01-04 17:43:20 oil wells reopened price of oil rising economy will improve

4895 2018-01-04 17:43:08 We’ve seen the devastation that an oil train explosion can cause, and we know that trains derail. That’s why we’re working to stop oil trains in the city of Baltimore to protect our communities from the same disaster. #StopOilTrains
4896 2018-01-04 17:42:54 like motor oil or cooking oil?
4897 2018-01-04 17:42:51 Yes it does. Just like oil, uranium, gold, and cash money.
4898 2018-01-04 17:42:50 I think I did miss that. Been online sparingly. Yeah oil is definitely needed now. But we've got to get to something more sensible. And deepening our reliance on gas is not it either. Seems like where we're headed though at moment. Bad idea.
4899 2018-01-04 17:42:46 We need a Special Counsel to look at the manufacture and country of origin of that Bowl! 

I’ll bet Trump and the Russians are behind it!
4900 2018-01-04 17:42:37 Hahahah! I'm no oil painting but he honestly looks like he's from the hills have eyes. Absolute creature
4901 2018-01-04 17:42:27 yup so until now, my right lower chest basically under my right nipple still stings because fuck that boiling cooking oil

4903 2018-01-04 17:42:18 Ya, but you know those bank guys. They’re in the pockets of Big Oil, and the Koch’s, etc. They’ll try to make Socialism, high taxes and higher debt, always look bad. Just enjoy the season.
4904 2018-01-04 17:42:08 The world has no ethical oil what are you talking about?
Oil pollutes air, food and water nothing ethical about it.
4905 2018-01-04 17:42:01 To plump up lips, apply peppermint oil.
4906 2018-01-04 17:41:54 They are actually $70k same as pickups & caddy’s.With EVs you pay the gas, oil & maintenance up front & term it out in the car payment
4907 2018-01-04 17:41:44 #itsocold  During a coldsnap; close off unused rooms, lay rolled towels beneath doors, put bowls of water near vents, eat spicy soups, make blanket nests for pets, check smoke alarms, oil you nostrils and lips, sleep more....
4908 2018-01-04 17:41:41 Take fish oil and coq10 3 times a day...I can barely get dressed 1 time per day...you lost your fucking mind.
4909 2018-01-04 17:41:21 I always use a few drops lavender essential oil on my beauty blender because it's antibacterial and it smells sooooo good.
4910 2018-01-04 17:41:12 trying grape seed oil on my face today pray 4 me
4911 2018-01-04 17:41:12 That article was written in 2011.  It's out of date.  The oil price has tanked since then.
4912 2018-01-04 17:41:05 Kenny I have a couple of great crock pot recipes. lasagna and stuffed peppers. But here is how you make stew....first flour and lightly brown the meat in the frying pan with a little oil. Place in the crockpot. Add some beef broth and some water (and a little red wine)
4913 2018-01-04 17:41:03 Ingin bau wangi parfum tahan lama?
ini Tips-nya,
sebelum pake Parfum -- 
Oles tubuh dgn baby lotion (bukan baby oil), 
saat masih basah, semprot Parfumnya 
lalu gosok merata di seluruh tubuh.
Selamat menikmati wanginya

4915 2018-01-04 17:40:52 The Brazilian state oil company, Petrobras, has agreed to pay almost $3bn to settle a class action suit in the United States.
4916 2018-01-04 17:40:43 Not really a bad thing! Allows you to build a sizeable position while the stock consolidates. A lot of oil company's are now leaner and their financials and updates in 2018 should be great.
4917 2018-01-04 17:40:41 Unnecessary Regulations? Keeping our air & water clean? Protecting Nursing Home patients from abuse? Protecting consumers from being scammed by financial institutions? Protecting oil rig workers from a repeat of Deepwater Horizon? You think THOSE regs are "Unnecessary?" Pathetic!
4918 2018-01-04 17:40:36 Followed!
4919 2018-01-04 17:40:33 I got choo
4920 2018-01-04 17:40:30 sessions and facts are oil and water
4921 2018-01-04 17:40:23 Yes, ICYMI, we've had quite the discussion here for the past few days about the NE ISO mix. It definitely has some tough problems to solve. However, IMO, burning oil may be a necessary evil in the short term, but it cannot be part of the target solution.

4924 2018-01-04 17:39:57 Lets just talk about the concept a little farther, #algorithms are the new #capitalist, they rule Youtube, Google, Twitter, the oil industry, and of course the trading world ect. Artificial Intelligence is not even a kick, step, or hop away from being in common speech. #AI
4925 2018-01-04 17:39:49 Sounds like the world could use more ethical Canadian oil.
4926 2018-01-04 17:39:49 Looks like CBD oil is needed.
4927 2018-01-04 17:39:47 Used my Christmas money to pay my phone bill and get an oil change so I'd say I'm getting the hang of this adulting thing
4928 2018-01-04 17:39:44 Nice done! Greenpeace may try the same in the neighbour republic too if they are that tough. The neighbour do have some serious intentions for oil & gas exploration and production in the arctic area too. 
4929 2018-01-04 17:39:43 Hi @nspabeauty Your pineapple products look and smell awesome. Do you use palm oil?
4930 2018-01-04 17:39:40 Do you know if coconut oil is one of the ingredients?
4931 2018-01-04 17:39:35 I’ll see if I can find an oil based ink, precise registration is a skill I do not yet possess. Thank you, what good ideas!
4932 2018-01-04 17:39:17 Yeah. He got the Black Oil virus!
4933 2018-01-04 17:39:03 I was wondering where Session's obsession against marijuana came from? Of course, $$$
4934 2018-01-04 17:38:56 Cannabis does not cause cancer. Cannabis oil is actually used to heal and prevent cancer.
4935 2018-01-04 17:38:52 So I’m at the dealership getting my oil change.... I forgot my jacket in my car & I have on the Kylie Jenner long sleeve of her with half of her ass hanging out... getting the weirdest looks ever
4936 2018-01-04 17:38:51 Nakkan toner, oil cleanser, moisturizer dengan chemical exfoliator yang best 
4937 2018-01-04 17:38:49 I need another recipe for this olive oil. Something easy and quick that I can pare down to 1 serving. Any suggestions @sweetblues420 ?
4938 2018-01-04 17:38:43 Nxa - detox see what-what. As for castor oil, eish, I curse those who made me drink it...
4939 2018-01-04 17:38:28 Kai momentum has been positive, what is frustrating when do the oil stocks rise , they are behind where oil is atm

4944 2018-01-04 17:37:21 Dying of heat cause I just slathered my whole body with coconut oil. The things we do for beauty .
4945 2018-01-04 17:37:18 Leasing is good if you need a new looking car for your job (ie real estate)/don't want to deal with maintenance (excluding oil changes). Buying is good for you plan to hold on to your car for years.
4946 2018-01-04 17:37:13 White people really discovered water and coconut oil in 2017. Astounding.
4947 2018-01-04 17:37:07 But Mr. Trump promised American oil boost and world's leading by 2018. Should we think its one of the dangerous paths toUs government shutdown?.
4948 2018-01-04 17:36:40 Coconut oil is the best thing ever
4949 2018-01-04 17:36:25 Oil furnace.. but I'll turn on the fire place app on my TV lol
4950 2018-01-04 17:36:14 I Have Been Putting A lot of Oil In My Hair For This Color #Red Heads Are. Better 
4951 2018-01-04 17:36:14 Bye, banging on heads won't change the fact the world is shifting away from oil either.
4952 2018-01-04 17:36:14 I finally found cruelty-free oil to remove make up, plus a super cheap peeling that smells like my favourite ice cream from when I was a kid 
4953 2018-01-04 17:35:49 @LeBatardShow I’ve slung chips for 9yrs, the most disgusting thing I’ve ever opened was a completely full bag of chips. The oil in the chips saturates the entire bag, thus making it a matter piled up ball of potato
4954 2018-01-04 17:35:46 Never bacon. Sprouts, olive oil, kosher salt. Roasted.
4955 2018-01-04 17:35:40 So many different inputs I got dehydrated, acne prone combi skin. natural treatment are not better but may be actually more irritating, like lavender oil. Stay away from sulfates and denat Alcohol. Aha, bha and retinoids are good my pers fave ingredients is niacinamide
4956 2018-01-04 17:35:32 So it was the design of Saudi Arabia that #shale oil increased nearly 1m b/d Dec16-Dec17? Certainly it was a design that Saudi decided to target US, but the output cuts were forced: either cut, or face low oil prices.
4957 2018-01-04 17:35:31 Thursday’s STV News at Six:

 Scottish farmers call for clarification over post-#Brexit subsidies #stv #stvnews
4958 2018-01-04 17:35:31 For what it’s worth, gas is actually available and has been throughout the cold snap. A number of gas plants aren’t running because the oil units are cheaper. We’re seeing the same dynamic in NY and PJM.
4959 2018-01-04 17:35:21  oil and gas, no pipelines, no investment, no growth or confidence in stocks. Drill a good well now and it might lower stock price.
4960 2018-01-04 17:34:53 Use Purity by Philosophy! It’s oil free, dissolves ALL makeup, eyeliner, mascara, etc. and doesn’t remove eyelash glue! My extensions stay on, girl!
4961 2018-01-04 17:34:32 The one thing I will say is nuclear power. Far safer and far cleaner than oil. Although every sore has its pros and cons.
4962 2018-01-04 17:34:26 Our Charcoal Oil Control Scrub contains alumina, a superfine crystal, and scrubbing beads made of specialised waxes.
4963 2018-01-04 17:34:25 Don’t know if I can do this job anymore. Just got told by the Environmental Agency that I’m basically responsible now for millions of pounds worth of oil spill damage and 3000+people not having water because my supervisor refused to take a call
4964 2018-01-04 17:34:25 Pretty hard to see how NE can afford to lose emissions-free nuclear plants AND back out 25% capacity we are now getting from oil during these cold snaps. Cheap battery storage may *eventually* replace the oil capacity. But not the nuclear units. Tough situation for New England.
4965 2018-01-04 17:34:22 I believe the jobs report is very good putting oil,mine, workers to work, I understand thats back to work great, if I could keep you mining and drilling for 2years? ( None oil, or coal) then open up commercial again safety for you and eco friendly. Go to work think about this.
4966 2018-01-04 17:34:15 jacket potatoes are brilliant. no doubt. do you wrap yours in foil, oven bake, microwave, roast in fire, rub with oil & salt, serve with tuna, cheese etc? what's your jacket?
4967 2018-01-04 17:34:09 Warren Buffett looks out after Warren Buffett
He opposed the pipeline because he has billions invested in tankers carrying oil out of Canada
He didn't make his money worrying about others.

4969 2018-01-04 17:33:49 About to surprise James by fixing all the little things wrong with my car. A new blinker, new taillight bulb, and do an oil change. He might come home to a mess. 
4970 2018-01-04 17:33:46 My fish oil capsules contain peppermint so you don’t get the fishy burps.  

Isn’t modern life so confusing?

4972 2018-01-04 17:33:33 I’ve recently learned about CDB oil. I read it is legal in Ohio. My boyfriend suffers from terrible leg pain. I’ve been thinking about trying this for him.
4973 2018-01-04 17:33:27 Same here!!!
4974 2018-01-04 17:33:00 I make her drill for hours to obtain fresh oil
4975 2018-01-04 17:32:45 Goodbye and good riddance to @KrisKobach1787, corrupt snake oil salesman from KS.
4976 2018-01-04 17:32:43 In my experience, they pump and clean windows. Have checked oil cheerfully when asked.
4977 2018-01-04 17:32:37 So I don’t think I put enough oil in the chocolate fountain #EpicFail
4978 2018-01-04 17:32:37 Bei #Globuli scheiden sich die Geister. #Arzt hat Verschreibungshoheit, Kosten werden von mancher #GKV (z.B. BKK Mobil Oil, TK, Barmer) getragen. #Apotheker müssen beliefen #Kontrahierungszwang
4979 2018-01-04 17:32:36 i told @liciaxox0 that putting windshield wiper fluid in your car is as easy as “dumping it into the hole with the genie bottle on it” DONT DO THAT. THE GENIE BOTTLE HOLE IS THE OIL. dump it into the one that looks like a damn windshield.
4980 2018-01-04 17:32:29 2.  U2, REM and Midnight Oil will always be my favorite bands but right now, I think @_Warpaint and @TheNational are making the best music(and joining the 3 above on my list). I don't think it is wrong to think this way nor a betrayal to the bands I've loved throughout my life.
4981 2018-01-04 17:32:25 LMAO THE TANNING OIL
4982 2018-01-04 17:32:20 Driving #NASCAR car like on the ramp today ORD...ice,oil, de-icing fluid makes for a slick track...
4983 2018-01-04 17:32:17 I am not an expert although I play one on twitter, but in my humble opinion the special teams stink mainly because the Oil hardly ever win face-offs when a man down or a man up because they face the opponents best guys on the dot.
4984 2018-01-04 17:32:05 Ok then, I'm a deranged deplorable! Badge of honor!
4985 2018-01-04 17:32:00 This person thinks he's genetically superior to anyone who doesn't look like his googled oil paintings. Freedom to them means freedom for white people who agree to bang out white babies for the reich. So long as they're not disabled or want to smoke weed.
4986 2018-01-04 17:31:58 Amazing what a day does. Yesterday all but 2 of the oil stocks I watch were still in a stay long position. Today even with oil higher. That stat has now changed only 17 of 35 stocks remain in Stay long position.  Or just 51% compared to 94% yesterday.  Tighten stops if long now
4987 2018-01-04 17:31:52 Same here,and plus I use benzac which makes it even worse.doing coconut oil at night now though,it's looking better
4988 2018-01-04 17:31:46 Capital expenses have done down steadily from 24% of overall budget in 2001 to 14% now. What’s worse, even NAREGA is a part of capital expenditure !! Slight imbalance in oil and subsidies can almost wipe out our capital budget.
4989 2018-01-04 17:31:45 have you tried cdb oil?
4990 2018-01-04 17:31:28 Why did everyone decide to come get their oil changed today
4991 2018-01-04 17:31:25 Regulations save 1000s of job each year. Easier to sell your crops when the water needed 2 grow them doesnt have cancer causing chemicals Easier to sell fish crab & shrimp when they arent killed first from oil Easier to borrow money when every bank in the Country isn't failing
4992 2018-01-04 17:31:02 when I was modelling I ended up with over 200 pairs of swimwear - I now down to 80-100 - one of the perks you model you tend to keep them but baby oil etc trashes them also so lot ended up on the bin afterwards

4996 2018-01-04 17:30:49 my mom just gave me sparkling perfume and sparkling body oil bc she knows me so well
4997 2018-01-04 17:30:45 Your sixth-grader is more pragmatic than most Democrats and school administrators who think putting up a "no guns allowed" sign is anything more than snake oil.
4998 2018-01-04 17:30:43 Go and do some research before spouting off URmouth. I personally think after all our losses since 9/11 all oil rigs in Iraq R ours @least
4999 2018-01-04 17:30:38 Lmao I’m struggling wit my left side but wild growth oil working slowly but surely 
5000 2018-01-04 17:30:35 I need to get a punk ass oil change
5001 2018-01-04 17:30:32 @SenatorCollins @SenAngusKing @chelliepingree @realDonaldTrump where is our oil???? Mainers are losing patience and lines are growing longer. Please help us if you actually care!
5002 2018-01-04 17:30:28 As an Oregonian I’m MAD AS HELL that this slimed it’s way around our electoral process, the same process that’s rejected self-serve so many times. 

Suspect all the BS directed to anti-self serve was started by paid trolls: oil industry PROFITS by making u pump your own.
5003 2018-01-04 17:30:17 Oil money back to us, and mass action against USA .. it is a time question
5004 2018-01-04 17:30:14 Just tried something new..Maple Holistics Tee Tree Oil Conditioner.... I have the worst hair and thought maybe it would help....and it doesn't disappoint.  YAY
5005 2018-01-04 17:30:09 g castor oil grew my hair out so quick like literally weeks 
5006 2018-01-04 17:30:08 OIL DIFF: 6.24 -> 6.3
5007 2018-01-04 17:29:55 Except I used a fork to incorporate the oil until pea sized, then stirred the warm water in, and then kneaded by hand.
5008 2018-01-04 17:29:49 There is no evidence either way, just opinions it needs to be able to be tested. CBD oil helps many, you can buy on amazon, why because Colorado legalized it. Morphine, oxy, fentanyl all legal, but not pot.  Just doesn’t make sense to me.
5009 2018-01-04 17:29:48 Its oil almost lights up even though it has not been touched by the fire. It is light upon light.
5010 2018-01-04 17:29:35 Diets going well, forgot to take my vitamins and fish oil....... washed them down quickly with a beer I just opened 
5011 2018-01-04 17:29:31 What do you use? Goose grease? Vaseline? Used motor oil? How DO you manage to get THAT far up the Donald???
5012 2018-01-04 17:29:29 Market has bigs call to make on financials (today) and on oil (tomorrow), two big drivers of the market lately.
5013 2018-01-04 17:29:21 @CarolineHirons hello dear! Using a retinol such as the P&M oil after a salicylic acid ok or nay? Much love x
5014 2018-01-04 17:29:21 We can see further uptrend on the price of the oil thanks to it #traderxpro
5015 2018-01-04 17:29:16 On the other hand, burning an incredibly high-value resource like oil in a 45% efficient generator to produce electricity is fundamentally insane, and should be avoided, even at a premium cost.
5016 2018-01-04 17:29:07 If you aren't smothering yourself in coconut oil with this weather at least once a day I am judging you and your skin
5017 2018-01-04 17:29:00 It’s people like you who continue to say every decision the franchise makes is a good one and somehow preach your 20 games at a time garbage year after year when the #Isles are forever running on a track covered in the oil they themselves dumped on it, who sound absurd.
5018 2018-01-04 17:28:59 I'm somewhere between the two of these - don't let it go black, but don't stop until it's crispy. Olive oil and cider vinegar is the other dressing that works nicely to crisp it up.

5020 2018-01-04 17:28:28 No secret really of American administration involvement in oil  dating back to Reagan and Bush
5021 2018-01-04 17:28:21 these so-called policies will amount to as much 'snake oil' as anything else. Sugar pill insurance. #Healthcare
5022 2018-01-04 17:28:19 my sister wrote me a check with "Sith belly oil" in the memo line

I just didn't want to be alone with that.
5023 2018-01-04 17:28:16 Franch oil is too sticky
5024 2018-01-04 17:28:16 I got an olive oil voice
5025 2018-01-04 17:28:15 Absolutely!  He is the oil that makes all the other gears run smoothly
5026 2018-01-04 17:28:12 Most world leaders were heavily invested in oil and now they are investing heavily in green energy technologies because the people they represent demand it. Just like what's happening in Canada.
5027 2018-01-04 17:28:08 You cannot get a good job in any oil company in Nigeria without a 1st degree but the Minister of Petroleum in Nigeria does not have a 1st degree. What an irony
5028 2018-01-04 17:28:04 boil, reduce & cover, cook on low til done. drain, allow to cool. meanwhile caramelize an onion or some shallots in oil in a pan. let em burn! they're good that way
5029 2018-01-04 17:28:03 Sometimes I like to dramatically flip my tortilla. Sometimes I also splatter hot oil on myself. WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS?
5030 2018-01-04 17:28:00 Such as bathing appears to you - oil, sweat, dirt, filthy water, all disgusting - so is every part of life and everything.  Marcus Aurelius
5031 2018-01-04 17:27:40 Maybe they will stop wearing patchouli oil too, which is a much worse crime.
5032 2018-01-04 17:27:28 The People say No to Oil Mr. @realDonaldTrump
5033 2018-01-04 17:27:28 I do have an oil for that!  I am going to make you a roller ball and send it to you!
5034 2018-01-04 17:27:26 Bouffon peut-être, mais surtout trouvère ... (troubadour en langue d'oil) ... 
5035 2018-01-04 17:27:18 You fit in nicely with this band of grifters and snake oil salesmen.  looks like the snow has driven you in the house and forced you to take time off your three card monte game & selling fake Rolex's in times square.
5036 2018-01-04 17:27:12 I wish you were the woman in the video & you slipped off the bumpers. 

Or you tried to bowl normally & you slipped on the oil on the lane.
5037 2018-01-04 17:27:11 If you really cared about the troops you'd stop sending them to die for more gold oil and drugs!
5038 2018-01-04 17:27:11 Lol man say oil change and love  huge exaggeration, but the difference really isn't that far off for maintenance with older models. Both, once properly taken care of are very reliable
5039 2018-01-04 17:27:00 why? Are u too worried about not getting oil from Iran? Yes, let people die as long as we get our oil. I don't know if you have kids or family but for once, put urself in an Iranian's father shoes to see how it feels.
5040 2018-01-04 17:26:52 Ask yourself 1 question: Why would an Oiler fan attack Maroon's gf after he hit Doughty? Makes no sense. Kings fan posing as an Oil fan maybe?
5041 2018-01-04 17:26:47 Yezz, I can believe it
5042 2018-01-04 17:26:38 dalam bilik aku ni bau grape seed oil plak

5044 2018-01-04 17:26:25 Realty is the world is divesting from oil and moving to greener pastures. Join it or get over it because it's happening.
5045 2018-01-04 17:26:16 From the Geezer Oil Trader in Houston #OOTT : "The greatest injury to an energy producer isn't losing money; it's leaving money on the table."
5046 2018-01-04 17:26:15 @carrieunderwood There is a Product called "Bio Oil" if you're interested or perhaps already know about. Or you may not need anything. Just thought I'd mention it. 
5047 2018-01-04 17:26:11 So the uprising Obama ignored in 2011-2012 was just the people.  But, in 2018 its the oil?  You need a war hungry Neocon President for your concerns to be accurate.  Meanwhile you are siding with the Mullahs.

5050 2018-01-04 17:25:43 Like watching an oil tanker slowly sinking on the high street. They have no clue and the competition is everywhere.
5051 2018-01-04 17:25:39 fry in dash of oil in another pan.  When coloured a bit on both sides and releasing their oil, chuck into soup pan (once potato is soft). THen fry chopped/shredded kale in the chorizo oil and put that into the soup pan too.  Cook it all together for a bit longer.

5053 2018-01-04 17:25:08 A bill has just been introduced in the California Assembly that would ban all fossil-fuel vehicles in the state by 2040. Cue the "outrage" of the GOP and their Big Oil masters in 3, 2, 1 (even though many of them will be dead by then)....
5054 2018-01-04 17:25:07 What do you think of the future of employment in #Albertas oil and gas industry?

5056 2018-01-04 17:24:50 Because we imbeciles as you call us know there is a better way to get energy than drilling deep holes, pumping millions of gallons of fresh water into them to get oil out of them.
5057 2018-01-04 17:24:46 @JeepCares I was told by the dealer that it is normal for my '15 Renegade to use 1 quart of oil every 1,000 miles.  2.4L engine.  True or False?  Seems like I will need to be adding oil quite often.
5058 2018-01-04 17:24:39 25 years ago the Braer Oil Tanker ran aground in Shetland. Just been reflecting on how it influenced my career and life

5062 2018-01-04 17:24:14 okay but I swear that at least half the terfs I see on here have some damn oil painting from the 1800s as their avatar
5063 2018-01-04 17:24:10 Wait, a win against the oil companies? Yagottabeshittingme.
5064 2018-01-04 17:24:06 Time to change the oil
5065 2018-01-04 17:24:01 My friend sprays it with oil, sprinkle of salt and sugar and pops it in the oven to go crispy, like crispy seaweed. Apparently it is very moreish. I sautee mine with bacon, or use it in bubble and squeak.
5066 2018-01-04 17:23:45 Exactly. So if you want your home country to keep it's soveriegnty, don't screw with us. And hide your oil.
5067 2018-01-04 17:23:38 Caldo verde soup is my favourite way of eating it. Dice 6 medium potatoes, finely chop an onion, fry in olive oil in big pan for a bit. Pour over 1.2l cold water, bring to boil, simmer until potato soft. Meanwhile slice one large or two small chorizo rings into coins then -
5068 2018-01-04 17:23:34 Hovering around $62/barrel, oil could settle at the highest level since December 2014.
5069 2018-01-04 17:23:34 Friend! I'm using V&M's CPC+G oil now for my pigmentation, and it works wonders! P300+ in BeautyMNL. Super low-maintenance too unlike the Klairs!
5070 2018-01-04 17:23:31 Who? I haven't seen a single tweet,Oil country is pretty tight I'm sure we would have seen such tweets. I'm guessing more like kings fans posing.
5071 2018-01-04 17:23:29 2/ Now I take MJ oil. I actually wept when I first tried it & was pain free. Wept. It has been PROVEN that it also works for Autism and PTSD. It’s from the earth, not like all the chems Drs/Big Pharms hand out like candy. He has no idea. Moron #2.

5077 2018-01-04 17:23:02 There is no test because of federal government, no testing, no science, any science pro or against is junk, because it can’t legally be tested, cbd oil completely legal, why? Cuz Colorado legalized it and found a part of pot plant that helps ppl,without high.
5078 2018-01-04 17:22:57 You should do acid exfoliating and a non comedogenic oil. Have you heard of @deciem? Try their lactic acid 5% + ha 2% for exfoliation & the squalane oil for moisturizing.
5079 2018-01-04 17:22:57 It doesn't matter who has oil or who is selling it either. It comes down to there are alternatives and we want them instead of oil.
5080 2018-01-04 17:22:56 I'm really a Health fanatic...like castor oil, cocunot oil, vitamin E oil, Apple Cider Vinegar, vitamins, & WATER is sooo essential to me 
5081 2018-01-04 17:22:56 I hate paying for oil changes.
5082 2018-01-04 17:22:55 Petróleo

5083 2018-01-04 17:22:53 NOO...My daughter is a master lash tech and you absolutely must gently wash your face and lashes. Use a soft lash brush after. You could get a buildup of demodex  folliculitis (mites) 
Just avoid and moisturizer that contains oil and you'll retain your lashes longer.

5087 2018-01-04 17:22:32 You would be more subtle standing in front of him with knee pads and a bottle of baby oil    Have some pride man
5088 2018-01-04 17:22:27 Because Trump didn't think beyond this:

Trump&Co: "You help me become president, get in White House, forgive our Russian held debt. We'll lift sanctions, open up oil reserves, etc..we'll make billions

Putin&Co: OK...
Simple

5089 2018-01-04 17:22:26 Yeah, try licensing that car for less than $850/yr and that's before $1 in gas, oil or repair.
5090 2018-01-04 17:22:20 Oil is once again flowing to the Sidra export terminal after the National Oil Corporation repaired a damaged pipeline, believed to be blown up by terrorists, which will ultimately restore up to 100,000 bpd of overseas crude sales.
5091 2018-01-04 17:22:20 A lot of British soldiers and civilians are going to die if we allow Netanyahu to lead us by the noses into war with Iran, so he can keep the oil in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights region of Syria.
5092 2018-01-04 17:22:13 Body oil or coconut oil are good for sensitive skin. I have sensitive skin though and I just use ponds from Walmart a lot of times and it works well.
5093 2018-01-04 17:22:06 If oil goes up then Bad for stocks...
5094 2018-01-04 17:22:05 Oil sector workers in the south of Iran joined the nationwide strike this afternoon.
In 1979, the strikes in oil sector were one of the main factors which speeded up the fall of Shah regime.
5095 2018-01-04 17:22:02 Honestly the country was screwed either way. The North damn sure didn’t care about the South, they only cared about the oil.

5097 2018-01-04 17:21:58 Sometimes I forget that people are not accustomed to the smell of the oils I use for my hair . 
I'm so used to them that I'm not bothered anymore. My dad dies every time he smells amla oil 
5098 2018-01-04 17:21:56 "Free oil change, satisfaction guaranteed" 

I can see the confusion that may be had.
5099 2018-01-04 17:21:40 the cool thing about essential oil people is how easy the snake oil jokes come
5100 2018-01-04 17:21:40 And the olive oil you can buy in these places has such a strong and unique taste!
5101 2018-01-04 17:21:29 I've been wondering this forever!! So if you order directly from the La Mer website you can order travel sizes for much cheaper and they give you 2 samples and right now they have a free oil with purchase. I think I'm going to take the plunge and try it!
5102 2018-01-04 17:21:27 How much do oil changes usually cost? Cuz i kinda wanna buy a wig 
5103 2018-01-04 17:21:21 This lady just called and asked if she can take her car somewhere else to get the oil changed. Bitch idc. You can take it to my house if you want. I got you for $200 
5104 2018-01-04 17:21:15 And THAT is what they're made up of pal. Unheard of worldwide till 8 years ago, claim to be "Manchester's Club" yet can't fill their own stadium. Relevant purely because of Arab Oil, embarrassing really. Was he following them away at Rochdale too I wonder??? ;)

5110 2018-01-04 17:20:45 I hate getting an oil change bc I’ve heard so many stories of them fucking up your car so you can come back and waste more money lol
5111 2018-01-04 17:20:44 Saudi, Israeli, and Turkish Companies that were selling ISIS oil had ties to Al-Qaeda, they are one in the same?!?... IMHO

5115 2018-01-04 17:20:22 Kurdish gangs now very angry you can notice it in comments even cuz they hated that Iraq stopped them to steal oil, or fighting against Iraqi army n pushing Iraq into civil war. Thank you for supporting unified Iraq.

5117 2018-01-04 17:20:10 NAT potential for Island reversal, FTK just looks like sort of pattern I like, though usually I use quarterly charts. I suspect both buoyed by oil rising. Small positions as they are speculative by my standards
5118 2018-01-04 17:19:53 @tvcnewsng    @EstherTVCnews @ngozialaegbuTVC  Fuel Scarcity should be resolved in 3 ways use road,rail and water to distribute oil to all the 36 States
5119 2018-01-04 17:19:44 A rare split between @FLGovScott & his pal @realDonaldTrump: "It is likely that the Department of the Interior will consider Florida as a potential state for offshore oil drilling – which is something I oppose," Scott says in a statement today.

5121 2018-01-04 17:19:31 Yes because not having an oil pipeline through a wildlife preserve was such an unnecessary regulation.
5122 2018-01-04 17:19:18 WHY THE FUCK IS AN OIL CHANGE $75!!!!

5126 2018-01-04 17:18:55 I should really learn how to change my oil  tired of paying for this shit.
5127 2018-01-04 17:18:54 2018 can y’all black ppl stop saving oil you never use y’all black ppl love saving oil just for the simple fact you don’t feel like throwing it away now it is time to let it go

5131 2018-01-04 17:18:21 HahahahahaI'm on the ground
5132 2018-01-04 17:18:16 Again believe what you want to. I will like many will cast my vote with Paris Accord before supporting oil.
5133 2018-01-04 17:18:12 Again, somehow you went from a conversation about drilling for oil to the Tea Party and the Freedom Caucus. I am not sure how you made that turn, but either way you are incorrect
5134 2018-01-04 17:18:04 Very Correct! Lake fish eat succulent warms hence greatest quality of omega oil unlike pond fish that eat chicken droppings and feeds. "You are what you eat"

5136 2018-01-04 17:17:55 If you honk at me .003 seconds after the light turns green I will put that bitch in park, adjust my seat, check my tire pressure, change my oil and return a few emails. Don’t try me.
5137 2018-01-04 17:17:50 Injustice to one is injustice to all am insupport of the Ogboni people not to allow any further oil drilling in their land until their problems is solve or attended.
5138 2018-01-04 17:17:48 In Georgia they have a button you can push if you're disabled and someone will come pump gas for you. As far as checking your oil and wiping off the windshield I think not.

5141 2018-01-04 17:17:36 Pro tip for all my naturals: If your hair is dry don’t put oil in it. Oil is a sealant and will SEAL  in whatever state your hair is in so try water or a water based moisturizer.

5143 2018-01-04 17:17:11 These ritz hand snacks with the cheese is oil rn 
5144 2018-01-04 17:17:06 I can’t talk ish. I need a oil change in 100 miles and I know I ain’t gonna take it in by then. 
5145 2018-01-04 17:17:03 Indeed. So why are so many imbeciles opposing Canadian oil? Energy East, Northern Gateway, etc would have diminished ME exports a little, yes?
5146 2018-01-04 17:16:58 Mines Lil Oil Change 
5147 2018-01-04 17:16:55 Honestly, halibut isn't my fave, so I gave it away.  But when it's fresh, olive oil, salt and pepper is all you need.
5148 2018-01-04 17:16:47 I just had my oil change and the fuckers told my I don’t need tires for another year  but I’m seriously about to spin out lol
5149 2018-01-04 17:16:43 Also, you also have to babysit it so the carrier oil doesn't burn because once you burn the oil you have to do it all over again

5153 2018-01-04 17:16:20 Story time (thread): Last weekend I rode with an Uber driver and we talked about the impending marijuana legalization in California. She confided in me that the reason she moved to California was so that her epileptic daughter could be treated with CBD oil.

5155 2018-01-04 17:16:14 Stop selling snake oil. Black people don’t care to know about your fake god. This is the garbage you’ve been using to keep black people from their true calling. Black people you’re the chosen ones stop taking directions from people trying to control you!!!
5156 2018-01-04 17:16:10 This is ALL on you Gov Scott. As well as any future disastrous oil spills that might happen due to YOUR party eliminating laws to prevent them. Your state is on a republican path to ruin. You are quite the steward.

5171 2018-01-04 17:15:03 You know, ladies, a little gratitude would be nice. Men spend their entire lives building things, largely just to make YOUR lives easier. Who ran that power line? Who drilled that oil well? Who built the room currently protecting you from the cold?

I've tried using so many different cleansers, moisturizers, oils etc to get rid of my acne and nothing works! do you use this jojoba oil as a moisturizer, like applying it after you cleanse your skin?? just wondering as I've searched high and low for good acne products!

5181 2018-01-04 17:13:58 Uh it's a lil more intricate because you cook it differently with a carrier oil but you have to cook it long enough until the pom infuses in the oil and that depends on how ripe the pomegranates are
5182 2018-01-04 17:13:54 I don’t even have room to put spare olive oil or paper towels in my studio apartment, let alone a kit as thorough as yours, but I’ve thought about packing a ready to go backpack. Thanks for the list!

5184 2018-01-04 17:13:41 Lol, same ol story, Nigerian elites don't want us to thrive, see the video of how much he spent preparing that land before building on it, he will become our sole milker and the economy may depend on him, as a business man I expect him to hold us ransom like oil marketers do.
5185 2018-01-04 17:13:41 I remember. We didn't close schools. At home we kept the woodstove going & oil just enough to keep pipes from freezing. The difference is it all came w/plenty of time to prep. Although, we knew this was coming, too. The beauty of growing up poor is you learn resiliency.  
5186 2018-01-04 17:13:37 If you made money in this run up, good for ya and you should continue doing that if that's what you feel:)

5205 2018-01-04 17:10:50 Today I rubbed thc cbd and copaiba (hemp) oil on my mf back. I'm so done with my bitch ass drugs.
5206 2018-01-04 17:10:44 Even after proving it is helping adults and children?  I know for a fact it helps pain.  I know I have never seen a kid "high" after using the cbd oil.  I know that it helps PTSD patients deal with some of problems that protecting OUR ASS created!!
5207 2018-01-04 17:10:37 Because it's a job I could easily do myself. Like if I need my oil changed, I can do it myself OR take it to a shop. If I need my house cleaned I can do it myself OR hire a cleaner. But it is illegal to pump gas yourself. It's the requirement to use the customer service...

5222 2018-01-04 17:08:56 Agreed.  It's why i began writing about USD shortages in late Sep-14 due to USD being dumped in oil trade leading to bullish USD action, & turned USD negative late last year post-Trump election as price action & fundamentals began hinting at coming USD deval.
5223 2018-01-04 17:08:47 Dramatically Kim open the gate which connects to south Korea
It's good for Kim/NK to engage in a dialouge with moon/SK &sort out the difference good for NK&SK
#Trumps diplomacy with world leaders to check Kim yeilded good results
#UN sanctions make Kim saft(he is not getting oil)
5224 2018-01-04 17:08:47 Trump is the end result of capitalism...  We probably deserve him/it because of our disregard for the environment, the poor, the sick and for waging war for oil around the world.   I just hope we come out of this mess a stronger, more compassionate, more enlightened nation.
5225 2018-01-04 17:08:44 i heard a funny story recently where someone got scrambled eggs to go at an italian establishment and the guy was like, ohhhh it needsa some olive oil *dumps mad olive oil on the eggs* MAMA MIA

5227 2018-01-04 17:08:32 And then they would control nearly  the entire world’s oil supply. Do you know who gets to set the price then? It’s a shame the GOP hates renewable & green energy but hey, the Koch Bros have money to make eh.

5237 2018-01-04 17:07:13 There are plenty of antagonists out there who are ready to cry “snake oil” at the first chance they get. Let’s not give them opportunities.
5238 2018-01-04 17:07:12 That was my initial thought as well, although it's not exactly like banning whale oil. UK and France are banning ICE by 2040, Hawaii by 2045, and China at some point in the future (likely after 2040). So the California ban would just help accelerate the phase-out.

5240 2018-01-04 17:07:02 Please everyone stop using the right wing propaganda euphemism “climate change.”  The problem is the Earth is getting hotter.  “Global Warming” is accurate.  Don’t let the right wing and oil money put meaningless verbal garbage in our mouths.#GlobalWarming #BlueTsunami
5241 2018-01-04 17:06:54 My landlord is a complete asshole and didn't refill the oil tank for our furnace like he's supposed to, so our house is freezing because we had to turn the heat down to reserve what's left. No one can shower, do laundry, or run the dishwasher until it gets refilled. 
5242 2018-01-04 17:06:51 So now it's only "top of the globe" warming?
5243 2018-01-04 17:06:36 Hope you didn't eat the whole thing at once as it's just sugar with more added sugar and peppermint oil. That one bar would be 50g of sugar (just over 14 teaspoons).
5244 2018-01-04 17:06:34 Hannity, don't worry about the NFL. That is just a distraction. U & I well know what is going on as did Smedley Butler: "War Is A Racket".

5245 2018-01-04 17:06:30 Oil and gas are mature industries with millions of spin-off jobs, products and services. Renewables are make work projects.

5247 2018-01-04 17:06:18 LOL. You can’t export solar (unless you manufacture panels which we do and they don’t). Saudi Arabia is 90% oil & nat economy. That’s not changing.

5283 2018-01-04 17:01:49 I wash my face just use an oil free cleanser. They are a lot more durable than people think. Goggles haven’t been necessary for mine
5284 2018-01-04 17:01:47 Following you Jeff
5285 2018-01-04 17:01:35 Use vegetable oil in the chain saw and fill the freezer.
5286 2018-01-04 17:01:32 That way you have control of the ratio of protein, carbs, fats too if you want to change it up at all. 

Steel cut oats you can get at any grocery store. MCT oil is prob in a lot of grocery stores too. I’ve used PVL brand but it’s Canadian so prob cheaper options for you in US.
5287 2018-01-04 17:01:32 (though making things more complex, Obama EPA found that bser for methane from new oil & gas sites was same as bser for VOCs -- also covered by standards)
5288 2018-01-04 17:01:31 Oil just pushed through $62 and with no upward income growth will bleed the last bit of spendable income off the middle class that Trump just fucked with the largest transfer of wealth to the 1% in American history.
5289 2018-01-04 17:01:16 I legit get so nervous when I get my oil changed like I swear I just think some final destination stuff is gonna happen
5290 2018-01-04 17:01:15 But I’m going to get my oil changed tomorrow ima let them know. I was just thinking that tho because my mom car was riding smooth AF. Although she does have a 2017 mines 2009
5291 2018-01-04 17:01:06 About to start smelling like baby lotion and coconut oil 
5292 2018-01-04 17:01:04 this is all in China's front yard. They are behind this. And you told us they would help denuclearize them and isolate them, instead they sell them oil . You promised 'Fire & Fury' 'Wiping them out' and 'Utter destruction' and delivered none, & they still fired missiles.
5293 2018-01-04 17:01:01 Where can I find coconut oil for my hair?
5294 2018-01-04 17:00:58 I'm big into oil. I own lots of it and I know what it smells like. It's rich smelling. The smell itself spawns property and mansions.
5295 2018-01-04 17:00:57 id watch the rbob tho.. a ton of room for it to advance vs heating oil with cold weather coming off in the weeks ahead and RBOB looking a little tight in summer.
5296 2018-01-04 17:00:47 Proof for being gouged by oil companies in #Winnipeg, watching @TODAYshow and I see the eastcoast is paying $2.22 for US gallon or $0.59 per liter. Canadian Oil is refined in a Canadian Refinery so we don't need to convert to u.s. dollars. Add $0.22 taxes = 71 cents/litre

5300 2018-01-04 17:00:23 Here's a tip: Check your oil level every other time you fill up. The engine will be warm, and you'll remember to give it regular attention!
5301 2018-01-04 17:00:12 Bought .WTICR 61.93 $WTI #Oil #Olieprijs #Olie #Beleggen
5302 2018-01-04 17:00:10 London's #FTSE closes at new record high of 7,695.88, led by oil shares
5303 2018-01-04 16:59:58 I’d suggest just buying the main ingredients separately and make your own. Buy steel cut oats, good fats(straight MCT oil or coconut oil), protein powder(I like Trutein, but use whatever protein you like), and a shaker cup w/ ball to mix it all.

5307 2018-01-04 16:59:48 In as much as I wanted to smile about this, them I remember that the money you guys use to purchase these are taxes payer money, crude oil money,  revenue. This is not achievements.
5308 2018-01-04 16:59:44 Time for that quick fix from Pacific Seas after this oil change.
5309 2018-01-04 16:59:42 The fruit is really bitter, you can ferment it or jelly it, but it's got a low juice content and large seeds and thick, oily rinds. 
I've seen the rind oil collected and used as a cleaner, like lemon oil
5310 2018-01-04 16:59:39 So what is 'sustainable' without oil and gas and coal? Everything is made from them. What do you think a 'sustainable' economy is? Pls describe.
5311 2018-01-04 16:59:35 Kinda wanna get into oil paints, but every time I think I’m ready I hear Sister Suzy’s fake Ukrainian accent whisper in my ear “slava isusu christu” and a bone chilling shudder runs through my body
5312 2018-01-04 16:59:31 We are all in this together. We all know very well how this all ends. We remember the Stocktwit days :)
5313 2018-01-04 16:59:27 Irrational exuberance for crude oil futures? Maybe not. WTI at $62, Brent near $68. What would oil economists say is price needed to cover "marginal cost" of higher-cost supplies? About WTI $60 I suspect.
5314 2018-01-04 16:59:12 I’ll never have it in my house lol jus coconut oil and he can have a field day with that hell lol

5321 2018-01-04 16:58:13 Only if you stop using palm oil!! Otherwise I am not interested.
5322 2018-01-04 16:58:05 Where the Tea Party come from in the conversation? The conversation was about drilling for oil and somehow you started talking about the Tea Party. Strange
5323 2018-01-04 16:58:01 @survivetheark 

SORRY FOR THE COMPLAINT BUT ARK OFFICIAL IS BECOMING DEAD AT THE MOMENT THE RECNT PATCHES SUCH AS THE AMOUNT OF TIME OUL LASTS AND OTHER UPDATES IM MAKING THE GAME EXTREMLY TEDIOUS AND ALMOST UNPLAYABLE, EVERYDAY ON ARK IM DOING STUFF WHICH I HATE =OIL RUNS WHY !
5324 2018-01-04 16:57:57 Its a well know fact that West was apprehensive of Nationalisation of major oil companies in Iran as a result it organised a CIA and MI6 conspired coup.
5325 2018-01-04 16:57:50 it would probably have been much worse.  The Gulf Stream would have taken a lot of oil north and eastward - and the counter-current would have impacted beaches in the Carolinas.

5327 2018-01-04 16:57:23 Cigarette sucks too, rolled up ones are less damaging, but weed is not as good as everyone wants to make it seem. And usually people who use it as medicine dont actually smoke it but use tha cannabis in stuff as oil and that.
5328 2018-01-04 16:57:21 Hey, I like to shit on the Oilers as much of the next guy, but why would Oil fans threaten Maroon/gf/family b/c he hit Doughty? Maybe a King fan posing as an Oil fan perhaps? Makes no sense.

5330 2018-01-04 16:57:04 I elaborate in my book, but long story short, I ran into a high school friend who didn’t like the taste of vegan-meat. I asked how she prepares it and sure enough, absolutely no oil or seasoning. Not every vegan product is pre-seasoned. Cook it as you would anything else. Season!
5331 2018-01-04 16:57:03 Hey, just because I can't come up with examples... [He trails off as Ves gets up, eyebrows furrowing and head tilting back to meet eyes.] ... Everyone is the oil to my water, jackass. Where are you going?
5332 2018-01-04 16:56:40 Vegan friends - are Chip Shop chips safe or do they fry using the same oil as the fish?
5333 2018-01-04 16:56:35 Farming claptrap oil cans is my favorite hobby
5334 2018-01-04 16:56:34 @gregsestero My husband and I just bought The Disaster Artist and I accidentally spilled salad dressing all over it on the way home. Now it smells like olive oil and cilantro and is covered with brown stains. It felt like a scene from the book

5336 2018-01-04 16:56:24 If the country is doing so well under Trump, why are imports from China ($48.2 billion), from the European Union ($39.4 billion), and from Mexico ($28.7 billion) the highest on record? And the average price per barrel of crude oil ($47.26) was the highest since August 2015.
5337 2018-01-04 16:56:19 BTW; the conversation was about drilling for oil not about mining for coal. But, that is also a great inexpensive source of energy as well.
5338 2018-01-04 16:56:03 I'll do it and I don't smoke (tho as a chronic pain patient I'm interested in studies about cannabis oil helping certain conditions)

5351 2018-01-04 16:53:31 What about medicinal cannabis oil?
5352 2018-01-04 16:53:24 Oil needed to double to get headline PCE above 2%. $65 or $70 WTI won’t get you there.
5353 2018-01-04 16:53:06 That might be what I got, I’m not exactly sure. I asked for high-milage oil because that car has 147k miles on it.

5373 2018-01-04 16:50:36 Interior Sec @SecretaryZinke in about an hour will brief reporters on draft 5-year plan for offshore oil and gas leasing; it will go thru a few more stages (maybe narrowing it down) after public comments

5375 2018-01-04 16:50:09 Correct, this is weather; however, the INTENSITY trend is due to climate change. Johnny, you can sail a fricken oil tanker across the arctic sea for christ’s sake.

5379 2018-01-04 16:49:40 I know sir. Idea is to still make it taste good. Also harder to get the texture right without the oil to bind.

5388 2018-01-04 16:48:43 Me either. Bro should be home by now. It was promised for yesterday, so now oil guy can share in the inconvenience, imho.

5400 2018-01-04 16:47:59 Oh gosh pls no >< though the increase in oil prices will most likely have a snowball effect in almost everything including transportation & food which in turn will impact airfare, hotel & car rental prices :(

Which is ridiculous.when you see the amount of carbon pollution created to build factories which in turn build cars,trucks, planes all of which are polluters too,let’s not forget oil rigs.fuel but you blame cows

5416 2018-01-04 16:46:31 Reduce risk of skidding:
1. Check tyres treads/pressure & brakes often
3. Watch for snow, ice, frost, rain, wet mud/leaves, oil, microclimates, dust/gravel, worn surface
4. Don't drive too fast for circumstances
5. Avoid harsh braking/accelerating
6. Avoid oversteer/understeer

5421 2018-01-04 16:45:46 coconut oil on women is like butter on a biscuit
5422 2018-01-04 16:45:42 Grapefruit Seed Extract (GSE), & oil of oregano. That along with rest, fluids, less (or no) processed sugars, and you'll feel right as rain in no time.  Get well, be well!
5423 2018-01-04 16:45:27 I have to get an oil change yet I’m still in bed

5425 2018-01-04 16:45:13 The deregulation of food/drugs? The abolition of the regs governing airline safety? No harm in that? If you think that then I got some nice bottles of snake oil I will sell you.
5426 2018-01-04 16:45:09 Same  it’s so annoying! But what really helps me is using eucalyptus oil! Better than vapor rub! Lol

5428 2018-01-04 16:44:54 and oil.
5429 2018-01-04 16:44:46 Had we an oil fund in the bank from the revenues stolen from us we might be in a position to offer folk in the Somerset flood plains a free inflatable raft with oars, food rations, a torch, a whistle, and a medical kit.
5430 2018-01-04 16:44:45 Oil may not be fundamentally bullish right now my friend, but your sense of humor the last 2 days is :)
5431 2018-01-04 16:44:38 Sorry, don't buy the Maroon/gf heckling by Oil fans. Case of mistaken allegiances??? Show me proof.
5432 2018-01-04 16:44:26 Who's the faviourate to win the FA CUP/ League Cup/ Champions League and the Premier League this year???.....And clearly your to arrogant and incompetent to know that Manchester United is now being sponsered by Saudi Arabia..The most oil wealty country in the world..keep up
5433 2018-01-04 16:44:26 Please tell me how much oil we took or bought at lower market value due to the invasion of iraq. Its a very simple question. If you want me to believe this conspiracy theory i need to see evidence
5434 2018-01-04 16:44:25 *sean squishing my cheeks*

Me: huh? No..? Oooh.. that’s just my face oil....
Him:

5437 2018-01-04 16:44:16 I second the oil choice question - safflower or canola can have higher smoke points too. It may also just depend on where and what type your fire alarm is. I had one apartment where ours went off every time we opened the oven door.
5438 2018-01-04 16:43:22 Mail-delivery I'm considering 

 The one good thing is that you can get CBD oil, which really is something else
5439 2018-01-04 16:43:21 Besides, a big reason Europe is growing is because of 2016's Brexit vote. Not that the vote itself did anything technical. But that vote caused a massive sell off in the british pound and the Euro. Those weaker currencies means Europe produces more goods rather than importing.
5440 2018-01-04 16:43:20 I'm not even sure where to begin in unpacking it all ... Cars ... People ... Shops .... And the color of my Oil Burner ... Hm, Must be a sign. Must #Meditate
5441 2018-01-04 16:43:16 The world is against further oil exploration and the world will win the little battle.
5442 2018-01-04 16:43:13 I dedicated all yesterday to my car I got her oil changed and her new state inspection sticker and I got her new fender put on 
5443 2018-01-04 16:43:11 Crude #oil prices on reached  their highest level in two and a half years amid tensions in #Iran and with the ongoing support of #OPEC's production cut agreement.
5444 2018-01-04 16:42:59 Does your chart take into effect: time off for raising children (missing time/merit wage increases); high-risk/paying jobs (e.g. construction, oil rigs) that are 90% men; women who seek lower-paying jobs because of the flexibility to support family life. It’s not that simple.
5445 2018-01-04 16:42:57 try a chicken foot and coconut oil
5446 2018-01-04 16:42:53 Yes! Wala pang BF. Virgin na virgin. Parang coconut oil na virgin. Hihi yung isa Amoy patis na. Hahaha
5447 2018-01-04 16:42:49 Coat you w olive oil and explore every hole with every inch of me entire body...
5448 2018-01-04 16:42:46 And use coconut oil for popcorn popping!! Yum!!
5449 2018-01-04 16:42:42 Squared away for attending yet another @SloanSportsConf in February. That came around fast.

Disappointed that I won't be contending for the Hackathon repeat. Can't spread my snake oil too thin.
5450 2018-01-04 16:42:33 Oh geez! I love tea tree oil too!  Didn't know it can strip ur skin like that though! 
5451 2018-01-04 16:42:23 Every time @VP #MikePence claims "#Tehran threatens the world's peace & #security." remember what #Pentagon told Wesley Clark after 9/11 #falseflag "We're going to take out seven (#oil & #gas rich) countries in five years; starting with #Iraq & #Syria & ending with #Iran." #news

5453 2018-01-04 16:42:15 My car is an accurate representation of my life right now: the front is completely crashed, the hood won't come up while it needs oil and power steering fluid, and the inside is trashed, the drivers side window doesn't roll down and my passenger door handle is broken off
5454 2018-01-04 16:42:02 At least that part's easy - only oil I keep in the house!
5455 2018-01-04 16:42:00 Also, keeping a close eye on oil prices, which have risen in recent days on news of continued OPEC cuts and of the current political unrest in the Middle East, particularly Iran. If oil prices rise and the O&G industry starts hiring again, watch out. Market will be sizzling.
5456 2018-01-04 16:41:51 Cut basa. Put salt. Pepper. Olive oil. Throw in bin.

5459 2018-01-04 16:41:37 Can I have a link for the oil please my mum suffers with this xx
5460 2018-01-04 16:41:34 Ingredienzien: Melaleuca alternifolia leaf oil, Limonene und Linalool (bei den letzten beiden ist ein Stern dran, dazu steht, es sei natürlicher Bestandteil im ätherischen Öl.
5461 2018-01-04 16:41:21 Well stocks are bullish. Macroeconomic data should see stocks rise. But oil and commodities are a different story. Good Macro data doesn't mean the data on those rise. I'll defend the rise in stocks, but NOT the rise in oil.
5462 2018-01-04 16:41:20 Coconut oil is above and beyond the medium of choice. Gotta be sure when the light hit the ice it twankle and glissen
5463 2018-01-04 16:41:20 Better with low oil prices when he has nothing to show for very high oil prices in 5years?

No
5464 2018-01-04 16:41:10 It’s all about the saturated fats. Olive oil is your friend.
5465 2018-01-04 16:41:08 Gibby!!!!! Is he holding motor oil or a bottle of hooch? #GibbyTheBest
5466 2018-01-04 16:41:07 sa sobrang dry ng mukha ko ako na mismo naglalagay ng oil shocks swerte ng mga oily nang fes
5467 2018-01-04 16:41:04 My ENT has me do nasal rinses with the Neilmed bottles and mix with two drops of tea tree oil added. Sinus infections are way down. Weird odor, but not as bad as oregano oil.
5468 2018-01-04 16:41:04 Don't let frustration with government/social systems outweigh the science.  Nothing would be worse long term for our economic well-being than the oil & gas/petrochem industry in Houston/Galveston/Texas City area being underwater in 100 years.  Gov't has to be part of the fix.

5471 2018-01-04 16:40:52 Me not liking olive oil cake is an admittance long overdue.
5472 2018-01-04 16:40:48 It is a bit strange that major political instability in a large OPEC member is not seen to impact oil price. Even otherwise great FT (E.C) claimed it could be bearish!?’
5473 2018-01-04 16:40:46 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
5474 2018-01-04 16:40:45 Not to mention one so clearly backed by Westerners. The accounts of workers held in slave like conditions at oil fields operated by British and American companies must have helped.
5475 2018-01-04 16:40:33 Wow so millionaires, billionaires, banks and big corporations have even more money while the rest of STRUGGLE to BUY FOOD, MEDICINE, GAS & HOME HEATING OIL.
5476 2018-01-04 16:40:26 I wasn’t impressed with the long lasting lipstick I purchased. It smelt of oil and didn’t even last long.

5480 2018-01-04 16:39:54 Need to go get my oil changed today
5481 2018-01-04 16:39:22 Hahaha. Same Mueller who backed Bush's lie on WMDS... then laughed about it on national t.v. after my fellow soldiers lost there lives for an oil takeover! Sure we believe him.. What a joke
5482 2018-01-04 16:39:12 I put more oil in it but it still says 5% so wtf did I do wrong
5483 2018-01-04 16:38:57 Unlike the past like when Churchill & Eisenhower plotted to overthrow the government and install their own puppet Shah? Because a nationalized oil industry just wouldn't do.
5484 2018-01-04 16:38:45 While looking at a website for some items import to Pakistan.

One of the main item in Trend feed (search inquiry from Pakistan) was

"Waste Vegetable Oil/UCO/Used Cooking Oil for Biodiesel"

so any one know where are we using biodiesel ?
5485 2018-01-04 16:38:36 I've got a bunch of used motor oil lying around... 
5486 2018-01-04 16:38:27 Look who's talking  Spurs have more trophies than your oil money club L
5487 2018-01-04 16:38:19 Skazzi, the Yuan-ti oil peddler, they have a hard time as people assume it's just snake oil... (Glamour bard)
5488 2018-01-04 16:38:15 Greg she is a very smart engineer from the oil fields. She is a fixer and I would be all for her being our next Govenor !!!
5489 2018-01-04 16:37:54 You need a good night time moisturizer / argan oil
5490 2018-01-04 16:37:50 Correct! I’m in fact sitting in an extremely gentrified Indian restaurant. The water is served in an olive oil bottle
5491 2018-01-04 16:37:49 So they are funded by oil companies? Private or state controlled? Source?
5492 2018-01-04 16:37:48 He never lets the LEFT  hand see what the RIGHT hand is doing, feel me
5493 2018-01-04 16:37:47 Ever! And again - I really like dicks! And like looking at them! If you just ask, I’ll prolly be like, “Make sure you use some coconut oil instead, next time. Get that healthy gleam.”
5494 2018-01-04 16:37:46 I do feel for you. We’re used to it in Montana; our entire population is only slightly more than 1 million, only farms use fuel oil, & 4x4 vehicles are common. Warm thoughts for the Northeast.
5495 2018-01-04 16:37:45 う～む、熱っぽい

5499 2018-01-04 16:37:13 I’ve found that coconut oil gets rid of the itchy! It doesn’t feel immediately moisturizing when you first put it on but check again after like 2 hours and boom. Soft and not itchy.
5500 2018-01-04 16:37:12 まじてんらいぶ楽しみだなあ！

We are talking about a player who wants to go , our team has never been as strong.Rome wasn’t built in a day.

5505 2018-01-04 16:36:49 ELDERS! WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME U PRAYED 4 THE SICK & ANOINTED THEM W/ OIL IN THE NAME OF THE LORD?! OR DO U NOT BELIEVE THE WORD OF GOD?!

5507 2018-01-04 16:36:41 Try coconut oil if your face is dry
5508 2018-01-04 16:36:33 Yes, I think they look great, and doubly so when you compare them to the oil or gas facilities we'd need otherwise.
5509 2018-01-04 16:36:08 Sick of corrupt politics on all sides. POLITICIANS need to be kicked out of office with their first lie! Clinton+Monica=out!
Bush + oil deals=out 
Obama+keep your doctor=out
Trump+ATA=OUT!!
OH THATS RIGHT THERE WOULD BE NO POLITICIANS!! SAD!
5510 2018-01-04 16:36:04 The essential oil diffuser we got for Xmas is doing a number on the chi levels in my house
5511 2018-01-04 16:36:03 Yeah, I get synthetic. It costs more, but I can get by for about 6 months, sometimes longer, between oil changes.
5512 2018-01-04 16:36:03 It's a ridiculous idea to propose LatAm nations would "invade" Venezuela. Only those who wish to take over its oil fields would think that is plausible. The only way to impose real change is through transparent, democratic elections and the fight for that must continue.
5513 2018-01-04 16:35:51 I see.. So refinery margin are with respect to heating oil only? Just to clarify...
5514 2018-01-04 16:35:51 Expect bad days and bad economy with rising crude oil prices. It has already jumped to $68 a barrel and India has to sell Diesel at ₹ 62 a liter. Wait for it to rise above ₹70 by Feb end. I shiver.
5515 2018-01-04 16:35:48 ah, a merchant: oil here get your own camera
5516 2018-01-04 16:35:48 I openly oppose the SJWs who get funding from US funds (Tides and others) to interfere with Canada’s oil and gas industry, to the benefit of the US.
5517 2018-01-04 16:35:41 see your trades. good
5518 2018-01-04 16:35:41 My car plays me by requiring full synthetic oil
5519 2018-01-04 16:35:29 
5520 2018-01-04 16:34:51 When we first started using coal, gas and oil, there was no climate change. But we now have this problem and scientists agree that this is threatening life on earth.
5521 2018-01-04 16:34:33 That's was quick Trump, but let's get onto new energy inventions so we can get energy practically free and get the Bushes out of oil/our lives.
5522 2018-01-04 16:34:31 Just so I understand, it's OK to roll back Obama legislation on drilling oil on protected land, and scuttling Obama's clean air act.  Now AG wants to suck up to tRUMP by making pot illegal AGAIN?  Hugh step backwards in progress, but again all to wash away Obama legacy.
5523 2018-01-04 16:34:27 We have a President who is crazy enough to claim credit for the stock market DJIA increase...which will only last until his first international crisis involving oil or nuclear weapons
5524 2018-01-04 16:34:22 Let's see. Exports may prevent that. But again, the exports are just the U.S. taking OPEC market share. I think the buying right now is just Macroeconomic speculation. Macro numbers look good. But it's clearly not translating into oil data.
5525 2018-01-04 16:34:19 I saw the outrage on FB. The rest of the country, and world has been doing this for a while, and if it’s not cold or raining I don’t mind. I do miss the guy checking my oil and tire pressure, though

5532 2018-01-04 16:33:59 I’m off morphine & oxy with #MedicalCannabis - “lucky” enough to qualify for a med card. $300/year plus taxed on pot. To cover pain from 6 surgeries in 7 yrs I use a lot of oil, salve, vapor, plant. Not covered by insurance. Down 4 scripts so far. No dr can write a $20 script tho
5533 2018-01-04 16:33:53 There’s hardly any help or advice for us so I know how daunting and scary it can bebut there’s definitely hope with the oil if you don’t find it helps straight away then up your dose to a few more drops xx
5534 2018-01-04 16:33:44 America will never engage with NO knowing he's having unclear arms attacked Iraq only after knowing he's got nothing beside oil
5535 2018-01-04 16:33:43 Oil cartridges pens are so clutch when you are on the go.
5536 2018-01-04 16:33:30 That hasn't happened since the 70s and two oil shocks took care of that. This idea of education as a cure-all needs to stop. Consistent work experience is just as important and the barriers to those are what we should be looking at.

5542 2018-01-04 16:33:14 Standing up to him on what? His redline in Syria? Arming Ukraine? Putin effectively evading sanctions through the Russian dominance of the EU energy market especially in oil & LNG? Our EU "allies" not willing to pay for US fuel to counter the Russian threat they claim to oppose?
5543 2018-01-04 16:33:14 Enough TMZ DC. Here is the news:

The US will become a net exporter of oil this year for the first time since 1954.

The US will unseat Saudi Arabia as the largest oil producer this year. 

The US will unseat Russia as the largest producer of nat gas this year.

5550 2018-01-04 16:32:47 I agree, but to me it seemed that even then he was more reserved about it. Now he’s more open. Like the “don’t let us down” comment about an oil rig fanfic. Idk, just a theory.

5557 2018-01-04 16:32:03 I think with the continued gas build ups refineries will draw less oil. Especially at WTI at these prices
5558 2018-01-04 16:32:02 We all drive cars:

The US will become a net exporter of oil this year for the first time since 1954.

The US will unseat Saudi Arabia as the largest oil producer this year. 

The US will unseat Russia as the largest producer of nat gas this year.

5562 2018-01-04 16:31:53 The Venezuelan military has been allowed to buy it for pennies a gallon and then export it anywhere to another country for big profits.  And not a cent reinvested into their oil industry.

5565 2018-01-04 16:31:34 @DSmithShow went to O'Reilys today.  Pulled up and watched one of the customer service advisors go out and check oil for a customer who was not sure what to do.  That is customer service.

5570 2018-01-04 16:31:08 Long gone are the days when they came to you pumped your gas, washed the windows checked your oil etc under the hood and checked tire pressure.   Been pumping my own for years.   Only time I mind it is when its bitter cold like recently.
5571 2018-01-04 16:31:06 Never had an effect on me, I bought some expensive oil for my dog’s arthritis which has minimal if any results. It has only made people annoying and/or chew a homeless man’s face off.

5574 2018-01-04 16:30:38 At last check road conditions between North Shore Road, Flatts & St. George's had improved after a reported oil spill earlier this morning.
5575 2018-01-04 16:30:37 U.S. refineries operated at 96.7% of available capacity last week, their highest use rate in 12.5 years. They processed 17.6 mn bpd of crude oil input, second largest on record.

5577 2018-01-04 16:30:10 You obviously typed your tweet on an electronic device. It is made primarily of plastic. 50% of the oil pumped out of the ground goes to make plastics. Plastics make food safer and save millions of lives in hospitals everyday. BTW; oil is not in veins, that's precious metals

5584 2018-01-04 16:29:23 After the third Punic War, the olive trees occupied a large strip of the Baetica Valley and extended to the center and the Mediterranean coasts of the Iberian Peninsula, including Portugal.
There is plenty archaeological evidence, Roman flotsam full of amphoras with olive oil.

You used to be able to pull up to full serve pumps & they would fill your tank, check tire pressure, oil while you stayed in the car, used the restroom, got directions. Of course, you paid more per gallon for the convenience.

2018 Me: $75 for an oil change (actual price out the door) is only 1.5x the price of a tank of gas. Why would I want to crawl under the car & do it myself?
5615 2018-01-04 16:26:16 Was Gibby carrying bbq sauce, motor oil or whiskey?

5692 2018-01-04 16:17:26 that will never happen its like water and oil...its like ANC and EFF
5693 2018-01-04 16:17:24 Wait until the oil companies start raping your home state because the Federal government says Alaska cannot impose environmental restrictions. Or is that what you want because you loaded up on oil company stock?
5694 2018-01-04 16:17:18 He definitely hasn't got a petrol station. He hasn't got any oil.
5695 2018-01-04 16:17:17 YES! I have cajun spice, jerk spice, paprika, oilive oil, salt, pepper, basil, pesto. THOSE ARE MY WEAPONS PLEASE TELL ME WHICH ONE TO USE I KNOW NOTHING
5696 2018-01-04 16:17:03 All  on $ACB and $WEED. They turn, we all turn. I remember when those two names were 1 of 5 oil companies #future
5697 2018-01-04 16:17:00 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
5698 2018-01-04 16:16:36 Don't forget, Peter, that another Scottish referendum would be very different - can't pretend an independent Scotland wouldn't have to join the Euro, couldn't pretend that fluctuations in oil prices wouldn't bring ruin - basically, no more pretending!
5699 2018-01-04 16:16:27 Some of you people will still use anointing oil to fry dodo and egg for someone to marry.
5700 2018-01-04 16:16:14 Slathering my face in coconut oil because it's so dry my skin is shriveling, and I may have ~25% white hair but I'll be DAMNED if I'm gonna have wrinkles - this was the plus side to my greasy Italian skin and a lifetime of zits!
5701 2018-01-04 16:16:13 And corporations that create crises should be fined big time! You don't get to cause the Opioid crisis or cancer, oil spills, nuclear meltdowns... ,walk away with billions & leave it to the tax payers to clean up the mess. We need regs & a real gov't. #RepubsAreOrganizedCrime
5702 2018-01-04 16:16:09 @TitleSussex Hi, I'd like to send you press releases and info about 1) oil exploration in Sussex and 2) a Sussex restaurant for which I work. Could I have your email address?
5703 2018-01-04 16:16:07 My dad taught me how to change my own oil and tires if need be, but you think I’m doing that if there’s a man around that’s a capable? Yeah alright
5704 2018-01-04 16:15:57 I'm dying to actually get some decent oil paints and actually follow along with him some day (even though I'm 100% sure my painting wouldn't look a thing like his!)

5706 2018-01-04 16:15:49 Where is their oil money? Spend oil money on your own people and not jihad.
5707 2018-01-04 16:15:44 At night use purity face wash & micro delivery exfoliant. Then tea tree oil on your acne spots. Mario badescu cucumber and aloe water. Then either the caudalie moisturizing sorbet and vinoperfect serum or renewed hope in a jar. Wake up and wash your face with just the purity.
5708 2018-01-04 16:15:39 #ThursdayThoughts The oil companies can charge more based on supply and demand, protecting their profit level. So why do they get a subsidy from the government but the rest of us who have no provision to raise more money to pay for oil don't? Just asking.
5709 2018-01-04 16:15:39 Hahaha im born and brought up in TN.HC project is there all over India where ever ONGC feels it can dig and get oil. HC project can be opposed. Even I dont support it in TN specially in the areas that hv been under agriculture for 1000s of years.1/..
5710 2018-01-04 16:15:37 The body has this in built! You just need to oil & service yours!
5711 2018-01-04 16:15:32 I don’t think this report will start the downturn. Need some cruise builds or a smaller drawer.
5712 2018-01-04 16:15:28 Big Pharma is about as lucrative as Big Oil, so they have a considerable budget for lobbyist funds. I would bet dollars to doughnuts you're right and he's get a sizable kickback.
They all need to put their stigma aside and realize the pros heavily outweigh the cons.
5713 2018-01-04 16:15:26 Look at me being an adult and getting my tires checked and my oil changed all in one day
5714 2018-01-04 16:15:21 They’re so flippin desperate!  THEY’RE the ones that need the shrinks. It’s been quite entertaining watching them disintegrate right before our eyes.A little embarrassing too knowing the whole world is watching and seeing our crazies on display.

5716 2018-01-04 16:15:11 I've been applying tea tree oil to an infected or absessed tooth since yesterday. There's a shady dentist in a seedy srtip mall who'll pull it for $250. My neighbors are going to Tijuana for dental implants. 
Third world bullshit in the richest country. Good luck.

5724 2018-01-04 16:14:24 Every dollar we spend on oil changes is a dollar we can’t invest in rebuilding a broken engine.
5725 2018-01-04 16:14:18 Been using castor oil on my hair and I can't tell you how much new baby hairs I have now
5726 2018-01-04 16:13:50 You are generally correct, but that’s not the real issue. It’s a question of value, it makes no difference if insurance pays for oil changes if major repairs are over priced & are purchased without regard to value.

5733 2018-01-04 16:12:52 That warm periods in the past happened because of other reasons is not an argument against human caused global warming now when there is a clear difference that explains it: burning of oil and coal in industry etc 
5734 2018-01-04 16:12:31 A lot of districts in Oklahoma are on a 4 day week right now because they can't afford the extra day of school.  Meanwhile, the legislature refuses to increase the taxes on Oil & Gas production which would fill in the state budget gap.
5735 2018-01-04 16:12:29 Quantify! Numeracy! 

Should we put our heads together, pull in an app person or two, and create a carbon tracker app that makes this as easy as possible for the public?

I'd suggest 4 add'l categories: stuff, food, heating oil, and waste.

5744 2018-01-04 16:11:42 Give me all your possessions. They all took oil to make. Go live in a cave and show us how serious you are about fighting climate change. Everything they say about renewable energy is a farce.
5745 2018-01-04 16:11:36 Soon soon lol ion have enough oil and pomegranate to be making a large batch 
5746 2018-01-04 16:11:34 I came to the dealership for an oil change & the guy at services misunderstood me & has been calling me ms. Rios since I got here. & me being the shy db I am, I never corrected him smh

5749 2018-01-04 16:11:23 My mom would go to the full service gas station when I was a kid. They’d pump your gas, check your oil, wash your windows and run your card. Seems surreal now.

5754 2018-01-04 16:10:37 Sometimes I sautee them and then turn the heat way up and add a smidge of oil when they're done to burn them a tiny bit to simulate the roasted char.

5757 2018-01-04 16:10:26 If you found that most the oil had leaked out of your car so you put more in does that count as a service?

5760 2018-01-04 16:10:11 Deregulation to insure more oligarchs profit is short sighted. Do you intend to keep this up till we the people are forced to eat the rich?  Potable water, clean air to breathe, and sustainable industry is possible. Lose  big oil and go to renewable energy.
5761 2018-01-04 16:10:07 Thursday: Get an oil change for only $9.96

Most makes and models!
5762 2018-01-04 16:10:02 I'm sure there are some who push climate change just bc they don't like industry.  My experience is with atmospheric scientists and oil & gas industry ppl... Climate change believers in those worlds mostly want to help humans, which means balancing CC risks with economic risks.
5763 2018-01-04 16:09:58 #oil #CL didn't budge. Higher US production and gasoline buildup should make it a sell.

5768 2018-01-04 16:09:41 My Pappy just checked the oil in my car, well I’ve been driving around with 1/2 quart of oil. oops

5781 2018-01-04 16:08:45 I'm sure it's just a coincidence, and all the folks who have been denying climate science on the basis of regularly debunked group of cooks funded by big oil money are totally right about all those memes they repost.

5787 2018-01-04 16:08:34 You are mixing two different issues. The 53 Coup was orchestrated by the CIA called operation AJAX, due to the nationalisation of the oil and British accusation of communism.

5960 2018-01-04 15:55:06 #USD – Crude Oil Inventories – in 5 minutes. Expected value: -5.148M
#CrudeOilInventories
5961 2018-01-04 15:54:44 Gas-fired plants can get gas - it’s up a bit (assuming no LNG hedge in place, which many have), but available. Oil is simply cheaper. System and markets working as designed.
5962 2018-01-04 15:54:36 If you have dry,acne prone skin-Argan Pure Oil

If you have dry,itchy or mature skin, Baobab oil is for you.

R180 each
5963 2018-01-04 15:54:30 Iran needs a new Regime !!!! People are getting sick of their own Regime , if they fail to overthrow it , then We (The West) will have to deal with it's regime ........and not for the Oil (wich belong to the Iranian People) but we need to save them as fellow Humans !!!!
5964 2018-01-04 15:54:27 put some peppermint oil on your temples and the area it hurts. or breathe it in slowly. it always works for me when they’re bad
5965 2018-01-04 15:54:26 Precisely why I haven’t gotten extensions. I can put on fakes that are just as convincing. I need my coconut oil remover!
5966 2018-01-04 15:54:26 i agree with having a concentrated oil as medicine. i do not agree with allowing weed to be freely used on the street. its disgusting and a poor example for children. its for losers. and to even suggest that people arent curious about other drugs after feeling high is naive.
5967 2018-01-04 15:54:21 You surely aren't implying only vegans eat palm oil, coconuts & cocoa? lol The vegans I know shop far more ethically than my meat eating friends.
5968 2018-01-04 15:54:16 vegetable oil...λάδι λαχανικών μας λέει ο μεταφραστής... τα ματάκια μας, καλέεε
5969 2018-01-04 15:54:13 @_hollywouldnt @kellydavis226 @reesestar I have: shampoo, conditioner, body wash, toothpaste, face lotion, 2 kinds of regular lotion, hair cream, shaving cream, sunscreen, nail polish, essential oil for headaches, deodorant, comb, and travel toothbrush in the bag.

#Patanjali has raced ahead now it is only chasing game for other MNCs!! Also, MNCs can't change their image overnight, they are at least decade behind now!!
5977 2018-01-04 15:53:21 Since trump was elected, families broken apart, gas prices continuing to hike, oil spills in sacred land that we had an agreement not to touch, brink of nuclear war with Korea and friends, America being Russia’s puppet, scandal, fraud, and impeachable acts almost weekly
5978 2018-01-04 15:53:16 Thanks Mom for the #VitaminE oil

5981 2018-01-04 15:53:01 but like if u trynna buy all new skin care and dont go from one second thinking ur skin is as flaky and dry as a desert to preaching that u've always been a walking oil slick the next are u even trying to have a hot new skincare regime in ur life?
5982 2018-01-04 15:52:57 so I think my new favorite way is to get a pan that's oven safe, saute them with your favorite spices and olive oil and then roast in the oven for ~10 mins
5983 2018-01-04 15:52:46 burnin' d midnyt oil , early morning oil , all the oil i can grasp
5984 2018-01-04 15:52:33 Yes. I take cbs oil and like it. Some days it's still rough though.
5985 2018-01-04 15:52:27 Thanks for your leadership and continued efforts towards sustainable palm oil! Big lesson from our study was that RSPO could protect more forests if more plantations, with more standing forests were certified. Hoping for greater impacts as members follow their timebound plans.
5986 2018-01-04 15:52:24 High alkaline bottled water (Fiji etc) can cause headaches/migraines. Charolette  Web cbd oil helps with my cluster headaches lately
5987 2018-01-04 15:52:14 For whiter teeth you should try the coconut oil pull! Just take a spoon full of coconut oil and mix it with a little mouth wash then swish it around for 5-10 mins every morning while you’re getting ready and in a week I swear you’ll see a difference!
5988 2018-01-04 15:52:12 these wax cubes i got for my oil burner got my apt smelling eatable 
5989 2018-01-04 15:52:09 just dropped my new bottle of rosehip oil everywhere and i am truly heartbroken 
5990 2018-01-04 15:52:08 so the poor guy gets fired if and when oil prices go down again.... he must love his job...
5991 2018-01-04 15:52:02 物凄くかわいい、、！
5992 2018-01-04 15:51:59 Ah I see, get some of that oil
5993 2018-01-04 15:51:51 Super simple.  1 scoop of #BP coffee into french press - fill french press w/ boiling water.  Then press it. :)  After that put coffee, 2 tbs grass fed butter and 1 tbs mct oil into my #Ninjablender.  I also add one scoop of #BP collagen powder and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  Blend!
5994 2018-01-04 15:51:40 Shown here : Boom. That is what the earth looks like at its best in oil country. Just looks a little light on trucks at the moment. This is what our national parks will soon look like.
5995 2018-01-04 15:51:36 Its Olive and Oil baes in Cascade Mall
5996 2018-01-04 15:51:35 Oil of oregano will help but it’s a time-consuming cold.
5997 2018-01-04 15:51:32 Poor woman. A sacrifice to keep the oligarchy of money and oil in power.
5998 2018-01-04 15:51:31 Coin wax inserts an ivory. Ephor oil bites an ivory worse than its puck.
5999 2018-01-04 15:51:24 @brownbagseafood, inquiring minds want to know: what kind of oil do you use when you grill your daily catch?  many thanks in advance!!
6000 2018-01-04 15:51:24 Luv Grapeseed Oil!
6001 2018-01-04 15:51:06 Thanks. Interesting piece about Russian far East and the Chinese takeover paranoia. RU far East doesn't get coverage in general, and the degree to which it's connected to China and unconnected to EU Russia economically, minus the oil, is interesting.
6002 2018-01-04 15:51:02 Pakistan has the World's 2nd Largest Coal Reserve:
Thar Coal Reserve are around 850 trillion cubic feet which are equal 400 brillion barrels of oil equal to the oil. coal reserves equal 618 billion barrels of oil.

6003 2018-01-04 15:51:01 Oil delivery company had failed me. I was told I can use diesel if I run out. Is this true ?
6004 2018-01-04 15:50:55 Considering that the SNP lie from the bottom to the top that might just be the reason why. They told the big whopper about oil. Lots of little whoppers now.
6005 2018-01-04 15:50:51 @AG People from AL have a lot of intellectual catching up to do.  Case in point.  Jeff Sessions and marijuana.  Apparently, he can't google. Someone at DOJ should show him how to analyze, investigate, research all the historic & medical benefits of CBD oil.
6006 2018-01-04 15:50:43 $156 for a low beam bulb and $120 for an oil change hahaha i need a Honda  asap
6007 2018-01-04 15:50:27 So would you recommend hemp seed oil capsules? I found one on Amazon for a reasonable price. I suffer from constant muscle spasms that make even the most minor movements difficult and painful. Also chronic migraineur the Rx drugs don't help with.
6008 2018-01-04 15:50:26 Meanwhile the other half think Oil is going parabolic.
6009 2018-01-04 15:50:24 No kidding.  Thank goodness my brother/biz partner is back from their vacation. He's at factory waiting for heating oil delivery.
6010 2018-01-04 15:50:19 Are the fries vegan? Or is the oil shared with non vegan items?
6011 2018-01-04 15:50:17 Rubbish!!!!!! And how are other African countries without oil and refinery sailing well. Just say you guys are so much incompetent fellow.
6012 2018-01-04 15:50:03 Smelling like rose water& coconut oil.
6013 2018-01-04 15:49:53 War, death & hell, along with the boring oil age has ended it's time. Time cannot any longer be observed. As the Sun which fades color under the crystal, so does time fade. Benevolent beings take offense & change bad thinking to good thinking. A new world arise. Sundials down...
6014 2018-01-04 15:49:53 Running errands with coconut oil in my hair. 2018 is the year of unapologetics.
6015 2018-01-04 15:49:49 Yep. From 60s Oil bears getting squeezed into Monday.
6016 2018-01-04 15:49:47 taena baby oil ang sagot HAHAHA
6017 2018-01-04 15:49:12 oil?
6018 2018-01-04 15:49:02 I can say that my sister in law is alive because she started using it in oil form when all other cancer treatments failed to kill 14 tumors

6025 2018-01-04 15:48:26 Oil changes 
6026 2018-01-04 15:48:19 i made the same chicken today too, it was so delish ~~

6027 2018-01-04 15:47:57 wow we don’t talk about the miracles of cuticle oil enough
6028 2018-01-04 15:47:55 You can let the pressure destroy you or you can let it crush you in a
beautiful way and produce the oil.

6031 2018-01-04 15:47:47 Palm oil production is only 20% sustainable... rainforest cleared to grow it. Coconuts & cocoa use large numbers of child labour. I wonder if vegans take everything into consideration when they make their dietary choices #OFC18 @oxfordfarming
6032 2018-01-04 15:47:36 $FSLR I think First Solar will rebounce quick since the company is very strong and got a lot of cash plus oil is on the recovering and rebouncing.  Oil is soon very expensive.  Might grab some shares from here at $66 range.
6033 2018-01-04 15:47:33 Simply tell your govt to leave us alone, leave our land alone, stop sponsoring terrorism in Africa and nigeria in particular. Britain should look elsewhere for free oil and gas, our land is already polluted, our people can't get good water to drink again, all thanks to British.
6034 2018-01-04 15:47:30 I use Oil of Olay products. They do me right!
6035 2018-01-04 15:47:20 I’m about to go and get me a oil change

6037 2018-01-04 15:47:12 Is it usually too much water or not enough water? Do you add a bit of salt/butter/olive oil? Also what type of pot are you using?
6038 2018-01-04 15:47:10 The pharmaceutical industry hates the legalization of marijuana for the same reason the oil industry hates electric vehicles & solar/wind power generation... they’re used to the power they wield over congress & they see the end of that hegemony.

6043 2018-01-04 15:46:23 Worth laughing at. One day, very soon; we shall overcome this rigmarole surrounding the oil and gas sector. Indeed, where there is oil, there is war!
6044 2018-01-04 15:46:22 Nothing hectic tho as long as oil change is done when due.
6045 2018-01-04 15:46:19 Arctic oil and gas exploration has been done safely since the 1960s. People don't know that because it's been so uneventful. Before you start Valdez is not in the Arctic. That was transportation/shipping accident. Not exploration or production. Much like North Dakota train wreck
6046 2018-01-04 15:46:12 Coconut oil in coffee. Thoughts?
6047 2018-01-04 15:46:12 How do u make the oil

i have $40 left and my car needs an oil change barely starts in the cold has less than a quarter tank of gas and no windshield wiper fluid

and if i did do that favor i would have to pay for gas again
6049 2018-01-04 15:45:51 Pence wants to install another Shah, steal all of the oil and natural gas, and get a much needed port for Russia. Obviously Russia and the CIA are stirring this uprising behind the scenes, & don't care how many protestors are killed. Evil, and not even original.
6050 2018-01-04 15:45:32 also oil smuggling has been a major revenue source for ISIL so Iraqi & Turkish officials have been lining their pockets for a while

6052 2018-01-04 15:45:16 @realDonaldTrump Infrastructure- Why not make Utilities and States responsible for infrastructure repairs? A certain percentage of their huge profits has to go for repairing infrastructure, tax free. IT, Big Oil, Gas & Electric all contributing.

Eat the right foods at the right time

Diet is 75%!!!

6095 2018-01-04 15:42:02 Whoa! This article is full of mistakes, mostly related to the engineering stuff. Cars are harder to start in winter because the oil viscosity is higher. Aluminum has a higher coefficient of thermal expansion than iron, so engines are actually really loose when freezing cold.

6103 2018-01-04 15:41:19 Ugh. :( I have several loved ones for whom CBD oil and MM have been lifesavers. I'm really worried. 

FWIW, there are some CBD manufacturers who I trust that I could recommend to you, if that's helpful.
6104 2018-01-04 15:40:55 A productive day: figured out just the right spot to oil on my desk chair to stop it squealing like a wounded pig when I sit down.
6105 2018-01-04 15:40:52 You didn't have a DAMN Thing to do with it. Russia still shipping oil to NK. Chickenhawk 45

6114 2018-01-04 15:40:07 If shale oil production is at ATH then it follows that hedge short should be at ATH. Every 1mmbpd per year leads to ~200k increase in short CL by hedgers/swap dealers
6115 2018-01-04 15:39:59 Diem deh king oil.
6116 2018-01-04 15:39:58 USA is now the Greatest Oil Producer in the World.  
USA will be the largest exporter of oil & natural gas!
Kaboom!
Tired of winning, yet?
6117 2018-01-04 15:39:49 @joerogan @redban Holy shit, Brian. Methanol fires are invisible. METHANOL! Petroleum is raw, out of the ground oil. Not something you put in cars. That segment was triggering to listen to, not because you didn’t know it was methanol, because you don’t know what petroleum is lol

6119 2018-01-04 15:39:26 Ordered some new running shoes and a couple of super industrial strength sports bras. No excuse not to get back into running again now, especially with my pain pretty well controlled with the CBD oil and occasional codydramol. Need to wean off the pregabalin now, horrible stuff.
6120 2018-01-04 15:39:22 Back in the late 1920s & early 30s smuggling oil was such a problem in Texas that the governor declared a state of emergency & called in the national guard & Texas Rangers to put a stop the "hot oil" trade as it was called.
6121 2018-01-04 15:39:12 Wait a minute... If pumping your own gas freaks you out, you probably don't know how to check your own oil, tire pressures, etc. You have no business owning a car, you're a menace to society... take the damn bus #Oregon !!! 
6122 2018-01-04 15:39:06 Holy Ghost! You got that oil on you
6123 2018-01-04 15:39:02 I've heard great things about CBD oil. I may try it for my gout/joint inflammation issues. Have you tried it?
6124 2018-01-04 15:38:47 Putin can now run roughshod over any country in the ME he wants. It makes TOTAL sense and your statement is so far from fact-NO economic reserves!!! Just because they helped elect a corrupt POTUS doesn’t make them our ally. They just gave NK oil & supplies defying the embargo
6125 2018-01-04 15:38:41 @FT of course has a long history of pushing anti-Tesla stories based on dubious claims, a very selective use of facts, and heavy-handed spin.

But seeing @wef propagate their Big Oil propaganda is disappointing.

6127 2018-01-04 15:38:35 Getting my oil changed in a timely manner is the one aspect of car ownership I do well. That car payment is a $%!# every month, this ride better last me for as long as possible.
6128 2018-01-04 15:38:34 Shh, stop being mean to him until I know if he's rich or not. He could be a oil tycoon or a prince or something
6129 2018-01-04 15:38:26 If people can't handle following simple prompts on a screen, life is going to be very hard for them. You don't have to change your oil every 100-500 miles like you would put gas in a car. Knowing how to pump gas should be a basic part of car ownership 
*disabilities excluded*
6130 2018-01-04 15:38:22 Despite the obvious lack of investment from AFC, it is testament to how well the club is run, (financially), that we are wedged between to Oil rich teams.
6131 2018-01-04 15:38:02 I knew it.  I live in Alabama, where Sessions was hatched.  You can’t even get CBD oil in this ass-backward, corrupt state.  Sessions can’t wait to get his grubby little elf hands on marijuana assets.  Investors in marijuana better start bellowing with a loud voice.
6132 2018-01-04 15:37:55 Thank you Michelle Sessions trying to take weed or CBD oil from people really hit a nerve with me.

6144 2018-01-04 15:36:06 The DEA actually moved CBD Oil to Schedule 1 during December, it is being taken from kids who have seizures.
6145 2018-01-04 15:36:02 Of course saves corporations money but at the expense of the people of the United States of America. Rolling back regulations maybe good for corporations but how many people will die because of it? Removing regulations for nursing homes oil rigs, safe drinking water, and 90 more
6146 2018-01-04 15:35:58 Interesting u bring that up; u know ofc then that a competing system to HD White's was proposed by Keynes at BW, centered around a neutral rsv asset he called the bancor.  Whole pt of my orig gold/oil tweet above is China is setting up Keynes' BW system using gold as the bancor.
6147 2018-01-04 15:35:19 Ugh! Mine comes in through a closet in my bedroom so I have it mostly closed up and use only for storage of non fabric items. Dryer sheets, a charcoal deodorizer bag, and oil diffuser are my bffs in the winter.

I was angry at first cause it’s more money, but it’s a blessing finding out now and not having a blow out and needing a tow

6182 2018-01-04 15:32:14 to be honest I don't like animal-style fries anyway -- too soggy! the magic is in the crispiness of the french fry... I used to get them "well-done" but I think you could practically wring the extra oil from those fries, so I stopped :(

6195 2018-01-04 15:31:46 But how does that compare to the mozzarella sticks, Jeff? And this thrill and amazement comes from the same guy who was thrilled and amazed at discovering the quick oil change 35 years after its inception.
6196 2018-01-04 15:31:45 Funny you say that. I used peppermint oil in my diffuser last night! Lol I’ll try it. Thanks girl!
6197 2018-01-04 15:31:38 the oil top is not clear, it may be in already, it may jump to 62.50-63.00 area if 61.40 holds here, we may drop here to around 60.00 and then make a new high around the same area...im just holding a small short until its settled

EIA Natural Gas Inventories

NG up 3 cents prior to report

- 206 Bcf vs Bloom consensus of -221 BCf

This puts storage at 3,126 Bcf

Down 5.8% YoY

Down 5.8% (not a typo) to the five year average. 

Oil inventories in 30 minutes.
6206 2018-01-04 15:31:00 It got NK and SK talking, so there's that. Whether this is legit, or a delaying tactic by the north while they figure out what to do about their illegitimate oil deliveries being cancelled remains to be seen.
6207 2018-01-04 15:30:56 Good point! The tank costs wouldn't be that much (thinking crude oil storage tanks), but diesel does have a shelf life. But I guess you could just keep recycling it out and sending it to gas stations. I wonder how big the 2nd order OPEX costs would be to maintain it?
6208 2018-01-04 15:30:54 OIL DIFF: 6.33 -> 6.33

6217 2018-01-04 15:30:01 There fire on the mountain . separate oil from water they cannot mix. Biafra must come to settle this killings. Pastor who is the VP is equally silent and happy with the trend of things. This is how to make Nigeria great again according to him.
6218 2018-01-04 15:29:59 Nonsense assertion! That story has been around since Obasanjo regime. Kachikwu is just as clueless as his boss. He is the official TALKNALIE of the oil industry
6219 2018-01-04 15:29:47 if u use toner, only use it on your chin. you'll want to sleep with some kind of oil or lotion at night, almond oil, bio oil or even vaseline if your skin is dry and flaking. put it on for about ten minutes then wipe off the excess so u dont get it on your pillow or anything
6220 2018-01-04 15:29:42 I literally drink about a gallon of water a day, still do workouts, and use Coconut Butter, Vitamin E Oil, and Coconut Oil multiple times a day. If I get strech marks, I'll be so devastated..

The oil & gas industry does pre-employment and random hair and UA tests.

6254 2018-01-04 15:26:04 Steve Bannon, take a shower. Burn the green jacket. Change the oil  in your hair. Stop cursing. Fix your face - it's melting. Try one fucking shirt at a time. Go away.
6255 2018-01-04 15:26:03 Ok, now i cant stop thinking about rice pudding, but more specifically rice pudding thats made with coconut oil just so it has something other than vanilla and jam to taste.....right stop thinking about food, exams are looming!!! But now i'm hungry!!!
6256 2018-01-04 15:26:01 As a kid, mate, i still do this now. "oh that extra £300 coming in we could us that for a holi....oh yeah I need to buy oil for the heating....yep....ok so maybe we could just buy a mars bar then?"

6261 2018-01-04 15:25:21 The only reason they speak out about Iran is money/oil. Where is the outarage about Yemen and the crisis there?

6265 2018-01-04 15:24:48 dont chant modi modi .this govt is worst of all.nothing increased rather decreased in every sphere.oil price.railway.gas price.groceries.interst rates.u r a failed govt who can only suck middle classes blood.
6266 2018-01-04 15:24:35 Well, if you consider the spread of the Taliban, ISIS and Al Qaeda a good thing, and you consider profits from Iranian oil going to US corporations and shareholders rather than Iranians a good thing, then maybe. I, however, strongly disagree. I'd like to see a secular Iran though
6267 2018-01-04 15:24:08 it may sound crazy but the models im using both say oil could test the 26.05 low from feb 2016 from this area we are at now over time, not saying i believe it, keeping an open mind
6268 2018-01-04 15:24:07 Thank you @SenBillNelson for standing up block measures that would reduce safety standards put in place after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster. Living in Destin, I saw first hand the horrific environmental & economic impacts.

Alcohol also breaks your phone if it falls into a pint of alcohol. Also if you replaced the oil in your car with alcohol, alcohol will wreck your car engine.

6276 2018-01-04 15:23:08 They must’ve worked! Why else would they agree to what they did if they didn’t need the cash we & EU  have? If they can’t raise $s anymore by selling oil they don’t existThat’s why sanctions work against Iran

6301 2018-01-04 15:20:18 I’m afraid Sessions will go after that too. My plan is to try the oil long enough to see if it works as well before renewing my medical($200 just to be allowed to use medical).

6328 2018-01-04 15:17:56 Isn't the fact that they haven't' stopped importing from Saudi oil despite the recent record production proves the opposite of the argument?

6337 2018-01-04 15:16:51 I load up on protein and high fiber carbs and salad. The salad and olive oil fat helps me not insulin spike as much and so does a couple tablespoons of apple cider vinegar with lemon and water. I'd definitely ask a dr too.

6339 2018-01-04 15:16:38 @realDonaldTrump Home heating oil on average is $3.00 a gallon. The average tank size is 275 gallon. So$3.00 a gallon x 275 gallon =
$825.00 per month in winter and in summer if a oil boiler burner is also used for domestic hot water. Price gouging GREED!

6352 2018-01-04 15:14:39 There are salespeople and there are snake oil salesmen. The latter do not deserve a national platform.

6355 2018-01-04 15:14:30 It'll just keep getting better. Texture will change, breakouts basically don't exist. Even though you're using oil, your skin isn't oily. You'll look like a kid forever.

6364 2018-01-04 15:13:34 Yes; there are some good reviews of the quality of various fish & krill oils on the market available on line. Haven't personally reviewed them but one that looks reasonable is Nutri-Gold triple-strength fish oil. Note supplements not much help unless excess omega-6 is addressed.

6374 2018-01-04 15:12:30 最近めちゃくちゃ乳首張るんだけどこれ以上乳腺が発達すると雌牛としてミルクを出しかねない。雌牛になって雄牛と仲良く草原の草食べるのも有りよりの有り。
6375 2018-01-04 15:12:16 Went to @Walmart to get an oil change and new wipers.  Told 45 minutes. Waited 2 hours. I never said a word. Manager gave it for free “due to wait.” I get home and see my windshield is cracked and oil skid plate broke. Asset protection said it couldn’t of happened there. Lol.
6376 2018-01-04 15:12:15 There is nothing honorable or heroic about killing Iraqi children in the name of oil.

6379 2018-01-04 15:12:12 Choosing to become a teach instead of working on a dangerous oil rig and getting paid less for that decision is not misogyny. 

Sexism might exist in rare cases these days, but it's not a national issue.
6380 2018-01-04 15:12:08 Oil rise, PMI rise vs Rent decline... the battle lies in the Core CPI and PCE numbers for that 3rd and 4th rate hike while yields inverting is a reality in 2018
6381 2018-01-04 15:11:55 Same thing happened to me! Try the charcoal must and moisturise with coconut oil at night
6382 2018-01-04 15:11:53 On this basis, the Court has dismissed a recent challenge to Norway's recent grant of new oil & gas leases in the North Sea. 2/2
6383 2018-01-04 15:11:40 Was this person's life lost along with $6 Trillion in wars in the Middle East fighting for oil?  Standing or kneeling is irrelevant.
6384 2018-01-04 15:11:38 Tonight I did: oil-based cleanser + facial wash + toner + eye cream + essence + tea tree oil for pimples + face mask. Took an hour. I think mainly bec I waited for the oil and essence to be totally absorbed before the mask. Hala effort pa.

6389 2018-01-04 15:11:18 @BrainLoading we have to go oil shoppin when im back bri
6390 2018-01-04 15:11:13 I just had  a 1hr oil massage and got my titties and booty cheeks rubbed on 
6391 2018-01-04 15:11:13 When another govt comes and finds that the 3b for oil prospecting and 1b for boko Haram fight was stolen like under GEJ,  KEMI shall also be culpable. It's simple. Even though I don't have a candidate, but in my own opinion, to which I'm entitled,  NOI is not what we need.
6392 2018-01-04 15:11:05 Only Oil prices makes the variation in the cost of airline. 

Now Almost all flights have (70%) occupancy 

So there is no issue of poor ticket sales. 

We should hv a cap on pricing. (Tickets should be charged cost  per miles )
6393 2018-01-04 15:10:59 Fuck yo I knew I should have re-up’ed on my wax oil son I wanna smoke so bad lol
6394 2018-01-04 15:10:58 "A package of strong economic data this week, including higher oil prices coupled with new money coming into the market, has helped propel the Dow across 25,000."

6401 2018-01-04 15:10:26 Totally, you'll never go back to old school moisturizer (basically water and chemical trash) again. Best move you could make for your skin. I also use jojoba and rose hip oil.
6402 2018-01-04 15:10:25 Fish oil hahahaha
6403 2018-01-04 15:10:19 It captures your oil painting style so perfectly, you got that blocky creamy look down pat & it feels warm and tangible!
6404 2018-01-04 15:10:16 สิ่งที่กลัวที่สุดคือไปรู้อะไรที่ไม่ควรรู้เห็นอะไรที่ไม่ควรเห็น.
6405 2018-01-04 15:09:59 @realDonaldTrump As a Senior Citizen & supporter, please Do Not impose New laws on Marijuana!! I have Lyme disease & the oil made from the plant helps soo much!!Big Pharma wants it Gone! U say opioids Are Bad-They Are -Please Stop Sessions  on reversing Bill!

6416 2018-01-04 15:08:47 Good... Now maybe quest for more ways to get car manufacturers off oil. We're now smarter than oil.
6417 2018-01-04 15:08:43 When you have to free the oil drain plug with a rubber mallet, that's a bad sign, right?
6418 2018-01-04 15:08:43 //กอดซุกกลับแน่นๆ หลงแสงสีเสียงมหาลัยไปหน่อยค่ะ ไม่คิดจะเยอะแบบนี้5555 แต่กลับมาแล้วค่ะ รักพี่ขิงเหมือนเดิมนะคะ 
6419 2018-01-04 15:08:40 Yes Iranians like all former petrostates, will have to change fast to create competitive, innovative, technologically-sophisticated market economies. Otherwise major fall in national income as oil exports end. Gas might help for a while.
6420 2018-01-04 15:08:34 Add daily doses of raw honey and black seed ( or the oil) to your diet. Drink lots of lemon water to alkalize your blood.

6423 2018-01-04 15:08:01 I will be in the bed all dam day.. oh i must get my oil changed. 
6424 2018-01-04 15:08:00 I have terribly neuropathy in my legs/feet.  I live in OH so no legal medical yet but I have found CBD oil to be pretty effective.  Just FYI.
6425 2018-01-04 15:07:42 Sanctions are a pretty good modern way to grant trade monopolies to underworld types on big volume goods  like oil or weapons.
6426 2018-01-04 15:07:42 What kills me is that the only people who refute climate change are fossil fuel companies and those who are employed by them or lobbyists that serve them. Big oil wants us to think they're not responsible for climate change, so they pay people to lie about it. Follow the money.

6428 2018-01-04 15:07:35 Meanwhile, I'm sitting here getting an oil change on my work van and they just told me my battery is dying. Perfection.
6429 2018-01-04 15:07:33 Florida leaders deny climate change and removed those words from all state documents so they support oil, fracking and off shore drilling to support the oil industry.
6430 2018-01-04 15:07:31 oh that's interesting! i don't think i've seen any of your oil paintings, so i did not think towards that as a reference. i think it's an approach that really works for you either way!
6431 2018-01-04 15:07:30 Some one sneak cannabis oil into his brownies quick!

6435 2018-01-04 15:07:11 I am praying for 'oil to go down to 58'

Don't ask why, I don't know myself.
6436 2018-01-04 15:07:08 ถ้าเมื่อไหร่ที่เราไม่พูด ไม่บ่น ไม่งอน ไม่โวยวาย ไม่เรียกร้องอะไร มันแปลว่าเราเริ่มถอยห่างจากความรู้สึกรักมากขึ้นเท่านั้น.

6445 2018-01-04 15:06:31 Expensive Imported Liquid Natural Gas, we should be using inexpensive domestic Utica and Marcellus gas, only 200 miles away. At this moment, oil continues to be the largest source of New England Electric Power generation.
6446 2018-01-04 15:06:14 That is true. Oil was the first medium I ever tried to paint in. I quickly realized that I needed to work up to that. Lol

6454 2018-01-04 15:05:39 Waiting on hold AGAIN with @PetroHome to get our oil delivered. We have automatic delivery but somehow they let it get to empty, we called yesterday morning and they said we were on the list for delivery. Nope! Still no oil delivered.
6455 2018-01-04 15:05:39 So first he fell from Namjoon's chair on his butt and now he slipped on oil.. That man is clumsier then Namjoon..
6456 2018-01-04 15:05:24 oh! i'd never really thought about it that way. the way i used to oil paint tended towards blockiness, so i was trying to kind of feel that out in digital I guess? It's nice to hear it lives in the same world as my other stuff.

6498 2018-01-04 15:01:45 @realDonaldTrump oil is NOT more important than all of the innocent lives destroyed over the greed for it. Talking about situation with Iran, & shouldn't u be focused on getting kim jong put away, to not have to worry about him & North Korea can know some peace????

6515 2018-01-04 15:00:34 Greenpeace just lost the trial to halt oil exploration in the Norwegian Arctic. The judge in Oslo ruled that the government is not accountable for emissions from Norwegian oil when this occurs abroad. This is absurd. Global warming doesn’t stop at the border! #klimasøksmål

6571 2018-01-04 14:54:31 I beg to disagree. The harmful environmental factors associated with refining crude oil is far more than what a Country like ours that is still grappling with addressing basic & systemic corruption can manage. I say till we fix our homeland, lets refine anywhere else but Nigeria.
6572 2018-01-04 14:54:25 Scaramucci is nothing but a snake oil salesman. Smooth talking ass hole.

6574 2018-01-04 14:54:19 @Scaramucci Wow, you are slick at controlling the message. You sound just like Trump...a con man & snake oil salesman.

Therefore you will likely be back in the Administration for how many months is left. 

Truth? I wouldn't trust you with any of my money. None.

6622 2018-01-04 14:49:43 So, for $1.5 trillion in additional deficit, you've gotten a few workers less than $20/month for one year, increased insurance costs, increased internet costs, pristine Alaskan wild areas destroyed for oil, increased state and local taxes, and less money for charities. Good job.

6657 2018-01-04 14:46:19 I went on the 'Not in my name' march & bitterly opposed the Iraq war but the idea that the war was for oil is a canard. If you wanted to make that argument you'd need to demonstrate where the US had seized Iraqi oil assets and you won't be able to do that because they didn't.

6664 2018-01-04 14:45:10 what? owning huge amounts of natural resources like oil and gas
6665 2018-01-04 14:44:52 Ah - you mean the fraction of the money we pay in? Another Unionist lie which has been debunked again and again.
That’s without mentioning the 40 years of oil and gas which has been wasted by WM.

6686 2018-01-04 14:42:41 I don’t mean to butt in, but have either of you tried cbd oil? My mom has fibromyalgia, arthritis, muscle spasms in her back, etc. and it helps her. Sadly it’s not a cure all, but she has some quality of life back. She’s also noticed that red meat, pasta, and sugar make it worse.
6687 2018-01-04 14:42:27 You can't be half real... water and oil don't mix... so you either a fake muthafucker, or a real one...

6689 2018-01-04 14:42:12 Nope, I've just quoted the article which explains Chavez's role in in the demise of the most oil rich country in the world. You deny Maduro is currently implementing socialist policy?

6693 2018-01-04 14:41:47 @Scaramucci just received a pay check from Trump since he is back on @SRuhle gaslighting. Of course @SRuhle is turning out his lights. I just feel the oil & grease dripping off of @Scaramucci His dry cleaner bill must be tremendous.
6694 2018-01-04 14:41:27 The US and the Venezuelan oligarchs have been sabotaging the economy for years. The fall on the oil price was the last straw. Chavez failed to implement a socialist plan & didn’t start the process of a workers democracy
6695 2018-01-04 14:41:13 A tbs of Coconut oil before bedtime! Make sure water hydration is up also.
6696 2018-01-04 14:41:13 The whole article is libertarian AND supply side snake oil.   US corps are sitting on trillions in cash because there is no demand. This tax cut, heavily weighted to top 1%, will not in any significant way improve demand.
6697 2018-01-04 14:41:05 To much oil interest as well as to  many underhanded deals to be exposed for European countries to speak out!
6698 2018-01-04 14:41:00 Switch those leakers out for great big water pipes. We can live without oil but not without water. Filthy floodwater needs to be captured, cleaned and sent where it's needed. Get off your asses and do it.

6709 2018-01-04 14:39:53 Watching the #SenateHearingOnFuelScarcity and i have a lingering question in my head...is there oil in the North? Call me sentimental...Yes! But the DPR & NNPC seems like a Northern affair.
6710 2018-01-04 14:39:17 Perhaps we should save the hyperventilating 4 when Trump starts topping GW Bush. He has't used fake Intelligence reports to sentence thousands of Americans & millions of foreign innocents to their deaths, completely destabilize the Middle East for oil profits & create ISIS....yet

6715 2018-01-04 14:38:38 Amboi. Kalau olive oil tu dah jadi premium sangat dah tu. Sure manis ni. 
6716 2018-01-04 14:38:25 I find the sugar melts a bit into the oil, which is nice (also, I like the extra bit of scrub)...oats are more gentle. And rosehip oil sounds *amazing*! I just use olive oil because it's in the kitchen already! 
6717 2018-01-04 14:38:24 Winter = deep conditioning, hot oil treatments, pre-poo, protective styling.

6723 2018-01-04 14:37:57 In fact, the slogan should be 'it's Shetland's oil'. And Shetland doesn't want any of their 'independence' nonsense.

6778 2018-01-04 14:34:40 What people want depends on what's available. It's not an accident that American oil companies worked to take out city tramway systems all across the country into the 1950s. It's not like there's a gene for liking cars or some essential car-liking essence conferred by birth.

6788 2018-01-04 14:33:21 Well that would be pointless After all the wars by USA and allied forces has been about feeding the jealousy of oil. Burning it would mean USA would starve...

6797 2018-01-04 14:32:14 This is the biggest risk to the economy. Higher oil prices Inverted Yield curve, and recessions have coincided in the past.

6806 2018-01-04 14:31:40 Isn’t sugar a bit harsh though? The crystals have sharp edges which I would think could cause micro-lacerations on skin (that’s is already dry and damaged). And what would you say are the benefits of olive oil over eg. rosehip that I currently use?
6807 2018-01-04 14:31:32 Not about money. We are in the death grip of the oil & auto industries that oppose any notion of public transit. They will.take down this whole country & are well on their way
6808 2018-01-04 14:31:19 All and I mean ALL energy companies gouge prices and drive prices up, even when oil is abundant. It’s what they are good at. How about some statistics on the average cost per kilowatt hour to the average American!

6862 2018-01-04 14:24:30 It is always right to declare such authoritarian governments like Iran, North Korea, China are bankrupt. Every one knows that. The key issue is what/how to deal with them. It is not right, as a foreign leader, to pour oil on the flames when protest has turned violent.
6863 2018-01-04 14:24:29 First day back adulting and up bright and early at the car dealership to get an oil change.
6864 2018-01-04 14:24:21 It is question of where the hardearned money of duped flat buyers is being used to oil the  law loopholes for an easy escape. Hope we find someone who can plug them and help buyers like us.

6878 2018-01-04 14:23:06 Also Mr @JZarif, read Eric Reinert's book "How rich countries grow rich and poor countries stay poor". Tehran economic policy should be removing redtape & corruption but at same time overtax oil/gas sectors to subsidize growing technological sectors with growing returns

6880 2018-01-04 14:22:53 Bit of all three! Depending on how much you rinse away, the oil will stay on your skin (you can rub it in as a moisturizer), and the sugar or oats will exfoliate.
6881 2018-01-04 14:22:51 Been really sick for the past 3 days so earlier, I mixed 2 drops of Young Living Lime Vitality oil in a glass of water and drank it. I don’t know if this is just placebo effect but I don’t care. All that matters is that I instantly felt better!!!

6885 2018-01-04 14:22:28 They don't and that's the truth of the matter. Look around in IT, oil pumping plants, engineering, accounting and so  on. These are all high  paying jobs you see mostly men doing. Women get paid just as much when they do the same job.

6897 2018-01-04 14:20:36 The connection between arap ajali aka mashamba and those women pouring some oil on the roads to deter road accidents is overwhelming!
6898 2018-01-04 14:20:35 Please remind me again, Ellen. My brain is fried after last night. Was that oil supposed to come out of Kharg Island? Thanks
6899 2018-01-04 14:20:34 Cannabis expert replying. Yes it can be absorbed through the skin as THC is oil based. Take internally for best results.

Hope this helps you out my friend. I can elaborate if required.
6900 2018-01-04 14:20:00 The Minister says it's shameful that we can't refine our oil & some peepz will criticize the dude! When it was suggested we sell them to private individuals, some peeps with strike artillery will come out. My own advise is SELL IT on Olx jaree. @Gidi_Traffic @OLX_Nigeria #Nigeria
6901 2018-01-04 14:19:57 Yes. I personally think every president elected since I've been alive has been working for either oil, pharmaceutical, insurance, or banking corporations. Republican vs democrats at the top are divided by this, not political ideology. Interestingly P. Trump is real estate 
6902 2018-01-04 14:19:56 It’s crazy. S is putting olive oil and coconut oil in everything, including her coffee and my food. Turns out I like olive oil but only get to have it until my supplement arrives...
6903 2018-01-04 14:19:48 You are just validating my point. Most western countries are dependent on the income from car sales. But norway isn’t because of their income from oil, so they can afford not taxing electric cars.

6905 2018-01-04 14:19:31 .. Only you cant count 

Where's the 13bn a year coming from??? 

Take your time.  The snp don't know.

Tip : its not oil
6906 2018-01-04 14:19:27 Coconut oil 
6907 2018-01-04 14:19:23 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
6908 2018-01-04 14:19:08 I buy MCT oil in 55gallon drums to use in fatCoffee - all of it, ALL of it, regardless of brand, comes from the same 2 manufacturers, regardless of the branding. 

Also, 1/2 tbsp per day is all you should start with. Add butter, virgin coconut oil, cocoa butter, etc. to taste.
6909 2018-01-04 14:19:07 Understanding the present is really the key Just like the #TaxScamBill it's all about the GRAFT. 

We will get there- once the GOP is pays back their Coal and Oil Industry donors. 

Oh yeah, and Putin and Trump can get access to that Oil Reserve in Russia

6912 2018-01-04 14:18:52 Funny how U.K. attacks the “axis of evil” eg Shiite Syria, Iran etc in order to protect Sunni Saudi etc. Yet the terrorists in Europe and ISIS are Sunnis!
Funny old thing oil.
6913 2018-01-04 14:18:48 Any smart person knows the way to a girls heart is snacks (and puppies) I’ve already received snacks. Now if Quick Lane had a puppy play room I’d be getting an oil charge every damn day 
6914 2018-01-04 14:18:44 Wow the coconut oil in my hair solidified
6915 2018-01-04 14:18:39 Oil is over $67 a barrel. But I had to sell all of my stock during the Obama recovery.
6916 2018-01-04 14:18:31 I’m constantly bloated so- hhn u w u But if you can’t fart you can try applying some oil on your tummy. The one that stings.

6919 2018-01-04 14:18:20 Why not fight against the heroin/opioid epidemic? Or is that too tough for you to deal with @jeffsessions ? Do you realize that medicinal/recreational marijuana has numerous benefits? Next you'll be taking the CBD oil from kids that have seizures. You won't win this battle!
6920 2018-01-04 14:18:03 @Oil_Check @CruzJackson what it do Homies
6921 2018-01-04 14:17:57 Oil has nothing to do with the snp other than they put all Scotlands chips on oil and it came out red  

Luckily over 50pc of the population didnt want to play reckless slipshod with their futures.

You should learn a lesson.  The snp are reckless irresponsible & incompetent
6922 2018-01-04 14:17:55 thank you i will add oil this month and perhaps yumcha lesser from now on LMAO

6924 2018-01-04 14:17:27 My eye is itching, can I put a drop of coconut oil? Does it help? 
6925 2018-01-04 14:17:25 The problem with the US is that it differs with the ruling power. I think Republican Regime = High Oil Prices
Democrats = Low Oil Price
6926 2018-01-04 14:17:24 But taehyung ask for help in your gc. How can he ask for help if he slip on the floor with that fcking oil ? You are being mysterious babe
6927 2018-01-04 14:17:17 Are your oil stocks depressed?
6928 2018-01-04 14:17:13 And anyone who is worried about emissions from our oil patch should look up "flaring"

6932 2018-01-04 14:17:02 There's this oil that called Squalane by the brand Timeless that you can get for $12. It's so amazing and works as a hydrator AND an antibacterial if you have acne prone skin. Its so good

6935 2018-01-04 14:16:41 Oil change place isn’t too busy tho.. they already took my car back and it’s only been 5 mins.. plus they’re giving out snacks again 
6936 2018-01-04 14:16:37 Right. Putin was assurred taking crimea ,  its port and off shore oil would result  in no U.S. repurcussions of significance after checking crookeds and uma's email.
6937 2018-01-04 14:16:35 Ethanol has no toxins and carcinogens and replaced octane boosters like lead and MTBE. Look up MTBE! The oil companies refine 83-85 octane gasoline. Ethanol is a non toxic way to boost the octane to 87. I only burn E30 and E85 in my car!
6938 2018-01-04 14:16:32 oil? seokjin? namjoon? hmm
6939 2018-01-04 14:16:20 Amen brother.... we are as good we producing oil and natural gas as we are at hockey.... I would say we are even BETTER.   We should be proud of our people and our resources!!!!!

6945 2018-01-04 14:15:39 Realized I’m almost 2,000 miles overdue for an oil change and I’m driving to Fort Wayne then Chicago this weekend 
6946 2018-01-04 14:15:27 Exactly! I agree with you. I see the Middle East, Nigeria and some other oil majors becoming very unstable. But it wont last for a very long time.

I see a lot of jobs becoming redundant in our lifetime.

6983 2018-01-04 14:11:12 Personally, I don't think we will drift away from oil in our lifetime. The process will begin quite alright, but it'll be very very slow. Plus, the insane politics behind oil won't let it be.

7006 2018-01-04 14:09:14 As soon as the oil runs out. You feeling better Wendy?
7007 2018-01-04 14:09:10 I have been bearish on oil marketing stocks like HPCL, BPCL, IOC for most of last year. Waiting for min 25-30% correction from current prices to invest in them. All look like topping out on monthly charts.
7008 2018-01-04 14:09:06 I think that algo should be tuned to day trading horizon, as oil has 5-10 times more volatility than currencies and always react on macroeconomics and other events everyday. Currencies and stock indexes has no such reaction on macroeconomics as oil as they are longer term assets.
7009 2018-01-04 14:09:03 have y'all been oil pulling with some coconut oil??? good 4 u honey
7010 2018-01-04 14:09:00 There would be sharp fall in oil prices soon..many think that it will reach 90-100 soon.I do not think it will happen sooner .
7011 2018-01-04 14:08:57 if you only use it to make french fries, its worth it. i was shocked at how good they came out with no oil
7012 2018-01-04 14:08:49 who was in the kitchen? There's no way an oil would walk to the bathroom by itself tf
7013 2018-01-04 14:08:48 and where did the oil came from
7014 2018-01-04 14:08:46 Oil like cooking oil? Or body oil? Lotion ? Shower gell ? Whatever since it’s a bathroom
7015 2018-01-04 14:08:37 Americans run clubs like business. Oil owners run clubs with ways of making more money than selling talent. Look at city, balancing books and not selling. Look at arsenal and us, being forced to sell to buy.
7016 2018-01-04 14:08:36 Omg heck yes!!
7017 2018-01-04 14:08:29 Yes i know....but nothing was done particularly after 2015 BECAUSE of oil price plunge

7082 2018-01-04 14:03:32 Yes, I agree the main thing is we need to check is how much oil these countries consume compared with the first world countries. The first world countries consume far more than the other countries, plus they dictate the market.

7095 2018-01-04 14:02:12 Unfortunately my 8 year old Daughter’s @CanniMed CBD oil that controls her Seizures is not covered.  At over $400/month it’s a big expense.
7096 2018-01-04 14:02:09 OPEC is responsible for the higher oil prices, not Trump. Also civil unrest in Iran and Libya are pertinent to it.

7102 2018-01-04 14:01:16 And I'm not a big gov't guy either. However, I do think use of subsidies for things like this are far more appropriate than those that go to oil&gas companies, or to other businesses that operate with very high net cash flow/margin.
7103 2018-01-04 14:01:16 There will be few jobs and the oil belongs to Canada.
High risk for little gain except what lined the pockets of the politicians.

7135 2018-01-04 13:58:12 Oh I'm sure the oil companies would comply, they're only there because they're not loosing to much and can cover the costs else where, even if they did comply how much would that raise per year?

7171 2018-01-04 13:54:28 Yes! It’s a marvellous bit of kit. For doing chips you need to coat them in oil first. It’s great for sausages, nuggets, etc. All the easy kids things. I even reheat pizza and leftover kebab in it.

7181 2018-01-04 13:54:08 The world is moving from oil. This is where I think the US might get it wrong. France has banned new licenses for O&G exploration. Europe will follow suit.

7185 2018-01-04 13:53:27 If Nigeria can exchange our mineral resources like oil with Technology  instead of Dollar and Bounds, corruption will reduce no one will  embezzle money and the Technology will help to build industries that  will create jobs 4 our youths, then use Agriculture to exchange 4 money.

7197 2018-01-04 13:51:46 You are talking about oil why people are there in benue state killing and sloughtering human bodies like goat and cow
7198 2018-01-04 13:51:29 As a production technician in offshore oil and gas I was often redeployed to help out other departments in times of high workload. We called it teamwork Richard. But then never having been out in the field doing a proper job you wouldn't know about this I suppose
7199 2018-01-04 13:51:26 Yes David, about 3 weeks worth. The only Western country without 3 months of oil reserves. Our oil & diesel mainly comes from Singapore- don’t think US is going to help us here

7230 2018-01-04 13:47:14 @MorningBlend969 @muddasick imagine hemp oil assisting with the hundreds getting treatment for cancer.  Its assists with pain and cramping + increases appetite.  Is the medical community afraid of the financial loss because of reduced medicine sales.
7231 2018-01-04 13:47:11 Considering we are an oil based economy, they knew the ramifications, and pushed through anyway.

7255 2018-01-04 13:44:12 This is because of corruption and economic sanctions, and the development of the oil sector on the detriment of other economical sectors (agriculture, commerce , etc.)It was much better in the times of Chavez

7261 2018-01-04 13:43:28 The reclamation is not passed on to the taxpayer. It used to be if the oil company defaulted, but the orphan well fund was set up and money is from oil companies. If companies default, money is from the fund.
7262 2018-01-04 13:43:26 Subsidy. When say crude oil prices crashed to $28 under Buhari, the unsound MONETARY SYSTEM ensured FX Echange devalued and landing cost still stayed high and pump price was increased. How does TOTAL DEREGULATION solve that?  Think and stop tweeting nonsense!!

7270 2018-01-04 13:42:29 He mentioned in same speech that " No state will receive anything less than what it currently gets from oil rents". 

Truth is, true fiscal federalism allows everyone to develop at its pace. We already have fed govt tax policy in place. Atuku hasn't committed himself to anything
7271 2018-01-04 13:42:29 People would just dust their briefcase oil importing license to start dollar rackeeting again. It vicious cycle or returning to old order.
7272 2018-01-04 13:42:23 I think it's not much of a priority anymore. The harbors along Mass./CT are. I think oil barges still come up.
7273 2018-01-04 13:42:11 doh! actually thought it said 'stop quack' next to the duck oil #doubletake should've gone to specsavers....(other opticians are available the judge and Lawgistics do not endorse any one company)
7274 2018-01-04 13:41:46 It is an interesting application of solar thermal harvesting for heavy oil recovery. There is one in Oman. Wud b nice if they used it for other industrial refining too.
7275 2018-01-04 13:41:30 Again like a simpleton you've just spoken. When you have an unsound MONETARY SYSTEM that ensures when crude oil prices rise like it was under GEJ to about $100 per barrel and yet FX Exchange stays static at about N160/$1 then landing cost stays high and they still had to pay/1

7429 2018-01-04 13:23:20 So much of our country grinds to a halt when legal, and planning meet. How come we can build oil fields in the ocean elsewhere but can’t get our own shit together?

7431 2018-01-04 13:23:06 #OOTT Question, what did oil prices do last time Mt. Saint Helens blew it's lid.?
7432 2018-01-04 13:22:58 Right, so we have to compare EVs cost of fuel with diesel/petrol vehicle cost of fuel. And as per your argument you have to look at cost of extraction of crude oil and not just cost of diesel at the gas station?
7433 2018-01-04 13:22:55 I ask you a simple question. Fuel imported at say N80/$1 to N305/1$ which would be cheaper? If you have a MONETARY SYSTEM that sees FX Exchanged stiffen and static even with higher earnings from crude oil sales, and gets devalued when crude oil prices crash how is that not a/1

7442 2018-01-04 13:21:01 We can share info I'm a newbie to them both. So far, coconut oil and tea tree oil can heal an abscess in a couple of days! I'll keep you posted on anything else I learn

7444 2018-01-04 13:20:33 "at our own pace" I am lost here. We have some people who can afford to go to Dubai for lunch everyday and on the other hand we still have citizens who still regard cooking oil and meat as luxuries.

7446 2018-01-04 13:20:17 Try just a drop of Castor oil rubbed between two fingers and applied to the ends of what natural lashes you do have (and on your eyebrows also). It helps lashes and brows grow. Of course it takes a while, but good things come to those who wait :) The extensions might like also.
7447 2018-01-04 13:20:09 Scotland's environmental protections are being re-designed by the #salmon industry by stealth. Aquaculture Growth Plan 2030 written single-handedly by industry includes demands for an "enabling" regulatory process. Kind of thing oil companies do in Africa. #SadForScotland

7463 2018-01-04 13:17:52 That's because they haven't planned well. Hoarding is an option if the goods has no close substitute.i.e Monopoly or oligopoly as the case of oil marketers. Even the danfo drivers do this by all deciding not to move until they have a crowd and boom! They increase the price

7465 2018-01-04 13:17:15 My statement had nothing to do with subsidy. It's simple that two main factors control fuel pump price namely : Crude Oil prices and FX Exchange and of the two we can control one as its internal. Yet you claim FX Exchange (part of a MONETARY SYSTEM) is not a preeminent problem

7505 2018-01-04 13:11:17 I also like this macroeconomic approach as it never fales in oil trading. When a lot of data is issued you just need to identify which is more important at the given date. December data is more important than November. Pipeline cracks are more important than any other data etc.

Oil of course is needed just we don't need to be dependent on Arab oil

7583 2018-01-04 13:00:19 Just 4 days into 2018 I have already faced, oil spill on face and rashes on skin from insect bite.
7584 2018-01-04 13:00:16 Call it by it's proper name, its the Jamie Oliver hypocrisy tax, not a sugar tax. Next time watch his shows ans see how much heart attack inducing fats / lard / oil and salt he uses in his cooking.
7585 2018-01-04 13:00:10 Do you have anything to say about the reports that Russia has been selling oil to North Korea?

7587 2018-01-04 12:59:41 you can accomplish more by making sure that there are enough inspectors in place to inspect the offshore drillings rigs, if you don't want them to drill for oil than stop using it, simple fix

7592 2018-01-04 12:59:26 I'm actually doing okay with carbs. Since cutting out bread, I've also cut out cheese and butter cuz I was only eating them with bread. I love coconut oil. I found a great lentil Marinara recipe that's delish with spaghetti squash and am trolling YouTube.

7597 2018-01-04 12:58:58 @realDonaldTrump As reports on oil reserves are stated as overflow or stock pile.The average price is $3.00 per gallon, the average oil tank for home heating at 275 gallons for for 1 month cost of $825.00! Price gouging / democrats or both?
7598 2018-01-04 12:58:21 Every time I buy natural peanut butter from @StopandShop the "seal" is slightly open and the peanut oil is leaking out. Is this a flaw in sealing? Or does the oil weaken the seal?

7614 2018-01-04 12:56:00 And the need to fight/fund two wars the previous administration had gotten us involved in as well as a massive oil spill to help clean up, natural disasters, etc. I don't see any member of congress willing to forgo their pensions or exorbitant salaries in good faith to help.

7622 2018-01-04 12:54:53 OPEC's oil reserves aren't getting any younger. They will lose control sooner or later. But in reality oil is doomed. I can charge an electric car from the solar panel on my roof for a fraction per km of the cost of oil.
7623 2018-01-04 12:54:32 more an eco worrier than eco warrior. My lot are now going to buy butter instead of margarine because it doesn't use a plastic tub and is palm oil free.  Palm oil plantations robbing the orang utangs of their homes.
7624 2018-01-04 12:54:16 Mix some coconut oil and lavender essential oil or eucalyptus together and rub it on your legs, rub it on your feet also and put on thick cotton socks to absorb it into your body. You will feel better and the soreness will subside. #LiveWell #essentialoils

7671 2018-01-04 12:48:46 Well, I make fun and I know how to change oil but I don’t think the comparison is appropriate. Pumping gas is considerably easier plus you can always take your car to the shop to have your oil changed.

7673 2018-01-04 12:48:30 If you say so. I think the era of really cheap oil is over now. Since  around 2004 or so the growth rate in conventional oil no longer keeps up with world demand; only unconventional oil at $50 or so, keeps the game going. Doubt it will get better.

7711 2018-01-04 12:42:16 So what does Bio Oil do for us?
7712 2018-01-04 12:42:03 A performing Giant of Indian Corporate World. Congratulations team Indian Oil.
7713 2018-01-04 12:41:51 มีปัญหา
7714 2018-01-04 12:41:45 Damn I can’t use coconut oil, it would break me out like mad. Nothing that goes on my skin contains ethanol, you can be sure! And I do use oils as my last step as outlined in an earlier tweet! I find sheet masks very wasteful and expensive but I def do need to do more masks 
7715 2018-01-04 12:41:44 Okay so you must do a tonne of cardio or a train like a beast to eat all that. My issue isn't sugar, it's fat/carbs. Lebanese food. It's good fats but I love my olive oil and feta cheese 
7716 2018-01-04 12:41:41 Irony. A city built on oil, selling electric vehicles.
7717 2018-01-04 12:41:31 Police are reporting an oil spill on North Shore Road, stretching from Flatts to St George's. Motorists - particularly those on motorcycles - are warned to drive with extra caution.
7718 2018-01-04 12:41:21 Corium yenza amanga with it Argan oil, my facial skin is coming right.
7719 2018-01-04 12:41:16 Oil price depends not only from supply but more on demand. Demand depends on consumption, consumption depends on GDP, GDP depends on macro data where Manufacturing is the most important as goods transportation by tracks and by ships need a lot of gasoline and oil.

7721 2018-01-04 12:41:03 @foxandfriends @AP just wondering why @POTUS called out China for selling oil to NK but did not call out Russia for doing the exact same thing - Putin owns trump
7722 2018-01-04 12:40:59 My sleep seems to be slowly improving plus my ability to fall asleep, but I've done too much to point to one thing that might have been the reason for this change - unrefined coconut oil (Walmart brand), less sugar for past week. Possibly eating more - need to  verify.
7723 2018-01-04 12:40:48 あいかさんと誕生日同じだ(°0°)!!
7724 2018-01-04 12:40:32 Remember when I said the oil companies said it was too cold to produce natural gas too cold right I remember those same people will tell you about global warming too and that's your fault you take a crap too many times a day that causes global warming
7725 2018-01-04 12:40:20 the ad style for the 2018 midterms is just going to be a white suburban Dad changing the oil in his f250. No music, no overlaid voice, just the Dad changing his oil.

7736 2018-01-04 12:39:24 They’ve been having “talks” long before you were in the picture... Why don’t you worry about Russia lying to your face or making a fool out of you by selling oil...
7737 2018-01-04 12:39:04 Quite a few spikes, though, have been driven by regime change wars, or because oil was a safe haven investment immediately prior to a market correction. Just like the Bitcoin bubble ATM.

7774 2018-01-04 12:34:11 So for example if you take yesterday oil price. 2 days ago USManufacturing PMI showed growth in US. It means that forecast on ISM manufacturing is wrong and it will be higher. Therefore traders start to buy oil right after positive German macro data and continue to buy after ISM.
7775 2018-01-04 12:34:09 Tax cuts are spending. That’s not liberal lunacy. Again how much did you make in profits from the tax bill in oil pipeline deals ??

7802 2018-01-04 12:30:39 @Boilerjuice hi charging a £3 service charge and then a card processing fee is not transparent, not impressed. How about you just quote the real rate for oil and play fair like everyone else?

7806 2018-01-04 12:30:21 I trade oil everyday. Every my mistake cost my real money. So I calculate impact of each macroeconomic data on oil. It depends on difference in forecast from the previouse fact and difference of the fact from forecast. If the difference is high then price movement is high.
7807 2018-01-04 12:30:10 Oil is looking very strong...

7809 2018-01-04 12:29:59 Longobardi, me parece no es lo mismo lo de oca con lo de indalo, oil cobraba a sus clientes el impuesto que tienen los combustibles, y luego no lo pago a la AFIP.
Eso no justifica lo de oca, pero no es lo mismo.
7810 2018-01-04 12:29:54 And California is broke and almost bankrupt and won't get their own oil out of the ground, totally beyond stupid. They will expect the rest of us to pay down their debt and I say screw them.....and wind farms are a complete waste of money.
7811 2018-01-04 12:29:40 But it will make #Failed45’s Saudi & Russian friends & business partners richer & happier. Russia, in particular, has been needing oil prices to rise to improve their economy.
7812 2018-01-04 12:29:36 Like Tim’s employees we’re screwed.  Heaven forbid a barrel spike in price because of war, natural disaster or any excuse the oil companies deem fit.
7813 2018-01-04 12:29:31 Exfoliate only twice a week max. Drink water. Ensure none of your products contain ethanol. Sheet masks are life. Apply oils as your very last step. I swear by coconut oil for my psoriasis.

Your mischievously highlighted clip points out the obvious: as oil prices increase so will the amount being spent to subsidize fuel.

There is NO oil producing country selling PMS less than N145 without a subsidy.

7828 2018-01-04 12:26:19 Also. When oil went through the roof, food was packaged in smaller containers yet sold for the same price to fool consumers, airline prices skyrocketed and extra fees were added. When oil went down the big wigs benefitted. Average Americans are always screwed.

7856 2018-01-04 12:20:50 Cheap meal kids fav. Chop 1onion saute till transparent in a little oil. Add a tin of tomatoes paste, 1/2 t mixed herbs, pinch of salt, pinch of sugar, stir. Meanwhile bring a pot of salted water to the boil add spagetti. After 11mins drain,add to sauce. Grate cheese on top.
7857 2018-01-04 12:20:49 Try pickled vegetables. Try vegetables you haven't tried before. Try them different ways: roasted, deep-fried, stir-fried, in a soup. Try each of these things several times. Put stuff on them: hummus, garlic, lemon juice, chili oil.

There's really no method other than trying.
7858 2018-01-04 12:20:49 Oil! T.T Use olive, coconut, almond, any kind of oil in a pinch and then regular face soap extra good.

7860 2018-01-04 12:20:40 When we moved to WY (Dec '62) I noticed all the plugs hanging out of the front of people's vehicles - asked what that was & they looked at me like I was stupid.  (Just ignorant) Learned soon enough what the deal was. Think my Dad got a oil dip stick heater that first year.
7861 2018-01-04 12:20:34 Just visited the @VerdantWorks museum in Dundee with my neighbour Albert & wife June. Such a great insight into Dundee's textile industry.After 12 years I feel properly Dundonian! :) Joke here is that the jute industry lasted longer than the oil one in Aberdeen :)

7869 2018-01-04 12:19:50 Because public education, defunded through the use of those funds by Democrat city managers, is so great, that kids don’t deserve the choice for fed vouchers to private schools, instead? & poisoning the environment? CO2 & oil are natural to it. Gonna have to do better than that.
7870 2018-01-04 12:19:43 You underestimate effect of macroeconomics on oil. It gives bigger immediate impact on prices than EIA reports. GDP big difference cost $1,5 dollars at the date of issue, PMI and ISM cost $1-$1,5, other macro cost 50-70 cents. Pipelines shutdowns cost $2 and traded 1 day only.
7871 2018-01-04 12:19:41 Well here we go the foreign oil companies doing what they do best telling us they were about to create a fake shortage

So the constant threats push China to isolate NOKO more bc they don’t want war on their doorstep. Last time Noko came to the negotiating table, ‘03, China cut off the oil.

7932 2018-01-04 12:08:08 It repeats the idea that certification could make e.g. palm oil have no ILUC impact. In what kind of dreamworld is it realistic that certification of an individual acre can control a global trading system with infinite replacement options?

7970 2018-01-04 11:59:31 Another thing you should keep taking goods and oil going to N Korea. Let our military use it and keep doing it until the countries helping N Korea either stop or rear their ugly heads then continue to do so even if it is China or Iran. Its a violation of UN sanctions.

8122 2018-01-04 11:35:36 + Why metals are rallying
Investors are buying metals as a hedge against higher inflation and a market correction. Also extraction costs go up when oil increases.

8127 2018-01-04 11:34:32 Why #Iranian regime’s media aired crowds of counter #IranProtests yesterday specifically from #Ahwaz? One answer is,the regime wants 2 demonstrate how oil-rich-province is safe&stable.Other answer,the regime wanted to show that ethnic groups in #Iran are pro-regime but all lies.

8133 2018-01-04 11:32:59 +Why U.S. dollar is weakening. 
Despite fracking, the US is still a net oil importer and oil has been rising. Other central banks are becoming less dovish. The UK has raised rates, Europe's economy is improving, ECB is sounding less dovish.

8135 2018-01-04 11:32:35 from what I gathered from the experts... let it sit for a couple minutes so the oil can lubricate everything, then drive it easily until warm. It'll warm faster if you drive is easily...

What international treaties and enforcements are needed before we have truly tackled that? (I think unrealistic.)
How am I sure my solution could not (e.g. through ILUC) contribute to problems like palm oil? (I think mostly.)

8190 2018-01-04 11:22:50 (2/?)  For this reason, it may be easier to go 180 deg "cold turkey" than try to moderate your way there.  Avos, nuts & olive oil add up calories rather quickly.

8276 2018-01-04 11:11:52 That's hilarious. You leftists have been crying out for 15$ minimum wage for years and all it took was Trumps tax cut to achieve it not some government mandate that would've cost people their jobs. Also I guess you haven't heard about ANWR oil fields Might want to google that gem
8277 2018-01-04 11:11:44 That's why he worked night and day while Hillary rested, because he wanted to lose? 
Absurd crap
8278 2018-01-04 11:11:41 Is the emissions from our oil production, and burning up the same oil/gas, included in this calculation? Or do that come on top of it?

8282 2018-01-04 11:11:17 So if you heat oil properly to correct temp and place fillets in it gently, it won't absorb as much oil as you think. Also paper towels to soak extra. You can also reuse the oil for frying other things or mixing with atta to make flavoured chapatis/theplas.

8293 2018-01-04 11:10:12 Yep, I agree. I have heard the argument that criteria for palm oil used for biofuels are stricter than average so could improve overall production conditions, but IMHO in general palm oil - as the situation is now - is really problematic.

8423 2018-01-04 10:47:03  When should you change the car’s motor oil and filter?

Many factors -like the car’s brand, the model, the year of manufacture or the way of driving- influence in this decision.

8442 2018-01-04 10:43:13 My skin got really dry and flaky last year all of the sudden the beginning of last year and what helped was switching my face wash to one for dry skin, exfoliating every other day and using a moisturising face oil everyday after washing my face and that’s literally it

8455 2018-01-04 10:40:48 Amazing how large retailers look to pay people off after profit warnings but don't give pay rises after years of good sales. Same with gas/Electric prices, price if oil increases so do your bills price of oil decreases your bill stays exactly the same. Completely wrong IMO

8579 2018-01-04 10:13:17 Anyone doing #Veganuary ? We have lots to choose from at Star of India.  We use vegetable oil in most dishes rather than ghee and most of our base sauces do not contain any dairy or other products unsuitable for vegans.

8581 2018-01-04 10:12:46 I totally agree with this! I try and avoid palm oil as much as possible BUT it’s in almost EVERYTHING and unfortunately a lot of vegan products. Everyone is just doing their best and sometimes certain things are unavoidable when you are already trying to avoid so much!

8611 2018-01-04 10:06:02 yes, any style you prefer. In the end, result is the same. Brew styles are important for people who are finicky about taste...ahem. Adding ghee/butter and oil is going to mask the coffee taste anyway, so don't bother with the method.

8619 2018-01-04 10:04:31 The palm oil thing is so annoying. It is so hard to avoid regardless of one’s diet, so why bring it up as such as deal breaker when someone’s trying to go vegan?! Switching to veganism is a big enough change without having to think about everything else at the same time.

8694 2018-01-04 09:51:15 How could a slum-dweller surviving on reservation and getting a seat without his intellect can actually buy something rational. They will only consider it snake oil and continue to be what they were since ages.

Deliveries might get a little dicey during a Nor’easter. Was the NE-ISO winter reliability program stockpile supposed to be used to keep prices under wraps? How long?

8706 2018-01-04 09:47:32 It’s nearly 2am and I can’t stop watching videos about oil cleansing and facial massage.

8707 2018-01-04 09:47:04 Can you believe that the government n oil marketers blame the scarcity on hurricane catrina. No matter what they do my mouth will speak louder that ever in preparation for 2019
8708 2018-01-04 09:46:29 @focusnigeria until the business of downstream oil totally drops the "poison" of subsidy in all ramifications there will ever be a potent cesspool of criminality and an unending scrambling for looting - the PIB will give an in-road towards unbundling these hopeless strongholds!

8711 2018-01-04 09:45:37 We used to burn oil for heating but rapidly replaced it as heat pumps became an option. Requires clean electricity though.

8714 2018-01-04 09:44:33 Dear Omar: In 2016 non-oil revenue represented 43% of GCC governments' revenue, up from 31% in 2016, coming mostly from corporate taxes. In KSA, corporate tax is 20% max, but reaches 85% in oil & gas. Saudi family companies, big & small, are all taxed under a different system.

8769 2018-01-04 09:29:48 I always hear laymen using the term "oil rig". I don't feel the need to pompously dismiss what they're saying on the basis it's actually an FPSO or production platform.

8772 2018-01-04 09:29:35 You said it..... "spewing".  The environmental standard for producing oil in Middle East and human rights are atrocious.  Canada cleans up mother nature's oil spill using various tech, and you think we are the bad guys?

8779 2018-01-04 09:28:49 SNP painted oil as basisnof economy. Oil subsequently lost 99% of its value.

8780 2018-01-04 09:28:44 Hurts but it’s not stealing when it’s given to you. We didn’t see the value in a precious “stone”. We’re doing the same thing with our oil.

9007 2018-01-04 08:34:43 No, it’s said to be palm oil tankers flushing out at sea. It poisons fish which are washed up but also lumps of it end up on the beach. Dogs like it but it’s fatal to them.

9017 2018-01-04 08:33:04 ..if the price is adjusted to N150 per litres today?

..what will happen if crude oil falls back below $40 per barrel?

Will monetary base be kept constant- and allow fiscal austerity hold?

or monetary base adjusted again?
9018 2018-01-04 08:32:51 Is that how reserves of crude oil are treated? I’m no pro but I suspect not.

Phela this guy killed the legendary Pastor Chris Oyakilome and his people by just selling oil.
9036 2018-01-04 08:30:47 The answer to that question is somewhat complicated.

is it that consumption of oil is growing in real terms?

is it the income of Nigerians driving consumption growth?

or are we looking at nominal growth - a result of rapid growth in monetary base?
9037 2018-01-04 08:30:26 etapi tadi sempet kepikiran baby oil juga sih, sebelum akhirnya baca ulang dan ternyata baby lotion..

9056 2018-01-04 08:27:23 I wouldn't sound so happy Mr.Motorwala. We all rely on imported oil. Your Motorcar will be more expensive to run too!

A healthy political debate is good. But your comment takes delight in the possibility that the branch u are sitting on will be chopped.
Misguided schadenfreude.
9057 2018-01-04 08:26:52 Thanks :) Luckily paracetamol seems to be taking the edge of all of it but it's awful. Haven't had earache in years lol. Clove oil never worked for me for tooth ache though. Warm salt water does though.
9058 2018-01-04 08:26:51 Probably some of the foundation or concealers you use are not oil free and non comedogenic. And most importantly any time you use makeup, make sure you exfoliate after you take it off to remove all the dirts and build up stored up in your pores. I think this should help
9059 2018-01-04 08:26:46 Do you have dry skin? Try to moisturize right out of the shower. Pat your skin dry allowing some moisture to remain, then apply oil or cream

9068 2018-01-04 08:23:50 have you met the dollar? Its purchasing power goes down everyday, when it does go up, its artificial. Meaning oil prices fluctuated so it will buy you more gas but will not make your meal cheaper.

9097 2018-01-04 08:17:21 Heavily implied, but they didn't just pump the fast, usually they checked the oil and sometimes washed the windows. So if you didn't tip, you were an a-hole. But also when you've got $5 for gas, you can't really swing gas and a tip. Mandatory full service sucked.

9260 2018-01-04 07:53:18 Americans did not get all the jobs Obama created. You can create jobs and probably still won’t get them. Obama also didn’t bring back nearly the amount of jobs that have been lost in the 50 years. The oil and steel industries have lost millions of jobs.

9274 2018-01-04 07:52:05 Jones:European powers more circumspect, and not only because the protests cut across their plans to cash in on the Iranian government’s offers of oil concessions and cheap labor. They fear the destabilizing impact of mounting class struggle in Iran on the entire Middle East.

9293 2018-01-04 07:48:11 @DaveHcontrarian I'm thinking that fracking and the dramatic (continuing) decline in US net oil imports may have imposed a structural change compared to previous cycles that would cancel out typical late-cycle USD weakness.

9299 2018-01-04 07:47:01 The oil.
The oil lands you your dream job.
I want to see if it has worked.
9300 2018-01-04 07:46:49 @DaveHcontrarian I'm thinking the USD weakness last yr was driven by global cyclical economic bounce which is now set to fade. Tend to agree with you that oil has probably about topped, but thinking no 2nd leg to USD. Gold could still have a flight-to-safety rally but uncertain.

9305 2018-01-04 07:46:09 At the time I thought it was a mistake to gift half the club to a Saudi with no oil revenue & fully expect it to go pear shaped. If McCabe was honest I'm sure he'd admit, if he could go back, he would do things differently? I just hope it doesn't affect the club.
9306 2018-01-04 07:45:55 I think music needs a lot more of that kind of high octane poeticism right now. Things have been self-referential and silly for the past decade or so, which is great, but the world is damn serious now. That guy's music dissolves frivolity like oil in soap.

9311 2018-01-04 07:45:11 Stop exploiting the critical situation in Iran for your pattern, you do not help in this situation - but pour oil in the fire - and harm the people demonstrating. I know diplomacy is not part of your repertoire but think twice before you twitter, even if it is difficult for you.
9312 2018-01-04 07:44:48 Tea tree oil works wonders

#TraderTalk
9316 2018-01-04 07:44:38 @DaveHcontrarian I'm thinking you might be wrong on your forecast for another leg down in the USD. Have you considered that previous late cycles have involved rising net oil imports (petrodollar driving USD weakness) which have declined & are declining dramatically in this cycle?
9317 2018-01-04 07:44:38 You have the same amount of oil & money which is used to finance terrorism.

9331 2018-01-04 07:42:19 Utterly wrong. The main problem is the CO2 produced converting oil to plastic. Most packaging is unnecessary or should be paper.

9367 2018-01-04 07:38:54 It affects skin types differently but it mainly just clogs pores and is only good for extremely dry skin so jojoba or hemp oil are better for your face!

9379 2018-01-04 07:36:05 Winter gasoline extra build is seasonal as it is cheaper to refine oil for winter blend gasoline. Also, EIA NUMBER today could be very different from API NUMBER, any bearish number could cause a major long over dyed oil price correction.

9393 2018-01-04 07:33:11 It's about profit for polluters, but there's a political and philosophical dimension. Kochi make money on oil, but their political project is also about selling anti-govt libertarianism. They idolize invididualism, but climate change means policy must be based on mutual reliance.
9394 2018-01-04 07:33:06 Loll I don't wanna waste time arguing something that doesn't make sense. You told me to fuck off)  after I said My opinion.  God damn isn't social media foe opinion? ? Hahahhaha OIL DIZZY

9398 2018-01-04 07:32:36 You can bet your house on it..Trump has promised war with Iran  FOR OIL, rather than war with N.K.  which is diversionary. If Human Rights was even vaguely an issue..Trump/Maga’s should to be just as vocal on     & of course good ole .

4. Liquidity will be comfortable
5. Trade deficit to widen as higher oil prices
6. Fiscal consolidation continue

9450 2018-01-04 07:21:49 why do all these people in historical novels always have oil in their bedside tables? no one just keeps oil on hand, what’s it for?? is it lamp oil? because that’s a bit concerning......what’s with the oil???

9486 2018-01-04 07:13:30 Lots go into this—1st, most larger arab economies produce oil, exporting elsewhere. 2nd, most Arab manufacturers produce the same industrial products that colonizers deemed profitable. It’s not easy to change manufacturing facilities without market research and investment

By your rationale, US crimes against others justifies half the countries of the world invading the US immediately.

9820 2018-01-04 06:17:32 How bout ... NO!  Terrible deal for the Oil.  It’s not enough.
9821 2018-01-04 06:17:19 想定が分からないけれど、物価を考えてしまう。Aを想定すると、周りが２０００万に合わせた価格帯になり、１０００万の生活は苦しいのでは無いかな。Bの場合は逆に、２５０万に合わせた価格帯となり、５００万は生活が楽なのでは。
9822 2018-01-04 06:17:13 honestly just oven roasted with some coconut oil and garlic is one of my faves, they're super tasty

When I watch debates I'm all about the verbal.  Women have an extra dimension with the non-verbal to key on simultaneously.  Tell us who is next.

9856 2018-01-04 06:11:23 There's much to be debated why oil prices are doing what they're doing. Though it's fairly clear that higher oil and the Indian economy don't mix very well.
9857 2018-01-04 06:11:17 Just add some truffle oil at the end and it'll be fine.

9862 2018-01-04 06:10:37 Due to many engine moving parts proper lubrication is needed to avoid damage to it. Lubricating oil in the engine ensures it is in good condition, but over time that oil breaks down.Changing your oil and filter will help your vehicle’s engine continue working at its best .

9865 2018-01-04 06:10:08 Agree with most, but our drilling HURTS Russia by lowering oil prices worldwide.
9866 2018-01-04 06:10:01 Kuwaiti oil price up 2 cents to USD 63.80 pb
9867 2018-01-04 06:09:53 INR at highest level in more than a year against USD. Not helping exports and the strength in oil cannot be good for inflation and disposable income.

9870 2018-01-04 06:09:20 Bulletproof coffee? Big tspn of Coconut oil & tspn butter stirred into dark roast (less caffeine) coffee w turmeric sprinkled on top. Everyone needs coffee ( :-) ), but the oil (in lieu of cream) might be enough of a laxative to help. And shockingly, it tastes really good
9871 2018-01-04 06:09:03 @SGTreport regarding your utube topic on end times. Russia and Iran/Turkey prophecied to make war with Israel from North to take a spoil or her bounty oil, agruiculture, etc.then Antichrist to come in to save day with Mark to buy/sell.

9884 2018-01-04 06:06:38 The only way we could be more self sufficient regarding oil would be to nationalize the resource.

It's quite funny how conservatives in Canada inadvertently advocate for socialism without even knowing it.

9901 2018-01-04 06:04:19 Who got some oil
9902 2018-01-04 06:04:15 Are we not extrapolating too much of the oil price rise due to political situations in the long term economic story. However,  about the valuation of Indian stocks... that's a tough topic to sustain.

9941 2018-01-04 05:57:22 The underlying reason for the expected rise in oil prices:

9957 2018-01-04 05:54:27 ... Rockefeller was a genius and the meritocracy (ie free market) rewarded him with that. By producing oil more efficiently, he could sell oil at a less expensive price. This drove his competition out of business. Instead of innovate, his competitors turn to big gov.

9959 2018-01-04 05:54:12 For a stuffy sinuses: Hot steamy water with a drop of peppermint essential oil. Toss a towel over your head and breath in peppermint-y steam. Also manuka honey.
9960 2018-01-04 05:54:05 It’s a pre-poo routine i originally saw on Naptural85’s channel. I’ll grab the link to the video. I’ve been doing it for a few weeks now and SWEAR by it & the oil mixture she talks about in it (i adapted mine w/ my favorite oils)

9967 2018-01-04 05:52:53 I would claim that corporatism is a result of such handouts and that in a free market, near monopolies would due off due to economies of scale and leader stagnation. Much of the driving factor for the anti-trust laws implementation was standard oil and their innovations. ...
9968 2018-01-04 05:52:42 Not a fan of olives but love olive oil too (it’s a texture thing for me with olives). The food I most dislike is lima beans. Actively dislike, hate actually!
9969 2018-01-04 05:52:26 Yes... it's like the conservative party didn't run Alberta into the ground after their 40 year run! They also think Notley and Trudeau set oil prices! #OPEC

9972 2018-01-04 05:51:44 HOLY SHIT OLIVES. They are disgusting. They ruin everything, from tamales to hummus to pizza. You can't un-olive food. Olive oil is usually just as bad. Spanish olive oil is ok, it's less olive-y than most.
9973 2018-01-04 05:51:16 オリーブ油で毎日を楽しく(*^_^*)
9974 2018-01-04 05:51:15 Pro tip: don't dip your right index finger into 350°C oil.
9975 2018-01-04 05:51:15 warm salt water rinses often, ice your jaw, clove oil - dab it right on the gums not too much or you'll puke, and 1 Tylenol + 1 Advil they work better together - sorry for you that really sucks
9976 2018-01-04 05:51:01 oil bath just changed my life
9977 2018-01-04 05:50:59 Trump calls out China for giving oil to North Korea but when Russia does it its fine
9978 2018-01-04 05:50:58 Can't believe some people think you pump oil out of the ground and put it in your car  Let the Koch Bros cut off US oil filters and see how fast you run out of gas.  
No oil filters, no gas.
9979 2018-01-04 05:50:54 งั้นก็ดั้ย รอเรยยย จะให้ดีก็มาติวให้ด้วยฟฟฟฟฟฟ
9980 2018-01-04 05:50:53 Please pray for me & car situation I had to get my car towed home and it’s finished, it’s been a headache since I bought it with computer problems but all my oil leaked out of it when I was driving to work for some reason? It’s done.
9981 2018-01-04 05:50:40 @NileRed2 So in working on my engine, I got to thinking: can octane be synthesized from fatty acids? Say, from, caprylic acid derived from coconut oil? If you synthesized it, it would be the second "goat acid" you've made. That's fun, right?
9982 2018-01-04 05:50:29 เห่ยเพียวก็อยากเข้าสิ่งแวดล้อมมมม พี่ออยยยยยกี้ดดดดดดดดดดดๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆ
9983 2018-01-04 05:50:22 Hahaha, I think the Chief’s could probably score a couple power goals against the Oil. They would definitely play a shit load more intensity than these muffins

9987 2018-01-04 05:49:45 Indeed & when they judge you w/knowing the amount of pain you're coping with..Gosh..to hear all this whilst feeling so much joint pain is heartbreaking. I tried to explain my situation,teach compassion, total failure. Ended up on my own,less painful.

A bottle of fez-wearing cooking oil leaping from the top rope.
9999 2018-01-04 05:47:49 2Ki 4:7 Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest.
10000 2018-01-04 05:47:46 So the sharp decline in US inventories yesterday that resulted for pipeline shut in has nothing to do with it? Or the Saudi export cut to the US and China? When it come sto oil, Germany is not even on the map!

10013 2018-01-04 05:44:56 Once socialist state now run by corrupt despot Maduro who gained control by invalidating Congress, barred opposition party elections and gagged media from speaking against his regime. Maduro has consolidated state oil, which is 90% of GDP. So deflated oil $ = chaos. Nice try.
