34 2019-02-04 23:43:41 When researching/ investing in stocks do you place more emphasis on strong reliable dividend potential or fundamental capital growth potential? #dividend #stocks #StockMarket #capitalgrowth #investing #investment #ASX #income #wallstreet
35 2019-02-04 23:43:30 How can you add ROI?? If you have $100 invested in the highest yielding stock (129%), you took home $229. If you inv. on the lowest (almost 24%), you took $124. If you split that $100 into a combination on the stocks on the graph, you get a value btw $124-$229. Never $420 or 420%

37 2019-02-04 23:40:57 Such a whining, Fed manipulating frog Cramer is. Stocks go down, we must investigate, its the algorithms... Stocks go up... Happy Cramer. The last ten years have created a lop side outcome which will end badly for Cramer & Co. Many tears.
38 2019-02-04 23:40:45 @OddStockTrader Hey Cody, quick question for you sir, why has the volume been low lately for some stocks? For example, Look at $NFLX 1 minute chart today.
39 2019-02-04 23:39:25 So now I gotta give Mexicans my stocks?  Wtf is going on here?
40 2019-02-04 23:37:58 Buy iodine stocks.

43 2019-02-04 23:35:07 Buy uranium stocks! ;)
44 2019-02-04 23:34:29 I totally agree with you here, although it's worth remembering that people with more money do their gambling on the 'markets'. Stocks and shares, banking, stuff like that. 
What you say about bookies in working class areas is 100% true though

50 2019-02-04 23:30:56 No one said anything about no incentive pay for managers. You don't need stocks for that. If your argument is that the increasingly socialized corporation undermines the justification for capitalism, well I Mason and Marx would agree with you. But...
51 2019-02-04 23:30:18 Hey Chuck..Sure would like to know which big corporations fund you..also which stocks do you hold in companies?
I know you have stock in Facebook and big pharma.
52 2019-02-04 23:29:26 All these miracle stocks only go up stupidly when no other stocks are moving are just bored traders having something to do  - don’t confuse the story !
53 2019-02-04 23:28:50 I'm thinking of starting up a bogus penny stock and then falsely inflating the value of the stocks. Then give them to the C of NV in "Lui " of  the $ 6,500.00 I owe them
OR maybe trade for consulting fees

56 2019-02-04 23:26:38 Yup. Holding 18P March and 20P weekly. I’m kind of a counter trend trader. That being said, i will not hold 20P for too long if i see a new high over 25. But i’ll keep adding to my 18P. I trade pot stocks for quite sometimes to understand how fake news works. Btw, no earning Mond
57 2019-02-04 23:26:04 I’ve tried to buy stocks to cover delay. Tariffs are the responsibility of the Tories. If they zeroise them they will have no bargaining power for trade deals. Stuffed.
58 2019-02-04 23:25:30 Pensions own those stocks too Bern
59 2019-02-04 23:24:34 Limited stocks only 
60 2019-02-04 23:24:05 Wrong.  That number includes 401ks and Pension Funds, so unless you consider teachers, police officers, and other people who’s invested their retirement in 401ks, a majority of stocks are not held by wealthy individuals.
61 2019-02-04 23:23:29 Owning bump stocks will become illegal on March 26, 2019?
62 2019-02-04 23:23:27 You socialist are delusional!  You think billionaires have their $ buried in their back yard & you can just go get it. They invest it! Stocks,bonds,companies etc. You ever get a job from a poor person? They already pay the most taxes & almost half the country doesn't pay any!
63 2019-02-04 23:22:54 It's because VZ is cut and dry and not like Iraq at all except for the one inevitable result of USA oil stocks
64 2019-02-04 23:22:54 That wont happen. Too many goverent officals have stocks from weapon/equipmemt manufactures. Its why the Army changed uniforms 4 times in 10 years. Sadly they are just different colors with the same crappy velcro pockets.

67 2019-02-04 23:21:48 you should look at the bank stocks on the ASX to see the impact it's had- my CBA shares are up 4.23% *rolls eyes*
68 2019-02-04 23:21:38 Apple Stocks rising 
69 2019-02-04 23:21:25 Trading Crypto and legacy market is tough though. One sentiment always comes to the other side. Was way to bearish in the end on stocks maybe.
70 2019-02-04 23:21:14 Software continues to outperform the market. My favorite mid cap software stocks are:

$MDB

Large Cap:
$MSFT
$WDAY

Cloud, Data Analytics, Storage, AI, ML, and just staying competitive are all driving software higher.
71 2019-02-04 23:20:07 good question. possible answer: consumer stocks are boring, not exciting, nor sexy... somewhat like last night's football game! 
72 2019-02-04 23:19:31 Meanwhile $MOC just lost a third of its value. With stocks like this cheap can always get cheaper.

74 2019-02-04 23:19:06 word on the Twitter is 

if futures are down at open
  that means buy stocks  LOL
75 2019-02-04 23:19:05 Unless the fund you invest in produces consistently high returns (5% if you invest £20 pcm) then you will lose money. Just speak to your bank about opening a stocks and shares isa. This is just a scam to get people to pony up £1 per month.

85 2019-02-04 23:13:20 I've never seen PS4 or Xbox exclusives as a bad business practice. The respective companies pay to have exclusive IPs to draw business from a competitor. Same thing is happening here it's just a system shock for those who have never had to deal with it before.

97 2019-02-04 23:09:47 What if the Yoplait CEO did a vlog about dealing with depression and then turned to see the price of Yoplait stocks increase and was like "oh shit call in the board meeting I think I know how to save the company"
98 2019-02-04 23:09:38 Never touched my savings till then, cant just sell stock and get money like an atm either. I worked temp jobs... and planned. For as much as one can imagine. Even down to toothpicks.... So the process to get money back from selling stocks... nutshell the government takes a lot.
99 2019-02-04 23:08:32 You're going to make the wealthy 10% pay the other 90% that work for them so much per hour that they can afford to go buy stocks? That's the plan?
100 2019-02-04 23:08:16 "The eople that earned it chose to give it to them." Ok fine. Then do NOT have a stepped up cost basis on transfer of property (real estate, stocks, etc) from the deceased party to the inheritors. If you are not going to tax the income then you should not get a cost basis adj.
101 2019-02-04 23:07:50 Yeah for sure I’m not too picky about what stocks I get as they will be getting an overhaul anyways with black housings, quad projectors, and quad hex halos all color changing! Also I saw you tweet about wanting to get car pics if you want I know some people that do good work.
102 2019-02-04 23:07:24 The moral of the story, own stocks.

122 2019-02-04 22:57:17 At 17 played the stock market game at school. In advanced marketing and DECA FBLA we got to invest meager amounts of money and add to it if we wanted of our own money as a senior. All the while always had a job, used that money and put away into savings or stocks.

Wealth begets Wealth

The stock market is a casino.
It's the Las Vegas for betting on corporate race horses.

Stock isn't a true sign of wealth as stocks aren't actual money. Only a marker of momentary confidence in a corpse.
132 2019-02-04 22:49:32 I really want to invest in stocks. I wish I knew more about it
133 2019-02-04 22:49:16 In fact, 1) stocks are mostly priced on expectations and 3) these (as you know very well) will endogenously generate the money to buy them if needed. 2) Stocks that pay dividends go down by almost the same amount (there's a small liquidity premium yes, but small).
134 2019-02-04 22:48:49 Yesterday - Industry: #SOFTWARE & SERVICES was 18% Positive, with #REAL ESTATE 7% Positive. Stocks: $AUZ was 21% Positive, with $SPX 6% Positive. #ASX

139 2019-02-04 22:46:53 I think he could mean either GARP investors finding moats where they probably don't exist and therefore buying companies which aren't outliers in terms of quality. Or Graham neophytes who buy stocks that are a bit cheap but not outliers in terms of price.

142 2019-02-04 22:45:33 I disagree with several of the assumptions here, Nathan: 1) Stocks are priced on supply and demand 2) Stock prices necessarily go up on aggregate when income is paid to investors 3) Fixed supply of money to buy assets 4) Private enterprise can exist without paying profits.
143 2019-02-04 22:45:30 Never said it was tho, just said that if you invest in stocks it could become something big. You’re already investing into companies when you could also do stocks. Just saying.

147 2019-02-04 22:44:01 I'm using the term loosely & likely technically inaccurate, but not in essence. Buyer & seller are same person or someone so closely related to make no difference. Can be done with stocks, property, etc. Money leaves Russia, shows up in NYC in asset to be sold again.

176 2019-02-04 22:31:03 I don’t have a fixed price target. I am treating this as an investment and I will hold it until it reaches 20% or starts to lose its momentum and breaks a moving average. The very best quality stocks can be held long term as long as they show healthy growth.
177 2019-02-04 22:31:03 You're so full of crap. The economy is doing fine. You should be a champion of it given almost all of your liberal cities rely on pension plans heavily leveraged in stocks. Liberals voted for the dopey health plan.

209 2019-02-04 22:11:17 Just a reminder to investors - following the kind of drawdown we had in December, larger cap stocks move first, then small, then microcap stocks.  Though the smallest tend to move the most.  How much capital you allocate to a specific position should take this into consideration.
210 2019-02-04 22:10:49 If you have a 401k you own stocks. You are not some elite "rich" person(like you). Very slick how now you're dropping to the evil 10% rather than just the super evil 0.1%.

254 2019-02-04 21:46:26 part of it probably has to do with their stocks dropping recently and how the series had had a history for bad timing release dates. something might happen in thr future not under ea involving respawn entertainment but thats unknown only time will tell

266 2019-02-04 21:39:47 @CNBCClosingBell @SaraEisen @WilfredFrost #StockBuybacks: @DianeSwonk : #BrianBrentberg is a right wing nut from @FoxNews. The problem here is companies borrowing in this low interest rate environment to buyback their own stocks #CreditBubble
267 2019-02-04 21:39:44 How is... "Everyone is lowering Guidance" a good excuse to buy stocks?
268 2019-02-04 21:39:39 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
269 2019-02-04 21:39:36 Very disappointed you didn't woof last night when @JuliaLeeAU talked about all the dog stocks she loves at the moment
270 2019-02-04 21:39:07 The S&P500 is trading stronger today, to be at 2725.0 (+0.66%).. Major drivers NFLX +3.38% and ADBE +2.98%. One persons algo is another persons front runner. #lottaalgosoutthere #stocks
271 2019-02-04 21:39:06 I find this hard to believe. Pension funds, 401k plans & individual investors can’t only own 15% of the stocks in this country. Please cite your source @SenSanders
272 2019-02-04 21:38:45 the actual health meters are only efficient in-between stocks. otherwise, i have to judge off the few frames in which they glow after getting hit
273 2019-02-04 21:38:43 U.S. stocks closed higher, on Monday 02/04/19 $DJIA +0.70% at 25,239.37, $SPX +0.68% at 2,724.87, $COMPQ +1.15% at 7,347.54, $RUT +1.03% at $1517.54.
274 2019-02-04 21:37:23 A local supermarket called Shoprite stocks their line but I’ve never been too keen to be honest. M&S is the money shot but the parking’s a nightmare and all their stuff’s so short dated you can’t do a shop that would last any sort of time.
275 2019-02-04 21:36:42 122 stocks "Entered the Building" and 111 stocks "Exited the Building" Monday night. 209 total stocks currently "In the building".. $FCEL $FRGI $FRO $ICBK $MPX $NAT $NEXT $NGVC
276 2019-02-04 21:36:39 But I can pay. I have three retirement incomes, an $800,000 home and a huge portfolio of stocks. And four gorgeous grandchildren to boot.
277 2019-02-04 21:36:39 Very true. Companies bought back stocks with the tax cuts so they didn’t have to pay out dividends to stock holders leaving more money in the company.
278 2019-02-04 21:36:13 My thought on pot stocks those with real alliances have potential. Others not so much this canopy and cronos.  Tlry maybe. Nbev is garbage but still traceable

282 2019-02-04 21:35:44 Strength in technology stocks sent all of the major indices higher as the Dow & NASDAQ try for a 7th consecutive week of gains.  Dow +175
283 2019-02-04 21:35:20 plenty of nice things out there (because apparently the only market of games that exists is the AAA to people lol) but im sure the company that has been known for having horrible release dates for the series and how much Ea's stocks have dropped it's not too surprising.
284 2019-02-04 21:35:02 What can I say. I'm thinking of trading only individual stocks in this environment. $SPX $SPY $QQQ are completely manipulated beyond any doubt.

292 2019-02-04 21:30:09 Everyone knows $GOOGL as most stocks are way overvalued.. Especially as they miss, and have to keep lowering Guidance

That is not a sign to buy into stocks
293 2019-02-04 21:28:49 Listening to a firearms expert on @NPR explaining that many people who own bump stocks will simply refuse to comply with the government’s ban when it goes into effect — apparently proving their point that criminals don’t obey laws.
294 2019-02-04 21:27:41 I’m interested in base metals. I’m interested in the single-digit price earnings ratios

296 2019-02-04 21:26:47 I dont really care. All I care for is the profit and seeing if I execute on a trade. You trade stocks?
297 2019-02-04 21:26:29 I would be sticking that day dick in everything to see what felt best. Pudding, mayo in a baggy, a fuzzy slipper, whatever!!! Jergens stocks would soar!
298 2019-02-04 21:26:26 4this awesome economy we brag about, we desperately depend on on debt escalated to $22T.Stocks are overvalued!FED still keeps rates low at Trump command;last time it increased the rates, the economy crapped. We must work 2-3 jobs to meet life’s means.We’re really doing awesome!:)
299 2019-02-04 21:26:05 Oui, mais je sais pas si ils vont remettre des stocks pour les extras qui étaient déjà sold out.. Comme les Tyler..
300 2019-02-04 21:25:46 Yes i am sure. He's been against free trade, for ending the wars, got rid of tax loopholes and bump stocks, black unemployment is at an all time low...the list goes on. If he were obama democrats would be singing his praises.They just want to trick you into thinking you need them
301 2019-02-04 21:25:41 Highest deficit ever, farmers relying on government subsidies due to Trump tariffs, manufactured S. Border crisis, children separated from parents, nuclear treaties being shredded, lower tax brackets owing for 1st time ever, corps buying stocks back, few livable wage jobs. #FBR
302 2019-02-04 21:25:40 Hey pal, a 401k is made up of those stocks which quite a few people depend on for retirement! Wealthiest 10%, bullshit!
303 2019-02-04 21:25:17 I thought I found an equivalent, I used Moneybox, it rounded up your purchases & put it in a stocks and shares ISA. The only issue is that you can lose some money and it takes two weeks to withdraw money  I’ve heard Revolut is similar but I’m reading the specs now

305 2019-02-04 21:24:39 G3 played all of top 8 on Sunday for 64 right? And 5 stocks instead of the current 4
306 2019-02-04 21:24:23 LOL - amazing how the behavior of stocks work.  Maybe I'll just stick with buying the QQQ instead
307 2019-02-04 21:23:34 The Market has already priced in the RC report.

Now that tells us something is rotten with the system.

310 2019-02-04 21:21:08 Actually you can. That is why the great depression was so bad. But even if you pay cash for stock. What are the government going to take? A certificate? Cause no one will be able to buy stocks. Or houses or yatchs or planes. All value will disappear.
311 2019-02-04 21:20:52 $CSIQ solar stocks will be astronomically higher in two years.  Wise investors setting up now.
312 2019-02-04 21:19:40 Interestingly, going long the underlying (vs taking a synthetic position via stocks) is probably a losing trade. The price of actual pot should drop massively over time.
313 2019-02-04 21:18:55 Stocks have reached a permanently high plateau

321 2019-02-04 21:15:30 The more people drink the Kool-Aid from Jerome Powell, as well as buy stocks on buybacks and PPT, the more they damage the market structure.  Valuations very expensive, and global slowdown is very real.

323 2019-02-04 21:15:10 exact same?  NO. Why?  Well, UEC and lots of stocks had 25 mil share out so could fly easily.  But today UEC has to push 1/2 billion shares so this will retard some crazy moves since M Cap moves too much.  So, this is why WUV is a favorite too.

326 2019-02-04 21:14:25 These days it’s OK to fuss about hedge fund mgrs getting rich as they put their clients money Into Stocks believing justice will prevail. But the media thinks it’s OK to short stocks and make a killing. Shorting is basically betting on failure #fanniegate  So sickening.

345 2019-02-04 21:09:11 Why would we want someone to advocate for clean air and water? We want someone who will make energy stocks shoot up. What’re you, depending on the govt to keep your drinking water safe? Communist.
346 2019-02-04 21:09:03 Fed has kept IR low since 2008. Therefore Corps are able to borrow money cheaply to buy stocks back.
347 2019-02-04 21:08:28 I did surprisingly well and got lucky to be out of UEC and DNN on the day of the first crash.  There was a day when the stocks dropped 25% or so in 2 hours.  That scared me,  So, I gingerly bought thereafter.  But I have friends that jumped in and kept buying more and more as all
348 2019-02-04 21:07:51 The S&P500 is trading to bring your retirement closer today, and currently sits at or near the highs, to be at 2725.0 (+0.66%). This makes it +3.06% on the week. #oneweekmove #stocks #sp500 #stockmarket

367 2019-02-04 21:02:01 I think she missed my sarcasm. But it’s not ancient history, as Brownback recently wrecked Kansas with the theory, and Donnie & Repub’s Tax Scam openly operates on the same basis. Which, of course, again didn’t work, as corps happily bought back stocks,and pampered themselves.
368 2019-02-04 21:01:51 Let me clear it up.

When it comes down to it, i have never worked for a poor man. 

From 1 of the 99% to 1 of 1% I give you 100% thanks

373 2019-02-04 21:00:19 Thank you for your compassion. I think that people who treat their animals this way should be put in the village stocks. A much-missed part of life, IMO. Punishments and penalties are way too lenient .
374 2019-02-04 20:59:40 There is zero reason stocks should have been up today. Zero.

379 2019-02-04 20:58:36 Can't blame the mob for reacting like a mob does if you're placing yourself in the stocks and selling the pitchforks yourself. Fact of the matter is he's openly shown himself to be racist by admitting this and that is something the internet will not forgive you for
380 2019-02-04 20:58:29 What's your plan to fix that and what does this average middle class guy do with my stocks
381 2019-02-04 20:58:21 It's telling me: "BUY STOCKS"
382 2019-02-04 20:58:11 In other words, Congress doesn't want the executives of the company you own to pay its executives in stocks and then pay for the stocks with company money to prop upnstock price?
383 2019-02-04 20:57:46 Nah, i own real estate and have stocks and mutual funds in IRAs

crypto is like this new world market that is just getting started

bitcoin is only 10 years old it's crazy how new it is
384 2019-02-04 20:57:26 this implies every time they buyback they should be undervalued. How are most stocks performing after all those buybacks?

394 2019-02-04 20:53:35 "We would not bet on the US, China and EU comping the 'globally synchronized recovery' comps. Simply put, if our forecasts are correct, the unwinding of this frenzied 'buy stocks now' excitement could be nasty.

397 2019-02-04 20:52:06 :( follow me back king my stocks took a big hit when you unfollowed
398 2019-02-04 20:51:56 The move of $BTT today and from $DLT a few weeks back are cool. 

Very nice. 

Reminds me of the good times, were everything pumps out of nothing. 

As we see them now, I’m sure we’ll see it in the future again and again. 

Why?
Check for instance cannabis stocks.

403 2019-02-04 20:48:48 A few percents of TRILLIONS of dollars of debt represent a LOT of interest to pay. 
This comes at a time when many fortune 500 companies have been buying their own stocks with loaned money in order to puff up their quarterly investor reports.

407 2019-02-04 20:46:19 Everyone can buy stocks.  Some people instead spend their money on other things like alcohol, tattoos, cars, vacations, etc.  Let’s not pretend people spend their money wisely.  Just look at iPhones, Starbucks coffee, night clubs, ....   start buying stocks.  Try SPY to start.
408 2019-02-04 20:46:10 That’s how they got wealthy. Also note pensions that many of your constituents depend on are filled with stocks. Just imagine if SS had some stocks as well like Chile. Then there would be more wealthy households and you wouldn’t have any constituents
409 2019-02-04 20:45:19 $BA on new all times high. If it close above 395 probably will run. Maybe is a good idea to buy on the pullback.

411 2019-02-04 20:43:09 My favourite thing is when Netflix only stocks half the seasons in a series but you don't realize that until you get to what you think is the series finale only to be left dealing with your misplaced emotion investment and a huge cliffhanger #veryimportantproblem
412 2019-02-04 20:43:04 Sacá el promedio y vas a tener un TCE. Además, cuando entran y baja el TC, se incrementan las importaciones y eso lo haría subri. Y cuando salen los capitales golondrinas, eso elevaría el tipo de cambio y la competitividad de las exportaciones. Liquidan stocks y equilibra.
413 2019-02-04 20:42:56 AND HOW MUCH HAVE THE STOCKS JUMPED IN THIS OR NEXT QUARTER?
414 2019-02-04 20:42:43 A lot of y’all are saying you would invest your 10k. 

What are you investing in? You definitely don’t need to invest in real estate or stocks if u only have 10k. 

The BEST investment you can make is in YOURSELF. 

Spend that 10k purchasing courses, going to seminars, books, etc

421 2019-02-04 20:37:19 By investing in Stocks, they allow companies to provide jobs, products and services that make everyone's lives better. It's not a zero sum game.

Want to help them? Let people invest the money taken from their paycheck for Social Security into stocks instead.

424 2019-02-04 20:36:33 That is true, there are less risky investments. Also dividend stocks will give you some income regardless of the stock paper value. I needed to chip away at both. I had to work hard for the money to pay off debt but the money that came from investing was my money working, not me.

427 2019-02-04 20:35:17 There is a store in Emporium Melbourne. Jac + Jack. Stocks a handful of very expensive staples—think plain tees, shirts, and dresses. Sparsely merchandised on wooden shelving. Overseen by moody, distantly-minded looking staff.

430 2019-02-04 20:34:51 of such a policy would probably matter, yes. But that wasn't really my point. Perhaps I should have spoken more broadly and just said "investment" rather than "investment in stocks" specifically.

444 2019-02-04 20:29:20 But if you have hundreds of thousands in credit card debt, student loan debt, medical expenses, and housing debt . . . It's a much more guaranteed return to pay off those assets. Stocks are not guaranteed returns.

456 2019-02-04 20:23:15 Putting the $300 in my savings account into stocks isn't going to change my living situation. Even with a 20% return (which has literally never happened), that's a profit of about $4300. $4300 in 15 years is about $286/year. That's not much. You have to have money to make money.
457 2019-02-04 20:22:55 In other words, in 2005 the Russian authorities didn't know yet that Browder was evading billions of rubles in taxes. At the time they didn't want him in Russia b/c he was manipulating stocks of various companies. Only later did they discover the extent of his fraud. Correct?

476 2019-02-04 20:13:03 2018 was the year of the stock market reset. What does that mean for 2019? The value prop for investing in stocks is straightforward. The market goes through corrections all the time but still delivers returns that, over the long run, are typically superior to a risk-free asset.

489 2019-02-04 20:09:40 well if there was a higher minimum wage across the board, everyone would be affected so there wouldn't be stock with higher returns. But the way stocks work is whole other topic that doesn't change the fact that the gap between rich and poor is far too large and needs to change.
490 2019-02-04 20:09:39 Question - CRON and CGC are both Pot stocks so why a call on one and a put on the other?
491 2019-02-04 20:09:14 He surely discovered the stock market app on iPhone that's there since 2007...

He also (and you) could have seen that when i talked about those same stocks and reasons why it went down HARD since September. They lost over 200 billion in worth...

528 2019-02-04 19:59:18 I have a feeling a lot of it is stocks. Still, I'm sure they wouldn't mind parting with it. But the government has to sell it to use it, and that would probably tank the stock market.

530 2019-02-04 19:58:50 once I get these stocks down packed I won't even need a job anymore
531 2019-02-04 19:58:46 Last qs: do you trade both long (indexes ES/NQ? or only SPY/QQQ) and short (buy puts/short indexes or stocks)? Thanks! Appreciate your transparency on your website!
532 2019-02-04 19:58:14 IMHO, the next level-up is to not have a stocks app on your phone. Cuts down on anxiety.

I check my portfolio occasionally.

great job!! ;-)
537 2019-02-04 19:56:07 I said before....the more pain the workers and working class suffer..... the higher stocks climb and the rich get richer!
538 2019-02-04 19:55:53 @ALbot15 Doesn't mean people bought stocks to actually profit from them. Let's be real here.
539 2019-02-04 19:55:33 Stocks are a financial risk.
Only people with money to spare can afford to take financial risks.
Therefore, you will see more wealthy people take financial risks on stocks.
What is your solution to give people who can't afford to possibly lose money extra money to risk?

542 2019-02-04 19:53:40 Great job SharkStocks!!!!  
543 2019-02-04 19:53:37 Yes! I’m really excited to see OTCs heating up and putting in big multi day runs.
544 2019-02-04 19:53:06 We are witnessing these internal wars, not only in the tech world, but in politics, and the economy in general. This foreshadows things. Not financial advice, but, I personally am pulling everything out of stocks right now. (1/2)
545 2019-02-04 19:52:49 True, but remember stocks take the stairs up and the elevator down
546 2019-02-04 19:52:34 I like the $4.95 a trade, but is that the same cost for OTC stocks as well?
547 2019-02-04 19:52:30 Yes it is normal for weak stocks breaking out w/o volume. Light volume is not what you want to see here as this is a sure sign that this is not the leadership material you are looking for. At ATH you WANT traders to chase the stock and NOT just having a vaccum of sellers imo.
548 2019-02-04 19:51:55 This is how trading stocks can make money. $2
549 2019-02-04 19:50:48 If companies are just going to save if we limit stocks and buybacks, that means fiscal policy is tighter than we realize and we have more room to increase spending.
550 2019-02-04 19:49:10 Pot stocks tend to do exceptionally well between Jan-Feb, lets hope it carries to March
551 2019-02-04 19:48:26 I spent all my money on their cannabis, can afford stocks  !
552 2019-02-04 19:47:50 YES THANK YOU 
I stock cancelled on your bitch ass for a reason

Homie stocks in friendlies are way worse because it literally only shortens the time I can spend playing in that game
553 2019-02-04 19:47:31 Robo advisors give out generic advice. All the "how much you should allocate to stocks and bonds at diff. ages" is mostly bullshit.  The date you are going to withdraw $$ from your acct is far more important than your age. Longevity expectations matter. Where mkts are matters.
554 2019-02-04 19:47:11 Or would buy some dividend paying stocks that you roll back in to buy more in time you would hit a 7 rule and reach real money!

657 2019-02-04 19:08:36 They are not a typical mREIT. I've read your entire exchange with Div, SA too. The only concern I have is to make sure I'm not overweighted the sector. I would not own any other common REIT...only preferreds. Same with bank stocks. Everyone's risk tolerance is different.

662 2019-02-04 19:06:44 As far as I know, none of cannabis stocks are in Nasdaq 100 or S&P 100 where I am choosing my 10 stocks from.  If any of them are there, they didn't rank high enough for me to buy choose.
663 2019-02-04 19:05:01 Its a good question- I have had some pot stocks but they so overbought imo now that I do not want to be in them this year either. May just play it safe and stay in cash this year and wait for the #uranium juniors to fall some more. I already have $400k in uranium so all done now
664 2019-02-04 19:03:41 Nobody is denying those risks. Top shelf utilities I own pay 2.8 3%....I'm not dumping them to load up on 12% stocks. There's no inflation, ever 2% compounding inflation, protection.

685 2019-02-04 18:54:39 Why do stocks always float upwards on low vol, never down? A steady stream of price insensitive buyers.... I doubt it.
686 2019-02-04 18:54:28 I think you might be referring to our data that does that 82% of AIM stocks have an ave trade size <£10k and 35% of AIM is owned by retail

689 2019-02-04 18:52:20 $CRON today is all about marijuna stocks.  Candle for shorts after Friday did not conformed.  Options biggest flow is for 25 n then 30.  No more higher prices seeing base on flow.
690 2019-02-04 18:51:59 On the other hand, we are already in a new Bull Market with tremendous gains in leading stocks $KL $CRON $SCWX $EHTH to name a few.

The regulations are in-place to protect their industry, just as much as they are to protect fish stocks. But the problems are pollution creating hypoxic/anoxic zones.

716 2019-02-04 18:39:22 DM believes in "capitalism," which is where the FED bails out banks for the good of the Country. In that scenario recessions are never allowed--ever. Because stocks don't ever trade on fundamentals, they trade on magic dividend beans that offer 12% risk-less yields in 2% markets
717 2019-02-04 18:38:41 there just isn't $5tn sitting "locked up" in nostros. That is the flow THROUGH nostros, not what is IN them. They have misread flows as stocks.

727 2019-02-04 18:34:24 Twitter is so huge with so many people doing everything but for those why are thinking of their future you would be smart to go to your local brokerage company such as Scottrade in the USA and open a trading account and just buy and learn to sell the Mary Jane stocks.

806 2019-02-04 18:02:36 I'm looking for any financial or investment gurus in bim, especially in stocks and bonds. Anybody know of any?  Tag them or send me a link or something
807 2019-02-04 18:01:55 Are these traders buying the pot stocks with great vigor actually partaking of the lettuce at the same time they push the buy button?

No offense intended, I'm just asking.
808 2019-02-04 18:01:50 The other thing is that airline stocks have been trading stocks for a long time as they usually lost money, so no one cared. With the mergers you are seeing sustained profits now and maybe a new class of investors.

814 2019-02-04 17:59:52 To me this is what the issue is. Almond growers are eating into an already shrinking fluid milk market. Cheese stocks are huge. You can already see the cotton market looking over their shoulder at the proposed hemp fiber market. How do we all get along?
815 2019-02-04 17:59:42 Not sure I follow what you're saying.  Market looks forward, not back!  Powell has said he will do everything to keep stocks inflated.  Steady grind up to 3000 and then let's see.
816 2019-02-04 17:59:07 So his neutral is much better because he's safer on shield AND jumping is much less of a commitment, his advantage state is better because now he has a reliable grab in Buster (And buster is better in general), AND he can switch to Smash at any moment and steal stocks below 80%
817 2019-02-04 17:57:55 One point I was trying to make with my buy and hold strategy post was that when you hold a diverse portfolio of stocks, the risk of losing reduces as time goes on.

Appreciate your view as learning.
849 2019-02-04 17:45:13 Is it for everyone or only the super wealthy?

Will houses be on anything like an exchange and trade like stocks? Can i buy fractions of properties, can three friends and I all go in on a property?

Questions like this...i don't want to just buy a house, i want to invest

852 2019-02-04 17:43:22 "Value stocks outperform during bear markets" is something a  often, but it's false.  Value stocks are cheap for a reason (e.g. more uncertainty in the future cash flows) and they outperform for a reason (investors are compensated for the additional risk)... #StockMarket

859 2019-02-04 17:41:33 was a broker for years when brokers took penny stocks & saw ppl lose all their money on those positions more often than not. usually after that they complained about being done with the market.

861 2019-02-04 17:41:10 Thanks Sunil, sorry I don’t have any of your email I’d hence tweeting. But I have a query on the ‘mojo stocks’. Why certain stocks are bought and in few weeks gets sold and then bought again? Also why technical indicators (bearish/bullish)are factor for selling a stock 1/2
862 2019-02-04 17:39:52 Was not really comparing really point being of the biggest part of there business declines the the stock goes down just like apple and the iPhones decline hit there stocks hard
863 2019-02-04 17:39:27 Those are realistic numbers if you look back a few years. $4.40 was the June high.  Our corn stocks ahead should put a $4.40-4.60 on the board if we end up with/sub 1.4-1.5 ending stocks. Can't keep using more than we grow forever.
864 2019-02-04 17:39:08 I haven't mentioned this, but I could have done. Quotas are owned by a few families with a virtual monopoly meaning the main gain will be for them. Also it is possible, likely judging by pre EEC behaviour that UK fishing,unrestricted by EU environmental quotas will deplete stocks
865 2019-02-04 17:38:48 Just live a normal life while memorizing names of stocks with largest growth and come back and invest in them?

880 2019-02-04 17:34:42 So many stocks plunging 70-90% because of bad Promoters. It's not just past performance, valuations and future growth of the company should be taken into account when investing in a stock, but promoter's track record should also be checked. Be aware of fraud promoters' stocks.
881 2019-02-04 17:34:27 Let's make it fair game for all and stop all types of taxpayer subsidies for corporations, and we will have true capitalism and corporations can buy back stocks and pay dividends from their true profits and not from taxpayers money.

913 2019-02-04 17:26:40 Two stocks I am watching $SN and $AXSM for swings that is about it
914 2019-02-04 17:26:14 Consumption boost of 40,000 cr ? FIN Min itself estimated it to cost 18400cr. 
And last budget a Standard deduction of 40,000rs was given which cost govt a similiar amount. Is thr any boom visible this Fiscal in the stocks mentioned above ? 
915 2019-02-04 17:26:09 #Stocks rallied to close out the month on strong #corporate #earnings reports and on indications from the @federalreserve that they will pause future #interestrate hikes.
916 2019-02-04 17:25:38 I gave you all to see bottom weekly stocks. So you can add your favorites to your watchlist
917 2019-02-04 17:25:34 A lot of those people make most of their money by employing other millionaires to manage it. And they still get to keep 30% over 10 million. If they want to reinvest money in jobs and making risky investments that create new jobs great but a lot of that is going into stocks
918 2019-02-04 17:24:32 I suspect it’s a tad more complex than that Bryce, in very recent years as area closures and management measures have increased stocks appear to have decreased which is not quite as one might expect....although I suspect this is more due to natural cycles than anything else. 1/2
919 2019-02-04 17:24:31 Stocks in Canada are booming too. I'm tempted
920 2019-02-04 17:24:19 It's a joke if someone gives 200 target for this stock. 200 target means around 10000 cr market cap. Seriously how can people believe such a fairy tale. Best in granite stocks also don't get such value which this stock is getting now. Beware of the hype else it will be game over.
921 2019-02-04 17:23:40 $NVDA up 4.04%

940 2019-02-04 17:17:32 15 Marijuana Stocks Gained at Least 50% in January. And as I keep reminding y’all this industry is very much in its infancy and very speculative it still has profitability potential

942 2019-02-04 17:17:23 What the left doesn't understand is the difference between paper wealth verses real wealth. Paper worth is the value of assets, that if sold, would generate. That would cover real estate, stocks, bonds, etc.

946 2019-02-04 17:16:13 Hey it's TOS. I wanted to ask you, is there real time stock updates? The software was updating stocks every second so there were drops in amd that I didn't know about until late. Kinda weird.
947 2019-02-04 17:15:38 Does this apply to smash for the potential of losing any stocks?
No wonder Richter is an option
948 2019-02-04 17:15:01 Oilfield services all look similar.

950 2019-02-04 17:14:47 Here is my understanding -

All indexes constitutes of stocks & they collectively moves or balances the Index based on their individual strength/weakness. For example - #Nifty is made up of 50 stocks & based on the balance in these 50 Nifty moves. Its called Index Management.

962 2019-02-04 17:10:48 The Pepsi fan argued that aggressive stocks were too risky. In addition the pepsi fan was upset that I was not respecting the pepsi fan right to be upset.

974 2019-02-04 17:06:12 My stocks are doing great today. After being in the negative for a bit finally make some returns
975 2019-02-04 17:04:54 Homie stocks in friendlies are the #1 way to say "I care about stocks right now"
976 2019-02-04 17:04:25 She laughed at me after I mentioned that I was getting superbullish after a down day where all my stocks held their key levels.  Someone want to tell me how $COUP has performed since that point?
977 2019-02-04 17:04:19 One thing to remember is that bank stocks are a huge favourite of retail investors because of their high fully franked dividends.the rc and pressures to increase equity given the huge tbtf subsidy together with housing/china could mean dividend cuts and lower share prices
978 2019-02-04 17:03:48 just, the way shops work here is seriously pissing me off

every shop has the same fucking things and none stocks the stuff i actually need/if they do its expensive

this has been making me mad regarding many things but today is art shop edition
979 2019-02-04 17:03:40 So buy stocks and sell commodities...
980 2019-02-04 17:03:22 I never hold stocks beyond 10 days.. if I don't attain my price target within that range then I am sure I picked the wrong stock to begin with.
981 2019-02-04 17:01:54 well i think you better get used to it...i keep waiting for the transaction tax on stocks/vat tax/wealth tax/raising of ss cap tax...got to get the money from somewhere and you cant get it from people who dont have it    ok gym time   see ya

984 2019-02-04 16:59:30 All traders should sue them, sue the FED now is not possible to byu cheap stocks on pulback, everything is overvaluated. Investors cant buy becouse fundamentals are not there and there is no pissibility for pullback. Sick market. All investing proces menas nothing !
985 2019-02-04 16:59:15 turpentine stocks just shot up.
986 2019-02-04 16:59:04 If you're buying stocks purely on buybacks and PPT alone, just realize a slowing global economy will do massive damage to the general market structure.  Without a massive earnings growth expansion, valuations are very expensive here
987 2019-02-04 16:58:51 the growth in investments (real estate, art, stocks & bonds) is not taxed each year. Taxing this growth is only fair, as it is our economic framework that enables this growth.
988 2019-02-04 16:58:22 gotcha. I just know I didn't enjoy it. It's slower than Brawl with worst graphics and four stocks
989 2019-02-04 16:58:09 Why don't we start with "my super-yacht with a smaller yacht inside is full of priceless artwork that keeps getting damaged by all the flying champagne corks"? Personally I'd like to see a flat "execs make no more in salary/bonuses/stocks than 20x the lowest employee."
990 2019-02-04 16:58:02 Stocks...what to do?  The info is confusing so it may be best to stand aside.  Other than for employment, the economic news shows a weakening economy.  But Fed is scared and became very dovish.  Trends are turning positive.  I  have a small short position and may add to it soon
991 2019-02-04 16:57:41 Here's a hot take for y'all

"homie stocks" are one of the ultimate forms of disrespect
992 2019-02-04 16:57:28 Yall still not buying weed stocks??

995 2019-02-04 16:55:55 Agreed! 

I was scoffed at many a times whenever I bet on management in spec sector. I am yet to see a stock doing awesome in medium/longer term in spec sector / penny stocks without proper management. Retail investor has muddied view that “plans” can be executed when promised 
996 2019-02-04 16:54:10 Both my weed stocks are rising  
997 2019-02-04 16:53:55 @pavanztweetz can you DM me once bro, need small info on stocks stuff..
TIA
998 2019-02-04 16:53:06 Trump has more amo to lift up the stocks. (Trade deal and also another possible gov shurdown) and The market is on drugs after Feds comments where they dont care about any data good or bad. Too early to get short imho.

1000 2019-02-04 16:52:14 Overheard some person say, “I know the Lions bring me nothing but disappointment every year because they’re considered one of the laughing stocks of all major sports, but beating the Patriots made my year.” 

Wow.
1001 2019-02-04 16:51:52 “Birth Control isnt contraception indiscriminately.Means release & cultivation of better racial elements in society & gradual suppression,elimination & eventual extirpation of defective stocks-human weeds which threaten the blooming of the finest American flowers"

Who said it?
1002 2019-02-04 16:51:21 Sabi mo bigyan mo ko. Hahahaha.

Nagtatanong kung mag invest daw ako sa stocks hahahaha. Kaloka.
1003 2019-02-04 16:50:10 This is futile or redundant or both, because corporations might as well pay out more dividends and that is not better for workers who do not own capital or stocks.
1004 2019-02-04 16:50:07 mdrr ça tue!  elle m'avait donné des stocks de journalières pour 2 mois où j'avais rien payé ptdr

1006 2019-02-04 16:49:03 That is a good thing
Corporations pay as little as possible then when the corp makes cash it buys u its own stocks instead of paying more and charging less
1007 2019-02-04 16:46:58 Haddock stocks would seem to be at odds with your statement off the green list and vulnerable now.

My DM is open to followers who want to shoot me a line...though I don't buy/sell recommendations. I will share what I do.
1010 2019-02-04 16:46:18 Will avoid such stocks. Retail holding has increased by more than 80 lakh shares in 2 quarters. This gives an indication of what's happening.
1011 2019-02-04 16:46:17 We should see a huge pick up in the consumer this year as commodities are cheaper and wages rise due to less labor slack.  Capital will flow into stocks from around the world with a stronger dollar.  A mania is coming in 2019.  Just like 1999.  Oil will fall as the world slows.

If I have to pay tax on the arbitrary value of my home - a non-income producing asset - why can't the wealthy pay a tax on their wealth, much of which IS income producing (stocks & bonds plus other assets that appreciate, such as paintings, etc).
1026 2019-02-04 16:37:42 Can I spend it by investing it?  ima buy some stocks to make some more money (hopefully) 
1027 2019-02-04 16:37:42 Complete and utter nonsense! We’re seeing record stocks at the moment and anyway. Nobody is talking about increasing the quota against scientific advice. What we’re saying is not giving over 60% of that quota away to other countries!

1032 2019-02-04 16:36:17 @canyoncaplinger Who knows. Sometimes purchase is made to pump up stocks, other times it is fundamental changes on good things to come.
1033 2019-02-04 16:35:53 Fought a good Incineroar on Elite named DTFaux and when down 1-2 in game count with us both on 2 stocks in game 4, he just suddenly SD'd his stocks away and left. I really wanted to finish that set, it was fun and now I;m blue balled on how the set would have concluded.
1034 2019-02-04 16:35:17 The day is morphing in a risk-on thing for stocks.
1035 2019-02-04 16:35:02 Like 3 different weed stocks jumped like 6 percent or more I woke up to being up $5 for the day
1036 2019-02-04 16:34:06 The money goes not only to Americans but also to foreign holders of US equities. Why should the US Treasury subsidize foreign owners of US stocks?
1037 2019-02-04 16:33:46 @hussmanjp this POW rally has seen huge disproportion of $ gone into (tech) growth stocks, direct counter to thesis of global growth slowdown. how does that faith-based speculation fit within risk-aversion thesis?
1038 2019-02-04 16:33:44 I don’t know shit about stocks honestly. If I can bring in 20-50k a season I’m happy. This year is a little south of 50.

1045 2019-02-04 16:29:55 Bernie.....there you go assuming all stockholders are wealthy.  I am not wealthy, yet I own stocks in a variety of companies.  It's one of the things that makes capitalism work!  I bet YOU own stocks too.  Difference is you probably trade on insider information, and I don't
1046 2019-02-04 16:29:52 We "own you" in what? Delusional stocks?
1047 2019-02-04 16:29:38 And of course, the unwavering/undying Faith that the fed will always bid stocks Higher
1048 2019-02-04 16:28:57 Lol. Stocks are shares in a companies ownership, clues in the name. A loan is something totally  different, it has to been paid back usually over fixed period with interest. You really are clueless.
1049 2019-02-04 16:28:57 $roku is just where it's at!! Hope y'all are listening and buying AND MAKING TONS OV $$$$$

1053 2019-02-04 16:26:46 On the pot stocks, do we wait for a small pullback or join now?
1054 2019-02-04 16:26:35 Hummm and who get credit for the stocks going down?
1055 2019-02-04 16:26:12 Except they didn’t. The tax cuts resulted in them investing the money in buying back stocks which is great for shareholders but not so great for middle and lower class.
1056 2019-02-04 16:25:18 I like to hear thoughts of other people on stocks I own. Sometimes there are things I have overlooked or haven't considered properly.
1057 2019-02-04 16:25:05 I like all of the above, but these stocks can move pretty fast, if you're looking safer alternatives ie in terms of risk/reward you might consider these as well:
$CRM $VMW and $ADBE 
And if you're looking for one that is a catch-up trade in the software industry, try:

1060 2019-02-04 16:23:48 @1a Congressmen legally trade stocks with insider information. After leaving  office government officials accept lucrative speaking engagements, book  deals, trips, etc. I find it disingenuous that they wish to prevent  Trump from profiting.
1061 2019-02-04 16:23:33 I think you’re giving them too much credit. There’s a reason stocks are up 7 straight weeks but I haven’t figured it out yet.

1065 2019-02-04 16:20:39 You stand for Trump’s ban and confiscation of bump stocks from 400,000 responsible law abiding citizens who did nothing wrong. Many of whom *were* NRA members!
1066 2019-02-04 16:20:32 Bonds are moving worse again today. The good news is that they are resting on a pretty strong level of support now, at the bottom of our recent trading range. It is a very light week for economic reports, so likely movement in the bond will come down to a tug of war with stocks.

1127 2019-02-04 15:51:07 Nephew asked me how to start investing/trading.

I stand firm on this advice.

Start buying stocks of companies or things you like or use. If you don't know who makes it, take time to look into it (now they learn how research)

This, is the K.I.S.S method.

1179 2019-02-04 15:34:48 I watched them out of the window the other day, didn’t even knock at the door, just chucked it on the door step and text me to say it had been left in a safe place  unbelievable
1180 2019-02-04 15:34:42 U.S. stocks and bonds are rallying together, an atypical pattern that some investors worry suggests the January rebound in equities is fated to run up against a painful reversal.

1197 2019-02-04 15:30:15 Really? The Justice dept under Trump reclassified bump stocks as a "machine gun part" under the National Firearms Act of 1934. Any machine guns or machine gun parts made after May 19th, 1986 under the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986 are prohibited for sale to civilians.

1232 2019-02-04 15:16:14 If valuation (P/E ratio) matters so much, why have growth stocks CRUSHED value the last decade? People buying growth don't bat an eye at the multiples and they keep on winning. I know, I know, reversion to the mean (value outperforms). BUT WHEN?!

1266 2019-02-04 15:01:47 The above is true if you’re looking to allocate to a company long-term and not participate in the buybacks (i.e. be a seller). But the easy way to avoid this is simply to not own expensive stocks irrespective of if they buyback stock or not. If they do, liquidity to get out.

1277 2019-02-04 14:57:51 I think Fed is at point where they're going to do everything to save stocks, even if they have to destroy long term economic prospects.  It's going to be 2 steps forward one step back until we hit 3000 on SPX in a few weeks/months, then maybe some action.

1279 2019-02-04 14:57:37 I think CPP uses about 6%. US Social Security uses a bond yield because that's what's in the fund. If SS moved to stocks, the SSA actuaries would raise the discount rate, but the Congressional Budget Office's economists would probably stick with the bond yield.

May I remind the world that if a person was to know of a 500 point drop in the DOW stocks and the time gerneraly of the rebound that they could easily make a 30 percent one time profit.  May I also point out that our markets have repeatedly dropped and jumped.

1301 2019-02-04 14:50:44 The stock market not a good indicator of a profitable company. Evey ecoonimist knows this. Stocks speculate the company's profit value. A real profitable company is people, buying what they sell. People arent buying because they have little disposable  income. So pay better wage

1312 2019-02-04 14:45:04 I changed the stocks app on my phone to reflect percentages rather than points about a week ago. It causes a huge difference in emotional reaction to market movement (for the better). I like it.
1313 2019-02-04 14:44:53 They literally do cost evaluations when something becomes critical. Is it more profitable to stop operations to fix it, extending it's life, OR, buy small cleaning companies, and stocks in them, let the rig fail catastrophically, then profit from the cleanup.. Evil fuckers.

1317 2019-02-04 14:44:16 "First, stock buybacks don’t benefit the vast majority of Americans. That’s because large stockholders tend to be wealthier. Nearly 85 percent of all stocks owned by Americans belong to the wealthiest 10 percent of households."

1346 2019-02-04 14:33:31 How do the consumers win in this one when this is going to close down any competition to the Big 4 Banks hence why there stocks have risen in the stock market.

1373 2019-02-04 14:18:32 Viewpoint - yes, I’m long Stocks. Will this year be bumpy? I think so, but it wouldn’t take much to settle issues and send the DJIA soaring. Hedge funds are buying but selectively. Equities remain in favor. I am looking at bargains too, as I follow the “Big Dogs”.

1379 2019-02-04 14:15:01 Definitely not too late to the game. I am not even sure I owned dividend stocks when I was 33! Slow and steady is the way to go. My dividend income was up 88% from previous year just by investing differently. There is hope:)

1401 2019-02-04 14:02:26 I'm not sure you'll get bipartisan buy in for wealth caps and appropriation. A VAT or consumption tax will disproportionately pull more income from the wealthy based on voluntary consumption patterns as well as from the corporations whose stocks they also own.
1402 2019-02-04 14:01:43 I disagree. Our total revenue from fishing is a shade less than £1bn including local sales and 2/3 of our stocks are plundered elsewhere. Our fishing industry isn't viable on a large scale under those rules. Control of our stocks free of CFP allows us to act outside like Norway.

1419 2019-02-04 13:47:59 Absolutely. That is the main reason I dislike the term. In finance your stocks or shares will very likely have value years later. In a football game you get 90 minutes and have to hope the price swings your way.

1424 2019-02-04 13:42:24 I'm not talking about what led to the decline I'm talking about us having an EEZ as large & fruitful as Norway with only 1/5 of revenue. We only land 1/3 of our own fish. The difference is £4bn just in stocks. The potential maritime trade economy is way beyond that.

1454 2019-02-04 13:22:35 looks like another very good day on Wall St. Stocks are poised to continue their upward swing as more earnings reports come in today.  tech and communication stocks should be the primary focus as they will be leading the pack today and this week in general.
1455 2019-02-04 13:22:06 Bank stocks already have had a 10% reduction, you will likely see further erosion. Unlikely mortgage arrears will even double from today's very low point. Canada's banks are super diversified. So a 50% short is going to get very expensive.

1539 2019-02-04 12:13:24 Bull markets make stocks expensive, expensive stocks leave little room for error, and this increases the odds of bull markets ending. Same in the other direction. Recessions cause pessimism. Pessimism causes underproduction which leads to scarcity which leads to a new boom.

1557 2019-02-04 11:51:39 Oops, I didn't know that, thanks for correcting me. It's certainly half at some companies, I believe Volkswagen for instance, but maybe that has to do with the fact that the state of Niedersachsen own part of the stocks. And the coal industry

I guess then my policy goal is 50%
1558 2019-02-04 11:51:08 #America there are three facts. The #aoc idea means YOU have only 30% of your income to use. Stocks fuel your pensions, 401K, and success is not a crime. As everyone prospers, these current #progressive ideas are on the #wrong side of history. Let’s be smarter and focus on facts
1559 2019-02-04 11:48:12 @SenSanders @chuckschumer where do you think increases of stocks go? This is a democracy, not Russia. Worker 401Ks are made primarily of stock?. How ignorant are you about America? #socialist #democrats need to research first
1560 2019-02-04 11:46:37 earnings haven't mattered since fin crisis nor now - at least yet. outside of a very few commentators, everyone else says fed and CB can keep stocks going even while countries are in/near recessions, they offer the worst commentary heard in decades and most guide 2019 lower.

1580 2019-02-04 11:29:13 The problem is the lack of a consistent fact base and the many different ways in which the numbers are being communicated. you say apples, someone else says pears, the two don't correlate.

1835 2019-02-04 07:15:59 I am a student of data.  2018 was an "intersection" year for capital flows.  The volatility came from foreign investors choosing stocks couple of months then bonds.

5. Businesses with poor ROIC.

2085 2019-02-04 03:14:37 Yeah it took forever to kill and rage made it where people ended up just being kinda equal in percents the whole time

Almost all matches always came down to who got the last big hit

2149 2019-02-04 02:24:45 U.S. stocks eked out a small gain as a better-than-expected jobs report and signs of progress in trade talks overshadowed a disappointing sales forecast from Amazon.

The yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 2.69 percent after rising five basis points Friday.
2150 2019-02-04 02:24:41 Solid!
2151 2019-02-04 02:24:40 Should have Infinite stocks ^^
2152 2019-02-04 02:24:34 Disinflation since 2017 or 18. Also QT, global slowdown, interest rates up and US Treasury issuing record high new bonds to cover deficit = shift money from higher risk assets (stocks) to low risk assets (bonds )
2153 2019-02-04 02:24:19 Japanese stocks climbed, partly buoyed by a weaker yen, which held  losses from Friday after a better-than-expected U.S. jobs report. Australian stocks also advanced and futures tipped shares to rise in Hong Kong.
2154 2019-02-04 02:24:13 Asian stocks started the week with modest gains following strong U.S. economic data and positive comments out of Washington on the trade talks.

2168 2019-02-04 02:02:31 Primarily: Moving money between different stocks/investment types incurs fees. Selling them incurs taxes. If you're not likely* to get better returns with your money in another place, you should hold.

2181 2019-02-04 01:53:03 This is scary. Considering last pig yr was 2008. But excellent points to end saying the strong sectors. Alternate energy, mining and cannabis stocks are in longer term stocks. Thanks for this...

2185 2019-02-04 01:49:40 it's crazy, honestly a big reason in why i'm so against using her in this game is she feels so much worse at ending stocks at high percents compared to smash 4.
2186 2019-02-04 01:49:08 I think I have enough proof, and I already contacted the seller, so... guess who ordered an onhand LS and was sent a used LS?

2187 2019-02-04 01:48:22 My colleague @bartosiastics runs Zacks Surprise Trader. It buys stocks just before they report earnings. It's a lot of fun. You need a strong stomach to jump in right before.

2194 2019-02-04 01:41:43 Is it reliable though?  Are those who earn good $$ more willing to respond?  We know the majority of traders/investors in penny stocks lose so I'd think 40% is too high myself, although I guess after the past year, there's probably a lot of unsuccessful traders disappeared

2196 2019-02-04 01:39:34 Rate cuts are the most bearish event for stocks... You know why? Because it tells the market to get away from stocks and move to bonds, so the capital outflow is HUGE...
2197 2019-02-04 01:39:11 I used  to work for global company that they bought out! They moved some of our jobs related to Latin America to Colombia bc they can hire 3-1 American worker ! Their stocks have been falling  ever since

2201 2019-02-04 01:34:57 I think CRON is a touch overvalued at this point as well. A good short attack could drop it to $20 cad. pretty fast, only to launch right back. Most undervalued stocks right now are ACB and FIRE, IMHO.

2216 2019-02-04 01:24:23 I thought a few years ago that lithium would be an excellent investment and it was for a while but all those stocks now have come down.  Maybe battery technology is changing, I’m not sure, but I would think there would be a good investment in there somewhere.
