32 2018-03-20 21:58:54 Imagine being as old as @jpodhoretz and not realizing that child / young adult entertainers are treated like commodities and under amazing amounts of external pressure throughout their careers.
But he still takes the time to check her out on a regular basis?
33 2018-03-20 21:58:07 Slow down folks! Uk farmers are brilliant at producing commodities at world prices, supported by CAP. We now need to produce higher value food on improved soils and not damage and improve the environment whilst doing it. We will be brilliant at this too.
34 2018-03-20 21:51:55 Why are you putting farmers livelihoods at risk by trashing NAFTA or imposing tariffs when counties will retaliate by imposing them on commodities (that means crops, dumb Donald)?
35 2018-03-20 21:50:50 Happy #NationalAgDay Michigan is 2nd in being diverse in Ag commodities in all 50 states. Over 300 different commodities produces $101 billion annually in our states economy. Proud to be from MI and proud to be the future of agriculture.
36 2018-03-20 21:46:41 Why is this a surprise to anyone?  The entire raison d etre and the reason Crypto currency has any value whatsoever, is to allow Wall Street bankers to trade on illegal commodities, including child porn, with plausible deniability.
37 2018-03-20 21:42:20 Let's extend the "follow the money" dictum to FOLLOW THE DATA.

One of the most prized commodities in the currency of the Information Age is data -your data.

I'll bet the targeted disinformation pushed by Russian Bots was weaponized by the 50 M user breach of Cambridge Analytica

40 2018-03-20 21:28:14 “Your leader just said they own a lot of XRP so I don't see how you call it fairly distributed!”

The people who produced the commodities get to decide on how to distribute them. 
Why on earth do you think you should have a say?
41 2018-03-20 21:20:28 In the future, the history books will describe crypto-currency as a phase of transacting commodities where some people got rich and some people got robbed.

They’ll say the same about oil.

45 2018-03-20 20:35:29 Pre financial collapse, everyone including Gartman seemed to be pushing buying farmlands and commodities (ouch on ur foot) as China would need proteins, etc. Wha happened? I wondered how China built the Great Wall over centuries ago without protein?
46 2018-03-20 20:22:08 Vamo' arriba! Hay que sacarlos como sea! Mientras tuvieron los precios de los commodities altos la llevaron canchereando con los números macro. Se les terminó el recreo y los números no cierran por ningún lado ahora.
47 2018-03-20 20:20:14 California’s agricultural abundance includes more than 400 commodities and distributes more than 90 percent of produce all over the nation. 

Happy #NationalAGDay..... Yea!


48 2018-03-20 20:08:02 Again...did I ever say it isn't legal to own one? I'm cool with people owning AR-15s legally. My question is whether it is smart to mass manufacture them as, if you know anything about commodities of scale, the more there are available the more chance a bad guy can get one.
49 2018-03-20 20:03:02 Why? Always thought that a country can decide by herself how to handle their commodities. Contract with  ends next year, so  is allowed to do whatever it wants to do with its gas as long as they fulfil contracts with other customers, right?

51 2018-03-20 19:48:20 @aelfblockchain OTC commodities: in liquid sectors, be sure to prorate them.
52 2018-03-20 19:45:54 Please, enlighten me. Do you realize how much of our commodities China & Mexico alone import?
53 2018-03-20 19:42:45 How's about adding some cross-IP rare commodities into each others' games to pirate?
54 2018-03-20 19:41:00 Standardized debt tranches: in the commodities sector, plan to collateralize them.
55 2018-03-20 19:40:09 The reverse would mean an increase in prices of commodities and that's one of the worst things that can happen to us rn (^inflation) even the poorest would feel the impact. Finding a balance with these variables to benefit all is one tough thing I've come to realize.
56 2018-03-20 19:31:22 @aelfblockchain Senior-rated commodities: in subordinate-rated markets, plan to prepay them.

58 2018-03-20 19:30:29 The government is so corrupt. Oppressing the very wanjiku that it should offer salvation to. People siphoning public money and passing bills to increase price for common commodities like fuel and electricity. Yet their salaries keep increasing while they tax us more
59 2018-03-20 19:22:41 The fact that commodities are purchased in advance means we have not seen the full impact of the collapse of the £ yet.
60 2018-03-20 19:21:42 Subprime commodities: in the South African market, plan to leverage them.
61 2018-03-20 19:20:20 I usually go to my son (commodities trader) with these very elementary questions. Thanks for responding.
62 2018-03-20 19:11:00 To believe other peoples money is for you to spend on commodities is to not believe in property. Its theft and it breeds a culture of lazy people who look for handouts.

87 2018-03-20 17:42:13 Unlike commodities, the production cost of bitcoin is not dependent on labour & equipment costs, but on the value of the commodity itself.

101 2018-03-20 16:38:51 Agreed on everything. I am not a fan of Albert Pike. He is one of the sources of this mentality that we are all commodities. He excludes himself and the others like him from that though. I'm just sharing him to study, not emulate.

115 2018-03-20 16:16:01 I truly do not understand this logic. Desire? Yes. Need? Yes. Owe??? People owe you money; a commodity. People aren’t commodities.

118 2018-03-20 16:04:03 Not what I said. Here I am on twitter, right? Point is social media is many things, none of them necessary to individual or communal survival or success.  These platforms and the data they generate are inessential commodities. Ubiquity and neccesity are not the same things.
119 2018-03-20 16:03:29 A mayor demanda, mayor precio

O viceversa.

En commodities frecuentemente se dan correlaciones positivas.
120 2018-03-20 16:00:30 And I thought we might at least be more valuable than cheese! This just about sums up how people are valued in this day and age!  Sad but true.  We're way down on the list of valuable commodities! 
121 2018-03-20 15:59:49 2 of the biggest commodities for the next few decades will be personal data and as a result,  privacy.
That play was clear decades ago.
I personally don't exist on any sm platform.
I don't take pictures. I don't do surveys. I don't support NIDS in its current form.
122 2018-03-20 15:59:47 According to Magazine, men’s consumption of women saw: women are exchanged as commodities with use values such as sex and child bearing - again such a generalized, old-fashioned assumption. Women can be what and who they want, whether with a male partner or a female. #SocialGeo
123 2018-03-20 15:55:34 Your issues with trade deals and proposed tariffs have significantly hurt our farmers. Countries are turning away from US farmers to purchase commodities, destroying their livelihoods. And your disbelief about #ClimateChange hurts their futures even more. #LiarInChief

126 2018-03-20 15:54:22 And that's why China switched to Brazil and Mexico for commodities #NationalAgricultureDay # tariffs
127 2018-03-20 15:53:18 Our humour is a huge difference maker......together with our common sense and awareness that right & wrong are tangible commodities that shouldn't be disregarded as we wander these paths to whatever 'end' awaits us!!!!!
128 2018-03-20 15:51:23 When Bourgeois calls genius, truth, life, beauty, expression, etc. it is always a bazaaru thing, a commodity. Bazzar people are jurist, they have final word on everything, they give licence to these commodities and then exploit it.
129 2018-03-20 15:46:08 I hope they don't get killed by the looming trade war. We export a lot of agricultural commodities. (You don't see our customers complaining, like you complain about the horrific thought of buying other country's goods).

144 2018-03-20 14:51:49 Yes, it was always wrong to assume competitive labor markets. Labor is not like other commodities, and  one need not believe in surplus value to believe that. It used to be a common, if not majority, view.

241 2018-03-20 07:54:55 No model of risk. Do commodities have a life, does there life change value. Contractual agreements with labour or is all labour the same?

249 2018-03-20 07:23:42 Why do prices of commodities change?
Because the value of Money, is variable.
Why?
Because, they control the stock & own the Gold.

258 2018-03-20 06:44:42 Sure it wasn't, with all the commodities it was making in factories where profit was centralised in a small handful of bosses, and then selling on the international market for profit. 

Not capitalist.
259 2018-03-20 06:17:53 you REALLY believe they can not be sacrificed? ... REALLY?

you need to waken up and smell the coffee hen.

The Tories don't give a XXXX about Farming or Fishing they are just commodities that they will use for their own ends and to hell with the farmers and fishermen
260 2018-03-20 06:15:51 Classifying cryptocurrencies as commodities or assets is what we don’t want, and it’s ridiculous anyhow. If they could be regulated as currencies, fine.
261 2018-03-20 05:57:25 I dunno. This and maybe chill ICE out before they ruin the 2018 construction season, too? Hard to sell commodities when nobody is around to do the work.
262 2018-03-20 05:53:21 I’ve been so into crypto currency I totally forgot their was Commodities
263 2018-03-20 05:32:05 I agree with point 4 - we even see e-commerce giants like Amazon setting up physical retail stores for commodities such as groceries and greens.

265 2018-03-20 05:30:11 Qué pasa si tengo un activo con baja rotación y más costos de inventario sobre pasa el costo de oportunidad y lo decido liquidar? No voy a poder vender. No me quiero imaginar esto con los nuevos productos financieros o commodities donde el precio fluctua.?
266 2018-03-20 05:24:02 @TuckerCarlson Last segment @ cigars:     Obama pulling a Soros stunt. Bring down commodities to very low price or almost destroy them. Buy out industry at rock bottom. Then bring back. Obama’s foundation head in charge of scheme.
267 2018-03-20 05:19:23 These aren't homes anymore. They're shares in the Vancouver stock market. Commodities to be bought and sold; not for living. Take 'shelter' off the 'necessity of life' list. It is not respected in this city.
268 2018-03-20 05:18:05 Pero cómo hacemos para lograr ese cambio económico en esta crisis de commodities que ya nos está llegando?
269 2018-03-20 05:01:27 What is social justice? Giving everyone freedom or government grabbing everything, wasting at least half, then trickling down equal commodities to all regardless of sloth or hardwork (cept for the elite politburo types)? Can U have both freedom & equality?
270 2018-03-20 05:00:54 They are taking quick turn around loads, easy hauling, high margin commodities beacause grain will still be there when they get around to it. Paying more for better service would be reasonable if we knew the charge for the service wasn't already too high. We need costing review
271 2018-03-20 05:00:44 I don't always agree with you, but you're bang on here. We are a trading nation. Vancouver is our largest and busiest port. Of course it should move one of our most plentiful commodities. For Wash to step in and shame us on oil transport is a friggin joke.

273 2018-03-20 04:53:19 but the idea the effort in social relations creates use-value is wrongheaded. or perhaps we might reverse that and say the reification of social relationships into commodities is a negative liberal development

283 2018-03-20 03:35:38 @BNN #commodities funny the one thing you never reported on in regard to the #KinderMorganPipeline protest is that most all of the protesters were shipped in from across the border in Washington State and we're not even Canadian. Funny how you would miss such an important detail.

292 2018-03-20 02:40:11 Yah for sure this latest crisis was paled in comparison to 1981-82, which remains the worst since the 1930s for Canadian workers.

293 2018-03-20 02:21:39 Before every elections, we see people like @sherryontopp r traded as commodities.

298 2018-03-20 02:06:07 I think if we're focused on individuals instead of ideas then we are busy being being distracted while we're being extracted. Our wealth, our finite healthy years we can invest in working for a living, these are commodities to people/corporations who only think of profits.

302 2018-03-20 01:47:42 Also I never understand the various commodities people lump golf in with.  People treat golf like it’s a couch on Craigslist, all they want to do is haggle and make sure you know how much of a favor they’re doing you by giving you their business.
303 2018-03-20 01:43:40 It is notional value, and I used to scoff when the exchange used notional value to impress the uninitiated. Having been in commodities, which is much more oversight than financial derivatives, we'll never know. Then again I have a bias against cash settled contracts.
304 2018-03-20 01:40:45 Having been in commodities, which are much more controlled than financial futures, you know what leverage can do.
305 2018-03-20 01:40:23 I find the comparison to assets such as gold and other commodities much more interesting. If you believe in the store of value trait of Bitcoin, it still has a long way to go.

As for the whole token economy implication altcoins provide... Not sure if it will hold up. Maybe.
306 2018-03-20 01:34:13 Yes & Europeans enslaved Africans on a far larger scale than Arabs did, & it was Europeans that made Africans into the first commodities of capital which became the starting point of capitalism. This is the basis of the colonial oppression that we see all over the world
307 2018-03-20 01:30:52 Because if you remove wine and alcohol driven tourism Napa will thrive on all it's OTHER commodities.
308 2018-03-20 01:23:08 People who frame relationships as transactional and based on the relative value of personal commodities are so weird to me.
309 2018-03-20 01:13:04 Commodities tend to zig, when the equity markets zag.
310 2018-03-20 00:55:12 Knowing facts in their opacity as objective illusions (commodities, identity, market) doesn't translate into a subjective ability to directly alter them. It requires a notion of the subject as simultaneously subjected to power & subject of power (see Judith Butler & also others)

313 2018-03-20 00:44:08 because the $ is the currency in which most commodities oil etc are priced & those affect the cost of living & inflation the most
314 2018-03-20 00:40:05 One thing is VERY plain from this whole #CambridgeAnalytica thing... The law (inc OFFENCES, sentences & investigatory powers) is TOTALLY out of date. Data is now one of the most valuable commodities on the planet but the law doesn't protect it like £££, gold & diamonds!
315 2018-03-20 00:38:41 Some of the commodities we’re competing with are price takers too: oil, lumber, fertilizer. They’re just willing to pay to get priority. Why should farmers expect rail companies to move grain when they can make more money elsewhere?
316 2018-03-20 00:37:06 BitNautic acts as a market for goods and commodities where importers, exporters, end-consumers and producers are available to trade their products. and facilitate their trading practices around the world #bitnautic
317 2018-03-20 00:35:41 There’s no such thing as an anarchist market because the process of exchanging commodities produced through labor necessitates a socioeconomic hierarchy of some laborers over others
318 2018-03-20 00:34:08 thanks for play-by-play. Some on the coast are seeing an improvement for grain but not other bulk commodities or intermodal
