6 2018-07-24 23:58:56 Don't understand how any sensible business owner can ignore climate change. It's not political issue, it's Mother Nature, who doesn't care whom you vote for. Risk management is key factor in biz success. I'm sure big oil is doing what they can to plan for it even while denying.

10 2018-07-24 23:58:21 Wait, a vegan who doesn’t eat salads? (No judgement, I was a ‘vegan’ for three years. I still ate cheese. I just never told anyone about it. )

Do you just use oil in place of butter for shortcrust?
11 2018-07-24 23:58:07 And trump wants to release federal oil reserves to help keep gas prices down until election day.

13 2018-07-24 23:57:37 Nice! I’m also looking forward to using less oil, and I’ve been having fun changing how we cook things. 
14 2018-07-24 23:57:34 Sanctions against a criminal entity do not.
Iranians   despite 40 yrs of sanctions & propaganda.
The mullahs will most definitely surrender, which is what Iranians want so that the oil $ is spent in Iran, not for killing ppl abroad; if mullahs fall, even better.
15 2018-07-24 23:57:29 Why is #welfare ok for farmers, and coal and oil companies but not the poor, elderly, or homeless vets?
16 2018-07-24 23:57:14 No drilling in Alaska.   Look what happened oil spill in Mississippi    and I think Louisiana.
17 2018-07-24 23:57:05 Apparently life wanted me to have an adventure and find a new place to get my oil changed in my car. So a popped tire ain't all bad.

38 2018-07-24 23:56:54 Personally I prefer to heat the oil to an irresponsibly high temperature and get it done quickly that way, but I guess that way is also good if you don't want your house to burn down

47 2018-07-24 23:55:11 Here in Pennsylvania #Democrats are running on taxing oil developers working in the state. Do they think we have forgotten? In 2016 drilling was completely stopped and thousands of jobs disappeared. All it took was the threat of the taxes #Democrats want to impose. #JobKillers

50 2018-07-24 23:54:57 I like that some LPs offer oil softgels.  I wish an oil was available for vaping.  Terpenes are important and hate when some oil products are striped of them.
51 2018-07-24 23:54:31 did someonefucking replace my rum with olive oil im about to throw hands
52 2018-07-24 23:54:23 I just changed my oil, oil filter, fuel filter, engine hoses, and thermostat somebody give me an award
53 2018-07-24 23:54:04 I found the sweetest post on facebook today that shared what "He anoints my head with oil" in Psalm 23. sheep get awful insects that lay eggs in their noses and turn into worms, causing them to go crazy and bash their head against rocks, sometimes until death.
54 2018-07-24 23:53:59 Me, watching oil splatter all over my recently mopped floors: being an adult sucks bc I wouldn't have cared about this before
55 2018-07-24 23:53:56 In Pres Trump’s book ‘Time to Get Tough’ he says 1 of the smartest in the debate on OPEC is this senator / I recently intro’d NOPEC legis to fight against the oil cartel’s unfair practices & stranglehold on intl oil trade @realDonaldTrump says “It’s time to get it passed” I AGREE
56 2018-07-24 23:53:54 Time to go through my drawings, paintings, sketches, art kits, paints, pencils, oil pastels, brushes, watercolors, the list never stops X'D

This is gonna take me 10 hours.....

But I am ready for the pain that ensues

59 2018-07-24 23:53:40 Butter, bacon fat, and oil are all essential for frying, plus butter for baking & putting on your biscuits & cornbread. It's just a fact of life. 
60 2018-07-24 23:53:37 when i first started dating my boyfriend i really wanted to know if he was a virgin so i pointed at a bottle of extra virgin olive oil and said "me"
61 2018-07-24 23:53:27 I don’t think Friedman predicted mispricing the CPI, having an oil supply shock, high war spending in Vietnam and COLA contracts being mispriced all occurring at the same time
62 2018-07-24 23:53:21 I recommend middle office to people who aren't straight out of school. Strategic planning, risk management, operations, all pay pretty well with good perks. Alternatively if you have another expertise like you worked in Oil&Gas or Biomed, you could push into specialized banking
63 2018-07-24 23:52:47 Fake news CNN has a series about why it is bad to tap the Alaskan pipeline! If we would have listened to Reagan in 1980, we would be self reliant and not need Iran, Russia and Venezuela for oil. Yesterday Iran threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz stopping oil from going thru!
64 2018-07-24 23:52:44 The hope is a full out cross Canada carbon tax. Yet Canada kisses republican USA butt crack. Pipelines oil insanity.
65 2018-07-24 23:52:04 Someone once said to me, don't you remember rationing? But I don't. I just remember our Co-op number. (1652) I was less than 8 months old when rationing ended completely. I doubt if I had a ration card. (I did have cod-liver-oil and orange juice though.)
66 2018-07-24 23:52:01 Lol! Heavily invested in the oil industry... This is gonna be great! Pass the popcorn!
67 2018-07-24 23:51:58 Every Dem scheme reeks of snake oil salesman anymore.
68 2018-07-24 23:51:52 There's no mineral money in that story, is there? Those politicians only care about big oil money.
69 2018-07-24 23:51:52 Dinner tonight requires something I loath....Deep frying. I can't stand the oil. I can't stand the smell. I can't stand the smoke if you let it burn. The smell, though. It seems like it clings to everything for days. We're making a quicker version of Chicken Karaage.
70 2018-07-24 23:51:49 I couldn't be in why lol its a oil paint not photo im not good at self portriats yet been working on it

72 2018-07-24 23:51:35 I need some more wild growth oil
73 2018-07-24 23:51:27 You can't get to the coconut water without BREAKING it. You can't get the olive oil without CRUSHING it. You can't get harvest without DESTROYING it. You can't get the diamonds without the PRESSURE. Glory to God in my DARKNESS & SUFFERING. For even in CHAOS I find COMFORT.
74 2018-07-24 23:51:24 Call it what it is: a BAILOUT. Something his republicans competely oppose unles of course it's for them, the big financials, energy cos. (coal, oil, gas) After all where did most of his inept cabinet hail from? Except most inept who came from congress, they won't steal their rich

101 2018-07-24 23:49:40 Just watched the first episode. Has a Homeland flavor to it. Interesting subject; the inefficiency of alternative energy makes it plausible. As much as people cry about oil, we really don't have any alternative. I'm wondering if that's where they're going with this.

109 2018-07-24 23:48:57 I suspect Ken Calvert is in so deep with murky oil companies that he can't see his way out. His record is an indication of his stance on climate change. Remember to always note what is done rather than what's said.

Science and evidence is overwhelming

Scientist used to be unanimous, but oil & gas companies bought a couple - so of the “experts” the ratio is 1349 to 1 in agreement
It is unanimous upon scientists not contracted by oil & gas companies or contracted by Koch “think-tanks”

126 2018-07-24 23:46:07 It's cucumber, tomatoe, green pepper, yellow pepper, red onion, cayenne pepper(chilli is life), olive oil, garlic, cream cheese, beef strips (meat is the sterring  so like a double portion), chia seeds, a tiny bit of lettuce and a sprinkle of love !
127 2018-07-24 23:45:46 No, but the previous oil crisis had a “persistent economic effect” that wasnt put right until the early 1980s.  So it wasn’t Thatcher who fixed anything: she just benefited from the global recovery of the two oil crises that caused all the problems of the 1970s.

136 2018-07-24 23:45:06 maybe we should continue working on improving fuel efficiency and public transportation instead of artificially suppressing oil prices when we need to do EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO PERMANENTLY MOVE AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS FOREVER just my 2 ¢
137 2018-07-24 23:45:05 Account balance is probably on nil waiting for the next wash, dry & oil experience 
138 2018-07-24 23:45:05 The GOP doesn't have to settle for a morally (and at times financially) bankrupt snake oil salesman.
But so many have embraced him and they are seemingly oblivious ti the fact he is dragging the party down with him.

142 2018-07-24 23:44:22 My hair loves olive oil but only the extra virgin kind
143 2018-07-24 23:44:07 After 22 years I finally learned how to check the oil in my car, put a battery on it, and how to use a socket wrench. #AdultingToday
144 2018-07-24 23:44:02 Pandering is not policy. But keep pitching that snake oil...

147 2018-07-24 23:43:03 me: *clicks on skincare video*

person in vid: “ya so first i use this clean and clear foaming wash and then slather on coconut oil” 

me: *clicks out and throws ipad out the window*
148 2018-07-24 23:43:01 yessss the best oils so moisturizing the other oils especially olive oil is drying to my hair
149 2018-07-24 23:42:59 Apparently no one at any other manufacturer donated money to political campaigns. Nor any of the oil companies. Only @elonmusk did. Otherwise that would have been in the news too..... Right?...... right?....
150 2018-07-24 23:42:31 Maybe we'll hit peak oil at the same time.  Lol
151 2018-07-24 23:42:27 Washed my hair now I put a hot oil treatment in it waiting to wash it out so I can use my hydrating shampoo to hydrate my hair 
152 2018-07-24 23:42:24 @Petedavis1 I called earlier about never using synthetic oil in my cars an you were about to say something but your WONDERFUL phone system cut me off.
153 2018-07-24 23:42:09 moira and i have started making soap and its very fun except when you spill your fragrance oil. good news is now my house is gonna smell like froot loops for the next 3 months
154 2018-07-24 23:42:09 Baby shampoo + a lil olive oil + a brush cleaning mat
155 2018-07-24 23:42:04 灰皿にコーヒー注いでしまった
156 2018-07-24 23:42:02 Fletch: Awww, come on guys, it's so simple maybe you need a refresher course. Hey! It's all ball bearings nowadays. Now you prepare that Fetzer valve with some 3-in-1 oil and some gauze pads, and I'm gonna need 'bout ten quarts of anti-freeze, preferably Prestone.
157 2018-07-24 23:41:54 I think THC is a compound vs an actual chemical. But..carcinogens are a real thing and another reason why I rather do oil vs burning the flower itself.
158 2018-07-24 23:41:53 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
159 2018-07-24 23:41:47 They did all of that under #Obama's "more flexible after the election" Administration. Now #Trump is building up #NATA, increasing oil and gas production and funding Ukraine.
160 2018-07-24 23:41:40 Loool don't worry about the sesame oil
161 2018-07-24 23:41:31 Almond oil is so underrated. I use it for everything.
162 2018-07-24 23:41:27 I need to make $30 for an oil change or my car is going to blow up in like 5 hours lol fuk
163 2018-07-24 23:41:25 Hey All.......the War is in cyberspace!  Right Now. Hurry or it will be over. It’s faster there and it doesn’t need oil.
164 2018-07-24 23:41:23 First night cooking dairy and soy free. Not horrible!  almond milk has a distinct taste. Guess I will get used to it, like coconut oil.
165 2018-07-24 23:41:14 Hey CBD Oil Purest thanks for the follow!
166 2018-07-24 23:41:07 This week TRAITOR TRUMP admin is banning the Endangered Species Act in USA This is for the Fossil Fuel expansion agenda. They bulldoze Natl Parks and Monuments our coastlines , public lands Alaskan Tundra making way for pipelines and oil platforms .
167 2018-07-24 23:41:05 Wake up America! Most of US utilities aren't even owned by Americans. Most components are not American. So are they hacking or just doing every day business. Utilities, gas, oil, power plants, pipelines. America is in a very precarious situation & it's nothing new.

169 2018-07-24 23:40:49 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.

172 2018-07-24 23:40:16 Then why did former President Obama drive out of the Gulf of Mexico oil exploration. I had to work from 2010 through 2016 in the Middle East and West Africa. 

He was a job and economic stifler.

175 2018-07-24 23:39:33 I am capitalism and my anatomy is the anatomy of a monster, I breathe fire, I consume oil, I tinker with your pretty brains.
176 2018-07-24 23:39:27 Add * almond oil, carrot oil, peppermint oil and macadamia oil to y’all list the less hyped oils are the best oils
177 2018-07-24 23:39:26 Oh yeah. That’s old school. My derm told me that when I was 18 and oily as hell, like, you could wax a car with the oil on my face at 18!!! Lol!! He told me the baby shampoo would affect the Ph of my skin and balance it out. It worked!!!!
178 2018-07-24 23:39:03 But nothing beats a $20 @Walmart oil change

181 2018-07-24 23:38:31 Sometimes, I drizzle $20 olive oil on my jack's frozen pizza to make it gourmet.
182 2018-07-24 23:38:28 you and oil .. double win !!
183 2018-07-24 23:38:22 coconut oil & Olive oil forsure. You can also try hair masks(DIY) to restore the shine & the moisture. & find a good leave in conditioner to lock in afterwards! Oh & no towels on your hair lol
184 2018-07-24 23:38:13 leave out the nuts, reduce the oil, add some lemon zest
185 2018-07-24 23:38:08 Hmmmm.  I was thinking about asking you what you thought about putting it in EMU oil for the face.  I wonder if regular c60 would work in Emu oil for the skin/face.  It penetrates far deeper than any other product and is often used for sunburns and injuries with amazing results.
186 2018-07-24 23:37:51 Wind&Solar require 100% 24/7 on-tap fully-staffed baseload (nuke,gas,coal,oil) backup needed. Kinda expensive. Very unreliable (when the wind doesn't blow or the sun doesn't shine, like EVERY NIGHT!).
187 2018-07-24 23:37:48 I’m gone be making my oil later this week i gotta get my samples out 
188 2018-07-24 23:37:45 I see that sesame oil on a low.. use it gently
189 2018-07-24 23:37:44 Fr it's the best oil man's used. Funny thing is I had to order it all the way from London via eBay coz we don't have it here 
190 2018-07-24 23:37:42 Russia Russia Russia - Platon Lebedev and his partner Mikhail Khortikosky had been propping up political parties against the Kremlin. They'd been failing to pay taxes into the millions and owned Siberian oil. THESE JAILED CROOKS HAD AN ALLY IN THE U.S  - HILLARY CLINTON GANG!
191 2018-07-24 23:37:37 You all miss the point. Summer is in full swing, gas is still too high, and we are pumping more oil than ever before. Got my Mobil exon card invite in the mail. Take me out of here.
192 2018-07-24 23:37:27 I make it at least three times a week and always read hot oil then add kernels - accidentally added all at once to cold oil at beginning and popped so fluffy that’s the new method. Brown butter is the bomb. Tiniest pinch of sugar in the oil opens flavors even more
193 2018-07-24 23:37:13 Putin will hold back a visit till Trump helps him achieve his goals of getting Obama’s sanctions lifted, invade the rest of the Balkins with oil/pipelines/ship lanes; & gut Iran (who’s selling oil cheaper than he can) so he can control oil/oil prices and fill his coffer.
194 2018-07-24 23:36:55 Bouch is playing with the Oil this year, and it’s a done deal.
195 2018-07-24 23:36:54 Perecan oil is 10% off today!
196 2018-07-24 23:36:44 Dawn dish soap and a little tiny bit of olive oil
197 2018-07-24 23:36:33 Just had an oil change at the Missoula @Valvoline on Broadway for the first time and they were ridiculously friendly and helpful. Definitely going back again!
198 2018-07-24 23:36:23 どれ位減ってるか判らないですが、まずはエンジンヘッドのＯＩＬキャップの裏を観て、乳化してたら早期対応が必要です。
199 2018-07-24 23:36:21 HOT TAKE:  Lucas Oil Raceway is the only track in the city of Indianapolis NASCAR should be running on. Indy was once a dream, now a nightmare.

It's time to move on.

201 2018-07-24 23:35:59 I am not giving him that much credit. The midnight oil should be burning to bring indictments.
202 2018-07-24 23:35:57 The month I got my Chevy I’ll never forget your dad stopped by and said “keep that oil changed and it’ll last forever”
203 2018-07-24 23:35:56 I mixed bentonite clay with black soap, tea tree oil and peppermint oil.

It wasn't a very effective shampoo but I'm on to something there...
204 2018-07-24 23:35:34 I believe the oil in this case represents Christ, the Messiah, not wealth.
205 2018-07-24 23:35:29 No not now a days! Most wars now are fought over change of regimes and oil Afghanistan over an oil pipeline! First you need a reason to go in! False flag attacks by terrorists what have you! That and never forget the Petro Dollars must flow! Can’t sell oil in rubles or Yen!
206 2018-07-24 23:35:23 2 of the oil workers asked me if i wanted them to bring me breakfast last night, you know how dudes make me uncomfortable 
207 2018-07-24 23:35:23 Especially while Big Oil, subsidized by the taxpayers, continues to ship oil and gas to foreign countries.

211 2018-07-24 23:34:50 There are people relying on the authority and the oil that was placed inside of you. The purpose of having a light is to SHINE so that men may draw to Christ. #KeepShining

213 2018-07-24 23:34:37 Grapeseed oil is good for the scalp, I mix it with my conditioners & Avocado oil is moisturizing.
214 2018-07-24 23:34:32 I use Jamaican Black Castor Oil - Extra Dark. It's sick for the facial hair g
215 2018-07-24 23:34:05 I’ll get my oil company to pull some strings @TeamDrydene
216 2018-07-24 23:34:01 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
217 2018-07-24 23:33:47 Cab services are subject to market pressure just like blockbuster and oil. Uber and left is cheap but a lot of cab drivers are not as accommodating as the uber system, some are abhorrently prejudice (like in ny) and also these ease of the app itself is better than trying to flag
218 2018-07-24 23:33:44 Well, about China, they just put Iran on 'death's ground' by refusing to buy any Iranian oil now, switching to the Saudis. It's a Sun Tzu thing. Ignore their noble-sounding spin as to why they did it. They want Iran to make a move.

221 2018-07-24 23:33:29 An NDP fed gov can’t force Alberta to shut down their oil sands, either. And the 100MT cap was negotiated with an *NDP* provincial gov. Sometimes you have to accept pragmatic action.

223 2018-07-24 23:33:20 "Non-greasy!" my sunscreen says, as I put it on and shine like I've dipped my whole body in the best highlighter in existence. I try and rub it in, but it is too late. The oil barrens are coming; tell my wife I love her.
224 2018-07-24 23:33:18 Oil is a good reason to stay away.  Way too much oil in @beyondMeat burgers.
225 2018-07-24 23:33:17 Seeing what Qatar is doing with their oil money makes me wonder if african oil producing countries are selling groundnut oil.   
226 2018-07-24 23:33:09 Worse - invaders. We invaded them for their oil, plain and simple.
227 2018-07-24 23:32:59 Well Done John.  Super well reasoned & informative article on what’s at stake in the Oil Rich Middle East.

230 2018-07-24 23:32:47 Tobacco sales they tell me. Max med drilling to much oil In America for it to sustain without wasting. Trump is@flawed as a President.
231 2018-07-24 23:32:46 The Obama Administration took land away from the states and made it Federal, preventing the states from using their own land. This was done to prevent America's oil Independence and to make America weak. Obama really was The Manchurian Candidate and was not serving Americans.
232 2018-07-24 23:32:39 I use noxzema face wash and apply tea tree oil right after! I used to have the same problem and now my skin is almost always clear
233 2018-07-24 23:32:38 The capitalists rob the planet, rip it open for oil and gold, and leave us with nothing but labor.
234 2018-07-24 23:32:34 Kinda like when Obama placed strangling regulations on oil companies & gave billions to now bankrupted green energy companies?
235 2018-07-24 23:32:34 The global oil crisis was largely to blame for the problems of the 1970s... it was just used as an excuse to attack unions!
236 2018-07-24 23:32:32 I haven’t tried grapeseed and avocado oil lemme hop on the other oils
237 2018-07-24 23:32:31 Perma, agreed the selloff is steep, and while oil was also up today..  holds $40 and runs back up?
238 2018-07-24 23:32:25 Can’t wait til my homie comes back from vacation. I’m doing straight thc oil. I was doing perfect with that. Lol
239 2018-07-24 23:32:23 I had the same problem a few years ago, during the day (especially during the weekend or lazy days in my house) I just kept a bottle of just viatimin e oil and basically kept my lips covered in it.
240 2018-07-24 23:32:20 Tell them if they want to serve the youth, use the oil revenues to build a modern Guyana! Stop relying on foreigners and have the oil companies pay to establish monitoring institutions and for training programmes. Establish a unity government to move the country beyond politics!
241 2018-07-24 23:32:20 Cook with coconut oil. Workout recovery with tumeric, brazil nuts, and electrolytes to cut down on inflammation. Bhb salt before workout with some caffeine helps. Dandelion tea and bouillon r tasty instead of just water. Collagen and MCT also assist staying active.

250 2018-07-24 23:31:55 For Iran one nation matters more than any other to its oil economy, and it is also Trump's largest global trade rival: China. — feeling thoughtful
251 2018-07-24 23:31:49 I’d just like clear concise specific answers to clear questions. He’s so ambiguous, long winded and often self-contradictory, it is hard not to feel like you’re listening to a snake oil salesman. Not saying he is one, but this is rare op to cut thru fat str8 to the meat of things
252 2018-07-24 23:31:42 @lisamurkowski 95 in Fairbanks! Do you understand the slightest detail on climate change, you shill for Trump!? Just pump more oil and we'll all be dead, you stupid cow!
253 2018-07-24 23:31:35 What socio-economic system made us wealthy? And why does Sen Sanders want to see its opposite adopted? Makes no sense whatsoever.
254 2018-07-24 23:31:15 They are baked in a combination of ricbran oil and virgin olive oil (for flavour) and basted four times, so they are super crunchy and glorious.
The dip is sour cream +  extra garlic aioli + lemon juice from half a lemon.
255 2018-07-24 23:30:58 I have concerns on Athabasca Oil because of their high dilutent costs and return to WCS spreads, Leismer bitumen production cuts now going to Statoil while netback is negative.  Think $CVE $CPG and $BTE will do well, not as confident on $GXE or $ATH but WCS did improve for Q2

258 2018-07-24 23:30:28 You are right, but also there is a sizable amount of uneducated and working class who vote against their interests. Economic prosperity and education will help them (or their children) make smarter political decisions and see through demagogue's snake oil rhetoric.
259 2018-07-24 23:30:21 Welcome to "Bernie-nomics"
260 2018-07-24 23:30:18 I need some more oil. 
261 2018-07-24 23:30:10 Terrible more of the problem.

Greedy
Selfish
Wicked.

The culture living large isn't helping, it was heralded in by the oil boom.
262 2018-07-24 23:30:00 Record-level oil production here in the U.S. isn’t providing relief at the #gas pump, despite the fact that just last week we reached a new production record of 11 million barrels per day. It's very hard for us to drill our way out of this problem.
263 2018-07-24 23:29:59 What’s your favorite oil control and pore minimizing primers girls? Pls help my indecisive self
264 2018-07-24 23:29:55 those are 'Real' wages, not 'Nominal' wages.  Nominal wages are up, but there is always a lag.  'Real' means inflation adjusted and 40% of inflation is energy prices.  Crude oil is up 180% since the 2015-16 collapse

pull nominal wages.  totally different chart
265 2018-07-24 23:29:35 Lol I’ll never smoke a blunt again. Who knew there were so many plugs here with oil. 
266 2018-07-24 23:29:35 That’s interesting. Skincare surely is holistic. Coconut oil is pretty amazing stuff.
267 2018-07-24 23:29:19 Nope his handlers or the Koch's just want to get the last oil out of him to disrupt POTUS like usual...

I'm too old to put up with this shit.
271 2018-07-24 23:28:39 @VOX well-known as just another bought and paid for media arm for the DNC. And btw, I change the oil and filter in my car myself. I would never presume doing so would give me the expertise to tell people what they can and can't drive.
272 2018-07-24 23:28:38 rice noodles with a lil sesame oil + red peeper flakes and some chicken tenders was a good choice 
273 2018-07-24 23:28:23 Trump is very much a snake oil salesmen: he manufactures problems and then shows people how ‘great’ he is by fixing them. Trump may be dumb, but, from his history, he is a genius at branding and that is all he is doing now as president #tytlive
274 2018-07-24 23:28:17 Do you have a preferred MCT oil or MCT oil powder you'd recommend?

276 2018-07-24 23:28:02 Food for oil? I've heard this before and it didn't go well
277 2018-07-24 23:27:56 ALCO Sup Haggerty, who represents Livermore, will vote against oil producer's permit: "I can't go with staff recommendation and I know in my hearts of hearts this is going to wind up in court." #alcomtg
278 2018-07-24 23:27:54 To sell them more gas/oil?
279 2018-07-24 23:27:54 @MAGAnificient lets build plant extracts oil from coal  this increases our USA oil41% more and we can dominate oil sales in the WORLD. processed perfected in WW2.
280 2018-07-24 23:27:48 the fact that my hair still smells of that lemon grass oil *calming*
281 2018-07-24 23:27:46 Sitting in my car while my oil is being changed & I lowkey wanna fall asleep to the sounds of them changing my oil bc it’s so relaxing lol

it's  less than R30
284 2018-07-24 23:27:15 This is not a joke. You will shit yourself. Careful with the MCT oil!
285 2018-07-24 23:27:14 Oh whoa... it's almost like invading some country halfway across the world for more oil or something #Warcraft
286 2018-07-24 23:27:07 If that's stealing from tax payers, I have news for you, the oil industry steals 4.5 trillion a year.....
287 2018-07-24 23:27:04 black oil in the oil lines...etc

289 2018-07-24 23:26:48 Self-care is when I start the day putting rosehip oil on my face and end it putting buffalo sauce on everything else
290 2018-07-24 23:26:47 Your Administration is undertaking polluting our air and water, selling oil/mineral/grazing rights on public land to the highest bidder, and ruining the rebounding economy you inherited. You seek to limit rights of women, POC, voters, and any who dare criticize you. #Propaganda
291 2018-07-24 23:26:46 あんなん、同窓会に来たら同級生の男子なんて絶対自分の奥さんと比べちゃうでしょう？
292 2018-07-24 23:26:46 Do you have a preferred MCT oil or MCT oil powder you'd recommend?
293 2018-07-24 23:26:28 Well said, I support the PM too, and would like to hear a lot more from him about current issues such as oil prices, job opportunities, etc.; instead of talking about the 60 yrs of INC.
294 2018-07-24 23:26:18 I now have to add to tea tree oil to my shampoo and conditioner the feeling is addictive
295 2018-07-24 23:26:14 Any body butter with palm kernel oil in it is pure bliss
296 2018-07-24 23:26:14 Last time I checked, they opposed coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear and even some hydro. Without those energy sources probably six billion persons would starve to death or die in other ways in one year. Is this what Greenpeace wants? 
297 2018-07-24 23:25:56 He is your autocrat! - Traded oil drilling for your vote on tax cuts - you will vote for his SC nominee - why should he start listening to the GOP congress now?  GOP created this monster  - you are now reaping what you sowed.
298 2018-07-24 23:25:56 my oil problem
299 2018-07-24 23:25:46 Elon Musk shouldn't sue him, but...

Montana skeptic is not a journalist. I regularly read his shit, n he was clearly intentionally spreading misleading information about Tesla to push down the price of the stock. And he should have disclosed he was heavily invested in oil n gas
300 2018-07-24 23:25:37 朝ドラの若村麻由美、年取らないよなぁ～、キレイだなぁ～って思って調べたら、私より１か月年下なだけだと知って、今日はショックで寝込む予定です。おはようございます！
301 2018-07-24 23:25:36 The US has great soil and can produce food. Other countries have oil and rare earth minerals in abundance. Maybe we should set up a system where we give food and get those things. I don’t know what we’d call this concept though #TYTLive
302 2018-07-24 23:25:15 Coconut oil is hella weak nnnnnnnnnnn
303 2018-07-24 23:25:12 Wages were down b4 Trump and now coming back up. Trump does not control gas prices, OPEC does with how much oil they produce. African-Americans employment is up or were you asleep the last few months.
304 2018-07-24 23:25:08 Yeah that’s what it’s called for whatever reason. They have a number of hot oil treatments with different names
305 2018-07-24 23:25:07 それ！このドンカツたまたまやもん笑笑
306 2018-07-24 23:24:44 Bertie gave away the last 25% of Irish shares in our own oil...how much $$$ did he receive from shell and Stat oil to sell out the Irish people?
307 2018-07-24 23:24:23 ليش تنطق و تكتب ويهي و هي وجهي من وين يابيين هاللهية
308 2018-07-24 23:24:20 Are they still bearish on oil? Or is this one bullish?
309 2018-07-24 23:24:17 Needham probably received a big check or has heavy bags in big oil / another competitor probably @elonmusk
310 2018-07-24 23:24:06 Ooh! Bread's easy, if a bit of work - if you can find gluten-free flour, you can make your own bread with just water an' oil; it'll be a bit flat, though. Could use some baking (soda... powder? I forget...) and egg to give it some floof. May take a li'l while, but can work, yeh.
311 2018-07-24 23:24:04 Coconut oil 
312 2018-07-24 23:23:52 Literally spraying myself with lavender oil, bug repellent and making a sacrifice to the gods just so I don’t get another damn mosquito bite tonight
313 2018-07-24 23:23:42 You know it is hot when your coconut oil hasn’t been solid for two weeks.

315 2018-07-24 23:23:34 If you don’t think medical marijuana works for pain consider this: my mom was at 90% the max dose of opiates for her chronic pain from #neurofibromatosis & using CBD oil and she’s now off them entirely. With THC maybe she’ll be able to sleep  #NF #MedicalMarijuana @ChildrensTumor
316 2018-07-24 23:23:32 Take out the piercing and clean it with diluted tea tree oil and then put the piercing back in MENDIGO
317 2018-07-24 23:23:31 Seeing articles (sources unfamiliar) saying Montana Skeptic is a heavily invested in oil. 
318 2018-07-24 23:23:03 just ate the healthiest chicken sandwich I ever made in my whole life, no mayonnaise, no oil required, no salt etc and omg it is so damn good. I'm so proud of myself this morning
319 2018-07-24 23:22:40 Warms up the oil.
320 2018-07-24 23:22:30 But it's not that Venezuela is dependent on oil. I mean, it is, but hyperinflation has occurred in many different countries.
321 2018-07-24 23:22:26 Ask yourself why we never in any media papers or telly hear any mention of the words
BANKRUPT
CORRUPT
From oil rich to trillions in debt.
WM doesnt work for English peeps either
322 2018-07-24 23:22:23 Doing kettle bell exercises with a jug of vegetable oil cause I can't get to the gym smh
323 2018-07-24 23:22:20 No he is an self serving racist idiot.  Also the "western culture" has been on the wrong side of history many times, native american genocide, slavery, oil wars, Holocaust, etc etc
324 2018-07-24 23:22:06 Our other podcast is Comfortable Place On The Couch, and it's about the band Midnight Oil. If you really just like hearing us talk, or you happen to like that music, totally listen to it :) But otherwise, yeah you'll have to wait a bit.
325 2018-07-24 23:22:04 Preheat the onion rings, peel and grill on top of extra virgin olive oil if you prepare the remaining whoopie ingredients.
326 2018-07-24 23:21:49 I don't have curly hair.. but i have super frizzy hair.. marrocan oil is literally a life saver and smells so freaking good.
327 2018-07-24 23:21:31 you know me, i'm such an old lady  honestly tho, efficascent oil is life 
328 2018-07-24 23:21:15 Me too. Sir Lien Velour with his mechashifting biped|wheeled-quadruped legs and dual mechashifting (greatmace|lance)s, stored in a slow-burning oil, won't be visualized for a while.
329 2018-07-24 23:21:14 I’d love an oil painting of myself enjoying a class of Chardonnay.
330 2018-07-24 23:21:06 Buying votes.   It works.
331 2018-07-24 23:21:01 When combined this Peak oil, we're in big trouble. We've used about half the oil, the cheep half. Won't take 150 year to use the other half. Forgetting global warming and ocean acidification.
332 2018-07-24 23:20:41 Oh my God yes. My current July set has some oil shots involved so make sure to see it, before it goes bye bye!
333 2018-07-24 23:20:22 A good article, but it fails to recall two key elements of decline:
1) Howard Dean's treason-loving Left, interested in more in electoral victory than national success
2) European perfidy embodied in UN's "Oil for Fraud" scandal, back-stabbing America for momentary fiscal gain
334 2018-07-24 23:20:15 Sean Hannity to Jim Jordan: 
"By the way, I'm sorry you went through that smear campaign and also that you ran out of baby oil while watching those supple wrestlers getting molested while taking unusually long hot showers in the locker room then not saying shit about it."
335 2018-07-24 23:20:13 Great... they are going to get the government involved and ruin associates degrees now.
336 2018-07-24 23:20:07 No it’s called cleanser, toner, moisturizer and beard oil!!
337 2018-07-24 23:20:06 John, are they willing to put the extra barrels of oil through as requested by President Trump to bring down price of oil and petrol prices at the pumps?
338 2018-07-24 23:20:01 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
339 2018-07-24 23:19:43 A visit to Association of Oil Marketing Companies (AOMC) at GIMPA to discuss potential market for LPG beyond cooking,Good news is almost 80% if it’s members have LPG infrastructure for both cooking and AUTOGAS job made easy.

Do you never think how can an oil rich country like scotland be skint?
Trusting the snp is NOT the risk here
WM has bankrupted an oil rich UK
We need that on a bus

360 2018-07-24 23:16:45 Big problem with offering subsidies: they are never rolled back when a “crisis” is over. Reference: 1993 oil & gas lowered leases to increase production. Still in place!!
361 2018-07-24 23:16:41 I finished the mountain mural in my bedroom finally!  My Gramma Plummer crocheted the blue afghan and my Great Granny Metz painted the flower oil paintings on the wall.  I am thankful that I inherited some creative genes from the Metz side of the family!

367 2018-07-24 23:15:38 Would tariffs not be a catalyst for making our own materials? Why do we need to rely on others for steel or aluminum or oil or anything else? We can do that here, can we not? Please correct me if I am wrong.
368 2018-07-24 23:15:19 I made aappointment to get my cars oil change and niggas already calling me talking about want to trade in your car for a newer one. Bitchhhh lol

370 2018-07-24 23:15:04 Snake oil.
371 2018-07-24 23:15:04 The US Supreme Court has lost all of its credibility; the right wing hacks vote for the right wing nut job policies. More snake oil.

374 2018-07-24 23:14:45 @realDonaldTrump is attempting to patch things up with farmers hurt by the trade war he initiated by announcing a $12 billion bailout for them.
His own @GOP idiots are not happy.

“What about manufacturing sector? The energy sector? The oil & gas industries?” @lisamurkowski cries
375 2018-07-24 23:14:44 I’ve seen enough to know you’re using the last one for your fifteen minutes of fame? You are the first snake oil salesmen to do it but you might be the worst.

379 2018-07-24 23:14:36 Partex Oil and Gas has access to oil and gas assets based on the percentage ownership of resources estimated to be produced throughout the remaining life of the concessions in which the Group participates.
380 2018-07-24 23:14:32 The oil and gas resources of the Group at the end of 2005 reached 215 million barrels of oil equivalent, showing a clear increase in relation to 2004.[citation needed]
381 2018-07-24 23:14:31 Rather than focus on what jersey someone wears, we need to focus on WHO they are and what they are fighting for. There are some bad Dems that side with big money/war/oil/etc. or Trump far too often (Manchin, McCaskill, etc.). We're down to 30% of voters, we NEED to court indies
382 2018-07-24 23:14:30 Dapat nana nimu ichain. Bring back the wallet chain.
383 2018-07-24 23:14:18 The Partex Oil and Gas Group is basically organized by geographical areas and holds interests in concessions and joint ventures engaged in upstream activities related to the oil and gas industry, namely exploration, development, production and sales.
384 2018-07-24 23:14:14 I heard test E has a quicker release time and leaves the body quicker because of the sesame seed oil. I use Test C with cottonseed oil for a slower release.
385 2018-07-24 23:14:07 I’ve rekindled my love of coconut oil. My skin and hair are so soft I feel like a goddess 
386 2018-07-24 23:14:07 Bullshit. You want their OIL. It's all about Israel and Oil for a pipeline.

391 2018-07-24 23:13:09 Tooth pain is the worst. Clove oil or ouzo rubbed into the gum are all I can advise aside from strong prescription drugs. Walk in clinic tomorrow if still terrible?
392 2018-07-24 23:13:07 Yup, some things never change. They can't come up with new ideas, so get the base addicted to government freebies...How the HELL does anyone create personal wealth that way??!! 
393 2018-07-24 23:13:00 #Hollywood stars like Matt Damon say that fracking is bad.

But Damon also owns a Bentley, a Ferrari and a Porsche, all which need oil to work. So yeah stop fracking I guess…..?
394 2018-07-24 23:12:57 oil can break down latex condoms! and i wouldn’t really recommend lotion but if you use it, get it without a artificial smell.
395 2018-07-24 23:12:51 (or for that matter that western countries won't watch the entire population of the middle east die of heatstroke and immediately be like "awesome! more oil and natural gas for us!" and send in the drilling platforms manned by disposable 3rd world workers who will themselves die)

400 2018-07-24 23:12:09 The United States has meddled in the elections of 81 countries by Invasion e.g. Iraq or coup e.g. Iran. It's not about bringing democracy it's about oil. The U.S. stance on interference rings hallow. Fix the system. Can't hack paper ballots.
401 2018-07-24 23:11:57 It’s #InternationalSelfCareDay and I’m both sleep-deprived and also a lover of corny Twitter threads. The thing about self-care, is that it’s important even when everything’s going well. You change your oil regularly to keep your car running, don’t you?

406 2018-07-24 23:11:27 I doubt they would be making this kind of a fuss about new subsurface ice deposits, but somewhere very interesting at low altitudes? Oil/gas deposits? Probably not buried alien cities? #nessunialieni

426 2018-07-24 23:08:34 This agreement had a fundamental influence on the future development of the oil reserves in the Middle East and led directly to the Partex Oil and Gas Group's present interests in the United Arab Emirates and the Sultanate of Oman.

438 2018-07-24 23:07:03 Its also because the stores are practically impossible to clean. Everything is cooked in oil. There's spills everywhere and of those spills aren't cleaned thoroughly right away they will stay there for years until the building gets renovated. It just builds up over time

452 2018-07-24 23:04:57 so people who are working 3 jobs and want healthcare only vote democrat because they want "handouts" 

but rich guys voting themselves a tax cut and farmers getting direct cash subsidies and oil companies repealing their own regulations... those are go-getters
453 2018-07-24 23:04:48 It was rich with oil, mislead by socialists

459 2018-07-24 23:04:02 Oil is not a major motivation. Most states do not care at all. 

You can believe the opposite obviously.

But please do not troll me.

463 2018-07-24 23:03:05 He does make a good point though - in a world of 3 day weeks created by the miners and an oil crisis we all got through without any issues - this time we might run low on Camembert, Quinoa and Merlot but hey ho

496 2018-07-24 23:00:23 I have yet to see *anyone* cover the basic science:

-Every day Earth absorbs heat from 
 the sun AND releases heat stored 
 in oil/gas/coal/nukes

-Heat (energy) is never destroyed, 
 it just changes form

-Earth CAN ONLY cool by radiating heat
 to Space, but CO2 prevents that
497 2018-07-24 23:00:10 I will likely be using mainly CBD oil with no THC so I can still function at work

511 2018-07-24 22:56:45 Can you have a word with your colleagues? This is bigger than BBC political affiliation or fevered ego's. Seriously, we're out of time, BBC needs to focus on who is going to make the change we need the fastest. Currently your organisation is in bed with big oil, gas and fracking.
512 2018-07-24 22:56:37 The paste is the original product after it has been extracted from the plant. The CBD oil has had further purifucation and been mixed with hemp oil to take as drops. Some people take oil in the day & paste at night. Varies really. Strengths vary from 4% - 30% CBD for both.
513 2018-07-24 22:56:32 Or palm oil

515 2018-07-24 22:56:17 If the #US is such a friend of the #Iranian people, why does it impose a #travelban on them, why does it impose sanctions not just on oil but on carpets and fruits, why did it support #Saddam's invasion and continues to threaten #Iran and calls the #PersianGulf the "ArabianGulf"?
516 2018-07-24 22:56:17 I use miss Jessie’s, black castle oil (products) and dark and lovely natural mostly
517 2018-07-24 22:56:03 That’s like oil & water isn’t it.
518 2018-07-24 22:56:02 My area in Western N.Y. has been and continues to fight these "snake oil" salesmen (Big Wind companies). The health issues that effect humans, animals and the environmental concerns seem to fall on the deaf ears of most of our town board members because of the money they offer.
519 2018-07-24 22:55:52 I luv smelling like tea tree oil
520 2018-07-24 22:55:39 @laurenfits are you affiliated with the exotic oil company? Just curious.

527 2018-07-24 22:54:52 Tbh I wouldnt trust anything that they 'pre seasoned' cause then its gotta be done with something that wasn't food and that just sounds not legit lol. Id scrub it down and rub some olive oil in there with a rag.
528 2018-07-24 22:54:49 If you wish to believe that oil is the principal reason #France, the #UAE, #Turkey, #Qatar, #SaudiArabia are interfering today in #Libya, knock yourself out.

But please don’t troll me.

By the way, your article doesn’t say oil is the main motivation.
529 2018-07-24 22:54:48 Like the Big Oil Biz ritual:
"Not enough gas, gotta raise price"
"Too much gas, gotta raise price"
"Demand too high, gotta raise price"
"Demand too low, gotta raise price"
It's all double-dicking; they fuck us coming AND going.
530 2018-07-24 22:54:34 Wow the guy doing my oil change is a babe
531 2018-07-24 22:54:32 Damn bro you tried to do your oil change?
532 2018-07-24 22:54:27 my old standby is salt & vegetable oil to rub off any stuck bits so i guess im gonna do that later
533 2018-07-24 22:54:25 Sometimes I think the Car Corporations are in with the Oil Corporations, and do they make our cars have worse gas mileage so we have to buy gasoline more often.  Lol
534 2018-07-24 22:54:03 I do synthetic oil which lasts 5,000 miles and it’s $35 :)
535 2018-07-24 22:54:01 Going Keto made the necessity for moisturizer non existent(and even then I made my own, whipped and non whipped coconut oil blends)
536 2018-07-24 22:54:01 The dealership is about to make fun of me I’m sure, because the car has like no oil in it. But it’s not our fault, it’s the guys that sold it to us

541 2018-07-24 22:53:08 Better get use to 6 more years! 4 million new jobs,lowest unemployment in 50 years. Taxes are lowered. ISIS is being Destroy. North Korea started removing there missle sites. US is a exporter of oil and gas now.  5 new Steel factorys being built. Golden Age now
542 2018-07-24 22:53:00 This is a blue state, he hasn't set foot in too often.  He's got to get back at us by polluting our state, carbon emission removal, deregs on water, oil drilling off the coast. He needs to remember we're the 5th(?) largest economy in the world.
543 2018-07-24 22:52:57 need some oil for the train perhaps?
544 2018-07-24 22:52:50 Say what you want about living in a small town where “nothing happens”, but I bet you city folks can’t get an oil change with a tire rotation for $20 just because your grandpa knows everyone

547 2018-07-24 22:52:13 @davidsirota ... when I drive through Northern Texas through the Amarillo panhandle, I always get a sense of hope when I see the thousands of wind turbines spinning energy in oil country ... climate change is not what you should be covering ...
548 2018-07-24 22:52:07 Damn that is rather unusual of cast iron. Have you tried 'seasoning it' after a good scrub? I've seen that cast iron needs to be cooked with oil alone and allowed to absorb the oils a bit before it helps with the sticking. We got a panini grill at my work and we do that
549 2018-07-24 22:52:04 svt saved not only the kpop industry but the oil industry and ended both world wars the cold war the vietnam war and they brought peace to the korean peninsula

554 2018-07-24 22:51:19 @iammrssamuels needs to make an essential oil blend called "leave me the hell alone". I'd rub that shit all over myself and buy a lifetime supply!  #RHOP
555 2018-07-24 22:51:00 I use nothing but kirks coconut oil  soap and gold bond radiant renewal lotion,
556 2018-07-24 22:50:55 Think Oil Kings were 1st this last season. 

My broader point is 22 teams is a lot of Teams for the WHL IMO. 

Does moving an NHL and Possibly AHL team into the same geographic area make it make sense to contract a team or two and therefore make the league stronger.
557 2018-07-24 22:50:45 I would rather see the oil companies build a few refineries in Fort Muck rather than exporting raw bitumen. The place is already a wasteland so a few more distillation stacks wont change anything. More bucks and jobs for the dead dinosaurs decayed corpses.
558 2018-07-24 22:50:33 The ideology of insatiable acquisitiveness. Either that or Hon Senator Guccibiamila is high in GWagon oil
559 2018-07-24 22:50:25 it’s oil 
560 2018-07-24 22:50:10 @Jacob_Rees_Mogg I hope you & your colleagues are burning the midnight oil!
561 2018-07-24 22:50:03 A living mouse in the engine bay while I was doing a customers oil change. They love nibbling at the wires for some reason.
562 2018-07-24 22:49:46 Hey you fucking dork! US #Sanctions cause and have caused the #death's of many hundreds of thousands of people. 
I bet you like Trump also claim - "We don't worship government we worship God?"
Satan??
What does #God Almighty say about your coveting $45,000,000,000,000 in Oil?
563 2018-07-24 22:49:45 if oil is made from dinosaur fossils and plastic is made from oil, plastic dinosaurs are made from real dinosuars
564 2018-07-24 22:49:39 ok. time for cbd oil and more sleep. hopefully.

569 2018-07-24 22:48:58 Mr. President me thinks thou doest protest too much. It’s getting boring. If you want to do something good in your spare time then push Congress to legalize marijuana so I can use CBD oil in a federally funded Nursing Home.Will illiminate the need for-many medications save $$$
570 2018-07-24 22:48:58 Good Lord yes it feels so good. Some of it I had to take was old cooking oil I'd collected and was storing before I had time to get it to the recycling plant. The bin was full so nearly got the splashes all over me as I was emptying it. Gross job but had to be done. Such a relief
571 2018-07-24 22:48:57 Seeing what Qatar is doing with their oil money makes me wonder if it's groundnut oil that Nigeria is selling.

573 2018-07-24 22:48:43 I can’t leave the house without my watch, lipstick and oil 
574 2018-07-24 22:48:40 You're not educated if you learn words. You're educated when you the timing and tone to use them.

Right words at wrong time can work like oil on flame instead of water.

Choose words wisely.
575 2018-07-24 22:48:38 been waiting to get my oil change for two hours now 
576 2018-07-24 22:48:23 Yeah this is a market that is really punishing select sectors right now. I've been guilty of not diversifying enough before this. But my oil/industrial names are kinda floating my PF when the international tech/volatile names get hammered.
577 2018-07-24 22:48:21 Trump is surrounded by Saudi Arabia, Pompeo, Netanyahu, Bolton, & others all urging war.

Some counter by saying Iran's friend Russia will stop him...but I can easily see Russia sell-out Iran in exchange for the massive oil price spike that will happen if there is war with Iran.
578 2018-07-24 22:48:10 4 minutes of goal post jumping might be fun to gain some extra points, but Oil Ocean’s Act 1 goal post is the one you exploit for as long as you want~ >u> It’s dead centre and you end up in a designated place after the boss, so you just keep jumping! Easy points~
579 2018-07-24 22:48:07 Aye, and that bastard hid Scotland's oil wealth for decades because his country needed it.
580 2018-07-24 22:47:56 Cannot relate!! My skin barely produces oil... Maybe a tad when it's hot af but not really
581 2018-07-24 22:47:44 Let's recognize Ryan Zinke for his environmental initiatives.
Today he said the Trump Administration would only allow  drilling in the Alaskan Wilderness until they find and extract the oil.
582 2018-07-24 22:47:30 Deep fried in hot boiling oil.  Then feed the scrawny, dried up thing to the cats.  My dogs wouldn't touch it.
583 2018-07-24 22:47:12 I’m not sure who thought it would be a good idea to put truffle oil in queso, but that person should be sainted.
584 2018-07-24 22:46:51 Langley because of a smaller rink and better deal. Ice were playing out of the agricom which was a terrible place to watch hockey. Decent crowds but the owner never wanted to be there . Oil kings are second in attendance in the WHL
585 2018-07-24 22:46:36 We are only 9 meals / 3 days from running out of food & medicine now  - or has everyone really forgotton Surtsey & Oil strike impacts? If Brexit makes us more resilient, then it makes sense to me.
586 2018-07-24 22:46:35 killing two birds with one stone as I get my oil change and edit these pictures.
587 2018-07-24 22:46:21 We also do lotsa Phoenix Tears. We only give it away. Never sold a drop. It's magic stuff. We do wax/shatter & just bought a rosin press. We also make medicated candy, butter, and infused coconut oil as a topical pain reliever. I wanna run some QWISO soon.
588 2018-07-24 22:46:16 “LISTEN KAREN I CANT STOP YOUR SKIN FROM MAKING OIL”

589 2018-07-24 22:46:14 Thank you @DavidBegnaud for keeping on the radar. My Dad was a manager at Yabucoa Sun Oil & this incredible island welcomed us with open arms. we were so saddened by what is happening in PR. Keep bringing attention to PR!
590 2018-07-24 22:46:12 It’s called oil but named lubricant
591 2018-07-24 22:46:11 One of many causes,but a big one.
No one had his back. 
The mafia.
The oil men

593 2018-07-24 22:45:56 Baba want to use our oil do trade by barter for Niger people that will help him win with fake votes. 

Just look at ordinary Niger,  we are now so low. 

And Baba want to leave Niger delta where oil is and build refineries in Katisina,  bad planer with bad fate.

599 2018-07-24 22:45:19 I can't believe how bad my local @pepboysauto has gotten. First they couldn't find my web appointment, then when I rescheduled they told my wife they didn't know how to do an oil change on the car! Told her it might void the warranty? Wtf?
600 2018-07-24 22:45:07 Tried it on the grill? It gets pretty good when combined with oil, salt, pepper, and flame.

608 2018-07-24 22:44:27 Chick-Fil-A is so damn friendly. They’ll fuck around and give me an oil change in the drive through.
609 2018-07-24 22:44:24 Results are. N Korea, Syria, Sudan, EU NATO, China,  Mexico, Canada. You heard anything about Afghanistan or Iraq ISIS? No? How about the $. Oil? Saudi's maybe South America? Watching your run.Please come up with something better. Your running against another version of yourself?
610 2018-07-24 22:44:23 I take my coffee black, but some folks prefer it with blood, coke, and oil
611 2018-07-24 22:44:19 There are non plastic, cornstarch options. This is about big oil.
612 2018-07-24 22:43:39 Sorry, I'm chuckling. I would go out on hottest AZ days, lay out in the sun, smear baby oil all over, & still had to work at getting a darker TAN. Course, it didn't hurt none that the Nat'l Reserve guys across the street would fly over in helicopters haha. Yes, that was in 73.
613 2018-07-24 22:43:31 Sarah Lunnie & Michael Walkup & Tim Sanford said "and so the answer is no! Don't even think about bringing that fried atrocity in the hallowed halls of PH! No oil stains on the furniture or in the rehearsal rooms!"  They will call the PoPo on MiMiJaJa with a quickness

615 2018-07-24 22:43:11 problem with Twitter is no one wants to engage in productive conversation. AB debt is 30billion NDP project  a rise to 90billion. S&P and Moodys downgraded our credit. Investment is below other oil producing areas. you can argue the pros and cons but these are facts.

617 2018-07-24 22:42:56 Steps
1. put one teaspoon ( tsp ) of aloe vera gel in the small container
2. add 2 tsp of castor oil

4. cut and empty two capsules of vitamin e in the mixture
5. Mix

619 2018-07-24 22:42:39 Compare their policies regarding Russia. See the difference? For one, Obama kept the Russian economy afloat by doing everything her could to keep oil prices up. Think about that and lose the pictures. We'll talk.

621 2018-07-24 22:41:53 My oldest nephew has soft curls, on some 4A shit

I told him when he was 15, when I had to help convince his parents to let him get a fro and I told him wash onxe a week or every 2, and def add coconut oil

"Nah I ain't doing that."
"Wake up with brittle ass hair if you want to."
622 2018-07-24 22:41:52 what condition will you find your park in?

will it be damaged by oil drilling? will animals be actively hunted? is it your park? 

speak out! don't let them take our parks from us, the people of the US.
623 2018-07-24 22:41:39 Flour, sugar, Brown sugar, baking soda, salt, oil and a milk replacement! I would drop a recipe but I don’t really measure when I bake lol. But u can use almost any recipe and just swap the milk for vegan milk and swap the eggs with apple sauce
624 2018-07-24 22:41:27 not to be that girl but there are few things I love more than my color changing oil diffuser
625 2018-07-24 22:41:26 We are slowly losing our culture in Africa, I just saw a guy washing his hands after eating Fat cakes instead of rubbing the oil on his head. 
626 2018-07-24 22:41:17 So u must need followers? Lost half of ur followers when Twitter deleted fake accounts?  You’re a con man. Snake oil salesman. You are not a spokesperson for Jesus. You’ll be judged. Like us all. And it won’t be pretty.
627 2018-07-24 22:41:07 Gosh would love to see where YOU are in 6 mo.

639 2018-07-24 22:40:01 •Other oils to use can be fennel oil, jojoba essential oil and rosemary essential oil! 

•Eat a healthy diet. Eating foods that contain a lot of salt will cause fat sells to swell

•Drink plenty of water 

•Exfoliate more often on areas that have cellulite.

647 2018-07-24 22:38:54 why end at farmers.... energy needs a bailout for talking down oil, tech needs a bailout for chinese antics, healthcare needs a bailout to offset pressure to not raise prices.  anyone in downstream metals needs help to offset steel tariffs; where does it end?
648 2018-07-24 22:38:41 So let’s make sure we get this straight.   Visa free access for China but denial of entry for Venezuelans? No more oil, no more friendship? Oh how cruel our world can be. Hope the Chinese largesse goes on indefinitely, otherwise same stick jook goat may jook sheep one day!

651 2018-07-24 22:38:15 I hate coming to the Dealership to get an oil change 
652 2018-07-24 22:38:13 Freeze enough to last you until next year.  Dry the rest.  Crush the dried, then *very* gently simmer ~400g/l in a light oil for ~45 minutes, until dark, then strain and cool.  Use to pep up, well, pretty much everything.

Remind me to tell you this again next week.
653 2018-07-24 22:38:13 He disclosed that he was short at the bottom of every piece. He even discouraged readers from shorting the stock in most of the pieces. The oil accusation is meaningless... Ross Gerber has positions in ExxonMobil and Chevron for crying out loud.
654 2018-07-24 22:38:10 And we get most of our oil  imports from you guys #betyoudidntknow
655 2018-07-24 22:37:50 Why do I owe businesses subsidies ?  Seems to me that if my tax dollars are invested in football stadiums, Amazon, Oil companies, etc . I should be getting a share of that profit . I would much rather invest in college than making someone else rich at my detriment.
656 2018-07-24 22:37:49 Funny how nobody is trying to talk about the fact that Putin and Winnie The Pooh (XiJingPing) just cockblocked the hell out of USA by delaying sanctions on NorthKorea for exceeding their allowed 500k barrels of oil, even though the Putin summit went so frickin well.
657 2018-07-24 22:37:33 Oitments with petroleum jelly or mineral oil 
Try to apply cream within 3 minuets of bathing
Rub cream between hands then apply downwards
Doctors can also perscribe topical cream
Try to avoid fragranced and dyed cream
Certain foods can worsen eczema
658 2018-07-24 22:37:24 I have seen the references to "16 oil and gas related fires and explosions" since Firestone. I am researching the details. I suspect it includes incidents like a fire caused by smoking at a gas pump.
659 2018-07-24 22:37:14 •Try dry brushing. It is really an affective way to minimize the cellulite!

•Rubbing coconut oil daily onto areas that have cellulite will help break down the fatty deposits in the skin cells.

•Exercise does also work but not as effectively as the suggestions mentioned above

663 2018-07-24 22:36:43 2/2 And until Trump left the Iran Deal Iran wasn't hostile too. But I understand that the US has a Problem with the Geopolitical Position of Iran because it could quite literally devastate the Oil Import into the US.
664 2018-07-24 22:36:40 in this case, EV adoption rate alone may not necessarily lead to lower oil consumption within a given timeframe.
665 2018-07-24 22:36:29 You guys are clinging on to us because of oil! The very oil your take and give to France for free! Very foolish indeed! France has nothing but they live a good life using your resources! When will you learn? Your dictator of 86 years old is there and you support him! Shameful!
666 2018-07-24 22:36:15 Ouch!
Right, I know you’ve had a load of advice already, but I wanna put my tuppence in 
Don’t bandage it. Get yourself some pure coconut oil. It will soothe it, help it heal and most importantly it’ll draw out bacteria, and stop you getting an infection. 
Don’t pick it!
667 2018-07-24 22:35:59 finally got to buy my oil facial cleanser, sheet masks, got chatime for later tonight and went to pick up my sephora package. me —> is happy
668 2018-07-24 22:35:55 Joking, right? Hillary: allowed sale of 20% of our uranium to Russia. Trump puts screws to Iran who just made 4 billion oil deal with/ Russia. sanctions them, gives missles to Ukrane, told Germany: buy gas from us, not Russia.  You either already know this &  or you're ignorant.
669 2018-07-24 22:35:42 @bipzz either that or castor oil,which would you choose?
670 2018-07-24 22:35:40 Shiid I’m always running to the beauty supply store to get a different color durag, some oil or something. We need that!!

672 2018-07-24 22:35:26 Retweeted Peter Zeihan (@PeterZeihan):

Which means the Iran oil issue and the trade sanctions issue get conflated with the most powerful tool in the American economic arsenal already ready in Trump’s hand.
if I was Xi I would be terrified what is going to happen in December.
673 2018-07-24 22:35:25 Go to the oil fields. There is alot of money to be made right now.
674 2018-07-24 22:35:21 is anyone well versed in the iranian oil conflicts of the mid 1900s
675 2018-07-24 22:35:13 James ‘let’s ignore nuance’ Cleverly quite shrewdly neglects to mention that this inflation rate is down to a capitalist caused oil price crash and an economic war waged on Venezuela by the US, as well as the right wing in the country, which, when last in power, killed thousands.
676 2018-07-24 22:35:05 Summer and summer classes do not mix. Like oil and water
677 2018-07-24 22:35:02 パックをBOXで買って開封するのが好きなだけですよー。むかーしむかしは、やってましたけどww
678 2018-07-24 22:34:17 I’m super excited about the Bouqs subscription and the white truffle oil  men don’t need to know about these things..... might need to consider a smores maker though. That sounds very important.
679 2018-07-24 22:34:14 There was this viral tweet about how pretty people cant do math and it haunts me.

America...less angels and snake oil...more math.
680 2018-07-24 22:34:13 um sugar self raising flower, cocoa powder n probably oil idk how much we have
681 2018-07-24 22:34:04 Flax seeds + 1 whole Anaheim pepper + 1/2 red onion + 1 tomato + 1 Serrano pepper + (or spice pepper of choice) + generous amt of extra virgin olive oil + garlic salt + paprika + spicy taco seasoning + black pepper + cumin + fresh dill to top it off
682 2018-07-24 22:33:42 I do not like #oil...yes...I know we need it but it does not feed the hungry....causes great and dreadful #dramah...we re-negotiate the price...65? Or is that 60$? Mmmm
683 2018-07-24 22:33:39 Have you ever had chili oil? A spoon full will certainly wake you up...! Or knock you down.
684 2018-07-24 22:33:31 Why is oil so expensive
685 2018-07-24 22:33:19 I’m married pls..I dont need oil

689 2018-07-24 22:33:01 Gotta get this oil chance and I’m there
690 2018-07-24 22:33:00 You’re a snake oil salesman trying to warp people’s minds.Reality doesn’t exist for this man only his fabricated propaganda. Think about it people whether you’re a trumpster or not what kind of president tells the people to not believe what they see and hear!
691 2018-07-24 22:32:58 なるほどワールドカップ興味なさすぎて知らんかった
692 2018-07-24 22:32:57 montana's arguments were basic and first level. if that is all the oil industry has got, they got a problem cause they can hire better.
693 2018-07-24 22:32:51 Unexpected evening off, home alone.. I’m stopping by @JWebbWine for a bottle, then eating oil & vinegar w bread for dinner #andnoonecanstopme
694 2018-07-24 22:32:47 Oh the Singer is a nice looking car...I hadn't seen one before.  I did get to test drive a Camaro while my car was getting an oil change. They seemed impressed that I uh...test *drove* it.  It was nice.
695 2018-07-24 22:32:43 @CNNPolitics After the Mexican wall,distribution And the destroy of families by the name of immigration law, the United States fears the Iranians oil
696 2018-07-24 22:32:42 Oil prices was a global issue, coal miners, rail workers, lorry drivers, and fire services striking for working rights and to stop thier pay being further cut due to mass inflation measures was completely a localised UK issue.
697 2018-07-24 22:32:38 How about we say no to foreign oil and put more effort into cars that run on renewable energy and public transit?

I'd like my hypothetical grandkids to have a planet to inherit.
698 2018-07-24 22:32:37 We’ve heard the Socialist “solution” to Climate Change.

Vilify anyone involved in fossil fuels in the US, covertly move industries to low regulation zones and sweatshops the far end of bunker oil fired shipping lanes, result: Debt. 410 ppm. “Muh Science”.

Time for a fresh look!
699 2018-07-24 22:32:35 Going to get this oil change and I’ll be there
700 2018-07-24 22:32:34 I guess everyone that doesn’t buy Elon Musk’s story is a shill for the oil industry
701 2018-07-24 22:32:32 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*
702 2018-07-24 22:32:06 U realize the embargo excuse is passe? There r many exemptions to embargo; Cuba trades w rest of world; got billions from soviets and then cheap oil from Venezuela. Cuba is a failed economy on their own. PR? Bluntly? Corrupt govt dependency.
703 2018-07-24 22:32:00 I want to see it skyrocket into the stratosphere. Oil price moderation is not a climate solution. We need to get off fossil fuel infrastructure yesterday, as the last two weeks of temperatures attest.
704 2018-07-24 22:31:55 I imagine historians/ investigative reporters are burning the midnight oil to keep up with daily events. Never ever anything even close to this bizarre Presidency. The rapid pace of lies, financial conflicts, intellectual deficit, fire and fury tweets boggles the mind. Exhausting
705 2018-07-24 22:31:46 Do you stock rosemary essential oil?
706 2018-07-24 22:31:26 Love #ClaireDames! her scene with @manuelferrara for @EvilAngelVideo when she is covered in oil and anal cums wearing red thigh #boots is amazing. background video for more than one hot sex session...
707 2018-07-24 22:31:00 Exactly! Out of that loyalty to his boss and his Oil investments, for good reasons, Larry started criticising and outright attacking Tesla, SpaceX, Elon, the cult, lemmings etc. all to the degree of calling people names...repetitively.
And now out of that same loyalty he quits?
708 2018-07-24 22:30:58 Oh but let's help farmers, big oil, big pharma, banks etc. Disgusting Trump and Gop.
709 2018-07-24 22:30:41 Thanks for the reply. Do you currently have any other investment ideas outside of oil/tesla?
710 2018-07-24 22:30:37 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
711 2018-07-24 22:30:35 Because #gasoline prices are up, the average Washington household will pay $149 more in fuel costs this summer. We don’t want to see the price of oil get any more expensive.
712 2018-07-24 22:30:29 I say do it...defund all those except for the states who want those agencies have the states who want those protections make a list (socialists love registration) then start deporting those people out of the state..be sure to keep them together!

714 2018-07-24 22:30:21 I'm at an oil change place and they said my car doesn't have an engine air filter. So either the guy I got it from forgot to put one in or this place is trying to scam me.
715 2018-07-24 22:30:12 Hope my oil in the mail
716 2018-07-24 22:30:05 Le Oil est bien sur intentionnel...  faudrait pas qu'il manque de petrol hahn
717 2018-07-24 22:30:02 Hahaha hi baby aw hahaha

719 2018-07-24 22:29:50 Too bad baby oil doesn't come from trees.
720 2018-07-24 22:29:27 Again? What in the flying f*** is wrong with the Republican Party? You’re cool when you win... oil is oil? F***ing do something like a patriot would, like a politician that serves her constituents and the constitution would.

726 2018-07-24 22:28:24 Oil n all lol
727 2018-07-24 22:28:04 You could if you reduced the international trading value of the USD and we began exporting both goods to other countries using our mfg base (eg. US Cars to Germany) and more cheaply produced Oil and Gas due to the labor arbitrage...   as an example.
728 2018-07-24 22:27:54 Na Palm Oil we dey sell no be groundnut Oil
729 2018-07-24 22:27:46 Just hydrate your face as you normally would! For our oil, I let it drip down both sides of my face and massage it in.
730 2018-07-24 22:27:45 We just letting them know the chef is fry the fish and chicken in the same oil
731 2018-07-24 22:27:44 Hope that New Prime Minister must Focus over #R&D in #Oil&CleanEnergy, #Secularism #AdvancedPakistan to Compete with G8
732 2018-07-24 22:27:41 Funny that my mom use to be against smoking, now she asks to hit my oil pen when I come visit
733 2018-07-24 22:27:33 Except with lower heavy oil prices the frac spread makes refining heavy oil more profitable and actually produces more high value products. You can't have a firm purchase contracts to buy oil from a pipeline that doesn't exist, and may never exist unless laws are enforced.

735 2018-07-24 22:27:12 PSA: if you're soaking chicken which is supposed to go into hot oil after, make sure it's VERY DRY first. I forgot to do that. Both myself and my kitchen are now covered in a thin layer of oil.
736 2018-07-24 22:26:55 Girl the trick is jojoba oil. Rub it in your cuticles 3 times a day
737 2018-07-24 22:26:55 America: The Quest for Oil
738 2018-07-24 22:26:48 buybacks are always a good indicator what companies think the future oil prices will be, I wonder if they are doing the some buybacks this year which would mean they expect oil prices to go up even more
739 2018-07-24 22:26:36 using a superior product would not cause that. unless the vehicle is pre-1980; the composition of gaskets could have been affected by synthetic oil.

I wouldn't go breaking any jaws...
740 2018-07-24 22:26:36 Don’t talk to me about coconut oil and expect me NOT to fall in love with you
741 2018-07-24 22:26:07 King Arthur all purpose flour. Salt and pepper. Chopped fresh rosemary. Dip in egg first, and flour generously. Fry in hot olive oil.
742 2018-07-24 22:26:07 Also it's pretty much 100% certain that if western capitalist countries are still running the world in 2100ish when these projections come to fruition, they will still be extracting oil and natural gas and relying on those just as extensively as solar and nuclear
743 2018-07-24 22:26:06 It would be just around 2% the long term TRENDLINE. Debt has increased a lot which is a drag on the efficiency of the economy. Tax cut to the Rich will not produce more jobs. Wages after inflation is going down in the last 3 Qr. Don't peddle snake oil, please!
744 2018-07-24 22:26:00 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
745 2018-07-24 22:25:59 Another  snack is: cut your avocado into pieces, drizzle olive oil across the cut up chunks, and then sprinkle the lime juice on top as well. Eat with a fork or on a triscuit.
746 2018-07-24 22:25:55 Avocado. Monterrey Jack. Rosemary and olive oil mini bruschettinis. Pinot grigio. Momma's home
747 2018-07-24 22:25:54 There was an old saying during the gas shortage of years ago.  We can burn our wheat, let them eat their oil. We do have a very large oil reserve. 
748 2018-07-24 22:25:51 Hey u should try to use cannabis oil to get sober really you have a ENDOCANNABINOID system if used right can help ya get sober off a plant not a drug
749 2018-07-24 22:25:46 All y'all Americans love the sound of oil.
750 2018-07-24 22:25:26 Some got gold and oil and diamonds - all we got is Mary J.
751 2018-07-24 22:25:20 He was a shill for the oil industry
752 2018-07-24 22:25:14 Nothing scary or crazy going on. The United States has gigantic masses of untapped oil yet, but regulations and economic pressures are keeping it underground to hold the prices high.
753 2018-07-24 22:25:06 I’m very old school. Queen Helene Mint Julep mask is my go to! It draws oil out of pores better than anything else I’ve ever tried!
754 2018-07-24 22:24:39 Dear @RachelNotley @JustinTrudeau et al: Your plan to build more pipelines and increase oil production is contributing to this crisis. Why, when the scientists and earth herself are showing you facts? It makes zero sense. Stupid leadership.
755 2018-07-24 22:24:15 Went to the salon and the best thing she recommended was put in any leave in conditioner while your hair is wet, use eco styler gel with Argan oil, then use a Denman brush to disperse the product. It’s amazing 
756 2018-07-24 22:24:11 I won’t tell but the guy in the suit that walked out after me w a quart of olive oil and four perfect apricots in a clear bag may have beat me.
757 2018-07-24 22:24:10 Is it too late to get a shirt I can wear when I change the oil in my car?
758 2018-07-24 22:24:10 If it were the marines I'd say that they thought it was the delivery boy that made their pies, but seeing as it's an Army base they probably thought he was filled with oil.
759 2018-07-24 22:24:04 Yes babe! Use whatever essential oil you want but I love orange because it’s gentle enough for the face when diluted and seriously brings out a glow so it makes your butt look smooth, too!
760 2018-07-24 22:23:48 So because of trumps brilliant business acumen we will be paying extra on goods imported and also subsidizing the big agribusinesses that voted him in.  Not to mention that oil prices are going to spike.  Some tax cut for the people
761 2018-07-24 22:23:43 This tan and coconut oil is all the make up I need. 
762 2018-07-24 22:23:31 I use moroccanoil blow out cream/oil on mine.
763 2018-07-24 22:23:25 Let me amend this...

"for Oil I will sacrifice my blood, my sweat, my life." 

God bless America
764 2018-07-24 22:23:16 .@JoeNBC PLEASE talk about Zinke et al drilling for oil in Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.  Wildlife Refuge!!  AND, in Bears Ears in Utah.  WTF??  Also gutting the Endangered Species Act.  Hideous corrupt people.
765 2018-07-24 22:23:15 You'd be surprised.  Fax is everywhere.  It hasn't gone the way of whale oil lamps yet.  Advertisers send jillions of junk faxes every single day.
766 2018-07-24 22:23:10 He's refined a persona of objective commentator while cherry picking data and studiously avoiding the abundant evidence that challenges what he's selling. 

Trust me, he is *selling*, and it's snake oil. Watch the numpties nod along while he herds them into the echo chamber. Meh!
767 2018-07-24 22:23:10 Michelle needs to move on, look to future relationships, as Trump has forcefully said “He does not want me as his enemy”. Negative public speeches, shaming  does not move ball forward. . NoKo, Oil, assurances to peace and De Nuclearizatio. 90% still owned by US-Russia
768 2018-07-24 22:23:06 Dear Sea Shepherd @seashepherd ,
Please stop selling products with palm oil.  It makes no sense to save whales if you have to kill an orangutan or poison an elephant to do it.
769 2018-07-24 22:23:05 You're a genius! It was the dill, sea salt & olive oil triscuits so I just added extra sea salt on top of the cado because I'm a sodium kweeeen hahahaha

We don't have Pepsi, will motor oil work?
772 2018-07-24 22:22:41 This is one of the three oils that my hair does not get excited about, along with coconut and believe it or not, jojoba. I can't use Almond because of my tree nut allergy so thank goodness for grape seed oil.
773 2018-07-24 22:22:15 seaweed oil balancing mask from the body shop or pretty much anything from lush, glamglow and tony moly
774 2018-07-24 22:22:14 Imagine if car ins paid for tires n oil change n wash n wax jobs.
775 2018-07-24 22:22:13 while I wait all night, for you,
in California,
watching the fox pick off my goldfish
from their sorry, golden state —
and I am no longer
afraid of anything, save
the life that, here, awaits.
I don't belong to anyone.
My heart is heavy as an oil drum.
I don't want to be alone.

778 2018-07-24 22:21:46 I had the olive oil on the bottom of my pasta bowl and there were red pepper flakes in it and,,,,,,,, my throat has burned away
779 2018-07-24 22:21:42 Tesla is expanding into commercial transportation with its Semi, and Level 5 FSD will cut into oil demand across all demand segments. My primary way of betting on higher oil prices is TSLA, although still have some ESV/NE/RIG as well. HAL, I think is good too at $40.
780 2018-07-24 22:21:37 Finally got my oil changed I no longer have no bitches and am no longer swagless
781 2018-07-24 22:21:29 I’m abt to drain my oil so I can slide thru 
782 2018-07-24 22:21:24 i have been driving on a flat tire for months now and was supposed to get an oil change like 3000 miles ago and i have yet to do anything about either one of those things and at this point in my life i’m hoping my tire falls off and my engine explodes
783 2018-07-24 22:21:22 What a crock of crap!   DJT is the worst snake oil salesman we've ever seen.
784 2018-07-24 22:21:20 American media is ramping up the war machine again. Preparing the American people for another bogus proxy war that will only make the rich happy with more oil and mineral rights.
785 2018-07-24 22:21:13 Yep, midnight on 31st of December 1973 the Goverment start a 3 day week caused by a lack of electricity, due to oil price, miners strikes and other issues. Over 800,000 people lose thier jobs, they even ration TV broadcasting and the BBC shuts off after 10pm every night.
786 2018-07-24 22:21:07 Lol  so those noise makers couldn't even win anything?  Soar like an eagle & never get  tired. Ur oil will never run dry.
787 2018-07-24 22:21:06 Took my car in for an oil change. They caused $300 worth of damage. What the fuck.
788 2018-07-24 22:20:48 It’s only a sad 38 percentage follow the money and the lies this is all a smoke screen for a future real estate empire in Russia and Putin gets the Ukraine oil

792 2018-07-24 22:19:59 Is Popeye's Chicken fried in Olive Oil ? Inquiring minds need to know.
793 2018-07-24 22:19:54 "Oil shill".....  That's funny.   Do you understand where electricity comes from?   Why do you think oil companies SUPPORT EV's?   Clearly you can't do the math-  EV's are the greatest thing to happen to oil companies in decades.  Retard.....
794 2018-07-24 22:19:49 I like pairing them but if you had to get one or the other definitely the lip oil

796 2018-07-24 22:19:36 There is so much oil in my shoes that you could light them on fire and take out a tank with them.
797 2018-07-24 22:19:23 I need a oil change anybody know how to do it???
798 2018-07-24 22:19:18 @ChrisDanielShow any of the Tornados from 7 eleven. And the "steak" and cheese chimichangas from most stop and robs that are deep fried in that ageless oil
799 2018-07-24 22:19:01 There’s a difference between socialist democracy and socialist dictator. Venezuela was rich because of oil, and the leaders didn’t invest that money wisely. France, UK, Canada, etc seem to be doing fine. Regardless of your economic system you need smart wise leadership.

811 2018-07-24 22:18:06 Chris is being disingenuous. It's not the low ratings that disincentivize him from covering it, it's the giant oil companies like Exxon that literally fund MSNBC through advertising. He can't go after them if he wants to keep his job. It's personal survival for him.
812 2018-07-24 22:18:02 Y’all niggas on here with all this “be faithful advice “ but jus told yo baby mama you gotta get a oil change but you bussin down the shorty who wash dishes at Wendy’s in yo baby mama car.
813 2018-07-24 22:17:55 Think about this, your kids grow up, join the military to “defend freedom” yet we allow our southern neighbors to be tortured by cartel terrorists and we do nothing because our military is REALLY in the Middle East fighting for oil and opium, not freedom. #wakeup #resist

816 2018-07-24 22:17:35 Interesting this time they specifically talked about in Houston is important to have #5G for Industrial players, they may be targeting something with Oil companies.
817 2018-07-24 22:17:31 Literally oil was leaking in the engine and ruined her whole car. LMAO.

819 2018-07-24 22:17:05 The highway, byway to #Energy, policies of profiteering, and the #Power Rush. Present and future, considering PR’s utility infrastructure needs + NY’s #bistate oil, #CPV natural gas pipelines, networked plans. This entire grid must be ‘pressured’ journalistically. Excellent read.
820 2018-07-24 22:16:55 the most relevant factor in isolation, in predicting oil demand? It seems like the answer would be more multifaceted, and I have seen some projections demonstrating that even with very optimistic rates of EV adoption, oil demand increase attributable to ICE use, would continue
821 2018-07-24 22:16:55 Proportionality clause in #nafta compels us to sell the oil to the Americans.

If there is overseas buyers, where are the contracts?

America in conjunction with Bayern’s, Man City’s, Barca’s initiatives to set up academies on American soil is that THERES OIL HERE. #GetDrilling
827 2018-07-24 22:15:53 Insulin, antibiotics and tins of spam- all melting and going rotten. Vast warehouses or stockpiled blood plasma, statins, dried egg, bull semen, palm oil and soya protein oozing out towards the White Cliffs accompanied by the drone of a Merlin engine and a Clapham Omnibus..
828 2018-07-24 22:15:48 He put it on his hands then washed them. It is hard to get rid of all traces of oil down a sink. If it really was Novichok of course.
829 2018-07-24 22:15:48 Nag aala highlighter yung oil ko sa muka 
830 2018-07-24 22:15:20 Sorry, did I miss the conversation? We were about to enter the three-day week due to soaring oil prices.

835 2018-07-24 22:14:39 Snake Oil hands down. It's super fun! Also, sushi go
836 2018-07-24 22:14:26 @ValueAnalyst1 are you adding to any more oil names recently, besides ESV and noble? And given that only a minority of oil use has been stated as being attributed to consumer transportation, do you still the rate of electric vehicle adoption (if that is your position), as being
837 2018-07-24 22:14:01 ppl said they breathed and the engagement was over im glad we say by that kitchen oil can instead of going inside ahjxhd
838 2018-07-24 22:14:00 My dad is a genius. He used to take apart radios and TVs when he was little to figure out how they work. More recently he converted a little Mazda Miata into an electric car that he charged with solar power. He also converted a truck into 100% biodiesel, ran on used cooking oil.
839 2018-07-24 22:13:35 Sanctions, expelled diplomats, Russia’s main Middle East ally Iran being neutralized and hit with sanctions, becoming #1 oil exporter in the world, etc

Actions speak louder than tweets. Dems & their allies like Merkel’s actions are opposite of their rhetoric: Very pro-Russian.

842 2018-07-24 22:12:51 I just cried at a Dawn Dish Soap commercial. This is getting out of hand. (To be fair they were washing animals that were victims of an oil spill, but still. A DAWN COMMERCIAL?) #iminaglasscaseofemotion

850 2018-07-24 22:12:05 I can't say for certain, but I think the answer to this problem was determined to either be coconut oil or healing crystals.
851 2018-07-24 22:11:50 Can you imagine an adult coach/mentor telling a teenage kid that he can be elite (top 7%) without hard work, commitment  and sacrifice? That message is simply not compatible with life success, in anything.  Can’t believe parents fall for the snake oil pitch.
852 2018-07-24 22:11:47 i love the fries.!!! what’s with the fry hate? u used to the frozen fries and now u hit with real fries unfrozen/fresh it’s not what u used to! like people who love velvetta (oil) and hate melted cheese!!!  
853 2018-07-24 22:11:40 Just realized I have to use my whole paycheck this week to pay for rent, an oil change and internet and that made me very sad
854 2018-07-24 22:11:20 While blockchain startups race to tokenize everything from oil reserves to money, the glaringly obvious hasn’t been attempted: Tokenizing People. #Tokenaire $AIRE
855 2018-07-24 22:11:19 Always feel as though you’re burning the midnight oil? Get yourself an academic planner and spend a few hours planning for the month ahead.
856 2018-07-24 22:11:12 I always thought it was the oil temp that did this, like it wasn’t hot enough. Damn so should i not be using corn starch in my chicken dredge for optimal crispness?! Lmao
857 2018-07-24 22:10:59 sponsor me pls race oil hurting my pockets @YamalubeUSA
858 2018-07-24 22:10:53 Today was fun, I was a model for my bff, she’s taking an eyelash extensions course. She did well today. Tonight consist of food, tv, tea with a drop of hemp oil and sleep. 
859 2018-07-24 22:10:21 ... if you can make gazpacho with ice is one of the best things to eat when hot. Tomatoes, cucumber, garlic, olive oil and salt. Put it together in a blender with some ice and voilà!
860 2018-07-24 22:10:21 also he said the scent of olive oil & herbs on me is more intoxicating than perfume 
861 2018-07-24 22:10:15 Can you suggest a CBD oil in the States for anxiety?

865 2018-07-24 22:09:48 Got a selection of fine breads with some nice oil that hasn't been fucked yet to dip it into
866 2018-07-24 22:09:37 They would find a way of blaming WM. after all, some of them are still whingeing about oil.
867 2018-07-24 22:09:24 Relax, Trump is President 
868 2018-07-24 22:09:18 Is 400 calories of oil, a thing?
869 2018-07-24 22:09:11 Just eat healthy girl.  Add more salads to your diet,  reduce the carbs, oil and sugar.  I lost over 100 pounds easy and I ate 6 meals a day and only did some yoga/cardio.
870 2018-07-24 22:08:56 Now how do we put it to good use? It's still cheaper to extract oil from the ground and make plastic than convert these to usable material. We should be banking this stuff like China is doing with all materials until the tech comes around. Were pretty much a closed ecosystem.
871 2018-07-24 22:08:49 こいつはやだ(´・ω・｀)
872 2018-07-24 22:08:38 Things I’ve learned as a stupid young person living alone: fires happen not that rarely but dealing w it is usually painless (and the fault of a burning crumb or oil or smth)
873 2018-07-24 22:08:38 You know what isn't magic? Oil burns to the damn crotch
874 2018-07-24 22:08:30 Just watched my Mawmaw give her dog hemp oil. Wtf

879 2018-07-24 22:07:48 Earlier I was gonna teach my brothers how to change my oil. So we go to the store to get some oil. Why my brother look at me and go, “We looking for diesel right?” When I tell y’all I died laughing.
880 2018-07-24 22:07:12 Second on the CBD oil!! Look into it
881 2018-07-24 22:07:09 "I felt like putting a bullet between the eyes of every Panda that wouldn't screw to save its species, I wanted to open the dump valves on oil tankers and smother all the French beaches I'd never see. I wanted to breathe smoke.. I felt like destroying something beautiful"
882 2018-07-24 22:06:58 I rubbed coconut oil all over my dog and now he’s feeling himself 
883 2018-07-24 22:06:48 @mitch__lowe I can not fathom why you would align yourself with the snake oil salesman that is Ted Farnsworth. I would have stayed FAR FAR away if your credibility wasn't attached. Congratulations. Your reputation has now been destroyed.
884 2018-07-24 22:06:44 Also, if the US disallows Iran to sell their oil that means Russia will be able to sell more Russian oil. Could that be something that was promised in the closed door meeting?
885 2018-07-24 22:06:44 Coconut oil works too
886 2018-07-24 22:06:38 Oh no, that wasn't paint. That thing broke while swimming in shock oil and it still was so tight that THAT happened before it would budge.

2) +/- 40 years of known oil reserves left in the world!.
3) Sasol is a CTL (coal to liquid) producer. 

why are we still importing 70% of our crude oil if we can make it here?

890 2018-07-24 22:06:21 Political education especially in the rurals is essential. These people are victims of compensatory power in the form of mealies, cooking oil, etc. Their dire situations allow them to be bait for the Zanu predators.

896 2018-07-24 22:05:37 They are exaggerating the potential risk to justify spending that should already be taking place if they were doing a proper job. Consider our lack of strategic oil and gas reserves. The lowest in Europe. Same should apply to basic foodstuffs. Who knows when it will be needed.
897 2018-07-24 22:05:34 Mr. Offerman, Vets are, by in large, not dumb enough to fall for snake oil salesman pitches. We f*&#in hate this blue falcon. (Blue Falcon=Buddy F^%$er)

902 2018-07-24 22:05:09 I filled an Ulta cart full of crap bc I wanted the skincare stuff they were giving away if you spent $50 and then they emptied my cart so I refilled it and then the sale ended 

So I went over to Sephora instead. Was really wanting to try out @tartecosmetics maracuja oil tho

905 2018-07-24 22:04:59 And the same people eating a burger from this cow will see a bird covered in oil from a spill and start to cry.
906 2018-07-24 22:04:57 As soon as they realized that coal/oil were to blame for a lot of CC problems, they changed their tune, and blamed it on @algore. Made them look so foolish to anyone with a brain. That’s what lost me from republicans, when they left CC behind, and started the war on the poor.

908 2018-07-24 22:04:35 @MeghanMcCain crying about taxes to pay for evil socialist programs (like foodstamps), is perfectly okay w/our taxes for corporate welfare, oil subsidies, zero-interest loans, tax cuts for billionaires, etc.Just making the wealthy pay their FAIR share wud easily fund social pgms.

923 2018-07-24 22:02:31 Put foil in a pan. Medium heat. Oil in pan. Start skin side down and keep a close eye on it so it doesn’t get stuck to the bottom. Spatula or tongs to lift it up a bunch. After about 5-7 minutes depending on size, flip it for 5 minutes then eat it.

932 2018-07-24 22:00:53 Try some emulsified MCT oil in your coffee (via @Onnit or similar)! Technically you could blend it with cannabis oil and it would probably be insanely good! @AubreyMarcus would know.
933 2018-07-24 22:00:47 Plus the corruption, Meghan. Who did they sell out their oil interests to. Who bought the Citgo debt and to whom was it sold ? There's a lot more to Venezuela than socialism.

938 2018-07-24 22:00:23 NDP doesn't understand how the economy works. Oil has been on a six month run. That is why the economy is up in spite of poor economic policy. With a $.075 dollar and $70 oil we should be able to balance the budget.

940 2018-07-24 22:00:14 In restaurants, they use salt to absorb oil spills. I wonder if the kind of rock salt they use on streets to melt snow & ice would be bad for runways?
941 2018-07-24 21:59:47 In 1999 President BClinton illegally sold Alaskan crude to China in violation of the agreement allowing domestic oil exploration and development. We sold it at $16.00 barrel. THEN he GAVE them our top secret anti-cavitation sub screw technology that made our subs invisible.

948 2018-07-24 21:58:48 LMANSJSJSJ the salon I’m in rn has this birthday special (either the same day or in this week) for hot oil treatment or a trim for free and all you need is I.D. Bitch my birthday is Friday lmao lesgedittttt I need a trim anyway 
949 2018-07-24 21:58:45 We should leave Iran alone we need to stop starting trouble in the Middle East and everywhere this is all about oil profits & control the oil like you hinted at this is just Tramp &  GOP way of distracting from the fiscal mess they created with Tax cuts jobs(haha) Act & tariffs
950 2018-07-24 21:58:40 And in oil too, I’m glad you like it
951 2018-07-24 21:58:29 To get oil and resources for the government?
952 2018-07-24 21:58:10 Sorry but no also,. It really only floods in Napa  up here. I'm against gas/oil pipelines too though.  They will site reasons that aren't relevant we can handle the water up here. Desalinate down there.
953 2018-07-24 21:58:02 Oil oil oil
954 2018-07-24 21:57:39 Mummy will never answer you because she was a real total failure and spoiled that ministry headed. She was just follow follow for one useless old man from Ogun state which lack electoral vaule and award Oil block to sex partners, may be she was also among the beneficiaries
955 2018-07-24 21:57:38 depending on what kind of toner you use it tightens your pores and cleanses or nurtures your skin -  are you using an oil free moisturizer:C
956 2018-07-24 21:56:47 Everett, to another boy in the TOYOTA Kids Club (waiting for oil change): “Ooh! A pink ball! I love pink! Did you know boys can like pink, and girls can like blue?”
957 2018-07-24 21:56:43 Please, & don’t get played. A full oil change should also come with oil filter, air filter & tire air check. If they talk you into synthetic it’ll be more expensive but not $70 more expensive.
958 2018-07-24 21:56:33 You should put it in the garbage because it's snake oil
959 2018-07-24 21:56:27 @walmart your customer service from 2220 NJ-27, Edison, NJ 08817 really sucks. Went to change the oil on my car at 5pm and it closes at 7. They couldn’t help me because the techs were going home at 5pm and they couldn’t help me. Her response was “what do you want me to do?”...
960 2018-07-24 21:56:21 Why are you engaging in religious persecution? Cannabis is a key component of the most sacred anointing oil (Chrism) used by Jesus for healing purposes. Recipe comes directly from God. Who do you think is going to win this war? 
961 2018-07-24 21:56:06 Was there in 2014 in late Oct. need to go back for warmer ocean temps. The sea was still clean and magnificent. Bought some pretty good olive oil!
962 2018-07-24 21:56:04 I need a well oil pool man and some ice tea lmao
963 2018-07-24 21:56:03 Who are these mysterious petroleum interests? Oh that's right. It's you. And me. And everyone you see at the gas station. In other words everyone. America needs America's oil.
964 2018-07-24 21:55:56 Wondering is that a diff vape cart you're using for the CO, or are both distillate and CO2 oil using the same size intake..and have you tried different hole sizes to see if there was much of a diff.
965 2018-07-24 21:55:55 crap, they're going to literally boil him in legal oil. I doubt trump will skate out of this self imposed legal quagmire. I guess fair and square does actually apply to politics..
966 2018-07-24 21:55:51 (Diluted) Tea tree oil and use Indian healing clay as a mask. Don’t add as much ACV it might aggravate it more. Black soap doesn’t work for everyone.
967 2018-07-24 21:55:48 Omg  time to get some cbd oil
968 2018-07-24 21:55:22 Venezuela. If by "economic war" you actually mean "buying all the oil it can sell".
969 2018-07-24 21:55:05 Use organic coconut oil with brown sugar. Exfoliate. Wash with warm water. Then dab organic coconut oil onto skin, sleep with it over night. 
Your skin will thank you.
970 2018-07-24 21:54:42 I agree. Former migraine sufferer. 
Another great and easy product is a roll on oil applied to temples and hairline called Past Tense by dōTerra (online!). It really works. Great line that helps me w/o wrecking organs!
971 2018-07-24 21:54:37 China and others will buy that oil
972 2018-07-24 21:54:13 Laziness will ruin your life. You can’t  be lazy concerning your family life, your friendships, career, side hustles, your classes, your bills, your skin care regimen, your oil changes, your taxes... anything. Laziness will ruin your life.
973 2018-07-24 21:54:03 Tru but also if u can have banambos or apel sos u can use that as an alternative to oil

976 2018-07-24 21:53:29 Dark money from right wing US groups and Big Oil. Those would be my guesses.

978 2018-07-24 21:52:54 Curious isn’t it - like Britain and Norway had North Sea Oil. One had a one trillion dollar wealth fund - the other a two trillion dollar debt. Where did it all go? Certainly not into infrastructure and schools and hospitals.
979 2018-07-24 21:52:32 Hopefully never. The man is snake oil salesman He has published precisely zero about his "theories" on climate. A nincompoop of the highest order.
980 2018-07-24 21:52:31 Does beard oils and moisturizes containing unrefined jojoba and pure argan oil fall under this category?
981 2018-07-24 21:52:27 True given that China & India are currently top two buyers of Iranian Oil; US blocked Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline ensuring most oil or gas flows through Persian Gulf where US & allies maintain a physical supply stranglehold in addition to measures like CAATSA.
982 2018-07-24 21:52:18 Argan Oil is great for fine lines, use at night
983 2018-07-24 21:52:16 Tons of games are guilty of this. They make gold a strong armor or weapon when it's actually a weak metal.
Although I don't think any game can beat Xenoblade Chronicles in the armor logic department, where body cream/oil sometimes offers more protection than armor.
984 2018-07-24 21:52:15 It's Not just Sex tapes!
It's Big Oil deals, Big Arms deals, & real estate money laundering, Where Trumps & Jared are taking a piece of the pie, thru Cohen, &
tax evasion, controlling the stock market and espionage.
The World will be in Shock at the extent of their Greed.
985 2018-07-24 21:52:14 Man! Thank you so much for that extra $2.46 in my pocket. Now get the oil company’s to lower their prices and maybe I can get a full gallon of gas with it.
#whatajoke
986 2018-07-24 21:52:12 @fordnation @ONtransport Instead of making gas cheaper to 'help' the people. You should focus on reducing auto insurance rate and also cell phone plans instead of incentivizing oil and gas industry while discriminating @tesla and other green players. Billions in damage for future
987 2018-07-24 21:52:05 I ate yam and red oil for the first time in a long ass time and guess what, yam and red oil is still bae

992 2018-07-24 21:51:19 @TuckerGoodrich Hi Tucker, hope the Ketofest was fun! I have a question, have you looked at Argan Oil that is used mainly in Mediterranean countries of Morocco and Egypt? I use it a fair bit when cooking Tagines. My daughter did a cooking class in Marrakesh and that is THE oil!
993 2018-07-24 21:51:18 Che ha detto oil of tuna stasera ??
994 2018-07-24 21:51:15 I make a scrub out of coffee grounds with coconut oil and orange essential oil, the caffeine and moisture helps with my cellulite a lot.

998 2018-07-24 21:50:35 We’ve bailed out the banking system. We’ll bail out the farmers next. Aren’t we bailing out coal now and the oil industry as well? Or at least trying to keep a dying coal industry alive?
999 2018-07-24 21:50:17 also oil changes & buying trash bags.
1000 2018-07-24 21:50:11 Watching the BBC and I guess Russia has the backing of America. 

Lawsuits in Lithonia to counter lawsuits against them.

Advising Syria to buzz over Israel.

Suing Japanese companies over oil.

Putin's just smacking everybody.  Maybe he thinks America will back him up.

Re: Rahr family foundation, I see no evidence of oil/gas investing as you “reported” (w/out reference btw).  They do support hundreds of causes from Israel to @GlobalGreenUS. Care to support your claim of bias?

1011 2018-07-24 21:49:03 If USA is the world's largest oil producer, why do they buy oil that they have in abundance?

Any logical reason for this?
1012 2018-07-24 21:49:02 my car would never be overdue for an oil change if there was a giant green health diamond hovering over top like in The Sims
1013 2018-07-24 21:48:19 To me, giving a little love to ethanol producers isn’t entirely a stretch.  Oil lobby won’t like it but will they really vote Democrat - no chance and trump knows this.  I was hopeful on the Pruitt resignation but the new appointee first order of biz was ethanol negative too!
1014 2018-07-24 21:48:13 I truly wish I could articulate how unimportant that is. I wish I could articulate how ineffectual a company like Tesla is to big oil. I have no position in Tesla, but I find myself flabbergasted at the glaring, ominous, evidence that bulls refute. A shame when this goes BK.
1015 2018-07-24 21:48:09 Imma be late for my game fooling with these oil change people
1016 2018-07-24 21:48:01 Yeah, they don't talk about the people responsible for it, oil company CEOs, Saudis and others funding the denial industry, lobbying against oil regulations, etc. If covered that way, probably would get good ratings.

1022 2018-07-24 21:47:19 The sad thing is that this industry is also gaining a foothold in the south of England, but it's unconventional oil drilling rather than shale gas fracking. If the geology is favourable, nowhere is off limits unfortunately.

1024 2018-07-24 21:47:03 it would rate well if they covered it as a conspiracy of oil company CEOs and paid climate deniers out to destroy the planet for profit, but that would mean MSNBC being critical of giant corporations.
1025 2018-07-24 21:46:59 While sitting on the largest oil reserves in the world. Chased out all the engineers that could exploit those wells.
1026 2018-07-24 21:46:59 The problem is that the Federal gov has no right to say what an individual province can produce. And blocking a pipeline has no effect on how much oil is burned. So it’s either oil sands oil, or someone else’s oil that gets burned.
1027 2018-07-24 21:46:54 They are fighting many foreign oil projects. Get educated please.
1028 2018-07-24 21:46:53 Ještě, že tu ropu nemáme. Agrofert, divize oil a zas bychom měli 
1029 2018-07-24 21:46:52 Nobody is “defending Putin” like nobody defended Saddam in 2002. People see Trump:
- Occupies Syria
- increased NATO troops on Russia border
- sent US warships to Black Sea
- sent weapons to Ukraine
- sabotaged Russian oil deal
So they’re unconvinced on “collusion”. They’re right
1030 2018-07-24 21:46:35 Nobody is “defending Putin” like nobody defended Saddam in 2002. People see Trump:

1033 2018-07-24 21:46:21 It's time for Regime Change in Iran through economic sanctions. Tighten the noose! Cut off their oil exports!
1034 2018-07-24 21:46:14 The intent here is good. I dont agree with implementation of it either, 100%. It would seem better to gang up on Chi Coms with EU et al. How I would do it, but I'm not in charge. 
But then EU are not pure of heart either.
1035 2018-07-24 21:46:01 @RealDonad_Trump you better go back tomorrow the original Iran deal or sign one that benefits Iran cause oil is expected to hit $200 a barrel in the next few months. Means the economy will go into a recession or worse and you will be blamed.
1036 2018-07-24 21:45:53 おはようございます(*^^*)
1037 2018-07-24 21:45:53 Loooooool!!! Maybe I should check it out then  Kidding, I get enough of those on Insta  One guy sent me one with an oil painting in the background. Replied: dude! Do you live in a museum?!

1039 2018-07-24 21:45:47 So the # are in,. As expected., but from what I can see from the ground. There is a lot more not here. And the draw is much bigger... Concerning for overall economy.  High oil for extended time hurts all. Imho
1040 2018-07-24 21:45:41 "For seven months, NNPC did not remit any money into federation account. When I called as a sitting governor and major oil producing state, Deziani Alison Madueke refused to pick my calls."

1046 2018-07-24 21:44:48 cleared out my folk's pantry last year, found some pasta sauce mix from 1986. There was an unopened bottle of veg oil from '98 and it wasn't even the oldest one...

1048 2018-07-24 21:44:29 Rightttt! I guess I can stop w the one on my face cause I use vitamin e oil too, but deff not on my hair I’m just so shocked

1051 2018-07-24 21:44:12 Which nations interests?

England for Oil , border reivers for rat rustling , whisky raids , ginger repopulating , clean unfracked water?
1052 2018-07-24 21:44:12 Or, perhaps the cairn was significant to the builders of the oil terminal - the cairn came first you know...
1053 2018-07-24 21:44:10 This was pretty clear
"flows from the Peace River have decreased 9 percent, and flows from the Athabasca have decreased a whopping 26 percent. In these low waters, chemicals similar to those produced by the oil sands developments near the park are concentrating"
1054 2018-07-24 21:44:05 Don’t underestimate Ethiopia’s potentials. It has a lot to offer. Ex. Livestock, Goat meat, camel, Oxen, or Live animals, Coffee, Flower and vegetables, Oil seeds so much to offer. It is all about economy. Ethiopia needs help on this sector for greater trade.
1055 2018-07-24 21:44:01 I cook with this now.  It has a high flash point for frying. Also almond oil!
1056 2018-07-24 21:43:43 No oil tankers, no oil pipelines, no oil by rail.  Hmmm?
1057 2018-07-24 21:43:40 So not impressed. Burning the late night working oil to complete the BFR return and the form has just kicked me out. #SBLtwitter Head in hands moment 
1058 2018-07-24 21:43:31 You donated $14 million of your own money (stolen from Medicare) to your campaign, you also have shady PACs, Big Oil and NRA donations. Only being able to afford PT staffers doesn't mean Senator Nelson is dodging anything...other than being as corrupt as you are.
1059 2018-07-24 21:43:29 Your gonna give more #welfare for farmers because you are screejngnuo trade. You already give so@much #corporatewelfare via the #goptaxscam and oil and natural gas kickbacks. @SecretarySonny
1060 2018-07-24 21:43:23 The oil...as @JustinTrudeau @Bill_Morneau and @jimcarr_wpg have been crystal clear on, is for export not domestic use. Remember the $15B / Year @JustinTrudeau quotes we’re losing out on, by not putting it in an oil tanker and shipping it to the other side of the planet! I do!
1061 2018-07-24 21:43:22 .@EPAAWheeler tells reporters at EPA HQ that he’s working with ethanol and oil interests toward a new deal on RFS after the last one fell apart. ‘I think we can make everyone happy’

1063 2018-07-24 21:43:04 We do win most. We win 1 but in the meantime they have taken actions that warrant filing 10 more complaints. The fact is we are always behind the curve on this. They dont care because they benefit until they lose case. 
It's a cycle, so far no end in sight
1064 2018-07-24 21:42:56 and if my guess is correct, it likely means refiners are starting to cut back so oil imports plunged.

1083 2018-07-24 21:41:01 Yes sir, I know there’s no cure. I would just like a more definitive answer other than “Looks like ALS but so atypical”. And help relieving symptoms.
I have started using CBD oil. I feel that it is helping with both spasms & anxiety.
1084 2018-07-24 21:41:01 Our elected officials have to actually make it happen.  When they gave the oil sands 100Mt of our entire 2030 carbon budget (a budget that is not ambitious enough) they lost my trust. Especially since I've been paying high Ontario hydro rates to close those coal plants.

1095 2018-07-24 21:40:08 How many votes did the oil, gas and coal industries get?
1096 2018-07-24 21:40:03 .lol...nooo they are selling vegetable oil.

for invite!!
1102 2018-07-24 21:39:39 this is so true. I often wondered about this, like why the hell arent iranian ambassadors making deals from within america. the US gov wants that oil sooooo bad, deals could've been made easily. but then there's also history, and pride.
1103 2018-07-24 21:39:31 Oil company donors.
1104 2018-07-24 21:39:30 Lack of investment in solar and the continuation of the subsidies to the oil gas and coal Industries is the problem. We’ve had major nuclear accidents in the last 50 years. I don’t see us getting better at prevention.
1105 2018-07-24 21:39:27 Pouring oil on the fire is not the way to quench it. ：
1106 2018-07-24 21:39:27 No to any creams with nut oil in like almonds or  even hand soaps.

1110 2018-07-24 21:38:51 I feel responsible, for once. 
I fixed almost all of my school shit
And i gave my car the oil change it needed but here i am a broke asf and without sewoons album rip.
1111 2018-07-24 21:38:50 What's really nice is slicing them into discs, putting salt and pepper, and pan-frying (or roasting) them in a bit of butter or olive oil
1112 2018-07-24 21:38:45 My dad is convinced concentrated palm oil will heal my pilonidal cyst. I believe
1113 2018-07-24 21:38:31 One used to pull in and the attendant would pump your gas, wash your windshield, and check your oil (if you wanted). This has totally ceased to be the case. Once in a great while, you'll get an attendant, but it is exceedingly rare.
1114 2018-07-24 21:38:20 the 13 banking families that run the world control the central banks of the world that print money, give loans on interest and explains how national debt never decreases. Economic crises, oil crisis (simply to increase prices), Arab Springs are all manufactured as are wars.
1115 2018-07-24 21:38:11 DUDE I'M AT WALMART GETTING MY OIL CHANGED AND ONE OF THE GUYS OUTSIDE LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE @ShamierAnderson I KEEP DOING DOUBLE TAKES and maybe staring a lil bit and I keep telling myself I'm being creepy but he's handsome and I'm gay so now I'm slightly excited and confused

1117 2018-07-24 21:37:53 #DeepThoughtsFromTheDeepSouth

I need more oil to fry stuff in...
1118 2018-07-24 21:37:47 Also the fact that the oil supply can be limited on purpose to drive the prices up.
1119 2018-07-24 21:37:46 Coconut oil will clog my pores
1120 2018-07-24 21:37:40 I just read a road sign that said “fresh oil and chips” as “fish and chips” and got excited... disappointed but not surprised...
1121 2018-07-24 21:37:30 No single drop of oil any where in northern Nigeria but Buhari has already signed am mou to start building a refinary in a border town with Niger republic to pump oil from the Niger delta to feed the needs of Niger republic .
1122 2018-07-24 21:37:28 I've got a great kale chips recipe with sesame oil!
1123 2018-07-24 21:37:15 Why is this allowed to happen  I am sick of the squeaky wheel gets the oil.  Conservatives need to get tough or something  Trump better be holding an Ace card.  Criminals can't keep getting their time in the spot light
1124 2018-07-24 21:36:50 You should ask if they unplug everything each time they close to conserve energy. You should ask if there’s any palm oil in any product they make/serve. You should ask how they are funding research to protect the coffee bean from extinction since the yield has dropped
1125 2018-07-24 21:36:45 True! Things that make me feel like a good artist
1- the pencil wiggle before you actually start drawing
2- dapper gloves that keep fingerprint oil off my ink wash
3- running out of my favorite ink and having a new bottle on hand
1126 2018-07-24 21:36:42 Copy paste
1127 2018-07-24 21:36:28 Oil consumption worldwide is set to break 100 mbd shortly. Do you think the tiny squirt we use in NJ is worth taxing the people to death? Is your stupid progressive agenda so important you're willing to sacrifice 9 million people's financial stability on a pipe dream?
1128 2018-07-24 21:36:22 We spend 700B$a yr on military, China an Russia barely spend 150B$between them.This idiot is bound and determined to start a war somewhere,IRAN.dumb idea,those people aren't afraid of us,they have 700,000 soldiers that'll jump in a car of c4 and ram it up TRUMPS ass,no oil,no gas
1129 2018-07-24 21:36:19 Oh okay ! I thought you were going to talk about a hair fixative or an oil hair routine, but that's okay !
1130 2018-07-24 21:36:15 I’m a democratic socialist, bc robots are taking our jobs by record numbers, coal/oil will be a thing of the past sooner then not, and the idea that we can be super rich, and super poor obviously doesn’t work, look at us, we fight amongst ourselves for no reason. #Ridiculous
1131 2018-07-24 21:36:11 @lisamurkowski the heartbreak over your choice to pollute with oil, siding with the most corrupt, greedy, money-laundering, traitorous President is evil. Do you not understand we have a GLUT of oil and Alaskans oil people are moving south because of this! Thief!
1132 2018-07-24 21:36:05 what is the US's win-loss record with the WTO? I prefer free trade too, but raising tariffs PRIOR to negotiating is not the way to do it, especially if it means we resort to more corporate welfare
1133 2018-07-24 21:35:47 So your point is that as long as you pretend we don't use oil your case is right.....good to know
1134 2018-07-24 21:35:30 Previously owned by Arsenal. Better than oil fc tbh!  
1135 2018-07-24 21:35:16 Great choice, Stephanie! The perfect oil for the seasons ahead of us!
1136 2018-07-24 21:35:16 But it comes from a state investment arm that got its wealth through oil, rather than from confiscation of previously private property.
1137 2018-07-24 21:35:02 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
1138 2018-07-24 21:34:52 MS1 was an experienced lawyer who researches companies for a living but you write off his opinion on Tesla because he invests in oil (unconfirmed). You have a blog exclusively supported by Tesla's continued existence. Not sure how you wrote that article with a straight face.
1139 2018-07-24 21:34:27 Yes. Drastically more than just “oil wealth”.
1140 2018-07-24 21:34:25 We can't wait to hear all about your experience with this oil!
1141 2018-07-24 21:34:14 That's me. But Lo i specifically gotta use water, a detangler then a leave in then oil.
1142 2018-07-24 21:34:09 Why deny the fact that we increasingly require more #oil in the #UK each year. Why import it when it is on our doorsetp #UKOG. We will inevitably develop new energy yes. But in the near future it is just ridiculous to import it and pretend it can just disappear.
1143 2018-07-24 21:34:09 no, you don't attack first then negotiate. EU and Japan just signed a trade agreement to lower tariffs and neither side raised them first
1144 2018-07-24 21:34:05 We hope you enjoy this oil so much! It is fantastic!
1145 2018-07-24 21:33:59 How much money are you receiving from the gas & oil lobbyist’s ? You would destroy the last remaining wild beautiful place on earth for riches.? Can’t think of you as a true people’s representative when you turn your back on them. Listen to your people not the wealthy scum.
1146 2018-07-24 21:33:47 A figa say doctors say red oil good give the eyes, or changes come inside now?

1158 2018-07-24 21:32:55 I don't think this calculation accounts for the emissions from the USE of oil products, just the direct emissions from the oil companies' operations.
1159 2018-07-24 21:32:55 He’s called so many people evil the word means nothing coming out of his mouth. He needs to lose his seat
1160 2018-07-24 21:32:49 Hey, without those people who will you rely on? The consensus of congress is pretty tough on Russia. BTW again, oil matters.
1161 2018-07-24 21:32:47 Trump bowed to the Saudi King, did a floppy sword dance, held his ball. He played the fool for Saudi Oil for his friends.

1169 2018-07-24 21:31:33 ~ Massage your hair and scalp with warm olive oil and leave it on for 30-45 minutes. 
~ eating healthy can a huge effect on your hair.
~ Brushing your hair while it's still wet is yet another way to break it, causing it to thin out.

1174 2018-07-24 21:30:56 Don’t American companies take all the profit from oil?
1175 2018-07-24 21:30:48 I’ve told you many times before, I’m not going to entertain your discussion of breaking oil spills and oil shipping related incidents into odds or rolling the dice. 

There is zero risk to Metro Vancouver and our coast if we simply don’t take this risk, beating all your odds!
1176 2018-07-24 21:30:46 I've wondered about this recently. Could an environmentally friendly oil be used to help bind the shale? Used fat? Vegetable oil?

1182 2018-07-24 21:30:01 Norway owns *far* more than oil wealth @MattBruenig has written at length about this. The government publishes the documents in great detail. They own the largest companies in most sectors among other things. Finland is mostly similar
1183 2018-07-24 21:29:57 So @Sondos_q thinks Filipino workers shouldn't get a day off per week and have the right to keep their passports?! Why don't you take care of your kids yourself? You don't do anything all day anyway.. God I can't wait until your oil runs out; back to pearl diving & camel herding
1184 2018-07-24 21:29:43 Sure. Oil dropped like a stone after Indy. Would have been the quickest loan application ever
1185 2018-07-24 21:29:34 If we modernize our grid to a micro grid solar panels microturbines Tesla walls for the house for the neighborhood this would cut down on our need for any Gulf oil no money going into the Gulf all setting their priorities shift two more important things then having a size contest

1187 2018-07-24 21:29:02 These ppl lack perspective.  My family farms, I dont. Borrowing a half million and hoping the rains come at the right time, hail doesnt, hoards of pests or drought dont wipe you out. 
Life year in, year out for many. 
They wouldn't have the stomach for it.
1188 2018-07-24 21:28:51 They're so disconnected from reality that it's juvenile. We can ALWAYS expect them to do the wrong thing, politicize every common-sense reform, and ,rob us blind while they wage war all over the world for oil and other booty. And I don't mean the nice kind of booty I like...

1194 2018-07-24 21:27:50 @Tomscience1 The US's dependence on foreign  oil, especially OPEC's, has required us to trade with those Saudi absolutists. You will never hear me praise patriarchy, despotism, heterosexism, racism, or our own economic system.

1205 2018-07-24 21:26:33 The manufacture will recommend synthetic oil, which plays to them (very expensive) so they will pretend it's the only thing they can put in.

1218 2018-07-24 21:24:45 it’s not on me if you connect w my hair dysphoria posts lmao wash ur shit buy some argan oil you don’t have curls
1219 2018-07-24 21:24:35 Make Mexico Great... Again? Then they wouldn't have to flee and be separated- unless they piss off the cartels of course
1220 2018-07-24 21:24:32 Now they want to pump oil from Niger Delta to refine in far away Katsina! Same way they want to link Nigeria to Niger Republic by rail. Misplaced priority of the highest order.
1221 2018-07-24 21:24:29 Just another perspective. Farms are businesses. It takes a lot of money to run farms. For example, we spend over $100,000 just on seed and we are small farmers. It's all about perspectives.
1222 2018-07-24 21:24:10 Essential oils are Fragrant Oils extracted from plants chiefly through steam distillation (eucalyptus oil) or expression (grapefruit oil)
1223 2018-07-24 21:24:09 ~ try to avoid to overuse tools like fat irons.
~ add oil drops to your conditioner.
~ don’t towel-dry your hair.
~ don’t dye your hair.
~ buy thickening styling products instead of regular.
1224 2018-07-24 21:24:08 Question of the day is Popeye's Chicken Fried in olive oil?
1225 2018-07-24 21:24:00 Brown paper towels are sooo good for getting all the oil off your face.
1226 2018-07-24 21:23:59 Ahh noooo! B careful those pesky bastard are an oil trap 
1227 2018-07-24 21:23:35 fucking oil kept popping on my ass today I swear that shit be following you
1228 2018-07-24 21:23:34 He may say some dumb stuff sometimes, but moments like this are priceless.
1229 2018-07-24 21:23:31 When you have to get an oil change but have no money for an oil change 
1230 2018-07-24 21:23:22 not dancing on their grave, no one wept when the oil and gas industry had lay offs and restructuring.  Nostalgia is no substitute for deep pockets.  As long as a Charles Foster Kane or Jeff Bezos loves the newspaper industry there will be newspapers.
1231 2018-07-24 21:23:06 Perfume bottles come in all shapes and sizes. It may not have been a perfume bottle at all.  It would have had to be very very thick glass to hold that oil and not leak on the poisoners. These are facts we do know and it was the Russians who did it......
1232 2018-07-24 21:23:02 I just told a friend today that I’m not eating things anymore which include palm oil. She asked me why and I told her the reasons. I convinced her and now he’s not doing it either. Thank you for everything, @natboltt ! Xx
1233 2018-07-24 21:23:01 ‘store cupboard staples like virgin olive oil and slutty olive oil’ - Eleri 2018
1234 2018-07-24 21:22:59 Not true. FACT:
@exxonmobil CEO Tillerson signed a $500 BILLION to to drill oil/gas in Arctic sea w/ Putin sole recipient @HillaryClinton  Magnitsky Act blocked the deal, Putin destroyed HRC, appointed Rex Tillerson Sec of State; whom #TraitorTrump  had NEVER met! 

1235 2018-07-24 21:22:48 While I was waiting to get my oil changed I quickly remembered I went shopping for a bachelorette party & didn’t bring my bags in with me. There is a candy bikini top/thong chillin in the backseat as they’re vacuuming my car out...I’m so embarrassed.
1236 2018-07-24 21:22:01 Pro tip:

@Neutrogena makeup wipes work better at removing automotive grease and oil than GOJO hand wipes... they’re also cheaper, smell better, and nowhere near as harsh on skin (and a LOT better for your skin too)
1237 2018-07-24 21:22:00 Socialism is normality zed.  Libraries.  The post office. Freeways.  The electrical grid.  The military.  Public schools.  Medicare.  Meducaid.  Social (dead giveaway) security.  Farm subsidies.  Oil subsidies. NASA.
1238 2018-07-24 21:21:55 I am so disgusted that you would allow oil exploration in the most pristine wilderness we have left on the planet. Shame on you and the Republican cronies who only see $$$$. #ProtectAlaska #Impeach45 @Wherearethechildren

1241 2018-07-24 21:21:24 It depends on how quickly @Tesla ramps production and achieves Level 5 FSD, but I do not expect much impact on global oil demand growth in the near-term. I expect global oil demand to peak around 2025.

1243 2018-07-24 21:21:03  If olive oil comes from olives then where does baby oil come from? 
1244 2018-07-24 21:20:47 funny they are the ones with d oil
1245 2018-07-24 21:20:38 2016 was my best performing year in the money market. First oil prices doubled from 27 to $55, Trump won the Presidential elections then Brexit; I shorted £ and $ for ¥. I made almost 150% profit because I understood humans are trash.
1246 2018-07-24 21:20:30 Is popeyes chicken fried in olive oil?
1247 2018-07-24 21:20:09 Drizzling chorizo oil on eggs can fck reyt off   
1248 2018-07-24 21:20:08 I hope when I come home someone put gas in my car & took her for an oil change. Because I spent way too much money this week.
1249 2018-07-24 21:20:08 I take cbd oil religiously and it really does ease a lot of my anxiety and physical pain. I use a cbd enriched lotion for the physical pain and the pan seems almost non existent for a good amount of time. The cbd oil I take about 30-50 mgs a day and there a tremendous difference.
1250 2018-07-24 21:20:00 In case anyone is wondering how my day is going, I left a literal oil stain on my LSAT prep book after I rested my head on it for a hot minute
1251 2018-07-24 21:19:51 I called BMW directly.  Guess what they did? absolutely nothing.  I just got a letter that said i can get 1k for a trade as part of a class action lawsuit.   Ive spend over 4k just on oil alone.  NEVER AGAIN.   750i is 1 expensive paper weight

1255 2018-07-24 21:19:19 No tiene mucho sentido. Hasta ahora el mercado no la entendía y estaba más correlacionado con el gas que con el oil 
1256 2018-07-24 21:19:15 Leave for work this morning and the pops is headed out to take his truck for a quick oil change... come home to find out he bought a new one instead
1257 2018-07-24 21:19:13 @Walmart  Does your Walmart app have a feature to let me know if I can get an oil change , if there is availability for an oil change?
1258 2018-07-24 21:19:02 I haven’t seen my dad in a few weeks & I called him so he could “check my oil” (I know how to check my oil) I wanted to surprise him bc he’s so excited about me having a baby. I showed up, got out of the car and he was smiling ear to ear “is that a baby belly”

1262 2018-07-24 21:18:30 Our opponents seem to be unaware of this. 
Kinda like me playing chess by the rules, and my opponent thinks every piece is a Queen.
1263 2018-07-24 21:18:26 thats why they attacked MY country iraq JUST for the oil, we had no weapons of mass destruction, this was used as an excuse smh
1264 2018-07-24 21:18:20 Not another war for oil
I don't want my kid going to war for oil.

1269 2018-07-24 21:17:52 Got cbd oil. Will I be ok lmao
1270 2018-07-24 21:17:46 exercise and CBD oil have been miracle workers for my anxiety and i know everyone is different but if you haven't found your thing, i highly recommend CBD oil (you can buy it at health hut for like $20 and it lasts like two months of continuous use)
1271 2018-07-24 21:17:43 Water is the new oil. Why does Russia want to buy the water rights of so many countries?
1272 2018-07-24 21:17:34 In the culinary world there is only one wrong thing, it isnt pineapple on pizza. 
Its truffle oil. It has no truffles in it. Truffles do not dissolve in oil..... like at all. You could soak them in oil for years and never get the flavour out. 
Save for the real thing,its worth it

1274 2018-07-24 21:17:29 Lol I'm sorry what is the lie I told please, just tell me the lie.

As far as I am concerned this Buhari govt is exactly the same as GEJ's government the only difference is the price of a barrel of crude oil was at its highest point under GEJ. Even GEJ knows it now.
1275 2018-07-24 21:17:18 Ever since the late 1980s until today the vast majority of European countries have enjoyed robust trade and economic ties with Iran under the ayatollah’s rule. Europe has also benefited from buying cheaper Iranian oil than from the Arab countries.
STOP!!! STOP!!!

1277 2018-07-24 21:17:06 Here we go again. Govt selling the crown jewels. Thatcher was biggest culprit selling North Sea Oil. This (&NHS) is yet another bargain basement sale. Bl**day politicians. They don't live in the real world.
1278 2018-07-24 21:17:01 Just picking your brain here: what is your projection for US oil demand in the next year, three years, five years, 10 years, etc.? At some point, the rise of electric vehicles will have to start having an impact on oil demand, correct?
1279 2018-07-24 21:16:52 The Knights Templar own all the gold. National Treasure was a documentary! Punk rock was invented by an ad agency to sell spikey pins! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!

1282 2018-07-24 21:16:26 This is the most ridiculous talking point ever. Venezuela was a petro state that attempted to keep political power by buying citizens off with oil money without creating the basis for a well rounded economy. We can talk Germany if you'd like.
1283 2018-07-24 21:16:09 Underestimated this oil pen crazy

1286 2018-07-24 21:15:39 Years ago that may have been true. Not any more.
1287 2018-07-24 21:15:32 Surely the Baron Zinker, is or soon to be.sued. His stealth to diminish one of our most beautiful and historical sites is stealing from our government and its citizens. For more money from oil and gas that is going to kill us all.  Global warming is not fake

1289 2018-07-24 21:15:18 You argue of OUR reliance on fossil fuels and yet the #TMX is about selling oil to Asia. 

You break oil incidents down into Russian Roulette.

You argue safety against rail...we aren’t talking about that here.

The US appetite for oil does not require oil tankers

PS. Pls tell Virginia that mice spiders etc hate peppermint as it plays havoc with their smell so get some peppermint based essential oil and spray around the home and you wont see the little rodents anymore. We use it successfully here in country WA!
1293 2018-07-24 21:14:51 Simon Bolivar had it right. A good system of governance doesn’t allow for fake elections to let dictators stay in power. Maduro controls the oil, food and guns, and has robbed the country till there is nothing left but he, his cohorts and their guns.

1295 2018-07-24 21:14:37 Are some brands of coconut oil better than others??
1296 2018-07-24 21:14:35 Thing is there are more people fleeing war (call them what u like but that bit is fact) than at any time in history. Largely a by-product of exporting big-power rivalries (+ loadsa arms sales + oil fights) to these countries. But I’m all right Jack.
1297 2018-07-24 21:14:27 I know, with the glut of podcasts, Jeff is trying to zig where others zag, but what's next? Mary Kay on repainting the TV room? Pete Smith on changing your car's oil? Dane Brugler on extreme couponing?
1298 2018-07-24 21:14:11 I once ( quite some time ago) watched a university professor ( think it was Glasgow) admit on the BBC that the entire revenue gained from fracking Scotland equated to one year of North sea oil.

1304 2018-07-24 21:13:02 Oil drilling should be allowed in order to lower the fuel prices that will play a significant role in the economic growth of the UK Its that simple #weald basin.
1305 2018-07-24 21:12:59 @realDonaldTrump Why are the fuel companies allowed to make suck a huge profit on gas and oil. For people who try to set a budget can't because they don't know what the price of gas is going to be from week to week.
1306 2018-07-24 21:12:50 Oil Slick? 
1307 2018-07-24 21:12:42 Wait, I got it, let's sell the strategic oil reserve to the Iranians. We won't even miss it!
1308 2018-07-24 21:12:40 for some reason there is an inverse relationship between comp advantage and political clout. Actually US world beating clusters are not all concentrated in blue states: ag, oil & oil svcs, medical & fin'l svcs often overshadowed by flashier tech

1338 2018-07-24 21:07:57 You need to get out more and do a little reading about Iran’s relentless pursuit of power in the Middle East. All of this is funded by unfrozen assets and oil revenues while 35% of Iranians live below the poverty line. This is regime change in the making.
1339 2018-07-24 21:07:48 Ask American  .especially if you have oil.
1340 2018-07-24 21:07:38 So someone heavily invested in oil, creates a fake account to spread lies and misinformation for YEARS. Honestly, I hope Tesla sues Larry Fossi and RahrEnterprise

1343 2018-07-24 21:07:15 Our Secretary of Interior wants to start logging and drilling for oil in our national parks. The GOP has gone over the edge nuts sir. Kinda starting to feel like a Banana Republic out here in the Old North State.

1351 2018-07-24 21:06:29 Mr Friedman, how much do you think this is related to the US soon to become largest oil exporter in the world and a possible motive to create a market for it by restricting Iran’s oil exports?

1354 2018-07-24 21:06:11 @RobinSealark Hey, some random who loves you and your channel here. I was wondering if you'd try Wal-Mart's Daler Rowney oil paints? They're only like 5 dollars especially since they're on sale, and I've got nothing to lose, but I don't know how to judge oils.
1355 2018-07-24 21:05:57 ooogh neem oil does NOT smell good

1367 2018-07-24 21:03:53 Seeing what Qatar is doing with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling Groundnut Oil.
1368 2018-07-24 21:03:49 TAX BREAKS for corporations, SUBSIDIES for oil companies and huge farming operations!  How about something for the lower middle class and the poor - how about SUBSIDIZING MINIMUM WAGE AND SOCIAL SECURITY? Both should be 150% HIGHER - YA'KNOW, LIVING WAGES.....

1371 2018-07-24 21:03:40 Every time I bring my car for an oil change I think about how I lost my first car molly I had my oil light on for a month maybe smh blew my engine on 93 south under the tunnel smhhhh

1374 2018-07-24 21:03:19 That tough Wright engine kept turning until the Nazis left, when it finally lost oil pressure due to the imbalance tearing up the bearings and seals.

1376 2018-07-24 21:02:49 Took my car in to get an oil change and my tires rotated and they just told me it’s time for some new tires and when they told me the price I almost pasted out. Adulting is fantastic.

1380 2018-07-24 21:02:22 Think what it will do to oil prices and then think who benefits from that? Russia mostly with be able to recover economically. Sanctions are a nuisance, low oil prices are a disaster.
1381 2018-07-24 21:02:11 Try the cannibus oil and see if it helps
1382 2018-07-24 21:02:06 I really wonder why trump is trying to destroy Alaskan wilderness. There is a glut on oil so what is the reason? Must be a reason.# why
1383 2018-07-24 21:01:27 Getting an oil change for Taz then balancing & rotating his tires. Maintenance is the key to success folks cuz we’ve been rolling 11 years together no problem like Harlem.

1385 2018-07-24 21:01:11 Disagree somewhat. GP’s media stunts have had some policy impact regarding endangered marine species and oil drilling. The big problem is that GP’s science stances are shit regarding GMOs, nuclear power, certain pesticides.

1395 2018-07-24 21:00:30 I thaw the fillet, cut it in portions, sprinkle it with pepper & salt or herbs & lemon salt , fry it for 10 min on a side in olive oil. or you can bake the whole fillet on parchment on tray for 15 min on a side. Depends on your heat source. Mine is a glass top electric range.

1418 2018-07-24 20:58:33 If Nalcor is wholly owned by the NL government (and it is) than the distinction between Nalcor/Gov't is largely a distraction. If Nalcor doesn't "receive" a subsidy, but uses oil royalties to mitigate rates, that's still money that'd otherwise go into the treasury, so...
1419 2018-07-24 20:58:22 I always feel sooo bad for forgetting to clean my car before bringing to get an oil change because these guys vacuum it as well and I leave a huge mess...

1445 2018-07-24 20:54:38 They drive to the protest with a giant sign that reads keep the oil in the ground. LMAO you cannot make up irony and or ignorance like this. The libs are a free walking comedy show. Zombies on Broadway it's great.#fools

1454 2018-07-24 20:53:49 Be careful with the brand of oils you buy! Just because the bottle says it’s pure, doesn’t mean it is. Companies only have to have 5% pure oil in the bottle in order for it to say “100% pure” on the label! The synthetics added can be very harmful!

1477 2018-07-24 20:50:48 That's very interesting. However, it's time for Russia to stop living on oil and gas alone! Get a modern developped economy. Otherwise you will remain dependent on US-Saudies tandem gambling on oil prices.
1478 2018-07-24 20:50:40 Can you ask your colleagues in Congress who benefit in the millions from farm subsidies to donate their corporate welfare to pay down the deficit? Also ask Paul Ryan to forfeit his oil & gas subsidies too? Thank you.
1479 2018-07-24 20:50:39 WD40 or other penetrating oil.  Worst case you may need to drill it or use a screw extractor (like a screw with threads in opposite normal orientation. As you screw it into the hole drilled into the screw, it allows you to back it out).
1480 2018-07-24 20:50:03 i was worried the water would get rid of the oil like that as opposed to just rinsing and wiping

1482 2018-07-24 20:49:58 I got it, just saying that industry has been cross-pollination regulatory agencies that affect them as long as I can remember. Big oil even subverted our intelligence agencies to a great degree. These assholes all attend the same frats together.

Ashwagandha (as a supplement)

Valerian Root (for sleeping)
Lemon Balm (as a tea)

Buying a diffuser with a eucalyptus & lavender oil combo works before I fall asleep too.

 thanks sandra but i’m just here for an oil change
1489 2018-07-24 20:48:54 What’s missing on your title is that the war is originated at the same Venezuelan government. They are the ones who steal public funds, print inorganic money, cause inflation, increase debt, destroy the oil company therefore income and prevent the economy to come back to life.
1490 2018-07-24 20:48:43 The wind and solar farms are killing raptors by the 10s of 1000s every day... a lifetime of oil production will never come up to 1 day of killing that the wind and solar farms do... I see this first hand and know it to be true....
1491 2018-07-24 20:48:42 What about petrol oil and water.

1494 2018-07-24 20:48:22 My favorite snack; cut the ends off a big bell pepper, cut one side and roll it flat. Trim the waste, cut in half and sautéed in olive oil. Serve the stacked halves on muti-grain bread, or in a roll-up.  

Yummy :)

1510 2018-07-24 20:46:35 Inspiration from Kathleen Woods,

Was at my bffs for 3 days and didnt have my cbd oil. I woke up in a panic today, shaking so hard i could barely hold my coffee cup! Soooo anxious. I took my cbd and 20 minutes later i was fine. NEVER AGAIN!
1511 2018-07-24 20:46:19 Begun the degreasing process from using an oil based pomade for the first time. Apparently Aussie 3-Minute Miracle is supposed to work wonders for this.

1515 2018-07-24 20:46:10 Inflation, starvation, an economy that was based on crude oil, corruption within the regime, outside powers trying to oust maduro as well. Lana had the best thread on it. Capitalists work to crush socialism and always have, the US has killed democratically elected leaders.

1528 2018-07-24 20:44:50 A) Enron Kinder Morgan oil is going to China, I don't care where China buy their oil.

B) It would have been smarter to build a refinery cause our oil is literally so dirty we have to sell it at discount instead of full price.

1540 2018-07-24 20:42:52 Alaska pays a state oil dividend to each resident - last year it was $1100 (should have been $2300) Their brand of "socialism" is very popular with Dem or Republican voters alike. Check out #Geoism #Georgism

1569 2018-07-24 20:39:58 Why would vapable oils be available? My fear is MHRA will take same approach that they have to CBD oil, which would not let anything out of schedule 1.

1574 2018-07-24 20:39:18 You can do the military diet for 3 weeks and lose possibly more than 10 pounds. For hair, you can use the inversion method with coconut oil and grow 5 inches in 3 weeks. Pimp yourself out for $1,000 and as for the last one, we’ll, good luck Kylie

1576 2018-07-24 20:39:16 Yes a MoU has to be signed since its criss border trade, a Refinery will be located in kastina since the oil is coming from Niger, my guess Nigeria will foot the some part of the infrastructure.

If there are any probs it's usu those corps astroturfing a wish list for progressive liberals to fund raise and newscorps to leverage for ad revenue by suggesting it's a political issue for TeamB folks
1609 2018-07-24 20:34:35 We seem to have been upgraded from 'oil cunts' to 'state aid cunts' on Talkshite.
1610 2018-07-24 20:34:33 This is good. BOVAS Oil & Gas from Ibadan has always been consistent and never inflated prices, even when prices are hiked nationwide.

1615 2018-07-24 20:33:11 Make no mistake; the ham-handed attempt to threaten Iran via Twitter by Lord Donny has one purpose; to boost oil prices, which makes his handler Vladimir a lot more money and keeps him in power.
1616 2018-07-24 20:33:08 and another $65, ya boy needs an oil change

Essential oils including cinnamon oil, lemongrass oil, clove oil, peppermint oil, lavender oil, thyme oil, tea tree oil, and, finally, eucalyptus oil. These oils have been proved to kill as well as repel bed bugs.

1636 2018-07-24 20:30:51 Accidentally ran into the USA drilling for oil underneath Longbenton. Blinded with rage. Dropped the bastards there and then. This is Britain you don’t like it you know where the door is. Fuck armericar

1638 2018-07-24 20:30:34 Most of the inflation is being observed in industries that are USD dependent, like oil. Ex transport, CPI is already too low.

1. Mix equal parts of white vinegar and water.
2. Pour the solution into a spray bottle.
3. Add a few drops of any essential oil and shake the bottle thoroughly.
4. Spray this solution around entry points.
5. After an hour, wipe up and discard the ants.

1644 2018-07-24 20:29:57 They might only stock one oil that meets those specs but there are others out there.

It’s though they claim that’s the only supply, so they demand higher prices.

This is like what GM did when they introduced Dexos oil specs...
1645 2018-07-24 20:29:47 this is vegetable oil when vegetables
1646 2018-07-24 20:29:16 About 33k. They were the stock tires. The tread was barely not-illegal when I got an oil change a couple months ago
1647 2018-07-24 20:29:08 Saudi’s 38 years of complete control of the largest oil producer in the world.
1648 2018-07-24 20:29:04 #Walmart. For some reason I don’t think 2 hrs 45 min is reasonable for an oil change.  2 cars in front of me.  Your employees having a good time though.  In and out of office, a lot of hugging and fist bumps, chatting.  Fla City Walmart a mess.  Now 3 hrs.  When will they start?
1649 2018-07-24 20:28:50 Drenched in coconut oil
1650 2018-07-24 20:28:46 The oil has to conform to MS-6395 certification.

They may say only Chrysler oil meets those specs but if you look at a label of many reputable oils that are synthetic it will meet those specs.This is for warranty purposes to meet that oil spec.
1651 2018-07-24 20:28:37 I think it's time America apologize to various countries in the middle east where our lust for oil disguised as the war on terror has lead to the loss of thousands of innocent lives and effectively destabilized the region for decades to come.

1663 2018-07-24 20:27:17 Fascinating watching all these Natwest customers threatening to take their business elsewhere over sponsorship of Nigel Farage, having been seemingly untroubled by the bank's investments in the arms trade, palm oil, environmentally shady business, and other dodgy stuff.

And none of these stories show Rahrs investment in big oil? That seems a pretty big omission.
1672 2018-07-24 20:26:17 We pay for it either way over the years. Via use of oil royalties, taxes, cost increase on power, selling of power. We pay. Don't know which will have least impact on population. I know I can't afford to eat a large increase.

1674 2018-07-24 20:25:58 The government is picking winners & losers. Bailouts for coal & agriculture. Tariffs on steel & aluminum. Foreign carmakers = bad. Oil & gas workers = good.

1678 2018-07-24 20:25:45 Yup. Or like Saddam Hussein requiring Euros as payment for Iraqi oil in 2003, or Qaddafi planning to require the Gold-Backed Pan-African Dinar as payment for Libyan oil in 2009.

1686 2018-07-24 20:24:34 The alignment to Iraq was indeed the Reagan Admin (thru the cia) but even that was orchestrated so as to enflame the region. It disrupted the gulf & all commerce (read: flow of imported oil). It continued the turmoil in the region after the Afghans/CIA ran off the Russians

1702 2018-07-24 20:21:54 It's oil. It'll sell. The point is to drop the bottom out of the market so Iran gets as little as possible with their sanctioned oil.  It's a gamble because China gets super cheap oil, but we'll see.
1703 2018-07-24 20:21:46 Cooking oil Huwa warm n smooth
1704 2018-07-24 20:21:41 Or a potus who unlocks ANWR, increases military spending and deregulates the gas/oil industry!!
Your tweet FAILED
1705 2018-07-24 20:21:31 So they want a president that wants NATO to spend more on defense, a stronger US military, US energy independence, booming economy, and wants Germany to cut ties with Russia and buy oil from the US.

Maybe we would be safer if we just sell them uranium
1706 2018-07-24 20:21:15 So foreign companies really sponsored poaching of mountain gorillas in Virunga so the park could be opened up for oil exploration...wow wild!
1707 2018-07-24 20:21:15 Hard to comply with the sanctions right away when 55% of Turkish oil import is from Iran. US has every right to sanction Iran but it shouldn't be at the expense of its allies.

1710 2018-07-24 20:21:02 Exactly. I broke my back 2 years ago and I refused the pharma drugs they put me on. I smoked and used oil. My Dr had a fit that I wasn't taking morphine, oxycodone and 3 other pills. Said I'm being childish I said FU I'm not becoming your addict. I saw what pills did to my mom.

1712 2018-07-24 20:20:37 GTFO of Venezuela. Venezuela's problems started when they replied too heavily on oil exports to keep their economy up. When the economy crashed with the price of oil dropping civil unrest was inevitable, but it was the rich that started to get squeezed by the government to help
1713 2018-07-24 20:20:01 To be fair, I think that's a pretty common sentiment. That's why this is basically a list of the highest upside names in Canadian oil and gas. :p
1714 2018-07-24 20:20:00 During the 70s most auto mechanics knew a more efficient carbonator or another devise should be able to get near 100 miles per gallon..The "Carboration"  had oil companies had a push not to hep MPG we are doing better but light medal cars had a safety disadvantage .

1715 2018-07-24 20:19:57 We assume with saving and wise to buy cheap oil cheap chicken cheap produce but we pay for it through prescription medicines and with our health

1717 2018-07-24 20:19:43 Tire fixed, new tags put on, applied for a couple new jobs, now getting my oil changed and I’d say I’ve accomplished what I can today, feels good. Let’s drink about it tonight though
1718 2018-07-24 20:19:40 Ha! Good times! Are you spreading a little olive oil on Felicity’s skin when you change her diaper? That’ll keep that wonderful meconium from sticking. Keep it up, Jeremy. Diaper duty is no joke. Your changing diapers, though, will be a huge blessing to Jinger as you know. 
1719 2018-07-24 20:19:39 i cook with oil while my shirt off
that’s real street shit
1720 2018-07-24 20:19:39 I highly recommend CBD oil if you’ve felt like you’ve been having a heart attack for a week straight
1721 2018-07-24 20:19:34 So you know someone who knows a farmer. 
1722 2018-07-24 20:19:08 Ah, you're saying maybe they're doing it with oil profits?

1725 2018-07-24 20:18:51 Not sure that is going on here, though it is noteworthy that some of the largest sponsors of the SMC are pharmaceutical, (GM-) food and oil companies, and big publishers of course.
1726 2018-07-24 20:18:44 Everyone thought Jnr was corrupt... this just proves it. There is still a lot more to come out here. What connection did he have to the Nigerian oil company? What other little deals was he involved in around Africa. It'll all come out at some point.
1727 2018-07-24 20:18:36 Yep. Drove up the price of oil and boosted Russian economy.
1728 2018-07-24 20:18:36 Lol 

Try this next time.

Coco oil in a frying pan.
Stove on medium
Sprinkle cayenne pepper, a lil bit of salt
Slap them up there until DARK golden brown
Flip them bad boys until they are near the the same and see what they be like
1729 2018-07-24 20:18:33 It worked for Democrats up to this point right?
Increased NATO funds, arming Ukraine, calling out Germany sending RU billions, RU sanctions, US now biggest oil exporter, building up our military, 4%+ GDP+, blew up 200 RU+ more. None of this is good for RU & all because of @POTUS
1730 2018-07-24 20:18:30 In a country accepting of cannabis, I wonder why they don’t try cannabis oil for the mothers. Very little risk there, and maybe it could help.
1731 2018-07-24 20:18:08 How did ‘murica get to be number 1? By making oil dollar deniminated and lending ever country dollars to pay back loans used to buy their commodities.... sound familiar? I mean give the chinese credit for (unlike us) taking a good strategy and making it theirs!
1732 2018-07-24 20:18:06 Makes sense, no reason to drag others into it.

I do love the cry "he works for big oil"!!!

And Ross, has some oil in his fund...but that is fine.
1733 2018-07-24 20:17:45 Hate working with my dad, got oil paint all over me !
1734 2018-07-24 20:17:41 Yep let's just wait until all there oil runs out n they go back to being barefooted nomads.
1735 2018-07-24 20:17:32 Unfortunately nothing will change. The Jewish lobby in the U.K. Is too powerful. Palestine was needed by the Rothschilds for their oil pipelines, which drove Englands industrial revolution.
1736 2018-07-24 20:17:28 I really love my oil diffuser

1740 2018-07-24 20:16:53 Better check the oil!.   It must be using it
1741 2018-07-24 20:16:47 It's a good thing I brew my coffee very strong.  I accidentally dropped a fish oil capsule in it this morning.

1743 2018-07-24 20:16:44 I am sure oil platform workers firemen -high wire electric engineers -highway construction workers-coal miners would all disagree with you.
1744 2018-07-24 20:16:43 I don't disagree but a few short years are nothing in geological terms..I remember scientists in the 70's and their predicted millennial mini ice age.. never happened.. same with the end of oil..this may/may not be the same.
1745 2018-07-24 20:16:40 Breaking: Fraud Montana Skeptic was exposed as a massive oil shill, and was forced to shut down his Twitter account because of his fraudulent and illegal activity. LOL.
1746 2018-07-24 20:16:38 Ah, there’s chilli oil on it now, you won’t want it
1747 2018-07-24 20:15:52 WD40, machine oil, almost any lubricant.
1748 2018-07-24 20:15:41 I'll also occasionally use maracuja oil when I'm extra dry. In the winter I use first aid beauty hydrating serum twice a day, with a heavier moisturizer I get from red Antler (I forget the name...day and night??)
1749 2018-07-24 20:15:39 Have you tried 3-in-1 oil?
1750 2018-07-24 20:15:26 Gas prices should be down with the price of oil. As usual Canadians are being abused like with book prices.
1751 2018-07-24 20:15:19 Tedious Levels?
The only level I ever had problems with was Oil Ocean, but that's because you can barely see anything during act 2 and the boss in both stages suck.
I think the level design in Mania is the Best of all Sonic Games!
1752 2018-07-24 20:15:13 The War For Oil lobby has been advocating a war against Iran for at least a dozen years...

1754 2018-07-24 20:14:57 I use the Airwick plug in oil scents in my classroom! Life saver!
1755 2018-07-24 20:14:53 How can the Iranians INSIDE Iran decide their fate? By asking the mullahs in a very nice and sweet tone: "Mullahs, will u + the IRGC pls stop raping, jailing + stealing from us? Will u please give up power? Will u + ur children stop stealing billion$$ in oil money? Pretty pleez?"

1759 2018-07-24 20:14:02 Shut the f**k up. You belong in jail in The Hague where Putin just might end up. Russia just might start WW3 the second the price of petrol plummets. Their economy is oil and weapons. In 1983, they shot down an UNARMED @KoreanAir plane. Never forget those poor victims. #Russia

1761 2018-07-24 20:13:33 It doesn't sound all that much different from our current system, tbh.
We still end up shipping soldiers to far-off places to secure oil derricks, and at least the Helldivers don't have to attend rallies.
1762 2018-07-24 20:13:33 Nutrition is important, healthy diet is important. A lot of illnesses wouldn't happen with a good diet.
Immunity is improved by a good diet.
All agreed and scientifically proven.

But not a replacement for vaccines, to say it is is just snake oil nonsense.

1772 2018-07-24 20:11:53 They are in way over their head. The HFT War on commodities destroys producers investors while helping Fed/Treasury/Banks.  Farmers, miners, investors, oil industry are big losers. Was hoping @realDonaldTrump would stop it but he is embracing the power at the expense of his base.

1781 2018-07-24 20:10:57 Finally got my oil changed. 
1782 2018-07-24 20:10:41 most of this development isn't market ready yet, but by 2020 DWR will be few and far between. Leather still has a way to go, but I assume we'll start seeing leathers and suedes with high oil content or laminated with the same tricot backers we see in textile.
1783 2018-07-24 20:10:32 So you can start planning the sale to big oil, mining interests or big timber?

1789 2018-07-24 20:10:00 The less you shampoo, the less oil your hair will produce. So eventually you won’t need to wash as much. Try to stretch for 2 to 3 days.

1806 2018-07-24 20:08:08 Give it a year. In which such time of course all teams will be owned by oil exporters and sponsored by international airlines.
1807 2018-07-24 20:08:05 It's a fact lol.. daily scalp massages stimulate the blood flow and allow more nutrients to reach the root. Add some oil to your fingertips and go to town on your scalp for about 5 mins each day

1813 2018-07-24 20:07:36 Penetrating oil, or just any oil depending on time. If there plastic, wont work. Plastic twist till give or break. Whichever happens first.
1814 2018-07-24 20:07:36 It's true, the amount of money that Matt saves in costly  oil changes and picture hanging hardware alone allows him to reinvest without a financial burden.

1816 2018-07-24 20:07:04 You're right, picking winners and losers is how we have lost small family farms.
Cut the cord, and big farms can't weather a bad year.
If the investment in 100,000 acres is too much, fewer will get that big.
1817 2018-07-24 20:07:03 @ShepNewsTeam Total yearly oil production. 100 million barrels a day X 42 gallons in a barrel X 365 days = 1.5 trillion gallons. A cubic mile is 1.1 trillion gallons. Compared to forest fires and volcanoes, oil us a minor pollutant. No sea level rise. No temperature rise....
1818 2018-07-24 20:06:58 You could be a sales rep. They get their gas paid for. Some even get car expenses paid for like oil changes and any maintenance on the car. Or if the company is really big they get a company car.
1819 2018-07-24 20:06:54 Never trust car dealerships for free oil changes. 1st time the mechanic ran into something. Last Friday go in and found out one of the tires had a nail in it and for some stupid reason he pulled the nail out so had to leave the truck and then they delivered the wrong size smh
1820 2018-07-24 20:06:51 That's too fast; maybe slowly lower towards boiling oil but keep doing so for hours before the final splash

U said gas is $10 a gallon up there! Only the Eco-Left (tautology) could believe that higher oil prices would benefit the poor (somehow)?

1834 2018-07-24 20:05:15 Yet cleaning up n oil spill on land so it won't touch the water table became the discussion on Black Ink in Chicago and yet reality television shows weren't popular too much in the 80's nothing wrong with oil crossing and marking its leadership with the average guy's thinking
1835 2018-07-24 20:05:13 War in Syria is being prolonged by Russia.   And Yes Russia has been aggressive towards neighboring countries.   Russia benefits from Syria war, this is all about control of oil pipelines
1836 2018-07-24 20:05:08 In the @QTRResearch debate with @Gfilche he literally says "but in my opinion – and this is just an opinion, there's no proving it one way or the other...".

The opinions of someone representing oil interests – such a joke it took this long for his identity to be questioned.
1837 2018-07-24 20:04:57 Still didn't answer what socialist programs Democrats are pushing. Corporations get more welfare than poor people do. Why are oil companies getting millions of dollars in tax breaks when they make billions each quarter.
1838 2018-07-24 20:04:28 Trump unleashed American energy & made the U.S. the largest oil producer in the world. The Russian economy is entirely dependent on oil exports. 

Hillary vowed to block oil production.

1853 2018-07-24 20:02:20 First off I believe burning oil is a bad thing but I’m tired of these people talking about renewable energy and not even understanding that oil is abiotic and is constantly being reproduced by the natural cycle of the earth so therefore it’s a renewable energy.

1906 2018-07-24 19:57:08 Rep. Carnelo wants to eliminate the gas tax and have a carbon tax.  I guess he doesn’t know how the gas tax came about.  Oil sales gas to the fed., and the fed taxes the fuel then, then the State and then city taxes.  This why we have high gas prices.
1907 2018-07-24 19:56:49 Why am I not surprised! Typical. What was that saying? Never let a good tragedy go to waste? I guess they feel this isnt big enough! They are all jumping on the hemp oil and rehab center money!!

1934 2018-07-24 19:54:08 I think they re-negotiate and the cash call gets re-visited to place the know how as collateral vs cash. Lots of people/business have cash, not everyone can lift heavy oil profitably. We'll see I'm guessing and musing. Be nice to see a happy oil story for once.

1987 2018-07-24 19:48:23 My sister cursing me out  but what else are sisters for if not to borrow all your stuff ... “lemme hold your bumpers.............. and blow dryer, and hair oil..... oh and send me a scarf too” 
1988 2018-07-24 19:48:21 Either I need oil, or autocorrect was being extra helpful.
1989 2018-07-24 19:48:20 I need to start putting more oil in my beard
1990 2018-07-24 19:48:14 Palm oil stew with rice.
1991 2018-07-24 19:47:48 Looks like we failed the 50 day test again
1992 2018-07-24 19:47:44 You forgot “central pillar to Colorado’s grade F air quality, government subsidies, 16 explosions since Firestone, & payouts for elected officials”. I wouldn’t have joined oil and gas even 20 years ago, much less today. O&G is a perceived addiction. #oilandgasisnotcolorado
1993 2018-07-24 19:47:44 Buhari to import crude oil from Niger Republic. Carrying coal to Newcastle!
1994 2018-07-24 19:47:37 Got his oil checked
1995 2018-07-24 19:47:35 @HalfordsGarages I am disgusted with the return of my car without the mobile oil or in fact any oil. Sure you'll argue that too.
1996 2018-07-24 19:47:24 The Trump administration announced Thursday a draft proposal to offer offshore blocks to oil and gas drillers in almost all of the U.S. outer continental shelf.
The plan opens the door to drilling in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, marking a break with previous administrations.
1997 2018-07-24 19:47:21 Take SFA out of the equation. How about MUFA? Olive oil? Nuts? Avocados? This said low fat- period
1998 2018-07-24 19:46:44 can't beat a good oil refinery 
1999 2018-07-24 19:46:38 Well uhhhhhh...

What the heck am I supposed to do with all of my ANOINTING OIL then, huh!?

2000 2018-07-24 19:46:27 Nigeria's gas reserves are about three times the value of her crude oil reserves. The largest natural gas initiative in Nigeria is the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas project which is operated by several foreign oil companies and the (NNPC) #natgas
2001 2018-07-24 19:46:26 Gee, it's just a TV show! I mean how was Jeb Clampett able to strike oil with a Kentucky long rifle?
2002 2018-07-24 19:46:24 So Europe imposing quotas and tariffs on steel and aluminum to prevent dumping they anticipate will happen from drop in imports to U.S is wrong? At the same time they condemn U.S tariffs.  It's not black and white
2003 2018-07-24 19:46:18 Thanks for telling me what I care about.

There’s a huge difference, as you know, between the open waters of the Anacortes and the difficult passage through the Southern Gulf Islands, the Lion’s Gate, Burrard Inlet, the 2nd Narrows.

Highly flammable oil through Metro Vancouver!
2004 2018-07-24 19:46:12 is it bad i only eat salad with oil, vinegar, and LOTS of salt............
2005 2018-07-24 19:46:11 Why am I evil? I mean I know I am, but what specifically caught your eye? Was it the comment about DJT and hot, boiling oil?
2006 2018-07-24 19:46:10 i’m living for coconut oil 
in my coffee, on my body, night face “cream”.. give it a try for a week and let me know how it goes! #magic
2007 2018-07-24 19:45:58 The Niger that the mumu president said, the killers are arm by them, and he still want to buy crude oil from them by build a fail refinery in Nigeria hence sign mou seven months to election time. Who is a fool here?
2008 2018-07-24 19:45:57 Because they want to drill for oil & mine for coal push fossil fuels because climate change doesn’t exist - it’s all about the $$$
2009 2018-07-24 19:45:52 (The closest I've gotten is that I got basically proficient with the cast aluminum woks that were standard in the Philippines. The trick was preheating the pan with a lot of oil. But I feel like those were more forgiving than stainless steel.)
2010 2018-07-24 19:45:48 THIS CAR STINKS LIKE OIL. BETTER TRY TO FIX IT WITH MY FARTS AND ASS STANK. *moans involentarily*

2012 2018-07-24 19:45:40 I can't wait until I have a self-driving car, so it can go to state inspections and oil changes, on its own.
2013 2018-07-24 19:45:34 the smell of "oil lobby" presses for self drive, 

however     

USA wants affordable battery powered auto.
2014 2018-07-24 19:45:34 I resigned from my oil and gas job two years ago, started a small business and now I work twice as much.  I also have never been happier, healthier or more proud of myself.  This message of self care and self love is so important, we only get one life.
2015 2018-07-24 19:45:23 If they could make a sunscreen where it doesn’t feel like there was just an oil spill on your face, that would be great.
2016 2018-07-24 19:45:16 Donald Trump

Could allow the oil companies to drill on every square foot of the U.S. and they would still find an excuse to charge $3 a gallon.
2017 2018-07-24 19:45:13 The existing pipeline is all that will carry oil. The Expansion will never happen.
2018 2018-07-24 19:45:12 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!

2024 2018-07-24 19:44:25 The US stole millions of galons of oil from Mexico, the us has treated everyone around the world in the worst way always, and now, you se the victims.....you think everyone believes in your lies, you are so wrong
2025 2018-07-24 19:44:10 Attacking Iran sound familiar? How 'bout those WMD's? In the latter case we wanted their oil. So fun when other countries prevented it. I think the "true"  fighting to fight Iran will surface. To please Israel? Why do we sacrifice our youth like this?
2026 2018-07-24 19:44:09 Puppies need their oil changed? Learn something new everyday.

2030 2018-07-24 19:43:50 Jennifer Rubin is a fire breathing conservative who spent 8 years loudly berating Obama and liberals. Just because she isn’t buying Trump’s snake oil that doesn’t make her a Democrat.
2031 2018-07-24 19:43:42 Enlighten me, does gold etf have copper, silver, platinum, oil...etc?
2032 2018-07-24 19:43:36 As much as we welcome the likes of Billiat and Castro,@KaizerChiefs need to understand that we need to oil the machines not oiled machines...please we need our own Shabbas(unknown to be know) not rejects as a big brand ra kopa
2033 2018-07-24 19:43:28 EVERY MF TIME I get an oil change, they try to get over on me!  I know it’s only because I’m a female
2034 2018-07-24 19:43:23 The whole "They own Oil stocks" so they are attacking $tsla is bogus. Nissan Leaf or the Kona are much better EV's and actually have very good large well capitalized companies standing behind them, not wild men tweeting at heroes etc.
2035 2018-07-24 19:43:20 it took ibuprofen, rubbing on mahanarayan oil, and wrapping my knees in blanket after blanket for them to feel better phew
2036 2018-07-24 19:43:02 It's mucv easier than they make it out to be! I just cook things in oil and wipe out the excess mess and oil when I'm done. Enough remains to season it. (That said, the last thing I cooked in it was a little on the messy side and I need to clean it properly...)
2037 2018-07-24 19:42:49 @elonmusk @tesla @Teslarati @wsj one week in Manila's airspace where oxygen feels less prevalent than ICE exhaust fumes, makes clear Big Oil, Big Autos, Big Media and Big Insurance are ignoring the inevitability of clean digital EV's and making the same mistake that Kodak did.

2045 2018-07-24 19:42:33 Russia wants high oil prices. We want low oil prices. To entertain any notion that we have common interests with Russia in the Middle East is just plain stupid. But they do funnel rubles to Republicans through the NRA, so I can understand your position. $1.05 Marco Ruble-O.

2058 2018-07-24 19:41:04 For me, this map signifies that Ottawa has basically folded up its tent when it comes to having a visible marine oil spill response presence on the west coast. @CoastGuardCAN has basically farmed out its response capability to the private sector in the form of @MarineResponse.

2063 2018-07-24 19:40:51 Do not use hair styling gels. Stay away from products with parabens. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. I really have to solve a problem. Is it NISIM or NHB? Some sort of hair loss shampoo. or something? How do I come across the authoritative web address.
2064 2018-07-24 19:40:50 Globalist tell America what  it can and can't do, AGAIN.

I remember back when oil was around $150 a barrel. Fracking rigs opened all over the place. Suddenly the price started to go down.

It was all the Fracking and oil being pulled out helped Obama's GDP from being worse.
2065 2018-07-24 19:40:36 EU countries have to have a ` Strategic Petroleum Reserve` which is 90 days worth of stored oil in case of emergency,

2113 2018-07-24 19:35:29 This is massively oversimplified, of course. Venezuela's economy doesn't have much international value because oil prices were cut in half, which is part of why they turned to the international market and private ownership in the first place
2114 2018-07-24 19:35:17 Lastly, Elon is a human CEO. It's why people like him. Until recently he was all jokes.

2118 2018-07-24 19:34:42 .@SoccerCitySD - environmental review NOT ALLOWED by initiative. Not shocking from a group of billionaires who partner with the Koch Brothers on steel mills and own a domestic oil drilling company

@SDSUWest - FULL environmental review & endorsed by @SierraClub

This matters 
2119 2018-07-24 19:34:42 think they can use before it expires, or just how much they want if it's preserved or non-perishable (oil is unlikely to go rancid if stored appropriately, same with nut butters which are effectively preserved nuts).

2122 2018-07-24 19:34:34 So basically they want a subsidy for a pipeline.

Oil pipeline socialism.

2124 2018-07-24 19:34:19 He's basically the Snake Oil salesman character from Red Dead Redemption but on a larger scale, it's depressing how many people are willing to defend such an ignorant person.

2126 2018-07-24 19:34:18 @Richzeoli it seems to be unfashionable to say now, but we are still in energy-based economy. When oil prices go up the economy slows. The worst "tariff"of all is the crack down on Iranian oil.

2128 2018-07-24 19:34:12 We would recommend that you add one drop of an essential oil or baby oil to the dried Dipbrow and that you always twist the cap tightly when you put it back on and store the Pomade with the cap-side down (so that gravity with pull the product's moisture back up to the top.)
2129 2018-07-24 19:34:08 Occidental Petroleum Corp $OXY is the latest oil company to consider jettisoning its pipelines. OXY is exploring a sale of its pipeline assets & hoping to fetch upwards of $5 billion. More via @Reuters with @davidj_french and @ErnestScheyder
2130 2018-07-24 19:34:06 Both sides lied and both sides still are.  I'll never be yes until I see an actual viable economic plan as the last one was a joke valuing oil at 10 times its actual value.  But then again nothing is ever @theSNP  fault, it's everyone else's.
2131 2018-07-24 19:33:47 Yes see this is my ponderings! Otoh olive oil was/is a staple in Mediterranean cuisine so I can kinda see it being a staple in Gondorian...? Idkkk.

2174 2018-07-24 19:29:19 McMaster is the key to no offshore drilling.  If he loses reelection, the SC coast will have a horizon full of oil rigs.  You’re freshman congressperson won’t be able to do anything about it.  Vote smart.

2194 2018-07-24 19:27:00 Thankful for the huge amount of advice in the media regarding the heat.

2199 2018-07-24 19:26:39 It is an actual fact that WW2 rationing produced a very healthy stratum. Calcium and iron added to the grey 'national loaf'; condensed orange juice [which did rot your teeth, and how!] malt extract...
...and terrible cod-liver oil. 
But virtually no sweeties & not much fat.
2200 2018-07-24 19:26:38 Hope this oil change don’t take all day I’m starving 
2201 2018-07-24 19:26:35 made from chickpeas, as long as they are cooked in a plant bases oil, then yes
2202 2018-07-24 19:26:29 Pretty sure that's not the case and they're referring to how some places like the fancier Brookshires in Tyler let you initially buy a container or bring your own if it's up to par, fill it with the oil or nut butter, weigh it and type in the PLU#, then put on the printed label
2203 2018-07-24 19:26:25 I’ve had so much hit me at once this sucks. Oil change, AC went out, new tires, and I wrecked my boys front end  it’s killing me

2206 2018-07-24 19:26:06 But our Government has agreed to allow this in the #BarcelonaAgreement . Cheap oil and cash bribes but I don't remember a referendum to ask if we agreed on our replacement, or I haven't had any cash bribes or cheap fuel either!
2207 2018-07-24 19:25:35 I mean... it's Gondor, just after the Victorious Return from the battle at the black gates. More likely to have coconut oil there than most other places Tolkien deigned to name... but I was honestly kinda thinking olive oil? Idk how that ranks as lube tho.
2208 2018-07-24 19:25:33 When I go to heaven, I don't want 72 virgins, I want 72 huge fuckin bottles of extra virgin olive oil
2209 2018-07-24 19:25:30 Paul Ryan very busy stabbing the POTUS in the back per usual. Pouring oil on the waters Pr. Trump stirred up concerning clearances revoked for the bad guys. Says Trump is "trolling" Dems with those words.
2210 2018-07-24 19:25:06 I think one could make a credible case that Amazon may have the cleanest corporate conscience of any company to reach its scale in history? Surely more so than the oil companies, automakers, or industrial concerns. Creates more opportunity for entrepreneurs than Walmart.

2218 2018-07-24 19:24:19 $TSLA bulls and fellow travelers once more show us their delusions of persecution and conspiracy.  Big oil is out to get us.  This is not even a theory.  It’s a dog whistle.  (THREAD)

2223 2018-07-24 19:23:44 Thank you so much for responding and making this offer but we did get the lid off eventually. The wee line of perforations hadn't been punched fully.

2224 2018-07-24 19:23:26 My baby got her care package and this girl said she’s JUBILANT . She’s so happy it makes my heart melt. I put everything in that bitch. Even a oil I personally made. She said it smells like love. 
2225 2018-07-24 19:23:18 As someone who ran a delivery business for many years, I understand your concerns. The price increases for gas hit hard back in 2005 to 2009 with increases much higher than from pollution pricing. I look forward to EVs so big oil doesn’t have so much power over our economy/biz.
2226 2018-07-24 19:23:15 I can recommend coconut oil, but you probably have to have connections for that one...
2227 2018-07-24 19:23:08 Aye this beard oil I bought smells like fuckin cherry blossom roses can stop sniffing myself lmfao

2233 2018-07-24 19:22:47 westminster is still UK parliament. An English Parliament will contain no Scots Wales etc., MP's. If Scotland had said YES they would have all oil and own EU ref. 
2234 2018-07-24 19:22:46 Nope, it was a meta-analysis of climate change studies where that figure was derived. Tell me who has greater incentive to lie - the vast majority of the scientific community getting paltry research grants, or the immensely wealthy fossil fuel industry based in oil?

2236 2018-07-24 19:22:29 you meant to cook or to taste? I cook them in a ceramic frying pan on a v. high heat with a little oil. no problems, very easy! I pop them with a knife when the start to char but just because I like em all flat
2237 2018-07-24 19:22:04 Divide and top of oil and sprinkle over a sheet of the bones; when tossed in batches, so the grill.

2240 2018-07-24 19:21:51 A new piercing is about the same price as an oil change and I really need an oil change so it looks like I’m getting a new piercing
2241 2018-07-24 19:21:44 You do not even understand oil extraction. If you are anti-“fracking”. Then quit using any fossil fuel anything. Fracking, as you call it, refers  to hydraulic fracturing, it is the ONLY way to get oil/natural gas out of the rock it is buried in.
2242 2018-07-24 19:21:44 And pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.  LOL.  He’s just like a snake oil salesman these days.  #CelebrityApprentice

2246 2018-07-24 19:21:28 FYI the leading scientist who studies the polar ice caps is not funded by the oil companies. He was actually funded by the UN until he disagreed with their ideology. Get your news from somewhere else than CNN and you might actually grow a brain cell or 2
2247 2018-07-24 19:21:15 You could REALLY thank them and #HonorOurVets by ending corporate subsidies to Big Oil and fund medical care for our troops. Also, that parade of yours? Feel free to skip it...spend the $$$ on something that matters, like saving lives.  #SuicidePrevention
2248 2018-07-24 19:21:12 Indonesia is being decimated to fuel the demand for Pam Oil, The Orangutan is being burned alive for it. I will stick to my Beef Dripping,

2251 2018-07-24 19:20:11 Just here to report the facts. 
 3.7 million jobs created since the election.
 African American, Asian, and Hispanic unemployment are at record lows.
 Female unemployment is at a 65 year low.
 Record high consumer and business confidence.

2252 2018-07-24 19:19:51 Imagine gutting the Endangered Species Act for oil and logging companies and not thinking you’re a total and complete piece of shit?
2253 2018-07-24 19:19:50 Porque digo "francés" y no "langue d´oil", compañero.
2254 2018-07-24 19:19:40 They accepted help from Big Oil? Back in the cave, bigots!
2255 2018-07-24 19:19:34 Still got me beat. I need an oil change. My radio broke & air. Fml!
2256 2018-07-24 19:19:33 This type of information is dependent on the source... a bit like petrochemicals were paying to have alternative fuels quashed for years. I my opinion why do they need palm oil... there's enough rape grown! (Most allergic reactions to this plant)
2257 2018-07-24 19:19:25 Must. Make. Own. Chilli. Oil. At. Weekend.
2258 2018-07-24 19:19:25 Very, very true in the past. Now it's worse. Now it is pure hatred towards Iran. America is now self-sufficient when it comes to oil. No longer the issue....

2260 2018-07-24 19:19:04 Lately I've been into cooking things with olive oil and Italian seasoning. A cheap way to make things taste Italian haha
2261 2018-07-24 19:19:04 Yes!!! I used to love watching my grandfather put oil on the chain on my bike when i was little!  I would leave it outside. So we could pretend it was my car & fix it again! 
2262 2018-07-24 19:19:03 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
2263 2018-07-24 19:18:59 What @spiderPiglets ? You have stated: "Scotland has independence votes for years" and the oil industry has "still not recovered". Might be best to check your facts before you tweet.
2264 2018-07-24 19:18:49 lmfaoooo fuckkk idk none bout nunnnn i just go when the light come on and say “change oil soon”  you go to the drive thru one on 98?! them bitches put the wrong oil in my shit last time!!!!

2266 2018-07-24 19:18:13 Why is it outrage is only warranted when blacks are considered victims of law enforcement? When criminals are the perpetrators whether black or white no rise of emotion is ever seen. It's just another normal day

2268 2018-07-24 19:18:07 Oh right so you know exactly what's going on and 95% of studies that conclude human activities are causing climate change are full of it? Have you ever wondered by the very few "scientists" that dispute anthropogenic climate change are funded by oil companies?
2269 2018-07-24 19:18:03 Last time vital needs rationed was 1973 oil price rise and miners strike. A Tory disaster that left the economy and country in very bad way. This time may be far worse, yet Tories taking us where we have no need to be. Wake up Britain.

2273 2018-07-24 19:17:08 Your social circle may see you with reliable information, providing you a deeper view - I can't know. However, from what I know of the guy's history, he's doing great things. He's also fighting many bad actors (shorts, oil, auto, media). The pressure must be immense.
2274 2018-07-24 19:17:03 I was going to say, most people recognize my name at least! Hehe, you know... flattery gets you nowhere...!

2276 2018-07-24 19:16:48 It’s good :) and low fodmap if you rinse your chickpeas. I usually use the food processor, but the stick blender works too if you thin it just a little with some more water or oil 
2277 2018-07-24 19:16:44 can tell the heats got less cos me coconut oil is hardening back up

2286 2018-07-24 19:15:07 51k 'like' this . What have you become, America? Falling for a snake oil salesman with the nastiest streak I've seen in any public servant. Good luck!!

2291 2018-07-24 19:14:43 Haha. You dopes that think Norway is still socialist make me laugh. You understand that Norway is sitting on a massive amount of oil, right? That’s why Norway is sitting on a cash surplus; not socialism, dopey. Look up the Nordic Model.
2292 2018-07-24 19:14:38 It’s that hot in this house my coconut oil as melted

2295 2018-07-24 19:14:30 #TyrantBuhari I just pray this Nigeria's crude oil should finish on time, that might wakes us up when the real suffering befall us. Sometimes, best lessons are learnt in a hard way.
2296 2018-07-24 19:14:26 Not to mention that $4.5B is all debt. Plus the costs to complete the project will all incur interest. There is no guarantee that a project of this scale will sell for a profit. Look @ all the M&A in Oil&Gas in SK in 2018 the sale prices are at losses not profits.
2297 2018-07-24 19:13:52 That does not apply to crude oil, as crude oil degrades chemically, has to be sold.

2299 2018-07-24 19:13:13 In an effort to find my holy grail hair product I tried coconut oil. It looks like I haven’t washed my hair or used dry shampoo in a month. If anyone would like some coconut oil come get this mess
2300 2018-07-24 19:13:11 It is in our market! We’ve reacted and used it to our advantage. How about you #IndieHour
2301 2018-07-24 19:12:50 my dad just poured out my two pound jar of coconut oil because he thought it was water 
2302 2018-07-24 19:12:40 Wait, there's an essential oil that's liquid Xanax??
2303 2018-07-24 19:12:39 HOW MUCH DID BIG OIL PAY YOU FOR THIS
2304 2018-07-24 19:12:26 @Oil_Gas_Retweet Don’t waste your time with these people.  We know the truth.  Hillary lost and Trump won. That’s a hard pill for them to swallow.  They  only pill they are able to swallow is their antidepressants.

The only way to do that for sure is to rapidly transition our economy to renewables. Not by building more fossil fuel infrastructure.

2316 2018-07-24 19:11:20 Coconut oil is an amazing natural compound, but it’s too heavy and greasy on its own for many applications.
2317 2018-07-24 19:11:08 Voters hv every right to be fooled repeatedly
Govt's selling shares of 1 PSU to another is a ploy employed to ease cash crunch
BJP-led NDA-I did it in 1999 by goading ONGC, OIL and GAIL to buy each other's shares from Govt 
Cross-holdings were then dubbed as strategic investments

2322 2018-07-24 19:10:32 And the U.S. not an oil monopoly, even though having a big foot in it?
2323 2018-07-24 19:10:32 Well we are switching up our hummus. We got these made in Surrey ones from Habibis that we are excited to try and hope you are too! They are made with Pure Olive oil and natural ingredients!

2355 2018-07-24 19:07:47 Why olive oil? I'm intrigued.

Coconut oil and water all day baby
2357 2018-07-24 19:07:37 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.

2372 2018-07-24 19:06:26 My personal favorite was "We'll give your 2012 NISSAN LEAF a _free_ oil and filter change just for stopping by for a free no-obligation trade-in evaluation!"
Even when they aren't inherently dishonest, form letters can make you look stupid. In this case, really stupid.

2374 2018-07-24 19:06:17 Well it also depends on what kind of car you drive.for instance if you drive a foreign car or a Luxury vehicle then it can cost a lot more.cause they use full synthetic oil.. if you drive say a newer Honda it shouldn’t cost more the $50
2375 2018-07-24 19:06:12 This gate man has disappeared without buying oil in this gen 
2376 2018-07-24 19:06:07 how is my life going you ask? 

i had 4 dollars to my name after getting my tags and inspection and oil change and also have only a quarter tank of gas. 

guess where those 4 dollars went?

to taco bell for some lunch.

He’s only been YOUR PRESIDENT since January 20th 2017.  There is a bright side for y’all.  He’ll be out in 2024.  Maybe y’all will be over Hillary’s loss by then.  #TrumpTrain
2380 2018-07-24 19:05:21 Don't disagree with you Dave though I do not have enough knowledge to argue the point. I will, however, say I have long believed in the nationalisation of natural resources like oil and gas, electric, water. Necessities of life should never be in hands of profit.
2381 2018-07-24 19:05:14 Tell your Representatives: Stand up against oil and gas development in the #ArcticRefuge. http://1/#.W1d4XsDSYnU.twitter
2382 2018-07-24 19:05:13 Worse, “renewables” also includes burning wood and municipal energy solid waste. Those aren’t CO2-free and often are more polluting than oil or gas.
2383 2018-07-24 19:05:12 Lmao  So says the snake oil Con Man!
2384 2018-07-24 19:05:12 I could spoil myself but my car deserves to get spoiled today spark plugs and oil change for my queen 
2385 2018-07-24 19:05:03 Maybe Jared is more of a dollar and cents sort of person. A lower cost but higher octane product like ethanol sure is nice to have. Big Oil would love to charge $4 a gallon for gas but they must be careful or ethanol will eat into their market share.
2386 2018-07-24 19:04:57 These were (are?) made by Bernardaud to serve those delicious "vintage" French sardines in good olive oil. No, I don't have any (this one was borrowed), but I ought to.
2387 2018-07-24 19:04:50 Why do people so often assume that if you are Gluten Free you are also vegan? Do you have any idea how little food would be left to eat if you were both those things? Coconut oil. That's it. That's what's left.
2388 2018-07-24 19:04:49 I hate that I have to do adult things but look like a 12 yo. Had to get an oil change today and p sure they were concerned I wasn’t old enough to drive

2391 2018-07-24 19:03:12 “If your boyfriend doesn’t have rough hands or calluses and can’t change the oil in your truck, you don’t have a boyfriend, you have a girlfriend” 

wise words of my big brother lol
2392 2018-07-24 19:03:05 How were the SNP responsible for the oil price drop?

Also if you were pro indy in 14, and know that in an indy Scotland you can vote for any party whose policies you like, why did you change your mind? The SNP is only a vehicle to self government.

2411 2018-07-24 19:00:48 at least you'll get back to being dry and not-so-oily unlike us impending oil spills in here, that's the upside
2412 2018-07-24 19:00:44 The thing is that fossil fuels will no longer fulfill the needs of civilization as it progresses. Plus we know how to make oil, gasoline from carbon materials. However like gas lamps and buggy whips oil and other fossil fuels will eventually no long propel civilization.

2418 2018-07-24 19:00:17 I totally agree, the problem isn’t Israel. 

It’s sectarianism, and that has been a problem for two thousand years there. We now have world superpowers vying for influence over the region because of its control of the worlds oil and gas reserves.

2444 2018-07-24 18:57:33 The food of the B. monks are predictable: steamed chickpeas (always)+leafy vegetables, no oil no seasoning. I don't recall any rice. Wholesome but plain. They practice the 10 Precepts so after 12 noon, they fast and meditate for the day. And they are always peaceful. Amazing.

2488 2018-07-24 18:52:45 The low£ makes exports “cheaper” but most manufacturing uses imported parts& materials -considerable amount in US$-including oil&gas so costs go up&therefore either prices increase to maintain margins or margins are hit. Lower margins mean reduction in costs(jobs)-so no real help
2489 2018-07-24 18:52:43 Big Oil goes from begging for cash to begging @CNN to stop spewing Fake News and telling lies on the air.

2509 2018-07-24 18:50:05 I’m not so sure about that. I recall growing up in the 70s and 80s and there was a nationwide panic over growing Japanese manufacturing and auto industries. The oil bust of the 80s was also writ large on at least the southern psyche.

2517 2018-07-24 18:49:28 Those saying why can't he buy Usmanov rn, he can't. Dangote is in the process of building his $18 billion oil refinery in Nigera
2518 2018-07-24 18:49:25 And you can’t get both. You can’t get “environmental dictator killing our land” AND get “pro-Russia” because they’re contradictory of one another. The land we restrict that Russia can access, they will(Arctic) and the reduction in oil for us helps Russia- u can have environmental
2519 2018-07-24 18:49:20 Fry the darn thing, in a 5 gallon drum of cheap oil, until the lips fall off!!!
2520 2018-07-24 18:49:13 Putin's Russia has been declining for 4 years now since annexing the Crimea.
Desperate to have sanctions removed, money is tied. Russians are leaving, taking all, not putting money back. Only have oil n gas.
So, corrupting Trump and others was necessary, desperate!
2521 2018-07-24 18:49:10 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
2522 2018-07-24 18:49:08 South west is easy. Just cook palm oil stew to go with what ever you are cooking 
2523 2018-07-24 18:49:08 Is this interview with Elton and David going to be in a paddling pool full of olive oil? #c4news
2524 2018-07-24 18:48:52 I lived in Texas when the oil industry went bust in the 80s and in Charlotte where banks were hit particularly hard when the housing market collapsed (when I was laid off twice in 2 years). It sucks and I sympathize with people losing their jobs, but grow up & deal with it!
2525 2018-07-24 18:48:52 Sitting in this bar and I actually just asked if the oil that the chips were fried in were vegan. Who am I?!?
2526 2018-07-24 18:48:50 No such thing as a Socialist Utopia! Socialism brings no utopia only heartache, famine, disaster, food shortage, drug shortage, oil shortage. Only in Gene’s head was it a utopia. I get what your saying! Look at Venezuela and tell me
Where has Socialism worked??
2527 2018-07-24 18:48:48 He can't right now as he is in the process of building his $18 billion oil refinery
2528 2018-07-24 18:48:21 Italians always being oppressed  all we wanna do is bathe in olive oil but I guess not

2538 2018-07-24 18:46:40 We hadn't seen rain for many weeks, so it was a wonderful blessing yesterday. I hope you all receive rain too! Lavender oil is one of my favorites, along with Patchouli. And thank you, dear Polly 
2539 2018-07-24 18:46:39 Indian cuisine dinner last night, yummy! Typical plant-based menu for me but just some flavor for a change. I deferred on the wheat bread with potato although tempted, just plain type. no spice (for wimps), avoided coconut oil (per AHA), no added sodium. See you soon!
2540 2018-07-24 18:46:33 Depends on your car. My oil changes are $200.
2541 2018-07-24 18:46:24 The Company I work for has a record of using slave labor in Asia, supporting the Death Squad regime in Haiti in the 90's to keep wages down and has a horrible labor record in the US.
Oil companies are destroying the environment AS WELL as recruiting Death Squads across Africa...
2542 2018-07-24 18:46:17 The senior management of Nilepet corp should channel the institution's resources, time and energy in developing the oil sector; leave the roads and agricultural development to the concerned departments. Keep off the pet projects of politicians and lobbyists. Focus on your mandate
2543 2018-07-24 18:45:57 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
2544 2018-07-24 18:45:55 Reminds me of a Snake Oil Salesman. 
2545 2018-07-24 18:45:52 I Remeber I think it was last season or the season before he said he wants to complete his $18 billion oil refinery first then focus on Arsenal
2546 2018-07-24 18:45:27 No what happened was oil was discoveredin scottish waters,when Mcrone report showed amount of it WM kept it secret.Then when it was exposed they lied about it,then voted to take 92% of it leaving scots with 8% and foodbanks<
2547 2018-07-24 18:45:27 That kind of arithmetic unfortunately had tried to attempt to kill her oven near this oil move inside that judge minute's trouble.
2548 2018-07-24 18:45:16 Me- coconut oil is supposed to be really good.

Sof- not as much as you might think.

Me- no, for sex.
2549 2018-07-24 18:45:16 Satire has been used to make a point by exaggeration for some time and quite legitimately.  Her obvious inexperience and lack of knowledge in original interviews is not funny, just pathetic. This highlights this fact, and is funny.
2550 2018-07-24 18:45:16 The oil would be nice in glass  but I think most would prefer plastic.
2551 2018-07-24 18:45:15 Interesting bit of information. Thanks.
I guess the data came to reflect the countries that seriously depend on their oil exports to balance their budget.
India is not in that catagory.
Peace.
2552 2018-07-24 18:44:51 heeeeyy who wants cheap oil paintings made by meeee?

gonna shove a couple on the ebays
2553 2018-07-24 18:44:50 Today’s EPA is run by coal and oil lobbyists. It’s impossible to ask about the institution vs. the current administration.
2554 2018-07-24 18:44:47 He literally just throws words at his supporters, and they eat it up. He rides into town with pomp and sells miracle cures to rubes. Replace AF-1/Marine-1 with a wagon, and that's all you've got: a snake oil salesman.
2555 2018-07-24 18:44:28 Look @SecretaryPerry when I ask, I expect answers. Because when I ask it means it is urgent. Gas  price headache must have been your top priority as soon as I started calling on you to address to the American People it what is going on Publicly with price of oil & gas!

2562 2018-07-24 18:43:11 Actually soap just like regular bar soap is good for your skin because it breaks down dirt more than a face wash would soap is used to break down oil and dirt initially so the ones that might be on your face will be washed away by bar soap
2563 2018-07-24 18:43:07 Coconut oil, raw Shea butter, and honey but I don’t put the honey in daily
2564 2018-07-24 18:43:04 Np. Ofe ora - boil your meat then add dry fish boil, then add pepper boil, then add palm oil boil, add ogili boil, then add cocoyam paste (but really use achi to thicken ora for best results and the flavor is better), add cray fish then add ora leaves. DO NOT CUT ORA WITH KNIFE
2565 2018-07-24 18:42:55 When give the mechanic to do a specific job on the car .. like for example change hand break oil.. but him and his big nose ends up who knows where with  the car and telling you your carburetor is broken ...who send him at the carburetor !??!??!?!

2569 2018-07-24 18:42:29 So you are concerned but while in Helsinki when asked Putin said he wanted Trump to be elected president.. Hmmm now Putin wants Dems to win??? You are a Hack and a Con Man.. what’s this 2 for 1 on the snake oil? Grifter and Chief!
2570 2018-07-24 18:42:22 Why do all F-150s sound like they are completely starved of oil lol
2571 2018-07-24 18:42:21 Anyway someone hit my car n left two dents and a scratch in the paint but did NOT leave a note and I hope they choke on hot oil is that dramatic
2572 2018-07-24 18:42:17 I ask the president to shut down Irans oil distribution line. Hit them where it hurts.
2573 2018-07-24 18:42:04 @AubreyMarcus how fast is Alpha Brain suppose to work? Tried the free trial for 4 days but had trouble really feeling a noticeable cognitive difference. Took it with light meals and light coffee. Btw...Almond Milk Latte MCT Oil is insanely delicious
2574 2018-07-24 18:42:00 Did you use Greyhound to get to your oil sands protests?
2575 2018-07-24 18:41:42 Oil his hair ?!?! 
2576 2018-07-24 18:41:34 When it rains it fucking pours dude. 720 to get my damn start button fixed for my car and including the oil change. So close to a 1,000 
2577 2018-07-24 18:41:27 Thanks bud, but it’s not the years, the mileage.…And I’m long overdue for an oil change
2578 2018-07-24 18:41:19 Jesus Mike you've drag one up here mate. 
Listen 100% not Brad which team is it? Utd or St Louis? You can't be both now. And what's this about dirty oil money you keep rabbitting on about? I think your a bit like your avi - a fooking helmet
2579 2018-07-24 18:41:08 Now what? Perhaps the oll prices rising to the level that can rejuvenate oil sands project.
2580 2018-07-24 18:41:07 If you're paying $100 for an oil change, it better be a 20,000-mile oil change.

2586 2018-07-24 18:40:52 Any baking needs in place of your usual butter or vegetable oil
2587 2018-07-24 18:40:40 Westminster is the English parliament that was supposed to dissolve in 1707 but never did.
Tell me who to blame for scots getting 8% of their own oil revenues..who`s fault is that?
Who is to blame for making EU vote UK wide with no debate?
2588 2018-07-24 18:40:35 I have oil free toner and cleanser since I am oily as hell but I shall look into this I need masks I just don’t know which one lmao I’m fucking lazy
2589 2018-07-24 18:40:32 Sharrows were invented by russian intelligence to give US traffic engineers an excuse to delay the construction of connected networks of protected bikeways.  That oil's not going to burn itself!
2590 2018-07-24 18:40:27 Let me know when you guys have managed to stop oil palm expansion, and then I can stop working to make sure it is deforestation-free. Until then....

2593 2018-07-24 18:40:12 Thinking about that senator in the simpsons approving a grant to drill for oil on mount rushmore

2601 2018-07-24 18:39:24 just waking up off that oil 
2602 2018-07-24 18:39:20 I remember pulling multiple all nighters seemingly every week. I was completely swamped with school and I wasn’t even taking all AP (in my case, reading comprehension and ADD went together like oil and water). Mad props to your daughter she’s a dedicated and hardworking student
2603 2018-07-24 18:39:01 Whoever said baby oil removes tan is an absolute liar
2604 2018-07-24 18:39:01 Scam, totally. If it's just an oil and filter change, definitely. Even if your car uses Synthetic Oil (which most newer cars do) It should be about $45-50 range.
2605 2018-07-24 18:38:54 Apparently that’s what thickens them up, it may not be true, it was an 80’s rumour. The man at Bristol airport who’s in charge of the alcohol samples told us Bailey’s has veg oil in to thicken that up...equally as grim! We bought the Cotswolds make instead, very nice it is too!
2606 2018-07-24 18:38:53 Let’s get it done. Cop the oil filter, I’ll get the oil and we live
2607 2018-07-24 18:38:44 Paying an extra $10-$15 for valvoline instant oil change so you can sit in your car and be in and out is always worth it.
2608 2018-07-24 18:38:44 Train tracks don’t travel over oceans to Asia @BlairKing_ca ! Only oil tankers do. This discussion has never been about a pipeline @BlairKing_ca , but rather what comes next...oil tankers, oil spill and oil fires!

Keep lobbying @BlairKing_ca !
2609 2018-07-24 18:38:42 Ahhh... Chili oil. Lots of chili oil 
2610 2018-07-24 18:38:33 Funny how no oil burning hasn't really hurt mercedes performances eh.
2611 2018-07-24 18:38:26 Even tho, Iraq is the third oil producer in the world, but still there is no enough Electricity, fresh water, high way roads, good education system, good universities, good health system. Been the 3rd oil producer is not enough to be a successful country.
2612 2018-07-24 18:38:22 Coconut oil is such a good eye makeup remover, until later on when you get the blurries because you got coconut oil in your eye. Oh like I'm the only one

2617 2018-07-24 18:37:42 Another drama created by Americans. So  true human beings live only in America?. Because Iran refused to sell crude oil in USD$ , they are threat to the world.

2619 2018-07-24 18:37:40 Im blaming westminster,scotland had its say indeed and it will again whenever it`s people want to have a say.

2625 2018-07-24 18:37:16 CanadianFramer GreenpeaceCA Also we are pushing for a 100% renewable energy transition both within Canada and globally. That means we don't want oil imports and are actively campaigning to make that happen. Glad you support that push. ;) #green #ecofriendly #environment

When you've listened to a minister pounding the pulpit against the 7 deadly sins, for your whole lifetime, suddenly change his mind & embrace a snake oil salesman, experience/logic/common sense should take over.
2637 2018-07-24 18:35:23 I need to get adopted to the family the ones I know own oil shit I sit there trying to learn whatever I can till they stop speaking English

What other modes of transportation move oil over oceans? Only oil tankers!

Keep lobbying @BlairKing_ca !

2649 2018-07-24 18:34:30 Come on oil Cos!! Rs and big oil are destroying mankind for a money grab! Don't these ppl have families?
2650 2018-07-24 18:34:24 Well, I do have massage oil on my back and it's making me all mellow and relaxed so you are not wrong.
2651 2018-07-24 18:34:19 Maybe if all these libs would stop going outside at night and screaming at the sky polluting the atmosphere with all that carbon monoxide,that might helpor all the constant waste of gas and oil traveling the country for protests.or the trees dying to make their posters?
2652 2018-07-24 18:34:13 Dude’s a nasty snake oil salesman, of the Democrat variety.  Why isn’t he resigning (forcefully) yet...?
2653 2018-07-24 18:34:07 That's something I've really been wanting to try. Rose is one of my weaknesses and I need an oil that works with my skin
2654 2018-07-24 18:34:00 Can’t wait to get my oil changed just so i can get the free drinks and snacks while i wait for my car
2655 2018-07-24 18:33:51 So when Al Gore says it= true. When another politician denies it = lie. When a government funded scientist says it = true. When a “big oil funded” scientist denies it = lie. Did I get that right?
2656 2018-07-24 18:33:39 Also, area is seeing loss of $ and people as north sea oil dries up. These homes would not be for permanent residents, but vacation homes. Not a popular proposition there.
2657 2018-07-24 18:33:02 Have you tried tea tree oil?
2658 2018-07-24 18:33:00 Tell your Representatives: Stand up against oil and gas development in the #ArcticRefuge. http://1/#.W1dw1A2HgmQ.twitter
2659 2018-07-24 18:32:59 Also we are pushing for a 100% renewable energy transition both within Canada and globally. That means we don't want oil imports and are actively campaigning to make that happen. Glad you support that push. ;)
2660 2018-07-24 18:32:57 Good one and yes he gets his dose of snake oil as soon as his feet hit the floor in morning.
2661 2018-07-24 18:32:48 Le go jela motepa ka fish oil
2662 2018-07-24 18:32:45 Nache oo see Summy... But I couldn't do nothing
2663 2018-07-24 18:32:43 Of course you do.  You probably don’t have a job and living off the government.  Keep spreading your lies but keep in mind that only liars are listening.  #FakeNews #LiberalsAreLosers
2664 2018-07-24 18:32:39 He wants us to stick with Westminster who have blown an oil fortune and bankrupted the country
2665 2018-07-24 18:32:39 I already did this... I live in Scotland and m Scottish and voted for Indy, just after that the oil crash happened and I realised that the SNP didn’t have a clue.
2666 2018-07-24 18:32:35 I bought the rose hips nourishing oil and I swear it SAVES my skin.
2667 2018-07-24 18:32:35 I think we were all waiting for this switch to flip. Heck, they might want to pretend to help the democrats... to throw more oil on the fire.
2668 2018-07-24 18:32:29 You don't deserve to speak there #CadetBoneSpurs What have U done 2 combat vet homelessness?

2669 2018-07-24 18:32:26 Please seriously think about running in 2020. But first, I’d like to know your stance on coal & oil use vs renewable energy sources, pipelines through native lands and their risk to land & water contamination,  clean drinking water for towns like Flint, gerrymandering, gun sense
2670 2018-07-24 18:32:22 @bennesonj  @MalcolmNance I guess they believed the 2nd coming of PT Barnum. They voted for the snake oil salesman. As one “basket of deplorables” said on TV “He’s one of us.” Yep, uninformed, inarticulate, undereducated and some just Alt-Right racist. I have no  sympathy. #MAGA?
2671 2018-07-24 18:32:21 "hobby homesteader and doTerra oil guide" is a fancy way of saying "rich"
2672 2018-07-24 18:32:13 The USA asked some countries to stop imprting the Iranian oil only because Mr. Trump wants to punish the Iranian government. In fact this punishment will affect the people more than the government. This method of imposing sanctions on others doesn't work anymore.
2673 2018-07-24 18:32:13 If we end up with no deal brexit, how will we get oil? Petrol? Sugar? Ben and Jerry's? Chocolate? What about the coffee, goddammit?? You wouldn't like me without a coffee. I can get very anti brexity without a coffee. And without the other things too.
2674 2018-07-24 18:32:10 One of our best ideas @Hunter_Oil Irondale was to start a group text with our drivers, operations, and GM all together. Our communication and comradery has never been better.
2675 2018-07-24 18:31:44 While Tullow oil rotated around with technology to discover oil, guys in Nakudi just discovered it while digging a grave for a deceased native.

2681 2018-07-24 18:31:20 If you want your engine and transmission to last, don’t ignore early warning signs. For example, if you see drips or puddles in the area where your car has been parked, arrange to have a quick checkup. Your car might be leaking oil, coolant or transmission fluid.
2682 2018-07-24 18:31:10 The farmers don't make me as mad as giving money to oil companies in subsidies companies that are making billions off of us and our security and then they are entitled to welfare

2702 2018-07-24 18:29:24 My father fought in World War II and he would be disgusted if he lived to see you, a total con man that sells snake oil to the ignorant, president of the great United States of America.

2704 2018-07-24 18:29:21 Sold all gold reserves, gave away billions to foreigners, discouraged investments, destroyed oil & gas sector, invited world’s welfare roaches to come here, ruined relations with USA, etc.

2705 2018-07-24 18:29:16 So I just found out today that @summitplacekia set me up to get killed June 14th 2018 and My new car dealership is just as dirty because they never changed my oil or the filter last month like they said they would  and they think it’s funny 
2706 2018-07-24 18:29:11 His base was ready for a bigot in office. He is a con, snake oil salesman, liar and much more. Yet there ignorance won't allow them to see the truth.
2707 2018-07-24 18:28:53 care to name some examples where keeping a giant block of ice full of suicidal maniacs would be "strategic" other than to mine it for oil?

2714 2018-07-24 18:27:53 In other words, low oil prices are bad for Russia, so Republicans want to destabilize the middle east more to increase oil prices, helping Putin.
2715 2018-07-24 18:27:49 @elonmusk Has anyone considered building a pipeline from East to West to transport water?  All the water from rain/floods is being wasted, would be nice to see it being used where it is needed.  Much more valuable commodity than oil.
2716 2018-07-24 18:27:46 Hey #US! What I have been managing to do on my own is to keep gas price stable. If I didn’t do what I do we would have paid 20 to 30 cents more per gallon at the pump. 

Oil companies hate me for doing what I do. Because they share the costs. But to see significant drop
2717 2018-07-24 18:27:44 Good summary of our oil economy. And sadly many in Canada would consider it “fake news”.
2718 2018-07-24 18:27:27 And the reason you believe this is either "because God" or "because oil".

2724 2018-07-24 18:26:59 The oil industry just loves "BULLSHIT"!
2725 2018-07-24 18:26:47 love going for an oil change and hearing afterwards all of the many problems with my car lmao
2726 2018-07-24 18:26:23 Translation: Trump is panicking, he knows Dems are going to win the midterms so is trying a desperation move. Trying to begin a coup by telling his base a Dem win is illegitimate.

Obama crashed oil prices and imposed sanctions crippling Russia's economy, Trump works for Russia
2727 2018-07-24 18:26:19 We make lots of oil here. Including Phoenix Tears and shatter and rosin. The Phoenix Tears are very popular as they cure many diseases

2734 2018-07-24 18:25:43 Not sure the what the criteria is for the London Weighting allowance but I know housing is more expensive there but in areas of North of Scotland, food, furniture, oil, petrol, gas, deliveries, transport etc is very dear so how about a Scotland weighting allowance?
2735 2018-07-24 18:25:40 Sounds like a strawman based on arguments I didn’t make, but whatever you say. It’s pretty obvious that capitalist politicking is the issue, & centering on libraries as the main issue in the same breath as criticizing the oil lobby is shallow, and intellectually dishonest of you.
2736 2018-07-24 18:25:33 Carolyn is right.   Just because a set of minerals is used by oil and gas doesn’t mean their application is even remotely the same. Also, growing organic is much more stringent in its rules and forces growers to become better farmers.
2737 2018-07-24 18:25:12 Being Gemini means it’s hard to be alone.. so when I go get an oil change by myself I swear it’s like the end of the world for me lol.

2750 2018-07-24 18:23:44 Oil is a fungible world resource.  Trump really hasn't got much "control" of it.  And good thing you are not "Ark" and invest only in unicorns.  Keeping an eye on fiduciary responsibilities for your customers - is a good thing.  Make them money incl in good dividend core stocks.
2751 2018-07-24 18:23:36 Look into a good moisturizer first. Oils are meant to seal in moisture, but only work effectively when used in moderation (aka at night). My fave moisturizers are the Tatcha Water Cream and the Ponds moisturizer. I have oily/combo skin. My fave oil is unrefined Vitamin E oil.

2754 2018-07-24 18:23:20 first it was the oil capsules (1:1 which doesn't help anyone out of 5 conditions you "can qualify") and they had to recall them because they were leaking, now it's some bs mix (1:1) and it's being sold in 1 digit numbers.
2755 2018-07-24 18:23:20 Story time. There’s carpet in my kitchen. Today, I spilled olive oil on the floor. And now I’m thinking scary things about my security deposit.
2756 2018-07-24 18:23:01 Spiders hate peppermint oil. Put some in a squirt bottle + water and spray your garage and all door frames.
2757 2018-07-24 18:22:57 They claim they are a "ecosocialist" government. But without the proper plan and law enforcement they have caused terrible damage. The gov is responsible for oil production and at the same time, environmental regulations. There is no proper division, therefore corruption
2758 2018-07-24 18:22:48 after years of getting screwed over by shady mechanics, i finally found a decent place in my neighborhood that never tries to upsell me & have always charged me fairly. today i bring my car in for an oil change and they're watching fox news. this is a deal breaker

2775 2018-07-24 18:20:36 "Opening up" ANWR is mostly symbolic. Oil cos. want the the right to drill here in the future, if need be. We must make sure THERE IS NEVER A NEED. Only way to do that is to keep oil prices so low it's not profitable to drill there. Only way to do THAT is ramp up alternatives.
2776 2018-07-24 18:20:31 Made gazpacho last night. The best "gazpacho" I ever had was a salmorejo at the counter of a wine bar in Beaune of all places. Tomato, garlic, old baguette, & lots of olive oil.
2777 2018-07-24 18:20:12 I'm sure someone said something pretty much identical to this about Standard Oil and look how that turned out.
2778 2018-07-24 18:20:11 Ok thanks for the advice cuz I’m like wth I use oil on his hair damn near everyday.

2784 2018-07-24 18:19:53 Educate myself? What do you mean by that? I go to City Council meetings, I drive by sites every day, I get letters from oil companies. I am pretty well-informed. 
Remember my original point: the single pump on the mug isn't reality at all for a lot of people.
2785 2018-07-24 18:19:26 Completely agree with (b). I cook on stove in a pot with coconut oil and popcorn (!) salt. Then put in a bowl and toss to flash off any moisture that makes it chewy instead of crunchy. Then drizzle/toss with butter with no more water and finish salting to taste.

2810 2018-07-24 18:14:53 Why do u feel that there will be talk of  higher oil prices? Recently there was a plethora of geopolitical alignments that could have moved prices such asThe Venezuela, Libiya  and Iran narrative. Even that perfect storm couldn't move the price of WTI above $74.00

2814 2018-07-24 18:14:30 They certainly don’t want a president who threatens larger conflict with Iran and drives the price of RU’s only exportable commodity to $200+/barrel. A president who cedes Syria and allows RU bases to control all oil shipping to Western consumers. Certainly not.

2913 2018-07-24 18:04:58 Surely that’s the point- city have bought the league! Previous to your oil baron you were knocking about in the 3 division. Liverpools net spend was used by the original poster to explain that lfc don’t.
2914 2018-07-24 18:04:57 Getting the oil changed is so tedious ffs
2915 2018-07-24 18:04:54 Don't like being watched. You white people harrass people of color constantly. I bet you think it's right when the military came to attack the native Americans for their oil right
2916 2018-07-24 18:04:16 @Generac my centurion generator was purchased in 2014 & my mother’s was purchased  in 2013. We both have oil leaks. After doing some research I see that Generac has had a problem with oil leaks since 2008 & you have done nothing to rectify this. Sounds like a #classactionlawsuit
2917 2018-07-24 18:04:11 Saudi Arabia don’t want to be an oil dependent country any more, instead they diversify its economy.
2918 2018-07-24 18:03:57 how dare you speak ill of the Democrats’ 2020 frontrunner
2919 2018-07-24 18:03:55 Proverbs 21:15-17 -  When justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous but terror to evildoers. A man who strays from the path of understanding comes to rest in the company of the dead. He who loves pleasure will become poor; whoever loves wine and oil will never be rich.

2921 2018-07-24 18:03:33 JUST DO WHAT YOU'RE ANOINTED TO DO! YOUR OIL, YOUR ARMOUR IS JUST FOR YOU! YOUR DNA CAN'T BE DUPLICATED!
2922 2018-07-24 18:03:24 The notion that foreign states interfere in Libya because they are interested in its oil, is garbage.

Just my humble opinion.
2923 2018-07-24 18:03:19 I don’t think that was oil...
2924 2018-07-24 18:03:17 Trump dumb ass throwing shots at Iran trying start war , knowing damn well they don’t play bout their oil.
2925 2018-07-24 18:03:15 Suggestions on someone who can change my oil or where to take it too???
2926 2018-07-24 18:02:48 I'm sure he's one of them. Ask him about the blood money he got from Africa (Lundin Oil), etc.
2927 2018-07-24 18:02:46 Someone just got on the train and smells like chip shop oil and curry. It’s not pleasant at all 
2928 2018-07-24 18:02:40 I hate seeing those commercials or videos of the poor lil ducks & stuff that get caught in oil spills with all that toxic shit all over them. now, if the CEOs of these companies were the ones stripped naked and flailing in oil as it flooded their mansions, I'd be ok with that
2929 2018-07-24 18:02:33 Those pesky commas.

2932 2018-07-24 18:02:27 There might be if LIbya did not have oil of interest to foreigners
2933 2018-07-24 18:02:27 [Oh gosh, hes smoother than Makoto, at least!]

Right, right! I’ve come to find we’re all unique in our own ways!
2934 2018-07-24 18:02:11 On one hand, believe whatever you want, but don’t tell me that all chemo and radiation did was kill my spirit and poison me or some shit and that all I needed to do was use CBD oil or something to cure a rare and complicated disease despite decades of scientific evidence
2935 2018-07-24 18:02:10 All we want is for someone to be as excited to see us as Gordon Ramsay is when he sees olive oil.
2936 2018-07-24 18:02:04 Aku pakai itu, tapi yang greentea. Bagus banget buat komedo sama oil control sih. Jadi halus, dan scrubnya lebih kecil dari yang apricot. Kalau kamu jerawatan ya bagus sih pake yang varian ini
2937 2018-07-24 18:02:03 I am awesome and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.
2938 2018-07-24 18:01:57 Besides marching, how are these young people taking on big oil?
2939 2018-07-24 18:01:55 I really love coconut oil  I use this shit for everything
2940 2018-07-24 18:01:46 Everyone knows the maximum calorie density for food is around 9cal/g (achieved by, e.g., oil). What if you put volume in the denominator?
2941 2018-07-24 18:01:38 With the imposition of Canadian sanctions (including a ban on goods for offshore, Arctic and shale oil exploration/production) against Russia in response to it’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, Alberta’s sales of machinery to Russia fell by... #abecon

2943 2018-07-24 18:01:07 We're not near that point yet. Iran would incur the wrath of practically the whole world (which depends on oil) by shutting down the straits. Their economic situation will have to get a lot worse before they risk going there.
2944 2018-07-24 18:01:05 Oil of Ulay. I use it daily.
2945 2018-07-24 18:00:53 "Ivanka Trump"

Yet another Trump failing at business. These people are shams. Phonies. Snake oil salesmen. Everything they touch turns to shit. Anyone who tells you these people are successful business people are morons. 

#GOP #Trump
2946 2018-07-24 18:00:52 +In addition to trade deals, as until the early 70s the oil was 50% owned by American corporations, the Saudi government had been allowed to own the oil as a part of the petrodollar treaty with nixon. Until today Saudi Arabia uses dollars in international trade
2947 2018-07-24 18:00:47 They hv tried blowng up oil pipelines farmers/herdsmen killings, impeachment, poisoning to frustrate PMB bt they failed
2948 2018-07-24 18:00:42 Like I said our children are not our own here. I get protecting kids from child abuse, but it goes too far here. They control just about everything we can try with them. There was a mum who tried cannabis oil with her asd kid, did wonders, he even started talking. 1

2952 2018-07-24 18:00:20 He loves all forms of pollution & toxins in our air, water, & land! Doing away with all those pesty environmental, financial, and safety regulations & protections. To profit oil/gas corps, dirty utility plants, factories, giant factory farms, big banks, 
real estate developers!
2953 2018-07-24 18:00:14 Norway kept the economy going,westminster sat back and left it to rot while they smoked a fat cigar and opened an offshore account!
That's the whole point for me,WM has taken 92% of scots oil for 40+ years and STILL managed to bankrupt the country!
Scots get 8% ffs
2954 2018-07-24 18:00:13 Right about now I would be sippin on a piña colada on the beach or in the beach in Cancun.. But instead I have to go get an oil change 
2955 2018-07-24 18:00:13 When you get to do the oil change for the car and decide to visit your brother at work.
2956 2018-07-24 18:00:13 Seems fair as he inherited a bunch of Russian oil company stock from his father.
2957 2018-07-24 18:00:07 We know that oil producers love the fact that @RepCurbelo supports drilling in the #arcticrefuge and that there is nothing in this carbon tax bill that would stop them. Carbon pricing is irrelevant if it fails to recognize imperative to #protectthearctic and #KeepItInTheGround
2958 2018-07-24 18:00:06 True and I use mainly Spanish and sometimes Greek olive oil :)
2959 2018-07-24 17:59:56 Honestly if he got tinctures or an oil he wouldn’t be so opposed. It could help his hands & his tendinitis
2960 2018-07-24 17:59:47 Evangelical 'christian' ploy against Shia Islam?  
We screwed up Iran once, 1953. They had democratically elected PM,   nationalizing the oil industry.  CIA staged Coup d'etat. We showed them!
The monkey could not dance and blamed it on the floor being crooked.

2962 2018-07-24 17:59:44 The only reason it works is because it dries out your skin, but it strips your skin of all the natural oils in the process. Aloe is better. I sometimes use tea tree oil as a spot treatment, but it can also be very drying, so it’s not good to use all over or a lot of it.
2963 2018-07-24 17:59:39 Hi Gregory.  enviroism goes beyound recycling and banning straws. Tired tactics are not working.  new tactics are opposed by entrenched interests like oil producers. Your PM wants to buy that oil pipline to the sea. So i have little hope. I do what i can. Yours in sorrow. Steve
2964 2018-07-24 17:59:27 Tea  oil helps cure papilloma virus. It also helps when rubbed on the forehead over sinuses when you have sinusitis.
2965 2018-07-24 17:59:20 I'm so proud of sister. When I say weird I say it adoringly that she has a weird knack for blending oils. And she made a blend for hair care product that will be open to everyone. Anyone tried natural oil blends before?
2966 2018-07-24 17:59:14 Recently, a Mt. Gretna School of Art student created an oil painting of our carousel deer and 1926 Wurlitzer band organ. What do you think? — making art

2971 2018-07-24 17:58:59 Indicting 13 Russians, telling Iran to not mess  with the  US, calling out Germany for buying oil from Russia and selling weapons to Ukraine is your idea of helping Russia  ??
2972 2018-07-24 17:58:44 It was Al-Jazeera. He cashed in on all of that sweet Qatari oil money to save the Polar Bears.
2973 2018-07-24 17:58:40 I brought my boss’ truck in to get an oil change and some other work done and they said it’d be an hour to an hour and half, which is fine since I’m getting paid to sit here and play on my phone. BUT.
2974 2018-07-24 17:58:36 FLOP CANOLA OIL

Hehe, is that so? One of a kind, huh?
2977 2018-07-24 17:58:27 @Sumeeeey so you're still at FAAN? I saw u during closing hours,but I was with some expatriates from Spain,we went on inspection.
2978 2018-07-24 17:58:26 My room is clean, new bed sheets, aromatic oil burning. I feel at peace about something for once.
2979 2018-07-24 17:58:09 Asking the same question, but am not surprised PF and debates it’s water and oil

2982 2018-07-24 17:57:58 My mother in law and sister in law swear by a spoonful of caster oil

2984 2018-07-24 17:57:38 I’m sure this refers to college degrees...look at what industry supports bakersfield...agriculture and oil

2986 2018-07-24 17:57:30 To add to it...yes the US would keep “such a dysfunctional” state without the oil for strategic purposes alone.
2987 2018-07-24 17:57:20 I need my oil change Ima be up there in a lil bit
2988 2018-07-24 17:57:11 BP  Well we are playing an oil team next.
2989 2018-07-24 17:56:41 Got some oil going good
2990 2018-07-24 17:56:31 NBC, likes to think it is a news agency. But as we know NBC is only a Snake oil sales force for the Socialist Left. And America isn't buying any more.
2991 2018-07-24 17:55:58 Alaska does have a lot of oil... that doesn’t take away from the fact that your statement claiming it was purchased because of the oil is completely wrong.
2992 2018-07-24 17:55:56 I have a feeling people don’t realise how damaging the 5 dollar down day was to big risk books.The article GS did on equity top level bid ask can be applicable to oil.Big risk mandates and appetite here will be quite low - means that with the snd in question here be careful guys!
2993 2018-07-24 17:55:56 Brazilian production growth so far in 2018 has been lower than expected. At the same time, refiners’ thirst for crude oil will remain high during the summer period before seasonal maintenance kicks in.
2994 2018-07-24 17:55:48 Instead of us finding way to work our refineries to greater working capacities and enlarging our  crude oil sales... We are going to buy from a neighbouring country.. What is so wrong with you people?
2995 2018-07-24 17:55:46 No worse than the EPA making deals with Oil and Lumber Corps., Huh?!
2996 2018-07-24 17:55:43 Hmm. Fires, floods, water shortages, food security, 500M$ annual (unsustainable) cost of fire (BC alone!), chemical poisoning causing cancer/autism/birth defects, unusable farm land. And on and on. Who will pay to clean it up? Oil will just say “we poor, taxpayers clean for us”
2997 2018-07-24 17:55:39 People preaching American exceptionalism, particularly those preaching it through a Christian lens and *especially* those preaching it through a white Christian one, are selling the same snake oil that was once branded "the divine right of kings.

2999 2018-07-24 17:55:37 Also never switch it straight off at the end of a journey, Always let it idle for a minute to cool the oil saves pipes and turbos!! #motoringadvice we should be top gear presenters 
3000 2018-07-24 17:55:35 There is no coexisting with the financial industries that imploded the economy in 2008 whose toxic assets were transferred to the public, the Oil Cartels that are destroying the ecosystem, the Prison Industries, the Military Industrial Complex etc., slave labor tech giants...
3001 2018-07-24 17:55:34 So ummm...I forgot my beard oil and balm in MD & I ONLY f&*k with @unclejimmybrand so I figured, no big deal #Philly is the birthplace of the beard so ANY beauty supply spot will have some but like the late Charlie Murphy said...WRONG!
3002 2018-07-24 17:55:34 What is happening with high gas  prices is that oil companies are lobbying Capitol Hill to keep them. This is my impression @lisamurkowski @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @POTUS . #Tatiana
3003 2018-07-24 17:55:33 Two other supply disruptions are likely to be short-lived. In Alberta, 360 kb/d of output from Syncrude’s heavy crude upgrading facility was shut-in from 20 June and in the North Sea oil production fell sharply in May by nearly 360 kb/d and output likely remained constrained
3004 2018-07-24 17:55:27 In the South Asia section on the third floor while being eyed by erstwhile oil painted Maharajas in full royal regalia. Pukka ambience that.

3006 2018-07-24 17:55:14 Life Hack: 

Sometimes you gotta call your parents on stuff you already know just to make them feel needed. 

I call my mom and dad occasionally to ask about detergent and motor oil like once a month, and they STILL haven’t caught on. 
3007 2018-07-24 17:55:14 re-emergence of Libya as a risk factor in global supply saw production plummet to around 500 kb/d in July from close to the 1 mb/d level China receives nearly 140 kb/d of oil from Libya.
3008 2018-07-24 17:55:13  Yes. When characters start looking like Bob, your disc might be damaged.

Also, he looks like someone tried to create a CAS in 2K18, set the oil, veins, and muscles to 100, did nothing else, and went "Done!
3009 2018-07-24 17:55:08 Shut up!  You are going to try to sale the Russians hacking the election in Dems favor if they roll over the house in the midterm?  You are selling snake oil!
3010 2018-07-24 17:55:07 I've never been a big smoker but it's the only thing that's helped my anxiety in the last year. I hate smoke so I try edibles more. And CBD oil. It doesn't get you high so I don't think you get the anxiety that comes with weed. It helps with insomnia and pain too.
3011 2018-07-24 17:55:05 Actually the problem is nationalized oil which is under government's control.
3012 2018-07-24 17:55:00 Do I need $115 shimmering body oil? Probably
3013 2018-07-24 17:54:59 With the way APC is going down, they will soon discover oil.

Hahaha. The decamping no be here oh!
3014 2018-07-24 17:54:48 They look so beautiful I need some rn but a tip for the chocolate is when you met it with a double boiler, a tiny bit of coconut oil will loosen it and make it coat easier xo
3015 2018-07-24 17:54:46 Actually its fact.The UK & US manipulated Iran & other nations over the past century.
Mega Oil profits do strange things to good people.
The Soviets did similar.Its neo cons/deep state trying 2 push trump. Ya know Libya Syria Yemen Iraq?
Point is Trump might it better.
We hope.
3016 2018-07-24 17:54:42 Scotland's acknowledged oil and gas reserves are currently valued at what? About 1.5 TRILLION dollars I believe......better to start now than not at all.
My point was, look at what Norway has done with the money and then look at WM and Scotland.
What are your POSITIVE arguments?
3017 2018-07-24 17:54:35 Oh man, EVOO or avocado oil tastes better. Or, eat an avocado or a hard boiled egg. Also, the mayo may have been made with sunflower or safflower or canola. It's a process to learn all of it.
3018 2018-07-24 17:54:26 Except all around it are huge mature walnuts all thriving as normal and new trees ditto....may have to fell it because if it's got some awful lurgy I cannot infect a local industry, walnut oil etc.

3028 2018-07-24 17:53:23 Because Republicans keep giving huge tax breaks to rich people.
3029 2018-07-24 17:53:13 I hate these fuckers who treat me like a robot who just needs an oil change 

Fuck off, you can’t just pump me full of magic happy pills to make me work like you want to
3030 2018-07-24 17:53:13 Dulu aku pake EVOO buat ngilangin beruntusan sih, bukan buat cleansing oil. Mereknya Borges kalo nggak salah. Belinya di bagian minyak goreng di Mirota 
3031 2018-07-24 17:53:09 Yeah ironic,same places oil is from!Middle East could produce & store enough energy to export it all around world in proper storage devices!
3032 2018-07-24 17:53:05 Radical idea to rescue the world's economic system : destroy all surpluses - burn all oil reserves stored (if unrefined them dump em). Destroy melt up excess metals in a safe way. Dump excess foodgrain in forests or bury it as fertilizer. Surplus destroyed == growth @zerohedge
3033 2018-07-24 17:53:04 Oh sure :: ivanka shutting down her company. What about the other truer snake oil sellers?
3034 2018-07-24 17:52:57 Best solution for low prices is low prices.  Crude oil didn't need government subsidies to correct just 2 years after crashing.
3035 2018-07-24 17:52:55 Came across this campaign by farmers #STOP
S- stop using white processed sugar (alternates: coconut or palm sugar, jaggery, honey)
T- use 8mg of turmeric everyday in food.
O- Cold pressed oil is safest.
P-use Pulses grown in India(packages should contain information of source)

3038 2018-07-24 17:52:41 Selling snake oil today?

With their departure, things will fall into places. WHITE GARMENTS SD NOT BE SOILED WITH PALM OIL. Good radiance 4 APC & Democracy.
3042 2018-07-24 17:52:24 alaska has a very high natural oil reserve and that is entirely the reason the usa bought it. the problem is all that oil is under ice. alaska also has the highest gun crime in the country, you think the usa would keep such a dysfunctional state if it wasnt beneficial?
3043 2018-07-24 17:52:20 I dislike the way she talks about people. We aren't fools being sold snake oil. How do you suffer through such a shallow personality.
3044 2018-07-24 17:52:19 And this is why you should always schedule a regular oil change 
3045 2018-07-24 17:52:05 Most of Iran’s oil goes to Asia, however, with China and India currently taking over 600 kb/d each.  consider that both China and India are exposed to Venezuela, importing respectively 250 kb/d and 325 kb/d, the world’s second and third biggest oil consumers face major challenges
3046 2018-07-24 17:52:04 The Honda isn’t burning oil because it’s not running
3047 2018-07-24 17:52:01 July 24 1987 – US supertanker SS Bridgeton collides with mines laid by IRGC causing a 43-square-meter dent in the body of the oil tanker
3048 2018-07-24 17:51:59 Snake oil!  Our eyes deceive us.
3049 2018-07-24 17:51:56 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles.
3050 2018-07-24 17:51:46 Britt puts lavender oil in the room and I have no problem falling asleep
3051 2018-07-24 17:51:41 in Newfoundland our vape shops offer cod flavour oil.
3052 2018-07-24 17:51:33 Disagree. Much better than ugly wind farms or fields of solar panels in the countryside. Senseless not to do this and keep paying through the nose to import gas and oil..
3053 2018-07-24 17:51:30 And hey my 300 is currently burning no oil
3054 2018-07-24 17:51:16 Trump's offer is obviously a grab at straws to try to woo his base back since the walls are closing and he knows what's coming. Wonder who's going to pay for this move? Is he helping the coal farmers, the oil farmers, the environmentally destruction farmers? We shall see.
3055 2018-07-24 17:51:00 oil paintings feel so weird tbh ... im so not used to it... still have to practice a lot but its fun
3056 2018-07-24 17:50:57 Every Kazuichi I’ve come across has these /habits/ you know!
3057 2018-07-24 17:50:32 It still will be illegal to sell edibles in this form after legalisation. :) Legal edibles (the way medical patients have been using them for years) is in the form of oil taken with a dosage dropper, just like a cough syrup. Some medical companies make gel capsules now too.
3058 2018-07-24 17:50:28 OPEC oil ministers and ten non-OPEC oil ministers have met and agreed to achieve 100% compliance with the Vienna Agreement (i.e. they will increase production).
3059 2018-07-24 17:50:16 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.

3061 2018-07-24 17:49:41 Not half as demented as the "I sold all the national oil reserves for $28/barrel"

3063 2018-07-24 17:49:18 Middle East Gulf countries and Russia, comes at the expense of the world’s spare capacity cushion, which might be stretched to the limit. 

This vulnerability currently underpins oil prices and seems likely to continue doing so. no sign of higher production from elsewhere

3065 2018-07-24 17:49:17 I do my damnedest to avoid buying anything with plam oil as an ingredient. Sadly, I'm a banana junkie. Are the organic ones anyless likely to come from illegally appropriated land?
3066 2018-07-24 17:49:15 Trump also is challenging putins energy grab of an oil pipeline into europe.Trump also just sold the Ukraine 200 mil arms deal to protect themselves from Russia. Obama gave the Russians Crimea and the Ukrainians blankets.wake up Lenin called those who were fooled useful idiots
3067 2018-07-24 17:49:13 -he uses it. It could also be because he has oily skin but idk )
Oil eliminating toner says it all. It's a spray so maybe they use it on him as a "setting spray" or when his skin gets really oily (it also has a refreshing effect so there's that)-
3068 2018-07-24 17:49:02 Whatever she is giving, I have no business with but I will call out lies when I see it. BamBam also has Bam oil. That girl is booked but makes no noise because she is classy. Go and compete with yourselves but when it comes Bisola, only BamBam comes close. Team no noise #BBNaija
3069 2018-07-24 17:48:53 True,  Tinubu has a very huge portfolio, I would even say he's richer myself. But most of these guys have hidden sources of wealth,  particularly oil money and front companies, so you can't tell how rich they are exactly.

3073 2018-07-24 17:48:34 Lobbying from Evangelicals, in addition to influential Jewish American politicians (Perle, Wolfowitz, Krauthammer, Libby, Kristol) alongside weapons companies and oil companies led to the 2nd Iraq War and the morass in Afghanistan. US foreign policy must NOT be made in Tel Aviv.
3074 2018-07-24 17:48:19 I bet I burn less oil than you bitch
3075 2018-07-24 17:48:12 Stir fry it quickly in avocado oil and add some Tony Chachere's. Mindblowing.
3076 2018-07-24 17:48:01 This dude got me hemmed up in his slp . I cant move @ oil
3077 2018-07-24 17:47:48 Graham i have worked in the oil industry for 25 years and you’re now talking rubbish, Norway have built a fund from the beginning and not the end of the industry.
3078 2018-07-24 17:47:48 yes because if trump attack iran it will be a disaster for the world economy. iran will respond by trageting oil sources. prices will be sky-high
3079 2018-07-24 17:47:39 Trump is buying votes with this bailout, plain and simple. Has he also started gutting our emergency oil reserves to get gas prices down in time for midterm propaganda?? So much for that call to Saudi Arabia to increase oil production!!
3080 2018-07-24 17:47:27 I'm suprised it's taken 2 years to realise that Corbyn is a snake oil salesman.
3081 2018-07-24 17:47:25 Any move on waterways should evoke a response that takes out naval and oil facilities and puts their lights out literally.
3082 2018-07-24 17:47:19 Yeah. I think kroenke knows he can get so much more for us. aliko has this oil refinery idea to sort out and then we might see a different owner. Its either that or stan sells to barron trump in about 10 years. 
3083 2018-07-24 17:47:09 I know you are trying to spin the Dem. Talking points, not going to work here. After Obama's economy, Never Again. You want to talk about wage stagnation, look at the last administration. I want a future for my children, not a Socialist quagmire. Ur selling snake oil.
3084 2018-07-24 17:46:57 Obviously not a fan or Trump, and the Russia meddling seems to be true, but Trump has actually not really been pro-Russia. Sanctions, sending weapons to Ukraine, trying to get the EU to buy US's oil, rather than Russia's gas, if he really has ties to Putin, they're not good.
3085 2018-07-24 17:46:56 Don’t forget jetsetting like an oil drenched sheik in utter, bespoke luxury while your people in Tibet drink curdled Yak milk if they are lucky.
3086 2018-07-24 17:46:55 You & the way far right want to deregulate everything so the big oil & gas companies can drill anywhere they want with the lowest costs possible. Regulations are for the benefit of the people, deregulation is for big corp. I forgot, the right actually believes corp. are people.
3087 2018-07-24 17:46:47 In a little olive oil, sauté some onions and cubanelle peppers. Add well seasoned chicken breasts, and a cup of puréed tomatoes. A little oregano, salt and pepper. You’re welcome!

3091 2018-07-24 17:46:21 Venezuela has heavy oil but they have no production capacity and are in a mess/
Argentina has heavy oil but need much time and capital to get running.
Canada has it too, but needs a sea change of sentiment by world investors.

3096 2018-07-24 17:46:03 He lied about WMDs and started an oil war. That’s the most Republican thing anyone can do ever! If the MAGAs have turned on W. then, I don’t know, man—America has reached an entirely new level of crazy.

3099 2018-07-24 17:45:55 No, that's the PP Action Committee which is separate from the actual clinics. Or do you think that the Kochs are using their oil/gas subsidies to fund the Republican party as well?

Our nation is too large, our economy too large. Our politicians already corrupt. It would be madness.
3104 2018-07-24 17:45:26 Def a snake oil salesman 
3105 2018-07-24 17:45:20 Do you really think that? Long before Chavez there was a huge wealth gap, the benefactor's of the oil industry & the ones left in the dust.  Capitalism was the lead up to the societal divisions. After that the authoritarian (not socialist) gov of Chavez & Maduro didn't help it.

3107 2018-07-24 17:45:12 To me, he did win. He’d put the fear of a lost family into the system and will go so far to get back at legal system who
1. Fucked up the DNA.
2. Showed how bias the legal system is.
3. Two lawyers violated Gerard’s 4th Amendment.
3108 2018-07-24 17:45:06 Government finances are nothing like household finances. With independence we have control over all the relevant economic levers. Why do you assume that we would "spend more than we earn", have you seen Norway's Oil Fund?
3109 2018-07-24 17:45:00 I have a graphic t-shirt with a nice "F@#K PALM OIL" written on the back...
3110 2018-07-24 17:44:59 Huh, I didn’t know you did oil paintings!
3111 2018-07-24 17:44:39 Fact is as long as NAFTA stands US will have guaranteed access to 3/4 of our Oil & 1/2 of our Natural Gas supplies no matter how we get it to Market, It's written in the deal. Why else do you suppose Trump hasn't introduced Oil/Gas tariffs. They already own it.
3112 2018-07-24 17:44:36 kayak kemaren ditanya, temen ke mana. refleks jawab “bentar gue cek wasap dulu. ga inget alasan hari ini apa”

sama gue sampe niat mo beliin period oil sama kotak p3k biar ga sakit sakit lagi
3113 2018-07-24 17:44:15 There are few if any Light Oil jurisdictions not in the control of Tyrants.
Heavy Oil which is in abundant supply may offset and dethrone light tight oil as a feedstock going into the 2022-2028 time frame. Demand will outstrip supply not due to reasons we could understand in 2018
3114 2018-07-24 17:44:14 Yes please let's beat the war drums about Iran.  risk premium -> higher oil prices. NOTHING motivates and angers the bovine American electorate like higher gasoline prices. Hello blue wave! Trump is doing more for Dems than all their whining and circular firing squads could.
3115 2018-07-24 17:43:43 Yes bro oil de my head plenty

3121 2018-07-24 17:43:16 Someone should build a superconducting transmission line that connects power plants across Canada. That would be better than an oil pipeline.
3122 2018-07-24 17:43:04 No ..I’ve no idea about the likely oil price/market backdrop ..all I think I know is that once they are cash generative the GLA asset will begin to move towards a more realistic value

My view is c2B barrels recoverable is worth $3-5 per barrel post EPS & pre full FDP @$70oil

3136 2018-07-24 17:41:54 Nor is it any coincidence that among the VERY FIRST actions taken by Congress after DJT took office was to begin annihilating wildlife and environmental protections, erasing science from discourse & from websites, & pulled out of leadership on Climate Change. It is about the OIL.
3137 2018-07-24 17:41:54 What might happen if Iran makes a deal with, say, the EU and the EU doesn't include the US? Asking because a lot of what Trump thinks might help the US economically revolves around oil production...

Or perhaps this is just a red herring? Snake oil.

3156 2018-07-24 17:40:01 Light oil used to make diesel is going to fetch a premium 2X where it is now in 3-4 years. This will kill alot of refineries who can't buy high to sell low and they will simply fold and close, exasperating the problem as supply craters.

3175 2018-07-24 17:38:09 you have to use, experience, education, and intuition. it's definitely not the oil rag in the back pocket image.
3176 2018-07-24 17:38:08 And used motor oil no just cooling stuff
3177 2018-07-24 17:38:02 You would think there would be a law banning snake oil salesmen from profiting from snake oil sales. We defo need a Written Constitution...
3178 2018-07-24 17:37:35 voting for governor in pa is like deciding what oil company you want in charge of legislation, except one candidate willingly engages with oil companies with the knowledge of climate change and the other is literally trump 2.0

3189 2018-07-24 17:36:31 I never said that it couldn’t help with certain things. I said if it can’t sustain itself without government subsidies then it shouldn’t be around. Besides oil brings in major tax dollars and many other bonuses.

If Iran could hire journalists, shows, "transactional deals"- what kind of internet would they create? They'd change your nation from within.
3199 2018-07-24 17:35:25 We just asked for olive oil with our bread and the waiter said he couldn’t give it to us because of the government. And then he brought it to us and said “here’s some ‘water,’ I didn’t see anything.” ??????

Boil water for pasta of your choice, heavily salt and add a splash of olive oil AFTER it boils.

•Brown sugar sloughs off dead skin while coconut oil packs it with moisture.

3309 2018-07-24 17:23:12 In my experience, the stickers never last because most controllers have hella oil from peoples hands and they don’t wash it off so the stickers slide off, but a new controller will be expensive, so there is pros and cons to both
3310 2018-07-24 17:23:11 Don’t forget the oil you can buy too! 
3311 2018-07-24 17:23:02 @femigbaja when they had the oil money and power they couldn't win, with their extravagant spending, so come 2019 @OfficialPDPNig shall lose
3312 2018-07-24 17:23:01 Luv that oil on you...
3313 2018-07-24 17:23:00 Next they will be wheeling Sir Ian Wood out again to say oil is rapidly running out and nothing to bloster an economy, despite it keeping Brexit Britannia from going under at the moment.
3314 2018-07-24 17:22:42 Which reminds me of the old Soviet joke (in Moscow), "Why do Estonians use oil when watering their gardens?"
3315 2018-07-24 17:22:37 Aj rat apni gaand mein oil laga k sakoon sy so jao kal raat itni jalan ho gi k mirchon ki zaroorat ni ho gi
3316 2018-07-24 17:22:32 Black families don’t waste oil no matter how rich we get. Leave the leftover in the frying pan... Someone’s definitely gonna need that oil to fry something tomorrow.
3317 2018-07-24 17:22:27 Wait until Trump taps the emergency oil reserves to bring down gas prices prior to mid terms.   Trump is the epitome of dirty fighters.
3318 2018-07-24 17:22:23 I've started stockpiling:
bergamots; dashi; mooli; sherry vinegar; whelks; burrata; fennel; truffle oil; puy lentils
Think I'm going to be ok
3319 2018-07-24 17:22:19 You’re absolutely right. “Activist” efforts do more harm than good for the environment because as you say other producers with no standards will make up the difference. Efforts to landlock Cdn oil are strictly a profit play and thanks to you and others Canadians now understand.
3320 2018-07-24 17:22:00 U are the person making a fool out of yourself, U read National Oil Refinery but u want to argue that they mine petrol. Jokes on u!
3321 2018-07-24 17:21:53 I'm not arguing your data or industry conduct. I'm advocating a more nuanced discussion of the data, politics, etc. But I'd note 1980 economy was bad shape reeling from a 1978-79 oil price shock.

3329 2018-07-24 17:21:24 Dumb parroters man. Wake up. Trumps energy policy and foreign policy cuts right at the heart of Russia’s top export- 48.5% of their top export is energy(oil,gas)...the next 9 combined barely= 22%..when you take any approach that cuts into that it cuts at their entire livelihood.
3330 2018-07-24 17:21:22 Only until the 2018 elections are finished I'm guessing.

Unless it's bankers, hedge fund managers or oil execs. The GOP will make sure those guys get every conceivable entitlement or tax break.

If 61.8% could define all trading activities, there would be no room for 69.7%. The fact is they have different missions in trading. I just need more time to figure out how they react to the price actions of markets.

3444 2018-07-24 17:08:54 Margaret Thatcher used a lot of sticks: Like breaking the hold of the Unions, using the Miners Strike to manufacture consent via the media, stricter labour laws (no closed shop). Carrots: there was the ramp up of North Sea oil and a lot of Council Houses to sell (new Tories)...
3445 2018-07-24 17:08:48 Good call – especially if it's a VW/European car shop – the 1.8T has a few specific things to look out for.

Does the car come with any kind of service history? The big killers of those engines are missed oil changes and using the wrong oil and coolant.
3446 2018-07-24 17:08:45 Aww you poor thing. You forgot to check your oil level? ^RF @carahlina

3448 2018-07-24 17:08:39 I need an oil change and I’m basically broke
3449 2018-07-24 17:08:33 But seriously, it doesn't bother you at all that he was attacking $TSLA #Tesla for his clients in the oil industry? Is this how you want business to be done? Is this how you want the free market to work? You want the market to be based on lies, FUD and hidden agendas?
3450 2018-07-24 17:08:27 Yes ! Same girl same . It’s so hard to find a combo that won’t over dry or give excess oil / breakouts 
3451 2018-07-24 17:08:11 Oil rig?  Two family members worked on them.
3452 2018-07-24 17:08:10 Came to a concert and I had a vitamin-c face oil in my bag and the women checking my bag told me I had to either throw it away or coat check it...so guess who coat checked face oil? 
3453 2018-07-24 17:08:03 Best place to get an oil change??? Help
3454 2018-07-24 17:08:00 #Tillerson did after all get the Order of Russia medal. And first action was Russian-Saudi alliance to cut oil production to pump up price.
3455 2018-07-24 17:07:41 @loumanfredini  I need help please  a weird gasoline odor appeared in my house on Friday. There is oil on my basement rug in the corner and no one can figure it out. Smell is strong! Have had Nicor, my village services, a plumber and PermaSeal out!!! What should my next step be?
3456 2018-07-24 17:07:41 sebelum mandi bersihin juga pake micellar water/cleansing oil, trus pakein toner, dirawat sama kayak wajah
3457 2018-07-24 17:07:41 ...I recall there was a hearing where PREPA`s purchase of dirty oil from Brazil at inflated prices was mentioned - but sadly nothing came of it.
3458 2018-07-24 17:07:39 unless you come from oil money best you can do is 4 convenience stores or laundromats
3459 2018-07-24 17:07:38 Kayanya si lebih baik pake oil atau mc.. kalo pake kapas km ngusap selama 4 menit takutnya ga baik si
3460 2018-07-24 17:07:36 Time now to demand canceling the Carbon Tax. Certainly the Conservatives will do it in 2019. Push for better strategies by all means possible incl social media, radio and TV. Demand that the oil flows out of Alberta. And priority to public safety in Canada.
3461 2018-07-24 17:07:32 'Oil and natural gas fracking, on average, uses more than 28 times the water it did 15 years ago, gulping up to 9.6 million gallons of water per well and putting farming and drinking sources at risk in arid states, especially during drought.1 Jul 2015' UK Gov-learn from the US!

3468 2018-07-24 17:07:10 Knife (korea) you laugh and talk shit, when you go to lunch with your broke friends (allies) you pay so you choose where to eat. When there is another with a gun (putin)you don't talk shit,not does he, you discuss things that you have common interest in,oil,economy, etc. Simple.
3469 2018-07-24 17:07:09 Thank you!  It was for the 10th anniversary leatherbound edition a couple of years ago.  The original oil painting is hanging in Brandon Sanderson's house!

3472 2018-07-24 17:06:43 I need to get an oil change & my tires rotated but I don’t wanna go by myself lmao
3473 2018-07-24 17:06:40 Nothing was deleted and in fact a link was provided because the opposition can’t handle googling the studies.  But let’s talk about all that fake money oil and gas is supposedly bringing in...yet taxpayers are subsidizing the industry. I also provided a link to that too. #broke
3474 2018-07-24 17:06:37 Both edibles and vapes of cannabis oil are on the uptrend in the USA while flower is flat. Vapes have less odour and a predictable experience that users enjoy and so do neighbours for not noticing smell. Edibles bring a more intense experience thus a niche against vapes & flower
3475 2018-07-24 17:06:20 Think of it like finishing a wooden bowl, Philip. You start by carving the thing, gouging out large chunks.  Then move to a smaller gouge, sand paper of increasingly finer grades, and oil/wax etc.  All steps are necessary, but it would look rough without that slow, gentle finish.
3476 2018-07-24 17:06:17 India is not oil exporting country.
3477 2018-07-24 17:06:10 @realDonaldTrump Texas can't get more oil to the market without more pipeline, So where is YOUR infrastructure plan?
3478 2018-07-24 17:06:07 I should be able to pay someone to take my car for a oil change and car wash. It should be a thing.
3479 2018-07-24 17:05:45 Perhaps @NonGMOProject  isn’t aware of the dangers of rapeseed oil.
3480 2018-07-24 17:05:33 US Blocks Iran Oil trade in international markets directly results in spiking of oil prices which benefits Netanyahu, Saudis & also US energy companies. You don't see Dems crying about that. Top Dems leaders like Schumer are Israeli agents. No exaggeration.
3481 2018-07-24 17:05:28 I sleep with my hair pushed up like that in a pineapple. Water and oil in a spray bottle in the morning then shake your head and your will fall back it’s place. May need you hands for finishing touches but for the most part you’ll be good 
3482 2018-07-24 17:05:18 You’re such an angel ! Ive been using black castor oil and its amazing but i need a deep treatment for slacking 
3483 2018-07-24 17:05:12 All this beauty and so much potential and still the government is blind by oil money.
3484 2018-07-24 17:05:10 I'm not sure if i'm going to bleach it yet, i usually bleach my hair everytime i redye it i use only 6% peroxide but it seems light enough. I'll probably end up bleaching it anyways  and yes argan oil is so good, i need to start using that again haha

3492 2018-07-24 17:04:25 brilliant - guess you guys realise the oil story is coming to an end. A new generation will soon embrace renewable energy then believe in the power of national or corporate oil
3493 2018-07-24 17:04:20 Coconut oil is best used on the face or skin at night... When used during the day and skin is exposed to sunlight, it darkens the skin
3494 2018-07-24 17:04:19 Men can just hear the sound your car is making and know what’s wrong. I turn my music up when I hear a problem, but my brothers are like “sounds like your oil hasn’t been changed in 14,680 miles, your tailpipe is loose, and there’s a small leak in your front left tire”
3495 2018-07-24 17:04:16 I may have to take an aspirin because I left my peppermint oil and I’m only halfway through the work day  Help!
3496 2018-07-24 17:03:55 My dads making me start going to the dealer to get my oil change  what type of bs is this
3497 2018-07-24 17:03:46 By the US now selling oil to EU, a balance is being created so that Russia does not have complete energy leverage over Germany. With questions about POTUS' criticism, Putin could shrug and say, we're competitors. A reduction in R leverage=reduced chance of G having to join with R
3498 2018-07-24 17:03:31 And what better deal do Dems have?  Are they going to fight for #Medicare4All? College for all? Criminal justice reform? An end to wars to promote Big Oil? Renewable Energy? Or are they just going to continue to be moderate Republicans?
3499 2018-07-24 17:03:27 They obviously had been for the previous 27 years when there was a complete 100% unionisation. They only won the pay increase after 2 separate strikes, 2 judicial inquiries, an Arab oil embargo and a change of government.
3500 2018-07-24 17:03:22 im such a slut for olive oil
3501 2018-07-24 17:03:15 We had just moved into an apartment complex & had a power failure, so we lit our candles & oil lamps. All the neighbor kids came over to our place to see why we were only ones w power. Our candles & lamps were full & bright & our light attracted them! We're to live like that!
3502 2018-07-24 17:03:08 Ya it's garbage bro.  Difficult to find high quality olive oil.
3503 2018-07-24 17:03:05 Modi govt did nothing in last 4 years demono failure, rising prices after gst, bank scams, fuel prices, oil scams, hobnobbing with corrupt leaders jagan, gali, narayan rane, naresh agarwal, mukul roy, nirav modi, choski,etc
3504 2018-07-24 17:02:54 I find rapeseed oil in many organic. Even #NonGMO project verified will certify rapeseed oil.
3505 2018-07-24 17:02:50 I agree that oceans aren't the place to "store" plastic, that's common sense, isn't it?

YouTube has a video where a Japanese guy invented a machine that could turn any plastic back into oil for fuel.
3506 2018-07-24 17:02:42 -Soak in hot water til they're soft.
-Wash thoroughly, ensuring to remove sand from within the wrinkles.
-Boil for 15-20 minutes.
-Fry in very little (olive) oil.
-Add ketchup (and if you like them baba, chilli sauce). Fry on til the ketchup's all up in 'em.
-Eat while still hot.

3511 2018-07-24 17:02:18 Tech stocks are selling off after big jump this morning. Banks and oil have momentum
3512 2018-07-24 17:02:17 Don't deform my words...on a basic level, I am not against the development of agriculture but palm oil is only pure monoculture and it brings only enrichment for big companies owning these crops.
3513 2018-07-24 17:02:14 I hear you Mntase but were you there at the negotiations? Why is that the countries that we supply oil to have cheaper fuel prices?
3514 2018-07-24 17:02:12 The oil neeeeeds a pump!!! That’s really the only specific preference I have when it come to hair products. I’ve had sooo many oils in glass containers with no pump and I jus waste so much by pouring it . But sooo excited for you!!

3516 2018-07-24 17:02:00 It's all about the oil; How autocratic regimes in the Caucus are supported by German aid in their unquenchable thirst for oil. How this impacts the lives of natives living there.
3517 2018-07-24 17:01:47 Did Congress ever investigate why Prepa consistently overpaid for their oil contracts?
3518 2018-07-24 17:01:36 Michelle

3521 2018-07-24 17:01:22 Did you market snake oil before or do you just naturally have an aptitude

3523 2018-07-24 17:01:06 Brainwashed buyers/ UMMAH is ready to accept anyone selling green snake oil!
3524 2018-07-24 17:01:04 A socialist movement would be one to nationalize our major industries. Something we may need when it comes to say, oil which we subsidize and allow profiteers of to thwart our values, institutions and security for. "Medicare for all" ain't that. That's just basic human decency.
3525 2018-07-24 17:00:58 oilちゃんおやすみなさい(*´ω`*)

3538 2018-07-24 16:59:57 In other news, Trudeau’s trust fund has gained 19% in 2018. An overweight position in offshore oil has fueled its growth.
3539 2018-07-24 16:59:48 The brand is nature bounty, it’s 100%  pure tea tree and I don’t dilute it I know some people do. I used to get keloids on my piercing so much and would just use sea salt water but once I used tea tree oil I never got them again
3540 2018-07-24 16:59:45 Look I’m asking you~ WHAT DO YOU WANT. 

Do you guys want an apology? Because if you want that you can’t get it by starting new fanwars. It’s not how it works.

Look through twitter, you guys call Daesung a MURDERER and our GD a DRUG ADDICT. You added oil to TOP’s case.
3541 2018-07-24 16:59:36 Hit up the essential oil isle.(peppermint, lavender, lemon, grapefruit)  Take an Epsom salt bath. My advice. Hope you feel better soon.
3542 2018-07-24 16:59:22 Oh girlllll just slap some coconut oil and look at the sky all day you should be good soon 
3543 2018-07-24 16:59:10 @realDonaldTrump How come we can pump oil through long pipelines to port but we don´t have pipelines delivering water from flood prone areas to the west coast ?
During the spring lots of floodwater could be stored in The Hoover Dam to replenish The Colorado River !
3544 2018-07-24 16:59:01 I really doubt that many companies signed 3-year fixed contracts with no out clause when oil prices were so low in 2015-16. But, then again, dumb is dumb.
3545 2018-07-24 16:59:00 So, I know a Nigerian politician/oil business man, in my estate that might be in jail, but then he has 2 constructions going on in the same estate.

3546 2018-07-24 16:58:59 Can I help you with your sun tan oil? 
3547 2018-07-24 16:58:58 This could be asked of all snake oil sold over the centuries. If the technology isn't real, the employed scientists and doctors who could be improving patient lives won't be.

The FDA and universities won't allow $COOL to sell SkinTE in bulk. We have no affect on their actions.
3548 2018-07-24 16:58:50 @EdLatimore update to a discussion we had previously: looked more into whether federal employees could take CBD oil and found that since the DEA declared indirectly that CBD is a Schedule 1 drug it is NOT allowable for a fed employee to take it. Lovely drug laws.

3552 2018-07-24 16:57:58 thanks to Obama policies for 8 years. economics take longer than your 2013 Russian election strategy. remember 2008 financial collapse? Obama saved this country, and killed Osama. you just made Russia rich again. nothing else. oil barrel prices makes Putin rich. #dummydon
3553 2018-07-24 16:57:51 So my car was beeping because I had no oil. Well done sis.
3554 2018-07-24 16:57:38 Climate change does require active choices by people in oil companies to continue doing what they're doing every day, including spending big bucks on climate denial and lobbying against reform
3555 2018-07-24 16:57:34 Stop dying it, fish oil & biotin 
3556 2018-07-24 16:57:33 It's so sad how young kids are getting denied school because schools won't let them take there CBD oil for many illnessess. Like do you think those little ones want to be sick do you think they want to be dependent on anything! Society makes me sick!
3557 2018-07-24 16:57:32 Plastic trash can be converted to oil.
Plastic trash can be reused to build houses
Plastic bottles can be used to make boats

In short there is definitely huge things we could do with plastic, the problem is lack of incentive to save our own habitat and greedy short term vision
3558 2018-07-24 16:57:07 Literal translation: Mmanu Okwa is the oil used to make Okwa. Usually fresh, very good oil. 

The phrase means fresh, fine Ada

3562 2018-07-24 16:56:50 Shouts out to @valvoline for having me wait in line for 27 minutes only to tell me they can’t change my oil 
3563 2018-07-24 16:56:41 Give it a go, you might as well. And as you say, can always go back if you're not keen on it. If you're bleaching first, I'd give it a couple of days before doing the next colour. If you have time, dip the ends of your hair in argan oil and leave it like that over night
3564 2018-07-24 16:56:40 DaPud needs his shots and Shelly needs an oil change
3565 2018-07-24 16:56:35 Legacy of past deficits impedes running a big deficit now (imo).   Stock imbalance and all.

and think the US should be saving at least some of its current oil windfall ...

deficit in manufactures is back at peak levels, so that hasn't happened. improvement in oil balance offset

3568 2018-07-24 16:56:17 Revamping our military & giving them billions, arming Ukraine, RU sanctions, largest oil exporter, increased funding to NATO, calling out Germany for giving RU billions, 4%+ US GDP. 

None of this is good news or helps Russia, yet it is all because of @Potus + GOP not Democrats.
3569 2018-07-24 16:56:12 Nothing. Its not even Ramaphosa's fault. The leading oil producing countries are supplying "less" oil which increases its price range.

3573 2018-07-24 16:56:03 It is because I live in Germany and have been to said Iceland that I feel this way about Canada. Scandinavian countries have  very low imigration, have huge oil reserves and have been egalitarian for centuries before the term was coined. Its not a fair comparison.
3574 2018-07-24 16:56:02 Sensitive people and me are like oil and vinegar. Which is funny because I really don't think I'm that outrageous.

3576 2018-07-24 16:55:55 Hi Iran has done nothing to the US it hasn't bombed or killed an American. But we have been responsible for killing many Iranians. Just saying. Got to keep perspective. Iran is rich in oil and we know how that story goes. Look at Libya Iraq Syria #MAGA2018 #ProtectThe Children

3582 2018-07-24 16:55:27 I know they automate that, which leads to silly results, but I always wonder what happens when you actually buy one and then make a warranty claim when the oil runs out. Do they actually replace the oil, or just refund the warranty and disable it for that product?
3583 2018-07-24 16:55:26 Dangote Refinery would need the Niger Delta Oil for exports..his refinery is very close to the creeks..
3584 2018-07-24 16:55:22 I’ve been using saline and a mix of coconut oil with lavender religiously and it’s worked wonders! Also I heal really well, so I’m definitely grateful for that

*every year*, right about this time the "iranians" threaten
to shut down the strait of  hormuz and the oil pit runs up the

shortly thereafter, *suddenly, the "iranian" threat dissipates

3594 2018-07-24 16:54:35 Great gesture by President Museveni and PM Modi in elevating Indo Ugandan relationship. Recall warm reception by Ugandans to me when I worked in Ugandan oil industry for a year in 2014. Indo Ugandan relationship has large potential and both can help each other immensely

Still I admire, envy your perspective.

3611 2018-07-24 16:52:41 I'm actually deeply uncertain about this, the qualitative nature of the UK economy is such that I think a degree of protectionism could be deeply re distributive. The shift from coal/manufacturing base to oil/financial base is the structural bedrock of UK inequality.

3615 2018-07-24 16:52:07 Drilling in places where nature is relatively untouched, or considered sacred land to natives, breaks my heart. Why ruin what we have left of nature, why not try and find better alternatives to oil. Why not push science in order to advance. Why be ignorant.
3616 2018-07-24 16:52:06 Talked to my nurse practitioner this morning about being put on paxil, since it has worked for me in the past. She also recommended that I take probiotics, vitamin D (already taking), and fish oil to help produce the sertonin in my gut.

We have the ability to treat the planet right, so we should instead of being dependent on oil that is meant to cool Earth
3626 2018-07-24 16:51:19 To keep your lawn mower in peak operating condition, schedule routine service throughout the season. Basic maintenance should include replacing the air filter, sharpening blades and changing engine oil, and once a year have the fuel filters, spark plugs and oil filters replaced.

3632 2018-07-24 16:50:29 - and the messed up sleeping schedule, I'm just stressing myself out again. 

I try to avoid painkillers because meh, I already take enough of those when I get headaches. Buuut, we'll see tomorrow. Oil or a heat pack could be an option too. Wish I had thought of that sooner haaa.

3645 2018-07-24 16:49:32 I forgot to when I was there last for a failed oil sending unit.  It looks like there are a few aftermarket throttle response correctors on the market, so I'm guessing it's factory programming to meet CAFE regulations. I'll bring it in to make sure it's working properly.

3835 2018-07-24 16:32:11 Seeing what Qatar is doing with their oil money makes me wonder if GHANA is drilling and selling groundnut oil, coconut oil or Frytol cooking oil.

3847 2018-07-24 16:31:09 President Trump's right again. Does anyone recall a time that the world has not been held hostage to OPEC & their oil price manipulation? Well now there's a countervailing force as America not only becomes energy independent but an energy exporter. Can anyone smell freedom? I do!
3848 2018-07-24 16:31:07 So I have to go do something called an oil change ....?

3850 2018-07-24 16:31:02 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
3851 2018-07-24 16:30:38 Donald Trump is doing a great job. Forget the Democratic bot responses below. Trump is rearming Eastern Europe, strengthening our military, and encouraging Germany to switch to American oil.

3861 2018-07-24 16:29:52 Try when they were less than .25 and a guy came out and pumped it for you and checked your oil, water and washed your windows.

And remember the ding ding when you drove in?
3862 2018-07-24 16:29:50 Because most economics professors these days are supply-side snake oil salesmen.

3869 2018-07-24 16:29:04 Take ur oil farrell
3870 2018-07-24 16:28:58 Its a great pity that US does not use its brain to invent something that replaces fossil fuels before someone else does rendering oil worthless.
3871 2018-07-24 16:28:57  how do they do it ? A cream? Oil ?
3872 2018-07-24 16:28:56 Inflation adjusted, the price at the moment is barely above the average per barrel since 1980. Certainly well below the post 2000 average which makes tight oil production economical vs. large scale multi-year big capex projects.
3873 2018-07-24 16:28:45 I hate it when I'm washing my man and then I run of coconut oil and I still need to prepoo his beard. 
3874 2018-07-24 16:28:37 2: All travelers must comply with federal law on transporting marijuana and cannabis infused products, such as CBD oil, on board a flight. Our officers are required to notify law enforcement officers if they discover these products while screening your property.

3876 2018-07-24 16:28:27 @FoxNews Iranians threaten to close the Straits of Hormuz, a major oil transport shipping lane. Surely, Iran should nos expect the 7th Fleet and its US Carrier Task Force Groups to be on the horizon soon in the Arabian Sea. #SevereConsequences
3877 2018-07-24 16:28:05 That's is what the northern part of Nigeria is afraid of they  dont want to be in a situation like niger that's a landlocked country so no restructuring no problem with all the oil well in Nigeria

3879 2018-07-24 16:27:52 @potus is following Teddy Roosevelt's "speak softly and carry a big stick." policy. Hitting Russia in Syria and Ukraine, spending more on defense, enabling oil production while soft-soaping Putin.
3880 2018-07-24 16:27:51 i have to get an oil change this weekend and that sucks really bad
3881 2018-07-24 16:27:51 Not sure I follow you.  I was just surprised that Houston was higher than L.A. even with the oil biz. But the L.A. figure seems to show there are people making a lot and ppl making very little with not much in between.

3884 2018-07-24 16:27:39 So many questions.  What will happen in the fall when the oil sanctions kick in.  What role will Russia play?  Will ISIL grow again?
3885 2018-07-24 16:27:33 Use a little natural oil (coconut, lavender, orange, etc) with that foot rub to make it extra special. Sounds like an excellent idea, just back from my daily 5 mile hike.
3886 2018-07-24 16:27:23 Came across this campaign by farmers #STOP
S- stop using white processed sugar (alternates: coconut or palm sugar, jaggery, honey)
T- use 8mg of turmeric everyday in food.
O- Cold pressed oil is safest.
P-use Pulses grown in India(packages should contain information of source)
3887 2018-07-24 16:27:22 The simple fact is that tight oil isn't economical at prices during the OPEC market flood. Lower break-even "efficiency improvements" were mostly cutting staff and salaries in the downturn, which is unsustainable nonsense.

If the world wants more oil, it'll have to pay for it.
3888 2018-07-24 16:27:04 Let me guess, you think natural gas is "clean" and oil is bad?

Do you like plastic?

Where do they find natural gas?
3889 2018-07-24 16:26:59 @realDonaldTrump is bitter bitter bitter to the bone CA wholeheartedly rejected him and his agenda of racism, greed, war mongering, destroying environmental protections, water, lands, food, education, etc. bigly! He wants our resources, esp oil drilling, for his donors.
3890 2018-07-24 16:26:58 Reason and religion. Oil and water, oh learned one.
3891 2018-07-24 16:26:41 No.  They went to war using deception to get the support of the American people but the purpose was not oil.  What sense does it make to spend trillions of dollars and sacrifice thousands of lives for oil that you could buy for a lot cheaper?  It's much more complex.
3892 2018-07-24 16:26:41 Just released my soldiers OMG I need a glass of milk.
@KraksTV
3893 2018-07-24 16:26:35 I laugh at this comment.   Obummer almost destroyed Us Those “experts”, lol, are the same that said if crude oil dropped below $50 and sustained, would Bkrpt us, but in 2003 were saying if it rose above $40 would Bkrpt us—which is it genius?   Tarriffs win in this situation.
3894 2018-07-24 16:26:25 I know this feeling. My friends stabbed me in the back when my uncle got cancer, said I was 'fucking crazy' for trying to find a cure. I went to one of them for help getting cbd oil for my cousin and they said "just cut her tits off, no tit no cancer"
3895 2018-07-24 16:26:13 I’m getting an oil change and this is the first time I’ve been to a place where the car owner stays in the car for the entirety of the process. Wild.
3896 2018-07-24 16:26:09 Shows the Democrats don't care nor want their special interests. Democrats control most T.V. funny how they don't b*tch about big oil, pharmacy, or cancerous chemicals in our food.

3911 2018-07-24 16:24:36 And in a "silent tariff" on oil, dotard Trump does the Kremlin's bidding, threatening Iran, creating turmoil in oil markets, and boosting Putin's personal fortune. I wonder who's paying those higher oil prices at the pump?
3912 2018-07-24 16:24:35 Excuse me... look at the Russian oil production.... sanctions have had no impact... it's been growing all along
3913 2018-07-24 16:24:28 I've been listening to Oil of Every Pearl's Un-insides. Like dubstep made by radio-wielding carmaking robots.

3916 2018-07-24 16:24:01 @mitchellreports The general is stating that Iran can block the Strait of Hormuz in a matter of days with mines and it could take us weeks or months to reopen it. Thats all about OIL folks! Prices at our pumps will spike!
3917 2018-07-24 16:23:48 Waiting for @Everton to announce a summer signing is like waiting for oil based gloss to dry before being able to apply a second coat.
3918 2018-07-24 16:23:48 I got an oil change today, and I met this Nurse who is about to retire from Parkland, so you know she is wise. We had the best conversation and she gave me advise that I’ll keep forever.

Moral of the story: be kind and talk to strangers!!!!

3925 2018-07-24 16:22:53 I'm mostly talking about using it for energy in transportation and the electrical generation.  I have no problem with other products made from oil but those are drops in the bucket. What's funny is oil wouldn't be as cheap if we had to pay for the environmental and health costs.
3926 2018-07-24 16:22:50 Anne’s hair oil is really good ! 

Also argan and castor oil

3955 2018-07-24 16:20:34 @realDonaldTrump  SIR, IF IRAN WOULD CLOSE THE STRAIGHTS OF HORMUZ , WILL YOU SUSPEND OIL FROM TRADING ON THE STOCK MARKET TO KEEP THE SPECULATORS FROM RAISING THE PRICE AND MAKING A FORTUNE FOR THEIR ADVANTAGE OF GREED????
3956 2018-07-24 16:20:32 Releasing some oil from the strategic reserves might help too. Guess they don't want the economy growing too fast and have to raise rates.
3957 2018-07-24 16:20:31 Being 100% honest here, try mayo instead of butter/oil too
3958 2018-07-24 16:20:23 The world is the looser to this oil battle.
The cancellation of the nuclear deal,and sanctions didn't see the consequences.
Now its affecting ordinary people

3961 2018-07-24 16:19:58 One trillion due to t rumps crap in 2 years. We can get on top of debt and take care of people. We can heal this earth, get off oil and feed the world. 
3962 2018-07-24 16:19:57 Fantastic news! I guess that they are also going to cull subsidies for oil, gas, nuclear too? Oh, and won’t be bankrolling North Sea cleanup.  It’ll be wonderful to have renewables competing on equal terms.
3963 2018-07-24 16:19:56 Grabe kaw bes, you roasted me in my own oil. Haha
3964 2018-07-24 16:19:47 Only thing bad about fried foods is the type of flour and oil we commonly use in the US
3965 2018-07-24 16:19:42 peppermint is the go-to essential oil for staying cool truly works. but its so potent scented. pretty sure everyone thinks have a drinking issue & hiding a bottle of peppermint schnappes in my pocketnot even noon and my office is 83.
3966 2018-07-24 16:19:31 Yes--but could still be a region with federally operated fields actually--that's the Baghdad interpretation of the Constitution. Basra could, under the constitution, have a stronger say in how oil operations, contracts are carried out. More like 90% of oil production I think.

3980 2018-07-24 16:18:35 Thinks the petrodollar is the oil.
Clearly has no clue what the petrodollar mechanism is and why the countries in the ME were attacked or disrupted to defend it.
Of course throws in more potty mouth.
3981 2018-07-24 16:18:23 When people talk about real wages suddenly going flat, what we’re really seeing is nominal wage gains staying steady while inflation has picked up, led in part by rising energy prices. A few years ago real wages shot up when oil price collapse pulled inflation to nearly zero.
3982 2018-07-24 16:18:19 Topically
*Place 2-3 drops of essential oils directly on the desired area and rub in.
*Always follow labels instructions.
*Caution essential oils are very potent and may irritate skin. Add any pure oil to dilute. *Citrus-based oils may cause temporary photosensitivity

3983 2018-07-24 16:18:15 I remember when I first started growing out my hair I’d cop out on Shea moisture, but I dead haven’t used any products beside some coconut oil here and there and lots of water for like that last 6 months. I prefer no products tbh
3984 2018-07-24 16:18:10 What's better, vegetable oil, coconut oil, butter or something else for weed cooking?
3985 2018-07-24 16:18:03 I am sitting in a pub listening to two twenty something lads talk about ugly and pretty girls an eye opener as they are not oil paintings themselves! 
3986 2018-07-24 16:17:57 Cherry Blossom trees are from Asia! We created our own using construction paper, oil pastels and tissue paper. Beautiful!
3987 2018-07-24 16:17:53 coconut oil gave me three years of cystic acne! I didn’t know anything about my skin to know that was what was causing it - never again
3988 2018-07-24 16:17:47 I dropped my phone between the seats in my dads truck after an oil change and I cant find it or get it out or get someone to call it 

hey twitter help im all out of options
3989 2018-07-24 16:17:40 LOL so the US cares about OIL and asks the UN for help, but ignores what the UN says about Julian Assange. Forked tongue much?
3990 2018-07-24 16:17:25 Fair enough, but if the cut is in fact representative of stable supply, in a mkt facing supply reductions, there is a looming supply crunch.  Benefits to oil producers, or how proceeds spent,notwithstanding.
3991 2018-07-24 16:17:22 ひゃーす！

3992 2018-07-24 16:17:15 Yep. So many years of oil, coal, and Fox muddying the waters, so to speak, that deniers and low information voters think settled scientific consensus is actually highly controversial. #ClimateChangeIsReal
3993 2018-07-24 16:17:14 So Paul Biya signed over Cameroon’s oil to Russia, Japan, China, Switzerland, UK, France some other countries TWENTY FIVE years in advance ?!!!!
3994 2018-07-24 16:17:07 Ok, but since it concentrates more than 70% of all oil production in Iraq, it might not happen. Anyway it’s very interesting to observe how protests are developing and I get your point

3999 2018-07-24 16:16:34 It's a simple choice, we either frack, buy Middle Eastern oil and buy in also all the problems associated with dealing with despot oil kingdoms, or we go back to living as a primitive society?
4000 2018-07-24 16:16:32 lack of environmental stewardship and the destruction thereof -are not excusable by adhering to propaganda. it is whoredome of OIL, on the part of Russians and republicans, that is making the world unlivable.

4040 2018-07-24 16:12:51 He said “collusion’ was a hoax. Don’t think he’s thought on Russia?  Then how do you explain: Why he bombed Syria, nixed the Iran Deal, sent ships to the Black Sea, wants to increase NATO spending, armed the Ukraine, and castigated Germany for making oil deals with Russia?
4041 2018-07-24 16:12:33 Bio Oil and Cocoa Butter...mix them apply daily! You’re welcome!!
4042 2018-07-24 16:12:31 @AliVelshi the sudden posture toward Iran, is to engineer oil prices skyrocketing. Then he has an excuse to buy oil from Russia.

4044 2018-07-24 16:12:05 Of course. But I don’t think you understand that we would go back in time several hundred years without oil. You would eliminate the majority of prescription drugs, synthetic fabrics for clothes, consumer electronics, rubber, lubricants etc.

It's a simple case of overloading the system. We can use oil, just not more than the system can cope with. At the moment we use too much & nature can't cope with the increase.

4064 2018-07-24 16:09:25 Umm, our oil industry is mostly foreign owned. They pay very little tax here and take the profits home. Also the push is to use less oil, period.
4065 2018-07-24 16:09:11 If we would expand the Renewable Fuel Standard for biodiesel and renewable diesel, we could easily absorb the oil portion of these vegetables DOMESTICALLY.

4088 2018-07-24 16:07:36 Wtf canna believe some mink has stole my tanning oil

4090 2018-07-24 16:07:20 Trans girl tip: if you suffer from anxiety everyday when you leave the house, try CBD oil. It’s a non-psychoactive cannabanoid so you don’t get “high” (I freak out when I’m high during the day), it relaxes all your muscles and soothes your nerves.
4091 2018-07-24 16:07:16 Fire department people had to  break down the wall and there it waspoor baby stuck in the pipes ,they had to put oil so that they could slide it through cause its stuck
4092 2018-07-24 16:07:15 CPD by fear ... data/Ofsted/SIP/MAT/LA ....... takes real courage to ignore ..... but I can see headway.. think the oil tanker is turning... but by gum, it is slow....
4093 2018-07-24 16:07:12 That's why he bombed Syria, axed the Iran Deal, sent ships to the Black Sea, wants to increase NATO spending, armed Ukraine, and scolded Germany for making oil deals with Russia.
4094 2018-07-24 16:07:05 So, if I follow your use of the term "petrocratic," "Big Oil" has secretly placed its operatives at @wmata and at @ATULocal689 over the years to help ensure that metro is run in the most inefficient. expensive, and dysfunctional way possible. Very clever, those sneaky petrocrats!
4095 2018-07-24 16:07:01 sat here with coconut oil in my hair, munching on some mango slices and drinking some water. haven’t smoked in two days. who am i
4096 2018-07-24 16:06:56 When your mum sprays your face with feet spray rather than face oil now my eyes are burning 
4097 2018-07-24 16:06:53 1 Thatcher knew the Unions had the upper hand, so moved from industry to commerce, making the working class poorer and the upper richer. 2 She spent North sea oil revenue, and our pensions, to make UK look prosperous. All our money has gone, industry is the only way to regain it.
4098 2018-07-24 16:06:51 Purple shampoo and conditioner every other wash. And an oil treatment once a month to keep it shiny and healthy.
4099 2018-07-24 16:06:43 Dental implant industry would be bigger than oil 
4100 2018-07-24 16:06:19 Net Spend is a nice cover for teams spending a bunch of money, outside of City and PSG and their oil tycoons I dont care who spends, because for the most part its money earned being spent
4101 2018-07-24 16:06:14 If you put a little olive oil through it before pouring hot water over it helps fluff

4104 2018-07-24 16:05:49 What has anyone used for hair growth products? 
I'm using castor oil right now. 
Tysabri has made me lose some of my head hair and I wanna regrow my eyebrows too.
4105 2018-07-24 16:05:18 USA can't sustain a fight with Iran
Any war with Iran will lead to a defeat of America
It will add to the American debt 
Will shoot up global oil prices
4106 2018-07-24 16:05:13 Do you have a favorite essential oil? What do you like most about it?
4107 2018-07-24 16:05:10 I don't think Farridge is far right. Just right wing. And I expect a global oil company and a data gathering marketing company to just be fine with it. Let's not try to look like we're stifling debate
4108 2018-07-24 16:05:07 Anyone else find it kind of concerning that the vast majority of #YouTube ads now seem to be entrepreneur bros peddling their particular snake oil secrets at worst, and endless Wix and Udemy spots at best?
4109 2018-07-24 16:04:55 money spent for nothing! 2017 street glide still under warranty. They will not replace a $13.00 oil sending switch that is bad because light doesn't stay on all time ,so rider cannot tell if he has oil pressure or not. Manual says to stop engine. warranty is shit
4110 2018-07-24 16:04:51 ㅇ..아......아.......... 귀능다나...ㄴ너무 예뻐.....
4111 2018-07-24 16:04:41 Magnus just rubbed the oil into Alec’s skin, making sure it was fully absorbed before he stood. He tilted his head, looking at the sleeping face of the man he loved for a moment before quietly putting the oil away and washing his hands.
4112 2018-07-24 16:04:28 Just spent $85 on a oil change. I’m sad asf lmfao
4113 2018-07-24 16:04:14 @papushatech is the latest technology to destroy oil refineries residues around the world. Instead of destroying flora and fauna,refineries get gasoline and diesel fuel for selling. #ICO #Crowdsale #Bitcoin
4114 2018-07-24 16:04:12 And question for digvijaya singh
Who is Amrita ,daughter or wife .
Digvijaya answered my wife .oh she is your wife .i will gifted you 200 pack of sanda oil.
4115 2018-07-24 16:04:11 Except that it hasn't
I worked in mining, oil and chemical manufacture all my life
Those industries have gone but thanks to Thatcher & her successors we didn't invest in new high tech industries as she and Blair & though services was all we needed
They are going to be hit hard
4116 2018-07-24 16:04:01 & it was a huge rig. When the oil spills it could be dangerous for the oily tongued Pathological liars administration!
4117 2018-07-24 16:03:56 Ka humot ba sa tea tree oil
4118 2018-07-24 16:03:51 ugh i need my peppermint oil essential oils right now or I'll probably die
4119 2018-07-24 16:03:49 And filing longshot lawsuits against big oil companies.
4120 2018-07-24 16:03:49 A licked oil package, detergent with mess etc
4121 2018-07-24 16:03:47 Taxing an invisible, pretty near harmless gas is ... like being able to see the emperors new clothes.
4122 2018-07-24 16:03:40 I have 34% on my phone and have to wait on two cars to get their oil changed :’)
4123 2018-07-24 16:03:39 #NeverTrump is a fringe cause at this point, based upon polling. The fact that they’re pushing for carbon taxes that would directly & deeply hurt American businesses show they’re nothing more than globalists who want American industry to wilt and die, not “true conservatives”.
4124 2018-07-24 16:03:26 FREE MARKET CAPITALISM!! unless your buddy's oil company, car manufacturer, airline, coal plant, coal mine, big bank, or hedge fund need help. #GOPhypocrites
4125 2018-07-24 16:03:08  I think it was the perfume oil I bought on the street the other day. I just tried it 
4126 2018-07-24 16:03:00 When cleaning floor and a few drops of rosemary oil to water
4127 2018-07-24 16:02:53 Before for me. I use a spray bottle with water and coconut oil then mousse then gel
4128 2018-07-24 16:02:42 Under Zuma:
SA Oil reserves sold 
Eskom Transnet looted
SAA failed/bailouts
Road Accident Fund Denel in financial trouble 
SARS under collect
He covered corruption & House of  Cards was going 2 collapse under Zuma by 2019 but he didnt care he just wanted access 2 last resources
4129 2018-07-24 16:02:26 I agree, but point I would make is that it's impossible to know with cryptos. BTC has the lowest volatility of all the coins and it still ranges from 100-200%. As a comparable, crude oil and natural gas (not exactly stagnant markets) vol ranges from 25-30%
4130 2018-07-24 16:02:22 I have type 2 diabeties and hope one day to be off of it I use a lot of cocounut oil and Apple Cider Vinager and I try to eat a lot of small meals everyday
4131 2018-07-24 16:02:19 Me too, they will want you to be re-elected until oil prices get driven up, so Putin’s company can start making lots of money, and you, unlike others, can be manipulated, you’ve proven that by standing with Putin’s against your own Coutry
4132 2018-07-24 16:02:10 Drove all the way to my dealership to find out you have to schedule an appt to get an oil change so that’s how my day is going. Oh and I sat at the dentist for 3 hours while they did nothing and wasted my $4 for parking 
4133 2018-07-24 16:02:10 Yeah I use lots of coconut oil when I’ve just bleached it but after a while it almost goes back to normal
4134 2018-07-24 16:02:06 Lemon essential oil 
4135 2018-07-24 16:02:03 "It smells like cardamom oil." -Lee
4136 2018-07-24 16:02:00 I'd love to wash my face but I got a nasty oil spray burn on my face from cooking and yeah... Not gonna happen.
4137 2018-07-24 16:01:59 who do you think is pushing for everyone to put more $ towards NATO defense? and railed against the Germany/Russia oil agreement?
4138 2018-07-24 16:01:49 thinking of throwing a Fall themed party celebrating the day the coconut oil is solid again
4139 2018-07-24 16:01:47 A barrel of oil isn't really oil, its "what I can now do" that is being sold. The ability to produce a marginal barrel is worth "what i can now do even better" and the ability to set the price for "even better" is earned not given.
4140 2018-07-24 16:01:45 it gives Russian oil access to sea lanes
4141 2018-07-24 16:01:44 So Sad!
My room mate just broke up with the girl that used to give us food.
@KraksTV
4142 2018-07-24 16:01:36 If i were Trump i would offer to fly it to every event.. And replace the press plane with a plane full of Anti Trump protesters... Nothing is more pro Trump then a plane full of Anti Trump protesters and a stupid balloon.
4143 2018-07-24 16:01:34 Won't hurt US 'cause of shale oil,but will: 
1.Distract media from coup
2. Show base his big, swinging d&ck
3. Set up war for 2020 to win reelection, make $, & send more refugees to EU helping rightwing there. All good for autocrats 2 B able to carve up world to their liking
4144 2018-07-24 16:01:31 It’s a date. I am practically tasting some of that rich rich hummus and fresh pita bread with olive oil.
4145 2018-07-24 16:01:16 Amrita bhabhi  is also very laudable gesture to send 200 pack of sanda oil to digvijaya singh
4146 2018-07-24 16:01:10 Try castor oil, hair oil, and back to work in their own country.
4147 2018-07-24 16:01:06 The government of Thailand has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Chris Meloni in a vinyl coated polyester wig.
4148 2018-07-24 16:01:04 HAHAHA Well use some coconut oil in it every weekends to give it some moisture. I never dye my hair but it used to look like a haystack on my head and coco oil helped a loooot.
4149 2018-07-24 16:00:59 And public spending last year was £71 billion.   Over dependence on oil questionable strategy in face of increasing climate instability
4150 2018-07-24 16:00:57 40% of crude oil, 35% of nat gas, 32% of coal come from Russia. Stop cherry picking numbers. More than a quarter of Germany's energy is sourced from Russia.
4151 2018-07-24 16:00:49 Egg fried in olive oil < Egg fried in butter
4152 2018-07-24 16:00:41 Jojoba oil (when your hair is damp, no blow drying unless fully committed to a blow out). Trader Joe's has it, bottle can be leaky tho. Total game changer. I live in NC & it's pretty much the only thing I put in my wavy, frizzy hair. For heat styling I use a bit of moroccan oil.
4153 2018-07-24 16:00:32 Canadians do need to get this oil to market and stop buying oil and gas from Saudi Arabia and spending tones of cash. Build refineries here sell our oil invest the profits into new green energy solutions. Creat more jobs in new energy companies and fix ....

4156 2018-07-24 16:00:27 My car burns oil quickly for whatever reason, so I have to buy oil to supplement. And I do it myself until it needs an oil change. It shocks men to see me buying the oil, popping my hood and using the funnel to put the oil in 
4157 2018-07-24 16:00:22 Tell your Representatives: Stand up against oil and gas development in the #ArcticRefuge. http://1/#.W1dNDyQMYMI.twitter
4158 2018-07-24 16:00:21 They won't be happy until they've presented Canada with it's own version of Deepwater Horizon.  God I remember the oil company propaganda movies that were considered our audio/visual training when I was in grade school. We actually bought into their crap way back then.
4159 2018-07-24 16:00:18 Amen,@Comey was for prosecuting HC b4 he was against it:thinks "extremely careless"is not"gross negligence"& that Russia's Worst Nightmare of DT's Policies increasing NATO & US Military strength+decreasing its oil/gas market is not also #Putin's!Vlady knows what killed his #USSR!
4160 2018-07-24 16:00:18 I use their AFRI TRU products. They are affordable and do wonders for my hair. I mix their conditioner with coconut oil and olive oil, let it sit under a shower cap for an hour then rinse. Does wonders!
4161 2018-07-24 16:00:16 Everything is loaded through that area including coal etc and ONLY oil requires the escort of two tugs. It is by far the safest transport in the world. I doubt there will be much increased traffic over a 2 day load time at 300k additional cost for Burrard.
4162 2018-07-24 16:00:08 Truer words were never spoken: "We (American taxpayers) are the piggy bank being robbed."  Robbed by you, the GOP, your swamp denizens in office, and your GOP corporate, oil company, Wall Street, Big Pharma, NRA donors.

4170 2018-07-24 15:59:29 Trump authorized killing hundreds of Russians, sending Tomahawks to Syria, armed Ukraine with "Javeline" missles, and is ACTIVELY pushing out Russian oil from Ukraine. WTF are you talking about "Putn controls Trump?"
4171 2018-07-24 15:59:12 Production for the next video will start when I’m back home ! Burning that midnight oil today

4177 2018-07-24 15:57:57 South Africa has been experiencing fuel hikes in 2018 and Government is saying “ stronger Dollar nywee nywee and shit “ but that’s not the case. Oil price is on a 10 year low + OPEC have not cut their production + Mexico/Venezuela are unstable. Unfair petrol increases milking us
4178 2018-07-24 15:57:53 I want to start oil painting again but I also wanna work on props and also paint miniatures and watch movies and play through my backlog of games and also get caught up on my comics and work on model kits and also play magic and write dnd stuff when do I have time for shit! AAAA!
4179 2018-07-24 15:57:52 This is why as a gay man I refuse to associate myself with the "community." They are fucking crazy. I'm a dude. I like to do dude stuff... it just so happens I like doing dudes too... all that non-binary, cut off genitals shit confuses the hell out of me.
4180 2018-07-24 15:57:46 What meds do they have you on? Also lemon water or lemon drop candies help me. Also motion sickness oil that i got from Walmart in the motion sickness aisle with the dramamine. Oh and sea bands really worked too.
4181 2018-07-24 15:57:45 Psalm 23:4-5
 Even though I walk
through the darkest valley,[a]
I will fear no evil,
for you are with me;
your rod and your staff,
they comfort me.
You prepare a table before me
in the presence of my enemies.
You anoint my head with oil;
my cup overflows.
4182 2018-07-24 15:57:25 oil.
4183 2018-07-24 15:57:21 “No government handouts in MY America. Except tax breaks to billionaires and corporations. And subsidies to farmers getting crushed by a trade war this government started. And public lands to oil companies who donate to the GOP. And Visas to Mar-a-Lago guest workers- “
4184 2018-07-24 15:57:21 Beard oil is key
4185 2018-07-24 15:57:21 Invade, take their oil, you know. The usual.
4186 2018-07-24 15:56:56 I bet the US would invade my face since since it produces so much oil and I'm Arab
4187 2018-07-24 15:56:35 Nymex wti crude oil CL best SELLING Level is between  $69.70 to $70.20 stop loss $71.11 targets $69.30/$68.90/$68.55/$68.15
4188 2018-07-24 15:56:32 My advice Farmers.......sell your debt through carry forward losses, to high net partnerships with SEVERSHIP clauses, that don't bind assets to partnership flow through.

A tax shelter for well, like W. Bush's entire pre Government world of oil explorative LP partnerships.
4189 2018-07-24 15:56:21 oilが６８．９９まで上昇
4190 2018-07-24 15:56:19 I think OPEC is paying the @liberal_party & the @NDP to prevent Canadian oil from entering the world market. The OPEC nations refuse their own kind so they can imperil Canada with jihadism. OPEC must feel truly threatened by our cleaner,environmentally,humanely derived product.
4191 2018-07-24 15:56:06 Seeing what Qatar is doing with their oil makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling groundnut oil..  #copied
4192 2018-07-24 15:56:03 Oil pastel are an inexpensive and fun media to work with. If you're looking for something new
4193 2018-07-24 15:56:02 When did he say he wanted Trump to win?  Trump authorized killing hundreds of Russians, sending Tomahawks to Syria, armed Ukraine with "Javeline" missles, and is ACTIVELY pushing out Russian oil from Ukraine. WTF are you talking about "Putin wants Trump?"
4194 2018-07-24 15:55:45 Gettin my oil changed now after that need my brakes done
4195 2018-07-24 15:55:39 I keep hoping the #JeffSessions is burning the midnight oil getting iron tight indictments against this bunch ready for a surprise.
4196 2018-07-24 15:55:36 Except Kenya is predominately Christian whereas Somalia is Islamic. In that situation it's very rigid religions clashing like oil and water. Germany's neighbors are primarily Christian and as such: the EU's open border policies seem to be an economic and tourist benefit.
4197 2018-07-24 15:55:36 This is some serious disrespect, I would have poured them with boiling oil
4198 2018-07-24 15:55:34 You are an idiot. Them soldiers didn’t die protecting your freedom. They died because your leaders want oil. And also the freedoms you talk about are the same ones that give Americans the right to do what they want during the anthem. Unless you wish to live in a dictatorship.Stfu

4201 2018-07-24 15:55:20 My camera roll is just clusters of pictures of either plants or greyhounds that aren't mine broken up by memes, essential oil recipes I tell myself I'll use, and my best friend and I being unphotogenic.
4202 2018-07-24 15:55:12 He needs a holiday. Wonder would Kim Il Sung would give him a freebie...........He must need someone with connections in the oil industry. School holidays, so he could take the family.
4203 2018-07-24 15:55:12 i guess lush is the closest u can get to that atm? prices not too terrible, cruelty free, most vegan, minimizing packaging. pretty sure they still use plastic bottles for their shower gels tho and while theyre minimizing palm oil use they still use it
4204 2018-07-24 15:55:05 Ben- Trump is a snake oil salesman..... but you are brainwashed thinking that the liberals are any better. Trump is what he’s always been.... an unethical salesman/business man. Sure he lies, but THEY ALL LIE. There are no good guys or even better.... both sides are crap.
4205 2018-07-24 15:54:55 more strain-specific oil too would be nice
4206 2018-07-24 15:54:52 My car needs an oil change so I bought the filter and oil a couple weeks ago. & it’s when it started to get extra hot lmao. I should’ve just gone to get it changed with a mechanic. I won’t feel right asking my daddy to change it for me in this weather

4212 2018-07-24 15:54:33 I want to pick my oil based on dominant terpenes and thc/cbd ratios, which I'm sure is coming eventually.

4214 2018-07-24 15:54:27 #เมีย2018 อรุณา ฉันแนะนำให้เธอไปปรึกษามูลี่นะเรื่องการใช้ชีวิตหลังจากที่คิดจะหย่ากับผัว ถ้าเธอค่อยๆ คุยกับลูกทำความเข้าใจไปชีวิตเธอจะง่ายขึ้นเยอะ
4215 2018-07-24 15:54:18 I just paid my registration for my car last week $230
My car has an oil leak $140 JUST for an inspection this morning
My car payment is due on the 1st another $260 
Wtf man. Adulting sucks balls!
4216 2018-07-24 15:54:05 The bikers I know that voted for tRump are oil tycoons so since trump helped their investments they’ll probably see it as a trade?
4217 2018-07-24 15:54:04 Yeah, look at all the replies to the article tweet, not just this thread.  "Plastic lid," "snake oil," "may harm public health," "barely effective trinket"
4218 2018-07-24 15:54:02 You just lied. The fact that China buys over a quarter of Iranian oil exports means the people there have hopes other than trump. The only effect he poses is another deposed leader, country destabilized to maintain the petrocurrency kind of tale. See - Iraq and Libya.
4219 2018-07-24 15:53:48 My mom makes me use magnesium oil on my temples and arms and I think it works!
4220 2018-07-24 15:53:45 Add that to drilling in Alaska...with an abundance of oil in reserve???
4221 2018-07-24 15:53:29 The Golan Heights is not northern Israel! By the way when will you pay Syria for the oil that you have stolen?
4222 2018-07-24 15:53:24 Sanctions is useless when they’re selling their gas to Germany for billions. They rely on gas/oil to survive.

4227 2018-07-24 15:52:31 Putin’s oil IS the reason
4228 2018-07-24 15:52:29 Trump now says he’s going to help farmers hurt by his Trade War...what about manufacturing hurt by high steel costs? What about oil exporters? What about pig producers? What about auto manufacturing? What about consumers stuck with higher prices? We all vote too!
4229 2018-07-24 15:52:27 Just more distractions from the agenda that will open  National Parks and wildlife reserves to big industry ! Trump will destroy the American dream of going fishing with your son . Taking your family camping where next to the oil fields ??

4231 2018-07-24 15:52:24 Went to a tire depot today just asked 
How much would it be to change diff oil In a Jeep. 

worker: um well is it a automatic and what year, sport, rubicon,wrangler, 4 wheel drive ?  

 What the actual fuck does it matter  it’s oil......
4232 2018-07-24 15:52:23 Girllllll you need peppermint oil!
4233 2018-07-24 15:52:06 Use Paper ballots then bro. Let's import some oil from the rooskies as well

4236 2018-07-24 15:51:44 It’s the time where you get the plumpest, ripest heirloom tomato, put olive oil and garlic on some sourdough bread, toast it, top with that tomato and the prickliest fleur de sel and have your brain blown out, because it’ll be a year until you can taste a real tomato again.
4237 2018-07-24 15:51:40 I’m not wearing any face make up so I drenched my face in oil so quick.
4238 2018-07-24 15:51:38 Mfs get a job in the oil field and won’t shut the fuck up about it lmao with they boring ass

4240 2018-07-24 15:51:17 It pisses me off to see people use baby oil on their baby’s hair
4241 2018-07-24 15:51:16 My boss gave me two small jars of Josie Maran Argan oil and a little jar of whipped argan oil. 
4242 2018-07-24 15:51:16 Awe Iran will make us pay if we block oil to bad nobody cares about Iran or there products ..
4243 2018-07-24 15:51:04 discussion re Iran shutting Straits misses the point - don't have to completely shut Straits (nor can they for any length of time) for material impact on oil price.  But Iran can do many things to disrupt the Straits & have material impact on price & that seems very likely imo.
4244 2018-07-24 15:51:03 "Sacral" Oil is to stimulate your passion.  Are you feeling blah,  not sure where or what to do?   Do you feel a blockage in your creativity?  This oil is for you.
4245 2018-07-24 15:51:02 .@WarrenPies Negative sentiment towards oil due to electric vehicles is overblown. Reduction in oil demand due to electric vehicles is a drop in the bucket compared to overall consumption. #NDRInvest
4246 2018-07-24 15:50:54 SENATOR MURKOWSKI IS A OIL MONGER. SHE IS SHAMEFUL AND DISGUSTING. HOW DARE SHE SELL OUT HER MAJESTIC STATE. REMOVE HER FROM THE SENATE. SHE IS A BITCH!! She snuck that shit into trump's tax bill. HER!!
4247 2018-07-24 15:50:21 What are they signing? Crude oil pipeline to the Niger refinery? Gas pipeline to Niger? Refined products from Niger? Which is it?
4248 2018-07-24 15:50:21 I had no oil in my car which explains why my shit wasn’t going over 60 and a bad battery 
4249 2018-07-24 15:50:18 What happened to democracy and the voice of the people? The people of Lancs spoke and said no - but that doesn't count if the oil and gas lobby pay more... 
4250 2018-07-24 15:50:18 Oil all day long. Waterbased brush marks plus more coats oil  is the winner

4256 2018-07-24 15:49:17 Hey CBD Oil Purest thanks for the follow!
4257 2018-07-24 15:49:09 My brows are growing so fast. That castor oil works wonders
4258 2018-07-24 15:49:07 Perhaps in the same manner an oil boss did?
4259 2018-07-24 15:49:02 Howcome no one has looked in to who's funding those people? Are they also kremlin trolls, or being paid for by right-wing think tanks?

Way to make climate change a "sexy" cable news story is to focus on a conspiracy of deniers and oil companies out to destroy the planet 4 cash.
4260 2018-07-24 15:49:01 Did he get oil and vinegar on his sandwich?? Just wondering cause I’m hungry

4263 2018-07-24 15:48:21 And to think that in hour of service the entire farm produces, in terms of energy, the same as only 30 tons of oil extracted from that "tiny" platform. It alone generates more entropy than the whole farm saves.
4264 2018-07-24 15:48:08 We had to get an oil change this am, already drove 4500 miles

4270 2018-07-24 15:47:42 I prefer the Rapeseed Oil over Olive Oil any day
4271 2018-07-24 15:47:41 “If you fall asleep, that’s perfectly fine. I’m just here to make you relax.” Magnus kept up his motions, his hands sliding up and down Alec’s back before pausing the massage to grab more oil.
4272 2018-07-24 15:47:40 So they don’t know how to reset my oil change light. I’m giving them 5 more minutes before I just do it myself

4274 2018-07-24 15:47:30 What to eat at a restuarant and still lose fat

1. Order water or calorie free beverages
2. Get extra veggies without oil
3. Salad dressing on the side
4. Avoid starters and sweets
4275 2018-07-24 15:47:19 Idk about most houses, but my house has a wood burning furnace, and that’s the heat that comes out of our vents. Or we can turn the oil heat on.

4286 2018-07-24 15:46:31 How’s my oil short doing ? Good yeah?
4287 2018-07-24 15:46:29 I went to get an oil change today. An elderly man was behind me and decided to strike conversation. He goes “wow you’re beautiful”. I politely reply thank you. He then says “I want to stalk you on Facebook”. It went from sweet to weird real quick y’all.
4288 2018-07-24 15:46:26 I'm not "claiming" anything & not arguing global investment has plummeted. I'm noting one might mention that Saudi Aramco (producers), for example, makes money off a "supply crunch" & Aramco's profits don't just buy the next oil well, they have to sustain a country! Big picture
4289 2018-07-24 15:46:26 “The reality of the situation is that any oil spill, be it crude oil or diluted bitumen, represents a tragedy and catastrophe. It will harm the natural environment, will kill some marine organisms, and will be very hard to clean up.” @BlairKing_ca

4291 2018-07-24 15:46:21 It's trumps wag the dog to get people to forget about the collusion with Russia. Also he needs oil prices to go up for his oil buddies.
4292 2018-07-24 15:46:20 Need i remind u that #LFC is generating lots of profits or income compared to man u, real Madrid or Barca nor do their owners come from the oil industry like Chelsea, city and PSG. So wen I say we need moreno I mean we may hv even over spent as it is, to get a new LB.
4293 2018-07-24 15:46:16 Sana oil hahaha
4294 2018-07-24 15:46:13 The escalating heated exchanges this weekend between Trump and Iran's Rouhani are about oil. The Trump administration plans to impose strict oil sanctions against Iran this Fall, seeking to fully cut off the Iranian oil and natural gas sector from all nations.
4295 2018-07-24 15:46:00 Ross would be totally proud of me. The mower stopped working & I panicked because I had just put gas in it & emptied the bag. I checked the oil & it just wasn’t coming on. I was about to cry because Ross would be so disappointed I broke the mower 1st time mowing without him
4296 2018-07-24 15:45:45 about to get in touch with my inner women and get a oil burner
4297 2018-07-24 15:45:31 Oh did you mean a non bath option shampoo? The thing is I would get annoyed. Human put that healing honey on a wound. I didnt like it and ripped my furr out she tried coconut oil I did the same. I dont want to smell nice I want to smell of cat.
4298 2018-07-24 15:45:31 It’s possible that a snake oil salesman selling his book on “Therapeutic Juices” isn’t the best source for relationship advice.
4299 2018-07-24 15:44:56 @TheView @MeghanMcCain You forgot an important point in your argument using Venezuela as an example of socialism. They gained their wealth by oil and now oil is much cheaper then it was then almost half as much, foreign companies exodus due to Manduro's hostility and sanctions.
4300 2018-07-24 15:44:52 When will the apartheid state end the illegal occupation of the Golan Heights and its theft of water and oil there and pay reperations to Syria for this illegal exploitation of resorces for the apartheid state?

4302 2018-07-24 15:44:40 Meghan McCain is on The View talking about the demise of Venezuela like she's aware of how it actually happened. Had a whole lot to do with the US increasing oil production (under the Obama Administration), driving down oil costs, and destroying Venezula's oil economy.

4310 2018-07-24 15:44:06 The President signed an MoU with Niger to export their crude oil products to Nigeria. When we have enough crude of our own that we need to export. Not to mention that this is the same Niger he claims is responsible for Fulani herdsmen problems. A fool at old age...cannot be cured
4311 2018-07-24 15:44:03 You're missing baby oil!

4321 2018-07-24 15:42:57 Seriously now. Who’s going to put Russia (they have an army don’t forget) out of the oil business?
4322 2018-07-24 15:42:55 Because the US dollar is being artificially elevated in value due to the oil standard. All oil is purchased in dollars. Which is why we went to war with Iraq. They stopped buying oil with dollars. 
4323 2018-07-24 15:42:44 Most deniers see climatologist's as snake oil salesmen for  their obsession with inefficient, over priced green energy industries, carbon credit scams, and absurd claim that climate change is man made.

4487 2018-07-24 15:29:44 You are right. How about human rights in Cuba (which is only70 miles of the coast of Florida), South America, Africa, China...it seems we are concerned about human rights
Only in countries that have oil, correct???

4500 2018-07-24 15:28:25 A cut is a cut; & you both missed my point, which wasn't to argue about no transparency or verifiable data in oil industry worldwide (especially OPEC/Russia). I was critiquing the media/IEA/industry's "supply crunch looms, who could've guessed?" & producers need more $ narrative.
4501 2018-07-24 15:28:19 Investigate these oil deals.
4502 2018-07-24 15:28:18 That’s how you justify oil tankers, oil spills and oil fires? Gambling with the odds of a spill? For the unnecessary purpose of selling oil to Asia?

Ridiculous!

You won’t convince anyone on oil tankers with that lame excuse.

4521 2018-07-24 15:26:27 Didn’t want to be right on this but I called it yesterday! Iran blocks the strait. The hill article you linked to says they’ll do EXACTLY that. Russia sells oil at the new high prices to China japan Korea. It’s an emergency so GOP lifts sanctions and WE buy from them too.
4522 2018-07-24 15:26:15 I don’t give a damn about inequality or other problems in US. That’s your problem, go fix it.

Retardo, I am telling u that if the West stops feeding the Ayatollahs by the oil revenue, Iranians will crush the regime in no time. They’re plundering our wealth! #IslamicRegimeMustGo
4523 2018-07-24 15:26:01 Claim: Coconut oil improves fat burning. 

Truth: There is no scientific evidence for that. 

If you want to lose fat, concentrate on ADHERING to a modest enegery deficit eating the foods you enjoy. 

Don't get caught up in another "must have", fashionable diet.

4600 2018-07-24 15:18:11 Trump bombed Syria and deported  Russian diplomats out of the US.  He increased sanctions on Putin and criticized Germany for buying their oil from Russia. So why don’t you ask Crooked Hillary why she sold 20% of our Uranium to Russia?

4611 2018-07-24 15:16:51 19.5%. Its why he says Russia & Trump coming together can help the USA. He & Putin drill oil together and sell it to the American people at pennies off the gallons they are paying now. Trump becomes the billionaire he's always claimed to be.
4612 2018-07-24 15:16:45 Just shows what kind of true friend Trump really is. Killing Russians with Cruise missiles, threatening Russian allies, implementing strangling sanctions, threatening to stop Germany from buying oil from Russia. Wish we had a president who would be more loyal!

essential oil selling propagates anti-intellectualism and rejection of science, especially towards medicine. She hasn't pushed it on it, but it still harbors it.

You can buy stocks to sell them to greater fools by holding them in infinity until greater fools appear.

You can't do that with Crude Oil. It degrades chemically between 1 to 3 years. You have to sell it to refiners within that period, greater fools or not.

4757 2018-07-24 15:03:06 You do NOT protect Alaska’s lands. You sold out on ANWR to big oil business. You care about money only. Not land, not people, not animals, not the environment. Just money, your job, and YOU.
4758 2018-07-24 15:03:05 Pity there is no Ethics Investigation as to which GOP officials and/or Campaign Contributors have received, among other things, equity stakes in the Oil & Gas projects on "newly opened public lands."

Our Lord allows our enemies to see the fullness of the gifts he bestows upon us and then protects us from their attempts to obtain them.

4764 2018-07-24 15:02:22 U.S. efforts to reduce Iran’s oil exports are expected to contribute to global oil price volatility in the short term, according to International Energy Agency’s Keisuke Sadamori,

4772 2018-07-24 15:01:42 Warren is probably one of those dimwits who decry oil company “greed” when the price climbs, as if they aren’t trying to get every penny they can whether it’s $20 a barrel or $80.
4773 2018-07-24 15:01:41 I have so many awful insect bites (15 so far) that I've started using Votarol Gel on them as a pain killer, seems to be working so far. It's a little more effective than lavender oil, but I don't smell quite so nice!

Iran replaces Saudi Arabia in #Oil supply to #India
#Iran was the second-biggest oil supplier to Indian state refiners between April and June, India’s Oil Minister said on Monday, replacing Saudi Arabia as companies took advantage of steeper discounts offered by Tehran.

The oil grime is the big cheat step. Apply it straight form the tube to the model neat, spread it out a bit (a little goes a long way)  and then wipe as much off as you can with a cotton rag (old t-shirt is good for this)

4791 2018-07-24 14:59:59 Well, they need to condemn all palm oil production anyway. Whatever crop, industrial farming- be it organic, is unsustainable. THERE IS NO SUCH thing as deforestation-free palm-oil.
4792 2018-07-24 14:59:56 I think they really do believe this. Can't figure out how they can't see the same sad, ego-maniacal snake oil conman (and not a very good one) thats so painfully obvious to the rest of us. Have there been any credible studies comparing a possible cult foundation in all this?

4897 2018-07-24 14:50:41 Black Seed is rich in antioxidants and people use it to treat skin disease like eczema, rashes, blisters, pimples etc... It fights viruses too... oregano oil cures or helps cure infections.

4902 2018-07-24 14:50:31 Why do we need oil & gas when the future is Solar Power & Eletric cars?
4903 2018-07-24 14:50:29 Nah, it’s an oil that has a roll on application. You rub it on your temples, forehead, neck, behind your ear and sometimes (when I have a MAJOR migraine) I rub it directly under my nose

4912 2018-07-24 14:49:30 Aleksai is right. The reason why people are calling it failed now though is that the Venezuelan government got its money for a variety of programs almost exclusively from oil. When oil prices dropped a few years ago, all the money the government assumed it would have was gone.

4929 2018-07-24 14:47:55 India imports 4,57,000 barrels per day (bpd) oil from Iran.

Total oil import during Apr-Jun quarter:
Iraq - 72,70,000 tonnes.
Iran - 56,70,000 tonnes.
Saudi Arabia - 52,20,000 tonnes.

How will post August 6th US sanctions on Iran affect needs to be seen. 
How will Modi balance?

4960 2018-07-24 14:45:46 if all that matters to you is this tax cut, then that's your call. BTW - the cost of gas is going up (his oil & renewable energy policy) the cost of goods everywhere is going up (tariffs) real wages in america are going down....so that $400/mo is pretty much gone.
4961 2018-07-24 14:45:36 Can somebody interpret my dream. This one significant thing happened . I was sucking on my own nipples. And my shit looked like it was rubbed down in oil maybe. And my titties tasted good... almost sweet. What does that mean. #dreams #dreaminterpreter
4962 2018-07-24 14:45:34 What happens to the ground after you drill oil? What happens to those cavities created by excess drilling? I see no believable answers from Science. What I see are shaky "wellll, not necessarily" answers.
4963 2018-07-24 14:45:22 Does anyone believe for one minute that if Elizabeth May was the sole owner of the oil sands she wouldn’t sell that oil. When will these opponents realize as Canadians we are all owners of the wealth the oil sands can provide. Majority are in favor.

4973 2018-07-24 14:44:38 The most relevant issue here is that the identity of a main Tesla critic is a person that works in the Oil industry, showing an obvious interest to delay the electric car revolution. I mean, the Oil industry can be kick out completely from the car industry.

Iran has the gas Taps for oil on the global market, which pisses Putin off.
Do you really eant to be Putin's collateral damage?
4978 2018-07-24 14:43:52 No thanks. I prefer to keep those pictures in the hands of the people rather than special interests and big oil. Save our lands by keeping the moderate vote blue... once we have a trustworthy alternative we can discuss.

4999 2018-07-24 14:41:58 For the inflation rate Because America's Economy is booming, higher exchage rate, Gas has higher price in world market. we can say huge spike in oil now because of that. lets not blame TRAIN law. there was no incise tax on daily commodities. just the timing of America's -
5000 2018-07-24 14:41:44 What we buy back is refined oil and oil based products at exorbitant prices from the States, whom we sold the crude/bitumen to cheap. Show me in the laws where it says we can't sell raw materials? Because we 100% are selling raw oil to the USA.
5001 2018-07-24 14:41:40 Last time I checked those are not US colonies, so I don’t know what you mean by big boss is happy. South Korea and Kuwait are among the richest nations on earth. Has the US wanted middle eastern oil they would have kept Kuwait as a colony which produces 10% of the worlds oil.

5005 2018-07-24 14:40:40 Agreed that oil is a loser. Only thing it’s still a necessity. Not as a fuel source because there many alternatives but in the manufacturing of plastics and other products economically. Cap and trade in Ontario was generating funds to put into technology and energy efficiency.
5006 2018-07-24 14:40:39 As a native Houstonian, this doesn’t surprise me. It’s really cause of the oil/energy companies. All the HQs are there. Helps bring down the overall average, because the salaries are higher top to bottom for the industry.

5047 2018-07-24 14:35:21 You never cared about our military women and men. It’s about the oil, the wealth, the stripping of natural resources around the world. VFW’s deserve the truth, as we all do. VFW’s need to stand together with us.  Before more women and men give their lives.

5050 2018-07-24 14:35:11 The money the Putin makes off of the oil will go for missiles that he will pointed directly at the United States. The balance of the money will go for buying of Congress. It seems like they can be bought pretty cheap...

The company is a critical part of the nation’s oil business, due to its huge refining capacity specialized in extra-heavy crude, used to process almost 800 thousand barrels a day for the United States, Venezuela’s most important partner.

5084 2018-07-24 14:32:14 @whyyradiotimes dont forget if Iranian oil production drops or sales are blocked, then world oil prices rise, we pay more and Putin’s economy grows stronger as his oil sales boom. Always comes back to what Is good for Putin.

5102 2018-07-24 14:30:19 Given the profound impact higher fuel prices have on family budgets and our economy, we need to take aggressive action on all fronts to lower gas prices. Today, dependence on oil is a threat to U.S. national security, economic growth, & our planet.
5103 2018-07-24 14:30:16 Like peanutbutter that has palm oil added while the natural peanut oil is separated out because more money can be made by selling peanut oil separately.

5117 2018-07-24 14:28:51 I have to wonder if this latest episode with Iran is an effort to raise oil and gas prices to make U.S. oil industry happy.
5118 2018-07-24 14:28:41 Criticizing the efforts of the US & @NATO to stop Milosevic shows either profound ignorance or profound bias.

The Balkan war stopped a genocide.

The US gained nothing from it. No oil. No land. Nothing.

One can argue the merits and motives of Middle East involvement. Not here.

5123 2018-07-24 14:28:23 You have a misconception that I don’t look for ways to make our energy consumption more sustainable with alternative energy.

Whether you like it or not, the fact is global demand for oil will keep increasing year over year until 2040. I will be there to meet that demand

5149 2018-07-24 14:25:24 The difference is that there is nothing to stop printing up more paper.  So long as the issuer guarantees to exchange for something objective, that's not true.  Imagine a currency denominated in kWH or KJ., making oil prices quite stable.
5150 2018-07-24 14:25:21 Kleveru oil tuh fungsinya buat apa yah

5154 2018-07-24 14:24:55 Nice try, but you can't make crap up out of thin air...
Let's look at the water in Flint, MI,
during the Obama years, under a Democrat Government in MI...
Bet you'll spin that on Trump too? 
We can be energy independent, not slaves to the rest of the world, if we use our own oil.
5155 2018-07-24 14:24:54 It is very disappointing, in light of the UK’s obligations under the #ParisAgreement and the huge need to address #ClimateChange, to see national policy support for oil and gas #missedopportunity At least #fracking didn’t get a specific shoutout
5156 2018-07-24 14:24:52 1) How to change the oil in your car.

2) Entrepreneurship. What it really means to walk down that road alone, sacrifices you’ll make, think big, and that it’s OK to fail. 

3) How to be your own person and live YOUR life.

5159 2018-07-24 14:24:35 I hope Trump stopped all exports of American oil until gas goes down to ten cents a gallon.
5160 2018-07-24 14:24:27 The funny thing is that Big Oil is really Little Oil: big producers account for single digits market share apiece. Pretty hard to run a conspiracy while selling a global commodity.
5161 2018-07-24 14:24:25 The argument in these threads are not pro oil or anti EV, they are simply short a poorly run company in $TSLA in a public market. Most here are quite happy to welcome the soon to arrive EV competition

5179 2018-07-24 14:22:42 Oil flows lot better than any water based I’ve tried if customer buys water based and there’s a lot of woodwork eg A hsl Job I ask them if it’s ok I use oil instead very rare customer says they prefer water based
5180 2018-07-24 14:22:28 Nxa. He's not even taking real money! This is my constant frustration with corrupt African's - its bad enough they are selling out but they also selling out short!!! Like if you're going to sell out on an oil deal can you collect more than peanuts at least!!!
5181 2018-07-24 14:22:27 I replaced my scented lamp oil with vodka. Mea Culpa.
5182 2018-07-24 14:22:26 Done with my #oil #cl_f trades. Time for tweeter. This is funny. Lol

5186 2018-07-24 14:21:35 One thing that doesn't get brought up....always felt there was a tinge of racism in the 'oil money' jibe.  Not from everyone....but with some can't help but feel that it is at least partly owing to that.
5187 2018-07-24 14:21:34 Showed up to get an oil change at 7am. Told me the wait is an hour and half. How? I’m 3rd in line!?
5188 2018-07-24 14:21:28 Goan see what Norway is doing with their oil too bro
5189 2018-07-24 14:21:28 Oh no, not the oil companies. We need them to keep making billions while destroying our environment!
5190 2018-07-24 14:21:23 Yeah The Same Thing Happens To Me with Those I Ended Up Loving Black Castor Oil And Flaxseed One It Has A Black Top & Looks Like It Has Sparkles In It

5194 2018-07-24 14:20:49 Venezuela nationalized its oil, that's why the corporate media has dimmed your brain about that country.
5195 2018-07-24 14:20:45 I bought a cartridge of oil once and all it did was taste disgusting. Also Bon Appetit magazine had a page dedicated to CBD products this summer, which is definitely how you know it’s gone too far.

5198 2018-07-24 14:20:09 Just as sickening r the imposters in government selling their putrid snake oil in the form emotions to help the poor.
5199 2018-07-24 14:20:06 We no longer need NATO in my opinion as Western Europe for the most part are not allies and not yet enemies, but classified as adversaries.  If Germany wants oil from Russia, then let Russia protect them...Now Eastern Europe is a different story and we should support them.

5202 2018-07-24 14:19:49 I wish - only if the stains were not of oil & grease :(

And thank you for understanding. Hope steps are taken to prevent further occurrences.
5203 2018-07-24 14:19:44 My hand cream of choice is Frog Oil- Antibacterial liniment made for horses' hooves, it keeps them moisturised and smooth (for lacework) whilst also not softening or peeling my calluses (which I need for weightlifting). I use the oil-and-salt for the rest of my skin though :D

5205 2018-07-24 14:19:39 I've tried so many oil free CC products but I still get that oily shine just a few hours later  I'd love to try this to see if it is finally the answer to that frustrating problem. And SPF40 is an added bonus!
5206 2018-07-24 14:19:33 And BTW, when are you going to release your taxes so we can see how much YOU benefit from all this. Do you have investments in weapons? Overseas investments? Middle East oil? Russian oil? Does Deutsche Bank own most of you?? Does Bank of Cyprus own most of you? Release your taxes
5207 2018-07-24 14:19:31 I remember the TV show Rescue 911 doing an episode about that crash. Still gives me chills to see it. I'm amazed that paramedic lived. Did the car behind your dad lose his brakes or hit oil that caused him to tap the back of your dad's car?
5208 2018-07-24 14:19:28 There is no "big oil" anymore. There's only big energy. Energy companies are just as happy to invest in batteries and ways to charge them.
5209 2018-07-24 14:19:27 only hear,right?but did u know that if employers are treating them right there is no reason for the employee to runaway? I hope u do research, Some of us they spill boiling oil,throw cups with hot liquid on it,getting scolded,getting raped.we came to work 4 our family not to die.

5218 2018-07-24 14:18:03 Whether China will use natural gas as a stopgap during the transition from carbon-intensive fuels to renewables is important. Why? China, as they have with oil in the past, possesses the electricity demand to drive global natural gas prices, explains Ed Chow @CSISEnergy #CSISlive

5227 2018-07-24 14:17:04 You’re very ill-informed. No one is taking their oil. In fact, no one is buying it anymore. The Iranian people are protesting. They have help from our allies. Stop being manipulated by the left media.

5232 2018-07-24 14:16:34 These studies contradict with Japanese medical studies which not only suggested but confirmed that EPA do lower LDL and memory. However, badly processed and oxidized fish oil are the no good at all.
5233 2018-07-24 14:16:23 Mother knows best while the dad as projected a lulu idiot smiles to camera in today's TVCs. From choosing the right soap, refined oil it's always a lady making obvious decisions against a husband standing with kids and smiling.
5234 2018-07-24 14:16:20 Do you know about the olive oil/sugar or salt scrub? I use it whenever I spin fine wool or silk - enough of both in your palm to make a paste, rub all over your hands, rinse off in hot water. Result - silky smooth hands. (Remove rings first) (Works with soap for gardeners' hands)

5237 2018-07-24 14:15:41 what have we all done to deserve efficascent oil? i would be lost without it.
5238 2018-07-24 14:15:26 Yeah, was focusing on oil. I think Rosneft does, but would want to know how Qatar would feel about it/what risks Rosneft is willing to take there given risks elsewhere. I think gas projects are much likelier to come to fruition.
5239 2018-07-24 14:15:24 I'm sure the oil companies look forward to selling natural gas to utilities that will supply power used in BEVs.

5244 2018-07-24 14:15:11 What is precluding you from buying oil stocks?
5245 2018-07-24 14:15:09 Never mind the huge volume of synthetic oil needed to lubricate their moving parts during their short lifespan.  Very wasteful.

5267 2018-07-24 14:12:31 Add a tablespoon of cooking oil to your washing machine and run again with the bag.
5268 2018-07-24 14:12:10 You are a millionaire and well insulated. It's the factory workers for example who will be shafted by the charlatans and snake oil salesmen.

5277 2018-07-24 14:11:33 Cantwell: "The more we pump, the harder they work to make sure oil prices stay high.  It is clear that we cannot drill our way out of this problem."
5278 2018-07-24 14:11:26 So many things idiotic about that statement. But even if you buy into the macho bullshit: does he really think playing f*cking football requires more “toughness” than, say,  being a roofer? Or a cancer doc? Or a sanitation worker? An oil rig worker? Raising kids?
5279 2018-07-24 14:11:20 Putin’s Apprentice needs to go...  what happened to the republicans that let this snake oil salesman hijack the party?
5280 2018-07-24 14:11:09 Cantwell: "The reality is that even as crude oil prices have nearly doubled over the last two years, oil supplies have been relatively flat, despite the record U.S. crude oil production."
5281 2018-07-24 14:11:08 Why are you talking about austerity?
Westminster has taken 92% of scots oil revenues for 40 years and still managed to near bankrupt the UK.
Scotland is a very resource rich country,thats why WM wont let scots go

5286 2018-07-24 14:10:45 Cantwell: "I’d also like to learn more about why record-level oil production here in the U.S. is not providing any relief at the pump. Just last week we reached a new production record of 11 million barrels per day. Only slightly behind Russia at 11.4 million barrels per day."
5287 2018-07-24 14:10:39 Zionist Israel's possession of nuclear weapons is a danger to the world. If it ever gets into a war it's losing, Zionist Israel will not hesitate to use nuclear bombs. This will interrupt the flow of oil to the entire world thus paralyzing mainly Europe & the US. US wake up!

5295 2018-07-24 14:09:49 Meat pollutes the body and the world.  #vegan  plant based diets reverse heart disease and most chronic health conditions.  Meat, dairy, oil, needs to go away for the future of the plant and our health care!

5297 2018-07-24 14:09:39 Coating on wires is made with peanut oil. SMH seems like they could use something else. Old,used motor oil would be a good option. If I were in charge of the world......
5298 2018-07-24 14:09:35 Once i tried a cocktail a friend was habing and it tasted like what i would expect motor oil to taste like so i still don't understand why people enjoy the taste of alcohol (but i have the bitter gene so that's a big hindrance)

5310 2018-07-24 14:08:29 Let me state for the record that I WISH I'd either worked for the oil industry or owned oil stocks as those guys pay GREAT, but sadly I've done neither. I have, however, pumped my own gas in multiple 400-mi, 5-minute fill-ups while Teslemmmings waited an hour for 250 miles

5316 2018-07-24 14:08:00 it surprises me how long fragrance oil sticks to skin/nails.

Like, when you put it in soap and then wash with it.. the fragrance dissipates off your skin pretty fast, like within minutes.

But straight oil that you accidentally get on your skin? Sticks for daaaaays.

5371 2018-07-24 14:03:45 I doubt that. Lots of oil wells were closed because they were unprofitable at $50. You'd run into the 100% mark long before hitting $100 much less $200.
5372 2018-07-24 14:03:35 is there some bizarre implication/accusation that oil interests are afraid of them (and thusly, can't be cogent) because they'd go out of business from 1 car company?

5380 2018-07-24 14:02:33 I share your opinion on palm oil. It is distructive as hell. Akin to growing almonds in the desert. And both are often marketed as a green alternative. You may have noticed I take issue with marketing quite often

5449 2018-07-24 13:56:28 Body oil got me feeling so soft.. I’ll never use lotion again
5450 2018-07-24 13:56:24 I’ve heard that Montana Skeptic works in the oil industry and was violating his employment agreement. Is this true @QTRResearch ? Does Montana represent oil interests? $tsla #tesla unmasking the trolls.
5451 2018-07-24 13:56:15 So 2 in 3 people STILL want that snake oil they ordered in 2016. Incredulous. #BrexitReality
5452 2018-07-24 13:56:07 But then for Venezuela you might be right! Just to steal your oil not to bring you freedom!
5453 2018-07-24 13:55:52 2.25 hours in this VW dealership smfh I had the 1st service appt of the day for a reason.  Oil change and routine makntenance wtf hurry this shit up my time is valuable

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
5457 2018-07-24 13:55:29 TIL about @npr_watch which I’m now following. Relieved, in a way, to learn there are others who wonder how long @NPR can get away with the smoothed-out, happy/perky/office-coffee-banter act to cover the news to keep their oil & gas & chemical & other corporate underwriters happy.
5458 2018-07-24 13:55:23 Many in BJP has realized that (not realise), they will not able to to hold the erection (not election) until 2019. So they better try on 2024 with some kind of herbal oil by any of their pet Baba or by some ground breaking research at Jio institute.

5461 2018-07-24 13:55:13 Who are you selling this snake oil to? Your poorly educated base?

5463 2018-07-24 13:54:58 Just told my mother I need a small loan of half a million dollars and then “I’d be cookin with peanut oil” why tf am I still using that reference, someone please stop me.
5464 2018-07-24 13:54:49 Ok, but I need to know what’s IN these blends! I’ve turned into an essential oil fanatic, but I’m still learning.
5465 2018-07-24 13:54:47 2/2 and the OP is about environmentalists/ land defenders being MURDERED to keep access to cheap palm oil. Your customers at the end of the ag pipeline don't want your expensive canola oil... they want murder-subsidized palm oil.
5466 2018-07-24 13:54:42 Original components ended due to the reduction of citizen participation in “common defense” . Free is others-funded especially if “education” as a general term is is defined. A person “educated” in truck driving can make $100k in the oil fields now... supply and demand.

5471 2018-07-24 13:54:16 Trump's dangerous, He hired a Baffoon to run EPA so he/his oil buddies can destroy it. He's guts everything Americans have worked so hard to get. What happened to letting states decide? Trump makes up the rules as he goes along. He's a pig in every sense of the word. Sorry pigs!
5472 2018-07-24 13:54:03 Trader said: "The US is now close to becoming the world’s largest crude oil producer which will be problematic as production issues get resolved globally as our long-term fundamental view remains bearish with technology moving ahead at breakneck speed."

5475 2018-07-24 13:53:42 Palm oil largely used for "margarine, confectionery, chocolate, ice cream and bakery products" and beauty products. CONSUMERIST CRAP. MOST of which we DON'T need, folks. This issue is addressed by getting a hold on consumerist lifestyles and addiction to cheap shit. 1/2

5481 2018-07-24 13:52:48 When the Sahni book was new to me i wanted to make vindaloo. The recipe calls for mustard oil. At the Charlottesville equivalent of world harvest, they sold mustard oil, but the bottle said “warning not for human consumption”. Still alive.

5488 2018-07-24 13:52:15 There’s no “Discovery Channel Whale Week” because it would decimate the lamp oil industry, thus sending the whole world economy into a downward spiral
5489 2018-07-24 13:52:13 The old B230F engine was next to bulletproof. Keep the oil changed and the sludge filter cleaned out and they keep going and going until a piston screams, "Screw this", and tries to escape the car.

5495 2018-07-24 13:51:20 Hopefully you will be using local people to build your new houses announced today in Aberdeen. Would be very helpful cause Aberdeen is still suffering a bit from the oil turn down.
5496 2018-07-24 13:51:17 Big question is at what oil price do you set your project economics? $45/bbl? $55... $65?
5497 2018-07-24 13:51:17 Nice catch up with the old buddy @Michae1Evans hope the oil cherries help sir!!!!
5498 2018-07-24 13:51:13 I literally pray over me ,my babiessss & use oil to anoint us because our life anit promised
5499 2018-07-24 13:51:10 No problem! And yeah let me know! If you do the oil just be sure to dilute it very well!!
5500 2018-07-24 13:51:07 Is this meant to justify your support of palm oil?
5501 2018-07-24 13:50:58 I'm not a SJW but I'm Venezuelan, and to name a few problems (because this is honestly a huge Trainwreck), we have an annual inflation of about 43000% as it stands. Salaries are about 2$ a month, and the only thing we export is oil, no other means of production.
5502 2018-07-24 13:50:32 Because unlike you I look at facts! Under Zuma the price of oil was trading above $150/barrel yet he never allowed Petrol prices to n manipulated yet Silili is allowing this  o happen with his white friends yet u call me dumb lmfao idiot
5503 2018-07-24 13:50:27 i badly need 36 pieces of oil pastels
5504 2018-07-24 13:50:26 ~A third of the world's oil tanker traffic passes through the Strait of Hormuz, bordered by Iran and Oman. In 2016, 18.5 million barrels of petroleum were shipped through it every day, making it the world's single most important maritime route for many nations' #oil

5510 2018-07-24 13:49:48 Ah I get it! Threaten Iran, watch oil stocks go up. Make rich people even richer. Nice one.
5511 2018-07-24 13:49:47 No. It’s better if you include Canada, but no, we aren’t. Besides, oil prices would still climb as oil is a global market.
5512 2018-07-24 13:49:41 เลี้ยงไอติมหน่อย
5513 2018-07-24 13:49:35 "vegetable oil demand".... demand for what uses? And what is the emergy metrics on such uses? Emergy is the embedded energy in a given product, FYI... and in almost all cases, fuel uses of vegetable oils have poor emergy conversion rates. Veg oils used in industry, a good thing.

5588 2018-07-24 13:42:30 Uuu wait dip your toast in some mixed olive oil and honey 

It’s good
5589 2018-07-24 13:42:23 At work. Have to wait on vehicle to get an oil change. Someone entertain me.
5590 2018-07-24 13:42:15 As we concentrate on Trump/Russia, how much damage is Trump doing to the environment? Now he's considering oil exploration in arctic. Trump may come to an end, but the damage he creates may be irreversible.
5591 2018-07-24 13:42:06 AYYYY HAHAHAHAHAHA! SANA OIL HAHAHAHA!
5592 2018-07-24 13:42:06 hahsdsfjhds my friend's asking me for tips on painting with oil bUT I HAVENT USED OIL IN NEARLY 2 YEARS I GAGGED
5593 2018-07-24 13:41:51 You mean there's no oil there?
5594 2018-07-24 13:41:50 BIG FACTS. And any wet foods or foods that have sauce should be put on a pot or pan with a lil water or vegetable oil. Take like 5-10 minuets longer but the results are superior.
5595 2018-07-24 13:41:45 This sounds like the Trumps family and the Republicans in Congress what they do in the USA. Shame on Pompeo, u failed with North Korea now ur trying to stick it to Iran. I guess you want there oil so u can control the flow and the Petro dollars
5596 2018-07-24 13:41:40 Why does olive oil spray exist?

It’s wrong I think
5597 2018-07-24 13:41:37 I just love the notion that oil is unclean and therefore Montana is worthy of silencing. Can always count on the left for fascistic behavior. The entire sordid episode makes me nauseous. $TSLA
5598 2018-07-24 13:41:30 You never gave me a free oil change
5599 2018-07-24 13:41:25 そりゃ東郷に慣れたらみんな火力無いよ
5600 2018-07-24 13:41:12 Knowing how easily flimflam artists & snake oil salesmen fooled gullible masses 2 believe in god & thus turn over all their cash 1 can understand Y so many believed dt's lies & voted 4 him. But after all he's done 2 hurt American human beings how can this creature still have fans
5601 2018-07-24 13:41:07 Actual conversation I had with my friend:

Friend: Are you olive oil?
Me: Why?
Friend: Cuz you're extra virgin
5602 2018-07-24 13:40:54 Did you know an oil change for a Bugati Veyron is $21,000  IF you had the money would you buy one? #MackAndManny
5603 2018-07-24 13:40:51 Each black dot represents the flow of oil and the "true" cost of how much we pay at the pump through taxes and the National Debt.  Yet, politicians are still fighting to keep using fossil fuels when there are so many other forms of energy to develop.

5610 2018-07-24 13:40:05 いやーっ(´༎ຶོρ༎ຶོ`)
学名のところをよく見たら、学名じゃなくてessential oilって書いてあります〜っ(ಠ_ಠ)

これは、アレがアレしてるかもしれませんね(>_<)
5611 2018-07-24 13:39:58 .. มันยากขนาดนั้นเลยเหรอ
5612 2018-07-24 13:39:54 If Trump wants lower oil prices he shouldn't talk down the $USD, and threaten Iran.
5613 2018-07-24 13:39:43 @DuvalHondaFL I just had the WORST experience at DH.I bought my car new the Honda at the Avenues in 2016.  Bought a service contract at the time for oil changes.  DH charged me $35 above the service contract to change the oil and wanted $75 for a cabin air filter, a $10-20 item.
5614 2018-07-24 13:39:37 Jodi is stretching that pretty hard. Vegetable oil demand could easily be met with modern production tech but the green movement has blinders on
5615 2018-07-24 13:39:15 -SUGAR
Sugar helps exfoliate your skin.Mix a tablespoon of raw sugar with some almond oil and a few drops of lemon juice. Mix it well and apply it on the area of the stretch marks.
5616 2018-07-24 13:39:13 Product limit is in all products like sugar, oil and even in toothpaste. You guys have to come up with some solution or else you will lose geniune customers
5617 2018-07-24 13:39:03 -CASTOR OIL
castor oil also gets rid of wrinkles, age spots, moles, dark spots, fine lines and pimples.Apply some castor oil to the area and massage the area in circular motions for 5 to 10 minutes.
5618 2018-07-24 13:39:03 the Electoral Collage was because there was such a lag time for news. Now communication has the lag time of the Callers delay if they listen with the TV volume up...It's out dated as Sperm Whale Oil for lighting you're House
5619 2018-07-24 13:39:01 When wasps invade my apartment I mix up mint oil, water and a little dish soap - they hate the smell of mint! Good luck!
5620 2018-07-24 13:38:54 So you would rather have Syria but in a country with massive oil reserves and a narrow land bridge between Saudi and Iran populated by Shias?
5621 2018-07-24 13:38:38 ran out of butter so I sprayed my toast with olive oil spray is that wrong
5622 2018-07-24 13:38:35 I’ve used the red chile oil...it’s delicious.
5623 2018-07-24 13:38:21 207 environmental activists were murdered in 2017 as government-sponsored killings linked to lucrative projects by vast agriculture multinationals soared. Activists were killed trying to protect land from development, for production of consumer staples such as coffee & palm oil
5624 2018-07-24 13:38:19 But at the same time, it doesn’t hurt to call@around and ask. I’ll tell ya what though, I’d give my dog CBD oil before I would give her those doggy xanax pills.

5628 2018-07-24 13:37:57 @JOSH_GORDONXII CBD oil is the best treatment for anxiety. You won’t test positive either because the amounts are minuscule. Zero addictive property’s. Please talk to a professional about CBD for anxiety
5629 2018-07-24 13:37:51 からかさ使ったけど火力足りねぇんだよなぁ
5630 2018-07-24 13:37:50 my face is so OILY n i only use oil free foundations this is so sad
5631 2018-07-24 13:37:49 I say again to you take the truth serum quit being a dishonest politician quit being a snake oil salesman
5632 2018-07-24 13:37:48 I’d rather go to the dentist than wait at the dealership for an oil change
5633 2018-07-24 13:37:31 You must only smoke and not ingest as with an infusion or oil.
5634 2018-07-24 13:37:30 You know, I’ve told my wife a hundred times I like Oil and Vinegar, but just a little Red Wine Vinegar and just lightly dressed. I swear to God, if she doesn’t get it right next time she’ll find herself locked in the bathroom calling 911
5635 2018-07-24 13:37:21 And from Michelle Gochanour per FB comments: 

"And Erik Prince's friend is Congressmen Bill Huizenga who helped to pass a bill that makes it easier for oil and gas companies to bribe foreign governments...which Trump signed."
5636 2018-07-24 13:37:15 It’s CBD oil. If I was an over the counter drug then I could understand. But we’re talking about the most natural oil in the world. Ever seen a dog eat an ounce of weed? I have. The dog ate a whole bag of food and slept for a whole day. Dog was completely fine though
5637 2018-07-24 13:37:12 In addition, in the time since, Venezuela has become the strawman for American conservatived to point to as evidence of failed socialism, despite our continued sanctions for reasons we later admitted were false (in the article I linked). Most of this is over oil in the region.
5638 2018-07-24 13:37:10 David Graeber tells the example of oil execs asking gvt for regs. They say the system(competitive enterprise) they are in will not allow then to control their actions- only gvt can.
5639 2018-07-24 13:37:07 OIL 1H very volatile right now. NOT on Morning Briefing was 61.62 intraday support from overnight, just now wick tags & moves aggressively back above 20MA again. This satisfies a CORRECTIVE move and confirms LOD. Sets up bullish again. UWT.
5640 2018-07-24 13:37:02 Just reply my query what was the price of petrol during Congress rule when crude oil price was 100USD and what is the price of petrol when crude oil price was 60USD under bjp. And we're is the money going?
5641 2018-07-24 13:36:45 then why you comparing CR/Zuma about oil/petrol price if you understand oil markets?
5642 2018-07-24 13:36:40 俺の価値観が色々ぶち壊れる出来事がこの後あってその前後にある本もあるのだけれど、それはまた別のお話
5643 2018-07-24 13:36:38 That fire was Vinnie. He didn't use enough olive oil when he was banging Maria, and his dick got so hot it set the sheets on fire. True story.

5645 2018-07-24 13:36:07 What is that liquid ?? Oil ?
5646 2018-07-24 13:35:38 Clear value is hard for young ppl to show as their body of work often cannot speak for itself yet. The game may need to be played until your work can stand on its own, but that shld be the goal. Value in work/talent/skill that is clearly evident. Not lip sticking snake oil sales.
5647 2018-07-24 13:35:23 Vitamin E oil... they have two different levels of it, it’s inexpensive and it legit works as long as your consistent
5648 2018-07-24 13:35:19 Saraki, the real Yoruba demon.

They way APC is going down they will soon discover oil.
5649 2018-07-24 13:35:18 suppose every car on the planet is electric, how's that bad for fossil fuel (including oil)? That extra gigantic load of electricity, and even ignoring infrastructure issues, would have to come from an energy source... so unless the source is free (sun/wind), EVs are no threat.
5650 2018-07-24 13:35:13 Agreed.  Some patients have to take 10 mls of oil per day to get relief.  For some that's way too much actual oil for many seniors and children to take.

5652 2018-07-24 13:35:12 Venezuela cannot supply enough calories for its people. Oil and blood.

5654 2018-07-24 13:34:57 @AriFleischer must have a lot of $ in oil investments. Aggression against Iran is a Russian oil and gas con.
5655 2018-07-24 13:34:56 What is face tune? Lol. And yeah snap filters amuse me so why not. Some people though look like oil paintings their airbrush their pics so much. Who has time for that?
5656 2018-07-24 13:34:53 聴きてぇ
5657 2018-07-24 13:34:50 In other words, it is not very feasible to ask the second-largest consuming nation of palm oil to boycott it, huh?

5660 2018-07-24 13:34:33 Then maybe she should eat some REAL ice cream, instead of the crap in that photo, made from vegetable oil and skimmed milk powder with air blown through it.
5661 2018-07-24 13:34:31 First is correct, though I often see it just as a front for the latter case instead. =_= No, it was Chavez's fault, for balancing the entire economy on oil, without any sort of backup. It was also his and his replacement's fault for controlling Venezuela with an iron fist.
5662 2018-07-24 13:34:26 Okay i use water with a couple drops of rosemary and tea tree oil, it help keep my skin clear. Just a couple days out the week and then i put my Shea butter on! Dilute it very well tho because it can dry your skin out, or you can try micellar water works too.
5663 2018-07-24 13:34:09 Thank you God for giving me a brother that changes the oil in my car and takes care of me

5669 2018-07-24 13:33:32 How about we address the rampant commodification and consumerism that leads to palm oil plantations? The endless hucksters selling shit we don't need made in ways we don't need things to be made? The attacks on people attempting to set policies restricting extractivist behaviour?

5677 2018-07-24 13:32:34 2. This recovery narrative was sustained into H1-18, amid favorable stability in global crude oil prices & local production. #NGOutlook18
5678 2018-07-24 13:32:26 Some blame on supermarkets too with cheap  food stuffed full of sugar, salt and palm oil(some drinks have sugar plus artificial sweetner!) . We must teach pupils  how to cook at school so the next generation can pass this lost skill of cooking quality food on to their children.
5679 2018-07-24 13:32:19 Hamilton perfection 1.5inch pure bristle for me best brush for oil without a doubt
5680 2018-07-24 13:32:17 Have to take the car in for an oil change... For most people this isn't a big deal, but for me?The worst part about it is I can't use my meds to help with the anxiety because I have to drive. #cannabis
5681 2018-07-24 13:32:15 I hope they live to see the day when oil becomes insignificant and they go to the bottom of the food chain.
5682 2018-07-24 13:32:14 Nagsorry si manong grab driver sa akin dahil amoy efficacent oil sya. Kakapamasahe lang daw nya kasi.  Nakakarelax kaya yung amoy! Parang gusto ko rin tuloy magpamasahe mamaya.

5684 2018-07-24 13:32:01 1. Nigeria’s balance of trade (BOT) rebounded to a surplus position in 2017 after closing below the water in 2015 and 2016 due to a plunge in oil prices. #NGOutlook18
5685 2018-07-24 13:31:48 70s stagflation was rapid oil price plus no growth - that’s not where we are and not going to be caused by investment

5716 2018-07-24 13:28:58 Why do so many repeat the same meme's like "Peterson is a snake oil salesman"?  It's very robotic, predictable, and makes you look like a fundamentalist that can't think for himself.  I suspect that last sentence is the truth.
5717 2018-07-24 13:28:54 Oil in the ground value is 3$/£2.30 a barrel. So fortunes to made. Come on matd show us the Black Gold

5720 2018-07-24 13:28:23 Apply oils to your lashes. Apply a thin coat of olive oil, caster oil, coconut oil, or vaseline to your lashes before you go to bed at night. Oils and commercial products will measurably increase the volume, length, and curvature of your lashes with regular use.

5725 2018-07-24 13:28:04 Looks like the guts of a pizza roll, definitely something greasy because you can see the oil stain on the outside
5726 2018-07-24 13:27:46 คนฉลาดต้องใช้มือถือเป็นนะ
5727 2018-07-24 13:27:44 Nope but you can ingest the oil. Save yourself those pesky gummy calories 
5728 2018-07-24 13:27:32 アマデウスでどうたらって話があったけど最近だけでもNTLとFGOとシュタゲでアマデウスモチーフが出てるからどこが入り口やったんかは分からんやろ
5729 2018-07-24 13:27:28 Man that Hyderabad gold be some heavy shit.  And the Hashiabad oil, man.

Watch your speed.  
5730 2018-07-24 13:27:26 Many people think that the increase in the price of oil means an increase in the price of gas. This is not the case with heating and cooling systems. The price of natural gas has actually been falling, while heating oil prices have risen.
5731 2018-07-24 13:27:26 With d way APC is going down they will soon discover oil
5732 2018-07-24 13:27:23 Iran 
Sources close to opposition against leadership of @President_Iran @khamenei_ir suggest government of Islamic Republic worse than Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi
Tortures more
Willing to sacrifice the faithful to please foreign buyers of oil, maintain death grip on Iranian people
5733 2018-07-24 13:27:19 You have read me wrong' I agree with that; I am saying the same as you, However,we need an army to defend our own shores. NOT, to invade other countries. Oil and arms sales are at the centre of most of it; the rich people don't care about the poor people who are caught up in it.

5735 2018-07-24 13:27:03 It's all about Oil and Money.
5736 2018-07-24 13:26:59 Yeah the greatest trick the oil companies ever pulled on canada is selling our own oil back to us at retail rates. Well played, evil fucks. 

Anyway gas is still too cheap here ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Breakfast: Frozen fruit, vanilla protein powder, spinach, added flavoring -> blender.
Lunch: Eggs, popcorn
Dinner: 4 oz chicken or beef, peas or broccoli, onion, maybe some flour& water -> pan fried, sparing on oil.

I eat pretty good for a starving man. ;)
5739 2018-07-24 13:26:39 Ran out of organic shampoo so i used my brother's. My hair now is so flat and limp like it was doused with oil or something.

5741 2018-07-24 13:26:34 The 1970s often felt like the end of days with strikes, three day weeks, rampant inflation, IMF bailouts, oil crises and Wilson's shock resignation. The politics just seemed more grown up and less divisive.
5742 2018-07-24 13:26:28 Fortunes to be made if we hit black gold, 90 billion STOIIP across an acreage 3 times the size of Wales, with shale potential in addition, hit oil here and at 480mbl Wildhorse and millionaires will be made #matd
5743 2018-07-24 13:26:19 Nope. A decent olive oil in Indonesia costs about IDR 200,000 last time I looked
5744 2018-07-24 13:26:15 There is a grower near me that is working on their beer. Tt will have far fewer calories because marijuana isn't a calorie rich plant. Hard to make because THC is oil soluble. Chemists I tell ya. It's like breaking bad, but with healthcare, taxable income, and no violence.

5752 2018-07-24 13:25:43 He declared the winner of the election would govern for a long time. He knew the oil revenue would see to that. His party and the unions didn’t believe him. Hence Thatcher. Well done labour.

5754 2018-07-24 13:25:05 Jones is saying Trump wants to ruin Iran economy by reducing its exports of oil to other countries. This punishes other countries and Iran’s citizenries but good for US profits +2weaken Iran (makes Israel happy). It is cruel and imperialistic! Profits over humanity!
5755 2018-07-24 13:25:04 It's always about oil. Or money.
5756 2018-07-24 13:24:34 @realDonaldTrump We are still severely depressed economically in the four corners area. Need relief for gas & oil-coal-power plants. Always a strong republican stronghold. Please help. Monty

5758 2018-07-24 13:24:33 Please correct if not sensible : starts fight w/Iran, makes russia our ally( alienated all others, including NATO) blocks imported oil from Iran, creates shortages, begins buying oil from Russia??

5763 2018-07-24 13:23:58 November 1 is when sanctions on Iran kick in. No nation is allowed to purchase oil from iran. This will collapse the iranian regime. They are currently going through tough times economically. This will be the straw that breaks the camels back. War is coming..
5764 2018-07-24 13:23:50 Oil lol... gold go now plz.

Do you still sample a few pints of neck oil Guinness whist dieting?
5767 2018-07-24 13:23:20 This should now be designated as a national treasure and saved for future generations! That means no more oil companies drilling. Coral Reefs not corporate profits!!!!

5775 2018-07-24 13:22:52 Came in to do an oil change ONLY to get all types of new air filters. Shit man.
5776 2018-07-24 13:22:52 Clearly somethings thinks it’s worth it. Denmark, once 70% oil dependant for energy is well on its way to bing supplied 100% renewable energy by ~ 2035. They are approaching 50%. No wonder they are so happy.
5777 2018-07-24 13:22:42 Hi, Southerner here. A little soap is fine every now and then. What I do is wash it, dry it, wipe it down with a paper towel with a little oil on it, and if the oven is still hot, I pop it back in to “bake”.
5778 2018-07-24 13:22:19 The majority of the people who live where drilling occurs built their homes in a known, active oilfield. Would those same people move to the desert and complain about the lack of rainfall? 

Reasonable initiatives are needed. Oil companies and the community need to work together

5780 2018-07-24 13:22:02 And how’s our contributions going to the region we live in and then you play the China card and claim our small neighbors are being exploited. And then we have the Timor oil and gas treaty debacle clearly ruthless.
5781 2018-07-24 13:21:58 Haha...skim reading and it shows...no wonder the SP didn't move...saying that there is a constant seller not sure why with all the ramping from a DL ....?
5782 2018-07-24 13:21:57 @jimcramer Jim, the USA lost disputes on Timber against Canada at WTO at least 2 maybe 3 times in the past and then Ross puts tariff on lumber os really why should Canada do anything. Maybe the same Ross Theory applies to the 3.5 Million bbls of oil imported daily? Tariff Oil too
5783 2018-07-24 13:21:55 @teacherwright1 I found out that ants don’t like the aroma of cinnamon so I wiped down surfaces with the Doterra Cassia cinnamon essential oil. Like magic, ants are gone and my house smells amazing.
5784 2018-07-24 13:21:45 Which of your cronies are benefitting here? Certainly, not the American people. Prices for goods and services, food will skyrocket. You are killing American trade. Like oil and gas companies raping our environment, someone is benefitting. Putin?

5803 2018-07-24 13:19:09 1. Smokable oils (no unsafe carrier)
2. Higher THC / CBD limits, so a bottle lasts longer
3. Better / realistic dosing guidelines
4. More oil options without stripped terpenes
5. More capsule options

5805 2018-07-24 13:18:49 3. Furthermore, oil prices surprised positively, averaging $71.0/b relative to our projected $55.0-60.0/b for the year. Monetary policy stance was less hawkish, though policy rates were held unchanged throughout the period. #NGOutlook18
5806 2018-07-24 13:18:48 Obama dropped more bombs than w and wrecked Libya and deported more people than W and he let Wall St do what wall St wants and let W's tax cuts stay indefinitely and let oil companies do what they want. He was a pretty good Republican ALPHA president.
5807 2018-07-24 13:18:45 So you made him three for free, right? Were they covered in coke and baby oil.
5808 2018-07-24 13:18:43 You don't have to be a genius to realize he is promoting fossil fuel because oil and gas are absolutely essential to Russia's economy.
5809 2018-07-24 13:18:39 Yup the oil used in most road side place is not vegetable oil but petroleum by product oil
5810 2018-07-24 13:18:36 So we're now buying crude oil from Niger????

I really am not understanding

5812 2018-07-24 13:18:15 Boiled in hot oil would be best.  Oh, and don't kill it first.  I have a feeling that no matter how you cook it, it will still taste foul.  If you need assistance, I am available to watch.

5816 2018-07-24 13:18:07 fair, but given trump's jawboning on opec etc, i think he's genuinely mad that oil prices are going up [and affecting the gop in the midterms]. then again, he's a moron, so...

5821 2018-07-24 13:16:53 Anybody out there has tried black seed oil
5822 2018-07-24 13:16:50 Plus Russia needs the money from higher oil prices, so Putin is pleased.
5823 2018-07-24 13:16:38 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
5824 2018-07-24 13:16:22 @TuckerCarlson Here is a question to ask. If the US is becoming the leading oil producer, should we continue with the oil reserve program?
5825 2018-07-24 13:16:15 No surprising. The jump from "thin privilege" to "beauty is misogyny" is rather small.
5826 2018-07-24 13:15:59 What tax cuts? If you make less that $100,000/yr, your tax cut is a pittance. The even more regressive tariffs are the icing on the tax cuts cake.

Tax cuts reward wealth consolidation and hoarding, at the expense of standards of living and growth. They're economic snake oil.
5827 2018-07-24 13:15:52 Looks like it’s on the march now at long last, an oil strike rns would be just what the doctor ordered easily 40p plus given their 90 billion STOIIP acreage #matd
5828 2018-07-24 13:15:48 Not a problem for other countries who depend on oil revenue. For some reason Russia comes to mind first.

5845 2018-07-24 13:14:04 But before @WEHC2018 there'll be some research @AJHSNYC on Aaron Lopez, eighteenth-century oil baron (whale oil, that is)
5846 2018-07-24 13:14:04 Our last few Rep presidents have certainly had an itch to go to war with Iran, I agree. Oil seems to be one motive, and alliance with the Israeli regime seems to be another. I think there's a third: I think Rep prezzes read Rep voters as *wanting* war. But it seems they're wrong?
5847 2018-07-24 13:13:40 Isn't it plausible then why the locals are asking for oil revenue to be credited directly into their accounts?
5848 2018-07-24 13:13:36 i hope it does.iknow and we know americans have no interest in war in fact all the loss is from their pocket and goes right into the pocket of arm manufacturers and dealers and oil tycoons.well all we can do is pray for a new golf course somewhere :)).

5852 2018-07-24 13:13:13 Restricting domestic production of oil and gas and our ability to export this commodity to our allies abroad is far more damaging to our economy and national security than allowing steel imports. Period.

5874 2018-07-24 13:10:34 Before I went to work for a multinational oil company, I thought that everyone there would be working for maximum return on what the company did. Not true. Personal feuds, etc., were often the order of the day. Stockholders would not have been amused.

5876 2018-07-24 13:10:18 The way they look at it is the less oil Iran sells the more they can raise the price and sell for themselves, shutting down Iran's production of oil by whatever means puts  more money in their pockets.

Soy is pretty much the worst Oil you want to saturate your food in. Based on the effects soy causes with estrogen/testosterone. Vegetable oil is also one of the worst oils available when there are plenty of alternatives available.

6123 2018-07-24 12:42:06 They never cease to amaze. Wonder how much money was wasted on this. The technology to extract oil and gas hasn't even been around long enough to to study this type of affect. Gold mining I think had a similar affect, due to the surrounding business operations though.
6124 2018-07-24 12:42:04 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
6125 2018-07-24 12:42:04 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
6126 2018-07-24 12:42:03 Peanut butter that’s definitely a solid - unless it’s contains palm oil and then that’s a true threat to orangutans not airline safety.
6127 2018-07-24 12:41:56 It is a peninsula projecting into the "Persian Gulf" from the south (Saudi) side. Significant oil production but even more gas. Trying to diversify into tourism.

Tldr : rich Arabs.

6129 2018-07-24 12:41:53 That's nice but... where's my olive oil?
6130 2018-07-24 12:41:40 I reuse more than I generate.  I preserve all of my fruit in recycled glass jars and buy mainly fresh food to cook ...
All food scraps go to my chickens. 
I buy virtually NO food in cardboard boxes, very very few tins (olive oil) and my small garbage bin goes out fortnightly.
6131 2018-07-24 12:41:37 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.

6133 2018-07-24 12:41:25 What was the rate of crude oil price rise during those days?
6134 2018-07-24 12:41:21 In general, Germany seems much more forward thinking that us, they recognised years ago that renewable power had to be invested in, while we were squandering our north sea oil windfall on tax cuts.

6139 2018-07-24 12:41:00 No. They weren't. 

They started falling apart as soon as they started reacquiring private oil production for the state run company. Production PLUMMETED. 

Even today, they'd be fine if the private companies had maintained their control.
6140 2018-07-24 12:41:00 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.

6143 2018-07-24 12:40:53 Dirty Donald Trump’s strategy is a fool’s gambit destined to fail! Iran will simply sell to Russia or China. The oil will immediately and magically be transformed into Russian Oil and sold to Europe without consequence. Why? Because Putin owns Dirty Donald Trump.

It is a powerful cleanser of the energies and enhances intuition, awareness, empathy, and compassion. Focus within. #Sauh.
6167 2018-07-24 12:37:50 We don’t see  Mr. Trump defendíng freedom and democracy, maybe should implies oil or bussiness, not such a thing like humans
6168 2018-07-24 12:37:48 How can palm oil be vegan if it is destroying 1000s of acres of forests + killing all those that inhabit those lands?? Really need to rework the boundaries of the concept. #nopalm

6170 2018-07-24 12:36:55 The truth is that Scotland has massive and highly diverse potential. Oil is a part of that, sure. But Space, Food, Engineering, Renewables, Tourism, Financial Services, Education and many many other sectors are what's going to make the country a global success in the 21st century
6171 2018-07-24 12:36:35 I'm a big olive oil and grapeseed oil fan, too. Need to get some palm oil for my West African recipes.
6172 2018-07-24 12:36:33 Oil prices steadied as rising tension between the United States and Iran highlighted risks to supply while escalating trade disputes raised the prospect of slower economic growth and perhaps weaker energy demand.

6175 2018-07-24 12:36:04 Iran becomes India's No. 2 oil supplier, ahead of Saudi- govt data India, Iran's top oil client after China, shipped in 5.67M tonnes, or about 457K (bpd), of oil, from the country in the first three months of this fiscal year, Dharmendra Pradhan told lawmakers in a written reply.
6176 2018-07-24 12:35:58 Not only would there be a parade or traffic when I'm running late, but in 2018, people are out drilling for oil in every square of land they can get their greedy hands on so we have a 10 minute stop :-)
6177 2018-07-24 12:35:55 Indonesia is the 2nd largest consumer of palm oil and 40% of global production is by smallholders. Impacts of production exist at all levels.
6178 2018-07-24 12:35:46 My hair looks 100x better with oil
6179 2018-07-24 12:35:34 I played around in oil so I can tan cause I’m freaking pale.
6180 2018-07-24 12:35:34 You know youve actually done Canadians a big favour. I know of framers who shut down, car company who shut down because ppl were buying US items. Now a lot can pick up again. And perhaps we can get that oil lines.
6181 2018-07-24 12:35:15 Kindly explain the oil price funda. Last month, when price of crude oil increased in Int mrkt, govt increased it daily by 20-30p/day though increase was slow & steady. But now prices have fallen by 7-8% in Int mrkt, govt reducing prices by 7p-11p.
6182 2018-07-24 12:35:12 Baby oil works?!
6183 2018-07-24 12:35:02 3- Also we are asking US to stop the regime from selling the oil resources of our land and using the revenue to oppress and brutalize the people of Iran, so that Iranians can fight the regime on a level playing field.

6190 2018-07-24 12:34:28 By maintaining a US military presence in Syria and partitioning the country  into spheres of influence similar to China in the 19th century, it  would facilitate Israeli annexation of the Golan and allow US/Israeli  energy companies to exploit the oil reserves.
6191 2018-07-24 12:34:26 Trump forced KSA, who are "the piggy bank [of the US] that's being robbed" to lower the price of oil barrels... then has the shame to talk about tariffs?

6221 2018-07-24 12:30:24 Iran's oil was subject to sanctions under Obama as well. Knowing that by November Iran's oil exports will be reduced, the market has "priced" this in, but overall, yes, lower global supply means higher #gasprices

6227 2018-07-24 12:29:27 Of course it's going to block them, Trump has been told to get that Russian oil off his boss
6228 2018-07-24 12:29:21 That depends on the oil company. One of the largest "suncor" is canadian owned. Others like syncrude have partial ownerships split between investors in Canada, the US, and China.
6229 2018-07-24 12:29:19 Venezuela is the one of the most corrupt countries in the world. Gov. officials involved in oil money embezzlement, the drug and weapons trade. It is a true hell hole for its people. My point was It's not just the socialism that is Venezuelas' problem
6230 2018-07-24 12:28:37 That doesn’t seem very American. Also, it might cause a little global stir...and astronomical oil prices. Oh yeah, it might kill a few million innocent people, making the USA a global terrorist. Bully bombing is not wise.

6350 2018-07-24 12:13:55 U.S. military capabilities may"dwarf" those of Iran,but it should be recalled that Iran has a 523,000 man army, 82 million inhabitants and short, medium and long range missiles.  War might jeopardize oil shipments not only from Iran, but also from Iraq, Emirates and Saudi Arabia.

6402 2018-07-24 12:07:32 I don't know maybe so we won't be dependent on other countries oil and if you think that's a bad thing well then you need to go to whatever country you like Russia ,Venezuela any of those communist socialist countries that you seem to want to live so bad
6403 2018-07-24 12:07:29 You are woefully ignorant, or just plain deceitful. Israel is our only steadfast ally in that regions full of snakes - even during the contempt of the Obama regime. Israel sits atop oil reserves that rival the Saudis.

Educate yourself before excreting your useless opinions.

6405 2018-07-24 12:07:24 Yeah like distracting us that he wants to go to war with Iran but what he really wants is to stop Iran's oil from being distributed so then he can say now we need Russia's help with their oil so that he can put money in Putin in Russia pocket. That's what I think.

6410 2018-07-24 12:07:06 Oil - again -- so good for many things, and so destructive in many, many ways -- war, greed, pollution, climate change
6411 2018-07-24 12:07:06 Why won't it work, or u can't read, the crude oil is not coming from South South Nigeria, the crude is coming from Niger republic, so no bombing of pipeline, why won't it work

I did some research and I found something that helps, Argan Oil. It’s natural. It soothes and actually helps as a mild antiperspirant. 

Indian women have been using it forever. 


6417 2018-07-24 12:06:36 this!!!! is so cute. just needa ask, what kinda oil? 
6418 2018-07-24 12:06:26 That combination of the oil and heat kind of binding the turmeric and cumin in place gives it such a nice look.
6419 2018-07-24 12:06:16 Like turning iron wire into musical steel string. Was there olive oil? (E8 Fromage)
6420 2018-07-24 12:06:15 Also by doing these tariffs you are helping to oil companies and putting people out of jobs in the USA. Solar panels are manufactured in this country. Some part's are not, now it is to expensive to buy solar panels. So there goes the manufacturer and installation jobs.
6421 2018-07-24 12:05:48 The FED is hurting the recovery by raising rates and the FERC has failed to jump in and approve needed pipelines. It is taking 5 years to build that pipeline from West Virginia to the Carolinas.

6431 2018-07-24 12:03:41 Tuesday brings higher markets.  US stock futures are up 0.3% with both Asia and Europe higher.  Oil is $68.26 with gold at $1,228.  A cool breeze on a summer day.
6432 2018-07-24 12:03:29 Well they voted for #Erdogan... so they will just have to live with a weak Lira and higher inflation #turkey the next #Venezuela but without the oil.... just tourism... and that’s not as it used to be too.

6449 2018-07-24 12:00:18 @Scotttaylorva @lisamurkowski  you should really be fighting against the ANWAR drilling. Lets leave something the way we've found it. For future generations... This should be easy!!! Oil is everywhere. Plus we should be getting off oil anyway. Its just common sense.

6480 2018-07-24 11:56:19 In people with a normal diet, taking EPA/DHA (but not ALA) simply causes a mild substrate-inhibition of COX1 and slightly lowers overall eicosanoid production. So, would you rather spend a quarter of a penny on a baby aspirin, or $20 on a bottle of fish oil?

6492 2018-07-24 11:54:30 But betting a country's economic future on such a volatile and declining resource just isn't credible..is it ?

6531 2018-07-24 11:47:18 Zcoin never had an ICO or nothing like that. Is a very respectable project and they already implemented the tech and is working. So not sure how you call that Snake Oil.

6533 2018-07-24 11:47:11 With that I’d have a grass fed palm size steak.. I have an avocado daily, 3 free range eggs, (a mini black Chia, Psyllium husk, Lecithin, blue berries n coconut oil biscuit)All equally consume between BKFST n my 2 lunch school break.. I walk a lot...
6534 2018-07-24 11:47:03 i've always taken fish oil for my joints. i've never seen it suggested for this sort of thing.
6535 2018-07-24 11:47:02 The US exports little over 2%.  The Straits of Hormuz have 20% of the world's oil going through it.  The US supply wouldn't change anything.  A protracted conflict that would shut down or hinder that flow would tank the global economy from the bottom to the top.
6536 2018-07-24 11:47:01 It’s about that oil
6537 2018-07-24 11:46:56 Turkana should be the wealthiest county considering oil is being mined... it's sad to hear #TurkanasouthCDFmisuse
6538 2018-07-24 11:46:55 I don't really understand the whole oil crazy, treatments on skin don't permeate past the dermis... If it were true then you could take a bath and never have to drink water to stay hydrated... So in short it's aroma therapy
6539 2018-07-24 11:46:51 Chef McElroy cut up some tinsel, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a blue stop sign, along with cheese.

6541 2018-07-24 11:46:33 From Cuomo CNN. Trump wants war with Iran, and the only support he will have is from Russia. Russia then able to control Straits of Hormuz . This oil flow from the Gulf, with New Naval bases. Possible !!!!!
6542 2018-07-24 11:46:24 Iran recently abused and thrashed India when India refused to buy Oil under US pressure, Brahmin Hindu Raveesh Kumar said Chabhar port is now under jeopardy after US sanctions, meanwhile China and Pakistan already joined and invested in Chabhar port.

6561 2018-07-24 11:43:56 it's a real cluttered design. people only say it's good because it's memorable, and it's only memorable because of exported aids and imported oil.
6562 2018-07-24 11:43:49 I think it's wrong to say that "truth is subjective", more that truth claims need to be analyzed with an eye for bias of claimant.

In this sense, pomo is actually to Marxism what oil and water are to each other. Pomo analysis would view Marx as reductionist and deterministic.

6573 2018-07-24 11:42:14 But Trump is doing a nice job of raising the price of oil. Putin sells more at a higher price. Thank you useful idiot.

6580 2018-07-24 11:41:03 Imagine the whole World switched from trading in Dollars . I think that would be a Big blow to America having actually trade things of value as opposed to paper you printing ? So if we started trading Oil & Gold etc in Ruble's & Yuan . Would be fun to see the world then :-)

6601 2018-07-24 11:37:26 Agree all you doing is building up Russia financially, supporting their free flow of oil through Crimea port and screwed are farmers with tariffs setting up Russian farmers to supply the soybeans China. Rosneft, drilling oil in the Antarctic? Not enforcing sanctions on Russia....

6613 2018-07-24 11:35:00 Did you know...

The reason why fuel prices fluctuate so much is because the price at the pump is based on the cost of oil.
6614 2018-07-24 11:34:54 When Trickle drove for Cale the sponsor was Phillips66 no burgers then. Hence the Reese's peanut butter cups. Cause you can't eat oil or gas.
6615 2018-07-24 11:34:52 Lies. Watch him take on the US senate over the oil for food smears. There never has been a scrap of evidence to back up your claims.
6616 2018-07-24 11:34:51 Probably even before then too because I always used castor oil since we got from the hospital.

6622 2018-07-24 11:34:14 As long as the money men cover the planet in houses, oil wells, fracking sites etc and they pay there taxes even governments don’t seem to care. The leader of the free world won’t acknowledge climate change and if the biggest won’t what can the small man do?
6623 2018-07-24 11:33:54 And I will not curse a leader of His ppl. Many's the time I had to come up for air, take in the fresh air of the Sts, 2go before our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament that he may anoint my spirit with the oil of gladness.

Trump is now acting in a manner which confirms this suspicion. Countries will choose the lessor of Russian influence over USA
6630 2018-07-24 11:32:40  that boy better eat pap ka fish oil
6631 2018-07-24 11:32:40 Depends on the customer. Some like the resilience of oil, others hate that it yellows. Personally, I still haven’t come across a water/ hybrid that comes close to oil for finish.
6632 2018-07-24 11:32:32 Is everyone forgetting Bernie's Dem Socialist Platform?
I read it. 
The platform included nationalizing banks, utilities, and energy production sector (they already had health care). 
Yet, 18 mos. after Obama, our oil sector ready to be #1 producer. We're exporting LNG.

6641 2018-07-24 11:30:55 Environmental quality is another market failure, because the cheapest most competitive choice will always be to use resources with abandon, and to ignore the long term cost of short-term use. For oil to be a competitive commodity, we mustn't calculate it's total "cost" of use.

6644 2018-07-24 11:30:23 That’s kind of why I feel he’s chumming up to Putin and wants the sanctions gone. It’s why he wanted to rip up the Iran deal. Ideologies aside, illuminating sanctions allows for expansion of Rosneft. Tearing up the Iran deal will improve the market for Russian oil....
6645 2018-07-24 11:29:39 Surely he is not concerned with human right .The funny thing is that he is dancing with Putin in Helsinky and at the same time tweets with harshest method ever against Iran . So it is the Iran natural resources and oil  that matters for Trump
6646 2018-07-24 11:29:32 I use olive miracle and this oil that i got from this lady but she’s always had a lot of hair.

6652 2018-07-24 11:28:23 The oil exploiters should have a legal requirement to avoid negative impacts on local needs. Support at home avoids driving population to dangers of migration path. Surely we have learnt by now of the consequences of greed? Perhaps not.

6714 2018-07-24 11:18:03 I am confused. Are you saying this is a bad or good thing if the US was the world's dominant oil player and China needed US energy? Putting aside collateral damage from possible war.  I am just confused by the nature of the tweet

Massaging with coconut oil is another effective natural remedy to lighten dark circles. Due to its moisturizing quality, coconut oil also promotes smooth skin and prevents wrinkles and fine lines under eyes.

Almond oil is a great natural ingredient that is very beneficial for the delicate skin around your eyes. Regular usage of almond oil will help fade your under eye circles. In addition to almond oil, you can use vitamin E oil to eliminate dark circles under the eyes.

6784 2018-07-24 11:04:41 Just FYI utilities have been warned about this for YEARS. They did not want to pay for infrastructure upgrades.  Oil refiners, natural gas pipelines, water systems are ALL equally vulnerable.
6785 2018-07-24 11:04:40 || Maybe a back and shoulder massage with some oil might help relax you. 

Or some spray like deep heat spray might help with the pain. You could always take a painkiller.

6801 2018-07-24 11:02:30 Listening to it. One point about the Allied Bombing campaign-German production actually increased the last year/months of the war - the loss of oil fields and strategic metals slowed them down.
6802 2018-07-24 11:02:30 Focus on oil exports, oil finances, oil tankers and most importantly focus on oil workers going out on strike.

It's an LA take on the story of Hanukkah, the menorah & the oil. :)

Olive oil contains a lot of nutrients and antioxidants that help improve various skin problems including stretch marks.

6830 2018-07-24 10:58:30 Personally I prefer to fill heating systems with bisto gravy as it helps combat the ever present oil smell they produce 
6831 2018-07-24 10:58:25 I never know with this game, you seem to die from everything  will you add a feature like drinking oil or something then it kills you 10 minutes later? This will be a very last minute resource though.
6832 2018-07-24 10:58:25 When u have an African leader like buhari who doesn’t respect democratic institutions or free speech at this very point in time. It’s really unfortunate. Look at the killings destructions, arrest of legislative heads. western powers, UN are silent because it’s not mugabe.  OIL
6833 2018-07-24 10:58:16 It's called being a "career politician". A snake oil salesman. A slimy, lying, sociopathic fraudster. This is why many don't trust him, people got fed up with this fake "say one thing do another" politics years ago.
6834 2018-07-24 10:58:14 Just pour ground(ed) ogbono inside hot oil. Then pour meat stock inside. You can put okra when it gets viscous. Elite soup, it basically cooks itself.
6835 2018-07-24 10:57:40 Good idea, many countries have banned pork and punishment is stringent on use of swine meat.
But i beleive only India would be labelled "intolerant"! 
Had thr been no oil, gulf countries wud hv starved in scorching dessert. World tolerates Saudi just as they have oil.
6836 2018-07-24 10:57:40 Imp it also gives us oil in rupee instead of dollar..big relief in terms of cad..hope India don't cut down oil from it in future under us pressure!!

6855 2018-07-24 10:54:07 Another Oil Money down the drain; another Niger-Delta-Money; another Tax Payers Money down the drain. It is unfortunate that we are so cursed with a government that has forgotten everything. Ask Chief Obasanjo, former President, he will remind u that Government is a BAD B/man
6856 2018-07-24 10:54:02 I think health care for just amarican citizens is possible for the budget if u lower government employees wages in all states especially in californa and then attack iran before they kill anymore Christians and take there oil as spoils of war
6857 2018-07-24 10:53:52 Commodities will continue to be used across various industries, but less are used when generating solar power as opposed to only generating from hydrocarbons.

6936 2018-07-24 10:37:52 Solar energy is a true renewable resource.Most of planet earth has the ability to collect some amount of solar power.
Solar energy is non-polluting, does not create greenhouse gases,such as oil based energy does,nor does it create
waste that must be stored, such as nuclear energy

6945 2018-07-24 10:36:47 Dark thought for the morning, literally: what if we kill the oil companies and it's not enough, and the solar lobby is able to block funding for solar radiation management projects?
6946 2018-07-24 10:36:14 That sounds pretty much like Russia’s plan for the US. The results are the same, too, and it ain’t peace. Iran has oil and the US has abundant resources, including people. Shut up Ari.

6964 2018-07-24 10:31:53 One can also see it in a different way: dependency of US economy on the oil price has increased significantly over the last two years.

6984 2018-07-24 10:27:05 USA has invaded more countries in name of WMDs and abuse of human rights, however, the main motive has been resources like oil. Their military industry complex profits from creating war and then selling weapons to those countries.
6985 2018-07-24 10:27:03 Rain and flooding all week in Virginia. Too bad we don't have a pipeline to move some of the water to drought areas. They say it's too expensive and difficult to build. If it was oil it'd already have been done.

7003 2018-07-24 10:24:32 I guess I agree. There was limited foresight on a number of subjects, eg losing their limited oil resources to Akwa Ibom - downturn in economic opportunities etc but then again wasn’t that putting eggs in one basket?

7011 2018-07-24 10:23:33 Iran will respond with equal countermeasures if US tries to block its oil exports, Iran foreign ministry said on Tuesday.
“If US wants to take a serious step in this direction it will definitely be met with equal countermeasures from Iran,” FM spokesman Bahram Qassemi said.

7078 2018-07-24 10:11:30 Agreed. Also Lisbon and Porto are not Portugal, it's a fact tourism is booming mainly in those cities. There is also a dangerous real estate bubble. And like Luís wrote above, the article is a blatantly propaganda for an olive oil company.
7079 2018-07-24 10:11:16 He became a suspect few hours after buhari has knelt to beg him,  with oil wells even,  senior man Saraki said No!  He suddenly turned to a suspect.

7089 2018-07-24 10:09:29 Given many of the stories coming out of China (melamine in milk, fake vaccines, gutter oil, etc.), we should be grateful for food safety regulations governing the mainland's edible exports to HK.

7102 2018-07-24 10:06:56 Yes my foot too! Just know that PMB is no better than him. How will @MBuhari be said to have offered a known corrupt man an automatic ticket, a senate president seat, huge sums of cash and oil well? Where is the integrity y'all been shouting about? Integrity my foot!
7103 2018-07-24 10:06:54 So I just tried some CBD oil to see if it helped with my aches and pains. This needs to be on the NHS immediately if not sooner. Aches mostly gone, barely perceptible fogginess. This is incredibly good.

7112 2018-07-24 10:05:15 I resent the fact that this administration would roll back the mileage requirements and other regulations. This forces the consumer to purchase more fuel. Oil win, screw consumer.

7197 2018-07-24 09:49:49 We have also evolved under different evolutionary pressures, so I am sceptic to general health advice such as “olive oil” is good for everybody. Maybe if you originalet from a region where olivs grow, but for somebody from Scandinavia or China, I’m not so sure.

7205 2018-07-24 09:48:32 I think you need to look a lot closer to home to see why Saudi oil gets the treatment it does.

7206 2018-07-24 09:48:26 I’m pretty sure peace isn’t their ultimate goal. More likely installing a puppet to our puppet to Russia so they can manipulate oil prices and supply.

7226 2018-07-24 09:45:41 Good for you. I don't have a ramp squad and I stand by my investment. #MYN is producing oil at a decent rate which more than covers current costs and is bringing more wells online at little cost to the company.  Mot production equals more revenue equals profit.

7273 2018-07-24 09:37:59 ...Nigeria has exported all its oil as crude and then reimported refined petroleum, such as petrol and benzene. That has been a lucrative racket for the middlemen who scheme over import contracts and who concoct ways to scam a system distorted by subsidies. @FT @AlikoDangote

7333 2018-07-24 09:29:05 1. Not true 
2. Increase in transportation is due to the governments rackless increase in petrol
3. Transnet has a budget for that and also investment for both private and public sectors.
4. The dollar exchange doesn’t affect petrol price it affects Gold

7627 2018-07-24 08:34:53 Most important: If the fish oil gives you any fish taste burp, its rancid.

If they add lemon, it’s solely to cover up the rancid fish taste.

7635 2018-07-24 08:33:27 This is not important because until all West buying Putin's oil & gas (yes, Putin the only owner & proprietor of all russian oil, controls all export in few corps.) - he is able to survive and collect resources for what? Looks like for future bigger military strike on USA or Nato
7636 2018-07-24 08:33:16 Basically, Arabs are selfish racists much much more than Europeans. They measure everything by money. The money became the measure of everything for them.

7764 2018-07-24 08:08:46 The same Govt also spent $3 billion looking for crude oil in the Chad Basin when IOC declined to do a joint venture. Nigeria Air is a continuation of a trend of money invested in economically unviable projects
7765 2018-07-24 08:08:42 2016. Oil has risen since then to almost twice its price. Old news.

7767 2018-07-24 08:07:53 You called me dumb even though I never said I don’t understand basic economics. You say I don’t even know how the oil market works. You think you’re clever but you just a brainwashed black soul a wasted sperm in South Africa. U don’t even know what I am capable off.

7775 2018-07-24 08:06:20 Hi Liam, I started reading this before I knew it was you & was thought wow, this engineer's young to have had a grandad working with gas  Unless it's town gas, natural gas is relatively recent. Oil before that which is where much innovation had to take place to switch from coal
7776 2018-07-24 08:06:02 Quick scroll through Twitter and I am left with an amorphous, pervasive anxiety like a sheen of oil on my skin. Can't even put my finger on what I'm stressed about because there's so much to feel guilty for not doing more about, and so much to dread
7777 2018-07-24 08:05:34 The treaty allowed Iranian oil on the market, which brought oil down to 30$ a barrel giving the US cheap gas

Now oil is over 80 dollars a barrel leading to higher gas prices

This high oil directly affects Russia who’s economy is based on high oil prices
7778 2018-07-24 08:05:30 In my opinion you are a snake oil salesman posing as President.
7779 2018-07-24 08:04:53 @Zwelinzima1 good points on SAfm. The ultimate beneficiation? Grow hemp for biofuel. Even if we pay more, we pay ourselves billions, instead of billions to Opec, Nigeria & Angola while bend over a barrel of crude oil at the mercy of the market.

7924 2018-07-24 07:36:49 Aah I thought the gin has rose oil or similar in it! Think this is spicier, on their site their recommend it with tonic, but if you didn't like it maybe try a Martini?

7933 2018-07-24 07:35:37 CBD oil but you really have to research. I just joined some groups that review on FB. It's not the same as THC. I've controlled my anxiety successfully with weed since 2009.

7952 2018-07-24 07:31:36 You didn't ask why Saudi Arabia wasn't on the list. It's not on the list because of the oil relations America has with them. Simple. I didn't say the Supreme Court was racist either. Don't put words in my mouth.

7956 2018-07-24 07:31:03 Special needs are underfunded. Nadhim Zahawi said LAs decide how to spend money. NO! Central government’s allocate money to LAs. Cut back in funding means CUTS IN SERVICE! This from Tory MP who made £370k from oil firm with debts of £470m whilst small investors suffered losses.

7960 2018-07-24 07:30:25 Maybe Indonesian palm oil is priced cheaper than M'sian palm oil? Lower cost factors of production? Or, maybe, China is savvy in playing off palm oil producers against one another? And driving hard bargains? Because the EU is turning against palm oil?

7964 2018-07-24 07:29:01 What's it to you if someone decides that he wants to have (or be able to have) more than one generator - a combination of solar, wind, steam and oil? When there's not enough wind, count on sun. When there's not enough sun, count on steam/oil. Also, depends on what I can afford.
7965 2018-07-24 07:28:37 He's continually caught out lying (like about German crime rates and how much oil comes to them from Russia to give just 2 examples). I don't know whether he's making them up in the spot or being fed them so he's unaware he's lying, but either  way very dangerous & irresponsible

8034 2018-07-24 07:14:16 It shouldn't be smoked in the first place. This is a type of herb that is better consumed as an oil. But people have the right to live how they want so long as they don't harm others. People that judge people like that are doing things to impress others. They seek validation

8040 2018-07-24 07:13:28 Am I scared of real work? No. I already make more than $15 in my career. Even did my time in the oil fields in Alberta as a geologist.

8109 2018-07-24 07:01:59 People should stop using olive oil and think it is want heals you, it is not, it is the power of god that heals not the oil. Funny that the Pentecostal Christians criticize the Catholic for worshipping the rosary and they do same with their oil.

8220 2018-07-24 06:39:36 My best pop fact about this is that until the 90s, olive oil was sold by swedish apothecaries as a laxative and was primarily known for this purpose. My mother (the retired nurse) still feels weird about using olive oil on food.

- Occupies Syria
- increased NATO troops on Russia border
- sent US warships to Black Sea
- sent weapons to Ukraine
- sabotaged Russian oil deal
So they’re unconvinced on “collusion”. They’re right
8253 2018-07-24 06:33:31 It takes an oil tanker 15 miles to stop, and 2 miles to turn around. It takes a speedboat a lot less. Big businesses won’t change the world, startups will.

8267 2018-07-24 06:30:10 It seems a sensible precaution does it not, certainly for medicines and kitkats.  We know how childish the EU are likely to be in the short term.  The Government also stockpiles oil by the way.
8268 2018-07-24 06:30:04 Scott's verse is strongly mannered, and Turner's oil painting; and we cease to be accepted.
8269 2018-07-24 06:30:00 Saudi is probably going through a very tough recession. Oil prices are up, there’s no longer a subsidy on consumer goods, and taxes are being imposed. Which inherently made people question their spendings. I.e the ratio between needed and wanted goods is decreasing.

8276 2018-07-24 06:28:23 Like the deforestation due to the oil companies thirst for fossil fuels across large parts of South America?

8306 2018-07-24 06:22:52 Ahh, the terrible oil.  America was made with oil.  If you hate it try living without it.  Get rid of your car, stop heating your home (rental probably), give up makeup and every petroleum based product.  Let me know when you are compliant.
8307 2018-07-24 06:22:46 Sadly, false expectations that Turkana black gold would positively transform peoples' lifestyles might become real OIL CURSE

8314 2018-07-24 06:21:19 1. One of my favorite things about music in English is that sometimes there are certain parts where it sounds like they're saying something in Spanish. 
For example, "We're Not Gonna Take It" by Twisted Sister sounds almost like "Huevos con Aceite" (eggs with oil) ....

8316 2018-07-24 06:20:27 He probably ran off of the roof because Kramer chased him off. He was the only outside element introduced to Pigman's state of being. His enthusiasm towards the pig men drove his muse literally over the edge. Kramer would replay this crime with a ball of oil.

@McDonalds will be transforming 1.5 million litres of used cooking oil to generate biodiesel for running its refrigerated delivery trucks.

It means reduction of 4K metric tonnes of carbon emission which is equal to planting 2 lac trees

8484 2018-07-24 05:48:03 Iran was prob trading their oil through Kenya &funding MB terrorist ops.Looks to me like they cut the supply line both ways.They're considered a terrorist organization by many countries incl Egypt. It needs to be done. BHO wanted everyone to buy the idea that they are"moderates."

8508 2018-07-24 05:42:17 For decades Iran has threatened to hold the Persian Gulf and the Straits of Hormuz hostage with mines and other military assets.  It's mostly been bluster, but it's a possibility to shut down A LOT of oil trade.
8509 2018-07-24 05:42:12 私の理解を超えている
8510 2018-07-24 05:42:06 Saudi went from almost extinction to the riches family density and we gave the all the land because they were the only musslims that would agree to sell us oil. This is why Iran is really running a deception campaign. Real reason the 911 papers were a secret cause it was a set up

8514 2018-07-24 05:41:29 Will someone tell Meghan McCain that the money that Obama gave to Iran was their money. The money was frozen when US embassy overrun and the diplomats were taken hostage.  The money was to purchase goods, as well as oil revenues. The propaganda is appalling. Conservatives lie.
8515 2018-07-24 05:41:27 Same here. Haven’t broken out like this since high school - which was probably the last time I wasn’t on the pill. I was never this greasy though! It’s physically uncomfortable to have this much oil on my face

8563 2018-07-24 05:31:41 Americans love Iranians, I personally respect your great wrestling team.

8581 2018-07-24 05:28:47 will oil ever see $66 on Brent again?  maybe....but in all likelyhood....there is less than a 3% chance.
8582 2018-07-24 05:28:38 I’ve never had oil. The church I went to in the 80!s would lay hands on people in prayer. The pastor of the church had an affair.  After that the church went off into the deep end. They hookup with Wayland Jennings. He is phoney. I believed he passed away.
8583 2018-07-24 05:28:15 Why r we bragging abt being a prime  delivery port when we are producing enough out frm under us 2 B totally energy independent? This was promise yrs ago. Let us drill; no imported oil. I look frwd 2 ur response.

8630 2018-07-24 05:19:12 You know what we mean from typical FB keto stupidity : gorge on mayo, bpc, olive oil and then worry about having an extra ounce of meat. I'd say BPC is the last thing i'd tell new comers so as not to confuse them.
8631 2018-07-24 05:19:01 Libya oil profits lifted People into middle class status. The same could happen here once we stop bailing out wall street and subsidizing oil. We could save $11 million USD per day by stopping the payment to Israel. Lots of ways to recirculate our money back into our Economy.

Our new Industrial Age wasted.

8640 2018-07-24 05:17:54 Gabriel is correct Felipe. Fungibility requires equality of characteristics. Eg, a one ounce pure gold coin in my pocket will buy the same goods or services as one in your pocket. Raw oil has many grades - light sweet crude, high sulfur, tar sands - these are not fungible.

8647 2018-07-24 05:16:52 1. Oil contracts are increasingly purchasable in other currencies
2. The world is going to move away from its dependence on oil.
3. Gold wasn’t tied to oil, wasn’t a form of fiat and was very stable
4. The bigger question to me are stablecoins vs Bitcoin, not stablecoins vs fiat

Trump allegedly has been rhetorically measured re: Russia but Obama actually was weak.

@potus has made life harder for Russia diplomatically/economically thanks to revving up our oil/gas production.
8716 2018-07-24 05:04:21 I bought dry banmian for lunch... but the sauce is so bitter???? So I added sesame oil, soy sauce and pepper and now I don’t even know what I’m eating LMAO it definitely tastes less bitter but this is a weird ass flavour I’m sad I wanted good food
8717 2018-07-24 05:04:14 Yes, that’s the sad part. Me and pans of hot oil don’t really work well together though. My favorite are the (fried) VegTimes jelly donuts.
8718 2018-07-24 05:03:31 Oh nice! I use lavender oil essence (coconut oil or olive oil as a base) and it helps so much
8719 2018-07-24 05:03:24 I really don't have issues with surplus we're recording from Jamb, Customs and other IGR's. But why are we still borrowing? Why are we still struggling for survival? Why is fuel price still at 145 naira even with the price of crude oil going high in recent times?
8720 2018-07-24 05:03:16 for one manic panic is not bad for your hair its just made from  vegetables and is natural and temporary but yes bleach does hurt your hair a little and in between showers use coco powder thats what i do or coconut oil
8721 2018-07-24 05:03:15 @our oil you still think the old way when Mengistu left the likes of u said US made a deal and again now U mentiond 20 TPLF forced to resign Lol! There own action abuse and corruption made the people to hate them and forced them to leave if not herd body wohld have been drugged

8726 2018-07-24 05:02:34 It has been a dream of Bolton, Guiliani, Pompeo and others (remember the letter congress sent to Iran when Pres. Obama was negotiating the Nuclear deal) now they are attempting to create another false war for various reasons...oil, money, keep Russian Party in office, MARTIAL LAW
8727 2018-07-24 05:02:30 I love craft warehouse, hobby lobby, any place that sells copious amounts of art supplies I literally smile ear to ear walking around looking at them all. Testing prismacolors, looking at oil sets, feeling Bristol board. It's my happy place.

8730 2018-07-24 05:01:30 Always buy meat from deli, either chicken, turkey, ham & occasionally Scottish rare beef. Then usual, cress, rocket, spinach, cucumber, spring onions, beetroot & tomatoes. Some virgin olive oil on top.
8731 2018-07-24 05:01:09 Try castor oil, hair oil, or a terrorism crisis.
8732 2018-07-24 05:01:03 I'll never get as much male attention as when I'm doing something with my car's engine. It's like white knights can hear me unscrewing the oil cap a mile away. It would be charming if they all didn't act so surprised it's my car #yesThisIsMyRealCar #ICanPourLiquidsAllByMyself

8747 2018-07-24 04:59:08 Lol! The Washington Examiner basically the Sun Myung Moon paper now owned by son of a oil tycoon billionaire Philip Frederick Anschutz. They are peddling misinformation for power and more wealth. Greedy old white men. Come on man, you can do better and protect our democracy.
8748 2018-07-24 04:59:02 And they have the largest oil reserves in world. What a waste and squander. This was once the richest country in Latin America by far. In the 90s Venezuelans would fly to Miami to shop and return the same day. Now they are starbing.

8775 2018-07-24 04:53:16 Okay and? Jill Stein's a nut but that doesn't degitimize the #NoDAPL protestors at Standing Rock. Bringing up Stein in this context is irrelevant. F*ck the corporate fascists trying to build an oil pipeline on indigenous land & f*ck Comey for sending the FBI to aid them.
8776 2018-07-24 04:53:06 I can’t believe we are even having to sell this. Train the coal workers to maintain the solar farms. I’m talking out of my ass and have no idea if that is viable, but the GOP isn’t going to rest until every lump of coal and every drop of oil is extracted from Mother Earth.

8779 2018-07-24 04:52:09 I find it so emotionally exhausting to reach out to people to talk about what we're doing. It feels like an imposition/snake oil salesperson.

Even though I genuinely believe what we're building is so helpful for microservice development!
8780 2018-07-24 04:51:58 When oil prices came down, the central govt increased excise duty. The increased revenue was utilised to complete road and other connected infrastructure. Several road projects were stuck during the last few years of UPA 2.

8788 2018-07-24 04:50:53 Thanks Avery! I think there's something new in that the flavours are in a new form, cannabis oil. They are isolated by using a rotavap, low pressure distillation used in perfumery, rather than added like in vape oil. The system has potential for fine control.

8889 2018-07-24 04:31:46 Yessss, and after youre done apply argan oil while its wet. You can also apply when its dry. Ppl say castor oil helps more, i havent try this but you can do this at night before sleep

8964 2018-07-24 04:18:31 You don't understand the market. Saudi dumps and pumps excess oil to kill their competitors in America and Russia. Once they kill them off they Jack the price back up.
8965 2018-07-24 04:18:24 It’s the second time I’ve seen this and just checked. Yup, I’m still just as pissed as the first view. Asia is definitely a mega shit tornado dumpster fire created oil slick.
8966 2018-07-24 04:18:08 A) People would've died had Saddam not been removed, including many children of starvation as he beggared his own country by embezzling money from the 'oil for food' programme b) they're definitely culpable to some degree, but mostly the US.

8968 2018-07-24 04:17:28 I cannot follow this. Again, I have to cite the oil rig rescue, the bus crash, stepping between Chrissy and Ludlow, deciding to turn himself over the government, saving the girl in Mexico - all actions he takes unbidden.
8969 2018-07-24 04:17:27 We don't know what was said behind closed doors but he kicked Russian diplomats and sanctioned the hell out of them..plus he called out Germany for being oil from them..Not judging on a press conference

8983 2018-07-24 04:15:19 MINABLE coin backed by oil!!!!!!!!!!!!
8984 2018-07-24 04:15:07 行かなきゃ行かなきゃって思うほどに体調悪くなるうぐぐぐ
8985 2018-07-24 04:15:00 Given how many collars some oil producers have used for hedging, they may actually be breathing a sigh of relief on this price pull back. Perhaps some of them may buy back those sold calls, to polish their upside participation number ahead of investor disclosures in Q3.
8986 2018-07-24 04:14:52 I’ll be using sweet almond oil from now until death. It’s been my holy skin grail lately *throws away all other lotions and oils*
8987 2018-07-24 04:14:51 So there is now a market for used oil .
8988 2018-07-24 04:14:42 Richest country in the world. We can obviously afford to do things the right way (especially if we cut moronic oil subsidies and military industrial complex handouts)
8989 2018-07-24 04:14:29 Starting to put mct oil into my coffee like a real asshole
8990 2018-07-24 04:14:04 i’ll bring the oil
8991 2018-07-24 04:14:03 Very true.  In the days of W, much of the nation was outraged.  He stole his second term when he actually lost. He lied to America about needing to go to Iraq.  It was all about oil.  It wasn’t as plain as day like today... many disputed. That and 9/11.  Some conspiraciesare true
8992 2018-07-24 04:13:51 "The grooviest and craziest things in the world cannot be cuddled or even ingested - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
8993 2018-07-24 04:13:50 So... does CBD oil help with insomnia? Does it inhibit deep sleep?
8994 2018-07-24 04:13:34 Did a bunch of car stuff myself today: rotated tires and changed the oil. It’s not hard stuff but I do enjoy doing it myself. 

Except when it’s 105F out.
8995 2018-07-24 04:13:22 So here I thought my wife is a better cook than her mom, but it turns out she just adds a ton of oil and salt to stuff when she's cooking for me 
8996 2018-07-24 04:13:17 I avoid everything w coconut oil 
8997 2018-07-24 04:12:48 湿布は貼らんけどな
8998 2018-07-24 04:12:40 Only reason the U.S wants to conquer Iran is its oil and mineral wealth.  That's it.  Never been about nuclear weapons or terrorism or democracy.  Resources, full stop.
8999 2018-07-24 04:12:24 And the coal and oil companies he bends over backwards to help, and never criticizes ?  I'm sure their records are spotless, right ?
9000 2018-07-24 04:12:24 Or oil or the sun
9001 2018-07-24 04:12:13 I hope this tea tree oil works out for me
9002 2018-07-24 04:12:10 So just to be fair about it, how much money has @WolfForPA taken from the oil and gas industry?
9003 2018-07-24 04:11:51 She's still stuck in Oregon, and y'all are not putting this right. Your franchise drained her oil, didn't put any in, told her it was ready to go. The engine is a write-off. She's a 1000 miles from home AND YOU NEED TO MAKE THIS RIGHT.
9004 2018-07-24 04:11:38 Como eu viva antes sem bio oil?
9005 2018-07-24 04:11:35 After I went to school for Master Aesthetics I hate taking medicine. Natural remedies is soooo much more better. I don’t even take medicine for my headaches I use peppermint oil on the back of my neck. #ThankMeLater
9006 2018-07-24 04:11:33 Oil is a waste of time. Expensive machines to suck carbon compounds out of the ground for energy

Suck light from the sun gives us 1 kilowatt per square meter/yard

A 100m by 100m city block getting half the light with half the area, is still over a megawatt in temperate zones
9007 2018-07-24 04:11:29 Isn’t it not being a real gym MORE reason to stay clothed?  I mean, can’t be much to see if they’re “working out” there.
9008 2018-07-24 04:11:13 Almond oil. it works on me
9009 2018-07-24 04:10:55 I do not agree with your fundamental assertions.  You were a little young then, but Bill Clinton's sanctions on Iran resulted in the UN humanitarian Oil for Food program, which will likely happen again.  We've had sanctions against Iran, in various degrees, since 1979.  /1

9034 2018-07-24 04:07:46 Just completed the sloppiest oil change of my career. My car was definitely upset with me for lagging. 
9035 2018-07-24 04:07:45 Thats just bullying. Where is the proof of oil drilling and that being a conflict of interest. Why wud he support other EV manufacturers. bmw has a plant in the US. Swinging monkeys...
9036 2018-07-24 04:07:34 A big part of earnings will be the currency hedging as much as the oil hedging, but at $69usd oil with a 1.26 usdcad, most Canadian companies were looking at $87cad per barrel. Much improved from what was roughly less than 70cad for many in Q1.
9037 2018-07-24 04:07:28 Hey Stevie, did you know that extra virgin olive oil comes from only the REALLY UGLY olives?

9043 2018-07-24 04:06:50 Ask yourself why they were bothered by Carter wanting to replace oil with renewable energy and his installation of solar panels on WH, which evangelical approved Ronnie removed upon moving in. They're, simply, conservatives, and anything not conservative, they label un-Christian

9056 2018-07-24 04:04:44 You forgot to mention Trump’s oil drilling off our beautiful CA coast.
9057 2018-07-24 04:04:42 Imagine it’s 1984. Your gin taste like pee and oil. Your tv just yelled at you to stretch harder. You just had to change history for your day job. Life is good, you think, because war is peace, right?
9058 2018-07-24 04:04:31 most hash oil tastes like el generico weed concentrate but every once in a while you get shit that tastes like mangos or pine trees so just remember to savor the little things in life fam

Was he paying for oil or something?

9077 2018-07-24 04:00:25 Trump wants to export us oil to europe and grab oil market share from iran. Iran wants to stop that. Not many know the economic reasons behind this but there u go.
9078 2018-07-24 03:59:52 貼らぬ
9079 2018-07-24 03:59:51 I’ve moved on to bash Trump on his new statements like threatening War w/Iran, you must not be pleased with that. If you’re right about Putin’s wealth or lack of, then more reason why he wants sanctions lifted to drill for oil. Hence his symbiotic relationship with Trump.

9122 2018-07-24 03:53:56 the point is that it is NOT oil. It is a highly toxic petroleum that requires vast amounts of fresh water to separate the tar from the sand and in the process is the world's largest CO2 producer.

9251 2018-07-24 03:33:39 Because of oil money, Saudi Arabia is rich, both in aggregate and per capita; so it should be considered a 1st world nation. On the other hand, because of its huge population, China is rich in aggregate but borderline medium or poor per capita, so 2nd world status is about right.
9252 2018-07-24 03:33:15 Yeah. I think recipes could be better. I definitely want everything like that out-of-line since it's also important for the steps to be very easy to read correctly, while in a screaming hurry and covered in oil or whatever

9261 2018-07-24 03:31:35 Big oil. Removal of sanctions. A piece of that elusive pie worth zillions. Tied to kompromat. RNC was hacked, too. No fear of repercussions from US can equal their fear of repercussions from M0sk0w. So, in a nutshell, greed and fear, and the power to hide such in distractions.

9269 2018-07-24 03:30:34 I just saw a YouTube comment where a guy claimed that he uses leftover frying oil as lube and I don’t think I’ve ever been so disgusted
9270 2018-07-24 03:30:17 Lmao I took out some food to cook but I just took the best shower and put coconut oil and baby oil all over me. Im taking a nap!
9271 2018-07-24 03:30:13 Butuh almondnya aja. Barter sama garnier oil cleansing sama waternya?
9272 2018-07-24 03:29:35 Nigha i cant roll im thinking of investing in oil or making edibles...

9274 2018-07-24 03:29:22 Was outside checking the oil in my car and got pooped on by a fricken bird. This is what I get for trying to be an adult...
9275 2018-07-24 03:29:17 So, you threaten Iran, creating an unstable market, driving up the price of oil more, something you said that was all taken care, but it wasn't. Now your referring to yourself in the third person. Troubling...
9276 2018-07-24 03:29:17 "i have 99 problems and coconut oil solved 102 of them"

9280 2018-07-24 03:28:48 Kindly explain the oil price funda. If prices increase in International mrkt, govt increases it daily by 20-30p/day though increase is slow & steady in International mrkt. But prices fall by 7-8% in Int mrkt, govt reduce prices by 7p-11p.
9281 2018-07-24 03:28:40 Oh no!!!  I hear tea tree oil does a good job at deterring them!

9296 2018-07-24 03:27:11 I really love roasted brocolli and garlic. Super easy to make! And fried carmelized carrots are super good too. Slice them up in butter or oil and then fry with a bit of honey or sugar 
9297 2018-07-24 03:27:02 I recommend a mud mask and good toner for breakouts that need to be gone asap. I like the glam glow mud mask and Burt’s bees toner. the mud mask pulls the oil out and then the toner kills the bacteria
9298 2018-07-24 03:26:57 #Crude, my own formulas chart are showing price will go up. But not 100%sure. Need to wait for tomorrow closing to see if it's a "Fat Victor" pattern.#oil #aramco

9315 2018-07-24 03:23:37 It’s absolutely incredible to restrict the flow of oil and increase the price of oil, thereby allowing the Russian pipeline to become essential to the flow of oil.
9316 2018-07-24 03:23:28 There are certain sectors (oil and gas) that make huge profits AND pay their employees, even low skilled entry level positions high wages. Why can't other corporations like Walmart do the same? Or at least come close to what the oil fields pay?
9317 2018-07-24 03:23:26 McDonald’s will convert used cooking oil into biodiesel for its delivery trucks. Hardcastle Restaurants, the master franchisee for the burger chain in the West and South India, launched a pilot in Mumbai last year, which now covers 85 outlets in the city.

9331 2018-07-24 03:20:49 They absolutely had a democracy.
We overthrew it because the Brits got upset they nationalized their oil, and reinstalled the ousted Shah. Who was the usual strongman we install, leading to a domestic, hard-line Islamist anti-western revolution, because no shit
9332 2018-07-24 03:20:40 No Dear,
I said, they didnt include the part about peace-they didn’t! And, they claimed he replied to a threat-there was no threat!
Rouhani responded to the US stopping Iran's oil exports; and hostile policies!
trump threatened!

I wouldn’t imagine you would admit your error!

9404 2018-07-24 03:11:19 @chadbensonshow name one terrorist attack in this country by a Shia (Iranian). All done by Sunnis(Saudis ) What has Iran done to us? Oil prices will go up. Good for Russia (Putin) What was talked about secretly Putin/trump? Oil prices/Iran
9405 2018-07-24 03:11:17 Hey Don are You Profiting Off Oil/Gas Market Volatility? Anyone else watch Gas Prices Spike Heavily After Dotard Donnie made his Temper Tantrum Threats? Who is Investigating Dotards Family, Friends, Business Partners to see if They had Large Recent Transactions? I Smell a Rat!
9406 2018-07-24 03:11:05 Who knew that increasing minimum wage would magically transform America into a small country whose entire GDP comes from oil exports? Glad we have brain geniouses like you to save us from that wretched fate

9409 2018-07-24 03:10:42 DO NOT PUT COCONUT OIL ON YOUR FACE it is comedogenic and will clog the SHIT out of your pores. witch-hazel however is fine and makes a fantastic toner. follow with a moisturiser intended for facial use instead.

9413 2018-07-24 03:10:22 Castor oil is really doing something for my eyebrows. 
9414 2018-07-24 03:10:17 "just like a star across my sky - just like an angel off the page; you have appeared to my life - feel like i'll never be the same. just like a song in my heart - just like oil on my hands... honored to love you"

9417 2018-07-24 03:10:13 Now that's a first! CLSA'S Laurence Balanco says oil is likely to remain rangebound in the near-term, Momentum lagging for further upmove. Oil can test trend support of 200-DMA at $68.9/bbl, next support area can been seen at $61-65/bbl
9418 2018-07-24 03:10:11 Trip to France to visit an oil distillery, perfume shop eat crepes from a beach vendor and then perform a burlesque show for all females. I didn’t go and I was ready to come home. #RHOP

9422 2018-07-24 03:09:48 Kaya what do you know about Iran? What do you know about sanctions, what do you know about the JCPOA? What do you know about Mossadegh, British oil and the CIA? 
Because if you don't know anything about any of these things maybe you should stick to singing.
9423 2018-07-24 03:09:32 Not even. Agriculture, beef, oil, software development, shipping, entertainment, and tourism are all huge industries in California. You don't understand the role of Democrats if you think they're motivated by what normal people would consider rational standards.
9424 2018-07-24 03:09:29 While working on my next oil painting, I listened to your Voice songs and your CDs.  I was satisfied that my time was well spent.  You are an amazing composer and singer.  Shine on Sawyer, shine on.

9477 2018-07-24 03:01:39 I worked at a restaurant that didn’t allow children. Now, being as it was fondue, there was open flame and boiling oil on the tables. So, no kids (under 10) actually made sense. Also, it meant we won “Most Romantic” year after year after year.
9478 2018-07-24 03:01:30 I thought it was to warn them of strait of hormuz so oil doesn't go up.
9479 2018-07-24 03:01:27 This would scary conflict due to one we are terrible in the region.  Two they seem more organized and ready and would be a bigger military hurdle and three what are we going to do turn every country their on their head until we have all their oil

9484 2018-07-24 03:00:56 Hundreds of millions of years ago, Alberta was a swamp full of wildlife.

9502 2018-07-24 02:58:37 Although high oil prices get blamed if you think about 2008 it wasn't caused by oil prices. Matt Simmons felt a true global recovery would come w a high oil price. A global recovery is the last thing central bankers want. Oil is a good scapegoat for them.

9540 2018-07-24 02:53:49 there’s olive oil sweeping down my phone 
9541 2018-07-24 02:53:44 They all make alright points but enough for a whole article?  the water-who tf cares as long as you're drinking water. Coconut oil, alright point but meh. Don't agree  and the bars. A lot have tons of crap, but the ones that don't, help a lot
9542 2018-07-24 02:53:29 I was supposed to do this freaking honey and coconut oil treatment on my hair tonight.. I done got super lazy.
9543 2018-07-24 02:53:01 He’s a wolf in sheeps clothing. A literal snake oil salesman. He’ll tell you himself. It’s pretty funny that ppl get blinded by all of the good and kind, Which he is, but it’s totally not all he is. He’s also a shrewd businessman. He’s cunning. And I’ve seen the man get angry.
9544 2018-07-24 02:52:59 i love coconut oil on my body right after the shower , my body be so soft 
9545 2018-07-24 02:52:58 Contained: olive oil, rice vinegar, fish sauce, soy sauce, lemon juice, peanut butter and garlic. Super delicious. 
Seasoned the salad with ground pepper and chili flakes. (There was enough salt in the dressing and mushrooms/steak)
9546 2018-07-24 02:51:44 แต่ก็ยังเพราะอยู่นาาา
9547 2018-07-24 02:51:26 But he doesn’t.  He puts words based on no reality first.  You’re being fooled by a snake oil salesman
9548 2018-07-24 02:51:23 A lot of people have tried recommending it to me.  But I have been afraid to try it since I have pain med contracts with my doctors.  I’m not sure if CBD oil is a “no no”!  But I am super curious about it.  Any kind of relief though....I would love to have more information.
9549 2018-07-24 02:51:14 My God what happened to her?
9550 2018-07-24 02:51:00 #Trump has moved on from #NorthKorea onto #Iran, eh? Iran has more oil after all. 
If you seriously think he deserves a nobel peace prize, you deserve a round-house kick square to the jaw.

9553 2018-07-24 02:50:41 Ignoring corruption funded by a gigantic oil and natural gas organization, the Russian government, doesn’t seem very compatible with progressive goals.
9554 2018-07-24 02:50:34 hi I would just like to say I love my oil diffuser. That is all.
9555 2018-07-24 02:50:31 Yared this is Ethiopia’s compromise on Nile. It was political from the beginning, PM Dr Abiy will get a better deal out of it. Emirates already deposited $1 billion US dollar in commercial bank of Ethiopia. There will be more to come, like cheap oil from Saudi and other US aid.
9556 2018-07-24 02:50:26 Probably would've, but the U.S. went over to steal his country's oil.

Cuz it's so low, I take it to FnA performance 4 oil changes. Owner Dustin rode Harley Drag bikes & says my bike scares the living shit out of him!
9559 2018-07-24 02:49:50 Yes, Oil price alone dictates our prosperity. History has proven this. It's disingenuous to say otherwise.  
 If we used the $1,000,000,000 (wasted money) that is the security cost and advertise all the positives this city has, we would get the same or better result.

9570 2018-07-24 02:48:11 Tonight I went to an essential oil class and took a test to see what oils I need. All the oils it suggested had to do with acne. I now feel personally victimized by a computer program.

9601 2018-07-24 02:44:14 Oh yeah. And in the first cars they're drinking oil. And when mater leaks oil in cars 2 they act like he peed. So they do eat and they do poop and stuff. Wtf.

When skippers group got shot down did they die then? Did all the vehicles of the war just die?
9602 2018-07-24 02:44:08 I’m an ENT and I did quite a bit of literature reading on it. They do nothing for inner ear infections but can help with outer ear infections (swimmer’s ear). Though it’s because the oil is a bit acidic, which is why good ol’ white vinegar can do the trick (also a LOT cheaper)
9603 2018-07-24 02:43:59 garnier all-in-one micellar water! strips away dirt and oil, and it doesn't dry out your skin. and it's really inexpensive, like 6 dollars i think?

9631 2018-07-24 02:39:22 will they do same for iran oil ?
9632 2018-07-24 02:39:18 OIL SHOULD BE $20.00 PER BARREL
9633 2018-07-24 02:39:04 I got an oil change and rotated my tires today.
9634 2018-07-24 02:38:58 He'll simply order, no, tweet an order to strike Iran or attack an Iranian oil platform or blow up an Iranian ship or worse, order a shoot down of an Iranian airliner. There r ppl n the military who'll carry out his orders. No questions asked. I'm convinced of it.
9635 2018-07-24 02:38:55 Actually we are over $200 trillion if you count all of the unfunded liabilities.
9636 2018-07-24 02:38:47 btw castor oil bisa menebalkan alis juga gak? -ns
9637 2018-07-24 02:38:39 matter fact, i bet they make the oil in a clandestine lab in china and smuggle it. Formula probably banned by the FDA
9638 2018-07-24 02:38:37 For sure! @Ally reimburses $10 per month on ATM fees so that comes out to anywhere between 5-10 withdrawals depending on the ATM charges. There's others that do this as well so maybe look into em so you can save! Avoid a few ATM charges and you get yourself a free oil change ;)
9639 2018-07-24 02:38:34 I put castor oil on my lash line and I swear theses mfs grew overnight.
9640 2018-07-24 02:38:33 They SAVED all their money from the oil. We squandered ours. They still pay in but have no say. They're a rule taker not a maker. That's not better than we have at the moment, its worse.
9641 2018-07-24 02:38:30 Exactly how did THIS President do that? By arming the Ukranians? 
By calling out Germany's perfidious purchase of Russian oil/gas? 

Or maybe you mean the last president who ignored the annexation of Crimea, the invasion of eastern Ukraine, the shooting down of airliners?
9642 2018-07-24 02:38:23 I just leave them in there for like 2 nights so they soak up every drop then wash and rinse the bottles when I'm done! If there is goo on em a lil lemon oil and boom.

9650 2018-07-24 02:37:26 is it weird that i find joy in plugging in a brand new air wick scented oil?

9668 2018-07-24 02:35:06 Its certainly obvious that Tartus naval base will stay along with Russian air bases. Also that Assad will remain in power. However the oil & gas fields should be exclusive to whoever controls that region. Setting up an autonomous Kurdish area will require backing from Turkey.

9671 2018-07-24 02:34:48 I'm not sure if I'm wiser, but I learned that the privatization of military, militarization of corrupt local police, racism,genocide of indigenous native peaceful peoples who have land treaty rights,is clear & present, oil companies own fed government, that they can be defeated.>
9672 2018-07-24 02:34:46 Putin isn't missing from the list. Trump just got criticized over his anti-Putin comments made at the NATO meetings regarding the oil/gas pipeline to Germany.

9674 2018-07-24 02:34:43 Making your own oil is super easy and cost effective. Just buy cbd isolate, and mix with your own MCT coconut oil, you save at least $20 per bottle. Stirring the isolate in the oil and then microwaving the dropper bottle is the easiest way to mix it well.
9675 2018-07-24 02:34:41 Boiled in oil
9676 2018-07-24 02:34:35 The US is producing plenty of our own oil. Calm your tits, gas won't be $15.
9677 2018-07-24 02:34:26 CBD oil has been a lifesaver for me. As my doctors work on treating my bipolar disorder, treatment for my anxiety has taken a back seat. It doesn’t fix everything, and I still get anxious, but it’s manageable. I feel like I can live again 
9678 2018-07-24 02:34:17 So you where loving Obamas war on coal. His war on oil, ranchers, farmers, the middle class, rural America. white America. logging. And just making life harder on everybody

9680 2018-07-24 02:34:14 my color-changing oil diffuser arrived and i’m feeling so at peace rn
9681 2018-07-24 02:34:10 I wonder if they’ll serve me if I’m wearing my “I  Oil Sands” shirt?
9682 2018-07-24 02:34:02 You spelled "oil" wrong
9683 2018-07-24 02:33:59 Resumes no longer matter if these boneheads are ready to drill the Grand Canyon for oil. All are unfit criminals, creating fake universities or saying “yes”, in fear, of Trump. Who wants that?
9684 2018-07-24 02:33:40 Replaces lube with motor oil
9685 2018-07-24 02:33:37 i need oil blogging paper and a new lip liner for monsta x im trynna be on my best bitch energy
9686 2018-07-24 02:33:26 And more explosions. One was a gas well pretty near me. Another burned/killed rig workers at site. Another one was a saltwater injection well explosion but no one hurt. All in past 4mos. Greed knows no bounds when it comes to oil and gas production. Sad.
9687 2018-07-24 02:33:14 Fuck that. Society needs more than just snake oil salesmen desperate to start businesses. Nurses, librarians, teachers, custodians, researchers, etc, should all be able to earn a basic living.

9689 2018-07-24 02:32:56 A few drops of lavender oil( or you oil of preference)on your yoga mat before you actually do yoga really makes a difference
9690 2018-07-24 02:32:46 Ummm what exactly has he given Russia?  The man put Germany on blast for dealing with Russia in regards to oil.  If he was in Putin’s pocket how does that work for Putin????
9691 2018-07-24 02:32:44 @HeidiHeitkamp   Since you love North Dakota.  Have you  camped in T. Rossevelt Park lately and wondered why the wildlife have disappeared?  Just look North to the fracking and flaring.  Look east to the next oil refinery. Who voted for that??  Save ND!!
9692 2018-07-24 02:32:43 And when that Trump dingbat puts tarriffs on Canadian oil to boost American shale and off shore production and quebec threatens to leave again because we cant afford to subsidize their inflated social programs... “why didnt we build a pipeline out west!!!” The screams will be.

9699 2018-07-24 02:32:18 Yeah, but the fosil fuel ppl don't give a shit about making jobs for ppl who need them desperately! Only after they suck every bit of oil and natural gas, then they'll buy up all the renewable energy companies! Big pharma, oil companies and n.r.a. own the US!
9700 2018-07-24 02:32:10 I see a lot of oil byproducts there.

9718 2018-07-24 02:30:20 Maybe so, but until then its good to see america leading again. Plus no matter what renewable energy takes the forefront we still need oil for the countless other petroleum products we use. Ya know, like the device you're typing on.

9720 2018-07-24 02:30:09 Why are there SO many crazy people in the US. Too much soda pop, maybe. Or hydrogenated oil. Maybe it causes permanent brain damage.

9723 2018-07-24 02:29:57 From a “kid that can just lift a lot of weights”, to becoming one of the youngest drillers in the oil field at 19, to a 3.9 degree and on track to a 4.0 degree, both in airplanes. Every step taught me valuable life lessons that I’m completely thankful for.

9729 2018-07-24 02:29:19 These plants should be considered in any regimen to empower the body. In aromatherapy, oil of amber, from the resin of the pine tree Picea succinifera, is recommended as a energy balancer. It is known as the king of scents. Amber has been used since beginningless time. #Meditate.
9730 2018-07-24 02:29:11 Just like when he opened ANWR and the Outer Continental Shelf for oil production. Love it! He needs to expand power in congress then fire Sessions.

9735 2018-07-24 02:28:25 @Y_Strahovski Yvonne can I ask you, being an Aussie, how much you enjoy following Aussie musical artists:  Bee Gees, Olivia Newton-John, Men At Work, Little River Band, AC/DC, Easybeats, Midnight Oil, etc.?  And do you think that Serena Joy would have enjoyed them before Gillead?
9736 2018-07-24 02:28:14 Is she the new running model for mazola corn oil?
9737 2018-07-24 02:28:01 You mean pseudomedicine/snake oil?
9738 2018-07-24 02:27:41 I thought he was replying to tweets about the map. But I guess he's saying that the US doesn't like that Iran has nationalized their oil? If that is what he is saying then haven't the Saudis also nationalized it, and I'm guessing other countries have as well, e.g. India, etc.
9739 2018-07-24 02:27:34 Sarcophagus juice is just the first stage of turning into oil, as we all will eventually of we are not cremated. Why are you all so obtuse about old bodies?

9741 2018-07-24 02:27:22 Frankincense is the only oil that can make me calm
9742 2018-07-24 02:27:18 The U.S seems to have problems with every country that has oil and gas  take a hard look at Israel  and don't forget people of the world are not crazy we all know that all your talk is all about the oil and gas
9743 2018-07-24 02:27:15 Apparently he’s a lame duck anyway. Good catch, Borat.
9744 2018-07-24 02:26:55 The biggest wave of electric cars is coming. Starting with Ford offering 18 new models in 2022. Less than 48 months from now. GM to follow. The era of oil is ending.
9745 2018-07-24 02:26:41 It would make a beautiful oil painting too. 
@Official_tylerg See this photograph? Maybe you could (if the couple are identified) do one of your paintings for them? 
You as a photographer, have not broken any laws as you were in a public place & your intent is kind to find them.

Under new government, our country still doesn't have clear directions. Still clueless

9758 2018-07-24 02:24:23 She sprinkled a bit more flour over it, then whirled the mixed ingredients around in her hands after having poured the searing hot water inside.

9766 2018-07-24 02:23:13 Al-Basrah Oil Terminal (ABOT), Iraq.
9767 2018-07-24 02:23:13 So there’s an old oil heater in my basement and we thought it was empty and attempted to move it. Well it still has a good 20 gallons of oil in it and we managed to spill about 8. If me and @smalllz6 don’t make it through the night, just know we love you all.
9768 2018-07-24 02:23:10 I don’t know why it took me so long to hop on the coconut oil for everything train but just know I’m on it now and riding till the wheels fall off

9771 2018-07-24 02:22:18 Sad part is that he's picking on the wrong guy and doesnt even understand the ramifications of is actions. Muslims states will not stand for it. Watch the retaliation, no more oil , attacks on Israel.  Dumbass will start WWIII

9774 2018-07-24 02:22:04 $120 oil will do more to fill  vacancies than the Olympics. I have seen multiple boom & bust cycles, nothing fixes a bust better than another boom. Would love to get off this roller coaster, but a two week party is not the way out. Especially with a billion dollar security bill.
9775 2018-07-24 02:21:42 Looking for oil in the desert?

9779 2018-07-24 02:20:56 Need to get restrictions on the sale of Iranian oil
9780 2018-07-24 02:20:54 This seems more suspicious than a deflection.There are overlapping and contradictory interests among all Sunni countries,Russia,US,and Iran-Syria.There are oil pipelines, markets,and there are Trump's financial interests,and finally the anti-Obama GOP baggage over Iran Deal.
9781 2018-07-24 02:20:46 PresTrump armed Ukraine, told Merkel2cut oil pipeline to Russia,competes w Russia’s sale of oil attacking their economy,strengthened NATO by get them pay more, opposed Russia ally Syria killed Russ soldiers, imposed strict sanctions hurt their economy. U ask such a silly question
9782 2018-07-24 02:20:38 Cold or heat packs might work hun. Like u said it maybe cos u done a long walk or growing pains. Hot bath in some lavender oil or menthol may work if its that. Hope she feels better soon
9783 2018-07-24 02:20:36 Ouch! Are you okay? I spilled piping hot oil on my hand once. Not fun. I can only imagine the pain you’re in now.
9784 2018-07-24 02:20:35 What rant? It was one Tweet confined to 280 chars. The murderous Islamic regime in Iran has threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz (an international sea) through which 18MM/Bpd of oil is shipped.

By showing strength he is preventing a disastrous war which can jeopardize the ME
9785 2018-07-24 02:20:28 Need to go downstairs for coconut oil but lazyyy
9786 2018-07-24 02:20:27 That's oil on canvas?! That is stunning. I can't imagine how that looks person.
9787 2018-07-24 02:19:58 Besides potatoes in any form? Broccoli. Oven roasted broccoli in olive oil and sea salt.
9788 2018-07-24 02:19:36 electrification, autonomy and ride-sharing are Long term OPEC killers, permian oil is doing the short term
9789 2018-07-24 02:19:25 Really wish I had oil for my bf’s board so I could go skate 
9790 2018-07-24 02:19:23 We are exodusing Sodom and Egypt where our Lord was crucified, and we're entering Zion by the transfiguration of our minds by the holy anointing oil without measure. #GreatGrace #GreatAwakening

9796 2018-07-24 02:18:37 hydrogenated oil is pure death , would be infinitely healthier to just use good ole rendered fat. You CAN make a survival candle out of crisco though, will burn for damn near a month!

9802 2018-07-24 02:18:06 In this weird peninsula, it's when you stop drills that oil comes out
9803 2018-07-24 02:18:01 Coconut oil can fix anything

9806 2018-07-24 02:17:44 "Oil Can!!"
9807 2018-07-24 02:17:37 Actually, cannabis oil (backed up by Harvard research) is a proven treatment that not only contains cancer growth but can clear it. It has a record of success, but radiation therapy is a billion dollar industry. They don't like this alternative
9808 2018-07-24 02:17:35 I would boil it in oil and feed it to the sharks.
9809 2018-07-24 02:17:33 "flaxel, canolo, oliff and palme"

9819 2018-07-24 02:16:22 Stagflationary: slower growth & higher inflation.

The negative supply shock that could come from trade war, higher oil prices due to politically motivated supply constraints.
9820 2018-07-24 02:16:07 Just covered my face with rosehip seed oil and it looks like I just dunked my head in a bucket of greasy fried chicken 
9821 2018-07-24 02:15:56 Does it count if there is tea tree oil in my shampoo?
9822 2018-07-24 02:15:46 Whip together 8 oz gumbo with 8 oz dumplings. Mix in Olive Oil. Fry. Serve with love.
9823 2018-07-24 02:15:45 My mom made me put on this “natural oil” that’s supposed to help me destress, but it literally just smells like my dad’s Old Spice deodorant.
9824 2018-07-24 02:15:34 How do you like tea tree oil? I feel like it’ll burn. So I’d probably just to peppermint

9826 2018-07-24 02:15:24 Two nation was created in the name of religion by British colonial state with the purpose of controlling the oil of Gulf. Just watch movie "Viceroys's house"a plan of Churchill"The rulers were planted with clear purpose. If one has clear vision can read what's written on wall
9827 2018-07-24 02:15:18 Coconut oil is better than lotion. Don’t burn.
9828 2018-07-24 02:15:10 Yes! As George Carlin wisely once said, “let’s be clear. America is an oil company with an army.”

9849 2018-07-24 02:12:32 I wish other countries would follow your lead for example canada and its natural resources not allowing foreigners to take the oil or the natural resources and send elsewhere for us to buy back and for bank of canada to print money for Canada
9850 2018-07-24 02:12:25 Its tough with oil stocks. The guidance will be ugly. Uncertainty, war, etc seems to be priced in. String dollar will crush oil
9851 2018-07-24 02:12:23 Yeah, me neither. I bought some new artwork for my classroom walls and an essential oil diffuser. I’m tapped!!
9852 2018-07-24 02:12:21 WHAT an #ass x problem is I can’t decide if I should spank it, eat if or oil it up and fuck it??

9854 2018-07-24 02:12:06 This article didnt mention that he has sent arms to Ukraine and has demanded our NATO allies increase their military spending.

Oh. And in the next 2-3 years we will become the leading oil and gas producing country in the world. (Not good news to Russia)
9855 2018-07-24 02:12:02 Acrylics and Gouache  good to go on wood (though I seal it afterwards with UV Krylon Spray to keep it clean). Oil you must gesso or seal the wood or it will seal and become a big mess.
9856 2018-07-24 02:11:44 It’s about the straight of Hormuz. Russian and Saudi oil. This will back fire. They’re calculated. And calculated to Russia.
9857 2018-07-24 02:11:43 Nope, the facts are facts, we created those terrorists, just to have a reason to invade. The CIA has publicly admitted that it was behind the notorious 1953 coup against Iran's democratically elected prime minister Mohammad Mosaddeq, for British Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, "BP".

9863 2018-07-24 02:11:15 I had 3 surgeries last week. I am having trouble digesting food or even wanting to eat. While the palm oil I'm ethically opposed to (deforestation, non renewable, this needs to change), I think I've finished like 5 bags. 

All the Bamba, all the time.

9869 2018-07-24 02:10:38 Why is the American Right so against environmental protection?  Is it simply a hatred of government and regulation or something more complex.  Other than Big Coal/Oil and the Koch Brothers who else is behind it and why

9886 2018-07-24 02:08:58 trump saber rattling spooks the market driving up oil price. Putin rolling in the dough.
9887 2018-07-24 02:08:48 Clark's first scene in Man of Steel, the fishing boat gets the call about the oil rig fire. The captain asks about survivors and the voice on the radio says they are dead, the captain turns to ask Clark for his binoculars and before he even turns around Clark is gone.
9888 2018-07-24 02:08:48 This is a win win for GOP & Putin, The NRA (GOP-all hunters) get to bloodlust & Murder all our Wildlife, Putin gets control over all our public lands for his Oil & Mining Interests Killing agencies F&W, already been killing 200 Million a yr, currently removing all Wild Horses
9889 2018-07-24 02:08:45 You know it’s peak summer when you can’t even remember the last time your coconut oil was a solid
9890 2018-07-24 02:08:34 Looking for jobs in the UK, preferably in London or just outside of it. In the fields of sustainability or palm oil. Anyone wants to hire a Malaysian for that? There’s a willing one here 
9891 2018-07-24 02:08:29 Chad, are you aware of everything going on with Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn, Popadopolous, Gates, George Nader, Rosneft oil and Gas company deal with Qatar, Kushner and Flynn and back channels to communicate with Kremlin? Those are just off the top of my head
9892 2018-07-24 02:08:12 JAK made me an essential oil blend that I absolutely love. I’ve been using it in my products and what a difference. Her knowledge of essential oils makes her the best in her field. Thank you JAK for my amazing blend.
9893 2018-07-24 02:08:05 Believe me I didn’t want to do lasik and then when I found out about my oil glands I was like “I would rather not wear glasses every day they make me ugly” lol... I’m terrified but I know it’ll be worth it!!
9894 2018-07-24 02:08:04 Also:
Why is Trump pushing NATO members, successfully, to increase Defense spending?
Why did Trump Bomb Russian pet Syria, twice.
Why did Trump allow US military to obliterate a group of 500 Russian Mercs?
Why is Trump upping Natural Gas and Oil production to compete with Russia?

9901 2018-07-24 02:06:27 That hatred we have sown has come back to haunt us in the form of terrorism. Instead of sending our sons and daughters around the world to kill Arabs so we can have the oil under their sand, we should send them to rebuild their infrastructure,
9902 2018-07-24 02:06:09 This is what a fail state looks like. This country has the largest oil reserves in the world. It should be nowhere near its current state. How the Chavez/Maduro " 21st-century socialism" looking?
9903 2018-07-24 02:05:51 Maybe if you didn’t trash the environment for short term gain from oil sales the water wouldn’t be so hard to treat?

9909 2018-07-24 02:04:23 i want a massage  with oil
9910 2018-07-24 02:04:15 Fiat USD is 'backed' by the requirement that every nation-state on Earth must always be buying USD in order to buy oil from Saudi Arabia. Since every country needs oil, every country needs to always be buying the 'USD dip'. This is the only 'stable currency' peg I will trust.
9911 2018-07-24 02:04:09 I just finished my deforestation with 40oz, Paraquat and 1 gal. per hundred water of crop oil. Nothing survived. 20 gal per acre applied no special tips just some #6 AI flat fans.

We are recyclers and our rebuilt classic cars still use less oil in their lifetimes  then a new "green " Prius does just to be made.
9922 2018-07-24 02:02:21 Respectfully disagree. Evidence of benefit is stronger than that if negative effect, which appears to mostly be rather speculative ties to leaky gut. However, I do agree that leaving all the foam released during a long boil w/o oil may leave a bitter taste that some may not like.
9923 2018-07-24 02:02:17 I used whitening paste on my teeth. The two thing I hate most: turmeric and coconut oil. This is truly a hate concoction designed specifically for me. I’m so disgusted I wanna barf.

9930 2018-07-24 02:01:33 Oil prices are propping them up so far. And we tried it unilaterally under Bush.  They sided with Iran.

9932 2018-07-24 02:01:18 You are definitely doing great job for your country but please stop the harassment of Iranian people their oil is for them not for the U.S God bless them

9944 2018-07-24 01:59:59 They think that putin will give them nice positions, or maybe they’re making $$ off under the table Russian oil deals.
9945 2018-07-24 01:59:56 We need to attack Iraq before they do something horrible like use their influence to raise oil prices or someone finds out I’ve been nailing my male interns. #anotherdayattheGOPCongress

9947 2018-07-24 01:59:32 Just did my first oil change and it was a success! Easy process, saved $20 doing it myself.
9948 2018-07-24 01:59:24 No offense but I really need a bubble bath and lavender essential oil
9949 2018-07-24 01:59:09 Oh, yes to all those things! New potatoes, roasted, then dressed with a mayonnaise (homemade is great but a good bottled one in a pinch...) seasoned with charmoula spices...Heaven. Garden beans with that green Dijon and a bit of good oil. Ah, summer.
9950 2018-07-24 01:59:06 Yo I gave Arnold a bath & I ended up deep conditioning him with my Moroccan oil
9951 2018-07-24 01:58:50 If that's what Murkowski did that leads me to wonder why she would not want Deep Water Horizon protections, esp. if she wants to drill, drill drill. AK DID experience the Exxon Valdez, right Lisa? You want more oil spews in your state? Pls explain your actions. Bought by Big Oil?

9957 2018-07-24 01:58:07 Crimea sanctions coupled with falling oil prices in 2014 put Russia into the famed Middle-Income Trap, currently afflicting Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Russia.

9962 2018-07-24 01:57:25 If you buy high quality canned tuna(better than the old standbys like starkist), packed in olive oil, it will be great mixed w any canned bean, pea, or veg. The olive oil even acts as a dressing or sauce.

9966 2018-07-24 01:57:12 My sisters friend pronounces oil like either "oral" or "earl" and it's the funniest shit
9967 2018-07-24 01:57:09 Idk how i feel about cooking my food with coconut oil. My food tasted kinda funky.
9968 2018-07-24 01:57:04 Reminds me of oil in the water. I wouldn't get a car with that kind of paint myself but it still looks pretty cool.
9969 2018-07-24 01:56:57 I just had it ..you feel like you’re  going crazy ..I took 5 ibuprofen ..quite a bit of liquid Benadryl ..covered my back with Vick’s Vapo-Rub .. I didn’t have the recommended Peppermint Oil ..I laid down & relaxed .. it went away in about a half hour .. don’t shower for 2 days!
9970 2018-07-24 01:56:50 It does Dan.I’ve gotta admit that being someone who got my first job...that wasn’t mowing lawns or working cattle or hauling hay or maintaining oil and gas leases with my dad or bottle feeding calves before the sun came up or working on cars and trucks with my dad ...I was 16.
9971 2018-07-24 01:56:49 Here's the thing: I *hate* putting money into car maintenance. Oil changes. Tire rotation. All of it. But I realize spending money now saves money later. Society works the same way. But with people. And libraries. As an economics prof, you should know this. #SocialGood

9973 2018-07-24 01:56:15 Russia blew it's chance to break middle-income status when commodity prices were high from 1999-2008 because of instead of investing rising oil revenues into industrial and knowledge based industries, it was lost due to corruption among other issues.
9974 2018-07-24 01:56:13 Just a pan with a spoon of oil and  because all the time you have to move it without open it. And then made the caramel with sugar and water
9975 2018-07-24 01:55:45 Anyone ever use CBD oil for pain relief? What’s the best stuff out there?

9978 2018-07-24 01:54:58 Try peppermint oil extract if you haven’t already!
9979 2018-07-24 01:54:54 What are these 2 olive trees?
upon th right side of Th candlestick & upon Th left side thereof? 
12 And I answered again, and said unto him, 
What be these 2 olive branches 
which through Th two golden pipes empty Th golden oil out of themselves?

These are 2 anointed ones.
9980 2018-07-24 01:54:53 Why Trump kills environment protection progress, as emissions controls? Profits; starting with oil.
Who Trump serves allegiance to? Israel repeatedly.
Why Trump confronts China? Economic ripoffs turned unsustainable. 
Why Trump appeases Russia? To weaken their cooperation vs. US.
9981 2018-07-24 01:54:51 Doesn't most of his missiles money and oil money come from Iran?!
9982 2018-07-24 01:54:40 It’s a humbling place to visit. We’ve been there many times with the house right there.  Crazy it happened in my literal backyard birthplace.  Not most efficient drive home that way...but worth the stop.
9983 2018-07-24 01:54:38 jin is literally the weirdest and the best person alive imagine having everything that he has accomplished and staying humble. i cant relate, oil company owners cant relate, i bet you a thousand bucks the big three can even
9984 2018-07-24 01:54:33 Russian poverty is decreasing because oil prices are rising. I wouldn't cheer about a country that is completely dependent on natural resource extraction. It's not good.
9985 2018-07-24 01:54:24 Time to burn the midnight oil doing Previews orders. 

At least I have Marvel, DC, and Image done, so there shouldn’t be much else that I’ll need to overthink too much. 
9986 2018-07-24 01:54:07 The germans have oil back then?

9990 2018-07-24 01:53:55 praying!

i am NOT a doctor, so check with one first, but when i had respiratory issues earlier in life i found that mint or lemon oil in a diffuser helped me.
9991 2018-07-24 01:53:37 *puts oil through braids*   *braids are still itchy*  I can’t win
9992 2018-07-24 01:53:33 Neither was Venezuela and neither are Dem socialists. “Pure” socialism is stateless. Venezuela was authoritarian, had a single, oil economy and has been fucked over by US policy for decades. What’s funny is I bet I get the “educate yourself” as clas started in 8 minutes.
9993 2018-07-24 01:53:32 Futuros Usa verdes
Oil en baja,.!!!
Vamos bien,.!!!
9994 2018-07-24 01:53:32 Do you just use the bio oil as a moisturizer???
9995 2018-07-24 01:53:28 There’s no oil in my yard, but if ants ever become a hot commodity, I’ll be a rich man. #TCMParty
9996 2018-07-24 01:53:22 If oil is made from dinosaur fossils, and plastic is made from oil... does that mean that Plastic dinosaurs are made from real dinosaurs?
9997 2018-07-24 01:53:16 I have no doubt that Moscow Mitch is involved in the Russian saga and it goes deeper than just winning for him.  There was a huge oil deal worth billions before Obama shut it down  with sanctions.
9998 2018-07-24 01:53:12 Try sniffing  or rubbing essential oil lavender and peppermint on the sides of your head wait a few minutes for it  to kick in
9999 2018-07-24 01:52:50 Washed my face with coconut oil now a bitch can’t see
10000 2018-07-24 01:52:45 So jealous of this.
10001 2018-07-24 01:52:40 All we need to do is print more money.  Just print 21 trillion $1 bills and no more debt.  Then we can all live in Bernie’s fantasy world aka Venezuela.
10002 2018-07-24 01:52:35 Picardías peroncho/kirchneristas-3): Entregar territorio a China para una base militar, geopoliticamente extraordinario, pero que EEUU instale una base es entregar la soberanía! Por los 1, 2 y 3 váyanse bien a cagar, pelotudos a fuel oil trucho!
10003 2018-07-24 01:52:11 Aloe Vera and or tea tree oil and turn your shower on hot and steam your scalp and play with the parts the steam really helps
10004 2018-07-24 01:52:00 CBD oil, meditate and come to me for some Breathwork and sound therapy !
10005 2018-07-24 01:51:49 Jett, covered in oil and barging in on the society types (to his own embarrassment) is such a fantastic visual metaphor for the next phase of the film, as well as the next phase of Texas history. #Giant #tcmparty
10006 2018-07-24 01:51:37 Some people/places fawn over the oil. It's usually even pretty much imitation.
10007 2018-07-24 01:51:37 Wow, look at that "Oil Painting Effect"  when you zoom in.. 
10008 2018-07-24 01:51:36 Why leave the Olive oil to jump into a barrel of vinegar?
10009 2018-07-24 01:51:22 Most of Trump’s policies are intended, either directly or indirectly, to Make Russia Great Again. His actions and statements regarding Iran, including withdrawal from the JCPOA, are meant to jack up oil prices, a huge benefit for Putin. Putin’s wish is Trump’s command.
10010 2018-07-24 01:50:56 No. Once someone lays their hands on me, they've forfeited their position on the rules of engagement. Have a nice day.
10011 2018-07-24 01:50:52 Thinkin about oil rigging and leaving to Santa Fe springs
10012 2018-07-24 01:50:45 When it approaches to $1.5 Trillion the oil industry enjoys, we can have a debate.
10013 2018-07-24 01:50:44 Kylie Jenner is a self-made billionaire like Saudi Arabia is a self-made oil country.
10014 2018-07-24 01:50:37 Trump's latest tweet against Iran deepens their existing conflict, with threats to shut the world’s busiest seaway for oil exports. This could result in a spike in crude oil prices. $USO (USD14.09, ↓0.42%), delivers exposure to oil using near-month futures.
