1 2019-03-28 23:58:32 Somebody needs to tell Trump voters to stop spending so much money on their MAGA gear and start saving to pay for medical bills. He’s now asking rally attendees how their stocks and bonds are doing. Not much of a response. Wonder why...
2 2019-03-28 23:58:26 “You want to see your stocks and 401ks deflate? Put a good socialist in the White House.” -Trump in Grand Rapids 
3 2019-03-28 23:57:57 Trump bragging about stocks being up 50-60% again lol
4 2019-03-28 23:57:46 FYI, Michigan MAGA’s don’t have 401K’s or stocks, or bonds.

6 2019-03-28 23:55:48 The banks pumped the #LYFT IPO price to $72, if it flop #UBER is doomed. Yes it's mature but show me your losing balance sheets. Shouldn't you be making money by now. What goes up on hype falls back down. #stocks

7 2019-03-28 23:54:59 We don't need bump stocks!  There is NO practical situation where a BS would be needed.  I'm not losing my ability to defend me and mine or hunt by giving them up. I mean, maybe if we're invaded but come on.
8 2019-03-28 23:52:40 I care about bump stocks being put on guns so that men women and children can be mowed down by homegrown angry American white male terrorists that the President of the United States has encouraged and continues to encourage for his own ends My rights and interests are validated.
9 2019-03-28 23:50:22 @TMFJMo Listening to your interview on Monday's @MFIndustryFocus I came up with your new basket: stocks founded by or run by female CEOs. What do you think?
10 2019-03-28 23:49:41 First off... that is asinine. Secondly... WTF... third, I need your kind of money
11 2019-03-28 23:49:22 I am a huge proponent of #2A.  A member of @NRA.  Had guns my entire life including several AR’s.  I agree with the ban.  Doesn’t the use of bump stocks intrude on the idea the fully auto guns are highly regulated with tax stamps and other docs?  What am I missing?  Thanks

13 2019-03-28 23:48:14 2 most intriguing stocks this week is INDF(ICBP) and JPFA. They both got hammered pretty bad. For now, I don't think selling is not an option. We think for both present a good opportunity to buy. But don't catch a falling knife.
14 2019-03-28 23:48:01 And yet it was a Republican who took away the bump stocks. The Brady bill was named after a Republican who worked for Reagan. Sign should say vote Republican and lose your guns.
15 2019-03-28 23:47:16 Obama is the only POTUS in 50+ years who expanded our 2nd Amendment rights with his signature.  Allowed carry in Amtrak luggage and in national parks and forests. Trump banned bump stocks and said "take the guns 1st, due process 2nd."

That's easy to show.
16 2019-03-28 23:46:30 @PaulSkallas If you had to design a Lindy ETF, what stocks would you pick?

Ford? Kraft? AT&T? Lloyds?
17 2019-03-28 23:46:19 Careful. A lot of this breakout is because many funds became way too overweight stocks and light bonds with the stock run in Q1. They are having to get into ratio now before the end of the Q. The fact that stocks have held up so well with forced selling pressure is a big plus
18 2019-03-28 23:45:58 Aye I like stocks over RE but this recession on the way so hit my line so we can politic  it’s risk hedging season
