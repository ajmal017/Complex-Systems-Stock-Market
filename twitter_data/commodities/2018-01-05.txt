27 2018-01-07 22:10:13 Vg. En US no era ilegal hacer dinero en commodities usando información privilegiada. Sólo hasta 2010 fue penalizada, con una regla conocida como la Regla Eddie Murphy, derivada de la película Trading Places! Ello es prueba de que la bolsa es un destripadero de ovejas!!!
28 2018-01-07 22:04:44 Yes but our clubs don’t care about our national team, hence why our top players pull out of international friendlies with injuries that clear up in time for the next club game, English football is a billion pound industry and everything comes down to money.. human commodities!!

41 2018-01-07 20:32:36 Just finished watching No hunger in Paradise. Heard agents and academy staff overuse the terms Player, Young Players, Young people, Elite players and many similar terms. These are "Children". Some of which still believe in Santa. 

Treat them like children, not commodities!!!!
42 2018-01-07 20:32:09 You are spreading alot of misinformation. Qsr runs labour of around 25-35%. Avg return was pre debt. Average sales of around 2mill.

47 2018-01-07 19:57:17 Calling tokens, stocks, commodities etc. AFTER they've grown by 100% does not an analyst make. That's someone trying to sell their position/bag to a new wave of late adopters.
48 2018-01-07 19:51:37 A real eye opener that. Not enough good practices in terms of non footballing issues  including welfare and finance, across the board. Needs to be more consistency and regulation. Difficult one as it’s clearly not just about the football. Some players treated as commodities

54 2018-01-07 19:06:27 Football is like modern day slavery. #nohungerinparadise is a very good documentary on how young footballers are treated like commodities by clubs.
55 2018-01-07 19:06:15 Anyone moaning about footballers supposedly holding clubs to ransom i.e. Coutinho and Sterling should watch #nohungerinparadise and realise that clubs treat players of all ages as commodities and very rarely as humans.
56 2018-01-07 19:00:21 lol see that kind of stuff down at #SilliconBeach too. It's hilarious cuz they can't execute regardless of what school they went to or how much money they have. Those are commodities.
57 2018-01-07 18:56:29 yes of course but surely it is also bad practice to have trials for 5 year olds, have 6 year olds training with 3 or 4 different clubs. Selling dreams and using children as commodities or spare parts in a system( common in academy soccer) is bad practice aswell.
58 2018-01-07 18:51:25 Congratulations, they have successfully transformed you from citizens into commodities.

80 2018-01-07 16:44:37 Her skepticism is somewhat warranted. Cryptocurrencies are more akin to commodities, in that the market assesses their value. Traditional currencies (gov't issued ones) are implicitly backed by the economies of the issuing organization, even the fiat ones such as USD

123 2018-01-07 10:44:03 Please stop. You clearly don't have decent information on all your tweets so far. They've not embraced green economy? Artisans made boom from sales? They don't pay for other commodities? Transportation and equipments?
124 2018-01-07 10:39:45 While I agree with you Busisa, my humble opinion and mainly based on a variety of commodities is that greed/profiteering has taken hold, industry included.Bird flu will go but prices will not reflect that. Negative response is quick but + is slow.
125 2018-01-07 10:25:24 Technically and discipline-wise sobrang di pa tayo ready for a cashless world hahaha and i don't think we should be, anyway. Yung mid to high level commodities nalang muna ang gawing cashless like jollibee and uber.

133 2018-01-07 09:19:41 Well. Some players are commodities. The club needs to make money. Here is the payment for a good defender or two by selling the unsettled Coutinho.
134 2018-01-07 09:10:16 Take home pay is important!!!
Why?
Because the commodities  purchase is still flexible. In short, we have options/choices what to buy and consume! #TaxReform

Dami ngaw2x andami naman tax evaders pweeee!
135 2018-01-07 09:09:34 Sadly we see all things as commodities, life and feelings are secondary. There are some good humans, but mostly stupid humans. I wish I could save some of those hens but all my animals have to be wild according to my rent agreement

138 2018-01-07 08:47:38 As far as business is concerned, power and labour are both commodities, each to be purchased at the cheapest possible prices. They won't magically start paying more for one overhead expense just because they're paying less for another.
139 2018-01-07 08:28:16 Commodities are not traded through blockchain today. Lets says ethereum-based smart contracts settle commodities contracts in future, that does not mean that a cryptocurrency has to be used in the mix.
140 2018-01-07 08:12:52 You’re comparing apples and oranges. Fiat doesn’t have the swings that commodities do. And no other commodity fluctuates more than crypto.
141 2018-01-07 08:08:31 RT   Alta no preço das commodities fez crescer 28,7% a participação dos básicos nas vendas brasileiras. Exportação de manufaturados também cresceu, mas em percentual menor (9,4%).
142 2018-01-07 07:58:11 Example a bag of rice is 20k depending on location and type, I hear Waec form is over 20k and the minimum wage 18k, food prices and commodities doubled some tripled

How much was fuel... #87, and the Dollar #199 and Now??? #173 and #375..
143 2018-01-07 07:51:50 Capitalism is about commodities and profits. It does not systematically take any consideration of human life and Social ills. A Capitalist has to turn and even bigger profit than the year before. There is no way to do so without degrading the lives of workers and the environment.

148 2018-01-07 06:23:12 Thank you. It's a pity that parents don't take pride in their daughters to have a career but they willingly spend these huge amounts so that they can parade them as prized commodities in search of a moron for their daughter.

156 2018-01-07 04:52:25 The imposition of the excise tax will only resutl to another round of inflation. A domino effect on all basic commodities which majority have yet to feel. The government is once more deceptive by claiming it wont be felt by ordinary tao. The truth is, only the rich wont care much
157 2018-01-07 04:47:18 If a 5% increase in the price of fuel resulted in a 22% increase in the price of basic commodities, then most of the time prices would vary wildly given the behavior of the global oil market. 

It’s that simple.
158 2018-01-07 04:27:36 When folks use the word never it usually occurs shortly after.  Commodities are cheap. When they’re cheap demand accelerates.  It’s coming.

160 2018-01-07 04:12:10 What the gov't is trying to do here is minimizing the sacrifices concomitant with the development and industrialization by exempting other commodities from price increase. The problem with us, Filipinos, is that we are too comfortable with the status quo. (continued)

163 2018-01-07 03:55:17 Doesn’t seem like a major change. It is probably the relative prices of various commodities and other items

165 2018-01-07 03:37:27 The discovery of America, the rounding of the Cape, opened up fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie.

173 2018-01-07 03:02:15 No veo a ninguna farmacéutica aceptando commodities en vez de USD o EUR. No existen estructuras organizativas dentro de ellas para aceptarlos, y luego transarlos.

177 2018-01-07 02:29:26 Whereas, food and shoes are commodities. Supply at a particular store can be ramped up and down very easily. Most of the expenses in their production are marginal costs. These differences prohibit any gain in efficiency from these methods.
178 2018-01-07 02:17:01 Industrialization & organizational innovations changed luxury goods like cotton into cheap commodities.

#AI, #blockchain & other technologies will similarly change “luxury” items like housing & travel. Experiences and learning may supplant products as drivers of time and work.
179 2018-01-07 02:12:16 one of these days, scientists will find a way for us to power our cars with the oil from our faces and we'll be hot fuckin commodities. everyone will be rushin for that Good Oil.
180 2018-01-07 02:07:29 For a while they used that dollar to buy treasuries but they have exited long term debt paper & only hold the short term stuff.

183 2018-01-07 01:29:48 They need collateral. Prime brokers and large asset managers are huge players in repo chains now. BDC’s, SWF’s, commodities holding companies, etc all players. So I think somehow, part of the B/S sell off to foreign CB’s will be used as collateral hence extra dollar demand
184 2018-01-07 01:26:56 I apologize Mark. I didn’t read the blog (looks good by the way) I agree pretty much entirely. Digital dollar credit...it literally requires some collateral. Hence China collaterizing commodities. (In my opinion that’s a part of why they just suck up commodities the past decade
185 2018-01-07 01:22:11 Economics and religion are belief systems where neoclassical economics is the easier to disprove. In order to conjure equilibrium in land, labor and money markets one must assume that the 3 are commodities, things produced for sale. Treated as such-their destruction/consumption.
186 2018-01-07 01:18:27 2018 - Year of commodities. Also 2018 will see bitcoin & Ethereum solidify hold on cryptocurrency market as altcoins fizzle away.

188 2018-01-07 00:51:32 Many commodities put in a pretty big low in 2016 and with the recent fall of the $USD back in 2017 it has helped accelerate some #commodities to the upside. Moving forward in the near future i do suspect the dollar to get some kind of pullback/rally to $94 high or low 50cents

230 2018-01-06 21:33:40 What he means is that the government doesn't recognize either product as as basic needs, therefore, it's a commodity and commodities aren't exempt from taxing. You'd be creating a precedent, that's all, no one's saying you should bleed on your panties.

245 2018-01-06 19:41:10 Btw, the 22% increase in the prices of basic commodities for every 5% increase in the price of fuel was a result of multi year study of London based PEP, Professionals in Economic Partnership.

251 2018-01-06 18:28:35 I find it sickening that a sport I love constantly pays out abhorrent sums of money when we have people without a roof over their heads or enough money to pay for basic commodities and our emergency, teaching and local services are struggling due to austerity measures 


252 2018-01-06 18:24:56 When someone reported there’s a data gap on soft commodities / sugar on your website, you start pretending you know what he’s talking about
253 2018-01-06 18:13:47 I think the government is just recovering billions spent during the just concluded campaigns,kenyans should embrace themselves for more price hikes on basic commodities,i rest my case
254 2018-01-06 18:07:42 You will see the quite clearly issue as these two commodities recover from record lows and go to record highs.
255 2018-01-06 18:02:50 Unfortunately, only in U.S. people lives are treated as "profit centers" and disposable commodities. That malign cultural MUST change.
256 2018-01-06 18:02:07 I normally aspire to all inflation acceptance and new better than old

But in commodities. 1972-1974 was the golden time.   One side inflated. The other didn't

259 2018-01-06 17:49:01 So many irons in the fire, I repeat:

If one of these are successful - $SX is worth well over 1 billion dollars:
1. Game Changing Lithium Extraction Technology from Clay
2. ICO to track, buy and sell commodities
3. Nickel property being compared to Voisey Bay
260 2018-01-06 17:46:18 no, substitute American goods – commodities for actual cash! Get infrastructure & stimulus at same time.
261 2018-01-06 17:39:21 we are in 2018 and when we talk economic growth for the African continent we still talk commodities.

265 2018-01-06 17:17:03 if you dare invest in stocks, I'd suggest underappreciated commodities
266 2018-01-06 17:14:20 As a lot of you check off goals this year, you will be shocked at your potential in 2018. Remember, TIME is one of those commodities that once you lose it you can never regain it. Make sure this year that you manage TIME & not allow it to manage you. #GStraughter
267 2018-01-06 17:04:53 Commodities are huge this year, and the king of that heap are Rare Earth Metals that China controls, there needs to be exploration for that like there is for oil
268 2018-01-06 17:04:14 Bitcoin soon to be Shitcoin. The herd has no idea of CRASHES such as Dot Com, Poseidon, stock markets, commodities. Many of which ended up with investors jumping out of buildings and off cliffs when they knew they were TOTALLY BROKE!  It's coming SOON!
269 2018-01-06 17:02:52 So even as volumes do not fall, dollar value of trade in USD-invoiced commodities might fall. 

This is a common indexation problem. But I will go noodle. I’m sure she’s thought this through more than I have.
270 2018-01-06 16:53:40 A situation where a leader buys a chopper while the people he's leading some of them are sleeping on empty stomachs others can't afford some commodities is commendable. Please leaders go on buy even yatches.

272 2018-01-06 16:46:27 Analysts like UBS said that in 2015 the pound was the most overvalued currency in the World. It was due for a fall without Brexit. Euro is irrelevant as a measure. Commodities priced in dollars, including Airbus.
273 2018-01-06 16:37:50 that’s not realistic from anyone’s end. top 50 draft picks are one of the most valuable commodities in the NFL
274 2018-01-06 16:34:00 Fiat is backed by government not commodities, it would be commodity money.

283 2018-01-06 15:55:52 Quick Q @WBrettWilson   Would have it not been better for the Govt to adjust the taxes for the working poor instead of raising the min wage so quickly? That way they would have more purchasing power? Plus, commodities would not raise in price that quickly?

322 2018-01-06 12:44:43 This is mathematically impossible. Because it implies that fuel represents 440% of the cost structure of basic commodities. When in fact it would only represent a small fraction. If say fuel consists of 10% of the inputs, a 5% increase in it would lead to 0.5% rise in price.

344 2018-01-06 10:14:00 Hi Akira! Racialialized mimicry or mockery, and racializing behaviors or commodities in general, is a problematic practice and has a good chance of being offensive to many, because the results often appear racist regardless of intent. so this practice should be reconsidered.

So no taxes for some of working class pero mutaas ang basic commodities? Which is kinahanglan sa tanan working citizens man o dili?

So is this making the rich, richer and the poor, poorer?

359 2018-01-06 07:05:29 They are commodities in a 3-supplier market, which now allows the remaining players to 'coordinate' capacity expansion and dampen boom and bust cycles. As someone who started my career in DRAM process development 35 years ago, I can tell you it's a far different market now.

497 2018-01-05 19:24:05 Abortion and the sale of murdered baby bodies is already a multi-billion dollar industry! Now the suicide/organ harvesting racket has begun! People are now nothing more than commodities to be traded to the highest bidder!
498 2018-01-05 19:24:02 In a franchise situation, the HO does have some pull. But as all similar outfits are affected the same way, we can expect them all to increase to accommodate. Farmers are not a 'store', and deal in commodities. They are welcome to put their product in granaries, and wait.
499 2018-01-05 19:13:10 well the argument I usually see is "bitcoin is bad because it uses up a bunch of resources", but that isn't necessarily the case. The problem of unnecessary resource consumption is a problem with all commodities
500 2018-01-05 19:11:34 I expect men to be willing and able to treat women as people, not as interchangeable commodities defined by who we are/aren't willing to sleep with.

502 2018-01-05 19:03:53 2018 will be Neo’s year for sure. Wan is also going to be freaking awesome. I’d take RaiBlocks (XRB) and silver commodities in general as my bonus picks.

505 2018-01-05 18:52:34 The paradox of (legal) bans - they help push the reverse agenda by making ideas, commodities more valuable than they might have been, simply due to the “prohibited fruit” pleasures or the resultant artificial scarcity. To fight something, open it up, demystify it and regulate it.

522 2018-01-05 17:43:24 sales growth of S&P yoy is roughly 4.8%
you need sales to boost stocks, or more money in circulation, or rates dropping, or commodities dropping

534 2018-01-05 17:07:20 On the other hand, the quoted price by the buyer is a reflection of other factors:
•Prices of similar commodities in the market which are as a result of 'the curve'
•The buyers feeling on 'the labour cost' in the production which might be right or wrong
•Market forces

556 2018-01-05 16:15:14 So the tax cut going to gas increase expense is not even a fraction of total gas expense? How about price increase on all other commodities needed to survive? The irony is the situation that those below $59k yearly income won’t even feel any positive effect of tax cut law???

572 2018-01-05 15:10:03 Are rising commodities prices the main driver of the 60? The bullet points seems to say efficiencies are overcoming them but if so what is then driving the 60?
573 2018-01-05 15:05:48 Yes it could. Its called Price inelasticity of demand. Certain goods, are essential and therefore impossible not to buy. 

Particularly commodities. 

Also your system has no way of stopping oligopolies or monopolies forming. As I've told you in the past.

582 2018-01-05 14:34:44 Dollar broke on jobs report, and commodities responded, other than the grains that got a bearish USDA weekly export sales report at the same time. Dollar has since recovered. Crude oil sees profit taking ahead of fund rebalancing after rising to 2015 highs. #oatt

595 2018-01-05 13:47:56 Hey Tony. Was this not largely because the dollar strengthened, which  was disinflationary? Has an impact with a lag, & thus the weakness we've seen in the $ in 17 has contributed to rising commodities, PPI etc.  Could we still see limited inflation if dollar doesn't strengthen?

722 2018-01-05 03:29:50 How are we going to get scarce commodities that we do not have....if money is discarded....? Is socialism based on the premise, that society's needs will be abundant and no need to trade or barter with others.....?
723 2018-01-05 03:13:37 Damn, I was REALLY hoping the commodities business they were engaged in was repurposes Somali war gear into stuff like the Yugoslav war memorabilia (things like mini-tanks made out of sniper bullets) like you find in Sarajevo.
724 2018-01-05 03:11:43 commodities babe
725 2018-01-05 03:08:15 Probably not a bad bet Blue.  As you know, CAD is heavily influenced by commodities (incl precious) and they're northbound.  CAD could remain strong for quite a while.
726 2018-01-05 03:03:07 Any appeasement frm DTI on inflation will make no sense. The law intends to hike prices of prime commodities in the market. Companies will do some hedging to leverage on impacts. Increase already started last Monday.
727 2018-01-05 03:00:18 @DtiPhilippines 
With all the speculations going around, wouldn't it be prudent of your agency to publish the SRP of commodities, as a guide to the public?
728 2018-01-05 03:00:08 Top 5 commodities in WI are soybeans, cattle, corn, milk, potatoes.  Which is #1? Go...
729 2018-01-05 02:56:11 Assuming that 100% of the minimum wage earners get cash transfer, weren't they entitled to it before TRAIN? Hence, will still have to shoulder the rising prices of commodities?
730 2018-01-05 02:30:14 how come can they cope up with that if summer will come? Plus the commodities will high its prices due to taxes of oil by train law which is used as a tool for transportation of commodity.
731 2018-01-05 02:20:52 I don't  think it would if you spend only on what is essential.  The high excise taxes are imosed only on non-essential commodities. Nag-mahal ang softdrinks, then stop drinking, don't use aircon.. etc..
732 2018-01-05 02:17:09 Higher excise taxes are imposed only on non-essential commodities. If they have no income, they are not expected to consume those goods.
733 2018-01-05 02:16:24 Yup, sold yesterday before the rise . Hopeless management sitting on some hot commodities and doing very little. Had a few upthrusts over the past few months but settles back down - could be accumulation but serious lack of faith in management is an issue.
734 2018-01-05 02:15:57 I’ve commented recently in the past about where the economy is at. I agree with all of this. But I’ll add this. The next inflation leg that is gathering is food commodities. The softs. Look at those stocks. Wait til that hits the grocery stores.
735 2018-01-05 02:09:33 Would never be 90%. Believe it or not they weren't routinely considered commodities by the masses as they are now until the last 15-20 years. They increased but not by such crazy percentages.
736 2018-01-05 02:05:40 2017 was another strong year for #commodityprices. According to HSBC’s commodity price index, they rose by 7%, adding to the barnstorming 26% gain achieved a year earlier. #CommoditiesTrading #CommodityMarket #InvestinginCommodities #Commodities #Mining #MiningCompanies
737 2018-01-05 01:59:07 @jsorgi in short, do I think children should be treated as commodities, no. But by being a potential revenue stream they are developed to be a soccer player. Here, if you don’t win, the parents stop paying and move to another club. Winning doesn’t equal development in most cases

Equity rising one thing, but commodities unhindered upswing has its downside on economies!
741 2018-01-05 01:51:45 Unlike traditional currency, alternatives have no physical form and typically are not backed by tangible assets.not insured or controlled by a central bank or other governmental authority, cant always be exchanged for other commodities, and are subject to little or no regulation.
742 2018-01-05 01:46:57 Themes for 2018:
Metals. Commodities. Emerging markets. Small caps.

Masternodes. Staking. Projects over price. Micro caps.

Heartland real estate. Commercial to residential conversions. Mixed use. Downsizing.

745 2018-01-05 01:40:54 If by dopes you mean me, someone who worked his a$$ off building homes & swimming pools to pay for his college education which afforded him a stellar job trading commodities who now uses cannabis for pain from 3 surgeries & who doesnt drink or do drugs, then you are correct
746 2018-01-05 01:40:25 Eu não entendi pq há correlação negativa entre SP500 e commodities.
747 2018-01-05 01:39:20 Then again if you are so concerned 
Give up your mansions, your cars, your jets, all your unnecessary commodities and luxuries
748 2018-01-05 01:39:10 Or we could start growing all the stuff we import and stop playing this game where we juggle garbage commodities around the planet.
749 2018-01-05 01:28:23 The price of stocks is determined by the buying and selling patterns of investors. When people are scared about the future they invest in safe commodities like gold. Gold spiked during Obama's first term. It leveled off a bit in his second. I attribute that to unemployment. No $
750 2018-01-05 01:27:45 I’d be all for it then honestly. Club friendly proven commodities are hard to pass up and I think ultimately Riley is a 1B and we know that’s not happening lol
751 2018-01-05 01:22:21 So the 40% increase in commodities encourages us to consume less for things we like most. SORRY, BUT NO BODY CAN STOP ME FROM LOVING COKE.
752 2018-01-05 01:20:48 Drugs do not relax you, they reinforce your violent addiction to capitalist commodities.
753 2018-01-05 01:20:45 BUT proven commodities in Yelich and Realmuto

758 2018-01-05 01:09:41 Looked it up. Been studying it for over a decade. You're flat out wrong on this one Mike. When commodities, and yes labor is a commodity, become cost inefficient a business suffers. In turn, employees get laid off or the price is passed to the consumer. Everytime.
759 2018-01-05 01:08:39 U can literally buy stocks and foreign exchange and commodities and make money every day. Especially in the forex market where trades happen instantly. What is being pushed heavily in JA now is futures trading, but day trading is faster money.
760 2018-01-05 01:08:35 How do you explain march to June 2016? They learned their lesson from the oil plunge in 2014-15. They know they need to deval usd. You are early. Commodities probably spike with curve inverting. Then it's adios

762 2018-01-05 00:59:37 Matt are you a commodities trader?  I am impressed by the interview and insight. As a teacher I always enjoy when I can learn from someone else. So that was not only enjoyable but taught me something
763 2018-01-05 00:52:27 You could use this to teach about colonization & globalization and argue about the merits of import substitution/ the value of extractive commodities to former colonies vs oppressive colonizers.* 
*I realize that the reference is to the movie Frozen, which I haven't seen.

770 2018-01-05 00:21:50 Not only economy but prices of commodities also looking up.Efficient handling of finance ministry or inefficient handling?
771 2018-01-05 00:16:28 “They are not insured or controlled by a central bank or other governmental authority, cannot always be exchanged for other commodities, and are subject to little or no regulation.”  that’s the point

773 2018-01-05 00:10:52 Creo lo contrario. 1) Bernal aconseja bien a sus clientes. Solo al mantenerse donde está se prueba eso. 2) Bernal ha predicho  precios finales de monedas, acciones y commodities. Eso es saber estocástica....
