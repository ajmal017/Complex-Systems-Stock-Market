0 2019-05-29 23:58:30 Do you think the stocks fell because of Mueller or the ongoing issues with China?
1 2019-05-29 23:57:34 Having made it to the countryside, I might only see London for business now.
Surrounded by badgers and foxes, and people invested in each other, instead of stocks and mortar.
Nice change of rhythm, after a riot in the capital.
The next few weeks will be fun. Insha Allah.

4 2019-05-29 23:56:33 Nor do we, but my popcorn stocks are growing. :-)
5 2019-05-29 23:55:29 Well, not the ones I watch. At least a lot of domestic stocks that have the tariff yoke attached still leading the way down. I guess you can argue that now it's GDP related, but still weak today from what I can see.
6 2019-05-29 23:54:16 i dont really look at stocks, but the spx does indeed also look fucked
7 2019-05-29 23:53:42 OBSESSED 
8 2019-05-29 23:52:48 At least Auntie Maxine isn't a fornicator! She should pass legislation making all fornicators wear scarlet letter "F". And put them in public stocks.
9 2019-05-29 23:51:39 I'm glad they are out of the stocks

12 2019-05-29 23:51:26 Morale is really low at my job right now because we have no hours and it’s just a kind of a bummer to be here right now. And apparently company stocks plummeted so things probably won’t be getting better anytime soon
13 2019-05-29 23:51:14 When stocks are falling and you can't stop talking about it i think that's called an un-bear-able market

15 2019-05-29 23:49:53 So buy stocks tomorrow?
16 2019-05-29 23:49:20 FYI Annie, we don't tag blue checked people here. It brings only trouble, and Leftist trolls.

Investors didn't like Mueller today. Stocks down bigly, then not so down later in day. Tempest in teapot to them.
17 2019-05-29 23:49:03 Considering the Famicom had an app to check stocks I believe it
