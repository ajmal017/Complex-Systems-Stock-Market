1 2018-03-17 23:59:39 This guy is gonna get smeared but I bet he’s gains followers. I wouldn’t be surprised if he knows he was being sarcastic and paid @CryptoCobain to publicly bully him. TBH I’m just really optimistic people who consider themselves “in” crypto aren’t genuinely this ignorant 
2 2018-03-17 23:59:18 shouldn't it be the opposite tho ?
3 2018-03-17 23:59:10 6k double bottom bounce or 3k in play
4 2018-03-17 23:58:57 I will never give up on crypto Sir.
5 2018-03-17 23:58:02 As long as I’ve been in crypto loops ain’t been wrong when it mattered I can’t be trading against that man so whatever he say I’m running with

7 2018-03-17 23:57:44 Well, you’ll just publically blame me rather than non socially :)

I mean regardless of the windows machine you’ll just have a virus on it that mines crypto for me so.. whatevs...
8 2018-03-17 23:57:44 Monero is Monero. In my opinion the fork is only creating bullshit for monero
9 2018-03-17 23:57:43 usually when crypto contracts it bounces back to all time highs...but im still skeptical it can do it again. we'll see.

13 2018-03-17 23:56:50 Well, that target on his back ain't gonna paint itself...
14 2018-03-17 23:56:44 Crypto has given common investors access to early stage tech that only VCs had access to in prior cycles. The failure rate of early tech is much higher than most realize. This is a recipe for massive loses. Diversify like VCs do or get slaughtered. $btc #bitcoin #cryptocurrency
15 2018-03-17 23:56:40 Some of these coins are experiencing a dead cat bounce. Don't be fooled. It is most likely a bull trap. Whales want you to panic sale. Keep holding on and accumulating the good deals on quality coins. Get in a good position for that inevitable boom..

24 2018-03-16 23:59:27 If you’re happy to do it using a btc contract which gives you no control over your purchase. When you buy crypto w/ abraglobal they issue an iou tied to a bitcoin contract. You don’t own anything. Be cautious there are a lot of questions regarding their deceptive marketing.
25 2018-03-16 23:59:21 And the best platform is?

27 2018-03-16 23:59:07 I feel like we are in another bear-whale situation.  Some number of people, criminals, who knows, want to convert massive amounts of crypto into fiat.  And they are going to keep doing it, potentially, for months on end.  So much value flowed into shitcoins, people want fiat out.
28 2018-03-16 23:59:03 yos :^
29 2018-03-16 23:59:01 Since may last year I put 8kg on due to crypto  training 6 days a week is sorting that out. Get a bike, smart trainer and hook it to zwift 
30 2018-03-16 23:58:49 Some people talk out of their greedy wishful asses. Those that are already wealthy and have amassed a vested interest in generation one crypto will hark until the sky falls in if it means their investments are safe. So many reasons to choose others, but sheep follow, pipers pipe.

35 2018-03-18 23:59:39 The crypto-currency dominance index should only include monies whose p2p network withstood an attack from 90% of the hashrate + the biggest startups. 

Bitcoin has 100% dominance.

41 2018-03-18 23:59:24 I feel the same, crypto changes ones life 
42 2018-03-18 23:59:22 It's still a bit early to be calling BTC's permanent downfall after only 24 hours in the green for us at IOTA. Let's not jump the gun here just yet. It is still very much the face of crypto currency to the mainstream public
43 2018-03-18 23:59:06 But i am in love with Bitcoin, increasing my sats everytime. what do sir now ?
44 2018-03-18 23:59:04 I wasn’t talking about your TA, I was talking about your shitty attitude. You talk about helping people, this is a perfect example of you just throwing shade at someone...very helpful. Like I said take care buddy.

47 2018-03-18 23:58:49 I'm fairly new to TA but from what i've learned so far those are both bearish indicators.  Correct me if I'm wrong
48 2018-03-18 23:58:45 What's the resistance that you think will push it back down ?

50 2018-03-18 23:57:49 Most likely, but I don’t think we will drop below 7.7k, the 30 minute chart looks to be making a ascending triangle, if it breaks above, we might not see that below 8k dip.
