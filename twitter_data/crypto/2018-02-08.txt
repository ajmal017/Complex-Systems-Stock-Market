0 2018-02-08 23:59:55 For all my other noob crypto peers, don’t keep your BTC on @Coinbase when there is a fork because if Coinbase doesn’t support the fork, you will miss out.... things I wish people told me earlier than yesterday
1 2018-02-08 23:59:50 You said crypto was over and you are launching a coin on a platform you called a scam. Nice reframe here though.
2 2018-02-08 23:59:50 I was locked in but the wife now thinks im crazy and wants me to "quit crypto"...damn it!
3 2018-02-08 23:59:50 @sasha35625 $WAVES you know about my case. Twiggy resounds in help ticket and said they wait for you!  I’ll upload entire conversation to social media.  Send my $WAVES.  What’s the damn problem?
4 2018-02-08 23:59:48 It won't, the lack of regulation being the reason behind this (Ironic, yes).

6 2018-02-08 23:59:40 ... and spend your crypto assets with @tokencard_io $TKN
7 2018-02-08 23:59:38 I’m in even if I’m not invited 
8 2018-02-08 23:59:28 Something tells me that most of newly joined traders are in #Crypto for other reasons than gaining experience.
9 2018-02-08 23:59:22 Bully, I’m not down with the coming wave of influence of the SEC in Crypto in terms of them essentially making everything a security. Most don’t have a $1M, aren’t accredited but want to invest in these new ICOs. Any advice or post I’m sure would be very valuable to the space

13 2018-02-08 23:58:48 And good thing is I need not worry at all as my coins were stolen for good by scammers so may be they are worried now and i guess u guys have d ledgers to protect ur assetts , look at me to whom iam advicing for the legends of crypto community 
14 2018-02-08 23:58:41 I know you will be ok. The good thing about crypto is, if you don’t like the current price of your coin just wait for 2 hours... it will change :) good luck to you
15 2018-02-08 23:58:36 speaking from an investment point of view in the crypto space, its not something i would put faith in. if banks are to replace swift with xrp transactions, ive seen other cases that shows said banks creating their own from testing xrp transactions. Afterall its the DLT no limits
