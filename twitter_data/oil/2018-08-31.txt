19 2018-08-31 23:58:12 It’s easy to do! Visit a city like Barcelona, where you do not need a car. We could have that in the U if we could defeat the strangle hold of car and oil companies.

48 2018-08-31 23:56:39 It is mere exchange rate fell due to import of oil. You can’t help it.
49 2018-08-31 23:56:22 I give up on candles, so I'm ordering an Oil Diffuser as an upgrade. I love a clean smelling room, as it makes me feel comfortable and happy! Am I the only one?

58 2018-08-31 23:55:20 How do you know a con man?  They always complain about how terrible things seem to be and over exaggerate a “problem.”  Then they self proclaim a victory of fixing an issue that never really was.  Did you buy the snake oil or run them out of town? #dumptrump
59 2018-08-31 23:55:08 Did you guys forget that McCain was responsible for an illegal war that killed thousands and thousands of innocents esp children.. Just for oil!
60 2018-08-31 23:55:06 Russia is taking over LNG and wants to trade on the petro yuan. China is the biggest importer of oil. You think they don't have a say. Frankly the country that backs the currency with gold is gonna win. Didn't work out to well for saddam.
61 2018-08-31 23:55:06 Look at Iraq. The intervention will leave you with all the old problems, except someone else is now taking the oil.

63 2018-08-31 23:55:00 I recommend peppermint essential oil. Just dab a little on your chest or on the back of your neck. Have a drink, too, but peppermint helps.
64 2018-08-31 23:54:56 They’re great people individually but they mix like oil and water
65 2018-08-31 23:54:54 Adulting is a pretty dumb thing to call doing shit you're supposed to when you're old, but damn do I feel proud to adult and get an oil change
66 2018-08-31 23:54:49 The people protesting against the oil and gas company and ridiculously ignorant. This shouldn’t even be a conversation. Either get oil from Saudi Arabia a country that kills gays and stones women? Or create our own oil. The answer seems clear cut to me.
67 2018-08-31 23:54:33 Please, tell that to all the people who died because of him and his wars. I have buried many brethren for oil in land not ours to fight so don’t give me that crap

69 2018-08-31 23:54:17 @realDonaldTrump Alberta premier is bawling loud about the nixing of the transmountain pipeline.  Get her a pipeline to US refiners, use of US to West Coast for export, or see what her gripe is about US oil pricing of Alberta oil.
70 2018-08-31 23:54:17 Valvoline stock too a dive a few years back when Al Sharpton quit using that 30 weight motor oil on his hair.  
71 2018-08-31 23:54:08 I reupped on my Egyptian musk oil ... that smell gets me EVERYTIME 
72 2018-08-31 23:53:53 The US supports 70% of the authoritarian regimes in the world but it loves the Venezuelan people. It's either that or perhaps the US is upset that it can't get its hands on Venezuela's oil and is using sanctions and the CIA to subvert their economy and overthrow the government.
73 2018-08-31 23:53:42 lol been driving w no oil cap because I forgot to put it back on when I poured more oil in  #dumbass
74 2018-08-31 23:53:26 Not only did my roommates use my hairbrush, but they didn't put it back and left it COVERED in coconut oil..... What the actual fuck
75 2018-08-31 23:53:12 The "Tories" made complete fools of themselves in the last couple of days. Mr. Scheer stated that the oil sands are some sort of environmental nirvana. Michelle Rempel thinks invoking the Notwithstanding Clause would be a thing. And it went downhill from there.

80 2018-08-31 23:52:04 I wish I break the system that is broadcasting the Underlying signals I can sort of see on the TV’s and any Screen with a picture, I had a detached retina and now have oil in Eye , so it picks out strange things only I see for sum reason, 
81 2018-08-31 23:52:02 I'll read it later. I know it's about oil currency. China is pushing petro yuan back by gold. Russia and Saudi said they would be on board. Just to be clear I know it not physical oil. But US wants to control its production.
82 2018-08-31 23:51:53 Fucking oil!
83 2018-08-31 23:51:49 I found a vitamin e oil from tjmaxx and it helped my skin so much
84 2018-08-31 23:51:42 spent the afternoon working at an oil change and I gotta say, sometimes it’s nice to go home with some dirt under your nails.
85 2018-08-31 23:51:19 Yes they won by allowing oil to be shipped by rail, which is much worse for the enviroment if there are spills.

They also won by continuing to allow eastern canada (where First Nations people also live) to stay reliant on Saudi oil. 

What a victory

92 2018-08-31 23:50:38 Your base includes oil workers that know that comparing crude bitumen to pretty much any other source of crude is a complete lark. Stop embarrassing yourself.
93 2018-08-31 23:50:37 My mom just informed me she used to work at the Wienerschnitzel until she tripped carrying ice and it fell into the deep fryer with hot oil and she caught the place on fire. An icon.

95 2018-08-31 23:50:09 They need the distraction.  Venezuela is an easy target: close, weak, has oil... makes perfect sense.  And if they invade prior to the midterms, it's GOP all the way!  Bet on it.
96 2018-08-31 23:50:03 I mean was China NOT AAPL's biggest future growth engine? Wasn't Pres. Trump supposed to favor Oil/GAS/Infrastructure stocks and shun tech? Now Timmy and Trump are Brohiems and China trade issues DON'T worry AAPL investors ...Yet MOVIE STOCKS SELL OFF?

98 2018-08-31 23:49:40 CIA agents demanded that the oil of the eastern region be released from the United States as a condition for withdrawal from Syria. They do not get the house into the people's countries. The refugees are dying every day. America and the West are very evil.

109 2018-08-31 23:48:01 Sorry Ida, I’m sure you learned your lesson of trusting a liar, that got caught with the Hollywood Access, then changed his story several times. Remember this are snake oil salesmen, who want your money.
110 2018-08-31 23:47:59 Indeed Al - you won! Now how are you going to help revitalize an oil based economy that millions of people relied on?

You sure have no problems interferring with other peoples business, so why not help with the stages after?

116 2018-08-31 23:47:43 Think back too the near past lol, trains of oil from the US burning down a whole town pipelines are safer because we now have two pipelines in one to contain the leaky main pipeline lol..Then the Chinese buy the tar sands Long Lake project  pipeline leaks 
117 2018-08-31 23:47:42 If you were honest Jason, you would know it was opec low oil prices that mostly caused the Venezuelan problems just like they did for Alberta but you are hungry for for power so you brainwash peoplewith BS. Alberta went through a recession because of opec but you blame NDP

126 2018-08-31 23:46:53 Yep. 3rd world country...horrible economy...no military.  “Oh crap they have oil?” Immediately picks up the red phone.    Everyone needs a ‘little’ war when things aren’t going well politically. Time to ‘Wag the dog’

136 2018-08-31 23:45:12 Except, as Canadians we grade our domestic energy differently. We expect improving carbon intensity, commitment to reducing environmental effects, supports for local and indigenous communities,  and western ethical standards. Foreign oil, not so much...
137 2018-08-31 23:45:10 Dinosaur bones were planted by the devil to receive us....about what only the gods know..Even the millions of years it takes to make oil, diamonds gem stones etc escapes the logic of science for for church of the golden calf

Yeah, I forgot Monday was Labor Day.

151 2018-08-31 23:43:30 Utter crap Chris. No more Oil and gas OFFSHORE EXPLORATION PERMITS (to correct your misrepresentation) is a responsible and forward looking action, at least if you care aboutclimate change.
152 2018-08-31 23:43:21 im sorry to be the party pooper but sphynx cats are usually worse for allergies than furry cats cause the allergy is to cat saliva and oil not the hair :(((
153 2018-08-31 23:43:14 In the interior where it's colder a lot of people burn wood, the air quality gets bad, but again no carbon tax, automotive businesses burn used engine oil for heat, again no carbon tax etc. If we had no hydro-electric dams and climate like the prairies, we'd be flat broke!
154 2018-08-31 23:43:13 You gotta get those heels and some baby oil and go out and stunt this weekend..

158 2018-08-31 23:43:02 I'm of the belief that changing the "Personnel" department to the "Human Resources" department started the fall of the worker. 

Employees aren't resources. That's oil, wood, steel, stuff like that.

Corporations dehumanize us every chance they get.
159 2018-08-31 23:42:59 He put his children in oil. Nothing's sinking in except his loss of freedom.
160 2018-08-31 23:42:53 It’s not about physical oil. 

It’s about OIL CURRENCY. Which just happens to be the world reserve currency. Which just happens to be  the U.S. Dollar
161 2018-08-31 23:42:38 Almost weekly, in fact.  Both cities suffered during Urban Renewal & the 80's oil bust, but Tulsa pretended it didn't tear down half it's downtown and have just as much mallsprawl.  But Tulsa does have one thing going for it - It'll always be known for it's race riot
162 2018-08-31 23:42:37 I mentioned to my dad I needed an oil change he was like I got u n I was like it’s cool n he was like no I never help you with stuff let me help u. I’m like cool. We had said Monday he has made an excuse everyday n today it’s bc he already showered I can’t stand this guy

Ohhhh... Venezuela has oil.
165 2018-08-31 23:42:18 Flint has this issue because of oil pipelines the gov tried or installed there, please educate yourselves before speaking on something serious.
166 2018-08-31 23:41:56 You just can't stop with the lies, can you? The federal government has $4.5 billion pipeline that's producing revenue, and lots of it. Now, I wish we weren't in the dirty oil business, but to call it a failure is flat out lying.
167 2018-08-31 23:41:35 We used peppermint essential oil on cotton wool pads to prevent mice getting into our garden centre canteen. Just inside the holes. It worked.

177 2018-08-31 23:40:29 Leave the oil companies to build it. We just wasted $billions on a guaranteed losing investment.

180 2018-08-31 23:40:07 Once I stop relying on my essential oil diffusers to fix all my problems it’s over for you hoes
181 2018-08-31 23:40:04 Anyone ever ate or smoked something with CBD oil? Here’s my theory on it.
182 2018-08-31 23:39:50 This will be in a museum someday.
183 2018-08-31 23:39:49 The oil companies and the banks are lobbying this as well as the arms companies. No humanitarian would say replace Maduro with a less stable conflict borne government. If that was the case Brazil would invade to keep migrants out and safe in their own nation.
184 2018-08-31 23:39:42 Your investments are minimal
Would be no long term damage
Canada has more resources than just oil
185 2018-08-31 23:39:38 There are a few of you, to be sure. But, there's no province that whines more about being a part of Canada than Alberta. I know I've lived and worked there. Guess who Albertans will come calling on when the oil sands stop producing and the cleanup begins?
186 2018-08-31 23:39:31 Grill salmon, baked sweet potato, and broccoli crowns rubbed in olive oil baked in the oven.
187 2018-08-31 23:39:02 Lol don’t be deceived, coconut oil isn’t that great.
188 2018-08-31 23:38:55 Don't be surprised if she sends some of her oil boys to burn BC to the ground
189 2018-08-31 23:38:47 If Alberta secedes, I guess British Columbia will be absorbed by Washington state, but remember that half or more of British columbians support Alberta oil and pipelines.
190 2018-08-31 23:38:46 Casor Oil? I know you’ve probably read stories but it does the strick lol
191 2018-08-31 23:38:44 most full fats you can get your hands on friend. it’s pretty much just oil and eggs, so it’s not just keto friendly; being that it’s mostly oil and eggs, with 90% of the fat being unsaturated, it’s a staple.
192 2018-08-31 23:38:36 See pls allow him pray to God to bless him and pray for ur self also may almighty God uplift u beyond ur imagination. Al fingers are not equal
193 2018-08-31 23:38:28 A bunch of oil splashed on my face and chest and I'm taking my thirty 36 minutes before I'm off 
FUUUUUUCK this place
194 2018-08-31 23:38:15 There are always 2 sides of a story to consider. I can't help but feel for struggling families who relied on jobs in the oil industry. Other countries will provide what Canada can’t and the outcome on the environment will still be the same, sadly #TransMountainPipeline

202 2018-08-31 23:37:23 But that is 100% incorrect. It sinks as soon as it comes in contact with any sediment in the water (which the ocean is full of). The only study done determined (indoors with clear fresh water) that dilbit does not behave as other oil products and then they stopped the research
203 2018-08-31 23:37:22 Absolutely zero US interest other than for the two glaring reasons US wars started for the past 4 decades. Oil and vulture capitalism ... maybe arms sale but that predates the 4 decade threshold and might be the original sin so it's a given in every US war to "liberate" a nation.
204 2018-08-31 23:37:19 @rhian_hy Catching up on your videos, just watched the supplement one, and wondering if you've tried Ritual? I switched out everything else for it, it has D3, B12, Iron, Magnesium, and Omega 3's from algae oil, it's vegan, really cute, and mint flavored.
205 2018-08-31 23:37:00 Which country’s is he bombing for oil????? Or is that ok cause he is cool and danced on Ellen’s shoe

208 2018-08-31 23:36:42 We have to save all those poor, starving people from all that oil!
209 2018-08-31 23:36:41 Really? Once again historic revisionism rears it's ugly head! As a Canadian  with 1 set of American grandparents & a husband who owes his career in the oil industry to the University of Wyoming, I and many other Canadians are truly thankful for American ingenuity. 
Neighbors!
210 2018-08-31 23:36:36 I need to go get a oil change 
211 2018-08-31 23:36:35 Because that’s totalitarian and sexist af? Are you simple? Women earn less because they make different choices and work less hours mate. Nobody is going to work on an oil rig for a low wage.
212 2018-08-31 23:36:28 @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Expediting a China deal and maintaining the Iraq strategy w/China buying half of their oil , this could get the bush people behind you in the DOJ. If you do the right thing with Iraq, the bush people could support you then.

217 2018-08-31 23:36:09 I wish to provide some clarity to your post.  The single largest shareholder of Canadian National Railways is …. Bill Gates who owns 13% outright.  Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway owns BNSF Railway.  Two filthy rich guys, owning railways, moving oil.  Rich get richer.
218 2018-08-31 23:35:46 Venezuela has oil. See a pattern here?
219 2018-08-31 23:35:43 Have you ever tried CBD oil to help w that

232 2018-08-31 23:33:20 Self-proclamation is the oil in the waters of legitimacy.
233 2018-08-31 23:33:18 Yes let's sacrifice thousands of auto workers jobs in Ontario for the dairy cartel in Quebec. Plus, now that Trans Mountain is all but dead you can kill the oil industry in Alberta too. Hell of a week for Trudeau I must say. But ya, stand strong Canada. Idiot!

240 2018-08-31 23:32:48 There is a difference between being "against" oil and openly asking why we have to continue to kneel to an industry that pollutes, causes violence and sows division among us. Why can't we progress beyond it?
241 2018-08-31 23:32:43 Alam ko, pero di ako nagtitiwala, Internet is the superhighway of infos but some infos are not reliable, katulad ng infos tunkol sa politics

244 2018-08-31 23:32:22 but question is what are we trying to achieve with all the oil n gas n consumption? where is the end of it? Can someone tell this is the goal of all that progress? we are following shadow of progress which has no end. we wiil keep consuming until nothing is left

Rendering facilities?
249 2018-08-31 23:31:24 As usual, #Scheer is stabbing Canada & the oil industry in the back.

First, this is a LIE. The #NEB ruling was based on criteria set up by #Harper, not #Trudeau.

The courts have delayed this precisely because Harper tried to narrow the focus of the NEB review.

250 2018-08-31 23:31:20 What reconomy?  Green energy is not sufficient to replace coal or oil.  Nothing is unless you have a zero point energy source in your pocket?
251 2018-08-31 23:31:10 Hmm. From what I'm reading online it's that people keep popping for trace amounts of thc in CBD oil or hemp seeds but CBD itself isn't bad. So I'll just have to ask the saco I guess

270 2018-08-31 23:27:55 @KarlRove @CondoleezzaRice with China getting half of Iraqi oil, they will be on our side against a nuclear Iran probably. This helps limit the threat of a nuclear Iran and creates equilibrium and hedges off radicalism in the region.
271 2018-08-31 23:27:50 the only problem with this oil is it has a mint flavor and mind is my mortal enemy… and because it's oil it won't dissolve unless there's a high fat content in the drink you put it in and humans have decided fat is Bad so hgkghgkhhhfkkk the things I do for pain relief

278 2018-08-31 23:27:17 They are not 'tar' sands.  They are oil sands.  
More to Alberta oil production than that, but it requires drilling. 
Pipelines are the safest and most efficient way to get oil to market.  
The alternative is rail. 
More to Alberta than oil, but transport of goods requires energy

Too good to be true!
You can lick it off afterwards and has such a taste! It smells like strawberry, bubble gum, cotton candy! It moisturizes your lips with organic jojoba oil! I LITTERALLY love it I think you will too.

This blue shampoo made from Irish moss and seaweed, lemon oil and flower oils is one of my favorite! It makes you smell HEAVENLY! It detangles hair leaving it soooo soft. The lemon makes the hair have a healthy shine while the flower oil perfume.

287 2018-08-31 23:26:45 Biggest benefit that I see is in building it in home waters where logistics are not such an issue. 
I could be totally off base but I see this sort of like how they build oil rigs more than some novel floating reactor. Build onshore, barge to location, fix in place.

292 2018-08-31 23:25:24 I bought a diffuser and sprayed lavender and peppermint oil in my walls and floors. I’m not playing the spiders this year.
293 2018-08-31 23:25:19 Anyone who pays any attention to Lee Camp or Abby Martin is well aware this is on the way. It'a been coming since Chavez nationalized the oil fields. The CIA has been taking down their news infrastructure all month. The situation there is entirely of our own making.
294 2018-08-31 23:25:17 Why South America? It can't be the oil, can it?
295 2018-08-31 23:25:15 Oil!
296 2018-08-31 23:25:11 I spent $89 on art supplies for one project for my oil painting class...rip
297 2018-08-31 23:25:04 Oil
298 2018-08-31 23:24:58 1) Only 8 countries in the world have added more carbon to the atmosphere then Canada has. 2) Canadians are the 2nd highest per capita emitters in the world. 3) TMX has nothing to do with where our oil comes from, it’s for export. 4) Oil demand will decline in our generation.
299 2018-08-31 23:24:56 We are sitting on a gold mine asides the oil we have but we keep voting in lifeless individuals who are to blind to see beyond technology and innovations , people who should have been extinct, archived and should be a piece of history’s for the unborn generations at the museums.

301 2018-08-31 23:24:29 I've been saying it for months. It over oil don't let them tell you different. All the OPEC countries we have a problem or war with. Iran Iraq Libya Ecuador now Venezuela. Trump ask Saudi to make the difference and they got weapons.
302 2018-08-31 23:24:26 For oil?
303 2018-08-31 23:24:19 Is there a story that goes with this? As they say in the oil industry, don’t tight hole us.
304 2018-08-31 23:24:04 Tonight’s #Keto dinner dish was a win, even with our toddler ! Seasoned chicken thighs with fresh green beans, sautéed in coconut oil and fresh garlic!
305 2018-08-31 23:24:00 I would go all the way to contacting the owner’s family members lmao he can get yelled at by his grandma to fix my oil lol
306 2018-08-31 23:23:59 Just kidding, but she wanted to stay in the car.  My wife went there to get some CBD oil

Christian Cole is dominating, once again
308 2018-08-31 23:23:44 There is fishing in petroleum engineering- during drilling operations and also at the surface, Christmas tree is use during production of crude oil, act as BOP and has varying design factors. Did you know all of these before?
309 2018-08-31 23:23:41 Time to move. The oil burner is from the '50s. I won't make it thru another. Escape time!
310 2018-08-31 23:23:36 of course.Venezuela has oil!
311 2018-08-31 23:22:58 Digitally manipulating past Alaskan oil securities,what would equivalent ww2 depth charges do staged to California in Alaskan pipe line?
312 2018-08-31 23:22:44 ugh - can you imagine him trying to run a giant oil company? thered be an exon valdez in every bay. :)
313 2018-08-31 23:22:20 The capitalists deceive us into believing that they have rights to land, oil and other concessions.
314 2018-08-31 23:22:08 i placed an order for some oil a whole hour &a half ago yet im still waiting. smfh
315 2018-08-31 23:21:59 For sure, they are as split as the rest of the country on these projects. Oil is a very divisive topic.
316 2018-08-31 23:21:45 It was  Mustard oil that used a revolver to break the flashlight
317 2018-08-31 23:21:28 Yes, halting the Notley/Trudeau Pipeline is a victory, achieved despite the treachery of neoliberal environmentalists who typically support Big Oil’s carbon-pricing powers. See also the COP23 released report of the Indigenous Environmental Network: No to Carbon-Pricing!
318 2018-08-31 23:21:22 He can’t pay for all his promises without Alberta Oil $.
319 2018-08-31 23:21:07 One word about why: oil.
320 2018-08-31 23:21:03 In 2013 it was said the World had 53 yrs of Oil reserves left, the Saudis control a fifth of that. Are we seeing what constitutes an appeasement program in which future Oil is dependent on the West accepting Islam? Is that why governments are not listening to the people? Hmm!
321 2018-08-31 23:21:02 I’ll have you know that I actually have changed the oil on a car before so

326 2018-08-31 23:20:38 the only feminist lie is that i've been human this whole time you motherfuckers. more women in big oil
327 2018-08-31 23:20:32 Idk about that...to hard to maintain standards. States w big industry, oil,coal etc...wd pollute & ya know...water runs downstream. It effects everyone. There’s no realistic way to re-make the Fed Gov as small as you’d like.
328 2018-08-31 23:20:30 Oil supply?
329 2018-08-31 23:20:21 "Ms. Oge recalled a public hearing that included the mother of a child with severe asthma sitting next to oil executive. The proposal in question was to reduce sulfur in diesel oil, a measure designed to prevent respiratory and other illnesses, especially asthma in children ..."
330 2018-08-31 23:20:04 Not only that our Canadian tax dollars are being used for massive oil expansion in the USA.
331 2018-08-31 23:20:03 i need cbd oil. 
Idk where to look for
332 2018-08-31 23:20:03 Let's see, Venezuela has oil, just like Iraq. But they won't invade for oil. No, they said they didn't invade Iraq for oil. They were "freeing" the Iraqis. So we need to "free" the oil-rich Venezuelans now, too. All this freedom and flags and walls.
333 2018-08-31 23:20:01 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
334 2018-08-31 23:19:25 Honey, you did that. You have so much oil !!!!
335 2018-08-31 23:19:20 I am trying to make sure I oil my gun at the right places. I know glizzy owners are dumb but every instruction online starts off with “MAKE SURE YOUR GUN IS UNLOADED”
336 2018-08-31 23:19:18 引火したら、もう手遅れさ…
337 2018-08-31 23:19:13 How much of this is driven by interests tied to Venezuelan oil? Seems "follow the oil" is sound advice to those researching motives for US foreign policy.
338 2018-08-31 23:19:11 You can really tell the difference driving after getting your oil changed and it being 6,000 miles over 
339 2018-08-31 23:18:35 All the oil is in Venezuela..
340 2018-08-31 23:18:24 Newf?  Really?  Newfoundland only developed some? Are you for real? Newfoundland has 3 major offshore oil platforms.

342 2018-08-31 23:18:06 Coconut oil pulling makes my mouth feel so sleek and silky.
343 2018-08-31 23:18:05 You might start thinking oil too my friend. Any idea how much of that stuff Canada ships south? I think it is 40% of US imports.

You will notice no talk of US tariffs on that.
344 2018-08-31 23:18:05 Aww.<3 Com'on. You and the others provided much more assets and good ideas to this. Using the clothing component for the wires and my floating script for reflecting oil and dirt on the water was such a cool idea. Wish we could've way more time for it.
345 2018-08-31 23:17:51 Fuck the pipeline. Take the 10M deal and start investing away from oil.
346 2018-08-31 23:17:43 Oooh yeah I know how much you like the oil paintings  can’t wait to see it

352 2018-08-31 23:17:15 Hopefully it doesn't leak in your backyard. Thinking it needs a triple jacket of Pittsburgh steel. I heard that Alberta oil sand can wear out pipes in no time before becoming Texas Tea blended. Around here we haven't heard a war since 1812 keeping Russia out of better trade talks
353 2018-08-31 23:17:14 There's oil there.... alot of oil. so why are you surprised?
354 2018-08-31 23:17:05 I’m never getting this oil change done mi and Bety were “chismeando de la puteria” for two hours

356 2018-08-31 23:16:58 The pipeline is still putting oil on the coast. It is producing a profit stream. it is the same profit stream that has been in place for decades.
357 2018-08-31 23:16:38 Kansas: gas/oil reserves Big $!
Minnesota: two refineries(mostly Canadian crude)/zero reserves.

All you’ve got is excuses.
358 2018-08-31 23:16:36 She has CBD oil.  She is the Captain of Essex County’s Prosecutor’s equivalent of SVU. So she refuses to take it.

360 2018-08-31 23:16:02 He is excitable but I can be as well. I think you are right. He does want me to excuse the oil industry for their arrogant use of water and resources w/o respect for poor citizens like Jessica Ernst who is being royally screwed by the system. I don't see why I should excuse them.
361 2018-08-31 23:15:48 my brows has gotten so thick and full after only 3 weeks of castor oil use omg
362 2018-08-31 23:15:34 This is very deep and is a mystery. In any case who are we to do otherwise. Because when we were yet sinners Christ died for us. May God strengthen us all even as He blesses and cause your oil to overflow.
363 2018-08-31 23:15:28 not many people know, but i'm actually just a disgusting churning industrial process that spills pollution everywhere and attracts cockroaches and small rodents. i have been making oil for decades and you fools hadn't noticed
364 2018-08-31 23:15:20 I have TERRIBLE hormonal acne, and the Oil of Olay pore scrub made a HUGE difference on my skin. BUT I also use a prescribed topical cream and the Night Bright duo from Drunk Elephant...It's a bit pricey, but it is the best thing I've ever used.

370 2018-08-31 23:15:04 Yeah Canada might attack us or cut off our oil supply.

372 2018-08-31 23:14:59 Hmmm...who gets the oil
373 2018-08-31 23:14:58 Here comes Eryk, a chaotic neutral Rock Gnome Cleric with a war pick and a flask of oil.

375 2018-08-31 23:14:39 Strange is that in Bakersfield he quit preaching and drive a truck.  Guess Nazarenes didn’t cotton to his teen girl banging.  The town was Basque sheep people and oil field workers and agriculture.  He could have hid there.
376 2018-08-31 23:14:35 You can have all the oil in the world... I'll take the water.
377 2018-08-31 23:14:29 Don't think all the oil producing provinces will forget either!

384 2018-08-31 23:13:42 More oil use means more global warming, which means all season ports! The problem solves itself.
385 2018-08-31 23:13:39 Thanks. Whipped Vegetable Oil is definitely not "Ultimate Indulgence".
386 2018-08-31 23:13:36 You're a clown Lisa.

Why do you choose war and oil over peace and a green new deal?
387 2018-08-31 23:13:26 めびにょ☆さんがかわいくなっている。
388 2018-08-31 23:13:07 If you use Monat or SeneGence products they both have a great all purpose oil that fixes everything including scars, stretch marks, sunburns and rashes!
389 2018-08-31 23:13:03 Better make sure those instruments work! Oil the valves, add the cork grease, clean the mouthpieces, wipe down the @vicfirth drumsticks and get ready! #TheBandIsBack
390 2018-08-31 23:13:00 So I’m at the dealership getting an oil change and this lady who’s also getting work done on her car left a box of 3 day old kittens in her car and told the service team she didn’t want them. I really can’t stand people sometimes
391 2018-08-31 23:12:58 I even make a North African type flatbread from (now spelt not wheat) semolina and olive oil.
392 2018-08-31 23:12:56 My senator, the human oil spill @tedcruz has no spine. He’s been on the run from constituents since 2016. We are all-in for @BetoORourke ! #Beto2018 #BetoDaysAreComing #BetoForSenate
393 2018-08-31 23:12:56 If "ethical oil" rhetoric was the key to Alberta's long-term economic stability, we wouldn't still be arguing over pipelines right now

395 2018-08-31 23:12:54 Good luck tonight Rico! 
396 2018-08-31 23:12:42 So sweet. Love it!
397 2018-08-31 23:12:40 Yet the article has no mention of all the American oil companies that stand to lose billions in potential Revenue as being major donors to the tides Foundation. The list of Tides Foundation donors is easily found online with a Google search.
398 2018-08-31 23:12:30 Our staunchest allies are buying all their oil from Russia..Look at the deal Germany made..
399 2018-08-31 23:12:22 Black seed oil ey? We deyyyt
400 2018-08-31 23:11:36 Your party couldn't build them while in power. So the whole time you where at the helm, we sold discounted oil to the US, and yet, you did nothing....and now you are outraged!!!  You couldn't build our own!
401 2018-08-31 23:11:32 If they're so adamant about their convictions, tell them to take a 20% standard of living cut and then come back and talk to us about how toxic and harmful the oil sands are.
402 2018-08-31 23:11:07 It is genuinely unfathomable that @RachelNotley would look dead into the camera and calmly announce that Alberta is pulling out of the national climate change plan, holding it hostage until we can be allowed to have an oil pipeline.

And yet I just watched it happen.
403 2018-08-31 23:10:46 Can’t help but think how the mid-East would completely lose its importance if the West could break its oil addiction. All the technology to do so is already here.
404 2018-08-31 23:10:43 Thank You and I hope you have a great N.Y.  weekend too.

411 2018-08-31 23:10:06 James 5:14 Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
412 2018-08-31 23:09:54 90% of u niggas couldn’t do an oil change on ur own car  nuff said
413 2018-08-31 23:09:40 Need better service in rural areas. ATT and Version our kicking your ass in the oil patches of South Texas,and West Texas/New Mexico.
414 2018-08-31 23:09:30 See, that’s why I can’t have my own consistent masseuse. I’d get comfortable, and start asking for extras. 

What’s your Netflix password?

Is that the good wine?

Is that massage oil infused with CBD?
415 2018-08-31 23:09:21 The Houston Rockets are a pair of clown shoes. James Harden gets more gassed than the Germans in the battle of Stalingrad. Lack of oil crippled the Germans and the Rockets!
416 2018-08-31 23:09:11 in an optimistic scenario only about a third of the O&G jobs lost during the oil crash in 2014 would come back because of automation, etc. 

Also because of Klein the province to this day fails to collect even its small share of royalties.  #ableg

419 2018-08-31 23:08:48 Oil it down l. That’s all the way retarded.
420 2018-08-31 23:08:48 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
421 2018-08-31 23:08:48 I see you’re from the US on your twitter profile...if you’re so damn worried about so called climate change why don’t you have a look at what Trump is doing for the oil and gas industry in the states. #dingaling
422 2018-08-31 23:08:32 It’s a fact that states couldn’t pay salaries anymore before PMB n some firms were already cutting staff salaries. It’s also a fact that Nigeria slipped into recession due to global oil price falling drastically and as at that time Nigeria had nothing as a shock absorber.
423 2018-08-31 23:08:06 I took it he meant all college football players are gamecocks, and not an affront to Carolina. Marcus is one of the lucky few among millions of oil drums full of NCAA athletes. But let’s not pretend we wouldn’t have dumped him if he wasn’t charismatic and marketable.

426 2018-08-31 23:07:56 I agree. There are some cases that CBD oil does help with seizures in some people. The problem is that going to Dr's is expensive & a pain in the butt. Much easier to get CBD oil. If u have seizures & it helps, go for it.
427 2018-08-31 23:07:32 I used to be in love with Neve Campbell. 
So I’m watching scream 2 to renew my infatuation with her.
428 2018-08-31 23:07:31 I just need all the creams, all the tablets, and all the tea tree oil in the world and *maybe* it’ll get better 
429 2018-08-31 23:06:58 Yeah, but you don't believe climate change is a problem apparently and don't see the link with warming seas increasing the chance of this happening. Hypocrite. Keep supposing oil companies. You're cooking and dooming our planet.
430 2018-08-31 23:06:45 What the anti-kinder-morgan pipeline folks don't see, is by opposing the pipeline, that won't stop the oil from being extracted. It just means a more error prone form of transport will be used -- trucks and trains. See how often leaks are tied to those forms. It'll surprise you
431 2018-08-31 23:06:44 Haha! Suck my battery Ford Nation! 

...also - just a reminder that this is NOT a rebate just for expensive Teslas, its for ANY electric car, including much cheaper ones.

And while we're here - lets not forget about the $3.3 BILLION dollar subsidies given to oil companies.
432 2018-08-31 23:06:39 BIG OIL almost won there. Actually they did but Tesla have to fight hard for it
433 2018-08-31 23:06:27 You want the Oil, you want the gold, you want all the mineral resources, but you don't want the migrants, how ridiculous is that.

435 2018-08-31 23:06:10 Albertans need to stop whining about how the world is against them when they already have one of the strongest economies in the world. Stop with the victim complex. Get your house in order and stop relying on oil booms to make your province work. Grew up there. Do better.
436 2018-08-31 23:06:05 I'll be DEAD and BURIED before we pay off this pipeline that PM slyly purchased while the oil companies didn't even want it.  Maybe after my post-death resurrection things might be a bit more better managed???
437 2018-08-31 23:05:54 Oil is teetering on the edge of collapsing. The only reason its not $10 a barrel today is because Saudi Arabia agreed to cut production. Well electric autos are taking over as fast as smart phones took over flip phones. The oil collapse will come hard and unexpected. Ur not rdy
438 2018-08-31 23:05:40 Want some castor oil? Lol
439 2018-08-31 23:05:39 I took my first oil painting workshop! I’ve done lots of drawing and watercolor but never picked up oil paints. It was FANTASTIC.
440 2018-08-31 23:05:35 They tried that. Libya and Iran wanted to use Euro instead of US  dollar for the price of a barrel of oil.....what happened to those leaders. #weaponsofmassdistruction

443 2018-08-31 23:05:23 My favorite is when this happens as the oil change guy turns on my car to drive it into the bay and my Bluetooth connects and resumes the black metal I had on.
444 2018-08-31 23:05:14 Death by palm oil. It's been nice knowing you.
445 2018-08-31 23:05:11 In 1951, Iran and the ME had its first democracy under Mohammed Mossadeq. He nationalised the Anglo-Iranian oil company to benefit thr people. In 1953 he was assassinated by CIA & MI6 who replaced him with the Shah (dictator). His oppressiveness led to Islamic revolution of 1979
446 2018-08-31 23:05:05 #DidYouKnow  J. M. W. Turner depicted the fishermen of #Shoeburyness in his oil painting Shoeburyness Fishermen Hailing a Whitstable Hoy.
447 2018-08-31 23:04:35 Trying walking, or squats., spicy foods. Do not try castor oil lol I did with Addie & all it did was make me sick
448 2018-08-31 23:04:20 @albertaNDP @RachelNotley 's pro-carbon tax agenda & anti-Trans Mountain ruling blowing up the pipeline shows utter folly of placating eco-terrorists whose only aim is to make sure Canada remains dependent on oil from petro-terrorist states of Middle East like @SaudiEmbassyUSA

451 2018-08-31 23:03:50 I guess you prefer filling Canada with imported oil from Saudi Arabia? I prefer conflict free CANADIAN oil, but I'm weird like that 
452 2018-08-31 23:03:43 U.S.:*notices your oil reserves* OwO what’s this??
453 2018-08-31 23:03:38 Robyn, paging Robyn, Please pick up a white courtesy telephone. I think Alex’s point re Canadian Oil being “ ethical” vs Saudi et al, deserves a rebuttal...if its even possible.
454 2018-08-31 23:03:32 Now we get Energy East back on track with gov assistance so we can refine our own oil and end reliance on Saudi oil shipped through the Gulf of St L.
455 2018-08-31 23:03:26 Wtf, dude just use fucking oil and cook it medium heat. Thats all

458 2018-08-31 23:02:59 I got my car fixed, oil change, and windshield replaced this week. My car is a new BITCH ok
459 2018-08-31 23:02:56 Because maybe there’s not the same risk of an accident that results in 100,000s of litres of oil spilling into the ocean? 
460 2018-08-31 23:02:48 Severely underrated snack. One of our restaurants is a Spanish themed tapas bar and we do these marinated olives with rosemary, olive oil, garlic, and orange/lemon zest. THEY ARE CRACK.
461 2018-08-31 23:02:37 Aww no! It may have been the wrong one, you may need a different antibiotic cream hopefully the tea tree oil will help, save you going on antibiotic tablets!
462 2018-08-31 23:02:34 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
463 2018-08-31 23:02:20 Awh. If it still aches try some peppermint oil and put it on it. It's like a natural icy hot

467 2018-08-31 23:01:27 I just had a brain tumor removed. Took  some kind of opioid for a few days. Scared to death of becoming hooked. I am now taking cannibas oil instead. Thanks for sharing.
468 2018-08-31 23:01:22 i accidentally got my oil cleanser in my eyes and now theyre just permanently watery i guess
469 2018-08-31 23:00:59 Someday I want to buy an oil immersion microscope for home use. I miss the access I used to have in the lab. It was really fascinating to monitor microbial perturbations around lower respiratory infections. :)

478 2018-08-31 22:59:36 That's their usual way. First time I went to sell palm oil at Onitsha, some women wasted 4hrs of my time dipping fingers into my palm oil and tasting. They now priced me a ridiculous amount claiming no one would buy if I didn't sell to them. Told them thank you 1/2
479 2018-08-31 22:59:33 ... Added a $5 thing of pastel pink oil paint to my order of stuff for art class because why not, I was on the site...

484 2018-08-31 22:58:47 Canada will be up Shits Creek so fast your head will spin. US doesn't need Canadian goods. We have enough oil domestically and from other countries abroad. Canada needs US money terribly. Your economy is based on moving goods through America. An entry tarriff will fix that.
485 2018-08-31 22:58:46 OK. Venezuela is a personality-cult dictatorship built on oil revenues. Gee, what could go wrong? And your 1931 definition of "socialism" is a out of date. Today's American socialism: cheap/free ed., universal health care, decent safety net -- pretty close to Eisenhower GOP.
486 2018-08-31 22:58:45 The way things are going with this administration, until Gov. Brown signs SB100 and other states do the same, it would be hypocritical with AB813 to be in a regional grid. Coal from MT & WY, gas&oil from public lands, nuclear from AZ,...

488 2018-08-31 22:58:30 Yes. International studies have been conducted which conclude that Canada ranks # 1 in preferred choice of energy source. Basic supply and demand tells us that if the global demand shifts to CDN oil, other producers will have to decrease production due to market loss ($ loss)
489 2018-08-31 22:58:14 Free or inexpensive energy sources is the future. Because coal is instinct and oil the past

493 2018-08-31 22:57:45 Education Minister, do u really believe oil is the most environmentally friendly energy source? Not solar, wind, but petroleum? I don't think you have the basic knowledge to lead the ministry of education.

495 2018-08-31 22:57:39 Here the Oakville Ford plant has been getting top quality awards putting the pieces together since I was born. Looks like I'll have to buy a plastic shovel from China at Walmart rather than no Pittsburgh steel shovel choices. Middle East oil better than Canadian Oil now?
496 2018-08-31 22:57:33 Iraq is the 5th largest country in oil reserves. Iraq geopolitically was a force opposed to Israel, and rivaled Saudi Arabia in some regard (both allies to the U.S.) Saddam seeked to weaken the strength of the petrodollar by selling in euros, which the U.S. could not allow.

500 2018-08-31 22:56:47 It's clear #Trump is jealous of Trudeau and Canada. He doesn't like that another country can be great, and a leader respected. I hope Trudeau / Freeland pull out of NAFTA and turn toward Asia/Europe for trade. NO OIL for #Trump.
501 2018-08-31 22:56:44 I figured, since that's standard with flies. Since I'm planning on mainly working with embryos, I'm not going to worry about it.

Now if anyone knows an inexpensive source for halocarbon oil…
502 2018-08-31 22:56:41 No problem! I recommend the night serum and Marula oil!

506 2018-08-31 22:55:57 @kenjilopezalt I made your Detroit pizza a few weeks ago (fantastic) and now today I'm making it again, but have you changed the recipe? I know this sounds crazy, but I'm remembering there was olive oil in the dough last time I made it.
507 2018-08-31 22:55:47 Pre-NCAAF Season kick off dinner:  butcher cut bone-in ribeye, twice baked potato, stir fried broccoliw/garlic  and 18 yr. aged olive oil.  Sshhh...don’t answer the door when adult daughter unexpectedly drops by 
508 2018-08-31 22:55:37 It’s something about this one particular oil I be wearing
509 2018-08-31 22:55:31 I agree and am somewhat the same way, but when you go out in search of spiritual things, people will often try to sell you on snake oil.
510 2018-08-31 22:55:21 Ladies, if no one told you today.. check that oil change sticker and make sure you don’t need one
511 2018-08-31 22:55:18 Your body anointed with oil - heaven
512 2018-08-31 22:55:10 Bought a oil diffuser and honestly why didn’t I buy one earlier!
513 2018-08-31 22:55:07 Drink water, 
Fruits. vegetables . Eat at least 2 fruits a day. Green, leafy  veggies are the best (kale, cabbage, broccoli)
Dairy is fine, just don't overdo it. 
Use more oil than butter. 
Eat more lean meats(less fatty meats) e.g fish, chicken breast, Turkey breast, pork.

518 2018-08-31 22:54:35 There is always a way to make money off helping companies developing new technologies. It just takes one influencial person, group or party to create that pathway.

Oil is old tech that harms us and our natural environment. Call me what you will. I think there is more here.
519 2018-08-31 22:54:27 I usually go with licorice, clove oil, or rinse with liquid benadryl. This nose spray I used to use for my allergies would give me those really bad. the benadryl thing I got from a thing called magic mouthwash.

521 2018-08-31 22:53:57 There are no good or bad. It's all bad. If we were supported by the oil industry as advertised, we would have all already to that degree. AB was given a 9B deficit, as I recall hearing.  In most cases, those items are not borne of the oil industry - that's strictly a sales pitch,

534 2018-08-31 22:51:55 This has a real effect on the status of the African countries’ economic success, removing their governments from any economic control, due to the loss of control over the oil.

537 2018-08-31 22:51:38 I don't use oil, I don't use Ac, and I have never flown lol. Kinda funny how that lined up. I'm not saying buy solar farms I'm saying why not invest in companies who can provide it cheaper. Governments can help provide incentives and help with infrastructure for businesses.
538 2018-08-31 22:51:32 annoyingly, I *remember* seeing the recipe for chik fil a chicken on tumblr forever ago, but I can't FIND it

553 2018-08-31 22:49:18 Yup. Destroy the oil industry. Go back to living naked off of our wits in the forest. There isn’t one item in your life that isn’t derived from or reliant on oil. 43% of a barrel is used to make fuels, the other 57% is used for textiles, fabrics and food.

565 2018-08-31 22:47:34 Really? It has nothing to do with their 25% drop in oil production between '99 and '13 because they replaced knowledgeable industry people with loyal people and stopped investing in refining tech as a result?

569 2018-08-31 22:46:57 Immigration policy, not being able to make our own trade agreements, and stopping me buying powerful hoovers. Not to mention paying for the privilege for them to sit around generating reams of paper on bent bananas and open olive oil bottles.

573 2018-08-31 22:46:34 I'm not built for a right hour funeral.
574 2018-08-31 22:46:26 I'm lucky to have family that brings organic olive oil. It has two stamps of authenticity. This time of year, when the tomatoes are just picked..., a little drizzle of OO + some basil... delicioso 
575 2018-08-31 22:46:20 We thats not entirely true. We provide power to most of the eastern coast and make cars for you and provide oil to your refineries.  So it's a bit of a equal partnership until Trump screws it up

579 2018-08-31 22:45:48 I've ate breakfast, washed, dried & folded clothes, rearranged my room, went to the car wash, got a tuneup & oil change, went to Walmart, cooked dinner, cut the grass, watched every season of Martin, and celebrated 2 birthdays...all while watching this Aretha funeral

581 2018-08-31 22:45:43 Last I heard most of the auto industry relies on  oil?
582 2018-08-31 22:45:39 Also from one of my favorite movie quotes ever. ;o) From Astro Boy:

"No darn dirty hippie's gonna sit in my Oval Office eating mung beans and stinking of patchouli oil."
583 2018-08-31 22:45:38 Well...Maybe the folks that served in any previous administration's EPA.

The current one might just make something pro sugar, pro coal, pro oil, pro pollution up.
584 2018-08-31 22:45:35 It’s definitely weird that some boy, that I do not know, messaged me saying he’d ‘love to rub baby oil over you’... like wot?! WHAT?! 
585 2018-08-31 22:45:34 Sending prayers your way

588 2018-08-31 22:44:45 What about the families that rely on oil
589 2018-08-31 22:44:44 “Western alienation” is a bumper sticker slogan that the oil lobbyists masquarading as a conservative party uses to convince rural voters that the Liberal Part is actively working against their interests. Its puppeteering at its finest.
590 2018-08-31 22:44:43 Level 4 actually.

607 2018-08-31 22:42:29 You are only fooling ignorants on Twitter. 
Look at performance of all currencies vis a vis $US. Oil trades in $US 
Unfortunately Modi don't control price of oil in world markets, neither can pappu n his team can do anything...so chill buddy.

615 2018-08-31 22:41:00 And now you can go stand in Front of the tanks and armored vehicles in Saudi Arabia to stop blood oil from entering Canada you courageous people you? Ya right!
616 2018-08-31 22:40:59 7)The Department of Interior, which has led the way in  cutting  regulations, opened plans to lease 77 million acres in the Gulf  of  Mexico for oil and gas drilling. Trump traveled the world to promote the sale and use of U.S. energy.

621 2018-08-31 22:40:12 Bill Peters coached both players in the NHL the last three and four seasons. That's direct. The guy that coached the Oil Kings talking to Chiarelli is less impactful than direct NHL experience that is recent. Kiprusoff with Sutter would be direct and a great example as well.

625 2018-08-31 22:39:36 Auntie gave me black castor oil, sugar cane, homemade grapefruit jelly & mangos from Haiti. She truly loves me.
626 2018-08-31 22:39:24 My car needs an oil change  It’s at 8%, should I wait until next weekend ?
627 2018-08-31 22:39:09 I knew i should have bought some damn castor oil when i seen it today 
628 2018-08-31 22:39:09 We ship 4X more oil on the E coast than the W coast. We drill for oil offshore E coast but not in the W coast. There are Orcas. Humpbacks, Right Whales, key fisheries and aboriginal people out east. There are species at risk there too. Such hypocrisy by your FDN.
629 2018-08-31 22:38:52 What kind of oil change did you get!?! 
630 2018-08-31 22:38:29 So..are u saying that oil palm plantation does not threaten out biodiversity in which it all comes from the idea that the western wants us to believe?
631 2018-08-31 22:38:29 Strategy of climate change hysterics: Gaia needs them. People need to start being brave to speak out against destruction of our economy. The word denier of global catastrophe if we develop oil and gas has to be stopped or Canada will be destroyed. The real danger is @gmbutts.

634 2018-08-31 22:37:51 THEN AGAIN.... there is the scripture that talks about the ten virgins, how 5 were wise and 5 were not, and how the not-wise virgins left before the wedding to get oil for their lamps, and when they got back they weren't allowed in. So I mean, if you go off that...

638 2018-08-31 22:37:13 No estoy exagerando, que expliquen como era el intercambio de gas y fuel oil con Venezuela, ahí no más hay cerca de 8 mil millones de dólares
639 2018-08-31 22:37:07 That's exactly what the @bbcmundo told me in 2002 when I protested what Hugo Chávez  was doing against 20000 oil workers @PDVSA @acgdelp in #Venezuela

641 2018-08-31 22:37:00 Guy, buhari just happen to inherit an economy that Was already on its way down. He couldn't have controled the global price of oil which was our main stay. We didn't have enuf saved for it & as such the shock was real. Yes he didn't help.matters with his slow approach then, but..
642 2018-08-31 22:36:52 I do not understand why w/ record flooding & several states w/o water we can't build water pipelines, when a city is going to flood, before it is flooded, the pipeline is opened & the water is sent to states like CA that need the water. We don't need oil pipelines need water ones
643 2018-08-31 22:36:50 Panamax Class tankers (the standard for oil shipments) don't fit in the Port of Vancouver. Kinder Morgan wanted to use an expanded fleet of Aframax tankers instead, increasing traffic & the risk of a spill.
644 2018-08-31 22:36:21 Yes CBD oil! Great idea. I’m all for using marijuana over big pharma #RHOC
645 2018-08-31 22:36:21 These people will say whatever it takes to stop ANY development. Forestry,Fishing,Water exports,LNG,Oil,Gas it doesn't matter to them. Most are a burden on the system and are jealous of individual  prosperity. Grew up on Van Island. Know what badly scares whales?

654 2018-08-31 22:35:25 He predicted oi would crash in 2000 while Simmons took the other side of the trade. As you know oil went up 15 fold in the next 8 years. There will never be another Matt Simmons but that is how God designed it, we each have something to give.

656 2018-08-31 22:35:16 Had Nutella for the first time on vacation. I understand the hype. Too much sugar though, plus seed oil and soy. If someone made a sugar, soy, and seed oil-free hazelnut spread I bet they'd make a killing.

661 2018-08-31 22:34:29 Personally, they can't fool me.  I only use organic virgin olive oil or some cocunut oil!

663 2018-08-31 22:34:17 I can recommend tea tree oil! I find it good for my ear piercings
664 2018-08-31 22:34:11 Stop using oil. Turn off the AC, take transit, stop flying.  Get some skin in the game.     If you think we shouldn’t use slime don’t use it, try living off solar and wind at your own expense.  If you don’t you’re just another environmental hypocrite

671 2018-08-31 22:33:13 We aren’t talking about an oil spill in national or international waters. We’re talking about hurricanes that hit PR & other places.

Nothing you are saying is changing the truth. According to the constitution the president can’t act unilaterally…
672 2018-08-31 22:33:10 The thing about Elon & this principle of “if you buy a tesla you are saving the world” is flawed for one in particular reason. Experts say that for every drop of oil/coal/gas that I cut back on, it is consumed by someone else. So there is no savings. It is a transfer. 1/

674 2018-08-31 22:32:32 Well you may as well since we don't have an oil industry. The word incompetent does not even begin to describe you.
675 2018-08-31 22:32:27 Surprise issues when I go in for an oil change. $40 turns into $400 
676 2018-08-31 22:32:15 On one side that is fair, but the other side is that these two massive sectors (oil and auto) have effectively made only incremental improvements for the last 100 years, and by perpetuating that paradigm we validate it as opposed to replacing it with something better.
677 2018-08-31 22:32:01 it was a global recession that hit most of the oil producing countries lol. Mr Calipso you thought it was Buhari that brought recession to us... You dont know nuffin
678 2018-08-31 22:31:58 Poor Ted, Beto is raising more money from the entire country than you can in Texas. What happened to your oil friends?

688 2018-08-31 22:30:24 We won the right to oil spills from rail cars. We won the right to let food rot because the rails are full of oil tankers. We won nothing of any real value other than emotional satisfaction. In 30 years we might see oil burners are rare
689 2018-08-31 22:30:14 Yes, but the price of turm oil has crashed. Scotland now has a gazillion billion turm oil deficit.
690 2018-08-31 22:30:08 And what would the UCP do, Ed. Lots of criticism, short on actual policy. Slash and burn? I think Albertan's would be very interested how the UCP is going to fill the $10B hole left by dropping World oil prices...

697 2018-08-31 22:29:01 I can't tell whether you're serious (in which case you're being severely willfully ignorant), or just trolling.

If you have 1,000,000 barrels of oil and burn it, it's gone for ever. While the sun shines we'll have wind and solar energy.
698 2018-08-31 22:28:58 I get that too ... I find 2 Oil of Peppermint capsules at night really helps. 
699 2018-08-31 22:28:42 Perhaps we should start rumours of a 90% export tax on our oil to the US.

703 2018-08-31 22:28:12 I prefer Yamani to Simmons. Reserves are a function of price. But $ cost is the antithesis of oil cost. Oil Age is not ending for lack of oil but due to secular decline in EROEI.

705 2018-08-31 22:28:03 Secondly: tarsands oil is DIRRRRRTY oil.. One must be conscientious of the environmental effects that the extraction of #tarsandsoil has, firstly in the local area, then spread over the neighbouring regions, then downstream as it were (where the pollutants end up)
706 2018-08-31 22:27:47 That oil change was right on time
707 2018-08-31 22:27:43 Islam is ignorance - barbarian and primitive. That’s a fact. The world has moved and is civilized and stinky arabs are a threat to modern civilization. If you didn’t have oil - you would be ignored
708 2018-08-31 22:27:38 Stop. Don't act like you have a clue what you're talking about. You know about as much about sway bars as you do about changing your own oil.
709 2018-08-31 22:27:29 Help my grandfather just poured oil into my soup
710 2018-08-31 22:27:09 Whatever we want. But we should NEVER impose our standards on another nation.
We still buy Saudi/Qatar/Nigerian oil, don't we?
711 2018-08-31 22:27:05 My car had a oil leak and just blew up :))) Happy Friday!
712 2018-08-31 22:26:39 For your kind information rupee is performing well against other currencies! where all other currencies are performing low against Dollar! Hike in oil prices is common! So better to think how we can boost our economy, rather to find fault of the government! 
713 2018-08-31 22:26:31 Bout to take me a bath with some lavender essential oil 
714 2018-08-31 22:26:17 I’d much rather drive 27 minutes out to the suburbs to the good McDonald’s, get home only to find  my fries taste like they were fried in oil sheen than to listen to that preacher #AreathaHomegoing #ArethaFuneral
715 2018-08-31 22:26:09 Prova con Bio oil, io l'ho usato sulle cicatrici di una operazione è funziona alla grande ( se applicato costantemente). Lo puoi trovare in farmacia. 
Se ti va prova, io mi sono trovata benissimo
716 2018-08-31 22:26:05 Would you try a dish marinated — or tossed — in a “signature sesame-oil-and-sriracha sauce”?
717 2018-08-31 22:25:56 Scream.  i was not impressed i felt no oil in that 
718 2018-08-31 22:25:49 You are very incorrect in this statement ms. Notley. 
Firstly, there are a maximum of 50 - 100 years left of crude oil on the planet. 
This means that persons with ACTUAL VISION, must start taking hold of the reins, to ensure that we aren't ending up in a badnewsbears situation!
719 2018-08-31 22:25:36 You can get 35% off all our CBD oil products this Labor Day weekend. That includes our most potent 25% Pure Gold CBD Oil  Hope this helps, I'm glad to hear it's helping your son.

تحياتي لك اخي الكريم
721 2018-08-31 22:25:28 Just a quick tip; when taking omega 3 supplements or fish oil try to take it at night because it could help in lowering blood pressure and relaxation
722 2018-08-31 22:25:15 It means if Canada doesn't want to ship to the US it's likely oil from other countries like Saudi Arabia may start to be imported to WA.
723 2018-08-31 22:25:10 Crude oil is just domesticated dinosaurs
724 2018-08-31 22:25:09 Getting an oil change is always so scary. Like what will you find? What do I need to replace/repair now? 
725 2018-08-31 22:25:08 I underestimated how busy it would be at @elkgrovetoyota for an oil change. It’s midday Friday before a holiday weekend. I was super impressed that the line moved quick and I was a offered a drink or snack while I wait in my car.
726 2018-08-31 22:25:04 LATAM Oil & Gas / Panacol was unable to complete the financing commitments, the Agreement has been terminated.

US$2.4 million security placed by Panacol as guarantee in front of the ANH for the SN‑9 license commitments will remain until the commitments are deemed complete 1/2
727 2018-08-31 22:24:50 Get the oil hot. 
728 2018-08-31 22:24:45 Sask by itself about 7 yrs ago would be the third or fourth! When Potash, Oil and other resources and commodity are higher!
729 2018-08-31 22:24:37 If this pipeline is ultimately stopped and there is a major train disaster along one of our major salmon rivers I wond what tune she will be whistling then? Oil is still here for decades. Even if we had electric transport trucks trains ships and planes it would still take decades
730 2018-08-31 22:24:15 BC doesn't use Alberta oil.
731 2018-08-31 22:24:11 The looting under Abacha was huge and economy was a lot weaker. OBJ got to work and increased growth in big rates in his first term  even with low oil prices. These facts are incontrovertible. 

Rather than try to challenge it, let’s discuss how Buhari can match it.
732 2018-08-31 22:24:10 Bruh this jojoba oil/castor oil mixture blew my hair out lol wow
733 2018-08-31 22:24:10 New reserves have been found (new techniques, even the nasty fracking), off-shore oil was very much under estimated (nobody knew how much could it be), and among all sand oil became a very large source, which almost nobody was thinking it was possible a few decades ago.
734 2018-08-31 22:24:01 Yay we stopped pipe line now we can import foreign oil from dubious countries with questionable human rights and even more questionable environmental policies and cost Canadians jobs at same time well done well done
735 2018-08-31 22:23:51 @RobBreakenridge I bet they will stand behind Quebec dairy but not Alberta oil. we don't matter! With guys like Butts as an advisor, who is anti oil, there's no way TMX is going forward! It's not a political loss for JR, he doesn't get much support from AB anyway!
736 2018-08-31 22:23:45 Get on the cannabis oil treatment.
737 2018-08-31 22:23:45 My brother just called to remind me that my car’s oil needs changed regularly. My whole family thinks I’m a big ball of idiot.
738 2018-08-31 22:23:42 You would never do that @garymasonglobe - I make your day brighter as you navigate pipelines, NAFTA, the Tory faithful, more pipelines, oil, Seahawks pre season performance - the list goes on......you need me!
739 2018-08-31 22:23:37 I've thought the Holy Spirit and the oil before.  It was your words about the Bridegroom always arriving that really struck me.
740 2018-08-31 22:23:26 Stevie’s harmonica has oil!
741 2018-08-31 22:23:23 And it doesn't mean I don't think we shouldn't do our best to prevent such. But the impact from this on climate change would be practically nothing. Big Ag does way more than oil and cars.
742 2018-08-31 22:23:17 Some rehabbers I know use oil to help release the glue
743 2018-08-31 22:22:56 The NRA I don't have a problem with because their money is going towards protecting the 2A, and they are funded by members like me. I do have a problem with lobbying groups like with big oil and big pharma.
744 2018-08-31 22:22:42 Please what does Duncan Mighty mean by "If I break your heart na oil spillage"?
745 2018-08-31 22:22:41 What are you going to do? Change the process that you and your friends created? Nullify a court order? Somehow improve the grades of Alberta oil and make it actually desirable? Give incentives to create refineries here? Redefine the word “export” to mean “use in Canada?” What?
746 2018-08-31 22:22:24 C'mon. You know that PM Butts & co have absolutely NO INTENTION of building a pipeline. They are 100% opposed to oil, as per Leap Manifesto. Cut the crap. Start reporting on The Butts government's TRUE agenda. Then we'll see if you can get them re-elected.
747 2018-08-31 22:22:17 Over $400 from Tut today. So basically he found his oil baron.
748 2018-08-31 22:22:11 Olive oil is like the next thing to water
749 2018-08-31 22:22:06 Aug. 16, 2018 PentaNova announced SINU‑9  Farm Out Agreement w/ Panacol Oil & Gas wholly owned subsidiary of LATAM Oil & Gas failed to close by the agreed closing date. Extensions to the closing dates were given, but Panacol was unable to complete the financing commitments
750 2018-08-31 22:21:52 Proverbs 5:3-5

For the lips of an immoral woman are as sweet as honey,     and her mouth is smoother than oil.
But in the end she is as bitter as poison,     as dangerous as a double-edged sword.
Her feet go down to death;     her steps lead straight to the grave.
751 2018-08-31 22:21:46 How does the coal and oil cause change on the other planets in our solar system ?
752 2018-08-31 22:21:26 From most of us in Canada f-you trump.... maybe we should raise our oil and water ? Hell just out water maybe lol
753 2018-08-31 22:21:22 Hopefully our negotiators take their time rather than buckle to a bully like you. Besides I am getting to like the thought of not having a legal obligation to delivery a set percentage of all oil and gas to the US.
754 2018-08-31 22:21:21 Is that why he is Increasing Nato
Growing the economy
Making USA the largest oil producer
and Increased Russian sanctions

Is that what Putin wants?
755 2018-08-31 22:21:19 Why do you expect USA to continue to pay up for a problem that’s 4000 miles away. What about their oil rich Arabbrothers and sisters take up some slack for a change
756 2018-08-31 22:21:18 Looks like I picked the right week to get into CBD oil
757 2018-08-31 22:21:16 My V ran out of oil while I was driving it today 
758 2018-08-31 22:20:57 Get CBD oil / CBD rolled out !!
759 2018-08-31 22:20:17 Hoje acima de tudo lindo e cheiroso pra prestigiar o aniversário de meu grande amigo daily oil, também conhecido como irmão do gui no la luna.
760 2018-08-31 22:20:13 قدر الله وماشاء فعل
761 2018-08-31 22:20:09 Came to get my oil changed at a Take 5 place and they walked right up and gave me a bottled water  10/10 service lol
762 2018-08-31 22:20:04 Yeah I was expecting some jibes but he was quite complimentary wasn't he   no mention of oil money or human rights atrocities which makes a change when people mention city 
763 2018-08-31 22:19:55 Right..we only get the majority of our oil from Canada, fucko.
764 2018-08-31 22:19:51 He look like he smells like Ax, some type of oil, and natural hair products.
765 2018-08-31 22:19:46 @bevelsupport Also if I order the subscribe for the monthly shipment do I get - 1 Safety Razor - 1 Priming Oil - 1 Shave Brush - 1 Shave Cream - 60 Free Blades - 1 Restoring Balm? Or just a 1 Safety razor and shaving cream.
766 2018-08-31 22:19:38 Walmart has everything. You can also use coconut oil for your nipples too. And if they get too painful, use your own breastmilk on them, I promise it helps. & okay love. If you need anything don’t hesitate to ask. 
767 2018-08-31 22:19:38 Lol what an idiot snake oil salesman.
768 2018-08-31 22:19:33 Checking back in on #arethahomegoing and watching folks SLIDE on outta them pews. I’ve eaten my lunch, run errands, had a coffee break and the oil changed in my car, and they’re JUST finishing up the eulogy. AND I didn’t even miss @MsGladysKnight or @StevieWonder
769 2018-08-31 22:19:11 What? This is a non argument. You are directly taking the plot of the movie while Trump is “bringing oil back!” and killing the country.
770 2018-08-31 22:18:59 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
771 2018-08-31 22:18:58 I like my shawty smothered In coconut oil Ngl
772 2018-08-31 22:18:51 OMG Now No.45 @realDonaldTrump using Viagra, Cialis AND Olive Oil! That's a scarey thought! @GOP , @NVGOP
773 2018-08-31 22:18:34 A third part is found there are dealing with rose oil; for a dog's head revered throughout the same sort called chamaeleon,
774 2018-08-31 22:18:30 Thanks for the banter Chris. You know Matt Simmons always believed that a real global recovery would come on the back of a high  oil price. With the US just announcing that they plan to spend 60 Billion bucks to counter OBOR we may see that, vs the fake recovery we have now.
775 2018-08-31 22:18:23 Am no oil painting but thanks Barry 
776 2018-08-31 22:18:13 tea tree oil >>>>>>

783 2018-08-31 22:17:27 My son was diagnosed with epilepsy 3 years ago & at one time he was on 3 different prescription medications at once. I took it upon myself to taper him off two of them & replace w/ CBD oil. He has been seizure-free since 6-6-18. It is very expensive but completely worth it.
784 2018-08-31 22:17:21 Sn: Baby oil have the curves looking HD
785 2018-08-31 22:17:12 oil is never going to boom again in Alberta the way it has in the past. oil reserves are diminishing. Alberta has some of the *dirtiest* and *most expensive* oil in the world. the value-effort matrix for our oil extraction process is completely unbalanced.
786 2018-08-31 22:17:01 Actually the regular use of any sweet oil can do that and more in other parts of the body 
787 2018-08-31 22:16:32 I wanna get a hot rocks massage done or like hot oil or whatever. I also want to try acupuncture
788 2018-08-31 22:16:26 Bout a fuck around and buy me some oil blotting sheets

793 2018-08-31 22:16:03 Also, the coating/paint lasts longer on new pavement/asphalt, starts with a tighter bond w/o oil, dirt, tire rubber, etc.
794 2018-08-31 22:16:02 @subaru_usa will not do the right thing after our engine through a rod to a KNOWN problem with their engines and oil consumption. DO NOT buy a Subaru!!!!
795 2018-08-31 22:15:40 Ecuador is trying to get its finances back on track after racking up billions of dollars of debt to China in loans-for-oil deals. Interesting to see US-backing @Super_Crypto
796 2018-08-31 22:15:36 Ive been using since like a month sesame oil to remove eye makeup because i ran out of makeup remover and that was the only oil i found in the house and wtf my dark circles absolutely vanished off?

798 2018-08-31 22:15:18 This brings an important point. If US no longer have to depend on foreign oil, US doesn’t need biofuels. I think they have run their course but in few short years the market will drive them out. Perhaps EU may look into developing more biofuels, they need it the most.
799 2018-08-31 22:15:18 Great Sex Tip: when you're going down, try using massage oil while they ook 'er in the dooker

801 2018-08-31 22:15:09 Being in your mid twenties is weird because you can’t justify buying expensive (really really cool) olive oil even though you can afford it
802 2018-08-31 22:14:53 Actually that's from the heating of our oceans which his state contributed greatly to.. despite his early support to curtail. In the end he caved to oil and gas.
803 2018-08-31 22:14:33 I have something to say. Ladies if you're with a man who works in the core upstream oil industry,  be content with the money that flows to you. Want that same time and attention?  You lost!  
804 2018-08-31 22:14:28 If Trans-Mountain is dead for now, maybe @JustinTrudeau should push for a new Energy East pipeline? It's a win, win. Ship our oil east to Canadian markets, and end our reliance on oil from third-world despots. #cdnpoli
805 2018-08-31 22:14:23 Same. Really need to get an oil change for my car but LOL.

808 2018-08-31 22:14:11 Michael Eric Dyson is trending for some random media appearance. The guy literally uses word salads and is a snake oil salesman without any arguments to offer.
809 2018-08-31 22:14:08 ITS OK LOL we have some lavendar oil and vanilla extract at home which should be ok even if they arent specifically fragrance oils but i got some apple cinnamon too!!!! except i cnat smell. so its purely for my housemates benefits
810 2018-08-31 22:13:51 One gorgeous Lady like to see her with oil on her body
811 2018-08-31 22:13:50 Add to that list the cells of aborted fetuses. These Satanic monsters laugh and laugh at us. See: Paddock v. Gov. Butch Otter concerning denying us CBD hemp oil in Idaho. The tenants of my Faith are in there concerning vaccines along with requiring cannabis buds for Holy oil.

846 2018-08-31 22:09:20 I don’t own enough oil for the media to make me care bout Russia…
847 2018-08-31 22:09:10 Folks, priests do not have magic powers, they are circus hucksters pushing snake oil, religion & you gotta quit it.
848 2018-08-31 22:09:05 Burning the after midnight oil
849 2018-08-31 22:08:57 Paid for from tax revenues on oil, gas, autos, mining, forestry, manufacturing, small business etc because we are all happily employed ... with excellent prospects!
850 2018-08-31 22:08:54 Girlllll next time go to Downey express car wash it is about $30-$60  depending on what type of oil your car uses and you get a free car wash with it
851 2018-08-31 22:08:48 oil changes & gas are ridiculous 
852 2018-08-31 22:08:37 Its cuz the US likes Oil. Who have the most Oil? That right! Saudi Arabia

854 2018-08-31 22:08:28 If I have stuff on hand, I use a dollop of mayo to the same amount of sour cream  or yoghurt or olive oil. I don't like it too mayonnaisey.
855 2018-08-31 22:08:23 Rock me Amadeus is trending ... Lately it seems everything reminds me of the 80s. The culture we grew up with - the whole punk thing - deserves a revival. It was a fun era. I remember colouring a couple of strands of my hair green - with oil paints! LOL
856 2018-08-31 22:08:12 @jkenney @RachelNotley Now is the time to do the dramatic. Cut Alberta oil and gas production by 50% for a couple months. Don't do so small cut for months. Let Canada feel the pain of how much they rely on Alberta. Doing more for shorter has less impact on Alberta workers.
857 2018-08-31 22:08:03 Cannabis Oil!
858 2018-08-31 22:08:02 With palm oil and egg
859 2018-08-31 22:08:00 not oil. its because the US securities market is as big as $500 trillion and larger than rest of the world combined. so if you need to trade financial or mercantile contracts, American market is your best bet for which you need to buy US dollars
860 2018-08-31 22:07:52 さまいちのことしか考えられなくてしんどい
861 2018-08-31 22:07:50 I am a proud Canadian w many US friends, but your president has crossed the line. It is time for Canadians to stand firm for NAFTA I believe 40% of the oil the US consumed comes from Canada, so I propose we add a 25% tariff exported oil, 25%  on all  exported electricity /water
862 2018-08-31 22:07:49 mom and I went to the local health food store and spent an hour jizzing our pants and drooling all over the floor. Most of it's expensive stuff but not all! It'd be a great place to splurge once a month for ingredients someday hhnnngggg!! We got CBD oil that was on sale!
863 2018-08-31 22:07:49 I dunno. Is there a right way to ship what's been called the "dirtiest oil on planet"? Just sayin'
864 2018-08-31 22:07:43 Geez. If you are referring to Victoria, the treatment plant is fully funded and construction will begin soon. So, that problem solved. Now lets focus on climate change by stopping the pipeline and moving off oil quickly.
865 2018-08-31 22:07:35 So Ameican social democrats want to raid Medicare to pay for a petro economy (that has no oil) and a duel currency system.. Makes total sense.... #tytlive
866 2018-08-31 22:07:26 So, this getting started is a package deal?  I have the bulletproof oil....low carb diet....coffee is kinda expensive
867 2018-08-31 22:07:19 Bitumen is not even oil, it is filthy stuff and huge amounts of energy are required just to get it out of the ground. It’s dirty, inefficient and expensive, exactly the opposite of what we need right now. #leaveitintheground.
868 2018-08-31 22:07:00 Of course Heid ..yea ..yea .I'll pass them on to him.... Hick!
869 2018-08-31 22:06:59 The young gal who just changed my oil was one of the friendliest, happiest people I have ever met and she gave  to her job. I don’t think she is in her “ideal job” but she is there, busting her butt, and making the most of it. No doubt she will be successful in life. #respect
870 2018-08-31 22:06:52 Satan is alive and well in Washington D.C.!  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!

873 2018-08-31 22:06:01 May be backing into your middle/inner ear which can cause your jaw to ache. Thieves oil drops in a pot of boiling water. Oregano oil but just a very few drops. It is a "hot" oil and can sting and burn if not careful. Gargle with salt water. You can also boil water with just salt.
874 2018-08-31 22:05:56 you should have seen me trying to get an oil change at the dealership....i’m like ummmmm hi soooo uhhh helo
875 2018-08-31 22:05:51 Do not adopt the Hamas propaganda, learn the true facts.
You don't see or hear the whole picture, it's not that simple as you describe. Occupiers vs. liberators. Hamas and liberation is like water and oil. Even PA boycotts Hamas.
The sanctions on Iran are also collective, so?
876 2018-08-31 22:05:35 If men can be sent into a combat zone in Iraq at 18 with an M4 rifle by the government beaurocrats just to get more oil, give them a damn beer! #2A
877 2018-08-31 22:05:31 "Healthcare is a right" Mr. Gillum?  It's just like any service. Like an oil change, or new tires. Your car; you pay. You're not going going to add "Car maintenance & tires is a right" to your platform are U? #HaveHadItUp2Here w these #ClassWarfareWarriors w a #VictimMentality
878 2018-08-31 22:05:15 Brad has a strong point Kyle. You think gov can fix climate change? Under your watch, you’ve also flushed a toilet. And you’re using an iPhone  (parts of which are derived from oil) Shame! Check yourself, before you throw stones.
879 2018-08-31 22:05:05 Been using almond oil on my hands today. They feel wonderful, but more so my cuticles look/feel amazing. No more redness or snagging cuticles 
880 2018-08-31 22:04:50 There’s no skill that Isn’t,  going back to @BritishCouncil ‘s report, Nigeria’s biggest asset isn’t oil, it’s in our people.
881 2018-08-31 22:04:48 I hope he can recover I was hoping to see him in oil silks soon but hey if Bernard can do it Mantha can too. Heal soon Ryan!!!
882 2018-08-31 22:04:29 I have the scent of: steel, rubber, soap, motor oil, tears, sweat, blood, doritos cool ranch, and cortisol
883 2018-08-31 22:04:28 If you work in oil and gas => OIL
Palm oil merchant => OYEL

884 2018-08-31 22:04:27 News flash dude, the people saying climate change isn’t real are funded by fossil fuel industries. THEY have a DIRECT INCENTIVE to lie about this. THEY make money when people don’t believe in climate change. THEY want you to use more oil and coal.
885 2018-08-31 22:04:24 2b fair there're outspoken Native leaders like Clarence Louie and Manny Julian, and successful bands like the Osoyoos Band + many great FN companies that service the oil patch. But they are often sneered at 4being "apples" red on the outside white on the inside by other bands

887 2018-08-31 22:04:02 Hopefully this oil change will fix everything wrong with my car (it won’t)
888 2018-08-31 22:03:50 Thank you!! Honestly, mine usually don't look like this  I haven't been consistent with castor/coconut oil but you should be! I massaged a mix into my scalp/on my hair, left it overnight, washed it out. Comb my hair out with my fingers. Then put dove whipped cream mousse
889 2018-08-31 22:03:40 i also always use coconut oil
890 2018-08-31 22:03:31 Incorrect. Alberta receives the Health and Social Transfers every year ($7 billion this year). We also received Equalization as recently as 2015-16 ($250 million). Also, oil revenue was excluded from resource revenue until the 1980s giving Alberta a huge advantage.
891 2018-08-31 22:03:03 I made chicken marsala for the first time by myself today and it came out rly well (despite the fact I added a tad too much oil) 
892 2018-08-31 22:03:02 We don't sell them oil at a discount. We sell it at the highest price they are willing to pay. They are a net exporter of oil.
Oh, and the powerful lumber lobby in the U.S. would be ecstatic if we stopped selling them lumber. Our lumber producer would be pissed.
893 2018-08-31 22:02:53 U.S. Tankers transport 37million tons of oil, per year, from Alaska through Northwest Passage! They are far more dangerous to our oceans/0rcas !
894 2018-08-31 22:02:50 Como se roba un PBI? Mediante retornos de obra pública, coimas, retornos en la venta de gas y fuel oil, etc, te alcanza para más de un PBI, el ministerio de planificación era. El reino de chocolate papito
895 2018-08-31 22:02:45 I was gonna take my bf to La for his birthday and he said no we can’t go because the car would need an oil change  okkkkkay

897 2018-08-31 22:02:37 They also want to cut "Red Tape". ie the health an safety regs that keep our oil workers safe & well.
898 2018-08-31 22:02:33 As usual this is a decision that only looks at the surface of the issues. If oil would excluded half our houses would crumble. Even Aspirin is derived from oil...www.livescience.com/24752-surprising-oil-uses.html
899 2018-08-31 22:02:16 We have big oil, big tobacco and big pharma, now we have big straw.
900 2018-08-31 22:02:07 It needs to be 3 locations. Midland/Odessa, Dallas/FTW and maybe Houston. Two are benefiting from the oil industry and DFW is being targeted by the opposition. I want a ticket!
901 2018-08-31 22:01:34 Oh yeah, oh yeah...yeah COME AT ME BRO. WE”LL JUST SCALE OVER THESE DAMN MOUNTIANS AND TAKE ALL YOUR DIRTY OIL HOW YA LIKE THEM APPLES?!?!!
902 2018-08-31 22:01:26 Cbd receptors are located all over the body,especially the brain.Big Pharma has to keep their sheep in the playpen.All eyes on me Ggle is behind this study.I'll still continue to chase my insane in the membrane Cbd with that liquid heart attack aka coconut oil.
903 2018-08-31 22:01:24 Damn Mula thats insaine! Is that oil taste any good?
904 2018-08-31 22:01:22 صادق في كلامك يا باشا

907 2018-08-31 22:01:10 @GolfChannel 
Why are you showing Phil M. leaking oil during your coverage? Show the leaders. Thanks
908 2018-08-31 22:01:07 Burning oil for transport needs to stop. Now what what about all the other industries that use gas and oil, just about impossible to name a product that does not use a petroleum derivative in its manufacture.
909 2018-08-31 22:01:02 MR take a look $WTI  Mexico oil. Waiting for me to come back then I load it. Will on time for NAFTA deals with all
910 2018-08-31 22:01:01 Hone ave oil city cancer donation
911 2018-08-31 22:00:33 Lyndsey, if Alberta increases it production of oil 10 fold, does that not also increase its emissions 10 fold. Will the Saudi's cut back oil production ? Will the countries that buy Saudi oil cut back buying it ?
912 2018-08-31 22:00:28 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
913 2018-08-31 22:00:08 Also like it, but will soon try vaping oil. Luckily got some good contacts, it's a not acknowledged medicine

917 2018-08-31 21:59:45 Lesson of the day is just do your own oil change 
918 2018-08-31 21:59:43 Of course they do. Republican believe we can literally drink oil.

920 2018-08-31 21:59:36 Why do you care so much about keeping milk prices high but don’t give a dam about selling AB oil at a discount?
921 2018-08-31 21:59:29 Chale chale, that olive oil did the trick!! Once I broke out into tongues, the devil was defeated and soundcloud worked perfectly!!
922 2018-08-31 21:59:17 He's also ruining the oil and gas industry but at least the overpriced milk is protected.
923 2018-08-31 21:59:03 Preying on the weak and vulnerable, these snake oil salesmen are the dregs of humanity
924 2018-08-31 21:58:51 Please tell us... name the program that has subsidized Alberta oil.... I'll be waiting for a long time(forever) for the answer.
925 2018-08-31 21:58:33 Oil picture is supply/demand driven unlike many strategic commodities. You can't print it with a new 3D printer & all the calls of "Lower for Longer" & "Peak Demand" are a FAIL. Do you really think we can cut upstream spending by 40% for 3 years & still produce a surplus of oil?
926 2018-08-31 21:58:21 "For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:" ~Proverbs 5:3 #Jesus #God #Bible
927 2018-08-31 21:58:14 He he making fries in coconut oil, they’re probably gonna suck 
928 2018-08-31 21:58:02 I've been smoking A LOT of oil recently,
929 2018-08-31 21:57:58 countries who had entered into WTO Treaty cannot enhance rates on imported goods and are forced to collect revenue on sensitive commodities like crude oil which leads to overall inflation. so everybody suffers (moreso poor people)since almost everybody gets hit by increase ....
930 2018-08-31 21:57:58 While at the same time letting gangs come into the UK for 2 decades until we have so many people and also victims of rich oil wars that services screwed. In 1997 you couldnt get 200 Bensons through Dover.All socially engineered. Ruined the UK. Now like rest EU its going to shit.
931 2018-08-31 21:57:45 World’s greatest snake oil salesman at work. I’m so tired of the Venezuelan comparisons too. But repeating the same lies over and over keeps the cult members happy. Ugh!
932 2018-08-31 21:57:40 Lmao american exceptionalism is only surpassed by American ignorance. Canada is probably the most resource rich country in the world you get more oil from us than you do Saudi Arabia. This is exactly why we have tariffs, to even the playing field.
933 2018-08-31 21:57:20 I need her to take this car and get it an oil changelike usual cause I cannottt.
934 2018-08-31 21:57:19 I need NY style pepperoni pizza forever. With the crust well done. And juuust the right amount of that heavenly orange oil blessing the top of it. 
935 2018-08-31 21:56:53 like i had two goals today

1. get my oil changed and tires looked at
2. sell my laptop

neither we done
936 2018-08-31 21:56:51 We in Alberta should just shut down all the oil we now send to BC and let them ride their bicycles, walk, and burn their trees in their fireplaces during the winter for heat. In other words, as Ralph said, Let them freeze in the dark”.
937 2018-08-31 21:56:49 IM SO DEAD!  Ngl the man wasn’t bullshittin he suspended me Jude saber and Isiah on THE LAST DAY! Cause they went to the cameras to see who put the baby oil on the stairs cause it was a “danger to students safety” 
938 2018-08-31 21:56:47 The only big problem now is that I would have to reapply serum, cream and oil when I get back , that’s the only thing that is worrying me right now

940 2018-08-31 21:56:18 Just because natives figured out how to make something scrumptious from oil flour and sugar does not discount the fact that the same was forced upon them.  Being good at making lemonade out of lemons doesn’t mean lemons are the answer. Good grief.
941 2018-08-31 21:55:59 Hey buddy , 2-4 drops of oil of oregano under your tongue twice a day and you will be 100% in a day or two ! Tastes like shit but it works
942 2018-08-31 21:55:56 Need to get a oil change tomorrow 
943 2018-08-31 21:55:42 They want to develop the resources but why would Quebec do that when oil and gas revenues would effect its equalization transfers
944 2018-08-31 21:55:19 Do the oil companies pay for the costs to fight these fires? No. It's just another hidden subsidy we all pay to the oil companies

946 2018-08-31 21:55:05 But the dirt and oil in your hair is just going to get all over your body. It might not be much but still 
947 2018-08-31 21:54:52 I didn’t realize it takes 2 hours to do an oil change, tire rotation and put new wiper blades on #KiaService #Slacking
948 2018-08-31 21:54:35 I feel so good when people compliment my hair, thank you, I grew it myself and yes coconut oil
949 2018-08-31 21:54:33 Now the feds need to cancel all subsidies for the oil industry in order to recover the investment at the very least.
950 2018-08-31 21:54:32 You do know that we (America) is having to borrow money to pay for this trade war right?? Europe is looking more favorably on Russia for their oil and petro. China doesn’t care about a GDP! The workingclass will always live hand to mouth there.
951 2018-08-31 21:54:31 The five mother sauces are Béchamel, Velouté, Espagnole, Hollandaise, & Tomato. It's really quite obvious Mayonnaise is a derivative of Hollandaise, just say it out loud. Besides the fact that they are both emulsifications of fat (oil or butter) held together w/ egg yolks. My God
952 2018-08-31 21:53:59 Raises possibility that, as US economy nears capacity, inflationary pressures grow, and interest rates climb in response, a retreat in oil and gas could ensue.
953 2018-08-31 21:53:49 Its 2 words say Hot Air. The oil extracted from the Alberta oilsands is cleaner than the blood filled, terrorist supporting poison being shipped from out of Canada. The traitor trudoe must be removed from office now
954 2018-08-31 21:53:40 If @realDonaldTrump thinks he can bully #Canada by threatening to impose tariffs on our auto industy if we don't bow down to him and spread it for this trade deal nonsense, I think @JustinTrudeau should retaliate with putting tariffs on the oil we export to the States.
955 2018-08-31 21:53:38 He aint chaming shit. they all know how fake he's. The western pol are just as fake as him. That are will to sellout their values for cheap oil
956 2018-08-31 21:53:33 Have you tried CBD oil to offset some@of that pain?
957 2018-08-31 21:53:17 Exactly, so that is what the political issue is, not the pipeline itself. If we don't use oil there will be no pipeline. We need to ratchet up the pressure for lower costs for alternatives to oil so demand goes down. Thus us a demand problem not a production problem.
958 2018-08-31 21:53:16 Why is homie downing a bottle of baby oil though? 
959 2018-08-31 21:53:13 Lexxx picked me up pineapple kush oil, she’s really my bitch
960 2018-08-31 21:53:01 My brother and I are 18 months apart. Due to our birthdays, we were 1 year a part in school. We are oil and water a lot. My sister is   48 months older than me. We are BFFLFAA.
961 2018-08-31 21:52:53 Let him spend some of that russian oil deal check
962 2018-08-31 21:52:52 Rev. M Harris has extracted parts of the bible that have no meaning unless the whole text is read and interpreted properly.  He would do well to preach at church. Gullible people will listen to him in church and political rallies. Snake oil is easily spread.
963 2018-08-31 21:52:47 You don’t know bored until you’re waiting for an oil change 
964 2018-08-31 21:52:46 Chaos Oils for SnS in MHGU are so FUCKING COOL! Chaos Oil to apply all oils (increased affinity, increased stamina drain, no deflect, increasedstamina all at once) on Sword Dance (basically a DMC mini combo)

I'm never using these weapons in MHW ever again lmao.
965 2018-08-31 21:52:41 I’m partial to thighs lol. But be careful with oil you use to fry. Stay the f away from vegetable oils. Bad news. But it is everywhere. So not that easy. That’s why we have so much obesity.
966 2018-08-31 21:52:38 Oil rich Arab countries have trillion's so why are we giving them anything???
967 2018-08-31 21:52:36 Have you tried CBD oil for nerve pain? I use it every day
968 2018-08-31 21:52:31 @realDonaldTrump  this came from Senate.  How can this be true if there isn’t any money for rank-&-file workers? Trump confirmed that his administration may try a legally dubious maneuver to create a $100 billion tax cut that overwhelmingly benefits the wealthy.snake oil salesman
969 2018-08-31 21:52:21 Philippino Oil & Gas Company c1982 - c50% loss

971 2018-08-31 21:52:07 Does anyone ever do the V05 hot oil treatments anymore?
972 2018-08-31 21:51:59 I just dropped $100 for an oil change. Guess what I’m doing for the rest of my afternoon?? Youtubeing how to do your own oil change. 
973 2018-08-31 21:51:29 How can an oil producing Nation be equally home to the the poorest people in the World?
974 2018-08-31 21:51:21 my sister got me this tiny bottle of essential oil from bali and it smells great but how do i use it?
975 2018-08-31 21:51:10 @JayzTwoCents I would love to see you do a few submerged mineral oil builds and testing. Always thought it was a cool concept.
976 2018-08-31 21:51:05 Steelhead trout, counting all the olive oil & butter points, just 8 points, all the same benefits as salmon, they swim in same water, tastes SO much better!!
977 2018-08-31 21:51:05 Yeah so maybe we shouldn’t be increasing oil exports, removing Canadian oil so we have to get oil from other countries to cover domestic oil consumption. Besides I don’t think envirmentalists are in favour of Saudi Oil either.
978 2018-08-31 21:51:00 Let’s get a fair share for our oil resource not sell it at a discount to the US. 
The whole country benefits from Alberta oil. But I’m guessing u already know that.
979 2018-08-31 21:50:56 Put that bad boy on the BBQ with Olive Oil !
980 2018-08-31 21:50:40 Using real full cream butter n at times coconut oil.. Since almost 4 years now, I haven’t been sick, No flu jab ( I don’t believe in it) watch colleagues get awfully sick from it.. I do gym work every 2 days .. I’m very happy man with my being..
981 2018-08-31 21:50:37 They’re cut that way because it allows more surface area in contact with the oil.  Better flavor. Can’t argue facts.
982 2018-08-31 21:50:29 The gallbladder empties when the stomach detects high fat content, so best plan is to cut out high fat meals; doctor’s advice is sound but also cut out deep fried foods or anything cooked with too much oil.
983 2018-08-31 21:50:19 CBD oil, absolutely. Look into PrimeMyBody it's the best.
984 2018-08-31 21:50:07 I just want some fresh oil 
985 2018-08-31 21:50:07 The theme in my view must have been birthed from the recognition that the people must be put back to work to restore the entire Nation to its fruitfulness beyond Oil. The land is Green and Nigeria is blessed. We are walking on Gold & our youth population confirms this.
986 2018-08-31 21:50:07 Sanctions didn't make the Venezuelan government seize the assets of thousands of companies, implement widespread price controls or develop a reliance on oil revenues.
987 2018-08-31 21:50:01 You don't put tariff on tariffs. Canada's interest comes first as well. But you don't see Canada threatening the US with bully tactics like saying they'll cut off the electricity or oil flow to the US.
988 2018-08-31 21:49:57 If it was really about the coast, the cruise ship industry would be subject to the same scrutiny as tankers. Or, if it is safe for 3,000 people on a ship, it must be safe for 3 million barrels of oil on a ship. Can’t let people make that connection.
989 2018-08-31 21:49:54 Saudi Aramco IPO didn't happen because it would have meant Saudi had to open their books & the world would see that 90% of their oil comes from 6 fields that are older than dirt, w no exploration success in the last 40 years.
990 2018-08-31 21:49:48 About time! Let oil rich Arab countries support them.
991 2018-08-31 21:49:30 Everybody waited until today to get their oil changed. 
992 2018-08-31 21:49:12 君を揚げたいな…君を炒めたいな…君に僕を絡めたいな…僕は君のそんな存在になりたい。いや、既になってるだろう?
993 2018-08-31 21:49:07 You cannot argue both that capitalism has failed because of an energy problem related to oil, then say that we don't actually have an energy problem.
994 2018-08-31 21:49:05 おる軽いから吹っ飛ばされるよね
995 2018-08-31 21:48:59 Chopped and browned in oil chicken, paprika, cumin, tomato sauce, minced garlic, chopped onions, salt, 2 cups water.
996 2018-08-31 21:48:43 I went to Ulta for an eyebrow pencil and walked out with that plus foundation, eyebrow brush, primer, an eyeshadow palette, and some oil I thought was cool 
997 2018-08-31 21:48:27 Oh, damn!
998 2018-08-31 21:48:21 I love a good white pizza, thin crust, garlic, olive oil, fresh mozzarella and basil... mmmmmm

What action govt taking to control Rupee and Oil commodity.
I saw your tweet on atalji death when modi walk 10KM with atalji last yatra .We should highlight PM what he does to control Rupee instead how many km he walked
1000 2018-08-31 21:47:55 If Alberta had appropriately taxed the last oil boom then they would not be so desperate today. Too much of our country is based on short-term thinking
1001 2018-08-31 21:47:43 Now indifferent to his SUPPORTERS TRUMP is allowing those WALL ST. THIEVES in bed with HFTs like VIRTU PARTNERS of BELGRADE YUGO. to raise gas/heating oil/commodities et al at the CCM.
1002 2018-08-31 21:47:34 I went to get an oil change and the guy talked to me forever about The Weeknd, because he saw my x’o sticker on my car. Anyways, i get into my car and he left a white rose on my dashboard  that’s cute ! Kinda made my day
1003 2018-08-31 21:47:22 Tf. I was looking at the oil def not listening to you cupcake. Hahaha I’ll be sitting on the other side of the lake 
1004 2018-08-31 21:47:09 Drove almost to Hattiesburg and just found out they stop doing oil changes at 530 #fml
1005 2018-08-31 21:47:08 Burn ya like hot oil

1008 2018-08-31 21:46:47 I get it Lex, but let's stick to oil. Break it down for me, I'm listening.
1009 2018-08-31 21:46:42 Next will be SS recipients. They always base those increases on the price of oil. How stupid. What about groceries and medical expenses? Higher and higher. When there is a SS increase the cost of Medicare is increased exponentially. No help there. But the wealthy must get theirs.
1010 2018-08-31 21:46:41 Dems are trying to pander votes from gullible peeps that actual think they’re genuine. In ‘08 he was called a racist by the same dem snake oil salesmen that throw accolades now.
Pathetic.

Why did Syrians rise in 2011 against Mafia's thieves?
3/2010 IMF report: Syria’s “government finance statistics suffer from major deficiencies with respect to definitions, coverage, classification, methodology, accuracy, reliability, and timeliness.”
1014 2018-08-31 21:46:17 Oil production in Canada is already going up. Besides this pipeline will lead to more oil being exported, which will mean Canada will need to import more oil.
1015 2018-08-31 21:46:16 Hahahahahaha if you don't know he's a liar then you're the deluded one 

So many to pick from but here's a few:

1. "We have legal advice on rejoining the EU after independence" - lie, no advice existed.

2. "Oil is a bonus" - lie

3. White paper - riddled with lies.

1017 2018-08-31 21:46:01 ハルカス吹っ飛ぶんじゃねーかってくらいのカミナリだった
1018 2018-08-31 21:45:52 There are always con artists, grifters, snake oil salesmen, charlatans shuffling around looking for an easy mark. The gullible or needy or greedy are always available as well. It’s life.
1019 2018-08-31 21:45:48 2) As for envorinmental protections, I want controls on pollution but we need to balance our environmental policies against the need for economic growth. And keeping our own oil in the ground while mass importing it from Saudi is not a good solution either.
1020 2018-08-31 21:45:48 If neither animal nor vegetable you be, then mineral you are. If one finger brought oil it soiled others. ~ African Proverb, Nigeria
1021 2018-08-31 21:45:37  Excellent idea!!!  been working phones for @BetoORourke! I have 2 autoimmune diseases w severe pain & nausea. I have to buy CBD oil for nausea from OK because TX doesn’t have stores.  My Dr’s approve! I don’t want THC because of sobriety just CBD! #beto

1027 2018-08-31 21:44:55 China already stopped stocking oil & was able to get about a $4 drift. The reason oil is going higher (and it is) is because you can't burn HFT futures contracts in that sweet Jag you drive. Time for China to restock & just wait until shale rolls over & that is starting to happen
1028 2018-08-31 21:44:54 Oh please, you most likely leaked this yourself! Fake President! Treasonous Snake Oil Salesman! #TrumpRussia #TrumpTreason #TrumpTraitor
1029 2018-08-31 21:44:49 #COT = spec book for #oil as of 08/28/18, net long 550,313; change of 11,528 or 2.14% UP from prev. 538,785; 74.46% of 739,097 max on 2/6/18
1030 2018-08-31 21:44:47 The way I see it, Alberta is being selfish in wanting to export more oil at higher prices to inrich themselves, while forcing The rest of Canada to import more expensive foreign oil.
1031 2018-08-31 21:44:47 I currently have 5 warning lights when I turn my car on; Low gas, low tire pressure, oil change, no washer fluid, and burnt out headlight. I know what my weekend is gonna entail! 
1032 2018-08-31 21:44:40 Did you get any of the sleazy cash his son #KojoAnnan stole from the boondoggle UN oil-for-food farce?
1033 2018-08-31 21:44:00 "Hit"? For what reason? Gotta steal that oil! What ELSE? Leave these bastards to HEAVEN.
1034 2018-08-31 21:43:56 So you're suggesting with MORE Canadian oil, the Saudi's will slow down thier productions or countries that buy from them are going to stop ?
1035 2018-08-31 21:43:53 That extra oil dark girls bathe in to take pictures doesn’t do anything to me. lmao
1036 2018-08-31 21:43:49 Yes gladly. first lather your body and then rub yourself with coconut oil from top to bottom
1037 2018-08-31 21:43:41 Newsflash! There's nothing from a manufacturing standpoint that the US and Mexico can't do without Canada. That includes the auto sector.  Aluminum, timber, and oil aren't growth industries nor high employment sectors. Canada needs this deal much more than the US does.
1038 2018-08-31 21:43:38 That doesn’t make sense. The pipeline is to export oil, so there will be less oil produced in Canada for Canadians to buy. How exactly does this pipeline reduce gas prices? It may be economically important, but how will it reduce oil prices in Canada?
1039 2018-08-31 21:43:23 I need to get an oil change 
1040 2018-08-31 21:43:22 Btw linseed oil is used on slate tiles / under floor heating so we think that the water oily substance was that seeping through the grout was that rather than water causing interesting marks in the grout. All sort of fun...

Asads hijacked Ba’th slogans of Arab unity and socialism. 50 yrs later, zero was achieved
Syria was the only Arab Sunni state to help Persian Shi’ite Iran against brethren Ba’thist Arab Iraq in war

1045 2018-08-31 21:42:59 Yeah, really sticking it to the man. Like an oil company cares.
1046 2018-08-31 21:42:58 But no oil fund 
1047 2018-08-31 21:42:38 From IBB-Gej, Naija got $982 bn from oil. In 3 yrs, PMB made only $94 bn, yet spent more on infrastructure than any since 1990!

1055 2018-08-31 21:41:57 Somehow Justin Trudeau has been able to make himself  more unpopular in Western Canada than his Father.   Seems to always involve oil.

1062 2018-08-31 21:41:07 My CBD oil was literally delivered to my house at 4:20... Nice.
1063 2018-08-31 21:41:06 The pipeline negotiations aren’t about the environment, or consultations with first nations.

It’s all about how profitable the oil & gas industry wants to be.

That’s what all big projects are about.

1073 2018-08-31 21:39:56 Never understood their motive for the alleged interference. Trump is hammering Putin on Gas, Oil and Military Arms deals, Russia’s bread and butter and we’re supposed to believe Putin is behind Trump? More credible for Putin to be behind Clinton.
1074 2018-08-31 21:39:54 to earlier level as they were 3- 4 year back before the bjp rule. but now they are used to charging duties and taxes in excess of 90% in certain states going upto 120% in certain others.

1077 2018-08-31 21:39:20 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
1078 2018-08-31 21:39:10 The last I heard, any of that stuff that comes from the tar sands is known, world-wide, as ‘dirty oil’ and not given the premium consideration due to the massive amount of refining that has to be done, post mining. So there’s one metric off the table.

1116 2018-08-31 21:35:59 Turn off the oil and has and electric from Canada.
Tariff the autos 30% and watch Canada turn into a basket case
1117 2018-08-31 21:35:53 @LovesTravelStop how come you advertise 24/7 road assistance and oil change and you have no mechanic on duty at your Roscoe IL location. Just wasting our time and fuel coming to your location

1119 2018-08-31 21:35:46 Are you supposed to tip when you get your oil changed?? I always have but I always get looked at like it’s not normal 
1120 2018-08-31 21:35:26 You can always use Castro oil or other oils look up online products to use to help grow/thicken hair Pinterest is good to look up diy ones
1121 2018-08-31 21:35:12 i told a dark skinned shorty from shiloh her pussy squirted motor oil 2011 was just different
1122 2018-08-31 21:35:12 How much does Snake Oil go for these days?
1123 2018-08-31 21:35:09 i suggest rubbing baby oil or some form of oil based ointment between your thighs or area of chaffe. yes you're gonna feel a bit slippery/oily in that area but i promise you forget really quick and your skin is protected !!
1124 2018-08-31 21:35:07 RT @LivingSafely: Ritz Original Crackers this September? Its top four ingredients are flour, soybean oil, sugar and cottonseed oil.

1128 2018-08-31 21:34:28 Latest scam in town. A petty trader bought 25 liters of red oil and 25 liters of vegetable oil at the cost of N20k from someone who posed as a supplier, only for her to discover that she bought 25 liters of water each after the person collected her money and left.
1129 2018-08-31 21:34:26 #RachelNotley stamps her foot & has a hissy fit because she's not getting her own way. She destroyed Alberta pushing her oil agenda & ignoring Alberta's other industries, leaving every Albertan with a dried out, smelly province & dwindling . Time for her to grow up or get out.
1130 2018-08-31 21:34:25 Interesting.... and 63 years later, we are still using gasoline and oil.
1131 2018-08-31 21:34:21 If Notley was really upset, she would turn off the oil taps to B.C. next week for a week....@RachelNotley

1134 2018-08-31 21:33:43 Standard Oil (1911) is the classic case of a company that had become so large & powerful that it simply crushed its competition. No need for innovation. I like freedom too but govt is necessary (military, police, environmental protection, infrastructure, etc.).
1135 2018-08-31 21:33:34 Background: Comes from Edo period hair oil salesmen who took their time chitchatting with the customers when selling.
1136 2018-08-31 21:33:29 I just took my car in for an oil change. BY MYSELF. I’m pretty good at this adult thing.
1137 2018-08-31 21:33:29 To light our oil lamps in our cabins.
1138 2018-08-31 21:33:24 It’s so awkward when you pull up for a oil change and all the techs poke their heads up with the “fuck off” look lol
1139 2018-08-31 21:33:18 Where are men like Moghalu,Peter Obi,Duke,Okonjo iwela etc?

They won't just get ticket!When we're stock with recycling leaders like ur herder in chief..which you also campaigned and voted for. 
Angel Michael soaked your cane in engine oil waiting for you to make mistake in 2019.
1140 2018-08-31 21:33:08 You could say Google is the Standard Oil of our day, but worse. In many ways they control what information we get to see and have access to many personal & financial records globally.
1141 2018-08-31 21:33:01 I'm having a hard time reconciling the fact that Canada's Ron Paul wannabe truly believes the most sinister threat to Canadian success is...

A milk cartel.

Not oil industry lobbying, not ISPs with 4:1 profit margins.

It's the dairy industry.
1142 2018-08-31 21:32:58 It was about lining their pockets. They’ll be standing in line to be hired by the gas, oil, telecom, banking industry
1143 2018-08-31 21:32:52 I have a lot of bad qualities but you best believe I’m anal about changing the oil in my car regularly. I want to drive that thing until I’m 35.
1144 2018-08-31 21:32:46 I put mine in old oil bottles tho
1145 2018-08-31 21:32:42 The part about charlatans and snake oil salesmen who are false prophets and blaspheme the Word of Christ.
1146 2018-08-31 21:32:21 Try CBD oil!! It’s amazing for pain relief and so much more!!
1147 2018-08-31 21:32:20 Alberta I know knows how to negotiate better than that.

PS: that “discount” is not a function of country negotiations. It is a function of access to diverse markets with different prices. Works as long as Alberta producers can get oil to a coast.

But let’s not imagine that.
1148 2018-08-31 21:32:19 Look at big picture, the EU is Russia's biggest opponent, the UK is a regional power in decline. It's in the Kremlin's interests now to keep Scotland out of the EU. We're in a strategic position accessing the Atlantic and we're the second largest oil producer in Europe.
1149 2018-08-31 21:32:10 Lol u have dirty mind dai

1151 2018-08-31 21:32:06 Agreed.  When oil was a viable industry, Alberta gave away its resources for a song with too low taxes, too low royalties.  Norway got a decent return and developed in an environmentally sustainable way.  Propping up this dying industry is a crime against future generations.

1169 2018-08-31 21:29:24 Why not?  The only viable replacement for fossil fuels is nuclear power.

I'm thinking about picking up a dozen donuts from @dunkindonuts for the mechanics as a bribe. What blend of donuts would you suggest?

1178 2018-08-31 21:27:29 Agree on small size, but marginal barrel prices the whole.  CNY oil contract gives power to the buy side, and China more control over CNY/USD, phys oil flows & China’s commodity BoP

In fact?  Don't bring a dip stick into the house...AT ALL!!
1183 2018-08-31 21:26:56 Your friends < Earth. We need to start the process, it won't happen overnight, it can be done without instantly destroying the oil economy we are heavily dependent on today. Green jobs are jobs too.
1184 2018-08-31 21:26:52 Canada supplies oil and hydro to many US states What would happen if we stopped! Remember the blackout a few years ago. Beware Trump. Your are playing with Fire!!!

1186 2018-08-31 21:26:39 America has a 750 year supply of coal. America has more oil reserves than the Middle East. America has as much natural gas as Russia. America must increase utilization of of our own energy and reduce energy prices for American citizens.

1192 2018-08-31 21:25:40 People would argue about upfront cost of EV over ICE, but if less maintenance and fuel costs makes up for it, I would.

I saw the insides of an ICE car: so many moving parts that can fail! Messy motor oil and radiator fluid to worry about, mechanics you don't know if overcharging
1193 2018-08-31 21:25:37 I was talking to my daughter about how I went to an HEB and a dollar general before I picked her up looking for oil sheets and they didn’t have them and she’s like “the dollar store?, wow they have everything no one needs”  I was like what lmao

I can’t hear the heart, this old oil stain
1197 2018-08-31 21:25:05 I am amazed at the number of golf magazines at the oil change place
1198 2018-08-31 21:25:03 So it is better that the oil is transported through my community by rail?  Perhaps you should give up some of the billions that we give First nation people every year and we can then improve tanker cars and rail lines. Victory for  you, defeat and higher gas prices for me, Right?
1199 2018-08-31 21:24:56 Yemistá "quick to make" -- srsly?  And no olive oil in the recipe??
1200 2018-08-31 21:24:24 Castor oil, which is used in the     treatment of a number of skin problems such as wrinkles, age spots, moles, dark spots, fine lines, and pimples, and can also be used to get rid of stretch marks.
1201 2018-08-31 21:24:19 Bad 
-perfumes and dyes irritate skin 
-mineral oil and petroleum in makeup clogs pores 
-silicone dries out skin
1202 2018-08-31 21:24:10 How is it the least ethical?  KSA doesn’t even give women rights and will stone people to death. Btw you are getting confused, yes oil sands are the worst source, but that does not mean we are the dirtiest producer of oil. Apples and oranges.
1203 2018-08-31 21:24:06 Interesting.  Is this regulatory, precautionary, or both? Wouldn't it be feasible to go solar/wind and wean off oil longer term? Pay for tech now, ramp up efficiency and lower cost.  Drive a market through innovation and mass production?
1204 2018-08-31 21:23:58 You can read the weather you can predict the price of heating oil. I think you asked me that because you think the final club that’s easiest to get into is the one where I’ll have the best chance.
1205 2018-08-31 21:23:55 Yes the east coast does have huge oil and gas resources, conventional offshore, and unconventional in shale oil.  Do some research.  Imo Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick should all have to develop its resources before collecting equalization that mostly comes from oil anyway
1206 2018-08-31 21:23:44 When international crude prices were low bjp levied a lot of duties on crude oil ( their assumption being people are used to giving 70+ rs for petrol when prices were 100$+ per barrel so if the price is down to 35 -40 $ per barrel we can charge excessive duty so they infact...
1207 2018-08-31 21:23:25 A world historical figure like Aretha obviously had to know snake oil salesmen. (Academics too)
1208 2018-08-31 21:23:17 Like big oil doesn't get enough subsidies already.  
1209 2018-08-31 21:23:12 Is hers stuck? She might need some bacon to help oil the tail gears.
1210 2018-08-31 21:23:09 New tires and an oil change? The guy hooked another customer up with a deal. He better hook me up with one because shit is expensive man
1211 2018-08-31 21:23:06 me too, but I just ordered some oil. 
1212 2018-08-31 21:22:57 Guess you are using gallons of "3 and 1" oil
1213 2018-08-31 21:22:57 J HUD sounds good, but she has no oil! #ArethaFrankinFuneral
1214 2018-08-31 21:22:53 I think that would mean Alberta oil would remain discounted defeating the entire point of access to Canadian tidewater.
1215 2018-08-31 21:22:45 Gravy fries are good, but the Hat should use beef #tallow for the fries. They currently use veg oil.
1216 2018-08-31 21:22:44 I do live In the west, always have. Trudeau hasn’t phased out the oil sands, and it isn’t going to happen anytime soon. Eventually they have to be phased out, but that’s not happening. Oil production is up.
1217 2018-08-31 21:22:37 So are oil pastels just grown up crayons?
1218 2018-08-31 21:22:33 COLD PRESS COCONUT OIL which U did. I grew up on this stuff, the smell never bothered me. I drank it by the tablespoon, cook with it, bake cake with it.. 2 months later went back to GP, he was surprised that my LDL was way lower n HDL much higher..
1219 2018-08-31 21:22:14 Max, read your own link, your data includes oil that is refined.  So the crude coming from our country, once refined in your nation means you have more?  OR means you refine more?  Obviously, it's the second.
If you didn't need our crude, then please explain why you're buying it?
1220 2018-08-31 21:22:10 I believe that they do give everyone free food in Cuba. Of course it's in the form of a crate of bulk food (rice, dry pasta, flour, cooking oil, ect) that everyone has to line line up for every month. I don't think that's quite what he envisions...

1226 2018-08-31 21:21:25 The energy crisis we are speaking of right now, mentioned in the article, is that oil needs to be replaced as an energy source, but we don't have a suitable replacement. Oil is an energy resource, therefor it is an energy crisis.

1232 2018-08-31 21:20:39 They're not related, since KM oil wasn't intended to go to the US and has no effect on their production.

1245 2018-08-31 21:18:54 This whole time I thought I needed an oil change but it turns out I needed a tire rotation.
1246 2018-08-31 21:18:52 4 years ago after following a Dietician diet plan, I ended up being told by the GP that I was heading for a stroke due to very high LDL. The American based Dr J. Mercola straight away told me via email to dumb all thise rubbish cooking oil and go...
1247 2018-08-31 21:18:42 It's fascinating stuff..I had wanted to stay away from  oil (important yes, but didn't want to be petrol geologist) & just sort of assumed sed = oil, but it's so much more! I'm visibly excited in the class.
1248 2018-08-31 21:18:40 liberal application of oil usage is quite :)
1249 2018-08-31 21:18:34 so I go to the same place every time to get an oil change cause my dad is good friends with the owner and these mofo’s didn’t make me pay for it....today is a good day
1250 2018-08-31 21:17:53 Ha ha yeah, that's not me. I grew up in Calgary so I understand very well the dependence on oil jobs. But I know a lot of them can be retrained in wind or solar. But  not everyone will make it. Which brings me to UBI but that's not a can of worms I want to open here.
1251 2018-08-31 21:17:51 no,  you can just farm form. If you have a full party then cost is probably around 30-40 oil per fight. takes 4 fight in total so from 120 to 160 oil per round + 10 to even start the map. I'm running on 16 so  im to tal im only spending 74 oil
1252 2018-08-31 21:17:32 Two brothers are fighting by the side of the road. Two motorbikes have
fallen over on the shoulder, leaking oil into the dirt, while the interlocking
brothers grapple and swing.

1256 2018-08-31 21:16:50 I think its just peanut oil
1257 2018-08-31 21:16:50 Blessed to have family members that are successful in the oil & gas industry.

1265 2018-08-31 21:15:51 I own a farm. Wouldn’t bother me for a second it a pipeline went in. The research and development of leak detection that is going into these new lines is amazing. What worries me way more is the massive lines of oil cars I see heading through every day.
1266 2018-08-31 21:15:39 ...of cumming again. The sensation of the oil on her breasts was both soothing and stimulating. Suddenly she decided that she had had enough of playing on her own and that it was time for her to 'call out' her not-so-secret voyeur. But would he be up for the task, she wondered...
1267 2018-08-31 21:15:31 Car wash oil change and full tank let's goooo somewhere lol
1268 2018-08-31 21:15:27 Why don’t you use your billions that you received from the coal and oil industry (Global warming hypocrite) to help the wounded vets and/or the homeless. No, you rather spend millions on bashing the president that 50% of the country voted for.
1269 2018-08-31 21:15:19 Why don’t they get their $ from their oil countries?
1270 2018-08-31 21:15:12 Psalm 23...

Even when enemies are present, God provides food for our sustenance, we're never cut off from His generous hand(my cup runs over)& His teaching/comfort (oil)
1271 2018-08-31 21:14:59 Roquefort? Funky Stilton? I just make a sauce to toss the wings in. Soy sauce, ginger, garlic, sesame oil, sambal, maple syrup, fish sauce too if we getting gnarly. I'm STARVING!

1285 2018-08-31 21:12:57 Thought of that.  Perhaps all those soon to be gone oil refinery’s would be a place to start. But alas my friend. It’s gonna take a bit more than that. But hey. Let’s let them plant a bunch b4 we tell em. Ok?
1286 2018-08-31 21:12:57 I have to ask, at the risk of sounding dim: What is a SLOP? In 12 years of teaching I have never heard of that one. The marvellous Google suggests Standby Lube Oil Pump, amongst others!
1287 2018-08-31 21:12:51 I believe india high oil consumption and account deficit played a role ,as trade war looms fpi will avoid markets such as India with high foreign capital infusion from USA due by services export .

1290 2018-08-31 21:12:30 Man I wish @spotify would cut the shit and drop InfoWars, because I miss it a lot but not as much as I hate insane conspiracy theorists who pedal harmful nonsense and literal snake oil.
1291 2018-08-31 21:12:19 I mean most cars run on corn oil and regular oil, so driving to the grocery store and buying ground beef, noodles, fresh broccoli, milk, orange juice, a gallon of ice cream, chocolate syrup, carrots, apples, oranges, and other stuff is KIND OF vegan...
1292 2018-08-31 21:11:48 Said it before, will,say it again, Europe can transport by pipeline, oil though several countries,no problem. Canada can't transport across one province.Are we not all Canadians helping one another.
1293 2018-08-31 21:11:38 I always come to jiffy lube to change my oil and it's always a fucking mistake
1294 2018-08-31 21:11:37 Are you blinded by the way this government is dealing with every economic situation?  Oil and gas is our backbone and we have lost billions of dollars in investment going to the United States, equalization needs to change, TMX and now NAFTA maybe.
1295 2018-08-31 21:11:23 Just learned how to change my oil! 
1296 2018-08-31 21:11:15 Wow. You can’t possibly be this stupid. Have you even SEEN Fort MacMurray and the oil sands? They’re raping the earth up there. It’s a horrific ecological disaster. Stop lying.
1297 2018-08-31 21:11:12 New tires oil changed bitch i got a new car

1300 2018-08-31 21:10:39 From my new book, OIL and GOD
To combat jihadi terror, Muslim Brotherhood’s embrace of Arab Spring’s representative democracy is the answer, the sharpest weapon against Wahhabi indoctrination that democracy is a Western conspiracy to kill Islam.
1301 2018-08-31 21:10:39 A black woman empowerment group started their retreat today and the dining room smelt like coconut oil and black magic
1302 2018-08-31 21:10:20 Trump wine, Trump steaks, Trump university, what a snake oil salesman.
1303 2018-08-31 21:10:16 It is a very very powerful sensation! I am looking at things and wondering how it is people can't see the extreme division! Let's keep oil in our lamps, keep watching, and definitely keep praying! Come, Lord Jesus!
1304 2018-08-31 21:10:12 “Plus” the U.S. is close to if not the #1 in oil production..

Why?

Screw Paris
Screw Carb tax’s
Screw red tape EPA BS.

Just 3 easy things you’ll NEVER find in Canada(with 3rd most oil reserves on earth).

Maybe saving it for a Martian takeover.

1308 2018-08-31 21:10:01 Yup it's true... Sold snake oil again smfh
1309 2018-08-31 21:09:50 @ESPAskincare Hi ESPA are you able to send me a sample of your Balancing Face Treatment Oil so I can try before I buy please?
1310 2018-08-31 21:09:47 Under NAFTA, I don't think we can, once they have started, and they have obviously. NOW: if NAFTA was gone, in say 6 mos. or a bit longer..... that is a VERY interesting question.  Water more than energy. Oil is easy to buy.
1311 2018-08-31 21:09:41 Turn off the taps & refuse any further oil money going to Ottawa.
1312 2018-08-31 21:09:38 Just as the North Sea oil industry enters terminal decline, as well:  it will have to be legal eagle!
1313 2018-08-31 21:09:15 When I lived in Alberta, I was involved with a number of energy organizations that were working with Ms Kelly, the UNIFOR organizer who was linking Alberta with the UN on perfecting synthetic oil. I did a report on that epoch if you are interested. I pull for the NDP v the Cons.

1315 2018-08-31 21:09:02 Facts forgotten:

In 99, oil price averaged $20, OBJ inherited an econ at 0.52%GDP rise and rose it to 9.5% in 2003 at end of his first term with oil at $28

In 2015, oil averaged $49, PMB inherited  econ at 2.7% , sank it to -1.5% in 2016 and 0.8 in 2017 with oil at $52. 

Think
1316 2018-08-31 21:09:00 i came to get an oil change and they said it’d be an hour and a half.. i wonder if they’d wake me up if i took a little nap
1317 2018-08-31 21:08:52 To paraphrase comments made re: Trump and coal—@AndrewScheer does realize that oil is burned, doesn’t he?
1318 2018-08-31 21:08:50 Not gonna hurt the US. Auto tariff goes to 25%, auto sector moves to Detroit. You do know that's what he wants, right? Lumber jobs would look good back in the US too. Oil sludge?, Not a biggy, we know people.
1319 2018-08-31 21:08:45 Can’t ever show enough love to cbd oil, that stuff works miracles
1320 2018-08-31 21:08:39 I'm having a uniquely specific problem where a bunch of coconut oil that was half solid, half liquid fell into a basket of all my clothing hangers... this is snuglife.
1321 2018-08-31 21:08:21 For me brushing and combing my hair just turn my curls into one big puff. I’ve been using tea tree oil while it’s wet and it’s been helping with how unruly my hair is plus it’s great for moisture since mine is bleached
1322 2018-08-31 21:08:19 Just be sure you've already checked the oil, washer fluid, tire pressure, etc. Do NOT wait until everyone is in the car, before you remember you need to do that!
1323 2018-08-31 21:08:03 That’s all he doing. No oil, no spirit. Just hot ass air. 
1324 2018-08-31 21:07:55 When I lived in Alberta, I was involved with a number of energy organizations that were working with Ms Kelly, the UNIFOR organizer who was linking Alberta with the UN on perfecting synthetic oil.

1325 2018-08-31 21:07:45 What kind of essential oil do I need to repel all the crazy bitches and fuckboys from my life
1326 2018-08-31 21:07:34 How do you think oil workers in the west are fairing? But we support the east! Hopefully some there support us!
1327 2018-08-31 21:07:27 Its so nice to be in a studio class again. I'm trying really hard to improve at Art, and I'm learning a lot. Plus... oil painting is really cool
1328 2018-08-31 21:07:25 I love shampoo with tree oil ... the tingle is the best feeling 𗀍
1329 2018-08-31 21:07:25 It makes us a social democracy which, true enough, is different than a democratic socialist country.  The creeping authoritarian practices that eroded some of the democratic principles of Venezuela, plus oil prices tanking, and other missteps might be reasons for chaos.
1330 2018-08-31 21:07:24 Got to get my smog done change my oil and register my car for another year on the same day. :))
R.I.P. like $500
1331 2018-08-31 21:07:23 "Sup, babe?" 

Ered looked up from the motorcycle she was repairing, oil scattered all over, a cool smile on her face
1332 2018-08-31 21:07:12 I lived toxic for yrs. thinking prescriptions will make me better. Not for my body. I needed CBD oil, Hempseed capsules, and CANNABIS. Proof
1333 2018-08-31 21:06:52 I just bought a cool new Poo-Chi robot dog!  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
1334 2018-08-31 21:06:41 Why does cbd oil have to fuck with bc, that shit would be so helpful but I’m not trying to have a baby rn.
1335 2018-08-31 21:06:30 i’m terrified of an oil fire so that puts cooking anything that has to be fried out of my dinner options. But i rly want an empanada soooo 
1336 2018-08-31 21:06:27 And it's expected to continue to 2050. Hardly, oil running out, few years left as everyone was told 2014. So I'm cool with it
1337 2018-08-31 21:06:23 A $5 or even $10 a barrel export tariff on Canadian oil would get his attention. Contrary to popular opinion the US still imports 10 million barrels a day of oil and many of their Gulf Coast refineries can't process any crude but the heavy oil sands stuff.
1338 2018-08-31 21:06:20 Yolanda Adams and that “oil” gets you every time!  She showed out for Anita Baker and now Aretha! Everything she sings - there’s oil on it! 
1339 2018-08-31 21:06:15 No worries - the big story is that they bullshitted everyone by saying oil was running out (by 2019 I think the BBC reported IIRC). I just think we should focus on that deceit.
It’s a huge resource, huge financial benefit to Scotland if we fly solo.
1340 2018-08-31 21:06:07 Literally just cleaned my engine & gave my car an oil change. Talk about an independent woman
1341 2018-08-31 21:06:02 Time to develop the billions of barrels of oil on the west coast of Newfoundland    Develop rules and regulations for hydraulic fracturing.  Solve some of Newfoundland’s economic problems and create jobs.
1342 2018-08-31 21:05:54 I’m trying this rose hip oil. I’ll let you know the results in a week
1343 2018-08-31 21:05:53 Is there an oil for that? 
1344 2018-08-31 21:05:41 And was wham oil was at $150 a barrel
1345 2018-08-31 21:05:41 Perhaps not. I’ve just yet to see a reason why our current system is in any way better. Less choice. More expensive. Less power to the individual.  Our current healthcare is a result of the same snake oil 401k was.
1346 2018-08-31 21:05:37 It won't take long to evaluate oil numbers,i feel they are now moving into the Kim.

1349 2018-08-31 21:05:21 Ya but we have oil!!. Nvm
1350 2018-08-31 21:05:21 الله يكرمك يارب
1351 2018-08-31 21:05:02 Sure so we can start selling our oil in Canadian dollars? Free market right?
1352 2018-08-31 21:04:53 This is sooooo much worse than the oil spill. All of my business has evaporated since May!!  We need help to fix this but most importantly, need to get our business back!
1353 2018-08-31 21:04:40 We both reached for the gun oil
1354 2018-08-31 21:04:25 I have a list CBD oil, Hempseed capsules, and CANNABIS saved me. I'm healther and stronger off legal prescriptions. This has to stop!!

1358 2018-08-31 21:03:47 She comes from 1800’s oil money and was 35 years old when Jackie Robinson first played an MLB game. Her nurse probably has to put up with 24 hours a day of the most racist dementia induced mutterings you can imagine.
1359 2018-08-31 21:03:44 Does this include oil & gas? Minus oil & gas that US needs and Canada  buys way more stuff fr United States  than exports to US. Run numbers again without oil & gas you need. Rather buy oil & gas fr Middle East? That doesn’t make sense.
1360 2018-08-31 21:03:43 Cut off the power and oil exports to the US if Trump puts tariffs on Canadian automobiles. Once the lights go off in NYC for a day or two, we may have some Trade negotiation leverage.
1361 2018-08-31 21:03:41 They have. There’s The CBD Store OKC, CBD Plus USA, Vapor Haven & CBD Oil, No Rhyme or Reason Kratom Shoppe & CBD, and CBD Wellness Of Oklahoma plus Dispensary, CBD American Shaman OKC, Artisan Botanicals CBD and Kratom, as well as
1362 2018-08-31 21:03:35 You should do better than this than rely ONLY on @Dolarpo 's analysis . I am not saying his wrong but many others would have been quoted. @Dolarpo knows the richest lawyers in this country are not the Keyamos but the noiseless and very slient Oil and Gas SANs.

1377 2018-08-31 21:02:18 The minute the US sees that BC has only one trade partner for oil and gas, the price will go up.  Way up.  Remember Trump is at the helm.

1385 2018-08-31 21:01:11 Ok. As an oil worker, I'll accept. Go with no one I know knew of it. However I fail to see how it doesn't help. It's Scotland's oil, Scotland's future. It's figures are correct. So, no issue. And let's face it, Westminster is better at playing dirty than we are. No harm no foul
1386 2018-08-31 21:01:06 Lol I did this today. Ijebu garri, very dry and oil beans.
1387 2018-08-31 21:00:55 That ball is likely covered in oil and thrown by lying SJW's! Uncle Ethan is the supreme master of reality! 
1388 2018-08-31 21:00:53 You do know, Donald (of course you don't, but I'll humor you) that all Canada has to do is say no and the original NAFTA stays in place - kill it, and America loses more than a million jobs and cheap oil...and have a nice impeachment. 
1389 2018-08-31 21:00:44 RT @LivingSafely: Ritz Original Crackers this September? Its top four ingredients are flour, soybean oil, sugar and cottonseed oil.

1395 2018-08-31 20:59:54 @AndrewScheer there’s not much clean about Saudi oil or Venezuelan oil, or African oil either.  What’s your point, @garymasonglobe?
1396 2018-08-31 20:59:46 Why would they do that?what benefit they would have by forcefully making it mandatory?how they convinced Shias (leave other sects)  as Shias came into existence after Imam Hussain RA not 1920 . Shias would never put anything in their belief how much ever oil Saudia may have

1401 2018-08-31 20:59:22 Why asians say oil = oiy
1402 2018-08-31 20:59:19 Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Eat sardines for shiny hair. Avocado is excellent for your hair. Is it NISIM or NHB?  Prevents hair loss. or closely related. What can I do to uncover the actual web address. Gentle to hair. Gentle to hair.
1403 2018-08-31 20:59:15 that's like saying only people who want the US to spend 700B a year on defense, should have to pay taxes for defense spending, or that only people in favor of a war should be drafted into war, or only people who favor farm/oil subsidies should have to pay for them.  it's silly.
1404 2018-08-31 20:59:01 おはありです！
1405 2018-08-31 20:58:56 Why. UNRAH is a corrupt and hate filled group whose money should come from members of the oil soaked ultra wealthy Arab League. Why should the west continue to perpetuate this charade?
1406 2018-08-31 20:58:52 Grapes must be crushed to make wine. Diamonds form under pressure. Olives are pressed to release oil. Seeds grow in darkness. Whenever you feel crushed, under pressure or in darkness, you’re in a powerful place of transformation.

1408 2018-08-31 20:58:49 President Jonathan was sent packing because he was tryna sanitize the petroleum industry, You met submarine somewhere in Niger Delta my region you never cared to know who they where and they’re busy sucking our oil underground. Smh
1409 2018-08-31 20:57:57 Europe's a pretty large market. China there's plenty. We got oil gold diamonds etc not worried so need to be sorry
1410 2018-08-31 20:57:57 We have a verticaly integrated market. We supply you with most of your precious metals,
Hydro electric power, water, a significant amount of oil. No question a trade war will hurt us more than you but what “friend” gleefully screws over an ally for no reason than the leaders ego?
1411 2018-08-31 20:57:52 but you folks were the party that screwed all the oil files up with Harpo's 'my way or else' and ignoring valid treaty rights of indigenous peoples and repeatedly wasting time taking measures to the SCOC and losing every time.

1418 2018-08-31 20:56:45 Where do you think the pipeline protesters get their $ support, the US of course - because if Canada ever gets act together and we get the ability to ship our oil to other customers via pipeline, the US won't have the cheap product from us to drive their economy and drain our
1419 2018-08-31 20:56:45 I hope the baby boomers take the oil industry with them when they go

1423 2018-08-31 20:56:07 Use coconut oil for cooking and coconut milk in coffee and green tea. Cooking in cast iron pan is fine but what about ceramic coated pans?

1425 2018-08-31 20:55:31 The old big money in this country large part of it is based on oil they will fight tooth and nail to the detriment of us all to protect this source of wealth
1426 2018-08-31 20:55:21 Taste it. What do you think it needs? I literally made nachos yesterday and the only salsa I had in pantry was green hatch chili salsa with lime juice. It needed a little olive oil, red wine vinegar, & believe it or not, a dash of sugar. Could have used more heat, too.
1427 2018-08-31 20:55:07 Did Ireland just discover Oil?
1428 2018-08-31 20:55:03 He gave Sheldon Adelson $325 Million tax cut, Koch's 1.2 billion, His family over a billion and billions more to Coal,oil,Wall street banks etc. Wake the heck up voters he is incapable of running the country!

1437 2018-08-31 20:54:14 #TagOil highlight

$5.1 million of cash flow 
lowest production time of the year good for one quarter.  
up to 1400 BOED /generates about 7.5 million cash flow a quarter (at these oil prices) which = 30 million annually and = trading just 1X times future cash flows
1438 2018-08-31 20:54:05 I'm not booming.  Who is booming in Texas??  Big oil and gas corporations?

1439 2018-08-31 20:54:04 If you’re not good enough to get Alberta off its reliance on oil and steer it into the 21st century then you’re just not good enough.
1440 2018-08-31 20:54:02 An oil change takes 2 hours..
1441 2018-08-31 20:54:01 If my memory is accurate, 40 yrs ago in the archaeological museum at Syracuse, you could open stacks of drawers and see small objects (bronzes, tools, oil lamps) neatly arranged beneath glass covers. It was like a treasure hunt.

1443 2018-08-31 20:53:49 I have natural hair( ya girl is black here) but the oil I use is argan oil
1444 2018-08-31 20:53:41 @realDonaldTrump  have to ask why gas jet fuel etc are going up when we are now producing more gas & oil than we ever have. Normally the more plentiful a product is , the cheaper it gets. I personally think the oil companies & retailer are getting greedy. Please check into this.
1445 2018-08-31 20:53:40 Aye
I repaired a rusthole bigger than my hand today and the car looks waaay better now. I still need to repair the steering, brakes, oil pump, clutch, headlights, broken suspensions, lack of radio, other rust holes, and the most important... I need to repair the chassis O.o
1446 2018-08-31 20:53:38 But forcefully making it mandatory around the world for followers certainly started when Arabs became oil rich otherwise it was limited to Orthodox families.
1447 2018-08-31 20:53:36 "Mhmmmmm. So, you're saying, should I get to the point where I try and dip your hand in boiling deep frying oil, that you'll happily let me?"
1448 2018-08-31 20:53:35 maybe too much oil then idk aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
1449 2018-08-31 20:53:15 Yeah sure I’m all Ms. Independent until I have to get an oil change by myself...gotta admit, a mans would be helpful.
1450 2018-08-31 20:53:11 OPA preço bom, é oil free
1451 2018-08-31 20:52:56 Extra olive oil
1452 2018-08-31 20:52:54 Emails don't take from the poor and give to the rich like Trump's tax law.  He is in office thanks to Russian agents manipulating you with email worries and now he's crazy with power for oil drilling on public lands, overturning conservation and clean air laws. What a nut!.
1453 2018-08-31 20:52:42 Not once did that idiot Rex mention the Billions of &$$$ in subsidizing oil/has literally giving away our resources while corporate thieves benefit! At the lowest price per barrel in 2014-15 WTI was about $26 bel that would be about $16 Canadian Select! See Suncor profits 
1454 2018-08-31 20:52:42 That came with a sample of beard oil didn't it.
1455 2018-08-31 20:52:39 What did it matter where you lay when you are dead? In a dirty sump or on a marble tower on a high hill? You were dead, you were sleeping the big sleep, you were not bothered  by things like that. Oil and water were the same as wind an air to you.
1456 2018-08-31 20:52:24 Our oil is the Dirtiest in the world. It’s so full of sulphur that new international shipping regulations mean its almost unusable. It’s also the dirtiest in terms of environmental impact. How can a Canadian leader be so ignorant?  There aren’t even refineries in Asia for it!
1457 2018-08-31 20:52:08 Yeah keep in mind were we stand no more electricity from james bay no more oil no more beef no more wheat our health care system will steal business from you since a business in canada is covered

1459 2018-08-31 20:52:04 Pure peppermint oil works a treat for getting rid of them. Also, lavender attracts them if you have any. I won’t have it in my house in case a spider catches a whiff lol
1460 2018-08-31 20:51:49 “chile, Imma need to lay hands and anoint you with oil"
1461 2018-08-31 20:51:47 washing tip: if you have a stubborn oil stain that u just can’t get out, try putting dish washing liquid directly on the stain & then washing it. Works wonders for me.

1464 2018-08-31 20:51:37 It does attract but only to a small extent. Small, local differences in gravity are measured to locate different densities in the crust, they are used by Oil companies and mining companies to locate new reserves. They are also used to calculate accurate local tide tables.
1465 2018-08-31 20:51:21 yup! i use that and coconut oil on my mouth every night after i wash my face.
1466 2018-08-31 20:51:12 First of all u said lotion. If it’s a lotion it not a butter as it has more water in it. Butters are usually shea or cocoa butter whipped with some coconut oil or something

1469 2018-08-31 20:50:35 Russia had no economy. Oil prices were way down.
1470 2018-08-31 20:50:19 You think Canadians are idiots? You think we can’t see Alberta/Conservative pols are bought by the oil industry? How many 10s of 1000’s of green jobs are not created across Canada because the oil industry owns you? #ClimateChangeIsREAL
1471 2018-08-31 20:49:57 And what about crude oil rate in global international market  seems u forgot to mention crude oil rates in 2010 and 2018 
1472 2018-08-31 20:49:52 So the people who were camped out 24 hours a day were working from home? You do know these protests are funded by American millionaires trying to landlock Canadian oil?

1475 2018-08-31 20:49:34 What do you need from Canada you ask?

Just a small list of things that would cost you 3 times the amount anywere else.

Oil.
Electricity.
Dairy.
Cars.
Lumber.

I can continue going on and on and on if you want?

What we don't need from America is idiots like yourself.

1484 2018-08-31 20:48:02 The test will be for the next generation. In about 50 years time when the regions oil reserves have depleted; the US has been succeeded by China; and the surrounding Arab states are even more pissed off.
1485 2018-08-31 20:48:01 So sick of this gluten free bullshit. Can places do more for us? Sick of going out for a meal and there only being like 2 options which are bland and shit. Fry your chips in separate oil at least. There's more of us than you think.

1487 2018-08-31 20:47:55 Max, you guys buy 5 million barrels of oil a day from us for $22CDN a barrel.  China and Europe pay OPEC nations $66 USD a barrel.   If Trump kills NAFTA, we can sell our oil anywhere, who is going to sell it to you for $22 CDN then?
1488 2018-08-31 20:47:50 When a DIY space is about to get torn down and turned into a microbrewery, I say we should have a good old fashioned downhill skateboarding race to resolve it. Team DIY wins, we keep the house! IPA fat cats win- we hand over the lease! Hope they don’t slick oil the track!!!
1489 2018-08-31 20:47:31 everything smells like neem oil to me now
1490 2018-08-31 20:47:30 Why can’t I ever just go to get my oil changed, or get air in my tires, and that be it. There is ALWAYS something else wrong and I have to spend 46,926,954 dollars that I don’t have to fix it.
1491 2018-08-31 20:47:19 Uhuru: What are people yapping about?
Parliament: They want bread (VAT free oil) 
CS Rotich: Give them cake,  why can't they eat bread anyway?  (16% VAT)

Kenyans, let say no.  Enough is enough!!!
1492 2018-08-31 20:47:05 On the scale of things, supply side management is a smaller issue. Look at our economy, our trade with United States, our out-of-control illegal immigration, and our lack of energy independence causing us Albertans to drive on Saudi oil. Aim higher please.
1493 2018-08-31 20:47:00 You said that scientists making money off it means they’re lying. Oil companies make more money than the scientists do, and politicians have plenty of other ways to make money that don’t involve billions of dollars to fund an international conspiracy

1495 2018-08-31 20:46:37 I Needed To Get A Oil Change 
1496 2018-08-31 20:46:35 I am sure there is plenty of blame to go around. For example, when oil prices go up Alberta cuts taxes instead investing more in education or creating a sovereign wealth fund.
Regardless, past mistakes are there to be learned from, not to justiify future ones.

1501 2018-08-31 20:46:11 China and the BRICS nations are gunning for the PetroDollar. If oil producing nations start accepting gold backed Yuan over US dollar (why wouldn’t they), I think the decline of the dollar will be steep and rapid.

1508 2018-08-31 20:45:07 What I don't understand is Trump is digging his heels in over diafiltered milk and the dairy industry and can't seem to grasp NAFTA is the only reason why American refineries can buy our crude oil for ridiculously low prices. They pay us $22 CDN a barrel.

1529 2018-08-31 20:43:10 Is't that what a grifter, confidnace man, or snake oil saleman does - lies to people telling them what they want to hear as he stuffs his pocket full of money.  Take the gloves off and call him what he is.
1530 2018-08-31 20:43:06 Of oil?
1531 2018-08-31 20:43:02 Yes, I agree we need to do more to get our oil to the world market.

1533 2018-08-31 20:42:43 Hi ho! Hi ho! It's off to @CincyChildrens I go! After an oil change and a quick stop at Walmart. And probably lunch.
1534 2018-08-31 20:42:38 Excluding pretty much anything - oil, autos, etc isn’t in the spirit of NAFTA or how current accounts are calculated...everyone agrees NAFTA needs a refresh - but the political narratives are at odds with the facts. Both sides should stop cow towing to their bases and do a deal
1535 2018-08-31 20:42:28 Unless there's oil or natural gas. At that point maybe worth 250k

1543 2018-08-31 20:41:54 Letme just put you on Jamaican black castor oil.
1544 2018-08-31 20:41:52 Good advice for Mr. Trump. I’m quite sure we have the resources and capabilities to make anything we need. The USA on the other hand doesn’t. Our electrical power, oil and water doesn’t really need to be sold to you along with uranium, grain etc. perhaps others want it.
1545 2018-08-31 20:41:42 Cant complain at that! I remember drinking Old Engine Oil back in the 1990s, Asda used to sell it. Was good then and still holding its own today.
1546 2018-08-31 20:41:41 @cafreeland Great press conference just now. You handled it in your normal professional way without spilling any leaks. Hopefully oil is in the discussions as we do not want to continue to sell it to USA at the cheap price it is now being sold for.
1547 2018-08-31 20:41:40 There are cities where they could make more money (oil states). And there are cities where they could raise the profile of the sport. But I don’t think there’s any city where they could get so many people attending in the best time zone for global TV. #Tennis #ATPFinals

1563 2018-08-31 20:39:30 An economy can't grow by 40% per year and 8% is still not bad considering rising oil prices, falling Rupee and Trade Wars. Indian economy is now worth 2.85 trillion.  Unfortunately, we are not China to grow double digits for two decades.
1564 2018-08-31 20:39:16 Who says the oil companies are doning the lying. If you ask me it is the politicians who are lying. It is there second nature to sell half truths.

1567 2018-08-31 20:38:48 Oil and gas. Ain’t much in Quebec and eastern provinces. No votes to be had out west. Alberta may as well be on mars. Liberals have always had a eastern Canada bias. They keep their voters happy.
1568 2018-08-31 20:38:46 I've read dousing in olive oil and coming them all out is often the gentlest way but most time consuming. 
1569 2018-08-31 20:38:43 Giuliani can not write anything against a mueller report. He has the credibility of a compulsive lying snake oil salesman. Trump is finished.

1571 2018-08-31 20:38:22 And yes we depend of oil because the state seized all the other companies and now those companies doesn't work that's socialism the state controlling you and your companies and what you eat and they use that to make you poor and them rich
1572 2018-08-31 20:38:06 The way U Liberals R going we won't need a Carbon Tax or  climate change Initiatives, cuz there won't be any factories producing and we won't have a market for our oil. R cost of living thru the roof . On the+side, it'll solve our illegal immigrant problems the Free ride is over.
1573 2018-08-31 20:38:02 The deposit is not a solution. We need to resume oil and gas export, control on revenues of ports, resuming production of Aden refinery, real fight against corruption
1574 2018-08-31 20:37:43 yeeeeaaaaahhhh, i was looking at a bunch of fancy oil paints the other day and my wallet was like BITCH I THINK NOT lol
1575 2018-08-31 20:37:37 Honestly.  It's like they never heard a Latin/Hispanic nickname before.  They just don't get what a truly "melted pot" diverse culture we have.

Go over to a Cruz interview tho, and you would think we are nothing but guns, oil, and BBQ.

1577 2018-08-31 20:37:12 Well I would take a lot of time to look at these and think about it quite a lot more. But, you said the economies I sent it around oil or timber, but is that nationalize or is revenue raised through the higher income tax?
1578 2018-08-31 20:37:06 Nothing this man says or writes can downplay a mueller report. Giuliani has the credibility of a snake oil salesman.

Will the obstructionism ever end and pipelines get built? Not under these s
1581 2018-08-31 20:36:22 somebody wanna come get my truck and take it to get a oil change so i don’t have to get outta bed 
1582 2018-08-31 20:36:22 This happened to me and Todd on the way to my Dads once. Stuck near Doncaster for 4 hours as there was an oil tanker spill on the motorway. It sucks  glad you finally got back
1583 2018-08-31 20:35:54 Huh. USFS lands directly south of the mouth of Lamoille Canyon are among the parcels proposed for oil and gas leasing.
1584 2018-08-31 20:35:42 It’s funny how people support some industry but not others. It kind of makes me Think.  With the right rules and regulations why isn’t oil and gas being developed on the west coast of Newfoundland.  It seems like a scandal to me.
1585 2018-08-31 20:35:36 Diversify your economy instead of relying in oil. If you had done it before you would not be there.

1596 2018-08-31 20:34:01 Also with no NAFTA we will become self sufficient as it pertains to oil. The oil sands in northern Alberta have an abundance. No NAFTA allows us to refine all our own oil and the markup to our American neighbors will be substantial. Your President does not understand trade

1647 2018-08-31 20:27:28 Bishop need BJs, Costco, and Sam's Club supply of holy oil and holy water after this speech... #ArethaHomegoing
1648 2018-08-31 20:27:25 The PM of UK will never be the same again after dancing on African soil especially South African oil oops soil ...
1649 2018-08-31 20:27:20 I don't need it either but it still be lit asf. Combination of oil and spit is heaven. 
1650 2018-08-31 20:27:19 @jasonkenny   U just said now that oil was off the agenda in NAFTA. it isn’t. U just lied. Everyone wants this out of agreement as since 1994 when Conservatives did not fight for this in original NAFTA agreement we hv been hosed from day one
1651 2018-08-31 20:27:15 Who got some oil
1652 2018-08-31 20:27:00 Everyone else has nationalized their oil. By your logic, we should too.
1653 2018-08-31 20:26:44 Lol you didnt have a club til the oil money
1654 2018-08-31 20:26:41 Pepper soup and yam and oil 
1655 2018-08-31 20:26:37 Yeah I've just ordered one for you as well
1656 2018-08-31 20:26:36 I pan sear mine in olive oil, butter and garlic. This one was prepared by  fit trainer.
1657 2018-08-31 20:26:28 this is why I like regulations. I don’t want a govt small enough you can inject your balls w motor oil. I want that to be controlled and punished to the full extent of the law
1658 2018-08-31 20:26:25 Yeah. I find the illegal (via show rules) things body builders do to their body fascinating and sad. Especially those that inject mineral oil or synthol into their muscles to make them *look* bigger.
1659 2018-08-31 20:26:23 You forget your history. The checked bag fee started after oil prices spiked to over $150 in early 2008. The justification was that they needed the money for the high cost of fuel. Of course, the price soon dropped and it sits at $67 or so. The airlines kept those fees tho.
1660 2018-08-31 20:26:18 If Cruz was anointed by God then even God can't beat an insane reality tv criminal? I always thought it was Koch bros & big oil who anointed Cruz to pander to naive white God fearing middle class seniors?
1661 2018-08-31 20:26:10 I would do everything possible to help Saudi Arabia conserve its oil. Many people in the Middle East is aware that we are over the limit of carbon in the atmosphere. Get Canada to help develop the Union for the Mediterranean @UfMSecretariat

1664 2018-08-31 20:25:49 Oh my god! Is it April 1st? Who in their right mind would have a cast made of their vagina? Must be a joke. Is it??
1665 2018-08-31 20:25:44 Hell.  Why not?  They import everything else - Water, oil, cars, homeless people, Democrat illegal voters, trees, money, drugs.  Why not fish.  There are not enough in the Pacific?
1666 2018-08-31 20:25:35 Once a week I shamelessly walk around with coconut oil drenching my 30 inches of hair for 24 hrs. I’m amazed at how girls with stringy, broken, dry hair that is only 16 inches judge me. HOW DO YOU THINK I GOT IT THIS LONG AND HEALTHY?! TAKE NOTES INSTEAD.
1667 2018-08-31 20:25:32 Hilary....you have gone quiet on me.
Are you on the phone for one?
1668 2018-08-31 20:25:29 This is horrible, shows that Alberta isn’t cared about enough to create more jobs and oil, the court has made a bad decision

1670 2018-08-31 20:25:22 Dock damage adds to Venezuela’s oil export troubles...
1671 2018-08-31 20:25:13 When you beautifully shine your hardwood floors with orange oil (smells so nice) and it turns into an indoor slip 'n slide... but, it looks good 
1672 2018-08-31 20:25:03 I like steam extraction, but usually get alcohol extracted oil. I tried some that had been extracted with butane once, and could taste the chem residue 
1673 2018-08-31 20:25:01 Maishanu the oil merchant.
1674 2018-08-31 20:25:00 Nope, DoTerra is a brand of essential oil we sell at the office. But now I'm curious what you're talking about??
1675 2018-08-31 20:24:51 *eyeroll* Ron this is beyond whether you agree with her policies, she’s blatantly creating fantasies & using similar techniques that we would see in snake oil salesmen. She is inventing realities which simply don’t exist. It isn’t about disagreement, it’s about the truth.
1676 2018-08-31 20:24:50 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.
1677 2018-08-31 20:24:43 And those involved are those from the oil rich states. Despite the 13% oil money.
1678 2018-08-31 20:24:41 What is the exponential relationship between the current fiscal monetary policy and the one adopted after the oil boom of the 1970s
1679 2018-08-31 20:24:40 The oil is under control and their country gold too. No one cares about the people suffering so no need broadcast the news about them apparently
1680 2018-08-31 20:24:30 Came to the dealership for an oil change bout to leave with a new ram 
1681 2018-08-31 20:24:16 Somebody sit Clive down and bring up somebody who got the oil #ArethaFranklin #ArethaFrankinFuneral
1682 2018-08-31 20:24:16 That’s ridiculous... probably paid for by one those nasty oil giant companies that never give anything back to society
1683 2018-08-31 20:24:14 Dang so Aretha’s funeral still going on? 

I have went to school, failed a test, gotten an oil change and some more.
1684 2018-08-31 20:24:14 How is it that I’ve been feeling sleepy greater pat of today? Burning the midnight oil?
1685 2018-08-31 20:23:58 What BC and others need to realize is that oil is used for many reasons and we need to get oil to market to fund Canada's economy not just Alberta. Would they rather have the oil moved by rail?
1686 2018-08-31 20:23:56 Alexa... add black seed oil to grocery list
1687 2018-08-31 20:22:59 “Environmentally friendly oil” sounds like an oximoron no? 
1688 2018-08-31 20:22:50 I voted for the NDP to end our corrupt oil industry controling government. They have broken that promise. I'll be giving my vote to the socialist candidate.
1689 2018-08-31 20:22:37 I think it's the other way around. US $ has been commoditised/fixed via tripartite prepay to US oil reserves #OilStandard If I were China (+ Asia buyer club) I'd hold buy-side LME ring-style forward physical auctions. Oil & dollar will fall together & commodities will follow
1690 2018-08-31 20:22:35 @GreenpeaceUK hi, your new video about Palm oil and orangutans blew my mind! Can you recommend a shampoo/body wash that doesn’t use palm oil? I’m struggling to find in my local shops. Thank you!
1691 2018-08-31 20:22:25 Cashier: “Would you like to donate a dollar for Cancer?”
Me: “No mam, I’m against it”

Blank staring ensues.
1692 2018-08-31 20:22:25 OK, what is oil/condensate shipping time from Texas to India or China/Japan ?

Is it over 3 weeks?
1693 2018-08-31 20:22:17 i’ve been using cuticle oil lately but i still get random hangnails(?) and its mostly on my thumbs
1694 2018-08-31 20:22:12 In my oil class, this guy named gauge is apparently our DJ for the class I’m so excited
1695 2018-08-31 20:22:07 Yes there is tanker traffic now. A different kind entirely than the huge tankers and there would be a great many more of these large tankers. There is a big difference between the barges and the huge oil tankers. Compare apples with apples.
1696 2018-08-31 20:22:03 News soon about GSX Camellia Oil very soon. Check back after the Holiday weekend. #skincare
1697 2018-08-31 20:22:01 Well, it was an assessment by HUD, which currently estimates each homeless person costs 40k grand a year already. They might consider savings from that into their cost analysis.

As for the oil subsidies. My source gives me bigger numbers, but 4 billion still puts a dent.
1698 2018-08-31 20:21:56 Wow @JustinTrudeau Energy East would look good now so at least we could shut that discounted oil off.  What a mess.
1699 2018-08-31 20:21:55 Thanks for writing about this! Enefit is an OIL SHALE project rather than "coal-shale" as this tweet indicates.
1700 2018-08-31 20:21:54 Jumper cables, motor oil, personal lubricant and a sign that says "No."

1709 2018-08-31 20:20:54 Okay. Thanks just wanting to make sure before I asked the oilers why I never got any compared to anyone else. All I got was a VIP invite for an oil kings game
1710 2018-08-31 20:20:51 If Canada was energy self sufficient it wouldn’t matter what the US did. Why don’t we have more refineries? Why is it impossible to get our oil to other markets? Why are we buying oil from oppressive regimes like Saudi Arabia? Trump? He’s a symptom.

1714 2018-08-31 20:20:38 Trapo ~ oil change
1715 2018-08-31 20:20:34 it's one of my favorite parables to preach on, especially with fellow religious. The connection between the vessel of oil and the indwelling praying Holy Spirit only struck me this time around. For today I only had a couple of lines scribbled in Italian, no tape (that I know of).
1716 2018-08-31 20:20:29 おはようございます・・・永眠してました
1717 2018-08-31 20:20:24 Wait, what?? I thought you just sold CBD oil.... I better investigate this further.
1718 2018-08-31 20:20:20 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
1719 2018-08-31 20:20:20 For 3 cents you can get 200 BBLs of production. If the USD was to do QE, oil in NZD would soar as USD/NZD bifurcates. The company is not out of the red very long, but if the #'s improve both next 2 qtr's its a good geology play outside of USA. (NZERF)

1723 2018-08-31 20:19:45 Big brother, the government broke while we still seek for more loans beyond what our own budget can raise. For who, and now we have even oil and more investments, still fuel going up, this guy is a joke,

1733 2018-08-31 20:18:31 Built in shipyards his party stole oil, lied about, colluded with tories to cover up for forty years enabling them to close them. How's that for a legacy?
1734 2018-08-31 20:18:28 La devaluación integra se va a precios de todo lo que el productor compra en insumos, incluido Gas Oil. En cambio, no le trasladan la suba a lo que cobra cuando vende. Se lo queda en parte el exportador. Ud vio subir la carne? Hace un año que no sube. No hay inflacion?
1735 2018-08-31 20:18:20 Religion - not Oil - is the main reason for war in the ME? You are clearly delusional. Religion has been the means of war not the reason you Buffon.

1739 2018-08-31 20:18:05 Real talk. 90% of the reason I finally got an oil change today was strictly so they’d fill my tires for me.
1740 2018-08-31 20:17:55 Argentina was doing fine until the USA interfered with crippling sanctions, and a CIA backed coup  was mobilized. The USA couldnt tolerate the oil industry being owned by the state.

1744 2018-08-31 20:17:18 You are wrong Craig! Lougheed wanted to ween central Canada off oil, using LNG instead . The first Trudeau (Pierre) refused because 'it would cost manufacturers too much  to convert.
1745 2018-08-31 20:17:12 I suffer with anxiety everyday and I have to say the CBD oil has really helped me! Give it a go, hope you're OK 
1746 2018-08-31 20:17:10 Finally got my oil change
1747 2018-08-31 20:17:05 I don't think our tax dollars should go towards subsidizing Amazon employees when that corporation makes $177 billion annually. Now how exactly would changing this make them a monopoly? The government did not make Rockefeller's Standard Oil a monopoly, they did it themselves.
1748 2018-08-31 20:16:47 New Zealand Energy Corp. 
Made a profit! 
Q2 the 2 quarter, the profit was $742,146 (2017 loss: $562,449), 

Average net daily production of 199 barrels of oil equivalent per day f
or the six months.

At $50,000 per flowing x 199 its a $10MM company.
With a 33MM Oil facility.

Being replaced is a silly threat.

Companies panicked about hemp destroying oil based market. They too were afraid of being replaced so instead of retooling for hemp they attacked and gave us the war on drugs.

1752 2018-08-31 20:16:22 Mr. Johnson, did I hear correctly near the end of the debate that you would prefer that oil not be subsidized? If you did indeed say that, I would very much like to hear more about that.

1761 2018-08-31 20:15:00 Looked up oil subsidies in Obama admin - # I got was $4.5 billion. Running some rough #'s, I come up with a $10+ billion to house current homeless per month at $500 per month.  I think it wouldn't work this way, but if you were creative, probably homelessness could be tackled.
1762 2018-08-31 20:14:48 Capitalaism doesnt exist in any pure form and it is as pure in supply management as it is in the oil, automotive, and tech industries. All have their policies and subsidies that allow them competative advantage.

1785 2018-08-31 20:10:43 Wow! Just wow!
1786 2018-08-31 20:10:43 اختار وخلص فرصة مش هتكرر

1788 2018-08-31 20:10:24 Tea tree oil has been life saving.
1789 2018-08-31 20:10:17 RT @LivingSafely: Ritz Original Crackers this September? Its top four ingredients are flour, soybean oil, sugar and cottonseed oil.

Manni/Petti take forever..

1792 2018-08-31 20:10:13 Dont remember the product,  but what about using the tsp of coconut oil pulling technique instead?
1793 2018-08-31 20:10:13 Before bed, try a gentle #ScalpMassage: 1-2 tbsps of lightly warmed coconut, almond, or olive oil. The scalp massage and oil will nourish your hair, relax your body, and stimulate circulation. Leave the oil on overnight if you can, or at least for an hr. Gently rinse w shampoo.
1794 2018-08-31 20:10:10 Gadaffi had ambitions to form an African central bank with its own gold standard also made the unfortunate mistake of nationalising Libyas oil reserves and providing his people with some of the best living standards in the world. However these were secondary to the goal of #PNAC
1795 2018-08-31 20:10:07 As Keynes said, making our own goods is a luxury we can afford. Tying our economy to the ROW for its own sake cannot be a good thing. A certain level of self-sufficiency prevents contagion. Trade is for bananas, coffee, and oil, if we cannot make it.

1797 2018-08-31 20:10:04 '18 Fed paper acknowledges 100bps rate shocks impact EM GDP growth by -0.8% after 3yrs (back loaded). EM becomes more vulnerability if CA deteriorates/inflation increases, which can pull fwd the effect by 4qtrs. Higher oil prices, LIBOR-OIS, DXY is poison for EM growth.
1798 2018-08-31 20:10:01 Of course it's the least I can do, is vegetable oil ok 
1799 2018-08-31 20:09:59 Cicely Tyson won the HAT competition  today hunny. This woman must be drinking castor oil, because she looks FANTASTIC!!!! Auntie Tyson looks no older than 35. I’m SHOOK!!!! #ArethaHomegoing

1801 2018-08-31 20:09:51 Mixed a bit of Interlude Perfume Oil with a bit of water and sprinkled all over my room. 

Glad.

1803 2018-08-31 20:09:43 Collar turned up big can of cooking oil on the floor. Large donner , no , I am now a Vegan! Just like Spock !
1804 2018-08-31 20:09:42 More likely that they got a nice bag of oil cash from azerbaijan
1805 2018-08-31 20:09:30 How much larger would the US trade surplus with Canada be, if oil was excluded? President Trump pushed for the Keystone Pipeline, so Canadian oil must have be needed, right?
1806 2018-08-31 20:09:22 Yeah...
1807 2018-08-31 20:09:08 okay so like the oil jumped and it landed on my hAND BDJSBXJBS but i’m fine now
1808 2018-08-31 20:08:59 You don’t understand, shorty!
Oil quantity and price make all the difference. Even the Trudeaus (pop & son)  tell you that!
1809 2018-08-31 20:08:27 Same person
1810 2018-08-31 20:08:19 Cut the meat a little... Just for getting the oil cooking the meat for inside
1811 2018-08-31 20:08:08 Yeah plus it’s drier now.. just use hella moisture. And oil helps detangle my hair cuz of the slip.
1812 2018-08-31 20:07:50 Same here. Even something as common as air/oil filters must be a bitch to come by.
1813 2018-08-31 20:07:47 people are stupid. the crew here didn't leave until the car underwent a full maintenance check, and they upgraded the computer stuff while they were at it, if I know that crew, They've got extra gas, oil, automatic transmission fluid, etc. so they were prepared
1814 2018-08-31 20:07:43 Yoga Fridays have me wanting to buy rosewood oil and fancy lululemon yoga clothes. What have I become 
1815 2018-08-31 20:07:35 This is the second time I’ve seen Tyler speak in this particular platform & I must say, I see a little oil. I also see that beard, .
1816 2018-08-31 20:07:30 They are going to spend the crude oil money

1818 2018-08-31 20:07:11 Make sure you’re just removing it with oil and warm water. You should be good
1819 2018-08-31 20:07:07 @tsleilwaututh Port of Vancouver sets a new record on the back of oil IMPORTS. I guess it's only ships carrying Canadian oil that are a danger, eh?
1820 2018-08-31 20:06:53 I ask only one question to ndtv for example you won one site how much cost increase 2004 to 2018 you discussion oil price high in NDA in upa is highest 86 petrol diesel   75 per liter what a nonsense talking people of India every thing well known stop foolish the people
1821 2018-08-31 20:06:52 Hell rules because you can do whatever you want there! Go to hell! Kill people! Burn shit! Fuck school! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
1822 2018-08-31 20:06:37 Yes, he’s always on high alert and outdoors has too much going on. He loves the patio but other than that he would shake and whine and have trouble breathing.  He's tried Training, CBD oil, thunder sleeves, now fluoxetine at a low dose.
1823 2018-08-31 20:06:29 Why would you put the lid on the fryer? It allows water to get into your oil, and thereby shortening the lifespan of the oil by breaking it down faster. Do not put the lid on the fryer while cooking.
1824 2018-08-31 20:06:20 Cooking oil 
1825 2018-08-31 20:06:18 Revive an old wig ——> combine Water & UNREFINED coconut oil in a large pot. Boil Wig for 10 to 20 mind. If there is old glue residue on the wig this will also help you remove it if you scrub it gently. Rinse with head & shoulders shampoo & airdry  enjoy 
1826 2018-08-31 20:06:17 I just woke up from a nap. Literally just got out of bed and I have to take my car in for an oil change. I look like a fucking wreck, but I don’t even give a shit. Nope. Not today.
1827 2018-08-31 20:06:16 I’d start drilling for oil.

1829 2018-08-31 20:06:05 how to stop global warming

1834 2018-08-31 20:05:45 Frank McKenna Deputy Chairman TD Bank told us on air Canada forfeited $117 billion over 10 years by selling our oil discounted to U.S. Has @JustinTrudeau once referenced this? McKenna is fmr Liberal Premier of N.B. & fmr CDN Ambassador to U.S.
1835 2018-08-31 20:05:30 There are several pillars to a bad diet. Grain, Sugar, Vegetable oil, Glyphosate, and Lectins.  Funny how our food is filled with ALL of them. #Health #HealthyLiving #diet #weightlosstransformation #keto #vegan #intermittentfasting #andshit
1836 2018-08-31 20:05:27 I wonder if I take my shoes off before my next keynote, can I get a little but if that oil on my words? #ArethaHomegoing

1839 2018-08-31 20:05:07 You can print out coupons from firestone, they usually have 19.99 oil change
1840 2018-08-31 20:05:00 What method of extractions are better to consume than other? Bho v co2 v Rick Simpson oil v rosin tech v iso v bubble hash .....
1841 2018-08-31 20:04:56 Then you be voting for socialist type policies that have failed many of our US Cities.  Careful what you wish for.  This country has not been this prosperous in a long time.
Plenty of gun laws out there, but since when do criminals abide by the law.  Beto selling you Snake Oil.
1842 2018-08-31 20:04:54 i hate olives but i love olive oil so much. easily in my top 5 oils of all time
1843 2018-08-31 20:04:32 1. Fox - did you know pollution from coal and oil kill people and increase our health care costs by trillions of dollars over time?  I am not a fan of extremely fast trains.  There should be cargo rail and passenger rail between Boston and Canada with many stops in New Hampshire.
1844 2018-08-31 20:04:28 Pick any mundane object from a real or fictional setting and change where it came from, then explain how the new origin works, and why.

For instance, candles are no longer made of beeswax.
They come from palm fibres and whale oil instead.
How and why this is is the fun of it. :y
1845 2018-08-31 20:04:21 That one's in the Constitution, not that we see people driving around with them much.
1846 2018-08-31 20:04:07 Oil money 
1847 2018-08-31 20:03:47 Fantasia got the oil. Plain and simple. #ArethaHomegoing
1848 2018-08-31 20:03:41 That was along with him, Clinton, Jackson, and Farrakhan all up front gawking at her too.  She probably went straight to the shower to get all the gross off when she got out of there.
1849 2018-08-31 20:03:19 Just record unemployment numbers, record economy, record oil exports, record stock market, great gdp numbers. Yeah but the guy doesn't know what he is doing. #qanon
1850 2018-08-31 20:03:12 @CrustyMTBiker has been experimenting with using a volume of oil in the air chamber instead of a spacer on his suntours for six months or so, if you can't get hold of any give him a prod & I'm sure he'd be happy to talk about it 
1851 2018-08-31 20:03:03 I hope you come to realize that you haven't stopped the oil from flowing. You have only helped ensure that it will travel by train, with higher ghgs, danger of spills and environmental damage. You have only succeeded in ensuring the things you claimed to be fighting against
1852 2018-08-31 20:03:03 Now you know you got oil when you have Min. Farrakhan is up on his feet while you’re squalling about Jesus! Sing @TasiasWord!

She got the oil.

1855 2018-08-31 20:02:41 Here we go again.

More death and destruction to a) steal oil and b) ensure that Israel remains top dog in the Middle East.

We live in a world ruled by psychopaths.
1856 2018-08-31 20:02:31 This is a very rare quality . You are not like hot groundnut oil like some people. 
1857 2018-08-31 20:02:30 Nearly bought a Ventora many many years ago, but a fluttering oil light at tick over put me off, didn't fancy the cost of a bottom end on the straight six.
1858 2018-08-31 20:02:27 Zlatan Ibrahimovic can mix water and oil.
1859 2018-08-31 20:02:21 when I say there ain't a voice with more oil than fantasia's. father gawd.
1860 2018-08-31 20:02:19 Ive had two unsuccessful showers cos this oil wont come out of my hair WTF
1861 2018-08-31 20:02:16 Honduras dumped a bunch of motor oil in el Salvador for not sharing water. 

This is not effective problem solving or trade #followers
1862 2018-08-31 20:02:13 a) Norway haven't joined & then tried to leave.
b) The population is 10th the size of the UK's, and they have a huge sovereign wealth fund for rainy days (when the oil runs out).
c) Norway is in the EEA, and has to abide by a whole load of EU rules, without having a say in them.
1863 2018-08-31 20:02:04 @jamieoliver Please please help a troubled cooker of pasta, hubbie says no olive oil in (dried) pasta when it’s cooking, I say yes - to prevent it sticking to the pan. He says it prolongs the cooking time and brings no benefit. I disagree. What’s the right way? Thankyou  
1864 2018-08-31 20:01:58 I reckon the most efficient are mica heaters but I’m concerned about the health risks. Not sure I want to be microwaved. Oil heaters seem to be cost efficient but they’re huge and ugly. Fan/convection heaters are expensive and noisy.
1865 2018-08-31 20:01:56 Every @RELEVANTpodcast episode is good for a laugh, but no episode has made me laugh out loud—at the office—as much as this Wednesday's eucalyptus essential oil fest.
1866 2018-08-31 20:01:46 Yes and if they want to shut down the oil sands we will stop the flow of money. With that gone those opposed better keep their hands in their pockets to keep Trudeau’s hands out.
1867 2018-08-31 20:01:44 If you wanna know what the oil is... Fantasia is it!
1868 2018-08-31 20:01:26 Now you know you got oil when you Min. Farrakhan is up on his feet while you’re squalling about Jesus!

1869 2018-08-31 20:01:26 Indeed, George. Well, Scotland could join the Eurogroup if they wish. As far as I know, the Scottish economy is in a good shape. Moreover, they could benefit of the oil in the North Sea. I will support them if they organise a new referendum on independence. 
1870 2018-08-31 20:01:20 @realDonaldTrump hi Sir, I'm frenchman and one of your fan and follower.  My background : French engineer, electrical, instrumentation & process control, 25 years of skill/experiment in energy, power plant, oil & gas, nuclear and petrochemical domains (construction, commissioning
1871 2018-08-31 20:01:08 Not if it's global. The US doesn't have the strongest economy and in fact you may have the biggest national debt. I think the world would survive nicely, the US has a dependency to feed it's citizens from imports, as well as oil.
1872 2018-08-31 20:01:08 Oil
1873 2018-08-31 20:01:00 Big jar of coconut oil in the bathroom med cabinet. Best lotion, hair conditioner ever. Have at it. Lol
1874 2018-08-31 20:01:00 Versus the foreign oil companies who own 71% our oilsands & send their lobbyists & negotiators to get our natural resources at discount prices (look at Norway & other countries royalties/taxes).
1875 2018-08-31 20:00:46 better not tell anyone I had my car's oil changed a Grease Monkey! OMG! Snowflakes...OMG...not the "M" word!
1876 2018-08-31 20:00:30 I wonder if motor oil was his first experiment in his balls. like maybe he did start w water, but the body reabsorbed. maybe motor oil was model T. maybe ppl are just shove shit into themselves all the times.
1877 2018-08-31 20:00:17 Ain't that the truth. Leaving it in the ground is the ideal situation if the rest of the world did as well. But realistically, we're gonna ship oil to international market so let's do that as safely & ecofriendly as possible.
1878 2018-08-31 20:00:12 Help me congratulate Chelsea Johnson!!! 

She is our winner this week. Chelsea you have won a free oil change and free car wash.
1879 2018-08-31 19:59:57 She is the reason Mitch won reelection. No choice really. She was bought and paid-for by DNC.
1880 2018-08-31 19:59:46 THE OIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1881 2018-08-31 19:59:40 ahhhh, thank you!!! I haven’t tried olive oil.

1885 2018-08-31 19:59:13 Do not use hair styling gels. Avoid applying heat to your hair. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Is it NISIM or NHB? A hair loss shampoo. or something? What must I do to unearth the official web page. An affordable gift. Where to find it?
1886 2018-08-31 19:59:09 What happens in countries like Venezuela where they can't export recycled motor oil to create diesel fuel ?
1887 2018-08-31 19:58:59 Fantasia brought the oil, took off her shoes because it is Holy Ground and has Mother Sis Shirley Caeser's approval on the altar...We are having CHURCH Ladies & Gentlemen #ArethaFranklinFuneral #ArethaHomegoing

1890 2018-08-31 19:58:42 No, it is if you understand the serious climate issues we are facing and can think about more than short-term oil profit for the betterment of humanity moving forward. This is not about partisan politics, this is about the future of the planet and humans on it.
1891 2018-08-31 19:58:40 After you change my oil !!!
1892 2018-08-31 19:58:39 Only I know the value of the oil that has in the vessel ...

1898 2018-08-31 19:58:03 Idk if McDonald’s used a diff type of oil to deep fry these nuggets but some ain’t right.. 
1899 2018-08-31 19:57:54 Fantasia came with the oil
1900 2018-08-31 19:57:52 Still buying oil with blood. The price is too high.
1901 2018-08-31 19:57:47 use tea tree oil , you’ll be surprised at how good it is

1903 2018-08-31 19:57:28 I’ve already been using extra virgin olive oil. 
1904 2018-08-31 19:57:05 coconut oil will solve all of your problems
1905 2018-08-31 19:56:52 .@Cathy_McLeod Are you suggesting in your statement on TMX that Alberta oil is the "cleanest, most ethical, environmentally-friendly energy in the world"? If so, please explain. #bcpoli #cdnpoli #TransMountain
1906 2018-08-31 19:56:41 Global Trade war btwn US n China's retaliatory import tariffs have also weakened d Rupee,Chinese yuan has fallen sharply,the Spurt n dollar outflow has pulled down Asian currencies,US is building pressure on its allies 2 stop buying oil frm Iran.

1907 2018-08-31 19:56:40 I have a friend that cured his dog’s cancer with CBD oil. So amazing!
1908 2018-08-31 19:56:39 Coconut oil is fuckin awful.
1909 2018-08-31 19:56:36 Are there any $25 oil changes??
1910 2018-08-31 19:56:32 I’ve always wanted a nose piercing  ... using tea tree oil for piercings is life tho!
1911 2018-08-31 19:56:29 From your readings of these results can you further elaborate on the source of this achievement in Non Oil Revenues?
1912 2018-08-31 19:56:11 but but but the Canadian economy will collapse if Alberta doesn't get it's oil sands pipeline ....
1913 2018-08-31 19:56:09 Lorrie is dead on - pipelines are a far safer and cleaner way to move oil. Just ask the ppl of Lac Megantic. These sanctimonious, virtue signalling clowns have already cost this country billions.
1914 2018-08-31 19:56:05 Come change my oil 
1915 2018-08-31 19:56:01 Ma'am I can smell the gel and oil sheen from here...
1916 2018-08-31 19:55:48 Or you could look at it differently. 

Are cons really trying to build a pipeline to tidewater? If we have one, we instantly break free of our beholden contract with US to sell cheap oil and only to them. 

Cons refused to consult meaningfully & messed up NEB findings. Hmmm
1917 2018-08-31 19:55:43 No its extra heavy crude, no fraccing involved.  Think Canadian Tar/oil Sands infrastructure.  Thousands of wells, pipelines, steam generation and refineries processing this, plus huge tailing ponds.  

This is pic is of low rate oil wells
1918 2018-08-31 19:55:42 If #DNVGL is involved then for the worse. DNV GL is #corrupt due to its #culture of #bullying, #harassment, & #discrimination.

1919 2018-08-31 19:55:34 Better than the scraps from Westminster's table any day even if there were no oil
1920 2018-08-31 19:55:23 You don't have to tell me. But the @GOP needs to understand that our planet does not belong to big oil or coal.
1921 2018-08-31 19:55:21 Me: I definitely need an oil change, but can you also give me an estimate on what else needs to be done?

Service Technician: Sure thing.

*enters numbers into calculator*

ST: A new car will cost approximately....

1924 2018-08-31 19:55:10 I've got like 30 fragrance oils from when I tried (and quickly gave up) making candles and bath bombs but I've got an oil burner that I can use them in so who's the asshole now?!
1925 2018-08-31 19:55:07 I just came for a oil change
1926 2018-08-31 19:55:05 Is there oil on there? Because the nc might want to liberate that continent
1927 2018-08-31 19:55:04 I think it was probably too close to the broiler, but I've had issues with this oven being heated up and creating a burnt odor before, just not this bad. The smell was definitely something beyond just meat or oil burning.
1928 2018-08-31 19:55:03 yea, it's great that it worked for them and I think its fair to tell people about it if helps but I can't help but think "snake oil salesman", and his fanbase is loyal enough to do it without any precaution. Her taking payment for advice is very fishy.
1929 2018-08-31 19:54:55 MPs use violence to impose their will on others. They steal our money. They tell us what substances we can and can't use. They tell us where we can or can't live and travel to. They murder brown people just to steal oil. 

But yeah, let's focus on some nasty tweets.
1930 2018-08-31 19:54:52 I'm sure Putin would like to see the price of oil skyrocket...and so would the Saudis...
Pure speculation of course
1931 2018-08-31 19:54:52 The cleanest, bestest, most special oil in the world is cheap garbage? Who knew?
1932 2018-08-31 19:54:52 have the pan warm-up to your desired temperature beforehand, use oil and try not to burn your house down
1933 2018-08-31 19:54:49 Keep a date with Destiny in our COVENANT SERVICE tomorrow, 1st September by 6.30am. It's  as we ORDER the ATMOSPHERE for the NEW MONTH! 
It will also be our Communion/Anointing Service, so come highly expectant with a bottle of olive oil. 
We anticipate your coming!
#BeyondLimits
1934 2018-08-31 19:54:47 You just don’t get it. We need to aggressively abandon fossil fuels and make a 180 switch to 100% renewables. Jobs lost in the oil and gas sector will at least partly be recouped by the jobs generated by the renewable energy sector.
1935 2018-08-31 19:54:41 The only winners are the legal boffins who plan to spin this out for every cent they can and of course our friends south of the 49th who will continue to enjoy cheap oil
1936 2018-08-31 19:53:51 Let's skip to the TLDR and just say nobody ever told me not to drip oregano oil directly onto my tongue.
1937 2018-08-31 19:53:34 Nigeria never believed in Nigerians though she believed much more in oil and gas in which he steals money
1938 2018-08-31 19:53:33 FFS ! are we going to allow ourselves to host that slime ? Well, if we do, I will get arrested. Let him peddle his snake oil elsewhere.
1939 2018-08-31 19:53:18 I'm really excited to do this hot oil treatment on my hair 
1940 2018-08-31 19:53:07 my aunt filled up my tank and bought me oil for my birthday she a real one (‘:
1941 2018-08-31 19:53:01 SAME Getting my oil changed and I know I’m being judged hard af right now.
1942 2018-08-31 19:53:00 Does anyone use CBD oil for their anxiety? Do you like it and is it worth it?
1943 2018-08-31 19:52:52 You know it’s going to be one of those days when...
1-it’s Friday of a long weekend
2-night staff (22:30 start)...stuck on the ground in Paris due to plane’s mechanical failure
3-evening staff (14:30 start)...spilled hot oil on her foot
4-you haven’t had coffee 
1944 2018-08-31 19:52:49 everybody and their momma getting damn oil changes today
1945 2018-08-31 19:52:44 The industry isn’t dying. Oil use is increasing 10%/year and will continue to do so until at least 2040. How is that a dying industry?
1946 2018-08-31 19:52:38 If I had a dollar for every time joeboy carter told me to check my oil I probably wouldn’t be stranded in eufaula al with a wedding cake. Ftw. Check your oil.  this is a pricey mistake.
1947 2018-08-31 19:52:37 1) Bring to room temperature first.
2) Use a lid to add a bit of convection.
3) Make sure whatever liquid fat (oil, butter, etc...) you're using goes on right before you put the food on the hot pan to prevent burning the fat itself.
1948 2018-08-31 19:52:31 The oil price crashed in 2014/15 and you know, as did papa Trudeau, Hydrocarbons are such a trivial part of our economy. Why would anyone buy a pipeline if it didn’t drive the economy. 
Noone uses massive deficits when the economy(oil) is up unless it’s to BUY vOTES. Buy buy bye
1949 2018-08-31 19:52:10 Snake oil salesmen?
1950 2018-08-31 19:52:05 I’m craving some greasy , oil dripping pizza 
1951 2018-08-31 19:52:02 $dig is a gold backed crypto. The petro dollar is dying, already countries no longer have to buy oil in US$ and this trend will only increase. USA loosing control
1952 2018-08-31 19:52:02 Trump and his supporters are delusional. 
He is a snake oil salesman as you suggest, but his non-thinking supporters keep buying the snake oil.
1953 2018-08-31 19:51:40 Hopefully the Trudeau Liberals will increase payments to activists, native bands, welfare cases, and “irregular” immigrants so they can buy our oil... cause there’s zero chance we’re going to extort any.
1954 2018-08-31 19:51:40 “Not a smidegon of corruption” says the guy who brewed it up in VATS. This guy could let lies roll off his forked tongue like a master of the art. I can’t WAIT for thr public to see what a snake oil salesman he really was.
1955 2018-08-31 19:51:19 The first 15 mins is on Krypton where Kal-El is an infant.

The following 15 mins is Clark saving men from an oil rig.

And a flashback to Clark saving kids from a drowning bus.

And Clark defending a waitress who’s being sexually harassed by a drunk.

And then Clark saves Lois
1956 2018-08-31 19:51:18 We used to use coal as a fallback when I was a child. Now it is electricity, oil and wood. We have lots of forests here. More trees than people. Spruce, fir, birch etc.
1957 2018-08-31 19:51:17 He and PALIN were actually AHEAD when the "OCTOBER SURPRISE" happened:
- Oil taken off the market, gas prices spiked (Farm eqpt, transport market)
- Corn taken off the market (Farm feed)
- LIBOR manip - banks froxze credit (many farms failed in OCT-NOV sparking junk bond fail)
1958 2018-08-31 19:51:15 Kilduf talking nonsense.. filling air time.. dude, go on vacation, there’s nothing going on in oil..
1959 2018-08-31 19:51:14 West Virginia never got better. #coal is not coming back. #whousescoal? My house is clean gas. Years ago my house had coal, but I don't want to care for a coal furnace. Trains use oil, #TrumpLies #Hardball #cnn
1960 2018-08-31 19:51:14 i'd love to party with Oil Can... back in the day.
1961 2018-08-31 19:51:00 Running errands with @sober_corgi truck needs registered and an oil change then it's wow time.
1962 2018-08-31 19:50:56 There are estimates that 16,000 babies die each year due to all the oil spills in Nigeria
1963 2018-08-31 19:50:48 Too bad he didn't take it one step further and say he'd give all oil $ 2 the people 2 eliminate poverty a la Venezuela.
1964 2018-08-31 19:50:08 Oil can Boyd interview with @DALLASBRADEN209 @pcon34 was awesome
1965 2018-08-31 19:50:07 Huge shout out to Iconic Signs, Chelsea’s, Lubrication Station Oil Change, and Bad Boy Graphix for your donations and support to Kaffie Middle School! Thank you for supporting our Kaffie Dolphins
1966 2018-08-31 19:49:51 If you stop the flow of oil from alberta and then stop site c, where will you get the electricity for your gasless car? To stop useing non renewable sources we need more renewable ones, right?
1967 2018-08-31 19:49:47 Who has the longer leash with the Oil, Chiarelli or McLellan
1968 2018-08-31 19:49:22 I'm currently sitting in my car getting an oil change all by myself.

I did my adulting. Let the long weekend of hiding from the world begin!
1969 2018-08-31 19:49:17 Dropped my car off to get detailed today and I find out I have an oil leak and will need a rental next week!:( I better be getting a Porsche to drive around!!
1970 2018-08-31 19:49:13 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…
1971 2018-08-31 19:49:12 #PentaNova Energy is at a 52 week low. Yes, is a long shot. But, with the Argentina Peso so low, a Oil prize could be the trigger to buy in Argentina portfolio comprises of KM8, La Mariposa, Llancanelo, and Sur Rio Deseado Este. Sur Rio could be $100MM asset by itself.
1972 2018-08-31 19:49:05 This is good to know. I am pretty sure I need an oil change tomorrow before I head out of town so if I do end up having to go in, I'll ask them about it.
1973 2018-08-31 19:48:56 Subsidy reduction was started by MMS... just check..
Modiji only increased the excise duty when international crude oil prices reduced.
Can you make a comparison between international crude oil prices and local prices over the years?
1974 2018-08-31 19:48:41 That interview with Oil Can, how he described picking up the phone with you guys, That was flippin cool.

1976 2018-08-31 19:48:38 The "slinky around the bird feeder pole" trick didn't work. Let's see how they like a pole covered in coconut oil. #petty #squirrels1humans0 #round2
1977 2018-08-31 19:48:22 she’s a pathologist so everything that gets removed has to go to pathology just bc of procedure, if it’s a tumor or a remote control. he wanted them to be bigger so I guess he was like okay gonna inject motor oil in there
1978 2018-08-31 19:48:18 Very true. But did you know the British abstained in the UN vote to create Israel. They didn't want to offend the Arab states as they realised they needed access to Arab oil.
1979 2018-08-31 19:48:15 But if I were Trump I’d toss this tweet out there to scramble Canadian domestic politics “Alberta you’re great, and have awesome oil reserves. We’d love for you to join the US as our 51st state. #AB51”
1980 2018-08-31 19:48:09 Clearly u know little about how oil sands oil is arrived at. It is not energy efficient, nor do any of our refineries refine the raw bitumen that comes out of the oil sands. U offer no alternative solutions.  But ur good at whining. Not a leadership trait though.
1981 2018-08-31 19:47:55 Lmao she likes new baby and peach poppy but we just realized none of them come in the perfume oil. Now she’s considering the urbandoll body oil
1982 2018-08-31 19:47:38 Bank of Canada no longer needs to raise rates,  Trudeau and his Liberals doing a great job on their own , killing jobs in the oil and Auto sector this month .  Next 12 months will be long and ardous for Trudeau in house of Commons #cdnpoli #Transcanadapipeline #NAFTA
1983 2018-08-31 19:47:25 my mother gave me a fish oil supplement and I broke it in half and swallowed the oil from it. don't ever do that if you like yourself.

Thanks for the laugh, tho.  

I’m sticking with @DrewForOklahoma bc he’s the only one with backbone enough  to stand up to the freeloading Oil & Gas Industry Wall St swamp. #RestoreGPTto7
1986 2018-08-31 19:47:01 Yeah I was hoping for real news like details of sanctions or something, not propaganda. Claiming Saudi Arabia caused oil prices to plummet to support the us (instead of to stifle rising US fracking and Iranian oil industries) is comically off
1987 2018-08-31 19:47:01 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Psalm 23:5
1988 2018-08-31 19:46:57 You don't strike a general and let him escape, he'll come back for you with a plan he'll never fail.
1989 2018-08-31 19:46:53 I used a quarter tank of gas in one day and I want an oil change now
1990 2018-08-31 19:46:47 my mom was talking to me about cbd oil yesterday
1991 2018-08-31 19:46:47 Wow it's rivetted! Wonder what kind of lock mechanisn it used.  What did they burn in those lanterns? Olive oil?
1992 2018-08-31 19:46:42 So the reason it’s this big deal is because In-n-out owner is known to be a moderate Democrat, the Irvine company it’s self is a corrupt corporation (fact). Oil/Gas companies and corporation who rely on people voting against gas taxes to raise revenue in the oil company favor
1993 2018-08-31 19:46:39 We now have oil. Why charge VAT on oil products while we have billions of oil gallons underground? @dailynation @NTVnewsroom @Ma3Route "CS Rotich"
1994 2018-08-31 19:46:38 Mana from Moi dix Mois called, she wants to wear a Final Fantasy codpiece for oil wrestlers.
1995 2018-08-31 19:46:37 Good skin day champa no oil no dullz
1996 2018-08-31 19:46:28 Same for my mom. The only thing she ever used was Oil of Olay or Ponds.
1997 2018-08-31 19:46:28 I disagree with my liberal friends on boycotting companies for donating to the the Republicans . Let's get them off the oil, Russian oligarch and NRA tit first.
1998 2018-08-31 19:46:24 The ancient Romans used ammonia (derived from urine) and fuller's earth (a clay which can absorb grease and oil) to clean their togas. 
1999 2018-08-31 19:46:21 Odisha #CM @Naveen_Odisha is famous to apply oil to those heads which ar well Oiled. #Unemployment, #Corruption, #Poverty of Commons accute.

2000 2018-08-31 19:46:14 #supportnotley. I totally support Rachel Notley in her demand for Ottawa to take steps to fix the oil situation. #Trudeau
2001 2018-08-31 19:46:13 Bad spin.  Sure the deficit is down.  Not because of what the NDP did. But because the price of oil went up.  The NDP spent $186 million more than budgeted.  #ableg #abpoli
2002 2018-08-31 19:46:07 @realDonaldTrump Was it a mistake to push for the Keystone Pipeline, given that you feel Canada has traded unfairly with the US? Will the US refuse Canadian Oil? Fwiw, I think Canada has been a good neighbor and trading partner.
2003 2018-08-31 19:46:06 @MoldyGames Hello there! I've been playing Idle Oil for ages and think I've reached the end of Unlimited mode. Literally, every property, CEO, tech, etc. is unlimited, including my current money and the experience on reset.
Wouldn't let me save and reset my game progress for me.

2007 2018-08-31 19:45:33 I would use my best tool fora deal.USA needs our oil and we supply 25% of the electricity to the eastern. Seaboard states.
Ask Lotus how he feels about a 25% ta
2008 2018-08-31 19:45:26 I assumed Texas' enduring conservativism had a lot to do with the businesses that exist there. A Latino person working in oil, ranching, or for business dependent on customers in those industries is likely to perceive the Republicans as better for him personally.
2009 2018-08-31 19:45:25 Oiled one

Don’t you even know what the word “Christ” means? So illiterate.

Christ - from the Greek Khristos - meaning “anointed one”

Anointed - meaning to cover in oil. 

You’re welcome.
2010 2018-08-31 19:45:16 Optimally they work together, true. I use a Full Spectrum Hemp Extract that is 65% CBD and my caregiver mixes it with THC oil for a 1:1 ratio. He just corrected me about CBD alone killing stuff. CBD derived from hemp < 0.3% THC IS legal in the US. Local laws vary, U can research.
2011 2018-08-31 19:45:12 And until we can ease our reliance on oil, how do you propose we ship it? Rail? No way!
2012 2018-08-31 19:45:09 You are snake oil in the human form.
2013 2018-08-31 19:45:08 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2014 2018-08-31 19:44:59 Bit of filler and some oil here and there she’ll be right 
2015 2018-08-31 19:44:55 Lemon+garlic+tahina+salt+chick peas. Olive oil, sumac & paprika optional. Anything else? Hummus heresy.

2019 2018-08-31 19:44:32 This is good to know. I have the work orders but the actual thermal-paper receipts are gone, and I need to send them in to the selling dealer for a couple oil changes since they lied about the 2-years free and told me they would pay me back (I'm holding my breath on that one).

2021 2018-08-31 19:44:27 With #Canada and the #US trade talks failing today and Trump continuing to say that Canada has been taking advantage of the US for years. There are a few things to remember. First and foremost, Canada is the most important foreign source of oil imports for the US. Thread:
2022 2018-08-31 19:44:26 This is why I change my oil myself.
2023 2018-08-31 19:44:21 Get a Keto Mojo, Joe. Also, are you taking MCT oil (C8)? That stuff really boosts your ketones and helps you stay in ketosis even if you eat a few too many carbs.
2024 2018-08-31 19:44:15 Your right, oil has 20 years left (max) which is why we needed to move quickly to secure our market share. Never going to happen now.
2025 2018-08-31 19:44:08 Meanwhile, soy and palm oil plantations are literally destroying forests.
2026 2018-08-31 19:44:02 And Neck Oil on draft! Unlucky!

It defys logic!

2041 2018-08-31 19:41:28 Ingesting properly made essential hemp oil can help with many health problems. Anybody can do in-depth research on this subject.
2042 2018-08-31 19:41:26 -2 fewer thd jobs. Businesses were leaving to go overseas due to high taxes and the difficulties of doing business here in the US. Manufacturing had left (supposedly for good), we couldn’t get our own oil (though we have more than the Middle East) bc If was cheaper to use theirs.
2043 2018-08-31 19:41:16 Well its definitely not the least... you should look into Nigerian oil
2044 2018-08-31 19:41:09 Canada is 1 of the larger free economies esp. on a per capita basis. and a good ally to the USA on many issues. top trading partner for your exports (and imports) for many states. reliable, now affordable oil, gas, wood, cars. on that basis, I'd say a friend.
2045 2018-08-31 19:41:05 @ChangeTheLAUSD HE WAS NOT IMPEACHED FOR SEX. He lied under oath. Doesn't matter if it was about changing the oil in his car, nuclear secrets, or BJ's. HE LIED UNDER OATH. Odd that you dems don't GAF he paid off Paula Jones, but think it's impeachable for someone else. #hypocrite
2046 2018-08-31 19:41:05 Im very sorry 2 hear this, i really understand cause i got lupus.  Its exhausting but cvd oil if u know good seller helps my nerves, maybe only the pain a tad.  May i ask whats wrong? Prayers for you

2052 2018-08-31 19:40:36 I don't understand this scrutiny of E. Musk. Only because he doesn't fit the formula of what a CEO should be like. I'd rather the media focus on CEOs of oil companies destroying the planet.

2059 2018-08-31 19:39:28 Fantastic creations!Great benefits from coconut oil
2060 2018-08-31 19:39:28 What I think most people don't understand is why not build the pipeline? We all use fossil fuels and the oil is going to be transported one way or the other so why not help out?
2061 2018-08-31 19:39:21 She has the rhythm of a Sherman tank that ran out of oil about two weeks prior.

2071 2018-08-31 19:37:48 My hair is literally drenched in oil and leave in conditioner. I refuse to let this color break my hair off this time

2073 2018-08-31 19:37:33 I would go if I didn’t have to work for nothing more than debating some of your platform issues like Medicaid for all, all day school. Where’s this $ going to come from? And who can afford it after you destroy our oil and gas industry?

2076 2018-08-31 19:37:13 Reducing the deficit has been tough,  a bit like stopping an oil tanker, it takes time. However it is reducing and will hopefully soon be in surplus and paying down the debt.
2077 2018-08-31 19:37:13 BS to THC oil causing those effects?  I’m not agreeing, I only ask bc I heard a story on the radio about a prison in Western PA where they did a lockdown bc of what could have been a wide exposure to K2.  Not that THC oil and K2 are the same.
2078 2018-08-31 19:37:05 Lexie says she'll take 5 mins in the shower and it's like 30 minutes later.. I'm gonna put baby oil on the floor in 2.5 seconds
2079 2018-08-31 19:36:57 the deadliest slip and slide has been created with over 50 bottles of dish wash and oil which will be the battleground for today's match
2080 2018-08-31 19:36:50 Say mane sometimes when you in the moment you gotta do what you have to that spit can be the best lube. If I gotta get the baby oil hell we might as well have four play and that ain’t me especially when I’m just trying to bust a couple and dip out.
2081 2018-08-31 19:36:19 Nigeria concentrated on oil at the expense of everything else. It also accounts for almost a third of capital flight from Africa.

#Nigeria should be one of the food baskets of Africa but it is not. 

Africa needs Nigeria to be successful. Please pull your socks up!
2082 2018-08-31 19:36:17 I'm there.....Day #1..... 2 elected Senators, 1st & 2nd amendment rights, NO more transfer payments, runaway 3rd world immigration as a means to import Liberal voters, impediments to oil market, beef disputes, or ridiculous Canadian levels federal regulation

2085 2018-08-31 19:35:46 Ronald Isley didn't have the oil.
2086 2018-08-31 19:35:46 We are so screwed.  
Canada’s oil sector is in serious peril with oil selling at a massive discount

We cannot build pipelines 

We have trouble getting approval for new mines

We cannot get NAFTA signed

Our Automotive sector has tariff eyes on it.
At least we have a MJ Industry
2087 2018-08-31 19:35:44 The will forever control our oil pricing & climate change strategy without the new replacement line. Not to mention there still remains IN MY BACKYARD, a 65 year old line!!!!!!!!!! We need a better plan, I agree. But handing everything to the  is wrong.
2088 2018-08-31 19:35:42 2) An italian firm 'bribed' UG PM Amama Mbabazi for rights to a UG oil field.

M7: I gave the deal to China “If Mbabazi ate that bribe, He ate it for nothing... I’m not saying that he did!”

Nebanda: “You don’t seem so sure!”

M7: “That young girl, has got bad ideas in her head.”
2089 2018-08-31 19:35:35 Look what we have now-Trump's admin shrinking Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante NP for oil & mining leases; opening ANWR to oil drilling plus offshore drilling; gutting environmental regs for clean air, soil, water; slapping tariffs on solar panels that hurt the industry..
2090 2018-08-31 19:35:35 Ok its lunch time and I'm about to eat wontons with chili oil so it's hot take time.

Shaquem Griffin has not looked bad, but I have not been impressed to the same extent as a lot of y'all seem to be.
2091 2018-08-31 19:35:35 It's so good. Really captures my essence like a perfect oil painting.
2092 2018-08-31 19:35:31 Couldn’t you argue that Alberta and Saskatchewan are saving the climate by not moving the oil to the West coast. So stick your carbon tax where the sun doesn’t shine.
2093 2018-08-31 19:35:27 Filled up my car, got an oil change & washed it cost me $100 #Adulting
2094 2018-08-31 19:35:26 That's 60%ish IRR in my book.  FWIW operators at Enercom last week mentioned $15mm AFEs, recalling the Bakken at $100 oil!

2096 2018-08-31 19:35:12 Can't blame ya, I just need something that isn't tonkotsu, getting too old for all that oil, haha.
2097 2018-08-31 19:35:10 1) A day before UG MP Cerinah Nebanda died in dec 2012, M7 told parliameny that some MPs were working for foreign interests.

Some MNC's competing for deals in UG’s oil industry were said to have bribed state officials. Nebanda & other MP's were drafting oil transparency laws.

2100 2018-08-31 19:34:42 What an essence-heavy conclusion that led to rupee tumble and even resulted into global crude oil price rise, in the same breath? 
2101 2018-08-31 19:34:30 The @Valvoline on 2nd Street in Xenia has the nicest guys working here! Always so pleasant- I hate getting my oil changed because I’m awkward but they are great!

2107 2018-08-31 19:33:48 Oil production in a currency that is higher/lower than USD is going to make for very interesting times soon. The set-up is playing out now, the differentials are widening making room for error on spec trades between light/heavy near 70/35 range.

2110 2018-08-31 19:33:12 Oh, we know what the mobster in the white house thinks of us.  Shut off his supply of Canadian crude oil!
2111 2018-08-31 19:32:47 Sick and tired of hearing about Canada’s filthy oil sands when the world needs to embrace renewables.
2112 2018-08-31 19:32:37 is a privilege to be meet with one of the top managing director of chevron oil and gas company here in France, working with him is a great achievement and experience to learn from.
2113 2018-08-31 19:32:32 It's not the cleanest and most ethical source of oil in the world ?  Ya ok
2114 2018-08-31 19:32:30 I understand this struggle very well my ex tried everything y’all we used kerosene,fuel,spirit,weed, even baby oil nothing came out @BrunoMars am happy for you with this mustache the sky is ur limit 
2115 2018-08-31 19:32:22 Lol...what really caused the crash of 2008? Credit defaults? See you don't know. Try 150 / barrel oil! Will oil cause it this time? No..this time it will be more complex. All comes down to.."do you have what it takes to keep S Show going?" if yes S show goes on..if no..S hits fan

2122 2018-08-31 19:30:49 Rex Murphy is 100% correct. In fact,  Alberta should withdraw from Canada and function as a separate entity. No more being a punching bag for the rest of Canada. We should no longer  sell or ship oil to any part of Canada. Let them buy foreign, that is their preference anyway.
2123 2018-08-31 19:30:43 $TRCH is this, uh, is it gonna, was there? Did I see? Damn,  nope, nothing. Maybe next time. Good thing for $VKTXW & $TPIV LOL #biotech #oil

2126 2018-08-31 19:30:31 So Trump says that when he negotiates with Canada, all he has to do is show a picture of a Chevy Impala because they are built in Canada. Well all we have to do is show a picture of a barrel of oil, because we are the Untied States biggest supplier

2128 2018-08-31 19:30:18 If and when you get hands on a PicoStill could you document and talk about the Hop Oil process? Thinking that could be really interesting.

2130 2018-08-31 19:30:06 Try making anything out of steel in the oil industry. At 2.75% interest, and 25% tariffs, the cost of $100 Million is now 28% higher. Existing oil facilities are going to fetch a premium now, as replacement costs are much higher. #TagOil may be undervalued due to steel tariffs.

2135 2018-08-31 19:29:28 Waiting at tire town getting my oil changed but jeez either these chairs are so comfy or I just had a really rough day.
2136 2018-08-31 19:29:14 @GenChuckYeager I am a 35 yr GM Auto tech. Always appreciated your affiliation with AC Delco and enjoyed the commercials. Best one I saw was on a gag reel where you were skeet shooting "competitors" oil filters  Thank you for your service Sir. Blessings.
2137 2018-08-31 19:29:13 Nuclear is not renewable, we reached peak oil roughly 10 years ago and you haven't factored in the widespread conflicts that will erupt as resources dwindle. A major catastrophe and we bicker about whether or not corporations can make a profit.

We won't make it to 2100 I reckon.
2138 2018-08-31 19:29:12 They are sucking oil out from under our land. That is an act to respond with a military action.

2143 2018-08-31 19:28:38 They should commission a study on the effects of the long term use of body oil on the brain.
2144 2018-08-31 19:28:24 I went to get an oil change, and there was a poster advertising a community theater show. It said: “‘I became insane, with long intervals of horrible sanity.’ –Edgar Allan Poe” Next to the name, someone had added in pen: “–George” hahaha ya got burnt, George
2145 2018-08-31 19:28:22 @dr_Botanicals Hey, have you discontinued your Moroccan rose facial oil? 
2146 2018-08-31 19:28:08 Not when the govt sabotages negotiations by constantly poking the bear for anti trump votes.... we just lost oil, cant afford to loose auto. see @manny_ottawa's long thread that had been calling it as it happens
2147 2018-08-31 19:28:01 Just applied daily moisturiser on my face instead of night oil. I mean what do I need to do now? Wash my face again? I’m honestly disgusted.
2148 2018-08-31 19:28:00 This one is a fave! It’s Beauty Counter #3 Balance + Charcoal! A little goes a long way! My@friend is a rep if you’re interested in placing an order! They also have this Balancing Oil that is TO DIE FOR! I use it 2x a week for utterly perfect moisture!

2152 2018-08-31 19:27:17 I put too much oil and beef in my pasta sauce. Then I ate it with too much spaghetti. Then I drank a glass of wine too fast. Now my heart hurts. 
2153 2018-08-31 19:27:07 The US has a surplus with Canada and Canada sells its oil to the US at a HUGE discount to world prices. Canada should put a tariff on Trump's bullshit.
2154 2018-08-31 19:26:59 So I drop my car off yesterday as my side mirror came off. I got a call today saying that it's going to be $750 to replace it and not the mirror. They also looked at the AC and that's going to be $1750 to fix and I need a new tire. So much for a quick oil change...
2155 2018-08-31 19:26:58 With my anxiety at a rise.. Looks like I’ll be back on CBD oil
2156 2018-08-31 19:26:31 It goes against all my cooking instincts (anything can always tolerate more fat) but again and again, I am forced to admit that if you want really nice, attractive pancakes, you should use as close to no oil as possible. The echo of oil.
2157 2018-08-31 19:26:28 Director: This Wesson oil trapeze orgy scene feels a little boring. Get me Jefferson Decapitation Meditation Fatburger immediately!
2158 2018-08-31 19:26:27 I sell organic oil for skin/ hair care nd organic black soap very affordable.pls RT nd patronise thanks.
2159 2018-08-31 19:26:24 New Zealand Energy once trading at $2.14 bought a $33 Million Oil handling facility. The price of the shares are now $0.03. The cash market cap value is 1/3 what they paid for Waihapa. The new steel Tariffs make this facility worth $40 Million. Bargain at 3 cents?
2160 2018-08-31 19:26:21 Oil change time!
2161 2018-08-31 19:26:14 Pour some oil on the ledge
2162 2018-08-31 19:26:03 Its obvious the government in Alberta doesn't care about the environment. Its all about the oil revenue... someone spark a new industry in that province already so they can get over it
2163 2018-08-31 19:25:56 Iraq sells its oil @$77 
2164 2018-08-31 19:25:49 all climate scientists and camp fantastic! not extremist but Big Oil is. dont want us come home with piece of paper signed by "Hitler" as Chamberlain did before Churchill called it POS.

When I tell people that their eyes glaze over and they mumble some BS about dirty oil.
Others just say "too f---ing bad, pony up"
Maddening!
2168 2018-08-31 19:25:29 Watch your cooking oil intake, a word is enough for the wise.
2169 2018-08-31 19:25:08 Bruschetta technically speaking is bread and oil. Modern versions add garlic and tomatoes. Cheese kinda detracts from the whole point of it being "poor food"
2170 2018-08-31 19:25:00 The US exported more than 66-million barrels of crude oil in June, says EIA in the Petroleum Supply Monthly. This figure was as low as 52,000 barrels per month as recently as 2002. But this record will be broken and blistered in the next 3 years.
2171 2018-08-31 19:24:59 i need a full tank of gas, a car wash, my oil changed, & my inspection sticker 
2172 2018-08-31 19:24:51 Why tf are oil changes even a thing??!??? Like who came up with that???
2173 2018-08-31 19:24:43 I did tried this once in Navratri but without ginger and corriander but the puris was soaking too much oil . We could not eat such oily it was a mess . Any tip on that plz even absorbent paper was useless
2174 2018-08-31 19:24:42 President Trump, islamic regime allow Chinese to fishing in Persian gulf.
I think it is a distraction for oil exports to China.
They use fishing ships for Oil exports.
They want to Circumvent the sanctions.

2175 2018-08-31 19:24:14 No chance Treasury/Fed driving down commodity prices w HFT, unlimited money, above the Law status & no Uptick Rule w their Army of traders?  It saves an astronomical amount of $$ in refinancing cost as well as COLA. Throws farmers, miners, oil producers, investors under the bus.

2177 2018-08-31 19:23:59 She gets over 1.5k a month on patreon, exactly how much expenses does she have. Gold shower curtains perhaps? how does one who gets money from her book, 1.5k a month in patreon and nearly 100k run out of money without handing in a product. Stop excusing snake oil merchants.
2178 2018-08-31 19:23:46 Heard news re their Oil could be anytime soon - and guesstimate re timeline?
2179 2018-08-31 19:23:44 Lazy or dishonest characterizes much or all of the nonsense coming out of Alberta regarding First Nations in BC. To them, it's all about *their* oil and anyone opposed should get the hell out of their way.
2180 2018-08-31 19:23:34 Face oil is the best damn thing 
2181 2018-08-31 19:23:21 If I wanted to keep a government who was captured by the oil industry I would have voted PC in 2015. Pipelines aren't diversification.
2182 2018-08-31 19:23:05 Got my oil changed at Jiffy Lube and when I get back in my car the volume is on 25 blaring country music 
2183 2018-08-31 19:23:01 You always have to keep an eye on essential oil people
2184 2018-08-31 19:23:00 US oil production would probably be an interesting digression, but what's so awful about Labour policy? ....or more specifically, what "damage" do you think a Labour government could do in five years?

A few nationalisations and a crackdown on tax avoidance wouldn't be so bad.
2185 2018-08-31 19:23:00 I just wanna cook for her & rub her body down w/ some coconut oil
2186 2018-08-31 19:22:53 @maro254 You know what format looks fun to play? Legacy. To bad I am not an oil tycoon.
2187 2018-08-31 19:22:51 "By every possible metric"? Have you heard of Google? Enter question - what is the dirtiest oil in the world? First answer - Alberta oil
2188 2018-08-31 19:22:49 Of course it does; most Albertans understand this. But more tanker traffic is more tanker traffic regardless of oil composition.
2189 2018-08-31 19:22:48 Okay, so “They make money off this, so they’re lying.” Is that what you’re saying? 
If so, WHY DON’T YOU THINK THE OIL COMPANIES ARE LYING?
2190 2018-08-31 19:22:40 Just took a 45 minute nap while I'm getting my oil changed. Nobody else is in here, how are they still not done?

2192 2018-08-31 19:22:38 I have been to an actual shop 4 times in the 2 years since I started. I do it myself and hardly own any products. Olive oil and air , bih  And my hair is course. 
2193 2018-08-31 19:22:24 I think he meant it was the cleanest most ethical source of oil and gas in the world.
2194 2018-08-31 19:22:17 I told this dude I work for an oil company and he thought I was out there pumping the oil and shit lmaoooo
2195 2018-08-31 19:21:59 @realDonaldTrump if it's rising in price, it's temporary and prices will soon be down. Everything is ready, and by November 4, Iran will not be able to export even a barrel of oil. The bloodiest diet of the present world has reached its last months, and Satan is failing
2196 2018-08-31 19:21:56 Excuse me if I am cynical about Twitters attempts to police itself. Thats like telling Exxon to start policing oil tankers.
2197 2018-08-31 19:21:39 I ate so much food at indepaint literally like I didn’t care that food was everything  oil down doubles and roti

2199 2018-08-31 19:21:26 Please post video of you making the required face for shaking null oil. Is the same face also for Agrax or is that different?
2200 2018-08-31 19:21:25 @realDonaldTrump If global oil reaches $ 100,then Iran's oil boycott is worth it,since it will definitely end the biggest contributor to terrorism,so worth it.Of course,I know that the price of oil will not go up much,because Saudi Arabia,Libya,and Russia are taking Iran's oil
2201 2018-08-31 19:21:23 You don’t get it. Complaining but yet you use oil every single day. I’m not pro oil, but I’m sure as heck realistic. Our society is not ready to be anti-oil. Where do you think Canada get’s it’s wealth from?????
2202 2018-08-31 19:21:19 Also I really hate the 'well you participate in this economy so don't complain'. It's a cheap shot, and makes people feel paralyzed in hypocrisy. We can all make small changes and sacrifices to expedite our getting off of oil.

2204 2018-08-31 19:21:10 Did you know most processed foods contain either palm oil or corn syrup? The objective is to block lechitin - so your body never knows it's done eating. 75% raw, vegan organic is the way to health. #GOVEGAN
2205 2018-08-31 19:21:01 Now awaiting explanations as to how we will grow as an exporting nation. And how high oil prices will accelerate alternative energy. And how demonetisation is a long term bonanza etc etc
These doubters. Tchah
2206 2018-08-31 19:20:59 Why does it take 2 hours for someone to change your oil 
2207 2018-08-31 19:20:55 The thing is, sending 30-50 year old airplanes around the sky on a tight schedule is extremely difficult and expensive. When oil prices rise, airlines can either raise ticket prices, raise the cost of "extras" like checked luggage, or go bankrupt, as many have.
2208 2018-08-31 19:20:44 Tiny man like Trump has the ECONOMY SMOKIN', JOB KILLING REGULATIONS IN THE TRASH CAN,mining, oil, Nat gas industries so good USA IS NOW A MAJOR EXPORTER OF GAS AND OIL...Ford, Volvo, Toyota, Apple expanding in USA, many other corps C omming back, NAFTA re-negotiated, MAGA!!!

2210 2018-08-31 19:20:30 Shayad usne edible coconut oil use nahi kiya hoga,koi purana oil use kiya hoga
2211 2018-08-31 19:20:29 Could really go for some of that Italian restaurant bread that you dip in herbs & olive oil rn
2212 2018-08-31 19:20:13 I learned people in #SouthDakota don’t like wind turbines because “they’re ugly”…
So,Linda,wanna know what is also ugly.
Black lung in coal miners.

Oil slick on beaches,lakes,rivers,etc

Buying bottled water because the groundwater you depended on is contaminated by fracking NG
2213 2018-08-31 19:19:41 I don't understand it tbh.

How is it beneficial to score political points showing the last two governments have failed in the consultation process? This is against the National interest

If you're against importing Saudi Oil but cheering that the Liberals failed.. #ableg #abpoli
2214 2018-08-31 19:19:28 Thats who i don't use the internet or watch movies anymore liberal trash. I watch Fox News and read the old  Sports Illustrateds I steal  me when I change my oil. MAGA
2215 2018-08-31 19:19:27 Is it because Mueller's investigation is exposing Trump's criminality? How about Trump's treasonous activities with laundering 1 billion in Russian money through his properties? Better yet can we discuss how he sold American natural resources to Russia in Artic oil? Look it up Al
2216 2018-08-31 19:19:21 If people would put as much effort in learning how to paint as they do trying to contour their face, we’d have some great artists in this decade. @KylieJenner would crush an oil painting portrait #contour #artist #artists #portrait

2226 2018-08-31 19:18:35 Brought my car to get a oil change and they finding all kinda extra shit wrong 
2227 2018-08-31 19:18:32 What?  If it's advertised as CBD oil then that's probably all that's in it. If you want THC, get an oil with THC in it.
2228 2018-08-31 19:18:30 We had a palm oil spillage down off the coast of #northwales about 3 months a go .

2232 2018-08-31 19:17:55 & I do want to brag about the oil change I just got (all inclusive)  I went from spending $84 to $42 now $27. I’ll never spend over $30 again!

From hacked up trees & shrubs to oil spills & piles of trash. Who will compensate US for having to clean up after them?!

2238 2018-08-31 19:17:31 You mean “Needless Markup”
2239 2018-08-31 19:17:27 OK, as a test, let's cut off ALL oil shipped to BC either from Ab. or from foreign countries. How long before we hear a change in tune from FN and from environmentalists?  How's the horse and buggy, to transport food,  working for you ?
2240 2018-08-31 19:17:27 And I hope we will also drive the conversation around government intervention in waste management. Akwa Ibom is an oil producing state with huge allocations and a manageable population. Citizens don't have to suffer to have a clean environment. Well done!!!

2242 2018-08-31 19:17:15 Not to mention the dozens of oil tankers each day heading down the B.C. coast to the lower 48 that are never mentioned or protested.

2253 2018-08-31 19:16:00 Why does everyone in Transformers looks like if there put some extra oil on them?
2254 2018-08-31 19:15:57 ...down to fully reveal her breasts, she dribbled some oil onto each of them before massaging it into them. Using slow, deliberate strokes she played with her nipples some more inbetween giving her chest a thorough massage. This too made her even more wet and she was in danger...
2255 2018-08-31 19:15:56 You can doubt but the cost of transporting pol to the east would have made it much more expensive than imported oil. Refiners would not have bought it. Alberta has 8 refineries...that are not running at capacity now. Why build another?
2256 2018-08-31 19:15:44 Please stop where is Rob Isley Chaka didn’t bring no oil! NONE!

2258 2018-08-31 19:15:23 Most of the reduction in 2015 was the result of the completion of a lot of oil-sands mega-projects. There is usually a gap between the end of such projects and then the commencement of new ones. The mid-2014 plummet in oil prices resulted in the reduction in capex globally.
2259 2018-08-31 19:15:21 his forecast is betting on oil price go up, without the pipeline, there is nowhere to sell.

2311 2018-08-31 19:08:43 @narendramodi Time has come to reduce/remove 122% excise duty on crude oil which your govt. had increased when crude oil prices were low and give some relief to common people. You are getting free petrol diesel and not common people. Take some action to reduce inflation
2312 2018-08-31 19:08:38 Car says it needs and oil change and I leave for Chicago right after work. Will my car explode? Find out one the next episode of DragonBall Z
2313 2018-08-31 19:08:33 Technically, he's not wrong, as long as you read what he wrote literally. By buying the pipeline, Trudeau has failed to champion any of these much cleaner alternatives to tarsands oil.
2314 2018-08-31 19:08:30 @Google They should be forced to split, just like Standard Oil! Of course, then there are those corrupt politicians. Hypocrites in Silicon Valley, they'd sell their own mother for a buck!
2315 2018-08-31 19:08:19 What’s Thieves Oil?
2316 2018-08-31 19:08:05 So it's better and cheaper to send that oil by train through major cities and neighborhoods. Or should we just keep buying Saudi blood oil
2317 2018-08-31 19:07:34 More and more it's looking like Donald ran for president to escape penalties if ever caught.  

N looks like the GOP has been bought ... by somebody.  Big oil always owned them, but I've never seen Big Oil force them to bend over and recite "I'm a little piggy" before.
2318 2018-08-31 19:07:34 Dang the hot oil really splashed on my hand 
2319 2018-08-31 19:07:22 You would rather buy oil from the Saudis and drill into and wreck one of your most beautiful states than play nice with your peaceful neighbours to the north?  Well, I think you might need to set your priorities straight. Canada is not the enemy here.  Your President is.
2320 2018-08-31 19:07:06 Oil and gas are NOT renewables! Get an education!
2321 2018-08-31 19:06:59 @NissanKenya hello..bought bluebird sylphy. Planning to do service. Which type of  engine oil is recommended?
2322 2018-08-31 19:06:37 진짜..나는..어떡함..?
2323 2018-08-31 19:06:20 Rediculous.  The air in the oil sands area is excellent.  You are a making a fool of yourself parroting the green misinformation.  And you never take holidays or bc ferries or public transport either I’m sure...
2324 2018-08-31 19:06:16 Parlay that with the over on the number of washes it takes to get  rose oil and glitter out of a UofL shirt.

2329 2018-08-31 19:05:17 Its ya boy lil vocabulary here to teach you the fundamentals of an oil change.
2330 2018-08-31 19:05:12 It sickens me and I can't stand fake people like the Kardashians and feel sorry for people that worship and buy the snake oil they sell, society is in the shitter because of all this reality TV and self promoters and people that are famous for being famous.
2331 2018-08-31 19:04:59 dilbit?  But BC can't do without oil.  Since it will either come in or go out of BC waters the Province will have to make a choice of whether it supports Canada or the Saudis, or Venezuela.
2332 2018-08-31 19:04:49 Jiffy lube. $75 for $20 worth of oil is likely a large enough tip.
2333 2018-08-31 19:04:46 Seriously so who here on my Facebook has not tried CBD OIL yet?!!
2334 2018-08-31 19:04:42 We will be needing palm oil too
2335 2018-08-31 19:04:37 Is it normal to go through an entire pack of oil absorbing sheets in one sitting? Asking for a friend :))
2336 2018-08-31 19:04:29 Castor oil is a god send.

2339 2018-08-31 19:04:07 It’s just the way Libersls like it. Shut down oil completely and they can look like climate heros  on world stage

2342 2018-08-31 19:04:00 There is never to much oil 
2343 2018-08-31 19:03:50 @JustinTrudeau When you said we can't rely on the US in the future as a buyer for 90% of our oil you were 100% correct. must sell that cause even the native and conservationist will understand that or i hope so. keep it up.

2345 2018-08-31 19:03:34 I had to wait hour & a half for my car to get an oil change & a reg checkup but I did not mind it kind at all because they had the US open on
2346 2018-08-31 19:03:31 Расизм какой-то
2347 2018-08-31 19:03:27 Wait...did you just call oil extracted from the Alberta Tar Sands “the cleanest, most ethical, environmentally-friendly energy”? Seriously? Bro, weed’s not legal until October. You’re baiting out your scene Boss.
2348 2018-08-31 19:03:24 he tries to talk like he's a big mob boss so I think cement shoes and swimming with the fishes or maybe an old oil drum down with the fishes would be more fitting
2349 2018-08-31 19:03:23 Gun oil
2350 2018-08-31 19:03:18 We'll never be economically independent of the USA. It's just that we haven't been made to wonder whether we can trust the USA not to hurt us intentionally and selfishly in more than a century. What do we do to retaliate in the worst case? Close the border and shut off the oil?
2351 2018-08-31 19:03:18 Rub both sides with olive oil and half an Oxo each side...or try a 1/4 to test it. Rub it in well
2352 2018-08-31 19:03:00 I stand corrected on cancer curing. Listen, I don't oppose examining this avenue, and I hope I can heal myself eating meat (I'm a staunch carnivore) but as long as there is _no_ evidence this works, this is snake oil. Affirmations need evidence.
2353 2018-08-31 19:02:48 Don't forget NHRA at Lucas Oil Raceway Park, & the F1 Gran Premio di Italia from Monza.
2354 2018-08-31 19:02:42 groups where the line was going to run... were generally not supportive. She knew that. And again, where is the cleanup plan? Bitumen is not oil, it does not float.. it sinks... The court correctly pointed out the problems that the people were rightly complaining about.
2355 2018-08-31 19:02:39 it does indeed....recipes for dinner that is, not for afterwards!
2356 2018-08-31 19:02:28 We should talk more about the consequences of not having oil. Where would the money come from to pay for Medicare and other social benefits?
2357 2018-08-31 19:02:27 Went in for an oil change and left with a new car 
2358 2018-08-31 19:02:21 1960 ive always been dubious about israel even when i was a kid i thought hmmm phoney american accents etc Its a place that shocks me to the core.  The middle east would be a different place if they werent swimming in oil.

2362 2018-08-31 19:01:36 Ive heard it does switch sides so after 6 months you get the other piercing done. And you’re never ever supposed to take it out otherwise it’s void.   Lavender helps me.. or peppermint oil on the temples.  I hope you find some relief..
2363 2018-08-31 19:00:59 Yup, work putty well to get oil mixed in, thin layer as you said (also do it on wood too) then use tape to help keep glass from moving, I’d putty long sides first then top and bottom, once both sides tidied up and skin on putty paint to stop putty drying out & breaking

2382 2018-08-31 18:59:28 thats implying USA has control over the price of oil worldwide which just isnt true

2385 2018-08-31 18:58:31 Bald-faced lie. "Reform" ONLY benefits oil companies. At EPA, Pruitt reduced #RFS by 2.75 billion gallons & gas prices went UP from $2.25/gal to $2.98! #Ethanol costs 90 cents LESS than gas today. Refiners want #RFS killed so they don't have to compete w/inexpensive ethanol

2408 2018-08-31 18:56:32 Not only do we have oil, we have hash brownies and pot cookies. But remember, driving under the influence is a Criminal Code Offence, so please consume only after you are home.
2409 2018-08-31 18:56:25 I do enjoy a bit of oil on most roast vegetables. And salt and various herbs and spices. Sometimes a squirt of lemon. I hope to get the opportunity to cook you breakfast in the not too distant future :-)
2410 2018-08-31 18:56:23 This govt is proving over and over again that they can’t handle the responsibility of the job.  Everyone is exporting oil except Canada.  But we’re sure importing it all! And trekking it across the country by rail. Smart. @JustinTrudeau @gmbutts
2411 2018-08-31 18:56:20 U.S. oil futures fall, but gain for the week and month
2412 2018-08-31 18:56:08 But Alberta holding BC's tourism and marine based economy hostage just to ship more oil can never be justified either
2413 2018-08-31 18:56:05 Is that a Gulf of Mexico oil rig ?
2414 2018-08-31 18:55:49 Yes, it does, Thereby assisting in keeping oil prices high and transferring the meager wealth of poor people in developing countries to Saudi Arabia.

2424 2018-08-31 18:54:54 's ok, Donald, Canada doesn't need the US as much as you need us.

And, have a nice impeachment.

2447 2018-08-31 18:52:30 Today's news - FP: "Tide of investment set to recede from oilpatch amid more pipeline delays"; In the WSJ: "The Oil Export Boom: Houston-Galveston exports exceed imports for the first time." That sadly says it all. We desperately need to get serious and turn things around.

2455 2018-08-31 18:51:42 So riddle me this Genius: how does truck and rail transport: 1. have lower carbon footprint than a pipeline?  2. reduce tanker traffic if/when oil and gas transport increases? 3. lessen competition for transport overland for other export products that can't be shipped via pipe?
2456 2018-08-31 18:51:39 You & I are on the same page it seems. I voted for JT because of his climate change stance and alleged concern about pipelines. Things have changed since then leading me to think he has been brainwashed by big oil.

Or is it blackmailed? Hard to know for sure but something is off

2459 2018-08-31 18:51:32 It's funny now that Kenya is exporting oil that fuel has become more expensive than ever! Now wait for the chain reaction, its gonna be devastating. Thank y'all for supporting Jubilee Govt . #Tanotena #kumirakumira How do you feel now???? *Grabbing popcorns*

2507 2018-08-31 18:47:10 Also there is a carbon footprint on extracting oil and delivering fuel the cfp of delivering Electricity is much much less ev carbon footprint is a thing but much less than fuel cars even if you charge with 30% coal
2508 2018-08-31 18:47:06 Labour has combined nationalision of industry with the extremes of green party policy. Not content with nationalising energy companies they want to shut down power stattions and ban onshore oil and gas. Jeremy Corbyn has also promised to shut down nuclear industry.
2509 2018-08-31 18:47:03 Exactly the way MMS UPA and Modi NDA dealt with crude oil and petrol prices.

2514 2018-08-31 18:46:27 of course not. oil and gas will be around for a long time, just lower demand.

we'll definitely use a lot less of it for heating and transportation. 

the fossil fuel industry is dying...

2518 2018-08-31 18:45:58 @JustinTrudeau, have to say I agree with you on this one.  I live along the railway tracks and there are a lot of train cars carrying things like oil that we are not aware of.  Also, when I look at this, the number of truck/train accidents related to anything the pipeline could..
2519 2018-08-31 18:45:54 Yikes! Here's a tip for getting that tape off a little bit smoother: Try saturating the tape in a household oil like olive oil or baby oil for a few minutes to loosen the adhesive.
2520 2018-08-31 18:45:54 As BC burns and the environment minister warns that climate change will effect our water, Trudeau mindlessly stays the course having capitulated to the oil industry.

2565 2018-08-31 18:40:57 I don’t know what we can do to play hardball. Our pipelines aren’t happening. Maybe withhold oil via KeystoneXL but that won’t do anything. Cut off softwood lumber or syrup? Useless. I think we were sending freshwater down to the States...?

2568 2018-08-31 18:40:47 Nothing wrong with olive oil.  It has its useful properties. However, to selectively promote it, no reason to punish coconut.  The proof is in the pudding. I have friends in Italy who are 100% sold on the benefits of coconut oil.

2581 2018-08-31 18:39:54 Bruh I’ve been waiting on my oil change since 9am
2582 2018-08-31 18:39:05 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
2583 2018-08-31 18:38:51 Your car be riding like it’s brand new after you get an oil change lol
2584 2018-08-31 18:38:51 I’m bored getting my oil changed send me your best memes
2585 2018-08-31 18:38:48 Irony is where a Country discovers that it has an oil well, then drills plus even starts exporting it, But instead of the cost of living going down it significanty increases even for the Pump prices. That's Kenya for you.  16%Vat @ntvkenya @MarkMasai
2586 2018-08-31 18:38:47 おはよ
2587 2018-08-31 18:38:41 Roster expanding need someone to hold Kapler’s coconut oil
2588 2018-08-31 18:38:33 Bishop Ellis got that head shinny must be that new oil...
2589 2018-08-31 18:38:28 Well, trolls are coming out of the woodwork. I'm going out to the Rockin' Jump with the kids.  All you doctors, generals and oil working chiefs will have to find another woman. Hint...Learn English & how to spell. But your still going to get Blocked! 
2590 2018-08-31 18:38:27 Anointed singing is more than a riff and a run. There’s a certain release given trough a psalmist who has had the oil PRESSED out of them! Don’t yearn for the gift if you aren’t willing to live through the pressing!
2591 2018-08-31 18:38:16 I hate going to auto repair shops , you go for a simple oil change next thing you know your radiator broke , all your tires need replacement , the cooling fans for your AC don't work right , you need a fuel injection . BRUH I was just driving my car fine Wym.
2592 2018-08-31 18:38:12 Dey referred to us as the land of Oil & Music. Now the Oil done is just Music?  "forever and ever dancehall cyar spoil" 
2593 2018-08-31 18:38:08 Tea tree oil!!! It dried it out
2594 2018-08-31 18:38:08 Pastor Shirley and Tasha Cobb wanted to have church. They got the oil.

2597 2018-08-31 18:38:03 Can you bring hot oil from there as I think it is very famous over there 
2598 2018-08-31 18:38:00 Texas is one of the biggest producer of wind energy, so the oil has to go somewhere
2599 2018-08-31 18:37:56 There was a a difference between cold pressed raw Coconut soul and refined version without Lauric Acid. This Professor needs to educate herself and/or stop looking after the Seed Oil Industry
2600 2018-08-31 18:37:46 Not fighting someone who's soaking peanut oil.
2601 2018-08-31 18:37:43 Your argument dies when you refuse to acknowledge the benefit of reducing the global reliance on oil that is produced w/o strict regulation. We should be doing our part to lead and impact change on a global scale, and it starts with cleaner oil, but does not end there.
2602 2018-08-31 18:37:35 The story on fuel hike is not well covered, tell us the current global oil prices & Pump prices across all East Africa countries vs what is projected to happen in Kenya #FridayNight @citizentvkenya
2603 2018-08-31 18:37:21 Ya’ll gotta understand something. Some singers have oil for certain songs. The old school saints have a certain oil in these old songs because they LIVED what they sang about.
2604 2018-08-31 18:37:19 If you cherry pick the currencies, you can show that even Venezuela did better
 It is tied to your oil dependency and fraction of your economy that is exposed to it.
2605 2018-08-31 18:37:10 go back to 1999 with the state of the country wrecked by military (inc. Obj's & Buhari's btw) govts and civilian admins alike - before the record increase in oil prices. It becomes apparent that Obj was actually a VERY successful President. Tbf nw probs cropped up under his admin
2606 2018-08-31 18:37:07 Mr Black oil...

2611 2018-08-31 18:36:39 Disgruntled nursing home employees travel to North Dakota oil boom country, where they unknowingly release flesh-possessing demons.
2612 2018-08-31 18:36:37 I'm bringing over the baby oil.
2613 2018-08-31 18:36:36 One Meal A Day. Which is dinner. Fish/meat and vegetables loaded with butter, ghee or olive oil! 
2614 2018-08-31 18:36:31 motor oil isnt for drinking
2615 2018-08-31 18:36:19 A blossoming facial mask, earthy blue, with concord grape, rosewood oil, and exfoliating sparkles. It's a a minty-smelling gel in a bottle.
2616 2018-08-31 18:35:59 It is very troubling that you believe Canadian oil is above criticism
2617 2018-08-31 18:35:56 It’s school fees month next month, i don’t have kids but I already feel exhausted. May God continue to Oil the account of every parent 
2618 2018-08-31 18:35:50 Hum,  wonder what her kids are like?
2619 2018-08-31 18:35:48 I’ll give you all the chili you can eat & a coupon for a free oil change if you will talk smack about my fellow chili cook off competitors.
2620 2018-08-31 18:35:44 On my way back to the office from a — very short — lunch break I saw a man, probably late 20s, early 30s, riding his bike with a yard sign sticking out of his backpack. The sign read, “I am Colorado Oil & Gas.” #copolitics
2621 2018-08-31 18:35:44 LED are more efficient and save energy. Presumably under Brexit we’ll be back to oil lamps and chimney sweeps ? #BrexitShambles
2622 2018-08-31 18:35:41 You said “amazingly anointed” and invite. Sometimes the oil fades. 

Ok bye.
2623 2018-08-31 18:35:30 Forget clothing discounts, where are the half-off oil changes? The 30%, 40%, 50% discounts??
2624 2018-08-31 18:35:28 She looks like the Tin Man in need of oil.

2627 2018-08-31 18:35:22 All the oils I use to grow my hair is essential oil, coconut oil, olive oil and castor oil
2628 2018-08-31 18:35:15 I just want one that works to curtail crime. My son sometimes works near the border on oil rigs. Rigs have security everywhere, but the ones on the border have tall fences adorned with barbed wire because of the illegals.
2629 2018-08-31 18:35:12 There are soooooo many ways to troll Canada on the issue of trade. Trudeau isn't being smart. I like one of the comments below, we should build an oil pipeline to them but zig zag it through like 7 states so they can all charge for it. 
2630 2018-08-31 18:34:50 Thank you for contradicting yourself.  Global factors impact oil prices not who is president.
2631 2018-08-31 18:34:42 I put everything except coconut oil! (I’m allergic) I practically drowned in rose water lol. I have an aloe & cucumber mask I put on and it’s helping cool it down
2632 2018-08-31 18:34:38 I'll bet if you buy a Bug, they come to your house and night and change the oil every six weeks.
2633 2018-08-31 18:34:24 Ugh... my other pt had similar diet and thought swirling a heaping spoonful of coconut oil in coffee w cream would have miracle health benefits.
2634 2018-08-31 18:34:15 coconut oil is THAT girl
2635 2018-08-31 18:34:10 Is there a gender-confused term for "What a pile of horseshit"?
2636 2018-08-31 18:34:08 Loved the fake crying and greased hair, comb-over bald spot. Pulling out his hankie and wiping “tear” from his eye was a nice touch. Like most politicians, this guy is pure sleaze. Snake oil salesman.
2637 2018-08-31 18:34:00 Mediterranean food in general is cool. I'm not a fan of italian, at least our version of italian, but there's a lot of commonalities between spanish, greek, turkish, lebanese, north african cuisine, pretty sure. one of them is olive oil.
2638 2018-08-31 18:34:00 334
2639 2018-08-31 18:33:56 Future husband, pls handle all the car stuff for me such as tires, oil change, car wash, etc etc. because I hate doing this stuff.
2640 2018-08-31 18:33:53 Palm oil too sir
2641 2018-08-31 18:33:51 try not to mix them. roseship oil in the morning and fresh herb serum at night.
2642 2018-08-31 18:33:50 You do realize it's buying an already built pipeline that actually passes oil through it, don't you? Such a weak argument from #WeakAndy.
2643 2018-08-31 18:33:27 Need to order some new oil for my bathroom diffuser. Need fragrance recommendations.
2644 2018-08-31 18:33:24 Hoooooo wee I'm always changing my oil myself from now. They out here treating me like a blonde baby.
2645 2018-08-31 18:33:06 The guy what does my oil changes has a day spa in the back of his shop. 10 bucks a brow.
2646 2018-08-31 18:33:04 PSA: I’ve been washing my face / removing my makeup at night with sweet almond oil and a little bit of lavender essential oil and my skin is GLOWING and so soft!!!
2647 2018-08-31 18:32:57 Will you be using any of your uplifting statements from the past?

“Lyin’ Ted”

“he’s a pussy”

"a little bit of a maniac"

“But I understand if oil pays him a lot of money, he’s gotta be for oil.”

“frankly like a little bit of a maniac”

“Goldman Sachs Owns Him”
2648 2018-08-31 18:32:53 they have no clue coconut oil has been a part of the healthy med diet for at least 5000 years
2649 2018-08-31 18:32:53 Eucerin oil control spf 50+ for my face and Nivea protect & moisture spf 50+ for my body...I usually mix it in with my body cream

2653 2018-08-31 18:32:26 You know what is sick? Not finding out the true stories and explanations that go with the sensationalized pictures that get your blood pumping. It is sick to take the word of people like Alex Jones who is really just a snake oil salesman.
2654 2018-08-31 18:32:22 #Cholesterol/oil is used in the #absorption of #proteins. You need cholesterol

2662 2018-08-31 18:31:29 awsome dogs, but get oil or something on its furr yer screwed 
2663 2018-08-31 18:31:21 In addition, the polling is impacted by millions spent by the oil industry, Harper government and now Trudeau and Notley inundating is with ad campaigns that falsely argue that pipelines are essential to a strong economy.

2665 2018-08-31 18:31:07 @pepboysauto I understand you guys are busy today, however it should not take 5 hrs to get a car in for an oil change and brake pads when dealing with a corporate account.
2666 2018-08-31 18:31:05 it’s an ass of oil on the ground on these ports, should i  hit em wit the slip n fall ?

2668 2018-08-31 18:30:54 The data is clear, coconut oil is not poison. Why would it go unchallenged.
2669 2018-08-31 18:30:49 Просто включить капоп
2670 2018-08-31 18:30:42 @zionoil so ive lost 70% of my investment so far, and you send me a letter offering me to buy more at a 5/1 and future ability to buy more. Yall defiantly have balls for sure. No oil, but balls. Honor my original for 1 buck a piece and well talk.
2671 2018-08-31 18:30:38 oh skin tips: put tea tree oil on zits and pimples that are starting or leaving! also aztec healing clay mask will instantly clear your skin! i swear by both of these.
2672 2018-08-31 18:30:38 Hydro could not be transmitted distributed or maintained without oil.
2673 2018-08-31 18:30:34 Pastor Shirley got that oil
2674 2018-08-31 18:30:25 Preach Shirley..... ::looks for my prayer cloth and oil::
2675 2018-08-31 18:30:19 Seriously?  There are many global factors go into oil prices.  No “president” is directly responsible but go anywhere in the world and at any point in time we have always had the cheapest gas with almost no exceptions.
2676 2018-08-31 18:30:11 why i hate eating outside is ...Even when you tell them oil kam rkhna h ..  Ruko sir kitchen ne 5litre ka oil jar naya aaya h aapki dish me daalta hu.

2678 2018-08-31 18:29:55 Here comes the oil! #ArethaHomegoing #PastorCeasargonnatakeushome
2679 2018-08-31 18:29:54 True, but we don't have the machinery to clean it up into crude oil. 
Why would the government be the sole exporter thus taking all the returns from it and yet cannot source "considerable importation funds" to help control the sky-rocketed prices per barrel nationally.

2684 2018-08-31 18:29:28 Castor oil use krain. Band nhi hogi 
2685 2018-08-31 18:29:18 I guess you miss the point. If US does great, It is going to outperform everyone in the world, not just India.  Also, oil price rises did not affect US because of strength of US oil industry.
2686 2018-08-31 18:29:12 Word is - Putin likes oil rubbed on his bald head too. 
Maybe you should ask your president for some tips. 
2687 2018-08-31 18:29:11 The oil is in the place!!! Come on Pastor Shirley Caesar!!!!
2688 2018-08-31 18:29:04 As you know that depends how you ask the questions. It’s not just an “expansion” it’s a new pipeline. In addition if you poll oil tankers the opposition goes up significantly.  The whole idea of the “balance” ignores our climate reality.
2689 2018-08-31 18:28:55 Oh we about to have church for real now with Auntie Shirley up there. She’s got allllll the oil.

2704 2018-08-31 18:27:35 Depends what metrics you use. Every form of energy production has pros and cons, though this is often forgotten as we seem only to dwell on the pros of "green energy" and the cons of oil.
2705 2018-08-31 18:27:35 Cheers. NOW STOP HATING THE OIL SANDS 
2706 2018-08-31 18:27:30 >implying sobrassada is fat-free
Oh boy. My mom likes heating sobrassada in the oven or pan and it lets out this chorizo-coloured oil. You need to try it if you can find it. It has a soft texture, harder than meat spread but way softer than chorizo.
2707 2018-08-31 18:27:23 I don't think so honey, I thought you meant acne scarring. For that try Tamanu oil its good for scars
2708 2018-08-31 18:27:18 @TheoFleury14                            So, looks like the liberals have converted the canadian taxpayers to oil pipeline investors. I can’t wait for the first shareholders meeting to get the ROI from Morneau.

2715 2018-08-31 18:26:43 Real talk, the tribute concert needed some of this oil. They just saved it all up for #TheFune. #ArethaHomegoing

As for the bought and paid for part, "yes", it's accurate.

2718 2018-08-31 18:26:31 Who are YOU funded by? 

How does moving oil and gas wells closer to occupied dwellings "protect Colorado"?
2719 2018-08-31 18:26:05 I hope that Albertans are smart enough to know that before she accidentally became our premier @RachelNotley was opposed to pipelines, including TMX. Its only now that she knows she's screwed in the next election that she's suddenly a champion or our oil industry.

2722 2018-08-31 18:25:49 As a spiritual scientist my concern and observation is that many may not know how to use the plant properly, how long or how to consume it; one can consume it by powder, oil, spray, scent, etc. There are many factors also, sex, karma, sign, etc that many don't factor...

2726 2018-08-31 18:25:22 That is what we expected lakini hio mali niya Brits, instead of Turkana demanding the oil itself, they cry out for driver jobs, ushenzi aki. Billions of cash are given to counties lakini natives there nikama hawajui nkt! Turkana should be the richest part of EAC
2727 2018-08-31 18:25:04 Have you ever noticed that everything on or in your truck seems to work better after an oil change? Brakes stop you faster, engine runs smoother, A/C blows colder, radio is more crystal clear, and the windows even seem to roll up and down more efficiently.

2729 2018-08-31 18:24:54 Captured by the Oil Deep State same as the NEB. Now cheerleading for Tar and reciting CAPP spin.
2730 2018-08-31 18:24:48 Sure we are one strong united country, Quebec opposed Energy East Pipeline to access and buying oil from country like Saudi but not from Alberta. Albertans are unemployed since years!
Do you still think Alberta should contribute for unfair equalization?
2731 2018-08-31 18:24:42 American's don't know meaning of Socialism
Socialism is when Canada just paid $4.5 billion for an oil pipeline
  
Healthcare is not socialism.
Socialism: social and economic doctrine that calls for public rather than private ownership or control of property and natural resources
2732 2018-08-31 18:24:23 The firemen of @FCDFRS told me SUPER IMPORTANT TO HAVE OIL!
2733 2018-08-31 18:23:54 She can sing but the oil is missing. #ArethaHomegoing
2734 2018-08-31 18:23:52 Although oil sales are continuing, but with these sanctions and continuing to rise in price, we feel the Iranian rial everywhere. How does oil sales affect people when they are worried about food and medicine?
2735 2018-08-31 18:23:45 Who was supposed to repay oil debt of billion to Iran... Thumara mummy!?
2736 2018-08-31 18:23:44 Price of synthetic oil went up so now my oil change is $69 dollars?! What is this garbage lol
2737 2018-08-31 18:23:44 At the Toyota dealership for an oil change...found a Manitoba plate with a Jets insignia 
2738 2018-08-31 18:23:41 China and Russia are paving the way to make a rail, And superhighway between each other. This also means resources like oil, And gas will be piped along this route.
2739 2018-08-31 18:23:34 This is the Canaan after handshake. Rise in cost of living, more debt, revisiting the judiciary, disobedience of the rule of law, Exporting oil and increasing the price locally. Kenyans price of democracy. 16% VAT.
2740 2018-08-31 18:23:30 I won’t have oil until Monday starting today omggggg yes
2741 2018-08-31 18:23:23 Lengthy caution for oil cleanup on track should be about done 
2742 2018-08-31 18:23:17 I drink about 7 cups a day and I add coconut oil butter and cinnamon. Coffee is good for you, so forget about the monthly studies about coffee.

2745 2018-08-31 18:22:35 If you don't like oil and gas feel free to stop using it.
2746 2018-08-31 18:22:35 Hey Don the Con, ever stop to think about how your 3rd grade reading level 5th avenue snake oil sales pitch sounds to us? Ignorant to anyone with an ounce of integrity. You will be stopped by a blue monsoon. You and bat boy had best get ready for the incoming shit storm.
2747 2018-08-31 18:22:30 U have no knowledge of oil obviously ....u seem to lack so much in so many respects

2749 2018-08-31 18:22:08 “The motor blew up and that was it,” McMurray said. “It was shaking violently. There were four or five gallons of oil sitting on the race track.”
2750 2018-08-31 18:22:04 Slice the oil in the batter.
2751 2018-08-31 18:21:48 Reading is important. Please do that before you try to get another initiative on the ballot. Maybe one that isn’t legally flawed this time.
2752 2018-08-31 18:21:45 You guys should BOTH know that what is extracted from Alberta Tar Sands is not even oil & not crude, it is bitumen which needs toxic chemical additives & heat to even make it pump through pipe. Maybe the best AFTER refining! Stop about pipelines and get building our own refinery!
2753 2018-08-31 18:21:40 If Gowdas have oil wells let them pump. the only have money tanks.
2754 2018-08-31 18:21:36 Dig into those liberals at oil companies and their feeling of censorship please
2755 2018-08-31 18:21:35 Talk of Irony, 'Irony is where a country discovers that it has an oil well, then drills plus even starts exporting it, but instead of the cost of living going down it significantly increases even for the Pump price' that's Kenya for you.'
2756 2018-08-31 18:21:32 I got eagle oil
2757 2018-08-31 18:21:29 Oil under the radar, market price $40.00 barrel........move it out of middle East, sell back through Commodities contracts.

2758 2018-08-31 18:21:26 @RachelNotley I guess killing endangered species means nothing to you as long as you get re-elected and get your oil money. That's a good look.
2759 2018-08-31 18:21:26 Lovely fresh bread and olive oil and the olives would paired nicely

2762 2018-08-31 18:21:12 Solar and wind is way more expensive for the same production of energy. I took away “the ethical transport of oil” I’d take a monitored pipeline over rail and truck all day. Climate change by humans is only a small portion of the change. Please review cycles of the earth and sun
2763 2018-08-31 18:21:11 Serious Eats brines chicken thighs in pickle juice, breads them with a spice enhanced flour mixture and fried in 350 oil. It’s delicious and I’d buy five or ten of them. Go Gay Chicken Heist!!

2769 2018-08-31 18:20:34 This is why I have stopped buying your products: 'Nestlé, Mars and Hershey have been accused of breaking pledges to stop using “conflict palm oil” from deforested Indonesian jungles, just days before the annual Halloween confectionery frenzy' (guardian,'17).

2771 2018-08-31 18:20:29 So I’m getting my car inspected they better not fail me cause i need a oil change lmao

2774 2018-08-31 18:20:08 @RahulGandhi  dear sir I would just like to ask for you to debate with the present govt by why  oil price are raising in India as the present govt told one India one tax
Second one is promised 15 lakhs still not received
What about black money which they promised back
2775 2018-08-31 18:20:04 Been waiting for 2 cars in front of me to get an oil change at the @WoodmansFood39 G&L center and it’s been an hour and ten minutes. This is a joke.
2776 2018-08-31 18:20:02 You know that commercial with dawn dish soap when they wash the oil off the ducks and otters. Where can I sign up?
2777 2018-08-31 18:20:00 Let's try to follow the logic of @JustinTrudeau climate plan.

2779 2018-08-31 18:19:34 I learned by doing, so sadly not at the moment. I really do suggest games workshop's brand of washes, they are excellent. Maybe nuln oil for metal and general use, brown for leather/cloth/general use, & green if you will have lots more orcs or whatever (or other relevant color)
2780 2018-08-31 18:19:31 Not crazy about how things turned out (shame the NEB, Tories, and Liberals made such a mess of the application/approval process), but is it possible there are other priorities that matter besides oil profits? Just as an idea to consider?
2781 2018-08-31 18:19:28 You call the Shah a puppet regime because he opened up Iran to the world and try to develop an industrialized oil market? Ask women how much they enjoyed living in Iran before Khomeni and the ayatollahs took over in 79...now you’re an anti-Semite and a sexist.

2814 2018-08-31 18:15:35 The oil industry is the most subsidized energy industry in the US.

They receive BILLIONS in fed and state subsidies.

What's your point?
2815 2018-08-31 18:15:31 Yes, I do have #AppsurdCats who are rescues. Sphynx cats love human companionship. Their breed is described as monkey, dog & child. Think about that. They need a bath every week because no fur to absorb oil. They need human, blanket, heating pad windowsill Cat TV is a bonus.

2821 2018-08-31 18:15:02 I guess they thought I was going to pitch them snake oil or something.

2823 2018-08-31 18:14:40 @TheGolem_ The answers lie in the US sanctions placed on the country.  An oil rich country facing an embargo and pressure against the leadership from the US for selling oil through a nationalized company rather than private?  Unbelievable eh? #Venezuela #Iran #Iraq #Syria #Libya
2824 2018-08-31 18:14:38 To say an independent Scotland "should be " a full EU member and qualify that by saying "absolutely and emphatically yes" is as clear as it can be! Given our resources (not just oil) the "could be" is best answered by EU which has stated it will welcome Indy Scotland!

2828 2018-08-31 18:14:25 I want pipelines, because we produce the oil with the best standards in the world. Thank god for Canadian Oil. Don't buy your oil from Saudi Arabia, Angola, Nigeria, Iraq or Algeria like Quebec does.
2829 2018-08-31 18:14:13 Funny how @RachelNotley now champions oil&gas over the health of Albertans #cdnpoli #abpoli
2830 2018-08-31 18:13:56 if weed is too much but you still want the benefits, they have CBD oil that you can smoke, take in a pill or bake into food and it offers most if not all of the benefits of marijuana without getting you high
2831 2018-08-31 18:13:33 @MichaelSmyth_ you also have not explored the sizes of these one-a-day oil tankers.  Many times larger than a ferry, with many tons more of oil carried. Our harbour is busy, congested with little manoeuvring room. One accident would be catastrophic
2832 2018-08-31 18:13:13 Most #Oil and #Gas companies rely on paper-based systems to keep track of products. Get ahead of the game, save time with Infochip.

2834 2018-08-31 18:13:08 We aren’t even getting world pricing for our oil ? All the pipelines are getting squeezed lack of transportation,decreases in investment. You should know Alberta is the biggest contributor to the nations economy stagnant Alberta = stagnant Canada. We’ve done 1300 homes here btw

2846 2018-08-31 18:11:37 I do worry about the mental state of british nationalists.
Their world view is that Scotland is and must be dependant on the benevolence of the UK to survive.
Forget Brexit, the suppression of oil wealth or hobbling of Holyrood, they're desperate to sink with them. Masochistic.
2847 2018-08-31 18:11:34 well unless you like to walk and dont want to be cold or  you dont need Canada, we supply 98% of your oil so good luck with that. "United States is the top importer of Canadian petroleum oil. The United States imports $38.9 billion usd worth of oil per year and imports 98.05% "

2850 2018-08-31 18:11:24 Try some thing cold like frozen peas or hot water bottle filled with cold water & in fridge. Move it around head & neck. Also Vick or Olbas oil.
They say the more tabs taken it worsen it. Good luck.
2851 2018-08-31 18:11:16 Not as damaging as importing oil from Saudi Arabia, Angola, Nigeria, Iraq & Algeria, which have no interest in environmental & human rights & of which Quebec currently does. Our oil is produced with environmental standards which are the best in the world.
2852 2018-08-31 18:11:07 no need to sell the oil at turkana, we just refine it and use it within our boundaries
2853 2018-08-31 18:11:06 I always wait till my oil is fuckn black to do my oil change. I bet the mechanic I always go to thinks I’m a crack head :/

2859 2018-08-31 18:10:40 That’s a great fight 2-4 years ago so I trust it is still today, happily watch that. I hope Chael beats him and no one watches as I imagine Sonnen is banking on viewers paying to see him get pummelled. As much as I love the snake oil salesman. Tom - forgot to say

2865 2018-08-31 18:09:57 The gallon that is being referred to is oil.
2866 2018-08-31 18:09:55 Why are fuel prices low in the international market, while Kenya is exporting oil but fuel prices are expected to rise due to 16 /º VAT. Cartels should stop exploiting us @WaihigaMwaura #FridayNight
2867 2018-08-31 18:09:47 Jojoba oil. Grape seed oil. Coconut oil. Peppermint oil. The possibilities are endless.
2868 2018-08-31 18:09:44 You know a pastor like Aretha’s dad (Rev. C.L. Franklin) had clout when they just went by their initials. It stood out like names seen on an oil tanker or tractor trailer. #ArethaHomegoing
2869 2018-08-31 18:09:38 A war seen as motivated by commerce would face severe legitimacy problems, as Iraq War suffered from mere perception that it was blood for oil
2870 2018-08-31 18:09:26 Indianans have a $25 million clean up bill to pay thanks to the failed Pence family oil business. They will probably cry for federal $$ but the EPA is AWOL under Pouting POTUS - with Pence’s collusion.

2882 2018-08-31 18:08:04 As a Canadian I would rather have no deal with the US than a one-sided agreement that makes Trump look good. When we cut off the cheap hydropower and oil shipments to the US, I wonder how much he'll like tweeting in the dark.
2883 2018-08-31 18:08:01 Amount of oil money has little to do with social development. Saudis still behead people on the streets for "crimes" like witchcraft or simply being gay.
But you sure know better because you live there or at least plan to move in the near future, right? Godspeed!
2884 2018-08-31 18:07:53 so you think it's just one broad stroke that painted us into this situation?  wake up!
OFC racism or ethnic fear is a factor to many, but to many many more the sad reality of their economic plight left them blinded and vulnerable to the snake oil salesmen and fear mongers

2888 2018-08-31 18:07:22 Answer: December last year, North Korea may annually import 500,000 tons of oil barrels. According to American information, 89 ships could be supplied with oil in the amount of 1 367 628 barrels, which almost exceeds the permissible limit for 2018.
2889 2018-08-31 18:07:01 I suggest you'd have an insurrection from real BCers in rural BC and oil country in north BC if you tried that one. Sadly, Antifa radicals, drugged out hippies & homeless aren't an export commodity. U'd soon be destitute owned by absentee #Communist #Chinese landlords. #bcpoli
2890 2018-08-31 18:07:00 FRIDAY RECIPE: Here is a natural bug spray recipe. Simply use one-part lemon eucalyptus oil to 10 parts sunflower oil or witch hazel and apply to wherever mosquitos attack. Please note that this mixture should not be used on children under the age of 3.

2894 2018-08-31 18:06:44 Very sad the poor understanding of ‘waste’ and stockfeed in the comments to the article
Eg, rapeseed, 46% is useful oil, the rest (arguably most of it) is pulp & skins, inedible to anything but a ruminant as part of a feedlot diet.
Soys, wheat, cottonseed, brewers grain and so on
2895 2018-08-31 18:06:18 Let's hope the talks are off..let's see what the snake oil salesman has to say.. lol
2896 2018-08-31 18:06:13 I’m down but for oil only 
2897 2018-08-31 18:06:10 Answer: Russia had reservations about the information contained in the report on the Korean regime's breach of this year's limit on oil imports.
2898 2018-08-31 18:05:34 They're alright of you bung them in hot olive oil after you chop them up really small

2899 2018-08-31 18:05:19 You talking about the oil companies again?

2903 2018-08-31 18:04:46 What year are you planning on shutting down the tar sands? You know that oil use is killing the planet so give us an end date. When will you completely diversify away from dirty oil? Tell us when it'll be shut down and we'll reconsider this ill-conceived pipeline to China.

2918 2018-08-31 18:02:51 evo morales has nationalized bolivia's oil, natural gas, electricity, and telecommunications.

2927 2018-08-31 18:01:34 I think you may need to research into the major issues with electric.  Like big dams,  major problems with wind turbines.  Until we find a source that can eliminate oil needs then we have to use it and build new STRONGER safer pipelines before the aging ones give out
2928 2018-08-31 18:01:34 what's your favorite night cream or face oil? i need to buy some during the sale

2944 2018-08-31 17:59:28 Nothing wrong with regulating any company. The oil business is doing just fine anyway and  we have a lot of wind farms in the Permian Basin. Wind farms generate electricity, oil does not but natural gas does and is a nonrenewable fossil fuel
2945 2018-08-31 17:59:23 I get my good oil/fat from nuts/seeds I purée into recipes. I can't breakdown Whole seeds or nuts, all needs to be puréed, & can't tolerate much oil/Fat of any kind... but my Bloodwork is fantastic Best it's ever been & have no health issues since eating this way...

2948 2018-08-31 17:58:52 That wasn't my question.    Obviously oil and coal emit ghg.    I asked if neb took that into account when doing their environmental assessments.
2949 2018-08-31 17:58:51 Vegetable oil also works, swan lighter fluid was the best
2950 2018-08-31 17:58:44 tweet like that is why you have 94 followers.  Astbe Greek say, you are sucking the olive oil out of life.  PCSafety is so #EP17
2951 2018-08-31 17:58:43 Note this is just production emissions. The 2nd figure in the science article color codes heavy vs. light oil, and high flaring vs. low flaring. Not sure sour vs sweet is well correlated with GHGs, but my colleagues could better comment on that.
2952 2018-08-31 17:58:29 BuenAs como ves l oil la semana q viene
2953 2018-08-31 17:58:25 Or like go electric. Combustion engines are terrible polluters.  Our urban spaces will be so much cleaner and quieter when we cut our gasoline addiction.  Let's leave it in the ground for now.  If oil is the future, it'll be worth more later.  If not, we don't need it. #TaxCarbon
2954 2018-08-31 17:58:24 Yes Flint dangerous at set pieces,turns like a fully laden oil tanker tho.
2955 2018-08-31 17:58:23 Waiting for my car’s oil change to go away for the weekend. Just got a call that the guy bringing a new air filter from 20 minutes away got rear ended and is on his way to the hospital.
2956 2018-08-31 17:58:22 Which is worse, a Politician who believes oil is a clean, ethical, environmentally friendly energy source, or a Politician who knows that all of that is 100% bogus, yet still pushes that form of energy?

2960 2018-08-31 17:57:48 Also, ondonsetron (Zofran) really helped his nausea. He could take a lot of it so it had a placebo effect of being able to take something whenever he felt bad-to feel he had some control before the meds even worked.
He used Rick Simpson Oil (a concentrated pot resin) for anxiety.
2961 2018-08-31 17:57:45 Hating or being hated makes people crazy. Hatred is a weird drug, on either end of it. Like a sticky corrosive oil people smear on each other, or like a verbal acid attack. Someday people will see it clearly and stop, ashamed they ever started. But only when they feel safe to.
2962 2018-08-31 17:57:42 Mix jojoba and rose hip oil and use every night. Rose hip oil is anti-aging and helps your skin regenerate faster

2964 2018-08-31 17:57:30 I'ma go to the mall as soon as they hurry up with my oil change
2965 2018-08-31 17:57:19 Commodities seems easy, buy low, sell high! Oil seems like a no brainer for instance. I've never traded them though. Have you tried options?
2966 2018-08-31 17:57:08 And yet you are weak on oil, gas, energy and free trade, all of which define Texas. You know nothing about Texas. Please keep your golf courses and stay away.
2967 2018-08-31 17:57:07 GDP up is bad? Dollar up is good. It lessen import & gives boost to local products. Many countries devalue currency.

2974 2018-08-31 17:55:59 Apply that question to Canada's oil imports.
See what killed Energy East.
Also, ask May if BC's coal industry (exports) are responsible for downstream CO2, and if not why not.
2975 2018-08-31 17:55:48 of course, canada is liberal, they never restrict emissions greatly, the left's plan is always to cripple the US's economy, not their own. that's why left wing countries like canada do little to cut emissions and drill a lot of oil
2976 2018-08-31 17:55:47 It is :) about 1-2 cloves minced garlic to about a handful of minced fish. Season w/ salt and pepper, a tiny pinch of cornflour to help with the binding. A couple of drops of sesame oil is optional.
2977 2018-08-31 17:55:23 Transition to clean energy does not mean global oil demand goes down right away or at all. If tomorrow oil sands production was stopped, that demand would just shift to other parts of the world, to regimes with less environmental protections and labour standards.

2979 2018-08-31 17:55:18 The Canadians (Lorne Michaels, Mike Myers, Moranis, all of them really) have had enough laughs at our expense. They’re mocking us in the streets. 

We must begin regime change.  It is the only way. Plus they have oil.
2980 2018-08-31 17:55:12 I don't understand, it seems there were more stable marriages when parents were choosing partners for their children to marry. 
Well, When you have already finished the oil before you even cook what do you expect. 
  
2981 2018-08-31 17:55:11 There is a problem. there are no companies that are run by muslims, who can produce this high quality products made in the Netherlands. the only export products from muslim country’s are; hate, oil and low IQ refugees!
2982 2018-08-31 17:55:10 Coconut is termed as kalpavruksha for no small reason, every part of the tree is useful. Coconut oil on my skin is a natural moisturiser, on my head is a natural cooling agent, on cracks and wounds is a natural healer and on my plate is yummy for my tummy.
2983 2018-08-31 17:55:02 Also, you might wanna revamp your tired “welfare queen” trope when we know more money goes to subsidizing oil and petroleum companies. You do understand how corporate welfare works and how there is more money spent on it than on things like SNAP and daycare benefits.
2984 2018-08-31 17:54:55 Middle East runs out of oil ?? U know that would throw Millions of people into poverty right
2985 2018-08-31 17:54:36 I can't believe olive oil has so many calories I could drink an entire glass of it

2987 2018-08-31 17:54:29 Shale gas does not significantly lower emissions, even compared to coal. Evidence of real-world sampling demonstrates that.

Only assumed 'accountancy' analysis of oil/chemical industry shows lower impact; but that's not 'measured', it's inferred.

2988 2018-08-31 17:54:28 Demo is the key reason; even favourable international crude oil rates couldn’t compensate it!!
2989 2018-08-31 17:54:27 I would also need CBD oil to deal with the pain of being a Browns fan.
2990 2018-08-31 17:54:20 “...our oil is the best in the world”? Do you realize how dumb that sounds? It literally sounds like a thing Trump would say.
2991 2018-08-31 17:54:10 Snake oil!
Ping: @LarsJOmegapoint
2992 2018-08-31 17:54:09 He’s repeatedly appeared as a paid guest on PressTV, the official state media channel of the Iranian Government. Our relationship with Saudi is repugnant, but from a realpolitik pov necessary. Until we can ween ourselves off their oil. Then we can tell them to fuck off.
2993 2018-08-31 17:54:04 He put Scotland on the map! Didn't take mps salarly, gave it to charity! Have us Scottish folk a good for future, after wastemonster wasting Scotland oil! Gave us the truth after liebou r keeping us poor for 70 years! List is endless! And I'm only 4 years in!
2994 2018-08-31 17:53:48 Agli bar b modi sarkar... FYI oil prices are in control on international market ,not in hand of modi ...jai modi

Anyone ever set their frying pan on fire by putting frozen sausages in hot oil ?

Na, me neither

2997 2018-08-31 17:52:54 Tapikan kalau nak cure oily skin tu org guna oil jugak. And minyak gamat ni macam almost semua sakit boleh guna semua baik lepastu 
2998 2018-08-31 17:52:53 @MaximeBernier @AndrewScheer @PierrePoilievre @ezralevant @fordnation @SheilaGunnReid @SaugaMayor @TheRebelTV So, the liberals have converted taxpayers to oil pipeline investors. I can’t wait for the first shareholders meeting to get Morneau’s projected ROI.
2999 2018-08-31 17:52:44 There's one at the end of church St that will also sell you cbd oil (in or out of the latte).
3000 2018-08-31 17:52:44 why are we behaving like we don't have oil
3001 2018-08-31 17:52:43 No you didn’t say no oil! 
3002 2018-08-31 17:52:41 Trying to make some bacon wrapped hotdogs, but this hot oil keep popping like a mf!
3003 2018-08-31 17:52:40 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.
3004 2018-08-31 17:52:39 It’s been almost SEVEN hours since I dropped my car off for an OIL change and INSPECTION... and still no word on it.
3005 2018-08-31 17:52:38 Looks like it's time too change the oil, injoy
3006 2018-08-31 17:52:31 ho dear, so many diversity! At least 80 different because you have the regional specialty individual by the type of flour, wet ingredient, sup ingredient, shape… one of my favourite from my own region is the fougasse, a bread with olive oil and typically with ham or olive!
3007 2018-08-31 17:52:19 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
3008 2018-08-31 17:52:09 We need to leave Confederation - we have a PM that hates Oil & hates the West more. 4 more years of him & u will not recognize our Country.  So let’s get a movement going.  Brad Wall we need u.
3009 2018-08-31 17:52:01 .@TheJuanWilliams was fired by NPR for simply speaking the truth about the very common human reaction to flying with Muslims, out of fear they might be terrorists. That's all. He simply voiced his concern, his fear, -- a reaction that many people today have, & WITH GOOD REASON!
3010 2018-08-31 17:52:00 Where is the oil. I’m not going to act like this sounds great. That squeal. Wow. Ok.
3011 2018-08-31 17:51:52 Nobama in my white house (keep in mind, my house is painted white)! Public school is a brainwashing tool for the terminally uncool! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
3012 2018-08-31 17:51:33 5/
- Companies wildly tied to macro trends on way up and down ($CRR, oil drilling). Pile on the long/shorts when those margins start changing!
- Controversial stock enters new market ($AMZN + @awscloud)
3013 2018-08-31 17:51:31 Tired as fuck. Got paid and got smokes, oil and time for work again 
3014 2018-08-31 17:51:29 Are you going to sell Ted on your awesome idea to turn oil into coal? Don't forget to bring up your coal powered cars epiphany...
3015 2018-08-31 17:51:27 Mark Walhberg had a rough life man....survived a war in Afghanistan...move to Louisiana to work at an oil rig shit blew up..then said fuck it be a cop in Boston...damn race terrorist attack
3016 2018-08-31 17:51:17 Rinsola called Patience Goodluck a hippo? 
She does realise she's no oil painting herself? 
I won't be throwing stones if I were her with a piggy nose like that?
3017 2018-08-31 17:51:16 or revive the refinery at coast and consume our own oil
3018 2018-08-31 17:51:13 o batla brooklux or castor oil?

3020 2018-08-31 17:50:58 Evidence? The US has discovered massive energy resources in Alaska and elsewhere, they have enough energy to supply the whole world for hundreds of years. Israel have also discovered huge energy resources and there is Russian gas. Meanwhile the oil refineries in SA running dry.
3021 2018-08-31 17:50:55 None come to the tryst! Oil has a very specific set of antlers better than a mint.
3022 2018-08-31 17:50:52 @POTUS what's the deal with the super high price of gas and diesel.  Thought we produced more that anyone. Msybe we need to increase the price of oil leases
3023 2018-08-31 17:50:49 How long will the oil wait before they pull the trigger on a big move for an established top-4 d-man? (Maybe at the cost of 1st rounder?)
3024 2018-08-31 17:50:41 Drove past a Tesla with the license plate "OIL LOL" today. THAT is big dick energy.
3025 2018-08-31 17:50:26 Do you know where things stand with the Alberta based upgrader project that the NDP ran on in 2015? If Alberta were to produce added value products from its various oil deposits, it would have enough revenue to help advance all the sciences. It does need to link w/Democracy@Work
3026 2018-08-31 17:50:12 why don't we refine the turkana oil in South Sudan and bring it back to kenya so that we stop all this bureaucracrap
3027 2018-08-31 17:50:04 No palm oil  no sugar  wow! Really would love to try these healthy peanut butter 
3028 2018-08-31 17:49:59 Since Achnacarry Agreement = Seven Sisters [Esso (Standard Oil of New Jersey, now Exxon), Mobil (Standard Oil of NY), Gulf Oil, Texaco, Standard Oil of California (Chevron), Royal Dutch Shell, and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (British Petroleum)] are effectively one institution!
3029 2018-08-31 17:49:56 I love the smell of toasted sesame oil.
3030 2018-08-31 17:49:45 I read that CBD oil doesn't make someone "high". It Just makes their symptoms easier to handle.
3031 2018-08-31 17:49:43 That's because Congress and the House are filled with used car and snake oil salesman and women. Pass a law demanding full financial disclosure for people who serve for ten years after they leave office. Then build more jails. You'll need them. Check there immediate family too.
3032 2018-08-31 17:49:41 marvin sapp got that good oil
3033 2018-08-31 17:49:35 Democratic Socialist to you... :P I like my free health care, $15 minimum wage, and tax returns from oil sands... whats your party done for you? Built that wall? lol
3034 2018-08-31 17:49:28 we are so debted up again, i honestly wouldn't be surprised if we get to summer'19 and high price oil brings on a small recession.
3035 2018-08-31 17:49:26 Good to remember, since we are speaking of a marine environment here, that does not respect national boundaries that the often-used 7-fold figure applies to oil tankers only AND takes no account at all of Wash/US tankers. It is essentially gibberish.
3036 2018-08-31 17:49:22 Thats not snake oil thats just delusional. Stop wasting your time this is my last response

3040 2018-08-31 17:48:52 Yesterday Timothy went to Walmart and came back home and said I got all the stuff for our oil changes & I got the baby something too. He takes such good care of me and Malloree!
3041 2018-08-31 17:48:45 They are still giving out the Obama phones in California!
3042 2018-08-31 17:48:44 When you splash boiling oil on your hand it sticks and doesn’t stop boiling.. who knew...?  that sucked
3043 2018-08-31 17:48:41 No this has to do with 3 spoiler candidates and make you forget there is a peoples candidate. Snake oil from the prone company, too much sugar and it barely masks the rancid saltiness.
3044 2018-08-31 17:48:37 @ArethaFranklin Is there going to be an alter call with anointing oil at Aretha's funeral? Most Traitors and Killers,Gun Runners and Crooks are there, Clintons, Sharpton, Jackson, and MAD MAXINE! Inquiring minds wants to know. Is this going to be a Salvation Station?
3045 2018-08-31 17:48:36 Did you just refer to the oil sands as an engineering marvel!?.. I was thinking more along the lines as the biggest black eye Canada has ever had.
3046 2018-08-31 17:48:35 Also use advance oil efficient heat transfer thermic fluid heaters to reduce thermic fluid top up expenses. Check combustion efficiency of furnaces as per BS 845 method periodically and get tuned
3047 2018-08-31 17:48:20 It’s said that black seed oil cures everything but death.
3048 2018-08-31 17:48:16 US June oil demand of 20.705mbpd compares with

3050 2018-08-31 17:48:09 Use it to buy explosives and liberate some oil
3051 2018-08-31 17:47:48 A new study claims that olive oil may be better than Viagra. Sounds like a weird salad to me. 
3052 2018-08-31 17:47:37 Had goosebumps watching @iam_Davido Aza video. Niger Deltans are really suffering from the oil spillage in the region...
3053 2018-08-31 17:47:31 I am with you if it has oil
3054 2018-08-31 17:47:06 thanks yesterday’s headlines no extra oil tankers in #bc  #StopKM #kindermorgan our orcas need clean water too @cathmckenna #bcpoli #cndpoli
3055 2018-08-31 17:47:03 WTI oil at $70.11/barrel, -$0.14.
3056 2018-08-31 17:46:58 I just cried at that commercial where they wash that baby duckling with dawn dish soap after he was soaked in oil and that’s how I know my periods coming.
3057 2018-08-31 17:46:56 I want someone really smart, political and an excellent writer to put in tehrir form what happened to pakistan this July. Just say it.
3058 2018-08-31 17:46:37 beef in black bean sauce for me.he made it with  chilli oil.used to make his eyes water and he come out the back with a cob on and give mary down the banks.haha
3059 2018-08-31 17:46:30 Rather than destroy the machine when they took #arleg Republicans just took over the controls and changed the oil. I don't know which party is going to get lucky and be given an undeserved second chance this time. But whichever it is should consider taking a hammer to it. #arpx
3060 2018-08-31 17:46:30 Yeah was going to say CBD oil has just about no THC in it, which is the sole purpose of it. :)
3061 2018-08-31 17:46:29 You can’t be serious. Why would a country purposely put so many out of jobs, forcing a need to retrain and find work elsewhere, when the demand for oil and related products continues to grow by leaps and bounds. Canada has the most ethical oil production in the world. Silly
3062 2018-08-31 17:46:20 For healthy shiny hair use a hot oil treatment once a week.
3063 2018-08-31 17:46:16 I'd probably try tea tree oil. Most dogs can't stand perfume (right they are ;p) and there's some spray to repulse dogs, but don't know how well it works. Creepy noise like rustling of paper from a garland of newspaper would be another idea.
3064 2018-08-31 17:46:16 I would have tackled her the minute she put that jack down

3068 2018-08-31 17:46:05 We'd have it already if Chia wasn't too busy working on the Oil Kings 
3069 2018-08-31 17:46:02 East needs the work just like BC needs oil...unless all the vehicles and ships and planes there are battery driven.
3070 2018-08-31 17:45:39 Toyota’s the only place I know that takes 2+ hours to do an oil change

3072 2018-08-31 17:45:23 In 2017, PEMEX states the thefts of gas and oil are a threat to the national security of the country.
3073 2018-08-31 17:45:20 It won’t have flow rates but should say Oil, biggie is Djeno tbh ... that can see the £ hit
3074 2018-08-31 17:45:19 What Trump really means: "I just cannot state strongly enough how totally dishonest I am." "I am the biggest snake oil salesman in the business that will screw everyone in the end"
3075 2018-08-31 17:45:14 If you havent noticed uganda recently discovered they have oil..so thats why they want a puppet they can control who is not woke who is not visionary enough beyond his froglike nose like museveni...they have their interest at heart.
3076 2018-08-31 17:45:05 Ooouuu I can’t wait to take this down and get a hot oil treatment 
3077 2018-08-31 17:45:02 Friend mudhi with a bit of oil and haldi,pyaz is next level.I Add some mixture and chai to it too.
3078 2018-08-31 17:44:59 What the fuck is he even talking about?! Zoom out there Fox News, how many people are buying this shill’s snake oil?
3079 2018-08-31 17:44:55 These are “paid for climate advertisements” financed by the Trump administration to remove Canadian bargaining power from the Canadians at the NAFTA negotiating table,so the can control & set lowest pricing for theeconomy.This allows theto burn more oil.”Check Mate”.
3080 2018-08-31 17:44:54 I’ve heard cannabis oil works wonders..either way it’s worth a try. x

3083 2018-08-31 17:44:36 . The oil we pop the corn in is a combination of a corn and coconut oil, and our buttery topping (which is optional) is also vegan as it is a soy bean oil.
3084 2018-08-31 17:44:26 Enjoy your short term victory folks as u r truly a minority as u r not the majority & your version of the truth is flawed U r only helping the US get cheap oil & remember this pipeline has already existed for 50 years ! @bcliberals
3085 2018-08-31 17:44:13 Someone take my car to get an oil change  a bitch really don’t be having time for shit
3086 2018-08-31 17:44:13 Our Auto Tech and Auto Collision Repair students and some of our teaching staff visited Lucas Oil Raceway today for the NHRA US Nationals.  They toured the pit areas and even met up with some drivers including three-time Top Fuel champion Antron Brown.
3087 2018-08-31 17:44:10 Not hard enough...  CBD oil is low cost and natural.  But, you aren't interested because it isn't something you can patent.  I think you are working hard to add to your bottom line.  Putting profit before compassion is no longer going to work.  It has already started to crumble.
3088 2018-08-31 17:44:07 Thanks! The chilli oil is awesome!

3090 2018-08-31 17:43:47 BTW where was RePotLick when it was #5Poiint6. Busy pedaling the Hindu-Muslim trash, I suppose. Have you ever talked about rising oil prices, weakening of constitutional institutions, judiciary, farmer suicides, failure of demonitisation, faulty GST ,etc.
3091 2018-08-31 17:43:46 In my experience when women say “Neiman Marcus” they’re expecting you to interpret that as “rotary sander”. Granted all my relationships seem to end just after their birthday or Christmas but I’m sure that’s just a coincidence.
3092 2018-08-31 17:43:43 Still burning the oil . Clients are responsible neither me nor govt ,
3093 2018-08-31 17:43:39 What about "Big Oil"? Evidently there are demented conspiracy theorists who believe that four or five super-major firms dominate the global petroleum industry.

3098 2018-08-31 17:43:23 Slow on the draw.
3099 2018-08-31 17:43:22 US Renewable Energy Sources Surpass Nuclear....

If you like make China your other room. Americans don't care about your oil and gas.
3100 2018-08-31 17:43:06 It’s also troubling how many people jumped on the cleanest oil in the world bandwagon.
3101 2018-08-31 17:42:46 Help wanted at ABR. Looking for licensed oil technicians, if interested please private message us.

Have a great weekend!
3102 2018-08-31 17:42:41 Trump should go after the real oligarchs: Facebook; Twitter; Alphabet. Scoop Jackson went after the oil companies, Trump would be more popular after breaking them up.
3103 2018-08-31 17:42:41 Like you, I used to be passionate & judge others, until I learned to see things from ALL perspective. Vegans support planet destruction, animal extinction too. Look at palm oil industry, quinoa industry, etc. Btw, I don't eat dairy. Don't get stuck on labels.
3104 2018-08-31 17:42:37 Is it too much to ask for us to take a moment out of this service to lay hands on Gladys Knight? She has the same cancer that took Aretha away from us. If any of those pastors sitting on stage got any oil, they can cast that out right now, no? #ArethaHomegoing
3105 2018-08-31 17:42:34 My stepdad made my day got my oil changed for me and filled my car up with gas

3107 2018-08-31 17:42:25 Now is the time for Canada to turn off our hydro, water, oil & timber that we sell to the USA!  Or even better, apply a 50% tariff on all of it. Trudeau don’t sign any deal with this idiot!
3108 2018-08-31 17:42:21 My favourite no-carb is salad with sun dried tomatoes, halloumi and any fruit I fancy tossed in walnut oil.
3109 2018-08-31 17:42:18 The only thing I can think to suggest is one of my friends tells me weed is really good at relieving migraines, but I'm not sure if it's legal in your area beyond CBD oil.
3110 2018-08-31 17:42:16 Yeah fair enough, I assume he doesn't actually think oil is the cleanest, that would just be comical.  I say we may as well get all the oil possible out of the ground now while it's still worth something, cause eventually it'll be left behind.
3111 2018-08-31 17:42:07 I need somebody from woke twitter to fill me on black seed oil
3112 2018-08-31 17:41:57 Think I’ll sack Twitter off for tonight, it’s very depressing. Give your heads a wobble Nobbers and Noberettes it’s Friday neet, go out and get lashed to oil your vocal chords before we play Horwich. Nice One. #pnefc
3113 2018-08-31 17:41:56 Aeeiishh, devil, you are a liar..Right when I was getting to the pinnacle of @yvonneorji and @luvvie #jesusandjellof,soundcloud has stopped working.. I will  go find one of the many bottles of olive oil, sprinkle it on my computer, and have high expectations for a miracle.
3114 2018-08-31 17:41:51 The economy will be a mess again because we're putting all our eggs in the oil basket.

3117 2018-08-31 17:41:26 One word, Jason.
Oil.
3118 2018-08-31 17:41:19 Premise of the video was for me to oil my body. Got too turned on to do the oil part.
3119 2018-08-31 17:41:02 Aye, paid for with Scotland's oil money
3120 2018-08-31 17:41:01 yes of course, that's what I told. We can't blame coconut oil for every thing including our bad life style. Nowadays most of us are adopting north indian culture, using sunflower oil and eating chapatis at dinner. Yet health issues have seen only an increase in the recent times
3121 2018-08-31 17:40:51 I find the lavender and orange oil Dettol good for fabrics 
3122 2018-08-31 17:40:33 I’ll tell you what from my experience there’s only drunks and druggies in the oil field

3124 2018-08-31 17:40:29 Global oil demand growth of almost 2% last year. Similar forecast this year. Efficiency gains in the ICE will displace more oil demand in next 10 yrs than electric cars. Consumers demanding light truck/SUVs vs sedans. Hardly the decline of big oil w/o change in consumer behavior.
3125 2018-08-31 17:40:25 いいよーしよか！
3126 2018-08-31 17:40:20 Fundamentals are still ok. Hence RBI does not feel the need to intervene . As Nita mentioned , USD has appreciated due to increased oil prices and this has impacted most emerging market currencies.
3127 2018-08-31 17:40:19 I really should of went & got a oil change today 
3128 2018-08-31 17:40:14 Canada doesn't but oil. Unethical greedy oil companies do. Go protest Irving refineries.
3129 2018-08-31 17:40:13 これ？ドレッシングっていうか廃油。
3130 2018-08-31 17:40:00 Yes, oil has owners and are their citizents, would you like exxon to own those wells?
3131 2018-08-31 17:39:58 & oil changes
3132 2018-08-31 17:39:55 Dab of bio oil
3133 2018-08-31 17:39:49 Nobody stays at the top forever:
GE stock broke down below $26 in July 2017 - collapsed to $13 - got kicked out of Dow Jones index.
Exxon Mobil now despite strong oil prices has been in hibernation - nobody seems interested in the stock
3134 2018-08-31 17:39:49 Homemade lilac essential oil experiment is a success! Got it all over me while decanting but that just means I smell good 8)
3135 2018-08-31 17:39:49 U forgot the elephant in the room. Hint, Weight Watchers...
3136 2018-08-31 17:39:23 they prolly look like a French fry suspended in vegetable oil
3137 2018-08-31 17:39:10 Oil is not the “life of the dollar.” It is the life of those who profit off of the fossil fuel industry. So if we start fighting climate change once & for all, you seriously think that it would guarantee that the US economy goes into a deep recession/depression?
3138 2018-08-31 17:38:56 #16 VAT...what a paradox is it to see fuel skyrocket every sec when we've started to extract our own crude oil... Uhuru.robbing Kenyans on broad daylight
3139 2018-08-31 17:38:50 Peppermint oil on a freshly washed scalp just blesses the soul.
3140 2018-08-31 17:38:49 it’s hash oil
3141 2018-08-31 17:38:40 Coconut oil pri, whatever u need I got
3142 2018-08-31 17:38:25 Depends how big it is! It’s a quick process but it feels like boiling oil splashing on your skin for a couple of seconds
3143 2018-08-31 17:38:15 Peppermint oil behind your ears and on your temples & a cold washcloth on your neck  feel better sweetpea
3144 2018-08-31 17:38:13 Keep Bugs Away With This Essential Oil Mason Jar Repellent

3146 2018-08-31 17:38:07 I am OBSSESED with vitamin e oil. My hair was so dry and wouldn’t grow an inch and ever since I started applying some on my tips along with Garnier Fructis Sleek & Shine it is soooo healthy and ugh I love my hair lol
3147 2018-08-31 17:38:06 Um, they don’t sell Kimbers at Neiman Marcus....?  Be good to your lady!
3148 2018-08-31 17:38:05 This is a common line of attack from the Oil industry now: claiming that renewables are "bad for the environment" because, like, 4 birds died by smacking into Wind turbines
3149 2018-08-31 17:38:05 No one seems to have a problem with importing oil from Venezuela, Saudi or any of those places into Canada where we know their standards are nothing compared to Canada’s. Buy local!
3150 2018-08-31 17:38:00 Guess what BC ships out of their port. Coal!! That's right, it's ok to ship coal by sea but AB oil is not ok.
3151 2018-08-31 17:37:55 I've seen some of those orcas hanging out at Delta Port - next to the big BC Ferries terminal. Their fate is tied to Chinook salmon that are being depleted by over-fishing. @jjhorgan would need take on the commercial fishers & FNs. Oil tankers are a softer target out here.
3152 2018-08-31 17:37:51 I hate getting oil changes 
3153 2018-08-31 17:37:48 China looking to lock in more supply of oil in CNY or am I reading too much into it? @LukeGromen
3154 2018-08-31 17:37:44 Ganduje should learn from him. We're tired of the "no money excuse". Let's face it.. We're way out of recession, Oil price is up, Kano is generating more money than ever. WE NEED AGGRESSIVE CITY DEVELOPMENTS. Kano is going backwards under him. Daba rising because of him too.
3155 2018-08-31 17:37:37 I've legit been to like 7 different neurologists who have tried everything on the books and nothing works. CBD oil helps a little, but not enough. And any new doctor I see just kind of determines something else is my problem and bounces me to another specialist
3156 2018-08-31 17:37:24 Erdogan of Turkey is one of most Hungry for territory, expansion into areas of OIL! In order to get revenue! It's not easy funding a desired takeover of much of the Oil Producing Middle East with his NATO Funded Military! @HouseCracka @BBCWorld
3157 2018-08-31 17:37:20 It was defo better before oil money got involved
3158 2018-08-31 17:37:10 Oil biz for sure which is great. I hope investment in oil patch dries up 100%
3159 2018-08-31 17:37:09 Why is this man in the Jiffy Lube waiting room talking to me? Let me have a panic attack about my overdue oil change in peace. 
3160 2018-08-31 17:37:09 Somebody left a full oil pen and I don’t smoke sooo it’s up for grabs
3161 2018-08-31 17:36:54 The wealth of Nigeria is not its diamonds, gold, oil etc etc, but it’s people particularly the youth and that is Dr @bukolasaraki vision all about.

3163 2018-08-31 17:36:41 Free oil for Pakistan???
3164 2018-08-31 17:36:38 Even a snake oil salesman has a few products that 'work.' 

If he didn't, he'd be out of business in short order, or required to stay on the 'move' indefinitely...
3165 2018-08-31 17:36:31 Thank you, Pat

#FF @phemsworth for thoughtful comments on oil trading and other matters.    Make sure you listen to her interviews.  Search twitter for these interviews
3166 2018-08-31 17:36:27 I belong to a forum where most everyone is keto and they eat frozen coconut oil. (fat bombs) it will have a dab of pb or cocoa in it but it is still a handful of oil. so gross.
3167 2018-08-31 17:36:24 Jojoba oil, coconut oil, argan oil, tea tree oil, olive oil
3168 2018-08-31 17:36:24 Still, coconut oil is the very best makeup remover... just don’t eat it... no prob bc it tastes 
3169 2018-08-31 17:36:18 peppermint oil is a blessing
3170 2018-08-31 17:36:06 Juan was very blessed as some years ago, he was fired from NPR and Fox picked him up. G-d only knows why!
3171 2018-08-31 17:36:05 The choir is just dope
3172 2018-08-31 17:36:02 It’s a win for foreign oil
3173 2018-08-31 17:35:54 Awwwwwwww dat’s norty Pandy, we put up and shut up, when Mum advances towards us wiv da flannel! Currently she uses apple and tea tree shampoo for dogs, with a tiny drop of baby oil in da water
3174 2018-08-31 17:35:52 IDK what else to do for this @craftsman yard tractor. I've replaced the fuel, oil, & air filters. The spark plug & fuel solenoid are new as of today as well. I had a tech come out & he got it to run for all of a day (by loading it with carb-cleaner)  before it stopped again.
3175 2018-08-31 17:35:29 What's a cleaner more environmentally friendly way to transport the oil though?  They're going to transport it no matter what...
3176 2018-08-31 17:35:27 Welcome to Alberta, where even our "leftists" love oil over health.
3177 2018-08-31 17:35:25 It's been a good 72 hours for racetracks. First we hear about SMI and Nashville Fairgrounds discussions, then Rockingham is sold to investors, and then we learn about Lucas Oil Raceway announcing upgrades to tbe oval. Hopefully bright futures ahead.
3178 2018-08-31 17:35:25 You are assuming everything stays on course. You can’t change something without first slowing it down. It’s like changing oil on a car while the car is moving
3179 2018-08-31 17:35:17 Right on, I'm always up for a little Oil talk!
3180 2018-08-31 17:34:57 "My speciality is oil on canvas. Almost looking like a photo or weird shit that makes people questioning my sanity."
3181 2018-08-31 17:34:43 This while Japan looks for exemption to buy oil from Iran....What's wrong with this picture...Getting most of your oil from Alaska pipeline & other US sources not enough
3182 2018-08-31 17:34:42 Coconut oil 
3183 2018-08-31 17:34:39 How is it 16% vat with the country's ability to drill for oil?  This commodity is supposed to get cheaper. How much is the government's contribution(%) in the importation of crude oil so as to protect the faithful taxpayer?
3184 2018-08-31 17:34:32 That Permian Basin is really booming right. And along with several new gas processing plants (think Sasol Mega Project) and the brand new very large oil refinery from Raven Petroleum it's no wonder. Poor North Dakota is feeling like the ugly stepsister.
3185 2018-08-31 17:34:31 Black Seed Oil taste disgusting but it’s WORTH it!
3186 2018-08-31 17:34:17 Thanks for being such a hard ass while dealing with Canada in trade talks. We’ll be buying our frui and vegetables from S.A., finished goods fro the EU, build an EAST-West pipeline to sell our oil to Asia and the EU. All good for Canada. Doing what we should have done years ago.
3187 2018-08-31 17:34:16 it was the price if they made even the littlest of mistakes the video was one of the first oil changes of a new bugatti veyron. They took down some of the carbon fiber down it was amazing.

3190 2018-08-31 17:34:11 #LPC shld order PMJT to work on #oil rigs for 3 months. He'll learn skills, appreciate workers, value jobs,  respect risk; grow up. #cndpoli
3191 2018-08-31 17:33:55 And why does most of the world keep USD treasuries & dollar reserves? Why are most commodities priced in USD especially oil, in the first place?
3192 2018-08-31 17:33:46 Hey guys whats the BEST oil or grease for dry scalp i can buy over the counter ????
3193 2018-08-31 17:33:34 How about oil me up with pov special. Would be good 
3194 2018-08-31 17:33:30 1. US oil buyers. They get a 20 to 30 dollar discount
2. Rail companies
3. Every other oil producer in the world.
4. Green NGOS paid by American foundations
3195 2018-08-31 17:33:17 ugh i smell like tea tree oil tho bc some dingus put it on their dog.... it's v toxic to animals so we had to wash it off but it's soooo strong smelling i might have to change my shirt (~_~;)
3196 2018-08-31 17:33:16 For youthful skin, mix 8 drops black seed oil, 8 drops chia seed oil & 1 tbsp sweet almond oil. Apply overnight. #budgetbeauty #beautytips
3197 2018-08-31 17:33:10 I will continue to call McCain a traitor and war criminal who sacrificed American lives for oil.
3198 2018-08-31 17:32:59 You work way too hard at trying to clean up an oil spill with a Q-tip.
3199 2018-08-31 17:32:41 That's true, but one musn't underestimate the influence of the CIA deposing the secular, democratic government of Iran in favor of a puppet government to ensure that their oil reserves remained in the hands of BP rather than controlled by Iranians, which ultimately led to what
3200 2018-08-31 17:32:35 Dick and boobs  isn't that oil and water?
3201 2018-08-31 17:32:32 Alberta needs money to make sure children are educated, hospitals are built etc. until our economy is diversified to the level of providing for Alberta we have to make our oil as safe as possible. Our economy was in a mess the ND have my support.
3202 2018-08-31 17:32:28 Then why is the Tesla service plan $600/year?  That's as much as oil changes regularly?
3203 2018-08-31 17:32:14 Total U.S. rigs rise by 4, oil rigs up 2 in Baker Hughes survey
3204 2018-08-31 17:32:13 Put some peppermint essential oil on and around your stuff! It’ll repel them leggy bois without hurting them :)
3205 2018-08-31 17:32:04 Trump is trying to get Canada to quit charging over a 250% tariff on our milk.  Why not blame Canada?  Stop taking oil from them.
3206 2018-08-31 17:32:03 not generally, no. the protestors are against the injustice of it and so have a moral advantage over the profit seeking oil industry and deeply corrupted governments.

plus a false equivalence. the gov't and oil industry have ALL the power... except when the courts slap 'em down!

3212 2018-08-31 17:31:11 Yeah ik  swear like I’m one of the few who never take the piss out of city’s “oil money” and “plastic fans” when realistically, united and arsenal have a lot more 
3213 2018-08-31 17:31:03 I come home to visit for 1 week and my dad is force feeding me CBD oil because he thinks it will cure my depression lol. #2018
3214 2018-08-31 17:30:56 Amazing what oil money will do.
3215 2018-08-31 17:30:47 start rolling a blunt then heat the oil wit a lighter let it drip on there u gon be loaded
3216 2018-08-31 17:30:41 my training got cancelled for today so i decided to be an adult an actually get my oil changed 
3217 2018-08-31 17:30:35 It's urgent for you to have an MRI. You're either  extremely ignorant or you have a serious, possibly fatal, brain disorder. Anyone who thinks petroleum is "the most environmentally friendly energy" is obviously very ill. (Oh, btw, I have no problem with oil, for now). #cdnpoli
3218 2018-08-31 17:30:35 Govt policy killed all pipelines, drove business investment out with carbon tax and raising business taxes. It's simple, policy matters. 
US oil industry and economy BOOMING with the same commodity prices. 
Saskatchewan doing much better than AB with the same prices.
3219 2018-08-31 17:30:32 PLEASE, WILL SOMEONE STOP AND THINK ABOUT THE OIL CEOS 
3220 2018-08-31 17:30:29 Under the leadership of @narendramodi india clocks the fastest oil price growth of 82 per litter in the last 10 weeks. It is the manifestation of our sound economic policies and Cements our position as the fastest growing economy in the world by @ChouhanShivraj
3221 2018-08-31 17:30:24 What are you talking about? The Chinese laughed at Trudeau and sent him packing, no pipeline to export oil beyond the US market, Canada's auto sector employs 500,000 people, and on and on...
3222 2018-08-31 17:30:23 OK, c’mon, seriously, WHO is benefiting from blocking Canadian oil access to world markets? 
3223 2018-08-31 17:30:11 I can't decide I like both  
And it looked like an oil painting polished with fixative. The color combination is good and the highlights....  Really good. You render so smoothly. And you can draw hands  I REALLY REALLY LOVE THIS 
3224 2018-08-31 17:30:06 I use oil on my face now thanks to Stella but make up is still a huge mystery to me. I wonder if men would make more of an effort if we told them more that we appreciated it when they did? My husband gets his beard trimmed professionally now purely because I love it when he does
3225 2018-08-31 17:30:05 health youtuber: air fryer that fries food without oil !!

Do you... do you mean an Oven
3226 2018-08-31 17:29:46 Farhan Virk is checking refund policy for the oil he bought for his keyboard.
3227 2018-08-31 17:29:43 Yes Trump,Pompeo and Bolton are currently trying to institute regime change in Iran as they are in Syria. Like their action in South America countries it is all for OIL. Like McCain they will have a legacy and be remembered in history as Warmongers and killers of the innocents
3228 2018-08-31 17:29:42 Niche groups? 

Like tax cuts for the .01% 
Bailots for soybean farmers hurt by Trump’s vanity trade war? 
Rollback of car emission standards for big oil?

Those niche groups?
3229 2018-08-31 17:29:37 I don’t think anyone realizes how stoked I am that I get a day off tomorrow. And Monday! I thought I wasn’t gonna get one until the 14th. Other than getting my oil changed, I’m excited to do nothing.
3230 2018-08-31 17:29:30 Our bedroom smells of Katinko, Efficascent Oil and Salonpas. My husband is horrified.  #TanderCat But to be honest, I love it. It’s so relaxing. 
3231 2018-08-31 17:29:27 What am I missing here.. we get about 60% of oil from the USA and another 30% from Saudi. We then spent 15 billions$ of taxpayers money to build a pipeline so we can sell the oil to the Chinese (by that time getting paid in Petro Yuans)??
3232 2018-08-31 17:29:21 Another great follow - @govttrader
3233 2018-08-31 17:28:57 Oh no! We will get through it! Wel will have to burn the midnight oil... in our onesies!

3236 2018-08-31 17:28:24 Their argument is that they can only get fair trade value if they can trade oil with other customers. Right now most of the oil goes straight to the US.
3237 2018-08-31 17:28:20 i just came to get my oil changed, dassit!!
3238 2018-08-31 17:28:12 Ah yes. I’ll totally trust the oil and gas industry to tell me that there is no alternative to their product. Count me convinced.

-Anxiety attacks happen less often!
-I'm sleeping better, more soundly through the night

3243 2018-08-31 17:27:40 You have screwed up the oil and gas industry, trade, and immigration. This government should be examples in a class on mistakes a federal government makes domestically and internationally.
3244 2018-08-31 17:27:34 Venezuela is not the largest proven oil deposit - as I said on the original tweet the largest proven deposit is in Saudi Arabia the Ghawar field discovered in 1948. The proven field in Venezuela only held 3 billion barrels some some 7 times smaller.
3245 2018-08-31 17:27:14 I shave once a year to avoid this. Before i use to use beard oil.
3246 2018-08-31 17:27:09 The Trans Mountain failure was a win for the Trudeau and gang, anti Alberta oil agenda. Make no mistake Canadians, we got duped, big time!
3247 2018-08-31 17:26:57 Pgn yg oil
3248 2018-08-31 17:26:57 The proof was a lady who said she saw a marked diff in her husband who started remembering things after taking coconut oil regularly....
3249 2018-08-31 17:26:48 Don’t go down the rabbit hole
3250 2018-08-31 17:26:44 I hate car dealerships. I’m here for an oil change, no I don’t want to get into another lease.
3251 2018-08-31 17:26:43 I’m just going to say it; cheese is lit.  Especially cheese battered, fried in peanut oil, and impaled on a stick.
3252 2018-08-31 17:26:38 So you'd be cool with David duke showing up at McCain's funeral? Farrakhan is a snake oil salesman whos made a lucrative career preying on the minds (and wallets) of other hateful people. If that's what Aretha was also about, as you suggest, then she can be forgotten too.
3253 2018-08-31 17:26:36 Debates r going on. Actually no oil is purely good for health, unless we use them in controlled way. So we can try different kinds of oils in our cooking. Every oil has both good & bad effects. I dont think malayalis suffer more in terms of diseases if compared with North Indians
3254 2018-08-31 17:26:28 Check out Aaron Zulpo's new work Visions West Contemporary.  The series, The Fiery Red Head Strikes Again, are filled with excitement, danger and tension!  We LOVE fiery red head's. Each painting is oil on panel

(also, I want this post to be the one that makes "fatmansplaining" a thing)

3261 2018-08-31 17:25:17 Health update for anyone that cares! I’ve been flare-free for basically 3 weeks now and all it took was to stop taking 7 prescription drugs and start taking CBD oil. I feel amazing for the first time in months, I’ve gained 4lbs, no more vomiting. Color me amazed and so grateful
3262 2018-08-31 17:25:15 10 yrs and goodbye to the oil and save the planet; vested interests just want to make you pay taxes to use their product... all we got to do is make it happen. Let's see the political engagement and effort for that policy..

3265 2018-08-31 17:25:12 - Remains under investigation...? Hmm. I think the circumstances of the situation with the woman soon to be wearing orange is pretty clear.
3266 2018-08-31 17:24:55 I found my old battery that I lost months ago n it had a cart on it w oil still in it, & it was still charged
3267 2018-08-31 17:24:37 And the shame in this is what, exactly?
3268 2018-08-31 17:24:30 Not just me then! You can buy cannabis oil in Holland and Barrett though (much to my amazement!)
3269 2018-08-31 17:24:20 Thank you!  Fine company indeed
3270 2018-08-31 17:24:18 Oil drilling.
3271 2018-08-31 17:24:18 I can see how you’d think that but I wasn’t referring to oil or lithium. Just generally that South America has some very real financial issues that seem to be spreading. What’s happening in Argentina right now bears a strong resemblance to the situation in Venezuela.
3272 2018-08-31 17:24:18 Price of oil has rebounded from a low in the $20 range to $70. US is booming with the same oil prices. Our Govt wants to brag about their job growth which is BS, and you have a problem with those facts?

3277 2018-08-31 17:23:25 Didn't you see the nationalists claiming there were secret oilfields in the Clyde? We had great sport with that. Who owns the oil? You know Shetland wouldn't accept being part of a separatist Scotland? Where's your oil then?

3283 2018-08-31 17:22:40 Its a good news and much welcome news for the country. but there is no as such global turmoil as of now except oil price. u could have control the oil price in india by cutting duties if you and ur ministry would have not failed Demo deliberately.

3285 2018-08-31 17:22:34 I'll bring coconut oil as the natural alternative as well
3286 2018-08-31 17:22:30 He must not have the oil... 
3287 2018-08-31 17:22:22 Water power and wind power are natural and endless, clean natural resources. Don't be a Trump with just oil and coal on the brain.
3288 2018-08-31 17:22:14 But.. but.. but.. Saudis wouldn't profit off of Canada if you relied on your oil instead of theirs! The scheme is so clear...
3289 2018-08-31 17:22:14 Fully stocked here at farmers pike festival...and yes, my CBD products are here too! Stop in for some soothing CBD tea or gummies and pick up a bottle of CBD oil, too!
3290 2018-08-31 17:22:08 That will make food and everything else more expensive. In all fairness we are in serious trouble, the poor is hit the most. Oil price at $77 now, prediction for midyear 2019 up to possible R121 !?! (R/$ prediction more or less as current)
3291 2018-08-31 17:21:58 Why are we buying 60% of oil from the USA and 30% from Saudi Arabia instead of using a pipeline to refineries in Canada?
3292 2018-08-31 17:21:56 Keep on clear cutting your forests, flooding your valleys, and mining your coal BC. And enjoy the increasing number train derailments as oil is being moved through the National Parks and down to the US by rail cars.

3294 2018-08-31 17:21:43 True. And a lot is based on mental illness. However, by the government's analysis 20B dollars would essentially eliminate homeless (not sure if annually). Anually we give between 10B to 52B in oil subsidies. We have the money, we just use it poorly.
3295 2018-08-31 17:21:42 It’s called public sector growth, while the private sector shrank. It takes 8-10 private sector jobs to fund one public sector job, add lost revenue from lost investment and lower royalties, from much lower oil prices ... it’s not hard to figure out how this happened.
3296 2018-08-31 17:21:41 Really? Why not reassure First Nations that their rights will be respected? Why not reassure thousands, perhaps millions of Canadians who care about #climatechange & the environment that Canada's Paris Agreement pledges fill be fulfilled by not extracting oil, building pipelines?
3297 2018-08-31 17:21:38 I don't want to stop drilling for oil and natural gas get you going to these new homes or do they have gas stoves gas fireplace don't be surprised when the price goes up
3298 2018-08-31 17:21:15 This cbd oil tastes like pencils
3299 2018-08-31 17:21:14 i have a serious addiction. There's a great video called $21k oil change.
3300 2018-08-31 17:21:12 My guess is that oil prices won’t eat much of growth and it should be between 7.5-7.75% for next 3-4 quarters unless something drastic beyond the current trend in tariffs/ hike in rates or oil prices
3301 2018-08-31 17:21:12 Right?  They can't even see Bobby's grift. Lol
3302 2018-08-31 17:21:06 Parasites moving into lands where impressionable war lord types will sell their people out for oil and gas wealth, like they did in the past. The US & israel are ALREADY in half of Africa's officially AND unofficially

US Military Colonialism at its best... Rinse and repeat.
3303 2018-08-31 17:21:06 reason .2
Crude oil prices have been increasing and since India imports most of its crude requirements, the larger import bill i.e. more dollars required, pressures Rupee lower.
3304 2018-08-31 17:20:58 The high cost of low prices. When you factor in this, climate change, and the military efforts required to secure oil along with the subsidies and probably other financial incentives given to the oil industry the cost of oil is many times more than is. Generally appreciated.
3305 2018-08-31 17:20:53 . Well, I have some & use 27 drops when my back hurts so bad I can’t stand it. It’s an oil ... HEMPWORX 500 with pure CBD oil & herbal drops natural flavor. It was a gift & it works for me. I use it only on very painful days... might Bing it.

3318 2018-08-31 17:19:48 The “olive oil with a questionable past” joke from Zack and Cody has stuck with me for years.
3319 2018-08-31 17:19:37 Do you understand we don’t have the infrastructure in place nationally to accomplish this? And the oil revenues would aid in addressing deloping countries infrastructure too? Canada is but a pittance in the offender category, but we could be a leader in green energy worldwide.

3330 2018-08-31 17:18:50 So very true.....I put mine in a oil, vinegar and mustard dressing then add garlic and finely cut parsley....heaven.....
3331 2018-08-31 17:18:49 People are so naive, it’s not as simple as you think. This isn’t a win for the oil companies. Alberta gets only 2% back in royalties thanks to @RachelNotley . Texas oil WILL get the #tarsands .they will just pipe it south. There is no win for Canada.
3332 2018-08-31 17:18:48 Global renewable energy subsidies reached $88 billion in 2011.[19] Seems oil, gas and coal are the ones really sucking at the teat with 5.3 trillion in subsidies in 2015

3390 2018-09-02 23:55:36 NAFTA Energy Proportionality clause (article 605) virtually gave US access to our exported oil, gas and electricity and they have taken advantage of it by paying up to 35% less. For some reason some Canadians are silent about it. México is exempt.

3399 2018-09-02 23:54:31 I uh...I thought it was like motor oil or something car related...
3400 2018-09-02 23:54:09 I guess my question is more: why are you using Pride as an opportunity to promote oil corporations
3401 2018-09-02 23:53:51 Issues with cars: kills people, clogs roads, kills people, climate change, kills people, fuels the entire oil industry, kills people

But yeah, let's significantly hinder these alternatives while we let ride sharing run completely amok
3402 2018-09-02 23:53:46 14 That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil. 
Deuteronomy 11:14
3403 2018-09-02 23:53:41 But if the project is really about the twinning of the line to Westridge and shipping oil to Asia, shouldn’t it? 

For all the reasons identified in the report and others that should have been in, but weren’t.

Not sure why @MrCanucklehead blocked me and not you, oh well!
3404 2018-09-02 23:53:30 Hot Laps for Lucas Oil ASCS have wrapped up. Lucas Oil POWRi Midgets are up.
3405 2018-09-02 23:53:18 Stop deflecting. One main solution. Stop using so
much oil. The base issue here is #ClimateChange Address that and you take care of every other issue
3406 2018-09-02 23:52:59 Ok, so another wild and completely unsubstantiated assertion without a shred of evidence. Clearly he was beholden to them when he approved defensive arms to Ukraine, bombed their mercenaries in Syria, sanctioned their client-state Iran, and lessened our dependence on their oil.
3407 2018-09-02 23:52:49 lmaooo i just think it clashes with a lot of toppings or takes away from them idk. i prefer like a garlic olive oil base lol
3408 2018-09-02 23:52:34 かいさんおはごです！
3409 2018-09-02 23:52:22 If you don't have enough time for a full shower shaving session, just smooth baby oil onto your legs before you take the razor to them.
3410 2018-09-02 23:52:14 What is worse for marine life, a slim chance of an oil spill or consistently swimming through raw sewage from bc’s capital?
3411 2018-09-02 23:52:03 Oil companies, Financial institutions, Insurance companies & ofcourse the tech companies in California are employing enormous (1 million above) foreign labor for white collar jobs. Many of the jobs are in the IT sector both fulltime & temporary employment untouched by Prez Trump
3412 2018-09-02 23:51:59 They seem to have lost the Budweiser and motor oil crowd. I don’t think anyone knows what happened.
3413 2018-09-02 23:51:57 i need an oil change 
3414 2018-09-02 23:51:50 Eu "Sure Scotland , we love you come on in , but yer pal wi the brexit trainers oan kin dae wan".

I just hope they take more than 92% of oor oil , we will need their broad shoulders , and have at least one Trident to park in the Clyde or we are fucked!!!
3415 2018-09-02 23:51:26 Great point Dick. It’s that pathetic “can’t do” mentality that always drags us back. If we adhered to it the oil would still be untapped below the North Sea.
3416 2018-09-02 23:51:23 Oil prices came down because fracking and what have you made the U.S. the world's top oil producer. And whatever the oil price, Venezuela's oil production crashed years ago, likely because no one owns their oil industry and invests in maintenance of the equipment.
3417 2018-09-02 23:51:07 It boggles my mind about all of this. Australia should be an energy superpower with our reserves of coal, uranium, gas and yes even our oil reserves that no one talks about, instead, we have some of the worlds highest energy prices and least reliability of supply, please explain
3418 2018-09-02 23:51:04 But honestly just know that when the grains  of oil enters the exit then toilet roll definitely can’t do hand flip stand with dedication of the level of Oak yrees that but why do that when you can fly to the next kfc on grmtv but you ugly so you yo daft gc helicopters and cheese
3419 2018-09-02 23:50:50 I fried stuff for like 2 hours in canola over canola oil's smoking temp and my eyes hurt
3420 2018-09-02 23:50:49 Yet these manufacturing jobs, just like coal & oil jobs, aren’t being filled! Yes, thousands of low paying, no benefit jobs have been created but aren’t being filled! People want & deserve better higher paying jobs. That’s why they voted Trump & he failed. Min wage jobs SUCK!
3421 2018-09-02 23:50:21 I would not be here today, if my Grand Father did not come to Trinidad From Scotland to
Work in the oil fields .
3422 2018-09-02 23:50:20 Ed Orgeron should be checking oil levels for 18-wheelers at a nameless truck stop... not coaching a college football team.
3423 2018-09-02 23:50:12 You never see anything....
3424 2018-09-02 23:49:53 They need to sign or kiss our Auto industry goodbye. But he couldn't care a less about 8000 oil workers. So he is dumb enough not to. 20 to 25 percent tariff will force auto industry back to USA.
3425 2018-09-02 23:49:42 Did a oil change on gf’s car and now chill time.
3426 2018-09-02 23:49:33 هههههههه ليش نص الرؤية يابوسمل مطرودين من التغيير بعد ماصاحبكم سرق القطيه والثاني صاحب قروب الوعله سرق التواقيع واطردوهم التغيير الله يسامحك تخليني دايم انزل مستواك ولاتكثر عشان ماافظح بعد ويستانس زكريا ابوالملحدين

3429 2018-09-02 23:48:30 @lushcosmetics Hello, I had a customer service complaint. I bought a hot oil treatment, spicy scalp one and I saw a sample of how to use it at the store. I bought it and tried it at home. It just wouldn’t melt. It left so many small lumps. Unsatisfactory!
3430 2018-09-02 23:48:15 This is completely false... did you read the article you had screenshot? He didn’t want to tie it to oil taxes in an “unsustainable industry” I thought the left was all for acknowledging this? 
3431 2018-09-02 23:48:05 Oil being halfway cheaper in Somali than it is in Kenya is the greatest joke of the century
3432 2018-09-02 23:48:05 News flash We need Air and Water to live, Humans lived pretty damn well Without Oil and Gas, since he Beginning time, and we Can find ways to live Without it!.
3433 2018-09-02 23:48:01 time to blow up pigs for the oil trade
3434 2018-09-02 23:47:58 And the Matrix/Vibe wasn't that great of a car. Every person I know with one (granted only 6-7) has had major issues with the car. I've seen engine issues, oil leaks, etc.
3435 2018-09-02 23:47:45 I regret to inform you that up-and-coming SoundCloud rapper "Yung $krote" has died after wandering into an anvil testing facility. 

This, in turn, was caused after he lost his sense of direction from a cod liver oil overdose
3436 2018-09-02 23:47:23 Sweet potato fries? Toss in miso paste that has been turned into a oil like consistency with sesame oil and a little Kirin.

Then add salt and bake at 450 in a single layer until browned.

Not sure if it qualifies as true baking or satiates your desire.
3437 2018-09-02 23:47:22 Helping my brother move and in his bedroom he has parts cleaner, penetrating oil, nut buster, and 30w #lubrication

3443 2018-09-02 23:46:38 Using too much oil or products on your curly hair creates a barrier, which ends up blocking the moisture that your hair needs. Aka leaving your hair dry. I just learned this today so I’m sharing my knowledge to my fellow curly head beauties.

3448 2018-09-02 23:45:58 UN Code 1267 is 100% for oil cant be anything more anything less simple as that! Facts are facts get them right before you post nonsense #UKOG 
3449 2018-09-02 23:45:15 I put my drag car into the wall at 157mph, lost the use of my legs for 3 years at 30. Had A spinal tap. I have advanced neuropathy in my legs, I can't wear socks, it just hurts to much. I am on my feet at my job. I recently started CBD Oil medical grade, and it helps the pain
3450 2018-09-02 23:44:53 So what are we gonna do with that that oil surplus?
3451 2018-09-02 23:44:53 Thank you.  Fortunately once I got some rest it cleared up. I’m definitely trying peppermint oil next time!
3452 2018-09-02 23:44:44 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
3453 2018-09-02 23:43:58 if anyone has suggestions for a theme i should try with the oil pastels tonight hmu
3454 2018-09-02 23:43:58 Is that Q8 as in "you'll need to run a small oil rich country to afford the bills"?
3455 2018-09-02 23:43:54 Well, the Saudis wanted their own oil/gas pipeline thru Syria to Europe and the  US Hillary/Obama regime wanted what the Saudis wanted.
As detailed in todays and other Sorcha reports for years  now.
Goota read all the article and  those linked in it - And previous reports too.
3456 2018-09-02 23:43:43 めっちゃ面白そう／(^o^)＼笑笑
3457 2018-09-02 23:43:35 God put oil in the Earth as a gift. Don’t try to play God. He doesn’t like that. Be warned.
3458 2018-09-02 23:43:30 I went to the blick store in Fullerton to try to find the oil painting class supplies I need.

Not only did they lack the vast majority of what I need, but the few things I needed ran me up $100
3459 2018-09-02 23:43:11 The image popped into my mind and so I did a fast sketch in oil. I do see these types of figures in dreams.
3460 2018-09-02 23:42:51 No one but the US and the British can get oil  out of the ground. That’s the real trick of it  all.
3461 2018-09-02 23:42:44 I miss not having to jack up my truck to change the oil... car problems
3462 2018-09-02 23:42:09 .
Imperial Oil?
.
3463 2018-09-02 23:42:04 Hmm that one is shaitan work thats why dey dont complaint it
3464 2018-09-02 23:41:58 Snake oil.
3465 2018-09-02 23:41:42 Tell me how @lilfairykitten got our entire hotel room to put peppermint essential oil on our nips
Holy fuck they he tingley
3466 2018-09-02 23:41:25 Spot on young investor, I don’t remember seeing any tankers in the south Atlantic in 2010, just a leaky ship that appeared to get manipulated.....oil to brackish water in a weekend wasn’t it, I did get badly caught out on that one, hence the reason why we owe the hh 3 loads
3467 2018-09-02 23:41:14 See also: doing dishes, laundry, cooking, cleaning, replacing shingles, replacing toilets, plunging bathtubs/toilets/sinks, exercise, cutting the grass, doing your oil changes, shoveling snow, growing vegetable gardens, building shit from Ikea... etc...
3468 2018-09-02 23:41:11 So much prep + planning! But so worth it. I decanted a small portion of the Regulus oil into a couple of smaller bottles for travel - in a sun hour of course. A truly life affirming -  and changing - product.
3469 2018-09-02 23:41:02 There might be the world's largest ocean oil spill fire off of San Paulo.
3470 2018-09-02 23:40:59 Then why did you sell out to big oil drilling the Alaka frontier if your so energy conservative? Hypocritical much? Kind of defeats the pupose in case you forgot Exon Valdez disaster!!
3471 2018-09-02 23:40:58 -- lost, you might as well stay at my place! We have food-

Wait, but we don't have oil for you." scratches her head.
3472 2018-09-02 23:40:37 @Turin_Luca can you explain (in 130 characters) why aldehyde in perfume smell so great but are by product of frying oil which can kill you
3473 2018-09-02 23:40:36 Northern States are not Parasite.
They are the same as our southern states.
Let me Proof

Southern states depends fully on Oil, govs wait for monthly allocation 

The same goes for the North, they sit waiting for allocation coming in and not utilising their agricultural potential

3475 2018-09-02 23:40:32 Laying down that Bond oil slick would be the bomb too.
3476 2018-09-02 23:40:29 He run his fingers through his hair, accidentally making some strands go up.

“Probably the oil that made it like that-“
He should really wash his hair.

“Wait up-“
And he enters his bathroom. Yeah, he’s going to wash his hair in the sink.
3477 2018-09-02 23:40:18 We’ve been living happily without selling oil to Asia all along, up until now. 

We don’t have to start doing that!

3482 2018-09-02 23:40:03 impulse bought some mackerel only to discover it was in sunflower oil 
3483 2018-09-02 23:39:57 Had a good day today! Me and my husband got the oil changed in the car, and it was like a 2 hour wait, cause it was really packed, so we went to Longehorne Steakhouse for lunch! I had THE BEST chopped sirloin burger! ( ( but then again Ive never had a Wahlburger either..... 
3484 2018-09-02 23:39:46 We usually have yoghurt based dressings or just vinegar and oil. I kinda like all of them, just don't like the green parts of the actual salad 
3485 2018-09-02 23:39:23 Um why is your only shout-out to Imperial Oil ?
3486 2018-09-02 23:39:08 ต้องหล่อด้วย
3487 2018-09-02 23:39:03 I might tip a ride share driver for the first time ever. This nigga is driving fast AF, took the toll road, DJing his ass off via you tube, he got on shades, and he definitely got the oil plug cause it smell like knockoff designer cologne in here
3488 2018-09-02 23:39:01 I don;t know anyone with real fibro that doesn't take pain meds or tries things like CBD oil
3489 2018-09-02 23:38:25 a world in which data is more valuable than oil is a legitimate possibility.
3490 2018-09-02 23:38:05 They are. You did well there Aaron! That photo with the oil rig is excellent. Colours are sublime!
3491 2018-09-02 23:37:56 Yup. I'm tired of people who know nothing about the upstream oil and gas industry trying to be the loudest voices in the room. Repeating something often enough does not make it true. Fyi, tar is derived from coal, bitumen is derived from bitumous sand.
3492 2018-09-02 23:37:51 Oh gosh I even got a baguette to cut into slices to dip with the soup and olive oil and yup I think dinners gonna be great

3495 2018-09-02 23:37:02 I just use sugar and coconut oil. But I know you can put EOs in there too. Honey is good for a facial scrub.
3496 2018-09-02 23:36:39 will it be oil? 30 years? 50?
3497 2018-09-02 23:36:26 I feel like big pharma has surpassed big oil.
3498 2018-09-02 23:36:24 If you think she did such a great job what are you personally planning to do to help 8,000 unemployed oil workers.  Perhaps you could give one of them your job.  If not, why not.
3499 2018-09-02 23:36:19 You have to be slick as oil to sell solar panels in the hood!
3500 2018-09-02 23:36:04 Don't you all tell Paula Dean that I cooked chicken fried steak with no oil! You all know she my Southern Cooking she-ro! YES SHE IS!
3501 2018-09-02 23:35:56 Yup - olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, salt, pepper all blended up
3502 2018-09-02 23:35:44 Mine is dry and flaky,body shop argan oil bath gel,body scrub and body butter doing the damn things for me. I tried so many things before this.
3503 2018-09-02 23:35:31 What i saw was increased taxes that were not talked about during their campaign.  At the peak of the lay offs in ab they closed up shop. went to bc to campaign for them. Look what that got us. Then the biggest slap was hiring the biggest oil and gas hater of all time  Tzeporah
3504 2018-09-02 23:35:30 @CHAZDEAN will you ever bring Fall Apple Spice cc, replenishing mist and oil back to QVC? I LOVE that one !!!
3505 2018-09-02 23:35:29 Refine the oil in Alberta and pipe the gasoline to the coast?
3506 2018-09-02 23:35:10 Treat family better.  We have been helping each other out for a long time.  Oil at 2/3 cost , precious metals mined by U.S. owned companies and sold to U.S. markets, power supplies at pennies on the dollar.  Our markets 
help  each other.  We still love you.
3507 2018-09-02 23:35:08 another thing that i like about myself is that when i procrastinate i furiously reorganize my entire life for 4 hours without stopping so now my room smells like peppermint essential oil and my brain is ready to do work? maybe
3508 2018-09-02 23:35:01 Which two?? That’s brave, but tea tree oil in advance mate
3509 2018-09-02 23:34:55 Baking soda and warm water as your shampoo and apple cider vinegar with warm as conditioner 
It’s like the best thing I ever used and my hair is thin and gets oily rel fast and this thickens your hair, help it grow faster and keeps it fresh and oil free much longer
3510 2018-09-02 23:34:35 Yup all in Washington
3511 2018-09-02 23:34:26 Cooking oil
3512 2018-09-02 23:34:22 That's not how global markets work. There are many economies based heavily on oil, and their countries aren't collapsing. Additionally, you're suggesting many countries that desperately need the revenue themselves are all colluding to take down Venezuela. Irrational nonsense.
3513 2018-09-02 23:34:16 Not outside the scope at all. 

@JustinTrudeau @Bill_Morneau & @JimCarrey have all said publicly and repeatedly that the #TMX is about shipping oil to Asia, to make up for this $15B / year they think we’re missing out on by selling only to the US.
3514 2018-09-02 23:34:16 Are you planning to give you job to an unemployed oil worker?  If not, you should shut up.
3515 2018-09-02 23:34:08 That's my next mission, mayo lol... I looked today at ingredients of the olive oil one and put it back with disgust... canola oil...

3517 2018-09-02 23:34:06 "Olive oil."
3518 2018-09-02 23:34:01 Ya no kidding. 2nd farthest field from home or town and blew a hose and 2 pails of oil 10ac in. Drives me 
3519 2018-09-02 23:33:50 Freshly naired legs. The oil them thangs up. So smooth lol
3520 2018-09-02 23:33:47 If Rex tries to carry any more water for the oil industry, he's going to need a tanker truck.
3521 2018-09-02 23:33:13 Hockey rinks are melting? Oil is on its deathbed???? WTF? No wonder trudeau got elected in this country. Get a grip.
3522 2018-09-02 23:33:01 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
3523 2018-09-02 23:32:38 Because Big Petro wants to make a few billion dollars more before the oil runs out
3524 2018-09-02 23:32:23 My BP has been elevated all summer, even with medication. It's gotten a lot better since I stopped reading most news articles about the Twat-In-Chief. I scan headlines and just read the Daily 202 in the WP,  and am much better for it. Oh, and black seed oil helps too.
3525 2018-09-02 23:32:18 Still waiting to hear if you will give a large portion of your salary to help Alberta oil workers.  Why don't you answer some real questions once and a while.

3528 2018-09-02 23:31:25 When truffle oil was a new thing (at least in the anglophone corner of the world), and was being abused in otherwise reputable kitchens, there were restaurants where upon crossing the threshold I'd specify "No truffle oil, please."

3533 2018-09-02 23:30:39 @YankeeCandleEu I hate throwing away the glass after using your candles, oil diffuser ect. Is there a way that you guys can do something like "If you bring in 10 empty Yankee Candle candle glass/oils/diffusers ect. Get a free item" I think it will be a cool idea.
3534 2018-09-02 23:30:34 @dpradhanbjp does the govt really require any "excuse" to increase the price of fuel??? Even when the oil price was low & the rupee was stronger, fuel prices were increased more than it was decreased!!!! Why is the govt hesitating to bring fuel under GST???

3577 2018-09-02 23:22:50 It mostly says that infrastructure doesn’t mean anything to US politicians. They get much more money from oil & gas and car manufacturer lobbies. We certainly have the technology and resources but politicians are paid to keep cars king.

The USA and Canada have refined oil products integration
3635 2018-09-02 23:13:04 Then why destroy ANWR with new roads, pipelines and drilling pads that destroy the environment forever?  You can restore attic tundra.  We have enough oil, keep pumping from well we have and developed additional along the way. Why new oil?
3636 2018-09-02 23:13:04 When they say to add olive oil slowly when making mayo, they really fuckin mean it
3637 2018-09-02 23:13:03 You protested against a pipeline that is environmentally less risky than the alternatives, provides opportunities for indigenous people and then have the nerve to say we need healing. At least try to understand the oil supply chain before spewing nonsense about it.

3646 2018-09-02 23:11:22 I've used some of the CBD oil products - I've found the infused lotions work some with my right arm. But I haven't tried THC, or a combo of the two but I've been reading a lot about the entourage effect and pain.

The O&G industry in Canada invests back in green energy. Consumption can be reduced but it will never be eliminated.

3668 2018-09-02 23:08:47 Seems u r under the influence of “honey” and “oil” otherwise wouldn’t have doubted someone’s credentials on the basis of religious inclination,don’t spread hatred! #SenselessTweets #SharjeelMemon
3669 2018-09-02 23:08:39 Friendly reminder that Bush started the Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The latter specifically with absolutely no cause and a lie propagated on Sunday talk shows to justify the death of millions of innocents for oil & natural resources. 

Seems like some of you are forgetting.
3670 2018-09-02 23:08:38 Have a great muddy shift and be safe Sherry! Good night Patriot Family! Oil never sleeps! Jesus will watch over us while we sleep and Sherry works!
3671 2018-09-02 23:08:05 :) I started this nameless account after being accused of being a shill. How can you be a shill when you’re anonymous? Opinion from a nobody. Not paid. No shares. Here because of my kids. Plus I hate seeing someone attacked who is currently our only hope at killing big oil ASAP
3672 2018-09-02 23:08:03 Once I get this realistic oil paint technique down, it’s overrrrrrr
3673 2018-09-02 23:07:53 and i KNOW they have been FIXING oil prices
3674 2018-09-02 23:07:53 Read what he said ro Judas about the expensive oil Ted.

3677 2018-09-02 23:07:38 @ your white boyfriend. it’s not good to strip natural oils from your hair daily, it results in the overproduction of oil 
3678 2018-09-02 23:07:28 Oil change is officially done. Took only 30 minutes. Woooo!

3680 2018-09-02 23:07:24 Extremely helpful, as the market is for crude oil.  Nobody wants our gasoline.  But many would love our crude oil.  And why not, we're the most ethical producer on the planet.  The world needs more Canada #cdnpoli

3682 2018-09-02 23:06:59 We all know Iraq was about oil, keeping it trading in Dollars, and finishing daddy's war... Americans are stupid... But let's not forget your Party joined him in bombing the shit out of that region in the name of regime change and a sexed up dossier.. ;)

3684 2018-09-02 23:06:44 Oil is a part of it. A drought and decline in manufacturing and agricultural production also contributed. Not to mention the socialist policies introduced by Chavez and continued by Maduro. Venezuela has been a government-controlled economy for decades. Never a real free market.
3685 2018-09-02 23:06:21 What other countries are going to intervene?  Why the U.S.?  It couldn’t be because of Venezuela’s massive oil reserves could it?  No... it just must be an old fashioned humanitarian military intervention - the kind our current government is known for.
3686 2018-09-02 23:06:17 Everyone always says what’s the smell omg I want it. It’s just nag champa oil

3689 2018-09-02 23:06:10 please point to another country or sub-sov territorty similar to AB, where oil & gas was 25% of GDP in 2013, that has seen investment "largely recover" from the oil crash

3692 2018-09-02 23:05:34 What about our illegitimate elections. The only reason they pretend to care about Venezuelan democracy is because of their vast oil reserves.
3693 2018-09-02 23:05:34 How about Germany says fuck off and tells the oil rich middle east Countries to take a few who take zero. Germany should drag that battle axe out of power, shes killed their people allowing aliens in who dont have a clue about Western Civilisation.

3699 2018-09-02 23:04:33 The anticipated Wall Street fall in the game illuminati will be after oil price is over 180$ most likely when people start making spaceships
3700 2018-09-02 23:04:18 Not True..exporting our oil is great for our economy. Please stop being Anti Canadian. You claim you are the voice for the environment,  you are not. All you do is complain about our oil and our economy. How about plastic bags. Great start in cleaning up our oceans. Shame on you
3701 2018-09-02 23:04:18 I will moisturize the shit out my hair then touch it before it all soaks in & have a hand full of straight oil lol.. Beyond irritating that's why niggas don't take care of they heads

3706 2018-09-02 23:03:22 Same case can be made for automobile and aviation industries, 100s of companies competed for market share, eventually less than a dozen survived the competition. Refining industry was even more extreme when it started, as Standard oil managed to capture 90%refining capacity...

3717 2018-09-02 23:02:18 It’s surprising what can be broken or screwed up during an oil change. I’ve had parts broken and once, the oil not actually replenished.

3736 2018-09-02 22:59:41 Not true, Energy East was a method of getting us off Saudi oil (supply the east and sell the excess). Most of the oil planned for EE was light/med crude and can currently be refined in ON and NB. Is exporting CDN oil worse than importing Saudi oil?

These Arms should be used&tests somewhere, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Afghan...
3745 2018-09-02 22:57:43 Oh boy do I have one for you.... gold apparently exists in pine oil extract. But not just any gold, this was a special spin state undetectable by any known laboratory methods. Pine oils a goldmine!
3746 2018-09-02 22:57:41 Ripley took a bath in my bathtub last night & used conditioner instead of body wash and now I’m pretty sure I know what it would feel like to swim in an oil soaked ocean. Guess I don’t need to see the Texas gulf shores anymore.
3747 2018-09-02 22:57:35 5) Alberta already refines more than it needs and existing refineries are at full capacity. You’d be destroying your own refining industry by causing a glut locally. Up to 39 per cent of Alberta’s oil production is upgraded into a product that can move through pipelines.

3753 2018-09-02 22:57:26 Maybe because oil is such a boom & bust industry oil workers need to learn to live on $50,000 like most Canadians during the boom years so they can make it through the busy years. I’m just sayin have they never learned about filling their grainery for those tough years?
3754 2018-09-02 22:57:26 And what exactly did you do to facilitate this much needed bypass?? Should have been built 40 years ago! I worked on King Street mid 90's, nightmare then with fish and livestock lorries plus wide loads with oil pipeline. Long overdue. Thanks to SNP for getting the job done.
3755 2018-09-02 22:57:16 Don't waste time focusing on climate when US always need wars for oil.

Meanwhile @ home, tens of millions of citizens have no homes, hungry, broke / in debt, highly addicted to drugs,

who will save US from itself?

Watch your terrorists overseas @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump
3756 2018-09-02 22:57:10 I could imagine a Texas cowgirl (or oil girl?) paying big bucks to have something like that on her handbag.
3757 2018-09-02 22:56:06 You gotta manscape nowadays, but before marriage I never spritzed my balls with witch hazel and tea tree oil. 

Now I understand the cliche that married men are a temptation. It’s because wives make you keep your junk fresh.
3758 2018-09-02 22:56:05 3) Dilbit (any heavy oil) is more versatile than light, tight shale oil to a refiner.
4) North America has enough refining capacity for existing production. The problem is a lack of pipeline capacity to ship it.

3765 2018-09-02 22:55:03 You clearly have no experience in upstream oil & gas, what factors can lead to high carbon intensity, or what fracturing is. You just keep on thinking other countries offer "cleaner" oil because they have more conventional reservoirs. Ignore flaring, venting, fugitive emissions.
3766 2018-09-02 22:55:01 Majority of our ministry should occur outside of church walls.  It’s happens with our everyday interactions. Our church houses serve as places to restore, refresh and recharge us. Our oil stations. A place we can wash our nets. We are fishermen.
3767 2018-09-02 22:54:59 Nigga just asked me can he rent some oil 
3768 2018-09-02 22:54:51 Very good boots over fuel/oil. Roadways may be prone to check points and ambushes. Alcohol, weed, and cigarettes for personal use and currency.
3769 2018-09-02 22:54:43 Not just oil - a particularly shitty grade of crude that shouldn’t be economic at today’s prices - BUT - also happens to be the precise shitty grade our gulf coast refineries are built to process. 
We want it sent here for refining, on our terms.
3770 2018-09-02 22:54:38 I agree with you. I think the headline is a bit misleading, which is entirely my fault. The point of the book is yours - how much oil and gas would we produce if companies had to live within cash flow?
3771 2018-09-02 22:54:02 Also, I think it is time to switch over from almond oil to another. That same thing happened when I was using coconut oil three years ago
3772 2018-09-02 22:53:42 Have you tried Castor oil? I’ve heard it’s nasty but works pretty well
3773 2018-09-02 22:53:36 My goodness!!! How much do they pay you guys for this??? Are herds men carrying arms or not? Are they supposed to? What is the correlation between herdsmen carrying arms and price of oil? Even if this is what they asked you to say, can’t you think outside the box? Shameful.
3774 2018-09-02 22:53:15 #amazon Workers at Amazon claim #harshconditions I guess my work conditions of plus 100 degrees blowing oil and shavings into my face was harsh but it was a job back in the day!
3775 2018-09-02 22:53:14 I have a functional movement disorder with muscle spasms and involuntary movements among other symptoms.

I found straight CBD did nothing for me. I currently vaporize high THC strains exclusively and only supplement with CBD oil for anxiety and anti-inflammatory help.

#ACMPR
3776 2018-09-02 22:53:05 Yup. I think what people have missed is why Wall Street keeps funding it, which I try to explain. The real question is how much oil and gas would America produce if companies had to live within cash flow?
3777 2018-09-02 22:53:04 Do you even know what NAFTA stands for?   If you don’t  want a deal then maybe we should shut off your electricity from Quebec and your oil from Alberta and watch your economy come to a crawl.
3778 2018-09-02 22:52:40 @WstonesKingston I came into your store today to return a hardback book as I am allergic to rapeseed oil they use it to make pages shiney. The 2 people behind the desk asked questions about my allergy so they might better understand. Was nice they cared. #sayinggoodbye
3779 2018-09-02 22:52:22 Coconut oil, my brothers.
3780 2018-09-02 22:52:15 Demand for oil isn't falling.  It might in the next recession...but it isn't now.  Shale production declines rapidly it's first 3-5 years and that same rapid decline would help markets balance more quickly in the event of demand destruction.
3781 2018-09-02 22:52:10 50 dollars for a 4oz jar of curl butter and coconut oil yeah that woman lost her mind
3782 2018-09-02 22:51:56 Gave my baby a hot oil massage last night  she deserved it.
3783 2018-09-02 22:51:46 I believe in speaking the truth in love, so I told my friend that this video of this Lance Wallnau character is a nutjob and the 'New Apostolic Reformation' are a bunch of hucksters and snake oil salesmen.
3784 2018-09-02 22:51:33 Doesn't cbd oil work? B4 I knew about cbd oil, I used clove oil...and 800 mg ibuprofen
3785 2018-09-02 22:51:30 No. The powers that be, consider brown people in far off lands to be simply less legitimate as human beings. Unless, of course, they're sitting on a shed load of oil and are eager to do business - then they are simply wonderful creatures to be adored and adorned.
3786 2018-09-02 22:51:28 No. Labor Day should feature proletariat themes/colors: Oil. Grease. Unionizing.
3787 2018-09-02 22:51:19 1) Oil extraction is the single most profitable component of the oil supply chain and creates more value than any other Canadian industry including refining. 15 times higher than the national average. 
2) Can't compete with USA and China refineries which are already paid for.

3789 2018-09-02 22:50:24 Israel & Turkey are also guilty as they both aid the US in their attempt to take over Syria to seize all their oil and a share of Syrian land each. I strongly believe that Turkey and Israel are working together, despite Erdogan's comments about the US. Both support jihadi groups.
3790 2018-09-02 22:50:10 I expect some sort of deal given the potential and also the focus on North Sea oil at present. Plus the whol development infrastructure makes sense.
3791 2018-09-02 22:50:10 Never learning about basic car maintenance and servicing isn’t cute. At the very least know how to check your oil and learn what the dash lights mean. There I said it. I feel better.
3792 2018-09-02 22:50:08 “Decency?” One killed a million Iraqis to fill his families banks with oil money. The other bombed 8 Countries so he could overrun Europe with militant Muslims now Europe is destroyed. Great people indeed

3799 2018-09-02 22:49:24 Good point.

Can anyone convince me how one extra oil tanker per day being guided very slowly by tug boats and operating using GPS navigation is any worse than the current fleet of whale watching boats buzzing around these whales like mosquitos?
3800 2018-09-02 22:49:15 insane people in what you once called florida CNN is that set up to be able to walk to food and water? would that not have made more sense in terms of fuel? idk you people burn more gasoline than heating oil I think
3801 2018-09-02 22:49:13 Baguette, extra virgin olive oil, garlic salt, and ground black peppercorn.

3803 2018-09-02 22:48:40 DUDE! I switched from oil to watercolor and then tube watercolor to pan after I got a Real Career for progressive savings in setup/teardown effort. Another downside of physical mediums: cats stepping in EVERYTHING 
3804 2018-09-02 22:48:25 Carburetor cleaner, some q-tips, and then a liberal coating of 30 weight motor oil
3805 2018-09-02 22:48:09 I replace butter with coconut oil.  It turns over much easier after a quick yoga session or a round of air squats, pushups, situps & a run.  Butter tends to stick around. With quinoa it is a matter of getting the benefits while flavoring it right.
3806 2018-09-02 22:47:47 I shop at Amazon for the same reason I shop at Walmart, eat at McDonald's, and get my oil changed at Mr Lube. It's convenient, price competitive. Supporting local businesses is good, but global trade is good. Canada exports lots of stuff too.
3807 2018-09-02 22:47:47 Please explain how sustainable resources can replace fossil fuels. The tech to store energy doesn't exist nor does the tech to use sustainable fuels on planes, trains, and ships. Do we ignore these facts? And use Saudi oil while we do?

3809 2018-09-02 22:47:46 A spoonful of olive oil a day keeps your skin smooth af.
3810 2018-09-02 22:47:24 それは違う
3811 2018-09-02 22:47:24 Exactly. Not quite an "oil boom" when it's fracking. Midland has seen this before and the hype can turn on a dime, ruining whole areas of M-O and its economy that turn into ghost towns. And this is WEST TEXAS. Ain't nothin there but dirt, wind and water restrictions.
3812 2018-09-02 22:47:20 Hey Twitter. Can you put alittle oil on your scrolling mechanism? Slag-Dragging all day.
3813 2018-09-02 22:47:02 I always get a kick out of Oil protestors, seeing their electronics in use, seeing what they are wearing, all containing some amounts of oil in the plastics & fibers....guess they didn’t take Science in High School?...
3814 2018-09-02 22:46:52 Even here in Alaska, the Repubs have bankrupted the State, our #PermanentFund (percentage of oil taken by oil companies to residents) has been sliced & diced to prop-up the bottom line. So WHY do Alaskans still vote for ppl like @AkGovBillWalker and @repdonyoung or (R) senators?
3815 2018-09-02 22:46:50 Me and doggie eating dry rub air fried lamb chops and asparagus sauteed in sea salt, cracked black pepper and truffle oil. Shortbread cookies were the appetizers
3816 2018-09-02 22:46:48 Till date nothing has really changed. If the oil sector crashes again, our economy will crash. We are a country that imports everything even what we use. CBN has been pumping millions of dollars into the economy since 2017, for how long?
3817 2018-09-02 22:46:37 I am not surprised. She has made it clear that she hates oil workers. They are mostly men.
3818 2018-09-02 22:46:36 They just need to add Trump to the #Resistance and we'll be done with this whole mess and can get back to American war for oil, torture as policy, record inequality and ignoring global climate change with media heroes.
3819 2018-09-02 22:46:15 What kind of oil y’all use to massage these niggasI’m asking for a friend
3820 2018-09-02 22:45:58 And of course sanctions on Iranian oil by Trump, would be in Russia's interests
3821 2018-09-02 22:45:57 13775 words, 51 pages. Churnin' & burnin'! And while it doesn't matter what my hair looks like for another 24 hours, giving myself a coconut oil treatment!  #3daynovelcontest #3dnc #3daynovel
3822 2018-09-02 22:45:54 Any chemists out there; Sharjeel Memon wants to know if olive oil and honey can ferment into alcohol if kept in a fridge for a couple of weeks?

Focus on Sharjeel's big crimes - stop worrying about his drinking. This is a classic case of red herring.
3823 2018-09-02 22:45:51 What I’d like to see is a @Tesla at each driving school around the world! There’s children growing up today that will have no idea what a smelly oil and gas car is!!
3824 2018-09-02 22:45:15 Apc die hard. Suffering and smiling. We die here   not me sha 
3825 2018-09-02 22:45:05 Yes, that, too. And that's only one part of them oral argument against imported oil.

3828 2018-09-02 22:44:58 Just ask Norway and the UK. What happens to social programs if they don’t have oil?
3829 2018-09-02 22:44:58 I can’t find my oil pen :(
3830 2018-09-02 22:44:58 I've loads of mosquito spray with me but will also try oil based moisturisers thank u!!
3831 2018-09-02 22:44:36 Can you state your source on this one?
3832 2018-09-02 22:44:30 Their whole budget is predicated on TMX, carbon tax and $80 oil. Sad bunch of tax and spenders.
3833 2018-09-02 22:44:26 I think he sold a shit tonne of snake oil and didn’t stick around to clean it up.

3836 2018-09-02 22:44:12 If the man with the grease can spill the oil that would be perfect
3837 2018-09-02 22:44:12 Big oil doesnt generate electricity morons... so uneducated
3838 2018-09-02 22:44:11 Why did they capture that pos
I think drowning in a vat of boiling oil would be too good for that pos

Ghayd prang ang sarap ng mang inasal. San pwede magpadeliver at this early morning with unli rice po pls and chicken oil
3840 2018-09-02 22:42:47 apparently cbd oil changes lives!!
3841 2018-09-02 22:42:41 There is a consensus that the #alliance_of_aggression is the first and last cause of the deterioration of the economic situation on #Yemen as it dominates the wealth of oil and gas, also impose a comprehensive siege on all incoming and outgoing to narrowing the screws on #Yemenis
3842 2018-09-02 22:42:41 We are investing. That doesn’t change the fact that we need oil and should be supplying our own instead of relying on foreign countries to provide it. We should be self reliant in regards to the energy sector. Canada isn’t the problem and Canadians shouldn’t suffer for it
3843 2018-09-02 22:42:34 Getting wine drunk watching an earth history documentary. Apparently ancient trees buried by rock is what we know as coal. And dead fish and plankton is what we know as oil. I wonder what our species would be millions of years from now.
3844 2018-09-02 22:42:13 Don't forget the tides foundation donates millions to obstruct the oil sands and pipeline in Canada.

قول اخطأوا يمكن ولكن لاتنكر شجاعتهم
3847 2018-09-02 22:41:52 It's really REALLY simple... so let me spell it out for you.  *IN CANADA* Digging or melting or fracking oil out of the ground produces a hell of a lot more CO2 than pumping it out from an oil field. So that will be the first to stop.  It's not rocket science. Deal with it.
3848 2018-09-02 22:41:46 We will remigrate many in the coming decade and we will eventually outlaw islam.

If i were you i would worry about oil. It's running out, not just that but we need less as we use ever more alternatives.

Soon the middle east is economicly interesting to none. Can you survive?
3849 2018-09-02 22:41:37 I personally use their Senja hair oil but there are other scents too. If you prefer without scent just use VCO. Just apply direct to hair after shower, massage it through the scalps. Enjoy!
3850 2018-09-02 22:41:36 Why is Ok to ship as much coal out of Canada as possible but not Oil?  Is the coal miners union UNIFOR?  That’s so odd that increased coal shipping is cool but NO oil.
3851 2018-09-02 22:41:21 Thanks. That makes sense. I bet that cinnamon oil was hot, hot!!
3852 2018-09-02 22:41:14 It’s time to start seizing the day

3853 2018-09-02 22:41:14 Israel is persecuting the Palestinians and playing the victim at the same time. They are robbing the Palestinians of land and freedom to live. If this was done in any other middle eastern country with oil and gold. The usa and uk would have deployed their military their by now.
3854 2018-09-02 22:40:58 if u get bitten by insects easily wear an oil based moisturizer/ suncream!!! roll on deo to stop your thighs or whatever rubbing together xo

3859 2018-09-02 22:39:47 My car oil was changed , car is washed and shiny and the windshield got the scratches fixed too ! #adultinglikeamother
3860 2018-09-02 22:39:34 As much as I dislike this premise, it is hard to argue.  As I look around my house there is nothing this is not impacted by oil.  

I guess the real question, for those of us who hunger for change, is what to do with this knowledge?
3861 2018-09-02 22:39:30 @PanoTheShow dude come on, Manchini an oil money fraud, Rooney a modern day great. Who gives a fuck about their body type 
3862 2018-09-02 22:39:23 Maybe I don’t got enough culture or whatever the case is, but I will NEVER be able to understand the logic of goin to a party to throw paint and oil on each other....like how is that fun?

3865 2018-09-02 22:38:53 @ramseyjtyler Hi, I'm 17 years old and I'm a man. I often use tea tree and lavender essential oil to treat my acne problems, but your study is very worrying to me! Will you advise me to stop using these essential oils immediately? What are the other risks? Thank you very much.
3866 2018-09-02 22:38:34 What is CBD oil and what is it used for?

3871 2018-09-02 22:37:54 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
3872 2018-09-02 22:37:38 How many oil refineries are there in the world do you think they're going to make special oil for each company get the fuck out of here all this car oil is is the same Mobil 1 ain't no better than no other oil it's a rip-off and their lawyers can kiss my ass
3873 2018-09-02 22:37:26 I’ve been extraordinarily busy the last little while.
1. I no longer work training developer for the construction/oil&gas industry. I need to work for something more ethical so now I work as a training developer for alcohol and cannabis. #yeg
3874 2018-09-02 22:37:21 very cheaper crude oil i barel 78 $ 159 litr 5245 indain rupees.
3875 2018-09-02 22:37:10 Bush dragged us into war in Iraq for OIL! The Terrorist weren’t even from Iraq. 15 of the 19 where from Saudi Arabia. He used 9/11 just to go into Iraq for Oil. He’s turned out to be a piece of s###! Was passing a note to Obama at the funeral. Real classy Bush!
3876 2018-09-02 22:37:05  I am so sorry you are suffering so horribly.  Ibuprofen will never work on nerve pain.  I take  Gabapentin and use Frankincense Essential Oil, it helps great for pain.. Blessings Xxx
3877 2018-09-02 22:36:45 Our country and you still have exactly what you’ve had, as in all your shit and you’re still in the same place. So take your oil dear

3879 2018-09-02 22:36:26 Zeytoon ky oil mey hahahaha

3881 2018-09-02 22:35:30 Thank you & I couldn't agree more. I use cbd oil these days and combine that with something called duloxitine for the depression and so far so good . Nice speaking to you too and fingers crossed you sleep well my friend. Take care
3882 2018-09-02 22:35:27 Nice use of buzz words. Russian and Nigerian oil falls into the conventional category, but they have higher GHG emissions because they flare/vent insane amounts of gas. It's not conventional vs. unconventional, it's total lifecycle GHG that matters.
3883 2018-09-02 22:35:13 That moment you spill the rest of your baby’s lavender essential oil and you question your whole life.

3887 2018-09-02 22:34:27 Venezuela has the largest proven Brent crude oil reserves in the world, 297.7 bbl. Some talking about doing what made America great, killing people to take their land and resources. Others say end oil addiction before it cooks us. Wonder who'd win a reason/science based debate.
3888 2018-09-02 22:34:22 These things happen  we used the herb and lemon oil with @AbernethyButter smoked butter to sauté our spinach
3889 2018-09-02 22:34:15 Air source heat pumps are meant to utilise air not oil surely?

3892 2018-09-02 22:33:48 Half of my shopping at trader Joe's is picking up things like a jar of roasted red peppers, seeing sugar or soy bean oil in the ingredients, saying "why???" out loud, and putting them back.
3893 2018-09-02 22:33:47 love pumpkin spice lattes? use @KrazyEssentials’ warm vanilla espresso body polish followed up with their pumpkin crunch dry body oil to smell like your favorite fall drink. 
3894 2018-09-02 22:33:20 Coconut oil. Seriously. It helps lubricate the vocal cords.

3896 2018-09-02 22:33:16 That articlel is two years old and super vague with a lot of uncertainties. And: "An important result is that oil demand will peak around 2030, at fewer than 100 million barrels per day in this scenario.". You know what goes bancrupt around that time at the latest? Canadian oil.
3897 2018-09-02 22:33:12 Oil prices are up...well at least higher than the benchmark,hence y foreign reserves have gone up. As 4recession,honestly I believe it was wen Buhari entered power n blocked off everywhere,foreign coys pulled out all their $$ et all,n no forex too dt caused d so called recession
3898 2018-09-02 22:32:44 CBD oil has been doing wonders for stabilizing my anxiety. I just take 3-5 drips as needed. I purchased mine from CBDistillery. 
3899 2018-09-02 22:32:38 Shell says 2040 or later, IF we start building lots of nuclear reactors.   Funny how the peak oil date is lining up with peak opoulation...

3903 2018-09-02 22:32:23 A very obnoxious piece. Needless to add that the writer of this piece had written obituaries of the @liberal_party several times over, it survived. @acoyne's often imbalance is glaring in this piece. Backing oil exploration and sound environmental policy are not diametrical.
3904 2018-09-02 22:32:07 And he has the nerve to refer to himself as a “man of science.”
I wonder which science he practices...witchcraft, voodo, alchemy, essential oil technology, homeopathy, exorcism, acupuncture? 
3905 2018-09-02 22:32:01 oil pastels and an 8b pencil!
3906 2018-09-02 22:31:55 Suncream suncream suncream, and reapply often even tho it feels gross. If ur sweaty every day, oil ur hair when u get home before u shower so u don’t strip it too much, and mostly just gently wash the scalp and not the ends. Baby shampoo is good~
3907 2018-09-02 22:31:52 I don't think that olive oil was as popular back then. But aside from that, we did indeed have the best of the best. Lol

3911 2018-09-02 22:31:26 This is the most darkest part how anti Muslim lobbies invaded Muslims countries one by one and destroy them eventually for the sake of oil and hidden mineral reserves.
3912 2018-09-02 22:31:20 So you just don't know how to read the graphs? Oilsands are not the dirtiest, and in terms of overall Environmental regulations you should be pushing oilsands instead of most other oil sources. Including the US.

3917 2018-09-02 22:30:45 That “privatization” is working so well in my state.  Last gop governor cut taxes so deep that when the oil recession hit, we ended up with a record deficit.  They privatized the charity hospital and the employees left were scared to death when the government had to cut even

3926 2018-09-02 22:29:23 Excited to spend my Labor Day hearing all about the advantages of CBD oil from my girlfriend’s friend’s new boyfriend.
3927 2018-09-02 22:29:00 Moderates would be the ones that fire missiles and bomb people who happen to live on top of oil and extremists those who don't?
3928 2018-09-02 22:28:59 Our GDP is heading down yet another slope and if Oil price doesn't increase soon we'd head back to recession. He thinks this government is performing magic to bring us out of recession. Nothing has changed. We are still heavily dependent on oil and still import necessaries.
3929 2018-09-02 22:28:46 I roast it with S & P & drizzled olive oil.
3930 2018-09-02 22:28:45 The 1/3rd is definitely the oil slick finish.
3931 2018-09-02 22:28:44 the man sounds like a snake oil salesman. solar is not for everybody.
3932 2018-09-02 22:28:39 So much better to use oil that's produced in other countries with less care towards the environment, don't you think?
3933 2018-09-02 22:28:39 Two key factors drive transition to smart services 1/Secular decline in EROEI caps oil/resource price & squeezes intermediaries. 2/Service provision is capital lite. So intellectual capital displaces energy & finance capital & mobility minimises use of costly urban land/location
3934 2018-09-02 22:28:03 Some of us grew up after voting Conservative for over 40 yrs. I also bought into the propaganda. It was hard to escape it working in the oil patch.
3935 2018-09-02 22:27:56 Eric the Car Guy is being sued by mobile one because he found out that their oil is no different than no other fuck mobile one try to sue me motherfukers
3936 2018-09-02 22:27:50 But I always wonder why is he loyal to his base. He has never shown an ability to be faithful to anything. We are all to be used by him. He is the classic snake oil salesman who is selling nothing more than urine in a bottle.
3937 2018-09-02 22:27:42 It’s all about the read, once they find out I work on oil rigs, Navy ships, it usually leads to a ton of questions about food, places to stay etc

3939 2018-09-02 22:27:36 Dwellers of the twering cliffs of Keiyo-Marakwet will soon benefit from the oil boom in the Kerio valley
3940 2018-09-02 22:27:35 @PopeyesChicken is Disgusting...shit taste like y’all been using the same oil for 50 years .Dry ass Biscuits dickheads ..
3941 2018-09-02 22:27:30 Also check the floor of where you park for fresh oil drops/puddle to check to see if you have a leak.
3942 2018-09-02 22:27:29 Look into products that has low sodium laurel sulfate (it’s what gives the product it’s foaming property) it takes away your natural oils that can make your skin produce more oil which throws it out of wack. Look into Aēsop “In Two Minds”, it worked wonders for my hormonal acne.
3943 2018-09-02 22:27:29 Your children and grandchildren will have no future - No clean air, no clean water, rampant pesticides, oil covered beaches, and work place safety rules removed. Thanks to your President.
3944 2018-09-02 22:27:21 The refineries in ON already benefit from the Line 9 reversal. Those in Quebec are already getting a lot of their feedstock from the US and Canada. Irving clearly noted that it would not be obliged to refine EE oil. The refinery in Come By Chance is a merchant operation.
3945 2018-09-02 22:27:20 I bet y'all is oil we use like Mobil 1 and Castrol oil is no better than the house brand oil just heard some guy who drives around in the circle for 500 miles says it's good they assume you should think it's good to
3946 2018-09-02 22:26:55 It’s all about the oil. Notice a pattern with countries fighting over oil/gas/pipelines.
3947 2018-09-02 22:26:50 When bitumen was flowing freely through the pipelines, why didn't they put away something for Albertans?  Notley, with greatly reduced oil revenues, is expected to do what the previous governments couldn't.  Where's the logic?  if you're going to judge, compare apples to apples.
3948 2018-09-02 22:26:45 Wrong! Refineries can be modified.  Do you prefer Saudi oil by tanker on the St Lawrence???

3950 2018-09-02 22:26:27 I spent my formative years in Calgary. Attended high School there and and worked in the oil industry. When you separate can I get citizenship?

3952 2018-09-02 22:26:22 Shortly after the so-called Syrian civil war (read intentional destabilization), Israel awarded oil rights in the Golan Heights (not their land, Syrian land they occupy illegally) to Genie Oil. Now... go Google Genie Oil’s board of advisors. Try not to throw up. #Syria #Israel
3953 2018-09-02 22:26:14 inside grill..wrapped in foil, with olive oil, butter and bread crumbs :)
3954 2018-09-02 22:26:12 Lmfao get fucked I burned my face on hot oil :>
3955 2018-09-02 22:26:05 How do we know these household chemicals supplies are really cleaning her house they need to do a study on that how do they know that expensive ass oil we buy for automobiles is really doing the trick or that expensive as gas what they do studies on that
3956 2018-09-02 22:26:00 I may have to break out the sledgehammer on the global oil & gas industry.

Again.

Where were we last time, at the bottom of the trough? $26/barrel?
3957 2018-09-02 22:25:55 Apart from oil was double the price, sea lion is many many times bigger than anything in uog portfolio and sentiment was on a different scale conpeltely in those days...... you may have a point
3958 2018-09-02 22:25:51 THAT OIL IS A BOMB!

3960 2018-09-02 22:25:38 @Royal_Purple what stores can you find your oil filters at?
3961 2018-09-02 22:25:22 Fucking the planet with refining bitumen is wrong!  Canada needs investment in alternatives and YES there is enough alternatives available.  Making oil products more expensive encourages alternatives!
3962 2018-09-02 22:25:20 Love that garlic & chili oil. Except for that one time it accidentally went in carrot cake batter 
3963 2018-09-02 22:25:08 7 k citizen frm Basrah does not have access 2 drinking water while its Iraq's richest province in Oil & Gas
3964 2018-09-02 22:25:07 Norway is a really interesting comparison for us. They have an economy built on fossil fuels (crude oil in their case) & have used that wealth to set up incentives for clean energy. Rather than being worried they are shooting themselves in the  they're setting up for the future

Pretty cool!
3967 2018-09-02 22:24:56 Low oil is ok. 80,000 miles is not a lot. Buy a quart of oil anywhere probably 10 W 30. Put in half, drive to any oil change place and have them change the oil. Today, tomorrow. Tuesday. Everything is fine.
3968 2018-09-02 22:24:55 These two are snake oil salesmen. Sad to know so many young people will prey victim to their false song of socialism. #RunJamesRun mop the floor clean of this scum!
3969 2018-09-02 22:24:36 Woke up AMPED. Creating flat out all morning trying to keep up with it. Fingers need to move faster. Might need an oil can. LOL.

3972 2018-09-02 22:24:14 Do analyse d criteria of Pple & SMEs or corporate banking bizs, oil & gas, telecoms dt ds loans go to. When u lend 2state govts or dr workers wht happens? Salaries r withheld 4 mths affecting repayments so banks need a buffer against such things wh don't presumably happen in d UK
3973 2018-09-02 22:24:11 Yes, and those are huge. And big oil industry doesn’t pay for the healthcare, for the diseases caused by the polluting particles. I’m not an environmentalist, I have driven ICE , but there is something lame  here.

3977 2018-09-02 22:23:03 Only Bo’s human form consumes. And when he does it’s a warm glass of oil fresh from a Kia. But I wouldn’t expect you to know that
3978 2018-09-02 22:22:51 Salad, turkey breast. Extra meat and cheese. All vegetables except capsicum, and chilli sauce, mustard, honey mustard, southwest and olive oil. Oh, and extra olives please.
3979 2018-09-02 22:22:47 Ok. Just remember that when we stop giving you oil at dirt prices. Coincidence that you guys are looking to Venezuela and now saying they need "freedom"? Hate Canada. But it's too bad that you don't realize how much we will always be enmeshed. Love you sweetie!
3980 2018-09-02 22:22:35 I went to a Jon Stewart show about 15 years ago. He was talking about how we only start wars with countries that have oil. Then he said he’s waiting to hear we are at war with Canada. We knock at their door and say, We‘re out of wood. @realDonaldTrump at “war” with Canada. Crazy!
3981 2018-09-02 22:22:11 Fair enough provided you can show the worldwide carbon reduction numbers if restrictions are invoked. Also show the reduction of worlds fossil fuel use with a restriction. If oil isn't bought here, it will be bought elsewhere.
3982 2018-09-02 22:21:55 That oil tho go dry 1 carton of chicken
3983 2018-09-02 22:21:49 I tried to be all mechanical today and check the oil in my car and it only took me like 10 mins to just open the stupid hood
3984 2018-09-02 22:21:35 Baby oil would smell better but on a science level that makes alot of sense
3985 2018-09-02 22:21:31 It depends on the quality of the CBD oil. It took me a week to find the right amt for me. The full effect was 30 days. I realized my body was quite. The background pain was gone. It comes back when I do a lot physical labor. It helps with muscle spasms.
3986 2018-09-02 22:21:25 Had made Calendula infused oil.

カレンデュラインフューズドオイル。

カレンデュラのオイルは炎症などにもってこい。
カレンデュラのイエローがでますね。

これからの手足のひび割れや唇などにリップやバームを作るのも良いですね。

もちろん子供や老人のあせもなどに
3987 2018-09-02 22:21:17 It seems 2 and 3 have also been paid, not only by Canadian gov but by some large foreign oil companies (Rosneft was documented), and a case of Rockefeller Foundation financing some aboriginal groups in Western Canada when they were  protesting.
3988 2018-09-02 22:21:16 Turn the taps off. Make 'em see the error of their ways. Then with SK & NL create an Oil Producing Provs Marketing Board. You guys buy all oil produced in Canada. Sell to favored partners at normal price. Non favored ? What ever is left 50 % + surtax. #therestisjustposturing
3989 2018-09-02 22:21:12 Why does it smell like snake oil?
3990 2018-09-02 22:21:02 Too bad @JustinTrudeau has no interest and passion for Canada's western provinces' energy issues as he does for eastern dairy farmers, the auto industry and his progressive activist agenda. Alberta with floods,fire,sinking economy, and no pipes out for oil. Just like his dad PET.
3991 2018-09-02 22:20:44 Excerpts from your own link posted here:
"Nigeria is ONE OF SUB SAHARAN AFRICA’S LARGEST ECONOMIES and relies heavily on oil as its main source of foreign exchange earnings and government revenues.."
I choose not to analyse further.

You can do better in this propaganda job pls.
3992 2018-09-02 22:20:44 Great then no one needs to drill for oil in the Arctic!
3993 2018-09-02 22:20:37 "Do you remember once when your "change oil" light came on? You just abandoned your car in a parking garage."
3994 2018-09-02 22:20:30 But how great would it have been to see Zack save that duck from the oil on the football field that day?
3995 2018-09-02 22:20:25 Almost any mechanic shop will do an oil change
3996 2018-09-02 22:19:48 I did some investigating. The robot/dolls are made of an extremely soft plastic which stains easily bcz of a high oil content in the plastic. The fingers have wire in them. If the wire is bent back and forth it will eventually break. Made in China from cheap materials.
3997 2018-09-02 22:19:45 In the 70's and 80's baby oil was favored for faster tanning results. Certain oils heat differently. That's the only thing I can think of for an olive oil preference.
3998 2018-09-02 22:19:21 Your skin is different from others, your acne can be triggered by pollution, hormones, stress; etc. Your pillow can also play a role. Look into silk pillows that balance the oil and pH in your skin, change them every two to three days and your sheets.
3999 2018-09-02 22:19:17 Gaskiya ne
4000 2018-09-02 22:19:17 I did not vote for our current president. Lol. He has loosened restrictions on offshore drilling, coal mines, gas and oil drilling in Alaska and many more things that will prove to hasten global warming. We need to promote clean energy. I’ll vote for change in next election!
4001 2018-09-02 22:19:15 Yeah soon it's gonna be asking you for oil supplements from Anemone.
4002 2018-09-02 22:19:11 During my internship at Murphy Oil Corporation last summer, I tested cryogenics
4003 2018-09-02 22:19:04 And the fatal flaw in the "originalist" doctrine is that their own interpretations of the founders' intent are biased by their conservative political beliefs, just as they accuse "activist" judges of being biased by liberal political beliefs. The right sells snake oil to suckers.
4004 2018-09-02 22:18:59 Why then are we not speedily building refineries here and getting off oil imports? Lobby for refineries not export pipelines!

4009 2018-09-02 22:18:25 Oh, that gave me a migraine just looking at that tweet. Wonder if it had been all his family slaughtered in Fallijah, if he would still consider it a net positive(because WE GOT THE OIL!)
4010 2018-09-02 22:18:14 Where can I find 10W-60 oil???
4011 2018-09-02 22:18:12 Lmao even put ami.

4013 2018-09-02 22:17:25 Olive Oil?
4014 2018-09-02 22:17:01 Oh, and soak the grill in pure simple green overnight to strip the paint off if it isn't oil base.  Scrub with a stiff Nylon brush and then it is ready for primer and paint.
4015 2018-09-02 22:16:59 try on tomato quarters, with olive oil
4016 2018-09-02 22:16:49 The replies from LRT had ppl suggesting West Canada should separate, all bc of pesky rule of law going against the corrupt project. Sensitive much? Join the collapsing US then, oil cultists
4017 2018-09-02 22:16:40 oil is at its peak.. time to add value to their currency..be the richest country on earth with the about of oil they possess.
4018 2018-09-02 22:16:28 In Canada white man thinks their tax dollars fund Native Canadians to the tune of 5.7 billion a year. WRONG the Canadian Government takes in 35 billion from native lands from lumber oil and mining . Of that 35 billion they give back 5.7 billion for 600 reserves.Canada gets 29.3b
4019 2018-09-02 22:16:24 If Boris - buy my snake oil - Johnson becomes our ‘leader’ then join me in slow-clapping us under the waves where we belong.
4020 2018-09-02 22:16:24 what kind of oil? that sounds so calming!
4021 2018-09-02 22:16:22 cbd topical oil?
4022 2018-09-02 22:16:05 But without all the Oil revenue how will you feed the Indians & refugees. How does Canada replace the revenue?
4023 2018-09-02 22:15:59 No money there just oil that they can’t get out of the ground.
4024 2018-09-02 22:15:49 How do you feel about oil from a sloppy pipeline ? #cdnpoli
4025 2018-09-02 22:15:35 I've been driving a 2004 red Ford focus, no a/c, leaks oil, you have to roll down the windows manually, probably shouldn't drive it over 60 mph... all it's missing is Chihuahua plates...
4026 2018-09-02 22:15:13 My review of #JackRyan episode 1 so far... 
Jack Ryan: I enjoy boats, bikes and food in tubs. Nine Eleven.
New boss: Grrr I am mad.
Jack Ryan: Nine. Eleven.
A sinister ginger man in Yemen does..something? Did he pee in the olive oil?
Jack Ryan: NINE. ELEVEN.
4027 2018-09-02 22:15:03 All of a sudden we are now staring at an astounding possibility that we can meaningfully change our society’s environmental impact. Isn’t it? Every car co. and their granny is going for EVs now. Imagine the impact on the old order - oil and power companies, Won’t end well - true.
4028 2018-09-02 22:14:59 (smirks a little and takes the bowl of the cut up veggies and puts them in the skillet with olive oil) Got any seasoning?
4029 2018-09-02 22:14:40 Research on CHS shows THC or CBD aren’t the cause. Mold, powdery mildew, pesticides like neem oil, chemical contaminants and poor gut health are the root problem in these cases. Most concentrates aren’t a healthy choice. Organic flower is the way to go when enjoying cannabis.
4030 2018-09-02 22:14:36 Did you have a sex change? They did a good job on your chest.use  vitamin E NOT mixed with soy. Also coconut oil is good. Put on especially when you sleep and cover with gauze so the oil stays
4031 2018-09-02 22:14:27 It can of course depend. Saturated fat, as essential as it is, can come from coconut oil, but Too much lauric acid can be a problem. Some people can make DHA & EPA with ALA, but not everyone. Amino acid balance is also hard to ensure depending on the person.
4032 2018-09-02 22:14:14 We will never build a wind turbine or an oil well that cannot potentially catch fire. What percentage of turbines catch fire? Powerlines kill  orders of magnitude more birds that wind turbines. Cat even way more than powerlines.

4034 2018-09-02 22:13:58 It's because they're not peace-loving socialist hippies. Twitter Facebook and YouTube need to silence the peace-loving hippies. More propaganda for murder for oil and money, less facts and peace. That's the goal. They're literally doing it right now

4036 2018-09-02 22:13:32 What a joke!  The insanity never ends!  Obama

in the same sentence.  It’s like vinegar and oil,
they don’t mix.
4037 2018-09-02 22:13:24 Oil areas, fracking, San Juan Basin--oil is way up over last cple years.
4038 2018-09-02 22:13:23 They use it to mimic suntan oil, which attracts the heat and helps with tans. It’s basically cooking you... terrible for skin
4039 2018-09-02 22:13:22 Because she wants the veto sign on her arm to be like a tattoo so she put the olive oil on it so it’ll resemble it when it dries over.
4040 2018-09-02 22:13:10 “Delighted” by genocidal monsters coating the earth in blood to make his loser friends a few bucks on fluctuating oil prices.
4041 2018-09-02 22:13:01 Pwahaha. CNN/FOX/NBC etc. Its corporate news. Same corporations own the same news. Thisbis why you dont see oil spills or #BigParma deaths.

4044 2018-09-02 22:12:26 OK there's a house on the north side of Cameron where some experiments with Swedish linseed oil paint are underway, that's us. Sometimes portaging  a canoe to the river
4045 2018-09-02 22:12:25 So what? Natural gas is needed by us common folk. It is cleaner than oil. What is the problem. Honestly, I don’t think socialists will be happy until each of us either starves or freezes to death.

4047 2018-09-02 22:12:10 Foraging animals require no fossel fuel, be they wild or domistic.
The fertilizer for plant based food is oil based.
Planting, and harvesting requires huge amounts of fuel, and large machines.
Processing plant based foods requires multimillion dollor factories.
4048 2018-09-02 22:11:55 Aye Memphis Twitter, I didn’t know the CBD oil was legal. They was selling it at the fair yesterday.
4049 2018-09-02 22:11:53 Time to light my oil. 
4050 2018-09-02 22:11:42 We need to increase taxes on the rich, free college, free medical care to all, increase regulations on corporations, restrict USA oil and gas exports, return to NAFTA pre 2016, open our borders, eliminate ICE, allow all illegals the same rights as citizens, hire more Leftists?LoL
4051 2018-09-02 22:11:15 The fire can't burn where there is no oil #anointing
4052 2018-09-02 22:11:13 *changes your oil while you dance on my lawn*
4053 2018-09-02 22:11:03 Sana oil nagsususpend
4054 2018-09-02 22:10:55 Because Africa has oil... and other glittery things.
4055 2018-09-02 22:10:53 Seems to me Con gov’t wins either way. But win bigger by keeping oil landlocked. It then all goes south. And who would personally benefit if that were to happen? Answer that question.
4056 2018-09-02 22:10:45 I could never. I tried pouring oil on her floor, dancing on her tables, and even lighting various items on fire. She’s just too dope for me.
4057 2018-09-02 22:10:38 Sorry, there’s no such thing as “Canadian oil” or “our oil”. Canadians have zero public ownership of “our product”. Oil in Canada is owned by oil companies unlike in Norway for example where the Norwegian public actually own their oil.
4058 2018-09-02 22:10:26 1) 92 Mercedes E300 wagon, 180k, exhaust and tranny were shot
2) 92 Camaro, my wife's, she drove it until it was unrepairable at 100k, killed by rusting brake lines at age 15
3) 71 Ford Maverick, 115k, rusted to death 
4  65 Buick Electra 105k main bearings froze (oil issue)
4059 2018-09-02 22:10:24 I'll send pics later of the fish and chips and other creations as they are prepped, the grocery store will feel different everything can be fried now without 400lbs of oil, less working out! I might even fry some chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream and some dough boy rolls!!!!!

4063 2018-09-02 22:09:56 No. It wasn't our money. The money was actually Iran's money for the purchase of their oil but was frozen when sanctions were levied against them in 1978.
4064 2018-09-02 22:09:48 CBD oil users who say it helps relieve pain, anxiety frustrated to learn product is illegal in Ohio: DA REPUBLICUNT DRUGGER CORP "KOCH"-SUKKAS HARD AT WORK TRYIN' TO JUSTIFY THEIR PHUK'N CORRUPTION AND GREED !!!
4065 2018-09-02 22:09:41 So true.  No centrist here, but I will say that I’m looking forward to the day where I can peacefully walk into a store in MN and buy some oil cartridges for my vape pen and live in the woods . Maybe not have to worry about being bankrupt over a medical issue too!  The dream.
4066 2018-09-02 22:09:40 Junior is putting PET to shame as far as treating the west like crap. NEB hurt the west oil industry, JT is trying to kill it. Very insulting to our western Canadian brothers and sisters, and JT cares less.
4067 2018-09-02 22:09:23 Mike's been known to fly off to some exotic places so ship him and his gang of buffoons to Nigeria where they can continue their anti oil protest.
4068 2018-09-02 22:09:09 Oh honey I'm so sorry! Do you have access to CBD oil?
4069 2018-09-02 22:09:09 I now order truffle oil fries whenever possible- when did I become so bougee? promise i am not a tory x
4070 2018-09-02 22:08:42 Hahahaha zeytoon ka oil
4071 2018-09-02 22:08:30 And I also see that my oil is leaking because I need a new oil pan gasket
4072 2018-09-02 22:08:04 I was starting to get overwhelmed by the essay I’m writing and I started to breathe heavier and my roommate immediately whipped out her lavender oil (,: what did I do to deserve her
4073 2018-09-02 22:08:04 @LBC @TomSwarbrick1 o please just let the party die! It's so corrupted by anti-Semitism, Marxism, socialists & terrorist sympathisers.

It's bad enough that their leader is a shady snake oil salesman who is backed up by a leftist progressive cult.

Labour is dead. Accept it.
4074 2018-09-02 22:08:01 Another ignorant Green who knows nothing about the Oil industry in Canada.....go get a job, add value. Holding an activist sign just won’t cut it Mark!
4075 2018-09-02 22:08:00 I bought cbd oil for my juul and the girl was super cute and gave me a free one too but for a pen but I don’t have a pen so now I have to buy a pen 
4076 2018-09-02 22:07:50 Yep. Islam is truly moronic, but then again, violence, intimidation and oil money help its rotten cause...  #CartoonContest #cartoons #cartoon #MuhammadCartoonContest
4077 2018-09-02 22:07:46 “how’s your skin so soft?” 

baby oil.
4078 2018-09-02 22:07:39 Thank you ladies you just saved me a ton of money. Is Castor oil okay? Since I already have some.
4079 2018-09-02 22:07:38 Maybe she _likes_ sloppy chips, rancid oil and that awful low sodium salt with all the potassium in it?
4080 2018-09-02 22:07:22 VRはた細ください！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！
4081 2018-09-02 22:07:02 I make a savoury tart with flaky puff pastry, goats cheese, caramelised onion, kale, mushrooms, truffle oil + lots of herbs and a pistachio, cranberry + quinoa nut roast smothered in gravy + all the usual sides.
4082 2018-09-02 22:06:57 Interesting! I guess I have to accept xir argument.
Oh: the Western world is juuust going to need back all those computers, vehicles, airplanes, asphalt, concrete, steel rebar, fridges, mobiles, oil tankers, ovens and food shipments. Cultural appropriation; y'know. Sucks, right?
4083 2018-09-02 22:06:31 The TV just told me to "substitute olive oil for dairy" and honestly this cereal tastes like shit
4084 2018-09-02 22:06:29 Ridiculous things you've said:
-you'll get an easy supply of oil
-America will invade Canada
-nothing good has come from Canada
-Canada is a failure
....etc
4085 2018-09-02 22:06:06 What material did you use for this? Oil paint, pastel, water colour? It's amazing
4086 2018-09-02 22:06:03 My father died at age 40 in 1975 from working in an unregulated oil refinery. The fact that your parents are still alive you can thank the big government for.
4087 2018-09-02 22:05:50 2/ One or possibly two to so-called tidewater would be beneficial in getting AB oil out of the oversupplied NA market. These big projects are never a slam-dunk, even as the US demonstrates. There were delays in the US for Enbridge's Line 3 expansion and KXL is still hung up.
4088 2018-09-02 22:05:24 Thank you for burning the midnight fantasy oil. I’m 9th pick 14 Team ppr 1QB, 2WR,1 RB, TE , 2 flex , def , kicker. Do I draft WR or RB first? RB or WR heavy? #Gratitude #yahoo #FantasyFootball
4089 2018-09-02 22:05:09 I wouldn’t dare take castor oil . I’d wait 2 more weeks before I’d do that lol
4090 2018-09-02 22:05:00 Everyone in this thread smoking brown oil
4091 2018-09-02 22:04:41 Because I have never used or needed suntan lotion

Explain to me why do they use olive oil??
#BB20
4092 2018-09-02 22:04:35 And easy access to Canadian oil for US. At a deflated price as well. 

There’s more to the story than sloppy policy design. Saudi Arabia starting a diplomatic mess comes to mind. 

How many of the antipipeline and anti Lib/NDP rhetoric is domestically generated?
4093 2018-09-02 22:04:17 Yeeeeeeees !!!! Get that vote done and dusted sharpish ! Have your oil all to yourselves and we won’t send anymore money from down here. Oh and we will take all the civil service jobs down to here as well. Enjoy !
4094 2018-09-02 22:04:03 It is saddening to hear so many issues going on with the oil & gas industry. They, to the person on the back of the Clapham Omnibus, appear to borrow from each other to bail or justify an action. Cuadrill are no different it seems. They seem to have spent a fortune #NotTheirMoney
4095 2018-09-02 22:04:02 Ain't u spossed to be selling some snake oil back rub or someshit
4096 2018-09-02 22:03:59 These instant hot-and-sour broad noodles flavored with hot oil and sesame seeds and Szechuan peppers (Sichuan Baijia brand) would have been much more pleasant to swallow than to inhale.
4097 2018-09-02 22:03:58 Yes because the oil in Venezuela is cleaner and more environmentally friendly right?
4098 2018-09-02 22:03:58 You've changed your name more times than you've changed the oil on your bike so please be quiet
4099 2018-09-02 22:03:41 Put castor oil on them at night it helps grow them out faster
4100 2018-09-02 22:03:32 I just got oil on my shirt...fun
4101 2018-09-02 22:03:28 Can't wait for opening day ! Me and the wife will be at Lucas Oil stadium.... Go Colts!
4102 2018-09-02 22:03:28 I used to have #argan oil from #Morocco , Shea butter from #Africa and coconut  oil from #India in my face and hair care routine. Yesterday  I bought an aloe Vera plant and started using its leaves content as masks  . #Nature
4103 2018-09-02 22:03:28 Just use coconut oil. Literally you can get a tub for cheap from the supermarket and it’s handy af for everything
4104 2018-09-02 22:03:16 Oil worker pay in the 6 figures
4105 2018-09-02 22:03:13 Keep the oil out and I’m sure you’ll catch Leonardo and diago
4106 2018-09-02 22:03:11  DOGE OIL SAQUE 1  GANHE 5 DOGES POR DIA  25% A 300% AO DIA POR 4 OU 6 DIAS  MÍNIMO 300 DOGES:
4107 2018-09-02 22:03:08 The sudden drop in investment in 2014 almost certainly corresponds to (and was caused by) the drop in oil prices.
4108 2018-09-02 22:03:08 What are you gonna do with it? Oil? Little bags of seeds?
4109 2018-09-02 22:03:01 That’s what democracy is. If facts change people change their mind. All the cheating, betrayal and false promises have come to the surface like oil on water and as a democracy we must vote again, what’s the problem you’re worried you will lose?
4110 2018-09-02 22:03:00 정말 내가 마비를 하는건지 마비가 나를 하는건지 알 수 없는 수준까지 이르니까 위험을 감지한..마비로 이뤄진 진유님 다메욧..눈을 떠서 현실을 챙겨
4111 2018-09-02 22:02:46 Blown away first day, think of fish sticks, egg rolls all nasty in oven and microwave no more drying out and fried without oil on outside, the frozen fries amazing!
4112 2018-09-02 22:02:46 My #SundayFunday so far has included replacing the liftgate seal and changing to oil and filter on my wife's Jeep.  Next I snaked a slow drain in the master bath. Then I adjusted the garage door opener for the elderly widow across the street. I just ooze hypermasculinity I guess.
4113 2018-09-02 22:02:43 Possibly but unlikely. Oil is black gold. What is more at risk is the social harmony of Germany, the nation now houses nearly 10% of the world’s gypsy and Muslim population while the locals are abusing the welfare system.
4114 2018-09-02 22:02:33 yea rubbing magnesium oil on bottom of feet or butt before bed (because that’s where it’s easily absorbed to the blood streams) helps relax muscles/muscle contractions/spasms that come from anxiety
4115 2018-09-02 22:02:31 I'd say chop him up...  Into oil barrels...  Fill 'em with concrete...
4116 2018-09-02 22:02:02 San Jose’s @TeamScrappers are the top qualifiers at the @NHRA #USNats! First career top qual!!

But he dropped oil and lost 15 points and thus got knocker out of the top 10…for now. Ignore it. You got this guys.
4117 2018-09-02 22:01:58 Ask me how you can get the Replenish Masque or Rejuveniqe oil for free, before the offer ends tonight!! 
4118 2018-09-02 22:01:54 As an atheist ,I still think Harris is selling more snake oil than JBP.
4119 2018-09-02 22:01:52 I had an oil leak recently that I thought might be a $900 fix, transmission pull.

Dealer found it was TWO leaks.

Both pretty easy.  $200 and done in an hour.

Try to hope for the best, lots of easy stuff can break, particularly with that big a leak.  Maybe a simple connection.
4120 2018-09-02 22:01:51 Yes from drilling in Arctic refuge to mining in protected lands like Utah to opening up huge swathes of Gulf Waters to Big Oil to giving billions in subsidies to King coal

4125 2018-09-02 22:01:22 Why they are taking blood  sample ..for what ...to see honey and olive oil in blood 
 Atleast ..first they shud  confirm what the bottles  contain .
4126 2018-09-02 22:01:16 Those Oil companies you mention have the highest safety and environmental standards in the world!! You and Lizzy keep drinking the kool - aid and live in debt you fools!
4127 2018-09-02 22:01:11 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.
4128 2018-09-02 22:01:06 what’s good

2. Canada’s competitors in international oil markets.
4138 2018-09-02 21:59:50 It’s so much hotter though.
4139 2018-09-02 21:59:44 Earlier Modiji was claimed to be Naseeb wala when price of crude oil was down but now crude oil increasing, so don't say that Modiji .........

4141 2018-09-02 21:59:33 Hobnobs are way to sweet and have gallons of palm oil. Hobnobs kill orangutans
4142 2018-09-02 21:59:30 Subsidies for the oil/gas industry exist, but they're given to distributors, refiners, importers, etc, not directly to customers the way EV credits are. Oil subsidies might keep gas prices low, but it's not quite the same as "we'll hand you $7,500 if you buy an EV"
4143 2018-09-02 21:59:20 Exxon and Shell basically stole oil and gas fields from gazprom in Ukraine. 
Don't for one minute think they'll not gonna want to fight for this.
4144 2018-09-02 21:59:12 Before oil was discovered, people were surviving in their corners of this vast land on what God has blessed them with. Oil made them lazy. The same oil money that hardly reaches the poor. The north will never advance if it continues to depend on other parts.
4145 2018-09-02 21:58:59 Our stainless steel #nameplates are durable enough to withstand the harsh environments of the oil and gas industry.
4146 2018-09-02 21:58:49 To whom is it less central to? Certainly not the comfortable urbanite who despite their disdain for oil owe their very existance to it. And will for quite some time.
4147 2018-09-02 21:58:47 It was nice doing some #Pilates this evening and finishing off with #Yoga.

Seagulls: Sort of a shitty bike, that needs oil, slowly coming to a stop song. 

God: Perfect.
4151 2018-09-02 21:57:55 You just need to keep rinsing it until the starch is out and the water is clear. Akho need ye oil.

4153 2018-09-02 21:57:44 Is there shale oil in that bit of Texas or something?
4154 2018-09-02 21:57:36 You’ve just shifted oil production to another area of the world, that’s all you’ve done here. More US tankers in the waters you claim to be protecting from a phantom oil spill. You’ve done nothing in terms of protecting that area.
4155 2018-09-02 21:57:20 Those who are AGAINST Anointing Oil , are just as worse than Demons.

Demons know the Christ and they confess "Penuel, Lesego Daniel we Know.... Who are you"

The Christ Never feels pain, that's why we Endure when our backs are being opened from Fresh wounds.
4156 2018-09-02 21:57:18 Never let a chain do brakes or oil. I had bad experiences with both. Unless its drum brakes, I hate drum brakes.

4158 2018-09-02 21:57:06 So you believe WCS and Dilbit are the same product as WTI or Brent and it should fetch the same price on the marker? If there is better price why doesn't the oil going through the existing TransMoutain get a better price?
4159 2018-09-02 21:56:56 blackheads don’t go away on their own....if u don’t get them while they’re small dirt, oil & bacteria will just keep continuing to clog that one pore causing the blackhead to get bigger along with the pore itself.
4160 2018-09-02 21:56:51 Attn: The Trump administration cleared the Dakota Access oil pipeline on Friday, saying that further environmental review didn’t bring up any new concerns. Even after it had five spills in its first six months of operation.
4161 2018-09-02 21:56:45 Yes, but not really in the USA. Whenever you look deeper at a list of oil company "subsidies" in the US, you see that most of it is things like LIFO accounting and accelerated investment depreciation, tax rules that apply to everyone and no one reasonable considers a subsidy
4162 2018-09-02 21:56:28 THROW TEA TREE OIL OR ICE ON YOUR FAVE
4163 2018-09-02 21:56:20 The peak oil folks were discussing this a decade ago. Viable oil reserves are a moving target, largely depending on price point and energy return on investment. If it takes a barrel of oil to extract a barrel of oil, it's a bust.

4172 2018-09-02 21:54:33 It’s so nice having a higher car so I don’t have to put it on ramps to change the oil
4173 2018-09-02 21:54:24 I use coconut oil. It eats through latex tho so be careful.
4174 2018-09-02 21:54:17 It’s natural to be anxious though. My family kept telling me to take castor oil, I did and I regretted it because it made my contractions worse when they finally came.
4175 2018-09-02 21:54:13 Gee Stuart, I though one of your big arguments was how Canada needs to import less "unethical oil". How do we do that without domestic refineries? How does exporting bitumen via pipeline and tanker make us energy independent? #cdnpoli
4176 2018-09-02 21:53:49 Coconut oil is poison for CONola and safola. Kills their sales.
4177 2018-09-02 21:53:37 Ha! Hilary and decent go together like oil and fire!
4178 2018-09-02 21:53:37 Nope they went to venezuela because their crude is easier to refine and you are terribly misinformed and very much full of shit. You are a paid spokesperson for big oil and biased as hell. If your info is so well researched and valid lets see some sources. Lets see some proof
4179 2018-09-02 21:53:30 The race wagon is getting new oil tomorrow morning and of course I got some nice Rowe 5W40 RSi for it 

Sadly I‘m not allowed to do it myself 
4180 2018-09-02 21:53:27 Just like when people didn't want to buy from Standard Oil, it was a snap to start an oil (exploration, extraction, transportation, refining, & direct supply) company right. Oh no, monopolies can engage in predatory pricing & origination tactics.I mean that never happened before.
4181 2018-09-02 21:53:20 What if it's engine oil that runs in their veins 
4182 2018-09-02 21:53:19 I have so many skincare products I forget the great ones. Tonight I started using my Daniele De Winter facial oil again and it was like having an aromatherapy facial. My skin feels amazing x x
4183 2018-09-02 21:53:11 Save your money. You will need it to clean up the mess the oil companies have left behind. You have borrowed on your future and will have to pay the price sooner or later. (Or your kids and grandkids will)
4184 2018-09-02 21:53:09 뭔가 어른버전 옷으로는 검은색 배치로 염색하면 될 것 같은데 나는 아직 뉴비 인데 이런 고민 해봤자고

4186 2018-09-02 21:52:46 People keep telling me that putting mayonnaise in a cake is just like adding eggs and oil. I have an entire continents worth of doubt. But I’m going to try it in a mug cake, wish me luck.
4187 2018-09-02 21:52:43 Reno with his half truths. All imported sugar had been banned in 9ja for years to boost local products like Dangote, Dogan's, Mc.

After that I use MAD blueberry extract brightening serum for my under eye & laugh lines

4201 2018-09-02 21:49:37 Also might add that @kenthehr office at Place 9-6 took down the yellow “PIPELINES UNDER CONSTRUCTION” sign on Friday morning. 

That sign bothered me on the way to work where as an oil patch accountant that has to live with WCS discount on daily basis.

4205 2018-09-02 21:48:52 Harmful?  Like regulations that allow pollution that sickens thousands of children & elderly?  Regulations like making sure the pipes carrying crude oil won't contaminate our water? Or the pesky regulations that protect endangered species?  THOSE regulations?
4206 2018-09-02 21:48:06 Liza Phase 1, is expected to begin producing oil by early 2020, and should churn out 120,000 barrels of oil a day. Construction of that first floating production vessel is already underway. The Hammerhead-1 is the ninth discovery offshore of Guyana made within st three years.#XOM
4207 2018-09-02 21:47:50 Exactly!! Whose paying my monthly pharmaceutical costs for my multiple daily medications that I must take for life to stay alive, definitely not the oil or fracking industry. I don't care how many billions the fracking industry contributes to the economy.

It’s called Commifornia for a reason.
4213 2018-09-02 21:46:58 For the pasta it’s easy just boil the pasta and in a separate pan melt butter and add minced garlic and parsley. Add in the pasta and before u mix it together with the garlic add a lil bit of olive oil and BOOM!

4217 2018-09-02 21:46:15 That's not pushing the boundaries. Suing cabal member Gov. Butch Otter in federal court 3 times is. The last one was for our Faith to use cannabis in the Holy oil. It is a requirement of our faith to make the Holy oil and give it to the sick as Jesus did. No man shall stop us.

4223 2018-09-02 21:45:30 We saw some quorn cocktail sausages reduced to 44p in tesco and made a lovely roast today - sausages, aubergine, tomatoes, onion and garlic roasted in plenty oil and a splash of balsamic for an hour or so... recommend!
4224 2018-09-02 21:45:28 Just imagine a situation where PMB had used  the money he used in search of oil in sokoto to do irrigation in say zamfara. Don't you think there'd be grass for cattle to graze on? Middle belt would be safer too

4226 2018-09-02 21:44:56 Regardless, next time I make roast potatoes I am going to roast them in red wine instead of oil or fat. For science.
4227 2018-09-02 21:44:56 Pension funds investing into hedge funds that invest into shale oil companies that are all losing money. What could go wrong..
4228 2018-09-02 21:44:48 California is currently what, 5th largest economy in the world? In tens years Venezuela went from a wealthy oil country to a shithole. How long will California last once they get the socialist anti-business economy they are moving towards?

4234 2018-09-02 21:44:03 Trudeau's purchase of an oil pipeline for 11 billion dollars has produced the immediate loss of 8000 jobs.  Feel bad for you.
4235 2018-09-02 21:43:55 Line 9 is a high pressure oil line. The spills response is from Westover Ontario over 40 minute drive away. The volumes spilled from a pin prick sized hole would be a disaster much much  larger than the spill I filmed in that video.
4236 2018-09-02 21:43:38 There’s an oil boom in Midland right now.
4237 2018-09-02 21:43:37 I once worked for a highly well known burger chain (not going to drag them because I don’t want to ruin people’s opinions of the company.) I was underpaid by at least five dollars, and I used to get injuries at work. Oil burns, I had a vent grate fall on me once, and more.

4261 2018-09-02 21:40:09 That's the "England" that has been brainwashed for centuries to regard Scotland as a subsidy-junky liability. The people actually in charge of Brexit know differently though, and will fight to retain the oil, whisky, renewables, water etc. etc.

4265 2018-09-02 21:39:41 Counting of the resource value is financialization of the oil industry.
4266 2018-09-02 21:39:27 Ask yourself want Nation has the smallest population and the largest natural resources. Oil, silver, copper, titanium, gold, could go on and on. What nations have no Rothschilds banks. Not China or Russia or seven of the Middle East Nations that are now destroyed.

4271 2018-09-02 21:38:56 Just an odd thought... for costumes in general, an awkward dilemma with no winning answers.

Fursuits: synthetic material is made from oil mostly, real fur can squick people out, or pose other moral issues. 

Latex: blood of tortured trees. At least nothing died?

4273 2018-09-02 21:38:47 Seems an alignment of power states (incl oil $) on a basis of "might makes right" and "right now," in disregard of (1) future consequences and (2) equity rights: in this, would undermine the two basic principles of political order - long-range governance and inclusion.
4274 2018-09-02 21:38:23 Yes! One of the Primary Christian Faith was just jailed for the herb. The tenants of our faith are that we are to make the Holy oil and give it to the sick as Jesus did. Cannabis bud is 1 of the ingredients. This is in a federal action against Idaho for denying us CBD hemp oil.
4275 2018-09-02 21:38:08 I toss with salt, pepper and olive oil and put them right on the grill. A tiny squeeze of lemon juice when they come off.
4276 2018-09-02 21:37:43 No pipeline will be built because “ Honest Canadian Oil “ is not wanted by fallen angel of war, Israel Saudi Axis, the global ultra rich, secret societies. The issue needs prayer to Jesus in times of neo lib & secret  wars

4282 2018-09-02 21:37:03 The point is that we don't even have prototypes for many vehicles & therefore the transition to electric from internal combustion will take a long time. 

That means accepting that oil will be needed for years, if not a couple decades, which means ensuring we can meets FF needs.

4292 2018-09-02 21:35:38 Refined petroleum had a shelf life limiting the export market for it. Unrefined oil does not. We export oil for the same reason we export grain and not bread, it lasts longer and thus there are more buyers.
4293 2018-09-02 21:35:29 Olive oil. 10x's better than KY. Hands down,  er up.  And better for softer skin.
4294 2018-09-02 21:35:21 China's prime aim is to sink oil but if I'm right about US #OilStandard, they'll inadvertently get a double whammy as oil & dollar go down together. Then a less pleasant surprise as gold tanks as well #OOTT
4295 2018-09-02 21:35:18 Darren would you trade your life to be a fish or bird or even a human of 200 years ago with a life expectancy of 50?

4304 2018-09-02 21:33:05 You are really a joke.  Alberta is sitting on a pile of shitty oil and somehow you are pretending that Albertans are now the heroes.  Well it wasn't you, pal, that put that stuff there.  Someone found it, found a way of diluting and piping it.  Then Albertans blew all the money.
4305 2018-09-02 21:33:04 Hi Natasia. I believe every parable (this being the second in a row) is about apostasy. I think the fact they didn’t bring extra oil for their lamps suggests they believed He would arrive earlier in the night, or that it would pan out for them.

4313 2018-09-02 21:32:33 I have been under this truck all day. It has 4 new shocks now, the oil has been changed, the rear differential serviced, the timing reset and the carburetor adjusted. I am filthy, sore, and bleeding a little. Think I'll actually drive it for a bit.
4314 2018-09-02 21:32:14 No. Bought baby oil and sun in. Lol.
4315 2018-09-02 21:32:10 I can get pure thc oil or whatever it is called. But for me, without the anxiety meds, it can make my anxiety worse. So with my xanax, I will use pot also. Both together work great. Even tho legal, I have not told my Dr as she might think I have "progressed". lol into "stronger"

4333 2018-09-02 21:30:12 Well genius, why would the US care about Syrian oil then? Looks like Russia and Iran controls the Syrian oil. We don't need it, so why fight a war for it?
4334 2018-09-02 21:30:06 Exactly!  That oil probably made it's feathers better for the winter season

4336 2018-09-02 21:29:54 So Reggie likes to build through the draft and Jon likes older vets.
Oil & Vinegar?
4337 2018-09-02 21:29:36 The thing is the Dummiecrat machine will take both the votes living,dead,illegal,incarcerated.
That's the oil that keeps the machine moving

4339 2018-09-02 21:29:29 Unless you could in flight refuel but that's reserved for military applications.

Usually C-130.......KC-141 etc...

Rick Perry flew C-130s didn't he?  Interesting fellow--Air Force then Oil and Gas industry--hmm...
Off fit for a Pilot after uniform.

Trove of knowledge I bet
4340 2018-09-02 21:29:09 And oil demand over that same time period?  Up and to the right ...
4341 2018-09-02 21:28:49 That's a canard. Dollars are held by few nations as reserves for oil. Most oil is bought, especially by developing nations, by using $ denominated bank credit. Post 2008 most $ Multi-trillions was via Eurodollar loans since US banks were on life support
4342 2018-09-02 21:28:47 @jiffylube went to go change my oil today and saw that your people at the bonney lake, wa branch have completely stripped the oil pan plug bolt. Im going to have to take it in to get it removed professionally. Y'all charge over double what it should cost and them ruin my car.
4343 2018-09-02 21:28:44 If you keep it in for too long then yes. To keep it from getting tangled I spray it with water+leave in and an oil then fluff it out. This is not a long term bun it’s more like an emergency bun
4344 2018-09-02 21:28:40 Sugar beats are abundant in the prairies also.  Two massive sugar factories in southern Alberta.  Canada really doesn’t need sugar or wheat or oats or barley or oil or canola or potatoes or corn.  Canada is self sufficient.
4345 2018-09-02 21:28:37 No to benefit big oil and gas and coal
4346 2018-09-02 21:28:17 it’s crazy I used to go to the tanning bed constantly/sun bathe/wear tanning oil but now im so anti-tanning it’s nuts. sunscreen everyday. umbrella at the beach. am I getting wise or just old?
4347 2018-09-02 21:28:15 Ziyen Inc. currently has over 315 shareholders in the company and will have over $5 million in net tangible assets once the company moves into production, these are two of the key requirements to going public on the exchange.  #stockexchange #invest #investors #oil
4348 2018-09-02 21:28:09 DITTOS! Find a SLS free toothpaste!! Its been a complete game changer for me. the meantime, swish some coconut oil around in there.
4349 2018-09-02 21:28:07 “Invest the money...” You mean $4.5 Billion of our tax dollars that they already blew? There’s no getting that back to invest. And much less of where that came from too... now that they’ve succeeding in running the oil and pipeline companies out of canada.
4350 2018-09-02 21:27:58 a jar of coconut oil in the bedroom is a great thermostat if you don't have AC
4351 2018-09-02 21:27:28 China hates oil over $50..if your thesis is correct..they will sink the price of both ..as a means to an end
4352 2018-09-02 21:27:19 Sweden has the population of New Jersey and gets billions in North Sea Oil..   you're really misinformed.  Sweden has a capitalist market economy. Sweden is an export-oriented mixed economy featuring a modern distribution system, excellent internal & external communication
4353 2018-09-02 21:27:18 that’s the stuff you use to clean oil based paints
4354 2018-09-02 21:27:10 You mean the one who’s dipstick has checked the oil in every hooker or pro star he could pay for?
4355 2018-09-02 21:27:09 We are so excited to participate in our first food festival @eatrealfest September 14-16 in Jack London Square. We’ll be sharing samples of EXAU Olive Oil and teach you how to taste real EVOO. Bottles will be available for sale! See you there!  #erf2018 #EXAUoliveoil

4357 2018-09-02 21:26:50 You're an optimist, good for you. Me too, just not quite as much. Oil pumpers are very good at what they do. Waiting for them to lose profitability means waiting far too long. Thanks for the interest, but this has moved beyond useful discussion now. I'm muting the thread. Cheers!
4358 2018-09-02 21:26:49 I am not a fan of #juniorTrudeau, especially since he is still being #doubledumbtrickdumb with regards to oil pipelines, but at least he isn't #lepetitharper the little dictator that couldn't..
4359 2018-09-02 21:26:36 but it doesn't :/ they always fall off.

This time I tried the oil and water, getting the dough wet enough before putting the oats on, most of them stayed this time!

4368 2018-09-02 21:25:17 I prefer bossman chips though - there's soul in the oil!

4371 2018-09-02 21:24:43 That transition isn’t a reality. The bottom line is our economy and society depend on oil. The losses our country would endure with a cessation of oil production aren’t acceptable. A better idea would to work globally to help the largest polluters come closer to our standards
4372 2018-09-02 21:24:43 Why is oil slick, just are a bucket of fried butter shine such a trend in makeup

I remember when matte porcelain skin was the trend and I struggled to keep that, now you got people with face that looks like they took a butter stick and smeared it all over.
4373 2018-09-02 21:24:31 They don’t upgrade it here because the Harper government allowed the communist Chinese gov’t to own the oil sands. Hello people...it’s a Canadian resource but you allowed China to own it. All Canadians get is the opportunity to work for the state government of China.
4374 2018-09-02 21:24:21 It is! Tossed in olive oil and salt, then run through the broiler for 10 minutes!
4375 2018-09-02 21:24:19 Tuscaloosa Walmart is slow !!!! About changing oil lol
4376 2018-09-02 21:24:17 But the environmental risked just went through the roof. Pipelines are much safer than oil by rail.
4377 2018-09-02 21:24:16 Peppermint oil in a glass of water! (Just a tiny bit)  Works better than anything for me.  Learned about it from a nurse when my husband was doing chemo.  He swore by it too.
4378 2018-09-02 21:24:16 Re-oiled & filtered car but it is still making the whiny noise... at least the oil light has gone out & didn't trip the engine out... #carsarestupid
4379 2018-09-02 21:24:10 cbd oil is my new bestie
4380 2018-09-02 21:24:10  imma need me an oil man
4381 2018-09-02 21:24:04 I find that the evangelical oil salesmen, that claim Trump was sent from God to be President rather disturbing and distasteful.
4382 2018-09-02 21:24:04 Yes, there is advancing tech. Ask a researcher who works for any oil sands co. Private invest’t has funded extensive research into emissions, tailings, renewables, etc. for decades. Taxpayers can’t fund risky experiments while giving up oil revenues.
4383 2018-09-02 21:24:02 Holy shit these are like oil paintings 
4384 2018-09-02 21:23:48  to get rid of the excess oil, it’s worth it

4386 2018-09-02 21:23:38 They were an unknown last year, they won't be taking anyone by surprise in 2019....it will be a more difficult year for LVK....just ask the Oilers via 2018....that being said, I can't wait to go watch the Oil in Vegas.
4387 2018-09-02 21:23:29 ajax has more chance to win the champions league than oil city fc.
4388 2018-09-02 21:23:21 I think there would have some real advance research into our tenuous position,a humble understanding that Cdn oil no  longr packs the clout we had pre’14& Just watching Trump& jt interact, it’s very clear who is in charge. I feel for Canada but it voted for a child & got one.
4389 2018-09-02 21:23:18 I'd like to be at the policy committee meeting where staff tell policymakers who had previously agreed on PLT that because of the (say) oil price shock they had previously incurred, policy would have to tighten to bring the price level down even though the real economy is weak.
4390 2018-09-02 21:23:15 あいむじゃぱにーず←可愛い
4391 2018-09-02 21:23:09 I get Texans feeling about Lyin Ted considering what their biggest industry is. I mean he's so greasy and corrupt he leaves oil slicks everywhere he goes...
4392 2018-09-02 21:23:08 To be fair, it's the same on both sides ("shorts are paid by big oil, etc"). @TeslaOpinion 's posts - the same ones are duplicated over and over again across multiple threads - are strongly indicative of a spam account. Scroll through his "Tweets and Replies" for yourself.
4393 2018-09-02 21:22:41 Which oil you dey rub? Who dey lie give you
4394 2018-09-02 21:22:17 As oil carried on pushing diesel as clean, Tesla was an embryo, today they are a teen, but very soon they are going to come of age, and then... It's game on!

4397 2018-09-02 21:21:54 I remember trying to buy some specific shade of yellow oil paint at Blick for a class I was in at the time, and the lady who was helping me decided I was pronouncing the name wrong (I wasn’t) and corrected me with some really botched pronunciation lol
4398 2018-09-02 21:21:51 No guts no glory haha, just gotta used a good infused oil or flakes, powder would make it gritty #neindanke

4401 2018-09-02 21:21:39 Ain’t nothing better than rubbing your whole body down in cocoa butter oil after a shower . Be feeling and smelling good asf
4402 2018-09-02 21:21:27 He forgot Russians. An Indian medical professional informed me all my captured experiences was cataloging russian bots. Why russian bots? because Russia is threatened by elon musk who plans to destroy their oil industry. Surprised he didn't mention rocket engines too.
4403 2018-09-02 21:21:05 I use a little olive oil spray at home but, at the deli they load it with so much butter it gives me diarrhea every time
4404 2018-09-02 21:21:03 There is no such thing as responsible oil production when it contributes to climate change. We should set an example by doing everything we can to transition ASAP. If while doing that we produce oil as cleanly as possible, that’s good. Tar sands oil is some of the dirtiest tho.
4405 2018-09-02 21:20:58 Bro this car needs a Mandatory oil change. Fuck it’s Sunday
4406 2018-09-02 21:20:38 Good luck with that since tRump doesn’t support alternative energy sources and will continue to try to kill solar in favor of oil and coal.
4407 2018-09-02 21:20:35 My drunk tweets account for 100% of my unfollows.
4408 2018-09-02 21:20:28 All the leaders leaking oil down the stretch -6 and -7's may still have a chance. This has been a very ugly last hour or so of golf.
4409 2018-09-02 21:20:27 I was not trying to be disrespectful but I got into so much trouble because my health teacher asked what we were supposed to put on when we went out in the sun and I said “tanning oil!” INSTANT regret.
4410 2018-09-02 21:20:26 Yes, indeed. Or carrying-out an oil and filter change on the pickup truck - whether it needs it or not. All preferable to listening to BO...
4411 2018-09-02 21:19:52 ❤︎Once you come out of the shower gently pat your hair dry with a towel
❤︎When approx 80% of the water has gone apply hair cream/oil of your preference -I personally suggest raw coconut oil !
4412 2018-09-02 21:19:41 I read an article that said the Alberta oilsands held an estimated 1800 yr supply of oil. When will Canada finally take advantage of our opportunity to be a world leader in natural resources. Play our cards right and lets take full advantage. Make Canada great again.
4413 2018-09-02 21:19:41 Trump’s obsession with Iran, like the establishment’s generally goes back to Iran having the temerity to wantvto use their oil to develop their own nation instead of enrich British bankers
4414 2018-09-02 21:19:40 Lavender oil is my FAVORITE! I have a lavender and lemon balm mix for anxiety and it’s one of my favorites scent wise!

4424 2018-09-02 21:18:25 It's all about the oil. That's the only reason we went over there to begin with.
4425 2018-09-02 21:18:23 Man flu has hit me out of no where and the only thing we have in the house is Olbas oil that went out of date in 2013. Been inhaling it since 8pm and I’m not dead yet........
4426 2018-09-02 21:18:22 Nope! These are waste tankers, NOT oil tankers & it will be very unwise to buy #UKOG because of some twitter photos! IMHO, the Weald oil fiasco will make lots of pi lose money like Desire petroleum #DES remember? #ANGS Lidsey & Brockam are the proof that they r NOT commercial
4427 2018-09-02 21:18:22 Same way hitler and stahlin got support. Hes a snake oil salesman and says whatever they want to hear. He villifies those he wants to get rid of and appeals to the basest of our natures with fear and lies. If they were to see the truth theyd have to admit they were duped.
4428 2018-09-02 21:18:21 Thats outrageous wow im shocked! So glad i just use essential oil & a bit of Earth dishwashiing liquid to wipe my benches. Thanks for sharing. Humans what are we doing#AnimalRights
4429 2018-09-02 21:18:14 Is that so, you do know Norway produces twice as much oil at under half the cost as Scottish oil fields?

4435 2018-09-02 21:17:05 The anti-oil men are oil men, Texas doesn’t want Alberta competing oil in the gulf, Montreal Gang doesn’t want Alberta oil competing with their Saudi contracts, Irving doesn’t want Alberta oil up setting there deals with Middle East and Venezuela, bands want their cut, only China

4439 2018-09-02 21:16:28 The only Biden policy most dems don't endorse is the one where he touches women and children weirdly even while on camera. The rest of the pro war, pro bank, pro oil, pro pharma, pro lobbyist stuff they can get behind because he likes trains and has a charming smile
4440 2018-09-02 21:16:27 I wonder how much money the Trump administration spends on tanning oil and golf club memberships

4445 2018-09-02 21:16:05 I’m pretty sure you found one there. The US $’s invested in anti-Canadian Oil prioaganda was swallowed whole by GST. There is nothing like Canadians promoting the US oil market to make you want to throw up your Timmies!
4446 2018-09-02 21:15:53 @roseqvartz That face oil it's soothig and hydrating 
4447 2018-09-02 21:15:42 Petroleum has its uses, but as an energy source its days are numbered by math. Right now with the known & theoretical oil supply, if the use of oil is the same then we have 10 years maybe, if it keeps rising at the same rate less. All the major users are nuclear powers too.
4448 2018-09-02 21:15:28 Don't forget to always use essential oil before, during, and after sex!
4449 2018-09-02 21:15:23 Syria has pipelines running through the country, genius.  The oil doesn't necessarily come from Syria, but from other countries.  Whoever controls the pipelines controls the oil.
4450 2018-09-02 21:15:21 CRA records do show how many FN Chiefs who opposed the project did receive payment from the tides foundation. Most were paid around $50,000 to sell both their dignity and their own people out. Pretty cheap investment for those who want our oil to remain landlocked
4451 2018-09-02 21:15:21 A solder blob is shinier than a coffee or oil stain, but no less respectable.
4452 2018-09-02 21:15:20 Roll up and smoke the midnight oil.
4453 2018-09-02 21:15:07 and @narendramodi you can just complain???? LOL
BJP is a gandu party.
punish them if you have SPINE.
4454 2018-09-02 21:15:06 Pls could I get my midnight oil medium rare, do not burn.
4455 2018-09-02 21:15:00 Enjoy hun! I’m sure you already know this but I would suggest using a plain face oil underneath the foundation, regardless of whether you have oily or dry skin because it can be very hard to blend otherwise!
4456 2018-09-02 21:15:00 Got massage oil 
4457 2018-09-02 21:14:58 I’m really not some Dick Cheney eager to torture the browns and boost our GDP and get oil and excuse the laundry list of US crimes.

My motivation comes from a frustration for how much westerns don’t care about “others”. Foreign POC. I’m also staunchly pro-refugee and aid.
4458 2018-09-02 21:14:54 really?? mine is so creamy, also u can aply baby oil to it but the kvd one is so dry for me ..when i wanna apply more some of my brow hairs come off ): so 1/10 but tbh the outcome is nice !
4459 2018-09-02 21:14:49 USA cancels £300m aid to Pakistan due to 'Pakistan not doing enough to combat terrorism'. FALSE NEWS! Its because Imran Khan is on record saying he will tell USA to fuck off once he is in power. No more access to Pakistan's oil and resources Trump.
4460 2018-09-02 21:14:37 None of those. Just the oil
4461 2018-09-02 21:14:32 "Take their oil "....That is what Trump is thinking!
4462 2018-09-02 21:14:28 Yeah because that can go south so fast!!! Bed bugs are a huge epidemic these past two summers!! Oh btw the maggies farm stuff is really strong smelling. Kinda like tea tree oil. But yeah silicon will dry up any nasty you got!

4465 2018-09-02 21:13:53 How many of those oil wells do you have 300 feet or less outside your front door? You should try a frack gas well sometime, see how great you think it is then.
4466 2018-09-02 21:13:46 Protecting their stolen assets of #Genie Oil in the #GolanHeights no doubt.
4467 2018-09-02 21:13:41 barely managed to spread the last of my olive oil between two focaccia bread doughs...i could've bought more but i was just at the store for yeast and i don't want to look like a fool
4468 2018-09-02 21:13:36 Lol. So if people weren't around to burn wood and oil, there would not be enough CO2 for plants? CO2 in the atmosphere has increased 45% since the industrial revolution. Obviously we're outputting more than plants can absorb.
4469 2018-09-02 21:13:32 I use CBD oil to help with my anxiety. It's the best of has been in years.
4470 2018-09-02 21:13:30 HIT IT, HIT IT! So I'll oil you think of the circumstances, formal dress...
4471 2018-09-02 21:13:29 I say we take 10 dollars from them for every veteran they ever got killed and give it all to the family’s that lost a Father or a Mother Or Kid to the wars for oil and political gain
4472 2018-09-02 21:13:27 Neither of them are old enough to put AB anger into context. I lived through the 80s oil busts when Mort rates went up to 20%. Friends lost their homes. I renewed at 12%. What they are seeing is the chip on Conservative shoulders. They are adding to it with divisive comments.

4474 2018-09-02 21:13:18 Oil leak not good
4475 2018-09-02 21:12:56 .... as long as oil down and fish cake on your list you good yes lol
4476 2018-09-02 21:12:51 With Canada producing less than 1.5% of the worlds pollution we are hardly the ones to blame for the current mess. Why should we an energy rich nation depend on others for resources. We have the opportunity to set an example for responsible oil production and should do so.
4477 2018-09-02 21:12:31 #XOM Exxon Mobil Hammerhead-1 discovery in Guyana basin, hit oil at a well drilled nearly 14,000 feet at a deepwater depth of almost 3,400 feet. This represents 5 discoveries in Stabroek Block past year.

Exxon Mobil estimates it's discovered 4 billion barrels of recoverable oil
4478 2018-09-02 21:12:09 And my Twitter crashed in the last lap... No clue what happened now.  Lucas Oil Raceway needs Wi-Fi.
4479 2018-09-02 21:11:54 I was listening then read that Harper and Trudeau are financially invested in oil stocks ! Is this true and why not a conflict of interest?
4480 2018-09-02 21:11:44 I've seen many documented cases of leukemia being cured with cannabis oil x
4481 2018-09-02 21:11:42 Show me where the US has EVER imported oil from Syria?
4482 2018-09-02 21:11:23 I know for fleas we fumigated the house with cedar oil because something in it pretty much made them choke to death 
4483 2018-09-02 21:11:15 Why bother to interview him? Hes a shake oil salesman at best.
4484 2018-09-02 21:11:04 One day we’ll have to survive without oil. By your logic, we won’t.
4485 2018-09-02 21:10:35 Life in Uganda is much better than Kenya. It's a land locked country importing most of its goods through the  port of Mombasa. Sadly, those goods are cheaper in Uganda than In Kenya despite having been taxed heavily by Kenyan govt. Oil is a good example.
4486 2018-09-02 21:10:10 Y'all be out here smoking  oil

4496 2018-09-02 21:08:52 Gud night.But anointing oil and water is just a business -God is not involved. It's business translation between you and yo Papa.
4497 2018-09-02 21:08:46 CK-4といえば対(？)となるFA-4ですがHTHS粘度を2.9〜3.2と独自の上限値を定めた点は規格としては特殊かも。ACEA A5みたいに2.9〜3.5というのはありますが。

これは省燃費性を試験等ではなくHTHS粘度を下げる事で取り入れてるという直球仕様なので上限を決めるのは当然っちゃ当然なのですが
4498 2018-09-02 21:08:41 the tiny crispy edge on pancakes when u make them with coconut oil 
4499 2018-09-02 21:08:40 That would be the least they owe since they been stealing there oil since the 1st gulf war .look how rich dickhead Cheney, donscumbag Rumsfeld got off that war .they are all war criminals .
4500 2018-09-02 21:08:32 Five million barrels of kerosene, 5 million barrels of kerosene. To cite the comment about the car-chasing dog, once they got them what would they do with them?  But the mystic figure here is Russia, it's oil compsabny a Russian gal and her back-door Christian-fundamentalist goy.
4501 2018-09-02 21:08:32 Witness K is the whistleblower on Australia’s bugging of the East Timor Parliament & the efforts to screw them over the oil fields.

The Australian Government is *very* against whistleblowers, and allowing Chelsea Manning into the country would be against this philosophy.
4502 2018-09-02 21:08:15 War for profits! That is the real meaning of all war, profit, money, military contracts, oil, resources, control.
4503 2018-09-02 21:08:11 That kind extra bullet of a thing 
4504 2018-09-02 21:08:08 When you consider that a couple of U.$. billionaires are a major driving force behind the continued exploitation of the oil sands... #Kochbros

4506 2018-09-02 21:07:46 I mean, the only reason that Venezuela failed is because Chavez put all its economy in oil. It would be fine now if they had just diversified their economy.
4507 2018-09-02 21:07:31 If the media wasn’t covering those problems you’d never know about them. You’re a failed game show host, not a GOP insider. And someone should investigate your snake oil arthritis cure.
4508 2018-09-02 21:07:22 This is exactly what happens, socialism destroys families and countries. Venezuela rich with oil is poor like Cuba.
4509 2018-09-02 21:07:02 WANTED: Cartoonish 40+ man with shoulder length hair on Tinder who intro's himself with: "I have high standards." Works in antiques and sells cannabis oil. Goes by two names. Shoot on sight.
4510 2018-09-02 21:06:57 That would mean Trudeau and Butts would have to lead. Not likely given their views on oil.
4511 2018-09-02 21:06:49 Too much coconut oil so my straightened hair is a flop

4513 2018-09-02 21:06:25 Raiders prove me right

AFC is basically Patriots, some teams with a microscopic chance of beating them in the Playoffs before the Super Bowl and then teams who will rev up those tanks and hope to oil them well
4514 2018-09-02 21:06:21 I hope all the dark skin girls that got compared to pitch oil, toolum, dirt and chimpanzees only to be ironically referred to as "Chocolate Queens" circa 2017, had an amazing weekend 

And I hope all the people that bullied them step in something wet while wearing socks :)
4515 2018-09-02 21:06:16 idk who put these oil pastels in my art box but they were in there so i’m gonna use them lmaooo
4516 2018-09-02 21:05:59 I keep it super simple. Oven roasted tomato’s with an oil based sauce and once platted up place the burrata on top.

4519 2018-09-02 21:05:03 With some kind of oil. I like tea with coconut oil personally.
4520 2018-09-02 21:05:01 These oil balancing wipes and toner spray had better help my face cause i am done with having breakouts and dry skin 24/7
4521 2018-09-02 21:04:56 Oil companies can afford to pay for their own wall. Cut the CEO pay in half to pay for it.
4522 2018-09-02 21:04:54 @ArizonaGovernor did you know Ca. Dems. Outlawed oil in cal. As of 2042? Shocking, I know. Any McCain Sen. Would work w/Kamala Harris, to do the same nation wide because they hate Trump. Is that what you want? That is only 1 issue. Don't replace a McCain with a McCain. Be great.

4525 2018-09-02 21:04:37 Why would the time take effect the nature of the deal? If anything, oil prices gone up since then, so might be able to get a better deal...

4529 2018-09-02 21:03:57 Oil and water dont mix. Very similiar to 1.6 million influx of different culture into German culture. Impossible. Do you think this might have been planned done on purpose to cause what we are seeing unfold before our eyes.
4530 2018-09-02 21:03:55 See? They are everywhere. They want to braid it, and oil it, and put beads in it. So bothersome. MY EYES ARE UP HERE!!

4542 2018-09-02 21:01:59 The Gospel of water and Oil is purely Demonic. It has diluted the faith of many.
I said it.
#TruthSetsFree
4543 2018-09-02 21:01:51 We use it ALL THE TIME. Basically, if a recipe calls for olive oil and it’s not a dessert, it gets mojo. :D
4544 2018-09-02 21:01:46 And while I don't *quite* rule out Russia being foolish enough to take actions that would undermine the oil industry at some point, @algore clearly understands the economic consequences of the shift.

Would he have followed w/@aitruthfilm?

I'll consider anything.

W/evidence.
4545 2018-09-02 21:01:45 There are environmental risks whether oil moves by rail or by pipelines & tankers. The question is whether we want to export our  oil or not. Would keeping it all at home benefit our domestic gas prices & internal trucking costs? How might that impact the Canadian economy?
4546 2018-09-02 21:01:39 Shall I ?... any oil will do, or only coconut oil?

4549 2018-09-02 21:01:10 Syria has oil pipelines, so yes.
4550 2018-09-02 21:01:09 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, but they go out fast.

4552 2018-09-02 21:00:57 Wow, cool.
4553 2018-09-02 21:00:56 That’s clear. Here is what else is clear:

- no protest over the 100s of supertankers that go through Salish Sea to WA
- no protest over imports of oil from Saudi, Nigeria, Russia, Venezuela
- vast majority of ghg is from SE Asia and US. And u r fighting Canada

It’s very clear.

4558 2018-09-02 21:00:22 Hmm ...........jet fuel eh?  How ironic.  Experts put the Trade Towers collapse in the light of jet fuel burn to steel melting point in part due to non fire shielding insulation missing from the structure.

JP fuel is?  Oil and Gas would have that recipe.
4559 2018-09-02 21:00:15 September 02, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
4560 2018-09-02 21:00:12 Hmm. Either operating cash flow is down or Capex shot up, maybe oil cos?
4561 2018-09-02 21:00:11 "in the presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil."
4562 2018-09-02 21:00:10 In my experience Western Europe generally looks on the US for what it is: a violent military empire intent on dominating every country on Earth and we're just glad we don't have any oil reserves that would get us bombed into oblivion.

The shine it's given her coat is beautiful.  I let her lick a little...I'd read a tsp to tbls depending on weight, is beneficial.
4572 2018-09-02 20:58:46 I started putting coconut oil on my cuticles & nails, couldn’t believe how much they grew. You ever see those girls that have nails so long they curl? 
4573 2018-09-02 20:58:31 Let’s hope so. Currently, nothing comes close to oil’s energy output. It’s dirty but effective. Most people don’t realize how much their modern lifestyle is dependent on petroleum. Food production especially.
4574 2018-09-02 20:58:30 Oil dey your head
4575 2018-09-02 20:58:15 my car was struggling during a long drive today and at every stop i made to check the engine i was approached by at least one middleaged man. some of them followed my car flashing their lights til i pulled over. not one of them could offer more help than “did you check the oil”
4576 2018-09-02 20:58:01 I think we should make friends with Russia and take the oil that is ours we drilled the Wells and showed them how to refine it it's American oil take back are oil.

4580 2018-09-02 20:56:43 That was wrong, he was the leader of a country and did a lot for the people. They shared in the profits coming from oil, the family home could never be sold, I believe he wanted women to be educated. I can’t recall for certain. It was the women bodyguards that do impressed me.
4581 2018-09-02 20:56:37 "If you think this about just you, then I would advise not to flatter yourself. My decision to capture Starks Oil Rigs were based on the interest of my people. The fact that are Stark's just makes it a bonus."

4584 2018-09-02 20:56:14 Quite right. 'Steak chips' are also wrong (too fat); as are 'skin-on chips' (an abomination, and also wreck the oil). As for 'sweet potato fries', I assume that under-18s might be reading this and so will content myself by saying that they are not terribly good.
4585 2018-09-02 20:56:09 石油[タンク]︰an oil [tank]
4586 2018-09-02 20:56:05 Although small pumpkins can be halved &  baked similar to acorn squash: brush with olive oil & stuff with chorizo, nuts, cranberries, turmeric, ginger, fresh ground black pepper and the dreaded pumpkin spice!

Check Wikipedia on how much oil we get from Iraq. Aint much. Geothermal is good R.E., all else is pretty much shit.

4594 2018-09-02 20:55:09 The only reason the Gulf states are advanced is that they sit on millions of barrels of oil, a substance that’s only valuable because of western invention. When the oils gone they’ll be back to herding goats
4595 2018-09-02 20:55:08 finally getting my oil changed 
4596 2018-09-02 20:55:06 Sure.  Maybe the Glob should push for export of oil to diversify away from the US?
4597 2018-09-02 20:55:06 It’s a good time to leverage the slogan against the chemical and oil/gas industries
4598 2018-09-02 20:55:00 Pipelines are the safest way to transfer the oil and gas that powers our country!
4599 2018-09-02 20:54:49 Because of I credibly stupid government, the last hope we have to get our oil to world markets is through the USA. 
OH and I'm pretty sure Trump knows  that also.
4600 2018-09-02 20:54:16 A block of provinces from Alberta to Ontario would provide 2 provinces with oil 1 with the manpower and 2 with significant shale gas reserves, instant economic powerhouse very quickly.

4609 2018-09-02 20:52:55 No it’s called an analogy. Moshing is something that was created as part of the punk/metal scene. Just doesn’t mix well. Moshing to dance music goes together like oil and water.

4646 2018-09-02 20:48:37 Yup, this is a top tip- wee bit of vegetable oil on kitchen paper and rub away. Then rinse / wipe clean. The label remover stuff is good but oil is better.
4647 2018-09-02 20:48:34 meanwhile new kiwibuild homes still out of many reach.  Fact building expensive....why?  Over priced oil?

4651 2018-09-02 20:47:57 Hindus have no oil wells in Maungdaw!
4652 2018-09-02 20:47:53 That Quebec is leaching off of the rest of the country and taking more than it’s fair share.  Your the one who brought up dirty oil Bud
4653 2018-09-02 20:47:44 We should be investing in renewable energy and not destroying countries for oil.

4661 2018-09-02 20:46:25 So then why did the price of gas not go up more than when oil was $15 a barrel and $1 a gallon? Shouldnt greedy Exxon be charging $10 a gallon when oil was $150/bl? (Also, remove gas tax for oil:gas ratio cost). Why didnt we get free oil from Iraq?

4673 2018-09-02 20:45:14 Do rabbits groom ?? If they do, I’d suggest adding some coconut oil around her haunches and as she grooms it out she will naturally get rid of excess fur. I did this with my rats but I’m not sure if it will work with rabbits :”)
4674 2018-09-02 20:44:58 Hi. Not necessarily. But I believe false eschatology is a foundation for apostasy and that now is the time to get our extra jars of oil.
4675 2018-09-02 20:44:27 Use oil :)
4676 2018-09-02 20:44:23 That Abacha loot is for Quantitative easing. It is a common strategy governments around the world use to combat recession. The fall in the oil price is the main cause of the recession, the strategy can potentially increase investment and money in circulation.
4677 2018-09-02 20:44:11 And you never answered why If cannabis cured cancer you'd be cured.  Did you on fact try cannabis oil following the protocol of 1gram a day for 90 days and it actually failed?
4678 2018-09-02 20:43:58 You’re right we don’t go to war for fun. We go to war for oil companies and the military industrial complex. No respect for our troops who participate in these wars for profit.

4687 2018-09-02 20:42:24 The article focuses on fracking for oil. Does she get into fracking for natural gas?

4691 2018-09-02 20:42:04 Peterson serves up what are testicle-wrenchingly obvious platitudes and truisms as vague, knotty word salads. He is the intellectual equivalent of a snake oil salesman, not to mention an obscurantist. His arguments are usually deliberately unintelligible, imprecise and recondite
4692 2018-09-02 20:41:57 Oil is too chep for fracking and fracking has the added cost of wrecking the environment.  A buste bubble might have a good side.
4693 2018-09-02 20:41:44 US lobbyists interfered, and naive but well-meaning protesters were duped! Allowing 37million tons of oil to travel down our coast from Alaska to Wash. annually is a major threat! Wake the hell up!

4716 2018-09-02 20:39:29 For 2016, the value of U.S. energy imports from Canada was $53 billion, while the value of U.S. energy exports to Canada was $14 billion. Crude oil makes up most U.S. energy imports from Canada, averaging 3.3 million barrels per day (b/d) in 201

4723 2018-09-02 20:38:52 Olive oil. Let it soak for 15 mins, then peels off easy.
4724 2018-09-02 20:38:46 And use virgin unrefined coconut oil as a face moisturizer. You only need a little bit and it’s the same ph as your skin so it absorbs and doesn’t make you oily.

4746 2018-09-02 20:36:44 I'm from a small town. I'm noticing, while in #phx, that everyone has a look.  I'm functional, I guess. I wear clothes that could possibly hide oil, dirt, and other stuff. Lol
4747 2018-09-02 20:36:40 Drilling is a dangerous job & not meant for everyone. My husband, brother-in-law & son are all Millwrights. I also have several neices, nephews & son who are Power Engineers. To suggest that oil related jobs are all dangerous to people's health is just plain wrong.

I roasted the pictsweet farms roasted red potatoes and onions in half the time I would preparing them from scratch! 20 minutes, salt, pepper and a little oil and viola! How long do you spend preparing and cooking veggies?
4750 2018-09-02 20:36:33 Read every label and never buy anything containing palm oil.  It's not much but if everyone did the same it may make a difference. Boycott companies who use palm oil .. profit drives everything and if they aren't making it they will get the message and stop using palm oil.

4752 2018-09-02 20:36:13 Do you give the idiot top grades for calling out Saudi Arabia for human rights abuses, the selling them military hardware and taking their oil too?
What about top grades for screwing up every trade deal so far?

4768 2018-09-02 20:32:45 I'm not understanding the issue here.  No one is *owed* a pipeline job at the expense of FN land rights & climate change.  What a massive sense of entitlement.

These families need to move on & find jobs outside the oil industry.  You & they need to stop living in the past.

"People pray for the cake. The batter, eggs, oil, pan, and icing are given to you, so you get frustrated and walk out of the kitchen." Let that sink in.. sometimes you have everything right in front of you, but how bad do you want it?

Hegemony over oil exports is world hegemony.

China's national security will drive green energy to end oil imports,
As that happens, US will abandon Riyadh. Wahhabi terror will diminish.

4800 2018-09-02 20:29:04 The myth that the North will suffer if we restructure is just nonsense coming from archaic, lazy and unintelligent minds.

4813 2018-09-02 20:28:04 You seem to working on the assumption they get the crude oil out of the ground for free.  They buy it from the government ( or whoever owns the land and mineral rights)
4814 2018-09-02 20:27:57 Surely the current brexit shambles has proved to even the most dim witted that there is no mechanism for ejecting a country which is in the eu & wishes to remain. Iscotlands immediate acceptance & the subsequent tearing up of the rUK deal (no fishing, oil, whisky) will be funny

4832 2018-09-02 20:25:38 Yeah. My thought was he either molested on of the girls and killed her so she couldn’t tell anyone, and then killed the other girl as well, and then Shanann after she saw he killed them. Or maybe accidentally? But he wanted evidence gone, putting the girls in oil tanks.
4833 2018-09-02 20:25:23 Neocon Paul Wolfowitz said pretty much the same thing about Iraqi oil, but appended it with, "... to pay for the war." I can definitely see * saying it now. We have no reason to intervene in Venezuela. The U.N. should send troops in if there's a human crisis.
4834 2018-09-02 20:25:18 Honestly can’t beat a hot candlelit  bath with lavender oil before bed
4835 2018-09-02 20:25:07 My thought exactly!  We should be focusing on the future of energy...renewables NOT oil/coal...
4836 2018-09-02 20:25:04 The weather is completely unnatural these days. I've seen the show with the snake oil salesman, also. From the 1960's. Crazy stuff. He talks about building a wall as well as he word ending, doesn't he? Have you seen the Heavy Metal magazine filled with Trump references?
4837 2018-09-02 20:25:00 Con men/flim flam men/snake oil salesmen have been around since..forever. You'd think we could spot them a mile away. Some people will always believe them, maybe because they want so badly for their promises to be true. It's easy to promise, harder to follow through.
4838 2018-09-02 20:24:59 Hey man I am a firm believer in Hemp Oil. It works. Just getting out the military I had PTSD and was prescribed depression medication. I really did not like it at all. Talking with a friend he suggested I try CBD and that stuff works. #firmbeliever
4839 2018-09-02 20:24:56 Uhh? Name one country with vast reserves of oil that would not exploit it to the nth degree...I'll wait.

4842 2018-09-02 20:24:25 The 70% Trump comment is a lie for his base .. Germany gets most of its oil from Norway and the Netherlands... it gets about 35% from Russia .. the USA gets about 21% of its crude oil from Canada .. maybe a solution would be to sell to Germany ...
4843 2018-09-02 20:24:15 They had science and reason before you idiots went over there destroyed their countries and took their oil
4844 2018-09-02 20:24:14 sesame if you want more sesame flavor but if that'd fight the cashew too much and you just want a nutty-tasting oil that isn't too strong, an unrefined peanut oil would be divine
4845 2018-09-02 20:23:50 Shah was socially liberal. Besides that there was nothing progressive about his regime. Ultra right wing.

4855 2018-09-02 20:22:17 if we were reducing fossil fuels as we should, we have enough oil already.  We don't really need a reserve because we will be using much less anyway.  That means we don't have any use for venezuela's resources in the forseeable future.

4870 2018-09-02 20:21:14 Data can be falsely presented, which is why the peer review system was established......so that those doing it would be caught out.

4879 2018-09-02 20:20:25 I think Unai uses a lot of hair oil instead of gel
4880 2018-09-02 20:20:20 I love feeling my tat when I put the coconut oil on it 
4881 2018-09-02 20:20:02 A room full of warmongers responsible for the deaths of millions of people in oil rich countries. Lol. It was heartwarming. Smh
4882 2018-09-02 20:19:55 Lol all of a sudden you want us to live longer? Strange considering your advice has been deadly for 50 years. Remember when Proctor & Gamble seeded your seed oil advocacy group to take the focus off of seed oils and sugar and put them on nebulous calories that no one can control?
4883 2018-09-02 20:19:43 Is your conscience at peace ,saying this? Re examine yourself.
4884 2018-09-02 20:19:40 just burned myself with hot oil while frying plantain..... someone make sure gunna performs at my funeral
4885 2018-09-02 20:19:37 Castor oil for sale! !!!

4889 2018-09-02 20:19:18 I’ve waited almost a year for this oil to be back in stock...guess I can start planning my Lucy Libido class now 
4890 2018-09-02 20:19:18 My alternative solution would be to let other countries make their own decisions and to only go to war when your nation is directly threatened. With real threat not fabricated.

The reality is my nation interferes almost globally. Normally for oil.
4891 2018-09-02 20:19:09 "Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever. Your royal scepter is a scepter of equity; you love righteousness and hate wickedness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions." (Psalm 45:6-7 #NRSV)

4893 2018-09-02 20:18:53 go for it, though i'd thin it down with some oil (sesame, or a mix of sesame and something more neutral depending on flavor, like an unrefined peanut oil)
4894 2018-09-02 20:18:47 Economists are the modern day snake oil salesmen All claiming to have found a cure.
4895 2018-09-02 20:18:47 I said that wrong....Russia wants Assad to be it's puppet and something about oil.  I stick to my guns re Iran wanting to hit Israel. 
4896 2018-09-02 20:18:40 Why dont they keep fixed excise duty say rs 20 or 30 per ltr on petroleum products. There will not be any loss to govt and no extra duty burden on public when dollor or oil price increase.
4897 2018-09-02 20:18:38 It just got a little stuck in place, is all. It might need some oil or something near the places it bends, to keep that from happening again.

    “Is that better?”

4902 2018-09-02 20:18:12 But now everyone uses some for of oil or oil based products. Even bicycles probably have oil based parts. And every Tom dick and Harriet want a huge gas guzzling truck or suv. And everyone must fly somewhere to show how adventurous they are.

4904 2018-09-02 20:17:46 Is it just me or is selling CBD oil the new Amway scheme / work from home scam? Not that the stuff doesn’t work, but watching amateurs trying to peddle cannabis extracts is hilarious - it’s usually those characters from high school who were peddling some other “health supplement”
4905 2018-09-02 20:17:44 I just bought the coco butter that’s made for stretch marks and I never tried vitamin e oil. Thanks

4909 2018-09-02 20:16:55 Thieves Essential oil is my go to now! Rinse with the mouthwash, brush with the toothpaste and then the oil directly onto it
4910 2018-09-02 20:16:55 got my car a oil change now i need my baby shampooed and waxed really good
4911 2018-09-02 20:16:50 Totally agree. Like the claim the other week that coconut oil is like poison
4912 2018-09-02 20:16:49 Always good to pour oil on troubled waters.... unless you’re BP
4913 2018-09-02 20:16:25 No worries! Rail transport of oil has a lower carbon footprint than pipelines. And it is much safer (ask Lac-Mégantic). #Sarcasm #SadStateOfAffairs #TrudeauFail #Canada #Cdnpoli
4914 2018-09-02 20:15:50 I am not alas hehe. I don't so it enough, I have trouble justifying the amount of oil used.
4915 2018-09-02 20:15:45 I’d like to try this for myself and for my dogs. I work in aviation and have very stringent drug testing rules. Is there any level of THC in your CBD oil? I’ve always been scared to try CBD oil for the “false positive” factor.
4916 2018-09-02 20:15:33 .@PrisonPlanet 

Hahahaha. 

Said the syndicated columnist of the LA Times. ( Oh i forgot former editor credential) 

Like watching those Whale oil salesmen predict the downfall of Edison.
4917 2018-09-02 20:15:31 and a greater number tankers will be going through the more risky rosario strait to feed those Cherry point refineries, instead of Canadian oil from a spur pipeline off of the TMX, increases the risk to the whales and of an accident.
4918 2018-09-02 20:15:25 Lmao you’re willing to take castor oil ? Lascon is nice because it doesn’t taste ugly ebile so it’s amazing. As for castor oil, never had it but just the smell puts me off but okay.
4919 2018-09-02 20:15:15 Broke my heart to pay that 60$ for an oil change. I’m sick of bills & gas
4920 2018-09-02 20:15:04 As far as * is concerned,  Venezuela is a shithole country with oil. * doesn't give a shit about the people of Venezuela. He needs UN & Congress approval. Gawd, please tell me he needs approval to start a war!

4929 2018-09-02 20:13:59 @bethanymac12 Hi Bethany - I’m an executive at an oil and gas centric manufacturing company and I’d be curious if you’d be willing to discuss your article.  Big fan of yours but question your methodology on frac economics
4930 2018-09-02 20:13:49 Make no mistake, the reality is Notley, Horgan & Trudeau want Oil & Gas left in the ground.  Don’t be fooled by their BS supposed support for that industry.
4931 2018-09-02 20:13:47 You get more oil from Canada than you do Saudi Arabia.
4932 2018-09-02 20:13:43 From my new book, Oil and God
The book relates US oil geopolitics to Saudi Arabia’s symbiotic union with Wahhabism. The terrorists of 9/11 were Wahhabis. Oil and God investigates why the US destroyed and occupied Iraq, not Saudi Arabia.
4933 2018-09-02 20:13:38 Use lemon and coconut oil it helps
4934 2018-09-02 20:13:36 NDDC don't need to preach peace when they do the right thing. The resources of Niger Delta is poorly managed and the people are marginalised. The people are living in poverty in the midst of oil rich resources and you expect them  to be peaceful.
4935 2018-09-02 20:13:35 Wanna hear something cool? When my son and I were in Europe a few weeks ago, no one had a concept of disposables. I flitted all over London and Paris with an "e-cig" full of cannabis oil. No one blinked an eye.
4936 2018-09-02 20:13:34 Please tell the independent producer how easy crude production actually is... Especially at $25 oil... Your $30 on the top end is approx $4-$5 less to the guys actually doing the work.  As for these aholes promoting $, it's not benefiting those actually in the field.
4937 2018-09-02 20:13:27 Also, Rohrbacher’s idea of “defending the planet” is spending his time in a committee on tracking asteroids. Meanwhile, oil rigs in our beaches are okay with him.
4938 2018-09-02 20:13:26 That's just a rant, I am fine, just tired. 

My skin is dry though, Sweet Oil isn't working out.
4939 2018-09-02 20:13:17 Ya great sources. I forgot memes are the new way to get the proper information. The only thing China moved to is an agreement with Venezuela for their oil supply as we couldn’t get out crap together as a country. You are one of the most misinformed person I’ve come across.
4940 2018-09-02 20:13:15 いちごよりこのりのほうが可愛いってことだよ？
4941 2018-09-02 20:13:13 Except that if you have oil every country wants a piece of your country. They will all plough in claiming they are helping overthrow tyrants.  Apart from countries where they are already making a huge profit selling arms to them.

4945 2018-09-02 20:13:02 "As for the quashed Trans Mountain, Hemmes said it was probably never going to impact rail traffic all that much, given that “grain predominantly looks to move to the west coast and oil looks to move east and south.”
4946 2018-09-02 20:12:57 Too many politicians are beholden to their oil rich masters. Well beyond time to do the right thing. We have lost any moral global leadership.

4962 2018-09-02 20:10:59 I was in the kitchen and cooking with coconut oil, so it didn't really occur to me to go upstairs and get lotion.

I've found that the best way to get it to absorb is to use it just out of the shower, and follow with regular lotion.
4963 2018-09-02 20:10:59 I put coconut oil in my hair one time and now I am a shining beacon of beauty and gloss

4966 2018-09-02 20:10:30 I can use either but defo prefer the one with oil xx 
4967 2018-09-02 20:10:19 Syria, the obvious reasons, wants to control it's own country, Iran wants in Syria to hit Israel, Russia wants Turkey's Ankara airport.  Russia wants to be Assad's puppet and something re oil.

4970 2018-09-02 20:09:49 Canada needs the US. Just look at the numbers. Because idiots won't allow pipelines to be built to use our own oil, we have to ship in from the states.

4972 2018-09-02 20:09:46 The US Govt doesn’t sell oil. Private companies sell oil. That money doesn’t go towards national debt. That’s not how it works.  You see, private companies get to keep the money from the oil they sell

They pay taxes on their profits

This will have ZERO affect on national debt

5024 2018-09-02 20:03:14 I put coconut oil on my dry legs but my skin is too dry to absorb it yet so I'm sliiiiiiiimy 
5025 2018-09-02 20:03:12 Morning: Erno Laszlo mud cleansing bar, Dr. Hauschka clarifying toner, sometimes D Elephant’s C-Serum, Sunday Riley’s day oil, Dr. Hauschka’s Melissa Day Cream (this product has never done me wrong), and Amore Pacific tinted spf moisturizer as my foundation
5026 2018-09-02 20:03:11 With that added revenue stream, it would be cost-effective to open the oil fields in Northern Saskatchewan and Manitoba and get the Alberta oil sands back to peak production.  That could triple our exports. In theory, it could bump us to first over Venezuela and Saudi Arabia.
5027 2018-09-02 20:03:05 The oil industry, the Republican party, the Koch brothers and the Murdoch media all fall on Dr Roy's side - but that has nothing to do with science. (Sorry I repeated '5' in this stream - I'm not so great with numbers!) /7
5028 2018-09-02 20:02:48 I mean if you want to post a really sexy video, this is the start of the script! (Just leave out that random fool and his comments. You changing oil is sexy enough!)

5030 2018-09-02 20:02:40 Yes, my brother, I know that Saudi Arabia, Qatar and some Arab countries do not accept the refugees here. The question is why do not you accept them as Arabs? Can you explain to me why you can not receive them in these Gulf countries knowing that they have the largest oil reserve
5031 2018-09-02 20:02:31 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*
5032 2018-09-02 20:02:28 A6: for me i really need a consistent bedtime routines like children have: essential oil diffuser, putting away electronics, book time, herbal tea, soothing music

5034 2018-09-02 20:02:20 Giiiiirl cleansing oil, exfoliant, gentle cleanser with face scrub, toner, serum, moisturizer and sometimes a face oil 
5035 2018-09-02 20:02:09 Is it just me or do moms not physically burn? Like my mom will straight up take things out of the oven with her bare hands or throw things straight from the freezer into boiling oil without even flinching.

5037 2018-09-02 20:01:45 manuka essential oil smells like the desert
5038 2018-09-02 20:01:06 Nope. The highest public school median math and reading scores in the country. McGill, UM, UQ, Bishop's which are at the top of the country's universities. And a bilingual workforce that is becoming a major international gaming and tech centre. Alberta has dirty oil.

5043 2018-09-02 20:00:19 My point.   So choose to suppprt the oil of ethical people and business as opposed to where some of the oil currently coming into Canada is produced and shipped from.
5044 2018-09-02 20:00:08 Such a nice man.  Too bad you don't do anything but get elected.  Where is energy East?  I forgot you try and get handouts from Western oil. Nice smiles don't pay the bills.

5048 2018-09-02 19:59:48 Gold regularly used as pymt for oil unitl 1974 & it has 4,000 year history as money. 

Central banks hold gold on their balance sheet.

#Gold has the 4 required attributes of money.

China is remonetizing gold by offering gold bar settlement for oil purchase.

5050 2018-09-02 19:59:36 There’s a dead mouse in a jar of oil under our house sink so the mouse thing was correct
5051 2018-09-02 19:59:35 Canadian oils sands, even with all other factors equal, are naturally less efficient for producing oil. That’s because sand is not contained, it is mined. So it’s naturally going to be at a disadvantage to frack oil, which is pressurized in the ground more efficiently. #Diversify
5052 2018-09-02 19:59:15 Dear Brooklyn,

Shoot your guns in the air (both legal and illegal), throw colored powder and oil EVERY WHERE, and calmly remind these gentrifying mother fuckers why Brooklyn ain’t- and never will be- the one.

Kind regards,

5055 2018-09-02 19:58:25 Chips are supposed to be OK if cooked in vegetable oil and they are cut thickly so they don't absorb too much. Lots of vitamin C. Daddy's doctor says a bit of what you fancy does no harm as long as it is not every day.

5058 2018-09-02 19:58:05 @prophetahuva was saying that's why you have Yemen and Kuwait are always poor because Saudi Arabia and America are always stealing their oil
5059 2018-09-02 19:58:04 This is what can #MAGA.  Not looking backward to an expensive, dirty, polluting past. #Trump won't bring this - he's doing everything to stop it, cause his friends in the coal business, the oil sheiks, and the #Russians want America dependent and in thrall to their profits.
5060 2018-09-02 19:58:03 I forgot how much they're selling for. $20, $30?

Appears again the gaudy, tacky snake oil conman is using his usurped office for his financial gain.

I saw the Kim and Dotard "summit" one for sale, someone tweeted it.
5061 2018-09-02 19:57:55 If Canada sold its oil for OPEC prices in Cdn dollars, the difference would be $211 billion dollars a year, just checked again, the national debt was higher ( you're right) it's at $630 billion, so 3 years.
5062 2018-09-02 19:57:43 นอนไม่หลับ
5063 2018-09-02 19:57:41 Stop tweeting and using your computer. You are promoting oil.
5064 2018-09-02 19:57:27 How about China buying Iran Oil using Yuan in direct violation of OFAC Sancations. How about that?
5065 2018-09-02 19:57:25 It pretty much is.  I only go there now when there is a deal on oil I can use on the Mazda 2 because I like to buy individual quarts which ends up being the same at Walmart. The car only uses 4 quarts so the 5 quart jugs are an inconvenience.
5066 2018-09-02 19:57:25 Or lets ban oil and move completely to electric
5067 2018-09-02 19:57:21 A few yrs ago a Sen assured us there won't be flood (sea level rise) because he found God's promise to Noah (Gen 9:11) more credible than science. On Day 5 of Creation, God must've put residues of billions of trees/animals in the ground to give us coal and oil for later.
5068 2018-09-02 19:57:15 Do not get caught up in trying to decide which Middle East sewer nation is our friend and is better than the others - not possible & well we created the mess Bc of commodities - Zapata Oil - 3 cheers for capitalism ( Irving kristol) yeah was bad too
5069 2018-09-02 19:57:06 America’s biggest oil importer is Canada. Biggest is Saudi Arabia, a country US has not invaded. Besides I want us not not only alow the citizens to have their own democracy, but to spend money to help rebuild infrastructure.
5070 2018-09-02 19:57:04 The recipe I'm following made no mention of oil. I make no comment as to whether or not this is the right approach as this is my first time.
5071 2018-09-02 19:57:00 Exactly, the Anglo-Iranian oil company. British MI6 were heavily involved as well I believe. We can only wonder how Iran would look today if it wasn't for this malign intervention
5072 2018-09-02 19:56:54 Reason still there: Bush/Cheney once Kabul liberated decided to go after Iraqi oil...

5081 2018-09-02 19:55:28 "You shall probably find out from your national news." 

*BREAKING NEWS*

US OIL RIGS HAVE BEEN CAPTURED BY ATLANTEAN FORCES, OIL RIGS OWNED BY STARK INDUSTRIES. 

"Hmm.. that was reported faster than expected. Your Surface Media is to be commended."
5082 2018-09-02 19:54:57 "Saudi oil lover" hahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaa.
5083 2018-09-02 19:54:51 Absolutely.    Coconut oil after every shower 
5084 2018-09-02 19:54:49 Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. The scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of uprightness; you have loved righteousness and hated weakness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions;
(Psalm 45: 6-7, ESV)
5085 2018-09-02 19:54:47 How exactly am I brainwashed? Who exactly does my views benifit other then the people in those regions? I want to nationalize weapons production and eliminate oil consumption.
5086 2018-09-02 19:54:47 The entire middle is a sewer fueled  by oil rvenues & terrorism trade & proxy wars & protecting countries from terror- see what they did there - created a whole industry - yep Michael chertoff is trash - he’s not alone Madeline Albright is pretty bad too 
5087 2018-09-02 19:54:42 Like eating, sleeping, working on hundreds of thousands of bbls of crude oil.
5088 2018-09-02 19:54:40 Obviously never want them.

5095 2018-09-02 19:53:53 Details like like Igor Sechin offering Trump through Carter Page a 19% private stake in Rosneft, a 12 billion dollar Russian oil company ? Or Michael Cohen visit to Prague ?
5096 2018-09-02 19:53:38 Ooh, I have just smeared frankincense oil all over my ancient sourpuss mush!
5097 2018-09-02 19:53:36 Shop cheap oil from Canada. Source goods from other countries. Bypass America from MX by sea. Find new customers for our commodities. Fortress America will falter.
5098 2018-09-02 19:53:22 Another useless and worthless Fellow. Doesn't understand any thing of oil and petroleum.
5099 2018-09-02 19:53:19 DHA deficiency increases risk. See article linked to in tweet and video presentation for more information. Non-vegans also at risk if diet quality is poor but prevalence higher in vegans and vegetarians b/c plants contain no DHA. Algae oil supplements critical.

5103 2018-09-02 19:52:59 Basically,Iranian people democratically elected a secular socialist government(Labour Party whose leader was Mossadeq).This was the one major step towards& perhaps the only real opportunity Iranians had for achieving democracy. Mossadeq nationalised oil. CIA arranged Coup.

5105 2018-09-02 19:52:23 Good markets throughout the world for fish and oil.
5106 2018-09-02 19:52:22 I’m deep conditioning my hair all day today cuz I will be straightening it and I have oil dripping all down my forehead in public 
5107 2018-09-02 19:52:14 It's amazing how quickly one can prepare a super tasty meal. 
Tonight: sliced zucchini/courgettes, cherry tomatoes, organic chicken breast, topped with a sauce of mustard, olive oil, honey, and chopped garlic. Wrappend in tinfoil, baked in the oven for 25 minutes. Bliss. 
5108 2018-09-02 19:52:01 You could fuel a jet with the oil coming off of my face good lord
5109 2018-09-02 19:52:00 We are going backward in the US by continuing to favor investment in oil and gas over investment in renewable energy. Oil and gas drilling requires a lot of capital and a drop in oil prices can shut down wells overnight. Few companies, outside the majors, can ride out price drops
5110 2018-09-02 19:51:55 Marinated in soy sauce, grated garlic & ginger, lime & orange juice/zest, chopped cilantro. Tempura was mix of corn starch, flour, S&P and garam masala. Pan fried in canola oil until golden brown. Made glaze of orange juice, brown sugar and soy to drizzle over top while cooling.

5112 2018-09-02 19:51:30 yes,people from KARAK mainly faces diseases like cancer and other caused by exposure to uranium and sulfur associated with oil and gas
5113 2018-09-02 19:51:10 Bush was a front for a collection of bullies, all of whom possessed the same repellant qualities that Trump acts upon daily. Bush was just as far in the tank to the oil and gas industry as Trump.Trumps crime is waving it in our faces.
5114 2018-09-02 19:51:10 No thank you phone call customer for telling me about your opioid recovery from me just saying “no we don’t carry CBD oil”
5115 2018-09-02 19:50:35 all these battery acid, nordhausen acid, oleum, oil of vitriol and vitriol are just sulfuric acids H2SO4 puta
5116 2018-09-02 19:50:31 It will come from Canada, as well. Not increasing oilsands production (our dirtiest, least valuable oil for which Canadians get negative returns if the cost of remediation is included) is not the same as stopping all oil production or even oilsands production in Canada.
5117 2018-09-02 19:50:28 It's like I got a great big mouthful of cod liver oil
5118 2018-09-02 19:50:27 To be honest, we should also have a look at the other side of the coin. California has enormous polluting oil and gas industry that is not having plans to decarbonise. One million low-income people living in the neighbourhood and having serious health impacts.
5119 2018-09-02 19:50:19 What about the oil made of dead dinosaurs?
5120 2018-09-02 19:50:11 in order or riggedness it goes bonds fx oil stocks.  gold in there too of course.  mkts are now like utlities, govts have to manage them because they are too important to the economy and society
5121 2018-09-02 19:50:10 I despised George W in office. He was an unqualified trust fund baby, who lost $ in oil, bought a baseball team w/ his frat bros, got elected gov of Texas & somehow became POTUS. Nepotism at its finest. We forget because he’s old & funny now. Also Satan is currently in office.
5122 2018-09-02 19:50:03 Grenade launcher would be first

5125 2018-09-02 19:49:32 Status of Oil Ref of Karak?
5126 2018-09-02 19:49:30 The process is not the issue here.  The fact is that ALL of Canada benefits from the HUGE contributions AB makes to this program. No one in Canada will benefit from shutting down AB oil industry development.
5127 2018-09-02 19:49:28 Watch out for the lawnmower kart engine oil at lunar bend! 
5128 2018-09-02 19:49:21 Bro its just olive oil packaged nicer.
5129 2018-09-02 19:49:19 We’re all snorting stress relief essential oil to go over this 23 mile long bridge that goes under water twice
5130 2018-09-02 19:49:15 The oil and gas industry has a stranglehold on local regulation in Colorado. Local city, county governments can regulate and do planning and zoning on any topic except oil and gas which gets blanket, one size fits all regulation from Denver.
Oil & Gas Commission is bought!
5131 2018-09-02 19:49:13 みんなで油祭りしようよ。英訳するとオイルフェスティバル。
5132 2018-09-02 19:49:07 Aka a new source of OIL!
5133 2018-09-02 19:49:07 Yeah sure man! My main motivators were A. the hope that the voices of anyone other than conservatives will now be heard in Texas, and B. the fact that he isn’t funded by oil and gun money. His policies aren’t ideal for me but they are a lot closer than Cruz will ever be.
5134 2018-09-02 19:49:06 I believe that before going upscale, the tar sands crew  "upgraded" bitumen in Alberta and then shipped the upgraded product, which was much easier to ship (lower sulphur amongst other things) and if spilled behaved like crude oil rather than a bitumen/naphtha cocktail.
5135 2018-09-02 19:48:53 Have had to explain to oldest whay snake oil means. She's come back from Burghley Horse trails with a special mahic bracelet with a special magic hologram that helps you balance your body with special magic. Thirty five pounds of snake oil.
5136 2018-09-02 19:48:51 not really but seemingly like iguana...and now i think you perceived about that oil
5137 2018-09-02 19:48:39 Jesus Chicken. How’s the weather under that rock? Huge losses of FT jobs, investors pulling up and running, no new ones on the horizon,  alienation of out trading partners, $10B deficit, major projects cancelled, auto industry hanging by a thread, oil industry suppressed...
5138 2018-09-02 19:48:37 There is definitely not enough oil to sustain our lifestyle up to 2400, so our descendants will not have large CO2 footprints, unless they use coal, and basically burn the Earth, and die in the process.
5139 2018-09-02 19:48:35 The deadline will oil out the rigging process. Just think about it.

5143 2018-09-02 19:47:48 There's some oil in there. Enjoy!
5144 2018-09-02 19:47:12 Showing your ignorance on issues is no way to lead, Lee. How about acting like a congressman instead of a long-time listener to info wars who just chugged a quart of whatever snake oil Alex was hawking?
5145 2018-09-02 19:46:56 Hopefully the flag of it’s own country soon. Tired a getting treated like a second class citizen from our supposed neighbors, just because the province has oil & gas.
5146 2018-09-02 19:46:54 I’ve been reflecting a little. Whatever happened to Rex Tillerson? He had a lot on the line with the Russian oil being an oil tycoon himself. Has anyone seen or heard anything about his time in trumpland?
5147 2018-09-02 19:46:44 @LaBeautyologist @caveofbeauty @Brieyonce should I spend the bread on the Tatcha cleansing oil or buy an oil on amazon instead? 
5148 2018-09-02 19:46:43 To heal a pimple quickly, apply tea tree oil on pimple every few hours, and apply vitamin E oil on the spot, about 1 hour before bedtime.

don't forget their huge oil reserves as well, and that trump bemoans the fact that we didn't steal all of iraq's oil after we invaded there.

5179 2018-09-02 19:42:50 @seunokin NNPC under @MBuhari is as corrupt as under @OfficialPDPNig . Ghost companies are buying stakes in our oil blocks without paying one dime.
5180 2018-09-02 19:42:36 Its harmful for your teeth, contains more than 50% of sugar and the rest is vegetable oil which is not healthy too(other than olive oil). So you're eating more oil and sugar than chocolate. You can try 99% dark chocolates. Its bitter but you get used to it.

5194 2018-09-02 19:41:06 wonderful sir, a small suggestion, drive should be for plantation of  high value trees e.g palm, coconut, orchardad, teek, nuts, rubber trees  from which we can also earn and export their byproducts like palm/coconut oil, rubber, wood etc.Regards & God bless Pakistan

5203 2018-09-02 19:39:53 Very well said. Somehow Albertans got the idea that their interests and the interests of oil companies were one and the same. Certainly there is some mutuality of interest, but oil companies serve shareholders, not a citizenry. And recent industry consolidation shows that.
5204 2018-09-02 19:39:49 Could ask the same of oil companies and myriad others...
5205 2018-09-02 19:39:25 Naked and smothered head to toe in coconut oil is the way to spend Sunday night
5206 2018-09-02 19:39:19 the drop in fdi to ng was due to the crash in oil price, Kenya attracted more inflows because its a bit diversified. i still think NG will attract more overtime. the current administration is making some giant strides which i think will yield positive outcome overtime.
5207 2018-09-02 19:39:19 We are finding oil faster than we can use it. Peak oil is a greenie myth, that's recycled every 2 decades. We have enough oil for the next 10,000 years. It may even be renewable, many now think it is 
a-biotic in origin.

5209 2018-09-02 19:39:02 why is there a bottle of olive oil in the shower @mogx25
5210 2018-09-02 19:38:56 Very true! Eg: @RachelNotley refuses to use the words native or indigenous when talking oil and gas royalties PL & she seems to believe we are part of the fabric of CAN/Provs yet we are ignored, chastised even killed! As my dad says they only want our land & oil #genocide

These companies aren't dumb. They killed those upgraders as soon as Sinopec made it clear they'd handle the upgrading at home.

5218 2018-09-02 19:37:33 It illustrates oil's lack of relevance to power generation, and renewables' growth rate.

Seems to clearly indicate fracking contributes to little other than transportation, for what that's worth.

Power generation is not oil's niche.
5219 2018-09-02 19:37:22 Hood forever I just act like I'm civilized, really what's in my mind is organizing a billion black motherfuckers to take over JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and teach the world facts and give Saudi they oil back.

5223 2018-09-02 19:37:02 I will never waste $10 on tanning oil when coconut oil is $2.88 & last MONTHS & also gives you a more healthy and darker glow
5224 2018-09-02 19:37:00 Yes, for both oil & gas. Shale gas resource is huge, many decades.  More gas can be produced at higher price levels.  No international source of gas economically threatens domestic gas. US oil a bit more vulnerable but still in good position.
5225 2018-09-02 19:36:50 People also tend to forget the most of world is awash in cheap food.  Something that has never happened before in history.   There is one reason for this. Internal combustion engines powered by diesel oil or gasoline.  

No oil.  No cheap or or no food depending on where u are.
5226 2018-09-02 19:36:39 Yep. Fair enough.  

From $SPX perspective, USOil can go higher, but from $YUAN $AUD $NZD perspective, it could go lower.  I only occasionally trading USOil for a swing, no long-term commitment.  I am not an expert on Oil.

5232 2018-09-02 19:36:15 It’s a soft landing, combined with effective industrial espionage given to large American companies in exchange for surveillance, and also wars are profitable for banks, oil, and defense companies.

5234 2018-09-02 19:36:08 put lavender oil in your shampoo!
5235 2018-09-02 19:36:02 They’re just gonna train it and truck it. Fuck the rivers right? “Huge win” I’m not sold on our shitty oil but this isn’t a win. Stopping the pipeline is counterproductive.
5236 2018-09-02 19:35:56 Frackers are highly leveraged. Bad loans will stress lenders.  Fracking is supposed to keep the U.S. energy independent for many years to come.  Their production influences oil prices and inflation.  The question is fracking at what cost? We need more switching to renewables
5237 2018-09-02 19:35:51 InfoChip's rugged #RFID tag carriers can withstand extreme temperatures, exposure to #oil, chemicals, water, dust & other contaminants.
5238 2018-09-02 19:35:48 Sry, Lis, last just war was #WW2 against Nazi Germany, Italy and Japan.  No other war following WW2 had anything to do with our FREEDOM, just 'our' oil.

@senSanders, see how deeply confused ppl get about the  #socdem platform.
5239 2018-09-02 19:35:41 I didnt know that does the rag absorb the oil so it dont leak out?

5247 2018-09-02 19:34:39 GERS is fake news (even though the SNP used to quote it all the time).  Scotland is on the verge of an oil boom.  It doesn’t matter that the SNP has no idea what currency an Independent Scotland would use.  Oh and Alex Salmond didn’t molest (at least) 2 woman.  THE SNP IS A CULT!
5248 2018-09-02 19:34:37 I am appalled by statements like these from all the elites. Are we going to ignore slavery? or America’s invasion of innocent country’s for oil - police brutality and the separation of baby’s..

Observer is going down so deep that I think he'd fall of the log.
5252 2018-09-02 19:34:15 This story is a joke. 
Friedman had totally forgotten that energy (oil) was not infinite and that it generates a massive pollution leading us probably to the collapse of human civilization at the end of the century.
5253 2018-09-02 19:34:00 I’m against foreigners intervening to steal oil & further their geo political Goals. The US & U.K. couldn’t care a less about human life. The US intervened in Syria via the CIA program Tyber sycamore they just lost to Iran & Russia. The Yazisis would be fine if Iraq wasn’t a mess

5265 2018-09-02 19:32:33 I give dems props for being ruthless and cut throat. Republicans project playing by rules, being gentlemanly and dignified. Dems will ram through what they want by any means and make no apology. Gotta give them credit there. Formidable foes for sure.

5267 2018-09-02 19:32:17 Nor did I pay the extra $1200 a year for the privilege of driving all the way out to them for my oil changes.
5268 2018-09-02 19:32:16 Petrol in Turukana = Ksh. 137
Petrol in Nairobi = Ksh. 124
Petrol in Mombasa = Ksh. 127
Petrol in Kampala = Ksh. 112

It's now cheaper to fuel your car in UG than in Mombasa.

So much for being an oil exporter.
5269 2018-09-02 19:31:53 And it's nothing more than bullying to say BC should be satisfied with $6b worth of revenue and the potential for trillions of cost while Alberta keeps the bulk of the revenue from Canada's oil (it was till 1953 when pipelines started, then refineries closed in BC and now AB oil)
5270 2018-09-02 19:31:49 Bwahahahaha... poor baby. Unfortunately, Alberta "invested" it's money in giveaways to the oil industry. All future Canadians will have to pay the 100s of billions of cleanup costs, not the companies and not the Alberta government that has given away the resource.

5281 2018-09-02 19:30:41 Orajel is alright it's just an analgesic to numb the pain but clove oil is that plus an antiseptic and stronger in my opinion so you might find it at like a CVS some places sell it as "Eugenol"
Good luck, man

5290 2018-09-02 19:29:58 My 2019 base case has global oil prod +1.1 mmbpd, while demand +1.2mmbpd, for a net deficit of 100mbpd, resulting in an annual decrease in global inventory of -36.5mmbbls. This does not include any brown-outs/SPR, beyond IR and PdVSA combining for -1mmbpd of avail prod. Thoughts?
5291 2018-09-02 19:29:56 That was a smart move by Morocco that could insulate it from some of the effects of the next oil shocks, which are inevitable.

5293 2018-09-02 19:29:30 Can't get over the moment when Muhammad Jam (sitting in the rear of a police mobile) says liquor bottles found in Sharjeel Memon's hospital room contained honey and oil and the uncouth reporter asks "Konsa tel? SAANDAY ka tel thaa?" 
5294 2018-09-02 19:29:22 Oil pan or intake gasket wouldn't be too bad. Hoping it's not rear main. Sounds like no engine damage, that's a relief.

5296 2018-09-02 19:29:00 If you think the people of nitoba are goi g to allow Manitoba to just dump oil in Hudson's Bay, you are delusional. Not to mention Ontario and Quebec. It's the same problem.  Not to mention there are no refineries there just like in BC.
5297 2018-09-02 19:28:48 Uh guys,
Oil companies raise and lower gas prices and OPEC pushed supply during the Obama years to cause price of crude to be below $45/barrel. Great boon to slow economic recovery.
Bad for US oil companies.
Trump has actually slowed the Obama economy and his trade war will too.
5298 2018-09-02 19:28:45 Margaret Dunning, who drove a 20s Packard that her parents bought new until she died (at the age of 103,) could still change the oil in it! I think I heard the car went to the AACA Museum.

5305 2018-09-02 19:27:59 It’s always about money and how they control the US petrodollar for oil. That’s the real reason why Sadam Hussein and Khaddafi are dead, because they wanted gold and not petrodollars for their oil.

5308 2018-09-02 19:27:48 too many are convinced that using oil, a natural resource earth provides in plentiful amounts, is a SIN.

5321 2018-09-02 19:26:38 There’s this thing called oil consumption that is increasing every single year, with no peak in sight.  Constricting Canadian oil with a ctax will have zero effect on how much is produced or consumed globally...it will just come from a place other than Canada.

I bet not...
5337 2018-09-02 19:24:31 Nearly none, in the US.

A little bit, world-wide, but prices for transportation fuel are higher than for power plants, so most oil goes to transportation, and plastics production.
5338 2018-09-02 19:24:27 Read the article, if you haven't. The money that comes into Kurdistan during the oil exploration boom puts the turbo chargers under a system that had already been largely formed by the historical development of the region.

5349 2018-09-02 19:22:45 Kenya killed her sugar factories and now imports sugar at sky rocketing prices. Again, even been in the list of oil producing countries in Africa, the prices of petroleum & diesel fetch higher more than the local market prices of a country perceived to be a failed state, Somalia!

We cut trade with you
We increase with TPP and CETA

And we will buy from them

5357 2018-09-02 19:21:35 What most people just can't understand is that tight oil formations have very limited productive life expectancies, and, after they're gone, domestic oil production is over, potentially forever.

Tight oil was, at most, about a 20-year play, when we started.

Now, about 10 to 15.
5358 2018-09-02 19:21:33 Been to a car dealer to look at a 2nd-hand runabout. Very impressed with how he has prepared it: car was dirty but the old oil filter had been polished with T Cut, the tyres were covered in black paint and there was more grease on the salesman’s hair than on the wheel bearings.

5371 2018-09-02 19:19:57 Using oil in a process is different then omitting carbon into the atmosphere. Most modern factories that use oil such as refineries and asphalt Roofing product factories have controls in place and systems to prevent Wayward carbon from escaping into the atmosphere.
5372 2018-09-02 19:19:24 A reminder; there is a pipeline, Enbridge Line 3 under the Mackinac Strait. We need govt that says NO to oil and actually protect the lake.

5377 2018-09-02 19:18:41 We already have an example. Equatorial Guinea is small and rich. The country's population is only of little more than a million people, and while not quite as rich as Iceland, it had a GDP per capita similar to Israel and Czech Republic. All thanks to oil.

5416 2018-09-02 19:13:11 The Jackals are always ready to frustrate all efforts to bring transparency and accountability to the oil and gas sector. Nigeria need a sincere President to reform the sector, @MBuhari  seems  not capable enough
5417 2018-09-02 19:13:10 Wait, I got it, let's sell the strategic oil reserve to the Boston Redsox. We won't even miss it!
5418 2018-09-02 19:12:38 They taste like oil and sugar.
5419 2018-09-02 19:12:28 And Big Oil will continue to deny climate change. Same reason...corporate profits.
5420 2018-09-02 19:12:27 Syria is having a war becuase of 2 pipelines. One that would be controlled by Russia and another one controlled by U.S. and its allies. Like most middle east wars it's never about democracy it's about money, power, oil & control. Im with ya

5422 2018-09-02 19:11:53 I have super oily skin and absolutely love both the primer and the priming spray as skin prep products. I still use my regular oil controlling products on top. Oily skin peeps still need hydration, and the hangover products are great for that! 
5423 2018-09-02 19:11:46 Or the alternator bracket gasket went bad. Oh wait, that's only on mid-2000s BMWs (like mine).

And yes, they do have alternator brackets with gaskets holding back high-pressure oil, and yes, it's a stupid design, and yes, it's 8 hours of labor to replace a $5 part.
5424 2018-09-02 19:11:37 Petro doesn't' have any users or investors. It doesn't have any oil to back it up either - Report #cryptoking
5425 2018-09-02 19:11:34 State of public safety/security has moved beyond crisis proportion. Our impending national wealth and status as the leading oil and gas producer of the region, demand we fix our personal and public safety epidemic.
5426 2018-09-02 19:11:31 Socialist party wherever they have control are the biggest unions that exist. Trumka is one that knows if U.S was a full blown communist country he would not be affected at all. 
It's good to be one of the elite
5427 2018-09-02 19:11:15 Down 15 pounds. Working with @ddturner1023 inspired me to burn oil in the gym.
5428 2018-09-02 19:11:10 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
5429 2018-09-02 19:10:57 @Ziphelele_ Hi, I just bought the two products today, do I use them simultaneously? I'm using tissue oil after the scrub (is that okay?). Thank you #ZeTalkZa
5430 2018-09-02 19:10:28 Aubergine can soak up lakes of oil, and then slowly release it. A wonderful Greek cook I slightly knew told me how too avoid this (complicated process) but can't find instructions now. Anyway, hers was quite oily - but delicious.

5434 2018-09-02 19:10:00 Qatar is looking to expand its investments in German companies, including so-called Mittelstand firms, which are often family-owned businesses, the oil state's finance minister said. The Qatari investments will total several billions of euro, Handelsblatt learned.
5435 2018-09-02 19:09:55 Sometimes the most popular perspective isn't accurate.

Funny how near all of Hollywood opposes Trumps administration and his agenda.  After all- they ARE actors who get paid for their work. 

When the money is followed, who are the financiers? Where does Arab oil profits go?
5436 2018-09-02 19:09:44 Coffee is to my body as oil is to a car.
5437 2018-09-02 19:09:26 Aur aap sharjeel memon k room se milny wali sharab ko oil and honey kahy... Mashallah
5438 2018-09-02 19:09:22 Don’t be bitter Nora that oil money pays you’re children’s daycare fees.
5439 2018-09-02 19:09:22 No threat? Saudis helped fly two planes into the World Trade Center.  If it weren't for the fact that they controlled oil, and held upteen billions of dollars in US government bonds, we wouldn't bend over backward to appease the Whabbist savages.
5440 2018-09-02 19:09:21 He went on a mission in Costa Rica where he stopped a rogue faction of the US government and rescued a doctor named Emmerich who specialized in building walking robots. They went back to their oil derrick base and built a nuclear-armed robot for deterrence.
5441 2018-09-02 19:09:15 Years ago I visited often , now I struggle to get down to old warden , I hope that will change soon , a most wonderful place and the castor oil still lingers
5442 2018-09-02 19:08:59 Gave Moose his first dose of CBD Oil..I'm sold. He slept all night until 4am. Snoring. I didn't sleep as good, I kept waking up making sure he's okay. Past 2 wks he would get up to go potty at least 2 times. But his body seemed to be relaxed. I Gave him No pain pills YAY!!

5445 2018-09-02 19:08:18 Does it sometimes feel as though everyone has their preferred method of scrambling eggs — except for you? I often feel that way, and start second-guessing my technique every time I start melting the butter in the skillet (or is it olive oil? And should this be cast iron?)

5446 2018-09-02 19:08:14 i haven’t heard it lately, but it used to be an ANDP talking point that even with an ndp government alberta still has the lowest tax rates in canada. like, is that something to be proud of? i’d rather have functioning public services than low taxes for oil corporations.
5447 2018-09-02 19:08:05 You have the most creatively interesting and healthy looking food. I was just posting something about mayo made with avocado oil and then your post popped up
5448 2018-09-02 19:08:04 What for they killing thousand of thousands people (including children and women) in Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan? Oil? Money?
5449 2018-09-02 19:07:59 Imma definitely need a oil change when I get back
5450 2018-09-02 19:07:54 Later he went independent under the name Militiaries Sans Frontiers (military without borders, play on Doctors Without Borders) and built up an oil derrick home base with his friend Kaz Miller.
5451 2018-09-02 19:07:39 Godspeed
5452 2018-09-02 19:07:37 Minnesota they are offering truckers huge bonuses. 

North Dakota they are paying truck drivers 120k around the oil fields.
5453 2018-09-02 19:07:29 Saudis are a cash cow for the west (£billions in arms and oil deals to the west), Zim - with due respect - is not in that league and therefore sanctions are enforceable for human rights which sins the Saudis are paying off with the above deals!
5454 2018-09-02 19:07:28 Not really, because a lot of our manufacturing got crushed already. Partially because of trade deals to allow BC to export lumber, and you guys to export oil. Our manufacturing was the sacrificial lamb. Automation has also really hurt that area. We are way too heavily

5457 2018-09-02 19:06:56 You know what, I knew you was going to say that.  But sadly these days. If teams likes city and Chelsea come along with oil money, then yeah. They can buy a full team of players every season. Like both of them clubs did years before they won anything...
5458 2018-09-02 19:06:52 Tea tree oil. Tastes terrible but it will get rid of them the fastest..
5459 2018-09-02 19:06:51 Today the #FreedomToBreathe bus tour heads to Port Arthur, TX. A coastal city of 55,000 people, predominantly African-American and Latinx. The Energy City is also responsible for 6.3 percent of American oil refining.
5460 2018-09-02 19:06:50 Rear mains don’t usually go quite THAT bad. I’m guessing drain plug or filter came loose, or oil line to a cooler failed.
5461 2018-09-02 19:06:36 Indian govt is exporting oil at half the price to other countries that Indians are paying (refined #petrol to 15 nations at Rs 34/ltr & #diesel to 29 countries at Rs 37/ltr).

Where are our taxes going?

5465 2018-09-02 19:05:57 We could have a no imports policy. We don't need imports. We have our own oil, water and food. We can build more power generation stations. We can buy new looms. We can buy new factories and robots.
5466 2018-09-02 19:05:55 So you agree Canada should use our own. Upgrade the Eastern refineries to handle AB oil. Done. Best idea ever.

5471 2018-09-02 19:05:26 Life as we live it won’t continue if we keep using oil. Do you actually understand that?
5472 2018-09-02 19:05:22 Would you shut the fuck up. You have an entire fucking report with you ... did you even fucking read it??? Did you see where the US government confirmed Atiku has been rich and the primary source of wealth is Oil Contracting?
5473 2018-09-02 19:05:21 Hehe, nadaan sa castor oil.
5474 2018-09-02 19:05:18 "Our dependence on oil is a giant problem and we know it will lead to our destruction. We must transition away"

"You fucking commie I bet you use oil all the time"
5475 2018-09-02 19:05:13 14 For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.

5476 2018-09-02 19:05:00 yeah i can't eat it at all because of the peanut oil. ig peanut oil is purified so it's allegedly non-allergenic but the last time i ate there it still gave me a reaction so
5477 2018-09-02 19:04:57 According to BP the earth only has 53 years left of oil in it how is that not a bigger deal than it currently is.
5478 2018-09-02 19:04:25 Y’all gotta start checking y’all pussy like oil Mfers really need a dip stick in there 
5479 2018-09-02 19:04:13 Indeed, the debate is still on as to the health benefits of coconut oil due to it being high in saturated fatty acids which has been linked to high cholesterol.
5480 2018-09-02 19:04:08 “Like Castor oil, I’ll Castor Troy you, change your face, or bullets change all that for you”
5481 2018-09-02 19:04:07 What’s next? The great British tartan kilt? This has got to stop. They are taking our oil, now rebranding our whisky, our shortbread...next they will be denying Scotland ever existed. We are fighting here for our country and cultural identity. #DissolveTheUnion
5482 2018-09-02 19:04:07 There’s also no guarantee Gio is any good. Rotation and bullpen have both been leaking oil since start of August outside of Chacin.
5483 2018-09-02 19:03:52 Yesterday’s game confirmed 6 things 1: @deanhenderson is a legend 2: oil Norwood is class 3: Washington is going to be a major signing for us 4:

5484 2018-09-02 19:03:46 that's exactly my point. 

That one is a good/brilliant OAP or journalist doesn't mean that he/she doesn't require professional/technical guidance, especially in specialised fields like banking, economics, oil & gas, law,  medicine etc
5485 2018-09-02 19:03:45 I’m confused everytime you tweet. You talk about renewable energy, electric cars and getting off the resource economy in one tweet then build a oil refinery in AB next. Just like @jjhorgan wants relief on gas prices, BC wants oil and gas just #BCNIMBY @OilsandsAction
5486 2018-09-02 19:03:41 Mediocre league
5487 2018-09-02 19:03:41 I saw a tweet that was like “we wouldn’t have the weekly occurrence of finding out an artist was problematic if y’all stanned actual gay artists” and they were right why didn’t y’all stream OIL OF EVERY PEARLS UN-INSIDES by trans legend SOPHIE
5488 2018-09-02 19:03:35 Trim fixed, AC fixed, oil changed, and full tank hallelujah to God to be able
5489 2018-09-02 19:03:33 And with the flick of a whim the oil & gas industry ended. The extraordinary made ordinary.

5491 2018-09-02 19:03:12 @CityLuxembourg Hellooo how can I dispose of my used cooking oil?
5492 2018-09-02 19:03:00 I send you my heartfelt message. As the parent of a disabled son, I know how hard it is to fight Medicare & Medicaid. It angers me that our citizens health is not a concern by many in our Government.   Have you looked into CBD oil ? Many are having miraculous results.
5493 2018-09-02 19:02:47 OMG who cares GW is responsible for millions of deaths in a war fought for oil ....he should be in prison.
5494 2018-09-02 19:02:18 Putin has his eyes on the arctic
There’s oil there
Canada is in his way
Geography will probably prove its Canadian oil

Putin won’t accept that
5495 2018-09-02 19:02:06 I respectfully disagree, the middle political part WAS in anger on behalf and in honor of her father.  America did not just memorialize an insurance underwriter.  Agree with is political positions or not, he was one of the top political figures in our history and he had a message
5496 2018-09-02 19:02:00 No, you are correct, oil is currently necessary for some areas due to geography. But if you had other options, would you take them? Hydro electric (if it wasn’t so expensive), solar, wind, geothermal?
5497 2018-09-02 19:01:58 Bio oil really helps btw
5498 2018-09-02 19:01:53 صدقت والله قهر وتخلف حسبنا الله ونعم الوكيل بس
5499 2018-09-02 19:01:44 Actually Obama has no record to run on because in less than eighteen months, President Trump had broken every Obama's records and resurrected the buried automobile, coal, steel, aluminum, oil and gas industries and that gave room to more jobs and labour participation in US.
5500 2018-09-02 19:01:39 .@smartass furthermore Chuck, trump is an x rated 5x draft dodger, Putin sychophant, divider, fake patriot, hates most americans, bigot, "look at my african american", shredding EPA to enrich big oil/mining,he hasn't done jack sh*t for the good. Ivanka was at McCaines funeral.
5501 2018-09-02 19:01:05 @CTVpolitics Re ADP chair Interview: 
The answer Yusuf Sani gave on whether his party will support Restructuring Nigeria shows that his party has nothing to offer Nigerians. They too just want to take their turns in the Nigeria oil money. No true governance without restructuring!
5502 2018-09-02 19:01:01 Canada’s newest oil sands mine, Fort Hills, is matching the GHG emissions intensity of American refined oil. That’s an enormous accomplishment. There is so much every Canadian should know about this topic, instead it’s just an avalanche of misinformation.
5503 2018-09-02 19:00:53 Cats go after the smell. The oil traps the fish scent better. That’s what the vet told me when my senior cat stopped eating. Then me gave me special STINK ER food for cats. It was gross, but Shadow loved it.

5519 2018-09-02 18:59:35 @prophetahuva was telling me sometimes oil can come from Kuwait but by the time it's getting here it's been labeled Saudi Arabia.
They do this so that the money can be paid 2 the Saudi govt not Kuwait. 
Prophet was telling me they are the greatest thieves in the world @KingSalman
5520 2018-09-02 18:59:29 a) southern Italy is a much more welcoming place. Go to #sardegna instead. 
b) never try to surf on a wave of burning oil
c) beds are extremely large in Italy, just look at the bed sheet they use for their tifosi flags 
d) never offer to do the ironing for a tifoso

5531 2018-09-02 18:58:23 Even d news'per quotes her as saying "..because of d dwindling price of oil"...says it right there

Bloomberg can say this n it's gospel,but all d inter'nal bodies and P'Ministers who have come n said we r capital of poverty,2say a few, u guys don't want us to believe it..haba!
5532 2018-09-02 18:58:18 I don't think we should purchase anything from the Saudis until they clean up their human rights issues, let alone oil. We shouldn't so much as buy a paper clip off them IMO
5533 2018-09-02 18:58:18 You should work with just cruel oil transported in barrels and send it so whoever you sell it to will process it in their facilities the whites refuse to buy it from you now that you have taken back the land

5537 2018-09-02 18:57:46 Like Nigeria, their power was subsidized.

They've been forced to reduce subsidies due to the effect of the oil price crash on their economy..
5538 2018-09-02 18:57:42 #Guardian on #Starbucks #pumpkinspicelatter disposable cups: they may look like paper but are lined with polyethylene, plastic that needs crude oil to manufacture and makes them essentially unrecyclable.

5542 2018-09-02 18:57:17 Considering planting palm tree will cut down import bill of vegetable oil and enable in long run to export and earn foreign exchange like Malaydia in past have done it.
5543 2018-09-02 18:57:10 OPEC is a big cartel. Apparently you can't produce oil and refine your own oil

5545 2018-09-02 18:57:06 #Beto, #winning #Texas means introducing yourself to the Northwest hill country and pan handle and east Texas badlands. I would not fault you for drinking #oil on #camera.
5546 2018-09-02 18:57:06 I saw these thanks. I don’t pin everything on the oil folks nor expats alone. The dysfunction in KRG is real and unacceptable—especially for locals. It’s enormously complex. Would love to go back and do the work this subject deserves rather than sniping on Twitter. 
5547 2018-09-02 18:56:59 We let the Saudis bring oil here. We let Nigeria ship it here. Venezuela etc. no protest. Hypocrisy at its finest.
5548 2018-09-02 18:56:57 It would be wise to utilise vast area of Cholistan desert and plant jojoba trees . It will have dual utility . Plants bring greenery to desert whereas the oil of its fruit will help earn a few million dollars .
5549 2018-09-02 18:56:53 SO, hindi ko magamit yung essential oil kasi di ko bet yung amoy  bat kasi walang pang amoy sa lazada app yung parang kiskis chenelin sa brochure ng avon?! 

kbye
5550 2018-09-02 18:56:15 I sear my stewing beef with coconut oil. When it's done, it all gets chucked in & cooked slow.
Braising is good too. And nothing beats fillet cooked on skewers over a campfire whilst wild camping. Even if we did have to improvise the skewers!
5551 2018-09-02 18:56:09 Last night I did *twelve* packages of boneless chicken in the sous vide. Lunch for the family today: ONE package of chicken tenders, patted dry, lightly seasoned, and then pan fried in olive oil.
5552 2018-09-02 18:55:52 Yeah
5553 2018-09-02 18:55:45 BS. Why don’t you target Saudi oil or Nigerian. Canada does it better than anyone in the world. Canadians don’t appreciate what we have.

5555 2018-09-02 18:55:29 The sentence not context
5556 2018-09-02 18:55:27 Yes, many things.  Such as each town having their own AC or DC "grids" at various voltages.

And I would not rule out early oil barrons having something to sell and excerting their influance on auto production.

And a lack of knowledge regarding pollution.
5557 2018-09-02 18:55:21 I just got an oil change by myself and only had to call my dad once I’m so proud
5558 2018-09-02 18:55:17 I would rather boil my bollocks in hot oil, we are the UK, not Canada or Norway
5559 2018-09-02 18:54:54 So it's kewl then, no biggie guys Sam just vouched for him. It's all good now we can joke about it. It's been like 10 years after all those dead people are already turning into oil for Sam's Hummer.

5572 2018-09-02 18:52:43 Exactly what I've been saying.We buy oil from Saudi Arabia?Yet want to ship super cheap diluted Bitumen to the orient?It makes no sense.Bailing out stockholders of a Texas Oil Giant is treason.That's our money.#enrichingthe1percent
5573 2018-09-02 18:52:42 Amy, been there, done that. It sucks. Check the oil level first. My Saturn Vue was old enough that the check oil level light would come on for no reason. A sensor had gone bad.
5574 2018-09-02 18:52:36 Just stop the selling of half price oil to the country below us.
5575 2018-09-02 18:52:33 garlic is so good, i cover everything in it and my family hates me. i never use olive oil except for risotto because it adds a nice creamy texture to it (IM CRAVING RISOTTO NOW UGH I HAD IT LAST MONTH SJS)

5583 2018-09-02 18:51:20 @prophetahuva told me that theoretically we get oil from Saudi Arabia and Qatar but in the real sense Saudi Arabia steals oil from Yemen, Kuwait and Nigeria to sell to African nations.
Saudi Arabia are the greatest thieves @KingSalman
5584 2018-09-02 18:51:17 They will still need massive investment in coal, their oil and natural gas demand are rising rapidly.  Renewables can't provide reliable on demand power at grid scale, and grid scale storage doesn't exist.
5585 2018-09-02 18:50:51 Currently getting an oil change, then birthday gift shopping, and then the birthday party.. Busy Sunday in full effect!! 
5586 2018-09-02 18:50:32 I'm gonna need more cbd oil for my joints that shit works wonders
5587 2018-09-02 18:50:29 It's true that AMLO's strategy for Mexico to grow more of its own food and refine more of its own oil would reduce dependence on the US, which is great. My worry, though, is that Mexico is about to sign up to a new NAFTA that would continue this dependence in many other ways.
5588 2018-09-02 18:50:19 Y do u say so
5589 2018-09-02 18:50:15 Great deals await..their courteous quick service people do my scheduled maintenance and oil changes around my life not theirs.. consider that when you consider buying
5590 2018-09-02 18:50:11 Still can’t believe the oil comments garnered so little outcry
5591 2018-09-02 18:49:54 But OIL TANKERS,  bring 'em on!
5592 2018-09-02 18:49:54 Israel are fucked once Iran is dealt with.

This whole buddy act will evaporate the moment the Iranian regime is changed.

Will we choose oil or Israel?

We need the oil, but we are owned somehow by Israel. Should be interesting for 2030-2040 war season.

5594 2018-09-02 18:49:23 Not all CBD oil has THC (the psychoactive ingredient in Cannabis). The oils work thru their action on cannabinoid receptors in the brain
5595 2018-09-02 18:49:22 It’s a global effort, and yet oil demand continues to increase worldwide, meaning blocking Canada’s oil shipments will only serve to enrich countries like Saudi Arabia at our expense. But that’s ok, I guess they have to fund the Yemen bombing campaign somehow, right?
5596 2018-09-02 18:49:20 Oh I know all about that. My step-grandfather was from Brooklyn so we heard all kinds of names for things. Like batteries were bat-trees. Oil was earl.
5597 2018-09-02 18:49:16 During the workday, million tonnes oil equivalent or metric tons are most commonly used. But late at night after several glasses of wine, Crap Ton becomes the preferred unit of account. :-)

5600 2018-09-02 18:48:49 You better not wait too long to get an oil change sis.
5601 2018-09-02 18:48:29 Goenka Ji . I really appreciate govt performance so far. But I dont understand why rupees is falling down ? Despite of low crude oil price why petrol price is high ? I wud like to know from u. Bcoz when i speak about these stat ppl simply attack with these questions
5602 2018-09-02 18:48:20 You can’t for the first 24 hours but after that just be careful getting them wet and clean them. Don’t use oil based products either because that’ll make them fall out.
5603 2018-09-02 18:48:10 @GOP and Donnie Orange need a distraction. Venezuela’s got oil; it’s nearby; and unlike Iran it’s unlikely to fight back. All big pluses they think.
5604 2018-09-02 18:48:04 Only if the kids were dying with cancer, etc. could this be justified,and even then CBD oil would be more appropriate.
5605 2018-09-02 18:48:02 I thought i was being creative...
Pepsi and Castor oil instead of sprite and syrup  now my stomach is upside down...
5606 2018-09-02 18:48:01 Take a look in Nigeria and see true  GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra by British govt and their jihadists to steal oil and gas.

5613 2018-09-02 18:47:02 Oil seed rape sets me off terribly, I'm now using it in cooking and it seems to be having a positive effect. Really full nutty flavour too
5614 2018-09-02 18:47:01 I talked to @prophetahuva about the oil issue and she said they have been working on it. It's the demonic Saudi Arabia  and their fellow thieves that leads in this thievery that they wake up one morning and decide to increase the oil prices for their benefit
5615 2018-09-02 18:46:55 @dpradhanbjp aaj oil prices ke wajah Se mere jaise self employment wale log apni commercial car ni chala Pa rahe hi aur car ka EMI bhi ni de pa Raha hu.... Iska responsible kaun hai sir??Aap ya Mi jo apko Mandate diya???
5616 2018-09-02 18:46:53 Currency flows and the history of how commodities, oil in particular, have been intertwined with currency, bonds, and gold is certainly important to study. But yes, the tail can't wag the dog sustainably. Oil market always succumbs to supply and demand, and *rate* of each.
5617 2018-09-02 18:46:45 Don’t need their effin oil or nat gas.
5618 2018-09-02 18:46:40 Ty for response! Curious about factories then, one the biggest users of oil. Are there many factories or manufacturing plants in CA?
5619 2018-09-02 18:46:36 Cars are just like humans, don’t google to figure out why it’s broken, just go get it checked out. Everyone thinks all they need is an oil change to fix why it won’t start.
5620 2018-09-02 18:46:33 i haven't been to Olive Garden or Applebee's but i can tell you how to make tortellini alfredo with peas, bacon, garlic, parmesan, thai fish sauce, chinese hot chili oil & red pepper flakes... which will be decadent & the same price as any entree on their menu.
5621 2018-09-02 18:46:30 To continue, it would be like asking the heads of the oil industry, gasoline engine car companies, and competing electric car companies what they thought of the first Tesla - but framing them as "experts". How is this good journalism and not just flame-throwing?

5627 2018-09-02 18:45:28 oo i never do either, i like the taste of olive oil (and garrliiccc) with it but really hate when it’s overwhelming cause i can’t handle oily foods well :’(
5628 2018-09-02 18:45:14 A combo of Young Living thieves and clove essential oil. Works like a charm.

5630 2018-09-02 18:45:11 I've heard coconut oil is good x x x
5631 2018-09-02 18:45:04 One word Abacha! Atiku was one the biggest Oil contractors in Nigeria. His company, Intels serviced not just Nigeria but several African countries, which made Abacha jealous. So rather than domicile his money here, to avoid his account being frozen, they had to store it elsewhere
5632 2018-09-02 18:45:03 treasury shud think out of the box. vat on oil is common sense it does not require any class of economics. Vat on oil impossition on Kenyans is nonsense
5633 2018-09-02 18:44:50 And I’m talking about the oil based perfume none of that alcohol based cheap shit
5634 2018-09-02 18:44:42 Here's a question Ponziboy, how many of @AndrewGillum 's followers are actually Chinese Communist 'Bots? Now why would the Chicomm's not want a Trump Supporter as gov. Because Trump doesn't want Chinese Oil drilling off our Florida coastline? It's right there in front of you.
5635 2018-09-02 18:44:34 Virgin of Texas. Extra Virgin Olive Oil.
5636 2018-09-02 18:44:34 Irrelevant. You can't have a sustainable culture with either bc both equal ownership which causes imbalance and irregularity in energy flows. And I don't mean oil or electricity.
5637 2018-09-02 18:44:33 MacD
5638 2018-09-02 18:44:25 Of course.  We preach and honor God regardless. However, it requires a special oil to speak to dry bones. Not for the weak at all.
5639 2018-09-02 18:44:24 Oh Joy, well, he will be if he keeps up the thug tactics.  He doesn’t miss a trick for scamming money.  Best snake oil salesman ever
5640 2018-09-02 18:44:22 #sundaylive the cost of fuel is higher in Kenya than land locked countries like Uganda,  Ethiopia, Burundi among others that obtain their fuel from Kenya. To make it more interesting, Kenya discovered some oil in Turkana, where is the oil taken, why milk poor Kenyans this much.
5641 2018-09-02 18:44:20 There is NOTHING more awkward than sitting in your car during an oil change
5642 2018-09-02 18:44:04 If you have any teatree oil it helps get it off!
5643 2018-09-02 18:43:52 Indeed. In the Oil Fall series, I am using the larger vehicle category as China's aggressive push is broadening out. So for example, I have 28.8M vehicles sold in 2017 w/ 777K of them plug-in. But to your larger point: my view is that ICE vehicle growth will flatten in 24 months.
5644 2018-09-02 18:43:51 We are grasping for air because of Trump. At least his blood for oil game wasn’t overt.
5645 2018-09-02 18:43:50 Its lean...

5646 2018-09-02 18:43:42 Man what?!?

5649 2018-09-02 18:43:33 I beg that bwana Duale listens to his statements. In fact, just like the other 3rd rate citizens, I feel cheated very much by the 1st & 2nd once. Why export oil why the demand is causing us such nightmares?
5650 2018-09-02 18:43:17 Sounds like either a hole in the oil pan or a blown rear main seal. I’m hoping it’s the oil pan.
5651 2018-09-02 18:43:13 If you believe this then I have some amazing snake oil to sell you...
5652 2018-09-02 18:43:10 Can’t wait to get home & do a hot oil treatment 
5653 2018-09-02 18:43:07 Come to think of it, I don't know what significance pouring cooking oil in rice has
5654 2018-09-02 18:43:05 so get some tea tree oil, shea moisturizer black soap. and bull dog face cleanser. you can also do witch hazel if you want. but my man had the same problem.

5656 2018-09-02 18:42:56 #1/ Good question, I am going to guess it has something to do with our dependence on "blood oil" having resulted as a result of deals struck and poor refining decisions made by previous canadian governments.

5681 2018-09-02 18:39:48 "Eons Ahi" isn't a freshness date: it's ahi wrapped in Twinkies & deep-fried. There's apparently no need for a freshness date when loving encased in a shell of Twinkies which have been welded into place with hot boiling oil.
5682 2018-09-02 18:39:48 Yes, coconut oil is one of the ingredients (:
5683 2018-09-02 18:39:26 The majority of the citizens of this country did not vote for him, don’t support him now & never will. He’s a snake oil salesman
5684 2018-09-02 18:39:25 But, it doesn't have to be and the energy side is changing to other, renewable forms.  Yes, oil will be integral to our civilization for the foreseeable future but it is evolving.

5686 2018-09-02 18:39:18 Yum! I love olive oil tasting too!
5687 2018-09-02 18:39:04 I never thought to apply oil before applying waterbased products to minimize chances of shrinkage. Water and oil don’t mix. I used to apply product then oil to seal... not gonna do that on dry stretched hair though.
5688 2018-09-02 18:38:56 Swish coconut oil in your mouth for a minute. It will help get rid of the bacteria in your mouth to help it heal faster.

5692 2018-09-02 18:38:23 You have a good point.  Have you ever noticed around the world, whenever a country goes from poor to becoming a rogue nation with oil or minerals, that it all comes back on us? Subsidies not a good idea!

5730 2018-09-02 18:34:31 The big oil companies have plenty of coffee-shop-ready forecourts on which they could do this.

5739 2018-09-02 18:33:57 There are some people who consider peppermint oil safe for dogs but most sources will tell you it’s not a good idea. I’d avoid it if I were you 
5740 2018-09-02 18:33:55 The SGC specifically excludes any tax from oil. This would be used for special projects and not for general spending.
5741 2018-09-02 18:33:38 I'm wondering what caused it to puke out all the oil and that's another issue altogether, but under 30 seconds is good and the motor might not be trashed. Was it knocking or anything?

5749 2018-09-02 18:32:52 What has happened to the price of oil??
5750 2018-09-02 18:32:32 Zimbabwe is on fire. 4 mining companies shutting down. Cement scarce. 2kgs rice now $8. Cooking oil disappearing from shelves. Drugs fast becoming scarce. There's still no cash. We have seen the new cars. When are you going to deal with bread and butter issues? Muchadzoka nemari?
5751 2018-09-02 18:32:26 I mix the oil and the banana and put the rest in slice and mix it again (^-^)

5753 2018-09-02 18:32:14 Shouldn't take long to fix, but did you just have oil changed? I ask this because they cut the gasket once doing mine and that's why the oil leaked out right away. Made them redo it free of charge.
5754 2018-09-02 18:32:12 The Greeks bankrupted their own country by not paying their taxes and retiring at 50. The EU saved them from themselves. The Swedish thing is FAKENEWS to coin a phrase and Norway is rich because it didn't squander its oil revenues.
5755 2018-09-02 18:32:03 The coconut oil seems to help it harden pretty promptly. Sometimes I cut it up the next day, but UGD was very excited so we cut it up about 7 hrs after the cook.

5760 2018-09-02 18:31:42 We should turn on the pipes and let the oil flow, then use the revenue for developing and supporting a transition to green energy.

5783 2018-09-02 18:29:22 Ronald Mutie...Dont we have Oil inTurkana that we are now purpoting to export? Why cant we build a small refinery here and we can even refine for Uganda then we cushion our shiling and reduce the heavy taxes.
5784 2018-09-02 18:29:21 Apparently I work at a grocery store that doesn't sell cloves or clove oil. Well, I found oil, but it seems to be the kind for diffusers. I got Orajel MAXIMUM! Doesn't feel very maximum, but it helps. And I got a dentist's # from a customer. So there's hope! For my mouth, anyway.

5791 2018-09-02 18:28:13 Unfortunately things in the nation cost money, the middle class need jobs now, not in 15 years when we’ve developed wind and solar to a level that employs masses like our oil sands. We buy oil to consume anyways. Perhaps let our sit in the ground while we go into poverty?
5792 2018-09-02 18:28:08 As far as I understand, the situation became worse in recent years with the lower price of oil and with the sanctions. I am not an economist, but I can imagine that particularly before 2014, life in Russia under Putin was better in comparison to other periods in Russian history.
5793 2018-09-02 18:28:05 lol that's funny. People? Probably 4 or 5 billion. Life was hard but my point is that the got along just fine without oil. Unless it was from animals.

5818 2018-09-02 18:25:11 It's also worth noting the U.S. consumes almost 19 million barrels per day of oil. They're a long way from oil self sufficiency, hence the continued demand for Canadian oil.
5819 2018-09-02 18:24:41 A blatant truism; that which is also in transition. Oil centrality is much less true today and it will continue to attenuate as the hydrocarbon age itself recedes into its oleaginous sunset with the advent of new technologies.

5836 2018-09-02 18:21:55 Well it's hard to get fat off of chicken unless you drench it in oil, chicken is pretty light in calorie density while being very high in protein, so you're probably going to get full long before you can eat enough chicken to exceed your TDEE.
5837 2018-09-02 18:21:55 I wish Ca. Legislators had as much respect for us & our Constitutional rights as you do.  We can smoke pot, but oil is outlawed as of 2042. Both should be left alone. Oh, they are raising taxes again to pay for it.

Is it okay ?

But try applying coconut oil its good for dry skin
5862 2018-09-02 18:19:12 I'd rather refine oil in Alberta than force bitumen down a long pipe for other regions to refine. Better still, Alberta should stop investing precious time and energy into outmoded technology. We have to get off oil sooner or later... sooner is better for Alberta AND the planet.
5863 2018-09-02 18:19:05 Ummm.... YES! Reuters' youngest oil reporter.. 
5864 2018-09-02 18:19:01 Because they're fools listening to partisan media and oil & gas-funded propaganda, if we're honest. 

Nutrition science has similar problems to medical science. The question you should be asking is why don't they doubt their doctor?
5865 2018-09-02 18:19:01 Also, there's an unjustified leap in the argument from "many shale companies are over-indebted" to "therefore US oil production is unsustainably high". In Chapter 11, investors lose money, but assets keep producing, and even attract new investment

5885 2018-09-02 18:16:59 We just got 188 gallons of heating oil delivered. It cost about $500. It heats the house and water and will hopefully last a few months!
5886 2018-09-02 18:16:54 That was the propaganda, and now the truth. The $1.5 billion was a PLAN for ALL of Canada's coastlines - Arctic, Eastern seaboard AND west coast. It will do NOTHING to stop or clean up an oil tank disaster. NOTHING.

5902 2018-09-02 18:15:06 CS spray is typically much more concentrated, can take a couple hours with washing eyes to recover. Also even washing hands after cutting chillies usually is not sufficient, you can wash them a few times and the oil still hides under fingernails etc.

5917 2018-09-02 18:13:53 Oil money goes quite the distance! Actually goes from liberal to liberal in power worldwide. Islam must dominate politically if they cannot spread it physically! It's in the Muslim brotherhoods manual on how to defeat the West!

5929 2018-09-02 18:12:04 Uh no - pension paid by me and the plan my money is invested in. I have no issue with oil money - that resource belongs to me as much as the industry. I have issues with shortsightedness in planning for our energy future.

5963 2018-09-02 18:08:57 I’m refurbishing an old, driedout cutting board. Is there a wood stain I can apply that will allow me to still work a lot of food safe oil into the wood?
5964 2018-09-02 18:08:56 Lucky you. I've taken to ignoring him, since he can't conduct a conversation without immediately deflecting, gaslighting or outright propagandising for oil & war industries. Trust me, you're not missing out on anything by losing our good chum al eros' contributions.

5966 2018-09-02 18:08:51 Bethany, I wd've sexed it up w/ “In 2016 Chesapeake's CEO Aubrey McClendon—married into the Kerr-McGee (Karen Silkwood) family—was indicted for oil and gas lease bid-rigging. The very next day, he drove himself into a bridge abutment at 80 mph.” But that's just me. Nice piece.
5967 2018-09-02 18:08:41 Excellent way to explain our need for oil. Until there is a paradigm shift away from oil Canada should take full advantages of our natural source...OIL. Open the pipe lines. Build Refineries. Sell Oil and Gasoline. R&D into other alternatives in the mean time.
5968 2018-09-02 18:08:35 Go solar how bout that? No oil spills, no environmental catastrophes, no drilling up our land and water, no random deaths from industrial accidents, no waste disposal.

5970 2018-09-02 18:08:30 Big oil will spread fear about the eventual "sticker shock", and then try to make that true by undermining the solar industry every chance they get.

5976 2018-09-02 18:07:44 Bush repeatedly ignored warnings of 9/11 & invaded the wrong country, killed its leader under the pretense of hitting back but really because Cheney wanted the oil.He has the blood of 9/11 victims,American soldiers & Iraqi civilians on his hands.but next to trump he looks good.

Hello. I capriciously discovered a magical natural remedy for relieving physiological head and body stress anxiety. I don't think many people know about this. Mix 3 pinches of cinnamon together in a tablespoon of Nutiva brand hempseed oil from Sprouts, and consume.

5990 2018-09-02 18:06:30 i’ve been an honoured guest at banquets in china where the food wasn’t that far off - pigs blood dropped into oil that then pops in your mouth releasing warm blood into your mouth - frog intestines in soy sauce ! etc
5991 2018-09-02 18:06:29 Many older Oil fans are just now starting to appreciate what a cosmic event getting Gretzky,  Coffey,  Fuhr, Messier, and Anderson so early in the team's formation.  Once-in-a-lifetime event and we took it for granted and we were arrogant!

5995 2018-09-02 18:05:52 Good plan.  And you're right.  Your grandma most definitely wants the Bitcoin that everyone is talking about, not the incompatible one that snake oil salesmen claim is real.
5996 2018-09-02 18:05:48 Our country has a profoundly flawed history. Slavery, the virtual elimination of our native population, engaging in multiple wars fought at the behest of the fruit , oil and other industries. Voter suppression is still a problem. Decreasing amount of safe water. And more.

5999 2018-09-02 18:05:15 Don’t do politics much on here but to leave Canada out of of NAFTA is crazy. All three countries economies are interlocking! Canada’s assisted oil supply/reserve is what help keeps gas prices from being $6/gallon. I think Canada only has a military to help support the US. #SORREY

6014 2018-09-02 18:03:19 Did you ever put your feet in Venezuela?

Chavez was a true socialist. He made some mistakes, but he wrestled oil from foreign corporations, lifted millions from poverty and controlled the army. 

Maduro is just an incompetent  puppet of the miltary who betrayed Chavez heritage.

6023 2018-09-02 18:02:10 Tokens? Them Dems use minorities like a hipster uses patchouli oil! Free this, free that. Because someone of color approves of Trump, that makes them a token? Your lack of common sense is very disheartening. I feel for your disability. Hang in there, little buddy!
6024 2018-09-02 18:01:20 Oil is indispensable for our wellbeing. So, even if Canada ceased production of the stuff, you would need to import the oil from elsewhere. Just try to live 3 months without oil products.
6025 2018-09-02 18:01:20 Tell that to Quebec regarding energy east.  Maybe when the transfer payments dry up because there is no oil the light will come on..

6042 2018-09-02 17:58:59 Well, let's see. First the earth cooled. And then the dinosaurs came, but they got too big and fat, so they all died and they turned into oil. And then the Arabs came and they bought Mercedes Benzes. And Prince Charles started wearing all of Lady Di's clothes.
6043 2018-09-02 17:58:54 Was a lot of “we’ll never win it again” after the Gretzky sale, understandably, and especially after LA eliminated Oil in ‘89, Oil blowing 3-1 series lead. A lot of people wouldn’t give up that bitterness to enjoy 1990.

6054 2018-09-02 17:57:58 He's telling the truth. Russia is in syria legally, the USA is there ILLEGALLY. John kerry admitted just that. Its all about oil as you well know. It has squat to do with "the Syrian peoples suffering" as the west keeps spouting.

6059 2018-09-02 17:57:34 @ProfTimNoakes 66% of coconut oil consists of Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCTs), which the body treats differently from other saturated fats. Even if sat fat were bad (it's not) coconut oil as poison is based on profound ignorance of how different fats are treated in the body.
6060 2018-09-02 17:57:27 I’m not saying we shouldn’t invest in alternatives but to think we should handcuff our selves to do so is a bad idea to say the least. The more money that comes in from the oil industry is money that can be put togood use elsewhere
6061 2018-09-02 17:57:23 Whoever it is at the core of @TheDemocrats leadership who keeps turning toward #DemocraticSocialism is perhaps the most destructive political influence in a tapestry of ideological horrors. It's as much a part of #Putin's strategy as Levant region #Oil reserves and poisonings.
6062 2018-09-02 17:56:57 Dunno. Is it oil based or water based? Recipes for butter often use both water and fat.
6063 2018-09-02 17:56:55 ginger, garlic, scotch bonnets, lime, thyme, vinegar, sugar, s+p, oil, allspice, scallions, have i missed anything?

6067 2018-09-02 17:56:14 Other countries don’t have similar circumstances which makes them incomparable in their approach and goals. Canada is unique. With our oil being landlocked and in al reality a ticking clock on the industry we should do our best to use what we have on hand for as long as needed

6074 2018-09-02 17:55:30 America profits from Canada's oil by refining it. That's the main reason they won't build refineries in Canada ... profit & jobs.

Extractive industries in Canada not only export resources, they export value-added jobs.

6085 2018-09-02 17:54:18 Just when #Venezuela needed to recur to the alternative use of renewables in the middle of an electric power crisis and lack of oil, when we had the money to invest in them instead we got corruption and money stolen. Now we see the results. #oott

6091 2018-09-02 17:53:03 You should see my local Facebook group - it's half "where can I get fairly-traded vegan almond butter with *no* palm oil?", half "if the police won't act it's time we took things into our own hands". I'm not at all convinced they aren't the same people.
6092 2018-09-02 17:53:03 National flag... Southern

Green on the flag... Southern
White on flag ...more southern
What has the north really offered but empoverishment?
6093 2018-09-02 17:52:58 @FbpeReynard Ground cinnamon and hemp oil to relieve persistent head and body stress and anxiety.
6094 2018-09-02 17:52:56 Rub beard oil in my beard so I know it’s real
6095 2018-09-02 17:52:55 Without coal, gas, and oil revenue, Wyoming is dying on the vine. They’ve severely tapped the principle of their Mineral Severance Fund. There is no tolerance for liberal thought in Wyoming. The fence around the state continues to grow in depth and height. Dont be like Wyoming.
6096 2018-09-02 17:52:40 Ain't nobody going to convince me that Israel is Saudi Arabia's friend.
It makes no sense. The only thing that does make sense to me, is Israel controls The World Bank and the price of oil is set by the Saudis which determines the value of the dollar. Israel:Saudis as Nukes:Guns
6097 2018-09-02 17:52:26 I tried to embrace kale but discovered I only really “enjoyed” it when massaged with olive oil and put in the oven. Think the healthy bit was lost
6098 2018-09-02 17:52:14 My argument is that the best oil and gas controls are to move towards eliminating it entirely. Of course we have to do that in a manageable way over time, but to think what we’re doing now is the most we can do is false. Other countries are way ahead of us.
6099 2018-09-02 17:51:49 haha,, funny how we used to talk about Tullow Oil but now there is an increase in the VAT!  wow.. just wow.
6100 2018-09-02 17:51:36 Can you do fried hairs with your sword's oil ?
6101 2018-09-02 17:51:34 When will she teach them about the wonderful successes of Socialism throughout world history, and most recently in oil rich Venezuela???? #Sarcasm
6102 2018-09-02 17:51:29 Good to know. We are very happy.
6103 2018-09-02 17:51:13 I need some more oil
6104 2018-09-02 17:51:10 Somehow Sunday Ticket showed up on my bill. Didnt notice it last mo. 2nd payment of 6 at $48 n change. Canceled it and got 2 mo refund. Beware, may be new tactic for viewers?
6105 2018-09-02 17:51:06 The biggest question, in my mind, is how Canada can partner with Alberta (and other provinces dependant on oil and coal) to clean up industries and energy supplies.
6106 2018-09-02 17:50:57 Attn: The Trump admin. cleared the Dakota Access oil pipeline on Friday, saying that further environmental review didn’t bring up any new concerns. Even after it had five spills in its first six months of operation.

Just because Pruitt is gone, doesnt mean the fight is done.
6107 2018-09-02 17:50:51 Need to enter into Manufacturing field soon.  Launch 10-12 herbal/ayurvedic products. Even if 1 clicks you get set for lifetime. Emami bought Kesh King oil for a wooping 1700 crores not much time after its launch.
6108 2018-09-02 17:50:48 CBD oil... And she is a paramedic who says it cures everything...
6109 2018-09-02 17:50:03 Just oil them slightly and stick them on the BBQ. 
6110 2018-09-02 17:50:03 I’ll grant that Oregon ranks low in education funding, but please point to a Republican policy that fixes it. As for the rest, homelessness and climate change are a direct result of R policies that decimate the safety net in favor of tax cuts for the rich and the oil industry.
6111 2018-09-02 17:50:02 @WBrettWilson has morphed in to a vicious and linear oil industry shill without remorse or reservation. No measured thought or reason, his sole focus is the bottom line for the petroleum industry. Fair enough but don’t expect rose petals thrown at your feet Brett.

6113 2018-09-02 17:49:26 Oil dey your head

6115 2018-09-02 17:49:12 We'd live in a town for a month to 2 months then move doing Oil Exploration & I did that for over 5 years! From the top of the Rockies (Montana) to the Their Bottom (New Mexico), Midwest (Ka, Ok,Tx), & a little trip into Louisiana!
6116 2018-09-02 17:49:10 Are you trying to compare a oil spill to a nuclear meltdown ? Wtf ?
6117 2018-09-02 17:49:06 i lost my oil pen a few weeks ago @ kellys old apt and found it last night in her couch cushions (@ her new apt) so now i have two, blessings on blessings , let something go and it comes back to u it’s urs forever 
6118 2018-09-02 17:48:59 No sir, they are an expert in convincing others that they are an expert. Example - Al Gore has made millions peddling snake oil (global warming)
6119 2018-09-02 17:48:52 I remember my 1st time it was during the day and I stay next to the mall so I went to the supermarket... Was the oil not all over my face and back??? 
6120 2018-09-02 17:48:47 Democracy is just a myth, in reality it's every man for himself Democratic countries bombing so called dictators for oil and dollar protection. No one is better than the other it's all about the money.
6121 2018-09-02 17:48:44 Pretty sure it’s some bullshit type of oil they use.
6122 2018-09-02 17:48:38 Yeah ok that’s enough for me. Keep on supporting the btec oil money Barca 
6123 2018-09-02 17:48:27 I say let them all starve themselves the prisons in the oil legals and then send them all f****** home why do we even care these illegals have no right in the prisoners good let me won't have the taxpayers paying for them either

6126 2018-09-02 17:48:21 “Vanilla oil..” Selene says quiet but the words roll playfully off her tongue. She looks up, her head gently tilting to reveal more of her neck.
6127 2018-09-02 17:48:13 I’ve never tried za’atar, but cauliflower roasted with olive oil, garlic and lemon is also very delicious.
6128 2018-09-02 17:48:03 Ritualize the 7 day white candle with the lavender oil to redeem and restore.  
Pray over it to redeem and restore balance. 
Recite Psalm 23
Sage candles
6129 2018-09-02 17:48:02 Experimenting in the kitchen. Xantham Gum + oil + ThickScream (Schmand) + Vinegar has some weird clumping going on.
6130 2018-09-02 17:47:50 but what if the water is covered by a substance less dense, such as oil? then the water is wet with oil
6131 2018-09-02 17:47:35 Ahhh, so it's like those essential oil kits that hot topic used to sell that were packaged to look like potion ingredients?
6132 2018-09-02 17:47:26 Indian govt is exporting oil at half the price to other countries that Indians are paying (refined #petrol to 15 nations at Rs 34/ltr & #diesel to 29 countries at Rs 37/ltr).

Where are our taxes going?
6133 2018-09-02 17:47:26 My advice to guys is to fuel at National Oil. Why? Because its funded by GoK. Demand for fuel will go down and for petrol stations to keep margins up, they will probably start cutting corners. Don't be shocked to hear that unleaded petrol has run out but v-power is available.
6134 2018-09-02 17:47:22 You guys, lavender black castor oil really relaxes you. 
6135 2018-09-02 17:47:21 Thank you for pointing this out. No, you are not just lucky, and no, don’t think it’s just because you’re not in a city. I know decent fair landlords in London.
6136 2018-09-02 17:47:04 Same to you and yours. UKOG has brought investment to life for us, it’s our PF favourite. I think the ‘Eyes’ live feed make a big difference. Here’s to a good week!
6137 2018-09-02 17:47:03 then what is ur(Govt's) role? then in that case , all d good things happening r also due to external(favourable) factors. is thr any increase in domestic crude oil production during past 51.5 months?why not? any increase in Merchandise Export? why not?

6141 2018-09-02 17:46:44 it’s crazy to think about how all the things people need n desire are really natural resources...like water...oil...diamonds...gold(money) like wow.
6142 2018-09-02 17:46:39 Great job. And so true. Here in Oklahoma all follow trump blindly.  Langford said he was against raising the deficit. He lied about that. Inhofe who is in pocket of oil and gas. Mullins involved in work violations. Had to repay 40,000 dollars to company involved in trump problems
6143 2018-09-02 17:46:38 I don't feed man white flour or bad oils. I recommend whole wheat bread & pasta and olive oil if anything. They are probably the best to my current knowledge. Animal suffering is the priority for veganism, & as vegans we reduce the number of unnecessary deaths for our existence.
6144 2018-09-02 17:46:37 Yep so you going to blame USA for PDVSA problems with oil? Classic Corbyn supporter reply - it’s a conspiracy, his policies are sound and his leadership would look awe inspiring if it weren’t for...insert appropriate Scooby Doo type excuse here.
6145 2018-09-02 17:46:33 Summers really over, my coconut oil is solid now 
6146 2018-09-02 17:46:28 what is the medium ? is that an oil or ??
6147 2018-09-02 17:46:26 Who care about Larry and Shawn, when Big Pharma, PP, Unions, Oil, Steel, Agricultural, etc are pumping rivers of green into the coffers. Then let's add in foreign companies, or in Hillary Clinton's case Rich Russian Oligarchs and Rich Chinese Govt officials.
6148 2018-09-02 17:46:24 What they have done is increase the debt, increase the number of public workers (paid through taxes) and essentially paid lip service to the pipelines and oil industry. How can you say with a straight face they support oil when they appointed an activist like Tzeporah Berman
6149 2018-09-02 17:46:20 I'd love to have my ass in the sand, instead of a chair, bed, car.  . With the sun on my face, a gorgeous view (hot women, various water, palm trees, waterfalls) oh & some1 to give me a massage. The combo of oil & some sand would feel marvelous right about now. 
6150 2018-09-02 17:46:11 How is this news or relevant, her bikini pics won't change the oil price. Focus!!
6151 2018-09-02 17:46:04 Right! Veterans dying under Obama's watch, OPEC in control of USA oil industry, and children hating their lunches at school and hiding junk food in their lockers! Delusional!
6152 2018-09-02 17:45:56 My young Boul had oil for the first time yesterday and he was like this shit taste like lean 
6153 2018-09-02 17:45:53 Globally, oil consumption continues to rise (although not as fast as natural gas).
6154 2018-09-02 17:45:45 Pete Hegseth gets little recognition for the great Trump and America defender that he is. God bless and protect Pete Hegseth. Same for the Fox and Friends Monday thru Friday crew. I have no tv but I know how active they are via Twitter. These guys are unsung heroes.

6156 2018-09-02 17:45:39 I don't understand why a person of science, such as yourself, would be in favor of a pipeline for oil when we need anything but fossil fuels for the energy sector of any country.

6163 2018-09-02 17:44:30 How fucking much is your oil change and where do you go?!?
6164 2018-09-02 17:44:23 No appreciation at all in my house. I prepared kontonmire stew for supper. Instead of my Aunt to say "The stew is nice", she said "The palm oil is nice"

Im there like "Wow"
6165 2018-09-02 17:44:22 My dad changed my oil and put new windshield wipers on my car all before I woke up this morning
6166 2018-09-02 17:44:04 After Vietnam, US Interests learned "if you can't beat them militarily, destroy them economically."
Venezuela has the largest oil reserves, "just off" US' coast. It's always about oil, money & US supremacy,
The rest is propaganda, and no one falls for propaganda likes Americans.
6167 2018-09-02 17:43:49 Can you analyze $NOG .  If oil continues to rise, it could have a positive effect on it
TY
6168 2018-09-02 17:43:48 Big oil is always trying to kill solar. So many unused rooftops
6169 2018-09-02 17:43:45 The world will continue to demand oil. If Canada doesn’t supply its part, other countries will gladly do it.
6170 2018-09-02 17:43:43 Fair comment. But Wood Mac just forecast peak oil demand by 2036 (Suncor thinks between 2038 and 2048) and now we're all debating the shape of the decline curve. We've begun an energy transition. One day oil won't be oxygen. That was my point.
6171 2018-09-02 17:43:43 I use to use the one with tea tree oil and it was doing justice to my skin.....think it's discontinued now can't seem to find it anywhere
6172 2018-09-02 17:43:33 Yea i love smoking oil out of those bangers. I knew that at least, but everything else i was lost lol. I pray everyday it becomes legal here

6175 2018-09-02 17:43:25 Fact - there are far more jobs in renewable energy without having to jeopardize our children’s future on our only planet than bringing back coal and oil. We were energy independent before the idiot arrived and our safety endangered.
6176 2018-09-02 17:43:18 Interestingly oil is burned more than just personal chemicals. But yes, we should decrease the amount of meat we eat until it can be efficiently lab grown.
6177 2018-09-02 17:43:10 Good luck to all your family Roag. All of my family are invested but I must say I am really enjoying the whole experience.
6178 2018-09-02 17:43:05 1. What I have said is true
2. It’s not only based on my personal experience or opinion
3. Your opinion is also not a wider study!

Funny how a lot of our tax dollars go there, a place where they whine constantly, like kids who do not get everything they want
6185 2018-09-02 17:41:46 Yeah I would think downing that much oil just on its own would be uncomfortable

Oil drilling jobs start at the top and work your way down.
6187 2018-09-02 17:41:29 Go to Gujarat and visit Surat.

There is a sea or river situated near its.

And this river/sea has less water than oil released by ambani and adani.

That is gujrat mode of development by destroying eco system and pouring money to rich one
6188 2018-09-02 17:41:21 Oh man. That sucks. I keep telling my boyfriend to take that CBD oil to help him sleep, but he can’t have a trace of that in his system no matter what. If he’s tested, he’d lose his job. Doesn’t matter if there’s cannabis in it or not.
6189 2018-09-02 17:41:13 Chinese people ehn pls bro I want this clip
6190 2018-09-02 17:40:58 You think he has a little altar/shrine to her hidden somewhere in his man-cave. Like perpetual candles, an oil painting of her, photos, and incense? 
6191 2018-09-02 17:40:56 It was a single sheet of homemade pasta, almost translucent, folded over and over with layers of warm smokie between the soft folds, then lovingly coated with the wild mushroom sauce and a sprinkling of fresh chives and 3 drops of truffle oil...
6192 2018-09-02 17:40:41 I completely forgot about baking soda  i use that to clean my tub. I’m definitely gonna try that with some lavender oil. Let me know if the citric acid works if you get the chance. I’m slowly trying to eliminate everything toxic for allergies
6193 2018-09-02 17:40:36 The lesson for everyone here is to not go by any vehicles' oil life monitor and change that shit every 3-5k miles!
6194 2018-09-02 17:40:29 Excellent hopefully he'll get to meet some of the guys. I'ts great you've as a fam are hooked on this  absolute game changer. My son & daughter are in too along with loads of friends. We're up in Cheshire so need to get organised and visit the site. See you on the other side 
6195 2018-09-02 17:40:25 One justifies the other I suppose? I dont like this whataboutism on either side but it seems leftists have selective memories so pointing out hypocrisy seems fair, sadly

6198 2018-09-02 17:40:04 Taking Keppra and drinking alcohol. Mmmmmmmmmmmm I'm sure there's some sort of interaction there. I think a better idea would be taking CBD oil 1:1, if you want to relax while flying. I remember with GBM, flying is more difficult because of the altitude and the pressure.
6199 2018-09-02 17:40:00 After a year of growing my hair back for a year it’s at a nice length. But it’s not healthy, it’s super dry and brittle gotta get a deep condition & hot oil treatment asap
6200 2018-09-02 17:39:58 oh yes... i like this part "I am sending you grain, new wine and oil, enough to satisfy you fully; never again will i make you an object of scorn to the nations"
6201 2018-09-02 17:39:43 Well if Canada isn't America's friend maybe Canada should shut off your oil imports which is about 70% for a couple of months. Then let's see how you behave
6202 2018-09-02 17:39:42 Due to the oil in our hands
6203 2018-09-02 17:39:34 Covers drilling, economic and environmental impact on Norway, nice “mini oil platform” you can walk around, lots of miniatures showing how big the damn things have got, and so on. Much more even-handed than I’d expected, covers risks and problems. Worth ~2 hrs of your time IMO
6204 2018-09-02 17:39:34 Why Afghanistan? For the Opium, you stupid fucks. Also oil pipeline that runs through it. Opium Poppy's - yes when you break your leg, they give you heroin as painkiller #WakeUp
6205 2018-09-02 17:39:22 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.

Made an essential oil diffuser blend and slept with it last night now I’m back and I’m better
6210 2018-09-02 17:38:47 Well said.  I always thought of Dubya as a useful idiot to members of congress & oil company CEO's, which was pretty bad. But trump is a useful idiot to a hostile foreign government which is a coup d'etat.
6211 2018-09-02 17:38:29 Looks like the oil blooms early this year
6212 2018-09-02 17:38:20 Peak oil son los padres.
6213 2018-09-02 17:38:03 i need to get an oil change but i’m scared to go by myself because i’m a child
6214 2018-09-02 17:37:59 I swear I’m going to pack hot sauce and chili oil next time I’m in Europe
6215 2018-09-02 17:37:58 Lol you think the west cares about your rights??  Open your eyes and see what the west is doing all over the world, Syria, Afghanistan, Palestine, Lybia... 
Is it a coincidence that the US army is present in all oil rich countries waging a war there? Ngwarai vanhu
6216 2018-09-02 17:37:57 “im like hummus and olive oil mayo white”

6220 2018-09-02 17:37:45 Beats logic. Why not refine the crude oil and use it locally. ..talk about misplaced priorities
6221 2018-09-02 17:37:43 Really want to try @ABHcosmetics' Hydrating Face Oil, it sounds amazing
6222 2018-09-02 17:37:42 The problem in kenya is,when world prices of oil are going down,prices of fuel here are the same or going up.
6223 2018-09-02 17:37:42 I don’t hate oil
I don’t like oil 
Olive oil
6224 2018-09-02 17:37:32 "Lord Jesus, fill us with the oil of grace and prayer. Fill us with the  Holy Spirit. Give us the grace to keep our lamps lit, ever ready for  your return. Ever ready to rejoice at the sound of your voice."  
Amen, thank you.

6226 2018-09-02 17:37:26 Great running truck no slips in tranny cold air 4x4 works great tires in great shape 3rd door and tailgate works has oil leak and has rust on underbody don’t have to sell this truck runs and drives strong
6227 2018-09-02 17:37:22 It’s because they’re almost all involved with the oil industry,other car manufacturers, or suppliers, either directly or indirectly. It’s like poor coal miners arguing against solar even thought everyone they know has died of lung cancer.
6228 2018-09-02 17:37:20 aku oily acne prone lebih suka pake cleansing oil, gentle dan emg disaranin dokter pake itu aja, tapi yang emg beneran cleansing oil ya bukan oil ini itu dipake buat cleansing, soalnya kalo cleansing oil yg proper dia bakal berubah tekstur jd kaya sabun pas dibilas pake air
6229 2018-09-02 17:37:18 IVIG reverses the disease and use black seed oil daily
6230 2018-09-02 17:37:11 I think we are seeing the end run of oil based energy. Total waste of the benefits that emerged after worldwide oil industry. By 2050 will be back to clipper ships for majority of cargo.

Seating a McCain, very bad idea if you want this to go away.
6233 2018-09-02 17:37:00 Bought 4 medium Windsor and Newton oil paints and now my chest and bank account hurt  I'm not a fan of this "gotta spend money to make money" thing y'all
6234 2018-09-02 17:36:53 Indian govt is exporting oil at half the price to other countries that Indians are paying (refined #petrol to 15 nations at Rs 34/ltr & #diesel to 29 countries at Rs 37/ltr).

Where are our taxes going?

6235 2018-09-02 17:36:53 I once drank a shot of olive oil because I could
6236 2018-09-02 17:36:52 No it was ciroc honey and red label oil. Coz two bottles
6237 2018-09-02 17:36:47 1/2 cup of baking soda 
half a teaspoon of sage essential oil 
half a teaspoon of lavender oil
Florida water
Rue water
6238 2018-09-02 17:36:44 Why don't oil extractors work as fast as you would logically think they do?
6239 2018-09-02 17:36:41 I just showed you the trend of the drastic plunging of the GDP within such a short time DESPITE the high oil price & having the "best" economist in the world in Ngozi. Tell us the policies that would have reversed it na with extremely low prices & depleted reserves!

6243 2018-09-02 17:36:18 I love any sort of drawing, traditional or digital and manga is definitely a favorite.

6246 2018-09-02 17:36:09 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
6247 2018-09-02 17:36:01 Funny how the US has to show up and spread some democracy in countries with lots of oil.
6248 2018-09-02 17:35:41 I don’t understand why the most obvious posts get so much traffic like someone could say “#selfcare is not rubbing pizza oil on your face” and it would get 1k+ likes and comments like “so profound!” and “I really needed this today thank you:)”
6249 2018-09-02 17:35:38 Ok. Taink u..... But today is Sunday, so how many bottles of anointing oil keeps the doctor away
6250 2018-09-02 17:35:28 I think a real good triangulation arb trade would be short Ruble, short Crude Oil, long Napping Boxes.

You think Alfa Bank would book that Swap?
6251 2018-09-02 17:35:22 Is that worse than peddling snake oil disguised as emu guts?
6252 2018-09-02 17:35:12 When Buhari's regime implemented d TSA, all govt monies was mopped up and moved to CBN, banks became broke and the oil sector was in comatose. The only thing they can think of is charging their customers arbitrarily to survive. Banks lend to real sector to grow the economy.
6253 2018-09-02 17:35:11 All this oil nonsense has to do with 2022 politics.
6254 2018-09-02 17:35:03 You do realize,  oil is a finite resource.  Once it's gone,  it's gone,  whether it takes 50 years or 500 years,  we will eventually run out.  You can't "grow" oil.  So the intelligent thing to do is figure out how we are going to survive without it,  NOW, before we run out.
6255 2018-09-02 17:34:58 Father, pour in the oil and will be in our brother’s broken heart. Thank you for the new day and continue to uphold him in these trying times, in Jesus name, amen
6256 2018-09-02 17:34:47 All we're hearing from you folks is that you'll take Climate Change seriously when you've siphoned off the last drop of gas and dug the last oil sands deposit. All your bluster about jobs and economy sounds like selfish whining so you can ride your big trucks for another year.
6257 2018-09-02 17:34:36 Sounds like you need that rubbing oil more than I do.
6258 2018-09-02 17:33:52 Glad to hear you're out and about. I'm sure plenty of fresh air (with a hint of petrol and oil) will definitely help 
6259 2018-09-02 17:33:46 I’m having such a shitty morning, I couldn’t go back to sleep and sleep in a lil more, then I spilled cooking oil on my clothes and legs, then I bruised my elbow, then got bit by a mosquito on my neck and lastly I spilled coffee on my boobs, smh!!!!!!
6260 2018-09-02 17:33:32 Shehad ya olive oil 
6261 2018-09-02 17:33:18 Naive to think it so easy to secure oil from elsewhere - especially an additional 3.4million barrels per day (an enomorous quantity). China and Europe etc are competitors, and Putin is disincentived to.

American economy depends on oil, will grind to a halt without it.
6262 2018-09-02 17:33:17 Go to @LushLtd ! They have hot oil treatments and I’m currently using one of their hair moisturisers!

6266 2018-09-02 17:32:46 People think Big Oil is the epitome of corporate greed. 

Big Food and Big Pharma have built a profitable cycle. One creates obesity, type 2 diabetics, arteriosclerosis, and the other "treats" the conditions created by the other with expensive drugs. #nutrition
6267 2018-09-02 17:32:46 Now focus on good governance I.e initiatives / planning for;
 » Reduction in poverty ,inflation, un employment ,corruption ,prices of elec ,gas ,oil
» Increase in Tax net, exports
» Good relations with international community
» One govt only; no parallel govt/decisions elsewhere
6268 2018-09-02 17:32:38 Why r u referring only to oil producing countries with ctax? Cld it b that few oil-producing countries have meaningful carbon taxes? Actually, it has worked in Norway, just not enough 2 compensate 4 increased oil production. Revenue neutral ctaxes combined with regs work. See BC.
6269 2018-09-02 17:32:33 my son is going to the site tomorrow with his camera early.
6270 2018-09-02 17:32:26 yes u r right, Ambani was having small cloth shop, Adani was selling eatable oil n malya was running desi DARU shop before 2014 n ALL 3 prosepoures n became billionaire only after MODI became PM in 14.

6272 2018-09-02 17:32:11 They probably use Olive Oil in the chicken though.
6273 2018-09-02 17:31:57 Marinade chicken in spice for 10 minutes.
Baked it at max in a pan filled with olive oil.
When the chicken looks crispy, add lots of butter, when its melted,add garlic/onion and keep going. When eveything is good, turn off heat and drop heavy cream. Serve when done.
6274 2018-09-02 17:31:52 Steel beams don’t melt without controlled demolition! Oprah is actually an eagle wearing a big costume! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
6275 2018-09-02 17:31:51 Oil and Honey liquor bottles. Strange things. Oil, Honey and sharjeel Memon.
6276 2018-09-02 17:31:45 Normal person: just gets an oil change 

Me, literally made of nothing but anxiety: they didn’t actually change your oil. Your car was parked in the exact same spot. They just turned off your sensor and charged you $35. Your car is going to break down on the highway.
6277 2018-09-02 17:31:42 It’s not tar, it’s oil. You have to process it to be turned into tar. Oil is natural, even when trapped in sand. There’s nothing unnatural about ancient, decomposed flora & fauna. Your compost bin would create the same byproduct if it was under pressure for millions of years. 
6278 2018-09-02 17:31:41 No I’m worried vinegar will eat away at the clothes. I add baking soda, chlorine free bleach and a few drops of whatever essential oil I’m feelin.
6279 2018-09-02 17:31:30 PSA NEVER cook with OLIVE OIL. When heated, it turns to trans-fats. You're welcome! 
6280 2018-09-02 17:31:16 an investment cos it's like £40 but lasts ages and really works cos it's got hyaluronic acid in) also I like basic benzoyl peroxide for any spots and vitamin E oil for general moisture/glow 
6281 2018-09-02 17:31:16 Plus America's push for oil production dominance, and Canada is completely forgotten.
6282 2018-09-02 17:31:10 Just remember NO Bailouts for oil or other corporate welfare.

6290 2018-09-02 17:30:20 Can't get over the moment when Muhammad Jam (sitting in the rear of a police mobile) says liquor bottles found in Sharjeel Memon's hospital room contained honey and oil and the uncouth reporter asks "Konsa tel? SAANDAY ka tel thaa?" 
6291 2018-09-02 17:30:18 Ok so if some people want to eat white flour pasta and some unhealthy oil, even when they know it's bad for them, that's fine. That is secondary to the point that animals are suffering every day of their lives, and then are brutally murdered, when it's completely unnecessary.
6292 2018-09-02 17:30:15 We just want the oil sands. You can keep the rest
6293 2018-09-02 17:30:05 potangina wa ko nagbayad ug 600 para pahiran ra ug oil akong lawas yawa
6294 2018-09-02 17:29:56 The oil museum is surprisingly informative :)
6295 2018-09-02 17:29:51 Rates are directly connected to rents. I'll send you more details of how the valuation office calculates the rateable vallue next week.
6296 2018-09-02 17:29:47 Venezuela has oil.
6297 2018-09-02 17:29:34 And the Oil and Gas Industry has gotten NO subsidies and government hand outs, Kinder Morgan just got 4.5 billion for a rusty pipeline.
6298 2018-09-02 17:29:29 yep...one of my better ones. 
6299 2018-09-02 17:29:21 The only good thing that can ever come out of that oil money
6300 2018-09-02 17:29:20 Scania v8.... ideal if poor oil pressure and overheating problems are your thing... and fuel economy and resale value aren’t important to you...
6301 2018-09-02 17:29:13 Oil and beef are yesterdays industries. I hope you find something interesting and rewarding to do.
6302 2018-09-02 17:28:59 Very very true and In the oil companies also
6303 2018-09-02 17:28:56 a coconut based oil thing(not coconut oil tho) from a brand called skin79 (Korean but they sell their stuff on Beautybay) and u like pump a little in your hand and rub it all over your face and wash it off with warm water!

any like simple sea salt/sugar based scrub is incredible
6304 2018-09-02 17:28:35 @QuickLane has an oil change for $19.95
6305 2018-09-02 17:28:34 houny  and oil
6306 2018-09-02 17:28:32 I guess I model Google as being like Standard Oil or MicroSoft when they were in the process of making their competition a non issue.
6307 2018-09-02 17:28:31 Damn would have to be high 30s to low 40s, Military then Oil Exploration (the majority) less than 10 after the Oil Fields!
6308 2018-09-02 17:28:09 As a coach, he’s a great self-promoting snake oil salesman. At Houston, he waited until later in the season to get grossly out coached and outplayed on the road. He’s an arrogant prick with nothing to be arrogant about. Austin is the perfect place for him.
6309 2018-09-02 17:27:46 I found luck with Vaseline on and around my eyes at night! I also had a cream with emu oil that helped a lot
6310 2018-09-02 17:27:35 Question, will Turkana oil monies be able to offset the loans?


6311 2018-09-02 17:27:29 1  a minority of 48% (last poll) for indy is a substantial element that you cannot ignore.
2  thanks, we'll have indyref2 any time you like.
3  we don't blame the English.  we blame Westminster
4  Scotland subsidises England, not the other way round. (look where the oil is)
6312 2018-09-02 17:27:16 InfoChip's #RFID products are ideal for industries like oil & gas, rigging, lifting, mining, aerospace, construction, & rental companies.
6313 2018-09-02 17:27:15 Lanny hasn't figured out none of these clowns investigate anymore. They dont even verify info with corroboration, as evidenced here. Rip and paste is SOP and can be done from comfort of home.
6314 2018-09-02 17:27:11 I have heard of people mixing perfume w/ scented lotion, perfume w/ scented oil and scented oils w/ lotion but I just heard about people mixing TWO perfume scents and now I’m like...  why tho?
6315 2018-09-02 17:27:07 @Walmart why is it always a 3 hour wait to get an oil change? Tired of them any way. Looks like I ll take my business elsewhere.
6316 2018-09-02 17:26:57 Getting ready to oil her up!
6317 2018-09-02 17:26:56 Energy sources?Oil, coal, nuclear, hydroelectric,wind, solar. The first 2 are sources of carbon emissions  ( though not like they used to be.) Dams hurt fish. Nuclear?The snowflakes are afraid of that. 2 fatal accidents since 1945. Wind and solar are inadequate. So now what?
6318 2018-09-02 17:26:52 เริ่มติดไพ่ละ
6319 2018-09-02 17:26:20 Fun fact of the day... oil company in Houston installed solar farm to power refinery. File that under "ironic."
6320 2018-09-02 17:26:13 Andrew Scheer just called oil the most environmentally friendly energy source. Someone help me pick up my jaw from the floor.
6321 2018-09-02 17:26:05 Mason apparently can't figure out that Scheer was comparing the relative "cleanliness" of Canadian oil vs other brands.
6322 2018-09-02 17:25:57 Rates aren't connected to rents, they are set via the Valuations Office which was last reviewed in 2017?? . It's an assessment of usable space, type of business and then a calc of the pence to give you your RV and then Rates Payable. And it's blinking complex
6323 2018-09-02 17:25:55 I just used normal shampoo and conditioner but at the weekends used an oil based mask.
6324 2018-09-02 17:25:39 Woke up early to get my oil changed. Now I get to enjoy pot and coffee
6325 2018-09-02 17:25:39 I agree it’s a complicated issue but in all honesty no one is going to extract oil under stricter conditions than Canadians. Until such time as we don’t require as much we should be using our own resources
6326 2018-09-02 17:25:38 In the US we criminalize any attempt to save our water from being polluted. In the US we allow oil companies to use a network of third parties to hire its oil field workers to avoid responsibility when they get killed on the job.
6327 2018-09-02 17:25:21 Repeating things doesn't make them true. It's fine for this to be your opinion but if it isn't based on a wider study and it conflicts with my opinion then it's pointless continuing the discussion on this topic.
6328 2018-09-02 17:25:19 I’m pretty sure there’s a (Portuguese?) recipe for soup that calls for 2kilos of the garlicky stuff. And a couple of litres of olive oil. Although having just thought that, I accept I’m probably exaggerating the essence of it.
6329 2018-09-02 17:25:11 Oil
6330 2018-09-02 17:25:03 Innisfree oil tint

6332 2018-09-02 17:24:45 Recommend me body oil scents from @KrazyEssentials because I can’t use the dulce de leche one . Help a sis out.
6333 2018-09-02 17:24:45 Very good

6335 2018-09-02 17:24:40 The expanding of our own industry helps more than it hurts. The continued reliance on foreign oil is not only bad for our economy but it benefits countries with less than stellar human rights records. The idea of giving money to Saudi Arabia is not appealing
6336 2018-09-02 17:24:28 So when are you shutting down the oil tankers that are currently in your waters?
6337 2018-09-02 17:24:14 Baby oil
6338 2018-09-02 17:23:58 If the market is really decontrolled then why the retail fuel price graph didn’t turn southward when the crude oil price dipped from $100 per barrel to $43 per barrel in 2016 and $51 per barrel in 2017?
6339 2018-09-02 17:23:53 Asia could get your oil now, they don't need it, and they don't really have enough of the proper refineries to do anything with it even if they did want it. It's a grift man, that's what I've been telling you. It's a grift for the good of a few banks, and a Texas oil company
6340 2018-09-02 17:23:44 witch culture is when u lose ur moonstone but then u remember it's in the fridge with ur empath oil
6341 2018-09-02 17:23:44 New tires. New air filter. Alignment. Oil change. Brake light. Registration. Red light camera ticket. And a wash. 

Bro. This car is killing me. 
6342 2018-09-02 17:23:38 as soon as we "take over" big pharma, oil & gas, and the insurance industry.

6345 2018-09-02 17:23:22 Also Canada can't get their oil exported without pipelines, and everyone is against new projects.
6346 2018-09-02 17:22:53 I don't agree with anything you've said here. It doesn't even make sense as rates are connected to rents.
6347 2018-09-02 17:22:47 Please stop trying to impose your ideology and respect sovereignty. Corruption is mitigated with jobs and “rule of law”. CICIG’s lawfare hinders both. No aid but fair trade.  economy: mining, steel, oil, chemicals, paper hydropower, wich you fund to boycott in Why?
6348 2018-09-02 17:22:47 Asbestos is something that is proven to cause serious health problems.

The comparison of selling that to selling oil is pretty shallow minded.

The entire world functions on fossil fuels
6349 2018-09-02 17:22:35 I def worked hard, burned the midnight oil to rise to the occasion here and there. But then, I’d take a day. Turn it off. Take the 3 day weekend. Agree to disagree, I don’t think we’re designed to go go go.
6350 2018-09-02 17:22:21 I live in SEC country for a while man does it suck during football season, now outside the pac in the oil patch where it is all SEC, OSU, pac, it almost turned into a fist fight at wild wings last night lol
6351 2018-09-02 17:22:19 My morning routine? First, I meditate, journal, and pray. Then I bathe in coconut milk and rose petals and do severable charitable deeds. After, I light candles and feast on a dish of bee pollen. Next? Oil pulling, ear candling, and a face mask. Then it’s 10pm and I MUST sleep!
6352 2018-09-02 17:22:13 Yes, the industrial seed oil industry (previously solely the soap industry) had a very vested interest at the same time. These two together created "the perfect storm".
6353 2018-09-02 17:22:06 this facial oil i been using feels and smell so good
6354 2018-09-02 17:22:04 Season with the pan, add this is set, but two of oil with a pinch of hot water and add the pan.
6355 2018-09-02 17:21:53 Because when oil is burned it contributes to climate change.
6356 2018-09-02 17:21:48 Thanks! We'll get that updated. You can use any cooking oil that you like!
6357 2018-09-02 17:21:34 Tea spoon of coconut oil with 2 drops of tea tree oil mixed together does the trick  Good luck gorgeous and I hope I am of some help to you xXx
6358 2018-09-02 17:21:27 His car runs on fairy dust lubricated with peanut butter. Or ethically produced Saudi and Venezuelan oil?
6359 2018-09-02 17:21:17 If you have non virgin oil ill be happy to try it...
6360 2018-09-02 17:20:46 You could make that case. If so, most were saying Happ was a better choice. I can't fault them. Even looking at it now, they have 4 starters leaking major oil. One wouldn't have been enough.
6361 2018-09-02 17:20:35 1. If a tenant’s rent was increased prior to the financial crash there is a very high probability that they can get a reduction.
2. LL want a tenant to succeed.
3. LL do not want empty shops
6362 2018-09-02 17:20:32 This is such a bad idea. Only oil and gas interests $$$ support it. SAVE OUR PLANET, get off FILTHY FOSSIL FUELS, go RENEWABLES!
6363 2018-09-02 17:20:31 That brand hehe mas mura daw Bio Oil sa pinas! Hehehe! Effective sya mag even out ng skin color. Pati stretch marks ko napabilis magfade 
6364 2018-09-02 17:20:22 coconut  oil
6365 2018-09-02 17:20:19 Cuz Trump is at fault for the oil screwup in Canada...ok
6366 2018-09-02 17:20:12 Jiffy Lube: Get an oil change for only $29.99!**

**does not include the 17 additional things we will inform you are wrong with your car (none of which you’ll understand) plus a nice visual demo of your air filters to scare you
6367 2018-09-02 17:20:07 No, gas prices will actually go up in B.C. B.C. has no use for heavy oil. Right now, it costs about $2.50 a barrel. After the pipeline is completed: estimated to be $5.90 a barrel.
6368 2018-09-02 17:19:59 You guys I just calculated the math. And our oil reserves could be depleted in 39 years. Let that sink in.
6369 2018-09-02 17:19:50 Will it make any difference to climate change if Canada reduces there carbon footprint to nil?  Will the world use less oil if Canada keeps all theirs in the ground?
6370 2018-09-02 17:19:50 I’m literally an oil rig
6371 2018-09-02 17:19:32 In what way does selling oil damage our future? 

The post construction impact is small
6372 2018-09-02 17:19:29 2 of 2. Broken & not fit for the 21st century.Again the big E players are showing this to governments. It should be a proportion of rent paid, because your landlord could never be your Rates landlord & your Rent landlord wld THEN be more aware of pricing themselves out of market
6373 2018-09-02 17:19:22 Like I said before, the argument is not that we stop making everything from oil yesterday. The argument is not to expand the oil and gas sector while investing more heavily in alternatives.
6374 2018-09-02 17:19:21 Lady next to me on the train told me my chicken nuggets smell like oil 
I miss my car
6375 2018-09-02 17:19:20 The canola oil industry.
6376 2018-09-02 17:19:13 I started using beard oil yesterday
6377 2018-09-02 17:19:02 oh!イル
6378 2018-09-02 17:18:43 Could be more serious than low oil but it could also be that simple too. Try the easiest fixes first. Life can suck. But that sucking is relative. And there is usually good stuff around too if you can let it in and focus on it. Meanwhile it's one foot in front of the other.
6379 2018-09-02 17:18:26 Where can i get coconut oil ladies
6380 2018-09-02 17:18:14 I'm still frustrated with "evoo"
I cook a lot; it's just olive oil ....
6381 2018-09-02 17:18:06 Rebuild the railway for grain and a pipeline for oil.  Can't happen soon enough. Export products and watch BC bitch about it.

howdy. i'm the sheriff of oil drum
6383 2018-09-02 17:18:01 You brought back a memory.  I had a boyfriend who used this.  The thing is, he chewed gum like a nodding donkey pumping out oil, so he had to go.
6384 2018-09-02 17:17:53 71,000 miles and well out of warranty; was SUPER bummed when I recently had to pay $1.68 for a new key fob battery.  Brings avg maintenance cost up to 42 cents per year so far.  No gas, no oil changes, and still look forward to putting the Go pedal down every day.
6385 2018-09-02 17:17:50 No oil is superior. Green jobs are superior to oil jobs though.
6386 2018-09-02 17:17:39 Since how many years the mentions two so called external factors are affecting oil price hike? Especially Rs v $.. from 2-3 yrs it's 4-5 Rs more from 65 to  now 71.. but oil price from 70+ to 85+.. Don't try to explain  Congress logic.
6387 2018-09-02 17:17:35 Ahhhhh I’m SO geeked  I just found all my paint brushes and water colors and oil pastels and colored pencils and my sketch books   #happylilnerd
6388 2018-09-02 17:17:13 Followed by oil body massage
6389 2018-09-02 17:17:04 We can stop their cheap oil from Canada.
6390 2018-09-02 17:16:53 Yes the sauce be like oil. It’s gross.
6391 2018-09-02 17:16:52 Your outrage about spending would be better appreciated if we weren’t funding POTUS golf outings.
6392 2018-09-02 17:16:50 1 of 2 This is one of the biggest 'falsehoods' in #SME / #SmallBiz , why because all of us have to pay rent. If the landlords didn't exist there would be no #SmallBusiness  The problem is #business rates. Taxing a biz on what it does, where it does it etc is NUTS.. The system is.
6393 2018-09-02 17:16:37 Shit weighs a ton, water your garden my nigga and stunt
Tell these black kids they could be who they are
Dye your hair blue, shit, I'll do it too
Look, I smell like Chanel
I never mall grip with my manicured nails
I coconut oil the skin
6394 2018-09-02 17:16:29 I don’t agree with headline or all conclusions but the point is generically accurate imo. Frack boom been great for consumers and industry executives. Not so great for folks funding the supply increases.   We are at $70 and still some oil co’s going belly up.
6395 2018-09-02 17:16:26 Refining oil does not reduce the bulk of the commodity it only adds to the problem of keeping everything separate. The industry does things for a reason and efficiently
6396 2018-09-02 17:16:15 Wait, I thought they used peanut oil? With the nuggets anyway.

WHAT BUHARI & HIS NORTHERN OLIGARCHY HAVE STOLEN FROM NIGERIA, MAINLY SOUTHERN OIL FOR THE NORTH NO PRESIDENT SINCE INDEPENDENCE HAS STOLEN & THIS WAS DONE UNDER 3 YEARS & PRETENSE OF INTEGRITY WITH ACTIVE SUPPORT OF TINUBU AND OSINBAJO
6399 2018-09-02 17:15:42 I use olive oil sorry
6400 2018-09-02 17:15:17 I used to like cod liver oil and malt, tasted like toffee 
6401 2018-09-02 17:15:13 The Bush Family made billions of dollars on oil dating back to 1930. You also made hundreds of thousands while at Harken energy in a deal that reeks of insider trading & accounting fraud that you claim to oppose. Your a hypocrite liar.
6402 2018-09-02 17:14:59 The hard working men and women that work in the oil and gas industry,  that's who ! 
Nothing wrong with that !
6403 2018-09-02 17:14:40 Ive got oily skin already im scared of coconut oil but thanks
6404 2018-09-02 17:14:37 When the trains are full of oil nothing else gets shipped over the tracks, so yes it can have an impact
6405 2018-09-02 17:14:28 น้องรูปนี้เหมือนพี่มาร์คมากเลยค่ะม๊า
6406 2018-09-02 17:14:20 Mom brain is great.
:) It's the crazy pregnancy brain that has us putting the milk in the pantry and the veggie oil in the fridge.
6407 2018-09-02 17:14:17 I just watched my coworker try to twist an oil dipstick and get mad when it didn’t come off #TheMoreYouKnow
6408 2018-09-02 17:14:03 just bought my Indy ticket I hope Lucas Oil Stadium is ready for @ycurmidnights and I
6409 2018-09-02 17:14:01 oil change is an exception.

6411 2018-09-02 17:13:45 Not these days...Start planning the future now or there is no future..as in Climate Change...Global Warming..Oil going dry...etc..
6412 2018-09-02 17:13:38 If you think that palm oil is not vegan then we don't disagree at all 
6413 2018-09-02 17:13:26 Coconut oil is actually amazing!
6414 2018-09-02 17:13:19 ｧﾞｧﾞ。。。
6415 2018-09-02 17:12:57 used it at nights to go fishing after a good dose of honey and oil.
6416 2018-09-02 17:12:47 Bro, Oil accounts for 92-95% of our foreign export earnings. However, our Mineral and Mining act 2007 has established grounds where natural resources are found belongs to the fed govt & not the State

A state IGR covers others exclusive of this & FAA
6417 2018-09-02 17:12:34 I'm not criticising you for your positive comment about landlords. I'm trying to clarify that the issue has never been intended to be about whether landlords are good or bad.
6418 2018-09-02 17:12:21 CBD oil, Cannabidiol
6419 2018-09-02 17:12:19 The future trends towards what is better. Is it better that cars run of electricty or oil? Is it better that Silicon Valley remains the innovation center of the world or not? It takes some kind of monopoly force to keep things in a way that is worse long term.
6420 2018-09-02 17:12:19 Eliminating PO should be the end goal of course, I’m just not going to argue with someone about the status of their veganism because they still consume vegan products made with palm oil. 

I’d rather talk to nonvegans about how to go vegan.
6421 2018-09-02 17:12:18 Bulletproof Coffee with Butter AND Ghee, sometimes an egg yolk, no MCT oil. Other times it's  three eggs 
6422 2018-09-02 17:12:05 Pake yang cleansing oil jangan sembarangan oil. Kalo cleansing oil dia bikin larut makeup sama kotoran jadi ndak perlu kapas buat angkat.
6423 2018-09-02 17:12:04 News Flash: 1st nations people enjoy high paying jobs & also consume oil products

6427 2018-09-02 17:11:48 OK. A small town has very low empty #shops & high rents.The #town next to it has low rents & high number of empty shops, so more startups go there & are encouraged to do so by #BIDS ,LA etc. 1 yr one all gone. Always said some #HIghstreet will survive & some will not. Let them go
6428 2018-09-02 17:11:40 I’m aware this is where disagree. 

Except you and I both agree on the status of palm oil not being vegan but I’m not into policing someone’s veganism bc of it because they’re already doing so much already.
6429 2018-09-02 17:11:40 I'm so rude on that oil 
6430 2018-09-02 17:11:28 Which economist? Can't you interpret the trend yourself? GDP Q4 2014 was 5.9%. Q1 2015 dropped drastically to 3.8%! Q2 2015 dropped to 2.35%! All this DESPITE a high oil price! What "policies" would have taken it higher with oil prices going as low as $29/ barrel in 6 months?
6431 2018-09-02 17:11:21 Some say that applying oil in your navel will do you good. How far this is true
6432 2018-09-02 17:11:16 No mention of the expansion in oil sands production increasing CO2. More CO2=more heat/more acidic oceans. It's that simple. Every society will have to reduce their CO2 footprint. The past summer was a small taste of what is coming. We have failed to act for far too long.
6433 2018-09-02 17:10:58 And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil. 2 Kings 4:2 #ThanksgivingService @rccgcornerstone
6434 2018-09-02 17:10:27 Fracking is the way most oil will be produced in the United States for the foreseeable future. Most states are not buying into the environmental arguments made to date to ban it because they are irrational.
6435 2018-09-02 17:10:25 If you get earaches then a drop of Tea tree oil should do the trick
6436 2018-09-02 17:10:23 洗濯物干しました
6437 2018-09-02 17:10:20 Pleas plant fruit trees to increase fruit production...can plant palm oil trees , since it is called black gold...
6438 2018-09-02 17:10:14 早く来世にかけたい
6439 2018-09-02 17:10:10 I dont know perc of oil used for plastics but gas demand isnt crazy elastic so we'd expect net reductions, right?
6440 2018-09-02 17:10:03 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
6441 2018-09-02 17:09:53 Sorry for adding a positive comment. Just adding my experience of landlords.
6442 2018-09-02 17:09:48 受け入れましょう…
6443 2018-09-02 17:09:33 Indeed, mine got worst when I came to Alabama. I had to get cream and oil from the doctors
6444 2018-09-02 17:09:23 I'd be willing to bet their initial reaction to you is disbelief.  I'm glad you are bringing some REALITY into their worlds.  Another valid point: if we were to run out of oil, we'd have other very viable options.  If we run out of water.....? Not so much.
6445 2018-09-02 17:09:07 Yoh the responses. Oil. Butter. 
6446 2018-09-02 17:09:04 Not really. Was just par for the course, really
6447 2018-09-02 17:09:00 There is a car. But the car has a faulty oil line. So the engine won’t start. Ergo the car is now a bicycle. That’s how your incredibly wasteful stupidity sounds. Infertile women are. Women. This does not mean male people are women.
6448 2018-09-02 17:08:58 don’t forget about the shea moisture jamaican black castor oil one too! if you haven’t tried it already
6449 2018-09-02 17:08:54 あっ行ってたんだ～
6450 2018-09-02 17:08:54 What does beard oil even do?
6451 2018-09-02 17:08:48 Believe it or not my dad used simple salt and pepper. Sometimes he'll use Montreal steak spice too, but usually it's just salt and freshly ground black pepper. He includes extra virgin olive oil but that's mostly to prevent it from sticking. I think he uses butter too

6453 2018-09-02 17:08:37 Waiting for ur comments on honey n oil ...
6454 2018-09-02 17:08:36 The US model has always been more leveraged than ours mainly due to the better access to equity capital there. 

I can’t comment on the differential,  but if there were no fracking oil would be closer to $200 than $50.
6455 2018-09-02 17:08:34 Aku sih ga pake cleansing oil,

6456 2018-09-02 17:08:34 Shows you how easy Pep has it City with oil rich cash when Mancini and Pellegrini went there and won titles - look at Pellegrini now and Mancini has done fuck all for years
6457 2018-09-02 17:08:30 Mint oil chases mice away! Who knew? Off to buy some more (and a new frying pan to replace the one I used to beat the shit out of a particularly aggressive mouse with last week). Added bonus, helps the house smell minty fresh.
6458 2018-09-02 17:08:30 Lol yes the “other” sources.They have been looking for other sources since the ‘70’s when our “expert” scientists had predicted an ice age caused by burning fossil fuel.Or a global famine due to population growth or running out of oil. Someday, i agree there will be other sources
6459 2018-09-02 17:08:25 Igbo man with Igbo sense. All ur concern is to take control of oil and even further enslave the Nigeria deltans.
6460 2018-09-02 17:08:21 Politicians regularly criticize banking, oil and gas, insurance, pharmaceuticals, technology, airlines, lawyers, education, police, gun manufacturing, pro sports, etc. No reason journalism be off limits, especially when it's so often unprofessional and lacking.
6461 2018-09-02 17:08:18 "Here, hold this pot of boiling oil".
6462 2018-09-02 17:08:13 I used veg oil as a teenager. I look 65 now though and I’m 42 :)
6463 2018-09-02 17:08:09 My comments were not about whether a landlord is a good person or not. It's about the affect of properties being owned by people who don't trade from them and the consequences for our high streets of ever increasing rents prior to the financial crash.
6464 2018-09-02 17:08:04 本当に楽しかった また会いましょうね
6465 2018-09-02 17:07:53 I need a oil change
6466 2018-09-02 17:07:42 I get headaches with cbd oil that super sweet
6467 2018-09-02 17:07:36 Oil tranported by rail or truck significantly increases environmental impact and makes our oil even les competitive since transportation costs are higher.
6468 2018-09-02 17:07:30 One year I gotta get back there for this race. Or maybe just not go back to Oz after @KnoxvilleNats hmmm

6471 2018-09-02 17:07:21 There’s no Ba’ath state in #syria otherwise #syria would have different political positions toward iraq/Iran war as an example. There’s Mafia deep state that want the oil & gas in Der al Zour area & want to get the “farm” back.
6472 2018-09-02 17:07:20 @MeghanMcCain Meghan, I know you are in pain now, my dad, long gone, was in the waters of pearl harbor for 3 days, covered with oil and debris, when they found him...please think of running for president, we need you to carry on!!!!!
6473 2018-09-02 17:07:18 This should not be an issue but if this is highlighted so much, then CJP could be the witness himself by smelling the bottles. Anyhow, if such bottles filled with honey and oil found from a common man, what could be the rex of Police and CJP?
6474 2018-09-02 17:07:12 Peak oil was a couple years ago, I think.
6475 2018-09-02 17:07:10 Sir  wiil not the  margin  money  calls for  oil importing firms continuosly increase if INR depreciates like this? Remember how many exporters had lost their hedge during US financial crisis because INR appreciated sharply.
6476 2018-09-02 17:07:03 @jackryanamazon @johnkrasinski not my oil change and clogged gutters, thats for sure!
6477 2018-09-02 17:06:54 See the difference of crude oil prices also.

6479 2018-09-02 17:06:45 Electric, by far. Supply chain of oil is horrible. 5 times more energy efficient and power available from most walls.
6480 2018-09-02 17:06:37 Very aggressive
6481 2018-09-02 17:06:34 Utter nonsense, for a start Snp don't get to use any media, that's the Tories. Secondly, Scotland could be independent Without oil, not the basis but a bonus. Thirdly, salivating over Gers figures like a tramp eating chips to prove your cringingly embarrassing view is not unique.
6482 2018-09-02 17:06:13 I'm actually wearing it outside too
Granted it's because I have coconut oil in my hair lol
6483 2018-09-02 17:06:08 Yeah it encourages hair growth. You can just dilute it a bit with another oil (I don’t bother) and heat it up first then rub it through your hair and leave it for like 3 hours. It’s good for facial hair and I use it when I get a bad haircut too ahaha
6484 2018-09-02 17:05:59 No... Don't even do anything just trow the whole yam inside pot of hot oil... Not even water....
6485 2018-09-02 17:05:59 A rapist, a Muslim and a oil mogul!
6486 2018-09-02 17:05:41 헐 저 옷 머지...갖고싶다
6487 2018-09-02 17:05:39 With or without oil,  we will survive with selfless leaders  not looters like GEJ  etal
6488 2018-09-02 17:05:36 Sachin bhai UPA also does not have a very good track record on oil when in power.
6489 2018-09-02 17:05:35 Mango is oil mixed with the shea good enough for me
6490 2018-09-02 17:05:28 also use peanut oil because your god damn sheep.

6493 2018-09-02 17:05:14 Due to Shahid Abbasi’s effort drilling companies came to Pakistan. They found oil reserves. Pti is dancing Imran Khan came nd we found petrol in one week.
6494 2018-09-02 17:04:46 Just to be clear I'm not in arrears and don't need to talk to my landlord. So you haven't read any reports that talk about what most leases are like now? You are basing your statements on personal experience?
6495 2018-09-02 17:04:39 #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta Now that there is possibility of Matatu Strike tomorrow, How much is KRA to loose? Offices won't have staff, Perishable goods from the farms will go to waste, Big Loss of revenue, Just because of 16% V.A.T while Tullow Oil exports our crude oil!! Smh!!
6496 2018-09-02 17:04:37 You can ask South Sudan how are fairing with their oil after their secession from Sudan. It is not always rosy as think. Don't be deceived, oil is d reason for our backwardness.
6497 2018-09-02 17:04:31 You've swallowed the MMT snake oil. In this context, it is irrelevant. You cannot create money in excess of productive capacity, and if your workforce declines so does your productive capacity. Also, go and find out what "dependency ratio" means.
6498 2018-09-02 17:04:17 しお…
6499 2018-09-02 17:04:05 Going to use this twitter to promote my organic home made oil :)
6500 2018-09-02 17:04:05 Just as easy to make my own. In order to avoid overpowering olive oil taste I use neutral avocado oil
6501 2018-09-02 17:04:04 Clearly the oil and energy companies need to be nationalized as well, in order to insure fairness too, right?
6502 2018-09-02 17:03:44 You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it
6503 2018-09-02 17:03:26 I haven't done this with a braid, but with the large bag of cleaned cloves from Costco. Also roasted a bunch and jarred it with olive oil.
Love using the infused oil in things : )
6504 2018-09-02 17:03:25 My son had discovered the coconut oil
6505 2018-09-02 17:03:14 It's very simple but delicious! Fry some mustard seeds, dried red chillies, hing and onion in some oil, add salt. Once onions are done, add tamarind water/ paste, jaggery, rasam powder. Boil well and it's ready! I like this slightly tangy and spicy. Goes well with pongal.
6506 2018-09-02 17:03:02 Do you know how many OIL companies filed for bankruptcy?
6507 2018-09-02 17:03:00 We have a brilliant, decent, fair landlord who also pops in and says hello and sometimes even gives us business. Most definitely, not all landlords are greedy and unreasonable. Surely we are not just lucky? Or is it because we don't live in a city?
6508 2018-09-02 17:02:32 When in doubt, cook. Chicken thighs baking in an iron skillet. Don't care if it's early, it smells amazing. (Onion, garlic, herbs de provence, salt, avocado oil to not stick.)
6509 2018-09-02 17:02:18 I think high rents have been a significant factor in the demise of the High Street, as have absentee landlords who don't look after property I will explain more in a blog as it is difficult to give the full picture here and I think you are inferring things that I'm not implying.
6510 2018-09-02 17:02:17 He came back in after looking at my car and I just started apologizing and saying how embarrassed I was that I was 23K miles past an oil change and he was like what are you talking about everything is in perfect condition....I was like oooooohhhkay....??
6511 2018-09-02 17:02:03 Well teams file these all the time, it's just usually the top 3 teams on each other. 

Last year RedBull filed one on Mercedes when the whole "oil burning" thing came up and Mercedes just filed one on Ferrari the week before the summer break.
6512 2018-09-02 17:01:59 If we build a pipeline from Alberta to the refineries in the east we could reduce the amount of oil imported
6513 2018-09-02 17:01:51 Oil prices sir ???
6514 2018-09-02 17:01:51 Foreign intervention? Were we invaded? I thought we were discussing the bogus concept of "ethical oil."
6515 2018-09-02 17:01:49 

Shehad &amp; Oil tbahh-day.

6518 2018-09-02 17:01:26 As if Trump was ever gonna come out of Syria anyway! 
There'll be a US presence in Syria for decades to come just as there has been in Iraq & Afghanistan! It's not a coincidence that most of Syria's oil & gas fields are right where the US has set up shop & occupied!
6519 2018-09-02 17:01:25 This gaslighting will reduce our dependence on coal and foreign oil deposits
6520 2018-09-02 17:01:17 saying that someone isn’t vegan bc they’re still consuming palm oil imo is too restrictive, for lack of a better word, and only makes it more difficult for people to become vegan.

At least until products are made w/out PO or sustainable collection of it
6521 2018-09-02 17:01:09 Meh I cook with coconut oil everyday. I ain't worried about it.
6522 2018-09-02 17:00:39 though not going in much details Iran is one of main exporter of crude oil and what we export 
6523 2018-09-02 17:00:39 Yes! Look up skate liver oil and also things like cilantro as they can reverse the calcification of the pineal gland. Also don’t use fluoridated toothpaste.

6525 2018-09-02 17:00:24 I made it up really, but peeled and cut into fingers, dipped in an egg wash with salt, pepper, garlic and oregano, then covered in Parmesan and breadcrumbs before shallow frying in butter and oil. Tongs v handy for turning - let me know if you try them!
6526 2018-09-02 17:00:24 You seriously can’t dismiss the Iran coup and oil crisis Carter caused? We’re still fighting Iran and we’re still buying oil from the Middle East. That’s a forty year wrecking ball!!! At least @realDonaldTrump is undoing Obama’s policies a little at a time.
6527 2018-09-02 17:00:21 おーまだ起きてたのかー作業か？無理するなよ？
6528 2018-09-02 17:00:20 No, it means that we should avoid palm oil whenever it is practical and possible. Just like dairy and eggs. And we should pressure vegan brands not to use palm oil.
6529 2018-09-02 17:00:09  give it up mate, sell your snake oil to someone interested in buying
6530 2018-09-02 17:00:02 Oil money can't buy passion
6531 2018-09-02 16:59:52 for when i Could Not focus at all, i forced myself to sit in one spot by removing my phone away from me and making a home pedicure bucket with really any oil (coconut, olive, Vitamin E, etc) so that i couldn't leave my desk without a thorough wipe down

Otto Wagner Kosterlitz
Oil, synthetic polymer paint on paper
6533 2018-09-02 16:59:33 Like eggs and oil ? Lol
6534 2018-09-02 16:59:32 People that say Scandinavian countries do well because of socialism.... NO. They do well partly because they profit from their oil reserves. Disappointing that Canada is too pc to see that.
6535 2018-09-02 16:59:31 Why in the world are you pushing this? You're anti-environment? Just love the smell of petroleum products in the morning? Why is this still showing up on my timeline?

Do you seriously think through how this looks for the oil & gas industry? It's embarassing.
6536 2018-09-02 16:59:24 No it isn't Greg. The average synthetic oil change for a luxury car is around $90, $150 if you're dumb enough to take it to the dealer. It's also free in many luxury models as part of the warranty.
6537 2018-09-02 16:59:14 릿시님 사랑해오
6538 2018-09-02 16:58:59 Relevent fact... none of those activities affect other parts of the country. Alberta is welcome to produce as much oil as they'd like. But transporting it though other provinces means that they need to actually show respect & due process to the other provinces that are affected.
6539 2018-09-02 16:58:48 How long till we have a police force. How long till we have an army and no more militias. How long till we have even decent healthcare. How long till our oil exports can go from the measly 700 thousand barells its at to 15 million barrels.
6540 2018-09-02 16:58:33 I’m saying I think it’s okay for vegans to consume products with palm oil until they’re able to make changes and cut it out of their life. But that takes more adjustments and I don’t expect new vegans to cut out PO especially when the vegan community is clearly so divided on it
6541 2018-09-02 16:58:22 A great evening, I couldn’t seem to find the bread and oil tho.
6542 2018-09-02 16:58:14 Ssshhh, don't tell him US imports over 55% of their oil and that Canada is the #1 import - without oil, american economy would grind to a halt.
6543 2018-09-02 16:58:10 Okay, sorry about the swearing lol! But you did pretty much blame the state of the High Street on greedy landlords!
6544 2018-09-02 16:58:08 Will not take that many people to build the oil line. Could build a refinery from scratch with that much  man power. Remember pipe line work is only short term employment.
6545 2018-09-02 16:57:59 He may have been a brilliant man but he certainly was not a brilliant PM.  He had no financial sense.  

I am sure federal judges are brilliant but they don't give a s... about working Canadians.

Are you prepared to give up you job to an unemployed oil worker?
6546 2018-09-02 16:57:54 i put tea tree oil on everything

6549 2018-09-02 16:57:35 hey fuck nuggets theres no such thing as climate change and oil is good not "evil" electric
6550 2018-09-02 16:57:32 Fry on cast iron with coconut oil finish in the oven at 400 for 20-30 mins. The skins is crispy and the meat is juicy/oil-y.
6551 2018-09-02 16:57:31 Oil
6552 2018-09-02 16:57:29 Hits really close to a terminal on this game, the US was at DEFCON 3 in January of 2077 and the US was completely destroyed for oil.
6553 2018-09-02 16:57:18 right. But I think you’re forgetting an important part of the definition which says “seeks to exclude harm as far as practical and possible” 

avoiding palm oil would make some several vegan alternatives suddenly not vegan which makes it harder for some to be vegan.
6554 2018-09-02 16:57:14 He's f**ked if @jeremycorbyn strikes oil in his veg patch. WMDS in the greenhouse I'd say..#ToriesOut all shades of tory out ffs
6555 2018-09-02 16:57:08 会えないよ
6556 2018-09-02 16:57:07 I’m not sure how it’s possible but I just took my car in for an oil change after 2 years and 23,000 miles past when I was due for one and the guy said my car was in perfect condition and my oil level was good????????? I’m highly confused
6557 2018-09-02 16:57:01 Works carried out at new build property. Johnstones Danish Oil used to ‘feed’ the timber
6558 2018-09-02 16:56:45 Nah but really go find some oregano oil and put it in water hold your nose and drink it . I promise it works in like 2 seconds
6559 2018-09-02 16:56:44 Now to find a suit to slide into after me olive-coco oil bath ....
6560 2018-09-02 16:56:26 Just thinking about the smell of PB makes my nose twinge. Maybe you should make an advent calendar out of it. Like every day do something new like seafoam, mystery oil, trans fluid, kerosene, etc. :)
6561 2018-09-02 16:56:22 very easy: fry bacon, remove, chop into pieces, remove some grease, fry garlic and ham steak in the remaining grease, maybe some chopped onion, toss in kimchi after ham is crispy, then add cooked rice, kochujang, a little sesame oil. Top with fried egg, scallion, soy sauce.
6562 2018-09-02 16:56:17 Honey or olive oil k baaray ma koi tweet nh aya abh tk hahaha lol double standard media consultant 
6563 2018-09-02 16:56:04 But what about the oil, the oil?
6564 2018-09-02 16:55:55 All those going to Arab countries to share in d oil wealth go there through proper job recruitment channels unlike shameless Muslim refugees that r invading Europe w/a begging bowl & being a burden on d welfare system of host countries trying to accommodate them out of compassion
6565 2018-09-02 16:55:23 Seems to me it's to control Russian oil too. They're expanding and OPEC has no control over them.
6566 2018-09-02 16:55:22 Just a little salt and pepper and olive oil.
6567 2018-09-02 16:55:19 One state that can't afford it partners with other states that can't afford it and you end up with his Confederation of States that can't afford it. Standard lib plan
6568 2018-09-02 16:55:14 I've never eaten it myself.

Take a spoonful of cold Coca-Cola syrup.  Drop into batter; then drop into hot oil until the batter is cooked.
6569 2018-09-02 16:55:14 15 yrs of being a commercial LL - my shop closed, I owned the F/H, I had to let it & it went from there. LLs want their tenants to succeed & do well. A lot are normal individuals not big companies. If you are in arrears or struggling, talk to them, you could be surprised.
6570 2018-09-02 16:55:13 We’ve been sold a project/dream and like snake oil it looks like it’s a pup...
6571 2018-09-02 16:54:58 My dad just grabbed my arm and wiped off grease/oil and then made me promise to never get a tattoo. I guess those two things are similar??
6572 2018-09-02 16:54:55 @realDonaldTrump Very political funeral of McCain. Obama & Bush for bipartisanship. LOL. Obama made military weak & anti Christian principle policies. Gay marriage, abortion. Bush low IQ and got us into Iraq for no reason. Didn't make a deal to get paid back from the oil there.
6573 2018-09-02 16:54:52 İf u want to see Barbarian pls face to Middle East and. See what Usa and other European countries doing there for the oil..Even ISIS is very old friend of Eastern world..All terrorists are using western army weapons..
6574 2018-09-02 16:54:39 Taking the oil we bought yesterday back. Jw opened it And it had old oil in it  who does this?  oh there is a lesson in this!
6575 2018-09-02 16:54:35 And then make another spreadsheet showing the provincial & federal grants & subsidies to various oil sands projects since the 1960s, and compare that with the actual profits of companies like Shell & Suncor.
6576 2018-09-02 16:54:12 I hate going to get my oil changed by myself
6577 2018-09-02 16:54:10 Cha nje imagine eating cooking oil nah
6578 2018-09-02 16:54:06 A side question: is Big Oil good or bad in Gerber's post? I can't tell anymore. $TSLA
6579 2018-09-02 16:54:01 Thanks. Do you dispute the article allegation of past financial loss or lack of profit and risk of financial collapse? From int rate rise/lower oil price/some sort of house of cards weakness? If fracking less common i assume oil price would rise/ differential AB v US price less
6580 2018-09-02 16:53:52 So what were we celebrating by having oil in turkana what difference is there#PunguzaBeiYaMafuta
6581 2018-09-02 16:53:39 A gas oil voy a pasar la moto . No me dura nada laa nafta

6583 2018-09-02 16:53:19 Can’t be any worse than Lamar Smith. The GOP members are a who’s who of politicians owned by oil and gas.

どちらも合いますが、変化で言うとMOTUL300Vです。

なんかガソリンを変えたかのような…もはやオイル交換というよりカスタムです(^_^;)

6592 2018-09-02 16:52:16 Heat an empty pan on a stove until it is too hot to touch

Add butter, oil, or cooking spray

Add egg, white should start cooking immediately

Add a Tbsp of water and cover, egg is done when the white over the yolk cooks

Drain and serve
6593 2018-09-02 16:52:11 Or... drink Oil. We cannot drink oil.
6594 2018-09-02 16:52:06 Go put some drip oil in. You’ve had enough rain.

6603 2018-09-02 16:51:21 Don't have to invade.  Alberta/Sask on the point of joining the US voluntarily.  Imagine a doubling of their oil export value overnight!  Trudeau and his progressive idiots may have destroyed Canada.
6604 2018-09-02 16:51:16 But I’m over baring and won’t buy anything with palm oil so 
6605 2018-09-02 16:51:11 The US government must stop importing oil from venezuela, let that communist country run out of income. There should be an oil embargo.
6606 2018-09-02 16:51:11 Yes that's why US is a true democracy and they have term limits for the president The constitution is also an amazing thing to protect peoples rights and keep the power in the hands of the people, unlike a radical socialist country like Venezuela who had nothing but oil
6607 2018-09-02 16:51:07 It was horrible so Mam used to give us something called vitavel which was orange syrup with vitamins straight after cod liver oil. 
6608 2018-09-02 16:50:54 Has anyone checked the Turkana oil? This hike maybe because they're trying to sell off the oil.

6609 2018-09-02 16:50:51 This won’t kill them now (I don’t think) but once you get rid of them, a good way to keep them at bay is some peppermint oil mixed with water. I keep mine in an old windex bottle and spray it around the doors, windows, edges of the floor, etc. every month or so

6611 2018-09-02 16:50:42 Oh I dunno. But I take your point about an oil event.
6612 2018-09-02 16:50:40 Well price of oil is going up all-round the world so what is the fess about
6613 2018-09-02 16:50:37 Actually he’s completely correct. Ignorance is not going to change the fact that we absolutely need oil and gas.
6614 2018-09-02 16:50:34 Her PR people will be burning the midnight oil. They'll come up with something
6615 2018-09-02 16:50:23 Jealous, much? Go out & find your own oil, then!
6616 2018-09-02 16:50:23 I think I know where to get the white stuff, thanks though. Cause this bitch wouldn’t said some shit like “black castor oil and vitamin E”
6617 2018-09-02 16:50:14 Right. And think about who might be funding those ‘studies’ on coconut oil. I’ll wait.

6619 2018-09-02 16:49:59 Hem. Bread goes stale. Oil doesn't!
6620 2018-09-02 16:49:56 it’s weird that you have so many feelings re: palm oil but you don’t even understand the intricacies of the dairy industry?
I agree with you on palm oil. I try to avoid it, but to say it isn’t vegan, I disagree with.
6621 2018-09-02 16:49:41 Well that industry was based on legacy oil.  With shale I don’t think holding back on capital investment is even an option.

They are not on the left, they are neoliberals. It is easy to be to the left of Trump, it takes leadership to #LeadOnClimate and be progressive
6625 2018-09-02 16:49:22 Invade a sovereign country that hasn’t provoked us and just happens to have oil? Please explain your “thinking”, if that’s what you call it.

あっあっリプが激しい 毎日茶仁さんのついっとみてるのでヒュースケンくんかわいいなあっていう気持ちになっています 強く生きて欲しい ねましょ？(？
6628 2018-09-02 16:49:08 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…
6629 2018-09-02 16:49:08 Oil touching a rly hot part of the engine create a lot of white smoke
Might be that
6630 2018-09-02 16:49:01 It's a scam, just like humane meat. Certified palm oil is still linked to deforestation bcs the voluntary standards are a joke.
6631 2018-09-02 16:48:58 world is won by clever brave men. it is good when they are also good men.
6632 2018-09-02 16:48:57 how about keeping your oil for your people instead of selling your resources
6633 2018-09-02 16:48:51 Your brain and perceptions of reality must have become woolly. Nothing else can explain such a demonstrably false position. Some fish oil might help nourish the brain - a few barrels ought to do the job.
6634 2018-09-02 16:48:47 “Aberdeen Nixon”. Disappointed. Somehow “we’ve got a blowout on oil well Delta - better call Aberdeen Nixon!” sounds more appropriate than anything even remotely connected with cricket.

私の性癖x性癖って感じでなんかもう無理。すこ
6636 2018-09-02 16:48:41 Lol yeah idk why olive oil i mean vasseline is a great substitute but idk about olive oil lol 
6637 2018-09-02 16:48:40 ฝันดีนะคะพี่สาว @iam_Oil
6638 2018-09-02 16:48:33 The problem is our way of living is dependant on oil. Plastic is a requirement in today society. Everything from toys to medical equipment. What we can do is be ethical in our use and stop buying from the Middle East.
6639 2018-09-02 16:48:30 Kunzima. I will ask next time I eat anyone's Rice if they rinsed it and if there's cooking oil I  it.
6640 2018-09-02 16:48:28 Nigeria wasn't the only oil based economy hit by the oil price. Most economists concluded that the economy was due to slow down but could have escaped a recession with right policies. The policies (or lack of) of the current regime drove the economy into a recession.
6641 2018-09-02 16:48:19 Sabun semua blh, bahkan dia menyarankan kl kita sdh punya sabun sendiri, pakai saja, yg penting no sulfur, no tea tree oil. Sunlight aja blh.
6642 2018-09-02 16:48:17 @peta, bhai this is tarka laga coconut oil. There is difference b/w ghee n oil, which by ur limited knowledge cannot be seen!!
6643 2018-09-02 16:48:14 セイくんに頼みなよ(･∀･)ﾉ♪
6644 2018-09-02 16:48:06 Woah! I think you are hugely over reacting here. I didn't write any comment where I swore or called landlords names. I think you have taken this all too personally.
6645 2018-09-02 16:48:02 Dividing families and abusing children systematically with drugs, neglect, and violence?  Selling their soles to the Kremlin for the oil & gas industry?  Attempting to crash the world economy with a tariff/trade war?  Good stuff.
6646 2018-09-02 16:48:00 They work there bcoz of d earning power due to oil wealth. D oil wealth was discovered with western technology & tapped till today w/western technology. If not for d oil wealth that is made possible by western technology no one would want to live in such places.
6647 2018-09-02 16:47:44 だんな様、お誕生日おめでとうございます。これからもご一緒にmesemoa.とプリンスを応援いたしましょう。今でもライブに足を運ばれてるのを見て私も頑張らないといけないと思ってるのですが・・・。またどこかでお会いできればと思います。（昨年の御殿場で挨拶に行ってればと後悔してます）
6648 2018-09-02 16:47:41 Lorraine what is your price point, contract and size?  iran supply disruption should keep prices high.  i was short at 68.45 and ended up flipping the position long at 69.05 and eventually turning a profit.
6649 2018-09-02 16:47:37 ね！！！ちゃ！！！！い！！！！ま！！！！！す！！！えっえっあぶらしゃの初ひうすけ来ただけで私もうダメかも恋に落ちちゃ、ひゅすけかっこよ、あ、あぶらさんよ絵かっこよくて好きでひゅすけかっこよくて好きでもう好き×好き=愛してる ありがとうございます幸せです………！！！！！！！！
6650 2018-09-02 16:47:34 fuck it all Mr.Swamy, it is useless to fight for anyone on this planet. it is just a huge group of selfish bootlickers. i think you should also channel your energy in making big and great things for yourself. when modi is sleeping, why should anyone care???
6651 2018-09-02 16:47:30 Don't even ask, there's oil everywhere
6652 2018-09-02 16:47:13 Straight men??  like I can’t get over how he thought olive oil would suffice? 

Like are we stuffing turkeys for thanksgiving here?
6653 2018-09-02 16:47:10 With my province burning to hell, our forestry having previously been decimated by the Pine Beetle epidemic, I'm more interested in fighting Climate Change. We can't do that and continue to expand oil sands extraction. Something has to give. How do we do this with the least pain?
6654 2018-09-02 16:47:07 I agree that palm oil isn’t sustainable. It harms animals. It’s also very hard to avoid in products. To say it’s not vegan makes veganism even more inaccessible. 

the point that I was responding to was that you said dairy doesn’t harm animals when it flat out does
6655 2018-09-02 16:47:06 Great economy handed to Trump by Obama, foreign enemies controlling/manipulating POTUS including Russia and NK, more jobs than people available? Just not true, highest oil producer based on discovery that has 0 to do with Trump, less business regulations = rampant corruption...
6656 2018-09-02 16:46:50 My ex used to scrub it with a hard brush and pour bleach on it. Dried it up real quick.
 
Had a Texan friend who mentioned the gasoline method was what the men working the oil fields used. Just try to remember not to light up a smoke.  
6657 2018-09-02 16:46:37 i use this sea salt spray 2-3 times a day :/ i started rubbing tea tree oil too 
6658 2018-09-02 16:46:36 Haha! Worse, easy to get oil almost gone. Big reserves are in Arctic Sea. But poor Russia too backward to get them. Need Exxon. Sanctions say “nope.” Tex Drillerson fail to make it happen. When oil gone, Putin gone.
6659 2018-09-02 16:46:33 きっと会えます。たぶん……
6660 2018-09-02 16:46:28 Absolutely correct. #Fossil is the wrong way be it coal, lignite, oil or LNG. Environmental degradation is also the wrong way to secure the worlds' rising energy requirements ("energy crops", (rain)forest destruction, ...). We have to promote science & learn to live with nuclear!
6661 2018-09-02 16:46:27 Oil co returns aren’t exclusively valued on cash flow metrics. They are akin to mining in that most of the upfront money goes to proving the resource exists and is recoverable. 

After that it trying to find a buyer who will pay close to what you’re worth on paper.
6662 2018-09-02 16:46:25 Liar OBAMA Fraud Absolutely Has No Moral Compass To Lecture Pres. #TRUMP,The ONLY PRESIDENT In History Doing COUP Against Pres. Of United State,He Did 9 COUP, OBAMA Encouraged G7 Allow Recruit Of ISIS & Allowed ISIS Sale Oil @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump
6663 2018-09-02 16:46:19 Another way of looking at is is you're a government assassin who killed people so Republicans could get rich on oil. And now you use your prejudices to justify your war crimes.
6664 2018-09-02 16:46:03 But in the social security the politicians won't reduce taxes
6665 2018-09-02 16:46:02 Trading update: Crude Oil (CLV18) … Systems are Hedged: L1 S1 with an open position profit of $42
6666 2018-09-02 16:46:01 @MeghanMcCain I wept during your beautiful eulogy for your Father yesterday.  I was proud to be an American as you stood strong. You delivered a message that needed to be made to the lowly snake oil salesmen that stain Washington from the House, Senate, and White House.
6667 2018-09-02 16:45:59 That will only kill us faster. We need to manage the nutrient cycles and stop flushing away our topsoil. Oil is not food.
6668 2018-09-02 16:45:57 Oil on the road?
6669 2018-09-02 16:45:56 mix aqueous cream with glycerine and tissue oil

6672 2018-09-02 16:45:48 Could it be that veganism is related to peak oil? And I mean it in a macabre way. What better mean to keep oil prices up to make shale and tar sands satisfying speculation and investment?
6673 2018-09-02 16:45:41 Shout out to the inventor of RainX. Best two bucks of opulence I ever spent at an oil change. Where has this stuff been all my road tripping life?
6674 2018-09-02 16:45:29 This is Angela Aamer United States of America Agriculture Commissioner contacting you the oil tankers on the rail must go to Louisianna to the refinery for refineing.
6675 2018-09-02 16:45:26 Made myself a lovely broccoli slaw salad with sesame oil, shaved almonds and pinneaple. Then I couldn’t find the fucking thing. Well. hell how’d it end up in my bed?
6676 2018-09-02 16:45:20 I think you're confusing the ends (stopping animal suffering) with the means (not eating animal products). If a non-animal product leads to animal suffering, as is the case wth palm oil, why does i it matter that it did not come from an animal?
6677 2018-09-02 16:45:10 هذي الاراضي الفاضية كلها تابعة للبرج
6678 2018-09-02 16:45:01 But I do agree, he did say life as we live it now. The future has possibilities beyond oil, we just need to be receptive to them.
6679 2018-09-01 23:59:59 dijeron que habia jornada especial.
6680 2018-09-01 23:59:58 Don't forget about Manitoba, we got lots to offer, most notably a northern port in Churchill that could be used to ship oil globally.
6681 2018-09-01 23:59:54 Yep. Leave a bit of the oil in there, sautéed shallots with butter, add some peppercorns, then deglaze with brandy, flambé, then a splash of white wine, beef bone broth, heavy cream, reduce, stir in some Dijon mustard and butter to finish.
6682 2018-09-01 23:59:49 For sure. Quebec doesn't need oil money anyway. The Federal Government slides them plenty to keep their yaps shut.
6683 2018-09-01 23:59:36 Now it's time to start putting my hair growth oil back in my head and get me some twist so my hair can get back long cause this bald head shit ain't me 
6684 2018-09-01 23:59:11 Only ‘care’ when oil is involved or a central bank.
6685 2018-09-01 23:58:51 Haha!  Human Oil Spill...
6686 2018-09-01 23:58:46 Am I the only one who seems to think this looks like a lovely oil painting? No not saying I think it's fake, I'm saying it looks like an oil painting, as in - gorgeous with the ways the colors blend and how washed out everything looks lol.
6687 2018-09-01 23:58:41 But am i the only one thinking that @Mohammed_Lai is suppose to be there?? #AMVCA2018
6688 2018-09-01 23:58:28 I'm like thinking of doing an oil painting, in a big ass canvas.
6689 2018-09-01 23:58:23 if you really cared about canadas future/environment, you would have invested the $10b in renewable energy. spending on oil to help canadas future? lets save the DVD factories too. #idiot were going to be still paying for this pipeline long after oil is useful.

6695 2018-09-01 23:57:18 Interesting as @realDonaldTrump bullying policies toward Venezuela are a large part of the calamity. Yes, Murduro is bad, but their oil was a country vital economic source. US oil expertise could have helped, yet POTUS pummeled & bullied.

6719 2018-09-01 23:56:18 Dont hear you complaining about the 25 dollar per barrel less your paying for our oil. Yet you repeatedly talk about extreme tariffs on dairy. Tariffs imposed to prevent the dumping of an American dairy surplus on us and wiping out our entire industry.
6720 2018-09-01 23:56:15 Hot Laps underway. Lucas Oil ASCS has wrapped up. Lucas Oil POWRi Midgets on track.
6721 2018-09-01 23:56:15 I know I am late to the game but @jiffylube is incredible and vacuumed my car and cleaned my windows and changed all the fluids so quickly, for only $36, and they explained everything in the engine to me bc I don’t know cars.

Definitely go to them if you need your oil changed.
6722 2018-09-01 23:56:06 I hotbox my room with my diffuser and peppermint oil and now my entire house smells like peppermint. The smell leaked under my door and all the way downstairs
6723 2018-09-01 23:55:59 Franklin sells snake oil with Harbaugh.  Big 10 really knows how to pick their coaches.  
6724 2018-09-01 23:55:42 Too much peppermint oil in the diffuser 
6725 2018-09-01 23:55:38 @POTUS if you really want to piss off Canada stop taking their oil sands.

6728 2018-09-01 23:55:12 They will never admit they were wrong. It’s easier for them to believe the planets are also genes against them than to believe they were suckered by a snake oil salesman.
6729 2018-09-01 23:55:09 @NEembracinglife Thou anointest my head with oil; Thank You Jesus, for entrusting me with Your Open Bible; forbidden in Closed Bible America below; when a Christian Nation died 6/26/2015, and the United States of Sodom and Gomorrah was born. Mole Dirt.
6730 2018-09-01 23:55:08 Ughhhh girl forreal anytime I travel I get bug bites like by the dozens :/ u know of any natural remedies I put acv, and some tea tree oil
6731 2018-09-01 23:55:07 Oil trains are fucking scary.
I’d rather have pipelines any day.
6732 2018-09-01 23:54:42 If we had a federal government that wanted the oil industry and the pipeline to flourish they would be investigating, appealing and making every effort to get Canada back on track economically. But, sadly, we don’t!

6734 2018-09-01 23:54:31 Thats what is going to happen if investment in oil in Canada. We'll all become carriers of water and hewers of wood. Ahhhhhhh, bring me back to the 17th century.
6735 2018-09-01 23:54:18 Would you still love me the same?
6736 2018-09-01 23:54:16 I think after this attempt to control energy via demonising CO2, either fails or succeeds, petrol will remain, it’s just too perfect for small transport, diesel for medium, though nuclear may replace the bunker oil for some shipping.
6737 2018-09-01 23:54:08 Thank you. Let me check what I have. Really think I don’t have anything that’s similar. In the past I’ve only used conditioner followed by coconut oil.
6738 2018-09-01 23:54:04 And if it's half way what are you aiming at?
Ps: Coconut oil overnight helps
6739 2018-09-01 23:54:01 some people can’t go a day without their significant other but i cant go a day without my tea tree oil
6740 2018-09-01 23:53:49 We’re the ones buying all that oil, because we’re so primitive we still burn stuff we dig out of the ground for energy.
6741 2018-09-01 23:53:47 Yea it’s gone get solid after you add oil as egg and bake it lol like what sense does that even make lol
6742 2018-09-01 23:53:47 oil and water dont mix that's why they out at the beach washing off the fish
6743 2018-09-01 23:53:37 (Ratio said combine everything BUT the oil and then add it slowly while whisking, but no dice)
6744 2018-09-01 23:53:37 Just started a job as a gs mechanic (general service). The people there are great. The only downside is spending an hour scrubbing the oil and grease from my knees and shoulders.
6745 2018-09-01 23:53:36 I’m rly sitting out here with my car hood open like I have any knowledge of car engines huh
I checked my oil and it seems sort of low, but I’m scared it’s a deeper issue
6746 2018-09-01 23:53:34 ,.....did they even care to count that women made up 50%?? But who cares about them, narrative and all....

6750 2018-09-01 23:53:13 Are you genuinely curious, or just challenging? If the former, my diet, transportation, home, etc. are all explained in gory detail in my book. If the latter, my DD is a 1984 car that I maintain myself and run on veggie oil.
6751 2018-09-01 23:53:08 I definitely needed oil thx for reminding me
6752 2018-09-01 23:53:02 Well it’s time for Justin Trudeau to push back no more oil for anybody but ourselves no more wheat beans what ever the USA buys from us wood you name it. Grow some balls
6753 2018-09-01 23:53:01 PROtip everybody: If you have hummus that you can’t eat fast enough, put it in a container, smooth the top, drizzle olive oil and bring it to a party. Everyone will be impressed, they won’t know it’s not gourmet and you’ll be helping reduce food waste.
6754 2018-09-01 23:52:53 Our President is forcing Iran to cut their prices on oil in order to sell it to its buyers, Iran better stop its nonsense and threaten us cause they’re losing and their country will be worse than Venezuela.
6755 2018-09-01 23:52:49 I just grabbing my oil and lets go! 
6756 2018-09-01 23:52:38 I just tried that for the first time last night but I think I used too much oil 
6757 2018-09-01 23:52:28 Oh and I don’t have my head in the sand. I’m quite aware of the variety of issues that plague our provinces and country. Pipelines and oil sands are a minor problem compared to other social and economic situations we are experiencing that is crushing our country.
6758 2018-09-01 23:52:17 MK.16:18-(NOT SOME SEEPING OIL COMING OUT OF SOME FOOLING FOOL NOT GO THERE TO THEM)-SPARE ME THAT I MAY RECOVER STRENGTH(JESUS WANTS STREGTHEN U SATAN WANTS TO WEAKEN U ONLY-WHAT GOD/gOD U WANT TO SERVE?)-
6759 2018-09-01 23:51:43 Kainggit huhu sana oil
6760 2018-09-01 23:50:53 Yes I’ve been through many areas and experienced dry conditions. But the forest fires are a totally unrelated subject to the oil sands.
6761 2018-09-01 23:50:29 Why are liberals rehabilitating a man who killed 1.5 million Iraqi civilians, in a war based on lies, for capitalist oil barons?
6762 2018-09-01 23:50:24 Note to cooks and chefs. You don’t need truffle oil in fuckin everything.
6763 2018-09-01 23:50:18 1.- All the money produced by our oil it´s controled by the state, no one get the benefits.
2.- This is not a dictatorial state, it´s a monopolic system.
3.- The state has only one priority: hold the power no matter how.
4.- We haven´t a civil war, but the disaster it´s that big.

6767 2018-09-01 23:49:17 I’m curious of where you think we have uncontrolled burning of fossil fuels? We don’t just burn the oil because we can.
6768 2018-09-01 23:49:17 wild growth oil
6769 2018-09-01 23:49:00 How about starting with the oil companies as utilities first!
6770 2018-09-01 23:48:43 Awe you ain’t got nothin to offer but some baby oil to rub onnat mfer 
6771 2018-09-01 23:48:19 Awww thanks guys. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS We have to figure out what to do with jobs related to oil and gas, energy and mining sectors in general. @RachelNotley @jkenney @CPC_HQ @Muskoka_CPC_EDA @albertaNDP @ylc_jlc @CJPMYC @CanadianPM @JustinTrudeau @liberal_party @parti_liberal
6772 2018-09-01 23:48:03 It stinks cuz of food it is fed....we dont allow fish I buy tuna with oil every great while cuz the oil is good for them...but they won't touch the stuff.  These days they have many ways to combat the odor problem.

6774 2018-09-01 23:47:21 George W Bush killed 1.5 Iraqi civilians in a war for capitalist oil barons, based on lies, and was fraudulently selected by the Supreme Court against the vote of the people.
6775 2018-09-01 23:47:05 My skin feels so dry. Would moisturizing with baby oil clog up my pores? 
6776 2018-09-01 23:46:50 Tomorrow’s todo list:
- Transmission oil and engine oil.
- ID papers.
- Beauty salon.
- Drive my mom.
- Tie shop.

6777 2018-09-01 23:46:33 Now drilling companies specialized in oil and gas continue in their work without the scarcity of the future danger to the universe, man and life.There are studies carried out by these companies.Positive and negative. This policy is in place

6780 2018-09-01 23:45:59 First Nations have been here for 13,000 years. When exactly did they give up ownership of the land and the mineral rights to the oil going through that pipeline?
6781 2018-09-01 23:45:46 Whip together 1 pound Ahi Tuna with 2 cups chimichanga. Add generous amounts of Olive Oil. Chill.  Serve warm.
6782 2018-09-01 23:45:45 if oil is made from fossil fuels and plastic is made from oil, then fake dinosaurs are made from real dinosaurs
6783 2018-09-01 23:45:27 anyone that tells you to use coconut oil on your skin hates you
6784 2018-09-01 23:45:11 Because of oil that's it
6785 2018-09-01 23:45:09 I'm not even talking about any dead people other than the people Bush had wiped off the face of Earth for oil and re-election. The fact you disagree with Trump and praise Bush proves so much more about your moral compass than my comments say about whether I'm lonely or miserable
6786 2018-09-01 23:44:53 Massage trains are the only trains I approve of; grab that body oil and esssketit!
6787 2018-09-01 23:44:48 @Greenpeace  Petition China not to use the dirtiest oil on the planet,  the Canadian Tar sands.    Ask them if they are committed to stopping global warming.
6788 2018-09-01 23:44:42 Johnny Depp is sucked into his bed, which then erupted a gusher of blood the volume of which cannot be matched by all the oil wells in Texas. LOL #ANightmareOnElmStreet

6791 2018-09-01 23:44:05 The real joke Gary is the Southern Resident whales spend a large part of their time in Puget Sound on the American side off Cherry Point where  the US refines oil and tankers ply the waters 24/7 out of Canadian jurisdiction.
6792 2018-09-01 23:44:02 JT bought the project with our $ - to insure it will NEVER get built - & it won’t. He hates the WEST & he hates OIL more! Wake up Canada!
6793 2018-09-01 23:43:29 i need to find local oil plug. y’all, help?
6794 2018-09-01 23:43:20 @350  Please petition China and it's leader to cancel all contracts using the dirtiest oil on the planet,  the Canadian Tar sands.    Ask them to show real leadership on this issue.
6795 2018-09-01 23:43:11 wait im an idiot its not the lost woods its the haunted woods. or whatever the fuck. the one victorian style town that got sold snake oil and all turned into monsters and shit
6796 2018-09-01 23:42:55 He probably wants his competitors to be forced to pay higher taxes so that his company will get ahead and the increase in sales will make oodles more for the earnings he gets in residuals.  A bit like how Rockefeller wants us to stop buying foreign oil over domestic.
6797 2018-09-01 23:42:40 y porque el unico? ese es el problema de los y que sabiondos en politica el desprecio por los demas ciudadanos.
6798 2018-09-01 23:42:39 Clove oil.
6799 2018-09-01 23:42:31 National disgrace can't wait to see more oil  trains pass my shop
6800 2018-09-01 23:42:26 Alberta has a $30/tonne price on emissions from their oil sector. NL pollutes for free. Something to be proud of.
6801 2018-09-01 23:42:15 Using southern resident Killer whales as one excuse to halt pipeline absolutely ludicrous considering they spend a large portion of their time in Puget Sound on the American side off Cherry point where the US refines oil and tankers ply the water 24/7 out of Canadian jurisdiction
6802 2018-09-01 23:42:14 I love Trader Joe's argan oil, it is unreasonably well-priced for 100% organic. under $10 for 1.7 oz & not tested on animals :D  I just add a little lavender oil and put it on my straggly split ends
6803 2018-09-01 23:42:05 Hi Vance, if your #UK taxpayer ask the Tory Leaders why did #Cameron sponsor #SomaliLondon Conference on 2/23/2012, 5/7/2013 and 5/11/2017 at taxpayers expenses? Also who created Soma Oil and Gas on 4/26/2013 & Somalia Fishguard Ltd? Why he resigned and blamed Brexit? @UKLabour
6804 2018-09-01 23:41:53 @Stephen_Letts @MathiasCormann The credit crunch 2008/09 was caused by the 2008 oil price shock. The next heart attack may happen at a lower oil price  #ausbiz
6805 2018-09-01 23:41:50 China is importing another million barrels per day every year. The infrastructure they have in place for receiving boat loads of crude oil is out of this world. Crude oil and LNG markets are alive and thriving.
6806 2018-09-01 23:41:49 Between my Salux cloth & apricot oil , my skin feels like butta 
6807 2018-09-01 23:41:42 Try to avoid washing your hair everyday. Constant shampooing leaves hair and skin dry and will increase oil production to overcompensate.

6810 2018-09-01 23:41:24 Maybe @NicoSEnea can come up with a weed product to fill it with. A CBD oil in here to calm the room would be sweet.

6812 2018-09-01 23:41:20 My son explains that his Mac & Cheese needs olive oil from his grandfather's Greek Village. Now that's Canadian fusion cuisine!
6813 2018-09-01 23:41:16 I was frying something and forgot to turn off the burner when I took the meat out. The lid was on and everything and it made like a BOOM noise. so i lifted the lid and the oil was on fire so I took it off the burner and put the lid back on and set it out in the back yard
6814 2018-09-01 23:41:10 Chinatown market is usually wheat flour, palm oil, and your leftovers, whatever.

6818 2018-09-01 23:40:10 You have an 8.8 Billion dollar trade surplus with Canada but you decided to try to rip it up, be a bully.  We have our own military, we also are your biggest oil and hydro supplier.  We can wait until you're impeached. Shouldn't be long
6819 2018-09-01 23:39:54 But the oil industry is not quickly becoming a relic of the past. That's just something people say and feel good about. Demand for oil is still on the rise. We've been hearing the doomsayers predicting the Peak Oil since the 1970s and it isn't happening.
6820 2018-09-01 23:39:26 I love fossil fuels, I can’t see one rational negative.
Nuclear can power grids but oil is eerily perfect for portability & powering transport.
6821 2018-09-01 23:39:23 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
6822 2018-09-01 23:39:16 So change the oil in a jeep or wash the windows in the warehouse or whatever it is you did in the military
6823 2018-09-01 23:39:07 hay una difencia y es la reputacion del uno y del otro.
6824 2018-09-01 23:39:05 #Africa includes some of #China’s largest suppliers of oil and other #commodities and the tiny East #African nation of #Djibouti hosts its first overseas military base.

6826 2018-09-01 23:39:00 When will it be Turkish oil wrestling.
6827 2018-09-01 23:38:56 As important as Mustard Oil is in North India, so is Coconut in the South of India. Where are your writings on the many medical, dietary and cosmetic benefits of Mustard Oil?
6828 2018-09-01 23:38:53 : "And then I'll join OPEC!"
: "You? You make Mario and Luigi look like brain surgeons! You're too ignorant to be an oil tycoon!"
6829 2018-09-01 23:38:52 I've been up since 7am stretching, priming and color washing a whopping 2 whole canvases. No wonder by the time I get to actually painting anything my level of patience drops to me finger painting and microwaving oil for the chaos
6830 2018-09-01 23:38:50 I have coconut oil in my hair and my iggy came up and starting licking my hair 
6831 2018-09-01 23:38:45 i did a full skincare routine and i have lavender oil running through my diffuser and i’m playing botw and this would only be made better if i had wine
6832 2018-09-01 23:38:37 Nothing personal but I won't engage you anymore Oil is in many products but that doesn't mean we have to put through an unsafe pipeline The courts ruled get over it If Alberta wants the pipeline do it right good-bye
6833 2018-09-01 23:38:36 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
6834 2018-09-01 23:38:12 No no no no no! Not 1 more of our brothers and sisters are to die on the battlefield field so oil companies and the politicians they own, can get richer on our kids blood!
6835 2018-09-01 23:38:01 & OIL!!!! Venezuela has the worlds largest reserves
6836 2018-09-01 23:37:54 Let the people drown. But for the love of God save the oil refineries! 
6837 2018-09-01 23:37:17 Wait the accuracy is on point but it would be truffle oil and stale sriracha popcorn
6838 2018-09-01 23:37:07 I'm not that sure about 'conveniently'. I think we somewhat overestimate how much bank and oil company executives are paid 'legally' because of the lifestyles we see. It would have been intersting to see his tax returns whilst he was in the private sector.
6839 2018-09-01 23:37:03 Guess coconut oil would get removed from the list of poisons soon too
6840 2018-09-01 23:36:52 Steel beams don’t melt without controlled demolition! Scientology is the only true science! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
6841 2018-09-01 23:36:51 Jed, you're arguing semantics. Legalization is on a spectrum. We are in the spectrum. Will wants to push that progress forward, not argue about whether CBD oil "counts".
6842 2018-09-01 23:36:27 私もバサロ呼ばわりします。50代なんで。
6843 2018-09-01 23:36:15 Umm into a natural currant quite deep whete little impact, yes influx of more people means projects like dockside green needed not the disaster of treatment plant currently bring built. Hyperbole for everyone! Oil will flow, people litter, demand drives consumption big problem
6844 2018-09-01 23:36:14 Alaska their fields are slowing down! It’s estimated that we have hit peak oil! Saudis are bullshiting on their reserves by most accounts! Maybe they just wish to destroy our economy to own our oil supplies!
6845 2018-09-01 23:35:22 Yeah we need good relations with Canada for storm chasing. Oh I forgot oil too, for the chase vehicle.
6846 2018-09-01 23:34:50 I like what Norway is doing , they export the oil but use renewal resources.
6847 2018-09-01 23:34:39 This is sad. One day you all will awaken at 4am, eyes wide, and be hit with the fact that you sacrificed any morals you ever had for control of the country under a 2 bit snake oil salesman. And you’ll repeat the words of the co-pilot of the Enola Gay, ‘my God, what have we done?’
6848 2018-09-01 23:34:29 It’s Fathers Day in Australia so I’m bathing in my children’s adoration before changing the oil in the cars and trying to farm a shield from THE MOTHERLODE.
6849 2018-09-01 23:34:26 Tastes like Jack Daniels, leftover pizza, Halloween candy, breakfast for pizza
Smells like baby oil, sweat, and cannabis smoke
6850 2018-09-01 23:34:26 My guess is Putin wants oil reserves in the Arctic, which are becoming more accessible because of global warming.
6851 2018-09-01 23:34:09 you supposed to put beard oil in your mustache?

6855 2018-09-01 23:33:15 Thank you for posting. This article doesn't mention Russia's involvement in Venezuela's oil and Russian sanctions but piecing it all together is mind blowing.
6856 2018-09-01 23:33:06 America hasn't been great yet. Biggest economy and military, but that's it, everything else is substandard. Your dollar is propped up by oil and you military kills women and children. So, not great, nowhere near great.
6857 2018-09-01 23:32:54 Behave mate, Jeff will be calling you to pit on the formation lap because of oil pressure issues and you’ll watch the 5 red lights from catering
6858 2018-09-01 23:32:43 And everything... literally every... fucking... thing... is viewed through the lens of race.

But don't you dare call them racist.
6859 2018-09-01 23:32:36 The current discount on Cdn oil not fetching a world price is $15 billion/yr, or $41 million/day.  Would pay for a lot of doctors, teachers, renewable energy & tech, aboriginal housing & support, highways, opioid & drug treatments, day care, transfer payments, senior care, etc.
6860 2018-09-01 23:32:14 Excited As Fuck To Go Home And Use My Oil Diffuser
6861 2018-09-01 23:32:10 It’s planed they are our competition in oil they take our Oil at bargain basement pricing, profit 100 million a day off of it! They they ship it back up to the east coast and Ontario  that transferring cost added! They don’t want us selling cheap oil to someone else
6862 2018-09-01 23:31:39 Haha we have two of the exact same except the scent is cedarwood essential oil or ginger.
6863 2018-09-01 23:31:35 Pour olive oil on the ledge then shut and lock the window, pull up a side chair and just watch the festivities.

6871 2018-09-01 23:30:17 @TODAYshow lol, get your expert to explain all the chemicals in vaping please? This was the worst report I’ve seen with no research or facts. Most e-juices have nil chemicals and only nicotine if added by user. E juice has vegetable oil and flavouring only. Do research!!!

6877 2018-09-01 23:29:37 My hair loves argan oil more than anything
6878 2018-09-01 23:29:35 I agree

Then Canada no longer has to make those discount nafta concessions on our resources 

So oil water and electricity etc...

Full price for you

If you don’t want it..
Good luck with the Middle East and Russia 
6879 2018-09-01 23:29:25 also, make sure of the so-obvious-we-forget-to-think-about-them:
- enough water/sleep
- balance of caffeine (that way you don’t have mini-caffeine withdrawals)
- get an eye exam
- releasing tension in your neck/shoulders/jaw through out the day 

lavender oil helps for some
6880 2018-09-01 23:29:18 But you kinda get what you pay for with skincare. Rn I can’t afford crazy shit so I went really basic and don’t use serums just moisturizer and pure tea tree oil for spots.
6881 2018-09-01 23:29:14 @mwende_wavinya how can i get the oil? And at how much?
6882 2018-09-01 23:29:11 Yes, bad trade agmts need re-negotiation. But Coal & Oil have not demonstrated cleanliness. Lobbied and still lobby against real #GlobalWarming solutions that would curb carbon emissions. Cost of some advantages way too high. Need real solutions like 4th industrial revolution.
6883 2018-09-01 23:29:06 YES, I HAVE FINALLY ARRIVED HOME after 4,300 miles, 10 days, 1 oil change, 1 flat tire, a day of vomiting and diarrhea, a broken electric razor, and seeing lots of cool places and new faces.

6889 2018-09-01 23:28:19 @Lamyy__ Baby girl! What is in that glow oil please? You know once I feel a tiny bump on my face, I wash, use toner then apply just a little oil directly on it and it dries up. I really need to know please, it works like magic.
6890 2018-09-01 23:28:13 
6891 2018-09-01 23:28:00 We owe all of our current level of development and progress to the development of oil and gas. Canadians always want to be recognized at being the best at something and we are among the world leaders in sustainable environmentally responsible oil and gas extraction.
6892 2018-09-01 23:27:53 Hey oil keeps you looking young... at least that's what I say to myself when my typically dry skin decides to get oily randomly
6893 2018-09-01 23:27:53 And NICKELBACK.
6894 2018-09-01 23:27:51 Trump won the racist vote. That is all he & his supporters are about. The party of hate. Trump, GOP & Putin knew they could get that vote. Without the racist agenda & racist voters, Trump would only have the 1% donor class vote. Big oil etc. connected to Russia.

6898 2018-09-01 23:26:49 @RidgemontLube need a safe and reliable place to get your oil changed, then come on down and see Roy and his gang today. They will fix you up right.
6899 2018-09-01 23:26:45 Waited too long and couldn’t get an oil change. My light has been on almost a week. Husband, this will be on your to do list. Bc i suck at this lol
6900 2018-09-01 23:26:31 ....but we have water and oil.
6901 2018-09-01 23:26:30 I have to wash my car and get my oil changed  ... great
6902 2018-09-01 23:26:10 Just regular olive oil ?
6903 2018-09-01 23:26:07 The tea tree oil I’m using to kill mites is attracting bees... I could possibly ward them away with a mixture of apple vinegar and candles, but that would still leave me with mosquitoes.   RIP me, idk if I’m going to make it.
6904 2018-09-01 23:26:05 Bio Oil?
6905 2018-09-01 23:26:00 Hmmm I’ll have to look at that one this oil I got doesn’t work! Thank you! Ugh the trials of the face lol
6906 2018-09-01 23:25:54 “Rude”, I mumble, feeling the sting of hot oil on my bare skin as I fry pierogies wearing a bralette only
6907 2018-09-01 23:25:43 Yes Marilyn, exactly.
The Port of Van admitted 3,219 large foreign vessels in 2017 (coal, oil, container, etc).
BC Ferries ran 4,100 sailings into Tsawassen that same year.
7,319 total.
TMX will add 400 new arrivals per year, a 5.5% increase.
6908 2018-09-01 23:25:29 Anyone who embraces someone who trashes the spouse as @tedcruz has done ain't worth an oil stain on a busy highway.  Less so, probably.
6909 2018-09-01 23:25:25 That sounds like a socialist plan.  What's next,  takeover of the phone systems, oil companies, and the newspapers? Ingraham et al need to STFU and read the Constitution and process it.
6910 2018-09-01 23:25:19 Along with the 31 Lucas Oil Late Models, there are 24 modifieds, and 
22 sport mods here for tonight’s race at @PRPDirt! 
6911 2018-09-01 23:25:16 And I also coated them in olive oil before baking. This made them extra crunchy!
6912 2018-09-01 23:25:13 4 years
6913 2018-09-01 23:25:12 Keeping it simple. Grilled cheese on sunflower seed bread, baked beans and avocado w olive oil (after a 5+ h drive). How about you?
6914 2018-09-01 23:25:09 Tell him to go pound sand.  We’ll sell our water, power, oil, wood elsewhere and see how they make out.  I believe the Columbia river treaty is up for negotiation soon too.
6915 2018-09-01 23:25:05 Sht I thought the oil was sleeping, I nearly poured all into the pan HAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHA way pulos
6916 2018-09-01 23:25:03 Ha! For me, I know that roasted Jerusalem FArtichokes in garlic and olive oil will be an issue, but I make it a couple times a year anyway. There's something magical about the caramelized starchy garlic coating.
6917 2018-09-01 23:24:53 Everyone knows that avocado oil is all the new rage and if you're still using coconut yous basic af
6918 2018-09-01 23:24:50 Dishonored has whale oil, a bizarre technomagical substance extracted out of monstrous lovecraftian whales.

But it never quite went into spiritua-magical pollution from it or anything IIRC

6925 2018-09-01 23:23:30 I've been eating coconut all my life and coconut oil for years. Show me the toxicity, because I'm better now than ever.

6928 2018-09-01 23:22:47 All they’re interested is controlling American and sending soldiers overseas so they keep getting funded by NRA, military equipment manufacturing and oil companies.
6929 2018-09-01 23:22:39 And running Daesh oil, stealing land from the Kurds, outright theft of his citizens' bank accounts. Erdogan is nothing but a common thief! So much for his Sultanate dreams!
6930 2018-09-01 23:22:36 Add turmeric for brightening! Aloe for extra moisture! A few drops of rosehip seed oil, and that will be quite a kind mask! Substitute dairy yogurt with vegan or coconut if #vegan
6931 2018-09-01 23:22:14 Strong alignment with the West? We had that but nothing has improved. Rather they take from us and give us nothing in return. They take our oil, pollute our lands and give us back our money in form of aids hoping we continue fighting.
6932 2018-09-01 23:22:04 It would be the greatest of pleasures to see AB turn the oil taps off to the mainland. The biggest whiners would be same pipeline protestors.
6933 2018-09-01 23:21:49 Make matchstick carrots. Stir fry with mange tout in olive oil 3 mins. Prawns and garlic, 3 mins. Lemon juice coriander and chives. Then toss through spaghetti. Parmesan. Garlic bread. Rocket. Black pepper. Yum.
6934 2018-09-01 23:21:49 Black seed oil.....GET SOME
6935 2018-09-01 23:21:37 I finally gave in and ordered the deep cleansing oil from DHC (aka the only thing that my skin liked when I was a teen). Someday, my hormonal breakouts will go away, but until then, DHC it is.

6937 2018-09-01 23:21:17 Heavy rains have moved through at Volunteer Speedway for the Labor Day Classic for the Schaeffer's Oil Southern Nationals Bonus Series/Iron-Man Championship Late Model Series and the event has been postponed.  A make-up date will be announced at a later date.
6938 2018-09-01 23:21:09 Well he better start figuring out how he expects almost every product we use and wear can be made without oil and do it pretty fast lol
6939 2018-09-01 23:21:05 Neem + Tea Tree oil is good also
6940 2018-09-01 23:21:02 She also promised Suli Peek’s parents access to #Cannabis after the police forcibly removed the Cannabis oil which she was using.

The replacement never eventuated and Suli died.

6941 2018-09-01 23:20:41 Now Sunday Riley UFO oil seemed to help me a lot but I was still actively breaking out so I didn’t have my full attention on my scars, but that one I would recommend it’s I think $40 to get the smaller and maybe $80 for the bigger one? The smaller one lasted me 2 months
6942 2018-09-01 23:20:15 "I feel like I would need a 5th of olive oil to chase a cup of chest hair"
6943 2018-09-01 23:20:04 Mixed in. Grated russets, parsnips, and onion together. Then some eggs and panko. Fried in peanut oil.
6944 2018-09-01 23:19:52 I was skimming a stock and the bowl of oil fell, splashed my arm and face. 

Chef trick I learned then if you think it needs covering use cling film not a bandage or plaster or any material. Helps the burn too.
6945 2018-09-01 23:19:41 somebody buy me thc oil for my bday

6947 2018-09-01 23:19:20 He wants Canada to shut down the oil sands and buy all its oil from Saudi Arabia because when they run out we won’t need it anymore anyways. (He actually told me that.)

6949 2018-09-01 23:19:06 I washed my car and vacuumed only for them to offer it as a complimentary service during my oil change anyway  lmao
6950 2018-09-01 23:19:05 You are a big winner in this trade, printing papers and getting oil!
6951 2018-09-01 23:18:36 Shame on us for selling America oil and hydroelectricity for less than Canadians pay for these products. Shame on us for selling you raw lumber and paying you to import the finished product back to Canada. We have really taken advantage of America with the trade surplus you have.
6952 2018-09-01 23:18:21 I'm not sure there's much we can do about it. I was in India a few months ago. Smoke Stacks as far as the eye could see. Weather forecast says smoke or Haze on a good day. Oil just poured into the ground around every auto shop. None of these things we have control over
6953 2018-09-01 23:18:19 1) extended wear of lash extensions can and WILL destroy your own lashes no matter how upscale the salon, how experienced the artist, how gentle the adhesives, etc. but fortunately you get a new set of natural lashes about every ~6 weeks

3) bless castor oil

Fake oil is even worse
6962 2018-09-01 23:17:34 I love watching @IndyEleven games because I think they're great rivals, but it sure gives me a headache seeing all those lines on the field of Lucas Oil.
6963 2018-09-01 23:17:27 This is dumb in new ways.
6964 2018-09-01 23:17:26 Didn't America sell oil and rubber, essential to the war machine, to nazi germany well into 1940?
6965 2018-09-01 23:17:25 Climate change is utter nonsense you stupid woman. Fracking halved the price of oil you dim buffoon. @lbc
6966 2018-09-01 23:17:25 Is that our trade strategy now - hope they impeach Trump?

We are back to Mike Pearson diplomacy times.  After 73 the US needed our oil and we could be intransigent and Trudeau could bait Nixon.  They don't need our oil and gas anymore so we better figure out what they do need.
6967 2018-09-01 23:17:25 電車や車の中で聴く音楽が嗜好。
6968 2018-09-01 23:17:20 Oh noooo, that sounds bad. No, this was just a glob of oil the pan spat out. I rinsed it with cold water and put aloe on it.
6969 2018-09-01 23:17:07 Day 2 at farmers pike fest. Two more days to go. Diffusers and CBD oil stock dwindling fast! A quick shout out to thisecwho have ordered off etsy the last few days, I will fill those orders and ship as soon as We get back to the shop.

6974 2018-09-01 23:16:33 Castor oil for thickness
Coconut oil for strength and shine 
6975 2018-09-01 23:16:16 Probably because their life expectancy is shorter.  What does that have to do with coconut oil (good saturated fat) vs. glucose (carbs/sugar) for brain fuel?
6976 2018-09-01 23:16:12 self charging by burning oil inefficiently. #bollocks
6977 2018-09-01 23:16:07 was just swimming in the ocean and my leg got covered in OIL like one of those baby ducks from the BP oil spill becuase there are OIL refinery’s in the ocean off the coast of california IM SO UPSET and i can’t get it off
6978 2018-09-01 23:16:03 Cleaned the inside of my car, got an oil change, now getting a car wash 
6979 2018-09-01 23:15:50 Wait, you do know edible oil products aren’t petroleum based, right? #stupidityknowsnobounds
6980 2018-09-01 23:15:49 I'm glad you're okay. When I was training to be a chef I got hit by a lot of oil, a big male chef picked me up and got me to cold water so fast it only hurt rather than scarred and blistered. Burns are no fun.
6981 2018-09-01 23:15:43 The Motley Fool used to be respectable. Now its just clickbait hucksterism that sounds a lot like door to door salesmen selling vacuum cleaners to unsuspecting housewives. What's next, you purveyors of snake oil? A traveling show in a covered wagon?
6982 2018-09-01 23:15:40 Which oil and vinegar?
6983 2018-09-01 23:15:34 Nice. I could see some of that and also truffle oil.
6984 2018-09-01 23:15:33 Authentic Truth Peaces Men’s Africentric Peace & Power jewelry sets are 75-100. Wood beads are soaked in extra virgin olive oil for sensitive skin. All original and one of a kind. I Never duplicate a Peace
6985 2018-09-01 23:15:20 Thank you. And that is one reason why gold can never get the proper place it deserves. It’s emotional appeal makes it hostage to snake oil salesmen.
6986 2018-09-01 23:15:19 They gave too much away and then oil prices went down and it destroyed them. Fact of the matter is like you've heard a hundred times socialism is great until you run out of everybody else's money.

7002 2018-09-01 23:13:21 Pretty good! The only thing I've been doing is using beard oil and brushing. I'm not interested in minoxdil, and I'm pretty happy with the natural growth I'm seeing.
7003 2018-09-01 23:13:19 You'll lose a lot more if you just give America the oil. That's what Trump is after, a way to strip you of it, so once again he gets something for nothing, and when you say anything , he'll block you.

7008 2018-09-01 23:12:33 I always loved that the "Lost Station" secret level's only objective was "Locate a powerful weapon" and the SSG was that very weapon. The sound design for it, as it was for all of the weapons, was so loud and abrasive. It simply fit the gritty oil and blood soaked atmosphere.
7009 2018-09-01 23:12:30 I used to be a marinara-on-my-ravioli kind of girl. Now I’m a expensive-olive-oil-and-grated-cheese-on-my-ravioli kind of girl. This is the wisdom that comes with age!
7010 2018-09-01 23:12:30 Today's shocker...dropped off my 2012 Nissan Altima for an oil change & brake fluid.  The car is serviced regularly and has only 31,000. Miles.  The tech called me to say I need new brakes, new tires, and A NEW TRANSMISSION for $6700.00!  Apparently Nissan transmissions are crap!

7013 2018-09-01 23:12:00 And let us know how that's going for you when you run out of fresh water and lumber...oh, and all that oil you love so much that we ship to you to be refined. We can build refineries too , dude. And then there are all those natural gas pipelines....go DoTard!
7014 2018-09-01 23:11:51 And then at the same time.. basically all of Alberta's money is made by selling oil to the U.S. ... so your largest taxpayers are going to lose all of their income and then what will happen?
7015 2018-09-01 23:11:49 No, but you must direct cash to groups that will secure flow of oil and gas to yourself and your allies.
I suppose it’s your job Mr President to weigh up which is better, a shitty deal or energy security.

7021 2018-09-01 23:11:12 Ah. I assume that means it’s wall paint. Wall paint is either Latex/water based or oil based. Oil is more expensive and dries slower, so I’m betting it’s water based. If so, your mom is right. Soap and water and some elbow grease.

God, Your throne is eternal;
  You will rule Your kingdom with the scepter of justice.
9 You have loved what is right
  and hated what is evil;
That is why God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness and lifted You above Your companions.

7035 2018-09-01 23:08:57 Just needed to nick a bit more of Syria. Then export the stolen oil as their own. It was always a ruse to get stolen oil and legitimise it. None of them would waste a penny unless it turned into a pound. Shame for the investors who spent pounds for a penny.
7036 2018-09-01 23:08:45 If Alberta oil is so dirty, then the Federal government should stop receiving dirty oil derived cash transfer payments from Alberta! Not allowed to build safe pipelines but we will take Alberta’s dirty oil cash transfer payments. Can’t have it both ways.

I have seen your tweet about unpaid oil import bill inherited by NDA govt from UPA II. And more of huge subsidy burden...

The point however is both simple n glaring :

Why did / does not your govt bring out a White Paper on the state of economy inherited in 2014 ?
7042 2018-09-01 23:08:04 Since you bought olive oil ?
7043 2018-09-01 23:08:00 I stopped taking my sleeping pills a month ago because they make me shaky and I always feel hot. I was doing really horrible about sleeping so I started taking them again and guess who’s shaky and hot all the time. And my vape broke so no cbd oil

7059 2018-09-01 23:04:42 It’s not the use of oil in manufacturing that causes climatechange but the burning of it. 

All those things can be manufactured using energy from renewables. Plastics and other parts can still be made from oil without impacting the climate.
7060 2018-09-01 23:04:31 If it’s likely to be so devastating to them perhaps it’s time the neighbouring oil rich Muslim Arab countries helped them.  Funnily enough they don’t. Egypt blockades Gaza. They take EU money and build tunnels and rockets.
7061 2018-09-01 23:03:41 Mister @FLGovScott the big problem is Cuba, they are the source of the communist and the money came from Venezuela, please cut all the purchase of oil and get out the boliburgueses from Florida...

7096 2018-09-01 22:59:39 It is people on the left who are never satisfied no matter how much govt will do to make oil extraction environmentally safe. The left needs to just shut up and support a good govt in a positive way. Otherwise prepare for 10 more years of cons. You are the ones making it happen.
7097 2018-09-01 22:59:19 I'm listening to lofi music, have my oil diffuser on and just finished my kombucha...

7099 2018-09-01 22:59:00 This makes a lot of sense, especially for countries that import a lot of oil. Assuming they can generate electricity with non fossil sources.
7100 2018-09-01 22:58:42 Last time I looked Westminster was still helping itself to Scottish oil with the full approval of the Scottish electorate. 2014 made Scotland the laughing stock of the world.

7101 2018-09-01 22:58:36 Canada can export its oil, lumber, steel and aluminum to Europe and Asia. It dosen't need to sell its raw materials to the USA.  And Canada can partner with other car international manufacturers. Never again should all its eggs be put in one basket.

7110 2018-09-01 22:56:57 India imports more than 2X over what it exports. Our biggest import bill is oil. There’s very little we can do to influence the $. In fact a stronger ₹ actually helps our trade deficit & balance of payments a/c. Maybe @elonmusk can save us by setting up a gigafactory

7149 2018-09-01 22:51:08 Take in refugees to keep them from destabilizing the neighborhood, and then let the Venezuelans figure it out for themselves. It's actually US courts that are dismantling the oil industry. We could easily feed the starving and restore stability with a bit of investment.

7169 2018-09-01 22:47:35 be that as it may, when fresh cutting fries, you MUST soak them in water to get rid of the starch and then do a first fry at like 300-325, take them out and let them cool while the oil heats up to 350 for the final fry to get them fluffy inside, crispy outside
7170 2018-09-01 22:47:30 just popping in to say that dill, sea salt & olive oil triscuits are really fucking good
7171 2018-09-01 22:47:25 And oil spills.
7172 2018-09-01 22:46:58 The oil companies have known they were were speeding up climate change for almost 100 years and they kept it a secret to make profit, much like big tobacco knowing their product caused cancer
7173 2018-09-01 22:46:56 Been rubbing coconut oil all week. These beards better connect in 2 weeks before I meet this girl smh
7174 2018-09-01 22:46:36 I feel like you’re stressing about not stressing which is making it worse? .. is this why you asked about black seed oil btw
7175 2018-09-01 22:46:32 "Jobs?"
Like your employment is a benefiction of some oil company who's threatening to leave if they don't get it exacty their way? All you company men who carry water like this instead of sticking up for yourselves deserve the shaft you've got coming.
7176 2018-09-01 22:46:23 But what if china priced Sun Tzu manuscripts in oil and converted the proceeds to gold for trade with Iran- few are talking about this and fewer still understand the consequences for the dollar
7177 2018-09-01 22:46:22 my optimism is at least as plausible as your pessimism. if we just put one oil company out of business, that would nudge people away from fossil fuels. then they realize how much better life is without fossil fuels, so they outperform the holdouts. and so on.
7178 2018-09-01 22:46:11 I grew up on The Mediterranean diet inspired by the eating habits of Southern Italy.

7188 2018-09-01 22:44:37 The North is greatly endowed with untapped natural resources. Crude oil is killing us. There's no single parasite state in Nigeria; studies have shown. The parasite idea is only in the subconscious of the ignoramus. Restructuring empowers the people. Its the way to go. #SMACKDOWN

Also Americans : can we get 1m likes to support our troops that carpet bomb locations, killing innocent people (and some of the enemy) in the name of war and oil
7191 2018-09-01 22:44:27 Anyone who has ever worked with oil paints please hmu
7192 2018-09-01 22:44:15 You’re right Mr President, we do know where you stand. You’re buying our oil at around 50% off/barrel + you’re complaining that you are the one being ripped off. As far as we are concerned up here, you can take your whinny attitude and shove it!! #ableg #cndpoli #yeg #USPolitics

7194 2018-09-01 22:44:09 This what happened, nearly 30 yrs ago, the west specifically the arm sellers, got new clients like ME with promised unlimited oil to shower themselves. So they moved their attention & evil arms  and absolutely destroyed the ME by selling their arms & stirred civil war...
7195 2018-09-01 22:43:24 please release the #CPC donor list. it would be interesting to see how much money you're taking from oil and energy interests. in the interests of fairness and to avoid a charge of hypocrisy.
7196 2018-09-01 22:43:13 型月魔術世界での日本の扱いとは………？やはりガラパゴってるんです………？
7197 2018-09-01 22:43:09 "The region is peaceful, desolate, serene and empty." 

No. It was decades ago. Oil and gas industry production, processing, pipes, trucks, toxic soil "treatment" both sides of frack waste-sprayed road leading to "scenic overlook" through thick smelly methane.
7198 2018-09-01 22:43:07 @fordnation Stephen Harper had good values and a smat man. When PM he could have taken care of business a hell of alot more. The money was even..could bought up so much hitec equipment and advanced medical equipmnt. Just worried about oil. What a missed opportunity.

7200 2018-09-01 22:42:53 It’s a shame that these people are being led by a snake oil salesmen & can’t see that this was a final message from @SenJohnMcCain urging us & warning us to protect our democracy. I have very different ideologies than Him, but he was a war hero, statesman & a true patriot!
7201 2018-09-01 22:42:46 Canada destroyed our oil industry?

7203 2018-09-01 22:42:25 Use clove oil! It’ll provide temporarily relief.
7204 2018-09-01 22:42:21 Nust be careful GOP deniers dont switch at the right moment and stand in line a oil bailout.  They did it with the financial collapse and they will do it with climate.  They were allowed to get away with it in 2008.
7205 2018-09-01 22:42:13 Got some Yankee Candle oil for my oil diffuser and it’s on point right now!
7206 2018-09-01 22:42:06 Need to smell the hot oil to really get it
7207 2018-09-01 22:42:02 People go on about oil as if its the only thing we rely on. The Tories are desperate to keep us for lots of things but especially whisky revenues. Its worth a kings ransom to them.
7208 2018-09-01 22:41:48 Have to admit!! Shitting it over tomorrow so i polished off 2 glasses of wine mixed with 9 drops of CBD OIL. Zzz zzz  In Brendan we trust
7209 2018-09-01 22:41:47 Can we get more female representation in the garbage collection and roofing industries? How about oil rig workers?
7210 2018-09-01 22:41:35 You’re welcome. Like I said I use buttermilk instead of milk, and Crisco in place of liquid veg oil. I mean it’s liquid after you melt it.
7211 2018-09-01 22:41:25 Agreed. Forward thinking, innovation, very necessary, but not at the expense of the resources that are going to fund our ingenuity! Without an oil industry paying for research and innovation, it will be impossible to move forward. "Shooting ourselves in the foot! "
7212 2018-09-01 22:41:23 My thoughts exactly. No more fresh water no more hydro , no more oil . 
Question is can Canada become a self-sustaining country?
7213 2018-09-01 22:41:13 Or say "Nein" to wars for oil & arms manufacturers ?
7214 2018-09-01 22:41:12 The Blitzkreig was financed by American industrialists. The German war machine ran on Ford engines & aviation fuel supplied by Standard Oil. IBM supplied the systems for cataloging the Jews & other people exterminated in the camps. #NeverForget
7215 2018-09-01 22:41:10 Very lovely way of eating beans.
Myfood timetable.
I cook beans and stew separately,eat first next I add palm oil & drink garri with it separately,next eat ordinary beans and then this way. School life is 
But this beans at d left scary as looking into my hostel toilet.
7216 2018-09-01 22:41:08 Vegan version: ‘Things’. My favourite ever egg on thing was baking an egg on leftover roasted halloumi with peppers, sweet potato and adding chilli oil. Mm.

7226 2018-09-01 22:39:39 Peppermint oil and failing that peppermint tea or ginger tea
7227 2018-09-01 22:39:15 The only person that ever said NAFTA was a bad deal is you you keep saying these words like remember we know it's a bad deal no it's not you're getting the better of it you owe us money. We will keep our trees oil lumber everything we give you we don't need you you need us.

7237 2018-09-01 22:38:19 Get your doctor give you a thyroid test just in case. CBD oil has also been a godsend. It does take time to find the right strength, titration & method of delivery. Before I got sick meditation helped the anxietty to I've been meaning to get back to it.
7238 2018-09-01 22:37:49 We have Democratic election but we are a republic of the people ... except with our leftover  IRS FBI DOJ EPA... we are the sovereign of this country... not congress... they have a 16% approval... and should be boiled in oil
7239 2018-09-01 22:37:47 This is due to the US sanctions. All because the US wants Regime Change for OIL as usual.

7243 2018-09-01 22:37:09 Given that the trend towards alternative energy seems inevitable, I consider it borderline treasonous to continue pushing oil and coal, while the rest of the world moves ahead of us. Shouldn’t we be trying to innovate this market, instead of impede it?
7244 2018-09-01 22:37:03 Pizza!

Instead of sleeping, I am watching italians roll dough, burn them, crisp them, oil them, and make love to the final product with an orgasmic 'Ohhhhhh'.. #loveforpizza #sponsormytriptoitaly

7246 2018-09-01 22:37:02 Oil is ruining the planet    plastics are ruining the planet.  More damage has been wrecked in the last 100 years then in the past 100,000. There are alternatives!   Every one  will benefit.

7250 2018-09-01 22:36:49 Hmm. Interesting. At a fundamental (entropic?) level, I think that's almost certainly right - though rather deep down the 'stack'.

The 'engine' analogy's not a strong one - I was playing against "oil" quite a bit, though not flippantly - but maybe the new 'medium of (ex)change'?

7253 2018-09-01 22:36:36 For £1.50, buy a bag of fresh Kale, rub in coconut oil. Spread on a baking tray and season with salt. Bake at a medium temp (180 ish) for 10-15 mins. Pop portions in Tupperware and you have the same effect for less and nicer 
7254 2018-09-01 22:35:56 Rent paid. Oil change done. Fridge full. Wine poured

7258 2018-09-01 22:35:33 After all these months @chigrl - I still don't see your opinion on oil settlement supported by information. 

Please provide data or primary source info to support your postings re. why Russia and China aren't moving to #PetroGold #OOTT
7259 2018-09-01 22:35:21 3/n China is now well-positioned to be a market maker in oil and products basis Shanghai. Pricing would be in dollars with FX conversions & settlement in Yuan. Role of gold will be limited to collateral for delivery counterparty risk
7260 2018-09-01 22:35:15 Let us be clear we don't refine our own product so you're probably using the same oil We ship raw import the finished product #cdnpoli
7261 2018-09-01 22:35:03 I had a similar issue, if you wear foundation I would change to oil free, same with the moisturiser. Affordable side, Boots Good Skin day cream and higher end, Origins oil free cream :)
7262 2018-09-01 22:34:54 Like when a Govt pays private investigators to snuffle around in citizens rubbish bins on behalf of oil interests, that kind of creepy you mean?
7263 2018-09-01 22:34:36 Ajax Amsterdam, own money, not owned by US billionaires, not owned by oil sheiks or Russian oligarchs, plays with proud Ajax players. Players who are not owned by the money. Players who are free to choose. That is Ajax Amsterdam, a proud club with proud players. And we are back.
7264 2018-09-01 22:34:28 Like my lil dawg @Been_A1 would say “y’all boys ain’t got no oil “ 
7265 2018-09-01 22:34:00 I read that wrong. What else is new. Lol
7266 2018-09-01 22:33:50 If I’m pan frying I use evoo as well but I was going full on unhealthy by using the deep fryer so it’s usually peanut oil. 
7267 2018-09-01 22:33:43 imagine bragging about inventing the class of software with one of the largest attack surfaces, an industry that arguably amounts to little more than snake oil

7275 2018-09-01 22:32:10 The Scottish currency will be the one people buy our oil, gas, whisky, salmon ,beef, lamb, water and surplus energy from. Plus loads more!

7277 2018-09-01 22:31:52 i know dandruff shampoo with baking soda works! but it makes ur hair superrrr dry so i recommend doing a coconut oil mask before and after :)
7278 2018-09-01 22:31:35 Oh please given? Taxes are not gifts and your oil isn't free and doesn't go east. Alberta is without question shafted by Confederation as it stands separation is the route to take
7279 2018-09-01 22:31:35 Oil!
7280 2018-09-01 22:31:34 Facts are facts  fossil fuels = climate change = wildfires, drought, floods. Not rocket science. Just science. Oil industry must eventually die so that the planet can live. It's just that simple.
7281 2018-09-01 22:31:25 Yooo I’m at subway rn and the lady in front of me deadass just asked for toasted bread, cheese, oil and ranch....

Civil Defense in #Tripoli launched the alarm sirens from the location of the oil tanks near the airport road in the capital as a result of several shells fall on the site, warning of a disaster in case of hit the fuel tanks .
7285 2018-09-01 22:30:36 Oil and lots of freight this summer. Most are 4 engines per train, double stacked with containers. Even saw and heard some of the new engines, but rare to see one hauling grain @CNRailway
7286 2018-09-01 22:30:24 We didn't oil but will definitely do so next time. (They were still good of course)

7290 2018-09-01 22:29:19 Heated my oven to 450° before I realized I stored dirty oil in a canister in there a day or so ago 
7291 2018-09-01 22:29:16 That's an oil producing country hence the cheap price.
7292 2018-09-01 22:29:03 Lmao... Yea... Red hot, red hot extra hot, siracha, and Asian hot oil... They all serve their purpose...
7293 2018-09-01 22:29:00 A girl with huge natural hair sat next to me in the movie theatre. Now it smells like coconut oil 
7294 2018-09-01 22:28:51 That's a great article, but it's sad she skipped over oil. They buy our crude for less than 1/3 of the OPEC price ( and in our dollars not greenbacks) and that goes if NAFTA goes.  Canada can then sell to whoever is willing to buy it at a price we decide.
7295 2018-09-01 22:28:49 Not really. Canada does not have a significant industry other then lumber and oil that we dont want to drill. It would be a good idea to start investing and lowering taxes and wage conditions and put sanctions on foreign goods in order to bolster some industries in Canada.
7296 2018-09-01 22:28:32 @JustinTrudeau I am sorry for the behavior of our elected officials in Washington, D.C. I suggest you incrementally raise the cost of crude oil from your country until the oil industry here south of the border forces the 45th President of the U.S.A. To behave. Just my 2 cents

7300 2018-09-01 22:28:20 Second the ravioli. Kids get it with olive oil & cheese, probably some carrot sticks on the side. We have it with pesto plopped on the top in the bowl, cheese and a handful of rocket if it's in the fridge.

7303 2018-09-01 22:27:34 I have no idea why anyone would want to get on a plane with a sign on the door that said, ‘10% probability of crashing’. That’s what big oil has us doing in 2018. Manufactured consent keeps us misinformed and on a path toward humanity’s extinction. I wish you well on our journey.
7304 2018-09-01 22:27:13 Saudi Arabia is politically stable with neighboring Arab states ,and its policy is aimed to achieve safety and stability in the kingdom and in the Arab state region. Also it has prosperous economy according to availability of Oil and Gas in the  K.S.A.
7305 2018-09-01 22:27:00 Regardless of where you live, the oil and gas industry supports every public school and community across the great state of New Mexico!
7306 2018-09-01 22:26:55 Supposed to took Ky to get a haircut and get a oil change ... nothing happened cuz he sick 
7307 2018-09-01 22:26:50 now i'm wondering. an idea popped into my head of a dark steampunk world where the oil is some kind of god blood type substance and burning it for fuel is polluting reality on a metaphysical level and turning the world to fuck in a cosmic horror kind of way
7308 2018-09-01 22:26:50 Can we not romanticise George W. Bush's administration? The admin that launched two unjust wars, responsible for the deaths of over 200,000, torturers of innocents, lover of oil companies and denier of climate change, promoter of NSA spying on everyone?
7309 2018-09-01 22:26:46 Hardly. It’s all about anti-Trump resist and obstruct. 90% need to go
7310 2018-09-01 22:26:24 They had lots of ways of making dough. CIA George owned Zaoata Oil and Bell Helicopter, for example and they were traditional toadies to the Rockefellers and Harrimans and that came with “tips.”
7311 2018-09-01 22:26:19 Sheeeesh yu ain’t get yal oil changes or somethin?
7312 2018-09-01 22:26:18 Y'all I did my first dramatic Smokey eye look only to be seen by the people who did my oil change. I don't deserve this treatment 
7313 2018-09-01 22:26:12 TH is on that arc fighter planes take when the engine is leaking oil, & it's starting to smoke.  Which brings Arthur Gustavo Malzahn's name to the fevered lips of some UT cognoscenti, good Tejas boy that he is, & that job his self-described "dream". (1st task:  beat UWa)
7314 2018-09-01 22:25:36 I think that we should stop using the term "energy sector" when we talk about oil&gas. Call them the oil&gas industry or the fossil fuels industry. Renewables are part of the energy sector but I double they share the same concerns as the oil&gas. #energy #TransMountain
7315 2018-09-01 22:25:26 THANK U SM!!! I’ll look into that ASAP aaa, rn I’m going to start using natural stuff like coconut oil but I’ll try and get some of those products soon!! Bless u Tysm for the info
7316 2018-09-01 22:25:11 Outcast Diary #1113. "Never mind," said Milt. It took me offguard when the key quit squealing like a medieval gauntlet dragged across an oil drum and suddenly slid out. I should've shot backwards and collided with Reece Shearsmith's bookcase, but the bookcase was no longer there.
7317 2018-09-01 22:24:59 4 eggs separated
1/2 cup coconut oil melted 
5 tbsp coconut flour
2 tbsp milk of choice
1 tsp baking soda 
1 tsp sweetener of choice (optional)
1 tsp mixed spice or cinnamon (optional)
The trick is to whisk the egg whites to stiff peak - makes for the fluffiest pancakes. YW
7318 2018-09-01 22:24:59 airing tf outta my house and have all the oil diffusers on lmfao
7319 2018-09-01 22:24:55 I think I don't smell like neem oil now its stuck in my senses
7320 2018-09-01 22:24:54 The flow of arms will keep going so long as they have oil.
7321 2018-09-01 22:24:47 If the truth be known City got lucky that oil billionaires in the form of Sheiks from the UAE whilst Utd were bought by The Glazers. Various figures suggest that Utd have lost upto a billion to pay back Glazers loan during which time Utd have used their own money to finance ...
7322 2018-09-01 22:24:42 No. Oil exporters don't have to sell oil for any currency. They don't have to accept FX risk. If Argentina wants oil, it will have to obtain dollars.
7323 2018-09-01 22:24:42 I just gave my boys an olive oil bath and let me tell you, 2/3 of them were so unhappy with it that they would squeak at me to get me to stop
7324 2018-09-01 22:24:30 What a fucking day. Full blown panic attack from 8am till like 1. Then realized my fucking kitten got out through a window, found him after an hour searching, covered in oil or something, gave him a bath, and now trying not panic again. But let’s go bsu.

7327 2018-09-01 22:23:52 Republicans are owned by American Billionaires, Saudi Royals and Russia Oligarchy. This is about about $ and oil. Trump is a distraction for business as usual which allow global mafia to continue to traffic drugs, guns & girls. Russia and Saudis need sanctions lifted to sell oil.
7328 2018-09-01 22:23:47 By “We” I meant here in Toronto/Canada.  And by “very soon” I meant in the next few months or so... 

Banks/Oil/Gas/food prices will increase. Loss jobs, unemployment & etc....

Basically it’ll just affect the middle class not the douchebag 1%
7329 2018-09-01 22:23:41 Who just burned their arm with hot oil, you ask?

Me. That was me. Ow.
7330 2018-09-01 22:23:06 Are u serious? Kaplers losing his mind too much coconut oil
7331 2018-09-01 22:23:00 the fact that I paid $114 for these bullshit nails... first off they used a brush that was obviously not clean and REUSED to put the cuticle oil on...which made my skin break out, AND these bitches already lifting.... I want my mf money back!!!!
7332 2018-09-01 22:22:57 Hi 
How do I get your products. Really need castor oil and peppermint then vitamin e oil and rose water
7333 2018-09-01 22:22:46 They lied offering many free things. People bought it because "free is good". Until the oil prices went down and there were no more business to milk.
Now the regime gives one bag of food per family per week (and it's not free)
7334 2018-09-01 22:22:42 Lord I Thank You For This Costly Oil......I Paid A High Price To Receive This Oil....But I Generously Pour It Out Upon You, Nothing Else Matters But Pleasuring You Thank You Jesus My KING

7337 2018-09-01 22:22:34 Love cannot endure indifference. It needs to be wanted. Like a lamp, it needs to be fed out of the oil of another's heart, or its flame burns low.

7339 2018-09-01 22:22:30 I don’t full agree. The LIbs need to complete the consultation requirement to get this one done. But my support for this pipeline is only on the condition that it’s proceeds fund the economic transition away from oil and gas to renewables. We don’t need more pipelines.

7342 2018-09-01 22:22:07 I have no contempt for city dwellers not am I bitter about my circumstances. Back to the basic point. We still need oil and our Canadian oil industry is still the best on the planet  we need to use our own, sell our own &  buying from SA, Venezuela, Qatar etc.
7343 2018-09-01 22:21:50 MSM is not Murdoch's biggest earner.
Shares in such war-for-profit ventures as Genie Oil and Gas are.
7344 2018-09-01 22:21:29 can wait to wash my hair tomorrow and put a fuck ton of oil in it uwu
7345 2018-09-01 22:21:19 This stuff is wild. Picture the smell of coconut oil once you sniff it

7348 2018-09-01 22:21:02 Being married is great because while I slept  Payo took my car to get an oil change, washed  and filled up my tank 
7349 2018-09-01 22:20:47 So do the Rockefellers. The same oil family that also buys Canadian oil at a discount of $30/barrel because we can’t get it to Tidewater.
7350 2018-09-01 22:20:39 Spring started this weekend so I just spent an obscene amount of money on grooming brushes, sprays and hot oil treatments for the pons . Now all I need is a hot sunny weekend to make them sparkle.
7351 2018-09-01 22:20:38 Now I know why I've been seeing @keevaorganics Tea Tree Oil Acne Cream all over Facebook and Instagram. Cuz it actually works! I've been using it for just two days and my acne is pretty much gone!

7353 2018-09-01 22:20:30 FFS Norway has a population of 5 million people and produces 2 million bbl/day, while Canada produces 3.6 million bbl/day.  BTW Norway gets twice the price for their oil cause they can ship it by tanker, whereas Canada blocks AB/SK oil.  See the difference.
7354 2018-09-01 22:20:22 Fast way to bring in Russia  and China  against the USA  AND cause world chaos while drastically inflating oil.
7355 2018-09-01 22:20:20 Oil was destroyed in 2010 with end of energy trusts - flaherty ans the banking lobby
7356 2018-09-01 22:20:20 why the fuck they sold Alaska to us for $7mil and there be maaaad oil there 
7357 2018-09-01 22:20:02 Using gasoline in a feudal apocalypse is stupid. there's no way to refine the oil. I imagine an arms race of self-made combustible oils. corn syrup, alcohol. Lots of primitive designed engines will do. We're not trying to make Racecars. a basic Ford from 1920s will do
7358 2018-09-01 22:19:47 PMB hs No oil well,No oil bloc,no private jet,no private university,no mansion,no estates,no political thugs,no private library,no foreign residence, no foreign bank accounts No private company.Only PMB hs this unbreakable track records among  d ruling class.

7361 2018-09-01 22:19:37 Still recovering from the fact that someone put extra virgin olive oil on the turf.
7362 2018-09-01 22:19:32 Yeah, I’ve been bought out by big oil like you’ve been mind f’d by Suzuki. Doesn’t sound reasonable does it.

7364 2018-09-01 22:19:27 Someone asked me my opinion on Doctor Strange. I said 'It's like chili oil for jews'. #DontJudge
7365 2018-09-01 22:19:22 @JimHarris Thanks Jim for the follow. I do love your points on AV & EV that will destroy lots of industries like Oil, ICE cars, insurance in 10 years from now on. That’s why  #Tesla is facing backslash from #shorts & #haters. They do scare to be devasted soon.
7366 2018-09-01 22:19:16 To be fair, there are currently many pipelines that transport millions of barrels per day. This one was to expand capacity to allow oilsands expansion. It’s not like without this pipeline all AB oil production shuts down.
7367 2018-09-01 22:19:07 During my internship at Murphy Oil Corporation last summer, I reduced the cost of flexible electronics
7368 2018-09-01 22:19:04 2. JOJOBA OIL 
I’ve used this before and it’s not as strong as other oils but it is still good for controlling the sebum on your skin. If your skin has too much sebum, your pores could get blocked = breakouts. Jojoba oil prevents that! ( £9 - $7)
7369 2018-09-01 22:18:57 Great idea. Who is paying? If we turn off all the oil and gas tomorrow where will we stack the bodies? Canada contributes 1.6% of global GHG. How do we get the other 98.4% to stop? Wind and solar just aren't technologically advanced enough yet so what is the energy alternative?
7370 2018-09-01 22:18:57 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?
7371 2018-09-01 22:18:53 Does coconut oil lemon juice and baking actually remove hairs? If so I'm going to try it lol
7372 2018-09-01 22:18:42 getting an oil change that’s SUPER overdue & feelin like i’ve reached my adulting limit for the year
7373 2018-09-01 22:18:40 hot condom oil... smh
7374 2018-09-01 22:18:22 c) And in his tweet, Mason SPECIFICALLY singled-out oil sands oil, exclusive to all other sources of oil. He did not generalize about ALL oil; and thus endorsed them via omission. That is misleading or uninformed at best; possibly just dishonest.
7375 2018-09-01 22:18:08 if I apply coconut oil to my bank account will it make it grow
7376 2018-09-01 22:18:07 BC should start doing what the majority of its citizens want and support the effort of the Feds and the rest of Canada to get the oil to tidewater.  Andrew Weaver should go back to his life as a professor who can say and do inane things without consequence.
7377 2018-09-01 22:18:01 1/n I used to manage deliverable IPE (ICE Futures) Gas Oil contract & cash settlement/EFPs etc of Brent. I came to know forward & futures energy markets backwards. Shanghai oil contract - like all commodity futures - is not about delivery: it's  about pricing forward contracts
7378 2018-09-01 22:17:44 As soon as there is no demand for the product, it’s done. You’re looking at 50-100 years to get off oil. Why squander what we have now instead of taking advantage of it? Use our natural resources to build a better future.
7379 2018-09-01 22:17:27 The oil exporter will accept any currency. The challenge is to make your currency acceptable. Safe and secure savings, the opportunity for investment.

It's not easy, of course. So in some sense you have a point.

But oil is not denominated in US$.
7380 2018-09-01 22:17:27 @glossier just bought a body oil wash at your LA store. I get open and open it and it’s a quarter empty!!

7386 2018-09-01 22:16:28 Ok ! So they placed honey and oil in bottles of wine and cigarettes to defame PPP..Now I get it...khan jee kahaan se layain hain
7387 2018-09-01 22:15:42 We’ve been screaming this from rooftops. @FairQuestions has devoted years of investigative journalism following the money. This even includes the RockefellerS who, at the same time are funding these groups to stop a pipe to tidewater, are also buying heavily discounted CDN oil
7388 2018-09-01 22:15:04 So you understand that we are selling our oil at a highly discounted rate to the US because we don’t have anyway to export it. We’re losing Billions of $ that we could be investing into green technologies. Not having this pipeline is environmentally irresponsible.
7389 2018-09-01 22:14:49 Bcuz of past health issues doctors said I was never going 2 have children. I prayed & prayed. God in HIS timing, answered & in my 30s I had not 1 but 2 babies. Like Samuel's mother, I took them 2 church, had them anointed w/oil, & dedicated them back to God. They're now 19 & 17!!

7396 2018-09-01 22:13:33 had almost a full tank when it died same with oil
7397 2018-09-01 22:13:26 The dirtiest oil in North America is from the Placerita oilfield near Los Angeles.  Did you talk to the Americans about closing that place down?
7398 2018-09-01 22:13:23 It does that now. 98% of oil is shipped in to Canada. Almost none comes from Alberta directly to Canadian pumps.
7399 2018-09-01 22:13:09 You know how much I trust the universe? My oil change light is on and at 5%...and I’m still running errands lmao
7400 2018-09-01 22:13:08 So beginner kit I say start with a)cleanser meant for your skin type b) proper foundation (unless you have perfect skin cheap ones tend to cause acne) c) oil makeup remover - highly recommend Tatcha Pure as they support communities with each purchase and 0 makeup left behind
7401 2018-09-01 22:13:00 And we all have biases. @BlairKing_ca lists his position in detail and I have yet to see a single rebuttal to that work beyond things like "shill for big oil". Which is telling about the biases you bring to these conversations.

7412 2018-09-01 22:11:57 Short term it will hurt
But if we diversify...
Our resources
Oil.. lumber...water...potash etc
Has value
People seem to think Canada lives in a continuous igloo lol

Wrong
7413 2018-09-01 22:11:57 An Oil producing country in trouble?

Yeah. That's America's version of a girl with daddy issues. We know it'll be bad for us, but we just...can't....resist.

Seeing as we still havent completely broken up with our last 2 wars, why not take some "me time" and work on ourselves?
7414 2018-09-01 22:11:48 The US was primarily built on a gold money system.

All gold does is stop the inflating away of debt (and thus prevents debt bubbles).

7417 2018-09-01 22:11:28 Putin offered Trump $500M if he got him elected. That is why he campaigned 18 hours 7 days, waived salary & last minute hush affairs. Even buy his own taxes. Let P. sell $11B Rosneft oil to Qatar. Sale went through early Dec. 2016. P. got $5B for reelection and 45 got 10%/$500M.
7418 2018-09-01 22:10:48 Hahahaha! Bullshit! The big bad oil industry you did nothing to help now you’re going to do something with 7 months in office?!?! Nice last minute vote grab. Oh and thanks again for my incredibly high taxes on utilities. #notgoingtovotendp
7419 2018-09-01 22:10:41 Please. It's good that you said no. I mean, you're a handsome man, but all I wanted back then was to add oil to a burning fire. It wasn't about you, it was just about me and what I wanted. And I wanted to use you
7420 2018-09-01 22:10:39 Don't get me wrong. I'm not coming out in favour of oil spills. But it just seems weird that the least safe, most expensive, and most carbon intensive transport alternative is the only one available right now.
7421 2018-09-01 22:10:37 Uh. They have oil. Duh.. precursor to kinetic action.

7428 2018-09-01 22:10:05 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
7429 2018-09-01 22:10:04 It's the equivalent of the UK government talking about the fallout of north sea oil reserves and policy, with Scottish west coast communities, more so than those more directly affected on the east coast. It's truly bizarre. They are flying so blind.
7430 2018-09-01 22:10:04 You have a fair point however the traditional High St has really gone & I think the term needs removing because the expectation is 'Shops' yet most are in Shopping centres or OOT . Vibrant Spaces or locally based names are much better going 4ward
7431 2018-09-01 22:09:54 Lol..... okay..  actually left lag... 5years ago though.... anyways nice havn u bruv....
7432 2018-09-01 22:09:44 かいさんおはようございま！
7433 2018-09-01 22:09:30 Depends if you enjoy illegal wars, debt and suffering of ME people for oil, money and elite greed?  What has American taxpayer gained by 4 million dead in 11 years? Obama was Bush - same person different mask.
7434 2018-09-01 22:09:17 Did a hot oil treatment on my hair , babes cooking gumbo and the kids are out playing ... feet kicked up watching greys anatomy #washed
7435 2018-09-01 22:09:11 What screw-up? The world oil price drop was not #Notley's fault, nor were the decades of entitlement and economic mismanagement of previous #Conservatives.
All economists agree that best way to reduce carbon is to price it and let people make market choices to reduce it.

7436 2018-09-01 22:09:09 No. I really don't care. Frankly she should be use to it by now. She knew he was a snake oil salesman when she married him.
7437 2018-09-01 22:09:03 Omg who's canola oil
7438 2018-09-01 22:08:53 Why won't u call for the war to stop , don't let the Europeans make you look bad as a leader call a press conference to talk to the whole Cameroon nation and the world, this war is about the natural resources oil and gold , Africa is getting rape and murder by Europe.
7439 2018-09-01 22:08:30 I haven't noticed a difference since he left and at least Charlie Strong isn't a giant Ass hole Snake oil salesman.
7440 2018-09-01 22:08:28 tank full , new tires , oil changed  I need at least my money for my gas and oil change back 
7441 2018-09-01 22:08:26 Oil of cloves.  See Marathon Man!
7442 2018-09-01 22:08:17 If there already is proper oil in the tank when the wrong kind is added, the engine will only limp and sputter along.
7443 2018-09-01 22:08:04 I would've taken anyone but her or Canola Oil
7444 2018-09-01 22:07:51 I turn around and see jeremy rubbing oil absorbing sheets on his hair
7445 2018-09-01 22:07:38 She uses Moroccan oil shampoo and conditioner. That’s what I use and it’s very expensive. The best stuff I’ve ever used. ( I’m a hair dresser)
7446 2018-09-01 22:07:18 I only remember cause my mother in law making me oil down 
7447 2018-09-01 22:07:10 Do you want to order CBD oil or Black Seed oil and save $25?
Comment Yes Below!
7448 2018-09-01 22:07:07 I'm so confused by this bad guy. Who is he? where's he from? why is contraband in extra virgin olive oil? Why is staying with this nice lady and her innocent children? Why stalk the guy from the bank right now? SO MANY QUESTIONS #jackryanamazon #JackRyan @primevideo
7449 2018-09-01 22:07:06 I’ve been seeing a lot of talk about CBD oil so obviously I need to pick some up.
7450 2018-09-01 22:06:58 Sorry - oil won't be price in gold in your lifetime - based on what? @chigrl 

Perhaps you have a plan to stop China, Russia and the other oil producers from reverting to pre-1974 #PetroGold pricing system.

#OOTT #Oil #gold #China #Russia
7451 2018-09-01 22:06:26 2015 amendments to the Transportation Act & Rail Safety Act established that a railway company is liable for environmental damage from oil transportation and are required to have a compensation fund to pay for it. But oil companies still aren’t required to clean up well sites
7452 2018-09-01 22:05:59 That’s not the point of it.  Wont equate to gold, it’s not about gold - it’s about the USD.

If/as CNY contract builds volume, with CNY oil and CNY gold, China can control the int’l trade value of the USD, & by extension, China’s own commodity Balance of Pmts.
7453 2018-09-01 22:05:45 I work in a smallbiz were we use online platforms & it certainly isn't easy. Having it though helps us to drive & build our physical store, so our face to face relationship is secure & local shoppers are supported,as are we by them. A lot of people find us because of the E sites
7454 2018-09-01 22:05:41 They do have the Not With Standing clause. But @JustinTrudeau and the #liberal party are Pussies and to crooked cause the oil companies won't pay them off.
7455 2018-09-01 22:05:30 #RaisingTourettes I’m very curious as to if any of the kids on this show have ever tried CBD oil? It helps people with anxiety, depression, it helps stop seizures in children, even the shaking in someone with Parkinsons.
7456 2018-09-01 22:05:22 can someone please throw some switch cartridges in a pan with some oil on a stove i need it for a post
7457 2018-09-01 22:05:10 Fired for taking big oil bribes while at Tech
7458 2018-09-01 22:05:02 I don't buy that argument. The price of oil, for example, is quoted for historical reasons in US$ per barrel. Just because thats the convention doesn't mean that's the currency on the invoice if you buy oil (which is not a futures contract).
7459 2018-09-01 22:04:58 im trying to level my fletcher squad cause i'm basically out of oil
7460 2018-09-01 22:04:47 ...But 'Nigeria is a cooperate organisation in which #Brexit #Britain is a major shareholder'.... the most populous black "country" in the world...The fourth largest oil producer exporting #Biafra 's petroleum.
7461 2018-09-01 22:04:38 I know there is one here in town where I live but we need more of them to refine our own oil so we are not exporting it for pennies and buying it back for dollars. It is foolish.
7462 2018-09-01 22:04:36 Thanks!  I got some  Balsamic Vinegar!  I’ve had this before and it’s great and half the price of Napa Olive Oil.
7463 2018-09-01 22:04:31 Before 2014, CBD Oil was just as illegal as flower Marijuana in Alabama. 
Now we have a protocol for CBD and research showing it works, plus parents won’t get charged with giving narcotics to children when giving them their medicine. Alabama should expand on that!
7464 2018-09-01 22:04:29 No no - go for Nuxe Huile Prodigiuese - it’s MAGICAL dry oil that you can use on your face, hair and body. And it makes you smell delicious. I have dry skin and I swear by it.
7465 2018-09-01 22:04:24 Oil cursed it.
7466 2018-09-01 22:04:21 Tries to wipe an oil stain off his face, ends up making an even bigger mess of himself.

Sighing in disappointment.
7467 2018-09-01 22:04:05 Yes there are failures on two levels of government with regards to our oil industry.
7468 2018-09-01 22:03:46 You know he fun times are when the coconut oil is solid 
7469 2018-09-01 22:03:46 I actually thought @adekunleGOLD will cut his hair in his new music video DELILAH.
7470 2018-09-01 22:03:44 Are you kidding? When Dubya kicks the bucket even people who were chanting “no blood for oil” are gonna eulogize him the way they did with McCain.
7471 2018-09-01 22:03:38 Gawar ek baari jake k crude oil ka price v pata kar le may2014 ka aur aaj ka.
Chutiye bhakth!!
7472 2018-09-01 22:03:37 They’ll get jobs when agribusiness takes over the wilderness. Eg palm oil. Then they will be supportive of Palm oil. Wild animals never got to vote. Ain’t democracy grand.
7473 2018-09-01 22:03:24 a) He specifically mentioned "ethics" ; there is more than simply an environmental component to the ethics of oil consumption. Some Canadians are putting  gasoline in thier vehicles sourced from the world's most despotic regimes, rather than that produced by other Canadians.
7474 2018-09-01 22:03:16 Unfortunately, our markets are so closely integrated, we'd be hurting ourselves too. I'm pretty sure a lot of the oil we send them comes back as gasoline, diesel, and heating oil.
7475 2018-09-01 22:03:13 I’m going to experiment with inventing my own salad dressing recipes and use low calorie replacements for oil. I’ll start with a cilantro lime tomatillo dressing. It will have way less calories than ranch does. Two tablespoons of ranch has 140 calories. That’s insane.
7476 2018-09-01 22:02:55 Love your blog! I definitely need that tropical oil you have bc I don't tan at all 
7477 2018-09-01 22:02:45 BOI HUH? You know nothing about that struggle. At least you have chicken grease? I was about to take this rent money and put all $3.75 in your tank. I gotta put lawnmower oil from last year mixed with water in my tank

7480 2018-09-01 22:02:22 We shall not be surprised why Rockefeller got out of oil industry. 

It is like You own a huge portion of Bitcoin shares and start to dumb the market slowly after price exceeds 16.000

7482 2018-09-01 22:02:10 True and I totally expect this to a another dumb decision by an oil man trying to play football GM
7483 2018-09-01 22:02:10 That's definitely a possibility, isn't it? I wasn't thinking about the oil.
7484 2018-09-01 22:02:08 I read somewhere baby oil or something I dunno cleans them but I can’t find where I found it and nothing else works
7485 2018-09-01 22:02:05 Dogs, what's the point of them and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.

7490 2018-09-01 22:01:05 Put it this way..oil still trades in USD ..regardless on China contract..still equates to USD ..call me when it equates to gold ...wont be in our life time..Cook is right
7491 2018-09-01 22:00:59 Things I need to do: clean my room, go to the store, get my oil changed, get a car wash, do the dishes... 

And where am I? Laying in my bed.

7494 2018-09-01 22:00:46 Mix 4 cups Black Beans with 4 cups yogurt. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Boil. Serve with salmon
7495 2018-09-01 22:00:45 I have always felt the true trump meaning of 'drain the swamp' actually meant to steal as much $$$ as possible. It was never about people or too much government, it was always about land, mineral/oil rights, cash & more cash... That's their SWAMP ... to steal as much as they can.

7502 2018-09-01 21:58:45 Hey @Alisa_M_Ramirez what is your favorite essential oil I really need to know it’s for research pls and thx
7503 2018-09-01 21:58:33 Come back to the car,and theres a puddle of oil on the ground. Not a good sign
7504 2018-09-01 21:58:23 OIL
7505 2018-09-01 21:58:18 My guess is that there will be much burning of midnight oil right up to the deadline, culminating in the usual sort of declaration worded to please all the people all the time, followed by 20-30 years of haggling over what it actually means.
7506 2018-09-01 21:58:13 Came to get an oil change today and they better not tell me nothing else.
7507 2018-09-01 21:58:11 Worked out early in the morn, went out to eat with the family, and now just waiting for an oil change :-)
7508 2018-09-01 21:58:08 Noel Gallagher thinks Liverpool fans are deluded coming from a fan of a club that won fuck all until oil  he should try make a decent record something he hasn't done in 15 years
7509 2018-09-01 21:57:51 No loans come with more underlying interests than that of IMF. Did you know, that of the entire amount of oil explored in Kenya, only 15% is owned by the state? More than the loans, it is the leverage we loose with it from international financial institutions
7510 2018-09-01 21:57:36 Geez, I save at least that every month in gasoline since we replaced our oil car with an electric one thanks to the EV rebate you’ve now killed! I guess clean energy is still cheaper than subsidized fossil fuels! I think you’re going the wrong way here Doug.
7511 2018-09-01 21:57:21 How about we take you out our great lakes and stop taking our water, and taking our lumber and oil. And also taking our soliders lives for helping in wars your country started so who really is the one abusing the trade agreement and relations.
7512 2018-09-01 21:57:15 The whole #Syria'n war is about oil!
Remember the US uses up to 20.5 mil barrels a day, and produces 14.86 mil barrels per day. It has to import 7.5 mil barrels a day just balance that fact.
The Pentagon uses up 1.5 mil a day! Let that sink in!

7524 2018-09-01 21:53:38 This is how Trump's  USA works  though. Putin and Kim will keep them in wheat, oil, water, gas, and I'm sure they will be the first ones there to help in the case of another 9/11, Katrina,  Sandy, etc. Canadians can stay home and watch

Sorry not taking tips from somebody who thinks eucalyptus and tea tree oil are dangerous but thinks nothing of using bleach 
7527 2018-09-01 21:53:08 We used comb outs and oil (8 hours hair fully coated in oil to drown any adults left after thorough comb out) and it worked way better than nix and rid did even in the 80s when I was a kid. And it didn’t burn our scalps
7528 2018-09-01 21:52:58 I had errors in the previous reply, but this was the point I was trying to make. 

"While transporting oil by rail results in more spills, incidents via pipeline typically result in releasing more barrels of crude oil into the environment, research from..."

7534 2018-09-01 21:52:33 Depends on whether they were coconut oil or avocado based, healing properties versus cosmetic... but probably yes.

7562 2018-09-01 21:47:22 The U.S. imported $144.2 billion in oil from Mexico and Canada which enabled us to have lower Fuel prices. NAFTA lowered food prices in much the same way.

7570 2018-09-01 21:46:04 Let us all watch the black smoke billow out of the five locomotives moving that oil over the Mountain and then back down again throwing the retarders on so it does crash. If ya miss a day there's always the afternoon or tomorrow. @SohiAmarjeet is a loser.
7571 2018-09-01 21:46:02 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
7572 2018-09-01 21:46:00 TOTALLY WRONG! The US abuses Canada! In fisheries, softwood lumber, aerospace (Boeing!) and OIL is sold at INCREDIBLE DISCOUNTS!  The #FAKEPRESIDENT is wrong and spreading MISINFORMATION! SAD.

7576 2018-09-01 21:45:25 I apologize if that's what you thought. No - it was an honest question and liquid transportation fuels. I didn't mean to imply ANY association with "big oil" and def not conspiracy crap. I'm more of a scientist and interested in the long term outcomes. Global change takes decades

7583 2018-09-01 21:44:06 You can defo use any oil that's safe for you. Ive seen olive oil based margarines in stores here but not sure about the us. The oil is there for just a bit of a richer texture but it really isn't necessary :>
7584 2018-09-01 21:44:04 They don't care .. There's no oil involved
7585 2018-09-01 21:44:01 We will start with our natural resources. Water, gas,, oil, lumber. And your next  disaster USA? Don't bother to look north for help on your next 9/11,Katrina,Sandy, etc We will be busy

7617 2018-09-01 21:38:35 Well, they’re not, are they?  They are just antagonists, they pour oil on troubled waters.  They do not speak for us.
7618 2018-09-01 21:38:31 @KatiePhang 

I'm sorry. Did I miss the part where thousands of brown people, children, etc. had their lives destroyed by our establishment political system. Over oil and other natural resources?

A photo OP wipes that away? Interesting.
7619 2018-09-01 21:38:31 GOP has moved away from Rep Joe Barton of Texas when he apologized to BP CEO in the wake LA New Orleans oil spill disaster congressional hearing:” I am ashamed of America.....” Google him.
7620 2018-09-01 21:38:20 But since it might break the monopoly of the oil companies, it wont be allowed
7621 2018-09-01 21:38:17 Mass refugee flight, an increase in oil prices, and a humanitarian crisis in the country. All of which are less expensive than an invasion and occupation.
7622 2018-09-01 21:38:06 I’m pretty sure an essential oil peddler just followed me because my story has a diffuser in the shot
7623 2018-09-01 21:38:01 Absolutely true. And the guy 2 seats to his right told Canadians they should keep their oil in the ground while presiding over the largest growth in US production in history.
7624 2018-09-01 21:38:01 Hi Mr. Jimboman, I've been following your tweets and am impressed with your fractal method. I don't understand it however it looks scientific.  Do you see more upside on WTI this week or would you say this rally is done? Thanks

7630 2018-09-01 21:37:25 What a crock, the NDoPes have brought in encore activists, put them on important boards and done everything possible to slow down and stop our oil industry. Hollow words from a desperate woman who's head is on the block!
7631 2018-09-01 21:37:17 A whole lot more. The new wind projects in Alberta bid in at record low rates. They are getting us out of coal. And no, they didn't fire teachers and nurses during downturn only to have to rehire at inflated rates when oil recovers. It's called smart government 
#Abpoli #Alberta
7632 2018-09-01 21:37:06 White American chiming in after watching many of her Christian women friends get drawn into the essential oil MLM crazy for similar theologically fuzzy reasons. Seems like there's similar blurred lines. Would be good to think about them in parallel.
7633 2018-09-01 21:36:44 James Polk was pretty bad...he started a war with no motive other that conquest.

That's if anything, worse than a war for oil.

He rates much higher now because he added half a continent to the country, but that is how he did it. By threatening Great Britain and crushing Mexico.
7634 2018-09-01 21:36:41 Just curious Jonathan. There’s conventional oil from Alberta & Newfoundland & I believe Saskatchewan. Tar sands outputs something like (hand waving) 1/3 to 1/2 of Cdn oil but wants to grow. Cda’s position on that chart should be both better & worse. But thx, not worth more effort
7635 2018-09-01 21:36:41 Why test BOTTLES? WHY NOT take blood samples of Mr.Sharjeel Memon & reports will reveal if his ‘HONEY’ & ‘OIL’ was genuine..!!

7636 2018-09-01 21:36:32 The darker the oil the harsher it might be because the darker the oil the less it was filtered. It could still get you high but try to by ligh colored oil and hen make sure they not selling you cbd oil saying it’s thc oil

7639 2018-09-01 21:36:10 Not true. We get 98% of our oil from the US. What comes from Alberta is shipped to refineries in the US as we have only 1/2 a refinery in Alberta capable of processing bitumen. All the oil we use in Canada is foreign oil.
7640 2018-09-01 21:36:07 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.

7648 2018-09-01 21:35:04 It thins your blood, thins your skin, can cause birth defects, causes very dry skin to the point where it will start peeling, and it basically just stops your oil production all together and can take up to 6 months after you stop taking it for your oil glands to return to normal

7661 2018-09-01 21:33:26 I imagine it's heavily invested in CP Rail and CN Rai stocks. And perhaps some US based oil companies as well. For every loser, there is a winner. Somebody will sell oil to the world, it just won't be us. One should check into that.

7665 2018-09-01 21:32:29 You are a victim of a disinformation campaign by vested oil and gas interests, as well as being ignorant and or in denial of the vast majority of scientific consensus as well as overwhelming empirical evidence. Or, more likely, an evil schill.
7666 2018-09-01 21:32:21 Do you not understand how trade works? Do you know how much oil is supplied to the US every single day? 33.3 million barrels. Every Day!
But, hey, if the US doesn't need oil we can sell elsewhere! It's only 41% of your needed supply. You'll be fine.
7667 2018-09-01 21:32:08 What am I supposed to do with all this snake oil?
7668 2018-09-01 21:31:57 I use olive oil and greek yogurt face products, I eat it by the liter, and look at me. Look at me.  I'm old as shit and I have the supple succulent skin of a golden god.

7681 2018-09-01 21:30:02 I know vegans will keep asking why it's not vegan, i'm more interested in whether they contain any Palm oil?  Many vegan/vegetarian products seem to contain it despite the animal cruelty and deforestation implications.
7682 2018-09-01 21:29:59 Prov & Fed Govt’s have never dealt with Native land claims in BC. Perhaps this decision will inspire a conclusion to land claims
Harper was unable get Alberta oil to tidewater in 10 yrs. That you expect PMJT do in 3 yrs what PMSH couldn’t do in 10 is unreasonable or hypocritical.
7683 2018-09-01 21:29:56 Right, more economical. Partly because, you know, Omnitrax didn’t maintain the railway and your guys sold the wheat board to....the Saudis... Your guys in Alberta have suggested using that port for oil. So, there are uses for it but you say “fuck them” because it’s a small town

7687 2018-09-01 21:29:26 This is a lie of course, as often times Bob is saying that about an article or video he's RTed. But as we've known for decades, Republicans and honesty go together like oil and water. From "I am not a crook" to "There was no collusion..."

7691 2018-09-01 21:29:06 Bizarre how flip flopping is villified in politics when people changing their opinions is normal and often good? Like as long as the opinion is 1. good and 2. not the result of a bank or oil company telling them to do it it's all good, right?
7692 2018-09-01 21:29:06 I agree it needs to be built or our economy bottoms out.  Quebec buys Oil from Saudi Arabia and that’s wrong but local

7705 2018-09-01 21:27:34 So basically you saying, #SharjeelMemon is Sooo pooor, he could not find a regular off the shelve bottle of imported oilive oil, so he probably bought this GG bottle from some "Balti Paper wala" and then had it filled from some low grade local olive oil from some "Purchoon shop"?
7706 2018-09-01 21:27:28 I will talk to you about my country,

US and France gave aid to the government what weapons, from 1990 until now, nothing else

7713 2018-09-01 21:26:02 Before getting on your soap box “gmac” try reading some facts. The study compares avg salaries across all jobs. So the avg salary of an oil rig worker v secretary. Gee, I wonder if there will be a gap!? Women take lower risk jobs. They also choose less overtime.

7724 2018-09-01 21:25:03 The overthrowing of the prime minister of Iran, Mossadegh by the CIA and the British MI6 because of the nationalization of the Iranian oil industry. Basically it was imperialism atn its best and certainly not done by librarians or graphic designers. It was the work of spies.

7737 2018-09-01 21:23:03 Health care system is like a an oil company telling you which car to buy, what gas to use and how many miles to drive. Once you enter the system the sellers have near total control over what you buy, where you buy it and how often you buy it.  What else works like that?
7738 2018-09-01 21:22:52 The feminazis are all about equal outcomes. They think secretaries should be paid the same as jobs where men risk their lives like miners and oil rig workers. They don’t want to put themselves in danger, but go to the nail salon on lunch break and get paid same as top CEO.
7739 2018-09-01 21:22:50 Coconut and coconut oil are in everything now, even soup. I'm never going to shift this winter weight
7740 2018-09-01 21:22:41 Sadly no, cause oil isn’t made from dinos. It was formed from organisms that came before them. Cool meta thought though.

7747 2018-09-01 21:21:37 Lorrie  these Trudeau fans don't realize Trudeau and his over regulation is what caused this. Remember Trudeau thinks oil sands should stay in the ground. How convenient he can pass the blame.

7750 2018-09-01 21:21:00 Both countries had and have many allies. Why are you singling out Israel? Who supplied SA with its oil? Don't worry she'll play Russia and China, and you won't find any BDS supporter boycotting the Bolshoi. No Israeli Jews to blame.

7754 2018-09-01 21:20:48 I said “with oil probably”
7755 2018-09-01 21:20:48 Right but my oil isn’t owned by Trump, neither is my food and I get my groceries from a farm (worth the 45 minute drive) also, Trump names are coming down because these business are losing money, because boycotting is real, if you want to make a statement you hit someone’s pocket
7756 2018-09-01 21:20:43 Ok so if you kill NAFTA, you know Canada is no longer required to ensure the US a consistent supple of oil to the US??  Which the US gets at a price discounted from the global oil price.  So do the math, 38% of the oil you import is from Canada.

7802 2018-09-01 21:13:36 HDA still snipes away in this piece, she just recognises some savvy moves.

7805 2018-09-01 21:12:45 Mash is usually pretty easy, just use plant milk (unsweetened and without a strong flavor) instead of cows, and melted margarine or oil instead of butter. I usually add garlic salt (or whole roasted garlic), a bit of paprika, pepper, pinch of nutmeg and chives to mine.

Those who have to travel for a living or who live more than 15 min from work with no transit, don't have that choice.

7838 2018-09-01 21:07:51 If I worked at the oil rigs the only thing I would want to buy is a Tesla.
7839 2018-09-01 21:07:45 I have some GOOD oil free stuff to share with you actually
7840 2018-09-01 21:07:00 The fact that, after 150 years, the US still hasn't invaded Canada for our oil kind of disproves the US-as-greedy-imperialists myth.

7843 2018-09-01 21:06:27 Ok, ok. There’s a lot of nonsense here. Who said I was American? I work for the Canadian Briadcasting Corporation. Fish are vegetables? Who said that? All the fish oil I’m eating must be ruining my brain. I don’t get it.
7844 2018-09-01 21:06:23 This from the guy who dog whistled that McCain was a racist and whose minions implied he was too old and soft in the head to be President in ‘08. Ok....

7851 2018-09-01 21:05:41 He must have split personality, or some type of personality disorder, being able to leave his girls in those oil drums like that. Just sickening. Then go BACK to the scene a day or so later and bury Shanann and Nico.

7854 2018-09-01 21:05:21 Its gross looking, why do we have to put meat on every single dish.  Pizza is about crust, sauce and cheese, then you add some little bits of flavor like basil and spicy oil
7855 2018-09-01 21:05:07 tea tree oil 
7856 2018-09-01 21:05:01 And it's not really being billed as reduced-fat so much as "less added oil/fat in cooking" but babies need fats for brain development (among other things).
7857 2018-09-01 21:04:44 Man City? Effing seriously? About as far from The Packers as you can go. Great team bought with oil money in the last decade not built. Five 1st Div/ Premier titles since 1890..three of those in the last seven seasons.
7858 2018-09-01 21:04:43 Oil... always about oil

7861 2018-09-01 21:04:21 In fairness if Man City weren't conceding Mr Dunnes 10 own goals a season back in the day they'd have got closer to fulfilling their potential without the oil money

7876 2018-09-01 21:02:35 About USD INR, we all know that 69 is less than 71; so USD INR 69 means a stronger rupee. Rupee valuation depends on multiple factors like forex inflow, prices of global commodities like crude oil or heavy machinery, fiscal or monetary policy, import export, global economy etc.

7881 2018-09-01 21:01:34 Coconut oil while its cold/ frozen just bite it like candy till it melts and let it swish around your mouth (not exactly like mouthwash) for 20 minutes.
7882 2018-09-01 21:01:27 I used to wear Versace Blue Jeans all the time, but went back to Aromatics Elixir cos it’s so ‘eccentric old lady’. I really like these tho! Flowery twee shit is horrid - although I do still own and love Dewberry oil ;)
7883 2018-09-01 21:01:13 But they won't stop drilling for or selling oil. Those are some principals.

7887 2018-09-01 21:00:48 No. He said coconut oil (and palm oil) may increase your LDL (bad cholesterol) levels and increase your risk of heart disease. If you are not at risk for heart diseases and treat coconut oil like any other fat/oil and not as a FOOD in and of itself, you'll be fine.

7895 2018-09-01 21:00:18 What about olive oil and Canola oil?
7896 2018-09-01 21:00:12 And folks who have worked on both sides of the border have told me that Alberta's oil and gas regulations are much better, and better enforced, than some US States. @politicalham would know more about this than I.

7898 2018-09-01 20:59:57 OIL  : A lubricant that reduces friction between moving parts.  Also can be used in cooking.  You can rule out the cooking by a sick man in a hospital.  So which parts of the anatomy was he lubricating?  Million Dollar Question,   #SarjeelMemonSaga
7899 2018-09-01 20:59:47 Yup sure. All that fuel burnt to broaden the pollution and carbon footprint that so many uninformed bitch about. Makes as much sense as oil tankers sailing 14 thousand kilometres to NB refinery. 1 trip exceeds pollution of all cars globally. Retarded mindset
7900 2018-09-01 20:59:38 Thanks for the offer but I think you should keep it. Soak it in Danish oil and it will make a fine garden ornament. I think it’s a flying goose 
7901 2018-09-01 20:59:19 Speaking of the tincture, I keep hearing there is a shelf life on cbd oil, is there? And if so how long!? Should it be refrigerated?

7905 2018-09-01 20:58:15 Whale thing, lots of them on the east coast too. Tankers have to reduce speed out there somewhere. My point is that it’s ok on the east coast for Saudi Oil coming in, but no good on the west for CDN oil going out? Why don’t we just build energy east and reduce tanker traffic?
7906 2018-09-01 20:58:08 thats about as aero as an oil tanker #poorpinning 8 pins minimum

7936 2018-09-01 20:54:24 I would rather see convoys of trucks hauling the crude oil to the coast. That should put a lot of qualified fluid haulers to work.

7941 2018-09-01 20:53:26 Graphs are great, no denying climate is changing, how does that change people's behavior of wanting and using oil and gas. So far it hasn't. Alternative price competitive choices will.

7945 2018-09-01 20:52:49 Kinda like I felt in the darker parts of Detroit when my work took me there yrs ago.  Pretending this only works one way gets pretty old. Humans can have bias, period, and until this is truthfully and equally exposed I doubt much will change.
7946 2018-09-01 20:52:37 2/2

Idea:
Joint the edges following the grain including the sap wood.
Add addition pieces of some less valuable timber for width either matching the sapwood or contrast by ebonising or even "black-lacquer". Oil finish on the center plank of course.

It's all about "anger and fear in the oil patch."

7965 2018-09-01 20:49:43 I have a huge heart for people, sometimes I buy homeless folks lunch. Conversely, people working in the oil industry are trying to feed their families. Once we no longer require fossil fuels for anything, then maybe we can get pious? The irony here is not lost, right?

7972 2018-09-01 20:48:35 Your facts are quite out of whack , not all of AB/BC oil is bitumen we also have huge plays of ng. I was referring to importing PV but I guess cargo ships bringing them in are okay traffic right?

7974 2018-09-01 20:48:27 Who's the one that was boiled in oil?
7975 2018-09-01 20:48:05 Other oil rich/dependent countries have diversified. Saudi Arabia is very oil export dependent BUT they, as most ME countries, exert control over markets, whereas Venezuela does not. V's economy is 95% dependent on oil exports, so when oil falls, the country falls.
7976 2018-09-01 20:48:01 like same tho
7977 2018-09-01 20:48:01 OMG !  The only reason this is happening is because donnie & his gang want Venezuela is because of it's oil! Remember he used to say that he would've taken the oil in all our wars.We are not out of Afghanistan because he found out there are valuable minerals to mine. Follow the $
7978 2018-09-01 20:47:55 And I work on Both of them! ADLs problems when the buses are first delivered are chaotic if its not oil leaks, its water leaks, then Air Con Leaks. Not to mention one of them is currently not dispensing Ad Blue. The Boris's i work on have this problem 3 years on.
7979 2018-09-01 20:47:38 The average North American uses 26 barrels of oil/year 10 for food, 9 for transportation, 7 for everything else (anything synthetic made from oil) the biggest user of oil is conventional agriculture, 10 calories of oil & nat gas/ 1 calorie of grain or vegetable
7980 2018-09-01 20:47:26 ALL the things listed , but for a bit different, try Korean style! Slice into sticks, sprinkle with salt, squeeze out in 10 min. Stirfry and add sauce (2T soy sauce, 1t chili flakes, 1minced garlic clove, 2t sesame oil), sprinkle chopped scallion/sesame seeds. Boom.

7982 2018-09-01 20:47:07 It’s very bad when a rambunctious Oil Patch Brat like me has to take time off from fooling around to start prodding the Federal Government to straighten up and fly right.

7984 2018-09-01 20:46:35 As long as we are pumping oil and gas in record numbers, energy is not a factor.
7985 2018-09-01 20:46:26 I travel from Sokoto to Usman Dan fodio University,d land laying fallow alone is greater than 2 states in South East,my question is why can't we invest in agriculture.
Oil made us lazy.
7986 2018-09-01 20:46:26 Life-changing tip: rub olive oil and and salt on your potato before you stick it in the microwave
7987 2018-09-01 20:46:17 Cool... But what makes oil spills bad is how it affects the ecosystem. All human spills have done at least some damage to the ecosystem.
7988 2018-09-01 20:46:14 A bajillion points ahead if only Blair was still here to lead us into illegal oil wars.
7989 2018-09-01 20:46:06 Good use of oil and Honey.
7990 2018-09-01 20:45:58 Are people really out here thinking banning plastic straws is doing anything to help the environment. If you wanna help the environment then at least like nationalize oil companies or something. It's not that hard :)
7991 2018-09-01 20:45:57 STFU!
Talking like you're living in Dubai or inside Ngamia One Oil well

You're just a bitter escapist;Now that Rao is also in Jubilee is he going to shield you from inflation?

7998 2018-09-01 20:44:40 I worked there right in the beginning when he started to mess with the oil refineries. All good engineers were fired and replaced by cronies. Oil companies left and lost a fortune. They still can not run them more than 30 % capacity. The writing was very clearly on the wall.
7999 2018-09-01 20:44:33 No more wars for oil.  Trump doesn't give a shit about the Venezuelans.  He hates latinos.  He just wants their oil for big oil.
8000 2018-09-01 20:44:31 More space taken up by cars (roads, parking etc) even its hydro, palm oil, biogas powered. Land is a scarce resource
8001 2018-09-01 20:44:21 She is a snake oil salesman. Women empowerment is just a brand to her.

8008 2018-09-01 20:43:14 Think he has any idea where Venezuela is? He probably thinks it's in the Middle East because they have oil.
8009 2018-09-01 20:43:05 When @dsdemo13 puts the pine oil in the air diffuser & all of a sudden it smells like Christmas
8010 2018-09-01 20:42:57 HEADS UP Trump Admin wants to drill 4 oil &frack on 1.6 million acres of fed land across my home( Santa Barbara),& Ventura, SLO, Kern, & neighboring counties!Parcels include along HWY154, Santa Ynez Mountains, in Carpenteria as well as...
8011 2018-09-01 20:42:55 @cattaneooutwest 2/2 You had an agenda as a lobbyist for the oil industry in disguise as a reporter and thank goodness we have our courts to show Canadians how biased you have been
8012 2018-09-01 20:42:21 Our friends at #JohnLombardoRacing hosted a great event for a great cause today in their pit area at #USNats for #HoosierBurnCamp. Many racers stopped by to for autographs and the kids all had a good time. #MAHLE #USNats #TheBigGo #Indy @ Lucas Oil Raceway

Slice and coat in flour, drop in batter and deep fry in hot oil!
8014 2018-09-01 20:42:09 I think it might be time for an oil change;.
8015 2018-09-01 20:42:02 the north isn't a parasite. it just appear that way . they have vast potential . every corner of the country can is blessed uniquely. we just lost focus and attended to oil only.
8016 2018-09-01 20:41:33 Have you tried utikizing endoflex oil? It is good if your thyroid is under active which is the case with mine. Clary sage as well.
8017 2018-09-01 20:41:32 I wish! She is too gutless and does not care about the oil industry but only now pretends to get votes. If she cared she wouldn’t have hired anti pipeline activists on her staff
8018 2018-09-01 20:41:30 Reading shows NAFTA possitive for all 3 countries but less for USA as trade a small part of GDP. Loss of it would mean Canada not forced to supply US with oil & gas and could meat Paris accord commitments and loss of meat and corn trade to Mexico so shooting self in foot again.
8019 2018-09-01 20:41:10 A messsss okay. Used all my coconut oil and DO NOT CARE 
8020 2018-09-01 20:40:54 
8021 2018-09-01 20:40:54 One sliver lining of the NAFTA negotiations is giving Central Canadians and others a taste of how Albertans feel when our Oil & Gas & Coal Industries are attacked by buffoons.
8022 2018-09-01 20:40:51 American Oil industry.  They fund the protesters in Canada to cripple our ability to get our product to market therefore increasing the value of the their product international.
8023 2018-09-01 20:40:51 Thats how I change the oil.
8024 2018-09-01 20:40:45 Lol kin Kai @Itz_OmaaaR gida kenan
8025 2018-09-01 20:40:45 Your country is screwing Canada on the price you pay for our oil.  USA is treating Canada very badly here.  You don't seem to want the enery security from Canada so I hope you lose it.
8026 2018-09-01 20:40:41 Clove oil. And cover the exposed area with gauze, cotton, wax or even chewed gum to keep air from hitting it.
8027 2018-09-01 20:40:28 …ｽﾔｽﾔ
8028 2018-09-01 20:40:15 But but but Spencer if Drew is elected he’s gonna raise the Gross Production Tax to 7% or even 10% and the oil and gas companies are gonna leave and TAKE THE OIL &GAS WITH THEM! Everyone knows those companies take it when they leave!!!!

Sorry I had to do it.

8031 2018-09-01 20:40:05 You can't list rolling back regulations to protect our environment and job safety as accomplishments.  Maybe in your world you're okay with pollution, fracking, coal mining and oil drilling in national parks but, that's called regression and not progression.
8032 2018-09-01 20:40:00 Lol everywhere, depending on d hustle position, but Oregun now.
8033 2018-09-01 20:39:54 New product line by Vodka. Honey and olive oil juice for those who cant afford expensive ones.

8036 2018-09-01 20:39:30 Actually, oil accounts for less than 5% of the Dubai's revenue. You are wrong.
8037 2018-09-01 20:39:14 I dunno. He did almost start World War 3 by using an attack on our country as an excuse to go for a re-do on his daddy's failed oil war. But I mean I guess if we ignore all of the innocent lives of Americans and Middle Eastern people that were lost for spite and greed...
8038 2018-09-01 20:39:11 A politically and economically unstable nation, sitting on oil reserves. Who knew?
8039 2018-09-01 20:39:10 Wallahi abun ya isheni,anytime I finish leading prayers someone will come up to ask permission fr alms begging, or ask for Alhaji
8040 2018-09-01 20:39:01 As a side note, getting my oil changed is really boosting my tweets per day metric
8041 2018-09-01 20:38:45 What I've learned from @LouisFarrakhan is what sublime dignity, grace & peace look like manifested in a man. It's not the seat you sit in or even where you sit that makes you who & what you are. The oil of the annointing flows down, not up #StayFocused
8042 2018-09-01 20:38:34 If your steering wheel is not covered in oil fat, then I don’t know mate @KgoshiLeopeng
8043 2018-09-01 20:38:21 Something crazy like murder a bunch of Latinos that can't fight back and own a lot of oil? Do you really think that White Evangelical Nationalists would approve of Trump doing that to distract from an impeachment? Oh, yeah... They'd totally approve.
8044 2018-09-01 20:37:57 Oil ko izaat doo 
8045 2018-09-01 20:37:43 Then Ganley -High Court over Village Magazine. Proudly stood over our claim he was a liar self mythologiser n snake oil salesman. Google Village summary of tbe show.
8046 2018-09-01 20:37:43 I always see people and articles saying stuff like skin/scalp will to adjust to producing less oil, but that's scientifically impossible. Just like closing/opening pores, letting skin breathe, and lymphatic drainage massage eliminating toxins… all nothing but nonsense.
8047 2018-09-01 20:37:38 Unn ka oil uun key merzi 
8048 2018-09-01 20:37:23 Alaskans own 172,000 shares of MIE HOLDINGS CORP, worth $16,156. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in HONG KONG.

8054 2018-09-01 20:36:53 The problem for Venezuela is oil based economy and being a victim of imperialism

8056 2018-09-01 20:36:49 Piccco is probably my fav dessert place right now. There's always something surprising and interesting. Today I tasted a White Chocolate Gelato with Truffle Oil. But the one that blew me away was a Dark Chocolate Sorbet prepared from 75% dark single origin chocolate.
8057 2018-09-01 20:36:46 There is no civil war. Like #Iraq and #Libya - America are in #Syria to steal oil, gold, land and resources.

8076 2018-09-01 20:33:55 How is it your financial responsibility?  By the way why tax credit to oil companies my fiscal responsibility?
8077 2018-09-01 20:33:52 God said so? She would never ever say such a thing! That is the problem with bible thumpers: they read into the various passages whatever suits their own views! I could find a lot of warnings about false prophets and snake oil sakesmen like the Rev. Harris!
8078 2018-09-01 20:33:48 No mess, no one should be working on my vehicle without my knowledge. Apparently there was a recall so they came to our house to repair. Imagine if something happened on my property? Resolution: one free oil change!
8079 2018-09-01 20:33:43 Did you know if you roast cauliflower in the oven with olive oil and za'atar it tastes absolutely nothing like meat but is very delicious and you can fill up on it and fart a lot?

They got 30% of our Uranium, She got $140 Million, maybe more.
Saudi Collusion with US has been since early 20th Century on Oil and politics.
8083 2018-09-01 20:32:48 Oil dey your head bro

8085 2018-09-01 20:32:47 Id rather Albertans having what we make on our oil presently then giving it to the ppl that obviously don't give a shit that we are wanting this for all cnds
8086 2018-09-01 20:32:40 Argan oil is really good so it sounds like you're on the right track. :)
8087 2018-09-01 20:32:39 Olive oil on ice cream... Yep. Nothing of concern there.

8091 2018-09-01 20:31:39 U mean they’re ghost employees of oil companies and were earning with going to office? Learn from Pathans who do labour to live with respect and don’t beg or cry
8092 2018-09-01 20:31:34 Yes it’s clear that using foreign oil and pushing our oil into the highways is the best reaction to forest fires. Absolutely clear.  Flawless logic
8093 2018-09-01 20:31:33 I'm sorry...what?? Only authoritarian dictatorships take over private companies. Oh, wait, is Ingram a Putin flunky too? He "nationalized" all the private oil companies in Russia so the rubles flow into his bank account. She needs a lesson in what a free speech democracy is!
8094 2018-09-01 20:31:33 Ah, quello che si è preso 500mila € di titoli esteri e al “popolo” (pronunciato alla Gaber) consiglia le future “canistracci oil”?

8116 2018-09-01 20:28:29 Reality is it has nothing to do with the environment, it’s all about ensuring Canada continues to supply oil to Midwest and gulf refiners at a significant discount. The environmental protesters are just the useful idiots of American refining interests.

8118 2018-09-01 20:28:27 @LordTDDD1 Don’t forget to use your inspiration vs. the Oil Monster, and remember it is vulnerable to fire. It will harass you every time you try to take a short or long rest, and slowly deplete all of your resources. THEN it will use its Legendary Actions to finish you off.

Our population 186 million, theirs 28 million. The large part of our budget is from oil, meaning most Nigerians have no stake in governance. See the non issue we are discussing here.
8128 2018-09-01 20:27:47 Time Magazine is one of many press outlets who gave voice to a demagogue who is now our President. You have him a platform because he sold your product. You capitulated to the man selling snake oil. Leave the good guys alone who are trying to undo your mess.

8139 2018-09-01 20:26:17 If you actually did your due diligence in fact finding, your have found out that oil hauled by rail has more than doubled trying to keep up with demand. We’d be better if we built the pipeline and banned hauling oil by rail. But it isn’t about environment, it’s proving a point.

8150 2018-09-01 20:24:45 Putting pizza rolls in the oven isn’t cooking. But, Melting cheese to pour over nachos; cutting up a good piece of steak to cheese or oil fondue; ordering pizza from the place down the mountain road; that’s cooking.
8151 2018-09-01 20:24:28 One of the bottles shown on tv was a bottle of grey goose vodka.

8159 2018-09-01 20:22:55 Oil whether u agree or not is a part of almost everything we use.  The difference being do we use oil that is Canadian or from another country.  I personally would rather use/buy from Canada than another country all the while helping Canada be more prosperous too!

8169 2018-09-01 20:21:26 It is a bad thing. It doesn’t need an oil rich owner. Its in need of investing the money it generates itself! It’s in need of the companies that sponsor it, to actually pay for sponsorship!

8188 2018-09-01 20:19:00 It still can be, and probably is. If was illegal then, and now, but that doesn't bother criminals.

Let me spell it out for you since you're horribly slow. 

You showed solar footprint. I showed oil spill. 

You said natural spills > man made. 

Ok... Natural unusable land > man made unusable land from solar. 

So... W T F is your point? No point.
8192 2018-09-01 20:18:51 That's what I thought about too. Talcum you can just vacuum off, oil makes for a weird conversation with the paramedics

Tax incentives create industries out of emerging tech. The oil industry is one of the most subsidised in the world. Tesla has created 30k+ jobs directly and 500k+ indirectly.

8241 2018-09-01 20:10:50 I think you mean he had his vice president do all that while he was picking his nose and letting his highly paid staff members do all the thinking for him while oil tycoons steered him and his administration to war. But I do still hate his guts.

8243 2018-09-01 20:10:36 Minister McKenna ? Are you still paling around with that snake oil  salesman , con artist  HYPOCRITE , failed presidential candidate AL GORE. You two sound so much ALIKE.
8244 2018-09-01 20:10:20 Just national gallery  It was fun. The huge oil paintings and silence inside were amazing and there were so much noise and happening outside which is a plus. Crazy fun
8245 2018-09-01 20:10:07 as a tjmaxx employee I feel compelled to inform you that you could save ten percent off your next olive oil/jellybean lunch if you sign up for a TJX rewards card.

8248 2018-09-01 20:09:50 Normally, I react to hearing or talking about about psychoanalysis like oil to water, but @Gladwell going full Freud on Elvis in ep 10 (season 3) of Revisionist History was delightful. The closing line of the ep was powerful. 
“A lesser person would have sung it perfectly.”
8249 2018-09-01 20:09:35 I need to get my oil changed 
8250 2018-09-01 20:09:33 UK are only interested in our oil and gas which they extract almost free, nothing more than that
8251 2018-09-01 20:09:31 You see, you are one of the people who don’t get it. There is a pipeline already there. The trans mountain expansion is meant to add a second pipe, following almost the exact same route. No matter what we still buy and transport oil. Should It at least be Canadian oil?
8252 2018-09-01 20:09:24 Use cooking oil works wonders to be honest
8253 2018-09-01 20:09:22 California is well aware of their oil problem which is why they have implemented bill SB 100 and will operate 100% by 2045...and likely achieving this target early.
8254 2018-09-01 20:09:19 Oh no. We've gone beyond gold. We've struck oil and are now burrowing into the earth's crust. We won't rest until we breach the gates of hell.
8255 2018-09-01 20:08:49 yesssss. we were eating the salt & olive oil on their own with our fingers
8256 2018-09-01 20:08:37 Hace varios días que no venden gas oil.hay que rogar por 100 o 200 l para el camión.como en la época de Repsol
8257 2018-09-01 20:08:30 How often do natural oil spills happen?
8258 2018-09-01 20:08:21 Yes, VicTim  you do know the arse has fallen out the oil industry ? Tax take is peanuts without the investment of the UK government. As I said, Venezuela without the sunshine. Off you pop Marlon 
8259 2018-09-01 20:08:17 I know. I know. 

Also, Mr. #butwhataboutMYfreespeech wants that no university employee says hypercritical stuff about him in private meetings. Because that's what harms his reputation (not his snake oil claims). Makes sense, doesn't it.
8260 2018-09-01 20:08:03 Coconut oil really helps rehydrate it. 
8261 2018-09-01 20:07:55 @bonifacemwangi Changamwe oil refinery closed in 2013! Sabotaged by oil barons. We have crude we can't refine
8262 2018-09-01 20:07:51 'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
8263 2018-09-01 20:07:45 It's leaking all over the place. Oil and saltwater in farmers fields are killing crops & polluting the water table, killing grazing land for wildlife & poisoning lakes and rivers. But the gov. says it's ok? FUCK THEM!!!
8264 2018-09-01 20:07:36 Thou lovest right, and hatest ill; for God, thy God, most high,

8265 2018-09-01 20:07:35 So proud of @nicoball14 for moving out & going to school in boulder, so proud of @G_Ball5 for going out of state to get an education & playing college softball, & so proud of my boyfriend for all his hard work at the oil rig doing 14 hours a day missing all three
8266 2018-09-01 20:07:25 Got to the auto shop to get an oil change and they said that it could be a wait between now and 5 ish. I see my baby on the lift now :,) God so good boy I tell you what
8267 2018-09-01 20:07:18 Because they have both oil and a reliable source of cocaine
8268 2018-09-01 20:06:52 Don't bring God into this.  Venezuela does have oil yes?  It wouldn't be the first time only the lies will be more obvious this time.
8269 2018-09-01 20:06:52 But I think coconut oil is a better lube...plus more natural . Try it out
8270 2018-09-01 20:06:44 You ain't old...just seasoned lol Just gotta change that oil from time to time :-)
8271 2018-09-01 20:06:43 This made our weekend. It makes the long days worth it. ...from a community member 
my joint pain and mobility and strength worsened this summer, and I knew it was time to investigate other options.  At the urging of one of my clients grandmother's, who was using CBD oil 1/5
8272 2018-09-01 20:06:20 I’m up! Way up. He’s the only one because he’s a criminal snake oil salesman. Have known him since I was a kid. New Yorkers know the truth. Wake up :)
8273 2018-09-01 20:06:20 Sounds like the same snake oil salesman that he was a few years ago

Body: olive oil
8276 2018-09-01 20:05:58 The smell of oil mhhhh....
8277 2018-09-01 20:05:57 Pipelines are far better environmentally than trains and trucks.  Oh no oil?  Show us the way, go live utterly without the benefit of fossil fuels.
8278 2018-09-01 20:05:40 What type of oil do you use?
8279 2018-09-01 20:05:27 No, Notlley is not selling out.  She has always understood the necessity to transition to cleaner and greener future. Alberta's economy is dependent on oil and that has got to stop. But turning off the oil industry overnight is not a viable solution.
8280 2018-09-01 20:05:23 When you bring your car to get a lil $35 oil change & end up paying $95 
8281 2018-09-01 20:05:20 Where to go in September? Tuscany? 
Fresh figs, grapes, mushrooms, chestnuts, truffles, olive oil – fall in Tuscany is a wonderful season for foodies. And temperatures are  pleasant for sightseeing. Fewer crowds too!
8282 2018-09-01 20:04:57 Seriously?! GOP wants to deregulate banks and guns and oil and schools and the environment and the internet and just about everything else. But LI wants to regulate social media?! Go away Laura! Just GO AWAY! 
8283 2018-09-01 20:04:51 Texas is filled with the smartest and most genial and most committed Dems you could ask for - and in big numbers. I always fear it’s the oil money & most Texans mortal fear of taxes (say it 3 times) that keeps the Rs lock on power.
8284 2018-09-01 20:04:45 For those who have bad anxiety I forsure recommend CBD oil!! Helps tremendously
8285 2018-09-01 20:04:15 I think one thing to point out is that the US has often contributed to the conditions in the countries these individuals are fleeing from for economic gain. eg the war on oil.
8286 2018-09-01 20:03:48 A real threat to our environment and our salmon. Not if there is another derailment but when. Ask the UFA what they think about rail by oil.
8287 2018-09-01 20:03:35 No it's hiding my oil tank 
Love working with wood
Half greenhouse next maybe
8288 2018-09-01 20:03:33 Sorry for barging in. IMHO, olive oil, vinegar and a pinch of salt is all you need... 
8289 2018-09-01 20:03:32 Sochny wali bt ye K inko Oil rkhny K lie bs Yhi bottles milti kya? 
8290 2018-09-01 20:03:07 The difference in oil price from 50$/bbl?
8291 2018-09-01 20:03:01 Victim mentality?   Well you'd know all about that being a Sevco FC supporter.  If Scotland had been Indy, then she wld have hundreds of oil billionaires.  One of them would have bought Rangers and there wld have been no liquidation.  You could have won the Champions League.
8292 2018-09-01 20:02:59 Trudeau screwed himself and Canada with his performance at the G7 trying to show the world he was a tough guy. He can't even get a pipeline built. Wait until Trump tells Canada we don't need your oil anymore .
8293 2018-09-01 20:02:57 None of those things have the capacity to destroy our West Coast. The Coast that British Columbians will have to deal with when there is the inevitable oil spill. Screw fishing? Screw tourism? Didn't think so so just shut your yap.
8294 2018-09-01 20:02:50 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=
8295 2018-09-01 20:02:40 Sleep, do a few dabs but not big ones at a time. Peppermint oil or tigers balm if you have any. If your bf is around make him run your neck and shoulders to get blood circulating. Ice packs on your head help or a hot clot on your face.
8296 2018-09-01 20:02:34 Before you buy their snake oil, check out the quackery we got here!
8297 2018-09-01 20:02:24 Listening to the Black Album. #Threats has to be one of Hov's top lyrical tracks: then lift up your whole hood like you got oil under it @JAYZclassicBars
8298 2018-09-01 20:02:23 -Grass cut 
-Non ethanol gas bought 
-bottled water and “supplies” (whiskey) laid in
-truck and wife’s truck filled up
-changed oil in generators and test run for 30 minutes 
-guns cleaned, oiled, loaded 
I’m a have me a Little drank
8299 2018-09-01 20:02:16 @Twirax but the global price for regular unleaded gas has moved to its highest level in half a decade as demand jumps and crude oil prices rise. I am available to be paid to spin this. LOL!
8300 2018-09-01 20:02:03 It’s Saturday. Time for hummus 

In food processor on high, mix together for 1 minute:

 Scrape bottom & sides.

2 tbsp olive oil
Mix high for 1 minute

Scrape sides & bottom
8301 2018-09-01 20:01:59 Forgetting something? Largest oil reserves in the world. Why not have another Gulf War : South America edition. This is worse than American Pie sequels. More money from #BigOil for @marcorubio. @realDonaldTrump has #SmallHands agreed #TrumpBaby. @marcorubio has #smallHead.
8302 2018-09-01 20:01:55 Cheer up guys!Another hunt for the dam fund.CJP will take as much donation from sharjeel memon as much he spent on alcohol aka honey nd olive oil#SharjeelMemon
8303 2018-09-01 20:01:54 our oil don't stink
8304 2018-09-01 20:01:52 Sir true talk
8305 2018-09-01 20:01:29 Say a prayer tonight for the little children of #Venezuela. The country's inflation is now at 57,000%...Food is scarce, the economy is 96% oil and prices are down. #NotForgotten
8306 2018-09-01 20:01:27 It's sad that we keep being racist and aggressive to the middle east, all because the British decided to force a bunch of borders on their people and oil tycoons saw fit to wage wars in the name of profit by lobbying greedy politicians on the left and right.
8307 2018-09-01 20:00:34 Only olive oil cake please.
8308 2018-09-01 20:00:33 Price of oil hitting higher ed REAL hard.
8309 2018-09-01 20:00:29 Buhari was oil commissioner in the 70s.  This man has to be one of the biggest thieves in NNPC. There’s no way he did not know what’s going on there.
8310 2018-09-01 20:00:29 Nah "crisis" is an understatement, we need a new word for this situation
8311 2018-09-01 20:00:21 MAGA for that oil

8314 2018-09-01 20:00:12 GOOD FATS: Avocado, Fish, Almonds, Walnuts, Peanuts, Cashews, Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Seeds, Coconut, Olives, Peanut Butter, Low-Fat Dairy
8315 2018-09-01 20:00:06 I stopped. Now I’m getting an oil change. Then taking off to Houston.
8316 2018-09-01 20:00:00 yoh when last have I had isonka dude but I just put salt in the oil with the popcorn seeds
8317 2018-09-01 19:59:58 But the cost of extracting oil is way higher in VEN than in any of their competitors (due to a lack of inversion in infrastructure mainly)
8318 2018-09-01 19:59:49 This deal is North American it cannot be processed without us and he knows it. And what do they have that we want or need and can't produce nothing but we have trees and we have softwood Lumber and we have water and we have oil. You want to go go
8319 2018-09-01 19:59:44 Kenya? They also did not have the curse of oil. To succeed in Agribusiness -a mainstay- a certain discipline and approach to quality was required. Also you cannot survive in that business with Nigerian levels of mediocrity
8320 2018-09-01 19:59:39 When enough money is at stake ANY politician or corporate officer is corruptible.
In #oil, #pharmaceuticals & #sugar there is A LOT of money at stake.
Our bodies & environment are being systematically poisoned for profit.

8322 2018-09-01 19:59:16 the industrial chili oil the big candy companies use has a really gross bitter taste i think
8323 2018-09-01 19:58:57 Horse shit.. I'd rather look at fossil fuels as a means to secure better outcomes and futures for ourselves and our descendent's. I don't buy the bullshit invented about the OIL SANDS especially when it comes from the likes of Gore and the rest of these left wing assholes.
8324 2018-09-01 19:58:51 Oh my fuckign god when I had cystic acne I was about ready to slice the next bitch who told me to “just use coconut oil”
8325 2018-09-01 19:58:48 Also I need to take better care of my hair. Some Oil Treatment here, moisture there, tlc everywhere then maybe dread locks can be an actual plan.
8326 2018-09-01 19:58:26 Lord put oil on my head like u poured on @cobhamsasuquo #AMVCA2018
8327 2018-09-01 19:58:25 heh i roast them w olive oil in a pan for like 5 min and put them on literally everything
8328 2018-09-01 19:58:23 So LNG is OK but Oil isn't?
8329 2018-09-01 19:58:14 And it’s all stolen Indigenous resources, taken without consent from stolen Indigenous land, on the backs of genocide and broken treaties.

“Ethical” oil, this is not.
8330 2018-09-01 19:58:00 Dear Trump, Terminate Nafta do it, while your at it dont trade with us either, we dont need your crap, we have the EU and other sources, you do need our timber, Fresh Water, Oil, Aluminum ect that you cant get in your country. Canada will be better off without you. Love Canadians
8331 2018-09-01 19:58:00 Soybean oil made from GE soybeans. This needs to be labeled properly and not as "non-GMO". Are we again trusting the data from the very company standing to profit? Ideally, under different laws than current US labeling laws.

8333 2018-09-01 19:57:31 Oil demand will grow for the next 50 years unless a dramatic breakthrough in alternative energy appears.
8334 2018-09-01 19:57:31 Also, there’s oil there.
8335 2018-09-01 19:57:20 Rent paid. Now time to get this expensive ass oil change

8337 2018-09-01 19:57:06 Keto tip. Skip lunch and try a fat shake:

1. 1/3 of a can of Organic coconut milk (in a can, no guar)
2. Almond butter
3. Tbsp of MCT oil
4. 1 avocado
5. Ice and water to preferred consistency
6. Dash of nutmeg and cinnamon 
7. Blend

It’s about 75 grams of fat.
8338 2018-09-01 19:57:02 Nah, forget the camels, standard Turkish oil wrestling has huge potential. I have made a small research about foreign reactions on Turkish oil wrestling, it turns out gay men and women are super into it. We should market this somehow.
8339 2018-09-01 19:57:01 Drink water.
Lather your skin in coconut oil. 
Be certain what is between you and the earth is comfortable - bed sheets, shoes, etc. 
If you wear a bra, go for a fitting. Please.
Spring for a great hair cut. 
Read books. 
Start a business. 
Mind yours.

8340 2018-09-01 19:56:57 If the previous conservative govt had not stack review boards with party loyalist and lobbyist, the situation would perhaps have been different. Ironically, the so called champions of the oil industry in Canada are as well its worse enemies.
8341 2018-09-01 19:56:35 I go to one of the quickie places when I get my oil changed so I just stop there every couple of weeks to get air.

8343 2018-09-01 19:56:23 Fun afternoon with @chibearsfan708. She dropped her car off for an oil change & hopped in with me. We hit Costco then strolled Phillips Ave. Ended with fancy ice cream from Parlour!!
8344 2018-09-01 19:56:16 The US has been lying us into war after wa after war, stealing oil, Libyan gold and happily bombing children in Yemen, but apparently upset by Syrian deaths (not Yemeni or Palestinian, only Syrian) Please just wake up, the more we are blind to the truth, the more children die!
8345 2018-09-01 19:56:14 Dare not just in case one becomes intoxicated by oil and honey as it was claimed to be in those bottles ...
8346 2018-09-01 19:56:09 In india Dollar is not used....it will only effect countries which is dependent on imports ....Its not an issue for India if India have political will to buy oil in rupee instead of dollar
8347 2018-09-01 19:55:50 Wat I did she said oil scold her
8348 2018-09-01 19:55:47 @Femiakuti we @the shrine listen to ask yourself....nah we get cocoa,oil and rubber how come we are the poorest continent...u better ask ur self ! May can not run her mouth any how and expect us to allow it to go....UK is Nigeria and Africa problem.
8349 2018-09-01 19:55:35 Oil is at $75 and demand is increasing. Flip phones were replaced with another phone not a different technology. Weak argument.
8350 2018-09-01 19:55:34 bahahaha obviously you weren't in Alberta in the 80's, or you don't remember jack shit about it. $9/barrel oil: remember that?
8351 2018-09-01 19:55:27 i was saying on the pod this week that there is no pint trying to keep up, lets just live within our means and wait it out until he gets bored or oil is $2 a barrel
8352 2018-09-01 19:55:00 I have oily hair even though I only wash my hair twice a week (trying to combat the overproduction of oil from washing my hair everyday from age 11-18) and y’all I FINALLY FOUND A DRY SHAMPOO THAT ACTUALLY WORKS
If you have oily hair Klorane Dry Shampoo for oily hair is BOOOMMBBB
8353 2018-09-01 19:54:47 Tea tree oil.
8354 2018-09-01 19:54:46 #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta @alykhansatchu @IEAKwame Kenya recently discovered commercially viable crude oil. Can't this resource be valued and used as security against our international loans?. This should leverage high interests on public loans. Just asking.
8355 2018-09-01 19:54:46 Your beard is look pretty scraggly too. Oil that shit up, make it look more presentable.
8356 2018-09-01 19:54:31 Oil change needs to be taken care off, laundry. To top it off I haven’t had anytime for my princess
8357 2018-09-01 19:54:30 Ladies, do you like the shape tape foundation by tarte? What’s a good foundation y’all. I currently buy from the body shop because their foundation comes with tea tree oil but I want to try something different. Tyty
8358 2018-09-01 19:54:26 Congrats Rico!!
8359 2018-09-01 19:54:20 We did not nationalize Standard Oil.
8360 2018-09-01 19:54:16 Change of name from Indian Oil company to Indian Oil Corporation
8361 2018-09-01 19:54:14 Nowadays weather of karachi is dry, apply olive oil and honey mask on your face for mosturiser. It will not allow your skin dry.
#SharjeelMemon
8362 2018-09-01 19:54:13 The only reason Alberta is hurting is because of the federal government holding it back. Without it, Alberta will be rich AF. Oil demand is only going to grow, especially now after people realized climate change is fake and carbon tax is another tax to make politicians richer.
8363 2018-09-01 19:54:08 Food bank I donate to publishes a “wish list” that includes condiments/seasonings/staples that acknowledge multicultural palates and cooking styles. So I bring peanut oil, chilis, coconut milk,  as well as peanut butter & spaghetti. Nothing sadder than canned green beans...
8364 2018-09-01 19:53:59 It means you’re a terminator leaking oil from your maintenance hatch
8365 2018-09-01 19:53:49 Yes but you HAVE to cook them with olive oil! Fie on this “healthy” cooking.
8366 2018-09-01 19:53:48 คิดถึงอะ เอ๊าม๊ะ คอนเดี่ยวต้นปีท้ายปีไปเลยคะ นุชยอมเฉ็บบบบ
8367 2018-09-01 19:53:44 oil is unfortunately not going anywhere anytime soon.

we are too dependent on it for our products, transportation and economies.

I may be a biologist & environmentalist.  but I am also a realist.

I look forward to the day we suck the last drop out of the earth and move on.

8369 2018-09-01 19:53:22 Just renegotiate NAFTA. Don’t screw us on softwood lumber, beef, or oil. Make mutually beneficial agreements.
8370 2018-09-01 19:53:11 The fact of the matter is that apart from Lagos and oil producing states  no other state in the south can sustain itself without federal allocation. So this parasitic thing is not peculiar to North alone
8371 2018-09-01 19:53:10 Hmmm, I never really thought about it. I suspect that Ashcroft and Rumsfeld were clean in THAT regard, and probably Cheney too, though I wouldn't doubt that some of Cheney's underlings were involved with Russians, especially his oil industry and Blackwater pals.

8373 2018-09-01 19:53:06 Shush...we don't discuss that. Bin Laden was responsible...and Saddam Hussein and various other brown people on whose oil we aren't dependent.

8379 2018-09-01 19:51:56 Venezuela's oil outpot is dropping, likely due to a lack of skill in its cronyist management, and the money they do make from it is used to meet loan deadlines. The government's highest priority is to stay solvent, not to improve the lives of the people.
8380 2018-09-01 19:51:55 Personally I think that mosaddegh was extraordinarily naive and idealistic - there was no middle ground for oil rich states in the Cold War - and that kinzer was way too sympathetic to him.  But Kinzer laid out the facts very nicely.

8416 2018-09-01 19:46:55 How about Re-negotiating the price paid for Canadian oil, if we are talking about ‘worst deal ever’?
8417 2018-09-01 19:46:49 People that are against this pipeline don’t care about the working people. People against pipelines rather buy foreign dictator oil and throw away Canada’s opportunity to pay for health care and infrastructure.

8433 2018-09-01 19:45:30 Thought republicans don’t believe in regulation. Oh yeah, only the industries they want to regulate, not oil, gas, wall st. Etc.
8434 2018-09-01 19:45:21 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
8435 2018-09-01 19:45:18 That cut in production btw would be offset with a couple million electric vehicles. And what you think is going to happen when 50%+ of all new cars sold per year are EV? Oil as we know it, is not going to survive the next 10 years

8438 2018-09-01 19:44:46 The genie oil connection is interesting. First I heard of it and will have to research that more.
8439 2018-09-01 19:44:31 It seems to me discussion of increasing oil production is related to the current changed climate crisis. The politics of oil is the politics of the environment.
8440 2018-09-01 19:44:24 Do they not change the oil?
8441 2018-09-01 19:44:15 I used Bulldog beard shampoo and balm in my bearded days. Good smell, not too expensive compared to other brands. They have an oil too but I never tried it. I’ve only ever seen it at a Midwest based grocery chain though.

8446 2018-09-01 19:43:53 With good reason, Albertans feel they are under major assault from two directions: The federal Liberals want attack Alberta's conservatism, through economic sabatoge, and the Americans are paying huge money, to many entities in Canada, to keep Alberta oil out of the world market!
8447 2018-09-01 19:43:40 Mueller trying to clean up all the trash now but keep the tainted evidence the trash found! Sorry, Americans will NOT buy anything that snake oil salesman is selling! He’s a disgrace to the Agency & needs to be fired, clearance yanked & investigated himself !

8449 2018-09-01 19:43:10 So what is the problem then? Leave Canada out. That way Canada can sell oil to  you at a profit. As you know per NAFTA we have to sell it under and loose money since 1994. Plus we sell you hydro. Plus 3-4 times WTO has stated Softwood is not being dumped. So go ahead
8450 2018-09-01 19:43:07 Fear mongering, demand exists, companies simply supply that demand. If there wasn't demand they're wouldn't be any incentive for fossil fuels. A more meaningful approach would be to invest time and energy in renewables that would compete with oil and gas thereby reducing demand.
8451 2018-09-01 19:43:03 My thoughts exactly. Billions in big oil subsidies, & their go to is transfer payments.

8467 2018-09-01 19:40:50 The problem with progressives is they don't understand nor do they care apparently about cumulative effects. Get rid of energy intensive manufacturing  industries in Ontario(they move across the border by the way) get rid of the biggest industry oil. Who cares what replaces them.

8474 2018-09-01 19:40:27 I like the idea of no more oil to BC for now, no more equalization payments, eliminate carbon tax altogether and go to court if necessary on this, take over Alberta portion of CPP and elect a government that will tax crude oil imports at 100% so jerks must buy Canadian

8495 2018-09-01 19:37:31 Oil for fuel and energy are the largest contributor to ghg emissions. Energy from renewable sources, and alternative fuel (fuel cells, algae, etc) can reduce fossil fuel usage, and ghgs. There are other oils, and non-fossil fuel based polymers.

Innovation comes from necessity.
8496 2018-09-01 19:37:26 I think a much better idea is for the producers of the oil in the current pipeline to insist their product ONLY be loaded onto tankers heading for Asia. No more to Local refineries or the US period. Btw I live in lower mainland so would personally be impacted. But enough already!
8497 2018-09-01 19:37:20 He isn’t worth reading. Ignore those that deny reality. Murphy is a climate change denier who spends his time advocating for us to stay on oil, the very opposite of what we should be doing.

8499 2018-09-01 19:36:37 "The fashion industry is in fact the second largest polluter in the world after the oil industry."
8500 2018-09-01 19:36:31 So were flip phones from 1995 to 2007. Then boom, bubble bursts, flip phone sales collapse. Flip phone makers go out of business. In 2014 oil was $110. In 2016 it collapsed to $20 only to be saved cause OPEC cut oil production
8501 2018-09-01 19:36:22 cerave in the tub, mizon recovery gel (highly recommend), rosehip oil.
8502 2018-09-01 19:36:16 Nothing on this planet smells better than garlic in olive oil.
8503 2018-09-01 19:36:15 please help me convince racists that muslims can't ride or drive cars with petrol products from anywhere but the middle east because ME oil is made from halal dinosaurs.
8504 2018-09-01 19:36:06 Is your name short for Linseed Oil?
8505 2018-09-01 19:35:48 First will learn turning into Honey ... then second class or semester turning into Olive Oil  
8506 2018-09-01 19:35:46 Trust-busting isn't even quasi-nationalizing.

When, to general acclaim, Teddy Roosevelt broke up Standard Oil & AT&T got broken up under Reagan, those companies wielded considerably less (and less dangerous) power than these tech monopolies do today.

8508 2018-09-01 19:35:35 We need to tell our president to Not kill the methane controls we have in place and not to allow the oil industry access to natural parks or off shore drilling
8509 2018-09-01 19:35:30 After waching Meghan McCain, President Obama, Joe Leiberman and others at the McCain funeral today, the contrast could not be more glaring or painful. All messages were clear and poignant rebukes of this mean-spirited, soulless, small man- nothing but a snake oil salesman.
8510 2018-09-01 19:35:25 I used to write fiction and poetry, now I mostly paint or dream of finishing screenplays, Sometimes it helps me to pick up brushes and stand before a large canvas and put oil colors on, and see what you feel, then write.
8511 2018-09-01 19:35:14 How much did olive oil contribute to tonight's victory? Ultimate question....
8512 2018-09-01 19:35:13 
8513 2018-09-01 19:35:08 That's true, makes for a nice shine too - yet I imagine talcum to be less of a mess than oil on the inside. Read about both as options that's why I'm looking around
8514 2018-09-01 19:35:04 Don't you need a viable oil & gas industry for that? #ParodyCabinet
8515 2018-09-01 19:35:00 If there are those who want to end oil exploration in Canada, you in the conservative movement helped their cause by playing politics with the issue. In govt, you too every step to make it seem as though anyone concern about the environment is somehow opposed oil exploration.
8516 2018-09-01 19:34:57 If you don’t like oil, don’t use it, or products derived from it, including public infrastructure. Maybe go live in a cabin in the woods. Wait, maybe you do!
8517 2018-09-01 19:34:57 American environmental groups are stopping Canadian oil because they can’t stop Trump. Our economy tanks and the US economy booms. How stupid are we.

8520 2018-09-01 19:34:32 And not just the oil and gas industry.
8521 2018-09-01 19:34:30 How about we re-negotiate the price of oil exported to the US? ‘Worst deal EVER’?
8522 2018-09-01 19:34:29 Tea tree oil
8523 2018-09-01 19:34:28 Ok, what are your positions on universal healthcare, oil from fracking, and money in politics?  
8524 2018-09-01 19:34:28 y’all... we start harvesting the cannabis on Wednesday, after that we just gotta put it up in the dry facility then transport it to our oil pressing/product bottling/package labeling facility. once that’s done we can start taking orders which means I can start getting $PAID$
8525 2018-09-01 19:34:21 Maybe. I've got some chronic pain I'm hoping it helps with as well, but I think I probably need a somewhat higher dose for that. I can get weed far cheaper than CBD oil, but I hate smoking and I don't trust homemade edibles.
8526 2018-09-01 19:34:20 vape oil. Please I must see
8527 2018-09-01 19:34:17 LOVE OIL...That’s all. 

Multiple uses.  Hot oil treatments, to seal in moisture, styling your hair, massage therapy, add in to your favorite lotions and creams, after shower skin conditioner.

ببین نوکس اونقدری که انتظار داشتم خوب نبود. نسبت به قیمتش اصلا نمی‌ارزید. تونر خیلی موثره.
و الان که من ضد آفتاب اوسرین(؟) میزنم نوشته که  oil control داره و بیشتر از هر چیزی جواب داده.

8535 2018-09-01 19:33:16 yesss happy skin is the best kind. I like to use the zero oil face wash and toner along with the matte moisturizer it helps my face cos im oily. Glad u like it tho :) they got a lot of good products to choose from
8536 2018-09-01 19:32:47 I want you to bring a bottle of olive oil, 
I will pray over it in the 11:30 Am

8539 2018-09-01 19:32:34 I’ve heard Pine Sol is good for taking oil stains off clothing. Maybe wood too?
8540 2018-09-01 19:32:21 The other day I asked this dude if I could put my finger in his ass & with excitement he took out the olive oil

Sir, if you don’t buy lube.
8541 2018-09-01 19:32:18 I just cancelled my entire life so I could lay on the couch ,bleed out and watch 48 Hours mystery

8542 2018-09-01 19:32:15 No Private of LeadersI think you and your Leaders not follow this rule for others Wine ki botle ma ap k leader Engine oil rakhty hain
8543 2018-09-01 19:32:14 A few yrs ago a Senator assured us there would never be flooding (sea level rise) because God's promise to Noah (Gen 9:11) was more credible than science. On Day 5 of Creation, God must've put residues of billions of trees/animals in the ground to give us coal and oil for later.
8544 2018-09-01 19:32:12 You can try encyclopedia Britannica for starters. I didn't say it wasn't used for feed. Feed is the by product. Primary is the oil. Oil makes up a small percentage of the bean that's why they created the feed market for the byproduct.
8545 2018-09-01 19:32:09 What planet are you from?  The people that knew him have long known he is racist and a criminal & piece of garbage. He became president because he’s a really good snake oil salesman and he fooled a lot of Americans that DIDN’T know him. Their eyes are opening now.
8546 2018-09-01 19:32:08 The office this weekend. Awesome to have Indy Racing back in Portland, and hanging with our good friends on ‘the pond, Colvin oil and Andretti Auto Sport.

8550 2018-09-01 19:31:52 Aww but also completely understandable. As an oil painter in college you have my utmost respects. I love when my fave people are art knowledgeable.
8551 2018-09-01 19:31:48 Fact is oil consumption world wide is going up, not down.
8552 2018-09-01 19:31:29 I cook hot dogs in a pan with just a couple drops of olive oil. It gives the dog a nice, crispy skin without burning it completely or splitting.
8553 2018-09-01 19:31:26 Hard pass

- Life long Liberal here. Taking a break from the oil pipeline party
8554 2018-09-01 19:31:22 it then goes on to say that "the Secretary shall establish and administer a competitive oil and gas prgoam for the leasing, development, production, and transportation of oil and gas from the Costal Plain"
8555 2018-09-01 19:31:22 Yes.  Break up monopolies.  Like standard oil?!
8556 2018-09-01 19:31:18 Wood has to have the greatest carbon footprint but electricity in BC is so high most homes supplement their heating with wood burning fireplace. But at least we don't have that dirty oil. What a farce

8558 2018-09-01 19:31:02 While this may be shocking to many, for anyone who was born/raised/grew up in Western PA, it is/has always been the norm. Small minded ignorance of people who live in an area that has struggled to survive, since the collapse of oil/steel industries that were their livelihoods.
8559 2018-09-01 19:31:00 F
8560 2018-09-01 19:30:55 Venezuela spent all their oil money instead of investing it in diversifying their economy.

Norway is a country that has nationalized oil and also invested the profits into economic diversification.
8561 2018-09-01 19:30:52 Just like that recovered from PTI's Ali Amin Gandapur. Have we forgotten the black labelled honey / hair oil being smuggled to Bani Gala during lockdown
8562 2018-09-01 19:30:27 Says the guy who has enough oil for himself.
8563 2018-09-01 19:30:26 The sheer look of disappointment when the mechanic asked me what kind of oil I put in my car and I didn’t know
8564 2018-09-01 19:30:25 Wow, Kenney heading to the anti oil hornet's nest, brave.
8565 2018-09-01 19:30:23 Oil is coming to an end regardless. We are just trying to ensure Alberta doesn't end up as a welfare state completely reliant on handouts from the rest of Canada. It's time you diversify.
8566 2018-09-01 19:30:22 Absolute idiocy.  Try doing some real research on oil sands emissions (vs other crude producers) instead of continuing to spew misinformation on the oil sands.
8567 2018-09-01 19:30:16 page 131 stat. 2235. it says that " Section 1003 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act shall not apply to the Coastal Plain, which refers to a 1.5 million acre part of the costal plain in Alaska that houses oil
8568 2018-09-01 19:30:16 Oil is going to the $80s
8569 2018-09-01 19:30:15 At Issue returning!
Can’t wait for Eastern Veiw on NAFTA held hostage by Trumps Ont Auto Tariffs & Que Dairy Tariffs. The West of Canada isn’t concerned bout these just curious why Ont & Que buy Saudi Sheik Oil, Venezuela Dictator & USA Oil while nixing  Energy East Pipeline
8570 2018-09-01 19:29:57 yep you know the will and we have  1 biggest oil refinery in all America In Pascagoula

Loving life rn.
8573 2018-09-01 19:29:34 Coffee is the second most traded commodity on Earth after oil.
8574 2018-09-01 19:29:31 How about spending it up clean up the disaster in Alberta’s environment?  Abandoned orphan oil wells, etc.
8575 2018-09-01 19:29:18 No. Only cooking oil.
8576 2018-09-01 19:29:15 I think we should also throttle Oil pipeline as well..... 
8577 2018-09-01 19:29:02 Funny. Cause you’ve been taking our raw logs,oil, water, and energy for less than what we Canadians get it for. Now who’s taking advantage of whom? Ontario sells USA power cheaper than they produce it. Then rape it’s citizens to compensate.
8578 2018-09-01 19:28:59 Alternative medicine = snake oil
8579 2018-09-01 19:28:48 You just know #Beto will work hard to shut down oil production it's the Democrats jam, kill anything that boosts pol lives & economy.
8580 2018-09-01 19:28:32 He loves an oil deepthroat right enough 
8581 2018-09-01 19:28:14 not really some fall in School or medical center and some in residence houses or hotel even in oil tanks

8585 2018-09-01 19:27:55 Delighted to hear that since oil is very expensive and becoming unaffordable !#warm weather
8586 2018-09-01 19:27:48 Those of who that are on your way to Greater Works Apostlic Ministry tomorrow Sunday 2 Sept, please bring a bottle of olive oil.
8587 2018-09-01 19:27:47 Lol! well, lemme just use my cottonseed oil instead... said no woke person ever.
8588 2018-09-01 19:27:42 I e been trying oil but I don't think I'm taking enough of it because I don't really feel like it's doing anything?
8589 2018-09-01 19:27:37 Biggest nearby source of oil that we don't control. Here we go again. 
Some DC estabmt factions may support: 1) oil supply neither China (So China Sea) nor Iran (Hormuz) can cut; 2) Hispanic protestors can be deported (illegal immigrants), even if born here.
8590 2018-09-01 19:27:31 Me:we should unilaterally pressure the Maduro regime to declare free and open elections monitored by an objective body to ensure no corruption in return for international open trade of their oil.

You: you’re just looking to own the socialists.

8591 2018-09-01 19:27:26 @MumbaiPolice oil spilled on to the road at new flyover near Goregaon telephone exchange Goregaon west... few bikers slipped.
8592 2018-09-01 19:27:19 Ah! I thought it was b/c they made more oil.
8593 2018-09-01 19:27:19 
8594 2018-09-01 19:27:15 Indeed a challenge for the climateers is how do you convince the developing countries that oil is not your ticket to nirvana, like it was for the west? How far advanced would we be without fossil fuels?
8595 2018-09-01 19:27:11 Let me understand this. So the Govt has spent billions in Turkana Oil Wells to produce one (1) bottle of Vaseline Jelly?
8596 2018-09-01 19:27:11 Shit i need a friend that knows how to change oil or know about cars so i can learn
8597 2018-09-01 19:27:01 When I was a kid the land of my town belonged to Edison or Signal Oil. Property owners had to pay those 2 companies a fee for living on "their" land. Aren't mineral rights fun?
8598 2018-09-01 19:26:42 Some imaginative stuff that they want us to prepare with coconut oil, and not use ghee.
Not every long ago these global NGOs ran a propaganda piece saying coconut oil is very harmful for us!
8599 2018-09-01 19:26:36 Lol. Turn all the oil taps off. Just for shits and giggles.  My favourite whale was is the humpback

8603 2018-09-01 19:26:11 I don’t know what “private” means, but I’m my hyper-liberal-anti-oil-and-gas-central-Denver-neighborhood, what I MEAN is there’s already PROBABLY a brick through my window.

8605 2018-09-01 19:25:54 Your answers are the same on every economic situation.

It's silly and dumb.

If you were in charge in the 1900's every gas station in America would be standard oil. Smh

8609 2018-09-01 19:25:22 only about 15% of our oil comes from Canada....where are you getting your info.  Canada exports 75% of their GDP to the USA.  They will make a trade deal. Don't worry. It will be in our favor.
8610 2018-09-01 19:25:03 He's  a snake oil salesman.  Grifting is what they do.  The tragedy is all the poor schlubs that buy into this load of .
8611 2018-09-01 19:24:51 This oil change took almost 4hrs. I napped in the dealerships waiting room like it was my house 
8612 2018-09-01 19:24:24 When I worked in restaurant in college, we added a dollop of olive oil to the water, then kept it in cold water. When serving it, just soak in hot water again.
8613 2018-09-01 19:24:19 LMAOOOOOOOOO ur mcm doesn’t even know how to put oil in his car
8614 2018-09-01 19:24:12 Someone liked your reply, so it came back into my feed. No, I ignored your comments for the last 15 days as they were boring.

And... you're going to FORCE an oil company that manipulates the gov't as you say, to buy oil they don't want at a higher price? Good luck with that.
8615 2018-09-01 19:24:11 Wow i have a pimple in the middle of my fucking forehead ... where’s the tea tree oil

8624 2018-09-01 19:22:52 He also repeatedly said we should have taken Iraqi oil. No matter where we invade with boots on the ground we’ll be taking their resources as payment.
8625 2018-09-01 19:22:47 If not true, you have sent those words out in the ether to contaminate it in the most Trump-like fashion. I can't figure out why you would put out an unsubstantiated report. Do the Russians have a dossier on you, too, or is Iranian oil a thing in this White House? #swampysmell
8626 2018-09-01 19:22:44 PS just check uour source of the olive oil... at lot has been found to be blended with seed oils! 

@VillaCappelli & any Californian one’s seem safest!
8627 2018-09-01 19:22:10 Makes sense since every time i think of texas i think of those oil fields n cowboys n shit. thats hella weird its compared to the bay area, why is that? cuz its becoming a tech giant or some shit???
8628 2018-09-01 19:22:02 It's 87 and humid and even though I need to mow the lawn my brain miraculously pulled through and remembered the car needs an oil change. Now in a lounge with a big screen TV, pop, and popcorn. Genius!
8629 2018-09-01 19:21:40 It was a productive morning, I suppose. For good stability I need to cool my 21 cm receiver board down to 20C from 40C. Oil immersion cooling works well. Now I need to set up a thermostat/peltier chiller for the oil. #astronomy

what a shameful way to explain the situation , they won't get any other bottles to keep honey and hair oil ,
8631 2018-09-01 19:21:27 It isn't like that now. It crashed along with the price of its main income source, oil. But since it's crash into poverty it has been riddled with numerous problems And the government is typical of others in the region and is riddled with corruption
8632 2018-09-01 19:21:24 noo red bull onli shehed and olive oil
8633 2018-09-01 19:21:24 Read a book about arthritis.  Encouraged fish oil.  I took cod liver oil.  Having worst day ... . Ouch!??
8634 2018-09-01 19:21:09 Decades of Abuse? Really? @JustinTrudeau , please stay the course. If threatened with #tariffs find a way to cut off supply/purchase of something that will hurt, like oil, food products, steel..... we can find other buyers.
8635 2018-09-01 19:21:08 Whoa! I knew you were awesome but what an amazing resume. And a Masters in oil painting?! I am most intrigued. Do you have any places where one can see some of your work?

8637 2018-09-01 19:20:54 Looks like CBD Oil might be my new friend for insomnia and migraines.  #SoFarSoGood
8638 2018-09-01 19:20:44 Oil and coal are dead. Even the Saudis are getting out of oil.
8639 2018-09-01 19:20:24 Oil is probably California's biggest natural resource. And they should leave it the hell in the ground. Especially as a coastal state with lots of ag.
8640 2018-09-01 19:20:20 What no oil?
8641 2018-09-01 19:20:00 When people ask what it’s like dating a farmer: 
1. Waking up at 5am to get them up for work
2. Stealing all of their fav work hoodies
3. Always smelling like oil or gas
4. The farm dates

8643 2018-09-01 19:19:33 Hey @Mishimoto 

I bought a ND Miata oil catch can kit. It is missing all 3 plastic connector pieces for the can.
8644 2018-09-01 19:19:12 I think this every time I hear that silly slogan. I think "what country are you living in?". Certainly not this one.  Despots have been saying this since forever. "There is a problem and I alone can fix it.". Trump is a two bit snake oil salesman and his product is fear.
8645 2018-09-01 19:19:07 My question as well. Tank 122 was hit and oil is gushing out.
8646 2018-09-01 19:19:00 Agreed. If you oppose the pipeline then you basically oppose anything that derives from it. Plastics, heating, oil, gas, driving, etc...  even public transportation uses gasoline.

8651 2018-09-01 19:18:23 So I was going to try and not smoke a joint and only do oil. I made it till now.

8655 2018-09-01 19:17:56 You need Oil on the waist oo
8656 2018-09-01 19:17:54 saudi Arabia has her own interests because she has to sell its oil and to boost their economy. So religion is used in this way. True Islam is not practiced any where in the world. 70 percent is practiced in some muslim countries
8657 2018-09-01 19:17:47 hehehe :) more in terms like extra virgin olive oil, no need to fuck the pigs

8659 2018-09-01 19:17:26 The days generating electricity by burning dirty coal, oil, and gas and polluting our environment, or by risking the chance of a nuclear meltdown, are over. We must work on capturing clean energy and switching to 100% renewable by 2030. Our future depends on it. #OH12
8660 2018-09-01 19:17:26 Having a “Grandma moment” when she use to give us Castor Oil and heated it up, I hated that!!!!
8661 2018-09-01 19:17:21 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.

8669 2018-09-01 19:16:12 Hey, from India here. Lice are a bigger problem here than in the US. My grandma oil our hair with neem oil, leave it overnight, and comb them out. It worked for us. The research is pretty divided on this though. Best of luck.
8670 2018-09-01 19:16:07 Do you think I don't know is bc of the oil? We all know it and we don't care, Maduro is giving it for free to Cuba and China anyways, all we want if to finally be free after 20 years and you know don't have to leave our country to have an opportunity to live

8677 2018-09-01 19:15:03 Please tell people which alternate fuel can be used to produce electricity that is cheaper than furnace oil also provide industry lng based gas which is cheaper than furnace oil
8678 2018-09-01 19:14:38 It’s an economic failure for a Canada. We are loosing > 100 Billon $$ in revue / year. In not getting to markets beyond the US that are booming with oil from other countries. Our loss.

8685 2018-09-01 19:13:57 It would be nice if we could get our resources to tidewater (i.e. oil), but nope... foreign interests (Tides) keep plying cash to get people to say no
8686 2018-09-01 19:13:52 Stay away from 51st Ave between Northern and Glendale. There is a car underneath oil tanker.  Emergency operations is on its way to close off the streets
8687 2018-09-01 19:13:42 Why can't these people keep their alcohol in actual ghee/oil and honey bottles. No one will ever think about checking a bottle of Dalda banaspati.
8688 2018-09-01 19:13:39 Our potentials doesn't lie in the oil and gas industry but the vast number of people we have as a region.. Population is the world biggest resources if you know Exactly how to use it.

8693 2018-09-01 19:13:00 She was lucky to have her father, many little girls were depraved of their fathers (& mothers) who were killed in wars No Name lied & cheered us into.  There was no reason to go into Iraq, they had nothing to do with 9/11, it was 'regime change' for oil rights.  #HeKnew
8694 2018-09-01 19:12:55 Grown up in a culture where all sorts of containers have been overly recycled (eg: danish cookies for sewing kits etc). Never ever saw a grey goose bottle being used to store olive oil. Or a decanter for honey. #WahBhai #WatercoolerAapka #AeseKaise

8699 2018-09-01 19:12:16 No I am not a Venezuelean, but what is happening there is ALSO happening in Syria, Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.

So explain WHY Venezuela skips the line & goes to #1?

It is all about the OIL, so don't think anyone of these jackals gives a sh*t about the people!

8708 2018-09-01 19:11:10 Of course they do. It’s an easy way to generate funds. United have has sponsorship deals in the past with gulf oil and so on.... it happens. It’s not new thing. It’s been going on for years. It’s just because it’s little old City. In my opinion, of course
8709 2018-09-01 19:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for dinner today will be: sad crust with moist coconut oil and egg.
8710 2018-09-01 19:11:04 You should read the current free trade agreement that gives the US the right to Canada’s oil and water ahead of its own citizens. As far as cars made In USA please check under the hood, car parts are made all over the world and shipped to the US, therefore most cars are assembled
8711 2018-09-01 19:11:02 Assets-as-#crypto, not #crypto-as-an-asset - that's what I believe in.

8714 2018-09-01 19:10:29 As long as the ability to service a mortgage is secure. When one has lost one's job in an oil downturn... We just hammered at our high-interest mortgage and were mortgage-free in our mid-30s. In retrospect, it might have been prudent to have "bought up" for the leverage.
8715 2018-09-01 19:10:23 Checked the oil in my car just now and realized it’s the first time I’ve done that for the new car. The hood was way heavier than I expected. But at least this car has oil and doesn’t burn through it in a trip to Sudbury

8779 2018-09-01 19:00:54 Money has 4 specific characteristics:
 
1) Money has intrinsic value. 
 2) Money is scarce. 
 3) Money is durable. 
 4) Money is easily divisable.

Gold & Silver have these characteristics and a 4,000 year history as money.

8786 2018-09-01 18:59:12 So we already know this in the Northwest and if you get the Racinboys Tulsa shootout or Racinboys or Lucas oil racing TV for dirt up, but nice to see the legend @gibvoice say it too.
8787 2018-09-01 18:59:06 Lard & boiling oil make 4 a strange mixture, but hmmmm....
8788 2018-09-01 18:59:03 I agree with you, but a lot of his income, comes at the detriment of other governors especially those in the South.
Drilling oil here and having their offices in Lagos thus enjoying taxes off the backs of others, the FG frustrating ports here so Lagos ports are patronised...
8789 2018-09-01 18:58:57 Omg, these people are hilarious.
Back in the days it was only honey, now its olive oil too.
8790 2018-09-01 18:58:43 Sindh minister claims bottles contained honey & olive oil not alcohol or any such things in Sharjeel Memo room,CJ may like to take serious notice of this statement by minister before media, it is open contradiction of CJ claim?
8791 2018-09-01 18:58:41 @EricBauman Hey jackass, what about Facebook, Target, Microsoft, Anheuser-Busch, McDonald’s and virtually every oil company. They’re just some of the many groups that have given money to the state Republican Party this year.  You going to boycott them as well?  You are an idiot.
8792 2018-09-01 18:58:37 we are seeing a plan happening here. The Texas oil companies have the Canadian government giving them billions of dollars. Alberta is a war with all the other provinces. The pipeline will go south to the USA. The Royalties are only 2%. Texas gets 98% and gets tax breaks.
8793 2018-09-01 18:58:31 Man these drive-thru oil changes are great! Usually have to wait like 30-40 minutes at the dealer. And that's if they're not busy.

8798 2018-09-01 18:58:04 Similar to last year I think! We loved our hamper. No oils though, we're good for cooking oil for a while yet! What about you two?
8799 2018-09-01 18:58:04 Probably my favorite new fast go-to recipes of the year: blend a bag of spinach, an avocado, hunk of Parmesan, a few cloves of garlic and some salt. Pecans/olive oil/Greek yogurt optional. Toss with long pasta and scarf down with glee.
8800 2018-09-01 18:58:02 What Canadians expect is for you to stop the empty rhetoric, face the fact that supporting big oil is an unsuccessful practice and actually start doing something useful. D'you realise how offensive your endlessly meaningless comments are?
8801 2018-09-01 18:57:36 I love robotic oil poffins~!
8802 2018-09-01 18:57:32 Yeah. Lol. This was the explanation from Memon. That the bottles had olive oil and honey.
8803 2018-09-01 18:57:25 Condemn the Oil and Gas industry on one hand coddle the auto and airplane industry in the other.  How do you square that? A simple glance at the electoral college, but that is liberalism, blame the poverty that created the criminal, not the criminal that made the choice.

8809 2018-09-01 18:56:59 I hear chemical peels work a lot but I haven’t actually tried it. Also rosehip oil helps.
8810 2018-09-01 18:56:53 Better then than not at all.  I wonder if some people even know what the little oil can means.
8811 2018-09-01 18:56:47 Better then what is the benefit of it. Look to Saudi Arabia for example they have the most holy place on earth from #Muslims  prospective and they are killing #Yemenis. And the #Zionist that are killing #Palestinians and advertising this are #judaism which isnot true when you /6
8812 2018-09-01 18:56:43 Written like a true oil salesman. And, you aren't wrong. You indicate what is happening and will continue, but at a reduced rate,and then, a hugely reduced rate. Read @GregorMacdonald tweet.
8813 2018-09-01 18:56:41 And the ones that drag the market can be used to replace the ones in demand, cant take soy oil to make tofu but can add mpc to make cheese

8817 2018-09-01 18:56:26 I should just soak all my clothes in vegetable oil the day I get them.
8818 2018-09-01 18:56:24 What creates the bigger carbon footprint,  oil and gas or coal? I would think coal.
8819 2018-09-01 18:56:20 You said it was a crisis, so deal with immediate concerns

Oh and also maybe stop interdicting their oil tankers so they can get revenue.

Ya know, because that MAY have something to do with their predicament?

8821 2018-09-01 18:56:07 Americans need heavy oil for their Gulf Coast refineries. Trump's abuse of Canada (which is supplying the heavy oil now) is making supply unpredictable. The obvious and typical US solution is to invade Venezuela. Is Canada next?
8822 2018-09-01 18:55:54 Price of oil will come up surely. It is just like a air filled balloon kept under water with force. Oil will get its value back soon.
8823 2018-09-01 18:55:52 Doesn’t matter how clean you keep the work station. Oil evaporates and condensed on your skin. And you must work at a nicer McDonald’s than me bc everyone here has multiple duties at the same time bc the boss is too cheap to hire more workers.
8824 2018-09-01 18:55:52 oil massage and facials rlly make u feel like a new person
8825 2018-09-01 18:55:35 Flew to Toronto ... on a plane that uses fuels derived from oil no doubt. How many know how litres of jet fuel are used per kilometre. AMD how many barrels of crude need to be refined to produce that? And yet they protest?
8826 2018-09-01 18:55:31 Do you know Scotland has taken more oil out of the ground than Norway?  Norway has an oil fund of over £1000 billion and can live of the interest.  All of Scotland's oil wealth has gone to London.  I hope you have good answers for your children, when they ask you about this.

8829 2018-09-01 18:55:14 Oil infused cap. The thing just dey shine anyhow.
8830 2018-09-01 18:55:08 Well, which American seed oil companies captured the FDA on this issue in the first place? Read about it in #theBigFatSurprise by #NinaTeichholz ... and be surprised...and disgusted!
8831 2018-09-01 18:55:02 I like peppermint oil mixed with a warm almond oil, or blackseed oil. Mix together and rub on the temples ... usually works for me.
8832 2018-09-01 18:55:01 Obama went golfing during the gulf oil spill twice and approved of forged documents proclaiming unfounded fallouts.   Obama was not a good president for our nation’s stability in all aspects of law enforcement. Police, boarder patrol officers, DOJ, FBI, CIA etc
8833 2018-09-01 18:54:34 Shaving Cream! 

- Apply oil to legs before shaving & follow it up with shampoo so your skin isn’t oily.

- You can make an after-shaving-scrub by beating 1/2 cup of coconut oil for ten minutes, then adding 1 cup coconut sugar, and a vanilla bean & mixing until combined.
8834 2018-09-01 18:54:34 When you do not use olive oil
8835 2018-09-01 18:54:25 For your information. Heavy oil is preferred. Longer molecules, more products.
8836 2018-09-01 18:54:22 a definite betrayal after topping up all the delicious oil and screenwash and treating it to new tyres
8837 2018-09-01 18:54:22 Lemon is the only thing you should put on them.
Some good olive oil is also acceptable if that's your thing
8838 2018-09-01 18:54:11 These people don't know much about data doller is strengthening against all emerging market currency infact fall in rs is among least and NPA's not increasing crude oil prices are not in India's control... Congressi chamche don't know much...
8839 2018-09-01 18:54:10 Facts are facts Rob.
Alberta is reducing carbon emissions, we’ve put a price on carbon, we’re investing in renewables, moving off coal...
Hard rock mining is a reality where we come from and this is a reality here.
Killing TMX doesn’t stop oil, it just takes Canada’s control away

8841 2018-09-01 18:53:59 You would lose. Quebec has a longer history in our Confederation. 

The federal government's settlement initiatives and "free land". The east supporting AB through the collapse of the wheat market. The fed $ that went into the development of AB oil and gas before it was viable.
8842 2018-09-01 18:53:55 I’d miss my dog, but she’d be well cared for in my absence.   Sorry, but ethics truly matter to me.  I will not compromise my morals or ethics for greed.   I just won’t.
8843 2018-09-01 18:53:52 Too bad about the future spill from an oil filled train.
8844 2018-09-01 18:53:52 i feel u, if you didnt try it before maybe buy some coconut oil, it helps for a lot of people actually if you put it in overnight and wash it out the next day, i didnt try it yet because im too lazy for it xd

8846 2018-09-01 18:53:42 Oil demand is projected to grow until the 2040’s, then decline slowly as electrification and other technologies begin to overtake it. There is still generations of work providing oil.
8847 2018-09-01 18:53:27 who loves you, but with pride, he will never ask to reach for him, he will wait until you actually do.  So if your mind/heart made you to settle for no God at all, fine. He created this mind and you used the right way you think you did.   If religion did not change the ppl to /5

8851 2018-09-01 18:53:13 Interestingly that's how you guys get 40% of your oil. We sell crude oil to you, you guys process it and then we buy what we need back!

If you keep your good and other countries keep theirs you guys wouldn't have oil.
8852 2018-09-01 18:53:09 yeah if it burns oil it'll burn more when its working harder

8854 2018-09-01 18:52:53 How do they feel about trains filled with oil coming down the Frazer Valley.  Perhaps you would be better to build the pipeline.
8855 2018-09-01 18:52:50 it’s photoshop CS6 and I’m not sure of the names ?? but it’s just an oil brush that comes with the program

8861 2018-09-01 18:51:55 It’s because my family that I wouldn’t admit to wrongdoing if I was innocent.   And if you knew my family that’s what they’d want, and expect.  But let’s be honest, none of those that have taken deals had any real concerns of being destitute.  They were guilty.
8862 2018-09-01 18:51:51 The unit of account is the gram of gold.
There's already 5.5B oz above ground.

8868 2018-09-01 18:50:42 That was stupid. Is it still hurting? I burned myself multiple times on popcorn butter/oil yesterday at work, because someone thought getting a tiny popcorn machine for the summer party was an awesome idea 
8869 2018-09-01 18:50:32 their big oil overlords won't allow it...
8870 2018-09-01 18:50:30 @AAACarolinas I'm not very happy getting a $19.95 conventional oil change coupon in the mail from AAA and when I go in they wanted $57.95+ to change my car's oil, claiming it has to be upgraded to a synthetic blend. Never paid that much. Even the dealership charges $38 for same.

8873 2018-09-01 18:50:26 Haha! Some people will tell you different Alison. Some folk use cola, some use diluted lemon juice, some use olive oil. I’ve found that it’s best just to appreciate them for what they are 
8874 2018-09-01 18:50:21 I imagine historians/ investigative reporters are burning the midnight oil to keep up with daily events. Never ever anything even close to this bizarre Presidency. The rapid pace of lies, financial conflicts, intellectual deficit, fire and fury tweets boggles the mind. Exhausting
8875 2018-09-01 18:50:21 But isn’t oil still flowing through the existing pipeline? That isn’t enough? Sounds like greediness to me....more, more, more.
8876 2018-09-01 18:50:19 While we're on the topic I've been playing with the idea of the Feds keeping TMP and operating it. As oil gets more scarce it could turn out to be a revenue pig further down the road. Saudis have been displaced by Venezuela reserves, so Canada is now ~3rd I believe.
8877 2018-09-01 18:50:17 Prager is complete bullshit funded by Oil to spread disinformation. It’s public record
8878 2018-09-01 18:50:10 I like Repu Party over Demo due to illegals but no intimidating other countries. Imagine oil rich countries Canada, Russia, Iran decides not to sell its oil with US dollar. US dollars will collapse.
8879 2018-09-01 18:50:06 i like this pic. is it oil???
8880 2018-09-01 18:50:05 Make sure your lamp is filled with oil.
8881 2018-09-01 18:50:04 Yes.. sat with them the other night at the high school football game. We shared nacho's and they told me the company they work for that makes pipe for oil drilling is expanding.. due to the tax breaks.. they're smarter than you.. 
8882 2018-09-01 18:49:57 Pay people more.  People will move for jobs.  The oil boom proved this.

The respondents aren't telling you they can't find workers.  They are telling you they can't find workers at their price.  Time to open up that wallet and let some of their moldy money out.
8883 2018-09-01 18:49:56 And as clearly stated, the FN groups have no intention of ever letting this or any other pipeline get built, regardless of consultation. So perhaps it’s time to use railroads to move our oil to USA ports in Washington. To hell with FN and Ottawa #Cdnpoli   AB must prevail
8884 2018-09-01 18:49:54 I worked at McDonalds when I was a teenager. Fry cook was my favorite position because I didn't have to deal with customers. I didn't have to bag the food. It was only constant hustle on lunch and dinner rushes. I didn't get coated in oil because we kept it clean.

8901 2018-09-01 18:47:33 My roommates and I are making pancakes for breakfast and one of them confused dish soap for oil....dead
8902 2018-09-01 18:47:25 So everyone knows: The oil bosses know EXACTLY what they’re doing to us economically. Both Canada and Trinidad & Tobago announced HUGE oil industry news on the SAME DAY. #JustSayin
8903 2018-09-01 18:47:14 Dear Car:

Please make it across town and back without the oil light coming on and/or stalling in the intersection.

Many thanks,

8904 2018-09-01 18:47:06 Seriously ?? I think she wants to join Sharjeel Memon in jail for Honey and olive oil treatment 
8905 2018-09-01 18:47:05 Got your 10' poles and flasks of oil ready? #ADnD
8906 2018-09-01 18:46:48 Cardoso is not in which means we should be better at the back but ngathi we are leaking oil still. 

#Mtn8
8907 2018-09-01 18:46:32 The US is gonna invade Venezuela for its oil.
8908 2018-09-01 18:46:17 Maybe realise that oil demand increases each year and that 10s of thousands of people work in the oil production in Canada. Even if we dont use oil for fuel we still need it for solar panels lubricates Roads Car parts Battery cases Computers Medical devices hospital supplies
8909 2018-09-01 18:46:10 What were they cooked in? Lard or oil?
8910 2018-09-01 18:46:04 A1-1) Coconut Oil

Coconut oil is primarily used in South Indian cuisine

8912 2018-09-01 18:45:32 Let’s invade Venezuela and take over their oil production! Who needs their masses. After all, they are browner than little Marco!

8913 2018-09-01 18:45:30 You k ow beetet then everyone the usage of oil and honey
8914 2018-09-01 18:45:18 On YouTube trying to learn how to change oil
8915 2018-09-01 18:45:17 Were JD Rockefeller still with us, given what Amazon and these people are getting away with, he would reconstitute Standard Oil and tell government..."make my day punks"
8916 2018-09-01 18:45:17 I’m about to just strictly fuck with oil cartridges
8917 2018-09-01 18:45:12 Dalda oil hai ya Tullo
8918 2018-09-01 18:45:10 Could be diesel oil! 
8919 2018-09-01 18:45:09 My day today: I was able to recover from my morning panic attack with little damage, prayed, cleaned, cooked, read ‘the four agreements’, made rose water, lathered myself in coconut oil, cleansed my crystals with sage & now I’m ready for my rose bath & my spliff Waheguru
8920 2018-09-01 18:45:05 Just like Iraq & Afghanistan are thankful? If the (R)s move in w/ military, the ONLY reason is for the oil, not the people. The (R)s will start WWIII with China to get control of oil in the region
8921 2018-09-01 18:44:54 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
8922 2018-09-01 18:44:53 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
8923 2018-09-01 18:44:50 Things I've learned from conservative Twitter: The Alberta government controls the price of oil, unless of course it's a government the conservative agrees with then it's beyond the control of the Alberta government...
8924 2018-09-01 18:44:35 We got oil just a broken boiler

8927 2018-09-01 18:44:08 Just spilled a bunch of oil in my shoe. That shows how my day is going.
8928 2018-09-01 18:44:03 @DrJillStein it’s your job to fight a Trumps EPA , and protect the environment , not advocate for better Russian relationships . You madam are a fraud ! A shameless entitled one at that . I want you demonstrating against big oil , standing for national monument sites  first !!
8929 2018-09-01 18:43:59 Jeez, you're definitely thick and have no idea how to comprehend my tweet above 

Of course oil has a value, but Salmond made it an integral part of his economic plans in the white paper, it was NOT a bonus.
8930 2018-09-01 18:43:50 And remember USA now exports approx the same amount of WTI Grade oil as the imported dilbit (~2.5 million bbls), for which we receive WTI prices. That’s $140 million per day against our trade deficit, and US$15 million per day in royalties Canada loses. Astonishing.
8931 2018-09-01 18:43:44 Doesn't it run on the oil tank though? You never have oil that's what I meant

8933 2018-09-01 18:43:29 Oman, it’s one of them Arabian oil rich countries
8934 2018-09-01 18:43:28 I can't take credit for that term. Managed to a gold price denominated in what unit of account? We return to the key point that while everything material (including gold) has an (energy equivalent) oil cost nothing has a gold cost because gold is not consumed in creating anything
8935 2018-09-01 18:43:27 Witch hazel and vitamin E oil , Vaseline sometimes
8936 2018-09-01 18:43:01 Oil base bricks shit hard to cook 
8937 2018-09-01 18:42:59 The minute I saw Michael Cohen flip, I thought that Trump would find an excuse to invade Venezuela. He has to find a major distraction from his problems, he mentioned doing this last year, Venezuela has govt unrest and lots of oil.
8938 2018-09-01 18:42:58 @mariamargaronis Perhaps the tomatoes takes 30 min because the rice is precooked. I am not sure about the potatoes. But as Maria noticed earlier where is the olive oil?
8939 2018-09-01 18:42:55 And NICKELBACK
8940 2018-09-01 18:42:52 was just forgotten about. Like most 'beneficial issues' ever mentioned. Like the 'Oil-for-Food Programme', stirring so much interest & made us forgive the war when first broke out after 9/11. It just quietly vanished after a scandal w/ a greedy large Oil Company being, oh well?!
8941 2018-09-01 18:42:50 I actually just saw a snap today on the “Beauty Hacks” Snapchat story and it said almond oil and sandalwood + lemon essential oils act as a scar treatment. Can’t confirm the validity of it myself!
8942 2018-09-01 18:42:49 oil arid.
8943 2018-09-01 18:42:49 Yeah, sure, you "know a guy", LOL. To blame socialism for a country's problems, when that country is NOT a purely socialist country, is beyond ignorant, shallow and wrong. What is Venezuela's economy based on? OIL. The oil crash has wayyyy more to do with their ills.
8944 2018-09-01 18:42:49 bought 48 oil pastels for $5 and tbh art is over i need to go back inside
8945 2018-09-01 18:42:49 used coconut oil to remove my makeup for the first time today ,,, why havent I been using this all this while
8946 2018-09-01 18:42:24 Not true.  We help keep your country running.  From lumber, oil, energy & uranium and many other products/materials.  It is obviously good for Canada as well.   But who are you kidding, buying Canadian means a quality consistent supply of materials at great prices.  
8947 2018-09-01 18:42:18 And oil and gas lose hundreds of millions.
8948 2018-09-01 18:42:16 Really? The oil is moving to the US for half the price, and hey sell there oil doe market value, and Saudi oil is being shipped into Canada then on rail......oil is not going away, start by stop using it then!! Why cant the idiots on the left comprehend this?
8949 2018-09-01 18:42:15 NO, you just forgot who George W Bush is and what he done! He started a war for Oil! Remeber 911 and how he just sat there? Now everybody´s talking about this great President!? O.k. compared to #realDonaldTrump Bush IS great but still ...
8950 2018-09-01 18:42:09 เห็นนิ่งๆไม่ใช่ว่าไม่รู้สึกอะไรนะ!!
8951 2018-09-01 18:42:04 My concern is that oil companies will now try to run more pipeline through US
8952 2018-09-01 18:41:58 "I received great service at the carson Big O tires location. I got a fast oil change and friendly service!" @Groupon #HappyCustomer
8953 2018-09-01 18:41:52 You are always on the cutting edge. Now just pour some oil on her too lol
8954 2018-09-01 18:41:50 And most of the palm oil production is for biodiesel, not cosmetics.
8955 2018-09-01 18:41:29 So the so called @MigunaMiguna  will bring oil price back to normal, we should discuss serious matter
8956 2018-09-01 18:41:24 but...while i’m here *cough cough* a black sunshine perfume oil would be lit lol.

8958 2018-09-01 18:41:22 Read the tweet by @GregorMacdonald concerning "Oil Fall" to get an idea about the future of oil.
8959 2018-09-01 18:41:18 Only go to Crappy Tire when motor oil is on sale..
8960 2018-09-01 18:41:17 Ur head get oil ah swear
8961 2018-09-01 18:41:15 Just watched a man blow dry his truck with a leafblower and then come over and ask me if I needed help while I was putting oil in my car askdlhfs no thank you, sir
8962 2018-09-01 18:41:04 in the new 70000 page tax code that recently passed, there is a line that allows for oil drilling on animal preservations in the arctic
8963 2018-09-01 18:40:48 That is one route of administration but we're finding that in an overly-acidic system, too few cannabinoids get to the liver.  By combining the oil with a slow digesting food, you improve efficacy immensely.

8968 2018-09-01 18:40:06 that consent ruling could be huge for other groups in ecuador fighting oil drilling, like block 22 in waorani territory
8969 2018-09-01 18:40:01 The last time I checked,oil was discovered in Turkana . Why should the price of fuel take a hike? @UKenyatta @HKRotich Explain to me like a kid
8970 2018-09-01 18:39:57 We don’t need your tar sand oil. We have by far the most energy resources in the world.
8971 2018-09-01 18:39:43 WHY THE FUCK DO MY OIL CHANGES COST FUCKING $90 WITH A DAMN COUPON?!?! 
8972 2018-09-01 18:39:39 It's amazing how much easier it is 2 breathe w/ the Tea tree oil & Clove oil in the oil burner. Helps being able 2 breathe properly U don't feel so intense.
8973 2018-09-01 18:39:35 Lash Growth Serum! 

- Apply a thin layer of coconut oil onto your eye lid before going to sleep.

- When you wake up, it should hopefully have absorbed into your lashes.

- You can apply this during the day, but if you have sensitive eyes like me, it may sting a little.
8974 2018-09-01 18:39:34 If the Kitten dollar starts falling, country's see's their oil buying capacity shrinking and they prop it back up. Yes, you are a crafty one. One private bank of kitten has made the whole world beholden to you. Debt is control. You seek power and you found it. All hail Kitten!!!
8975 2018-09-01 18:39:26 Different families use different methods for redding, passed from generation to generation. This family in Eskdale mix their own paste using oil and ‘Herdwick Red’ powder, which is then rubbed into the coat.
8976 2018-09-01 18:39:25 BS.  I wouldn’t.   The few things I have in my world are my word, and my integrity.   If I’m innocent, I’d go to prison saying so.

8979 2018-09-01 18:39:07 Gold is money not a currency - big difference.
Has the 4 characteristics of money including 'durability'. Not sure why you'd like money to be consumable. 

Gold's qualities includes its v. high stock-to-flows ratio prevents devaluation.

8981 2018-09-01 18:38:53 A sane gov’t would cut First Nations into the cash flow and streamline the NEB process. Alberta must get oil to tidewater. Top national priority.

8983 2018-09-01 18:38:47 Does this mean that Infosec Snake Oil owe him royalties now?
8984 2018-09-01 18:38:44 In reality the US-lead embargo of Japan's oil kinda forced their hand. Japan had to choose between overseeing the obliteration of their own economy, or risk war with the US. They couldn't have managed a war with the USSR with only 18 months worth of oil.

8986 2018-09-01 18:38:38 3. Finished the article on oil boilers. Hilariously, when I first read the brief I thought it said "old boilers" and replied to my colleague with a response along the lines of . At the exact moment that he replied "why is this funny?", I realised I'd misread it ...
8987 2018-09-01 18:38:34 If you were witness to the oil prices- both domestic retail and international crude bulk- you wouldn't have asked this question!! Anyway I am not criticising this govt but only analysing the choice I made in 2014.
8988 2018-09-01 18:38:29 When should us Canadians expect your apology? Before you answer, you may want to see what happens to your access to our oil, electricity and water if you cancel NAFTA.
8989 2018-09-01 18:38:28 2013 i got rekt with crude oil and lost around 90% of my capital and that was the worst trade in my life.I spent alot of times to recovery from that trade :)
8990 2018-09-01 18:38:21 Agreed - egg poacher. I used to work in a kitchen on Edinburgh's Princess Street as my summer job, and we had a stack of those.  Butter/oil the inside ans sit inside a shallow pan of gently simmering water.  Perfect every time.  Mhmmummm, now I want a poached egg on toast.
8991 2018-09-01 18:38:14 you ever see someone's FaceTuned their selfie within an inch of reality and you're like I....I can't in good conscience like this digital oil painting I'm so sorry
8992 2018-09-01 18:38:14 Russia ALREADY announced they are putting a PORT there...2 years ago.  

And of course, the oil!  Follow the money!
8993 2018-09-01 18:38:10 I've few tubers of yam & gallons of palm oil, can I follow you to yo papas house?
8994 2018-09-01 18:38:04 Nice! We have an old Oliver 77 diesel that we filled with old fry oil and took to tractor pulls, omg the smoke was incredible 
8995 2018-09-01 18:37:58 85% funding by EU, 15% by Croatia. First time China has access to EU funds for an infrastructure project. 

China’s infrastructure projects in the Balkans + buying gas and oil fields near Fier,  , 10 miles from IAP & TAP connector is, is worrying.

9002 2018-09-01 18:36:34 oil vaporizes work great at sporting event. quick puff, throw in pocket and slowly exhale walking around...or so I've heard
9003 2018-09-01 18:36:33 I think we will, but not for another 5-10 years. We can look to the turmoil of the 60s to see the pattern, it took into the 70s for things to settle. The crises that came later, eg oil, were unrelated. Buckle up, hold on to your hat for the bumpy ride, and hold on to hope. 
9004 2018-09-01 18:36:19 OIL! We attempted to move in via corps, that has been rejected, but come hell or high water, the USA will do whatever it takes to protect our oil interests, or desires.

9008 2018-09-01 18:36:10 It's the unfortunate truth.  As a society we tend to live like rock stars during the good times (higher oil prices) and hang on for dear life when it dips.

9013 2018-09-01 18:35:35 Hair Mask! 

- Apply coconut oil all over hair before you go to sleep.

- Put a towel over your pillow so it doesn’t get oily.

- In the morning, shampoo hair before turning the water on.

- Rinse our shampoo, apply conditioner, then repeat, so your hair doesn’t remain oily.
9014 2018-09-01 18:35:33 Vitamin e oil and make sure you’re exfoliating!
9015 2018-09-01 18:35:31 Hard to say. There's a lot of what-ifs and you can't account for every possibility. You'd also have to account for what the US did instead; did they concede on their embargo of Japan's oil which lead to war, leaving Japan to commit to their Northern strategy of war on the USSR?

9024 2018-09-01 18:34:53 I work at McDonald’s trust me you don’t want to be the fry cook. You breath in that nasty ass oil all day and you have no be on a nonstop hustle.

9027 2018-09-01 18:34:13 Just another war for oil?
9028 2018-09-01 18:34:06 I make it right on top of pork chops in the oven with olive oil and turmeric, it's good and nothing like cabbage.

9031 2018-09-01 18:33:39 problem with ANCSA: It creates a Native Elite in regions with oil money, raising tensions between millionaire Native executives and poor Natives. The potential for corruption is high with the amount of money being made and it's very hard to penetrate into the elite.

9036 2018-09-01 18:32:59 You think your Tesla has issues? I bought a Mercedes. It started leaking oil and cost me $5000 to fix. Then last month the thermostat went. Cost me another $1200 to fix. I personally can't wait till replace it with my own Tesla Model 3. I'd take a faulty screen glitch anyway

9040 2018-09-01 18:32:34 And if an oil producing country decides not to take Kitten dollars. You make up an excuse to invade. Iraq didn't take Kitten dollars. Now they do. Libya didn't take them, now they do. Syria doesn't take them, but you are negotiating with them right now. Iran and Russia doesn't.

9054 2018-09-01 18:31:10 A lot of the men in the oil business (and farming) see shiny toys as extensions of their manhood :-), so they are susceptible to their lure. I've always been of the view that events that one can't control (price of oil) are no basis for personal financial decisions.
9055 2018-09-01 18:31:00 I want you guys to remember I lost 20K my first year of trading using financial aid money for college. For a college student, that was huge. 

Keep going and don’t give up. I made back my 20K in two years trading oil. 

It takes time and discipline. Keep going

9064 2018-09-01 18:30:09 People are not as much fool as you think..!!
We know everything and everywhere what is right and what is wrong!
We know prices of oil and your case too..
9065 2018-09-01 18:30:05 Its your duty to defend them, this is what you are being paid for. But nation knows the fact now sir. Black label honey and olive oil

9074 2018-09-01 18:29:26 We really don't need such big investments. We need to open our people's minds to possibilities. We need to convince them about cottage industries.
Take a sunflower grower 4 ex, why sell only seeds?
He'd buy a press to extract cooking oil n sell in his locale thereby earning more

9077 2018-09-01 18:29:12 So I’m guessing the oil boom doing everyone good because all I’ve been seeing in Midland/Odessa are lambos and trucks on forces

9086 2018-09-01 18:28:31 I thought it's been the other way around so far! Cheap oil on favourable terms, and in return importing their chosen goods on their terms..... .

9088 2018-09-01 18:28:24 If you have never read Matt Simmons book "Twilight In The Desert" you should. Also keep in mind the book was written 10 years ago. As you say Au too valuable to be used as money, well you could say the same for oil. What happened to "Lower for longer"?
9089 2018-09-01 18:28:15 I think this one might actually be my favorite? And that I might order it for my wall? For religious reasons.
9090 2018-09-01 18:28:10 Just curious....What brand of olive do you use on the show? What is your favorite olive oil?
9091 2018-09-01 18:28:03 you mean the deep state oil that owns you, wishing you worked for the people and their concerns is obviously asking to much.

9093 2018-09-01 18:27:52 Bill, old agreements still in place n a lot of oil to USA shipped back to eastern Canada, huge discount to states, new line going international at good price, trust you're driving electric, solar panels, no plastic, progress/enviro can work. glasshouses?? DT?
9094 2018-09-01 18:27:42 I’ve been waiting for my car to finish getting its oil changed for two and a half hours. Like not to sound like a negative nelly but I feel like I’m gonna be late to work and that doesn’t even start for an hour and a half.
9095 2018-09-01 18:27:41 It's the reason why there are so many small "port countries" on the African coast and why Sudan was split from the north which had the ports pipelines and infrastructure and the south which had the oil.

9098 2018-09-01 18:27:09 I was thinking about this the other day. I wouldn't be shocked if that would push BC to try to separate with the WestCoast. California, Washington, Oregon.

And how funny it would be if that happened when the oil line still couldnt be built to the ocean! 
9099 2018-09-01 18:27:07 Extra Virgin OO is the best. And the Coconut Oil  for cooking is not good for the most part. Just a little saturated fat is recommended, nutritionally speaking.
9100 2018-09-01 18:27:05 A heartening takeaway from Sen. McCain's funeral is that you felt there is beneath the surface of the oil spill that is the current administration, a sense of decency, rule of law, and bipartisan resolve to uphold the ideas of our democracy ready to be reborn.
9101 2018-09-01 18:27:05 I got avocado oil and I’m too scared to try it lol. Olive oil is my new bff!

9103 2018-09-01 18:26:55 Please cancel NAFTA. Canadians would benifit tremendously by not selling the aluminum for your war machine. Or cheap oil that we have to buy back at twice the price or cheap electricity that we buy back. The manufacturing jobs would come flooding back to canada since
9104 2018-09-01 18:26:55 Funny but AB rail shipments of oil set an all time record in July. Furthermore the oil you produce is inferior which is why it sells at a big discount. Have a good day.
9105 2018-09-01 18:26:31 Fort Nelson is hurting so bad with Forestry leaving this town and now the oil and gas evaporating before our eyes. We need help up here in a big way.

9127 2018-09-01 18:24:24 True flat eathers claims hurt no one, but being paid to push a "climate change isnt real" agenda hurts every one. And the sad part is people believe the non sense that the oil industry pays you to say.

You're delusional.
9141 2018-09-01 18:22:42 If someone does a paper, "How tractor oil will perform in a warming world," (actual published paper) it is then counted as proof of man-made climate change. There's no finding of AGW - but it's used. Trash talk is all it is.

9144 2018-09-01 18:22:40 Coconut oil is the best oil choice.  This is bad info.

9164 2018-09-01 18:21:26 In my personal experience getting your oil changed at Jiffy Lube will directly result in your low oil pressure light coming on. 
9165 2018-09-01 18:21:24 And please understand me, resource control is not an end to itself. It will be provide a level of income that will set us up for the future. And to be clear the present income from mining for instance is basically zero (to federal & state) because federal is preoccupied with oil
9166 2018-09-01 18:21:22 And the public has every reason to believe you are a globalist who wants to Make America Bad Again. Pedal your snake oil elsewhere.

9171 2018-09-01 18:20:53 Yes. It’s about retaining power to transact massive tax cuts, blanket deregulation, dominance over capital and oil, etc.
9172 2018-09-01 18:20:50 But Harvard just said “Coconut oil is pure poison” 
9173 2018-09-01 18:20:46 Read again ,this time with your mind there
9174 2018-09-01 18:20:45 Gotta love it when some girl licks your slab of oil and then someone steals it out of your backpack, good ol fuckley party 
9175 2018-09-01 18:20:42 One thing people are forgetting is that Canada now owns the Trans Mountain Pipeline and as such receives all the income generated from the oil companies using it. It isn't a complete dud as claimed.

9177 2018-09-01 18:20:29 Ok so, we go in...get oil, then give it to Russia? So, we are now a colony of Russia basically.? Wha???
9178 2018-09-01 18:20:18 astrology isn't easy, you can't read a cute explanation of it on a website. 
Its like studying the bible, your studying planets, degrees, charts, zodiac signs, how symbolic imagery played a role in human history. EVERYTHING adds up. so don't @ me on how non-important it is.

9182 2018-09-01 18:19:57 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
9183 2018-09-01 18:19:45 I'm assuming it was @nationalpost .  Back in the heyday when oil was shooting up to >$100.  Basic premise was that we wouldn't know what to do with all of our riches
9184 2018-09-01 18:19:40 Who da hell charged you 250 for an oil change lmao
9185 2018-09-01 18:19:29 Do you understand how oil prices are set to oil? Don't think you do.

9188 2018-09-01 18:19:11 I am disappointed in Notley over this. The federal government should not even be involved in the pipeline but is for Alberta's sake. It is not their fault they lost the case. This is being petty and feeds the politics of hate that will destroy Canada. Oil is going the way of coal
9189 2018-09-01 18:19:04 A state governed by dangerous terrorists. The oil rich gulf state neighbours need to step up and support their Arab brothers - USA has done much of the heavy lifting for too long
9190 2018-09-01 18:19:02 You for get canada accounts for 45% of Usa oil , not counting the billions of gallons of water and natural gas. Worst deal canada signed, left USA with control of are oil. Countless lost Canadian businesses. Replaced with American Business to reap the benefits. Tear her up fast.

9200 2018-09-01 18:18:13 Our future prosperity depends on reducing and eliminating the influence of the oil and gas industry.
9201 2018-09-01 18:18:13 It will get built, Canada is on track with green energy, oil was the financial backbone of Canada will be for some time, disagree with routing n loading area, oil will be required for decade+ it doesn't change overnight, most 1st Nations a ok.

9206 2018-09-01 18:17:02 @JustinTrudeau now that PM has gained more popularity and we are ready to vote for him for next elections he better observe reality and what BC is asking. Better let US company KM to go back to texas. We dont agree to spend our tax money to please US oil companies.
9207 2018-09-01 18:16:58 The lie that tax cuts will pay for themselves and that "consumer protection" was really bad regulation juju has made the investment class and large investment blocs  (Big Pharma, Oil, Ag/Chem...) a shit-ton while we get stuck with bigger copays, fewer benefits, & stagnant wages.

9215 2018-09-01 18:16:27 You guys are funny it gives me hope going forward that people actually view oil like that. Funny with this worldwide glut that Brent has gone from $28 to $78.
9216 2018-09-01 18:16:19 Subtext- "The environment means nothing to me as I'll never have children and the oil companies are my largest donors. I don't care about the future."

9218 2018-09-01 18:16:07 Canadians are literally paying billions for all governments utter failure to champion meaningful climate action.

9221 2018-09-01 18:15:59 Have you seen that his daughters podcast with Joe Rogan is like #6 trending on YT, who'd have thought that snake oil was so popular
9222 2018-09-01 18:15:50 There is no safe level at which it is okay to use it on pets or children.

Every snake oil pusher ever: "Chemicals are bad!" *recommends a chemical 100x more toxic that is 10x the price*
9223 2018-09-01 18:15:44 Yeah it would be a shame if a cruise missile just out of the blue dropped some white phosphorus over those pretty little things wouldn’t it?
9224 2018-09-01 18:15:30 Oga, why is it ONLY 13% derivative going to oil minerals producing areas? Why not 60% or thereabouts? Why can't OGSG, PLSG, or any other solid minerals producing state earn same ~60% derivative? Why should FG own majority of NATURAL resources beneath the land in Akwa Ibom state?

9228 2018-09-01 18:14:47 1. A radical energy plan for transitioning to renewables and making a commitment to use our current resources to become world leaders in energy infrastructure. 

2. A rise in the royalty payments on oil and natural gas to pay for this. 

3. Deemphasizing the export of oil.

9234 2018-09-01 18:14:29 Why is this industry so important when so many others have also disappeared or evolved without your protests? I can only imagine it's because the oil companies are your biggest donors and you actually work for them. The future's here, Jason. Grow up.

9245 2018-09-01 18:13:17 Trump has made the US an unstable and unreliable trade partner. Do NOT hand him a win. Do NOT ink us into a 16 year deal that favours Trump. Protect Canadian companies, produce, oil and water. We have other partners.

9256 2018-09-01 18:12:15 Van. Let me clarify my position to you. 

I believe we need to use our oil to build the next generation of planetary energy infrastructure. 

I think we need to get off oil as soon as possible for the sake of our climate. 

To do this we need the following:
9257 2018-09-01 18:12:10 Bombs for oil?
9258 2018-09-01 18:12:10 Cole. And there are so many different ways to make it!! If you don’t like the KFC type full of mayo, try Napa cabbage with a miso ginger dressing. Or a mix of white and red with a vinegary olive oil dressing. Game. Changers.

Now other country's must borrow kitten dollars from you to buy oil. Now they are in the same trap as America.

9292 2018-09-01 18:08:56 Generally there’s pretty extensive PR in advance of our unwarranted military actions. Bush didn’t market Iraq as war for oil. Trump regime could undoubtedly find phony excuse for invasion, but seems it would be an obvious wag the dog ploy if attempted pre-midterms.
9293 2018-09-01 18:08:48 Every damn time i come to get a oil change it’s alllll this other shit

9295 2018-09-01 18:08:20 Look for the money or oil.  That’s the only thing that motivates them.
9296 2018-09-01 18:08:04 What about El Salvador, Honduras? Oh, that's right, they don't have any oil.

9310 2018-09-01 18:06:13 Abbe ye pehle jan le ki Dubai country nehi wo ek city hai UAE ka. Aur UAE 3rd largest oil producer. Qatar chota desh fir bhi oil production ke upar dependent hai. Aur ha pakistan ko America ne barnad kiya?Are you kidding? Bohot sare african muslim country usko kisne barbad kiya?
9311 2018-09-01 18:06:08 But...they have oil...
9312 2018-09-01 18:05:44 But it's okay to buy unethical dirty oil from countries that will kill a woman who refuses to wear a head scarf. BTW what have you given up to help the cause?  Not your tweeting device I see thats made with the help of oil, not surprised, virtue signaling is way easier.

9314 2018-09-01 18:05:29 I check my oil and coolant don’t know how to check tire pressure lol
9315 2018-09-01 18:05:23 Just because deficits are higher than inflation now (if you believe in current CPI calculation) doesn't mean it will always be like that. Just like oil "lower for longer" in the $30s and rates "lower for longer" sub 2% on the 10 year - things change.
9316 2018-09-01 18:05:15 GO BIG RED!

9318 2018-09-01 18:04:58 Love was the first blind. Now he has got his treatment. Now he looks at the look and bank balance too. If these two are not with you then go to hell. Love grease oil
9319 2018-09-01 18:04:55 I agree!
9320 2018-09-01 18:04:39 I want bread + olive oil + wine. I ain’t got no baguette though .

9323 2018-09-01 18:03:56 by disregarding astrology has a whole, your essentially disregarding a vital part of human history. This has been a part of the human evolution, regarding symbolic imagery & geography, etc, etc.
9324 2018-09-01 18:03:54 Just tasted real olive oil... mmm... not sure what is added to the  bottles they sell in SA
9325 2018-09-01 18:03:50 fui a cargar gas oil a las 1 de la mañana, en el cartel de YPF decia 36,45, me cobraron 36,99 ya aumento señora me dijeron, los expendedores ya tienen el nuevo precio. HDP
9326 2018-09-01 18:03:48 Uh, section 35? 

Anyway this one is done. What does Alberta do next? Diversify it economy perhaps?

Ha. No. The big oil overlords would NEVER allow that...
9327 2018-09-01 18:03:38 Shattered my oil dispenser this morning while making breakfast. S h a t t e r e d completely filled with oil.
9328 2018-09-01 18:03:34 Most insurance companies are controlled by short sellers and oil companies. @elonmusk should start his own insurance company. Possible names: “Better with Fire” or “Burn of the Century”
9329 2018-09-01 18:03:26 I must look like I know what I’m doing  (and I do). Two people asked me what to do with two ingredients: salmon & red potatoes. Luckily the answer is simple for both: generous garlic, olive oil & a green herb...all set!
9330 2018-09-01 18:03:23 the snake oil salesman SAID all people I don't like should be deported but actually meant AmeZon should unplug the Internet!
9331 2018-09-01 18:03:17 Grab a bottle of Johnson’s and oil up those huge titties 
9332 2018-09-01 18:03:12 Getting ready for the big trip tomorrow with @Samus2008 @nsarmoredfrog and @PaladinAlik 
Got a playlist of tunes for the road, packed up my clothes, changing the oil in my car, and later packing up all the tech I’m bringing including @dropmixgame because it’s such a great game
9333 2018-09-01 18:03:10 My cousin is in a heavily gerrymandered area and noticed how many new residents have come to town in the past year that have no intention of staying from all appearances as most are not even seeking work except for a few around the oil and gas fields.
9334 2018-09-01 18:03:02 You really can’t, oil is impossible to get out of things too, but it doesn’t smell like bong water, I might invest in a Sherlock pipe like I smoked with you, that thing was to this day the best hand pipe I’ve ever used
9335 2018-09-01 18:03:00 Brave decision by CJP to send olive oil drinker back to jail #SharjeelMemon #Pakistan  @GreyGoose
9336 2018-09-01 18:02:52 Canada has oil.  Don't tempt us to turn off the tap.  @realDonaldTrump #YouIdiot
9337 2018-09-01 18:02:47 So the driver claims these were not liquor bottles discovered by Chief Justice of Pakistan himself in #ShirjeelMemon hospital room - just the "honey and cooking oil" -  a preferable answer should have been "urine samples" of the convicted criminal. #Epoch
9338 2018-09-01 18:02:45 I know poor thing. Hopefully they gave him a good oil treatment.
9339 2018-09-01 18:02:43 Difficult to extinguish any fire ignited in refinery or oil & gas station. Especially if gases is the major process in this plant.

9342 2018-09-01 18:01:48 Don’t waste your money. You can do an effective home treatment that is chemical free by using olive oil and an excellent nit comb. It takes longer than the chemical shampoos etc., but it’s safe, effective, and leaves your hair glossy.
9343 2018-09-01 18:01:47 Maryland is leaking oil
9344 2018-09-01 18:01:47 aye i be using the castor oil  ima grab some cantu next time i hit the store
9345 2018-09-01 18:01:25 It’s always about the oil.

9347 2018-09-01 18:01:17 Yah! D Nigga good. Better oil dey him head
9348 2018-09-01 18:01:05 Getting my oil changed and I’m so hungry I’m about to faint.
9349 2018-09-01 18:01:03 The same happened with petrodollars in the late 70’s when excess ME oil profits which found their way to South America via US Banks. When the bill came it generated the 82 LATAM debt crisis. USD bulls should remember that they got paid cents on the dollar. Same will happen again
9350 2018-09-01 18:00:54 What a fony snake oil salesman.  If you like your insurance company you can keep it he said.  DOJ, FBI corrupt under Obama but we are all equal.  Satan is the father of lies.  He has many children.
9351 2018-09-01 18:00:47 Now that is socialism right out of Vladimir Lenin's political philosophy.  Literally, Lenin's version of Marxism was the Govt. taking over the most important national industries. At the time it was steel, oil, electricity etc.  
#GOPSocialists
9352 2018-09-01 18:00:40 Maybe we shouldn't shit on venezuela when their people are going through a serious crisis, people don't have food, inflation is ballooning to such an extent that people can't afford to live. maybe show a little concern for something other than oil profits.
9353 2018-09-01 18:00:39 @TheToroCompany Purchsed lawn mower in July last year. The "at your pace" model. $400. I used it 5 times.This year the self propel broken so Iook it 2 @HomeDepot and they said bad oil, spark plug and belt. NOTHING under warranty? WHAT? Only used 5 times and stored properly. SCAM!
9354 2018-09-01 18:00:33 Both Costco and Wal-Mart carry stock containers of avocado oil for very reasonable. I end up with so much I use it for deep frying. And, yes, mayo for sure
9355 2018-09-01 18:00:31 It makes NO sense for instance - Yobe, Taraba or Sokoto state waiting for oil receipts from ND and VAT from Lagos before they can pay their workers' salary. There's a deep error in such arrangement.

9358 2018-09-01 17:59:58 Thank you, only criminals want no regulations because then they can get away with murder! Who cleans up oil spills they create? Not those like Koch bros & others! Now they can go in & disturb our national parks. Used to be you could get in trouble for taking a rock from park!

9360 2018-09-01 17:59:48 All of them sell Snake Oil and when they got Trump they hit a gusher!
9361 2018-09-01 17:59:38 The overriding ‘fact’ is that Canada is better off with Notley leading Alberta than Kenney! Taking an ‘all or nothing’ approach usually gets you nothing! The realpolitik in Alberta is that oil is a big deal and no Party will get anywhere promising to shut it down.
9362 2018-09-01 17:59:37 And people should realize you are funded by the oil industry, so you can't objectively make any climate claims and be taken seriously.
9363 2018-09-01 17:59:22 Displace not display

And I was referring to PMB refusal to renew oil blocks to the oligarchy of the nation

Those are the cartel I was referring to 

As  for PMB wife ...it's all about juicy deals n interests which she promised other folks 

Try another excuse
9364 2018-09-01 17:59:20 Huge plant of oil refining is very hazardous exists in small area that available of many people living around.
There are many emissions from refinery due to flaring. And might poor control measure exists in such plant.
9365 2018-09-01 17:59:10 First talk something about the oil deals, mass murder, and child soldier. 

Kind information; probably centerister has shifted to röda gröna,  Vice Statsminister post and lots more. Environment ^2 , block is over.
9366 2018-09-01 17:59:03 Just started watching Okkupert (Occupied), in a few words it is about Europe doing an Iraq on Norway being short of oil etc. Great concept!
9367 2018-09-01 17:59:00 So the driver claims these were not liquor bottles discovered by Chief Justice of Pakistan himself in #Shirjeelmon hospital room - just the "honey and cooking oil" -  a preferable answer should have been "urine samples" of the convicted criminal. #ExtremelyInnocentRepublic.......

Bush sold the Iraq oil expedition.

Right now @Foxnews is littered with “life is hell in Venezuela” stories that talk about what a miserable failure socialism is

Trump will be saving “beautiful babies” from socialism
9370 2018-09-01 17:58:41 Venezuela sits on a sea of oil. The government stole the oil facilities built by private business. They pump less and less every year
9371 2018-09-01 17:58:16 And, do you think I don't know why the jails are full?  Those who are in jail trafficked weed...Cannabis is totally different.  Where I live, it's not legal to light a fire to weed, it's legal to take the oil...I would take cannabis before I'd take narcotics...
9372 2018-09-01 17:58:14 Awon *eru not elewon ,slaves not prisoners
9373 2018-09-01 17:58:11 As low carbon technologies increasingly disrupt the demand for fossil fuels, I’m betting we will see even more coordination among oil producers.
9374 2018-09-01 17:58:11 Sometimes back I saw  a kenyan president flag off oil from Turkana what happened? Now when I look inside the budget and  realize that  This same gava  was not expecting anything from the sale of oil then I knew were conned
9375 2018-09-01 17:58:01 #SharjeelMemon
Well Sharjeel Memon could not have availed all these luxuries in jail,so he complained of heart issues,was shifted to Jinnah Hospital then he was transported to Zia uddin Hospital.And now wine has become honey and olive oil.The organic treatment!
9376 2018-09-01 17:57:38 They are the agency with the most sweeping investigative powers in Canada. The call for inquiry claimed we were a proxy for 'deep pocketed' 'Big Oil' - we're not.
9377 2018-09-01 17:57:35 Well you killed our agriculture with your tariffs,now you want to stop our oil. You’re the one who forced the pipeline on everybody now you don’t want their oil.
9378 2018-09-01 17:57:15 Yeah! Those damn oil companies, cars, trucks and airliners caused the climate change that killed the Neanderthals 300,000 years ago.  Technology sucked then, too.  Even MS-DOS was a joke. Way too slow.  The only apple grew on a tree.  Siri didn't know crap.  Bad 'ol days.
9379 2018-09-01 17:57:05 People, I just wanna know how much this oil change is gonna cost me, come onnnnn. 
9380 2018-09-01 17:56:45 I can understand  “shahad in bottle “ with a pinch of salt.      If I agree with their twisted explanations but don’t understand What is the purpose of olive oil ?  is he a Nawab? 
9381 2018-09-01 17:56:43 No need for a test drive for an oil change
9382 2018-09-01 17:56:26 Origin of Shaku shaku
9383 2018-09-01 17:56:23 you've even tweeted about astrology used historically before mankind has brought up religion (this is a paraphrase ofc), astrology was discovered before astronomy. Without astrology humans wouldn't have a guide for the subconscious/ mapping out oceans/ predicting harvest times...
9384 2018-09-01 17:56:18 If you like the dressing you’ll like the salad. Try balsamic vinegar or a mixture of olive oil, lemon, vinegar, and deba roman
9385 2018-09-01 17:56:15 They have oil my guy
9386 2018-09-01 17:56:12 Why are you not using coconut oil, the hair food of the gods?
9387 2018-09-01 17:55:49 This pathetic government is exploiting its citizens. We refine oil here in South Africa but we still pay more than countries that buy petroleum products from us. Petrol is much cheaper in Swaziland and Botswana.
9388 2018-09-01 17:55:35 So was Venezuela before the government started to appropriate and "redistribute" the private property of the businesses and industries operating in their country, which is why they left leaving oil the only source of income, hence the problem they have today.

9391 2018-09-01 17:55:00 @GirlTalkZA #GirlTalkZa Hi guys, what do you recommend for bald spots? I've used Minoxidil, peppermint oil and eucalyptus oil. None of these work for me. Instead my scalp becomes dry (looks burnt). I've also tried coconut oil and HR placenta. Please help 
9392 2018-09-01 17:54:53 Right now, everyone here is worried and scared. 

Now, how that translates in Texas when oil is at $70/barrel and WTI is flourishing...maybe they’re feeling differently.
9393 2018-09-01 17:54:47 The movers appear to have thrown an open bottle of olive oil into a box of box containing my dishes. Very greasy indeed.

Also, I have 4 total bottles of olive oil for some reason.

#italianproblems
9394 2018-09-01 17:54:45 Muslims r incapable of doing anything on their own. Without western technology there would b no oil discovered & drilled. Every gadget u use - cellphone, computer, washing m/c, fridge, car - is due to western technology. U don't have a foot to stand on to blame d west for ur woes
9395 2018-09-01 17:54:45 Venezuela is failed socialism, corruption, predatory loans, low oil prices, more corruption, poor leadership
9396 2018-09-01 17:54:40 Right, so you just oil a rag and wipe them over the ratchets?
9397 2018-09-01 17:54:35 Maybe if your Hero had saved some of the money he realised from crude oil and others, we wont even go into recession in 2015, even his own minister of finnance shouted that she warned him but he was more concern about looting and allowing Dasuki and the likes milked us dry
9398 2018-09-01 17:54:27 All funded by dirty oil money from a repressive regime. 

9399 2018-09-01 17:54:13 So glad he took my Jeep to get a oil change and car wash 
9400 2018-09-01 17:54:03 Had big plans to get things done today... instead sitting around waiting to get husband's oil changed in his truck.
9401 2018-09-01 17:54:01 @dpradhanbjp,can a Indian know what is the processing price of patroliam products which was added in crude oil
9402 2018-09-01 17:54:01 It’s not internal if it threatens the whole region’s stability. The deep state central bankers have assets in all these countries, including Russia and the USA. They simply want to control oil markets and the creation of currency.
9403 2018-09-01 17:54:00 Just wanted to thank @Ford engineers for putting the Oil Pressure Sender in the hardest possible location on the F150 with the 5.0 V-8. I appreciate your thoughts and generosity when designing the motor. Love my #Ford but damn im angry right now!
9404 2018-09-01 17:53:59 Venezuela has heavy oil and extra-heavy oil. As much heavy oil as Saudi Arabia has light oil. Heavy oil requires more processing to turn into gasoline; therefore costs more. Google the Orinoco Belt.
9405 2018-09-01 17:53:48 @charlesadler @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @RachelNotley   Just a reminder of how the Saudis use their Oil profits.  The world needs Canada’s ethical energy!
9406 2018-09-01 17:53:42 That oil spot from the hair sheen on the headrest... I connect with that on so many levels
9407 2018-09-01 17:53:41 Do tasbihi
9408 2018-09-01 17:53:37 Olive oil really comes in handy with fresh made noodles. Keeps them from sticking together. Could be a traditional habit?
9409 2018-09-01 17:53:31 Only hurting the citizens of Canada! A great Oil and Gas bussiness is world wide independence!! Don’t pay more for gas when you are sitting on long term reserves for your country. Pipelines are better for the environment anyway than transporting oil by train!
9410 2018-09-01 17:53:09 this is v/ true, to anyone who takes astrology and natal charts seriously, i don't think i've heard from any of them discuss the subject failing them in terms of studying people's personality, etc.
9411 2018-09-01 17:53:06 No experience w chainsaws, and I’ve not had good luck with small gas engines, but big box home stores sell premixed oil/gas that isn’t that expensive considering the hassle of mixing. We use that for a gas string trimmer when I got tired of battery issues last summer.
9412 2018-09-01 17:53:05 Yes, but there is also the people of Venezuela, most of them are desperately trying to throw the government out by all legal means and the government keeps cheating to stay in power. Venezuela is a very complex issue and there is more than oil at stake.
9413 2018-09-01 17:52:53 Hopefully this is a wakeup call for Canada. Time to stop riding on US coatails. We have resources, tech, water,
Oil, lumber!
9414 2018-09-01 17:52:43 Sitting in the vets a man comes in covered with tattoos,
I say to Eddie would you like one with 'Heid' on ?
No he said...but I would have one with Horse Hill ...
9415 2018-09-01 17:52:38 Love was the first blind. Now he has got his treatment. Now he looks at the look and bank balance too. If these two are not with you then go to hell. Love grease oil
9416 2018-09-01 17:52:31 Just not oil..
9417 2018-09-01 17:52:30 note to self:
put less oil in the pan if you're doing one of those "chicken strips in curry sauce with rice" things you can buy from the supermarket again
9418 2018-09-01 17:52:30 Obviously by his torrent of tweets this morning trump is angry . He knows he is despised by the smart and successful people in the world he is an outcast. A snake oil salesmen
9419 2018-09-01 17:52:24 Do you have greek yoghurt, olive oil, salt, pepper and lemon/lime at home?  You can prepare a quick and tasty dressing with them
9420 2018-09-01 17:52:24 Salt that water for sure, dab of olive oil in the water as well(idk why I just always have)
9421 2018-09-01 17:52:23 The reason I started smoking was because of all the pain I would go through I’ve smoked dabs but never tried this oil makes me want to though lol
9422 2018-09-01 17:52:21 might wanna mention the history of colonialism, especially given your disgusting pandering to Big Oil recently, but hey what do I know.
9423 2018-09-01 17:52:12 The sea was proud that it could immerse the whole world,
One drop of oil came in and swim !!
9424 2018-09-01 17:52:10 Love was the first blind. Now he has got his treatment. Now he looks at the look and bank balance too. If these two are not with you then go to hell. Love grease oil
9425 2018-09-01 17:52:06 tea tree & witch hazel wipes, tea tree water spray, tea tree oil.. BE GONE SPOTS
9426 2018-09-01 17:51:52 the 9/11 planes were holograms! Satellites watch you go to the bathroom in public and private! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
9427 2018-09-01 17:51:51 The cake is a box of white cake mix, eggs, veggie oil, tequila, and strawberry margarita mix. The frosting is margarita mix, cream cheese, butter, and powdered sugar.
They're real good, if I do say so myself.
9428 2018-09-01 17:51:03 The Norwegian government literally own the ONLY company that drills for oil in that country, also talking about centralization, the entire goal of socialism is to centralize all economy and industry, thats why nobody wants to set up business in such countries and why it fails.

9430 2018-09-01 17:50:52 Except it’s not oil in those 330 extra tankers a year going through Juan da fuca. It’s a gooey mix of tosic chemicals and tarry crude, which can’t be cleaned up
9431 2018-09-01 17:50:36 It’s pretty simple tbh! Grill or fry halloumi. Half and grill bell pepper. Cut wedges. Add a tiny bit of oil along with whatever herbs and spices you want, bake wedges. Put everything apart from wedges in a bun!

9434 2018-09-01 17:50:17 I want to eat fried chips but I'm feeling lazy to get up, go to the kitchen, wash the potatoes, grab a knife, peel the potatoes, slice them, wait for the oil to heat up and then fry them.

9438 2018-09-01 17:50:05 I honestly believe THEY believe this is going to be Grenada: a operational walk in the park, but with the added bonus of oil reserves as “compensation”
9439 2018-09-01 17:49:56 Ask yourself this.  When in human history have we burned so much oil, coal, natural gas and when have we destroyed the forests at this rate?  Nature is cyclical but we humans are rapidly accelerating green house gases and causing warmer temperatures at a rate never seen.
9440 2018-09-01 17:49:53 rupee not a worry in respect of fuel govt is looking the alternatives soon will come up with a plan most probably Venezuela will be the next supplier for India lets see as oil prices are internationally driven so difficult to predict !!

9443 2018-09-01 17:49:36 ... Squash ribbons work pretty well. Ribbons, not zoodles; you want some teeth and substance. 

My beloved pasta dish is with browned butter & mizythra cheese; which works nicely with squash ribbons sautéed in 50/50 of butter & good olive oil.

9456 2018-09-01 17:48:23 Get vitamin E gel caps and then poke a hole in them with a needle and rub that oil on your scars. That’s what my mom did on my back scar when I was a kid and it’s barely visible now.
9457 2018-09-01 17:48:20 I’m patiently waiting for it..Then my plan is to massively short oil..The longterm future is definitely EV’s

9464 2018-09-01 17:47:13 agreed. any scenario re cost wind/solar wins given GW status. its time to heavily tax gasoline, FF energy plants and oil companies and issue rebates to people buying EV's + Solar Panels. I am all for sending Exxon a bill for GW damage for $5 trillion, and sending them to BK. :-)
9465 2018-09-01 17:47:04 when you decide to sign a petition to not allow the state to have as many off shore oil rigs because  cute blonde is asking

9471 2018-09-01 17:46:24 There you go.   Great insight.   So our govt either acts as body guard to Russian Corp assets or we just decide, w Russia to hijack Venezuela oil.  

Thanks.
9472 2018-09-01 17:46:22 Who the fuck do damo think he is. “I’m not letting you drink no castor oil” boy fuck you get this baby out of me
9473 2018-09-01 17:46:21 Oil demand isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, prices are anyone’s guess. Late 2030s demand is suppose to be flattening - could be earlier/latter who knows.

Even during the oil crash Alberta had strongest economy in Canada.
9474 2018-09-01 17:46:14 A few years ago we got a letter from the school nurse that said to soak that head in olive oil. Smothers the live ones and makes everything easy to comb out. It works.
9475 2018-09-01 17:45:55 I don’t think you do. iirc CBD oil gives no symptoms of that. That would have to do with the THC?
9476 2018-09-01 17:45:49 Lotion just don’t work for me. I need oil

9487 2018-09-01 17:44:40 Went to get my car inspected, came out with an oil change, new brakes and rotors. I hate this place
9488 2018-09-01 17:44:14 Crude oil prices went from 37 dollars in 2004 to 91 dollars in 2013 during UPA. In 2014, crude oil price was 85 dollars and today it is in 70s range. Just facts, but for some facts don't matter.
9489 2018-09-01 17:44:08 - I acknowledge that Alberta oil doesn't command the highest price; that doesn't excuse the failure to set extraction fees at a level that would build up the Heritage Fund; for decades, PC govts made nice with the industry instead of safeguarding the future; why trust them again?
9490 2018-09-01 17:44:05 Something that *helps* is natural tea tree oil as a spot treatment. I use it at night to prevent photosensitivity.
9491 2018-09-01 17:43:58 Skincare
- have a consistent routine -
use oil free face wash
use a toner (cleans skin and dries acne) 
DONT use peel off masks on acne
9492 2018-09-01 17:43:55 Legit interest. It was an ad for beard oil lol
9493 2018-09-01 17:43:52 Can someone please call NSCDC(Civil Defense) HQ in Calabar and warn them of the dangers of keeping drums of Petroleum products like a mini Depot. 
The products are presumably recovered from alleged oil theives. They should be disposed immediately to prevent fire disaster.
9494 2018-09-01 17:43:37 A modern day snake oil salesman. Reverend?
9495 2018-09-01 17:43:22 Exfoliate in the shower with saint Ives then witch hazel followed by spot treating with benzoylperoxid overnight! Moisturize (oil free) in the morning if the procedure is too drying from the night before

9499 2018-09-01 17:43:02 I lied. It’s $75 Trillion. 

“Russia is number one on the list by far. Its total estimated natural resources are worth $75 trillion. The country has many different natural resources, but its main deposits include coal, oil, natural gas, gold and timber.”
9500 2018-09-01 17:43:02 i mostly just washed my face more often & avoided makeup and when i finally found out about the tea tree oil trick, it disappeared fdahsgf
9501 2018-09-01 17:42:57 I gotta say, down here in the middle class, we don’t have more money in our pockets. My 401k may have a little bump, but there wasn’t much in it to begin with. The tariffs are a tax on the stuff we buy every day. Inflation and high oil prices means we’re spending more.
9502 2018-09-01 17:42:51 Stay away from metals, sugars and cyclicals. If you really need to be there choose debt free companies. Sugar and other essential commodities must stay away! Paper, steel try to avoid. Oil/gas think thrice about price you pay. Cement buy if financials are good.
9503 2018-09-01 17:42:41 Spring Day well spent...getting some pampering at the Spa with my babe...Full body thai aroma oil massage...traditional thai massage...facials....
9504 2018-09-01 17:42:41 I cannot say this enough. @RachelNotley @joececiyyc. Do not. Not. Ever. Control the price of oil. Please get it out of your heads that @jkenney will somehow make oil prices rise again to 100.00 a barrel. He also does not control the price of oil.
9505 2018-09-01 17:42:38 Care for your cast iron pans the way you would a child:
• don’t leave them alone in standing water
• season them with a light coating of oil
• heat them over a hot stove to dry them quickly
9506 2018-09-01 17:42:33 Respectfully, don’t you think I would have tried everything possible before deciding to put him on meds. He’s been on CBD oil. This was already a hard decision and I don’t need random opinions making me feel like I don’t have Teddy’s health in mind. I got it. Thanks tho.
9507 2018-09-01 17:42:24 A #FunFact for a great Spring weekend and new month ahead! ... Olive oil, wine and a good dose of chocolate were the reasons attributed by Jeanne Calment for her long life (122 years old). @dailymaverick
9508 2018-09-01 17:42:21 During the 08 campaign Mike Barnicle, on MSNBCs Hardball went on a rant & implied McCain was a racist because a campaign ad showed a pic of Obama next to the words "More Foreign Oil" Because the ad used the word "foreign " next to Obama's face. Barnicle concluded this was racism.
9509 2018-09-01 17:42:11 I buy A2 milk. Thanks to @girishs2 I use cow butter and make my own ghee. In South we have the nabit of keeping makkan for lord Krishna not coconut oil
9510 2018-09-01 17:42:03 No because Norway is indeed not comparable, it is a capitalist social democracy which is why it still has industry and commerce to drive the economy despite oil prices, not to mention their extended use of the free market and investments to pay for their welfare.
9511 2018-09-01 17:41:50 Charlatans, snake oil salespeople, grifters.
9512 2018-09-01 17:41:41 Yes I admit oil prices are increasing, here in my country oil prices have gone up. Humans r now trying to find different sources for energy.
9513 2018-09-01 17:41:35 Why is this still going on? Yes we get it he was a politician who stood up for those with $$ to kill millions around the work for power and oil

9515 2018-09-01 17:41:19 Your “Courtesy Fluid Check” during oil change is bogus. Unless you can come up with another reason why my coolant is bone dry and you didn’t tell me. Do you just fill up my windshield fluid because you think I’m too stupid to check the others?

9517 2018-09-01 17:40:52 Honest question: does anyone out there have guidance for buying a chainsaw? New house has a 1/4 mile / 400m driveway that’s badly overgrown, so I can’t get a saw with a power cord. Do they have battery-powered models, or do I have to deal with gas/oil mixture hassles?

9527 2018-09-01 17:39:59 Yes, it really is too bad she won in 2015. Wildrose austerity would have been so much more helpful. Like how Brad Wall helped Sask... maybe that’s a bad example. But it would have worked here I’m sure. But she started to fix world oil prices last year, so maybe..
9528 2018-09-01 17:39:59 Generating same revenue it has for years.  Our oil is landlocked and most goes to the US because we can’t ship it anywhere else inc east and west Cdn.  So, we bring foreign oil in and expose our coastlines to environmental risk to benefit foreign countries.
9529 2018-09-01 17:39:54 Wouldn’t it be something if history repeats itself with another oil spike, leaving many consumers and auto companies ill prepared once again, not to mention most of the airlines.
9530 2018-09-01 17:39:48 He caused a serious automobile accident while drunk, attempted to flee, and got off with little punishment. His father was a judge. How "Kennedyesque" can you get?
9531 2018-09-01 17:39:46 Remove the GST from electricity, heating oil and natural gas.
9532 2018-09-01 17:39:36 Sounds like that teaspoon of oil we don’t need.
9533 2018-09-01 17:39:28 We’re your largest oil supplier.

Try it.
9534 2018-09-01 17:39:21 Not enough immediately stop exporting oil and gas to British Columbia, resins this tax fraud carbon tax, explore becoming a territory of the  along with Saskatchewan and we become Texas north. Billions in investment billions saved in transfer payments
9535 2018-09-01 17:39:20 We’re entirely reactive in this province. ‘What if’we never get this oil out to market the way they’re trying? Which, was a long shot at best.  What’s the plan b?  I voted NDP, but don’t see much more than Rach stamping her feet. How about some leadership in diversification?
9536 2018-09-01 17:39:15 Russia owns the majority stake in Venezuela’s largest oil company.  I have been waiting since the inauguration to see when this would become a hot button issue for this administration.

9540 2018-09-01 17:38:46 If you want oil gone then Fort Mac shouldn't be your target..our cities are. 1.5 % of emissions  vs. 40+%. Electric cars, good mass transit, get rid of air conditioners etc. Closing the oil industry is a NIMBY move by city dwellers.
9541 2018-09-01 17:38:43 Those people who protest should give up everything they have related to oil, put back on their moccasins wrap themselves in buffalo coats and beggar f into the forest. They don’t deserve what they have so move on!
9542 2018-09-01 17:38:35 Only by the good graces of OPEC cutting production oil has oil prices rebounded. The cut will be offset by a couple million EVs which are currently flying off the shelves. Just a matter of time before your house of cards come crashing down again

9554 2018-09-01 17:37:51 I've gotten grumbled at 3 times in 5 minutes by the people at my local car dealer. They sent me a coupon for a free oil change with no appt, but they aren't happy about me appearing w/o an appt, not wanting $850 package & reading paper before signing.

9560 2018-09-01 17:37:23 What happened to the muslim world with china giving.muslims there a terrible and inhuman time. They must be very afraid of china. Considering that china buys their oil.
9561 2018-09-01 17:37:19 Even more, they even sanctified his robber’s power and said that it was from God, and anointed him with oil.  For this he, at their wish, arranged an assembly of priests, ordered them to say what man’s relation to God should be, and ordered that every man should repeat it. /10/
9562 2018-09-01 17:37:15 No, when you eat your body creates energy to process the nutrients(think unrefined materials like oil->gasoline)
We measure this in heat, as calories.  The catalyst for the energy processes to start comes from oxygen exchange in yer lungs.  Pretty neat stuff.
9563 2018-09-01 17:36:56 made espresso in the moka pot with the darkest roast I had and got damn that first part of the brew looked like beautiful oil w/ rusty foam
9564 2018-09-01 17:36:39 It’s hardly down to Scargill and Robbo. The demise of the coal industry and wasting of  North Sea oil revenues to pay for tax breaks and keeping people  on the dole broke our country
9565 2018-09-01 17:36:37 I'm not suggesting that we stop using oil.  I was merely pointing out that to try to suggest there's something ethical about oil sands oil is absurd. However, I will also point out that we need to be vigilant in pursuing alternative forms of energy. There's enormous potential.
9566 2018-09-01 17:36:37 This is a new item prototype that I am trying out on Etsy right now.  It is a glass tray to hold Essential Oil bottles in an organized manner.  Click on the Shop Now link below my banner to read more about it.
9567 2018-09-01 17:36:30 Tough when you haven’t got the oil money, isn’t it Manny 
9568 2018-09-01 17:35:55 THIS is why @JustinTrudeau & especially @Bill_Morneau are having fits!  Their favourite Pipeline is "charity" for #KinderMorgan investors. I knew it wasn't just about the oil.  Oil is only secondary to the tax dodge for  AMERICAN investors.. Gawd.  #cdnpoli

9572 2018-09-01 17:35:20 This is so random, but is there anyone here that is expert in engine oil? That really expert yang kerja kat engine oil production. I wanna ask questions. Hit me up if you know. Thanks love 
9573 2018-09-01 17:35:19 I think it's actually like 70% of US usage. But oil and its usage is a very small part of climate change.

All oil is dirty....but it need not be the cause of your sorrows....when you can sit through 6 months of rain on your couch in a warm parlour watching TV and eating Doritos and frozen chicken pies because of it...
9581 2018-09-01 17:33:54 From where did he get wine bottles to fill honey and olive oil????#SharjeelMemon
9582 2018-09-01 17:33:50 I need a Himalayan salt lamp, a diffuser with lavender oil, a humidifier with Thieves oil, at least one fan, and a white noise app to sleep.
9583 2018-09-01 17:33:32 How can you make a dumb statement like that? A handful???? There are literally thousands of people, I.e., oil & gas, agriculture and small businesses that depend on the energy sector that have had their livelihoods stripped out from under them! I suggest you do some research.
9584 2018-09-01 17:33:14 Without natural gas there would be brownouts around the world and many industrial processes would be severely compromised.
Without coal the world would enter a catastrophic global blackout.
Without oil billions would die in the span of 12 months.

9589 2018-09-01 17:32:55 I do agree to an extent but there are many Americans in desperation who are more than willing to take those laborious jobs just to put food on the table or even keep their homes. Wages driven lower due to immigration. Especially on the professional level. I too work in Oil & Gas

9593 2018-09-01 17:32:29 "I don't think big oil and chemical companies should be allowed to pollute the air. There"

Yes you do. What cost are you willing to impose?
9594 2018-09-01 17:32:18 That's my take. Any good leader should know that. Results are important. Notley took the reigns at the worst time, but has done nothing to help her cause.  The US oil industry is booming again and we're stuck fighting internal ideological battles about who we are.
9595 2018-09-01 17:32:05 so now alchol bottles are called #tail_ki_bottle

9597 2018-09-01 17:31:49 It was surprisingly super easy. The recipe I used courtesy of @guardian called for 120g melted butter substitute but I used a mix of my fake butter (melted), EVOO, and vegetable oil and it worked out great
9598 2018-09-01 17:31:42 That they might have oil that we can steal — Trump and his “Take the oil from Iraq”.  Remember when we thought he was just clueless..

9601 2018-09-01 17:30:59 I know this is a lot of info, I will summarize: GOP takes 87% of Oil and Gas political donation money, they give hundreds of millions and it's going up. GOP opposes policy that curbs fossil fuels, raises emission standards, promotes green energy, etc. Fossil fuels are largest
9602 2018-09-01 17:30:40 Kenya produces oil but we're now on this oppressional 16%VAT just to fund some people's foreign trips @bonifacemwangi @NelsonHavi @HKRotich #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta

But "thermal" (high GHG) oil producers get >10x more free CO2 allowances/barrel than conventional sweet crude producers. Under Calif...3

9616 2018-09-01 17:29:34 No, we're not. The entire planet is warming. Many studies are commissioned every single year, every single one is in agreement. 96%+ of scientists are settled on this. Hell, before the 1980s everyone knew it was real, but then the oil industry started lobbying to spread confusion
9617 2018-09-01 17:29:32 the intersection btwn ur interest in oil history and my interest in modern LA urbanscape
9618 2018-09-01 17:29:31 Yeah this sounds quite absurd ..couldn't they smell it or taste it to know What was inside the bottle of Liquor..why they making fool out of everyone by saying there was honey n olive oil in the bottles.

9620 2018-09-01 17:29:19 The whole point of subsidies is to make things cheaper. My girlfriend broke her foot 18 months ago and, even after insurance, is still paying ($1000 for an x-ray? They cost $60-80 each). Also, "catastrophic" diseases like cancer are better caught when going in for an "oil change"

9627 2018-09-01 17:28:34 And where do you think those technology companies get their oil?  lol

9631 2018-09-01 17:28:09 block, or see one or two oil wells in like the parking lot of mcdonald’s lmao. in the city proper there r even some that are disguised as art projects or like you’ll see a big fancy building but it’s actually just a facade hiding more oil wells

SORRY TO BABBLE AT U LOL i found
9632 2018-09-01 17:27:47 One 25mg CBD gummy down the hatch at 1:15pm EST. Here goes nothing! Well, except 4.95 worth of corn syrup and CBD oil, I guess. 

If you have experience with using CBD products, especially for combatting anxiety, I'd love to hear about it either here or in DM. Thanks!
9633 2018-09-01 17:27:36 one thing i find inch resting abt LA is that bc the city sprung up around oil production, there are still oil wells everywhere... and most of them r in really urban areas too, like you might just be driving around the city and suddenly find an oil field that takes up a square
9634 2018-09-01 17:27:35 Venezuela has oil. 

Trump said we should have conquered Iraq and taken their oil.

He wants a war to whip up the rubes to support and worship him. The Republicans in Congress will go along with that.
9635 2018-09-01 17:27:31 Kindly buy yourself some Amerisur stock fella.

9647 2018-09-01 17:26:37 Somewhat. But approximately 99.5% of their problems are their own. Chavez and Maduro destroyed the Venezuelan economy. Heck, they even managed to sabotage their very lifeline, the oil industry, by replacing experts with cronies.

9661 2018-09-01 17:25:02 Use Mouth-wash, gargle on the side of the painful tooth for 20s. Then apply clove oil. Then eat a paracitamol for pain relief.

If not clove oil, chew clove.
9662 2018-09-01 17:24:58 Only 200 years of oil left with the speed we r consuming and it's happening, prices for products that r lesser in quantity r bound to go up. It takes million of years for fossils to turn into oil under intense pressure. The day they chose socialism they marked their fall.

9665 2018-09-01 17:24:46 Then Canada should stop exporting our oil
9666 2018-09-01 17:24:41 I don’t think that’s true. They are struggling hard to solve these problems, and doing so far more aggressively than, say oil companies, tobacco companies, or financial companies faced with similar crises of conscience.

9697 2018-09-01 17:20:51 so, no non invasive way to cure this cough, you need to open it to properly oil the guilty part?
9698 2018-09-01 17:20:50 You can’t use United as a comparison. United earn the money they bring in, from their footballing endeavours. City are just bankrolled by the richest oil producing families in the world.
9699 2018-09-01 17:20:48 Bulgarian/German hahahahahaha talk about  a mixed up slav.. sounds like a new sort of salad... I have a slav salad with that... Let's face it, the salad will have far more intellect.. and taste better with loads of Greek Olive Oil. Time for a nana I think. hmmm yummy. 
9700 2018-09-01 17:20:40 KDB is the engine oil that makes City's play slick. 

His vision, passing range, technique and unpredictability around the box were key. 

He was unmarkable. One moment you think he's surrounded, next thing Sterling is one on one with your keeper.

9732 2018-09-01 17:16:53 Have a nice day. If Trudeau, Notley + oil sector folk wanted pipeline so badly they should have put their money even fund raised. It's unfair: cognitive dissonance, to expect environmentally friendly Canadians to pay for project that's so detrimental to our physical survival. XOX

9736 2018-09-01 17:16:37 Canada really dislikes you.... hell, the whole world dislikes you. But Canada will just stop sending fresh water (seeing Canada has the largest fresh water sources in the world), lumber, oil, hydro electric power to the your country.
9737 2018-09-01 17:16:35 Yes nafta is a bad deal for Canada, USA got our resources for 1/4 of there worth, we weren’t aloud to stockpile oil and USA interferes with our unions weakening them

9741 2018-09-01 17:16:28 Oil prices are bound to drop everyone knows that we r running out of oil, that's why new sources like electric vehicles are being made. And this is not the reason for their fall everyone knows that socialism is responsible. Every country is facing problems related to oil.
9742 2018-09-01 17:16:19 It's expensive because of govt involvement and subsides. Medicare and Medicaid drive cost up as does malpractice insurance/lawsuits. One should only need insurance for catastrophic events. You don't have insurance on your car for oil changes do you? No, you have it for big events

9752 2018-09-01 17:14:49 I’m not missing the point. Burning oil products isn’t environmentally friendly. Did I say that people are environmentally friendly? That too would be a stupid statement. Even among oil sources, oil sands is among the worst for ghgs so ya, even relatively speaking this is dumb.

9754 2018-09-01 17:14:23 NAFTA has a clause regarding oil and gas. My bet is that #Trump isn't aware of that. If #NAFTA goes, it means Canada is no longer required to equal the oil and gas exports to other exports, and can drastically reduce it as desired.
9755 2018-09-01 17:14:21 And it will still be put on oil tankers....and sailed away
9756 2018-09-01 17:14:15 Houston is actually the ultimate American city imo. Sprawling, built for cars only, funded by oil and gas, completely powerless to guide its own destiny without the approval of the far right state government.

9821 2018-09-01 17:07:51 I really need to stop being roped into things so quickly I just came in to have one piece fixed on my car and suddenly I’m waiting two hours for a full service inspection with an oil change and tire rotation
9822 2018-09-01 17:07:50 We have all this lumber and oil in rural America yet we don't hire Americans to work and export the natural abundance of resources we already have. We're sitting on a mf gold mine but noo the rich get to profit instead.

What a coincidence RTS fails investigation turns MLN #NADRAChief said system was fine, now @CJPSaqibNisar found wine bottle  with wine PPP Nasir shah said was oil & honey ,SM blood test will b fine
9824 2018-09-01 17:07:42 Controversial...I can take or leave the things but olive oil is what I cook 90% of my food with
9825 2018-09-01 17:07:37 I’ve gotten my hair done, got a new debit card, deposited money, got an oil change, about to pack, see my pop, and then go watch the first game of the season with margs. Damn, productive and fun 
9826 2018-09-01 17:07:36 NAFTA negotiations give me a sliver of hope. Now Central Canada and others have a taste of how Albertans feel when our Oil & Gas & Coal Industries are attacked by buffoons.
9827 2018-09-01 17:07:35 Yet, 37 million Tons oil is transported by U.S. Ships,yearly, down our coast! 6,000 large vessels pump UNCHECKED, diesel, bunker fuel, chemicals from bilges into our waters! Where are the "ecologists?". Hypocrites!
9828 2018-09-01 17:07:34 Fabuloso should be considered an essential oil.
9829 2018-09-01 17:07:28 Wesay agar maan bhi lein toh inko olive oil rakhnay k liye aur koi bottles nahi milti kya
9830 2018-09-01 17:07:28 Need good bread or crackers and pears or semi sweet apples or red grapes a little honey almonds walnuts olive oil cracked black pepper Whew fanning LOL and a good sparking white or berry red Just saying
9831 2018-09-01 17:07:26 I used to do the thing where I looked at my hands like there was some olive oil on em or something
9832 2018-09-01 17:07:20 The greatest recurring suspense in my life: will aldi have the simplynature mediterranean olive oil today or will I have to kms
9833 2018-09-01 17:07:13 im not gonna deny that palm oil is bad
however, if we continue to add more and more restrictions on things to consider them "vegan" or that you must do in order to be vegan, it's going to make veganism appear unachievable and ultimately turn several people off from veganism
9834 2018-09-01 17:07:13 Cut off all funding to FN Bands that received cash to oppose Canada’s Oil Industry.
9835 2018-09-01 17:07:13 It's like they didn't read the northern gateway decision...

Their big oil masters told 'em to jump, and jump they did...
9836 2018-09-01 17:07:03 It’s crazy that people have to use tanning oil
9837 2018-09-01 17:07:02 Owowow- some oil splashed onto my hand q x q
9838 2018-09-01 17:06:59 Oil been quiet so far
9839 2018-09-01 17:06:58 Maybe we should cut you off from our oil and lumber
9840 2018-09-01 17:06:50  Mcdonalds? It is good but it makes me feel hella shitty after cuz they use too much damn oil in their food and that's nasty unhealthy.I'd rather eat In and Out cuz I know it's fresh.

9847 2018-09-01 17:06:19 If I am right, then US Dollar will decline vs other currencies & commodities will follow oil down
9848 2018-09-01 17:06:17 I finished a bottle of wine (surprise lol) last night so today I’m just on the couch bathing in peppermint oil 22 is the new 45 I swear

9850 2018-09-01 17:05:59 Well...  You have fun your way .....  Hubby had to work last minute and  Harley and I have moved on to the car dealership for an oil change.  The Cook girls know how to par-tay!
9851 2018-09-01 17:05:57    I swear bro.. Let me quickly go and ask for his account details
9852 2018-09-01 17:05:56 Wait never mind that was is coconut oil
9853 2018-09-01 17:05:53 Of course they did, to cover their lies and maintain the illusion. Human life means nothing, oil means everything. Evil, power, greed...
9854 2018-09-01 17:05:30 Tea tree oil! It’s light and won’t weigh down your roots 

I’ve heard rosemary oil and jojoba oil too
9855 2018-09-01 17:05:19 Describe yourself in a sentence. Well, I took an early workout class and got a protein smoothie which I’m now drinking while heating up leftover chili oil dumplings.

9860 2018-09-01 17:04:25 (sorta) hot take - refined oil kills more people (global warming) than refined uranium ever did. ohhh snaaap
9861 2018-09-01 17:04:24 おめでとう！！
9862 2018-09-01 17:04:24 Got up early enough to get the bread into the oven to bake and made some eggs, so I got to send babe off with a homemade breakfast  sandwich on fresh bread so that was a nice way to start the morning. I need coffee though and I need babe to hurry and return with more oil lol

9864 2018-09-01 17:03:55 Yes,think they were bombing an oil refinery. After they downed them the B24’s squadron suffered heavier losses after as a result.

9867 2018-09-01 17:03:41 No No and no, that would be a plant based diet. Vegans cause the least harm possible this includes not consuming palm oil the number 1 cause of deforestation and the biggest cause of orangutan deaths due to burning forests down. Not vegan, simple.

BTW: Why Olive oil & Honey preserve in liquor bottles, when Cans for oil & specific jars for honey are available..?

9882 2018-09-01 17:02:16 It’s a shame that you couldn’t find data that includes crudes from California and Venezuela. When compared to the oil sands, both have higher associated emissions related to their extraction and processing. But I suppose that data would hurt your narrative.

9892 2018-09-01 17:00:57 Some oil splashed up n hit me and it hurts like a mf bitch now ARGH im gonna become a raw vegan or ehatev so i never have to cook again
9893 2018-09-01 17:00:45 I agree.  I think houses should too.  Businesses, too.  Think of how much less dependency on oil we would have if we could cut the use in half.
9894 2018-09-01 17:00:45 Renewable energy isn't sustainable. Oil is needed for everything in the world, including renewable energy.

9900 2018-09-01 17:00:09 Olive oil works (slather it all over the roots/scalp/hair), but you need to keep applying it and letting it stay in overnight, plus the comb out with a lice comb is key
9901 2018-09-01 17:00:08 tbh, i only use coconut oil to wash my makeup off and that’s it 
9902 2018-09-01 17:00:03 Strange. I have not seen any Cruz or O'Rourke signs yet. All I've really seen, besides the monument, is miles and miles of oil refineries.

9909 2018-09-01 16:59:16 Rules for Ingesting Cannabis Oil:

1) Always take with food (fruit/dried fruit, nut/seeds)
2) Prepare your stomach pH for oil w/ lemon water or b soda/water
3) Time your dose 2 hours separate from other meds
4) Keep CBD-rich oil handy

9916 2018-09-01 16:58:17 Oil is already being moved by rail tankers . Where in the ruling does it say that rail cannot be used or increased.?  The increase in ships to our port will increase naturally as or region and country grow. So this shipping side of things I would imagine will be dealt with.
9917 2018-09-01 16:58:11 Those of us who lived and suffered during that time in the oil industry would agree.

9937 2018-09-01 16:55:30 In my conditioner there is literally more than 3 oils in it. Castor oil, coconut oil, grape seed oil, avocado oil. Whatever
9938 2018-09-01 16:55:08 F#ck that. Revenue from Alberta’s oil & gas sector have been carrying this country through equalization for decades & you want us to grovel to you? Get real. 
9939 2018-09-01 16:54:55 Only partisan folks drive the demand for oil? Strange, only the federal NDP is against the pipeline. (It’s not a partisan issue).
9940 2018-09-01 16:54:50 I believe necessity is mother of invention. No tar sands is my choice always. 
We need clean cars. Who killed electric car? Oil lobby. They won't stop pumping oil until we are all dead. We need oxygen to breath not burnt up with no clean air. Don't combust fossil fuels into atmos

9944 2018-09-01 16:54:18 Kleptocratic privatization & corporate raiders of America’s coffers fund @GOP . Their mantra: shareholder profits.
Trump opened a public historical natural monument to oil drilling- private profits on public land. Fox mocked a guy bagging groceries for a living. That sums it up.
9945 2018-09-01 16:54:17 Stein’s an overprivileged dilettante who inherited $500K, invested it in oil/Pharma stocks, and made more fleecing people for Recount funds. Opaque as cowflop.

9949 2018-09-01 16:53:58 Also remember that Norway sells their oil at the European standard - Brent crude. The highest price. 

We are discounted right now from the NA standard - WTI.
9950 2018-09-01 16:53:56 Also putting tea tree oil into their shampoo will help in keeping lice at bay. They love clean hair so the more it's ward the more likely they are to have lice.
9951 2018-09-01 16:53:43 Oil products are inherently dangerous: explosive and toxic.  Some are carcinogenic and teratogenic.  When used as fuels, they pollute end to end, from production through refining, distribution and end use.  They are literally threatening future generations.
9952 2018-09-01 16:53:41 Viruses are the worst. You just have to wait them out and keep the kiddos hydrated. Wash your hands well and take echinacea / goldenseal to boost the immune system, or use Thieves oil .  Prayers and good luck .

9955 2018-09-01 16:53:20 So if your car burns it’s an issue. If you really think a bbl of oil is worth 10 cents , you need to research the costs associated with getting it out of the ground.

9959 2018-09-01 16:52:50 I hope you've paid your appropriate environmental restitution for your father's sins by putting thousands of oil workers out of work.

Also, don't fly on planes. They use oil.
9960 2018-09-01 16:52:43 High oil prices desh jhalega per tara jisa Bhrashtachar admi Ko desh nahee jhalega.
9961 2018-09-01 16:52:37 Once I’m at the point of hiring people for my businesses Ima do what John D Rockefeller did with his Standard Oil employees, to earn their loyalty and have them put in their best effort for work.
9962 2018-09-01 16:52:33 Where is a good place to get your oil changed in Denton? For a reasonable price
9963 2018-09-01 16:52:30 Innisfree oil tint 
9964 2018-09-01 16:52:25 Hey #americanidiot! #USA has been taking advance of us with outrages #climatechange for ages. Do your homework dummy.  Here’s an idea: How about you get boiled for oil and then you can be poured out on the driveway to keep the dust down. #HappyLabourDay Fuckface. #Love #Canada
9965 2018-09-01 16:52:20 That is actually incorrect. Most soybean crops go for soybean oil. Most of the remaining fiber and protein is the used for feed. It is not primarily grown for feed, it's a byproduct.
9966 2018-09-01 16:52:18 ANSWER THIS QUATION.

if you had only one matche,and entered a dark room containing an oil lamp some some newspaper, and some kindling wood which would you light first???
9967 2018-09-01 16:52:15  sampo trus conditioner an tiap kali keramas jangan nyatok tiap hari pake hair serum/oil yahh
9968 2018-09-01 16:51:53 Lol na love go suffocate her gashi qato
9969 2018-09-01 16:51:52 Stupid sexy oil  you’re a tramp!
9970 2018-09-01 16:51:50 We are a society with reliance on oil. Period. We might as well be using our own, knowing we can do it well. Without oil we are going back to the days of Laura Ingalls, no phones, no plastic, no kayaks, no....
9971 2018-09-01 16:51:43 IPhone charger, school leaving certificate, passport photograph visa size, international passport, things fall apart... Ooh I love that Novel by Chinua achebe... Before I forget Vaseline and baby oil with vanilla scent... Trust me they are luxury.
9972 2018-09-01 16:51:39 Yeah , that's great buttercup but what are you doing about Russian war games in the Mediterranean and the warning they gave to stay away while they bomb civilians in Syria? Looks like ya boy Putin is moving in on China's trade highway and the oil in the middle East...
9973 2018-09-01 16:51:35 Many of us from Quebec fully understand our role in the history and economy of Canada. 

Often Albertans forget the periods when they were supported by the east, thinking their current oil industry entitles them to a greater say.

9975 2018-09-01 16:51:20 I prefer supporting Saudi Arabia than supplying cheap dirty oil to China, an economic, military, political and demographic threat to not only the Western World but to humanity too.
9976 2018-09-01 16:51:15 dismiss devastating effects of climate change and to push Alberta's dirty oil business on rest of Canadians + the world. Money is root of all evil. We are to be good stewards + this dirty tar sands project must be shelved. We must find other ways to move our selves+stuff around!X
9977 2018-09-01 16:51:14 Shaving ur kitty with coconut oil and using Malibu hemp lotion will have ur  smelling like da tropics ur welcome
9978 2018-09-01 16:51:09 World should be prepared for Middle eastern oil flow disruption. A great conflict of Muslims in horizon. Move towards Nuclear fuel for the time being. Muslims are going to kill each other. @narendramodi @realDonaldTrump @elonmusk @apk222
9979 2018-09-01 16:51:02 I might be allergic to Black Castor Oil
9980 2018-09-01 16:50:42 …???
9981 2018-09-01 16:50:41 So gasoline used for cars is just a marginal part of the use of oil? Do you care to use some numbers to substantiate that claim or is creating doubt as you did your final goal?
9982 2018-09-01 16:50:39 Maybe, but a cypherpunk ignoring international trade sanctions isn't really as big of news. What penalty would a non-US/EU person face for breaking sanctions? And I thought the embargo was primarily finance, arms, and oil. Tech R&D seems outside of that
9983 2018-09-01 16:50:36 やめて飛んでかないでー飛んでかないでーぼーくのちくび
9984 2018-09-01 16:50:34 With respect Mr. Blane: Dismissing "whataboutism" ignores the fact that Canada's oil industry generally supports thousands of jobs and social programs whereas the vast majority of profits of blood oil from the mideast kill, maim, and oppress.  I say again - Wake Up!
9985 2018-09-01 16:50:30 bentontine clay + turmeric + rose water + coconut milk + tea tree oil 

15min face mask. thank me later
9986 2018-09-01 16:50:30 US tankers transport 37million tons of oil, yearly, down our west coast! 6,000 large ships pump diesel, bunker fuel, chemicals, unchecked into our waters! Build that refinery!
9987 2018-09-01 16:50:26 広島で平成会パート2よ！待ってる♡
9988 2018-09-01 16:50:18 better get you some oils. my perfume is normally $80, but $3 with the oil.
9989 2018-09-01 16:50:15 There is one who is researching and telling us ... Coconut oil is v poisonous. Don't use it in it and this eat coconut oil ... Who is working for whom . .. Company name along with suggestions  pls
9990 2018-09-01 16:50:12 oil companies have enough RD budget to prove that global warming  is not happening..... and they are not or unable...
9991 2018-09-01 16:50:07 Who was it who said "The problem with the Middle East is they put all their countries on top of our oil"?
9992 2018-09-01 16:50:06 Ahh ahhn danayi mey
9993 2018-09-01 16:50:03 The oil  challenge is still fresh in our minds.. Don't make us rehearse
9994 2018-09-01 16:50:02 USA said don't buy arms from Russia then Pakistan buys Russian arms.and USA said don't buy Iran oil then oil price reaching 100 rupee
9995 2018-09-01 16:49:52 Me: Your Check Oil and Engine lights are on. When did that start?

Wife: 2016?
9996 2018-09-01 16:49:46 And in a country with huge oil reserves from which it derives most of its wealth.
9997 2018-09-01 16:49:41 My weakness is being overly self indulgent. Though I dont see it as self indulgent because i am a goddess and if i want to drink 3xtra dry champagne, take long showers and baths, take an hour to perfume and oil myself, eat large blue males weekly....the list goes on
9998 2018-09-01 16:49:41 Closing the oil fields would help too.
9999 2018-09-01 16:49:39 hope oil hajaaahhahaha
10000 2018-09-01 16:49:38 乳首がどっかへ飛んでく
10001 2018-09-01 16:49:16 Rawlins. Not Sinclair, but smells like Sinclair (oil refinery).
10002 2018-09-01 16:49:11 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
10003 2018-09-01 16:48:50 Hmare ghr olive oil AJ tk alcohol ki bottle me NHe Aya kbhi  
just saying
10004 2018-09-01 16:48:49 Genie Oil is such a misleading name.  It sounds like it should be a beauty product.
10005 2018-09-01 16:48:38 Australians: Is it just me or are 95% of the best bands in Australia from Melbourne? I know Midnight Oil isn't but it seems like just about everyone else is.
10006 2018-09-01 16:48:37 They fail to see that another successful EV would accelerate the move away from oil even more. Every new successful EV car is an ICE-killer and a Tesla-supporter, not the other way around.
10007 2018-09-01 16:48:34 If Aramco & Rosneft agreed with you they would have successfully IPO'd and continued expansion, respectively. As Yamani said, the Oil Age isn't ending for lack of oil: it's about declining EROEI, substitution & (Fifth Fuel) efficiency
10008 2018-09-01 16:48:28 Canadians are extremely complacent about the environment compared to Europeans. People have bought bigger trucks to feed oil industry while planetary equilibrium sputters to a halt. We don't have time to mess around with climate change denial! No federal government has right to
10009 2018-09-01 16:48:26 so this company we’re working with is behind 500 loads right so they call another company to help. so they come and unload oil in the damn freshwater pit lmfaooooo 72K down the drain
10010 2018-09-01 16:48:21 frank ocean and coconut oil is a whole ass mood
10011 2018-09-01 16:48:20 He wants to go to DC so his friends can start drilling for oil off the coastline.
10012 2018-09-01 16:48:18 Black Jamaican Castor oil. 
10013 2018-09-01 16:48:17 #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta what happened to our oil in Turkana!
10014 2018-09-01 16:48:09 “Oil” brings a dirty connotation. If liberals were in favour of it, they’d rename it.
