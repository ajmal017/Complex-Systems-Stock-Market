3 2018-12-24 23:59:30 Yo just start with a basic decent hummus and add olive oil and a dash of paprika to instantly level up
4 2018-12-24 23:59:27 She can use my 1994 Chevy truck to go back and forth in.  It loses a little oil but it's good enough for her.
5 2018-12-24 23:59:23 I want an oil diffuser shaped like a elephant
6 2018-12-24 23:59:21 Good! The US is only interested in Venezuela because they have more oil than Saudi

8 2018-12-24 23:59:07 Trying to decide between freshening up my hair color and sitting with coconut oil on to do some deep moisturizing  my gifts are wrapped....but I do need to do my mommas hair color and her nails.

41 2018-12-24 23:57:27 I usually use pad Thai noodles for my egg rolls but I got meifun. Guna do that with shrimp/ginger/cilantro/chili oil/cabbage/carrot/sprouts
42 2018-12-24 23:57:18 Thank you to Elon Musk to have the vision and the determination to follow through...three years of waiting and research, I picked up my (11 + 1) "1 Model 3" two weeks ago. Actually I sold my shares in oil companies.
43 2018-12-24 23:57:17 coconut oil is a scam for the face and hair
44 2018-12-24 23:57:09 So Nigeria's 2019 budget is based on a $60 per barrel crude oil price. But prices are already below that. Ok, say the global over supply works itself away in early 2019, what about the effect of Pres Trump leaning hard on Saudi Arabia? I think it is safer to play safe below $60.
45 2018-12-24 23:57:07 Leaving from Terminal C at EWR I was approached by a man wearing a shapeless full length dull orangey quilt coat that had what appeared to be an oil stain on his right front from waist to calf.  Something didn’t seem right; his coat was secured to the top of his neckline.
46 2018-12-24 23:57:04 Tell me there was no oil
47 2018-12-24 23:56:54 got like two hits left of my oil <<<

57 2018-12-24 23:54:34 I use coconut oil for everrrrrything
58 2018-12-24 23:54:23 Charles. Essential Oils, read my bio. Plants are medicine. We humans are made up of plant DNA (they don’t tell ya that!). No store bought oils. They are only required to put 5% oil to label “pure.” If we can make ourselves sick, we can heal ourselves. 
59 2018-12-24 23:54:04 @realDonaldTrump Please stop. We cannot take anymore!! Life is toxic with the wall, overdrilling oil, ruining the planet, wars with China and Iran, everyone fired or quitting. This is insane !!!
60 2018-12-24 23:53:52 Nice one. Just don't confuse the oil for basing the Turkey with the oil for your tan!
61 2018-12-24 23:53:45 I got her some aromatherapy lotion to help her sleep, cause she has insomnia. And a phone case. Then her other gift got delayed but that’s an essential oil diffuser.

All i want for Xmas is for Media, pundits and trolls to stop questioning our vetting of Beto.
He'd be a great candidate if he wasn't so bought by Oil & AIPAC.

Thanks Santa, a voter.

67 2018-12-24 23:53:05 Its STRESS Kim....CBD oil might work and just relax your s hedule and stress is to much honey
68 2018-12-24 23:52:56 There’s no difference whether we use our own oil or someone else’s ( fracking effects aside). When green energy is ready it will take over. So the choices are buy oil or produce it and take the ancillary benefits of independence. 

Don’t hurt yourself trying to figure it out.
69 2018-12-24 23:52:45 Like other day I use some coconut oil and coconut shampoo my curls were popping
70 2018-12-24 23:52:35 Do you use Rhett’s beard oil?

72 2018-12-24 23:52:07 Yes we have but we have ignored agriculture and totally focus crude oil
73 2018-12-24 23:52:02 I even drink the Shell penn state oil !
74 2018-12-24 23:51:32 Nooooooooo .... checking my oil !!!

80 2018-12-24 23:50:31 looks like they needed an oil change
81 2018-12-24 23:50:29 I will light some gas burners and tip some other stuff into hot oil, voila. By the time the fiddly stuff happens I’ll be caffeined up and ready to glaze/thicken.
82 2018-12-24 23:50:27 I liked your original blank tweet better.  Now don’t get all sassy with me while on vacation with your cyclones family.
83 2018-12-24 23:50:22 Boleh dong wkwk. Wanginya enak, kurang suka soalnya dia kurang ngebersihin bgtsih ya, teksturnya terlalu berat kl di jadiin first cleansing, kl pake ini malah muncul jerawat 1-1. Kl disuruh pilih oil atau balmnya, aku lebih suka yang cleansing balmnya ituu.
84 2018-12-24 23:50:02 Mike: Apparently they shut the turbines off if the wind speeds are too high.
Selina: Is it too late to turn them into oil derricks?  #Veep
85 2018-12-24 23:49:55 Those are also the same exact reasons for why we have seen #oil prices falling.

89 2018-12-24 23:49:12 Oil shorts R doing well. Big drop today.

Took my eye of the ball with equities however. 

Reversed to (temporary) long gold a few weeks ago as stated. 

Adding heavily to junior explorers. 

Need to put up an OMI chart. Breakout imminent (either way). I'm betting long.
90 2018-12-24 23:49:10 Who told me to get the oil though ???
91 2018-12-24 23:48:46 Low oil prices also have the amazing effect of keeping down inflation while simultaneously stimulating the global economy (everywhere that isn't an oil producer). Try doing that, Fed!
92 2018-12-24 23:48:38 I hated mine too I literally put baby oil on mine on the second day and rubbed for two hours until they all came off. My natural eyelashes were fucked afterwards
93 2018-12-24 23:48:19 Coal, steel, oil & manufacturing jobs aren’t relegated to the past, they are important industries to our economy, infrastructure & national security.
94 2018-12-24 23:48:17 Oil and water are going to be scarce eventually. Wars will be fought over them. The Venezuelan Navy may be the Russian Navy in disguise.
95 2018-12-24 23:48:10 That will be the Oil of Olay.
96 2018-12-24 23:47:56 Virgin oil idiocy?
97 2018-12-24 23:47:44 Oil has to hold $42 or it’s foreshadowing a nasty 1H 2019.

Thank you for your appearances and sharing knowledge with us small fry traders.

Merry Christmas to you and your family.
98 2018-12-24 23:47:03 Had an oil change scheduled today at 10 at Ferguson.... And those fuckers were closed. HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN?? Like who lets someone schedule an appointment on a day you’re closed...
99 2018-12-24 23:47:02 the other oil producing countries had other markets to supplement when the oil price went down. Venezuela didn't have a developed economy because they suffered under colonialism for most of their history.

102 2018-12-24 23:46:35 I can hold my breath for 12 minutes
103 2018-12-24 23:46:01 Great idea! Can we apply this to our oil usage, and buy local Canadian oil across our country instead of foreign oil?
104 2018-12-24 23:45:57 ‘British’ and ‘Muslim’ is a slam-dunk oxymoron. 
Being British, valuing freedoms and democratic endeavour; and what that historically and traditionally means, is at diametric odds with the medieval cult practices of Islam. It’s ‘oil & water’.
105 2018-12-24 23:45:39 Keep forgetting that Japanese people call Smash Bros in Japan スマブラ. When people say it, it sounds like 油 or oil in Japanese. I’m like “girl I don’t cook and yew KNOW that” before I realize what they’re saying
106 2018-12-24 23:45:26 Ah, yes, the success of the “tarsands” campaign to landlock Alberta oil.  Unfortunate that that group has so successfully influenced the writing of Bill C-69, the final leg in their strategy.

134 2018-12-24 23:40:51 the idea of it being a conflation altogether, when in fact a sizable amount of those donations came from oil & gas execs. but now you've pivoted to arguing about the amount relative to beto's overall donations, which has nothing to do with sirota

152 2018-12-24 23:39:23 Ralphie said the n-word in A Christmas Story
153 2018-12-24 23:39:16 I suffer with this for 17 years, there are some great medications for it but some do choose to stick to a diet to treat it. I myself have been on many treatments for it, my treatment now are injections called Simponi. 
I find coconut oil great for it also 
154 2018-12-24 23:39:05 I have put so much oil in my hair it’s literally dripping
155 2018-12-24 23:38:58 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot

158 2018-12-24 23:38:09 I don't get why people can't be nice, either. You might do best by taking your concern to the station itself or to Phillips 66, which owns the Conoco retail brand. ConocoPhillips only produces oil and natural gas. We don't have any retail or refining businesses. Good luck to you.
159 2018-12-24 23:38:07 dry skin? coconut oil want longer hair? coconut oil your heart is broken? rub some coconut oil on it b you gon be alright

165 2018-12-24 23:37:48 Any bio oil ? Or a specific one ?
166 2018-12-24 23:37:45 Salem is like, putting himself on fire. And he's putting more and more oil on it.
167 2018-12-24 23:37:30 Lowered unemployment, tax cuts, brought back steel, coal, manufacturing & oil jobs, got rid of burdensome Obamacare penalty, renegotiated NAFTA, whooped ISIS, protected USA trade through tariffs...plenty more I could list.
168 2018-12-24 23:37:03 Wow, @realDonaldTrump I would have thought you had run back to #MarAlago to get away from the commoners by now! Look at you burning the day-before-a-holiday 5:30 oil!
169 2018-12-24 23:37:02 Yes after ur normal routine, do the glow tonic , and only put the bio oil on the trouble spot then moisturize. This has glycolic acid in it so it’s super amazing with dark spot
170 2018-12-24 23:36:49 Can someone explain to me the relationship between oil and US dollar in stocks and forex trading. Why is it wen they z a downtrend in oil the same happens to us dollar @50Pips @ALLTHINGSFOREX
171 2018-12-24 23:36:33 The look on the guys face at autozone when he sees im buying diesel oil for my car 
172 2018-12-24 23:36:23 Sorry, Joe, but @POTUS is doing exactly what his supporters want him to do. That is not a "rogue" President. That is a President serving the will of the people. Have you considered selling snake oil?
173 2018-12-24 23:36:19 Oil is already running out in lighter
My stomach is nervously burning inside

Meltdown, iroha
174 2018-12-24 23:36:16 things that are tough: trying to talk about the importance of preserving the environment to my family when my dad works for the oil industry
175 2018-12-24 23:36:10 okrr so.. you need a red bellpepper (green too if you’d like, pineapples and green onion, first you’ll want to roast your bell peppers and pineapple in light oil, add protein of your choice, 2 day old rice, green onion and egg and mix in your sauce. Gang
176 2018-12-24 23:35:42 Anyone know a lot about cannabis oil???
177 2018-12-24 23:35:36 next nigga who cheat on me getting done like Lisa did Malcomn in This Christmas, Baby oil & a BELT.
178 2018-12-24 23:35:25 will cbd oil lessen my family-induced dissociation
179 2018-12-24 23:35:18 That's not good, you should do following;
1) Go for good sleep
2) Reduce amount of oil and particularly salt
3) Go for some walk
180 2018-12-24 23:35:11 Yes and whatever oil is essential for my truck’s crankcase.
181 2018-12-24 23:35:10 Crude is down -7%. I still don’t get this global slowing in oil has anything reasoning behind it.
182 2018-12-24 23:34:56 Cuticle oil.
183 2018-12-24 23:34:43 The optics of this is great.

What do you suppose the optics is of his acceptance of Big Oil money?
Or the optics of an AIPAC coalition?
How about the optics of voting in favor of off-shore oil drilling during a climate crisis?
Doesn't look good to my eyes but what do I know?
184 2018-12-24 23:34:34 今回は残念ながら会う事が

今度は新年会ですかね？
良いお年をお過ごし下さい。
では、お気をつけて...
185 2018-12-24 23:34:25 No Origins face frost and charcoal mask along with African black soap and vitamin E oil
186 2018-12-24 23:34:22 You sound about like my bros and uncles, keep selling, and working, get money then do it all over again lol, each to their own, I don't know much about cars or trucks, just gas, oil, tires, and simple stuff like that.
187 2018-12-24 23:34:17 2030? lololol, Once ever body has 707hp cars and monster SUV's and Awl subsidies for stupid ass electric vehicles/solar/wind/et al Big Oil will rocket over a hunnid again due to long cycle of underinvestment from low prices. Old dudes never try to figure just "Buy low. Sell High"
188 2018-12-24 23:34:12 こちらは棒がついてましたよ
189 2018-12-24 23:34:00 Lmaooo spinach broccoli Brussels sprouts canola oil 
190 2018-12-24 23:33:57 I wouldn’t touch a bike with Jetwash personally, it blows the protective oil/grease out of joints and seals. Get busy with a bucket of soapy water or don’t wash it.
191 2018-12-24 23:33:53 Autism + Christmas = water and oil. Bless him. He is trying so very very hard but anxiety and the feeling of being out of control just render him unable to cope. It breaks our hearts. 
I'm taking his lead tomorrow. Anything to take some of that anxiety away. Merry Xmas xx
192 2018-12-24 23:33:53 おはようございます
193 2018-12-24 23:33:39 that's unlikely to happen in a deflationary period with low oil and commodity prices
194 2018-12-24 23:33:04 Oil money gang 
195 2018-12-24 23:32:45 My mother's sprouts were pretty awful, but nicely steamed with butter is delicious and roasted with garlic and olive oil is even better.
196 2018-12-24 23:32:23 Does Rebecca have to shave her legs as well or is it just the washing bit? Maybe a spot of baby oil to give them sheen?
197 2018-12-24 23:32:14 Me i wanna oil him up
198 2018-12-24 23:31:59 Better get your Togs on and pull a Grog from the Esky, and get some Good oil from the Bush Telly!
199 2018-12-24 23:31:57 Mark told me not to take my car to work this morning cus he was gonna go get the oil changed and when he picks me up from work, he surprises me with new rims and tires.  he’s the best ever, I swear 
200 2018-12-24 23:31:46 I took a bath earlier with lemongrass essential oil and it was so refreshing  
201 2018-12-24 23:31:28 Putek arayy tagos sa puso ni anon yon oil HAHAAHAHHAHAHAHAAH
202 2018-12-24 23:31:16 is because Assad army with help of russian Air force and Iran militias re conquered most of the ISIS territory. US only took with their puppets the Kurds the places OIL and gas fields were located.
203 2018-12-24 23:31:12 GIVE ME (GUN) OIL IN MY LAMP, KEEP ME BURNING.
204 2018-12-24 23:30:47 Maybe try tea tree oil and/or benzoyl peroxide externally.
205 2018-12-24 23:30:46 “ كُن بسيطاً فإن البساطة بذاتها جمالاً “.
206 2018-12-24 23:30:42 With falling oil prices and a drop in the stock market the #FED should be worried about deflation, not inflation.  What a perfect #Christmas gift the federal reserve and the #TrumpCrash has given us.  What one failed to do the other succeed in doing to us, #bahumbug
207 2018-12-24 23:30:41 I am sure he drunk dirty oil not alcohol
208 2018-12-24 23:30:39 Keep in mind the refining and logistics associated with what is required for batteries to be wholesaled to large factories versus oil converted into gasoline and then distributed at a retail level. There is no comparison when you look at the big picture.

210 2018-12-24 23:30:27 He owns Exxon and Chevron too.  What a hypocrite.  He accused other people of owning "big oil" stocks when they were on CNBC opposite him, stating negative facts about Tesla's financial condition.
211 2018-12-24 23:30:01 used remainder of biryani wok to make a kale-spinach-broccoli soup with water, 'miso paste', lemon juice, sesame oil, and tamari

it's quite tasty
212 2018-12-24 23:30:00 Ever wonder how oil and gas power your Christmas? Here are 7 ways that it does:
213 2018-12-24 23:29:49 Notley has done nothing in 4 years but damage to the Oil and Gas industry so outside of being bias it’s next man up!
214 2018-12-24 23:29:22 Well then maybe we won't go fighting wars because of obligations made by the Nixon administration.I know we need the U.S. dollar to be worth more and paying gold for oil wasn't working but we payed are debts in blood to Arabs enough don't you think ?
215 2018-12-24 23:29:14 Forgot to mention that you need to use cooking oil to prevent the already cooked dumplings from burning. 
Using a little bit of water works too as a last resort. I think the steam from the pan works to restore the cooked dumplings. Mom recooks on low heat with cooking oil though
216 2018-12-24 23:28:56 That reminds me to ask again, Andy, what about Dandelion as a solution for those oil burners? Have you looked into it? I assume people in your village will have already done the basic insulation, double-glazed windows etc.
217 2018-12-24 23:28:49 Hopefully dey put Eko, egg and palm oil on the jollof rice. Blissful bliss
218 2018-12-24 23:28:41 In the last 24 hrs there were a total of 8 oil product tankers in the ports of Quebec City and Montreal. Yet according to Quebec Premier François Legault, there is no social acceptability for oil in Quebec.

221 2018-12-24 23:27:40 Oil? Makes? You ? Forget? Chopping? Off? To ? Pieces? People?
222 2018-12-24 23:27:19 I wish ours were that caring here. I meant to say NOT fatal for my allergies. But my sister on the other hand has fatal ones to ALL fish and seafood. She can't even have her food cooked in the same oil as it was done in.
223 2018-12-24 23:27:17 W ogóle tata wysłał mi w końcu kosmetyki do włosów i jeeeeesu szampon i maska z shea moisture jamaican black castrol oil, odżywka aloesowa z herby i olej z słodkich migdałów robi taką robotę
224 2018-12-24 23:26:02 i stopped buying things with palm oil in it but we’re all still gonna die
225 2018-12-24 23:25:31 Silk Elements olive oil shampoo/conditioner and Cantu's styling products are a godsend 
226 2018-12-24 23:25:28 You too don’t see the full picture: record low unemployment, esp.minorities; more job openings than workers; highest GDP in yrs;no new NoKo bomb threats; NATO membrs paying their share; tax cuts & rising wages; foreign prisoners returned; oil surplus; falling petrol prices; etc.
227 2018-12-24 23:24:47 We can never know for sure if he did know what he was given was incorrect. But, all the evidence we have suggests the contrary, and most of the blame should instead lie with Bush and his lust for oil. Blair’s mistake in my view was willingly capitulating to any US...
228 2018-12-24 23:24:45 Broo im fitting to dip my hand into some oil rn to get out of work
229 2018-12-24 23:24:45 wow I really just put lemon juice and olive oil on some spinach and carrots and fried two eggs to put atop and said “yes this is a meal”
230 2018-12-24 23:24:42 Today’s family discussion. CBD oil? Is it real? What is it ?
231 2018-12-24 23:24:41 What??? Oil just hit another low today at $42 per barrel. We are swimming in it. The price of gas is down every day for the last 60 days. What world are you living in?
232 2018-12-24 23:24:37 Two vehicles broke down just between phila and Nct. All you college girls going home gotta check ya oil and stop ignoring funny noises by blasting cardi b
233 2018-12-24 23:24:30 They have committed every crime known to man. The reason being they have keep any other forms of energy being able to replace oil. MURDER IS THERE TRADE MARK

239 2018-12-24 23:22:42 …冗談じゃねぇ…
WON-TECから支給されたDiablo-zeta……
Light-oilを入れたら止まっちまった……
壊れちまったRadioControlCarみたいにピクリとも動かねぇ……
……殺ったのか？……俺が？
240 2018-12-24 23:22:31 Each car has the oil it takes, not necessarily by make but the codes are 0W40, 5W30 etc.  You need to look in the manual (if you have it) or Google the year, make and model to know the correct one before you buy.  Wrong oil can damage the engine.
241 2018-12-24 23:22:28 Nothing special. Usually rub it down with olive oil and treager prime rib rub the night before. Wrap in foil and put it in the fridge. 500 for 15 minutes on each side then 190-200 for 6 hrs or until done to your taste.
242 2018-12-24 23:22:06 December 12th the Germans had to cut oil requirements to their own navy by 50% while handing over 90,000 tons to the Italians which I imagine facilitated the change of tactics to fleet escort.  Darlan around this time started providing intel to the Germans on RN dispositions.
243 2018-12-24 23:21:41 how does my stepmom get even CHILLI to taste like coconut oil
244 2018-12-24 23:21:27 @JesseForbey so according to FDA nbev can't sell their cbd drinks and oil shots in all 59 states and globally oversees until FDA approves?
245 2018-12-24 23:21:24 Coconut oil can help too, its all natural
246 2018-12-24 23:21:24 Which one gets the oil?
247 2018-12-24 23:21:22 Got a oil change my Shit zooom now
248 2018-12-24 23:21:12 Walau tak sebanyak oil pelumas...
249 2018-12-24 23:20:57 Gold is money, oil is oil ... a commodity.  Language and definitions are important to distinguish between facts and fiction. Yes, the price of oil is moving, the reason is not that the value of gold is moving. Gold is the reference point!
250 2018-12-24 23:20:44 Don't blame the oil companies the blame is on the upper echelon and that is what you will get here if you keep supporting the left.  Good luck with that.  Hopefully by then I will be off this earth.  WISE UP PEOPLE.

253 2018-12-24 23:20:34 People know the Great Depression, Nixon Oil shock, Dot-com bubble, 2008 global meltdown. And right now, there's a 2018 TRUMP shock, WALL shock, right before the Christmas eve.
Investors: be greedy when others are fearful.
254 2018-12-24 23:20:25 My mom rubs whatever she wants to use to kill them with anointing oil
255 2018-12-24 23:20:15 Oh my Jesus Christ...! Five more hours left and its the official Merry Christmas celebration. Have to be ready for my part at my midnight..... Enjoy drinking pop and water not alcohol nor cannabis oil.
256 2018-12-24 23:20:15 كلكن بتحبوني يعني ما تلطشو كلام صارحوني ههههههه
257 2018-12-24 23:20:12 I think the thing is filled with genuine snake oil in it.
258 2018-12-24 23:20:10 Essential oil won't like stain it or anything?
259 2018-12-24 23:19:51 Can you also please let me know the subsidy burden from 2012-2016 ?
Before 2014, MMS governement shelled out huge subsidies, payment for Iran was pending and upto 2L Crore oil bonds were issues to OMC. There are being cleared now, keeping the price lower than 2013 rates
260 2018-12-24 23:19:50 Try Brussels sprouts sliced, baked in olive oil with bacon bits and Parmesan sprinkled on top....
261 2018-12-24 23:19:09 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
262 2018-12-24 23:19:02 Best to make a 50/50 mix of isopropyl alcohol and water. Put it in a spray bottle. Add a little essential oil if you want a scent
263 2018-12-24 23:18:59 got halfway through making brownies only to discover there is not a single drop of oil in this goddamn house and for some reason no one told me that when I went to the grocery store YESTERDAY???? I am so livid rn
264 2018-12-24 23:18:55 The densities of the two water masses are so different (like oil and water) that it’s very difficult for them to mix and stay mixed. Density differences largely due to temp and/salinity.

270 2018-12-24 23:17:40 Turkey isn’t going to fight Isis. When Isis controlled most of Syria’s N. border, US then pleaded Turkey to fight Isis and stop the flow of foreign jihadi fighters  but it was ignored by Turkey. Turks & Isis had very cordial relationship and bought Isis oil. Stop spreading lies!
271 2018-12-24 23:17:32 Thanks for the Christmas presents of Carbon Tax, Migration Pact, closure of oil pipelines, historic deficit spending and support of terrorist organizations. You have truly made this an unforgettable Christmas. I wish you and your terrorist Liberal Ministers a Merry Christmas
272 2018-12-24 23:17:31 I hope people dont apply this same reasoning to oil because that would cause an economic disaster
273 2018-12-24 23:17:29 Preg para los de campo

275 2018-12-24 23:17:14 My grandma was talking about how they got some CBD oil and my grandpa goes “yeah we’re some druggies now” 
276 2018-12-24 23:17:00 If allopathy & Homeopathy fail, our native Ayurveda can certainly do all Indian diseases. Its a peculiar Indian specific phenomenon. Hence Ayurveda alone can cure it.
Soaking the head in Castor oil for a week will bring excellent results. Enema too can be given with same Oil.
277 2018-12-24 23:16:52 $NBEV so what's up with FDA?Is nbev allowed to sell their cbd drinks and oil shots in all 50 states and globally now that Trump signed law?
278 2018-12-24 23:16:50 Easy: fennel, red onion, some beets, carrots, parsnips - brown in olive oil, then add kosher salt and thyme and roast at 400 for about 45. Winter goodness.

281 2018-12-24 23:16:25 Cruiser 325 tons of gasoline in jerry cans, destroyer could carry 95 tons of fuels. Not to mention reading between the lines the spare capacity of oil in the cruisers bunkers would be pumped out in Libya. Interestingly the Italians switched tactics shortly afterwards.
282 2018-12-24 23:16:16 We read that as 

Oil oil oil. 

And it’s true. Gary’s chain does need oiling. He likes that dry lube stuff. Doesn’t stain.
283 2018-12-24 23:16:08 they fucked up by nationalising their oil company, the biggest contributor to the nations economy. they lost about 50% in productivity because of governmental ineficensy
284 2018-12-24 23:16:01 it’s christmas eve babe, on the oil rig 
285 2018-12-24 23:15:08 So this would be like something that meets our FDA standards fails the Muslim one, so you would not eat it, but the haters would.  That's like insisting on motor oil with no mil spec on it.  Legal to sell but the Army won't use it.

291 2018-12-24 23:13:09 Exactly! It is favorable to us, but for those in the oil industry, it is killing them. In Alaska, the pipelines are barely moving oil right now & layoffs are skyrocketing. It even got so bad that about a year ago, their State Legislature was considering instituting an income tax
292 2018-12-24 23:13:03 Venezuelan oil is too heavy to be used for fuel (efficiently).
293 2018-12-24 23:12:58 *Grandmas country club freind who is over*
So to fix my dogs seizures another women from the club said to use CBD oil. Do you guys know what that is? It comes from (whispers) cannabis. *all women gasp* 
294 2018-12-24 23:12:54 Yup contributions from gas station employees count as "Big Oil contributions" in the eyes of so called progressives
295 2018-12-24 23:12:33 Take some oregano oil. You’ll be fine.
296 2018-12-24 23:12:28 You r talking about specialization & I’m talking about doing what we need to do. If we need to farm for food we farm. If we need to press oil for cooking oil, we press oil. If we need fuel we focus on producing fuel. Not following some set standard of life determined by theory
297 2018-12-24 23:12:17 Sorry. I saw Atlanta, Georgia and then beach so...hence the response. From ATL it would be a 5 hour drive to the beach.

I live in CA near LAX. About 10 minutes from several beaches. The only downfall to living in a coastal city in CA is offshore oil drilling & housing costs.
298 2018-12-24 23:12:10 Bio oil
299 2018-12-24 23:12:07 We all chasing paper rectangles that don’t hold no value if it wasn’t for Oil  meanwhile we keep sending our people to fight wars to “fight” for the meaning of our paper rectangles 
300 2018-12-24 23:12:04 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
301 2018-12-24 23:11:51 I’m 90% cash, 5% gold miners, 5% oil stocks. Does that answer your question? Once market trend reverses back up, I may re-enter the market, probably later than I should. But I want a trend not just a bounce.

Cash represents a great option to (re)enter the market later.
302 2018-12-24 23:11:47 結局3時間も寝なかった
303 2018-12-24 23:11:46 If you're a gas station attendant and contributed to Beto, the BernieBros count that as Big Oil contribution
304 2018-12-24 23:11:43 Hitting the Pen at work because everybody smokes cigs and think it’s some fancy tobacco oil>>>
305 2018-12-24 23:11:42 まだ、下げるかーーマジかいw
306 2018-12-24 23:11:42 I’m regretting doing this oil treatment now. I need a nap, but this shit gonna go everywhere
307 2018-12-24 23:11:36 Why can't you leave those poor oil lobbyists alone! Wont someone think of the oil!
308 2018-12-24 23:11:35 Thirsty for adventure, here comes Taran-ish, an alchemist with a staff and a flask of oil.

Her hovel was destroyed by tarrasques and she seeks revenge.
309 2018-12-24 23:11:34 It doesn’t seem like there’s much of a discussion. It’s like “ZOMG voted w/ Trump 30%!” “ZOMG takes oil money!” without explanation from those making the claims. Without context, their only purpose is to try and take him down.
310 2018-12-24 23:11:30 just oil paint. i had a big fuck up when i was younger and did a really black oil painting and didn’t realize how hard it was to clean and slowly turned wverythjng i touched black in the bathroom and couldn’t wash it off lmao my whole tub was covered too
311 2018-12-24 23:11:19 Crude oil price is around 50-60 $ yet for petrol/diesel prices are high. The price should be less than 40₹.  This is daylight robbery, just before election this government will reduce the prices.
312 2018-12-24 23:10:36 Ha we were looking at different time scales, also was thinking about humanity as a whole, just like the existence of dinosaurs, produced crude oil reserves...
Thanks for the wise words tho.
313 2018-12-24 23:10:17 Individual donations aren't corporate donations. It makes sense that in a state where oil is a main employer that you'd find large numbers from that industry listed as donors. And by donating to him they are saying they support his policies despite where they work. Ffs people
314 2018-12-24 23:10:17 Use lame excuses for your use of oil then throw insults, great job. Why do you have a fossil burning car and an oil based phone? Do you hate the earth? OR think it's okay for you & not for others? R u a hypocrite? Insults r the last bastion of the ignorant. Keep it up. Hahaha
315 2018-12-24 23:10:13 Whack world- Tierra whack, Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides- SOPHIE, Oxnard- Anderson .Paak, Negro Swan- Blood Orange, El Mal Querer- Rosalía, FM!- Vince Staples, Be the Cowboy (obvs), Dirty Computer (again obvs), K.T.S.E.- Teyana Taylor, off the top of my head?

318 2018-12-24 23:10:03 Do American people have value? I thought you were showing interest about Middle-Eastern oil more? I am sorry... Can I have some more democracy please?
319 2018-12-24 23:09:47 @AlmostToRN2018  uses pink oil on AJ. Works great
320 2018-12-24 23:09:46 My skin is so fucked up I’ll wash it and it’ll be dry as fuuuuuck afterwards so I’ll moisturize it and it’ll get super oil by the end of the day. Where were those oils at in the beginning?? I can’t win when it comes to my skin.
321 2018-12-24 23:09:39 Whoever was behind designing Isabelle really struck oil huh
322 2018-12-24 23:09:29 Yea Bernie I know. I spent 25 yrs in construction and watched illegal immigration destroy wages. IF I was still running my business, I could hire workers for the same money I paid in 1990
Thankfully I got out,got into industry with virtually 0 illegal impact
323 2018-12-24 23:09:18 @visual hey what's up with all this FDA stuff? Nbev can still sell their cbd drinks and oil shots in all 50 states and overseas now correct?
324 2018-12-24 23:09:14 I had it for the first time yesterday at the airport and I very much enjoyed the oil/vinegar/seasoning/mayo combo.
325 2018-12-24 23:09:07 Wow oil, I love the way you move, but don’t you think this is a bit too harsh?! 
326 2018-12-24 23:09:06 so, this guy is over the top negative!? he was same way at 2016 lows, calling for a crash, 1200 SP, bankruptcies in all metals and oil stocks. stayed negative for about 40% up in his face. then, was a total bull, calling for big SP breakout end of Sept 2018.,wow
327 2018-12-24 23:09:05 Dear Santa, all I want for Christmas is motor oil, a headlight, and duct tape for the broken window (it’s a 98 Chevy Malibu)

332 2018-12-24 23:08:03 Even if he melts his face off w/ wok oil, Alli is supposed to...um...take the sous vide/insta-pot while singing Merry Poppins/Disney songs and run for the hills?
333 2018-12-24 23:08:01 What is palm oil for?
334 2018-12-24 23:07:42 The UK is a net oil exporter. Venezuela is in total economic & social collapse because socialism destroyed their oil industry. But you want to follow them.
335 2018-12-24 23:07:30 あ、無事地元帰りました
336 2018-12-24 23:07:16 I've been using CBD oil and vaping but I haven't tried caps. Do you get them locally?
337 2018-12-24 23:06:41 Dad: this sauce is smelling terrific

338 2018-12-24 23:06:36 Wouldn't qualify cbt can ibis oil for that would gve relief nothing doesn't get off head lik normal UK worlds biggest supplier  when was government going say somthing
339 2018-12-24 23:06:27 Most plastic bottles are 100% recyclable, they are made of PET. So that we are not doing that just has to do with oil companies wanting to sell new plastic, and we all suffer because of it. #lessplasticplease
340 2018-12-24 23:06:25 When I make my French Chocolate Pie, the crust is oat flour (made by putting raw oats in a blender), salt, butter, and a couple of crushed vanilla beans. No need for effing sunflower oil.

Time for mor eggnog :)

342 2018-12-24 23:05:42 It’s just whipped up oil lol. Ashy
343 2018-12-24 23:05:25 Whisk egg yolk with a tablespoon of olive oil and leave on hair for a few minutes before your shampoo. It makes a great hair conditioner.
344 2018-12-24 23:05:14 Everyone should see it and, subsequently, (try to) avoid products that contain palm oil.
345 2018-12-24 23:05:09 Wow. That is wrong on so many levels. You are quite ignorant about the oil industry and Texas and Beto. Good luck with your uninformed purity. Bernie is a narcissistic spoiler.
346 2018-12-24 23:04:56 the bougiest thing ive said to date is “i know i have some extra sandalwood essential oil around here”
347 2018-12-24 23:04:56 Of course is worse than oil! All ppl know about it.
348 2018-12-24 23:04:55 it’s not even butter it’s soybean oil lmao at least at the one where I work. I know it varies by location, company, etc what brand they use but that could be why
349 2018-12-24 23:04:26 Curly hair it's very completed 
You have to use specific hair comb
And eating very well and doing hair masks and oil 
I can feel you curly hair is VERY HARD i can feel you
350 2018-12-24 23:04:21 “a politician and their campaign will adopt a policy to not knowingly accept any contributions over $200 from the PACs,executives,or front groups of fossil fuel companies—companies whose primary business is the extraction,processing,distribution,or sale of oil,gas,or coal.”
351 2018-12-24 23:03:33 That's not my focus, that was Martin's focus in attempting to reinforce the view that ETH = oil because oil is "useful" vis a vis gold's apparent un-usefulness. My counterpoint about gold is that gold is also "useful" by that metric as shown by its industrial uses.
352 2018-12-24 23:03:22 50 billion in Afghanistan ?
How stupid our government is! In a no-win War!
How wasteful the government is, meddling everywhere. Do you see Afghanistan helping America? China helping ? Or any other country? US puts our people in harms way just for their damned Oil

354 2018-12-24 23:02:53 @realDonaldTrump WHY ARE WE IMPORTING CHEAP OIL FROM ARABIA  PUSHING DOWN OUR PRICE, DRILLERS LAYING OFF WORKERS, REFINERS, SHUTTING DOWN, PRICE BELOW PRODUCTION. PUTTING OUR OWN INDUSTRY OUT OF PRODUCTION - SELLING MUNITIONS TO ARABIA, WHEN THEY TURN ON US WE WILL HAVE NO OIL.
355 2018-12-24 23:02:50 I think it’s a THC oil vape; cart is short for cartridge

357 2018-12-24 23:02:31 Price of oil tanking caused some problems.
358 2018-12-24 23:02:15 Researching my wife's traditional Ozoni recipe from Kyoto. I am going to give it a shot on New Year's. If I mess it up, will fall back on a Nabe she likes. But today it's semolina spaghetti noodles w/olive oil, garlic & grilled shiitake.
359 2018-12-24 23:02:12 It teiggers people because you post it while not noting that one of the candidates took no PAC money and the tally includes individuals who are in the oil industry. Seems like a helpful piece of information purposely missing that makes me question your motivation.
360 2018-12-24 23:02:09 You are talking to a snake oil salesman. His Daddy was a crook, he is a crook, and most of his children are crooks. I really don't think he cares if it's legal or a lie. He is selling to his base and nothing more.
361 2018-12-24 23:02:09 Yes, the return is still the fill. There are filler caps that have both an oil fill and an oil cooler return port.
362 2018-12-24 23:02:06 Cvs has coconut oil in jars. Looks more like crisco but it's great
363 2018-12-24 23:02:04 We expanded oil & gas production under

372 2018-12-24 23:00:50 Well at the current oil price in the mid 40 dollar range they might only supply tents.

374 2018-12-24 23:00:40 It's a Waitrose Christmas pudding, allegedly organic. The lemons sauce will be home made.

How does Waitrose get away with calling their mince pies 'all butter' when the ingredients say '16% butter'. How is that 'all buttar ? There's sunflower oil in the ingredients list!
375 2018-12-24 23:00:38 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.
376 2018-12-24 23:00:35 Sorry I should have asked how gullible you are? Why would an industry that stands to benefit financially be the honest one in the situation. The PM also stands to benefit from oil $ but he can see its not the future.

379 2018-12-24 23:00:19 I don't disagree that polls are for dogs, but I think most Quebecers (and other Canadians) prefer oil from Canada instead of Saudi Arabia.  Don't you agree it's better to keep the $$ here rather than giving it to Saudi dictators who ship oil across the ocean?

382 2018-12-24 22:59:43 This above is simply not true.

Just because Alberta is having a predictable hissy fit, it doesn't mean anyone has committed treason.

More has to happen that the oil industry not getting everything it wants.

408 2018-12-24 22:57:04 If you are an oil company and your 2019 budget calls for $60 WTI, shouldn't you just buy futures instead of drilling? That's like a >50% IRR.

410 2018-12-24 22:56:45 They Nationalized those companies who found the oil and extracted it because these people too stupid as evidenced by Lake Maricabo alone. It’s just a cesspool now.

427 2018-12-24 22:53:51 You've been around long enough to know snake oil when you see it. Good organizations, governors, execs, coaches, support staff, athletes constantly ask in a constructive way if they're doing the right thing.

430 2018-12-24 22:53:31 Is it a declaration of mistakes or a complaint towards policies? but whatever U said R correct. it looks no one in Whitehouse  and from pentagon provides you the reasons  of intervening in other countries matters was of in US interest to control oil & minerals from the world

437 2018-12-24 22:52:29 they messed mine up but after a week of putting castor oil on them they were back to normal
438 2018-12-24 22:52:06 Relative to OTHER states, TX oil industry employment is high. And yes they were individual employees’ contributions (think I SAID that). And I used to work in the industry so my awareness is far beyond “cartoon.” Good grief - chill.
439 2018-12-24 22:51:42 BS - show us in a double blind free living population that any food provides significant and lasting metabolic change that results in sustained weightloss! When the Mayo Clinic and Harvard Health hawk snake oil we got a serious science problem in the US!
440 2018-12-24 22:51:25 All the oil and single malts (highly in demand all over the world) is obviously worthless, I mean come on, compared to Lambrini, what's it you got?
441 2018-12-24 22:51:23 Children filled with beauty weight way much more than oil

447 2018-12-24 22:50:41 A person would think that out of all these illegal wars based on total lies to secure and/or steal oil fields (Petro-Dollars) that those same governments would have at least this Christmas season, given a free jar of Vasoline to its citizens. Cause their getting SCREWED!

472 2018-12-24 22:48:05 What you are missing is that a pen pusher in the office shouldn't have to crush nuts to get cooking oil. What he is doing where he is is important enough otherwise you wouldn't have Birth Certificates or no one would be there to cure you when you fall ill.
473 2018-12-24 22:48:01 Make oil prices high again
474 2018-12-24 22:47:51 I was at the grocery store looking at olive oil, when some very average looking white man I have never seen before came up behind me and said exactly this:

"Oh, hey!  We're on the same path!"
*hand gesture*
"Opposite days!"  

He then walked down the aisle smiling... pleasantly?
475 2018-12-24 22:47:37 It’s easy. Fry a few pieces of bacon (for flavor and the oil) cut your cabbage add it to the pan with some butter and seasoning and a little water
476 2018-12-24 22:47:27 This vitamin E oil i got smell like old people lmfao
477 2018-12-24 22:47:24 Tell the you’re using a cold pressed [insert current superfood] oil in the evenings and use the word regime and they’ll never ask again.
478 2018-12-24 22:47:21 1. This above = 100% BS

BTW allegedly "welfare state" Quebec is currently in surplus, while Alberta was running deficits with $100/barrel oil and is coming to Canada cap in hand.
479 2018-12-24 22:47:18 I will get you both butler themed undies and bow ties and a bottle of baby oil, this will please me an be your uniform. XD 
480 2018-12-24 22:47:18 Typical snp reply to mention the oil. Yes am Scottish and proud
481 2018-12-24 22:47:16 As long as they are sitting at their border waiting for Isis to flee.. first the US invites itself into Syria and now every country throws sovereignty aside and and thinks they can enter Syria as they please.. and Turkey... the country who was helping Isis sell its stolen oil.
482 2018-12-24 22:46:21 Whys it look like you put baby oil on your shoulder
483 2018-12-24 22:46:17 the vet prescribed. Chewy dot com sells them for .33 cents a pill so they're cheap. I have been getting good results from CBD oil for my own arthritis and have been thinking about giving him some too. They make it for pets.
484 2018-12-24 22:46:11 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
485 2018-12-24 22:46:11 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
486 2018-12-24 22:45:55 Definitely the oil.
487 2018-12-24 22:45:52 Color-wise, yes. Fresh beet slices seasoned with salt and pepper and cooked in olive oil are are really good!
488 2018-12-24 22:45:42 It's such an intense flavor, so yeah, I don't even like touching them in most cases. However, I don't mind the remnants of olive slices removed from my pizza. That's the only way. And I like olive oil.
489 2018-12-24 22:45:39 You skin type apa? If combi, kalau double cleansing jangan pakai oil cleansing. Bcs combi tak sesuai dgn mineral oil. Pakai milk cleansing. I punya okay dah jerawat pasir kat dahi heee

500 2018-12-24 22:43:26 Unfortunately, a lot of the Dems are corrupt.

Instead of pushing M4all they are only looking to fix the ACA. Why? bc they are corrupt!!
501 2018-12-24 22:43:25 David, I love your work and a big admirer, but I think you're off base here. All he reported (in a tweet!) was that Beto was the second leading recipient of oil and gas money.  He didn't imply anything, the implications were taken up by others.

503 2018-12-24 22:43:11 Life is not about talents, it’s about doing what needs to b done to survive.

525 2018-12-24 22:39:57 I also use Scottish oats: chop onion, maybe some celery, saute in plenty of oil, add oats & toast well, then some water to soften the oats & cook briefly. Also herbs. But no egg. @sciencedawn, do u skip the cook with water step? I've been afraid to for fear oats won't soften.
526 2018-12-24 22:39:47 I usually put 5 grams of weed into coconut oil and use that if I want less potent edibles.

530 2018-12-24 22:39:34 You're a doctor of psychology and I of climate and energy. Fusion takes a long time to even produce viable cheap energy. Care to debate Mr professor? Or do you just talk things about climate to garner funds from the oil industry?
531 2018-12-24 22:39:33 their main source of income was cut by a third in cost. this is not the fault of socialism but of Capitalist markets. the only blame you could possibly put on Venezuela is that they decided to put their money from the nationalised oil to improve the citizens lives.
532 2018-12-24 22:39:22 Why? they have been trying to do an Iraq there for the last two decades. Can't have Venezuelans in control of their own oil when the US can just take it can we?
533 2018-12-24 22:39:03 It was oil from the braids it’s not that serious but oil is hard to wash out tho

Yes, America uses military to ensure flow of cheap oil.
It's wrong.
539 2018-12-24 22:37:28 This is only a thought, it is not proven. I wonder if since duck has so much fat under the ski,  if after letting it sit overnight in heavy dry rub, it can be cast iron pan fried, with no oil, providing it’s high % of fat will drip out and allow it to cook in its own grease?
540 2018-12-24 22:36:55 Shell and windenergy? That is good! I thought Shell was still only about oil and gas... How much of Shell is invested in sustainable energy and what are its plans for that?

543 2018-12-24 22:35:56 Really.. Have you tried to work with these countries? I have.. Brazil corrupt and by the way makes more planes than we do with Embraer. Venezuela is very dangerous and produces heavey oil mostly. Come we need some real options! #Brexitshambles #peoplesvote
544 2018-12-24 22:35:52 As global oil prices fell from $111 per barrel in 2014 to a low of $27 per barrel in 2016, Venezuela’s already shaky economy went into free fall. That year, GDP dropped 10 to 15 percent and inflation soared to an all-time high of 800 percent.
545 2018-12-24 22:35:51 I agree. I think oil will have to lead the market out. I think the snap is going to be violent. On Wednesday. Futures open in 25mins. We hopefully will get a clear sense if a snap back may come.

563 2018-12-24 22:32:58 Warmed olive oil is definitely a (somewhat effective) thing for ear pain, if you have a dropper. The only olive oil we had in the house growing up was a small bottle in the medicine cabinet from Boots, about 20 years old and kept for that purpose.

573 2018-12-24 22:32:01 Wow. #Sudan_revolts #SudanUprising #sudanvoices It's about time. The proxy (and local) oil wars there have been brutal.
574 2018-12-24 22:31:56 I like oil because it will stay on your skin.
575 2018-12-24 22:31:47 Promoted tweets from gazprom? Got a side oil&gas business?
576 2018-12-24 22:31:19 I don’t know how old you are but you are really stupid that what news put in your mind. So you and american people whom they think america makes the world safe instead you make war in every country to get money and sell war equipments and steal oil. So don’t say anything about SA
577 2018-12-24 22:31:05 My mechancially inclined friends in Bradenton... can anyone loan me a Jack and an oil pan?
578 2018-12-24 22:31:04 ? Are you saying Venezuela and Cuba are corrupt countries compared to the usa? Loool. Where did you get that data from? State department pres release? Or was it that independent thinktank corruption index which was funded by Shell oil who already has dibs on Venezuela's oil

582 2018-12-24 22:29:56 Have you tried filling a water bottle with very hot water and placing it on your area where cramping or apply peppermint oil to inside of wrist and taking small sniffs can work or if none of that works have an orgasm I am just kidding  thought maybe a laugh might help

586 2018-12-24 22:29:15 also if you can somehow get a cbd oil pen that can help a lot. Esp bc it’s legal
587 2018-12-24 22:29:12 I’ve just arrived at my step-sister’s cottage in the West Country. Just me here (she’s back tomoz), and I’ve brought ALL the Christmas food, plus an oil tanker’s worth of booze. Heck I’ve even brought limes, tonics, and a litre of Bombay Sapphire. #MerryChristmorose
588 2018-12-24 22:29:03 I imagine the sugar content of the marinade would be an issue for you .. but you can do something similar with mustard, oil and salt :)

594 2018-12-24 22:28:52 When oil and money are involved the US has no ‘law and order’ and the Saudis are like gangsters! Both US and Saudi team up with another terrorist nation to pick on peaceful nations.

597 2018-12-24 22:28:19 I'm saving up for that old fashioned oil painting of myself holding a hunting musket to hang over the fireplace.
598 2018-12-24 22:28:18 Beto promoting the exploitation and export of LNG is not counter to that goal. LNG is, without a doubt, the bridge fuel that will transition the world from oil and coal to renewables.
599 2018-12-24 22:28:14 Pink: How about a comment on nationalizing your failing oil industry. Its not oligarchs, its price controls, nationalizing everything, the word profit is evil. Central Govt control always produces an inefficient mess of NO supply, hence higher prices.
600 2018-12-24 22:28:08 if ANYONE knows where i can get an essential oil or candle that smells like yeast rolls id appreciate it if u would dm me so i can make my room into a bakery no super sweey scents please

607 2018-12-24 22:27:31 Preheat the oven to 500 and put a pan in there. Chop them in half and toss with olive oil, salt, pepper. Put them on the pan (carefully) and bake for like half an hour or until half burned. You’re welcome

612 2018-12-24 22:26:47 Would olive oil work for this too? Or would the low smoke point cause issues?
613 2018-12-24 22:26:41 Hey man, I saw your doc on climate change. We need to create a force of change that becomes irreversible. Like big oil and other conglomerates. We need to show them that we will not take anyone harming this planet anymore!! Thank you
for the doc!!
614 2018-12-24 22:26:41 Why this great country that is 5000 miles away makes war in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan? What is it's navy doing in Persian gulf? Why it steals oil?
615 2018-12-24 22:26:41 like the daily tabloids that say that Elvis is still alive and any attempt to try and get readers. also do you realize that the economic situation of Venezuela was an effect of the market price for oil dropping, which also caused a recession in Russia and Saudi Arabia.

625 2018-12-24 22:25:17 Do oil diffusers count as humidifiers?  Do I need to buy a new humidifier?
626 2018-12-24 22:25:09 Given the mess made, and left, by land based mining, why would anyone trust the mining companies to mine the sea floor without destroying our amazing marine environment. What’s next, oil drilling on the GBR?
627 2018-12-24 22:24:54 There's no such thing as fossil fuels. Oil is renewable as it's created by the movement of the earth. It's not crushed up dinosaurs.
628 2018-12-24 22:24:43 argan oil is my fav for the face, it makes ur skin rlly even and fades scars n shit & won't clog your pores
629 2018-12-24 22:24:38 To the folks working at the oil change place on Xmas Eve that changed my oil then realized they didnt have the right oil filter and had to run across town to get it, I'm sorry
630 2018-12-24 22:24:31 I've been trying (and apparently failing) to make this argument to others who seem to care so much about the fact that some oil execs donated to Beto. Sirota's argument was off base and it is his hill to die on, I guess.
631 2018-12-24 22:24:01 Hair, hair grease so u can ask them to grease your scalp as you go. Oil sheen for the burning afterward and if u want, a scarf to sleep off the pain 
632 2018-12-24 22:23:41 Ah, my apologies: I didn't read your Tweet closely enough I'm afraid. Sadly, the only photo that I have of St John's, Downshire Hill does not show the offending item & the oil painting doesn't really reveal any more detail: more's the pity.
633 2018-12-24 22:23:39 Cashed in all my @Avis points for a fancy car this week (Infiniti Q60 coupe). It's got a wheel out of round, is bitching for an oil change and washer fluid, the inside back window has never been cleaned, and when it gets warm, it smells like pot, cigars, and cigarettes. *sigh"
634 2018-12-24 22:23:17 My refund never came thru but I did receive 3 open cans of tuna? Not even solid albacore.. and in oil?? Really dude?

637 2018-12-24 22:22:23 If any of my CO friends are wondering what I want for Christmas it’s oil :)
638 2018-12-24 22:22:16 Mental health or oil wealth??

Maybe Unite could follow Rmt into a collective campaign over 1 rota for the industry, Norway was on 2n3 back in 1978!!
639 2018-12-24 22:22:06 Let’s see, Saudi Prince MBS sells Looney Lying Donnie on an idea for getting some good press by spending some excess wealth on another oil rich nation, while Turkey backs off seizure of Trump’s Tower in Constantinople if US gives them full rights to Kurds slaughter. Got it!
640 2018-12-24 22:22:00 If i break your heart, na oil spillage

643 2018-12-24 22:21:45 @RT_Erdogan cannot be trusted. 1. He mad business with ISIS buying oil. 2. He hate Israel. 3. He is friend with Iran and will help them establish bases in Syria against Israel
644 2018-12-24 22:21:45 It's home for me all 55 years except 10.5 in the USAF.  The economy is basically stalled except for oil and gas industry. It under pays for the amount of time on the job and the amount of corporate profits. Minimum Wage service industry type jobs are available

647 2018-12-24 22:21:38 @MyTrainerBob Glad to see you have seen the carb light.  A WFPB diet with no added oil is the bomb. I was at that last Oprah show, but the weight creeped back but this past year dropped 25lbs without trying, without counting calories, no concern for portions.
648 2018-12-24 22:21:32 apparently fuel prices haven't gone down in France, despite the overall price of oil being at all time lows since forever...
649 2018-12-24 22:21:30 We are blessed with so much oil but the oil is still very expensive wetin we gain
650 2018-12-24 22:21:23 we always make homemade $hit from scratch, cannabis oil, cranberry sauce, moonshine, macaroni & cheese, punkin pie, dinner rolls - we're in tennessee ...

652 2018-12-24 22:21:01 we still need gas and oil until our energy policy changes to solar, wind, and geothermal to meet the needs of our society.

It's all about that big fat arms deal...& oil prices
656 2018-12-24 22:20:19 You could try a tea tree oil shampoo. Might help, might not. Depends on the cause of the dryness
657 2018-12-24 22:19:55 Pointing out his record is fine. As far as the oil money its like how you could point out @BernieSanders took money from Boeing, he doesnt support war. i still trust him and i still think folks working for that company should be allowed to donate to him.
658 2018-12-24 22:19:47 good news!!  baby doesn't need new tires or shocks she's fine.  and the oil change made her drive a lot smoother ig i should've done that earlier.  but last time i went way way longer without changing it and didn't notice any difference so...shruggie

661 2018-12-24 22:19:26 People buying dividend stocks based on current yields need to consider what those yields are likely to go to with the recent declines. You think an oil play is going to still give an 8 or 10 percent yield when their revenue dies?
662 2018-12-24 22:19:15 they gave themolive oil???....... what ruwatching i need to see this

668 2018-12-24 22:18:39 so if a steam engine is on santas naughty list, does that mean they get diesel oil in their stocking?

giving them coal is like putting bread in a humans stocking
669 2018-12-24 22:18:27 I'd just like to add that my brother-in-law is getting a gift of Olive oil in true Selo spirit of Christmas. So Merry Christmas particularly to @SeloSlav if it's good enough for Hogtownserb it'll be good for him as well!
670 2018-12-24 22:18:18 Jaysus, your tweet is a nasty piece of work. Supporting someone due to policies does not make them "puppet master." In clearing the field for Beto, remember he broke promise on oil money, supports Israel with eyes wide shut, & votes with GOP often. I won't vote for him.
671 2018-12-24 22:18:10 It was good to meet you at #OBaWS mate! Happy Xmas!

Heh Old Engine Oil is a beast 
672 2018-12-24 22:18:05 น่าโมโหเเทนอ่ะ
673 2018-12-24 22:17:53 If Alberta is 'in crisis' as this dumb schmuck claims, I understand it's due to the decades of putting all of it's oily dirt in one basket, and grossly under-taxing Big Oil's extractions.
674 2018-12-24 22:17:44 Once they destroy their own country their only way out is to attack others...predate on others !!! guyana ?! Exxon ?!
Maybe they wanna drill sideway into the oil ?!
675 2018-12-24 22:17:40 Her take is so hot, it burns through 8 days worth of lantern oil in an hour.
676 2018-12-24 22:17:37 True, although I think the pull out was a 2 birds with one stone situation

get Turkey back firmly into the arms of NATO and cut off Russian influence, and also back a faction that will actually allow the US to reap oil rewards
677 2018-12-24 22:17:27 I’ve heard rumors citizens of the US, which last time I checked was the world’s largest Socialist oil producer, also have opinions on urban planning. Some of them may even be on this thread!
678 2018-12-24 22:16:36 Man I have an oil diffuser in my office. The car guy in me immediately went rear diffuser on cars  you’re good 
679 2018-12-24 22:16:34 Great job. Markets are on track for the worst decline since the Great Depression. You got your wish with the price of oil in free fall. Oil companies in Texas and all over the mid west will be laying off and declaring bankruptcy. Keep up the good work.
680 2018-12-24 22:16:25 Massage .
It's been rumored if you want your boobs to grow then give them daily massages & it actually helps w/ the tissue inside your breasts. Rub it in circular motions with baby oil.
681 2018-12-24 22:16:21 Right message but good luck. Many Albertans have their heads where the sun doesn't shine. They believe because world oil use is climbing daily that will continue forever it seems.
682 2018-12-24 22:16:14 Got two new oils for my oil diffuser. One of which being Grapefruit. 
683 2018-12-24 22:16:11 I saw him as a snake oil salesman from the day he rode down the escalator. I told my husband then, he will go far by creating a media circus. I was wrong about him losing.
684 2018-12-24 22:16:10 It's a conspiracy between radio Program Directors and the oil cartels to raise both ratings and gasoline consumption.
685 2018-12-24 22:16:07 That's what I thought the last 5 or more trading sessions.  500 down a day! With PE ratios fairly low I'm having a hard time understanding.  Oil decline makes no sense 2 me.
686 2018-12-24 22:15:56 oil and gas people because that is a dominant part of the economy. But he also got lots (probably more) of donations from people that were opposed to oil and gas. So who wins? What matters is his policy, not donations. And as much as I am for alternative energy,
687 2018-12-24 22:15:45 What of palm oil?

691 2018-12-24 22:14:52 So they could join the army and get killed for oil in the Middle East. But show their bodies for cash? Can’t have that!
692 2018-12-24 22:14:45 Cold boiled (not parboiled) potatoes and red hot oil, preferably animal fat though olive oil does surprisingly well too.
693 2018-12-24 22:14:40 I hear you, but he also took a lot of oil money and voted with Republicans quite a bit.
694 2018-12-24 22:14:20 Hi Mark,I find it notable that you do not engage in personal attacks and continue to argue your point of view.I disagree with you on oil, but this is my first conversation with a pipeline supporter that did not devolve into name calling. Good on you. Wishing you a Merry Christmas
695 2018-12-24 22:14:06 Mulvaney is a combination of the proverbial snake oil salesman and Trump apologist. He left himself an out by saying that he was on a 4 month trial period in his new position.

699 2018-12-24 22:13:41 Oil is going down far faster than stocks. At this pace WTI is going to 35 in a few weeks.
700 2018-12-24 22:13:33 with oil under $45/barrel, there should be some evidence now; why populate deserts, when so much unused land exists, find wells, aid in building the plants necessary for desalination but the initiative must start with government in nations in need
701 2018-12-24 22:13:18 just spilled hot oil on my foot so uno how it is
702 2018-12-24 22:13:18 Not sure if this is sarcasm or not. Russia depends on oil for government revenue.  Oil is below $50 a barrel which really hurts the Russian economy.  Best way to distract Russian people from a bad economy -- play the victim, invent a bad guy.  Do what Trump is doing in the US
703 2018-12-24 22:13:12 The last time oil went this low over 85K people were looking for new work. I was one of them. Not good.
704 2018-12-24 22:13:10 2.20 here in TN but its gone down pretty good. 
I still dont get all those dumb ass 'experts' that say low oil and gas prices are bad for the economy. Its bullshit, less money we spend on gas more money for other shit we can buy.
705 2018-12-24 22:13:09 Oh!, Y’all ain’t gon’ BELIEVE where I learned Palm Trees  come from!!,,.,The Nile Valley baby.., and I’m talking RIGHT there where our Kings and Queens lived - ruling over this World.,.from where? - The Nile Valley  So dope oh and that’s where Palm Oil comes 4rm

707 2018-12-24 22:12:51 H & J expects Oil Futures to breakout upward sometime in the middle of 2020.
708 2018-12-24 22:12:50 Didn't members of Erdogan's family buy oil from ISIS and support their caliphate? It seems I can remember convoys of tanker trucks heading into Turkey with ISIS oil. Who is Erdogan kidding?  Is this decision in the best interest of America & her allies or the Axis of Repression?
709 2018-12-24 22:12:43 Be safe out there jit RT @_yrbteezy: Auntie and Unc got me on this oil early
710 2018-12-24 22:12:24 Okay Twitter, can I use vegetable oil if a recipe calls for shortening? I usually use butter but of course that's the one thing I forgot.
711 2018-12-24 22:12:13 shes clean and smells like macadamia nut bc of this oil i use
712 2018-12-24 22:12:02 I have frozen turkey. I have rice. I have vegetable oil. I sha don't know how to cook. If nobody turn up tomorrow na to fry am chop
713 2018-12-24 22:12:01 But did he oil up for it?
714 2018-12-24 22:11:48 They have infiltrated your army 
It is well
We will be needing that oil sooner than anticipated
715 2018-12-24 22:11:47 Auntie and Unc got me on this oil early
716 2018-12-24 22:11:36 انا مش عارفه كنت هعيش ازاي من غير ال baby oil 
717 2018-12-24 22:11:33 Please don't be like that. Oil money buys air time in TX. Bernie can be pure as you want in VT.
718 2018-12-24 22:11:23 im not 100% loyal to coconut oil yet but it's been good so far even with my oily skin as well, take my tweet as bad advice
719 2018-12-24 22:10:45 As far as hemp derived cbd goes, full spectrum or nothing. Isolate is straight snake oil imo
720 2018-12-24 22:10:40 I think I need to get back to sender oil from the church I can’t do this. I can’t lie sometimes the way they show love is c*te
721 2018-12-24 22:10:37 Lots of people suggested Mayo. I know!?!  Something about the oil and egg protein. :/
722 2018-12-24 22:10:25 Is it sold as xmg per drop? The doseage is 1-5mg per 10lb of bodyweight ish. So the cat's one is 0.62 cbd per drop & Badger's is 2.5mg per drop. Suspended in either bran or olive or hemp oil. I honestly don't know how vape cbd works vs oral oil.

726 2018-12-24 22:09:45 Was arguing with a really delusional $TSLA bull on reddit today who thinks that this entire market correction is a conspiracy by Big Oil to kill electric vehicles by somehow making the general populace too poor to afford them.
727 2018-12-24 22:09:44 anyone else go from changing oil, to vacuuming the vehicle, to vacuuming every vehicle because the shop vac is out, to dusting all the beeswings out (for the 10th time since harvest) to checking all the tire pressures etc. etc. ?? i could go all day 
728 2018-12-24 22:09:41 Yer an oil painting! Dundle! An oil painting, although the oil did run a bit.......
729 2018-12-24 22:09:39 this is going to follow the market, whichever direction that is. Stop pretending oil is doing its' own thing! It's clearly tied to the risk on/off sentiment of the mkt. We need a sentiment change on Jan 1st with fresh money coming back in.
730 2018-12-24 22:09:23 Speak for yourself! How do you get elected in TX w/o Oil contribution? Nice for Bernie to be a purist...

BJP govt under PM Modi has inaugurated the Paradip Oil Refinery & laid the foundation of Paradip- Hyderabad pipeline of Indian Oil Corp which will not only strengthen Odisha’s energy sector but will also boost employment & investment in the region

734 2018-12-24 22:08:17 If Trump had not played with the dollar, oil prices and international trade with the sole purpose of satisfying a low ceiling electorate, there would be no shutdown and the stock market would not plunge...
735 2018-12-24 22:07:39 Stir fry Veggie  Chicken!

736 2018-12-24 22:07:26 Have you had their dipping oil? That deserves all the glam
737 2018-12-24 22:07:21 Here in Southern California it is very dry & I found baby oil every night has helped greatly
738 2018-12-24 22:06:38 Oh no, I’m going to try to force the elimination of all combustion engine cars. They make air pollution, noise pollution, and when they inevitably leak oil, water pollution. BEVs may not be perfect, but they’re worlds better than ICE vehicles.
739 2018-12-24 22:06:30 I do not know..The Saudis created this mess by saying in October they could pump so much more oil etc. Now this stuff is falling 10pct per week. They need to announce another cut.
740 2018-12-24 22:06:30 The oil pipeline in Syria project shall commence. Saudi, Assad, and Putin will be walking on golden streets paved with blood.
741 2018-12-24 22:06:28 I, too, thought the new stuff was excellent. The elimination of blue oil made it perfect. We don't need blue oil.
742 2018-12-24 22:06:08 Also baby oil on stainless steel makes it look brand new
743 2018-12-24 22:06:05 No he doesn't!

All the oil was nationalized

747 2018-12-24 22:05:42 Coconut oil is where it’s at
748 2018-12-24 22:05:40 Oil and Gas is the largest employer in TX, and the donations came from individuals.
749 2018-12-24 22:05:21 Trump has always wanted to give Syria to anyone. He wants to stop spending resources in the middle east. US now pumps 11 million crude oil barrels a day. He does not care who gets it. This is so apparent because @netanyahu does care who gets it.
750 2018-12-24 22:05:14 Think tarte matte primer is the only thing that controls my oil filled face @tartecosmetics  feel free to chose me. I’m not ugly I’m just broke so your give away will let my true me out
751 2018-12-24 22:05:11 Do you have any Clove oil? It is good for tooth aches. A little goes a long way ans you can usually buy it at Walmart or Walgreens
752 2018-12-24 22:05:10 At least we haven't heard beefing about evil oil companies lately?
Silver linings.

754 2018-12-24 22:04:22 Becausevthe ozzie $ is up against the US $ and oil down ??
755 2018-12-24 22:04:15 The oil trucks were crossing to Turkey by the hundreds everyday but somehow our satellites never noticed.  Now Isis lost their oil fields no more money.
756 2018-12-24 22:04:14 Let's see ET has invested millions (1.6 million in Strickland alone) all because Tim Dunn and friends want to protect me from my mayor and school board president. How kind of them. Against oil company subsidies too? Where's the white paper on that?
757 2018-12-24 22:04:07 Finally got my oil diffuser 
758 2018-12-24 22:04:01 Time to switch and read a book about olive oil.

762 2018-12-24 22:03:03 So that they can get the oil money
763 2018-12-24 22:03:00 I smell like cinnamon & pine essential oil 
764 2018-12-24 22:02:49 sick of this lie based on a cartoon understanding of texas

while it's the biggest industry *by GDP* only a very small fraction of texans work in the oil & gas industry

fully 20% of o'rourke's 2018 donations were people giving the maximum and a clear majority of them were $200+
765 2018-12-24 22:02:47 I finally did my oil change and I feel accomplished?¿
766 2018-12-24 22:02:31 I meant an oil diffuser . I have an Elantra. Don’t think it would need one of these LOL
767 2018-12-24 22:02:28 OK, but corruption and excessive public spending could actually be the definition of Socialism... Additionally there is/was complete mismanagement of their Petro industry that fueled the economy, the drop in oil $ is relatively recent, the past decade probably averages above $75

Johnson & Johnson baby oil every night after you wash your face
773 2018-12-24 22:01:35 I brought it up bc you seem focused on the “utility” of the money (aka oil). But we don’t use copper or oil as money. Linking industrial use case to gold was your attempt to associate the two.
774 2018-12-24 22:01:33 Hahahah there are dudes who pay money for an oil that says it will help their beard grow. Could luck changing your genetics with money ya chumps
775 2018-12-24 22:01:27 ball park what do you think ave price of oil was in 2018?  i'm thinking $62-$65  @anasalhajji
776 2018-12-24 22:01:24 Moms on the essential oil wave again. Stuffy nose? Oil fixes it! Broken arm? Oils fixes it! Cancer??? Oils will fix it!
777 2018-12-24 22:01:21 おはよ～
778 2018-12-24 22:01:17 Which money did they use? Our money because we’re hooked on their oil. Nice work, sell out! How many Saudi’s were involved with 9/11? Allies?
779 2018-12-24 22:00:49 Only interested in hearing Christmas songs about taking extra CBD oil until 12/26.
780 2018-12-24 22:00:31 December 24, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.

787 2018-12-24 21:59:57 This seems like a very cute observation and definitely not oil industry-funded propaganda
788 2018-12-24 21:59:53 ハードル上げられたw・・`。*:`( ﾟдﾟ*)ｶﾞﾊｯ!!
789 2018-12-24 21:59:52 Made in Canada?  You might have a different conclusion had you taken the time to do a little research into foreign-funding of anti-Canadian oil groups. Maybe give @FairQuestions a shout.
790 2018-12-24 21:59:12 maybe some oil will calm her down
791 2018-12-24 21:58:49 as in not removing any of the stuff they used to extract the oil with in the first place, just not healthy for your lungs at all and you also just don’t know whoever made the cart unprofessionally is putting in it
792 2018-12-24 21:58:43 Good to know ya'll are concerned about oil right now when there are kids in cages, entire cities with unsafe drinking water, and school shootings every other day.

But you know, oil and OMG brown people, am I right?
793 2018-12-24 21:58:38 It's like groundnut oil yaff reduce price..  
794 2018-12-24 21:58:35 Can you make brownies with olive oil?
795 2018-12-24 21:58:32 I gave the bald pharmacist some homemade lavender oil and told him it helps hair grow.
796 2018-12-24 21:58:31 Maybe the oil is peanut based?
797 2018-12-24 21:58:22 Wars are not caused by capitalism... Tell that to the second gulf war that was entirely about raising the price of oil by destabilising supply, like the plot of a James bond movie...
798 2018-12-24 21:57:48 u forgot to spray canola oil on it before baking
799 2018-12-24 21:57:47 My car feels so much better after my oil change
800 2018-12-24 21:57:37 I put candies, a t-shirt, a dragon sheet mask (at least it looks tough LOL), lavender essential oil because he can never sleep well & hot sauce.
801 2018-12-24 21:57:06 Not that I disagree, its the collective. Confidence, Rates, Unwinding, Trade War, Petro Dollar Global Transaction %, JPY, Saudis, US becoming a net Oil & Gas Exporter, China Yuan Denominated Contracts.

Nothing like using their own legislation against them.   
If Oil is a National Security risk why arent we using methods to use alternative fuels (solar & wind) when possible?  Call me a concealed carry pissed off Dem.

808 2018-12-24 21:56:10 Lol yes how dare someone accurately report the voting record of someone who takes money from people (if executives can be considered people) within the oil and gas industry.
809 2018-12-24 21:56:07 Tried beard oil for the first time today. My beard is luxuriant but it also seems like I made out with a coconut.
810 2018-12-24 21:56:05 So you’re saying taking $11,129 from the NRA is fine but when a politician has a campaign that brought in more money than any campaign in Texas senate race history, is a politician from Texas where the oil & gas field is huge, and gets individual donations from people who work -

817 2018-12-24 21:55:11 They lie. Their budget is in deficit. Oil is around $40 a barrel. They won't lay out cash; they won't have any.

822 2018-12-24 21:54:46 It was the night before Christmas and all through the WH the Grinch, frowned in the corner, tweeting out for all to see, "Poor me, poor me, poor, poor, pitiful me!" ... While his Schlocks and barons of oil bleed down on the streets of NYC.
823 2018-12-24 21:54:36 Exxon Mobil & a seismic research company it hired to search for oil off the coast of Guyana declined on Monday to say when they might resume exploration work halted after a weekend confrontation with Venezuela's navy.
824 2018-12-24 21:54:35 Wonderful idea, and while we’re at it, we get the oil, whisky and other export values so we get a decent shot a running our own affairs. No more money to London sewer schemes, railway and underground developments...well said sir
825 2018-12-24 21:54:33 Not your tweet specifically but let me ask you: 

By what measure do you think Beto represents Progressive values? Given his Centrist bent and lack of honesty regarding Big Oil donations, why would you expect him to steal votes from Bernie if not based on his youth and looks?
826 2018-12-24 21:53:58 Very embarrassing to see the head of a National Oil Company jubilating over imported petrol. Meanwhile, refineries and petrochemicals plants under his watch are not functioning.
827 2018-12-24 21:53:36 Coconut oil, medium to hard brush and a durag 
828 2018-12-24 21:53:29 Because of lower crude oil prices in international market,  no govt mechanism is responsible for this.  Rather govt is thinking to increase excise duty again.

830 2018-12-24 21:53:14 Kim jong un must come bearing gifts this time .Their is absolutely no public sentiment for any  accommodation for a parasitic snake oil salesman like this guy. If Kim doesn't produce , then it will disincentivize the solution to a whole range issues regarding China's aggression.
831 2018-12-24 21:52:51 We used to pay people to play test. Now they've found a way to get suckers to pay to play test.

Well done them. It's clever just like Trump being elected, or RDR2 merchants, you appeal to the gullible, offer some free snake oil, and you win.

835 2018-12-24 21:52:28 Had Bernie run in Texas, he would’ve gotten a similar # of oil and gas donations. Beto didn’t take PAC money. Those were all individual donors.
836 2018-12-24 21:52:25 I have an mild allergy to people covered in fish oil. Just saying.
837 2018-12-24 21:52:18 Beto would be as bad as Trump, because he would restore Obama growth, increasing the amount of CO2. Republicans have been the only ones with the courage to tank the economy. We need a Democrat that will roll the dice on GDP, and destroy an oil company.
838 2018-12-24 21:52:10 Does @Oil_Guns_Merica know?
839 2018-12-24 21:52:00 Let’s ask @cnn why they’ll say trump caused this....
lemme guess! our tariffs on Iran oil exports? 
Should #Portland change city name to Venezuela ? Or should Venezuela change it’s name to #Portland?

843 2018-12-24 21:51:32 Ask yourself why they nixed the Green New Deal and figure it out. They would not take OIL lobbyists out of the mix.

859 2018-12-24 21:48:57 I've never used oil paints before so I can't give you any tips yet 
860 2018-12-24 21:48:24 And how much oil for cooling ?
861 2018-12-24 21:48:09 Will they protect water from oil industry? Mining ? Industries and industrial farming ?
862 2018-12-24 21:48:09 Well, Nancy’s got big boobs, and since I believe both the Grinch and Michelle are dudes, I’m sticking with Pelosi. A little duct tape and baby oil and I could make it work. 
863 2018-12-24 21:48:01 Way to look on the bright side Liz.  I'd rather have the 50K "paper loss" back.  Plus, it's still bad news for oil stocks.  Can't time it though, just gotta buy sound investments that we're comfortable holding.
864 2018-12-24 21:47:56 Being at Lucas Oil Stadium, one thing that stood out was the crowd. With the score 17-7 at half and their season on the line, the Colts going into the tunnel were not vociferously booed by their fans at all. If the situation were reversed, the crowd would have lost their mind.
865 2018-12-24 21:47:50 1-2) Consider these indexes together: Global debt= Nearly $184 trillions/Global GDP= almost half of the debt something nearly $80-90 trillions/ Corporation debt= Around $9 trillions/ the market has lost more than $7 trillions of its values just in 2018/ Oil price #ShutdownStories

874 2018-12-24 21:46:22 Así que lo que hicieron las "major oil companies" fue ponerse de acuerdo con los porcentajes con cada campo licitado y que ganara la que ofreciera mayor prima de desempate, para lo cual también se podrían haber puesto de acuerdo. De esa forma estaríamos regalando energía y dinero

879 2018-12-24 21:45:24 China is and has been slowing as well! It’s just illegal for their press to say it. Check out oil prices

899 2018-12-24 21:42:13 Good luck! I don't find them difficult to make, I think people over dramatise the recipe. As long as the oil is hot and you don't open them door they will work!
900 2018-12-24 21:42:12 US crude declined 6.4% to $42.7 a barrel, reaching its lowest since August 2016 and the Brent crude dropped 6.2% to $50.5 around 02:00 PM New York time. #oil
901 2018-12-24 21:41:35 I use co2 oil in pre packed vape cartridges. Works great but pure thc is a different feeling than terpene packed flower. More intense, a bit of that paranoid feeling. I use cbd to mellow it out. Luckily ny will legalize soon! Then i can home grow something nice
902 2018-12-24 21:41:11 Looks like the tree needs to be cut into small pieces, with a touch of olive oil, salt, and pepper.

912 2018-12-24 21:40:05 In the clip you said oil in your work(going back decadea) should be btw $ 55 and $ 64 bbl, & that it was about where it should be now.  Question is, aside from US fracking and additional supply, oil is in free fall, Brent closed at 50 & WTI closed at 42.68. Why the panic selling?
913 2018-12-24 21:40:02 good riddance. we need to destroy some oil companies. not prop them up with growth.
914 2018-12-24 21:39:56 I seriously doubt the downturn will be enough to cause net YOY declines in 2019 but between Canada likely being near zero growth and now the US growth being cut likely in half...2019 gonna be very interesting for #oil from here.

945 2018-12-24 21:35:16 Moreso, substitute for oil in the world makes the demand for $CL highly reduce. In few months to come, I see the price of oil get to $33 per barrel. The price went down to this level in 2016 and 2009.

987 2018-12-24 21:28:52 Earthstone Energy Inc. (NYSE: ESTE) no longer plans to acquire assets from Corpus Christi-based Sabalo Holdings LLC. The pair called off the $950 million deal after oil prices plummeted in the fourth quarter. #oil
988 2018-12-24 21:28:50 Maybe if you would stop subsidizing the oil companies you would have the money for your wall. They make a profit and get subsidies… Go figure
989 2018-12-24 21:28:44 Except Putin is trying to corner world energy markets (Hitler lost the Ploesti oil fields to Stalin) and is just starting his campaign against the Jews (he knows Hitler did that too soon too hard). #altgov #theresistance #resist
990 2018-12-24 21:28:41 So you don't give a fuck why Beto voted against oversight of predatory lending or to lift the ban on oil exports or to allow further drilling in the gulf or why he supported Tim Ryan's challenge to Pelosi, it's just whether he did or not. Cool.
991 2018-12-24 21:28:39 When you list the goodies Russia and SA have received from Trump, please remember to include helping to destabilize global consensus on keeping oil in the ground.  I know that money seems more important right now, but once the biosphere starts to crash, we’ll know otherwise.

994 2018-12-24 21:28:30 So basically you're saying Sanders is in trouble because Beto is younger and prettier? That appears to be the gist of may pro-Beto fans.  Never mind his Centrist views, lack of Progressive ideals and lying about taking $$$ from Big Oil.
995 2018-12-24 21:28:29 Try Emu oil
996 2018-12-24 21:28:03 Venezuala isn't socialist. This is the result of America blockading the country as well as starting coups and interventionist activity to drive oil prices down, the US' main importer of oil is Venezuala.

1003 2018-12-24 21:26:14 Ohhh perfect I need my oil changed asap
1004 2018-12-24 21:26:12 I know that it’s really beside the point (and maybe misogynistic) # but the gun girl needs a better leave in conditioner and oil mask routine. Those curls are dryer than the Sahara
1005 2018-12-24 21:26:08 They’re so easy to make! I use a box of white cake mix, 1/3 cup veg oil, and 2 eggs. Mix well and shape into 1 inch wide discs (so they spread some). Bake 7 mins at 350° and let cool. Then ice and sprinkle. So yummy!
1006 2018-12-24 21:26:05 Investigative site, Sludge, found O’Rourke had received a total of $430,000 from executives in the oil and gas sector. And there was no sign or clue that he had returned the 29 different “large donations” that consisted of contributions of $200 or more from fossil fuel executives

1009 2018-12-24 21:25:43 I am all in for transparency and checking on potential conflicts of interest. Why not start The Con and move on to those elected to the new committee on climate change and their connections to oil/gas. For candidates, let's put legislation through that puts requirements into law.

1013 2018-12-24 21:25:16 Have you read the Lisbon Treaty - In 2022 we’d become an EU state, & have to give up our currency, sovereignty, nationality. No more Queen or King. Also our fishing rights become owned by EU, and all gas, oil, minerals, all EU property. Financial centres all moved to Strasbourg.

1018 2018-12-24 21:24:47 Yes but mid to late 60's didnt have the likes of oligarch with oil money.
1019 2018-12-24 21:24:47 In your opinion, what do we need to see before oil starts going back up?
1020 2018-12-24 21:24:07 Melting down the butter and oil at a lower temperature seems to quicken the kick in
1021 2018-12-24 21:23:44 exactly!!! and there’s no oil
1022 2018-12-24 21:23:42 Just curious as to how these guys keep going to Michigan State, is Izzo selling snake oil?
1023 2018-12-24 21:23:41 Been saying the same thing. And who bought into a bunch of CBD oil companies before that farm bill was announced making that shit legal?
1024 2018-12-24 21:23:32 These oil corporations don’t need to make long term plans because they know we will keep propping them up, even with all of their poor business decisions.
1025 2018-12-24 21:23:21 Bingo: "statist". 5 years ago I wrote a column pointing out the the oligarchy pays off the NRA to maintain an extremist @A position so as to keep the #FeralBase hypersensitized against *any* regulation (hint: benefits the oil industry) Hence, irrational climate change denial.
1026 2018-12-24 21:23:20 God bless the coconut oil.
1027 2018-12-24 21:23:19 i don't hate Beto, i am merely looking at his voting record i don't like it! its been terrible we need to take #ClimateAction  to stop #climatechange We don't need a man bought by Big oil who's also  pro fracking.   we need a #GreenNewDeal & other progressive policies.
1028 2018-12-24 21:22:49 okay sorry but how is olive oil, chives and parsley considered spices?????? even YT top chefs are still white as fuck!  and yes i am shading gordon ramsay

1031 2018-12-24 21:22:18 I'm no fan of oil and gas corporations. I lived in Texas most of my life. So I'm guessing you walk, take a bicycle or a horse and carriage everywhere you go now? Way to go!

The artificial truffle oil that’s usually what’s used is *worse*, but fresh truffle is not good to me either
I love mushrooms so it seemed like a natural, but no
1036 2018-12-24 21:21:54 I legit love it raw, too. with teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, sesame seeds, sesame oil, etc. prob the asian in me but 4 real it’s yum 
1037 2018-12-24 21:21:38 I think the “drizzled olive oil” and “sesame seeds” put me right over the top...
1038 2018-12-24 21:21:33 #DowJones  This is probably a good thing, considering that the only way to guarantee returns is through violence, physical or economic.  Maybe green stocks will keep going up and oil and war will continue to plummet.  Happy Holidays!

1042 2018-12-24 21:21:07 Bullshit! The Sunni oil sheiks just want to wipe out the Alouites and steal Syria’s oil.

1044 2018-12-24 21:20:59 So far the only thing keeping the #JCPOA alive is the #US waiver to the 8 countries that wanted to keep buying #Iranian oil. The #EU has done NOTHING other than talk some nice words about respecting international agreements.
1045 2018-12-24 21:20:41 You forgot Bahrain bail out, and oil closed below $45 today.
1046 2018-12-24 21:20:32 Canada is also seeing a significant cutback in both oil and gas.

1049 2018-12-24 21:19:40 that's not my plan. my plan is to destroy an oil company, wiping the smiles off the CEOs, creating competition instead of collusion, instilling fear in all oil employees simultaneously, causing them to scramble to shift to green technology fast, shaking off climate denial rats.
1050 2018-12-24 21:19:18 Oil!
1051 2018-12-24 21:19:14 I get it, you are into conspiracy theories and think that health professionals are the devil. I dont care about your views, but I do care about the ignorance people like you can spread. Keep the snake oil to yourself.

1053 2018-12-24 21:18:46 And yet, investor guests on @CNBC/@business are more concerned that total US production keep going up, rather than if production level off with demand.
Production goes up, #wti prices drop even more, & profits & return on oil assets goes down, may be too many players?

1060 2018-12-24 21:17:31 What does "very strongly informed" you even mean? He informed you. Period. But I guess when u spend your life as a snake oil salesman, carnival huckster you use "BIG LOUD WORDS" (best words?) to draw a crowd and hope to find a few suckers in the mix. As we watch your self-demise
1061 2018-12-24 21:17:31 "an oil company" is pretty misleading, but yeah, that pretty fucked up!

1063 2018-12-24 21:17:12 Of course you’re looking forward to another meeting with a dictator you admire & who is currently ignoring sanctions with oil and still building Nukes.
1064 2018-12-24 21:17:11 do you know how to do actual research or do you just believe without any proof what msnbc and cnn tell you? everything you said up there is true. kamala loves private prisons, beto funds campaigns with oil money, and booker is owned by wall street. google it
1065 2018-12-24 21:16:59 Like. Imagine you live in Texas and work in oil. You see the climate debate and know change may be imminent and/or necessary. You see a candidate with compassion and believe he would ensure new jobs to replace the oil and coal jobs when that change comes. You donate.

1073 2018-12-24 21:16:18 when looking at Beto's record it show's he doesn't have our best interests at heart, he's owned by Big oil, is pro fracking etc. If he runs for office again he will be "attacked" based on his voting record & more by his opponents.  We don't need a Faux progressive like beto

1077 2018-12-24 21:15:38 Oil has ZERO to do with it. Oil falling is a symptom, not a cause, just like most other assets right now.
1078 2018-12-24 21:15:31 just tried oil. please don't.

1091 2018-12-24 21:13:44 My recollection is that for the Hussein Regime to have been able to sell oil for medical supplies would have required them to transfer the oil to the same national entities making war on them.

1102 2018-12-24 21:12:18 I can agreed 100% with this. The pipeline will keep Alberta working while they figure out how to reduce economic reliance on oil/gas.

1110 2018-12-24 21:09:40 The green new deal is instead of subsidizing oil in the US you subsidize green technology which will promote a green technology wave which will be a huge economy and job booster. If you need more information try and the link I sent you.

1128 2018-12-24 21:07:57 True. The overall picture tho is other countries, including the USA, continue to build pipelines, whereas canada is in neutral. I guess that’s fine if canadians are ok with foregoing the considerable revenue from our own oil. Are we saving anything by replacing that with imports?
1129 2018-12-24 21:07:53 Surprise! POTUS stands for Big Oil but disses the FED? Guess we know why he denies Man-Made Climate Change... it's because BIG OIL is responsible and they are not human.  WE all know the FED is illegal and WAll Street is a huge monopoly game that converts their play to real $$$
1130 2018-12-24 21:07:33 It was horse shit, a oil stock took off at 9am but had a 25-1 reverse split scheduled for noon and I couldn’t trade it. Fucking horse shit.

1148 2018-12-24 21:05:21 Beto doesn’t even support M4A, the most baseline thing you should support on the left in this election. It even polls over 50% with registered Republicans. He takes most of his political donations from the Texas oil industry. He’s not the most progressive whatsoever.
1149 2018-12-24 21:05:18 Holy moly. Fresh shiitake mushrooms sauteed in salted garlic and olive oil is like the vegan lobster in butter. 

I'm going to figure out how to pair that with a Beyond Meat burger and portabella for a steak and lobster like experience.

1151 2018-12-24 21:04:44 Thank you for your unyielding commitment to reliable reporting of news and in-depth analysis of the oil & gas and the fracking industry.
1152 2018-12-24 21:04:33 To be fair mate, Whilst I support you in principle, We should not be using anyone's oil. It is well past time to switch to renewables.
1153 2018-12-24 21:04:30 I have drops of the oil and maybe it's the taste that makes me pass out. I DUNNO TREAT YO'SELF
1154 2018-12-24 21:04:22 I'm foreign and not great at yorkies  but I think the hot oil and hot pan thing is crucial to not ending up with a pancake muffin... not sure that would work with a silicon pan.. any thoughts @BeezzzzzBee @coolestofcats
1155 2018-12-24 21:04:17 Do you think we saw a capitulation bottom on oil today? 4%+ of the 6% drop was in last ten minutes of trade? This felt like a bottom to me...
1156 2018-12-24 21:03:38 I am with you on all three. Would be wonderful  to see higher taxes and tariffs on all canola oil production as canola consumption increases future HeathCare costs as it real is an unhealthy  garbage oil not worthy to be produced in a great nation.

1176 2018-12-24 21:00:02 Nope, but it is worth it to break Putin. He controls the oil cartel and him being brought down is worth it in the long run.  We Texans take care of each other.

Crisis create strong changes in prices like oil, stocks, houses.

1210 2018-12-24 20:54:45 Have you read the Lisbon Treaty - In 2022 we’d become an EU state, & have to give up our currency, sovereignty, nationality. No more Queen or King. Also our fishing rights become owned by EU, and all gas, oil, minerals, all EU property. Financial centres all moved to Strasbourg.
1211 2018-12-24 20:54:38 EUR/ USD impacts broad real effective exchange rate (RER), broad RER clearly connected to the overall trade deficit ex oil.   If don't trust me, look at the Fed's trade model.    EUR/ USD impacts bilateral trade, but also sales in third party markets.
1212 2018-12-24 20:54:36 Come April-May monster rally...reduced rigs, greater than expected gasoline draws, and OPEC panicking should see oil stocks rebound violently to upside

1215 2018-12-24 20:54:15 I would bet $200 that some of Beto's under $200 donations came from people who earn their living in oil fields. That hardly makes them corporate scum trying to buy a congressman.
1216 2018-12-24 20:53:48 Sunflower oil? Who does this?!?

I've never cooked with it. Why sunflower oil?

I do a lot with avocado oil because of the high score point.
1217 2018-12-24 20:53:46 12 almonds daily should help + lavender oil on the temples at night.

1224 2018-12-24 20:52:30 The President has said the Saudis will be spending hundreds of billions of dollars buying military equipment. He also asked them to keep the price of oil down. But the Saudi's can't break even with oil prices so low. So how are they going to pay us for the military equipment?
1225 2018-12-24 20:52:28 Look at the numbers, it’s a minuscule amount.  3b for an entire year of oil, less than some small cap American frackers.  Diamonds far less.  This is entirely a religious and geopolitical conflict.

1247 2018-12-24 20:48:58 The selling momentum is consistent with a bearish strong trend with the day closing at a near 6% fall for crude oil. In the last 50 trade sessions crude prices have corrected an average 0.92% per day!
1248 2018-12-24 20:48:56 Went into work today just so I could inform a little Asian lady that drove her car with a severe oil leak that it was going to cost $8k to fix it. She almost cried and i felt like Satan. Merry Christmas Eve!

1254 2018-12-24 20:48:11 @Chevron @BP_America @ampm @exxonmobil @Shell
Oil falls quick, gas station price fall slowly 

If they wanna raise prices , drop prices at gas station quicker to eat thru the inventory stock. To keep demand high

Can't keep complaining if don't do much

1256 2018-12-24 20:48:08 @LDLSkeptic, I agree. Chocolate as 100% cocoa powder and nibs.  Also high-quality puerh tea and sencha green tea. It's possible to keep carbs to single digits even w/these 2 plant inclusions (plus lemon or lime juice, some olive oil, curry powder, basil, ginger).
1257 2018-12-24 20:48:02 1.PDP at $142 per barrel of crude oil, 27 states couldn't pay salaries for up to 14 months ,but 
APC at $27 per barrel ,Buhari  began  bailing them out . At the last count ,he has since given all the states 3 bailout  and one Paris  club  refund.
1258 2018-12-24 20:48:00 Its Christmas eve, people are spending time with there loved ones... that fuck they are why do I have a constant line of 40 people for oil changes  go spend time at home not at Walmart!!!!
1259 2018-12-24 20:47:55 of course, @AndrewScheer and his racist, climate denying Conservatives can frig right off forever, but the Liberal party has been centre right this whole time on climate change. Stop the Kinger Morgan pipeline and stop the oil and gas bailouts in Alberta.
1260 2018-12-24 20:47:51 Lol dollar bills not notes 
1261 2018-12-24 20:47:27 & dat box be slippery like tryna walk on oil
1262 2018-12-24 20:47:17 let's focus on destroying fossil fuel's hold on us by destroying an oil company, creating a feeding frenzy that transforms all energy to zero carbon within one business cycle.

1264 2018-12-24 20:47:09 Coming off the WB #BayBridge into #SanFrancisco, solo accident has been blocking the 3rd-from-left lane, and now there's an oil slick in the THREE left lanes that Caltrans will need to clean up. Traffic is backing up toward Treasure Island. EB-80 is solid from 101 to 1st Street.
1265 2018-12-24 20:46:54 Hydrogen doesn't have anywhere near the energy density required to be a practical replacement for liquid fuels. Until hydrogen can be efficiently extracted from water, not from oil, it has limited potential.
1266 2018-12-24 20:46:35 To ALL the people criticizing Beto/Bernie or ANYone else for accepting contributions from the employees of oil companies...

There are roughly 250,000 employees between these companies. Why are THEY not allowed to contribute to their favorite candidates?

WTF IS this?
1267 2018-12-24 20:46:34 i got a weighted blanket and an essential oil diffuser. therapy who

1270 2018-12-24 20:46:24 Yes, Amarjeet Sohi, Climate Change is real, which is why I'm also baffled as to why you and the Liberal Party decided to invest 1.6 billion in to Alberta oil and gas. Bailing out fossil fuels when we need to be weening off of them undermines our climate goals.
1271 2018-12-24 20:46:23 Does he understand why coal was tsken over by gas and oil. Perhaps we shd change our laws on asbestos,  radon , mold etc. He's a REALTOR. Although who really knows with the LIAR.

1274 2018-12-24 20:46:06 it’s not even 4 pm and i am two gin martinis deep, by what time will i be in a fight with my mother?
1275 2018-12-24 20:46:04 Collect your jars of mayo or those glass jars of tomato sauce and wait for the oil to cool down dump it in the jars and throw them out when they’re full
1276 2018-12-24 20:45:56 Our interest in oil rich areas has nothing to do with freedom. It has everything to do with National Security. Oil is the life blood of America. I will be thrilled when renewable energy can replace fossil fuels and we can leave the Mid East forever.
1277 2018-12-24 20:45:54 As I watch a chevron oil barge pull up and unload here. Also, not to mention a concord Phillips refinery close by. I Haven’t seen that price since the late 90’s/early 2000’s. Ahhh The perks of living in Cali... lol 
1278 2018-12-24 20:45:46 her's .She's saying that guns smell like urine?    Maybe she's using the wrong kind of oil to clean her's . . .
1279 2018-12-24 20:45:36 We need a nationalised coal and oil industry.  But we need green technologies.  For example with coal we can use clean coal technology and carbon capture.
1280 2018-12-24 20:45:33 We do not recommend supplements for people under the age of 18. Also, Fish Oil is not intended for post-workout recovery.
1281 2018-12-24 20:45:18 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1282 2018-12-24 20:45:14 Knocking Beto (a candidate from Texas, where TONS of people work in the oil industry) for having received donations from PEOPLE (not oil companies, actual PEOPLE) who work in the oil industry is ludicrous and stupid. Bernie bros (and their enablers on the far left) are the worst.
1283 2018-12-24 20:44:40 That looks like a quality rig, my wife is a fan of the waxes and shatter. She uses a torch/crystal banger rig system. This looks much safer. She gets shatter that’s 98% THC I call it crackpot. Have you used any of the CO2 oil? I hear it is pretty pure as far as chemicals go.
1284 2018-12-24 20:44:15 Also a math and french teacher. Previous PM was a mail clerk at the oil company where his Daddy worked and Scheer sold insurance. I'd rather have a teacher and this one surrounds self with / listens to highly qualified ppl.
1285 2018-12-24 20:44:15 Does that piss you off,  the oil corps get to drill oil in federal lands and received grants so we can be self sufficient but still we will be paying the same as the rest of he world
1286 2018-12-24 20:44:13 I have no 2019 oil price prediction so I'm not in the sample.
1287 2018-12-24 20:44:07 It’s why I go on an all-hardtack diet and struggle to afford oil for my single lamp all December in his literature’s honor
1288 2018-12-24 20:44:03 They murdered a resident of this country who worked as a respected journalist for the @washingtonpost.

1290 2018-12-24 20:43:58 So im doing oil change and they asked me what kind of oil. I almost said vegetable oil hahahahahahahah
1291 2018-12-24 20:43:39 Dear  Ghanaian Santa. you supplied me with gold, oil,& diamonds by the boat load. 2nd boat was cocoa beans, cashews , mangos and pineapples. last year. this year i want a  harbor port. so can, ship items across the globe. plus bless the Mrs from Volta Region with some treats.
1292 2018-12-24 20:43:37 Continue to hope on oil
1293 2018-12-24 20:43:31 Dollar notes 
1294 2018-12-24 20:43:30 Done. It's ridiculous they prices go up instantly in reaction to oil, but take wayyyyy too long to come down, and probably don't come down enough
1295 2018-12-24 20:43:30 I'm so glad I got my oil rn. The fucking engine is worth more than the car!
1296 2018-12-24 20:43:27 You don’t need to be on the payroll to be an ally of those trying to keep our oil landlocked. E May for example, I doubt she is on the payroll but she is so blinded by her agenda to kill our oil sector she is willing to work with anyone to get it done.
1297 2018-12-24 20:43:16 You should put essentiel oïl is better than the rest

1299 2018-12-24 20:43:05 You should talk to @daveanthony about him Rob, you just might be crushed by the amount of times you hear ‘oil’ and ‘money’. Better to know the truth though right?

1301 2018-12-24 20:42:46 SA, Israel, Egypt, Jordan have formed a strong alliance to stabilize the region. Where & how the pipeline progresses is relevant to those who live there. US has it's own massive oil supply, has gained energy independence, & is the world's largest supplier of energy.

1302 2018-12-24 20:42:45 Get some oil on a paper towel or something & scrub it
1303 2018-12-24 20:42:44 What happened to your prediction oil will stabilize 55-60 by year end? Lol
1304 2018-12-24 20:42:18 First palm oil can’t be grown in the UK anyways. And I didn’t say you can’t still grow some crops but you don’t need all that land for crops since you can produce over 6000 lbs per 1/10th an acre. Would be nice to rewild England. Bring back predators
1305 2018-12-24 20:42:05 Biden was against busing desegregation and made it harder to dump student loan debt. Harris wanted to throw low income minority parents in jail for truancy. Beto voted in favor of oil companies. HARD NO! Get informed.
1306 2018-12-24 20:42:03 Him, and the entire F'n Fin Adv. industry who hyped him as Motor Oil of the Gods 'til markets hit the slicks. IALTO. Fortunately it was all fairly transparent, tho seductive I'm sure.
1307 2018-12-24 20:42:03 I bought a shit load of almond oil, jojoba oil, hemp oil and essential oils.... I'm stocked for the winter
1308 2018-12-24 20:41:53 The only problem our economy has is a Fiat worthless Petro-Dollar. With China's launch of the gold backed oil contracts, we are in an asset backed economy.  Time to #EndTheFed and bring back the Gold Standard.

1313 2018-12-24 20:41:02 In a Greedy world of take, take, take and the enormous monster called Palm Oil which is consuming the rain forests of East Asia at an unprecedented rate, companies like Cadbury can only see profit and really couldn't care less about anyone or anything. It disgust me too, but 
1314 2018-12-24 20:40:52 Where’s my my castor oil please!.... I need a trim I forgot omg 
1315 2018-12-24 20:40:32 Exactly. Sitting next to Obama at a dinner party would be too much fun.

But many of his policies and outcomes--

Millions of Black families losing homes in foreclosure

Hundreds of Black people summarily executed by cops

Fracking, oil & gas policies--

sucked.

1320 2018-12-24 20:39:58 Yep, strange but true. The US now produces more oil for export than it imports.
1321 2018-12-24 20:39:48 #DnD ring of fire resistance plus flammable oil and light it. Great attack mode. Gives Flaming Man a whole new slant.
1322 2018-12-24 20:39:40 Ok.. sensed some sarcasm, my mistake

All in the hands of the media now. What’s more important - staining Trump with negative headlines or the US economy 

Guess we’ll see. Agree oil can’t go much lower without a fresh panic there
1323 2018-12-24 20:39:33 Oponu ni yin sir. For an oil producing state, this is an achievement abi
1324 2018-12-24 20:39:29 oil  42.68  wow
1325 2018-12-24 20:39:12 Fish oil
1326 2018-12-24 20:39:10 It’s likely a Saudi owned company. Hint: its business is oil, making oily dealings.
1327 2018-12-24 20:39:05 Would be nice if that was the case,  but unless USA nationalizes the American oil industry the prices will rise with the world price,  only American dollar will drop dramatically without world oil sales,  said and done, next year we could see $10 per gallon gas,  maybe twice that
1328 2018-12-24 20:38:42 Castor oil
1329 2018-12-24 20:38:39 Anyone who thinks there isn’t a concerted effort by special interest groups to keep our oil landlocked is just being naive. CDN energy policies must be decided by CDN’s and not be influenced by outside forces.
1330 2018-12-24 20:38:31 Nobody is buying because politico has kept our oil landlocked  and there is just not enough rail road capacity to move it.
1331 2018-12-24 20:38:03 Bitcoin works because it has no physical counterpart. It is self-contained and self-referential within Bitcoin's p2p network. You can't convert an oil barrel into digital form unlike Money. Some think supply chain + block chain is a good usecase because of common word "chain"
1332 2018-12-24 20:37:59 I wouldn’t just yet. Not until we get more clarity on shutdown negotiations. The Fed speaks again early January too. I’m watching US data closely as well as China data. May wanna keep an eye on Oil prices & Brexit. This isn’t a flash crash, this has some substance to it.

1349 2018-12-24 20:35:00 If the oil was there at tide water tankers would be loading it. Incompetence of our leaders has created the problem. Trudeau, Horgan & Weaver being the worst of that group.
1350 2018-12-24 20:34:53 In fact, if you’ve never seen Henry in a loin cloth and banana oil then you can’t really claim to know him at all.
1351 2018-12-24 20:34:53 Look for it for hours. Pour palm oil where the figures are and tell him you left it in the kitchen and forgot to put it in a proper place.

If he finds out, just be honest and tell him to increase your allowance so you won't be looting money .
1352 2018-12-24 20:34:43 Please PLEASE come at me if you want to talk about oil and gas. I’ve only spent 15yrs trading it.
1353 2018-12-24 20:34:43 Everyone of these people should have to turn in their cars and buy a bicycle. Then let’s see how quick they are to denigrate oil and the money given to help other provinces..right Quebec?

1358 2018-12-24 20:34:00 We have actually been sending OUR troops to fight for other countries, when the oil money from their most successful countries could easily have  been paying for, and fighting their own battles. We have been played for suckers for too long! Pres Trump is ending it!
1359 2018-12-24 20:33:59 I had my reasons for not watching Binging with Babish anymore but I tune back in and, yo, this dude made aioli with fuckin' canola oil and I screamed at the monitor, "NO, THAT'S MAYONAISSE!"
1360 2018-12-24 20:33:55 shout out to hash oil
1361 2018-12-24 20:33:47 You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it
1362 2018-12-24 20:33:45 Better than seeing Citeh buying it again though mate. At LFC and your lot would win it without the oil rich sugar daddy owners
1363 2018-12-24 20:33:39 Correct they have the worlds largest proven oil reserves..

Unfortunately, due to mismanagement by the government the PDVSA barely pumps enough to keep its largest refinery running at minimum out. 

It relies on assistance from the (capitalist) oil majors..

1369 2018-12-24 20:33:01 And it’s straight up theft. That oil belongs to us, not the oil companies. A fire sale that doesn’t include much of anything for struggling Albertans. They buy the rights, but it shouldn’t be at the cost of our rights.

1376 2018-12-24 20:32:37 Wrong. When the people turn their back on the west, they choose socialism the west does not like. So they start opposing them with lots of boycotts just like the US did with Venezuela, the once richest oil country in the Caribbean. Get to know dirty politics, that's how it works

1401 2018-12-24 20:29:37 That was from individual donors who work in oil, because he’s from Texas. He didn’t take corporate money. You are holding against him that he got individual donations from people who work for Texas’ largest industry. This is blatant misconstruing of facts to fit your propaganda.

1405 2018-12-24 20:28:53 Saudi Arabia extracts its oil at a cost of 18.50 per barrel. Cheaper than anyone else. It could maintain a 35.00 per barrel price for 30 yrs before suffering economically.
1406 2018-12-24 20:28:48 No because he gave a good black lives matter 5 min speech. Everything else he did is nulled now. Whether he's with the lobbyists,  oil companies, GOP Bill's. It's his lil speech that matters.
1407 2018-12-24 20:28:44 Absolutely.  We'll have to see what his donor list looks like when/if he runs for president. And see if his policy proposals are in line with the climate challenges we face. But it's not necessarily disqualifying for a Texas pol to be a recipient of oil money
1408 2018-12-24 20:28:42 All I need for Christmas is a body rub with warm baby oil
1409 2018-12-24 20:28:36 Wow I wonder if the lack of oil coming out of Southern Sudan. Bashir supporting rebels in Southern Sudan. Has created a perfect storm situation in Sudan.
1410 2018-12-24 20:28:15 Yup, shame I can't do Smell-O-Vision. The smell of warm oil really completes the experience :)
1411 2018-12-24 20:28:13 Oil's already in the toilet, bringing more barrels onto the market... How are we supposed increase drilling in the U.S.?
1412 2018-12-24 20:28:13 Setting a new record for UNemployment  having US oil being sold overseas again. Getting the US out of a 19 yo war, lowering taxes just for a few accomplishments of our President

but how do oil paintings work?
1416 2018-12-24 20:26:58 You just have to know where to look, and what youre willing to sacrifice. They cant find enough people to work in West Texas. Oil field hires veterans faster than anybody. They look after veterans

1422 2018-12-24 20:26:13 Our interest was / is, keeping region stable enough that oil prices stay manageable. Very real risk of open war involving Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Israel. Russia, now running the show, has a national interest in higher oil prices.  You'll be paying $4 / Gallon by July.
1423 2018-12-24 20:26:09 My bf took my car to change my oil, brought it back and it's a different color....#merrychristmas
1424 2018-12-24 20:26:07 Unless we are saying all the social investment programmes,retrieving territory from bh,agric interventions..non oil export growth, systemic tools like TSA, efcc seizures etc;are lies,how can anyone say they have failed in a few years..sustainable change is a process not an event.
1425 2018-12-24 20:25:58 Solar is an agreement for 80 plus acres of panels. Very close to grid, relay station and oil pumping terminal. Pretty ideal, I would think it may go forward.

1446 2018-12-24 20:23:46 In the long runs demand will fall. The USA isn't the only player fighting for market share. All oil producers are playing the game. Those with the highest costs, like AB, will be the first ones crushed by the game.
1447 2018-12-24 20:23:43 Other countries spend 0.99 ... 1%, 3% (many NATO countries) for defense.  ME and Russia are issues for their defense and oil.  If they won't help with soldiers, they need to reimburse the USA for THEIR defense and OIL interests.
1448 2018-12-24 20:23:36 We also need clean air and drinking water, stable weather patterns, and a global economy that's not threatened by climate change.  How does pumping more oil out of the ground (so others can burn it) protect THOSE conditions?

1451 2018-12-24 20:23:11 Would the US military then have a better reason to protect OUR oil companies against greedy foreign governments?
I think we should think this nationalization through again.
1452 2018-12-24 20:23:04 No he working withPutin to take American oil supplies and Saudis in Texas get a clue.
1453 2018-12-24 20:23:03 think about the second order implications: over here in the #EU, where fuel taxes are yuuuge, there will be no consumer relief from lower oil: in the US, there could be some push from the consumer side, and a drag on the producer side. #OOTT
1454 2018-12-24 20:23:00 Buhari reformed agriculture but local rice is still #21,000.

1462 2018-12-24 20:21:55 I don’t know much about Venezuela, other than it’s a socialist country that’s dependent on Oil for its primary income.  We’re not South American, we’re not dependent on Oil exports, we’re not remotely comparable. Think Norway and Denmark.
1463 2018-12-24 20:21:38 Lmao legends ONLY! Who dead ass gets an oil change on Christmas!?
1464 2018-12-24 20:21:38 The price of a barrel of oil is down more than $3 in trading today.  Taking the drop in prices this month and today, gas prices at the pump could drop about forty cents a gallon in the next three weeks - it will be a steady decline.

1466 2018-12-24 20:21:24 The piece I read about oil and gas donors was not exactly truthful. He was omitting the fact saying it was people who work for oil and gas companies who made small individual donations and I read a different article that said he’s worked with Bernie Sanders in the past.

1499 2018-12-24 20:17:17 I'm aware, and I think Sirota conflated the two initially. 

However, since then, news "broke" that some personal donations >$200 came from oil/gas execs. Part of the "No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge" included not accepting those (as well as PAC dollars)

1506 2018-12-24 20:16:48 @StarPlus the cheapest channel ever. promotes only who are only in ur favor and gives oil. @starindia Shame on you.
1507 2018-12-24 20:16:41 What about the Kurds! Russia wants influence in ME, to become dominate influence on OPEC, and use oil to leverage USA via other nations, on every front.

1516 2018-12-24 20:15:26 Merry Christmas for now, getting off for the rest of the day, should be posting my first oil painting later.
1517 2018-12-24 20:15:25 It’s crazy how many people come to get their oil changed on Christmas Eve instead of spending the time with their families.
1518 2018-12-24 20:15:23 I bake all my organic goodies and treats with Cana-coconut oil. Just made a fresh batch of oil last week, just in time for the holidays. Cheers!
1519 2018-12-24 20:15:15 none of this 'not popular, just effective' hogwash changes anything about the gov #ctpolitics that I've maintained as he's nothing but a two-bit manipulating snake oil salesman and now he's someone else's prob.
1520 2018-12-24 20:15:14 RT LoriShemek: Don't Be Afraid of Fat. Healthy fats are excellent for every area of your health - necessary. Long term studies have found a low-fat diet does not help your heart. Add healthy fats such as fatty fish, grass-fed butter, avocado, olive oil, or nuts to every meal…
1521 2018-12-24 20:15:09 one thing i hate about palm oil in food is that if it gets on your clothes it will NEVER come out...
1522 2018-12-24 20:15:08 Gold diggers dig until they find oil.
1523 2018-12-24 20:15:02 Still, though, to be the largest recipient of gas and oil donations?
1524 2018-12-24 20:15:02 Do you care about policies? You reduced people who don't like the attacks against Beto--including David Sirota's manipulative attacks on individual donations from oil and gas industry employees, not specific policy differences--to people who attack Bernie and not worth hearing.
1525 2018-12-24 20:14:49 I’m sorry that you all didn’t get to see my 6yo’s adorable excitement from waking from a nap cherub-cheeked and realizing I’d roasted the leftover potato with olive oil, rosemary, salt and pepper and covered in shredded cheese. She just ran away to try them or I’d have a picture.

1528 2018-12-24 20:14:30 Probably a lot about rage too. Damn tough thing to lose $70K-$100k/yr job. Been there done that. Grateful we were a rabbits run from retirement when the oil price crashed in 2015.
1529 2018-12-24 20:14:16 How do Nigeria intend to over shoot the number of barrels of oil OPEC member counties are expected to produce per day? Heard our 2019 budget is predicated on 2m and above per day. Trust ours is not a voodoo economy
1530 2018-12-24 20:14:14 Bullshit. I don't believe that for a second. Their murderous regime should be ignored and all trade stopped from all over the world. 
Stop them from getting anymore money for oil.
1531 2018-12-24 20:14:06 Kim Dear, you might have Demodex mites. Add some tea tree oil to your cleansers and moisturizers. For your immune system, try using Curcumin or Olive Leaf Extract,  or Oil of Regano. Minimize your stress as much as possible as that plays a huge role in flare up. All the best!
1532 2018-12-24 20:14:06 Best believe your market value is appreciating. You're the oil now
1533 2018-12-24 20:14:01 Howard what would pump prices be today if they had fallen in line with oil?

1538 2018-12-24 20:13:15 There's nothing wrong with the taste of Brussels sprouts, you just have to know how to cook them. Dip them in an oil of your choice and roast them.
1539 2018-12-24 20:13:13 Sonic got through Oil Mine Zone: Act 1.
1540 2018-12-24 20:13:11 Check your oil dipstick. You are probably low. If so you need an oil change!
1541 2018-12-24 20:13:00 Are you aware that in the last quarter century of climate activism since the 1992 Rio Climate Summit, global oil and gas use have shot up between 30% and 70%? And is still climbing?
1542 2018-12-24 20:12:59 #Trump pulls troops out.
  Remaining rebels make war
  War pushes up oil prices

The price of oil makes the #TrumpMob even richer.

• Many Boatmen will give up on their lives by jumping from this bridge. 
• Many fish in river will die after hitting head on the poles while doing swimming in night. 
• Rivers will get polluted by oil and smoke leakage from thousand of vehicles.

1546 2018-12-24 20:12:13 @niceDonaIdTrump Overheard:  Plan was to start another WAR in the
Middle East allocating $1 trillion..That's why you don't get a WALL...
Saudis WAHHABISM fueling Wars worldwide....Their OIL money making
it possible....this fake religion greatest potential threat to region...world
1547 2018-12-24 20:11:58 Then you are delusional.  It is fact of math that you have not been abused.

Your economy grew faster than any in Canada.  Oil industry, that just got about 10 BILLION spent by a Trudeau govt you constantly malign as thanks.

The Rest of Canada has had enough of this whiner act.
1548 2018-12-24 20:11:48 can i get a vegan recipe without damn coconut oil you sickos
1549 2018-12-24 20:11:36 My advice would be :
- learn to tolerate hunger 
- skip breakfast and surf until lunch with delicious black coffee
- eat a HUGE lunch over satiety
- don’t snack 
- eat HUGE diner
-no dessert/sweet/sugar/veg. Oil ->no craving since satiated
- plenty of meat 
- run
1550 2018-12-24 20:11:19 I know how you feel....I haven’t had one in about a year, but they wipe me out. I stated using CDB oil, it has helped a lot.
1551 2018-12-24 20:11:17 Markets are crashing around you.  Stop talking about the fed and Powell.  The banks run the show.  Forget the wall and Focus on increasing oil price.  10% of gdp from energy.  Large bank investment on the line.  Build the spr with the low prices and get supply out of the market.
1552 2018-12-24 20:11:09 I need to practice oil paint
1553 2018-12-24 20:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza today will be: crispy crust with damp coconut oil and cheese.
1554 2018-12-24 20:10:46 @feedme I put myself in him and with all of the letters its my family and alot of jo alot, and he tried to put oil and light me on fire, broke my ribs, and remember.... when you engage, mix... you get in and your battling someone else with your own strength.
1555 2018-12-24 20:10:45 Omg I came in to get an oil change and bought a new car and I’ve been here for a damn work shift 
1556 2018-12-24 20:10:39 The US is the number one producer of oil. The US will soon be the number one Exporter of oil. We no longer care about importing Middle East oil.
1557 2018-12-24 20:10:36 الصبيان والبنات لاحقين عليهم، بعد عشر سنين انشالله ! اهم شي الشطر الأول من الدعوه

1558 2018-12-24 20:10:34 My brown rural empoverished family will defend the very oil companies that just privatized the water shed we live on...the ppl literally poisoning us to death....cuz I have a cousin that makes $17 at said corporation and "they treat him well" 
1559 2018-12-24 20:10:18 たらこって美味いよな！
1560 2018-12-24 20:10:14 The PC party betrayal is about as bad as it gets. I didn’t know that Albertans (the folk who live here) own every drop of oil in the ground. When was the last time you got a royalty cheque? Never? Me too. They sell our property at fire sale rates and don’t even acknowledge it.

1565 2018-12-24 20:09:04 Oil is not real money.  It is a commodity like any other.
1566 2018-12-24 20:09:04 Merry Christmas Chef. Having spaghetti with homemade sauce. Decided to buy fettuccine noodles from Italian store that makes them fresh. Stopped at an Italian Bakery and got sesame seeded bread. Spread butter, garlic oil and garlic powder and baked garlic toast.
1567 2018-12-24 20:08:51 Seems plausible to me that the same underlying demand factors drive the outlook for both oil and inflation. Although I do admit that TIPS pricing can be affected at times by their inferior liquidity to nominal treasuries.

1570 2018-12-24 20:07:55 Some how my oil cap came off my truck 
1571 2018-12-24 20:07:47 @1130gastracker most Langley and Cloverdale gas stations are charging 140.9 cents per litre today, despite oil prices at less than $43 per barrel. That’s up from last night’s price of 129.9 cents.
1572 2018-12-24 20:07:41 Mm I’m in Fort Mac. We’re an oil family. I don’t “hate” anyone. That’s stupid at best.
1573 2018-12-24 20:07:31 I hate getting oil changes cause when I’m driving in I’m scared of falling into that hole in the ground, and when they ask me what oil I want, IDK THE CHEAPER ONE! AND when they tell me my filter is bad but idk nothing about cars so Idk if they’re concerned or finessing me
1574 2018-12-24 20:07:29 $SPX and oil topped about the same time with similar results.
1575 2018-12-24 20:07:02 Exactly. We want based there. Obama probably knew that even when he said he’d end the war. The “war” won’t end as long as we have bases or oil pipelines on their soil.

1578 2018-12-24 20:06:38 Let that sink in... they’ve been tracking the Dow for 122 years. Christmas Eve during World War 1, the Great Depression, World War 2, Cuban Míssil Crisis, Watergate, Oil Crisis, boom and bust cycles for over 100 years, and it’s never fallen this much on this day.
1579 2018-12-24 20:06:25 Why did I just kill a brown recluse in my house....now we can’t breathe for the absurd amounts of peppermint oil I’ve just sprayed everywhere Asthma vs Spiders .....I’m go with asthma
1580 2018-12-24 20:06:25 Please stop trying to get a word from God out of a demonic movie, good fruit and bad fruit does not mix. Oil and water does not mix. You can’t bring God into something demonic and say there’s a word in it like what ...

I know about the training and standards. Just because I don't wish to go fight rich folks wars for oil doesn't mean I don't respect those in the military, but they know what they're signing up for (most of the time).
1583 2018-12-24 20:06:15 The only way we can pay for this.>  If we could make a grand bargain.  Oil and Gas get to move their product,  Canadian govts cut pays for some dental.  But we already know the ecco nutz will have no part of sanity .
1584 2018-12-24 20:06:11 Yup, that's about the size of the mindfulness snake oil...I can bet there's a bunch of traders and shareholders not ready for snake oil yet after day:)  Wall Street Mindfulness, now if that doesn't make your sides hurt:)
1585 2018-12-24 20:05:46 It is the Beverly HIgh swim gym. A WPA project. The oil well is being removed.
1586 2018-12-24 20:05:28 We should push for a #carbontax on oil and gas producers in Alaska.

With that carbon tax comes a tax deduction for every dollar they spend converting to renewables. We need a gigafactory in Alaska.

Big energy has the money to do it if we incentivize it. #akleg
1587 2018-12-24 20:05:26 #Saudi have to stop $oil export for a week just to show that they are serious. Market don't trust on #OPEC any more.
1588 2018-12-24 20:05:23 What’s better than showering and then slathering your body in coconut oil?
1589 2018-12-24 20:05:18 PSA: if you flip your cartridges upside down and the oil moves more easily or like a juice it is FAKE/non distillate. 
1590 2018-12-24 20:04:56 Head mechanics tell the noobs to put on the oil filters lightly or "finger tight" so they don't seize on without actually showing them how tight that is. Then they vibrate off pretty quick, unless someone is spotting the engine often ends up dead. Just people being lazy really
1591 2018-12-24 20:04:54 My sister let me use coconut oil and makeup things so I look human enough for our family photo so she's the real mvp this year
1592 2018-12-24 20:04:51 How long will a barrel of oil keep?   Asking for a friend.
1593 2018-12-24 20:04:48 I use cbd oil for my anxiety and I can honestly say it makes a huge difference for me! My mom also uses it for her side effects from her chemotherapy and for her anxiety, seriously amazing! I highly recommend!

1595 2018-12-24 20:04:39 Wear your hot oil scars with pride dear 
1596 2018-12-24 20:04:38 Oh that again. You really think being #1 in oil and gas donations had nothing to do with his support for offshore drilling or not being on the progressive caucus that is pushing for legislation to combat climate change? Very naive.
1597 2018-12-24 20:04:32 One of my fav things to do is give a big tip to someone making close to min wage having to work Xmas eve. 2 young girls today at the oil change place got the surprise.The looks on their face is what it’s all about, try it sometime...it’s awesome.

Merry Christmas everyone!!
1598 2018-12-24 20:04:25 Kinda wanna do the oil change for my car by myself  sounds fun
1599 2018-12-24 20:04:05 Cooking oil! I shit you not....
1600 2018-12-24 20:04:01 The failure of @realDonaldTrump is he thinks tweets can fix everything he has done wrong. His tweets allowed him to pump the snake oil that got him elected, but now as he twists and turns with his tweets it has only allowed the venom of his mistakes to further inhibit him.
1601 2018-12-24 20:03:58 You want extras you gotta catch the oil with the water
1602 2018-12-24 20:03:44 Really interesting that it’s useful for modelling drug delivery. The explanation came from oil industry applications
1603 2018-12-24 20:03:41 I had two failed engagements and it was awesome Shortcut: cheap ass can biscuits, cooking oil, powdered sugar.
1604 2018-12-24 20:03:38 Yes, Hard mode limit changes to 6 a day, but it is a de facto improvement with the same benefits because you spend less oil doing 3 over 6.
Eventually, if you raise the danger level to max, it'll just spawn the boss ship only for that node.
1605 2018-12-24 20:03:35 OIL -6%
1606 2018-12-24 20:03:27 What's wrong with oil & gas?  Without that form of energy humankind would perish. 

And FYI:

- France 264MW
- California 614MW
- Texas 810MW

Follow the Texas model established by state Republicans if you want to go green.
1607 2018-12-24 20:03:15 lmao forgot to add if you flip it upside down and the oil moves easily it is fake.

So, want to explain to me again how I’m incorrect in my assertion that small amounts are the only allowable donations from fossil fuel reps according to the pledge?
1611 2018-12-24 20:02:51 Any honest nat would’ve breathed a sigh of relief at the oil crash. Not these flag-waving pseudo-IRA wannabes though.
1612 2018-12-24 20:02:32 Sana oil.
1613 2018-12-24 20:02:24 The U.S. has shale oil in the country,
Confident that Russia, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and Iran can be enemies.

1615 2018-12-24 20:02:23 There is no oil. Because then 5000 km is not a problem for you.
1616 2018-12-24 20:02:14 Exact!  BTW seeing oil going down was wondering if you still old your April call on USO?  Me still in...and wondering if I am adding.

1619 2018-12-24 20:01:26 U don't get it. Fed raised 8 x 25bps = up by 2%. Nothing to freak out over. Works economies are cooling which lowers energy demand. Excess oil supply also depresses oil pressures $. US crude was @ 52wk high in Oct. Trump yapping #TariffsRDumb & #TradeWarsRStupid main culprit.
1620 2018-12-24 20:01:14 I supported Beto cause Cruz is like the worst combo of creeper, oil tycoon, and guy who shoots and skins rats. But I think Beto doesn’t have as good a voting record as Sanders.
1621 2018-12-24 20:01:10 Who knew this whole time instead of waiting for puberty to give me facial hair I should’ve just been using Jamaican castor oil.
1622 2018-12-24 20:00:52 It would be quite difficult for the DPRK to pay that much US Dollar though, because they need the money for oil and parts for the big bomb. Maybe DPRK currency instead? This can be negotiated between President Trump and the Glorious Leader Kim Jong-Un.
1623 2018-12-24 20:00:51 No hits to the head, got it. And enochian chains... Or is it Holy oil??

1634 2018-12-24 19:59:56 Having yam and palm oil pepper sauce for dinner and I’m excitedddddd
1635 2018-12-24 19:59:52 If the chicken enter oil and the oil goes sharaaaaaaaa, yes that's the time I wee appear in my full glory to support you in your endeavor but you see the process of killing washing and boiling, don't even dream it,  you wont see my hair
1636 2018-12-24 19:59:47 My eldest nephew asks... “if oil of made from dinosaur fossils, and plastic is made from oil, does that mean that a plastic toy dinosaur is a real dinosaur?”
1637 2018-12-24 19:59:46 Beto does not stand for my values like taking money from big oil. I don’t feel he’s a threat to Bernie
1638 2018-12-24 19:59:35 Who the fuck cares if they announce a presidential bid?  They're already in office and they're already doing harm.  They're not immune for the shit things they're already doing to us just because they aren't running for a different office.  Beto LOVES wall street and big oil. 
1639 2018-12-24 19:59:14 — candles, before finding the scent she wanted. Vanilla. Fawn had this essential oil she used to wear when she was younger, and it smelled like Vanilla. Fawn smiled at the memories.

1643 2018-12-24 19:58:36 I hooked up with a guy once at somebody else’s house and he suggested getting olive oil from the kitchen and I was like umm no thanks...
1644 2018-12-24 19:58:34 Pretty sure we were holding $1.8bn of Iran’s money, and without the needed banking structure to return it via wire, so yes, we returned their money to them in cash...you’re just another dope who thinks we ought to be in there taking their oil.
1645 2018-12-24 19:58:29 World economy going in recession
U.S. crude oil plunges 6.7% to $42.53/bbl,

1646 2018-12-24 19:58:26 How often are you supposed to get your oil changed? 
1647 2018-12-24 19:58:16 Take a couple shots of castor oil, it’ll clean you out before you go into labor too.  My cousin did it with both her kids & it kicked her into labor both times! 
1648 2018-12-24 19:57:53 It's perfectly reasonable. No oil pack money & no individual contributions over $200. It's fine.
1649 2018-12-24 19:57:35 You check them in, you check them out.

If they havent been checked off by their leave date, they go on a list to be detained.

1651 2018-12-24 19:57:00 Axe oil? Rub it on your neck, sometimes migraines are result of strain of your neck

Ooooh hmm, besides laying down, you should drink some honey and warm water then gently take clumps of your hair near the roots and tug it firmly at the affected area

1655 2018-12-24 19:56:09 Each and every one of these guys would be hate-tweeting about FDR, LBJ and JFK every waking moment. They'd never stop talking about how FDR refused to punish Texaco for selling oil to Franco, or JFK's ties to McCarthy, or LBJ's conservative past.
1656 2018-12-24 19:56:00 Saying Beto took fossil fuel money from oil execs is not a bad faith argument for example. Just so everyone is on the same page.
1657 2018-12-24 19:55:54 Mr P delighted with his star, thank you. Courgettes are sliced and sautéed in butter and a dash of olive oil. Family tradition on my side, don’t knock them ‘til you’ve tried them x

1660 2018-12-24 19:55:42 turns police into a protected class, making assaulting an officer akin to a hate crime. He voted for a Republican bill that would weaken lending disclosure protections for home mortgage borrowers. He voted for Republican bills to lift the 40-year-old oil export ban (twice).

1663 2018-12-24 19:55:16 instead of saying "beholding to big oil" 

lets just point out that beto is not backing the #GreenNewDeal or even trying to #banfracking

it's easier and gets issues in the minds of the voters.

this may be shaun's point, but i don't want to speak for him.
1664 2018-12-24 19:55:13 Putin probably not overly happy at the drop in oil prices.  But  he will take the larger win.
1665 2018-12-24 19:55:11 Oil will rise .. Turkish lira will fall .. Soon

Petrol yükselecek .. Türk Lirası düşecek .. Yakında

النفط سيرتفع .. والليرة التركية ستهبط .. قريباً
1666 2018-12-24 19:55:08 The entire planet lost in 2016.
What's your point?

My point is this:
VET BEFORE YOU VOTE.

Beto votes against the environment, takes Big Oil donations & sides with Israel against Palestine.

You can have him.

I'll vote for the most progressive candidate running.

1667 2018-12-24 19:55:07 Give CBD oil salve a try. I have a friend whose daughter has been fighting this (she’s 4 years old). They started using CBD oil salve and it had made a tremendous difference.
1668 2018-12-24 19:55:04 W/out being sentimental, I believe the concern is abt the depletion of our savings. No one is sure the direction of oil in 2019. What will be our buffer in case oil price crashes again. I'm worried too. The FG is doing this to ensure the states are fine but we must think tomorrow
1669 2018-12-24 19:54:57 Chaos? Years ago someone like Dimon, Buffett or Bloomberg would step up & calm the markets.There are deflationary trends! US cheap abundant oil & NG always push back inflation. Yet Fed raising rates?Trade a factor? Yes! But not sole issue! Gov pls stop fighting! Please Compromise
1670 2018-12-24 19:54:50 Well cheap oil isn't bad, but an economic downturn is bad.
1671 2018-12-24 19:54:50 Port Harcourt, Nigeria. Such a great place where most Nigerians love to visit due to the vast oil& gas production coupled with many other business opportunities available here. However, we are battling with security issues here, yea, very seriously we do.
1672 2018-12-24 19:54:34 Let's be blunt, you're just whining.  Beto is just so much DNC swooning over some boy band celebrity.  Nobody's afraid of him - but if the progressives point out he takes oil money, Beto got some 'Splaining to Do.
1673 2018-12-24 19:54:31 During Iran's first sanctions by all. saudi deliberately kept the price of oil down to inflict more damage to Iran's economey. now is pay back time.
1674 2018-12-24 19:54:02 So they get that oil money huh? What do we get? How much is your cut? Trump Tower Damascus?
1675 2018-12-24 19:53:59 I don’t like Beto because he’s not a progressive at all. What are Betos policies that are “progressive”? Why doesn’t he support Medicare for all? Why not the Green New Deal? We’re staring down the barrel of a gun with climate collapse and Betos main benefactors are oil companies.
1676 2018-12-24 19:53:57 My diversified portfolio of #oil and #bitcoin feels good today.

1678 2018-12-24 19:53:36 It’s always been. I mean, we have a giant port and numerous refineries. It’s basically an oil town with tourism thanks to the coast.

1680 2018-12-24 19:52:56 If you do cook bacon again, the leftover fat makes a great cooking oil for whatever you make after.
1681 2018-12-24 19:52:41 Yes. I am. I truly am special. Just as you are. I have apologized repeatedly. If Workman’s Comp isn’t taking care of your case, take all of your documentation to your state’s Labor Secretary. Don’t take no for an answer. It’s true that the squeaky wheel gets the oil. Notify media
1682 2018-12-24 19:52:32 I definitely want to see if CBD oil would help with migraine relief.
1683 2018-12-24 19:52:29 Cannibis Coconut oil in Vegan Pasta with veggies is my new fav way to have the oil.

1688 2018-12-24 19:51:34 I made paleo pancakes and now I think my blood is 20% pure coconut oil.
1689 2018-12-24 19:51:28 Instead of boiling, try it in a tiny bit of olive oil on a low heat for 20mins sweating. Delicious.
1690 2018-12-24 19:51:23 《オリーブ油豆知識》
オリーブ油は オレイン酸が腸の刺激を促してくれるため、便秘解消効果がある
1691 2018-12-24 19:51:07 I have no illusions about immediately fixing the environment, I have hope for providing leadership. Our province is gaining a horrid reputation for oil bullying, we need to embrace some alternatives to offset this. There is such thing as social license, though it’s lost on UCP.
1692 2018-12-24 19:51:06 I’m in Walmart & I ask the worker where the tea tree oil at she gone say “what is that” 
1693 2018-12-24 19:51:02 I love this so much... The juxtaposition of old & new, the old medium of oil & the new concept of a selfie works so well. Breathtakingly good.

1696 2018-12-24 19:50:26 And they didn’t even include the oil baron career day
1697 2018-12-24 19:50:25 Beto's better than Texas Republicans, so he should run for Senate again. 
But, he supports US tax dollars going to Israel for military support, so I'm cool off him for president. And he lied about not taking oil money.
1698 2018-12-24 19:50:24 They need to take some olive oil to the slides at McDonalds, they are too slow.
Those kids deserve to feel like they are being shot out of a fucking cannon.
1699 2018-12-24 19:50:23 In a shortened Christmas Eve session, #oil plunges more than 6% today. WTI crude falls to $42.68 a barrel, and Brent drops to $50.47 a barrel. #OOTT
1700 2018-12-24 19:50:23 I’m careful about what I put on my scalp, I realize my flair ups are more in the summer, vs the winter, I normally just use castor oil...and I’m careful about my bread in take cuz seborrehic dermatitis is a yeast overgrowth

1706 2018-12-24 19:49:48 Body oil is for juice heads
1707 2018-12-24 19:49:27 Beto = taken money from oil & big business. Voted with republicans numerous times. 

I can just fling “Beto is being pushed by the DNC” and hope it sticks but if I did do that I’d actually stand a better chance of being factual.
1708 2018-12-24 19:49:23 Potpourri and tea tree oil

1715 2018-12-24 19:48:54 I thought low oil prices act as a tax cut

1720 2018-12-24 19:48:09 I think its a mix of tea tree oil and their natural scent

1724 2018-12-24 19:47:39 Day 11 of feeling good. It's so weird. Hope it lasts. I wonder if the CBD oil I started taking is helping or if its just coincidence....... Either way, I ain't complaining

1729 2018-12-24 19:46:42 What do they have to say about the bloodier protests in Congo, South Cameroon (Ambazonia)? And does AU have any statements concerning burgeoning protests in France and Belgium? Or does EU only sympathize with oil rich countries
1730 2018-12-24 19:46:06 Tax cuts. Farm bill. Out of Paris Agreement and TPP. NAFTA replaced. Net Neutrality gone. Hundreds of regulations gone. Booming economy and jobs. World leader in oil production. Koreas heading to peace/denuke. Justice reform.....
1731 2018-12-24 19:46:03 Do they have a physical presence in Syria, not sure how the Ruskies or Iranians will react to the Saudis meddling overtly. Good thing is when sand melts it turns into glass so be able to find the oil easier in Saudi Arabia.

1743 2018-12-24 19:43:53 The meditation diet sounds like a great diet. Although I would substitute the olive oil with coconut oil. And I agree salt intake is bad because the salt that's usually used is table salt. I would substitute it with sea salt.
1744 2018-12-24 19:43:50 @jimcramer @WarrenBuffett wow I just saw a brutal SELL OFF today. Tough market conditions and a lot of Volatility. & Oil n the 40s, yeah some body did call that a month r so ago. Alogs, Vol, & Panic. A bit bumpy today. Well have a good XMAS after today some Jack Daniels.
1745 2018-12-24 19:43:48 Again, Bush 43 made his oil friends rich raising the prices of oil and gasoline. Now this one is making his CEO/Business buddies rich with tax cuts and short selling stock. In my opinion.

1757 2018-12-24 19:42:58 Penser au pétrole du lac Albert dont le bassin versant est incliné vers l'Uganda dont les investissements dans le secteur et même l'évacuation de crude oil par pipe line vers Tanzanie est encours, le seul cobalt ne constituerait  pas une panacée pour le DRC.
1758 2018-12-24 19:42:55 Onions and celery frying in olive oil is the best home air freshener scent. Fight me.
1759 2018-12-24 19:42:52 Wild hair growth is good and Jamaican castor oil that’s what made my hair grow fast asf
1760 2018-12-24 19:42:50 Any kind of Iran war would get oil prices back up for the fossil-fuel oligarchs who installed Trump.
1761 2018-12-24 19:42:28 All of those are energy companies, state owned or private oil, coal and gas. They're doing what corporate entities do, facilitate for money. The polluters are ultimately the consumers, the governments who don't facilitate change and the companies who make high polluting products.
1762 2018-12-24 19:42:23 Merry Christmas to you too. The most powerful and wise reindeers in The world of creepy economics. Fuck you Santa, there is no more oil and shit coins to discover. 
1763 2018-12-24 19:42:17 They putt tree oil in eggnog yet #AskingForAllMyFriends
1764 2018-12-24 19:41:35 They call me young olive oil cause i be on that extra virgin shit
1765 2018-12-24 19:41:23 Getting my oil changed at Uncle Ed's was the most excitement I've had in weeks
1766 2018-12-24 19:41:20 Lefties say we shouldn't subsidize big oil. I agree. We also shouldn't subsidize big farming, big Pharma, solar, wind, etc., etc. Why does big gov't get to choose who gets what in regard to subsidies for corporate America. Cut them all off.
1767 2018-12-24 19:41:15 PHC na oil money we de spend 
1768 2018-12-24 19:41:07 I need to remember to get myself some Mason jars or smth to discard of fats and oil from cooking
1769 2018-12-24 19:40:50 In theory. But oil has not been a true commodity market for decades. In the real world is a manipulated two tier market of a financial oil layer floating on the physical oil layer. China is not buying all the oil on offer. It's that simple. Nothing whatever to do with USD/CNY
1770 2018-12-24 19:40:31 Oh yeah. And canned tuna, must be soaked in oil tho’, not that water stuff.
1771 2018-12-24 19:40:31 That why they lobby not to be sent to the north,they see the east as their oil well,waste land with warrant chief's
1772 2018-12-24 19:40:31 Translation: big oil is the future. Progressives are old news.

If you want a president that cozies up to big oil, vote for Beto.
1773 2018-12-24 19:40:29 He comes in with experience producing a post-apocalyptic oil dictatorship, so you could say he's right for the job.
1774 2018-12-24 19:40:27 この前炎龍堂に寄ったらテオさんがお茶出してくれて美味かったぜ～なんかモミアゲ長いねーちゃんがちょっと睨んでたけど(笑)
1775 2018-12-24 19:40:24 It’s called Prevention, not surgical intervention. #Fluoridation works. Would you not prevent engine failure by not investing in preventive maintenance oil changes? Or would you let the engine break down and then pay thousands of dollars to fix it? Same same.
1776 2018-12-24 19:40:23 Here, sitting at work, waiting for my delivery of cannibas oil cartridges while there's thousands of people still in prison for buying/selling weed. This country is fucking weird
1777 2018-12-24 19:40:22 Slightly tasteless water with a lot of oil in it with prices of overcooked meat and hominy
1778 2018-12-24 19:40:10 try coating with olive oil and baking a few. they make tots obsolete
1779 2018-12-24 19:40:07 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
1780 2018-12-24 19:40:07 People buy oil because it's an amazing product and people produce it because people buy it.
1781 2018-12-24 19:40:02 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
1782 2018-12-24 19:39:59 "For now, there's no place to hide in any of these markets. Oil's being taken down with the stock market and the negative sentiment that's sweeping across really everything, and for now the downward pressure is going to persist," John Kilduff
1783 2018-12-24 19:39:58 @LukeGromen @VictorCleaner Gold/oil ratio is soaring! Who is this good for ?!
1784 2018-12-24 19:39:48 has he annointed anyone with queen victorias coronation oil? 
wonder if it was himself and he got a bit confused?
1785 2018-12-24 19:39:31 Never. It's a myth. Oil and butter basted ever 15 mins
1786 2018-12-24 19:39:24 Please let me know how it goes, just don't add too much oil, the meat usually has it's own oil even if it's chicken. Love u too 
1787 2018-12-24 19:39:22 True but exiting without ensuring support for countries we’ve invaded for oil is compounding our mistakes.
1788 2018-12-24 19:39:16 I love brussel sprouts! Cut in half drizzle olive oil over, spice to taste and put in the oven. So delicious. I just made myself hungry for some, lol
1789 2018-12-24 19:39:10 I used a couple of tablespoons of grapeseed oil, tablespoon of honey and some salt.
1790 2018-12-24 19:39:10 I wont be voting for a candidate bought and paid for by big Oil.

That pretty much cuts out Beto
1791 2018-12-24 19:38:51 This Donald Dump is fully responsible for the economy and the recent stock fall. When oil is $60 +, he yells all the time to lower the oil price. He creates trade wars and said this will make America Great. Now the market drops do much. We don't have a Merry Christmas
1792 2018-12-24 19:38:47 #Energy: Oil plunges 6.2-6.7%, #Brent settles at $50.47, #WTI at $42.53. @ReutersUK

1795 2018-12-24 19:38:27 Because of my recent corn-holing by the energy markets and $XLE in particular, I have recently added (Oil Baggy) to my name. It will remain so until $XLE trades back above 59.97, or the dividends accumulate above. I will make no further adds to my position. 
1796 2018-12-24 19:38:23 Not enough oil there for the US to be arsed about I guess
1797 2018-12-24 19:38:21 Corporate debt from mid-sized/regional banks in the Permian are about to bust.  Watch oil
1798 2018-12-24 19:38:18 Use bio oil it works really good
1799 2018-12-24 19:38:15 I said hot oil spilled on my hand while frying chicken,people are more concerned about the chicken you are all mad!!!
1800 2018-12-24 19:38:13 That's brilliant James. You can slice up the more tender top bit of the stalk and roast the pieces (in butter or oil) and use as a vegetable and /or make this the basis of a soup!
1801 2018-12-24 19:38:00 I don't think that is wise for him to do. Rather, he should work to see the league issue is solved, FA glamour restored, Falcons taken care of etc.. "Truth is like oil, no amount of water pure on it, it will Always float"
1802 2018-12-24 19:37:59 Can always count on npr to diss de-escalation of oil sucking military action.

1804 2018-12-24 19:37:35 A mother can never be replaced!!! Last night the soles of my feet were hurting & I kept complaining, very early this morning I woke to my mother massaging my feet with holy oil/black stone healing ointment! She’s doing it again this evening.....#gratefulheart
1805 2018-12-24 19:37:29 The price of gold in real money (oil) has risen 85% quarter-to-date in 4q18.
1806 2018-12-24 19:37:13 are you changing your argument now? because i thought your beef with sirota was that he misrepresented employees of the oil industry, which he did not

1808 2018-12-24 19:37:09 Have you tried Neem oil Kim? OOOOO I hope you get better. I have never had that condition but when researching other issues I came across Neem as a good resource. Others include Vitamin A, E and Zinc.
1809 2018-12-24 19:37:08 Just popped to the petrol station for last minute bits and pieces. They had olive oil but they didn’t have icing sugar, darts or ping pong balls.
1810 2018-12-24 19:36:55 Again, same as everyone and guaranteed #ScheerIgnorance wanting pipelines and invest in oil will only make it worst.
1811 2018-12-24 19:36:55 On May 29, June 1 and Oct 12 you called it a scam and now you're back to "any second"? What's up oil dude?
1812 2018-12-24 19:36:51 @CNN Hmmm ... Perhaps, if US stopped intruding into affairs of other SOVEREIGN  nations & dictating how they should conduct themselves we wouldn't have to be PARANOID/HYSTERICAL about "defending ourselves" by destroying those nations! Blowing-up Mid East is about OIL and POPPIES.
1813 2018-12-24 19:36:15 christmas time is when young men go home and talk to every relative and childhood friend about how they grew a beard.

1819 2018-12-24 19:35:29 Nitpicking goes that way right? How does that feel? Issues are complex. Bernie has way more to worry about than Beto oil money. So stop nitpicking & worry about Sander’s flawed record. Hillary is not running & Beto hasn’t declared. Sanders supporters attacks on Beto r pathetic.
1820 2018-12-24 19:35:23 NOOOOOO, we're headed to West Texas where the majority of family and friends own, or are in the OIL business

1823 2018-12-24 19:35:12 My mom has had psoriasis for close to 55 years.   She started emu oil and emu oil tablets and it has been disappeared.   Her doctors are amazed   Montana emu ranch is where she orders all her products from.  Good luck
1824 2018-12-24 19:35:11 Yeah, a man with deep ties to oil and gas who refuses to join the Progressive Caucus and who has voted with Republicans pretty consistently over the last two years is what we need more of instead of literally anyone else.
1825 2018-12-24 19:35:09 Not to mention empowering and enriching cartels. Smuggling people is prob more profitable than drugs. No investment in product and if they are caught, no loss.
Either way, they've been paid.
1826 2018-12-24 19:34:55 A little matter how many of his donations we're above 1000? While all of those weren't oil and gas I give you that there was more than 14,000 +/- that gave that amount equaling more than 30.9 million
1827 2018-12-24 19:34:52 Fuck oil changes

1836 2018-12-24 19:33:59 @popchips I purchased a bag of your new "yes peas" and saw on front of the bag "whole peas, a hint of oil & seasoning." For starters, it has 3 milk products that aren't mentioned on the front of the packet. False advertising irritates the shit out of me. You've lost a customer.
1837 2018-12-24 19:33:58 Meanwhile @realDonaldTrump spending like a fool with an upside down balance sheet. Unfortunately, a country can’t file Chapter 11, so we’ll have to sell pieces of our country. Not bonds, mind you (no one will buy those). Hard assets like timber rights, oil rights, water rights.
1838 2018-12-24 19:33:57 If you go back before the oil was discovered. That region was the most peaceful and the era was known for good governance. You don’t know history man, I think you watch n believe Hollywood a lot.
1839 2018-12-24 19:33:54 Is there anything that Saudi Arabia can do to quickly stabilize oil prices? Today oil prices went down another 6%! This down draft needs to reverse in order for the broader markets to recover.
1840 2018-12-24 19:33:52 Apparently, markets didn't do the job (excepts for a very few part - saying 1% - of us). No reason they will in the future. Making money with palm oil while destroying primary forest ? Markets don't care !

1843 2018-12-24 19:33:47 Oy. 

I wasn't arguing the "lose the pledge" point, just pointing out in passing it wasn't English. I am a big fan of Oil Change.

That said, I don't know of evidence he ever mentioned them or their pledge. It's not even clear he signed when the org put him on their list.
1844 2018-12-24 19:33:45 Maybe she’d be happier in a place like Texas City, TX where the air smells like oil. She’d fit in great there.
1845 2018-12-24 19:33:34 Can they align my tires and change the oil in the car if I’m asleep in the backseat? 
1846 2018-12-24 19:33:31 Hemp bomb vape oil
1847 2018-12-24 19:33:26 Because it takes money to win. Also a lot of those were individual donations from people who work in the oil and gas industry. That is a big employer in Texas.
1848 2018-12-24 19:33:26 This beard oil is not it fam, got my facial smelling like an old bar of soap in a retirement home.
1849 2018-12-24 19:33:26 Oya go and buy oil na.
1850 2018-12-24 19:33:23 As with last time oil dropped to these levels, base decline and maintenance capex (capex needed to keep production flat) will be focus. Those with largest organic growth rates will likely be ones with highest decline/maintenance capex. Budgets should be lowered to maint. level.
1851 2018-12-24 19:33:04 do you dislike a lot of art supplies or is oil paint your main rival?
1852 2018-12-24 19:32:59 I'm from ND. Its racist AF in Williston area, that's the Bakken, where all the oil production is. They are all trump loving hill billies in that area.

1856 2018-12-24 19:32:48 Matt and Tucker are the epitome of aggrieved white men. They are both wealthy and privileged, yet cry about how our culture is so unfair to them and all other white men. In reality, they’re con men selling snake oil to less privleged white men who feel that society owes them.
1857 2018-12-24 19:32:33 How is putting an oil industry candidate in office for 8 of the 12 years we have to address the climate crisis a viable path forward? Let's have an honest conversation about policy before anointing anyone.
1858 2018-12-24 19:32:20 Wait waiittt darkskin men be letting girls call them “Tar baby” and “oil spill”?!!! What is wrong with y’all. Those words are not fkn compliments
1859 2018-12-24 19:32:17 Shell co's were making 4% return on capital when oil was $60. No drilling and no capex at $40 and below, then natural decline hits
1860 2018-12-24 19:32:01 Body oil vs lotion ??
1861 2018-12-24 19:31:59 SAME because of oil is damaging by cloud and clouds are raining 
1862 2018-12-24 19:31:58 Too bad for Venezuela that they are now a petro competitor, and that it helps US economy & geopolitical interests for Venezuela oil to be offline. Otherwise, we would have invaded & deposed Chavez/Maduro a few years ago. Would be nice to get a look at their intel agency's files.

1867 2018-12-24 19:30:53 Why is it so important for #nmleg to raise hundreds of millions in new revenue? Cause oil was down over 6% today and is down about 40% in 2 months. We can’t rely on oil to build a #StrongerNM
1868 2018-12-24 19:30:52 WTI #Oil melts down in the final hrs of trading, settling down 6.3% at $42.70/bbl. Domestic inventories are within 5 MMbbls of yr-ago levels but prices are now down 29%. This sell-off is overdone. Those with the funds and the courage to buy here will likely be rewarded long-term.
1869 2018-12-24 19:30:50 It's next to the oil well.
1870 2018-12-24 19:30:50 BTW, you do not shut down the govt and let go of key cabinet members the same week the Fed increases rates.  Also, cheap oil lowers the stock market.  Just saying.
1871 2018-12-24 19:30:45 Venezuela has been bled dry by US for many years,buying oil at dirt cheap cost ,I spent time there it was heartbreaking ,the poverty was bad ppl were lovely,there were two revolutions in quick succession,helped by US....mind you in US 27 millions live in poverty.

1883 2018-12-24 19:29:02 In a commodity market, the marginal barrel prices the whole.

1886 2018-12-24 19:28:41 In the last 24 hrs there were a total of 5 oil product tankers in the ports of Quebec City and Montreal. Yet according to Quebec Premier François Legault, there is no social acceptability for oil in Quebec.

1887 2018-12-24 19:28:38 It sucks. Put some castor oil on a few times a day.  It softens and it lasts a long time.  It also helps to tan.  It's the best you can do.  I've tried everything else...
1888 2018-12-24 19:28:28 I understand rates have been held low. The markets and the elite are addicted to cheap money. The Fed has raised 9 times now. So, do you keep going at that pace? Oil hit an 18 month low today. That is as big of a signal of deflation as you will get. Listen to what the markets say

1891 2018-12-24 19:27:59 I’m truly confused with this app. 
Like I can’t believe we all gonna pretend dark dudes didn’t get roasted everyday during high school?
Like I can’t be the only kid who remember the oil spill and midnight jokes right?

1896 2018-12-24 19:27:18 The only thing saving us is the decline in oil. Imagine what wouldve happened if inflation was on the table $spx $uso $es $spy $qqq $nq $dia

1898 2018-12-24 19:27:08 Buhari reformed agriculture but local rice is still #21,000. 

He reformed oil industry but fuel is #147 and we still pay subsidy.

He fought corruption but ganduje, babachir and akpabio are eating with him.

1903 2018-12-24 19:26:58 I’m a Jehovah witness can you have someone come in tomorrow for me

No we have family’s we are spending the day with No one is going to come in and do a oil change for you

I’m suing you guys this is discrimination

Okay my name is Breiana you can use my name when you call BMWUSA
1904 2018-12-24 19:26:54 Yes, a perfectly logical argument about how snake oil salesmen work is stupid. 

The devotion to party over people is why we will lose again in 2020.
1905 2018-12-24 19:26:47 Girl I freaking feel you on that. It was $100.50 for my oil change last month

1907 2018-12-24 19:26:32 A tiny amount of oil paint and lots of white spirit. I gloss varnished the model and then applied my wash and it just runs into all the crevices like magic. Once the wash sets (tomorrow) I can take a cotton swab and more white spirit and remove wash from anywhere I don't want it

1909 2018-12-24 19:26:06 Aggregated donations from oil employees were low compared to other lines of work. People contributed more who worked in the following: human rights, civil servants, healthcare professionals, education, non-profits, music, entertainment, publishing/printing, tech., law, retirees.

1911 2018-12-24 19:25:55 Israël is acting like a fascist apartheid state illegaly occupying the Golan Heights with ambitions of annexing it & grabing its water, oil, & other natural resources
Israël is pulling us all on a path towards nuclear war
Syria belongs to syrians !
1912 2018-12-24 19:25:54 I’ll point out there was also an Arab oil embargo around that time. Nevertheless, removal of President is bad for markets, and markets are now reflecting that as a possibility
1913 2018-12-24 19:25:53 For some, it's coconut oil 
1914 2018-12-24 19:25:47 His big oil policies and votes are consistent, and show opposition to immediately reversing climate change.
1915 2018-12-24 19:25:44 What happened to the use of oil

1916 2018-12-24 19:25:36 If you can stand the taste try a cap full of apple cider vinegar (Braggs with the "Mother"), a quarter tsp of tumeric, a tsp of coconut oil mixed with warm water. Drink that about half hour before breakfast. It works great on the pain..I didn't like the taste. A squeeze of lemon
1917 2018-12-24 19:25:32 They most likely dont lol. But you could ask any restaurant dor an oz of oil and thatll work
1918 2018-12-24 19:25:31 I always forget that some guys are cut so tight they need lube to jerk off. One time a friend and I were hanging out jerking and I didn't have any lube since I'm uncut but he was, so he got stuck using olive oil lol! I bought some lube shortly after for tightly circumcised guests
1919 2018-12-24 19:25:30 And we should start talking about this... At what price will oil start creating a banking crisis?

1922 2018-12-24 19:25:15 Love the overly simplified way you look at the world. Syria is Ba'athist, and with SA and Russian money export cheap oil. Importantly, SA will also buy lots of Russian/US/UK weapons too. This will only deepen the Middle East Crisis. Loss to Kurdish and modernist Muslims.

1925 2018-12-24 19:24:49 David’s obsession with Beto seems a little weird, especially since he hasn’t even declared that he’s running for president.

Also, his attempt to correlate oil and gas donations from *individuals* as the same as PAC money is strange. 

Just wondering why this is such a pet issue.
1926 2018-12-24 19:24:43 Now we get it. Throw around enough money and oil and you get to butcher as many American permanent residents as you want.
1927 2018-12-24 19:24:42 Nuln oil, perhaps? I too am curious, now.
1928 2018-12-24 19:24:21 That wall will never happen. Trump sold you snake oil and you’re still waiting to drink it
1929 2018-12-24 19:24:17 Why aren't Sperm Whales called Oil Whales?
1930 2018-12-24 19:24:15 How much oil did Nigeria sell and at what price to realize 7T?
The fact you bifurcated FIRS remittances from NPA's shows clearly you have no clue what you are talking about. You musn't tell the world you struggled with elementary mathematics.
1931 2018-12-24 19:24:12 Gold is dark or white? Bacardi makes good white rum and their dark rum is worse than what I imagine crude oil would be
1932 2018-12-24 19:23:56 Americans are fascinated with being on trend.  The popularity of pomegranates, avocados, açai,  quinoa, and coconut oil are proof. So why not cauliflower?

1936 2018-12-24 19:23:41 @Nick2oon saw an interview with your Dad many years ago and he was talking about how concussions had put him in bad shape... was listening to Joe Rogan podcast where they were speaking of someone that was in bad shape due to concussions and came out of it with CBD oil...
1937 2018-12-24 19:23:32 The point would be to put up a progressive candidate who will select liberal justices while also prioritizing climate change mitigation over big oil.
1938 2018-12-24 19:23:29 Making pozole.  Following some fancy recipe instructing me to wash the hominy, season and oil it and toast in the oven.  Realize these are corn nuts. I'm making corn nuts.

1942 2018-12-24 19:23:00 Yes, oil tends to be in bizarre places. 
1943 2018-12-24 19:22:57 Truck drivers are in the first boat of replacements for AI drivers and the government has done nothing to change that fact. Sucks even worse for you because big business and oil lobbyists won’t fight for you either because of how much profit is in getting rid of you! Wake up!!
1944 2018-12-24 19:22:54 When comes to treatments - especially the medicinal kind - I'm all about options. I don't know why people think only ONE kind of medicine has to work and if you try this essential oil combo then you're a KOOK or some shit like that.
1945 2018-12-24 19:22:48 I highly recommend CBD oil from CBD brothers online, best stuff for pain relief, arthritis and a lot of other stuff
1946 2018-12-24 19:22:48 My aunt told me that mayonnaise was made from oil and I imagined it as crude oil and actively avoided mayo on everything.
1947 2018-12-24 19:22:41 This hit piece glosses over real political differences between Sanders and what the author terms “blah blah” candidates. 1) People want candidates who are not beholden to monied interests (financial sector, health insurers, oil&gas, etc); 1/

1950 2018-12-24 19:22:06 Mix well till you see the oil becomes thick.

Add your local spices (ehuru, mpuru uziza), pepper, crayfish, seasoning cubes. Stir well.

Add your cooked cow leg inside and stir very well.
1951 2018-12-24 19:22:05 apparently my car uses synthetic oil whatever the heck that means but shoutout to 50$ more ugh
1952 2018-12-24 19:22:03 Simple: start burining eth. now its like oil.
1953 2018-12-24 19:21:59 You overegg the CNY pudding. Amount of oil actually settling in CNY is de minimis & for the most part (eg Iran) to distressed sellers. I can't see CNY/USD rate effect approaching effect on shale of tariffs. +ve economic effect of <$2 gasoline beats -ve shale effect hands down
1954 2018-12-24 19:21:19 And Alberta has been raking in the oil profits for decades. It was naive to believe that level of greed and prosperity could have lasted forever. It's like the backward 'States dreaming of the good ol' coal days. The boom is over.

1961 2018-12-24 19:20:38 FACT: Saudi Arabia's leader ordered the vicious murder of an American journalist. The punishment? First access to Syria's oil.
1962 2018-12-24 19:20:05 Well then,maybe someone from OIL COUNTRY shouldn't be in charge of energy policy with doomsday on the horizon. Just a thought.
1963 2018-12-24 19:20:05 In case you haven't noticed, Trump is intentionally causing damage to America: spewing crude oil, toxic coal and pollutions into atmosphere, taking food safety net away from struggling families, caging babies removed from parents and now ruining stock market.
1964 2018-12-24 19:20:01 I advise y’all to get on the “BLACK SEED OIL” it cure everything except getting killed!!
1965 2018-12-24 19:19:59 Beto accepted NO PAC MONEY & 46% of his 800,000 donors gave less than $200. There’s a cap of $2700 for individual donors. Since he raised more money than anyone in senate history, his was #1 in most fields, including clergy. Oil employee
1966 2018-12-24 19:19:58 At most 12 years to the tipping into runaway warming—that's a climate apocalypse; we don't get 2nd chances on this one.

In 2020, it's ALL about TRUST.

As a corporate centrist form Texas, Beto can't be trusted to take on big oil, what's not obvious to you about this?
1967 2018-12-24 19:19:55 The Sperm whale gets its name from the spermaceti organ which fills most of its huge head. In the 18th and 19th centuries, New England whalers sought out the Sperm whale for the valuable spermaceti oil, which makes an exceptionally fine lubricant.
1968 2018-12-24 19:19:53 Oil wash? Never heard of it. Googling now.
1969 2018-12-24 19:19:48 I believe Federal government is not aware of the criminal activity going on at my home to Egbema.
I have never heard or see where tankers are used to transport raw crude oil.
Am not talking of bunkry, or illegally refined diesel or fuel. I am talking of Raw crude.
1970 2018-12-24 19:19:46 Good day to grab some salt and olive oil, mix! pray! start anointing every door and threshold in that joint in the name of the Father,Son and the Holy Spirit then tell that old chief musician how we as a country are going to praise the Lord our God,a and be thankful.

1976 2018-12-24 19:19:25 Freshly milled sourdough rolls. Camembert. Olive oil. Lots of fresh herbs and a crap ton of garlic. Pure deliciousness.
1977 2018-12-24 19:19:18 I lived in Bulgaria during peak rise season.  Like 90% of the rise oil is produced there.  It's overwhelming.  It's almost like something physical and tangible.

1980 2018-12-24 19:19:01 The US has no reason to be in the Middle East.  We are a net exporter of oil now.
1981 2018-12-24 19:18:59 FYI, all of the other signatories of the Iran Deal remained in the deal and you are still allowing Iran to export oil to selected nations. I guess you really can't read.

1985 2018-12-24 19:18:48 That ISN'T what I'm referring to. It was who exactly was donating what to Beto insofar as the oil & gas sector in Texas-and when it was pointed out to him the difference between the same, David moved the goalposts. And badly, at that. 1/
1986 2018-12-24 19:18:47 All you yankees paying dirt cheap prices for heating oil and natural gas this winter; you're welcome. Signed: Texas
1987 2018-12-24 19:18:39 Oil dropped 6% today.
1988 2018-12-24 19:18:38 I don't think the dollar is rising at the moment. Seems like speculation at the moment although winters usually see oil prices rise.
1989 2018-12-24 19:18:38 It's like how u marinade the meat the night b4. What i do is that I put everything togeda, oil, spices, onions, green pepper, the meat,  garlic, etc, stir & put in the fridge or refrigerator. Then I cook it the next day. 

Put the Veggies only when u cooking & the meat is tender
1990 2018-12-24 19:18:34 They need to lock some futures in oil. This slide is artificial. What is happening in Wall Street is insane. They are engineering recession for whatever reason. It may go back up by March.
1991 2018-12-24 19:18:23 Why shouldn't Bands be able to collect royalties from natural resources that are in their territories? That's not asking for a hand out, it's asking to be treated the same as others. 
Byw, I know quite a few indigenous people that WORK in the oil and gas industry.
1992 2018-12-24 19:18:16 Saudi Arabia does not do things to be "nice." Saudi Arabia only does things for money and revenge. Trump you are a stupid man. A very stupid man. Syria has oil fields, the race is on to see who gets control.

1995 2018-12-24 19:18:11 Jesus. We used to take our cars to the Nissan mechanics, within a few years one had developed a horrendous miss, surging and cutting out.

1996 2018-12-24 19:18:02 Do you take tumeric pills or powder?  I have taken tumeric powder with coconut oil, apple cider vinegar, and warm water mixed together. It worked...but tastes awful. If I can take pills and have the same results that would be awesome.

1999 2018-12-24 19:17:32 The stupid thing about the gas and oil industry donations when they were from individuals and were only a small portion of the overall total. The attacks on the voting record that were conflated and twisted to make it seem like he often voted Republicans.

2013 2018-12-24 19:16:47 Got a real good laugh after today's close from a female "analyst" on CNBC saying that balance sheets look good, oil is down, jobs are looking good, yada, yada, etc. But does she recommend buying? "I'm trying to sound bullish", she says, hands in the air.

2020 2018-12-24 19:15:18 Ukraine and Russia headlines out today are looking ominous as was your worry a few days ago. Global power projections indeed. Interesting if, #oil, cross-markets sell off is related to this dynamic. As a songwriter wrote:

2023 2018-12-24 19:14:58 Well, facts can be skewed to seem different than they are.  To say Beto took oil money when he took zero pac money, but small donations from people employed in that foeld, with out stating all of the information, seems more like alternative facts.  Also, Bernie is NOT a Dem
2024 2018-12-24 19:14:57 Sanders took cash from oil/gas/executives. Also voted for Commodity Futures Modernization Act. Now get your facts straight weaboo before I call senpai
2025 2018-12-24 19:14:54 hEOL MY WHOLE ROOM SMELLS SO NICE AFTER I ADDED THE ESSENTIAL OIL TO MY HUMIDIFIER
2026 2018-12-24 19:14:52 Talk about moving the goalposts! Beto O'Rourke got $430,000 out of the $80 million in campaign contributions from people employed in the oil & gas industry: 0.5% of his total contributions. Do you think that is a large percentage?
2027 2018-12-24 19:14:51 My head get oil bro
2028 2018-12-24 19:14:48 I'm so excited to try my oil paints tomorrow

3. Vitamin e oil 
4. DRINK WATER
2030 2018-12-24 19:14:39 Neem oil is also supposed to be super helpful
2031 2018-12-24 19:14:38 Fair. I like olive oil because the flavor. Its also good for marinades.
2032 2018-12-24 19:14:19 China, exporting Iraqi oil? That's one big fucker of a pipeline, did you dream this one?
2033 2018-12-24 19:14:15 Ummm...has he left office? He still has six more years to make good on his promise. Are you aware the second largest source of income, only behind oil, for the entire country of Mexico is money sent from the US? They will do whatever we ask to keep that money flowing.
2034 2018-12-24 19:14:15 i spilled 75/140 gear oil on my beard today. the smell is comparable to rotten eggs. 
2035 2018-12-24 19:14:09 Engineer, sorry to interfere. What have you gained for deploring the attitude he showcased towards the birthday boy? I thought you won't talk again after insulting him but I still realized you aren't satisfied.
2036 2018-12-24 19:14:06 ただの死姦じゃねえか
2037 2018-12-24 19:14:01 It is bitumen which is not far from it. Comes out just like a tar. It is water fracking and there are huge lake like ponds where the water is pumped to after. You can't clean it. They are using good drinking water to do the fracking. We have the hardest to get oil around.
2038 2018-12-24 19:13:49 Excuse me but he accepted donations from oil company executives of all races and gender identities.
2039 2018-12-24 19:13:43 My nose forever burning and I can’t find my peppermint oil

2043 2018-12-24 19:13:32 They are correctly calling it “plain” as the weird orange oil drips down my chin
2044 2018-12-24 19:13:31 I changed the oil in my car and got oil on my hands but didnt notice at first. Then proceeded to scratch my nose and got oil on my nose. It's been a wonderful Christmas eve lmaooo
2045 2018-12-24 19:13:31 I use @jaimelawson08 oil, which appears to work for me, reducing the daily pain from osteoarthritis in my knee

2047 2018-12-24 19:13:11 Hey, Don, your buddy Erdogan is on record saying: “US sanctions on Iran are wrong. For us, they are steps aimed at unbalancing the world; we don't want to live in an imperialist world”.  To appease Turkey you are allowing Turkey to continue to import Iranian oil - what Sanctions?
2048 2018-12-24 19:13:02 oil ocean is perfect how dare you
2049 2018-12-24 19:12:59 I agree with you there, people rather vote against their interest if it means voting for " their " party. This includes both democrats that are bribed by Wall Street or Conservatives bought and paid for by oil and weapon companies.... and naturally the medical companies.
2050 2018-12-24 19:12:58 Baby, it's cold inside/I spent the heating oil money on roofies
2051 2018-12-24 19:12:46 .maybe 2019 would be a good year to have a go at the oil companies.. #ClimateChangeIsReal - make it a theme. #MuckrackingNotFracking ??

2053 2018-12-24 19:12:36 Oil is not only money, its also power
2054 2018-12-24 19:12:32 According to GulfBusiness, Saudi Arabia’s oil export to China has increased by 50%, Russia by 30% but Iran’s oil export to China has decreased by 30%. Iran was counting on Russia and China for its oil shipments but statistics have proved Iran was wrong.
2055 2018-12-24 19:12:31 Cutest little rabbit I ever saw.  I’m going to oil my rabbit-trap 
2056 2018-12-24 19:12:24 Totally agree that was a BS criticism in bad faith. Of course, O'Rourke would be the top in oil and gas contributions from individuals working in that industry - he raised by far the most money AND was running in Texas.

2060 2018-12-24 19:12:07 “the industrial age due to the burning of oil, gas, coal and wood for energy and is continuing to reach concentrations not seen in at least 500,000 years. The impacts include global warming, rising sea levels, melting glaciers and sea ice as well as more severe weather events.”
2061 2018-12-24 19:11:58 Which got us 2 terms of endless wars, drones killing children, peak oil, and a health Care system that still doesn't work for at least 80 million people.
2062 2018-12-24 19:11:53 Trump plunged the Oil markets with his tweets, and never followed with his promise to absolute zero exports of Iranian Oil. Faked the world markets with others ramping up more production. I'm sure he lost the votes of US Oil men and Texas for his 2020. Oil is dragging markets too

2064 2018-12-24 19:11:47 Oil prices have collapsed. US crude teasing at $42. Brent at $50
2065 2018-12-24 19:11:32 Most companies don't have ethical business models and are overvalued in my opinion. It's good for investors to need to take the reigns or their responsibility for fueling those companies. Anyway, the pursuit of wealth has put us in this climate mess. We need more minimalism.
2066 2018-12-24 19:11:32 Why didn't he award them a fully laden Russian oil tanker? They would have just as good a chance of recovering damages.
2067 2018-12-24 19:11:19 The money spent by governments to push the lie is a thousand times more than the oil companies spend trying to correct the record.
2068 2018-12-24 19:11:15 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2069 2018-12-24 19:11:15 U.S. crude oil plunges 6.7% to $42.53/bbl, weakest since mid-2017

2071 2018-12-24 19:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza for dinner today will be: chewy crust with wet motor oil and pepperoni.
2072 2018-12-24 19:10:57 All the good reason to stay out of their home. Stop stealing their fish. Stop polluting their waters stop oil drilling. JUST STOP
2073 2018-12-24 19:10:54 Not if oil makes 10x the amount
2074 2018-12-24 19:10:45 Talking about his votes with the GOP on important legislation voting to increase oil exports, voting against limiting offshore drilling are not "attacks". These are also huge red flags. We can't elect another empty corporate suit that talks and good game but sides with donors 2/
2075 2018-12-24 19:10:44 I never endorsed Bernie. You're defense is just an attachment on someone else. No whataboutism but a delicious fallacy no less. Beto is not evil, but he takes oil money and has a record of supporting oil in government. Disqualifying for a 2020 candidate.
2076 2018-12-24 19:10:41 I cancelled my subscription to the site, which expires in March.  His view is too short-term.  Even in the first leg down in October, he was trying to game a bounce while /NQ went on to fall 400 points that day.  He discouraged my call to short oil when it broke down from 70.
2077 2018-12-24 19:10:33 He is no. Sadly the open pipe leaking oil has been fixed, he jumped ship.
2078 2018-12-24 19:10:28 It is a sinister agenda, European elite take Arabs oil money in turn they give room for the invading and fully aiding the Islamslization of Europe!

2080 2018-12-24 19:10:11 They will get good capitalist oil companies in to build their socialist dream, they would have to because no socialist economy has built their dream
2081 2018-12-24 19:10:06 Nah, I just said coconut oil cause that’s what most cartridges are cut with. But go off sis
2082 2018-12-24 19:10:05 I was only responding to the factual error in your tweet about “oil companies”. I am not here to defend Beto on everthing. However, TPP was a good deal and getting out of it has damaged the US worker and caused many US-imposed worker protections to be scrapped off in TPP11.

2084 2018-12-24 19:10:02 Femi Otedola's sells forte oil,the oil mogul sold 75% of his share holdings in the company
2085 2018-12-24 19:09:47 You mean the Cuba with universal healthcare, tuition free college, universal literacy, and zero homelessness, or do you mean the Venezuela that used its oil revenue to build schools, housing, and offer healthcare to its majority poor all in the teeth of sanctions from the US?
2086 2018-12-24 19:09:44 Once oil began settling in CNY, a/the key to USD oil prices became CNY/USD x-rate.  If US wants to save its shale sector, it will have to devalue USD v. CNY post haste.  Fail that, & US economy will head towards recession

From the entire team Lucas Oil Australia.
2088 2018-12-24 19:09:26 One year we brought ours into the backyard to burn it. Struck a match to it and it went up like someone dropped napalm on an oil refinery. Lasted about 5 seconds
2089 2018-12-24 19:09:23 Not gonna happen but I have an oil well in Utah to sell you if you really believe #SaudiArabia
2090 2018-12-24 19:09:22 Huge problem with oil at these levels for shale. I might enjoy cheaper gas, however, awaiting lots of layoffs in shale country. And bankruptcies. 

And layoffs galore. Then...wait for it...recession.
2091 2018-12-24 19:09:08 We will believe that when we see it happen.  With the low price of oil, Saudi will be lucky to pay their own bills and feed their own people.
Why don't they start in Yemen?

2096 2018-12-24 19:08:22 Oh, frying with olive oil is not good for you. Butter is much better, it doesn't turn into something nasty when you super heat it. 
2097 2018-12-24 19:08:02 He held a meeting yesterday about it, number of Democrats invites to it - zero. At least I am buying some XLE in this market, he will start a war soon enough and oil will spike to recapitalize Russia and KSA ..
2098 2018-12-24 19:07:55 @ZmansEnrgyBrain I don’t have Parsley modeled up - what EV/EBITDA are you showing for next year ~$45? I think at some point core Permian becomes a real takeout target and the size is right for PE
2099 2018-12-24 19:07:50 How do you think deep water oil drilling will be affected?
2100 2018-12-24 19:07:38 Isis was kissing Kissinger. We should never have started the petrodollar play in the Middle East in the 70’s. Isis is a direct result of those policies. Now we’re addicted to oil AND war.

2104 2018-12-24 19:07:13 What is going on here? 

Thought we had this sorted a long time ago. 

Its not just the methane but the devastation of natural habitats for soya  and palm oil and many other crops.
2105 2018-12-24 19:07:00 How can anyone justify all of these rate hikes in the face of $45 oil? Where is the inflation? Who knew that Trump would have been better off with Janet Yellen who saw the necessity for only one rate hike in 8 years to make up for a non-existent Obama fiscal policy.
2106 2018-12-24 19:06:51 #Brent: $50.47 (-6.22%)

2108 2018-12-24 19:06:35 Diet has a lot to do with it & the body changes over time so that may be a factor too. Find good a naturopath. They may be able to see if there is an underlying issue that is causing the reaction you are having. Strengthen your immune system with oregano oil, olive leaf extract
2109 2018-12-24 19:06:31 @realDonaldTrump call your Saudi prince and Putin immediately (double oil production cuts) Then call XI and shake his hand. Have him buy LNG, oil and more beans. Before the end of the year. As for the Mexico wall..take the money out of the private sector prisons. You’re welcome
2110 2018-12-24 19:06:21 And how are thing going to do that? If you haven't noticed, Oil is now at $42/barrel.
2111 2018-12-24 19:06:15 The best uses for homegrown hot peppers are not hot sauces, but hot oil and dried and ground into powder. Both keep longer than hot sauce and can be used in a wider variety of dishes.
2112 2018-12-24 19:06:02 coconut oil be having my skin glowing.
2113 2018-12-24 19:06:01 True that. Pan fry it in some olive oil and it wont dry out. Or sear it good, and grill the steaks.
2114 2018-12-24 19:05:58 @LidlUK when are you going to STOP using palm oil??? It’s almost 2019 & as one of the biggest supermarket chains you SHOULD be following in @IcelandFoods @IcelandFoodsPR foot steps & banning the use of it!!

2117 2018-12-24 19:05:48 #indices now we're seeing some real action! Bear markets are the new norm, at last. Expect a strong DJIA New Year recovery though, then away to the downside again. Meantime, gold & oil are following the IW script too.
Happy Christmas to everyone!
2118 2018-12-24 19:05:45 All dodgy corrupt oil owners.
2119 2018-12-24 19:05:40 Like all this happens in a vaccume that surrounds Trump. The #resistance has no effect? Check yourself, a lot of this petty sniping is not in the greater intrest of the country, now all over a few measly dollars.
2120 2018-12-24 19:05:36 The notion of separation is hilarious. So the only avenue of sale they would have then would be to the US which is what they’re complaining about now, only Trump would probably put big tariffs on their oil and they wouldn’t be able to sell it for as much as they get now.
2121 2018-12-24 19:05:09 Hello I was wondering what you put to seal the painting I’m having trouble finding for my oil paintings
2122 2018-12-24 19:05:06 The war started over the oil pipeline that Iran wants to run through Syria. It’s how the Elites that started this war was making their money while spending millions on a war and killing our beloved service men!

2124 2018-12-24 19:05:02 I mean, it’s only TERRIBLE news if the CEOs of the oil majors remain steadfastly committed to maximizing shareholder value by poisoning communities and endangering future generations... 
2125 2018-12-24 19:04:48 Hay q ver q hacen. Todos salen mal parados con baja de comodities.. Chile x el cobre , nosotros x soja ,trigo etc , baja de oil sólo en EEUU baja inflación. Demás países no. Mira Francia los chalecos amarillos ... Y ni el frío de EEUU y Europa hace subir wti

2127 2018-12-24 19:04:32 Yup i rem $110-120 oil changes in my beamer. Bless that german engineering 
2128 2018-12-24 19:04:31 If you think the 20% drop in the stock market is bad, oil is down 45% in 10 weeks.
2129 2018-12-24 19:04:26 I'm wondering what language they're speaking when all that Alberta oil money goes to Quebec!
2130 2018-12-24 19:04:26 It looks like capitulation in both oil and equities. They are too correlated for last two months and especially last days, the same pattern. And, surprise, in equities Real estate and Utilities were the biggest losers today, despite narrative of safe assets...
2131 2018-12-24 19:04:13 Szechuan Empire on Five Mile, east of Middlebelt, in Livonia. Only complaint: They don't seem to get their dishes as spicy as they once did, so I asked for extra hot oil.
2132 2018-12-24 19:04:10 Oil is below $43 a barrel!!

2141 2018-12-24 19:03:04 Not sure if the Saudis have enough financial resources to fulfil this with oil at an 18 month low around $42.50 and they require oil at double the current price approx to balance their books due to their generous social security. They are hurting! Ramifications for the rest.
2142 2018-12-24 19:02:52 Listennnnn imma use it ok.  it’s cuss I was experimenting this oil my momma made 
2143 2018-12-24 19:02:48 I just dropped a bottle of olive oil on my bare foot. How's your day going?
2144 2018-12-24 19:02:44 put lavender oil on it!

2146 2018-12-24 19:02:25 Problem with the inflationary bust thesis right now is oil prices, which have a huge impact on inflation and are down around 40%. Unlikely to see prices spiral up unless commidities rally.
2147 2018-12-24 19:02:08 It is done now...And is forcing more selling....It may get very ugly later this week. Oil as well was a disaster...Down almost USD 3....

2149 2018-12-24 19:01:33 CBD oil is worth exploring for anxiety, pain, and sleeplessness. I’ve heard great things about the mouth oil, and I use the body oils/sprays after workouts. “Veteran” users of THC may find CBD oil doesn’t work for them, but I think you could benefit from it.
2150 2018-12-24 19:01:32 I hate all the "oil clubs", so I'd rather LFC winning it... Football should unite against oil clubs like city, psg, chelski...
2151 2018-12-24 19:01:21 The real reason the markets are crashing:

Oil is from funneled tsunami debris, kelp mostly. 
Kelp is 95% salt water. 
The kelp dries and salt concentrations rise.
Thus salt preserves the organics so you can burn them.
Oil is coastal and shallow by nature.

2153 2018-12-24 19:01:06 You don’t realize how much oil we produce. Nothing hypocritical about it.

2161 2018-12-24 19:00:00 Pls how can I get the oil, kindly refer me to where I can order it. Thanks
2162 2018-12-24 18:59:51 This is an example of how NBC spins the “truth”. What’s the percentage drop? It’s like when you report on oil production. You report in barrels per day. But an oil spill you report in gallons. Both are true, but gallons is spin to further your agenda. It sounds much worse.
2163 2018-12-24 18:59:44 Yes Christmas ngayon pero let us not forget na di na available ang Chicken Oil sa Mang Inasal! Stay woke mga siszt!!!
2164 2018-12-24 18:59:32 La verdad nunca pensé q el  oil estaría 42 50.
2165 2018-12-24 18:59:24 Hmm, what happened in the last 3 wks?
Trade? No, that's the same
Oil? No, that's still down
Wars? No

Dems take house and call it a blue wave? Yeah
Fed, against all our wishes, raises rates and announces more hikes? Yeah
@SenSchumer holds up wall funding? Yeah

What could it be?
2166 2018-12-24 18:59:21 When will Wonderful stop using oil waste water to irrigate its products? Do you know, @AndreaLeon?
2167 2018-12-24 18:59:14 More pipelines equals more trucks, big big trucks because Alberta wants to expand the oil sands by 60%.

2172 2018-12-24 18:58:25 Plus, I still have suspicions that oil prices have been manipulated. The whole run up to the Iran sanctions only to give them a slap on the wrist ... that was deliberate. Someone made out big time.

2185 2018-12-24 18:56:28 It’s gonna take at least 2-3 years to recover the losses I’ve incurred from this snake oil salesman, jack-leg clown of a president with that damn dyed badger fur glued on the top of his head.  Dammit!!!!
2186 2018-12-24 18:56:18 Not withstanding means, in spite off. So you are saying, in spite of the fact natives own land over which pipelines want to tresspass & that oil extraction is dangerous to Native of health near afort Mac, Trudeau should ignore all this & satisfy the money greed of Albertans.
2187 2018-12-24 18:56:16 ..... and banana oil.

2197 2018-12-24 18:55:35 Doe mek Kozmo distract us from the fact that we doe find the oil yet.
2198 2018-12-24 18:55:18 Nah, greed my guy, top dawgs running the show, what would you think would happen with the economy if oil wasn’t needed anymore, they built a electronic system with magnets that was able to generate power, only thing that would need charged every few years where the magnets.
2199 2018-12-24 18:55:08 using tea tree oil as a toner is the most refreshing thing i've ever decided to do

2201 2018-12-24 18:55:01 I think Cardi B is more flexible on oil production and against monopolies in general. More for fare trade and free journalism I think. Cardi all the way. Super don backs another loser. Get on @iamcardib donnie.
2202 2018-12-24 18:54:59 Oil too?

2209 2018-12-24 18:54:32 Right he was choosing to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. He did find wind and solar.
2210 2018-12-24 18:54:31 I know the smell of pink oil lotion a mile away
2211 2018-12-24 18:54:15 For example, in terms of climate change, the extraction industries would love a “cap and trade” system and a bunch of wars to protect their investment. That’s big govt.  but they don’t want a revenue neutral carbon tax and a withdrawal from fighting oil wars. That’s small govt.
2212 2018-12-24 18:54:03 I though I packed my face wash and I realized that I’ve been using my massage oil to wash my face  cystic acne
2213 2018-12-24 18:53:48 Ah, but were the interventions ever truly about helping Middle Eastern (or any other) civilians? Seems to me the "cops of the world" policies were more about feeding the military-industrial complex and the resource exploiters. $700+B for $500 hammers and "let's take the oil."
2214 2018-12-24 18:53:47 Try castor oil!! I saw a bretman rock video that helped lol
2215 2018-12-24 18:53:46 December 24 1969 - The oil company Phillips Petroleum made the first oil discovery in the Norwegian sector of North Sea
2216 2018-12-24 18:53:41 I wonder if he knows that turkey was allowing Islamic fighters into Syria to join ISIS . And that he was buying oil from them? And selling them weapons? And plans on kicking out the Kurds and moving in the Sunni Arabs, aka the ISIS base? I want all our troops withdrawn, but....
2217 2018-12-24 18:53:34 They certainly use a lot of middle Eastern oil

2223 2018-12-24 18:52:46 Coconut oil just hit differently on dark skin.
2224 2018-12-24 18:52:33 I’m pulling for Beto 2020 because of his energy and youthful charisma. Imagine how smoothly he’ll be voting alongside with the Republicans, how charismatically he’ll be taking all that oil money.
2225 2018-12-24 18:52:29 I agree with you on this one, especially since it is pretty obvious Turkey was aiding ISIS in their sale of stolen oil, purchasing weapons, recruiting manpower, etc for most of the war.  Erdogan is a two-faced rat.
2226 2018-12-24 18:52:29 What happened?   "Inovo BV, the Dutch corporation owned by Kamil Ekim Alptekin, claims to be the sole Turkish representative in Ratio Oil Exploration."
2227 2018-12-24 18:52:16 Very interesting point. The big oil companies own those trucks and they are paying the drivers to protest. Big oil is pissed off because they were only offered loans not Outright grants.
2228 2018-12-24 18:52:16 Oil dey my head nwanne
2229 2018-12-24 18:52:15 oil fell to some pretty solid support just above $42. That is really oversold now.

2235 2018-12-24 18:51:49 lol china is correct, Trudeau is the King of double standards like importing Oil from Saudi Arabia....
2236 2018-12-24 18:51:44 maybe a bunch of people actually genuinely don't want a law enforcement officer or someone real popular with oil executives to be the democratic nominee for actual reasons. you all ignoring that is what is fucking tiresome!
2237 2018-12-24 18:51:43 You mean this guy who supports oil and gas in the face of catastrophic climate change? The guy who resists single payer health care while the rest of the civilized world has it? That guy is the future?

2239 2018-12-24 18:51:36 U.S. oil prices take biggest drop in 3 months, tumbling along with stocks Monday
2240 2018-12-24 18:51:34 This kind Christmas self lots of people been complaining no money no money yet them be buying rice and chicken,why them be not stick to yam and red oil as per tradition
2241 2018-12-24 18:51:30 U.S. oil suffers worst 1-day decline in about three months as risk assets get bludgeoned
2242 2018-12-24 18:51:30 Given the meltdown in oil and US stocks these should have fallen more.
2243 2018-12-24 18:51:22 There is a lag effect between price & addition/reduction of rigs of around 16-20 weeks. So those rigs were probably paid for & scheduled back in August or July 

So the effect of the cure collapse in oil prices will be probably appear in March or April

2249 2018-12-24 18:50:47 are they not nationalising industries and increasingly restricting private property rights as well as the means of production?

you only need no control key industries to kill the economy, like how they destroyed the oil company

2252 2018-12-24 18:50:31 This has nothing to do with Texas. If he wants to run for Senate in 2020 I'm all for it. This is about the national left rejecting him as a presidential candidate for being an oil shill. He has a voting record. It is clear what his priorities are and why anyone wants to be alive

2261 2018-12-24 18:50:08 The next 28 days offers huge opportunity on ftse stocks ... bear market seem to be sentiment and geopolitical driven and that is historically short term .... I am optimistic overall and intend to buy oil majors and banks :)
2262 2018-12-24 18:50:06 I have never put an olive of any color or cure in my mouth that wasn't an oily, bitter disappointment. Olive oil is fine! Just not olives.

2264 2018-12-24 18:49:58 We were there to suppress outside threats wmds terrorists groups etc. And were paid in oil royalties. We established a democracy in a land that was in shambles. We helped those people and profited at the same time. Mutually beneficial like I said.
2265 2018-12-24 18:49:55 I don't just understand. Seems they've been patronizing Power oil company
2266 2018-12-24 18:49:48 Very unlikely. Oil is down 35%+ and inflation has peaked. The bottom is in on T-bonds. It can pull back at some point but it's not going back to the lows. XLU is a whole different dynamic. Recessions hit utility earnings as do lower energy prices, particularly since deregulation.

2278 2018-12-24 18:48:59 Low crude prices makes the cost of extraction unviable (See tar sands).  This results in less exploration, less extraction & refinement. Moves that A+ rated oil companies to Watch List. Worse it impacts the peripheral suppliers - everything from water haulers to rig services.
2279 2018-12-24 18:48:56 Thanks! Slight change of plans. I’m going with your German buttercream. Inside the buche will have a bit of peppermint oil & powdered candy. Outside will be chocolate and topped with chocolate bark. Either way, I’m off to make pudding lol
Why do I let my kids talk me into this?
2280 2018-12-24 18:48:37 You really have no clue. Oil down another 7% trading at $50. That’s down from about $80 a few months ago. I think the Saudis have to worry about their economy before reconstructing Syria. #AlertTheDaycareStaff
2281 2018-12-24 18:48:35 I'm guessing, like most of Corporate America, they have record profits. Can we stop endless (Socialist) Corporate Wealthfare? Trump (Oil and Gas's fave climate denier) won't stop it for his top donors. 
I hope they win this lawsuit & hope people wake up. Quick.

He’s not Aaron Bastani. He’s Clement Attlee.
2284 2018-12-24 18:48:31 @ddailyreport To be able to fund the 2019 budget, we must produce above 2million barrel of oil daily. The big question here is: is this visible? #TheDailyReport

2288 2018-12-24 18:48:08 Sure they will but only as a land grab for their oil
2289 2018-12-24 18:48:07 Centrists on Beto;

He lives in Texas. An oil state. It's ok to be for oil if you live in an oil state.

Meanwhile, we have 12 years left to drastically reduce our emissions and the House Democrats just crippled a committee that could do something about it.
2290 2018-12-24 18:47:59 Straightening my hair for the 3rd time in a matter of 2 weeks, gonna soakkkkk my hair in coconut oil after this is all over
2291 2018-12-24 18:47:56 イくときはイくって言えって言われてるでしょいちろ~
2292 2018-12-24 18:47:54 Oh stop talking crap it was Scotland’s oil revenues that secured the loans from the world bank to stop the uk banks from folding
2293 2018-12-24 18:47:53 So guess who doesn’t have a car that works at all anymore because the people who changed my oil didn’t tighten my filter and my engine is fucked and now I don’t have a car that’s drivable at all. Merry fucking Christmas to me, fuck me very much.
2294 2018-12-24 18:47:51 Wonderfully, if
A, you stay up fairly late to baste it
B. You have it legs to the top overnight
C. The stuffing is quite wet and has some butter or oil in it
2295 2018-12-24 18:47:42 ppl who have never had acne in their lives be like "i use neutrogena pink grapefruit cleanser and coconut oil to moisturize"
2296 2018-12-24 18:47:39 Even big oil companies such as Exxon have gotten on the global smarmy bandwagon. Disgusting and inane.
2297 2018-12-24 18:47:29 As someone who will be participating in #Veganuary for the first time, I wish to say how much I enjoyed watching @jakeyapp make Seitan on Periscope. So far, I’ve only managed to smash the olive oil on the floor but then I am only a beginner.
2298 2018-12-24 18:47:23 My mans engine spit a piston into the oil pan
2299 2018-12-24 18:47:17 Someone removed my coconut oil from the bathroom. Expect some Christmas fireworks because I’m ready to fight.
2300 2018-12-24 18:47:13 He thinks university scientists somehow make more than those employed by the oil companies.
2301 2018-12-24 18:47:04 Changing the oil on the jeep.  Fuck... I need help.  Lmao

BJP govt under PM Modi has inaugurated the Paradip Oil Refinery & laid the foundation of Paradip- Hyderabad pipeline of Indian Oil Corp which will not only strengthen Odisha’s energy sector but will also boost employment & investment in the region

2305 2018-12-24 18:47:01 You love how useful populism is to manipulate those who don't know any better through fear, and appealing to their sense of misfortune while intimately you're the same kind of snake oil salesmen responsible for their plight in the first place.
2306 2018-12-24 18:46:49 Why do black parents love whipping out the castor oil the day after Christmas ?
2307 2018-12-24 18:46:45 Which essential oil is best for getting people to stop talking to you?
2308 2018-12-24 18:46:33 Given the gains since the crash I think a slowing down of the markets is not unreasonable, to some extent the real economy has to catch up with the markets. As for oil, if demand is falling and the US is exporting, I think we might be seeing the dawn of a new normal.

2312 2018-12-24 18:46:19 Got some advice for you. No don’t text the fuck boy back, yes do eat that, and coconut oil.

2316 2018-12-24 18:46:05 at least you got the brand right, you should try the olive oil one after
2317 2018-12-24 18:46:01 Strength in Yen a major concern - smidgen above 110 currently. Global equities in free fall. Oil at 18 month low - $42.50. Middle Eastern banks under pressure- contagion fears.
2318 2018-12-24 18:45:58 Closed all my Position,
Don’t wanna get stuck in holidays,
It was good overall,
Except few trades in last hours,
I got the the Oil trade wrong,

But the good is I use S.L
With 4:1 ratio,
I got stopped in WTi long @ 44.50
Need to analyse market again before new position.
2319 2018-12-24 18:45:54 US is rocking!  4% GDP growth;  lowest unemployment for minorities & women in decades; ISIS is done; US top oil producer on earth & energy independent; SNAP recipients down; US embassy now in Jerusalem; tax cuts were great; consumer confidence high; Reps control Senate & POTUS.
2320 2018-12-24 18:45:53 Oil dropped 7%.
2321 2018-12-24 18:45:50 Your orange is punching their oil.
2322 2018-12-24 18:45:47 今年もケーキで胃もたれなぅ
2323 2018-12-24 18:45:45 Agreed. Then again, if China consumed same amount of crude per capita as US, it would consume most of the oil in the world; same with India. Not plausible, but even a small fraction of both (due to growth + incomplete electrification) would prevent market from being too slack.
2324 2018-12-24 18:45:15 Where is it in terms of increasing flavor? I find protein, unless it’s a ribeye, needs butter or olive oil.

2328 2018-12-24 18:44:38 still expecting this bounce in oil?
2329 2018-12-24 18:44:12 Isn't hot eba and palm oil yummy?

2330 2018-12-24 18:44:06 @kairyssdal  What's your take on the massive fall of oil today? Nearly 7% is more than due to glut and even the DOW.
2331 2018-12-24 18:43:49 oil brushes are so much fun
2332 2018-12-24 18:43:47 yes,, the handful of thongs is for my gf ppl.. time to look at motor oil
2333 2018-12-24 18:43:40 As Saudi Arabia have just published their 2019 budget that revolves around $70 oil, only one thing is going to happen. Saudi still controls the main levers on the oil price as the biggest 'swing producer'.
2334 2018-12-24 18:43:40 That and the Arab Oil Embargo of October 1973.
2335 2018-12-24 18:43:37 No more oil 
2336 2018-12-24 18:43:31 It’s worse than gibberish. Trump believes that the wages the fed govt is not paying employees over the shutdown can be spent on the Wall. He either does not understand that those wages must be repaid or does not agree. Similar to Iraqi oil wells...
2337 2018-12-24 18:43:26 Go through our history, during the golf war, we made massive money from the sales of crude oil.We were very rich and proud financial of many independent struggles in Africa
2338 2018-12-24 18:43:24 The gas is down because the oil market plunged
2339 2018-12-24 18:43:24 I have a medical marijuana licence. Have tried the oil. I have pot lying around. I don’t like being stoned. Perils of opiates etc. We now have legalized pot, need to go in and find edibles

2345 2018-12-24 18:42:53 It’s so essential, it’s now just ‘oil’.
2346 2018-12-24 18:42:49 I’m like 6 thousand miles over for an oil change so I jokingly asked for one for Christmas and these people got me a fcking gift certificate for an oil change
2347 2018-12-24 18:42:46 For you. Remember you stil have to pay. What if someone can’t afford insurance every month or if something happens like a flat tire, oil change etc.
2348 2018-12-24 18:42:36 Your policies are crashing the stock market and oil is in a free fall.  Bankruptcies and job losses will follow. All because of your wall, shutting the govt, tweeting about low oil prices and China tariffs. Great job Donny
2349 2018-12-24 18:42:21 How is it that oil is at multi year lows and I paid $1.40 a litre this morning? When oil was $150 we paid $1.50. Electrification can't come soon enough.
2350 2018-12-24 18:42:12 Lol. 
My Xmas is gonna be in Sseguku (my village). Oil wekka Kaliisa me I have a village 
2351 2018-12-24 18:42:10 My favorite essential oil blend being diffused, sitting in the presence of our Creator before all the festivities tonight was the best choice I made all week #hallelujah #babyjesus #youareWORTHit 
2352 2018-12-24 18:42:03 Pouring poppers into one of those essential oil diffusers.
2353 2018-12-24 18:42:02 I agree, how can you have a 4.2 and 3.5% GDP in the last 2 quarters with full employment and over 70% of GDP comes from consumer spending and then be in inflation, plus low oil and no measurable "real" inflation
2354 2018-12-24 18:42:02 no kap i think yall b kappin on yall high smpking dem oil pens  det shit is poooooh

2356 2018-12-24 18:41:35 If our ambitions are to actually address climate change, then yeah, you are absolutely right. Beto: voted against offshore oil drilling bans and broke the no fossil fuel money pledge.
2357 2018-12-24 18:41:03 He is reactionary & works in the oil industry. 

He is basically everything I am against.

2374 2018-12-24 18:39:48 Yeah but wouldn't you expect a presidential candidate with a lot of connections to oil and gas, even normal connections from said State, to make them more deferential to oil and gas interest.

2377 2018-12-24 18:39:23 It's also because they want all those off the road permanently given they are oil related and having them on the road, no matter the cause or reason, is counter to their mission.
2378 2018-12-24 18:39:21 Pretty sure Beto can get enough money from his oil donors.
2379 2018-12-24 18:39:20 @CNBC Nothing justifies oil price today period.
2380 2018-12-24 18:39:12 But that oil tho..
2381 2018-12-24 18:39:12 Shiva, shiva, oil is down 5-6%.

If this is not good news for India, I dont know what it is.

I think this gives @narendramodi @PMOIndia to splurge money on others.

Once BJP wins in 2019, they can re-strengthen economy.
2382 2018-12-24 18:39:05 I think if you went back to dec 2006 and read the news back then youd have alot of dejavus. 100 oil is totally possible in 2019 just like it was in 2007.

2390 2018-12-24 18:38:27 Don’t forget the gallons of refined oil for lubrication. It’s a farce. Free the oilsands!! If you do Canada will have enough money to fund every hairbrained scheme that comes down the pike. Maybe one will be the future of energy. Until then stop doing what you’re doing.
2391 2018-12-24 18:38:10 Wow. Not six weeks ago I heard an oil analyst very confidently dismiss outright the notion of any price below 60… WTI closed today at 42 and change.
2392 2018-12-24 18:38:02 $CL_F that is just nuts; and this is with the OPEC production cuts when oil was $55.  What a scam.
2393 2018-12-24 18:37:51 I warned you about stock market over a month ago. The worst day in history on Xmas eve today down 600 points. Apple is down 35% from highs set in October. Crude Oil is at lowest level since 2015. Wednesday will get year end fishing pole out as continued tax selling will happen.
2394 2018-12-24 18:37:49 I am stunned...I was out of oil but sold some 44.50 puts...Again losing money...The speed of the decline is incredible.
2395 2018-12-24 18:37:47 Easy-First the earth cooled then there were Arabs and oil. Then came Rothschild and banking to form a new world order. They tried with Hitler, but didn't work so well so they bought Congress and life was good, then there was TRUMP and they all said WTF!
2396 2018-12-24 18:37:45 Right, because thebuy backs slowing down aren’t a drag on the market.

Oil dropping as well.

Nor interest rates going up

2399 2018-12-24 18:37:24 Stock market fall, oil price collapse, global narrow money cratering all foreshadow a  significant 2019 recession imo. Epicenter is in China/Asia/Europe though. Think is confusing US investors as US always lead in to global recessions previously. This time it is different.
2400 2018-12-24 18:37:13 えっちゃん！！調教はどう！！？
2401 2018-12-24 18:37:08 Most forecasts in the case against $100 oil bank on mega U.S. growth; reductions in capex, fear in the hearts of shale investors, seems to be antagonists of the $50 oil believer. Put halts/delays on Canadian-U.S. pipelines, Canada cuts/curtailment, OPEC member instability. And?
2402 2018-12-24 18:37:03 45% drop in oil is a kick in the balls for Russia.  Mango Mussolini should watch out that he doesn't  catch that famous Putin specialty - the plutonium flu.

2430 2018-12-24 18:34:27 Because the liberals want to distroy the oil and gas  in this country so we can be dependent on every other country that is the trugrope way well 2019 is around the corner so it will be good bye scum bags .
2431 2018-12-24 18:34:25 Maybe they will just go in and cut everyone up and take the oil. #AlertTheDayCareStaff #USAMilitaryCoupNow

2433 2018-12-24 18:34:17 Oil tanking- $43 on inventories, warm weather and macro worries. #gasprices have more room to fall.
2434 2018-12-24 18:34:11 In fact, we should probably nationalize all oil companies in Canada and the United States to ensure they keep doing so.

Let's follow Venezuela's example.

2441 2018-12-24 18:33:39 Thanks for giving it a try! Since we use whole spruce tips (rather than oil or flavorings) it’s a slightly more subtle flavor. The spruce serves to enhance the hop flavor and does make an intense finish. Cheers 
2442 2018-12-24 18:33:37 does this mean it is a good time to buy some quality stocks...like energy (oil & power sector)???

2444 2018-12-24 18:33:25 @tacobell just had the most unbelievable experience at a taco Bell. Spent 45 minutes and had the same food remade with burnt oil. Manager kept telling me that that's how new oil smells without personally trying or smelling the food. Completely inedible food. Refused to help.

2447 2018-12-24 18:33:11 It’s the UN observers   Watch the vid. I’m not saying Assad or Syria were perfect but it was never a failed state   It’s oil rich and dollar shy   Had to be broken
2448 2018-12-24 18:33:10 You're right.

Producers of all shapes and sizes should produce oil at a loss and invest the hundreds of billions of dollars necessary to keep doing so out of the goodness of their hearts.

2451 2018-12-24 18:32:55 Oil futures just hit 42.375, new low and day isn't over yet. H & J still believes low to mid 30s and maybe even low to mid 20s is possible in 2019-20.
2452 2018-12-24 18:32:47 This is like when Bush n Cheney would go to Saudi Arabia to lower oil prices and they’d automatically go up .25 #stopit
2453 2018-12-24 18:32:36 Oil $42.50 down 7%! Crash - serious implications for major oil producing nations. Who would have thought only two months ago so much talk of $100 a barrel. Oil peaked this year on October 2nd - same day as the killing of Jamal Khashoggi. Coincidence?
2454 2018-12-24 18:32:34 And as I struggled to shape the goopy cookie dough into round little balls, I couldn't help but wonder: Did I put too much canola oil into the batter?

2471 2018-12-24 18:31:29 Oil based steroids will show up for at least a year which is why people stopped using them. There are documented cases of oil based ones staying in your system for years. If it’s not injected properly & is injected into fat cells it doesn’t break down normally.

2524 2018-12-24 18:27:03 @SaraEisen Liesman is right, the more you talk, the worse it seems. Say your mechanic calls you up on Saturday: "Did your car blow up yet?" You exclaim, "Why, is something wrong?" "No, just a normal check." On a Saturday! Not asking if you've changed the oil, but if the car died!
2525 2018-12-24 18:27:03 @realDonaldTrump talked down oil because he doesn't know its 10% of GDP and he blames the fed for slowing growth.  HE IS RESPONSIBLE and he has wiped out the Energy Sector.  the $XLE is now down 33% on the year and 20% in a few weeks.  WHERE IS @CNNBusiness covering this?
2526 2018-12-24 18:27:00 It is directly affect the elite class and upper middle class. May increase corruption. Never going to happen or possible only if oil crisis will back.

2557 2018-12-24 18:24:28 "How does such nonsense get Alberta oil to China", at this time common sense should dictate discretion given what is going on between Canada + China, even from this appointed senator, oh wait as a senator she's unaccountable + appears to be stepping right into foreign affairs.

2573 2018-12-24 18:22:06 F... #Syria, . We have been there for almost 17 years now. It’s time to pack the bags &return home. Israel can defend itself without our help. Oil companies can do the same. Military contractors are going to survive, as well. And, since when the Ds are for more wars? #nowars
2574 2018-12-24 18:22:00 ไปเด้อ 555
2575 2018-12-24 18:21:55 And.. we protect natural habitats, have strict environmental guidelines, return the land to its original state or better, after responsibly harvesting natural resources. My whole family works in the oil patch, so this matters to me.
2576 2018-12-24 18:21:47 This ear infection is NO HOE fuck this sweet oil bullshit I’m to the er 
2577 2018-12-24 18:21:46 There is so many benefits to Electric cars like most of  I spend on electricity stays here in USA supporting the local economy nobody has to go to war to get fuel for my car we should be spending billions on helping more people get electric cars not protecting  middle east oil

2579 2018-12-24 18:21:41 まじで眠気こねえな なんかウケる
2580 2018-12-24 18:21:40 received an oil burner as a gift wow looks like i'll be getting more scented candles from now on
2581 2018-12-24 18:21:37 Bearded folk, shave tonight. Shaft all those unimaginative bastards getting you beard oil tomorrow.
2582 2018-12-24 18:21:33 All's well, thank you!  Hope to see you soon! X
2583 2018-12-24 18:21:31 Oil settles down another 5% $43.36
2584 2018-12-24 18:21:30 Don’t worry! I’m an oil painter who has been banned from helping out at my Aunt’s cookie bouquet store for similar reasons. Icing is my kryptonite..disables all my artistic ability!! 
2585 2018-12-24 18:21:29 This! I want to overpay for oil paintings of my rescue pets posing in big bowls of fruit and flowers
2586 2018-12-24 18:21:24 Ask your local oil producers in Oklahoma and Texas. You think they’re happy with $40?
2587 2018-12-24 18:21:16 I am liking the oil stocks for a big snap back, but it won't happen to April-May (unless geopolitical). Regardless of outside sources, cheaper prices equal greater demand and already reading a lot of permanian companies pulling back on CAPEX
2588 2018-12-24 18:21:02 Honestly, they looked like prawns floating in oil at first and I thought you’d lost it completely 
2589 2018-12-24 18:21:00 ヤクザわかんないよ～
2590 2018-12-24 18:21:00 So “Oil Change USA,” some fly by night outfit with an axe to grind comes out and decides it can declare any individual contribution it feels like as “oil money” after the fact. People don’t go for that dishonest bs. No corporate money, no PAC money. The facts stand.
2591 2018-12-24 18:20:58 @geoambrose are you buying into the 43 to 42 oil and 2347 es
Idea, thoughts?

2593 2018-12-24 18:20:51 So I ask @karanbhasin95 what he wants for #NewYear2019 gift and here is what he tells me

1. Stable rupee
2. Stable markets
3. Robust growth
4. Low oil prices
5. Low inflation

I am done with this oversmart kid!

2596 2018-12-24 18:20:38 God is too faithful to fail! Just when I thought the oil will finish in my barrel. I was given $1000 in cash today. Faithful God!!!
2597 2018-12-24 18:20:13 Probably filled with out of Oil & Gas workers
2598 2018-12-24 18:20:13 In 1946, Oil workers union votes not to fight the dismissal of 50 union leaders from their jobs in the govmt-owned oil industry.
2599 2018-12-24 18:20:12 Oil prices will now go up. The Saudis are extremely nasty people. Many are Islamic extremists.
2600 2018-12-24 18:20:02 Bio oil aja, lumayan ampuh cuma rada mahal
2601 2018-12-24 18:19:58 Confused Rishi, are you saying NBers should pay higher carbon taxes?
In 2016, 60% of NB Power’s generation was carbon-free nuclear, hydro, wind, biomass.
The other 40% is coal, natgas and oil, which is the portion subject to the federal carbon pricing system (aka OBPS).
2602 2018-12-24 18:19:56 Merry Earpmas! 
I'm working on an oil painting from the sexy pink fog episode right now...But I always have time for more pastel drawings of my favourite cast! 
2603 2018-12-24 18:19:56 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
2604 2018-12-24 18:19:54 قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم والذي نفس محمد بيده؛ لا يسمع بي أحد من هذه الأمة يهودي ولا نصراني ثم يموت ولم يؤمن بالذي أرسلت به إلا كان من أصحاب النار. رواه مسلم.
2605 2018-12-24 18:19:53 Potatoes are a starchy vegetable (like corn). In my midwest experience, It's a side dish (typically made w/ cream/ cheese)& served with a more healthy green veggie/salad. Logically, potatoes ARE a vegetable because they aren't a fruit, meat, dairy, bread or sugar/oil. #MerryXmas
2606 2018-12-24 18:19:43 I’ll drink the oil hot so it will fry the chicken in my stomach

2608 2018-12-24 18:19:30 His time is up.. I can’t believe people still think he is current on social issues.  Is Kentucky still in the 1960’s. He doesn’t agree with climate change. Wants the Keystone Pipeline and gets oil money, imagine that!!! We need a new generation of leaders!
2609 2018-12-24 18:19:29 My mom just put CBD oil in my tendinitis ankle
2610 2018-12-24 18:19:23 I suspect they've been burning the midnight oil on Parliament Hill in Ottawa. This is indeed a global catastrophe. It's amazing that anyone imagines this to be either acceptable or normal. It is neither. How is America functioning ?
2611 2018-12-24 18:19:23 I should of asked for an oil change for Christmas  shit is expensive
2612 2018-12-24 18:19:14 나 내년에 7살이야

2614 2018-12-24 18:19:00 Escape by death should not be an option. She already lost part of her life span for the Heppel Oil gland implant. So death means nothing to her. No I think a very far away planet of harsh conditions & no one else around would hurt her mind & spirit permanently. Imagine farming...

2620 2018-12-24 18:18:53 My rich person hobby would be my vineyard and rose garden in Italy, with a vanity winery and olive oil company. I’d design the labels myself.

2624 2018-12-24 18:18:40 3/3. The companies of BP, Shell, etc. are not the same as oil itself.  Tropicana is not the same as the orange itself.  Woolworths is not the same as the sheep itself.  And the Jolly Green Giant is not the same as a string bean itself...
2625 2018-12-24 18:18:39 Saudis are almost bankrupt if oil doesn't bounce
2626 2018-12-24 18:18:32 Oil Life 100%
2627 2018-12-24 18:18:31 Looks good (v good)  I can ship you appropriate font.  My name looks like it's been stencilled on an empty oil barrel. Good thinking.  Face will be Blackett 1925 passport photo with gold plated paperclip (I have MI5 image) holding it at an angle. More than that would be clutter.

2631 2018-12-24 18:18:19 Bill, whats your view on recent oil drop?
2632 2018-12-24 18:18:19 It's the one mistake he has made. These low oil prices will kill the shale developers. They are his voters and they will be punished. I was mostly out of oil stocks by June. I'm buying again, perhaps a little early. $BP $CVX $RDS.A $XOM $EQNR are all great PEs with great divvys!
2633 2018-12-24 18:18:15 Ok.
Take Bitcoin max to now
& Oil max of last 4 years to now.
Average drop %
Apply that drop percentage
To Dow Jones & S&P and waalaa!
You have your floor.

2636 2018-12-24 18:18:01 Renewables have a long way to go. They are in their infancy. Even when they are impactful, they cannot fully replace oil. Canada is sub 2% of global emissions. Better for us all to use Canadian oil as much as possible vs foreign oil

2640 2018-12-24 18:17:33 Started with ppl positively (and sloppily) comparing candidates to Obama. The critiques followed that comparison. And yes, while we’re at it, maybe it’s time to rethink Obama’s legacy especially wrt climate in light of him bragging about making us the biggest oil producer
2641 2018-12-24 18:17:28 With #oil #wti at this prices& US/@US_OGA now biggest oil producer by country, can't see how US can maintain GDP. The kicker...#China will save $billions if oil stay this low much longer. Question, I have, why do US shale keep pumping more when it makes more sense to pull back?
2642 2018-12-24 18:17:25 The amount of olive oil me and my mum go through is actually disgusting
2643 2018-12-24 18:17:07 Dog ford speaks rubbish carbon tax every thing that’s cruel oil. Clean environment but it’s ok . Doug you won. I’m moving to Australia live off the grid. You’ll see. Greed will have you flat out on your butt,

2652 2018-12-24 18:15:47 Whip together 4 cups donuts with 1/3 cup ice cream. Add generous amounts of Olive Oil. Bake for 30 minutes at 200 degrees. Serve warm.
2653 2018-12-24 18:15:41 I hate getting oil changes
2654 2018-12-24 18:15:28 He has been working against West Canada since he took office. We could have had that pipeline for free, and prosper for the entire people. Instead of importing refined Saudi oil from US
2655 2018-12-24 18:15:23 Why did Beto break his no-oil-money pledge?
2656 2018-12-24 18:15:22 Try virgin coconut oil. Before meal and after meal in d night.
2657 2018-12-24 18:15:20 This methodology What Kant Diagonalising between the truth of deep future sins There's an older than world of oil.
2658 2018-12-24 18:15:18 They’re stuck between a rock and a hard place, for sure. The NEB process takes ages, and can’t respond to fast changing situations. Which is a shame because whatever you think of oil, pipelines are MUCH better than rail.
2659 2018-12-24 18:15:17 We need a moat and a wall with giant cauldrons we can use to pour hot oil on the invading armies.
2660 2018-12-24 18:15:14 Tbf just ignore the oil bit and you're set
2661 2018-12-24 18:15:11 live ink? If I remember correctly Gemini only does live oil and watercolor right?

ISIS was created and trained by CIA Directorate of Operations (Brennan thugs), funded by Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

2669 2018-12-24 18:14:27 Either the Clintons, who SA stopped paying, or the Russians who are trying to get a contract to build 4 nuclear power plants and submitted a bid after Kashhoggi's death against Bechtel, the US contractor who submitted a bid prior to his death. Turkey new oil drilling next day.

2671 2018-12-24 18:14:17 I rarely publicly comment on cannabis.

CBD oil took my crippling anxiety and made it manageable. I have a friend with worse anxiety (somehow) and CBD oil has had an incredibly positive experience.

At the very least I would try it.

2675 2018-12-24 18:13:53 Oil who said anything about oil?
2676 2018-12-24 18:13:46 Because Bernie is from Vermont and Beto is from Texas The largest oil producing state in the continental US.
2677 2018-12-24 18:13:38 One thing good abt shale oil is that it is more akin to tap on demand.. production capacity can go on or off depending on the price situation... still large debt pile of shale producers & its serviceability wud remain a big concern in event of sustained low oil prices.
2678 2018-12-24 18:13:35 OPEC has slashed Nigeria's oil production quota to 1.6 million barrels per day. This is far below the 2.3 million barrels per day assumed in the 2019 budget.

Buhari assumed an oil price benchmark of $60. Oil is currently $52.

This man is just clueless tbh. Recipe for failure.
2679 2018-12-24 18:13:18 2/3. Think of XRP as oil - any entity can discover it, "own" it, create products with it and then promote the products its created out of this native resource...
2680 2018-12-24 18:13:12 Well he’s not that far off. If you use butter milk and season them and let the bread soak up the butter milk and then pan fry them in a little bit of olive oil you get light and crispy croutons.
2681 2018-12-24 18:13:07 I’m thinking he’s a bot , and now he will be alone, Because George Bush senior took all trade secrets to the Damn grave!

2689 2018-12-24 18:12:32 Bad oil is bad but “containable”. Bad water (over 42 ppm oil and grease) will get you put in handcuffs. Your produced water goes overboard and the federal government frowns on oil in it.
2690 2018-12-24 18:12:31 You too uwu, I hope you get all the good things uwu, I got a smudge guard! I’m excited for my future tablet not to be covered in oil uwu
2691 2018-12-24 18:12:19 Declining oil prices track the expectation of a slump in global GDP growth, which will depress energy demand.
2692 2018-12-24 18:12:14 Not looking at oil.
2693 2018-12-24 18:12:14 People really have nothing better to do on Christmas Eve then getting an oil change, what a joke

2695 2018-12-24 18:12:03 #markets are collapsing after hours. #Crude oil wti attacks the $42 handle. $Spx down 3% to the worst December ever. There's blood on the streets. #OOTT
2696 2018-12-24 18:11:59 Yes, Restaurants should never serve bread before the meal. I don’t eat bread anymore anyway, And do enjoy a small salad before my meat or fish entree. I always bring my own olive oil
2697 2018-12-24 18:11:58 Fish oil broe, add fish oil.
2698 2018-12-24 18:11:57 How about this simple solution. The USPS spends BILLIONS a year in fuel. How about requiring the oil companies, who make billions in profits, to sell gas to the USPS at cost. It would save the USPS BILLIONS so they could make that ludicrous pre funding that GW signed off on #USPS

2702 2018-12-24 18:11:42 Obama’s supermajority was the Democrats’ big chance to show the world change.

Instead we got more servitude to Wall Street, to insurance (ACA), to oil (fracking boom), more war, and extension of Bush’s tax breaks for the rich.

Climate damage (DAPL), “free trade” (TPP), & more.

•Ban Oil, Gas, Fracking, Offshore Drilling, Coal, etc...

2711 2018-12-24 18:10:53 You mean from people who work for companies categorized as in the oil & gas industry—the largest employment sector in the state of Texas—It was 0.5% of the total $80 million he raised from individuals—no PACs—in his senate campaign.

2716 2018-12-24 18:10:10 Sand is a natural byproduct of the formation. But the chemicals you pump to process the oil and water itself create byproducts as well. This is what we call “pad”. It will fuck with your oil water interface and generally make for a bad day.

2721 2018-12-24 18:09:34 Most of their new conquests( outside of Indonesian oil) weren't worth much, didn't make the empire militarily stronger. Were a logistic drain.  I guess their plans for harnessing high-IQ Melanesians into the war effort ( as Science Guys) didn't have time to  bear fruit.

2724 2018-12-24 18:09:23 They are getting more of what they than ever, because they have a clown distracting the public. Grabs for public lands by oil companies? Funneling money to the

2731 2018-12-24 18:09:04 As you process oil for sale to the midstream. (Pipeline) you have to dry it. (Get it below 1% water, and sediment) that sediment has to go somewhere. It builds up in your process train and you have to get rid of it eventually.

2733 2018-12-24 18:08:35 Do your research. Look into Genie Oil and who sits on the board of this company that came out of us entering the Middle East. Research what the engineers and architects found when they examined the way towers fell. Research where 400 ton aircraft engines just “disappeared”.

2740 2018-12-24 18:07:27 So If a Big Oil Citizen buys a Politician its OK but its not when its a Big Oil PAC or Corp?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
2741 2018-12-24 18:07:26 And of course the smear about corporate donations  from oil when it consisted of donations from anyone employed in the oil and gas industry.  For a candidate in TX. Jesus
2742 2018-12-24 18:07:11 So I boiled my wig in conditioner and and oil last night and this mug is sooooooooooo soft . Nothing like soft curls/waves

2746 2018-12-24 18:07:04 I know what's not great you letting the Prince of Saudi Arabia kill a American journalist and get away with ir after the fact you found out everything that happened all because u wanted cheap oil no life is worth cheap oil and low gas prices your as guilty as he is for not doing

2749 2018-12-24 18:06:43 Get thee to a steam room. Or sit over a bowl of steaming water with a drop of eucalyptus oil.  But the steam room is better and several City rec centres have them.
2750 2018-12-24 18:06:39 @NinjaKitchen first time I’m using my blender to make frosting. My blender is squeaking. If I take the blender bowl off and rotate the drive mechanism, it squeaks. Is there a way to oil it or is it something else?
2751 2018-12-24 18:06:34 Today's laugh has to be people saying they won't listen to our station anymore because we published an article about B.C.'s oil and gas regulator blaming recent earthquakes on fracking. Because fake news is... publishing reports by official sources?
2752 2018-12-24 18:06:32 I really had to laugh watching Fox Business today. The recurring theme was that Steve Mnuchin and Trump's tweets were responsible for the market fall today. Please! The cause of all this is Jay Powell and the rest of the ivory tower bunch at the Fed. Inflation? With oil at $45?
2753 2018-12-24 18:06:31 #OIL $43.68 getting close to $40 dollars something’s going to have to give.
2754 2018-12-24 18:06:27 My new thing is CBD oil in my morning coffee
2755 2018-12-24 18:06:27 Well, my skin right right now is in shorting oil. So, I can't debate this, yet.

If I short gold, I'll tweet at you to match forecast.
2756 2018-12-24 18:06:22 Yeah, vegetable oil is generally a good one. That's what I get. Of course, I just throw the carrots in the oil raw as well.

2759 2018-12-24 18:06:13 Oooh, an olive oil butter mix perhaps?
2760 2018-12-24 18:06:12 Even if he didn't take money from big oil (sure were in a lot of maximum donations to him) he had a voting record of voting with big oil. So even if he isn't bought his record makes him unviable.
2761 2018-12-24 18:06:02 @karanbhasin95 can you help me to get the crude oil price for 2013 and now 2018 thanks.
2762 2018-12-24 18:05:50 I read a lot and pay attention to what is going on in the world. The Kurds in Syria live on very valuable oil reserves. Turkey wants it. They say they will eliminate the Kurds, who have helped us fight ISIS. I don’t like these endless wars, but just leaving will create a vacuum
2763 2018-12-24 18:05:41 Who if not Russians can solve they energy problem of Europe? They have already made one oil pipeline, let them to build another
2764 2018-12-24 18:05:40 Toast some Italian flavored bread crumbs in a little oil in a frying pan.
Spread on top as  you would cheese.
2765 2018-12-24 18:05:37 Fuck off, peppermint essential oil is the only thing keeping me going today, I caught the fucking stomach flu
2766 2018-12-24 18:05:22 When Trump said on day 1 that we should have kept the oil and maybe next time we will, I knew he didn’t respect the military.  To this day, his comment is lost on so many people.
2767 2018-12-24 18:05:06 Supply and bearish economic expectations. Too many people over estimate EV adoption and underestimate growth of oil consumption in Asia.
2768 2018-12-24 18:04:54 Oil change got my baby running so smooth.
2769 2018-12-24 18:04:53 LOL “Oil Change USA.” Also even that article admits he never took corporate or PAC money. Your dishonesty will backfire, buddy. Just go with the truth. It’s OK.
2770 2018-12-24 18:04:48 Try the sugar cookies on @seriouseats instead, the spread, texture, bake time etc for the snickerdoodles are all oil dependent.

2772 2018-12-24 18:04:16 Those are 15bbl cutting boxes. For sand, waste oil, etc. everything that comes offshore nowadays is pre slung now.
2773 2018-12-24 18:04:15 Good analogy but you can do the oil changes, tire change - minor fixes, before you take the car to the shop right? Same with yourself. You don’t wanna be completely broken needing to fix yourself then get into a relationship hoping they fix you & become your source of happiness
2774 2018-12-24 18:04:10 if you soak them in a ground clove of garlic and olive oil for 30 min daily it helps them grow back super quick and u can store the mixture in the fridge for a month! 
2775 2018-12-24 18:04:03 Some of the data is affected by the economy, the free market as you can see. But some part of it is affected by the culture specially what people eat. For example Italy and Spain have a Mediterranean culture which is good for health, based on olive oil for example.
2776 2018-12-24 18:04:00 Dear Dems: If you're upset now with people pointing out that one Dem accepted oil employee money and voted with Republicans a few times, then just wait.

2779 2018-12-24 18:03:36 9/11 was the cruel mass murder by the Deep State Cabal of thousands of Americans- all for the right to go into the Middle East to grab natural gas and oil. All dead for profit of NWO.

2781 2018-12-24 18:03:30 Pierre also did damage to here in western Canada with his policies and Justin is following up with his policies.   Like bill c-69, bill c-48 banning oil tankers from Alberta but nothing about the diesel barges moving up the bc coast to prince Rupert etc
2782 2018-12-24 18:03:25 He made a pledge not toaccept donations over $200 from execs in the oil industry. He broke that pledge. You’re the one misrepresenting that as irrelevant.
2783 2018-12-24 18:03:23 Whats the best oil out there for arthritis?
2784 2018-12-24 18:03:01 They are just goingb to put up the oil price & everyone will be paying for it you idiot.

2785 2018-12-24 18:02:53 I thought I was the only one. Do you know where can I get a good hair oil for tonight? Please, I have to do a heist at 10 pm and I have to look pretty!
2786 2018-12-24 18:02:51 Dollar yes, gold no.

If I had available cash, tied up to shorting oil right now, I'd short gold.

2789 2018-12-24 18:02:26 Personally I  want to know EVERYONE's record, Beto's personality is excellent, but I DO want to know if he is an environmentalist, for example. He is a Texan and oil is big there. I want to KNOW what he is about, not just vote with my heart alone. He seems great. time will tell.
2790 2018-12-24 18:02:20 Let me c/p this again, just to horrify u personally:

Teacher: does everyone have thier essay on the evolution of the oil industry 

Me: no but I could give you a detailed recap of everything that happened in season 2 of @marvelsrunaways
2797 2018-12-24 18:01:47 No oil.  At least @HomefuelsDirect called to confirm.  Would recommend heating oil customers avoid @HomefuelsDirect.  @FuelTool you should consider removing them from your supplier list. Christmas without heating it is!
2798 2018-12-24 18:01:47 boss i don’t need rice and oil as christmas gifts pls. give me money. there’s rice at home

2800 2018-12-24 18:01:38 Because without the US forces backing them up, the Kurds can’t realistically expect to retain control of the oil wells that they illegally seized
2801 2018-12-24 18:01:35 To heal a pimple quickly, apply tea tree oil on pimple every few hours, and apply vitamin E oil on the spot, about 1 hour before bedtime.
2802 2018-12-24 18:01:35 Correct, the oil embargo meant that Japan had to cave and quit China or go to war.

2811 2018-12-24 18:00:31 Beto took zero corporate or PAC money from oil companies. Individuals working in one of the largest industries in his home state of Texas donated. There is no need for this dishonesty. Stick to telling the truth, you’ll be fine.
2812 2018-12-24 18:00:29 With coconut oil, yeah. Fill a long look around. Let them kill me. Let them kill me.

2819 2018-12-24 17:59:50 I've been enjoying some very close shaves without nicks/cuts/irritation.

The secret?
- shave in the shower
- use shave oil in place of soap-based shave lubricants
2820 2018-12-24 17:59:50 Wrap them in pizza dough, bake them. Roast new potatoes with olive oil, sprinkle herbs over them. Decap wrapped baked cheeses, dip roast new potatoes in the cheese, munch.
2821 2018-12-24 17:59:45 Always seems to me that oil provides the biggest chance of owning something awkward - like a 4 mile long train in Texas or a tanker parked off the coast of Africa...
2822 2018-12-24 17:59:32 The straw ( in retrospect) may’ve been the fact almost none of that oil would make into E/Cndn autos. No refining capacity. Why would QC/ON & maritimes take the risk just for AB’s export market?
2823 2018-12-24 17:59:31 Roasted with Chinese Five Spice and a little oil, amazing!

2825 2018-12-24 17:59:24 Putting Rose oil in the essential oil diffuser is really frigging nice, it is so mellowing. Something I need after going ham on the office earlier.

2827 2018-12-24 17:59:09 Here’s my skin routine: African soap, coconut oil. Chakra or lavender oil. I don’t really like lotion unless it’s cocoa butter type of lotion and I prefer the organic kind not that watered down  that still makes you ashy. You’re welcome
2828 2018-12-24 17:59:03 Judging from the case of the "oil boys"..
2829 2018-12-24 17:59:02 How have I never used an oil wash before?! It's literally magic.
2830 2018-12-24 17:59:01 Stocks weren't supposed to. Need a positively divergent "lower low" first. Oil just following them down it seems. Prior low of 42.05 possible now.
2831 2018-12-24 17:59:00 握手する
2832 2018-12-24 17:59:00 I think we need a lower dollar, drawing inventory and US shale production destruction first, before oil prices can catch a bid. Though times
2833 2018-12-24 17:58:55 But he keeps saying we need #TMX and #KeystoneXL to ship oil to #China so basically another politician flip flopping on every issue............. UGH #cdnpoli #abpoli #ableg
2834 2018-12-24 17:58:42 Our grandparents must stop paying for 'miracles' - when u get older there's a reasonable expectation that u have learnt to sort thru the riff raff or taking a double pinch of salt when it comes to snake oil salesmen. 

I feel sorry for our gullible elders.
2835 2018-12-24 17:58:33 Coconut oil + Brown Sugar - Make it fresh every time and scrub every 3 days. Also avoid using vaseline for a lip balm and don't lick your lips, saliva makes them dry out more often. Once or twice per week. I like to do this before bed.
2836 2018-12-24 17:58:33 I had a company just send me@this CBD oil for my rheumatoid arthritis! Trying it out to see if I get more relief! #rheumie #ra #rheumatoid #arthritis

2840 2018-12-24 17:58:24 We lived in Calgary in the 80s. After the 1983 oil price crash people had bumper stickers that said "Please God, if you send me another oil boom I promise not to piss it all away this time." So soon forgotten.

2843 2018-12-24 17:58:15 Ahhh look at you being a Christian  and not lashing out at someone.  It just brings the country together like oil and water! Good will towards man.Except for this one..and that one....and the one over there....
2844 2018-12-24 17:58:14 Oh they have a taste all right!  Fresh are definitely better and you should always score a cross in the bottom of them.  I'm one of the few people who love them!

2853 2018-12-24 17:57:21 Yes na. Sometimes for more effect we would bath with the oil.
2854 2018-12-24 17:57:05 About the last point, other world powers (esp consumers like China) may share US interests, if that's what you mean.

That interest is in fragmented control leading to a market outcome, not protection.  Whoever has the oil needs to sell it, unless they get a partial monopoly.

2860 2018-12-24 17:56:20 I have never been ashamed of someone from my home state as much as I am right now.

We grew up thinking everyone was a friend we hadn't met yet, we opened our hearts & homes to strangers & loved & helped our neighbors.

Is this the result of the oil boom?

What changed in 20 yrs?

2863 2018-12-24 17:55:51 Sure! Make yourself a chicken stock by boiling a carcass

Meanwhile, cook up some diced onions, garlic and roasted green chiles with some butter and olive oil in a pot, nicely caramelizing them

Add the stock, simmer for an hour, then drop in chunks of chicken and add heavy cream

2866 2018-12-24 17:55:46 I disagree,  we hav a standard bible all over the world, might not hav bn the original,  only thru faith in God do we believe that the writers were inspired by the Holy Spirit,  ts not a book but the word of God, every being has a measure of faith,  the oil that keeps us moving.

2876 2018-12-24 17:54:27 Read the instructions folks. Don’t be stupid like this shows. Know how much oil should be in it (w/ turkey in it ahead of time; perhaps testing it w/water to see how much oil is needed for the turkey).  Don’t fill it with oil, then try to put in the turkey. Safety first.

2898 2018-12-24 17:53:16 Current price per barrel is steeply discounted due to all of the hassles of getting it to the destination. Rail being the biggest part of that.

Get our oil to tidewater and that changes as we would get world prices for our heavy oil.
2899 2018-12-24 17:53:12 I just tweeted this to another person so let me cp for ur horror: They legit just recced a recipe where u fry an egg sunny side up with coconut oil, and garnish it with turmeric and black pepper powder
2900 2018-12-24 17:53:11 I enjoy *good* (ie: not canned) mushrooms, but I don't understand why anyone likes fried mushrooms. All they do is absorb a buttload of oil, so when you bite into one, you get an explosion of scalding-hot grease in your mouth.
2901 2018-12-24 17:53:11 E&P has survived with less than 50$. Service industry has not picked up since then. The lucrative jobs and attraction of oil industry has vanished and it will never come back I speculate?

2904 2018-12-24 17:53:00 I actually think this goose fat trend is a bit of a nonsense (a bit nasty tasting). I've saved up the fat from previous roast pork, roast duck dishes, put in a little cup, refrigerate and use when required. But actually if I've found myself without any 'fat', I have coconut oil..
2905 2018-12-24 17:52:53 I’m sure. They would love to have more control over the entire Middle East and it’s oil reserves. Oh...you thought they would just keep listening to you once the military isn’t there?  Silly boy. They “Trixed” you again.

2917 2018-12-24 17:52:00 Of course not. Oil below $50 per barrel.  Must be the summer driving season (whatever that is anymore), the winter heating season, a relatively temporary production slow down, a glut of supply, or a shortage of supply. Slightest rumours, gas prices up instantly.

2927 2018-12-24 17:51:15 When you anoint yourself with oil
2928 2018-12-24 17:51:14 Show me. I’ve seen a lot of evidence supporting it and none disproving it. And 97% of scientists are not likely to believe something disproven. Every time someone points me to a paper “disproving” it, there’s no real evidence and it turns out to be funded by big oil.

2931 2018-12-24 17:51:05 #Oil prices still plunging. All year I have warned about big oil glut. OPEC will break up resulting in drastic price cutting to attract buyers. II warned that rally this year and inventory statistics were highly manipulated to allow W.S. insiders to dump into the rally.

2933 2018-12-24 17:50:52 akalain mo yon, naka button up akong white kanina sa church then nag color naman ako using oil pastel pag-uwi
2934 2018-12-24 17:50:47 No it also comes from lies re “oil $” to Beto. Employees of oil industry are many in TX; they gave to Beto. Corporations didn’t. Yet Berners keep saying it’s so.
2935 2018-12-24 17:50:46 Correct me if I’m wrong but don’t they raise interest rates in an effort to stem inflation ? More importantly has that ever worked before, for me raising rates is like kick starting an engine but your motor has no oil and it’s beginning to smoke, take the economy into the shop !
2936 2018-12-24 17:50:30 I think it was a goal of his to increase production at home and be less reliant on Middle Eastern oil. Without oil today, right now at this moment, civilization would collapse.
2937 2018-12-24 17:50:06 Hey Einstein, the Saudis are just going to add a few dollars to the per barrel price we pay for oil, to make us pay for rebuild. Are you really too  dense to see that?

2940 2018-12-24 17:49:42 Many Boatmen will give up on their lives by jumping from this bridge. Modi govt always planning to kill poors.

2978 2018-12-24 17:47:12 As long as people want the latest iDevice, enjoy flying to fun places for vacation, or similar - there will always be a demand.

Eastern Canada imports oil from the Saudis instead of souring it domestically. Now our govt is actively trying start a fight with them.

Bewildering.
2979 2018-12-24 17:47:11 The wall could have gas jets that ignite when people are trying to breach it and burns them alive!  There is the added benefit of big bucks to big oil for the fuel!

2990 2018-12-24 17:46:17 Lol, hey if ya wanna go live like you were in the stone age, go right ahead. 
Just be sure to give all tech that has been made possible due to oil and gas.
2991 2018-12-24 17:46:12 Check your Engine oil this morning.
2992 2018-12-24 17:46:10 Good for you Alberta. While Quebec has been building itself up with surpluses they have been destroying  the oil industry in the west and auto industry in Canada. We can't let Quebec destroy this great country.
2993 2018-12-24 17:45:59 Ayo, why don’t you go juggle some chainsaws blindfolded on a tarmac of baby oil.... you absolute shit pouch.
2994 2018-12-24 17:45:41 of course you realize Syria will become part of Saudi arabia when or if they start spending money . do you realize by pulling troops out if Syria and Afghanistan you turn over the middle East to Russia and Saudi Arabia and they have all the oil?
2995 2018-12-24 17:45:31 This is not the entire truth. Saudi wants their oil. They could care less about anything else. How much of a kick back are you getting from Russia, Turkey and Saudi?
2996 2018-12-24 17:45:31 @adsteel rehashing Fed news is getting old. Today you hit upon a good topic ...Did the markets take down oil or did oil take down the markets...  If the latter, whose partially fake sanctions might have taken down oil.  Is shale patch growth trajectory still on target?
2997 2018-12-24 17:45:24 He's also pushing for more oil production. Conservation isn't going to solve climate change, you're giving him credit for putting a bandaid on a missing limb

3000 2018-12-24 17:45:17 It’s cause people don’t always get the correct CBD oil THEY need. Everyone is different and there’s different types of CBD oil too. There’s some more potent than others and there’s some specifically for anxiety AND depression.

I miss the ignorance of childhood.

3005 2018-12-24 17:44:38 Read the IPCC report Shaun, then understand why having another president beholden to big oil will lead to ecological disaster. Time’s running out, drastic times don’t call for centrist solutions.
3006 2018-12-24 17:44:34 I’ve only been home for a day and I already smell like every essential oil known to man
3007 2018-12-24 17:44:32 Thoughts on oil? Starting to look like a buy at $44 a barrel.
3008 2018-12-24 17:44:24 Was thinking how in the middle ages, people didn't shower. All that oil build up, clogged pores and oily faces and bodies. Oh, Lord!
3009 2018-12-24 17:44:19 lets burn the midnight oil
3010 2018-12-24 17:44:18 Yeah, which is why Beto is not even close to acceptable. He refuses to support #MedicareForAll #FreeCollege or a #GreenNewDeal he even said the choice between oil and natural gas was a false choice. Both are just awesome! He's a Republican.
3011 2018-12-24 17:43:58 I’ve also suffered my whole life with psoriasis and none of them work!! “Oregon grape” tea is the only thing that has ever made a difference and I felt good about taking a natural remedy. I’m now considering CBD oil.
3012 2018-12-24 17:43:51 My daily diet: compartments 3 & 2, less 1 & 4 (less grains / when then mostly whole grains, less meat, more fish & eggs), 5 - olive oil only and 6 very rarely; and lots of strong coffee  drink fresh water daily... Besides quality sleep, less stress, running & muscles work-outs!
3013 2018-12-24 17:43:47 3- It wasn't until the industrial revolution that paints became accessible to the general population. Before that they were made by the artists from powdered minerals and oil and they keep "recipes" to themselves.
3014 2018-12-24 17:43:36 My mum just received a human sized sack of rice, a gallon of oil and two yams from one of her students. She shouted me downstairs like she had just won the lottery. How am I supposed to compete with that.

3018 2018-12-24 17:43:28 Why have you stopped talking about the falling oil prices. You were pained maximum when it was rising. But u don't seem to be enjoying it when it's falling.

3022 2018-12-24 17:43:22 Toby, all I can say enough people were telling you, there was no way another country would build a stupied wall. Trump is a con man, snake oil salesman, distorts reality for his plateform. But I will tell you do not expect to see money  any big money from taxes, not happening
3023 2018-12-24 17:43:17 Do you milk, nutritional yeast, olive oil/coconut oil, & apple cider vinegar?
3024 2018-12-24 17:42:57 That’s why the free Syrian armies lands, when taken back by the SAA always has boatloads of American and Israeli arms and supply shipments right? That’s why the FSA and SDF happily let the us build dozens of military bases on Syria’s most oil rich territory?
3025 2018-12-24 17:42:48 I got my mom Organic Hemp Oil and she applies it to her areas that are affected and she takes a small spoonful once a day and her psoriasis is barely noticeable. She also says it helps with her RA. One bottle has lasted her almost two years as well which is pretty cool.

3030 2018-12-24 17:42:28 What could we have expected? She’s daddy’s girl. The apple didn’t fall far from the snake oil tree.
3031 2018-12-24 17:42:21 There’s something about a ham cheese sandwich with lettuce, tomato onions, mayo, salt,pepper, oil & vinegar with a side of lays potato chips and a crispy ass Pepsi that just HITS the spot. 
3032 2018-12-24 17:42:17 I've a feeling that somehow the frequent shut-down of the US government, the trade war, decline in crude oil prices and the slide in Dow Jones indicate that we'd still be in unfamiliar and uncertain teritory in 2019 just as we were in 2018.

3053 2018-12-24 17:40:49 As I was lazy with no intentions to leave the house, casually scheming through the fridge I found the Indian recipe hair oil, and decided to use it. A few hours later, I decided to use the organic argan oil I’ve had for 5 years. Whilst I’m at it, I’ve put two masks on my face

3056 2018-12-24 17:40:44 Under the condition that a state there declared war on/attacked the US, basically.

Other tools of foreign policy should be used to keep any one state or alliance from monopolizing control of oil. Which should not be a difficult goal.
3057 2018-12-24 17:40:44 Like I said Oil is shit Gill.  Your argument discredits the 150000 years that humans have been existing here on earth.  How was that possible without your precious?  responsible extraction does not exist in our society.

3071 2018-12-24 17:39:26 Yes, green energy is a type of diversification; but anything green is still driven by the oil and gas industry. Even solar panels or wind turbines need gas fired furnaces to manufacture the products that claim green. Economic feasibility will never occur on a grand scale 4 years

3080 2018-12-24 17:38:20 For ex. I’d do an oil change in my driveway for $15, you’d be paying around $30 for oil and filter. That’s $45 if you buy the oil, same thing as in a shop. Difference is you’re paying $45 more to a shop than what I’d charge to do it in my driveway. $90 at a shop, $45-$50 at home.
3081 2018-12-24 17:38:18 Fellas for 2019, we making the ladies happy. After she had a long day. Get yourself some oil, sit her down, place her legs across ur lap and give her a nice foot massage. Gossip with and then give her a kiss on her forehead.

3083 2018-12-24 17:38:15 Mr. President I agree they should help their neighbor. Why are we sending money to South America and Mexico? Mexico is oil rich ?  One of the top 4 wealthiest countries in the Western Hemisphere . Why are we subsidizing Mexico !??

3085 2018-12-24 17:37:53 So what about the oil cars and the train network that crosses the country. Or at least use too before everyone decided that it was easier to ship things using less efficient transports  trucks.
3086 2018-12-24 17:37:47 That's when you get an essential oil diffuser and just fill it up with water.

3114 2018-12-24 17:35:02 My liberal, Bush hating, "no war for oil", anti-military peacenik Mom giving complicated reasons why pulling out of Syria is a bad idea.
3115 2018-12-24 17:34:52 So many moments in that movie are burned into my brain, but at the end when they're struggling for their lives and the SEA IS ON FIRE and there's oil and smoke everywhere--young me full-on panicked.

3119 2018-12-24 17:34:29 I use liberal amounts of palm oil when I mastur....oh.  I've said too much.
3120 2018-12-24 17:34:21 Those are from individual donors who work in those industries. If someone who works there donates they will be listed, it's not the same as receiving money from an oil company. This is exactly the stupidity the Russians/Trumpers use. Let's not use it please.
3121 2018-12-24 17:34:19 Cheaper gas prices should be available soon. Oil is down.
3122 2018-12-24 17:34:18 @MedvedevRussiaE  Mr. Medvedev - Linkedin profile - Joseph Plischke.  I have a huge U.S. West Coast Crude Oil Terminal project/partnership. Up to 5 million bbls of light crude can be exported monthly.  Contact me on Linkedin.  @joeyyeo13 / Joseph Plischke
3123 2018-12-24 17:34:08 They built a nation not just a province on the expected revenue of oil & gas. I’m looking forward to the day the taps shut off. Not because I’m an environmentalist but because I want to see them eat their cake while trying to keep it too.
3124 2018-12-24 17:33:52 Man, Prager "University" isn't a university and it's overtly conservative. They're shamelessly promoting oligarchy's propaganda.
Venezuela has become a "dictatorship" when they've nationalized the oil and  Exxon, ConocoPhillips, Chevron and Total lost the ability to exploit it.

3126 2018-12-24 17:33:41 Paid for buy US buying oil and other payments to SA that they transfer to whom in Syria? Allies or Assad, @realDonaldTrump 
Kind of like SA is saying "US will pay to rebuild what they destroyed in Syria."
3127 2018-12-24 17:33:37 That’s why I love that my homies and I use count oil and mix raw distillate in it so I know exactly what I’m smoking on
3128 2018-12-24 17:33:29 Jesse, without the shale bubble, oil prices would be much higher than they are now. Shale has provided the only production growth the last sevearl years. If shale crashes, oil prices will spike. Banks and investors will lend to shale again if prices spike, so we rinse and repeat.
3129 2018-12-24 17:33:15 Snake oil salesmen have just changed the ingredients to the snake oil
3130 2018-12-24 17:33:09 And after the Turks exterminate the Kurds Assad gets his oil production back so he can pay Putin for all the protection. Sounds like Putin, MBS, Erdogon come out winners and Trump gets hotels in Moscow, Istanbul and Riyad. Has SA paid us for the fuel and air support in Yemen?
3131 2018-12-24 17:33:05 Sana oil
3132 2018-12-24 17:32:46 Oil needs to $10 so it is free
3133 2018-12-24 17:32:44 Yes, remember the high 5 with Putin? They pushed you out and now of course they’ll work with Putin to own the ports and straights and control the oil flow. They’ll rebuild now because they own it! They made a deal and you don’t even get it, yet! Saudi A plays hard. So does Putin
3134 2018-12-24 17:32:40 We don't really understand that bedrock of economics being management and allocation with an eye on scarity, sometimes I think this oil we've got is one of our biggest problems, people don't realize that wells dry up after some years of drilling
3135 2018-12-24 17:32:37 I hate olives too, but I love olive oil. Go figure!

3137 2018-12-24 17:32:29 Beto doesn't stroke me as an evil man. However, that won't save the people most imposed by climate change is his relationship with big oil prevents him from making the radical change that's needed. His record suggests that it would. That's disqualifying.
3138 2018-12-24 17:32:29 I be feeling bad because service stores be ripping people off.  Most of the time the oil changes, tire changes or other maintenance is really not the pricing they charge. They over charge and I know because I do the work.

3142 2018-12-24 17:32:21 There have never been any agreements on paying compensation to Belarus in connection with the tax manoeuvre in Russia's oil and gas industry. The only agreement was to discuss this issue

3155 2018-12-24 17:31:38 2018 was hard I won't lie, can't even start counting the many misfortunes, It was hard to believe in God. I believed God failed me. 
One thing I have come to understand is that for mourning he will give you the oil of gladness. God's timing is never late he shows up right on time

3159 2018-12-24 17:31:31 What is the US supposed to do? Sanction our biggest OPEC partner? The only thing keeping the US dollar afloat is the fact countries have to buy oil in USD. If that disappears our economy collapses along with the rest of the west.
3160 2018-12-24 17:31:30 i found oil man
3161 2018-12-24 17:31:25 お久しぶりです
3162 2018-12-24 17:31:23 why do you do this to yourself
3163 2018-12-24 17:31:20 Crude oil and gas companies may never recover. We're heading into times of increased supply and reduced demand, which doesn't bode well for the sector. Wouldn't be surprised to see Exxon acting like Philip Morris in 25 years -- paying out massive dividends while earnings dwindle.
3164 2018-12-24 17:31:10 There are two widows in my street my mom always give rice, tomatoes paste and V. oil to every Christmas, now FG didn't even pay salary 
3165 2018-12-24 17:31:07 Oh forgot another natural supplement before big games and work outs is Short chain fatty acids Organic Coconut oil give fast energy and lubricates the brain, so administer all three after possible head injury! Green tea capsaisin spinach and Organic coconut oil! All Organic*
3166 2018-12-24 17:31:03 Bullshit. Saudi needs oil at $75 just to break even on their domestic spending.

3172 2018-12-24 17:30:34 @KThompson_WCVB Great noon newscast Katie.
Even oil is tumbling down like the stock market.
The drop has been sharp since September 30th when it was $75.02 per barrel.
Now it is trading at $44.33 per barrel.
Heating prices still haven't budge. It is $2.80 per gallon back home.
3173 2018-12-24 17:30:28 You know I don’t advocate total socialism, and even so an economy portfolio that consists of 95% oil is hardly a representative example...
3174 2018-12-24 17:30:28 $xom is at the same level it is now as it was 13 years ago. It's not just a shale thing, Big Oil disregards profits for growth time and again.

3178 2018-12-24 17:30:22 Well, perhaps they want to prop up Denis Sassou Nguesso whose country was bailout 8 years ago by @IMFNews ,but is now bankrupt by a combination of corruption & fall in  oil price which is the mainstay of the oil rich but poor West African country
3179 2018-12-24 17:30:20 repeat after me! SEX!!!!
3180 2018-12-24 17:30:13 With the price of oil dropping more than 40% since October due to all the Iran waivers you shocked them with, Saudi Arabia’s priorities are going to be on how to balance a national budget with Brent oil now at $52.25. They need $85-90.
3181 2018-12-24 17:30:10 When the things you vote for are killing our planet and harming workers its not a good thing. It would be one thing if he was voting with someone like Rand Paul against overreach or imperialism, its another to vote for oil companies and against immigrants.
3182 2018-12-24 17:30:10 His blog + his votes are my fact check. He is not pro oil, he did not vote for TPP, he voted against volcker rule

3190 2018-12-24 17:29:18 Mr. President - Saudi Arabia has no money.  Have you seen the price of a barrel of oil?  They are no longer wealthy.

3194 2018-12-24 17:28:46 Not enough room to fully respond, but the tax cuts are broader than just the rich and the impact is, in many ways, universal.  I am directly involved in the oil business and I can tell you that for 8 years the government did all they could to shut it down.

3202 2018-12-24 17:28:07 Yea yea. All the months of low oil during the Obama admin and the Fracking is what kept the economy strong 
3203 2018-12-24 17:28:05 Now they don’t need the gulf of Oman or the Persian Gulf to ship oil through the Medeterranian.

3224 2018-12-24 17:26:18 The rich have been waging wars killing missionaries and christians in pursuit of their oil, LNG, pipelines and war profits.

3234 2018-12-24 17:25:42 So in my former WS career opinion I like BPT $17, because oil won’t be down forever and it got pummeled in the past 2 months. Huge dividend while u wait but keep in mind it’s a royalty trust with a finite termination date. Current model has 2028 so do some math before u buy it.

3265 2018-12-24 17:23:18 It's such a bloody tenuous miracle. Transparently we're celebrating a successful guerrilla war/insurgency/terrorist campaign and it's been dressed up with this oil bollocks. I wonder what the contemporary feelings were.
3266 2018-12-24 17:23:17 Yes thank you fauxpo the aho... My friend is in yemen and hasnt had clean water in years and has watched hundreds of children die because of USa bombing them, oil is spoil.
3267 2018-12-24 17:23:16 This is fair. Though I will say, for Beto specifically, his record and relationship to oil is as recent as his last campaign. If there is one area that brokers *no* compromise from my perspective, it's the climate. The 2020 nominee can have *no* relationship with those companies.

His tax cut created boom bust conditions; his Iran/Venezuela sanctions created specific boom-bust conditions in the highly leveraged oil complex.

3276 2018-12-24 17:22:24 Did you glean out how many of them are small donors who simply work in oil and gas? In Barrasso's case, while he did have a lot of PAC funding (oil, natgas, pharma) he had hundreds of small donors as well, many of whom just happened to work in the state's largest industry.

3284 2018-12-24 17:21:31 Maybe they are concerned that with the advancement of good batteries,  solar power, electric engines it will cut into the profits of the oil industry?

3288 2018-12-24 17:21:01 He rebuilt our military and destroyed the ISIS califate. Got us off foreign oil dependance.  Reduced our taxes. Brought us jobs and conservative judges. Renegotiating trade. The platform he was elected on has not changed.
3289 2018-12-24 17:20:56 Festive Christmas Eve times - realizing I'm almost out of heating oil. Call for delivery. Debit card is cracked. Call for replacement. Do one load of laundry but leave heat set pretty low. Inventory sweaters ...
3290 2018-12-24 17:20:55 I agree that the oil collapse is overdone. The market is over-supplied, but not to this extent. If I had cash to spare, I think it is a very reasonable trade, assuming you can hold for >1 month. And of course, keep your initial position size small.

We are ( running ) ( short ) ( of ) oil.
3293 2018-12-24 17:20:33 This is correct. Beto could easily say tomorrow that he supports the Green New Deal. Were he elected to office, he will become Obama2 bragging about how much oil he extracted from under the ground during his administration.

3303 2018-12-24 17:20:05 Your analysis is spot on. Trumps Ace in the hole- Texas! USA now produces more oil than Saudi Arabia. Oil wars are ending soon along with currency restructuring. New paradigm coming - Love not Hate -Peace
3304 2018-12-24 17:20:03 International crude oil rates were less compared to upa all these 4 years but the oil prices were more than their term. Anyway welcome this

3311 2018-12-24 17:19:40 I got it wrong too.  But the bigger picture is Gov'ts are not supporting big oil anymore.  That matters.  Oil feels like Coal in the Obama gov't.
3312 2018-12-24 17:19:35 The best Christmas present I asked for from Kevin was to get my oil changed in my car

3314 2018-12-24 17:19:15 @MrsdogC I wanted to see if you were trying the Rick Simpson Oil as a treatment option? It works miracles. Merry Christmas to you and your family. I’m praying for you.
3315 2018-12-24 17:19:13 . Aside all the oil money, you want to send all your top players there? Haha. Wont be surprised you're the same type that'll cry about rich getting richer

3321 2018-12-24 17:18:35 Today was the perfect day to get my oil changed, I was in and out. 
3322 2018-12-24 17:18:33 2 of 2

They also stated we were all going to die due to catastrophic Global Cooling.

Now? So much oil stocks hit the toilet and Man-made Climate Change (a.k.a. Global Warming) is undisputed fact.

And WE are belittled for doubting.
3323 2018-12-24 17:18:09 Agree we have a market perception issue. Electric vehicles are going to take over, oil is going to zero, shale is going to pump to infinity. Markets continue like this, everyone is dead wrong and needs to recalibrate how they view asset classes
3324 2018-12-24 17:18:02 oil and energy? i wont even look at it
3325 2018-12-24 17:17:58 We’ll forgive the guys in the oil patch for thinking that they are.
3326 2018-12-24 17:17:51 I'm down to my last free oil change. (Well not free cuz i paid for the service plan but yeah).

3332 2018-12-24 17:17:29 cbd oil and ginger ale ultimately have the same effect
3333 2018-12-24 17:17:27 Well oil producing nations struggle economically & remained underdeveloped for many reasons like;
Corruption by Politicians,
Looting of nations wealth by Politicians,
Lack of wealth distribution
Insecurity & poverty
Financial discrimination
Social discrimination
Greed by Rulers.
3334 2018-12-24 17:17:18 Partnering with a country that bought oil  under the table from ISIS is an horrible idea sir

3337 2018-12-24 17:17:12 It’s Christmas. I smell oil and grease coming from my kitchen.
3338 2018-12-24 17:17:06 Eating chicken noodle soup I put cbd oil in to help me get over my cold and to help me get over time with my family later
3339 2018-12-24 17:17:02 Invest in good moisturizing products, a denman brush, hot oil treatments and deep condition religiously. You’ll notice a difference
3340 2018-12-24 17:16:53 Hasn't he also supported wind and solar?  He's from an oil state, so I would expect him to have supported their interest to some degree.  I don't believe he is in bed with oil companies though.
3341 2018-12-24 17:16:50 Crude oil dropped another 2.5% on Monday after plunged over 11% last week to $45/bbl,capping its biggest weekly decline since 2016.
3342 2018-12-24 17:16:50 It's an interesting dynamic.  AT $52/bbl Brent and with potential relief from a lowering dollar (through deceleration in interest rate hikes), demand could be spurred vs the alternative. With oil prices where they are, the downside risk on the demand front seems lower.
3343 2018-12-24 17:16:29 (´・ω・`) お辛い
3344 2018-12-24 17:16:21 I think that’s where I went wrong. I should’ve tossed the Brussels sprouts after baking in olive oil. Thanks, will try. Do you season it with any salt, pepper? Or is the balsamic enough?
3345 2018-12-24 17:16:17 @CelsiusEnergyFM what are your thoughts on shorting DWT here?  This oil collapse seems fairly manufactured and not demand driven
3346 2018-12-24 17:16:11 Bull Crap..you must be a big Oil investor.

You basically cleanse your face with organic non comedogenic oils and essential oils (based on what problems you want to combat)
that are rich in vitamins & minerals to regulate your natural oil production and prevent breakouts.
Look it up on YouTube!

3356 2018-12-24 17:15:18 ... alternatively I can sell you some CBD oil to calm things down...
3357 2018-12-24 17:15:09 1 of 2

From a Nov. newsletter: "Plummeting oil prices were one of the biggest drivers behind the market’s losses, as investors worried that too much oil is available."

Remember the '70s when we had a gas shortage? Lines. Rationing. Scientists stated we'd run out by 1991.
3358 2018-12-24 17:15:09 Tip: When you're next at the supermarket get some coconut flour, coconut oil and Almond flour - these are great to have in your cupboard to make #Keto friendly breads and cakes!
3359 2018-12-24 17:15:05 I don't know as guilting is necessary but spreading information is. If people don't know that the production of Palm oil is creating this type of destruction and it is included in these products how are consumers going to be able to choose ethically sourced goods?
3360 2018-12-24 17:15:05 We are also subsidizing the VERY rich oil companies. They're taking advantage of us too.
3361 2018-12-24 17:14:54 My gma really sending me out in this madness for some baby oil
3362 2018-12-24 17:14:52 No wonder you have so many failed biz & bks. No such thing as a necessary trade war and when the dollar is too strong, we can't sell our goods overseas. You've also screamed about oil prices and wonder what happens when oil stocks tank. 3rd shutdown, 2 years. #TrumpResign
3363 2018-12-24 17:14:52 Actually there's an oil boom in USA. They're doing what Alberta should have done----- diversify!

3366 2018-12-24 17:14:41 Can I expect the oil I paid for by 6pm?  Or just a call?
3367 2018-12-24 17:14:35 Stocks fluctuate, a lot of factors come into play.
Demand for oil in India could drop, shiping companies with tankers would go down and the POTUS would take the blame because of a trade dispute.
My stocks are doing better since i stopped listening to people with blue checkmarks.
3368 2018-12-24 17:14:16 we care because beto is the #2 oil and gas money recipient in all of congress, and the future of humanity quite literally hangs on whether or not our politicians will be beholden to big oil in the next 12-15 years

3372 2018-12-24 17:13:50 She’s feigning ignorance whilst commenting on the faux controversy stirred up by donut twitter that Beto received contributions from oil industry “employees”. That’s a big tell. Try harder.
3373 2018-12-24 17:13:44 Nehru  happily wrote three books from Almora jail whereas Veer Savarkar churned oil from coconuts for 27 years in Kalapani in Andaman Islands a living Hell on earth
3374 2018-12-24 17:13:43 Have they tested the ceiling & paint for any smoke or soot from torches & oil lamps?

Why does painted hieroglyphics that are thousands of years old look cleaner & have brighter colors?

Why does Renaissance paintings need deep cleaning after only a few hundred years?
3375 2018-12-24 17:13:33 For republican far right senators, this is true. But being productive on issues like  a tax cut For the rich, though unfunded. Or opening protected lands for oil exploration even though the united states is already producing record amounts of oil isn't a good thing.
3376 2018-12-24 17:13:32 Oil and steel are the wrong place now.  Absent an infrastructure bill which is sure hard to see happening.
3377 2018-12-24 17:13:31 Beto couldnt beat the weird Canadian goblin Ted Cruz, takes hundreds of thousands of dollars from oil & gas companies, and frequently votes conservative. If declaring my political opinion equals waging war, then hell I'm a vet
3378 2018-12-24 17:13:31 The claim that he was the 2nd largest recipient of oil and gas money was highly misleading, since it was an index of contributors by their employers' sector, not corporate donations. Same figure showed he was in the pocket of "retired" sector money.

3380 2018-12-24 17:13:07 $CHK at $1.78 and the insiders were buying up millions at $2.22.  This looks interesting, even in the current state of oil.
3381 2018-12-24 17:13:06 Block all the O & G coming to Alberta from Northern BC as we have not got room for it in the pipelines. BC will then be forced to build pipelines to the coast. We cut production in Alberta but not from Northern BC. Turn the tap off to BC Oil & Gas. Immediately.

3390 2018-12-24 17:12:39 Why don't we start in Vancouver. There's more emissions emitted from that ocean port city then in northern Alberta. At least Northern Alberta is cleaning up oil that is naturally collected in the sands. You're in denial. 99% your life is carbon & oil based 1% stupidity!

BJP govt under PM Modi has inaugurated the Paradip Oil Refinery & laid the foundation of Paradip- Hyderabad pipeline of Indian Oil Corp which will not only strengthen Odisha’s energy sector but will also boost employment & investment in the region
3411 2018-12-24 17:10:29 And if we're to speculate further: 
• The South and the oil fields will probably be given to Assad/Russia - and maybe further outsourcing the ISIS problem to them.
• The middle may get Tall Rifaat'ized.
• The north will follow the Euphrates Shield template.

3424 2018-12-24 17:09:12 Trump ain’t done nothing but deregulate all the over regulation that Obama did to get the oil boom going like the Keystone Pipeline that he shutdown! Those jobs pay the big bucks! But now Obama is trying to take credit for that! Come on now! We know better than that! Just chill.

3436 2018-12-24 17:08:28 Exactly, they have been fighting since the dawn of time, and will continue long after we’re gone.  Oil and big money contracts have kept us there.  They have lined their pockets with the blood of our children.

3439 2018-12-24 17:08:14 Lol You really have no idea how the business of oil and gas works. Arguing against CEE or deep drilling credits? That’s a pretty weak attempt at painting E&P’s, the most capital intensive sector out there as rent seekers. Go read another CBC article

of course they do, it would be career suicide otherwise. that said I'd rather Beto stay home and work for Texas than run for POTUS.

3479 2018-12-24 17:04:51 Weak AF?  Also: realistic. If I had a magic wand I’d get rid of oil and coal. No such wand exists. Beto reps a TX constituency, and is vocal about wanting to switch to renewables. It may not be enough for you, fair enough; it is for me.

3487 2018-12-24 17:03:44 Yes. I don’t want to make light of how China treats labor but slavery isn’t the reason we don’t have good trains. Conservatives funded by oil men have attacked and blocked mass transit projects for decades. They want us all in cars burning gas.

3495 2018-12-24 17:03:23 Reserve some of the pasta water just before you drain the pasta. It’s very starchy then and blends right into the oil. Add it in close to the pan, not from up high.

3502 2018-12-24 17:02:30 conservative's claim they love low gas prices & create them by policy but they wont acknowlege that the stock market thrives on high oil prices, like they dont believe oil & gas are related...just like last time gas under $2 a gallon oil at $40 a barrel & a CRASHING ECONOMY
3503 2018-12-24 17:02:29 I know someone who has used oil in her pup's food for anxiety. Worth a try!
3504 2018-12-24 17:02:24 Trump inherited a robust and growing economy from Obama. Out of stupidity and spite, he's managed to destroy it.

Like he was given a perfectly running car & decided to drain the oil, let the air out of the tires, and gun it down the freeway in the wrong lanes against traffic.

3510 2018-12-24 17:01:45 Turkey is a NATO allie.
The Kurds are not. They are allies of convenience. They took advantage of the chaos created by the insurgents to illegally seize control of Syria’s best oil wells. They should give them back & play nice with Assad, if they want protection from Erdogan

3525 2018-12-24 17:00:06 You gonna rebrand oil as "clean oil" like coal companies tried with "clean coal"?
3526 2018-12-24 17:00:01 Lovely Christmas Eve walk along the shoreline of the Cromarty Firth. The oil rigs that are located there for maintenance work , make an unusual/welcome site with their christmas trees lit up at night. 

3527 2018-12-24 16:59:52 Question is if they’ll wait for $30 oil again...

3529 2018-12-24 16:59:37 Sure it is if what your pitching will be a value at lower oil prices.
3530 2018-12-24 16:59:22 Digiornio pizzeria style supreme. Thin crust preferably. Put some olive oil on whatever surface you are using to bake it on. Make sure you monitor closely because it will be ready faster than the standard ones

3535 2018-12-24 16:58:48 Just a straight S&P ETF is good enough. but personally I like $ALL and $T. $BP I've been holding since the oil spill and I still like it.  $INTC also great.
3536 2018-12-24 16:58:38 Why are sad little oil city shippers still salty iris spilt the tea on Oliver's dirty ass? Why are they shitting on westallen? Y'all really that threatened by an actually healthy couple?
3537 2018-12-24 16:58:13 This is ignoring how one does not physically try to breath the gas as your lungs cant process it and your sinuses will become coated in the oil.

3543 2018-12-24 16:57:38 Preventing climate disaster means understanding that the Texas liberal shuns oil the way the organic Iowa farmer pooh-poohs ethanol.

All politics is local.

Bash Beto on oil, be ready to bash Bernie on guns.
3544 2018-12-24 16:57:37 Trump allies view his policies as economic tribalism of a snake  oil  salesman, he has  no policies, no plan and no process other than  that of a game show host.

3549 2018-12-24 16:57:16 How do you figure d?  Because of US domestic production?  We never imported much Middle East oil, so that was never the reason.

World market prices are still affected by Middle East production.  That doesn't make establishment policy rational, but it does make the ME significant
3550 2018-12-24 16:57:08 I see that David Sirota piece did exactly what it was meant to do. Confuse people and muddy the waters. 

When you donate to a campaign, it asks you to list your occupation.

Those oil and gas donations came from people that worked in that industry, not big oil itself.
3551 2018-12-24 16:57:04 I am very good at math. When the economy is booming ,unemployment lowest,business is expanding,coal,oil, etc. The Fed chief says we need to keep raising interest rates to throttle the economy. Really! Explain it.

3554 2018-12-24 16:56:48 This reminds me of when coal dumped. I was buying naked puts every day and making a killing. I dont know if i'm that brave with oil tho.

Bottom line, I'll vote for whoever the Dem candidate is. We can't gamble. I WILL still write him/call him out of oil and gas funding because Climate is number uno of many causes I care about.
3565 2018-12-24 16:55:47 Beto is a tool of the ruling class/

and his supporters demand we gve im a pass
3566 2018-12-24 16:55:32 Actually, Quebec is subsidized more at $11B compared to oils $3.3B. And, oil returns a $170B to GDP, so that is a great ROI - $5100%!! Foolish not to make that investment.
3567 2018-12-24 16:55:31 So @realDonaldTrump is able to magically turn the worst neo-Marxist adherents to the No-Blood-for-Oil, Stop-the-Endless-Wars club overnight into raging bloodthirsty neocons!

Is there anything this amazing President ism not capable of?

3587 2018-12-24 16:54:11 Countries need oil and agriculture to operate. They don't need to livestream twerk videos. It's  obvious why one industry would be monetarily supported over another.

3614 2018-12-24 16:51:32 This Syria pullout has DEEPER meaning.

Trump pulling out of Syria also means
He is pulling America out the Qatar pipeline business. 

Syria was the block that had to be removed if future Qatar  pipeline would be able to reach Turkish ports for oil delivery.

It’s all about oil.

3620 2018-12-24 16:51:18 Theees the rub, though. Falsifiability tells us science never *proves* anything. But the preponderance of evidence points to anthropogenic warming. And more profit incentive by big oil to sow seeds of doubt. Meanwhile they are now throwing all their chips in on renewable energy.

3627 2018-12-24 16:50:54 It surely isn't voting with Trump 1/3 of the time and cash-grabbing from oil CEOs.
3628 2018-12-24 16:50:25 It seems to be in cosmetics, food, and almost everything. In the meantime we are destroying our Palm groves and our environment, not to mention the balance of nature. Time to stop using palm oil products and finding alternatives which favor nature, not harm it.
3629 2018-12-24 16:50:19 Boo hoo for me, and the others in the oil patch. I sure hope we all made plenty "Spraberry Jam" to last the winter!
3630 2018-12-24 16:50:15 Trump is right about the Fed - there is no inflation - oil down big, housing prices are down, technology always makes things cheaper.  Only issue is some wage pressure, and that's not enough to raise rates.

3636 2018-12-24 16:49:36 Actually your president's gutting EPA, giving public lands over for oil extraction, proposing a silly wall that will have adverse impact on wildlife &wild areas--the list goes on--make the country dirtier.
3637 2018-12-24 16:49:34 Stocks and oil are not rising?
3638 2018-12-24 16:49:27 because some of the people who donated were oil CEOs donating the max
3639 2018-12-24 16:49:24 I'm back home at the @MontereyAq and they have a sign pointing out the complete lack of oil platforms in the bay. As someone that has done field work in the Gulf of Mexico, it reminds me why I love California.
3640 2018-12-24 16:49:22 I think Russia (not so much China) would be happy to subsidize Cuba on key supplies like oil if it means regaining leverage 90 mi away from the US. While they won't be as beneficial (even terms with Venezuela barely are as good as they used to), they will avoid disaster.

3654 2018-12-24 16:47:54 At what age did y’all start liking dark skin men? 

Cuz I was all kinds of “tar baby” “midnight” and “oil spill” until 2016 lol
3655 2018-12-24 16:47:50 Splurging on oil options today let’s get this money
3656 2018-12-24 16:47:37 I also think it could have to do with Rosnfet oil and the 19% that was gifted to someone around the election.
3657 2018-12-24 16:47:34 Rice and oil everywhere for house- it can only be christmas.
3658 2018-12-24 16:47:08 Or fry the donuts in something other than soybean oil.

3663 2018-12-24 16:46:54 Venezuela has oil.

3665 2018-12-24 16:46:51 No you are not. You are laughed at more than the second bush admin. They were worried that he would start Third World War over oil. They are worried you will start one over a Twitter war

3668 2018-12-24 16:46:13 Yes, we're familiar with the official line Tom Perez cooked up after he walked back the DNC pledge to refuse fossil fuel $. Bobby took more money from the industry than any other member of the House. You really believe that was all small donations from Union oil workers?
3669 2018-12-24 16:46:00 It is. It has always been. Reason: OIL.

3672 2018-12-24 16:45:39 Makes sense. Withdrawing from Syria makes Middle East more vulnerable to attacks from Russia, which is already in Syria. Up to 70% of the oil of the World are close to the finger tips of Putin. And our allies Turkey and Israel are more vulnerable to Russia.
3673 2018-12-24 16:45:38 How exactly did he break his pledge? Because some of the people who donated to him are employed by oil producers?

BJP govt under PM Modi has inaugurated the Paradip Oil Refinery & laid the foundation of Paradip- Hyderabad pipeline of Indian Oil Corp which will not only strengthen Odisha’s energy sector but will also boost employment & investment in the region

3675 2018-12-24 16:45:26 2) No, it really wasn't Iran's money.  3)  Iran gains from state-sponsored terrorism in expanding its ideology across the Middle East.  Every dollar earned is part of a "Total War"-esque economy which gains from its proliferation.  Also, oil infrastructure was built/aided by US.
3676 2018-12-24 16:45:25 true but at least we dont have oil sands and jordan peterson
3677 2018-12-24 16:45:20 Yasssss for the quick oil change
3678 2018-12-24 16:45:13 Russia's economy is struck in the mud. Big income earners for Russia and Putin have been oil, gas and diamond and all of that has changed. Russia having more oil doesn't solve their "we will blackmail you" strategy because we have more f all of it and now after 40 yrs we sell.
3679 2018-12-24 16:45:11 E no know nor get sense so forget. En head like oil rig.
3680 2018-12-24 16:45:09 Flowers are essentially like the Bunny Ranch in vegas. Suck nutrients, don't produce anything useful (Unless you are going high end like Saffron to trade or barter) but makes you feel happy. Sunflowers, like Oil Seed, could prep the ground, but don't need much space.
3681 2018-12-24 16:45:05 Hv u ever considered the consequence if u keep press down the oil price? Pls bear in mind wht vision fund is!
3682 2018-12-24 16:45:04 The last time they explained how we’d pay for it they said it would be easy and cheap and we’d be welcomed as liberators and we could just sell some of their oil.

3693 2018-12-24 16:44:15 oil is down to 44 bucks Nothing sets rooskies and illegitimate kings of saud and all the other thug warlords of middle east sultans and emirates them on shaky ground as price of oil does.
3694 2018-12-24 16:44:12 No we are talking about YOUR evidence dunce do try to keep up.

3702 2018-12-24 16:43:14 1)Some of his positions, particularly on oil and gas, are Texas positions and they would not be seen in a national context as progressive so that would be a criticism but I am not sure how fair it is 2) With CFPB he voted with the GOP initially but voted against on the final bill
3703 2018-12-24 16:43:09 I kept burping mint and trying to remember what it was and then remembered it was my cbd oil.
3704 2018-12-24 16:42:58 In my forecast oil falls to $10 during the global bust as demand plummets. It won't stay down at $10 long but it can get there. Near-term, I suspect it will bottom in the low 40's & head back to the mid 50's in the next 3 or 4 months.

3707 2018-12-24 16:42:49 can someone teach me how to put on falsies, i’ll teach you how to change your oil or how to replace your break pads
3708 2018-12-24 16:42:48 I wouldn't even add boiling water to hot oil. Better to pour the oil into water. Safety first, otherwise sounds amazing.
3709 2018-12-24 16:42:45 And he obviously is clueless about the plunge in the price of oil.
3710 2018-12-24 16:42:37 I’ve spoken to 2 trapeze artists, and both mentioned Mobil 1 is great, but not the best motor oil for engine longevity.
3711 2018-12-24 16:42:35 @AzurLane_EN Can you tell me about when "Combat Mechanics Danger Level" will come to EN sev. ?
right now chapter 10 is cost oil too much
3712 2018-12-24 16:42:31 Seek  stem cell research. You can afford to get access. Its going on in Panama. Also being exposed to viruses, Strep can trigger it. Mine just cleared after long painful period. I take no meds, can't afford. Massage area with organic coconut oil everyday can help as well.
3713 2018-12-24 16:42:23 Have to deal with the airport and flying today. 
So to start my AM I took an essential oil bath, and let me recommend vanilla, a touch of mint, a dash of lavender, and some lemon! 
RELAXED AS FUCK
3714 2018-12-24 16:42:09 We really don't want to go there. Our history, from trying to extinguish Native Americans to backing homicidal maniacs who control oil fields, is pretty damning.
3715 2018-12-24 16:41:52 That's right. the Fed loosened banking regs, gave us the big tax scam for the 1%, open public land for mining, open up coastal water for big oil, turned over environmental laws, started a tariff war with the world, did away with consumer protection, the list goes on.  Not Trump
3716 2018-12-24 16:41:51 Lip oil is my new holy grail
3717 2018-12-24 16:41:46 You must see oil at 20, labor crushing margins or China/DB collapse. Hard to see how we get to those valuations without some 2x4 across the face

3729 2018-12-24 16:40:35 Simple. Easy. I only use olive oil.  Guessing another may work.  Olive oil burns slower and takes a higher heat.

3734 2018-12-24 16:40:08 Let oil stay low. There is no reason for it to come back and we do not need oil to rebound for the market to rebound. Look at the interest rates. They are ignoring the fed.

3736 2018-12-24 16:39:52 I respectfully disagree.  There is evidence the Saudis significantly increased their exportations to the US after MBS met with Trump in March, only to be screwed when his administration issued 8 waivers to countries whishing to continue buying oil from Iran.

3794 2018-12-24 16:34:01 Andrew...   You’re less than creative in criticizing Justin Trudeau.  If you actually put forth something concrete, rather than simple slogans, I might even take you seriously. All  I see is a conservative puppet with oil execs working the strings.
3795 2018-12-24 16:33:57 So,you're this shallow?Is Lagos not getting 13% derivatn oil fee too since 2yrs ago(or so)?Anyway,I'm not surprised 'cos it's been proven that once you become a Buharist,then ur sense of good reasoning stops automatically!

3811 2018-12-24 16:32:55 Can we talk ourselves into a recession? Looks like a good chance! Oil prices near $44 per barrel and the gloom overshadowing every corner of the market are taking a fairly strong economy to the woodshed. The stock market is following suit erasing most of the last year.
3812 2018-12-24 16:32:50 Oh, it's never butter, just a ton of oil and salt that don't really interact with each other but sort of taste like fake butter.

3856 2018-12-24 16:29:19 I don’t think you realize how much oil we produce, we produce so much that we can’t even use the byproducts that comes out of refining.
3857 2018-12-24 16:29:14 I’ve been thinking about this since the Standing Rock pipeline protests, when friends V & G from our message board days tried explaining that oil pipelines are statistically safer than trucks so what was the big deal? And how they are smarter than me about economics BUT ALSO NOT.
3858 2018-12-24 16:29:07 Ya I think DDC says it’s ok

3866 2018-12-24 16:28:37 These comments miss a major question, "Venezuela is one of the biggest Oil deposits, where and who has ended up with those vast profits."  Is this a case of US O&G ripping off a country and leaving the country to collapse. US probably should take care of the refugees
3867 2018-12-24 16:28:31 Stop this trade war and anti oil rhetoric.
3868 2018-12-24 16:28:30 If you keep throwing Fox News type of arguments, there's no point in discussing. Venezuela's situation is far more complex than "socialism". And you know that it started when US lost the control of their oil.
3869 2018-12-24 16:28:21 Put them all on an oil tanker and ship them back to where they came from.
3870 2018-12-24 16:28:02 Governments will subsidize EV's for decades to come because the people demand action on climate change and seem to think EV's are the solution. Whether that's sound policy or not is besides the point. Ask any millenial right now, and they'll put oil up there with cigarettes.

3886 2018-12-24 16:26:08 I don’t know if we decline further from here. Depends on what growth does. It’s still solid at the moment, people are just expecting it to roll over. If oil doesn’t collapse we could see 5-10% total returns in 2019.

3891 2018-12-24 16:25:24 Well, let's see how comfortable Russia is with oil at $50 like they said. If they hadn't been so opportunistic about market share, they would have made a deal the first day and cut more than a measly few hundred k barrels.

3896 2018-12-24 16:24:58 It fascinates me that the Liberals have this innate ability to simultaneously piss of environmentalists *and* oil & gas supporters with every decision.

3900 2018-12-24 16:24:32 I don’t ever see trump asking opec for oil production cut.  He thinks low oil will get him out of this mess.  Trump is an idiot.

3911 2018-12-24 16:23:13 The RSPO (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil) was established in 2004 with the aim of promoting “certified sustainable” palm oil. Unfortunately, this initiative was too little, too late, with lax membership criteria and only two members thrown out for non-compliance to date.

3916 2018-12-24 16:22:51 We need to consume less palm oil to save what rainforests are left. Palm oil is not sustainable. Having visited the Indonesia island of Sumatra many times and having worked with local, native people there is no such thing as “sustainable” palm oil.

3931 2018-12-24 16:21:17 No punch line. He could be brilliant. He is taking over a huge club with good players so could have a good six months and might keep the job. 
I'd actually prefer if it was Liverpool and United battling it out for prizes than the oil brigade but that's just how it is right now
3932 2018-12-24 16:21:06 The key is the Velocity of Money which is 5.6x the dollar turns over in a year is anything but inflationary. A neutral reading is VOM is 7.5. Also, there is nothing signs of wage inflation and look at copper, lumber and oil prices which are at or near their lows. The FED is wrong
3933 2018-12-24 16:21:05 No. We're saying Beto never violated the pledge (which says to not KNOWINGLY take more than $2K from oil & gas execs.) Prove Beto KNOWINGLY took money ($34K) when it all came via Act Blue which doesn't collect job tiles. PROVE IT or put a sock in it.

3948 2018-12-24 16:19:48 @realDonaldTrump you're going to have to let oil rally if you want the market to go back up
3949 2018-12-24 16:19:32 Well, for me to understand the inflation rate, I just go to the Kilombero market here in Arusha, I then buy sugar, cooking oil, soap bars, maize flour and Mchele. I get home and compare prizes with the last yr's. Well I find out the inflation rate is small as reported. Simple

3951 2018-12-24 16:19:31 And you're clueless. You can't demonstrate a single bad thing causes by CO2 and there are demonstrable benefits to the use of fossil fuels. Oil companies have almost certainly misrepresented things, but they also probably lie far less than governments.

3978 2018-12-24 16:16:41 Lol wtf ? His voting record and his violation of a pledge to not take oil money is not a fucking “smear tactic”. It’s relevant info that we’re supposed to care about, but apparently we’re choosing to pull a Trumpian “fake news” and attack the messenger. This is pathetic.
3979 2018-12-24 16:16:37 How about a politician that represents the will of those voters who put him in office?  Besides, Beto’s all about renewables, he just knows the switch won’t happen overnight and would prefer oil & coal be made safer in the interim.
3980 2018-12-24 16:16:36 Yes, supply side issues addressed. Not demand though. Needs monitoring as Q1 world economic numbers could reveal 1% or less. When rate of change of world-GDP changes that much, oil prices are unlikely to react to a drawing inventory, rather they react to a contracting GDP.

This whole 'stolen' rumor is fun but the concrete evidence, as you will see, doesn't entirely support it.

4038 2018-12-24 16:10:59 We all make choices, every day. @StandMighty's report "Chocolate's Dark Secret" shows what consumers don't know when buying their favourite chocolate brand. Not only palm oil but also the cocoa beans!
4039 2018-12-24 16:10:57 Again, I do not disagree. I'm saying the new jobs need to be union to protect the workers, and that transitions are difficult for people. Yes, coal and oil jobs are declining, but changing from one industry to another is difficult for workers, esp. financially.

4063 2018-12-24 16:08:32 2018 has been a year full of Negative News for the Markets, some of them are,

1) LTCG
2) Poor Budget
3) Nuclear War threat
4) Election Uncertainty
5) ASM Frame Work
6) High Bond Yields
7) Highest $ rate against ₹
8) Higher Crude Oil Prices
9) Trade War
10)  markets Sell-off
4064 2018-12-24 16:08:27 Most combustion engines today emit mostly H2O...a by-product of perfect combustion. In the old carburetor days, oil, dirty gas, and poor combustion produced a smoke instead.
4065 2018-12-24 16:08:25 Its a sin the extent of criminals in the political agenda...we need to oust them as they stealing monies destroying America to utilize oil for Russia and Saudis..
4066 2018-12-24 16:08:20 You sure have a lot of bunk excuses George. In Canada, nothing is subsidized more than oil & gas. What are we at, 9 billion this year? And yet renewables and EVs are still winning as they are more economic even without subsidies!

4077 2018-12-24 16:06:55 Beats me really- the obsession with the two big parties. Maybe like Standard Oil they should be forced to break up. Political monopoly is not good for a democracy.
4078 2018-12-24 16:06:51 I’m getting my oil changed right now. My poor baby is so many miles over
4079 2018-12-24 16:06:42 re: beto though, a lot of the criticism is out of context. “he accepted money from oil & gas industry” isn’t really the whole truth. he accepted money from working ppl who work in oil & gas and he is required to report that is more true. he didn’t accept any corporate PAC money.
4080 2018-12-24 16:06:38 $DBC at 52WL, but much of that is oil as I recall.
4081 2018-12-24 16:06:26 Lisbon Treaty - In 2022 we become an EU state, and have to give up our currency, sovereignty, and nationality. No more Queen, our fishing rights, gas, oil, minerals, all EU property. Stock exchange financial centres moved to Strasbourg, agreed over 10 years ago, it’s scary stuff.

4091 2018-12-24 16:05:29 Use gentle cleanser. I dont do oil cleansing(it makes my skin tend to have more bumps). Try to wash with oatmeal( once at night or morning) . Avoid scrub. Use aloevera.

Tax cuts have lead to reductions in tax revenues, and fiscal hawks don’t care. 
Trade war has lead to reduced exports but increased imports to China. Yes, the trade deficit has increased LOL.
Oil production is doing well though.
4097 2018-12-24 16:04:55 You guys should not finish our "coco" ooo.

4105 2018-12-24 16:04:26 It's not any of the banks. They are not owned by the State. It has to be gas and oil or something along those lines.
4106 2018-12-24 16:04:09 However the only problem that America and rest of the world has is YOU. Sinking oil prices, onset of a worldwide economic recession, aggressive and unexpected trade wars, blame game and finger pointing others is a result and by product of your failed decisions!

4111 2018-12-24 16:03:22 Prime rib demands some great roasted garlic mashed potatoes. So out on that grill of mine are two head of gorgeous, fragrant local garlic roasting with good olive oil, sea salt and cracked pepper. Nom nom nom...
4112 2018-12-24 16:03:21 These fights are about how much Russia can subsidize Belarus' economy and the fact that domestic oil sector tax changes in Russia are going to raise costs for Belarus, which refuses to economically reform because it threatens the system Lukashenka has built.
4113 2018-12-24 16:03:17 Well it is noted in KJV bible about a fool and their money.  Proverbs 21.20.   So this shapie is just leveraging the modern snake oil.

4119 2018-12-24 16:02:34 Sure. They deserve the blame. But what will happen is they will block oil by rail. The collateral damage is OK by them, if it helps put another nail in the coffin for  Canadian oil.
4120 2018-12-24 16:02:24 Better oil de Ur head
4121 2018-12-24 16:02:17 It's not any of the banks because they are not owned by the State. It's probably gas and oil.
4122 2018-12-24 16:02:15 When refrying beans use bacon grease but if you dont have that use butter but if you don't have that use regular oil.

But i always have butter so that's what I'm doing today.
4123 2018-12-24 16:02:02 Lol. “Democratic activists”. The only people clamoring for Beto are oil executives.
4124 2018-12-24 16:01:57 Nothing to do with the UN - any oil & coastal arrangements will be negotiated if & when we ever vote to break up our U.K.- bear in mind the coastal limit is only 12 miles anyway.

4129 2018-12-24 16:01:36 The Fed is ignoring what the market is telling it: the yield curve, long-term interest rates, money supply growth, inflation, oil prices, housing starts.  Like the old Jethro Tull song, the Fed is living in the past.
4130 2018-12-24 16:01:34 Give your oven a clean before cooking #Christmas dinner. Oil, grease and bits of food in your oven can easily start a fire.

Look, I'm glad that you think that getting donations from "dozens" of "executives" in oil & gas is proof of his irrevocable taintedness, but to the rest of us it sounds like a convenient way to be dismissive.

4144 2018-12-24 15:59:51 @jjlkfi Wayne is right , baby oil is not good for latex condum s
4145 2018-12-24 15:59:43 Agree, strongly. Westminster has no respect for the devolved countries.. Huge oil reserves off West Coast according to industry reports. Life sciences , universities, sustainable energy resources, IT technologies . tourism ,food and drink etc. etc
4146 2018-12-24 15:59:42 You know about supply and demand, so you understand that an overabundance of anything causes it’s value to fall. 
That’s why the fracking #boom crash oil prices, and why printing #money causes #inflation. It’s why sand is so cheap. So, does the same hold for labor markets ?

4154 2018-12-24 15:59:03 Oil down nearly 3% at $44.50 a barrel - another low for the year. Sharp fall in revenue for major oil producers going to start impacting Middle East spending in the West. Banks in UAE understood to be in trouble. Contagion effect.
4155 2018-12-24 15:58:43 The Dems and Republicans have the same agenda and it’s a buzz kill.  Transfer oil to a Russian billionaire through UK brokering.

4158 2018-12-24 15:58:26 Oil from Alberta oil sands (wells to wheels) emissions are getting close to world crude averages. Soon you will be begging for more! World oil production is increasing due to people demand. If you want to reduce, you need to attack consumption not production.

4173 2018-12-24 15:56:36 Oil development in Trinidad: So tourists do not see flares all over the island, all natural gas (methane) which flows with the oil is VENTED directly to atmosphere.

4175 2018-12-24 15:56:30 I see your point. Same reason Henry Ford paid his factory workers well. But I don't begrudge anyone earning a decent wage. Here in BC, wages are so ridiculously low that we have a skewed view on what people should be paid. Oil worker salaries are in line with cost of living.

4181 2018-12-24 15:56:10 I’ve been waiting for the excuse/blame game and oil wasn’t $156 a barrel under GEJ. Besides if oil prices are $30 now (they’re not) why is fuel still N145 per liter? I eagerly await the scapegoat from you as nothing is ever the fault of APC.

4186 2018-12-24 15:55:41 I’m not defending those collards at all. I’m saying that at one time a collards recipe likely started w/ a flavorful, oil filled seed being worked down to produce oil to serve as fat.  That’s still a FAR cry from that recipe board.
4187 2018-12-24 15:55:35 I totally get how you could blame Jewish players for using US soldiers for petty oil wars to help the US elite. I still don't understand how those wars benefited Israel? Genuine question.

4200 2018-12-24 15:54:26 I went to the dealership to get an oil change buuuut ended up getting like 10 things done to my car lmao
4201 2018-12-24 15:54:25 I once invested in Midwest oil wells.
At $45/WTI I dont see how *anyone* can justify drilling in non-Permian formations where there is the slightest question of reserve risk.
I would expect to see non-Major drilling hit a wall next year.
Is that baked into the employment #s?

For Syria, as for alliance value, they can leave anytime they want but they should not leave their allies, SDF, to Turkey. 
Second, USA can only leave ME when oil is dried and ME radicals stop threatening US

I want the best candidate with a proven track record. Is Beto terrible? No. Can we do better for 2020? Absolutely

4210 2018-12-24 15:53:41 Xmas eve sex tip for the ladies: If you’re wondering how to increase sexual desire, start paying attention to sexual info and practice fantasizing. Easy as noticing something sensual, gently clenching your pelvic floor muscles, or appreciating your body when you apply lotion/oil.
4211 2018-12-24 15:53:37 I receive well the plan of @MBuhari led govt to diversify our economy from entirely oil dependence to agriculture as also intended by @GEJonathan but I also think we should look at other industries such as education, health, talents, etc too. We can export these too.

4228 2018-12-24 15:52:20 That’s nothing. Oil from Victoria’s coronation - pah. If he’d really cared,  it would have been from William the Conqueror’s.
4229 2018-12-24 15:52:20 And Yemen is a disaster while the Saudis are cutting production of oil such was a betrayal on you Mr. President.

4231 2018-12-24 15:52:08 Why are oil and energy stocks down? Traders expect a recession in major countries such as UK, US, China, France, Canada, Italy.

4236 2018-12-24 15:51:56 Every mideast war startin with the Gulfwar, were for 2 things. Oil and opium. Now use that and mentally rebuild these alliances up with those 2 things in mind and you find that it wasn't sadam, or Iran or whoever fault..it's all bankers and pharmaceutical companys..deep state.
4237 2018-12-24 15:51:55 Trump needs oil to rise or its all over... And with regard to credit alot of crappy companies doing decent today
4238 2018-12-24 15:51:55 Meanwhile Texas ..which is dominated by the oil industry calls themselves right wing. However these oil Companies in Texas take the most corporate welfare of any industry. Silicon valley tech Companies don't get government handouts like oil Companies
4239 2018-12-24 15:51:53 The entire administration is made up of snake oil salesmen, their friends and their friends’ kids are the interns doing all the “work” for free. What did you expect when a criminal turns our government into a shell company?

4243 2018-12-24 15:51:35 I'm happy to hear it! I haven't quite figured out how to make the blender or spray work quite right, and haven't tried the cookie oil thin, but the oil I've used for quite a lot!

4262 2018-12-24 15:49:45 The USSR needed to be opposed, but overthrowing benign left regimes in favour of right wing dictatorships lost us the moral high ground. Our oil companies have left us with Iran. That mess has left us with an Iran/Russia alliance that's going to get stronger.
4263 2018-12-24 15:49:45 So my mum has left a box of mints in all our bedrooms cus she can be sweet like that. Anyway my brothers gf borrowed my coconut oil and when I went to get it back I noticed their box of mints was sat on top of a box of chocolates

4296 2018-12-24 15:45:55 @realDonaldTrump  maybe you should read some history over XMAS and understand that it was Americas desire to maintain a strong influence on regions of interest in the world. It started in the Cold War and continued to secure access to cheap oil.  #ResignNowTrump

via NaMo App
4311 2018-12-24 15:45:12 The reason we take other oil over our own is due to a trade agreement that is out dated and needs to be redone. We would also need to increase our refineries to use what we produce.
4312 2018-12-24 15:45:11 I just wish someone could explain why university oil profits are not passed on to students? The cost of tuition in this state is out of control since deregulation, and the two with oil reserves are the worst.
4313 2018-12-24 15:45:08 Got my second buy in for Phillips 66 $PSX this morning, at $80.75. Great #dividend, not necessarily hurt by low oil prices. They are a buyer of oil. I know my price at the pump hasn't gone down dramatically.

now Iran gets more money ,  greater danger ,  typical BS trump  deal
4334 2018-12-24 15:42:51 I've started buy some of these beaten-down Canadian oil producers ($WCP.TO $SGY.TO and $TOG.TO.  Nice fat monthly (sustainable?) dividends (~7-8%).  Tax-loss selling has been relentless.  Either this will turn out to have been a very smart move OR incredibly dumb.  
4335 2018-12-24 15:42:48 Same folks make it deem like the dude is owned by oil and gas becasue he took donations from oil and gas "execs"...But then the true fact is that its a total of 21K from 25 managers/Executives that donated through actblue in texas. a whopping 0.21% of his total haul 2/
4336 2018-12-24 15:42:45 Finally some oil exports there. Costly export subsidies giving some results...

Worrisome that industrial exports are pretty much ineslastic to FX depreciation.
4337 2018-12-24 15:42:39 You might want to go check the price of Oil, which is crashing, housing prices are falling, food prices are at rock bottom prices thanks to Amazon and Walmart, the dollar is increasing and rates are very low and going lower...Tell me where this inflation you are seeing? lol
4338 2018-12-24 15:42:36 Who Care about it.? When its rise we blam the modo govt, but when it getting low it's global oil prise low...

4341 2018-12-24 15:42:04 Putti gets worlds 2nd largest oil reserves Don or @realdonaldtrump gets tower in Russia. #Syria deal during #shutdown after Don gets ride of #Mattis Opinion: Don is simple minded. Putti has long range strategy.

4346 2018-12-24 15:41:42 Since Trump has been President economy is up, unemployment down, N. Korea is at the table, ISIS is gone, the US is leading oil production, CO emissions dropped, ISIS is defeated, troops leaving middle East, embassy in Jerusalem, Iran is in compliance... maybe stick to UK politics
4347 2018-12-24 15:41:41 For what it’s worth my favorite album of the year is SOPHIE’s utterly brilliant Oil of Every Pearl’s Un-Insides. Also, really enjoyed Jon Hopkin’s Singularity; Gorillaz’ Now Now; Thom Yorke’s Suspiria; Pusha T’s Daytona & Beach House’s 7.

4352 2018-12-24 15:41:36 It’s called reality which I guess you don’t no anything about.  . Have fun in your world where Mexican drug lords don’t exist and CA is too pure for oil production

4355 2018-12-24 15:41:18 Multiple spots, up to 5mm diameter. Closest I could compare it to is when you get oil on paper and it goes kinda transparent
4356 2018-12-24 15:41:13 Those who purchased Treasueies Trump after rates increases by Powell, will unload for short term profit taking.....the only logical move would be Gold or Oil and most unlikely at high prices already.....Oil or Currencies will balloon......windfall for the Banks

4365 2018-12-24 15:40:10 Your record is broken... Look at the market and the economy for the succesrating of your policy. Throwing oil onto the flame doesn't make it any better

4369 2018-12-24 15:40:02 I get the joke, but here’s the rub: 1. both affected by prospects for global economic growth and 2. oil is a good example of buyers finding low-cost functional alternatives from competitors (US shale)

So, mark this as likely
4370 2018-12-24 15:40:01 You would make a good snake oil salesmen.

How do you explain such drivell to kids
4371 2018-12-24 15:39:57 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.

4376 2018-12-24 15:39:26 I no longer buy products containing palm oil, for one I don't see the necessity, cocoa is already oily, why add palm oil to chocolate and there are other oils that can be used in bar soap and body wash.
4377 2018-12-24 15:39:23 Thank you for finally getting US out of other countries business. They don’t want us there, so now they can fix their issues on their own. Plus we have enough oil, we don’t need theirs.
4378 2018-12-24 15:39:22 I don't believe that just like I don't believe everyone who works for an oil company is some evil anti-climate change nut job.

I don't know much about him other than what I saw of him running in Texas.  You know, fucking TEXAS!

So I approach him with an open mind.
4379 2018-12-24 15:39:17 #cityofedmonton. Time to call out counsel on the consistent tax hikes. Times of low oil prices high unemployment loss of high paying jobs the city still see fit to tax their people. Marry Christmas Edmonton the city need you to anti up for their mismanagement
4380 2018-12-24 15:39:16 As long as @POTUS trusts BUT verifies Turkey’s every move I am on board. Also it is way past time for other Middle Eastern countries like S.A to protect their own interests. Before we had to bow down to S.A for oil but no longer thanks to @realDonaldTrump #AmericaFirst

We haven't given up anything. Except for the luves of soldiers for nothing but the chaos we created in the ME for oil
4385 2018-12-24 15:39:04 Lol era sarcasmo, soy Economista. Y ahorita no me preocupa este asunto, llevo todo el año diario viendo como caen las bolsas estadunidenses y ya empieza a afectar otros sectores. El oil está en 45 USD y antorcha chillando por presupuesto. Viene un puto desmadre, y viene de fuera.

4400 2018-12-24 15:37:33 Trump is giving Turkey Kurdisch oil (maybe not realizing it) because it will not only fight ISIS but also the Kurds who helped the US..
4401 2018-12-24 15:37:33 Man the winner in Syria is socialist @EmmanuelMacron  he has his Troops with Kurds Turkey won’t get closer ! Franch gets all Kurdish oil and natural gas ! Regarding Kurds  they been there for 6000 years they never end !  The problem is in Dems who found Isis !

You could blame them for the weather too. For US Bakken Oil that's in the same position as WCS. Blame them for 44 years of wasted prosperity, Ralph bucks,

4420 2018-12-24 15:35:58 LoL even though our imports of oil from the middle East didn't increase much after the invasion. It's extremely expensive to ship oil that far. Most of our oil came\xomes from the US, Canada and Central\south America.

Not defending the wars there but facts kinda matter. 
4421 2018-12-24 15:35:52 In your opinion what’s keeping America from high speed rail?  Big oil interests?

/ Cash sent to Iran in the nuke deal was their $$ that we had seized, not U.S. taxpayer $$. You believe in looting the Mideast (see your quotes about Iraqi oil), but most Americans are not thieves.
4460 2018-12-24 15:32:28 They will invest heavily in renewable energy when they see their oil and gas profits threatened not some public policy. And I don't believe in the neoliberal ideology that markets are gods and don't care what investors care about when climate disaster is already here.
4461 2018-12-24 15:32:28 A lot of it was basic upkeep. Which gas to use, fuel/oil mix ratios, oil and filter changing, basic safety standards and procedures to tell when a Worker 1 was fucking with my OSHA mandated break schedule

4465 2018-12-24 15:31:54 So your graph shows Canadians  spends billions purchasing half their oil from places like Angola. Thanks.

4474 2018-12-24 15:30:20 HI Helima would you please be kind enough to explain if all the large oil producing nations are cutting oil productiion wouldnt that  cut supply raise demand and increase oil prices ..?
4475 2018-12-24 15:30:16 明日は使ってもらえると信じて眠るよ。
4476 2018-12-24 15:30:05 Keep saving the American people and saving the dollars.   We need it for the war on the Devils that contol the democrat party and the rinos.     No reason for Syria other than to prevent an oil pipeline which goes against the devils rule of the saudi supply chain of oil money.
4477 2018-12-24 15:29:56 You have continually taken the quote about “reject(ing) the false choice between oil and gas and renewable energy” out of context. I’m not going to argue with his voting record, but at least don’t twist the guy’s words just to “shame” him. His stance on climate change is logical.

4487 2018-12-24 15:28:30 Snake oil doesn't work, but ill sell you some if you've set aside 0.11% of your budget for it.
4488 2018-12-24 15:28:24 I was thinking about my parents today as well. My dad has been gone more than 30 years and my mum more than 15. His present would have been Old Spice and hers, Oil of Ulay. Miss them both terribly even after all these years. Have a great Christmas dear. No football tomorrow.
4489 2018-12-24 15:28:16 Oil demand increasing is neither a positive nor a negative. It’s a reality. Saying we need to transition to alt energy is a theoretical and unrealistic statement so a near term solution is to choose CDN oil over foreign oil.
4490 2018-12-24 15:28:14 But even THEN I’d only smoke it to sleep which doesn’t help my anxiety throughout the day  been contemplating CBD oil as well. Happy i saw this thread!!

4499 2018-12-24 15:27:02 It's not just the recession. It's all the bragging about the oncoming shale tsunami. This unhinged, uneconomic, unbridled, debt-fueled growth can only end in one way - by oil prices crashing so severely that the entire industry is decimated.

4513 2018-12-24 15:25:14 You subsidise the military’s of rich countries so you can control them and control their oil and banks
4514 2018-12-24 15:25:05 I was thinking meth lab too, or they were trying to make hash oil and haven't blown it (apts) up yet.
4515 2018-12-24 15:25:04 Do you neti pot? If not, I'd recommend it. You can pick one up at any CVS, Walgreens. And/or put some water to boil in a pot over the stove, drop in some peppermint essential oil, ease head over it and inhale.

4519 2018-12-24 15:24:48 There was a time when I thought the most logical macro thinker I knew of was Jim Rogers. A decade ago, according to him I should have only owned oil, farmland and airlines.

4525 2018-12-24 15:23:47 Markets are focusing on Permian supply, pipelines coming online too much, the crude is too light. Heaving oil, from different basins, are not seeing much supply growth. #CrudeOil #OOTD
4526 2018-12-24 15:23:42 Not everyone wants to be stoned though. We just want the calming effects.
And if you’ve been smoking for awhile I think CBD oil might be effecting you differently  people that don’t smoke are gonna get better results I’d THINK. That’s just my opinion though
4527 2018-12-24 15:23:40 Closed my $CHK position at ~1.82$ taking the loss.

Reduced my $OBE position by 50%. 

Reduced by 20% my $SLCA position.

Oil is going down and until this stops the sector is hated. Valuations are crazy low but can get cheaper. Will get back in when oil bottoms.
4528 2018-12-24 15:23:40 Military industrial complex wants more influence.. Not with Trump central bank wants to raise interest rates to collapse the economy on trumps watch. So Trump took our troops out of Afghanistan (opium trade) and Syria (oil) to push back on the companies seeking a profit.
4529 2018-12-24 15:23:35 The issues in the Middle East are a result of global meddling over the products in production...ie opium and oil. The West has manipulated the Middle East via warmongering long enough.
4530 2018-12-24 15:23:32 Turkey will eradicate Kurds that have been helping us to fight ISIS not the IsIs. Turkey’s only opposition is Kurds. Do not forget that Turkey was buying Oil from IsIs.
4531 2018-12-24 15:23:17 US: supposedly civilized, moral society
Saudi Arabia: barbaric people who hate women & can't see a future w/o oil

Trump: "MAGA"

What do you think he should have done? Are you more angry it's being discussed than that it happened?
4544 2018-12-24 15:21:59 Uh they will blame the overspending on bad oil prices but they do nothing absolutely nothing to aid in building pipelines!
4545 2018-12-24 15:21:57 I just wanted to take some oil painting classes :(

Yet, those hands will never hold anything

4557 2018-12-24 15:21:02 It is dirty oil. Only good for heavy oil uses such as machine oil. If you see the environmental damage you would hate it. It is extracted by using water and then the waste water is just dumped elsewhere to kill birds and other animals. Go check. Fuel come from other oil sources.
4558 2018-12-24 15:20:59 Nah looks lik the Kerla cook who adds coconut oil to tandoori..
4559 2018-12-24 15:20:57 Something’s wrong when so-called Americans are too stupid to realize Trump just gave Putin (in exchange for hotels, loans, blackmail) a GIFT of the 1/3 of Syria considered “useful” (all the oil and water), and turned allied Kurds over to a murderous Turkish regime. Way wrong!

4575 2018-12-24 15:19:10 Gundlach has sometimes been right, and sometimes been wrong. He loved Oil this year too. He is ABSOLUTELY talking his book. He should not be on TV during trading hours. Drukenmiller now cares about public policy. Bloomberg interview way better.

4608 2018-12-24 15:16:13 Summarizing individual contributions from oil and gas employees—in a state where oil and gas is a major employer—as “oil and gas industry money” certainly strikes me as dishonest. So does the “I’m just neutrally reporting numbers!” bit he did when people objected.

4619 2018-12-24 15:14:49 I said months ago the reasons for this have  not even been made public yet, stuffs coming out now, Oil has put some banks in percarious postitions, could this lead to a liquidity banking crisis, that could be the unknown factor powering the downfall, Gold keeps inching higher

4624 2018-12-24 15:14:31 It’s very simple the United States has been pumping oil like it’s going out of style for over a year. It’s completely supply driven not demand if that is what some like to use as an excuse that a recession is coming. Not even close
4625 2018-12-24 15:14:31 Maybe actually define an Ally.  The Kurds are not allies, we protect their oil.  How many of these “allies” would actually come to our aid if we were attacked?
4626 2018-12-24 15:14:25 @gzchef Any quick tips on how to select higher quality olive oil at the store? I heard somewhere you should look for settling at the bottom?
4627 2018-12-24 15:14:22 that is completely dishonest.. You are subsidizing Saudi military by protecting their oil shipments.

4642 2018-12-24 15:13:19 Sirota is pointing out Beto's record of voting with the GOP and big oil, and his refusal to get behind Medicare for All. Do you think these are things that should be ignored, @tiburke ?

4644 2018-12-24 15:13:15 The only ones making that kind of money are the energy companies (oil and coal). And they feel their incomes threatened by climate change, so they started the hoax: that climate change isn’t real. They had the money and incentive and ability to organize. Scientists do not.

4648 2018-12-24 15:12:45 At these oil prices Saudi Arabia is bankrupt. Same w/ Iran.
4649 2018-12-24 15:12:43 I found Sirota's initial work on Beto's financing to be sloppy. Used a metric that, when used on Bernie, made Bernie look owned by the Defense Industry. Doesn't mean Beto isn't dirty w oil $, just that the reporting didn't prove it. I pointed it out, and Sirota blocked me. Tool.

4683 2018-12-24 15:08:59 Hi Josh. Thanks for the write up. But why do you compare WTI benchmark oil price to WCS, the second cheapest Alberta oil, instead of the Canadian Crude Index? Surely it is a better indicator of overall Alberta oil prices when our oil can cost more or significantly less than WTI?
4684 2018-12-24 15:08:46 Has nothing to do with springs.. It's a dampener, either air or oil. Movement of piston in cylinder displaces/compresses the fluid inside and the natural tendency for pressure to equalize returns it back to original state.

4741 2018-12-24 15:03:14 Aye @40URTY what's a good beard oil for my boy here? I'm thinkin Cremo Tea Tree. What say you?
4742 2018-12-24 15:03:12 Um...oil gets all kind of subsidies and tax breaks.
4743 2018-12-24 15:03:12 If you're freaking out over stock market stop! Much needed adjustment from the very overvalued tech stocks. Amazon was over $2k..crazy prices. Impt is that price of oil is DOWN which significantly benefits US, the consumer with lower prices at pump. China lowering tariffs

BJP govt under PM Modi has inaugurated the Paradip Oil Refinery & laid the foundation of Paradip- Hyderabad pipeline of Indian Oil Corp which will not only strengthen Odisha’s energy sector but will also boost employment & investment in the region.
4764 2018-12-24 15:01:39 No sir not at all. When our countryman and women paying high fuel prices we also faced same difficulty overseas, there was a time when we paid over 80 rupees/litre. Now the international crude oil prices has fallen and hence the difference is clearly visible (1/2)
4765 2018-12-24 15:01:38 These oil rich middle eastern countries can surely afford the cost of their militaries!

4777 2018-12-24 15:00:28 The Jamaica article is bullshit, exaggerates the solar ENERGY delivered by about 300% . Jamaica is building a large natural gas fed combined cycle turbine to replace an older oil fired plant, solar can only serve as a natural gas extender.

4786 2018-12-24 15:00:00 It’s that time-honored tradition of teaching your daughter how to change the oil in her car. So we are headed to Starbucks for coffee and then will drive across the street to Jiffy Lube for an oil change. Done. Teaching your kids new things is easy!

4796 2018-12-24 14:59:08 Did you ever hear how US Navy redeployed Fifth Fleet, deactivated since the end of WWII. And the redeployment 'coincided' with the discovery of your huge offshore oil deposits and Lula was furious because the fleet started patrolling your waters.
4797 2018-12-24 14:59:06 Dow/S&P/Nas basically trending in lock step , Nas slightly worse. Gold & Treasuries catching a bid , oil lower. 2

4806 2018-12-24 14:58:20  I feel like she has some tips for oily skin!! But I'm not sure. My skin is pretty tame and I'm definitely lucky to not have to deal with a lot of oil or dryness except in the winter.

4809 2018-12-24 14:58:16 Man throw some beard oil in that bih, get you a beard comb to comb that bih, and most importantly eat pussy like it's the lunch special. Watch what happens.

Also, consult your barber. If yo shit patchy there's ways he can line you up to make it look cleaner until it fills in.
4810 2018-12-24 14:58:07 Made this morning for me and some to give to neighbor. Used last of my Genovese olive oil for this, which has a peppery bite.  This is one of the best salads I've ever had.  My neighbor is going to love it.  Thank you so much!

4846 2018-12-24 14:54:51 The showmanship can be impressive, but the same could be said of snake oil salesmen. Giving patients the warm and fuzzies is fine, but not when you’re falsely claiming to treat illness and charging $.

4849 2018-12-24 14:54:02 Aww your father took lots of money from Wall Street, Oil and gas industry, Super PAC’s, hell he even started one (that is failing miserably), hasn’t released his taxes and owns three homes. Sounds like a typical 2% to me.
4850 2018-12-24 14:53:52 A major quiet divestment from a key upstream oil player by one of your MCM billionaires is in progress. He is either cutting his losses or has eyes on another sector of the industry. Either way, this is saying something about our economy and a cause for pause for any investor.

4857 2018-12-24 14:53:32 It is key to our national security that we maintain our status as a net oil exporter. We must be energy independent so that we are not forced to make foreign policy decisions based on a need for oil.

4880 2018-12-24 14:51:25 Whisk egg yolk with a tablespoon of olive oil and leave on hair for a few minutes before your shampoo. It makes a great hair conditioner.
4881 2018-12-24 14:51:24 Oil falling has counteracted some of the silly FED hikes.
What has been steadily rising is the vitriol in the Media.
This has encouraged many to think a bad economy is good
solely for political reasons and to hell with the Union 
retirement accounts.
4882 2018-12-24 14:51:20 we can say with certainty that the Indian government has no influence in the fuel prices. I have been observing the crude oil prices and fuel prices in some nations. The only difference i observed is minimal. We yet need to completely let fuel prices be controlled by int. prices.
4883 2018-12-24 14:50:58 I'm not expected a big response, just disheartening when a supermarket who produce the BEST meat replacement, say they're comcerened about the environment (avoiding palm oil, non recyclable plastic) replace these products with cheesey garlic breads .....

4905 2018-12-24 14:48:27 The past 6 months point clearly to another world economic crisis soon.

It might be worse than 10 years ago.

Oil prices are plunging lower despite it almost surpassed $90 a few weeks ago.

Hoping this does not lead to a 2nd Tun vs Anwar clash like 20 years ago.

4915 2018-12-24 14:47:45 When oil prices are low because we can't get it to international markets, production slows down/jobs are lost. The TMX and the Energy East pipelines are critical to getting fair market value for our oil and getting these people back to work. Paid protesters?! They want to work...

My opinion oppose importing of OIL. Build a pipeline and use Canadian Oil First!
4956 2018-12-24 14:44:11 Rigious observance is the problem. It is the reason Islamic countries are poor or reliant on oil. It is why it is attracted to successful economies by migratn/conquest and render them impoverished. We need to understand Islam is an economic model that only worked in the 7c.

4982 2018-12-24 14:41:32 I feel like a lot of the scrutiny has focused too much on stuff like individuals in the Oil and Gas industries donating (>1%) to his campaign, and not enough on his actual legislative record and his justifications surrounding that.

5115 2018-12-24 14:26:32 Plan olive oil I agree with. Blood orange olive oil though is fantastic.
5116 2018-12-24 14:26:29 Not if Damascus negotiates for a certain amount of oil to be delivered in return for concessions, but you may have a point there. Also under the Islamic State the oil still found its way across Syria so why not deal with the SDF.

5121 2018-12-24 14:26:00 Govt will be in much better position when oil price is high as profit derived by Petronas much outweigh petrol subsidise..

5122 2018-12-24 14:25:57 They were more geared towards brent crude when  it was illegal to foreign trade unprocessed American petrol....

5155 2018-12-24 14:21:53 It is disgusting the chicken hawk media wants other kids to die in Mideast over some oil pipeline
5156 2018-12-24 14:21:49 Beds are Burning - Midnight Oil ... video scared the crap out of me!
5157 2018-12-24 14:21:48 Changed a diaper 
Cooked a meal
Served a meal
Washed a dish
Cleaned a toilet 
Changed his car's oil
Built with legos
Milked a cow
Mucked a stall 
Shoveled snow
Mowed a lawn
5158 2018-12-24 14:21:46 You’re not a stoner unless you shoot straight Rick Simpson Oil into your asshole while eating 3000mg infused edibles
5159 2018-12-24 14:21:39 For large oil companies with giant overheads, true. North Sea oil is now extracted by small firms that specialize in enhanced recovery. They make plenty of money if not the old superprofits. Everything fades.

5164 2018-12-24 14:21:07 i really don’t get embarrassed easily. 

like i literally used to pee my pants from laughing too hard. and this would happened often, you guys. 

but i feel some sort of shame for going to get an oil change and my car being A DISASTER.
5165 2018-12-24 14:20:50 He did not. And that still matters. You don't have to consider it reason to not support Beto. But we are in a climate catastrophe and the fact that oil companies have money is the reason. Thus sort of thinking is what got us here.
5166 2018-12-24 14:20:46 Bank liquidity is obviously very important but do you really think they are remotely close to needing help? Ha! If #FatNixon wants to manipulate an equities rally he’s gotta start by getting oil back towards the 50 handle.

5171 2018-12-24 14:19:55 It's still yummy! I use olive oil a lot too.
5172 2018-12-24 14:19:51 Wait till the dems take the house next week!  I’m hoping for at least 5 more investigations in to this snake oil salesmen’s underhanded dealings
5173 2018-12-24 14:19:48 The most having oil province of Iran. Reza shah threw him away. In fact Iran didn't profit from its oil before Pahlavi. The shah was the one who told to the UK in 1974 "we don't sell you oil by the previous price while you're selling us your goods by the new prices."
Pleas go &
5174 2018-12-24 14:19:32 For those that believe the FAKE NEWS MEDIA : REMEMBER THEM TELLING US THAT WE WERE RUNNING OUT OF OIL?  And 50 years ago THEY SAID THAT FLORIDA ETC WERE GOING TO BE UNDER WATER BY NOW? I am 73 years old I REMEMBER! Them ‘news people’ REALLY CAN PILE ON! And dumbs believe .
5175 2018-12-24 14:19:29 Ha ha, the white paper produced by @theSNP wasn’t just false but in some areas fantasy.  What’s the price of a barrel of oil today James?
5176 2018-12-24 14:19:12 Get ready to rub that oil, Chaps.
5177 2018-12-24 14:19:06 水(ウォーター)とは仲が悪いです。

5179 2018-12-24 14:18:53 I love mojo verde. Easy, fast and delicious.  Any soft herb, roasted garlic,  lemon juice and emulsified in your blender with a neutral oil like vegetable oil.  Salt and go dipping.

5185 2018-12-24 14:17:57 Kalo mau nuntasin clogged pores sebaiknya gunain cleansing oil juga biar hasilnya maksimal
5186 2018-12-24 14:17:55 My dog refuses to eat his food unless there’s olive oil in it........ why
5187 2018-12-24 14:17:41 The question has always has been with Alberta oil companies.  The money is in new innovative product lines. Yet rather than creating new jobs. producing new sustainable products. they would seem to like wasting money taking on a changing marketplace.
5188 2018-12-24 14:17:33 They've already moved past that point - see the recent Energy Dept report that cynically admitted climate change was happening but effectively said it was too late to do anything so we might as well not enact policies that would hurt big oil.
5189 2018-12-24 14:17:27 Every hustler kwesiri irasha oil...OIL! bu nno mbada jam! @phynofino
5190 2018-12-24 14:17:18 Milk cleansing itu bagusnya buat dryskin, karna ga berat di kulit kering. Kalo oily pake mw aja.
Nah kalo cleansing oil bisa buat oily maupun dry skin. Cleansing oil juga jenis cleansing paling bagus, karna bisa ngangkat makeup waterproof sekalipun.
5191 2018-12-24 14:17:15 what type of oil does that mac use ?
5192 2018-12-24 14:17:13 Salmon oil in food
5193 2018-12-24 14:17:12 We are now at the point in the disaster movie where someone says 'We only have 10 seconds to save the Earth' and instead of anyone doing anything sensible the Governments all cry 'The Arctic is melting! Hooray! Faster shipping routes and more oil!!!" We have 2 years. That is all.

5204 2018-12-24 14:16:07 I need so much castor oil
5205 2018-12-24 14:16:00 North sea oil cost more to produce than the market price. Scotland couldn't afford to run NS oil rigs.
5206 2018-12-24 14:15:59 聞いてくれ！！！いつも醤油せんべいのにおいがする娘の手のひら、今夜はローストチキンのにおいがする！！！！今日はご飯の前に風呂入ったから当たり前っちゃ当たり前だけども！！！
5207 2018-12-24 14:15:43 Don't Be Afraid of Fat. Healthy fats are excellent for every area of your health - necessary. Long term studies have found a low-fat diet does not help your heart. Add healthy fats such as fatty fish, grass-fed butter, avocado, olive oil, or nuts to every meal. #healthychoices …
5208 2018-12-24 14:15:42 それ。生徒が勉強しないのは講師がモチベを上げさせてないからみたいな的外れな事言ってくるし、バイトの面接でポンポン即日採用するのに、「合格率〇〇%から選び抜かれた講師」みたいな電車の広告出してるし。
5209 2018-12-24 14:15:42 I'm  sorry for your situation but you should understand better tham most that what you see there, that finds it's way into most peoples diets via high fructose corn syrup, corn oil & processed food, is destroying metabolic health & promoting obesity and inflammation epidemically
5210 2018-12-24 14:15:41 i use coconut oil religiously
5211 2018-12-24 14:15:40 SA is growing rapidly but a slower lifestyle. More “Texas” though that’s hard to quantify. Houston also the home of the Oil and Gas industry for the country.
5212 2018-12-24 14:15:30 Oregano oil and black seed oil 
5213 2018-12-24 14:15:14 は？可愛すぎかぶち犯すぞ

5215 2018-12-24 14:15:07 Global Warming is a HOAX!  It was created to make money!  Al Gore and his cronies are making billions on a HOAX!  Because Oil isn't making them money anymore!
5216 2018-12-24 14:15:03 Oil is a lubricant.
5217 2018-12-24 14:14:52 The refineries were built to accommodate the reality at the time and what seemed to be that of the future. Economic shale oil (much lighter grade) was a myth until very recently. Canadian, Venezuelan, Saudi oil are all heavy.

5220 2018-12-24 14:14:28 Absolutely but they won't, ishlam is the predominant belief in countries with oil.
5221 2018-12-24 14:14:20 Chris, Obama armed rebels thar morphed into ISIS. Let them sell oil to turkey(Nato), so in my mind he helped them. The first thing Russia did was bomb 1000's of tankers to stop their funding.
5222 2018-12-24 14:14:16 Coconut oil ! JAMAL has eczema and he’s been using it for two weeks now since i told him about it and his face cleared UP !!!!
5223 2018-12-24 14:14:16 This hole is used to pour oil into if your lock becomes rusty. It also allows any liquid that seeps in to seep out.

5225 2018-12-24 14:14:07 I use charcoal and have been oil pulling for years.  I will try the clay because I have receding gums but no dental insurance.

5227 2018-12-24 14:13:51 Oil is following SP500 lower in a risk-off environment. The fundamentals for oil are getting stronger as production is being cut day by day now.
5228 2018-12-24 14:13:49 show me one country which is under US sanctions doing well, look at venezuala, Iran etc. these countries have oil but mmm pakaipa
5229 2018-12-24 14:13:48 I've met a lot of albertans that feel like the rest of Canada dont contribute as much as they do (oil money!!!) Also most canadians dont like Quebec to varying degrees.
5230 2018-12-24 14:13:46 Dont over think it. Simply pat it dry, coat in oil, season and bake.
5231 2018-12-24 14:13:41 food fight w/ dreamies would be so wild like chenle would deadass throw an egg at your face, jisung will smh pour oil on you, markhyuck will just ignore you and fight against themselves while jaemin will try to clean you up but noren keeps on slapping you with cake mix :-)

5238 2018-12-24 14:12:57 هذا هو سؤال الترليون دولار!  كيف تبقى احتياطات البترول ثابتة او في ارتفاع بالرغم من استخراج مليارات البراميل سنوياً؟ هل هناك تطور في تقنية وأساليب الإستخراج وبذلك يرتفع معدل البترول القابل للإستخراج recoverable oil او هناك 'احصائيات سرابية' غير واقعية؟

5243 2018-12-24 14:12:42 Its tragic as our very existence is threatened by matters we can reverse in time "if" politics (Big Oil wants at Putins Antarctic ,Arctic oil bonanzas but ice gets in the way of profits)would care about humanity /ecology more than Oil profit potential...Its about Oil Folks

5248 2018-12-24 14:12:11 ARE YOU HIGH?!?!?!  The deficit is off the charts.  Investments tanked once again.  Tax giveaway went to the wealthiest.  25% of federal workers aren't getting paid. Once protected land is getting raped by big oil.  And now the new SOD is inexperienced w/ no military background!

5255 2018-12-24 14:11:35 Your information is completely wrong. Reza shah was the one who burned the 1919 agreement in which UK had profited Iran's oil by that & it had signed in Qajar era. Also Sheykh KhazAl was Khuzestan's govemore who was the UK's puppet & gave the oil completely to Uk. Khuzestan is

5260 2018-12-24 14:10:50 I agree with you but right now the ME region needs tough Arab leaders who won't be yes men to the west bullying tactics Erdogan owe Russia a favor so they will get rid of the SDF in towns/key oil fields In the east cut their funding/supply lines.

5276 2018-12-24 14:09:26 This is exactly how the Fake News Media helps Gov. start Wars. Gov. Propaganda giving the Gov reason to kill without cause. Can't believe the Media. They have helped greatly, causing the death of millions over the greed of oil and cash.

5287 2018-12-24 14:08:45 I really want to do a huge oil painting of that bath one. Beautiful. 
5288 2018-12-24 14:08:40 Bet you think “religion has been the leading cause of war” too, or that the US only fights wars for oil. Grow up
5289 2018-12-24 14:08:38 If the oil was in a phial it was never used to anoint anyone - unless Old Vic collected it again afterwards.
5290 2018-12-24 14:08:38 First of all he have committed a very serious crime in islam, seeking for a lady’s hand in marriage after she have been betrothed is haram, talk more of after she’ve been married! He should stop instantly! Subhanallah!

5293 2018-12-24 14:08:16 Try coconut oil. It works really well for me, hopefully for you as well :)
5294 2018-12-24 14:08:13 The same guy that said Beto is "owned" by oil and gas because he took 21K (0.02% of total) from oil and gas managers/executives through 25 individual donations on actblue. That same guy? We will see if bad faith arguments and MAGA tactics work on democrats
5295 2018-12-24 14:08:10 I have used a whole bag of sugar, a bottle of lemon juice, a fresh lemon, baby oil and exfoliated atleast twice a day AND I STILL HAVE FAKE TAN ON... I have no more ideas nor time

5302 2018-12-24 14:07:32 The $5 billion for a wall that will be ineffective could be used to update existing agencies and create new ones to maintain security. They will find a way around this phantom wall and then what? Your wall was the call of a snake oil salesman and you keep taking the oil.
5303 2018-12-24 14:07:29 Don’t boil them. Roast them in olive oil and chilli

5305 2018-12-24 14:07:16 Aren’t the corrupt people in Uganda feeling guilty to celebrate Christmas?  Any way , if Jesus’s birth was to be procured using Ugandans, Marry would have lost to another woman who would manage to oil the system or even the birth would have been delayed for administrative review.

5310 2018-12-24 14:06:29 anna even this is bullshit. Now people will compare $100/Brl in 2013 Vs $60/Brl now.

Have to be one step ahead - expose Cong defaulted on 50K cr oil payments to Iran + 60K cr oil bonds which have to paid with 8% interest in 2022-24.

Cong tried to buy 2014votes with future debt.
5311 2018-12-24 14:06:24 Pakistan’s balance of payment crisis seems to be ended for current fiscal year as the government is expecting financial package from China and defer oil facility from United Arab Emirates (UAE) within next few days, via @Imranalikundi
5312 2018-12-24 14:06:18 Don't put a "+" in the sprouts; it makes em soggy.  Don't bother with goose fat for your spuds; olive oil is much better.

5327 2018-12-24 14:04:42 Truck drivers for oil and gas! THATS what’s making Beto from being pro oil and gas. 
5328 2018-12-24 14:04:33 IDPs in other parts of Syria would be denied access to that oil money as per your argument...
5329 2018-12-24 14:04:33 YES, it’s about time we have a Pres who does what he said he would if elected. (Or tries)
5330 2018-12-24 14:04:25 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
5331 2018-12-24 14:04:22 “One More Try” reminded me that if you can pull off a strong black baptist church double clap to a song, it’s got that oil on it.

5333 2018-12-24 14:04:08 It’s a little mixed. & it’s not just poorly managed socialism that sunk Venezuela. It was big oil corruption & authoritarianism & strained relations with the US that resulted in import shortages, which then lead to a drop in productivity & crime & a massive negative feedback loop
5334 2018-12-24 14:03:32 Me = oil

5337 2018-12-24 14:03:22 I have to say I think $WTI is a serious key in having our markets stabilize. Once oil gets moving I think we have a tradeae move coming.
5338 2018-12-24 14:03:20 Market stops global recession panic, opec production cuts cause global inventories to decline, us rig count will fall in January as E&P’s complete 2018 programs and start up reduced 2019 programs. Fall in rig count will mark the bottom for oil prices. Then POP!!

5341 2018-12-24 14:03:13 You are rube who's been conned by the individual action argument. That argument was sold to you on behalf of industry which is the major driver of climate change. You're cutting your own throat so oil can make more money. It'd almost be funny if it wasn't so sad and pathetic.
5342 2018-12-24 14:03:12 Me too! There is so much beauty and meaning like the olive branch and the oil in ritual and ceremony. I had two olive trees, but only the one on the east side survived and thrived, I love it
5343 2018-12-24 14:03:05 Very important to know about Crude Oil prices in next year. US is adding more drills and Trump wants to keep oil at low price until he gets re-elected. Cheap oil releaves goods pricing, even though it's negative for global economy. OPAC cuts and US pumps. Very f.up situation.
5344 2018-12-24 14:02:56 wow... coconut oil makes cookies WAY sweeter then  necessary
5345 2018-12-24 14:02:45 Not Obama, he has taken PAC $ from big oil> thinks reaching across the aisle, playing naïve collegial charades with the GOP enemy, accomplishes something - 62 votes against ACA, the tax act, relentless lies & unswerving complicit  support for Putin's puppet. Dems need Swalwell

5349 2018-12-24 14:02:21 The truth, up to the 70’s $$ we’re based against gold. Nixon changed that in a deal, oil to be priced in US $. This gave the US/Saudis’ power. Now climate change is changing that. Oil is losing power. The truth is the scheme is catching up. US debt bad, will destroy the Country.
5350 2018-12-24 14:02:21 Just curious... could it be that in TX, there are so many people working in the Oil/Gas industry that some of them are, gasp, Dems? You assume all oil execs are Rep. You know another place with a concentration of oil jobs? Richmond, CA. Check out how they vote

5358 2018-12-24 14:01:16 Once built, renewable energy has very little impact, compared to the designed failure of oil and gas

Your dead dinosaur energy will run out inevitably, so why not save it for what’s REALLY important and cannot be replaced, defence, & save our water for what really matters, life?

5383 2018-12-24 13:58:20 i was at a little dorm party thing and there was a "make your own lip scrub" activity and i brought down one of my essential oils and then a face oil because they also had face masks and i use the oil after masks usually and one girl picked it up and said "can i use this?"
5384 2018-12-24 13:58:16 Sure, go ahead & accept them but don't #Bullsht me about who he's really working for. Why would "oil and gas industry workers" want Beto so very very much?

5393 2018-12-24 13:57:20 True. But John Terry for example had 78 caps. Now Terry was an excellent centre back, his reading of the game was exceptional. But he had the turning circle of an oil tanker and similar sprinting speed. A fit King was better than Terry in my opinion.
5394 2018-12-24 13:57:17 Truly. Also...most charlatans use the line, “Our secret ‘inner circle’ oil will just work. Trust us.” If both the past and the future are being clouded by obscurity then don’t trust.

5410 2018-12-24 13:55:16 The oil reserves’ card? It will be allocated to fill the needs of the people and IDPs across N-Syria and the reconstruction effort. If the regime wants it, they can negotiate for it.
5411 2018-12-24 13:55:07 Apparently carbon emissions from Saudi oil are not counted and a bigger flaw is it has never been gender analyzed or human rights qualified.  Team Trudeau needs a Royal Commission to study these anomalies.  Better idea $50 bbl import duty.
5412 2018-12-24 13:55:06 So also we didn't hear of oil scarcity too
5413 2018-12-24 13:55:05 He was lying. Natural/"fracked" gas causes several times more harm than even oil/gas because it releases far worse chemicals into the atmosphere in far greater tonnage just getting the stuff out of the ground. Anyone proposing using a "different" fossil fuel is still just wrong.

5419 2018-12-24 13:54:46 Are you aware that the underlying cause of the Syrian conflict is an oil pipeline? Are you ok with our military dying for corporate interests? Are you good with displacing millions of Syrians, creating the refugee crisis, all for a pipeline?

I answer these as yes, no and no.
5420 2018-12-24 13:54:39 Angalo-iranian oil company shared 85% of the profits from iranian oil to zionist UK. US/UK led coup ‘operation Ajax’ happened just when iran tried to nationalize those oil companies, then aid was given to keep the dictator Shah in power as long as he kept giving US/Uk irans oil

5450 2018-12-24 13:51:02 We already have 40 years worth of reserves, and we've been finding oil faster than we've been consuming it for decades. Running out of oil is not one of my 50-year risk factors, and probably not on my 100-year list either.

5464 2018-12-24 13:49:19 I could point out that the collapse of oil prices due to the over production of shale oil in Canada and the US has had a critical effect on the Venezuelan economy but you wouldn't agree with me if you understood it. So I'll just say live well and goodbye

The oil export vote and the gulf drilling vote don't inspire confidence that it was an honest mistake, and not indicative of his views.

5519 2018-12-24 13:42:38 And I’m assuming you were referencing the price of oil in your comment above. It may surprise you to know that the US purchases oil FROM Mexico. They are one of our top 5 sources of petroleum. We pay them.

5549 2018-12-24 13:39:33 Does the energy industry (oil/gas) prefer a firing squad or a hanging at dawn?  Either way the Trudeau and his minions want you dead, buried and feeding the worms.  Happy New Year to You All
5550 2018-12-24 13:39:32 I was going to go outside and get some fresh air. Looked out the window and saw frost on the cars and thought, “the air in here will be just fine with a lil eucalyptus oil.” 
5551 2018-12-24 13:39:23 Several cannabis stocks are trading lower after the recently passed Farm Bill labels hemp oil as a drug ingredient requiring approval for use in products. CBC currently not permitted based on what I'm reading. $ACB $NBEV
5552 2018-12-24 13:39:22 Petróleo $WTI va en 44.88 (-2.18%)
En mínimos del año. Crude Oil
5553 2018-12-24 13:39:19 The same Turkish gov involved with bribes in a Gold for oil deal with Iran violating US sanctions? The same Erdogan that accepted a oil tanker as a gift in return for citizenship? The same Erdogan that shut down a corruption investigation and fired those involved. Then there is..
5554 2018-12-24 13:39:07 The might US Military Industrial Complex could make a lot of money from this.  We know about the huge arms deal with Saudi Arabia and the pending F-35 deal with Turkey.  Saudi is fighting Iran to control Yemen's oil reserves, now they can fight Turkey, protecting the Kurds,maybe.

5568 2018-12-24 13:36:52 Okay so my mother-in-law makes the world’s most perfect crispy potatoes by cooking them in about 1/4” of oil that is warmed in the pan prior to cooking. They’re brilliant.
5569 2018-12-24 13:36:49 Indeed we should credit 100 years of innovation to dirty Oil and not humans ingenuity!?  Please remember your statement when you are breathing bottled air while looking over an acidified ocean covered in dead things. Wont be too long if we follow to people like you:)

5581 2018-12-24 13:35:02 I like your imagery. You are the Noah of the oil markets.
5582 2018-12-24 13:34:39 I’m betting most people have never donated to politicians before. When you donate, you have to disclose the company you work for and what you do for them. If you’re an accountant for Baker Hughes, then Sirota considered you “oil & gas interests.”
5583 2018-12-24 13:34:25 And that's why we are the major if not only, oil producing nation that imports over 90% of it's refined petroleum products.
5584 2018-12-24 13:34:16 CBD oil.
5585 2018-12-24 13:34:16 It is even worse when we discover that all oil and gas operations in the UK were owned by the people of the UK until the Tories stole it from us and gave it away to Spivs & Speculators in return for stupid-money boardroom jobs.
5586 2018-12-24 13:34:08 There is a huge old wine press in Nazareth, Called a Gethsamane (means wine press), there r 4 categories of oil each produced by increasing weight

China's population alone, no its not there faults,  it was the way of the world
notice not one of these great democratics caring about selling coal   shit oil
5593 2018-12-24 13:33:22 palm oil is a product that is very inexpensive and allows companies to make a large profit when they put it in food. however, the harvesting of palm oil destroys habitats for orangutans and causes a great amount of devastation to the land.
5594 2018-12-24 13:32:54 Coal isn't killed, it is saved for some future generations to use when other fuels will run out, such as world oil reserves.  But fracking tech may improve too.  I do feel the population is well over-running oil reserves and will end up failing to solve the BTUs needed for people
5595 2018-12-24 13:32:38 Wait, something is shut down?  We haven’t noticed.
5596 2018-12-24 13:32:35 It is bc he is tightening into a slowdown. The oil and bond markets were telling him that's a bad idea and he won't listen (yet) so now the stock market is trying to tell him to stop.

5612 2018-12-24 13:30:32 There will still be future oil booms, just not to the level as we've seen in the past.  Maybe enough people will be scared off that it will stabilize.  Likely not though.

Norway has since 1964 extracted 5% less oil & gas than has been extracted from Scottish territorial waters in the same time. The difference is they have a sovereign wealth fund producing profits of  $181 bn / year.

5629 2018-12-24 13:28:27 Hey dipshit, his money was individual donations, most under $200, from people who work in the oil and gas industry.

If you really want to make money trading WTI, get rid of the bad habit of barrels counting, which is the job of big boys and oil pundits. Retail traders are NOT qualified to do such a tough task.

5639 2018-12-24 13:27:25 Mark my words, Oil& Gas Stocks buy/sell decisions are the realm of the expert traders & chartists in 2019. This sector is going to leave an ugly trail sure by end 2019 with dad& mum investors and Oil sector employees/servicemen as main casualties.
5640 2018-12-24 13:27:24 Time for crude oil to rip higher already.  What is the sentiment ?  -10 ?  Lol
5641 2018-12-24 13:26:59 Oh my! There’s a little more to it then that. And different types of hair really needs different products and care. Some needs slightly more oil, etc. And men (and women) often have thinning hair which is a pain. But yes, growing it out can be great!

5664 2018-12-24 13:24:15 Most of the content of the Bible should have little bearing on your day to day. It’s based on a wholly different type of existence in a bleak an brutal world. Anyone who gives as much credence to Paul as to Matthew is selling snake oil. Same goes for most of the OT.

5672 2018-12-24 13:23:35 Why did the British try to reclaim the oil fields collectivised under the Bolsheviks. The foreign powers actively tried to destroy the soviets in so many ways that it's ridiculous. The only time there was any congeniality was during WW2 in fighting Hitler.
5673 2018-12-24 13:23:31 I think God wanted to fine tune my daily gratitude. I’m thankful to be warm (a tank of oil), thankful to be able to walk (had an injury now healed!) and to have my family here for Christmas. Praise God! 

Merry Christmas James! Hope the octave of Christmas brings many blessings!

So, for some to say, "I think Beto shouldn't have taken money from oil workers," is totally fair. But to jump from that to he is "in bed" with the fossil fuel industry is absolute bullshit.

5691 2018-12-24 13:20:09 @FoxNews Americans conveniently forget one reason Obama pulled out of Iraq, a war fought for oil, not about terrorism, is b/c we were a "war weary" nation. trump pulled out from Syria b/c Turkey's president told him to. Remember there r 2 trump towers in Turkey.
5692 2018-12-24 13:20:06 My mum was about to send me to go and buy Palm oil. There was a knock at the gate, I went & met a certain guy my dad helped sometimes ago with a Job. He brought 25 litres of Palm oil for us to celebrate Christmas with. God is good.

5740 2018-12-24 13:14:01 I'd had my air filter changed one time to an after market one put in at one of those quickie oil change places. Totally messed up my truck. Dealer switched it to a real Ford one and problem was solved . Seemed it was starved for air.
5741 2018-12-24 13:13:59 It comes with colour coded oil so it doesn’t bugger up your paving.
5742 2018-12-24 13:13:56 The de is fine just be mindful of the oil
5743 2018-12-24 13:13:53 That's about the same color as the Altamaha river in Georgia. I have a couple tricks for that. Weightless chartreuse trick worm. Motor oil worm with gold fleck and orange tip. Along with jigs, and topwaters. And a crankbait or three.
5744 2018-12-24 13:13:46 Labour policy does not mention protection of biodiversity once. Biodiversity & protection of the natural environment is core to saving our living planet.

5752 2018-12-24 13:12:21 Largely small donations from individual employees of the oil industry is no different than donations from anyone else. People work. People donate. Beto's donors were normal ppl. Sirota deliberately misrepresented that. No surprise from a Sanders cultist threatened by a new face.
5753 2018-12-24 13:12:18 We have seen injustices from time immemorial ranging from Apostles being cooked in hot oil to being crucified upside down but no one has seen this spectrum of cruelty where a child is made to sit-squat in solitary confinement at an angle 90’ gazing forlornly at flushed Masonry.

How can we believe you'd take the IPCC report seriously?

5765 2018-12-24 13:10:37 This year we are adopting the Hanukkah model for the holidays ( three days of Christmas). The question is not whether the oil holds out, but the wine.
5766 2018-12-24 13:10:37 Correct, the hard working Scots and their land, sea and oil wealth being taken to London to feed the fat cats who think they’re entitled to it. It’s time to take it back and cut them loose 
5767 2018-12-24 13:10:23 But it's ironic too, because they are either A) ignoring B)not using economic models that show their own demise if they continue this way...even oil heavy countries are diversifying away from oil. Maybe there is hope?

5825 2018-12-24 13:02:13 They are acting like prima donnas. They are thinking they have been hard done by so the rest of Canada should be coming to their aid. Surely they can see the writing on the wall that their oil business will soon be winding down.

5833 2018-12-24 13:01:01 you know your stuff.  in the older days, perhaps cooking with a bit more oil was considered to be an luxury, since even cooking oil was once rationed.  now the issue is not really about nutrition, but excessive amount of everything.

Dissapointed with Indian oil
5871 2018-12-24 12:56:21 Residents would be given a better rate on the system.  Industry to pay an environmental tax on the Hydro lines.  

Oil can then take on an environmental tax directly, raising the price slightly, however we will be using less, so it won't be noticed.
5872 2018-12-24 12:56:13 Easy. He has the support of the oil and gas industry and some Dems are still addicted to energy industry money.

5874 2018-12-24 12:55:44 The stem of the orange that runs through the middle of the orange stays attached to the orange peel "bowl," and that's the wick. It absorbs the oil, so it burns like a candle/lantern. No smoke. Just a nice long-burning flame that smells a bit orangey.

5882 2018-12-24 12:55:06 You should understand that Erdogan supports ISIS. Turkey buys oil from ISIS. Turkey only wanted the US to leave so he could wipe out the Kurds. How hard is that to get.
5883 2018-12-24 12:54:57 We will always need a certain amount of oil for certain applications.  

Wind/Solar should be used for residential and lower voltage uses.  

Industry / high energy sectors should have to buy from Hydro Dams instead.  Use what's already in place.

5893 2018-12-24 12:53:19 Guess again. I’ve got a couple of Fibonacci counts looking at 2000-2100 & maybe in the 1800’s. What is the most terrifying is the price of oil. Maybe if oil will bottom, stocks can bottom.
5894 2018-12-24 12:53:04 Idiot talking point. While you bring that up as meaningless argument the swamp has walked away w/the store.

5918 2018-12-24 12:48:29 This is sad.  People have been saying this for half a decade now, wrong ever year while more and more oil comes out of the US.  And this wrongness has real consequences - oil producers would reform if they would stop dreaming that Brent would go back to $115.

5971 2018-12-24 12:41:03 Obama is a neoliberal who did nothing to reform Wall St, created an oil boom at a time of climate change crisis, supported coups in Honduras & Brazil with terrible consequences, expanded drone warfare, police mitarisation, & deportations, bugged climate delegates in Copenhagen..

6200 2018-12-24 12:07:48 At your old age. You do not know that Lagos state today still gets share of revenue from oil producing states including Abia. You do not know that Lagos was capital of Nigeria for decades and it was collective resources just like Abuja that developed it. But continue.

6234 2018-12-24 12:02:51 It depends on your hair type. If you have thin/fine hair, it has a tendancy to produce oil quicker and therefore you may need to wash it more frequently because it appears dirtier faster. Thick hair—sometimes you can go days without washing and it still looks fab

6238 2018-12-24 12:02:25 He does control prices. He said he's phasing out fossil fuels, that impacts investment. We buy oil from Saudi Arabia , that effects prices. He exempted Saudi oil from carbon tax, unfair competition. Alberta is hemorrhaging investment.
6239 2018-12-24 12:02:04 Perhaps you and your 95 followers you gathered since 2010, would like to explain how that works to my Oil Company who won't deliver oil to keep us from freezing to death bc we didn't get paid.

6253 2018-12-24 11:59:10 I thought Trump said he would bomb the hell out of ISIS, take their oil & not give them a heads up on any of our tactics? He said last week ISIS is defeated & this week Turkey is going to defeat ISIS. 
We do not have a rational president in the Whitehouse. #EveryDayIsChaosDay
6254 2018-12-24 11:59:04 Just surprised he’s on here tweeting and not purchasing a lifetime supply of snake oil supplements from Drew Brees.

6270 2018-12-24 11:56:16 The tragedy is, in the same way crude oil is sold in US$, Guinness is denominated in Euros. So even with that money back, I still won’t be a pint a month better off. And the threat still hangs over us of a hard border, and “No Guinness at all...”

6273 2018-12-24 11:55:10 Sleazy Scheer. At 4:40 he gets a look on his face & almost stutters because he realises just how stupid his answer is. Irving oil is the one importing from Saudis, even with Energy East it says it will still import Saudi oil, so whose "consumer dollars" is Scheer on about?

6276 2018-12-24 11:54:26 This has been a long play by the Kochbros . They are following daddies old JBS with a twist of blending their business with the Russian Oil Oligarchs under Putins direction. All was good for them, as long as it was for " business".
RICO for the Oligarchs who committed treason.
6277 2018-12-24 11:54:22 Is that the name of the oil? I'm in need ooh
6278 2018-12-24 11:54:16 Have you paid any attention at al to the independent news outlets that cover the shit that goes on. The Koch bros plays a hand in the nonsensical wars our soldiers commit the dirty work for so companies like Exxon mobile get their oil in the Middle East. I already said the cia
6279 2018-12-24 11:54:04 Have you read the Lisbon Treaty - In 2022 we’d become an EU state, & have to give up our currency, sovereignty, nationality. No more Queen or King. Also our fishing rights become owned by EU, and all gas, oil, minerals, all EU property. Financial centres all moved to Strasbourg.
6280 2018-12-24 11:53:36 I tell you what, it's annoying trying to take photos of the dog on my slow, glitchy phone that takes ages to make the camera actually work... I might as well try and get him to sit still for an oil painting! 
6281 2018-12-24 11:53:36 It is not fair for Trump and market participants who are now receiving margin calls. Besides, oil prices are so low now. So, risk of inflAtion is zero.
6282 2018-12-24 11:53:33 Yes, lots of big individual donors in oil and gas. That category of donation, however, made up less than 1% of his total donations.

6295 2018-12-24 11:50:41 It would be helpful if the media could demonstrate to Albertans that Quebec purchases zero Saudi oil. You know, clear up the popular (or is that populist?) misconceptions. #CBC #CTV #abpoli

6320 2018-12-24 11:46:01 why not think for yourself instead of just following your glebeite neighbours? We buy foreign oil but we also produce oil. The foreign oil comes from a country that doesn't treat women equally. Now put your mind to work - how would buying local make sense in this scenario?

6360 2018-12-24 11:39:15 Profit, oil, industries are not the problem. It is the irresponsible management of the drillers. The sabotage of the equipment by locals. The oil is like a garden. You till it for your future survival. You abuse it, you don't eat.

6373 2018-12-24 11:37:01 You think mainstream Dems, like pro-fracking Hickenlooper and 'that was me' Obama, are doing enough to combat the climate crisis?

I think perhaps it's worth getting exercised about the fact they aren't, rather than justifying some guy who has consistently voted for oil & gas.

6515 2018-12-24 11:16:06 This Lebanon/Honduras equivalence is false. The "West" and the M.E. have been politically, economically (& now socially/culturally enmeshed to a greater extent than previously) for quite some time. Oil, Russia, Israel,and Palestine help to make this a hot topic for debate.

6518 2018-12-24 11:15:43 It’s literally not true, and he’s been removed from the “No PAC” pledge because of it. 75% came directly from oil/gas corporations not individual workers. You obviously have never read Sirota’s or the sludge articles you’re claiming are incorrect.

6523 2018-12-24 11:14:55 Yes, everyone knows that of course. But I mean some sense of urgency is needed. The Chinese is already using their currency to trade oil with other countries. This is a very serious threat to the national security of the States. The Saudi Prince was just exceedingly friendly ...
6524 2018-12-24 11:14:53 The vast majority of his donations from oil/gas were from normal-ass people. 24 were "executives." Most people won't give 1 damn because they don't hold the spurious belief that accepting a donation means a candidate has adopted every political belief of the donee. We're adults.

That finished me.
6555 2018-12-24 11:09:45 So the Fed bought $85B/mo Treasuries for 10 yrs, but now the economy is strong enough to sell $50B/mo.? What's the problem? Oil is down, but not part of inflation calc'n. @cvpayne

6565 2018-12-24 11:08:20 I have watched these with great interest. Now you need to make a similar program about Scotland’s governance and focus on the limitations we face due to lack of control of major economic levers. Focus on oil and transition to renewables
6566 2018-12-24 11:07:58 And to put it more positively, in my opinion, it won't last. I'm guessing 2019 and 2020 will be crunch time for big oil and global finance with a better approach beyond.

6655 2018-12-24 10:50:48 Big action on climate change - a huge growth and employment area for poorer areas of the UK, an R&D free hit, reducing any reliance on oil is generally a good idea, a massive opportunity to put the UK at the front of the world in an industry. And obviously a good idea generally!

6676 2018-12-24 10:47:33 Is a good question. I think it’s a few things, all layered. Birthplace of Jesus/perceived as origin of Christianity. Centuries of wars of aggression (both ways, to be fair). Oil. It’s a deadly combo for rationalizing a proprietary attitude towards mid-eastern/Arab resources.

6683 2018-12-24 10:46:27 They sell refined carbs to vegans because that's the only source they can have that contains enough calories to overcome the (usual) lack of fat in their diets, although they could add coconut and/or olive oil to their diets, most other vegetable oils are hazardous to health.
6684 2018-12-24 10:46:26 Am I understanding this right? Oil prices rise because oil prices are currently low? Like that's the only reason?

6697 2018-12-24 10:44:45 There is a reason why when the oil price went low Venezuela tanked. Perhaps it's too expensive to get it out of the ground and the price of sale is too low. 

Otherwise keep living in the fantasy world Aaron.

6704 2018-12-24 10:43:41 No, Hoe-ward, the way Bernie Sanders has been getting trashed for the last 2.5 years is because he’s a threat, but it actually helps him, since they have nothing to do with policy.

If you think exposing Beto as a sellout to big oil helps him, you’re dumber than we all thought.
6705 2018-12-24 10:43:31 Bioavtur made from Malaysian palm oil?  I think that’s the usual way to decarbonise flight; once avtur from air capture CO2 exists we’ve already won.
6706 2018-12-24 10:43:26 He didn't "slime" any individual. That's nuts. He pointed out that Beto has gotten a lot of money from people in the oil and gas industry.

6712 2018-12-24 10:42:42 If "individuals in the oil industry" are supporting Beto with campaign contributions then he is not the right candidate for me or for the country. We need someone aggressive about moving on from oil and he is like a #Dinosaur stuck in La Brea tar pit. #NeverBeto

6721 2018-12-24 10:41:25 If oil can prop up whole of UK (including current Sco spending) when Brexit does its worse, then Sco is in a great position. Rather like the look of other Indy countries like Norway. Imagine making our own decisions, having control over our future. Normal for most. Scotland soon.

He has let Islamists through to join ISIS. He has treated wounded terrorists and let them go back and rejoin IS. His son in law has bought the oil from IS and helped them to finance themselves. 
Now he enlists IS an Al-Qaeda fighters for his militias.
6775 2018-12-24 10:32:53 Trump: "Now, are we going to stay in that part of the world? One reason to is Israel. Oil is becoming less and less of a reason because we’re producing more oil now than we’ve ever produced. So, you know, all of a sudden it gets to a point where you don’t have to stay there.”

6797 2018-12-24 10:29:45 For most part not american politicians are guilty for such price. The extraction points in venezuela which has the largest amounts of oil  out of all countries are not working because of their stupid authority. Thus the rest of the suppliers rise up the prices.
6798 2018-12-24 10:29:44 I am glad that we pulled out of the #Paris climate accord. Paris is burning due to increase taxation on gas due to this climate accord. #USA will not play by this nonsense rules. #activist  Burn the forest (woods) if you don't want to use oil. #AmericaFirst

Not my problem to stop them killing each other.

And now US doesn't need their oil, (thank you, fracking),  not theirs either...

6816 2018-12-24 10:26:12 Does she have a name?
6817 2018-12-24 10:25:51 Is that because the oil scrubs off the capsaicin easily (when you obviously can't use soap in your eyes) or are there actual neutralising properties in the specific vegetable oil you use?

6823 2018-12-24 10:24:47 As I recall, the driving force for the West in the region has been to protect the oil fields in the Middle East from the Russians.

6902 2018-12-24 10:11:38 Not far of the mark! The original oil was destroyed and a new batch made for Elizabeth II...

6904 2018-12-24 10:11:06 It still grabs a little but w added pepper now 
Also I've been convinced to drop temps when frying, bbqing etc, pepper + help keep a crustiness happening. More this than the non-stickiness really. Helps oil spread over when baking too, true of any of the plant-based dusts tho.

6918 2018-12-24 10:07:05 There’s a new bill in congress to plant lots of hemp and cash in on cbd oil manufacturing. That’s the backdoor way of eventually legalizing it. So many in congress see turning over their $ to invest and they can taste it.
6919 2018-12-24 10:06:43 Ultimately, yes people are eating the wrong stuff,  but it is also deluded to think adding yet more highly refined seed oil combos but now with sugar replacement additives will help anything. Proper natural food of any type will.

6924 2018-12-24 10:05:41 This is once they realised Obama had hung them out to dry. In my analysis, from January 2015 (hence € QE to buy € debt) Saudi parked surplus oil proceeds in (gold-backed?) € assets eg Bunds. Unwinding Petro€ began 1st July 2017 & switch back to Petro$ completes next week

6927 2018-12-24 10:05:10 The country is poor and the mentality that our commonwealth (oil) should be shared better isn’t helpful. Hopefully, everyone will be infused with wealth creation mentality by good leaders soon.
6928 2018-12-24 10:05:06 I like Beto. Socially, he's fantastic. Economically, his voting record in congress shows he voted to help oil and gas companies. It's most definitely something any primary opponent could use against him. It'd help a lot if he pledged his support for renewable energy, I think.

7080 2018-12-24 09:42:30 He is right. Turkey has killed more than 4000 Isis terrorists before. The ones that are saying Turkey is supporting isis are big liars in order to maintain their plans continue like oil, gun sale, ideological approaches...
7081 2018-12-24 09:42:27 For the same reason petrol prices were not hiked during the crude oil boom. You can't have it both ways, either its stabilised by hedging on the price of oil at a certain point in time or freed up to follow market forces.

7086 2018-12-24 09:41:37 Yes, every country has a deficit. Very few have the deficit Scotland has. I'm sure the oil will help Scotland's economy, but even before the oil price crash, the SNP were loathe to discuss revenue vs soend outside of a specific 5-year window.

7134 2018-12-24 09:35:16 We buy oil off the Saudis because we need it, and we use them as a strategic partner because our interests align. They stop being useful, we turn our backs. I suspect that is not the relationship Corbyn and his disciples would like to forge with the likes of Venezuela.
7135 2018-12-24 09:35:11 The international oil market collapsed several years ago and that had a negative effect on Venezuela's economy as it's heavily based around selling oil. The market has recovered now though. Holy crap, if you know this little about it then why are you opining?

7161 2018-12-24 09:31:47 This is a good question, Yoram. Whoever controls the oil will sell it on the global market. As long as we’re not going to profit from that, does it matter who’s doing the selling? 

What alternative would you suggest? We build a DMZ on Syria’s border with Turkey?
7162 2018-12-24 09:31:26 Arggh!  Huge sympathies!

First Christmas after we married, had no heating or hot water. Fortunately an open fire saved the day.

A couple of years ago at the coldest snap our heating here broke: 11 days. We bought 3 oil filled radiators, to keep core rooms warm. Good standby.

So dont be a dick. If you cant stand something, either quit or suck up and learn to live with it.

7233 2018-12-24 09:21:18 As per Cassaredi, economics is not science. It is not art. It is a poor stepchild of math, or claims to be, and works at being an interpretation of history. Economist are snake oil salespeople working hard to justify their salary.

7313 2018-12-24 09:07:35 Large ships use the worst kind of oil and tar to run their engines. In Hamburg they must use normal oil to enter the harbour.

If they don’t, all the expensive houses along the Elbe have huge flakes of burnt tar all over the garden. No way of hiding

7486 2018-12-24 08:37:54 We disagree slightly here. The "Kamala was a cop" argument doesn't have legs. The oil interests to Beto were private Texas owned companies that can be explained away. But drug costs are a very real and solid kitchen table issue. And a super touchy one at that.

7592 2018-12-24 08:17:43 More seriously, the NBC piece is a rehash with an added "the Russians did it" spin. That leaves me wondering if the Syria withdrawal didn't prompt that. The pundits are *mad* about that but of course they can't just say "Donald is messing up our oil wars".

7620 2018-12-24 08:13:02 There is nothing positive about global oil demand increasing... it means emissions have increased, pollution has increased, air quality is worse & climate impacts are getting harder to mitigate! We need to transition to sustainable, clean energy.

7627 2018-12-24 08:12:09 $200 is BIG Donations? LOL! How hypocritical are the mental gymnastics of  @BetoORourke fans trying to justify his Big Oil donations as "individual" & he got over $400K. It's ludicrous, shallow and immaterial that you're trying to equate that to $200 #SMH

7629 2018-12-24 08:11:55 Deregulating Wall Street, fast tracking trade deals that kill American jobs, and voting in favor of Big Oil are not areas I want cooperation with the other side.  These things matter outside of the paradigms of left and right, they have real world consequences.

7631 2018-12-24 08:11:53 there's no other way though. The environment is doomed if we think policy makers will do anything about it too, so there's no real work around. Oil companies pay for the politicians too

We would just look at his policy and votes from the beginning. He voted to gut regulations on Wall Street.  he wanted to fast-track the TPP.  he's against medicare-for-all accepts oil donors, and he votes Republican 60+% of the time
7646 2018-12-24 08:09:16 Sorry, you think she didn't run on a moon-shot climate plan in 2016 because of the %0.15 of donations she got from people at least passingly associated with the oil industry?

7659 2018-12-24 08:08:19 Okay, one, no one can "stop" global warming, not at this point. Two, slowing growth of oil production would be a positive step -- not near as much as many would like, but still positive. Thus do hyperbole and bad math skills combine to canonize impossible utopian objectives.

7701 2018-12-24 08:01:17 Sustainable palm oil is possible. But currently, I highly doubt that any companies are fully sustainable and for that reason, I would advocate avoiding palm oil completely. However, because of the yield and potential benefits of palm oil, it can be produced in a sustainable way.

7766 2018-12-24 07:51:03 @NigeriainfoFM The problem always affecting the budget of Nigeria is over reliance on oil for funding it, we were all lied to by this government that other sectors of the economy can sustain us now the 2019 budget is still to be largely funded by oil. Too bad. #MorningCrossfire
7767 2018-12-24 07:51:03 They’re weaker b/c of competition. City backed by a (wealthy oil) state, CFC established as one of the richest clubs in the world now still half funded by oil, United generating crazy £ compared to early 2000s, AFC funds are stable now. LFC financially backed.

7792 2018-12-24 07:46:15 So the breakdown for those who haven't listened to #showstomper is if @JonnyBones injected the PED 18 months ago it would be oil based and it'd make sense for it to stay around like this. Not so if this was a water based (oral) supplement ie a mistaken ingestion. @eugeneSrobinson
7793 2018-12-24 07:46:04 Individuals that work in oil/gas gave to Beto. It’s like saying because individuals from car companies gave a large portion the auto industry as a corporate pac gave. There’s a lot of everyday people that work in oil/gas in Texas.

7795 2018-12-24 07:45:27 They say its individual donors from employees of oil and gas companies. Wonder what these employees get paid to pollute the crap out of the gulf of Mexico? Or the rivers 
7796 2018-12-24 07:45:26 They'll rather give oil marketers
7797 2018-12-24 07:45:25 The oil companies support the carbon dividend. The simplicity and clarity over the current regulatory regime is worth it to them.

7848 2018-12-24 07:37:42 As long as oil is denominated in dollars, we'll be okay. I wrote two years ago that a big goal of Xi & Putin is displacing the dollar as the Global Reserve Currency & that Fat-45 would assist if he was "elected."  Queue sad trombone
7849 2018-12-24 07:37:01 Luddite Trump ... investing in  coal, oil and walls

Meanwhile the rest of the world is investing & LEADING in future technologies: drones, wind, solar, electric cars

7852 2018-12-24 07:36:17 How much are we spending on Corporate Welfare?  Just asking cuz the amount I heard was so outrageous I couldn't believe it.  Why does Wal-Mart need us to give them our tax dollars, or Shell Oil, the list is really, really long.  How much does it cost us?

7858 2018-12-24 07:35:50 People have been pointing explicitly to bad votes that he took regarding the oil industry. 

That's why there is a there here, because there is money, and there are votes that give the appearance of corruption, and votes that don't make sense in the context of climate change.

7863 2018-12-24 07:35:18 But seriously my mom found a recipe on line for smashed Brussels sprouts where you roast me in the oven with some cheese and oil and Garlic and it is  the best.
7864 2018-12-24 07:34:43 im so out of it that i cracked my egg into the frying pan without any oil (it burnt afterwards but the egg is edible) and I also poured a cup of moscato for myself half an hour after waking up lmao
7865 2018-12-24 07:34:33 Maybe let Hussein keep the Kuwaiti oil. That’s an interesting counter timeline, much better than what if nazis ruled America.

7867 2018-12-24 07:34:06 If Media would have interviewed truck rally drivers they would have found out that hardly any driver was unemployed. All of them were driving truck provided for work. Yes, oil prices are down and profit is down but unemployment is not as bad as Conservatives are trying claim.
7868 2018-12-24 07:34:05 No.  Those were decades-old oil smuggling networks where smugglers arbitraged price discrepancies in the region.  Daesh took them over to extort the smugglers.  However, the routes extended well outside of Daesh territory.  Assad and even the FSA acquired oil from them.
7869 2018-12-24 07:33:42 Also: "He praised natural gas in October, calling its production “a great job opportunity and an environmentally responsible opportunity.” In a debate with Cruz, he said that choosing between oil and renewable energy would be a “false choice.”"
7870 2018-12-24 07:33:39 Bake them in the oven with oil, garlic, and cheese and every veg is to die for~
7871 2018-12-24 07:33:31 Read the Post piece. 

If Beto voted poorly, people should know that and vote accordingly. If Sanders partisans are going to call a Texan corrupt for taking a tiny % of donations from oil execs, that road leads places none of us want to go.

7884 2018-12-24 07:32:03 Also: "In 2015, he joined most House Republicans and 25 Democrats by voting against the oil export ban. The following year, he voted against an amendment that would have prohibited funding for offshore drilling research in the Gulf of Mexico."

7893 2018-12-24 07:29:54 Good read. As I retrospect, I'm affirmative that I suffer from the distraction disorder at work day in, day out ending up doing productive stuff either when no human's around or at home(burning the night oil).
7894 2018-12-24 07:29:44 The Comfort Aromatherapy from BBW is amazing. The scent is beautiful. I bought their body oil and body wash/foam bath and it makes me feel powerful as fuck when I use it
7895 2018-12-24 07:29:35 Too much oil for your brain bro...

It's that rejection majority can't swallow well and decides to point finger instead of chopping the L in peace.
7896 2018-12-24 07:29:02 "there appears to be a concerted effort from the Bernie Sanders camp to paint O'Rourke as a tool of the oil and gas industry..." Nah man leftists just have a moral compass that allows different people to arrive at similar conclusions over a similar timespan

7898 2018-12-24 07:28:40 In the last 24 hrs there were a total of 6 oil product tankers in the ports of Quebec City and Montreal. Yet according to Quebec Premier François Legault, there is no social acceptability for oil in Quebec.

7905 2018-12-24 07:27:30 Buhari reformed agriculture but local rice is still #21,000. 

He reformed oil industry but fuel is #147 and we still pay subsidy.

He fought corruption but babachir and akpabio are eating with him.

He tackled insecurity but killings in zamfara, kaduna and benue has increased.

7917 2018-12-24 07:25:22 I like to use plain aloe gel (no scents or dyes) and mix in a couple drops of Rosehip oil. I just use it as a moisturizer after washing my face :) or you could just use the rosehip oil by itself!

7919 2018-12-24 07:25:11 I don’t have access to the source file @alexkotch, can you remove the PAC contributions and create the same chart?  There’s been a claim that naturally @BetoORourke individual contributions would come from oil industry folks.  He lives in an oil industry state.
7920 2018-12-24 07:24:46 And this proves what, exactly? Setting of pump prices for fuel should be a "free market" decision left to the oil companies. Why should the federal govt 'interfere' with price controls, subsidies & esoteric formulas?.. @MOTMalaysia @anthonyloke @guanenglim
7921 2018-12-24 07:24:40 Well if that's how you feel fam, sometimes too much baby oil is too much. I ain't hating I'm just suggesting...

7926 2018-12-24 07:23:24 At this point though we are oversold imo. Won't be looking for a weekly trend change, but I think we will see choppy action with a slight upside bias, similar to oil's action between $50-$54 before next leg down. Companies like AAPL are way too appealing at current prices

7941 2018-12-24 07:20:51 I also compare with other countries in similar situations. How pragmatic are your expectations?

Any govt confronted by severe revenue issues: oil price drop, pipeline sabotage and weak production base has limited options in short term decisions.
Be real!
7942 2018-12-24 07:20:50 I recommend bandaging your finger with an olive oil soaked rag. The fats from the oil will keep the wound moist, which gives it proper conditions to heal, and will minimise the chance of scarring

7951 2018-12-24 07:19:29 In case you didn't notice, ISIS thrived, while Obama bombed empty desert.  As soon as the Russians arrived and blew up all the ISIS convoys running stolen Syrian oil out through Turkey, it was game over for the globalists' proxy fighters and their lying "White Helmet" terrorists.

7969 2018-12-24 07:17:15 There is a difference between corporate PAC money and individual donations from people who work in an industry. A lot of Texans work in oil and gas, so it should surprise no one that 0.6% of O'Rourke's donations came from people employed in that sector.
7970 2018-12-24 07:17:09 I literally have oil for baking so it's in the fridge but it hardened into butter. I tried asking someone else but he was too high to understand

7981 2018-12-24 07:14:53 Agree. Unless it’s some manufactured, bullshit story that is nothing more than some numbers taken out of context. Like beto’s supposed donations from the oil industry. Just total garbage, but that’s how Bernie’s supporters play. You have to understand that going in.

7987 2018-12-24 07:14:09 Only spent a week or so in Croatia with close Croatian friends, but I loved how every person I met would tell me their homemade wine / olive oil / goat was better than their neighbours / friends / family members equivalent. It was all delicious & the hospitality unforgettable : )
7988 2018-12-24 07:13:58 But don't those regimes need some good ol American "freedom" so you can rape them for oil in the name of "peace keeping"?

8009 2018-12-24 07:10:27 As our dependence for intl crude wanes, it’s definitely not in our interest to continue wasting men, women and treasure.

Oil independence (which includes drilling in places like ANWR) will allow us to not rely on the Middle East. Industrialized nations have allowed...

8014 2018-12-24 07:09:58 Yeah, that's common knowledge. The problem here is that the lobbists who are pushing hard for more capacity in a world already in an oil glut is after other things. Mostly, IMO, to move the cons into power so they can grift like Trump. What other reason could there be?

8024 2018-12-24 07:07:35 And you are making the same big mistake with Iran, by re-imposing sanctions on them. The end game, which is already happening, is that China and Russia will form closer links with them. And it's not preventing China or India buying oil from them.

Hi all
I am an Egyptian Geologist, working in the oil field science 2007. 
Actually, I love the research and academic work very much. I searched for a PH.D position since I had my master degree(2015), but unfortunately I found nothing........(continued)
8041 2018-12-24 07:03:36 Have you ever had chili oil? A spoon full will certainly wake you up...! Or knock you down.
8042 2018-12-24 07:03:31 Kalo udah pake cleansing oil tapi masih pake micellar boleh nggak sih? Biar mantep aja bersihnya wkwk
8043 2018-12-24 07:03:08 Oil is oil... can't hurt to try.
8044 2018-12-24 07:02:24 Not just individual money but look at his big donors from the oil industry. These people we're giving the maximum amount..... So it was the CEO' and others that are racking in the dough.....then look at his VOTING record on oil issues.
8045 2018-12-24 07:02:19 Let's look at this: The missing context: O'Rourke didn't take money from corporate political action committees, and the donations attributed to the oil and gas business include both a handful from executives and many others from lower-level employees of his home state's...

8048 2018-12-24 07:01:30 Fresh shower and coconut oil >>>>
8049 2018-12-24 07:01:24 So, you're saying Trump supporters are, for the time being, 100 times as likely to give their money to grifters selling snake oil? Because that seems about right.
8050 2018-12-24 07:01:10 God Damn hypocrite .... support Alberta oil
8051 2018-12-24 07:01:09 Everyone requires oil - its denial. JT is in Mali right now; he told McKenna he was flying there in an Electric plane  - mckenna is like... "wow!"

8056 2018-12-24 07:00:21 Thanks bro, and God bless. I need the 5k to buy groundnut oil for myself and a friend of mine. The money will go a long way to put smile on our faces for this Christmas.
8057 2018-12-24 07:00:06 I always forget to oil my hair
8058 2018-12-24 07:00:02 I guess the wannabe priests don't know that their archbishop trades oil well for the GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra. TRUTH is SUPREME.
8059 2018-12-24 07:00:01 I been sleep off that oil since this morning 
8060 2018-12-24 06:59:53 the hair is different so i wasn’t sure but the nose oil is the same
8061 2018-12-24 06:59:49 Exactly, we need to Wall Street Dems too. One thing I like about O'Rourke is that he doesn't take PAC money. However, he still broke his pledge with the oil execs showering as much as they could on him.
8062 2018-12-24 06:59:33 Coconut oil and baby oil is the best combo
8063 2018-12-24 06:59:07 yesterday i couldn't find my makeup because i never use it so i took oil paint and put it on my eyelids
8064 2018-12-24 06:59:02 Magic and Pelinka have made some horrible moves. Ball pick thanks to his snake oil salesman father the kid is one of worst draft picks in Laker history.

8067 2018-12-24 06:58:18 Bingo. If we don't get tRUmp et al out, the aggression on vulnerable countries by Putin will tsunami. He needs oil and gas routes/money to survive. The need to launder money is because rubles don't help.
And tRUmp will antagonize the situation.
8068 2018-12-24 06:58:17 I need my neutragena oil & a scrub cause my skin been so rough since I ran out of it.

8073 2018-12-24 06:57:57 He represents one of the largest oil/gas producing states in the nation. It is up to voters to decide in light of his entire record, his personality, his skills, his accomplishments, and his platform whether he's too conservative or not up for the job.

เห้ยยยยย...  จะไหวไหมเนี้ยกู!!!
8083 2018-12-24 06:55:43 Do you actually believe all those people that work in the oil industry gave him money to support a green new deal (essentially putting them out of a job) or more fracking?     
8084 2018-12-24 06:55:36 Aku pake baby oil karena lebih mudah bersihin makeup dan Alhamdulillah gak ada efek lain
8085 2018-12-24 06:55:26 おかげさまで本日は満席となりました！

8087 2018-12-24 06:55:21 Hard to believe this is what we are supposed to respect and to argue is what we need to do to earn money. On the same basis we might as well fish with dynamite or park oil rigs off all of our pristine beaches.
8088 2018-12-24 06:55:14 Erdogans family was involved in buying oil from IS. 

This is a betrayal against loyal kurds who are the ones taking the fight on the ground with IS.
8089 2018-12-24 06:55:11 Yeah Zippo oil basically diesel I think, you can get that online or from any supermarket
8090 2018-12-24 06:55:07 Mayo over like... Coconut oil or conditioner? What forbidden hair care knowledge am I lacking?
8091 2018-12-24 06:54:56 かわいい
8092 2018-12-24 06:54:48 False. The US debt is sustainable. The economy could slow down a bit but there won't be recession. Next year will see greater US exports led by oil. Due to tariffs, China will import more from US. Also more infrastructural spending. Disengagement from foreign wars = savings
8093 2018-12-24 06:54:42 Plans for this holiday season:
December 24th - work. 
December 25th - brakes and oil change on car.
December 26th-28th - work some more. 
December 29th & the 30th - read and play.

8099 2018-12-24 06:53:32 The article says he received around $11K Is that what you use for a "gotcha" moment? When contributions from Big Oil to @BetoORourke are mentioned, ppl do mental gymnastics to excuse him, & they're in the 100Ks. Hypocritical!

8100 2018-12-24 06:53:32 It was christening oil.
8101 2018-12-24 06:53:29 @EdmontonOilers Puljujarvi’s turnover (and lazy reach for the puck) cost our team a major shift in momentum against Tampa last night. Send him down before we ruin this kid’s future with the Oil. Please reunite D. Strome with McDavid - some serious changes are needed in Oil town.
8102 2018-12-24 06:53:27 Both of them need some serious help
8103 2018-12-24 06:53:24 If #DXY has peaked, one of the many commodities likely to benefit in the short-term is #WTI. I expect Oil to rally with stocks. We've tagged key support in 45s here, now going higher?
8104 2018-12-24 06:53:19 On a serious note,if you search for this on google, you should be able to get what he does... But I know he is into several businesses, I know he owns 5 star music, I think he is into oil and gas ( and supported Kaycee's importation business too (Furniture/interior biz)
8105 2018-12-24 06:53:13 Everyone shouting for harmattan, hope you guys are happy now?

Stay hydrated this season. Drink a lot of water.

You need more of oils now then before. Body oil, hair oil, etc.

In case of any cut, accident or Injury go to the hospital. Tetanus is dangerous.
8106 2018-12-24 06:53:03 And when oil and gas company money is given - you think it’s because he’s in favor of moving to green energy? That’s how corporations purchase a candidate - they tell their people which candidate is “best for the future of our company” and then the people write a personal check.
8107 2018-12-24 06:52:58 You are right with your observations about the dress.. Your problem is emotional intelligence though. You should just have gone to put a few palm oil stains on it behind her back and you would have needed to give her no reason not to wear the dress.
8108 2018-12-24 06:52:55 i put this baby’s oil thingy on my tummy bc my tummy’s been acting up lately and oh my god I SMELL LIKE A BABY

She would'nt have killed a movement sponsored by someone over criticism or it affecting her personal bank account (new green initiative), the way Pelosi did for BIG OIL
8122 2018-12-24 06:51:37 "we should go in and take the oil" of Iraq, you said.
8123 2018-12-24 06:51:25 Hahah oraaayt, sweet and sour pala yurn. Nasa isip ko chicken oil HAHHAHAHAHAHA charot 
8124 2018-12-24 06:51:22 Chefs, the ingredients for the dessert round are: 
 
 Duck-billed platypus eggs, 
 A jug of canola oil, 
 Popped popcorn, 
 and sesame oil 
 
 Time starts now.
8125 2018-12-24 06:51:13 1 cheaper fertiliser led to increased agro output, larger contribution of non oil sector to gdp, employment in blending plants
2 More Nigeria made products in major supermarkets
3 increased foreign reserves
4 drop in foreign rice import
Clearly you don't understand economics
8126 2018-12-24 06:51:00 My hair is really out here growing.. & I’d personally like to thank Water, deep conditioning & olive oil
8127 2018-12-24 06:50:57 OIL
8128 2018-12-24 06:50:56 Sir, can I dm?
8129 2018-12-24 06:50:47 Wtf is he wearing? Clown pants, yellow teeth and flat yellow cotton candy hair. He’s John Wayne Gacy days before the bodies were found. He’s literally a clown who got an upgrade to carnival barker because he needed extra cash because the snake oil salesman gig dried up. #FatNixon
8130 2018-12-24 06:50:44 When cooking pasta, add salt to the water when it's already hot so that it won't take longer to boil. Never ever add oil. The pasta will not absorb the sauce.
8131 2018-12-24 06:50:44 And if they aren't profitable what will happen?
TZ government will extend help for 10, 15, 20 years while managers write reports about unforeseen global travel environment: oil price, terrorism, war in neighboring country, Ebola, etc.
Managers will die rich, TZ taxpayers poorer.
8132 2018-12-24 06:50:33 You are an absolute fool if you believe Erdogan will eradicate ISIS. He is after the PKK and will do anything to achieve their destruction. The minute PKK opposition is destroyed he will annex all the Kurd lands and the attendant oil fields as his spoils of war. #NeverTrump

8136 2018-12-24 06:49:45 We talk about data being the new oil.But we don’t act on capitalising the wealth. Useful commercial use of data can be a game changer for industrial prospects in India, particularly for SMEs. The #Amazon initiative in this regard is noteworthy.

8139 2018-12-24 06:48:58 I like Arab people in Spain (it makes sense only in my country)
The Román Church expelled them from Spain and they eventually came back with OIL to Madrid.
Clever guys.
8140 2018-12-24 06:48:37 God save us. It looks like we don't have brilliant people in our security outfits. I think it's high time we attracts First Class students to the police, military, DSS, Senate's etc instead of oil companies and other bluechips company.
8141 2018-12-24 06:48:05 Hmmmm kayanya ga se bagus fix+ tp mendekati ini ngeset nya bagus banget dan ngehold oil lumayan. Aku pake 5 jam ga keluar oil samsek padahal biasanya udah keluar sedikit2

8150 2018-12-24 06:46:50 Sir, I don't get it, are they ones producing the oil, or they want to go on another killing spree of those producing it? Cause I don't get. The last time I checked they are cow sellers. I know you are being sarcastic Sir.

8155 2018-12-24 06:46:08 The US would be wise to invest in developing liquid storage tech, converting some of the 2/3 of Nevada that it owns into a solar farm, and producing clean liquid energy in bulk. Then push to distribute it through the oil channels we have and reestablish American energy dominance.
8156 2018-12-24 06:46:02 U and prev admins should have never been involved in middle east! Leave them alone and let them figure out how to live together peacefully, but oil and competing with Russia and China now always keeps us involved there and we keep losing young men and women there. No one cares

8158 2018-12-24 06:45:41 Lol are you fucking kidding me? He voted against the party 167 times in D+17 district. He always voted in favor of Oil and Wall St. He voted against the party on several immigration issues despite his district being primarily Hispanic. For a Dem he couldn’t be more conservative.
8159 2018-12-24 06:45:40 I think when you fight with obesity, mct oil is not a good deal, oil is oil and means fat calories.weight loss process is a high load on your detoxification organs. Fat stores the toxins, and during the weight loss you get all the toxins in your blood. Eliminate toxics. #fxmayr

8161 2018-12-24 06:45:19 Merry Christmas Eve, everybody! The bottom seam of the 20L can of high grade olive oil has rusted through and leaked all over the pantry, so we're now doing a last-minute kamikaze Kmart run to buy a 20L automotive oil can.

I mean, the list of countries willing to aid+abet ISIS selling oil was next to 0. Except... Turkey! You're just letting Erdogan return to helping ol' ISIS out, b/c ALL he cares about are Kurds
8165 2018-12-24 06:45:01 This is just for conventional oil but they have coupons for synthetic oil too! Download the Shop Your Way app and you’ll find a coupon forsure

8168 2018-12-24 06:44:44 It’s a big mistake to trust this guy. Why should he end ISIS he was their helping hand and the main importer of the stolen Syrian crude oil at chesp rates. Do you trust him with your allies the Kurds his enemies. This guy is hearless President and he will smash the Kurds first.
8169 2018-12-24 06:44:39 You’ll think I’m a conspiracy theorist but the rational has been over a foreign policy nightmare of making terrorism the new Cold War perpetrated endless profits for the war machine that’s protecting Israel, oil, trade routes, finance and geographic expansion.

8172 2018-12-24 06:44:30 You're just repeating warmonger neocon talking points.

1. The Kurds were selling oil to Assad. 
2. ISIS was created by Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

 How would u center the budget on 2.3m barrel/day when OPEC has reduced our production to less than 2m. The oil market has fallen in Q4
How do u intend to achieve $60/barrel when its currently sold at $45/barrel

So the same Erdogan who enabled ISIS's rise by funneling their oil now will fight them?

8193 2018-12-24 06:41:15 There was a time, long ago, when we used whale oil for lubrication.
After that became unfashionable, we used ground-up wolf heads.
Now, we use synthetic petrolium.
That canister is clearly from a bygone age.

#ModiAasuchanti
8196 2018-12-24 06:41:00 Because we didnt pay more when the oil price increased. Thats why. Right now we pays rm2.20/L. If price reduced, we should pay less about rm0.30/L. But remember we should pay rm0.40/L more of the gov didnt stabilize the petrol price months back.
8197 2018-12-24 06:40:51 7/10 Rafizi talks about OIL pricing.
Malaysian are not complaining about OIL but Melayu/Cina/India / Discrimination / Hilang  kuasa/ Mentri bodoh/Guling here and there/ Temples and so on. Maybe  OPEC  Can appoint him as their  PETROLEUM MINISTER.

8204 2018-12-24 06:39:55 It is sad you think people do not have an ounce of compassion for them, of course we do, just like down east fisheries, GM workers, shipyard workers, coal miners! No one has moved the goal post, oil prices dropped, regulations stop you from getting cancer.

8220 2018-12-24 06:38:13 That pie chart does not tell you what drives the economy. I’m sure oil and gas drives a fairly large part of “real estate” portion for example. It doesn’t tell you which parts of total GDP are dependent on oil and gas to successfully monetize other sectors of the economy.

8243 2018-12-24 06:35:17 We like our homes “pucca”. But cement has shit thermal qualities. So our homes require consistent heating/cooling. And the energy for these homes comes from fossil fuels (furnace oil, coal).
8244 2018-12-24 06:35:12 No dictator is ever better over the long term...and blaming Clinton alone for the US actions is rather juvenile in my view.   Lets face it - the West WANTS middle eastern countries to use up the oil wealth with infighting rather than them spending it mischief externally.

8258 2018-12-24 06:32:31 Have you read the Lisbon Treaty - In 2022 we’d become an EU state, & have to give up our currency, sovereignty, nationality. No more Queen or King.

8297 2018-12-24 06:25:44 And with low oil if there really is a pivot to some sort of "safe" asset then the miners that aren't hedged really could stand to profit very well. At the very least they shouldn't crash terribly if oil is down so much. Iinm.

8305 2018-12-24 06:24:03 2/ in 08 most commodities saw huge inflows. I doubt oil will see that again because we've moved beyond peak oil. That means foodstuffs likely won't be impacted much either as ethanol is less important. But gold and silver seem cheap despite increased cost of carry.

8402 2018-12-24 06:11:34 Then, please, explain selling our national parks to oil companies. Which, they are likely to wreck in search of oil and natural gas. Thus wrecking our tourism industry. Which is one of the big selling points of the US. While also hurting us in the process. Can you defend that?

He kill Kurds, your allied helpers.
He buy the oil from ISIS and help them to come through borders.
He arranged the fake push to eliminate his political enemies & critical voices.

You give him support to keep going this dictators way.

8419 2018-12-24 06:10:00 Crude oil prices came down knocking the commodity cycle down in general. He got lucky. Terrorist attacks, particularly in J&K have gone up. What's left? Also, shouldn't performance be measured against objectives? Basic principles of appraisal?

8427 2018-12-24 06:09:11 Erdogan created ISIS and gave them weapons and money and they were treated in Turkish hospitals. He even bought oil from them.
8428 2018-12-24 06:09:06 โอ้ยใจนี่  
8429 2018-12-24 06:09:04 What the rakyat wants is lower petrol price when world oil price goes down. But never wants price increased when world oil price goes up. To me, remove subsidies and build more hospitals.
8430 2018-12-24 06:09:04 I need a oil pen bro this weed so damn saucey folks shit really give me a fuckin headache and attitude
8431 2018-12-24 06:09:02 Don't believe Erdogan. His criminal family exploited and funded ISIS to fence oil from surrounding countries through Turkey into Israel to be processed for resale. US occupation obviously was never intended to address this problem, instead they likely helped big oil participate.

8440 2018-12-24 06:07:38 how does beto's bad voting record or taking big oil money make him a threat to bernie?
8441 2018-12-24 06:07:34 Pls exercise caution if it’s burning. Peppermint oil, along w tea tree oil, is highly astringent to the point that it can burn your skin if you aren’t careful
8442 2018-12-24 06:07:08 “She’ll sleep like an oil,” “I’m dysclexic,” and “is that you’re out-ro” all phrases in the last two minutes by @oh_kayeee.
8443 2018-12-24 06:06:50 So does anyone else have that one item you always think you're out of, so you buy more, but you're never actually out of it, so you have tons? Mine is sesame oil. Worse, the bottles are getting progressively bigger. At this rate I'll be buying the 50 gal drum by March.
8444 2018-12-24 06:06:42 If you see anyone doing this call them out. It’s not play time and it’s disinformation to imply Beto took money from Big Oil. Flat lies. He only took money from ppl, no pacs. He’s not even my # 1 pick but lies are lies & we will NOT repeat 2016. Stop the bs. #BlueWave2020
8445 2018-12-24 06:06:38 The name of Jesus is also all-powerful to fill the heart with joy; it is compared to oil (Cant. i. 2); as oil gives light, alleviates pain, and affords nourishment, so does the name of Jesus, when we call upon it.

8447 2018-12-24 06:06:26 I like the idea of discussing all these things in the primaries and really finding the best candidate and ideas. But not if people are gonna argue in bad faith and say things like Beto “took money from big oil and gas.” We already know that’s false. They should do better.

8476 2018-12-24 06:02:41 Yeah the Peshmerga in the Kurds they wants to slaughter them both. Let's see how quickly Russia mercenaries move across the Euphrates to take the oil field did we slaughtered them over on Mattis order.

8493 2018-12-24 05:59:26 A third world country struggling with a dictatorship called Venezuela. We have more oil than the whole middle east but hey, we're still poor as fuck.
8494 2018-12-24 05:59:19 If we had a healthy oil and gas industry there would be lots of money for affordable housing. It’s pretty sad when a hospital in Alberta,  Grand Prairie takes this many years to complete. People are dying. Fix this!
8495 2018-12-24 05:59:14 What matters most is what he’s doing now, and he’s putting his money where his mouth is with no pac money. Employees that work at oil companies donating to him individually is NOT BIG OIL and it’s disgusting to say it is. He only took money from people. We will NOT repeat 2016.

After two years of empty squee over her emails, the Clinton Foundation and now Beto’s oil donations, all of it hyperbolic and badly manicured for political effect,  I finally had enough and blocked him. Last tweet was the one about Dems preferring to ruin climate. Done.
8499 2018-12-24 05:58:14 And you believe him? Didn’t he tell you that he was buying the oil from ISIS when they were occupied part of syria?

8508 2018-12-24 05:57:17 Turkey supported ISIS, provided supplies, purchased stolen oil, allowed porous boarders for terrorists, even had hospitals for injured ISIS fighters in Turkey To suggest they will finish off ISIS is absurd. You’re responsible for the failure to defeat ISIS you fool

8510 2018-12-24 05:56:32 So his votes to expand off-shore oil drilling, lift the oil export ban and his lack of for support for any Medicare-For-All legislation which is currently supported by 70%+ of Americans including a majority of Republicans is more in tune with the country?

8512 2018-12-24 05:56:19 By that logic we should have left Hitler alone to get on with it. The Iraq war was a @GOP oil grab and yes wrong but then @gop is the party of greed. The last chemical attack by Assad in Syria was in September. You’re not fooling anyone - putin puppet
8513 2018-12-24 05:56:01 Are you telling me the Middle East has nothing to do with oil?!? Yemen with famine has nothing to do with oil. Yup I’m talking to smartest man alive. Should I bow in your presence or do you prefer cash donations?
8514 2018-12-24 05:55:58 "Money from the oil industry" means donations from anybody who works for the "oil industry" in any capacity. Beto did well with those people because he raised more money than anyone else in general, mostly from within a state where the oil industry is an enormous employer

My Blepharitis has gotten worse, limiting activities so on advice of friend using Cannabis oil for her MS I’m trying it. Go online, click and postie comes with package two days later. Early days but so far there’s some relief.
8524 2018-12-24 05:53:58 None of them, that’s the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won’t come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn’t impress anybody around here.

8531 2018-12-24 05:53:20 Sirota did a mediocre job by his usually higher standards of reporting about oil and gas industry donors to Beto, who is from TEXAS, a state with a massive oil industry, where he got mostly funds from workers, and a CEO@here and there for 0.5% of his donations.
8532 2018-12-24 05:53:08 Yes that it so true. I know the Oil and Gas companies have been quietly working Research and Development. Reasonably priced  green energy has not been invented in affordable houses. I know a young PHD candidate who’s mission it is to prove Fracking doesn’t ruin the environment
8533 2018-12-24 05:52:47 What you use? I just fw Shea moisturizer and some olive oil
8534 2018-12-24 05:52:44 どこへ
8535 2018-12-24 05:52:35 Because they are not selling cheap oil to him anymore!!!
Smart erdogan tactics
8536 2018-12-24 05:52:08 (To clarify: the same figurative crowd as sane conservatives. The actual group of yellow vest dudes did not seem sane, reasonable, or even mostly interested in oil issues.
Seemed real worked up about the UN and brown people migrating, though)

8540 2018-12-24 05:51:28 How many freaken people are getting rich off the war in Syria? All these so called liberals freaking out at Trump ended our participation in a war. It was our influence and dollars pouring into the middle east for their oil that caused the rise of terrorism. We used to know that.
8541 2018-12-24 05:51:25 Like canadian oil instead of importing middle east oil ? Hypocrites

8546 2018-12-24 05:50:54 No. Canadians and albertans work together to solve probs. Current oil crisis is just beginning of challenges we are all going to face. Independent AB won’t get pipeline passed either
8547 2018-12-24 05:50:49 Yep. But more important they are pulling out liquidity so there is less money on the street for loans and business expansion.  Home loans and car loans will dry up soon. There is not even 2% inflation excluding oil. If you factor in oil there is negative inflation. DEEP STATE!

8562 2018-12-24 05:48:42 That was the most hypocritical thing I’ve ever seen. They want the white man’s pickup trucks and outboard motors and electricity, but they don’t want to contribute to the oil that powers those things.

8577 2018-12-24 05:47:16 Is that to drink?and your warming it up to a devilish temperature or is it naughty time with body oil

8581 2018-12-24 05:46:41 Othen you ride your bike with a rusty chain and no rubber tires and hitchhike everywhere then.  And yes we make a living in the oil and gas as do millions of others. Just the other day some of your scientists have said the ozone is now closing to fast.  Hard to know who’s right.

8585 2018-12-24 05:46:31 The neolibs are desperate to find a candidate to kneecap Bernie. You thought Beto was the one, but it came out wonderboy voted against Dems 137 w/ the GOP & was the #2 recipient of oil & gas $. Beto said it’s a false choice to choose between fossil fuels & renewables. #NeverBeto
8586 2018-12-24 05:46:31 That's not exactly a balanced article. In any case, Beto doesn't have a great env voting record. In a week where I saw Obama bragging about record oil drilling during his term, I don't want to fall for another inspirational "progressive"  candidate who sides with Wall Street

8592 2018-12-24 05:46:06 He literally had his name pulled from the no fossil fuel money pledge. It's not just blue collar workers giving small donations, it was oil and gas execs giving him max donations. There's a difference.

8604 2018-12-24 05:44:45 This is a shitty take. A politician in a state or district where oil is a major industry needs to protect that industry to keep his job. People want reassurance that if they vote for you, they won’t lose their jobs. Duh. Context ought to matter when analyzing votes.

8614 2018-12-24 05:43:50 Pussy juice was once sold as a cure all by snake oil salesman at medicine shows in the late 1800s. Susie the squirter would perform her routine and a lucky person in the audience would get shots of pussy juice for free. My great grandma is a legend in some parts lol 
8615 2018-12-24 05:43:34 Literally the only thing his detractors have to attack him with is his past long ago employment with Bernie.

Why not talk about Beth's voting record? Or the fact he takes oil exec $ when he said he wouldn't? Too inconvenient and uncomfortable so just ignore it.
8616 2018-12-24 05:43:33 Pallets of cash are spent - we are the oil exporter- their monies are not there
8617 2018-12-24 05:43:30 First of, completely lay off tans, cosmetic surgery &  makeup, then watch your diet. Replace makeup with olive oil/coconut oil (this one works wonders on the skin). Finally when you've 'detoxed' start whichever medication you'll be recommended.

8619 2018-12-24 05:43:13 Mike do your homework.  Toothpaste and candy are not the cause of this.  The Indonesian government has mandated palm oil in diesel fuel.  That is what spiked demand and caused this.
8620 2018-12-24 05:43:10 hahahaha sana oil
8621 2018-12-24 05:43:06 I’m saying that when oil is a quarter of you’re GDP, it pays for the safety net. 

When you remove so much of your revenue from the stream, you have to replace it (underpants gnomes), or you sacrifice spending EVERYWHERE ELSE. Or you COMPROMISE.
8622 2018-12-24 05:42:48 Low oil price leads to higher demand
8623 2018-12-24 05:42:48 Feeds the complex gives jobs keeps lobbies happy and its always a plus when its not your Kids Did I fail to mention the oil fields Turkey wants as compensation Land might be returned to Syria if it accepts Turkish bases and right to intervene. Could we say US has won either way?
8624 2018-12-24 05:42:35 Of course it’s public record. It’s also a journalists job to provide honest context.
David presented donations from FF workers in oil state as donations from from the FF industry.
He threw out the 30% number, w/o explaining O’Rourke voted with Dems 95% of the time.

8626 2018-12-24 05:42:27 The tactic is cherrypicking his record to define him on one spurious factor. Sirota is trying to color him as beholden to oil/gas even though a tiny percentage of his campaign funds come from that sector. Sirota is not interested in presenting a full, contextual profile of Beto.

8667 2018-12-24 05:37:22 Upon further inspection you're correct and I'm also impressed with how that store has 20,000 kinds of oil, half of which I have never seen
8668 2018-12-24 05:36:51 I'm sure it was just because Obama hates the Earth that oil production increased....nothing to do with the Arab spring driving up the cost of imported oil or a bipartisan bill lifting a ban on oil exports.  It's cause he's secretly a lizard person who wants a hotter Earth.
8669 2018-12-24 05:36:07 The Paradip- Hyderabad pipeline of Indian Oil Corp (IOC) pipeline soon will enable  safe, reliable, environment friendly and cost effective mode of  transportation of petroleum products.

8675 2018-12-24 05:35:36 My child just spent a day at the zoo in the rain, skipped both naps, had a paella for dinner, and a bath. There is lavender in her essential oil diffuser.
8676 2018-12-24 05:35:20 My coworker got me oil for Christmas so I showed her Riddim for Christmas 
8677 2018-12-24 05:34:44 It's misleading to ignore the issue, which is Beto's donations from oil execs & his pro-oil company votes. His donations from regular employees, like Sanders's, aren't a concern to anyone. He makes them seem the same. Misleading.
8678 2018-12-24 05:34:44 I’m about to have a beautiful shower, oil up then make me some green tea and watch a few videos..

8684 2018-12-24 05:34:03 I suppose then you take a responsibility for Obama's US involvement in Yemen? And failing to close GITMO? And the prolongation of the Syrian Civil War? And increased drone strikes? And 2.5 million deportations? And illegal intervention in Libya? And increasing US oil production?
8685 2018-12-24 05:34:01 working on an Oil Rig in the Timor Sea, have to leave my wife and kids to make this journey from home in Cork to Timor and back every 3 weeks working 3 week on 3 week off taking 8 flights and 2 helicopters per trip.. not the average 9-5 !!
8686 2018-12-24 05:34:00 You mean the Turks who supported the IS during the last year's by buying their oil and supporting them in other ways as well?
8687 2018-12-24 05:33:52 Yeah a VP in the pocket of oil and gas when climate change is the biggest problem on the horizon. I see no problem with that.

8693 2018-12-24 05:32:52 Look at Norway. They produce 3x the oil per capita Canada does, are closer to a post oil society, and have billions in savings rather than debt. 
I support diversification but see that oil can help fund it. More oil is needed by the world.

8695 2018-12-24 05:32:45 Instead of lotion tonight,  I put a stress fix composition oil all over my body after my shower. Way better than lotion. Way better 
8696 2018-12-24 05:32:39 Of course it's different. No way any oil company executives would donate to Bernie...or Walmart executives. Yet their employees would, because he's on their side. I don't think you're too stupid to understand this, no one is. You're just making pathetic, bad faith arguments.
8697 2018-12-24 05:32:37 In line with PM Modi’s vision and to boost investment in Odisha the foundation stone of Paradip- Hyderabad pipeline of Indian Oil Corp (IOC) at a cost of Rs 38 billion will be laid tomorrow.

8702 2018-12-24 05:32:08 My No.1 problem is we are scared of making sacrifice to attain greater feat. We have several sectors we could have made as sources of national financing but they believe it can only be oil.

8713 2018-12-24 05:30:56 I don't see how JustinTrudeau realizes the impact his Carbon Tax will have on us as average Canadians. And what the Federal Liberals are doing to pay out the oil industry for the damage they are causing seems to be a paltry random number.

8721 2018-12-24 05:29:41 #Oil is at it’s lowest point since June of ‘04. China stoped buying crude during the start of the trade war, along with reducing importing other goods (like soya beans from the #US). However, we see the #tariffs being halted in a truce until March 3rd ‘19...

8726 2018-12-24 05:28:57 Not on the issues, not on Beto's track record, not on Beto's ties to oil & gas during a time Climate Action has never been more urgent, not on his same old pro-Israel lobby ties that are less than promising for peace in the Middle East. No contest. #Bernie2020
8727 2018-12-24 05:28:55 Si pensas que no tenes suerte no pasa nada. Acordate que a alguien le echaron nafta en vez de gas oil en al auto y dejó a pata a la familia por segundo año consecutivo en las fiestas y se te pasa.

8729 2018-12-24 05:28:39 I normally wear that on my face but my eyeballs have been itchy so the Vaseline provides a better barrier in the corners when I finally break down and scratch. Can’t wait to go back to my “normal” routine. Coconut oil and shea butter are wonderful.

8737 2018-12-24 05:27:18 Sowell is a joke. He said Obama was like Hitler for starting a fund to help clean up the BP oil spill. He’s a global warming denier. Pro Iraq War. He claims the left pushed racial superiority, and not conservatives, ignoring history.

What an awful source example.

8740 2018-12-24 05:27:02 First, there is absolutely no organization that guarantees what you are getting is pure and safe from contaminants, unlike medical cannabis.

Second, while there is maybe 0.3% THC in help CDB oil, it's nothing that will have any effect on you unless allergic.
8741 2018-12-24 05:26:53 Ooh yes we can, where they is a will, they is a way. Isn't it a fact that  that zim is miles ahead of Singapore in terms of mineral, arable land and probably 'oil resources'. Mushandi wose ngaapihwe muripo une chiremerera...

8786 2018-12-24 05:21:22 They did say "transition", not "abandon". Those men and women need jobs that won't sink with the price of a barrel of Western Canadian Select. The only reason anyone is having this discussion is because Alberta oil isn't the job creator it used to be.

8796 2018-12-24 05:19:31 Bernie took donations of over 200 from oil and gas employees as well. Quit sniping and squabbling. Pledges like that are well intentioned but nearly impossible to uphold when you are raising the amount of money they are raising. Individual donations will fall through the cracks.

8800 2018-12-24 05:19:04 Today I went shopping for gifts for my mom and spent a good 45 minutes deciding if I wanna spend $30 on a second essential oil diffuser I found bc this one was prettier than mine even tho I 100% didn’t need it, fought w myself about it and then left w only 1 thing for my mom:)
8801 2018-12-24 05:19:01 I was in the kitchen and noticed one of Professor Mousiarty's NHL team retrobranding henchmice running under the freestanding pantry shelf. I got the glass bowl out and put some avocado oil in it and peanut butter on the rim of it. We'll see how well that does, if it does
8802 2018-12-24 05:18:55 Joi Scientific is a mature start-up company that has only 38 employees and 9 US Patents. In 2018 they partnered w/ NB Power, Marine Max and Passamquoddys American Indians in Maine. Producing clean energy below oil, coal, natural gas, nuclear has huge upside potential and watchout
8803 2018-12-24 05:18:46 I'll vote for Beto if he swears a blood oath to jail his billionaire father-in-law, nationalize and shutter oil companies, and reboot the fireside chats as a weekly agitation of class war. I'm a pragmatist at heart and hope for Dem unity.

8812 2018-12-24 05:17:30 Bu- what will change?
C- what if plastic is made out of hemp oil globally?
Bu- a new crop
C- crude oil is not needed as much
Bu- that is huge
C- we all need a way out.  I have made many ways out for people now, even mentally
Bu- trying to get a herd to follow
C- yes
8813 2018-12-24 05:17:26 sirota is trash but the number of people who blindly followed beto without knowing the most basic of information about him is depressing

all texas politicians are going to have a shady history re: oil money and corporatis votes. it isn't sacrilege to bring that up!

8817 2018-12-24 05:16:42 Mandate? Throw out the rule of law? Make Justin Emperor / King of Canada? Do that for jobs? No. Follow the law, find a plan that meets environmental concerns and realize that even if all 3 pipelines are built the old oil patch is gone. Many need to re-aim their career & retrain
8818 2018-12-24 05:16:39 The coconut oil could help keep your energy up. If you're not allergic to it.
8819 2018-12-24 05:16:32 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?

8821 2018-12-24 05:16:26 Why should he reject donations from everyday people who happen to work at the  gas plant or the oil field and decided to support him with $10, $20, whatever they could give?? There’s no reason for him to do that. They aren’t CEOs or corporations or lobbyists.

8824 2018-12-24 05:16:15 Glade clean linnen scented oil makes me absolutely content. Could set me on fire around some glade clean linnen and I'd be like "mmmmm smells good"
8825 2018-12-24 05:16:14 The IMF funded a study by four separate economist about the hidden tax on the global economy for oil, coal, natural gas. In 2015 the drain on the global economy because of our grandfather's ways of producing antiquated energy is $5.3 trillion dollars. US buys $1T a year on energy

8833 2018-12-24 05:14:27 Did you forget that 90% of ISIS fighters came through Turkey? 
Did you forget that Turkey was the largest buyer of ISIS oil? 

Mr. President  @RT_Erdogan is a dictator who plays with fire and have 0 respect to the US and its allies.

8835 2018-12-24 05:14:19 Worked in AB Premier's cabinet office at the time. Real econ problem was oil going to $10bbl. Caused severe recession. But shit like saying "their heads explode" does not indicate any greater  degree of sophistication. And the problems are real now but this time it IS Feds fault.
8836 2018-12-24 05:13:50 Yoooo my mom is CRAZY with the oil. The stew can be simmering perfectly fine and she’ll still add more oil to the pot.

8838 2018-12-24 05:13:13 Oil extraction will be the death of us all! It boils down to greed! What you do to the Earth, you do to yourself! All your greed and harm to the earth is now coming back to haunt you! For every action there is a equal and opposite reaction! In less than 200 years you destroyed

8846 2018-12-24 05:12:15 OP Barbarossa was absolutely to expand German ‘race’ into USSR & overpopulate Russians bc Hitler seemed Germans superior race.He planned to use Slavs for slave Labor & specifically wanted the oil fields & farming lands in USSR.That’s fact, as documented by his generals & in books
8847 2018-12-24 05:12:09 Try this! Saute shallots in olive oil and garlic until fragrant. Add chicken mince and shallots and vodka sauce. Cook thoroughly. Serve with toasted white bread and a bit of Worcester sauce.

8854 2018-12-24 05:11:36 I filed, used cuticle oil, used base coat, and top coat
8855 2018-12-24 05:11:36 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
8856 2018-12-24 05:11:34 Of course, Mr Matteo Salvini can eat well. Why not? When an Italian oil company, partly owned by the Italian state of which Mr Salvini is a leading minister, colluded with corrupt Nigerian minister to defraud Nigeria of $6bn in oil revenues.
8857 2018-12-24 05:11:31 No. Try coconut oil instead.
8858 2018-12-24 05:11:25 I don't even have a lamp oil to lose, but i've still decided that im the king!
8859 2018-12-24 05:11:22 Start with a low amount of coconut oil. The lauric acid can upset your stomach, big time.
8860 2018-12-24 05:11:13 You don’t know what a smear is. It’s true that Beto receives one of the highest amounts of money from the oil and gas industry and that’s why he and a few dems voted with republicans against banning offshore oil drilling
8861 2018-12-24 05:11:12 Sick. The Ukrainian oil exploration loan I'm trying to sell has been such a pain in the ass. I can't come to poker tonight.
8862 2018-12-24 05:11:06 How many more dead US soliders do you need ? How many more that have lost limbs suffer from ptsd or commit suicide fighting wars that never end for oil, gas and conqured people who will always choose the political  ideology called ISLAM
8863 2018-12-24 05:10:50 Santa how i wish that every oil player will voluntary slash their pump prices P1/liter on xmas day. It wud only happen once a year and it cud benefit motorists and consumers as well.
8864 2018-12-24 05:10:48 Subhallah
8865 2018-12-24 05:10:39 That would raise the price of oil, which would help them because we have no way to prevent them from selling their oil. Or did you think the low price of oil was due to "market forces"?
8866 2018-12-24 05:10:29 マテウス、あのおねーさんよくね？
8867 2018-12-24 05:10:27 The cheap essential oil blends I got at Walmart are actually lovely and helping keep my bedroom from smelling like a sick person. The thieves is nice, and the “breathe easy” smells fantastic. #fuckwalmarttho
8868 2018-12-24 05:10:19 I think the oil in the Republican "machine" has got some water in it.
8869 2018-12-24 05:10:19 Syria was because we wanted to use Assad as an excuse to uproot him, and build an A. Oil Pipeline and B. A Rothschild Central Bank.

8892 2018-12-24 05:07:48 Oil got me hungry as fck
8893 2018-12-24 05:07:09 One of them led our country into a calamitous illegal war where thousands of British servicemen died and a million Iraqis were murdered all for the benefit of oil and war profiteers. Blair a really successful leader who deserves to be venerated for his actions
8894 2018-12-24 05:07:04 Again, I’m seeing the thread making the claim, but none of the actual receipts saying that he accepted over $200 from oil PACs/executives.

8896 2018-12-24 05:06:55 I have wanted to hold those previous generations of politicians responsible, since the 1980’s. This song from Midnight Oil, ”bed are burning” has help formed some of my political views. Parapraphing,

8898 2018-12-24 05:06:39 Some of the terpenes (naturally occurring) that are in cannabis can actually make you more alert and energized which can contribute to that anxiety.  Try using CBD oil when you feel that starting.
8899 2018-12-24 05:06:34 Lemon oil works wonders and it doesn’t damage the book!
8900 2018-12-24 05:06:18 Banana peel! Believe it or not- rub on effected area. Also, have you tried Lavender oil?
8901 2018-12-24 05:06:16 That's why I put coconut oil in it. That helps with energy, not just a jolt of caffeine.
8902 2018-12-24 05:06:11 Buy his snake oil.

8904 2018-12-24 05:05:52 how tf we take all this carbon and oil out of the ground then put it into our oceans and atmosphere.. wonder what the long term effect of that is..
8905 2018-12-24 05:05:41 We should follow Norways lead & export oil for world prices. Norway produces 3x the oil per capita of Canada AND is using that money to fund the transition and save for future. Is that that concept really too difficult to understand?
8906 2018-12-24 05:05:35 Discuss anything you want. But if you are going to be a shitsquib who equates individual donations of Texas voters — in a state with a third of a million petroleum workers — with oil industry support then I’m going to call it not journalism, but political hackery and horseshit.
8907 2018-12-24 05:04:50 Employment??? No money went to CREATE employment for the laidoff oil workers in western Canada
8908 2018-12-24 05:04:34 That could be the case. Or try to apply oil to ur ends before untwisting or it could be time for a trim. when the last time u had ur hair trimmed ?

8910 2018-12-24 05:04:27 Today I convened individual calls with the CEOs of the world’s six oil supermajors, and they have assured me the world is not running out of oil.
8911 2018-12-24 05:04:24 So.....today at the grocery store, I was in the spice aisle getting some olive oil and vinegar. In my attempt to locate the oil, I moved my cart to the side and went to get the brand I wanted. After I got it, I went back to my cart to put it in....but the cart wasn’t my cart.
8912 2018-12-24 05:04:21 Lol nah. This is me being nosey but helpful but... What kind of oil and spices are you using? Where are you getting your recipes?
8913 2018-12-24 05:04:21  wese Amjad bhai yeh kis kam ati hai ? mujhay toh Oil Rig lg raha hai ,
8914 2018-12-24 05:04:13 @SarahPalinUSA @kayleighmcenany @kimguilfoyle @michellemalkin @MonicaCrowley @KatiePavlich @LevinTV After that mantra in 2016, 'we are going to build a wall, a beautiful wall and guess who is going to pay for it'. A snake oil salesman will always be one
8915 2018-12-24 05:04:09 If you need to withdraw cash now, just go to gtbank on ojuelegba Lawson road opp forte oil filling station. That's basically the only ATM working in the whole of Lagos... Lol
8916 2018-12-24 05:04:06 If the Second Gulf War was a “war for oil,” why did the US immediately allow the new Iraqi government to control oil sales? Why did imports of Iraqi oil decrease? Why were no oil fields permanently seized? I didn’t support that war but every element of your tweet is nonsensical.
8917 2018-12-24 05:03:52 nothing like being all cozied up in bed with an oil diffuser on and a good movie
8918 2018-12-24 05:03:52 The apple cider rinse is a really good one! I did it for a while when I wasn't too lazy to and my hair was so soft !! Also avocado oil is very good for hair and skin (consuming, as a mask, either)
8919 2018-12-24 05:03:41 I should start using Argan oil on my hair

8922 2018-12-24 05:03:13 疲れが取れてきたので昨日の感想を
8923 2018-12-24 05:02:51 this coconut aloe vera castor oil over night hair mask feels so good on my scalp  & i love that i see results immediately after i wash it out the next morning
8924 2018-12-24 05:02:42 Have you been talking to the Jets or are you going to talk to them? Are you going to keep your word with the Wolverines and the players? Are you going to be a Snake Oil typical coach like Nick Saban and say that you're not leaving and than leave?
8925 2018-12-24 05:02:32 Been oil painting all day & night, holy shit. bleh. And all of it is obligatory (commissions from real life & holiday priority). Major apologies to anyone waiting commissions on me from the net. I shall get back to digital arting later today during X-mas eve & hopefully X-mas day
8926 2018-12-24 05:02:31 Nope. The Kurdish oil region is in Iraq & not affected by the withdrawal. Turks will smash Kurdish military power in Syria but Assad will eventually control the territory. One of the few Israeli allies in the region, the Kurds, will be slaughtered.
8927 2018-12-24 05:02:15 You can have any say you fucking want. Argue it, vote it. I’m not for Beto or Biden or Bernie; no fucks yet to give in 2018. But I am dead against misrepping individual donations of Texas voters as oil industry $ and calling it journalism. It’s a political operative’s horseshit.
8928 2018-12-24 05:02:10 Spotify is weird because it now thinks I exclusively listen to VGM and makes my daily playlists like:
1. Megalovania
2. Seaside Hill
3. Spiral Mountain
4. Stardew Valley Spirit's Eve Theme
5. Halo 3 Theme
6. Cover of 'Oil Ocean'
There's good variety here.
8929 2018-12-24 05:02:02 When the war began i reenlisted but the fbi blocked me but i supported then because of the oil but now its just another failed experiment by the us to police the ignorant the uneducated people around the globe thy wont listen they dont respect us and dont like us now invasion
8930 2018-12-24 05:01:56 Look at how minuscule those sanctions are. They essentially have one natural resource they export, oil, and we have no sanctions on their oil. Just admit that the socialist government mismanaged the country man it’s extremely obvious. 10million percent inflation?

8934 2018-12-24 05:01:31 Every thing they take over triples in price! That was part of the end game of the Climate Accord, they wanted government to take over energy, gas, oil, and electricity....if they ever do the price of everything will triple, you'll need govt. subsidies to pay you electric bill!

8949 2018-12-24 04:59:20 If you don’t understand why lower prices due to increased supply and decreased demand is bad for oil going forward than you shouldn’t be able to trade with other peoples money. May be good in short term for ICE but writing is on the wall. Tread carefully.

8954 2018-12-24 04:58:36 ALRIGHT. Time for a winter time dry hands tip. Put a little olive oil and sugar in your hands, then rub those boys together for a minute. Rinse it off and use some good lotion. There ya go good as new so soft.
8955 2018-12-24 04:58:31 So many millions believe olive oil is the only healthful fat, yet it's so ludicrous. They must believe we somehow survived 2 million years of hominid co-evolution with deadly animal fat, and - a miracle! - found the healthy one just in time a couple of centuries ago.

8958 2018-12-24 04:58:10 I didn't even know about this & I only fat activate. This is because I am unaware of dry activation. Is there a spice that is better if you dry activate? Aren't all spices supposed to be mixed with oil?

Too bad the lunatic-fringe took over Edmonton & Ottawa.

8968 2018-12-24 04:56:30 It’s true man. One thing I can’t stand is a smart ass person who wants to throw their degree on. me and say they are educated. Yes you are educated in your field, not on everything. Even as something as basic as a oil change on a Kenworth 900, he would think it takes 4 quarts
8969 2018-12-24 04:56:28 Me too. My best experiment thus far is that the perfect topping to sautéed green beans/pecans/garlic/olive oil is.......Madagascar vanilla. It sizzles and nearly evaporates but adds an amazing flavor. Come to think of it, I’ll add that to my meal tomorrow. 
8970 2018-12-24 04:56:23 So are all of your CBD oil ads 
8971 2018-12-24 04:56:09 Oil can quickly make its way to being down 3 MBD plus by second half with production cuts sector wide and  world wide. With OPEC coming in close to 2 MBD alone of cuts by end of January things will be looking a lot tighter in the #oil $USO market. Easily extra 500k other sources
8972 2018-12-24 04:56:05 It became political issue when LK Advani started Raqt Yatra ( trail of blood). ( Though he named it Rath Yatra).

BJP gained 88 seats from 2.
After forming Govt they realised that Ram Mandir is not a cake. We have to deal with Global powers and buy oil from Muslim Nations.

9007 2018-12-24 04:52:17 Hey @bucadibeppo .  We think your olive oil is the best we’ve ever tasted. Curious to know if this is available for purchase at your stores or can you share the brand so we can find it somewhere.
9008 2018-12-24 04:52:14 Box of cake mix, two eggs, a third cup oil, mixy mixy, 10-15 minutes at 350 depending on how crunchy you want em. I suggest mixing the eggs and oil first, then adding the dry mix.  Add the mix-ins when you add the dry stuff, a half to two thirds a cup, the dough is stiff.
9009 2018-12-24 04:52:09 Hi,
I probably have the answer. I have an organic oil blend that works on it. Many of my friends who has psoriasis and didn’t find a good treatment for year, tried it and now it’s gone. Just message me and I ll send you a bottle. It is really amazing.

9027 2018-12-24 04:49:36 I think we see a substantial drop in US output by 2nd quarter. Should start a trickle down effect from the beginning of 2019 if prices are still in this range could definitely see 5-600,000 barrels come off production by second quarter. If oil is under $50 midyear another 500,000

What's YOUR problem with that Mr. Dean?

Compare to PMB that promised to fight corruption, build infrastructure, tackle insecurity & stabilize our economy.

9055 2018-12-24 04:46:00 Yeah, that’s a rumor being spread by natural news, anti vaxxer sites and essential oil sites, many of those posting aren’t even Americans actually
9056 2018-12-24 04:45:38 No it's not. Literally, the one major issue was that he got donations from employee of oil companies.

9064 2018-12-24 04:43:50 Look man, it's UNACCEPTABLE to take money from Big Oil and Gas executives, AFTER you took a pledge not to do that. It's UNACCEPTABLE to be against Universal Healthcare (Medicare For All). Beto is a Neoliberal from a giant fossil fuel-producing state.

9068 2018-12-24 04:43:00 Context and analysis of O'Rourke's voting record. Context and details of the "oil and gas" contributions. Accurately meaningful use of the term "average Democrat".
9069 2018-12-24 04:42:57 I need fully synthetic oil for my stream. Are you open today

9071 2018-12-24 04:42:38 They have flasks that looks like gel, tanning oil, and sunscreen.. I got them for faster
9072 2018-12-24 04:42:37 So is the fundamental difference between contributions from the oil industry and individual voters in a state with a third of a million petroleum workers. But Sirota incapable of citing such because it fucks with a preconceived political agenda. You, equally incapable, it seems.

9076 2018-12-24 04:41:48 Donald Trump pulling the troops out of Syria and Afghanistan is the greatest move this decade as we will not be needing their oil for much longer now that the battery cars are in progress they can sort their own problems out from now on  Merry Christmas #TRUMP #Syria #USA #USAK
9077 2018-12-24 04:41:41 hey I saw your post about skin care. I have the same issue pretty bad on my elbows and I just started using cannabis oil extract mixed with coconut oil. my cousin makes it here in new zealand so if you ever come over here i can hook you up with some. It works for me really good.
9078 2018-12-24 04:41:31 Look at you.  You retweet Wikileaks and Pravda.  You live in a third world country which if not for oil would be Belarus.  Right?  Win a war without help, Russia. Losers.
9079 2018-12-24 04:41:13 America was only there for the oil - it's always the oil - the whole middle east  
9080 2018-12-24 04:41:10 Don’t agree with him on what? So far their biggest problem with Beto is that Texans who works with oil companies gave him some money
9081 2018-12-24 04:40:58 Isn't it true that the oil and gas industry in Canada is still mainly foreign controlled?
9082 2018-12-24 04:40:52 This is like those obnoxious ads from the oil and forestry industries that think their Twitter campaigns will fix their failing public support. But this doubling-down ad makes it worse. UBC is now a place to avoid. For students, industry, donors, and government.
9083 2018-12-24 04:40:27 งั้นเป็นลูกสะใภ้ได้ป่ะ
9084 2018-12-24 04:40:26 I like the idea of them drowning in oil.
9085 2018-12-24 04:40:25 If the products being “vaped” were essential oils from beneficial plants that make compounds that compliment human metabolisms it wouldn’t be as bad. An example would be having vape pens with mint, lavender, or a citrus oil in them. Still an unnecessary process, but same concept.

CEO should buy bells & whistles with yesterday's rusty pipe design for his cell phone app, before someone notices down stream. Hard to make oil cheaper for those off shore, since Harper's oil went off line with big layoffs.
9108 2018-12-24 04:37:37 Not a lot of people know how to change oil hahahaha
9109 2018-12-24 04:37:26 Some studies notes that fish oil supplements reduce weight in obese individuals when combined with diet or exercise. Also reduce waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio.
9110 2018-12-24 04:37:24 Why aren't you working on stopping off shore oil drilling off of SC shores. You can not afford to be Trump's best friend.
9111 2018-12-24 04:37:19 It might be entirely placebo but I find MCT oil really seems to improve my mental focus and clarity as well. It literally gives me an HD type of vision
9112 2018-12-24 04:37:11 His position on climate change is appalling. We will all die if we don't stop using oil now.
9113 2018-12-24 04:37:09 Oil prices rose more than 1 percent on Monday on signs that the recent price plunge may start crimping supply from the U.S., currently the world's biggest oil producer, though concerns about global economy continues to weigh.

9121 2018-12-24 04:36:22 That’s ridiculous.

The only problem Canada has are the lunatics & ideologues running the Fed government.

The Liberals have decided they don’t want Canada to be in the fossil fuel business, yet Global oil demand is 100+ million barrels a day & growing.

They need to go. Period.

9126 2018-12-24 04:35:33 Actually, it’s all the people denying that personal choices are driving GHG’s. The C tax we pay for those choices is what pays for the transition. Denying a pipeline or the income of an oil province while continuing the same old energy use merely changes the end point of the $$$.

9131 2018-12-24 04:34:58 I’m sure Saudi Arabia is going to shut down their oil production as well. It ranks as the largest exporter of petroleum, and plays a leading role in OPEC. The petroleum sector accounts for roughly 87% of budget revenues, 42% of GDP, and 90% of export earnings.

9138 2018-12-24 04:34:28 looks like it builds over 09 and peaks in early 10 which fits with China's cycle (and the broader global cycle too).    would need to assess how it fits with other indicators of China' 14-15 slowdown more carefully, may fit better with the oil related investment cycle

9186 2018-12-24 04:27:45 Who is responsible for the poor image of oil sand in Canada? Isn't that partly because of wrong policies of the previous government? Isn't that because we all think for short term gains?

9198 2018-12-24 04:26:12 so how long can my car go without an oil change? i got xmas presents to shop for still HAHA.......
9199 2018-12-24 04:26:01 Olive oil extra virgin. Diet alkaline diet detox
9200 2018-12-24 04:25:53 Our economy is not growing like it was the last 9 quarters. Oil is a leading indicator and it's down 40% in under 6 months. Inflation is slowing. Housing has slowed. These are all things affected by the Fed. But even if the Fed changes course, the market won't roar back.
9201 2018-12-24 04:25:48 Yes it is.. I’ve tried pot .. cbd oil etc., I am in constant pain every minute of every day .. but am unable to even get Tylenol 3.. I’m 57.. granny .. just looking to have a quality life.. not be an addict..’I’m tired ..
9202 2018-12-24 04:25:35 i pun ada eczema dekat tangan macamni few months ago, i guna coconut oil je sapu dkt tempat tu and alhamdulillah dah okay. so try la! coconut oil tu boleh dapat dkt farmasi 
9203 2018-12-24 04:25:24 We just woke up only to realized that the was a  break in. Meat , Meal Mill and cooking oil was stolen. Happy Xmas young thugs
9204 2018-12-24 04:25:11 Coconut oil
9205 2018-12-24 04:25:02 We have missed call and magic oil gurus living among us 
9206 2018-12-24 04:24:46 Your logic fails. Unlike the oil embargo, the majority of EV owners’ “gas station” is at your own home.
9207 2018-12-24 04:24:37 Good point. Plus dubnyk had a great goalie coach who I forgot his name in Phoenix who helped transform him into the starter he is today. Talbot had a good coach in NY that helped him a lot too. Good system and better goalie coaches
9208 2018-12-24 04:24:26 Obviously the previous government also failed to meet the future demand of the oil patch. Isn't that because we have been thinking without any clear vision for Alberta? Why we haven't been to diversify Alberta's economy all these years so we don't suffer when oil drops to 20$?
9209 2018-12-24 04:24:25 pointing out that Beto has voted to deregulate wall st and with oil/gas isn't something that concerns you as, I assume, a Dem voter?
9210 2018-12-24 04:24:17 あいぽん使ってるからあいぱっどにしちゃおうかなって思ってたけどあんどろいど系とそんな変わらないなら本体安くしちゃおうかな〜〜 私もほぼwifiで使うと思う…うーんうーん……
9211 2018-12-24 04:23:27 He is an unaccountable, unimaginative, uninspiring, lying dishrag of a man. He joined a rival immediately and hasn’t got an ounce of humility or leadership in his bones. He is a snake oil salesman and nothing more. We’ve had bad and terrible coaches, he is the worst.
9212 2018-12-24 04:23:09 Idk here’s some albums I enjoyed this year:

Album of the year: THINK: PEACE by Clarence Clarity.

Other dope albums:
• Vein - Errorzone
• Oil of Every Pearl’s Uni-nsides - SOPHIE
• FM! - Vince Staples
• iridescence - Brockhampton
• You Won’t Get What You Want - Daughters
9213 2018-12-24 04:23:09 why won’t the sleepy essential oil knock me out god
9214 2018-12-24 04:22:57 I'm convinced I can do better. We know what to heat the oil to now and how much thinner to make the shells. We will do better next time.
9215 2018-12-24 04:22:57 oil execs are not PACs and I'm wondering what is the criteria for one to be an oil exec. Anyone with a VP title? Sr. Director? That can be meaningless in some companies.
9216 2018-12-24 04:22:53 Nope, he supports Green New Deal, anti-fracking wants to go 100% Green etc. While Obama bragged about expanding oil production to record levels as the earth is on its death bed to pollution and Beto votes for many Republican pollution bills against his party in a very blue seat.
9217 2018-12-24 04:22:41 So, I support a pipeline. But the truth-skirting in ABgov’s #KeepCanadaWorking irks me. Yes, it means ‘more oil!’ 1 tanker a day? Snds reasonable- Up from 1/wk!
9218 2018-12-24 04:22:39 cbd oil helped my anxiety go down in like 3 minutes what the HELL
9219 2018-12-24 04:22:24 I'll never shop at the Meijer on illons road in fort Wayne IN again went to there bathroom and it smelled so bad like a whole case of oil spiled on the ground it gave me a bad headache to the point I couldnt use the bathroom and when I tell them I don't even get an I sorry
9220 2018-12-24 04:21:36 Compare the prosperity in Nordic nations with the wealth disparity, poverty, and oppression in most oil producing regions of the world, including much of the US.

9222 2018-12-24 04:21:07 Oil spilled by unidentified man opp to times office #airoli. No police at spot, multiple motorcyclist have fallen. 
Pls take immediate action before any casualties.@Navimumpolice @MirchiJeeturaaj @ThaneCityPolice @replu #Mumbai
9223 2018-12-24 04:21:05 My view on H&S
- Potentially large pay off of H&S pattern is a deadly attraction. managing mind becomes difficult for new traders
- Shoulder break requires change in market narrative. In this case - Oil trending higher or some macro screw up by politicians
9224 2018-12-24 04:20:57 Those two words are like oil and water. Also, your kitchen must have great WIFI
9225 2018-12-24 04:20:42 Yeah Lucas Oil and Beech Bend (My local tracks) have cool new age wireless stuff
9226 2018-12-24 04:20:37 I do a cross between Keto and Paleo.  I cannot process dairy foods, but have no problem with coconut oil.  I went from 170 to 140 using it.  I love it.  Never felt better.
9227 2018-12-24 04:20:37 โทดนะฮะ อันนี้คนหรือขี้ฮะเนี้ย
9228 2018-12-24 04:20:35 Far too many people need a boogie man to be the cause of their problems, for white supremacists it’s jews, for liberals is oil companies and republicans. When in reality they do it for the hope that the world isn’t chaos and completely uncontrollable
9229 2018-12-24 04:20:35 Sana oil
9230 2018-12-24 04:20:34 The peppermint oil is on my scalp 
9231 2018-12-24 04:20:26 Everything that happens in episode one could come straight out of a session of Keep on the Borderlands. Right down to noobs splitting he party and serious adventurers using flaming oil. Awesome show!
9232 2018-12-24 04:20:26 Nonsense. I say MAGAts can't see the truth because they are caught up in a web of love for their god. Who benefits from America leaving? Whose port can now be used to transfer oil? Who will control policy in the ME for decades? Any answer other than Putin is wrong. Check it out.
9233 2018-12-24 04:20:25 my diet only consists of junk food and junk food only. i probably have more oil in my body than blood
9234 2018-12-24 04:20:24 1/Oil PSUs & Gujarat PSUs contributed 250 crores to #StatueOfUnity from CSR(Corporate Social Responsibility) funding under d conservation of national heritage category.
For 2017-18, mandatory CSR exp. under Sec 135 of d Companies Act was Rs 10,000 crore, 11% increase over 2016-17
9235 2018-12-24 04:20:10 comb ur hair with ur fingers up onto the top of your head, loosely twist it into itself until it becomes a bun and wrap it with a spiral hair tie so it's loose and secure. u can put some argan or coconut oil on it prior. it's what i do with my hair and my clients for easiness

9238 2018-12-24 04:19:24 I was dealing with a pot of hot oil at work filtering the deep fryer and this girl put an ice cube down my shirt, I jerked around tried to get away, my foot caught on the sanitizer bucket stand and I fell and my elbow slam dunked into the hot oil

9240 2018-12-24 04:19:02 Try something natural. My dad cured my brother’s psoriasis with tea tree oil. You have to make sure is pure tea tree oil, and is not a blend of oils or mineral oil. Hope you feel better soon.
9241 2018-12-24 04:18:55 Who cares what @FaithGoldy thinks. This Havergal woman worked for the Sun News Network-went kaput. Then The Rebel-got fired. She has nothing in common with hard working individuals who survive by working in the oil or related industries.
9242 2018-12-24 04:18:48 จริงค่ะ แม่น่าจะอั้นไว้ตอนปวดท้องงง
9243 2018-12-24 04:18:34 Chili oil is essential to my diet
9244 2018-12-24 04:18:24 facts are war? perhaps you media folks shouldn't be calling someone progressive who is pro-wall street and big oil
9245 2018-12-24 04:18:20 U lost me Trump.  U have destroyed the oil markets.  Texas hates u now!
9246 2018-12-24 04:18:14 Oh and progressives are going after beto because of he took $ from oil execs when he signed a pact that he wouldn't and his voting record on banks and the economy. Wanting to back a candidate that does something on climate change instead of just taking $ is bad now?
9247 2018-12-24 04:18:13 Just use tea tree oil jesus christ
9248 2018-12-24 04:18:05 หรอออยหรอ นิดเดียวจิงหรอออออออ
9249 2018-12-24 04:17:42 It's Christmas Eve and I don't feel it
9250 2018-12-24 04:17:34 “Next year just get me an oil change” 
9251 2018-12-24 04:17:30 Guess who’s a stupid dumb ass and threw olive oil at her sister and it spilled on the couch and now we have a cornstarch covered couch 
9252 2018-12-24 04:17:28 Hellman's, mayonnaise is just egg and oil.
9253 2018-12-24 04:17:25 A vitamin and edible essential oil vape would be awesome.
9254 2018-12-24 04:17:20 Actions matter more than personality.  Since when is personality more important than results.  We had 8 years of a total failure of a presidency from a snake oil charmer.  58% hoodwinked because they don’t like a guys personality. Must be,can’t be policy, that would mean stupid
9255 2018-12-24 04:17:08 Hahahhahaha daming oil sa fes ko

9258 2018-12-24 04:16:53 IM OUT OF MOST OF MY OIL PAINT BC I USED IT ON MY MEMOIR
9259 2018-12-24 04:16:49 Yup! I like to make sure to add whatever wine I’m drinking for color as well. And I always split the butter and olive oil.
9260 2018-12-24 04:16:43 I stole this, Donald Trump proposed a 50 foot solar border wall, he now has liberals so confused so confused they suddenly support oil gas and coal.
9261 2018-12-24 04:16:42 Monat rejuvenique oil!! All naturally based:) and good for a zillion other things!

9263 2018-12-24 04:15:50 LimeLife by Alcone’s One Drop Wonder pomifera oil in combination with Forty Cure Cream. My son has severe psoriasis and this is the only thing that has helped. And it’s all natural with no harmful chemicals!!
9264 2018-12-24 04:15:46 Should be doing that in Ottawa, not in Sask and Alberta.  We already support the oil industry.
9265 2018-12-24 04:14:57 Also you said nothing about Beto's disastrous vote to open offshore waters to oil exploration. Young people don't have time for this political shenanigans. We have 12 years to #ActOnClimate, THAT'S IT. Be a part of the solution or GET OUT OF THE WAY.
9266 2018-12-24 04:14:56 Day three of twitter thread madness: turns out dish soap and olive oil DO clean makeup brushes! 

more testing tonight following yesterday’s hiatus for my day job 
9267 2018-12-24 04:14:49 Only inconsistent if the court decisions were the same. NG did not pass environmentals or consultations. Yes natives want back in now, but work stopped almost 5 years ago. TMX passed but with oil not bitumen and had less consultation issues. Maybe he got it, need not clarity.
9268 2018-12-24 04:14:49 AND THE AWARDS FOR THE BEST DARING GIRL WHO RISKS HER MENTAL STATE FOR A BOOK GOES TO THE PHAMOUS MARIA...THESE AWARDS WERE BROUGHT TO YOU BY KASHMIR COOKING OIL AND BANASPATI , POWERED BY Q MOBILE 
9269 2018-12-24 04:14:43 Oof. Sending you e-hugs. At least this holiday you can drink some wine, where as last year you were preggers and couldn’t. Soooo improvement? Maybe? Not really. Le sigh. Family! Can’t live with them & can’t boil them in oil.

9277 2018-12-24 04:13:33 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.

9281 2018-12-24 04:12:50 I just realised how I really can’t tolerate mineral oil sheesh
9282 2018-12-24 04:12:44 When I worked in Oil & Gas, a common recurring theme was non-oilfield folk purchasing generic high-resolution laboratory instrumentation, when actually what we needed was good repeatability and dynamic range in the face of uncontrolled non-laboratory conditions
9283 2018-12-24 04:12:40 우정이라는 기계에 잘 정제된 예의라는 기름을 바르는 것은 현명하다.
It is wise to apply the oil of refined politeness to the mechanisms of friendship.
9284 2018-12-24 04:12:20 try the human nature sunflower oil 
9285 2018-12-24 04:12:17 Bakersfield has a quirky charm-- music, oil, the Kern River Canyon of Death.
9286 2018-12-24 04:12:10 That is bullshit. He took no PAC money. The oil and gas $ came from employees/individuals  in that business — you may not know Texas but a large  % of people here by necessity work in oil and gas.
9287 2018-12-24 04:12:02 Idk I’ll have to try it!! My people usually use oil unless it’s in the rice cooker
9288 2018-12-24 04:11:37 Murray’s mixed with Pink Oil is tried and true.
9289 2018-12-24 04:11:31 I don’t see anything except an intercept article referencing said open secrets that explicitly said that from oil executives, which is what the pledge banned, Bernie accidentally accepted... $27.

9292 2018-12-24 04:11:12 His ceiling was always a potential useful back up & that hasn't changed. A 10 game stretch doesn't change that nor does the fact playing goal for the Oilers is a difficult task.
9293 2018-12-24 04:11:12 sadly no. another friend recommended clove oil which i also don't have but i can get some tomorrow morning.
9294 2018-12-24 04:11:10 Oil and water together, how can I be whole? I'm like this hair, all strands and hiding places, yet out in the wide-open too like the moon.

9303 2018-12-24 04:09:54 I live in the heart of oil country, and come from an oil family. The economy didn't start tanking on the day Trudeau was elected. I definitely don't agree with his decisions on pipelines, but he definitely doesn't control the price of our oil. There's more at work overall here.
9304 2018-12-24 04:09:45 See Happy birthday brother, don't mind those useless peeps out there since Ba na ubansu ka ara Ba.
9305 2018-12-24 04:09:34 The thing you are forgetting to mention in all of that, is all the teams are talking about are/were better than the Oilers & better defensively. The same issues Brossoit had w/ his game still exist in Winnipeg but they can be hidden on a better team.
9306 2018-12-24 04:09:33 Sure they can. And I can call you a lot of things - doesn't make me right. "Tarsands", just like "dirty oil", was coined by foreign interests to demonize Canadian oil. Idiots fell for that.
9307 2018-12-24 04:09:15 I need these dark marks to go away. I hope this tea tree oil works

If you use this device that is environmentally damaging and not needed to sustain life you are a hypocrite and don't practice what you preach. You defines hypocrisy. Mic drop
9319 2018-12-24 04:07:22 Like oil and water knowing better and logical thinking doesn't mix with liberals. 
9320 2018-12-24 04:07:05 Thank you so much! I have spiked it with garlic and drizzled it with olive oil, and put it on at around 160C.  Might drop the temp a bit then.  Good tip about smelling it!
9321 2018-12-24 04:07:04 You're doing the right thing Trump. Your true supporters support you on this. Ignore the warmongers pretending to be patriots when all they really care about is the oil in the Golan Heights.
9322 2018-12-24 04:06:56 Wishing Supreme Court Justice Reform, higher oil flows as he fought for agreeing to bring a Democrat saying loud and good Border, Criminal Justice Reform.
9323 2018-12-24 04:06:50 Surrounding nations, nationalizing the oil reserves of the country was a breaking point heavy sanctions were put on Venezuela and economic hitmen were dispatched to cripple it's economy. To this day the country struggles under massive sanctions and a depreciated oil price.

9338 2018-12-24 04:05:22 Braids! While wearing braids, make sure to moisturize with oil and wash when needed. Low maintenance helps with hair growth!
9339 2018-12-24 04:05:08 Does anyone actually have said “receipts” for this? Can’t seem to find any record, and Oil Change USA still lists Bernie as an active member of the no fossil fuel money pledge.
9340 2018-12-24 04:05:07 Oh wow, renewables contribute more to GDP than oil sands? And growing faster? And that’s a bad thing? No, that’s amazing!
9341 2018-12-24 04:04:52 Hanukkah we’re pretty good at getting a days worth of oil to last 8 days  #HolidayCustomsAroundTheWorld
9342 2018-12-24 04:04:43 Does @DangeRussWilson oil himself up during games?  How did he get out of that jam?  #KCvsSEA
9343 2018-12-24 04:04:36 All you have is lies. It makes you trumpian. Sad.

Beto took money from people who are employees of the oil & gas industry. If you know anything about TX you would understand how this works. You are quoting Sirota who got caught in his lies & then walked it back.
9344 2018-12-24 04:04:18 You do realize there are two way bets in every traded instrument right? There are longs and shorts in currencies, bonds, gold, oil, bitcoin, as well as stocks, and options and everything else that's traded. This is a really a short-sighted question on your point
9345 2018-12-24 04:04:10  This “bro” will want ALL the receipts for all 2020 candidates. Betos receipts align w Trump, the 1%, oil and gas, and banks. He can quit while he’s ahead. He will not do any better than Corporate Clinton.
9346 2018-12-24 04:04:00 $$$, Oil,  Bush family had too many friends there. Knew that from start. Why I thought going into Iraq was wrong or at least wrong time for it.

9349 2018-12-24 04:03:34 Ooh what sort of painting? If given time I'd take up oil painting. I actually have an oil set but rarely ever use it 
9350 2018-12-24 04:03:30 what we need is chaos in Russia, cheaper oil and a world wide ban on their aluminum and other materials
9351 2018-12-24 04:03:00 State owned oil company, high royalties, value added: the result is each Norwegian is worth more than a million dollars. Alberta has failed at managing its resource. #racetothebottom

9353 2018-12-24 04:02:35 If you want a plant based, proven effective solution try our black soap and shea butter. It is the key to clear healthy skin  I also recommend taking black seed oil. It has anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, and anthelmintic properties.. soo good for psoriasis 
9354 2018-12-24 04:02:26 Made with Vitamin B and coconut oil.
9355 2018-12-24 04:02:19 I'm new to double cleansing. I dont wear make up just sunscreen. If guna micellar water then oil cleansing is it okay? Or just micellar water is sufficient enough? #tanyaTK
9356 2018-12-24 04:02:18 It’s their disingenuous spin (like David Sirota’s article) that are meant to damage Beto’s image that is infuriating. Report the facts, but don’t twist them to match your partisan view. Sirota’s claim that Beto took oil money (when it was individual contributions) was BS
9357 2018-12-24 04:02:05 Hermosa diccion. Pero yo te la voy a ahorrar y te voy a decir cuanto son los costos operarivos para que el sector sea rentable.
El Kilometro debe ser cobrado en razon de 1 litro de gas oil x 3.
Un litro de gas oil multiplicalo por 3, y eso es ll que tenes que cobrar el kilometro.

9362 2018-12-24 04:01:41 Unfortunately with the current anti anything but coal and oil paid politicians I doubt they would do that.

9364 2018-12-24 04:01:23 Alberta needs to start investing in the future not the past. Retrain our oil workers for solo and wind energy jobs.

9366 2018-12-24 04:01:19 So my sis got prescribed cbd oil for pain and that shit is fireee!!
9367 2018-12-24 04:01:13 Try Sacha Inchi Oil. 92% Omega 3,6,9. Tastes great and good for you. Easy substitute for fish oil. Only 6% saturated fat v 40% in fish oils.
9368 2018-12-24 04:01:10 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, yet Medicare.

Keep digging you liberal/socialist playbook.

Now do socialism not based on oil!

9383 2018-12-24 03:59:51 Truthfully, I don't know anymore. One minute it's like the Gang Who Couldn't Shoot Straight and the next minute I think it's on purpose so some someone's can swoop in and buy cheap stocks, real estate, and oil tanking here helps Russia/OPEC because drilling will slow down here.
9384 2018-12-24 03:59:39 Just hoping everyone has a good day tomorrow. I'm gonna grab some cider, dab oil, game, then pass out. Later.
9385 2018-12-24 03:59:27 i deep condition my hair with a DIY mix in a desperate attempt to nurture my dead hair, but the olive oil gets all over the back of my neck and makes me feel slimy and i dont like it

9389 2018-12-24 03:59:04 Last Christmas I got paprika and olive oil in my stocking, so I really have no clue what my parents will have up their sleeve this year
9390 2018-12-24 03:59:00 I don't endorse that recipe, but I can recommend lightly sauteed in garlic and olive oil, with salt pork/pancetta. At least once.
9391 2018-12-24 03:58:52 What a pathetic position. My beef w O’Rourke is his voting record w Trump, banks, and oil and gas. My issue is that he couldn’t win in his own state. My issue is he’s Obama 2.0. Obama was all talk, no walk. Done w that shit. He will not get the ~45% independents.
9392 2018-12-24 03:58:46 Which allies?. The ones committing GENOCIDE against Hebrew Biafra and Southern Cameroon for oil and gas!.
9393 2018-12-24 03:58:36 So China, India and South Korea can stop buying Iran's crude in May and purchase from us. What type of oil is Iran selling?
9394 2018-12-24 03:58:32 Alberta & SK oil workers remind me of spoiled children in a toy store that throw themselves on the floor and scream until the parents gives in and buys them the toy. When they finally get something, they don’t appreciate it because they have never been taught manners.
9395 2018-12-24 03:58:25 Protecting our homeland... Which is protecting our citizens rights, which means policing the world when they try to harm us.

  In reality I'd say more like 90% of Americans think its "the oil must flow".

9400 2018-12-24 03:57:24 Barack didn't love him. I'm going with him. 
I'd rather be on Irans side. We have to go with a country that has had a culture. An ancient culture. Saudis are just savages, who found oil under the sand. Watch Lawrence of Arabia, if you don't like to read.
9401 2018-12-24 03:57:17 I take your points but human dignity and respect reigns over oil. Strong military presence actually protects vulnerable people. This is akin to a Holocaust again and we must protect all human, everywhere/sadly , we cannot but each positive action is awesome, protects our friends

9405 2018-12-24 03:56:54 No, he is just the original snake oil salesman who makes up stories to enhance his own narrative.
9406 2018-12-24 03:56:33 みんな声はかけない感じかなぁ
9407 2018-12-24 03:56:33 Snake oil sales. Finding people dumb enough to buy his bs or smart enough to know he was a conman and knew how to use that knowledge to their own benefit.
9408 2018-12-24 03:56:26 This coconut oil is supposed to be for my stretch marks, but it makes me smell so good
9409 2018-12-24 03:56:14 These "Real Albertans" mansplaining to everyone how we somehow drive the country is seriously lame.  "My house is on top of an oil reserve, bow down to me!"
9410 2018-12-24 03:56:04 such hypocrites......the repugnant party stole iraqi oil ; raped & pillaged the US treasury....& they're doing it again......the new plan is to convert to covert/contractor military action thru frontier services or the wagner group
9411 2018-12-24 03:55:56 Oil is done.  Move on to more renewable resources.  Why do people always insist on living in the past.  Things change and if you can't change then you are in trouble.
9412 2018-12-24 03:55:48 Btw who tf uses conventional oil to cook when lard is perfect
9413 2018-12-24 03:55:46 I bet you have ties to the oil lobbying industry
9414 2018-12-24 03:55:39 Three biggest anti fact positions held by both Reps and corporate Dems:

2: Universal healthcare is too expensive (keep taking pharma and drug $$)
3: Too dangerous to stop wars (keep taking weapons $$)

9420 2018-12-24 03:54:33 I called them earlier tonight and advised I should return the car to the airport and exchange there, poor service and poor quality of rental car, message related to tires, oil & filter

9422 2018-12-24 03:54:26 What about Texas, heard oil is there.
9423 2018-12-24 03:54:13 Yeah, I remember the scientists telling us in the late '70s Long Island NY & Florida would be under water; we would run out of oil; polar ice caps would be melted; mass migration would cause chaos; all this by 2000. Yet, here we are.

9455 2018-12-24 03:50:15 No one doubts Oil being a significant reason for USA becoming stranded in the Middle East. Now, w/ shift to EVs and Energy Storage, a new age is being ushered in, faster than media can spin. Give me power to generate in my back yard? Absolutely!!!
9456 2018-12-24 03:50:14 It's not 2015, that dog don't hunt. Global oil prices are not the issue. We are in the situation we're in precisely because of the federal government. Notley is powerless, the feds alone have the ability to fix the problem and they've failed miserably. Biblically even.
9457 2018-12-24 03:50:12 We don’t want someone that’s an oil shill when the planet is literally melting. Simple.
9458 2018-12-24 03:50:11 Actually most of your “fuel” ie oil is imported from Saudi and Ecuador and you also use natural gas for heat which Comes from the prairies as well. You also use polymer products made from oil as well as many other things
9459 2018-12-24 03:50:11 I guess it's only our job when we want something out of it like strategic military advantage or OIL!

9465 2018-12-24 03:49:57 Perhaps if you learned how to read a map you'd realize how easy you've made it for Putin to run an oil pipeline to the Mediterranean Sea, gaining huge influence on the energy supplies of western & southern Europe. But I forget, you're working for Putin.
9466 2018-12-24 03:49:55 Squirrel Oil is the best.
9467 2018-12-24 03:49:36 Watching my girls play Guess Who today, thinking about a grown up version:

“Has your person regularly changed the oil in their car?”
“Does your person feel guilty about not sleeping 7 hours per night regularly?”
9468 2018-12-24 03:49:35 I take mafia advice from a olive oil importer who is actually an actor. and dead.
9469 2018-12-24 03:49:32 Same  I end up blurting out random things trying to make convo and die a little inside with each stupid comment. Gotta step away and regroup. And breathe. And shoot 1000 drops of cbd oil in my mouth and try again 
9470 2018-12-24 03:49:27 I have never used the mask of my hair. I have used conditioners and hot oil. I'll be willing to try it and give you my opinion
9471 2018-12-24 03:49:24 Oil change and a full tank of petrol better be coming yo way ga dammit 
9472 2018-12-24 03:49:21 Oil ponds were in the oil sands before any mining started. You are into scare tactics and probably know nothing about the history of the area and how extraction is actually accomplished or even how many mines there are.
9473 2018-12-24 03:49:14 really digging this essential oil diffuser
9474 2018-12-24 03:49:13 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
9475 2018-12-24 03:49:13 Wow. I can smell it. Oil rice
9476 2018-12-24 03:49:10 Sometimes, unfortunately, we need to use our military, as much as we hate it. Not for oil, or other assets, but because we can’t let the world explode around us. Trump is going to inflame the world because he deserting our alliances.
9477 2018-12-24 03:49:06 Ill-prepared commercials and producers will be forced to hedge at breakeven or risk default.

Reference: The string of airlines acquired by Southwest after the 2008 oil rally to $147/bbl nearly bankrupted the unhedged airlines.

9479 2018-12-24 03:48:33 He did so many things against climate change initiatives he could do a paid speech specific to his oil/gas legacy. And idiots will bring up his support of Paris Agreement as if it meant a thing given his fracking, pipelines, drilling, lifting export ban. All talk, no walk Obama.

9481 2018-12-24 03:48:19 Kicked out? Then tell me why are US SOF in former capital of the caliphate? Operating several major bases. Holding majority of Syrian oil assets? While you’re at it, game out for us what happens if Obama bombs Syria back in 2013.
9482 2018-12-24 03:48:14 Can you please tell me what you have done to deal with your Crohn’s disease? Nothing has helped me to this point. I wake up every day 2 hrs earlier than normal for work because I try to go to the RR before I have to head out to work. It’s gotten so bad, I’ve turned to CBD oil.

9485 2018-12-24 03:47:40 You’re 100% correct, doesn’t stop you from continuing to do it though does it!? And let’s face it, you’re only in it for the control of oil
9486 2018-12-24 03:47:38 Time to dust of that copy of SimAnt. A bit of eucalyptus oil on their trail confuses them.

9488 2018-12-24 03:47:26 Enlighten me. So when global oil price goes down, we should have cheaper petrol?
9489 2018-12-24 03:47:23 Oh FFS, this “voting with oil companies” drivel again. Y’all need to get new lines, and learn some shit about representing a constituency.
Also, how much cash does Bernie take from the NRA?
9490 2018-12-24 03:47:21 The money makers unfortunately are the snake oil salesmen that try to sell you on their 2 hour work week program from some exotic beach. Incredible how many people buy into that garbage.  Write to inform, write to entertain, write to help- then someday worry about how to monetize
9491 2018-12-24 03:46:45 I was laying in bed at kendra’s & i said wow I’ve been wanting one of these oil diffusers so bad i hear they’re good for your stress and such & she really went out of her way to buy me one& it may not seem like much but my bff listens and cares I’m so thankful for you @kendanell

9502 2018-12-24 03:46:05 It's Texas, dimwit. You know perfectly well that oil and gas are where the money is down there. Go pretend to slander someone who deserves it.

9508 2018-12-24 03:45:19 Keeps me up at night. The huge amounts of money that he and his family spend is staggering. Selling our public lands for oil drilling. He's not human...scary doesn't touch it, but I like your use of "nut for Potus!"
9509 2018-12-24 03:45:19 Not true.. just internal security of country is far far better than under UPA.. energy security far far better, both in power sector and in oil & gas sector.. inflation at record lows, which translates to money directly in our pockets.. many other such achievements
9510 2018-12-24 03:45:18 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor. Snake oil sellers don't last, but we've got lots. Nepal needs #education to rid of this pests & #soonWewill together

9512 2018-12-24 03:45:02 He took money from individuals.   It doesn’t matter that many (in Texas for god’s sake) work at oil and gas jobs (or at filling stations).  That isn’t him taking money from oil and gas corporations
9513 2018-12-24 03:44:42 President Trump just signed the Farm Act 2018, thus I hope to be allowed to extract CBD oil from hemp legally to help relieving your pain and my pain. I am looking into the possibility next and will be a farmer by end of next year hopefully :-)

9524 2018-12-24 03:43:23 Thinking about that time i used THC oil as lube
9525 2018-12-24 03:43:15 I don't trust Turkey.  They helped ISIS early on by helping sell the oil that helped finance ISIS.
9526 2018-12-24 03:43:08 1st get on an anti inflammatory diet. Even w/ meds it's so helpful. Intermittent fasting allows your gut to heal. I've been off meds for 15 years to see how I can control it through diet/stress relief, but I don't have to get photographed! THC/CBD 4 stress. Coconut n tea tree oil
9527 2018-12-24 03:42:56 @bubba_trading Wow, this guy knows so little about oil!  Maybe he is a good chart guy but he clearly knows very little about the industry.  Unfortunately, this narrative is what controls price short term... but clearly a generalist talking.
9528 2018-12-24 03:42:25 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
9529 2018-12-24 03:42:19 @pid_gov @ImranKhanPTI @ArifAlvi  Why are we not considering electric vehicles? Is it due to Power shortage, Oil cos lobby, or infrastructure limitations? Oil import bill n pollution can be reduced, Hybrid, Solar+grid, charging can be adopted. Research and studies required.
9530 2018-12-24 03:42:03 Lower stress, Ultra Violet Light, Vitamin E, Vaseline,Coconut Oil Organic, Apple Cider Vinegar, Tea Tree Oil,Witch Hazel and Primrose Oil really help. Try Probiotics you have to keep body very healthy. Keep a food diary for bad flare ups.  Love you  Merry Christmas &HHNY 4ever
9531 2018-12-24 03:42:02 The two you mention are the apparent ones. Oil industry is wrapped up w/CPC and MSM; both of whom are marching w/ the convoy. Organizers own oilfield-related outfits.
9532 2018-12-24 03:42:01 when you dilute your organic tea tree oil and people still ask what that smell is 
9533 2018-12-24 03:41:57 Go ahead & choke on that oil field trash.
9534 2018-12-24 03:41:52 President Cheney invaded Iraq to transfer control of some of the most productive conventional oil fields on earth to China and the international oil corporations including Halliburton- they have been operating on those fields ever since
9535 2018-12-24 03:41:48 I mean, this is correct. Of course Trump thinks the real mistake was we didn't steal their oil.
9536 2018-12-24 03:41:45 oil stains can fuck all the way off

9540 2018-12-24 03:41:23 I think that is an over-simplistic analysis.  Southern Tanzania suffered directly from Portuguese bombing but in the 1970s before the rise in oil prices and then Idi Amin's invasion, the economy was developing and we had many functioning factories.

9543 2018-12-24 03:40:58 The vehicles were made in eastern Canada, what do you expect? Of course he didn’t block it, now had they been made in western Canada that sale would have been canceled faster than you can say Saudi Oil...
9544 2018-12-24 03:40:49 @AndrewScheer and the @CPC_HQ can’t run using their previous record in government. So now they are scaring their supporters with border crossers, racism, oil woes and anything else they can think of. They know their supporters aren’t too bright and it seems to be working.

9550 2018-12-24 03:40:08 I did it for like 30 mins right out the shower, let them dry a bit then went over them again with hair oil & gel for an hour & a half.
9551 2018-12-24 03:40:05 I was more referring to the 75% of oil production that goes toward fuel. We can still have plastic under socialism don’t worry
9552 2018-12-24 03:40:03 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
9553 2018-12-24 03:40:03 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

9570 2018-12-24 03:37:02 I saw an obnoxious sticker on a heavy duty f250 truck (parked terribly ofc) that implied they were proud to be an "oil hog"... I've never wanted a @Tesla car more than I have today. I'm going to make damn sure my next vehicle is all electric. Need to do my part.
9571 2018-12-24 03:36:58 They think New York Senators should antagonize Wall Street, that North Dakota Senators should antagonize oil, and that West Virginia Senators should antagonize coal.

9605 2018-12-24 03:32:40 & yet you support an administration that treats Veterans poorly, refusing to provide adequate funding for the VA while spending ungodly amounts to buy new weapons. Do you think Jesus would agree with the killing of innocent people just to get their oil?

The attached gutter is opened from last 4 days. Are we searching any oil/gas here? because maintenance of the gutter usually don't take such time.

9617 2018-12-24 03:30:15 Anyone else up thinking about how demand for palm oil is leading to catastrophic deforestation?  :/

9619 2018-12-24 03:30:03 And what device did you send this tweet via? If you used a tablet/conputer/smartphone you have not only used an oil based product but you added to lithium-ion mining which is killing millions. You don't NEED a phone to survive so why do you hate the environment? Hypocrite

9622 2018-12-24 03:29:49 And it turns out the donors from gas and oil were mostly workers and some private donations from executives. Very small percentage.  They're grasping at straws. Research everything yourself this time.  Bots ya know.

9627 2018-12-24 03:29:06 Liz should have been deeply concerned when President Bush and her Dad allowed the American taxpayer to foot the entire bill for liberating Iraq without getting any restitution in the form of oil reserves oh that’s right her Dads company made money off of Iraq typically globalist

9629 2018-12-24 03:28:52 They call it oil sands because there is oil in the sand and it has been there for millions of years. The oil is getting extracted from the sand which is cleaning the environment keeping the oil from entering the rivers. The real crisis is people trying to stop the clean up.

9639 2018-12-24 03:27:44 Are you crazy? You think we need to continue the policy of regime change. Like that has worked so well. Syria never attacked us. There’s no real justification to be there aside from oil pipelines. And Obama’s proxy war there, funding Islamic extremists? You must be high.

9643 2018-12-24 03:27:17 Capital typically does correlate to economic power.  The USSR was on its way to failing, Reagan and the Saudis pushed them off the bridge by Reagan convincing the Saudis to produce more oil and tank the price.

9647 2018-12-24 03:26:52 I burnt my finger with hot oil making Struffoli, and my question is: will falling asleep with ice on my finger make it better/worse when I wake up in the morning ? 

*also* this hurts so bad ! 
9648 2018-12-24 03:26:13 The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want for nothing. He makes me lie down in the green pastures. He greases up my head with oil. He gives me kung-fu in the face of my enemies. Amen

9657 2018-12-24 03:24:54 What do Congo and Venezuela have in common? - Large oil reserves. Think about that each time you see big headlines in the media.

9659 2018-12-24 03:24:38 Jeez Eric, THIS IS NOISE.  Beto is interesting but flawed. He's good on the border mess but he takes lots of oil industry money. It's not even 2019 yet.  I am not a Sanders surrogate.

9662 2018-12-24 03:23:54 Am I the only one who said that the Saudi oil dump was only partly to destabilize western democracies, but mostly to avoid having a stranded asset?

9664 2018-12-24 03:22:52 If we want to be global stewards and leaders in climate change initiatives we should want to get our oil to the world markets. This will lower world GHG emissions. Canada wins and the world wins.

9669 2018-12-24 03:22:13 Hate to say it, bc I'm FOR pullout, bt Turkey's main target is & has always been the Kurds. Even when Turkey was supposedly fighting ISIS, they were really attacking Kurdish forces, not ISIS. Turkey was allowing ISIS free pass thru country & buying oil fm ISIS, not fighting ISIS.
9670 2018-12-24 03:21:56 We're only at the beginning of it. We're already seeing some signs, like plummeting oil prices (which seems good, but is actually a bad sign according to experts).
9671 2018-12-24 03:21:46 awesome, I took a shower today with water only and proud of it

the main complaint from others is bodily smell, but I realize now that soap is likely not necessary to solve that issue

deodarant (namely coconut oil) as per Trishank should hopefully do the trick

1) thoughts on CBD oil?
2) can you pack in in carry on without an issue?
9700 2018-12-24 03:17:06 Prairie Resilience plan doesn’t look like much of a solution especially when your still considering coal as a viable option.
The price of oil is so low right now. Even if there was a pipeline to tidewater, there would be still layoffs. You can’t blame everything on the Feds.
9701 2018-12-24 03:17:00 And they have the largest oil reserves in the world.

9713 2018-12-24 03:14:55 Honestly i really think that until other provinces work with us to get pipelines to tidewater, all revenues from oil should be excluded from equalization. Lets see how that calculation works out
9714 2018-12-24 03:14:49 I just watched a documentary how big oil... this song was all I could think of
9715 2018-12-24 03:14:48 Also...the latke should "swim" in veg oil, not fry on a greased pan or flat top. It's a fried pancake not grilled.
9716 2018-12-24 03:14:45 Oil ministers from leading #OPEC nations say they expect prices will arrest their recent slide and rebalance early next year, when a deal on new production cuts takes effect.
9717 2018-12-24 03:14:36 Haha yeah it’s a terrible description but jojoba oil works great when your skin produces crap oil that gives you zits all the time. Using jojoba oil cleared up my face completely
9718 2018-12-24 03:14:35 The solution is to withdraw all of our troops and their weapons from Iraq, Afganistan and Pakistan! We don't need mideast oil anymore, so let them kill each other! Then you can put the troops to work completing the southern border wall, as a matter of national defense!

9725 2018-12-24 03:13:29 FACT is that the world is using more oil and gas than ever before. Canada should be leading the world in providing energy to meet the demand. With this increased wealth and lowering global GHG emissions we would be able to invest further in our country.

9728 2018-12-24 03:12:51 I need some oil bruh
9729 2018-12-24 03:12:46 Yes it is highly likely actually because oil is starting to tank as well as people are just putting a lot of products on plastic.

9731 2018-12-24 03:12:40 'Certain' oil and gas companies (**cough***cough*** Suncor) want carbon pricing because that will keep smaller corporate participants out of the game and give ***cough***cough***Suncor exclusive access.

9741 2018-12-24 03:11:32 I really appreciate your passion, but saying ALL fish oil is full of heavy metals cuz oceans are contaminated is like saying ALL vegan sea vegetables (dulse, sea lettuce, kelp,  kombu) should be avoided for same reason. What say U? Can’t have it both ways? They do test, you know.
9742 2018-12-24 03:11:27 holding off at 4Q to raise was my stance as well. let's see how the profit taking shook out and reevaluate at the end of Q1 2019. remember oil and housings relationships to rates and the markets.

9748 2018-12-24 03:10:23 Don’t you mean take the oil back from the terrorists ? Since everyone in the north is a terrorist , the Syrian government is no better then any other Arab countries ,oppressing its people but when America intervened suddenly they are the bad guy ,the Kurds will comply for now
9749 2018-12-24 03:10:18 Which part? Beto is second behind Cruz in the amount of fossil fuel cash he takes? He held a fundraiser with a Oil CEO during the campaign.

9759 2018-12-24 03:08:50 I was just talking about this w/my niece today...they couldn't find any for Thanksgiving, but here are these crackers blanching collard greens & drizzling them w/olive oil. GTFOH
9760 2018-12-24 03:08:50 Of course he does.  He is not afraid to lead despite this being unpopular, even though Obama has done this before.  But we’ll set that aside for now.  America will not pay for this wall.  Perhaps in reduced federal funding to Mexico, a change in tariffs, some oil contracts.
9761 2018-12-24 03:08:40 How about next year marks 6 years since canadian traitors like Trudeau together with the international UN and NATO CABAL screwed up with Ukraine and as consequence , Russia tool over and destroyed the global oil market.

9768 2018-12-24 03:07:39 Sinus is my killer too. 
Lavender oil on your temples and glands..
Steam with a towel overhead
..this might sound stupid but if ya massage your hand, it can help your sinus.
9769 2018-12-24 03:07:32 Favorite quick green beans I made tonight:

Skillet, high heat
Lil bit of olive oil
Let oil get hot, toss in GBs
Sprinkle with kosher salt and black pepper
You want to blister those MF'ers. 
Toss a few times. 
When almost ready, add equal parts sriracha, brown mustard
Toss
Eat
9770 2018-12-24 03:07:29 sometimes there’s such a thing as too much olive oil...
9771 2018-12-24 03:07:28 drizzle olive oil, salt & pepper a bit, & add pancetta or bacon it’s one of my favorite dinners
9772 2018-12-24 03:07:27 Tea tree essential oil
9773 2018-12-24 03:07:26 The send the young off to kill and die, as they sit tight in their homes and rake in the spoils of war without a sweat. Always have, its their way of life. Lets hope we can put an end to it.  American lives are worth way more than oil and gold for the evil rich.
9774 2018-12-24 03:07:23 “As the reason for the carnage cut their meat and lick their gravy...
We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies...
The body bags and little rags of children torn in two, and the jelly brains of those who remain put the finger right on you...
As the madmen
9775 2018-12-24 03:07:13 Oh yes; peddling magic water to the gullable, condemning big pharma and medicine. All the while selling snake oil for £££. I find them deplorable.

9778 2018-12-24 03:06:33 He supports Israel and receives funding from oil and gas companies.
9779 2018-12-24 03:06:00 I think the fracker and oil driller in Chief Obama's record speaks for itself. TPP would have made it worse with no way out.
9780 2018-12-24 03:05:59 Just use oil
9781 2018-12-24 03:05:53 I feel like such a handy bitch when I put oil or coolant in my car or move a piece of furniture in my house.
9782 2018-12-24 03:05:51 You've never done anything altruistic in your life! You do things for your benefit first, and if it helps someone else, it's only by mistake! Your a con man, you sell snake oil, and that's what you'll be known for in history books! #TrumpResign #TrumpShutdown
9783 2018-12-24 03:05:48 Call it a Hanukah miracle; both used oil, right?
9784 2018-12-24 03:05:43 The pdga radio interview with the pdga president made me cringe so hard I am sore. He could not even comfortably answer a question clarifying the use of CBD oil during competition without getting nervous about politics & appearing socially conservative.

What.
9785 2018-12-24 03:05:36 Well one good step is we are now a net oil producer!
9786 2018-12-24 03:05:31 So Andy thinks Trudeau should nail the oil industry with the carbon taxes they deserve?
After all, they are the single largest source of pollution in Canada.
As a matter of fact, if there wasn't an oil industry, none of us would have to pay a carbon tax.

9792 2018-12-24 03:05:04 You might be spaced out, but have you ever been so spaced out you put white vinegar in the pan instead of canola oil? ‍
9793 2018-12-24 03:04:55 This is more along the lines of "noting that your car only has half the usual quantity of oil in it, dumping in an entire jug, and wondering why things are now going right to hell with your engine" if the worst-case scenarios are to be believed.
9794 2018-12-24 03:04:54 Haha after that you must’ve went home and washed all the dishes and vacuumed the house and changed the oil in their car and sweeper the roof 
9795 2018-12-24 03:04:49 ang tamlay namin kumain sa inasal wala ba namang chicken oil :/

9798 2018-12-24 03:04:35 @TheGabbieShow You mentioned in your recent vlogs about your breakouts. It was recommended to me to take iron supplements and I put tea tree oil on my face and it’s helped SO MUCH. Just a thought 
9799 2018-12-24 03:04:24 Vitamin E oil is great for your skin. It keeps it looking young and plump!
9800 2018-12-24 03:04:13 Vitamin C oil and Aztec secret have been saving my skin lately  my skin hates this bitch ass weather! #bestcombo #tryit
9801 2018-12-24 03:04:12 Try boiling oil.
9802 2018-12-24 03:04:12 couldn't even get it to heat up to melt the butter/ heat the oil at first.  then tried taking the metal thing out of the bottom which i guess is a steaming rack apparently?
9803 2018-12-24 03:04:01 Someone can extract oil from the sand, a thirsty deer may quench his thirst out of mirage, someone can even find a rabbit with horns but none can control mind of a foolish man and his adamancy.

9804 2018-12-24 03:03:51 Obama bragged about increasing United States oil production, he didn’t even attempt to wane us off fossils fuels
9805 2018-12-24 03:03:49 I should’ve brought my black seed oil
9806 2018-12-24 03:03:40 - Apply Vaseline to lashes everynight and/or before putting on mascara 
-Apply coconut oil to a cotton swab and apply to the lashes for 5-10 min before rinsing 
-1 tbsp castor oil, 1 tbsp aloe vera, mix together and apply to lashes evenly
9807 2018-12-24 03:03:22 Some magic happens when flour meets oil meets sugar with a bit of salt. As with baking bread, baking just preserved it. The raw form is the essential, pure, ideal form.
9808 2018-12-24 03:03:11 dari city color, kadang juga primer oil dsri city color  juga. Jadi foundation itu lebih nempel dan ga ngegeser. 
Abis itu kalau uda makeupnya kan harus di set,  nah gunanya setting spray itu biar makeupnya awet gitu gak melt. 
Tetep matte or tetep  dewy balik lg pemilihan -
9809 2018-12-24 03:02:59 The concerns being raised about donations to Beto from oil and gas - all raised from individual donors - are reminiscent of misleading attacks that Sanders made about Hillary Clinton. That he was willing to mislead like that bothered me, even while I still wanted him to win
9810 2018-12-24 03:02:51 Fill up with green vegetables(you can blend them in a smoothie to get more in), and you can suppress hunger by eating fewer refined carbs. Try just having meat, salad and some healthy oil or butter, see how long your stomach stays quiet
9811 2018-12-24 03:02:50 sad to see some on left is even quoting Chomsky out of context. He's simply stating if the US is really interested in humanitarian aid, not oil etc, the left should hold it to it by having a small presence, preventing an invasion. They of course offer no solution to save lives
9812 2018-12-24 03:02:45 Yet again, your bullshit "theory" was disproven well over half a decade ago. Ours is literally the vast majority consensus of those scientists not PAID BY THE OIL COMPANIES.
9813 2018-12-24 03:02:38 Actually transportation is second to oil production.

9815 2018-12-24 03:02:30 Doubtless that Erdogan is a despicable villain who FUNDED  them w oil trade - and all good points otherwise, but giving him 'credit' for creating ISIS???
9816 2018-12-24 03:02:28 Beto took $0 from PACs. He got individual donations from people who work in oil/energy. That includes my family, ppl who work to clean up after oil cos, ppl who are geologists, safety inspectors, receptionists, tech support, etc. Meanwhile, those of you who demand purity? CONSUME
9817 2018-12-24 03:02:26 Almost put aromatherapy oil into my drink instead of bitters.
9818 2018-12-24 03:02:19 What more to drop from these ultra low prices , eventually these fabricated prices by Trump pressure and Saudi's prince MBD of being blackmailed fir murder & his stupidity of pumping excess oil started all negativity.  When pessimism vanishes It'L be a totally different story.
9819 2018-12-24 03:02:03 Do men prefer back massages with body oil or some sort of lotion? 
9820 2018-12-24 03:01:50 2. We could shut down the entirety of Canadian industry (just just oil), and it wouldn’t even make a dent in global emissions. China’s year over year GROWTH is on par with the entirety of Canadian emissions.
9821 2018-12-24 03:01:50 Venezuelan gas? Their oil industry is so fubar they can't produce enough for domestic needs. Heavy crude output has fallen so low that at times the US refineries specializing in it have had to buy UK heavy crude. Looks way more like losing to me
9822 2018-12-24 03:01:48 tight line? pake baby oil aja
9823 2018-12-24 03:01:38 My go to meal the past couple days been smoothies, rice & spinach (palm oil), and corn dogs lol

9825 2018-12-24 03:01:30 Doug are you short oil?
9826 2018-12-24 03:01:23 By some I meant almost all of then have links to studies and articles. This is just in the category named vegetable oil. There are others related
9827 2018-12-24 03:00:38 170 dollars for 5 liters of oil and a filter change??? Korea is straight Robbin
9828 2018-12-24 03:00:34 1. Who’s ignoring climate science? The science is just irrelevant if demand is STILL increasing.  All other oil producing nations (who directly fund anti-Canadian oil activism)are laughing at us.

9832 2018-12-24 03:00:10 There is so much trade between Texas and Mexico how does he think this will pass and if it does Texas will haunt him on any oil deal he ever wants passed
9833 2018-12-24 02:59:57 Lesson: Never put coconut oil as alternative sa machine oil. Shuta nangamoy Biko ung electric fan 
9834 2018-12-24 02:59:47 Better tweet: Take a look at the site of future oil spill and another way we're actively contributing to climate change. We've lied about it for years, funded climate denial groups while planning for it internally. We knew we were causing this crisis, but care more about profit.

9839 2018-12-24 02:58:57 The person on the left in the background is wearing specially ordered cut/ impact resistant gloves used for oil patch work. They are the exact gloves that are mandatory (and supplied) when working new construction pipeline. #capitalism
9840 2018-12-24 02:58:54 I am interested in your CBD oil for chronic pain.
9841 2018-12-24 02:58:39 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
9842 2018-12-24 02:58:24 I got Safflower oil from the store and bought special deeper tins, so hopefully that will work? Yours turned out beautiful, nice and puffy.
9843 2018-12-24 02:58:00 Can you explain why in the the heck ANY young person should trust Beto to prevent fossil fuels from turning our world into Hothouse Earth when Beto took the MAX $2,700 donation from 30 fossil execs and voted to open offshore oil exploration? #ActOnClimate #GreenNewDeal #NoBeto
9844 2018-12-24 02:57:49 Yeah. She’s a moderate. About to drill for oil in a wildlife sanctuary.
9845 2018-12-24 02:57:46 That's understandable. :( I was nervous about the oil in the pan, too. I debated which one to use and went with avocado.
9846 2018-12-24 02:57:26 Since when cbc cares about the economy of an oil town now? These dark money is all sin!!
9847 2018-12-24 02:57:09 Or maybe try mixing a little cannabis oil in your puppy's food
9848 2018-12-24 02:56:47 Drink some olive oil. It may prevent alcohol poisoning.

9850 2018-12-24 02:56:11 I love that our punditry class is so rich that they don’t understand how payroll works. They’ve never had the thought “Thank God I get paid tomorrow so I can get groceries.” They’re just use to swiping their debit card and having money there.
9851 2018-12-24 02:55:51 Trust me. You literally cannot distinguish the sound between boiling oil and the footsteps basketball players on the court
9852 2018-12-24 02:55:50 だね〜元気だった？？
9853 2018-12-24 02:55:41 #opec #oil                      Watch oil prices move up.
9854 2018-12-24 02:55:31 Day at St. Charles Christmas Traditions . So much fun and I felt like I was in a Hallmark movie all day. I was also able to get fresh oil perfume “Goddess” at Bathhouse Soapery & Caldarium and an annual Zecher ornament for 2018 that was laser engraved.
9855 2018-12-24 02:55:27 Beto is for Medicare for all. You can literally google this. Also the “oil and gas” donations thing is hugely misleading. He took no corporate money. Many of his small donors do work in oil and gas, which is hardly unusual since those are Texas’ largest employers
9856 2018-12-24 02:54:53 Been looking at the oil, thanks for the suggestion
9857 2018-12-24 02:54:51 I grew up in poverty.  But you go ahead and keep pretending that Bernie is my savior.  Snake oil salesmen like him are a dime a dozen.  Actions speak louder than words.  Bernie will never get my vote.
9858 2018-12-24 02:54:51 Tempted to just fix the oil pan issue and drive the accord tomorrow
9859 2018-12-24 02:54:43 As words came bumbling out of his mouth, the Aus DF are like a good curry, first you add oil and then .... I thought, ‘Bloody hell. He thinks he’s clever, funny even’.
I’m glad they fitted him out in a vest 3 sizes too small and a cap with a big C on it.
9860 2018-12-24 02:54:33 Ok one more lol ...Psalms 92:10    “But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.”
9861 2018-12-24 02:54:27 Hey millennials stop buying tuna fish in waster & start buying it in oil.  You’ll love it again
9862 2018-12-24 02:54:22 THEN there's also the issue I have with just similar sounding words:

"palm oil" → "manteca de carajo"
"I'm really tired" → "estoy bien sábado"
9863 2018-12-24 02:54:20 they actually didn't taste too bad. I just didn't know the cooking oil was mixed with coconut so there was a lot of smoke. I haven't tried them since then, too scared something else would go wrong.
9864 2018-12-24 02:54:20 When I worked at an Olive Garden in college eons ago, the kitchen kept the breadsticks in a big drawer full of warm oil. Like, literally swimming in oil. I found it odd, but maybe that's "authentico?"
9865 2018-12-24 02:54:13 อื้อ แบบนั้นเลยคิดว่าต้องกลับมาละเริ่มแพลนทริปใหม่มันก็ทำให้รู้สึกดีขึ้นมาทันที ฮ่าา

9868 2018-12-24 02:53:36 Try Aloevera gel mixed with olive oil. Put is on your plates for 30min to 1 hour and wash. I am using it right now and it seems working.
9869 2018-12-24 02:53:27 I got a essential oil diffuser with 4 different essential oils for Christmas, i’m forever going to be one relaxed bitch
9870 2018-12-24 02:53:26 I’ve only been home for 10 minutes & Twan is already asking me to oil her scalp and retwist her dreads. Who does she think I am?
9871 2018-12-24 02:53:10 It's pure hysteria. My theory, for what it's worth, is that the menfolk who consider the oil industry their machismo refuge are upset that it may not be one forever.
9872 2018-12-24 02:53:08 Bonnet should be boiled in oil.
9873 2018-12-24 02:53:01 The United Nations is worthless. Where are the UN peacekeepers to fight these atrocities happening to the Palestinians? I bet if that area had oil everyone would be concerned. The UN countries that watch this barbarity from Israel make me sick.
9874 2018-12-24 02:52:49 Just one more group Truduh has alienated this year. It's hard to "kiss and make up" when he ignores war victims, oil and gas workers, call centre workers, dairy workers, then labels opponents of illegal migration as racist.

9878 2018-12-24 02:52:05 In the meantime, China leads the way in solar energy production.  And nations are weaning off of oil.  Being the leading oil producer is not only short-sighted it is a stain on humanity itself.

9885 2018-12-24 02:51:38 Sirota is trolling and his priority is about electing his favorite politician. There are multiple candidates in the democratic primary who would make fighting climate change a top issue. 

And guess what? Bernie's also taken $$$ from people who work in the oil and gas industry.

エキストラバージンオリーブオイルとはオリーブの果実を搾ってろ過しただけのバージンオイルです。
9888 2018-12-24 02:51:16 Outside it would have been much worse. Do you imagine buying oil and gas in the market with a weak devaluated currency instead of euros? What about savings with a devaluated currency? What about financing our deficit in the markets without ECB support?
9889 2018-12-24 02:51:08 Btw bright and early a morning mi a call MOCA, deh PetroJam sumn deh still nuh sort out and the last time mi see politics man inna tiny hype car him lose 6billion dollar worth a oil.
9890 2018-12-24 02:50:53 Obama also bragged about helping the US become an even more greater oil producer (ally to fossil fuel) which if continues for the next 12 years our planet is doomed. Thank god!

9894 2018-12-24 02:50:15 Why would it spike on a Sunday night? Oil will go up as inventories start coming down and/or SP500 rises. Mkt sentiment is holding risky assets in limbo.

9898 2018-12-24 02:49:41 Which is the point.  It's more like an oil tank than the oil itself
9899 2018-12-24 02:49:37 @narendramodi @PMOIndia @arunjaitley @dpradhanbjp Even after the drop in crude oil in mkt we dont see petrol going below rs75.

9901 2018-12-24 02:49:11 OPEC hasn't flinched in the face of Trump tweets. His last 2-3 tweets regarding oil had no effect on the price of oil.

9903 2018-12-24 02:49:04 Besides destroying PDVSA, another  crime vs Venezuela  done by Chavez /Maduro and PSUV was to surrender Esequibo Zone under Reclamation and its offshore oil rich area to Guyana. Exxon-Mobil found a giant field there in 2018 and now Guyana owns it
9904 2018-12-24 02:49:00 So you didn't read the sludge article?  After his "no oil/gas $$" pledge, Beto accepted over 2 dozen max donations ($2700) from oil/gas *execs* - not window washers or floor moppers.
So Beto is honest or he isn't.  That's important to sort out before dem primary, yes?
9905 2018-12-24 02:48:58 Non-lethal police ideas:
1. Glitter cannon
2. Replace night sticks with 24” double-headed dildos
3. Taser activates after breakaway tactical pants are removed
4. Pepper essential oil diffuser
5. Synchronized karaoke/dance choreography street-clearing tactics
6. K9 puppy patrol
9906 2018-12-24 02:48:55 Big Beto secret is:he didn’t care about immigration crisis on his border until @SenJeffMerkley @RepJayapal were down there for months showing the country; they are still on it he’s silent; & he’s more in bed with oil & gas than he’d ever want us to know. So much for Green Deal.

9909 2018-12-24 02:48:18 The whole MIddle East is such a complex mess...I can't keep up. It's got to be about more than oil,  but I am not so sure.

9911 2018-12-24 02:48:05 My prediction.  Known of #btc when it was $8 bought at $130 I see it staying flat or going lower.  If Blockchain satellites and lightning begin, you could see wide scale adoption in third world countries.  Japan meltdown or sharp Saudi oil export decline could also spike price.
9912 2018-12-24 02:47:58 They're part of the Bakken oil fields operation. Pretty sure the only thing they really care about is money and they have virtually no public or commercial exposure.
