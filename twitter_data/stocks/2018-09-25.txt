48 2018-09-25 23:41:17 You lost 2% in purchase power, yes. But your dollars would have lost 3% of purchase power if you left your money in dollars. Inflation is harmful, and your solution is... buy stocks???

Yes there is real money to be made in the speculative phase of cannabis stocks

But when everything goes live on October 17th in Canada there's very few stores that will be selling product

First earnings reports should be disappointing

Growth will come
61 2018-09-25 23:27:47 The Canadian dollar is now pinned to weed stocks
62 2018-09-25 23:26:22 It is my view that just about all reputable U stocks are a bargain right now. So if you can get them cheaper that is even better but trading like that is hard on my nerves so I tend not do do it Sit back with a beverage and just watch. Don't want to be rich and a basket case eh!
63 2018-09-25 23:25:04 It is always a bullish factor when people are afraid of stocks because of high P/Es.  The fear is in the market already.  It’s when there is no fear you should be fearful.
64 2018-09-25 23:24:39 public REITs have generally been pretty worthless as a static allocation – they exhibit similar behavior to small cap stocks. In a tactical strategy, they can provide significant value. Private CRE, since quarterly liquid, is difficult to employ tactically...

66 2018-09-25 23:23:01 There is a meaningful difference between public and private REITs. Public REITs are stocks of RE companies and are thus subject to public equity beta (VNQ beta ~.8) while private RE funds, since they are not listed, are going to be valued (and in turn bid/offered) based on the...

77 2018-09-25 23:11:22 @AskRobinhood Hi, for some reason a bunch of stocks I had bought is no longer listed under one of the stocks, meaning that my portfolio went down in value despite no such thing occurring, why was this?
78 2018-09-25 23:10:58 Correct. The necessity ponts the other way. Rising rates don’t always prevent stock from going down. Just removes an obstacle. Rates momentum turned negative two years ago, stocks are yet to turn down. Similar picture to ‘07 in that respect.
79 2018-09-25 23:10:55 I'm trying to trade U3O8 Stocks like $EU and $UUUU during this volatility to accumulate more shares. Is that a good idea, cause we do know then the bull is gonna start.
80 2018-09-25 23:10:48 How well do you know your #financial terms? Let's start with stocks, mutual funds, index funds, etf funds..... Guess what? Most financial books do a really poor job of explaining these terms in easy to digest language. #Ottawa #WomensMoneyGroup

82 2018-09-25 23:09:41 Yes, I think 7 stocks have been carrying this market 
83 2018-09-25 23:09:32 So what to do with your stocks if it breaks resistance or support maybe?
84 2018-09-25 23:08:36 It sure will WT. It is a sad fact that many will not be able to handle the coming volatility. Stocks will not go straight up..they never do and they never will but it will knock the impatient investor out and that is so sad for them. Patience and exit plan are key.
85 2018-09-25 23:07:56 MAGAs can't boycott what most don't use.

Not a #MAGA boycott, several videos to make people aware.

What.
86 2018-09-25 23:07:39 I don’t think we need assault-style/ AR / bump stocks. I’m ok with guns for sport. I want background check for all and a waiting period. To me this is common sense. Unless someone can give me compelling evidence against, it seems to me places w some gun control exp less violence.

88 2018-09-25 23:06:49 Many investors believed that some stocks cannot fail- that the only way is up-that valuations do not matter. Such people have had a rude shock lately. I think that some stocks irrespective of their marketcap size and trading at very high valuations will have a tryst with reality
89 2018-09-25 23:06:06 Great. Embrace higher taxes, higher unemployment, lower stocks (that’s your 401K kids), give money to hostile governments so they’ll like us and maybe not bomb our buildings, let jobs go overseas. Jeez, grow the F*** up!!!
90 2018-09-25 23:03:42 You can get rich by making the ultra rich work for you - buy and hold the stocks of the companies they are running. They will make sure you profit from it by hook or by crook. Just be patient with them.

107 2018-09-25 22:51:11 How do i buy stocks 
108 2018-09-25 22:50:00 Lesson I learned the hard way:

Until you have $100k in the bank, "investing" is a waste of time.

Stocks, bonds, crypto, etc.

None have better returns than an actual business.

Instead, invest in your skillset.

Build a business.

Stack cash.

Then invest.
109 2018-09-25 22:49:46 I got my Model 3 almost 2 months ago my family liked car a lot and we purchased also Tesla stocks to show our support Tesla. We believe in you Elon
110 2018-09-25 22:49:41 23? WTF? I liked your book but must say I am going to lose some respect for you and attribute a lot to luck. I'm 52 and have been in crypto 5 years, stocks 35 years. You just HAVEN'T seen enough bear markets in your life to be an expert. Takes a good few (or 30 years).
111 2018-09-25 22:49:37 Interested in #stocks?  Please follow our friends @StockInvestorD3 #investors #stockupdates #stockvideos #podcasts #smallcaps #publiccompanies
112 2018-09-25 22:48:17 At times when the market gets shaky, the ill-liquid stocks seem to present an opportunity (volume and your buy price). But the journey seeems to be very lonely with no co-passengers. An ideal recipe for an “YEAR 3 INVESTING” strategy that you keep talking about.
113 2018-09-25 22:46:48 You can construct a pretty decent model for consumer confidence using gas prices at the pump and the level of the S&P. So to your point, high stocks and consumer confidence are simply reflexive.
114 2018-09-25 22:46:14 Weed Stocks? Having seen what happens when you get high and behind the wheel, and what it does it your mind, why would anyone legalize that? Not talking about using it medically for pain, here.
115 2018-09-25 22:45:32  Have a look these #stocks that marked all-time highs: $ANDV, $PHG

117 2018-09-25 22:44:08 Sorry to hear that! 53.31 in my opinion was the correct buy point. It broke out yesterday & stop would go <51. Entering at 55.70 is already extended from it's base.  FOMO/chasing extended stocks rarely works. Been there/done that/made every mistake in the book! Hope that helps!

70% like ACA, 
97% want gun background checks, 
82% want bump stocks outlawed
68% don't want Roe withdrawn
87% support DACA
40% liked 2017 tax cut.
121 2018-09-25 22:39:57 The world should just sanction us back, and I mean a full house, and go slap slap you go to the mat and bingo bango, no oil, no extra food, no tea from india or china, No buy US T bonds, No buy land, no pay mortgages on land, fire sell all US comp stocks.  They could do it
122 2018-09-25 22:39:55 Trump himself has stated that if Democrats win they will be violent.

Just watch the NRA press machine spooge out "They're Coming For Your Guns!" as well.

I mean, they pushed back on Bump Stock Regulation...

people were mowed down, and they wanted to defend bump stocks...

127 2018-09-25 22:36:04 I remain disappointed in #TaxScam and your delusional voting for corporations over Ohio constituents. Corporations using tax jackpot to buy back stocks and executive raises while deficit blows up. WellsFargo, At&T, Tesla, GM, Carrier, Pfizer, Comcast, Walmart, Harley, etc...

134 2018-09-25 22:27:28 What objective evidence suggest so? There isn’t one thing I can price the long bond in on a relative basis that isn’t downright scary. Try it! Price it in every curency. Price it relative to stocks, oil, etc... Bonds are a disaster IMO
135 2018-09-25 22:27:16 It credit card debt. Maybe he cashed in a 401, sold some stocks, sold a rental property. Maybe someone in the family died and left him money, maybe an investment, maybe he sold a boat. Why? What does that mean?

164 2018-09-25 22:05:10 The day has come. You can end the rumors. Value bourbon just died a little today. Due to demand of its stocks, @HeavenHill1935: "we made the decision to eliminate sales of Heaven Hill Six-Year-Old Bottled-In-Bond Kentucky Straight Bourbon altogether."
165 2018-09-25 22:04:11 This is utter nonsense. A quick internet search will show you that wage growth has barely moved, with some saying it’s even fallen. Major corporations have used their tax breaks to buy back billions in stocks. 

Enough with the talking points, we see right through them.

177 2018-09-25 21:53:03 I'm not using a scanner like Finviz (yet), for now I'm sticking to manually scanning all the charts of my mega caps list with my own eyes. I think that helps me a lot to develop a quick technical eye. Maybe later I will use scanners to pick stocks.
178 2018-09-25 21:51:53 Highly recommend investors business daily. They charge a monthly fee but they know what they’re doing. Almost all the stocks I’ve bought were recommended by them.
179 2018-09-25 21:51:02 For now I'm mostly focussing on the mega market cap stocks, because that's mostly where most of the volume is and where most of the eyes are on. A bigger crowd can cause bigger break-outs/-downs.
180 2018-09-25 21:50:39 I think we collectively are consenting to anything whatsoever coming from this company is gamed and manipulated beyond any ethical or moral boundary. Beyond Madoff, Worldcom, Enron, Theranos... stocks fall of their own weight. This one looks about as heavy as they come.

210 2018-09-25 21:27:28 no. Bull markets are about narratives. Individual stocks maybe. Quality over quantity for longer-dated.Future is more important, but we rely on the past predictively.

230 2018-09-25 21:19:16 What other stocks?  My point is that the “$6 billion” story that has been trending is half baked reporting.

I commend the Fed for the progress they’ve made so far

But interest rates are popping higher and it’s rattling markets, from stocks & bonds to real estate and biz loans.

Only way to get that passion and history back is give it to an ex player in my opinion. I’d like to see that, something different. Won’t happen, some other big name will come it and try spend a fortune
277 2018-09-25 21:01:50 Who cares? I have enough to worry about with stocks and stuff in life

285 2018-09-25 20:59:23 @SomaHands well then were on the same page. My emotions are frozen. But the stocks I own live and breathe
286 2018-09-25 20:59:00 I smell another FA cup exit at the hands of the mighty whites. Mate we’re never coming back up, doomed!   I agree regards the players, but his style of play doesn’t help etc
287 2018-09-25 20:58:19 Man the majority of them on the Canadian market unfortunately. You know about reporting stocks from other countries with your taxes 
288 2018-09-25 20:57:38 I'm looking at what stocks of Asian NOR players like Macronix have done lately.. what makes $CY different in your opinion?
289 2018-09-25 20:57:38 Do you have any witnesses?
No do you know where or when? No. Did you ever say anything ever? No. But now 1 week b4 vote. Shamefully weakening the #MeToo movement. How’s Keith Ellison lately?
290 2018-09-25 20:57:23 They had the best services, quality and stocks. Just like their Motto, you need it, we got it
291 2018-09-25 20:56:53 The government cost me over $3400 when they passed the ACA in order to "redistribute" health care. $127 is nothing compared to the costs of progressives and their insane ideas.
292 2018-09-25 20:55:48 I miss my stocks and investments loosing money...........NOT! Thank you President Trump!
293 2018-09-25 20:55:30 I expected the same against Brighton and Wolves but that shit out! Jose will get the blame but players have to take responsibility. That team was plenty good enough tonight. Give it another 5 years when you boys finally make it and you can dick us as well.!
294 2018-09-25 20:55:27 When you say "you believe survivors", you are stating you do not believe in the presumption of innocence and that anyone accused of sexual crimes is automatically guilty, regardless of evidence.
295 2018-09-25 20:55:26 I've long since given up on trying to accurately predict when things will go up or down.  Just do my DD, place my bets and for the best :)  Sounds counter intuitive but I like it when stocks I love drop as it allows me to buy more.  Obviously if you're wrong it's not so good :)
296 2018-09-25 20:54:21 -$1000 should have been an easy day. -16.5k last 4 days combined, which is fine as I am still far green above that for the last couple weeks but red days in a row is annoying. Picking the right stocks just playing it wrong and sloppy/greedy as well as there being many shakeouts
297 2018-09-25 20:53:59 Twitter will miss all of us once Trump leaves office. Watch the stocks plummet
298 2018-09-25 20:53:47 It’s funny how you put weird time frames everytime... lol
299 2018-09-25 20:53:44 Prepare for another Great Recession to follow.  Without the US generating real revenue, this is just a spending spree on credit cards & our children's future. Don't believe the hype. The Bull Market is the 1% buying back stocks.  It is an unsustainable bubble...an illusion.

307 2018-09-25 20:51:09 Consumer confidence is at an 18 year high. What happened after it reached that peak? Oh right the dot com bubble. If you have money in get it out before a major correction hits. If you don’t have money in short some stocks 
308 2018-09-25 20:50:45 But we are shit though so I don’t know what more you expect?!

319 2018-09-25 20:46:26 You can own stocks, but like the Venezuelan market, stocks won't keep up with a failing currency. I am a gold guy, because I think the global fiat system is completely unsustainable. You can see the problems in these oscillating debt crises of increasing intensity.
320 2018-09-25 20:45:59 sounds like refineries are starting to fall asleep.  If so, surprising that gasoline stocks would be up.
321 2018-09-25 20:45:32 @AdamMancini4 I am a bit puzzled that GDX has not rallied more given the upward moves in mining stocks due to consolidation in the industry.    Can you please share your thoughts on this?    Thanks in advance.

340 2018-09-25 20:36:58 That's a lie, didn't happen. Facts are facts. Unemployment is lowest in history across all demographics. GDP approaches 4.2% (Obama told us to get used to 1%.) Europeans are now paying $Billions in their share toward NATO. N. Korea is being tamed. Taxes, lower. Stocks higher, etc

345 2018-09-25 20:33:59 What’s your obsession with the word jealousy?  Envy is not a very Christian thing.  Since you love the 1% so much, I guess you’re ecstatic over Wells Fargo taking their tax cuts, buying back stocks, and laying off 26,000 people.  That’s real MAGA there.
346 2018-09-25 20:33:42 Increasing ones net worth is a slow process. If today you have a net worth of $100,000 between cash, stocks, and real estate equity, thats great. But if tomorrow you sell your $450k home and pay 6%, now your net worth is $73,000. You've unnecessarily undone years of progress.

354 2018-09-25 20:29:33 "They" say you shouldn't frequently check on your stocks. (A watched pot never boils etc.) So what I now do is ignore mine and check on other people's stocks repeatedly.
355 2018-09-25 20:27:49 Your mighty masters are watching you very carefully! You shall submit! Did they also offer you stocks options? Did they also mention you may qualify for a trip to fhloston Paradise? Lol
356 2018-09-25 20:26:57 1) you misunderstood QE, there was no money created, only reserves and reserves are not money 2) if your inflation thesis is that the US dollar collapses I’m just curious if you own any other assets? Are you long stocks in that environment?
357 2018-09-25 20:26:48 $EDRY This a good reminder that only 1 out of a million stocks stocks turns out like $TLRY and why you need to assure profit when it's there
358 2018-09-25 20:26:33 Yes. Start with an S&P 500 index fund. First 10k you invest should be here. Individual stocks should make up a small %.
359 2018-09-25 20:26:22 @SomaHands actually your totally wrong. Stocks have enormous emotion and sentiment values.
360 2018-09-25 20:25:35 It’s more subtle than that. The point that I see and agree with, is that TCJA provided an immediate vehicle to raise profits, but no incentive/constraint to raise salaries or headcount.

Those deficiencies are part of why TCJA polls poorly, even though stocks & buybacks go up.

389 2018-09-25 20:10:58 Yes, common knowledge is velocity of move is what matters to rising yields. Yields move too fast, stocks get spooked. But what matters more is "why" and "what" are they chasing. Rising to tamper growth is good. Rising to fend off inflation not good.

393 2018-09-25 20:10:03 My penny stocks going hard rn
394 2018-09-25 20:10:00 Who kno about stocks
395 2018-09-25 20:08:26 thx @bespokeinvest The other peaks were good times to sell stocks. #BakesTakes_
396 2018-09-25 20:08:12 Thank God for the #FANG stocks...
397 2018-09-25 20:07:44 @jimcramer What are you thoughts on the Defensive stocks outlook here? Like NOC? Looking into 3-6 months time frame.
398 2018-09-25 20:07:41 $192 ????     that's daylight robbery. 
The irony of your oil stocks going up.
399 2018-09-25 20:07:33 @timothysykes Hi Tim, I'm a guy from Sweden trying to learn how to trade penny stocks. Reading the complete penny stock course right now and loving it! But I've been trying to find some information about how it works to trade the US market from Europe? Or trade hereusingsamestrat
400 2018-09-25 20:07:21 Anyone know any good stocks to invest in?
401 2018-09-25 20:07:07 Say Hello To Yellow specials for this week starting today until Tuesday 02/10/18 or while stocks last!!
402 2018-09-25 20:07:02 Mr. Stocks's bus is running around 10 minutes behind this evening.
403 2018-09-25 20:06:09 I'm down 3.5% This month so feel your pain. Hard to swallow when a lot of the Twitter folk are talking about ath and riding the hot stocks. I'm still just above 30% ytd so can't complain.  Lots of snatching at profits going in which is making portfolio management difficult
404 2018-09-25 20:06:03 I think what may be a bit different, is the fact that everyone is drowning in debt today. So higher rates may not necessarily be a good thing for stocks.
405 2018-09-25 20:05:45 Until further notice cannabis stocks are trash investments for speculators. We need more info. Revenues must grow. I’m worried about major growing pains.
406 2018-09-25 20:04:58 Weired. Actually when stocks move up/down in reality their sectors moves them.... pairing within same sector may be risky....
407 2018-09-25 20:04:29 Top stocks to watch tomorrow:

$ADXS $AVEO $NSPR $CEI $AKER $PXS $JAGX $CGIX $LMFA $AGRX $GBR $AMD $WWR $CTIC $AMDA $SLS $EDRY $JONE $PHII
408 2018-09-25 20:03:57 I don’t have the numbers but they are available. The loan allowed them to pay off high interest loans and use the savings to invest into n the mill and DL Power - about $30 million spent on replacing pen stocks and generators so far I believe. A very wise investment.
409 2018-09-25 20:03:25 Its like saying,

"just because the investment specialist lost all your retirement money betting on the wrong stocks in 2008, doesnt mean (s)he was wrong, because (s)he used available data at that time"

- wrong predication is still = wrong
410 2018-09-25 20:03:11 Jeez, I'm checking stocks in high time-frames and I just wish I had a billion dollar #HedgeFund...I would make my clients insanely rich in a few years. Your principles made me another person @RayDalio, YOU ARE MY IDOL. #Hedgers #ShortSellingIsFun

414 2018-09-25 20:01:42 £50 max fine for the use of glitter, double if it’s on a card or wrapping paper. If found to be listening to music on public transport without headphones, put in stocks for 24 hours. If you refer to music released between 1995 and 2000 as an oldie, compulsory tar and feathering.
415 2018-09-25 19:59:09 Same with financial trading, it's all about promising value to attract pple to buy stocks.

419 2018-09-25 19:54:53 No, you and your billionaire buddies are richer. Stocks are up and wages are down 17% since 2000. And you got laughed at today in front of every other important world leader.
420 2018-09-25 19:54:29 I will continue to cheerlead my AMD stocks as im waiting for a product announcement to sell
421 2018-09-25 19:52:17 $PTOTF - not a pot stocks, even though ticker looks like it might be.  Great chart, great management, HIGH need product that I hope accomplishes the goal. #notapotstock

how you are able to show your face to your followers is what surprising me a lot, God bless you
423 2018-09-25 19:51:59 Can we get the stocks back?
424 2018-09-25 19:51:28 #Stocks,#Indexes Not going to happen.
425 2018-09-25 19:48:59 Stocks boi get with it
426 2018-09-25 19:48:51 I would argue it's far more profound. Tesla combines misinformation that began w/ politics (climate change), a deeply passionate industry (car lovers & eventual nostalgia from gas/engines), & finally CNBC/Bloomberg idiots..they cover 3k stocks & only reach superficial levels
427 2018-09-25 19:48:50 Maybe a bit silly but I figure it can't hurt to ask--why not try pumping out *sterile* hatch salmon stocks for emergency feedings when ocras are in area? Tradeoffs may be worth it with the headache of "hand feedings".

430 2018-09-25 19:46:53 .... and Robert, thus far there is little evidence that there has been much of a trickle down effect by his tax cuts.  Corporations are still hoarding their money in a variety of ways.  The compensation that CEO’s will receive at year end will be eyepopping because of stocks
431 2018-09-25 19:46:22 People who make liquorice flavoured biscuits should be put in the stocks and pelted with rotting pigeon carcasses. #GBBO
432 2018-09-25 19:45:58 S&P flat to red yet outstanding day, growth stocks rocking!
433 2018-09-25 19:43:36 and stocks fell .. amazingly tremendously and at the same time they were all time high said mr DJT..
434 2018-09-25 19:43:30 @ayyk92 single handedly shot the price up of Nintendo's stocks. So congrats, I guess.
435 2018-09-25 19:43:03 Do you prefer stocks, options, or both?
436 2018-09-25 19:42:50 Hi Elliot. If it is just for the purposes of a refund, then there will be no issue. However if you wish to have it exchanged for a replacement, it would need to be taken to a store which stocks the item. Hope that helps! Mark.
437 2018-09-25 19:41:43 Congrats Julian

439 2018-09-25 19:40:33 So should I be buying Pinterest stocks? Asking for a friend.
440 2018-09-25 19:38:19 Caching and Data Sync is taking a look at a sample stock trade app with 4,000 stocks in real time! #nxStep with @OutSystems.
441 2018-09-25 19:37:54 Accusers is one thing creditable accusers with evidence is another. Stick to pushing penny stocks.
442 2018-09-25 19:37:50 Another recommendation. Wait a bit for Intel stocks to flatline, then throw money into it. Also sell Apple and Amazon stocks.
443 2018-09-25 19:36:44 Oh no my Versace stocks 
444 2018-09-25 19:36:21 For sure. I’m adding dml at .75 and will add more if it drops into the end of the month. Great potential for American stocks with the section 232 decision coming up...uec hasn’t had a big move yet and I’m looking for good things there. Just my 2 cents!
445 2018-09-25 19:35:39 Tuna, opah, and mackerel sharks are the only species of fish that can maintain a body temperature higher than that of the surrounding water. As a result of overfishing, stocks of some tuna species, such as the southern bluefin tuna, are close to extinction.
446 2018-09-25 19:35:34 cc j’ai pas suivis votre débat mais juste pour vous dire qu’après avoir contacté asos directement la diff de prix est liée au stock qui varie etc, et uniquement au niveau des stocks voilà bisous bisous
447 2018-09-25 19:34:55 Sorry as a rule i dont recommend stocks !!

Liability of someone else's loss due to my recommendation is not a burden i want to carry.

Though occasionally i tweet about the stocks i am holding. Do your own research, any doubts you can knock here.
448 2018-09-25 19:34:35 Personal recommendation, for stock people. Sell NVIDIA Stocks. Note I said this 9/24/18.
449 2018-09-25 19:33:48 Lol 3 stocks
450 2018-09-25 19:33:13 why are stocks so fun
451 2018-09-25 19:33:01 As for Economy, its great if you own stocks. Most people do not. The average worker's pay under Trump has not kept up with inflation, so they are earning less. 40%+ of working families cannot pay basic bills every month: housing, utility, clothing, and food. Get some facts please
452 2018-09-25 19:32:58 Wish it would hurry up, my stocks are quickly diminishing that I bought in Toronto during the summer!!!
453 2018-09-25 19:32:56 I WILL PUT YOU IN THE STOCKS
454 2018-09-25 19:32:50 I just loved 1/3 of my stocks to cnd banks.
455 2018-09-25 19:32:40 Want to do stocks this time
456 2018-09-25 19:31:06 I've seen it before, but the FDA measure is not overall response rate, it's objective response rate. To be specific it's really known as objective overall response rate, and it's a predetermined amount they're measuring. They seem to shorten as they see fit, can be misleading.
457 2018-09-25 19:30:11 Same here but that happens a lot in stocks
458 2018-09-25 19:30:02 ششششش لاتفضحنا 
459 2018-09-25 19:27:58 Not good for Hemp stocks. Massive drop until talks pick up again
460 2018-09-25 19:27:20 Sir, no news is good news in this market,
461 2018-09-25 19:26:48 Analysts make up higher and higher price targets as these high forward multiple stocks go up and oblivious market buys their BS yet again. These spoiled analysts get away with as much as they can until they get on. But, until that happens it's free $ for them and their friends.
462 2018-09-25 19:25:53 First Analysis stated it at strong buy -- they only do that with stocks they have a position in... and usually a big one.
463 2018-09-25 19:25:37 Trouble for autos. BMW warned that US-China trade tiff will hurt its profits. $BMWYY down 5%. $GM $F $FCAU stocks shifting into reverse too.

465 2018-09-25 19:23:04 Instead of obsessing about the FAANG stocks, maybe you should have bought uniforms instead? $CTAS up 320% last 5 yrs. $FB and $AAPL up 221%.
466 2018-09-25 19:22:35 where can I buy stocks of this little speed demon  Jokes aside, good luck :)
467 2018-09-25 19:22:31 Same. My brother checked his stocks after 3months in the marines while I was trying to find the most eco-friendly caculator watch to buy
468 2018-09-25 19:22:21 What does this mean? I'm a rookie learning. Does the mean the pot stocks will fall drastically because of the competition?
469 2018-09-25 19:21:38 They continuously confuse OS with ORR (overall survival vs objective response rate), and it does not help their cause when things like this happen. But, because people don't understand, which I said was going to happen weeks ago, here we are.
470 2018-09-25 19:21:00 Who paid for by Crooked Hillary got elected, your stocks would be yet another all-time Record.

477 2018-09-25 19:18:40 I don't trust those of you hyping, and pumping stocks on Twitter... I feel sad for those who buy in high after those of you in the chat rooms already bought in super low just to dump them at the same time
478 2018-09-25 19:18:20 What was your trigger to select this from the ibd 50? % up or chart? @AOTtrades @amoghp88 your thoughts on $ffty which tracks the ibd 50. I'm considering it for the long term account, except for the dilution coming from 50 stocks and timing the entry aspect.
479 2018-09-25 19:17:41 Yes, I saw that too, and it doesn't help when these CEO's say overall response when the measure is objective response. What is more plausible for lack of maturity? That they haven't seen enough response, or that it hadn't reached a predetermined amount? It's the latter, I promise
480 2018-09-25 19:17:39 So does a weed stocks from $10 to $300 in a span of a few months so anything’s on the table
481 2018-09-25 19:17:13 Don’t forget ALL of the laughing-stocks accusers.
482 2018-09-25 19:16:59 #stocks $Trxc and $sens are great long term investments. Both companies are innovators. Do your due diligence.
483 2018-09-25 19:16:07 Oh, I know. Poor, poor Conservative Republicans....getting called out on all their bullshit. You're international laughing stocks.
484 2018-09-25 19:13:53 They've been pissing me off more and more lately. That ran that shitty piece against bump stocks that really hobbled our side.
485 2018-09-25 19:13:47 Yes this explains rank from 1-100 with 1 poorest etc. So 9 is not good. My fear is that small pharma stocks like this have binary outcomes with low probability of success. So this stock not for me (too risky).. having said that I know little about it. So DYOR

496 2018-09-25 19:09:59 Not as clear cut as you think. The masses think ORR is overall response rate, and it's not. It's Objective Response Rate. The company is saying data hasn't hit a predetermined amount to have fully matured for their objective response rate.

516 2018-09-25 18:59:47 @Guruleaks1 oh cmon, stop it. Honorably  persons who know how to use a stock photo will certainly know a lot about stocks. No? Sure. And on top of it, I heard they were in church each and every Sunday in the 80ties with Brett. No confirmation of Renate yet, though...
517 2018-09-25 18:59:21 So let me get this straight. Not only did #Bowsette make the internet horny, but it also got Nintendo's attention and raised their stocks? That's... Amazing.

518 2018-09-25 18:57:41 Not sure if you have looked around, but we aren't exactly in an environment where stocks are priced using reality and sound fundamental thinking.
519 2018-09-25 18:56:49 Itching to get back into some crypto. I see a few good set-ups but they’re useless with $BTC being a lil’ bitch.

530 2018-09-25 18:50:55 No my stocks never performed as well as the last 18 months, we have never had as many clients to service, and lower income clients are now calling us for service.

547 2018-09-25 18:41:48 "Stocks have outperformed bonds over every 30 year period" becomes "Stocks have outperformed bonds" and often "Stocks outperform bonds." Yet the first statement is radically different from the last. As educators, we must be conscientiousness when articulating investment facts.

555 2018-09-25 18:38:49 I use Stash, Robinhood, Fidelity, and now vanguard.  Stash is the free app (that I know of) that lets you split stocks. so if the stock is $40,  then you buy 25% of it with just $10.
556 2018-09-25 18:38:03 I know how much the stocks jumped the morning after the election, I know how much more money people are spending w my company the last 18 months vs the prior 8 years, and I know job growth has never been this hot in decades...businesses love trump, and so do consumers

852 2018-09-25 16:35:47 Diversification works wonders regardless if you are in ETFs, MFs, small stocks or big stocks. It cuts downside risk unless they are all winners.

911 2018-09-25 16:14:05 Seem to be going well now that I have reduced my number of holdings. +1.7% today & +22% since mid July. May add a few more stocks & increase position size.Couple of cheeky Buy orders will hopefully trigger soon!
912 2018-09-25 16:13:51 Rubbish day for my stocks again... grinding down across the board!

On a brighter note, I was signed off by the physio, & am allowed to start a "phased return" to sport, including my beloved squash. An October plan to shift my bulk will be commencing!
913 2018-09-25 16:12:29 Waw, seriously!!! You only see Weed stocks as simple commodity!!! No distribution no MEDICAL no Licence no Patent no Labs no comparison with alcohol and legal issues.

915 2018-09-25 16:12:06 Clearly someone's not buying the Jeevaatma 2.0 stocks.
916 2018-09-25 16:11:18 Most AIM stocks - 
917 2018-09-25 16:10:53 Pretty much all!  I am sorry but I avoid discussing individual stocks. It's hard to develop a conviction based on another person's views and also, a stock has to be considered with respect to a portfolio.
918 2018-09-25 16:10:14 Exactly. DO NOT DO EVERY SBC. you have to look at potential return. 5k for a 7.5k pack is not good you wont make return. 3k is better. U shouldn't spend more than 10k on any SBC unless it's for a player or a 50k pack. 15k max for a 50k pack SBC. It's like stocks always changing
919 2018-09-25 16:09:56 @timothysykes every time I buy stocks I can hear @timothysykes ...study study & take profits  thanks Tim, “sometimes no trade is the best trade” going to finish my book.
920 2018-09-25 16:09:08 Yeah if they know what they are doing. That’s the risk. How many people investing $75 and bragging about it know what they are doing? And crypto is all speculation. Day trading will lose you money even in more established proven markets like stocks.

923 2018-09-25 16:06:11 Honey stocks are at an all time high. Nows the time to invest.
924 2018-09-25 16:05:53 We’re literally laughing stocks. Thanks trump
925 2018-09-25 16:05:52 Companies are now flush with cash from the tax cuts and deregulation and whatever other shit the gop is doing. So they're buying back stocks to drive up the price. They're buying smaller businesses. This always ends in a crash. If you haven't yet, you should sell your stocks.

927 2018-09-25 16:05:35 And they it is market correction. In a growing economy stocks wont get corrected to their 5 year old levels. Only cunning, well orchestrated manipulation by cartels, big fat cats with inside info can do this. And they do it over & over again. To be safe, buy gold, though its idle
928 2018-09-25 16:05:31 There are some things concerning.  % of stocks above their 50 sma is diverging - may lead into a decent correction.  A lot of the bull's leaders looking suspicious as well. The longer term stuff for a major bear is not there however.
929 2018-09-25 16:04:20 The “stocks” link also has commodities and forex. Leverage up to 50x on silver
930 2018-09-25 16:04:01 Thank you for elucidating this middle path! I have struggled a bit with the reality of the theory of no not timing and also balancing risks and valuations. This year my personal rule for NEW investable funds - 50% cash, 50% stocks, so if we crash I'll have a stockpile to invest.
931 2018-09-25 16:03:48 In the #crypto trading, It's like stocks but 5 times faster because it's 24/7, small market cap and more speculative.

942 2018-09-25 16:00:19 My bank is all like: "start a savings account so you can gain 2% APY!"

952 2018-09-25 15:53:08 It didn’t feel like a good day but PF up 0.5% and ISA up 2%.  AAZ (again!) and FDEV the main movers, SOLG and IQE (why did I buy back?  Why?) the losers.  Need to have some more stocks to research: well done those who hold LTG, on my watchlist but too late!

958 2018-09-25 15:51:16 Salary and Stocks. The latter are doing terribly this year. I am also considering getting into a mortgage and stop paying a rent. Although this is less visible a stream of income, it is one too indeed.

962 2018-09-25 15:49:05 The problem was men like Schulenburg and Stauffenberg were of aristocratic stocks and they had bad experience with the socialists and the communists who kicked their parents out of power, so they were attracted to the alternatives, the nazis... @_@

975 2018-09-25 15:42:30 I’m a firm believer that trend lines are a little too basic of a technique to be relied on heavily. There’s numberous other factors that should be considered as well before making stock picks. #Trading #StockMarket #Stocks
976 2018-09-25 15:42:05 Yeah thats fucking stupid. Its just so annoying. And their stocks will be fine. They own 40 percent of the movies that come out. Everything has become so fucking pussyfied its ridiculous.
977 2018-09-25 15:41:58 Complete bullshit statement. If you go into a comic book store and can’t spend $10 you’re a cunt. Literally thousands of choices and I’ve never, ever heard of a comic shop that only stocks Marvel and DC. This clown is full of utter shit.
978 2018-09-25 15:41:26 There's always a part of the market in a bear phase of its own. 

SO not deploying cash only makes sense if u can't find stocks to buy. 

I generally have constraints on the cash side, not the ideas side 
979 2018-09-25 15:41:08 2/ that directly reflects whatever "money unit" the original index/stock is in! So it's useful for people who know the value of stocks already and for super basic measurements. It's easier for news anchors to say "points" than it is to say "dollars" or switch between currencies!

So u can't have a perfect entry. U pick up good pedigree stocks gradually. If they fail to prove themselves, i (personally) exit in 3 years. 

Low churn is my preference. Maximum 1 or 2 entry/exit per year.

Return on Equity or ROE

ROE = profit margin × asset turnover × financial leverage

ROE = (annual net profit ÷ sales) × (sales ÷ assets) × (assets ÷ shareholders’ equity)

1033 2018-09-25 15:16:05 I'm long with a tight stop loss.  September hasn't really been positive. AMZN, which I trade, fell 10%. Many stocks are down from their ATHs. It feels that market has just now started to recover, but we'll see with Thursdays news - what happens.
1034 2018-09-25 15:15:46 I am adding to existing stocks.

A HIGHLY concentrated portfolio swings a lot! 

If you can't digest that kind of volatility in returns, stick to 20 stocks. 

My personal preference is 8-12 stocks irrespective of size of portfolio. Of course, with big money u can have a long tail.

1165 2018-09-25 14:19:06 Hello Twitter, I would like a simple, reliable, easy to read stocktracker app for my Samsung phone (ie Android) that covers USA and Canada listed stocks. 

No need for realtime, would like alphabetical order, nothing fancy, just a basic info screen.

All recos gladly received.

1172 2018-09-25 14:15:55 Note - half of Americans don't own stocks, typical US home net worth still 20% lower than 2007, millions are not looking for work so not counted in unemployment data, inequality continues to grow. This is Trump's economy? Nothing to crow about.

1174 2018-09-25 14:15:24 Some smart people that think there's going to be a rush OUT of bonds and into stocks as rates spike and inflation kicks in.

I always figured a shock to stocks would do the opposite and the bond market being bigger and far more important... would be the Fed's priority.
1175 2018-09-25 14:15:06 Absolutely agreed. Risk skew is terrible if news like this can't deliver hundreds of percent. Not the first I've seen of late that has barely moved on big news, and nowhere near enough reward being seen to offset the drip on many stocks in a news lull.

1197 2018-09-25 14:05:57 So pushing a player in the back of the head while you’re on the sideline doesn’t constitute of being an idiot while on the field? I’m a Bucs fan and have seen every snap of his career. If his name was Sam Bradford NO ONE would care!
1198 2018-09-25 14:05:47 #OOTT  Remember in 2007 oil was rising quickly.  Economy in US was growing.  FOMC was raising rates from a 1% level after 9/11. Consumer confidence was rising.  Then in August 2007, three Bear Sterns Reits were liquidated due to losses.  Stocks rose.  Anything sound familiar?

1230 2018-09-25 13:53:37 I’d agree with that that. I was close to calling my post ‘Home, Stocks, Voice Memos, and News on Mac’ because it was more a critique of the fact Apple is shipping these apps in this state, less about Marzipan itself really.

1313 2018-09-25 13:24:48 Indian equities ended higher today, snapping a five-day losing streak. Buying was witnessed in banking, auto and pharma stocks while oil and gas and metal stocks were under selling pressure.

1362 2018-09-25 13:00:39 Are Stocks from Corporations a Registered Security in USA? #XRP seems like the closet thing to Stocks. Issued by Ripple Labs like stocks,  dividends ect.

1367 2018-09-25 12:59:44 Sniffy, these are the ones that would turn up for a front row seat at a public hanging or pelt somebody in the Stocks with rotten veg an fruit. Sad sad sad.
1368 2018-09-25 12:59:38 Watch redemptions as people jump from stocks to the "safety" of bonds or cash at the next market scare or downturn. Just my opinion, but that shoots more people in the foot vs fees & stats out there show that instead of buying at a discount many sell off 
1369 2018-09-25 12:57:27 With $SAEX being so strong yesterday, I'm keeping a close eye on any recent reverse split stocks that hit scanners for sympathy momo

1415 2018-09-25 12:30:10 #omi unlike other aim stocks it’s completley derisked.
This will go from strength to strength over the coming weeks and months and will rise substantially on drilling plans. Best share to be in on aim at the moment from both risk and potential sp explosion perspectives.
1416 2018-09-25 12:30:04 I see. Perhaps better to look at individual stocks then.
1417 2018-09-25 12:29:20 I think if div stocks are overvalued, it can make sense to deploy capital elsewhere.  However, if your mortgage is low interest and 15yr, might not make sense to pay it down more... decisions, decisions!
1418 2018-09-25 12:28:38 Joined in January 2018, means you missed the real action and probably bought the top. Congrats. And crypto hasn’t been hot in nearly a year.

1436 2018-09-25 12:17:15 When does the Grand Rotation from bonds into stocks take off? One trigger is when the bond coupon yield can no longer overcome the price loss.. that opens eyes..when it happens quickly in a steep path..panic usually begins and extreme actions taken. It then starts...

1442 2018-09-25 12:13:55 Stocks up 100% or more since Jan 2018 (period when all the indices have been correcting) are your future winners

Dn't get bogged down thinking they are up 100% already & now can't go up further. 2016-18 saw stocks going up 10-20x. First 1x is usually just the beginning

1463 2018-09-25 12:00:00 Thanks for stepping up to make this unpopular statement. It's so true. Sure, this balls to the wall & maverick approach to investing is "sexy".

1514 2018-09-25 11:32:37 Right but what it says is that shareholders holding widely diversified portfolios would not notice. If one firm disappears the portfolio does well on other stocks. This leads to the famous distinction between systematic risk and idiosyncratic risk.

I prefer restructuring my portfolio at lows. Most of the changes are complete. 

Couldn't sell a couple of smaller ones as there was HARDLY any liquidity. 

As portfolio grows, your basket of stocks to CHOOSE from can reduce, due to lack of liquidity.

1532 2018-09-25 11:24:39 Not accurately no. Shorting housing stocks is a proxy in the ST/MT. Just look back at what happened prior to 2007/08 and what would have protected you then.

1725 2018-09-25 08:46:25 Why are #DHFL, #YesBank and #IndiaBullls stocks hammered despite no official link with defaults or #ILFS? Either they are hiding something we do not know. Or market manipulators are cashing in on the confusion. Either way, regulators owe investors an explanation #Sensex
1726 2018-09-25 08:46:12 No.  Because of the GOP, our tax dollars are given to the 1% who in turn buy back their stocks while laying off their employees.  GOP has caused this mess.  We will fix it yet again.
1727 2018-09-25 08:46:06 Many stocks trade out of normal hours, and also outside of their home exchanges (e.g., OTC or GDR).

Also an increase in "tradeable" hours doesn't necessarily mean a net increase in liquidity, c.f. regional FX pairs.

1729 2018-09-25 08:45:22 Sometimes the news will follow the price. It's very rare that a fall of this magnitude in some stocks is an isolated mad case. It will take time to understand, unless you're a knowing insider.

1904 2018-09-25 06:30:32 Interactive Brokers, lowest brokerage, can short stocks, instant international markets, no brainer.
1905 2018-09-25 06:29:54 I object to even one pound of my money going towards benefits for him and his family. What a joke our country has become. Send him to the stocks! Pier’s should campaign to re-introduce the stocks!!!
1906 2018-09-25 06:28:16 Sensex extends weakness, Nifty below 10,950; banking stocks lead declines
1907 2018-09-25 06:28:01 Hahaha! Di pa naman nakukuha ateeee haha kunin mo na! Di ba wala ng stocks nyan?
1908 2018-09-25 06:26:53 What's the issue here if you can plz elaborate? Stocks r held in cdsl demat a/c. As investors, you don't have to trade everyday. So an Investor will be least bothered abt slow app during volatile times.
1909 2018-09-25 06:25:35 I don’t hate the stocks I own. But yes I’m not a fan of chasing stocks just because they are below cash. They get a temporary bump around 20-50% but only if you’re first to buy. It will fade after
1910 2018-09-25 06:25:20 Why that? Why not tax those that made money in the stocks? Or invented a new product? Or discovered gold on their property? Or became a successful doctor or lawyer or architectural
1911 2018-09-25 06:25:00 @Shell_India 
Has Shell Bunks stopped selling the regular un-leaded Petrol in Bangalore?
Your bunks do not hve stocks n always force the customer to buy very high priced V- Power Petrol, priced around 97 per litre!
Its a very big inconvenience.
It shuld be optional I understand?

2031 2018-09-25 04:54:54 I wonder if it would be possible for the original creator of Bowsette to copyright the character and start selling merchandise of it  If it has made Nintendo stocks jump up like that could you imagine how much he would make?

2033 2018-09-25 04:50:34 Can we all just sit and be amazed at the fact that a waifu has pretty much taken over Twitter and the internet in general... AS WELL AS bumping Nintendo's stocks up by at least 2 percent.

Also, she has a subreddit with over 14K subscribers.

Well done, Bowsette.

2035 2018-09-25 04:49:28 I really like swing #trading on a 240 min chart to enter trades that last for weeks & sometimes for months.
Even better when I can move my SL to break-even within hours of entry because of the strength of price moving in my favor.

2036 2018-09-25 04:49:06 I am guessing the outstanding amount in your trading account is stuck....Correct ? But the demat stocks should be safe as they are held in NSDL/CSDL.  Buddy, Also how did u end up with such a Broker when there lot of big name brokers available in market ?
2037 2018-09-25 04:48:53 Herd Behaviour is one the reason stocks go up very fast and fall very fast #equityinvesting
2038 2018-09-25 04:48:52 Share & Stock market not a very difficult game at all but still lot of investors fail reason they do not do their own study of stocks they R investing in but just invest on advice of others or because some 1 has made in market.Never listen 2 others Take UR own decisions Money URs
2039 2018-09-25 04:44:20 We see value in #China #stocks. @LSLPartners , we like #PPDai $PPDF as we believe concerns that borrowers are using funds to pay off other debts are unfounded. With access to borrower ecommerce platforms, #PPDai can verify use of borrowings #Chinatradewar @VertexCapital
2040 2018-09-25 04:44:18 Also was reminded that we all own stocks and can sell them or keep them once we hit our 2 year mark so hopefully in 10 months the stock is still up or rising at least cause there’s a couple people that sold theirs and got $4000 hoping I can double that

2045 2018-09-25 04:37:28 Nintendo HAS to include Bowsette in mario canon now, or at least in some game. Bowsette has gotten so much love and appreciation in such a small time span, I SAW IT AFFECTED THEIR STOCKS POSITIVELY, LIKE WHAT?!
2046 2018-09-25 04:36:15 Hi
Due to some work, i am not activ in trading today. So will not be able to share any calls.

Good luck
2047 2018-09-25 04:35:55 There was this biz group at one point of time were fav in stock mkt. Reason: Stocks were worked to swing either way so traders got benefits. It's popularity to attract subscription to public offers was based on such works. #90s
2048 2018-09-25 04:35:34 The appearance of bowsette has made Nintendo’s stocks increase more than the last Nintendo direct did. Let that sink in
2049 2018-09-25 04:35:32 @GlobalProTrader CB easing doesn't automatically equal immediate new ATHs--2000-02 and 2007-08 proved that. If earnings are falling, stocks will fall regardless of how many bonds they buy. Will need massive fiscal stimulus, and even that is risky if it spikes inflation.
2050 2018-09-25 04:35:08 Finviz is the best site I found to monitor stocks via news articles. It has it all. As far as monitoring graphs, I found a couple other good ones. I wrote them down at work so tweet me manana and I’ll send em over

2061 2018-09-25 04:26:01 They know what they are doing but I remember being very surprised when I first looked at this fund and saw how many stocks they held.. I think they had about 90 odd stocks last time I checked.
2062 2018-09-25 04:25:48 Many MORE companies.  And a lot more garbage ones.  And 18 years less technical advancement. Which is why current companies command higher ratios. They hold more promise.  Well...SOME do.  Invest in those few and skip the index funds where 80% of the stocks aren't worth owning.

2150 2018-09-25 03:34:07 I'm a worry wort about the stock market and economy. How long will the market absorb the tariff tantrum? I reduced my exposure by about 20% to stocks. I just don't have confidence in Trump's handling of tariffs.
2151 2018-09-25 03:33:38 Damn near your stocks cost more
2152 2018-09-25 03:32:28 I'm not telling anyone to short anything

"Short biased" simply means that I believe they are easier to play (in the short term) on the short side. I personally am not going to trade the cannabis stocks (locates are way too expensive)

2155 2018-09-25 03:31:37 I am not skeptical either.  I am extremely confident that we are getting close to a nice rise and in reasonably short order almost all if not all U stocks will take off.  I am confident in s232 too. I think the domestic producers will do best but that is me.

2267 2018-09-25 02:20:32 How can we stop this scenario from continuing ? When and if people becomes sensitive to others stealing from the common purse, expose them early before they emptied the funds. The retirement funds shouldn’t be in liquid cash ! Invest them in stocks outside Nigeria
2268 2018-09-25 02:20:26 And how has that effected me?  I don’t own any stocks.  Inner city school teacher.  This hasn’t even had a post effect upon the parents of my kids.  Just more working poor.

2273 2018-09-25 02:19:18 CLSA on Real Estate

    Stay positive on the sector with Godrej Properties our top pick.
    See Oberoi Realty and Prestige Estates as high value stocks.
2274 2018-09-25 02:18:46 Averaging in mutual funds is safer as it will mostly come up. I am not sure about stocks. As i am newbie here. But mutual fund nav can be averaged out during falls.
2275 2018-09-25 02:18:46 CLSA on Real Estate

    Property stocks down on higher interest rates, accounting changes and liquidity issues of lenders.
    Weak performance comes even as sales have started to pick-up.
    Visible value stocks should be easy buys.
2276 2018-09-25 02:18:42 NEVER rule out those dilution plays bother. Remember $PPCB .004 - .30 in a few days..most diluted stocks at one time were a highly priced stock..a little let off the faucet and they have huge booms and bigger short squeezes . It’s all about reading that L2 and gauging the faucet.

2287 2018-09-25 02:10:24 The issues surrounding the payment of these money is shrouded in the problems with Nigeria systems. The funds the payment are supposed to be readily available in either banks or stocks market which are non functional. Some directors swallowed it!

2289 2018-09-25 02:08:27 Of the economy will get nothing. Corporate America will just buyback stocks to grow eps. It’s already close to $1T a year in buybacks. That’s enough to give every working American $10K more per yr in income. The system is basically built for theft. /2

2294 2018-09-25 02:07:05 Louis Lowenstein - First, timing still matters, because price and value matter. In real dollars, stocks did not return to their 1966 level until 1992.
2295 2018-09-25 02:06:59 Equities climbed in Japan as traders returned from a holiday, though  Chinese shares headed in the opposite direction after a long weekend.  Australia was little changed. Hong Kong -- where stocks fell Monday on  escalating trade tensions -- and South Korea are shut Tuesday.
2296 2018-09-25 02:06:45 Asian stocks traded mixed Tuesday as investors pondered concerns about  the outlook for global trade and American politics. The dollar held  recent gains as 10-year Treasury yields consolidated above 3 percent,  and oil traded at a four-year high.
2297 2018-09-25 02:06:06 Fear of fixed income markets freezing and drying up of liquidity for NBFCs seems to be having a panic effect across automobile, FMCG, core sector companies’ stocks. Statements are no longer having calming effect. Quick action is required from RBI and SEBI to restore calm.

2316 2018-09-25 01:59:46 Knowing when to sell is the key decision now. This is getting a little bubble-ish. Growing their profits enough to grow into the stock's current P/E is a tall order. High P/E stocks getting clobbered during market corrections.

2326 2018-09-25 01:53:39 Except that banks are not people -- they do not feel pain. Shareholders can feel pain (and if bank stocks are in your pension plan, so will you). Depositors may feel pain. Q is whether those responsible for bad decisions will feel pain.
2327 2018-09-25 01:52:49 Will the US govt “allow” bear markets any longer, or has the US stock market become so crucial to supporting trillions of dollars in unfunded liabilities that the Fed will just buy stocks in the event of a crash.

2389 2018-09-25 01:13:16 How do we deal with huge deficits and entitlements?  How can one find reasonable risk adjusted returns and from what asset class.  Stocks at record price to sales.  Bond yields low.  Complacency high.

2402 2018-09-25 01:00:04 Blood is not on the street yet. Many are tempted to buy stocks that were not able to buy earlier. It will be only when everybody is shit scared to buy anything.
2403 2018-09-25 00:57:52 $MU $LRCX $KLAC $AEIS On Semis I want to make this clear, there are few upside catalysts for these stocks until early next year when the visibility is better.

2436 2018-09-25 00:32:49 The last crisis was a manifestation of shaky margining arrangements and obscene amounts of leverage. 

The next crisis will be too much cash chasing higher interest rates out the door. 

I predict a 70s like era for stocks, but maybe sideways-to-higher. 1968 analog.

2440 2018-09-25 00:30:10 ...I have a problem with growth-stock investing. Companies tend not to grow at high rates forever. Businesses change... Markets mature. Competition can increase. Good managements can retire... the market is littered with once highly profitable growth stocks... -- Ed Wachenheim
2441 2018-09-25 00:29:32 I think you probably follow resources more than I do. But at this point it's hard to imagine the stocks dropping much more than 10% from these levels. Like...it can always get worse, but it's still kinda hard to imagine it getting that much worse.
2442 2018-09-25 00:24:48 Consumers are about as comfortable as they’ve been at any time in 30 years according to Bloomberg. Other periods of exceptionally high comfort led to trouble in stocks, but years later, while gold did well.

2450 2018-09-25 00:18:46 I’m hearing people saying now that the Fed had moved too quickly on the rate hike, impeding growth. Few months ago, everyone agreed that the Fed was still behind the curve. People would say anything thats justifiable nowadays. #FederalReserve #ratehike #stocks #behindthecurve
2451 2018-09-25 00:18:37 2 of the 3 stocks my dad told me to get were #1 and #9 most profitable stocks on th market today lmfao 
2452 2018-09-25 00:16:40 Tried selling stocks today through one of the more cutting edge platforms. Initiated my sell around lunch time and it's still not "settled" officially. This is why I don't play with the stock market at all anymore. Cryptocurrency converted and never looking back.

2454 2018-09-25 00:15:24 Yep. We shall see. I was surprised that it held up well after $KORS dropped nearly 8% when they announced their $2 Billion bid for Versace. $ANF was one of the better retail stocks today too.

2467 2018-09-25 00:01:33 And in theory there are regulations for protection of phone/CC and stocks.  And contracts - no one cares about them if both parties are OK with what happened.  Contracts, smart or otherwise, become an issue when the side(s) are not OK with events and want to invoke a 3rd party.
2468 2018-09-25 00:01:06 Check out Nike’s stocks and let me know if people are supporting Kaep, bub. Btw, love that they switched to college to show the nfl who’s boss. I’ve always managed to watch both because they’re on different days of the week.
2469 2018-09-25 00:00:08 This is fascinating. Well done. Definitely has value sensibilities due to the rebalancing to underperforming stocks. Do you think EW index funds should be all the large cap exposure one could need or a combination with MCW? Or is the combo counterproductive?
2470 2018-09-25 00:00:02 You're referring to govt doing things that the private sector might not do on its own. All outstanding stocks are owned by someone at all times. Having the govt buy some portion of those stocks doesn't mean there's more aggregate profits to be earned....
