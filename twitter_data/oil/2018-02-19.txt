43 2018-02-19 23:57:37 May I say this b/c I know you are a man of integrity?  I was nuts w/ what was going on.  So upset. Who did it hurt? Me. I took a few days off and prayed.  I am trusting in the only person who never lied to me, never hurt me.  My Heavenly Father will take care of this.
44 2018-02-19 23:57:20 Just out of curiosity, what ever happened to the frontman from Midnight Oil? I heard he got elected to some position and shit the bed.
45 2018-02-19 23:56:53 Electric vehicles are getting better and better and a wind farm in NYC would be ideal. Would that settlement be enough to start a wind or solar site and reduce oil use

50 2018-02-19 23:56:03 Diestro, Gees & somehow w the opposition he faces America is moving in the right diection. You forget we are now an energy exporter & Putin can't use his oil against Europe. Russia has no money & suffers bc they can't sell their oil. It's working better than the BHO sanctions

53 2018-02-19 23:55:26 It's pretty easy. Cut the potatoes super thin, rinse in very cold water repeatedly until the water is clear, then soak in ice water with salt and garlic for 30 minutes. Press the water out and then deep fry at 365 for 4 or 5 minutes a batch. Blot out the oil and salt

66 2018-02-19 23:53:31 I kinda tilted more towards water being the new oil
67 2018-02-19 23:53:29 yup tht brand is like exactly for tht type of woman tho thts why i love it. i can wear my bb cream put castor oil on my lids for gloss use the lipgloss for highlght and im set ( vegan /veggie based as well ) 

darker shade foundation beef is like so irritating lol
68 2018-02-19 23:53:26 I'm not sure how to decipher what you said. Seems like gibberish to me. Why dont you try letting the market naturally replace oil as oil replaced coal and whale oil; naturally over time instead of forcing others to bow to your opinion. That's all you have an uneducated opinion.
69 2018-02-19 23:53:22 I love the smell of tea tree oil

78 2018-02-19 23:52:11 But that might infringe on a company putting a nuclear power plant or a coal fired plant there.  A oil pipeline from the offshore wells and maybe a wall down the middle with poor people on one side. SO many ways to look at the same picture.

86 2018-02-19 23:50:55 I don’t agree that Rachel Notley has sold out. The reality is it would take billions to build a refinery and probably 10 years. By then, oil use will have plunged and the refinery would be as much of a dino as oil itself. Nah...let’s just play russian roulette with the ecosystem

92 2018-02-19 23:50:22 Gotcha! I tried the Curl N Styling Cocktail which was ok but nothing like my beloved olive oil. Really trying to use black castor oil to help with this damn postpartum shed so definitely tell me what you think!

94 2018-02-19 23:50:08 My truck is all good pretty much. Oil change is done, the check engine light has to do with an air system injection issue so nothing crazy at all, and she’s topped off with fresh coolant  small water pump leak but not crazy bad either

96 2018-02-19 23:49:31 But if I eat both fish *and* fish oil will my hair be too strong and glossy? My skin too flawless? My nails capable of shattering glass?
Will I have aqua-dynamic hair capable of lassos and braille? Will the dewy glow of my skin cure blindness? Will I be recruited by the Avengers?
97 2018-02-19 23:49:24 After careful thought about this situation, I'd have questions. 

Clearly, the friend was going through some emotional stuff. If he hadn't had a firearm close at hand, perhaps he wouldn't have taken his life. 

That's a tough thought to live with, as his friend.

105 2018-02-19 23:47:55 Yes & I'm sure Russia is really enjoying the implementation of President Trump's America First energy policy that's keeping oil & gas prices down which is really, really bad for the Russian economy

117 2018-02-19 23:46:23 How embarrassing to find the 'leader of the free world' guilty of illegally invading a country to simply enact regime change and oil rights.
118 2018-02-19 23:46:06 Fabulous news!  I knew I liked that rascal Harry, but he’s earned my respect as well!  Donald can just order another cheeseburger and mull over ways to seek revenge, maybe cut off health care access for seniors or place an oil drilling rig in the middle of Lake Tahoe.
119 2018-02-19 23:46:02 What? Comparing Bartman and these morons is simplistic. I was at Wrigley that night and had no interest in who he was. This situation is different - identify them. Do you want them changing your oil? Cashing your check? Working for you? Teaching your kid? I thought not.
120 2018-02-19 23:45:57 @Russ_Warrior @ValdaiClub   Agreed, #RU is diversifying its GDP, becoming more self sufficient, no longer dependent on oil
121 2018-02-19 23:45:25 Russia has $500b in Artic oil alone. Exxon, Trump, Tillerson will get BILLIONS fr Putin on that one field. Drpp sanctions & keep demand up.
122 2018-02-19 23:45:20 Oil and gas companies already have the right to drill on private land. Mineral rights have trumped land rights for decades.

125 2018-02-19 23:44:55 Which essential oil cures depression?
126 2018-02-19 23:44:55 Yes, and we also used whale oil for light. We are neither a colony struggling for independence, nor a pre-electrical nation anymore. Your point actually helps the gun ban argument by pointing to a legitimate use that expired more than two centuries ago.

150 2018-02-19 23:41:07 @JonRJonsson Hello Dear,

My names are Augustine William. I am contacting you in respect of my late client, an Oil and Gas Contractor who seemed to be your relative. He left behind US$58 Million  in a bank here before his death. and the deal will be shared rate 50/50 % and it's
151 2018-02-19 23:41:05 Matty boyz oil boyz it’s all the same 
152 2018-02-19 23:40:55 Obama kush always made me laugh  
I need to get an oil/wax vape pen too. 
I want to be done with smoking, in general. 
Gonna look this pico up, thanks 
153 2018-02-19 23:40:51 This is presumably what @GrahamJones_MP has been itching for, in his many accusations against Maduro’s govt, another country with huge oil reserves being targeted by the US
154 2018-02-19 23:40:50 Oil, mining, fish, tourism, technology, and engineering - these are the sectors that @harriscentre think best represent the future of NL economy. Do you think they missed any? #nlpoli
155 2018-02-19 23:40:45 It's even more criminal not to give this child the cannabis oil that is already proven to help him live a life. I would not hesitate xxx

163 2018-02-19 23:40:00 A large number of our mining companies are foreign-owned. Same with oil. Shell and BP are British.
164 2018-02-19 23:39:52 The way @Laura88Lee pronounces oil and greasy makes my day. #ole #greazy

167 2018-02-19 23:39:42 Venezula? Made a bad call to retain its national interest in oil above other resources which have been systematically plundered by US corporations in common with many South American countries, aided by bought and paid for right wing factions.
168 2018-02-19 23:39:36 Probably be burning the midnight oil on cars again this year

170 2018-02-19 23:39:28 There has to be a way for everyone. No matter how educated you are on the subject or how much you know about oil, to have an understanding of what went down. That's what this book does. For anyone that needs that reminder read the intro. In it I say that my goal ...

173 2018-02-19 23:39:18 I've been using oil for a few years but it's just so unpredictable (I take it mostly for cancer induced insomnia) - amount/timing/how much Ive eaten, etc.
174 2018-02-19 23:39:13 Yamapi said oil massage is popular among girls. He doesn't really like it but likes Shiatsu massage more. After oil massage his body feels kind of sticky and he also gets really sleepy after it. #sound_tripper
175 2018-02-19 23:39:13 Washed my car post-oil-change. Vacuumed, buffed, cleaned headlight covers. I still need to wipe it down inside (dusty!) but otherwise she is looking PRETTY PRETTY PRETTY GOOD.
176 2018-02-19 23:38:37 Are you hoping for another job with the GOP?  Otherwise just stop selling what most of us know to be snake oil.

181 2018-02-19 23:37:34 You forget that people outside your circle of people in the oil industry want to learn and understand what happened. And in order to do that. You have to storytell. I used the cars as an example because it was a strong example.
182 2018-02-19 23:37:33 Olive oil! If you rub some on your hands and leave it on for like 15 mins it should help.
183 2018-02-19 23:37:13 Fish Oil cured my depression
184 2018-02-19 23:37:04 ubos na chilli oil ko..di naman ako pwede bumili kasi ibang chilli oil yun..nag iisa lang yung gawa ng tito..ubos na din daw chilli oil nya, baka daw next month pa makagawa ulit..
185 2018-02-19 23:36:59 I wonder how much of this has to do with clearing the Arctic for oil drilling. Which company are they trying to give the rights to? #FollowTheMoney

187 2018-02-19 23:36:48 Why must he be forced by law to do what he thinks is right?
188 2018-02-19 23:36:19 Dude. You're compensating with a Dodge RAM that has an engine that sounds (and smells) like an airplane engine. Don't leave your engine running while you run into the gas station for your chewing tobacco.

Or better yet--change the freakin' oil in your truck.
189 2018-02-19 23:36:12 Second of all. I can't print all the documents (thousands) I received and studied for years. A because I can't legally.  B.  Because that would be a boring book. And C. who besides you and maybe a few other oil people would read that.

From the Tweet: This weekend, he destroyed his gun “to make sure this weapon will be ever be able to take a life."
199 2018-02-19 23:35:01 Today's word from A to Z corner was 'Oil'. Yamapi thinks eating oil is important but can be bad if it's consumed too much. He also said when he makes or eats spaghetti and feels as if something is missing in it's taste, he adds olive oil and it becomes tasty #sound_tripper

201 2018-02-19 23:34:52 They got what they wanted. A semi-literate, bullying, snake oil salesman. The kind of guy they do business with at the buy here, pay here lot.
202 2018-02-19 23:34:48 & oil companies & the military-industrial complex & Wall Street &....
203 2018-02-19 23:34:46 And now getting my oil changed. Now I wander Wal-Mart for an hour.
204 2018-02-19 23:34:44 Moral of the story: GET UR OIL CHANGED BEFORE YOU GET KRAFT MAC N CHEESE!!!
205 2018-02-19 23:34:25 Aww, thank you  The skin cream smells very strongly of tea tree oil and lavender, which is supposed to put him off licking it, but he licks it anyway and then has to drink lots of water. He's a silly doggy 
206 2018-02-19 23:34:19 And she's wrong on drilling, killing hibernating bears & selling out her state for oil , voting for #GOPTaxScam & refusing to censure -45 for refusing to implement last year's #RussianSanctions Gonna need more space! She played a game to win her seat.
207 2018-02-19 23:34:12 I am choosing to wait.  To take a Selah, before saying more.  I was just thinking you might want to hear another perspective. 
Not trying to convert. Honestly.
208 2018-02-19 23:34:06 Corvallis...Jon I need a reference for a good mechanic...in particular someone to put in a new oil pan.
209 2018-02-19 23:33:59 We don't need oil and gas as much as we used to. We have the technology to use solar and wind. Oil, gas and coal are going the way of the dodo bird!
210 2018-02-19 23:33:56 For the first time ever I Changed my cars oil all by myself today! 
211 2018-02-19 23:33:56 hey @ my international buds who r legal age: pleas consider  buying BC wine 2 support us in fighting alberta over this dipshit oil pipeline plan
212 2018-02-19 23:33:55 In it you say KRG oil was exported to refineries in Ceyhan. There are no refineries in Ceyhan.
213 2018-02-19 23:33:26 Ah i see i havent used oil to blend out graphite before but this makes me want to try it out soon. Keep it up though this came out really clean!
214 2018-02-19 23:33:09 These people are animals and .@POTUS needs to disengage from them if he's truly "draining the swamp" and "working on US infrastructure" -- for the self-respect of Americans if nothing else FFS -- so what does SA produce besides oil that we can #Boycott?
215 2018-02-19 23:32:33 You sir have a nice view being by the river. Didn't wonder much farther south of town when was over there.  Lots of nice paved oil roads too, made driving nice.
216 2018-02-19 23:32:27 I love that they are all holding a bottle of canola oil.  Thanks to my @Richardsons agronomist for bringing that gift to the farm.
217 2018-02-19 23:32:23 There's a new jackbox party pack out. Can highly recommend Secret Hitler and red flags

222 2018-02-19 23:31:56 my bio professor said “Just remember, oil is kinky”
He was referring to the kinks in the bonds on the carbon chains of a phospholipid
223 2018-02-19 23:31:50 Sir the area is vysya bank colony 5th a main. Behind indian oil petrol bunk. Do you really need a complaint?
224 2018-02-19 23:31:45 Also an oil change and inspection. Maybe just maybe watch some tv and relax 
225 2018-02-19 23:31:32 So we should sell our oil companies to Saudi Arabia by your rationale?
226 2018-02-19 23:31:31 Yeah you basically have to take everything apart to replace something, change the oil, etc. thankfully I would be under warranty for a while. Yeahhh also aware that it’s more expensive fixing stuff. VW is just the dream for me haha. I’ve always wanted one.

229 2018-02-19 23:30:54 @Earth_Balance Are you planning on making the vegan butter without palm oil as it impacts the rain forests and animals negatively? There must be a way to mass produce and retain the great flavor without the oil. I love your butter. #veganfood #veganmom #oilfree
230 2018-02-19 23:30:46 OIL DIFF: 3.15 -> 3.29
231 2018-02-19 23:30:45 Need to check if I can with the meds I take. Do you take it like cod liver oil or cook with It?
232 2018-02-19 23:30:37 No, but I’ll tell you what I WILL do: Inform my fellow Canadians that renewables provide more jobs than do all of coal, oil, gas industries combined.
233 2018-02-19 23:30:36 If the economy were overheating, we’d see gas prices and oil prices soar. We’d see prices of other commodities increase dramatically. No, what will happen is a catch-up for 8 years of mediocrity.

235 2018-02-19 23:30:27 I went on Roaccutane at the age of 34, it was tough going for 6 months but totally worth doing. It basically dries your body up, stops oil production so i suffered with very dry lips all the time, eczema on various parts on the body and monthly trips to the hospital for it. x
236 2018-02-19 23:30:09 the sun rises like oil from the waves.

237 2018-02-19 23:29:48 She's attention seeking, sure........but did she enter her second olympics with the sole purpose to oil up and walk shirtless again for THAT KIND OF attention. No, and thats far more pathetic and separate from athletics than anything shes done.

241 2018-02-19 23:29:24 I hear you. I wanted to use a Mobil 1 extended oil filter but Kia said I had to use a Kia oil filter or it could void the warranty if something happened to the engine. I doubt the Kia filter is better than the Mobil 1 filter but I use the Kia filter so I don’t void the warranty.

243 2018-02-19 23:29:13 Tbh I think if you grew up where I was from and a minority their surprised your not married off with a five a side teams before 20, or working in oil or doing HR.
244 2018-02-19 23:29:05 Y después los acusó de contrabandistas de gas oil.
245 2018-02-19 23:28:59 USD is not linked to gold. Manipulating the gold price would not affect its international value. And what do you think using oil as the swing commodity to manipulate the gold price would do to Chinese industry? Oil has a real use.

247 2018-02-19 23:28:26 Local Aussie product "Bug-grrr Off" uses 30%+ Oil of Lemon Eucalyptus, which Consumer Reports says is effective at repelling mosquitoes for 7 hours. It's a strong smell, but much nicer than your usual repellents. Yoga-ing on the balcony sounds too lovely to give up!
248 2018-02-19 23:28:25 It only takes a piece of grit to scupper the most sophisticated machine: but I'm not sure that 'regulatory alignment' is the piece of grit here. (In fact, surely it's oil that keeps the Good Friday machine going.)
249 2018-02-19 23:28:23 "The industry says that Canadian tar sands oil is very similar to  conventional heavy crudes from places such as Venezuela, Mexico and  Bakersfield, California."
250 2018-02-19 23:28:17 Hahahaha decline in oil consumption? Global consumption is still around record highs. Most production in Alberta is also quite profitable, BUT there's no way to get it to the market. If they don't resolve this soon they should go North or East and cut BC out.
251 2018-02-19 23:28:08 El Presidente también acusó de contrabandistas de gas oil. Si le consta que se implementen los controles pertinentes en las fronteras, pero bajar al nivel de patotero es una falta de respeto a lo que él representa. Pero bueno... ese es el Presidente que eligió la mayoría...
252 2018-02-19 23:27:46 I know the only fake supporters we'll have tomorrow are Madrid fans. The rest of y'all can jump into hot pipping oil.
253 2018-02-19 23:27:30 yet no one is talking about the weapons sent to the Ukraine, or the troops sent to the border, or  that the EU is concerned new sanctions.  Unlike NOKO, Russia's main export is oil and sanctions have already hurt the EU in the neighborhood of 100bn.  He understands economics
254 2018-02-19 23:27:28 How about less reliance on oil period??
255 2018-02-19 23:27:27 So happy for my pal Troy from the Vogues, his beloved Wigan Athletic just stuffed oil rich Manchester City 1-0 in the FA Cup, I guess the Beatle copy cat’s Oasis won’t be happy

258 2018-02-19 23:27:13 They keep working because the annual dividend isn't enough for a living without supplementing it with earned income. The highest payout at height of the $OIL boom was $3,269.00/year in 2008. This is a faulty argument that a more generous #basicincome will not reduce employment.

266 2018-02-19 23:25:49 He did asshole. Congress wouldn't do it so he did an EO kicking out suspected spies, confiscated properties and imposed sanctions that prevent your buddy from working with Exxon to get his oil trapped in the frozen tundra. When are YOU going to impose sanctions Congress passed???
267 2018-02-19 23:25:31 Who cares! We don’t want increased traffic of oil tankers on our coast and pipes being installed around B.C. and it’s not like that creates jobs in B.C. and also hurts our tourism industry.  There is no scientific argument needed for this.
268 2018-02-19 23:25:28 and don't forget free electric for municipalities--it really helps to keep the crime rate down, when soccer fields have their lights on, 24 hours a day; how's the 21 cents deal gonna work if oil shoots over a hundred a barrel???

276 2018-02-19 23:23:53 My main concern is finding the specified oil with the least amount of chance of voiding my warranty. I've used Quaker state' kendell, mobil, royal purple, amsoil, valvoline etc... Consistant oil changes have been gold for me. But I go with minimum manufacturer recommended.
277 2018-02-19 23:23:42 I have a blister, on my wrist. Result of a hot oil splatter. I am afraid to pop or drain it, but it is really bugging me too.

406 2018-02-19 23:07:23 It's amazing to see that oil prices took support at 27 which are apparently avg prices of 1985 and 2000 also, however and whenever it breaks 27 , we have support near 17 @1995 , which would be lower then  a bottle of mineral water in India :) upside capped at 77 @2010

414 2018-02-19 23:06:26 They said he always had THE BEST anointing oil.


415 2018-02-19 23:06:21 OIL BRENT US$65.5/bbl +1.1%. Zarubezhneft and Iran's IDRO sign MoU for Susangerd study near Ahwaz. Potential US$900m, 30kbpd development.
416 2018-02-19 23:06:21 Yep, nuoc mam sauce, sesame oil, oil, all in a wok with garlic and peppermint. Make it cook a bit and add the cockroach that you had previously slivered
417 2018-02-19 23:06:08 Trumps infrastructure plans involve running pipelines across national parks for his new gas and oil drilling. He want Zinke, to be able to allow this without congressional approval.

422 2018-02-19 23:05:17 I love this comment I hear from people. It's as though corruption doesn't matter. Fall in oil prices. Sure! Mention that in an entire chapter. But people always seem to spew that as an example of where all the money went. Doesn't take into consideration system of corruption

434 2018-02-19 23:04:00 Why do you think the US environmentalists groups are paying millions of dollar to stop this Canadian oil to hit the market. Our Canadian resources have to go global. And more importantly Canada has to use our own products. Where are the protests to Stop oil tanker imports to Can?

You could argue that in essence the dollar is oil backed, and as the dollar is the world's reserve currency, so all other fiat currencies are oil-backed.

But that's not the same as the gold standard was.

470 2018-02-19 23:00:34 The oil companies are selling their oil for a huge discount to the US. Then the US turns around and sells it abroad for a huge profit. If these companies sold it through the KM pipeline abroad, then they could expand and create even more jobs with the money they make

537 2018-02-19 22:50:27 You hit the nail right on the head. It's much the same on my side if the Pond. Morgan Stanley, owner of Chase Bank, has also invested in the destruction of Native American land by funding oil pipelines. I divested from that bank quite a while ago.

My last oil change I switched to the Mobil 1 5W 30 and the engine noise or rattle stopped. I’ve been using Mobil 1 in all my vehicles for 25yrs.

While you're doing that, look at where the Koch brothers - who famously fund the GOP - got all their money from. (Clue: a Nazi oil refinery.)

560 2018-02-19 22:47:30 By stopping a pipeline, you do nothing but increase more imports from places with less environmental policies-which means its worse for our environment.
What good is stopping the pipeline when the demand for oil is still being met?
561 2018-02-19 22:47:25 I didn’t know that!! I don’t work there lol! I didn’t think they’d do oil changes for public

570 2018-02-19 22:46:35 Victoria should not be held up as a idol of coastal good until they have finished their water treatment plant and stop polluting the ocean. Along the same line anything can be improved and we should ensure oil products are moved safely and responsible instead of just saying no.

572 2018-02-19 22:45:53 @arco sad to see we are being gouged again oil prices really low but our fuel prices are up. When oil prices go up you are quick to raise  price but not when oil prices fall the next day. Oil has crashed but no change. Do the rite thing!

A) Poor people paying more money for birdmincers?
B) business who pay massively for higher energy costs?
C) Oil companies who rake in huge profits when prices rises.

You're a gullible fool - go do some reading.

588 2018-02-19 22:43:16 The only true measure of an energy storage mechanism is well to wheel round trip efficiency. From oil well to motion and everything in-between. Ice is about 30%, hydrogen around 40% and battery EV over 80%

600 2018-02-19 22:41:25 Is this the best solution? The demand for energy stays the same does it not? As our population continues to grow, so does our need for energy. So, where will we get our energy from? Increase the number of oil tankers coming across the ocean from places like Saudi Arabia?

613 2018-02-19 22:39:29 The Federal Government is looking to raise tax on gasoline to $.43.25 cents per gallon.

667 2018-02-19 22:32:24 Consensus seems to be gravitating towards, US shale growth below 1.4 mb/d, so thats priced in. Whats not priced in is, US shale @ 2m b/d y/y growth. Oil demand growth a tad lower than the optimistic assumptions going around currently.
668 2018-02-19 22:32:11 Without the oil money this would just have been a league game

672 2018-02-19 22:31:38 Take vitamin d and zinc aswell as fish oil and do some heavy lifting, in a week you will feel more confident
673 2018-02-19 22:31:26 Unfortunately, Crisp White Cotton is not available as a Glade PlugIn Scented Oil.
674 2018-02-19 22:31:22 We have an oil change bay...
675 2018-02-19 22:31:19 We all should. Cause regardless of who is giving it to them, as a venezuelan, that's MY oil and I dont want it in Haiti. Let them go dark and without power! Ohh not to mention the food and medicine we lack, but we send their way 
676 2018-02-19 22:31:16 Despite Sachedina protestations of economic grandeur, the whole snub is blatant. Meeting with underlings indicator of gross mismanagement of JT staff. If any Indian economic motive, it's energy need! And just look at our pipeline disaster, oil AND gas. We are really stupid.
677 2018-02-19 22:31:15 sin respuestas? primero hay rebajas gas oil y contribucion, segundo es un movimiento politico.
678 2018-02-19 22:31:15 white people in my house talking about how they dip apples in coconut oil & eat it .. please evacuate
679 2018-02-19 22:31:06 It would probably be easier for them to turn of the oil taps to BC. They are just being nice. For now. #bcpoli #ableg #cdnpoli
680 2018-02-19 22:31:02 ordered from nuxe bc their oil is the best thing in the world and i get 3 free gifts with my purchase??? what a good day
681 2018-02-19 22:31:01 OIL DIFF: 3.12 -> 3.12
682 2018-02-19 22:31:01 When it comes to trade, the US competes against Mexico and China, competes against Japan and Korea over cars, against OPEC nations over oil. How come we never fret nationally over competing with European nations?
683 2018-02-19 22:31:00 yeah, mines deffo not perfect but it cleared up a lot esp the redness and oil production! i cant believe i let myself drink like 8 glasses of milk a day, how gross
684 2018-02-19 22:30:33 Demanding better security is an Immediant step none of them have talked about. Choosing the most difficult path to meaningful result IMO
685 2018-02-19 22:30:13 OIL DIFF: 3.09 -> 3.13
686 2018-02-19 22:30:10 Man city fans need to know that this is Footy not oil Money.
687 2018-02-19 22:29:55 I love his illustrations, but his oil landscapes are spectacular.  He had a very unique method of painting, which made his paintings appear very luminous.
688 2018-02-19 22:29:48 Those property owners should receive the proceeds of oil or gas on their land!
689 2018-02-19 22:29:44 The world is infatuated with trying to fix broken things and each of their attempts to repair is merely "snake oil" and ultimately a false gospel.  Eccl. 7
690 2018-02-19 22:29:38 I tried to schedule an oil change for today but it was booked already. Apparently I was too slow on the take there. BOO.

694 2018-02-19 22:29:08 Alberta oil benefits all of Canada. Don't be ignorant.
695 2018-02-19 22:29:04 When your gym, eyebrow lady, oil change, and car wash are all on the same street in a 2 mile radius 
696 2018-02-19 22:29:04 Refugees & economic migrants are two different things. The latter is illegal & media should stop putting them in the same box. It does a disservice to actual refugees who flee prosecution. 
I'm sure 200k+ unemployed Alberta oil&gas workers would love to just show up in Texas...
697 2018-02-19 22:28:59 Well crude oil is up today. So...
698 2018-02-19 22:28:56 One trip I dipped all of the quarters I was taking down in patchouli oil to act as an air freshener on the way down.

702 2018-02-19 22:28:38 Bring the old McDonald fries back tho!!! The ones with the unhealthy cooking oil haha
703 2018-02-19 22:28:24 They said they needed BTC as payment method for a medical machine. Nothing to do with any cannabis oil or anything else. I followed the financial laws and they got pissed. This is entrapment and they actually failed horribly at it.
704 2018-02-19 22:28:15 Funny how the Energy East opponents were happy to ignore all that tanker traffic. The oil is going to flow. The question is from where and how? Arguing against our product while ignoring competing sources is disingenuous and anti-Canadian.
705 2018-02-19 22:28:00 Oil tycoon 
706 2018-02-19 22:27:53 Of course! All of the caribbean micro-nations  (the "throw me somethings" I call them) still say "how high" for a freaking oil barrel. Over here it's food bags, for them it's oil shipments. Bastards

710 2018-02-19 22:27:35 CBD oil from hemp is great for anxiety. Take a few weeks to kick in, but it works for me as does a diet high in fish oil & few processed foods.
711 2018-02-19 22:27:35 It’s the palm oil
712 2018-02-19 22:27:34 Andrew doesn't understand that the price of oil is what caused co2 to go down in Alberta if it even did since I see no documentation.

718 2018-02-19 22:27:08 Remember..Etihad is only warm from the oil money burning.

722 2018-02-19 22:27:02 Yes. Au was "commodified" via paper derivatives. Au's not, after all, a genuine commodity, at least as I define commodities: raw materials, (i.e. lumber, cotton, oil, wheat, meat, etc.) that are economically essential to day to day life.
723 2018-02-19 22:26:52 Then why eas Putin willing to back Trump and keep Trump’s secrets in order to get those sabctions lifted? Money in Putin’s pockets. Oil money. Thats why.

730 2018-02-19 22:26:06 That's the BBC for you! If it was Fergie, Jose, Wenger, they'd have shown it, then slaughtered them; they never do that to money bags oil funded city!
731 2018-02-19 22:26:05 Cityzens were talking mad cash now acting like they're just a humble little club that doesn't have a billionaire oil owner. Lol.
732 2018-02-19 22:25:42 Expect Chequebook Charlie Guardiola to be begging for more dirty oil money to buy more players after the ungracious defeat to Wigan.

750 2018-02-19 22:24:08 I’m not bothered about United having a better chance of winning the FA Cup now, I’m just delighted that Arab oil money hasn’t bought the quadruple or treble this season. It wouldve been a disaster for football if City/Arabs/Oil/£££ had bought all the  trophies in one season.
751 2018-02-19 22:24:06 Same with your butt, where there gas theres oil
752 2018-02-19 22:24:06 I am 100% sure your car needs an oil change

762 2018-02-19 22:23:42 Saudi FX reserves have been rising..100% correct..however this is due to two things 1. rising oil price 2. (the shady area) the recent crackdown on royals and repatriation of their wealth ..so its is a little bit of a grey area
763 2018-02-19 22:23:37 @Cornerstone_HQ do you have any other handle options? Love the blades but with pre-shave oil, chrome handle (looks great!) is bit slippery. Can you help?
764 2018-02-19 22:23:28 i wasn’t looking while grabbing at similar looking bottles in the bathroom and i picked up my honey argan oil instead of my body spray and that was almost a disaster

770 2018-02-19 22:22:29 Maybe Frank McKenna can tell the Irving family to ask to repeal naftas proportionality clause since he's in their family paper all the time so we aren't forced to export oil but you forgot to mention that

772 2018-02-19 22:22:21 Don't know what all the fuss is about, it's simply a small club losing to an even smaller club, thing is and @ManCity fans should never forget it, Oil money can buy you all the players in the world, but it won't make everyone see you as a big club, It's that simple!

Anyone saying this crisis is just due to the oil price is stupid or deceitful and most likely both.

814 2018-02-19 22:17:23 DRILL AN OIL WELL  WHO DO THESE PEOPLE THINK THEY ARE TO DRILL THE PRESIDENT? WHY DID THEY NEVER DRILL OBAMA? GET OFF TRUMPS BACK AND DO YOUR DAMN JOB THAT IS TO DO NEWS NOT  BECOME THE NEWS LIKE YOU ARE WANTING TO YOU ARE NOT BIAS YOU ARE DEMOCRAT WHICH TO ME IS A PAIN IN THE ,,

820 2018-02-19 22:16:23 No, but you have to have the spare money to buy a bottle of oil/bag of sugar/flour etc  to have it in stock. If you have £10-15 a week for food there is never spare pennies to do this.
821 2018-02-19 22:16:22 Haha. Take your oil
822 2018-02-19 22:16:16 Masalahnya kalo liat channel dia, semua masakan dia pasti disiram sama olive oil. Jangan2 gado2 kita juga dibuat pake olive oil.

828 2018-02-19 22:15:46 I sold bitcoin for cash to a undercover DHS agent and they said they were going to purchase a medical extraction machine. This is what they purchased BTC for, not cannabis oil. So this DHS agent kidnapped me in a room for 3 hrs, told me to deanonymous all trades, I refused.
829 2018-02-19 22:15:30 Went to Fatburger for a pre game milkshake before the Oil Kings game, and they had Reese milkshakes there....that has now been added to my Milkshake Mt. Rushmore

833 2018-02-19 22:14:57 How about washing your hair in the cooking oil?
834 2018-02-19 22:14:45 Yeah, you can all be saying Obama was great on President's Day, but don't forget he expanded Bush's wars and security state, let Wall St. walk, quietly expanded oil drilling, said NOT A FUCKING WORD about #NoDAPL, and deported more peeps than any other Pres.

Howeva, I don't think Indo, regardless of what they say, is that make of a world economy it would move prices that much, especially when crude oil is still the largest energy source by a long way.
877 2018-02-19 22:10:30 Today i cooked all my food for the week, cleaned my kitchen, payed my bills, got an oil change, replaced my headlight bulbs, vacuumed, did my laundry and replaced my nuvaring. I’m one productive bitch today.

882 2018-02-19 22:10:05 United’s best team - Mancunians and local lads in the team. City’s best team - the best players shipped in with oil money. The difference

901 2018-02-19 22:07:58 Oil money couldn’t save them 
902 2018-02-19 22:07:37 Erode one of the first ten and the rest are soon to follow. Great care must be exercised and emotion should play no part.
903 2018-02-19 22:07:28 I a fair bit better then districts digging themselves into neighboring districts and mushrooming out like an oil spill, or forming little islands apart from the main body.

The old one was obvious as hell that someone was cherry-picking.
904 2018-02-19 22:07:27 Nope.  IMO gold wont be main reserve either.  Once oil/commodities are priced/settled in multiple currencies, need for reserve assets (read: UST's) falls dramatically globally (China imports ~$1T/yr in commodities for example.)  As that happens, US gov't has an acute BoP problem
905 2018-02-19 22:07:23 Things I need to do today:
*Clean car
*Get oil change
*Buy paint
*Buy new blanket for dog
*Paint

Please encourage me today friends. Make sure I get it done TODAY!
906 2018-02-19 22:07:20 Bullshit. I didn't mention olive oil because I assumed you knew to do that. That was my only mistake. I tole you to trim cap to Quarter inch. It looks like kojak now.
907 2018-02-19 22:07:03 Unlimited oil money and they still get knocked out the FA Cup by Wigan AGAIN 
908 2018-02-19 22:07:01 They'll be getting beat off Div 3 teams every week if it wasn't for oil money
909 2018-02-19 22:06:56 Well, just open your own business.  That is, I don’t know, baby oil brand marketing or something.
910 2018-02-19 22:06:52 For my face, steaming, oil cleansing, an ointment (epederm/hydromol) and Shea butter, every day. Still working on it but it’s much better.

I also changed my diet when I was trying to get rid of it. Increase your fatty acids.
911 2018-02-19 22:06:50 lol, those 23&Me, Ancestry, Who Am I dna testing kits are snake oil. Look in the mirror to see who u r.

Fans as plastic as they come all mouth on twitter can't fill their ground tho, pep just buys his success and it's all funded by a Qatari oil tycoon who treats the people of his country like shit. This aint a win for Wigan it's a win for football
915 2018-02-19 22:06:18 Hahahahahaha hahaa oil fucks
916 2018-02-19 22:06:14 how do you cool your brain down? where does the oil go? what kind do i need?
917 2018-02-19 22:06:13 UK gov controls inward investment eg should a Japanese car co. decide to build a massive car plant in the UK, where do you think it will go?
Not Scotland.
PS what happened to all the oil?
918 2018-02-19 22:06:09 Out on the Atlantic creating havoc with the environment looking for oil. So 20th Century.
919 2018-02-19 22:06:06 @stevenfurtick has helped revolutionise my faith and relationship with God! Love you Pastor! Have a superb birthday! Plus may the oil ever increase! 
920 2018-02-19 22:05:53 Demy didn't have Azerjeben's oil money pumped into her performance though...
921 2018-02-19 22:05:50 However, an interesting experiment would be to empty the contents of a McDonald's deep fat fryer over Donald Trump. A KFC one would be kinder, since the oil would be cold at present.
922 2018-02-19 22:05:36 They have the credibility of snake oil salesmen

927 2018-02-19 22:05:20 But what happens when the Oil dries up 
928 2018-02-19 22:05:20 In GA in the summer u must not put Vaseline on. It will turn into cooking oil. Fish fry rdy
929 2018-02-19 22:05:05 Only one club in manchester do big thing's and it's certainly not a oil human rights abusers one.
930 2018-02-19 22:05:00 Sour grapes, historically you would think Man City fans knew how to lose, maybe oil money has given them a false sense of invincibility! #FACup #WIGMCI  Congratulations Wigan Athletic
931 2018-02-19 22:04:48 BC has the right to lose jobs as well when no oil or grain ships your way either then Who needs jobs? right??

938 2018-02-19 22:03:55 All that oil money just to lose to a English Mvela league team. Priceless 
939 2018-02-19 22:03:49 They must have been having mental break downs before the oil money
940 2018-02-19 22:03:47 same man who pushed for reducing sanctions so Exon's deal with Russia could continue. same man who says sanctions are unnecessary, because the threat is enough deterrent. same man GOP confirmed without Democrat votes. same man who represents oil that funds Congressional GOP.
941 2018-02-19 22:03:33 What's the point of being 16 points ahead of us if you lose to Wigan? You're a shallow money club, with no fans, mercenary players, who are funded entirely through oil. This was your chance to match Utd of 99. And you blew it. You'll be forever in our shadow, so get used to it.

Unless we destroy the death culture, u will need to ban steak knives too before u will see any lessening of violence

950 2018-02-19 22:03:00 Man City 27, shots on target, Wigan 4 shots on target, 1 that counted and that, ladies and gentleman is all that matters. It's good for the game that the oil funded mercenaries have had their wings clipped.
951 2018-02-19 22:02:59 I know he was kidding bro. I was being a smart ass
952 2018-02-19 22:02:50 That’s why they were dispensable. It was a commentary on how poorly workers in the oil fields are treated. It’s a modern day Ford Plant dilemma.
953 2018-02-19 22:02:43 Yeah they’ve been found out! Hopefully other teams will believe they can beat Peppy and his “oil rich” mercenaries haha
954 2018-02-19 22:02:43 I’m not acting like anything I’m just enjoying the fact that you lost to Wigan with all of your oil money hahahhah and because your club was also founded in 2009

958 2018-02-19 22:02:33 No worries on that, but you know how Tories and Scottish WC people mix.
Makes oil and water look easy
959 2018-02-19 22:02:32 @ManCity lose to @LaticsOfficial and their fans smash up the ground and @aguerosergiokun lashes out at a Wigan fan

Your Oil Money may buy you titles but it will never buy you Class

#FACup #WIGMCI
960 2018-02-19 22:02:25 How very odd! Oil paints don't usually react in that manner. If you used Bob Ross paints the painting should still be very wet. Perhaps something hit against it?
961 2018-02-19 22:02:19 Alex literally checks her oil every other day
962 2018-02-19 22:02:05 Man City would be Wigan without the oil money.
963 2018-02-19 22:02:03 me: tries to wash the olive oil pip spilled on nica's mat
pip: oh let me just get my nasty little paws all over it first so I can track oily prints all over the floor
964 2018-02-19 22:02:02 one) avoid sodium lauryl/laureth sulfate or alcohol/alcohol denat. in the ingredients
two) get a nice cleanser for ur skin
like garnier clearly brighter gentle exfoliating cleanser
three) sheet masks a couple times a week like snail, red wine, or aloe
four) i use sweet almond oil

967 2018-02-19 22:01:26 Typical pep wankfest Brian. Little Wigan put the oil barons to bed

Northside really is something else, huh? 

{She asked, in spite of herself, as she tore off a hunk of her bread and dipped it into the oil as directed. Some of it dripped down onto her hand and she hastily~

972 2018-02-19 22:00:52 So I just went to @bathbodyworks and just wanted to pick up a couple of 3 wick candles. But then I get distracted by the new Amber & Argan scent and end up walking out with the fragrance mist, perfume oil, and body scrub on top of the two candles. #ithinkihaveaproblem

991 2018-02-19 21:59:25 Big oil is subsidized everywhere, so don't be offended.
992 2018-02-19 21:59:25 Classless #ManCity fans at the end there. Got lucky winning the oil money lotto a few years ago, but don't deserve a seat at the top table.
993 2018-02-19 21:59:23 Sanctions, blocking assets of many oligarchs, preventing an oil deal that would have greatly improved Russia’s economy (and the wealth of Putin & Manafort), informing the candidates of the intelligence, authorizing intelligence agencies to investigate & give regular reports...

996 2018-02-19 21:59:14 Bitumen isn’t refined in Canada. KM pipeline will transport oil for Asia market. Either way oil will still be imported.
997 2018-02-19 21:59:14 Well done city fans in the away end. 

5 minutes ago you were Wigan til the oil money came in.

Take your L with some grace
998 2018-02-19 21:59:10 Abu Dhabi not Qatar but I agree with your point. They had won fuck all before the oil money.
999 2018-02-19 21:59:08 Top of the prem, oil rich, still Wigan’s bitch. #MCFC

1004 2018-02-19 21:58:47 An oil based lubricant sounds just the ticket for a nice smooth ride - Thanks! Now, I don't suppose you also have a buttplug that doubles as an Allen key? This flatpack furniture won't assemble itself!
1005 2018-02-19 21:58:42 Also very unwelcoming of you to keep the passage from Calais restricted. What is wrong with you ppl? These are refugees fleeing for lives.

1009 2018-02-19 21:58:28 You can directly trace both the Bush and Clinton families to the upending in the Middle East and North Africa. The wars are not to stop terrorism. It’s to create them and to lay the foundation for an oil pipeline to Israel and Europe to cut Russian exports.
1010 2018-02-19 21:58:24 THROW ANOTHER 500 MILLION OF OIL MONEY AT IT

1011 2018-02-19 21:58:23 Have my hair in a high pony, covered in almond and castor oil and feel strangely ready for tomorrow.
1012 2018-02-19 21:58:21 It's a tad difficult to do any reclamation when the area you are referring to is still in production. Reclamation happens AFTER the area is finished producing in the oil sands.

1019 2018-02-19 21:58:05 if this little imbroglio over Curl-P is "snake oil" to you, then every single cryptocurrency is snake oil to you. every single project has a similar snafu, or far worse

the issue is not #IOTA , but your lack of sound judgment about what transpired

software projects are messy
1020 2018-02-19 21:58:04 Excellent FIND!  Good to know about this company's bags. Interesting they are polymer based; so still using oil, but not so bad if they degrade in light.  Not as good as totally biodegradable I'm thinking.

1031 2018-02-19 21:57:23 City fans in that away end should be ashamed, too big for their boots after a few years of success, fuelled by oil money.

1034 2018-02-19 21:57:16 I could definitely bring oil with me but the cartridges are pretty expensive and I tend to go through them very quickly. I'd also rather not travel with it if I don't have to when I'm with my kids.
1035 2018-02-19 21:57:15 coconut oil & lavender essential oil, a great mix on your skin.........

1065 2018-02-19 21:53:01 According to my favourite toxicologist, much of the ‘CBD Oil’ he tests contains enough THC to make it fall foul of the MoDA. Caveat Emptor. Agree that revision is needed. But simplistic ‘just reschedule’ tweets mislead.
1066 2018-02-19 21:52:56 All that oil money and City couldn't win? Football
1067 2018-02-19 21:52:32 @SKWKRIMS Loose against farmers .. City shit no history Oil money
1068 2018-02-19 21:52:31 I love some oil massage videos. Lesbian ones obviously.
1069 2018-02-19 21:52:27 Okay, I'm raising my hand to get clarification, for myself.
I believe in socially responsible behavior in a fiscally responsible manner.
Which includes universal health care, and education.
The free market is fine, but only in controlled boundaries. No more oil barons.
1070 2018-02-19 21:52:27 This is fantastic. Guys are ahead.
With oil levels dropping.this is the next best thing.
Then Africa will have them from 2060 onwards at exorbitant prices!
Slow Africans!
Ever following after others!
Ever begging!
1071 2018-02-19 21:52:24 @TeamCavuto  Alaskan residents receive "royality" checks from oil revenues.  That program has been in effect since I lived there in the late 70's, if not longer.  You had to be a permanent resident to qualify.
1072 2018-02-19 21:52:23 600 million spent and lost to wigan tell me more about spending oil money in waste.
1073 2018-02-19 21:52:09 Karma for all that oil money they spend to win trophies
1074 2018-02-19 21:52:06 The least they could do is kill them first!  (I know... Their meat would spoil), but THIS is beyond inhumane! This is EVIL.  Like how Asians drop dogs into boiling oil, or skin them ALIVE! They say it improves the FLAVOR??!!  WE ARE OUT of SYNC with this PLANET!!!

*runs to my essential oil collection*
*dumps lavender,lemon, and tea tree all over myself*
*dumps same oils in diffuser*
*thinks I am untouchable to any sickness ever*
1118 2018-02-19 21:48:39 WHY?! We are bleased with the regular ones made with butter or oil. 
Are companies that desperate to make use of every kind of ingredient they possess?
1119 2018-02-19 21:48:38 Oh thank you! I'm very anti palm oil at the moment
1120 2018-02-19 21:48:32 YESSSSSSSSSS FUCK OFF OIL CITY

Another reason to ask for more oil money.. #welldonepep
1122 2018-02-19 21:48:21 It’s so annoying when the Touch ID doesn’t work on my iPhone like c’mon you already know it’s me with a little bit of oil from my slice of pizza
1123 2018-02-19 21:48:08 Yes I eat raw coconut oil. If you have a problem with this I’ll turn on my location and you can come fight me.
1124 2018-02-19 21:48:06 Being a car owner is all fun and games until it’s time to buy 6 quarts of oil, get the seats cleaned and get tint 
1125 2018-02-19 21:48:00 I dunno.. why don’t you ask @SenateMajLdr? Not that he will tell the truth or anything. Republicans and telling the truth are like oil and vinegar..
1126 2018-02-19 21:47:59 You could substitute Coconut oil with pure desi Ghee and try to blend coffee with Ghee and a scoop of Vanilla flavoured protein powder, you will get a rich creamy coffee with all the benefits to loose fat and gain muscle
1127 2018-02-19 21:47:56 IBS treatment on the NHS is awful. I just get sent home with peppermint oil tablets.
1128 2018-02-19 21:47:46 Albertans really gotta stop their incessant whining. Where has all the wealth from oil gone? Where's the Heritage Fund? Why is Alberta in debt? Invest in renewable energy sources now, shut the tar sands down, it's 2018.

1130 2018-02-19 21:47:02 I have an italian vinaigrette made with oil & vinegar that sounds like what might've ended up being added to your sandwich. When that mixes with mayo it get pretty runny. Did you let the store know so they could fix it for you and make it right?
1131 2018-02-19 21:46:40 You got one! If you want to be even quicker buy tinned potatoes, toss in oil and seasoning. Not proper roasties but good for a fry up!
1132 2018-02-19 21:46:39 I hated the man in the White House before President Trump, and yet never said horrible things about him.  He reminded me of a sleazy snake oil salesman, and all of you bought it and used the shit.
1133 2018-02-19 21:46:34 Eh the face mask didn’t hurt to much just a sharp second of my hair being slightly ripped out. As for the other things she got me that coconut oil lotion is gonna make my face soft as fuck (my skin is soft as it is)
1134 2018-02-19 21:46:30 Bath with eucalyptus oil!

1147 2018-02-19 21:44:42 I am pretty sure there is another way to get that oil! Screw the May government!
1148 2018-02-19 21:44:30 That is FUCKING brilliant idea man like I was thinking a fizz power up or oil power up but man
1149 2018-02-19 21:44:29 We didn't just go new formula on our shave oil, we updated our bottle too. It now comes with an ergonomic, locking pump that prevents leaks while you’re on the go. Because we know on the go is what you do. #thrivecareOTD #sustainability #farmtoface #naturalskincare #mensgrooming
1150 2018-02-19 21:44:20 Come on Wigan have these oil cunts 
1151 2018-02-19 21:44:18 I put coconut oil in my hair cause I wanted to try it but why didn’t anybody tell me it smelled like puke
1152 2018-02-19 21:44:05 Put a whole bunch of garlic cloves covered in butter ,olive oil and chili   flakes in oven for about 15-20 ,take out ,bake ur bread ,slop it on (not a very appetizing word ) toss on some grated parm ,put back in till it oozes yumm ,take out .Eat .Et voila !
1153 2018-02-19 21:44:05 Its coconut oil based
1154 2018-02-19 21:43:57 Do you work for Gas Oil or Coal ? - understand why you would want to ruin this invention !
1155 2018-02-19 21:43:50 Okay. The trapped in an oil painting... is that a reference to Rose Madder by Stephen King?
1156 2018-02-19 21:43:45 Too worried about my weight and how I look. Stresses me out and gives me anxiety.
1157 2018-02-19 21:43:41 The place where I use to get my oil changed had an autographed pic of Zandig in his Icon gimmick. Sad they had it tacked up, it deserved a frame.
1158 2018-02-19 21:43:41 Im an oil painter, watercolor never again so Im gonna follow you so I can enjoy yours:)
1159 2018-02-19 21:43:36 1/2 Hey @stellacreasy who can we contact concerning an oil spill on the river Lea which crosses Walthamstow Marshes?From reports dead...
1160 2018-02-19 21:43:35 My anointing oil didn’t waste
1161 2018-02-19 21:43:33 It's Nic, tomorrow, with the cut wrist #thearchers #deathinambridge
1162 2018-02-19 21:43:28 I really have an issue with this though. I have family in Calgary, who work in Oil and Gas, and who have children who attend school. School age children should not be made to feel like their parents are working in a terrible profession.
1163 2018-02-19 21:43:27 "Lay your head down on me baby,

1168 2018-02-19 21:42:59 Big OIL Big ELECTRIC will be buying this invention and hiding it in the closet - this could hurt their PROFITS !
1169 2018-02-19 21:42:55 Maybe he could catch a lift on one of his oil buddies tanker ships.
1170 2018-02-19 21:42:52 Potential misuse by politicians very high. With the case of #CSG #Whistleblower - the same day #Santos lobbied Ministers involved with unit - police arrived looking for her. She had been exposing well leaks & oil contaminated aquifer on facebook. They were monitoring her page.
1171 2018-02-19 21:42:49 You are literally working to harm our ability to resist a dictatorship.  You've been throwing around ad hominem for about 24 hours straight, so don't bitch when it gets thrown back.

You're clearly working for somebody trying to establish a dictatorship in America, by your logic.
1172 2018-02-19 21:42:05 The world will never know how sad I am

1174 2018-02-19 21:41:37 He arrived on a weekend, today is family day. He's entitled to spend the day with his family. The talks will be about trade. Something our last PM didn't do, unless it concerned oil. I'm also glad to see his kids are seeing different cultures #OpenMindedAboutOtherCutures
1175 2018-02-19 21:41:33 Oil revs the engines of transportation. It is still a big utility. Until tesla builds self driving battery powered ones.  Solar becoming cheaper every day, will reduce the heat going into athmosphere.
1176 2018-02-19 21:41:31 whenever i feel remotely stressed i j put in a ton of lavender oil in @aeasterling74 ’s diffuser & hope it works
1177 2018-02-19 21:41:31 Green tea makes a great natural toner. If you add a wee bit of tea tree oil it can help with any existing pimples, especially when they are fresh.
1178 2018-02-19 21:41:01 Probably work well here. We should do that.

1187 2018-02-19 21:39:41 If he pays for my oil change and gas he can
1188 2018-02-19 21:39:41 Well, I can say with a certainty that 340 degree oil is way too much fun. I'm going to disappear. I'm want to keep this happy go lucky feeling with a cigar or get ready to bring my warden back tomorrow. Either way, I'm going to bring some long needed hatred back.
1189 2018-02-19 21:39:38 I live in the UK.  Only SWAT and special units are armed.

1191 2018-02-19 21:38:58 It is the Only cool thing about Electric cars. and the ONLY thing. 
What is Never published, is how much Energy is Wasted in Building the batteries that they use Vs. Oil. 
Oil is still cheaper and Cleaner that Electric.

1193 2018-02-19 21:38:47 I just want everyone to know that I’m getting my oil changed for the first time in like a year and a half lmao

1197 2018-02-19 21:38:32 Like Denmark?
Leftist policies subsidised by oil, 60% of people work for the state, massive taxes (60% at £30k) and exorbitant living costs?
That "success".
You're going to have to learn the hard way young man.

1202 2018-02-19 21:38:10 The NRA is as easy to understand as the tobacco lobby and the oil and gas lobby. Their number one goal is to protect the business of selling guns. And they spend a ton of money on crooked politicians to do that.
1203 2018-02-19 21:37:56 Most cops in England are unarmed.
1204 2018-02-19 21:37:53 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!
1205 2018-02-19 21:37:46 You're not even Wigan with an oil field.
1206 2018-02-19 21:37:30 If I have to spend an hour or more at the dealership to get the oil changed on my day off, at least they have free packs of crackers and bottled water and Love It or List It on the TV.
1207 2018-02-19 21:37:29 That looks so delicious :o What kind of seasonings do you have on it? And is it just olive oil?

1211 2018-02-19 21:36:24 No doubt things were better for most Libyans under Ghaddafi than they are now.
Utter chaos & desperation rule in Libya, as opposed to free healthcare, education & baby bonuses under Ghadaffi's dictatorship
Only the US who want to drive down the price of oil & gas, were his enemy.
1212 2018-02-19 21:36:21 You shine !!!! Like baby oil on patent leather
1213 2018-02-19 21:36:17 Bill Molno and Vince Alascia did the art on the story inside the book called "Hirohito's Brigade" from which the Lichtenstein swiped the image without credit. After he retired from comics, Bill sold his own watercolors and oil painting. I doubt he got wealthy.

1227 2018-02-19 21:34:49 Bullroar.  As if the Saudi Arabian and Israeli lobby don't exercise "influence" on US politics?  Not to mention complete corporate domination of both major parties by the donor class, Wall Street, Big Oil, Big Pharma, Big Defence.  The whole system is a sham.
1228 2018-02-19 21:34:46 Joe, this is the stupidest argument ever. Look at the number of car owners vs the number of gun owners. 

And, OH YEAH CARS ARENT DESIGNED TO KILL THINGS!!

Cars have a function. Cars keep the oil companies rich.
1229 2018-02-19 21:34:35 I used to go out on the farm and try to emulate those kids by riding my bike into barrels of oil or underneath combine harvesters. I still bear the scars 30 odd years later. Still falling off bikes too. TV really is a bad influence...
1230 2018-02-19 21:34:29 You forget or missed the news, SDF let Russian companies get into their oil fields last Automn. Looking fo business. USA said nothing.
SDF want to stay cool with Russia.

It's still a Utopia Americans should aspire to far as we know.

1254 2018-02-19 21:31:36 @forduk I bought a new Ford van in 2014. Since then, faulty steering, faulty alarm, faulty door hinges. NOW the oil pump is faulty which has caused the engine to cease working! Ford’s response to the £6k bill I face, sorry you’ve done over £150k miles, so no goodwill! Disgraceful
1255 2018-02-19 21:31:34 I need some oil
1256 2018-02-19 21:31:19 Omg... Thank you!  I was actually just looking at flavored olive oils online,  so I can make my own yummy salad dressings. This is perfect!  Cheaper,  too!  Instead of flavored oil,  I'll make flavored vinegar for dressings.

1259 2018-02-19 21:30:41 Even if those that are standing were to lie down too,their total number would still be just a drop in the ocean in comparison to the million+++ Iraqis murdered by the US war machine for oil.
1260 2018-02-19 21:30:38 The oil industry used a Saskatchewan-Alberta competition (with Brad Wall duped into helping) to reduce royalty costs.
1261 2018-02-19 21:30:30 EQ, by many measures, has the highest GDP per capita on the continent, especially when oil prices are $60+. EQ should look like Norway, not like, well, EQ.

1265 2018-02-19 21:30:10 Avocado oil is a healthy alternative to vegetable oils. Avocado oil is rich in monounsaturated fats like olive oil, but it is stable at h...
1266 2018-02-19 21:30:06 Sweet, because if we keep powering the world with oil we'll need somewhere besides Earth to live anyway!
1267 2018-02-19 21:30:05 Coconut oil (food grade, not cosmetic), can help his skin feel better.  It’s a natural antibiotic so heals rashes and sores made from scratching. I smear it all over my cat when he starts scratching due to allergies.  Won’t make him sick if he licks it.
1268 2018-02-19 21:30:04 I need me some tea tree oil yho ha.a 
1269 2018-02-19 21:29:52 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles.
1270 2018-02-19 21:29:35

1272 2018-02-19 21:29:14 
1273 2018-02-19 21:28:56 I was literally next in line about to pull in to get my oil changed and realized I didnt have my wallet 
1274 2018-02-19 21:28:36 The question that keeps bugging me is the Conservative Party seems to have lowered the bar for it's MPs to such a point that charlatans, snake oil salesman and self serving populist candidates are being elected leading to the erosion of the UK's economic world standing.
1275 2018-02-19 21:27:42 Three things I believe:
1. Some of Peterson's views have been caricatured.
2. Many of the views for which he is attacked should be uncontroversial.
3. Once you get past that, he's clearly using No. 2 to try to sell some pickup artist snake oil.
1276 2018-02-19 21:27:42 Plus crude oil or grease ?
1277 2018-02-19 21:27:39 Maybe if you drop your pipecleaners in a cup with alcohool and somewhat of vanila oil can get a good work
1278 2018-02-19 21:27:32 Look up young living essential oils. They’re pure oils and can help in a variety of ways. I use an oil diffuser for helping me concentrate with production and stress. Different oils help in different ways. Try eucalyptus oil with a diffuser it can help with both sinuses & cough
1279 2018-02-19 21:27:32 It was time for new brakes and what not. They told me at last oil change, but lordt.
1280 2018-02-19 21:27:18 Some girl just called AAA saying her boyfriend went to change her oil and drained her transmission fluid instead by accident I can't stop laughing
1281 2018-02-19 21:27:13 When should we bring tubers of yam and palm  oil ?
1282 2018-02-19 21:26:47 They can have Alberta its just run by oil companies anyway, its not really a province.

The only condition is track all #methaneleak & pay #carbontax on them.  So #LNG exports dont harm #climate worse.

1286 2018-02-19 21:25:33 As for margarine, people can make vegan versions with coconut oil and dairy free milk if they so choose--real foods, not chemicals. But of course it's unnecessary in one's diet.

1288 2018-02-19 21:25:02 The Sudanese economy never recovered from the blow dealt to it by the secession of South Sudan,d newborn country had most of the crude oil that made up about 90% of foreign exchange income.

1292 2018-02-19 21:24:03 No, probably someone who benefits directly from AB producing oil and likely has lots of friends and family in the same boat. It appears that way via the insults, indicating an emotional reaction and a strong belief in what they were told. I would suggest avoiding insults back

1310 2018-02-19 21:20:55 Everyone bar oil city fans actually. He did this at barca too, calling out officials to protect his players, then allowing them to dive and playact until the Spanish fa had enough. Problem is that our fa in the sheikhs pocket

1325 2018-02-19 21:19:56 Could you explain how it's SNPs fault that the $1trillion oil fund is missing...?

The one our neighbors have?

And can you explain why businesses (and thus jobs) are being thrown out of Scotland under the guise of "public interest" immigration rules?

And why brexit will help?
1326 2018-02-19 21:19:31 Or one large, comfy with space for them to share. In Sweden we have a (not very, but w ) name for shops selling "manly stuff" like tools, car parts, oil etc. "Gubbadagis" or "man-creche".. Somewhere to store them without fear of them getting bored while you shop or fika

Would be a good thing if you would be able to have this being followed too. Transport busting etc, as you are following the KRG oil, of interest

1533 2018-02-19 20:51:31 They told me in 4th grade that we would be out of oil by 2020. We now have so much oil that we may never run out. Also back then they were talking about putting coal dust on the ice caps to melt them to stave off global cooling. Like you, I just want entertainment, not a lecture.
1534 2018-02-19 20:51:25 Well Pep is the greatest manager of all time, isn’t he. Not reliant on Qatari oil billions whatsoever. Tactical genius.
1535 2018-02-19 20:51:24 Interesting. Could you call up Jack, have him ready, for Dallas game, completely scratch JQ, not have to suit up at all if his body needs the rest, maybe fesh oil or glue, lol. (Or DK, if needbe), knowing the games/schedule coming up?
1536 2018-02-19 20:51:23 Your body looks great ,, SUN IS LUCKY WHEN CAN SEE YOU AND TOUCH YOU,,
1537 2018-02-19 20:51:10 I am a proud Christian but concerned that there is no unity in the body of Christ. Where could we be if we were given the oil rich part of the world? Make an effort today to love your neighbour.
1538 2018-02-19 20:51:10 after soaking my destroyed oil painting brushes in laundry detergent for two weeks, they are actually somewhat usable? i've seen everything now.
1539 2018-02-19 20:51:09 The place where we usually get our oil deliveries went out of business without telling any of their clients =_=
1540 2018-02-19 20:51:07 IPA are snake oil salesmen hired by corps to spruik free market, small gov, anti regulation claptrap in simplistic sound bites for the masses to easily digest. That's why they try to fill every media space relying on repetition & obfuscation instead of hard data & logical debate.
1541 2018-02-19 20:51:06 Aww maaannn thanks Nikki!!! You sho sweeeeet!!
It was the “flat oil brush” in CSP and that “soothing water color” smudger thing!!!
1542 2018-02-19 20:51:04 It says made in ghana raw coconut oil
1543 2018-02-19 20:51:03 ７月１０日はオイルの日。「７１０」を逆さにすると「ＯＩＬ」に見えるから
1544 2018-02-19 20:50:57 ชอบอ่ะ
1545 2018-02-19 20:50:56 But does this single recipe use £1 of oil, 65p of flour, 80p is sugar etc?
1546 2018-02-19 20:50:40 Then the ball and your leg are covered in oil, wipe the ball on the grass 
1547 2018-02-19 20:50:37 We like oil and water, we just don't mix..
1548 2018-02-19 20:50:34 You might want to have a look at elements of the AB climate plan, including the fact that emissions from oil sands face a higher marginal carbon price than any emissions in Canada anywhere other than BC.
1549 2018-02-19 20:50:21 Iraq is providing Jordan with oil for a very low price. The question is: what is Jordan providing in return?
1550 2018-02-19 20:50:20 it's been a day that my recently bleached hair is drenched in cononut oil and i can tell that the poor thing is loving it
1551 2018-02-19 20:50:19 I am in the suburbs with all the dads, all of us waiting for our oil changes to be done.

1555 2018-02-19 20:50:07 Let us take care of your tire rotations while we change your oil... YES, we do tires too!
1556 2018-02-19 20:50:02 Have you tried the Vitamin E range?  I use that mostly, they do a lovely creamy night cream and their vit E facial oil would be great for dry skin.  Also the brand Avene do a fab rich hydrating cream which I used to use for dry skin from harsh winters, that's a lovely product.
1557 2018-02-19 20:49:51 I am not a highlighter kinda girl but hell @ABHcosmetics and @norvina1 might change my mind... I am so tempted the get the Amrezy highlighter.... I get so scared because oil slick face haha!!

1559 2018-02-19 20:49:29 Sucks hey Bruce, now you know how we feel!Also when we stop sending you oil you won’t be able to run your tractors to harvest your grapes.
1560 2018-02-19 20:49:27 If Alberta runs out of oil and the naysayers are correct, the world will be a very different place than it is now. By your own logic, we'll either figure out how to do without or we'll kill the planet. I'm just saying we'll sell you oil until you make a decision. Buy local.

1563 2018-02-19 20:49:23 I still have mineral rights on my Mom's lands though I sold surface rights back to her tribe. Just in case gold, silver, precious gems or oil is discovered. Even water.
1564 2018-02-19 20:49:22 he need to massage his scalp wit some oil and do the inversion method to get blood flowing to that part of his hair line. he prolly just don’t give a fuck tho.
1565 2018-02-19 20:49:21 Have you also forgot he had like 35 Russian diplomats expelled from America? Plus nobody has forgot that besides the election there was the big oil deal between Russia, Exxon, Tillerson, & surely you to lift those sanctions and not impose new ones which you refuse to do! Treason!
1566 2018-02-19 20:49:12 start taking oil ;)
1567 2018-02-19 20:48:59 みんなオイルが好きだよね⁇あん⁇嫌い⁇嫌いとか言うならオイル使われてる食品も製品も食べるなよ使うなよwwwwww? ガソリンもオイルだよ⁇www 車も乗るなよwww? 野菜だけ食ってろよwwww ベジタリアンテラワロスwwwwwww
1568 2018-02-19 20:48:26 Let me tell you ! Black African soap you can get it at Target and get a Vitamin c oil for your face. Thank me later
1569 2018-02-19 20:48:16 I think the whole plastic bottle campaign has exploded because it's something people can act on.  Ie buy a reusable bottle. We need the government and the private sector To Help with changes like oil for transport #ethicalhour
1570 2018-02-19 20:47:57 Why pennzoil be trynna juice money out of me every time i get my oil changed with em .

"Yeah bro youre supposed to get yo car air freshener changed every 15 weeks, we can get u a new one rn for like 56.99 if you want?"
1571 2018-02-19 20:47:54 Ha ha double standards that Oil tycoons toy
1572 2018-02-19 20:47:49 Progressives are incremental. We know this. Why they are called progressive. Like Pine Bark Beatles they destroy whatever is in path.
1573 2018-02-19 20:47:48 Hey, oil is leaking out of that piece of truck you drive.   Please put some kitty liter under it in the parking lot.  
1574 2018-02-19 20:47:44 Wish somebody can oil my scalp
1575 2018-02-19 20:47:40 Pep going mental and showing himself to be one of the biggest hypocrites in football. If that challenge was on one of his he’d be calling for red. Sickening challenge and his coaches man handling Wigan manager. Oil can buy players but not class

1579 2018-02-19 20:46:57 norma so good to me. she came to my job and picked up my car to get my oil changed 
1580 2018-02-19 20:46:34 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
1581 2018-02-19 20:46:28 Everybody in Wakanda got that Vibranium beard oil. Plug me lol.
1582 2018-02-19 20:46:25 Shea butter + sweet almond oil. You’re welcome.
1583 2018-02-19 20:46:12 As I said I look at both sides. I would like to replace oil fields with geothermal or solar plants. But if we got rid of all oil and gas tomorrow, what happens to the 350k employed. How do cars or buses or planes run with no production?
1584 2018-02-19 20:46:11 i thought that was a picture of dead leaves in the mud! haha whoops.... 

mind you.. i sometimes like burned kale, it goes nice and salty if its overcooked in the oven sometimes. add a bit of olive oil and it could almost be like seaweed in a chinese :)
1585 2018-02-19 20:45:57 Honteux tweet signalé
1586 2018-02-19 20:45:49 Damn I really burned my face with some hot ass oil :( and now my face looks like shit more than usual :/
1587 2018-02-19 20:45:43 Got my oil changed. Gonna go home and watch Netflix the rest of the night. 
1588 2018-02-19 20:45:23 With statements like that no wonder the Russians laugh at us. Their concerns are probably NATO, oil and gas. Not to mention us attacking Syria which is their ally.
1589 2018-02-19 20:45:23 The olive oil tasting bar is pretty sweet too.
1590 2018-02-19 20:45:23 @IKEACanada calgary (oil town) has scrapped its hybrid parking for all electric. All empty. Shocking. #goingbackwards #babysteps
1591 2018-02-19 20:45:16 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1592 2018-02-19 20:45:16 A lot of oil does lol. I like to make a sandwich with chunks of these. Or a pizza crust
1593 2018-02-19 20:45:15 So people who aren’t paranoid oppose being prepared to keep the gov’t in line?  If I weren’t paranoid I would understand that it’s unnecessary?

You are literally wanting people barred from having a gun because it’s a good gun.
1594 2018-02-19 20:45:14 I made this pizza with Pepperoni and called it 'Spicy High Rise' because it also has red peppers over goat's cheese on Zaatar and olive oil on raised crust. @wine_bot_
1595 2018-02-19 20:45:12 Gotta love that oil money baby.
1596 2018-02-19 20:45:11 Citeh and Pep showing all the class that billions of dollars of oil money gives you #WIGMCI
1597 2018-02-19 20:45:08 Bill Gates has worn the mantle of his wealth responsibly.Unlike another alleged billionaire who shall rename nameless,Gates foundation donations are intelligent &profound. No charity funded oil paintings of Gates. You have a chance to redeem yourself. Think before you tweet.
1598 2018-02-19 20:44:59 Lets think.Scotlands "heavy" industries which were the core of its economy, wiped out, Scottish oil revenues  diverted to bolster Londons emerging finance industry.Ineffectual "opposion"in Scots Labour.Any wonder they turned to Smack?
1599 2018-02-19 20:44:47 One of my most cherished videos is just like, 4 girls, dancing naked together and rubbing body oil on each other. So simple. So wonderful. Yet it's the only video of it's kind. I specifically try not to watch it often, so that I will never tire of its perfection.
1600 2018-02-19 20:44:46 Me, anytime dealing with my car is inconvenient (registration, heater went out, new tires, fender bender, new transmission, oil change, etc): 
One day we'll all teleport places and not have to worry about this.
1601 2018-02-19 20:44:43 You can do it yourself Bree , soak a towel with olive oil and hot water and keep it on your eyes
1602 2018-02-19 20:44:32 Absolutely right.  Tillerson's interview on @60Minutes made it clear.  His non-answers to lack of staffing and failure to appoint ambassadors to over 20 countries was gob smacking.  He still sees himself as Exxon Oil, which is why he supports Trump's refusal to sanction Russia.
1603 2018-02-19 20:44:07 Ran over a thing last Thursday. Punctured my oil pan and did something to my transmission box
1604 2018-02-19 20:44:01 another hit of Gerin Oil and 500mg of Serum 114
1605 2018-02-19 20:43:59 Do you remember the wee doughnut machine that you could stand and watch them going along getting dipped in the batter then the oil and into the sugar at the end . The smell was amazing 
1606 2018-02-19 20:43:44 I could save schools fortunes by getting rid of all the snake oil systems they have now.  Have a bloody conversation with people, do some comparison with other schools. #primaryrocks
1607 2018-02-19 20:43:42 Remember the HIGH cost of Gas when President Obama can into office.. He stop oil company for ripping us OFF. Credit card companies doesn't over charge us anymore..... I see a lot of roads, new highways rebuilt because of President Obama
1608 2018-02-19 20:43:37 I spend $400 a month on my skin care regimen just so I can look like i'm coated in a thin layer of olive oil at all times
1609 2018-02-19 20:43:16 my dad used to say that oil was such an amazing substance that the last thing we should be doing with it is burning it - let's have contact lenses, plastic heart valves, acrylic jumpers, wellies..... Oil isn't evil #ethicalhour
1610 2018-02-19 20:43:09 Never really believed in Hell but Trump certainly seems like parolee from Hell! T is just plain old evil & whenever he opens his mouth vile words start flowing out! Hate and division (his specialty)has covered the nation like an oil spill! Question is when do we get the clean up?
1611 2018-02-19 20:43:04 Shea butter, coconut oil isn’t so great for most hair
1612 2018-02-19 20:43:03 The problem, be it oil or minerals, is how do you extract and export it in a country at war since decades. With broken down everything from infrastructure to local government? 
1613 2018-02-19 20:43:00 ‘Protecting pipelines for American oil companies’ doesn’t really fit in the recruitment ads that look like action holiday informercials
1614 2018-02-19 20:42:41 I’m sat in robs living room getting high on oil fumes, happy Monday
1615 2018-02-19 20:42:40 Critical: HOW FAST is product cooked after it's caught? Does small boat need to deliver catch to larger boat? How many hours does fish sit on deck or in poorly refrigerated quarters? Purity of oil in can is separate issue. Call producer to learn timeframe between catch/cook.
1616 2018-02-19 20:42:38 At LEAST third of a cup of olive oil, and even that takes a fair amount of experience.
1617 2018-02-19 20:42:33 Someone in my town has these two big-ass oil paintings of anthropomorphic cows dressed as tudors right in their front room, facing the street. They have gold frames and everything, and they’re on my walk route. Since I noticed them my life has never known peace
1618 2018-02-19 20:42:27 Why do we need a science expert?  We don't believe in climate change, our coal is being cleaned, and we are selling off our natural reserves.  And if we get those oil rigs off our coasts we certainly won't need any environmental rules.
1619 2018-02-19 20:42:22 Your wants my hand to be her masked oil on a mySQL database.
1620 2018-02-19 20:42:20 Black currant oil is extraordinarily high in vitamin C and is also rich in many other nutrients. It can greatly ease breast tenderness.
1621 2018-02-19 20:42:15 I really need to go get my oil changed
1622 2018-02-19 20:41:52 Increased my water intake to at least 4 lts a day and less caffeine by doing this and using pure coconut oil on my skin I have now got rid of that thick scale skin from my knee when it used to be at least 1cm thick
1623 2018-02-19 20:41:41 I really want to try CBD oil for my dysmenorrhea and back pain (bulging disc). I hate being high, but that’s my own personal pref. I just get super paranoid and I don’t enjoy it. I live in Texas but I thing the oil is legal here since there’s no THC? Idk. Any thoughts?
1624 2018-02-19 20:41:35 Sorry. Should have been more specific. Recipe. Butter/spread makes them hard so a little sunflower oil  does wonders.
1625 2018-02-19 20:41:26 Hahahahahaha, they have killed most people on this planet.
1626 2018-02-19 20:41:24 u could use olive oil mayhamps
1627 2018-02-19 20:40:51 Have been waiting at the @Kia dealership for two hours just for an oil change because they can’t find my maintenance plan. Wtf does that even mean? Every oil change I’ve gotten here has been covered by the maintenance plan and now it’s somehow “lost”???
1628 2018-02-19 20:40:29 No, the comments to your post with the whole McDavid vs Mathews debate regarding and the Oilers being a tire fire...they are, with McDavid and TO a playoff team with Mathews. Doesn’t make Mathews better,shows just how bad Oil management is that they fucked up a team with McDavid
1629 2018-02-19 20:40:15 Family Nutrition: #Pringles Cheddar Cheese this February? With less than 2% actual Cheddar Cheese, it has more salt, oil or MSG!

1631 2018-02-19 20:40:02 Always oil & gas. Hope you are aware that with the advent of new technologies in automobile & other oil consuming industries, oil & gas mkt would  soon begin to shrink?Today,not too many people remember coal that was once an indispensable source of energy.

1638 2018-02-19 20:39:08 Interesting. Combining a number between Hillary and Trump is like combining water and oil.

Since Trump is reported to have spent $61m on his own campaign, how much of the (combined hillary & trump) $81M was from Hillary?
1639 2018-02-19 20:39:04 13 isn't nonexistent, the bill actually increases allotment and even land exchange. I just read the bill referenced in the article. 

But the conveyance is definitely concerning. Big oil wants the large acres and only gives 1/8 fed lands back elsewhere? 6 mos-1 or 2 yrs?
1640 2018-02-19 20:38:49 Nice. What is its specialty? Fries? Air? Do you still need oil?
1641 2018-02-19 20:38:47 You have to schedule a date to get your oil changed. That way they can send you a lot of messages reminding you of what awesome customer service you are getting. And call you. And text you.
1642 2018-02-19 20:38:37 Trying to slick a can of oil who you think you foolin
1643 2018-02-19 20:38:28 How about NO assault weapons ?? And while we are at it - if a person chooses to seek political office he/she should do so without accepting ANY dark money -NRA, Big Pharma,oil/gas etc...if they can’t run on merits —don’t run
1644 2018-02-19 20:38:27 I am curious which industry/lobbying group donates the most to politicians:
Alcohol = DUI
Automotive = Polluting our planet
Tobacco = Increased health care costs
Oil = in cahoots with Auto
NRA = Gun ownership.

I know which one of the above donates the least. Want to take a guess
1645 2018-02-19 20:38:25  let me go ahead and oil my sticks up tonight
1646 2018-02-19 20:38:22 coconut oil is a blessing 
1647 2018-02-19 20:38:15 A Republican Native American? You do know he wants your land for oil right? Are you suggesting Democrats walk into THOSE schools and killed children? Are you suggesting that Democrats were asking for Gun Control so many other shootings will occur?
1648 2018-02-19 20:38:05 Allways the farmers that suffer. The oil companies? Not so much.
1649 2018-02-19 20:37:16 Ever try an ancient oil....works too. 
1650 2018-02-19 20:36:58 Nah the oil it's fried in would be suffice tbh 
1651 2018-02-19 20:36:47 Many years ago I predicted that Marvel phase 3 would be about a vibranium arms race in Wakanda reflective of the oil driven wars of the Middle East since it’s is the only material that could fight asgardian magic. After seeing Black Panther, I think I was just off by a few years.
1652 2018-02-19 20:36:35 #ethicalhour are we missing the complexity though? Plastic bottles are light so don't need so much energy to transport as tins. . We don't seem to be worried about using oil for burning for transport and plastic is at least using oil before it may be incinerated or recycled.
1653 2018-02-19 20:36:29 BC against the oil giants! Alberta needs to expand away from oil!
1654 2018-02-19 20:36:08 @jjhorgan @RachelNotley @JustinTrudeau Why don’t we keep the oil in Canada and help bring the price of gas down for everyone in Canada and make jobs!! It belongs to all Canadians! Not to make big oil even richer!!!
1655 2018-02-19 20:35:56 Other benefits include reducing our reliance on oil imports, increase jobs both in cities and in regional, rural and remote areas of Australia, and getting out of coal reduces the amount of black lung disease.

1657 2018-02-19 20:35:52 That hasnt stopped Trump overriding indigenous peoples' rights to protect their land from oil pipeline construction. Nor cutting UN funding for objecting to his building an embassy in Jerusalem. The only laws the far-right respect are their own.
1658 2018-02-19 20:35:47 You can’t quite beat the taste of molten hot oil seeping out of a Kiev and scalding your chin with buttery goodness.
1659 2018-02-19 20:35:41 Ask him to quantify more. 

That you know where Malabu is or that you know an oil deal went down doesn't mean you know shit about the Malabu deal. So quantify what you know and how it warrants putting GEJ on trial...

1662 2018-02-19 20:35:27 Here is the issue the way i see it. Majority of Black Americans comes from Hebrew Biafra. Support Biafra Jews and Christians REFERENDUM so they can enjoy their Heritage. British SLAVERY and Continued GENOCIDE of Biafrans for oil must stop.
1663 2018-02-19 20:35:24 Just had a shot of coffee with MCT oil...may sound weird but that stuff works greatttt!!! 
1664 2018-02-19 20:35:19 People who say you should have kids, are the same people who say 'Come in, the water's fine' while standing waist deep in boiling hot oil.
1665 2018-02-19 20:35:15 I dont want to make false claims, though I swear after sourcing the oil it helped cure my partners Cancer. Can I prove it ? NO, but I hunted it down and would do it again, god I hope I dont ever have to

1675 2018-02-19 20:34:07 Young ppl don't watch much MSM, imo & it's them that the article says are changing the narrative. I agree. Cdn oil & gas industry & govts. need to get that many young ppl would listen more to what they're saying if the lyrics to the refrain change to focus on #CleanEnergy
1676 2018-02-19 20:34:03 This dude just asked the owner of the car dealership if he buys a car, can he get the first three oil changes for free  I’m fucking dead
1677 2018-02-19 20:34:02 Singapore is a service economy, Norway struck oil at a very opportune time, Botswana has a very small population. None of these scenarios, which made successful sovereign funds possible, applies to SA.

1707 2018-02-19 20:30:20 It’s common to apply aloe or tea tree oil to skin to treat pimples.

1710 2018-02-19 20:29:42 It’s a long but not so long. I do protein treatment before my wash day. Egg, two tablespoons of honey and one tablespoon of olive oil. Apply and cover with a shower cap and leave for 2hrs. Wash off with shampoo and apply hot coconut oil and leave overnight

1713 2018-02-19 20:29:30 WHY are oil changes so expensive
1714 2018-02-19 20:29:29 Tillerson is BAD NEWS!!! He did not need a job when he retired as CEO from Exxon Mobile! He was recommended to be in this position because of a strong alliance to Putin!!! He has to protect his billions in Russian oil investments. Putin & Tillerson are attached at the hip!!!
1715 2018-02-19 20:29:28 Glad to know there's no good food in the house, we don't have any oil, thus the house is freezing and the water has been shut off. Not being able to shower all day is fan-fucking-tastic 
1716 2018-02-19 20:29:16 The snake oil of cynical neocons and neoliberals have moved the country so far to the right that a reasonable wage and healthcare are considered "extremist" positions. People like you set up the pins and fascists like Trump knock them down. You won't ever be elected for anything.

I am working with the Malaysian Palm Oil Council...
1722 2018-02-19 20:28:42 If you overlay maps where Russia has the biggest oil deposits and the areas which will be most affected by climate change, it’s terrifying. The dismantling of the State Dept and the EPA go hand-in-hand, I think. Who stands to make money in the long run.
1723 2018-02-19 20:28:35 I take coconut oil and collagen tablets...they work wonders
1724 2018-02-19 20:28:29 ااااااااايوه

1732 2018-02-19 20:27:52 Honestly, there’s nothing better than putting almond oil on your feet, and it doesn’t have to be after a shower which makes it so great. You can put it on your feet any time of the day. Then put socks on with slippers and let it sit for a while. Your feet will feel so soft.
1733 2018-02-19 20:27:48 Reminds me of one of my favourite jokes, from the Jennings books.

1741 2018-02-19 20:26:27 Don't shower with hot water. Coconut oil or hemp oil is so good for dry skin. Hot water is so bad for your skin.
1742 2018-02-19 20:26:22 It’s all about the oil. It’s what brings the Russians and Texans together to stop climate protection.
1743 2018-02-19 20:26:13 Listening to the snake oil salesmen across from me “our oils are distilled from the plants where jesus walked” uh huh.

1818 2018-02-19 20:15:03 Your making a case to disarm yourself. Your aim is not perfect, you may shoot someone else,  you can be overcome, gun used on you.
1819 2018-02-19 20:14:59 Your oil can actually be oxidized before even being bottled, oxydization starts immediately it's pressed, storing in giant vats before bottling. Bottled on pressing best

1821 2018-02-19 20:14:55 Two days in a row I had oil change appointments at NTB. Two days in a row I show up and they tell me it will be hours.
1822 2018-02-19 20:14:46 Well, Albertans need to up their game. Apparently there is a link between oil production and skiing.

1831 2018-02-19 20:13:57 Try a little bit coconut oil on a q-tip? Rub it on there gently and see if that helps loosen it up?
1832 2018-02-19 20:13:44 You can check on the dododex resources and which dinos are the best to gather them followed by how well they gather the materials. Stuff like oil, silica pearls and cementing paste can also be checked their to see which dinos can gather them. And yes, anklyos are best for crystal

1834 2018-02-19 20:13:34 The Walmart commercial with a Depeche Mode song in it made me all kinds of uncomfortable, kind of like mixing oil and milk.
1835 2018-02-19 20:13:23 Yes, we are mad at statues...STILL. Don't forget Trump is still the source of Evil in the US & we want everyone disarmed police, guards & we legal citizens so we get killed more easily by democrats. Ideally, conservatives should march in unison into a ditch of flaming diesel oil.

1847 2018-02-19 20:12:06 Worst thing to ever happen to me at work was a woman who complained about my donuts and asked me what oil I used and when I told her I didn’t know she told me I shouldn’t be working there if I didn’t know how to do my job
1848 2018-02-19 20:11:57 Have never seen this one. Oil keep my mincers peeled! ;)
1849 2018-02-19 20:11:51 Point is the oil  industry will do all it can for profit.  Then turn their back on communities, perhaps countries as well.  We must push for the development of the renewable energies.  The fossil fuel industry is not working in our best interest.
1850 2018-02-19 20:11:49 I was being sarcastic. And this "plan" will change nothing. Lower timelines help but it's all about the economics which means oil price and volatility.
1851 2018-02-19 20:11:45 Obvious and true that cdn politicians are allowing Americans to fund anti oil and resource  "branch plants" to damage our economy and manipulate our elections and the uninformed.
1852 2018-02-19 20:11:40 Ever hear of risk mitigation? Would be interesting to disarm police.

You would get 19% cut. But instead you’ll get to spend time behind bars!

1898 2018-02-19 20:06:40 If Alberta wants to make Canada oil self sufficient, then build refineries in Alberta and ship oil to the rest of Canada.

1927 2018-02-19 20:03:28 Hash oil, given than THC is lipid soluable, can be incredibly potent. Even made from low THC strains grown under less than favourable conditions, it can still be "whitey" material.
1928 2018-02-19 20:02:55 and what he REALLY wants to do (to keep his end of the bargain) is to lift the sanctions so Russia and Exxon can start drilling their billions of dollars worth of oil again.. Guess @BarackObama 's sanctions hit Putin where is really hurt, his personal wallet.
1929 2018-02-19 20:02:49 It’s extremely disappointing the way the US government denounces how North Korea’s government runs its country, while turning a blind eye to the situation in Venezuela. Why not put global pressure on Venezuela’s government too? Oh, I get it. #Oil

2088 2018-02-19 19:42:12 The result of US Shale Oils last big push and the increasing understanding that the Oil Rich around the World that the US will not protect their plebeian interests anymore.

Hard but good news.

China/US knows we are going renewable Electric sooner rather than later
2089 2018-02-19 19:42:04 the one upside to owning and using beard oil is now when I joke that "I live down in a van by the river and sleep in a racecar bed" it is taken as undeniable fact
2090 2018-02-19 19:42:03 Oh btw changing your pillow covers regularly is good for your face. Less dirt & oil and so on. 
2091 2018-02-19 19:42:03 yeah, i dont feel bad if people mute or unfollow me re the Oil bcos you are right that people want to consume social media in different ways. I have a tonne of people muted who are either attention-seekers or just talk about their boring lives all the time
2092 2018-02-19 19:41:52 I love paint. I like watercolours. I like acrylic paint... a little bit. I like house paint. I like oil-based paint, and I love oil paint. I love the smell of turpentine and I like that world of oil paint very, very, very much.
2093 2018-02-19 19:41:49 @_BrothersBeard where can I get the oil??
2094 2018-02-19 19:41:33 Last mild day for ages today. As me mate says... Better order the oil! Proper Winters on its way from Putinland!
2095 2018-02-19 19:41:21 Have you heard of our lord and savior CBD oil? Fucking back pain.
2096 2018-02-19 19:41:01 I'm sure Rex got the alt-right fossil fuel security clearance, okee doke.Where there is guns, oil, or laundered money,power decides who gets cleared.
2097 2018-02-19 19:40:47 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower

2102 2018-02-19 19:40:09 知ってる？スーパーってタダで牛脂くれるんだよ。
2103 2018-02-19 19:40:08 You're cute. Let's just try to stick to the oil conversation. If oil imports were curtailed in favour of Alberta oil, we can then talk about reducing your demand on our resources. In the meantime, how many batteries do you want? You might not like the shipping cost.
2104 2018-02-19 19:40:05 12 countries oil rich out of 50
2105 2018-02-19 19:40:05 an affordable emulsifying cleansing oil that also has refillable packs,,,,,,,,,
2106 2018-02-19 19:39:39 I think it can be bad for some people. I seem to get neuromuscular pains (like sciatica) whenever I eat coconut oil. I wouldn't believe it if I didn't keep a log and it's been consistent for years.
2107 2018-02-19 19:39:35 Bamco sounds like cooking oil company #BBNaija
2108 2018-02-19 19:39:30 Fed up with #Heating #Oil #suppliers? Do they know what #CustomerService is? Reckon @MartinSLewis should get stuck in to the heating oil industry #shakeitup
2109 2018-02-19 19:39:19 Now we need the energy complex (oil, nat gas, coal miners) to participate as well.
2110 2018-02-19 19:39:17 More like stressful. Ever tried handling a [handless] frying pan full of sizzling oil with a pair of pliers?
2111 2018-02-19 19:39:06 Some people never appreciate anything, I just gave this woman a 25kg bag of rice and she asking me, “where are the additives, oil, tin tomatoes and fish”. She always does this. It means I just need to stop giving her stuff
2112 2018-02-19 19:39:03 Didn’t see any Siren. Five Points great again but Neck Oil over carbed.
2113 2018-02-19 19:38:54 gave dan essential oil and it cured his stomach ache i’m a top tier witchy bitch
2114 2018-02-19 19:37:49 hi can you be more specific about alternative to palm? there are many species in the palm family such as coconut, dates and etc. if you,re refering to palm oil, is it the usage for biodiesel or other products?
2115 2018-02-19 19:37:47 i’m starting to believe the zebras have their own agenda. maybe it starts with usurping bettman by sinking his draft-lotto faithfuls in the oil.
2116 2018-02-19 19:37:47 « US stole half the oil and gas?!! »  First, let’s wipe ALL of them off the  map, then time will come to talk business & pleasure 
2117 2018-02-19 19:37:44 And Norway still make £2/£3billion a year in taxes on oil, outside the $1trillion oil fund they have.

And the UK has more oil reserves than Norway.

So the real question is do I trust the tories with my future who have squandered $1trillion, or am I better off with someone new?
2118 2018-02-19 19:37:42 Ok, I can't beat my moms recipe, 1 cup oatmeal, 2 cups whole milk, 1 tea spoon real butter, a dash of salt, oregano, garlic powder, parsley or cilantro. cook until thick, serve and once on plate, add 1table spoon of extra virgin olive oil. #nutrition #superfood #mindfuleating
2119 2018-02-19 19:37:36 cant eat it myself,,,deep fried in oil is the worst,,#kfc   i have healthy greggs me,,:)
2120 2018-02-19 19:37:28 Orangutan ~ Indonesia and Malaysia produce more than 85% of the worlds palm oil and are the only remaining homes for orangutans. Fewer than 80,000 of these animals survive today, their habitats are under constant threat and deforestation.  #palmoil #deforestation #wildlife
2121 2018-02-19 19:37:00 Dermalogica Special Cleansing Gel, Daily Microfoliant, Sebum Clearing Masque (once or twice a week), multi-active toner, oil control lotion and solar defense booster. If you have acne I'd also recommend overnight clearing gel and clearing mattifier for the day (under moisturizer)
2122 2018-02-19 19:36:49 Come on Wigan but realistically it’s 5-0 to oil club city
2123 2018-02-19 19:36:43 No for getting dungbeetles to produce a regular supply of oil
2124 2018-02-19 19:36:36 Unfortunately the politicians will do NOTHING and everything to avoid jeopardizing their income from the NRA. Very sad the lobbies have so much control. Same as oil and insurance lobbyists. Show how their going to get re-elected and then maybe something will happen.
2125 2018-02-19 19:36:30 Wow. How ironic that they are concerned about their jobs and families but not Albertans and more importantly BC residents who work in the Oil and Gas Industry.
2126 2018-02-19 19:36:27 I just ate garlic naan, with garlic infused olive oil drizzled on top, and garlic powder sprinkled on top #iLoveGarlic
2127 2018-02-19 19:36:18 i have a whole halved and scored aubergine, slathered in olive oil + honey, roasting away in the oven baby
2128 2018-02-19 19:36:05 Oil change this morning. Mileage = 348872. Also had them fix the alignment, which may help with the steering feeling a bit loose. The squeaking sound is a mystery. Then I got a haircut. There’s a coupon on the Great Clips receipt but who goes back for another haircut in 6 weeks?
2129 2018-02-19 19:36:04 Kitchen Pro Tip: If you stir coconut oil into your kale, it make it easier to scoop into the trash.
2130 2018-02-19 19:36:01 Yep, she invested in big pharma, big tobacco and big oil. Her bots troll me saying ALL mutual funds have at least 1 of these 3 in them. I call BS. Anyway, there's other ways to invest if she were really Green and not a money grubber.
2131 2018-02-19 19:35:56 Engine oil it is. For the engine that is YOUR BRAIN.
2132 2018-02-19 19:35:37 I  sweating...changed the oil I'm the mower..picked up limbs...cut grass and weed eated it's 77 here with some sun from time to time
2133 2018-02-19 19:35:34 When the truck comes to pick up the oil from the explained.
2134 2018-02-19 19:35:31 Watching an old wheel dealers with the VR6, if Edd was so good why didn’t he use the drain plug for the oil filter before removing it. #wheelerdealers
2135 2018-02-19 19:35:28 It's supposed to be hot, just need to add a lil more oil.
2136 2018-02-19 19:35:21 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
2137 2018-02-19 19:35:20 It's too soon to tell if this Restore Face Oil from Aura is working but I looooove the way it makes my skin feel after application. Even the scent is pretty soothing.
2138 2018-02-19 19:35:13 I hate oil in stew omg. Has to be the WORST
2139 2018-02-19 19:34:50 Make sure there is enough oil in the pan. Not tons, but enuf to keep the bottom lubricated.
2140 2018-02-19 19:34:47 They don’t mind their oil money then.
2141 2018-02-19 19:34:19 Predicting a ban. When shooters move to pistols what then? The resistance to take the REAL common sense steps, security, is strong.
2142 2018-02-19 19:34:13 Why do oil change places always claim to be 10-minutes or quicker when everyone knows that’s a lie.
2143 2018-02-19 19:34:03 Would much rather the flow of oil be as it is now instead of increasing it. Also would mean a lot more tankers coming in and out. Yeah that is also a massive risk increasing traffic when the routes are narrow

2145 2018-02-19 19:33:55 How will Americans get their illicit drugs if a wall is built? Trump sold the ignorant a bunch of snake oil and their pride won’t let them admit it. Its too much money in drug smuggling for a wall and the American gov’t is complicit in it.
2146 2018-02-19 19:33:48 Managed  to  get  oil  on  my  bastard  sofa

2152 2018-02-19 19:33:08 Maximal Reserve by Sam Batterman is a great read  It’s a what-if novel about the world’s largest oil reserve sitting directly under Israel and all the possible ramifications
2153 2018-02-19 19:33:03 LOL. Russia’s GDP is 18 times smaller than the US. 70% of it’s exports are oil and gas. It is you guys that want to raise the price of oil and gas to help Russia. Remember that next time you vote.
2154 2018-02-19 19:32:43 I'd like to say baby oil but you're probably right
2155 2018-02-19 19:31:58 Just imagine dean I& the Tories under thatcher the milk thief, the £350 billion in oil revenues had been invested in Scotland rather than waste it on reducing the debt! 
We would have been like Norway with a sovereign wealth fund!!
2156 2018-02-19 19:31:47 The guy paid for my oil change cause I was there too long 
2157 2018-02-19 19:31:46 Worked out, read for an hour, played some WWII and shit on some kids, fasted, there's nothing else do do on a Monday where you're off and the market is closed. I was gonna tan but our beaches are stagnant cesspools of oil and flesh eating microbes so what the fuck there is to do?
2158 2018-02-19 19:31:45 No time for oil changes during tire sales apparently.  Went to two different Big O's.  If you don't have time for my little purchase, don't expect my big purchases when my truck needs tires @bigotires

2164 2018-02-19 19:31:03 Ppl wake the F up!! Stop killing our animals for stupid palm oil! Read the labels before you buy & boycott all products with palm oil!
2165 2018-02-19 19:30:51 yeah if it's too wet it turns into mush rather than staying as individual grains. Other things to watch for are whether you're using enough oil and if your pan is hot enough
2166 2018-02-19 19:30:50 Because Norway invested all their oil money and now live off the returns. All Scottish oil money was spend through the Barnet Formula. 

And Sturgeon/Salmon said those repeatedly. It was even in the 'Brochure' whatever that was called.
2167 2018-02-19 19:30:46 Btw.... Link is to Vice's look at illegal oil refineries in Nigeria.

2175 2018-02-19 19:29:55 Best thing read today: “in 1399, Henry IV had himself anointed with a miraculous oil given to Thomas Becket by the Virgin Mary herself, though it seems to have given him headlice”

2176 2018-02-19 19:29:48 Chopped aloe up into pieces, soaked it in a glass of water, added a mint & green tea teabag, let it sit for a while, strained it out in a bottle and added a couple of drops of tea tree oil. It smells great and I think it works 
2177 2018-02-19 19:29:40 #ECO best oil junior around IMHO and none of the twatteratti are into it which must mean it's a proper company

Thanks 
2179 2018-02-19 19:29:27 also, to my knowledge the wash is part of the oil change!

2182 2018-02-19 19:29:05 I will award kudos to anybody who can tell me what Mike was about to say after the camera cut off. I will start: "I'm gonna go grease up in motor oil and try this again"
2183 2018-02-19 19:29:04 Not if they're having a tire sale.  No time for oil changes.  Went to two different Big O's.  If you don't have time for my little purchase, don't expect my big purchases.
2184 2018-02-19 19:28:33 Currently Doing My Homework On Protein Powder While I Wait For My Oil Change
2185 2018-02-19 19:28:18 Olive oil is considered good for you.  Bacon grease is considered bad for you.  Does that mean turkey tacos fried in a combination of the two are merely okay?
2186 2018-02-19 19:28:14 So, fellow writers, anyone else had to use the words, "like the great Giacomo Leopardi once said..." ? No? To think we were talking about oil as well...
2187 2018-02-19 19:28:14 It’s actually a European problem in origin in this case. The Mafia has been involved in tainted olive oil for decades. The real life Godfather made his money this way. Costco has organic olive oil that’s been vetted as 100%. It is $16 for 2 liters. But it is caveat emptor.
2188 2018-02-19 19:28:07 Ohh yeah my car has oil life so I let it tell me when I hit my mileage mark
2189 2018-02-19 19:28:00 Both have been correct in this game of immigration ping pong,  politicians take turns serving the cause of illegals. Citizens just observe
2190 2018-02-19 19:27:58 Coconut oil on your hair is ridiculous I don’t know how or why some of you do it
2191 2018-02-19 19:27:50 No. Just bullies. If "non-white" people have some kind of magic cloak of righteousness which makes it impossible for them to bully people you should bottle that snake oil and make the world a better place.  IF...
2192 2018-02-19 19:27:28 I said the same thing days ago. Oil of oregano is life altering in a good way.
2193 2018-02-19 19:27:27 I've mentioned  this  before-- one  sure  fire  proof of  collusion..  the  talk  Putin had  w/Trumpo  when he  entered  the  oval..  Mike  flynn  was a  direct  witness/participant  to their  talk  as  they  were  discussing  lifting  that  rosneft  oil drill.. Sally  Yates ..
2194 2018-02-19 19:27:21 That oil you could afford to extract after English investment?
2195 2018-02-19 19:27:07 Tech is truly the new oil.  Incumbents better get their A game on.
2196 2018-02-19 19:26:53 With out googling it, i imagine its engine oil of some type going by the packaging.
2197 2018-02-19 19:26:34 I love this wild growth oil
2198 2018-02-19 19:26:22 < someone like me, this is like striking oil. My phone has done its job, and leaving it in his car would raise suspicion. Therefore, reaching for the landline, I give Peter's number - the one he scribbled on my hand >
2199 2018-02-19 19:26:10 this one's oil paint filter brother, nice btw.
2200 2018-02-19 19:26:08 GUYYYYSSS i need a really good face oil!!!!!!!!!!!! cause my shit too dry soooo if u can recommend me a rlly good one i would rlly rlly rlly appreciate it
2201 2018-02-19 19:26:03 Big papi already has the bridge right, so does Pedro have anything? If it's pedro way they have to oil it down daily.
2202 2018-02-19 19:25:57 You can solve this problem by voting in 2018/202 for a common man who is, to start with, not bought and paid for by the NRA, Koch Brothers, and gas and oil lobbyists!
2203 2018-02-19 19:25:55 What I'm hearing over n over is big consulting companies pushing so-called "spotify model" to orgs across Europe, regardless of clients profile, business and culture. Leaving them wonder how to cross-breed tribes, guilds and chapters with current org charts. Snake oil sells.

2207 2018-02-19 19:25:11 If corn oil is made from corn and vegetable oil is made from vegetables i wonder what baby oil is made from?
2208 2018-02-19 19:25:05 2/2 those other teams that don't have loads of oil money to spend 200 million on defenders. If any other of the top 6 had the investment you lot have had they would be doing as much if not more with it
2209 2018-02-19 19:25:01 If you want chemical free version you can kill them with Teatree oil #TheArchers
2210 2018-02-19 19:25:01 If we no longer use oil for fuel, how much oil do we really need?
2211 2018-02-19 19:24:59 $90 for an oil change and $105 for wiper blades and a headlight...I think I’m going to start riding my horse everywhere #ihateadulting 
2212 2018-02-19 19:24:53 I actually had a dog off leash/lead go for me tonight. Shit me right up, had to slow and dodge. Plus nearly slipped on Fucking oil everywhere. Pikey town!
2213 2018-02-19 19:24:31 Coconut oil is the best!
2214 2018-02-19 19:24:27 Day 3 of taking CBD oil and I’m feeling pretty good. Too soon to tell if it’s a placebo effect or not yet.
2215 2018-02-19 19:24:23 except they never actually made those claims, and I'm still waiting on someone explaining why Norway make £3b/year from oil taxes, yet UK (according to GERS) makes £15million.

But that's a whole different conversation.
2216 2018-02-19 19:24:21 Gas and oil are obsolete
2217 2018-02-19 19:24:03 True. But how much is oil if it’s no longer used for fuel? $0.10 a barrel?
2218 2018-02-19 19:23:47 @RachelNotley you need to mind your own business and stay out of BC's. I sincerely hope the people of Alberta vote you out, you ruined their farming economy and their oil economy and are now trying to blame BC for your shortcomings as AB premier. Do Canada a favor and resign!
2219 2018-02-19 19:23:47 The liberal gov just gave millions for superpak innovation but none goes to help innovate Alberta, oil industry.Oil and gas fund this country,every province has benefited from Alberta tarsands and every province will lose without it!
2220 2018-02-19 19:23:27 There are Alternatives to that which don’t require oil.
2221 2018-02-19 19:23:19 Need some black African soap, African Shea butter, and Jamaican black Castrol oil
2222 2018-02-19 19:23:08 I was thinking the V.I., DR or Caymans
2223 2018-02-19 19:23:04 Russia has land rich in minerals and oil, has a normal economy for its own people, obviously not rich as the UK or USA because it has no habit of going to steal in multiple nations.

Your history is full of crimes.

Good luck pirate, bye.
2224 2018-02-19 19:22:41 Yeah don't see the Jets making any kind of major deal. A small add? Sure but not much else.
2225 2018-02-19 19:22:35 Miriam: what beer did you get?
Me: the Guns and Oil lager
Miriam: is that from Texas?
Me: ...you're asking me if a beer called "Guns and Oil" is from Texas?
2226 2018-02-19 19:22:32 The whole reason this election operation started in the fall of 2014 is bc in the early fall of 2014 the Saudis, at US behest, opened the taps crashing the price of oil and crippling the Russian economy in retaliation for incursion into Ukraine. Sanctions blocked the Exxon deal.
2227 2018-02-19 19:22:26 Lmao, that means you really need it, your spiritual life is dry needs more oil.
2228 2018-02-19 19:22:21 I need some oil
2229 2018-02-19 19:22:21 I'm all for stopping the use of oil, foreign or domestic as soon as humanly possible. What I am suggesting is instead of buy Alberta oil to drive Ontario's economy we transition to buying Alberta green energy (solar cells, batteries, etc) to drive out economy.
2230 2018-02-19 19:21:58 How about oil and gas exploration was obstructed how about the economy and jobs were obstructed how about the investigation into Hillary Clinton email server and her foundation was obstructed how about Benghazi investigation was obstructed how about conservative groups
2231 2018-02-19 19:21:56 Thanks girl!! I actually do the opposite. I water and moisturize then seal it with oil. Is the other way better for blonde hair?
2232 2018-02-19 19:21:39 I’m getting my oil changed and there is a kid in here maybe 2 or 3 and his hair is styled like Edward from twilight and I can’t stop laughing. 
2233 2018-02-19 19:21:28 oil prices are up
2234 2018-02-19 19:21:14 And so it begins, the smear job against Parkland survivors
2235 2018-02-19 19:20:59 And what exactly would that accomplish, other than the obvious economic impacts to Alberta and Canada? Should we continue or even increase our reliance on foreign oil?
2236 2018-02-19 19:20:59 Hey Dodger! I just tweeted at you, I did an oil painting of you! Not sure if you saw it yet. I hope you like it! :D
2237 2018-02-19 19:20:51 1/2 Are you aware that the pipeline is subverting BC's regulations & restrictions? The MSM is trying to sway opinion & notley gets oil money
2238 2018-02-19 19:20:49 We are well placed and blessed to utilise the gift of the sun for energy. We are living in a world where oil and gas are being depleted and therefore alternative source of energy is paramount. Govt and the business community should work together on this one.
2239 2018-02-19 19:20:49 Anybody got a good oil change spot?
2240 2018-02-19 19:20:48 Just plain old coconut oil? OwO
2241 2018-02-19 19:20:47 Big thanks to @MapleHolistics for the free bottle of sunflower oil. Using that in my homemade beard oil keeps the beard game strong.
2242 2018-02-19 19:20:46 uwa----------------------------n!!!!!
2243 2018-02-19 19:20:45 Oil life at 50%. Changes oil anyway.
2244 2018-02-19 19:20:42 I only mentioned New York, because he is from there. New Yorkers have dealt with his corruption longer, and know his game. No disrespect was meant for the rest of the country. 
It’s unfortunate, but Trump is using the treasury as his personal bank. And yes, it’s always about oil.
2245 2018-02-19 19:20:40 The most pessimistic economic forecasts didn’t support oil crashing from $110 to $10 in 2016 either. World events and disruptions happen all the time
2246 2018-02-19 19:20:37 Whale oil beef hooked (say it in an Irish accent)
2247 2018-02-19 19:20:17 @AdamSchiffCA Go peddle snake oil.
2248 2018-02-19 19:20:14 Laurence you have got to be shitting me. We have kids in their 20's who vote and can't cook--check oil levels in a car--change a flat tire--use a screwdriver. You want to give even younger ones the right to vote? Come on man, and don't give me the old enough for military bullshit
2249 2018-02-19 19:19:59 Exactly Same thing happened when Gaddafi Didn't want Lybia to sell Oil to The Us but His Citizens to Benefit and he was Murdered under the Impression of being a Dictator so we can See that the Quality of Education has declined to a Point where Mandarin is being made a second Lang

2252 2018-02-19 19:19:50 no prob! Didn't know that either, my friend's mom is a stomatologist and she's saying to better not try this too much :o but I've seen people whitening teeth with coconut oil - and it's safe and has a lot of vitamins!
2253 2018-02-19 19:19:49 All thanks to big oil.
2254 2018-02-19 19:19:41 New 123 MW combustion turbine has been running a lot since 2015, mining sector was in slump with one mine closed for several years now. Late 2017 & 2018 numbers will show more annual increases as Hebron oil platform came online last year and 2nd mine reopens. GHG targets hopeless
2255 2018-02-19 19:19:26 In the interest of public safety I have room for some if storage space becomes an issue.  Just not if they are California models.

2262 2018-02-19 19:19:00 I don't want to say that the 9/11 first responders have gotten too much praise...all I'm saying is that personally I have much more respect for the guys who got the oil markets back up and trading
2263 2018-02-19 19:18:56 Over the years both parties have said the same EXACT words condemning illegal immigration and reasons for it. 
Just never both at same time
2264 2018-02-19 19:18:54 Exxon could careless they just tell people what they want to hear. As of last year Exxon still had not paid Chad for the oil they took from them instead Rex told them they needed weapons. Don't know if they ever did get properly paid.
2265 2018-02-19 19:18:22 It had its moments. Anything about loafs and “wonder bread bag and olive oil” is 
2266 2018-02-19 19:18:11 Oil paints: Oh yeah I need chemicals to paint/clean with them! 

...off to Lowe's!
2267 2018-02-19 19:17:51 Fossil fuels' day is done. Time for big oil to join the carriage-makers and Beta tape makers and move on to the 21st century, Mr. Trudeau.  Everyone but you can see the writing on the wall.
2268 2018-02-19 19:17:48 I’ve also got one of those olbas oil things to shove up your nose  totes attractive x
2269 2018-02-19 19:17:42 But not going ahead with the pipeline doesn't affect the livelihoods of Albertans in the Oil and Gas industry? Seriously dude grow up! The pipeline will be mutually beneficial
2270 2018-02-19 19:17:31 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?

2273 2018-02-19 19:17:02 Sitting in the service dept waiting room right now, getting my Outback an oil change and state inspection. Haven't had to sleep in it yet, though. I'll see if they sell pillows here. :-)
2274 2018-02-19 19:17:00 Nicholson sure making it sound like Pete is safe (which has been the growing trend over tha past month - that Pete will still be Oil GM next Sept.).
2275 2018-02-19 19:16:55 Benefitial Supplements
Multivitamin / Greens

Vitamin D

Protein Powder

Fish Oil / Udos Oil

I would say these 4 supplements can benefit anyone. All of these can be attained from your diet but are most convenient by supplementation.

2277 2018-02-19 19:16:46 BC launches a formal challenge to Alberta's BC wine ban.
Trade Min Ralston: "Alberta’s actions threaten the livelihood of the families that have worked to build B.C.’s wine industry." 
But stopping pipeline, oil&gas projects doesn't hurt Alberta's & BC families?

2280 2018-02-19 19:16:36 Just learned George H. W. Bush's early oil company was called "Zapata Petroleum Corporation." *Someone* could make this stuff up, Robert Coover maybe, but not me.
2281 2018-02-19 19:16:34 The fact you are panicking over the word "dilbit" tells me exactly how little you know about pipelines, oil, and bitumen.
2282 2018-02-19 19:16:27 The specifics are they have a regime that took power in 2013 when glorious leader Chavez died. Their elections are not fair. They have food lines. They have an abundance of natural resources from oil and natural gas to gold and diamonds. Yet still they fail. Why is that so?
2283 2018-02-19 19:16:25 Aw, but where's the fun in trying to dodge hot burning oil that splatters over the side of the skillet lid you're using as a shield as the fat renders and the skin crisps up?
2284 2018-02-19 19:16:18 Owa tsebela kae ?o Nagana ke baby oil smell
2285 2018-02-19 19:16:02 no worries. they burn oil by design which everyone poo-pooh's, but the consumption isn't vastly greater than most other cars. as a plus, it's better to use cheap, clean oil since it burns more evenly than synthetic. you can change a shortblock for ~$1500, rebuild is about $4k+
2286 2018-02-19 19:15:59 Since babygirl has no school today nails toes facials and coconut oil treatments for hair. I love when we get extra  time to bond like this.  #mommysgirl #girlsday #nails #coconutoil #spaday
2287 2018-02-19 19:15:58 It is sad when Russia is your biggest fan. Since the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 Russia has caused more world turmoil. It was the beginning of dominance for oil.
2288 2018-02-19 19:15:55 exactly, why would you even consider oil of unknown provenance and unknown composition?
2289 2018-02-19 19:15:50 Let me know if you need assistance rubbing in the Sun oil. Jx
2290 2018-02-19 19:15:46 Combine 9 tsps chick peas with 2 cups celery. Sprinkle with Olive Oil. Drain. Serve over basmati rice.

2292 2018-02-19 19:15:29 I prolly misrecall which preserved seafood I struggled to find without soybean oil ( smoked oysters maybe)--apologies
2293 2018-02-19 19:15:23 The art installations don't have artists with billion dollar assets. I mean sure the majority be duped into believing that the oil industry suffers but it's baloney to me. They have billions in assets. The polluter pay business is hogwash with the Redwater decision. #Hypocrisy

2295 2018-02-19 19:15:16 They want the Arctic to melt. It opens up new plays for oil and gas exploration, and new shipping routes.

2298 2018-02-19 19:15:00 Canada has oil, but PM Teflon cannot get pipelines built.
2299 2018-02-19 19:14:59 @YogscastSjin Just watched the “Oil Barons” Ark video and have an idea for you for your poop troll.  Tame a phiomia(pig) and pack him full of stimberries.  Ben can ride it and you pick it up with an argy.  You can just fly over whoever logs on and rain poo down on them.  
2300 2018-02-19 19:14:55 Notable changes for NL are ~180 kT increase in power GHGs; and ~300 kT decrease in mining/oil/gas.

2303 2018-02-19 19:14:28 my dad is always checking the oil on my car and he didn’t close my hood properly so as I’m driving the shit flew open
2304 2018-02-19 19:14:02 "Financing the dems with the gold from concentration camps victims teeth"?! That's nonsense? Where are you getting that sensationalist claptrap from?

Meantime you know that GOP financiers the Koch brothers inherited their fortune due to their father's Nazi oil refinery.

2332 2018-02-19 19:09:51 Synthetic oil is expensive

2337 2018-02-19 19:08:20 I forgot that coconut oil is the best detangler
2338 2018-02-19 19:08:09 look. clearly black history month 2018 is meant to take ya back to the mother land and allow us to party with the ancestors while nourishing our souls with coconut oil and jollof rice. EYE and here for the entire blackness of it.
2339 2018-02-19 19:07:51 Better. Heap on sanctions and drive down oil prices.
2340 2018-02-19 19:07:17 There is risk with everything so yeah I think we’ll agree to disagree. In Canada we are a resource economy and it makes sense to maximize our well-being. Every Canadian benefits from oil $$
2341 2018-02-19 19:07:14 Yes, and I may be the only bull/bull  Nope, no change. Tesla will grow beyond anyone's imagination, and this will not be enough to prevent the next energy crisis. Oil, however, has a finite life.

2363 2018-02-19 19:05:02 Maybe stop giving Louisiana away to the oil & gas industries
2364 2018-02-19 19:05:01 Big things are happening here at Energy & Environmental Services. Join us as we develop new technologies, economical products, and new ideas to revolutionize the oil and gas industry. #oilandgas
2365 2018-02-19 19:04:49 Start walking then. U use oil and gas in your vehicles. Probably have the big rv and take holidays in far away places requiring a plane ride. What hypocrites. You'd rather use oil from dirty producing countries and put 10's of thousands of CANADIANS out of work.
2366 2018-02-19 19:04:18 Everyone when the cheese is runny and you put oil on top 
2367 2018-02-19 19:04:16 If someone wants to put the question to government how they can hope to meet GHG climate reduction targets and increase the oil sector to around 4 megatonnes per year that'd be great
2368 2018-02-19 19:03:51 This tweet paid for by polluters that want to keep us hooked on oil without any smart path toward more resilient communities
2369 2018-02-19 19:03:46  that also requires a little baby oil as well xxx
2370 2018-02-19 19:03:40 Really?! That's so interesting as I've never heard that. For my hair, I use an African hair-growth oil from the beauty supply that has a bunch of diff. oils including jojoba. I alternate between that and just some good ole organic olive oil.
2371 2018-02-19 19:03:11 The Nissan place in Jackson is lit. Popcorn and a coke while I wait to get my oil changed and tires rotated? Yes please & thnx.
2372 2018-02-19 19:03:03 I have to put oil and shit in my car and it wooont stop raining.
2373 2018-02-19 19:02:54 How about defending those working in the BC oil and gas industry, including thousands that will work on a pipeline ?
2374 2018-02-19 19:02:53 気分がぱっと切り替えられないので、ずっと一速で走ってるような感覚がありますねｗ
2375 2018-02-19 19:02:49 For me their values is blood oil+blood money. Did UK, France, ottomans,Spanish etc ever pay what they did to the indigeneous people of countries they invaded? Did they ever pay for robbery values,slavery? Germany paid for their genocide on Jews..
2376 2018-02-19 19:02:48 Caraway is a radical nutcase. Same category as  Al Green, Maxine Waters, Kieth Ellison.

2379 2018-02-19 19:02:36 So I'm going to get my oil changed, and I drive by a house that still has the three wise men on their lawn...it's February :-/
2380 2018-02-19 19:02:36 I know it's not Christmas but the manky weather outside justifies sprinkling orange, cinnamon and clove oil around for a bit of #hygge right.... alongside soft lighting and blankets obviously 
2381 2018-02-19 19:02:32 I'm not convinced the "olive oil" used in canned sardines is anywhere near 100% pure olive oil. The practice of cutting olive oil with industrial seed oils is quite commonplace.
2382 2018-02-19 19:02:26 Oil.
2383 2018-02-19 19:02:17 There she goes again. Canola oil being pressed af. Hahahaha. Why Canola oils are always on posts about Fifth Harmony members?  so "PETTY"
2384 2018-02-19 19:02:14 "Bitchumen" is sand laced with a tar like heavy oil. In order for it flow thru pipelines. it is diluted with benzene , a highly toxic carcinogen that vaporizes on release forming a toxic gas. There is no technology known that can mitigate a spill from this but hey who cares - BC
2385 2018-02-19 19:02:03 I waited 3 hours for Walmart to change my oil for them to call “Hale White” to the counter.

I’ve never been much of a letter writer but here I go
2386 2018-02-19 19:01:56 My great idea at 16 was to nationalize the oil industry to lower taxes on everyone else. 16 year old me was a socialist and deserved to be thrown out of helicopter. 
2387 2018-02-19 19:01:50 Today's essential oil of the day is Geranium. Here are some of its benefits.
2388 2018-02-19 19:01:45 I side issue - the UK was not short of natural resources. Coal fuelled the Empire and the UK has abundant natural gas and oil reserves as well as metals. The issue is more about environmental sacrifice.
2389 2018-02-19 19:01:39 Taking a nap. I rubbed sandalwood perfume oil all over my sheets and pillowcase.
2390 2018-02-19 19:01:39 I wanna try the lip oil. Any pigmented moisturizing formula automatically makes me curious.

2394 2018-02-19 19:01:30 girls will smoke, drink and stay in toxic relationships and then go to CVS to buy a $5 sheet mask and coconut oil and talk about self care
2395 2018-02-19 19:01:11 Lord Jesus, you are the essence of my existence. Without you I am nothing. Pour the oil of your love and grace upon me and let me continue to enjoy your peace that passes all understanding. Let me find peace in the midst of all the turmoils in this world and let me hide in you.
2396 2018-02-19 19:01:03 And a lot of oil and Snow 
2397 2018-02-19 19:01:01 Any rinky-dink snake oil outfit that would have aligned with DT at that time could have been characterized as “grassroots” so could definitely have been TP ... or other groups aligned or designed to align with Parscale’s operation.

2399 2018-02-19 19:00:44 On this day in 1955- An oil salesman who had not coached basketball in over 2 years was named the head basketball coach at Mississippi State. His name was Babe McCarthy and he went on to win 3 outright SEC Titles.
2400 2018-02-19 19:00:27 It looks lovely! And yes I know just how much oil

2406 2018-02-19 19:00:07 Did you know that some castor oils have been washed with hexane? Not St. Francis Castor Oil. It's organic & comes in a dark glass bottle.
2407 2018-02-19 19:00:00 Unlikely I'd sign unless I could see positive longer term picture.  Consider these: Phase-out programs for current Alberta oil and livestock/dairy production, phase-in programs for greener solar-wind electricity and plant-only agriculture.  Give our kids a chance.
2408 2018-02-19 18:59:57 걍 빡센 컨테츠에요  굳이 안해도 괜찮은  애라 못하는데 한번해봐야지~ 마인드가 안통합니다..
2409 2018-02-19 18:59:56 You mean this part: “Beware those who would mock the beliefs of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. What is the nature of the snake oil they really peddling? What self interest are they serving?”?
2410 2018-02-19 18:59:36 Started using this new coconut oil in my hair and my shit looks impeccable i be trying my best to take good care of my hair
2411 2018-02-19 18:59:36 NO FUCKING SHIT. I also understand that to get out of that mess, we still have to keep existing industry moving along. Don't assume that because I'm from Alberta that I am "all about big oil" - I'm not.
2412 2018-02-19 18:59:36 Yes .....they better add vitamins and minerals to the pods.

2416 2018-02-19 18:59:17 Lol he's trying lift Russian sanctions to get 500 billion in oil
2417 2018-02-19 18:59:14 Stein is heavily invested in oil and Russian company who sell oil. The only green Jill Stein cares about is what's going into her pocket she's a self-serving WHORE!
2418 2018-02-19 18:58:54 just like oil on my hands
2419 2018-02-19 18:58:22 Then he could take note of Irving's comment that it would not be limited to EE oil, but would accept imported oil if it made business sense.
2420 2018-02-19 18:58:20 I hope to make things stronger by spreading feminism and gender neutrality instead of exporting oil and Canadian technllogies. Oh, and I misspelled Ghandi which should go over really well.
2421 2018-02-19 18:58:19 Oh damn that's not good. Here's hoping the engine isn't wrecked, and you tear the person who did the oil change, a new one
2422 2018-02-19 18:58:15 I’m disgusted.  Democrats & the Fake News Media have organized this propaganda charade. What about the teenagers at that school that supported the 2nd amendment? This is sick folks. Dems & Fake News Media are using these kids like the Hitler Youth, for pure propaganda purposes.
2423 2018-02-19 18:58:12 I know exactly what you mean: Stop the War. Stop Big Oil. Stop the Republicans. Etc.

All scattered, no true direction. The kids these days don't want to get killed when it can be prevented/hindered. I can't argue that.
2424 2018-02-19 18:58:11 Ima shave my whole body and jump into some grapeseed oil?? Idk.

2430 2018-02-19 18:57:03 Milton was back at the train station, the next train was due. He was excited to check on the progress of Jerome’s oil painting, anxiously waiting for the train to arrive and pass. The steam trumpet blared, and the clanking racket drew near.
2431 2018-02-19 18:56:57 Money laundering. Russia can’t do business like normal nations - it’s a mafia state. Chief exports are oil & weapons. Not legal to sell.

2436 2018-02-19 18:56:13 Depends on the model - one model is nationalization: meaning the same thing that most countries do with their largest infrastructure and natural resources, such as oil, diamonds, or even railways -putting the asset (in this case, land) in the hands of the state.
2437 2018-02-19 18:56:12 I suppose people will have to work for the factories that make the robots....Or help program them or distribute them or maintain them..Someone need to oil and tune them up. When the automobile was invented people cried, "The sky is falling"...Well?

2450 2018-02-19 18:54:58 Wrecks Tillerson in this job is a travesty. We all knew that Exxon & Putin were working a deal to make shipping lanes out of our pristine Arctic after they let it melt - then drill it for oil once most of the wildlife had starved. And Rex got his little friendship medal for it.
2451 2018-02-19 18:54:43 Water is a bit... well, watery... Soaking in olive oil is so much nicer.
Or buy them fresh, grill them, and add just a little lemon and garlic to it. 
Flaming them in vodka is a cool option too 
2452 2018-02-19 18:54:40 So that leaves a very big question  why did they really  invade Iraq  ? All will be reveald  soon the real anser  well if you  all think it was gas and oil  you were all wrong it was for  ?  I' am going for a coffee  brake all will be reveald  later mark @RealAlexJones

2454 2018-02-19 18:54:32 It says Wastewater injection Wells not frack.
The higher pressures are problem
Wastewater disposal wells typically operate for longer durations and inject much more fluid than wells that are extracting oil through hydraulic fracturing.
2455 2018-02-19 18:54:27 got an oil change.. went fourty miles to find there is NO OIL IN MY CAR.. it’s overheated and i can’t go home okay

2463 2018-02-19 18:52:50 I have a question for you guys: why are you promoting the consumption of palm oil (which is in oreos), when there are orangutans and other animals who suffer because of it? Please answer.
2464 2018-02-19 18:52:42 Thats what you call a oil change
2465 2018-02-19 18:52:30 Do the same for chips and drink the oil. As most is retained in the chips
2466 2018-02-19 18:52:28 Of those remaining 80%+ are due to directed gang violence

Basically, if you are not in “the life” or interested in taking your own, you are pretty safe
2467 2018-02-19 18:52:21 You can shine leather shoes with a cloth and some vegetable oil.
2468 2018-02-19 18:52:17 Stop Canada`s $3.4 BILLION Annual Subsidy to Oil+Gas, as promised.
2469 2018-02-19 18:52:04 Your avocado oil makes my life complete. Thank you! I initially discovered it in spray form at a @Marshalls in Puerto Rico. Ever since then we buy the ginormous bottles at @Costco. I use it for all sorts of applications from baking to roasting to frying and more. THANK YOU! 
2470 2018-02-19 18:52:01 $80 for an oil change ??  

$180 for a new tire ?? 

Wow. Okay.

2472 2018-02-19 18:51:31 I can blend with oil pastels on paper no problem. Eyeshadow on my eyes, not so much. Well I can but it takes FOREVER and it doesn't turn out this well.
2473 2018-02-19 18:51:25 I use black castor oil and this wild growth oil fucking fire my hair has never been this long. Since you have finer hair I’d say to do oils at night and sleep on them till you wash your hair in the morning!
2474 2018-02-19 18:51:23 If anyone wants to whip up a nice plot for the little east coast petrostate that would be appreciated. Great timing consider Ball announced today he wants to double the offshore oil sector. Anywhere else that would be big news for Canadian and provincial climate policy
2475 2018-02-19 18:51:13 I think he also believes that because we don't meet their marches with armed force we wouldn't do so if they actually tried to infringe on our rights. 

Nick is very short-sighted and dull in the brain.
2476 2018-02-19 18:51:10 And  we bloody didn't take the gas and oil of them  to pay for the war how madness is that said president trump and I Agree  with trump the Americans should have taken gas and oil  of the Iraqis @RealAlexJones

2480 2018-02-19 18:50:46 I don’t believe in hell or heaven but I hope there is one for this gentleman (Niravji) and the oil is scalding hot . If the law catches up with him I hope the sentencing judge isn’t squeamish about life without parole (after a fair and quick trial ofcourse).

2486 2018-02-19 18:49:45 Also it's not just Tumeric in the paste. It's coconut oil black pepper Tumeric powder and water. I sometimes mix it with oats and add some nutmeg and cinnamon. It's good for inflammation which I have a lot of.

2498 2018-02-19 18:47:48 He truly hurt for the children and their family. I remember this. I cried like a baby. I was getting a oil change at Toyota dealership. The whole service dept. Was sooo quiet . Not a dry eye... Unlike this monster we have. What did he do? Had a party. SMDH!
2499 2018-02-19 18:47:46 No los acusó a ellos de delincuentes sino a quienes contrabandean gas oil. Está en el audio
2500 2018-02-19 18:47:22 Gonna look awesome with nodding donkey oil platforms and all that revenue! #maga #deregulate
2501 2018-02-19 18:46:35 Castor oil, apply it just after you take a shower / bath while your hair is still damp. Buy the one you would eat / drink available at most pharmacies try get a large container works out cheaper than buying small ones .

2503 2018-02-19 18:46:27 Pinochet is dead and the career opportunities with the Argentine junta ended 30 years ago. You could still ‘hunt’ some indigenous people of their land for Brazilian land owners though? 
2504 2018-02-19 18:46:24 i’m so loyal to the olive oil ecostyler i don’t even want to try the new ones
2505 2018-02-19 18:45:53 if you think you’re having a bad day, just think to urself.. i didn’t spill oil all over my face today but liv did
2506 2018-02-19 18:45:39 When was it here? It’s one of the few things I’m too young to remember.
2507 2018-02-19 18:45:33 I work in the oil field so when I get my cash up maybe I’ll join you one day we’ll meet up
2508 2018-02-19 18:45:12 Thanks :) and I don't think CBD oil is legal here

2513 2018-02-19 18:43:20 Sort of like the massive taxpayer dollars going into our oil sands?

2521 2018-02-19 18:42:18 Ugh dropped my car off at 940 for an oil change and they said a 40 minute wait 2 hours later still haven't heard from them
2522 2018-02-19 18:42:08 Idk understand why oil changes take forever. I should be in and out in less than 30 minutes

2524 2018-02-19 18:41:46 Had to have a friend take my wife's Festiva to the junkyard without her knowledge.  Leaked oil by the quart, hole in the floor by the accelerator, brakes gone.  She didn't talk to me for a week. She had not driven it in 3 years. She appreciated this tweet.
2525 2018-02-19 18:41:46 the oil on that damn pillar made me smell like lube for a week
2526 2018-02-19 18:41:41 Waiting on my oil change. Thinking of what to have for lunch

Listened to the guy give his gf a hard time, acting like she was crazy for ordering spinach, onion, tomatoes, peppers, & oil/vinegar on her sandwich. He followed that up by ordering a cheesesteak with only cucumbers & ketchup...really bro? #manchild
2532 2018-02-19 18:40:56 You love me ? Oil my scalp so I know it’s real .
2533 2018-02-19 18:40:55 Y'all remember that Omo advert in late 1990s where an old woman who sells smoked fish explains how oil stains her body, but omo helps to clean her apron?
2534 2018-02-19 18:40:52 Report card: Hubs: "Oh my god I could eat this until I pop". I'd say I did alright  Note: because we baked these and used cooking spray instead of deep frying in oil, these are SOMEWHAT healthy. Eat well my budding chefs! 
2535 2018-02-19 18:40:35 Honest debate is one of those things that sounds nostalgic and of a former time, but in reality it almost never really existed.

2537 2018-02-19 18:40:01 Solution to the NY oil & has “problem” causing (?) global warming: Raise the cost of oil & gas in NY by 50%! That should cut consumption! Because of “gouging”, the excess profits could be donated to Government for the Wall to protecting the USA? Might need legal protection!
2538 2018-02-19 18:39:49 BUT OLIVE OIL! RED CABBAGE! FISH SAUCE!

2540 2018-02-19 18:39:38 Been epileptic 30 years, taken cannabis even longer. Was on epilepsy drugs including dreaded epilim. Couldn't function on it and stopped. All that kid needs is CBD oil, doesn't get you high just helps. It's heartbreaking he legally can't have it. Bloody backwards country we are!

2544 2018-02-19 18:38:50 Lmao Adwoa at this point as soon as I see you norr I’m bathing you anointing oil and holy water smh
2545 2018-02-19 18:38:47 وهذا حصل قبل فترة في Oil ETFs التحليل الفني يشير أن السهم راح يرتفع ولكن سعر WTI كان بانخفاض، ربما هذا المثال شاذ ولكن يوصل الفكرة
2546 2018-02-19 18:38:38 nutritional values are calculated based off of everything that's included in the box. This is mostly due to the fact that we don't always specify exactly how much oil to use (it will say a glug or a splash) and so we wouldn't know exact values for the meal. -Annie
2547 2018-02-19 18:38:29 Oil is going to fall back to $10 in the next couple years. Tar sands will not be economically viable. What is Alberta doing to ensure it’s economic future?
2548 2018-02-19 18:38:23 I’d any day pick avocado/coconut oil to cook or olive oil for dressing...

2552 2018-02-19 18:38:02 Middle East is only a small part of the world that the USA has gone to war with/on/in.
Admittedly an important part politically, or oily.

I wonder how fast USA and others would pull out if oil ran dry or another super power source appeared overnight.

2557 2018-02-19 18:37:34 Don't be confused Blair, just showing you how refineries that supply the West Coast get some of their supply without involving Vancouver or the beautiful Pacific Coast with dirt oil risk.
2558 2018-02-19 18:37:24 #Höcke: Die Chinesen und die Amerikaner haben den Anschluss an den deutschen Verbrennungsmotor verpasst. Wenn die keine Autos bauen können, sollen sie doch Reis anbauen.
Hintergrund: Höcke hofft auf die Revolution, die ausbrechen soll, wenn es kein Erdöl mehr gibt (Peak Oil).
2559 2018-02-19 18:37:12 The West feared Gadaffi , they thought he was a real life Killmonger. Leader of an oil rich country with no IMF debt talking abt a single currency for Africa. Also had bad ass female bodyguards btw.
2560 2018-02-19 18:36:55 It's alright you still get the free gallon of oil in the burger, you'll never notice the difference 
2561 2018-02-19 18:36:54 Coconut oil as lube
2562 2018-02-19 18:36:48 like I moisturize every night (with a "SUPER MOISTURE" cream mind you) and I STILL wake up with dry flakes all over my face. It's ridiculous. Since this new oil, though, it hasn't been happening!!
2563 2018-02-19 18:36:42 Have you ever tried using 100% CBD oil. It has no THC so your not going to get high. It's helps with anxiety and stress and even minor pains and aches. You can buy it legally in all 50 states.
2564 2018-02-19 18:36:13 Or might I suggest sending it to the east of Canada where your dirty oil has apparently tons of support
2565 2018-02-19 18:35:55 I've always been super afraid to use any kind of oil on my face bc I am so acne prone, but this face oil is specifically for dry ppl with acne prone skin and so far so good!!
2566 2018-02-19 18:34:53 So sistur nk beli blush, stick eyeshadow apa tah tu nudestix ke apa, lip oil and clinique moisturiser hewhew
2567 2018-02-19 18:34:53 Aw man, @VaunEarl sent me a really thoughtful gift - a full beard-grooming kit. Shampoo and conditioner, beard oil, and a wooden comb! Thanks so much Vaun, that's exceedingly brilliant and lovely of you!
2568 2018-02-19 18:34:23 It is what it is. Gun control is snake oil. A sugar pill.
2569 2018-02-19 18:34:17 Not sure what OPEC+ wants but they understand the likely results of higher oil prices on the boys in the junior high locker room of US E&P.
2570 2018-02-19 18:34:13 I’m sitting at an oil change place and it’s right next to a McDonalds and it smells so bomb.
2571 2018-02-19 18:34:05 So I bought this diffuser and I got a sleep aid oil with it, y’all I took the best nap after having such a bad migraine yesterday and I slept so good at night. I recommend highly if u have trouble sleeping or breathing etc
2572 2018-02-19 18:33:43 Why risk the spill and clean up after?  Risk environmental damage for oil money.  I think we can agree to disagree on this one.
2573 2018-02-19 18:33:40 Viscously? Like, with an oil, or something?
2574 2018-02-19 18:33:26 Please China ,enough of your holidays, its time to come back pls,everywhere hard fr us ooo

2576 2018-02-19 18:33:08 CargoMetrics is a commodity fund raising money on bullshit claims.  Snake Oil salesmen have been around for millennia, I'm sorry that the fact people pay money for something indicates it's rigorous to you
2577 2018-02-19 18:33:06 You are beautiful on the inside and out , out of interest have you tried rosehip seed oil it has been amazing on my facial scarring
2578 2018-02-19 18:32:16 accidentally cut my finger only means i got to wear cute band aids. 
and not being able to open jars. 
or when i manage to open one, i splatter my face with its whole content. this time it's only black bean sichuan chili oil.
2579 2018-02-19 18:32:03 Damn y’all, all head ain’t gotta be the double hand twist pump for oil style. I need y’all to not rush through sex so much and slow down.
2580 2018-02-19 18:32:02 Heard my brother was almost in an accident on the oil rig. Man. Thank God, nothing happened to him. Scary things shouldn’t make you realize how much you love and respect someone but they do.  Sad about the other guy and I hope for his recovery.
2581 2018-02-19 18:31:58 This guy just asked his 13 year old girl what kind of oil change to get cause he didn’t know 
2582 2018-02-19 18:31:56 Plus it tastes great :) The balsamic vinegar and olive oil salad dressing I made with your garlic olive oil was delicious. Thanks again.
2583 2018-02-19 18:31:51 @badjokeminister @cjdemooi Someone threw a bottle of omega 3 pills at me today, luckily the injuries were only super fish oil.
2584 2018-02-19 18:31:45 Vosotros sabéis si la cadena Dial se puede oil pol la nochel? O deja de emitil?

2586 2018-02-19 18:31:39 Most of US Oil Infrastructure was built in 5 year crash program for WW2. (Venezuela, Houston, Pipelines, NJ Refineries.) We could easily push crash program for clean energy.
2587 2018-02-19 18:31:35 Really illiberal hegemony not isolationism from a candidate who promised to take oil as a spoils of war? We are supposed to be surprised. And that he has removed safeguards against civilian casualties. He said he'd do that. Naifs.
2588 2018-02-19 18:31:35 So called big business tycoon looting govt. banks and our govt. sleeping by pouring mustard oil in their nose, what a scientific process of doing fraud .
              " O MY GOD "
2589 2018-02-19 18:31:32 sugar scrubs are really nice, it scrubs away all the dead skin from your face and stuff. I usually make my own which is super easy
alternatively you can use salt but sugar is more popular
You just need sugar, olive/coconut oil/shea butter/avocado oil, and optionally essential oil
2590 2018-02-19 18:31:27 People so quickly forget jan 2016. That’s when fear of oversupply tanked oil to $10. Whole towns were shutting down in Alberta. Thankfully Middle East reduced production and Alberta has been recovering. Do you think the scare taught them anything? Like diversification? Nope

2595 2018-02-19 18:30:36 Do you currently stock #Castrol Oil in your workshop? Provide your customers with an outstanding service with a store of selective oils. If you would like to learn more or you’d like a copy of our brochure get in touch today.
2596 2018-02-19 18:30:33 Makes sense that an oil family who has profited off contaminating water sources would then buy up the remaining clean ones to make a profit off that as well.  Round and round the money and greed go...round and round and round
2597 2018-02-19 18:30:28 Random story of the day: When I was about 2 or 3 years old I once ate a handful of olives thinking they were grapes.

I've hated olives ever since.  Olive oil is king though.
2598 2018-02-19 18:30:25 I can't believe the home office is preventing the use of cannabis oil to stop a lad from having seizures. Morphine is used as a pain killer, I don't see the difference.
2599 2018-02-19 18:30:21 It is always amazing to see the disconnect between people who want us to consume more oil from the middle east and support Israel.  Solar PV and EV cars slash demand for fossil energy and thus slash oil prices and income to terrorist sponsoring nations.  #OsamaHatesMyVolt
2600 2018-02-19 18:30:20 OIL DIFF: 3.29 -> 3.47
2601 2018-02-19 18:30:12 There's nothing wrong with not being a parent. It's not for everyone. Some people don't even have a choice in the matter. Just how it is.

I forgot to rant about the military data mining and recruiting minors for their oil money wars! 
2602 2018-02-19 18:30:08 Wait.  You just happened to have oil of anointment in your knapsack?
2603 2018-02-19 18:29:48 It's your olive oil that is prayed for so it comes a anointing oil
2604 2018-02-19 18:29:24 My head is a square and I’m all out of olive oil Bad omens
2605 2018-02-19 18:29:12 The current fuel scarcity is a confirmation that all the redundant big heads at NNPC and DPR are just busy collecting allowances for local and overseas training, retraining, courses, seminars etc. on how to market the Nigerian crude oil, never to refine.
2606 2018-02-19 18:28:57 I'm mad at the world's greatest country leaders  to still allow war in Palestine. WATCH HOW QUICK YALL WOULD OF REACTED IF THERE WERE OIL ON THE TERRITORY THO
2607 2018-02-19 18:28:53 the guy changing my oil can change my oil any day
2608 2018-02-19 18:28:48 I guess Dragon*con is the one con where you can get away with carrying power tools while doused in baby oil and sawdust!
2609 2018-02-19 18:28:39 And the same people wonder "why anyone needs a gun."
2610 2018-02-19 18:28:15 Oil spills are notoriously cleanable.  Just throw money on them and it soaks right up.
2611 2018-02-19 18:27:50 About 8300 tight oil wells were completed in 2017, about 690 wells/month in the Permian, Bakken, Eagle Ford & Niobrara plays together.
2612 2018-02-19 18:27:41 You showed a video recently of how dangerous putting water on an oil (chip pan) fire is. Is this different because uf distance? Confused Sorry.
2613 2018-02-19 18:27:38 휘경이!
2614 2018-02-19 18:27:27 GOP knew if HRC was POTUS she would've brought down their good ol boys club full of treasonous bigots & racists backed by oil COs & Putin She told us in the debates w/Mr Tiny Hands cuffed by Putin!

2618 2018-02-19 18:27:10 why do you think Trump picked him for Secretary of State - he was the one who made the Exxon Mobil oil deal with Putin - that's what the sanctions are all about - wake up !
2619 2018-02-19 18:27:08 Rosses are red
Oil spots are slick
Nobody has a head
That's as big as ERIK!
2620 2018-02-19 18:27:04 i guess they don't deliver to an oil refinery protected by multi layer anti aircraft defenses
2621 2018-02-19 18:26:53 That's good in the wintertime to get your oil warmed up!
2622 2018-02-19 18:26:42 This makes a lot of sense. Rather switch to avocado/olive/coconut oil...
2623 2018-02-19 18:26:32 Trying this CBD + MCT oil tincture today to see if it benefits my focus at all today at work. It’s got till lunch then I’m hoppin on the edibles lmaooo

2628 2018-02-19 18:25:49 #Morriston_NPT PCSO Grey has been conducting enquiries regarding the theft of oil in the Craig Cefn Parc area. Please be vigilant and report suspicious activity. #Teamwork #JG
2629 2018-02-19 18:25:43 Renovables are getting more and more extended in the industry. The exemple of Total,  the oil company reference which created recently a new branche in wind energy.
2630 2018-02-19 18:25:35 An actual conversation I just had waiting to get my oil changed:

Random guy: You getting your oil changed too?

Me: Yeah. 

Random guy: Car maintenance is important. 

Me: Yep.

2634 2018-02-19 18:24:11 Military strategists even talk of water, not oil, as the potential trigger for 21st Century conflicts, while the United Nations has warned water scarcity could displace 700 million people by 2030.

2635 2018-02-19 18:23:56 Sometimes when Clarinets come back they are rather stiff and don't sound too good. You can resolve this by applying some oil, blowing hot air into it, taking it apart and try to get as much heat into it as possible. Hope this helps
2636 2018-02-19 18:23:54 Those two are oil and water. Apples and oranges. Ketchup and ice cream. Regardless, those two could never go together well at all. Dan is a family-friendly channel. Jack swears like a sailor all the frickin’ time.

2641 2018-02-19 18:22:52 In the oil and gas business. Community colleges do a very good job of training future mechanics, electricians and lease operators.

2643 2018-02-19 18:22:42 i haven’t tried vitamin C oil yet and i know it’s all the rave but vitamin E oil makes my skin so glowy and clear
2644 2018-02-19 18:22:37 MARCO ALVERA: The narrative has really shifted in the past 12 months and traditional oil companies are finally talking about gas and the future of energy.
2645 2018-02-19 18:22:13 I want to go on record today to state that, while I have no proof, I strongly believe that the decades-long smear campaign against Snake Oil has been funded by none other than Big Canola and Big Olive. Mark my words. Snake oil will be vindicated.
2646 2018-02-19 18:22:05 Israeli wants free oil and gas and water resources. US slaves trying their best to make it so. Iran is opposing that. Everyone else is just along for the ride. Now that Qatari gas will flow via the Iranian pipeline, that is also solved.
2647 2018-02-19 18:21:52 No room for my tongue in my cheek. My mouth is full of yummy soybean oil.
2648 2018-02-19 18:21:34 Yoh 

get Jamaican castor oil (coconut) or alt get Rosemary oil, olive oil & coconut oil and mix them together.. Apply twice or three times a week.. It'll grow....  Or you can just wait it out 
2649 2018-02-19 18:21:31 Outraged muppets are commonplace, the RAF has a good approach to dealing with these clowns. I heard a guy once filed a claim because the SAR crew got oil on his wife's expensive dress while rescuing them. In their usual style, the RAF agreed to pay if he'd pay for their fuel :D
2650 2018-02-19 18:21:23 I need to go get a oil change today
2651 2018-02-19 18:21:23 Yes, but those who have the most to gain, the oil companies, are in control now.
Did Tillerson really divest himself from Exxon?

2660 2018-02-19 18:20:11 Things are getting back to normal for us. I got laid off in late 2016 due to the oil downturn earlier in the year, but I managed to finally snag another job last April that's close to home. The kiddo is growing up too fast for me to keep up with too.
2661 2018-02-19 18:20:07 I'm going to write a "Final Destination" type script where someone has a bad night at the μπουζούκια and puts a curse on the μαγαζί and the singers keep dying. Our hero or heroine will ultimately reverse the curse using a combination of olive oil, lemons, and garlic.
2662 2018-02-19 18:20:06 Maybe Putin has dirt on Trump so Trump is careful not to cross him. Or maybe it’s the oil deal bet. Trump, Putin and Rex T.

2669 2018-02-19 18:19:08 Nope. Not about oil. It was about preventing the rise of a Soviet puppet regime in Iran.
2670 2018-02-19 18:19:03 Probably big oil is a huge donator, and probably they donate big to the NDP as well.
2671 2018-02-19 18:19:02 You just skipped over the entire country but OK. Trump is down about a billion $$$ and we’re on our way to oil independent, but hold those thoughts.

2681 2018-02-19 18:17:01 last night i mixed tea tree oil, coconut oil, and extra virgin olive oil, heated it up, and applied it to my hair and scalp over night and omg my hair is soooo soft rn.
2682 2018-02-19 18:16:44 It certainly seems that way. I have had some mostly civil discourse about things recently (on twitter, believe it or not), but I don't think I made a difference. They stopped responding. Face to face convos are better, but both sides are pretty entrenched.
2683 2018-02-19 18:16:43 I have yet to hear of any world crisis, let alone a local one regarding there not being enough oil...so why the

2688 2018-02-19 18:16:04 So I’m using CBD oil (aka hemp oil) as a natural remedy to get rid of anxiety and I’ve never tasted something so awful in my life. It’s like you just put a pile of weed in your mouth, but super slimy 
2689 2018-02-19 18:16:00 No wheat, no oil, no diary, no meat, no eggs, just salad and some boiled veg.

2695 2018-02-19 18:14:52 Heaven and earth knows that we are not one one nizooria is because I the oil the sokoto califate is taken from old Eastern rigion, they want only the oil but not the people , and  buhari the monster is busy  releasing bokoharam terrorist but IPOB is languishing in jail very sad.
2696 2018-02-19 18:14:41 Norway didn’t piss their oil revenues up the wall, they banked them so well that technically every Norwegian is a millionaire. That and they spend the interest on the people & future
2697 2018-02-19 18:14:34 Oh, sorry. Dunno. Maybe cos they're minted and don't know what to do with their oil money

2701 2018-02-19 18:14:12 I have the ordinary rosehip oil  but find that I don't like the scent very much. Don't mind paying a bit more for something a bit more luxe smelling 
2702 2018-02-19 18:14:11 This link contains nothing relating to company policy regarding palm oil and the destruction its production caused. How about taking responsibility for removing bakery products that contain it from your shelves. Also invest in staff training - no one in store had any answers

2708 2018-02-19 18:12:51 Coal isn't obsolete, it has provided us with cheap power (which our destructive speNDP want to make more expensive) and enjoys support from the @EPA and @POTUS, so I guess oil is also not obsolete.

And yes, opening for @george_clinton was everything we dreamed of hahah He absolutely burned the house down for 2+ hours. I need a fucking oil change after all that funk running thru my system. #TearTheRoofOffTheMF
2710 2018-02-19 18:12:44 rosehip oil is a good lightweight moisturiser for this weather but if you're looking for a new brand to try I highly recommend The Ordinary (they sell it too). there's a store in Liverpool Street.

2715 2018-02-19 18:12:11 Yes. I had an idea for both. Clear quartz for both. Black tourmaline for the protection oil. Citrine, rose quartz, as peridot for the other.
2716 2018-02-19 18:11:52 If Norway handed over sovereign oil wealth to .01% & also use fiat money to give more welfare to .01%  & give no safety net to 100% as in the USA then Norwegian people won't be the happiest in the world either
2717 2018-02-19 18:11:18 At home minding my own business when my son in law decided it would be a good idea to call and cuss me out for giving my Daughter some oil he had left at my house (along with a shit load of other stuff because he didn't have anywhere to store it) all that was missing was
2718 2018-02-19 18:11:16 Better use the resources we have than foreign oil that doesn't get produced to our strict standards!
2719 2018-02-19 18:10:55 That's even more BS. We all did this years ago!

The entire Carbon Tax proponent side ignores reality. The world is going to use every drop of Oil, every litre of Natural Gas and every ounce of Coal. The long term survivability of humankind depends upon finding a better renewable
2720 2018-02-19 18:10:45 Says RIN price & RFS will “fix” itself because the gap between blend wall and 15 BG continues to shrink every year. Missing how market will demand that much ethanol minus RFS when oil companies have clearly stated they won’t blend/need north of ~7 BG?!
2721 2018-02-19 18:10:37 The new generations at this point need to focus on nuclear power plants. They take less space and put out more energy. Media and oil people make people fear Nuclear power. Do your research on it. To bad  people fear.

2742 2018-02-19 18:07:13 A wok is best, and it's why you need a good glug of oil that's already hot. You crack it into the little oil puddle and stir it quickly as it looks then take it out before it gets rubbery. I copied the gals service street food in Thailand.

2758 2018-02-19 18:04:50 oh and gross mismanagement of its oil reserves and its state-owned oil company, which is bankrupt.

2766 2018-02-19 18:03:45 So I tried a new #bread recipe today trying to make a more rustic roll style bap. Just tried it & I have to say with an oil & olives it would taste sensational

2779 2018-02-19 18:01:33 My best wishes to your daddy. Do try ten almonds soaked overnight at breakfast, a sandwich or stir fried veges in coconut oil for lunch, a bit of #cannabis after sun down if legal in your area. All thise things might help in a few weeks

2782 2018-02-19 18:01:20 This is the poison in our democracy. We need people to see through the lies. Voters time and again keep voting for the snake oil salesman with the sweetest song feeding their personal bias and distorted views of the world. They truly keep voting the men carrying bibles and guns.

2790 2018-02-19 18:00:54 Ken Livingstone became an advisor to the Venezuelan government & did a deal to purchase their oil, while he was London mayor..
2791 2018-02-19 18:00:45 I am oil and gas business I need £10,000 to start my company.
2792 2018-02-19 18:00:32 I've worked all my life since I was 15 as a daycamp counselor. I'm now retired and depend on fuel assistance. I have spent all my savings over the past five years on oil. I know there are millions like me. GIVE A DAMN!
2793 2018-02-19 18:00:30 As CM of Gujarat, Mr. Modi had announced that GSPC had discovered oil and gas. But now when he is PM, ONGC is buying out GSPC. What is the reason for this, if GSPC was making profit with its discovery? #MaunModi
2794 2018-02-19 18:00:27 Perhaps we're looking at this all wrong. Why would Iceland build nuclear power stations when they have abundant geothermal power under their feet? Similarly, why would Saudi Arabia replace declining oil production with nuclear when they have huge deserts & abundant sunshine?
2795 2018-02-19 18:00:22 I’m going to make two films, both named “Drillin’ and Spillin’” one will be a documentary about the oil industry and the other will be a porno.

2799 2018-02-19 18:00:10 My cousin lives in a hollow tree out by ted’s place.  He says ted smell like old spice, baby oil and burritos.  Ted doesn’t like Mexicans but he likes their food.

2804 2018-02-19 17:59:34 Everybody need a oil change today. 
2805 2018-02-19 17:59:20 Because Russia wants Syria's oil fields.  Russia is becoming a *really big* troublemaker.
2806 2018-02-19 17:59:17 Could you please remember that oil trading is not everything? When I talk about global trade,  I am not talking about oil.
2807 2018-02-19 17:59:17 So far, been through four bottles of tea tree oil and a jar and a half of coconut oil, so to say the least, my skin has never been this soft. Itchy, flaky, but soft.
2808 2018-02-19 17:59:14 No, my assumption is Gresham's Law has held for millennia & will continue to do so.  Before US prints $100T+ to avoid insolvency as u (correctly) suggest it will, China & others will say "You take the UST's/USD's, we'll take the oil/copper/gold/etc."  They've been doing this.

2816 2018-02-19 17:57:38 I need to get an oil change and study but I’m cooling it today
2817 2018-02-19 17:57:30 When did oil and gas companies start calling themselves "energy companies"

2821 2018-02-19 17:56:58 Gotta get my car inspected, oil changed and find out WHY my tire pressure and check engine lights won’t turn off even if NOTHING IS WRONG.
2822 2018-02-19 17:56:54 I am with you and I live in AB. It is past time to decrease oil and get on board with renewables. We need to start lessening oil production and increasing green energy. Earth is past its limit. Politicians need to act NOW.
2823 2018-02-19 17:56:38 Getting an oil change!!
2824 2018-02-19 17:56:32 Ignorance is bliss,.. Remember to keep you eyes shut when you stick your head in the sand.. As for transfer payments.. I didn't see Alberta on the Recipient list.. No oil, no money..
2825 2018-02-19 17:56:20 I  call that a great fat #StrawMan. Venezuela is in the shit due to: 1/Colossal mismanagement/corruption; 2/Catastrophic waste of oil resources; 3/ Debt obligations in a currency which is not their own (as with Weimar, Zimbabwe & most other instances of hyperinflation)

2832 2018-02-19 17:55:32 You are clearly not the full shilling - my point was that if the UK authorities have not approved use via its testing protocols then the family have an uphill task - cannabis oil has not passed uk testing -  perhaps delete Common sense from your name
2833 2018-02-19 17:55:23 Shhhh coconut oil is an exception
2834 2018-02-19 17:55:20 Plastics are predominantly #oil derivatives. Need to accelerate the move to the #Bioeconomy and biodegradable plastics.
2835 2018-02-19 17:55:13 I want zero deficit too, but I find it  funny to mock the NDP about it because in 2008, when oil royalties were at a record high, our non-NDP government ran a deficit.
It’s not an NDP problem, it’s an oil revenue management problem and an Alberta problem.
2836 2018-02-19 17:55:09 Since 2002, we have provided the best service at the best prices . With over 600,000 truck services performed to date, we know a thing or two about changing oil. #gillexpress #truckrepair #truckwash
2837 2018-02-19 17:54:33 About 60%  will be suicides, and almost all will be handguns.  And there are ~ 300 million floating around.
2838 2018-02-19 17:54:22 How about we stop importing foreign oil into Canada as the first step and see how that works out for you? By leaving it in the ground, can we leave it in someone else's ground? How long would Ontario last before Energy East is back on the table? #cdnpoli
2839 2018-02-19 17:54:01 I left my car at the dealership for an oil change & ubered home and my moms husband told me rn “oh your home? I thought you were gone. Where’s your car? And I looked at him worried and said “what do you mean where’s my car? It’s not in the driveway!?” His face was priceless 
2840 2018-02-19 17:54:00 ฝันดีนะคะ @iam_Oil
2841 2018-02-19 17:53:54 I think you are referring to GLOBAL oil demand growth. This chart is U.S. 12-month avg compared to Jan 2015--very different volumes.
2842 2018-02-19 17:53:54 Well it was doing it so I change the oil and put a brand new oil filter on it and it's still doing it. I've also checked and double check the crankcase ventilation and it is working perfectly with a brand new valve cover so I don't understand
2843 2018-02-19 17:53:32 More than anything, they want LY’s oil.
2844 2018-02-19 17:53:23 I checked and double-checked crankcase ventilation and it is working perfectly just change the oil it has a brand new oil filter on it I am seriously at a loss
2845 2018-02-19 17:53:12 Tell me about it im literally half bald. Im never wearing braids again. Never ever ever everrrr again. Im using Jamaican black castor oil on my edges and scalp. Avocado oil. Cantu leave in and lotion anddd shea  gel to lock in moisture

2847 2018-02-19 17:52:41 So I have a business lunch scheduled with an old middle school math teacher. Why? Because he is now a vp of a oil and gas company. Small world. It's who you know.

2849 2018-02-19 17:52:18 Bastardised Pad Thai. Stir fry an egg in a tbsp of hot sunflower oil, remove it from the pan. Stir fry grated carrot, white cabbage, onion and whatever other veggies you have (broccoli, baby corn, peas, anything) w/some soy sauce, fish sauce, honey, garlic & ginger
2850 2018-02-19 17:52:11 If you put stark choices in front of people - big layoffs,  job cuts,  closed schools and hospitals - or more oil exploration and lots of oiled ducks and dead fish, kiss DOnald goodbye.  No one will look for Nemo.
2851 2018-02-19 17:52:09 Why in Europe does your French fries contain potatoes, oil and salt but in the U.S. there are ingredients that are hard to pronounce also thanks for keeping the yoga mat chemical additive in your buns, looking out for our health of course
2852 2018-02-19 17:52:08 Damn, hmm... you can make any vegetable/fruit tastier with butter/oil/sugar/salt/acid. So... I guess I'd take option one.
2853 2018-02-19 17:52:03 A2)  By putting small battle ball and if it gets chan chan sound then the oil is hot enough to fry #DesiChinese

2865 2018-02-19 17:50:46 They're owned by the oil companies because like all NL governments since oil started flowing they're addicted to the revenue stream and they buying the industry fear mongering about threats to that revenue stream
2866 2018-02-19 17:50:35 Did the same to mine. Are you still using the coconut oil? Ask for samples at Sephora..try ultra repair cream and the fresh rose hydrating cream. It could be the wash you’re using too.

2882 2018-02-19 17:48:38 I used to use coconut oil, carrot oil, black Jamaican castor oil, eggs, muesli and avocado.

2888 2018-02-19 17:47:34 I've not used Olbas oil in a long time bc my old singing teacher said it was bad for singers. Today I've used it again and I'm starting to be able to breathe again!
2889 2018-02-19 17:47:34 My grandfather did carpenters and loved oil treated and finished wood. You have to constant maintain and treat it; or things like that happens.
Runners and silicone absorb the oils; and cause rings; never mind the chemical reactions.
2890 2018-02-19 17:47:17 Yes but part of that federal process has potentially bad economic impacts here if it slows or halts development.  It's an alignment of interests not being owned by Big Oil, as you;d have it Will.  They should also oppose it for taking development control  contrary to AA 85.

2904 2018-02-19 17:46:11 The thought of dropping a live tarantula into a vat of hot oil and then eating it is horrifying tarantulas are precious creatures anyone who has forayed into the world of bug handler youtube would know that
2905 2018-02-19 17:46:06 These characters love body oil, never seen a character so oily in my life

2913 2018-02-19 17:45:09 This is Nazi style propaganda...
The 'Third world' is such because for decades the corrupt Western governments have been bleeding those poor countries/people dry of their resources.

2915 2018-02-19 17:44:16 I splashed hot oil on my hand the other day. Tribe fans, you know in season 2 when we get a glimpse back to the Virus, and Bray’s dad’s hands... yeah.
2916 2018-02-19 17:44:05 So what sent the most carbon into the atmosphere--Fort Mac oil operations or Fort Mac fire during that same time span?
2917 2018-02-19 17:44:05 The current price for Heating Oil is $2.249 per gallon.
2918 2018-02-19 17:44:02 @CMO_Gujarat Sir please do something to reduce pollution in Vadodara. Particularly city buses and rickshaws (by using kerosene and duplicate engine oil) are polluting the atmosphere which are bad for human beings.
2919 2018-02-19 17:44:00 @SkyNewsBreak Can't believe Alfie Dingley has been refused treatment of a cannabis based oil treatment which enhances his life, but are happy to prescribe drug addicts ?
2920 2018-02-19 17:43:58 When I eat samoosas, I can feel the oil running through my veins lol
2921 2018-02-19 17:43:57 ooh ty!! someone also recommended vitamin e oil, so I’ll def put rosehip oil on the list as well! (*´∀`)♪
2922 2018-02-19 17:43:32 Oh I understd it VERY well; in fact I'm counting on it.  US is insolvent, but cant go insolvent b/c it can print USD.  But if oil's only settled in USD's, what happens to real value of USD-denom savings of oil exporters & creditors like China as US prints to avoid insolvency?
2923 2018-02-19 17:43:22 good advice, oil paint for the first time it is
2924 2018-02-19 17:43:09 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
2925 2018-02-19 17:43:08 Me too. I didn't mean violent revolution. I meant a revolution of understanding. We have let snake oil salesmen control our perception of the natural order of things long enough. It is time again for the young to lead the way.
2926 2018-02-19 17:42:59 Mehn, Oil too much for this chow
2927 2018-02-19 17:42:54 2 comments (welcome other thesis)
1. Oil will be irrelevant in 10yrs
2. China is surely massively long current AND future $$$.
No??
2928 2018-02-19 17:42:47 I’d been looking around for an essential oil diffuser when contacted me and ruins my….

2930 2018-02-19 17:42:33 And Robert is correct, the Ball Libs would have a stronger position on oil and gas if they had credible climate policy. Unlike the Notley government or the Trudeau Libs they don't see the advantage in being strong on environment
2931 2018-02-19 17:42:32 Temi said: Pastor said anoint your children with oil, cool. My mother took my wig off to oil my scalp, in front of the congregation #okbye
2932 2018-02-19 17:42:28 Astonishingly powerful interview @skynews @KayBurley with Alfie Dingleys mum over clinical use of cannabis oil. If the health Secretary has any heart or a conscience he will act now.

2938 2018-02-19 17:41:18 Isn’t OBVIOUS WHY BIG PHARMA, WALL ST, BIG OIL, CROOKED SOROS support Democrats?
2939 2018-02-19 17:41:03 Israel served as a base camp for western oil wars as they paved the earth and stunk it up with cars. Only fitting their soldiers die in vehicle crash.
2940 2018-02-19 17:41:02 I didn’t know it existed until I started working at Sally’s, but it’s great! It’s called Color Fix buy One ‘n Only Argon Oil if you ever need it again!
2941 2018-02-19 17:40:59 @ShahidKhaqanABS Most countries of the world took advantage of the lowest energy prices. China the largest purchaser of the Oil & gas quickly changed suppliers started to buy American Oil & Gas to take advantage of the lower prices. Why PK did not act despite my dozens of tweets.

2944 2018-02-19 17:40:39 @MBrundleF1 New rule for 2018.
"5.1.12 All power unit breather fluids may only vent to atmosphere ..."
This means the practice of burning vented fluids has ended, which means more oil and coolant on the track and on the following car. That could be fun! Cover the enemy on demand.
2945 2018-02-19 17:40:37 Coconut oil is cool for your skin.. but there are so many better oils to use, for your hair especially. Research about different oils and their porosity levels.
2946 2018-02-19 17:40:37 That was my summer coconut oil tan once upon a time.
2947 2018-02-19 17:40:30 Si es así que la celda que ocupa Cristóbal López, la ocupe el juez y la que ocupa Fabian de  Souza, el fiscal. Para hacer justicia.

2953 2018-02-19 17:40:09 I use CBD oil every day and have a small stash of weed which I'll dip into once each month or so for a sneaky smoke when stuff gets rough. If I'm a criminal for doing that, then so be it.
2954 2018-02-19 17:39:40 I'm well aware of the various pressures that exist, and how policy is made, not naive about the complexity. The problem with NL oil and climate policies is one view point is dominant both in the political leadership and the industry.
2955 2018-02-19 17:39:29 I’d like to give Elena who works @ATT a big shout-out & THANK YOU for helping me get a cellphone booster so I’m not closed off from the world while I’m working in the oil & gas industry. What new cellphone should I get??? Sony Xperia XZ??? #MarcellusShale #UticaShale
2956 2018-02-19 17:39:29 "Democratic Party loyalists who see Putin, Maduro et al as the problem first need to answer for the candidate they put forward in 2016. Hillary Clinton led the carnage in Libya that murdered 30,000 – 50,000 innocents for Western oil and gas interests."

2960 2018-02-19 17:39:20 Ok, teachers are not allowed to pay for things you’d consider left wing because their salary comes from oil.
Are there certain books you dont want them to buy?
What movies are they can they pay for?
Will they be allowed to donate to left wing candidates?
Please advise.

2961 2018-02-19 17:39:20 I understand that is a global estimate.  The loss wld be distributed across provincial and federal governments and oil companies.  Possibly secobd order impact on GDP as well.  Think in terms of lost hospitals and funding that wld have been available to solve various problems.

2997 2018-02-19 17:34:01 Classic short-sighted Nimbyism. If the pipeline is blocked the demand for the oil it would have supplied will be filled by someone else from somewhere else. Do we know If this alternate supply would be better for the World environment ?

3008 2018-02-19 17:32:19 The truth is already clear - Russians helped Trump win the election in return for the easing of sanctions & & an oil deal. Trump didn’t hire Manafort, Flynn, Tillerson, & Page despite their ties to Russia but because of them.

3015 2018-02-19 17:31:41 Insecure much?? Prosperous Canada should include the Pipe Line.. Now that the transfer payment are slowing down from Alberta where is the money going to come from to buy all that off shore oil. Major fire in Ft. Mac. and Jr places a tax on import drywall that almost 2x the price.
3016 2018-02-19 17:31:32 I use it. Got it from a friend who wasn't pushy about it. I like it, but it is pricey. Haven't tried it on freshly dyed hair though, so not sure about that. The one I have has peppermint oil in it though which might be stripping for color.
3017 2018-02-19 17:31:28 Looks like you need an oil change to fix her up

3022 2018-02-19 17:30:49 I increased exercise, improved nutrition & supplemented with Omega 3 + Vitamin D. Reduced coffee + CBD oil to help sleep, but it seemed most off all, modafinil has worked in eliminating the effortfullness in taking action. It didn’t add motivation/energy, it removed resistance.

2. Limits on gun sales, in the wake of Parkland.
3. It, of course, does not stop the next whack job, who already has the gun. 
4. No defensive measures are there to stop it. 
5. Return to step 1.

3035 2018-02-19 17:29:11 Lots of orderly societies have non uniform coloured taxis. The requirement for yellow and black decals is more than sufficient. Tinting is necessary for passenger comfort and reduced oil consumption in this climate.
3036 2018-02-19 17:29:11  lol this guy tweets are Gold
3037 2018-02-19 17:29:02 Many past presidents have done even more harm then he has.. Can we talk about what the Bush administration did to our country? 911 and sent all our innocent soldiers to fight a war that he politically started over OIL.
3038 2018-02-19 17:28:59 So if people have a differing view to you they’re naive? have you thought about how the world perceives the United States?, did you ever stop to think that maybe YOU’RE the bad guys! Let’s face it 99% of the conflicts you start is for the control of oil... #fact
3039 2018-02-19 17:28:57 @AvonInsider please PLEASE make Topaze again. Especially the perfume oil. Pretty please?
3040 2018-02-19 17:28:53 The #BBC is #Evil d know very well that d #Buhari u see is an impostor bcos of #Oil d brought in #Jibril frm #Sudan to continue stealing #Nigerians r still sleeping @EU @realFFK @GovAyoFayose @Netanyahu @World @
3041 2018-02-19 17:28:47 It is these mismatches driving global monetary trends IMO: Global creditors (China, oil exporters esp) have realized post-08 that it's a bad idea to exchange finite production for currency/debt that must become effectively infinite in order to avoid insolvency of issuing nations.

3043 2018-02-19 17:28:36 THC is the psychoactive component that isn’t present in CBD oil. Not sure that THC is any use in treating seizures. Neighbours are exploring CBD for their child who suffers from fits.
3044 2018-02-19 17:28:35 Like train teachers if fire arm proficiency?
3045 2018-02-19 17:28:29 しかも布団に入って速攻で大イビキかいて寝たの腹立つ。私は怖くてドキドキが収まらなくて眠れなくなった。事情がわからない他の部屋の人はもっとずっと怖い気持ちかもしれない。
3046 2018-02-19 17:28:28 amazing, 500 dollars to fix my car and that doesn't count the oil or new wipers it needs, epic
3047 2018-02-19 17:28:27 Oil. Mineral oil, olive oil, baby oil. (I think)
3048 2018-02-19 17:28:18 So no @KFC_UKI @KFC_UKI_Help that's happy days!!!! With a bit of luck they will never get any chicken back its gone so bland and tasteless

Store in #Folkestone serves cold chicken dripping in oil
#DixyChicken is way nicer hmmmm
3049 2018-02-19 17:28:05 Well said!!! Arabian Kings can learn from Turkey! Soon your oil will end...I'm curious how you guys will survive. Look at history, arabs always killed their brothers, sisters,...
3050 2018-02-19 17:27:53 Rush Limbaugh made the same idiotic argument about the BP oil spill.
3051 2018-02-19 17:27:52 Yap, mum uses olive oil, dat’s sposed to be okay too
3052 2018-02-19 17:27:47 The price of oil has reduced a little 
3053 2018-02-19 17:27:22 i read in one forum that people were getting some (un clinically tested) results by taking small bits of their oil based finasterid injections and rub it on their scalp.
3054 2018-02-19 17:27:04 Definitely a step in the right direction. I only recently learnt that palm oil is not in itself bad (lower yielding crops requiring more land would take its place) and hope to see more transparency to help consumer choice 
3055 2018-02-19 17:27:04 A2: I do not only do wines but also spirits, such as grappa, ...and then extra virgine olive oil, truffles, balsamic vinegar...all from local farmers  #winemktmonday
3056 2018-02-19 17:26:51 I know but it needs another thing done and the dealerships take for ever just for the oil change lmao
3057 2018-02-19 17:26:47 How is oil “clean”? Invest in renewable energy now! We gotta get serious about climate change.
3058 2018-02-19 17:26:46 I agree with you Catherine and that is why the BC government wants to ensure the pipelines won’t harm our pristine environment here on the West Coast. There is absolutely no reason to rush this through except to please the Texas oil company.
3059 2018-02-19 17:26:36 There is a global supply and trade in liquified natural gas, and we would need far less LNG to fill the gaps than we currently ship in as crude oil or diesel to fuel our transport sector. At present we even use imported diesel to fuel OCGTs in SA. How absurd.
3060 2018-02-19 17:26:34 Sexy reasons ... 2:05.. y monedas o corren poco o la pista de maroñas tiene falta de agua y aplanar ... es caro el gas oil en Uruguay...
3061 2018-02-19 17:26:27 Come to the oil field
3062 2018-02-19 17:26:27 Work day for me, federal gov't... non dairy? Edible oil product? 
3063 2018-02-19 17:26:05 2018: Tide Pods are dangerous and we shouldn’t allow teens to have access to them. 

Also 2018: Let’s let teens spearhead a discussion on sweeping gun reform at the federal level.
3064 2018-02-19 17:25:57 All
3065 2018-02-19 17:25:50 I once used dish soap instead of olive oil...  bubbles everywhere!!
3066 2018-02-19 17:25:39 any artists out there that use oil/acrylic paintings as a medium have any advice for a beginner?
3067 2018-02-19 17:25:37 ... pjo q no estnos hablando de OIL o grupo Indalo...
3068 2018-02-19 17:25:37 Bih oil changes take like 10-15 minutes lol
3069 2018-02-19 17:25:33 Say Oil, Wheel, Beef, Cooked very fast
3070 2018-02-19 17:25:21 Imagine your flat mate accusing you of stabbing her oil, naaaa mate
3071 2018-02-19 17:25:17 Loving purposes not oil changing purposes.Change bro
3072 2018-02-19 17:25:12 "Tractors or Tiaras" would be a good album title. Like, a less successful follow-up to Diesel and Dust by Midnight Oil or something.
3073 2018-02-19 17:24:58 I was gonna go but I forgot my car needs an oil change and shit lol
3074 2018-02-19 17:24:55 I’m getting my oil changed and somehow me and the guy working the desk got on the topic of dogs and we have been exchanging pictures of our pups. 10/10 service will come back

3076 2018-02-19 17:24:50 Yo, " I will replace your heart valve with Valvoline oil. Cause nigga you think you slick." That's the funniest shit ever. I had to rewind that 3 time@THEKIDMERO #thebrandisstrong
3077 2018-02-19 17:24:50 When you go to get an oil change and they try to hit you with the “I’m gonna change the air filter and not tell you about it.” Just gotta cut em right off. Like nah dude. Just change the oil.
3078 2018-02-19 17:24:34 Just showered and massaged my body down in some coconut oil 
3079 2018-02-19 17:24:18 Change the oil ,get some Hall loumi !
3080 2018-02-19 17:23:59 There was no good way to do it.  I would've rather conventional peak oil ran on unabated and we rolled out distributed solar as emergency response but economies would've been pummeled and probably a die off/war.   Maybe methane release will prove worse idk..
3081 2018-02-19 17:23:45 Imma have to put oil in this mf again
3082 2018-02-19 17:23:39 Tea tree oil is the shit for new breakouts. You’re welcome

3086 2018-02-19 17:23:27 castor oil gaming too strong. please bring my lashes back! 
3087 2018-02-19 17:23:20 Exploit what resources? Just oil. There are many other countries that have laws about US companies which we don’t go to war with, you’re not making any sense!
3088 2018-02-19 17:23:06 @izfidel who r u
3089 2018-02-19 17:23:00 Doesn’t that necessitate a budget surplus first to put in the fund? At least in Norway, it was because the state didn’t know what to do with th oil money. Well, maybe better handling of mining sector will lead to such surplus. #SoNADebate
3090 2018-02-19 17:22:59 In the the waiting room for an oil change. A nearby 4-year-old is loudly complaining that there is no wi-fi #preschoolproblems
3091 2018-02-19 17:22:57 Oil money is blood money.
3092 2018-02-19 17:22:49 Today's Hero :- proudly declared today Me. Because my own preparation in hair oil,own use only. Coconut oil, karuveppilai, semparuththi, athimadhuram,nellikkai, karisalanganni. So super oil ready. Oh God save my head hair

3099 2018-02-19 17:22:23 Hunnigan, could you check and see if the BSAA has any units near the oil field?
3100 2018-02-19 17:22:20 To a regime removing regulations  for so many donor industries, dead kids, oil spills, mining disasters, poisoned drinking water, etc, are worth the money to be made.
3101 2018-02-19 17:21:46 And olive oíl. 
3102 2018-02-19 17:21:45 No, but mine are covered in coconut oil.

They're kinda squishy, tbh

3104 2018-02-19 17:21:15 I use a really small sauce pan with oil to deep fry things. Takes time but works
3105 2018-02-19 17:21:11 Bored out of my mind and sitting in the Garden Center at Walmart while I wait on my cars oil change and tire rotation ....there were no seats in the tire area so here I am
3106 2018-02-19 17:21:11 Tires, fender, oil change.. my car just a big ass child 
3107 2018-02-19 17:21:08 Finally took care of my lil baby. Got her a lil car wash cleaned inside and got her an oil change 
3108 2018-02-19 17:21:07 @FoxNews @ABC @GStephanopoulos or the other being out in no man's land I somehow figure things out differently than everybody else and it works out. The timing so far is on the money and we have oil coming in and out they could have slipped it out easily now Colin Powell
3109 2018-02-19 17:20:50 Got my hair braided and now I jus wana spray cold oil sheen on my hair all morning 
3110 2018-02-19 17:20:48 Right, but yankees are certified wackos. They - again- can take it as a "threat to their national interests" and start bombing oil fields. I wish Russians could place their military bases on Cuba and other LatAm countries to cool down the wackos heads.
3111 2018-02-19 17:20:40 Have you got one of those jugs that separates out oil and stock?
3112 2018-02-19 17:20:33 I really need to pay a visit to Sacramento  I miss my godmom, my sisters & New Lai wah  I have no excuse so now cus I got an oil change & my brakes should be getting fixed today so I need to go ASAP ... maybe Monday
3113 2018-02-19 17:20:26 This deal will annoy the Yanks as they started this proxy war to steal the oil and gas on the cheap. Well done to Russia and Syria on this partnership.
3114 2018-02-19 17:20:14 mmmm just made a hemp milk latte with cacao powder & brain octain oil ~

3122 2018-02-19 17:19:07 My hair is fully saturated in coconut oil and I look like a meth head. I’ve never been one to wake up cute
3123 2018-02-19 17:19:03 Just read a review on Ulta about someone hating the smell of Sun Bum tanning oil. I am shook rn. You don’t like the smell of the beach?!  also, don’t ask why I was reading a review about sunscreen on my lunch break 
3124 2018-02-19 17:18:59 Zuckerbitch is seriously looking at a presidential run. Quietly visiting oil rigs in Louisiana...no pictures allowed. Southern strategy?
3125 2018-02-19 17:18:51 Why is country music so depressing like I’m just trying to get an oil change
3126 2018-02-19 17:18:49 寒空の下20分もガチャガチャやったおかげで酔いは覚めていたので説教したところ「寒かったし」だの「起きてくれないかなーと思って」だの呆れる。菓子折り持って謝りにいくレベルだと伝えると「…そんなにうるさかったか」だと。うるさくなきゃ私は起きないし起こすためにうるさくしたのは自分だろ…
3127 2018-02-19 17:18:29 So China is massively short USD's, & soon China will have the ability to control the international trade value of the USD through oil/gold contracts?  This might be the most epic set-up I've seen in nearly 25 yrs in investing...mainly b/c virtually nobody else sees it.
3128 2018-02-19 17:18:08 like, brush your teeth with the chili oil, it's that good!  i mean it's simple... but, so so good... a workhorse of an oil.

okay, i'll stop now, sorry for spamming you all... i just get really excited about food ok....
3129 2018-02-19 17:18:06 Indeed they cost a lot, but over time the return is worth it. Not needing to pay for oil/coal power prod. The idiots in this video are just causing damage for no reason. Mildly infuriating.
3130 2018-02-19 17:18:03 Can’t tell with the rest of my head but wild growth oil I think gave the life back to my edges so far. They weren’t hurting but they were thinned out from wigs and braids
3131 2018-02-19 17:17:49 Wonder if he rubbed coconut oil on his privates
3132 2018-02-19 17:17:43 Oil from foods that have been digested enter into the lungs via the bloodstream and causes bad breath. #CharitableSmiles #Dental #Charity
3133 2018-02-19 17:17:22 also swatow chow mein is AMAZING.  crispy!  also, i'm a big fan of #8 beef tendon noodle soup and i get it with ho fun. i know, tendons.  omg.

speaking of omg, OMG also, get PUT THEIR HOT CHILI OIL ON EVERYTHING! so good. also you can buy a jar of their oil for like $6. SO GOOD!
3134 2018-02-19 17:17:11 You offered us Democratic Socialism, the "teenage" version of Communism.  Look at Venezuela after 18 years ... people scouring the countryside looking for rodents to eat ... oil rich and poor at the same time.  Trying to trick young people with free education will not work.
3135 2018-02-19 17:17:10 Randeep makes me feel bad about maintaining my hair!

3141 2018-02-19 17:16:46 alright I gotta sick up for a product made by my people *ACKCHYUALLYYYYYY* that's how it's pronounced. I'm going to go drown myself in palm oil fat spread now thanks
3142 2018-02-19 17:16:41 Americans is very violent society. And your Obsession with Russians, Islam, Oil, Bullying other Nations will make you have alot of college killings. That's what your Country teaches. Violence and more violence.
3143 2018-02-19 17:16:37 The boy David Hogg is FBI agents son, interesting!
3144 2018-02-19 17:16:21 Peppermint oil can help with that
3145 2018-02-19 17:16:14 Anyone else love the smell of bio oil
3146 2018-02-19 17:16:14 Trump rolled back mental background cks on everyone. I told you they tried to pass bill after SH & McConnell & 13 other GOP filibustered to keep it from passing. It's not a government for ppl by ppl anymore. NRA, big Pharm, oil, chemical & insurance companies decide the laws.
3147 2018-02-19 17:16:13 That was worth the 8 years  "waiting to find the oil"  G-D I love Israel 
3148 2018-02-19 17:16:05 Ms. Notley has a lot riding on the pipeline. Previous AB governments have squandered the wealth created by oil and instead of diversifying their industries. They are now forced to go for the quick $ offered by foreign companies. Sadly, they will hurt their own neighbours by this.
3149 2018-02-19 17:15:46 Happy birthday Reema. My go to in the oil industry. Many blessings!
3150 2018-02-19 17:15:44 Deforestation and finite quantity of water and oil are as big a deal as climate change. My man David Ruffin died a rough death.

3155 2018-02-19 17:14:58 And check for palm oil. They are killing orangutans through deforestation. Which sounds less horrific than burning them alive.
3156 2018-02-19 17:14:49 @FoxNews @ABC @GStephanopoulos barrels of oil is owed to him from Kuwait they refuse to pay. So during his invasion he takes cankers with him with the chemical weapons period on his return these tankers are filled with oil. So the chemical weapons are smuggled in and the UN is
3157 2018-02-19 17:14:44 no flippy, no oil. bad

also only true egg is fried on butter not oil
3158 2018-02-19 17:14:24 I use the oil too as u can't have garlic or onion 
3159 2018-02-19 17:14:21 Brilliant. The ONLY candidate in Nov 2016 who would not let corporations wreck our water, and you join the corporate Dem smear against her. You make the Pentagon war profiteers and gas and oil corporations so very happy! "Useful idiot" is apt.
3160 2018-02-19 17:14:05 Confirmation for $USD bottom comes when it closes above 92.64. Until than keep both options open . And never trade on basis of co-relations as they are only good 70% of times, infrequently. OIL and GOLD both are priced in $USD therefore has inverse relationship most times .
3161 2018-02-19 17:13:51 @DeborahMeaden Don't you think a barcode app for phones would be the way forward for consumers to scan items to discover if Palm Oil is part of ingredients. This is available in Australia/NZ only. #POIbarcodescanner
3162 2018-02-19 17:13:49 Try making chocolate homemade with 100% organic maple syrup (no sugar or water added), unrefined coconut oil and cocoa powder. Put them all in a pot together on the lowest setting (don’t let it boil once) & whip it together. Then put it on a paper plate and put it in the freezer!
3163 2018-02-19 17:13:40 Indeed. It was #Tillerson who spread false info - no connection between oil and #climatechange - via his #WayneTracker alias.
3164 2018-02-19 17:13:36 Went into target for some beard oil, then $60 happened...

3171 2018-02-19 17:13:05 Used to be in hardcore peak oil camp and thought we be off senecas cliff right now.  Fracking and tech gave a reprieve and now wind/solar can give next reprieve.  I'm no technooptimist but damping unmitigated disaster with tech is nice.

3174 2018-02-19 17:12:50 I need some chi oil !!!
3175 2018-02-19 17:12:44 Unsurprising, quite plausible most of the punters haven't seen what an actual barrel of oil looks like, but dabble in paper &  digital barrels all day long #OOTT
3176 2018-02-19 17:12:26 Your clubs very little success is plastic + hollow x Without the oil being found under the middle East you'd still be in division 3 like in 99 when we won the treble

3179 2018-02-19 17:12:18 Inspired by @Blumaan, I've started mixing hair products to see what they do.

It looks like a little hair oil and Hanz de Fuko's Quicksand add up to insane hold and a fair bit of shine - is this a cheat code for easy, non-greasy pomp?
3180 2018-02-19 17:12:13 Those tankers are almost all carrying crude oil, not DILBIT, which is far more toxic, dangerous and impossible to clean up

Lying by omission is still lying
Didn't your parents teach you that?

3182 2018-02-19 17:11:20 People? I thought they are just some oil tanks 
3183 2018-02-19 17:10:55 effective talaga castor oil for the lashes pero can't say much abt the brows wala pa talagang major diff for me
3184 2018-02-19 17:10:55 No one is buying your snake oil this morning, Grover.  Sorry.
3185 2018-02-19 17:10:52 The oil sector has collapsed, not because of oil prices, but cos we have failed to implement policies that wld stabilize the industry, look at how much of our gas reserves are still being wasted via flaring. . .
3186 2018-02-19 17:10:50 It was nice gear. It has a feel of oil when brushing it. Not convinced with coverage. It is quite brush marky. You can feel it too by passing your hand over it. I guess all waterbased are like that from all the different ones I've tried. Have you used it Lee?
3187 2018-02-19 17:10:49 I found a shampoo that’s coconut oil and milk and it is AMAZING. My hair is so curly and silky
3188 2018-02-19 17:10:37 J'aime une vidéo @YouTube : "MAXILIME & CO LIQUID SLIME EDITION !! OIL - FLUO - METALLIC & PHOSPHORESCENT" à l'adresse
3189 2018-02-19 17:10:26 If you can't butter them up, try olive oil.
3190 2018-02-19 17:10:24 I grew up in Aberdeen when the oil was at a boom, you went to uni you got of ended up in an oil company just having a degree. I think  after trial and error schools should empathise future prospects after higher learning.
3191 2018-02-19 17:10:16 知ってる？大学って大して重要じゃないんだよ。焦ってる暇あったら油、飲も？
3192 2018-02-19 17:10:13 My wife makes them! It’s my favorite way to have potatoes. She coats them in olive oil and seasons them with salt and pepper, bake at 400 degrees for 30 mins then smash with a spatula and back in oven for additional 15 mins.
3193 2018-02-19 17:10:10 I think it's leaking oil. 기름이 새는 것 같아요.
3194 2018-02-19 17:10:09 Nak tanya. Tengok ing biore cleasing oil ada mineral oil . Ada baca thread patut elak kan . Ada plk baca yang biore cleasing oil ni ok. Apa pendapat kak iman & kak lily.@ImanAbdulRahim @lilyzahani

3198 2018-02-19 17:09:01 You asked since when have T-Bills been dollars.  I respond with one example (Saudi's accept them as currency in exchange for oil)  Everything to do with it!!
3199 2018-02-19 17:08:53 Vitamin E oil has been a blessing for my skin
3200 2018-02-19 17:08:48 Meanwhile Canada’s govt continues to push oil and gas while doing nothing to promote alternative clean energy.
3201 2018-02-19 17:08:26 If any proof were needed that, on occasion, the law is an ass then this is a prime example. The benefits of cannabis oil for use in various medical conditions is proven and well documented. Failure to do the sensible thing here is pure dogma! Get up to date!

3204 2018-02-19 17:08:15 You could go into the subbasement of Hell, drill down to oil rig depths, and still find enough democrats to hold a fundraiser. You really could.
3205 2018-02-19 17:07:57 I think the really sketchy ideas Bush had for going to war make sense when you consider oil and his business background. With Obama he may have tried to stabilize things to keep prices from shooting up, but can you blame him? But I do believe Syria was a crisis
3206 2018-02-19 17:07:51 Surely they can turn all that ranch land in Alberta into unicorn farms.  And all those pesky oil wells can start producing honey.... 
3207 2018-02-19 17:07:45 I just said last night how Baby never licks me & she just did but I think it’s bc I use coconut oil for moisturizer & she loves coconut oil but whatever she still kissed me  #furmama
3208 2018-02-19 17:07:39 What's nasty about oil? They got lucky to discover oil in their country yes, but why is that enethical?
3209 2018-02-19 17:07:28 oh, i’m done after this. i usually get my oil changed here too bc this is where i bought it brand new. but not after this!
3210 2018-02-19 17:07:26 ...What the hell does him smoking have to do with the price of oil! If you had to deal with this country, I'm sure you'd be on something!! Who wouldn't want some kind of stress-reliever? What's your drug of choice??!! The thing is that he stopped!!
3211 2018-02-19 17:07:19 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.
3212 2018-02-19 17:07:14 I am a robot. I piss oil
3213 2018-02-19 17:07:10 Best coordinated global growth in a decade and oil only at $65 & Russian GDP only at 1.5%? With shale production continuing to rise and global slowdown inevitable, he wont be feeling so confident in 2 yrs.

3216 2018-02-19 17:06:53 The least you could do for all those federal oil and gas subsidies that the rest of Canada contributes to AB. Considering that the risk of catastrophic wildfires is greatly exacerbated by your greedy plundering of fossil fuels... I'd say you owe us a lot more. #keepitintheground
3217 2018-02-19 17:06:20 oil. on eggs? what? why cool? how does oil cool it? i have so many questions
3218 2018-02-19 17:05:56 #Activist Alain Didah from #Iyina was arrested this morning. He is detained at the #Ndjamena Commissariat Central. Why? He was allegedly seen near an old tire, holding a bottle of oil. The Police believe he was about to burn the tire. My advice: Avoid tires and bottle in #Chad
3219 2018-02-19 17:05:40 I just took some black seed oil for this sinuses congestion and possibly a cold ..its nasty af BUT it works & it’s natural!!
3220 2018-02-19 17:05:16 big oil big pharma have convinced us we are no more than cattle.
3221 2018-02-19 17:05:14 olive oil massages are good for your yoni.
3222 2018-02-19 17:05:14 You eat the bread, shot the olive oil, then lick the balsamic vinegar off the floor of the bunker
3223 2018-02-19 17:04:56 Without sanctions,both Rexxon and Trump get a big piece of a Russian/Exxon $500 billion dollar oil deal. Need anymore reasons why they're so against sanctions?

3229 2018-02-19 17:04:35 That kid shooter was a lost soul. Didn't matter what era. So stop blaming Obama. Trump is not a president. He doesn't know how to do anything but bluster. He's like the old snake oil salesmen. He talks a good one but can't full fill.

3234 2018-02-19 17:03:55 I’ve been working since 830 officially and there’s still no work loaded for me. So what am I doing? Looking at our site for discounts. Looked up emissions testing. Oil change prices. Stuff I could be productively doing other than what I’m doing

3238 2018-02-19 17:02:43 i was cooking bacon and the oil came out of the frying pan onto the hob and went on fire, it's a talent
3239 2018-02-19 17:02:37 Still not sure where the carbon goes? I think depleted oil fields is the idea.
3240 2018-02-19 17:02:31 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*
3241 2018-02-19 17:02:17 Time to get the oil changed in my car...
3242 2018-02-19 17:02:16 Don’t worry, the layoffs at Fake News @CNN have already started. It won’t be long until they’re either bought out or go belly up. People realize the phony crap they’re peddling is nothing but BS.

3263 2018-02-19 17:00:16 This was an olive oil butter that the #LandOLakes company gave me to create a recipe. But gen esp for biryani & pilaf I use a mix of olive oil, sea salt & ghee which is clarified butter! It's such a good combo 
3264 2018-02-19 17:00:08 You probably remember your oil changes, but don't forget about your filters! Dirty filters can increase your fuel usage by as much as 10%.

3267 2018-02-19 16:59:49 If I had a chain of Gas Stations I’d be investing towards converting them to solar powered E-vehicle charging stations.

Oil still ideally serves other needs better than alternatives; preserve what is left for those needs
3268 2018-02-19 16:59:47 I don't know if that was Jonathan's failure to save or due to the cost of crude oil.

3273 2018-02-19 16:59:07 I hope this oil change don’t drag
3274 2018-02-19 16:58:57 Brands best argument should have been that good democratic and cultural values have been upended by the West's involvement. Drones, Coups, Illegal invasions and Big Oil interests are the motherlode of bad policy that gives rise to theocratic power.
3275 2018-02-19 16:58:44 And yet efforts to help us get off our addiction to oil are fought from all sides, and we continue to build more and wider freeways and gobs more parking, as though we are still in the 1950s.

3278 2018-02-19 16:58:42 The economic argument won't work on the Green ideologues, nor will the fact of no B.C. costal oil spills in history (trains, trucks and barges are the culprits). They hate oil on principle, and think terminating a million Albertan resource jobs (people) is reasonbto celebrate.

3284 2018-02-19 16:57:17 Average car sold is $35k Canadian. So if they can afford a 35k gas car, they can certainly afford a $29k electric that requires no gas, oil changes or maintenance

3289 2018-02-19 16:55:59 Always use a butter, olive oil and salt combo
3290 2018-02-19 16:55:42 But I don’t think Russia is in Vzla or ME producing countries for ROI. If you want to extend oil use as long as possible and have aspirations of being a global power, you buy low in troubled jurisdictions with rich assets.

3305 2018-02-19 16:53:41 We understand your concern. Our team quotes between 1– 1.5 hours for all of our oil changes and tire rotations (even when we are not busy) this accounts for getting the vehicle back to the shop,

3313 2018-02-19 16:52:16 The FDA only requires 5% of actual cold or steamed pressed oil into each bottle. You should be able to ingest the oil. There are some exclusions. Frankincense is NOT $14. You are paying 95% fillers if that’s how much yours cost

3316 2018-02-19 16:51:00 タイツなのが良い～～～～～！！
3317 2018-02-19 16:50:53 Any country that refuses to recognize Jerusalem as the eternal and indivisible capital of Israel will face oil embargo from the Rep of Biafra
3318 2018-02-19 16:50:42 シコい
3319 2018-02-19 16:50:35 How much natural gas, and oil does Israel have?

3321 2018-02-19 16:50:28 I use what I like to call Gods Pharmacy. Just make sure you purchase real essential oil; YL, Doterra(I’m not a sales lady), just don’t buy store bought or on amazon. Little FYI: all the store oils you see that say:therapeutic grade or 100% essential oil-all propaganda
3322 2018-02-19 16:50:15 鍵忘れたからってこんな深夜に20分もドアガチャガチャドンドンしまくる夫に恐怖心しかわかない。酔っぱらいとはいえ怖すぎる。それぐらい騒がなきゃ寝てる私は起こせなかっただろうが、間違いなく全戸起こして同じ恐怖感じさせてたわ…ありえん…
3323 2018-02-19 16:50:09 notion: baby oil is the only oil where the first word is not an ingredient list but instructions for what you put it on
3324 2018-02-19 16:50:04 Lexi thought $99 oil change was a deal. I just saved her $50
3325 2018-02-19 16:49:50 So does the 10% to Ag Dept go to food stamps or subsidies to millionaire farmers? 10% to energy dept to renewables or oil industry? 10% to Justice Dept to busting pot users or civil rights? 10% to state dept to CIA or foreign aid?

Only real control is democratic reform.
3326 2018-02-19 16:49:37 To the people who support solar as being our source of energy and not using oil or has or coal.....here's why! You'd have idiot's who could take out the electrical grid easily.....hope you're mad at watching this....

3330 2018-02-19 16:48:50 You're right, add big pharma, gas & oil
3331 2018-02-19 16:48:23 The Economist thought that Bush Jr was an inverted intellect & championed the invasion of Iraq. Bring democracy by bomb & bullet. So, kids minding there own business vs the religion of war, to slaughter & destroy which will bring peace via oil investment portfolio.
3332 2018-02-19 16:48:07 Try using witch hazel and Vitamin E or Tea tree oil and use African Black soap
3333 2018-02-19 16:47:42 Except that none of those reasons actually make someone a leftist.  Unless being a conservative means that you have to be ignorant...and that's insulting to conservatives who happen to educated and have an actual worldview that includes the world.
3334 2018-02-19 16:47:32 This materal to everything in society and obviously business-wise. Its shift, to me, inspite of what the articles says, is further out front. Its not going to be like the oil lines of the early 70's, but in that we find other sources i.e. natural gas.
3335 2018-02-19 16:47:21 Things I've learned recently: rubbing dish soap into an oil stain actually makes it come out and the creators of Adidas and Puma are actually brothers who couldn't agree on making one brand 
3336 2018-02-19 16:47:13 Gee whiz! Forgot that I delivered my BC marine oil spill threat PPP at @BamfieldMSC as well, One of my favourite places to study, stay and lecture at, anywhere in the world. That makes a baker's dozen of presentations on that topic in the past 15 years.
3337 2018-02-19 16:46:40 Currently pooping then gonna shower then change my oil
3338 2018-02-19 16:46:39 Like cooking olive oil? Lol
3339 2018-02-19 16:46:36 Can i stop getting oil burnsss 
3340 2018-02-19 16:46:34 Try putting the oil on after the leave-in and the moisturizer. It should go longer without drying out
3341 2018-02-19 16:46:02 Reason eleventy I am an advocate of LOL Twitter.
3342 2018-02-19 16:45:40 I used to cringe when I would hear that moms gave their kids castor oil when they were sick. When I was sick my mom used to give me "higuereta con miel." Two days ago I found out higuereta is castor oil in English. I am a fraud.
3343 2018-02-19 16:45:31 Oil is currently dominant as an energy source, but natural will or may become more a factor such to impact the overall energy picture. Both domestically and more importantly internationally.
3344 2018-02-19 16:45:24 Lockheed Martin spends millions each year lobbying the US congress to oil the military machine with more funding.
3345 2018-02-19 16:45:22 One of the best things about using this hemp oil as a wood sealant? It's food grade so I can use it on my wooden cutting boards! #doubleduty
3346 2018-02-19 16:45:01 I feel so fly when I've taken the time to oil my entire body lol. Like I did something extraordinary that day
3347 2018-02-19 16:44:54 you pakai simple cleansing oil tu okay tak? recommended or prefer brand lain?
3348 2018-02-19 16:44:52 He is taking my car for new brakes today. Changed my oil last week. So my baby and I are safe driving.
3349 2018-02-19 16:44:44 Why are they paying 90 a barrel for some of their oil when the current market price [WTI] is 61 a barrel?? [Oooops, is the "Jones Act" tacking on $30 a barrel?]
3350 2018-02-19 16:44:32 Is it acceptable to fall asleep while I wait for my oil change 
3351 2018-02-19 16:44:26 Where are we supposed to get our oil from?
3352 2018-02-19 16:44:22 Oil change then nailery I need my eyelash fixed!
3353 2018-02-19 16:44:16 Oh yes I forgot about the magic shield which protects "WOC" (not even POC!) from falling prey to toxic biases but somehow doesn't protect them from the toxic biases of others. You should bottle that snake oil.
3354 2018-02-19 16:44:13 Gotta hit that oil change too ooooo
3355 2018-02-19 16:44:01 Poor service from @HomefuelsDirect. Text received stating delivery between 8-12pm 16/02 even giving tanker reg no. Still no oil 19/02 and no contact to say a delay. Now saying 20/02 after having to call them twice  after they promised to call back and didn’t.
3356 2018-02-19 16:43:52 Creo que es porque es vegetable oil pero no se jajaja yo la uso y es básicamente lo mismo en sabor

3358 2018-02-19 16:43:40 I need to schedule an oil change asap.
3359 2018-02-19 16:43:38 This country planned to form an African Union Bank, with gold Dinar as reserve currency & dump US$. When they refused to accept US$ for oil, their country was destroyed. One of many recent crimes against humanity

3365 2018-02-19 16:43:02 Should we withhold asphalt for paving your roads? You know that birds and gophers and Bambi and nice butterflies line up to be road kill every morning on your highways....

And why just oil tankers? Will you stop ferries? Fishing boats? Tug boats? Cruise ships?

3366 2018-02-19 16:42:57 Alarmed to see that all @LidlUK tortilla wraps, hot cross buns and fruit loaf from Rowan Hill bakery contain palm oil which is contributing to the loss of the rainforest and the threat of extinction to orangutans:(((

3368 2018-02-19 16:42:19 It is a brilliant idea to take advantage of the increase in US exports and make money out of shipping it... while reducing US oil inventories... in fact, too brilliant!
3369 2018-02-19 16:42:14 MT attack SW of Bonny: crude oil tanker attacked while transiting area. The alarm was raised, crew deployed anti piracy measures and reached the citadel. The pirate attack failed, at least one Nigerian naval boat gave support to the tanker.
3370 2018-02-19 16:42:14 Realistically no. China runs surpluses on tradr and current a/c. If they manage to conduct most trade in CNY, they do not nees to "print" to buy oil. And it also makes more sense for countries (other than US) to conduct trade in CNY becos it is more balanced
3371 2018-02-19 16:42:02 Diesel fuel = home heating oil + red dye to show excise taxes paid.
3372 2018-02-19 16:41:47 I had one literally light up in giant flames and needed an oil rag to get it out - we had to call 911 and i got burns on my hands 
3373 2018-02-19 16:41:38 What?? No sunflower on Zim trip? Things are not the same anymore hey. I think sebe tshintsha amafuth’abo :( back in the day I’m sure that oil was re used for weeks

3379 2018-02-19 16:40:46 hand cream is hemp oil. OMG  a very earthy nice scent hard to describe thought was it might help with my exsema (can't spell) or at least keep me from itching to death
3380 2018-02-19 16:40:24 Well in the continuing care system in AB we're using a lot of these poorly educated immigrants as personal care attendants getting paid beans so I guess they serve a purpose of sorts. I don't see too many unemployed immigrants but in Calgary lots of oil folks unemployed.
3381 2018-02-19 16:40:23 Yeah, it’s not for everybody lol my hair prefers grape seed oil

3386 2018-02-19 16:40:07 Better than sending the tanker home empty, I guess. US oil imports from Saudi Arabia have dropped sharply since last year, but they have still been running at more than 700,000 barrels a day
3387 2018-02-19 16:40:01 I've run into him before. That guy is a super douche.

3390 2018-02-19 16:39:31 Key to analysis of Orinoco Oil Belt attractiveness/feasibility is 'Energy Return on Energy Invested'. Current conditions are very different from those some 15 years ago when the first, very successful JV's in the belt were developed.
3391 2018-02-19 16:39:30 At the Federal level, fix power and the oil industry. State level, execute people oriented projects #iFMDriveTime @iamGeoffQ #iFM1059

3393 2018-02-19 16:39:20 Important issue for #RenewableEnergy. They may also called as peacefully energy. 
No one force to war you for wind, sun, geothermal, biomass unlike oil...
Use your own renewables for better world/ better humanity in future.

3402 2018-02-19 16:38:00 When your government stealing Muslim people, oil, minerals etc.. to feed you, there is No march nor speech about it.The hypocrites  called veterans are out now to protest simply money is not coming inside the wallet.
3403 2018-02-19 16:37:49 I'm sorry but anything desmogblog says is layered with BS because they make lists of people that took jobs at an oil company in their lifetime after they got their degrees. Then they say anything that person has to say about climate change is a lie and moves to discredit them.
3404 2018-02-19 16:37:34 It can only get worse ... Pdvsa just became a tool between factions in power to control it meanwhile oil production dwindles and workers leave en masse..
3405 2018-02-19 16:37:16 Vzla. oil may be attractive again (huge MAYBE...) in a different oil scenario. Also, it will take massive investment in infrastructure, specially Electric Power generation (hydro) and distribution. The Orinoco Belt is highly ENERGY INTENSIVE to lift.
3406 2018-02-19 16:37:15 Miss my body oil , so first stop is triangle then SBNC
3407 2018-02-19 16:37:10 Ha. I've already put that 1 out there & Oil fans didn't seem to like it. 1 less yr but older. If he can still pk, I'd prob do that.
3408 2018-02-19 16:37:04 Probably not at all, most analysts think. Gasoline and other oil products were already freely exported, so US consumers were paying world prices as it was
3409 2018-02-19 16:36:53 You are right on one thing it's not a subsidy. It's called an 'automatic stabiliser', which kicks in to provide funding for regions of UK that experience issues (like oil price crashes). It's also called pooling and sharing. This pooling and sharing covers Scotland's £15b deficit
3410 2018-02-19 16:36:34 just had some, and got some bread for the oil

3416 2018-02-19 16:35:47 I managed to hang with this movie long enough to watch the oil rig explode but I’m not sure how much more I can take. Seems like a very dangerous work environment even under the best of circumstances.

3425 2018-02-19 16:34:33 their massive interest in Vzla oil" Their interest is in recovering their exposure, Rosneft CEO under pressure for that. That oil is not so attractive in today's scenarios. Not the same conditions as when Total and Statoil developed successful ventures in the Orinoco Oil Belt
3426 2018-02-19 16:34:33 Notice they always say "moderate" when talking about the "rebels" when these rebels are still Sunni radicals. They have actually worked with ISIS against Assad on numerous occasions.

3429 2018-02-19 16:33:58 Better they repair it ,  a year ago we were about to board a plane and watched a mechanic open a cowling on a engine, oil comes flowing out onto the ground. We were about to board, thankfully we got another plane

3431 2018-02-19 16:33:53 That's a good question. Here's a few suggestions (at your own risk), you could try to scrape it off with a putty knife, spray it with a strong degreaser, and/or use a pressure washer.
3432 2018-02-19 16:33:50 Need different kinds of oil. Most of what we produce is light. Need heavy oil to create the correct mix and get the correct amount of by products.

3438 2018-02-19 16:32:31 Do you know anything about the real story there and also why many businesses choose bankruptcy at times? I worked for an oil company that went into bankruptcy to get out of leases it did not like. They had a ton of money.
3439 2018-02-19 16:32:27 Ecclesiastes 9:8 Let your garments be always white [with purity], and let your head not lack [the] oil [of gladness].
3440 2018-02-19 16:32:24 Huh. No one is making the comment about her being a "nazi" with her head shaved? Guess when it only fits the narrative of them only existing on the right.
3441 2018-02-19 16:32:11 I am amazed that that people do not understand the concept of depletion as it relates to extractive industries like oil production. The low oil price the last few years caused a serious decline in exploration and development. Not hard to understand or is it?

3445 2018-02-19 16:31:42 I forgot to put oil on my scalp this morning and now my scalp is dry  I seriously need to get up earlier 
3446 2018-02-19 16:31:40 I love watching conservatives inadvertently make arguments for nationalizing our oil.

The always talk of "Canada's oil" and why don't "we" build pipelines and why do "we" allow imports of a free market commodity. 

It's adorable.
3447 2018-02-19 16:31:36 Have you tried garlic infused oil? All the taste and smell of garlic without the nasty symptoms!!

3453 2018-02-19 16:31:10 Assad knows that the #SDF controls over half of Syria's oil. The great businessmen Tillerson and Trump are giving that away.

3477 2018-02-19 16:28:36 Also it's completely nonsensical.

Russia can't be a threat, they can hardly pay their troops, yet even maintain military infrastructure.

Also they are really happy to sell oil & gas to europe in order to get at least some export income…
3478 2018-02-19 16:28:18 While oil/gas have impacts, fossil fuels have improved the standard of living for billions of people across the globe. We have the privilege of caring for the environment because we are rich enough to do so

3480 2018-02-19 16:27:57 @todd_harrison  Todd, I was a long time follower of Minyanville during the day.  You may remember the one player in your NCAA pool the picked Butler when they lost to Duke.  Can you recommend a reputable vendor for CBD oil?  I'm not asking for a product, just a source.  Thanks
3481 2018-02-19 16:27:56 Need to learn to change my oil myself!
3482 2018-02-19 16:27:56 It’s midnight and I’m burning lavender-scented fragrance oil beside my bed. I’m snuggled up in my bed, reading about Dalai Lama and listening to my songs for the soul playlist. Definitely, all will be alright in time 
3483 2018-02-19 16:27:49 i don’t see how the water would help either, you could probably do with just spraying on the almond oil! absorbs pretty quickly, no?
3484 2018-02-19 16:27:38 You need your oil changed

3516 2018-02-19 16:23:56 Eastern Canada doesn't import oil. Private enterprise does. 

Why don't they use NFLD oil?
3517 2018-02-19 16:23:55 My question is! Is Andrew Cuomo & Bill De Blasio going to pay back the $billions NY made off of Oil Co. Bonds they purchased. #TheyMadeMoneyOffOfPolutionAlso 
3518 2018-02-19 16:23:52 Not sure.  Prices vary depending on supply and demand.  Places like Calgary have labour shortages for everything thanks to the oil boom... minimum wage jobs pay a little more than the legal minimum wage there.

3521 2018-02-19 16:23:45 Hemp Seed Oil has me more ashy
3522 2018-02-19 16:23:40 My fear is, as mentioned in the article, that less ice means more drilling for oil and resources. When that happens it's only a matter of time before it's totally fucked. That makes me sad 
3523 2018-02-19 16:23:36 But you let a thrice divorced snake oil salesman think for you? A man who lies repeatedly and fives zero f@cks about our country? Girl bye!

3525 2018-02-19 16:23:30 Anything that gets in the way of pumping oil is bad. There's zero appetite for genuine balance between resource development and environmental protection. This government particularly lopsided
3526 2018-02-19 16:23:29 Yupp immediately stop . I pakai simple cleansing oil
3527 2018-02-19 16:23:23 And even if that were true, which it isn't,  you simple assume the root cause and don't consider the notion of differing and sometimes conflicting interests. Or that there is enormous community pressure to maximise extraction (regardless of what the oil co's want).

3531 2018-02-19 16:23:01 Before frying, sprinkle a little salt in your pan which will help keep the oil from splattering.

air/water standards, frack on our Public land ad nauseam.
3546 2018-02-19 16:21:37 Certainly, but that’s not likely to get us very far, very soon. However, bio kerosene manufctr could be deployed in near term. Graun article describes canning of BA’s attempt. Not emphasised by Graun - main reason was falling oil price, govt. support would have made it happen.

3574 2018-02-19 16:18:40 I’m pretty sure they are. Most big oil is too. That doesn’t mean tho that they don’t want to profit during the transition period, which I predict will be ugly times. No one wants to be stuck with stranded assets, so they’ll continue to push their denialist agenda.

3632 2018-02-19 16:11:41 I've heard the industry complain about many "cumbersome processes" they're cumbersome if you're trying to get as much oil out of the ground as quickly as possible, which is the objective of prov govt and industry. The industry view has become dominant.

3637 2018-02-19 16:11:07 The second they agreed to the bank bail out they sold the entire country, lock, stock and barrel. It's not just the vulture funds though. You only have to look at the deals for our oil and gas to know our politicians don't act on our behalf.

3756 2018-02-19 15:59:43 Should pass this onto @cathmckenna, maybe she can fly over there and blame male oil works.
3757 2018-02-19 15:59:39 @RachelNotley, @JustinTrudeau: would it not be better to refine Canadian bitumen and use its oil products in Canada, slow foreign FF imports to Canada, and work towards full energy independence for Canada? That sounds like 'national interest' to me! #cdnpoli #ygk #TransMountain

3766 2018-02-19 15:58:59 She tried cbd oil but couldn't tell if is was making a difference as she couldn't afford the most effective one
3767 2018-02-19 15:58:58 Yeah, I live in an oil boom town. I haven’t seen rents at $1000 since . . . the big bust in ‘82, I think.
3768 2018-02-19 15:58:54 Governor Kasich is very good at playing the role of moderate nationally, and neo-confederate state-wide. Look at his actions on women's health issues in the state, versus his rhetoric nationally. Snake oil salesman...

3772 2018-02-19 15:58:39 Exit Crude Oil Short

-16,59 % auf den Schein
ca 0,4 % Minus auf das Depot
3773 2018-02-19 15:58:36 I don't think we should be subsidizing the oil industry when they are worth billions.

His actions on Malabu oil deal and Maina has mainaed him.

3778 2018-02-19 15:57:48 china is simply a cancer tumor of the Earth. Crude oil and gas pipelines keep feeding china, just like tumor blood vessels do, it is getting more and more greedy and rapacious. Unfortunately it produces only fast-expanding death to the host.
3779 2018-02-19 15:57:46 Hi Marcella, yes Krill Oil can be taken with Revive Active no problem. If you have any other queries please let me know.
3780 2018-02-19 15:57:35 They have all that oil $$ to spend on their Athletes
3781 2018-02-19 15:57:23 EU will never go to war with Iran or Russia cause they are both supplying  gas to EU and if EU threatening Iran or Russia guess what. No lie gas or oil for EU.
3782 2018-02-19 15:57:16 I’ve always wondered why LA doesn’t tax oil by the barrel instead of the price per barrel to keep oil tax revenue more stable. Maybe there’s a good reason, but we go into trouble every time oil prices dip and this one has lasted a long time.
3783 2018-02-19 15:57:04 JUST IN: Investors trade 1.287mn shares of @NSEcontact listed oil maritime services company #Japaul on Monday as small-cap company gets $350mn private equity injection from American-based #Milost @channelstv
3784 2018-02-19 15:56:41 Should have added cooking oil to the mix.  Deserves everything and more.
3785 2018-02-19 15:56:33 i need it bc my skin oily. I actually need more tea tree oil spray from lush bc it matte’s my oily ass face up
3786 2018-02-19 15:56:28 @East_Riding hi there’s a oil spill on the A1079 when leaving the slip road from Beverley. Not sure if it’s something you guys can look at?
3787 2018-02-19 15:56:17 #Portuguese Olive Oil is sub par.. #justmyopinion #Spain Olive Oil is the best!!!
3788 2018-02-19 15:56:06 何股かけるつもりなのだろうか
3789 2018-02-19 15:56:06 You are one dumb ass if u think EU will go to war with Iran or even US. Iran is EU's natural gas supplier for up to 35% and Iran also supply's 28% oil to EU and Iran being a close ally with Russia and china. They won't let EU or US touch them. There is only Israel they no match.
3790 2018-02-19 15:55:18 Must be due to the oil sands in Fort McMurray.  Damn dirty oil!!!
3791 2018-02-19 15:55:13 I made this pizza with black pudding and called it 'Blackhole Cuckoo' because it also has sliced courgettes over Swiss cheese on Zaatar and olive oil on thin crust. @wine_bot_
3792 2018-02-19 15:55:09 Digital transformation in a politicised context. Digital sensors, fibre optic transmission, and big data analytics permitting access to heretofore inaccessible oil and gas reserves. "Democratizing" access to knowledge about marine environment.
3793 2018-02-19 15:54:53 In my days:
1. The City ended at CRP Chack. Nayapalli has not happened
2. At the petrol pump it was “Half Half” for Rs.10( 1/2 Ltr petrol 1/2 Oz oil)for my scooter!
3. Dahi Bara Aludum was a Cuttack thing.
4. Yes, all of us were born in Cuttack as SCB had the only Maternity Ward
3794 2018-02-19 15:54:37 A guy is complaining about his oil change taking too long because he didn't make an appointment.
3795 2018-02-19 15:54:33 Crude Oil prints fresh session high at 62.44. #forex #CRUDEOIL
3796 2018-02-19 15:54:30 Get you some grease or oil too! Keep your scalp & edges oiled. It helps to prevent breakage & it’ll help loosen it up.
3797 2018-02-19 15:54:28 Fucking Liars#WaterIs4TheChildren Leave the OIL in the Ground Where it BELONGSHow about funding Renewable Energy?  You Have Blood On Your Hands 
3798 2018-02-19 15:54:19 Very worthily article! TY our history in over throwing other world leaders is something many Americans ignore! Much of the world’s troubles are related to greed and oil. I have mentioned these issues with others.
3799 2018-02-19 15:54:11 Trotting out vapid pejoratives like “warmonger” and insisting someone is “for foreign wars” is using Russian talking points, yes. That is correct.
3800 2018-02-19 15:54:08 I'm totally  fed up with nowadays episode, where is Deep the mastermind?  Will we finally see real Ardeep happy moment again? When? And I really hope that the one he always love is Arohi, not Tara. Always Arohi n never be Tara pls
3801 2018-02-19 15:53:32 You meant @WorldOliveOil, I only have one can of olive oil in the kitchen
3802 2018-02-19 15:53:14 Nope, still the British Army. They have been at it for far longer than the US and have done way more damage. Really american interventionism wasn't seen outside South America until the gasoline engine and Oil became what moved the world. We are mostly talking 1930's on.
3803 2018-02-19 15:53:09 手ブラは草wwwwwwwww
3804 2018-02-19 15:52:53 Oh yes the poor beleaguered oil companies are being outspent by a few environmental charities. Haha! 
3805 2018-02-19 15:52:50 It's absurd. If the treatment is there. I mean, how many drugs available at a chemist are far more of a problem than cannabis oil could ever be?

3807 2018-02-19 15:52:31 my dear Country, Nigeria is there giving Oil Marketers subsidy to import Petrol, a by-product of Crude Oil, which we have in abundance. #iWeep49ja

3810 2018-02-19 15:52:18 Yuh know woioiiiooo even though coconut oil is the friggin devil but still 
3811 2018-02-19 15:52:16 Because printing weakens the currency, therefore makes you more dependent on the government.  The Brenton Woods agreement after WW2 and the oil dollar allows them to print as much as they want.  Which will eventually ruin the nation.
3812 2018-02-19 15:52:15 “Countless wars”. What a joke. Obama’s inaction is part of the reason we are in the position we are globally. He should have intervened in Syria, without Congress. But no matter, that is being rectified now despite Trump’s misgivings.
3813 2018-02-19 15:52:10 You know why propaganda works so well? Because global warming really isn't that hard to understand. Scientists see unnatural carcinogens building up in the atmosphere, causing the greenhouse effect to increase. You just don't want all those wars for oil to be about nothing.

3817 2018-02-19 15:51:19 It was a pleasure attending The Way Forward on oil and gas announcements this morning. Thank you for the invite. We have great potential here in NL #advance2030
3818 2018-02-19 15:51:09 2 things: Oil being transported was originally purchased at top of the market & now sold at bottom of market; and it’s not being shipped in US hull with US crew. Trying to figure out why folks are doing happy dance. @EricLiptonNYT

3821 2018-02-19 15:50:38 Bersihin muka yg rajin, jangan langsung banyak, rajin aja. Paa malem oil/milk cleanser+cuci muka+toner+moisturizer (kl bisa aloe). Sebisa mgkin hindarin yg ada kandungan alkoholnya. Kalo pagi cukup sabun cuci muka + toner + moisturizer
Di aku lumayan bersihan, rajin aja pokonya.
3822 2018-02-19 15:50:31 Norway is a rich, sophisticated, homogeneous society in a rich region. With lots of oil. So even if much of oil production was state owned (?), this is no green light for Socialism, imo. What about 99% of other (failed) Socialist utopias? 1/2
3823 2018-02-19 15:50:27 Nakakaloka??? Di sapat isang oil control sheet sa mukha ko tonight?????
3824 2018-02-19 15:49:55 I can mix water and oil HAHAHAHA
3825 2018-02-19 15:49:43 No, Obama was a liberal interventionist that unfortunately spent an inordinate amount of time coming up with excuses for not intervening. But I digress. He is my least favorite president. Try again, and with moxie this time.
3826 2018-02-19 15:49:37 I think that there is another factor like management and geopolitics at the level of investment, because the exploitation of shale oil is a managerial and strategic decision for American companies or other..
What do you think about that Dr. @anasalhajji ?
3827 2018-02-19 15:49:32 Coffee, MCT oil & grass fed butter is on the menu today.

3830 2018-02-19 15:49:15 While not caring a crap about the country's oil export industry and largest wealth creator being held ransom by his party's hooligan supporters in BC. As if all the dollars that fund social programs via taxation simply rain down from the sky.
3831 2018-02-19 15:49:13 Ooo, great question. I have IBD and having a major flare. I've also not long started CBD oil ( for something else). I will let you know if it improves. :)
3832 2018-02-19 15:49:02 When crude oil rises, demand destruction happens. This impacts margins negatively due to inefficiencies in inventory management and inability to pass the hike to consumers.

3838 2018-02-19 15:47:55 I got here to get my oil changed and the dude was like are you sure you want to wait, your appointment isn’t until 11. And I was like... exqueeze me, my email says TEN?? Thank goodness he was looking at the wrong person but wtf a spook.
3839 2018-02-19 15:47:54 I watched a mum on BBC news this morning begging for her son's life. He  has multiple fits and responds well to a medication containing cannabis oil. The medication is approved in almost every other country in Europe. Our politicians say let him die WE haven't approved it yet.

3847 2018-02-19 15:46:48 As CM of Gujarat, Mr. Modi had announced that GSPC had discovered oil and gas. But now when he is PM, ONGC is buying out GSPC. What is the reason for this, if GSPC was making profit with its discovery? 

#MaunModi
3848 2018-02-19 15:46:47 It’s time to end our dependence on fossil fuels. If you can’t see the enormous potential in investing in renewable energy, you’ll be bumming in 20 years because your oil money ran dry.

3852 2018-02-19 15:46:25 yeah, when you have too much oil in the pan the edges get loose and the movement in the batter is pretty close to that lush smoke cloud effect. the large white pools of fire near the centre and then sweeping dark swathes of pancake smoke at the edges (　･ิω･ิ)
3853 2018-02-19 15:46:09 Olive oil on my hair would be SO bad. Then again I am just now adjusting to my face wanting me to put oil on it...

3866 2018-02-19 15:44:35 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
3867 2018-02-19 15:44:29 What else can we do... OK lower the shipping of foods. No over shipping ingredients and expending oil like it's not destroying earth. Find me a good vegan video that explain the shipping cost of a burger.
3868 2018-02-19 15:44:29 Shut it down and get our oil from US

3870 2018-02-19 15:44:25 Yea I was told that it’s non preventable. It’s just... you might get em, you might not lol no amount of oil is gonna prevent them.
3871 2018-02-19 15:44:12 You Yankees are daft. You can't see the writing on the wall because you're an elitist. I live in rural Oregon and you wouldn't make it a day out here without electricity.

3917 2018-02-19 15:39:38 At college in Michigan, 2001 I ran into a fellow student who invited me to his house outside of Detroit. His family had tons of AR-15’s buried in oil drums under their property, he said, “in case the feds came to grab them.” They have militias prepared to go to war as well..

3945 2018-02-19 15:36:52 An absolute disgrace. I honestly believe that if Jesus saw the way the church was being run by people like Welby he would be as appalled as he was when he saw the moneychangers operating in the temples. An oil company is about right !!!

4210 2018-02-19 15:13:49 What America & Eu needs to do is open up more of their own territory for oil & gas drilling to drive the price down & EU needs to find alternatives to Ru supplies where ever possible, Russia is not your friend.

4239 2018-02-19 15:09:54 There is another choice on the table. In fact, a few: not tripling the capacity to export dilbit; if there’s no appetite to step back from reliance on oil exploration, making sure it’s refined in Canada; and actually divesting from petroleum into green energies.
4240 2018-02-19 15:09:43 Great, then Ohio should plan ahead and learn to be fossil fuel free prior to banning oil and gas drilling so they don't need to use oil and gas from others.
4241 2018-02-19 15:09:39 More drilling is the old illogical argument of destroying public lands in order to save them. Who will want to visit lands ruined by gas, oil, mines, roads, and pollution?
4242 2018-02-19 15:09:37 And so goes life in the south.    They chanted drill-baby-drill while crude oil was washing up on the beautiful white sand beaches from deep water horizon.  Likewise, guns over children.

4251 2018-02-19 15:08:48 It wouldn't surprise me if it has something to do with the price of oil. If you can profit $65 a barrel on your oil and buy the same amount of energy from Israel in the form of natural gas at $50 it can result in more money if your pocket for the same standard of living.
4252 2018-02-19 15:08:39 I was offended to learn at the theater they don’t use butter on popcorn, but oil. I made her pour the popcorn back in the popcorn maker

4260 2018-02-19 15:07:43 These candidate's campaigns say as much about the @OntarioPCParty's members as it does about them. It says, in these candidates' views, most of the party's membership are easily conned, misinformed, susceptible to political snake oil, and haven't evolved since the early 1980s.
4261 2018-02-19 15:07:37 When China is the biggest oil importer, it does create its own demand for hedging. With real final demand and supply will come the traders and liquidity providers.

4303 2018-02-19 15:01:50 Within 2 years the benchmark oil price gyrated from $80>$147>$35>$80 per barrel while physical supply & demand varied by 3%.  Oil is a financial asset not a commodity. Backed by 800m bbl inventory, if China wished to do so, they could collapse the oil market price in days

4331 2018-02-19 14:57:17 There is an implicit up-side in what you say...

Have you tried CBD oil? It helps pain and is good for depression — at least for me it works. No side effects and perfectly legal in England.

Chronic pain must be a horrible thing. Please reach out. There are others of us out here.
4332 2018-02-19 14:57:15 I know. It’s like, once you get on that train, it’s the express right through. 
I use CBD oil. It really helps with focus and resilience. 
There are others on that same train. I keep an eye out, always ready to talk. Reach out.
4333 2018-02-19 14:57:13 #MaunModi As CM of Gujarat, You had announced that GSPC had discovered oil and gas. But now when he is PM, ONGC is buying out GSPC. What is the reason for this, if GSPC was making profit with its discovery? @narendramodi @PMOIndia @IYC @JebiMather @Sivasathyaraja1 @HasibaAmin
4334 2018-02-19 14:57:13 กี้ดดดดดดดดดดดดดด
4335 2018-02-19 14:57:12 Yeah, you just gotta dump in a food processor! Hehe. I don't have one so I just chopped it up (the head lang), seasoned it with salt and pepper then cooked it in olive oil! It was okay naman. 
4336 2018-02-19 14:57:11 It’s like adding water to an oil fire
4337 2018-02-19 14:57:03 SAJ Antonio Carpio: In 8-10 years, mauubos na gas/oil reserves natin sa Malampaya which can paralyze the power supply in the entire Luzon and can have worst impact on economy. The only solution will be the Reed banks, the problem is that the government is not fighting for it.
4338 2018-02-19 14:56:53 Teşekkür ederim!
In celebration,  for tea today, I shall have crumpets with olive oil and pepper.
4339 2018-02-19 14:56:46 Akhirnyaaaa, habis jugak guna Neogen micellar water. Next, nak habiskan Simple cleansing oil sebab nak focus on Illi cleansing oil pulak. Lepas habis Illi baru lah nak cuba Heimish cleansing balm.

4343 2018-02-19 14:56:37 lol at us making resumes and burning the midnight oil right now
4344 2018-02-19 14:56:27 The basis of oil won’t normalize above 60, save for episodic volatility moments, ever again. There’s too much displacement by alternatives meeting demand, particularly in China.

The Saudis are declining.
4345 2018-02-19 14:56:00 I'm not gonna hold you during black panther everyone's (male) hair was looking perfectly oil sheen and facial hair, I need the pluck for that wakanda oil...
4346 2018-02-19 14:55:59 When I read this tweet, I'm at a bit of a loss for why you don't think the CNY oil contract could be a big deal.  I'm not familiar with many markets where the elephant player doesn't dictate terms as their status grows.  Why do you think it won't be?
4347 2018-02-19 14:55:49 Good man to have round your table. Did a solid job #tullow oil.
4348 2018-02-19 14:55:18 "Don't type 'oil felid'" I said to myself. "Don't type 'oil felid'".

4352 2018-02-19 14:54:35 P.S...nobody "controls" me. I understand the deep deceptions of the illuminati over the centuries. I am on a path to seek the truth that they have removed from us such as the miracle of the Holy oil. I have taken it for almost 2 years and my pineal gland is healed. CANNABIS
4353 2018-02-19 14:54:33 Crude oil under GST can be positive?
4354 2018-02-19 14:54:22 Its easily explainable why costs are rising: the service companies, the drillers, employees, are all demanding fair pay again as oil creeps back up to normal pricing. Service cos and oilfield workers in Canada were shafted during crash, I would assume it was the same in Texas
4355 2018-02-19 14:54:15 Clinton = Columbine, Obama = Sandy Hook, no blame of the Pres. Trump = Stoneman, Pres’s fault. What’s different, CNN and Democrats organizing kids.
4356 2018-02-19 14:54:04 I remember getting orange pineapple at Zeller's, Woolworth's, or maybe it was K-Mart. I know it was next to the cafeteria with the doughnut making machine with the river of oil and the conveyor belt to pull the doughnuts out.

4360 2018-02-19 14:53:10 @TheFoodLab re: oil smoke point - published tables I've seen have massively different temperatures for refined and unrefined oils and obviously food labels are unclear. I just want to buy oil with the highest smoke point for searing - can you recommend any products in particular?
4361 2018-02-19 14:53:03 Don't be so quick to judge, last NAFTA rounds rendered nothing but squirming and posturing, putting uncertainty in our export industries. Auto is threatened by rules of origin, energy by US and projects like Kinder Morgan, which aims to sell to Asians in a bullish oil market.

4379 2018-02-19 14:49:15 في شهر أكتوبر ٢٠١٧م، إنخفض صافي استيراد النفط الخام للولايات المتحدة إلى مستوى ٢.٥ مليون برميل يومياً، ممثلاً بذلك أدنى مستويات الاستيراد منذ عام ١٩٧٣م. قبل ١٠ سنوات فقط كان هذا الرقم ١٢ مليون برميل يومياً. #shale_oil #الزيت_الصخري

4382 2018-02-19 14:49:01 Hmm..Fact of matter is modi govt approach to oil energy security has been quite disappointing - shd hv used last 3 yrs to buy large overseas oilfields. Instd frittered ongc funds to buy hpcl. Window to buy at cheap valuations now closing as oil is bouncing back.
4383 2018-02-19 14:49:00 Rig to shore is piped, not shipped. Only oil purchased from OPEC is shipped.

4392 2018-02-19 14:47:44 Its an interesting theoretical construct.  In the meantime, multi-currency pricing of oil will de facto continue shifting oil's reference point back to gold, as was the case from 1850-1971 (thru gold-backed GBP, then thru gold-backed USD.)

4397 2018-02-19 14:47:04 Look at Nigeria, they always ration the fuel to the extent that one time my father and I were in Abuja waiting to close to 1.5Km fuel line to reach the fuel station? So, if Nigeria is any better yet it has oil?
4398 2018-02-19 14:46:46 depends on how concerned you are tbh, like you can ask if they fry the fish in the same oil as the nonhalal stuff. also i used to hear concerns about the tartare sauce (?)

But be weary of too much NPR. They're funded by large industrials and it shows in their avoidance of underlying issues and normalization of many aspects of our politics/this administration.

4424 2018-02-19 14:43:56 Wrong. You are far too angry at God to have a clear mind concerning this matter. I was that way once too. The Holy oil has saved 2 friend's lives. Attached to my federal action are the medical records of a vet who was dying. His addiction to Oxy and 7 other meds is gone too.

4432 2018-02-19 14:42:41 fair enough. Penner was an Oiler back when MacT was running the show. Big guy, really similar to Maroon.
4433 2018-02-19 14:42:15 The world is moving a tiny fraction of its energy needs to renewable. And that's great. But it also is expanding its need for oil. If we don't product it ethically someone else will. There is no disputing that. Some things IMO will always need oil: plastics shipping...
4434 2018-02-19 14:42:12 Apple’s wood tables are lacquered; not oil treated.

Silicone/rubber and oil don’t mix well; hence the white marks. You need to retreat the wood to get the marks out, and maintain the wood.

4479 2018-02-19 14:36:35 Yes,well. it's not that simple really when you consider the fact that the global market is glutted with oil. Many countries can produce tons more oil right now if they wanted too. But that simply brings the price of oil way down.

4481 2018-02-19 14:36:17 no not Maroon. he doesn't have any clauses in his deal. 

Just consider him the new Dustin Penner.

4483 2018-02-19 14:35:57 You guys are just shameless. The other picture is the proposed Oil and Gas FTZ at Gbaramatu Delta State. Naija with shameless politics
4484 2018-02-19 14:35:48 We know there is oil down there its just not flowing so its a duster. What part do you not understand you fucktard?
4485 2018-02-19 14:35:44 I swear Toyota takes foreverrrrr to do an oil change.

4487 2018-02-19 14:35:33 Aren't these many of the same politicians who wanted the oil industry involved in developing curriculum?
4488 2018-02-19 14:35:21 Understandable... I mean he has one of those no trade clauses, no? That would indicate he likes where he is.   

I would be really sad to see him leave. I think he brings a lot to the team.

4508 2018-02-19 14:32:35 Im just guessing that those panels represent something other than just "honest help". maybe they represent some meager "crumb" while big oil rapes their resources. Just saying...

2. When Modi is CM of Gujarat had announced that GSPC had discovered oil and gas. But now when he is PM, ONGC is buying out GSPC. What is the reason for this, if GSPC was making profit with its discovery?

4518 2018-02-19 14:31:52 Don’t understand why the parents of a child who suffers seizures claim they are unable to get medical cannabis oil for him. It is widely – and legally – available online. I use it to treat neck pain.
4519 2018-02-19 14:31:51 That is why they are thinking about “oil to chemicals”
4520 2018-02-19 14:31:35 If they will not allow the prescription of medical cannabis oil to a child in Warwickshire, England, who suffers from seizures, why is the prescription of morphine, an opiate derivative, legal?
4521 2018-02-19 14:31:24 I asked my aunt to grease my scalp and now my weave is glistening with coconut oil.

The season is lost for the #Oilers now, so they need to think about next season. Patty could re-sign this summer.

4664 2018-02-19 14:11:48 What is clear is that guns are a symptom, and that a pragmatist like Trump will likely make a practical difference where talkers & demonizers like Obama were totally ineffective & only poured oil of the fire.
4665 2018-02-19 14:11:43 Ecological recession is happening for 300 years. Even the oceans are depleted. The party is sustained by an illusion.

4723 2018-02-19 14:06:18 Yep. I suppose we’d only invade if they had something we wanted, like oil. Or if they dissed our daddy back in the early 90s.

4907 2018-02-19 13:45:11 It's hardly a give away, since the oil companies must buy the leases from the government and spend millions of dollars extracting the oil.

5174 2018-02-19 13:02:33 Yes, I have. And it is ridiculous,  that you will tell me what I saw.
If you like, I could link a German newspaper article.

And - this mother has seen the effect herself. Do you think, any mom would give her kid substances like cannabis oil with levity??
5175 2018-02-19 13:02:11 No it doesn't, if affects anyone dumb enough to take cash off an undercover cop after he told you he got it from making hash oil. If you traded that cash for Coca Cola youd still have committed that offence. Now you are asking for funds off people for your defence?
5176 2018-02-19 13:02:11 More than WW2, it was 1970s which saw Ms fertility diverge from rest. Oil price surge, petrodollar, decline in US oil production all started in 70s. Now if all these 3 get reversed, will Ms fertility converge with rest ?

5179 2018-02-19 13:01:50 Hm? I think the MIRI/Bostrom style concerns are pretty mundanely plausible, and those preoccupied with it seem both serious and committed.

5181 2018-02-19 13:01:32 I asked my co-worker why, as an ex- marine,  he feels he needs to have three AR-15s. His reply was that when the world stops trading oil in American currency all hell will break out. And if trump gets impeached all hell will break out.
5182 2018-02-19 13:01:21 He denies climate change but because of his “connections” to trump, they will not do oil drilling off the Florida coast. Everybody else can go to hell. Did Scott sign a loyalty pledge?

The U.S. formally challenges Australia to be 1st to build desalination plants,utilize the desert,so that "Even the desert will bloom."Clock is ticking.

5187 2018-02-19 13:00:38 Living in a country that is highly dependent on oil at the moment, even I recognise the fact that oil consumption must and will be reduced to zero. If Norway and other oil reliant countries don’t pay attention, we’ll have a very different future 50 years from now.

5225 2018-02-19 12:53:33 So, because oil rigs might require someone in STEM, that means that feminists are okay with men doing manual labor? Very bad reasoning. 

I guarantee you, if an oil rig is paying someone for work in STEM, he's not doing manual labor.

I like the butter in coffee… With the MCT oil… If it is really hot coffee… And you blend that stuff up really, really good. Personally, I like it.
But… I’m equally good with just using heavy cream. And then, I eat butter and MCT oil… Separately.  Cheers!

5238 2018-02-19 12:50:41 Hi, AFAIU,, the territory where the oil fields are has never been majority Kurdish, and SDF/US seized those oil fields to keep Syria subjugated, so to say. So returning them would just mean returning what was “stolen”?

5250 2018-02-19 12:48:32 This is a useful analysis of an important economic and strategic shift. Investing in the electricity value chain is an ideal diversification strategy for many oil and gas companies, if they do it right. To mitigate market risk, they can sub-diversify by fuel type and technology.
5251 2018-02-19 12:48:28 Hey @Scaramucci We have hundreds of thousands of square miles of desert, full of oil, and gold. Australia has more empty desert than we do. I am going on an Australian media blitz, to challenge Australia to build desalination plants, and make the deserts bloom, before the U.S.!
5252 2018-02-19 12:48:19 Trump said they were built like “garbage” but that video is gone. WTC was designed during the first Arab Oil Embargo when steel prices went up five fold.  It lead to crazy designs to minimize the amount of material. It made sense only on paper - sheet rock and sheet metal.

5291 2018-02-19 12:41:17 SDF has very little leverage. As soon as the US leaves, Russia can take the oil fields. If Turkey, the regime and Russia all put a lot of pressure on the US, it would be hard for them to stay.
5292 2018-02-19 12:41:04 So in your mind we need to nuke Russia?  Nadler thinks so.  If you believe this article you are truly a Kool-aid drinker.  If you really want to hurt Russia, increase gas & oil production.  Lowering the price will bring instability to Putin.  Oh, that’s what Trump wants to do.

5464 2018-02-19 12:13:44 @netanyahu Probably you are upset about the corruption allegations against you.But let that not de-stabilise the perspective on Iran.
Iran is instigating you to increase geopolitical tensions & thereby keep oil prices high. You know this,but are underestimating that as a factor.

5471 2018-02-19 12:13:17 The only res arch done in this country is on chemically made cannabis substitute. Made by pharma. And it didn’t work. So they perpetuate the myth that it doesn’t work. I am a healthcare professional-liver & addictions sp cialist - CBD is legal here. Cannabis oil isn’t due to THC

5615 2018-02-19 11:48:07 I do agree.
As NRA alone is not good enough. Also get money of the oil industry and other lobbyists out of politics and hold each politician accountable.

That guy had a “cup of oil” = 250ml
250/4.03 = 62.00

5665 2018-02-19 11:38:29 Hi @broken6. The test for the active ingredient (THC) is set very low. The THC in the CBD oil could put you over the limit. We would suggest you never drive after taking such a product. If you require further specialist advice, please speak to your GP. We hope this is of use.
5666 2018-02-19 11:38:25 Yea, but my Tesla costs me £4 to fill up, I don’t need oil, spark plugs or coolant.
Only liquids I have to worry about is brake fluid and screw wash.

There is no such thing as a ‘clean’ diesel.

5728 2018-02-19 11:24:54 It’s a way of eating that focuses on low carb (get your carbs from leafy greens and other non starchy vegetables), moderate protein and healthy fats (avocado, olive oil, nuts). It’s been around for ages, was originally developed to help kids with epilepsy.
5729 2018-02-19 11:24:48 It is sad. The United States and the way we flocked to China have made it the powerhouse it is now. Pull the plug on the trade. It will go down just like Russia did when the oil took a dump.

5747 2018-02-19 11:19:46 The mother without realising explained why the Gov wont prescribe cannabis oil. The Gov is influenced by large pharmaceutical orgs and whilst opiates and steroids are profitable to them they will tell the gov not to legalise other methods of treatment.

5769 2018-02-19 11:15:42 As per the provision, the govt may levy an export duty of 20% but it would be passed on to the consumer. When oil was at $115 did you buy less petrol or did you buy more when it was $27? You bought what you wanted. Demand is demand and it doesn't look at the price.

5818 2018-02-19 11:07:21 Yes. However, OPEC could have also cut much more, as per in the early 1980s, which was a disaster for them. But US shale oil production increase is also too good to be true as there is not much use for its very light oil (high API).

5897 2018-02-19 10:50:50 He's allowed that flexibility. He just can't promote the sale of say, motor oil used at NASCAR; or any product. I understand where you're going with this but he's legit here in how he promotes things. Trump's been at this for a long time. He knows how to buck the system.
5898 2018-02-19 10:49:57 You said.   Not good enough especially if you are suffering when it may be something easily remedied with the right meds.  Phone every day til you get them ! Squeaky wheel gets the maist oil.

5924 2018-02-19 10:44:46 If you create something excellent designed to work well, but you don't resource it properly and as a result it doesn't work, the answer is Add Resource not "Reform". Public discourse needs to consider oil can and spanner first. So called reform so often cloaks a Wrecking Ball.

How much will it cost and can I/we afford it?

Yes money is important, its you that is always whining about oil money!

Changed your mind?

5975 2018-02-19 10:36:07 Thks @vvanwilgenburg. Not sure what Russia would gain from this undertable deal. Maybe the best for RU is to SHOW they advocate against it and deal goes through anyway, so that they don't lose face with Turks. Better SAA/YPG relationships get RU closer to Oil fields in DeZ.

5983 2018-02-19 10:32:26 For sure,Lebanon is a very polluted country,air,water,food,etc.Just an example, bakeries in Lebanon use fuel oil (mazoot) with all the heavy pollutants in it to bake bread,and those heavy metals and pollutants are transferred to who consume the bread. Sad.

6028 2018-02-19 10:22:01 Brando in "A Streetcar Named Desire" was not just a phenomenal stage/screen presence, but rather handsome all sweaty and smeared in oil, wearing that white wife-beater and a biker cap, *swoon*
6029 2018-02-19 10:21:59 "#Exxon is professional but in areas such as #Guyana, more is needed. They have to align their activity to local needs. In #oil & other parts of the #energy sector, companies are highly skilled & all too capable of exploiting weakness of inexperienced authorities." #governance
6030 2018-02-19 10:21:41 since they made deals (AlBab-Aleppo, oil pipeline etc) & even the murder of the ambassador had no negative impact @ca11iopE
6031 2018-02-19 10:21:35 Maybe cannabis oil. I doubt the others. There are other things that help too.
6032 2018-02-19 10:21:25 笑ったよ
6033 2018-02-19 10:20:58 Simon does your summary include the energy wasted in energy conversion for coal, gas & oil? I'm assuming it doesn't by the looks of it
6034 2018-02-19 10:20:45 There are lots of drugs not tested that we still give for exp: unlisenced BCG for babies! Canabis oil has huge amounts of benefits but it's all about money! Give the oil to the child and stop pumping them full of chemicals and steroids that are not working! CO is natural +works!
6035 2018-02-19 10:20:21 Try tissue oil
6036 2018-02-19 10:20:21 100% this boy should be given this treatment cannabis is a natural oil when someone gets cancer they go for chemotherapy and as We Know that is not guaranteed to cure you and some people get sick from the treatment and some people don't some people get cured and some people don't
6037 2018-02-19 10:20:11 REXXON, PRUITT, ZINKE, PERRY, PUTIN. Destroying our govt., earth, and democracy to get that last drop of oil.
6038 2018-02-19 10:20:06 oil paint hard af to work with but i’m determined to master this shit
6039 2018-02-19 10:20:01 Whys it so expensive to service your car, just for them to check your oil jeussss
6040 2018-02-19 10:19:49 I once had popcorn made with cannabis oil. I don't think I've ever regretted anything more.

6042 2018-02-19 10:19:05 I want to get an essential oil diffuser but I see a lot of conflicting information about certain oils that can make your pets sick or not. I guess I’ll stick to candles

I don't know how to copy a tweet, but there was a lady on @BBCBreakfast this morning at about 8.10am who's son has a rare condition which causes him to have epileptic fits 8 times/day
She has seen a neurologist in the Netherlands who legallyprescribed cannabis oil

6050 2018-02-19 10:16:24 Last night was a trademark Pochettino and Tottenham. They go behind and struggle to find the back of the net. They bring on Dele Alli and Kane. They combine to win and score a penalty. Coincidence? Which one was a better swimming pool, Anfield, Allianz Arena or Crown Oil Arena?
6051 2018-02-19 10:16:19 Oil pens r nice
6052 2018-02-19 10:16:11 All the 'renewable' tech is manufactured overseas. Nb it all requires coal/oil smelting and extremely destructive rare-earth mining.
After fitting panels/ windmills, where are the jobs?
How do we pay the massive import bills?

We often forget that these 'migrants' are from countries that we have destroyed for oil farming & for 'peacekeeping' processes. We need to look at ourselves because we are the cause of the problem!

6069 2018-02-19 10:09:57 #14 sounds fairly leftish, though it's kinda what already happens with various heavy industries already. Alaska does this with oil. But notice while demanding a division of profits, they aren't demanding state control. Another half point?
6070 2018-02-19 10:09:32 If the Dutch have already conducted tests with Cannabis Oil, why doesn't the H.O. request their results to be shared?
6071 2018-02-19 10:09:29 It will become a comb and walked, till she went outside, and thread to ask you must pour oil on the ground again, and bang
6072 2018-02-19 10:08:53 @autozone so if I spend 20$ or 100$
That is still 1(one) point of 5. Do you actually think that is a good idea? Why not multiples of 20? Joe buys oil change (1) I buy a alternator (1) REALLY?

6163 2018-02-19 09:47:26 they know the oil helps his day to day symptoms - but no one has a clue what the long run impact on him will be of using it every day for a lifetime - if the state allowed him to be a human guinea pig and it all went wrong then that would be a scandal too

6181 2018-02-19 09:42:10 It's from the Office of National Statistics and it reveals that over a lengthy period up until 1921 Scotland's tax revenues were siphoned off and spent elsewhere. Exactly what happened during the Oil Age, and as Ian Lang admitted, modern GERS is designed to obscure today.

6449 2018-02-19 08:46:08 Such a sad story. It's a known fact that Cannabis Oil really works for so many medical illnesses such as seizures and Cancer. Come on Mps make it legal on medical grounds. #Rant #Over.....
6450 2018-02-19 08:45:47 @BBCr4today sm astonished at the fuss of cannabis based oil for medical use, most strong pain killers are opiate based, some drugs under the dangerous drugs act which are freely given for home use so why not this??

The other options of course are Asia or Eastern Canada assuming Irving or Valero would upgrade their refineries. (Not to mention a pipeline)
7002 2018-02-19 06:50:11 That reminds me of summer of 2007. The oil price shock, the sudden news about bee die-off's, and the growth of awareness of climate issues. I recall reading about far right groups trying to seize on those concerns for their anti-immigrant agenda.

7007 2018-02-19 06:49:26 The Russians absorbed the psy-ops techniques pioneered by Tobacco, Lee Atwater, anti-climate Oil, NRA and have weaponized them against us via new Media. Trump even re-tweets it for them, the twit. So long as we fear our neighbor we won’t defeat this.

7012 2018-02-19 06:48:26 Maybe it's just incredibly dumb to advance carbon-based energy at this stage of climate change?  I wonder who'd want to do that?  Maybe a giant Texas oil company?
7013 2018-02-19 06:48:12 Adequately maintained they’re good for maybe 85k. Very well maintained no one knows for certain but 120-140 at least. Change the oil metering system so the crankcase and the combustion chamber run different oil. And a lot of oil changes.

7038 2018-02-19 06:40:35 読み専の意見ですが、趣味の絵(同人誌)なんだから便利な道具をあるだけ使えば良いと思います。昔の話ですが「社会人になったらトーンを貼る時間が取れないから同人辞めます」と卒業した方を見送った私としては、便利な道具があるなら全部使って楽をして！と思います。あくまで趣味の域なんですから。

7045 2018-02-19 06:39:39 I left my toddler unattended for literally thirty seconds to run stuff upstairs and he dumped and entire bottle of tea tree oil on the floor and half a bottle of baby shampoo. (All of which was well out of his tech, I thought) Kid for sale, price: free.
7046 2018-02-19 06:39:09 They likely do have fossil fuel generators too. This country probably can't compete with rich countries for coal or gas/oil so by giving them solar power by day it dramatically reduces their spend on fossil fuels. Well it did before that tit smashed it up.
7047 2018-02-19 06:38:52 Clearly, you fail to understand the sanctions which prohibit oil cos. From doing business with Russia,nor can businesses sell oil drilling equip to them. US banks cannot lend $ to energy based businesses. They are economic sanctions, not anything Russia can comply with.
7048 2018-02-19 06:37:51 bathed my face in rosehip oil. now I have to be careful that I don't get oil on my pillow case. smh I didn't think this far  lmao
7049 2018-02-19 06:37:26 I also feel like ... they think criticism of Barnaby is criticism of *them*? Partly because he’s done such a good snake oil salesman job of positioning himself as their ultimate representative? That he’s “just like them”?

7068 2018-02-19 06:32:45 The pain is likely being caused by an infection if it's constant.  Pulling it out may not change a thing. Clove oil, hydrogen peroxide mixed with water as mouth wash, and pain meds are the safer bet until you can see a dentist.

7096 2018-02-19 06:26:13 Yeah but your interpretation comes from a lack of knowledge concerning Canadian American history. The USA is Canada’s best friend but it’s also Canada’s greatest treat throughout history. Especially since the North may actually have vast untapped oil reserves.

7127 2018-02-19 06:18:25 Buy some clove oil from one of those 24/7 drug stores.  Rub it on the tooth and surrounding gums. It's a strong disinfectant. You can also take a Listerine breath strip, fold it down and place them around the tooth.

7158 2018-02-19 06:10:06 We can’t discount the effects of bots with their repetitive negative tweets attacking her, false news, Assange’s publication of hacked emails and Russian interference.

7162 2018-02-19 06:09:44 I spent $35 on olive oil today and I regret NOTHING
7163 2018-02-19 06:09:40 Just accidentally smashed a full bottle of lavender essential oil. So all I am now is essentially pissed off.
7164 2018-02-19 06:09:24 I pakai Hada Labo dengan Biore cleansing oil, dedua breakout. So sad. Nak try ni pulak. Hopefully okay.

7170 2018-02-19 06:08:55 Must be!  There was some post-war affluence but we got left behind by other countries.  The 70s were grim: oil crisis, power cuts, financial crisis, IMF bailout, 3-day week, Winter of Discontent etc.  #FBPE #StopBrexitSaveBritain
7171 2018-02-19 06:08:51 i need a oil absorbing foundation . my skin is sooooo oily 
7172 2018-02-19 06:08:28 Or has Petrolium liquidium/mineral oil in it,  some of us use cons (I personally don’t just cause I don’t use “traditional” shampoo) or doesn’t have water within the top three ingredients and and and  ingredient snob 
7173 2018-02-19 06:07:50 @NIkhilUkey6 @Noori19996269  I dont distribute people in black/white or tan. #Nigeria has discovered vast quantity of oil and Gold, so the draconian corporate terrorist is trying to occupy #Nigeria by dominating #Nigerians through #terrorism
7174 2018-02-19 06:07:44 The case for green energy is a socialist case. With a completely green energy system, all imperialist wars for oil will be obsolete. Climate change is a side effect of capitalism. Capitalists seek to destroy our environment with production for profit. We need green energy.

7184 2018-02-19 06:04:50 Do you actually believe the US has had it's nose in the middle east for going on 30 years for some higher moral purpose? Seriously? How many troops have died so the NRA can sell guns to Saudis-support some rebel force to get oil rights? The delusion is epic...and dangerous.
7185 2018-02-19 06:04:45 the balm oil gilead all natural handcrafted refreshing lil balm with vitamin E, avocado fruit oil and chocolate mint is my fave chapstick ok bye
7186 2018-02-19 06:04:40 Why allow Saudi Arabia to continue to produce 1.5% of the global CO2 and vastly more oil than Canada to continue to do so, which Canada needs to cut back? Why the double standard? Same with India, or Indonesia, or Turkey. All of them huge CO2 emitters?
7187 2018-02-19 06:04:29 My first oil balm cleanser is heimish. Unfortunately it’s irritated my skin. Now i pakai banilla co Alhamdulillah. Bau pon way better dari heimish. Heimish slightly cheaper, cleaner & >quantity.
7188 2018-02-19 06:03:59 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
7189 2018-02-19 06:03:55 I used the oil. I like garlic. I don't like onion. Can do without that. Fodmap made no difference to me after 3 years. So I stopped. Fructose is my biggest issue these days. Can't have fruit.

7195 2018-02-19 06:03:08 Here is where the law of unintended consequences comes into play. There is multiple research lines in Alberta now, that would allow 30% MORE oil in the same existing lines. The potential increase is 1 million plus bbls/day, with zero extra pipe. Keystone is rated for 850k.

7202 2018-02-19 06:02:51 Today has been such a crap day. I'm emotionally drained. I got some bad burns from the hot oil in the deep fryer when my dad accidentally dropped a chicken strip in it. And I feel like I'm getting sick. 
7203 2018-02-19 06:02:29 Yes, the good things outweigh the bad. I'd give oil a go, it "seems" to help & in some instances solve various ailments, deceases

7205 2018-02-19 06:01:53 so... now that people are "walking out" and legislators are burning the midnight oil, and the pro-gun group lawyer types are giving us the nuts and bolts on the bills... it means while you're walking out, we're calling our reps...

7210 2018-02-19 06:00:39 Yes, in the film. I like it that they made it appear like Wakanda is free from Colonialism & Imperialism. However, in reality, it isn't like that and the US & other superpowers like China subtly impose their power to invade & exploit foreign resources like oil & labor.

7214 2018-02-19 06:00:01 Yeah right - Trump is making great gains in the US economy, and allowing the US to frack which means it will become oil sufficient. How does this benefit Russia again?
7215 2018-02-19 05:59:40 Furthermore, they have controlled the amount of fuel oil one person can buy, but that's just one person. And they can purchase from other places to, without being traced. Sad, but true.

7217 2018-02-19 05:59:35 You can get longer nails by applying olive oil to help them grow.

7241 2018-02-19 05:53:23 No its not all we have & most energy comes from Oil & Natural gas because its much cheaper. Its too expensive to mine coal when you can get it much cheaper. We should be concentrating on Renewable energies. This is the future and we are getting behind because we aren't investing
7242 2018-02-19 05:52:55 Look what Dubai did with their oil reserves in a few decades. Desert to land of the future. Vibranium is symbolic of organized melanin, dark matter and dark energy, so, you have it.

7245 2018-02-19 05:52:11 So you're against Canada importing oil then? Where's the outrage about that? Is Venezuelan or Saudi oil cleaner and safer than locally produced oil? If you must get on a soapbox, try supporting local for a change. Protesting KM while ignoring our imported oil is hypocritical.

7248 2018-02-19 05:51:47 You’d think that a smell being described as “earthy” would mean pretty and floral and alive. But in reality, the smell “earthy” is more like dying, decaying soil, or tea tree oil. WAY TO DISRESPECT THE EARTH, ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
7249 2018-02-19 05:51:45 Okay..maybe they will phase out breathing as well. ..owww I know phase out importing fuel as well. ..and the phase out importing oil. ..then phase out importing planes because local industry will do it all wow we on revolutionary track to hell

7280 2018-02-19 05:47:24 Today’s drs have standards and laws to abide by. Smoking anything isn’t good. Best would be vaping clean and tested cannabis oil at low temperatures. Concentrates are more consistent and homogeneous than flower. Top colas tend to be more potent.

7282 2018-02-19 05:46:48 Dipping sauces. Toum is a garlic sauce made of just garlic and oil (safflower is recommended). One cup of it can net you 2000 calories and it's all fat. Use it with celery for minimal carb intake. Homemade ranch style sauces using mayo and sour cream also work.
7283 2018-02-19 05:46:39 By 2050, social media contact will move from being virtual to being physical. 'Hey @wgkantai Good morning from Riyadh. I have 2 extra barrels of oil, check DP (direct pipe)
7284 2018-02-19 05:46:26 In oil & gas we say “what decision would it change?”. Gathering more information has value only if it can change a decision. Shifts the frame from following the process to creating value.
7285 2018-02-19 05:45:37 If there were a massive oil spill or people need to be rescued. The cost would be completely be bared by Canada as the NWP is completely in Canada. Not to mention it would allow Russian, Chinese, US & others to keep military ship inside of Canada.
7286 2018-02-19 05:45:29 Governments trade aid money for oil rights and political alliances. The whole aid and charity systems are riddled with corruption and fat cats who get paid huge wages. When £3 a week can save a child is it right CEOs get paid huge sums in wages? Rotten to@the core.

7302 2018-02-19 05:42:36 Got it.. so dense objects naturally go underneath less dense ones. Just like water and oil in a glass.

Makes sense. 

But why is it that dense objects/matter sinks?

7308 2018-02-19 05:41:01 It’s simple. Putin wanted a president who wouldn’t impose sanctions, so he got Trump elected. In exchange, #TraitorTrump got ownership stake in Russian State oil (#Rosneft) to the tune of Billions per year. Putin has the paperwork & #DiaperDonnie doesn’t want to go to jail.

7321 2018-02-19 05:39:26 The more economically sound excuse will be to blame crude oil's collapse, for allowing us the fiscal room to do nothing for 4 yrs. Or else surely Acche Din by now
7322 2018-02-19 05:39:18 i wanted the argan oil..i’m gonna check their ig
7323 2018-02-19 05:39:03 I guess it is their cash, they can do what they want with their own money right?And if you want to get your knickers in a twist how about y'all asking about the money we spent on the oil industry? $235 million loan plus $30 million to ensure loan int free for orphan well program.

7326 2018-02-19 05:38:46 Thank u @NYGovCuomo Who gave the @nra so much power is what many of us want to know! Who do they think they are, God!? The rating thing has to go! Seriously! Things MUST change now! It’s out of control! They sell & exploit guns, not gold, oil & diamonds!

7328 2018-02-19 05:37:39 The best way to STOP the Russia’s would be to DROP the price of barrels of oil!! This would take them to their knees!! along with sanctions this would definitely Stop them from interfering with our election!
7329 2018-02-19 05:37:38 I want the whole manuka honey and Marfura oil line from @SheaMoisture
7330 2018-02-19 05:36:42 Russian oil industry depends on denial of need to move to clean energy sources other than fossil fuels. These ppl are being paid by Russia via laundered money through “American” GOP Super PACS. RNC is flush with Russian money. NRA is a big campaign contributor of this money.
7331 2018-02-19 05:36:13 Social Justice day. How about what happened in Syria when Turkey was buying Syrian oil off ISIS. And supporting ISIS.
7332 2018-02-19 05:36:11 Sear it in a iron skillet with a little bit of oil, then go to the grill for a medium well finish. Salt and pepper is all I use, in a plate of melted butter to top it off. And its gotta be a filet mignon
7333 2018-02-19 05:35:39 The battery is the source of power for many crucial components in your vehicle.

7334 2018-02-19 05:35:27 Don’t know how you cooked the bok choy but I stir fry in extra virgin olive oil (1/2 tablespoon) & little water. I season to taste. It turns out yummy & hard to over cook.

7337 2018-02-19 05:35:05 I’m not sure where I stand, but I think it’s criminal to destroy a good coffee with butter and/or coconut oil.

7339 2018-02-19 05:34:48 Psoriasis is a chronic (long lasting) disease that normally manifests in the skin. Apply Oleia Topical Oil –  It helps to minimize the inflammation and redness in as fast as 15 minutes.
7340 2018-02-19 05:34:33 Adults and children alike can use Oleia Oil to relieve the symptoms of asthma. 
Just apply/massage a liberal amount of Oleia Oil on the  chest and back. Oleia Oil penetrates the skin fast, providing anti-inflammatory action.

7376 2018-02-19 05:29:22 Oil might hit $70 but it won’t stay there. Fracking has made oil and natural gas easy to get. If the Saudis are only floating 5% of the company, why are so many people excited? Non voting shares I am sure. Go and invest in Johnson & Johnson.

7411 2018-02-19 05:23:08 Coconut oil is not supposed to be used on face, only body. The natural component of it does not allow for your glands on your face to absorb it well which makes you break out :(

7421 2018-02-19 05:20:03 Energy is commodity. Big oil and gas do not acquire products and services like IT does, the analogy does not stand.

7432 2018-02-19 05:18:14 Very smart idea for sure. I would say that a trade embargo on crude oil & natural gas would be very effective but I’d be remiss if I didn’t recall how heavily Putin has campaigned for influence in Israel, Cyrus, Greece & Italy, just in case Nord Steam 2 & Turkstream demand falls.
7433 2018-02-19 05:18:05 Yes it does! Please do look for it I promise you will like it. Just be careful because just like any oil I tends to get slippery but cleans right up

7492 2018-02-19 05:06:54 1. use makeup remover or micellar water with cotton pads to wipe as much as you can off

Look up the Bush/Bin Laden oil partnership. Our military killed ALL OF THE B/BL competition in Iraq, Libya, Yemen etc. That is the kind of “adultery” which has National consequences.

7603 2018-02-19 04:48:59 Hmm. I suppose I’ll have to buy some. We usually use coconut oil spray. Maybe it burns too quickly. I’ll have to give it a try.

7605 2018-02-19 04:48:45 Today I woke up from a weird comical dream where I was chatting with a relative who apparently died and resurrected. We spoke of another filthy rich guy, who drowned after oil exploded underneath his house. 

He always said he believes there is oil in his land
7606 2018-02-19 04:48:31  gotta work in the morning but also have to get my oil changed wtf ok ill be up at 5 am
7607 2018-02-19 04:48:21 2) i do the L’Oréal red clay mask once or twice a week depending on how my skin is. It exfoliates when you take it off and makes my skin soooo soft! Any little break outs i get i dab a little bit of tea tree oil on and it clears it up in a day or two!
7608 2018-02-19 04:48:19 If being a Good Guy matters, it must manifest in the performance of the Good Guy or those in proximity to the Good Guy. That is measurable. In the baseball context, “good clubhouse guy” theory IS snake oil.

7614 2018-02-19 04:46:23 Highly disappointed that @LindaFoods uses palm oil in their food. Your boxes are sourced from sustainable forests but why are you using palm oil and if it’s sustainable palm oil why isn’t it written on the box?..

7634 2018-02-19 04:43:27 It is still the exact same process of handling crude oil. Unless you want to believe that East coasters and anywhere else they offload in the  are more competent and able to deal with offloading where as West coasters would be just too incompetent and it would lead to a spill.
7635 2018-02-19 04:43:20 If Google is right, 18,800 won is $17.63 US. Might be worth it to buy it for the oil alone. Then just give the Spam to someone you like ... or don't like ... @BlountStrib

7645 2018-02-19 04:42:08 Hey @Honda. What are you guys doing about the fuel dilution problem with the 1.5t engines? Gas getting into the oil has resulted in my engine cylinders breaking down and now my engine is being replaced. This is on a 2017 CRV purchased 6 months ago. 50 days in the shop now.
7646 2018-02-19 04:41:56 Detoxing my skin and my hair, so it’s healthy. Which means no make up, no curling iron/straightener. No products at all for the next month , just lots of water and coconut oil 
7647 2018-02-19 04:41:41 My fucking favorite line from Randall from @NBCThisisUs “Don’t get it twisted sis. I wake up every morning next to a head scarf and coconut oil, I’m married to a black queen. Not that it’s any of your business.” 
7648 2018-02-19 04:41:33 Yes oh yes. I wish I could take time to confront these jokers and take away everything they own that is directly involved in oil. I bet almost everything accept for their lawn and trees.

7655 2018-02-19 04:40:27 I remember Captain Crunch and it left an gooey oil slick of grease in your mouth and on the bowl, that can't be healthy at all, but it was sure tasty!
7656 2018-02-19 04:40:23 I don’t think the unwind alone caused it, rather a combination of factors, including the unwind. Volatility, changing expectations both on inflation and growth, oil prices, USD weakness, etc.
7657 2018-02-19 04:40:18 Mental health is .. not relentlessly drilling down on past failures. You will never find the oil of joy this way.

7664 2018-02-19 04:39:21 No. The article points to the fact that the Alberta gory did not tax the oil companies enough to protect the fiscal future of the province.

I mean sure we'd like more pipeline capacity. But with fracking increasing USA amts is it in national int? Nope

7677 2018-02-19 04:35:31 State has no money Bc no oil is being mined and it’s not being taxed, but sense ANWAR has opened to oil drilling in a recent bill that might change soon but not drastically. Alaska’s in a recession in a few years oil will go back to higher prices bringing back large oil firms

7682 2018-02-19 04:35:13 So I started using baby oil instead of lotion bc my skin is super sensitive & dry in the winter & it’s honestly such a confusing experience. I smell like an infant and feel like a slug. I feel like I can’t touch things lol
7683 2018-02-19 04:34:26 Moscow was like: We either get the oil field (lol) or come out of it with first hand data on their direct strike capabilities.
7684 2018-02-19 04:33:51 Those oil downs were the business before this belly though
7685 2018-02-19 04:33:48 Bitumen is prepped and has to meet requirements in order to be transported via pipeline any reason you can come up with not to transport on pipeline there is a scientific solution for. Oil companies pay scientists and engineers for that reason.
7686 2018-02-19 04:33:28 I need a new foundation that won’t have my oil seeping through within two hours :/ i’m using the tarte clay foundation
7687 2018-02-19 04:33:07 Guns have one intention for use - unlike automobiles -but the car centric society could be questioned as well as an effective-safe mode of transportation but I believe the oil lobby is pretty strong as well as far as money to candidates -you want to drill in a national park-sure
7688 2018-02-19 04:33:00 It’s also on Amazon.

7708 2018-02-19 04:30:31 Give it a rest.  Nothing the US doesn't do 24/7/365.

1. Shell expects global demand for natural gas to keep rising for several decades. (LNG);

2. Shell selling off billions of dollars worth of projects including oil sands it believes can’t meet new low-cost bar. (high cost/low price ratio);

7728 2018-02-19 04:26:29 Doesn’t this view assume that oil export & extraction rates must increase? If extraction rates decrease, the most expensive (also riskiest) forms of transportation will be used less AND no new pipelines will need to be built.
7729 2018-02-19 04:26:24 Yeah I kinda regret pulling the manifold. I thought it might be cracked, but it was just getting oil drop from the valve cover. It’s an IH 304 V8.

7862 2018-02-19 04:03:55 - palm oil + olive oil has a more balanced fatty acid composition
- red palm oil has antioxidants, that's why it's red
- palm oil is cheap
- coconut oil tends to solidify

That said, it doesn't really make that much difference, as long as you don't only use 1 oil type.
7863 2018-02-19 04:03:55 @troytulo I experienced bone spur pain last year. I found applying castor oil to my heels nightly, a tablespoon or so, and then wrap with cling wrap and cover with heavy socks helped take all the pain away after about 4 weeks.

7865 2018-02-19 04:03:51 1) oil prices are half what they used to be, and most people did just fine 2) why would oil prices spike? If anything, the world economy may shrink, causing the oil prices to drop.

7888 2018-02-19 03:59:04 @Markyoiler  I think, and i do hope i am wrong on this, but i think news will be next week. If the rod pump has gone back on, i don't think its a bad thing, far from it. I think SS is going to give a dry oil unassisted flow rate,this is what you'll get with the assisted version
7889 2018-02-19 03:58:45 I was like that earlier in the week doing a oil painting, the blue paint got everywhere. Good luck!

7898 2018-02-19 03:56:37 Also got to look at the fact that during times our president's owned oil.. we were going after nation's that weren't selling their oil through United States. Nowdays we seem to be targeting nation's who have their own currency, independent of the federal reserve.

7954 2018-02-19 03:44:02 Nor did Rockefeller have the most expensive oil either, taking out competition doesn’t correlate to higher prices it’s actually the opposite, and don’t use anomalies as examples there is a man 110 years old who smokes cigarettes everyday of his life should we follow his roll?

8005 2018-02-19 03:36:33 おめでとうございます。魔法使えるといいですね

8007 2018-02-19 03:36:21 1. You're wrong regardless of your nationality.
2. The income slaves provided from tobacco and cotton was more than the railroads and oil combined by the time of the Civil War.
3. Slaves were used to build too, including Washington DC. 

History books concur.
8008 2018-02-19 03:36:18 A to the men on that one.....
8009 2018-02-19 03:36:16 The C is sucrose, P is casein and methionine, and fat is soyabean oil... how about they redo this study with more valuable nutrients...
8010 2018-02-19 03:36:13 Oil prices extended gains to hit their highest level in nearly two weeks, buoyed as Asian shares joined a global recovery in equity markets and by worries over tensions in the Middle East.
8011 2018-02-19 03:36:04 #schoolwalkout would like to mention april 20th is also the 8 year anniversary of the deepwater horizon explosion that killed 11 and dumped 230 million gallons of crude oil into the gulf
8012 2018-02-19 03:35:40 You said oil change and I’m like damn I forgot I need one too. I have to pay for summer courses.
8013 2018-02-19 03:35:31 We don't use ghee or egg at all & cook lamb in olive oil too. Bones are nice to give it a nice broth :)
8014 2018-02-19 03:35:26 Hi do you use peanut oil?
8015 2018-02-19 03:35:25 3. Utah is very mountainous. We have the Rockies, the Oquirrhs, the Wellsvilles - which are near me & beautiful, no matter the season, they always look like an oil painting come to life. We also have the High Uintahs - the only mountain range in the US to run East to West.
8016 2018-02-19 03:35:01 I took a shower and put coconut oil on my body and my skins seriously feels like baby skin
8017 2018-02-19 03:34:51 Can't sleep? Use lavender essential oil in your bath. You will sleep like a baby.
8018 2018-02-19 03:34:38 That is an insult to the lady that sings the oil spil song lol. Beyonce should have just grabbed the mic and shown fergie how it's done.

8020 2018-02-19 03:34:35 My mom’s so rude, I asked her if she likes my lipgloss fr the patrickstsrrr x Mac collection in MamaStarrr and she goes: no thanks it looks like you dipped your lips in oil ...

8024 2018-02-19 03:33:47 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
8025 2018-02-19 03:33:47 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

8035 2018-02-19 03:32:33 Trading gold for oil when you have a gun to your head fixing the oil/gold price is not the same as having a choice between trading gold for oil vs. other available options.
8036 2018-02-19 03:32:10 Private Indian refiners likely to get stake in crude oil reserves.@bsindia @dpradhanbjp
8037 2018-02-19 03:31:48 We should go to the one who brought him my oil diffuser and health shield essentia oil blend that is all.
8038 2018-02-19 03:31:18 this spill is becoming EERILY similar to the Exxon Valdez spill back in 1989. Once we get this cleaned up, we won't build another OIL RIG.
8039 2018-02-19 03:31:07 Bada Modi ji when you tell the people to sell oil.

8047 2018-02-19 03:30:10 Last one... Patients using the cbd oil are testing positive for marijuana not hemp. They are then running into custody, parenting time, and guardianship issues. Will introduce you to those patients/parents if you'd like.
8048 2018-02-19 03:30:10 Won't be the first time. US backed the conflict in Iran so that they could get cheaper deals for oil in the 50s, And then backed Saddam Hussein led Iraq against Iran in the other war. Nothing new for you guys.

8051 2018-02-19 03:29:24 I think your oil bath needs to be changed.. Or maybe you are using a special oil?
8052 2018-02-19 03:29:20 I hate the people who decided we need to take fish oil. I know the list of pros is long. The cons is I feel like I just burped up the whole cast of Finding Nemo.
8053 2018-02-19 03:29:18 I’ll be visiting the Bathinda oil refinery today 4 pm to take first hand stock of “Goonda” tax menace,strange that illegal collection continues despite @capt_amarinder orders to DGP!

8058 2018-02-19 03:28:19 The Liberal party platformed on LNG. This natural gas resource could pay for infrastructures like Site c in 5 years. Monies earned from oil and gas in BC could pay off all of our debts provincially.
8059 2018-02-19 03:28:03 I use shampoo/conditioner with vitamins in it. Finishing a shower with a cold rinse (it’s good for your hair growth and pores of skin.) I also have a coconut oil spray and a keratin oil that I put in my hair after I shower!

All it does is give govt friends TONS of funds. Union payback was the foremost way to start governing. Established govts could do it through roads, oil etc but NDs painted selves in corner by being anti oil.

8078 2018-02-19 03:25:25 So I went into the kitchen to yell at my sister for using my coconut oil mist for my hair 
& 
dad raised his hand & said “I’ve been using it I spray it all over my body i love it I’m sorry”. 
Like wth plot twist lol
8079 2018-02-19 03:25:16 Reading is making me consider how hazardous the oil plant by my house is #FSU2135
8080 2018-02-19 03:25:11 I thought its okay na.TBH they told me they'll do exorcise but the counseling + blessing of the house only happened , after that I stopped seeing spirits for a while but then just last week little by little it came back... then the oil the church gave me was found half empty
8081 2018-02-19 03:25:03 "Hedge funds’ net-bullish position in WTI crude oil futures and options contracts fell 4.6% to 472,792 on January 30–February 6, 2018. The net long positions fell for the second straight week."
8082 2018-02-19 03:25:00 So my sister bought castor oil to help her eyelashes and brows grow. When we were at home she walks up to me and says “I’m gonna put it in my mustache to see how fast it grows” 

Sometimes I doubt her mental health

8086 2018-02-19 03:24:06 Kind of? More or less for the companies than the product itself...

ExxonMobil and BP...

Especially BP after the oil spill trying to save face
8087 2018-02-19 03:24:03 Ordered. Sweet.
8088 2018-02-19 03:24:02 I'll never understand people who get engaged or married when they aren't financially stable. You're already starting off behind. How can you expect to take care of and provide for another person when you can't even afford an oil change?
8089 2018-02-19 03:23:33 Yup, Pence, Ryan, Hatch then Tillerson. I’m hoping they’re all caught up in this dragnet. I don’t think an oil exec who got the rosneft deal signed was made SECSTATE by accident. Sanctions being lifted on that deal was one of the things Russia was going to get...
8090 2018-02-19 03:23:28 I’m definitely getting my oil changed tomorrow I been bs lately
8091 2018-02-19 03:23:25 Need to know more but ? Group G herbicide or phyto from a chemical application (insecticide/oil + hot weather)

8093 2018-02-19 03:23:12 I know how to make a traditional satay sauce, but I find it too sweet. For a quick and dirty sauce I use crunchy peanutbutter w/ some of the oil from the top, w/Braggs and sriratcha.  
Broccoli in bowl, sauce on top, stir around til completely mixed. Nom.
8094 2018-02-19 03:23:10 Much like fish oil capsules that promise "no more fish burps!" I mean, yeah, but I didn't want to think about that.
8095 2018-02-19 03:23:08 I’ve never heard of that! I really want to paint a la bob ross and also frankenthaler (I know, total opposites) but oil paints are super expensive :/

8111 2018-02-19 03:20:06 Look at the mess Alberta has coming  cleaning up the mess the oil business has left as they leave. At least it can be cleaned up ,but Fracked wells once they  start to fail what happens then. Do you even understand how toxic the water/chemical compound they use in those wells is?

8132 2018-02-19 03:17:08 Oil prices extended gains to hit their highest level in nearly two weeks on Monday, buoyed as Asian shares joined a global recovery in equity markets and by worries over tensions in the Middle East.
8133 2018-02-19 03:17:05 Make sure to moisturize frequently too. Water first , then a moisturizing leave in then an oil or a butter to seal it all in
8134 2018-02-19 03:17:01 Made from spelt flour, yeast, sugar, salt, and oil, and hot water. Stir together the dry ingredients then add the oil and hot water. It's a good, fast dough, basically ready to go right away. I don't even proof it usually, but I did this time for 30 minutes.

8145 2018-02-19 03:14:35 The quid per quo was Putin elects Trump and Trump gets 19% of half a TRILLION dollar oil deal between Putin and Exxon, now held up by sanctions.  Trump was/is broke, but for the presidency and the oil deal.

8148 2018-02-19 03:14:12 Hmmm...let’s take a look at what he’s doing to our National Parks. He’s opening up nature reserves in Alaska for drilling oil. He’s pushing NASA out of the ISS. The tax plan alone is a sellout of people like you and me for a rich few on the assumption they’ll trickle down excess.
8149 2018-02-19 03:14:02 By the way, I'm opposed to drilling the EEZ. I'm also opposed to the wind farms in the EEZ. I'm also opposed to fin fish farms in the EEZ. Plenty of oil windmills on land, and fish farms should be land based, enclosed system.
8150 2018-02-19 03:14:01 Bet the sellers of whale oil hated electricity. In fact bottom fell out on prices of whale oil. More useless info.
8151 2018-02-19 03:13:35 You seen how much palm oil is in it?
8152 2018-02-19 03:13:32 Things could be worse buddy, your team could be the Oil. Hawks will figure it out
8153 2018-02-19 03:13:29 Yeah.. oil doesn't move freely in war time.
8154 2018-02-19 03:13:27 I drive an Elantra GT hatchback & I love it. It's great on gas at most my tank has ever been 35$ I've had it for almost 4 years now & haven't had any problems. I get the basic oil changes & just recently got new tires. Sucks in the snow though

8158 2018-02-19 03:13:03 Iran was trading oil for gold for years
8159 2018-02-19 03:12:54 Cooking oil. Up to this day I still don't understand what happened
8160 2018-02-19 03:12:50 Only the parts  that support big oil will not be dismantled #joke
8161 2018-02-19 03:12:41 Tbh use stuff like prenatal vitamins they’re also good for your skin and nails, try using a coconut oil with like, almond oil if you can get your hands on it and make a mask to leave in before a shower for like 15mins once a week, try not to shampoo every time you wash your hair
8162 2018-02-19 03:12:30 @KatRamsland Why is Oil such a lucrative resource?
8163 2018-02-19 03:12:11 I was under the impression there was a whole lot of marching involved in the military, so...
8164 2018-02-19 03:12:10 Invest in coconut oil grease
8165 2018-02-19 03:12:05 Cannabis oil is usually made from single-bladed "sugar leaves," which are high in THC and grow in the buds of a marijuana plant.
8166 2018-02-19 03:12:03 iridescence
noun
1: a lustrous rainbow-like play of color caused by differential refraction of light waves (as from an oil slick, soap bubble, or fish scales) that tends to change as the angle of view changes
2: a lustrous or attractive quality or effect
8167 2018-02-19 03:11:52 One of my cousins told me putting castor oil on my eyebrows would make them fuller 
8168 2018-02-19 03:11:43 Okay but like why is my nighttime skin routine so extra but yet so relaxing. Like it’s 7 steps: face wash, face mask, toner, spot treatment, a little rose oil, overnight hydrating face mask, and eye cream. And yes I do have HELLA dry skin.

8170 2018-02-19 03:11:32 you got any hair oil or leave in conditioner??
8171 2018-02-19 03:11:29 Again, you are cluless. A leech who contributes zero to socety cant even figure out that Alberta doesnt control the price of Oil. And also who could give a shit about the environment for future generations
8172 2018-02-19 03:11:20 Oil prices extended gains to hit their highest level in nearly two weeks on Monday, buoyed as Asian shares joined a global recovery in equity markets and by worries over tensions in the Middle East.
8173 2018-02-19 03:11:17 @KatRamsland "Evro Polis has signed a contract with Syria’s state-owned General Petroleum Corp. for 25 percent of the proceeds from all the oil and natural-gas fields it captures from ISIS."
8174 2018-02-19 03:11:16 Doing the LUSH hot oil treatment on my hair, I will smell good and have soft hair soon!
8175 2018-02-19 03:11:08 Castor oil 
8176 2018-02-19 03:11:00 Pretty sure whales, sea lions, other marine mammals or birds would not call any kind of oil 'clean' were it to spill anywhere along the coast.
8177 2018-02-19 03:10:59 Just heated yogurt no cornstarch or egg white. It broke into curdled pieces. Tasted mostly lamb not yogurt.  Cooked lamb in light olive oil for healthier fats. Only put ghee in rice.

8179 2018-02-19 03:10:30 @kerriecowan watching an old clip of you with oil, from your BS days. You put on some amazing shows back then. Can't wait for the next chapter in for story. 
8180 2018-02-19 03:10:26 これ？ドレッシングっていうか廃油。
8181 2018-02-19 03:10:12 And...if you want to know how we got Iran, Saddam, and ISIS, look to a joint operation between us and UK to unseat the democratically elected leader of Iran in the 50’s all to get our hands on oil. We opened the door and they walked right in.
8182 2018-02-19 03:10:11 Student: "Don’t Let My Classmates’ Deaths Be in Vain" 
Most people from the left didn't say anything when the Obama government was killing people in 7 different countries. Obama killed people in more countries than Bush. 
Hillary voted to invade Iraq and kill people for oil.

8185 2018-02-19 03:09:42 Should add that what I’m also doing is giving Obama tremendous credit for staying on top of the oil spill, but standing back and fully supporting Thad Allen. The art of leadership is often overlooked, IMHO.
8186 2018-02-19 03:09:28 It is time for all countries to hold the US accountable for using depleted uranium in Iraq and for assisting, arming and even protecting ISIS criminals in eastern Syria and its attempts to steal the Syrian oil & gas
8187 2018-02-19 03:09:01 Blonde It would look so good but If your hair is damaged from the purple you can do coconut oil treatments or instead of coconut oil you can do mayonnaise Its gross but it works (I have purple hair)
8188 2018-02-19 03:08:37 I literally sat above my oil diffuser so it would go up my nose earlier today. I’m going insane.
8189 2018-02-19 03:08:34 I hate oil changes smh my little light came on and I was like ugh already
8190 2018-02-19 03:08:10 Just took my 3rd shower of the day. Once this AM to deep condition my hair. Again this evening to wash out the obscene amount of coconut oil from this morning. And just now trying to make my son (who would be perfectly happy without bathing for a week) wash his hair. 
8191 2018-02-19 03:07:57 Africa has every natural resource to make it great. Gold, cotton, oil, textiles, diamonds etc... creating a utopia like #wakanda isn’t so far fetched. We got to unite
8192 2018-02-19 03:07:54 Except @lisamurkowski who loves drilling oil fields in pristine environments
8193 2018-02-19 03:07:38 one day i’ll own a buisness that’s open 24 hours for sushi & oil changes
8194 2018-02-19 03:07:35 女性専用車両の件、コメントしてる人が過激で驚く。そもそも女性専用車両とか縁遠い土地ばかりに住んでるからだろうか。
8195 2018-02-19 03:07:15 There was little wrong with the way AB government wrote curriculum for 30 years, then came the math fiasco, then oil sands and computer company special interests tried to get a foothold and now ATA is major partner. But we had it right in first place when teachers/experts did it
8196 2018-02-19 03:07:14 If your views are not typically "Albertan" (or at least what BC/Pacific NW people think of Albertans), then maybe you'll be listened to by BCers. If it's oil, oil, and libtard treehugger commie twerps, not so much. Good luck.
8197 2018-02-19 03:07:02 excuse my language... 
BUT y’all this bitch has me fully fucked up & I’m willing to burn her house down. In this moment, I am fully prepared to put oil on her windshield and lite that hoe on fire and let it flow under the hood of her car. 
Ok I’m done. Thank you for listening.
8198 2018-02-19 03:06:55 Well I am not sure the nation needs the pipeline. But for sure AB wants the pipeline and the oil industry wants a pipeline. But does the nation need it? I'm not so sure. Fracking has ensured high levels of oil production and USA leads now. @jjhorgan @RachelNotley @jkenney #Abpoli
8199 2018-02-19 03:06:52 Well, when you put it like that...

8201 2018-02-19 03:06:40 OH,no. Sorry to have this. Will he take Rick Simpson oil?
8202 2018-02-19 03:06:34 What oil what
8203 2018-02-19 03:06:34 Stopped over manipulating my hair. Hardly any heat( I went a year without flat ironing my hair), deep conditioning every other week, hot oil treatments!
8204 2018-02-19 03:06:21 Cunners reports tanker sightings when he hasnt been to site. Two of us spent a cold evening shift trying to confirm his 7pm tanker sightings with photos. He also tries to spin unrelated house sales and farm tracks into ukog news.
8205 2018-02-19 03:06:15 What the hell is her point? Is she demanding voter id? Is she just confused about rifles? This is the best kind of thought provoking modern art! It actually means nothing I am sure, but I will wait for the explanatory tape in the Twitter museum.
8206 2018-02-19 03:06:14 Big brother is now VERY paranoid. Their drug of choice is not crypto it is oil and dollar smack! BEWARE-evil walks among us!
8207 2018-02-19 03:06:07 Yeah sounds like linguini di bosco, wild mushrooms for sure. Sautéed in butter or olive oil and mixed with other ingredients!
8208 2018-02-19 03:05:37 Omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), like fish oil, appear to have anti-colorectal cancer benefits by virtue of their effects on the gut microbiome.  This is in addition to their role in brain/nervous system function.

8214 2018-02-19 03:04:33 Sure.  But that still implies the oil boom affected low-income SK youth more than low-income AB youth and not clear why that would be.

8226 2018-02-19 03:02:08 Bruh you hurting me.. garlic bread and olive oil
8227 2018-02-19 03:02:05 Pretty proud of yourselves. Canadians that want to destroy other Canadians lively hood are despicable. Your quite willing to waste billions yearly to keep Saudi rich by buying their oil. Well we leave our resources in the ground and have a country so far in debt at least 50 yrs.

8232 2018-02-19 03:01:22 @KatRamsland Was it over Oil Fields?  Sounds like it was over Oil Fields.
8233 2018-02-19 03:01:21 According to EIA WSPR appendix, exp of distillate, kerosene, and propane are edited reported data from CBP (Customs Border Protection).  exp of crude oil, gas, and residual fuel oil are model-based estimate derived from direct near real-time CBP reports.

8238 2018-02-19 03:00:49 Some people are saying that if everything really does go as our sweet Mr Trudeau has agreed, then he should arrange that Alberta sets up a special fast reaction team to deal with emergency oil pipe breaks or tanker smash-ups! What horrendous responsibility!!

8248 2018-02-19 03:00:00 Perhaps a bit of both, certainly. This has become a second career of sorts for me, beginning with the BP Oil Spill in GOM in 2009. Two things set that one apart. One was a young president trying to find his stride who had the good fortune to select Commander Thad Allen to fix it.
8249 2018-02-19 02:59:54 Ther r many parts to the FBI .
It's not like the same team is working on the same stuff you moron.
That would be like saying the guy who changes your car oil can take ur appendix out.
8250 2018-02-19 02:59:46 Of course!
8251 2018-02-19 02:59:23 Only if my greasiness could become oil. I would use it to cook for you every day

8254 2018-02-19 02:58:22  oil mask though??
8255 2018-02-19 02:58:00 There is god damn soy in everything. Soy lecithin, soy protein, soy oil, etc. It's as if 60% of all foods are soy-based! I mean, miso And tempeh is fine but soy noodles? Soy margerin? We don't need all of that.
8256 2018-02-19 02:57:32 Oh cut the shit Jeff, like you have never EVER had a cheeseburger in your life? And the only selling Snake Oil, is the slimy Schumer, or the guy who told us we could keep our doctors if we liked them Time to use your head-from-ass-removal machine.
8257 2018-02-19 02:57:22 Went and got my oil changed after work and the dude said there was barely any oil left and he was surprised I even made it up there. 
Not to mention I’m also working an hour away from home.
8258 2018-02-19 02:57:18 Could be a verbatim quote of a current day oil trader as he steps off a Houston trade floor
8259 2018-02-19 02:57:17 i bought african black soap, lemon grass shea butter and almond oil from the african store and really, yall cant tell me shit.
8260 2018-02-19 02:57:09 I bought this facial oil today and when I opened the box, it was all spilled out. And I’m too shy to return it :-) so there’s that.

8262 2018-02-19 02:56:59 Yeah I've taken fish oil lifelong & use a lot of fiber. It's clearly genetic for me. Problem is I can't PROVE it's genetic b/c I'm adopted.
8263 2018-02-19 02:56:57 Maybe I just need the right essential oil to cure my bronchitis.
8264 2018-02-19 02:56:37 Apparently cats also hate strong essential oil smells like citrus and eucalyptus so you could give it a go?
8265 2018-02-19 02:56:25 lmao fuck I just remembered I have oil painting homework but it's cold af & I'm pretty sure I'm not allowed to do it in the house
8266 2018-02-19 02:56:14 When did i become one of those girls that looks at diffuser jewelry? And what is a carrier oil?
8267 2018-02-19 02:56:11 Blood pressure & high cholesterol are typically genetic BUT there’s lots of stuff you can do (aside from weight loss) to manage these things. Eating salmon (or taking fish oil) can help w/high cholesterol & eating veggies high in fibre + adding activity to reduce ^ blood pressure

8282 2018-02-19 02:53:00 My mom and my big sister just wrestled me down to the ground and forced me to take oil of oregano...now I wanna kill everyone.

8287 2018-02-19 02:52:29 Sell oil in CNY & buy gold in CNY you get a ratio (number). Sell oil in $ & buy gold in $ you get a different ratio (number). Pricing simply does not not come  into it.

8289 2018-02-19 02:51:49 Yep, rubbing the chicken down with olive oil always does the trick

8292 2018-02-19 02:51:07 Totally different mindset between #Liberals & #MAGA #Conservatives:

On heading about a homicidal madman murdering innocent people, Liberal response is, “Let’s outlaw guns, so we’re completely helpless”

Conservative response is to clean and oil your concealed carry piece. Again.
8293 2018-02-19 02:51:03 I appreciate your efforts, but your dislike of Trump is preventing you from seeing what's happening in the oil industry and why.  Trump is good for economic growth. At the end we f his term, remember I said that. You'll see I was right. Have a nice evening 
8294 2018-02-19 02:50:52 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.
8295 2018-02-19 02:50:44 Scandalous that our govt has refused to allow the young lad who has severe epilepsy to continue with cannabis oil treatment he's been receiving legally in The Netherlands - very effective in relieving the pain & muliple seizures . Shameful & inhuman . #basketcasebritain @BBCNews
8296 2018-02-19 02:50:39 After following these Broward County kids these past few days, as soon as these kids and their peers are of voting age, it's going to get extremely tough for the GOP to continue their snake oil shop.

8299 2018-02-19 02:50:07 I frantically searched to see what she'd done now. Was sure it it involved suntan oil. The Fergie I found was WAY more disturbing.
8300 2018-02-19 02:50:02 hopefully we all learned the difference between tanning oil and sunscreen....

8307 2018-02-19 02:48:16 What happens to the real value (in oil terms) of UST's the day Saudi's Ghawar goes 100% water cut?  This is why it was once said that "oil & gold never flow in the same direction."
8308 2018-02-19 02:48:10 And another zero points for JP,  yet no one supports my stance that he is a draft bust for a 4th overall pick.
8309 2018-02-19 02:48:07 It was just kale, olive oil, fresh chopped garlic, maple syrup and cayenne.
8310 2018-02-19 02:48:03 Your thread is brilliant and brings an important perspective. Steins support of Putin also flies in the face of her supposed environmentalism. The naïveté to believe Putin is anti fracking b/c of environmental concerns & NOT b/c his wealth is oil dependent is disqualifying
8311 2018-02-19 02:47:58 Loser mindset
8312 2018-02-19 02:47:41 These are superstitious people who believed purified oil was oozing from a rock.Its the same people who visit Nyangas and prophets for powers.The explanation fits their superstitious dispositions.Superstitious people are known to kill/cannibalize  other humans for lucky charms
8313 2018-02-19 02:47:40 The West Coast is going to do it's own thing. DC doesn't care about the West. Save for Oil Taxes & Electoral Votes... Other than that..We're "LESSTHERNERS"

8319 2018-02-19 02:46:31 I would be willing to bet...that NONE of the mass shooters were NRA members.  The NRA is all about RESPONSIBLE gun ownership & SAFETY.  Too bad Hollywood & the MSM isn't about responsibility.

8325 2018-02-19 02:44:50 Throwback to when I was fangirling hard over Ravi, went out and came back to see my Apple earphones soaked in oil.
8326 2018-02-19 02:44:19 I need to clean my oil rig too
8327 2018-02-19 02:44:09 Unitil I can sell oil for CNY.  --> Buy gold for CNY.  Now you have direct link between the true value of CNY/USD that is priced in a non fiat regime asset.  The USD hegemony premium goes to zero.  This will be reflected in accelerated physical gold flows.  West to East.
8328 2018-02-19 02:43:49 tell him to try coconut oil. Does wonders for the skin

8339 2018-02-19 02:41:16 Went to watch #BlackPanther and as soon as I walked into the theaters this group of black guys started hitting me with bricks and when I fell they started stomping on me. Luckily as they poured oil on me, they noticed that I was Hispanic and apologized
8340 2018-02-19 02:41:16 What hot oil treatment is the best ?
8341 2018-02-19 02:41:03 I guess DACA is politics. The real issue is oil and gas.
8342 2018-02-19 02:41:02 Wow.  A true act of desperation by PES. A veteran? The Pittsburg Gazette? The oil business knows Carlyle stripped out PES profits and now wants to get a pass on the clean air act all while being profiable.  #OOTT

8347 2018-02-19 02:40:08 At this point I just want to know who has my Amazon package with peppermint oil and the last One Direction album on vinyl because we apparently have things in common and should probably hang out. After they've returned my package, of course.
8348 2018-02-19 02:40:03 Wife hugged me today “you smell like color and motor oil”....sounds about right.
8349 2018-02-19 02:40:00 Good to see midnight oil in the list. I used to see them in the early days when they still played in pubs in Adelaide. They were mind blowing back then. Round about the time of "Place Without a Postcard" a bit before Vivid.
8350 2018-02-19 02:39:55 Castor oil> Gel
8351 2018-02-19 02:39:50 We still remember how the mullahs 
sought refuge in the British embassy during the constitutional reform movement & how they were supported throughout the 19th & early 20th C. This goes beyond  Saudi oil money. This is about maintaining an empire.

8355 2018-02-19 02:39:07 Nice @jetblue adding back the olive oil with bread on Mint. The olive oil has always been a #paxex highlight for me. It briefly disappeared about a month ago. Transmitting from #flyfi on B6197 to SEA. :) #fb

8358 2018-02-19 02:38:25 At night, after I get out of my hot ass shower I do the same thing with my witch hazel.

8363 2018-02-19 02:37:41 Oil companies are not having record profits. Try reading the quarterly reports. I stated earlier you need business sources, not political ones. Even opinion pieces can be a business source.
8364 2018-02-19 02:37:36 @bella vapes. We have 750mg CBD oil that would be greay in a vape

8366 2018-02-19 02:37:28 Beard Oil is key
8367 2018-02-19 02:37:18 is there anything better than running to the store to buy ice cream with 0 make up on and a slicked ballerina bun with moroccan oil in it making u look bald and THEN STILL being told youre very beautiful by a sweet old lady wow my heart
8368 2018-02-19 02:36:54 They don't, and they never will, but gold may vary in  value by refernce to oil. While  Gold retains a potential trust role in trade clearing, it no longer even  residual relevance to the everyday life of the man in the street.
8369 2018-02-19 02:36:40 Three slash four cup vegetable oil.

8375 2018-02-19 02:35:52 my best friend has a cbd oil that she uses and swears by. for me when i smoke, it’s hit or miss. sometimes it helps, sometimes it makes it worse. i would recommend cbd especially if breaking edge is an uncomfortable thought for you!!
8376 2018-02-19 02:35:49 Have you ever looked into or tried CBD oil? I've done a lot of research on it for other things but I always see examples of people using it for chronic pain bcus of its strong anti-inflammatory properties and such.

8378 2018-02-19 02:34:52 @ankaris maybe if I nagged you more about doing more oil paintings, you might find more "inspiration". :D ( I jest of course)
8379 2018-02-19 02:34:44 Huh. No one is making the comment about her being a "nazi" with her head shaved? Huh. Guess when it only fits the narrative of them only existing on the right.

8382 2018-02-19 02:34:25 I think it's an ideological sticking point for conservatives. Carbon taxes don't jive with their philosophy of low taxes. Also, oil is the only economic driver they care about.
8383 2018-02-19 02:34:01 Yeah I tried the marker style once and liked how it handled, but with the amount of primer, powder, and shadow I have to put on to control the oil in my skin, it was demolishing the tip. x-x

8392 2018-02-19 02:32:39 The Koch brothers are a special kind of nasty, despicable humans. Grandaddy Koch helped Nazi Germany build oil refineries.  Their heinous crimes against humanity are numerous.
8393 2018-02-19 02:32:27 Plus you save a crapload on gas, oil and maintenance costs
8394 2018-02-19 02:32:19 So cleannn. I cant even tell its oil
8395 2018-02-19 02:31:54 The AI industry will be the next industry to supersede human decency, like oil.
8396 2018-02-19 02:31:25 Ah, yes.  I understand that's how you practice to endure flaying, flensing, and being immersed in boiling oil.  Also psychological tortures based on tedium.
8397 2018-02-19 02:31:24 Formula for success: rise early, work hard, strike oil.

8403 2018-02-19 02:30:50 I think the take away is that he is just showing that he not the president's man but rather big oil's. Not sure we should be celebrating the government being outright handed over to big business and the president's unwillingness/ inability to do anything about it.
8404 2018-02-19 02:30:41 Of course! Coconut oil seems to work for everything lol
8405 2018-02-19 02:30:37 Agreed.  And if China, Russia, & Iran use oil to arbitrarily define gold at a different price than COMEX/NYMEX does, it has massive geopolitical, & FX, energy, & gold market implications.

8412 2018-02-19 02:29:02 Regulate the internet? Everyone who sees the internet as an opportunity to exploit and deceive people just sent checks to the law makers they own to continue the snake oil sales.
8413 2018-02-19 02:28:26 It’s unreal I already did my first oil change on my car. 
8414 2018-02-19 02:28:03 An it's all due to the increase in oil price. Alberta, bc and Quebec are all failing so far this year. And if you need further proof that carbon tax doesn't work I advise you to look into the Australian carbon tax failure.

8419 2018-02-19 02:26:58 A ratio is a number. The question then is what it represents. China seeks to  control the oil price, which requires manipulating supply & demand of physical oil, not supply & demand of dollars, gold,  Bitcoin or anything else.
8420 2018-02-19 02:26:58 i love showers & i love to brush my teeth . idk if my favorite part is putting coconut oil & jergens on after i finished drying off or putting on carmex after wiping off the excess water around my lips

8432 2018-02-19 02:24:39 No comfort knowing idiot Rick Perry is charge of our reactors.  He thought Dept. of Energy was about oil, not nuclear power. Seriously.

8434 2018-02-19 02:24:28 "The world can never know
How sad I feel 
My hurt is like oil and water that can’t be mixed
For me, the attention ends when I’m breathing at the surface 
I want to show as well,
the small lonely kid in the depths of ocean
My worth."  -Whailen 52.
8435 2018-02-19 02:24:21 Korean cleansing oil is the best. Coconut oil is ok but jojaba oil or a cleansing oil will be less likely to break you out. 

I have acne and wear foundation everyday. It’s a struggle to find what works.
8436 2018-02-19 02:23:58 FUN FACT
If you put coconut oil in your beard while it’s still warm from the shower it turns into #superbeard and you get all di womenz
8437 2018-02-19 02:23:56 Sounds about right...... edutwitter and hard topics are like oil and water.

8441 2018-02-19 02:23:44 I’ve heard coconut oil works really well for eczema. Obviously as long as he’s not allergic to coconut.
8442 2018-02-19 02:23:39 Yikes, I think that snake oil salesman is bringing Trouble right here to Hope Valley. He’s selling Potions in a bottle, separating a gentlemen from a bum, with a capital "B," And that rhymes with "T" and that stands for tonics! #hearties @hallmarkchannel
8443 2018-02-19 02:23:37 You are your greedy gang of immoral immature sacrilegious coal, oil, and cash idol worshipers are blindly or worse, knowingly literally killing humanity. Great job, RIP United States and World. I will be praying for us and especially for your retched soles. Exaggeration!?

8450 2018-02-19 02:22:41 hhhhhh big wish that i!!! freaking!!! could!!! but i must continue to shove oil paints down my gullet in hopes of sweet release :^(
8451 2018-02-19 02:22:37 Nothing to fear. Canada's new export is feminism and "Canadian" aka my morality instead of oil, natural resources and Canadian technology :)
8452 2018-02-19 02:22:33 you know what the world needs more of? moms peddling essential oil pyramid schemes
8453 2018-02-19 02:22:31 That said there is no reason why the Second amendment, like every other amendment from that, cannot be modified to fit the 21st century.

8457 2018-02-19 02:22:12 This pipeline would see the no. of tankers in Burrard Inlet jump from 5 a month to 34. The amount of oil shipped. Jump 3xs what it is now. Up to around 850,000 . Will the tankers be larger than what we now see in English Bay.

8460 2018-02-19 02:21:36 I love the palace intrigue but I'm hesitant to ascribe any sort of integrity to Tillerson. He's in bed with Sechin, Rosneft and Putin and still has over $200 million in Exxon.  It's all about the oil money.  He can still be evil without tearing the system down.

8462 2018-02-19 02:21:14 The three main forces in Iranian politics at the time were the Monarchy, a Left-Leaning, progressive parliament, and the Clergy, who had always been a political institution. 

A Left-leaning PM was elected and decided to stop just giving the British their oil for free....

8464 2018-02-19 02:21:06 I will! I mixed it in with my deep conditioner the other night. Still trying to figure out if it’s better as a moisturizing oil or a sealant

8478 2018-02-19 02:18:32 $2 million/year cost?  If they don’t have attendance or TV revenue, there’s no way that school can afford to keep it!

8480 2018-02-19 02:18:26 being an international fan is hard tho. it's like you're million miles away from ur idol but still keep supporting them.

8483 2018-02-19 02:18:06 You need progressives and their mistakes to reset the economy periodically.  Otherwise, capital keeps accumulating in the same few hands. "Kill oil, go solar", and a whole new industry with new players gets born.  Doesn't matter whether it needed to exist or not.
8484 2018-02-19 02:18:02 I wonder if the snake oil salesman sells love potion? lol  #Hearties
8485 2018-02-19 02:17:48 Chicken and protein pasta with squash, zucchini, carrots, and kale in a garlic and olive oil dressing is by far one of my favorite meal preps 
8486 2018-02-19 02:17:45 When have I claimed anything of the sort about the NRA? Communication break down if we insist on putting words in each other's mouth.
8487 2018-02-19 02:17:21 Writing a paper nd watching the All Star game mix like oil and water
8488 2018-02-19 02:17:19 @acoyne What about all the oil tankers that already move down the coast then: are you throwing your bodies in their way?

8491 2018-02-19 02:16:34 Luke seems to be thinking of gold as a oil hedge.
8492 2018-02-19 02:16:19 COOOL , One of our Oil heaters went out so we are working with one for the living room and we need 2 of them . baseboard costs way to much to run around 500 a month to run baseboard .

8494 2018-02-19 02:16:07 I had a dry spot on my face for 2 weeks. Used that palmers oil cleanser for 3 days and it was gone.  i love that shit
8495 2018-02-19 02:15:46 Stir together 3 pints chili with 1/3 cup jerky. Blend with Olive Oil. Mix until crumbly. Serve with chili
8496 2018-02-19 02:15:45 The aloe vera gel, witch hazel and tea tree oil is basically homes Benadryl. It will really help with itching.
8497 2018-02-19 02:15:43 @pinoytapsilog 2. MacGyver's holistic approach plus his ingenuity in extinguishing an oil wellhead aided by a cassette player & plastic bucket--which I heard are bound by the law of physics--is definitely better than FPJ's hackneyed way of shooting enemies in his pomaded head
8498 2018-02-19 02:15:28 The oil companies have been lying for years.
8499 2018-02-19 02:15:21 It's been an age since I made a really good spag bol. I went all in. There are bay leaves, there are sundried tomatoes, there is like 1/3 bottle of cab sauv. There is a bit of oil floating on top. The pasta water is roiling so hard I told it to simmer down. #foodismyfavourite

8506 2018-02-19 02:14:14 Midnight Oil! Cool.
8507 2018-02-19 02:14:14 It saves friendships. I have a friend I've known for 25 years and if we talked politics we probably wouldn't be friends anymore. He's a white male, lives in Texas, and works for oil companies.
8508 2018-02-19 02:14:03 What is it with Robyn and burning things on #WorstCooks ?! First her hands (LOL) and then this olive oil

8510 2018-02-19 02:13:47 @Clinique Why,why,WHY did you have 2 put mango seed butter in HydroBlur!?! I am allergic to mangos!

8519 2018-02-19 02:12:22 And the dissatisfied that bought the snake oil
8520 2018-02-19 02:12:13 Oh, there’s much more. They want to seize the banks, telecommunications companies and the oil industry.
8521 2018-02-19 02:12:09 Few skyscrapers and The Apprentice? 
Trump is basically out of the construction business these days and doesn’t own most of his foreign hotels. 
He sells snake oil.
8522 2018-02-19 02:12:09 I go there rarely but do once in a while
I know, they’re terrible
They have the kimchi that I like, and big jugs of peanut oil for deep frying
8523 2018-02-19 02:12:03 That’s what i use. I also have the Alikay avocado mask. I never tried hot oil treatment.

8526 2018-02-19 02:11:21 I agree.  Just say you want to sell oil.
8527 2018-02-19 02:11:18 I think I put too much black seed oil on my face

8531 2018-02-19 02:11:05 Coconut oil busted all over my backseat 
8532 2018-02-19 02:10:59 Neutrogena body oil is also sensational
8533 2018-02-19 02:10:56 Remember when #MAGA-morons said #Dotard was going to "drain the swamp?" These kids didn't vote but they know snake oil when they see it.
8534 2018-02-19 02:10:43 LMAO. Look at gawd. Fry unripened plantain chunks, then smash them in a mortar with a pestle (or strong plastic bowl) with olive oil, salt, and garlic to taste.
8535 2018-02-19 02:10:39 Is vape juice an essential oil?
8536 2018-02-19 02:10:38 Yeah, much better to keep weak gun control laws that don’t work. When will the body count be sufficient to pass the legislative hurdle?

8540 2018-02-19 02:10:09 1/ My 1-week report on The Ordinary skincare: I love it. I use Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA morning and night and the 7% glycolic at night. I added a drop of Marula Oil whenever I felt like my skin needed it. I focused on exfoliation because I haven't had a facial in ages.
8541 2018-02-19 02:10:09 LARGE AMOUNT OF OIL   IN THE LEFT LANE
8542 2018-02-19 02:10:05 Try hot oil treatments too. I did one with coconut, black castor, sweet almond, and olive oils. The bentonite clay mask is great, I make mine with ACV.
8543 2018-02-19 02:10:03 Same! Will be burning the midnight oil tonight and tomorrow just to catch up 
8544 2018-02-19 02:10:03 This is what china and Russia are doing w gold.  DSK wrote paper in 2011 advocating pricing certain commodities like oil and gold in SDR instead of USD.
8545 2018-02-19 02:09:42 This is why you can't see what a fraud trump is. You don't accept facts when they don't suit you, and then you deflect to false attacks Obama or Hillary or whoever. The #TaxScam had no justification and hurts working people. (Oil) corporations were already having record profits.
8546 2018-02-19 02:09:41 If you can give me a decongestant that doesn’t raise my blood pressure or interact with my Zoloft and Zantac, great. 

Until that time or until my sinuses fully drain, I’m going to live in a cloud of eucalyptus essential oil.
8547 2018-02-19 02:09:19 Coconut oil just fixes it all

8552 2018-02-19 02:08:25 Yes, we know @andrewscheer is working for the internation oil companies. Your question is whether Trudeau is also bound by their money as CPC is, or will he do what'sbest for CANADIANS? #cdnpoli

8555 2018-02-19 02:07:48 WD40 is my go-to for stuck stuff. Except for bubble gum stuck on your daughter's eyelashes. Then olive oil.
8556 2018-02-19 02:07:45 I tried coconut oil on my hair last week & it was a disgrace...I’m sticking to the thick ass castor oil lol
8557 2018-02-19 02:07:37 PSA: IF SOMETHING IS IN PLASTIC THEN IT'S NOT VEGAN!! PLASTIC IS MADE FROM OIL WHICH IS MADE FROM DEAD DINOSAURS!!

Some things we will be able to turn back after this administration, yet I worry about nature.  Enjoy - be well!

I've read elsewhere that she likes pink cats. True?
8563 2018-02-19 02:06:38 I washed every two weeks, oiled my scalp with a light oil regularly, I used a mask like twice since I big chopped. I also did a green tea treatment like a month ago

8568 2018-02-19 02:06:12 A VERY tragic situation  ...... he desperately needs the cannabis oil to have any quality of life which this little boy DESERVES  ......
8569 2018-02-19 02:05:18 That part is true, but Obama's regulations and blocking pipelines would have continued to hurt the oil industry. It also doesn't magically increase demand. Trump did that, as I explained. Obama's policies consistently hurt US businesses, which is why the low GDP growth.
8570 2018-02-19 02:05:03 @Kadejah33044422 I receive my prescription...I love the Vice channel..and especially "Bong Appetit."  Just want to ask a question...have you cooked with/used/consumed food infused with cannabis oil/cannabis??  Is the "therapeutic" (lol) result different in any way? Just wondering

8573 2018-02-19 02:04:51 Vibranium = oil, diamonds, and even PEOPLE. Precious resources pillaged, raped, and plundered by others. Wow.
8574 2018-02-19 02:04:50 Lepas habis koleq dulu aku ada le kerja part time bancuh air kat kedai parents member aku.

Lepas tu makcik bawang sorang ni nampak aku, terus tanya; 
"Dulu MCKK kan? Kerja kedai makan je?"

Kau hengat budak 18 tahun terus jadi lawyer/doktor/join oil & gas gamaknya penampaq nak?

8576 2018-02-19 02:04:30 La acabo de ver! Lastima que la entrevistadora no tocara el tema de Venezuela. Recuerda que soy un "Venezuelan Oil Brat" (Creole/Exxon) y es obvio que tengo cierta parcialidad por Tillerson y todos aquellos que se ganaron sus puestos vía meritocracia. Glad to have him as SOS!

8580 2018-02-19 02:04:02 My skin is super oily too and coconut oil helped a lot surprisingly. I’ve been reading a lot about how it’s not really that great for your skin but like I said it really depends on the person.
8581 2018-02-19 02:03:56 Fought a spider for 3 hours one day. I was totally at war armed with lavender and lemon essential oil sprays terrified because it was jumping, my nephew walks in slams his crutch down and says, Auntie there was huge spider in your house. 🖒

8583 2018-02-19 02:03:32 Donnie, now you know what the snake oil salesman felt like in the old west when the sheriff was about to lock him up.  Can’t happen fast enough.

8592 2018-02-19 02:01:38 Ughhh skincare can be so hard. Everyone is different. I would just suggest switching up your routine until you find something that works. I know that doesn’t help much but idk I used just coconut oil for a long time to help my breakouts until my skin finally cleared up

8600 2018-02-19 02:00:47 Williams oil is the only way to go doing investment. It is reliable and comfortable with a huge ROI in just three months at least. It comes with a unique state-of-the-act for tracking your investment.

8612 2018-02-19 01:59:01 I think a lot of the heat in the replies is due to an ambiguous idea of how we measure “energy” amongst different sources. Like how do we actually compare solar panels to barrels of oil? Or barrels of oil to nuclear reactors? And then how do we make a percentage off of that?
8613 2018-02-19 01:58:57 Been putting olive oil & raw egg in my hair every 2 weeks & my hair is flourishingggggggg

8617 2018-02-19 01:58:24 C'mon. Of course I'm terrified. I'm simply holding Ds accountable. Too many big oil, Pharma, dark money rotten apples in this *now* corporate party. Fracking, tons I can push to change. Of course, Rs are more corrupt. But Democrats lying, punching left is never okay, is it?
8618 2018-02-19 01:58:22 Leftist media probably not showing because socialism failure  I’m not sure if many Americans want seeing it.Recently  State Department refused to buy oil from them also
8619 2018-02-19 01:58:20 Thanks for the programming reminder. I’ll be burning the midnight oil tuning in. #TeamUSA
8620 2018-02-19 01:58:13 (Oh, you can use mayo in place of oil if you like. That's the way my mom made it.)
8621 2018-02-19 01:58:11 Neal Huntington is a total snake oil salesman! They need to be proactive if they want to win. They've sat on their hands!
8622 2018-02-19 01:57:40 I’m gonna tell you a secret: you’ve been making popcorn wrong your whole life.
Pan with lid. Coconut oil. Kernels covering the bottom in a single layer. Heat on below-medium for a longer time. Perfect texture.
Flavoring: nutritional yeast. Tajin is amazing, tangy. Or Shiso fume.

8632 2018-02-19 01:56:32 It's been a while but we used a coconut oil roasted oats and pumpkin seeds. It was fine if kept in fridge but the coconut has a low melt point. Learn from our errors!
8633 2018-02-19 01:56:23 Instead of stifling growth in US, Canada, and other places where oil is hard to extract, low oil prices forced companies to invest in technological efficiency, producing new advances in directional drilling, etc. Now we have lower overhead costs combined with higher oil prices.2/
8634 2018-02-19 01:56:13 why is jojoba oil so expensive
8635 2018-02-19 01:56:11 Peace & Calming® essential oil is a gentle, sweet blend of Ylang Ylang, Orange, Tangerine, Patchouli, and Blue Tansy. This fragrant oil is a wonderful addition to your meditation, evening routine, or playtime with the kids....the carrier oil is coconut.
8636 2018-02-19 01:56:01 What could happen if we do away with it. I come from a country who's citizens had no rights. I love this country because of those rights. The Founding Fathers of this country knew how important it is. The first thing King George decreed was to confiscate all guns and gun powder.
8637 2018-02-19 01:55:53 Psst! Wanna hear another marine oil spill expert secret? Get ready for it: It’s not ‘when’ one happens, but ‘if’ one does, where is it, what type of oil is involved, how much spilled, what are the weather conditions, where is it headed and how the hell are we gonna clean it up?
8638 2018-02-19 01:55:53 I've been thinking about this, Ken. Information is the new oil which is why billions are spent annually by every govt, seeking ways to manipulate info to control behavior. It becomes a double edged sword when their targets become aware of this & are empowered by it.
8639 2018-02-19 01:55:41 Nutox sda ada cleansing oil, essence n cc cream yg available d watson ldu. But the price thoooooo

8643 2018-02-19 01:54:24 No actually - there has been sensible federal gun legislation before and there can be again. Also, 2A is an AMENDMENT, so yes, constitutional change is possible.
8644 2018-02-19 01:54:17 I agree that 'mental illness' is too broad a term to use without warnings including specifics in illness or behavioral cues. I am also concerned that the peer/neighbor/classmate reporting is fragile and ripe for abuse.
8645 2018-02-19 01:54:04 I don’t care if kinder wants to transport refined Canadian oil to Asian. What I don’t want is tanker full of heavy chemically treated bitumen to sink off B.C. coast
8646 2018-02-19 01:53:42 Peppermint oil and soaking them in water as hot as you can get it. Also Dr Johnson’s foot bath. Same method.
8647 2018-02-19 01:53:40 watched The Seven Year Itch ft Marilyn Monroe while getting an oil change. movies sure have changed since 1955
8648 2018-02-19 01:53:30 I'm talking the chemist's role here. One of my storage stability tests was on flavour of cod liver oil capsules after 1 yr >
8649 2018-02-19 01:53:12 Like a private fascist army for the oil co. And in the Occupy scenarios - these were under DP administrations. These DP establishment mayors were up on their late-night conference calls, really, conspiring.
8650 2018-02-19 01:53:04 Owning an essential oil diffuser has improved my life in magical ways 
8651 2018-02-19 01:52:51 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
8652 2018-02-19 01:52:40 Load an App called “Oil Price Live”. It will show you the USA price called “WTI” and the Canadian oil price called “West Canadian Select”.  Today WTI is USD$62.30 and West Canadian Select is USD$34.30, a deduction of USD$28.00. So we sell our oil to the US at almost half price!
8653 2018-02-19 01:52:32 Not sure how to react to this honestly. The NRA isn't a government entity so NRA "certification" does not exist. So you obviously know nothing about the NRA. I agree with you otherwise.
8654 2018-02-19 01:52:07 Sa Jerms, Sir. Hahah. Inofferan din kasi ako treatment to kill the dandruffs akala ko plus 100 lang kasi sa isip ko shampoo lang. Hinot oil na pala 
8655 2018-02-19 01:52:06 The science of human caused climate change is accepted as fact by 11,000 current scientists and many more 1000s of past scientists back to 1912. It's far beyond debate or controversy. You can believe the politicians and oil industry. I'll believe the scientists!
8656 2018-02-19 01:51:57 Vetiver essential oil in the bath.....you're welcome
8657 2018-02-19 01:51:57 What a way to get money, first it was #oil companies now #Pharmaceutical companies, who’s next? If he keeps chasing companies there will be increase in unemployment.
8658 2018-02-19 01:51:52 Because it will screw up his oil deal in the Middle East.
8659 2018-02-19 01:51:47 I think the number is the calories in the fish because a few tablespoons of olive oil is like more than what it is supposed to have in the can
8660 2018-02-19 01:51:46 Or oil the smell of oil is the worst
8661 2018-02-19 01:51:44 Plans to release tech that makes oil irrelevant and sinks the petroleum dollar?
8662 2018-02-19 01:51:25 So it was, but then the GOP distributed most of the fruits and public land to the Koch Brothers, oil companies, pipeline creators, mining companies, right wingers carrying rifles and other members of the .001%. #GOPTaxScam
8663 2018-02-19 01:51:25 NRA has the same relationship to the shooter as does my heating oil delivery person to me changing the temp on my thermostat. Get on board with real change. Stop stating facts and idiotic conclusions. You are confusing a lot of people.

8665 2018-02-19 01:50:59 @tednaiman what was that almond oil you recommended
8666 2018-02-19 01:50:49 They believe it because earlier this year @Potus  repealed the mandate to include certain MI and behavioral disorders in background checks.
8667 2018-02-19 01:50:29 It was pretty fucking big. Caused an 04’ Indonesian Tsunami of oil from the pan
8668 2018-02-19 01:50:24 BTW, with dwindling Alaskan oil supplies, WA State & Cali coastal refineries looking for new source. WA State already takes up 50% of current TMP syncrude/bitumen & Cali refineries most of rest. Not China. PS. Since 1977, Alaskan oil supertankers have traveled in BC waters! Sigh.

8670 2018-02-19 01:50:14 I thought the oil was the moisture too, but if the moisture is actually supposed to be water then it kinda makes sense? A lot of  people w nice hair swear by oil and I’m inclined to believe them lol
8671 2018-02-19 01:49:50 Taking a Epsom salt bath with a little coconut oil.  it’s so relaxing and my skin so soft.

8673 2018-02-19 01:49:41 Tell that to the Venezuelan people that right now regret giving up their gun rights. The country that was taken from a vibrant Democracy, to people leaving in masses due to Socialism. Do not mistake those that believe in the second amendment for being heartless, they just fear
8674 2018-02-19 01:49:18 It was probably a "gift" from the oil and gas industry

8679 2018-02-19 01:48:49 if it wanted olive oil, itd say olive oil.  not vegetable
8680 2018-02-19 01:48:37 Because the price of oil dropped due to lower global demand accompanied by massive production increases by OPEC, mainly Saudi Arabia. This was intended to make shale oil and fracking prohibitively expensive and shut down. But it backfired. 1/
8681 2018-02-19 01:48:21 It's about controlling both oil price & market access. As well as maintenance of the dollar as reserve currency by basing it on oil reserves. Note this strategy is not long teerm sustainable but Trump is probably unaware.
8682 2018-02-19 01:47:58 Olives are vegetables. Therefore olive oil is vegetable oil. Am I right or am I right?
8683 2018-02-19 01:47:57 Get peppermint oil on hands, rubs eye*...soo this is how I become blind

8685 2018-02-19 01:47:54 SC I’d love  to wash ur back for u..an rub u down with the oil massage
8686 2018-02-19 01:47:33 I think a lot of us in BC, don't see this risk worth zero reward. Oil is a dying industry, and we're shipping a raw product. We should be refining it and consuming in our country to justify this risk. @RachelNotley should be pushing for refining, not shipping.
8687 2018-02-19 01:47:33 We are all idiots for not having you tell her it is an “essential oil”. Moms flip their wig over that more than vitamins, even!
8688 2018-02-19 01:47:29 When someone proclaims to have the 'cure' to literally every possible health condition in the world?  That's how you know they are selling snake oil.  Please move along; you'll find no takers here.
8689 2018-02-19 01:47:23 90’s...?  That was the late 70’s and early 80’s for me.  Sun In and Hawaiian Tropic Tanning Oil.  Roasted like a turkey with perfect tan lines... have the sun damaged spots to prove it.
8690 2018-02-19 01:46:34 Wouldn't it be great if we all had solar panels and when the victor of the fighting for this oil field tries to sell it we told them we don't want it. Keep it!
8691 2018-02-19 01:46:21 Ok I need to try that. My fav is either roasted w/ olive oil or pan-fried until caramelized. What an underrated veggie.
8692 2018-02-19 01:46:06 Nope. I think it’s Rexxon “my word is my bond” Tillerson. Think of it. He is good friends with Putin and knows his way around the world . He’s a calm dude and knows his oil, too. Orrin went all crazy last year and would be horrible at this point. He lost it. Anyway ... 
8693 2018-02-19 01:45:34 Oops! Almost forgot my c. 2006 PPP on BC marine oil spill threats, presented to my marine search and rescue colleagues at the time, from @rcmsar33, meeting at the @RVYClub.
8694 2018-02-19 01:45:23 Don't forget sunscreen! They really help prevent further darkening of the scars and its real good! And I don't know whether you heard about this, but this product (Innisfree no sebum powder), just apply it on your face after your skincare, and it will prevent oil on your face :)

8702 2018-02-19 01:44:53 Wait, Canada has oil and communism, right? And they ARE basically French, so they should just roll over, yeah? The parts that are mainly British? Well, THEY know what happened the last time they tried to tango...
8703 2018-02-19 01:44:52 Nope, it wants to control the oil price not the USD trade value.

8705 2018-02-19 01:44:47 PAY OUT OF YOUR POCKET @ScottPruittOK - You are destroying the environment and are a BIG OIL stooge so bill THEM.
8706 2018-02-19 01:44:41 A friend uses aloe vera gel, witch hazel, and tea tree oil (equal parts gel/wh/10 drops oil). It's not oily. I use a coconut mask but I have really long hair and only use a couple Tbsp with about 10 drops tea tree oil and a Tbsp of jojoba or argan oil. Too much is hard to remove.
8707 2018-02-19 01:44:30 Changing oil herself nah 
8708 2018-02-19 01:44:25 It's a deliberate policy to keep the people disunited and impoverished,so they can not fight for their rights.This is to enable the plundering of their resources to continue,while shifting Governmental decision making to Abuja,and the oil and gas business to Lagos.Real cruelty
8709 2018-02-19 01:43:37 Spilt the cooking oil all over the shelf ami is going to kill me very soon :)
8710 2018-02-19 01:43:37 Find me a credible scientist who lives in a home powered by solar panels and drives a smart car and maybe I’ll change my view. And by the way the device your using to argue with me is made using “dirty” oil that according to Suzuki we need to leave in the ground.
8711 2018-02-19 01:43:32 Bro they did  peep them crawling before the oil.... some things I just don't get 
8712 2018-02-19 01:43:24 ไม่รู้ว่ามันเรียกว่าอะไร?
แต่ที่รู้ๆคือขาดไปไม่ได้แล้ว....
8713 2018-02-19 01:43:08 If the economy was improving during the Obama era why did the US oil industry nearly collapse? Your world view is not consistent with reality. Obama's economy was stagnant. It's the reason Trump won.
8714 2018-02-19 01:43:04 I was just asked “where’s that purple?” I reply “what?” Lavender. The man was looking for lavender oil. 
8715 2018-02-19 01:42:51 Whisk egg yolk with a tablespoon of olive oil and leave on hair for a few minutes before your shampoo. It makes a great hair conditioner.

8717 2018-02-19 01:42:39 ..I am sorry if the orig tweet looked like a direct correlation - not my intention. This is like an oil spill in the arctic - questions have to be...was there a reasonable way of predicting or preventing this ? Were there reasons to be particularly vigilant? Should FB have known
8718 2018-02-19 01:42:29 Correct.  CNY oil and CNY gold contracts mean China will be able to control China's current account balance AND the int'l trade value of the USD thru the gold/oil ratio.
8719 2018-02-19 01:42:23 Call me crazy but running an essential oil diffuser with Stress Away may be the best thing I’ve ever done...
8720 2018-02-19 01:42:21 Never gonna happen. They are all owned by the nra, Big Pharm and the oil and weapons industries
8721 2018-02-19 01:42:18 Is olive oil essential? Because I use a lot of that.
8722 2018-02-19 01:42:03 that oil diffuser definitely gon be on tonight.

8724 2018-02-19 01:41:30 First time we’ve ever lost because we hit a blind oil slick going into showcase #wtf #straighttothebarrier
8725 2018-02-19 01:41:14 If you don’t want the “high”, you should try CBD. Which I’m sure you know the info on it but I used capsules from Cured Nutrition as well as the oil to help me sleep & they really help with anxiety and overall mood so that’s def something to look into
8726 2018-02-19 01:41:13 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!

8729 2018-02-19 01:40:47 Convention takeaways: oil, but also, no oil. Free Palestine, but also, status quo of Bibi’s far right. Save NAFTA, but no to free trade.

8734 2018-02-19 01:40:10 Yes even though it is not a political map; this was created by the BMA, British Military Administration and could be one of reasons why Misrata all of a sudden ?! wants Sirte (along with the oil)

8737 2018-02-19 01:40:04 Yup. And when the pumps to the oil tanker breaks free and oil leaks into the harbor. And when the oil tanker kills a pod of Orca going along the Salish Sea. And when the oil tanker itself crashes into the coast cause in spite of the storm warning they just have to meet a schedule
8738 2018-02-19 01:39:56 Maybe Orin Hatch? Too senile to do harm??? Is their a patriot left in the Grand Oil Party?

8741 2018-02-19 01:39:34 Is anyone minding the "global store?" 
Here are the top countries with the biggest proven oil reserves, as reported by EIA.

1. VENEZUELA
Proven oil reserves in 2013 (billion barrels): 297.6. Total oil supply in 2012 (thousand barrels per day): 2,489.2
8742 2018-02-19 01:39:15 YES. China is trying to control the USD oil price, not replace the USD with the CNY. US knows this btw - energy dominance ambition is also about controlling oil price. Trade war.
8743 2018-02-19 01:38:51 Somebody please get Lebron some Black Castor Oil smh
8744 2018-02-19 01:38:44 What if Syria hands its gas and oil resources to Russia in exchange for rebuilding funds. Almost like what the british had with Iran but not giving anything back.
8745 2018-02-19 01:38:37 Avocado oil all year long will help keep the shine and moisture for her scalp and it won't attract bugs in the summer & it can be used as a bod moustizer.

8748 2018-02-19 01:38:23 Hemp oil or CBD oil is legal in all 50 states, as it contains essentially none of the intoxicating element of marijuana, called THC (<0.3%).

The stores should band together to sue Rutherford County and the sheriff's office immediately. They would win!
8749 2018-02-19 01:38:11 #til people used the word "virgin" exclusively for young women or maidens before they started using it for other things like olive oil or just to mean 'uninitiated'
8750 2018-02-19 01:38:11 Hell yea like oil changes tires and I stayyyyy catching a flat 
8751 2018-02-19 01:38:10 Probably, but I also take other measures that promote it (I sleep in a silk bonnet and I oil my scalp with JBCO regularly which coincidentally helps the dry scalp this dry ass desert fosters).
8752 2018-02-19 01:37:46 g coconut oil is a sealant. bitches be walking around greasy as fuck tb they glowing lmfaooo yea ok

8758 2018-02-19 01:35:43 So my mom surprised me with a diffuser today, which is great, but she then handed me some menopause essential oil to go with it. Idk how to feel about it.
8759 2018-02-19 01:35:40 We are not getting tax handouts in Alberta for the oil industry. We sell our oil at half the world price to the USA.  Bombardier gets handouts.  In oil business. Doesn’t cost more to drill here than the ME.  If the oil industry was in Quebec the government would be susidizing.
8760 2018-02-19 01:35:37 It never ceases to amaze me that this snake oil salesman wriggled his way into the White House. 

Simultaneously our greatest national embarrassment and our greatest threat to national security.

8764 2018-02-19 01:35:25 Youth of America... this is YOUR time!  You need to mobilize by the millions.  Fight against USA wars-for-oil, gun violence.  Fight FOR human rights, migrant rights, peace and planet.  Survivors of the FL school shooting announce a nationwide, march 3/24 to push for gun control
8765 2018-02-19 01:35:13 Or be conscripted.
8766 2018-02-19 01:35:13 It never ceases to amaze me that this snake oil salesman wriggled his way into the White House. 

Simultaneously our greatest national embarrassment and our greatest threat to national security.
8767 2018-02-19 01:34:50 And let me guess....the topic must be OIL! The only thing that gets his attention.
8768 2018-02-19 01:34:41 And the gulf coast would quickly learn that "living below sea level" is dumb and stop it.

And Texas would just sell oil.

I actually thing the gulf and Midwest would do better without the west coast.

8784 2018-02-19 01:31:24 nah I've never used coconut oil. Maybe the oils I tried were to heavy.  I can't even remember what I tried because I run from oils like the plague   Except for my body and hair.

8802 2018-02-19 01:28:31 Rex is a moron in the true sense of the word. There is only one industry he could have succeeded in oil which is populated by some of the lowest level of business people.

Oh yes economic interests, capitalism
8807 2018-02-19 01:26:18 Need to get an oil change Thursday, long overdue
8808 2018-02-19 01:25:48 @WhiteHouse It can work out great if Gasoline prices get speculation taken out, about 35-70 cents per gallon on average. @POTUS would had to go after Oil+Gas Hedge Funds & intermediaries, very difficult job, no 1 has done it in last 70 years, it could be done. Congress corrupt.
8809 2018-02-19 01:25:47 Even with a pipeline to water, the process of extracting our oil is far more cumbersome than say in the middle east. If the price per barrel was still above $100 than sure we could do without tax handouts but as the market stands, it cannot.
8810 2018-02-19 01:24:35 also, that if the children they cry over today were killed in the womb they'd be celebrating "choice".
8811 2018-02-19 01:24:28 garlic, olive oil, salt & red pepper flakes, then cook on medium-high heat and mix frequently until you think it's done? it depends on how well done your like your broccoli. imo it's best if the broccoli is pretty dry? otherwise the water leaks out and it just starts boiling!
8812 2018-02-19 01:24:24 "Leave the oil in the ground", say the paid for protesters. 

"Good job, you saved the planet" say the elite.

"Prepare the long term plans", say the multinationals.

"Take down borders" say the globalists, as they dismantle obstacles to their quest.

Maybe NOT, say the people!
8813 2018-02-19 01:24:22 You know what the amazing thing is? This freaking China oil contract is only 35 days out (unless they change it again as they have for the last two years)..we will know soon enough what happens...then we can all stop talking about it after some one says "I told ya so" obs
8814 2018-02-19 01:24:17 @JerryBrownGov Zero Emissions?  There's a power plant generating emissions somewhere.  The freighter coming over from China with lithium burns bunker oil for a month to get here.  The battery making process takes a bunch of electricity.  And what IS the to handle old batteries?
8815 2018-02-19 01:24:06 lol at least oil kills the planet to *increase* their funds

8818 2018-02-19 01:23:13 Bombardier is a loser of a company. Oil and gas industry doesn’t need subsidies. We need a pipeline to tide water. Governments need to get out of the way.

8822 2018-02-19 01:22:38 So, you accept facts unless they lead to a logical conclusion that would affect your sacred oil extraction?

8828 2018-02-19 01:21:42 Even if EVs replace gasoline vehicles, there is still a substantial amount of oil required for a variety of applications involved in manufacturing them. Refined gasoline might tank, but you're only looking at part of the picture.

8838 2018-02-19 01:20:01 Oilfield being "busy" now is due to global supply/demand of oil and technological advances which make extraction more efficient. Has nothing to do with trump. All he did was approve #DAPL which has virtually no impact. You probably think Dear Leader makes the sun rise and set.

8849 2018-02-19 01:17:16 Triffin Dilemma would not be an issue if China was willing to settle any CNY imbalances created thru oil trade w/a neutral reserve asset.  Which is probably why China's been buying so much gold & set up int'l CNY gold contracts in Shanghai, HK, & Dubai.

8853 2018-02-19 01:16:27 For a Canadian addicted to tar sand extraction, anything suggesting we should be ending the oil era “goes off the rational rails”?

8885 2018-02-19 01:11:36 It belongs to the community, these animals have no right to destroy this benefit. Solar is excellent choice for a desert country, yes even for a hospital. Coal and oil are great, if you have them, if not, solar can ease the cost of imports.
8886 2018-02-19 01:11:21 You voted for big oil and against protecting the environment. You knowingly made it harder for a lot of people to get quality health care. You enable an unstable, misogynistic bigot who has no respect for women or for the less fortunate. You're now doing a lot more harm than good

8909 2018-02-19 01:08:54 Yes there is for cannabis so I presume for cannibals oil too? People travel to states in US where its legal for treatment for their children. Can't point you to the paper but it is known to be very effective in some forms of epilepsy.
8910 2018-02-19 01:08:50 Maybe we should start processing bitumen in Canada to not need to import oil products. This, even before laying down more pipelines.

8912 2018-02-19 01:08:35 Bush 1 had done much biz with Bahrain as a private citizen (Zapata oil co.) and achieved an agreement from Arab nations to cut off gas to the US, increasing the pressure on Carter
8913 2018-02-19 01:08:31 Yes, Russia's goal is for America to go energy independent and provide Europe with natural gas which undermines Russia's primary export: energy.

By next year, we'll be pumping more oil than Saudi Arabia or Russia.

This hurts them profoundly.

But keep espousing your nonsense.
8914 2018-02-19 01:08:20 Coconut oil is my best friend

8920 2018-02-19 01:07:00 Coal is just one example of fossil fuel use, oil to drives our technology.
8921 2018-02-19 01:06:59 Using oil has resulted in excessive waste in the Gulf of Mexico, excessive fracking in Oklahoma  and keeps loading the pockets of the top 1%. Instead offering any solutions to when oil runs out Big Oil is building more refiners and laws preventing non-polluting technology
8922 2018-02-19 01:06:46 My point is that if you think the NRA is buying off politicians you're crazy. NRA isn't even in the top 50 donors. If anyone is buying off politicians it's Green energy, oil companies, pharma, and unions.
8923 2018-02-19 01:06:45 I bet she squirt motor oil

8926 2018-02-19 01:06:24 Of course we would be happy to refine oil in Canada, if you will pay for a refinery.  It would be a nice token from B.C. to help address B.C.'s concerns.  We've been trying to get oil companies to build refineries for years, but they want to use their existing ones in Texas.
8927 2018-02-19 01:06:21 Awesome I’m about due for an oil change in my car!
8928 2018-02-19 01:06:18 Way more important to build a winning culture. Hate the tanking crap. Tanking for years has got the oil one playoff. Always play to win
8929 2018-02-19 01:06:17 I need to change my skincare! Advice? I have mix oil x dry skin.
8930 2018-02-19 01:06:03 Not really, if it's the same oil it's gonna contain traces of anything that's been in before. Could make someone's allergies flare up. Veg and meat dishes are supposed to be separate for a reason or cooking appliances cleaned to stop contamination
8931 2018-02-19 01:05:53 Uncertainty plays crucial role. In 2015 there were lot of uncertainties about oil, fed, rates, earnings etc and markets didn't like it. Certainty overcomes technicals IMO. As of now markets are certain about future IMO.
8932 2018-02-19 01:05:50 Argan oil or Shea butter
8933 2018-02-19 01:05:47 That's how flawed and simplistic your assumptions are. The claim that Democratic policies are "job killers" in the fossil fuel industry is garbage propaganda from Cramer's Big Oil donors. Environmental protections and higher corporate taxes do NOT hurt my salary or job security.
8934 2018-02-19 01:05:46 maybe I am not getting this, but if CNY is not convertible, why would anyone accept it in payment for oil and food? CNY must be convertible or there will be no market, and that has serious implications for China's economic policy #Triffindilemma
8935 2018-02-19 01:05:45 Libya. So sickening. You can’t believe everything you see on YouTube but I did see a documentary claiming that Momar Qaddafi made sure all citizens actually had a home and oil revenue money.
8936 2018-02-19 01:05:44 You tried comparing two vastly different countries to prove what? Different cultures, different people, etc. You’re worse than Trump, trying to sell snake oil and claiming it’s something else. Problem is, nobody’s buying.
8937 2018-02-19 01:05:27 I don't give money to any church. My faith is the Primary Christian Faith. We believe in giving the Holy oil to the sick as Jesus and his disciples did. We have been lied to by these evil people. We need cannabis buds to make Holy oil and heal the sick. And so I fight.
8938 2018-02-19 01:05:05 Also if you have ever heard of castor oil I use that on my skin as a moisturizer/ add some to my foundation for a glowy look!! It’s helps with hair too so I use on eyebrows/eyelashes

8945 2018-02-19 01:03:59 what makes me physically ill reading this is that past Cannabis oil use has helped improve this child's life greatly and the Government STILL Refuses. Over 3000 seizures A DAY! How heartless. It is inconceivable.
8946 2018-02-19 01:03:32 I really don't care. Keep your oil. The AB govt can put this petition out and I can stand against it whenever they promote it. I do not believe this pipeline is a way we can create a better future. #StopABPipeline #BlockABPipeline #StopKM
8947 2018-02-19 01:03:23 Currently sitting on the floor of the most immaculate shower I’ve ever been in letting my dry ass legs soak in baby oil, I don’t think my Sunday could get any better.
8948 2018-02-19 01:03:10 Indeed, I don't know any actual progressives who'd consider @JustinTrudeau a progressive. Trudeau's a neo-liberal/conservative who utters progressive-sounding words. Trudeau sees his job as protecting corporations, in particular oil companies, from Canadian citizens.
8949 2018-02-19 01:02:56 ..."Jesus came to bring us hope in the darkest of circumstances"

Lord, our hearts hurt when we hear about the pain and suffering that some endure. Have mercy we pray.

He who bestows the oil of joy instead of mourning gives us hope even in the midst of the darkest of situations.

If I as a corporation donate $$$ to politicians, it’s my way - while as an individual my voice hardly matters if I don’t agree!
Example - healthcarestill private, oil companies don’t want solar & wind!
8955 2018-02-19 01:02:09 Yeah, but Lucic is immovable. Why continue to put him on Draisaitl's wing when Lucic has zero finish? Puljüjarvi should be RW for Draisaitl, since Drai is the best passer on the Oil.

8976 2018-02-19 00:58:41 Changing my oil. Forehead was itchy. Forgot oil was on my hands. Oil now all over my face.

8978 2018-02-19 00:58:35 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
8979 2018-02-19 00:58:06 I want an oil diffuser!!!!!
8980 2018-02-19 00:57:59 Rancid coconut oil
8981 2018-02-19 00:57:43 Once the means of production ie oil, mining, factories etc  are in the hands of the government and if the army are on their side you get dictatorship and tyranny. It’s easy to slip into socialism but almost impossible to get out of it.
8982 2018-02-19 00:57:29 Does it still contain peanut butter? or just random container? I guess oil goes rancid, but I'd give it a go.
8983 2018-02-19 00:57:28 Would you rather put something that would end all cost of power in place for forever or would you like to keep paying the Middle East for oil that will run out?
8984 2018-02-19 00:57:28 Snake oil salesman since the time he sang Tutti Frutti for white audiences.
8985 2018-02-19 00:57:26 Well, its not like the sector is short on drilling rigs, is it?  I'd guess it will remain a survivor, although that is predicated on long term oil upside.
8986 2018-02-19 00:57:20 Didn't your mother, gm, nanny, use oil?
8987 2018-02-19 00:57:03 Whats missing in this articule is lost resource revenue on royalities for saskatchewan and alberta  residents. As well as all the support jobs this pipe line and oil industry generates. So bc its time to build that pipe line and start acting like you are part of this country.
8988 2018-02-19 00:57:02 Cooking tip o' the night! Cut brussel sprouts in half, toss w/a bit of salt & oil, roast the bejesus out of 'em at 450 for 30+ min. When dark & toasty, toss w/a few splashes of mirin, pinch o' sugar, juice from half a lime, and some dashes of fish sauce. MMM!
8989 2018-02-19 00:56:59 I bought beard oil and beard conditioner today.. big step. Most commitment I’ve shown in years tbh
8990 2018-02-19 00:56:38 There are lots of pro gun votes who think a few dead kids is a small price to pay for their hobby.
8991 2018-02-19 00:56:35 I am also a lifelong BC resident and am aware we just occupy the land for a short time. The risk of oil spills is too much for an environmentally weak resource. The ‘jobs’ issue is a myth. Focus on real job creation with long lasting results
8992 2018-02-19 00:56:31 Try clove/eugenol oil from rite aid or CVS. Works wonders
8993 2018-02-19 00:56:29 Primary energy but that will change when big oil dies with shift to EVs. The story for electricity generation is incredibly positive even from IEA.

9006 2018-02-19 00:53:27 Used to use rosehip but it didn't absorb into my skin and make look a hot greasy mess. Now I use Marula oil by Drunk Elephant.

9008 2018-02-19 00:52:49 Flipping around Netflix this weekend, looking for some escape from politics. Clicked on a recent Woody Woodpecker animated feature. We weren't 5 minutes in, and they had already tackled the evils of hunting and introduced their main villain - "Big Oil." Even kids' movies. 
9009 2018-02-19 00:52:43 How did she become the nomination, twice, to represent the Green Party?

Standing in Moscow wearing her fur coat, meeting with PUtin, and being invested in defense & oil should disqualify her. 

Green Party needs to get its act together.
9010 2018-02-19 00:52:37 ...and the Obama and Hillary petroleum policies favored a high priced Russian oil
9011 2018-02-19 00:52:32 Yes,I know.
This is Japanese food"Ebifurai"
I brought the shrimp with bread crumbs and gave it as oil.
9012 2018-02-19 00:52:28 I’m so thankful for weed and oil like they can take away my anxiety in 10 minutes. No person could do that for me

9018 2018-02-19 00:51:41 My high-level Iranian contacts have said for years that China has been short of dollars & still settle accumulated dollar obligations to Iran in goods & services whenever possible. No surprise China prefers oil payment obligations to be denominated in Yuan rather than $

9020 2018-02-19 00:51:24 Coming from the person that doesn’t read his daily briefings. 
He has to have them read to him because he can’t read, shows anyone selling snake oil can be President
9021 2018-02-19 00:51:20 Who can deliver me oil south Miami!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
9022 2018-02-19 00:51:18 If you (a Gulf coast refinery) take delivery of imported oil at LOOP, it all makes sense I think. You get a blend of Gulf of Mexico & Middle East crudes, which must be very common.
9023 2018-02-19 00:51:14 EBay! !
9024 2018-02-19 00:51:03 It's how Dems got people to vote for a war mongering, pro fracking, big oil & big pharma, interventionist who scammed voters with public positions for the masses & private positions for her donors.  So the gullible can be cultivated. That's the only thing there's actual proof of.
9025 2018-02-19 00:50:59 Idk why I read that as tee tree oil 
9026 2018-02-19 00:50:50 They're selling cannabis oil at holland and Barrett and apparently it helps with anxiety and joint/muscle pains without making you high

9031 2018-02-19 00:50:00 i poured a bit of 350 degree oil down the sink without thinking so uhhhhhh here's hoping i didn't destroy our plumbing
9032 2018-02-19 00:49:59 I always use olive oil, garlic, and some lemon juice, lemon pepper is pretty good on it too.  Either sauteed or steamed works best.  Steamed tends to be more tender.
9033 2018-02-19 00:49:57 Talk about looking a gift horse in the mouth. A booming economy is bad for canada? There are so many other reasons for the rising Can dollar at that time, as well as the reduction in manufacturing in ontario. To blame it on oil is typical Tides BS. From a CBC reporter. Nuff said
9034 2018-02-19 00:49:38 I have no idea honestly I’ve never been asked lol. Um...I rarely if ever break out and my skin isn’t very oily as compared to my sister where she can take tissue and you can see the oil on it when she pats her face. Does that help? Lol
9035 2018-02-19 00:49:36 Mic 6:7 - Should we offer him thousands of rams and ten thousand rivers of olive oil? Should we sacrifice our firstborn children to pay for our sins?
9036 2018-02-19 00:49:24 I LOVE THAT, AND THE TEE TO! 
9037 2018-02-19 00:49:11 So yeah you'd cut down on numbers. But I don't think it would solve the problem. And even if you make it next to impossible to get a gun, I think people would find a way around it. Just like bootleggers did. And cars require gas and oil, so it's easier than horses but similar.
9038 2018-02-19 00:49:08 #JamesWoolsey  on CNN made a fool of self, claimed "It does not matter what Trump says", has oil price fetish, says to respond to Russian election  interference to let people to switch fuels in cars to drive down the price of oil, which would hurt Russia

We see the climate change
9042 2018-02-19 00:48:56 Better for you than sugar too, win win. I originally started making bread with butter until I made Greek village bread (horiatiko psomi) which uses olive oil and honey, yum yum and more or less what I just sent you, oil is much quicker than butter.
9043 2018-02-19 00:48:43 IDK IF U MEAN THAT IN A GOOD WAY OR NOT sry if i jsut gave u info u can never unlearn. im p sure the oil is what gives it flavors like strawberry n stuff but maybe theres a separate flavoring for that too? it sounds yummy
9044 2018-02-19 00:48:40 A company I purchased rosehip oil from emailed me to ask if I received my order and how I was liking it. I told them I loved it so far but unfortunately, I spilled 3/4 of it. They sent me a coupon code for $10 off....the product is only $12!  A+ customer service! 
9045 2018-02-19 00:48:36 She looked very nervous... almost manic on the political shows this weekend. Even if there wasn't a Russian connection, the woman is a grifter with investments in oil spending her time making a living repeatedly unsuccessfully running for president. Grifter.
9046 2018-02-19 00:48:12 Yes,I know.
This is "Ebifurai".It is Japanese food.

9049 2018-02-19 00:46:56 When capitalism is king, we were bound to get a snake oil salesman.
9050 2018-02-19 00:46:37 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
9051 2018-02-19 00:46:10 Extra virgin olive oil and a little bit of soap usually cleans my brushes and sponges really well!
9052 2018-02-19 00:45:50 The pipeline companies wash their hands of the responsibility for the dilbit/oil once it reaches tidewater. From that point it is handled by tanker fleets under flags of convenience. That means any spill at sea will not have a responsible party to go after. Canada/BC $$$$
9053 2018-02-19 00:45:50 Can anyone recommend any good oil diffusers? I need to chillax yo. 
9054 2018-02-19 00:45:47 Combine 4 tsps hot dogs with 9 oz cookies. Mix in Olive Oil. Stir-fry. Serve warm.

9060 2018-02-19 00:44:25 Today I took my car for an oil change, did laundry, and filed my taxes. This week, we are hopefully doing the final walkthrough on our house. Adult life, man. It's a weird time.
9061 2018-02-19 00:44:02 they pop it in a flavored coconut oil and add a special salt to it called flavacol. ur absolutely right its terrible for u but u can get it rly easily so i'll probably die from it someday
9062 2018-02-19 00:43:58 I played a half orc druid for a campaign that went a few years. Initially, there was a noble savage archetype. But as the game progressed the character developed a love of oil painting and a desire for societal reform of orc culture.
9063 2018-02-19 00:43:50 Gotta go get an oil change in the morning
9064 2018-02-19 00:43:42 “If you prevent us, we prevent you; if you open fire at us, we will open fire,” Nasrallah said.  That's not a threat; it's a warning.  Israel has already claimed and been awarded oil drilling territory in the Mediterranean that is well north of the Israeli-Lebanon border.

9066 2018-02-19 00:43:40 Since the percentage of contributions is a drop in the bucket, maybe it'd be a good idea for the @NRA as a group to stop contributing, and encourage members to contribute individually.

9082 2018-02-19 00:41:47 I still can’t believe I got a bottle of olive oil thrown at me 
9083 2018-02-19 00:41:46 I tend to make the round ones with 500g of flour, 250-300mls of warm water, 1-2tsp yeast, 2tbls oil, 1tsp salt and if I'm feeling decadent a good squeeze of the honey bottle.

How come Columbia or Guyana don’t have the same problems?
…OIL!!! Ooops that. #fumbduck
9086 2018-02-19 00:40:59 Exactly. If it wasn't feasible, and wasn't profitable, there'd be no market! Alberta keeps saying "shut off the taps to BC". Go ahead! It's raw product you're pumping. We get the majority of our oil from Cherry Point refinery in Washington state.
9087 2018-02-19 00:40:59 Hardcore OG oil and some Jack to keep my night calm.
9088 2018-02-19 00:40:52 What amazes me even more is finding out that people I knew would support a snake oil salesman. Even now when more and more proof of his chicanery comes out daily. Not ranting speculation or partisan spin but just provable lies big and small. All the time. Every day.
9089 2018-02-19 00:40:47 I’ve been told that cannabis oil vape pens/e cigs can actually help with anxiety. Is this true?
9090 2018-02-19 00:40:45 Which is the unity of Turkey, they are in a foreign country and they don´t concern. 
Russian isn´t dissapoint of the Pyd and in a dialoge with the YPG like Israel with the Peschmerga (Germany, too). Russia has enough oil and oil is near Palmyra not in this area.
9091 2018-02-19 00:40:20 I'd like to respond to that sarcastically: Yes, I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it.

9099 2018-02-19 00:39:17 A tax is a tax.  The problem is, the subsides go to a few, while the costs go to the many.  Snake oil sales are rising.  Energy poverty will increase.

9105 2018-02-19 00:38:09 if you know imperialist strategies ,don't you recognise, that Russia & Iran are imperialists with own agendas in Syria ?Did you read the facts ,how Russia has already taken over the oil & gas etc.. Assad is medical doctor & Mengele was, it is not the sign of caring of the people
9106 2018-02-19 00:38:05 Finally tried it and........ a big old meh. It's the same oil crap they use to squirt a few stripes on the Nashville hot, just not hot. It's just oil with a few seasonings. NOT BBQ, JUST OIL SQUIRTED ON STRIPS. The old bbq chicken was good, this not so much. What a let down
9107 2018-02-19 00:37:08 Just want a couple oil pen cartridges smh whys it so hard
9108 2018-02-19 00:36:58 oil up
9109 2018-02-19 00:36:57 Life is a big canvas. Given to us blank, and whose hands we allow to sling or stroke the paint or oil on determines our finished portrait. I want to put the brush in God's hands and let Him do what He does best...create!

9110 2018-02-19 00:36:38 Probably gonna oil my scalp tomorrow night and then deep condish overnight. I’ll be in great shape for a ACV rinse Tuesday when I get off work.
9111 2018-02-19 00:36:36 FYI- Ladies!!!!! Coconut oil works as a eye make up remover... Even my  waterproof mascara came off  #coconutoil #makeup #makeupremover
9112 2018-02-19 00:36:20 「そだねー、そだねー（甲高い声）」と相槌を打ち、「でもそんなキミがいいよ、いいよ！（甲高い声）」と励まし、「ヤーップ、ヤーップ、ヤーーーーーップ！（甲高い声）」と叫びながら頭皮をマッサージしてあげる。　＞RT
9113 2018-02-19 00:35:59 Yeah it’s really good. Smells great and is very much like Argan oil. Rich in fatty acids so good for dry hair and split ends
9114 2018-02-19 00:35:58 Did my scalp massage with my essential oil. And scrunched oil on my ends.  I’m doing really well with my schedule this week.
9115 2018-02-19 00:35:45 About to beat off with coconut oil.
9116 2018-02-19 00:34:59 No other nation on the planet has 1) Massive twin deficits, 2). Massive entitlement liabilities, 3). The global reserve currency to lose.  4) A 50-yr monopoly on oil/commodity settlement to lose.  There are no comparisons to the US, we are, as we like to say, exceptional.
9117 2018-02-19 00:34:55 Castor oil is heaven sent
9118 2018-02-19 00:34:47 Sodium citrate is an emulsifier that prevents cheese splitting. You end up with very gooey texture on cheese. For a lasagne I think that is pretty desirable. Non vegans achieve this with mozzarella. Might not work in the same way on oil from cashews and water.
9119 2018-02-19 00:34:29 Brava listeners, mengawali Sport Updates hari ini. Tottenham Hotspur gagal menang di laga babak kelima Piala FA, saat melawan Rochdale.

9120 2018-02-19 00:34:01 Oil spills has everything to do with the discussion.
Notley is spewing how the pipe is in Canada's interest. When a spill happens it will be "BC's Oil Spill" We know how Alberta thinks. "The cost of doing business."
TransCan maintenance record is a joke. Spill is inevitable

9123 2018-02-19 00:33:53 My boyfriend personally changes my oil and rotate's my tires when needed. I love my car mechanic 
9124 2018-02-19 00:33:36 That sounds so interesting. I didn’t even know there’s cactus oil in the first place.
9125 2018-02-19 00:33:32 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
9126 2018-02-19 00:33:32 once the 45th president cries about #CNN being unfair, Mitch Mcconnell writes a song about #love
9127 2018-02-19 00:33:32 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
9128 2018-02-19 00:33:32 Real point?  You and your NRA ass kissing, gun oil sniffin, obstructionist, false flag waving, party are at the root THE PROBLEM.
Now, quit gaslighting and start calling your NRA reps to tell them, come November the youth in this country are saying #NeverAgain
9129 2018-02-19 00:32:18 I made a combo of Cactus oil, almond, coconut, extra virgin olive and black seed. It’s doing good to my hair. But it’s a slow process
9130 2018-02-19 00:32:14 Wanna help? Ask the USA to stop paying $40 Million Cash, per day, for Venezuelan heavy oil. No one else would,  so the Genocidal Tyranny would quickly fall.
9131 2018-02-19 00:31:55 Oil diffuser one of the best household items I’ve invested in. So much so that we have two.
9132 2018-02-19 00:31:55 Whale Oil Beef Hooked (say it in an Irish voice)
9133 2018-02-19 00:31:53 When you want to get up but find that one of your legs has swollen since you were asleep and feels painful to just walk it. Hope that's not a sign for thrombosis. I love crossing over und my legs during the day, I think the airbed has to do with it, too. Took flaxseed oil, too.
9134 2018-02-19 00:31:46 Big picture, gold is money (durable - with the 4 qualities def. by Aristotle) vs transitory currencies. Allegation is PetroYuan means gold settlement through SGE. Oil then becomes very expensive in currencies w/o metal in volume for settlement.
9135 2018-02-19 00:31:46 The oil company and several contractors. OKC enviornmental also checks in on the process. Should take 48 hours.
9136 2018-02-19 00:31:41 Jill Stein is heavily invested in industries that have benefited greatly from the Trump presidency: Big Defense, Big Oil and Big Finance.

She's a fraud; the only point of her running was to make it easier for Trump to win and help HER bottom line.
9137 2018-02-19 00:31:04 Because if Alaska secedes she will not be able to remain independent alone, despite its oil because too coveted and fragile. She will want to return to her first home

9146 2018-02-19 00:29:26 Those people who have had perfect skin all their lives will come here and tell you to use lemon as a face mask and moisturize with coconut oil. Why evils?!
9147 2018-02-19 00:29:20 Thank you for following I followed you back Dean.
9148 2018-02-19 00:29:18 And, until that happens (as in, clearly not tomorrow), how about we use oil that doesn't come from the middle East? That's a great idea Mark! I know, sometimes I'm full of great ideas! Other times, I'm just using logical thinking when considering someone else's ideas.

9151 2018-02-19 00:28:59 Yes.  If China (biggest oil importer) & Russia/Iran (biggest exporter) agree gold is worth 1,000 bbls of oil/oz in China, gold will flock to China & all that gold Russia & Iran have been buying (Turkish trader, anyone?) will replenish their FX rsvs in oil terms, won't they?  :)

Roast yams, really roast them. When they are done put them under the broiler until they start to blacken.

9172 2018-02-19 00:25:06 You can import enough oil if you re-price gold high enough in barrels/oz to settle the associated deficits...the EU discussed doing exactly this in the 1970s in now de-classified documents

9189 2018-02-19 00:22:00 a couple months ago my dad dropped a knife on his foot (only the handle hit him) and it scared him so he jumped and there was some oil on the ground and he slipped and fell and smashed his wrist and had to drive himself to the hospital one handed because he was home alone

9207 2018-02-19 00:20:07 Gel products are your friend! Both in cleansers and moisturizers. And a toner that doesn’t have alcohol in it. Stripping all the oil from your skin will actually make it produce even more.
9208 2018-02-19 00:20:03 Me neither but I needed an emergency oil change.

1- energy security
2- the value of your  crown jewells, your own oil companies, will drop like a rock.  Since your credit line drops with your reserves and production, you cannot import oil! Even if you print enough to fill the Atlantic ocean

9236 2018-02-19 00:16:20 Pleasure all mine. It's quite bad since we all are affected. USA sneezes and we catch a cold. The uncertainty around the Administration combined with a lower (normalized Oil price) and East moving forward it's position and a weak EU.. So we do need a strong and calm USA.
9237 2018-02-19 00:16:12 The difference between being an environmental activist & an environment friendly politician, is a politician has to deal in reality, in writing legislation that makes sense.

And then The Internet told me that those deterrent sprays are basically vinegar and water and orange essential oil and I have all those things!

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
9251 2018-02-19 00:13:57 You wanna know what dystopia looks like? It looks like an oil man who thinks oil is the future and an unstable man-child wth nuclear weapons negotiating OUR future w/  like minded folk, while proactively avoiding any form of sustainable or evolved thinking that includes everyone.
9252 2018-02-19 00:13:26 The only time I’ve used science irl was last Wednesday when my mum tried to use low cal spray on the pan when we made pancakes but it had an emulsifier in it which I knew would change the consistency of the mix and it stopped the pancakes from frying, so we used olive oil instead

9257 2018-02-19 00:13:15 Action speak louder than words. You can't support Kinder Morgan shipping megatonnes of the dirtiest oil across the world to be burned in other countries, while telling us you're pro environment. And what clean growth you talking about? Where is our EV/solar/wind programs?

9261 2018-02-19 00:11:58 You are so so right. God Bless You. #Yorubas are ingrates & professional saboteurs to the general nigerian populace.  They practically run all the oil installations in #Nigeria outside #NNPC which is the domain of #fulani. That is the #Yoruba's secret pact with #Arewa!#Biafrexit

9265 2018-02-19 00:11:34 There are olive oil stores here, and it’s a California variety, so I’m sure I can hunt some down .
9266 2018-02-19 00:11:17 Western Canadian Select - the kind of oil we sell. It isn't company by company that sets the price. I get the feeling you might be overestimating your knowledge base.

9268 2018-02-19 00:10:58 From wiki: Interesterified fat is an oil where fatty acids have been moved from one triglyceride molecule to another. Done to modify melting point, slow rancidification, create an oil more suitable for deep frying or making margarine with good taste, low saturated fat content.

9277 2018-02-19 00:10:02 @narendramodi liked and engaged with @stephenharper much more than @JustinTrudeau. India was looking forward to buying oil from Canada, which now looks unlikely in the near future. JT bull crap does not go well with Mr. Modi.

9280 2018-02-19 00:09:34 Dunno. I'm not really sure what "Koroneiki" means. I assume the one I get comes from some specific farm (it's a California oil), but I don't know. @soffrittoyyc sells in their own bulk bottles.
9281 2018-02-19 00:09:10 Whoever sells Oil to China for CNY.  Flips contract to CNY Gold, arbs the  "neutral" gold back to whatever currency they want at the "true" value.  Will be ignored till USD devalued or GC in USD revalued.  Period.
9282 2018-02-19 00:09:10 Aaj sar main oil lagaya hai. Bas yehi share kerna tha. It’s been 2.5 years since I’ve moved to the UK but the -50 C weather damage to my hair from Winnipeg still haunts me. #DamagedCurls
9283 2018-02-19 00:09:10 Wrong. It'll sweep across the world like smart phones. Gov'ts are even banning gas cars. Besides EVs dont need to take over before change happens, they just need to change the narrative and oil prices will collapse.
9284 2018-02-19 00:09:06 Tea tree oil and lots of conditioner
9285 2018-02-19 00:09:04 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
9286 2018-02-19 00:08:35 Who needs oil wells when you can print domestic currency for oil?  (Hence why the oil contract is so important.). Finding/Drilling/Pumping is a lot of work & very expensive...
9287 2018-02-19 00:08:22 Girl tell me why I just flat ironed my hair but I got oil in it so it's all stiff 
9288 2018-02-19 00:08:18 Nothing  to do with that oil rig but huge cover up when they planted one on rig Lizzie was due to visit

9293 2018-02-19 00:06:56 I can see Juan de Fuca Strait from my kitchen window. I sail in Gulf Islands. I don't want 7 x oil tankers transiting but I would rather it here than north coast. I can live with TM if they increase rescue tugs but they don't. Ante up, Canada to protect the coast or don't ship.

9295 2018-02-19 00:06:51 Russia is prob doing not much now.

9296 2018-02-19 00:06:51 The Geezer was a Gulf international oil trader.  Def not Freddy.  The Geezer still works in Houston and is quite well known.  In 1980 he saved a Gulf refinery from "running out of oil" and became an in-house legend.  And an a-hole.  Chevron didn't want the Geezer after the buyout
9297 2018-02-19 00:06:46 This timeline is a serious discussions. Goodbye, David.
9298 2018-02-19 00:06:44 You are not getting the pipeline. The sooner you guys come to that realization, the easier it will be. BC doesn't even have to do anything. Technology will collapse oil prices to the point oil sands are not viable

9305 2018-02-19 00:06:08 CNY is not a convertible currency - it's not openly traded on FX mkts (can't easily go fr CNY to USD & back.).  I'm hearing it will be convertible under the oil contract, at some level.  This means oil price differences in CNY may be arbitrage-able, among other potential implic's

9318 2018-02-19 00:04:26 We are being gaslighted by Notley and her Big Oil ilk.
9319 2018-02-19 00:04:09 How is oil doing
9320 2018-02-19 00:04:08 Agreed. Besides do we all forget Jan 2016 when oil crashed to $10? It's recovered since then, but only thanks to production cuts in the middle east. There will be a huge shift to electric cars in the next couple years, which will off set all those cuts. Oil will head back to $10
9321 2018-02-19 00:03:52 still need my oil changed

9324 2018-02-19 00:03:32 Forget coconut oil. Avocado’s the way
9325 2018-02-19 00:03:08 Love this comment. My guess is infosec people are raging against things because they heard a vendor use the words at some point. “Snake oil!” and such.
9326 2018-02-19 00:03:05 Also primrose evening oil is great 
9327 2018-02-19 00:02:57 Whatever your export forecast will end up being for this week (to be reported next week), make sure to add 286Kbpd to it because the Saudi supertanker SHADEN just took off with the first crude oil export out of LOOP. Then again, there's always the Adjustment. OK, good night #OOTT
9328 2018-02-19 00:02:39 #CBD oil has most definitely helped my son’s severe depression, he is pretty much ‘normal’ now. Been taking it since last June. I am no longer on eggshells waiting for ‘that’ call. It also helped my 75y old mum’s restless legs.
9329 2018-02-19 00:02:25 Downward pressure on oil at this point will put upward pressure on US deficits & downward pressure on FX reserves (UST selling) at a time when UST & USD mkt already suffering indigestion.  Fed rate hikes could quickly turn to cuts in 2018...

9344 2018-02-19 00:00:24 Olive, jojoba, and sweet almond oils are all wonderful elixirs for hair. If your hair is thick and heavy, coconut oil works wonders.
