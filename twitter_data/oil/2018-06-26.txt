5 2018-06-26 23:59:09 What's happening now is a result of the FR, UK USA and and their allies deposing Gaddafi and destabilising Libya. The oil crisis is irrelevant at this point, but European govs are to blame. And if NGOs weren't there to meet the migrants, this huge migrant wave would stop.

34 2018-06-26 23:57:59 This is a beautiful picture! I miss The oil field.
35 2018-06-26 23:57:58 The 401Ks will continue to grow.  Economy is hot and more steel is being made in America today because of smart trade decisions.  Once we are self sufficient in steel like we are in oil we can control market with new supplies anytime.
36 2018-06-26 23:57:49 @LouDobbs Mexico has every reason to support illegal emigration!  1) They export their poverty, 2) The U.S. picks up the welfare tab, 3) "Remittances" ($30B per year) contribute more to Mexico's GDP that do Oil Revenues, 4) Mexican emigrants retain their Mexican citizenship!
37 2018-06-26 23:57:46 Chop up some garlic, cut a whole head of cauliflower, throw it in a pan with olive oil, nutritional yeast and steak seasoning... you’ll thank me later.
38 2018-06-26 23:57:43 Stop buying Venezuela oil, Qatar oil and gas, stop buy Iran oil. Buy US oil and KSA oil only. Distinguished the real evil.
39 2018-06-26 23:57:37 republicans: ...and make it more expensive to buy a home, a car, and groceries. You will also need to pay more for renewable energy and we may start allowing companies to drill for oil on public lands, so that they can export more oil.
40 2018-06-26 23:57:32 Weird! After creating the last oil glut (Saudi Arabia in particular) and before Iran re-entered the market, now OPEC is saying it doesn't think it can supply the demand. smh  As for @realDonaldTrump why should our allies bow to your wish after you stabbed them in the back?
41 2018-06-26 23:57:30 Which way is up?? Here are more shots of Joe S.'s Acura engine rebuild.

43 2018-06-26 23:57:16 (Depending on your skin)instead of a moisturizer at night, I made a blend that has my skin flourishing; it’s vitamin E oil with rosemary, lemon, and orange oils. Use a 3:2 ratio for every essential oil you add. It faded my scars and clear my acne
44 2018-06-26 23:57:11 nah gotta wake up early to pack and get an oil change n take care of some last minute stuff before we party

56 2018-06-26 23:55:13 Just about everything contains #Plastic which requires #Oil to produce the plastic!!! Make change in your purchasing to items with less plastic.

62 2018-06-26 23:54:36 I never said I use none, I said I use little (even the garbage bag I use once a month has oil in the plastic) I said I'm not the problem because I'm actively trying to make a difference, can you say the same? Also going from one extreme to another isn't a fix its another problem

65 2018-06-26 23:54:28 A calming of trade waters put oil in the spotlight as prices surged on a combination of supportive factors. The US dollar resumed its rise, and share markets stabilised, and in many cases regained recently lost ground @MicMcCarthy_CMC
66 2018-06-26 23:54:21 He doesn't need to take responsibility for the school system.  The idea that we would blame Scheer for the problems of the insurance industry, or Stephen Harper for problems with economists (never mind oil company mailrooms) is ridiculous.
67 2018-06-26 23:54:21 It is extensively confirmed now. The NOC in Tripoli and GNA have already warned him about trying to ship oil with going through the official NOC.
68 2018-06-26 23:54:20 Well grease my palm with oil.

82 2018-06-26 23:50:44 Try to find any of that oil that spilled into the gulf, you don't think oil leaks naturally?  These accidents will happen but where was you outrage when odumbos epa released millions of gallons of toxic chemicals into the Colorado?

94 2018-06-26 23:48:55 Now I remember why I don’t fry food

1- the hot oil burns, a lot 

2- the house, my clothes, my hair and skin stink 

3- the calories simply aren’t worth it 
95 2018-06-26 23:48:45 Rastaman doesn't fry plantain in deep oil
96 2018-06-26 23:48:44 You're missing the point. You can argue that Obama wasn't harsh enough on the oil industry, but Trump has let them go *nuts.* So I have no idea why you're trying to argue that Dems are the party of Big Oil when Trump's admin is much, much worse
97 2018-06-26 23:48:39 my technique can make it easily mistaken for oil it’s okay

100 2018-06-26 23:47:26 Only way to phase out carbon emissions. Also uses less land then solar fields and wind farms. The only reason nuclear is so expensive is over-regulation of the industry called upon from the uneducated fearmongered general population. Fear, brought by oil and gas giants

104 2018-06-26 23:46:52 CPI folding with the exclusion of oil really shows we did nothing with a decade of monetary expansion up in here.

118 2018-06-26 23:44:13 Most of the Iranian people work in the public sector in the oil and gas sector. These sanctions are too extreme & will hit at the Iranian people more than the rulers. The brutal sanctions against Iraq in 1990s put the people behind decades in terms of health, education & culture.

I GOTTA EAT IT ALL

AND I'M ALREADY FUCKING SWEATING AND PANTIGN
126 2018-06-26 23:43:20 The fact that this article mentions oil exactly zero times is a serious blunder. The emerging collaboration on energy between the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Russia is going to reshape geopolitics. Not even worth mentioning? I guarantee that Trump and Putin will be discussing it.

140 2018-06-26 23:41:43 Heh. Well, and if you think Elon Musk has the solution to oil consumption, I've got a Model 3 Tesla I'd like to sell you ...
141 2018-06-26 23:41:39 Wait until the big oil company's get the last of the crude and bail out ... then what ? ... fishing ?
142 2018-06-26 23:41:31 Yeah I left out he military aspect but that was  a huge for Japan. That will never happen in the US and given where we are today, it really can’t happen but it’s no secret that’s where most American tax dollars go
143 2018-06-26 23:41:25 It’s a love/hate relationship working in the oil field.
144 2018-06-26 23:41:19 The location should be relevant to the issue- protest all you want at oil companies, abortion clinics, police stations, whatever. Refusing to interact with people different from you is legal, should remain that way, but is not good
145 2018-06-26 23:41:13 My car is leaking oil but idk where from and it smells like it’s going to blow up. I can’t wait to not have a car for years.. they are complicated money pits. I hate cars.
146 2018-06-26 23:40:58 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower
147 2018-06-26 23:40:54 Funny how there's enough money in this province for oil rigs but not enough to keep hospitals open.

155 2018-06-26 23:40:23 But but but...I thought the DAMN @GOP was all about the states having the ability to make their own rules? I guess that’s only when the rules don’t run counter to what big oil wants.
156 2018-06-26 23:40:20 i glimpsed how the dudes in the double below me cook: uncut chicken breasts, no oil, not moving them around the surface or flipping each side just, sizzling to death on one side while they both stare at it silently
157 2018-06-26 23:40:15 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
158 2018-06-26 23:40:11 So 9/11, and all the terror attacks here and in Europe since, are because “we took some oil” in 1991?BTW, Al  Qaeda was formed around 1988, 3 years before Desert Storm.

I don’t defend all of our foreign policy decisions, but to blame 9/11 on us is naïveté. It’s far deeper.

The way she lashes out at the @whpresscorps is typical behavior of an abused child. Her father is a snake oil salesman and she is in her position because of him
163 2018-06-26 23:39:56 Just look at those ingredients! I’ll stick to my pure cbd oil!
164 2018-06-26 23:39:42 Im not so much embarrassed that I visit Pornhub in the middle of the day. Im more so embarrassed Im there to watch oil massages w/o penetration.
Its not even a sexual thing, I literally just nodded off.
165 2018-06-26 23:39:40 I need someone to explain the thinking behind putting anchovies in a jar. A jar!!!! Trying to extract some to add to my nicoise salad resulted in me covered in messy oil and lots of tiny broken bits of fish. The other anchovies inside the jar just laughed.

171 2018-06-26 23:39:03 Stella, I was just tweeting about this.  The Sauds are Bush "Family" and trying to safely take over the oil of the Middle East.  Together they were complicit in 9/11, and US has been working with them for generations. Not a conspiracy theory, a conspiracy.

174 2018-06-26 23:38:55 And it’s the “offsping” that may morph into something nefarious so the common sense thing to do is say no thanks to peace loving Muslims entering our country until they convert to a real religion. I’ll say it again: Muslims and our Constitution are like oil and water.
175 2018-06-26 23:38:52 Former Texas Senator Carlos I. Uresti was sentenced by U. S. District Judge David Ezra to 12 years in federal prison for defrauding investors in an oil field services company on 6-25-18 in San Antonio, Texas. Uresti may appeal conviction & sentencing.

It makes no sense for a thriving economy to close themselves off like Trump wants to do

194 2018-06-26 23:36:03 Strawberry actually isn't an essential oil and the seed extract actually doesn't have a scent (or enough of one to actually make scented soap out of anyways!) I could do a fragrance if it has its ingredients listed and is 100% natural (all of my products are all natural), but
195 2018-06-26 23:36:02 The total opposite of that entire olive oil category!
196 2018-06-26 23:35:54 Patience. A lot of patience.                       Also coconut oil.

204 2018-06-26 23:34:50 The ManWhorian Candidate's master, Putin, is taking advantage of America. All of Trump's policies stand to benefit Russia more than us. The Iran thing was just a give away to Russian oil. The tariffs are allowing China to surpass us as the global leader. Big recession coming.

207 2018-06-26 23:34:19 Cookies
1 c butter w 1/4 c coconut oil
1/2 c Stevia (scant)
2 eggs
3/4 t salt
2 t vanilla
1/2 t soda
3 c almond flour
1 c chopped nuts
Beat butter, coconut oil til fluffy. Add ingredients 1 at a time incorporating well. Chill dough. Use scoop bake on parchment at 350° til golden.
208 2018-06-26 23:34:07 I am ready to buy one. If it is 4 wheel drive, can get 200 or more miles on a charge and looks sporty, it will sell well. But you must fight the GOP and big oil that want to crush you at all cost.

210 2018-06-26 23:33:03 If true your hitting the wrong country, try Saudi Arabia ooppps they got oil.
211 2018-06-26 23:33:01 Rank by century? Diamonds out of South Africa (19th), and certainly oil from Middle East and West Africa (20th-present). But I would also add of large-scale heists of humans that lasted a few hundred years...
212 2018-06-26 23:33:00 Any body know about the oil from Israel that the church provide on booking only? Just need confirmation from people on this social media

217 2018-06-26 23:32:21 Nationalism (both cultural and economic) makes no sense to me.  The world gets smaller everyday bc of technology and we are going to be left behind and f we apply these policies for long.

223 2018-06-26 23:32:00 A UBI is a correct way to create a planned economy.  Money is still required, just not work.  We control consumption by putting limits on resource consumption -- land, oil, fish, trees, water. We use capitalism to process the resource into goods and services.

225 2018-06-26 23:31:42 The Med route from Libya to Italy was established after the oil crisis in the 70s. This NGO has worked in the Med since 2016. The crisis was created, sustained and is exacerbated by European governments - not NGOs. At least try to educate your opinions.

I’m talking about the flawed logic of pulling out of free trade agreements, building walls to keep people out, removing the revenue you generate from those people and spending more on keeping them out
243 2018-06-26 23:30:16 if texas made CBD oil a controlled substance I will be very disappointed

270 2018-06-26 23:27:28 I tell this girl to finish the chicken before I left, then put the fries in the oil. I get back to my cousin's house & the chicken is done & sitting in the oven, but the fries are back in the freezer & the oil is off. Like, seriously though?
271 2018-06-26 23:27:17 And the face of the pathetic Republican Party is a 5x draft dodger, a charlatan, a snake oil salesman, a liar, a Putin puppet. The funny thing is, you’re not even a Republican, let alone a conservative. & don’t even try to hide it; we all know you’re madly in love with HRC.

273 2018-06-26 23:27:13 I often think about the same thing (short BMW and oil) but I think it is better to be long TSLA as gains will be more dramatic. If you want an easy short, try shorting coal, it is the 1st to go (and that is 100% certain).

277 2018-06-26 23:26:48 Did I say I was relevant? Also take into consideration all the russian bots and spam accounts that follow him. You, like many of his followers, have no identity. Good job chad.

Because I literally want to dispose of all of the world’s supply of it.

282 2018-06-26 23:25:50 Looks like he's doing some kind of repair! Oil change maybe?  
283 2018-06-26 23:25:48 Nothing's changed either. Oil and water the difference in cultural ideals.

285 2018-06-26 23:25:37 Quebec is too busy filling up their tanks with opec oil from the Saudis and Nigerians at premium prices meanwhile western crude is land locked and has the world’s largest discount on the oil price for WCS we do produce other grades of oil as well in Alberta, Saskatchewan

287 2018-06-26 23:25:32 The only reason US companies don't grind up immigrant children, extract their blood and use it for engine lubricant is because oil is - for now - more cost-effective
288 2018-06-26 23:25:28 We are going to run out of oil in five years
289 2018-06-26 23:25:24 Told the nail lady to massage my shit she literally just rubbing oil on my legs 
290 2018-06-26 23:25:24 Steal their oil and then tell them they can’t come to your nation looking for a better life after you destroyed their countries. Disgrace.
291 2018-06-26 23:25:15 Like yo lemme tell ya how my mom dead made me come all the way back to her crib today for some oil she coulda dropped off on her way home from work, SHE PASS MY CRIB
292 2018-06-26 23:25:00 One drop wonder is an all natural oil that is used in our skin care line but has many more uses. Helps with ...
Eczema, contact dermatitis, Psoriasis, Acne, Rosacea, Burns, bites, scrapes, spider veins, diaper rash, and scars just to name a few.

301 2018-06-26 23:23:24 Do those new energy agreements also include ravaging areas of Africa for the oil and natural gas that Russia desperately needs while Trump turns his back on what Russia is doing in exchange for helping him get elected?

306 2018-06-26 23:22:39 literally just changed the oil in my truck and did this once I got the filter out 
307 2018-06-26 23:22:37 With oil prices creeping upwards, do what you can to limit your oil consumption, unless you want to start paying more for food and other home commodities.Take shorter summer trips, or plan staycations at home, buy more fuel efficient autos.This effects all of our daily budgets.
308 2018-06-26 23:22:36 Trump deals on real estate and not oil besides any oil deal will definitely be for USA and not Trump Org.
309 2018-06-26 23:22:31 I think East ELECTED GOV'T wants to control oil production & marketing to restore order;  corruption, anarchy, & $$ LOSSES UNTIL #LNA be came custodian of wells. #Benghazi will share oil profits w the rest of #Libya -JUST TIRED OF ANARCHY

エキストラバージンオリーブオイルとはオリーブの果実を搾ってろ過しただけのバージンオイルです。

322 2018-06-26 23:20:57 Just sip the oil right off the top.
323 2018-06-26 23:20:56 I bought the most economical imported Italian extra virgin olive oil, bad time to run out
324 2018-06-26 23:20:52 @chrissyteigen made body glitter oil and I NEED 
325 2018-06-26 23:20:52 Why don’t you guys go walk around Evergreen and get some nice olive oil?
326 2018-06-26 23:20:46 It would also practically eliminate Iran as a major oil producer, joining the ranks of Libya and Venezuela. Which also helps Saudi Arabia and the US.
327 2018-06-26 23:20:27 And body oil!
328 2018-06-26 23:20:15 I just dipped my entire hand in fry oil

333 2018-06-26 23:19:51 I’d say neither. He is Indonesian/European in orientation from the perspective of an heir to one of the world’s largest oil fortunes.
334 2018-06-26 23:19:49 The media is the greatest enemy of the American people, anywhere in the world.

336 2018-06-26 23:19:29 I was counting down the seconds before that stock answer came up. Same with Cuba.

338 2018-06-26 23:19:09 The oil company my family used would give a small discount if we paid fast. That's friendlier.
339 2018-06-26 23:19:05 Similar smelling like ethanol to isopropanol as they have similar structures but are all terrible in their own unique way. Moving from shorter to the longer chain fatty acids goes between vomit/rancid butter to sweaty gym socks/bad cheese to barn animals/rancid oil. Wunderbar!
340 2018-06-26 23:19:04 Get China, Russia, Iran and Cuba out of South America.  Get rid of Maduro and the dominoes start falling.  Oil prices falling,  Communism falling, Iran Mullahs falling, saquease China & Russia too.  Winning to the Nth Power.

345 2018-06-26 23:17:16 Hey kid. You have no idea what your talking about. How old are u anyways? You have any idea how many jobs your trying to destroy? We have real men raising families on them oil jobs but u wouldn’t know  cause ur a kid and u probably never worked a real job.
346 2018-06-26 23:17:04 Because they have lots and lots of oil!

350 2018-06-26 23:16:34 MB/Daesh? What's going on in Bani Walid? But yes, I think E. Libyans & LNA fed up with MB plots to get absolute power; may have decided to partition. Honourable so won't hog all oil profits but will sell to prevent the others from stealing profits.
351 2018-06-26 23:16:28 Proceeded into oil that is used for beard growth! That's probably why goats have awesome goatees! (Probably not).
352 2018-06-26 23:16:26 Yes - Vaseline's for stuff like chapped lips or to stop chafing/blisters, surely?! I don't understand why anyone would slap a load of solid mineral oil on an open wound.
353 2018-06-26 23:16:17 Valee discussed the "isotope ratios" in one of his speeches. These have to be engineered. Steve Justice from Lockheed is with TTSA, he's not going to back flying snake oil.
354 2018-06-26 23:16:16 You can’t out slick a can of oil
355 2018-06-26 23:15:57 Try organic hair products, I use organic hair co. They’re really good, they even have some type of stimulation oil to help with growth.
356 2018-06-26 23:15:55 Suppose the lawsuit were successful, and the oil companies had to pay cities $10-50-100 billion in damages.

Where do you think that money comes from? From the sale of oil. Most of which is consumed by drivers. 

In cities. That prioritize driving.

They've now successfully sabotaged our democracy, but we keep building oil-dependent cities. Do you think a lawsuit against them will fix that?

おめでとうございます
422 2018-06-26 23:05:46 Just because a fragrance oil is pthalate free doesn’t mean it’s not full of weird shit
423 2018-06-26 23:05:42 There are so many parking spaces at the Oil Docks yet people still find a way to park next to you

428 2018-06-26 23:04:54 $CAD has strong correlation with #oilprice. 
Last time $WTI was above $70 (besides May 6, 2018) was Nov. 26, 2014. That time USD/CAD was 1.125 & now 1.33

Weakening CAD during oil price rise shows the seriousness of #cdnecon problems!

429 2018-06-26 23:04:31 Actually very simple. In 72 Nixon took the US off gold standard. He promised to use the US military to protect Saudi Arabia in return for the Saudis only accepting US dollars for purchase of their oil. If the US screws with Saudi Arabia they renege and the US dollar will crash
430 2018-06-26 23:04:25 If you see a crystalline solid, it likely does dissolve in water and polars (or falls out of it) Actually, that might explain why they needed specifically hexamine. Is there a good description of the process? What acid is scrubbed, HF? I would use a non-polar solvent+amine oil

433 2018-06-26 23:03:05 The United States vowed Tuesday to impose sanctions on any country that buys Iranian oil after Nov. 4, a tough position likely to alienate many.
434 2018-06-26 23:02:54 keyboard warriors never lose and are always right - we know that - longs are always long when its ripping shorts are always short when collapses - of course they are - God doesnt even want to trade oil thats why he sent the dinosaurs over
435 2018-06-26 23:02:53 As if cities act in a vacuum ... 
As for responsibility: Do you honestly believe that the oil companies possess Zero responsibility for climate change?
436 2018-06-26 23:02:42 いっしょ、いっしょ、この驚きと気づいた時の、なーんや感分かってくれる人いて嬉しい
437 2018-06-26 23:02:42 Redding Subaru stayyyys taking days for a oil change. Ridiculous.
438 2018-06-26 23:02:29 You probably can’t even change your own oil & wanna talk about somebody getting an education. Stop saying excuses my guy
439 2018-06-26 23:02:26 I think we all want clean air.  There are ways to capture the pollutants.  Just like a little company in Texas captures the waste gases in oil production and creates synthetic fuel, electricity and water.  This would be great for poor countries.
440 2018-06-26 23:02:21 If youve never had chicken fried with bacon oil in pancake batter, you've never lived

449 2018-06-26 23:00:07 So the Alernative KM pulled out and  What ?  Myself I only think we need two more pipelines One to the Sea and one East than settle in No More than that Canadian Oil for Canada first as far as that goes "Nationalized" as it were

452 2018-06-26 23:00:01 Totally.  "Oil on panel" plus year is usually enough for me.
453 2018-06-26 22:59:57 My personal view is its inevitable anyway. Just a matter of when and not if. Sound fiscal policy will keep it at bay for a while but not forever. China will be king someday. 1.5 billion ppl can't be stopped.
454 2018-06-26 22:59:54 So I guess the soap I bought has real peppermint oil in it and I did not know that but honestly my hole has never been tighter
455 2018-06-26 22:59:47 Generally to ride in the “worn in” tire tracks on the inside part of the lane. Honestly you’re only supposed to ride there or in the center (especially if you’re riding alone), but center can be dangerous because of oil leaks, etc. :)
456 2018-06-26 22:59:47 I thought Senators and up had Secret Service protection details.
457 2018-06-26 22:59:45 the mac & cheese? Yes! I've made it multiple times now. It's not as rich as cashew/oil based recipes, but I think it's really good for a more veggie-based option!
458 2018-06-26 22:59:34 Electric car is the solution to get over militancy in India. The oil money siphon will vanish along with militancy. It is great that India has the talent and intention to take this leap. Providence is also favoring as Pakistan is going bankrupt.

462 2018-06-26 22:59:09 The great irony is mostly caused by my country who wantVenezuela oil. You think thats worse CIA has got? I want Trump to see how wrong he is

469 2018-06-26 22:58:00 No more oil flowing through BC shores, hey?
470 2018-06-26 22:57:44 No, houdaille was a tax law.  Oil import restrictions in the 1960s  and a couple of other products
471 2018-06-26 22:57:37 The pizza I just ate had olive oil on it and holy shit that made it so much more amazing
472 2018-06-26 22:57:32 but not banned from pouring oil on his junk
473 2018-06-26 22:57:12 Umm...when they're cooking I watch for the edges to brown and I listen to the popping of the oil. (When you 1st put em in, oil goin crazy; as they begin to cook the crackle and pop lessens.) That plus brown edges and you flip em over, repeat.
474 2018-06-26 22:57:10 Economics does not involve emotion. Sound policy that insures the strength and viability of the nation should exclude it. We are all equally broke in a failed economy won't be anything to smile about. There will be here, irrevocably.

476 2018-06-26 22:56:58 I keep my skillet on med heat. I use olive oil others use canola. I don't have a preference. 

I slice mine diagonally, but it's whatever. Just fry them bitches up and ima eat em.
477 2018-06-26 22:56:51 No joke! I saw it on some news program. I cut a mountain of hair every week. I wish someone would come collect it for oil spills!

481 2018-06-26 22:55:57 What about the Alberta business that were forced to close when the oil prices tanked, where is our bailout????? @pnpcbc
482 2018-06-26 22:55:45 they believed the bullshit coming out of El Trumpo's mouth & have been totally suckered. Hes the modern Flim Flam man selling snake oil to cure all ills whilst lining his families pockets. when they follow the money it will all be revealed in due course.
483 2018-06-26 22:55:26 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
484 2018-06-26 22:55:22 Funny thing is, I jacked up my car today to fix a hole in oil pan.  But I wear panties, not boxers like young m.a.

487 2018-06-26 22:55:08 1. Pollution from coal and oil companies increase health care costs by trillions of dollars over time. Congress and State Legislatures should fine the companies to recoup costs for Medicare, Medicaid - asthma, heart and lung, cancers, etc. IMF Externalities Prices Do Not Capture

489 2018-06-26 22:54:30 They say play fire with fire, but i choose to just water them up because if you threw more oil, you’re creating more damage than it already has.
490 2018-06-26 22:54:11 CPP is exceptionally good at what they do. Maybe JKenney is just worried that the future is something other than oil...
491 2018-06-26 22:54:09 They spelled snake oil wrong, too.
492 2018-06-26 22:54:08 Stay well hydrated till 5am then stop otherwise youll need to pee during sleep time. I cant do caffeine after midnight. Eat well. Exercise. Blackout curtains. Ear plugs. Hot pack for bed. Lavender oil. Magnesium tablets. Quality sleep still not a guarantee.
493 2018-06-26 22:53:55 I haven’t made a dime on oil, ...so do I win?

495 2018-06-26 22:53:45 Hey VA would it make sense to short BMW, and/or all the legacy autos in a bundle? Do you ever short and would you consider it? Could be a short on the scale of the movie The Big Short. Throw in oil companies; even bigger!

#OOTT
498 2018-06-26 22:53:25 Dear @realDonaldTrump  and #MAGA - did you know Canada sells oil to the US at a discount because of NAFTA? Perhaps a change in cost will shock the market back to reality if NAFTA fails
499 2018-06-26 22:53:07 They must have a surplus of coconut oil they don't know how else to get rid of!

512 2018-06-26 22:51:10 When they stop getting degrees funded by oil under state lands
513 2018-06-26 22:51:01 I tried the tea tree oil shampoo (more cleansing) but wish i got the argan oil (more moisturizing) shampoo instead. And i got the vitamin E conditioner it’s great, apply it from roots to ends not just ends, think the vit E soothed my scalp after couple washes
514 2018-06-26 22:50:30 Why do you think the foolish virgins wouldn’t bring enough oil to last until He comes?
515 2018-06-26 22:50:19 Stop drinking that snake oil you sell
516 2018-06-26 22:50:19 Just catching up with @JohnSwinney cracking up when you 'mentioned' the oil fund. Oh, how we still laugh.
517 2018-06-26 22:49:59 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.

519 2018-06-26 22:49:54 Sure hope this is the @CatheMcKennna parody account. Start screwing with CPP. Goodluck all retired Canucks. This will end well. Something akin to the oil pipelines.

521 2018-06-26 22:49:44 In 1854 GB deported the King of the Kingdom of Bonny and signed a treaty that year. Power struggle prevention, I believe, and to protect palm oil trade.
522 2018-06-26 22:49:40 "I discovered oil."

529 2018-06-26 22:49:02 Yes + Americans need to wake up now! trump also demanding that every country in the world must pull back from using Iranian oil or face sanctions from the US.
530 2018-06-26 22:48:42 Awful how we use so much oil (and don’t have to look at it in the face everyday). Think you miss the point
531 2018-06-26 22:48:31 Palm oil trade?

541 2018-06-26 22:47:13 Yamaha YXZ1000R racer CJ Greaves won back-to-back Pro Stock SxS wins at the wet and muddy Lucas Oil Midwest Short Course League debut. 
On Saturday, CJ started 22nd off the line and ran out of tear-offs by lap 2 and still pulled out the win! #nevergiveup — feeling determined
542 2018-06-26 22:47:06 You're prob one that supports a $15 min wage. 
I paid that in late 90's to resident aliens and American citizens when competition paid illegals $8. Chicanos were the worst at taking advantage of illegal labor. So much for looking out for their own.
543 2018-06-26 22:46:49 SF&Oakland nut jobs try to sue,  holding big oil co. for causing global warming.  Well i may be all wet, but wouldn't the people purchasing the gas and other fuels and burning them in cars and trucks etc. Be the one's held liable. They weren't forced to buy and burn it. Idiots.
544 2018-06-26 22:46:36 A wall would settle this argument quickly 
545 2018-06-26 22:46:30 Manuka Honey + Coffee + Cocunut Oil.    Thank me later
546 2018-06-26 22:46:14 We just asked our travel agent why prices aren't coming down for Vancouver-NZ/Australia flights. It's not just oil prices. She cited lack of competition. So many Canadians are asking to not connect through LA & San Francisco that it keeps demand high.
547 2018-06-26 22:46:13 する！

551 2018-06-26 22:45:57 After 73 we started oil and gas production that’s what boosted our economy not the EU we didn’t sign up for Brussels dictating our laws
552 2018-06-26 22:45:40 i got the bibs and the baby oil for his legs
553 2018-06-26 22:45:24 I asked once. "Oil spills," came the reply. "They put it in mesh bags and use it for oil spills. Soaks up oil like nothing else."

To this day I do not know whether he was joking.
554 2018-06-26 22:44:59 It’s probably not 100% pure tea tree oil and if it is the real deal you have to Dilute it first using a toner
555 2018-06-26 22:44:47 Exactly! She muted or blocked me soon as I posted facts. 

This shows they just want (or need) to believe the snake oil Trump is selling.
556 2018-06-26 22:44:36 never heard about the Jojoba oil lol  where do you buy  it?
557 2018-06-26 22:44:31 #Iran is going to continúe with the agreement reached in the 2016 by the #OPEC's members and other countries. The reduce of the oil production to hold the price high. None of the countries would dare to use the agreement as a coercion tool.

565 2018-06-26 22:43:30 I swear Shanay and I, we’re like oil and waterrrr
566 2018-06-26 22:43:23 Who r those dan ****su
567 2018-06-26 22:43:17 Time to start taxing the $30 Billion in remittances Mexicans residing in US send back to Mexico each year.Long overdue,especially since many of these folks are receiving a variety of government benefits here in US. Largest single source of income 2Mexico, greater than oil,tourism
568 2018-06-26 22:43:12 I did do my own research of glucosamine & Fish Oil to see what the benefits are. Glucosamine is good for joint & flexibility & Fish Oil helps reduce blood pressure, plaque in the arteries from hardening & w/anxiety & depression among other things. Who knew

571 2018-06-26 22:43:05 "Shared interest" = give us your oil, not your people
572 2018-06-26 22:42:23 1/3 cup brown sugar
1/3 cup flour
1/3 cup water/plant based milk
1/3 cup oil except olive
1/3 cup cocoa powder
Splash of vanilla
Splash of maple syrup

Mix that shit in a mug together and microwave for aboot 2 minutes. You're welcome. 5 minute cake.
573 2018-06-26 22:42:21 We had oil and coal and we made stuff. Even then we were called the 'sick man of europe'. Then Thatcher got in, tied us to the EU, sold everything off and handed tax breaks to the few. It's gonna be rough Piers.
574 2018-06-26 22:42:16 I blame our players the most,were the Architect of our misfortune, we couldn't defend 4 mins,and refuse to utilize our chances
575 2018-06-26 22:42:06 So. Many conflicting messages in this. Eg. Pinochet was propped up by the US & UK. Gaddafi? Look at #Libya apartheid was fiercely defended by Thatcher. Brought down by mass public movement. And the Shah of #Iran wanted a fair price for his oil. Then look what "WE" did.
576 2018-06-26 22:42:06 Also the reason I'll put $'s down at 100:1 will refuse 1 on 1 debate at election time as Bill is game ready while is still on the masseurs table, being liberally plied with Truffle oil. #auspol
577 2018-06-26 22:42:02 Well, the first one tried to give Albertans something they are asking for today (the East would be buying our oil instead of Saudi Arabia’s), but that would have meant sacrificing short term prosperity. The second one has been hated since his first day in office. Sooo...

597 2018-06-26 22:38:57 Today's macroeconomics (Trump edition) lesson: oil spiked on statements from the State Department about sanctioning anyone importing Iranian oil. This is mostly an artificial crisis created by Trump's fat mouth.
598 2018-06-26 22:38:52 What about the small businesses that were forced to close their doors when the price of oil tanked, where is our bailout????????
599 2018-06-26 22:38:26 It's not just him, though. It's the entire mobbed-up, Putin-indebted, Christo fascist GOP, lobbyists, special interest groups, billionaires and oil tycoons (#CNP) burning it all to the ground.
600 2018-06-26 22:38:23 When desperate I will use olive oil
601 2018-06-26 22:38:08 Hah! BS. The Republican plan for military retirees is to kill them before they reach retirement age—cutting food stamps, cutting VA funding, and sending them off to die in our never ending wars for oil and empire.
602 2018-06-26 22:37:54 Do you mind about the child slaves working for your chocolate, gold, lithium, coltan, Mercury, phone parts, clothes. Not to mention the palm oil that is in everything we buy. Oh and let's not forget the oil that we put in our cars every day. Plenty of human misery!! Alas
603 2018-06-26 22:37:40 ITJM or will voters disbelieve that the @liberal_party supports  climate change after spending $11 billion on a leaky pipeline, agreeing to build a new pipeline to rape the oil sands and promoting a useless carbon tax?
604 2018-06-26 22:37:38 If I had a son do that to a female officer he’d be grounded for a year. No car, no phone, no life. Don’t put your hands on a lady. Don’t harass public officials, especially a lady. Period. Spoiled millennial punks.

611 2018-06-26 22:36:53 Simple: money and oil. With Pakistan, it’s that they have nukes that we didn’t want to fall into the hands of AQ. That’s been a tightwire act. Fun fact: we let Pakistan get nukes b/c they helped us vs. the USSR in Afghanistan in the 80s. It’s our own mess.
612 2018-06-26 22:36:53 not tonight bro, not tonight. Buh if na for not renewing those oil blocks licences alone I can get my pvc for that.

615 2018-06-26 22:36:42 Holy crap. I finally cooked something the kids BOTH asked for seconds of. Avocado oil and butter together, pork chops sprinkled with garlic powder and salt, sautee until done. They LOVED it.

636 2018-06-26 22:34:42 If keeping out terrorists is the REAL REASON  behind this ban, then I have a real problem with Saudi Arabia not being on that list. So many of the perpetrators have come from or thru that country. Only reason they aren’t on it is because of the oil. 
637 2018-06-26 22:34:40 The US informed all countries that they must reduce Iranian oil imports to zero by Nov 4th. US will sanction countries if they're still importing from Iran. The Trump Administration is going to put severe sanctions on Iran in August. President Trump is not messing around

656 2018-06-26 22:33:02 Oil for peace. At least that reduces the resource curse. Not that the people of #SSudan are better off with or without it. But at least they will go back to their farms, and rebuild on their own accord as they have always done, given the peace!

676 2018-06-26 22:30:35 Sorry olive oil. Yeah mix it
677 2018-06-26 22:30:31 No one wanted to buy it because there was uncertainty that it wouldn't ever be built but now the government stepped up, it has the green light.  At the end of the day it's an oil pipeline. Someone will buy it.

689 2018-06-26 22:28:40 And this assessment doesn’t take into account how much the RUK economy will suffer if Scotland decides enough is enough and goes for independence. The pound crashes to below a dollar as oil, whisky and other exports go with Scotland. No fish to bargain with.

700 2018-06-26 22:27:33 I live in Texas everytime I go to S Padre island to go fishing you have to drive through one of these checks, it’s been that way all my life. You pull up they ask what’s going on you tell them and then roll on down the highway, outside El Paso on I10 there’s one too.
701 2018-06-26 22:27:26 Tissue paper... Is that with or without olive oil? Sit down, take some deep breaths, close your eyes and go back to last place you were at when you felt joy. Stay there until the dark clouds roll away.
702 2018-06-26 22:27:18 They don’t have a Robust label- perhaps it’s the signature olive oil. But I’m grateful that you told me about this family farm. This is exactly the sort of thing I love to buy!

707 2018-06-26 22:27:04 It WOULD be my luck that an oil worker buying jewelry ahead of me in line is paying with cash.
708 2018-06-26 22:26:55 I don 't think so. LNA guarded & sent oil to central facility but kept being harassed by Jadran who has strong connections to Misrata. Libya's 1 elected gov't is in Tobruk & he has handed the oil to them. Fajr in power due to a coup in 2014-not v. democratic

710 2018-06-26 22:26:45 my mom just walked into my room with our coconut oil and our cocoa butter and said “if you rub both of these on your hands.......you have a mounds bar.” ........um thanks for letting me know????
711 2018-06-26 22:26:39 Couple of cool demos then ask them to discuss the physics... e.g. Predict pattern produced if laser light passes through two slits (could ask what would happen if electrons rather than light was used). Could measure diameter of an oil drop on water to find height of oil molecule?
712 2018-06-26 22:26:18 Try that shit in Oklahoma and you are liable to get a gun in your face.
713 2018-06-26 22:26:18 Ohh okay thank you for the tips. Oh btw where did you get the castor oil? Beli online ke?
714 2018-06-26 22:26:09 OMG love them! 

The skin around your nails looks really sore, hun. I found Boots' own hand cream for sensitive skin really good. Also just plain coconut oil. qObvs once there's no open cuts  Sorry for butting in they just looked sore x

716 2018-06-26 22:26:04 Social programs are largely failures as personal responsibility and metrics to gauge success or failure largely absent. Success for welfare for example is measured by how many can you sign up. The more you sign up, the more successful it is.
717 2018-06-26 22:26:04 $USO Beginning of a major bull run in oil. We all have been wondering when the inflection point would hit well here we are..

719 2018-06-26 22:25:59 OPEC announced plans to increase oil output by 1 MILLION barrels a day! Oil Crude up today: 70.30! More Winning! lol Oil prices rise after Trump says to stop importing oil from Iran! WTG Mr. President!!!
720 2018-06-26 22:25:45 Ok @pulpmx you ought to know that because of you, I have EKS Brand goggles, Michelin StarCross 5’s, Fly Gear, a Guts seat cover, Maxima oil and chemicals, and I just ordered an AC Systems nose thing. Keep up the good work

722 2018-06-26 22:25:19 One day the world will truly be free through love of helping one another rather charging one another thus the heart or soul will be free to travel with out death. First transportation is key to find a way without using oil and vehicles should be a trade for trade not by mileage.
723 2018-06-26 22:25:00 I've picked up a mauser after finding it in a house abandoned since 1916-ish. I sprayed a 200ml can of gun oil into it, loaded period ammo found next to it and fired of over 20 rounds without a failiure.

Good luck doing that to a Sig after a hundred years.
724 2018-06-26 22:24:54 They bought me a brand new car. When they needed to go somewhere, it was their car. When it needed gas, oil changes, tires, brakes, lights, car washes and major expenses? It became my car... 
725 2018-06-26 22:24:53 Also, did you miss my links that explained that all petrochemical plants / refineries and so on have some kind of amine scrubber. Since there have oil and gas industries in Syria, I expect that any large scale CW lab uses the same chems for the same role. Was that not obvious?
726 2018-06-26 22:24:49 Good food oil esisted
727 2018-06-26 22:24:44 USE all that OIL MONEY & NO TAXES & fix the CRIME!!! GOP/TEXAS weak on CRIME
728 2018-06-26 22:24:43 Wow sis. You can definitely use Garnier cleansing water but I r comment you use products made for African skin. Shea moisture is the best. Use their coconut oil, wet wipes, African Black soup. Any of their products are good actually
729 2018-06-26 22:24:42 Thank you!  I have a real oil beetle somewhere, will have to dig it out...
730 2018-06-26 22:24:41 Venezuela's a petro state. PDVSA is the state owned oil company that makes up most of the economic gains, or lack there of.
731 2018-06-26 22:24:29 am I the only one who hates that vine when the girl pours the canola oil and makes the kids get their juice
732 2018-06-26 22:24:00 The only place it's weaker is Canada, due mainly because of foreign interests trying to keep our oil landlocked. The oil sector in the USA, Russia etc is going gangbusters.
733 2018-06-26 22:23:54 Ppl really be driving cars and never check they oil or get they tires rotated and balanced...then wonder why they car running shitty
734 2018-06-26 22:23:41 You guys like throwing oil spills? Let's throw a fucking Tsunami at you and see how you like it.

741 2018-06-26 22:22:33 Looks like the wrath is on you as API reported 9 million barrel draw;  funny to see technicals think they drive the market when it is indeed the fundamentals which do.  Never bet against Saudi Arabia and you will win everytime. #OOTT
742 2018-06-26 22:22:29 after taking my painting class and using oil for a long time, i’m using acrylic right now and i’m like damn this dries really fast

744 2018-06-26 22:21:29 Great. So when do we get our oil pipeline? Nothing’s free.
745 2018-06-26 22:21:18 @NPR why are you accepting ad money from the natural gas & oil lobby? More importantly natural gas & oil lobby why are you advertising on NPR?!?!!! KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE, natural gas and oil lobby. Know. Your. Audience.
746 2018-06-26 22:21:16 Have you ever seen how much damage is created from making thoose solar pannels ? Most of there parts are made from oil . no oil = no plastic

754 2018-06-26 22:20:26 I need to stop drinking and planning invasions on small countries that don't exist. (though they do have oil) I've seen the small refineries  made out of bricks.

756 2018-06-26 22:20:17 All I did was point out fact. Libertarians admit that their brand of econ doesnt work with a welfare state but still advance it as an alternative knowing the conditions for success will never exist. Welfare is not going away, ever.

Olive oil ? Lol
759 2018-06-26 22:20:06 Good morning
How are you I'm good
Oil went up again yep to to 70.48
It's over my 70 danger range
So just fill up regardless
760 2018-06-26 22:20:05 For my wash n go’s I use the SM Jamaican castor oil leave in conditioner, then the SM curl enhancing smoothie + eco styler (mix them in your hand together, do it in sections), then I like to rake moose through it after wards. That’s how my hair got like it was in that pic!
761 2018-06-26 22:19:54 Hello! Do you like the way nature looks? Did you know that on September 30th The Land and Water Conservation Fund, our most important program for protecting our nation’s trails, is set to expire? Don’t let them put oil rigs in parks. Holla at law people to #SaveLWCF
762 2018-06-26 22:19:46 trump hotels and oil rich....
763 2018-06-26 22:19:41 If you think the lawsuits are about “slashing oil use”, you’re clearly missing the point ... or, more likely, playing troll
764 2018-06-26 22:19:39 What sort of oil is used and at what temperature?
765 2018-06-26 22:19:34 Oil markets in store for a big spike if this plays out.  Trump simply has no clue about the oil market, lack of capex and spare capacity.  This is going to get real soon enough.

767 2018-06-26 22:19:24 Our biggest is a Kubota 9960 and it just about did the job ..... slowly lol. Seen faster oil tankers
768 2018-06-26 22:19:22 You mean aside from the contracts from shippers legally bound to pay even if they don’t ship oil that have already signed binding agreements to buy at least 50% of the capacity for the first *15 years* of operation?

The space is already sold. 

The activists don’t mention that
769 2018-06-26 22:19:19 Saudi has a capacity to increase it’s oil exports by 2 million barrels/day.
770 2018-06-26 22:19:19 They don't even buther extracting the oil from the snakes anymore
771 2018-06-26 22:19:15 Medrano’s oil change is having a customer appreciation day Saturday June 30th at the Isaiah 58 parking lot, there will be hotdogs and hamburgers from 8 am-12 pm. They’re also taking donations for the Sizenbach and Montgomery family so be sure to go out there (:

775 2018-06-26 22:18:49 Went vegetarian for a few months with Mrs bull when I tried out FIRE for a bit. We were only spending around $20-30 a week on food shopping at our local market only. We bought big bags of flour/rice and commercial olive oil cans and everything else was local. This is in NZD too.
776 2018-06-26 22:18:46 When it comes to oil we are the same religion
777 2018-06-26 22:18:35 Judge dismisses climate change case vs major oil companies......winning
778 2018-06-26 22:18:34 You think your little pickup truck batteries will actually supply enough amps to work in an industrial setting like construction or the oil patch? With no genset? LOL!!!
Have you ever worked in that type of industry??
779 2018-06-26 22:18:33 Years ago HD developed a bike that didn't leak oil like an incontinent pet and ran quiet and smooth as silk.

But as an HD bike, it didn't sell worth a crap. So HD returned to making leaky, shaky,  loud bikes and everyone was happy.

There's a reason HD bikers look like this guy.
780 2018-06-26 22:18:32 Funny... I watched oil prices shoot up the last couple of days... analysts say it’s because “US tells Allies to halt Iranian Oil Imports by November.”
If I am our “Allies”, I would tell us to go pound sand. Thanks, Trump.

If I had a bloody clever American lawyer I could probs sue her estate for what she did to my generation.
I was in Aberdeen when the oil, the yanks & the heroin hit the town. 
It has devastated Scotland, especially North East. Makes me cry.

789 2018-06-26 22:17:26 Don’t forget, you’ve gotta throw the world “oil” in there somewhere and then vaguely allude to the idea that 9/11 was an inside job (but nothing specific enough that you can’t deny the claim later)

792 2018-06-26 22:17:14 It's wild the fact Vaseline comes from crude oil and I used to rub that on my face
793 2018-06-26 22:17:14 tell me this though. How is it immigrants from Saudi Arabia. are not included in the ban? You realize the terrorist from 911 came from there and terrorist are protected by the gov. there. maybe, it's the Oil? So they are okay ? LOL
794 2018-06-26 22:17:13 I’ve tried fish oil in the past without noticing much. I did the recommended dosage, so maybe that’s why.
795 2018-06-26 22:16:52 Oil changes everything.

798 2018-06-26 22:16:32 When Scotland is independent let's see if Londoners & Westminster miss the Oil & Gas revenues, I'm guessing they will. I have been sat in a Pub in London when some dickhead has in formed me that we in the North are subsidised, that conversation didn't end well for them.
799 2018-06-26 22:16:31 Aku udah no banget sama milk klenser. Muka ku makin berminyak, no.

800 2018-06-26 22:16:22 So on a side with the burner off. And olive oil.  Where do I find vegetable seasoning. Any recommendations?? And as for time how long.
801 2018-06-26 22:16:18 We eat them weekly..kale too. I often throw them in the oven together. I like slicing sideways into thin pieces and stirfrying... or oil em up...throw garlic salt in em and 20 at 375.. and sprinkle with parmesan. I do same with kale.
802 2018-06-26 22:16:17 Oh that sucks! I thought mine was bad about not covering anything. Oh wait, do you have to do the special compounded one since you had a reaction to the sesame oil? Because my insurance wouldn’t touch that one.

Ternyata pas pake mekap, mekapnya ga bersih tohh. Jadi yg harus dipake apa? Oil sama milk cleanser?
809 2018-06-26 22:15:05 Yes absolutely we love immigrants who come legally. Engineers are much needed. Apply to an energy company or oil company. There are always jobs there.
810 2018-06-26 22:15:04 On June 20, 2014, a barrel of West Texas Intermediate sold for more than $107/barrel (US) and by March 2015 the price was $42/barrel (US). Should the NDP take credit for the $65 drop in oil price that happened 2 months before they were elected?
811 2018-06-26 22:15:01 Tubes and pipes having circular cross-sections and an external diameter of > 406,4 mm, of flat-rolled products of iron or steel, welded (excl. welded products or products of a kind used for oil or gas pipelines or of a kind used i 2,1 €/kg  change 6,24%
812 2018-06-26 22:14:59 Exactly and that's very sad because we're in bed with them and are looking the other way because of our oil interest. 
813 2018-06-26 22:14:57 As dedicated you are to your overlord, still no one would care. Can you influence policy? Do you speak for the administration? No. So no one cares about you.
814 2018-06-26 22:14:57 I relapsed bacc on that oil again!
815 2018-06-26 22:14:55 Fun ways to kill time #2056: join an amway meeting you happen upon accidentally. When they call on you, tell a good story about a really hard sell you made and how nervous you were about not making the sale. 

Never reveal you were actually over leveraged on oil futures.
816 2018-06-26 22:14:49 For the record, To my knowledge I have never sniffed straight peppermint oil. 
817 2018-06-26 22:14:40 Doesn’t the US get most of its oil from Canada?
818 2018-06-26 22:14:33 No new books for me today because I was an adult and got an oil change instead. I was really hoping to pick up Trail of Lightning today too. Boo hiss.
819 2018-06-26 22:14:32 An oversupply at low end will drive ppl to seek better jobs increasing supply of labor and ultimately decreasing wages in those higher paying jobs when supply exceeds demand. It's a ripple effect throughout an economy.
820 2018-06-26 22:14:28 I’ve never tried the baby oil option myself but that’s what the company told me I guess because you aren’t meant to tell parents to rub alcohol on kids 
821 2018-06-26 22:14:27 Coconut oil works too!!! And is cheaper  and it’s safe if he licks it off  and loads cheaper!!!

We have been going thru a global commodity drop in prices potash, uranium, oil, natural gas which is a lot of our largest exports and we have managed to keep services and not load on a lot of debt to keep the lights on and once prices come back
829 2018-06-26 22:13:13 I have seen my daughter go through seizures only twice thankfully but without her twice daily medication it would be far more often. I don’t know if moving is an option but I would seriously consider Canada if you can, cbd oil is miraculous for kids with seizures

846 2018-06-26 22:10:25 The only type of people I know who put hot coffee in a blender are the people who use coconut oil instead of coconut milk (since coconut oil solidifies). But I don't think that's an option at that store. Maybe it's related thou.

850 2018-06-26 22:10:03 Divestment away from the oil sands since 2013, + the complete lack of private buyers wanting #TMX, make it far more likely I am right than the desperate folks at CAPP who are always proven wrong on their projection estimates. The case for expansion is investor-baiting mythology.
851 2018-06-26 22:09:53 This snake oil salesman is no different than Jim Baker, Tony Robbins and all those fake tv televangelists barking for money. If Ivanka likes him I know he's a fraud. These people empower themselves period.
852 2018-06-26 22:09:48 this oil pen is hitting woww
853 2018-06-26 22:09:44 Maybe this has more to do with Russia being the number one oil producer in the world than with any actual concerns about Iran.
854 2018-06-26 22:09:32 It used to be steak until I learned how to grill SALMON w.o burning/drying it out.  Just make sure to add enough oil on the grill so they don't stick.  Shrimp, beef or chicken kabobs w/oodles of veggies are good too.
855 2018-06-26 22:09:24 Short term, sure. There was a turn around. But the main cause of inflationary turmoil was oil supply and Vietnam war. As Reagan lowered tax rates, increased defense spending, deregulated, and pushed against unions, there was less revenue on the gov side.....
856 2018-06-26 22:09:13 The displayed chivalry is so attractive
857 2018-06-26 22:09:10 man i got 20% oil life left
858 2018-06-26 22:09:08 And these days they be have cannabis oil for it.. 
859 2018-06-26 22:08:55 if DONALD decides that, then the price of oil will go over 100 dollars a barrel which it will affect all the world I am sure he would not take that option.
860 2018-06-26 22:08:41 Pretty dumb to call for a street fight against the people with most of the food, oil, and guns.
861 2018-06-26 22:08:39 This one is deep
862 2018-06-26 22:08:23 Also, India runs a current account deficit even at historical oil lows. No country has become middle class by just consumption & savings. 

It's investment and export side is next to abysmal. It is 25 years and people are still searching for the unicorn.
863 2018-06-26 22:08:19 So today at work I witnessed an oil tank driver basically hijack a mister softie truck and start giving customers ice cream as the ice cream truck driver just stood there... love my job and where they send me
864 2018-06-26 22:08:15 Which of these taste good and do bot contain soy nor canola oil?
865 2018-06-26 22:08:15 No problem natural Oasis makes a good hair oil too
866 2018-06-26 22:08:06 Lmfaoo facts sis make sure you get some oil to put on your scalp too
867 2018-06-26 22:08:01 Nigga get the juul then put the oil in the juul
868 2018-06-26 22:08:01 I had an oil change appointment at Lexus at 5PM, I haven’t had dinner and my car is still not ready. I should have known I’d be here forever. Everytime I’m at Lexus they legit take 2-3 hours. I just want to get home after a long day.
869 2018-06-26 22:07:37 AN HOUR BEFORE CLOSE!!! “Can I get 2 oil changes please.” 
870 2018-06-26 22:07:36 Jesus Christ Valarie Jarrett of all people had near Seal Team Six level security and. she was a nobody. WTF Capital Hill police, where are you???
871 2018-06-26 22:07:30 Don't doubt there was some involvement and assistance but they soon lost control and Islamists were only too happy to take advantage. With the vast oil fields and insurgency it was always going to happen anyway.
872 2018-06-26 22:07:20 Oil is not helping the other producing nations in the list. And they produce more
873 2018-06-26 22:07:11 I need a oil change!
874 2018-06-26 22:06:54 Next time I order glasses I'm not getting "Premium oil and fingerprint resistant (Oleophobic)" coating on them - it may have taken longer when they were first ordered for them to get oily, but now that they do they are impossible to keep clean.
875 2018-06-26 22:06:53 We check your Engine, Transmission, Brakes, Mufflers, Oil Changes, Tune-ups, AC Service, Auto Body, AND MORE!
876 2018-06-26 22:06:49 Realistically all our pension money is on the roulette table, black or red, oil or green energy. Only time will tell. But I will bet on this. They have it covered both ways.
877 2018-06-26 22:06:16 I'm still looking for the person who told us black people that a cooking oil is a fish oil yazi....
878 2018-06-26 22:05:03  he has four followers and is an obvious foreign propaganda account. If you people were born in the 1800’s you’d buy up all the snake oil. Jesus Christ.
879 2018-06-26 22:04:46 Sell your snake oil somewhere else sir :)
880 2018-06-26 22:04:39 あわー！！！テーブルマジですか…！！？！めちゃくちゃに可愛いですねいや可愛い…フィリくんそういうところありますね…
気づかいって解釈すごく分かるし素敵です…好きすぎます良い情報をありがとうございますーーー！
881 2018-06-26 22:04:31 Ik for a fact that even his bodyguards are corrupt. I’ve been lucky enough to be raised to in a family that was doing okay. I’ve had relatives who opened oil refinery and took billions in loans and those ppl started showing up for their share of the $ until they dried the founds.
882 2018-06-26 22:04:23 The result i is more pollution and continued oil dependence. Pollution negatively impacts the environment and human health (smog alerts anyone?). Green energy continues to become more affordable despite DT.  Removal of EPA scientists does not alter the reality of climate change
883 2018-06-26 22:04:18 BIZARRE! Why on earth would @potus think he has ANY moral authority 2dictate to allies what they should or shouldn't do re: Iran oil aftr having withdrawn US from Paris Climate agrmnt, Iran Nuke deal, UN Human Rights Councl, also imposed tariffs on close allies & China? Buffoon!!
884 2018-06-26 22:04:08 I will march headlong into the salty, oil coated void with a smile on my face
885 2018-06-26 22:04:07 Got canes and the oil on the chicken was still sizzling and I need new pants
886 2018-06-26 22:03:55 Tryna slick a can of oil who ya think ya foolin
887 2018-06-26 22:03:46 The knowledge that every one of these guys would be extinct within 72 hours of no drive throughs gives me hope.
888 2018-06-26 22:03:32 its the mystery behind the pronunciation.  anything even remotely close and people will just assume youre talking about that thing.

like if i called him xx extravirginolive oil
889 2018-06-26 22:03:17 Jesus! We Dems are nearly as gullible as Trumpsters. The only difference is just which snake oil hucksters we bought from. How in fuck could progressive turnout be affected by media misinformation, when the truth was so readily at hand?
890 2018-06-26 22:03:11 They’re going to have to start protecting cabinet like they do  potus. I’m appalled they were able to get to her. But good for her for not cowering. She gave it right back to them. But this should NEVER be allowed to happen again.

896 2018-06-26 22:02:13 Fingers in the oil pie
897 2018-06-26 22:02:08 Agreed. There has been zero cost so far, only reputational one which BJ shrugs off. Joint patrols, embedded USCG, provision of maritime domain awareness, oil drilling by US/Indian assets, linkage to Taiwan/trades, more real time publicity.. Anything that neuters PRC’s DIY 9DL!
898 2018-06-26 22:01:59 Thank you everyone that has helped  us make this happen. I do not need to get high! I only need the oil to stop my seizures!!
899 2018-06-26 22:01:49 My roommate takes CBD oil and its helps her with her anxiety, but it gives her headaches sometimes.
900 2018-06-26 22:01:41 Nver diss WD-40, the lubricant oil of the gods.
901 2018-06-26 22:01:29 amin
902 2018-06-26 22:01:13 It just aint meant for me to get a oil changed
903 2018-06-26 22:01:12 And if you're cooking on a budget, try making something like pangrattato - literally, breadcrumbs.  Take breadcrumbs, some garlic, fry in some olive oil until golden, add herbs, dump in a bowl of pasta and mix to serve and add some more oil before serving.  It's classic Italian!
904 2018-06-26 22:01:12 It's already the case in micro terms as we see ppl living at margins mainly in service industry jobs which dont pay well.
905 2018-06-26 22:01:07 I need to re up on some tea tree oil.
906 2018-06-26 22:01:05 No it didn't make me sleepy at all. The oil just tastes like shit and the bud is gross to smoke lol
907 2018-06-26 22:01:04 Hello @Oil_Guns_Merica you’d be perfect for this
908 2018-06-26 22:00:59 Extremely serious!! Many of us have supported this company since day one, based on figures and dates presented (plenty of interviews/presentations to refer back too) and nothing has come to fruition. We understand delays, but this is just beyond a joke now.
909 2018-06-26 22:00:55 There’s a line EVERYWHERE for an oil change. Why do these things only happen to me lmao
910 2018-06-26 22:00:28 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
911 2018-06-26 22:00:21 Some really cheap ones,  I make my shampoo myself, Shea butter, olive oil, coconut and water in a spray bottle for detangling, dark and lovely leave in conditioner and conditioner.
912 2018-06-26 22:00:10 Trump is a master at manipulating media by saying outrageous things. The purpose is to distract us from Congress dismantling regulations for oil and coal.

914 2018-06-26 22:00:00 You have a lot to complain about, but also for political reasons because of oil, I said that we have taken him
915 2018-06-26 21:59:56 Well, first of all, he is pretty supportive of Deancas lately, like even encouraging the audience to write Deancas oil rig fanfiction and second, well, the mayor was there, he was practically cornered with no way out. You can see how uncomfortable he is posing with the book.
916 2018-06-26 21:59:43 I absolutely see the oil bounce and credit the industry. It has always been boom/bust. That’s why the need to diversify. I credit the NDP for not hitting the panic button and jumping right to austerity, like the PC’s/Wildrose/UCP would have.
917 2018-06-26 21:59:26 Gonna do an extended list 
Grime - Boylan &amp; Oil Gang - Murder one
Jungle- Remarc - R.I.P
Garage - Sticky - Triplets 

Just wanna hear the sub on those out of that type of soundsystem  there's loads more but I'll stick to those 3
918 2018-06-26 21:59:25 U.S. court dismisses climate change lawsuits against oil companies
919 2018-06-26 21:59:22 First of all it's pronounced canola oil, disrespectful
920 2018-06-26 21:59:13 LOL, I remember when I was just a kid, standing next to Waren Agor in the pits, he turns to me and says (about his co driver) a$$hole, he spun and drove back across the infield and ripped out the oil cooler....shtuf happens
921 2018-06-26 21:59:05 Only once the lowest common denominator is reached. This is where libertine econ breaks down. Yes they will not come once expense of living exceeds ones ability to earn in macro terms.
922 2018-06-26 21:58:53 B/c each country he picked has a purpose.Yemen that was for Saudi Arabia 
Iran void the deal. Because of all the rhetoric during campaign. 
Putie will take care of Iran
Libya oil plans
Venezuela for Putie oil North Korea was at the time convenient Somalia not sureSyria 4 Putie!
923 2018-06-26 21:58:49 If you're going to make a pasta salad, avoid the temptation to use jarred sauces - like @dignut always does.  Try using seasonal vegetables and use tomatoes sparingly.  Add oil, vinegar (I prefer white balsamic) and lots of herbs.  Try to avoid garlic as much as possible.
924 2018-06-26 21:58:39 If Atiku had occupied the positions Buhari occupied he would have bought the entire Africa by now through brazen theft. Right now he has shares in glo, He bought Nitel, owns intel, own oil wells, refineries, university, manufacturing companies, how did he get the money?.
925 2018-06-26 21:58:32 Someone come over and help me change my God damn oil before I drive my truck into a tree.
926 2018-06-26 21:58:26 Everyone keeps saying Post Malone should come out with his own fragrance called Post Cologne. Y'all need to stop with that shit right now. No one wants to smell or smell like patchouli oil and hot breath except for crust punks and juggalos.
927 2018-06-26 21:58:26 There's only one. The one in Orlando is called Disney Springs.
928 2018-06-26 21:58:24 So woke
929 2018-06-26 21:58:21 Me I use it to relax
930 2018-06-26 21:57:50 I just need a man who will rub me up with some body oil
931 2018-06-26 21:57:41 Also explain to me how splicing different strains when creating medical marijuana can relieve pain while reducing all psychoactive effects. God forbid my bike who experiences violent seizures everyday take Cannabis oil which reduce them by 95%
932 2018-06-26 21:57:40 Kuma wlh har yanzu bai daina ba. I don’t watch football infact i hate it, just this time that I watched see what happened 
933 2018-06-26 21:57:26 The oil gets on my nerves so much but my fro is so soft. I cant get rid of it 
934 2018-06-26 21:57:25 @pelindaba uses #palmoil in their products. Palm oil leads to deforestation and the loss of critical habitat for #orangutan #elephants and #Rhino. Buy #lavender products from companies who dont use palm oil.
935 2018-06-26 21:57:24 I thought it was a combination of oil, gas, & grazing land. Trump complained that they were too big. These monuments are beautiful! Drilling for oil & gas will tear up landscape & create erosion. Grazing cattle rip out the roots of the grass, causing erosion too. Save parks!
936 2018-06-26 21:57:21 Yeah, right, it's basically just a tincture mixed with coconut oil.
937 2018-06-26 21:57:01 I love oil on canvas paintings
938 2018-06-26 21:57:00 Block grants don’t adjust for economic recessions. We often have them in Texas when the rest of the country doesn’t (oil, trade, agriculture, etc.). (2)
939 2018-06-26 21:56:51 no more up for oil. just go back to 65$

943 2018-06-26 21:55:54 Been waiting a damn hour and a half waiting to get my oil changed and they haven’t even started on my car yet
944 2018-06-26 21:55:50 I like to dump the oil and chew on that sweet sweet peanut sand.
945 2018-06-26 21:55:50 I voted Trump.
 I support Trump. 
Do some of the things he says make me cringe? YES THEY DO. 
BUT, my desire to not be ruled over by leftists outweighs their desire to do so, hopefully.
946 2018-06-26 21:55:33 Don’t kid yourself. Trump won because less than half the nation bought barrels of his snake oil and Russia. Plain and simple.
947 2018-06-26 21:55:24 What are some good tanning oils/tanning lotions? I currently use the  deep tanning oil by banana boat! Just wanted to see if there’s any better ones??

You won't because he's destroying the EPA allowing coal dust dumping in previously pristine rivers, allowing Oil companies to drill off our...
954 2018-06-26 21:54:50 @PurpulHair has an oil specifically for your hairline and hair growth. Check out their page and get yours
955 2018-06-26 21:54:44 I don’t disagree with an entire party but will never support a man who denies climate change, thinks dumping oil in the ocean is fine, and believes there such thing as “beautiful clean coal”

958 2018-06-26 21:54:26 I loved the merger. Problem w RRX was they didn't have funds to develop Duvernay. Problem w BTE was balance sheet (and overexposure to CDN heavy if we're being picky). Now they get all 3. Development of a light oil play in Duvernay AND an improved balance sheet.
959 2018-06-26 21:54:18 So I got this new organic coconut oil shampoo/conditioner/leave in treatment & I just used it for the first time & WOW my hair is so soft

963 2018-06-26 21:53:26 1- why do you think Russia and Saudi Arabia are pushing for production increase? To fill Iran’s missing oil.
2- If Iran blocks the strait of Hormuz it gives the best chance to US and its allies in the region to attack and destroy Iran’s infra structures.
964 2018-06-26 21:53:19 If you ask me, Hezbollah had better watch it's own backyard.  Oh and about Saudi Arabia, they are doing just fine.  Taking some steps to the future.  And finally just today, countries are going to be asked to stop the Iranian oil imports or exports.
965 2018-06-26 21:53:16 Not even as Europe's largest oil producer? Europes largest Renewables producer, UKs largest fishing catch and significantly sized in the EU, and producing 40% of energy to the UK national grid? I think EU negotiations would be immediate as they had already confirmed.
966 2018-06-26 21:53:15 Going to get lemons, basil, mayo, and olive oil to make an aoli sauce...

979 2018-06-26 21:52:29 Isn’t switching towards the SUV market the exact same mistake GM made several years ago. Betting on oil price surges and gas guzzlers eventually bankrupt the company. Inability to foresee oil as a cyclical market. $F

988 2018-06-26 21:51:56 I just needed an oil change but the guy kept calling people over to my car so I was afraid something was very wrong
989 2018-06-26 21:51:54 Do lib bros step to you in this manner?

992 2018-06-26 21:51:39 The kids have quite mild symptoms but still slightly agitated with it! I flipping woke up wheezing the other morning, (I blame the pollen)! I'll look into the krill oil too. Seriously check out the local honey though...
993 2018-06-26 21:51:35 Given the # of livestock Somalia exports, we ought to have cheese factory every corner-it’d be pradise having all kinds of cheeses on pasta, pizza, sandwiches, salads, pita breads w/cheese dipped in olive oil & pepper. We’ve the tools-the gov can encourage such massive enterprise
994 2018-06-26 21:51:20 Makes you wonder. Also why do we import ANY oil?
995 2018-06-26 21:51:12 I'm not one for conspiracies but I bet dick energy is being suppressed by big oil.
996 2018-06-26 21:51:08 Yu nighas work at the oil refinery ain’t where I’m tryna b @03Greedo
997 2018-06-26 21:51:02 I'm currently stalking an entry point in $BTE. Actually put a bid in today, but then the news came out and all oil stocks popped. Would have been earlier, but it's been kind of in the penalty box after the merger. Personally I loved $RRX and BTE pre-merger, so I'm all over it.

999 2018-06-26 21:50:57 There was no racism or some biased shit. Eagles played below average. Argentina wasn't at their best, counter attack opportunities was misused. It was a total fuck up play. Like frying dodo with care so hot oil doesn't splash on you.
1000 2018-06-26 21:50:52 I keep getting more and more anxious each day that goes by..... i just want my oil change done already
1001 2018-06-26 21:50:46 jfc, these protection agencies are going to have to step it up.
1002 2018-06-26 21:50:40 How about banning the SAUDI ARABIANS.... 18 of the 9/11 terrorists were from that country... u know what Trump wont ever do this because MONEY OIL MONEY... OIL....HYPOCRITE...  TRUMP HOTELS... HOTELS AND MORE HOTELS... SHAMEFUL
1003 2018-06-26 21:50:38 Lovely thanks sweet!!  Oil is fab - hope you're having lots!  Get better soon Steve - we insist!!  
1004 2018-06-26 21:50:09 Just played: a3 - topdown dialectic - topdown dialectic(peak oil)
1005 2018-06-26 21:50:08 Trump transforming God's Oil Party into a deficit-loving free-trade-hating pussy-grabbing horde was a trick, but if he can successfully make rednecks hate Harley-Davidson, he's further into cult leader territory than we calculated. If they start Keurig-smashing bikes, watch out!
1006 2018-06-26 21:50:03 About to go to sleep and Grace casually drops Albas oil all over her pillow... #extra 
1007 2018-06-26 21:49:52 Obama’s intention were to move away from fossil fuels in to cleaner energy. Republicans did what they could to strangle that. Surely a coal miner out of work could’ve gotten a job in the new energy sector. It was the right thing to do but big oil coal business has too much power.
1008 2018-06-26 21:49:51 Hey man - I worked on an oil rig and the manager was a 69-70yr old guy who told me he'd bagged every Munro - a fit old sod indeed
1009 2018-06-26 21:49:50 I’m ready to marry my doctor/lawyer/pharmacist/engineer/surgeon/CEO/COO/oil tycoon/dentist etc etc

1014 2018-06-26 21:49:14 Would that be Iain " How would an oil fund be financed?" Gray. Scottish Labour's lateral thinker &  James "Has Lord Advocate taken legal advice before appearing here today?" Kelly.
It is quite evident that those 2 muppets are a failed product of a failed Labour Education system.
1015 2018-06-26 21:49:12 Gold still moving down, made almost 4% on oil today. Currently holding twitter but will sell and trade square

1018 2018-06-26 21:49:03 Here's my issue with this RT Segs:  

NDP come into power, the AB economy nosedives, every NDP supporter is quick to blame the price of Oil, not the gov't.

The price of oil rebounds & every NDP supporter now ignores the oil bounce & credits the gov't.  Can't have it both ways.
1019 2018-06-26 21:49:00 Coconut oil!!
1020 2018-06-26 21:48:58 Cleanly does count the oil spills like  keystone right after it opened there have been a couple in Alaska but this administration put an order out they can’t report it. How is that legal? If you look at the statistics we are now polluting the are and water more than 2 years ago
1021 2018-06-26 21:48:56 polishing grit in the oil works pretty good if you can get under the hood
1022 2018-06-26 21:48:56 We need to send bulk shipments of Fish Oil and B-12 to Ruth Bader Ginsburg, STAT!
1023 2018-06-26 21:48:44 Try cbd oil on her. It should help with the seizures

1025 2018-06-26 21:48:40 "Top experts discussing" never changes anything. The people have to take the lead by boycotting unsustainable items. BAN palm oil to send a message to rainforest exploiters: the planet is NOT for sale!
1026 2018-06-26 21:48:33 We also tried the CBD with Dixie for her anxiety and it had a bit of a benefit. Both pups love the oil mixed with peanut butter. Senior dogs are great dogs.
1027 2018-06-26 21:47:50 When i was a kid our mothers cocked using lard and dripping.

Olive oil is a huge change to that
1028 2018-06-26 21:47:44 Why is @POTUS encouraging Middle East, specifically the Saudis, to ramp-up Oil Production, to bring down price of gasoline?  Why isn't @realDonaldTrump encouraging American Domestic Production of Oil/Gas to make the $ here, and produce good paying Oil Field Jobs in America? #MAGA
1029 2018-06-26 21:47:43 I’ve been using the body shop’s tea tree oil and it reduced the redness & growth but it doesn’t really make it go away :/ might have to switch brands

1033 2018-06-26 21:47:14 Snake oil salesmen might have some human qualities
1034 2018-06-26 21:47:14 Given the booming USA economy, the high oil prices, the peace deal with North Korea, the forceful way Trump Tomahawked Syria, and with Israel's support, the GOP will keep control until at least 2525.

1037 2018-06-26 21:47:01 I usually side with you @MeanwhileinCana  but I disagree that this pipeline isn't needed. It's capacity is guaranteed for 20 years. Our oil is profitable again. I don't hear any complaining about Enbridge pipeline heading east from Edmonton to Manitoba.
1038 2018-06-26 21:46:59 Oil got on my foot so if I slip and die that's what happened
1039 2018-06-26 21:46:59 Ha! Cheers Mel! Here, have some oil (it's normally a lot darker)

1048 2018-06-26 21:45:54 So they “bake” in the oil without cooking anything?

1051 2018-06-26 21:45:35 I do a lot of gun shows all around Texas oil country and would love to use a Tesla pickup for transport. However, the lack of supercharger and destination charger support out here would be a huge issue. If you want a truck to break into Texas, you have to eliminate range anxiety
1052 2018-06-26 21:45:27 .@RSPOtweets still certifies conflict palm oil linked to rainforest destruction. This has to stop now #EURT2018

1064 2018-06-26 21:44:10 Oh no :(
I'm sending all the love and healing vibes to Molly! Can you get CBD oil up there? I know we gave some (specifically for dogs) to Shiloh and it's helped her out with her leg pain.
1065 2018-06-26 21:44:09 Did you forget about slavery and the oil we took?
1066 2018-06-26 21:44:00 Looks like market manipulation to keep oil artificially high.
1067 2018-06-26 21:43:57 That’s what they Want.

1070 2018-06-26 21:43:38 I think going forward, it will be harder to find a loser then a winner in depreciated Canadian energy if the momentum stays or remains.  $BTE seems interesting now w/ exposure in Eagle Ford & Alberta, market hated M/A in a low oil $ envio but that will probably change if prices +
1071 2018-06-26 21:43:34 Tips
- use any natural oil

- use lip scrubs ( homemade lip scrub: coconut oil and brown sugar)

-apply chapstick daily

1072 2018-06-26 21:43:33 Basically-Norway want to change energy sources. EU ask the Russians to go in and occupy Norway til oil/gas is switched on. Russia stays and a political fight ensues to free Norway!
1073 2018-06-26 21:43:32 It was like looking at an oil painting
1074 2018-06-26 21:43:30 Who exactly was the snake oil salesman who told all these idiots that a constitutional republic (which is a type of democracy) is somehow mutually exclusive with democracy?
1075 2018-06-26 21:43:27 After washing my hands w/ soap, I use my forehead oil to moisturize my hands.
1076 2018-06-26 21:43:26 Nothing to do with Germany,  just good old fashioned British financial mismanagement and classic house price boom and bust ... followed by the oil crisis

1098 2018-06-26 21:40:58 Saudi Arabia was not on the Obama era list of countries that the Trump Administration used for the travel ban, and I agree that the US is far too cosy with the Saudis 'because oil'.
1099 2018-06-26 21:40:41 One issue with palm oil is it is often easier to cut down virgin forest for new plantations, rather than deal with the complicated ownership issues that come with already degraded land. Another is that while some communities can benefit from plantations, others can suffer.
1100 2018-06-26 21:40:35 No-stir peanut butter, aka enjoy this jar of oil
1101 2018-06-26 21:40:35 If CBD oil is taken off Schedule 1 and placed in schedule 2-5 it would allow  legitimate research to be done for a variety of other ailments that CBD has anecdotal evidence for therapy

That was my first thought after reading headline.
1103 2018-06-26 21:40:27 If a women kissed me I wouldn’t give a shit. I’d probably laugh. She should take all the kisses she can get...not exactly an oil painting. She’s probably one of them lesbians or whatever they call em these days

1110 2018-06-26 21:40:00 Reading War Storm while I get my oil changed probably a bad idea 
1111 2018-06-26 21:39:59 Lush products do wonders for your skin, also use tea tree oil to spot treat pimples!
1112 2018-06-26 21:39:52 IMO CNY oil effort is matter of nat sec for China; not allowing successful CNY oil/gas is matter of nat sec for US.

1115 2018-06-26 21:39:48 Meray bhai capacity 26 K hai na? But generation varies according how much we can spend on oil to make electricity. N league kept on piling up circular debt, made electricity and, falsely claimed they have added 10 k into the system... Ab samhaj aayee?

1120 2018-06-26 21:39:02 Well, Soviets were the main supplier of Germanys oil up until Barbarossa, so they wanted to cut competition to sell more, you're saying? Anyway they pushed all their neutral neighbours&forced them to seek German protection
1121 2018-06-26 21:39:01 The fact is, we didn't. We were one of the worst performing economies, riddled with strikes and poverty. We were on a clear path to be in need of humanatarian aid. Despite our natural coal, oil and gas reserves. Now depleted.

But you seem to have short memory.

1137 2018-06-26 21:37:58 Olive oil is most often used in the “Blue Zones.” Evidence shows that olive oil consumption increases good cholesterol and lowers bad cholesterol. In Ikaria, we found that for middle-aged people, about six tablespoons of olive oil daily seemed to cut the risk of dying in half.

1157 2018-06-26 21:35:38 Palm oil provides over 1/3 of world’s vegetable oil, from 10% of the land used for all oil crops. Used in foods eaten by half humanity + about 1/4 used in cosmetics, cleaning products & biofuel. Stronger action needed to ensure new palm oil plantations do not cause deforestation
1158 2018-06-26 21:35:24 They don’t want us.  They want our money and our oil and our whisky and our fish and our water and our energy...  we are a byproduct of getting all of that.
1159 2018-06-26 21:35:21 They will say 12m bpd to keep Trump quiet but won’t come close to these numbers on a consistent basis. My fear is that we may be in for a big price spike for the next 12 months regardless of OPEC+ efforts to calm nerves. This is what happens when oil is at $40 with no capex.

1210 2018-06-26 21:29:39 Lmao thank you. I usually get the actual “oil change required” message but never my check engine light so I was concerned.
1211 2018-06-26 21:29:37 use a sunscreen/lotion/oil with a lower spf. you’ll tan quicker but still have good protection with spf between 4-15. if you’re already pretty tan, go for a lower spf.

That was probably the last vehicle that got that kind of personal attention, though

1259 2018-06-26 21:23:43 Not sure that will be enough to feed you if the lorries can't get through post Brexit! I like my tomatoes with olive oil and a bit of black pepper: where am I going to source in the coming years?
1260 2018-06-26 21:23:42 I wish, just once, this would happen somewhere I’m at
1261 2018-06-26 21:23:41 And no shirt. 
1262 2018-06-26 21:23:13 I'm hoping 
Couldn't check the rad for oil as too hot but the coolant expansion pipe looks to have been blowing 
Thought something was odd before I sent it out so checked oil
Shoulda checked rad too... doh!
1263 2018-06-26 21:22:51 Is baby oil a good lube for anal?
1264 2018-06-26 21:22:49 I cannot believe how CBD hemp oil has changed my life!

1267 2018-06-26 21:22:39 Complains that their $3 oil filter is made in Mexico. Complains again when the US made filter is $12. Pick one.
1268 2018-06-26 21:22:36 In USA bereiten sich einige Städte seit Jahren auf den Oil Pick vor, dass sie so autark wie möglich sein werden.
1269 2018-06-26 21:22:35 I’m the worlds worst girlfriend. Order Chinese for the 3 of us just to remember after I didn’t specify to not cook in nut oil. My boyfriend is really allergic to nuts.  now dealing with a very poorly and upset little man 
1270 2018-06-26 21:22:32 Humanity's demand for vegetable oils is just too huge. Alternative oil crops to palm oil (soy, corn, rape) require up to 9 times as much land. Switching to them could result in the destruction of wild habitat (& biodiversity) in other parts of the world such as Brazil & Argentina
1271 2018-06-26 21:22:21 I was thinking about this today. Ignore the package instruction and always steal frozen dumpling before you fry them. Don’t skimp on the oil, either. You’re just frying for the crispy texture.
1272 2018-06-26 21:22:17 dead ass used vegetable oil as tanning oil 
1273 2018-06-26 21:22:12 If you used new Mobil 1 annual protection, you wouldnt have to. Protects your engine for one year with just one oil change
1274 2018-06-26 21:22:00 Only in a corporate structure outside of China. Seriously not really. No 7nm miners from them. Chinese miners are going to get crowded out. Big money is coming in. Like they did in the fracking revolution for oil. That’s billions.
1275 2018-06-26 21:21:50 Cal, you’re a fraud!  You never once changed, or caused to have changed, the oil in your poor old long-suffering Toyota!
1276 2018-06-26 21:21:46 Not so fun fact—Coal, oil, and gas produced on US public lands is be 5th largest carbon emitter in the world. Thanks for the knowledge @sallyjewell @EUintheUS #SeeChangeUSEU
1277 2018-06-26 21:21:46 It can be trying at times. I sometimes use an oil filter wrench. Or a good laugh with friends who love you. 
1278 2018-06-26 21:21:45 getting my oil changed and the guy tells me he has something to show me... .  . there were GNAWED CHICKEN BONES ON MY ENGINE. AN ANIMAL HAS BEEN LIVING. IN. MY. ENGINE. WUT

1284 2018-06-26 21:21:21 I like that oil looks all shiny
1285 2018-06-26 21:21:15 I’m drink water. You skin thinks your skin ain’t hydrated enough so it produces more oil.
1286 2018-06-26 21:21:08 Now that would be a video worth watching!

1293 2018-06-26 21:20:35 Obi Mikel said they would die with Argentina on the pitch. He doesn't no that modern football is not power only but technique and skill. Africa needs absolute tutoring. Football is not crude oil.
1294 2018-06-26 21:20:30 About $0.58 per L in New Mexico. We also have some of the lowest prices in the US we also produce a lot of oil and gas here.
1295 2018-06-26 21:20:30 Oil hit $70./Barrel today. Example: You own 10% of a well producing 100 barrels/day, your investment $10,000.
Well Revenue..$70X100=$7,000./DAY X 30 Days =$210,000. Or 10% Ownership= $21,000./month. You get investment back in ONE month. Example Only. Risks

1297 2018-06-26 21:20:29 @kojoshow The Mullein is a medicinal plant native to the west. The flowers extracted in olive oil with garlic cure ear infections. The leaves clear mucous from the lungs. Look at herbal remedies and you will find it in remedies for these two afflictions. It's harmless and useful.

1301 2018-06-26 21:20:12 Oh my. Not aging too well. Destroying the oil and gas economy, must be taking its toll.

1304 2018-06-26 21:19:59 #MeToo 

but what did you expect, this is exactly what Mad MaxiPad Waters was calling for and the MSM gave her the platform to call for it NationWide
1305 2018-06-26 21:19:49 OH, I get it. He is trying to force other countries by threatening sanctions on them unless they buy American oil. This is beginning to look more like grounds for real wars rather than trade wars.
1306 2018-06-26 21:19:46 If it was the North that had Oil, they would have seceded since independence tbh and we'd probably be better off for it.
1307 2018-06-26 21:19:45 “Olive oil is too Fuckn expensive” @shmaxxtypical
1308 2018-06-26 21:19:44 This is not 1900 or 1960 even. We are a post industrial country. Westward expansion ended in late 19th century. One reason for low wages is service econ which doesn't pay well.
1309 2018-06-26 21:19:43 I'm fryng some fish fillets and the frying pan decided to bukkake me with oil right in the fucking neck. Fucking oooowwwww!!!
1310 2018-06-26 21:19:41 He also likes Texas oil donors. #ReElectNelson #SendScottPacking
1311 2018-06-26 21:19:39 Who the hell he thinks he is? He is like... I order all countries to stop importing oil from Iran! In the end Trump's supporters think that is cool, but when that backfires... We'd like to see what they think.

1315 2018-06-26 21:19:06 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…
1316 2018-06-26 21:18:57 Yes we forgot so had to keep stopping to let shears cool. We didn’t burn the Alpaca as we knew our mistake and just took our time with loads of clipper oil.
1317 2018-06-26 21:18:52 That blonde secret service lady tho. She can get it.
1318 2018-06-26 21:18:41 It was my main meal and I was going to the gym so I added sunflower seeds, black rice, edamame beans and green onions. The dressing was simple and healthy - apple cider vinegar and olive oil (we Palestinians literally drink olive oil)
1319 2018-06-26 21:18:37 That's not good news if she's been boiled but I'd imagine she'd have smoke and starting problems and maybe oil in the rad and all sorts of crap, might just be an ageing gasket on the sump or something..
1320 2018-06-26 21:18:31 Osht 
I mean honestly I just added some spicy oil and it made the shit go from some regular tomato pasta 

to some SPICY tomato pasta
1321 2018-06-26 21:18:29 She’s a stripper who sells videos of herself rubbing oil into her tits while riding inflatable flamingos.
1322 2018-06-26 21:18:17 @briamgilbert I've been playing picross so much that my fingers don't slide easily across my phone anymore. There's no oil left. My fingerprints have blank spaces. This is your fault.
1323 2018-06-26 21:18:08 Luckily just an oil change! In + out really quick but that conversation was amazing.
1324 2018-06-26 21:18:05 Noo they're for all the time. Also the olive oil here tastes like heaven hence the bread dipping
1325 2018-06-26 21:18:02 Povetkin has serious money behind him , i would actually say he has bigger $$$ behind him than AJ does .....he’s backed by an oil and gas tycoon multi billionaire ....and the mob lol
1326 2018-06-26 21:17:54 No.  That is wild speculation based on nothing.  You do not know what was in the Canada-China FIPA - no one does. It's a huge stretch to believe a pipeline was guaranteed. There's no evidence China even wants any more of our oil. That theory being floated is completely baseless.
1327 2018-06-26 21:17:44 I swear I’m about to stop smoking and get into this CBD oil...sick of woods fr
1328 2018-06-26 21:17:40 The girl changing my oil is cute as fuck bro I bet she could kick my ass

1330 2018-06-26 21:17:23 i need an ADVANCE with my paycheck this oil change is EXPENSIVE

1337 2018-06-26 21:16:21 Really @jiffylube your franchise in Beaverton OR just tried to charge me $47.99 for an oil change!!! #highwayrobbery
1338 2018-06-26 21:16:15 I can go on and on about it (I won’t).  But A lot of the time we spend so much time talking about humane and discriminatory aspects that we skip the economic aspect

It’s literally spending more tax payer money to remove tax revenue.  It’s fiscally unsound.
1339 2018-06-26 21:16:10 If y’all need an oil change i got you
1340 2018-06-26 21:16:04 My car new tires new oil change feel like a whole new car in these streets

1350 2018-06-26 21:15:31 If it made sense to judge fat by its nutrient density vs other fat, then fat would be the worst type of calorie to eat since it is the least nutrient dense. I put around 600 calories of butter and coconut oil in my coffee every morning
1351 2018-06-26 21:15:16 Amazing how quickly poor customer service severs the lifetime value of a given customer to a business. I’ve been going to an auto shop for 2 years for oil changes & other repairs. They moved the GM to another location. The new GM treated me very poorly. Time find a new provider.

1399 2018-06-26 21:09:21 .@cnbc - as the largest travel research company, we would tell you weakening demand will make it hard for airlines to raise fares as oil rises
1400 2018-06-26 21:09:16 This is how not to put out an oil fire 
1401 2018-06-26 21:09:14 U can say what u like,after all u don't know me,neither do u know if I can play or not,so I won't waste my time trying to prove that to you.
1402 2018-06-26 21:09:05 Absolutely...   HA!!
1403 2018-06-26 21:09:01 If anybody got a picture of oil head post it up under this post I’m trying to see something lol
1404 2018-06-26 21:09:00 If I was Muslims I would raise the hell out of oil.
1405 2018-06-26 21:08:55 Canada prepares a combination of quotas and tariffs and the U.S. presses allies to end all imports of Iranian oil by November. Seems like Trump won this one.
1406 2018-06-26 21:08:52 They knew better but they also knew their base buys any snake oil they sell.
1407 2018-06-26 21:08:51 This your moses did accordingly he brought out nigeria from russia and deliver them back to nigeria flowing with crude oil

1410 2018-06-26 21:08:40 Actually it's the other way around. Mr Whitehouse do you live in a solar efficient home? Do you use a green energy efficient car? No not an electric car,but a car that run on corn/veg oil. How about a 2.0L engine instead of 6 or 8 cylinder engines? Live what you preach.

1414 2018-06-26 21:08:30 Tomatoes. Smear them on sourdough. Add olive oil and salt. Capers if you like them.  Nothing better especially if they're fresh ugly-beautiful New Jersey tomatoes. If you add anchovies, don't add salt. Best.
1415 2018-06-26 21:08:27 Look at what this president does not what he says! He’s taking away food stamps from the very people who voted for him and who go to his rallys. He’s a snake oil salesman. When was the last time he said something we could believe? Like NEVER! @SteveSchmidtSES @MichaelAvenatti
1416 2018-06-26 21:08:27 Ethiopia will construct our roads, Sudan operate oil fields, Uganda host our refugees, Kenya host our leaders and their families,do we seriously have a country? we are sold out. #notunderjohngarang #notunderourwatch #youthfightthedevils #southsudan

1420 2018-06-26 21:08:09 I can't do oil anymore. Lol. Tried this exact thing on a tile floor and slipped and she almost broke my cock in half and I put a hairline fracture on my coccyx
1421 2018-06-26 21:08:02 Saudi Arabia us not the wealthy country it once was, no credit. Everyone has oil now. If someone in Saudi Arabia does or says something Trump doesn't like they will be banned too.this man is loyal to NO ONE.
1422 2018-06-26 21:07:53 the dog track regulators no no wait i mean the military industrial complex have been FIXING oil prices
1423 2018-06-26 21:07:51 Ahhh, makes sense. It’s all oil and gas around here, so that was my first thought.
1424 2018-06-26 21:07:51 Agreed.  Powell just needs to talk a bit hawkish to keep markets in check but do very little now.  Let the past hikes do their work plus you have high oil headwind
1425 2018-06-26 21:07:49 I'm working a double and my dad came to my job, picked up my car; took it for an oil change, then filled up my tank & cleaned & vacuumed the whole thing & dropped my car back off & offered dinner for tonight after work. #highlightofmyday
1426 2018-06-26 21:07:49 38 at best. Megan is best bird in house no brainier. Laura will overdose on Cod liver oil the old cow
1427 2018-06-26 21:07:49 Dinner idea: chicken breast seasoned w black pepper, garlic salt, &amp; bread crumbs. Squash &amp; broccoli, light olive oil. Bake 415 ~35min.
1428 2018-06-26 21:07:48 Castor oil smells something awful but, here I am, putting it on this head of mine.
1429 2018-06-26 21:07:35 Oi, you wanna fight you dirty leaf?
I’ll fight you, Greco-Roman style. With baby oil and shit.
Or not man, we can just get a beer or whatever, I’m bored and shit.
1430 2018-06-26 21:07:18 Ya know . . . Because "oil" is more important than the American lives that this "Muslim ban" is so called supposed to be protecting. 

Trump is a fraud.
1431 2018-06-26 21:07:12 for in this isle of spice what scents may come when we have shuffled past this canola oil must give us pause
1432 2018-06-26 21:07:09 Good decision, attacking the Iran would have killed innocent people, but this decision on Oil sanctions will be effective & by this they would stop funding terrorist organizations from Syria to yemen to Afghanistan. ..
1433 2018-06-26 21:07:02 Pls try hypo with Red oil
1434 2018-06-26 21:06:59 They’re not even trying to sell us REAL Jamaican castor oil anymore. The demand for it is extremely high
1435 2018-06-26 21:06:56 They deserve it,no zeal,no unity,no prowess, no fighting spirit,self gratification in expense of teams victory,look at how the Argentine fought to finish
1436 2018-06-26 21:06:55 But that’s besides the point. I can’t imagine where we would be as a country if we turned away the millions of immigrants who have come here under the same circumstances.  We have thrived from immigration, the judgment you make about these people deviates from our history

Caitlin: hurry with your makeup so I can get there! Kelley: hang on! Caitlin: my brother can change the oil in my car faster than this 
1442 2018-06-26 21:06:32 Oil companies are the only business who can raise and lower their prices 15-20% on a daily basis with no accountability. Every sitting elected official taking $ from oil lobbyists should be ashamed.
1443 2018-06-26 21:06:26 You already know black castor oil comes through with the ultimate moisturization for black hair. For daily moisture, you should invest in a spray bottle and put water, tea tree oil, jojoba, and castor. Mist your hair everyday it’s a plant
1444 2018-06-26 21:06:25 African Union, please give Africans a clear vision. Stand up for them. Africans still live in huts, lack modern hospitals, good housing, safe pregnancy and delivery. Africa has Oil,  Diamonds, Uranium, Bitumen, Gold, the wealthiest continent on Earth but the poorest people.
1445 2018-06-26 21:06:20 I just spent 15 minutes flirting with my oil change mechanic and didn’t even get a discount.
1446 2018-06-26 21:06:19 you'll remember by early 1970s the IMF were looking at bailing the UK out and it was saved from bankruptcy by Scottish oil and gas
1447 2018-06-26 21:06:18 Removing her name from a *prize* will not erase the history, I guarantee it. Consider the Native child living on the reservation reading Little House and finding "The only good Indian is a dead Indian" while her people's land is still being stolen to run leaky oil pipelines.
1448 2018-06-26 21:06:18 If there’s one thing we reuse in my household it would be frying oil 
1449 2018-06-26 21:06:16 Disgusting...good for her.
1450 2018-06-26 21:06:10 Fubar! I thought the govt had to reclassify marijuana because of the CBD coming from marijuana plants. Plus, this new Rx isn't as effective as oil when treating epilepsy.
1451 2018-06-26 21:06:06 We are the customers of the US, they do not need us (not even our oil anymore).  Truth hurts

1456 2018-06-26 21:05:37 @realDonaldTrump you have got to make a move on the price of oil this is getting out of control fast oil prices are up 17% in 2018 please stop this ASAP thanks have a great day sir love from a South Carolina Deplorable

1465 2018-06-26 21:04:56 Than the shout you for just go help them qualify na.
1466 2018-06-26 21:04:52 Constantly spitting in his allies faces, then has the temerity to today call for said allies to boycott Iranian oil! WTF
1467 2018-06-26 21:04:50 So it’s agreeable that this was not a full fledged 100% Libyan revolution.

It’s simple math with main purpose to control oil and ensure current financing structures of the Middle East were not changed. 

After that, you can argue people were angry, they always are...

1470 2018-06-26 21:04:45 Bewildering to me that future Canadian history books are going to devote whole chapters to something called the "Dairy Mafia". Nothing in the past 20 years of world politics (oil wars/climate change/terrorism) prepared me for our country committing suicide over the price of milk
1471 2018-06-26 21:04:43 Awwww honey I’m so sorryI’m sure they understand! You got anything to put in your ear? Warm oil? Hot water bottle or heating pad? That’s the worst pain in the world and I hate it for you

1479 2018-06-26 21:04:05 I was cutting jalapenos yesterday and even though I washed my hands after, I've managed to contaminate my phone and laptop with the oil, so my fingers keep burning. I've never washed my hands so much in one day. It doesn't help.
1480 2018-06-26 21:04:01 if baby oil is made from babies, and for babies, then baby oil is made by babies for babies. and i wonder if the gurber baby uses baby oil from its self. woah.
1481 2018-06-26 21:03:50 Would that have been real Labour governments and oppositions with balls and the windfall of shared Scots oil revenue. However you have now scunnered the Scots en masse and we are  not keen to share resources with incompetents and greedy nest featherers. Bye.

1483 2018-06-26 21:03:40 I use any water based spray. Leave in conditioner. I like the one in the yellow body by Dark & lovely natural line. & seal it with wild growth oil !! That shit gives my desert dry hair lasting moisture
1484 2018-06-26 21:03:40 And apparently they all suited their names! 
Oily had a black spot like an oil spot.
Statly because he was stately.
Piper because his tail was black like a pipe and
Yardy because she had a tail like a yard stick(stripy)!

1486 2018-06-26 21:03:32 The colour 'burnt sienna',often used in oil painting ,was named after the daughter of a british artist who in the 1650s started painting a portrait of his daughter'sienna',but during a sitting,a fire broke out at his studio, yet he refused to leave the room until it was finished

1490 2018-06-26 21:03:20 I appreciate Jimmy Carter 's service in the US Navy & I guess he was dealt a challenging hand after the Arab oil embargo
1491 2018-06-26 21:03:20 I found a really cool place to donate my hair that uses hair to make mats and stuff to clean up oil spills and waterways but they’re temporarily not taking donation so maybe that’s a sign I just shouldn’t cut it at all

1495 2018-06-26 21:02:23 it sorta was a) when oil was actually booming and b) if you could move up even one level past the dregs of nameless CAD monkeys all shoved into the cubicle floor.

1501 2018-06-26 21:02:02 So #Trump acted to drive #oil up $3 days before the 4th of July and the start of driving season?! That's about a $2.5 B tax by Labor Day. #oilprice #CrudeOil

About the same as an American with a 5th grade education or less. They earn a lot and pay massive sales taxes. 
1508 2018-06-26 21:00:55 My recipe has these ingredients to start:

6 C flour (or more to consistency)
2.5 C warm water
2 T yeast
1/3 C sugar
3 eggs
1/2 C oil
Plus egg wash.

This makes four loaves of the size shown.
1509 2018-06-26 21:00:48 Yeah I use the same thing and it made the skin under my eyes dry too but rinsing it off with water fixed that but I’ve also started using the indie lee squalane oil after I wash my face and my face is never dry anymore. It’s amazing 
1510 2018-06-26 21:00:46 Btw, we can agree buy 1 tonne of oil at 140 U$D and do not involve any U$D

1515 2018-06-26 21:00:23 5 you are removing tax revenue.  The ICE raids on factories or 7-11 or where people are working just remove a tax paying noncitizen from the pot;

1521 2018-06-26 20:59:56 There is more "sunk" money value in coastal real estate that will flood in coming decades than there is liquid money able to bail it out. The very basis of our currency system, that of real estate development debt and the oil burned to support it, will have to change.
1522 2018-06-26 20:59:40 The impact would be substantial for the exports, but this for the long term only.

1525 2018-06-26 20:59:32 "Sellers who take it and immediately convert it only add business for banks"

And this explains why the biggest owners of the USA debt are... Industrialized countries, not the oil producers

1531 2018-06-26 20:58:57 Rapeseed oil salad and goat cheese omelet. Beats ramen.

1538 2018-06-26 20:58:13 Mattis to Xi: big Don is not happy about you taking all that Iran oil. So go ahead and sign that trade agreement before I sic rocket man on you.
1539 2018-06-26 20:58:07 Don't forget his question about where tje money for an Oil Find would come from. 
1540 2018-06-26 20:57:59 That costs money a lot of it.  1 you are spending $ on the wall; 2. You are soending $ on it’s maintenance; 3. You are spending more $ on policing the border; 4. You are spending $ detaining people.  That plan is actually really expensive 

And...
1541 2018-06-26 20:57:58 America has been paranoid since her birth. I think it's based on guilt of genocide of the indigenous population and slavery. When you know you've done a group of people wrong you'd bound think there will be Payback. Intervention for oil has made more enemies.
1542 2018-06-26 20:57:54 STOP SAYING YOU ARE AN AWKWARD PERSON MEGAN. THERES A VIDEO OF YOU RUBBING OIL ON YOUR TITS
1543 2018-06-26 20:57:53 Energy was the best performing sector in the S&P 500 as Brent oil reversed an early fall to trade back above $76 a barrel for the first time in seven sessions.  FT

1547 2018-06-26 20:57:17 Saudi Arabia - were cashing out on all our oil while we still can
1548 2018-06-26 20:57:15 Until OPEC and Nigeria give us enough oil, we’ll do whatever 
1549 2018-06-26 20:57:04 A question I've pondered all day.  The Indian central bank has instructed not to process oil payments in euros.  Some kind of barter deal I guess?  What else is there?
1550 2018-06-26 20:57:03 Can I rub the post shave oil over it
1551 2018-06-26 20:57:02 She has the best oil for very ill people. She’s not racist.
1552 2018-06-26 20:57:01 He's just mad at Turkey because they shut down his ilegal oil smuggling operation.
1553 2018-06-26 20:56:48 @realDonaldTrump President, you can not afford to lower the oil prices. 
1554 2018-06-26 20:56:43 cottage cheese + nice olive oil + salt/pepper with rosemary Triscuits is the most superior snack

1557 2018-06-26 20:56:31 Debbie does Dallas.   The original was about oil
1558 2018-06-26 20:56:30 If Syrian blood was oil, all the world's countries would be fighting over letting IN refugees.
1559 2018-06-26 20:56:20 I remember that before I got into trading and oil, I used to spend time battling the right-wing "libertarian" zero hedge cult members online on their bull shit. Now I realize I was fighting bots. I noticed the programmers moved those bots to sell for the Trump team to use.
1560 2018-06-26 20:56:12 When a woman all shaved and smooth I love to rub her down with coconut oil and slide her down the hallway like a curling stone
1561 2018-06-26 20:55:45 The good news- the stock market has had 2 up days out of the last 3.
The bad news- it's because oil has gone up by $5 a barrel in the last week.

1578 2018-06-26 20:54:55 If Trump places sanctions on Iran for reasons related to oil, Islamic state terrorists might begin their hostage taking all over again in exchange for ransoms. Trump won't be able to call their hostage taking as human rights violations nor terrorist related now.

1608 2018-06-26 20:52:42 Oil spike ahead. This is reminiscent of the time in The Long Short when default rates in NINJA mortgages contained within the CTOs started hitting double figures but financial institutions carried on regardless.

1612 2018-06-26 20:52:16 It’s a little off topic David, but I would much prefer to generate revenue from immigrants (documented or not) rather than deport or support them.  

I’m pretty sure if we streamline the immigrations laws to be what they once were, we would reap the rewards of the county

1617 2018-06-26 20:51:53 Ok soooo TYPICALLY my foundation would be creasing on my smile lines, and my nose would be shiny by now. But today I used Milanis’ setting spray...... holy grail for sure. I have no creasing and no oil ANYWHERE.
1618 2018-06-26 20:51:53 So why don't I keep the oil ....since you have the population....the hard working productive populace
1619 2018-06-26 20:51:44 Zero Hedge is only good for crude inventories within a minute or two of being released. Other than that, they tend to just be a right-wing "libertarian" crackpot site. Take that into consideration when reading what they present.
1620 2018-06-26 20:51:44 When I searched "romantic painting" into eBay, I was more looking for the 18th-19th century art style and not an expressionist oil rendering of somebody getting rammed in the ass.

1638 2018-06-26 20:49:47 Oh Lord, there is a white BMW 740Li blowing white smoke out when they accelerate. That is not good. Means there is not enough oil. Make sure you all check your oil levels and change it when required. Your engine will thank you
1639 2018-06-26 20:49:44 First thing you need to understand is that we are all guessing. Byron like me has made some good and some bad calls. No one knows. Canada is 3% of the world. A small rounding error. When oil collapsed in 2014-16 no recession. Hard to see it happen without the US taking us down.

1653 2018-06-26 20:48:17 S/O to @Chase for refunding my money back from when that pussy ass hoe tried to charge me multiple times for my oil change over at Vavoline. One thing I can say is that Chase don't play about they money!

1819 2018-06-26 20:32:13 Bro you have no clue how important Oil and Gas is. We use 22 million barrels a day for fuels and plastics. Be the first and give it all up including the iPhone. Nothing is as efficient as Oil nothing can match the cost nothing!!! Green Energy is a joke.

1823 2018-06-26 20:32:07 Dear #McKinleyVillage inhabitants: there are "no left turn" signs for a reason. They are there so that drivers do not mess up the oil on the street for resurfacing. Don't ever complain about imperfections on the road if you're part contributor. #EastSac #EastSacramento #ElvasAve
1824 2018-06-26 20:31:58 The USA also fought two world wars against white nations. It's never fought in the name of 'whites' surely. It's mostly been against communism and oil and lately Islamic terrorism, misguided in some instances, but not in the name of 'whites'
1825 2018-06-26 20:31:52 Venezuelans  because of their oil? No Guatemalana, or Hindurans though, is that right?

1828 2018-06-26 20:31:48 When you want to complain about the time length of your oil change because the entire dealership was distracted by the World Cup, but your husband texts a 15 page essay about Messi and Argentina or something.....#priorites @QuoteDCraven
1829 2018-06-26 20:31:10 But remember when you drank oil thinking it was oj

1832 2018-06-26 20:31:03 And I’m printing out the insane tweets and sharing with my Independent Registered friends who aren’t on Twitter.
1833 2018-06-26 20:31:01 PSA to kitty owners. Essential oil diffusers can poison your cat. Cats are attracted to the sweet smell, but the oils can burn their skin, cause vomiting and liver failure as well as seizures.
1834 2018-06-26 20:30:58 Venzuela oil companies- which ended the Fuel Assistance oil coming to Massachusetts for low-income elderly. THESE ARE MOB PAYOFFS OR PAYING RUSSIA WITH OUR MONEY @FBI
1835 2018-06-26 20:30:47 There is no common ground.  There is only our laws to be enforced.
1836 2018-06-26 20:30:29 Regulate the palm oil production to minimise biodiversity loss
1837 2018-06-26 20:30:22 Trump has been spoiled by dealing with Mideast Autocrats. He expects everyone to praise him and act stupid like Saudi & UAE princes. 
Ordering US businesses to produce where he wants them to. Expect China & India to stop oil Imports from China.
1838 2018-06-26 20:30:21 I have had the worst night ever  first I burnt my finger on hot fryer oil then I dropped a piping hot lasagna on my hand.

1849 2018-06-26 20:29:02 Saudi Arabia and America has some weapon and oil and country like Yemen are not
1850 2018-06-26 20:28:59 Most libs dont care what gov costs or who gets what until it's not them, like debt/ deficit now. Under Obama they nvr squawked about extra 10 billion or so
1851 2018-06-26 20:28:57 Sindh has oil, gas, water, agriculture, a port and a young and educated populace. Sindh is also Pakistan’s commercial centre. So stop being condescending. If Sindh awakes Pakistan will tremble.
1852 2018-06-26 20:28:51 I believe that yesterday the Scottish Affairs Committee met with senior oil industry bods in Aberdeen & that @RossThomson_MP was told how difficult Brexit will be for supply chain companies in the North East. When is he going to stand up against the Tory vision of a hard #Brexit
1853 2018-06-26 20:28:47 I've heard him talk about how we should take Iraq's oil, just seemed out of context in his stream of accomplishments.
1854 2018-06-26 20:28:46 Today we had demos to stop! Oil transportation since the government have failed to sort out insecurty issues.

1857 2018-06-26 20:28:16 PUC has spent a couple hours drilling down on #Enbridge pledge to remove sections of #Line3 at landowner request. After break will shift discussion to potential route of #oil #pipeline. PUC chair stresses: "We have not made a decision about the certificate of need!"

1860 2018-06-26 20:28:03 We are fooled. They siphon oil And Gas feom libya And middle finger East And Then sing to us How USA has oil. Go Tell It to the birds
1861 2018-06-26 20:27:35 I find that comment to be amazing the United States has no problem sticking his nose into the politics of other countries when we need their fucking oil but when they are people are coming here illegally fleeing violence we have nothing to say
1862 2018-06-26 20:27:30 He’s actually being somewhat sane here. But the libs are having NONE of that. Totally batshit meltdowns.
1863 2018-06-26 20:27:20 Pls do
1864 2018-06-26 20:27:17 Tbh I used to apply Vaseline (it has castor oil) to my eyebrows everyday at night and they've gotten darker (I wouldn't say thicker but since they got darker, it looks thicker?? u know) :)

1866 2018-06-26 20:27:05 @flyalex666 Oil > 70 wow
1867 2018-06-26 20:27:02 The fossil fuel industry think humans can live on sand, without water or clean air and eat oil 3 meals a day.
1868 2018-06-26 20:26:57 5) Favoritism on offshore oil drilling (there need to be a uniform set of rules)
6) Relaxing "fiduciary standard" rules for stockbrokers
7) Supporting various GOP health-care fixes which do not address actual issues with ACA.
8) Not labeling food products that use GMO's.
1869 2018-06-26 20:26:50 You must want high tax rate , oil price to go up , gas price to raise. Oh not to forget  produce on demand do to farms don’t have enough employees to work the fields. You can’t build a wall with out  it’s got to come from somewhere like your pay checks, And raising prices
1870 2018-06-26 20:26:47 You can't compel someone. And dont tell me getting a loan proves me wrong. You have no right to a loan and can turn it over or not. Your choice
1871 2018-06-26 20:26:38 Declared! - A #Trump administration official told @business that it is pressing its allies to cease importing Iranian oil by November 4 of this year, or else face a variety of U.S. sanctions.
1872 2018-06-26 20:26:33 Lev9:4  Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you.  #BibleVerse
1873 2018-06-26 20:26:31 Don't think that's going to happen at Chick-fil-A.
1874 2018-06-26 20:26:28 Wrong yet again.  All that proves is that you WERE legal at some point.  Not a permanent status.  Again, if we want to identify people who belong here, why not a national ID????
1875 2018-06-26 20:26:25 Malam Kama kanka bfr I change am fr u,I dey vex like this
1876 2018-06-26 20:26:15 I always put tea tree oil on them drinks more I can't bare calling up again telling Peter that I'm in the lab coat. #lcsa
1877 2018-06-26 20:26:10 He really stupid. Saudi Arabia has agreed to increase oil production to lower prices. We are at war with Muslim countries anyway. And look the people of Iran are starting to standup to their evil leaders. You know the ones Obama helped fund
1878 2018-06-26 20:26:08 They're not selling, they are trying to protect any good we still have left in this country. Your president is the snake oil salesman, since way before he was potus.
1879 2018-06-26 20:26:03 Thanks for the tip now i know just where to go cheaper oil from.
1880 2018-06-26 20:25:52 Hopefully no Tallahassee resident reading the inspection reports will encounter "sniper who hates  oil cans".
1881 2018-06-26 20:25:48 Pillaging & taking advantage of desperate people is topic not discussed enough as a part of & reason for wars.

I've heard someone talking about stealing a country's oil as part of war activity.
1882 2018-06-26 20:25:45 I hate coming to get oil changes by myself 
1883 2018-06-26 20:25:44 Just change my oil and let me be on my merry, plz.
1884 2018-06-26 20:25:40 My grandma's biscuits and gravy, with the gravy made with bacon fat instead of sausage fat. The biscuits were also a little crunchy on the bottom because my grandma would put a little layer of oil on bottom of pan.
1885 2018-06-26 20:25:35 It was terrible for millions who lived in slums, literally millions. Industry was riven with strike after strike, the cost of Vietnam slowed the US economy and that combined with oil shortage almost brought the UK to its knees in 1974 with three day weeks, power shortages
1886 2018-06-26 20:25:24 Yooooo lo sisi unesbindi yaz.....Kelly needs anointing oil,all pastors,prophets of this world praying all night for her .....
1887 2018-06-26 20:25:20 I look a hot mess and my hair looks so ashy. I need some oil in it. Ugh
1888 2018-06-26 20:25:02 Sad that just because a news agency out the bad policy and effects on the economy you deem it not reputable. Open your eyes man a1.2% drop in consumer spending,1.3%GDP,billions fleeing Canada,oil rigs leaving for the US. Beyond a full recession what will take for acknowledgement
1889 2018-06-26 20:25:00 I guess time will tell on what the Oil do with the contract. Chia seems to give players what they want and throw in a NMC too most of the time. I am sure if the talk of Nurse wanting a really long term deal he will likely get that.
1890 2018-06-26 20:24:59 lol, oil works too.

1893 2018-06-26 20:24:35 Getting an oil change so difficult dog
1894 2018-06-26 20:24:35 Did I hear you say zero oil economy? Where e dey?
1895 2018-06-26 20:24:20 うっぐあああああ！初仕事だったから師匠にこれは初仕事で取っていいカットなのか聞けばよかったああ！
やっぱり重かったぁ！
レイアウト始めた時もどれが重いかよく分からずに取ったりしてたなぁ……失敗から全然学んでない…
1896 2018-06-26 20:24:17 Not what I said. But yes to have a LEGAL presence to get one LEGALLY. Which would prove to a degree your NOT ILLEGAL.
1897 2018-06-26 20:24:17 I bought two bottles of vitamin e oil a couple weeks ago and I can’t find them anywhere and I don’t want to buy more 
1898 2018-06-26 20:24:17 $GWPH - CBD oil will need to be rescheduled quickly by DEA in order to get product to market.
1899 2018-06-26 20:24:14 Fuck who?
1900 2018-06-26 20:24:09 As I said, I'm going to leave this now. You are embarrassing yourself. I have a background of 30 years in telecommunications, electronics and IT, as well as a former career in oil and gas. I'm not saying that the digital age isn't happening - just not the extent you think it will
1901 2018-06-26 20:24:09 And Shannon Phillips "DID" write the forward to "AN action a day" by Mike Hudema of Greenpeace, encouraging civil disobedience towards projects like the oil sands and other capitalistic ventures. Talk about extremism....Wow..
1902 2018-06-26 20:24:08 @foundmyfitness does cbd oil reduce inflamation? How does it affect gut bactéria?
1903 2018-06-26 20:24:03 Trump is stuck in his mind loop. He wants other countries to REDUCE their oil prices by increasing their oil output so gas prices can drop while simultaneously increasing US oil output at HIGHER prices so that they can make more profits. In Trump's "mind", that makes sense.
1904 2018-06-26 20:23:53 A lot of ppl don't like them, but that's only when they're boiled & unseasoned! They're great when baked with olive oil, roasted nuts, and some blue cheese!
1905 2018-06-26 20:23:49 Well guess i am sticking with oil heat after all...estimate was not what was quoted whe they where here n has now doubled not including putting in a chimney liner...cheeze
1906 2018-06-26 20:23:46 Didn't Trump just beg for OPEC to increase oil production? Seems he wants his cake and to eat it too. Problem is, everyone else is now eating it, just not the US.
1907 2018-06-26 20:23:43 Broke: Cities suing oil companies for selling oil to ... cities
Woke: Cities banning gasoline cars, Marshall plan for bikes and transit, upzone transit corridors, convert parking & streets to other uses, destroy oil companies once and for all
1908 2018-06-26 20:23:43 Nothing like going for an oil change but then spending $500 bucks for a bunch of other stuff. But I can't complain...my car's maintenance costs have been remarkably low! @Buick
1909 2018-06-26 20:23:33 "Deforestation for palm oil frequently takes place despite legal bans."  - these people need to be SHOT. They are destroying HUMANITY.

1911 2018-06-26 20:23:15 Maradona is actually a legend. A man ended his career on coke. Spent another 20+ years on coke. Manages teams on coke. Gets fired on coke. Manages teams in Saudi Arabia for oil money to spend on more coke. He can never go broke.
1912 2018-06-26 20:23:14 CAN bought it to get the thing built. It is a needed pipe. Our oil is worth money again and it's capacity has been guaranteed for the next 20 years. I'm all for renewable energy but it's still unreliable. Oil is still king and will create more economic stimulation.
1913 2018-06-26 20:23:13 Isn’t that the  Redheaded step child that had too much goo on his lips?

1924 2018-06-26 20:22:15 A lot of what
Reasons or oil?
Enough to try and catch fire

1925 2018-06-26 20:22:14 I paint and read SciFi books. It’s good to escape to another world for a while. And when I need to I beat the shit out of a canvas with my paints and brushes. Or just throw some oil paint on and blend colors for hours. It’s amazingly stress releasing!
1926 2018-06-26 20:21:59 #NGAARG As hushpuppi said Nigeria has never done anything for me ..You don’t even have light sef ... oil rich nation ooo !! Aren’t you people Stupid??   All the oil in that Bastard county come from the delta but that’s the most under developed part !! You people are very stupid
1927 2018-06-26 20:21:57 Happening now at #WGC2018: EDF’s Chief Scientist Steve Hamburg discussing groundbreaking coordinated research to quantify methane emissions from the U.S. oil and gas industry - Room 144 A/B
1928 2018-06-26 20:21:53 That's a Superfecta - trampling the 4th, 5th, *and* 6th Amendments to own the #2A.
1929 2018-06-26 20:21:52 Of course! If you live in Selma the Selma finest smoke shop has some but if not honestly I think you can even order some online! You could do the oil but also you can do a CBD bath bomb and lotions and I love those ones a lot 
1930 2018-06-26 20:21:52 Hell rules because you can do whatever you want there! Go to hell!  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
1931 2018-06-26 20:21:36 Time for #investigative reporting? Trump is linked to Netanyahu who gave Genie energy permission to "steal" Syrian oil; happening right now. Look at the board: Rothschild (bailed Trump out of bankruptcy, W. Ross used to work for R). Cheney, Murdoch, Wolsey and others on the board
1932 2018-06-26 20:21:23 @ElizabethMay what the money is going towards like a texas oil corporation instead of green reusable energy or social programs.
1933 2018-06-26 20:21:13 His state uses a lot of illegal farm  labor
1934 2018-06-26 20:21:11 I don’t think I need to know what a paper pusher is making but I need to know the budget spent on agency.  And I do think waste is relevant.  

I think most federal employees get paid on a set scale.  Some time upper management may vary.   If I think the pay is set in stone
1935 2018-06-26 20:20:58 Wonder what Prince Alwaleed bin Talal has to say about this 70 dollar oil
1936 2018-06-26 20:20:55 Happy birthday legend. Hope it’s covered in baby oil with some carrots on the side.
1937 2018-06-26 20:20:49 Getting an oil change at @JiffyLubeIndy !
1938 2018-06-26 20:20:42 I will still try to avoid palm oil. When there are no more Orangutan in the world, I want to say at least I didn’t partake in their extinction. This fucking world :(
1939 2018-06-26 20:20:35 Sure is!! 
Top tip - take it off in the shower, the heat helps melt the adhesive a little bit making it easier and less painful to take off and if you do have a sticky residue coconut oil helps remove it 
1940 2018-06-26 20:20:33 If it's snake oil you're after, try Goop.
1941 2018-06-26 20:20:13 You should never buy these oil leaking bastards in the first place

1945 2018-06-26 20:19:48 increased scrutiny of CDA's?   maybe the parents are not behaving as other families did.  might also be big oil shills tampering with the vehicle recorder, cuz, you know, it's all a plot.
1946 2018-06-26 20:19:47 until Obama won dems were for strong borders and enforcement.  Republicans not so much pandering to U.S Chamber. Was a member till around 04. I quit cause they were pro illegal alien
1947 2018-06-26 20:19:28 Yes dear, I’m aware of that.  Perhaps I should’ve said it is partly about oil in whatever context you want to consider that to be. The point is, we both agree Saudi Arabia should be on the list, but that’s not going to happen. One of us is old enough to know that; the other isn’t
1948 2018-06-26 20:19:25 Why is Saudi Arabia not on there? The 9/11 terrorist were from there. Are we more interested in protecting oil companies and the pocketbooks of the wealthy while satisfying the hatemongers amongst us? Meanwhile, we have countries on the ban that have had no terrorists.

2013 2018-06-26 20:13:15 Also, is that why you muted olive oil? I have so many questions here.
2014 2018-06-26 20:13:14 I recommend roasting them then. Best flavor and texture to hopefully not set you against them the rest of your life. Little oil, salt, and pepper is all you need. Cut off stem bit and halve, toss with spices and oil, and roast for 45 ish min at 350-400 depending on your oven.
2015 2018-06-26 20:13:11 I think there teetering on the edge maybe a blackpudding foam and a little truffle oil to finish them off
2016 2018-06-26 20:13:11 Unfortunately they don't care about it, rather get off on the negative attention. This is like a rerun of bush/cheney  fake concern about the middle east, all they wanted was the oil money. Got it too, pipelines and all. IDK what trumpilk actually want tho, too weird those two.

Which completely nixes all tax savings for the same ave family of 4 per year. 

No #MAGA
Just stupidity.
2095 2018-06-26 20:07:06 Lol, Accutane. Just finished 6 months of it. The struggle was real but I have been DELIVERT! 

Also, I make heavy use of black African soap, tea tree oil and non-scented moisturizers always. I’m not complicated at all.
2096 2018-06-26 20:07:00 100% onboard with bringing Tobias Rieder back to Oil Country, Toby is a great dude and his potential hasn't even been scratched.
2097 2018-06-26 20:06:59 Oil a work
2098 2018-06-26 20:06:58 There is so much stupid on that thread it's ridiculous. Women that watch that show and think they're living in it are delusional and need mental help.
2099 2018-06-26 20:06:52 .@StandUpToOil started in the PNW in 2014 when they were facing 8 oil bi-rail terminal proposals and a massive pipeline proposal in BC that would bring 1M gallons of crude oil in the area every day. #KeepItInTheGround
2100 2018-06-26 20:06:42 Try coconut oil. It has more fat but it's the healthier fat because it's polyunsaturated and there's more calories! It's a lot easier too.
2101 2018-06-26 20:06:39 I heard tea tree oil helps
2102 2018-06-26 20:06:34 Because every now and then civilised people get complacent and nasty little toads like you and Trump come along and remind us there are still snake oil salesmen out there who claim to be doing it all for the little man only to shaft them. Not long now, only a court case away.
2103 2018-06-26 20:06:27 Oshamo RT @olamide_YBNL: And ah beg make dem educate the bad eggs for sars or make dem go de do farming.. we can’t rely on oil money only .
2104 2018-06-26 20:06:25 You’re a liar and a snake oil salesman. If you were a real Christian you would not be supporting the current @GOP or Trump.
2105 2018-06-26 20:06:05 And ah beg make dem educate the bad eggs for sars or make dem go de do farming.. we can’t rely on oil money only .
2106 2018-06-26 20:06:03 Anybody own a Chevy? I got a free oil change for you!
2107 2018-06-26 20:05:55 From CNBC, US state department ordered allies to halt oil imports from Iran. ORDERED ALLIES??  REALLY? Who the fuck do they think they are to order another nation to do something.
2108 2018-06-26 20:05:54 that was my first time hearing Obama speak, had never heard of him and finally saw him......pure snake oil salesman was my thoughts. Big on promises, not big on actually following thru
2109 2018-06-26 20:05:54 hey #trump lovers, get ready to pay for that love at the pump
cutting iran's oil from the world's supply is gonna hurt
2110 2018-06-26 20:05:39 They want to destroy the Constitution 
Its about power

Trump is dumping the apple cart
2111 2018-06-26 20:05:22 Definitely not starch and oil ewww
2112 2018-06-26 20:05:16 For oily skin try the bruja potion only at night. During the day it can make you feel more oily but it doesn't clog@pores at all. It's made with almond and grapeseed oil and rosemary lavender Tamanu etc. google them and check it out
2113 2018-06-26 20:05:14 Often new tech is expensive at the start. But gets cheaper with time. We lost a chance of leading some new. Think. Planet us 70% ocean. Surely tidal. Wind. Sun. Hydro. Are the future. This pury cons govt backing oil and gas over others.
2114 2018-06-26 20:05:10 Any ideas how to trade oil, gas or vix? To apply for professional trader status not for me, as my account is far from 500k.
2115 2018-06-26 20:05:07 Somebody bring me some coconut oil. 
2116 2018-06-26 20:05:06 tip: toast some nice bread, sprinkle with basil oil and serve with you favorite hummus. 
Thank me later ;)
2117 2018-06-26 20:04:59 Yeah that is not ok. Is this what Democrats want to force anyone who oppose there ideology, that they try and suppress our voices. We will not buckle just because they scream or get in our face.
2118 2018-06-26 20:04:54 I can’t even bear to go to my hell hole of a workplace cos I will acc throw hot oil at anyone that looks at me funny
2119 2018-06-26 20:04:41 Speaking of Oil, didn't you say Oil should be a lot cheaper last week. Today your state dept caused oil to jump 4% to $70 a barrel. You are screwing the American people and doing Putins work. Special place in hell for you. Wrapping yourself in a flag or bible isn't going to help
2120 2018-06-26 20:04:39 Larry the Prius is gettin a cute lil oil change and I’m feeling like a fulfilled parent— is this what motherhood feels like
2121 2018-06-26 20:04:29 Texas Hill Country Olive Oil and Bee Inc. won’t be at the market today.
2122 2018-06-26 20:04:26 this isn’t the kind of fight where we use oil, pip
2123 2018-06-26 20:04:24 Hm imo different frame types would have different colour robot pee. 
Due to coolent differences, fuel types, oil differences ect
2124 2018-06-26 20:04:23 call for　～を呼び求める、必要とする

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
2125 2018-06-26 20:04:21 Seal oil (from boiling seal fat)
2126 2018-06-26 20:04:11 Castor oil boo. My baby's Afro is soft coz of it. She's 19 months
2127 2018-06-26 20:04:05 What about wiping out another species elsewhere? Oil palm is also being increasingly grown in jaguar and West African primate habitat
2128 2018-06-26 20:03:58 I wont, i refuse to eat oil
2129 2018-06-26 20:03:57 Nerve pain is a motherfucker 
CBD oil and cream is on its way ..
If you have good health be very thankful!!
Research has been put on hold and I’m gonna take a few days off coming up .
2130 2018-06-26 20:03:49 I would first get the battery tested (any pep boys will do it as part of a complimentary inspection when you get an oil change or the likes)
2131 2018-06-26 20:03:30 We need to find the Ighalo's in Judiciary, Health, Politics, Oil and Gas, Education, Security, e.t.c and purge them out of our systems.
2132 2018-06-26 20:03:27 How y’all get off these lash extensions? I’ve tried every kind of oil... really tired walk-in around looking like a crazy person with three long lashes on one eye 
2133 2018-06-26 20:03:24 Cutting #Iran #oil exports "by zero" means removing from the market about 2.8M bbl/d. #OPEC/#NOPEC commitment to raise production will barely compensate involuntary removals of about 850k bbl/d. Fair chance price at the gas station won't be nice to #Trump for #US #Midterms2018.
2134 2018-06-26 20:03:23 New breaks, new tire, oil changed, car wash and a full tank of gas. WUSGOOD.
2135 2018-06-26 20:03:01  my prayers and oil WORKED
2136 2018-06-26 20:02:59 I love how he tweets that opec is raising oil prices with their cut, at a time when they actually started pumping more... He's in for a shock when Iranian oil exists the market completely.
2137 2018-06-26 20:02:55 One of the world's largest oil producing countries and extreme poverty? Total,British Petroleum,Shell,Exxon Mobil,Chevron Philips are the real thieves of Nigeria oils revenues!
2138 2018-06-26 20:02:53 LRT this is just going to tighten supply and hence shoot prices up. And Trump will start complaining of oil prices being too high. This is not good news for countries like Ghana.
2139 2018-06-26 20:02:51 No problem, just give me a shout if you have any other oil painting queries
2140 2018-06-26 20:02:48 @skinnation_ 
My miracle potion & coconut oil sound like pure liquid swishing in their respective tubs when I took them out of the shipping box. This is my first bundle so IDK if they’re supposed to be like that. Please help!
2141 2018-06-26 20:02:39 $GBR 1.36 Entry. Reason: Oil is up huge. GBR is usually one of the first low floaters to get noticed. It has been holding 1.30 very well. ON
2142 2018-06-26 20:02:38 Maybe he could gift trump some art...maybe something bloody...like oil paint with.....an actual bovine heart rotting....
2143 2018-06-26 20:02:32 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
2144 2018-06-26 20:02:12 If you want to radicalize more Iranians and create more tariffs, while spiking the price of oil which will hurt businesses and consumers, then yes, a fantastic idea if you like hurting the American economy and making the world less safe.
2145 2018-06-26 20:02:10 More regulator skepticism about need for #Line3. One commissioner (of 5): "Tar sands, that industry, is probably the most vulnerable of all. If there’s a downturn in the oil industry they’re probably the first ones out the door.” #enbridge
2146 2018-06-26 20:02:03 Oil refineries waste pollute our air, water and land. #Papusha rocket technology is all about recycling refinery waste, that negatively effects the environment.Lets give our contribution in saving environment by supporting this project. #ICO #Crowdsale #Bitcoin #Blockchain #Token
2147 2018-06-26 20:01:59 @RepMaxineWaters you also don’t have a way to tell me you are not a liar.
2148 2018-06-26 20:01:56 Fish Oil 1000mg pills are pretty tough to swallow
2149 2018-06-26 20:01:53 wait for your hair or for oil
2150 2018-06-26 20:01:50 If oil hasn’t done it in the north east! Why the fuck would a third runway, in a fucking London airport??
2151 2018-06-26 20:01:48 You can extract Eucalyptus oil which has many health benefits.. many different types of animals feed off of it's leaves, etc.
2152 2018-06-26 20:01:44 Great insights from @gilbert_makore on FPIC application in indigenous pastoralist communities @WorldBank conference on #gender #oil&#gas and #mining - need to go beyond gender diaggregated participation data to measure meaningful participation.
2153 2018-06-26 20:01:38 Super easy: honey goat milk cleanser, rose witch hazel toner, LUSH celestial moisturizer for winter, make sure the LGBTQIA+ community is getting support year round & not only just in June, glossier sunscreen for outside, & rosehip oil as a night serum. Bam! Healthy glowing skin!
2154 2018-06-26 20:01:15 Wants the price lower but makes a statement that surges oil almost 4% in a day.  Can’t have it both ways
2155 2018-06-26 20:00:43 Indeed, but I'm struck on an almost daily basis by the similarities between what certain US conservatives want and what certain Middle Eastern conservative states have. (Other than "oil", obviously)
2156 2018-06-26 20:00:36 What relationship?  They go together like oil and water.  And I still say Oscar is not his son.  Give him back his memories and then let him work things out with Sam.  That's where the chemistry and the magic is.
2157 2018-06-26 20:00:33 for me i just bought straight up tea tree oil in a tincture and add a few drops in some water to make a spray
2158 2018-06-26 20:00:32 @SophiaTuxford utan facial tanning spray is on offer gal, my tan luxe oil has ran out and cba paying £40 for a new one! go go go
2159 2018-06-26 20:00:31 I feel like it’s an oil
2160 2018-06-26 20:00:31 Its common during the raining season especially places that are infected with termites and soldier ants. Once you drop red oil     on the floor, they will cone in millions.
2161 2018-06-26 20:00:22 Castor oil babe
2162 2018-06-26 20:00:20 bron fans and laker fans really oil and water man, lol
2163 2018-06-26 20:00:06 Hi! We would suggest our 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Baby Rub as well as our 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Baby Wash and Shampoo. We recommend performing a small patch test before use in order to rule out any allergies or irritation.
2164 2018-06-26 20:00:03 Mammets this shit Harley-Davidson said they would jerk shag of their pleasure garden padlock operations in Kansas City to Thailand. That was oil the glove doss house Tariffs were announced. Hence, they were unjust pussy Tariffs/Trade Academy as an charlies. Shows how balanced..

2167 2018-06-26 19:59:56 Fry them abeg. I'll donate groundnut oil.
2168 2018-06-26 19:59:48 難しすぎますが期待はしたいですね
2169 2018-06-26 19:59:42 I agree that we need to help protect orangutan habitat (and that of all the other species living there) but as the research shows, the alternatives to palm oil causes just as much biodiversity loss. Boycotting isn't the solution
2170 2018-06-26 19:59:25 No we don't loool every dish has meat and every time its cooked differently, all you know is oil
2171 2018-06-26 19:59:24 Now The Gov. Is for Sure gonna MAKE sure that An OIL spill WILL Hapen Near A Indian Rezerve, you can Count on that, just CAUSE Indians ARE  MOTHER NATURES ORIGINAL PROTECTORS & Don't want The Pipelines to B.C.Coast. So u watch that's what we Gonna GET for Protecting the Coast SAD
2172 2018-06-26 19:59:15 I am /always/ stained in paints.
Wall paint, art paint and not just water color but pastels and oil paints.
2173 2018-06-26 19:59:08 I think the difficulty in administering it put many off, as was only until 500mg doses was much success seen.
Oil based and deep IM needed, thus poor uptake.
Needs a laparoscopic capsule so can be given as slow release.
Would work a treat in endometriosis as well Breast cancer.
2174 2018-06-26 19:59:05 The McTrumpcake monkeys expects all countries to reduce their iranian oil imports to zero or face MURICA sanctions, a senior state department official said tuesday as oil prices surged.
2175 2018-06-26 19:59:03 We’ve all been told about standard intervals for changing the oil and filters, or for any other maintenance item.
However, a lot of factors can change that interval.
Mark Reddig gets advice from Jerry Sims of Gulf Coast Filters, Inc.
2176 2018-06-26 19:59:03 i watched a video and this girl was like “soak your vagina in olive oil before shaving to avoid irritation” and i was like who has the time for that
2177 2018-06-26 19:58:24 Have to go look at a house for rent and get an oil change. I’ll be on tonight.
2178 2018-06-26 19:58:24 id name it oil so maybe the military would bomb itself
2179 2018-06-26 19:58:21 Inayo ne chutney eyokho, u duru sisi. Eyam-  oil,tomatoes, onion, aromate, sugar

2185 2018-06-26 19:58:02 @SwitchedOnPop episode request: please break down Sophie's "Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides"! there's so much interesting material to talk about with this album!
2186 2018-06-26 19:57:47 The Oil & Gas industry is the common denominator. They could care less about democracy it’s only the price per barrel of oil they see. My next car will be EV!
2187 2018-06-26 19:57:35 右からでした
2188 2018-06-26 19:57:26 Good for you! Very beneficial products from hemp, including the oil, helps with inflammation, and anxiety, and it’s not from the psychotropic part of the plant.
2189 2018-06-26 19:57:25 IF. IF. IF. It's truly SAD though Pres. #OBAMA accomplished a #GREAT deal (jobs cars oil banks) w/o #HELP from repubs. But so much more FAIR progress for the #UNITY of #AMERICA as 1 #PEOPLE, could've been made, considering he was elected twice & STILL hindered by prejudice
2190 2018-06-26 19:57:20 左からの突破効いてましたね～でも勝ったはいいけど決勝Tには大いに不安を残す試合作り・・・
2191 2018-06-26 19:57:20 Another way you can add extra crisp as well as get some oil out is throw them under a grill for a few minutes on high, each side.  
Could also do some veg and bread while you are at it.  
I do something similar to this and it works a treat.
2192 2018-06-26 19:57:09 Let me oil that up!
2193 2018-06-26 19:57:08 And please get it on video for the rest of us 
2194 2018-06-26 19:57:07 Nightmare. 
2195 2018-06-26 19:56:58 I was @ChickiesnPetes South #philly on Saturday for a lunch date with my boyfriend. We ordered the feast and asked for the garlic oil option. The food came drenched in old bay with garlic and oil swimming in the bottom of the bowl.
2196 2018-06-26 19:56:53 .... it’s not that bad with coconut oil and vanilla extract.
2197 2018-06-26 19:56:40 The biggest problem with most vegan dishes from a taste perspective is a lack of fat. The vegan food that actually tastes good have a good amount of fat like olive oil, coconut milk, tahni or peanut butter.
2198 2018-06-26 19:56:18 We'll be sure to let our teams know you'd love to see No Trouble (With Beards And Stubble) come back in the future! What did you love most about our naked beard oil? 
2199 2018-06-26 19:56:18 Tea tree and lavender essential oil... work all the magic today
2200 2018-06-26 19:56:07 Margo discovered fish oil today. She’s obsessed 
2201 2018-06-26 19:56:06 Yes he did, give into Ceaser what is Ceaser's
2202 2018-06-26 19:55:56 Under-qualified? Over-qualified? Location-qualified? Age-qualified? Is that like thousands of lift-truck driver jobs in unheated warehouses in Backwaters USA or maybe working  oil fields of Dakotas sub-zero weather living in tents bc no housing
2203 2018-06-26 19:55:52 I’ve been here for over two hours. Why is this oil change taking forever?!?!
2204 2018-06-26 19:55:46 Nature’s Nourishment from Dischem. The tea trea oil one if you’re breaking out or the Vitamin E one if your face is just really dry. Only R19.
2205 2018-06-26 19:55:42 And... just in case, the SANCTIONS to IRAN may just make it a bit hard to buy oil from them.
2206 2018-06-26 19:55:32 The Saud family is so close to the Bush family that they are in cahoots with our Rep. government. They were behind 9/11 and protected in a hotel by Dubya.  They are behind the Middle East wars, and want all the oil for more riches.  I'm old & remember.
2207 2018-06-26 19:55:29 #ejectorseat maybe an oil slick option or something that scattered tacks.... I could whistle like a cowboy and it would drive up to me?  That would be cool. Built in coffee maker.  

Seriously though.  120V / 15A outlets for power tools would be pretty cool.
2208 2018-06-26 19:55:27 Day 5 of Cohabitating: Tonight Ben is golfing after work and I literally can't wait to have him out of my house so I can clean and organize and coconut oil my hair and watch whatever I want.
2209 2018-06-26 19:55:21 Omg you should see my oil burns now you can proper see where it started dripping aaaa
2210 2018-06-26 19:55:16 I actually put cocoa in my coffee in addition to the cinnamon, unfiltered honey, coconut oil, and a bit of heavy cream
2211 2018-06-26 19:55:08 oil and gas burke forever
2212 2018-06-26 19:55:06 Have you heard of FPSO Oil Rig to Tanker Transfer Jim? Doesnt "Count" towards Scotland's because they have deemed it "unknown" - och it doesnt really matter its only a few billion between friends #UnequalUnion #SmokeAndFuckingMirrors #BigEnoght #RichEnough #SmartEnough
2213 2018-06-26 19:55:02 ah ha ha ha ha Trump lies about EVERYthing.  Even his f*****g presidency.  WHY DO HIS "Lovers" not SEE this?  'Cause they are STOOPUD!!!!  All that oil and gunpowder rots the brain!!   Insane in the membrane....! Duh duh duh da du.....
2214 2018-06-26 19:54:40 technically, melted butter is oil 
2215 2018-06-26 19:54:30 I guess Jesus didn't weigh in on this one?
2216 2018-06-26 19:54:28 Here's a fun thought: america's entering a position to become an even bigger global power than it already is even though we have the ability to tell the rest of the world to go fuck off thanks to shale oil at home
we figured out how to put an autoclicker on reality itself
2217 2018-06-26 19:54:26 Big Corn and Big Oil have seem to find some elusive common ground: both groups are unhappy about today's RVO announcement.
2218 2018-06-26 19:54:23 A cleaver! They were grilled & skinned & dressed in Olive oil, & black pepper! I like 'em chunky! 
2219 2018-06-26 19:54:02 2:54 oil
2220 2018-06-26 19:53:55 You have a one family oligarchical polity. AB's run by a multiple-corporation oil oligarchy. Irving uses open intimidation/fear. Our's uses propaganda to keep 2/3rds convinced the industry has our best interests in mind & thus it has the political power to change our gov'ts.
2221 2018-06-26 19:53:48 Relationship status:
spending my evening trying to work out why the Kubota is leaking oil from the engine block
2222 2018-06-26 19:53:48 Trump pushing to limit Iranian oil before Saudis and Russians can demonstrate their ability to actually deliver barrels (rather than merely state they’ll “aim” to do so) is going to raise risk of spike if Vz slips first up a tad.
2223 2018-06-26 19:53:33 oh yeah if u do use tea tree oil you basically leave it on for like 15 minutes after you shower and then apply moisturizer bc otherwise it can dry your skin up especially if youre sensitive
2224 2018-06-26 19:53:21 You can buy palm oil free versions of all these things. And always tell the manufacturers why you have boycotted their product. We have to try for the sake of orangutans etc.
2225 2018-06-26 19:53:20 It has to do something or something will be done to it. Either stop buying the oil or get the waiver. If it stops, it has to find an alternative supplier. Or some way to sidestep/defy sanctions either individually or collectively.
2226 2018-06-26 19:53:13 Then let the offshore oil drilling begin.  The only prohibited area is Florida.
2227 2018-06-26 19:53:08 Looks like a oil painting, great colours

2229 2018-06-26 19:52:49 it’s sausage, diced potatoes, onions & bell peppers , spices of choice. Coat with 2tbsp olive oil. Cook on cookie sheet (line with non stick foil) 400degress for 45-1 hour. Turning ever 15 minutes
2230 2018-06-26 19:52:48 I have oil painted for a total of two hours in my entire life & it was a diSAstEr but i’m going to give it another shot today! If anyone has any advice or tips, it would be much appreciated bc i have no idea what im doing! :)
2231 2018-06-26 19:52:36 came to elk grove so my baby could get an oil change.
2232 2018-06-26 19:52:02 Oh I've heard Oil is incredible!! Need to read it
2233 2018-06-26 19:51:59 I oil
2234 2018-06-26 19:51:54 It was a slap in America’s face when Trudeau bought Trans Mountain. The is no Asian Intermediate in oil but there certainly is a WTI
2235 2018-06-26 19:51:48 I’m like oil base, I’m hard to lock up
2236 2018-06-26 19:51:48 We definitely do, love! I would try out our Superbalm Scalp Treatment. This soothing ointment of coconut oil and chamomile blue oil calms and moisturizes scalps, while salicylic acid softens dry, flaky buildup for a calm, clear scalp! 
2237 2018-06-26 19:51:26 Went back to using the Paul Mitchell tea tree oil system and my hair has changed dramatically for the better
2238 2018-06-26 19:51:21 Hoje eu vi o célebre oil man pedalando DE ROUPA, COMPLETAMENTE VESTIDO. Os tempos mudaram mesmo
2239 2018-06-26 19:51:16 LMAO start mixin that shit in our coconut oil
2240 2018-06-26 19:51:16 Nahhhhh that aunty needs to come through with her anointing oil for this match plssssss
2241 2018-06-26 19:51:12 I heart coconut oil but don’t use it as much as I used do for some reason.
2242 2018-06-26 19:51:05 Why are we giving hard-earned American dollars to Venezuela and Brazil - and yet cutting Food Stamps for American children????? Venezuela has State oil company owned by Russia- where is a link for more information? @UNHumanRights @ACLU @NILC

2244 2018-06-26 19:50:54 Need to get the olive oil out of my hair before Saturday
2245 2018-06-26 19:50:48 Couple of coats of oil based Zinsser and then one coat of Matt emulsion
2246 2018-06-26 19:50:45 Today I’m getting the oil changed for my dad in the fam car. I’m walking around Walmart waiting & realize I don’t have the keys. I start to freak tf out & start retracing my steps & start to call my dad but then I remember THEY HAVE THE KEYS SO THEY CAN CHANGE THE OIL.
2247 2018-06-26 19:50:23 Good lord. All that needs to happen is to insert "Oil" in the middle of the name, and then we'll have something accurate!
2248 2018-06-26 19:50:17 I'd like to live in a world where oil change places are judgment-free zones. #iknowimoverdue #cantaffordtofixtherest
2249 2018-06-26 19:50:12 He was there when he was needed? 
Needed for what?
On the day he really was needed he failed. 
Fact he lost his wife lends credibility to claims he pursued girls to fulfill his needs.
2250 2018-06-26 19:49:55 Is @RSPOtweets certified “sustainable” palm oil truly sustainable? If you think #deforestation is sustainable then yes. #EURT2018
2251 2018-06-26 19:49:55 Saudi is were we get our oil from. But we don't it we have enough here. I agree withyou
2252 2018-06-26 19:49:54 $GBR getting volume here into the close, with oil back up near all time highs, basically a no brainer for a spike move sometime soon.
2253 2018-06-26 19:49:53 California isn't all liberals, it just contains THE HOLLYWOOD LEFT. Set Hollywood adrift on a couple of old oil tankers, Kevin Costner could be King!
2254 2018-06-26 19:49:51 Me @ Alba products: YOUR OIL CONTROL MOISTURIZER IS SO GOOD BUT ITS SOO SMALL PLEASE MAKE A BIGGER TUBE!!! 
2255 2018-06-26 19:49:49  I'm not a fan of our current waste oil system. This looks awesome.
2256 2018-06-26 19:49:34 Biko it's to late. Keep ur anointing oil biko
2257 2018-06-26 19:49:23 What Drama Marcos Rojo Argentina gets the goal, this has to be the best World Cup I’ve ever seen . Brilliant just brilliant #Russia2018 #WorldCup
2258 2018-06-26 19:49:19 Megan it is a sentient oil spill with toothpick teeth!! Lol
2259 2018-06-26 19:49:16 yeah usually breakouts especially on the upper body are caused by fungus so anything with tea tree oil in it would help bc its a fungicide so ppl will use shit like head & shoulders shampoo (which has tea tree oil for dandruff) to clear their chest and bacne
2260 2018-06-26 19:49:07 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
2261 2018-06-26 19:49:02 Yes they do. But u can't get all ur steel & aluminum or products from overseas. If they want to raise prices like they did before with oil u just have to take it.Or charge 295%  tax on our farm products like Canada. oh well. Tariffs will be temporary.
2262 2018-06-26 19:48:54 Argan oil, castor oil, shea butter and olive oil
2263 2018-06-26 19:48:47 You got me on the oil change?
2264 2018-06-26 19:48:40 That CBD oil has been making me sleep like a baby and I have insomnia so it’s crazy how much that shit helps
2265 2018-06-26 19:48:27 America's oil and gas industry is raising concerns over President Trump's Tariffs.  Cost increases for imported and domestic steel will raise consumer prices.   Thank You republicans #MAGA
2266 2018-06-26 19:48:18 If I watch the oil pickup truck I'm try to make it with a seam technology I did not complete anyting I do not care how many people build pickup truck the oil garbage the concept is 100 time better technology handicap accessible possibility I solved the problem Sidereal optional
2267 2018-06-26 19:48:11 Yooo I’ve been wanting to bring back oil cup so bad lol
2268 2018-06-26 19:48:01 High gas prices suck for most of America, as for me I’m in the oil and gas business, and love to see those prices rise. It kickstarts the jobs here in Texas, and really gets the economy going. However that isn’t Trump making prices high. Research OPEC
2269 2018-06-26 19:47:53 ive gone 2-3 days with one but peppermint oil and lavender/chamomile tea really help!
2270 2018-06-26 19:47:49 4th deadliest highway in BC. Increased traffic due to Oil and Gas Industry. For some reason all the oil and gas revenue goes to the lower mainland for their infrastructure,why is that? There is no reason that the Alaska Highway cannot look like the highway in GP Alberta
2271 2018-06-26 19:47:35 If I am to be a light to others, then even in my darkest hour, may I be graced with the oil that fuels my lamp.

2272 2018-06-26 19:47:35 Dem no dey get better oil for head
2273 2018-06-26 19:47:33 Which part of his wonderful leadership do you like;
-Screwing up the India trip royal
-getting into the oil business by buying a pipe line
-molesting a women in BC
-taking away jobs from Canadians with signing TPP
-taking away jobs with his Globalization proj. using cheap labour
2274 2018-06-26 19:47:24 Federal judge dismissed lawsuits by San Francisco and Oakland against oil and gas companies.  

Judge says the impacts are a worldwide issue and the benefits of fossil fuels are worldwide too. 

Basically the judge agreed we need a global approach which is good advice to Canada
2275 2018-06-26 19:47:09 Exfoliate them!
- Use a lip scrub or you can make your own (DIY)

- Ingredients:
   - sugar (1tbs) 
   - coconut oil (a little bit)
   - and honey (1tp)
- Mix them and that’s it!

2280 2018-06-26 19:46:51 I relax my hair every 2 to 3 months 

I apply coconut oil and black castor oil about 3 times a week. 

I don't wash my hair that much coz it's usually braided
2281 2018-06-26 19:46:45 bespoke: when you’re putting sun dried tomatoes in quiche and then u cook the baby arugula with a drizzle of the tomato oil
2282 2018-06-26 19:46:25 I wash my face with cetaphil then use witch hazel rose petal toner and moisturize after that with a mixture of raw Shea butter, vitamin e and coconut oil. Works well for me
2283 2018-06-26 19:46:21 We tried to tell them. They believed the snake oil salesman who said BELIEVE ME only I can fix it. That's when ppl with brains RUN..for the truth
2284 2018-06-26 19:46:21 Thank you! I’ve been using coconut oil on the calluses. I’ll have to get the mushers salve before winter I hadn’t heard of it.
2285 2018-06-26 19:46:18 Ok I’d sort of consider a lemon + olive oil Zucchini bread a “Kuchen” even though it’s not very “German.” For a classic American “cake,” my favorite recipe is the Barefoot Contessa’s chocolate cake recipe — it replaces all other liquids with coffee! Delicious.
2286 2018-06-26 19:46:13 black soap is just good for your skin in general and it treats bacterial acne and tea tree oil treats fungal acne
2287 2018-06-26 19:46:05 I'm horrified to say I used to be like that as a teen. Cover myself in coconut oil, lie in the sun for hours, then whinge when I was burnt to a crisp and got heat-stroke 
2288 2018-06-26 19:46:02 Too generic

Put baby oil for extra burning
2289 2018-06-26 19:46:01 my grandma saw me using my juul the other day n i told her it was an essential oil pen
2290 2018-06-26 19:45:56 My granny wanted to oil my scalp so I let her
2291 2018-06-26 19:45:48 We need more justices who will uphold the Constitution, free speech, 2nd Amendment and all.
2292 2018-06-26 19:45:27 Just listened to the @BGStanleyBros podcast on CBD oil Charlottes Web & also talking with @realmofcaring So interesting & hugely informative! Loved every second! A must!! #toppodcast
2293 2018-06-26 19:45:19 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2294 2018-06-26 19:45:19 It was not pretty!!  But I applied some oil, so it’ll stop hurting in a few minutes
2295 2018-06-26 19:45:16 america is about to steal my nose, it's pure oil right now
2296 2018-06-26 19:45:04 Remember amf built Harleys. All the parts were stamped made in Japan bikers hated it. They leaked oil.
2297 2018-06-26 19:45:04 Ooooohhhh. For a minute I just thought he misspelled coming....
2298 2018-06-26 19:44:57 CBD oil and for the rest of my life, 

I’ve always read nothing but positive things and now It’s locally in stores,
2299 2018-06-26 19:44:42 Real orange oil, so counts towards your 5 a day.
2300 2018-06-26 19:44:40 I learned that the hard way  threw tanning oil over mine and everything tanned except those lmao
2301 2018-06-26 19:44:20 #Breaking
#US asks nations to stop importing #Iran oil by Nov 4,  or face sanctions, including #China and #India (i24news)
2302 2018-06-26 19:44:18 Will the Texas Commercial Shrimping Industry get shut out once again??? Do you know our shrimp is the most valuable in the U.S.? Did you know ALL gulf states received millions to promote their seafood after oil spill - Texas - $ZERO.
2303 2018-06-26 19:44:15 Days I’ve been here: 4 
Crab cakes eaten: 5
Number of restaurants we’ve had to walk out of due to peanut oil: too many
2304 2018-06-26 19:44:14 basically any really big brand like equate is shit tier the one i use is called Nubian Heritage but tbh theres probably better ones if you really look

also african black soap + tea tree oil is really good for any body acne or just breakouts in general
2305 2018-06-26 19:44:14 If you like a lot of olive oil on your rye, join our club!
2306 2018-06-26 19:44:10 Fund raisers for multi million dollar private jets, limos, mansions.... Is this stuff Jesus needs? The least these hucksters could do is throw in a bottle of snake oil.
2307 2018-06-26 19:44:10 Oh Lordy Lord Mr Wolf. Nothing happens on time in this oiley world. It is all patience. We have waited this long, what is a bit longer.
Just chill.
2308 2018-06-26 19:44:08 Agree. Even more disturbing is the supposedly the oil companies acknowledge global warming exists, and is caused by fossil fuel. In light of many, many recent publications and reports, this is more inndoubt that ever before.
2309 2018-06-26 19:43:54 Carrot seed oil
2310 2018-06-26 19:43:47 But in oil transfers to others brings big returns
2311 2018-06-26 19:43:47 I gotta get an oil change
2312 2018-06-26 19:43:41 Could be an oil if it has a dropper. A greenish oil like hempseed or one with spirulina/kale.
2313 2018-06-26 19:43:01 I've been giving my dog CBD oil for his anxiety. It's not working. It's making things worse. Now he's super paranoid in *addition* to his breathtaking anxiety. Barks at EVERYTHING real or imaginary. Ugh.
2314 2018-06-26 19:42:57 i have such a love/hate relationship with aquariuses - we either click instantly or we’re oil and water lol

No, it's Oil Can Boyd
John Kruk?
I got it, it's Ken Griffey, Sr.
2318 2018-06-26 19:42:35 also, if you use that face wash without including toner and some sort of face oil... your skin will drryyyy up. it’s aggressive.
2319 2018-06-26 19:42:28 This castor oil has started ise kise. My belle don dey turn again 
2320 2018-06-26 19:42:21 If you're a stone crop fan (and haven't already!) we highly recommend double cleansing with the Stone Crop Cleansing Oil and Stone Crop Gel Wash  Gets rid of every trace of makeup and is so hydrating!
2321 2018-06-26 19:42:20 $CL_F makes a new high today as expected and now showing 5 waves up from 63.62 low #Oil #Elliottwave
2322 2018-06-26 19:42:08 You can bash Tesla. Def has some shining vulnerabilities. But the alternatives at least domestically are automakers who for decades pushed out talented forward thinkers and clung to their connections with oil. No pity parties.
2323 2018-06-26 19:42:06 * U.S. pushes allies to stop imports of Iranian oil 
    * Libyan uncertainty supports Brent
    * Canada outage supports U.S. crude prices
    * Escalating trade disputes threaten growth

2325 2018-06-26 19:41:51 If they were concerned about national security they would impose a ban on Saudi Arabia where 15 of the 19 9/11 terrorists were from and who routinely sponsors terrorism. But they won’t. Because Oil. Somalia doesn’t have Trump resorts and massive oil fields.
2326 2018-06-26 19:41:43 Low prices - partially linked to tmx and energy east failure no? A multi year sustained decrease in foreign investment while the price of oil has gained steadily since this government gained power.
2327 2018-06-26 19:41:40 This weekend the #GOP are going to pour used automobile oil (real & synthetic) into the water ways to flex the muscle of the #EPA.

2329 2018-06-26 19:41:24 I don't know why I get so anxious about getting an oil change. It's like I'm afraid I'm going to decapitate the dude in the pit when I leave.
2330 2018-06-26 19:41:13 Actually there is a big German bank that already said would transact. But I doubt there is an Oil company in EU, that doesn't do business with US. And as said, that was when companies were to be sanctioned, not the country.
Are there Chinese reactions yet?
2331 2018-06-26 19:40:59 — Don’t use oil before you go to sleep ( use a moisturizer instead) 
— Take off makeup before you go to bed ( your skin will become oily & your acne will multiply) 
— Stop using expired makeup & dirty brushes. 
— Go to a dermatologist for any acne prescription.
2332 2018-06-26 19:40:51 Oil is what it's all about - wait & see after Putin & Trump meet. Sanctions lifted ya think?

2334 2018-06-26 19:40:37 In the last two days I've read two AMAZING plays that deal wonderfully with the passage of time and the cost of progress. "Cannibals" by Rory Mullarkey and "Oil" by Ella Hickson. Genuinely epic plays that take big risks while always retaining a sense of simplicity/intimacy.

2348 2018-06-26 19:39:39 I voted yes on 788 all because I want to get off of percocet (Oxycodone) that I've been on for 15 years. I'm taking CBD oil but it's too expensive for a guy on disability. I have seizures, paralysis on my right side but can walk. I hate taking percocet, muscle relaxers, & Keppra!

2355 2018-06-26 19:38:54 i’m literally watching the game while waiting at the car shop for an oil change and i’m trying so hard not to laugh out loud
2356 2018-06-26 19:38:46 Devolved powers? This has nothing to do way English laws as Heathrow was. 38% yes 64% didn't unlike England we have a choice. You think when your RICH partner is thinking of leaving and taking there Oil Gas fishery away with them AND you don't want that you think they would vote
2357 2018-06-26 19:38:28 I’ve got tanning oil in my fucking eye
2358 2018-06-26 19:38:13 Why does a oil change take this long
2359 2018-06-26 19:38:09 Sounds like the oil will be kosher.
2360 2018-06-26 19:38:06 Half that bottle of oil on the table is GONEThat can't have been just for the bat!
2361 2018-06-26 19:37:59 I have a new and profound love for olive oil

2363 2018-06-26 19:37:58 ALSO, invest in some beard oil and/or beard butter (butter is better for shorter facial hair) it eases irritation
2364 2018-06-26 19:37:56 True. I tried to find crackers in my local tesco without palm oil.. found only 1.. the tesco branded one..
2365 2018-06-26 19:37:54 Yep, oil too. Saudi Arabia should be on the list. When you sell your car and only ride a bicycle, we can talk.
2366 2018-06-26 19:37:36 Batter it and throw it in hot oil

(and as for the fish...)
2367 2018-06-26 19:37:34 Thank you! CBD oil has been miracle medicine for my dog who suffers from seizures and nerve pain. No other medicine has come close to helping her. She’s like a puppy again!
2368 2018-06-26 19:37:34 I can't remember a time previously when @RosieBarton or her CBC National predecessors routinely called out Exxon, Kinder Morgan, or other corrupt oil giants for their predatory delay on #climatechange, & it's the same sort of 'civility' seen in their coverage of #CPCracists.
2369 2018-06-26 19:37:33 he's taking us to war. it's about oil, which only war can keep in power
2370 2018-06-26 19:37:23 He isn't retarded, he's a snake oil salesman.
2371 2018-06-26 19:37:19 Add to that The Shopping Channel is full of snake oil sales people. The most recent thing I saw was a "lymph node roller" to roll away the toxins. People who sell such things should be in jail.
2372 2018-06-26 19:37:16 I hate coming to get my oil changed shit takes forever
2373 2018-06-26 19:37:14 also apparently ACV + tea tree oil is supposed to be a really good combination for keeping your skin clear but ACV smells bad so
2374 2018-06-26 19:37:12 My day - took a 9am speedboat to the mainland to make a 10:40 bus connection, boat almost runs aground & as we are nearing the dock at 10:20 apparently like runs out of oil and can't steer? We manage to make it to the doc, then I take a motorcycle taxi to the bus station...
2375 2018-06-26 19:36:57 When there is not enough lavender oil to calm your nerves... These prosecutors worked too many of my nerves today. 
2376 2018-06-26 19:36:56 Acne/Dark Spots: 

— Deep cleanse (Noxzema is a good product for deep cleaning & getting rid of oil underneath skin) 
— Keep your skin hydrated (wash your face morning, afternoon & at night) 
— Tone your skin
— Lightly exfoliate (black soap is good for this)
2377 2018-06-26 19:36:56 The fact that absolutely no fondation works on me. It just sits weirdly on my face with dry patches and oil
2378 2018-06-26 19:36:55 He doesn't want lower gasoline prices.
He's tweeting the tweet so when oil gets 100+ he will be on record for wanting lower ;-)
2379 2018-06-26 19:36:52 遅まきながら、車体右に倒しちゃえばoil抜かずに交換できるんですよ。
2380 2018-06-26 19:36:34 Ok our bad assumption that your reference to an oil company likely = petroleum-related pollutants. We remediate hydrocarbons in situ every day. 
But obviously we don't know the site & it's details & our archaea don't metabolize cement.
You want to fix it, or just express outrage?

2382 2018-06-26 19:36:11 Castor Oil is the new bae 
2383 2018-06-26 19:36:02 All the more reason for conservatives to turn out in November 2018 and 2020
2384 2018-06-26 19:35:55 Why are you doing oil commercials?
2385 2018-06-26 19:35:53 Ok, but equally the £1bn asked for for CCS might be a waste of cash, the right conditions for lagoons appear to me much less around the world than wind, solar; these things are project based (like oil) rather than modular like wind, solar so less scope for rapid cost reduction...
2386 2018-06-26 19:35:52 I AM NEVER AGAIN PUTTING SUN TAN OIL ON MY LEGS
2387 2018-06-26 19:35:42 Hi friends, who can fix and oil leak and won’t charge me A billion dollars
2388 2018-06-26 19:35:39 From the time Rex Tillerson stepped up with the oil deal it was over. Hope everyone has a current passport cause at this point ya gotta know when to get out
2389 2018-06-26 19:35:35 @nafnafgrill If your Baba Ghanoush is made of Eggplant, tahini, garlic, salt, olive oil and lemon juice. Where do the 15g of carbs come from in a 142g serving?
2390 2018-06-26 19:35:23 WTH i haven’t seen it but I’d be careful peppermint oil is very ... tingly and STRONG
2391 2018-06-26 19:35:22 He means Snake Oil.
2392 2018-06-26 19:35:17 Take the oil?
2393 2018-06-26 19:35:15 Seems I am reacting to this clarins oil
2394 2018-06-26 19:35:08 Tomara que largem a porta aberta toda vez q alguem sair seu quarto.
2395 2018-06-26 19:35:04 Naija I must receive oil for this high adrenaline rush you are giving me!!!
2396 2018-06-26 19:34:44 Priscilla salute him, anointing oil, and they shall be written in Kadesh, a moment in the dead, they that travelleth; and
2397 2018-06-26 19:34:43 We don't want to win. Let's just draw. Nigeria! Do it for the mercury. The oil cartels. A draw. Is it to much to ask?  #NGAARG
2398 2018-06-26 19:34:35 On a positive note though after my hour long sports massage I’m covered in coconut oil and I smell delicious 
2399 2018-06-26 19:34:21 Not if you. Are aligned with Trump and also the Russian oil stock.
2400 2018-06-26 19:34:15 Agora sim fico ruim
2401 2018-06-26 19:34:14 The United States has told countries to cut all imports of Iranian oil from November and is unlikely to offer any exemptions, a senior State Department official said on Tuesday as the Trump administration ramps up pressure on allies to cut off fun...
2402 2018-06-26 19:34:12 Ever since I brought home some CBD oil my parents question everything I bring home including some amazingly delicious brownies lmao.
2403 2018-06-26 19:34:12 They're weren't as burnt as they look, cooked in the same oil as the steak
2404 2018-06-26 19:34:07 Oil changes be making your car feel like a car and not a go cart
2405 2018-06-26 19:33:44 Argan oil is my fave #VACAYVoxBox #Contest
2406 2018-06-26 19:33:44 If I had real map making skills I would make a map showing oil relationships between countries and it would blow the minds of the geopol centric people
2407 2018-06-26 19:33:38 Having a car is fun until you have to pay for gas every week and repairs and oil changes and insurance and inspections and wiper fluid and wipers and tires and ect
2408 2018-06-26 19:33:30 I mean using olive oil to tan quicker probably wasn’t the best idea I’ve ever had 
2409 2018-06-26 19:33:28 The United States has told countries to cut all imports of Iranian oil from November and is unlikely to offer any exemptions, a senior State Department official said on Tuesday as the Trump administration ramps up pressure on allies to cut off fun...
2410 2018-06-26 19:33:20 Of course we’d first and foremost recommend keeping those curls hydrated from within with help from hydrating shampoo, conditioners, and regularly masking! We’d also recommend using a cream or oil depending on your porosity to keep those curls defined!  #junecurlboxchat
2411 2018-06-26 19:33:20 Oil cup & porkchop
2412 2018-06-26 19:33:11 Didn’t you check the oil?
2413 2018-06-26 19:33:08 That’s true and I am very sorry she has to deal with this with every waking moment. But that’s doesn’t make it any less harsh. I mean what about when Obama cut all businesses dealing with oil and coal.
2414 2018-06-26 19:33:06 Oh my mistake, I thought dead Americans were more important that oil deals between politicians. 9/11 training grounds in SA continue as the population hates USA. Same can be said for Pakistan. Indonesia is worse, they are uncontrollable even by their own govt.
2415 2018-06-26 19:32:58 My phone offends me whenever it wouldn’t recognize my finger print. Like wtf bruh this is me with just a little oil from my Potato Corner fries damn. Tiwala naman.
2416 2018-06-26 19:32:53 That looks like oil
2417 2018-06-26 19:32:28 @BlairDunlop1 right mate I have tried to get a hold of you for weeks now. You have obviously changed your phone number or blocked me. The boiler you fitted is leaking oil and this is the only way I can get to you. Can you get back to me as soon as possible instead of ignoring me
2418 2018-06-26 19:32:28 Oil spike ahead. This is reminiscent of the time in The Big Short when default rates on NINJA mortgages contained within CDO’s hit 20% but financial institutions carried on regardless. Vz and Iranian production loss will not be balanced by Russia & Saudis. Spike will come.
2419 2018-06-26 19:32:26 did you used to be a milkman Dave? You talk about milk like I talk about tea !
2420 2018-06-26 19:32:15 Forrester: It's seen him!

Pastor Dr. Matthew Collins: Thou anointest my head with oil. My cup runneth over. And I will dwell in the house of the Lord, forever.

[Martians kill Uncle Matthew]

Sylvia: [scream]

Col. Ralph Heffner: Let'm have it!
2421 2018-06-26 19:32:11 That your Tom Oud oil perfume don hol am down
2422 2018-06-26 19:32:08 oh my god why can't beauty brands just label moisturisers normal things like 'moisturiser for dry skin' and 'moisturiser for oily skin' rather than fucking 'INTENSE MOISTURE BOMB MASK OIL ROSE GOLD SHIMMER CREAM' like DUDE WHAT AM I BUYING
2423 2018-06-26 19:32:03 Never use palm oil.. or products with palm oil...
Thats what Ive done for decades.....
2424 2018-06-26 19:31:53 Not what he@meant. The Saudies are allowed in because they control oil. Doesn’t that tell you something?
2425 2018-06-26 19:31:51 my mom and i are watching the game while eating ice cream and putting coconut oil in each other’s hair we’re living our best life
2426 2018-06-26 19:31:43 This is a funny one just a tease your oil lovers out there air cannon upright Muffler it work like a e-cigarette vaporizer to create fake smoke this is cigarette Muffler applied to the Roadster the Falcon one which I name or the Phoenix X 
2427 2018-06-26 19:31:32 Nymex Settles 6/26/18 - CL Aug18: 70.53 (+2.45) (+8.7% vs Last Week) #nymex #wti #oil
2428 2018-06-26 19:31:25 I’ve had straight THC oil, with no terpenes or other cannabinoids, and it isn’t nearly as good a medicine as whole plant extracts to me either. 
2429 2018-06-26 19:31:17 Excellent article. But I'm not sure trust it's a magic bullet. Look at Norway: afaik there are no societies with higher trust levels than ours. Still, we extract oil like there's no tomorrow.
2430 2018-06-26 19:31:14 If you massage it into your scalp it’s supposed to stimulate hair growth! But I think it’s too thick to put on my whole head of hair so that’s why I use coconut oil for the rest!
2431 2018-06-26 19:31:13 Fragrance of gas and oil smells like money.  Gold diggers love it
2432 2018-06-26 19:31:10 "can I oil you up?" as a opener is lowkey fire
2433 2018-06-26 19:31:02 She wants to be so much like her mom
2434 2018-06-26 19:30:51 I am spending my time on nb politics and federal. If conservatives get back in we will be fighting fracking again here. Their leader worked for Irving oil so its like letting the fox run the hen house.
2435 2018-06-26 19:30:49 my car drives so much better after an oil change 
2436 2018-06-26 19:30:43 The passion in the kitchen starts from the heart. Exalt your recipes with the special flavor of HENRI MOR’s olive oil
2437 2018-06-26 19:30:40 Pretty sure purgatory looks like the waiting room of an auto shop where you're eternally forced to watch Cake Boss reruns while waiting for an oil change.
2438 2018-06-26 19:30:39 Cheers added - crazy few days on oil - good do with some rationality - don't they know its school holidays FFS
2439 2018-06-26 19:30:37 Started off in the mail room at imperial oil in Edmonton
2440 2018-06-26 19:30:25 The message itself is backed by no facts , personally I'd rather plain english than a lying snake oil salesman like obama. Leave the country if you don't like it . We refuse to have a country lead by idiotic liberals who do not love this country
2441 2018-06-26 19:30:15 Scrap the digestives. They contain palm oil and I havenae sacrificed a bairn fae breakfast time!
2442 2018-06-26 19:30:08 i’m so happy we moved on from using coconut oil, whoever told you that occlusive comedogenic oil was good for your face doesn’t want to see you winning
2443 2018-06-26 19:29:59 always laughed at the "white people use flour as a spice" meme but not anymore since it is now my reality as i am living with my grandparents from my moms side and ooo shit they dont even have olive oil how do these people LIVE?!?!?!?!
2444 2018-06-26 19:29:40 The oil institute was moved by gaddafi from Benghazi the birth place , we will not be ruled by Tripoli we have been saying this since 2013 !
2445 2018-06-26 19:29:33 Come on Nigeria hold on, always loved oil me and green stuff
2446 2018-06-26 19:29:20 Went to get my oil changed and turns out my fuel line has a leak  so adding to the oil change plus an additional back headlight that’s out, there goes $400 just like that

2449 2018-06-26 19:29:09 i would also consider starting to take omega 3 capsules..very good for the skin...if you arent allergic to fish oil

2451 2018-06-26 19:29:06 It’s called hypocrite, or sell out.  Or liar, because it’s about OIL.
2452 2018-06-26 19:29:06 I think rural India eats rice, wheat, vegetables, oil more than bread and biscuits. All unpackaged.

But I get your point on progressive taxation.
2453 2018-06-26 19:29:06 I don’t wear makeup to the pool so stop asking what highlight I use , my skin is flawless no scars, no bumps , no oil so stop asking me what foundation I use because it’s not the foundation sis .
2454 2018-06-26 19:29:05 This is even funnier because it's at "Jiffy lube" oops haha sorry but oil is slippery  @JaredLeto @ShannonLeto hahaha
2455 2018-06-26 19:28:52 Jiffy Lube really be tryna finesse. All I wanted was a oil change and they tryna sell me everything in the shop. I know my car is beat up but a oil change will due buddy.
2456 2018-06-26 19:28:48 Sounds like you might to decide to stay even after the oil change is done.  lol
2457 2018-06-26 19:28:43 Here’s my plan to boost the profits of big oil at the altar.
2458 2018-06-26 19:28:36 ALSO!! Used a lip scrub [brown sugar and argan oil shh] and hydrating balm for the first time in awhile last night and things are just great. You can do really simple things to take care of yourself and that's coming from a lazy hoe like me. It's worth it.
2459 2018-06-26 19:28:31 I took it in for an oil change because my matience light was on and so much stuff ended up being wrong w it that it’s gonna cost $700 so I’m just gonna go get a new one w my grad money. 
2460 2018-06-26 19:28:06 thats an oil name I suspect
2461 2018-06-26 19:27:59 Oil field/construction men are hot!
2462 2018-06-26 19:27:30 What you people think I'm trailer Park.
My Dad worked in the oil field as the bossman .
So yeah growing up I lived in a few trailer parks .
I lived in houses on farms in town on edge town on lake resorts country club high society as well
2463 2018-06-26 19:27:08 Shea butter and coconut oil will have your skin glowing to the gods. I promise you.
2464 2018-06-26 19:27:07 Finest whale oil 
2465 2018-06-26 19:27:05 I've never really tried using anything except oil paint and pen digitally. I dispise using charcoal IRL.

Africa's Best Organics Hair Mayonnaise (deep condition)

2467 2018-06-26 19:26:57 Surely some of these Nigerian footballers could have helped get the unclaimed £20 million oil inheritance out of the country whilst on their trip to Russia - not sure why Nigerian bank managers keep emailing me to ask me to do it.
2468 2018-06-26 19:26:56 i went and got an inspection and oil change by myself today... i’m officially growing up
2469 2018-06-26 19:26:50 i’m getting my oil changed rn and they keep coming and asking me if i want them to fix my windshield wiper/air filter/get my tires rotated. like damn just change my oil that’s all i want
2470 2018-06-26 19:26:48 (3/4) But some are trying to discredit #NatGas, citing fugitive methane emissions. At #BP, we are tackling this problem and working with industry partners in the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (@OGCInews). #WGC2018
2471 2018-06-26 19:26:41 @LidiaBastianich I never knew Italian sausages could taste so wonderful on their own until I followed your advice: rub with olive oil, baked for 20 minutes. Best advice ever.  
2472 2018-06-26 19:26:35 What an awesome!!!  Idea!! ...@KremlinRussia_E yo!....please.... We have oil field also... We Bruv!...help a fellow oligarch!
2473 2018-06-26 19:26:24 I just put a shit ton of coconut oil in my hair and I feel so gross 
2474 2018-06-26 19:26:23 You got 5 dollars? You said you tryin buy some oil?
2475 2018-06-26 19:26:21 Current hobbies include:
-Exhaling but never inhaling 
-Peeing on the every mailbox to assert my dominance 
-Eating nails (without any milk)
-Drinking milk (without any nails)
-And drinking crude oil whenever the hell I want
2476 2018-06-26 19:26:18 @FIFAWorldCup quit obvious Cakir is being paid by Nigerian oil dollars. Penalty what a laughter
2477 2018-06-26 19:25:54 Елси API бычий (а он скорее всего такой) то думаю завтра уже ближе к 71 будем перед ЗАПАСАМИ и что то мне подсказывает, что продаж не будет.

2478 2018-06-26 19:25:54 smoking that oil pen is so fucking bad for you.
2479 2018-06-26 19:25:52 Do not grasp the enormity of who it is really offering a free oil change at pep boys.
2480 2018-06-26 19:25:50 Nigga spilled da "smell bottle" & da oil man said "ohhh ohh yea. You gone buy dat"
2481 2018-06-26 19:25:15 Coconut oil and prayers tbh
2482 2018-06-26 19:24:46 Of course this has been true since St Ronald was peddling the snake oil, but glad to know you've come around.
2483 2018-06-26 19:24:43 Snake oil has multiple applications
2484 2018-06-26 19:24:33 I’d put my money on the sun and solar energy. What a source of power! I hope we don’t have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that
2485 2018-06-26 19:24:33 Alfred did you get the oil change im over my 3,000
2486 2018-06-26 19:24:25 Is labor exploitation truly sustainable @RSPOtweets? No? Then why certify it? Close the loophole now #EURT2018 palm oil is not a good thing. Boycott it.
2487 2018-06-26 19:24:14 Ohh yes argan oil i love..its so good for the hairs..leaves them smooth and shiny

2488 2018-06-26 19:24:05 In our Heal & Hydrate line, we of course start with aloe juice, but we also include ingredients such as creamy shea butter, rich coconut oil, and luxurious macadamia oil in these hydrating blends. #junecurlboxchat
2489 2018-06-26 19:24:04 Why do we need to see a carnival barker, snake oil salesman going off on an hour long rant of pure nonsense.
2490 2018-06-26 19:23:56 Sunbeds were made by gods cos fake tan is rank nothing better than jumping on for 15 mins each day with some fruity body oil and seeing yourself tannnnn
2491 2018-06-26 19:23:54 Transition to lower carbon economy? Oil use continues to expand, in fact our federal gov. (Remember them) just purchased a pipeline, is that an investment we can be proud of? Or was it a waste of money that the tax payer will be on the hook for? SMH
2492 2018-06-26 19:23:48 I can see many governments getting nervous about potential oil price rise!
2493 2018-06-26 19:23:46 Felt in debted to them for fighting for the oil that our govt feels we deserve!!
2494 2018-06-26 19:23:42 I have 4 scars. 2 are knife wounds (on both arms) from protecting two women on separate occasions from abusive niggas. The 3rd one above my eyebrow, I tripped and fell while drunk. Oh, and I have a 2nd degree burn on my right hand from cooking oil/fire

2498 2018-06-26 19:23:22 I have epilepsy and totally agree that the cannabis oil should be legalised for those that truly need it. Unfortunately there is some people who have epilepsy but do not have an extreme amount of seizures think they should use cannabis! The reason why who knows!!
2499 2018-06-26 19:23:22 I sighed reading the headline
2500 2018-06-26 19:23:05 What the sign really said: "Homestead Lamp Oil"; What I thought that it said, at first: "Homestead Llama Oil". #LOL
2501 2018-06-26 19:23:05 Argan oil is seriously amazing! #evawashandprime #VACAYVoxBox #contest
2502 2018-06-26 19:23:03 You know you are more likely to die from a lightning strike, then die from a terrorist attack.  Also, we should definitely learn from 9/11, we destroyed so much land over there by taking so much oil. The US said they would help more, but we have left a lot of people stranded.
2503 2018-06-26 19:23:03 I had 3 cats that mysteriously all had kidney issues like Spoon at a new house I moved to... turned out to be some Essential Oil/Potpourri Tart Burners that were put in a position where the cats would attempt to lick it.

1 of them survived... hopefully Spoon does too.
2504 2018-06-26 19:23:03 I hate that Nissan always trying to finess me for my free oil changes . Like it’s in my contract 
2505 2018-06-26 19:22:57 Hey — you may want to refer back to your pinned tweet. The only legal CBD oil here is hemp based, not cannabis based. Ask anyone who suffers from seizures and they’ll tell you the difference between the two plants and their efficacy in treating symptoms.

2509 2018-06-26 19:22:34 Don’t worry rigs will keep coming online sooner than later. So all of y’all oil workers could get more hours or better offers from another company...
2510 2018-06-26 19:22:30 Imported food. The price of fuel continues to rise, having recently hit the highest levels seen in three and a half years.. Iran is the third biggest oil producing country and retaliating against trump imposing sanctions and breaking a deal.

2528 2018-06-26 19:20:45 US equity markets were calmer in the absence of trade war headlines, the S&P500 up 0.5%. The US dollar is also firmer, and oil prices are higher, while US interest rates were fairly stable.
2529 2018-06-26 19:20:28 Am i the only one who hates the texture of oil?
2530 2018-06-26 19:20:21 Victoria Oil and Gas partners with Naturelgaz in compressed natural gas project
2531 2018-06-26 19:20:02 The other parties of the Iran deal try to keep it alive. That means having to buy oil+gas from Iran. Wow, quite a power play. Trump's been trying to bully the Eu into buying US oil & gas for a while. Also China put tariffs on US energy.

2535 2018-06-26 19:19:17 I can't help but picture that in a somber cyberpunk voiceover while a camera pans over a neon city on a river with burning oil fields in the background. "Cocaine pollutes the rivers, and the eels are out of controls."
2536 2018-06-26 19:19:10 Is this a proxy for small vs large cap US oil equities?

2542 2018-06-26 19:18:12 Don't forget him asking in holyrood where the money for an oil fund was going to come from with no clue as to why the place erupted in laughter..
2543 2018-06-26 19:17:43 If only Iraq had one of the largest oil reservoirs in the world to rebuild their own country!?
2544 2018-06-26 19:17:38 So difficult to understand. Much higher oil prices will be very harmful to GDP growth.
2545 2018-06-26 19:17:34 Thank you Lizzie!!! Hope all is great on the Island  xxx
2546 2018-06-26 19:17:17 @JoeNBC I don't think you get to include the 57k dead service personnel in the "incivility deaths" # unless you also include the dead Vietnamese, including civilians. And if that's the case you need to include the unnecessary never ending GWB Oil War deaths in the current # .
2547 2018-06-26 19:17:14 Thx
2548 2018-06-26 19:17:04 I harass oil traders over speculation, does that count?
2549 2018-06-26 19:17:02 Chef Ramses cut up some worms, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was his first born child, along with cheese.
2550 2018-06-26 19:16:53 I moved to Alberta from one of those “have not” provinces because I wanted to support my family through my job and not rely on government assistance. Remember, those are the same provinces that protest fracking and pipelines all while living off imported oil. 
2551 2018-06-26 19:16:53 I can tell that the Aunties back in Nigeria they busy with they anointing oil on the tv screens #FIFA2018
2552 2018-06-26 19:16:46 •Sugar

Why it's bad: produces excess oil
How to fix it: Eat less man-made sugar (natural sugars that are in fruit & things are okay)
2553 2018-06-26 19:16:39 I really want to eat that. X
2554 2018-06-26 19:16:30 If it makes you feel better, my coconut oil is still older than my relationship and I’m married

2562 2018-06-26 19:16:00 Tell the oil traders to knock it off. It's costing me more at the pump.
2563 2018-06-26 19:15:52 - Exfoliate before exposing your skin to the sun. 
- Use a tanning accelerator.
- Begin with a high SPF. 
- Move up to tanning oil with SPF after you have a base tan. 
- Apply a tan extender each night after sun exposure to keep your tan longer.

2566 2018-06-26 19:15:38 Just loss of Empire and all the remaining major colonies, boom/bust, lower growth than rest of Europe, progressive deindustrialisation, the oil crisis, incipient racism & relative isolation in Europe.

Brexit is basically back to square one, but as a vastly diminished country.

2574 2018-06-26 19:14:58 All of you commenting negatively about the latest gas tax — think about how little it increases the price of gas in CA compared to the enormous rise from oil companies over the last year. The tax raised it a few cents/gal, but oil corps raise it every f-ing week!
2575 2018-06-26 19:14:57 Hemp oil is the only think that works for my COPD. 1000's of dollars of medicine did nothing

2579 2018-06-26 19:14:42 use a oil based cleaner like dish soap to remove as much makeup then wash then
2580 2018-06-26 19:14:37 Sounding like you tryna start your car with no oil
2581 2018-06-26 19:14:29 Nigeria overtaking India as the country with the highest number of poor people (86million) is to be considered even a feat for an oil producing country with the most marketable crude oil strains in the world...
2582 2018-06-26 19:14:27 Pizza bread, olive oil, Oregano, gratin cheese. Try it and you'll unlock the door to heaven.
2583 2018-06-26 19:14:24 Just want a relationship that outlasts the jar of coconut oil in my kitchen cabinet
2584 2018-06-26 19:14:15 Hey Justin surfer to surfer the GOP is going to pollute our oceans with oil and chemicals don't you care about that?
2585 2018-06-26 19:14:11 Hit the gym at 5:30 this morning and have been eating since

2586 2018-06-26 19:14:11 And then he whispered, if you had oil or something else we valued,
you could take as many liberties with our borders as you like.
2587 2018-06-26 19:13:55 It's like the people who's job is to mist/oil dudes up for shirtless scenes or whatever like where do I volunteer?! I'll do it for free!
2588 2018-06-26 19:13:53 This supposed Iran crude embargo totally contradicts from Trump's push for  lower oil prices (asking OPEC for volume increase)?

How do you reconcile both above actions?
2589 2018-06-26 19:13:52 Boss I deh hail..  Abeg make your oil touch me small nah
2590 2018-06-26 19:13:50 "The nastiest and grooviest things in the world cannot be cuddled or even ingested - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
2591 2018-06-26 19:13:47 Subsidizing oil companies for liability and telling them to fix what they broke is not what we are talking about. I agree with that for one thing - they are responsible for their actions. I'm talking about affirmative action, healthcare, Medicare etc. social programs.
2592 2018-06-26 19:13:42 Good ill take 3 i need something to check my oil and clean grease off my hands
2593 2018-06-26 19:13:41 Not likely...the cost of shipment to Europe will make oil from the Golf more expensive...Right now Iranian oil comes through a pipeline to the Mediterranean...the gulf to Suez to med adds a lot of miles and unnecessary fuel to moving the oil
2594 2018-06-26 19:13:19 Within the corporation there are assets in progress (or under construction) which will not usually begin amortization until the asset is put to use. 

Once the oil flows the amortization begins.  But so do the revenues.

2599 2018-06-26 19:12:47 So are you shorting oil or waiting for maybe another signal?

2605 2018-06-26 19:12:17 *huffs tea tree oil*
2606 2018-06-26 19:12:07 Why is it important to read labels? I was about to buy a jar of giardiniera. It's a blend of vegetables, spices, and omega 3-rich olive oil, so it should be #healthy, right? The particular brand I picked was blended with inflammatory soybean oil instead of olive oil. Close call.

It has replaced paper and thus
2610 2018-06-26 19:11:51 How can I finesse getting my car an oil change and cleaned out while having to be at work until 10pm? 
2611 2018-06-26 19:11:47 Because they're our oil supply despite being the #1 supplier of jihadists to Syria, our government doesn't care
2612 2018-06-26 19:11:39 XLE/OIL now screaming that this oil move is a stop run.
2613 2018-06-26 19:11:39 Physical therapy today was amazing! A few days ago I started CBD oil hoping it might help with my legs. I haven't used the cane in 3 days, I wasn't super unbalanced during PT, and I was able to walk to my mailbox! #CBD #cbdoil #physicaltherapy #health #exercise #medicalmystery
2614 2018-06-26 19:11:32 Liberals  

They let themselves be lead by snake oil salesmen.

They’re blind to their own hypocrisy.

Oh well, 35k sealed indictments and hundreds of resignations across government and business.

The rats are abandoning ship. Hussein’s staff is turning on him.

Winning!
2615 2018-06-26 19:11:20 Oil traitors back at it again. Oil above $70 over rumor, doubts and uncertainty which has nothing to do with supply & demand. #jailtheoiltraders
2616 2018-06-26 19:11:12 Soooo I was on some crazy acne medication but I can tell you that using a gentle cleanser two times a day (I use neutrogena ultra gentle) and exfoliating 3 times a week (always in the mornings) and I use st.

2625 2018-06-26 19:10:22 Hey! Winter hair is a struggle but for me using thick creams and products has helped. The @CantuAfrica Leave in conditioner is heaven sent especially when I use it together with their tea tree and jojoba hair and scalp oil. The trick is to go thick in winter.
2626 2018-06-26 19:10:05 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。
2627 2018-06-26 19:09:59 But China will never bow...............US are delusional.
And Russia has for now a huge excedent due to high price since the beginning of this year. They can cut their own production easily to maintain oil price
2628 2018-06-26 19:09:45 You need to blend honey, acv, avocado, olive oil, lemon and milk. Keep in you hair overnight. It’ll change your life.
2629 2018-06-26 19:09:43 I guess no more travel threw Canada to Alaska to teriff on usa travel threw Canada and fire arms that travel Canada to usa Alaska us the boat trump and are oil go get your own then we will pipe it to bc coast and ship it to others country's that will fix trump problem or truck it
2630 2018-06-26 19:09:30 There was a lot of oil & salt in that pita pocket I had for lunch.
2631 2018-06-26 19:09:28 But the cat, "you've never poured oil on their hinges; there is a single thread to bang, but she gave me so she spoke imploringly
2632 2018-06-26 19:09:20 If your shoes are able to be washed I would recommend doing that. You could have walked through it at some point and have the oil all over the shoes.
2633 2018-06-26 19:09:10 We are on a slippery slope greased with oil! We are picking up speed at an alarming rate! We all know how this will end! Republicans the party in power are stoking the flames towards it! Remember America is " white man's country"! The fear of it getting darker is scaring them!
2634 2018-06-26 19:09:09 Get plenty of maintenance rest and drink lots of water, or should I say oil?
2635 2018-06-26 19:09:07 okay honestly tru and tbh moisturizing is kinda fun dhsjksk but also u can blot off oil but u cant blot off dry patches on ur foundation 
2636 2018-06-26 19:08:47 @Guymowbray called Messi the manager, @jjenas8 said that pushing someone by the throat isn't a foul. @CliveTyldesley made jokes about Stalin, Putin, and oil, @MTLawrenson being and incorrect as ever. How poor and unprofessional are these commentators? #NGAARG #WorldCup

2638 2018-06-26 19:08:27 Hey @VinnieTortorich do you have any experience with egg fasting? Basically you eat about 4-6 eggs with either 2 tbl butter ,coconut oil, mayo and 4oz of cheese for a week to kick in to ketosis, good or bad?
2639 2018-06-26 19:08:26 I so hate cheap olive oil
2640 2018-06-26 19:08:24 Dictators, nuclear weapons and oil! Students have understanding of generic reasons that US instrumentalises to justify its wars.
2641 2018-06-26 19:08:23 Steel pipes and tubes used in drilling and transporting crude oil flooded into Canada this spring, a Reuters analysis shows, as U.S. President Donald Trump's steel tariffs forced producers from Asia to Europe to seek new markets.

2643 2018-06-26 19:08:00 So where does the oil go when you wash the pan? Is it only preseasoned for the first time you use it?
2644 2018-06-26 19:07:53 If acuyfers are finishin we must preserveted water.the way is put over the seas all the oil.
2645 2018-06-26 19:07:43 0.2% Extra Virgin Olive Oil. 0.2%!
2646 2018-06-26 19:07:33 Which are you asking? Is it sarcasm or a great product? If you are basing on wealth would you call Shell Oil a great company?
2647 2018-06-26 19:07:30 You know it’s hot when your coconut oil turns into actual oil
2648 2018-06-26 19:07:30 What's a hatchback or crossover you like? Oil prices sprung back up to $70/barrel today off of administrative shenanigans, and the RAM 1500's duties will be fulfilled prolly by Winter. Would be nice to downsize with a lease trade-in somewhere.

2650 2018-06-26 19:07:15 Most amazing is that Republicans whose life's mission (after tax cuts for the rich) is to protect the sanctity of business, who bristled at the slightest hint of govt criticism (remember a TX Repub who apologized to BP for negative govt action for it Gulf oil disaster), are mute.
2651 2018-06-26 19:07:07 Lmao I chop a clove up and make sure it fills a table spoon. Then I fill the spoon w olive oil and salt. Swallow it all. Again you’re Welcome
2652 2018-06-26 19:07:06 Oil & gas are doubly dirty and such powerful emissions (methane 20 times worse than CO2) are not counted in the consuming country, but should be part of the anslysis
2653 2018-06-26 19:07:03 This needs to be reported on a much larger scale than it is for it to have any impact. I've only recently looked into palm oil and I'm horrified on how much it used. Companies who DON'T use it, should promote it (they are missing a trick)
2654 2018-06-26 19:07:03 America chose oil & voodoo economics over conservation & stability when it elected Reagan. Republican mantra: This place sucks. Democrat mantra: Mind your manners! Punch left! Hug Bush. Champion Kissinger. Kissinger + Clinton = Republicans. SCOTUS disappoints? Dems were there 1st
2655 2018-06-26 19:06:41 So you just gonna come out the house without puttin some oil on ya feet? Heels lookin deadly out here ik these streets...  that's crazy.

2658 2018-06-26 19:05:53 Taos County receives vital education funding from the oil and natural gas industry! 
2659 2018-06-26 19:05:48 My sister tries to make eggs:

-fails to turn on the stove for 5 mins
-adds water to the pan
-lets the oil sit, sizzle, and burn her
-forgets to whisk her scrambled eggs
-breaks a small plate in the bowl she stirs the eggs in

yup
2660 2018-06-26 19:05:46 I would but the oil in my beard me making my screen mad greasy after the call.
2661 2018-06-26 19:05:45 lol cuz of the coconut oil?
2662 2018-06-26 19:05:31 It's 2018 and men still think that women should do all the housework and cook daily... Oh btw we still have to work full time as well. And their asses can't even change my oil themselves. Gtfoh. 
2663 2018-06-26 19:05:29 More like Dallas without the oil; but maybe that’s coming later in the season!
2664 2018-06-26 19:05:25 Never knew there was such a thing as ‘beard oil’ ... every days a school day 
2665 2018-06-26 19:05:01 Oh & yesterday I installed my new window motor in my car & also replaced the outside door handle too all by myself with 1 hand...lol Took me all day but I did it. Still got to change the oil & air filters. Might replace the transmission fuild too but it's expensive...lol
2666 2018-06-26 19:04:57 Why does all your fleet of boats use diesel oil for propulsion & on-board power generation?

#GreenHypocrisy
2667 2018-06-26 19:04:51 Destructive to the environment.... just recently they stripped legislation that was put in place to protect against oil disasters in the ocean like the Deepwater Horizon leak, withdrew from the Paris Accords on climate change, put an oil CEO in charge of the EPA
2668 2018-06-26 19:04:50 You should check out the AeroPress. Better than French press if you just want a cup.
2669 2018-06-26 19:04:43 Somebody say the way he dey fall fall for the pitch top, he fit discover oil.
2670 2018-06-26 19:04:36 ID, ability to speak English, they ask where you came from, where you are going. Generally a series of innocuous questions that must knit together reasonably
2671 2018-06-26 19:04:35 Which oil
2672 2018-06-26 19:04:35 Idaho. I had ~17 yrs in the field. Wanted to stay near kids. I had 1 good offer in the region but that was oil work in the Basin. 3 months later the bottom dropped out of oil so I was glad I didn’t take that one.
2673 2018-06-26 19:04:27 @SirDavidBBC Have you thought of/would you consider,making a documentary series that highlights the plight of animals, people, landscape due to palm oil production? If companies could be bombarded with consumers demanding it's replaced in their products, maybe they'd take action?
2674 2018-06-26 19:04:26 Foods that are good for you and inexpensive: pinto beans, collard greens cooked with olive oil and herbs no pork, baked chicken with no skin, sautéed mushrooms, spinach, kale, Swiss chard, salad, beets, a few suggestions. And stir fry veggies with red and green peppers
2675 2018-06-26 19:04:25 I tell you, Sudan’s NCP government is so shameless! What more need would be there for them to ‘secure the oil firlds’ If the outcome of Kiir-Riek summit is a political compromise and peace? They couldn’t resist the desire to somehow connect SS peace to oil!
2676 2018-06-26 19:04:19 Steel pipes and tubes used in drilling and transporting crude oil flooded into Canada this spring, a Reuters analysis shows, as U.S. President Donald Trump's steel tariffs forced producers from Asia to Europe to seek new markets.

2678 2018-06-26 19:03:50 US oil companies and manufacturers help create a climate that allows a corrupt regime to terrorize the people, line his own pockets and destroy everything. Kinda like don the con.
2679 2018-06-26 19:03:49 President Trump is now lecturing our allies that they should not buy oil from Iran or they will face sanctions.

Can you imagine if someone lectured President Trump to not be friendly with Vladimir Putin or Rodrigo Duterte?
2680 2018-06-26 19:03:47 My truck:

2) an actual ton of dog hair
3) empty oil canisters. but where did the oil go?
4) 5,000 coffee cups. same Q.
5) that Feb. community council agenda I am saving for some reason 
2681 2018-06-26 19:03:37 To you being a good steward of the land is giving into big gas, oil, & coal to drill & mine on our farm land, ranch land, federal land, Parks &rivers! FULL STOP!
YOU are hiking behind paid events, hand picked crowds, & big donor events. 
Please, you're only good to yourself!
2682 2018-06-26 19:03:16 y’all my mom really just said “your oil change shouldn’t be more than $30” girllll do you not know what car i have  that’s not even half of the price lmao
2683 2018-06-26 19:03:15 $4 million? I’d pass at that number. I’m cautiously optimistic the Oil can have a good summer and improve the team with value deals because of some of the names on the market now. Will they? Who knows, but I feel there is a path for them to take now.
2684 2018-06-26 19:03:14 Investment fleeing in droves. Well documented. Go block Canadian resources as usual and maybe try a taste of that Saudi Wahhabi oil you love so much. We know your game. Better call that snap election, Canadians are waking up to your traitorous lies.
2685 2018-06-26 19:03:12 Yeah more like a few mini pizzas haha! I cut it into rounds, drizzle with a wee bit of oil, bake for 20 mins to soften it, flip the slices over and top with cut-up tomatoes, cheese on top, then scatter some garlic powder over and pop back in the oven till it's all melty & golden!
2686 2018-06-26 19:03:12 @potus what's up with the price of oil.  Middle class getting hammered with the rising cost.
2687 2018-06-26 19:03:08 Good! No need to apologize, these are crazy times. What is party pt? If you don't mind me asking. I know (or think I know) that oil is state owned, and therefore the cost for is low and and the profits are kept for the people?
2688 2018-06-26 19:03:00 Hello, we sincerely apologize that you were given a vehicle that needs an oil change. Please note that you have the option to exchange the vehicle for another vehicle in the same car class at the nearest Avis location. Please let us know if we can further assist you. ~Susan
2689 2018-06-26 19:02:57 It’s too hot to have a proper tea-

Whatever you do, don't hydrate the burn with coconut oil or any equivalent. 
2700 2018-06-26 19:01:52 Mina I mix it with Rose water and coconut oil
2701 2018-06-26 19:01:41 I’ll go out on a limb here, but in a word...oil
2702 2018-06-26 19:01:36 I’m seriously so thankful for Jacob. He bought new tires for my car, fixed my air and changed my oil, thx babe
2703 2018-06-26 19:01:28 My Audi has been in for several times due to oil leaks and all sorts of problems. It's not even 55km.... Maybe Audi standards have really dropped. Sad indeed!

2706 2018-06-26 19:00:49 Started our geriatric family dog on CBD oil today. My Dad keeps asking me if I've "given the dog her weed yet?".
2707 2018-06-26 19:00:40 I report every ad I get from an oil and gas front group. It is like throwing pebbles at a freight train, but that’s basically what David vs. Goliath was so I feel good about it.

2709 2018-06-26 19:00:33 You can apply them with coconut oil to soften them. They are probably pressure calluses. There is also a mushers salve that you can apply to there feet in the winter to save from ice. It can also be applied to calluses.

2714 2018-06-26 19:00:11 Rich in oil.inhumane towards the poor and take no responsibility,what a disgrace.
2715 2018-06-26 19:00:07 I hope they give CBD oil all the praise it deserves.
2716 2018-06-26 19:00:06 @1Romans58 That hideous "art" was hard to look at. I hope you don't mind that I countered it with two of my positive oil paintings of the President. Unfortunately, the gross cartoon is still stuck in my brain. Will need to ask Reddit if Bleachbit scrubs human memory...

2721 2018-06-26 18:59:23 Thanks for reaching out! Our Artisan Café products don't contain palm oil as an ingredient.
2722 2018-06-26 18:59:22 So Jadran takes over #OilCrescent, says oil is for GNA’s NOC, immediately @FrankBakerFCO calls him a terrorist. #Haftar bombs #Libya for 4 yrs, kills 000s, removes elected officials, takes over OilCrescent, says oil is for unrecognized Eastern govt, Frank Baker keeps shtum.

2727 2018-06-26 18:58:59 Bottom line is no...just eat real food!  Safflower oil on a polyunsaturated fat that can be refined, bleached and even deodorized and is considered a bad fat, along with other vegetable oils like canola, cottonseed, hydrogenated oils, etc.  Thanks for coming to NO as a bottomline
2728 2018-06-26 18:58:53 Hahahaha it is always sooo frizzy, this was right after I put product in it, so within the hour it was bad  I use Marc Anthony strictly curls products and argan oil finish spray in an attempt to get me through the day

2752 2018-06-26 18:55:31 I feel you on this. I was the same way, and then I stopped using so many matte products. There are all these things trying to dry you out, so your skin just produces more oil bc it thinks it’s not getting enough... Now, I’ll do just like a matte primer and powder. Or matte
2753 2018-06-26 18:55:22 Half of my bumper is currently being held up by the string off of acowboy hat.

2771 2018-06-26 18:52:51 Exactly what I keep saying. As long as these issues keep being politicized, which creates an us vs. them mentality, it makes it easy to see the issues and actions as indiscriminate when in fact they are highly personal. Civilized behavior is the oil of a civilized society. mtm
2772 2018-06-26 18:52:47 A recipe mixes 1/4 cup of oil with 3/4 cup of milk. What common food could you add too keep the oil and milk emulsified? #Nutrition #finals
2773 2018-06-26 18:52:36 & fact of the matter: 

Even IF it was true (that we helped the Middle East for oil) which it’s NOT, that still pales in comparison to what your country has done.

Who are YOU to criticize? 

The Nazis were so bad Germany has NO right to criticize anyone. 

Except Russia maybe.

2780 2018-06-26 18:51:48 I guess I'm very skeptical of snake oil businesspeople selling preexisting concepts under a new buzzword

it's like saying "synergy didn't exist until the 1980s" or "return on investment didn't exist until the 60s" or "user acquisition didn't exist until the mid 2000s"
2781 2018-06-26 18:51:48 So at this point in history, with tribalism and Islamic culture in particular not sufficiently integrating into developed economies—why should said economies welcome indefinite, mass immigration of Muslims?   

Why not wait until cultures mature so that it won't be oil and water?
2782 2018-06-26 18:51:44 Having COWS is why they are this powerful.

What if they had CRUDE OIL?
2783 2018-06-26 18:51:34 Manager needs to apply anointing oil on Iheanacho
2784 2018-06-26 18:51:30 could be a stranded asset in 10-15 yrs prolonging oil extraction  for the sake of a pipeline.
2785 2018-06-26 18:51:29 I had only Peanut oil so took a pass :)
2786 2018-06-26 18:51:26 This women is trying to mix oil  with water, that man is only drinking it.

2788 2018-06-26 18:51:01 Maybe Canada should stop send electricity, oil, natural gas etc to the USA or double the price
2789 2018-06-26 18:51:00 Finally got some answers on my car.  PTU is leaking tranny oil from the intermediate shaft.  English translation - that'll be a grand kind sir.  

I could fix it myself, but my time right now is worth more than that (unfortunately for me).  All for (roughly) an $18 seal kit.
2790 2018-06-26 18:50:44 I’m literally obsessed with skin care. Facial masks
Hydrating serums

2791 2018-06-26 18:50:35 @PurpulHair oil hun
2792 2018-06-26 18:50:34 Dollar is up, gold is down but oil is way up.  I would have thought oil and gold would move together.
2793 2018-06-26 18:50:32 Definatly going to try that. Was gonna go down to Lucas oil and see if they were selling tickets too but i dont trust half the people who sell
2794 2018-06-26 18:50:30 How correct is the assessment doing rounds that crude oil price will come down to $30-40 per barrel after Saudi's oil giant Aramco has successful IPO? Any views on this point folks?
2795 2018-06-26 18:50:20 I’m afraid of the oil. 
2796 2018-06-26 18:50:19 FDA approves first marijuana-based epilepsy drug: CBD oil...
2797 2018-06-26 18:50:17 I also learned how to check the oil, brake fluid, wiper fluid, fuses and battery and also tire pressure.  I always pictured cars as these huge death machines we made on accident but they're actually kind of simple
2798 2018-06-26 18:50:11 Tea tree oil
2799 2018-06-26 18:50:02 This is Jeremy's meal ticket.  He seems obtuse to the fact that we've picked up on that.  Can't wait for him to write a new book- will use it to catch oil spills in the parking lot.
2800 2018-06-26 18:49:46 thats going to be a long trail of oil someone has to clean up

2802 2018-06-26 18:49:20 Tax Cuts have helped everyone dumb ass! & hes actually not done shit to public lands! Oil & Gas companies are gonna drill wherever the fuck they want whether we like it or not! Im in Burleson TX & there was like 10 rigs fracking around my home at a point in time! Which I get paid
2803 2018-06-26 18:49:17 The they struck down the war on oil!! They are blazing!!!

2805 2018-06-26 18:49:08 オイルだって怒るんだぞ怒ったら引火してギトギトのボーボーにしてやるからな
2806 2018-06-26 18:48:57 Considering how many of our grandfathers DIED fighting Nazis (and then humanely and kindly saved Berlin from Soviets) we have EVERY right to shame Germans who dishonor those sacrifices with dumb claims like “You steal oil!” - If that were true we’d have invaded Canada. 
2807 2018-06-26 18:48:56 For some reason my sensitive oily acne-prone skin is not bothered by coconut oil. But standing within a few feet of silicones means a cystic acne breakout. I wish we could leave them all out.
2808 2018-06-26 18:48:45 Where's my anointing oil? Enough is enough
2809 2018-06-26 18:48:37 Usa also want a friendly dog who submissing iran to israel, usa and saudi takfir arabia. And naturally want iranian oil like in 1953 with the cia coup against mossadeq. Simply, want a colonization of iran
2810 2018-06-26 18:48:33 And don’t forget opening up Pristine Wilderness for Big oil and Gas.
2811 2018-06-26 18:48:22 does rosehip oil help with scars? Would it help to clear my acne scars and mosquito bites scars?
2812 2018-06-26 18:48:12 @SeibenLore is the one with the Phyrexian oil problem, not me. I am just a free agent doing the Grand Cenobite's bidding. All will be one.
2813 2018-06-26 18:48:10 @AlbertaatNoon Quebec recently proposed legislation to limit oil and gas exploration. The argument they don’t have the ability to raise revenue is incorrect they REFUSE to raise revenue. Alberta has to do the dirty work????
2814 2018-06-26 18:48:09 Love your work. Your likeness of Valbo is stunning. I miss working in oil. It’s an expensive hobby... acrylic & watercolor supplies are more my price range 
2815 2018-06-26 18:48:04 Good question . 
Closest answer is because build up money out of innocent lives in Yemen . Wars are manufacured nowadays , weapons are just daily consumption. People lives are just oil
2816 2018-06-26 18:48:03 So very true.
2817 2018-06-26 18:48:02 logically
Demand is increasing
While supply cut since 2014 is well maintained by Opec
as Now US saction on Iran iran a big oil exporter to Ind and China
as now US try to zero import of Iran oil
now what
all other oil demand incresing price is rising.
2818 2018-06-26 18:47:28 Wow.......atleast Pakistani foods dip in cooking oil would have some healthy effect
2819 2018-06-26 18:47:25 My skin hates coconut oil, especially anything of the "leave it on to never sink in your skin" variety. No doubt in my mind my skin would scream if I tried this. Acne for months!
2820 2018-06-26 18:47:15 Flint

2827 2018-06-26 18:46:32 Oil prices are criminally high.
2828 2018-06-26 18:46:31 Why is coconut oil unhealthy? Never heard that one before
2829 2018-06-26 18:46:25 Hair Talk 

Products like gels, leave-in conditioners, etc. works much better on damp hair. Deep conditioners and coconut oil works best on freshly washed hair
2830 2018-06-26 18:46:13 my sister sprayed me in carrot oil too, tho she has caught a tan and I haven't  just not made for this weather
2831 2018-06-26 18:46:03 I've rode my Shadow to death. Still keeps going. Change the oil and change the tired.

2837 2018-06-26 18:45:35 Wall Street, Big Pharma, Big Oil, Silicon Valley all supported Hillary Clinton in the election.  The only sector to back Trump was Prisons. And now this.
2838 2018-06-26 18:45:29 Brazil has oil and resources for us to exploit. So I'm sure it's "everyone's" best interest if go down there during their current political crisis and choose a leader for them to elect. Maybe a soft coup in Brazil first followed by brutal takeover of Venezuela. Ugg I feel sick.
2839 2018-06-26 18:45:16 kinda a agree mike, but there only using the electric motor to prevent any turbo lag  not for environmental reasons, i don't like hybrids, because the oil companies
get a piece of the pie. , i hope porsche does more electric cars and Jag as well.

2843 2018-06-26 18:45:07 Sometimes editing a video is like oil painting; you put down a first layer and it still doesn't like really look like anything (and invariably it's 10 minutes long). Then you put down another layer, and another. Eventually it's done and doesn't look a thing like the 1st attempt.

Can not sleep 
1  eat a banana 
2 put some drops of lavender oil on your pillow 
3 drink a cup of calamine tea
Cheaper than pills and potions
2845 2018-06-26 18:44:50 The distribution of wealth as ever seems so unfair
And thousands grow poorer for every new millionaire
Oil tycoons and arms dealers make millions every day
Whilst thousands are dying of hunger like flowers in decay.
2846 2018-06-26 18:44:29 
2847 2018-06-26 18:44:22 Again... what work? DeVos can barely find her ass with both hands and a flashlight, Carson is just a joke and is doing nothing to further the actual purpose of HUD and Zinke’s pretty much handing everything over to oil and coal companies. So again what work?
2848 2018-06-26 18:44:16 Do y’all still use Lusters Pink oil on y’all weave since it ain’t all natural ?
2849 2018-06-26 18:44:11 #Indonesia is the global leader in #deforestation, the reason is the world’s thirst for #palmoil. Palm oil is the most widely used vegetable oil on the planet. It can be found in over half of all packaged products at the supermarket, incl everything from cooking oil to lipstick
2850 2018-06-26 18:44:02 The model of prostitution to the oil companies through their owning our citizens and elected leaders is not a good model.

2853 2018-06-26 18:44:00 It will have to apply so won't be automatic. England needs the oil revenue so they will be nasty though we could employ the EU to negotiate on our behalf.
2854 2018-06-26 18:43:55 @lecreuset I just purchased a set of your beautiful oil and vinegar cruets from one of your outlet stores, to find that once opening the package both of them are labeled “vinegar,” and I no longer have access to the store to exchange.
2855 2018-06-26 18:43:45 A device that releases banana peels and or oil slicks behind the truck. Also turtle shell launchers (one for red shells one for green shells). Also the ability to summon lightning that shrinks the cars around me.

2857 2018-06-26 18:43:28 CLNE a monster -now up to $3.96. Will stall as it approaches $5.00-cut off for fund being able to buy a stock. By July-Oct 2019 min price tgt $15. Max price tgt $45-$50 if oil approaches all time high which is a good possibility.
2858 2018-06-26 18:43:28 Before answering, think... why do we throw hot oil?
2859 2018-06-26 18:43:08 And thank you for helping me deal with my victim mentality. Taking money from oil companies would make it harder to put them out of business.
2860 2018-06-26 18:43:04 It's all just Voodoo Accounting anyways 

Its the socialization of the oil industry that Trudeau is trying to destroy 

Remarkable story
2861 2018-06-26 18:42:58 Are US citizens also banned to travel to those countries? How about travelling for medical reasons? And what if a huge oil reservoir found there?
2862 2018-06-26 18:42:57 It’s hard for me to see the good. There’s some, for sure. But he’s so proud to do away with regulations like those that protect our water supply so oil and gas companies can make more money and get away with polluting our shared and necessary resources. It’s hard to stand by.
2863 2018-06-26 18:42:54 I be havin to change my oil it feel like every week 
2864 2018-06-26 18:42:50 Gotta get an oil change before this trip in 2 weeks  because I plan to take my own vehicle..
2865 2018-06-26 18:42:50 Supply & Demand.  It’s actually pretty simple. Apply what OPEC does with oil production.
2866 2018-06-26 18:42:44 Hello, Canada? 

Please do the world, especially the United States, a HUGE favor and stop sending us your tar sands oil.
2867 2018-06-26 18:42:39 Ottawa.  I'm referring to a technical, economy wide recession. I believe Canada narrowly avoided one in 2015 when oil prices tanked. After that you have to go back to the global economic crisis.

2869 2018-06-26 18:42:22 They drilled “exploratory bore holes” all along in front of our houses to see if historical oil contamination had flowed underground down the hill from the West’s site. They came back a couple of times and seemed to sample them for gas. No word on results (to me, at least).
2870 2018-06-26 18:42:09 All the stolen oil under his pillow.
2871 2018-06-26 18:42:03 @realDonaldTrump Want to build a wall to secure the border? Add Mexico to the US. Belize and Guatemala, too? Look at the size of that border instead. Think of the assets! Solves: immig. crisis, cartels, imports/taxes/manufacturing, oil/OPEC. All with the money saved on wall.
2872 2018-06-26 18:41:37 I disagree with 1,2. Dey are d highest owners of oil assets. N anambra lacks access to port facilities.

2874 2018-06-26 18:41:08 But - where's the money for an oil fund going to come from (Laughter in the Chamber). Looks round glaikitly..

2906 2018-06-26 18:38:54 I like both those things separately, and on an homemade pizza I can accept anything. On the proper italian pizza, I'm a bit of a dick. Tomato sauce, mozzarella, EVO oil, and basil. Stop, that's all* you need.

2921 2018-06-26 18:36:50 It’ll be dry. You do t have to use olive oil, but you’ll be chewing dry meat without it.

2923 2018-06-26 18:36:31 This is the news I’m seeing today:
-SCOTUS upholds Muslim Ban
-SCOTUS strikes down California law on Anti-Abortion centers
-Fed judge dismisses climate change lawsuits against big oil
-20 mining claims have been staked on land Trump cut from monument protection

2924 2018-06-26 18:36:00 Conveniently fails to identify the large new office space that came on the market during the period .... people made big investments expect8ng $100 oil forever are now blaming a government for their lack of planning and risk management.

2926 2018-06-26 18:35:52 First Irak then Libia läter Syria and Jemen and now Iran. Too many weaponsand interests of some mighty nations make the middle East kaputt. More pain and families wandering looking for peace. Oil is too cheap ? Let's close the borders of a country to makebusinessunder somepretext
2927 2018-06-26 18:35:51 With the way Nigeria is going down, they will soon discover more oil
2928 2018-06-26 18:35:50 a small drop of cooking oil should do the trick!
2929 2018-06-26 18:35:49 Have you checked the oil?
2930 2018-06-26 18:35:39 aaaaand a whole lotta oil
2931 2018-06-26 18:35:35 Parico kosco is the worst gas and oil company I have ever done business with so Happy I left them
2932 2018-06-26 18:35:19 What's your take on this oil move? Double top?
2933 2018-06-26 18:35:18 Gas and oil
2934 2018-06-26 18:35:14 Yes not only cause of oil and money but cause they are partners in killing Yemeni people , so when yemenies respond once a while it is a threat while daily crimes by Saudi US collation has become just daily routine. This is how their intelligence has become .
2935 2018-06-26 18:35:12 wait no, indica is a body high, it’s more for relaxation, sativa is a head high, i gives you a oil boost
2936 2018-06-26 18:34:56 I’m such an adult I got an oil change by myself today
2937 2018-06-26 18:34:45 No, never ruin good food.  But a bit of goofer dust on her seat would be a plus.  Some triple hexing oil on the door handle....
2938 2018-06-26 18:34:31 i get just white bread with oil and vinegar on it.
2939 2018-06-26 18:34:31 thank you mollie  my mom said she brought home a virus so im gonna go out and get some lemons and hope for the best lol. you use the oil diffusers too right??
2940 2018-06-26 18:34:29 But oil is from plants and that's vegan. Also carnivores eat meat. Mostly I'm an omnivore.

2948 2018-06-26 18:33:58 @AlbertaatNoon For the love of God separation again… How about we require anyone invoking separation explain how a sovereign Alberta would  move it’s oil to tidewater more profitably? The US is screwing us now, how wouldn’t it be worse without the leverage of Canada behind us?
2949 2018-06-26 18:33:56 Unlike you, I remember 1973. We were called 'The sick man of Europe'. Sterling had lost value and unemployment was rising. There was industrial unrest and an oil crisis. Companies could only operate for 3 days a week. and there were frequent power cuts. It wasn't that great.
2950 2018-06-26 18:33:53 Put an import tariff on all foreign oil until domestic production equals domestic demand at a minimum.  Export surplus fuels to anywhere in the world.  Move ahead with LNG before it’s too late.  Stimulate the economy to increase funds available to pay income taxes.  No carbon tax
2951 2018-06-26 18:33:37 Trying CBD oil for the first time because I can’t deal. Any tips? Lol 
2952 2018-06-26 18:33:37 TGIN - honey miracle mask,
Shea Moisture - manuka honey & mafura oil are my fav moisture masks rn. Using their strength & restore mask is good for protein, using aphogee’s 2 min reconstructor once every 6 wks as last resort, only if you experience severe damage (which you won’t)

2962 2018-06-26 18:32:14 At 2:30pm  I got a correlation buy signal for the Crude Oil WTI Futures (CLQ18) and USO on my software.
2963 2018-06-26 18:32:05 One elected official recognized his authority but complained the court didn't address question of whether it was the "right thing to do."  4 clearly put rightness/emotion over constitutionality
2964 2018-06-26 18:32:04 I learned ML coding in 1975.  It's thrilling to find anyone interested, and more so when they "get it".  I believe if a person is interested, they can persevere until they understand.  With oil painting, I didn't believe I was artistic until I did enough to "get it". /1

2966 2018-06-26 18:31:50 السلام عليكم 

حاب استفسر عن الشركة هذي في أبوظبي ABU DHABI COSMO OIL AND GAS (ADCOG)-UAE.

تعرف عنها شي او هل هي موجوده فعلا ؟
2967 2018-06-26 18:31:45 Who said anything about feelings- it’s a fact Saudi Arabia was the country of origin of the men who killed 3,000 Americans Pakistan is constantly harboring terrorists & yet they are not on the list why cuz we need to seek weapons to Saudi Arabia and we need their cheap oil
2968 2018-06-26 18:31:36 Awww, and what a sweet little oil collection it is! Thanks so much for sharing the love with us today! 
2969 2018-06-26 18:31:32 A snake oil salesman and snake oil consumers!
2970 2018-06-26 18:31:17 This may sound simplistic, but can’t we just use less oil? 
These companies that produce miracle beauty products that suddenly turn you into a supermodel when you use them... they must be pretty clever to do that. So they should be able to make stuff without oil.
2971 2018-06-26 18:31:16 Sam just told me when she was younger she used to eat baby oil
2972 2018-06-26 18:31:15 I'm with ya there...lavender oil is a sweet way to find some calm in the crazy.  Hugs.
2973 2018-06-26 18:31:10 That's exactly what I was thinking. Used to have to load a 1 ton tank of rapeseed oil (fuel) on my Isuzu crew-cab. Some sort of lift would have been seriously handy.
2974 2018-06-26 18:31:05 HAHAHAHA ... Alberta's oïl companies are subsidized to the roof, it just doesn't show on paper for political reasons.
2975 2018-06-26 18:30:59 I'm not even mad about not going, that oil change got me fucked up!..
2976 2018-06-26 18:30:45 SA played the market well. They got to increase output while preventing a fall. That's "talking it up" folks.
2977 2018-06-26 18:30:38 Go to the Gulf of Mexico and see the effects of oil pollution in the ocean. NO PIPELINE!!!
2978 2018-06-26 18:30:34 Is flaxseed oil the option to go with?  I read an article on it being scientifically the way to go, but its hard to find fresh enough to use.

2982 2018-06-26 18:30:24 In that case, God, can you help us account for the murdered and missing Indigenous women? If that's too hard, how about income inequality? Or the cost of food in remote territories? Maybe just tell us how to prevent oil spills? Sorry, I love Canada. But we're not heaven.
2983 2018-06-26 18:30:13 A roasted, wonderful orb made of oil paint that wants to help you with your homework.
2984 2018-06-26 18:30:11 Your logic is impeccable Simon. Seriously, what can one buy that isn't someone else's liability & that has good odds of retaining its LT purchasing power? Not much unless you happen to have an oil tanker moored in the back yard pool or a spare 747 hanger.
2985 2018-06-26 18:30:05 Where's the option for "I rotate my tires at every oil change and make sure I keep a portion of my budget for the eventual, inevitable moment where I need to get four Mr Feelgoods (™®@_JonWood)" at?
2986 2018-06-26 18:30:04 @LindaFoods loved Linda McCartney sausages until I find out they use palm oil... why?!?  so disappointing
2987 2018-06-26 18:30:03 I know but still feel a bit responsible for adding oil to the fire

2990 2018-06-26 18:29:34 Since passing of long-time Saudi king, have you not read abt changes like allowing women to drive, interesting death of some strict moslem Saudi family members, OPEC ramping up oil production to drop world prices (as encouraged by Trump)? 

Behind the scenes, baby!
2991 2018-06-26 18:29:34 None of those accounts were empty. And lest you forget, the presidency complained about tge reserves because, that was supposed to be oyr shock absorbers for the oil price decline like it happened in 2008.
2992 2018-06-26 18:29:21 My girlfriend is moving soon and also wants to buy a gallon of olive oil, but she’s waiting to move first so she doesn’t have to move the olive oil.

That’s something a Nobel thinker would do.
2993 2018-06-26 18:29:17 That Muslim illegal asylum seeker needs his ass thrown in jail and then deported. Throwing hot oil on that janitor and the two police officers is attempted murder!
2994 2018-06-26 18:29:15 @jimrome you are the king of outside sales, you are plugging all sorts of oil, zyppa, and Casper mattresses
2995 2018-06-26 18:29:14 Coconut oil is an occlusive moisturizer and traps the moisture beneath the skin and aggravates acne—clogs pores :/
2996 2018-06-26 18:29:11 I bought one sundried tomato dipping oil last year , super yum and versatile it was . Used it for everything from crackers to pasta
2997 2018-06-26 18:29:09 Not a surprise! Plastic is made of oil!

3001 2018-06-26 18:28:56 .@realDonaldTrump   OPEC is at it again! Oil up almost 4% today. 

thx
3002 2018-06-26 18:28:52 I never thought it all that comforting, with a rod and staff, oil and enemies. But yes, it's probably a top choice I get for dying/funerals.
3003 2018-06-26 18:28:51 What type of oil, glycerine or pig fat/oil
3004 2018-06-26 18:28:49 Saddam was right but US  & ISRAIL cudnt see their soliderity ..ppl was happy to Saddam ..US only wantz to occupy their Oil wealth .So they destroy all Iraq wid Saddam .Now they r doing same wid Sirya ...and i think next on hit list is IRAN

3009 2018-06-26 18:27:57 Yes, I can change a tire all by my little old woman-ass self. I can also drive a standard and change my own oil. 

I'd take a bus because I don't own a car. I guess in your book that makes me unamerican or something.
3010 2018-06-26 18:27:56 Shell, total, GE and more are doing as they please there. Onne, one of the biggest oil towns once went for 3 months with dry fuel pumps whilst MNCs shipped out barrels daily
3011 2018-06-26 18:27:46 Idk why my car thinks I have new tire money. Bitch I just changed your oil! Stfu
3012 2018-06-26 18:27:41 I find that you will not allow a vote on the final deal a disgrace. So undemocratic. Most people voted for snake oil because the right wing newspapers told them they would be better off. It won't. They have been lied to. So give people a chance to vote on reality not lies.
3013 2018-06-26 18:27:37 Bbe you should've used tissue oil before applying it
3014 2018-06-26 18:27:35 @heavyhitterstpc hey guys, I love your products, especially the Strawberry Cough (: but yesterday my cartridge shattered out of nowhere... It still held like 70% of my oil ): can you guys help me out somehow?
3015 2018-06-26 18:27:32 It’s never been fair but because this government has put policies in place that directly and negatively impacts the oil sector they need to also review the impacts of those same policies on the have provinces ability to continue with the status quo
3016 2018-06-26 18:27:30 Superb! It could be a fabulous oil painting. Just can't stop looking at that beautiful face. Thank you Bill.
3017 2018-06-26 18:27:21 Hey Duck.  To make the statement that “all oil and gas producers are greedy exploiters” tells me enough about you to know that it is not worth my time arguing anything, and I mean anything, with you. So see ya.

3021 2018-06-26 18:26:51 Tell that to China, Russia or India.  You have shitty public transport because of the history of vested interests of the oil and car industries. It is not geography, it is policy.  Other, bigger nations have done a much better job.

3025 2018-06-26 18:26:16 Dear Mr. Alixandre, I'm so very sorry but we are not sending our Best. Mr. Pence and trump are bandits in their own right. I would caution you to be on guard. He probably is there to steal oil, or choose a leader for you to elect. Much love!!
3026 2018-06-26 18:25:52 Are oil companies causing shortages to keep the supply and demand higher to inflate oil prices? Sometimes we blame countries admins and sometimes oil companies. What is the real answer?@cvpayne
3027 2018-06-26 18:25:42 CRUDE OIL is rising, WTI has moved 200 PIPS higher and is attacking the magical 70 USD per barrel. GOLD is UNDER PRESSURE and WALLSTREET fluctuating.

3035 2018-06-26 18:24:01 Oh how I love the Shimmer Body Oil 
Not only is it super shimmery it’s also super moisturising and smells of summer 
This is as close to makeup as I’ve been for 2 weeks and it’s made me sparkle 
3036 2018-06-26 18:24:00 That's because they're using it as an excuse to go after any Republican.  These people are capable of more savagery than I would have guessed.
3037 2018-06-26 18:23:51 Not a chance of that happening even knowing 9-11 World Trade Center bombers supposedly came from there. But that OIL and MONEY that benefits the wealthy corporations, Trump and the Republicans agenda.

3058 2018-06-26 18:22:06 Did you know that Fort Knox is empty. There's no gold to back the paper that replaced it, and very likely the last time it housed anything of value it was the Crown Jewels of England? Did you know we have capped oil wells and fenced off veins of gold just sitting.
3059 2018-06-26 18:21:58 my father had few jags from mk x/420g mk2s xj6s but his favorite 4.2 daimler sovereign drove it years oil men loved big cars taught me to drive in his  his jags miss them him to sadly no longer with us true gentleman taught me respect courtesy,love jaguars had few current xjs
3060 2018-06-26 18:21:58 Ummm lavender oil on the forehead or peppermint oil on the temples!! Also a hot bath might help you relax but prob do it with the lights off
3061 2018-06-26 18:21:52 旦那にとって忘れ難い、捨て難い「夢」である龍之介………
3062 2018-06-26 18:21:49 someone seriously stop me from buying personal hygiene/hair products because the reason why i have hundreds of moisturizers, body butter/milk, shampoos, conditioners, hair oil/sprays, body lotions, shower gels, exfoliants and many more is because I HAVE NO CONTROL AND I NEED HELP
3063 2018-06-26 18:21:44 Dude fuck the garage honestly. I’m here to get my oil changed for 30 dollars not get my asshole reamed, and my wallet stolen.
3064 2018-06-26 18:21:30 This is my first time ever getting an oil change lol where is a good place to go?
3065 2018-06-26 18:21:29 Because those countries give us oil have major deals with us to buy weapons spend big $ in the states bodying property giving loans to people like trump
3066 2018-06-26 18:21:23 No, there are no moderates in that coalition of awful ideology. 

They're all there for equally horrid reasons. They think he'll protect their oil investments, or end the world according to prophecy, or keep the brown people out, or tear down every last liberal institution
3067 2018-06-26 18:21:16 His love affair with coal is just meant to slow down progress of renewable energy and prop up oil and gas. He has to understand that coal is done.
3068 2018-06-26 18:21:08 .@realDonaldTrump may really be playing "3D Chess" w/ Europe? Scaring them into Tariffs in order to force them into adopting Iran sanctions. Europe is trying to stick to the Iran Deal for the Oil. Higher prices have really hurt Europe & sanctions would be the lesser of 2 evils.
3069 2018-06-26 18:21:02 #trin we start again, debt free, cash in the bank, oil perky, let’s hope the bod have a better rabbit to pull out of the hat  than the last rns @Trinity_PLC @WalbrookPR @IChronicle @SHARESmag @mgrahamwood
3070 2018-06-26 18:20:58 That flu wasn't anything coconut oil couldn't fix
3071 2018-06-26 18:20:55 They won't!  The last three instances have been only women, and in the last case, the men doing it were considerably large men.  We have gotten to a point where grown men can gang up on a female unprovoked from the opposite side of the political fence, and it's cheered on.
3072 2018-06-26 18:20:46 Oh yea I meant the roughness lmao it tastes fine  try a dressing that’s not so fatty like lemon juice and olive oil with some seasoning maybe?
3073 2018-06-26 18:20:44 Esther got me African shea butter, lavender oil, & incense knows me so well
3074 2018-06-26 18:20:39 #NGRARG this our Saudi Arabia jersey no get oil
3075 2018-06-26 18:20:34 You wake up!... they're people out there way more wealthy than Trump...  it's never mattered who has been in power.. it has been 100 years of catering to Big Oil... don't even act like the Democrats gave a s*** when Obama approved all the fracking
3076 2018-06-26 18:20:32 As someone who has never owned a Ford I didn't actually know that. Of course to me it doesn't seem unusual, my Subaru recommends that I only use Mobile 1 brand oil
3077 2018-06-26 18:20:32 that could help! I have a steam diffuser that was pretty handy for helping me sleep on really bad nights when I was still at my last (real toxic) job (thx lavender oil!) so maybe I should make a habit of running it more often
3078 2018-06-26 18:20:27 All the oil and electricity Tunis got from libya over the years yet Tunisians have the audacity to talk shit about the country smh ungrateful shitheads  
3079 2018-06-26 18:20:19 Crude oil prices jump after WH expect world to cut Iranian oil imports to zero by Nov.
3080 2018-06-26 18:19:54 I hate youtubers or people who say “i have oily skin. I got oil all over my face like in the T AREA” dear shista n brotha u have combi skin honey
3081 2018-06-26 18:19:52 C’mon #Nigeria put more work like y’all put it in those emails of you owning oil well and giving the benefits to a total stranger from a refugee camp. #NGAARG
3082 2018-06-26 18:19:43 Cheniere Energy CEO Jack Fusco, on higher oil prices and the potential impact on other commodities, such as natural gas,, "That's what keeps me up at night." #WGC2018
3083 2018-06-26 18:19:36 What percentage of our Oil comes from Iran, and is it part of stockpile, reserve, or real-time use...more importantly what do users of Synthetic fuels think?
3084 2018-06-26 18:19:20 These white women at Lexus looking at me crazy....

Could be because of my skin... My tats... 

Who knows... Who cares

They ain't paying for this oil change....lol
3085 2018-06-26 18:19:12 Olive oil or tin foil
3086 2018-06-26 18:19:00 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
3087 2018-06-26 18:19:00 Google is like a modern clairvoyant. It just saw that I am almost out of hempseed oil. And I am just reading 1984. #spooked #bigbrotheriswatchingyou
3088 2018-06-26 18:18:56 Red Water.
Early 2000's shark film.
They knew they didn't have much of a shark so they threw in a bit of disaster (malfunctioning oil rig) and criminals (nasty treasure hunters)
Tries hard but ultimately mediocre.
3089 2018-06-26 18:18:51 Hmm, E3 assumes a reduction in California oil refining output.  Is that the first time they have done that?  I know ARB is looking at "supply side" oil&climate policy some but didn't know about CEC
3090 2018-06-26 18:18:49 India is the key, but I think India is too involved in Port and rail deals and is bartering much of the oil for service and assets
3091 2018-06-26 18:18:42 And then get your blood work!  I am getting blood work done next week so fat bombing via olive oil for 3 days before
3092 2018-06-26 18:18:37 no, pressure groups producing non peer reviewed reports that cherry pick data to suit their own prejudices is snake oil.
3093 2018-06-26 18:18:32 & my box be slippery like he walking on oil 
3094 2018-06-26 18:18:28 He's not a BUSINESS MAN. HE'S A BANKRUPTCY MAN. BECAUSE OF rump's ACUMEN, HARLEY DAVIDSON IS GOING OVERSEAS. Nothing more American than Harley. SNAKE OIL PUSHER @JMW14FLASH
3095 2018-06-26 18:18:24 You are correct but we got a very good Declaration of Independence  gift today!  A win in court for Trump! I call on Legend to leave the country ! Sarah has done nothing! You are un-American our beliefs are as oil & water! Sorry ! Such a wast e b/c God gave you a beautiful voice
3096 2018-06-26 18:18:17 Can I oil you up

3099 2018-06-26 18:17:57 Had to leave work early today thanks to @ToyotaCanada messing something up after my oil change earlier this month. I have to take time out of my work day to deal with this. That’s not cool. 
3100 2018-06-26 18:17:56 I’m trying to get a syringe to fuck with the oil in my cartridges but if my mom finds it I have no idea how I’m going to explain that
3101 2018-06-26 18:17:53 The gringo government is very worried. AMLO win could mean bankruptcy for the states. The gringos economy depend on the oil and money from drugs to keep the economy running, plus all the privileges NAFTA means to the states. A prosperous Mexico is a threat to the US.
3102 2018-06-26 18:17:26 I had forgotten how amazing coconut oil leaves my hair after a treatment  hopefully my hair stays healthy after my trip to the salon tomorrow! 
3103 2018-06-26 18:17:17 i know that if your ear pains, my Granny used to warm oil and garlic and put in into my ears with a small piece of cotton, if that helps 
3104 2018-06-26 18:17:10 Frank Hill @subaru_usa in National City’s customer service is shockingly professional. I had to double check to make sure I wasn’t getting an oil change in a Chik-Fil-A.
3105 2018-06-26 18:17:10 last time i came to get my oil change they were playing hgtv in the waiting room and now they are playing some soccer game plz put hgtv back on
3106 2018-06-26 18:16:50 Was wondering if you had thoughts on CBD oil and epilepsy.  Clearly, Keto has other benefits :)
3107 2018-06-26 18:16:41 The Saudi oil power ..
3108 2018-06-26 18:16:36 Reminds a story about hydroelectric generator (using oil film levitation support) fully operational and not requiring any repairs after 60+ years of continous service (should work for thousand of years engineer said IIRC)
3109 2018-06-26 18:16:36 @JetBlue I have small bottles that are open of beard oil and other beard product. Can that go in my carry-on?
3110 2018-06-26 18:16:29 Watching #NGAARG and culinary inspiration strikes: courgette salad with pistachios and a lime & avocado oil dressing. Thank you Nigeria! #culinaryinspiration #foodie #salad #eatmoreveg #foodforlife #Nigeria #nigeriastrip #greenisgood
3111 2018-06-26 18:16:21 The oil burns on my arm are finally fading! Success!
3112 2018-06-26 18:16:02 Brazilian state oil company Petrobras announced it would pay almost $3B USD in reparations to U.S. investors who were harmed by the corruption ring within the firm. Brazil’s largest company was sued in a class action lawsuit, which was approved June 22 by a federal court in NY.
3113 2018-06-26 18:16:01 I'd make a paste of rosemary, parsley and thyme, a couple cloves of garlic, some salt and black pepper and enough olive oil to bring it together into a thick paste. Rub that on the inside of it, roll the leg up and tie it together, then roast at 325 until it hits 125-130.
3114 2018-06-26 18:15:55 Oil all on my jeans I’m a lil upset 
3115 2018-06-26 18:15:48 There are steroid injections you can get right into the joint- i forget the name, but it has helped me avoid surgery in my hands- but if this is about your dog- check his nails, when they get too long its hard to walk- often mistaken for arthritis- or try some CBD oil
3116 2018-06-26 18:15:43 getting an oil change and watching Nigeria vs. Argentina apparently
3117 2018-06-26 18:15:40 Olive oil, cherry tomatoes, basil and salt. Cottage cheese 4 eva
3118 2018-06-26 18:15:29 Cage plays a mole who is a secret agent who guards the cantankerous former First Lady and helps Louisiana recover from the BP oil spill. In the end, he is gunned down by police. Gina Gershon costars.
3119 2018-06-26 18:15:09 @elonmusk does great work with tesla on eco friendly cars. However maybe try and make a commercially available vegetable oil powered car?
3120 2018-06-26 18:15:09 Ezemmuo, I hereby present full gallon of red oil to appease the gods. If u need more things, please I'm available to offer as long as they deliver us from the hands of the Argentines.
3121 2018-06-26 18:15:04 Senior State Department official says ; Oil imports from Iran to “zero” by Nov. 4 or risk sanctions
3122 2018-06-26 18:15:01 #innoplastbio Project going forward: @OrklaGroup will supply used cooking oil (from chips) to Nafigate/Bochemie, which will produce PHA that will be used for Orkla's cosmetic products. #bioplastics
3123 2018-06-26 18:14:59 Does she use an oil with it?
3124 2018-06-26 18:14:37 At the mechanic getting an oil change for my smartcar and I'm crying laughing. You change the oil from the trunk, and the look on dudes face when my hood popped off is golden.
3125 2018-06-26 18:14:33 Neolibertarianism Liz? That's snake oil!  Abolishing any law that stops us doing what we want means the powerful win... Wealthy people like us will tell the less fortunate what to do and when to do it.. . That would be dandy, BUT we actually care about them, so.... No.
3126 2018-06-26 18:14:32 They will give you the women and kids, the animals, the gemstones and oil... for a pack of gum and 2 damn cows or some non black pussy
3127 2018-06-26 18:14:32 went early and got a car wash, paid my registration, took mikes car for a smog test and oil change, now going to target for better a better laundry hamper. why am I a 35 year old woman.
3128 2018-06-26 18:14:31 What does the oil do for it? I’ve never used an oil for my foundation.
3129 2018-06-26 18:14:31 Don't need a voucher. I need them to clean their oil.
3130 2018-06-26 18:14:26 I still don’t understand why people get an oil change at 7am?
3131 2018-06-26 18:14:25 75%

3132 2018-06-26 18:14:12 My mom made a tissue oil that’s gonna help me with my anxiety  I can’t tell you guys how happy I am
3133 2018-06-26 18:13:53 Start marinating it now. Salt, pepper, mint, parsley, garlic, cumin or chili flakes, lemon, olive oil.

Roast it later. Boom.
3134 2018-06-26 18:13:50 #SouthSudan Our oil and resource is a RED LINE, it has nothing to do with HLRF.

3135 2018-06-26 18:13:49 bought waterpaint not remembering it slides right off canvases.  I should’ve gotten oil, or more acrylic.
3136 2018-06-26 18:13:47 Car inspected and oil changed 
3137 2018-06-26 18:13:46 Stealing..... Achoo!* Stealing oil from other countries! cough cough* Sorry, I'm allergic to bullshit.
3138 2018-06-26 18:13:37 Wow the FDA actually has recognized CBD Oil as a treatment for epilepsy. It’s a miracle! Now when will you recognize the hundreds of other uses for it?
3139 2018-06-26 18:13:36 Just went for a swim in a pool full of Italian salad oil and I’ve never felt more olive.
3140 2018-06-26 18:13:31 She put £££ into the business
3141 2018-06-26 18:13:26 Exactly. @CurrencyWar1 had also flagged role of oil in the recent move lower in trade-weighted RMB, which I had missed.
3142 2018-06-26 18:13:10 So all my rich Michigan GOPPERs with the million dollar plus view cottages on the Great Lakes. If you thought wind turbines were bad bet you can’t wait for those oil derricks to go in around Mackinac Island, TC, Charlevoix and Caseville. And not one word from Calley or Schuette.
3143 2018-06-26 18:12:55 GWB couldn’t identify where an oil filter is located much less run the country.  That’s why a business man was elected,  3.2 million magic wand jobs in Trumps 1st 500 days.  RESULTS OVER RESIST!
3144 2018-06-26 18:12:49 HAHAHAHAHA sana “oil” ampota 
3145 2018-06-26 18:12:44 Starch, oil and some proteins? Beta carotene?
3146 2018-06-26 18:12:41 WooooW
3147 2018-06-26 18:12:32 I see. You think video is conclusive scientific proof. Try Sesame Street. Actually, I meant recent claims that paying 8 times book value for a leaky old pipeline to ship dilbit to markets where the price of oil is less than the cost of refining dilbit could grow Canada’s economy.
3148 2018-06-26 18:12:25 I'm on my second month of evening primrose oil and have noticed the lethargy has subsided quite a lot. I went for Solgar brand 1300mg
3149 2018-06-26 18:12:14 Legend has it that there is oil on Migingo
3150 2018-06-26 18:12:11 This has me stumped! Is it part of the Fresnel Lens housing when the lamps were lit with whale oil?
3151 2018-06-26 18:11:59 Vitamin E oil!
3152 2018-06-26 18:11:47 Is this what they call “snake’s oil seller”?
3153 2018-06-26 18:11:42 Geez, did you put some high-viscosity car oil on your face????? lmao
3154 2018-06-26 18:11:25 A Tesla that uses bean oil
3155 2018-06-26 18:11:24 Snake oil laced with arsenic in some cases.
3156 2018-06-26 18:11:18 Coconut is good stuff  I think carrot oil is best for the deep tan

3159 2018-06-26 18:10:59 Ksa, qatar & uae ducked the oil, because you know we don't wanna piss off some oil lobbies!
On a side note #FuckTrump he can gag my Halal balls.
3160 2018-06-26 18:10:57 poly urethane turns yellow from oil and sun exposure
3161 2018-06-26 18:10:50 We should start our own news network BSNBC, would be more accurate than CNBC
3162 2018-06-26 18:10:45 Been in the sun all day with oil on and I’ve not tanned or burnt yet my GINGER boyfriend sent me a picture from holiday and he looks sooo tanned. To top it off, my mums family is Maltese yet I have zero benefits from this 
3163 2018-06-26 18:10:44 I tell myself everyday I need to go get my oil changed in my car ....
3164 2018-06-26 18:10:40 I believe China has already began purchasing food & oil from Russia. Who else will follow suit? The real question is why is he distancing our allies & increasing our military? So we will have WWIII. USA part of Axis not Allies.
3165 2018-06-26 18:10:35 Dickheads of the world have figured out that a large portion of their populations are morons. Morons that will believe anything as long as they think it will benefit them. It is truly the decade of the snake oil salesman.
3166 2018-06-26 18:10:25 Ahh. Hahaha enjoy enjoy kana be. Sana oil
3167 2018-06-26 18:10:18 the tories sold out the Scottish steel and fishing industry to join the common market in the 70's then they took Scottish oil. The UK and EU both prospered at Scotlands expense, modern day colonialism on both fronts.
3168 2018-06-26 18:10:15 Just the usual.  Smoke screen, oil slick, and caltrops.  Maybe forward firing rockets.
3169 2018-06-26 18:10:13 US LNG exporters are pausing export expansion plans due to trade uncertainty with China (where LNG demand is growing fast). 

Now the US is telling China not to import oil from Iran.
3170 2018-06-26 18:10:05 これはおっぱいじゃなくて油の貯蔵庫だよ。最悪の事態の時はここから、ね。
3171 2018-06-26 18:10:05 Still lowkey butthurt cause they tried to charge me over $400 for stripping my oil pan. Where’s the integrity at man lol.
3172 2018-06-26 18:10:03 Just a little bit of oil, and... Come on! Come on, you little son of a bitch!
3173 2018-06-26 18:09:58 It is cheaper per barrel for oil sand extraction than North Dakota fracking barrels.
3174 2018-06-26 18:09:46 Let's see dollar making higher highs, high oil prices, emerging markets getting smoked, China currency devaluation, trade wars but there will be no contagion to DM's lol. Ok #OOTT #qqq #SPX
3175 2018-06-26 18:09:34 Need a volunteer to oil my scalp
3176 2018-06-26 18:09:33 Y'all can't convince me that of some the lads I play football with at Cedar Grove and West Indies oil field not better than some of these, all they got over them is discipline tbh but my word, some pros real rubbish mate
3177 2018-06-26 18:09:31 Really though politely asking someone who is helping bring back internment camps to leave your store is pretty civil

I would have dumped hot oil on them *shrug*
3178 2018-06-26 18:09:27 Autocannons, caltrops and oil slick.
3179 2018-06-26 18:09:12 Your lies make Trump look like George Washington! Not only did Chevron ADMIT it polluted the Amazon by dumping BILLIONS of gallons of oil wastewater, but the evidence is still there. It’s amazing anyone publishes the outright falsehoods you peddle. Wow.
3180 2018-06-26 18:08:18 To be fair, threatening allies not to buy Iranian oil is a pretty good way to give U.S. shale a leg up in the world. So where is the dollar going again?
3181 2018-06-26 18:08:16 I use different ones sometimes I use the drunk elephant virgin marula oil or the josie marin oil 
3182 2018-06-26 18:08:15 Don't laugh but Sanjeev Kapoor's Daals and Kadhis - as  Parsi family, we have very few veg recipes, and the daals in this are really, really good, and the recipes are spot on. We only adjust the oil/butter/ghee used.
3183 2018-06-26 18:08:11 good job my oil king
3184 2018-06-26 18:08:09 Save The Orangutans. DON'T buy these sweets as they contain a large amount of Palm Oil that cones from the trees that the Orangutans live and feed. 
If @Lord_Sugar goes Palm Oil free then I'll gladly buy 10 mixed boxes and donate them to charity as a prize.
3185 2018-06-26 18:08:07 When at least some of what we are going to get could have been avoided if we had acted sooner but big oil was only interested in big profits
3186 2018-06-26 18:07:57 The fish oil from real Salmon is what gets my brain humming.  Watch out for frankenfish & toxic farm antibiotic poisoned substitutes though.
3187 2018-06-26 18:07:55 I did the gross tea tree oil + dental floss method for one on my inner thigh panty line... do not recommend unless you’re a stone cold warrior
3188 2018-06-26 18:07:53 I'm sure glad that OPEC decided to RAISE production, oil is over $70 per barrel.
I would hate to see where it would have gone if they kept the cuts.
the trade talks should speak to their price fixing.
3189 2018-06-26 18:07:42 You can take your religious views, oil them up, and then proceed to shove them up your ass. 
That’s how much I care about them.
3190 2018-06-26 18:07:30 Ohhhh I have some lavender essential oil!
3191 2018-06-26 18:07:30 Need a nigga that’s gone oil my scalp
3192 2018-06-26 18:07:17 Air con isn't part of a standard service - that's just oil, filters, and the like.

3194 2018-06-26 18:07:02 #ftsemoves Oil price rise helped but no clear indication that 23 day (so far) Segmental correction is over ay yesterday's low of 7508. FTSE closed @ 7538 but futures have it at 7580 as I write.

Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.

I pray for her healing... I pray for her love ones to find strength an patience.

3207 2018-06-26 18:05:54 China is buying all of Iran’s oil. What a huge lie
3208 2018-06-26 18:05:36 Baby oil....
3209 2018-06-26 18:05:24 That would be a fair comparison but for it to be a true apples to apples comparison North Dakota's oil would also have to be oilsands and\or their industry costs of extraction were the same.
3210 2018-06-26 18:05:21 So sad and  unnecessary, when grown and sourced ethically Palm oil can be a good sustainable ingredient. Thankfully the @RSPOtweets and @WWF are doing a great job in creating awareness and making a positive change but still lots to be done.
3211 2018-06-26 18:05:20 Anointing oil cover our post. BLOCK IT.

3215 2018-06-26 18:05:09 But it’s 30% coconut oil 70% genes
3216 2018-06-26 18:04:53 Surprise surprise! -- Saudi Arabia plans to pump up to 11 million barrels of #oil in July, the highest in its history, up from about 10.8 million bpd in June, an industry source familiar with #Saudi oil production plans told Reuters #energy #crude
3217 2018-06-26 18:04:52 Day 5 of using CBD oil... No noticeable differences in my mental state, but hoping by the end of 30 days I'll start to notice a change for the better.

3220 2018-06-26 18:04:42 Its not surprising. I’ve had many liberals tell me my family belonged in camp because it was for the good of the country.
3221 2018-06-26 18:04:41 I use coconut oil instead lol
3222 2018-06-26 18:04:32 HOLY OIL IM DEA
3223 2018-06-26 18:04:31 Probably not! I had a girlfriend tell me her car “just stopped working” but it had no oil... 

I had a flat tire coming home from college & the 10 miles later, the spare went flat...
3224 2018-06-26 18:04:30 @DanielYergin at @HouseCommerce #oil, #gas hearing: Without the shale revolution, the U.S. would be importing large volumes of oil and gas, our trade balance would be dramatically different, millions of jobs would not exist, and the U.S. would be less competitive.
3225 2018-06-26 18:04:24 Getting a oil change i was well over due for one 
3226 2018-06-26 18:04:15 #TheScriptSummer Mark @thescript a guy in my work was telling me about beard oil today. Is it something you use to keep your facial hair in check?
3227 2018-06-26 18:03:53 Making massive gigantic profits for big oil.  It's our children and their children who are going to have to pay the price of their greed

3231 2018-06-26 18:03:22 Hmmm like when George Bush was saying, we're pumping our last drops of oil right now. Or when he insisted there were weapons of mass destruction. Or when he totally deregulated banks and didn't know why they failed.
3232 2018-06-26 18:03:19 Just learned that pea crisps are actually ground up peas mixed with canola oil and rice meal then baked in the shape of pea pods. They are pretty much nutritionally equivalent to potato chips. It makes so much more sense tbh.
3233 2018-06-26 18:03:18 your oil can't run low because you never filled yourself, God did that, the Lord controls the flow!

3238 2018-06-26 18:02:53 The growth rate of China? Things are different now, remember China has a small current account deficit now, and has capital controls that will limit outflows.  This will hurt harder than before

3242 2018-06-26 18:02:47 Cannot wait to get my shipment of some new CBD oil that I'm excited to try  
3243 2018-06-26 18:02:45 You guys need cryogenic undershirts. That room seems like it’s an oven. If you want to cut it short, i mix hummus and straight garlic paste with olive oil so it gets in your pores. (My wife always knows when i have shawarma). It will make everyone hungry and break for lunch.
3244 2018-06-26 18:02:37 Yes, please try it. CBD oil is the only thing that has helped me with my severe ptsd and my anxiety.

3263 2018-06-26 18:01:09 If rift are not agreeing on their own, how do you expect the rest to trust you. Riftvalley put politics aside and start producing maize or we import from Mexico. Turkana oil is white rhino for now
3264 2018-06-26 18:00:54 Has anyone used the CBD oil from Holland and Barrett? Is it any good, recommendations?
3265 2018-06-26 18:00:52 Nice try Liz. In reality you're the preachers of bankruptcy. Bankruptcy for tens of thousands of contractors in I.T., health care, engineering, oil and gas, due to the #2019LoanCharge. Disgusting retrospective legislation that has no place in a  democracy.

3270 2018-06-26 18:00:19 Choppy waters at Faroe Petroleum AGM today.
Chairman John Bentley had 39% vote against, exec pay 35% against.
'Single large shareholder' was the reason, we're told, which must mean Norway oil investor DNO. It has a 29% stake, and is seen as having takeover plans.
3271 2018-06-26 18:00:17 Obvious! If intl. prices fall taxes also fall proportionately! Initially Govt. did increase taxes, but it had to pay ₹120,000 crores pending oil bills to Iran & makeup 90,000 crores of unpaid subsidy to oil companies! UPA legacy. Still about 20,000 crores pending to Iran!

3275 2018-06-26 17:59:52 Hello, Canada? 

Please do the world, especially the United States, a HUGE favor and stop  sending us your tar sands oil.  Shut down the pipelines.  Halt the  ships. You're looking for a way to get back at Trump.  And I don't blame you. 

This would really get his goat!
3276 2018-06-26 17:59:50 America we can not build Empassys in our country that protect Terrorist they are trying to get one built in Houston Texas.  Protect our Ports.  To much oil and the pipeline comes thru our state and we will be lighting up a big area crippling America.  Stop this Empassy.
3277 2018-06-26 17:59:39 Oil of the South Sudan  is the only solution out of the problem of foreign currency in Sudan ... The plan is political  not humanitarian
3278 2018-06-26 17:59:37 The Trump administration is quite candid about its effort to economically isolate Iran (again) and to recruit other countries to do the same. From today's @StateDept background briefing: 
Q: Is the U.S. pushing allies to cut oil imports to zero? (by November) 
A: Yes.
3279 2018-06-26 17:59:36 Iranien people pay for this not IRGC or Iranian government:
« The Trump administration says all countries must stop buying Iranian oil by November 4 or they will be subject to US sanctions. This includes their closest allies. »#IranDeal
3280 2018-06-26 17:59:35 I have recently ordered some and use it as a pre shampoo treatment on my scalp and coconut oil on my strands! Makes my hair seem thicker/softer/healthier!
3281 2018-06-26 17:59:33 with cronies and energy industry shills than one might have  already  suspected. In fact, Pruitt was so sloppy, he just asked oil  companies to  send over resumes and solicited staffing recommendations  from his  lobbyist landlord.
3282 2018-06-26 17:59:31 A very low hanging fruit is stopping subsidies to biodiesel. #biofuels generate needless extra demand for vegetable oil. We can release millions of ha of production to food while saving money & GHG. Do you have the courage to say it?

3290 2018-06-26 17:58:25 You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say, they have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles.
3291 2018-06-26 17:58:25 I wish health insurance would pay for CBD oil:(

3294 2018-06-26 17:58:10 probably not, but in the big picture, how, exactly, does China plan to get around these sanctions and keep importing as much Iranian oil as it does? There's only so much renminbi the Iranian government can accept...
3295 2018-06-26 17:58:04 I hate going to get my oil changed

3318 2018-06-26 17:55:48 Maybe it use or the lack thereof? 
3319 2018-06-26 17:55:43 Was thinking the same thing... and what to make of it.  I’ve been looking at opportunities to get more long oil stocks but this action is a little discouraging.  Makes me think I might get a better opportunity lower soon.
3320 2018-06-26 17:55:42 I don't believe there is, so it could simply be called sunflower oil.  #unnecessarylabeling
3321 2018-06-26 17:55:30 I mean “can I oil you up?” does sound like some shit I’d say but mind my privacy man 
3322 2018-06-26 17:55:25 so stupid..we need to stop using oil, plastic is killing our planet!
3323 2018-06-26 17:55:20 There are! Just make sure you oil them up both sides with olive oil before you put it in the oven. A lot healthier and less stodgy

3334 2018-06-26 17:53:53 Then why do charts show Canada’s oil exports are increasing while China’s go down?
3335 2018-06-26 17:53:46 damage done is the biggest concern.  It sure appears big oil want their 10% back and smells blood.

3337 2018-06-26 17:53:32 ‘ I have found David my servant;
with my holy oil have I anointed him.
My hand shall hold him fast

No enemy shall deceive him,
nor any wicked person afflict him.’ That’s reassuring @dailyprayers

3339 2018-06-26 17:53:10 Motorcraft is owned by Ford. Dash is textured to help with glare. And reason for wait to shut off turbo engine at idle is for oil supply to turbo. Engine off and high turbo rpm means cooked bearings

3363 2018-06-26 17:50:24 Marijuana does nothing for me so it has zero percent chance of addiction. I know many who use it occasionally and they are not addicted. It does more than change mood, which is a good thing. It has proven medical benefits that are not psychological. I use CBD oil for pain relief.
3364 2018-06-26 17:50:23 I always do. Plus they do my wheels, check my water and oil not forgetting my windscreen.
3365 2018-06-26 17:50:19 nah clearly it's oil
3366 2018-06-26 17:49:59 What kind of oil do you use?

3370 2018-06-26 17:49:43 What I keep hearing from neighbors and friends in Colorado about CBD Oil:

"CBD Oil! It cures everything! Rub it on your back, no more back pain! Rub it on your tumor--poof!--no more cancer!  Rub it on your bank account and money magically appears!" (slight exaggeration...)
3371 2018-06-26 17:49:32 But hey if you’re goin to give me an oil change for the F, I’ll take it
3372 2018-06-26 17:49:31 Oil and liquor are their milch cows
3373 2018-06-26 17:49:30 I just noticed my ex left a gallon of high quality olive oil in my pantry, unopened.

Looks like I got the last laugh, Brian.

3376 2018-06-26 17:48:51 My satellite radio got turned back on after my last oil change. I forgot how much better it is than regular radio. I've missed you @SXMOctane.
3377 2018-06-26 17:48:49 better with more oil to dip bread
3378 2018-06-26 17:48:41 They're a lot of paint in the oil, turn your brush over and use the other side of the tree to be all flat.

3384 2018-06-26 17:48:06 It’s still early days so you can keep it for now. When you’ve adjusted then you can stick to olive oil & balsamic. Sometimes I use sour cream instead of the creamier dressings, uthi catha iPepper.

3387 2018-06-26 17:47:33 Its almost time to unpin my oil post
3388 2018-06-26 17:47:11 But, like cooking oil in your pan instead of that butter spray, the oil buy in a bottle and dump the spray. plastic and ozone pollution averted

3391 2018-06-26 17:46:56 Fish Oil or Krill Oil.  Take a lot more than the bottle says.  I typically start people on 4 per day (1000 mg per pill) then I drop it to 2 a day after 3 to 5 days.
3392 2018-06-26 17:46:46 Bearish crude oil,,despite today's up move.
3393 2018-06-26 17:46:46 Texans do you know their is a Muslin Doctor in Dayton Ohio who is trying to get a muslin diplomatic representive in Houston an have the Muslim nation to build an Empassy in Houston .  A lot of oil flows thru Houston this move must be stopped.  Join together with me to stop.
3394 2018-06-26 17:46:45 Given the profession you're in, that's a depressing response. I've given you some robust evidence. Challenge the methodology by all means or provide counter-evidence but don't just dismiss because it doesn't fit your paradigm. That way lies snake oil.
3395 2018-06-26 17:46:32 JUST BECAUSE IT IS LEGAL, DOESN’T MEAN IT IS RIGHT.

Question: There were more than a dozen Saudis involvedwith 911, yet they are not on your list.   Why?
Could it be because of money?  Oil?
3396 2018-06-26 17:46:30 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
3397 2018-06-26 17:46:26 WTI jumps after State Dept says oil buyers must cut all Iranian crude imports by November . India  watch chennai petro
3398 2018-06-26 17:46:21 Trust me it’s not as great as it seems once you have car payments pay insurance spend money on oil change and flat tires etc lol but good luck 
3399 2018-06-26 17:46:20 This is just oil and gas companies pushing their BS under an "Independent" flag.

3405 2018-06-26 17:46:06 The opposite: I think the Saudis were proactive in seeing what the problem is in the oil market and boosting production, rather than reactive. I was actually be complementary. Obviously, I failed.

3420 2018-06-26 17:44:26 So here’s my question: is it important that the dollar is used for other things? i.e. if we invented the ZOB and it was used for trading oil and other stuff, would it be a problem that you couldn’t convert it into cash?

3430 2018-06-26 17:43:32 This makes as much sense as if I wanted a new car and went to a dealership and broke in and just took the car of my choice then after I got arrested they would set a court date and give me the car and gas oil and everything to operate it until the court date put a year. Hell yes!
3431 2018-06-26 17:43:20 How can you not respect it. RT @The_Lion_: Hell of a move RT @TheyCallMeNap: “Can I oil you up?” as the opening to your DM is extremely wild lol

3443 2018-06-26 17:41:34 is the coconut oil ethically and sustainably sourced?

3446 2018-06-26 17:41:11 Look at what leading the world in the steel and oil industries did for the US in the second half of the 19th century. We have the opportunity to have that same kind of impact (albeit with less shady business tactics hopefully) in the renewable energy industry and in space
3447 2018-06-26 17:41:06 That members of the Presidential Council are holding a press conference because of oil but not because of the blood spilt in #Derna or the city’s destruction is appalling. Bloody appalling #Libya

3449 2018-06-26 17:41:01 Isn't it a environmental win when Harley Davidson leaves.  Or should we just dump a quart of oil in our garages in memory.

Iran: $68
Kazakhstan: $60
Iraq: $54
Kuwait: $48

3464 2018-06-26 17:39:57 Oil buyers must cut all Iranian crude imports by November, State Dept says. "Source-CNBC." Let me get this straight.

3470 2018-06-26 17:39:09 From my experience of working with many, many crashed dif pump systems, the risk is generally over blown. The pumps are very robust and when used with something like DC704 you can't even damage the oil by crashing to atmosphere. A lot of turbos can survive, but frequently don't.

3484 2018-06-26 17:37:40 Many companies have  too much debt in this space, shale have negative cashflow, PSTD after 2014 :) ( actually real oil price rise only started this year, we will not count 26 - 50 mess :)  )  + narrative
3485 2018-06-26 17:37:33 Because I don't want to commit an abomination if you know u know ...
3486 2018-06-26 17:37:27 Why aren't State Govts decreasing taxes? Govt wants to bring oil in GST, States refuse as an  important  source of income
3487 2018-06-26 17:37:16 So then once we’ve gotten this high concentration of CBD, now we can reintroduce flavors, vitamins, other essential oil terpenes etc. With alcohol you put it in a barrel to pull the flavors, colors, smells etc. Same idea
3488 2018-06-26 17:37:14 I'm not religious, but I do believe there is something out there in the universe far greater than ourselves.

I'm now wondering if we could use pascal's wager to convince the US government that there is oil on Mars...
3489 2018-06-26 17:37:12 Try CBD oil
3490 2018-06-26 17:37:09 When I was a child, I climbed on to the cooker and tried to get out through the kitchen window. I slipped and landed in a pan of boiling oil where someone was making eggs. They thought I'd lose the leg.
3491 2018-06-26 17:37:07 Actually he has made us completely independent of foreign oil. The goal is to be self sustaining.
3492 2018-06-26 17:37:05 Feeling ko ang lagkit lagkit ng eye area ko. Lagkit nung castor oil parang bagong iyak yung feeling.
3493 2018-06-26 17:37:02 Niggas who's first words too a chick through social media is something like "Can I oil ya up" or "Can I fuck" are the niggas who grew up knowing they never had a chance...Those the ones who would just stay quiet if they saw them out and not know how to approach them
3494 2018-06-26 17:36:41 I wonder you are asking, we really are twins
3495 2018-06-26 17:36:27 And a judge in CA threw out 2 lawsuits that the Left brought against 5 major oil companies.  SF and Oakland wanted these big oil companies to pay for “climate change” 
3496 2018-06-26 17:36:23 Which kind of oil? Veg is best?
3497 2018-06-26 17:36:23 石油君はどちらかと言えば生物系に興味ありますねえ
3498 2018-06-26 17:36:18 Exactly, i believe it was your article that made not of daily volume on Silver exchange equates to one and a half years supply, where as oils volume equate too 5 days. Moral to this story the oil Lobbyists have better connections than Silver producers .
3499 2018-06-26 17:36:14 $GE; Selling oil unit, NOW that oil is back over $70/brl Buy high, sell low is NOT the way to do this stuff! Freakin boneheads
3500 2018-06-26 17:36:13 I’m going get me some new tires amd get my oil changed then punch it back to Houston!
3501 2018-06-26 17:36:04 dang I was just trying to keep from soaking than Bolt hat in hydraulic oil. Don't you put that evil on me Ricky Bobby!

3504 2018-06-26 17:35:48 Channeling my inner @SaraJDux today...

Got to hotel in London and beard oil has leaked everywhere

I smell of magic beard herbs and I'm glistening ever so slightly
3505 2018-06-26 17:35:44 Because it’s pure propaganda. You can’t see that? We get the goods they get the trusted dollars?   Dollars which are merely Fiat Currency whose value is narrowly based on how much oil is conveyed in dollars. Ergo the Goods are more valuable than the dollars? Only during inflation
3506 2018-06-26 17:35:43 Oil slick? Do we need to frack in your garden?
3507 2018-06-26 17:35:43 They they also stole the presidentecy, they knew if democrats won, they would have picked the supreme court seat. I think McConell, Ryan, and a bunch of other repulicians knew exactly what was going on with Trump and Putin,
as they want that russian oil, to heep big oil happy.
3508 2018-06-26 17:35:37 Coconut oil trash anyways
3509 2018-06-26 17:35:09 Rudy Giuliani’s former law firm told Bloomberg News that Russian state-run oil company Rosneft is one of its clients. That was just a year after Rosneft had signed a massive deal with  Exxon-Mobil — led by now-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson — to be worth half a trillion dollars
3510 2018-06-26 17:35:05 Jadi sebenernya face oil itu ada di tempatnya sendiri tapi menurutku fungsi face oil lebih mirip kaya fungsi nightcream untuk melembabkam jadi bisa aja nightcreamnya kamu ganti jadi face oil.

Saran sih kalau mimbang produk A bisa diganti enggaknya sama B bandingin fungsinya ajaa
3511 2018-06-26 17:35:02 Merit lived in unison: –Comisaria! Comisaria! Comisaria! Meester Surplus Oil// Working for store, So all the
3512 2018-06-26 17:34:59 Canada is about to dump 16 billion in Tariffs on Red and Swing states products and we may shut down the oil we supply which is 40 percent of your supply and 1/3rd of your electricity and close the only land link to alaska
3513 2018-06-26 17:34:51 Baby oil?
3514 2018-06-26 17:34:40 Time for an oil change 
3515 2018-06-26 17:34:39 Algún adelanto ???
3516 2018-06-26 17:34:34 Put coconut oil in my hair this morning and the bus was so cold it froze my shit
3517 2018-06-26 17:34:31 It’s still oil
3518 2018-06-26 17:34:29 Obama’s didn’t allow oil and coal companies to pollute clean water, he didnt get us to a record breaking debt, he didn’t cause a trade war hurting our farmers and businesses. He didn’t cut our SS. So I guess he didn’t “do” anything.
3519 2018-06-26 17:34:28 Hello! Currently, we only offer Bio-Oil skincare oil.
3520 2018-06-26 17:34:22 Just when I thought he was on his way to ending maritime oil spills... 
3521 2018-06-26 17:34:21 Long weekend? Higher gas prices. Then oil companies will say pump price is the result of crude supply chain from months ago. But by some strange coincidence supply always runs low just before 3 day weekends. You can book it.
3522 2018-06-26 17:34:12 “It will be about an hour to fix your tire and change your oil!” 
2 and a half hours later I’m still waiting for my damn car.. what the hell is going on here don! 
3523 2018-06-26 17:33:59 I just spilt tanning oil all over my Apple MacBook keyboard. COOL

3529 2018-06-26 17:33:37 I admire the go for it all attitude RT @TheyCallMeNap: “Can I oil you up?” as the opening to your DM is extremely wild lol
3530 2018-06-26 17:33:36 I’m just trying to pay for my oil change and these mfs are having a 10min long heart to heart about names  I have to GOOOOOO
3531 2018-06-26 17:33:35 It doesn’t “fade” my dark spots but it helps a lot with my dry skin patches. Grapeseed oil is good for evening your skin tone and moisture
3532 2018-06-26 17:33:26 We need more tariffs. Donald should tariffs Canadian oil, our gold ,weed and maple syrup. Our budget surplus would go ballistic.
3533 2018-06-26 17:33:21 I soaked my nails in olive oil and now my whole life is better
3534 2018-06-26 17:33:21 I grew up living under the flight path of concord, people have to decide what is most important to them, in city near an airport or further out where public transport isn’t as good, if they run out of oil in 50 years things could change again
3535 2018-06-26 17:33:17 Oil diffusing>>>
3536 2018-06-26 17:33:08 Indeed. When I'm in County Hall amid the marble statues of naked wrestling and oil paintings in big gilt frames of Lord Lieutenants of yesteryear, I'm stuck by just how modern and forward looking we are.
3537 2018-06-26 17:33:06 How do you store your bacon fat? Do you just spoon it out and put it in an air tight container directly into the fridge? Or can it be stored like olive oil?
3538 2018-06-26 17:33:02 Yes, you're quite correct, they make it all workable for oil co's to make billions in profits while destroying all they come in contact with. The clean up alone from the tar sands is estimated to cost more than all the revenues generated from it. My or my, what sound business.

3540 2018-06-26 17:32:36 Did Rudy Giuliani mastermind the massive oil privatization deal in the Trump Russia Dossier?
This factual report reveals the full extent of his Russian connections, and proves that his Kremlin relationships have reached directly to Vladimir Putin for a long time.
3541 2018-06-26 17:32:29 Jill Stein and Bernie Sanders “conscience voters” helped gut our EPA. Trump reinstated pesticides linked to brain damage, oil and gas rigs are dumping toxins in the gulf (he’s auctioning off 77M acres in August), pristine land has been pillaged...but her emails. #gosuckatailpipe

3543 2018-06-26 17:32:15 Falsehoods.  Dissemination of misinformation.  I would say look it up or google but your purpose is to spread what is not true.  Like tweets from Trump.  Peddling snake oil.
3544 2018-06-26 17:32:06 Never getting my oil changed at @jiffylube again. 90 dollars for the oil change, only for them to double up my gasket and now all of my engine oil has leaked out on my driveway leaving stains. Took my mechanic two mins to figure out thankfully.
3545 2018-06-26 17:32:03 Hi there , does coconut oil really darken skin ?? And thanks
3546 2018-06-26 17:31:53 Coconut oil is the plug...I wish I had before pictures to show you...
3547 2018-06-26 17:31:53 Dides that sell beard oil talking about it’ll help u grow one are just like women with fake bodies telling ppl it’s gym. Debate with your dog
3548 2018-06-26 17:31:50 I really shouldn’t have put this castor oil in my hair before work. I hate the smell
3549 2018-06-26 17:31:40 Countries are being told they face sanctions if they buy #oil from #Iran, does that mean all global citizens now get a vote in US elections?
3550 2018-06-26 17:30:59 Looking to enhance your brain function and improve memory?  A Mediterranean diet group supplemented with extra virgin olive oil and mixed nuts might help with better cognitive function.
3551 2018-06-26 17:30:58 Good.  I buy CBD oil for my elderly dog’s arthritis— 100 bucks for a small bottle.  She lost a profitable business.
3552 2018-06-26 17:30:56 the more salacious, the better
3553 2018-06-26 17:30:55 Subsistence farming is hard sometimes. Right now, I really want Frosted Flakes. But I don’t have them. I have turnips, eggs, peas, carrots. I have rice. I have chilis in oil, Thai basil, garlic, ginger.

3557 2018-06-26 17:30:44 Car Industry isn't subsidized? Or oil and natural gas?
3558 2018-06-26 17:30:42 Hmmm... you still need some sort of hard currency to buy oil and medicines. And you need government to mobilize resources to build roads, schools, and things that lower costs of living and foster commerce.
3559 2018-06-26 17:30:42 I was just saying how I need an oil diffuser, and then an Amazon package for my mom came and there was literally one in there.
3560 2018-06-26 17:30:39 March on Mr.PRESIDENT #MAGA sad to see @harleydavidson leak this way, but they have always been notorious for leaking . Just wouldn’t expect it to go from oil to AMERICAN PRIDE!!!

3569 2018-06-26 17:29:56 I think Mr. Harris needs to use slightly less phosphates in his snake oil.

3571 2018-06-26 17:29:47 You wish. Oil ain’t invoke again! Human capital is the new Oil of the modern world. How well are YOU doing in that area? Meanwhile ask your governor the states that constitutes NDDC if you so insist that south east don’t have Oil. May jealousy don’t get the better part of you.
3572 2018-06-26 17:29:46 We can make all the oil we need... but can Canada make all the batteries it needs?

3574 2018-06-26 17:29:25 BREAKING: 
The Trump administration says all countries must stop buying Iranian oil by November 4 or they will be subject to US sanctions. This includes their closest allies.

3576 2018-06-26 17:29:19 Blending emulsifies the butter into the coffee and prevents any oil slick
3577 2018-06-26 17:29:14 It's quite a different set of legal arguments beyond just the parameters of executive power. But more so I'm confident conservative judges won't bite because conservatives with power (oil/gas lobby, Kochs) won't want them to
3578 2018-06-26 17:29:03 What’s it like mate I only liked the green one til I see a mechanic clean oil an shit of a metal desk with a can of it

3580 2018-06-26 17:28:54 So many people in Nigeria live in poverty despite the country's significant oil production and reserves because of corruption, which puts the oil wealth in the hand of a few people at the expense of the general public. I'm so unhappy about this report. We're the biggest economy!
3581 2018-06-26 17:28:50 I’m the greasiest person I know! On any given day I’m LATHERED in baby oil looking like a buttered baked potato
3582 2018-06-26 17:28:47 Pakistan fell victim to the  regime change policy of USA that  made heavy  investment in OIL in Saudi Arabia and Middle East. Saudi Arabia  prevailed .Just TRADE overpowered the  region before threat of  Communism perceived. OIC was  not formed.??

3584 2018-06-26 17:28:37 @ElizabethMay   I am so proud of you  you tell it like it is, our clean country is under attack from world wide polluters, Can't we just build processing plants in the muck that is the oil sands?  at least refined petroleum is easier to clean up!
3585 2018-06-26 17:28:19 I don’t know. I have my air conditioner running 24/7 and I’ve been too busy pouring motor oil down the drain to go outside and check.

3598 2018-06-26 17:26:01 No, not if #SaudiArabia steps up to the plate like they announced today. As well the US has to stop shipping oil from its #Permian basin offshore. The producers would like us to believe there will be a shortage. #usoil #uspoli
3599 2018-06-26 17:25:58 It's now under the umbrella of manipulation that other assets have fallen prey too. We've had this discussion but when looking into the contracts traded per day on Silver equate to year and a half of global production, where as oil is 5 days worth.not even close when compared
3600 2018-06-26 17:25:54 I use this one from time to time. RT @TheyCallMeNap: "Can I oil you up?" as the opening to your DM is extremely wild lol

3609 2018-06-26 17:25:00 Charles and David Koch, the fantastically rich fossil fuel barons owning the empire father Fred founded building oil refineries for Stalin and Hitler.

3622 2018-06-26 17:23:11 Season your cast iron often, don't wash with soap, use the right kind of oil after you clean it. The higher smoke point on the oil you use to season, the more non-stick it becomes. After I scrape mine out and dry it on the stove, I use flaxseed oil and wipe it down.

3628 2018-06-26 17:22:33 Today is my last day of Whole30.   Zipped past in blink of eye.  Good luck.  I bought ghee and never opened.  Used coconut oil.
3629 2018-06-26 17:22:32 Weird at first. It definitely tastes lightly like coconut oil, which i like. It's very smooth and coats your mouth. The caffeine is powerful. 8/10 I'd absolutely get it again

3645 2018-06-26 17:20:54 You should consider leaving the cult of Bernard. He got crushed by 3.8 million votes and over 12% nationally in the primary and couldn’t even convince his long time co-workers in the progressive caucus to back his magic fast change revolution snake oil farce of a campaign.
3646 2018-06-26 17:20:52 @kanyewest @KimKardashian @DondaCreate - If you want to transport oil, you need a pipeline, If you want to transport  cars, you need a cargo ship or plane, & if you want to transport illegal drugs, you need to bribe the cops or avoid them altogether.
It's the same concept.

3656 2018-06-26 17:20:06 Unlike Piers Morgan, I remember 1973. We had an oil crisis, rising unemployment, a 3 day week and regular power cuts. We were the 'Sick man of Europe'. It was shite.
3657 2018-06-26 17:20:00 Yeah, I deal with such disparate areas in the department... Environmental protection is everything from recycling to air pollution to oil spills... Animal health is stray dogs and horses to livestock... Conservation officers is bears and hunting regulations and wildlife...

3661 2018-06-26 17:19:50 We bought the pipeline so we can ship our oil products everywhere else except 'Merica.

3669 2018-06-26 17:18:54 Just ask people in MA what they think of Romney! Do yourselves a favor do not vote for this snake oil salesman!
3670 2018-06-26 17:18:33 We have always believed the oil we "NEVER" finish and naija will never be poor. So they (everybody) are allowed to thief as much as they like.

Guess what? E don finish oo. And we have made records. No matter how negative its still a record.

Just too bad.

3672 2018-06-26 17:18:24 Often the companies that have the largest morality issues are those who have a public/private sector relationship and are in bed with government. Which is anti free markets as well. gas, oil, pharma, etc gain power due to non free market relations with overly powerful government.

3703 2018-06-26 17:14:51 Strongly recommend dollar tree. 24 oz brown rice, 12 Oz peanuts, 5 Oz country ham, loaf bread, 8 oz peanut butter, 12 oz pancake mix, 8 eggs each a $. Grocery store bananas, cooking oil. That & multivitamin every other day gets you to about 90 $ add apples & onions = just enough
3704 2018-06-26 17:14:41 Can you sort out that leader of yours spending all that money on an oil pipe line. What a waste

3706 2018-06-26 17:14:26 Couldn’t sleep so I woke up at 7, sat in Walmart for an hour and a half waiting for an oil change, went to Panera (they forgot my baguette), come home, have to restart my WiFi from the rain, and THEN my power goes out. And it’s only noon!!!! #whatistoday?
3707 2018-06-26 17:14:23 Not sure. But epidolex will cost $700-1000 a month and an LP CBD oil of same concentration would cost $90. Are we really going to pay 10x because it comes in a spray bottle. Seems like waste of $$

3722 2018-06-26 17:13:04 Good thinking, Adam. Oil’s rally looks forced. Likely to fade barring monster draws from EIA. Wti is above $70 and most energy stocks not moving much. MMs are skeptical too.
3723 2018-06-26 17:12:45 If the West should have nothing to do with Africa, then we should stop exploiting their oil and gold and cobalt and diomands, stop funding their warlords, stop toppling their uncooperative goverments...

3731 2018-06-26 17:11:42 I would point out that nearly all polls now suggest a majority to stay. The alternative to the final deal can only be to stay because it is the best deal the government can get and leaving without any deal is madness. Those who buy snake oil do not end up happy.
3732 2018-06-26 17:11:39 he said that waging a war in Iraq to secure imperial control over Iraq's oil resources was "some of that war's more positive consequences" and that US corporations didn't get a good deal (very Trumpian) on the bidding. the US controls 20% of Iraqi oil refineries

3734 2018-06-26 17:11:31 Sadly, this is not surprising to me. Oil has only brought the country more harm than good. They don't see much of the profits as their leaders line their pockets all while their environment suffers from widespread illegal refining.

3741 2018-06-26 17:10:46 I urge the Minnesota puc to approve the Enbridge line 3 it is alot more safe to transport the oil underground than on railroad tracks and by semi so therefore please approve the line thank you
3742 2018-06-26 17:10:40 Agreed we also must reduce overconsumption & waste along the supply chain. But palm oil is in about half of all packaged products sold in the supermarket so would be pretty hard to avoid completely.
3743 2018-06-26 17:10:40 If Bashir is really for a genuine peace for South Sudan then he shouldn't lure Kiir-Riek into giving up our Oil Fields to SAF to protect them. When peace comes for sure, there would be no point of Khartoum offering security to our Oil sector unless he's preempting another new war

3750 2018-06-26 17:10:19 @2AvSagas Now that courts have found that SF and Oakland cannot sue oil companies over climate change, how will @NYCMayor fake his concern for climate change?
3751 2018-06-26 17:10:16 I live and work among these people.  The meltdown is real and awesome to watch in person.   Bless their hearts but they have no idea that they are sowing into their own demise.
3752 2018-06-26 17:10:11 Yes. We will stop just short of kinetic war with Russia. Reinstate full export controls. A $70,000 car from EU or Japan will cost $150k. No computers. No oil technology. We will create basis for civil war in Russia so they eliminate the Oligarch class. 1918 all over again.

3755 2018-06-26 17:10:05 nooooooooooooo... the Great Sand Dunes is one of the most beautiful parks I have ever been and a little known park... I am shocked and disheartened by possible oil drilling
3756 2018-06-26 17:10:04 Yes,on my left leg-My brother o ntshetse ka hot oil.
On my left cheek-the removal of tumour.
3757 2018-06-26 17:10:03 I bought a used Honda Shadow 750 last year and put 3,000 miles on it that summer. Even though it's already 15 years old, all it needed so far was an oil change and a chain adjustment - both standard seasonal maintenance. Great bike, very reliable. I highly recommend it.
3758 2018-06-26 17:10:03 can someone explain to me why my lips got chapped all of a sudden and how olive oil isn’t working its magic
3759 2018-06-26 17:09:59 Waiting for my oil change outside and this white lady told her son to sit by me. She didn’t want her shield to sit next to 2 African American men. Little does she know I am the worse influence and I’m going to teach her kid about drugz.
3760 2018-06-26 17:09:59 2 funny things I discovered at work today:

1. In oil and gas, there is something called Dirty Department 

2. There is an oil vessel named DS VIDA 
3761 2018-06-26 17:09:58 Contrary to what Honor the Earth just said at MNPUC, “Grain elevators and farmers in Minnesota want this oil to move safely down the preferred route for the Line 3 Replacement and keep the rail cars available for our commodities.” Bob Zelenka MGFA. #line3

WTI has spiked sharply higher, rising above $70 for the first time since May 25, following news the US will press allies to cut Iran oil imports to zero by November 4.
3770 2018-06-26 17:09:27 Kampala Area.

You can pick your Virgin Gold sunflower cooking oil from here.
3771 2018-06-26 17:09:27 Luckily South Africa is no longer a big importer of Iranian oil? So SA doesn’t face a big threat from potential US sanctions
3772 2018-06-26 17:09:25 To please the Saudis or to make Oil more expensive. We never goin to betray Persia.
3773 2018-06-26 17:09:24 remember to salt the water before adding your pasta

3780 2018-06-26 17:09:00 The first Gulf War was terrible, with the burning oil Wells and pit toilet burning.

3789 2018-06-26 17:08:06 Bread and herb-fused olive oil at the Red Hen, and I’m sure “it” will revive circuses. Good way for the severely disabled to earn a living ;-)
3790 2018-06-26 17:07:59 There is some cannabis oil that has no THC that is used for dogs for medical reasons but I would think you would need a permit to sell it?
3791 2018-06-26 17:07:47 im so bored, im taking my moms car to get an inspection & oil change for her.
3792 2018-06-26 17:07:45 Fuck, Anno 2070 is heavy handed with the lessons it teaches you. Despite the ecoterrorist type guy keeping on telling me to join him and attack the polluting oil guy, I tolerated the polluter while he wasn't being belligerent, while keeping my own islands nice and unpolluted.
3793 2018-06-26 17:07:30 I'm baffled by people who deny climate change. Not by billionaire oil tycoons, (I can see what they stand to lose if climate change becomes undeniable fact) but the common everyman climate change denialist? What do they stand to lose?
3794 2018-06-26 17:07:15 Earth temps are in cycles. Man made intervention doesn't exist
3795 2018-06-26 17:07:10 no... that is a 30 year practice... called trickle down economics, reaganomics, whatever you want to call it.. how has that worked for you..? Oil non sustainable, deregulations are GOPs way of convincing you that you don't need consumer protections, ... so Nope.. no ideas

3798 2018-06-26 17:06:43 Iran can't pay its bills with barter. State employees won't accept bartered goods in place of salary. Iran's currency crisis will balloon if they try to do this. It might work for a small portion of the crude oil China buys from them but its not a solution
3799 2018-06-26 17:06:37 K,since you find all she's doing owk
3800 2018-06-26 17:06:27 We don't need to be tying anything to oil, we need to be doing everything we can to move away from oil. What we really need is to stop outsourcing and contracting everything so that regulators aren't  in a de facto conflict of interest.
3801 2018-06-26 17:06:24 Na so.. Red oil fall on you..
3802 2018-06-26 17:06:23 That's a very very long way away
As an American you're aware how much your country's economy is reliant on oil, and you have a President who doesn't believe in man made climate change
My forcing veganism on my dog is hardly going to help
3803 2018-06-26 17:06:20 Mitch McConnell is an unspeakable. But when he is in the cell next to Trump he will be on the way to getting what he deserves. Like Yertle the Turtle it will all come tumbling down in the end and history will remember him for enabler that he is owned by the Koch's and big oil.

3808 2018-06-26 17:05:57 Absolutely HATE going to get my oil changed... these little 16 year old boys try to talk me into buying EVERYTHING
3809 2018-06-26 17:05:54 I looked outside the window to see if Siaty was there, I didn't see her, but I opened the door, and there she was. Kitty by the door. I opened a fancy feast for her but she just licked the packing oil off of it. I don't know how to feed this finicky feline sometimes
3810 2018-06-26 17:05:46 Lool I follow her well. I'm saying how is what she's done silly. She stands for what she believes in and she's bold. How is that silly? That's all I'm asking.
3811 2018-06-26 17:05:39 I'm getting my oil changed idk y ppl working on my car makes me nervous 
3812 2018-06-26 17:05:28 Lol ,isn't that a smart move,so we can all go on vacation after d match
3813 2018-06-26 17:05:20 Yes I have. Calf massages are great. But having someone’s hands slipping on and throughout my foot and my toes with oil and all is just the most uncomfortable feeling of all time.
3814 2018-06-26 17:05:17 China has become a much more oil consumer than the US. And today they have become the largest crude importer.

3817 2018-06-26 17:04:39 There is nothing wrong with being cautious, that is what experience and knowledge provide to you, if you are smart to  recognize your failures and find a different approach.Bernie’s ideas are the snake oil salesman (45s on right) version of the left. Great sound bite though.
3818 2018-06-26 17:04:36 and a little extra virgin olive oil?
3819 2018-06-26 17:04:34 Radiculous surge, like the US depends on that oil when it’s pumping 11mbd
3820 2018-06-26 17:04:32 lol.. Abeg which kind of oil?
3821 2018-06-26 17:04:20 Coconut Oil
3822 2018-06-26 17:04:18 You just need to look south and you'll see a strong national army. We don't even have your oil billions. Should be a walk in the park for you.
3823 2018-06-26 17:04:18 2/"jobs" the remaining areas of this market were already a steady favorable increase prior to Trump. The construction growth has to do with the oil rig building increases. Also initiated under prior admin.  Add to that the freight/transport industry tarrif war disasters looming.
3824 2018-06-26 17:04:17 barter is one. China could get oil from Iran at a better price than current inflated rates.  China is much closer to Iran than any other oil market.
Iran would benefit from the huge  market of China goods.  Once oil drops to the 50s I could see this as no longer an option.
3825 2018-06-26 17:04:11 Hello, Canada?
Please do the world, especially the United States, a HUGE favor and stop sending us your tar sands oil.  Shut down the pipelines.  Halt the ships.
You're looking for a way to get back at Trump.  And I don't blame you.
This would really get his goat!
3826 2018-06-26 17:04:08 “You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.”

3828 2018-06-26 17:04:03 It is not the Ministry which raises or lowers prices, but by oil companies based on formula linked to international prices. Yes Govt. can subsidise! And how do we meet the shortfall? Print more notes? Then also prices rise & Inflation back, or curtail development expenditure !!!
3829 2018-06-26 17:03:57 That is the thought process that my mind cannot wrap around~
Humans are fleeing  the conflicts that we created b/c of oil, cocaine, & religious but they believe the misconception that refugee immigrants are coming to Europe & America b/c we are handing out homes & cash.
3830 2018-06-26 17:03:46 We could do it without that, if the government would stop taking money from the oil industry and actually do what is right.
3831 2018-06-26 17:03:46 Oil refineries are literally surrounded by storages and lakes with a black mass polluting the planet's surface.
Let's save the world together!

3839 2018-06-26 17:03:14 That was very tragic but once again like many of you anti Oil/Gas people are very wrong. An old Gas well production line was hit when the excavator was digging for a foundation. He then buried it and didn't tell anyone. Not the OG Company's fault.

3841 2018-06-26 17:03:01 With US sanctions looming after Prez Trump withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear deal, the Trump Admin is now telling US allies they must no longer import any Iranian oil by November. That's according to a senior State Dept official.

3846 2018-06-26 17:02:29 Yea that's was my first thought was when I saw it bent and it lost much oil .
It's 16 yrs old. Got my moneys worth if it is toast.
3847 2018-06-26 17:02:29 You do realise that the economy is like an oil tanker. It takes a long time to turn. The economy you are experiencing is all from Obama. Wait till effects of rump's tariff war come into effect. You know Harley-Davidson is moving some production offshore because of the tariff war?
3848 2018-06-26 17:02:13 BEST PLACE FOR OIL CHANGE? AND GO!
3849 2018-06-26 17:02:07 Not liking this point.  Stocks and oil ignoring $DXY, aligned with USD/JPY.  Need DXY to sell off before we jump back in.

3856 2018-06-26 17:01:42 (And Saudi Arabia didn't pay anyone off. They have oil, they're an "ally" of the States, Trump does business with them, so no one in government cares about the horrific life many of their citizens - particularly women - live.)
3857 2018-06-26 17:01:33 I’d kill a toasted bagel wit some olive oil on it right now.

It has been reported that Uganda will not meet the deadline of 2020 for first oil production. Is this a good thing or bad thing?
3878 2018-06-26 16:59:53 It's amazing all the way from @ScrubbyOak in Norfolk... have you used it before @KarenWhiteFood ? ? I love to mix with Whole grain Mustard and Finely Chopped Mint and a drop of @CrushFoods Cold Pressed Rapeseed Oil And marinate Lamb for Sunday lunch..x
3879 2018-06-26 16:59:28 .@Onnit Why in your Joint Oil do you not use Krill oil but fish oil, when you have krill oil as a supplement and deem it better?
3880 2018-06-26 16:59:24 Crude buyers must cut all Iranian oil imports by November, U.S. says
3881 2018-06-26 16:59:07 Rotini pasta with some olive oil garlic and this mix of sesame seeds and seaweed flakes and stuff and the tiniest bit of balsamic. It wasn’t bad ??
3882 2018-06-26 16:59:07  @Argentina Watch this
3883 2018-06-26 16:59:00 The #Trump administration is pushing US allies to cut their #oil imports from #Iran to zero by November.

3885 2018-06-26 16:58:55 I have my son change it for me now. Before that, I paid someone to change my oil when I got my 1st mini-van. Nursing or pregnant under the vehicle...hard pass!
3886 2018-06-26 16:58:54 It is hot to walk, LOL  but had to drop off the car for the inspection sticker , oil change, look at the
 squeaky brake's. 
Here goes more MONEY !

3888 2018-06-26 16:58:46 Why does an oil change at @Walmart take 3 hours? Someone explain.
3889 2018-06-26 16:58:44 The use of lavender incense burning or heating lavender oil will help that. But it can't all be cleared that way. That's just the first task. See my pinned tweet for more info
3890 2018-06-26 16:58:44 I take a Hair, Skin & Nail 3x day, Luten for my eyes, Omega 3 Fish Oil & Glucosamine.  I have them in my Reminder to take throughout the day.  I also take Blood Pressure medication so I have to take to my dr about taking things.
3891 2018-06-26 16:58:42 Venezuela? Wonder why? We keep buying oil from them.
3892 2018-06-26 16:58:36 I think it is like blood and oil the Don Johnson show
3893 2018-06-26 16:58:30 Will she give me money
3894 2018-06-26 16:58:26 That’s because Germany hasnt done anything helpful with it’s military. The last time it was active was when Auschwitz was open. Yet you criticize US for our military actions. Saying we went to the Middle East for oil is like saying the Berlin Airlift was for profit. NONSENSE!
3895 2018-06-26 16:58:24 Locals only: (Martinsville, Mooresville, Indy and surrounding areas, Bedford) Who needs to order some CBD oil? END OF MONTH LAST CALL!
3896 2018-06-26 16:58:24 I found the way to do this online.  Using high heat (I usually 8 on the stove), put oil in cold pan, put chicken in. Cover for 10 to 15 minutes, turn and cover again for 10 to 15 minutes.  Just don't take the lid off other than to turn it.
3897 2018-06-26 16:58:24 You can use 3 drops of lavender oil in coconut oil or cocoa butter...apply to area 3 times a day....or apply bentonite clay to area....let sit for 2 hours before rinsing off....hope either one helps....aloe Vera also helps soothe area
3898 2018-06-26 16:58:20 If the RNC doesnt make campaign ads out of every single one of these tweets, they are hopelessly clueless. Just make still shots of each of them for a few seconds.
3899 2018-06-26 16:58:15 They got oil
3900 2018-06-26 16:58:14 If expanded #TransMountain gets 99.999% of product to destination without incident, it will leak 516,511 litres of oil per year!

Just 1 litre of oil can contaminate 1 million litres of water.
B.C. ecosystems, salmon, etc, are precious & irreplaceable.
No FN consent, no pipeline.

3904 2018-06-26 16:58:03 Call on OPEC to increase supply could rise as a result of shortfalls in Iranian,  Libyan and Venezuelan oil supply shortfalls. Will OPEC be able to meet the call?, IEA oil head. #commoditiesSoiree

3906 2018-06-26 16:57:48 $TSLA about to start correlating with crude oil and gas prices again... In other words oil up = $TSLA up

3911 2018-06-26 16:57:28 I do love olive oil!!
3912 2018-06-26 16:57:25 How can be this possible for a country like India ...who is importing huge amount of oil from Iran....
3913 2018-06-26 16:56:51 "U cant talk slick to a can of oil".....i cant wait for the 12 12 skinnies
3914 2018-06-26 16:56:49 And I’m stealing this. Thank you
3915 2018-06-26 16:56:46 Your opinion
3916 2018-06-26 16:56:43 Btw since Msia is humid and muka cpt berminyak, jgn tepek banyak2 oil tu. Usually lepas cuci muka, i use toner and while lembab lagi aku terus letak a couple drops (1-2 pun boleh) of oil so senang spread. Add more kalau rasa tak ckup. And blot it before makeup etc
3917 2018-06-26 16:56:40 They've all sold out... OIL $$
3918 2018-06-26 16:56:30 Gas to make electricity...Not from the likes of @bulbenergy you don't!

Oil for the engine...in an electric car!

3925 2018-06-26 16:55:53 Only move he could make. Why should East hand over oil,  proceeds of which are used to kill its young men and line others' pockets. East has lost too many citizens in West's quest to subdue it.
3926 2018-06-26 16:55:53 Palm oil
3927 2018-06-26 16:55:52 Okay very quickly. Why is his mum silly? Because I've not seen anything that she's done that would make her silly.
3928 2018-06-26 16:55:44 Glad your so happy you LIED to Kim Y U that U would open up his country to Travel/Trade, an just as he stopped testing u lied to him a put a Travel Ban against HIM And His Country! Same with Iran/Saudi came to a Production agreement on Oil, u put a Ban on Iran! Dumb A##
3929 2018-06-26 16:55:37 Vacationing in the Caribbean staying in nice hotels is my type of camping.  Three unexpected items:  Eating utensils, can/bottle opener & KY or baby oil.
3930 2018-06-26 16:55:37 i freaking slam tea tree oil and then acne cream on my acne for the third time for tonight
3931 2018-06-26 16:55:28 There is likely shortfall in oil supply from Venezuela, Iran (as a result of sanctions) and Libya, IEA oil head. Saudi Arabia, Rushia etc may need to fill that shortfall.
#commoditiesSoiree
3932 2018-06-26 16:55:21 Let’s invade and take their oil! Use proceeds to restore them and a bounty for us to pay for the military cost and to decrease our deficit. It would be appreciated and an easy operation. Justification? Monroe Doctrine
3933 2018-06-26 16:55:20 How can I kidnap my in law,I'm taking her to the embassy to renew her visa to while away time.
3934 2018-06-26 16:55:09 Great...forget oil and gasoline.
3935 2018-06-26 16:55:02 PUC asks #Enbridge whether they would agree to a new #Line3 that pumped only 500K barrels of #oil per day? Rather than 760K? Enbridge says no, because that would still result in "apportionment" on the pipeline...i.e. more demand than there is space on the pipeline.
3936 2018-06-26 16:55:01 When black Women put that oil on they skin and sit pool side 
3937 2018-06-26 16:54:54 They are all just trash...and as #Scots we should drag the fyckers out of our parliament and straight down to the #Grassmarket .....dregs of society, thieves 22 oil paintings, expense corruption, xenophobic porcine onanists.....
3938 2018-06-26 16:54:49 อยากลอง vivid oil tint ด้วย พอรีวิวเล็กๆให้หน่อยได้ไหมคะว่าเป็นแบบไหน แฮะๆ เห็นมันแปลกๆดี แต่สีสวย
3939 2018-06-26 16:54:47 Most are false claims of asylum, I think it was somewhere around 80% if I remember correctly. Most come here for work, we sustain Mexico's economy that way even more so than their biggest export, oil. Its a major tranfer of America's wealth. Yet we can't feed our own hungry kids.
3940 2018-06-26 16:54:42 good point, i hate hybrid cars, because the oil dicks still got some profit in them
3941 2018-06-26 16:54:22 The report, and other EDF work, indicates that most fugitive emissions are result of poorly maintained, or failed, equipment. This is not a necessary element of petroleum production. 

I totally agree we should be produce less oil and gas, but fracking is only part of the issue.
3942 2018-06-26 16:54:21 The guy was not serious, he should go n Talk his silly mum some sense
3943 2018-06-26 16:54:19 Better get the Hawiian Tropic oil out.
3944 2018-06-26 16:54:13 Oil on the fire. Like it was needed.... :(
3945 2018-06-26 16:54:06 We looked at fish oil in 2003. n> 200 (Double blind, placebo control) adolescents in 2003. IQ, IT, 5FM, reading, depression, schizotypy. Only significant outcomes (marginal) showed evidence of harm, not benefit…). Failed to publish it  <- part of the problem
3946 2018-06-26 16:54:05 You should meet my mum
3947 2018-06-26 16:54:03 There goes the North Korea Deal that Trump "PROMISED" Kim Y U he'd open his country up to trade/travel & as soon as he stop's testing Trump put's a Travel Ban on his country through the Supreme Ct. Saudi/Iran oil deal with us just went south as well, Iran on that Travel Ban too!
3948 2018-06-26 16:54:00 i need to oil my ears
3949 2018-06-26 16:53:58 I will do my best. But, the new administration is sympathetic to your cause. They already increased sanctions to inhibit oil sales.
3950 2018-06-26 16:53:53 En oil&gas es similar, la comunidades son informadas, pero no entienden nada ni ellos ni sus asesores. Al final te piden dinero y si haces obras por impuestos se meten en todo y no se hace nada. Falta presencia del estado y que les den servicios basicos y casas con las regalías.
3951 2018-06-26 16:53:48 burbon(sic) and gun oil? more like "begging for daddy's approval"
3952 2018-06-26 16:53:42 *U.S. hears oil*

*U.S. gets aroused*
3953 2018-06-26 16:53:41 Me voy a gastar los 2litros de gas oil y esta inmundicia no va a prender 
3954 2018-06-26 16:53:33 This is going to sound bizarre in the Keto world - but I do not like my coffee greasy.  I just can’t do the bullet proof way with oil or butter.  Even blended.  It’s weird!
3955 2018-06-26 16:53:31 Went and had my oil changed this morning and my mama gave me a discount 
3956 2018-06-26 16:53:29 Bebi oil kan buat bayi?
3957 2018-06-26 16:53:29 Not silicone oil? ;P
3958 2018-06-26 16:53:21 My dude Antoni on Queer Eye mixed sesame oil into his spicy mayo ('racha and mayo) and that shit's cash. I like to use a little bit of tabasco style sauce in my spicy mayo.
3959 2018-06-26 16:53:18 Use virgin coconut oil 
3960 2018-06-26 16:53:02 These are the vital ingredients and the rest is all about frying the tilapia in little oil until its half done, slicing the onion into tiny cubes, adding your spices and mashing them together & let it cook till the onions are done. Then wrap them into the Goya wraps & fry. Done!
3961 2018-06-26 16:52:55 I'd like to say if they had crude oil they wouldn't do what they 're doing but reality is if they had crude oil they would still want to enslave us all. Nigerians need to unite against this tyranny.
3962 2018-06-26 16:52:48 Libya has become a place that we should begin to flag with supply risks, head of oil of IEA. #commoditiesSoiree
3963 2018-06-26 16:52:42 Every time I get my oil changed the guys here always hit it on me  it’s the ego boost I needed today lol
3964 2018-06-26 16:52:26 I always love that about brexit, we just ignore our principles. Well, now dictators and extreme isolationists are the only ones we've got left to trade with (the EU already has agreements for us with many places). I for one love blood in my oil.

3969 2018-06-26 16:51:51 I drink Guinness and Shiner Bock....Why doesn't Trump point to Russia to prohibit entry into the US.  Our major enemy in the world is the Russian Kleptocracy & the Putinista's. Poor Russia...with all that oil, etc., and can barely compete with tiny Italy economically!
3970 2018-06-26 16:51:50 Did the coconut oil & ginger wrap, now bout to try & get a decent work out in lol.
3971 2018-06-26 16:51:48 It’s only eggs and oil if you think about it!
3972 2018-06-26 16:51:34 Wow. Pretty soon Americans will be trading with themselves, powered by oil and coal in a land where abortion is illegal. Welcome to the 19th century.

3975 2018-06-26 16:51:19 @jiffylube one of your locations put the wrong oil in my car and voided my warranty . How do you plan to rectify this?
3976 2018-06-26 16:51:19 No I was actually referring to you. Why would you say someone's mum has "zero integrity body"(whatever that means)? It's his mum that you're talking about like that why won't he say you're silly? His insult is justified.

3981 2018-06-26 16:51:11 Pure capitalism leads to monopolies which are just corporate dictatorships. Look at Standard Oil and Carnegie Steel. No labor laws. No safety laws. You have 10 year olds working 12 hour shifts in steel mills. Yay unregulated capitalism!

3984 2018-06-26 16:51:01 Yes! I can’t wait til my summer solstice oil arrive! My next purchase will definitely be the Yemaya aura spray 
3985 2018-06-26 16:50:57 really? how? 
pay in renminbi? what's Iran going to do with renminbi!
set up a bank in Iran that doesn't do business with any US entity?
who is going to insure these tankers of oil?
It's not as easy as it sounds and China may find a much simpler solution - buy oil from elsewhere
3986 2018-06-26 16:50:50 Adam does as well.. I’ve made him a salve of aloe, coconut oil & peppermint EO— it has done him wonders
3987 2018-06-26 16:50:44 @realDonaldTrump wanting lower oil price is likely a fake news. Oil heading to $100 due to mis-managed sanctions

3992 2018-06-26 16:50:24 Kalau bekas jerawat, coba pake masker bawang.

Pedih banget sih, tapi kulit kamu bakal kering, trus ngelupas, kayak di peeling.

Atau enggak pake bio oil, buat ngilangin bekas luka sih, tapi katanya juga bisa buat bekas jerawat
3993 2018-06-26 16:50:23 It's hard for people to buy this. Fight fire with fire is often used as the comeback, but only works in oil/gas fires. WATER/slow down of combustion is how you fight large wild fires. COOL HEADS/civility is how we fight this non-civil/HOT-HEADED mob. Anger ignites/POWER sustains.
3994 2018-06-26 16:50:20 First job I ever had was working at the Madison theatre (RIP) - when the boss wasn't looking (hey, Mr. Youssef!) we at concession would make triple triples (three hits of oil and three of yellow salt (instead of the usual one each). The popcorn GLOWED. Radioactive deliciousness.

3997 2018-06-26 16:50:05 was planning on getting my oil changed but it’s cloudy??? guess I’ll see what’s happening at the White House
3998 2018-06-26 16:50:01 Jamie which is the brand of oil paint that you use for the canvas?
3999 2018-06-26 16:49:57 Although our members are best known for their wine, you can find other gourmet items on our trail too. Graveyard Vineyards makes family secret recipe spice rubs, Ranchita Canyon Vineyard produces estate olive oil, and at Hartley Farms you will find some decadent jams!
4000 2018-06-26 16:49:51 When refineries make oil processing, they generate a large amount of  waste. Our PRT-2 plant can refine all that waste to different types of  fuel. It can be gaskerosene, gasoline and etc.  Our project will make  the world cleaner! #papusha #ico #PRT #presale #pollution #ecology
4001 2018-06-26 16:49:44 Funny how Venezuela's oil is good but not our people. Keep making Friends, americans.
4002 2018-06-26 16:49:39 none of them have a grenedian granny who fav meal is either buljol, green fig and olive oil. herring, green fig and olive oil... maybe some pepper. lol they ain know ntn bout culture man.
4003 2018-06-26 16:49:38 I hope it does...Trump just put a order against Iran & their oil...they are already unable to supply the people so hopefully they will be ran out of the country soon
4004 2018-06-26 16:49:32 When I’m getting too overheated and sweaty at work, my makeup either becomes a greasy oil slick or actually crusts on my face and I can’t find a middle ground anywhere so let’s see how today goes!
4005 2018-06-26 16:49:23 For their safety women should flee to mexico in this case according to stupid liberal cbs
4006 2018-06-26 16:49:22 The November Iranian export sanction dead line is another sharp instrument to increase oil price. All is about control of energy.  Cheating, wars, price control and sanctions are the instrument.

4010 2018-06-26 16:49:03 Well if you want to innovate it will have to be in oil & gas, engineering, architecture, agriculture or real estate.
4011 2018-06-26 16:48:54 I was talking about his brain not his looks. Is that ok?
4012 2018-06-26 16:48:54 I still don't understand. Why would there be no incentive to restock? I think I might have been wrong to say that oil production would increase if the price of oil went up because less people would be buying the oil.
4013 2018-06-26 16:48:26 Move. Or stop lying. You have literally broken the odds of bad luck.
4014 2018-06-26 16:48:22 #Iraq|PM #Abadi: The increase in #oil prices above the current levels could lead to crude price collapse
4015 2018-06-26 16:48:10 Very bad mistake made by #Trump on #Iran. He is obtaining higher oil prices and a big Russia-China-Iran axis. #OOTT

4018 2018-06-26 16:47:58 the main part of the dish was oumph (a kind of "soy meat" that I'm told is kinda chicken-y") fried in chili oil infused with a ton of garlic and herbs and chili flakes to get some nice color, then letting it simmer in vegan creme fraiche + a healthy dose of trinidad scorpion
4019 2018-06-26 16:47:53 Hope you didn’t throw out the oil drum and that you mowed the grass bare chested #northern

4022 2018-06-26 16:47:36 If Nigeria doesn't form a United Tribunal like UN to replace bias with rules of engagement, this ping pong game continues till oil runs out.

4024 2018-06-26 16:47:33 Someone threw a bottle of omega 3 capsules at me ... Luckily my injuries were only super fish oil 
4025 2018-06-26 16:47:31 Totally irrelevant to current pipeline situation. These liberals hate oil and Canada. Keep up with the times.
4026 2018-06-26 16:47:19 Some tilapia fish - cleaned and de-boned or you can use mackerel (but I prefer fresh tilapia), cooking oil, onion (just one or half will do), and then your spices - pepper, salt, jumbo, black pepper, etc.
4027 2018-06-26 16:47:10 Aku juga gituuu pas pake bio oil mayan mengurang tapi aku males lanjutin lagi heheheheh maapin anaknya mageran :(

4031 2018-06-26 16:46:45 Would go quicker if they can hit Saudi oil facilities
4032 2018-06-26 16:46:39 Bio oil kali ya?
4033 2018-06-26 16:46:35 Bravo !
Iran's oil money goes into #Mullahs pockets and not a peny is spent for people, so it's much better all exports be halted
4034 2018-06-26 16:46:28 @timkaine I just wanted to thank you for your reply to me regarding the farm bill. As a long time advocate for @nokidhungry, and a mother that relies on hemp cbd oil, I hope you can all agree on a balanced and fair bill that helps farmers and protects consumers.

4038 2018-06-26 16:45:20 oil definitely has beautiful repeating patterns ive noticed. Just need to open a proper futures broker and give it a proper shot
4039 2018-06-26 16:45:20 One of the benefits of natural gas over oil is that it doesn’t require on site storage. This saves you the hassle of maintaining oil tanks and remembering to refill them.
4040 2018-06-26 16:45:15 1. Low 60s maybe 59
2. 76-78 next

4. Fed reverses policy to QE on steroids, dollar slides, Oil to >$100
Clear?
4041 2018-06-26 16:45:09 Looking at the schedule, we have a few openings for this week...do you need an alignment? Brakes? Check engine light? Front end work? Tires? Air conditioner work? Oil Change? Tire rotation? We can help! Give us a call! 785-336-2828
4042 2018-06-26 16:45:07 They are all in the same association. It is like a cult. Even Atiku will never come out to condemn their activities. Nigerians are besieged by these scavengers and criminals. They own the oil wells, they own everything yet not satisfied. Britain is Nigeria’s biggest externalenemy
4043 2018-06-26 16:45:02 @allanaramaa Ola! Husband has a beard butttttt it’s not fluffy lol. What does DEJAN use? Balm/Oil?? (Hope I spelled his name right) Thks bunches! 
4044 2018-06-26 16:45:01 The ban doesn’t even target the people who actually had something to do with 9/11. It’s pathetic to me and shows it’s not about keeping the country safe but enforcing supremacist ideologies they still shake hands with the people who helped kill our people because of oil WAKE UP!
4045 2018-06-26 16:44:57 It’s called OIL aka #texastea
4046 2018-06-26 16:44:56 This is a rough question. Without Dick or Newt, we likely wouldn't have wound up with the latter two. They sure do oil the gears of the war & prison industrial complexes...
4047 2018-06-26 16:44:52 Oil and vinegar, instead? #garbled
4048 2018-06-26 16:44:47 Hahaha I think you actually need to change your oil, but don’t listen to me. I know nothing about car lol

4054 2018-06-26 16:44:21 Yaaaaa we’re moving HOPEFULLLYTYT in August. The house is too expensive in the winter bc of oil >__> and keeping up w the yard wasn’t happening lmao
4055 2018-06-26 16:44:04 I didn’t see him at first either.
4056 2018-06-26 16:44:01 I'm guessing the ratio machine might need an oil change after that tweet.
4057 2018-06-26 16:43:53 Went shopping early this morning. Bought a tom of fresh veggies to roast. Washed & chopped everything, tossed with olive oil & salt, & gently placed in the oven. And promptly forgot about them.

Slow traffic and partially blocked due to accident, two vehicles involved on A470 at Arran Road.
The vehicles are awaiting recovery and the council have been called to clear the oil in the road.

4065 2018-06-26 16:43:15 the Navarro Rally or the Oil Rally?
4066 2018-06-26 16:43:15 Not in the way they're used by conservatives to justify Lochner-inspired garbage decisions. It's intellectual snake oil peddling to say that we can only take things at face value without looking at context and intent.
4067 2018-06-26 16:43:13 Oh didn't even see him there tbh lol

4071 2018-06-26 16:43:04 Olive oil tasting is a great date idea. Get real weird with the oil mixtures. They usually have some balsamics too.
4072 2018-06-26 16:43:04 Dude. You're using a shit grinder. You're still drinking shit coffee. Get a proper burr grinder. #CoffeeSnob
4073 2018-06-26 16:43:03 Because every truck guy wants to pull over every 100 miles to recharge when he’s towing something. I’ll stick with diesel.
4074 2018-06-26 16:42:58 Well, we got left behind this morning to wait for a phone call from the truck driver bringing block. 3yo very upset until I got him to help me clean house. He is GREAT at "mopping," but it takes a LOT of lemon oil to do the furniture when he's wielding the rag.
4075 2018-06-26 16:42:53 They also promised repeal n replace of Obamacare? What's next more campaign reelection snake oil?
4076 2018-06-26 16:42:48 Look for it just inside the door at Borders with a giant $1.99 sticker on the cover.

4079 2018-06-26 16:42:26 I don't think anyone took them seriously. It was pretty clear from the start they were setting out to sabotage Alberta and oil transport.
4080 2018-06-26 16:42:20 Let's expand on this: 15 of the 19 9/11 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia. Osama bin Laden was from Saudi Arabia.

But Saudi Arabia is not on the ban list.

Because we buy oil from them. 
Also, the Trump Organization does business there.
4081 2018-06-26 16:42:20 Trump admin. calls on U.S. allies to end oil imports from Iran by November 2018
4082 2018-06-26 16:42:19 Terrible idea to get burned by splashing oil.
4083 2018-06-26 16:42:15 i also do oil changes now

4090 2018-06-26 16:41:39 i’m just here to get oil changed, das it
4091 2018-06-26 16:41:39 Brian Ackerman called Oil a huge short at $50 in 2001 and it continued to north of $100 a barrel
Contrarian call is to be bullish on what he believes is a short.
Personally have always been surprised BNN ever had him on their program again after he got price of oil so wrong
4092 2018-06-26 16:41:32 I don’t have my prayer oil on me but I will be sure to send one up for boys, lol

4105 2018-06-26 16:40:47 I should put baby oil on the floor and start whooping Jataris ass when he get out the shower
4106 2018-06-26 16:40:30 So I’m waiting to get an oil change & they’re playing Jerry springer in the waiting room

4109 2018-06-26 16:40:18 CoW was snake oil con artists pilfering assembly money. Had no chance of becoming a reality.

The lagoon was a chance to become a world leader in a new, green technology. Tories are indefensible on this one.
4110 2018-06-26 16:40:14 Hellmann's Avocado Oil Mayonnaise Dressing combines the irresistible creamy, rich taste you love with a blend of quality oils (avocado, canola, and soy). It's high in Omega-3 ALA and Vitamin E, also gluten-free and certified kosher.
4111 2018-06-26 16:40:13 Damn WTI just hit $70. Everyone thought oil was going to crash last week when OPEC met. That’s good for the American oil companies.

4115 2018-06-26 16:40:03 So weird...

How can an American be Anti America if they live in America? That's like saying ur Anti Oil Drilling but ur still filling ur car up with gasoline and using petroleum based products everyday.
4116 2018-06-26 16:39:55 Hence why a few hours before that announcement, the Saudis were signalling a big oil production increase for July
4117 2018-06-26 16:39:37 If we are then that’s no thanks to our leaders cause with our oil and stuff Nigeria is definitely not supposed to be a poor country. We actually aren’t, but then looted funds makes us seem so

4123 2018-06-26 16:39:24 Maybe S Korea, Japan & India will buy more light crude from US, but Saudi Arabia planing to increase production of light crude oil. When it comes down to it, will Trump offer a waiver for Iranian crude to China to smooth over trade negotiations? Or will we see the reverse?

4133 2018-06-26 16:38:47 I used to apply lots of coconut oil and baby oil too
4134 2018-06-26 16:38:46 The Dakotas are among the 40 states that I've visited in my lifetime. Nothing special, sorry to disappoint. You're Kansas, only with oil.
4135 2018-06-26 16:38:44 People at work today were calling me weird because I use coconut oil on my body and they thought it was only for cooking 
4136 2018-06-26 16:38:42 My mum got that whatsapp message, apparently they fry the stuff with ‘haram’ oil 
4137 2018-06-26 16:38:31 @JoeyJacksonEsq love watching you on HLN. I understand that this is not your department within the CNN Corporation, but I am sick of seeing these commercials for the Prevagen supplement. This company is a proven fraud, and peddling nothing but snake oil. Please help me!
4138 2018-06-26 16:38:28 Oil ripping up shorts help keep SPX up
4139 2018-06-26 16:38:11 Read every label. Palm oil can be found in tons of food products. It will surprise you.
Never buy anything w/ palm oil as an ingredient.
4140 2018-06-26 16:38:08 Well it's not the oil but the fact that a global market is constantly using dollars. It stabilizes the value of the currency which became important when the US left the gold standard.
4141 2018-06-26 16:38:07 DeGrease  23 DeGrease here too 12:30 coconut oil on while I’m selling burgers in the park #youwantfrieswiththat

We’re headed for recession fast.
4143 2018-06-26 16:38:01 Watching oil stocks here.  WTI back through 70, oil stocks not following yet.  $XOM, $MPC, $DVN, $COP, $WLL.  Think we see them ramp up.  $MPC oversold here.

4145 2018-06-26 16:38:01 Mmk...all TX has is oil  Cali does have a huge economy so it boggles my mind as to why they're so in debt. How do you bring in more $$ than some small countries & manage to piss it all away & have nothing left to show for it? Oh, that's right, those pesky policies again.

4148 2018-06-26 16:37:37 Peppermint oil works for me sometimes!
4149 2018-06-26 16:37:37 hate when i come to get an oil change and they take forever
4150 2018-06-26 16:37:36 In the 1970s the country was on its knees, Scottish oil and EU membership saved the day, London and the South of England were the only area to have benefitted, the rest of the country were fed scraps and left to wither.
4151 2018-06-26 16:37:32 Why does it take an hour and a half for an oil change  someone pick me up from the Shakopee Ford PLEASE 
4152 2018-06-26 16:37:30 Add oil or butter too
4153 2018-06-26 16:37:27 With Nigeria having massive quantity of crude oil, why are Nigerians living in extreme poverty.?
4154 2018-06-26 16:37:22 The men can't get away with promoting violence, so the few female crazies r going full force.  I'm sure it's a strategic plan.
4155 2018-06-26 16:37:21 If y’all could’ve seen what that magnesium oil did to me last night.......I slept so hard I forgot I was still in Hawaii
4156 2018-06-26 16:37:17 Vegetable oil on the pole.
4157 2018-06-26 16:37:09 Before you bath baby, apply a few drops of baby oil. Let soak for about 15min. Shampoo the hair with baby shampoo, let dry and gently comb the flakes out of the hair. Do this every day if it's really bad.
4158 2018-06-26 16:36:52 Covering myself in baby oil and burning myself to a crisp in this weather is my fav thing to do
4159 2018-06-26 16:36:47 That sweet, metallic rasp of voice coil on magnet. 

Like burnt 2-stroke oil, it takes us straight back to the 1970s.
4160 2018-06-26 16:36:40 Ah, but for the ‘data is the new oil’ brigade this isn’t a priority.
4161 2018-06-26 16:36:39 Now I could point out the American terrorism in the Middle East where our soldiers were conned into killing Iraqis (not all done would’ve done it anyway but they’re in the minority) for “freedom” when it was really about oil...same with Afghanistan poppy fields...just saying
4162 2018-06-26 16:36:39 Well all the big oil companies are heavily invested in them. Those  gas prices are due to blowing up the Iran deal. However in NK we’ve gotten nothing and Russia and China are already loosening sanctions
4163 2018-06-26 16:36:30 Well, at least any middle class workers who didn't benefit from the Trump tax cuts, can now definitely benefit from the sky high oil prices
4164 2018-06-26 16:36:28 If President Jonathan owned an oil well, you would have used it against him by now.
4165 2018-06-26 16:36:24 U got to wonder how KIM Y U is viewing Trump lie's to him about Opening up his country to Trade/travel, when Trump just slapped a Travel Ban on N.K through Supreme court. Saudi/Iran just did a oil deal for the U.S, wonder if that will go to hell/sense Iran on that travel ban too?
4166 2018-06-26 16:36:23 Get yirself oot on ma decking shakin and brushin the midnight oil in. Or you're skint for August
4167 2018-06-26 16:36:21 Deforestation caused by palm oil is decimating species such as orangutans and tigers - but the alternatives could be worse, finds recent report by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN)
4168 2018-06-26 16:36:13 If you find a betterdeal let me know 8 for20 you oil  lovers......... Tell a friend  when they purchase YA bottle free
4169 2018-06-26 16:36:13 Drastically lower oil prices and a federal government that seems intent on crippling the sector with regulations as well as a carbon tax are just a few of the changes since Harper was in office.
4170 2018-06-26 16:36:08 because there would be repercussions if they did that. saudi arabia could cut oil or raise oil prices, and they own hundreds of billions of our debt. we need pakastani immigrants in IT and healthcare because of a skilled labor shortage, and egypt has a dictator so of course...

4173 2018-06-26 16:35:53 The combination of supply issues in Oil, mixed with ECB ending of stimulus, will result in the ECB aggressively raising rates to stop inflationary pressure. Bonds are massively mispriced in Europe and this will reveal the dollars dirty little secret. #dxy #eurusd
4174 2018-06-26 16:35:46 Get you a partner that adds scorpion pepper, chili oil, chili flakes, oh...and, for color, cayenne to a dish 
4175 2018-06-26 16:35:46 All I have to ask is how come Saudi Arabia isn't on the list.  This is  where the 9-ll terrorists came from.  Could it be......OIL.........?
4176 2018-06-26 16:35:37 Sorry Kevin it’s happening to the best of us. On the bright side, I’m sure that you can get Him’s to sponsor the podcast now and get some snake oil to help you out.
4177 2018-06-26 16:35:28 trump to china .. don't use iranian oil and by the way we will have a trade war at the same time
4178 2018-06-26 16:35:27 @POTUS @Senate @Congress @SpeakerRyan @SenMajLdr @RepCummings @RepOrrinHatch @ChuckGrassley @SenGraham @SenBobCorker  Why Doesn't Trump Get That: Oil DRILLING & Natural Gas FRACKING  IS Destroying Our Water & Wildlife & Our Environment? OUR Food Chain, Water
4179 2018-06-26 16:35:21 #America  INSANE @potus @scotus #dictators #putin #gop controlled #Congress as #APPEASERS corrupt #nepotism #TRUMP clan HEY America how do you like that @EPA what about HUGE oil spill #IOWA little butter substitute oil for your #POPCORN warning NO clean #H2O available on EARTH
4180 2018-06-26 16:35:18 It sounds like an attempt to impose starvation sanctions against the Iranian people, as happened with the “Food-for-oil” starvation sanctions against the Iraqi people in the 1990s. Such sanctions are immoral and inhumane.
4181 2018-06-26 16:35:18 You were a small kid at the time of Nasbandi, if you would have born in the 1950's & you would have taken 5kg of imported butter oil in lieu of your Nasbandi, you could feel the pain of Emergency as many people suffered after Nasbandi.
4182 2018-06-26 16:35:13 Any Demark update on oil prices?
4183 2018-06-26 16:34:51 how much oil does or did the US get from Iran?
4184 2018-06-26 16:34:37 AND MOHAMMAD IS SWEET AND TELL HIM MAKE VIDEO CALL AND TALK ABOUT "ICLIS" AND "MILLI MECLIS" AND I MISS HIM AND TELL HIM AND USE LOTUS OIL FOR HAIR AND I LOVE YOU AND HAMDAN CALLS EVERY DAY AND WHAT ABOUT YOU AND YOU HAVE HUSBAND DUTIES
4185 2018-06-26 16:34:30 Wishful thinking. It was stopped because people could stop it. Same logic applies to the perpetual cycle of oil blockades. A sustainable governance model will weed out these controls nightmares.
4186 2018-06-26 16:34:30 Morning beauty!  I hit the ground running this morning, got my oil changed, tires rotated, ran some errands and back home before lunch time!!
4187 2018-06-26 16:34:24 And if transport and jobs in Aberdeenshire was so important to the tories and Westminster then why is it only in 2018 that we will finally have a by-pass just 50 odd years after first oil?
4188 2018-06-26 16:34:15 Idk who that person was and I can't find her video but I'll forever be thankful for that woman who made a YouTube video about shaving and told me to use olive oil instead of shaving cream. I hope you're living your best life girl because I'm now living mine, thanks to you
4189 2018-06-26 16:34:12 India political parties new r bluffing master buffing schemes bluff schemes. Ancient political parties policy really works common sector. No rise price oil and gas n extinct economy corruption
4190 2018-06-26 16:34:11 Getting stuck in a traffic jam next to a huge field full of oil seed rape when I have stinking hayfever may just have been my least favourite part of the year so far. #hayfever

4195 2018-06-26 16:34:03 Corporates will never take steps against their share holders interest unlike a Govt which will do things to garner  popular mandate of the people. These meetings are only sampark 4 samarthan ! Eco climate definitely not capex ready yet & oil price overhang looms large .
4196 2018-06-26 16:33:59 A senior #US official on Tuesday said the State Department has conveyed a message to #European diplomats that companies that buy #Iran|ian crude oil must completely cut those exports by the start of November or else they will face powerful US sanctions - CNBC
4197 2018-06-26 16:33:57 Great call on $DWT, hit above $8 for awhile! I notice your 3x rule. Oil Tested the 61.8% at $69.40 and then broke through. Interested in reloading at the right time.

4199 2018-06-26 16:33:49 Which stocks would that be ?????? Penny stocks is where u can make millions on the right stock . Yes I also have 2 big stocks but it's in oil as I posted long ago
4200 2018-06-26 16:33:46 So Trump is pushing zero oil imports from Iran by enforcing it against any country that buys their oil - is the fact that this will rescue Russia and payback for his election only incidental?
4201 2018-06-26 16:33:45 sooo excited for my new @KoiCbd oil!!!! 
4202 2018-06-26 16:33:30 Abrumador! hace unos días lei de alguien que decía que "cuando Nayib fuera presidente, iba a regular los precios de la gasolina" le dije "amiga, eso obedece a precios internacionales del OIL" y me contestó "no subestimes el poder y contactos que tiene Nayib"
4203 2018-06-26 16:33:30 we act like oil is demanded but when trump cut supplies and renewable to help his friends and epa freed what did u expect we all now pay our tax break in tariffs and gasoline
4204 2018-06-26 16:33:28 Yeah but can it “fake throw”?
4205 2018-06-26 16:33:24 U were there gettin beat up by Ryan ova an oil change

4209 2018-06-26 16:33:10 Looks like the most important line is this one “The official said an important part of those discussions was making sure countries aren’t “adversely affected” by cutting Iranian oil imports.”
Cutting off Iran would raise prices and adversely affect importers
4210 2018-06-26 16:33:09 Trump told Kim Y U he was going to open up N.K&give them freedom to trade an Travel&today the Supreme court Slapped a Travel ban of Trump on N.K! Wonder how he feels about that lie! Also Saudi/Iran came to a oil/crude agreement to supply the U.S/then put a travel ban on Iran!OOPS
4211 2018-06-26 16:33:08 Not. No, you have patience without limits. I also do oil paintings, and I have already told you, that the degree of difficulty is enormous. You're one of the best I know. In World Art. Yes
4212 2018-06-26 16:32:53 I have to correct the "spitting" statement...Pam Biondi was spat on at the theater..she is NOT a cabinet member..she is the Florida AG

4216 2018-06-26 16:32:24 Ever since I started walking to work I've only had to get gas every 2 weeks and change my oil once this year so far

But I've also started drinking 3x a week so I'm not really sure if I'm winning here
4217 2018-06-26 16:32:18 New throttle body, new breaks, new tires & oil change & inspection.... #imbroke
4218 2018-06-26 16:32:14 @EricaRHill Love watching HLN, your show in particular.

4220 2018-06-26 16:32:01 Just made this glorious hair oil and now I smell like carrots lol it’s worth it tho
4221 2018-06-26 16:31:59 Will the proceeds go straight to federation account ?  Or that applies only to Oil ?
4222 2018-06-26 16:31:59 My Magnesium oil from @BetterYou_UK arrived courtesy of @RekindleKenya. Been using their Turmeric Oral Spray with good results.
4223 2018-06-26 16:31:44 PS: If we wanted oil from Middle East - we would have TAKEN it.

You know?
Kinda like how Germany looted all of Europes art and stuff.

Fortunately: America doesnt conquer and steal.

We liberate and democratize. 

No thanks to Germany. Again. 
4224 2018-06-26 16:31:37 Bank of America Merrill Lynch said Brent Oil could rise to $90 a barrel by Q2 2019
effects of the global trade dispute between the United States and other major economies including the European Union and China were gradually taking effect.
 trade fight + sharp sell-offs in asia.
4225 2018-06-26 16:31:37 Time to get the popcorn ready. I will bow out. But we will just agree or disagree here.
4226 2018-06-26 16:31:28 I won’t either. I annoy people by scrutinising avocados, hummus, olive oil, fruit...thing is, although I’ve asked no supermarket will give me a list!
4227 2018-06-26 16:31:17 Oil at more than $70/barrel, thanks Trump, now gas will climb to more than $3.00/gallon, and Venezuela,Iran and Russia will be rich again
4228 2018-06-26 16:31:06 While we're still mainly using oil for fuel we should be getting a better deal on the price, but the quicker we transfer our use of it to alternative energy the better. Economically it is better for us. It's not just a tree-hugger or environmentalist issue. It's economics.
4229 2018-06-26 16:30:56 Listening to the  mainstream media chat shit about Teslas is just fucking embarrassing. Just proves the oil giants are getting desperate. Electric and hybrid cars are here to stay, get over it!
4230 2018-06-26 16:30:52 Pakai selalu 2-3 times a days, and always alwayssss moisturize. I use 2-3 drops rosehip oil, and then blot off excess. It helps with my scarring, and muka nampak dewy instead of oily. But vit e, aloe vera is good too. Experiment, see whats good for you.
4231 2018-06-26 16:30:49 Even if a link were ever established between CO2 emissions and global warming, remember that the oil companies only drill for oil, refine then distribute it. It is the motorist who spills CO2 into the atmosphere. They should sue themselves
4232 2018-06-26 16:30:48 You gotta give us credit for figuring out shale oil    ...
4233 2018-06-26 16:30:44 Have you tried CBD oil? Back issues are the worst.

4242 2018-06-26 16:30:14 It was my understanding all along that Trump and Co. were not going to be granting any waivers and that they would impose secondary sanctions on those buying Iranian oil. But I guess there was some belief that there would be exemptions.

4257 2018-06-26 16:29:09 Great!  CBD oil availableat my office.  Remember to purchase from a reputable source. UPenn study confirmed that 70% of online CBD oil was not as advertised. FDA approves first marijuana-based epilepsy drug: CBD oil - USA TODAYhttps://apple.news/AM_vx-pTiT8evyj3T_hT_UQ
4258 2018-06-26 16:29:07 The oil should bring back Yakupov and Davidson with a one year affordable deal to re-establish themselves as nhl pros. That can be asset accumulation for summer blockbuster deals.

4270 2018-06-26 16:27:57 Bad day for America. 
Supreme Court voted for travel ban,against choice, and Big Oil won a case against the environment. There are also mining stakes claimed on formerly protected land.This must end.
4271 2018-06-26 16:27:52 One thing I'd really like to try out this year now that I've graduated is oil painting. Oil paint looks tricky but really fun to experiment with. I've tried watercolors already but I think oil paint might suit me more? Too bad art supplies are so expensiveee..

4273 2018-06-26 16:27:43 Inhumane laws and any law against the US Constitution, the same one I swore to defend, is wrong. I'm not Native American so, I could be next. How about you? Is it ok to kill kids for oil like desert Storm? I'm not going argue your beliefs so stop trying to argue mine
4274 2018-06-26 16:27:40 Why aren’t the countries that attacked us on our own soil on that ban? Saudi Arabia (19) UAE(2) Egypt (1) Lebanon (1) ALL the Hijackers from 9/11.  Could it be that OIL is more important to @POTUS & @GOP than American lives?

This is a country with Oil & Agricultural advantages.

Sad.
4284 2018-06-26 16:26:29 Yes, because the only economy bigger than Texas is....oh, it’s California. You do realize that all we have is oil? If that goes, so goes Texas. It’s not like we have a genius running things down in Austin.
4285 2018-06-26 16:26:27 Logic: If IGAD & AU r 2 b watchdogs on Cease-fire, then wat's Sudan's intention of securing oil fields?

4290 2018-06-26 16:26:08 It’s the only way to be sure.
4291 2018-06-26 16:26:03 Surprised to see you put that since Saudi Arabia has not only been funding Al Qaeda, but 15 of the 19 hijackers in 9/11 were from Saudi Arabia. However, we are still "allies" with them because of their oil trades. By definition, Saudi Arabia is a state sponsor of terrorism.
4292 2018-06-26 16:25:54 Oil has to rally,with snake oil conferences ,carnivals on the rise, oil is in big demand
4293 2018-06-26 16:25:53 Weird how none of those countries had anything to do with 9/11 (the event that started the scare tactics of hating Muslims) meanwhile Saudi Arabia isn’t on the list where the majority of the hijackers came from  almost like they have the most oil and sell it to us amirite?
4294 2018-06-26 16:25:40 The reason Saudi Arabia wasn't on that list is due to political, economical and geopolitical reasons. Saudi is maintaining the petrodollar by trading their oil in dollars and in return the US provides them with defense. Pissing them off isn't a good idea at the moment.
4295 2018-06-26 16:25:38 No position on oil for awhile now, but will admit I didn’t see these last two spikes coming. Let’s see how your 62 plays out.

4297 2018-06-26 16:25:32 And they will still leak oil.
4298 2018-06-26 16:25:32 Maybe they’ll get them to quit leaking oil
4299 2018-06-26 16:25:21 Yeah and those terrorists were all from Saudi Arabia, who don’t have any ban because we are oil allies...

4393 2018-06-26 16:17:06 The Trump administration is pushing U.S. allies to cut their oil imports from Iran to zero by November. President Donald Trump last month withdrew the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal. Sanctions on Iran's energy sector that were eased will kick back in after a grace period.

4440 2018-06-26 16:14:04 Yes, but oil & companies associated with oil were down yesterday because the market thought the Trump's trade wars were leading to a recession. Oil will go down again with falling demand.
4441 2018-06-26 16:13:55 No travel ban on Saudis then but Venezuela? Oh yea big oil been lusting after their oil for years
4442 2018-06-26 16:13:50 Trump has done well giving Saudi more market share and bringing an end to cheap oil. But that doesn’t help Americans maybe frackers
4443 2018-06-26 16:13:43 The "system" supported slavery, denied their children education, created separate water fountains, punished those who ate at the same dining counters, lynched people for existing, denied their veterans clothes and weapons, and undermined voting access & legal representation.

4445 2018-06-26 16:13:33 Pence just wants to invade Venezuela and steal the oil for his deep state friends. The people of Venezuela should realize that no government, especially not their own or USA's, is interested in helping them become free and prosperous.

4460 2018-06-26 16:12:20 Governments may not be worried about #inflation, but bond investors soon will be.  I wonder how much longer before surging oil prices send bond prices tanking?  Remember it's the unexpected problems that do the most damage. No one expects inflation!
4461 2018-06-26 16:12:17 Interestingly enough Nigeria boasts as much about oil as Venezuela yet it seems to have done little to show for in terms of well being to their people. Makes one wonder whether oil can play dual role as nature´s blessing or government´s damnation.

India's 2 bigeest banks have ADRs listed in the US, so impossible to pull off same thing.  Another Iraq oil swap coming?
4466 2018-06-26 16:11:44 So much for curbing oil prices.
4467 2018-06-26 16:11:32 We’re the richest country on earth and somehow thats bad to u.  Youre just a hater.  Obama mightve failed elsewhere, the economy was not one of them.  He even made us the top oil producer at one point.  Notice how gas went up after withdrawal from Iran deal.
4468 2018-06-26 16:11:32 also, bristol is pretty smooth, I can't remember if it bleeds though so take that with a grain of salt. I think it stood up fairly well against oil paint though. 

& sort of marker paper (that isn't like HELLA cheap quality) tends to be p smooth too.

4472 2018-06-26 16:11:26 Guess what? Barclays fund climate-wrecking projects. Tar sands- huge deposits of bitumen (a petroleum with tar-like texture) that is refined into oil. They’re dirty, expensive, inefficient & massively polluting. @BarclaysUK join @HSBC No more money for climate-wrecking pipelines!

4475 2018-06-26 16:11:10 That was my stupidly made point. The bank accounts haven't changed hands and in the end that's what matters if the oil keeps flowing.
4476 2018-06-26 16:11:10 Why is oil $70 a barrel. If gas is $4 a gallon come Election Day, that’s great news for democrats.

4478 2018-06-26 16:11:08 
4479 2018-06-26 16:11:07 Oil prices being $75 per barrel should herald a new era of diversification of the economy, infrastructural development and savings. I'm sure Oil might be hovering around $90-$100 per barrel before the year ends.

4505 2018-06-26 16:09:39 We should have taken Iran's oil. We could lower the gas prices and help save money for our crunchy roll subscriptions.
4506 2018-06-26 16:09:33 The impact of rising oil prices is felt after a gap, not instantly like #VikasMishra 's transfer. High prices of essential commo is the domino effect of high oil prices. 1/n

4511 2018-06-26 16:09:07 North Sea  Oil will probably be winding down by the time it's completed. The number of flights split amongst the airports will make little or no difference to Aberdeen.
4512 2018-06-26 16:09:03 I figure everyone is just talking about Richard Kruger, CEO of Imperial Oil.
4513 2018-06-26 16:08:57 Forget about oil. The good in question doesn’t matter.

So prices affect buying decisions, and production decisions. An increase in price will lead to a greater supply and lower demand, and a a decrease will have the opposite effect? Do you agree?
4514 2018-06-26 16:08:57 Oil companies would pitch #ShaleAsAService
4515 2018-06-26 16:08:47 initially in 08 it was high oil prices that caused deflation of most everything else, it just sucked the cash out of the economy and America can't handle that now anymore than we would then. this time the tipping point could be even lower
4516 2018-06-26 16:08:44 Non ci credo. La Maersk e' un colosso nel settore marittimo e Oil & Gas. Non si associa con ong ed associati.Probabilmente fa la spola con Tripoli da itinerario.

4529 2018-06-26 16:07:51 So many great scenes/set-plays. And the score periodically creeping up on you like a room filling with oil. Tremendous stuff. I heard the sequel is meant to be pretty good too.
4530 2018-06-26 16:07:46 Probably needed to replace the oil, clean the the filter, new spark plug. bad gas too.
Pay some one to do this. instead of, paying to cut your grass every two weeks. It's is a push mower or riding one.

4565 2018-06-26 16:04:08 As oil prices surge back above $70 per barrel, the #stagflation warnings signs are flashing brighter than ever.  But the bank stress tests revealed that not only does the government not see the signs, but actually thinks stagflation is impossible.  It's in for quite a shock!
4566 2018-06-26 16:04:01 With crude oil infrastructure within our plans, as a country and region being enlisted as an oil producing and exporting countries, the region is prosperity bound.
4567 2018-06-26 16:03:59 And a judge just threw out SF/Oakland lawsuit against "big oil."

4575 2018-06-26 16:03:24 Sure although I would argue that there should be limitations on how much oil companies can produce since it appears to be damaging the environment.

4578 2018-06-26 16:03:17 About time!! As long as 8 cylinder Ford F-150 trucks are the biggest selling vehicle in North America, you know individuals are doing next to nothing to “save the planet” as they love to say. Check out how they show up to rallies. It’s like they don’t think gas comes from oil.

4580 2018-06-26 16:02:58 I think China can negotiate to buy in Yuan whereas India will try to buy in credit . However there is a possibility that both could reduce their imports from Iran. There is also a possibility that they could use the barter system to import Iranian oil

4584 2018-06-26 16:02:51 Hydrogen continues the use of hydrocarbons, oil and gas. With global warming it is morally wrong to develop that tech when solar and wind power can just as easily provide carbon neutral energy sources for cars. And it's all safer than hydrogen.

4589 2018-06-26 16:02:24 I'm sure it was over reach and a policy that would tie the hands of the USA and force more dependence on oil from foreign countries. Adding to the treasure chest of those who would like nothing more than to destroy the USA.
4590 2018-06-26 16:02:22 A senior State Department official affirmed Tuesday the Trump administration expects ALL countries to reduce their Iranian oil imports to zero by the November 4th deadline and does not expect to issue waivers.

4615 2018-06-26 16:00:04 The mainstream media hates the truth. It is boring and doesn’t sell. So they craft a narrative, either distorted or blatantly false, in order to get the juices flowing. Journalists are snake oil peddlers for the brain. Good thing the alternative media are replacing them.

4633 2018-06-26 15:59:26 So that’s the demand half. Prices affect the demand for a good. What about supply? Do you think that prices affect production? If the price of oil goes up, you’d agree that this would incentive companies to produce more, right?

4653 2018-06-26 15:57:47 With the exception of ammonium nitrate, which we let Texas blow itself up with, most of the agricultural chemicals are made on the East Coast, and those plants making them in the midwest rely on Canadian oil pipelines.
4654 2018-06-26 15:57:45 Had drinks with a really nice bunch of oil rig workers from three different continents. None of them have university degrees but they all disapprove of socialism, illegal immigration and the concept of white privilege. Genuinely hard work will do that to you, eh?
4655 2018-06-26 15:57:42 Well there is good news- at least Muslims won't suffer the US economic destruction on the horizon, and Muslim countries still control the worlds oil.

Which is why the government try to keep everything moderate (except Aceh).

Once EU fall in line, than Iran will have to renegotiate deal or go off the reservation.

4741 2018-06-26 15:51:47 Yes I agree Danny ,this particular stock gets more attention from most , probably because they invested in a very soft period for oil n gas exploration,circa 2008- 2014
4742 2018-06-26 15:51:44 All I know about oil from reading financial news over time is that high oil prices is bad for the stock market. Also low oil prices.

4805 2018-06-26 15:46:49 I just want to let you know. I’m done being civil. I practiced #civility & the GOP rolled back climate change, cut taxes for the rich & auctioned off public lands to oil companies.

4817 2018-06-26 15:45:19 What also matters is leftish-leaning living fossil SCOTUS justices retiring when a Democratic president is elected so that president can fill those seats with leftish justices who aren't 5 years from dissolving into crude oil. Fuck RBG and Breyer for leaving us in this situation.
4818 2018-06-26 15:45:12 Johnson baby oil. I repeat Johnson baby oil. That thing is getting costlier by d day
4819 2018-06-26 15:45:08 I'm in no way a fan of what they did, but it is interesting to note that considering 15 of the 911 hijackers came from Saudi Arabia that Saudi Arabia isn't included in the travel ban. But then it's always about the OIL, isn't it?

4824 2018-06-26 15:44:43 @PizzaToday_EIC okay. You asked for it. Regular pizza dough. Use a garlic infused yogurt as the sauce. Top it with grilled/sautéed Roma tomato slices and eggplant round slices. Add sautéed jalapeño slices. Drizzle olive oil and more yogurt sauce on top. Finish with dried mint.
4825 2018-06-26 15:44:37 Trump Admin says allies must cut buying of Iranian oil by November 4th.

Another gift to Putin. 

How long does this go on?
4826 2018-06-26 15:44:35 For a start, part of revenue, 80-90%, coming from oil will have to be replaced by direct and indirect taxes and the population will have to learn to live with it. Next would be finding new sectors to work on, Solar farms, greenhouse based agro, recycling, ( and sand castles ;) )

4829 2018-06-26 15:44:15 Would you like to know which products in ZA do/don't contain palm oil? (Or which ones contain certified sustainable palm oil not just good intentions)? I'm making a database & asking for excel and info loving volunteers to help add to it. Mail me: nopalmoilZA at gmail #nopalmoil
4830 2018-06-26 15:44:14 So now Trump runs the oil companies?
4831 2018-06-26 15:44:13 Palm oil should not be on this list.  May be better for your heart but it destroys rain forests, wild life habitat, and contributes heavily to global warming.  It's not all about what we put in our bodies but also where it comes from and what it does to our home.

Acha? Who owns top oil companies accross the world, where does the revenue go and from whose land oil gets extracted from? 
They never left, they wont leave especially now untill they return Kohenur 
4855 2018-06-26 15:42:35 Even if but trust me Khartoum doesn’t want to see us stable and control our oil, their main interest is in exploiting our oil to meet their needs

5108 2018-06-26 15:23:30 Protests need to be more grim to convey the existential threat coal, oil & gas pose to humanity. No neat suits philosophizing about possible next steps but a hard fast and possibly painfull phase out immediately. Renewables and storage are ready to go, time to end this toxic era!
5109 2018-06-26 15:23:29 Thirdly, the handing over of oil fields to Sudan to “secure” it is an other self centered point by the Khartoum government, therefore all the points were bogusly designed to suit not the needs of south Sudanese but for the benefit of neighbors especially Sudan government itself

5237 2018-06-26 15:15:31 It just seems this product is focused on strengthening facial muscles to make your jawline look better, not necessarily help with fatigue. Seems like snake oil! 
5238 2018-06-26 15:15:28 The gas prices were due to a tightening of Oil supply and the explosion of Deepwater Horizon. Had nothing to do with an administration.
5239 2018-06-26 15:15:14 I'd say if you're gonna preheat on stovetop, at least 6-10 mins, gas takes longer than coil when you're talking heat dispersion. Also, don't add oil until pan is hot. You'll need less, and it's less likely to burn
5240 2018-06-26 15:15:13 I need an oil change
5241 2018-06-26 15:15:11 Also oil rich areas? With the exception of NK ... which I found interesting as DT wants to bring Kim to the WH ...
5242 2018-06-26 15:15:08 @Scalp4it I don’t think oil will have a 70+ run soon
5243 2018-06-26 15:15:04 I really don’t want to go to the car dealership for a oil change
5244 2018-06-26 15:14:45 or c wears baby oil
5245 2018-06-26 15:14:42 $64 for an oil change bc i have synthetic oil in my car..... bye
5246 2018-06-26 15:14:37 Yes! They need to be focused on how the administration is trying to take away coverage of pre existing conditions, how they are allowing oil companies to ruin our water, and tariffs are hurting farmers and workers.  Not talking in circles about civility.
5247 2018-06-26 15:14:34 There no problem. Poppi made of special alloy. No need for rust or oil.
5248 2018-06-26 15:14:21 The administration of President Donald Trump wants to help allies and trade partners replicate the U.S. natural gas and oil production boom by exporting American know-how, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said on Tuesday, even as trade disputes in...
5249 2018-06-26 15:14:20 The wisdom of a colloquial expression in English, “If it’s not broke, don’t fix it,” didn't inform MX authorities in 2013-14. The energy reforms in the oil & power sectors sought to fix problems that had not been shown to the public to be real problems. Hence, @MorenaExterior_
5250 2018-06-26 15:14:17 Incentives for corruption will stay until oil revenues split in a local way and new central government unified. the incentive for LNA is to keep oil ports closed (effectively) until new politics of responsibility emerges in Tripoli.

5252 2018-06-26 15:14:04 So I’m at the dealer getting an oil change and the rep pretty much told me a new exhaust won’t void my warranty
5253 2018-06-26 15:13:57 When I went to Malaysia there was vast destruction of rainforest and miles of palm plantations that sell oil to European companies...

5255 2018-06-26 15:13:47 Ill take his oil away
5256 2018-06-26 15:13:45 I'm just plain tired. I've been in a perpetual state of sadness since it became apparent that people were actually swallowing the snake oil salesman's awful mixture of hateful rhetoric, rampant hypocrisy & outright lies. I still have faith in God but not in many of His followers.

5258 2018-06-26 15:13:36 娘、よく喋るんだけど全然会話なりたたない。
私「今日保育園で何したの？」

「そうかぁ、シャボン玉したんだって？」
「動物園にいきたいなーって、言ったの！」

5262 2018-06-26 15:13:26 No, we need to stop using fossil fuel and start using wind, solar and wave. If America made an industrial effort similar to what we did in WW2, we could quickly get off fossil, but the oil companies have a stranglehold on our government and business.

5264 2018-06-26 15:13:21 A lot of the Russian trolls use Canadian profiles. Notice how he uses the bad aspects of Islam to invite outrage. A truly Islamic  nutjob  will not be trading..because trading is 'haram' ..as it involves the interest component which is problematic as per Islamic law:)
5265 2018-06-26 15:13:16 Our prices closely track the crude oil price, we pass on reductions as quickly as we can, and shield our customers from dramatic price increases.TY - Mark
5266 2018-06-26 15:13:13 You are literally talking nonsense , Iran was a great democratic country ,until Americans helped to overthrown the government like usual to put some dictators who would be more American friendly with their oil. You are literally the last people to talk about iran.
5267 2018-06-26 15:13:11 Judge throws out 'climate change' suits against big oil...Like blaming doctors for patient deaths!
5268 2018-06-26 15:13:10 There is nothing else that is economically feasible at this time if we stopped using oil. Why punish companies for selling us something we need?
5269 2018-06-26 15:13:06 You look real fun to play with, the baby oil is the biggest turn on.

5271 2018-06-26 15:12:56 This is laughable, rolling on the floor laughable. The oil and gas sector spends the most on environmental protection because it's the most polluting AND what it's spending isn't even remotely sufficient to address the harm it's doing. Laughable if it wasn't so tragic.
5272 2018-06-26 15:12:52 listen. i have to blot mcdonald's fish burger with like 10 paper towels before i've soaked up just hALF the oil. mos is like. holy grail stuff
5273 2018-06-26 15:12:48 ということは4つに分離しようと思ったらoilをsearingまで加熱して分離しながら温度を下げていくのがいいのかな
residueはゴミなのでsearingのままで捨てちゃっていいし
5274 2018-06-26 15:12:47 Bought another brand of ice cream that is made from milk and no simi simi oil added!
5275 2018-06-26 15:12:36 Transportation accounts for about 15% globally and 25% in the US of GHG emissions. Pretty much all from oil. And that doesn't count gas. That industry seems like a pretty worthy target to me!
5276 2018-06-26 15:12:31 I need some coconut oil to get back on my protein treatments my hair could be so much longer had I not started getting lazy
5277 2018-06-26 15:12:31 You wash with oil?

5285 2018-06-26 15:12:00 No, water on hot oil
5286 2018-06-26 15:11:55 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
5287 2018-06-26 15:11:53 just like me & mayonaise i rather drink veg oil

5299 2018-06-26 15:10:38 how long do you recommend preheating? I have no experience so I kind of just waited for the oil to spread evenly over a minute or two. Def open to tips (TWSS)

5301 2018-06-26 15:10:32 Also you could argue that Christians cause more terrorism then Muslims since Christian based governments like the U.S. government starts and inflicts terrorism on countries like Iran & Iraq for switching over to Euro for oil.

5307 2018-06-26 15:10:00 There are trade issues that could stunt growth and seasonally the market will be out of peak  demand for oil. Today the Saudi's announced record output for July. Gasoline demand has not grown. Market looks like a big short after the 4th. 2/2 #OOTT

I bet he doesn't blink, he just stands and slumps over at night to recharge, and for breakfast you have to pour oil into an opening that distributes it throughout his whole body

"How about your registration"
"You're driving with out your registration?"
"Insurance?"

All in front of an on duty Police officer lol.
5315 2018-06-26 15:09:21 But I do agree. Saudi Arabia should be on the list. But again, it'd be economical suicide. The crown prince is alao taking a hard stance against both the wahhabi clerics, fundamentalism and corruption.

But yes, ban them too. Shame they have a monopoly on oil.

5339 2018-06-26 15:07:12 I am still trying to grasp how adding a million barrels of supply a day would cause the market to rally. OPEC is working on the assumption that oil demand will pick up by 2 MBD In the second half of the year. I don't see it that way --1/2 #OOTT

5344 2018-06-26 15:06:56 Sorry bro but they did that to themselves when they shifted production to foreign countries to protect their bottom line. Cold hard truth is the competition is fierce and the people they want to sell to don’t want to scrub oil stains off the garage floor every weekend

5375 2018-06-26 15:03:24 Here's a meal prep day for me:

Boil chickpeas and eggs. While these are cooking, chop up some avocados, onions, and prepare salad dressing (olive oil+vinegar).

Throw everything plus tuna in a bowl and mix. 

Congratulations, you now have at least 6 large filling meals.
5376 2018-06-26 15:03:20 So, we OFICIALLY don't want Muslims here, but I bet we still want their OIL...….

5383 2018-06-26 15:02:38 Don't you mean Obama's letting the BP oil spill is worse. @POTUS will handle this Democrat made crisis very well.  American's will stand behind him.
5384 2018-06-26 15:02:33 MMcDonald's starts at 14 an hour in west Texas, that's how we can tell the oil field doing well. End the welfare programs, we'll all have more money.

5387 2018-06-26 15:02:09 Peppermint essential oil!
5388 2018-06-26 15:02:02 Tribal land belongs to the natives. Oil companies threatening people isn’t the government telling us to leave. Your stupidity is shocking.
5389 2018-06-26 15:02:00 Keep selling the snake oil under the guise of being positive. I'm positive you're a fraud sir.
5390 2018-06-26 15:01:57 does asparagus serve any other purpose other than as a delivery system for olive oil and salt aka my two favorite things
5391 2018-06-26 15:01:56 Pull in for an oil change at 8:30...still waiting...about to lose my 
5392 2018-06-26 15:01:53 That power your seeing is just like all of the other polititions, Money, Power, Votes.  Still the same problems clouds our Nation.  Don't be deceived.  Dolly Pardon;  I'll always Love him, rather I'll Oil wells Love him.  Money Power Votes to hang on to that power.
5393 2018-06-26 15:01:43 Today our team booked 133600 in crude oil around 35 lots
5394 2018-06-26 15:01:37 promoting consumption of olive oil at 120 calories per tablespoon is careless. I would love to see financial disclosures of participants
5395 2018-06-26 15:01:28 Didn't he say celebrating sodomy was not Islamic? Lol. Wow. I find it hilarious that he follows you. Maybe we need to put him in front of a ulama so they can make a fatwa on his behavior due to his haram (disclaimer: I used wikipedia to get those terms).
5396 2018-06-26 15:01:28 Maybe I can get my oil change discounted
5397 2018-06-26 15:01:22 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.
5398 2018-06-26 15:01:19 kung alam ko lang na gagaguhin niya lang ako ngayon sana pinainom ko na lang sa kanya yung baby oil putangina 
5399 2018-06-26 15:01:18 Short answer: Bc they wouldn't give us their oil.
5400 2018-06-26 15:01:01 Setahu saya, yg ada evidence ialah fish oil, saffron dan antidepressants.  Tetapi kena rujuk juga dose yg diperlukan. Fish oil yg berkesan ialah yg ada higher dose of EPA (bukan DHA).  Kekuatan evidence adalah berdasarkan 2 kajian RCT (randomized controlled trial).
5401 2018-06-26 15:00:54 Muslim ban fits her (their) narrative
5402 2018-06-26 15:00:40 Success, of sorts. Enough for two cotton buds. Cotton seed meal for the feedlot? You may even get enough oil to shallow fry a chip. #everythingbutthesqueal even so , one hell of an effort this far south. Well done. #proofofconcept. 
5403 2018-06-26 15:00:33 No they have the right to build another factory outside the US. Called free enterprise-good business sense. If sales are down in the US, and they want to open in the marketplace abroad, why not? A lot of big corporations do it, including oil companies and car companies.

5407 2018-06-26 15:00:29 I'm eating rice+gochuchang+sesame oil kasi tinatamad akong initin yung ulam. Also, expired na ung gochuchang. Hahaha
5408 2018-06-26 15:00:28 It's laughable until your people are killed too!
5409 2018-06-26 15:00:27 But that’ll never happen because there’s no oil to motivate us to do that.
5410 2018-06-26 15:00:11 I've seen another one that has "oil change" there. Much harder to win!

5412 2018-06-26 15:00:09 @joerogan can you recommend a spot to buy cbd oil for pain?
5413 2018-06-26 15:00:05 They're just peddling their snake oil to the highest bidder

5417 2018-06-26 14:59:48 Excuse me? I’ve been a nurse for a guid few years and we should be paid more- after all -we’re in an oil rich nation..  as for bitter - I actually love my job. Even dealing with pessimistic arses like you 
5418 2018-06-26 14:59:43 Vitamin E oil is the shit too , dont sleep
5419 2018-06-26 14:59:36 Didn't say that. But it's undeniably the reason.

Nevermind the crown prince is claiming to take a hard stance against both the wahhabi clerics, fundamentalism and corruption.

But I agree they should be banned too. But they are friends with US and have a monopoly on oil.
5420 2018-06-26 14:59:31 Took my mom to get the oil changed in her car and it went up over the ramp and she screamed because she thought it was going through the hole
5421 2018-06-26 14:59:24 He told us last night, it's olive oil!

5423 2018-06-26 14:59:13 Hi Anna we are very excited about the launch of our new organic vegan seed snack. At least 5 seeds bound together with apple and no added sugar of any kind or oil. Delicious as a grab and go snack or with dips salads or soups. I can send you a press release.
5424 2018-06-26 14:59:11 Hope you enjoyed your wkend in UT.  Liked pix.  Is there a stock symbol equivalent for crude oil (like $TNX is for 10Yr Treasuries)?
5425 2018-06-26 14:59:01 ROSP please strengthen your Principles & Criteria and sanction non-compliant members.  Deforestation, endangered species extinction, massive climate emissions, and ongoing human rights abuses for palm oil are not “sustainable”.    #EURT2018 #sustainable #PalmOil #orangutans

5429 2018-06-26 14:58:44 Baby oil is the only that actually makes me skin soft forever. Coconut oil is for when I want my boobs to look extra. All these their oils do nothing for me

5431 2018-06-26 14:58:36 Seems @Watkin_Jones chose today to "vibro pile" at their former Wests Garage site in Cambridge. Perhaps it's the possible oil slick under our houses, but everything's sure a'wobbling and a'rattling.
5432 2018-06-26 14:58:35 mmmm.. ok.. i think i was using organ oil for a second.. just been using standard products from the sop lately.. shea moisture and cantu products.. but the natural ting is probably better. We talking regular ol olive oil yeh??
5433 2018-06-26 14:58:35 おつありっぽい？
5434 2018-06-26 14:58:29 *True Enough. To compare which groups benefitted from subsidies, we need 2 agree on what constitutes a “Subsidy.” Govt’s use various “Subsidies” 2 incent, or Encourage Investment in areas targeted 4 Growth & Development. Subsidies HAVE Benefitted Oil & Gas. @CBCPolitics @CTVNews
5435 2018-06-26 14:58:20 Rape to population ratio in UK is 80 & in U.S its 30 times of India

But somehow India is still worst than Saudi, Iran etc for womaaaan

Seems the recent survey is nothing but plain propaganda by  vicisous outlets funded by oil money to defame India at the international stage.
5436 2018-06-26 14:58:17 I love @TrustTheBum skin care products, and love the hair oil, but for whatever reason their dry shampoo doesn’t help my hair AT ALL. It only makes it greasier - and I’m a longtime user of dry shampoo with my fine blonde hair. 
5437 2018-06-26 14:58:14 @GreenMotion what's the damage charge for used brake pads and dirtier oil? Your policy is no assumption of wear and tear on short term rentals.
5438 2018-06-26 14:58:04 Parang ang naaalala ko lang na ginawa ko sa ilags ay yung paghingi ko ng baby oil nung nakitulog ako sa inyo HAHAHAHAHA

5442 2018-06-26 14:57:32 The third cannabinoid receptor they just found appears in other organs and oddly enough, in tumors. If a cannabinoid receptor is built into tumors, this makes so much sense how we can destroy tumors with a cannabis oil regimen
5443 2018-06-26 14:57:30 I've been taking my 2011 Dodge Nitro to the same dealership for oil change regularly. I was told this time that my oil pan is stripped and I need a new oil pan. The cost is $1,175.00 and the Gasket is $60.00. Labor not included. I'm told labor could cost $750.00 or more. My fault
5444 2018-06-26 14:57:17 I can't believe there is someone who doesn’t love to eat Grape leaves with oil...
5445 2018-06-26 14:57:13 Weakened? He is stronger now and has cut off oil from two ports going to the Tripoli NOC. He can drive a hard bargain just like Jadhran did.

5447 2018-06-26 14:57:10 Today, oil prices hit $75 a barrel, their highest level since November 2014 after US President Donald Trump called the Iran nuclear deal "insane" adding to fears the US could impose further sanctions on the nation.
5448 2018-06-26 14:57:09 I’m going to use butter instead of vegetable oil for now on when i bake cakes ... like as soon as i bit into that cake it melted in my mouth

5450 2018-06-26 14:57:01 I'm currently on Accutane for my acne (PCOS) I was told to apply sunscreen.

5461 2018-06-26 14:55:41 The cause of the forest fire this time in sacrament is that a 22y/o boy spilled oil a little bit of oil(3.64cc) when exchanging lighter oil a few days ago, two and a half days later, another boys sitting in the same place there, he put out the fire of the cigarette with his foot.

5484 2018-06-26 14:53:57 Neel, Fed can indeed hit 2% if they truly wanted to by revaluing the price of #gold in USD terms. Say, $1,450 USD. Be a buyer at $1,448 & a seller at $1,455.
Everything else will auto-adjust. Oil/gold ratio will reset higher, so will commodities

5485 2018-06-26 14:53:41 So companies can be free to fuck their workers as royally as they did in the 1890's? I'm pretty sure that's when Trump thinks America was great, when the country was run by unregulated steel, oil and real estate barons. His dad's time.
5486 2018-06-26 14:53:31 As a former Asian Development Bank consultant I’ve seen firsthand the biodiversity loss engendered by oil palm plantations in Indonesia. Is @RSPOtweets certified “sustainable” palm oil truly sustainable? If you think ecological violations are sustainable then yes. #EURT2018

5493 2018-06-26 14:52:50 Even if it was disbanded it would just be broken into smaller subcontractors. Not that she cares. Just so long as she gets her "victory." Thinking long term is secondary to short term goals where the left is sometimes concerned.

5495 2018-06-26 14:52:44 When US sanctions were placed on Iran in 2012 [China India Japan & SKorea] were given a waiver requiring them to reduce their business w Iran by 20% each 6 mos rather than halt trade immediately. The Asian oil buyers are less likely to receive a similar waiver frm the Trump admin
5496 2018-06-26 14:52:37 1) Its not a Muslim Ban. 2) Women Rights institute advocating an Abrahamic religion is like Polar Bears advocating oil drilling

5501 2018-06-26 14:52:20 I'm in CA, and the feds recently decided that my $640 a month Social Security is TOO MUCH INCOME to qualify for food stamps.  I recommend putting some of your budget in a seed bank and put in a case of olive oil.
5502 2018-06-26 14:52:18 Over ripe plantain that will go & soak oil, nonsense.

5505 2018-06-26 14:52:05 Yeah. I'm atheist, but I do like the symbolism of prayer helping when you've got yourself in a sticky spot. It's oil change on another one I've seen, which stops you doing that one thing all the time to "win".

5542 2018-06-26 14:49:07 There were lots of issues that caused the economic crisis, the oil crisis of the early 70's was the one that crippled us.

5655 2018-06-26 14:38:08 From what we can see, Iran is sole provider of crude oil, so you probably might want to double that $ number.
5656 2018-06-26 14:38:05 Saudia Arabia NOT on ban....hmmm wonder why ?? Can it be from the BIG Oil and BIG money interest ??

5658 2018-06-26 14:37:55 try st ives apricot scrub then use witch hazel afterwards to tone + cleanse skin. also if you wanna really glow, use the aloe vera PLANT (not fake ass products) from oublix every night on your face. smash, add tea tree oil, leave on for 10 mins, wash off.

5660 2018-06-26 14:36:56 If Canada, or anyone else, burns the 173 Billion barrels of oil locked in the Tarsands, it would use up 30% of the remaining GLOBAL carbon budget if we are to prevent global warming going to 2 degrees. Canada has less than 1/2 of 1% of world population. Morally ok? No.

5698 2018-06-26 14:33:14 It could be a negotiating tactic to get a better deal for the east but if it is it is dangerous. However, the Tripoli NOC will not get access to Gulf of SIrte oil unless it makes a deal. The GNA has no force to drive Haftar out or at least wont try it.

5703 2018-06-26 14:32:54 You’re right. I don’t think there are any truly sovereign nations though. The economic system proves that. Look at the oil crisis of the mid-70s - the West was practically held hostage. We rely on friendly oil-producers just to drive & keep warm.

The southern countries would slip further and further behind. Having your own currency, that you can devalue at will, does not weigh up to the rising costs of importing almost everything except olive oil. They knew what they were getting into. Varoufakis knows it.

5811 2018-06-26 14:24:30 Between the end of the war & that year we were in consistent relevant economic decline vs Germany, France, Japan, USSR & USA

Every year we contracted our reach globally & our economy was weakened time after time

Easy to forget how much oil boom and Big Bang saved U.K. economy
5812 2018-06-26 14:24:29 "Alberta is doing bad!"
"Actually AB is doing well."
"Calgary isn't doing as well!"
"But the rest of AB is, and Calgary was oil central."
"DAMNED NDP!!!"

Apparently Calgary IS Alberta, and the NDP caused the oil crash and lack of savings from the oil boom.

5916 2018-06-26 14:14:41 $GE is spinning off its #healthcare division and exiting its $BHGE stake. At the time of the latter $31.7bn deal's close a year ago, both companies called their partnership the "World’s First and Only Fullstream Oil and Gas Company"

5928 2018-06-26 14:13:37 Transcendental meditation, or TM, is very helpful. 

Along w/ TM there is an app called Headspace which is a life saver. 

Also there are “binaural beats” you can youtube for stress

Then there’s CBD oil, essential oils, and blue blocking glasses

And sex lol. That helps too haha

The hate for #GNA & its inaptitude doesn't mean this move will not bear catastrophic results on the long-term. The only game-changer is who has the #oil card.

5941 2018-06-26 14:12:50 Its high time the cycle swings back. Some of the best workers in the country are in the oil patch and much of the country forgets how important these skills are for the country and its economic growth.
5942 2018-06-26 14:12:48 Do you think it all went to pot in one year?
You went through over a decade of deindustrialisation and stagnation, and then the global oil crisis.
Sure the 3 day week was introduced in 1973.

I sort of do know this stuff, though far from an expert
5943 2018-06-26 14:12:26 Simple economics. Oil & coal are far cheaper and far more efficient.

Tax cuts in a good economy makes no sense all the added revenue could fund programs start on deficits 
Stripping regulations on water air trying to drill for oil in pristine lands
Banking protections for consumers  Cutting programs the healthcare mess

5968 2018-06-26 14:10:19 In all honesty, the development of the Nigerian Oil and Gas sector is poorly managed. What's the progress with Brass LNG as well as Olokonla LNG? Great money spinners if well developed.

5993 2018-06-26 14:08:32 I agree. Luckily, this spill is synthetic mud and not oil and gas like the Gulf in 2010. That spill definitely affected a larger area and killed many organisms by polluting the water. In NS, the spill is changing the structure of the seabed and those habitats mostly by the rig

6050 2018-06-26 14:02:08 I think opposite. I think Haftar and LNA just got more popular and will get more so. People need some resolve some real decisions to change the rules of the game rather than kick the can forward. Haftar just did that. The GNA will not be able to mobilise anyone to fight for oil

6149 2018-06-26 13:51:32 Understood, but the removal of palm oil from the EU biofuels industry will ensure the raw product is directed elsewhere, without certification, lower prices in turn increasing demand from outside of the EU, raise EU demand for other vegoils, etc. - a complex dynamic
6150 2018-06-26 13:51:30 Is "sustainable" palm oil (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil - @RSPOtweets)  truly sustainable? If you think #landgrabbing is sustainable then yes.  This is 2018, and we've known of this problem for decades.  Time for significant, meaningful change!

6161 2018-06-26 13:50:13 That is true, and that is Quebec’s choice to say no to the pipeline if they oppose oil development for ethical reasons.  But how can they also choose to say yes to money from oil development in other provinces?
6162 2018-06-26 13:50:12 HomeOwner Tip
Getting Tiles Clean
For squeaky-clean porcelain tiles, sweep and vacuum twice a week. Soak with water-vinegar mixture for 5-10 minutes once a month for a deep clean and scrub with a soft bristled brush. Always avoid bleach, wax oil based cleansers and hard scrubber
6163 2018-06-26 13:50:05 No. Next question.  Is the Republican Party compromised by dirty, Russian oil money? TBD
6164 2018-06-26 13:50:01 Depends on the interpretation. For example some versions of Islam like Salafistm are pretty similar to White Supremacy.

It just so happens that Salafism is promoted by countries like Saudi Arabia that have endless amounts of oil money to promote it.

6191 2018-06-26 13:46:55 I think the potential for abuse is probably higher, because controlling the price of a commodity (transport, oil, telecom) is quite different these companies have the market knowledge to disrupt multiple industries - consumer and non-consumer.
6192 2018-06-26 13:46:53 Bout as honest as a snake oil salesman

6194 2018-06-26 13:46:42 As desperate as we are for peace, he uses this to his advantage and gets to control our oil production for an undisclosed period. Whether at peace or at war, we the people of #SouthSudan are the ultimate losers.

6199 2018-06-26 13:46:23 Agree that sustained corrupt & inefficient governments who didn't use oil income to diversify sources of production of wealth are major cause of poverty. However, uncontrolled birthrate is leading to overpopulation and more poor people. People in 1991=90 million, today 190m
6200 2018-06-26 13:46:15 do you do oil changes
6201 2018-06-26 13:46:12 Oil changes with the change of  season. Tip is usually no less than 20%.  If the wait service was exceptionally poor, it’s 15%. If the service was great it’s 25%.

6205 2018-06-26 13:45:46 Stir together 3 pints ham with 11 lbs donuts. Mix in Olive Oil. Freeze for 9 hours. Serve with a nice chianti.
6206 2018-06-26 13:45:34 This totally contradicts the fact that the government has marijuana as a schedule one drug meaning it serves no medical purpose. It’s time to Reschedule marijuana. Also why not give people pure cannabis oil instead turning it into a drug. Pain Patients could use this too
6207 2018-06-26 13:45:30 I change my oil ever 6 months or so (usually sooner) and I tip no less then 5-6 bucks, but average around 9
6208 2018-06-26 13:45:20 actually, even for federal elections, states determine their own ballot access laws. traditionally, it's been pushed as a states rights issue, but used to ensure that the two-party dominance is preserved. this is a new twist on its implementation, but a legal one.

6217 2018-06-26 13:44:46 The Libyan National Army (LNA) has handed the oil ports of Ras Lanuf and Es Sider to the Benghazi NOC. This means oil exports could come to a halt as a 2016 UN Security Council resolution hands control of #Libya’s all facilities to the Tripoli NOC.

6232 2018-06-26 13:42:57 Spicy things are usually fat soluble, hence why milk should help (skim wouldn’t)... olive oil should help. Also, spicy things are almost always acids, so add baking soda to your soap wash after any fat you try.

6238 2018-06-26 13:42:17 I try not to wash so much, because that would wash off all my natural oil and my scalp will produce more oil.

6298 2018-06-26 13:37:26 The profound question is why so many people continue to support you even though you have sold out our country to Russia, North Korea, and big oil.  You are a traitor, and a servant of the Anti-Christ.
6299 2018-06-26 13:37:15 Are you committing to an oil free lifestyle? If so, your hashtags are appropriate, if not I’d suggest some self reflection.
6300 2018-06-26 13:37:14 Great! My younger sister has MS & cannibus oil has been an amazing pain relief for her. After years of prescription drugs like Lyrica that helped but had terrible side effects & was killing her liver she tried cannibus oil. In her own words "it was like a miracle!"

6351 2018-06-26 13:32:53 There’s millions of barrels of oil coming into US from Canada. Just a thought. Zero going the other way. Re dairy products let’s pay farmers full price and distribute it to the poor and homeless. Saves 270% tariff into Canada.

Too bad that it no longer features four car-length dome coaches, but still a great train traversing gorgeous Northern Prairies (with oil fracking wells added) & Pacific Northwest!

6362 2018-06-26 13:31:38 I've had one of those for a few years, fair warning, if you put any heavy oil in them (IE Olive or Vegetable) they clog up pretty fast. Use Safflower or Sunflower oils for best results. If it does clog, soak the nozzle in soapy hot water for a while.

6402 2018-06-26 13:27:42 Get a hybrid vehicle, go solar, wind for energy. Yet we still need only 50% of the current oil to continue for 30-50 years until we NO longer need fossil fuels.

6469 2018-06-26 13:21:11 The problem with Scottish independence for Westminster isnt just about oil , or being caught with their hand in the till for hundreds of years , its that Scotland will still remain a neighbour - and also become a new competitor.

So much for capitalism , open markets.
6470 2018-06-26 13:21:09 Stress affects hormone levels so that might cause acne. Just be sure to keep your face clean and use hypoallergenic products! If you're worried about hyperpigmentation, look into cica cream or tamanu oil (if not allergic to nuts). I used both to control my acne discoloration.

6491 2018-06-26 13:19:03 With all due respect, i wouldn't call it a conspiracy but a chain of geopolitical and economical interests (circling around regional control, natural gas, oil, raw materials etc) which make official France, Britain and US deaf and dumb on the Ambazonia issue.

6596 2018-06-26 13:07:04 Real issue for SS and S should be Khartoum’s insertion of talk about oil in the midst of a discussion about life or death in South Sudan! If Juba signs on to any Khartoum-sponsored deal in the name of increased oil production, we must b aware that we might end up with debt
6597 2018-06-26 13:06:34 i'm filipino and in a restaurant here (mang inasal) , we add chicken oil which looks like orange liquid food coloring to our rice. it may have been chicken oil instead of orange food color?

6694 2018-06-26 12:56:16 Greater liquidity in #Sudan and #SouthSudan's economy is a macroeconomic necessity. The most obvious way to secure this is increased oil production, this requires bi-lateral arrangements. Given the context, these arrangements are directly related to South Sudan's conflict.

6907 2018-06-26 12:33:38 What? They just signed a multi Billion $ gas-exporting deal with Egypt, have great trade relations with Jordan, and are totally intertwined with Turky, albeit Erdogan’s populism. Not to mention clandestine imports of Iraqi-Kurdish oil. Relations have never been better.
6908 2018-06-26 12:33:36 Nigeria has a world class steel factory yet we import majority of our steel. We have crude oil and refineries yet we import majority of our petroleum products. Being a one eyed man in the land of the blind is no success at all. #povertymentality destroy nations.

6939 2018-06-26 12:29:15 Both hold #oil hostage to advance an agenda, personal or political. It's not about "#Libya". It's too early to speak about consistency; accountability or responsibility.

7000 2018-06-26 12:20:13 Made a really yummy neck and back rub for myself. Coconut oil, peppermint, rosemary, lavender, chamomile and CBD oil. I store it in a cold place and just use it when I need it which is a lot right now

7004 2018-06-26 12:18:50 Yes. If halting of #oil exports is protracted as a result and we witness a #Jodhran-like effect w/ even higher inflation & economic crisis, the #LNA's rep will sink. To many, #Haftar is already polarizing and the actions of his force questionable. That would seal that perception.
7005 2018-06-26 12:18:50 Interesting. I just wonder what other refineries will do.

Remember, most of the sanctions era took place amidst an oil surplus, and now we're in deficit. I just think there must be purchasers willing to use non-US banks, insurers etc. for 1% of the world's supply.
7006 2018-06-26 12:18:27 It's 2018 , it's no longer about working hard , it's about working smart. The banking sector is shrinking , the oil sector isn't what it used to be . Our aviation sector at the very best is competing with what you see in a Harry Potter movie.

Since 2014, international oil prices have been at a historic low. Any other government, with the barest of concern for its people, would have passed on the benefit to the public by reducing the prices of petrol and diesel.

NATGAS close to tagging 20MA=resist & pulls back. On 1D chart MUST correct lower & tag 200 or 50 MAs to complete a proper correction.
USD 1H setting up to move higher. GOLD low
7017 2018-06-26 12:16:54 I prefer using my oil cleanser cause I'm lazy I just wanna slap rub and rinse 
7018 2018-06-26 12:16:53 Yeah but where else is the point they r trying to make.. 
Apparently Jabhran take over and loss of Oil ports has depend the east vs west narrative because they say the funding for it was provided by NOC funds

7032 2018-06-26 12:15:52 @loosewomen cannabis oil helps so many people and needs to be legalised for medical purposes. My husband has grade 4 brain cancer and was only given 18months at most. That was in 2015.   It may not be a cure, but I definitely improves Quality of live for the seriously ill.
7033 2018-06-26 12:15:41 I also think Haftir’s aim may very likely be to hold oil hostage - seems very difficult to imagine how eastern NOC can market oil - not to mention use that to pay the massive state salary bill across the country

7068 2018-06-26 12:11:39 I'm inclined to compare it to oil, as others do. It's just as valuable when you have it lying around (as long as people want it) as it is when put to industrial use. We could just as readily trade barrels of oil as a currency...and so $USD went proxy for oil in '74

7125 2018-06-26 12:01:32 We have no oil fund-we made different choices and spent the oil revenue. We already get the Geographical Revenue of all North Sea extraction already and also that from our food and drink exports.

Still waiting for any kind of a case for Indy...

7128 2018-06-26 12:01:10 @AngiTaylorKISS @fredonair lavender essential oil would work! Young Living has a doggie line too!
7129 2018-06-26 12:01:03 It's so hard. It's hidden away in so many products! I do check labels and return to products that I know are palm oil free, plus I use the @CheyenneMtnZoo shopping guides to help. Definitely tricky though.
7130 2018-06-26 12:00:48 I am using $45 oil.. levels
7131 2018-06-26 12:00:47 One day I will make you homemade crisps with sesame oil and salt and pepper and oregano, hot and straight out of the frying pan, and then you’ll never @ me with your Doritos folderol again.

7134 2018-06-26 12:00:10 (ー'`ー;)???
7135 2018-06-26 11:59:59 Thank you for this. It's good that efforts are being made to improve the situation but other oil-producing crops not grown on land that has to be cleared of rain forest first are surely less destructive overall, and the lives of many oil palm workers look pretty miserable to me.
7136 2018-06-26 11:59:58 Yep, subsidies to the oil industry are tax breaks, while tax breaks for renewables are subsidies.

7142 2018-06-26 11:58:56 I mean think of the Oil Spill in the gulf, we had proof that they weren't cleaning it up correctly and also that it wasn't safe. They were just hiding the oil under more sand to make it look like they cleaned it up.

7144 2018-06-26 11:58:43 In ten years, the price of OIL will be ZERO!
7145 2018-06-26 11:58:39 To be fair I have had a black background for quite some time. I remember back in my first year at uni I saw I could change the lab PC backgrounds so I changed all the pc backgrounds including the projector to ainsley harriot pouring oil into a pan. Tutor was amused lol.
7146 2018-06-26 11:58:30 Or they will say, screw it. We can grow our own food, build our own cars and we have plenty of oil to not use the US’s.

7154 2018-06-26 11:56:39 Oil has been getting subsidies since decades before the solar industry even existed, they still do.  So if subsidies are horrible in the solar industry, are they equally bad in oil?

7162 2018-06-26 11:55:31 Oil fell on June 25 as investors prepared for an extra 1 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil to hit the markets after OPEC agreed to raise production and as U.S. equity markets slipped on trade war fears.

7174 2018-06-26 11:53:37 @Nissan @NissanUSA they said they had JUST taken my car in. It made me late for work. Oil changes don't take 2 hours. Then they pull it into the garage & there's white scrapes all over the front of it. They were very noticeable & not there before.
7175 2018-06-26 11:53:34 Obama imprisoned the Hammonds and the @BundyRanch good Christian men!  Over their own land!  Obama FBI murdered Mr Finicum spokesman for the Bundy's and the Hammonds!
7176 2018-06-26 11:53:24 Agree completely. Big oil companies are already making the pivot to become big energy companies and their capital, technology, project management, etc are important to the energy transition process. Re-fighting old battles is a waste of time and resources.

7224 2018-06-26 11:46:38 @iramdaskadam Who will save the trees cut 2 use paper instead of plastic? Destruction of environment by destroying trees is worse than rationalising use of plastic! Some oil us have a year's supply of garbage bags, diapers, ziplock bags, shrink-wrap because they r good!

7270 2018-06-26 11:38:32 They won't find anything. They're too lazy to. Oil is free money.
Instead, they'll tax the living daylight out of us and still belch in our faces from the resulting flatulence of their embezzlement.
7271 2018-06-26 11:38:31 @royalenfield there is only Royal in your name ...no royal in treating your customer...

7275 2018-06-26 11:38:05 My recipe for today....grill both sides. Spray liberally with oil and watch the lobster style creation unfold.

7280 2018-06-26 11:36:43 Mate I sat in the garden with olive oil plastered all over es the other week and I wouldn't bloody tan never mind burn
7281 2018-06-26 11:36:38 TIL: Apparently mango is in the same botanical family as poison ivy. The peel and sap from mango contain the same oil, urushiol, that causes a similar autoimmune response caused by its 3 shiny-leafed relative.

7285 2018-06-26 11:35:53 Try spicing it up with mustard, garlic, peppers or rosemary and thyme. I use avocado oil in my mayo. So glad I found a simple video on YouTube on how to make it quickly with a immersion blender.
7286 2018-06-26 11:35:47 Simple solution to falklands. Let argentina have the oil on the proviso islander's can keep british nationality if they want. It was a fight for freedom after all. Nothing to do with that offshore oil & thatcher wanting to win an election(she was on her knees at the time) @LBC
7287 2018-06-26 11:35:47 Or Macron could be really sneaky smart putting oil on the fire to get Trump to really punish Germany, since France is already knee deep in a trade deficit themselves and barely have any exchanges with the US. Let's not be too stereotypical.
7288 2018-06-26 11:35:47 Is #deforestation truly sustainable @RSPOtweets? No? Then why certify it? Close the loophole now so companies like Whole Earth stop making it look like they’re being green when using palm oil in their peanut butter #EURT2018 #wholeearthpeanutbutter @wholeearthfoods

7302 2018-06-26 11:32:34  One of our favorite olive oil / balsamic pairings is our Greek Seasonings oil with our Zesty Lemon balsamic. This combination truly exemplifies a classic pairing where neither ingredient is overshadowed by the other.

They sell out for it, knowing full well that nukes in the hands of the mullahs is never going to amount to anything good. Appeasing the wolf
7324 2018-06-26 11:28:08 Where is the UN and Western powers that keep preaching human rights to us nonstop from their pedestal ?? 
I guess their moral criteria for intervention doesnt apply here because Myanmar is neither an oil producer nor a threat to Israel.

7346 2018-06-26 11:25:11 My writing got sloppy there I have to admit.  I used Quebec at times to mean the Government of Quebec and the people of Quebec.  The Government’s not buying the oil, but the Government certainly opposed the pipeline and bans development of oil and gas

7379 2018-06-26 11:21:01 Because as individuals, we're all out here with our spherical cows making rational choices with money. We could have demanded much better solutions, but the oil companies are powerless to stop us from depending on their business model. We're rational actors acting rationally.
7380 2018-06-26 11:20:55 But the reason it is an equalization issue is that Quebec made a big show of not developing their oil and gas and even blocked a pipeline.  They’re ethically opposed.  In that case, equalization should be reworked so that oil and gas is excluded

7399 2018-06-26 11:17:24 After hearing from my fellow #Canadians their "opinion" on oil subsidies I decided to take a few moments to explore their arguments.  I did this search very quickly and only listed a couple of the dozens of sites regarding subsidies. You can do your own research from here..

7407 2018-06-26 11:15:57 This may be my new favorite quote of all time. By President Thomas S. Monson:

"God left the world unfinished for man to work his skill upon. He left the electricity in the cloud, the oil in the earth. He left the rivers unbridged and the forests unfelled and the cities unbuilt.

7472 2018-06-26 11:05:01 The increased oil price has influenced the inflation rate, but not because consumers typically buy barrels of oil.

7517 2018-06-26 10:58:54 Some people ask: why was it in the interest of the EU and NATO to de-stabilise #Libya and, more importantly, to keep its Western region de-stabilized seven years after the ousting of Qaddafi? Quite simply, oil reservers were previously nationalised, now they’re easier to exploit.

7527 2018-06-26 10:56:45 I’m arguing that Quebec STOPPED the pipeline, which PREVENTS refiners from buying the oil.  I’m not saying Quebec buys the oil.
7528 2018-06-26 10:56:40 In the case of Nigeria, it's the foreign oil money propping up super-corrupt regimes - actually, true for most of Africa.  Only countries that are okay are one that don't have a natural resource to be exploited, therefore do not get "colonised".

7544 2018-06-26 10:51:22 That was the difference. It was managed decline and falling wages under Callaghan. Radical destruction under Thatcher. UK had oil coming onshore at a fair rate then, taxation revenue could have been used to invest for the future.
7545 2018-06-26 10:51:22 thank you so much!! tbh it's less of a love for oil paints and portraits and realism and more of a love for passing my class

7577 2018-06-26 10:47:11 I subscribe to an argument by @tundeleye that Nigeria is too mineral rich for oil market to drag the treasury down for too long. If there is no more oil, our elite would find something else to be exploit just like the British did. It will take generations to mine Nigeria dry.
7578 2018-06-26 10:47:10 Mobil 1 is a PAO oil. Castrol, Valvoline, Pennsoil, and the rest are all hydrocracked petroleum oils with synthetic written on the bottles! They are not a real synthetic oil.
7579 2018-06-26 10:47:09 It's literally soapy water with some oil in it.
7580 2018-06-26 10:47:09 Totally agree and I'm not letting that slide. 

However, there are billionaires who are much bigger threats than Musk; I.E Beezos, Koch Bros, Banking Families, Oil Tycoons, etc who do far more damage than Musk's union busting and spy satellites which is why I agreed w/ WATL.

7593 2018-06-26 10:44:45 After a tough day in the markets yesterday due to tariffs and trade issues, today is a little more hopeful. US stock futures are off 0.2% with Europe higher and Asia mixed.  Gold is $1,259 with oil at $67.88. Time for some traction.

7600 2018-06-26 10:41:38 Maybe, tax bill changed structure. Mis expectations leads to mis pricing. Causing the backward looking mean to include that previous mispricing. Making mean reversion in this case difficult. Further their tie to oil and treasuries make the S and P less of correlated benchmark.IMO

7814 2018-06-26 09:59:35 no problem. Putting lavender oil in the humidifier can help a lot too w/ headaches and anxiety.
7815 2018-06-26 09:59:30 bring it on.

7818 2018-06-26 09:58:43 So true!!! Mas kumapal brows ko sa aloe vera kesa sa castor oil.

7822 2018-06-26 09:58:25 Since appearing on Queer Eye my life has transformed: I have a new found confidence, my house looks amazing and my relationship is going from strength to strength, also thanks to Antoni I’ve realised that sunflower oil is often a good alternative to olive oil

7824 2018-06-26 09:58:00 Rub castor oil or jasmine oil on it
7825 2018-06-26 09:57:57 Little olive oil and some serious heat, like 500° and mmmmmmmmm guud. 
7826 2018-06-26 09:57:45 Are you that thick that you think the N.Sea oil can maintain your country?Scotland has a GDP deficiency three times that of the rest of the UK. You can’t spend what you don’t have chap!
7827 2018-06-26 09:57:33 ... or what our laws and history are. That said, there’s also (clearly) a ton of citizens that don’t either (as a gov’t teacher I’ve known that forever). The catch? The people that voted for him vote in droves as they’ve bought the snake oil- in 55 gallon drums apparently.
7828 2018-06-26 09:57:27 Norway has a high GDP per capita & extensive state welfare due to having a small population relative to its oil production 
7829 2018-06-26 09:57:23 Olives are repulsive and their only place on earth is to make oil.
7830 2018-06-26 09:57:14 So, the oil producers have reached some sort of agreement. The figure was expected to be more than 1mbpd (the production increase) but analysts are assuming it will settle somewhere between 600,000 bpd to 800,000bpd. Hence, the recent price hike. WTI rallied more than 4%.
7831 2018-06-26 09:56:38 So annoying. Big Oil loves to point out that wind doesn't always blow and sun doesn't always shine, so they have to kill off renewable projects like this. Shameful lack of leadership by our government.
7832 2018-06-26 09:56:25 Lmaooooo.. Baby, use anointing oil plis

7836 2018-06-26 09:54:28 That's exactly what I see. Desperation. 

They were fooled by the snake oil salesmen, and don't want to admit it. Yet, they are lining up for more snake oil.

7838 2018-06-26 09:54:21 The social model says that it's because there bumps in the path that make it difficult for SEN and D 
The social model of society is supposed to put the oil into society to make things run smoother for EVERYONE, not just the able!
7839 2018-06-26 09:54:05 Wait, where do we (we as in the human race that consume vegatable oils) grow vegetable oils if not on land that was once Forest? Is Canola oil grown in Brazil better?

7844 2018-06-26 09:52:46 Govt. chose to increase central excise taxes (by over 200% on petrol and over 400% on diesel) to make oil costlier than it has ever been, and collected over Rs 10 lakh crore by way of this cruel exercise in unjust enrichment.

7854 2018-06-26 09:51:10 Leave the oil in the ground, watch the neighbor benefit from theirs. Take it from the ground, watch the vultures steal the revenues. Maybe it sh'ld be left alone until the regime expires. I don't see anything good coming from it in the current context.
@pbusharizi @newvisionwire
7855 2018-06-26 09:50:20 We can give the oil & gas industry unfettered access to all the oil & gas on federal lands and it still wouldn’t reduce energy cost or enrich the treasury enough to reduce our taxes. It’s a giveaway plain and simple.
7856 2018-06-26 09:50:15 This might be in the form of service, such as three free oil changes in a year with the purchase of a motorcycle. Your packaging might be slightly larger, which brings increased quantity. Your location might be unique and easily accessible.(2)

8096 2018-06-26 08:59:36 East #Libya NOC is not legally authorized to sell oil, and Hiftar knows this well. This is clearly a political maneuver / arm-twisting to score certain points against GNA or CBL
8097 2018-06-26 08:59:34 I agree and I do find the WD40 Chain wax very useful in winter, I've used kerosene, and I also found that gearbox oil is pretty good. But I have just found something that I might be switching over too is amazing stuff but that's all I'm going to say at the moment

8107 2018-06-26 08:56:55 Mustafa Sanallah’s statement did not credit the sacrifices of the LNA soldiers who gave their lives to recapture the oil terminals from Jadhran. He should’ve distinguished between the current conflict with Hiftar and the LNA

I want science. Their model for greenhouse effect drastically exaggerates the CO2 contribution and ignores the solar cycle

They use it to tax the poor and give to the rich

8132 2018-06-26 08:49:41 That’s great news. Two questions though, if you have a mo?

1. How do you define ‘responsibility sourced’?

2. What proportion of the palm oil you currently use in your products is ‘responsibly sourced’?
8133 2018-06-26 08:49:18 The price of oil gave ground. The Brent barrel fell by -1.09% and the WTI barrel by -0.19%.

8144 2018-06-26 08:46:34 Govt. chose to increase central excise taxes (by over 200% on petrol and over 400% on diesel) to make oil costlier than it has ever been, and collected over Rs 10 lakh crore by way of this cruel exercise in unjust enrichment.

8238 2018-06-26 08:27:09 Not really, I just get the pure oil and mix it with baby oil, it's very potent, so a bit of practice will help you get the ratio that works for you.

8285 2018-06-26 08:18:05 I swear their whole story is a trip, they found an oil field near their farm in Saudi Arabia and became millionaires, so when they came to France for leisure they started to waste their money on everything and anything, sadly for them the luggage room isn't well isolated :/

8338 2018-06-26 08:07:13 Don't think the pattern fits the timing - oil rose pretty steadily from 2004 through to 2014 (with volatility both ways in 2008-2009). Agree it's a tailwind from 2014 but not as big a delta as used to be and factors in the other direction eg also weaker sterling from 2014 onwards
8339 2018-06-26 08:06:58 You don't see anything wrong with the fact that countries that are involved in wars are all rich in minerals and/or oil, and it's all supervised by white people?
Or that the most developed countries have the least amount of minerals and no oil?

8363 2018-06-26 08:02:45 That ermine-gland oil in that.
8364 2018-06-26 08:02:23 And what do you think that means for US Oil Companies and Workers?
8365 2018-06-26 08:01:54 Thank you for educating us all on these strains of Cannabis. Is there a huge difference between flower and oil. Florida is still fighting for actual weed we voted 4. Our dispensaries are limited to mostly vapes. Appreciate your help. #LegalizeIt #VoteBlue
8366 2018-06-26 08:01:20 I think we forget to teach one thing when we advise people to start with weight lose..and that is stretch marks...so I think, the minute you start that journey, you immediately buy your tissue oil,and mix it up with your daily body lotion..and apply it every single day of ur life
8367 2018-06-26 08:01:17 It’s so hot in my room my coconut oil has melted and I’m basically pouring a jar of oil n getting it everywhere
8368 2018-06-26 08:01:15 So! More airport capacity as oil starts to run out & planes won't be able to get fuel and fly.
Enjoy it Heathrow. You'll be fields one day.
8369 2018-06-26 08:00:59 Avon do this dry oil spray it's called skin so soft- think they still do it. The mozzys don't like it apparently. I'd maybe ring the doctors if the bite is rock hard maybe they might suggest antihistamines? X
8370 2018-06-26 08:00:29 They look too nice to blitz ....  a tomato salad , few basil leaves, good olive oil, drizzle of sherry vinegar, capers maybe?   #whosaidsaladcreamcomeonownup?

8382 2018-06-26 07:56:57 Parliamentary democracy is a rare anomaly that only functions in few lands, within the recent material abundance of the oil age. After the loss of a few fragile structures and networks, you will see these countries return to warlordism.

8385 2018-06-26 07:56:33 I remember when Bill Clinton ran for office. Being in a family that the men love old cars & are always building and restoring classics..They were excited for Clinton thinking he seemed like the kind of guy to leave oil stains on the white house driveway.

8387 2018-06-26 07:55:47 I just rinse it real well and use this argan oil conditioner and then I've been trying various de-frizzers/relaxers with very mixed results so far
8388 2018-06-26 07:55:43 It happens with new ones. Apply lil bit of coconut oil in your feet on those places so that it doesn’t hurt. Once it gets smoothed with enough use, it’ll be fine

8391 2018-06-26 07:55:26 Burning oil as well as the gigantic mining operations are a huge safety issue! The creation of deadly viruses for the purpose of biological warefare, is a control of infectious disease issue. You don't care about anything that's a real threat to public health and safety.

8393 2018-06-26 07:54:53 Cleansing oil is better
8394 2018-06-26 07:54:39 Have the EU been successful at persuading the US, China, Russia and the likes of Saudi Arabia to dramatic reductions in oil usage and production? Have they agreed to marked reductions in CO2 emissions? No. There are good reasons to be in the EU but that isn't a convincing one.
8395 2018-06-26 07:54:34 Which NZ owned oil or gas companies does it represent?
8396 2018-06-26 07:54:21 I just realized I probably have oily skin cause a lot of my skincare has sulfates in it that further strip natural sebum from the skin which causes more oil to produce 
8397 2018-06-26 07:54:01 Is this so instead of piping our oil down south they can fly it down now ross?
8398 2018-06-26 07:53:54 The only reason why the US$ has not acquired junk status is the petro$

8414 2018-06-26 07:49:05 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.

8479 2018-06-26 07:36:40 Yip I’m afraid the oil is too much for your skin. Are you using a toner? An inexpensive way is pure witch hazel (no alcohol) and use that just until things calm down, also good old aloe gel will help which I think most of us have lying around. Needs to be a gel not a cream though

8505 2018-06-26 07:30:46 They often happen when a product with too much oil gets trapped under the skin. Or weirdly what I find is if I shower with makeup on or an oil based product I sometimes get them, the heat opens the pores and allows the oil to penetrate, with the icy air those pores close quickly
8506 2018-06-26 07:30:44 I have no problem with heavy industrial investments in mining, but this should be done on our terms, like how it is with the Arabs & oil.

8520 2018-06-26 07:28:31 Oh really!Then I suppose those carbon taxes ( remember when they tried to call it a levy) won't be necessary. Since your industry anticipates making profits in Alberta! soon, could it be b/c it will be heavily "subsidized" by rebates payed for by tax on our oil & gas?
8521 2018-06-26 07:28:17 Maria u have a cell phone, TV, car? Do u have anything that is plastic? Plastic comes frm oil. There r over 6000 products made frm oil byproducts. Wind turbines need 80 gallons of oil n grease to operate. Solar panels r made n contain cancer causing man made chemicals.

8810 2018-06-26 06:43:33 Use a sous vide, 61c for an houer and you are golden. You then also avoid the dry chicken you usually get when you pan fry a chicken.

Also you ad no oil or other fat, so its even more healthy.

8815 2018-06-26 06:43:06 Why, it's a lie? Hydrogen requires platinum in the fuel cell as a catalyser. There isn't enough platinum on planet Earth for all the cars the world would want. The car industry has lied about hydrogen as an alternative for decades because they didn't want to change from oil.

8820 2018-06-26 06:41:22 I listened to General Wesley Clark talk. He said, "if the Middle East had no oil, US would treat them like Africa". 

He implied nobody in the US establishment really cares about Africa.

I realized it is stupid for me, an African resident in Africa, to bother about US matters.

8907 2018-06-26 06:24:44 It's like open range for cattle, oil fields, and then factories clustered around cities. The motels are actually pretty expensive because people in the oil industry have to stay at them often, so they can charge quite a bit more... so you need to plan your road trip carefully.
8908 2018-06-26 06:24:28 It's very tasty roasted in the oven with some oil and salt (I also like cayenne because I crave the spices). I hope you like it!
8909 2018-06-26 06:24:21 . @holland_barrett @HionDotCom sounds like overpriced snake oil to me. Got any double blind studies to demonstrate weight loss efficacy?
8910 2018-06-26 06:24:13 You fooled your TRUMPANZEES . 
You sold them a SNAKE OIL CURE ALL, that's only good for Fertilizer....Do they know that Your

Or  You have Furniture made in Bangladesh 
Or that Alot of your Employees in your Hotels are Ilegals.

8912 2018-06-26 06:23:41 I read that white hair is more likely to come when your roots / scalp are not healthy which is why herbal nourishment not chemicals are better. It’s an ancient Indian practice actually and how they used to combat premature greying - you have to massage the oil into your scalp.

9033 2018-06-26 06:02:02 That’s the beauty of people with different skin types I guess lol I could never use oil on my face or I would break out, so I use something like what you posted to take off makeup and then cleanser/toner/serum etc etc for normal skincare
9034 2018-06-26 06:02:00 If you have oil build up in between facial washings, use a medicated pad or blotting paper to remove excess oil. These products have the added benefit of being portable, allowing you to freshen up your face no matter where you are.

9039 2018-06-26 06:01:01 They key to good pizza crust: dough must proof at least 13 hrs: use 3 cups all purpose flour, 1 tbsp semolina, 1 tbsp corn meal. Combine with 1 cup water, 1 tbsp olive oil, 2 drops red wine vinegar (measure w/eye dropper), 1/4 tsp rapid rise yeast. Combine, knead, proof >=13hrs.

Keeping up with regular car servicing and maintenance may seem like a hassle at the time, but chances are it'll save you a lot of money in the long run. Replacing a clogged air filter, worn spark plugs or old engine oil will all help to improve your MPG.

9199 2018-06-26 05:27:47 I’ve heard the argument that they get a lot more miles using the oil for a kayak than burning the same amount in an outboard, but I hear you. And they’re usually protesting oil going to other people. They won’t curtail their own choices. That’s too hard

9249 2018-06-26 05:18:09 1 nation 1 tax is ideal scenario. But our gst is not there yet. Many products are outside the purview of gst such as liquor and petroleum because the states didn't agree.

9317 2018-06-26 05:08:34 Oh it's so good I can't believe you'd not used it for cooking! It's got a higher smoke point than olive oil which makes it good for higher heat cooking. It also becomes liquid when it gets warm so it'll be more liquid in the summer Haha

9326 2018-06-26 05:07:18 #CheapCooking tiny lesson for today: don't try to dry-roast cinnamon powder. It just sticks to the bottom of the pan and burns. Bloom in oil instead. #CheapCooking: me making mistakes so you don't have to.
9327 2018-06-26 05:07:18 tricky because cream usually implies custard whereas creme is whipped oil like cool whip or whoopee pies.  This why I don't trust "boston creme" donuts b/c they wanna charge me like a buck for one but then hope you are suckered into buying the cheap fake stuff

9335 2018-06-26 05:05:30 Also if you eat just straight up cut up garlic cooked with a bit of oil on a pan, it should help with the cold. Also usually my mom would give us this in milk, but tumeric powder in anything from almond/soy milk to even water should help too.

9338 2018-06-26 05:04:41 Since 2014, international oil prices have been at a historic low. Any other government, with the barest of concern for its people, would have passed on the benefit to the public by reducing the prices of petrol and diesel.

9354 2018-06-26 05:00:42 I use coconut oil for everything. Body lotion=coconut oil. I take off my makeup with coconut oil. I tried a zero waste deodorant that gave me a rash and coconut oil got rid of it and acted as a deodorant at the same time. Thank you nature for coconut oil, we don’t deserve it.
9355 2018-06-26 05:00:35 i out coconut oil in my hair once and i feel like my entire being is transformed maybe my indian is just surfacing
9356 2018-06-26 05:00:32 If you reach 10 mil ppl a week, or as you say 1 in 30, your power to sway opinion is huge. More importantly, listeners are by nature political conservatives. Out of 63mil that voted Trump he reached 1 in 6ish as you say. That is packing. I hear Rush maybe 2×a year. Sooo

9422 2018-06-26 04:51:15 The thing is to wear something that critiques the oil spill at an oil spill is appropriate, if so. Oil spills are bad and should be critized. To wear a jacket to say You Dont Care visiting children that are missing their parents is cruel and racist. But probably what hubby wanted

9425 2018-06-26 04:50:41 Micellar water after oil remover on a cotton pad picks up any traces of makeup the oil might have left behind, then I go in with my daily cleanser. That's how I use it.
9426 2018-06-26 04:50:41 It's also wildly impractical. If you're cooking with seasonal ingredients your dishes are going to change. Sometimes things are a bit dry and you need more stock, or butter, or oil on the day etc.

9502 2018-06-26 04:36:03 This isn't necessarily a terrible decision or one that denies the fact there is climate change.    Is the production of oil dramatically contributing to climate change, or is it the combustion of oil? This is complicated.

9585 2018-06-26 04:24:41 haha it makes it worse :( like it’s an easy option but the chemicals aren’t good for your roots at all. use herbal options like coconut oil with lemon juice instead or amla oil! they naturally darken your roots over time and they last longer cos they nourish your scalp
9586 2018-06-26 04:24:34 so what exactly are the benefits behind using coconut oil for hair/skin care? because i’m honestly seeing more negatives than positives nowadays...

9595 2018-06-26 04:23:09 Do you think the advent of electric cars would reduce the fuckery with Iran? EVs means oil is less of an issue?

9624 2018-06-26 04:19:16 Just tried popcorn in a pot (with oil). Apparently the trick is to heat oil with 2-3 kernels, when they pop add the rest  (except take them off the heat for 30 sec). So good

9725 2018-06-26 04:02:07 長野市の人は外へのアピールがほんと下手だよなぁと感じる。内輪でそれなりに集まればそれで十分って感じ。自分たちが頑張ってるってだけのことで満足してる感じ。もったいない。もっともって広くアピールしても評価されるものをたくさん持ってるのに。
9726 2018-06-26 04:02:01 Dekat bilik minyak. Oil dgn sludge.

9735 2018-06-26 04:01:35 @PenskeMoving So i rented a truck from you in NJ and drove it to Florida. It was the worst timenof my life. The truck AC did not work right at all, It had some type of oil all over the floor, which we spent 2 hours cleaning when it should have already been done. There is more.
9736 2018-06-26 04:01:32 Wuddd u pun buat tajuk oil palm? Lol me toooo
9737 2018-06-26 04:01:31 @dpradhanbjp Happy returns of The Day. Why you pleaded with OPEC countries not bring down the rate to 35 Dollors a barrel? 
I was shocked on the attitude of BJP govt for their anti people stand on crude oil prices
9738 2018-06-26 04:01:29 Changed my oil and added in some magic mystery oil to the crankcase along with some Lucas fuel additive in the gas tank. Hoping it helps.
9739 2018-06-26 04:01:13 Very high key, I wish I was one of those slim thick bald headed clean skin artsy girls. But I’m fat, and my head shape too weirdntobe bald and coconut oil make my skin break out. I’m still artsy tho. Barely.
9740 2018-06-26 04:00:51 The hot oil burned as a dog groomer.
9741 2018-06-26 04:00:28 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor. Snake oil sellers don't last, but we've got lots. Nepal needs #education to rid of this pests & #soonWewill together
9742 2018-06-26 04:00:19 CB: Kids still doing that stupid tidepod challenge?

[shoves giant spoonful of coconut oil in his mouth and swishes it around for twenty minutes]

[drinks a liter of salt water and is afraid to poop all night]

CB: Kids do dumb things
9743 2018-06-26 04:00:12 Y’all have no idea how soft my skin has gotten since I started using baby oil gel

9745 2018-06-26 03:59:56 @JasonGregor how many guys made it through Week 1?   @Padgham21 and @ctstiles are still alive.  @dvd_oil is donating $50 to Gregor's Grads.  

Clearly different styles here, Keith is the sprinter and waits all day and pounds them all out in a couple hours.  I chip away all day.
9746 2018-06-26 03:59:53 And if the amount is what disturbed the mindless twit, it takes more Ranch for coverage than vinegar and oil.
9747 2018-06-26 03:59:45 No it won’t. Alberta wants that pipeline more than any of us in the US do. Trudeau’s Dad did the same thing. Expelled the US oil companies in favor of PetroCanada. Huge mistake

9750 2018-06-26 03:59:30 You can. I can't take fish oil. Not sure if it's the oil or preservatives. I can take krill oil only regular strength not extra strength. Son can't take vitamin d made from lanolin.

9752 2018-06-26 03:59:22 Tea tree oil
9753 2018-06-26 03:59:15 So the proof is there, but big oil contributed to his last campaign, so he won’t rule against them. Got it.
9754 2018-06-26 03:59:08 A drop of olive oil and lemon juice to an ice cube then running it over your face gives you better results than some most skin care products
9755 2018-06-26 03:59:03 My man was leaking oil coming around 3rd.
9756 2018-06-26 03:58:54 #SeanHannity 

I practiced #civility and they rolled back wildlife protections.
I was civil and they cut taxes for the rich
I was civil and they auctioned off public lands to oil companies.
I was civil and they put babies in cages.

I'm done being civil. #resist
9759 2018-06-26 03:58:17 Again,, you choose to look at that, but actually, Trump is making you poor. Oil prices are skyrocketing because of the decisions made unilaterally in Iran, Rand is weak because of the unnecessary trade wars that he is starting. He hasn't even implemented any changes in healthcare
9760 2018-06-26 03:58:11 Anyway. This hemp body oil tho 
9761 2018-06-26 03:57:57 similar situation with SSRIs. There's a need, people want a quick fix, someone steps in and sells the snake oil

9770 2018-06-26 03:57:04 I don’t think so.  I am dual citizen. Us and Canadian. US has plenty of oil and lumber   Mining as well. They depend on the US for their military.   Trudeau has poked the beast.  They will be sorry
9771 2018-06-26 03:56:56 ถั่วต้ม
9772 2018-06-26 03:56:50 Hope we MX don't go on a trade war with the US for CBD oil.

9785 2018-06-26 03:54:01 Alsup displays lack of imagination about how wonderful the world could have been if oil companies had not forced themselves on us.
9786 2018-06-26 03:53:39 People may think I’m a “crazy christian” for this but I 100% believe in anointing your home with oil. Seriously y’all, it makes a huge difference.

9801 2018-06-26 03:50:53 - Carbon tax it is. But then...
9802 2018-06-26 03:50:45 You know, the guys that found oil in their land? Their oil was at no cost for them too. I guess everyone who invests in oil wanting a gain is buying a Ponzi scheme and just giving their money to oil owners to Ponzi our to new investors right? #thinkpastyourmouth
9803 2018-06-26 03:50:39 I’m sorry. I get @pirates won tonight. I do. And I’m glad.

What I don’t wanna hear is how awesome our prospects did in the minors tonight. Because it means zero. 

I’ve been sold that snake oil before.
9804 2018-06-26 03:50:33 I'd buy that! I miss Urban Decay's early days when they would pick the most gloriously grim names, like Smog, Rust, Oil Slick, Acid Rain, and Asphyxia.

9808 2018-06-26 03:50:02 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
9809 2018-06-26 03:49:52 @mkraju - stop wasting your time trying to demean OUR GREAT PRESIDENT. Save your time cuz it’s not convincing anyone.
9810 2018-06-26 03:49:46 煙草忘れたかと思った(´^ω^｀)
9811 2018-06-26 03:49:45 “Change the oil in yo car don’t try to change me”
9812 2018-06-26 03:49:43 . . . and who in your group will be scouting out their oil reserves?  Let's be real with each other about the president's interests, okay?

9814 2018-06-26 03:49:21 I have to oil my scalp everyday
9815 2018-06-26 03:49:20 Thats kinda my point. Im done being civil. Being civil got tax breaks for the rich. Being civil got public land for oil companies. Being civil got babies jailed. Being civil will lead to rigged elections that were supposed to be free and fair to help our country self correct.

9817 2018-06-26 03:48:58 Well whitey thinks its a good thing, after all ghadafi gave a home and $50,000 to every citizen who got married and free education and medical and electricity and ultra cheap oil and hundreds of billions to develop water resources, all of which should have been plundered.

9840 2018-06-26 03:44:53 Tea tree oil is a blessing
9841 2018-06-26 03:44:52 The federal government owns around 640 million acres of land (about 28%) of the 2.27 billion acres of land in the US. Around 92% of federally owned acres are in 12 Western states. They have land they can spare to get us off of OPEC oil....or don't you want to stop wars over oil
9842 2018-06-26 03:44:51 No, that’s like a local page. But this page has a rule about no coconut oil. These girls are legit. A lot of estheticians on it. Everything I know about skincare, i learned from them
9843 2018-06-26 03:44:32 A friend of mine saw Paul Ryan in the EAU a couple of months ago. I think he must be involved in the oil deal (maybe other deals also) Jared has going on over there.
9844 2018-06-26 03:44:20 Stephen Colbert-But while they're (23andMe) at it, can they test Trump's DNA too because I want to find out what species can survive that long without a heart. What is he pumping through his body? I think it's fry oil. #LSSC

9847 2018-06-26 03:43:36 Bullshit. Voter suppression is alive & well in GOP states where gerrymandering and ID laws prevail.  Asking someone who will sit in the WH for tax returns doesn’t suppress anything.  If you wanna be president, you should be an open book. There’s a reason trump won’t show us his.
9848 2018-06-26 03:43:35 Part of my job. Oil refining.

9852 2018-06-26 03:42:30 Haha I’ll think about it! Is this the page you found the coconut oil girl you talk about sometimes on here?? 
9853 2018-06-26 03:42:24 Well, I don't want American citizens being sent to their deaths thousands of miles away in the name of oil profits and corporate greed. I don't want the government forcing dangerous vaccinations on me. I don't want chemicals placed in my food. We don't always get what we want.
9854 2018-06-26 03:42:03 Base ingredients are potatoes (peeled or unpeeled), salt and fat (olive oil, butter, bacon fat, whatever). Cheese, garlic, sour cream, bacon, chives & bread crumb crust are popular optional extras.
9855 2018-06-26 03:41:59 Small areas of capital cities where expats and very rich locals live and lots of oil money
9856 2018-06-26 03:41:58 All of them. Oil, gas, coal and now steel.
9857 2018-06-26 03:41:48 maybe even checks the oil. Now that, twitter, is service, and maybe that's what you want more of. Maybe that's why you expands.
9858 2018-06-26 03:41:46 National Health Committee of China has released 27 National standards on food safety about vegetable oil, soy sauce, mineral water and etc. It is noteworthy that the limit value of cadmium in cereal-assisted infant foods is first clearly defined as 0.06mg/kg.

P.S: Sleeping with mascara on can  destroyed your eyelashes take it off before going to bed.
9861 2018-06-26 03:41:16 One should care how much cobalt is used, although the mining situation is probably still better with cobalt than with oil...

Freezer: What are you thinking about? 
Me: Bananas!

9874 2018-06-26 03:40:11 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.

9877 2018-06-26 03:39:56 Should I not eat today?  Nuts, olive oil, head cold, eels, drinking, and raw apples make a man hoarse.
9878 2018-06-26 03:39:53 Federal District Court Judge Bill Alsup has granted @Chevron and the oil companies’ motion to dismiss in the San Francisco/Oakland public nuisance #climatecase. @KQEDscience @KQEDnews
9879 2018-06-26 03:39:52 Shit I was wondering where all my olive oil went
9880 2018-06-26 03:39:50 Maybe someday, I’m still working on my oil blends and now obsessed with making floral syrups 
9881 2018-06-26 03:39:48 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
9882 2018-06-26 03:39:48 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
9883 2018-06-26 03:39:29 Guh this can be ALOT of things on these guys, I think normalcy it ends up being the big O ring in the rear axle, Other spots can be the breather if it had too much oil put in or a missing or dead gasket where the oiler meets the carb box! Those auto oilers can be a pain at times!

9891 2018-06-26 03:38:55 I have family from Kentucky, hearing them say "time" or "oil" is always entertaining.
9892 2018-06-26 03:38:53 Renewable energy doesn't create jobs? I don't think oil and gas industry is hurting for jobs?? Colorado has arguably the best economy and lowest unemployment rate around???
9893 2018-06-26 03:38:53 You don't paint a pretty picture.

9899 2018-06-26 03:37:59 Why? If a person is not religious but lives their life on a set of ideological dogmas then why is that not equal to a religious person who lives their life on a set of religious ideological dogmas. For many politics is their foundational belief system.

9901 2018-06-26 03:37:57 I feel like I've just unlocked a secret to the universe!
Cooking bacon with coconut oil is super tasty, plus it doesn't cause cancer causing free radicals to form like when cooking with olive or vegetable oils.

9902 2018-06-26 03:37:57 Nightmare moment:

Record-low taxes
Record-high market returns 
Record-high national optimism 

Gawd, what a horrible time to be alive.
9903 2018-06-26 03:37:50 I remember growing up gay and being worried about my religious Conservative family shunning me and they ended up being really supportive.  Now Lefties are actually shunning me.  What a twist!
9904 2018-06-26 03:37:46 We quit buying olive oil because the last time I was cooking I was looking for it and I said "I know there's some damn oil in here somewhere" and then the US Army showed up and liberated my kitchen

9908 2018-06-26 03:36:57 What’s your favorite face oil/cream? @JoeyKing
9909 2018-06-26 03:36:48 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
9910 2018-06-26 03:36:45 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
9911 2018-06-26 03:36:25 nasi, kimchi, sesame oil, garlic, garem, telur ?
9912 2018-06-26 03:36:20 The guy in the Harley Tee doesn't look happy. Wonder why? In fact, the guy in the Trump gear doesn't look very happy either. Snake oil not working?
9913 2018-06-26 03:36:17 Yeah, wearing them is a two-day commitment. I use jojoba and coconut oil as my regular makeup remover though and it does do the trick, just takes a minute.
9914 2018-06-26 03:36:07 I love eating pasta after skincare bc I have no clue if I have tea tree oil or butter on my face 
9915 2018-06-26 03:35:22 Venezuela, which sits atop the world's largest oil reserves, was once one of Latin America's wealthiest countries. But mismanagement & a drop in global oil prices have resulted in a deepening economic & political crisis & is experiencing critical shortages of food & medicine.
9916 2018-06-26 03:35:08 In most Middle Class Kitchen, salt/oil will always be there (bough in bulk quantities months ago). When People go for (Vegetable) Shopping in local Market, you don't really think of salt or oil. Or about what cooking utensils available or not. So, it is understandable they forgot
9917 2018-06-26 03:35:01 @T2000000000 how much fish oil should i be taking daily for my fukked up joints and ligaments
9918 2018-06-26 03:34:46 honestly seeing Red Velvet perform Bad Boy live was like what I wish taking CBD oil felt like
9919 2018-06-26 03:34:44 Could you give me reasons why the Democrats are just as bad as Republicans? Keep the things I listed in mind (few more: the right embracing Trump and his racism, rolling back regulations on oil drilling, the banking industry, trophy hunting, skyrocketing civilian death overseas)
9920 2018-06-26 03:34:32 I think I need to put essence oil on a cloth or something before I hoover these space bags down, the pajama pants sort of smell like plastic pool toy straight out of the package on day one of swimming day. This is gross.
9921 2018-06-26 03:34:30 Getting my oil changed at 1130 pm nbd
9922 2018-06-26 03:34:26 I got the vitamin E oil at wholefoods and vitamin C I got it online but it was expensive
9923 2018-06-26 03:34:23 Bumble & bumble. It's expensive but I just use the tiniest amount that I possibly can for each wash. Invisible oil shampoo & conditioner. & the Don't Blow It is WONDERFUL
9924 2018-06-26 03:34:07 I feel like oil changes should be free 1st 3 months or 6 months some damn
9925 2018-06-26 03:34:04 This reads like a high schooler wrote it. These entitled brats are incensed that they didn’t get what they wanted
9926 2018-06-26 03:34:03 Plastic is a Petro-Chemical Product so Oil Co's will be opposed to Paper Bags.

Guide our leaders right, grant them good sense, compassion & the courage to act right.

Please heal Nigeria, Lord
9929 2018-06-26 03:33:33 I just made a fat ass burger. Cooked it in olive oil and butter so it has a nice crispy edge and covered it in sharp cheddar while it was cooking so it has that going for it too lol. #HighShit

9934 2018-06-26 03:32:59 My stomach feels so dry and itchy all of a sudden even tho I put oil on it & I refuse to scratch it cause I don’t want stretch marks 
9935 2018-06-26 03:32:55 "Ma'am nahulog po panyo niyo" 
"ma'am ito po panyo niyo linabhan ko" 

Waw kuya. Nahulog yan sa may waste oil. Sa tingin mo gagamitin ko pa yan ha. Kuya contaminated na yan ihhh.
9936 2018-06-26 03:32:51 Hey Donny boy, time for you to go in and get the oil changed in your hair.  Your father hates you because you're a failure.
9937 2018-06-26 03:32:50 1-Olive oil and Castor oil mixed together,and applied to lashes promotes growth.

2-Petroleum Jelly applied on your eyelashes at night and left overnight, can make them grow faster.Apply 3-4 time a week.
9938 2018-06-26 03:32:49 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.

9944 2018-06-26 03:32:17 Vitamin E Oil and vitamin C serum
9945 2018-06-26 03:32:12 #mmrt 47: Pollo Campero, 3½★. Generous crunch and citrusy seasoning make up for mass-market pre-cooking and lots of oil, at least for the first couple of pieces. Wide array of sides (incl. corn salad, platanos, yuca), good drinks (incl. guava!), slow but friendly full service.
9946 2018-06-26 03:32:12 Lemon Juice 
Squeeze fresh lemon juice and add it to a spray bottle along with a teaspoon of oil to keep your hair from drying out. Do this when you plan on being in the sun alot, like a day at the zoo or while you tan. Without the sun it won't work.
9947 2018-06-26 03:32:10 Sorry! Had to oil up for you!

9951 2018-06-26 03:31:42 You and Plumpie only care about Venezuela because of their oil. If you truly cared for the people of South America, you’d visit the nation’s whose populations are fleeing to escape violence, starvation, kidnapping, & death. If we help remove the problems, Not asylum seekers.
9952 2018-06-26 03:31:31 Both teams having players that have won Euros or WCs helps with that.
9953 2018-06-26 03:31:15 The rising cost of oil. The rising global debt. And the record stagflation that follows, makes the first kick at the first global domino...

9960 2018-06-26 03:30:33 Understandable. 

I don't think many people would find a youkai that secretes oil from his skin to be that pleasing of a thought.
9961 2018-06-26 03:30:18 Same combo skin and matte is a no from me...the only time I’ll do a matte is if my skin is prepped with face oil and a rich cream...but then it’s not matte anymore lol
9962 2018-06-26 03:30:12 Whenever it's time for me to refill petrol in my car, that day oil obviously has to shoot higher... 
9963 2018-06-26 03:30:03 Oil is basically edible, 4 drops is equivalent to 1 gram under tounge, it takes 45 minuits to 2 hrs to kick in. Some take 5 - 7 drops to accomplish needed relief. Bud is instant relief  (obviously) being vape or smoke.
9964 2018-06-26 03:29:45 @seanhannity Dear Mr. Hannity, please hear me. I'm Danny Jordan, 49 yr old artist f/ Texas, sent a $15,000 oil painting to @POTUS LAST SEPTEMBER. It was re-routed and is stranded in Virginia. Democrats are literally holding it hostage and with your help, I can get it delivered.

9966 2018-06-26 03:29:34 Hot oil treatment did my hair justice. My hair so soft and my curls are so nice
9967 2018-06-26 03:29:33 I tried a new pre-poo combo today and I liked the results:

Aussie 3 min conditioner + olive oil, honey, Shea butter, coconut oil and some other combined oils. 

Will definitely try again.

9972 2018-06-26 03:28:42 Is the sauce oil ?

Black bean/chick pea with hemp seeds, dress with lemon and olive oil and other seasoning as desired 

rice with sautéed vegetables, fried egg on top (think Korean bibimbap but no meat)

9986 2018-06-26 03:27:22 Thats really warm out so please stay safe. Also i know that vitamin e oil, coconut oil, and bio oil help fade scars super quick if you mix them (the oils) and massage it in to the scar for 5-15 minutes a day. Ive done it to get rid of scars and stuff from s/h. Shit works well.
