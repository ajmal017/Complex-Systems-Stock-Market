40 2018-11-07 22:05:21 Pensava que só Bolsonaro se sentiria perdido. O Paulo Guedes vive num devaneio esquizofrênico e fala uma barbaridade atrás da outra. Desprezar o Mercosul e BRICS é insanidade. Os EUA são concorrentes na venda de commodities como soja, por exemplo. Alguém avisa a Bolsonaro.
41 2018-11-07 22:03:35 My decision will depend on the range and quality of services the Chinese telco will provide to users. There are already a lot of other Chinese commodities in the marketplace nowadays. We are now living in the age of globalization where competitiveness is essential.
42 2018-11-07 22:00:37 The problem,  I see is the produce and fruits that are grown in and brought in LA Harbor & needed commodities will be used to manipulate the rest of USA. I grow veggie, chicken eggs in rural.  Many don't /can't and that's all our problem, many US crops are not edible products .

46 2018-11-07 21:13:58 The most significant difference between the two is that Pamela is largely taken advantage of and controlled by the men in her life (father and her own rapist) whereas Syrena turns the men in her life into commodities, representing a reversal in the power dynamic.

61 2018-11-07 20:13:10 Even the most overtly political works of art can simultaneously, as commodities, participate in the reproduction of the structural inequities they profess to condemn. The author is a producer.

69 2018-11-07 19:36:32 You know nothing about countries treasury, neither do you know anything about looted funds nor reserves. What matters here is what you and every other common Nigerian know which is the prices of commodities which directly affect the citizens. Pls have sense okay
70 2018-11-07 19:32:36 True in the case of durable goods or commodities.  Producers increase production which then creates a surplus.  Your scenario assumes the economy will respond by increasing production of workers desiring / seeking minimum wage jobs.

74 2018-11-07 19:24:11 @Asad_Umar Country can become self sufficient in pulses beans chickpeas and edible oil seeds crop if policy is encouraging for growers to reduce dependency on imported pulses beans and chickpeas. GoP spent more than Rs.860 Bn last FY on commodities operation yielded nothing
75 2018-11-07 19:19:34 Thanks for share. Curious if you believe any govts close to supportive policies similar to mentioned for food commodities, or private sector must step in as described "replicated... with insurance policies supported by endowment..corporate or government fund.. or insurance back"
76 2018-11-07 19:16:29 @msnbc The first commodities traded in 1600s were slaves by Wall Street Banks & 1% on the South.. Today's events just a reflection of the events from the past. The Republicans still think they own the working class. To further that ideology will cheat in every election.

84 2018-11-07 18:12:31 O/N Wrap:
Global equities receive a boost from the broadly as expected US mid-term results, but #USD punished; commodities steady-ish; Kiwi continued to outperform following employment data yesterday, gaining on everything; #RBNZ in focus today.
85 2018-11-07 18:04:58 Useful for what? The commodities markets have this yet no one places trades in both directions. When do you close the hedge trade? Whatever happens, you’re always stood still and lose every time you close either trade.
86 2018-11-07 18:04:56 This is a quote from Donald Trump 5 days ago: "we reiterate today that the sale of food, medicine, medical devices, and agricultural commodities to Iran has long been, and remains, exempt from the sanctions."
87 2018-11-07 18:02:54 Te agradezco que hayas explicado tu punto de vista con más profundidad. Me gustaría saber + como es en otros países de la región. Entiendo que por ejemplo UY o CL son exportadores de commodities y no tienen las regulaciones que propones. ¿Por que siempre debemos ser distintos?

89 2018-11-07 18:00:53 Most real ballers don't like leeches. You're an object at most. My ex and I dated for love, I was a bartender and he was a financial shark in commodities on Wall Street.

91 2018-11-07 17:58:14 So the Americans in rural areas should quit providing food, oil and gas refinement, and many other commodities made on our farms, ranches and lands?  Hope they don't get hungry.
92 2018-11-07 17:55:51 let us celebrate yesterday's victories & laud all who knocked on doors, wrote postcards, spoke with strangers, who donated time & money to campaigns across the country when time & money are increasingly the rarest of commodities.
93 2018-11-07 17:40:14 Amendment 13 received 69% of the vote and had broad, bipartisan support. AKC should take note and stop opposing just about every effort to stop puppy mills. The American people want dogs protected, not abused and treated like commodities.

98 2018-11-07 17:24:45 I agree - you're looking for scarce commodities early in the draft. and Carp isn't really one. Always a favorite of mine when he's going past pick 100; at this price, not so much (God I rly hope Potts doesn't see this)

102 2018-11-07 17:06:29 So you work for DaVita? Why do you think there should be a 13 BILLION DOLLAR profit margin and an assembly line treatment approach? Medical Care should not be turning people into commodities. USA's For-profit dialysis is the deadliest of the developed world. 1 in 4 die in 1 YR.
103 2018-11-07 16:54:44 We have a glut of commodities and milk. What else can be done?  It’s basic supply and demand. The farm family needs to evolve to survive but no one has any answers to what that looks like.

106 2018-11-07 16:44:31 Zoos are not the correct way to keep wild animals safe, as they steal them from living in their natural environment, exploit them; use them as commodities, and separate families, and sometimes kill them. Sanctuaries is the ethical way to go. We need to give animals. sanctuary.

Caso contrário saberia, por exemplo, que os governos Lula surfaram na onda da desvalorização do dólar, entre 2003 e 2011, o que provocou o aumentou do valor de outras moedas, como o real, o boom das commodities e consequente crescimento econômico.
110 2018-11-07 16:23:15 Very necessary!They govt is quiet about doubling prices of basic commodities so how do they expect those breadwinners to balance things.Something at US$20 is selling for $60 bond,$65 swipe....how and why?

151 2018-11-07 12:55:15 Land pricing is not based on a one or two year dip or spike in commodities. It's more like turning an ocean liner, lots of inertia in the system.  It took until the early 1980s to peak land prices in response to the high grain pricing of the mid 1970s.
152 2018-11-07 12:41:46 Important to focus on key agricultural sub-sectors to channel current investment into areas of potential in provinces with higher unemployment such as Limpopo, KZN & Eastern Cape to grow labour-intensive commodities such as horticulture & sugar cane. #FutureOfWork

156 2018-11-07 12:32:53 Actually that's a rash presumption.
The supporters of abortion treat women, sex and kids as commodities.
Good Christians offer loving care to adopted kids.
157 2018-11-07 12:30:20 Very Serious People are shocked there was commodities market manipulation
158 2018-11-07 12:29:47 Yes, the lower rungs of human species desire social status by sex.
Hence trophy spouses.
Sex and humans become commodities.
Aspire to something more and respect women (and men).
159 2018-11-07 12:24:15 Goes to show that it is very hard to displace the first mover.  We tend to see this in commodities as well.

This last downturn saw a massive flight to quality with people dumping alts in favor of BTC or even fiat.

160 2018-11-07 12:22:46 Commodities is only available in the Ultimate Plan and therefore only visible to Ultimate plan users.
161 2018-11-07 12:05:00 The increase in price of basic commodities is over 100%. That's too how inflation had eaten our economy due to poor economic management. In a capitalist economy like ours govt can regulate price and also control inflation but it's deep not for shallow minded people.

168 2018-11-07 11:29:42 “Government money is similar to primitive forms of money and commodities other than gold, in that it is liable to having its supply increased quickly compared to its stock, leading to a quick loss of salability, destruction of purchasing power, and impoverishment of its holders”
169 2018-11-07 11:28:19 Slavery was only an extension of Empire, as unpalatable as that seems. There should be no distinction between plundering a country's wealth and enslaving its people. Follow the money to see who benefited from the buying and selling of commodities including people for profit.

198 2018-11-07 08:28:35 Which right now isn't very far because we spend thousands on an individual treatment that cripples our finances on minimum wage rather than raise minimum wage to an acceptable amount and pay just a little more for a common health safety net. Lives and health aren't commodities.
199 2018-11-07 08:11:59 Nope. It actually would not. What this elitist scheme will do is drive all but the wealthiest consumers on to cheaper commodities that will further damage their health, inhibit their productivity and drive up health care costs.  All while helping Big Food profits. 
Sad.
200 2018-11-07 07:59:41 Standard of living increases because of increase in price of basic commodities like rice, petrol, etc. 
This was as a result in increase of the dollar to naira due to bad economic policies.

206 2018-11-07 07:43:21 The Govt should auction all the assets of the people caught. These guys are the ones responsible for over pricing of commodities, Hoarding and all sorts of dirty business.and then with all the wrongly earned money, They gamble to satisfy their EGO.
207 2018-11-07 07:42:04 Capatalism without compassion is no better than the cruelest of regimes of the past and present.  We are just commodities. Plus, 1st thought when hearing 1st results - how did he rig it this time? Plus u did shit. You lost a majority in the house?
208 2018-11-07 07:38:46 The 30k new minimum wage is still small but expect Nigerians to applaud the FG for approving it.

The prices of commodities would still increase and the 30k wouldn’t be different from the former minimum wage.
209 2018-11-07 07:35:58 In theory in a ‘trickle down economy’ sure this may work. Currently that’s not how the U.S. operates and the 1% are spending their tax cuts on luxury commodities

220 2018-11-07 06:46:09 As discussed with @kirillklip is our daily meetings on commodities, there were no true surprises in the markets following a highly predictable outcome of midterm elections.

My opinion, focus upon the long game within base and battery metals for therein lay the great opportunity.

225 2018-11-07 06:39:51 People of this country are starving, astronomical high price of essential commodities no job's, people looting banks leaving country at will. Farmers suicide all time high.jokers wasting money on statues and all silly name change game.
226 2018-11-07 06:31:01 The markets are unforgiving, and emotional trading always results in losses.

227 2018-11-07 06:30:25 Owing to the current economic hardships being faced in the country where basic commodities have and are still hiking whilst our salaries still remains unchanged,ZEHPA is concerned with the well-being of its practitioners as a simple basic lifestyle has become unachievable.
228 2018-11-07 06:29:38 Hon. Gladwell Cheruiyot is a Diploma holder in Pharmacy. Her interests rise above the interests of the public. Qualified person responsible for our pharmaceutical commodities must be a degree holder. Who is fooling who?

229 2018-11-07 06:23:51 If he likes let him increase it to 50,000 a month, he will still pack his load and leave aso rock, because this is just a Greek gift, if he wins the election is going to be more hardship by increasing price of fuel and other essential commodities, Nigerians should beware

231 2018-11-07 06:20:21 What's the point? People from JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs either manipulating commodities or laundering illegally. Thieves!!!
232 2018-11-07 06:05:36 The election is over, progs don’t care! The caravaners are throw away commodities; they didn’t show up on the border by 06 November so they’re on their own! Hope they make it back home! 
233 2018-11-07 06:02:56 How has that brought down the skyrocketing  prices of unavailable basic commodities. How is that going to bring us jobs,,,jobs,,  jobs
234 2018-11-07 05:54:34 Because the farmer in Iowa deserves to have the same say as the web developer in Silicon Valley. The Senate provides this equal representation. Urbanites who have never experienced life on a farm, raising the essential commodities for Americans to survive on, cannot relate.
235 2018-11-07 05:42:13 #MarketReview #Commodities Looking at commodities,

237 2018-11-07 05:41:45 How would this be funded? With all of the fiscal issues we have already. Why is Labour so shortsighted, this increase would only increase the cost of living, negating it's effect. Labour should push for reduction in other prices, especially commodities.

239 2018-11-07 05:33:50 Why prices of commodities can't reduce?

243 2018-11-07 05:06:36 Those who took a short position on March Sugar at 13.85 were stopped out at 13.45 and took profit. Stand aside! Cancel replace buying Jan. Soybean Oil at 12.80-replace buying at present price of 13.13 or lower. Use stops. #Agriculture #Commodities #Grains #Beanoil #Sugar
244 2018-11-07 05:05:22 Civilians and lands are not commodities. Politicians doing barter trade with them. 
This can be the turning point to end this practice.
245 2018-11-07 05:00:01 Commodities: Canola +1.69%, Palm Oil +1.28%
246 2018-11-07 04:53:35 Yes, we live in the first world. That doesn't mean over taxing commodities is okay. It sucks that other countries' citizens deal with more basic issues of necessity, but those issues are the responsibilities of their people and gov and do not negate our issues here.
247 2018-11-07 04:52:56 If fiat currencies have to be tied to commodities that previously emerged as currencies in the past, which one would you say is the "actual currency?"
248 2018-11-07 04:50:14 Yo shoutout to sheep for keepin me wrapped in their wool commodities
249 2018-11-07 04:34:05 Invest in guns and commodities... paper dollar is worthless...
250 2018-11-07 04:24:53 Again, money emerges out of barter, that's where gold money came from. People simply start accumulating commodities they know other people want. Central banking is a development of statism, not currency. In fact, it's a degradation of currency, not an improvement.
251 2018-11-07 04:22:40 See you on @YourMoneyAus at 16:15 AEDT today to talk $BHP and commodities.
252 2018-11-07 04:15:42 The ironic part is Beto wanted to provide better agricultural infrastructure and opted to settle the upsetting trade war artificially spoiling the commodities and food market
253 2018-11-07 04:11:11 How could  Pres.Assures the recovering of the country yet companies are closing on daily basis becoz of lack of forex.

254 2018-11-07 04:10:26 The same thing i am looking in media from so many years... When PML going for elaction compaign in 2008 they publish similar thing showing pre 1999 rates of commodities... In 2013 PML again publish the same chart comparing PPP govt vs PML last govt comparison
255 2018-11-07 04:07:58 Everyone needs to look into futures and commodities if they’re trying to make some money when the market opens tomorrow.
256 2018-11-07 04:04:14 Like crop commodities?
257 2018-11-07 03:55:16 Dem Party National—and you—turned them into fundraising commodities for the national party — great 4 raising money from across the US but not necessarily great 4 winning local races

Frastrating when I see more Beto stickers In CA than i see stickers 4 local or State candidates
258 2018-11-07 03:46:04 Democracies are not restored in a single election. It’s a slow, grinding, generational process. Hope & perseverance are the most precious commodities in such a struggle, & they are best replenished by allowing yourself to actually celebrate your wins, not just mourn your losses.
259 2018-11-07 03:40:56 Thank goodness for the few good ones who go above and beyond. We have become commodities, bought & sold...
260 2018-11-07 03:39:50 I wish America would stop shoving new food commodities down our throats & use the resources and money to send it to people & other nations that REALLY need food
261 2018-11-07 03:23:21 Speaking of basic commodities, millions of Kenyans have limited or no access to clean water. In my own village people have to travel for kilometers to get the rare commodity, at atleast 1 bob per litre.

262 2018-11-07 03:22:27 Tracking the commodity markets on #ElectionNight. US Dollar rolling back over to the downside, 24.5 points off low. Will positively affect the physical commodities markets. Gold up 1.7 points.

266 2018-11-07 02:43:54 O problema é que ele usou da máquina, e de uma boa fase econômica com as commodities, para “ajudar” os nordestinos com programas populares. Hoje eles por não serem minimamente instruídos, possuem em seu imaginário que governo bom foi o do Lula.

268 2018-11-07 02:33:41 Egito é irrelevante se comparado a Israel, Egito precisa mais do Brasil do nós deles. Quanto os valores citados de vendas de commodities ao Egito, se pegarmos a proporção em números de habitantes, não tem o que discutir, pirraça de país islâmico.
269 2018-11-07 02:27:18 When using the format: "3 1 6" a google search points to "united states census bureau" statistics books (import, export, commodities, consumption, housing, etc), Cobalt and "Entering the 21st Century: World Development Report 1999/2000. The World Bank 2000"

274 2018-11-07 01:27:48 No fue NK, fué el proceso de megaajuste de Duhalde y Lavagna el que acomodó los números macro. A eso sumale las commodities mas caras de la historia, y así y todo no bajaron la pobreza del 25%.
