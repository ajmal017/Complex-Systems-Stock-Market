1 2018-12-03 23:59:44 The oil revenue that is Scottish origin is accounted for in GERS. We produce 81% of UK oil and 62% of UK gas.

The tax revenue isn't  likely to cover deficit in future so no prospect of an oil fund without very high personal and consumption taxes.

3 2018-12-03 23:59:33 Or you know we could have built energy east and stopped buying all together or at the very least drastically reduce how much we buy. Also we are still buying oil from a country that treats women far worse than Canada does. Point missed again
4 2018-12-03 23:59:23 Just because you substituted Marine Corps propaganda for a college education doesn't mean that I'm going to let you get away with claiming to hate crony capitalism while you support the oil industry's business model. You don't even have a basic grasp of economic theory.

7 2018-12-03 23:58:47 Those number don't work out in the long run.  Oil prices were MUCH higher, prior to turn around season.  80% of the industry isn't impacted by WCS prices, because they upgrade before shipping.  So, who are all catering to?

38 2018-12-03 23:57:54 Similarly, the only notable users of Saudi oil are the two refineries in NL and NB. NL wouldn't enjoy convenient access to Canadian oil and Irving said that it wouldn't feel obliged to refine EE throughput to its planned terminal.

41 2018-12-03 23:57:40 Gold diggers dig, until they find oil
42 2018-12-03 23:57:33 The problem with cold weather is that the skin don’t sweat too much. So people tend to avoid drinking water and taking showers. except for atheletes of course. this will cause a huge fluid deficit everyday. The body will try to compansate by making more oil.

Saudis, UAE, Russia, Israel, US.
Provoking war with Iran to control the glut of oil reserves.
Scuttling alternative energy sources wherever possible.
Keeping us dependent on fossil fuels.
Russia's key export is energy, oil in particular.
61 2018-12-03 23:55:39 This has nothing to do with GM and everything to do with #Peanut's reckless spending. It's just further evidence @realDonaldTrump has driven the country to brink of #Bankruptcy and I won't bet against coal and oil getting the ax before he drives full throttle over the cliff.

67 2018-12-03 23:54:55 How in God’s name did you manage to stay in the baby oil chair. If I sat in that I would immediately break my back being thrown across the floor
68 2018-12-03 23:54:51 @RachelNotley & @JustinTrudeau what are your plans when the Oil Sands dry out and there are 2million workers out of work? Why do you refuse to slowly divest from oil and move to renewables to avoid a future economic and social disaster?
69 2018-12-03 23:54:45 If I don’t get an air fryer for my grab bag gift, I’m definitely gonna but myself one. Thinking about making French fries and using all that oil is already irritating me lol. I hate cooking with a bunch of grease.
70 2018-12-03 23:54:39 Got out of work early so im being an ~adult and getting my oil changed because I am way behind on it
71 2018-12-03 23:53:59 I could also mention that the "babies tossed from incubators" was pure horseshit. Still, up to 160,000 Iraqi lives lost not important as long as we preserved the oil supplies, eh?
72 2018-12-03 23:53:51 The squeaky wheel gets the oil... and that squeaky wheel is trying to sanitize this country as we are well on our way.... generally the left

Snake Oil salesmen a speciality.
76 2018-12-03 23:53:16 Oil it duh
77 2018-12-03 23:53:09 Of course they are. The price of crude oil is lower than it has been for a long time.
78 2018-12-03 23:53:09 He is the POTUS!  hehehe  He shows solid stats.  Snowflakes only know exxagerated, false emotion.  They got nothing else.  Obama is their snake oil salesman on the Titanic.
79 2018-12-03 23:53:09 mmm don’t need oil to take poop out of a hole dummy
80 2018-12-03 23:53:06 mayo is disgusting, you can have things like ranch, blu cheese or oil, so i will respectfully ask you to shut the fuck up
81 2018-12-03 23:53:00 Grill some steak/lamb & eat a salad (like prewashed mesclun mix/baby greens, w/ a healthy dressing - vinegar & coconut oil), steam or roast some veggies & slather them with LOTS of butter & there's always fresh fruit like apples & berries that you can eat out of hand, no prep.
82 2018-12-03 23:52:53 First, that's disgusting. Second, how hard is it to drizzle some olive oil and salt on some cauliflower and stick it in an oven? You don't even need a pan!
83 2018-12-03 23:52:53 Yes and no. Yes that eventually the rising price of oil would force liberal capitalism to develop alternatives. No that state edicts to replace oil with renewables is surely doomed to fail.

86 2018-12-03 23:52:33 That's why the majority of #MedicalCannabis  is in the form of oil and edibles. Though there are a few conditions where smoking it is more beneficial. And even if smoked, it is FAR less harmful than opiates.
87 2018-12-03 23:52:31 supply and demand. There is an airline out west and use the tactics. Except for holidays, it on a Wednesday every week because that's when the oil field workers fly home.
88 2018-12-03 23:52:30 What about for oil companies!
89 2018-12-03 23:52:21 How about instead of asking the wife of a male worker in the oil patch, you actually ask the women workers in the oil patch to see exactly what's going on? I find it staggering that you would actually position the well-being of the workers as an inconvenience to business
90 2018-12-03 23:52:18 Well, hell..... Too soon old, but the last guy who was stupid enough wound up in  an iceberg. Backward. In winter. I'm little but mean. So lucky with the guys around us. Of course, i still beg them to change the oil in my Jeep......

93 2018-12-03 23:52:11 What brand of snake oil is he selling us today? The “reimagining” brand or the “rebuild” brand!? Just curious since it changes so quickly!
94 2018-12-03 23:52:07 Big Oil ain't going away easy. smh
95 2018-12-03 23:52:00 I have a question for friends with gauges: is jojobo oil good or nah?
96 2018-12-03 23:51:55 Not a shock to me all devs are assholes to their customers we need to start treating them like the snake oil salesmen they are instead of celebs
97 2018-12-03 23:51:55 Lies, the only cure is drinking lots of water. Like 2.5-3 litters everyday. It will make the skin and hair more moisturized and stops the excessive oil production that fungi thrive on. These shampoos only kill the fungi alone and make the skin drier. So the cycle continues.

103 2018-12-03 23:51:26 The EU is leading in cutting fossil fuels,oil is on it's way out,like coal.
104 2018-12-03 23:51:24 He’s getting his palms greased by Big Oil. No excuse for this.
105 2018-12-03 23:51:24 This is a centrist mouth-foamer’s description of a “progressive who gets things done”. They just never mention it’s the banks, insurance companies, pharma, big oil and the military industrial complex they’re getting all these things done for.
106 2018-12-03 23:51:22 Also, now they sell it in pouches without the added water/oil.  So we don't have to drain it and it should be cheaper to package and ship...And nobody needs to use the can-opener that they DEFINITELY OWN ALREADY.
107 2018-12-03 23:51:20 Runner car burns 1qt oil every 1000 miles. Adding as needed. Do you change oil:
108 2018-12-03 23:51:15 I worked in a school setting for a bit. 1st question during onboarding was where the cameras covered...only place I would meet one on one with a student, if absolutely necessary.
109 2018-12-03 23:51:14 So glad that i work at a dealership because i got my oil changed and i had them check my car out. My tires were in bad condition and one had screws in it

120 2018-12-03 23:50:07 Right I read about that one, they fund it through selling their oil. So would them recieving the UBI be contingent on them holding down a full time job. Get fired and your UBI funds are cut?

122 2018-12-03 23:49:47 So having a handyman oil the door hinges qualifies as “annointing ”? Well I just blessed my master bathroom toilet.
123 2018-12-03 23:49:47 This is the point. Send Alberta oil out east via pipeline to be refined by Irving for domestic consumption. Stop importing 75000-80000 bbd from Saudi. Ridiculous to have Saudi profit from our consumption when we have 35mm excess inventory all because we can’t get it out east.

127 2018-12-03 23:48:52 The announcement that AB has ordered an 8.7% cut in oil production, combined with the tanker ban, #C69, carbon tax, rejection of Northern Gateway, and regulatory obstacles to Energy East (all federal gov policies) have contributed to the position Alberta finds itself in today.

129 2018-12-03 23:48:43 @Shell hey. Who would I contact if I slipped and fell because of oil/petrol on the forecourt? Mentioned it to the staff but they didn't seem interested.
130 2018-12-03 23:48:41 Sadly not everyone can be appeased. Here, If someone works in the oil industry you'd think you stabbed them in the back if u said anything negative about the business. It's their livelihood. Any advancement towards a "green" future seems like an attack on them personally.
131 2018-12-03 23:48:35 Little extra Olive oil and some lime juice

138 2018-12-03 23:47:58 If you are one of "those" people that tells your dentist/dental hygienist that you don't need fillings bc you're going to fix your cavities with clove oil...play in traffic. Thanks.
139 2018-12-03 23:47:55 eh mana. inba hakaba ya zakayi damu?
140 2018-12-03 23:47:52 Bet big oil will still be getting their subsidies.
141 2018-12-03 23:47:51 I just had the sex and after I tossed the old sheath and put on a new one after applying mineral oil to my sex sword
I will be ready for the next bout in the bedroom posthaste
142 2018-12-03 23:47:50 Oil, Stocks Soar on Peace With the Far East. Wall Street and fatcats can barely contain their glee as the American consumer is about to get stiffed again. Last time oil surged, people could not make house payments, buy food, heat homes while air & water were destroyed. No more!
143 2018-12-03 23:47:46 Here's an agenda item: The AFL-CIO have long been part of the National Enhaced Oil Recovery Initiative and now the Carbon Capture Coalition which seeks to extend the extraction, use, and burning of fossil fuels in energy generation making 100% Renewables impossible. Discuss #45Q

145 2018-12-03 23:47:11 Listening to the Albertan minister talk about how the "Albertan oil industry is not just about the Albertan economy but the entire countries" is such a joke... when those 2 million workers don't have a job because you've dried out the oil sands which economy will that affect?
146 2018-12-03 23:47:08 อหห หล่อออ
147 2018-12-03 23:47:01 @NicolleDWallace People rightly credit G. Bush, Sr., for his service as a Naval Aviator in WWII, but I also think that it took guts for him to head out to West Texas and make his fortune in the oil & gas industry after the war.
148 2018-12-03 23:46:59 And I get it having to dispose of our Trash and Sewage properly and Not Just dumping it in The sea will cost more The Cost of not using oil and gas whether Fracked or Not has a cost and making OUR vehicles clean will cost A lot So do we want to save the planet OR Not?
149 2018-12-03 23:46:58 One ounce of ghee and one ounce coconut oil so good for your brain doesn’t matter the kind of coffee can do it with tea too
150 2018-12-03 23:46:52 I actually got an anti-autism essential oil when I was younger.
151 2018-12-03 23:46:46 I should feel bad for #43 losing #Remembering41 but then I think about all the mothers and fathers who lost their sons and daughters in a Iraq war for oil thanks to George W. Bush
152 2018-12-03 23:46:44 Salt, coca powder & essential oil.
153 2018-12-03 23:46:43 Even the conservatives were calling for this. It’s not a free market when Alberta has to sell its oil for less than the cost to acquire, produce, and transport it .
154 2018-12-03 23:46:41 They give them away free at auto parts stores.  You might need to buy a can of oil.
155 2018-12-03 23:46:37 So apparently I was super drunk at the office party yet I did nothing embarrassing and everyone hit my oil pen then I left and had tacos  success 
156 2018-12-03 23:46:35 Pence doesn't sound so crazy now....
157 2018-12-03 23:46:31 Today was a blessed day I have a homeless man in Findlay 20 dollars went and got my new phone got my oil changed payed for my parents cell phone bill and bought my sister and brother in law supper now I’m broke #sendhelp
158 2018-12-03 23:46:29 So is there any cash in there to help Canadians with re-training, etc who have lost their jobs in the oil patch or at GM?
159 2018-12-03 23:46:26 the progress with the planned country wide oil drilling & fracking in previous pristine natural areas, as well as off the coast lines of every state.
160 2018-12-03 23:46:25 I hope he is doing it for the right reasons... which would be to keep oil prices down (Saudi has the highest reserves in the world). Saudi can afford to keep the price low because they turn a profit no matter what..... Frackers would have to stop because...1/

163 2018-12-03 23:45:50 Waiting for an oil change at Costco (which took AN HOUR). Was about to go up to the desk but saw my old neighbours waiting. Don’t want to speak to them so am just sitting at my table hoping they don’t notice me. #Guelphproblems #Guelphed
164 2018-12-03 23:45:50 if you dont like mayo.. wtf do you put on a sub or sandwich???? dont even say oil
165 2018-12-03 23:45:46 Combine 2 quarts honey with 2 1/2 pints eggs. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Cut with butter. Serve on a bed of pasta
166 2018-12-03 23:45:43 All about the OIL & CASH.
167 2018-12-03 23:45:41 iget to work & somebdy said all dat oil on yo face 
168 2018-12-03 23:45:37 あざーっす常に気を付けですよ～
169 2018-12-03 23:45:31 Until they find oil...then it's fair game for exploitation.
170 2018-12-03 23:45:26 We buy very little Saudi oil. Most comes from Canada or state side
171 2018-12-03 23:45:21 Anyone using CBD oil for a senior Doberman with arthritis and if so which one, shopping for a 12 year old senior foster female. — looking for recommendations
172 2018-12-03 23:45:19 We had spilled cbd oil for the animal...I might have cried over the cost of that a bit.
173 2018-12-03 23:45:14 I hope in the end they will: it’s in the best interests of humanity! People who work for oil companies have families and homes they’ll want to protect from #bushfires, cyclones, #flooding, crop failure and all the other #climatechaos that comes with runaway emissions...
174 2018-12-03 23:45:01 "The Beyonce of Journalism" lmao
175 2018-12-03 23:44:52 Ah yeah. Dealer only good for oil change
176 2018-12-03 23:44:44 Oil Man befriended Mega Water S , how cute!
177 2018-12-03 23:44:44 遅れた！！お誕生日おめでとうございます。うさぎちゃんとの２人暮らしいかがですか？よき一年になること願ってます！！おめでとうー。
178 2018-12-03 23:44:40 didn't realize how extra I was until I fully noticed myself packing facewash and coconut oil to bring to work tonight so that i will look refreshed when I film a video afterwards. great energy
179 2018-12-03 23:44:33 Coconut oil and a baby comb 
180 2018-12-03 23:44:27 have you tried cbd oil? I can say it has helped me without the crazy side effects.
181 2018-12-03 23:44:23 Oil man? Ian Wood ran a service company. Asking him about oil exploration and production is like asking your local carrier about Amazon's financial prospects.
182 2018-12-03 23:44:14 I was there at the dealer for the free oil change so they charge for tire rotation
183 2018-12-03 23:44:11 Good job dealing with that Big Oil propagandist Stewart Muir/Resource Works. Love how he said YOU were putting forward the extreme viewpoint whilst the planet dies. PS Resourceworks are funded by BCBC, Teck and Oil Companies. Usual suspects
184 2018-12-03 23:43:53 No worries once his oil drum arrives in North Korea they will have a military parade to escort it to their missile silos
185 2018-12-03 23:43:37 pro tip: I just shaved with olive oil for the first time and holy shit it made it SO easy like I have no razor bumps and I usually have a lot
186 2018-12-03 23:43:37 @PnPCBC Some very rich oil, gas and railroad businessmen from the USA  have donated to environmental groups like Greenpeace to help kill the competition of Canada's oilfield by killing the pipelines that are vital to get our product to foreign  markets.
187 2018-12-03 23:43:35 Only a fool or somebody with alzheimer's would believe you care about the oil industry. You, Trudeau, and Horgan have achieved your goal to cripple the Alberta oil industry pushing the man made climate doom lie for tax theft. Autocratic traitors imo. SMH. Sheeeesh.
188 2018-12-03 23:43:31 This is the kind of stuff that just makes my blood boil. Gender issues for work crews and their impact on communities but not WORD ONE about buying oil from Venezuela or the Saudis who treat the women if their countries with such positive regard.
189 2018-12-03 23:43:22 Good idea Brett, please increase the oil prices for us so that we can keep living in this boom and bust cycle.

192 2018-12-03 23:43:12 @GasBuddyDan listened to you on @am640oakley   Great insights on our oil prices and the link to petro dollars
193 2018-12-03 23:43:03 Natural gas, coal and oil are examples of what type of fuel? #trivia
194 2018-12-03 23:42:59 That was great!  Glad for the oil mention--Rosneft, etc. rarely mentioned in any coverage, but it seems hugely important to me.  The general public seems to go to sleep when it's brought up.
195 2018-12-03 23:42:55 
بالله عليكم هذا منطق الرجال ؟
196 2018-12-03 23:42:53 @PnPCBC Question Mr. Mar, when you were in Povincial office why didn't your Govt. build 1 or 2 refineries in Alberta so our oil didn't have to be sent outside of the Province, Canada? We wouldn't be in this mess today if your Govt. built them.
197 2018-12-03 23:42:46 @TomVernonGlobal Why are we not investing in refineries?  We hear all about lack of pipelines to get oil to the US for refining, why not refine right here?  Something I feel many would like an answer to!
198 2018-12-03 23:42:45 I'll never forget my first week of my Farm Credit internship, when a farmer, must've been 350lbs. 6'5" tall, walked in and had on nasty overalls with only 1 strap and jeans tucked in his boots. I ran his tax return and he made $16mil on oil royalties that year.
199 2018-12-03 23:42:36 #FinancialAdvisors be vigilant. For every seminar & "sure thing" system pitched 2 U 2 take Ur business to the highest level is nothing but modern #snakeoil advice.

200 2018-12-03 23:42:07 Tetep.. soalnya skincare gue emg masih basic wkwk ditambah sm face oil doang
201 2018-12-03 23:42:01 Please can you give your ‘ blame Trudeau Act’ a break. Just once. Unless he’s responsible for low world prices, AB’s mix of heavy oil and has some magic bullet to get around the constitution. Honestly you are really irritating. Show some intelligence. An actual idea or two?????
202 2018-12-03 23:42:00 Bush & Blair didn't start the war just for their own aims,  but for big oil business aims, and are relying on you to blame the victim refugees to divert attention from their criminal destruction of nations for their profits 
What fools are you?
203 2018-12-03 23:41:53 Yea, he has a hard for Mullahs and who receive oil money from mullahs which includes you! So he has a hard on you too! Be careful mullah apologist NIAC member! 
Mullahs are not always around to pay you curse Trump 
204 2018-12-03 23:41:46 Hopefully pulling oil cars
205 2018-12-03 23:41:38 What pipelines did Harper buy to get oil moving? Trudeau has done more for Alberta than any Liberal leader before him. People forget they extended EI for us and funded training programs.
206 2018-12-03 23:41:32 Nope, probably not, because this question has been around and answered as long as hanukah has been. Literally over a hundred answers, starting with the fact that they found sealed, pure oil at all in the carnage being a miracle too.
207 2018-12-03 23:41:24 Will he do the same for coal and oil industries?
208 2018-12-03 23:41:17 เชี่ยย ถ้าแจกกุนี่งงเลย
209 2018-12-03 23:41:09 I never understood the premise of that question. Since olive oil must be used and not oil that was created through a miracle. (I believe that point is made by the briskers) it’s impossible that all the oil they poured in was used up on the first night. That itself is the miracle.
210 2018-12-03 23:40:51 Oil and was of the whole court was very difficult question.
211 2018-12-03 23:40:48 UN ECOLOGISTA DISCRETO.
George W. Bush fue un "oil man" la mayor parte de su vida, no obstante tiene el merito de haber impulsado leyes de aire limpio que redujeron las emisiones de dióxido de azufre en 67%, ayudando a disminuir la amenaza de lluvia ácida de la década de 1980".
212 2018-12-03 23:40:42 The immediate response was many countries pledging BILLIONS to help combat Global Warming But While America doesn't believe Global Warming Is Happening and Palm oil producers stop producing and our Oil,Gas,Coal and car producers don't stop It's hard to see ANYTHING Changing?
213 2018-12-03 23:40:38 What’s the price cbd oil just helps with relaxation it’s pretty much diet weed lol I eat the gummies to help my body heal
214 2018-12-03 23:40:36 Notley opposed the pipelines without even knowing there was a huge problem with market access & now its in front of her.  She tied herself to Trudeau canoe & signed Leap Manifesto. 
She is a brutal failure along with her anti Oil & Gas caucus.
215 2018-12-03 23:40:36 I never understood the premise of that question. Since olive oil must be used and not oil that was created through a miracle.

217 2018-12-03 23:40:27 So the truth is the only homeland to Jews should be destroyed. If this homeland existed during WW2 millions of Jews would have survived. This tiny non oil state is surrounded by a 100 oil rich nations that should take in the Palestinians.
218 2018-12-03 23:40:27 This is a good idea.  Let's burn up all our oil and coal first, destroying the environment in the meantime, and THEN wonder what to do once it runs out.

220 2018-12-03 23:40:20 On a scale of 1 to bringing your own oil diffuser to your dressing room how extra are you?
221 2018-12-03 23:40:11 I know the leaves very well. They grow in my village.
222 2018-12-03 23:40:11 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
223 2018-12-03 23:40:00 Ya left the local Oil Kings stud off the team too. Politics I’m thinking
224 2018-12-03 23:39:59 Do you have any peppermint oil? If so rub on temples and in center of hand.
225 2018-12-03 23:39:50 What did we do today for my final? Talk about oil diffusers and drink wine.
226 2018-12-03 23:39:48 *good point about the US- they had an interest in Argentina taking the Falklands, mainly due to suspected oil fields
227 2018-12-03 23:39:46 I have family working in the oil patch as well. They lived beyond their means and signed up for mortgages they couldn’t afford while making fun of us back here in Nova Scotia for needing so much government assistance. Once again why should we support Alberta?
228 2018-12-03 23:39:42 i hope thats not motor oil being poured on me
229 2018-12-03 23:39:38 me on dec 17th: hey you murdered all my friends so why didn't you delete anything in my nsfw tag
Prudebot 9000: *spits out motor oil* oh my god was that supposed to be porn
230 2018-12-03 23:39:36 Aha. So you’re not a doctor but a fraudster and a charlatan selling snake oil potions to and profiteering from often desperate & vulnerable sick people. You should be ashamed.
231 2018-12-03 23:39:35 อยากได้เบอร์ 03 ค่าาา
232 2018-12-03 23:39:23 Fossil fuel consumption is not sustainable, and continued investment in the oil industry will remove any incentive to work towards sustainable alternatives. We are calling on our government to move us towards more renewable energy. Feel free to PM us if you'd like to chat more.
233 2018-12-03 23:39:14 No plans to get off oil, but we are making commitments to incorporate clean tech and developing our renewable energy sources.
234 2018-12-03 23:39:13 What evidence is there that ‘standards have improved’? I’m only a newcomer to this debate because I had wrongly assumed that all people claiming to be conservationists were anti palm oil. This is industry self regulation which never works for the benefit of the environment.

236 2018-12-03 23:38:59 I am not surprised that citizens voted no to the Olympics. I think a big reason for this is because of oil prices. I think that Alberta's economy is not doing very well. Many people have lost their jobs because of it. I am not sure that they would be able to afford this as well.
237 2018-12-03 23:38:58 鹿児島の旦那のとこ行くのに新幹線で往復二万五千円くらいかかるんだけど、バスで別府あたりの大衆温泉旅館に母親と一泊するのと値段が変わらないことに気づいた。バイキングも食べられるし行くならコッチだな。
238 2018-12-03 23:38:55 Olive oil this time
239 2018-12-03 23:38:48 I love cooking with coconut oil. A teaspoon in every meal 
240 2018-12-03 23:38:45 Will keep it for the oil companies however.
241 2018-12-03 23:38:43 Actually the US has more control of world oil markets as they are now the largest producer in the world.
242 2018-12-03 23:38:31 Smaller wicks burn less oil
243 2018-12-03 23:38:31 #FillYourStockings #EnchantedByNature my favourite products are the tea tree facial oil and the vitamin E facial toner and moisturiser they helped clear my skin and keep me moisturised and refreshed throughout the day!
244 2018-12-03 23:38:23 That's awesome!
We can all use cheap oil, except of course, the rich liberal elites.
#MAGA
245 2018-12-03 23:38:23 Ford and GM won’t admit they’re behind the power curve with an acquisition such as that. They’re too filled with hubris and oil.
246 2018-12-03 23:38:17 And the hunt for oil in the sea floor of the Atlantic threatens the life of the dolphins/whales of the ocean.
247 2018-12-03 23:38:09 I never understood the premise of that question. Since olive oil must be used and not oil that was created through a miracle. (I believe that point is made by the briskers) it’s impossible that all the oil they poured in was used up on the first night. That itself is the miracle.
248 2018-12-03 23:38:09 I was raised in a town that lived and died on the oil industry! The biggest threat to the safety and well being of women in our town were the rigpigs who would come in to town for their drinking and debauchery @jkenney @JustinTrudeau

252 2018-12-03 23:37:28 How is canola oil demonstrably less healthy than olive oil?
253 2018-12-03 23:37:20 Buy me a gift card to Jiffy Lube for Christmas so I can get my oil changed on time 
254 2018-12-03 23:37:10 Maybe force the eastern provinces to buy Canadian oil and gas instead  of importing one drop. Maybe build a pipeline to the east. Hmm. Oh I forgot no one knows how to get anything done.#cdnpoli #timeforaction
255 2018-12-03 23:37:10 It's actually pretty scary.
256 2018-12-03 23:36:55 But you'll also back whatever Martin Ferguson brings to the table. CO2 storage in the Otway Basin, UCG at Leigh Creek and a revival if the Moomba Carbon Storage Project. Enhanced oil recovery in the Cooper Basin and minimal scrutiny of the Gorgon Gas Project. #cleancoal #auspol
257 2018-12-03 23:36:45 @JustinTrudeau is an international celebrity and King Henry VIII of Canada. He screwed CDN taxpayers, AB oil workers, & GMC auto assemblers but managed to get admiration from his leftist, Hollywood pals who love spending other people's money.
258 2018-12-03 23:36:44 @PnPCBC Let's put a pipeline through Gary Mar's backyard in the National interest. The Lac Megantic explosions were not caused by oil, but by sulphurophane in the oil which came from the Bakkan Oil Fields & was fracked oil. Get it right!
259 2018-12-03 23:36:18 This is criminal and a huge attack on our planet. We are glutted w oil. What a travesty of greed and craven self interest.
260 2018-12-03 23:36:17 new oil... and even more importantly
new oil filter.
do it every 4 months,
  even if the mileage hasn't racked up yet.
just do it.
261 2018-12-03 23:36:17 Yup and add some coconut oil which is great fat for the brain and the best to help you poop
262 2018-12-03 23:36:11 Oil
263 2018-12-03 23:36:11 Big Oil rules and they get subsidies to bootThis rhubarb with Sadi Arabia has revealed that USA leads the world in oil productionSO WHY THE ARCTICSOBs
264 2018-12-03 23:36:03 I’m confused. I thought too much oil was being pumped => big price drop
265 2018-12-03 23:36:03 "It smells like cardamom oil." -Lee
266 2018-12-03 23:35:49 I think OPEC's era is over.  Price-setting can't really work when oil can now come from so many non-OPEC locales.
267 2018-12-03 23:35:48 Huge vats of Castor Oil are needed at the HoC, to ensure a good clear-out.
268 2018-12-03 23:35:45 The pristine wilderness and wildlife are more important to me then the oil. We have enough oil plus we need to look for solutions for alternatives.
269 2018-12-03 23:35:41 @PnPCBC Billions of dollars from very rich people in the USA ,who have railway or oil ties, have gone to Greenpeace and other environmental groups to help kill the Canadian oil industry for their own vested interest.

271 2018-12-03 23:35:30 No, he enlisted after Pearl Harbor, served until 1945, THEN went to Yale. Can't you get anything right? Oh, and he became a millionaire, starting his own oil business, by the age of 40. No daddy money, no deferments, a lifetime of service to his country.
272 2018-12-03 23:35:12 True even though many imperialists supported the liberation of Iraq the intervention cannot be considered an imperial, we didn´t even get the oil
273 2018-12-03 23:35:05 Where is all this new money coming from? Oil revenues? Savings on the cost of refugee immigration? Non-assistance to laid off GM workers? My CPP payment could use a boost.
274 2018-12-03 23:35:01 Making your own with a stick blender is so simple. Use avocado oil for a neutral flavor. Also, Costco has one with avocado oil as the only oil and all good ingredients.
275 2018-12-03 23:34:55 Missed this yesterday. Another example of you presenting misinformation. Certainly foreign tankers come to Vancouver, empty foreign tankers that is since Vancouver does not have a crude oil off-loading facility. Empty foreign tankers don't pose a particular spill risk.
276 2018-12-03 23:34:54 Time to cut ties with the Saudis. It is a sham relationship shrouded in lies. The kingdom is nothing more that a very rich warlord staying in power by buying the support of it's citizens with oil money. When the money runs out...civil war.
277 2018-12-03 23:34:49 i filled my tank, got an oil change, and my paid my bills today. i feel so accomplished.
278 2018-12-03 23:34:29 Really? WTI Crude Oil closed at $53.24. @CNN disinformation!
279 2018-12-03 23:34:17 Just a reminder, the mainstream media HATED @GeorgeHWBush when he was president. 

They slammed him as a heartless racist that started a war over oil. 

Now the media is praising him to highlight his differences with Trump, so they can slam Trump.

280 2018-12-03 23:34:13 You sobs could simply by more Alberta oil but oh no
281 2018-12-03 23:34:13 So you loved bailing out the banks who privitized the profits and socialized their losses? And you think the oil industry which lives off the real property of others to get their product to market is "capitalism?" They'd be nowhere without the government carry water for them.

283 2018-12-03 23:34:09 I have a crazy question, with the Billions these oil companies have made, why is AB and wanting Feds, to pay for Rail Cars???? Whatever happened to NWR, the $9B investment to build it (original $4B to build). They refine only 50,000/day for 3.2 M barrels per day???
284 2018-12-03 23:34:08 Guess what?? I make soap with olive oil. Would you eat soap? Does that mean olive oil isn’t ok to eat? Educate yourself.

293 2018-12-03 23:33:34 I see that the Wood family is one of the five families that have carved up the fishing rights for themselves. With him making a fortune out of oil he must think he's King Neptune himself.
294 2018-12-03 23:33:27 Drown me in olbas oil please
295 2018-12-03 23:33:20 Magdadala akong baby oil kasi ayaw kong magkasakit ang foursome at pbc 
296 2018-12-03 23:33:18 Yes, shit is frequently a response to a big slug of MCT oil.
297 2018-12-03 23:33:10 So you have 92% of all the oil revenue not spending scotland 

How big an oil fund would that give us ? 

Norway at 1 tn
298 2018-12-03 23:33:05 The place I take my car for oil changes knows me so well now lol I drive wayyyyyy too much 
299 2018-12-03 23:33:03 And who should my support be for instead?? I know who keeps my house warm during cold Canadian winters... Especially seeing as my family is employed ( for god knows how long left) in the Alberta oil industry, you damn right SUPPORT FOR ALBERTA...
300 2018-12-03 23:32:54 And Steven, when you get a chance mind hopping out and popping the hood? Maybe check the oil, or the blinker fluid? God knows we have no service records or even service these shit crates... - KB.
301 2018-12-03 23:32:49 Oil industry? #RFID is being used to automatically identify assets out in the field, in lay down yards, on rigs, & wherever there's #oil.
302 2018-12-03 23:32:49 So there are people who are yet to discover Mbaka was actually anointed with condemned engine oil? 
303 2018-12-03 23:32:48 Big oil has played its part in slowing down these amazing technologies
304 2018-12-03 23:32:44 American needs oil more closer to $60 than $50 and below.
305 2018-12-03 23:32:21 if your hair is greasy after a day , it could be the shampoo and conditioner you use. like for me i HAVE to use either pantene shampoo or dandruff shampoo just do my hair isn’t oily . and i use conditioner with tree oil in it OR i use biologe conditioner

307 2018-12-03 23:32:13 You know it is horrible to promote oil production or coal production, don't you?

Then why is Obobo trying to take credit for it?
308 2018-12-03 23:32:11 Oil lamp
309 2018-12-03 23:31:58 If you stop subsidies, STOP ALL OF THEM. This would be clearly an anti environment, pro big oil move.
310 2018-12-03 23:31:52 doing big girl things & getting my first oil change 
311 2018-12-03 23:31:51 Yeah but how many ears do you grow using oil/gas?
312 2018-12-03 23:31:36 คลิปน้องคนนี้ ดูวันนั้น กุยิ้มเป็นบ้าเลย
313 2018-12-03 23:31:23 Yeah cause you built all kinds of pipelines in the decade in power. And JT controls oil prices worldwide.

316 2018-12-03 23:31:13 I finally won 1 of those “tag ur friend for a chance to win” joints on IG and just won 5 grams of oil I’m fuckin HYPE!!!!
317 2018-12-03 23:31:06 I need to understand this... are all the problems with exporting our oil....
To be put on Justin’s shoulders???!
Before him Harper did or did not have the chance to make this right?
 Are we just looking to lay blame vs trying to find a fix?
318 2018-12-03 23:31:04 Dear @cathmckenna. More oil must stay in the ground if we are to achieve even our inadequate GHG reduction goal and if we are to stop killing Creation.
319 2018-12-03 23:30:58 Salt, sugar, vegetable oil, literally thousands more 
320 2018-12-03 23:30:54 Beards beards beards. I even make my husband his own beard oil with lovely almond oil and essential oils. Beards are good.
321 2018-12-03 23:30:49 The oil industry owns Trump and the GOP, no surprise there.
322 2018-12-03 23:30:43 Inventing "news." @cnnbrk 
CNN about the French riots: "Rising fuel prices are largely attributed to a leap in the wholesale price of oil worldwide." 

No, the riots were sparked by a 30-cent gas tax hike imposed to fight climate change.

325 2018-12-03 23:30:23 I’ve never tried those before. Smoked engine oil flavoured, I suppose. On second thoughts, think I’ll give it a miss.
326 2018-12-03 23:30:22 She ran ads that didn’t show her face and featured only white people in my area throughout the campaign. Interesting strategy.
327 2018-12-03 23:30:18 You jerk! Stone began bragging about , flapping his lips in August 2016 about Assange! His ego, like yours, will get him boiled in oil and he’ll take you down faster than a dead tree in California’s Sequoia National Park.
328 2018-12-03 23:30:17 Gone to @Walmart for YEARS to get my oil changed. Literally the only thing I get there anymore because it's affordable and fast. Today I was told 3 cars in front of me, 1 hour wait. Three hours later I finally get my car. Literally twice the wait time FOR THREE CARS. Never again.
329 2018-12-03 23:30:15 We don’t care if you’re a lawyer or Texas oil man
Or some waitress busting ass in some liquor stand 
If you’ve got soul, we hangout with people just like you
330 2018-12-03 23:29:57 Right. Becuz Trump is not part of the Power Elite that Bush was born in2. 
Like Averil Harriman & Harriman Bros. & Zapata Offshore w/Oil Contracts to drill in Kuwait in the 1960s - connections from his Dad & GrandDad Bush & GrandDad George Herbert Walker who he's named after.
331 2018-12-03 23:29:54 Ngga sih. Selama dirimu masih manusia ya wajar kok merawat diri. Toh kalo kita cakep kan yg nonton jg seneng wkwkwk. Btw yg olive oil dan lipbalm nivea aku jg pake dan mantulll
332 2018-12-03 23:29:42 Soon the "CONs" will  have to change their name to The "Canadian Reform Conservative Oil Co.Political Party"   to RONA  AMBROSE
333 2018-12-03 23:29:41 I’ve been sitting at the service station for an hour to only find out my car isn’t due for an oil change...how’s your Monday going?
334 2018-12-03 23:29:40 I would rather watch re-runs of RH of  ANYWHERE while kneeling on broken glass than watch Mike Pence oil his way through remarks about President Bush.
335 2018-12-03 23:29:37 The oil glut most certainly is the fault of the provincial government and the greedy oil companies who knew they were overproducing but greed comes before sense doesn't it. And now you want the feds to bail everyone out? The courts stopped your pipeline, NOT the feds.
336 2018-12-03 23:29:31 The country is big and rich enough for everyone, but Putin did not steal it, the oligarchs sell oil gas is their money. Under capitalism, the subsoil does not belong to the people
337 2018-12-03 23:29:29 Work is just like, fries, put them in the oil, fill containers, fries, more containers, fries for 8 hours, lovelyyy
338 2018-12-03 23:29:18 The market controls oil price. Alberta doesn't have an issue with over-producing, we have an issue with access to the market. #ableg #canpoli #oilcap
339 2018-12-03 23:29:07 So then you'll admit that entire segments of our economy, in fact, some of the hugest segments like the oil patch, are built on crony capitalism. There is no capitalism without the cronies.
340 2018-12-03 23:29:05 What is your policy on palm oil in your products ?
341 2018-12-03 23:28:52 Completely agree that biofuels are a dumb use of palm oil. And that reducing demand for it in foods that aren't healthy by encouraging better diets makes sense too. And that there is huge corruption in Indonesia. But surely there has to be some standard for sourcing better.
342 2018-12-03 23:28:47 Dear @JustinTrudeau More oil must stay in the ground if we are to stop killing Creation.
343 2018-12-03 23:28:47 How about ending it for the oil companies too - #fairtrade
344 2018-12-03 23:28:45 Love it! Now cut off oil to #BritishColumbia #BC
Or u will not get my vote next election.
345 2018-12-03 23:28:38 Ur mcm uses bio oil on his face as moisturiser.
346 2018-12-03 23:28:38 Niggas love asking “CaN yOu CoOk?” Bitch can you Change my oil & tire
347 2018-12-03 23:28:34 5様のer好き
348 2018-12-03 23:28:30 I'm thinking the Paradise fire was the tipping point in California, which generally leads the way, against fossil fuels. "Ethical oil" etc doesn't really matter, and Alberta (and Sask, NL) is on the wrong side of history.
349 2018-12-03 23:28:15 I'm old enough to remember when Russia was the world's biggest oil producer for a few minutes. #SadVlad
350 2018-12-03 23:28:13 Commodities: #Naturalgas -6.81%, #Brent +5.67%
Top commodity losers are Natural gas (-6.81%), Palm Oil (-3.15%) and Cocoa (-2.75%). Gains are led by Brent (5.67%), #CrudeOil (4.91%) and #Steel (4.61%).
351 2018-12-03 23:28:11 That just means people employed in the oil/gas industry and my guess is a lot of people in Texas are employed in that field.  It's not from the companies.  I mean my contribution falls under Education because I work at a University.
352 2018-12-03 23:28:09 For oil marketing companies it's tricky.Remember with fuel having been made vatable,they can now claim input tax which they were unable to do so in the past.
353 2018-12-03 23:28:06 The oil companies won’t want people reduce their reliance on fossil fuels though
354 2018-12-03 23:27:49 yalllll my hair is so frizzy ofc the week of wsc but i don't wanna put olive oil in it bc it'll get rid of my natural waves
355 2018-12-03 23:27:49 No oil fund !
356 2018-12-03 23:27:35 I'll have to admit, she looks good for someone in her 80s. Is there something in the deep fryer oil that helps?
357 2018-12-03 23:27:31 Seriously?  Prices might have gone higher.  They have before  (1973 was the worse), but no deaths.  Money talks.  The Saudis would suffer too for not selling their oil to the U.S.  Saudis are't the only ones selling oil. Ok to sanction Saudis.
358 2018-12-03 23:27:29 yes! particularly oil paint which, of course, is what he worked with primarily
359 2018-12-03 23:27:25 Ideally we need to be moving AWAY from gas and oil for fuel. Tech just needs to become more accessible.
360 2018-12-03 23:26:54 Not at all, Russia's economy is heavily dependant on oil and unlike welfare scabs like Bolivia they aren't shilling for an IPCC handout.
361 2018-12-03 23:26:44 All the good things God created are covered. E.g; Gold, Diamond and even crude oil. You will have to put in extra before you can discover them. You will be addressed the way you're dressed.
362 2018-12-03 23:26:43 I just came for a oil chance stop tryna sell me on all this other shit  the answer is FUCK NOOOOO
363 2018-12-03 23:26:29 NAFTA is still NAFTA, 99% the same. Canadian oil companies and car manufacturing’s in Mexico and Canada win. Trump got played again, just as the experts in the field of international trade said he would. Now he’s caving on China.
The market has lost all it has gained this year
364 2018-12-03 23:26:18 Paraguay near family in argentina, he's guarding the water rights hoping  no one knows they got it. because he know all oil rights are going to be seized by the EO come 1 1 19
365 2018-12-03 23:26:08 oil wos dis
366 2018-12-03 23:26:07 New oil dealsの言うveloceは何処だろう
367 2018-12-03 23:26:07 Politics. Not really.  Has more to do with where oil is pumped and then sent to. U.S. claims they have a surplus also. So drove our prices down. Then B.C is also slowing oil tankers to ship to foreign ports. Meanwhile Eastern Canada relies on foreign oil.
368 2018-12-03 23:26:01 Tea tree oil  smells so good and addresses several skin concerns (in the right dosage of course!!!!!!!!)
369 2018-12-03 23:26:01 Alberta tar sands oil is almost entirely shipped outside Canada. Has very little to do with domestic gasoline prices. Stop with the BS
370 2018-12-03 23:25:58 Aha! Yes, I knew about the miracle of the oil, but didn’t make the connection! Thank you!
371 2018-12-03 23:25:51 Wake the F.. Up Justin, you have huge problems here at home. Selling oil less than cost on the West but the East pays market. Stop with the international brownie points
372 2018-12-03 23:25:47 So, how long until we learn that the “Yellow Vest” oil tax protests in Paris were juiced by Russian Facebook ads?
373 2018-12-03 23:25:38 Oh, hey Andy. Was just home in Italy and learned that palm oil has been banned from food products there. Need to research and confirm though !
374 2018-12-03 23:25:38 More chance of striking oil in your back garden now a days
375 2018-12-03 23:25:11 Not my president & it’s worse than that- @realDonaldTrump does believe in climate change- he lies about it for the oil companies.
376 2018-12-03 23:24:55 Sydney CBD Oil, there's your punchline it's up to you to do the rest
377 2018-12-03 23:24:55 Google Zappata oil
378 2018-12-03 23:24:48 Y’all ever put baby oil on after getting out the shower? All Ima say is SOFT
379 2018-12-03 23:24:22 Stop making baby oil
380 2018-12-03 23:24:18 Reduced capacity and dont forget Saskatchewan is pumping oil also.
381 2018-12-03 23:24:12 Ima need niggas to stop tryna grow their hair out if they’re not gonna put no grease or oil in that mf. 
382 2018-12-03 23:24:12 Same way that dick come in the club is the same way that dick come in at the gas station, and at the oil changing station.
383 2018-12-03 23:24:07 Ivan, you do realize oil and gas companies get more subsidies than farmers? Was than not on Fox?
384 2018-12-03 23:23:46 What an OILY snake oil merchant.  He and his boss crank up effusive compliments that are so much window dressing icing on the cake just for effect and more votes they believe.  It's evil.
385 2018-12-03 23:23:30 Thank you Kate Schwartz and Reenee Cummins, I have taken my first does of CBD oil and I may survive.
386 2018-12-03 23:23:27 Well it doesn't make sense. I guess all the garbage is segregated from the oil.
387 2018-12-03 23:23:19 It’s not skepticism it’s Lying about what Science and Oil Firms have known since the 1970s
388 2018-12-03 23:23:18 He's a threat 2 democracy having laundered $ 4 the Russian mob, his sucking up 2 Vlad, Kim, Duterte; a threat 2 the world going against allies, pulling out of climate control treaty, allowing environment 2b trashed by coal & oil industries, etc.

Push back would b electing Gore
389 2018-12-03 23:23:17 For example, taking a Somali out of his country, where heating is never required and A/C is rare, and plopping him down in frigid Maine, where you need hundreds of gallons of heating oil just for winter months, results in probably a 20x or more increase in carbon emissions
390 2018-12-03 23:23:05 Mr Ian (oil is running out) Wood 2014 and the same SIR Ian Wood 2016, the same Ian Wood who has an interested in Scottish fishing.

Oil and gas billionaire Sir Ian Wood still has a strong foothold in the family’s original fishing business.
391 2018-12-03 23:23:05 Tax on annointing oil. Such good move I guess . The next is to tax th3  church
392 2018-12-03 23:22:49 MY SCRUB AND BODY OIL IS HERE IM SO EXCITED
393 2018-12-03 23:22:49 Shut down Ottawa buying oil from foreign countries and start buying from western Canada! But Canadian !!
394 2018-12-03 23:22:46 How about we end subsidies on oil and gas!
395 2018-12-03 23:22:45 Actually Alberta oil belongs to Alberta. Look up confederation each Province and territory owns its own resources. Trudeau placed many barriers and supported each action to block.
396 2018-12-03 23:22:43 All these tweets are for his base who believe everything he says.
Snake oil salesmen.
Say it often enough u believe yr Alternate self
397 2018-12-03 23:22:38 Sube el gas oil, el transporte se mueve con gas oil
398 2018-12-03 23:22:36 Who’s got some oil she’s abit stiff here 
399 2018-12-03 23:22:34 It’s also because (and this shouldn’t matter but it does) Modrić has a longer history of doing this, they probably felt they owed it to Modrić knowing Mbappe has the world in front of him, and finally, Mbappe plays for PSG a oil fueled killing machine in the respective Ligue 1
400 2018-12-03 23:22:34 お前はセックスのことしか考えられないのか……！！？！？ そうだよ
401 2018-12-03 23:22:23 Those cities cannot be running on oil can they?
402 2018-12-03 23:22:23 Oh no, that's gross. I ordered some tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil online and now I just use a bit of those if I want to smell like anything.
403 2018-12-03 23:22:22 What Sir Ian Wood the oil expert who didn't know about the Clair Ridge...? 
404 2018-12-03 23:22:21 Or we could just nationalise any new oil/gas fields?? And take all the revenue (minus costs) for EVERY barrell!!  Just a thought.

407 2018-12-03 23:21:50 She needs it! Her budget is a total wreck They factored in oil price increases It's a lot worse than you can even imagine
She's so far down this road there in no turning back now 
Buckle up till spring Then we can get to work repairing the damage It's going to be a long road back
408 2018-12-03 23:21:47 Yes. An oil and gas company. They’ll leave Canada shortly too with your taxation and disdain for Canadian oil and gas. Bright side - you can help your Saudi friends by importing more and more of their oil. Always looking out for the Canadian best interests.
409 2018-12-03 23:21:44 I've tried a lot since end of 2015 contacting the media, attorneys, The DEA themselves, moved states, etc. cold turkey opiates took in cancer recurrence. Unfortunately my health's declining. DEA raided our CBD oil stores! After being denied thru hospice, I won't beg-suicide 1st

411 2018-12-03 23:21:30 Pence is the human embodiment of an oil slick--shallow, toxic and hard to remove.
412 2018-12-03 23:21:29 I understand the protest. But explain to me why protesters are demanding removal of the carbon tax? Oil/gas interests are also playing here.
413 2018-12-03 23:21:27 My recollection is that art schools do warn about the heavy metals in oil paint pigments and the risks of turpentine exposure.
414 2018-12-03 23:21:24 YO I put on a roll-on essential oil before I took my lab practical and this kid walks over and goes “wtf it smells like an antivaxxer over here” LMAOOOO I was in tears
415 2018-12-03 23:21:21 But... muh equal pay!

417 2018-12-03 23:21:19 Christine - just be honest. The Ontario Gov't has very little control over the price of gas. The Saudis have more say in the matter! Right now the world price on oil is very volatile. It's dropped massively recently.
418 2018-12-03 23:21:19 And no i did not work for oil. But actually the trickle down effect has impacted all of Alberta. Which if you were an Albertan you would be aware of.
419 2018-12-03 23:20:43 I like to boil puppies in hot oil and imma gonna do it.
420 2018-12-03 23:20:40 I love oil paint but I don’t love how my eyes feel after I’ve been using it for 5 hours
421 2018-12-03 23:20:29 So it’s oil in his hair, is that it?
422 2018-12-03 23:20:27 This is a total cluster. Western Canada deserves the SAME consideration as the rest of the Country. While a GM plant closing is important, so is the oil and gas industry in Alberta.
423 2018-12-03 23:20:21 Actually if you review the stats. Alberta oil is sold to one buyer the U.S.  Now if she stood for the pipelines instead of hiding as each one was knocked down. Then Alberta and Saskatchewan oil would actually be selling above what the U.S buys it for
424 2018-12-03 23:20:09 “Okay so just put the olive oil all over the potato and then stick it in the oven” “so what, like lube it up?” “Yeah pretty much.”
425 2018-12-03 23:20:09 what's the longest you've gone without an oil change? 

asking for a friend...

428 2018-12-03 23:19:29 Were slowing down oil production by 325000 barrels a day starting December 31st loosing 81 million dollers a day and you pledge 50 mil to impress a tv personality you are single handedly running this country into the ground
429 2018-12-03 23:19:28 An article was published about "stopping the pipeline" and alberta is super oil based and that's causing lots of people to boycott
430 2018-12-03 23:19:28 Our only interest if we have any sanity left is to stop burning fucking oil, all of it, yesterday. 

We keep burning fossil fuels, we all die.  It is literally that simple.

436 2018-12-03 23:18:40 Not sure what you are referring to, when a stock is hammered down this significantly, it will bounce back with sentiment and higher oil prices.
437 2018-12-03 23:18:38 Got my oil changed today and they saw my power steering fluid and said it was the WORST THEY’VE EVER SEEN. Rip my car 
438 2018-12-03 23:18:38 Some people are mind blowing dude . I guess I better stop painting w/ oil paint bc someone else has done that before 
439 2018-12-03 23:18:34 Goats milk worked when I was younger but not now. I use oilatum plus bath oil, which is preventative, so keeps my skin hydrated better so I suffer a lot less eczema outbreaks.
440 2018-12-03 23:18:28 @GM just got the Tahoe back from @BrynerChevrolet a few days ago after being there 6 times for an oil leak and it’s still leaking oil. The engine never leaked oil until the lifters were replaced and now it won’t stop leaking oil. What are you gonna do to fix this mess?!
441 2018-12-03 23:18:20 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for spirulina, and put some moon dust essential oil in my diffuser.
442 2018-12-03 23:18:11 @waitrose essential straight cut frying chips. Why #PalmOil , what’s wrong with vegetable oil? #shouldofchecked before I bought.
443 2018-12-03 23:18:10 Right. So using the past as an indicator of the future when current and future conditions are different than the past means it must be a theory. However, like with all debates moat people can't fully understand how can you argue on the side of the big oil/Trump/the Chinese etc?
444 2018-12-03 23:17:58 @theturner Hey Chris! I'm a reporter with Star Metro Edmonton. Wondering if you'd be available for an interview for a story about Alberta's oil differential and how we got here? 587-596-4493.
445 2018-12-03 23:17:57 I didn't see it, but I can believe it. I had family members who "worked for the govt." The US used to placate a lot of client states. Then they realized they could make more money if they nationalized their oil & cut out the American & European middlemen.
446 2018-12-03 23:17:47 My girlfriend is being attacked by some teenage girls on Facebook because she said some shitty artist dude should stop posting topless photos and focus on his art. Hmmm getting attacked for having an opinion? Who would have that! They're calling her some pretty heinous shit.

451 2018-12-03 23:17:27 Oil up today. It won't last.

454 2018-12-03 23:17:02 Oh dear, hate to break it to you. The Scandinavian countries are capitalist economic systems with heavy welfare states largely due to oil taxes, large vat taxes.
455 2018-12-03 23:17:00 that box be slippery, like tryna walk on oil
456 2018-12-03 23:16:53 taste it and add more pepper. drain pasta and mix it with the sauce. Oh! Also throw on the breadcrumbs you've made by chopping up stale crusty bread and glowing oil on before you chuck them in the oven for fifteen minutes..

459 2018-12-03 23:16:38 Dear diary today I got an oil change ...that’s all
460 2018-12-03 23:16:36 I bought the oil at grass roots it rolls on which I think would be convenient in this case
461 2018-12-03 23:16:31 The same guy that told Scotland our oil was running out in indy’14, jog on pal , no ones listening to you anymore
462 2018-12-03 23:16:30 I feel like equality and freedom is just a flawed system, we shouldn't be giving pedophiles and the like the same rights as a functioning member of society, likewise we shouldn't be allowing "Christian" snake oil salesmen to make unironic homophobic remarks
463 2018-12-03 23:16:27 "Invasion"?
I think Iraq was an invasion by the UK & US ruling class to protect their oil profits
Those billionaires are very content that you attack their victims rather than hold them to account
464 2018-12-03 23:16:15 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
465 2018-12-03 23:16:14 Haha, why is everyone suddenly so obsessed with Europe's oil suppliers? I have a secret for you, we buy from cheapest sources. 
466 2018-12-03 23:16:03 @VinnieTortorich quick question. When cooking ground beef for tortilla soup or stews, should I discard the beef fat and refill the recipe with olive oil? I know OO is much better but is the beef fat bad enough to just throw away and replace when I want the fat content anyway?

468 2018-12-03 23:15:51 Oh, hello Twitter world...  >:) I am here to PLEDGE my support for the  Canadian Oil and Energy industry... Seeing as @JustinTrudeau doesn't. Thank you for not having enough funding for our vets, but some how having enough  to give @Trevornoah 50 Million.. Traitor.
469 2018-12-03 23:15:46 So would you be cavalier about a statement from the rUK that one of their pre-conditions would be that they keep all the oilfields? I mean, after all, "a big majority of us" don't work on an oil rig, and so why should we care about the oil & gas industry?
470 2018-12-03 23:15:44 Pretty sure my glands aren't normal at this point and might actually secrete olive oil.
471 2018-12-03 23:15:42 RT @Bennett151P: RT @heatherhoweart1: 2 of the paintings off to Chichester for next weeks exhibition including one of lovely West Wittering! #art #oil #coas…
472 2018-12-03 23:15:41 I think aloe & coconut oil cures everything 
473 2018-12-03 23:15:27 apples are why I am not a oil
474 2018-12-03 23:15:22 You mean the neocon Republicans who represent only the interests of their lobbyists hate the guy who didn't take money from pharma, Wall Street, big oil, the military-industrial complex, attorney groups, etc etc etc.

Fixed it for ya.
475 2018-12-03 23:15:18 I try to avoid palm oil.
476 2018-12-03 23:15:09 They do however understand big money from the oil companies
477 2018-12-03 23:15:08 I was on accutane prescribed by my dermatologist. Nothing else would work for me. But I scar really easily so I used vitamin E oil to heal and Vitamin C on the spot directly to brighten :) I have no face makeup on in any of these pictures btw!
478 2018-12-03 23:14:52 It actually is the responsibility of business to address workplace safety and social equity, particularly if that business is as deeply reliant on government support and subsidies as is oil and gas.
479 2018-12-03 23:14:51 It ain't texas...so it ain't oil, it might be something black though...black tar. 

10%...of the supply maybe.

(Ok, let's get real...I took a half a Vicodin once and fell asleep for 6 hours. Drugs are not my thing )
480 2018-12-03 23:14:49 Isn't there some oil that can cure everything too 
481 2018-12-03 23:14:45 See there? Since America’s on the precipice of grasping the economic value of clean energy and effectively doing something about #ClimateChange, dirty oil and #RenewableEnergy!

More people are purchasing #ElectricVehicles and #Hybrids. Powered by Lithium ionor #SolarEnergy!
482 2018-12-03 23:14:42 Imagine having vagina pain so bad that any time something was inserted you needed to smoke CBD, take CBD oil, take turmeric and CBD pills, take an anti depressant, and put ice on just to even skim the surface of dulling down your pain #MyLife

485 2018-12-03 23:14:20 Just passed a mechanic shop with the sign “pumpkin spice oil changes are back” 
486 2018-12-03 23:14:13 あ、でもOILもいいなぁ…

488 2018-12-03 23:13:45 How Did I Forget To Get Some Cooking Oil Yesterday
489 2018-12-03 23:13:41 So need these for my mum. After 63yrs she is now allergic to palm oil...it may be healthier and cheaper to use but some bodies cannot tolerate it
490 2018-12-03 23:13:40 #LiberalTears represents the bizarre phenomenon of conservatives relishing in things that piss liberals off. A common meme is “I oil my gun with liberal tears” or “liberal tears are like morning coffee”. So I’m suggesting that Trump is being given free reign because #LiberalTears
491 2018-12-03 23:13:38 Remember he is the one who groped a reporter, not the guys working in the oil and gas industry...
492 2018-12-03 23:13:29 I ate a full 1ml syringe of RSO oil and that was an out of body experience  to put it mildly!
493 2018-12-03 23:13:02 LOL! That is pathetic. You are claiming I am a troll for simply giving my opinion and standing up against tar sands oil and calling out Alberta for their spoiled crybaby tantrums all because they are getting what they want? #waek. #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #ProtectTheInlet

498 2018-12-03 23:12:13 Climate change is only important if it doesn't cost us oil revenues, right @JustinTrudeau? #bcpoli #cdnpoli
499 2018-12-03 23:12:10 えへへ〜！
500 2018-12-03 23:12:08 Ask for 10% final offer!!  Maybe theres oil on your land?

502 2018-12-03 23:11:54 Who knew a eco friendly brand would be against a oil pipeline   how horrible of them thinking about the environment
503 2018-12-03 23:11:53 And all the adventures you can have that you wouldn't have done when you go to see them (as well as having to take custard creams, olbas oil, birds custard and pg tips)

506 2018-12-03 23:11:43 Trump is all for big oil! I doubt he even understands solar at all. He is only about money and especially money for him! Trump’s a disgrace and will take down the planet not because of not accepting climate change but because he doesn’t care!
507 2018-12-03 23:11:38 COCONUT OIL!!! Great for your hair and skin!

514 2018-12-03 23:11:15 The Victorians wrote recipes like "Add about this much butter or olive oil or lard or whatever you have handy, it'll probably be fine" and they probably had the right idea. Baking's reputation as an exact science isn't unwarranted but it is exaggerated.

516 2018-12-03 23:11:04 Why doesn’t he call for ending oil subsidies.
517 2018-12-03 23:11:00 He seems to be scoffing at the entire oil industry. I can dig it. If he banned the seal hunt, neglected the potential of the inshore fishery and forgot to mention us as a province we'd probably hate him too
518 2018-12-03 23:11:00 #FactOfTheDay: New Mexico is the 3rd largest oil producer in the United States. More oil means less dependence on foreign nations. RETWEET if you support American energy security! 
519 2018-12-03 23:10:59 I do an Aztec clay mask with some activated charcoal and apple cider vinegar and honey once a month and/or “fresh” brand mask of different types as needed. I drink all that lemon water outside. And at night i put rosehip oil sealed with rose water when i remember. Lol
520 2018-12-03 23:10:54 Hahaha.....that's just by the way. Have you been following the tax authorities in Ghana lately? -: Obinim to start paying taxes on the sale of anointing oil and stickers. Haha...
521 2018-12-03 23:10:53 There, one kenotron, throughly cleaned of some 50+ years of oil and water absorption into the cement 

Will I ever be happy with it, or will I just build a brand new one 
522 2018-12-03 23:10:48 what about grilled asparagus w/ garlic, pepper and olive oil? 
523 2018-12-03 23:10:43 I used a natural honey and sugar cooconut oil scrub after i shaved and I have zero razor burn, no razor bumps
524 2018-12-03 23:10:40 Thank you! That is very helpful I happen to have vitamin E oil I’ll try that first!
525 2018-12-03 23:10:32 I would expect people employed by companies in Texas to contribute. Oil is a big employer there just like pharma in NJ. I don't always agree with what my boss would want politically. Do you? Most people don't have that privilege

529 2018-12-03 23:10:13 Why does one person (this wife) think their one relative exemplifies all people?  My dad worked in the oil field.  He's a decent guy.  But he met many men who were not decent at all.  Men need to be called on their shit, not defended by idiots like this woman.

532 2018-12-03 23:09:59 Cool. Then I am sure we have your support for a Nat Turner statue. Send the check.
533 2018-12-03 23:09:58 A couple of months ago I started getting eczema around my eyes and it was SO painful! The things that helped me were vitamin E oil and the Belif moisturizer from Sephora. Thankfully I haven't had any flare ups in a while.
534 2018-12-03 23:09:58 NOT COCONUT OIL!!!!! Not for your face! Specially if you break out super fast after applying simple face lotion.
535 2018-12-03 23:09:55 Got a cold which means I can’t sleep so my mum put a bowl of olbas oil with boiling water in my room and I swear to god I’ve never been able to breathe so well in my life, this shits incredible
536 2018-12-03 23:09:38 The liberal Globalist left reminds me of an oil stain on white carpet. Know matter how many times you shampoo, it resurfaces. Donald Trump is the carpet guy that comes in and cuts the stain out and patches it back together just in time to greet the holiday guests.

538 2018-12-03 23:09:23 yes the oil used to make the jelly donut reminds us of the miracle of hannukah. 
Jelly donuts became the hannukah thing in Israel and have since jumped the pond to the US.
539 2018-12-03 23:09:23 One question Mr Reiner: where is the quid pro quo if there is no Trump Tower Moscow? How about the fact that Trump has pushed for INCREASED exports of US natural gas to Eastern Europe, in direct competition with Russia's state owned oil and gas companies?
540 2018-12-03 23:09:23 You ride a bike idiot or take the big bus either way we need oil for the longforseeable futre

544 2018-12-03 23:08:58 I'm in the oil and gas industry, and I said years ago that the broader public would have to start to feel the pain we were feeling in order to affect any sort of change. It's more than clear that my provincial government and federal government actually hold animus towards us.

550 2018-12-03 23:08:12 Most of my job would be impossible without oil dummy
551 2018-12-03 23:08:06 i need everyone to know i changed the oil in my car yesterday and now i’m a free lance mechanic hmu
552 2018-12-03 23:07:58 So why are you supporting subsidized low cost gasoline? We and France have grown lazy with the miracle of condensed solar power known as oil -- but we've run through millions of years of production in hundreds of years -- why continue to support laziness and subsidized oil?

554 2018-12-03 23:07:53 the military industrial complex and big oil went to the prom with that little fat kid with the bunny
555 2018-12-03 23:07:45 I recall Iraq/Saddam being promised certain oil fields in Kuwait in return for protection during the Iraq Iran war, that was, up until a certain Mr Bush saw an opportunity when the Iraqis went to claim said fields.

564 2018-12-03 23:07:13 Something I learned from a cook at Girl & The Goat: They use rice bran oil to sauté some things instead of olive oil. Less oil taste and higher flash point. I use it a lot now. Lets the taste of the items you’re cooking be prominent instead of oil.
565 2018-12-03 23:07:12 Once I took that Egyptian oil my blood pressure dropped.
566 2018-12-03 23:07:10 at a auto shop for the first time for something other than an oil change and boy o boy I am anxious
567 2018-12-03 23:06:47 Right. Better to spend that money prosecuting endless wars for control of rapidly diminishing crude oil deposits than to put it toward actually solving a very real existential crisis. You do realize there is no Planet B, right, and that your money won’t save you from anything?
568 2018-12-03 23:06:39 Soak in the tub with some eucalyptus oil in the water, omg.
569 2018-12-03 23:06:35 Lol exactly.! She thought she could slick a can of oil.!
570 2018-12-03 23:06:29 You are very welcome @chezlarae . Crush about 30 strands (per serving) with a pinch of sugar; make sure it is almost powder. Add hot water to bloom for about 2-5 minutes. Mix with rice (and berries or cherries) seafood, or chicken. Could also add to tea, coffee, honey, olive oil.
571 2018-12-03 23:06:26 Qatar is more of a gas producer. Their oil production has seen steadily declining. More than this goes to show OPEC is a spent force. The real masters of global energy support was supply is now the US, Russia & KSA
572 2018-12-03 23:06:21 But think of what you’ll save on oil
573 2018-12-03 23:05:45 Out of touch with reality in oil, out of touch with reality in Ag, out of touch with the reality of what her province needs and delusional to think that she doesn’t get the boot next election.
574 2018-12-03 23:05:44 Ahh, but Trudeau whimpered that he “feels” Albertans anxieties.  After they reduced oil production. Unlike the GM plant in Oshawa where he could jump fast enough.   He can’t see past the end if his own nose.

576 2018-12-03 23:05:36 They know they’re despised&fear is their only motivation to f over their country and their children. They’re petty men whose names will be remembered as the weakest of the weak, ready to forsake all to a vulgarian huckster, a failed snake oil salesman. History won’t be kind.
577 2018-12-03 23:05:33 @PnPCBC   I belong to a green energy anti oil spill group who,with other groups, was against Energy East & we all celebrated when it was cancelled. It sure as hell wasnt Trudeau who canceled it despite the imaginings of @rachelcurrin
578 2018-12-03 23:05:31 Hmm @nglkante @paulpogba might have something to say about that  #WorldChampions #BallonDor
579 2018-12-03 23:05:20 I hate having to pay for a oil change 
580 2018-12-03 23:05:20 Since the FIRST press creates “virgin” olive oil, how do they get “extra virgin” olive oil???
581 2018-12-03 23:05:19 Oil sands expansion plans made on basis of reasonable expectation of a rational pipeline approval process.
582 2018-12-03 23:05:14 I worked in a forestry camp and had legitimately scary things happen to me. if you grew up in an oil town (I did) you know there was sketchy as hell stuff happening in oil camps. like come on.
583 2018-12-03 23:05:05 Just ate a cup of instant beefaroni--which is a word that shouldn't exist. Not sure I would be able to distinguish this substance in a blind taste test from a can of used motor oil.
584 2018-12-03 23:05:04 I’m going to use oil to make the apartment into a slip’n’slide. I’ll never walk again. I’ll just slip everywhere!!

586 2018-12-03 23:04:33 Yuh huh, and exactly why was an old old licensed therapeutic massage therapist hanging out at Epstein's house?

Maybe he got is oil changed from someone at Jiffy Lube who happened to be chilling there too.
587 2018-12-03 23:04:31 Dear @JustinTrudeau stop subsidizing the extractive industries - big oil
588 2018-12-03 23:04:23 OPEC depended too much on being able to set production quotas - they're a cartel.

OPEC economies became accustomed to certain market conditions.  All that was needed was to add a little (or a lot) more oil to the market and...

poof.

593 2018-12-03 23:04:01 Official: Monday is pushing the Conservative party day. ie bashing Trudeau.
Can't watch you guys lobby for oil companies. Canadians don't want your pipelines. Stop trying to force them on native land and through Parks and Crown land. And clean up the mess Big oil left #pnpcbc
594 2018-12-03 23:03:59 The guy checking me in at the blood drive just referred to donating as getting your oil changed and I got a real good laugh out of it.
595 2018-12-03 23:03:29 YouTube? Stephen LeDrew? Who's next? Lou Dobbs? Alex Jones?

Stop quoting the tinfoil hat crazies. Develop realistic policies to deal with income inequality and transitioning to a new economy. We need ideas, not snake oil.

602 2018-12-03 23:02:29 I was advised to take a pinch of Turmeric and 1 tsp almond oil in a glass of warm milk for Lubrication of the joints. Honey is OK to sweeten as turmeric is bitter.
603 2018-12-03 23:02:24 Definitely need an oil diffuser for Christmas
604 2018-12-03 23:02:24 Scotland was cheated out of her wealth by Labour and Tory WM governments from the 70s onward #McCrone
Scotland’s oil wealth was squandered on wars, bankers & Trident and massive investment in London with little investment at home or even the north England
605 2018-12-03 23:02:19 The sad truth is that the majority of our emissions are due to the oil sands production, which is pretty much impossible to fix due to our NAFTA oil/gas quota requirements
606 2018-12-03 23:02:07 When trying to be cool blows up in your face. It’s actually a very worthy cause and apparently was already planned and budgeted for, but the delivery is -worthy. And then the timing couldn’t be worse: Oshawa, no $ for vets, AB oil troubles. But hey, only one year to election.
607 2018-12-03 23:02:01 My top recommendation is to find the best way to saute, roast, and/or grill the raw veggies you like with olive oil, salt/pepper, and other spices. My wife and I lean heavily on beans, eggs, and nuts for protein because the fancier meat substitutes while good) can be pricey.
608 2018-12-03 23:01:54 What is best for oil companies and #Alberta is NOT what is best for the rest on #Canada. The @CPC_HQ and UCP's insults of Canadians just proves how bigoted and ignorant they are. The #tarsabnds effect on #GlobalWarming is bigger than you think. #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM
609 2018-12-03 23:01:53 I was like that customer a few years back. I thought workin in a fast food was for people who dropped school and didn't want to really work. Oh, how wrong I was. It must be tiring as hell having to work as fast as you can, people bitching and oil smell stuck to you +
610 2018-12-03 23:01:51 @PnPCBC The debate on the oil industry on your show just shows how out of touch most of your Panel is with the West's needs and the constant backing of the Fed Govt performance on this is #Disgusting The Liberals obviously are in no hurry to get a pipeline built
611 2018-12-03 23:01:44 I think I know
612 2018-12-03 23:01:31 We all should agree energy improves the living standard for all. AB/ CAD innovation in energy is a huge benefit and to repeat AB oil unacceptable is wrong. Pipelines produce wealth that pays for CAD living standards and elevates us globally. This is Canada’s time, let’s prove it.

617 2018-12-03 23:01:04 Dear @JustinTrudeau   Please do everything you can do to stop this impending disaster of climate change. Put money in that instead of unsustainable oil. Support innovation, training, research in green technologies. We depend on your leadership.
618 2018-12-03 23:00:59 I hope someday our History books recognize his greatness. 

The Iranian Hostage Crisis wasn’t his fault, just the long term result of America ousting a Democratically elected government that had Nationalized oil, and installing the Shah’s family, a corrupt monarchy.

633 2018-12-03 23:00:01 Exactly. Her reply was reminiscent of Obama's 'all of the above' energy policy. Translation: we rely on big oil and gas for party donations.
634 2018-12-03 22:59:47 A Dem centrist central ticket is  going backwards. We need a progressive not another go along to get along wall st., big oil,  enablers.

You cant take credit for our increased Oil Production, you've always been against Laying of Pipe...Well except for those times we already know about.
636 2018-12-03 22:59:43 In Baker City, Oregon the lowest prices Maverick are over $3.15 reg gas and $3.33 diesel. One station Sinclair just went up a couple days ago to $3.23 reg gas and $3.40 diesel.
Says a lot about fair pricing with Big Oil.
637 2018-12-03 22:59:31 I also find olives abhorrent but olive oil is stupendous.
638 2018-12-03 22:59:30 Uhu. Three weeks last Tuesday I felt the need to buy cooking oil. It's amazing. Shopping. Isn't it GREAT? 
639 2018-12-03 22:59:30 Then stop building oil pipe lines!
640 2018-12-03 22:59:25 he will never get a piece of the action with US or EU big oil. It ain't exactly Africa. So obvious choice is Russians who will happily pay him a boatload to secure the exploration of those fields. Corruption and Greed.
641 2018-12-03 22:59:25 Did she bring oil for your lamp? 
642 2018-12-03 22:59:16 Anyone else getting sick of all this "extra virgin" targeted advertising on the olive oil bottles?? I mean, I know I'm 25 but I think its fair to be waiting out for that special someone.
643 2018-12-03 22:59:11 I’m waiting for an oil change & just heard someone yell “I want some tacos bitch”  Same, that’s a fucking MOOD
644 2018-12-03 22:59:09 @Justins just tried your product for the first time and it's great. What concerns me is the palm oil. I've read it's a product of deforestation/rainforest. Isn't there a better alternative or am I mistaken on this? This is my last purchase if this information is true.
645 2018-12-03 22:59:08 Also toasting it beforehand in oil really helps with the flavor
646 2018-12-03 22:59:01 By the way my love, regarding anxiety and your migraines: CBD oil is a lifesaver for me for both. Please look into it, especially for tour time. *hugs*

652 2018-12-03 22:58:40 The revolution started in 1965 initially against the exploitation of lands by British and American oil companies which was backed by MI6, FCO and MOD and repression of the people by their colonial agent

671 2018-12-03 22:56:54 Thanks for your insight , hope to see him again with the Oil sometime this season . Keep up the great work .
672 2018-12-03 22:56:46 The oil companies lease the right to extract, process, and sell the stuff. If it were politically desirable just to keep it in the ground until doomsday, that would obviously be possible.
673 2018-12-03 22:56:46 What does this old geezer care about except himself.  At his age he may die soon ( with any luck ) and so he is pandering to the  gas and oil producers and ruining the planet for the rest of us.

684 2018-12-03 22:55:37 Well, the Crown (in right of Alberta, as the legal parlance goes) is capable of controlling it. Since it is the legal owner of the oil, is this especially surprising?
685 2018-12-03 22:55:33 It doesn't. I definitely account for the fact Canada is currently gluttonous for oil. I literally just said that actually. The particular mismanagement of one goverment isn't a counterargument. And the fact it isn't commercially viable (now) doesn't mean investing isn't optimal.
686 2018-12-03 22:55:27 President @realDonaldTrump a temporary deal with Chinese President Xi benefits global stocks and oil jumped 4% to $52.95 a barrel NY  @CMEGroup
687 2018-12-03 22:55:15 What grade did you have ? My dad is using cannabis oil for grade 4 glioblastoma
688 2018-12-03 22:55:11 Yep. Zero mentions anywhere about CIA-front Zapata Oil or Iran-Contra. #WhitewashHistory

691 2018-12-03 22:54:56 Verdade seja dita, a Disney hoje não é muito menor do que era a Standard Oil no começo do século XX. Hoje é inimaginável a Disney comprar a Warner inteira, mas imaginar ela comprando a 21 Century Fox também era inimaginável.

Não duvido que alguém acabe comprando a Netflix...
692 2018-12-03 22:54:52 Ask Baker about the Russian oil and Roseneft.

694 2018-12-03 22:54:40 They check your battery, the fluids, put air in your tires, change your oil and all for a convenient reasonable price
695 2018-12-03 22:54:40 Of course. Putin is all about his oil & gas fields so DJT is just doing as ordered.

What a putz

698 2018-12-03 22:54:00 You need to stop blaming the conservative government they built pipelines get you story correct the @liberal_party is failing the country not just albertans. Oil is 10% of Canada's GDP that a shit ton of money they are throwing away over 80 million daily
699 2018-12-03 22:53:56 What about the fact that Bitumen is toxic and it would be an enviromental disaster is any spilled into the ocean or the Burrad Inlet. Look at that oil leak a couple years ago at the #TransMountain facility in Burnaby, that was an enviromental disaster. #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM
700 2018-12-03 22:53:45 Since you are so smart and moral let me ask you this, if my fellow soldiers bomb your country because you had oil and then proceeded to make some good things, what will you call me???

706 2018-12-03 22:52:56 Years ago the Government ststed they were not in the business of building oil refineries. Now they are buying railway cars.

708 2018-12-03 22:52:53 Right now our President licks the boots of a murdering thug, he says he must to keep oil prices low. Then why gut alternative energy growth and research? 
Perhaps a future Trump Tower in Riyadh. Sort of a sister to Moscow.

711 2018-12-03 22:52:33 You obviously don't understand my tweet. Demand for oil is only increasing and the question is who will supply the unmet demand... it's either Canada or some other country, perhaps saudi arabia with their abysmal human rights standards
712 2018-12-03 22:52:26 Once she had gone he flipped the box open and grabbed a small pouch if white powder, pouring some onto the back of his hand he snorted it quickly before hiding the box again and grabbing some body oil and a couple of bags of crisps. Heading back to the bedroom.

714 2018-12-03 22:52:11 Your simplistic food metaphors gloss over the reliance on foreign Saudi blood oil, Ontario's green energy debacle, the commerically non-viable nature of wind/solar, and hundreds of billions of lost oil sands revenue, not to mention mass unemployment in Alberta.
715 2018-12-03 22:52:10 All of the media really is funded by the corportocracy even if certain media rails against the corporotracy and the corporatocracy  loves OIL(besides Nexus).

719 2018-12-03 22:51:49 Why is oil suddenly being discoverd almost everywhere?
720 2018-12-03 22:51:42 Why do you think putting the millions and millions of years worth of carbon that the Earth has store as coal and oil back up into the atmosphere in a very short time will not do anything?  Are you daft?

I'm oddly enough getting car work done too right now, oil changed and my tires rotated and not only is there nothing within walking distance I didn't bring my sketchbook like a dummy..
724 2018-12-03 22:51:28 Look, Grandpa Oil is a stinker. But "under my blanket" is the pits.
725 2018-12-03 22:51:18 @BrightInsight6 I did military security for oil & natural gas lines as well as protective detail. And have some information you'll love.

728 2018-12-03 22:50:40 You consume them sparingly when you do. You don't become a glutton for ice cream like the Canadian economy has for oil.
729 2018-12-03 22:50:39 I was hoping that they would search for oil off their shores.

731 2018-12-03 22:50:27 Just a thought. I know it's deeply involved and complex.. But Iran is being bullied right now and its not going to help them calm down or refrain from whatever they do that winds the US up. (If it isnt simply an oil thing -ptob is right?) #transparent
732 2018-12-03 22:50:26 Temos que ver como vai ficar o cenário político nos EUA também. Considerando que a Disney tem alguma inimizade com os dois partidos e Trump tem um discurso forte contra a mídia, não duvido que tentem usar o Sherman Act (o que dividiu a Standard Oil) contra a Disney...

737 2018-12-03 22:49:48 That's actually fine. Ice cream and oil aren't part of a healthy diet.

743 2018-12-03 22:49:11 I means Trump will blame something else for rising oil prices, having attempted to say the fall in price was thanks to him.
744 2018-12-03 22:49:05 Qatar announces it is quitting OPEC just weeks before it's Geneva meeting. Qatar has been a member of OPEC since 1961. Does this signal the beginning of the disintegration of OPEC? Or would the organisation rally and hold its ground in a lower longer oil price era?

750 2018-12-03 22:48:52 So just in the last couple of weeks you formed a committee to discuss the crisis happening in Alberta. Wow and with no details just vague talking points why don’t you just admit you and your government want to kill our oil and gas industry
751 2018-12-03 22:48:44 Sock boy hands out 10’s of millions rather than investing in our own country.  Maybe you should focus on building the god dam pipeline Albertans need to get oil to market and bring in the oil royalty dollars that funds billions in programs in Canada.
752 2018-12-03 22:48:39 You're talking daily moves, I'm talking long-term trend. Oil moved way higher today after its biggest monthly fall in a decade.
753 2018-12-03 22:48:37 The kids have more oil in their bones but it's always about who looks better. Mike wins 
754 2018-12-03 22:48:32 hahaha I can accept that ( tho I love it) if we both agree Grandpa oil is a bottom tier bit
755 2018-12-03 22:48:20 This guy's too much. He will hold the native kids for a picture,  then put a pipe with oil next to their water source.
756 2018-12-03 22:48:18 How much money does family of @theresa_may have invested in oil companies? If Funds Management Companies and politics get involved you can see the potential for Conflict Of Interest
757 2018-12-03 22:48:18 Fresh oil change and a full tank of gas living my best life
758 2018-12-03 22:48:15 My tip is to cook yr roast potatoes in oil &not goosefat so everyone can tuck in. And you can cook & freeze them in advance.
759 2018-12-03 22:48:15 I have not seen this estimate of clean up liabilities for the Alberta Oil Sands, do you have any official independent reports you could share?
760 2018-12-03 22:48:14 I agree with a lot of this, but one disagreement: Gasoline is only about 1/3 of global oil demand, and is shrinking as a % of the total. 

Even if you add in motor diesel, trucks/planes/ships/plastics are the main growth sectors. So it's reasonable to focus on the whole lot.

762 2018-12-03 22:47:50 The only viable alternative is nuclear, which greens also hate.

All your green crap will do is ensure the dominance of Saudi blood oil at higher prices in all our vehicles.
763 2018-12-03 22:47:46 Agreed.  They need us on the back heel and unable to respond.  The core objective has been control and management of ME oil along with their own oil production.  The spice must flow.  Control the spice and major routes, control the global economy
764 2018-12-03 22:47:43 Shouldn’t it be the oil companies paying there respects?

766 2018-12-03 22:47:09 When crude oil prices are low -currently- and petrol prices stay high then its pure and simple taxation. Why would that be I wonder ?

770 2018-12-03 22:47:03 Name one oil company who agrees with you.
771 2018-12-03 22:47:01 This isn't Mad Max. The only places where potable water shortages will be a serious problem are places where it's already a problem (e.g., Persian Gulf area, north Africa). You know, places where there are already wars over oil. Not a huge shift.

773 2018-12-03 22:46:50 Me too. I eat them straight out of the can usually. In Portugal we like to put them with olive oil, parsley and garlic.
774 2018-12-03 22:46:33 7000 more oil cars will put even more strain on grain shipments by rail. Lack of pipelines is having a ripple effect across the entire economy
775 2018-12-03 22:46:29 I think she brokered Sheikh Mansour’s purchase of a City so likely she’s well connected with the Middle East. Be nice to get some more dirty oil money in the Premier League.
776 2018-12-03 22:46:27 I've never heard of blepharitis before, so I popped it into Google. Says a common cause is clogged oil glands near the base of the eyelash., but it can be caused by dandruff, infection, allergies, or mites or lice. Oh, and stress, too.

781 2018-12-03 22:46:22 2. in oil wells, which she did, but he never told her that she had to maintain the oil wells and for 20 years. She lost all of her money. It’s like buying a car and thinking that’s all there is to owning a car. No gas, lube/oil change, tune-up, insurance
782 2018-12-03 22:46:14 Basically you support shutting down an entire industry because some oil workers went too far with 3 gals in the 50's. Do you not recognize how absurd this comment is? If the big bad rig-pigs were threatening, maybe a few local boys (like you) should have been with these gals.
783 2018-12-03 22:46:14 @liberal_party Feds already got one pipeline approved and under construction, and working on the other one delayed by the courts. What more do you fricken want them to do? Toss Alberta sludge oil hand over fist bucket by bucket end over end all the way to the coast? #cdnpoli
784 2018-12-03 22:46:09 I need some of that anointing oil!
785 2018-12-03 22:46:07 Coconut oil was made for me I swear
786 2018-12-03 22:46:05 I'm very interested in their focus on "family men" as if a) *all* the men on oil rigs, rural construction sites, etc. have spouses & kids and b) no one in the communities Trudeau expressed concern for has a family
787 2018-12-03 22:46:00 Furthermore this isn't a sustainable investment. The oil industry is a temporary injection into the economy. It can't be relied upon long term. Canada's economy should be focused on preserving natural resources as much as we can and developing a long term green sector.
788 2018-12-03 22:45:57 Rob oil and go under sun
789 2018-12-03 22:45:35 Are you seriously a denier. So, not that you or I are scientists, but on balance those who deny are generally into or funded by big oil etc. and the majority who believe are not evil fucks. So what is the big conspiracy?

801 2018-12-03 22:44:30 Just because the oil industry makes money doesn't make it good for the economy.
The fact that companies require billions in incentives to come and extract oil means the market isn't there for it yet and we should leave it for when oil is worth more to maximize the positive impact

807 2018-12-03 22:44:00 Prices are simply due to increase in global oil price and changes in exchange rate of currency whereas the international prices of petrol had never been lower. So we had this new class of politicians like narendera modi, emmanuel macron who are increasingly taxing the poor ....

813 2018-12-03 22:43:22 The Greens don’t seem to realize the world runs on oil and there is nothing to replace it.  A world without oil means no food in supermarkets, no PDA’s, no warm buildings and a 1000’s other things we take for granted. Massive social unrest with no oil.

817 2018-12-03 22:42:41 4 Democrats, their number 1 policy agenda is climate change. Their biggest enemy/obstacle is fossil fuels.

So for Obama to take credit for the resurgence of the coal & oil industries is absolutely ludicrous.

Obama is stupidly idiotic.
818 2018-12-03 22:42:34 Oil for the Brits, communism for the US, if I get the wiki article. Oil prices were low, and no American companies were interested in going in. Fear of communism was at its height then, rational or not. A catastrophically bad decision we are still hurting from.

823 2018-12-03 22:42:05 If we’re going to constantly cite sex slaves in the Middle East as reasons not to buy Saudi oil, shouldn’t we address the underage prostitution that we know occurs in transient communities in Canada as well?
824 2018-12-03 22:42:05 !!!! Finding an amazing oil painting brush is the hardest thing ever tbh !!!!! But yeaa allot of people end up missing on some important info cuz people for some odd reason like to hold off infos !!!!
825 2018-12-03 22:41:59 I’m pretty sure @SeekingAlpha is owned by an oil company or at the very least gets some serious kickbacks. @Tesla FUD is ridiculous.

827 2018-12-03 22:41:55 @AmberKhan Any suggestions to help heal my intestinal autoimmune disease without drugs?

830 2018-12-03 22:41:32 ABC correction off the highs.   Just need oil to continue the downtrend after this retracement.
831 2018-12-03 22:41:31 One of the execs at the oil company that @thepandaranda is fighting, but sympathetic to the cause. In secret, you conspire with @shelbyisalright to reveal the damning evidence that the company is indeed responsible for the pollution

844 2018-12-03 22:40:22 I don't doubt your claims and I'm sure your company's heart is in the right place but rapeseed oil in any form is not a whole food and something we've only been widely consuming for a few decades
845 2018-12-03 22:40:21 JT was talking about how soft my skin is. Baby, that's some good ol Mario Badescu, Hydroboost, Jojoba oil and lil scrubbies on the face and Korean exfoliating rags on the body with some whipped souffle moisturizer, and baby oil on the body.

853 2018-12-03 22:38:54 BTW @realDonaldTrump you don’t  even know it’s really the Feast of Desication.  Bet I will lose from friends, but fact check it. It’s not about oil it’s about the Israelites taking back fr the Greeks the holy place   Six not eight candles. Nothing to do with oil. Read the book.

863 2018-12-03 22:37:33 Woke up early, did some work for school, changed the oil in my car, burned my hands (bcuz of hot motor oil), and now im about to hit the gym. Pretty productive. Lemme find a way to fuck this up.

872 2018-12-03 22:36:50 Hey Jaselyn! Great question. The oil inside the softgels is the same as the oil in Aurora drops. Each mL of Aurora Drops is equivalent to approximately 3 softgels.
873 2018-12-03 22:36:48 Do you just brush through the oil you put on your hair?
874 2018-12-03 22:36:48 Yah of course they won’t cooperate - but they will both agree that it’s totally unequivocally 100 % the PM’s fault .Im thinking kindergarten kids play nicer than these prarie “Oil Stirs”  
875 2018-12-03 22:36:46 The Maccabees only had enough oil for one day, but miraculously they managed to keep the lamp burning for eight days. This means that they still had a more realistic strategy for oil conservation than the Trump administration. #HappyHanukkah

882 2018-12-03 22:35:57 Are you referring to the oil or the uneducated thrice teen mother? Or the fact that she has a product line, but doesn’t have an occupation? Or the simple fact that glamorizing teen pregnancy is alright?
883 2018-12-03 22:35:55 He is so selfless that he plans the oil surge to happen after he leaves office! That’s a real 4-D chess move!
884 2018-12-03 22:35:53 Yup. Local Spanish or Jamaican restaurants are your best bet and those meals are still super saturated in oil and salt.

900 2018-12-03 22:34:34 Mostly due to the oil used in frying and refrigerated ingredients. Frying doesn’t cook some items good enough and turn them to bad fats.
901 2018-12-03 22:34:31 Hello bobby strake no hard feelings.its all polticians as you know . We all believe giant oil in Alberta. But British Columbians paying way expensive gas prices rest of other provinces. What's your issues (pipeline)
902 2018-12-03 22:34:24 @CTV_PowerPlay I am so tired of the same rhetoric the Liberal govt spouts. about saving the oil field when they vowed to kill it as one of their election promises. I believe they bought the pipeline so they can shut it down. The expansion will never happen
903 2018-12-03 22:34:14 Must say, top notch customer service from #fortunatewanderer  Quick, friendly response to my question.
Swift processing. Within the same day, UPS label created & ready for pickup, Wanderer must have been burning the midnight oil. Satisfied customer, many thanks!  @RyanPaevey
904 2018-12-03 22:34:08 Here's a random persons perspective. AB gov't move to buy rail cars and curtail oil production will bring no benefits. Any potential profit from possibly higher demand for AB oil will b offset by cost of cars. Alberta has long and hard way to recovery ahead 1/2
905 2018-12-03 22:34:05 I thought the Canadian crude index included non bitumen oil as in Hibernia 
I will let you experts tell me what prices to look at but my experience in stock prices in general is they move rapidly even to events that don't kick in for a while

909 2018-12-03 22:33:38 Without doubt. Unfortunately, those we allow to play the game for us, i.e., errand boys and girls for Wall St., Big Oil, Defense contractors, Israel, et al., are mostly incapable, because they are compromised by careerism, of playing the game well.

914 2018-12-03 22:33:09 This weekend, I need to make an oil change a priority, but, I also said this last weekend, and the prior weekend.

*June 2018: Saudis steer OPEC to hike oil output

*Nov. 2018: Saudis considering breaking up OPEC !

947 2018-12-03 22:29:20 After their Steppe acquisition, they are about 25% light oil as all of their SE Saskatchewan production will be oily rich light oil wells with the best egress capacity.   I agree with you, they should do well from here.

954 2018-12-03 22:27:59 Since when does the Izzone shill for oil companies? Looks like even you can’t resist the allure of petrodollars.
955 2018-12-03 22:27:58 My oil is fine. Just didnt wanna leave the car and the dealership. It never broke. Battery got fixed in less than one day from driving from IE, to beverly hills, to carson consistently  aint no secrets just closer options than other shit lmao
956 2018-12-03 22:27:58 Do not be like the 5 foolish virgins who let all oil run out of their lamps. Praise, hearing great preachers, getting that joy in you that no man can take from you. Do that. Only Jesus can bar anyone from heaven, for he is the door (Matt 25:10).
957 2018-12-03 22:27:54 Alright now you’ve really lost credibility if your one of those that think Iraq was about oil
958 2018-12-03 22:27:52 @MartinFayulu what is wrong with that decision?Russia does the same with gas and oil why not us?
959 2018-12-03 22:27:49 Wow. who still thinks that adverts aimed at women should open with a bikini clad beauty pouring euphemistic ‘coconut water’ on her boobs? The men at Palmers Coconut Oil, clearly.
960 2018-12-03 22:27:36 Technically, they can be interchangeable, but if you make them yourself, waffle batter has more oil/fat compared to pancake batter.
961 2018-12-03 22:27:27 100% Tea tree oil and witch hazel on a cotton pad to clean the area and tea tree alone to spot treat
962 2018-12-03 22:27:27 Oil on canvas. Pigs heid airbrushed.
963 2018-12-03 22:27:27 With his big oil, central banksters, and central planners, he did do a great job of killing many innocent woman and children in the name of freedom? I find nothing commendable. Rip
964 2018-12-03 22:27:25 So let’s just destroy the planet because his constituents work in the oil field
965 2018-12-03 22:27:23 ‘Chanu- kah’ literally means ‘They rested on the 25th.’  The only way to find rest is to be like the oil and rise above it all.
966 2018-12-03 22:27:14 I feel like the tree farm probably offsets my carbon footprint from this 69 Ranger rehab. It's home, though. It needs ... more work. I smell flammable from looking under the hood and front end. I could easily get under it and change the oil, though. The Excite. It has a gun rack.
967 2018-12-03 22:27:12 Happy birthday....is what I would say if I didn't blame you for the failure of Mobile on the Go by Pharc's crudité garden salad with oil and vinegar vinaigrette! It's put me in a beer tossin' mood!!
968 2018-12-03 22:27:04 Let me ask my sister for more, but gaskiya ana maki zane as kitso, den frequent oiling like every day fah. Even my self I oil mine every time nayi wanka, after ablution kuma brushing
969 2018-12-03 22:27:01 i went in for an oil change & was told i need two brand new tires & i’m poor #venmome
970 2018-12-03 22:26:59 Obviously there’s a more economically sound and sustainable way to prop up #Canadian #oil prices. #Pipeline
971 2018-12-03 22:26:55 Maybe. I use pure coconut oil. You buy it at any supermarket and it’s not expensive. I bought a decent size pot and have used it on my last 10 tattoos and its still 90% full. The body heat immediately turns it oil like so a little goes very far. It’s brill. Can cook with it too!
972 2018-12-03 22:26:48 Can I pick your brain about your argan oil? I've heard a little about it but I'm not sure if it's a styling thing or a conditioning thing? Hair stuff baffles me.
973 2018-12-03 22:26:41 It wasn’t all that long ago that these people were called “snake oil salesman” for good reason.
974 2018-12-03 22:26:31 Ottawa did not wound Alberta ' thats false reporting causing unrest. Oil is in a glut situation period.
975 2018-12-03 22:26:30 Lol yes o, or the red Abi color 33. At least it'll look like it's mixed hair (synthetic and human). That black one looks as though it's groundnut oil they poured on it 
976 2018-12-03 22:26:27 I thought she ran off oil and screws.
977 2018-12-03 22:26:21 Oil companies love weak-minded yokels who believe this.
978 2018-12-03 22:26:20 I need a tune up oil change and new breaks 
979 2018-12-03 22:26:20 How about throwing $50M at Innu and Inuit education? Sorry they aren't as glamorous at Trevor, but they aren't oil or construction workers so it fits into your narrative quite well.
980 2018-12-03 22:26:15 Make your own healthy mayo. Aka aioli with the lost art of cooking. 

Whisk egg yoke in a bowl while slowly drizzling in olive oil. Congrats you’ve now made mayo.
981 2018-12-03 22:26:13 It’s extremely easy to think that one man has derailed Alberta’s oil economy but truth is if the resource itself should have been managed better and in a coordinated way If so I doubt the oil glut would not exist and WSC woukd at least be trading at a median profit level
982 2018-12-03 22:26:12 and Palm oil is just gross...
983 2018-12-03 22:25:54 Big oil learned a lot from the failings of the manure and hay lobby.
984 2018-12-03 22:25:41 I bet Russia and Saudi Arabia would both benefit economically from war with Iran and the resulting higher oil prices, and Israel would be pretty damned happy as well to have their nemesis taken out of play. Iran better open a Trump Tower soon, or something.

Irving is an east-coast refiner of Saudi blood oil.

Alberta! Alberta! Alberta!
988 2018-12-03 22:25:04 Hey how’s your oil btw since you needed gage to come and check it and how’s your car running since Michael had to go and help you when it broke down? Where was big brother then?
989 2018-12-03 22:24:34 & its drenched in fish oil , im lowkey tight
990 2018-12-03 22:24:27 Hello.Which oil should we be using then?
991 2018-12-03 22:23:59 ..do go away now please Palm Oil gang..think you have made good enough fools of yourselves already...
992 2018-12-03 22:23:57 Biggest recorded earthquake in Alaska was in 1964. You know,before oil was discovered here
993 2018-12-03 22:23:31 so, which problem is the worst?
Alberta oil?
Ontario auto industry?
Maritimes?
First Nations?
Child poverty?
The North?
When do you think we will have done enough in Canada to be able to offer, what amounts to pittance, to help others?
994 2018-12-03 22:23:20 The saem aloe vera. Atau pake grapeseed & rosehip seed oil. Pelembab aku cocok itu sar
995 2018-12-03 22:23:18 What’s the point of scheduling an oil change if they’re not going to start my car until 30 minutes past the appointment and I’m still going to sit here for nearly two hours !!!
996 2018-12-03 22:23:18 Imma go get my oil changed tomorrow 
997 2018-12-03 22:22:51 Try coconut oil. Worked wonders on my tattoos 
998 2018-12-03 22:22:44 Andy, you do know that the problems in oil initially started with the last con govt. don’t you? Educate yourself.
999 2018-12-03 22:22:41 @RachelNotley If you want to get “Ottawa full attention” doing what you’ve been doing obviously hasn’t worked. 
Start by stopping oil East & West Oil.
Stop LNG exports 
Make a statement! Show some leadership & fight back!
You’re empty rhetoric & talk is clearly not working
1000 2018-12-03 22:22:32 Even Lie Mohammed, the father of all liars is not dead yet...
1001 2018-12-03 22:22:26 You can thank the global leaders for the market lowering oil prices
1002 2018-12-03 22:22:13 The #GiletsJaunes movement shows that environmentalism without class justice is sheer hypocrisy. French elites claim to be environmentally conscious& yet they exact fuel taxes from the poor, while doling out subsidies to oil companies& disinvesting from railways in rural France.
1003 2018-12-03 22:22:10 Not for money. Not for oil!
1004 2018-12-03 22:21:53 I’ve been a busy girl today... finished up my essential oil blends for this weeks market . lovely little crystal bobbies & final touches on some necklaces Luna Nova
1005 2018-12-03 22:21:49 Great fit. Snake oil coach for a snake oil school.
1006 2018-12-03 22:21:47 he is literally destroying the entire planets future with his blocking of new/green energy fuck oil and coal!
1007 2018-12-03 22:21:41 cbt oil
1008 2018-12-03 22:21:34 Ptite technique si vs êtes avec une meuf et que vous avez dead les toilettes avec votre caca, 2 petites gouttes de Tea three oil aux endroits stratégiques : la cuvette et le lavabo et hop le tour est joué (fouillez dans sa trousse de toilette ou investissez dans une petite fiole)
1009 2018-12-03 22:21:29 I mean I understand if the oil/has industry took a plunge I’d lose my job but I’d get another bc I have skills in other areas. Sucks that some people can only upload content online to make their living I hope the best for them. And do you use other social media’s as much?
1010 2018-12-03 22:21:28 Add some oil
1011 2018-12-03 22:21:25 How did @SohiAmarjeet b’com an MP, let alone a Cabinet Minister? Listening to him talk to @VassyKapelos on @PnPCBC is mind boggling. Is this Canada’s standard for someone to head the portfolio of Oil and other natural resources? As for the #Atwal scandal, “I don’t know”!
1012 2018-12-03 22:21:23 Received an approval on a Form I-485 Adjustment #immigration case (the final step in the Green Card process) for an Electrical Engineer working in the Oil & Gas Sector in Texas.
1013 2018-12-03 22:21:15 Mmmm.......got Palm oil in as well........
1014 2018-12-03 22:21:14 オリーブ油で毎日を楽しく(*^_^*)
1015 2018-12-03 22:21:08 Ponds? Oil of Ulay?
1016 2018-12-03 22:21:01 I was born and lived in Edmonton till I was 10, I have family that works in the oil industry, and I hear & see the same stuff from them.
I always say it's like a Ford employee saying they know Ford's are the best because they work for Ford. 
Hardly unbiased opinions.
1017 2018-12-03 22:20:49 start tagging all your nudes as "oil on canvas, 1880" to trick the world into thinking a dead white guy committed it into the artistic canon, thus becoming Safe For Work
1018 2018-12-03 22:20:44 How is veg killing and torturing any better
Scraping with sharp instruments,chopping them up,slicing to pieces,boiling in oil,water
1019 2018-12-03 22:20:24 Huh. Interesting. I know that the oil doesn’t contain THC, so I wonder why its use here is so prohitive. It seems to me, that if there’s a valid medicinal application, it should be up to a doctor to decide, not politicians.
1020 2018-12-03 22:20:19 @VaselineBrand hi will you do me and the orangutans a favour n start using sustainable palm oil ???? I don’t want dry skin or lips but I also don’t want orangutans to go extinct ????
1021 2018-12-03 22:19:45 Burning the midnight oil...
1022 2018-12-03 22:19:42 Snake Oil! I get that no alcohol is on the rise but still...
1023 2018-12-03 22:19:31 going to wait the 3+ hours to get a simple oil change) they can’t do anything for me. Oh AND I was still covered by warranty. But that’s not what y’all told me when I bought the car? 
1024 2018-12-03 22:19:28 @simoncoveney Jerusalem is Israel's Capital City since King David (1000 BC) and until the end of time.

Ireland = Learn Jewish & Christian History.  Do NOT be beholden to Arab Oil & Energy.  Use your alcohol-drenched brains.
1025 2018-12-03 22:19:26 In general, I make it a point to not respond to trolls, but no, all of your points are misplaced. Beto ran without a cent from the oil fueled PAC's, only with money from the forgotten men and women, and came closest to winning than any Democrat in decades. No fake news, please.
1026 2018-12-03 22:19:25 Some fresh oil on my Cheyenne
1027 2018-12-03 22:19:25 They loook like oil paintings!!

1029 2018-12-03 22:19:17 Who's Oil  @forevermikayla_
1030 2018-12-03 22:19:12 Dear @cathmckenna We need to spend billions on alternative energy infrastructure, not on pipelines. Create jobs for displaced oil workers in the alternative energy sector.
1031 2018-12-03 22:18:58 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。
1032 2018-12-03 22:18:45 There's nothing wrong with questioning the Canadian oil and gas industry.  Even if she wears synthetic fibres, heats with gas and drives a SUV, she isn't wrong.  Your bar for personal behaviour is unrealistic.
1033 2018-12-03 22:18:42 So how is reducing revenue for @YourAlberta protecting jobs and getting a fair value for our resources? It's harmful for some oil companies like @suncorenergy @ImperialOil that prepared. @OilGasCanada We have to pay more to banks for increased loan amounts. @jkenney @Alberta_UCP
1034 2018-12-03 22:18:35 For now gaskiya ki daina kitso, just oil and brush, it will reduce
1035 2018-12-03 22:18:34 Yoooo so my engine AND transmission went out yesterday right. I bought it used from another dealer so I was told by Kia I didn’t have warranty....go to them today and they’re saying that since I didn’t get my oil changed done there (bc I was told I didn’t have warranty and wasn’t
1036 2018-12-03 22:18:34 You know you are getting old when you ask for an oil change for Christmas...
1037 2018-12-03 22:18:34 What is it about the small children + horse combo that leaves one with absolutely no free time? (I mean, except to start a Very Very Small Holding or an awesome rapeseed oil business!)
1038 2018-12-03 22:18:06 Ugh. Commies.

Do you understand how much tax revenue is generated by the oil sector? And how much disappears into the soul-sucking vortex of public sector appeasement??
1039 2018-12-03 22:18:04 Ngl I lowkey panic when I see people pouring oil into food they expect me to eat so like wish me luck this Hanukkah Season I guess, why cant this holiday be about like, fruit instead of oil,,,,,or chocolate,,,,,,,,,,
1040 2018-12-03 22:17:56 Have to have a smooth surface to put the oil on though
1041 2018-12-03 22:17:55 They mostly import silica sands from Wisconsin because desert sand isn’t fine enough to filter oil through
1042 2018-12-03 22:17:54 Prophetic Sir.....won't b long now...30 years tops if that...signs are all over from Matthew to Revelation... shame on those not looking... will wound up with no oil for their lamps...keep up your posts... great reminders and tribute to GOD...
1043 2018-12-03 22:17:52 Interesting fact. Time will tell with both.

1046 2018-12-03 22:17:41 Gift idea: oil change vouchers
1047 2018-12-03 22:17:36 I needed a excuse to drive down to Seattle for some shake shack so I’m like I’ll get a oil change and bmw of Seattle wanna be booked till next Monday  
1048 2018-12-03 22:17:32 Why God gave them a Prophet and Oil ,Divine Mistake.

1051 2018-12-03 22:17:15 Dear @JustinTrudeau Spend billions creating alternative energy infrastructure, not pipelines. Help oil workers find jobs in alternative energy.
1052 2018-12-03 22:17:09 Kaneh Bosom was used in Jesus Christ's Holy Annointing Oil and is Greek for Cannabis. Pharma in Greek means Evil Magic." This Pill blocks that and makes you have to take this. Like going to the Mechanic who creates another problem for you to have to bring car in again #cndpoli
1053 2018-12-03 22:17:07 I getchya.
What would really really be useful is that region running out of oil and a reduction of our reliance on it. 
Good for all people!

1054 2018-12-03 22:16:55 Snake oil salesman!!!! Sad tiny human you are.
1055 2018-12-03 22:16:52 Dear @JustinTrudeau Canada has the opportunity to be a strong leader for climate change. Please leave the oil in the tar sands, let people get used to having less - the alternative is nothing for anyone. 12 years. That’s all the scientists give us.
1056 2018-12-03 22:16:50 Showering , moisturizing(face/body) (Shea butter , Coconut oil + Hemp oil), blasting music while drawing/painting, or exercising nude 
1057 2018-12-03 22:16:34 why was miz cracker cooking with oil naked I have questions.
1058 2018-12-03 22:16:28 Seriously, I'm a virgin! Where do you think they get virgin olive oil?
1059 2018-12-03 22:16:24 My boyfriend just took my car to get oil change...tells me not to worry about paying for it  I’m obsessed
1060 2018-12-03 22:16:18 The permanent oil painting perfume is coming back to my life
1061 2018-12-03 22:16:16 @Plantlifeinc I'm looking buy the dual essential oil diffuser. In the long run how do I change the tablets so I can use different oils. Are they washable to add new scents as I can't find refills anywhere?
1062 2018-12-03 22:15:41 I have.  We, and nature, will adapt.  Oil demand is still rising for another 20 years.  Renewable tech isn't even close yet.  If you want less CO2, support nuclear power.
1063 2018-12-03 22:15:38 What can I say. I've got a lot of hard mileage. Lol. I worked oil patch til Trudeau Sr killed that. Joined the forces & did soldiering 14yrs. Then became a tradesman until now. Broken bones, injuries & injuries from hard work. Even a few fights while in the army. Good times.
1064 2018-12-03 22:15:25 起きるの遅れると5様の放送を電車で聴かないといけなくなるから明日は早く起きないと……
1065 2018-12-03 22:15:23 Cannot wait till these losers run out of oil.
1066 2018-12-03 22:15:20 Why you do this? Grasshopper oil companies will be able to tell their shareholders that profits down because of this cutback. Is this the reason you do this? @OilGasCanada I'm curious. Don't use the cheap oil excuse either. We've been giving it away for decades. @jkenney

1068 2018-12-03 22:15:16 You don’t need oil for any of those things. I took my furnace to the curb in 2015. EV’s are so much more edgy than ICE’s and they are available in all sizes.
1069 2018-12-03 22:15:16 the part that Oil is also my Oil is such a nonsense!! So if the Oil is also my Oil, how do I get my share? Oh..got it...free medication!!! High property taxes!! High income taxes!! Expensive energy! Expensive education!! and the list goes on!
1070 2018-12-03 22:15:12 Yeah that might be something! I just use lots of water. Would love to use oil but can't stand the smell :/
1071 2018-12-03 22:15:06 Hush with thy common sense & logic! 
The oil is running out!
It's a burden!
Drink your juice & wheesht with your facts. 
1072 2018-12-03 22:14:58 How do you get that in Texas? I know CBD oil is legal here, but only under very limited circumstances, specifically, kids with seizures. I have no problem with full on recreational use. It’s not for me, but who am I to tell others they can’t have it?
1073 2018-12-03 22:14:35 #SourceOfTheDance
Chanukah, complicated, not all that important in the grand scheme of things, but definitely fun, and who doesn't like a good solstice "light coming to darkness" celebration?
The 'miracle of the oil' may be a later interpolation, and potatoes are new world
1074 2018-12-03 22:14:21 五十肩さん、お誕生日おめでとうございますよい一年になりますように。
1075 2018-12-03 22:14:10 @scottstanford1 has @mrgweather told you the real story about Chanukah? The original Chanukah was when he was told to buy oil for the menorah. G only would pay for one night. But it lasted for 8 nights. He's been trying to get same deal since.
1076 2018-12-03 22:14:04 You must go through lots of oil
1077 2018-12-03 22:14:03 Umm.. 100% of oil revenue or oil taxation revenue? There is a big difference—at what point are you planning on nationalizing the oil industry?
1078 2018-12-03 22:14:02 So I am so confused. You are reducing production which harms the ant oil companies like @suncorenergy @ImperialOil that have set up their business model properly. You are reducing revenue flow for @YourAlberta which means we borrow more from banks and pay interest. So?? @jkenney
1079 2018-12-03 22:13:56 so one preparation is pretty basic: serve good smoked eel (or salmon!) cold over hash browns with quark whipped together with lots of fresh chopped dill, black pepper, and some dill-infused olive oil, plus a sweet mustard and a wedge of lemon
1080 2018-12-03 22:13:30 I wonder how much oil revenue he thinks he’ll get from oil companies & Putin. I imagine it’ll be just like that tower Putin ‘promised’ him.
1081 2018-12-03 22:13:29 If the oil’s running out, why’s he still in the oil industry? Anyone with that amount of money would have started moving out of an industry that he believes doesn’t have a long-term future.
1082 2018-12-03 22:13:29 Here we go with the oil prices again. Negotiate on one end and lose on the other.
1083 2018-12-03 22:13:24 He's basically Hillary. He lost to an extremely unpopular Republican. And he's in the pockets of Oil. Israel, Insurance, and Wall Street.
1084 2018-12-03 22:13:19 Who's self interest was being served when bitumen extraction from the beginning did not use Nuclear power? Not 2 late to switch to nukes. The oil sands will be in production for generations. Turn the surplus gas in to LNG, ship it to Asia to replace coal. A win for the planet
1085 2018-12-03 22:12:56 Shoulda turned off the taps to B.C. to give them a taste of an pipeline-free environment and the lack of oil, especially the bunker oil the ships in port use.
1086 2018-12-03 22:12:55 Just like war in the middle was for oil
1087 2018-12-03 22:12:54 I think we had one of these in the shop last week for an oil change.
1088 2018-12-03 22:12:49 They get $$ from oil. They don't care about progress or clean air.

1090 2018-12-03 22:12:22 First time a politician done a good thing! This is because of Oil prices!
1091 2018-12-03 22:12:14 He’s in bed with the oil companies to destroy the earth for the globe. What a loser!  Get him out!
1092 2018-12-03 22:12:11 This McConnel man rubs me the wrong way. He looks like snake oil salesman
1093 2018-12-03 22:12:09 おはようございます(*^^*)
1094 2018-12-03 22:12:04 Heid I too want both companies to do well, but there needs to be some sense of realism. People are being misled by false statements like Angus 'perforating 4 times the KL thickness of HH'. Just not true - the limestone layers are very similar. Much of the 200m is in shale clay.
1095 2018-12-03 22:12:02 Volunteer State Mass Choir - Fresh Oil
1096 2018-12-03 22:12:01 It’s only disproportionate because deniers know that even if they put money into studying it, they’d come out looking bad. That’s why oil and energy companies put money into ads that discredit these studies rather than performing research themselves.
1097 2018-12-03 22:11:55 ah, the religious climate gang are praying again... Do you all get to these "summits" via wooden boats, walk, how do you do it.. You wouldn't be using any Oil by-products would you????
1098 2018-12-03 22:11:46 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower
1099 2018-12-03 22:11:42 Nice shot, but depressing. I wonder if the sun splashes are highlighting oil or other pollution.
1100 2018-12-03 22:11:32 Do they contain palm oil? If so, perhaps the 1% should go to conserving orangutans and their habitation
1101 2018-12-03 22:11:29 Double cleansing it's a must, exfoliate 2-3 times a week, apply your favorite oil and layer it with bunch of moisturiser, sleep mask and sheet mask everyday

1102 2018-12-03 22:11:19 Venezuela’s troubles are in large part a result of the economic warfare conducted against it by the US and of its own mistakes in economic policy, principally debt in US $ and over dependence on oil. They have little or nothing to do with socialism.

1104 2018-12-03 22:11:10 The border is 1954 miles long. If you built it 10 feet wide by 30 feet high, the cost comes to $17 billion in cement alone. And don't forget about the engineering fees and the man hours. If you think the wall will only cost $21 billion, I've got some snake oil to sell you.

1106 2018-12-03 22:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza of the day will be: burning crust with damp coconut oil and pepperoni.
1107 2018-12-03 22:11:04 Well, I got $7500 from the federal rebate. $3000 from the state of Maryland. The initial cost of the car was about $31K, I think. No routine tune-ups, oil, gas, etc. I need to drive my daughter in a few minutes, so I don't have time to figure out the cost/benefit ratio now.
1108 2018-12-03 22:11:02 Making your own mayonnaise is really easy and tastes delicious.   Higher quality eggs and oil make a big difference.
1109 2018-12-03 22:11:01 This! Peppermint oil on the temples, back of the neck and under the nose! (I also put it behind my ears) one of my fav helpers for migraine!

1112 2018-12-03 22:10:55 Qatar's withdrawal from OPEC to be the drug broker to sell Iran's oil
1113 2018-12-03 22:10:46 cus we count the oil we force them to produce for us as ours 
1114 2018-12-03 22:10:42 That's irrelevant,skirt around it as much as you like,the fact is he would probably be still alive today if he hadn't of invaded Kuwait for the oil fields and to cleanse it if it's people,it should have been finished 1st time around and saved us all from the bs of Iraq 2
1115 2018-12-03 22:10:39 The whole goal of the climate nutters and our GLOBALIST PM 

Is to keep our oil in the ground- reducing production is a win

For them.

1116 2018-12-03 22:10:34 He is doing the exact opposite. He is hoping OIL prices rise. I wonder how you with all the expertise you have can insist that one incompetent septuagenarian from 30 years ago is the best in the age of globalization?
1117 2018-12-03 22:10:30 Albertans and their political puppets want to continue thriving in their oil industry.  NEB and the courts did their job and JT has more work to do.  But you’d have to be ignorant and arrogant to think that rape culture and violence is not an issue on this types of projects.

1124 2018-12-03 22:09:59 Maybe that's why Siison's kitchen got bought for $200M by Kraft? 

I make my own mayo with avocado oil.

1127 2018-12-03 22:09:42 oil
1128 2018-12-03 22:09:41 That is all true. Oil is a big deal.
1129 2018-12-03 22:09:32 Obama is delusional, or thinks the U.S. is. This guy did everything to block domestic oil. Banned off shore leases,banned pipelines, banned Alaskan drilling, and many more , and now wants credit for increased U.S. oil? Just shut up and go away, Pleeease.
1130 2018-12-03 22:09:24 The price of this oil change 
1131 2018-12-03 22:09:11 五棟を越えたあたりか全部外注。

1132 2018-12-03 22:09:08 You had no such reluctance in law school! But it’s ok. No matter what you say, you cannot match in creativity and sheer imagination the use of profanity downrange in Iraq. To paraphrase a Christmas Story, those guys worked with profanity like Michelangelo worked with oil paints.
1133 2018-12-03 22:09:06 Because Erdogan hopes for cheap oil from Venezuela.
1134 2018-12-03 22:09:03 Sjw's: drilling in Alaska is terrible, you're gonna use up all the oil before we have enough alternative energy solutions in place!

1135 2018-12-03 22:08:56 Glad I did my oil change yesterday I would’ve been freezing outside rn
1136 2018-12-03 22:08:51 Oh, that makes sense. I wasn't sure if there might be a special ingredient in them representative of the lamp oil. I haven't had much exposure to Jewish traditions, but I like to learn.
1137 2018-12-03 22:08:48 Okay, I am 100% obsessed with peppermint essential oil—it is pleasant, clean, and refreshing 
1138 2018-12-03 22:08:33 Every single item sold at Tastee Freez is no less than 15% frying oil by volume. Shakes included.
1139 2018-12-03 22:08:32 Groundnut oil
1140 2018-12-03 22:08:29 I thought one strength of supply side mitigation was that it does not directly hurt the consumer/voter. Stated another way, hurting oil companies is progressive; hurting oil customers is regressive.

1145 2018-12-03 22:07:54 We do not need israel to continue living. We just want control of the ME so we can call all the shots on the oil. And that’s about as far as that relationship goes.
1146 2018-12-03 22:07:52 Painting horses with acrylics. Not because I chickened out again with oil pastels, but because I've got this one chance to send my cousin a Christmas gift and I gotta do it.
1147 2018-12-03 22:07:49 I think I used too much essential oil in my diffuser and burnt my fucking sinuses
1148 2018-12-03 22:07:40 I think I saw something about rubbing chalk on it and leaving it for awhile to try to pull oil out of the fibers. Or talc. Do they even sell talc anymore? lol
1149 2018-12-03 22:07:25 First order:

1150 2018-12-03 22:07:23 With their backward thinking, no they won't do it. They couldn't assent to Paternity leave,  will they do for marijuana? 

They don't read at all nor carry out economic research. 10 years after Ghana and the likes approves before they start deliberating. For now is Crude oil.
1151 2018-12-03 22:07:22 Currently have lavender oil on my sheets, lavender pillow spray, lavander body cream, lavender tea and lavender sleep balm on my temples and I’m STILL awake

1153 2018-12-03 22:07:16 Tea tree oil can help remove tags with a simple dab applied a few times a day, helps tighten the tissues and shrink tags if the become painful due to clothing rubs.
1154 2018-12-03 22:07:16 Try carrot oil
1155 2018-12-03 22:07:00 So basically this is all about spin stories IMO. We get less revenue. We pay more to banks for money we now borrow as we have less money. Good oil companies like @suncorenergy @ImperialOil screwed for doing their due diligence. Ants are punished for failures of the grasshoppers.
1156 2018-12-03 22:06:57 Same here! Apparently heating systems account for much of the oil/petroleum consumption in Switzerland.
1157 2018-12-03 22:06:57 I don’t really cook but , Truffle oil is the bomb.
1158 2018-12-03 22:06:54 THC makes me extremely paranoid. I have tried CDC oil without any benefit. I am sick of the government removing or limiting my choices. My father served in the Air Force for 20 years to protect our rights while containing government overreaching. What happened?
1159 2018-12-03 22:06:44 We’re the world’s largest oil producer 
1160 2018-12-03 22:06:41 murray’s edge control is the perfect balance between cantu (doesn’t do shit) and olive oil (does too much)
1161 2018-12-03 22:06:41 Just olive oil...
1162 2018-12-03 22:06:38 Energy stocks surge as US crude oil jumps 4.3% to $53.14, betting that OPEC meet Thurs will result in production cuts. Mon. movers:

1163 2018-12-03 22:06:35 @TechnicalBard is that why OPEC and Russia are curtailing their own production? There is a global glut of oil right now.  And it’s not surprising that the low hanging fruit in Alberta was the first victim of the market reaction.  Our pipeline issues simply added to it.
1164 2018-12-03 22:06:29 The first Iraq war waa questionable as far as reasoning . Still to this day it wasn't about iraq invading Kuwait.  It was bout oil.
1165 2018-12-03 22:06:26 Venezuela has 300 billion barrels of oil but no potato... #itate
1166 2018-12-03 22:06:20 電車内で飯が食えるほどわたしの神経は図太くない
1167 2018-12-03 22:06:07 I feel like a fast food restaurant just cleaned the fryer and took that used oil and poured it on me like a winning football team throwing the Gatorade on the coach.
1168 2018-12-03 22:06:02 Close - I paint and weather the Alpha Legion colours on the shield, varnish, sponge on masking medium, paint the Fists colours, take off the masking medium, then highlight the chips and add grime. For the bodies, it's all sponge chipping and oil washes.
1169 2018-12-03 22:05:55 What oil do you use?
1170 2018-12-03 22:05:54 We haven't been getting value for our oil mostly. @OilGasCanada  US companies that refine our oil get full value so why y'all quibbling about value now? Isn't this more about caving into those oil companies that aren't doing well? Cover the butt of their CEOs? @jkenney agrees?

Don’t worry, I got the oil and gas bar this year.

1175 2018-12-03 22:05:32 Tea tree oil helps heal cuts faster and lavender helps with headaches and migraines.
1176 2018-12-03 22:05:26 I hope you also reminded them that baby oil is not, in fact, made out of babies.
1177 2018-12-03 22:05:16 I also don't pay for oil or gas changes, radiator fluid, antifreeze, or even tune-ups, and no broken parts in an engine. My electric bill went up about $2 a month. I needed a new tire, windshield wipers, and wiper fluid. That's it.
1178 2018-12-03 22:05:11 Bet his is not ending subsidies for oil companies.
1179 2018-12-03 22:05:09 True. I also add hemp oil (CBD) via vape sometimes. Not sure if it helps or not. I take the green strain Kratom during the day & red at night.
1180 2018-12-03 22:05:00 I need to dive in a bucket of coconut oil, this winter already turning me into bag of dead skin

#DareToBelieve
1182 2018-12-03 22:04:56 Do we know what oil companies are the ones doing the tests? I’d love to not buy gas from them ever again.
1183 2018-12-03 22:04:53 U could get tea tree oil from anywhere
1184 2018-12-03 22:04:45 Because not relying on oil, reducing emissions that contribute to climate change and smog, improving public health and reducing ecological damage are such elitist concepts. I forgot the right doesn’t understand or believe in science.
1185 2018-12-03 22:04:36 Potato salad! (Although we use mayo and not the oil and vinegar potato salad I had in Fredericksburg when I was in TX.)  And macaroni or a pasta salad of some kind.  And lots of fresh veggies.
1186 2018-12-03 22:04:27 
1187 2018-12-03 22:04:22 Oh i wasnt supposed to put canola oil.... Oh well.
1188 2018-12-03 22:04:17 OK - just wish there were more transparency with that. So are conservation organisations now palm oil plantation owners as suggested by some? The paucity of cases of clearing coming before the RSPO suggests it is ineffectual. And the deterrence is ineffectual. Sanctions only?
1189 2018-12-03 22:04:02 The efficient use of taxpayer money isn't unsustainable oil investments.

Canada post makes a net profit, so these hysterics about taxpayers is unfounded nonsense.
1190 2018-12-03 22:04:02 If you actually believe an app will drive down prices I have a bridge for sale. If our politicians actually wanted petrol affordability we would already have it. Fact is they have sold us out to big oil. Qlders can pay as much as 20c per litre more than southern states! Why?

1194 2018-12-03 22:03:44 I'd be willing to bet money that the "loud Sun Chips bag" story was propagated by like, oil companies because those bags were compostable
1195 2018-12-03 22:03:43 Oil. Hanukah was a holiday made up to keep celebrating the Marduk December 21 feasting holiday that they learned during the exile in Babylon.

There’s the story you can look up about oil lasting 8 days in the Temple. So the holiday involves eating fried food because oil. 
1196 2018-12-03 22:03:37 It is thanks! and I will be stocking upset Woodlea :)

1199 2018-12-03 22:03:34 3. Clearing up the oceans and protecting the reefs and wildlife. We're very quick to resource conflict and war over oil, resources or even an idea, while we watch the planet die. Shame.
1200 2018-12-03 22:03:33 Is palm oil even used for its taste? I wouldn’t know. I don’t know much about palm oil. Know a lot about different palms tho. My favorite is definitely the Areca palm. Looks great in most indoor spaces that have the room for it
1201 2018-12-03 22:03:31 Regardless of what flashy terms or words they use on the bottle pigmented hardware store spray paints all seem to be oil based, which means they take forever to cure and if they're used on parts that are going to be handled a lot they'll become soft and gummy over time. Bummer.
1202 2018-12-03 22:03:29 It's just another pretty obvious way to denigrate Trump.
 "GHWB was such a good man. Not this prick Trump"
But you're 100% right. When he was president these same frauds were accusing him of being a war profiteer,  deliberately and gleefully sending men to their deaths for oil $$

1218 2018-12-03 22:01:49 I made the mistake of buying snail when I went there. I could have sworn the snail was alive cause there was no salt. No seasoning. Just plenty oil that could be used to fry plantain for 20 people.

1221 2018-12-03 22:01:33 "And Hezekiah welcomed them, and he showed them all his treasure house, the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious oil, his armory, all that was found in his storehouses. There was nothing in his house or in all his realm that Hezekiah did not show them." 2 Kings 20:13 whoops
1222 2018-12-03 22:01:26 おはよ～
1223 2018-12-03 22:01:21 Again agreed - however there is a line between supporting and doing the job for them.  If I don’t put water in my car, don’t clean it, check the oil or tyres and then I crash it’s my fault.  Some parents don’t do the equivalent with their kids yet we are told not to blame them.
1224 2018-12-03 22:01:16 Refusal to admit that the oil industry isn’t our saviour any longer is the problem.

1229 2018-12-03 22:00:50 Iran nukes vs Israel, US war N Iraq&Afghanistan. It ALL ties 2 oil, w/lesser factors also involved. The world runs on gold&oil. Golds been replaced by currency, 4 the most part, but NOT oil. Saudis accept dollars 34 their oil. If they refuse 2 do so, US could suffer a GREAT loss.
1230 2018-12-03 22:00:50 Every ticket should come with an oil change and car wash
1231 2018-12-03 22:00:45 Nice, should be a cheap oil change

1234 2018-12-03 22:00:34 The creative team are not normalising child sexual assault or paedophilia nor are they on the road to doing so. To suggest they are even potentially going down that route is so far off the mark we might as well be on an oil rig off the North Sea!
1235 2018-12-03 22:00:32 At this time of year, Jews across the world retell the story of Hanukkah and how a day's worth of oil lasted for eight days.

We call it a miracle. 

The Koch Brothers call it a nightmare.

1240 2018-12-03 22:00:19 Makes sense as so many people in Texas work in the oil and gas industry.
1241 2018-12-03 22:00:19 Happy Hanukkah @ASavageNation May everybody’s inner Oil Burn Bright...
1242 2018-12-03 22:00:15 My skin is honestly at the mercy of my hormones BUT my recent holy grail products:  Alcohol-free stridex, jojoba oil, Mizon All-In-One snail repair cream, Mizon Intensive Ampoule, and L'Oreal Rosy Tone Mask have REALLY kept my skin happy, and when it's angry, it's not *as* angry.
1243 2018-12-03 22:00:15 Oil.......Oil oyul. 
Its not freaking oral! You fry crap in oil and oral is something you will probably never experience in life other than running your mouth.
1244 2018-12-03 22:00:05 Ladies, if your man:

- is a sugar refinery
- is a plant
- is related to rafinerija
- is an oil refinery

He's not your man. He's a refinery.
1245 2018-12-03 22:00:03 Much of the recent stock market decline was the result of hedge funds selling stocks to raise cash to meet margin calls on their declining oil futures positions.

1246 2018-12-03 22:00:01 The Toronto Sun is Postmedia. They are owned by an American Hedgefund comp and the National Enquirer. Their mandate is to support oil companies and push American Conservative politics on Canada. It’s a rag not news. Know your sources.
1247 2018-12-03 22:00:00 Isn't actually free, AND is it possible to download a US version of eyes of heaven on the floor, especially not full of oil.

1256 2018-12-03 21:59:32 same happened to me yesterday. bought some "olive oil" mayo online and it came 40% olive oil and 40% rapeseed oil!!!!!
1257 2018-12-03 21:59:31 unless you are using an old oil furnace, coal, or old woodburning stove, it is completely unnecessary.
1258 2018-12-03 21:59:30 In some of the best oil too

1260 2018-12-03 21:59:17 It really isn't. Oil is going to run out. The shift to an economy based in green tech needs to happen now, otherwise you get left behind. That's what is going to happen if people like you remain so poorly informed.

I don't like the arguing of Angs and Ukog. I want both to do well.
Why shouldnt they?
1263 2018-12-03 21:58:39 Justin is attempting the top down approach my imposing carbon tax policy, but some provinces are fighting it. Like Ontario’s conservative government.  He is in a tough spot because many jobs depend on the oil sands out west. I’m pro nuclear. There are options.
1264 2018-12-03 21:58:21 Hot oil + deep conditioning treatment. Treating myself tonight.
1265 2018-12-03 21:58:20 Remember Captain Philips movie, w/pirates from Somalia? RIGHT ACROSS from Yemen, where the Saudis R @ war. US oil ships targeted 4 $ N that movie. KEY access point 4 shipping US oil 2 Israel, all bounded by Arab nations. Arab nations MAY cut off her oil 1 day, over Palestine!?

1267 2018-12-03 21:58:13 And this is why we don’t drink olive oil.

1269 2018-12-03 21:57:56 Nothing bud...with 100% of NS oil revenue we would cruise it. Encourage investment in Scotland that would otherwise go to London and the South East. Cmon...glass half full...we’d romp it eventually 
1270 2018-12-03 21:57:52 Alaina, Billions being added to our debt every week with NO END IN SIGHT. Loosing $80 million / day in Alberta, >$300billion in lost investment and counting. 100,000+ laid-off in AB, no pipelines, importing Saudi oil. Maybe you should listen to what's happening to our country!
1271 2018-12-03 21:57:51 My nose and chin are very oily, so I tend to get more blackheads around that area. I use charcoal masks on the oily areas and then I try to use hydrating masks on the drier areas. And before bed lately I’ve been putting tea tree oil basically all over my face. It’s helping.
1272 2018-12-03 21:57:34 You're focused on a name when what you should be focused on is finding some baby oil and another barber.......
1273 2018-12-03 21:57:32 I went to subway and got something different for a change

Steak, buffalo chicken, cheddar cheese (all toasted), fresh spinach, jalapeños, mayo, oil, vinegar, and black pepper

Lets see if its good 
1274 2018-12-03 21:57:30 We need to cut demand before we cut production. I think we all know in our hearts that a large part of the solution is going to have to rely on innovating our way out of this. That will require investment, which we will be much better positioned for if we have oil money
1275 2018-12-03 21:57:29 Well, the amnesty programme is on and the ministries of Niger Delta and NDDC are getting funding. Illegal oil refining is still on. People are making money. Drawing comparison is a bit like a face-saving technique by you though.

1277 2018-12-03 21:57:23 I tried 18 different meds.  Almost died from a few horrible side effects.  I’m so happy for you!  God willing I’ll be able to say that someday.  
11 years and all I needed was cannabis oil.   Thousands, wasted on doctors ...glad the madness is now over :)
1278 2018-12-03 21:57:19 I know you've never heard of "setting a good example" but it is aspirational, and helps to improve things outside of its direct area of impact. Also green technologies are going to be massively important for far longer than oil will be.

1284 2018-12-03 21:56:53 meanwhile, I artfully paint a single pair of boobs with choppy, oil-paint-like  strokes and my blog gets marked as explicit even though art of boobs doesn't breach the guidelines. RIP.
1285 2018-12-03 21:56:47 You must be from alberta still fighting for oil despite climate change.
1286 2018-12-03 21:56:41 The Hasmoneans for sure did not have potatoes, and the people in the Pale for sure did not have olive oil, and honestly historical authenticity is overrated and I'm just happy to be here eating fried potatoes.
1287 2018-12-03 21:56:36 Actually they pump a water mixture into the ground to force the oil up, because oil floats on water.  This can cause pressure differences
1288 2018-12-03 21:56:23 If going gluten free cured autism it would be shouted from the rooftops, peddling snake oil should be decried. 
The stuff I see in here is shocking...MMS to kids, slapping therapy, kids dying due to homeopathy for sepsis...that’s what ignoring real evidence can lead to.
1289 2018-12-03 21:56:23 We use heating oil to make our house nice and toasty warm in the winter. I wash my walls every Spring.
1290 2018-12-03 21:56:01 when we run out of oil, we can burn all that stuff we rake off the forest floor. why doesn't the Fake News media ever talk about that? #VeryStableGenius #RakeAmericaGreatAgain
1291 2018-12-03 21:55:59 Depends on what you’re making, it only takes about a teaspoon/tablespoon of oil.
1292 2018-12-03 21:55:53 1) a vicars daughter politician for a political party

1296 2018-12-03 21:55:17 A lot safer than deep fry! I already wondered why there was no oil in it. 
Enjoy!
1297 2018-12-03 21:55:12 Hmmm... Can I start with truffle oil and work up?
1298 2018-12-03 21:55:10 Oil via Mediterranean Sea seems much more difficult. If U wanna squeeze a nation, cut off access 2 NRG produced elsewhere. THAT could B the means of requiring a peace settlement 4 Israel! Oil. Israel needs green NRG even more quickly than USA, & were OK, 4 now. Theyre neg w/oil!
1299 2018-12-03 21:55:09 Thinking hard bout hittin this oil field in elpaso I’m tryna run this  to the sky 
1300 2018-12-03 21:55:08 We could also remove various subsidies from fossil fuel exploration and use. A freer market would kill coal faster and would probably also put a dent in oil exploration.
1301 2018-12-03 21:55:04 Continued boycotting of palm oil would force governments to do that. To legislate & enforce. Supporting the RSPO is in some ways worse than doing nothing as it gives the false impression that deforestation is under control. The RSPO has only the capacity for sanctions - toothless
1302 2018-12-03 21:55:00 He took his oil paints
& began gently
Stroking the canvas
With the tip of his brush
As though caressing her every curve
Those soulful eyes
The colour & the hue
Melted his heart
Moments of passion
Lasting impressions
Engraved in his soul
Forever a painting of love

1303 2018-12-03 21:54:57 I am openly standing on the works of others, everyone is. You and I admit as much and most do. Those selling books like Powers or Maltbie or McCormick acknowledge the people they have admired and sell because that is how they make a living. As long as they don't sell snake oil
1304 2018-12-03 21:54:50 Actually I’m accusing him of creating new law to disrupt oil patch. Saying he’s simply following law when he’s specifically created the roadblocks is incredibly disingenuous. He’s had the ability on every one of those items to make path simpler instead he’s chosen obstruction
1305 2018-12-03 21:54:49 Don’t the dudes at Valvoline know that when they show me the stick with the new oil that I have no idea what the hell I’m looking at let alone if it looks acceptable or not

1317 2018-12-03 21:53:50 @algore question for you Mr Gore, in shipping there is a big debate about cutting emissions from burning fuel oil in ships by using scrubbers. What’s stopping the coal power industry trying something similar on their power planets. Make coal cleaner. ??

1326 2018-12-03 21:52:52 The "poor numbers" likely refers to Scottish oil taxation revenue over the last couple of years in particular—remember that UK collects oil taxation revenue (tax rates cut at SNP's insistence), whereas Norway's oil fund was built on taxation and profits of state-run industry.
1327 2018-12-03 21:52:49 I use baby oil
1328 2018-12-03 21:52:47 Food banks in a oil rich Nation like Scotland or even little England shows Conservative polocies are transcending way beyond their wildest expectations. In any other Situation it shows that Government Duty of Care has failed #ToriesAreKillers

1329 2018-12-03 21:52:41 No it's just as absurd.  If they get a beautiful woman with no crows feet to advertise make up to hide crows feet... that's still fake without one bit of digital retouching.  If you do not know these ads are fake snake oil crap by now... nothing is going to help you.
1330 2018-12-03 21:52:35 He's in Texas, oil land, and the money he took came from individuals. He never campaigned on not taking money from people from the energy sector, though he does talk about climate change and clean energy jobs quite a bit.  Maybe he will do it differently if he runs for president.
1331 2018-12-03 21:52:32 By a huge margin. After the 1973 crisis, Europe incentivized diesel cars in order to save on imported oil. Most cars since have been diesel.
1332 2018-12-03 21:52:32 Don't be fooled by the pretty flowers on the tub. Canola is 100% GMO. It stands for: CANadian Oil Light Acid.
1333 2018-12-03 21:52:29 Yes time will tell. I believe both companies are still learning about the Kimmeridge, yet Angus posters on LSE claim to be confident that Brockham will flow easily and constantly at >1,000bpd - 'yesterday'. And that this one site will make the company worth £100's of millions.
1334 2018-12-03 21:52:28 Easy to make your own:
1 egg
2 teaspoons of Dijon mustard
3 teaspoons of lemon juice

Now put 175ml of avocado oil in a bowl. Add the above ingredients. Put in immersion blender in. Turn on.  As it turns white slowly withdraw the head of the blender over 20- 30 seconds. 

Done.
1335 2018-12-03 21:52:26 Seeing data on the energy sector in Nig, and our limited in-country capacity to process our crude oil, gives me straight headache. Just tiring .. you can’t tell me nothing, PDP should not be returning to power. And I’m not an APC advocate so don’t even come for me.
1336 2018-12-03 21:52:20 The subsidies go to CONSUMERS, not the companies. I have a fully electric car., so I know. By the way, my car costs me nothing for oil, gas, radiator fluid, no scheduled checkups or broken parts, there's zero maintenance other than brakes, tires, and windshield wipers/fluid.
1337 2018-12-03 21:52:16 Any private citizen who made a donation to him will have declared the company/organisation they work for. If they work for an oil or gas company(even as a receptionist or janitor) their donation is recorded as "oil and gas".

1342 2018-12-03 21:51:39 Renewable energy is also good for the economy because... it's renewable. It won't run out. Building an empire on a dwindling resource (like oil) is an assured strategy for failure and disaster. Renewable energy is the *only* viable future we have.

1346 2018-12-03 21:51:09 publicly shaming companies on social media can get results. 

in business, the squeaky wheel gets the oil.
1347 2018-12-03 21:51:07 Look up the journalist, he makes his living critiquing the oil sector, hardly impartial but a good fit for a biased publication like the tyee.
1348 2018-12-03 21:51:01 Many of the things destroying our country from closing of our factories, wars of "choice," jacked up oil prices, world terror, did not exist before the #BushFamily led us into them, culminating in the Great Recession. They don't get enough credit for the suffering they caused.
1349 2018-12-03 21:50:52 @BarackObama I heard you on C-span bragging about "that was me, people" in terms of increasing America's oil and gas production. Shameful. Do you keep up with the science on climate change? What happened to you? @billmckibben @RevDrBarber
1350 2018-12-03 21:50:52 How about the plant closing in Michigan and Ohio? And many of those workers were tricked into voting for your snake oil pitch! Just curious! Tell Putin that I said hey when you talk to him again!
1351 2018-12-03 21:50:25 Alhamdulillah
1352 2018-12-03 21:50:18 Obama put restrictions on the oil & coal industry, Trump got rid of the restrictions. Obama's trying to take credit for the oil and the great economy.

1358 2018-12-03 21:49:31 Just wait till the equalization payments from Alberta start to dry up and Quebec doesn't get the $12 billion they got last year.
Those Liberal seats won't be so safe once they figure out who killed the oil economy.

1359 2018-12-03 21:49:23 So you are even against Alberta oil companies, who do not agree with you. Interesting. Perhaps, other companies would be in better shape if they had followed their leads.
1360 2018-12-03 21:49:20 Politically it may have been more difficult then. Now with China first dealing with other countries buying oil in Yuan for 4 yrs now then starting Shanghai Oil Futures Contract in March, EU is more emboldened to make the move politically. Also good timing to announce after G20.

1362 2018-12-03 21:49:04 Bahrain's Oil Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa Al Khalifa announced its biggest discovery of hydrocarbon deposits in decades, estimated to be at least 80 billion barrels of tight oil and between 10 and 20 trillion cubic feet of deep natural gas.
1363 2018-12-03 21:49:01 But trump is sure he's a very fine person, after all he gave him a great deal on oil - what's a hacking to death between friends?
1364 2018-12-03 21:48:46 Waiting for my damn oil change

1366 2018-12-03 21:48:39 @juliemason Climate change is not incompatible with business. The reason the Republicans deny climate change is the contributions they receive from the oil, gas, and coal companies to fund their campaigns. The root problem is campaign finance.
1367 2018-12-03 21:48:35 what do you use to moisturize? i currently use coconut oil and vitamin e oil
1368 2018-12-03 21:48:31 Paul took the car to get the oil changed and is now getting the tires rotated on his day off  it’s the little things that continue to remind me of how lucky I am to be with someone like him 
1369 2018-12-03 21:48:31 As of 2013 Israel was importing ~100 mln barrels of oil/year. It possesses negligible reserves of crude oil but does have abundant domestic natural gas resources which were discovered in large quantities starting in 2009, after many decades of previously unsuccessful exploration
1370 2018-12-03 21:48:08 Why don’t we plant forests as ‘carbon capture’ vehicles? The Amazon rain forest is being destroyed and this was always referred to as the world’s lungs. Jungles are being replaced with palm oil production. Rather than subsidise sheep production on poor land, plant forests.
1371 2018-12-03 21:47:53 everytime i need to save money i have to get an oil change

1373 2018-12-03 21:47:49 Do you count on the government to protect you from countries that would attack us? I have an idea that will make the oil companies happy. Let’s make sure that all cars get no more then 10 mpg. I doesn’t make any sense not to develop alternative energy. Don’t drink the kool aid.
1374 2018-12-03 21:47:39 Recently I’ve set up a 401K, changed my oil and tail lights myself and set up a savings plan to move out. Feeling like a real adault and not to sure how to feel about that.

1377 2018-12-03 21:47:17 No.  Trump has lowered oil prices to the point that small cars aren’t selling as well as fuel hogging SUVs.

1384 2018-12-03 21:47:02 Jn Walvoord postulated Tribulation would center on pressures over oil. Saudi Arabia has the most. Israel doesnt have a ton, but Russia will seek its wealth ~2.5 years N2 the Tribulation (Battle of Gog). Even 2day, Arab nations R fighting over religion & oil! Sunni, Shia & OPEC.
1385 2018-12-03 21:47:00 Can we end the oil depletion allowance too?

1389 2018-12-03 21:46:40 Poor numbers? $1trillion oil fund...poor numbers? You’re a crackpot 
1390 2018-12-03 21:46:36 Yes, we're holding the planet hostage for interests of the oil industry, I see what you mean. Planetary ecological collapse, so a tiny contingent of shareholders gets theirs.
1391 2018-12-03 21:46:31 bro have you ever tried CBD oil? it'll fix that ill feeling and also make you happy and smarter and stronger you should really try it
1392 2018-12-03 21:46:31 会ったらね( *´艸｀)
1393 2018-12-03 21:46:30 Very sensible.. so why not say that..why all this maybe he did maybe he didn’t..spouting off about oil prices when we get more oil from Canada.. why all this capitulation..Trump came from a place of weakness in dealin with this
1394 2018-12-03 21:46:28 Yeah yeah niggas want that ass , not just to rub oil on it what kinda porno scene you living in
1395 2018-12-03 21:46:23 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
1396 2018-12-03 21:46:22 Because of the unlikely end to all co2 emissions and the real threat of increased emissions due to permafrost defrosting and increaaed oil usage, perhaps the focus should be on ways of shading the atmosphere rather than going to Mars right now?

1399 2018-12-03 21:46:10 Wow thank you for showing me the importance of cuticle oil
1400 2018-12-03 21:45:55 Bernie is much more progressive than Beto. Not to mention Beto is bought by the oil industry.
1401 2018-12-03 21:45:46 Since petro is still a major source of energy, cheap oil should jumpstart more investment and more productivity. What changed is our new environmental policy which has shackled the excess energy.
1402 2018-12-03 21:45:26 CBD oil, anxiety piercings and bracelets have been a big help for me dealing with anxiety plus I did away with all food coloring, caffeine, gluten and things that speed up my system and I use deep breathing techniques. It’s worth the fight

1404 2018-12-03 21:45:18 What are you talking about? NATO was created to provide security against the USSR. And I’m sorry but all these wars the US has been in havent been for freedom, they re to make money for the elite and control the oil. Im sorry if they told u otherwise.

1407 2018-12-03 21:45:09 Does #DavidAttenborough think celebrities should stop travelling to international talking shops, thereby cutting logically our use of oil.
1408 2018-12-03 21:45:09 The is a need to form a new oil organisation that will exclude countries that had imposed blockade on Qatar @JZarif @RT_com @Iran
1409 2018-12-03 21:45:02 The pound is just as much Scottish as it is English! Anyway, keeping the £ helps keep the UK afloat, without the oil the £ will be worth nothing.
1410 2018-12-03 21:44:58 Have you ever roasted broccoli? Toss with olive oil, salt & pepper. Spread evenly on sheet pan. 500° oven, turn on broiler when you put in the broccoli. Check after 7-ish minutes. Finish to your liking; tender w/ some crispy edges. Kid asks for this all the time. Baby devours it.
1411 2018-12-03 21:44:56 It’s ok to say that. I mean ignorance and low thinking skills make folks vulnerable to all kinds of snake oil salesmen.

1413 2018-12-03 21:44:47 Will exporting oil to where ever these clients are lower the price in BC, NO. So who cares.
1414 2018-12-03 21:44:45 Something had to be done. At the rate things were going, Santa was going to be leaving barrels of Alberta oil for the naughty kids instead of coal, as a cost-saving measure. #ableg
1415 2018-12-03 21:44:42 Today I tried an “Organic-Deodorant”. Started my day smelling like Teatree oil, Chamomile, and Lavender. By lunch i smelled like a funky ass 12 year old prepubescent boy, with under tones of “outside”, hint of paprika, old boiled hot dog water, and ear ring backs. #ThankUMonday

Pasta should be cooked in water with some garlic alt and a tablespoon at most of olive oil
1421 2018-12-03 21:44:12 Third, renewable energy can be produced pretty much anywhere on Earth. It doesn't concentrate the supply into the hands of a few powerful oligopolies - the Saudi Arabias (oil) & Russias (gas) of the world. 

Renewable energy reduces international friction by reducing dependency.

1423 2018-12-03 21:43:58 Oven-baked latkes are a shande. Not only must they be fried in oil (um, that's the point, duh), one should grate the potatoes preferably by hand.  (The extra skin adds flavor!)
Chag Sameach!

1432 2018-12-03 21:43:18 I see they had an oil sands campaign in 2010 and the last article I found about it was in 2012. I take it those are old photos and you wouldn't know their stance if you didn't remember or look specifically for this info. I assume there is no current campaign for people to know.
1433 2018-12-03 21:43:00 They are killing people, attacking our democracy, working together to raise oil prices, & bro-ing out over it all; while America refuses to stand up because Trump has personal financial interests & the GOP likes 1% tax cuts & SCOTUS justices who drink beer with PJ and Squee.
1434 2018-12-03 21:43:00 Membership isnt the issue and you know it. The company has been poorly managed for quite sometime and has thus far provided little room for evolving. The future is not oil and we all know it.
1435 2018-12-03 21:43:00 If it is not in the local palm oil jollof rice then something big is missing
1436 2018-12-03 21:42:58 Recover from what exactly?  4% economic growth?  Low unemployment?  Better/fair trade deals?  Defeating ISIS?  Low oil prices?  Low taxes?  Yeah, you need to put a stop to this!  Its called #TDS  and you have a bad case of it.
1437 2018-12-03 21:42:48 Petrol prices are too low. Climate scientists say we have 12 years to end the age of oil befiore it ends us.
1438 2018-12-03 21:42:44 It won't stop until the oil companies stop producing plastic. We have other alternatives and of course it always comes down to money. It has to start at the top where the real issue is.
1439 2018-12-03 21:42:44 I dont think they realise that there would have to be a degree of 'state involvement' the Norwegion oil co. is Statoil, clue in the name. Otherwise its just the revenue from any profits hence the poor numbers over the years.
1440 2018-12-03 21:42:34 About 100 miles south of Midland TX, heart if oil/gas country, there are massive wind farms.

1442 2018-12-03 21:42:21 @SeloSlav  What is the best way to savour olive oil? Drink it neat, eat on plain spaghetti, dip white bread in it?
1443 2018-12-03 21:42:17 Eurozone shares +1.3%, US shares +1.1% on US/China G20 trade truce & Kudlow comment re US/China pretty close to some agreements on IP theft & tech transfer.

1444 2018-12-03 21:42:14 @ASavageNation PURE oil, ie. still sealed and uncontaminated.
1445 2018-12-03 21:42:13 Exactly. There are inherited and earned national assets that are not the possession by any section of society. eg North Sea oil; university IP etc. They’re supposed to be for the general good. They were gifted as tax cuts. We are now a poorer and indebted nation. Pure folly.
1446 2018-12-03 21:42:12 Yet Trump has done the following:

Armed Ukraine

Pushed Merkel to stop buying Russian Oil/Gas

Pushed NATO to increase defense spending

Hit Russia with sanctions

Bombed Russian ally Syria

Ordered attack on 200 Russian mercenaries in Syria

Increased US oil/gas output
1447 2018-12-03 21:42:10 I understand what you mean. I had real gardenias in my wedding bouquet. Also, you can purchase gardenia essential oil.
1448 2018-12-03 21:42:01 Orangutans also rapidly losing territory in Sumatra as rain forests cut down to make way for palm oil plantations
1449 2018-12-03 21:41:56 No lifted sanctions!  US oil production way up!  World oil prices way down!

Putin must love those developments.
1450 2018-12-03 21:41:47 Correct. Even those that say they use olive oil have seed oils. Primal Kitchen has the only decent one I know of.

1455 2018-12-03 21:41:30 OH Jimmy - Jimmy - Jimmy: How can you cast aspersions on this great man who started out with a simple lemonade stand, expanded without help into an oil executive and then became kindest, most sincere & loving man the world has ever known? (Info gleaned off the many TV eulogies)
1456 2018-12-03 21:41:30 Mmmm, didn’t you tell me a few weeks ago that the oil was running out?
1457 2018-12-03 21:41:24 The heads & shoulders shampoo is okay but I’d say oil it every other day
1458 2018-12-03 21:41:22 Just now leaving work and now I have to go get an oil change

1462 2018-12-03 21:40:49 I roasted some with broccoli tonight. Douse in sesame oil, cracked black pepper, salt, and garlic granules, roast for 20 mins and give a light toss halfway through. Super yum.
1463 2018-12-03 21:40:48 Looks like cormark has also done many deals with Defrancesco - like co-leading the sale of his oil company ‘Devalvco’ which owned 3 blocks of land in Columbia - for $27 million back in 2009.
1464 2018-12-03 21:40:45 Peace is like $100 oil. More ephemeral than we think. Especially as states “weaken”
1465 2018-12-03 21:40:44 Palm oil is hard to avoid, it's everywhere, needs careful reading of labels. Iceland advertising they're cutting it from their own label products

1467 2018-12-03 21:40:42 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1468 2018-12-03 21:40:36 Carbon pricing is as much to get environmentalists  to support an incrementalist approach to dealing with climate change... Revenues from oil exports to China will finance the infrastructure needed for a new low-carbon economy. You can’t see the big picture. #skpoli

1474 2018-12-03 21:40:05 Overheard while getting an oil change.

"Honey, if you ain't got a good mother-in-law, you ain't got shit."
1475 2018-12-03 21:40:01 Secondly, pollution, like gas emissions and oil slicks, is really bad for our health and the health of the countless animals cohabiting our planet with us. Not only is renewable energy great to combatting climate change, it is also greener and safer for us to use.
1476 2018-12-03 21:39:58 my mommy getting my car an oil change :)
1477 2018-12-03 21:39:52 No.. it's all the jobs Obama created when he made us the#1 oil producing nation in the world. 
1478 2018-12-03 21:39:46 @keithgerein  Kieth, I worked for 2 years developing business relationships to sell oil equipment onto up coming leases in Alberta. In one Ignorant Policy "My Fair Share"  Stelmach all of the wells I waited for were CANCELLED. $300,000. vapouized! All the money went to Sask.
1479 2018-12-03 21:39:46 a wise man once said that when the President issues an executive order, Paul Ryan silently writes a song about #love
1480 2018-12-03 21:39:45 Did you see the video this morning of the oil tanker from Pakistan that was intercepted on its way to Iran? It was full of small children. Looks like they steal the children then sell them to the evil in Iran. Child Brides, pedophilia, wickedness.
1481 2018-12-03 21:39:43 Yep. Use some of that oil money and bury some rebar in there! LOL!
1482 2018-12-03 21:39:37 Was curious to see how much product value I’ve worked on during my time at my current job. Comes in at just over 10 million with 6.9 worth of oil and gas in just the last year
1483 2018-12-03 21:39:26 Iran ,Qatar,Venezuela will exclude Saudis in future oil organisation.

1486 2018-12-03 21:39:12 Nobody is destroyed by a pipeline. You are engaging in leftist hysterics. It is the safest way to transport oil.

The alternative is to buy Saudi blood oil, tanker it in to the east coast, and truck/rail it across the country on a highway system that bisects many native lands.
1487 2018-12-03 21:39:10 ぎゅーってしてちゅーしてほしいいいい…
1488 2018-12-03 21:39:03 It’s the oil for the oil that kept the candles alight <vague explanation I read on Twitter>
1489 2018-12-03 21:38:56 My point was that pipelines there get protested too. They fulfilled their goal when they 1st found shale oil by becoming self-sufficient. Bitumen is more expensive to extract/refine & royalties/taxes were too low to invest in them! Albertans didn't have goals, a plan, or savings!

1501 2018-12-03 21:38:02 What are all the reasons that people hang onto their cars and their driving, and how could those needs be met differently?
(If I were an oil industry mole, I'd try to advocate radical sacrifice (and not explain why) without offering good substitutions, to make people angry.)
1502 2018-12-03 21:38:00 This is ridiculous.  One person, especially this person, should not be able to dictate a country's efforts on saving the planet. We're out of the Paeis Accord, only one to not sign the G-20 climate document, and now this. tRump definitely in the pocket of big oil.

Listened to music like an affirmation

1510 2018-12-03 21:36:58 One can be a prosperous country again. Crude is more of a curse to us than a blessing. We rely so much on oil yet, we are not an “oil rich country.” We have to go back to the good old days when agriculture is the driver of our economy.

1519 2018-12-03 21:35:24 There is also a revenue problem. Will not be solved by @OilGasCanada as all political parties puppets to oil industry; will have to be solved with a PST. It's not the only way. We could increase income tax but I guess this would not go over well. A PST is the best way with cuts.

1521 2018-12-03 21:35:05 Hmm... in order to build up an oil fund Norway maintained high levels of personal and corporation tax, and borrowed heavily—is that what you want: high taxation and foreign borrowing?
1522 2018-12-03 21:34:59 When I give cash to a political campaign it's as an individual donor.

It is not as a representative of the corporation that I am employed by.

To sit here and watch these neoliberal jagoffs try to pretend like this isn't bribery by oil&gas companies is sickening.
1523 2018-12-03 21:34:57 Ok that is good BUT what about the oil industry and automotive industry this Government needs to start supporting Canadian business and not destroying it

1574 2018-12-03 21:30:13 When oil is bought, it's consumed. Same goes for most every other commodity. But not money(gold). Gold doesn't cease to exist once used. It can be used to bid up oil with another purchase - time and again.

One view into why the quantity of money doesn't determine price level.

1580 2018-12-03 21:29:45 Well, to be fair, that approach did get me home. Whereas, if I'd dipped the stick at some point, I would have found myself having to find engine oil late on a Sunday afternoon. That would make motorway petrol look very cheap...

2) By what mechanism does foreigners stepping away from treasury auction cause US trade deficit to rise?

1604 2018-12-03 21:26:52 well, most olive oils highly processed and/or are cut with one of these industrial oils such as canola oil even though they claim is it’s cold pressed extra virgin olive. i would avoid olive oils.
1605 2018-12-03 21:26:49 history also dictates the gas/oil prices come down tooo when they rise...!! hilarious logic  !!! do go on
1606 2018-12-03 21:26:44 The middle class in France are livid because Macron is raising the fuel tax to reduce their carbon footprint. It’s NOT because of an increase in fuel costs. People paying attention know oil prices are falling. Won’t hear that on MSM.

1611 2018-12-03 21:26:21 Peak oil will hit around 2040 or sooner. It's not growing. The only reason we import is because we don't have enough refineries to process bitumen. That won't ever change.

1622 2018-12-03 21:25:18 But you got to understand we need oil... otherwise you will be the first person to come out and cry on high fuel prices. I understand humanity concern in this but why the onus should be on us to be tough with the saudis? Why is developed world not doing enough about it?
1623 2018-12-03 21:25:17 In my experience it has been #UKOG ramping. Broadford Bridge did not flow. We await final analysis of HH. Time will tell whether Kimmeridge production was better understood by #ANGS
1624 2018-12-03 21:25:14 Really contemplating on just going back to the oil field and doing my own thing again.
1625 2018-12-03 21:25:11 Trees at the backgroud are looking like an oil painting. Nicely  captured.
1626 2018-12-03 21:24:54 Thx.Baines was buying a lot and if they stick to that case and have dry powder they should continue buying with both hands. Like a far otm call option on oil prices. Central question: insolvency risk. Call options available , IV high.Real problem:max expiry only till 6/19.
1627 2018-12-03 21:24:53 Did you make the diagnosis, then sold them the snake oil, took their money, and then took the diagnosis back? If not, please provide proof for you lies... Ahem, claims.
1628 2018-12-03 21:24:49 Being ready means be watchful; not only the signs, but our spiritual life also. We should be taking steps to spend more time in prayer and Bible reading. I examine myself daily in the case I’ve offended the Holy Spirit. In other words, keep your lamps full of oil.
1629 2018-12-03 21:24:31 I don't have time for your oblivion. You are just clueless. You say things like that and obviously don't know who donates to Rs =Oil, Guns, Coal. The exact reason they won't fight climate change or control guns. They are controlled by big money. Done. I need to work. Bugger off.
1630 2018-12-03 21:24:31 Former president of Shell Oil Company John Hofmeister said former President Barack Obama had nothing to do with America’s increased oil production and actually frustrated many areas of the energy sector.
1631 2018-12-03 21:24:29 If you support advances in solar and/or wind technology you support big oil too? C'mon Kev, be less lame
1632 2018-12-03 21:24:22 Wow the worlds a better place in Lala land !!!!!!  I would go there but then I’d have to be harassed, treated less than because I’m a female, be separated from my family, and ALSO have no rights!!!! But I’d have a right to a gun and a oil field job 
1633 2018-12-03 21:24:10 Would need a huge oil rally to do that
1634 2018-12-03 21:24:10 I actually make an essential oil bug spray that works well
1635 2018-12-03 21:24:10 - Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer SPF 20 (the regular not the oil free)
- Laura Mercier translucent loose powder
- Laura Mercier eye basics primer
- hourglass ambient lighting powder in dim light
- diorshow overcurl mascara
1636 2018-12-03 21:24:07 People have lost confidence in snake oil salesmen
1637 2018-12-03 21:24:06 Same guy that told people scotland had no oil and took payoff from tories and by the looks of it still does. only a moron would believe 1 word from an industry as small as fishing who make thier money selling fishing rights instead of actually fishing.
1638 2018-12-03 21:24:03 All companies that control oil,gas,coal, electricity,petroleum are extremely powerful & don’t care about the environment.These criminals control governments around the world & unless we find a new political party state and federal nothing will be done to save the planet.
1639 2018-12-03 21:23:55 I dunno, I'd kinda like to see them settle it in a ring while covered in baby oil and wearing lingerie.
1640 2018-12-03 21:23:50 Head over a bowl of hot water with a few drops of olbas oil, under a towel. Brilliant!
1641 2018-12-03 21:23:45 Brilliant!  Oil demand keeps growing, don’t build Cdn pipelines and global demand is met with other less environmentally friendly supply w/o carbon pricing.  and Mother Nature lose. 
1642 2018-12-03 21:23:44 Not taking issue with the name per se...just the whole entire Teen Mom franchise really. Clearly we have more to do than glamorize these girls for bad decisions, CBD oil notwithstanding.
1643 2018-12-03 21:23:24 I don't necessarily disagree, but I have a hard time figuring out how we can meet the timelines we need to while hitching our wagon to more oil. We have 12 years to cut emissions.
1644 2018-12-03 21:23:22 Beto apparently receives an enormous amount of money from the gas and oil industry. THAT'S a presidential credential, especially in association to Obama.
1645 2018-12-03 21:23:08 And what do you do to help the environment? Why do gas prices not rise and fall at a commensurate rate with the cost of oil? Why do you post record profits every single quarter?
1646 2018-12-03 21:23:01 I would drop the Nutella bit. Prime users of Palm oil and Sugar. These crops are destroying the environments of South East Asia
1647 2018-12-03 21:22:53 Allah fa.. Way we know sef
1648 2018-12-03 21:22:52 Girls who use coconut oil have the best pussy
1649 2018-12-03 21:22:52 Oregano oil, curcumin, coconut oil, herbal tea, honey, lemon. Drink lots of high alkaline water.
1650 2018-12-03 21:22:45 Freedom of movement, abides by EU rules... an insanely rich country due to oil. NOt dependent on exporting anything but OIL...

1655 2018-12-03 21:22:20 #PINOF10 is corn oil is made from corn and vegetable oil is made from veggies. WHAT IS BABY OIL MADE OUT OF!1!1
1656 2018-12-03 21:22:15 The coconut oil you can mix with aloe vera, works really well. And also you can sprinkle rice water on hair.i use that alot
1657 2018-12-03 21:22:10 You got oil in your car
1658 2018-12-03 21:22:01 Dear @cathmckenna it is time to stop this pointless charade of talking climate action while supporting oil development. Oil is a resource we MUST ignore and take the opportunity to revolutionize the energy industry. Be a real leader please.  #COP24
1659 2018-12-03 21:22:01 Have you tried #CBD oil? If you have questions, DM me:) It helps us!
1660 2018-12-03 21:22:00 Probably. I broke the dipstick off today doing an oil change.
1661 2018-12-03 21:21:59 Hope you talked about his exploiting gold mining and oil interests
1662 2018-12-03 21:21:31 Oil is by far the most exciting market for me at the moment and has been for a while. So many fundamentals underlying and influencing price movements:
1663 2018-12-03 21:21:13 Hmm, though not Jewish, I can tell you as a blonde who's always had temperamental autos (Triumph Spitfire, Porche924, BMW 2002) I wouldn't push my luck with a check oil light. Plus it's easy to check and fix. Save yourself, the headache, Steve! And happy #Hanukkah 
1664 2018-12-03 21:21:02 Another FX intensive area is import of oil. Give a plan to all car manufacturers to start producing hybrid cars within the next 2 - 3 yrs.
1665 2018-12-03 21:21:01 Lol even for my street how many people 
1666 2018-12-03 21:20:55 Note reference to miracles (plural). There was just one miracle-a night's worth of lamp oil lasting eight. Idea of miracles (plural) comes from Fox contributor & End Times fanatic, Rabbi Tuly Weisz who has decreed various Israeli victories over Palestinians as additional miracles
1667 2018-12-03 21:20:39 They don’t want an oil fund...they’re fukn weirdos pal
1668 2018-12-03 21:20:36 Hahaha omo iya teacher 
1669 2018-12-03 21:20:28 still not worse than putting olive oil on fresh bread and adding heaps of sugar on top
1670 2018-12-03 21:20:27 Peak oil- oil companies are losing their grip on things - the Saudis too. So they are scrambling to drag their financial death out as long as they can. That means attacking environmental legislation & regulation
1671 2018-12-03 21:20:25 See this mumu amcon debtor, are you not the same people sponsoring the media houses in Nigeria to twist his words?
1672 2018-12-03 21:20:16 Peppermint oil on her fingers ... #SavedYouAClick
1673 2018-12-03 21:20:09 Wow oil too?!?
1674 2018-12-03 21:20:04 That is oil. Oil.
1675 2018-12-03 21:19:50 Coming up tomorrow morning:

 - We'll be joined by @Andrew_Adonis and @CGreenUK to debate @theresa_may 's Brexit deal. 

-  Peter O' Shea from @ESBNetworks on why we should get rid of oil and gas heaters in our homes

- We discuss climate change with John Fitzgerald
1676 2018-12-03 21:19:50 The products are made with cbd oil. Not that that makes it any better but I guess provides a little bit of background
1677 2018-12-03 21:19:50 The unveiling of Canada's NJT camp roster is the day when everyone points out the "snubs." From an Edmonton perspective, Oil Kings' Trey Fix-Wolansky and Oilers prospect Ryan McLeod are notable omissions. If Canada wins gold in January, no one will remember this day. If not ...
1678 2018-12-03 21:19:48 Ask the leaders to just have refineries there for all the oil they keep exporting cheap but buy it back as gasoline (or petroleum idk). Wait, we have a similar problem here with the gold and other minerals, never mind, they won't listen.
1679 2018-12-03 21:19:42 Am I a real artist now that I'm working on an oil painting while wearing Doc Martens? Is this what art school was supposed to feel like?
1680 2018-12-03 21:19:09 #mazdausa Bad experience2013 @mazdacx5 took it to @OceanMazdaDoral for AT, Low tire pressure and track control warning ck engine light. Needs new transmission a 5K job. I’m not paying that $. but they charge me oil change and tire rot on a dead car. No more Mazdas for me 2 enough
1681 2018-12-03 21:19:07 Canada's golden goose? Lol.  Toronto's GDP is 5 times larger than the tarsands.  Canadian oil companies pay some of the lowest taxes and royalties in the world and are heavily subsidized.
1682 2018-12-03 21:19:06 I guess you never heard of Debbie Wasserman Schulz.   Also, look at the polls.   He's still has the most support as a candidate.   I also guess you never heard of policy.  Hillary- against gay rights, universal health care.  For weapons for Saudi, corrupt bankers, oil companies.
1683 2018-12-03 21:19:04 U really don’t take context do u. It grew under Obama? Why was that? Because of Osama bin Laden...his anger & then his death. We all knew that killing him would spring up new ones everywhere.

As well as the repercussions of Bush & the war that shouldn’t have been over oil.
1684 2018-12-03 21:19:04 Why does nail polish taste like olive oil
1685 2018-12-03 21:19:02 To me it feels more like trying to put out an oil fire by splashing water on it.
1686 2018-12-03 21:19:01 Trump administration is drilling 4 oil in pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska during our current EARTH CRISIS thanks to #ClimateChange. DRILLING FOR OIL IN #ALASKA WILDLIFE REFUGE. This is a sick, horrible, massive story; PLS cover in news media!
1687 2018-12-03 21:18:56 オイルbotって何⁇とよく聞かれますが、…オイルはオイルですYO
1688 2018-12-03 21:18:55 They're not gonna stop selling oil abi? they just leaving the cartel. Will defo increase competition.
1689 2018-12-03 21:18:47 According to your friend Compound, an iScot would not have an independent oil fund because over the last 3 decades tax collected only covered deficit in 6 years.
1690 2018-12-03 21:18:28 I really love my mom, even though we like water and oil, she really does anything for me..

1693 2018-12-03 21:17:56 #Hooligans i'm taking today off. I want to finish Darksiders III but we were out for 2 hours grocery shopping/getting my oil changed and we just got home. Also, my back is in severe pain and I didn't sleep at all last night.

I'm just too exhausted to entertain today. I love you.
1694 2018-12-03 21:17:54 I like them because I only eat foods that come packed in oil
1695 2018-12-03 21:17:48 Cooking oil Pilao Omelet B Degi 
1696 2018-12-03 21:17:48 We have tried CBD oil Indiana only recently started legalizing anything so we are limited here! Most of his pain is from failing lungs but he does have meds to help its illness that hurts the most.
1697 2018-12-03 21:17:36 I'll say this again the meeting in Trump tower was a brokered three way deal to assume world domination the three way 
Putin Trump & Mbs (Saudis) both countries will be supplied oil for this purpose of what's looming in the future with American military standing with putins army
1698 2018-12-03 21:17:32 I naively thought that he would immediately tell public that we ate now drastically confronting our oil consumption & usage & we must face reality of dependencies & USA violent offensives in that regard & change course NOW.
He didn't. I was run into the street gravely injured.

1705 2018-12-03 21:16:31 Thanks. It’s a Hannukkia as a menorah has one fewer candle and the hanukkia has one for every day that the miracle pot of oil lasted plus one to use to light the candles. Fun fact!
1706 2018-12-03 21:16:29 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
1707 2018-12-03 21:16:26 Yeah. Banderism & Russian are like oil & water, but I honestly don't know how "Slavic" Banderite fascism can be considered.
1708 2018-12-03 21:16:16 Interesting that the largest shareholder in a Canadian Rail Co. that transports oil would be interested in climate change.

#disingenuousnerd
1709 2018-12-03 21:16:14 Not bad for a first attempt, eh! As for eating them cold, got no problem with that. It's the mayo. You need sharp to balance the oil! Anyway, enjoy. Nom nom...
1710 2018-12-03 21:16:14 These countries are making an active and determined switch to renewable energy. It would be unthinkable to simply stop all oil production and consumption because the economy needs to be weaned off it.

Your solution is... What exactly? Keep sucking on the pipe till it's empty?

1715 2018-12-03 21:16:03  it’s impossible sir , the oil revenue we got under IBB, Abacha , OBJ , UMY & GEJ is a little less than $1 trillion
1716 2018-12-03 21:16:03 Dear @JustinTrudeau it is time to stop this pointless charade of talking climate action while supporting fossil fuel development. Oil is a resource we MUST ignore and take the opportunity to revolutionize the energy industry. Be a real leader please.  #COP24
1717 2018-12-03 21:15:50 Unlike @GeorgeHWBush today's @GOPrepublicans push policies that only help rich congress members, a few of their constituents and wealthy bank, oil, chemical company and pharmaceutical company donors. @GeorgeHWBush championed the Clean Water Act, The Disability Act, and more.

1719 2018-12-03 21:15:39 I can't taste anything. You could serve me pancakes with cardboard and motor oil and I wouldn't know the difference.
1720 2018-12-03 21:15:28 OIL when you’re tweeting federalist links, you’re losing.

You guys just can’t get away from the sweet sweet candied meth that is the federalist can you?

1724 2018-12-03 21:15:05 And we didn’t spend on infrastructure, we subsidized oil industries, made rich investors, richer, starved health & education, while paying doctors significantly more than anywhere in Canada.

We are sick of libertarian lies.
1725 2018-12-03 21:15:03 Globalization, climate change, energy, fuel, oil, anti-capitalism= increase taxes all connected.  Failure!!!!!!
1726 2018-12-03 21:14:30 I'm sure I'm going to regret this, but  . . .

With modern horizontal drilling where's the danger to the Refuge?  I don't even remember that last surface oil spill in this country.
1727 2018-12-03 21:14:23 Stocks rally broadly, but off early highs for the day, as US and China pledge trade truce.

Dow ends +288, +1.1% to 25,836, highest close since Nov 9. Nasdaq +1.5%, S&P +1.1%, both to highest since Nov 8.

Crude oil jumps 4.5% to $53.20 on production-cut hopes.
1728 2018-12-03 21:14:22 Oga inside me is as deep as when oil is been drilled. So u know nothing
1729 2018-12-03 21:14:21 When people are asking about cbd oil & who sells it thanks to everyone who tags me in really appreciate it
1730 2018-12-03 21:14:20 In fact, Butts blocked me from twitter cause I called out his crap - but you don't need to believe me- wait and see if it ever gets built and then decide which of us is the conspiracy theorist- my money is on you.  Carbon Tax was to replace the revenue lost on the dead oil sands.
1731 2018-12-03 21:14:19 The "cure" (even more time with Scotty) is both the cause of the disease and a side-effect. This snake oil salesman is just trying to dupe us again, and I'm sick of it.

1734 2018-12-03 21:14:02 What is his rationale? Who benefits? Not gonna just take his word. God he is bad at this. Big oil has him by his microscopic nuts.
1735 2018-12-03 21:14:01 Those are actually tools for smoking cannabis and dabbing hash oil. The roach clips and dab tool are a dead giveaway.
1736 2018-12-03 21:14:00 Rather than creating a fast low-carbon transition, the Canadian government is going the opposite way by buying a pipeline and has decided to protect the oil industry rather than the future of children and younger generations. #COP24 #ClimateActionNow
1737 2018-12-03 21:13:48 I’ve told the people who do my oil changes the past 3 times I’ve gotten an oil change that I’ll get my spark plugs changed next time.. well sorry guys it’s next time again 
1738 2018-12-03 21:13:40 Being asked to explain how you achieved the unachievable isn't trolling.

Calling you a snake oil salesman? Possibly.
1739 2018-12-03 21:13:37 Would go through as legal or something. Bc this is texas, many of his donations were likely from people who work for oil & gas companies.
1740 2018-12-03 21:13:36 Sir Ian 'no oil but loads of fish' Wood...
1741 2018-12-03 21:13:26 Yeah, but Norway didn’t piss their oil revenues against a wall. Or sell their state oil company for some magic beans.
1742 2018-12-03 21:13:22 I’m finding it hard to unlink the true reason for Small Doctor’s arrest  from when he said “Buhari ye ma sun”.
They say arm possession and threat 
But you know that adage about “no be when Small pikin pour  oil”....smth smth
1743 2018-12-03 21:13:22 Omg imagine how much uglier I’d be if coconut oil didn’t exist 
1744 2018-12-03 21:13:21 Organic coconut oil does wonders 
1745 2018-12-03 21:13:18 Sir, I am here again . According to history , Jews ( very few ) won a war against a king's big army & recaptured their sacred place. When they wanted to lit the candle , they found the sacred oil available over there was sufficient to last for a day only but it lasted for 8 days.

1748 2018-12-03 21:13:02 Can't wait until we can start suing climate change deniers and big oil for reparations.
1749 2018-12-03 21:12:36 I use a probe ( no jokes ) 

A deep frying saucepan. 300ml of vegetable oil. I go to around 140c not to hot mate. 

3 minutes either side.
1750 2018-12-03 21:12:33 So about this coconut oil rub down tho
1751 2018-12-03 21:12:26 He has given explanations + he’ll absolutely do town halls for 2020. His donors are a bit misleading. When it says he’s received donations from big oil & gas companies, it’s misleading. It’s saying that people who work for those companies have donated to his campaign just as mine
1752 2018-12-03 21:12:24 Yoo my MAN yoodouble up my feelin wid the oil man the way to get OIl man cus that is where they gettin the oil MAN x

1758 2018-12-03 21:11:47 okay, baby oil gel did the trick for my dry ass skin.
1759 2018-12-03 21:11:42 Albert's low grade oil would not be a problem if global oil prices were higher.
In order to be profitable, Alberta has to sell more of their low grade oil.
A return to high global oil price would solve Alberta's problem as in the past.

1761 2018-12-03 21:11:27 I co-created what is currently a $7B public company. I believe I have some concept of business planning.

Folks such as yourself have no problem borrowing money when it comes to publicly-funding buildings for sports teams or bailing out US OIL companies..
1762 2018-12-03 21:11:20 If a soup has too much salt, it's salty. 

If it has too much pepper, it's peppery 

If it has too much water, it's watery.

If it has too much oil, it's oily. 

Then what of if it has too much maggi?

1773 2018-12-03 21:10:07 Coconut oil. Olive oil. Almond oil. Castor oil.

1777 2018-12-03 21:09:11 They both push violence. Both add oil to the dire. I doubt this creates more support for Macron  at the end.
1778 2018-12-03 21:08:43 The rate of emissions is critical to how many people will persist on earth. The UN says emissions must start coming down rapidly by 2020. At no point has any govt suggested a policy that might achieve that requirement. The IEA says oil use will increase for next 20 years.

1788 2018-12-03 21:07:20 Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Get at least 7 hours sleep. Stress can cause hair loss. Is it NISIM or NHB? supposed to stop hair loss. or close to it. What can I do to spot the official web site. Was sulfate free. Worth the money.

1792 2018-12-03 21:06:55 Well we know that the oil companies (note plural) have their hands up his ass clacking his jaw
1793 2018-12-03 21:06:43 Then we should end oil and gas subsidies also.

1797 2018-12-03 21:06:16 Unequal distribution of revenue seems to be enshrined in the hydrocarbon law.. also to me its astonishing how at the same time people in france are rioting for cheap gasoline while employees inwill iraq run the oil fields

1800 2018-12-03 21:05:29 Imagine if price of oil included actual costs to the environment, as well as the actual costs for the oil wars, including Japan & US oil embargo of Japan triggering Pearl Harbor, & US deposing Mossadegh in Iran ultimately leading to the Mullahs, Iraq War, etc. Oil is too cheap.
1801 2018-12-03 21:05:21 Yes, sure. Is there any different USA? Iraq has an oil, Libya has an oil but Ukraine has a lands to serve USA...
1802 2018-12-03 21:05:18 Reminder that it's Hanukkah, so you should be eating fried foods.

Your body is a temple, and it's time to rededicate it with oil!

 Happy Hanukkah! 
1803 2018-12-03 21:04:34 Healthy direct tax collection can save the India's fiscal maths. PMI at 54 shows fastest industrial output expansion in last 11 months.

1804 2018-12-03 21:04:31 Thought about Bose or Beats but I've never been a Bose fan (snake oil audiophile stuff irks me) and I don't expect Beats to work well with the non-Apple products I own.

1808 2018-12-03 21:03:51 My dog is in pain (she injured her leg) and I ran out of CBD oil and I feel so bad for her. I just wanna help. 
1809 2018-12-03 21:03:43 Hi Jeff, our fuel prices are directly related to the price of crude oil and every store has a varying cost structure from transportation, taxes in certain geographies, to land cost. We strive to offer our guests everyday value while trying to protect them from cost fluctuations.
1810 2018-12-03 21:03:40 When did And why did EQ payments come into being?  Look it up. It was to bail out the west before oil was really discovered. And that’s ok. And I’m happy to do it again if needed.

1814 2018-12-03 21:03:03 Cauliflower, courgette, mushrooms, peppers, red onion, tomatoes... all chopped up, tossed in a little olive oil and chucked in the oven for about 35 minutes.
Delicious! I’m going to be experimenting further with #cauliflower!
What has become of me! 
1815 2018-12-03 21:02:59 Wasn’t sure about the mandated oil production cuts in Alberta so I reached out to my friend that buys and sells crude oil (big time guy) - he said, it’s gay, it’s grey (as in unlimited grey areas) and he happened to add that notley is a stupid cunt - As usual I enjoyed the convo
1816 2018-12-03 21:02:39 There’s more at stake than your friend Sir Don. To save the US you must urge Congress to: immediately stop funding for the Dakota Access pipeline (transferring oil to the alien commie ghouls)emancipate school kids{pay}the Social Security[corporate]wage beginning Headstart newborn
1817 2018-12-03 21:02:24 Nah, it's gonna be one of those give or teach a man to fish deals.

Y'all can thank me later. 
1818 2018-12-03 21:02:22 Random.. recipe suggestion.  Cut up cabbage, slivered almonds, break up uncooked ramen, mix together.  Mix the flavor packet with some rice vinegar, salt, pepper, maybe a lil oil( i tend not to). Mix it all together with diced chicken.  Wonderful Asian Salad.
1819 2018-12-03 21:02:11 Oh goodness yes! I bought my boyfriend a men’s grooming advent calendar last year from ASOS and overall it was really good, but a man does not need three different types of beard oil! (Especially as he doesn’t have a beard ) x
1820 2018-12-03 21:02:04 The disaster that is becoming AB lies squarely at the feet of the former useless PC governments 44 yrs of mismanagement. where was the diversification that would have been a backup if oil failed.
1821 2018-12-03 21:01:55 Gotta get these toes done and a oil change before i leave Thursday!!!
1822 2018-12-03 21:01:52 Why are you not inquiring as to why the oil was all running out and now there’s more than there’s ever been ..... never trust a tory or the bbc ! #thebritishstateatwork
1823 2018-12-03 21:01:52 Who wants to take my car for an oil change while I do all this mf homework :(((
1824 2018-12-03 21:01:51 @SenMarkey Drill baby drill, stop being so fucking anti American. Green energy sucks, billions spent on green energy w Obama. Wasted money. Solyndra, 500 million wasted, how may others. Quit being dumb. Drill for oil.
1825 2018-12-03 21:01:36 Yours is a stunningly superficial perspective that is distracted by the narrative of oil prices. Youre ignoring the underlying inequality.
1826 2018-12-03 21:01:30 Watch out for that mech oil
1827 2018-12-03 21:01:30 Just lining the pockets of the oil companies...  wait, no.  What?
1828 2018-12-03 21:01:23 @JustinTrudeau .  This is so wrong.  People in western Canada are losing thousands of jobs from your governments poor choices and lack of action.   We are giving our oil away for nothing and importing Saudi oil.  October 2019 can’t come soon enough. Canada as a whole is suffering
1829 2018-12-03 21:01:21 Puro bigtime rollback ang mga oil pero yung pamasahe yun at yun din.
1830 2018-12-03 21:01:12 The US doesn't seem to mind refining the oil for a cut of the profits though...
1831 2018-12-03 21:01:03 The same MSM who hated George H W Bush- who mocked him at a supermarket checkout scanner, who bashed him for “oil for money” wars, and portrayed him as a confused out of touch elite in his speedboat & golfing- suddenly are lionizing him, for the single purpose of bashing Trump.
1832 2018-12-03 21:00:53 Facebook tells me on this day in 2011 I visited a girls school, retirement home, cupcake factory, kennels, snow centre, oil terminal, Luton Airport was on a Virgin train to Wigan!  Don’t let @jackbryan8 @Gaz23Brown @24Busterbrown have your phone when driving home from Brighton!
1833 2018-12-03 21:00:37 Instead of doubling down on your error get a history book or any major newspaper from 1991. 

Iraq oil was nationalized both before & after the 1st Gulf War. Warhawks slammed Bush Sr for stopping, returning to the border & not conquering Iraq. Not talking about W’s 2003 Iraq War.

1852 2018-12-03 20:59:47 So George HW is a beloved hero now. Not, like, a tool of the oil industry or anything.
1853 2018-12-03 20:59:42 All those practical skills have deep, long term benefits for real lives of real people. I learned to change the oil in my car, patch the knees of my jeans and cook for myself. I choose which of these skills to deploy or hire out case by case; but the option is mine, every time.
1854 2018-12-03 20:59:33 Thanks tips. I didnt know that most of the provinces services are financed by the oil and gas industry. I guess i have forgotten this since my oil patch working brother who has reminded me of this fact like i dunno maybe 1000000 times in my life

1856 2018-12-03 20:59:21 6.The people of Sokoto today saw the man who also stole part of the PTDF fund and shield from arrested when Ribadu discovered
7. The man whose under his administration as VP 52.1% of Nigerians are in poverty despite booming oil price..
1857 2018-12-03 20:59:21 Taxation vs bills is why North Sea Oil & Gas get £billion in Budgets & no one bats an eyelid. Luckily, Renewables costs now so low that investment made via bills = lower bills & even returns. A new 5GW onshore auction would £1.6bn+ BACK to consumers for their money, for example.
1858 2018-12-03 20:59:17 Toothache is the worst. Clove oil will numb it for a little bit, enough to get you to sleep... And then ibuprofen until you get to the dentist. I also put on a little toothpaste on the area which helped!
1859 2018-12-03 20:59:11 A favor to his polluting coal & oil buddies.
1860 2018-12-03 20:59:10 And the rest of his party takes in millions from the oil tycoons. One shiny cog doesn't change the fact that the Republican party is firmly in the pocket of big business and oil interests
1861 2018-12-03 20:59:09 Tea tree oil!
1862 2018-12-03 20:59:05 Go greener. Wean off of oil gradually like the rest of the world should be. But yes - time to pivot. Going to be difficult but you can do it now or do it later amidst a catastrophic mess (economically and environmentally)
1863 2018-12-03 20:59:05 baby oil? 
1864 2018-12-03 20:59:04 Why not.... we all know USA is having an oil crisis.... so the urgent need to release SPR....

1869 2018-12-03 20:58:25 The administration is moving forward on it's plan to explore oil drilling off the coast of New England. Issuing permits for seismic testing is first step towards building oil rigs off our coastline - which is dangerous and irresponsible.

1871 2018-12-03 20:58:18 We must balance climate change with economic impact. Balance is always the solution. The oil will move by rail (more env. risk) or come from places with terrible human rights abuses. We need balance Herb. The pure environmental impact is not the correct lens.
1872 2018-12-03 20:58:17 try peppermint and/or lavender essential oil

1876 2018-12-03 20:57:40 I agree to a point: you have to re-fry them in at least a quarter inch of oil, and THEN eat them fresh.
1877 2018-12-03 20:57:36 omg I’ve been doing the same  I just been using a lot of oil to keep it from being frizzy >:) but fr tho idk how I’m gonna place it on my big ass head...my high school one didn’t stay on

1892 2018-12-03 20:56:14 Lol love that! Well I think you're idea is a good one.I agree AB would hate it but we should all really get more serious about reducing our footprint.The sooner we turn AB into a green energy province the better for them and everyone.We def have to change our reliance on oil 1st!
1893 2018-12-03 20:56:11 Darker than this oil we just found under the land we suddenly don’t know if you own or not? Because that’s pretty dark.
1894 2018-12-03 20:56:10 More than 3 hours for a *scheduled* oil change is absolutely outrageous @Honda @HondaCustSvc
1895 2018-12-03 20:56:05 As much blame for any voice should lie with the Muslim countries, especially Iran and Saudi Arabia who supply oil to China. I don’t here any outrage coming from them.
1896 2018-12-03 20:56:02 LPT for #derbytwitter folk in cold climes: coconut oil. Put it on your skin after a shower/bath but *before* you towel off. The towel will remove any excess; then re-apply it to problem areas. You can also use it on your face post-moisturizer.

Also kills stubborn derby stank.
1897 2018-12-03 20:56:00 @RachelNotley The lower class (that doesn’t work in the Oilfield) gets a carbon tax rebate. The upper class (Oil producers and CEO’s) are now exempt from carbon tax. But the middle class (who’s largely unemployed and hardest hit by oil crisis) is still stuck paying carbon tax??
1898 2018-12-03 20:55:56 CBD oil has been my saving grace this winter.
1899 2018-12-03 20:55:47 People drive more and buy less efficient vehicles when gas is cheap. The oil industry is active in ensuring gov't policy favors this. You cannot say that the oil industry is a tertiary player. They are the single biggest player.
1900 2018-12-03 20:55:45 She is a little young for that - boiling oil is dangerous! Maybe next year! She'll definitely eat some!

1906 2018-12-03 20:55:14 Sure let's just blatantly ignore that he smashed the record total raised, in a state where oil & gas is a major employer, and yet it was his 17th largest donor industry at 0.6% of his total haul, with every dollar coming from individuals not industry PACs.
1907 2018-12-03 20:54:52 Did you rob grandnut oil on your face 
1908 2018-12-03 20:54:42 Thank you! 
Oh definitely, give it a shot when you can. 

I use Fimo Polymer Clay  Its good quality for the price, and theres lots of vivid colors. Plus, its an oil base clay so it doesn't dry out  until you cure it & hardens. ☆
1909 2018-12-03 20:54:36 The rise in prices of refined fuel is also due to environmentalism.
Demands for cleaner exhausts in shipping have forced refineries to make huge investments, also many ships are transitioning to refined fuels due to environmental demands. This is why oil is low, fuel is high.
1910 2018-12-03 20:54:27 By "Phasing out" oil & gas.  Other energy sectors will be built up & jobs created.  Leaving plenty of positions that can be filled by Oil & gas workers.  Nice try Ontario Proud. NEEEEXT!
1911 2018-12-03 20:54:21 The media's pushing a false narrative that the protests are about the price of oil. It's about Macron’s commitment to curbing climate change, which included higher carbon taxes for 2018. That's the real issue. We are so fortunate that Trump got us out of the Paris Climate Accord.
1912 2018-12-03 20:54:14 The oil industry is able to sell its product below cost because of 4 factors: 1) direct gov't subsidy, 2) cheap access to gov't land for production & transport, 3) risk avoidance via legislated limits on litigation, and 4) geopolitical intervention by gov't.
1913 2018-12-03 20:54:07 do you have a preferred oil based cleanser? I'm a cetaphil gal from way back
1914 2018-12-03 20:54:00 I have always though that the tower was more of a vanity aspect. Don't forget that there is a very good chance that there is an oil component to the deal. Trumps climate denial may be his way of trying to keep oil as important as possible till he can cash out.

1921 2018-12-03 20:53:22 Gratis PR work for a multi-billion dollar industry is like sending an end of year donation to the oil industry. Weird crusade bro.
1922 2018-12-03 20:53:16 into said oil, take finely chopped shallots, couple of cloves of finely chopped garlic, celery sliced into moons like 1/4th inch wide, carrots cut in half lengthwise and also mooned, add salt and saute until it starts to smell nice
1923 2018-12-03 20:53:11 Olive oil was frequently used in Ancient Greece and Rome as lube so that's why it's so popular there lol

But honestly like LUBE FOR GODS SAKE USE LUBE ITS FICTIONAL SO ITS TOTALLY BELIEVABLE THEYLL HAVE IT IN THEIR KITCHEN DRAWER OR GLOVEBOX OR IN THE COUCH OR THE SHOWER OR UNDE

1929 2018-12-03 20:52:13 I took my vehicle to a "reputable" auto shop in my community. I had an unknown slow oil leak. They looked at my vehicle + charged me $100 with a $1,700 + quote to fix. I then took my vehicle to the dealer who charged me $300 total to fix the leak and install new breaks.
1930 2018-12-03 20:52:08 Can we stop subsidizing oil, gas, and ethanol then?
1931 2018-12-03 20:52:04 Yep.  I'd take a Potus that tweets occasional mistake, is a little course at times, but who constantly fights for citizens of the U.S., the country, puts OUR interests first, doesn't back down, or redraw the line in the sand 15 times over a smooth talking snake oil salesman.

1937 2018-12-03 20:51:34 We’re supposed to eat things fried in oil. The donuts are called Sufganiyot, filled with strawberry or raspberry jelly.
1938 2018-12-03 20:51:32 and then, to make a soup out of this- take 4 cups of this broth, which should be a rich dark brown and smell like amazingness, and another 2 of water, and set it aside for a sec. In a big pot heat up some oil.

1948 2018-12-03 20:50:28 I think what was burning was a layer of oil. Technically it was the Cuyahoga River on fire not far from where it flows into Lake Erie near Cleveland. It was 1969 and received national attention but little local news coverage and spawned the clean water act. 1/

1956 2018-12-03 20:49:37 World wide commodity prices???    So you know nothing about oil prices in Canada???    We in Canada get paid $30-40 per bbl less then the world.  That’s because the pipelines aren’t being built.  And that is on JT

Talk is cheap!  What is your plan to get the pipeline built? What is your plan regarding oil prices? Let's hear you?
1960 2018-12-03 20:49:09 And I spit my coffee out, laughing rolling in the floor when Obama said he is responsible for oil prices going down. I've worked with people like Obama before and didn't say anything because the truth will eventually come out. What a  pathetic loser he is.

2015 2018-12-03 20:44:52 Like an iridescent oil puddle 
2016 2018-12-03 20:44:47 OIL??? OH BITCH
2017 2018-12-03 20:44:31 To #MSNBC and #CNN, Democratic stations, suddenly #Bush family most wonderful people in the world so their correspondents can find ways to bash Trump. Bush good, Trump bad. War good? Texas oil good? Bad trade deals good? Oh how great things were as we suffered and so many died.

2019 2018-12-03 20:44:29 Do you think @senatemajldr taking money 
from the oil refiners affects his stance on global warming? 

Here I was thinking it was the scientists 
(in an enormous worldwide conspiracy)
fudging the satellite and ice core data to make money,
2020 2018-12-03 20:44:21 I’m just here for a regular oil change and they’re talking about a trade in. I don’t do anything without my Dad. You whores won’t get me
2021 2018-12-03 20:44:21 โหวววววว เอารูปมาทำให้ด้วยน่าร้ากกกกกกก ขอบคุณค้าบ
2022 2018-12-03 20:44:20 Currency fluctuations have several factors, why? Pakistan Rs took dive!! The only reason when oil price goes down the USD get stronger!! Now a days oil prices are declining and because of this decline all the world currencies took dive, very normal!!
2023 2018-12-03 20:44:16  i told you. Castor oil and hair vitamins. You be back around summer.
2024 2018-12-03 20:44:08 Start your spaghetti sauce with coconut oil and finish with butter. It's magical!
2025 2018-12-03 20:44:06 a family member on oil rig & told me this story. He was appalled. A girlfriend was visiting her boyfriend. A co-worker looks at her, says, "This is a woman I want to rape. Then kill. Then rape again." Everyone went silent. #cdnpoli #AbLeg
2026 2018-12-03 20:44:05 @jimdunlopusa looking at the 65 lemon oil, is it spesialfictlly for rosewood? I have read a few articles about it and “rosewood” was mentioned a few times or is it all darkwood? As i have a ebony fretboard. 
2027 2018-12-03 20:43:56 Helping with what, fat and oil? Don't delude.
2028 2018-12-03 20:43:56 Cbd oil is non toxic and there's no risk of overdose but you should start dosing in low doses and observe for improvement and gradually increase
2029 2018-12-03 20:43:55 OMG We’ve all evolved. Knuckles no longer drag on the ground.The male dominated world of oil and gas is accepting of women and respectful.I worked in it until I lost my job. Notley is greatly to blame but I won’t blame her just because she’s a female.
2030 2018-12-03 20:43:48 I hear you on that one. Sometimes they drown it with the oil.
2031 2018-12-03 20:43:46 bc JT controls the world oil prices  & GM also closed 3 plants in the US, its terrible of them to do so but maybe Harper shouldve put some strings on the bailout they provided for GM... he didn't change any policies that caused these things to happen, tariffs=trump

2033 2018-12-03 20:43:32 The guy at the oil change place just acted like he’s never seen a woman with her makeup done before. Reeeelax.
2034 2018-12-03 20:43:23 Why are so many US #evangelicals so obsessed with sexuality? I'm happy to value and embrace #LGBT+ #Christians. You can keep your right wing politics and 'prosperity gospel'  of your snake oil televangelists too.

2038 2018-12-03 20:43:01 Their current protests have everything to do with oil and the fact they are being taxed to death th pay for all their "free stuff".
2039 2018-12-03 20:42:55 Lavender essential oil. I find it helps when added to a shower or bath water. My other go to is sandalwood essential oil.
2040 2018-12-03 20:42:45 Not sure where my menorah is. Debating attempting a DIY oil one.  I know we have the parts to do it it’s just a matter of finding them and assembling them. Oh #Chanukah ...
2041 2018-12-03 20:42:22 The foundation of the Bush fortune was establish in the thirties. Oil from Atlantic drilling sold to Nazi Germany.  We need real heroes!
2042 2018-12-03 20:42:10 Kroenke wants sustainable financial model and won't inject money like he's an oil nation. And we don't really need City money. Look at United. Plenty of money spent to what end? A brilliant manager and backroom team Emery/Sven/Raul have the money they need
2043 2018-12-03 20:42:03 Man whatever happened to the 19$ oil change.
2044 2018-12-03 20:41:49 Dangerous belief in history rhyming exactly. This ain't Standard Oil.

2047 2018-12-03 20:41:43 So Eddie. How much is your worthless butt paid to be a snake oil salesman for the Church of Scientology? Since an E-Meter has revealed me to be the true heir of LRH. You must answer me! Denounce the wog traitor David Miscavige and follow @MikeRinder and @LeahRemini !
2048 2018-12-03 20:41:41 The flag at BP was half-staff and I heard Jello Biafra shouting "die for oil, sucker!" in my head.
2049 2018-12-03 20:41:33 why does face oil feel like smashing ur face into a bottle of lube
2050 2018-12-03 20:41:16 this is the same person that told us North Sea oil had completely run out & we had to stay inside the UK as we would be penniless

I wouldn't believe him if he told me that snow was white

It did get him his knighthood though
2051 2018-12-03 20:41:10 Need to go get an oil change tomorrow
2052 2018-12-03 20:41:07 #Brent: $61.85 (4.02%)

2053 2018-12-03 20:40:54 And it all depends even how they grew the herb to begin with...  some people use LEAF to make the oil where some use the BUD, and so on some levels you really have to know and trust who you are buying from...
2054 2018-12-03 20:40:49 Of oil? In illinois? Who you know chief lmao

2059 2018-12-03 20:40:15 We're still burning oil and coal, obliterating vast swathes of forest, slaughtering animal to extinction. Either we stop now, or it's going to be a cataclysm. Imagine 9 billion people freaking out because they can't eat or drink. It's where we're headed. Soon.

2066 2018-12-03 20:39:38 An informative assembly from Ella this morning! Inspired by the @IcelandFoods Orang-utan advert about the harmful effects of using palm oil she gave us thought-provoking statistics and a challenge to reduce our use of products and food containing it! #ContributiontotheCommunity
2067 2018-12-03 20:39:35 Also the oil is in a frozen area in Russia that only Exxon has the technology to extract. Hence the Tillerson appointment.

2074 2018-12-03 20:38:57 Since he’s been PM the oil industry has fallen flat on its face—-in Canada and Canada alone.  The auto industry is closing its doors.  The tariffs on metal has quadrupled.     The unemployment rate,,,,hows that doing??

2078 2018-12-03 20:38:03 Thousands of Alberta oil jobs & Ontario auto jobs being lost. Unless the feds come up with a plan, the only jobs left will be in catering location shoots for those schlocky Hallmark Channel Christmas movies... #cdnpoli

2082 2018-12-03 20:37:38 Considering Qatar's contributions within the oil exporting organization being limited makes its departure acceptable and assumable,but looking at it from a breaking off the Gulf business alliance's perspective this means a lot.
2083 2018-12-03 20:37:36 Coconut oil!
2084 2018-12-03 20:37:35 Oil painter ...? How do you paint oil? Oh, you mean the guy using oil paint! 
2085 2018-12-03 20:37:33 Cash & carry. No more credit to marketeers especially now that production is cut. I believe BUHARI led administration of cutting  back on oil relivance and concentrate on Agriculture , roads&power is the best policy of rebuilding NIGERIA which is beginning to   show results.
2086 2018-12-03 20:37:30 As you ponder the ACTIONS of this corporate fascist racist War Hog of a CIA operative,who used his office TO MURDER millions of people for their oil on behalf of the oil companies and arms manufacturers; don't forget his quirky socks.

1. There was no layer of dark brown cig residue
2. There WAS an amazing layer of oil - apparently e-cig vapor residue - instead! 

I never remember that happening before. Was the formula changed? HM
2091 2018-12-03 20:37:08 Make a mixture of sugar and lime juice, then dap with cotton all over. Do not wash with water, try keeping it over night, remove with cream or oil. The more water you use the lighter it will get.

2100 2018-12-03 20:36:10 Never trust what you read by the media types, they are just as bias as the rest of us but are in a position to belie the trust.
Trudeau did the right thing by buying the pipeline after they gave up.
Alberta lower quality oil and a flooded market is not Trudeau's fault.

2119 2018-12-03 20:34:19 But what is Argan oil?
2120 2018-12-03 20:34:18 And u wee be rubbing Ori. Or groundnut oil
2121 2018-12-03 20:34:06 Thx. What kind of oil does it use?
2122 2018-12-03 20:34:00 That doesn't really distinguish though.  For example, Beto took no PAC money, but he is getting dinged for taking "Oil and Gas" money, which I'm sure is a variety of field workers all the way to execs.
2123 2018-12-03 20:34:00 The students simply understand that ASUU are inconsiderate and greedy, they just need more money to buy new corollas , Hyundai and add wives.

2128 2018-12-03 20:33:25 Trump could at least stop arming Saudis to fund a dirty war in Yemen.  At least try to level the playing field between oil and electricity...
2129 2018-12-03 20:33:10 i cant believe my bot like the oil meme going around
2130 2018-12-03 20:33:09 Dr. Joe, eating the right fats is what counts. The margarine - that's highly processed with colouring & additives:  unhealthy. The butter is animal saturated dairy fat: that's not so healthy. But the vegetable oil & certainly cold bottled coconut oil health-wise is ideal!
2131 2018-12-03 20:33:07 No. It's always got to be the one who makes the meaningful move for meaningful peace but when you have billionaires wanting to make more billions from arms sales and oil, the status quo remains
2132 2018-12-03 20:33:01 Try to go get them removed this will be best for your lashes! But if you really cannot go, use oil and steam your face. Do not pull any that are not ready to come out. Your lashes will break!!
2133 2018-12-03 20:33:01 Yesterdays risk on excitement continued into the European and US session yesterday as stocks performed well particularly tech stocks and Oil rallied 7% after this weekends ‘truce’.

2135 2018-12-03 20:33:00 CENOVUS ENERGY CEO SAYS NOW BUDGETING FOR WCS DIFFERENTIAL CLOSER TO $20 BELOW WTI IN 2019 INSTEAD OF $35-$40 BELOW WTI #energy #crude #oil #Canada
2136 2018-12-03 20:32:47 over 0.18+ will fly , and this one has tendency to run 500-200% in few days once oil goes... so lets see coming days......
2137 2018-12-03 20:32:45 Olive oil makes it easier to scrape into the trash can.
2138 2018-12-03 20:32:44 Absolutely absurd. My god this is tragic for everyone in Canada. Veterans, Oil Workers, GM workers, Struggling farmers, Families, Homeless and many more.  I am an embarrassed Canadian today.
2139 2018-12-03 20:32:33 We know it *was* cancelled because of the emissions targets making the project uneconomic. I didn’t mention those targets aren’t applicable to imported Trump oil or Saudi oil didn’t I?
2140 2018-12-03 20:32:31 When you compare the reaction of the fed gov to GM shutting one plant and its non reaction to Alberta’s oil fiasco, it’s maddening.  And unfair.
2141 2018-12-03 20:32:30 Tories, innit. Burn ALL the oil and gas!!! BURN IT!!
2142 2018-12-03 20:32:24 Obviously the fruit pickers  don’t know where The Caribbean is because there is no shortage of Avocados there...Extinct?

2148 2018-12-03 20:32:05 Putin’s wealth is estimated between $100 to $200 billion. Think he’s desperate for a $50 million penthouse? Profit from Exxon/Rosneft would have been many times that. Moreover, Russia’s reserves of easy to get oil are dwindling. Putin needs Exxon to drill the Arctic Sea for him.
2149 2018-12-03 20:31:58 Yes. A standard right-of-center liberal who believes in unrestricted mass migration, killing pipelines, keeping oil locked in the ground, carbon taxes, peoplekind, transgenderism, and  self-identifies as a feminist. 

He's practically Ronald Reagan now that you mention it.
2150 2018-12-03 20:31:48 For your information. The only OML so far renewed by @MBuhari is for Seplat, an indigenous oil firm owned by ND.
2151 2018-12-03 20:31:46 And was wondering about mixing the medicine and oil together at first.
2152 2018-12-03 20:31:44 Spurious rumors sparked historical persecution of Jews. "They kill innocent Christian children and drain their blood to make matzo dough."
It's flour, salt, oil. No blood. Feh!
"He writes for Sturmer."  Uh, no.
2153 2018-12-03 20:31:43 You know all that carbon in fossil fuels? You know where that came from?
Life. Life is carbon, carbon is life. That oil and coal used to be dinosaurs and the rich earth they roamed, but because of the meteorite they all laid down dead at once. And turned into oil.

2154 2018-12-03 20:31:40 Anyway, as a previous great admirer of Mogg I'm afraid he's suddenly starting to sound like a snake oil salesman. He could start a legal firm advising the Attorney General Mogg, Boris & Village Bike Inc.
2155 2018-12-03 20:31:35 Sure, snake oil and mumbo jumbo from a bull shit artist will clear things right up...and you don’t have patients, your not a medical professional. You have fraud victims.
2156 2018-12-03 20:31:25 Shouldn't the "vile one" be kissing Trudeau's ass, since we get most of our oil from Canada?????

I wouldn't mind kissing Trudeau anywhere!
2157 2018-12-03 20:31:15 Albertans need the Federal government to butt out of their oil business until it has been completely botched. Then they want the Feds to come in and clean up their mess.
2158 2018-12-03 20:31:06 Centrism and charismatic are like water and oil: they do not and cannot mix. It’s basic common sense dammit!
2159 2018-12-03 20:31:03 This is when they have an oil leak and think adding oil keeps it new.
2160 2018-12-03 20:30:42 Ban Saudi Oil now!

Now remind me of the last climate change conference held in Nigeria, the theme of the conference and the outcome of the conference.

30k minimum wage is waiting, ASUU is waiting, oil workers are threatening, New Electoral bill, insecurity. He's in Poland!

2166 2018-12-03 20:30:25 Alberta and it’s oil carried Canada through our last recession and it’s likely a handcuffed resource sector with reduced revenues and investment will take Canada into the next one.
2167 2018-12-03 20:30:20 Yesterdays risk on excitement continued into the European and US session yesterday as stocks performed well particularly tech stocks and Oil rallied 7% after this weekends ‘truce’.

2169 2018-12-03 20:30:12 At first I ignored everyone about cbd oil with chronic pain and disorders that cause seizures but I can confirm that it's super helpful. Also legal in all states so that's even better
2170 2018-12-03 20:30:11 I use burts bees tea tree oil spot treatment (it’s like a rollerball) and also I like black African soap! They can be drying but if you use a good moisturizer it shouldn’t be too bad

2173 2018-12-03 20:30:02 I'm just going to put it out there. I don't care what the occasion is, if you come to that pulpit and on that altar the oil and tongues are going to flow. You thought were performing. You're at 1745 that oil is going to flow, rehersal,  the play, it doesn't matter.
2174 2018-12-03 20:30:02 I read something about that and was meaning to look it up. I saw they had CBD oil just for dogs and was wondering what the difference is between the too.
2175 2018-12-03 20:29:57 Love how these free marketers blame government for their incompetence. Harper baby sat these guys long enough. Oil prices are unpredictable because they can be manipulated for political purposes by the big players
2176 2018-12-03 20:29:52 I fought a LNG terminal in my town for years. It’s only purpose was to create artificial shortages in the Gas Market. The traders wanted NG on a world wide price like Oil so they could manipulate it.
2177 2018-12-03 20:29:44 Don't play with Moaath's syndrome or you are gonna be dead ..
2178 2018-12-03 20:29:42 Apprenticeship boat update #2! The loon kayak is moving along on schedule. Youth instructor Henry says that the next step will be to waterproof the wood using tung oil before they begin sewing up the ballistic nylon skin. What a beautiful boat!
2179 2018-12-03 20:29:38 How much oil was produced between 1701 and 1976?
2180 2018-12-03 20:29:37 fucking snake oil salesman praying on the vulnerable...absolute peice of shit.

What do Doctors call alternative medicine that works? Medicine.

2183 2018-12-03 20:29:25 To the contrary, Trump doesn't follow anything that doesn't personally impact him.  Now that he is in the position to maneuver how the US deals w/ environmental protection, the all mighty oil/gas industry $$$ dictates his actions & that of the EPA.
2184 2018-12-03 20:29:24 It’s quite evident that you have absolutely no idea what’s going on. What if I told you that big oil industry is funding alarmists. Why? In return they’ll get favors from the government while, at the same time, they know that humanity’s dependence on fossil fuels is a given.
2185 2018-12-03 20:29:17 I don't take Rev. Fr Mbaka serious anymore. He's gradually moving from shekinah glory to ichabod. 

Peter Obi should have visited Rev Fr. Obimma (Ebube mmụọ nsọ) instead.

There's no crude oil in adoration ground.
2186 2018-12-03 20:29:16 I made @mollyorangette's marmalade cake last night and it's worth making for its own sake. Plus it's full of citrus and olive oil and almonds so it's PRACTICALLY breakfast.
2187 2018-12-03 20:28:54 US markets are absolutely killing the #TSX, particularly the last few days. All big Canadian sectors are getting no respect: Great bank earnings shrugged off, nobody cares but mines, and oil stocks are not talked about in polite company. Today, interest sensitives getting whacked
2188 2018-12-03 20:28:52 That would be the same Ian wood who in 2014 lied about oil running out?

2193 2018-12-03 20:28:36 We can't all win there are three domestic trophies!
When you have to compete against oil  it nearly makes it impossible.
We do very well on the resources we have.
And as I said before yes I would love us to win but over time it has become more and more difficult.
2194 2018-12-03 20:28:28 We provide foam units, fishing services, and nitrogen units to customers in the oil and gas industry. Call us today.
2195 2018-12-03 20:28:14 Meanwhile tens of thousands of Oil workers recently without work before Christmas
2196 2018-12-03 20:28:08 Sadly while late in the morning you started coverage of the climate summit you continue to avoid confronting our politicians who basically deny climate change and support pipelines and oil production. The world is ending. You need to step up.
2197 2018-12-03 20:28:02 @SenGillibrand Drop Sen. Joe Manchin from Democratic leadership. New Yorkers are outside SenSchumer's office to demand he not allow Senator Manchin, a servant to the oil and gas industry, to lead the Energy and natural resources committee. Stand up for a #GreenNewDeal

2201 2018-12-03 20:27:36 You do know that America is the #1 producer of crude oil, right? I believe the word you are looking for to describe the ANWR is priceless, not worthless.

2206 2018-12-03 20:26:58 His pals in the british establishment must be paying him well just like in 2014 when all he did was tell lies about Scotlands oil.
2207 2018-12-03 20:26:52 A beautiful Hanukkah reflection from Rabbi Seth Goldstein:
"...perhaps the miracle of Hanukkah is not that a day’s worth of oil actually burned for eight days, but that the Hasmoneans recognized that they did not have enough, but decided to light it anyway. They knew ...
2208 2018-12-03 20:26:52 OH ,OH  turn the GAS / OIL of --- no car --- no warm house --- no food  --- no holiday trips  ( gas ) etc. Etc.  --- oh ,oh ya think --- not !
2209 2018-12-03 20:26:51 @Johnrush32 Before getting essential oils, CBD oil, relaxing treats, etc. he may do quite well with a radio or tv turned up to cover the sound. If not, try the thundershirt (for the vibration of the thunder) & music, and discuss best next steps with vet. Good luck. 
2210 2018-12-03 20:26:41 Although the US government knows that there may be dirty players in Iran's terrorist favor, there is no doubt that the first is Qatar, which may sell gas from the North Field, favor to Iran and also does not rule out, from selling oil favor to Iran.
2211 2018-12-03 20:26:34 So I have been seeing this board with vacancy at a newly renovated FORTE OIL gas station  around my area and my mind is telling me a lady out there might need it.

2213 2018-12-03 20:26:29 There are reasons oil cos don’t shut in when prices go low 
-significant costs to stop and start
-contract structure may not allow much variable cost savings
-The field could be damaged permanently 

The Alberta shut ins may work- but calculating net economics not simple

2214 2018-12-03 20:26:25 Good question. All travelers must comply with federal law on transporting marijuana and cannabis infused products, such as CBD oil, on board a flight. Our officers are required to notify law enforcement officers if they discover these products while screening your property.
2215 2018-12-03 20:26:16 Dirty uzbek oil money. Men sikkert flink til at købe spillere...
2216 2018-12-03 20:26:09 I'm sure we both know that if you drink TOO much kale smoothies, you're probably going to take a gnarly shit.

Are you claiming that Venezuela's hyperinflation is because of debt? Wouldn't it have more to do with their economy's sole reliance on oil exports?
2217 2018-12-03 20:26:08 It all started with that rassslin' reject turning himself into a living meme, goin' on about gay frogs and fluorine and challenging that gay ass Russian president to a topless oil rassslin match. The rest, my boy, is history.
2218 2018-12-03 20:26:07 He's a master manipulator who is able to read people & feed  their reactions with his malarkey. He's no different than any other  snake oil salesman. Some people eat it up ..NOT ME ..He's as phony as a three dollar bill.
2219 2018-12-03 20:26:07 Don't forget her new regulations of the industry. and her offer of $2b tax dollars for Kinder, her involvement in petrochemical industry, carbon cap deal with oil sands producers and wanting to purchase oil cars. This is about government control - socialism.
2220 2018-12-03 20:25:58 Whenever I go to the place I bought my car at, I get my oil changes for free but these niggas take more than an hour to do a 15 minute job. But when i go to the hood spots they charge me $35-40 and it’s quick, in and out lol
2221 2018-12-03 20:25:55 “CaN YOu cOoK?” Can you change my oil?!

2225 2018-12-03 20:25:33 Well the CBD oil has the THC removed so you feel no narcotic effect and I must say it's working for me. Getting the dosage right is a bit hit and miss but I'm getting there. So much better than I was a five weeks ago.
2226 2018-12-03 20:25:27 if u put olive oil in ur pasta water u are an absolute imbecile

2229 2018-12-03 20:25:20 Because of the oil obsession and failure to stop mining it. All the rest you do does not help when you continue to support one of the greatest green house gas industries in the world. That’s why.

2249 2018-12-03 20:22:51 Tom Brady reached the 1,000 yards rushing milestone. That averages to just over three yards a game. 

Tom Brady is so slow, at the Combine, they took his picture running the 40 with an oil painting.

NFL Films uses the "Ferris Bueller" song "Oh Yeah," to accompany his runs.
2250 2018-12-03 20:22:47 It doesn’t make any sense refining abroad. @Gidi_Traffic @NGRSenate These oil marketers may shutdown our country. We should never allow these nonsense. We must build a new mega refinery. The obsolete ones can be sold.
2251 2018-12-03 20:22:45 Sometimes gov tries to develop tech and industry scuttles it. At one point we were trying to develop hydrogen energy tech so we could get off fossil fuels and become energy independent. But the same corps that do H2 also do oil, so they used Navy tech for ultra-deepwater drilling
2252 2018-12-03 20:22:45 Most rigs are drilling for gas right now. There is liquids being stripped off the gas that are way more valuable then NG. No one is going to drill for oil at $15...

2255 2018-12-03 20:22:35 Dude. Calgary Flames inherited the name from the Atlanta Flames because the city was torched during the ACW. If the Flames are because of oil you better fucking run far and fast.
2256 2018-12-03 20:22:34 I just can’t see the oil companies making more profit producing less. Until the markets improves substantially. But I also fix cranes not economies.
2257 2018-12-03 20:22:17 Tomorrow’s class topic: Does it matter as much how people “feel” about climate change or how people can, with no remorse, dump oil down a sewer rather than riding a mile to the town dump? #Mindset #ClimateChange #notmyproblem #highereducation #NationalSecurity
2258 2018-12-03 20:22:11 Or you can get the hot oil going and get those toddlers frying up some sufganiyot

2265 2018-12-03 20:21:19 They mitigate the bedroom tax, prescriptions, and  university fees. Don't you want Scotland to look after it's own people? Westminster don't give a fcuk, they just want the oil.

2268 2018-12-03 20:21:13 Unless the Indians signed over the rights to the oil and gas produced from the land of this nation, then they should get a percentage of the profits as we still plunder what was theirs.  It is the least they deserve, our ancestors would have perished without their generosity.

2277 2018-12-03 20:20:30 Excellent news! The oil companies tried to do something similar in our Hudson River in New York but public outcry prevented it. I bet your fellow citizens in Black Isle pushed back as well.

4) Compare on chart where stock traded when oil was $25 higher than today that’s your target

Different parts of Nigeria "throw-spanners-into-the-works" at different times; while SW folks have some form of birth control, the NW, NC & NE have none. It makes it difficult to execute holistic changes

2287 2018-12-03 20:19:27 Changed my oil and got my tires rotated. Fresh tank of gas also. I’m happy.
2288 2018-12-03 20:19:20 Rona Ambrose on BNN churning out so many talking-points that it's a wonder she didn't collapse for lack of breath. The main message: we should emulate unregulated regimes because Canadian oil companies are having trouble competing. #cdnpoli
2289 2018-12-03 20:19:10 You coloreds better make sure y'all ladies gettin oil changes or she can't come pick yo bum ass up

2294 2018-12-03 20:18:48 Splash your aubergines in vinegar as well as oil before you roast them. Just a little tip there. Evergreen. Wee oil & vinegar dressing on the aubs and 40 mins at 200.
2295 2018-12-03 20:18:41 The cost being prohibitive while oil prices are lower they’ll explore, drill, and then cap. There’s plenty of capped but tapped oil in gulf to leave this area unexplored.

2300 2018-12-03 20:18:16 There's a lot of junk information out there about perimenopause. Thanks for the link. I see it mentions lifestyle options, HRT and antidepressants. Would love unbiased research on CBC/THC oil (to feel normal, not get high). Any ideas?
2301 2018-12-03 20:18:16 Our natural world needs protecting from industries trying to spoil our earth. Any and all oil drilled the the region belongs to the people living on the Arctic continent. Oil companies should be made to pay huge tariffs on each barrel of oil pumped, pricing oil companies out!!

2308 2018-12-03 20:17:26 And so versatile! East Cape manuka oil serves as a natural #insectrepellent, heals scarring, is 20-30 times more antibacterial than tea tree oil, kills MRSA and so much more! Yet it is still soft on the skin and safe to apply to sensitive areas :)

2318 2018-12-03 20:16:42 I likened the malibu Oil scam to  7books of moses, not anybody can open that book, whoever that dare open d book will bear d consequence.
2319 2018-12-03 20:16:35 Happy Hanukkah to our Jewish friends. The miracle of one day of lamp oil lasting 8 days is considered a minor miracle in Judaism. Who says G-d has no pressure on him?
2320 2018-12-03 20:16:32 Did You Know? #US has no reason whatsoever to import oil from other countries. America land possesses enough oil to never need import it.
2321 2018-12-03 20:16:29 I’m tired 
2322 2018-12-03 20:16:27 Before she joined she would proabbly want to know; how many of those 100 millon barrels of oil that we use daily are being used by the @UN? What is your plan for halving that ammount by 2020? and reducing it to 0 by 2030? That is what is needed. Step up adults, stop recruiting.

2326 2018-12-03 20:16:07 Seems like an odd marriage.
2327 2018-12-03 20:15:53 They need to all be dunked into a big vat of Oil of Ulay! ...and left there to regenerate!
2328 2018-12-03 20:15:52 Wouldn’t cutting production mean oil companies would be spending less on construction also less maintenance. So more cuts to jobs could come?
2329 2018-12-03 20:15:50 "Adding salt, oil, and chilli to things and roasting them makes you want to eat a lot of them" isn't exactly a cunning devious generation strategy.

2332 2018-12-03 20:15:48 In reality an aquifer and an oil/gas reservoir shouldn’t be able to mix - oil sits on water and gas on both oil and water. 
We were working below 10,000’ and 100miles out.
2333 2018-12-03 20:15:45 Election 2019 - household debt/incr int rates, economy will be in serious trouble, oil prod cuts will still be in place, no p/l started, GDP will be neg, huge $$ deficit, immigration will still be a major issue, investments down - maybe there is hope for the Tories!!!!

2335 2018-12-03 20:15:41 FFS I ran out of oil. Should have bought a new bottle. Am attempting olive oil and hoping it doesn’t change the flavor too much.
2336 2018-12-03 20:15:40 Nothing wrong with electric cars if it means less reliance on "blood" oil? Break the genie's hold on the ME!
2337 2018-12-03 20:15:40 Talk about not seeing the forest for the trees.. Anything to avoid discussing the failure of socialism.. Oil isn't destroying the world.. Liberalism is...
2338 2018-12-03 20:15:37 We are still talking about Oil Exploration right?

2340 2018-12-03 20:15:20 Trudeau sure as hell gives more support to the ISIS terrorists than Canada's hard working Oil Patch Workers.
2341 2018-12-03 20:15:18 Oops, was supposed to go here.

Divinity degree dropout’s oil industry plans are as helpful as ice cubes in hell. Now if we were referring to controlling women’s reproduction choices, or condemning LGBQT children for just being themselves, he’d have plenty of ice cubes to offer.
2342 2018-12-03 20:15:17 Civility of politics was true when it was just rich white men in politics but as soon as ppl of color, women, LBGTQ got involved civility was gone-thx @lizzwinstead  Horton ad, very generous of spirit. Bush called Al Gore Ozone Man because oil has to be protected at all costs.
2343 2018-12-03 20:15:03 hi proof cooking oil....
2344 2018-12-03 20:14:37 Meanwhile, JT is also being vilified by folks in the oil industry.
2345 2018-12-03 20:14:31 Nope, Alberta is cutting their oil production next month
2346 2018-12-03 20:14:30 That oil patch speed dawg
2347 2018-12-03 20:14:13 Always wear gloves when handling any chemicals as cleaners are designed to remove oil and grease as well as the natural oils in your skin.
2348 2018-12-03 20:14:13 The ridiculousness of this is the World doesn’t need the oil. Science has proven other sources of energy are viable to power our planet cleaner, cheaper, and environmentally safer. Big Petroleum will fight  to hold on to obsolete technology and deny us a brighter future. #science
2349 2018-12-03 20:14:09 I got an oil stain out of my pants. Im your mom now. Hmu for mom things 
2350 2018-12-03 20:14:08 Oil it up
2351 2018-12-03 20:14:08 GM shutting down ops (at least temporarily) on both sides of the US/CAN border, gas/oil is at a pleasant yet alarming low. Ontario seems to be cutting a ton in many different places including education. I'm no expert but it seems to be like prepping for a storm.
2352 2018-12-03 20:14:06 7000 rail cars @ a cost of $100 000 each = $700 million taxpayer subsidy to big oil.

Govt continues to shovel our $$ into an industry that isn't profitable, is dying and is contributing to #climateChange.    #cdnpoli #ableg
2353 2018-12-03 20:14:02 Yes you are but your husband:lied on ACA, Benghazi, Syria, Collusion with Russia, and many more. He just did not know how to do anything. He took credit on oil production despite his policy against it.

2357 2018-12-03 20:13:42 i’m not sure about organic extra virgin olive oil for me. I do not think I have any ancestry from the middle east or southern europe so not sure if i have the right set of genome to handle all phyto-sterols.

2359 2018-12-03 20:13:38 Wow I just read s very interesting article in Times about Hannakah.  It’s the hard core Maccabees against the liberal Hellenistic.  And this oil thing is silly and has no meaning
2360 2018-12-03 20:13:22 My dad use to always get my oil changes idk when I’m suppose to get them

2363 2018-12-03 20:13:18 Brexit or Europe are not in the debate here. Just the taxes on oil and a scornful government, no more
2364 2018-12-03 20:13:14 @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi using this as excuse to postpone meetings with WH.
I doubt 41 would approve. IMO he would want the business of gov to continue forward.
They should be able to honor him and do their jobs at same time.
2365 2018-12-03 20:13:05 After wine at MILs bday dinner I blurted out 41 killed Kennedy...right after my Standard Oil pensioned FIL discussed his admiration for the man.  Did I just say that out loud at dinner? Oops.

2371 2018-12-03 20:12:31  Oil Prices are climbing again as shown on today's Stock Market prices. OPEC has their meeting next week, and is sure to cut oil production forcing prices to rise. 10 Days ago, I warned folks to fill their home heating tanks. I did. You can., too, within the next week.
2372 2018-12-03 20:12:27 ANWR was suppose to be a strategic reserve. Russia has vast oil resources compared to the US. He that can move it's military last wins. What good does it do to pump so much oil that crude drops to 40 bucks a barrel but the price at the pump did not drop half as much...
2373 2018-12-03 20:12:17 My car was just 14,000 miles over due on an oil change. Nbd 
2374 2018-12-03 20:12:14 First of all, you should explain Mr. Trump what means "good envirnomental practices"...if he shows a true understanding about the issue so you will have a real oportunity to ask him to stop the the oil drilling improve...
2375 2018-12-03 20:12:14 Really the same guy that said oil was running out just before a massive find off Shetland b4 referendum #talksbollocks
2376 2018-12-03 20:12:08 1/? with the death of #Bush41 i was reviewing the 1988 campaign, reading about Lee Atwater... whose younger brother Joe died at age 3 in a horrific kitchen accident of the hot oil in a deep fryer spilling down all over on the child as the mother was making donuts for the boys.
2377 2018-12-03 20:12:08 What like no option but tirade against a country for oil purposes total scum that bloke

2383 2018-12-03 20:11:39 @RepLaMalfa @SenFeinstein @SenKamalaHarris: Tell @realDonaldTrump @SecretaryZinke not to risk >1.5 million jobs and ~$108 billion in GDP in the Atlantic for <7 months’ worth of oil and <6 months’ worth of gas. #BlockTheBlast #ProtectOurCoast
2384 2018-12-03 20:11:23 "We need to get our oil to tidewater so Alberta should separate" makes me wish I had a button to make my head explode. Every. Damned. Time.
2385 2018-12-03 20:11:12 Sorry I meant 2001, in terms of frauds (we have some 'Next enron' candidates)
Overall I believe it's going to be worse than 2008, because the 'FED put' is not so valuable anymore and problems will come from tech and oil, and are inevitable because of the industrial revolution.

2391 2018-12-03 20:10:56 It has nothing to do with your government .... Crude oil prices crashed internationally .... dont think we indians are fool !!!
2392 2018-12-03 20:10:53 Big oil can go frac themselves! CANADA is cutting back production because of a glut but Trump wants to fuel the economy by burning every reserve we have. Small price to pay to get himself re elected I guess!
2393 2018-12-03 20:10:52 And also was his idea and on his watch to watch 300 AMerican troops DIE in the first Desert Storm -- which was nothing but a War for Oil.  Stop glamorizing war presidents people.  Unbelievable.  Oh - and 500 came home disfigured and injured forever.  For --- OIL.
2394 2018-12-03 20:10:51 Ohhh you mean the highly liberal third party canidate that ran as a anti-establishment canidate that opposed all of your views. 

You are a tool... The swamp gained 60 to 70 feet since you put big oil and big banks into the presidential cabinet.
2395 2018-12-03 20:10:44 May u stay longer to build this nation.Sir for the fast 3/1 years u came to the office, we know how u find this country but, as a capable leader we all believe u can solve the problem of common man.

2405 2018-12-03 20:09:43 @SenSchumer Drop Sen. Joe Manchin from Democratic leadership. New Yorkers are outside your office to demand you not allow Senator Manchin- a servant to the oil and gas industry- to lead the Energy and natural resources committee! Stand up for a #GreenNewDeal
2406 2018-12-03 20:09:38 Or it considers olive oil a regulated good?
2407 2018-12-03 20:09:38 What happened with the petrol prices today #NRMA. How can they go up 35 cpl in one hit. The AUS dollar is up. The world oil price is low. Let’s get Peter Khoury fro the nrma on the tele to explain. Again. #ACCC
2408 2018-12-03 20:09:33 If the love of the country and the interests of Nigerians are important to our leaders is the proven oil reserves not enough to do something tangible. The old Western region did not have that much ,yet made impact with many developmental achievements.
2409 2018-12-03 20:09:29 Oil

2412 2018-12-03 20:09:24 if Kuwait didn't have oil, they would be part of Iraq today!
They didn't liberate Kuwait for democracy but for big oil and $$$, because they make big $$ out of Kuwait.  Bush senior was far from being an angel and now he is far from being a saint!
2413 2018-12-03 20:09:14 Wow. She associates the mid east financials w their religion. THE MID EAST ARE OBSCENELY WEALTHY BC OF THEIR OIL! Following sharia didnt make it so. SCIENCE DID.
2414 2018-12-03 20:09:14 As expected PPI lower on the ground of stronger lira and declining oil prices but base effect is to be unfriendly until Q2 19 plus overall trend stubbornly refuses to go lower.
2415 2018-12-03 20:09:08 Don't presume I like Oil City Ma'am I've never liked them and those fans who send writers fruit baskets for murdering off Laurel. Sorry I'll never like like this show when it could have been something truly great but you guys pander to a sect of fans who harass people.
2416 2018-12-03 20:08:52 They aren’t. They add value locally (sweeten the oil), don’t have much oil sands, and oil isn’t as large a part of their economy. So why should they if they are still making money? Kenney is just looking for cover for fed CPC screw up in AB.
2417 2018-12-03 20:08:47 I’m a lash tech! If you can’t go get them removed, use an oil (coconut, olive, etc) and take your time . Don’t pull on the lashes !

2420 2018-12-03 20:08:23 Good point. Mind you I'm a fucker for staining new clothes permanently, bleach, oil, grease, cooking oil, does my head in, waste of money
2421 2018-12-03 20:08:20 I don't think I'm being particularly radical here. Yes, security of supply and market integration should be achieved - but in a way that avoids unnecessary lock-in to carbon emissions or stranded asset risk. On current evidence, I'm not the gas and oil priority corridors do that.
2422 2018-12-03 20:08:19 someone buy me a weighted blanket and some cbd oil for christmas! thanks in advance!
2423 2018-12-03 20:08:14 Oil workers getting canned right with xmas around the corner....and this fuckin guy is givin away $50m like its change in his pocket.
2424 2018-12-03 20:08:14 NDP is asking about govt. plan not to cut oil production.  Premier Moe back from India up to answer. Says he understands why Alberta cut production. He says talked to industry “do not feel it will be effective.” Mentions no oil sands here another reason.
2425 2018-12-03 20:08:14 استوعبت الموقف دلوقتي
كنتي بتسأليني هو coton oil هو ال castor وقولتلك اه برضو ومش عارفه ايه الغباء ده
2426 2018-12-03 20:08:08 Omg I just seen someone post about oil paints at michaels being super cheap like they’re usually over $100 but they’re @ michaels for $64 plus michaels has 40% as well! I think the brand is like 1980?
2427 2018-12-03 20:08:00 Now you're talking. Don't buy the snake oil.
2428 2018-12-03 20:07:48 Drilling for oil in a wildlife refuge is probably the worst thing you could do for wildlife in that refuge
2429 2018-12-03 20:07:46 it feels good not only my Oil Less Fryer came in the mail today where I can eat junk foods but in a healthier way but having a day off too I'm like I'm definitely ready for this week especially Friday!!! 
2430 2018-12-03 20:07:44 I’m sure with some garlic, peppers, a bit of olive oil they taste great. The Inuits themselves may have their own recipes
2431 2018-12-03 20:07:36 The Rabbit in the Woods. Oil.
2432 2018-12-03 20:07:21 So far today I’ve gotten press releases for shows about medical errors, rape, oil drilling and child abuse, and one release that spoiled a show I was saving to watch tonight. DARK DAY IN YE OLDE INBOXXE.
2433 2018-12-03 20:07:17 Finding the motivation to sweat out all of the carbs and oil is the real miracle of #Hanukkah
2434 2018-12-03 20:07:13 Don't get my hopes up there Ned! 

I think this is one of those 'feeler' articles where EU wants to gauge US pushback on it. Already EU probably emboldened more than ever before with China starting Shanghai Oil Futures in March. Definitely everyone should be watching this closely
2435 2018-12-03 20:07:11 Beto was 1st for oil and gas contributions and 2nd for hedge funds. He voted to fast track the TPP. He is no progressive.
2436 2018-12-03 20:07:04 Keep oil prices below $55 and the Russian economy will quickly collapse. Only true export they make $ from.
2437 2018-12-03 20:06:58 Question Period is a go for the final week of session. @ryanmeili starting off on @PremierScottMoe says he will not be cutting oil production like in Alberta. Did Moe talk to Notley and what is Moe's plan in the short term #skpoli
2438 2018-12-03 20:06:52 My Volvo has 165k miles on the clock and better not get any fancy ideas about going to  Volvo for a service. It’ll be lucky if it gets some oil and it better be grateful!
2439 2018-12-03 20:06:48 #SKQP is out of the gates! @ryanmeili The premier announced his gov't won’t be mandating oil production cuts. Has the premier examined the impacts his decision could have for SK? If not through cuts, how will the gov't work to address this differential? #skpoli
2440 2018-12-03 20:06:42 Had that small logistical issue if we went to Baghdad.  The Saudis provided us with free gas and water. Not sure what we would have done if they cut us off while on the rod to Baghdad.  Seize the oil fields, pipelines and water production of SA.  This would not have gone well.
2441 2018-12-03 20:06:42 @avrotrosradar had @Consumentenbond oil een collectief verzekering?
2442 2018-12-03 20:06:34 Are you in the UK?
I was involved in fracking offshore in the 80’s, certainly helps production. I hear tales of ground water contamination, that’s most likely from the casing cement or drilling mud. If it was from the oil reservoir there would have been oil in the water
2443 2018-12-03 20:06:29 You might want to consider trying cbd oil for dogs, it's really effective for seizures
2444 2018-12-03 20:06:25 I was aware of the deal. But, again, I thought at the time that some exposure to our Western ways would help acclimate Saudis into thinking that we smelly Americans have merit beyond being consumers of their oil.

Alas, how my dreams were crushed like Brutus Beefcake's facr.
2445 2018-12-03 20:06:10 Has one dresser drawer just for dark-gray V-neck sweaters. Loves gardening. Tracks his car oil changes on a notebook he stores in the glove compartment.
2446 2018-12-03 20:06:10 I bet JK does, since the fact Saskatchewan has a more diversified oil production (i.e. adding value to product in Saskatchewan) will eventually lead to the discovery that Harper & Cabinet (Kenney incl) screwed up big time by not investing in local diversification projects in AB.

2453 2018-12-03 20:05:29 Quite true re Iran. "Oppose communism" was quite a stretch, though. Mossadegh was part of the 3rd world mainstream. It was the OIL that did it.

2456 2018-12-03 20:05:10 Exactly, because Jane and Old Snake Oil Salesman Sanders parlayed those $27. 95 dollar donations into two brand new homes. And one is even a Lakeside Property.
2457 2018-12-03 20:05:09 we have enough problems with the Clark/Superman glasses thing. Unless they oil their mustache uniquely in one of their personas this will be the same problem.  or same fun.

2459 2018-12-03 20:05:03 KSA drained their storage down to 20 days from 30 days. They gave it to USA to increase our storage to please Trump and knock down oil prices here. KSA is now exporting less now that our mid-term elections are over. Pure manipulation.
2460 2018-12-03 20:04:50 The price of oil, if you think about it, is the same. Refining to gasoline probably costs the same. So, the $9 gasoline has $6 worth of tax
2461 2018-12-03 20:04:49 Man i think not getting oil changes fucked me car uppppp

2463 2018-12-03 20:04:42 It’s not your oil at all. Greedy nationalist. And it’s not my fault you can’t read.
2464 2018-12-03 20:04:42 Right. You can also plant rosemary, catnip, peppermint and basil for mosquitoes, use rosemary oil or dry out rosemary and others and put outside in a poupourri dish. They don't like the smell at all. So many natural repellants out there, but the pesticide companies want their $.

2472 2018-12-03 20:03:49 As one who lived through it, it started when Kuwait was attacked by Iraq. Some justification for it, especially as it was contained to getting Iraq out of Kuwait.  Was oil part of the equation? Probably!

2489 2018-12-03 20:02:51 You are closer to this than me.  But my recollection is that the tanker ban was a result of the uproar in BC about using Kittimat for the oil terminal.  Their reluctance to respond to public concerns was similar to XL and the Sandhills.  Neither company was 100% innocent of fault
2490 2018-12-03 20:02:42 KSA needs $87 brent to balance their budget. It's not a war where they should be producing oil at a low price and punish their citizens. At $60k brent their "welfare" programs for the country cause them to take a loss against reserves.

2505 2018-12-03 20:01:15 Nope, no finite resource issues. it’s a distribution issue (hoarding by the wealthiest) & energy use issue (we have solar & other renewable sources of energy). It’s the charlatanism encouraged by capitalism that has led us to climate denials for presentation of oil industry

This "glut" comes from fracking technology which provides a relatively higher output over a much shorter period of time, compared to traditional fields.

2539 2018-12-03 19:58:25 When the price of fuel drops below $1/L Rachel springs in to action to correct this by regulating oil production to facilitate a rise in fuel prices because why put in a carbon tax nobody wanted and not get to use it.
2540 2018-12-03 19:58:15 It's expected that by Feb mar crude oil may hit 35-40$ I wonder what will happen to libbies
2541 2018-12-03 19:58:14 It's the only logical answer. Canadian oil/tar sands are only viable above a certain price. That price is not in the near future. Politicians should have long been preparing for this day, but she is now being caught flat-footed.
2542 2018-12-03 19:58:10 Yes I understand, but Peter was already fired from Boardwalks and walks was attacking Two Gun and federal was importing Sand oil from Sudan all these years to Canada Term-mac in what idle TransCanada
2543 2018-12-03 19:58:03 That’s why you use scented oils, perfume is alcohol based and sits on top of your skin and comes off when you sweat or get hot. Oils are made to sit on top and sink into you skin so when you sweat or your body gets hot you smell like whatever scented oil you put on.
2544 2018-12-03 19:58:03 HAPPY HANUKKAH HOES  get ready for 8 nights of sucking DICK!  The Jews escaped the desert on 8 nights of oil  but you'll do it on 8 nights of CUM ! Shove a DREIDEL up your butt GOBBLE UP a LATKE dick! Send this to 8 of your Hanukkah THOTTIESfor a l
2545 2018-12-03 19:57:54 Who else wanted to raise taxes on oil/fuel? Beto did... This could have been Texas
2546 2018-12-03 19:57:31 The heaviness of the oil craves the brightness of the applesauce. Now, a potato blintz .... sour cream, all the way.
2547 2018-12-03 19:57:29 Keep your shitty oil pipelines and tunnels out of our Great Lakes!

2549 2018-12-03 19:57:13 ISIS wishes. By a backwards oil cartel with national sovereignty.
2550 2018-12-03 19:57:01 Oil all the way 
2551 2018-12-03 19:56:54 Seems it is just supply and demand being leveled by a gov't that won't allow certain producers - those that ship raw product - go bankrupt. 

I wonder what @suncor @HuskyEnergy  and Imperial Oil think? They had their competition on the run...
2552 2018-12-03 19:56:48 Agreement with Iran maybe? 

There’s something behind this - in while Qatar “produces” more oil than ever, more Oil than they have 
2553 2018-12-03 19:56:38 Agreed. Shows it's easy to make assumptions - group work, project-based learning, inquiry, even 'constructivism' can be tools in the box provided learning is teacher-led overall and follows clear instructional principles. He's very clear about '21st C snake oil though'!
2554 2018-12-03 19:56:26 I was at a oil change place and this show was on their TV in the lobby. I had to ask the other persons sitting in the lobby if I could change the channel? ALL SAID PLEASE DO SO!  This programming is a LIBERAL, BRAIN-DEAD programming for this 20-something and left-wing morons! #
2555 2018-12-03 19:56:17 The federal government never made a distinction between basic provincial revenue and auto sector, fishing, or mining revenue, like they did with oil and gas revenue to justify additional taxation on one province to distribute to others.

2556 2018-12-03 19:56:16 bled oil from veins
2557 2018-12-03 19:56:11 or could it be from their abundance of oil
2558 2018-12-03 19:56:11 The VP gave credence to what existed as speculation within grapevine, with a veiled reference to some spiritual leaders as meddlesome in state affairs, especially as it pertains to pursuing parochial interests at the expense of d nation. Banking & Oil money topped these issues.

2560 2018-12-03 19:56:04 Sounds like decent support to the oil industry to keep things moving on that supposedly needed project (though oil moved just fine before it, right?)
2561 2018-12-03 19:55:54 damn homeless people dumping their motor oil and lawn fertilizer down the gutter
2562 2018-12-03 19:55:51 The cut is likely going to be bigger than 1.2M and Russia will cut immediately. They said they would respond quickly, not drag their feet like everyone is suggesting. Oil is up over 4% cause the market agrees with me.
2563 2018-12-03 19:55:51 Lipstick is like a street drug, but without all the nasty side effects. If it gets banned - I'll break bad and make you some in my home lab. All I'll need is crayons and some coconut oil. Melt together, refrigerate...voila!
2564 2018-12-03 19:55:38 I always think the oil change people tryna finesse me to get me to buy extra shit but whole time i probably be needing what they suggesting...they tryna get over too though
2565 2018-12-03 19:55:28 The amount of money they collect from ma3s is enough motivation for them to frustrate this development. Remember how they frustrate the traffic lights? They are hell bent on remaining on the roads to oil their pockets.
2566 2018-12-03 19:55:24 A lot of the oil jobs - very well paid ones - are not coming back. The industry is in structural change.
2567 2018-12-03 19:55:23 Donny claims that he doesn’t drink or use drugs, except some snake oil that claims to grow hair on an egg. So, why does he appear to be perpetually drunk? You might say his brain takes a time out, but it never seems to be working.
2568 2018-12-03 19:55:09 In 90's Barbera Walters did 60 min expose I believe, highlighted fed prison programs portrayed as benefitting prisoners while reg people couldn't send kids to college. 
Resulted in phasing out of job training, Pell grants ect. Wasn't all about tennis courts
2569 2018-12-03 19:55:07 sii, asi es ..    y mas % de suba del indice    ni las petroleras x el oil  ..  hasta esperaba por los menos un 2% de suba  promedio de paridades y  eso q tasa es de 2.99  
ni brasil ..
2570 2018-12-03 19:55:06 Fam oil prices dropped.

Even though I wasn't looking forward to that, I was worried about the cause. I was thinking it's possibly a result of the row between Qatar and Saudi but they claim they are concentrating on their gas production, which is better business for them
2571 2018-12-03 19:55:01 There is only one super supervisor for this whole thing ( Mr. K. Faleh ), balancing inventories is out of control and require long time bcz Ginger uses Iran oil waivers as his buffer zone. Something different and dramatic must taken.
2572 2018-12-03 19:54:55 The claim that "illustrations" depicting genitals and sex is not permitted. However they still allow nudity in form of sculptures and "illustrations".
So it's pretty much gonna be if you make 1500s oil paintings it's OK, but you can't draw things that's supposed to be sexy.
2573 2018-12-03 19:54:42 Q: to CBC Alberta At Noon: What is the magnitude of the benefit to the consumers in Alberta of the lower priced oil? How does this compare with the magnitude of the transfer to the producers of the higher prices? (i.e., tradeoffs between consumer surplus and producer surplus?)
2574 2018-12-03 19:54:27 Lol I was even given a number to call if I wanted more, it was a surprising gesture.
2575 2018-12-03 19:54:23 Because someway, somehow The Donald is making money off of this. Somewhere there are oil stocks, somewhere he owns land there. Somewhere.
2576 2018-12-03 19:54:18 Extra Virgin Olive Oil #EVOO quality (both chemical and sensorial) is one of the main objectives in our breeding program. For evaluation, we need to extract the oil from fruits following a process that simulates at laboratory scale the industrial process of #EVOO production.
2577 2018-12-03 19:54:15 Well I have suuuper dry skin so I use a hydrating essence first, then I mix oil (currently maracuja tarte oil) into a lightweight moisturizer! Currently purity from philosophy :)
2578 2018-12-03 19:54:12 $GBR $DNR $CEI like them all here on oil right now.
2579 2018-12-03 19:54:11 Your comments are that of a typical Lpool fan mate living in the past, which I admit was a great past but don’t kid yourself with the oil money comment as all teams gain supporters when a team does well, we were well supported in division 2 pal
2580 2018-12-03 19:54:10 There is nothing except exploration. Even Invictus had to correct the Herald's fiction that oil had been discovered in Muzarabani. But let me not spoil your mental asylum games...
2581 2018-12-03 19:53:53 Lo hubieran anunciado en Argentum así usaban las lagrimas de Mauricio!! Hoy
Bajan la nafta 1.5% despues que en el año subio un 65%? Y el gas-oil lo suben un 3%. Con el gas oil se mueven todas las Materias Primas y las mercaderias y la inflación? @mauriciomacri
@JavierIgualacel
2582 2018-12-03 19:53:50 We love reading this! Thank you for giving us a try. We’re so glad our Squalane Oil has been so helpful! 
2583 2018-12-03 19:53:44 Other than of course c-69, reworking NEB rules, cancelling pipelines, declaring he will phase out oil sands, not appealing court rulings, allowing protestors to block approved pipelines, carbon taxes on oil while exempting other industry.He’s been oil patch workers best friend.
2584 2018-12-03 19:53:37 My beard oil makes my beard smell like lemon meringue and yeah it's lovely
2585 2018-12-03 19:53:37 And we have not reached peak #Oil yet that won't be until 2035 -2040s #COP24 So much more oil to be used and massive profit to be made
2586 2018-12-03 19:53:30 You mean time world oil prices plummeted. Coincidence? I think not.
2587 2018-12-03 19:53:27 I'm thankful for the grace upon my life. The oil upon my head, the Father i've got by my side. In all, I Love you jesus.
2588 2018-12-03 19:53:25 What a wild couple weeks. Up over $20k thanks to you @KobeissiLetter. Holding onto my $GDX now
2589 2018-12-03 19:53:18 The oil companies.. and their government cronies, that is.
2590 2018-12-03 19:53:18 Nearly all recent US oil output growth has been private not public land ie TX ND. Exceptions: CO, NM, UT.  Reforms to cut subsidies, force cleanup etc are valuable in own right. Arguments for supply cuts per se reflect idealized misunderstanding of how oil markets actually work
2591 2018-12-03 19:53:18 I will need to see a supportive document to your statement!  Perhaps you might be using the kings name to cover ya track. And if found guilty, that will lead to a serious conviction 
2592 2018-12-03 19:53:18 I agree that diesel needs to be killed off ASAP petrol however isn’t so bad emissions wise.
The technology either isn’t here yet or the oil companies have silenced it
2593 2018-12-03 19:53:00 Coisas boas alguém conhece o “World best oil free moisture lotion” da origins?
2594 2018-12-03 19:52:45 istg Walmart takes forever to change some damn oil
2595 2018-12-03 19:52:44 Aye man - you gotta stay pretty out here in these streets. Can’t get caught slipping. So if that means some of that coconut oil spritz every other morning....
2596 2018-12-03 19:52:40 That’s misleading. That’s the # of people from oil & gas fields who donated to Beto during his campaign. He took $0 from PAC’s (I looked this up after seeing it to confirm).
2597 2018-12-03 19:52:39 oh god I keep getting hit with these like. waves of nausea and it’s so crappy but I’m drinking more castor oil soon so I can’t wait to throw up haha haha haha!
2598 2018-12-03 19:52:27 First thought. Snake oil salesmen. Then, I read testimonials. Then, I read criticisms. A commercial has only ever influenced me to change the channel.
2599 2018-12-03 19:52:19 Lite, sweet, crude oil $ounds like a drink to me.

2602 2018-12-03 19:52:17 #WesternrailCar August statistics Canada's grain export terminals can handle 19,000 cars a week, but the rails say they'll deliver 8,000 a week combined in winter and 11,000 the rest of the year. Now Alberta wants to add 7000 Oil Cars wonder how that may affect movement overall?
2603 2018-12-03 19:52:13 my dad wants me to go get my oil changed and tires rotated on my car?? AND pay for it.. I don’t wanna be an adult
2604 2018-12-03 19:52:10 Im on it! Looking for more oil plays.
2605 2018-12-03 19:51:56 So big pharma, big oil, legacy pick and for profit prisons. 

Interesting interests you got there.
2606 2018-12-03 19:51:56 A little truffle oil hits the spot
2607 2018-12-03 19:51:53 Oil is at $50 a barrel. They pay $8 a gallon already.
2608 2018-12-03 19:51:45 Yeses hot oil burnt me so badly in 2012 while I was trying to make hot wings. A few years later, the scars are still visible on my chest. I’m grateful that the ones on my face were artificial and eventually faded 
2609 2018-12-03 19:51:43 If only you could@get one day of oil to last all week.
2610 2018-12-03 19:51:38 Olive oil
2611 2018-12-03 19:51:36 Transport restriction is artificial, and caused by the Trudeau government and lack of pipelines.  We in Alberta are more than happy to let the market decide prices, as long as the gov't allows market access for all the oil we can produce.
2612 2018-12-03 19:51:33 I’m bout to be an adult and get an oil change instead of blow my money 
2613 2018-12-03 19:51:26 Do we not already have war with and China and the Mid East news and recently watched recent [so called presidential (not) communications at the G20] ... news is propaganda for war mongering resource extractors. #minerals #oil #gas #diamonds #falseeconomy #throwawayproducts
2614 2018-12-03 19:51:09 First, this is at federal level where good time is practically nonexistent to start with. Relatively speaking, the numbers of people affected are low compared to states.
With exclusions for violent crimes, illegal aliens, could work. Better than doing nothing
2615 2018-12-03 19:50:58 Fkk you are stupid. We met and meet all the criteria for rejoining eu. We are members. Eu would have fastraked us because we are part of the family, not to mention the fishing, oil, etc
2616 2018-12-03 19:50:55 Cars? Yeah, I have one, but I live in a city where it's impossible to live without one. We live in a world that the oil and auto companies shaped to their liking. Their pro-fossil fuel ads, propaganda, & political contributions overwhelmed the opposition, and still do.
2617 2018-12-03 19:50:55 Oil has been in charge of Washington for a long, long time.
2618 2018-12-03 19:50:45 $CANN.c $HERTF Could @HeritageCannab become the new major player in the industry that the street didn't see coming from behind the scene ?! With 2 LP's and 1 oil license, deal with $WEED, deal with $TRST, Cheech branding, 1600 acres of hemp with PurFarma and a 3.2M sqft option
2619 2018-12-03 19:50:42 Id be happy to help check the oil and water 
2620 2018-12-03 19:50:35 As long as you dont skip out on the baby oil we good.
2621 2018-12-03 19:50:35 That should say "host country's name". My bad. It's entirely possible that RT is nefarious. I would put them at the bottom of the list of TV networks that concern me given the NDAA and our media's reliance on money from weapons manufacturers and oil, gas, and pharma.
2622 2018-12-03 19:50:34 Put on some tea tree oil! It'll do wonders!
2623 2018-12-03 19:50:30 Wood is a  corrupt Yoon courtesan who’s oil greed has caused #ClimateChange but he’s ok while you are struggling
2624 2018-12-03 19:50:25 Why is gas getting more expensive as I approach Louisiana I thought that was like our whole thing is we can let oil companies fuck us in every way bc gas prices
2625 2018-12-03 19:50:23 I change my own oil because most people want to charge too much.
2626 2018-12-03 19:50:14 Well, that was a surprise ending for me, but yeah, it's always about the oil lately.
2627 2018-12-03 19:50:06 Words of warning! Opened the bathroom window and knocked the small glass jar that had coconut oil in off the window ledge. Don't keep glass in the bathroom, people! Only time I've ever been pleased ours is small. #allthetinyshards #childrenandanimals #makeupremover
2628 2018-12-03 19:50:02 That and fish oil... Every morning it fucking sucks ass...
2629 2018-12-03 19:49:59 People with oil wells aren't even reading about it. Congrats on TFAA nomination. Deserved.
2630 2018-12-03 19:49:57 so it makes you wonder who is in charge? Why would Alberta sell their oil at half the going price? Alberta loses and the Texas oil companies get richer. Stopping production is an obvious solution.
2631 2018-12-03 19:49:56 #fillyourstockings #enchantedbynature the oil of life facial oil is incredible 
2632 2018-12-03 19:49:44 Lots of oil and gas stocks selling below net asset value or below reserves amount. I made a ton of money back in 2002-2003 buying small cap Oil- Gas stocks selling at a discount to their reserves bc you get a free ride up when Oil goes back up in price, which it always does.
2633 2018-12-03 19:49:26 

OK!
2634 2018-12-03 19:49:24 Cmon oil it’s time to go back down

2640 2018-12-03 19:48:45 If the world is going to end in 10 years WHY are we planning for the next 30 yrs. oh right. Snake oil salesman Gore got it wrong last time and all the previous global warming scares were wrong too. Was thinking of WHOOPEE but guess I better do planning.
2641 2018-12-03 19:48:44 The #CorruptGOP knows perfectly well bans work. They don't tax abortions gay marriage: they ban em! KNOW tax ineffective. 
A #CarbonTax won't end oil age: BANS will! 
We banned lightbulbs, got CFLs +LEDs We banned ozone depleting chems: closed the ozone hole.
2642 2018-12-03 19:48:41 Zionists blame Turkey for trading in ISIS oil (not true) while ignoring Assad guilt.

Wonder why Bibi keeps mum about Assad standing up ISIS.
2643 2018-12-03 19:48:41 They went & bought 2 Brand New SUV-Car. The car was leaking Oil in the Carport. So I tried explaining to the Dumb Asses that the car was under Warrantee & all they had to do is take it back & the Dealer has to Fix it for Free. Nope To Lazy to drive it to the Dealer. Unbelievable.
2644 2018-12-03 19:48:30 Transportation isn't the only industry that uses oil.
2645 2018-12-03 19:48:23 If you bring your car to Lowe Chevy for an oil change and bring $20 worth of non perishable food items (has to have receipt) you get a free oil change. So really you spend half the cost and get to keep the rest 
2646 2018-12-03 19:48:23 Edwards is suing oil companies, expanded Medicaid and increased taxes.  Try again!
2647 2018-12-03 19:48:15 The Middle East is on a economic downward path as oil prices keep dropping as other countries explore and continue to increase production. Exasperating is continued increase in oil production by Middle East countries to keep a constant monetary income amidst dropping oil prices.
2648 2018-12-03 19:48:09 Decommissioned oil tank in 80's by cutting open and filling with sand. Fast forward to 2013 and tank removal following natural gas switch.  Three feet down strong smell oil. $13,000 later soil removed and area remediated. Don't assume your underground tank is safe. #saanich #yyj
2649 2018-12-03 19:48:05 Why is everyone who is bleating about letting the market govern oil prices so against letting the market govern cannabis stores?
2650 2018-12-03 19:47:48 Try cbd oil... its mellow, man. The good kind if you can find it
2651 2018-12-03 19:47:46 Hmm watching QP part of the @liberal_party plan to fight the fairy tale man made climate change is to take 26 million cars off the road. Tell me does anyone honestly think they will fight for the oil/gas & auto industry with such a comment. These lunatics need to go.
2652 2018-12-03 19:47:44 Indeed my Bro, one needs to attain Independent Victory 
2653 2018-12-03 19:47:27 Indian food is so peng but I actually cannot take all the oil 
2654 2018-12-03 19:47:25 OIL IT....OIL IT UP
2655 2018-12-03 19:47:24 for that fresh motor oil scent
2656 2018-12-03 19:47:20 Can’t we test for oil & gas in the WH first? I mean they say it’s safe!
2657 2018-12-03 19:47:18 One other thing until we don't have cars, plastics, cosmetics, etc etc etc we will not move off of oil.
2658 2018-12-03 19:46:55 They're more expensive, an acquaintance of mine calculated. It seems odd, since they don't have to pay shipping on water weight or metal cans, but even with all water or oil drained, the can is still cheaper. It can be so because people don't check such things themselves
2659 2018-12-03 19:46:41 My guess is they've been emboldened by China taking those first scary steps back in March starting Shanghai Oil Futures, not to mention emboldened after G20 where supposedly many delegates noted China only wanted to talk trade, while US like a jealous ex only wanted to bash China
2660 2018-12-03 19:46:29 I had an aged "goat ham" there with toasted hazelnuts and olive oil that was one of the most amazing unique-but-simple foods I've ever had. Think prosciutto but goat instead of pig.
2661 2018-12-03 19:46:28 Oil stocks represent some of the strongest gains of the day as prospects for rising oil prices increase. $cop  up over 4% $xom over 2% $bp up 2% $cvx 1.5% #oil #putinmbs #stockmarket #oilstocks #stockstowatch #Opec
2662 2018-12-03 19:46:01 Goes without saying. We're lucky in more way than one in Scotland. Good governance, plenty resources. I'm all for leaving the oil in the north sea (not going to happen) but at least we can use the revenue to make the transition to renewables. 25% of Europe's potential apparently.
2663 2018-12-03 19:45:53 Sounds like a sound plan. It’s hard to adapt to change so I feel bad for the oil folks. But we need to support retraining  for the sake of our future &!healthy living.
2664 2018-12-03 19:45:44 Tried Great Value butter chicken sauce and it's basically like eating orange oil. I'll never stray from the Costco jars again.

However exploration started last year winter duri gMugabe era. Now that exploration is overa and real work starts it is prudent to count real chicks not eggs.
2670 2018-12-03 19:45:16 This uprising in France is all about the migrant influx not so much on the oil prices?
2671 2018-12-03 19:45:16 Invade them and take their oil
2672 2018-12-03 19:45:15 Thanks, you too!  FYI see some people panting that Kessinger's father is 'selling his business' as if he owns the oil company.

2674 2018-12-03 19:45:07 Snake oil salesmen don't sell to people in large Metropolis. They prefer the Sticks and boonies. Because they think those people are less intelligent. Sadly they are mostly right.

2676 2018-12-03 19:45:00 The provincial government will intervene in the free market to try and boost Alberta oil prices. The opposition parties are on board. 

What do you make of the decision to intervene? Are you surprised that the different political parties agree?
2677 2018-12-03 19:44:46 IMO,GREED is the #1 humanity's worst enemy.What's happening to our beautiful/amazing earth, somehow/someway has something to do with GREED, either killing innocent ppl for their land/oil/minerals...destroying land for shopping centers,its minerals or....,putting chemicals in food
2678 2018-12-03 19:44:39 Oh please..  a cop and an oil industry loyalist?  This is your wet dream?
2679 2018-12-03 19:44:34 I would like to ask when will the US end subsidies for coal and oil? I say this is an example of the government picking winners and losers if all subsidies are not ended.
2680 2018-12-03 19:44:16 A tablespoon a day of Cold pressed black seed oil, Gatorade lots of it, Gatorade is bad but somehow helps with colds. Get well soon.
2681 2018-12-03 19:44:06 Tell me why my car had to break RIGHT after I spent money on new tires, a tire rotation, AND a synthetic oil change. Vehicles hate me

2688 2018-12-03 19:43:40 Maybe a fire roasted tomato or rosemary and olive oil triscuit? Omg I need to stop
2689 2018-12-03 19:43:39 To be fair, Ted Heath tried his best with 35% inflation and the 3 day week and Margaret Thatcher spent our oil revenues keeping 4 million unemployed for ten years but Brexit is not doing to happen the leamoaners tell me.
2690 2018-12-03 19:43:32 @MrsdogC Just keep swimming. Have you tried cannabis oil and a low sugar diet?
2691 2018-12-03 19:43:30 1. That’s from 2016
2. You again didn’t read the article, did you:

“In the wake of plunging oil prices, the city's unemployment rate grew from 4 .9 per cent in March 2014 to 6.9 per cent March of 2016. HungerCount says this led to a "massive" increase in food bank use.
2692 2018-12-03 19:43:27 Dude beside me smell like weed & motor oil. Them scents don’t mix well 
2693 2018-12-03 19:43:23 To all of those in east who are slamming AB for limiting oil prod, this is no different than what the dairy ind does, they limit prod to ensure their producers receive a fair price for their product.The only difference is the feds are compensating dairy for their loss of income
2694 2018-12-03 19:43:22 Barack Obama, speaking to the Baker Institute, made sure the audience of wealthy Texans, many in the oil business, gave him credit for making the United States a world leader for oil and gas production. He said, “American energy production . . .went up every year I was presi…

2696 2018-12-03 19:43:17 I was asking you. 
However as oil companies are international they invest profits in areas of the world which give the best returns. Taxation is CT and PRT predominantly and PRT is being rebated to assist with decom so is a negative number.
2697 2018-12-03 19:43:15 No one said you didn't. But ask a question, get an answer. Not sure why this one upsets you. You have forgotten more about golf than I will ever know but a few cheerleaders on twitter doesn't make you an expert on global trade or oil or economics etc, etc.
2698 2018-12-03 19:43:15 LA Vapes beside dragon garden sells CBD oil!

2700 2018-12-03 19:42:52 What I want to know is why a well read boor like you wasn’t making the point of environmental damage 20+years ago like I was instead of attempting to damage the true ethics of Christianity with falsifiable information?Technology was available to replace oil years ago & improve CC
2701 2018-12-03 19:42:51 Tire repair, oil change, & rent. Wow I’m pissed
2702 2018-12-03 19:42:34 Agreed @willfalk some restraint in the aggression is warranted.  I am deeply concerned about the extra oil by rail traffic. Like harm reduction strategies in health sometimes we are forced to pick from the lesser of two evils.
2703 2018-12-03 19:42:27 I’m getting my cars inspection and oil change done and i think that I just became friends with this nice lady that is sitting next to me, we love adulting!
2704 2018-12-03 19:42:14 Natural gas, oil and coal are all ff. Wind and solar are great, coming online, but aren’t reliable/predictable enough to be major “fuel sources” right now, especially for baseload needs because they depend on weather. Hydro is location-based and tapped out. That leaves nuclear.

Ordained my foot.

Ordained with goya oil of 150. Mtheww
2708 2018-12-03 19:41:56 I have the secret. Hot oil in the pan. Then add egg which you cover (if possible with a tranparent lid). The whole egg white cooks very quickly this way leaving the yolk lovely & runny but you have to hover. It's a question of seconds ! #MissionNotImpossible
2709 2018-12-03 19:41:53 $50 to get my oil changed? Teaching myself how to do it as we speak
2710 2018-12-03 19:41:51 I treated my car to an oil change, air filters, new windshield wipers now she gonna get a good wash 
2711 2018-12-03 19:41:48 Okay I wee bring Oil & Maggi
2712 2018-12-03 19:41:46 Isn't Saskatchewan announcing it will not cut its oil production the same as the Yukon announcing it will maintain the level of its coconut production?
2713 2018-12-03 19:41:36 Oh, boy. The Harper government phased out the accelerated capital cost allowances given to the oil sands beginning in the 1996 budget. Those were worth $300M/year. Mr. Trudeau has brought them back. At some political cost in BC.../2
2714 2018-12-03 19:41:26 OK, let's follow that through. Who is in the ruling class that wants a fake hot world. Why would they want this? What is the benefit to the ruling class - whoever that is - certainly not the oil and gas barons. Who would be behind this?
2715 2018-12-03 19:41:26 "I'm not just production manager of Big Anointing Oil, I'm also a client."
2716 2018-12-03 19:41:25 Think it wasn't Bill, but someone else.
Interviewer was outstandingly meek. There were several occasions when "Haudonaminnit" was the obvious interjection while Wood held forth on oil & later fish.
But sadly & predictably he was allowed to continue his peroration much like GBrown
2717 2018-12-03 19:41:20 Jonathan was removed for not giving Nigeria a min of $200b foreign reserve at high crude price when algeria that sold less oil saved $194b, conversely, Buhari at low crude price saved $47b in just 3yrs, you now understand why Buhari is coming back, don't you?
2718 2018-12-03 19:41:19 I need to go get a oil change before I don't have a car
2719 2018-12-03 19:40:54 Yup!

It's all the Oil of Old Lay that keeps me looking young.
2720 2018-12-03 19:40:52 If he had a progressive record, he’d be a halfway decent candidate. But he’s already taken lot’s of money from big oil. Face it, Bernie is the best candidate for 2020, aspiring pols would do well to emulate a President Sanders and move forward from there.
2721 2018-12-03 19:40:49 Interestingly these propaganda experts seem to be very interested in continuing to pump oil. 

So I see carbon as tending to ruin us socially as well as environmentally.
2722 2018-12-03 19:40:38 She doesn't understand much of crude oil prices in international market. She only understand what Modi says so no point of arguing.

2724 2018-12-03 19:40:05 As with oil, georgists are concerned with more than just how much value a landlord might extract from our commons by removing trees from wild habitat; there is also the central concern of how much those extractive activities harm others. So we'd also tax pollution externalities.
2725 2018-12-03 19:39:53 The single most important determinant of price of oil is the production levels of Saudi Arabia, and to a lesser extent Russia.

WSJ: "Crude Prices Rise After Russia, Saudi Arabia Agree to Extend Cuts"
2726 2018-12-03 19:39:53 Thank God fr puberty
2727 2018-12-03 19:39:38 You are seeing what you want to see. Trudeau has done more for oil patch workers than Harper ever did.
2728 2018-12-03 19:39:35 Customer call- get me a tune up kit for an M
Me- looking it all up, working on it
Customer- hey what's the plug gap, cyl head torque, and how much oil it need?

2729 2018-12-03 19:39:35 i come in the kitchen to bake a cake & we don’t have no damn oil . like wtf
2730 2018-12-03 19:39:28 Ajaokuta steel industry.. said to have been revived yet lying comatose... Textile industries non operational... oil refineries not functioning. with key infrastructures down... tell us how can the Nigerian economy recover?
2731 2018-12-03 19:39:28 Client na
2732 2018-12-03 19:39:25 Given he and Butts have both said they want to end the oil industry I'm skeptical.
2733 2018-12-03 19:39:02 Oil marketers wants to start their yearly December drama
2734 2018-12-03 19:39:02 what i find extra bleak is that even with prices collapsing the oil industry and a looming global climate catastrophe, the people behind this ad still sincerely believe that there is something wrong with *you*
2735 2018-12-03 19:38:44 Millennials need to know that if Spanish canned tuna in olive oil goes down before everyone tries it then we all lose.
2736 2018-12-03 19:38:43 yeah it's heavy as shit  don't worry i've been watching sword youtubers for ages, i'll clean that junk every two days with oil lmao
2737 2018-12-03 19:38:40 The de Mamiel winter night oil! Discovered their product range on cult beauty & just adore everything I’ve tried so far. If only i wasn’t currently penniless (after spending everything on your site!) 
2738 2018-12-03 19:38:40 -Hair mask for split ends and dry hair:
Ingredients:
1 tablespoon of olive oil.
1/4 cup of full fat yogurt.
How to:
Mix them together until they are completely blended together.
Apply to tips and length of hair and leave for 10-30 mins.
Then wash the mask off.
2739 2018-12-03 19:38:28 At the dealership for an oil change, I’m getting new car fever 
2740 2018-12-03 19:38:24 Man don’t try that shit.. it ain’t nothing but a fancy highfalutin microwave...PEANUT OIL my boy!!
2741 2018-12-03 19:38:05 Corbyn likes Iran partly because "your enemy's enemy, etc."
Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and the West have been "tangoing" for many decades, with both sides believing they're leading.
Oil is a factor, but western politicians are so invested politically, they can't admit they're wrong.
2742 2018-12-03 19:38:04 -those that at a distance resemble flies.
-those that at a distance resemble oil refineries.
-those that at a distance resemble beetles, or gummi bears.
2743 2018-12-03 19:37:56 Oil is a substantially larger player in the Canadian economy than it is in the U.S. I'm sure that's quite a large factor.
2744 2018-12-03 19:37:53 Cool, can also be used as kindling when the price of oil goes through the roof and when you are homeless after the impending recession
2745 2018-12-03 19:37:45 Oil and water not good combo
2746 2018-12-03 19:37:27 Plenty oil 
2747 2018-12-03 19:37:25 yeah going vegan is cool but we could also hang all the oil executives and call it a day
2748 2018-12-03 19:37:20 I use Tropic Isle Living. You can get it from most beauty supply stores. I would say any authentic brand would work. The oil itself has a strong distinctive smell and is really thick and dark brown/black
2749 2018-12-03 19:37:17 Of 12 'priority corridors' in the 2013 TEN-E regulation, 5 are fossil fuels (4 gas, 1 oil). Meanwhile, hydrogen is missing and smart grids restricted.

With a new strategy for a climate neutral EU by 2050, surely it's time for the EU to reassess its infrastructure priorities?
2750 2018-12-03 19:37:10 -Hair mask for silky hair:
Ingredients:
2 tablespoons of coconut oil or almond oil or vanilla oil.
1 table spoon of honey.
How to:
Mix together.
Heat for 10-20 seconds so it applies easily.
Massage the mask onto your scalp then cover with showercap or towel for 25 mins to 1 hour.
2751 2018-12-03 19:37:07 Surprisingly enough, Moe's not wrong for once. Entirely. Saskatchewan does have some small oil sand plays, but the difference in quality between those and what's produced in northern Alberta is remarkable, imo
2752 2018-12-03 19:36:57 Oil also.
2753 2018-12-03 19:36:53 If you need change and hope to vote Babu Owino to bring the change, you are waiting for a matatu in a railway station!
2754 2018-12-03 19:36:30 When asked about remaining oil estimate on #gms today Wood replies "if you leave the politics out of it ...".

2757 2018-12-03 19:36:18 We also had the post-downturn benefit of a few years of decent oil prices, which rebounded quite smartly.
2758 2018-12-03 19:36:11 lmao i went to get my oil changed and i didn’t realize it was a full service. These poor dudes are cleaning like 6 months of garbage out of my car 
2759 2018-12-03 19:36:09 Thanks to you Mr President WE WILL ALL HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH OIL! God Bless you Sir and your Remarkable Family!
2760 2018-12-03 19:35:58 Fun fact: one time I fried my eggs in habanero sauce instead of oil and I almost died. I still ate them tho :)

Nose job
2764 2018-12-03 19:35:22 Same! I have been doing it as an overnight mask or after any drying masks. Sometimes layer over @mydrunkelephant serum and oil if I'm feeling frisky. I also got the new @summer__fridays Overtime mask and the DE Baby Facial. @Sephora Rouge is a blessing and a curse.

2781 2018-12-03 19:33:39 Instead of focusing on the real polluters and third world countries choking the oceans with plastic let's all focus on Trump not signing a non binding meaningless agreement.

2789 2018-12-03 19:33:14 I suspect it is - but there are issues around sourcing, ethical farming, palm oil... so that the more I look at it, the more of a minefield I find it. Is “ethical veganism” a next step for vegans?

2792 2018-12-03 19:32:56 I don't even apologize I just return to my lair of darkness and expect my family to understand my actions

2794 2018-12-03 19:32:53 Canned tuna in water is trash but canned tuna in olive oil is still a staple in my house. Perfect on white beans with lemon and olive oil.
2795 2018-12-03 19:32:51 is the oil pop over?

2804 2018-12-03 19:32:23 Why would they do that?  Is the oil industry that powerful?
2805 2018-12-03 19:32:19 @jengerson Having read your CBC piece, I'm curious—is there a better politician/group Notley could have allied herself with than Trudeau? NDP don't seem likely to support her stance on oil, and federal and provincial conservatives are firmly set against her environmental policies
2806 2018-12-03 19:32:15 So y'all are really out here reporting Sex Workers for making side money?? BET. I'm about to report every last one of you ItWorks hoes, all you Scentsy bitches & don't even think I forgot about you Essential Oil motherfuckers.

2808 2018-12-03 19:32:14 Is this a lasting oil bounce in your opinion?
2809 2018-12-03 19:32:12 RBS is in effect Nat West English Bank.
Woods oil and fish business cosy in Westminster..
Ineos is a London based Company.
2810 2018-12-03 19:32:08 It is at least possible but it is more likely that Dick Cheney started the war to get access to the oil in Iraq for his industry patrons.
Also, has anyone figured out WTF is going on with Pat's head?
2811 2018-12-03 19:31:58 The georgist policy playbook also contains more than simply LVT. Natural values that can be removed from locations, such as forests, are not subject to merely an annual property assessment; there is a "severance tax" for cutting away something of value (like for oil in Alaska).

2815 2018-12-03 19:31:17 Yeah maybe it's connected - oil and whatnot. My skin is pretty youthful looking for my age.
2816 2018-12-03 19:31:14 Yes, but not enough & not fast enough. I would rather see the fed gov't fund a massive initiative to build refining capacity rapidly than to watch as Trudon't wastes $15-20Bn on a pipeline that exports more jobs than it creates and leaves us vulnerable to world oil supplies.

2819 2018-12-03 19:30:58 Jamaican castor oil!
2820 2018-12-03 19:30:53 Your idea that the oil will be produced regardless of what we do about supply is a self fulfilling prophecy (and an assumption, so is circular reasoning). I see no compelling substantive arguments against limiting supply, and lots of reasons to do it.
2821 2018-12-03 19:30:51 Crude running into the close!!!

2827 2018-12-03 19:30:27 All ears but not listening to a word of wisdom or concern from Scotland FM, an abdication of the PMs role to protect the country at large,she must put the country first not her party! Using the likes of Ian Woods who lied re oil revenues in 2014 when knowing the truth is not good
2828 2018-12-03 19:30:06 Schumacher o theosa oil 
2829 2018-12-03 19:30:05 Texas is booming. But Alberta is forced to temporarily lower oil production in order to avoid an even bigger crisis. The direct result of harmful government policies in recent years. Well not that recently about 5-8 years ago now.
2830 2018-12-03 19:30:00 Both the provincial government and opposition agree that a mandatory cut to oil production will boost the price of Alberta oil, and prevent layoffs. 

What do you think? Was it the right decision? Call now and let us know: 1-866-468-4422.
2831 2018-12-03 19:30:00 I have always loved how oil moves up or down a dollar in about 5 min.
2832 2018-12-03 19:29:48 "Emu Oil?"
2833 2018-12-03 19:29:46 When I see how Qatar and Saudi Arabia are using their oil money I just sit and ask myself if my country is selling coconut oil.
2834 2018-12-03 19:29:27 Titan has some oil
2835 2018-12-03 19:29:24 This mufucka just told me it's a 4 hour wait for an oil change
2836 2018-12-03 19:29:23 At the same time, we should be aggressively reducing oil demand by setting dates certain after which no more ICEs can be sold. We should take away mandatory parking minimums in cities and require denser development near transit.
2837 2018-12-03 19:29:16 they’re really good. they just fry them in oil and they’re sweet.
2838 2018-12-03 19:29:01 At least they have ice cream that is made with actual butter and cream ... no palm oil in sight. I don't mind paying extra for something made from proper ingredients.
2839 2018-12-03 19:28:44 I guess u don dey dig for oil there too. Sho'gun la'iye ni 
2840 2018-12-03 19:28:40 I entirely disagree there. The collection and use of oil have negative effects on the environment. The sooner that we can faze oil out and replace it with renewables and newer nuclear power the better.
2841 2018-12-03 19:28:38 oil ? #oott spiking dunno why?
2842 2018-12-03 19:28:38 Government ought to stay out of this! Nothing good ever happens when they meddle. Oil companies perfectly capable of doing this themselves when it is necessary
2843 2018-12-03 19:28:37 Try not to think so much about / The truly staggering amount of oil that it takes to make a record - Father John Misty
2844 2018-12-03 19:28:29 Oil is down across the board. The U.S. is the #1 exporter of oil and natural gas on the planet, and as goes The U.S. and Saudi Arabia, so goes the market. We are swimming in surplus oil...try again!
2845 2018-12-03 19:28:28 So Trump economic advisor Larry Kudlow is threatening to cut all EV subsidies because GM is closing plants. This serves multiple purposes. 1. It boosts oil sales by making EV more expensive. 2. It works with the Trump narrative that climate change is not man made.....
2846 2018-12-03 19:28:23 Me: CBD oil and crystals are so dumb, they don’t do anything.

Also me: Buys a 3oz bottle of clear liquid claiming to be cat pheromones and a wall diffuser for $36 to help my indoor cat feel less stressed in her space.
2847 2018-12-03 19:28:18 Please Tommy, let that thing move the oil around just a little longer before you rev it like that....
2848 2018-12-03 19:28:18 Oil & Gas are finite resources, the more you use the less there is, that isn’t geology. Gross financial mismanagement - want to say more?
2849 2018-12-03 19:28:12 Wake up early...a very simple solution. Muggers and pickpocketers are also known to board matatus. Restore your brains.
2850 2018-12-03 19:28:04 I'd like to hear about the artic refuge changes that the Trump admin is making for oil exploration. I know very little about it.
2851 2018-12-03 19:27:54 Good.  I hope they settle down soon. I know diluted lavender oil is good for scars when they're healing but I'm not sure about the stage yours are at. X
2852 2018-12-03 19:27:45 เมื่อไหร่จะเจองานที่ใช่ ที่ทำทุกวันละไม่เบื่อ ที่ทำทุกวันละมีความสุข ทำละตัวเรารับผิดชอบเอง ไม่ต้องให้คนอื่นมานั่งรับผิดกะเรา เบื่อ อยากทำอะไรก็ได้ตามใจเรา
2853 2018-12-03 19:27:42 No no. It’s good. Produce less oil. And up the price so that it will push people to cheaper electric vehicles. Keep it up #Alberta!
2854 2018-12-03 19:27:34 Now we all can see your greatest oil equation again 
2855 2018-12-03 19:27:33 Interesting. Regardless of what Audubon has done, or other BS you throw out, I’m still  opposed to making money for a few oil and gas execs, in order to completely f up the Arctic. Have a wonderful day.
2856 2018-12-03 19:27:23 Organizing around stopping supply is also useful for building a movement and taking away the license of fossil fuel companies to operate without regard for public welfare. Many subsidies and built in advantages for the oil industry still exist, and those need to all go away.
2857 2018-12-03 19:27:21 John Paxson is a fuckin moron why don’t he coach the team since all he wants is yes men. Bulls need to really clean house. Paxson still selling snake oil biggest con artist in Chicago Bulls history
2858 2018-12-03 19:26:54 With gasoline prices at an all-time high and crude oil prices sucking wind, maybe it's time to get serious about refining our own oil.
2859 2018-12-03 19:26:49 i want one of those thc oil pens for christmas.
2860 2018-12-03 19:26:47 I hope Makali hurry and change my oil so this $1.95 gas I copped in Op last a little longer lol
2861 2018-12-03 19:26:47 put CBD oil in a juul pod & i feel groovy
2862 2018-12-03 19:26:30 Qatar oil production is equivalent to one oil well production in KSA so is nothing
2863 2018-12-03 19:26:28 like oil the greedies who do meat don't want to give up anything

2866 2018-12-03 19:26:05 $54 for a oil change .. bitch my heart 
2867 2018-12-03 19:25:56 @dalefranklintv could we have a New Year healthy food fest? That would be great! Ps what can I do with foreman’s lobster oil?
2868 2018-12-03 19:25:54 That too! In fact there is more than one reason to end Saudi oil in Canada. There are several. Jamal Khashoggi, Saudi expulsion of Canadian diplomat, Saudi cancellation of Canadian grain shipments... Canadian jobs!
2869 2018-12-03 19:25:45 @THRIVEmkt sells the best almond butter with no palm oil
2870 2018-12-03 19:25:40 If we stop oil drilling in the arctic and offshore, that will constrain US production. If we make the industry pay for cleanup of legacy wells, that will constrain US production. There is nothing wrong with cracking down on industry, and we should.
2871 2018-12-03 19:25:38 Ye England has used up all its coal and oil let’s stop fossil fuel now lol well we have none left seems right time to stop it by the way climate change has hap many many times in earths history
2872 2018-12-03 19:25:37 Just in case you didn’t know, nothing takes sticky resin off fingers like a few drops of coconut oil. #cannabis #liveresin #resin

2874 2018-12-03 19:25:15 My question is how come all of a sudden there are fuel shortages, particularly after elections. Even nguva ya Bob we could easily get. Or there is war between the oil mafias?
2875 2018-12-03 19:25:13 Man, I do not like pau ferro and grenadillo. They look the same color when they're dry as they do when they're properly oiled! The only way I can tell if they're oiled is to just keep soaking the board until it stops absorbing, so I'm going through my fingerboard oil like crazy!

2879 2018-12-03 19:24:18 One area,where enforcement of immigration law would help. Certain states and federal system is 25% illegal aliens. Secure borders, deport criminals and keep them out. Some Americans may be rehabilitated using these resources.

2881 2018-12-03 19:24:07 The Port of Cromarty Firth Authority has confirmed it will not pursue its controversial plans to seek ship-to-ship oil transfer licence ‘due to higher priority projects’ 
Campaigners @cromartyrising received high profile backing against plans from supporters including @Beathhigh
2882 2018-12-03 19:24:06 I shouldve added some olive oil like I usually do. I forgot it since I made these after a couple of months. :(
2883 2018-12-03 19:24:03 If I sink any lower than I am now, I'd prolly find oil.
2884 2018-12-03 19:24:00 That was quite careless of that buy-out firm though. Much of Nigeria's economic woes that have happened recently were very predictable. That they still fell victim speaks to their competence/knowledge of the Nigerian and global oil markets.
2885 2018-12-03 19:23:59 That’s works in theory, but I was talking to my friend who has insomnia as well (she’s one of the few that hasn’t even had any success with cbd oil..trying to figure out if she could use it differently or something bc it’s a lifesaver)...and 1/2

2887 2018-12-03 19:23:44 Agree...but make sure while you're at it you remove them for oil, gas and coal. Carry-on!
2888 2018-12-03 19:23:37 Plus lower oil prices, cutting  Pu-boy's danegeld.
2889 2018-12-03 19:23:36 The guy who lobbied for VP rushed back to where he belong, he even hosted their campaign in his state 2day
2890 2018-12-03 19:23:35 Don’t believe the price of oil BS. That’s pushed by the media.  Oil is very low price.... they are protesting an oil tax!!
2891 2018-12-03 19:23:30 I understand oil markets quite well, having studied them for decades. Your view is one held by the beltway conventional wisdom folks who always denigrate supply side constraints (and who wrote the Keystone EIR), but I strongly disagree with your conclusions.
2892 2018-12-03 19:23:26 There is an alternative. Walk. Walking has never killed anyone. People from rural areas walk for kilometres and they are still surviving. Stop populist politics Sarakasija!
2893 2018-12-03 19:23:22 My boyfriend: always changes his oil on time, knows more about cars than I ever will, could back into a parking spot with his eyes closed, overall excellent driver 

Also my boyfriend: didn’t know what a coupe was
2894 2018-12-03 19:23:21 No matter what the news is gas in bc is going up. If the price falls heavily or there is too much oil gas will come down 1 cent per liter and we will forget.
2895 2018-12-03 19:23:19 Not sure why Ottawa is to blame for the mismanagement of Alberta’s finances & resources, the oil industry’s short sightedness and failure to respond to market conditions and the global oil prices?
2896 2018-12-03 19:23:19 Lol well where you go plays a factor and the type of oil your car requires. If you ain’t driving luxury tho your oil change could be $40
2897 2018-12-03 19:23:17 I got some new beard oil yesterday and it has me flourishing on this beautiful Monday.

2901 2018-12-03 19:22:44 My oil change went up to $70 so catch me riding around on a scooter from now on 
2902 2018-12-03 19:22:39 SK is guilty too, but so is the rest of Canada.
We need a #JustTransition from oil so we have support of oil, gas, and coal workers who need may need retraining and new employment.
2903 2018-12-03 19:22:32 this why i need a man. they asking me all these questions about which oil brand i want for my oil change. baby idk  better eenie meeny miny mo because i dont know the difference
2904 2018-12-03 19:22:28 Baby oil girl keep it on for half hour comes off like a charm x
2905 2018-12-03 19:22:24 Roaming the showroom while waiting for the oil to get changed in my car. I don't see a single hamster anywhere. Has Kia finally retired that mascot?
2906 2018-12-03 19:22:22 Yess  cause castor oil just go give you gas & the shits bruh you dont want that .
2907 2018-12-03 19:22:17 It’s so sad that as a women to go get an oil change you have to defend yourself so you don’t get taken advantage of...
2908 2018-12-03 19:22:17 Diversified Oil & Gas (DGOC) issued a first class operational update this morning! It’s a real shame @DGO_AIM /IR Team didn’t deem it worthy of a tweet! Well done to the operational team for hitting 70,000 BOPD and an annualised adjusted EBITDA of $283 million! Congrats #DGOC
2909 2018-12-03 19:21:58 The quran repeatedly states that non believers will burn forever in hell. Even doused in oil when the skin is gone to make it worse. Why do I deserve this? Good thing I dont believe in god or an afterlife. I live here and now and try to make the best of it for myself and others.
2910 2018-12-03 19:21:57 another trade blow up like Natty/Oil?
2911 2018-12-03 19:21:52 This is a complex topic. What sources are included? Where are the emissions associated with imported products counted?  How about the emissions associated with oil and gas extraction? How about natural emissions associated with climate change? What are the trends by nation?
2912 2018-12-03 19:21:46 The people who could do something about my situation are totally indifferent... Politicians Lawyers and media are ignoring the issue for fear of annoying the oil company who caused it
2913 2018-12-03 19:21:43 She’s at the barrel again with that old duffer
How’s the oil stocks doing ?
2914 2018-12-03 19:21:39 Facts only. I listened in to some higher ups talking today. And when I say higher ups. I mean like top 30 discussion makers in Petro Oil
2915 2018-12-03 19:21:36 Hahahahaha sana oil
2916 2018-12-03 19:21:30 I hope that’s lube and not baby oil cuz you not fucking up my PH Balance 
2917 2018-12-03 19:21:04 Inés, el gobierno okupa lo que tiene que hacer es convocar elecciones. Por qué el del avión ,no deja de contaminar el cielo con tanto viaje .Y quiere quitar el oil.
2918 2018-12-03 19:20:56 @stranahan Looks like Apco connection breaking. Not hearing OIL though.

2920 2018-12-03 19:20:52 Lavender essential oil and water in a spray bottle. Spray on your pillow before sleep nd if that doesnt work, melatonin gummies. Momma swears by them!
2921 2018-12-03 19:20:43 to be fair on Scandic I came to his defence with a few wires crossed.
Oh I will keep drinking the tea..keeps me going here.
2922 2018-12-03 19:20:40 The original plan was to work in an oil company and chop oil money, but then engineering mathematics happened and I found myself on twitter doing "follow me I follow back" 
2923 2018-12-03 19:20:34 Patricia, I like you, but let's not forget the war criminal Bush is not a good man.

Why don't you stick to oil trader, rather then glorifying war CRIMINALS LIKE BUSH?

Peace & respect upon you.
2924 2018-12-03 19:20:33 #AAOG is too cheap with 5000bopd+ potential. Expect a big rerate any day now as the drill bit will hit first oil zone at any day now.
2925 2018-12-03 19:20:32 As I posted earlier that the sole reason OPEC exists is to keep price high.If they cannot control oil price then OPEC won't exist and petrodollar will also not exist because OPEC helped dollar to remain important (power game).#Qatar to exit OPEC...Beginning of end of OPEC.
2926 2018-12-03 19:20:15 The only oil he can take credit for is the oil he rubs on his face!
2927 2018-12-03 19:20:06 Brushes matter so much. I remember when I discovered a certain mixer brush, changed everything, and when I lost a an dry oil brush I could no longer do a kind of paintstyle anymore.... real shame that was....
2928 2018-12-03 19:20:05 They actually listed less than 2000 people impacted directly, wow! In the whole Niger Delta... without the cleanup of the oil spillages from the waters... Ok

2931 2018-12-03 19:19:43 This climate change introducing higher tax at the fuel station is nothing more than,'politicians worried about' so where are our wages going to come from. Road tax goes straight into the coffer to pay MP's wages. As oil runs out they have to come up with something new!
2932 2018-12-03 19:19:42 2 years :-))....average long cycle project in North Sea shallow water, with best-in-class regularsand service contractors, is 5 years. That is from discovery to first oil. Brazil: 7-12y!
2933 2018-12-03 19:19:42 After a life and economic threatening climate report is released, the destructive ideas keep coming: drilling for oil. In Alaska. In a protected area. We’re all going to die.

2935 2018-12-03 19:19:29 Apparently there is a glut of oil in US states as well.  Over production of shale.  Alberta you're not alone.
2936 2018-12-03 19:19:28 Now France as to pay their fair sure of @NATO thanks to Pres, Trump, now the PPL of France knows how it feels to have their Taxes, oil price & the cost of living go up, NO FREE RIDE BY AMERICANS ANYMORE.
2937 2018-12-03 19:19:20 @pakpmo are you dumb or naive admitting on TV you didn't know your national Bank governor devalued the rupee. What kind of pm are you!
2938 2018-12-03 19:19:19 I remember meals I had in secondary school that I wish I could recreate now. Saturday morning yam and palm oil slathered in butter (read Blue Band) with a sprinkling of salt and dried pepper, being my top one. What’s yours?
2939 2018-12-03 19:19:08 Aside from "a single test hole" BP and Chevron drilled more than 30 years ago there is not a reliable idea of how much oil is present? 
Are there any estimates?

Why does ASRC have "enthusiasm for drilling" while other oil folks have said there probably isn't much there?
2940 2018-12-03 19:19:07 @SecretaryZinke Please slow down oil extraction in beautiful #ANWR that is meant to be a wildlife refuge for the long-term benefit of many, not the oil and gas mining site for the short-term benefit of a select few #greatestgood #forthegreatestnumber #TheseAmericanGospels

2949 2018-12-03 19:18:33 Sure you have to curb production if the country is so against Alberta oil. It’s time we Albertans built refineries and ship a finished product rather then give away our natural resources. Do the right thing refine Alberta

2951 2018-12-03 19:18:23 Nothing like pro market  @AndrewScheer blaming PM for AB oil dilemma when #cpc & market did little to plan for price down turn for decade. Harper couldn’t build pipe either.

2955 2018-12-03 19:18:03 2015 was an oil and gas recession, manufacturing chains not exposed to E&P were ok. but yes, same reasoning applies. Past crises in developed market suggest one sector needs to be >15-20% of GDP to cause system-wide problems, IMO.

3001 2018-12-03 19:13:45 The challenge between fixed and variable prices-

A few years ago I had a friend who purchased home heating fuel (fuel oil) at the beginning of the season (fixed price), as she was convinced prices would go up.  When prices went down by about 50%, she was not happy.
3002 2018-12-03 19:13:43 Jaelin: While Bush was alive the media demonized him...just like they do to Trump now. They said Bush got involved in the Middle East war because of the oil...
They said Bush was in the oil business and wanted the war to make money for himself.
3003 2018-12-03 19:13:34 When do subsidies for coal and oil end?  Never if you are Trump and GOP. He’s not just promoting fossil fuels, he’s sabotaging alternatives, just like he’s sabotaging ACA.
3004 2018-12-03 19:13:30 apparently he and his new fiancé (wife?) own the olive oil company. tbh that doesn't sound like a bad way to retire from being a famous person.
3005 2018-12-03 19:13:23 I'm not sure how to get around it.. friggin' gravity. I find that fish oil helps a lot for my knees... my neck.. nothing helps that.  The most important thing for me is to remember I'm not 18 and I need to carry things close to my center, never hold them out or twist, bend knees.
3006 2018-12-03 19:13:12 Brominated vegetable oil, or BVO, which acts as an emulsifier in citrus-flavored soda drinks, is found in about 10 percent of sodas sold in the U.S.
3007 2018-12-03 19:13:10 That doesn't mean an increase in oil production didn't happen under Obama though. It's like when conservatives give Trump credit for a great stock mark...

3008 2018-12-03 19:13:09 From 41/2 billion a day across Canada. Peanuts. What BS. We are being robbed by foreign oil companies and bamboozled by our governments and bought media. It's your oil so WAKE up Canadians.
3009 2018-12-03 19:13:04 Maybe Canadians could protest oil tankers from the Middle East as hard as they do oil from Alberta ? Crazy concept eh ?
3010 2018-12-03 19:13:02 imperial oil  sees Canada as a gold plated place to exploit. That USA company wanted the cheapest oil in the entire world to stay to be the very very cheapest oil in the world. So disrecpfull of them. Imperial disrespect Canada to the fullest intend possible

3013 2018-12-03 19:12:51 @AlbertaatNoon the premier had to make some moves, no one in this country seems able to build pipelines, no one seems able to get oil to tidewater. It’s a bit reactive but at least she is working for Alberta unlike the past 40 year governments!!!

Trump is holding ties to Saudi Arabia for oil prices to stay under control. We CANNOT go into every country & tell them how to do bznz.
3023 2018-12-03 19:11:38 Considering that the Govt. makes more off oil in taxes than the Oil companies make in profit, I would say they have paid their fair share. You know what a subsidy to the oil companies is dont you? Govt. saying we could tax u 35% but we are going to let u slide on 30%.

3033 2018-12-03 19:10:52 CNN blames French riots on "a leap in the wholesale price of oil worldwide" which they say is partly due to Trump's sanctions on Iran.

But European oil prices have *fallen* 30% in the past two months. Anything to blame Trump, instead of Macron.
3034 2018-12-03 19:10:50 The competitors had foreseen the problem and booked rail use ahead. The 4 companies that did not have the foresight are now rewarded with an exemption, the smart ones are penalized with a carbon tax. Government should stay OUT of the oil business.
3035 2018-12-03 19:10:47 At it's most basic level this is the same "taxpayer subsidy" @SenSanders et al condemn Walmart for, or even worse.

3044 2018-12-03 19:10:07 @gop @realDonaldTrump - One thing Republicans should be known for is providing incentives for "going green" or cutting down on gasoline/oil usage, rather than more and more taxes. Wonder what the DEMs will do if all cars are battery operated and the gasoline tax revenue drops.

3054 2018-12-03 19:09:22 In the last 3 decades the tax collected on oil has only covered the deficit in 6 years. It has helped us close the gap no doubt but there is no evidence we could have built an oil fund and had the same public spending that we have had without massive tax rises.

3063 2018-12-03 19:08:53 Especially from oil companies.
3064 2018-12-03 19:08:51 FIRST UAE ASTRONAUT TO FLY TO SPACE IN 2019, DATE TO BE SET LATER - ROGOZIN: IFX

there's no oil on the moon habibi
3065 2018-12-03 19:08:48 I remember when media hero Saddam Hussein set Kuwait’s oil fields on fire. We had to send the Texans in to avert environmental disaster.
3066 2018-12-03 19:08:45 And what an oil spill would to to that Strait.
3067 2018-12-03 19:08:43 came to get a basic oil change then they went on to tell me all the things i need to get fixed... so now i am leaving here with $200 less than i came here with 
3068 2018-12-03 19:08:38 Nonsense. More oil lowers prices for consumers and increased tax revenue. Protecting the artic is nothing more than a religious dogma.
3069 2018-12-03 19:08:36 Any idea on how to get beard maintenance oil? Not to initiate growth,  but to maintain.
3070 2018-12-03 19:08:26 Omegaz oil capsulez, turmeric widz black pepper coz u needz da pepper to helpz itz absorbz, vit b 12(da methylcobalamin andz sublingual form, solgar does it) andz a b multi vitaminz. Dontz skimpz on gudz fatz in foodz
3071 2018-12-03 19:08:16 My grandparents liked wood & coal, oil & natural gas. It works very efficiently & creates great amounts of energy. Why force people to live w/less serving a false god of climate change? Let’s ask a wooly mammoth or saber tooth or a dinosaur what happened to them?..
3072 2018-12-03 19:08:14 please fam
recommend a good, moisturizer/lotion that's reasonably priced and heals dry, chapped winter skin.
so sick of mixing coconut oil, cocoa butter, vit. E, A and other ineffective ingredients. 
hit me up! fast! 
3073 2018-12-03 19:08:14 Let me guess: tax breaks...charge them nothing eh?  extract all the oil you want for free
3074 2018-12-03 19:08:12 While we still get the bulk of our oil from Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Angola making up a big chunk these days. But Trump is playing nice with him because of oil and guess Cyril is doing the same. Buy more cheap oil reserves only to sell in a dodgy deal again for a few to benefit
3075 2018-12-03 19:08:04 Merely looking at you, your injection won't be painfulajebo injection
3076 2018-12-03 19:08:03 about 15% reduction of oil prices could get us back to where you took over.
3077 2018-12-03 19:08:01 The fact that a provincial Premier has to cut production because others in the country have blocked access to getting oil to market is not a healthy situation. But of course Canada also has provincial trade restrictions that make the country unique (in a dysfunctional way).
3078 2018-12-03 19:07:59 I suppose extensions/expansions of solar & wind, but since those all affect the budget, pretty sure Congress is the decider. They're the ones doing the late year "tax extenders" for biodiesel and some act ~Dec 2015 was good for solar (and maybe wind) and in trade oil got xpts.
3079 2018-12-03 19:07:53 @CarolineD84 my favourite is chocolate with a few drops of peppermint oil. After eight for the win!! #12daysofHB
3080 2018-12-03 19:07:53 My daughter has a sinus infection and has used Olbas oil to decongest. Lots of Olbas oil. The lining of my entire respiratory tract has dissolved. I shall never smell anything else but Olbas oil in my entire life.
3081 2018-12-03 19:07:45 @IrinaSlav1 Hi Irina, Are you available for a conversation on CBC News Network tonight on the current state of global oil prices and where  Canada fits in the big picture?
3082 2018-12-03 19:07:44 Oh yeah, name two ways entrepreneurship would have fixed this oil issue
3083 2018-12-03 19:07:38 Like coal, natural gas and oil? I think people in the third world need affordable energy to develop economic growth.
3084 2018-12-03 19:07:37 Baby oil and comb :)
3085 2018-12-03 19:07:34 Real talk does anyone know a good brand of affordable oil paints? I want to start using them more but...at what cost?
3086 2018-12-03 19:07:25 Problem is that in this analogy...oil changes are $850 and air filters cost $150 and you have to buy two a month.
3087 2018-12-03 19:07:24 Sir Ian 'the oil is about to run out' Wood, Knight of the Thistle, ermine-in-waiting?
That Sir Ian Wood?
Oh Theresa...must try harder!
3088 2018-12-03 19:07:23 The one in the fish net outfit made for Marlene the Whale dress series. Really needs to be at the dry docks to push oil tankers into their birthings.
3089 2018-12-03 19:07:15 Lots of talk of bold action but there isn't any current technology to transition to. Nuclear does it for electricity but you don't like that and nothing on horizon for ships, planes and trucks. Oil, coal and gas all set to increase thru 2040 because they work. Where is your plan?
3090 2018-12-03 19:07:09 Your lack of understanding of the oil industry is exposed with that comment. Regardless, I am not happy this is a government caused glut and the solution is as bad as the problem.
3091 2018-12-03 19:07:04 Trophy hunting, hunting of mama bears & their cubs, repeal of ESA, abolish all environmental protections, declaring methane, asbestos, lead &radiation not 2 harmful to humans. Increased subsidies to polluters & oil industry. Taxcutscam. Theft of tax payer $.
3092 2018-12-03 19:07:02 For and against the Alberta oil $WCS production cuts  $IMO $SU $HSE  $CNQ $CVE $ECA
3093 2018-12-03 19:07:00 But it’s just shredded potatoes fried in oil, I’m sure you can whip them up lol  
3094 2018-12-03 19:06:59 Sir Ian Wood, the guy who told us in 2014 in the run up to the vote on independence that Scotland had no oil left. He knew fine that was a lie. So perhaps we should just believe the complete opposite of what he says. Or just tell him to jog the fuck on.
3095 2018-12-03 19:06:27 Hahahahaha how can he sell oil if he can't travel abroad bcos export is what will lift this nation
3096 2018-12-03 19:06:26 To repeat: In the oil business, unlike other industries, local attempts to cut supply per se have no impact on global/U.S. production or demand. They do nothing except waste time, money and political capital - and can weaken the alliances we need to reduce consumption. 1/2
3097 2018-12-03 19:06:10 In Historic Decision, Qatar Unexpectedly Says Will Quit OPEC Jan. 1
 
Is a 'mutiny' brewing at the world's largest oil cartel?
3098 2018-12-03 19:06:09 This morning I have taken a final, gotten a flat tire fixed, and got an oil change #adulting
3099 2018-12-03 19:05:58 The best confirmation of it that Ive found is that Ive seen oil searchers who use a similar tech say they've set off earthquakes before.  But look into Tesla's scalar waves, and the odd clouds above the earthquake zones. Many people believe HAARP is capable of it.
3100 2018-12-03 19:05:53 I need to get my car detailed and oil changed so badly 
3101 2018-12-03 19:05:47 Now we’re cookin w/ oil
3102 2018-12-03 19:05:46 This 18 yr old girl is outside autozone with a similarly aged boy watching while the az employee dives under her hood... To check the oil level. Sis I hope that's your brother next to you coz that's embarrassing af if that's your mans
3103 2018-12-03 19:05:35 Believe magnesium can help... epsom salts baths, or transdermal Mg oil (eg from @betteryou_ltd)
3104 2018-12-03 19:05:28 I know that Gwagon in and out, got a ride in it during the certificate brouhaha
3105 2018-12-03 19:05:19 to all the weed vaporizersssss: do y’all prefer the THC oil or dabs?
3106 2018-12-03 19:05:12 RT @LivingSafely: Eating Propyl Alcohol this December? Used as a synthetic flavoring, it's made from natural gas and fusel oil.
3107 2018-12-03 19:05:10 1/x The neo-liberal elite betrayed ordinary people, acted for global corporations, Big Business, Big Banks, Big Oil, and lined their own pockets in the acting, via international agencies laid waste to Africa and Latin America, sold arms to repressive regimes ...
3108 2018-12-03 19:05:07 Doing the wrong thing on their own because oil supremacy is drilled into the minds of most law makers who haven't considered the implications of choosing interchanges over real change. They're proxies for Big Oil.
3109 2018-12-03 19:05:04 No le pidas a un economista de escritorio que entienda el campo, con un TC bajando, tasas al 60%, inflación alta, derechos de exportación, demás impuestos, transporte subiendo, gas oil subiendo, insumos con dolar de $40, es imposible
3110 2018-12-03 19:05:04 Low on power steering oil, has a healthy leak. Tires jacked up too high. Getting oil change at Petro-can Yorkton.  Free water. My rear differential oil looks fantastic. Great service. Feel brand new in my 94 crv Honda.
3111 2018-12-03 19:04:59 Wait till you ask for more
3112 2018-12-03 19:04:53 no offence but cooking tofu with a bit of oil will not make you fat and IT will TASTE better don’t listen to the raw till 4 cult !
3113 2018-12-03 19:04:53 What is your / Islamic Republic's responsibility in regard to all the crimes & genocide committed?! What has been your responsibility for the past 40 years in regard to looting Iranian people's wealth plundering oil & gas and putting everything in your pockets?! Criminals!
3114 2018-12-03 19:04:35 Top 5 things I’m bullish on:

#5 Monero

#xrp #xrparmy #hemp #ushemp #rspo #palmoil #xmr #monero
3115 2018-12-03 19:04:30 Could be - not sure 

Could also be a dummy spit, Saudis trying to isolate them with the blockade, oil is nothing compared to LNG, and it could also be indicative of fractures in OPEC as Saudis dictate terms to smaller players??
3116 2018-12-03 19:04:21 Absolute big lie, diliberately ignorant, does @AndrewScheer have any decency or honesty? @JustinTrudeau is not to blame for the end of oil & petrol cars.
3117 2018-12-03 19:04:19 You must be out of your mind. How about you start fixing the problems at home. Get rid of you BS carbon tax, which is killing business in Canada. This also causing investors not to invest in Canda, you have been determined to kill the oil and gas sector. 1/2
3118 2018-12-03 19:04:18 A positive side effect of the mandatory production cuts by @RachelNotley is that it gives an out to oil companies to do what they've been wanting to do but were afraid to do so not to disappoint analysts & shareholders.

3119 2018-12-03 19:04:15 i agree, the world markets are about to experience a full out depression that makes 2008 seem pretty mild.  Cash is King with smaller plays in OIL, metals and VXX.  Netflix is a buy once the dust settles a bit. people will cut their food bill before canceling netflix
3120 2018-12-03 19:04:13 Not sure..seems to be some sort of oil to coolant heat exchanger?
3121 2018-12-03 19:04:12 All I want for Christmas is an oil change, vacuum, and new bed frame
3122 2018-12-03 19:04:08 In specific order I need
A hot oil massage
Amazing Dick 
A hot shower 
Great nights sleep 
& I’ll be good for a while 
3123 2018-12-03 19:04:07 I just ate a little box of plain raw salad but I’m not stopping my fast timer bc I’m sure it was under 200kcal and I’m having some more castor oil in an hour
3124 2018-12-03 19:04:05 That isn't exactly a bad thing. The earlier that relic is binned, the better for the world. 
Crude oil at this point in history should be phased out.
3125 2018-12-03 19:03:53 And that bitch is...US.  The US has been the "bully bitch" in the Saudi oil harem for so long, fighting anyone our Sunni master doesn't like. Even Cheney's plans to steal Russia's oil via the Caucasus corridor (Afghanistan, northern Iraq, Syria) have come to naught but Kompromat.
3126 2018-12-03 19:03:46 He’s objecting oil into his arms
3127 2018-12-03 19:03:40 and who cares about the future of the planet and the existence of mankind as long as a few oil executives stay rich for the next few years, right?
3128 2018-12-03 19:03:30 The first time am loving injection
3129 2018-12-03 19:03:30 Any city in U.S. that wants to take on oil industry can do so through zoning, parking, transit, housing regs. I've never even heard of the oil lobby having political influence at any City Hall. 

Bernie Sanders endorsed local NIMBY candidates. Did oil industry make him do that?
3130 2018-12-03 19:03:22 Oil wants to go a little higher imo
3131 2018-12-03 19:03:15 Oil investment?
3132 2018-12-03 19:03:14 If America gets to a point where they allow a convention of states, all hope is lost for the ordinary citizen. It is a snake oil recipe being sold to really stupid people so oligarchs can control the political process.  Called “government by a few people”.
3133 2018-12-03 19:03:10 It's state-owned oil no matter how you look at it I'm glad you're all okay with that. Everyone cheers and applauds but the end result of this won't benefit anyone. Glad to see the Refiner's take it on the chin though. Imperial & Suncor rob us blind. #gasoline
3134 2018-12-03 19:03:10 They got a court ruling that says it's ok for them to lie thru their teeth to you & do what ever the hell they want instead. There are still Superdelegates (just restricted from doing anything till it counts). They are still being bribed with corp./oil&gas/banks/&many more
3135 2018-12-03 19:03:03 Enjoyed the episode. Luke do you see cheaper oil as a headwind to the dollar shortage thesis? Has your view changed in any meaningful way since MV xmas dollar end game last year?
3136 2018-12-03 19:03:01 When you’re ready
3137 2018-12-03 19:02:58 youhad40+yearstogetoffoil or save funds, or create a plan, or make incremental changes, etc...
3138 2018-12-03 19:02:56 1. Oil price goes down, threatening the wealth of investors
2. Canadian emerging market restricts supply
3. Oil price goes up and consumers must pay more at the pumps
4. Investors (the majority US-based) become wealthy off the poor

It's so easy to make money!!
3139 2018-12-03 19:02:44 Hanukkah also about oil(s) and being lit.
3140 2018-12-03 19:02:41 Wait till they start censoring social media, giving grants to MSM and keep your eyes open for convenient, well timed events to support their agenda& slam critics.. Oil leaks, racial clashes, anything to help them out. Hope I’m wrong but would be par for the Liberal course
3141 2018-12-03 19:02:36 Truffle oil is worth the money.
3142 2018-12-03 19:02:34 I can’t believe a new climate report gets released everyday about how much worse it’s getting and yet there’s a “race” to get Alaskan oil. I hate this place
3143 2018-12-03 19:02:32 Big problem, oil marketers giving federal government 7 days ultimatum to pay N800b debt, hmmm sounds like #Asuu is going on strike for a long time
3144 2018-12-03 19:02:26 Oil changes used to be so cheap, fuck happened 
3145 2018-12-03 19:02:25 (2) are we ready to paying more taxes to support the massive levels of unemployment that will occur? And this just another way to attack the oil and gas industry in regards to the PM’s ridiculous carbon tax
3146 2018-12-03 19:02:25 ربنا يستر علينااا 
3147 2018-12-03 19:02:23 Beto takes the most money from the Oil industry out of all the Mainstream Dems.
3148 2018-12-03 19:02:12 What about commodities? Natural gas, oil, gold?
3149 2018-12-03 19:02:05 In all fairness, we're not really selling "oil".  We're selling dilbit.  Or as Ed Stelmach's analogy called it, "topsoil of the farm".
3150 2018-12-03 19:01:44 No matter how rich or how much your parents love you, there's a time you have to give yourself brain and find your way out, you can't continue to live with them forever.

He's a Masterclass

3155 2018-12-03 19:01:25 Why they charge me $50 for a oil change 
3156 2018-12-03 19:01:24 honestly i'm just amused that frankie muniz is now selling olive oil at farmers markets
3157 2018-12-03 19:01:12 Ohhh ...I now need an 'oil burner' in my life to complicate matters

3159 2018-12-03 19:00:59 The U.S. Farm Bill legalizing hemp federally is going to go a long way in the push for full marijuana reform. In the meantime, the bill will make the market extremely friendly for CBD oil. ~ Stephen Karmazyn, Profit Confidential #MondayMotivation #MarijuanaStocks
3160 2018-12-03 19:00:56 Justice refers to a decent life for everyone:  fair wages, affordable groceries and consumer goods, affordable rents and housing prices, no price fixing by big oil and big pharma, no gratuitous tax breaks for corporations who don't need them.

3188 2018-12-03 18:58:07 The focus group that’s made up of former oil patch workers?
3189 2018-12-03 18:58:06 A recession is two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. Considering current GDP growth and improved prospects for oil given curtailment, I don't see it.
3190 2018-12-03 18:58:00 Some of the sanex stuff is good there's one which has oil in which is a bit relieving. wanna douse myself in it
3191 2018-12-03 18:57:57 "So long as it's dependent on oil." There, I finished that for him.
3192 2018-12-03 18:57:54 there where not human rights  activist  but oil well dealers
3193 2018-12-03 18:57:27 If anyone is still looking for a Christmas gift idea, I need an oil change ;)

3195 2018-12-03 18:57:12 Just discovered the joys of homemade sweet/regular potato wedges w/ oregano & olive oil. Honestly, it would be better if didn't get drawn to sweet stuff so easily. It's this time of year onwards when tends to be more sweet stuff shared on sta. Takes lots of willpower to resist.
3196 2018-12-03 18:57:02 Then it turns out that it doesn't need another oil change for 2 years. Still burns fossils though...
3197 2018-12-03 18:56:55 There’s more to the energy industry than oil and gas. Do try to keep up.
3198 2018-12-03 18:56:53 Counting calories does have some benefits. It may be useful on keto for people who are still not getting results. These individuals may be unknowingly consuming too many fats, such as coconut oil, in order to increase ketones.
3199 2018-12-03 18:56:45 Soak in ACV, peppermint and rose absolute EO, honey and grapeseed oil. Thank me later.
3200 2018-12-03 18:56:38 The recent capitulation by governments around the world w.r.t. cutting oil production is exactly what we need to see to end the bear market. The market is always right, there has been too much supply for over a decade hence the price collapse. This is how bull markets are born.
3201 2018-12-03 18:56:22 YO T Boone the Russian Oil supply line is wide open after another Opec member, Qutar, leaves.
3202 2018-12-03 18:56:20 Those of you tree huggers that oppose #keystonexl  & the other pipelines, you need to realize that your everyday life depends and comes from oil in one way or another. Stop listening to the 2 faced celebs an the bullshit.
3203 2018-12-03 18:56:12 What name this oil?
3204 2018-12-03 18:56:07 Try olive oil and a paper towel to make stainless steel appliances look like new. It’s brilliant.
3205 2018-12-03 18:56:06 Add a few drops of olbas oil to a bowl of hot water , towel over your head and steam your head off!!! It works! 
3206 2018-12-03 18:56:05 y’all loved the anti palm oil advert shit but haven’t done ANYTHING about it. nice nutella crepe there ya hypocrite
3207 2018-12-03 18:55:52 Interesting as a Trump strategy (inspired by Vlad) is to cause a little mini-crisis here and there so the oil price rises (that is what floats Russia's economy) and the three people driving oil price are Vlad/Trump/MBS - saudi
3208 2018-12-03 18:55:47 Dunno. Try coconut oil....
3209 2018-12-03 18:55:44 Have a hard time with just about any social situation. And well I got myself an oil pen to ease the mind at work and in public
3210 2018-12-03 18:55:40 OPEC should not cut production.  Oil has been an oasis for many desert nations and has fuelled an ultrauxury lifestyle for many sheikhs.  Let them walk on earth now!
3211 2018-12-03 18:55:34 To blame the Premier for Canada Select oil prices is just stupid. So I guess everyone's okay with state-owned oil.... I'll have to remember that.
3212 2018-12-03 18:55:32 If we assume climate change is real & do something about it, there are 2 outcomes. 1. Climate change turned out to be real, so we stand a chance of stopping it, mitigating or reversing 2. climate change doesn't happen, but it means the geopolitics of oil is removed from conflicts
3213 2018-12-03 18:55:28 Ahora subió el gas oil??
3214 2018-12-03 18:55:25 The main issue is the feds are making the regulatory process impossible to build new pipelines which is why TransCanada cancelled energy east. Irving has no choice but to import their oil. Bill C-69 will be the nail in the coffin.
3215 2018-12-03 18:55:17 guys that go to shops to get their oil changed freak me out
3216 2018-12-03 18:55:12 I don't know if I could sell them on the idea of with my olive oil couscous cake...
3217 2018-12-03 18:55:08 Correct me if im wrong but oil is organic matter broken down over extended time. I wonder if that's why we store our dead in concrete easier access for future need. I know creep thought but it's bothered me why we don't return nature back to nature.
3218 2018-12-03 18:54:52 IOWs, Big Oil was covered in the Cruz/O'Rouke race
3219 2018-12-03 18:54:50 Of course they do, and even 'organic' doesn't necessarily mean that it's actually healthy. You honestly have to read all of your ingredients labels and read between the lines to make sure you are actually getting what you want over some smoke and mirrors snake oil 
3220 2018-12-03 18:54:49 @PowerLunch @MelissaLeeCNBC @BillGriffeth @TheDomino Isn't US #oil #wti @US_OGA "effectively" dumping oil, as #China dumps steel!? Why do US pump so much that their profits&stock prices actually drop, idiots. Can't keep mkt share in oil, within grade,one bucket is same as another
3221 2018-12-03 18:54:48 I’m so goddamn mad that oil companies have known climate change is real for decades and did everything to stop people from acting on it. I want to burn their offices down. I want to throw their CEOs into a fucking pit.
3222 2018-12-03 18:54:41 Chag urim sameach! May we never be afraid to stand up for what’s right and may we never run out of oil, for a little light goes a long way!
3223 2018-12-03 18:54:05 We use oil. My grandmother used schmaltz
3224 2018-12-03 18:54:05 CBD OIL anyone who’s interested in information about this follow me & I will follow back & can DM you information about it .
3225 2018-12-03 18:53:58 Finally getting my oil changed in my car today.
3226 2018-12-03 18:53:57 Does oil go with interest rates higher again?
3227 2018-12-03 18:53:51 Currently soaking in a hot bubble bath that I added jojoba oil to  thinking I might bake something after.. trying to make the most out of my one day off
3228 2018-12-03 18:53:41 Definitely not that make up remover. Baby oil gel and a dab of Vaseline together will have you exploding with ecstasy.

3230 2018-12-03 18:53:39 Petrol prices fluctuate heavily on the price of international crude oil. All this while when the international oil price was high, the prices were high here in USA too. Then I had replied to a few pro-Congressi tweeples to stop spreading propaganda and they abused me back!
3231 2018-12-03 18:53:37 Fourth year co-op report at @AAFC_Canada turned into Agron. J. publication! "Niger (Guizotia abyssinica.) Response to Nitrogen and Seeding depth in the Northern Great Plains" Niger is emerging oil seed in Canada and this is one of the first studies investigating it. Open access
3232 2018-12-03 18:53:29 Qatar oil production has a tiny afflicts on OPEC, then why is Qatar leaving? Just to getred of OPEC control ,so it can save Iran from sanctions by selling the Iranian oil under qatar name..
3233 2018-12-03 18:53:24 It will still be sold out. The boy get better oil for head.
3234 2018-12-03 18:53:21 How come there is no oil today
3235 2018-12-03 18:53:15 No Liverpool don't. Won 5 European Cups without Cheating & always kept their best players. Suarez the only one sold as their best player. Whereas the likes of Man City could never keep their best players, 130 years of selling. These mercenaries will be gone as quick as the oil

between Crown PrinceMBS, Saudi Arabia & PM Modi ji has led bigots to denigrate them. MBS allegedly ordered Kashoggi's kill. Lord Palmerstone once said "Nations have no permanent allies, they only have permanent interests.
India needs oil; MBS international resurgence.
3238 2018-12-03 18:52:55 Then why did he support Paris Agreement? Plus wants to give illegal border crossers fast path to Canadian citizenship. All politicians want oil to tidewater and stop Saudi oil except Trudeau and his sidekick Butts.
3239 2018-12-03 18:52:53 Toss in oil too. Both are very cool
3240 2018-12-03 18:52:51 Yeah it’s made with good fats some of them make it with olive oil only downfall of mayo is high sodium
3241 2018-12-03 18:52:50 I need an oil change im so stressed out
3242 2018-12-03 18:52:50 Where are the infrastructure(mobile refineries etc) and quality education? I can assure you that none was done by Buhari.

Buhari only paid off militants, renewed their contracts and allowed them to embark on unrestrained oil bunkering.

When does Oil Fall 3 drop? Eager for it.
3247 2018-12-03 18:52:01 Unfortunately the UN became a gang of dictators and post communist or communist countries, in which Europe is welcome as long as this declining continent needs cheap oil and is afraid of Muslim terrorism. The UN are a nuisance which must be reformed ASAP.

3249 2018-12-03 18:51:55 OK I need help here.  Can anyone imagine a scenario where the oil industry is backed down and "what?"  will heat our homes in the winter?  Also, "what?" will all the oil workers do for an income?  How will this play out?  It has to, but I need some invisioning here.  Please help.
3250 2018-12-03 18:51:46 I have worked my entire life in the Oil and Gas industry doing industrial construction. I have two daughters that have done the same. My daughters have worked on some of the biggest projects in Canada and have stayed in remote campsites. I have never worried for their safety.

3252 2018-12-03 18:51:35 RAW SEWAGE ?
OIL LIKE SUBSTANCE ?
LARD LIKE FATTY DEPOSITS ?
Something doesn’t sit right with these descriptions of what a lorry spilled on to the A1231 last week
I passed on Saturday while cleaning was underway and it affected my breathing
We have aright to know WHAT THIS WAS
3253 2018-12-03 18:51:34 I decided to use a Shichimi Togarashi blend of seasonings (red pepper, Sichuan, ginger, black+white sesame seeds, orange peel, and nori), minced garlic, sesame oil, tamari, rice vinegar, scallions, and some water as a marinade.
3254 2018-12-03 18:51:33 why did my local dispensaries have to get raided ya girl needs some damn cbd/thc oil for her chronic pain but i have no fucking clue where to go anymore and i sure as hell wouldn’t trust the online government products after the shitty mouldy bug filled weed they sold to people
3255 2018-12-03 18:50:49 While Canada cuts 350 and Russia 150.... the balance to the 550 of unsold oil is marginal. Again, i am not so sure the next Opec meeting will give a production cut. It's more likely a reshuffle of the quotas to rebalance Iran's glut.
3256 2018-12-03 18:50:45 Data is the new oil + as government organizations we all need a data breach response plan - great insight!  #digital #change #ELPDigi #whatcouldgowrong
3257 2018-12-03 18:50:36 I thought the sticker on my car said to get an oil change at 17,000 

It actually said 11,700 

My current mileage is at 14,000 

Super casual
3258 2018-12-03 18:50:26 The West is dependent on an ever-increasing supply of energy. The demand for oil is actually the demand for energy. Governments that restrict oil-provided energy lower the cost of oil for those who do not restrict it, and those countries get more and cheaper energy.
3259 2018-12-03 18:50:21 They aren't protesting Accords or globalism. They're protesting because oil prices are falling globally, & they think gas prices are falling globally (not true) & they think their president is behind high gas prices.  Some of them are Nazi sympathizers. Nothing to celebrate here.
3260 2018-12-03 18:50:20 Now that petro-provinces and the oil industry are making the link between pipelines and oil output, this argument to #KeepItInTheGround is even more convincing.
3261 2018-12-03 18:50:11 @tasty what oil do you use for frying?
3262 2018-12-03 18:49:58 mf needs to deep condition, use a hair mask and sleek it down w oil wtf
3263 2018-12-03 18:49:43 Here's a thought... stop extracting oil.
3264 2018-12-03 18:49:38 Oil that bish up!
3265 2018-12-03 18:49:37 Getting hot oil spilled on your hand is almost like dumping it straight into a pot of boiling water
3266 2018-12-03 18:49:37 Someone once told me when they think of me, the smell tea tree oil and weed and honestly I fuck w the aesthetic
3267 2018-12-03 18:49:26 eDonDeyMadt abi?
Na why she dey use groundout oil dey garri!

Na SauceKid talk am o no be me
3268 2018-12-03 18:49:20 Ok, the Federal government can help alleviate future issues like this by allowing pipelines to be constructed and get the flow of oil/gas to markets that will pay what the product(s) are worth.
3269 2018-12-03 18:49:17 Days before an OPEC-led meeting aimed at tackling a recent slide in oil prices, Qatar, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' (OPEC) smallest oil producer and also the world's biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter, has annou...
3270 2018-12-03 18:49:17 Why do you think so?
3271 2018-12-03 18:49:14 started oil cleansing again and my skin is grateful for it.
3272 2018-12-03 18:49:05 Believe that top salary for doctor is about $34-40 a month. That's it. Loads were sent to Venezuela in return for cheap oil but a lot are not properly qualified; others have fled Venezuela for Colombia. I wonder why. No accompanying families allowed.
3273 2018-12-03 18:49:05 The difference in my blood pressure because of it and the lavender oil is noticeable
3274 2018-12-03 18:49:03 みんながそうやって炒められて揚げられて…ねぇ、誰のおかげ?誰のおかげかな?

＼It's OIL!!!／
3275 2018-12-03 18:48:47 Careful, you might end up with a swarm of CyberNats telling you about how Aberdeen Oil would ensure the Scottish PetroState will be the greatest thing since sliced bread.
3276 2018-12-03 18:48:44 Packet first. Then frozen or canned mixed vegetables, Then throw away the over-salty "broth" and drizzle on some sesame oil and sesame seeds or other good stuff on the drained noodles and vegetables.
3277 2018-12-03 18:48:36 So argon oil works well when you trying to remove nail glue when two nieces get their fingers stuck together.

3283 2018-12-03 18:48:11 "negligent"? nah, when you're operating a multi-BILLION dollar enterprise, nothing like this is left to chance. They do a cost/benefit analysis on the popcorn oil! This is by design. Do nothing or as little as possible. React to the winds of public opinion
3284 2018-12-03 18:48:01 Stop HARRP" weather"manipulation. stop listining to NWO Attenborough,a mass depopulation Guru.
Question why is the Oil industry not mentioned.
Trillions of tons of oil used not a "jot"spoken or said.
Macron is Illuminati
3285 2018-12-03 18:47:55 i’m sad my size for the oil colored combats are gone

3287 2018-12-03 18:47:29 Scheer is against carbon taxes, wants to get oil to tide water, wants to stop the buying of Saudi oil, wants to shut down illegal border crossers.  You think those things are “for” UN globalization?
3288 2018-12-03 18:47:28 Its the solar panel conglomerates funding all of these climate change studies. How can big oil corporations ever compete?
3289 2018-12-03 18:47:27 remember last week when we played real-life monopoly and went bankrupt after like 1 rent payment and a chance card for an oil change
3290 2018-12-03 18:47:15 Bhai @KVBohra Kya ky karega chachai banne ke chakkar me

3291 2018-12-03 18:47:04 @hereandnow @npr
With the price of a barrel of oil going down after the murder of Khasshogi, the resulting outrage and SA PR media blitz to counter bad publicity, we can presume the oil market is not "fluid", but is in actuality, capricious. We are being bribed to look askance.
3292 2018-12-03 18:47:00 They're for more oil expansion was my point. 

But yes they should be "for" or "against" certain things. Their #1 goal as a host of a new org should be to promote truth. And the truth is oil pipeline expansion in 2018 is pure insanity.
3293 2018-12-03 18:46:58 A)not talking replacemnt, talking multipolarity b) long history of surplus areas providing global liquidity via capital account c) impact more likely regional (RU, mb IR) and d) EUR invoicing of oil really good for Turkey actually given its export and remittance structure.
3294 2018-12-03 18:46:57 Was it CBD & THC oil you tried as Ive read #ChronicPain sufferers definitely need THC too for the pain?
3295 2018-12-03 18:46:48 Where is the electric going to come from? Tree huggers ruined our perfectly safe nuclear plants... and don’t say something as dumb as (solar panels) without considering the snow (which creates need for even more heat). Also, WE ALREADY HAVE THE OIL HERE! We just need to SELL it!!
3296 2018-12-03 18:46:44 Thank you Ms. Notley, I am sure some multinationals will not agree with your production cuts, but I am in full support of your decision. Hopefully Ottawa will listen and do all it can to help Alberta oil reach Eastern Canada.
3297 2018-12-03 18:46:43 I need to get a new fuel pump, new tires and new windshield for my car why can’t I ever just need my oil changed and that’s it 
3298 2018-12-03 18:46:37 I'm using @farmerkaney rapeseed oil
3299 2018-12-03 18:46:33 And the fact also remains that the oil industry is sunsetting amid a global glut of oil. Competent governments and industries realize it, which is why the international majors are planning for the post-fossil fuel era - and so is Saudi Arabia.
3300 2018-12-03 18:46:25 I just LOVE listening to them talk about #OIL on Pumps R Us @CNBC ... not a one of em was calling for sub 70 2 months ago....let alone 60, 50, or a 40 handle ... they remind me of the pollsters a night before a scam election.... 
3301 2018-12-03 18:46:12 Oh so it's @POTUS and oil prices that are at fault......not the oppressed people of France fighting for their country and rights against macron. Yeah, nah.
3302 2018-12-03 18:46:11 It's all a sham. You are in on it with the liberals. Shut down the oil sands in Alberta. Your plan is working. Just be honest for once.
3303 2018-12-03 18:46:09 @BarackObama I heard you on C-span bragging about "that was me, people" in terms of increasing America's oil and gas production. Shameful. Do you keep up with the science on climate change? What happened to you?
3304 2018-12-03 18:46:00 Is there oil in France tho?
3305 2018-12-03 18:45:58 Bring oil
3306 2018-12-03 18:45:55 These oil corporations can’t survive on their own. It was their poor management that lead to this situation.

The free market has spoken!

3320 2018-12-03 18:44:20 Hi @CoughdropD - COD stands for "cash on delivery." With COD there are no service plans or emergency numbers to call. At Slomin's, we provide you with a locked in rate so won't pay the over inflated prices during the cold winter months. Please call 1-866-OIL-DEAL for more info!
3321 2018-12-03 18:44:11 Hanukkah is not a Zionist holiday. The Jewish religious holiday of Hanukkah lasts eight days to remember, and celebrate, the miracle of the one cruse of oil lasting eight days. Zionists hijacked the holiday just as they'd hijacked Palestine!
3322 2018-12-03 18:43:59 @wolf_trap also watching oil and gold closely for possible new uptrends
3323 2018-12-03 18:43:55 Yes. In the last 20 years, OPEC has not really favored the smaller oil producers who can't match the volumes of Saudi and Russia.

They are thinking ahead and focusing their energies on where they have competitive advantage & less likelihood of obsolescence - gas. Smart move.
3324 2018-12-03 18:43:52 @MelissaLeeCNBC Melissa, Qatar doesn't produce Oil. It produces Nat Gas only. So OPEC not relevant to them as there is no price correlation of oil to Nat Gas
3325 2018-12-03 18:43:49 Supposedly tea tree oil works well...
If you use salt water you have to make sure that you use the right ratio of salt to hot water or it’ll make it worse (that happened to my nose like twice)
3326 2018-12-03 18:43:48 My man is being super salty because I asked someone else to change my cars oil instead of him 
3327 2018-12-03 18:43:45 Then I stick with my answer of Olive Oil
3328 2018-12-03 18:43:44 ExxonMobil is going to drill oil in Pakistan why can't Trump Group and other US brands invest in Pakistan and grow their business??? And make money!!!
3329 2018-12-03 18:43:43 Indonesia menempati peringkat 1 dalam produk pertanian,
yaitu : cengkeh (cloves) & pala (nutmeg), serta no.2 dalam karet
alam (Natural Rubber) dan minyak sawit mentah (Crude Palm Oil).
3330 2018-12-03 18:43:42 I got to that point a few months ago and started using cbd oil and it’s seeming to work well.
3331 2018-12-03 18:43:42 I don't agree. KSA doesn't have to push their product on every nation. They and Russia can back off a bit. Let USA fulfill their own production needs for a while. We shouldn't be attacked for trying to supply ourselves with our own oil.
3332 2018-12-03 18:43:35 I have to go get my car washed after my oil change  it’s bad
3333 2018-12-03 18:43:30 Do you love oil as much as you hate LGBT+ and women’s rights?
3334 2018-12-03 18:43:26 My small mistake was unintentional. Yet, it coulda set the whole parking garage on fire. And ruin lots of cars nearby. From a small drop of oil. Only a second. I Thank God for controlling the situation during times of panic. We are truly blessed.
3335 2018-12-03 18:43:21 okay. fuck palm oil.
3336 2018-12-03 18:43:18 Why did I just put olive oil on olives
3337 2018-12-03 18:43:10 .@hasanminhaj As you seem to like understanding things fully, you should learn more about Bitcoin's political/social aspects. In the same show you mention "no one goes into oil to find themselves" & you bash BTC price. Humor of course, but the irony is deeper than you think. 
3338 2018-12-03 18:43:07 Just had my van serviced and tested. Get it done every 2 years. All they did was the oil and filter. Missed cabin,air and fuel filter. Had a look at previous service 2 years before and they didn’t do it then! Hadn’t been done for 4 years. Did it myself. Needs new brake pads also.
3339 2018-12-03 18:43:04 I’ll never ever understand why ppl never do their oil changes and think their car will run for ever like that.
3340 2018-12-03 18:43:00 Especially as oil is set to take a nose dive .
3341 2018-12-03 18:42:56 Climate change is running faster than we are, we have to match the pace and exceed its pace. We have to pay attention to the vast environmental damage of oil spills in the Niger Delta. This is one of my agenda’s in my first 100 days as Governer of Rivers.
3342 2018-12-03 18:42:46 That extra virgin olive oil be hittin different
3343 2018-12-03 18:42:45 With how many girls have me change their oil I should start charging lmao
3344 2018-12-03 18:42:40 Y'all: "Its Blake Xiao Long"

Y'all: "Its Yang Belladonna"

3345 2018-12-03 18:42:40 Days before an OPEC-led meeting aimed at tackling a recent slide in oil prices, Qatar, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' (OPEC) smallest oil producer and also the world's biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter, has annou...
3346 2018-12-03 18:42:37 This is just a collective PSA to those of y’all who I graduated high school with, who had kids right after: 
I am not interested in becoming part of your essential oil pyramid scheme. Thank you & please don’t come again.
3347 2018-12-03 18:42:27 I’m gonna check with Al D. And see if I can get the name of the OLd Old Russian hand job lady. I wonder if she checked his oil ?
3348 2018-12-03 18:42:27 Don't get me started on the cannabis "routing" products that break down in 15 minutes. I am using syringe oil to avoid using any apparatus.
3349 2018-12-03 18:42:22 "They're just churning in their oil."
3350 2018-12-03 18:42:15 Diamond withdrawal from Obke opens the door to Iran to break US sanctions, Qatar corridor of Iran's oil ,,,, exposed to game.
3351 2018-12-03 18:42:15 this looks kinda nice even when the NYIOOC world olive oil on toast is weird
3352 2018-12-03 18:42:11 How in the name of god do we continue to justify those oil refineries remaining right in the middle of the valley
3353 2018-12-03 18:42:07 Ale to prawda. Żydowski Manhattan Chase Bank  finansował NSDAP. Firma żyda Rockefellera, Standard Oil prowadziła interesy z firmą IG Farben, która produkowała Zyklon B. Oczywiście to byli "amerykańscy" Żydzi.
3354 2018-12-03 18:42:01 First, you must look at yourself in the mirror.
What made him move to those imperialists, racist countries, invading and stealing countries.
He was a car thief but they are oil, gold nd land thieves. Ugly truth.
3355 2018-12-03 18:41:53 On a day of 'Qatarstrophe' for #OPEC, oil benchmarks providing comfort following bullish Saudi, Russian soundbites & easing of US-China tensions: #WTI at $52.72/bbl (+3.51%), #Brent at $61.27/bbl (+3.04%) #OOTT #oilandgas
3356 2018-12-03 18:41:49 lol, wounded by Ottawa??? No wounded by their own stupidity.
Decades ago they had the chance to supply all the oil for Canada, they refused because they wanted to sell only to the US and have been complaining about it ever since.
All their problems they created themselves.
3357 2018-12-03 18:41:32 Na oil money be that oh  may God grant your wish! As you have said, the universe will work in your favor!
3358 2018-12-03 18:41:19 Did you also not know that that includes individuals who gave a cumulative amount of 200 who work in the oil and gas industry and that the oil and gas industry is one of the largest employers in the state?
3359 2018-12-03 18:41:08 Logged off at #69. I'll be back online in 90 minutes for oil & cum at rank #59. All offline tips help! Thank u bbs for everything so far. So happy
3360 2018-12-03 18:41:08 we used to make bird feeders with seed and lard or something, some kind of bird friendly fats.  Kept the squirrels away too.  

If you have a feeder on a pole, be sure to oil or butter the pole to keep rodents away from your bird food.
3361 2018-12-03 18:41:07 The U.S. is likely the #1 oil producer, now. As we know, that wields global power! Now, to use that power and profit to create alternate, renewable fuel.
3362 2018-12-03 18:40:58 Potek na packaging yan, akala ko lip tint essential oil pala AHHAJAJAJAHHSHSHSHSHAHAHAHAHAHA
3363 2018-12-03 18:40:52 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
3364 2018-12-03 18:40:52 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
3365 2018-12-03 18:40:44 Someone get her the hemp oil dog treats so she can slonk with us
3366 2018-12-03 18:40:41 I never knew how important cuticle oil was until this past week
3367 2018-12-03 18:40:32 Well since I have been here we went through the BP oil spill hurricane Irma and now this red tide I can’t believe the one in the 90s that you speak of lasted three years that’s disheartening
3368 2018-12-03 18:40:24 China offered same package to Venezuela. Today’s oil production and reserves belong to China.
3369 2018-12-03 18:40:23 すっかりバルカロールも寒くなったなー。へくしっ
3370 2018-12-03 18:40:16 So what else is new with this narcissist. He takes credit for the economy, now for the oil production and next I expect him to take credit for the deals President Trump has made with Mexico & Canada. He will claim he set them up for him! LOL "He is a loser"
3371 2018-12-03 18:40:16 Sometimes I wonder if ozil oil was English they'll like him or make a sterling out of him but then again they dnot encourage flair and genius so they can "NEVER" have an ozil
3372 2018-12-03 18:40:09 This thing smells like straight up mustard oil
3373 2018-12-03 18:40:05 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。
3374 2018-12-03 18:40:02 This demonstrates that Alberta is clearly unstable at the moment, which thanks to the NDP/Liberal alliance of only supporting terrorism backed oil, is sadly true.
3375 2018-12-03 18:40:02 everybody knows that when the Donald talks the 'truth', a butterly writes a song about #love
3376 2018-12-03 18:39:53 Oil literally hurts my feelings every single day because he could care less if I come home and only greets his other mom’s 
3377 2018-12-03 18:39:40 I'm tellin' ya fella, fake bacon is as near as dammit with a brush of oil and a sprinkle of paprika/garlic under the grill!

But top marks on your self control...
3378 2018-12-03 18:39:35 Seriously now, we're already calling the guys catfish..
3379 2018-12-03 18:39:31 lol you’re welcome. I only use Jamaican Castor oil.
3380 2018-12-03 18:38:54 I use garnier fructis tho.... green bottle for strength. And I deep condition once a month. And argan oil for a lil sheen and anti frizz
3381 2018-12-03 18:38:46 Diamond withdrawal from Obke opens the door to Iran to break US sanctions, Qatar corridor of Iran's oil ,,,, exposed to game.
3382 2018-12-03 18:38:45 Wait, a covert lobbyist for oil exploration (aka a Republican) praises the work of The Fake Geologist (as a 'force for good' no less)? What are the odds?
3383 2018-12-03 18:38:42 @jkenney The oil in Alberta belongs  to all Canadians.
3384 2018-12-03 18:38:30 Less awesome that they don't have a single host that is against oil pipeline expansion.
3385 2018-12-03 18:38:16 The oil market is fluid
3386 2018-12-03 18:38:08 Its oil, people inject oil into themselves when it looks like that lol
3387 2018-12-03 18:38:05 I cannot grasp how there are morons who believe this nonsense. 
The vaccination-causes-autism theory was debunked (and the doctor had his license removed for faking the report). All this “curable” bullshit stems from NO ACTUAL SCIENCE. 

Snake oil salesmen suck.
3388 2018-12-03 18:38:03 Her biggest mistake was hiring anti oil people to run the industry.
3389 2018-12-03 18:38:00 The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.  He maketh me lie down in green pastures.  He anoiteth my head with oil, for His name's sake.  He leadeth me beside still waters.  He preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies.  He restoreth my soul.  Yea, though I walk..
3390 2018-12-03 18:37:58 Is this the same fella that said oil was all but ran out?
3391 2018-12-03 18:37:54 She say she don’t need a man for nothing but her tire pressure and oil light on..... das cap 
3392 2018-12-03 18:37:53 Exfoliate twice a week, and putting tea tree oil diluted with water on your face as a mist is great if you have more oily than dry skin and you should moisturize with pure aloe!!!
3393 2018-12-03 18:37:44 Springsteen claims we are the ones drinking the snake oil. Mind boggling how they think we are ones that are delusional.
3394 2018-12-03 18:37:40 That definition from the article.

Oil changes are useful. They may be difficult and not pay well (although I know a mechanics that does well for himself), but they’re not bullshit. If the mechanics disappeared tomorrow, we’d all feel shit out of luck.
3395 2018-12-03 18:37:39 Current emotional craving: beef pho. With EXTRA tendon. A good hit of fish sauce. Just a spritz of line. And a side of the green onion in oil 
3396 2018-12-03 18:37:29 Never let food, especially meats to be entirely ready when taking photographs. Or either oil/marinate
3397 2018-12-03 18:37:25 Because money is king
Alaska being destroyed daily in the hunt for gold
The sea beds being destroyed in the hunt for gold
Forest being cut down to make palm oil plantations
Only Iceland shops banning palm oil in their own products
Humans the biggest problem for this planet
Greed
3398 2018-12-03 18:37:16 I’ve been looking for a gift for my mom for 5 days and the only thing I’ve found is a $60 bottle of olive oil
3399 2018-12-03 18:37:15 'action'
3400 2018-12-03 18:37:05 Chevy in Rockville a little slow man. Second time it’s take over 4 hours to get my car back from an oil change
3401 2018-12-03 18:37:02 The flippant way JT announces these give always of taxpayers money is revolting. It’s not his money! And you,Gerald, should be jailed for treason because of your desire to shut down the oil and gas business through influencing your butt buddy. Disgusting government and leader
3402 2018-12-03 18:36:55 The oil & gas market is looking interesting. Qatar to pull out from OPEC by January. Obviously there are deals that are happening underground. Maybe another cartel formed to rival OPEC. Will this end up good for the buyers or will it be two big cartels choosing whom to sell to?
3403 2018-12-03 18:36:55 will be dictating our immigration laws 

Alberta is decreasing oil production 

Signed the terrible USMCA

Insulted Canadians on the world stage

Pushing the sham Carbon HST tax 

plus more,

This is only since Nov 1st.  We still have a month to go
3404 2018-12-03 18:36:55 you're most likely correct there. #Oil  will rally perhaps a couple of dollars more, where #natty  may or may not slide, but eventually #ruble may stay elevated for a while. Particularly as warm winds of politics are there these days.
3405 2018-12-03 18:36:51 I see @cenovus reprising Occidental Petroleum when Armand Hammer was in charge of it. Happy to do biz with the Moscow Politburo. Well, I accuse Cenovus and the other oil companies happy to agree with @RachelNotley of being price gougers. #abpoli #oilprice @purpleline
3406 2018-12-03 18:36:47 you a real one KD! beyond real thank you im gonna go to the beauty supply store now, any kind of castor oil?
3407 2018-12-03 18:36:26 ALberta needs a plan B and move away from oil as there is a glut and its going the way of the do do bird in times coming
3408 2018-12-03 18:36:23 i honestly don’t miss my oil hauls. come take!! 
i must retire love 
3409 2018-12-03 18:36:18 A restoring facial mask, sultry blue, with grapeskin, neem oil, and exfoliating diamond dust. It comes as an insoluble gel.
3410 2018-12-03 18:36:16 あくまで個人の見解だけどテキストの内容が厳密に正しいかを疑った際、具体例を持ってそれを再現して一般論の感覚をつかむ人は理論向いてる(力学や電磁気のdouble sumとか)
3411 2018-12-03 18:36:14 I’ve succumbed to taking Cod liver oil capsules #OldTwat
3412 2018-12-03 18:36:11 Lmaoo put some coconut oil on them thangs
3413 2018-12-03 18:36:00 So the oil and gas projects going over-budget and competition by electric cars will doom the oil and gas industry? 

Why do EY produce such shallow analysis without any meaningful arguments?
3414 2018-12-03 18:35:59 Burning oil at this time. Fresh and full of idea 
3415 2018-12-03 18:35:57 Hopefully he actually wants to sing for us. Just make sure to oil and clean up the circuit boards. Or find a new one and do it again to that one.
3416 2018-12-03 18:35:57 Make sure you hold them to account at LAC reviews. The squeaky wheel gets the oil/stops LA backsliding.

And the inevitable recommendation of supervised contact needs to be challenged. Good luck! You are in my thoughts and prayers, FWIW.
3417 2018-12-03 18:35:56 I lose my edges every time I wear wigs. Castor oil & REAL silk scarves grow it back in like 2 weeks.
3418 2018-12-03 18:35:54 You and your @GOP enablers are oil & gas stoogies, and planetary vandals.
3419 2018-12-03 18:35:47 What's your favorite brand of oil Chloe? I'm going to buy stock in it.
3420 2018-12-03 18:35:47 Para! De la nafta pero un aumento del gas oil
3421 2018-12-03 18:35:46 Again. There is only political pandering to a belief that pipelines will help the industry. That belief is wrong. Don't believe political pandering. Demand for Alberta oil is In a nosedive because there are cleaner, cheaper, competitors and more daily. Alberta diversify
3422 2018-12-03 18:35:29 And trump wants to dig. More oil
3423 2018-12-03 18:35:18 He's a traitor. Everything was for the oil and for his family and friends to become more rich.
3424 2018-12-03 18:35:18 What happened to the oil they found in Jamaica?
3425 2018-12-03 18:35:04 Apni naf mai oil lagao ya pawun ke talway par oil ki karo InshAllah sar  dard khbi ni ho ga.bhai Allah tuje sehat da
3426 2018-12-03 18:35:04 If the world keeps warming up we eventually  won't need coal or oil..
3427 2018-12-03 18:35:02 The kids out west think differently, they get a lot kids that could easily play at larger schools they don't have fbs are bust mentality like they do down here. Another reason for their success is a lot of money North Dakota has oil money.
3428 2018-12-03 18:34:56 #fact
3429 2018-12-03 18:34:53 Here at the Gurn we've read on facebook the suggestion that this is contained in the latest Cromarty Firth Port newsletter "Due to higher priority projects the Port will not be pursuing the re-submission of our ship to ship at anchor application." S2S oil transfers plan no more!
3430 2018-12-03 18:34:49 Most significant political events usually appear to be caused by something relatively irrelevant. This is because what's lurking beneath the surface will take any excuse to explode. Keep this in mind with France having full on riot over 'just' oil prices.
3431 2018-12-03 18:34:39 I keep pointing out that a basic problem for Tar Sands is: there's plenty of cheaper, higher-quality oil.
To compete, the dilbit must sell cheap enough, that spread between cost & price of refined product is enough to make much more complex refineries profitable. (Plus $hipping.)
3432 2018-12-03 18:34:35 Leadership my sister!!!!! Imagine tapping an unused engine oil that isn't near its expiration date. The glow sis! The damn glow!
3433 2018-12-03 18:34:35 To be fair, they also havent fallen as much. Stocks like Trican and Step have $11 oil and $0.50 AECO priced into them for Q4 and Q1. I think improvement in differentials will at least allow customers to keep much of their planned status quos.
3434 2018-12-03 18:34:24 U.S. stocks were soaring higher this morning after President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to hold off on new tariffs. The S&P 500's best week in seven years. Oil surged 5 %
3435 2018-12-03 18:34:23 Happy birthday Sir. May the oil of God on your head never run dry. May your efforts on GPPA be rewarded, may your generation call you blessed, may the wisdom of God continue to fill your life and may you live to celebrate many beautiful and fruitful years ahead.
3436 2018-12-03 18:34:18 Can u do it fr me
3437 2018-12-03 18:34:14 Baby oil, some menthols, baby wipes annnnnddd .... a Twix?
3438 2018-12-03 18:34:11 That guy no get any burnt oil as a priest.
Thank God say man no be God ooo!
3439 2018-12-03 18:34:07 The modern equivalent of Hanukkah would be if all the oil drained from your car and it kept running for eight days.
3440 2018-12-03 18:34:04 Love that you dont use palm oil = awesome 
3441 2018-12-03 18:34:03 Today in RDR2 is actually a bit naff news

I did the steal the oil wagon mission, the horses Austin powers’d themselves in a narrow creek, as I’m turning them around one falls over a small rock and dies in 3 seconds, mission failed.
3442 2018-12-03 18:34:02 It’s a hair spa kinda day.

Coconut oil, castor oil and a few drops of Argan oil. Massage it in, tie your hair in a bun, leave it in overnight. Enjoy soft and luscious hair tomorrow.

You’re welcome.

3444 2018-12-03 18:33:54 DOES MY SASSYNESS UPSET YOU? ARE YOU BESET WITH GLOOM? CUZ I WALK LIKE I GOT OIL WELLS PUMPIN IN MY LIVING ROOM
3445 2018-12-03 18:33:50 The Notley-Kenney plan to destroy Alberta’s free market for energy is going to cause thousands of men & women in the oil & gas industry to lose their jobs. I’m disgusted. #ABLeg
3446 2018-12-03 18:33:48 I think growing up with a single mom was actually a good thing, because she had to play both rolls I learned a lot of things most girls who had a father didn't. 
I can make a mean shrimp alfredo, but I can also change a tire and check my oil.
3447 2018-12-03 18:33:42 Just scheduled my oil change by phone like a damn adult
3448 2018-12-03 18:33:39 I have an EOT in chemistry tomorrow with these topics:
- Energetics
- Rates of reaction
- Reversible reactions and equilibria
- Organic Chemistry
- Crude Oil
- Alkanes
- Alkenes
- Synthetic polymers
You know how many chapters I've studied?? 2 that's right! FUCKING 2
3449 2018-12-03 18:33:37 Hopefully, Alberta will reduce the flow of oil to BC and PQ
3450 2018-12-03 18:33:32 So good to hear those Saudi ships are so special. Saudi oil lover!
3451 2018-12-03 18:33:23 Aromatherapy

“Eucalyptus oil behind my ear helps with my cell phone battery.”

3452 2018-12-03 18:33:16 A given individual may certainly look at their job as bullshit, but I'll bet the tasks they are supposed to perform are of value to the company. Ex. A guy with a Masters in Marketing doing oil changes at FastLube. To him it's a bullshit job.
3453 2018-12-03 18:33:05 @Matt_Allwright fondue went out of favour when everyone was told to stop eating fried food, melted cheese...plus, what do you do with oil afterwards...and it stinks your house out 
3454 2018-12-03 18:32:51 As a fellow oil wife I know how this lady is feeling and thinking. I also live in a rural oilfield area. So let me say this. These men are most often good men. When I need to change a tire on the side of the hwy they are the first to stop and help or if you have a fire in your
3455 2018-12-03 18:32:46 Let’s get this 

1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast

2-1/4 cups warm water (110° to 115°)

3 tablespoons sugar

1 tablespoon salt

2 tablespoons canola oil

6-1/4 to 6-3/4 cups all-purpose flour

3456 2018-12-03 18:32:35 We needed that video tho  RT @whoadiebrees: craziest video ever RT @TrapGawdd: my life ain’t been the same since i seen that motor oil on them pancakes
3457 2018-12-03 18:32:28 @AmandaLang  Enjoy your report on East-West pipelines needed and the import of 800,000 thousand barrels of Saudi Oil per day on the East Coast.
Maybe @RachelNotley should be asking Trudeau why Alberta can't send oil back East via Canada's 2 railways!
3458 2018-12-03 18:32:22 Took my car to get an oil change and the maintenance light is STILL on wtffff

3460 2018-12-03 18:32:10 Things to watch for: Qatar left OPEC, Russia has a new alliance with the Saudis. This will fundamentally shift the geopolitical order going forward.

Canada & Russia agree to halt production. Oil futures spike on news, weakening dollar.
3461 2018-12-03 18:32:10 Just had a gorgeous hot oil bath with candles. Now time for some gentle yoga to further relax my muscles
3462 2018-12-03 18:31:55 Yes and only here can you get your snake oil to prevent it for happening. Ask yourself what about the magnetic field around the earth that is failing since 2011
3463 2018-12-03 18:31:55 You need your own refineries.
3464 2018-12-03 18:31:50 PTO no longer means Paid Time Off. It means work a half day from home in basketball shorts one day and work while getting your oil changed the other.
3465 2018-12-03 18:31:48 Are you sure that you just haven't joined the Cult?

Maybe you've burned too much Midnight Oil, or consumed too much XTC
3466 2018-12-03 18:31:33 I mixed them in a bag with salt oil and honey then poured into roasting  dish but should have covered them as had to keep turning them to stop burning.  Nice tho 
3467 2018-12-03 18:31:26 how do i politely tell my coworker that she doesn’t really need to use every essential oil she owns in the diffuser she brought into work??
3468 2018-12-03 18:31:24 LOL...Cannabis Oil....Are you ready to enjoy this “ trip “ ??? #AFull420
3469 2018-12-03 18:31:20 If even one whale dies, then that will hasten the END of Big Oil. Oil will be replaced with renewable even sooner in that case. So please, environmentalists, make sure you are out there tracking seismic damage to the sea population. But first, help STOP the GOP from allowing this
3470 2018-12-03 18:31:17 Why are they spending so much on solar power when the Permian Basin in west Texas is awash with natural gas. There is so much natural gas, it’s at a negative value. Power plants can get all they want for next to nothing, and might be paid to take it, by oil companies.
3471 2018-12-03 18:30:58 are seeing a lot of Snake Oil sellers and ego manics, rushing into the void that has opened up in education, where the average person is ill equipped to verify even basic facts, let alone new found evidence from science in general and Quantum physics in particular.
3472 2018-12-03 18:30:54 I have a friend who's adventurous with food.

  He's the type who would use palm oil to fry pancake and use bread to eat rice.

3476 2018-12-03 18:30:33 It’s not often I’ll make political posts but enough is enough. Trump needs to stay away from the Antarctic wilderness. There are other ways of finding oil and this is not one of them. Leave it untouched! @realDonaldTrump
3477 2018-12-03 18:30:29 Alternatively, Hillary is:

- PAC Queen
- ACA is more than enough
- More Wars Please!
- $12 min wage fine
- $150K student loans fine

3481 2018-12-03 18:30:17 I use some shit I don't remember the name but it gets rid of some oil
3482 2018-12-03 18:30:13 Anybody who would spend that kind of money to hang out in a country club to be nier the orange baboon, it's got too much fucking money to spend. And probably the only people who will pay that kind of cash are more of Trumps Oil Company lobbyists and foreign lobbyist.
3483 2018-12-03 18:30:03 I mean is there anything coconut oil can’t do?! I use it to soften my skin, whiten my teeth and alter the orbit of protoplanets.
3484 2018-12-03 18:30:00 #Alberta has ordered oil producers in the province to curtail output by 325,000 barrels a day.
3485 2018-12-03 18:29:55 basically Trump used him to bring oil prices down by increasing production, just to get some brownie points from his base.  In return he was given get-outta-jail-free-card on Kashoggi barbaric murder n dismemberment. KSA is stuck in 9th century.
3486 2018-12-03 18:29:55 Unfortunately oil is used in plastic when we could use fully biodegradable alternatives so that's a no brainer lol
3487 2018-12-03 18:29:54 I hear eucalyptus oil is perfect for that

3489 2018-12-03 18:29:43 Canadians should  just  stop making cars , oil production , moving product by train , stop making piplines  etc ...  just  make  sure  my medical benefits keep rolling

3491 2018-12-03 18:29:37 I've been to a pharmacy 3 times since moving to Berlin, and each time they told me to get a life and suggested there were better ways to spend my money. I feel ignored in my pain if I don't get sold 2 different brands of snake oil!

3496 2018-12-03 18:28:55 Reportedly 80% of the 320,000 bbl/day capacity of the Pine Bend Refinery in Minneapolis comes from heavy Alberta crude. That refinery wins big with lower priced heavy oil from Canada. The owners of the Pine Bend Refinery? Koch Industries.

3499 2018-12-03 18:28:46 A long way from Alice B Tokeless. Back in my sordid youth, however, I would take all the leaves and cook them down in a crock pot with water and butter. At the end of the day, all the oil glomped onto the butter. Great for cooking.

3504 2018-12-03 18:28:39 World leaders @COP24 not optimistic to limit global warming.But there's reason enough to move from oil/gas to solar/wind. Only need to look at #G20 where the Saudi Prince and President Putin appeared cheerfully. Their performance was a slap in the face of human rights & democracy

3513 2018-12-03 18:27:53 Deep family ties to the wealthy Hinckley oil family. A Hinckley tried to kill RR while GHWB was VP. Hmmm.    The media labeled the shooter a vagabond more or less at the time.
3514 2018-12-03 18:27:40 Are you serious? Over a hundred thousand Kurds of Rojava are here in Bashur. Everybody knows the situation is dire. The system is working because of oil being sold. You are misrepresenting facts and reality, a logical fallacy.

3517 2018-12-03 18:27:34 Oil receives more subsidies per kilowatt of energy output than any other energy source so you might not want to bring up subsidies here...
3518 2018-12-03 18:27:33 Very correct ...the only climate problem we have is gas flaring by oil companies refusing to convert it to usable energy... our major problem is security
3519 2018-12-03 18:27:25 can’t believe I gotta drink more castor oil in a bit lmao that shit’s gross but I need to be empty...... just so I can eat tomorrow evening lol love that for me
3520 2018-12-03 18:27:25 Vimal I have being telling people to be using your cooking oil
3521 2018-12-03 18:27:15 When do many in this Country are struggling. Layoffs, plants closing, giving away our oil...
3522 2018-12-03 18:27:05 We are charged 90.00 plus, plus.. for an oil change in our Lincoln .. my brother does his own, probably costs him 30.00 .. a Nissan 4 runner.. the more exquisite the car, the more you pay..
3523 2018-12-03 18:26:58 I am badly surprised to hear that you only cut the production by 8.7%. A cut by 25% would have made a really big impact. And a Government regulated price limit of at least $30 for the barrel of oil should be put in place too. Too bad that CND can't do a proper job! TC-pipeline
3524 2018-12-03 18:26:57 Oil & gas are finite reserves, we have between 10 & 20 billion bbls recoverable now and have produced about 48billion bbls so far, this means at best we have 30% left. New discoveries these are not replacing our consumption, we burn about 1.5million bbls/day.

3528 2018-12-03 18:26:35 I cook with oil and seeds,  I don't microwave
3529 2018-12-03 18:26:32 Alot of #Texas residents are without #insurance because it is too expensive & you can't qualify for benefits just for your children living in the oil field, it's all about money, guess what not many have the luxury of doing nothing for a living. I can't get a bad organ removed
3530 2018-12-03 18:26:15 I don't think Jeff disagrees with you on the importance of Oil and Gas to our economy - given that he spent 15 years in the industry. Also, Council supported the CED component of this package unanimously.
3531 2018-12-03 18:26:11 Too bad there wasn’t a safer way to ship Alberta oil... like a PIPELINE.
3532 2018-12-03 18:26:11 all while a barrel of oil is selling at a low price!
3533 2018-12-03 18:26:06 Aaaaaaand our oil tank is over half empty already and it's only been running for a month hahahahaha yay

3537 2018-12-03 18:25:24 That’s FOR the people. More oil, less money paid at the pump!
3538 2018-12-03 18:25:11 Makes it harder to have Houston option for team.  Also creates risk nhl forces Zona into new Pacific with SoCal media to hype Matt forcing Oil/Flames to central.
3539 2018-12-03 18:25:06 the lying inept narcissist @JustinTrudeau only policy is to lie to everyone and give away billions across the world to make himself look good...while killing industry in Canada...auto sector, oil sector, Mission Accomplished for these fu'king Liberal clowns
3540 2018-12-03 18:25:04 Are you supposed to wipe the oil off eventually?
3541 2018-12-03 18:24:52 Quietly contemplating which was more of a miracle -- the scarce oil burning the candles for 8 days while the Maccabees fought the Greeks, or Reggie Miller scoring 8 points in 9 seconds vs. the Knicks in Game 1 of the 1995 Eastern Conference semis.
3542 2018-12-03 18:24:45 Rabbigfir him warham him.
3543 2018-12-03 18:24:22 It seems to me Canada's federation is at stake if the CUSMA is not passed by the US's new congress and Mexico 's left leaning incoming administration. There is no way Ontario can afford promoting two languages and Alberta won't survive without it's oil and gas industries. #cracks

3546 2018-12-03 18:24:00 Now if we could only try some of that nice oil you will be making........
3547 2018-12-03 18:23:51 I use Cantu too, but I like mixing it up. I like vanilla, almond, coconut, cocoa butter scented stuff. Been using Maui Moisture vanilla bean shampoo/conditioner & I just found Monoi Tiki Tahiti Oil and I love it. I use lots of deep conditioner brands, like good ole' Queen Helene!

3549 2018-12-03 18:23:27 Saw this on a followed's timeline.

Tips 1/2:
- Use water gel or essential oil deodorants. White stick globs up, catches, is annoying to wash out.
- Hair traps sweat and bacteria. I shave pits during summer or when I know I will have limited access to shower (camping).
3550 2018-12-03 18:23:26 you know I’m dating a mechanic when I told his hand and now my hand smells like 2 stroke oil
3551 2018-12-03 18:23:24 Didn't think about water in the fuel system so try heet or Lucas Oil to see if it helps any
3552 2018-12-03 18:23:19 I have NEVER had any love or respect for that man. He was an appalling self-serving traitor to our nation and sovereignty. He was a globalist agent and every weakening of our nation, goes back to him. See Carlisle Group for reference... they killed their competition in oil biz.
3553 2018-12-03 18:23:18 Congratulations bro, more wins ahead
3554 2018-12-03 18:23:17 Aye, the clue is in the name, SIR Ian Wood.
His oil company was primarily involved in low tech maintenance, branching out into some higher tech work, but nothing innovative, just in the right place at the right time
3555 2018-12-03 18:23:07 @SenSchumer Please vote NO to Joe Manchin to head Climate Dept. He is beholden to big oil.
3556 2018-12-03 18:23:03 Hmm. The same people complaining about your tweet will be the same ones screaming when gas prices skyrocket.   All car manufacturers need to produce affordable electric cars then our dependency on oil can decrease
3557 2018-12-03 18:22:57 Exactly
3558 2018-12-03 18:22:54 These lox’s were the best thing to happen to me. As long as I can locate my oil and scarf at night. Lol
3559 2018-12-03 18:22:52 Seems you dont have a clue about the production/reserves ratio of OPEC. At same time, if there is no oil, how long do you think the gas reserves will last...start counting and get futures in coal or nuclear companies after.

3561 2018-12-03 18:22:39 @RachelNotley  Strongly recommend exemption from production cut for oil sold to captive oil refiners by producers when cuts implemented Jan. 1.  No reason to penalize producers who create refining jobs. They are your best business models are they not?

3564 2018-12-03 18:22:15 Mugs, such a one sided program. You love taking pop's at spurs doesn't matter what they do. We have slowly built the club the proper way, not just found a rich tax dodging oil baron to throw money around and buy success. Spurs we're beaten by a team more hungry so what it happens
3565 2018-12-03 18:22:09 "As the auto and oil industry crumble two millionaires give away taxpayers dollars and then pat each other on the back."

Remember when Harper gave 3.5 billion dollars to "bail out" the automotive industry even though GM said they will close oshawa by 2019.
3566 2018-12-03 18:22:05 No oil on Europe so no rush.
3567 2018-12-03 18:21:58 He was also laughably wrong in 2014 about the oil running out considering he's a supposed "expert" in that area.
The fact that he's also one of the fishing oligarchs turns my stomach.
3568 2018-12-03 18:21:56 David we had the only dynasty family, the Bush’s. He pushes the clean air act but they’re an oil family, they own a offshore drilling company. They’re worth $400 million. We can debate if he was a good president or not but we shouldn’t change history and facts.
3569 2018-12-03 18:21:54 Yes. I just updated my chart. Oil back in Russia’s comfort zone. Still under Saudi comfort zone. Expect production cuts at opec meet this week. And that’s amazing: that russia will forego money on Saudi behalf.
3570 2018-12-03 18:21:52 All those Roman oil lamps will come in handy

3577 2018-12-03 18:21:24 The attack politics of this company do not fit my personal ethics.  These idiots are a bunch of hypocrites! They’ll take our “dirty oil money” but advocate against the pipelines!!

3580 2018-12-03 18:21:18 And surely companies who profit from oil and plastic production (relatively few) must pay for the clean up and transition to the new economy.
3581 2018-12-03 18:21:15 Alberta is in a recession. It’s as serious or maybe worse than 2008/09.  Almost everyone, personally in Albertaand beyond  is impacted by lower oil prices.

3586 2018-12-03 18:20:37 Hanukkah is not a Zionist holiday. The Jewish religious holiday of Hanukkah lasts eight
days to remember, and celebrate, the miracle of the one cruse of oil lasting eight days.
Zionists hijacked the holiday just as they'd hijacked Palestine!
3587 2018-12-03 18:20:37 car oil!!!!!!!!!!!
3588 2018-12-03 18:20:36 I imagine historians/ investigative reporters are burning the midnight oil to keep up with daily events. Never ever anything even close to this bizarre Presidency. The rapid pace of lies, financial conflicts, cabinet chaos , fire and fury tweets boggles the mind. Exhausting
3589 2018-12-03 18:20:30 Funny, she hates the oil sands and helped create this mess with her buds @CanadianPM .  Now she pretends to care...
3590 2018-12-03 18:20:28 These people were paid by the US oil companies to fight the pipeline so they could get the oil for less since it is now landlocked in Alberta... the States now gladly buy the oil from here on sale. You made things worse and ruined Alberta you ignorant jerk!
3591 2018-12-03 18:20:26 Some people eat Yorkies with motor oil (Marmite) bleurg

45: Why can't Trump be more like Bush.
3597 2018-12-03 18:19:56 If I buy more red.  In theory I will have to buy more of most colors.  The problem with oil painting is the shit gets everywhere if youre doing it right.  I swear the last starter set I bought came with more paint.  Oil painting is the only art they seem to take seriously tho
3598 2018-12-03 18:19:54 Hey dummy, read between the lines. The petrodollar system is ending. What maintains that system? A military occupation of the Middle East, and a huge military budget to defend the oil markets and strong arm countries into holding US paper assets.
3599 2018-12-03 18:19:48 I’d rather accept money from oil and gas companies than russia and the NRA
3600 2018-12-03 18:19:40 Duh ! We have fooled ourselves w/global warming & fear of contradiction with need for Ice Breakers -while Russia has built them by the dozens some Atomic fueled to stay out for months w/o fueling while we have 2 in ill repair need'g oil tanker close at all times = we get weaker!
3601 2018-12-03 18:19:32 Thank you, it is a very expensive base as I will be only use sls/sles/paraben free base and this has rose geranium essential oil in. Not tested on animals (apart from when Belle needs her muddy paws washing ).

3611 2018-12-03 18:18:47 But Alberta oil sells as Western Canadian Select. Which is the lowest price.
3612 2018-12-03 18:18:46 Main q is 'What are we going to do about it?'. Good news is the actions have other benefits even for someone not sold on climate change. E.g reduce/reuse/recycle saves money. When can afford electric cars improves local air quality - also imho a more stable world when not oil led
3613 2018-12-03 18:18:43 Trudeau and his Government, has done nothing except  buy Trans-Mountain and then allow it to go to court shelving it, instead of pushing it thru as suggested, and bringing oil to new markets!! Moreau speaks with a fork tongue, he and Trudeau are a good pair
3614 2018-12-03 18:18:38 Things just got much more interesting in the oil patch.
3615 2018-12-03 18:18:37 Was told a weird story in Mechelen yesterday: allegedly, English beer lacks foam due to hops cross-fertilised with wild varieties, increasing oil content. Besides strong doubts, I've never heard anything like this before. Has anyone? Seems to originate in Belgian beer textbooks?
3616 2018-12-03 18:18:31 Dollars and oil over dead journalists.
3617 2018-12-03 18:18:23 Happy Hanukkah!  When you're ready for that oil change, come see us at 3105 S Jupiter Road Garland, Texas

3619 2018-12-03 18:17:52 A US-China conciliation along with the Saudi-Russian agreement on extending oil cuts at G20 may eliminate current barriers for the price increase while reducing uncertainty in the market. Those actions may will reflect in a price rebound with the OPEC meeting in Vienna this week.
3620 2018-12-03 18:17:51 The supporters of yellow vest movement must understand that they need to sort out this issue by peaceful demonstrations &not through turmoil.#more turmoil leads to more spilling of oil and then their is no point crying over spilt oil.Its just futile.# thinkwise#beoptimistic
3621 2018-12-03 18:17:47 Jeremy Corbyn has a history to stand for peace from his earliest days, never changed..that's the route you went on by saying he was a friend of Hamas..etc, his history and his every day tweets suggest different..The media need war as it's connected with oil  (hence the smears)
3622 2018-12-03 18:17:38 Sancho looks a better fit. More of a goal threat and gets in behind with runs. Pulisic would be really good at Chelsea or United, Sancho would be great for us or Oil Money FC that let him go

3627 2018-12-03 18:17:15 I notice that the one thing @Billwhiteford should have asked the obscenely rich anti-Indy proBrexit AngloScot oil man Ian Wood, is what are you doing to counter #ClimateChange? The answer is nothing. Complete failure by @BBCScotlandNews to challenge his selfish behaviour
3628 2018-12-03 18:17:14 Went through that 2 yrs ago... see if you can get some Rick Simpson oil.. it can help her feel better longer. My heart is sad for you
3629 2018-12-03 18:17:08 Are you guys ever happy? What do you expect some magic wand and oil glut will change? They choose to over produce when the refineries in the US are off line. Bad business decision.

3637 2018-12-03 18:16:42 I am an oil & gas lawyer in US - shale plays & technology caused a huge supply. There are reserves for hundreds of years in US alone. That's what led to the oil crash. US now a net exporter of refined products. We don't need Saudi, Ven oil. Helps US if they walk.

3649 2018-12-03 18:15:31 Texas is a place with a lot of people who work in this industry. Ted Cruz repeatedly hit O'Rourke for his record of voting against the oil and gas industry.
3650 2018-12-03 18:15:20 Well snap, staff are trained fully to help with that. I would recommend dream cream, can't go wrong with it. It's catered for sensitive skin types and has healing properties/ingredients like rose oil n lavender oil. It's always a safe bet n i use it for my face and body.
3651 2018-12-03 18:15:12 How?  Gateway was stalled under Harper and killed under Trudeau. Clipper was built to take oil to the US (part of our current issue). Keystone was started with Harper and delayed by Obama. Line 9b was a reversal and expansion to take light crude to Quebec.

3694 2018-12-03 18:10:47 Hanging on to oil as our number one source of revenue is like relying on gambling winnings. Some days you are going to lose, other days you are going to win big. The rest of us however, just want some stability and don't like the ups and downs that come with oil prices. #akleg

3704 2018-12-03 18:09:48 Governments. Look at what Obama did to the US coal industry, why Macron is trying to put up fuel taxes in France, why Trudeau is blocking oil projects in Canada, and why the UN continue to flex their muscles via the Climate Conferences, now in Poland.
3705 2018-12-03 18:09:43 Loving @BBCScotlandNews coverage of Sir Ian Wood's pearls of wisdom as if A) he was a minor deity and B) we weren't engulfed in a catastrophic climate breakdown in which oil plays a major role. Astonishing stuff.

3723 2018-12-03 18:07:57 Part of problem is when regular people make political donations they have to report their employers, but those all get rolled up / tarred as if it were the CORPORATIONS making the contribution. Plenty of Wall Street, oil & gas, other workers contributing mightily to progressives
3724 2018-12-03 18:07:53 Much of the mess we're in now with oil dependence, the Deep State being out of control, the political miasma we have now--can be laid at the feet of George H.W. Bush. Good riddance, now burn the husk.
3725 2018-12-03 18:07:52 Coconut oil is life!  Hehe
3726 2018-12-03 18:07:49 buuuuuut the oil.
3727 2018-12-03 18:07:47 psa: if you put coconut oil on your face it makes a great moisturizer!!!
3728 2018-12-03 18:07:36 My mom has a thing about all the oil in the ramen noodles, so I was raised eating it like that! 

The exception is cup-o-noodles, which I avoid anyway. XD
3729 2018-12-03 18:07:32 Yep migraines I’ll take ibuprofen but that’s it. I’ll try the oil thanks 
3730 2018-12-03 18:07:16 Even without climate change, shouldn´t this be a priority if for no other reason than oil is going to get progressively more expensive to the point that running the economy on it is unsustainable? It´s a limited resource and the easiest reserves are already gone.
3731 2018-12-03 18:07:08 Can someone tell me how to say no when the oil change guy is trying to sell me shit rather than just the oil change I came for

3734 2018-12-03 18:07:02 CBD oil is already a billion dollar business. Plant it!
3735 2018-12-03 18:06:53 Right. Why not have it your way and just hand the free world's strategic oil reserves to Iran?
Only drunks and fools believe the centuries-old conflict between Wahhabi extremists, their Sunni hierarchy, Shia Islam and Persia is a simple problem.
3736 2018-12-03 18:06:38 Shhhh! Trying to be quiet so that I can hear the mailman when he comes because my CINNAMON CBD Oil is coming today!!

3737 2018-12-03 18:06:37 He only cares about his needs and big oil he’s a Bad person all the way around...

3742 2018-12-03 18:06:17 Things to do when you are sad: Drink   coffee. Call a friend. Dance badly, wherever you are. Bomb yourself with essential oil (vibe fumigation). Rest in sadness for a moment and let it rejuvenate you.
3743 2018-12-03 18:06:12 I know me too .. I justpour them in cold oil then heat them slowly
3744 2018-12-03 18:06:10 truly the Smoked Herring Fillets in Oil of music
3745 2018-12-03 18:06:07 that's obvious, but the cost of the build and the environmental issues make the economics ridiculous, ESPECIALLY when oil is now cheaper and is shipped in for less. the numbers are available. look at the 2 massive spills over the last 5 yrs and then try to argue the risk. sorry
3746 2018-12-03 18:06:07 Agreed, you just have to keep trying, someone will help. The squeaky wheel gets the oil.

3748 2018-12-03 18:05:50 ".... as the waterways used to ship oil provide his people’s entire livelihood"

Is that meant to be a joke or just maximum hyperbole? If you believe that for an instant, you've never visited either the Tsawout or the Tsartlip.

That's about as civil a response as I can muster.
3749 2018-12-03 18:05:46 Check these don’t contain PALM OIL !! I was shocked to find out their Frangipane mince pies do 
3750 2018-12-03 18:05:45 Yeah but any car should have any oil changed at 2000 miles. Be bitch and put on your overalls, Jack the car up, and change it yourself.
3751 2018-12-03 18:05:43 just washed my face with coconut oil and WOW it was magical
3752 2018-12-03 18:05:42 I finally got all the stuff for the oil painting, working on it now
3753 2018-12-03 18:05:35 Fine fine Barrister wey sabi 
3754 2018-12-03 18:05:19 Buying a tesla will allow me to purchase cool project cars. The money I’ll be saving in Gas, Oil Changes, and other maintenance will be enough to pick up cheap cars, work on them and have way more fun than one daily alone.
3755 2018-12-03 18:05:17 I just thought it was a well researched article. I'm not arguing for or against the pipeline. I just want honesty that EE is not to replace imported oil although it could be but only with government subsidy to expand refinery capacity. Profits dictate.
3756 2018-12-03 18:05:14 I dropped off my car for an oil change and decided I’d walk back to pick it up for exercise and I’m regretting it. 
3757 2018-12-03 18:05:14 are rashes a problem, do you use a combination of oil and powder?
3758 2018-12-03 18:05:04 8 for the eight days of the miracle (a small amount of oil managed to last 8 days), plus another to light the 8.
3759 2018-12-03 18:05:01 I'm screaming" ask him about his comments about the oil running out".

3762 2018-12-03 18:04:42 Positive art & music on my feed, if you missed any of my recent oil paintings or live singing. I'm off for errands & will catch up with you when I return. Try to unplug a little today, see the joy, even if disturbing or shocking things happen. God bless you. 
3763 2018-12-03 18:04:41 Anyone use CBD oil in their vape? Where did you find it? I’m curious about trying it!
3764 2018-12-03 18:04:41 Lol. ISWAP is Boko Haram biko
3765 2018-12-03 18:04:33 No. It's not. They make an oil as well. The gel is new. It's so lovely. You can get it at Boots.
3766 2018-12-03 18:04:29 Albertans? Seriously? When have the bulk of oil industry profits ever gone to anyone other than corporations and govts?
3767 2018-12-03 18:04:28 Sorry and now I'm done, each to their own and if you saw me or heard me public or employee ignore the bs about protecting the state .. Africa and Muslim countries except where there's oil and friendly regimes suffer.
3768 2018-12-03 18:04:27 And oil too. Oil is not ded.

3770 2018-12-03 18:04:17 Lol, as she laughs her way to the bank. And now Os bragging on how he’s responsible for big oil in US. Jesus, no wonder y’all lost, what you think is important.. book sales, friends in DC, money money money. GTFO W/ your rich folks- you sold out.
3771 2018-12-03 18:04:12 katy, but drenched in catholic guilt oil
3772 2018-12-03 18:04:05 I think we're going to see a second Trudeau term. Scheer just doesn't have the leadership charisma necessary to get elected and Conservatives have chosen a "populist" approach which doesn't sit well with many Canadians. (Oil issues aside)
3773 2018-12-03 18:03:59 Hanukkah is not a Zionist holiday. The Jewish religious holiday of Hanukkah lasts eight days to remember, and celebrate, the miracle of the one cruse of oil lasting eight days. Zionists hijacked the holiday just as they'd hijacked Palestine!
3774 2018-12-03 18:03:55 Remember, they run Merkel's foreign policy.  Totally bought/paid off by the Russians (and big-time open border folks).  Russian oil company Gazprom employer of choice for ex-SPD politicians like Schroeder.
3775 2018-12-03 18:03:44 Fuck knows, some people like getting shat and pissed on so wouldn't surprise me if @RudeRebel1888  loves to oil up a chubster

3777 2018-12-03 18:03:41 “being european is just like mayonnaise with olive oil”
3778 2018-12-03 18:03:40 An oil glut means little to no dependence on middle-East oil companies, so there is that side benefit. Plus OPEC may be losing Qatar as a member.
3779 2018-12-03 18:03:36 I wish they were farmers . But the tragedy is biger . 
I think they do import mor than they breath . That doesn't sound like real farmers . 
Anyway , Don't blame Us we're Not in the gouvernement to change things . (The Oil) The last comment . 
Thank you .our Respect .
3780 2018-12-03 18:03:32 Puppet masters, (like Putin), lobbyists (like the NRA, big oil and defense industry) and big money donors (like the Koch brothers and Mercer) are pulling the strings.
Trump is corrupted - AND our priority.
3781 2018-12-03 18:03:16 That’s because Exxon is in the same group trying to prevent Canadian pipelines to get our product to other then US markets. They want cheaper Alberta Oil. They can get lost cut another 10% and hammer BC as well. We don’t give our resources away for free.
3782 2018-12-03 18:03:04 Who stops Venezuela from producing oil?
3783 2018-12-03 18:03:01 Bhai crude 105 se 50 pe aa gaya. Rupee 8s stronger now. Where is the math? How much we reduced? And it is not about Cong or BJP, govts get huge money from oil route from domestic consumers. Nepal or Srilanka gets cheaper than us from same company
3784 2018-12-03 18:02:59 Ummmm, no. No that isn’t safe; an engine without oil ( or bad oil ) will cease to be. As my Dad says “Cough up the 40$ and get your oil changed. Just don’t use synthetic oil “. ( I have no idea what or why synthetic oil is or does but apparently don’t get that  )
3785 2018-12-03 18:02:57 Great oil dropped 
3786 2018-12-03 18:02:56 People in France are revolting against CO2 tax on fuel. Fake CNN says it's increase in price if crude oil.
3787 2018-12-03 18:02:55 Venezuela's President was "Put in" bc OIL.
3788 2018-12-03 18:02:50 @IngrahamAngle Serving as president is a noble task. Not free of perfection. Bush a globalist looking after private interest (oil, international finance). America always FIRST!
3789 2018-12-03 18:02:48 Now I’m going to get me a oil change
3790 2018-12-03 18:02:45 2Paw counts on his Vitamin D3 caplets (the wee light-golden fellow on the left; I take two of 'em) for extra brain sunshine, tu. I believe the large dark duo might be Flaxseed or Fish Oil Omega 3 'caplets', which I take three of every evening. There is a method for swallowing! :)
3791 2018-12-03 18:02:41 Use vitamin e oil
3792 2018-12-03 18:02:40 That’s motor oil
3793 2018-12-03 18:02:31 Getting my car's oil changed and tires rotated. Should have brought a book.
3794 2018-12-03 18:02:29 Can’t believe em made me think his delivery was oil for his car and turns out he had sent me flowers  what did I do to deserve him
3795 2018-12-03 18:02:29 My organic chemistry prof just said coconut oil is not good for your skin!!!!! #themoreyouknow #facts
3796 2018-12-03 18:02:23 Right, but where trump’s dad may have attended a klan rally in ny in the 20’s, it is proven that Prescott Bush actually supplied hitler with oil and fuel. Fact. And this is coming from someone who despises Trump. I just want us to stop lying to ourselves about our leaders.
3797 2018-12-03 18:02:23 Muscles don't get torn so easily, if you have olive oil get massage done, for some relief then show tomorrow.
3798 2018-12-03 18:02:14 Drew let me educate you on some facts you shouldn’t like... this government has given away 9 BILLION dollars to foreign governments. Lost revenue on oil 8 BILLION. 17 BILLION total. Petty cash I guess to a Socialist fascist(your profile).
3799 2018-12-03 18:02:11 Mmm sesame seeds and oil with soy sauce, maple syrup, maybe some fresh garlic!? Some ginger too perhaps!
3800 2018-12-03 18:02:11 Why is anyone listening to Ian Wood who said  in 2014  that the oil was just about finished ?
3801 2018-12-03 18:02:09 WHY FOR THE LAST TEN/ FIFTEEN YEAR INFLUX OF MIGRANTS R TAKING PLACE ?  MIGRANT CRISIS WILL 0NLY COME UNDER PAUSE WHEN WESTERN & EUROPEAN COUNTRIES  STOP TAKING  CONTROL OVER THE WEAK COUNTRIES (WAR)& STOP MAKING BASE IN THOSE  COUNTRIES FOR MINERALS , FOSSIL OIL AND MARKETS.
3802 2018-12-03 18:02:06 Are you talking about CNN, Fox, both? Hard to tell them apart. I don't watch any of them. I'm sorry you had to spend any time in that cluster. It was a bad idea from beginning, $ for oil, no exit strategy. Disagree or not, I do thank you for your service to this country.
3803 2018-12-03 18:02:02 I decided my hair was weighted down with product and wanted to see what happened if I just used a touch of almond oil and diffused. Cowashed with vo5 moisture milk strawberry and conditioned with the pink not your mother's. Touch of spray at the end to hopefully keep some volume.
3804 2018-12-03 18:01:55 not in the slightest. but watch apocalypse if you want to be scared into using holy oil
3805 2018-12-03 18:01:54 No don't cut it off ! Mine did the same for a WHILE. I started just twisting it with pure castor oil. It a come back slowly. The hair love test your faith, but yuh haffi persevere lol
3806 2018-12-03 18:01:52 .... who have a vested interest in preserving the status quo. Auto manufacturers and oil companies don’t want to replace gasoline engines with new technology. Electric cars aren’t a long-term solution because most electricity is generated with fossil fuels.
3807 2018-12-03 18:01:51 But in past and future too oil prices were and vl be controlled by Saudi & Russia as their proven reserve are about to be end by 2023 and also have reduced oil production. but have large gas reserves which could be game changer. Gud foe the economy when one thinks of clean energy
3808 2018-12-03 18:01:50 Thank you.

So if Talmud states that Chanuka is only about the oil. We must assume everyone agrees.

נכון?
3809 2018-12-03 18:01:45 nagode
3810 2018-12-03 18:01:38 You said specifically "singular oil profits". You corrected your own statement in saying agriculture and services, therefore not "singular". Your foot doesn't taste too good huh?
3811 2018-12-03 18:01:30 Man made climate change isn’t real it’s another elitist scam to save the planet we need to give our money to the very people who own the oil companies and have deliberately held back better products for oil sales.
3812 2018-12-03 18:01:30 Gw biasa pake yg bukan oil control.. Pelembab viva biasa.. Worth it di kulit gw sih, udah 3 tahun pake itu cocok aja
3813 2018-12-03 18:01:29 What is the oil?
3814 2018-12-03 18:01:27 dah boleh lah lepas ni bila orang cakap asyik pakai tudung hitam je, eh sorry sikit ni semalam hitam haritu midnight and yang tengah pakai ni metal dalam almari ada spider oil ink

3817 2018-12-03 18:01:12 WHEN ARE THE PEOPLE GOING TO WAKE UP TO THE FACT THAT TRUMP HASN'T DONE A THING FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON AND HE NEVER WILL. EVERY THING HE DOES IS TO BENEFIT TRUMP IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, STOP FALLING FOR HIS LINES OF BULLSHIT, HES A SNAKE OIL SALESMAN, NOTHING MORE A LIAR A THIEF

3819 2018-12-03 18:01:03 Here are some of the health benefits of olive oil.

  Olive Oil Is Rich in Healthy Monounsaturated Fats
  Olive Oil Contains Large Amounts of Antioxidants
  Olive Oil Has Strong Anti-Inflammatory Properties
3820 2018-12-03 18:01:00 This #Hanukkah when frying #latkes, use vegetable, canola, corn, grape-seed, safflower, or sunflower oil. They have a high “smoke point.” #HappyHanukkah #KeepHanukkahSafe
3821 2018-12-03 18:00:59 Coconut Oil fights off Candida which naturally contains a fatty acid, called caprylic acid. This anti-fungal interferes with Candida growth and replication by poking holes in the walls of the yeast cells, causing them to die off.

3822 2018-12-03 18:00:57 And goya oil too
3823 2018-12-03 18:00:56 Yes. It’ll still rub tho but the oil would prevent that injury that usually occurs.

3829 2018-12-03 18:00:14 Putin is happy to see an incapable leader. He is a kid who is running oil cartel, because his dad only cares about his son and nothing else, when everyone is sidelining mbs, Putin is scoring an important ally, for free, albeit with a hi5.
3830 2018-12-03 18:00:10 Didn’t go to work today and just decided to online shop & get a oil change and already spent like a thousand today  going the fuck home to play my game and not coming back out
3831 2018-12-03 17:59:58 So last night someone spit a piece of gum in my hair. And two of my roommates spent over an hour rubbing peanut butter and oil in my hair and using a tooth brush to get it all out while I bawled my eyes out in the sink.
3832 2018-12-03 17:59:50 Never felt like someone was so proud of me as the oil change guy when I told him I’m running my car into the ground and don’t want anything but the oil change.

3836 2018-12-03 17:59:41 Oil crisis... people losing jobs in Ontario... what commonality do those have? 
Is it poor people in foreign countries possibly getting a chance at education? Will $50m solve either of those problems?
3837 2018-12-03 17:59:36 Maybe peppermint? Should be some natural herb/oil.
3838 2018-12-03 17:59:33 How come US produces more oil than the eastern countries! ? 
3839 2018-12-03 17:59:32 There's a complicated relationship to fuel use involved - right on red's big moment was the late 1970s oil crisis days.
3840 2018-12-03 17:59:31 No nigga Lol i ain’t say ink I said oil
3841 2018-12-03 17:59:15 Nahi..aaj crude oil badha hai 4-5% kal itna hi price badhega?

3844 2018-12-03 17:58:50 My dream is also to work for a major oil and gas company like ExxonMobil. I also want to have a foundation someday where I will meet to the needs of those who want to go to school but don't have the money to do so. God will grant our desires.

3846 2018-12-03 17:58:38 Thank you Donald Trump for arranging for Saudi to increase oil production so to bring prices down!
3847 2018-12-03 17:58:37 She didn't say the type of fat doesn't matter: she said that the fact that they were fried in anything is more important. Granted that partially-hydrogenated veg oil is now out of the food chain except for a very few uses, that's true.
3848 2018-12-03 17:58:34 Not to be confused with - My doctor has a large oil painting in his office that looks very similar to the small house in the card...  Damn..  Is nothing sacred as it's been cut out of his picture..

3852 2018-12-03 17:58:18 I’m at the Subaru dealership to get my oil changed and there’s nothing but old people here... you can clearly tell who’s driving the blue WRX 
3853 2018-12-03 17:58:16 Modi in 50 hours in Argentina participated in G20...he met Saudi prince one o one for india' oil requirement ...he met xi jinping one o one ...in trilateral meeting, Modi  met Japan' Abe & Trump in what Modi called as JAI ...After 12 years, 
3854 2018-12-03 17:58:07 If 325,000 barrels is a small portion of the production, then the total pollution coming from the dirty oil sands is worse than I thought. Extracting this oil is so harmful on a cost/benefit basis.
3855 2018-12-03 17:58:04 well that's the model they are looking for. like you outlined, the taxes from oil GP tax pays for wind farms. the carbon tax would extend the tax to Industry, and then give larger tax breaks to solar and wind. about a $20B shift is needed to go 100% green, or $20/ton of CO2.
3856 2018-12-03 17:57:44 Meanwhile as the third world pulls themselves out of poverty oil consumption will increase from 95 million barrels a day to 110 million barrels a day over the net decade. Build the pipelines !
Canada can help fill that market
3857 2018-12-03 17:57:39 LOL. I feel like mine has plateaued too. I'm trying a few things- being more consistent with my castor+peppermint oil application and argan oil.
3858 2018-12-03 17:57:32 That’s bole. Ask for palm oil and salt sis
3859 2018-12-03 17:57:27 Thanks she is doing great. No more cancer thank to cannabis CBD oil magical healing plant 
3860 2018-12-03 17:57:09 Stuck at the house foreal this time. I caused a fire to the engine of the car the other night. And had to leave the car. Poor thang. I’m sorry. I didn’t know spilling even a drip of oil on the engine could ignite a flame. Oops  but I know now
3861 2018-12-03 17:57:06 Alberta’s oil workers and oil workers in general need to be put out of business and retrained for work in more sustainable energy sectors. #dirtyoil
3862 2018-12-03 17:56:55 I live in Houston and it’s a joke here when you meet someone and they say they “work in oil” bc that can mean 1,000 things in Texas. Construction, law, energy trading, engineering, geologists, etc. if I cut anyone out of my life who’s worked in oil I would know like 4 people.
3863 2018-12-03 17:56:52 Have u heard the term ‘allies’? SA has oil it needs to trade US has military technology skills & commerce SA needs to reform Its the protector of Sunni Islam. Shia Houthis have attacked US & allies for decades They need help Houthis have emerged as a war machine in the region. 
3864 2018-12-03 17:56:52 Apart from oil drills of course, they go deeper than a GP giving a prostate exam! 

Deepest is hundreds of miles, in russia if memory serves?

Rhe ice wall would have to be 100s miles or maybe 1000’s, haven’t done the math, to hold back the oceans, not to mention miles high?
3865 2018-12-03 17:56:46 Masha Allah.....
3866 2018-12-03 17:56:46 Generous. He sells snake oil and buys attention on every timeline in my opinion.
3867 2018-12-03 17:56:45 WTI oil at $53.09/barrel, +$2.15.
3868 2018-12-03 17:56:44 Useless government Notley never did anything to support oil
3869 2018-12-03 17:56:32 Does anyone know where I can buy some oil for my pen
3870 2018-12-03 17:56:29 I have olive oil shouldn’t be heated. Do you have thoughts on this?
3871 2018-12-03 17:56:26 Meanwhile this does not effect the output of other oil producing provinces...a knee jerk reaction to years of governmental paralysis...
3872 2018-12-03 17:56:25 Nothing makes more sense for the climate than sending people from the balmy tropics to Minnesota and northern Maine where they'll have to burn hundreds of gallons of heating oil each winter just to keep from freezing
3873 2018-12-03 17:56:16 this guy getting his oil changed, left his dog in the car and the dog accidently locked the doors
3874 2018-12-03 17:56:16 Heard that this morning. Also heard that Saudia Arabia has between 15-60 years of oil left. We gotta get off petroleum ASAP, for many reasons.
3875 2018-12-03 17:56:08 The entire governance of sauds and gulf states is based on deception and extreme violence against the population who don't follow the line, the regimes must go, atleast don't buy the blood oil, buy clean Canadian oil instead, West is greedy and narcissistic.
3876 2018-12-03 17:56:07 One of the richest countries in oil, no wonder the Mullahs impose harsh controls on the people, they are stealing their resource
3877 2018-12-03 17:55:40 just another way to suck up to big oil
3878 2018-12-03 17:55:40 I’m allergic to the smell of b.o., patchouli oil and abject failure so I go through the drive-thru in my V-8, fossil fuel guzzling Urban Assault Vehicle Ain’t America great 
3879 2018-12-03 17:55:39 For god's sake mate wake up and smell the covfefe this moronic snake oil salesman is peddling. It's the tariffs that have made it difficult to sell cars financially unviable by increasing the production costs associated with various components.
3880 2018-12-03 17:55:35 I'd call 8,000 km of pipeline a significant effort but more needs to be done.  I dont have much faith in the Liberals given their oft stated goal is to eliminate the oil fields.
3881 2018-12-03 17:55:33 Wow. Keep firing. More grease to your elbows
3882 2018-12-03 17:55:30 Idk if you can do anything but one of my friends talked about gurgling(?) coconut oil in your month but that’s hella disgusting
3883 2018-12-03 17:55:25 Product coconut oil cek di themakeupchoice. Ada shampoo, condi, hair mask, hair oil. Ya lumayan sih harganya dibanding sampo biasa tp ga ngecewain sih aku jg make
3884 2018-12-03 17:55:22 @BensonsForBeds is a joke! Waited a month for our new bed only for it to turn up with oil down one side of the mattress... only have to wait 3-4 weeks for a replacement! Sleeping on the couch for Christmas isn’t quite what we had in mind! 
3885 2018-12-03 17:55:16 Does the 5-a-day rule extend to #doughnuts on #Chanukah?    #miracles #oil #delicious
3886 2018-12-03 17:55:04 Maybe that scone is completely free of animal derived products including butter, but then would be made with copious amounts of vegan-approved ... palm oil 
3887 2018-12-03 17:55:00 Trudeau you spend our rax dollars like a drunken sailor.  Shame on you. The west does not seem to be included in any of your plans, other rhan you phasing out the oil industry and imposing a manditory cardon tax.  So so sad for us out west.

Sailor
3888 2018-12-03 17:54:48 No sun and no Goya oil 
3889 2018-12-03 17:54:41 Also the timing and quality of goals against, and general conveyance of stability & having teams back.  Latter factors huge impact on oil over last 2 yrs imho
3890 2018-12-03 17:54:38 Big Oil has gone #boombust several times throughout history. Thought the #freemarket didn't listen to the governments, but your government would be some kind of market whisperer? More pipelines would only mean selling more oil for less. #discountprices #abpoli #cdnpoli
3891 2018-12-03 17:54:27 This is a tough one. It’s between 3...the banana shampoo as my hair feels so much better. Camomile cleansing oil because it’s the best make up remover. Finally, the Tea-tree oil as it’s great with spots....it’s a tough one  #IllGoTeaTree #enchantedbynature #FillYourStockings
3892 2018-12-03 17:54:26 Got into astrology and the next thing I know, I have an essential oil diffuser for my bedroom and for my car
3893 2018-12-03 17:54:24 One large #nuclear plant in the middle of an ocean, run by the #UnitedNations & providing power to all dirty coal / oil producers until #RenewableEnergy catches up?
3894 2018-12-03 17:54:23 Have you also used Biafine on burns? Sunburns but also if you burn yourself in the kitchen--it's a miracle! I had a splatter burn from oil ON MY FACE and it completely healed it and left not even the tiniest mark.
3895 2018-12-03 17:54:16 Sana oil 
3896 2018-12-03 17:54:08 It wasn’t snake oil as we think of it today. The combination of cannabis extract & alcohol (in 1 tsp per hour) likely was a bit sedating, so if someone had anxiety, depression, mania, palpitations, insomnia, it would relax them a bit & give temporary relief.
3897 2018-12-03 17:54:06 I sadly live in third world country - Germany. We have barely few megabit Internet, phones are sporadically working, we heat with oil and cannot afford A/C.
We pay 1€ for liter of heating oil, yet it is the cheapest energy source.

3900 2018-12-03 17:53:49 Boo Hoo!...Is the big refiner mad because they'll have to pay more for their refining oil? Now you know what it feels like to buy gas in #Canada.
@ImperialOil
3901 2018-12-03 17:53:46 I’ve always seen it as the “failure of Jewish oil accounting” holiday. It’s like a head on a pike for every CPA we’ve ever produced.
3902 2018-12-03 17:53:44 We import oil because we dont have alot of oil in our land since we can't change it with technology 
But why do we import jets? Can't we make it ourselves? We have so many engineers and so much youth seeking  jobs
3903 2018-12-03 17:53:19 Yes oil mill market 
3904 2018-12-03 17:53:04 Oil production and consumption is killing our planet. In many ways you can frame this as a great thing for the environment and Canada. We need to stimulate the economy with new GREEN jobs, not more fossil fuel production.
3905 2018-12-03 17:53:03 Is oil having today a dead Qat(ar) bounce ?
3906 2018-12-03 17:52:59 Dont forget antibodies, electrolytes and growth factors. Much more to the tears than just oil, mucin and h2o.
3907 2018-12-03 17:52:53 They're cutting production because the price is too low. In this specific case wouldn't a carbon tax actually help if it increased the price of oil?
3908 2018-12-03 17:52:39 Qatar has gone out of OPEC to sell Iran's gas and oil.
3909 2018-12-03 17:52:19 Wowwwww is that oil paint or acrylic? It's amazing!
3910 2018-12-03 17:52:18 I've been going to city council meetings where land use decisions are made several times per month for many years and I've never once seen an oil lobbyist in any of those meetings.
3911 2018-12-03 17:52:14 Apply oil.
3912 2018-12-03 17:51:59 sana oil !!!
3913 2018-12-03 17:51:56 If they open today going after this oil change
3914 2018-12-03 17:51:53 Kare they attacked me once here telling me about international oil shortage when I mentioned NPF. These streets are not safe
3915 2018-12-03 17:51:47 The Cafe Mac Pizza today will be: chewy crust with damp motor oil and cheese.
3916 2018-12-03 17:51:42 The greatest exporters of oil in Africa yet the nation with the highest population of poverty even beating India, were does all the money go!!! Doesn’t that scares me!! It bloody well frightens me!!!
3917 2018-12-03 17:51:23 Especially an oil man!
3918 2018-12-03 17:51:19 Couldn’t be arsed to go Paks for Hair gel so I’ve been using castor oil as a substitute all week... my headphones keep sliding off about to lose it
3919 2018-12-03 17:51:18 Tiny oil producer Qatar pulls out of OPEC...and seeks it´s future in the LNG business...the decision will be active from Jan. 1 2019 on. Qatar Petroleum expects an increase in its natural gas production from 77 million metric tons/year to 110mn mt/yr in the coming years (NGW).

3921 2018-12-03 17:51:12 I have no affection for this axis of evil. Every hobbling of our economy and nation, can be traced back to him.
See Carlisle Group and how Jr. Killed the competition to their oil business. 
See CIA involvement in China, the corruption that started there.
See repeal Glass Steagal
3922 2018-12-03 17:51:00 Jamaican castor oil, tea tree oil, Shea moisture products
3923 2018-12-03 17:50:50 I’m thinking this is just another one of those BS promises that only works for paid actors in ads that are splattered all over my Twitter feed. The makers of pain meds all over the world stop it if it really helped. All promises and no real proof. Can you say snake oil salesmen
3924 2018-12-03 17:50:49 Need a new oil plug -.-
3925 2018-12-03 17:50:27 Nah, I still think about 9/11 quite a bit. Changed my life for the worse forever. I think about all those familes left behind. Then I think about the wars after and my blood boils. One of/if not the biggest military blunders this country has ever committed. All for money and oil.
3926 2018-12-03 17:50:27 Man with forked tounge.....remember he told us oil was finished
3927 2018-12-03 17:50:23 Did you remember to change your oil? Retweet for awareness
3928 2018-12-03 17:50:21 盛り上げると燃えあげるは意味違いますよ！！

3932 2018-12-03 17:49:58 Mmmm.... crabs with built in oil.  No need to add any.  Awesome!  Would go perfect in my non-stick pan.
3933 2018-12-03 17:49:47 #WTI #crude #oil has weakest month in 10 yrs in Nov and still #OPEC basket Nov avg was $65.33/bbl vs $60.74 in Nov 2017 and followed 6 mos at +$70. If current worry over #demand & rising US production is unwarranted, it still provides nice cover for output cuts. #OOTT #energy
3934 2018-12-03 17:49:35 @npford Alberta cutting oil production next month. Positive or negative for our province moving forward?
3935 2018-12-03 17:49:35 Ghana to impose tax on anointing oil, stickers, other religious merchandise

3936 2018-12-03 17:49:32 I am a walking essential oil
3937 2018-12-03 17:49:27 Very good question: Problem being the corruption is deep rooted into the GOP!!! Oil companies and pharmaceuticals etc... Have bought ALL their asses up. Harming our democracy violating our Constitution
3938 2018-12-03 17:49:26 Trump doesn't care about Corbyn.  Like his predecessors, he only does what the US oil and arms industries tell him to do, & they definitely don't want Corbyn elected. Trump's too dim to understand the issues involved.
3939 2018-12-03 17:49:18 EU is not a Peace Project but a Piece if Sh!t.  EU Laws are being used to take control of the UK Military (5th biggest in the world). NATO respects Sovereign Countries but EU looks to colonise them. Germany depends on Oil & Gas - War is coming
3940 2018-12-03 17:49:13 I agree with your oil sentiment. And you do recall that jacking the oil price is EXACTLY what the good folks at @GoldmanSachs et al did during the last recession, right? Where are they now? Rotating in and out of @realDonaldTrump's @Cabinet
3941 2018-12-03 17:49:13 ทำได้แค่ปล่อยมันไปเหอะสุดท้ายความรู้สึกที่ได้รับก็แย่อยู่ดี
3942 2018-12-03 17:49:09 引火したら、もう手遅れさ…
3943 2018-12-03 17:49:03 Because it's mnet  mnet and SM/YG artists is like water and oil 
3944 2018-12-03 17:49:02 I've got to be honest. I don't want them to prove sustainability anymore. I just want them to stop growing it. The legacy of death from Palm oil is too great. I just don't want anything to do with it. I avoid it whenever possible.
3945 2018-12-03 17:48:55 Coconut oil is for literally everything 
3946 2018-12-03 17:48:51 Baby oil atau minyak zaitun sih aku

Happy to tell you that today our system generated a trade signal on $CL #WTI .
3948 2018-12-03 17:48:47 There was a very nice oil based wood polish in the err thing
3949 2018-12-03 17:48:43 me looking at the map in the beginning of the game: is that a dlc?

me interacting with the "spoiler" side missions: is this a dlc?

me arriving at the oil rig: is this the dlc?
3950 2018-12-03 17:48:36 like any good socialist economics is not his forte. his plan is to eliminate corruption and that will bring the economic boom that will transform mexico. higher pensions for everybody, more hospitals, fast trains, more oil drills etc.
3951 2018-12-03 17:48:25 Por favor como.van a subir el precio del Gas Oil , en este momento donde se usa para trabajar , en este momento tan dificil.

3954 2018-12-03 17:48:08 The whole issue her is few barrels of oil .. so , what’s the fuss here ?? Try some rationality in your tweets ..
3955 2018-12-03 17:47:55 Groundnut oil would probably have the same effect on your skin

3959 2018-12-03 17:47:39 if your boobs ever get sore from your period, try mixing clary sage essential oil with a carrier oil (i used coconut) and massaging the mixture onto the tender area! i went from not being able to walk without holding them in place, to no pain at all!
3960 2018-12-03 17:47:22 That's what i wanted to say,,,, upon all his miracles, he will demand for the whole West Africa,especially oil regions...
3961 2018-12-03 17:47:17 Obviously the lasers having to do soemthing with the wildfires and this is not anyway supposed to be offensive towards anyone who’s lost there home I am very sorry for anyone in California who lost their home I almost lost mine earlier this year due to an oil company exploding
3962 2018-12-03 17:47:08 It's not o  I need to buy Goya oil
3963 2018-12-03 17:47:05 Sir Ian Wood flip-flops more than an Aussie Barbecue, one minute the oil's running out, the next we have 50 years worth left. Why would anyone believe a word he says?
3964 2018-12-03 17:47:01 “Bush went to war for oil profits”

“Cheney went to war for Halliburton profits”

“Trump colluded with Russia for personnel gain”

See the trend of this phony narrative? It’s based on leftist hate and envy
3965 2018-12-03 17:47:00 You will sound like gen that engine oil just finished inside dear
3966 2018-12-03 17:46:56 today I'm getting an oil change by myself, from here on out I will only respond to ms. mckay because I'm GROWN
3967 2018-12-03 17:46:51 Just heard something interesting. They used "mosquito" (DAMOCLES 2) to collapse huge underground "feeder tubes" to cut off the easy oil supply in the middle east. I would look for big new drilling sites in other areas now.
3968 2018-12-03 17:46:38 Président,  les gilets jaunes ont besoin d'un geste fort venant de votre part.
Faites marche arrière sur l'ISF, avec la ressource, indemnisez les dégats subis durant les manifestations, le surplus servira à controler les taxes sur essence et gas oil faites le savoir en personne.
3969 2018-12-03 17:46:14 Nope, like you can have vegetarian food even if it’s not certified halal. The fries and fish are cooked in separate and specific oil.
3970 2018-12-03 17:46:13 Driving through Sabah the destruction of the equatorial jungle is almost complete... replaced by edge to edge palm oil plantation. It looks like Armageddon!! We must preserve what’s left and rehabilitate with the correct!!! Biodiversity!
3971 2018-12-03 17:46:13 Guessing oil.
3972 2018-12-03 17:46:12 All up for being this independent woman until it comes to my car. Oil check has been avoided for a good 8 months (wouldnt even know what im checking for) and now my breaks sound like a rusty razor scooter from 2003  wooo
3973 2018-12-03 17:46:02 Canada also has one of the coldest climates in the G-20 and greatest distances between major cities so duhhh yeah #cdnpoli does have relatively high GHGs but quantitatively we're still low, plus we're developing leading-edge technologies to get off oil, but hey have a nice chat.
3974 2018-12-03 17:45:56 Trump doesn't know who Corbyn or Sadiq Khan are.  Trump only does what the US oil and arms industries tell him to do.  He's too thick to understand the issues involved.
3975 2018-12-03 17:45:51 No wonder people hated weed so much for so many years! These assholes were selling it as snake oil.
3976 2018-12-03 17:45:43 @PeterZeihan How about the Canadian Govt putting production caps on Canadian oil producers?  Maybe they’ll join OPEC
3977 2018-12-03 17:45:43 Some random man on the street came up and blessed me, and before I even knew was was happening he rubbed some random oil on me
3978 2018-12-03 17:45:42 Europa League 2: Sons of Liberty, where the qualifiers are held on an oil tanker, while the final is held on the roof of the NYSE on Wall Street.
3979 2018-12-03 17:45:28 Pourquoi le parlement a voté, à la quasi unanimité,ces augmentations pluri annuelle? Il faut quand même continuer à aligner les taxes sur l'essence et du gaz oil.
3980 2018-12-03 17:45:13 Ummmm George HW Bush does not have a good environmental record their family's massive wealth comes from Oil and that's all you need to know????
3981 2018-12-03 17:44:57 สอนนน
3982 2018-12-03 17:44:56 Where's your critical thinking skills? Like the recently discovered berry that destroys cancer cells, or cannabis oil which also kills cancer, big pharma can't patent it & therefore make a profit from it so anything natural will always be 'fringe' at best if it can't be demonised
3983 2018-12-03 17:44:54 Independent party Presidential nominee @ThomasTiber2018 when asked about how to combat climate change:  “we need to move towards electric cars, (oil) is going to run out eventually.”

3987 2018-12-03 17:44:21 for example, in 2017 where 407,700 gallons were leaked in South Dakota. But I’m glad if you’re willing to compromise one of the largest fresh water reserves in the world with an oil pipeline when there are other ways of transport. As for the gun control, our idea is to simply

4001 2018-12-03 17:43:06 no, that's the smell of dead orang-utans.... palm oil used in chocolate contributed to 100,000 orang-utan deaths in the past 15 years.
4002 2018-12-03 17:43:04 Oil prices jumped after the United States and China agreed to a 90-day truce in a trade dispute, and ahead of a meeting this week of the producer club OPEC that is expected to cut supply.

4005 2018-12-03 17:42:52 I prefer to focus on the extended life of the oil and see it as an energy conservation holiday. The menorah is Judaism's Prius!
4006 2018-12-03 17:42:45 The oil price is on the up again. But there is too much of the market withdrawing oil procurement. This trend should continue a bit. The last time a barrel was under $70 we were paying R11/l. Lets just get back there.
4007 2018-12-03 17:42:43 But if this was real, sending oil through a pipeline is a greater danger to our water supply specifically as it will travel over the Ogallala aquifer in Nebraska. The original Keystone pipeline that goes through the Dakotas and down eastern Nebraska has had a number of leaks,
4008 2018-12-03 17:42:42 Blockchain has its uses, the primary use seems to be a marketing buzzword to sound all neo-tech, Since most people don't understand how it works, it makes the perfect snake oil for a digital age.

There are legitimate uses, they are just very few and highly specialized.
4009 2018-12-03 17:42:31 The big oil firms, some smaller ones, used to have many refineries in AB.  Edmonton & Calgary used to have refinery rows.  Facilities in Lethbridge & Balzac for sure.  Likely other towns.  Don't know what's left in FtMc. It's their oil--they found they made more $ refining in US.

4011 2018-12-03 17:42:24 Again. Easy to wag your finger at oil & gas. Apple has a bigger CO2 footprint then Suncor. Yet we tweet from our i-phones. Car plants are closing because nobody is buying small cars.We are buying SUVs.Lets get on track. I agree. But lets not cut off our nose  to spite your face.
4012 2018-12-03 17:42:20 I'd not want any chocolate this christmas that contains palm oil.

4015 2018-12-03 17:42:14 Donating right now to EDF. Let’s sue Trump now for violating the Arctic Wildlife Reserve by opening for oil drilling and for continuing to ignore climate change. What a short-sighted ‘businessman’.

4019 2018-12-03 17:41:51 I need some "shut the fuck up" essential oil
4020 2018-12-03 17:41:48 think about one dead orang-utan for each door you open. I'm avoiding palm oil. I think Quality Street need to do the same.
4021 2018-12-03 17:41:45 Lol really if you mean went in to keep it out of the hands of some crazed dictators yea! And just so u know its oil which gas  is a byproduct of!
4022 2018-12-03 17:41:39 I was confusing the two main types of oil produced in Alberta. But oil economics is not as intuitive as one might think. The oil glut created due to lack of pipeline capacity affects the world price of bitumen based oil. Increased supply would close the gap.
4023 2018-12-03 17:41:36 Qatar announced it is leaving OPEC as it wants to focus its time and strategy on LNG and was amongst the smallest OPEC members in terms of exported oil production.

4037 2018-12-03 17:40:24 why not get creative and use a different oil instead of palm oil? 100,000 dead orang-utans in 15 years can't be wrong.

4045 2018-12-03 17:39:44 We used around 1,000 tonnes of palm oil a year in our own label food before we took action to remove it - a tiny amount by the standards of most of our competitors.

4053 2018-12-03 17:38:58 As a fellow oil wife I know exactly what she is feeling. Like my husband these are good men out in the field. I live in a rural oil area. Do you know some of the first people to stop and help you if you are stranded or check to see if your ok? It’s those oil workers
4054 2018-12-03 17:38:46 Petrol price in Jamnagar today was 68.99 rupees per liter. I am hoping many have recovered their money which they lost when petrol price jumped to 83rs. I am feeling Modi govt is bent on bankrupting oil companies.

4067 2018-12-03 17:37:52 Qatar departure from OPEC circumventes US sanctions against Iran because the quantity of his exports is known via OPEC and he can export large quantities of Iranian oil in the name of the government of Qatar. This is all.

4092 2018-12-03 17:34:55 @LBIAirport any chance of you turning the heating up? The entire airport is freezin! Is the heating broke or is your budget too small to afford oil?
4093 2018-12-03 17:34:55 do you have any examples?
4094 2018-12-03 17:34:54 Food for thought:
Does not everyone know what oil is? A fossil (yes dinosaurs and  like that) fuel! Do u think that is UNLIMITED? WE NEED TO GO ELECTRIC (seriously all u older ppl need to move into the freaking times and just back Elon and ppl like him) smh

@realDonaldTrump
4095 2018-12-03 17:34:49 Cynical thoughts for today: Oil exploration to proceed on Alaska north shore and in Atlantic, killing whales and dolphins; murderers in Riyadh and Moscow are welcomed to G-20 with smiles; and endless red tide in Florida and CA wildfires greeted with climate change denial.  ugh!
4096 2018-12-03 17:34:47 Spray lavender oil on it, mix with water 1-3 and spray before lights etc. Mines doesn't even look it's way

4098 2018-12-03 17:34:41 Universal care costs a shitload. You wouldnt save money. Countries like norway can do it because of the oil money and small population

4100 2018-12-03 17:34:29 I have a can opener, but I don’t know the last time I used it to open a can of tuna. Chicken of the Sea to Spanish and Italian brands have all had the easy open tabs. The European brands are better because they’re packed in olive oil.
4101 2018-12-03 17:34:27 I get it. I came home yesterday to a spider in my room and he dropped behind the bed. I vacuumed and spread tea tree and peppermint oil everywhere but I don't know if he left, or is dead, or got sucked up and why must there be a spider in my room of all places?!?
4102 2018-12-03 17:34:24 What's killing their economy is the impact of falling oil prices on a country whose dependence on oil exports has grown continually for a century. What's wrong with Maduro is his growing authoritarianism.
4103 2018-12-03 17:34:22 Scotland forms 8% of Uk, its UK oil, so yes seems fair

4107 2018-12-03 17:34:06 Seismic tests could also trigger quakes.  Quakes & tsunamis that could kill many thousands.  Of course oil & gas industries will never be held properly accountable for the nightmares they leave in their wake.

4112 2018-12-03 17:33:46 Dear #ouridiotprimeminister ,
Why don't you instead give this money to the people who are losing their jobs in Oshawa due the GM plant closing and to the Albertans who still don't have a work due to low oil price from lacking pipelines.
4113 2018-12-03 17:33:44 Let's hope the dark $ of oil and gas industry doesn't sabotage this.
4114 2018-12-03 17:33:28 I am a Liberal supporter but this is very tone deaf for Justin Trudeau with Oil crisis in Alberta & Oshawa plant closing. Not a sound decision on his part
4115 2018-12-03 17:33:26 Snake oil??
4116 2018-12-03 17:33:21 That’s about as far fetched as Obama taking credit for our present economy and oil exploration!!

4122 2018-12-03 17:32:52 Applying lubricant on my skin, so that I easily slide through vent systems. I find that oil based works better. Tried coconut oil but it doesn’t last long enough and I have to reapply. Also it makes me break out.
4123 2018-12-03 17:32:46 What beard oil are you using?
4124 2018-12-03 17:32:17 When Americans protest, vote for politicians who aren't bought by oil & gas but support renewable energy instead, buy electric or plug-in hybrids instead of gas guzzling polluting SUVs & trucks,... Was that a rhetorical question? 
4125 2018-12-03 17:32:10 Get some mint essential oil and put a small bit on yout temples it works and its natural
4126 2018-12-03 17:32:08 Global oil demand is rising at 1 million bbl/d per year. Supply and demand are within 0.5% of each other.  Wood Mckenzie is forecasting supply shortfalls by 2025...
4127 2018-12-03 17:32:03 More oil will be pumped???
4128 2018-12-03 17:31:58 Lemme take u tuesday before movie
4129 2018-12-03 17:31:50 อือ
4130 2018-12-03 17:31:44 I need @mydrunkelephant luxury virgin marula oil back in my lifeeee. I’m not glowing !
4131 2018-12-03 17:31:44 The solution to Alberta’s price-gap crisis is not oil quotas. It’s pipelines, less red tape and lower taxes. 

And you can’t get pipelines  built by partnering with environmental groups, virtue signalling on climate change or offering political cover for new carbon taxes.
4132 2018-12-03 17:31:29 B*itch you want oil or not HAHAHAHAHAHA
4133 2018-12-03 17:31:24 I need a oil change 
4134 2018-12-03 17:31:20 Michael Babad, you're right. Notley's oil production cuts will put a dent in Canada's economic growth. It will also avoid a collapse of the Canadian oil industry. That may not be likely, but do you really want to take that chance? If prices recover, the cuts can be dropped.
4135 2018-12-03 17:31:20 I have to buy new tires/get my oil changed and buy christmas presents all before I leave and it’s stressing me out because I don’t have money 
4136 2018-12-03 17:31:14 And you believe the rise in oil taxes is related to a socialist movement?
4137 2018-12-03 17:31:11 False.  USA is the 3rd largest oil producer in the world.  Russia is first, Saudi Arabia is 2nd.  USA produces almost 40% of the oil it needs each year, the rest is imported from Canada, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela and Nigeria.
4138 2018-12-03 17:31:02 Qatar might leave opec and supply of oil will be on their terms they might increase supply thats means cheaper oil for these 2
4139 2018-12-03 17:30:57 Lol ok I will
4140 2018-12-03 17:30:52 What about dollar per barrel, no more money from crude oil again in as such no more free money, you better wake up
4141 2018-12-03 17:30:48 Hansen was WRONG when he said.....
“If we burn all reserves of oil, gas, and coal, there’s a substantial chance that we will initiate the runaway greenhouse. If we also burn the tar sands and tar shale, I believe the Venus syndrome is a dead certainty.”
He later recanted.
4142 2018-12-03 17:30:46 Except the Republican senators and establishment Democrats will let him get away with it.   Their lobbyists in oil and banking will insist.  Donald is the world's best distraction.  Oh and the ice caps are melting.

4144 2018-12-03 17:30:42 as someone who spent HOURS yesterday trying to re-adjust the settings for the Oil Paint brush in CSP bc I forgot to save my settings - the brushes *do* matter.

4145 2018-12-03 17:30:33 He's going to find out what it's like to lose 10% of the countries GDP that's what oil brings to Canada. It will effect our economy greatly. Nation wide jobs are being lost

4148 2018-12-03 17:30:12 Read the article. There's a difference between big oil and big banks and "the entire business sector in Scotland".
4149 2018-12-03 17:30:01 Oil companies know there is no reasonable alternative to oil. They go along and are willing to incur any expense they can pass on as long as they look good to the badly misinformed public and politicians.
4150 2018-12-03 17:29:55  have you tried applying Vitamin E or tea tree oil?
4151 2018-12-03 17:29:47 Anything with camomile, fennel or evening primrose oil eases symptoms. I use Shepard's purse and ladies mantle herbs and make into tea to ease heavy flow. The joy of being female

4154 2018-12-03 17:29:20 These are old farming methods, they do not depend on electricity or oil and grow crop for their won use first then sell excess. Who agitates don't do this kind of agriculture, they are business men with little knowledge on agriculture waiting for govt. to solve problems.
4155 2018-12-03 17:29:15 use Oil color☺︎

4157 2018-12-03 17:29:05 Qatar departure from OPEC circumventes US sanctions against Iran because the quantity of his exports is known via OPEC and he can export large quantities of Iranian oil in the name of the government of Qatar. This is all.

4173 2018-12-03 17:27:33 USA is still importing oil from Canada, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela and Nigeria. US oil drilling supplies roughly 40% of total US oil use.  There IS a large oil reserve in USA, and it is claimed entirely by the US military - trucks, tanks and planes need fuel.

4182 2018-12-03 17:26:58 @ea_amrita with oil in the 40s  wouldn't it be a shorter path to higher oil prices to push oil lower and  shut down the US drillers ?
4183 2018-12-03 17:26:53 "That muffin has OIL IN IT!"
4184 2018-12-03 17:26:49 You love nothing but money and attention. The farmers are getting tired of drinking your snake oil too. The ones that don’t hate your guts already, will soon enough. Tic tock goes the clock...
4185 2018-12-03 17:26:44 Suncor pumps oil, then refines it in Canada and retails the gas at its Petro-Canada outlets. Not only is the firm less tied to export markets,  it essentially sells the discounted oil to itself as an input, and then markets the output to consumers at full price.
4186 2018-12-03 17:26:23 Use baby oil!

4189 2018-12-03 17:25:55 Hi @ConsumerSOS, thanks for all you do for us viewers! Have you done a piece on how gas prices are (or aren't) linked to oil prices? Oil is at a modern low, but gas prices are not. Why is that?
4190 2018-12-03 17:25:55 You are tight. Men working in oil and gas are not buying soap at Lush. But their wives and daughters do. Or did. 

When you walk into their mall stores, you have no idea of their political leanings. All you see is scented soaps that women love.

Now, before you me tion "aolar for lights" read the article and fi d out how the backup batteries are charged.
You completely fell for Hudema's lie. And it's indicative of "green" actions, so you might also check oil related claims.

4195 2018-12-03 17:25:39 Thanks.
4196 2018-12-03 17:25:38 You think they don't use nickle in regular cars? Nothing in that article says it's as bad for the environment as oil production, genius. 

Climate change is destroying the world. It's completely impossible to do oil in a 'clean' way, because burning it what causes the problem.
4197 2018-12-03 17:25:36 TD weighs in on #Alberta #oil cuts: "At a first read, the direct impact be to reduce Canadian real GDP #growth in 2019 by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points, with only a partial recoup expected in 2020 of roughly 0.1pp." #cdnecon
4198 2018-12-03 17:25:35 The world faces a glut of oil due to overproduction.  Alberta has been warned for over a decade to slow development, because of this very eventuality.  Alberta produces oil that is in every way inferior quality to that produced in the us. But sure, blame the ndp. Ignore reality.

4215 2018-12-03 17:23:48 May actually be a very good move - all Alberta parties agreed to it.  This morning Western Can Select has jumped nearly $11 US to the low $30's US.  To think it was $10 US a week ago.  It is temporary, and with Line 3 and new oil trains due by late 2019 may prove a great success!

4253 2018-12-03 17:19:23 It's UK oil and we make up 8% of UK, simples really. We only get the tax revenue on any profit from extracted oil after production/staff/extraction costs. Any iScot would have decisions and negotiations  to have with the oil companies.
4254 2018-12-03 17:19:23 17 days after largest spill in NL history, and One Ocean—representing 'mutual interests' of @FFAW_Unifor & offshore oil companies—has yet to say a word. FFAW also hasn't been questioned about money paid to union by @CNLOPB & offshore oil companies. #nlpoli @TheBroadcastCBC
4255 2018-12-03 17:19:13 Ian Wood, away wi ye, ye traitor ye. Away and count your billions Scrooge McDuck! Oil and gas is your cash cow,  meanwhile the rest of us mere mortals get to use food banks. Clown shoes.
4256 2018-12-03 17:19:09 Ghana;
to impose taxes on anointing oil, stickers and other merchandise sold by churches and pastors.
Oya nah!
4257 2018-12-03 17:19:07 Lithium doesn't cause climate change, it doesn't cause environmental problems.  That's just oil company propaganda they pump out in order to keep people from thinking there's any solution, or an excuse not to do anything.
4258 2018-12-03 17:19:03 Cathy, you’re right. The original 7-branched menorah was in the ancient Temple, and some people do still light their Shabbat candles in a similar one. The 9-branched Hanukkiyah commemorates the 8-day “miracle of the oil” when the Temple was rededicated by the Maccabees.

4260 2018-12-03 17:18:52 The Saudis have a decision to make given Russia's reluctance to cut. They can shoulder a larger cut themselves or wait for oil to fall to a level at which Russia will be willing to cut more. #OOTT
4261 2018-12-03 17:18:51 BEcause we dont have enough oil and too many fish?
4262 2018-12-03 17:18:45 In my mind, if the US Gov't does studies on CBD/hemp oil & found it beneficial & allow it to be sold then there is not a reason to legalize marijuana.  So the Gov't probably won't research the oil. Pot is helpful for epilepsy, chronic pain & so much more!
4263 2018-12-03 17:18:43 “I love your hair! what products do you use?”

water.maybe some coconut oil if I’m feeling fancy.
4264 2018-12-03 17:18:17 It is now i understand BH has been technically defeated.
The new insurgence we fighting is ISWAP who came in to render support for the degraded Boko Haram
4265 2018-12-03 17:18:15 Increased holding in Diversified Oil & Gas after todays trading statement "Results for the year ended 31 December 2018 are expected to be materially ahead of current market expectations"

4267 2018-12-03 17:18:04 おやすみなさい。
4268 2018-12-03 17:17:58 Hannukah teaches us that we should descend into civil war if needed to continue using oil rather than transitioning to a renewable energy source so yes Happy Holidays
4269 2018-12-03 17:17:55 That’s simply not true, we are the third largest oil reserve in the world.  We could eventually produce enough to fill all the pipelines.  This includes EE which was essentially killed by the Liberals when they added the downstream emissions piece

4273 2018-12-03 17:17:47 Years of conservative  mismanagement of oil resources that should have been used for the benefit of Alberta citizens instead all Alberta has is a huge liability for the clean up reclamation costs are going to be huge . That rests directly at the feet of conservatives.
4274 2018-12-03 17:17:23 語尾やろなぁ
4275 2018-12-03 17:17:19 Except it is a direct tax on diesel and a bit less on petrol. The govt has agreed it will be a sliding tax so that the price at the pumps stays relatively stable compared to fluctuations in oil prices. Got to start somewhere if we want a cleaner environment
4276 2018-12-03 17:17:18 Na wa oh but I believe human capital is the next oil in Nigeria . whilst I understand the harshness of the environment while blinds people to see the opportunities, I believe this  would be the main economic driver soonest
4277 2018-12-03 17:17:07 I have that in oil form :D it's my fav aswell!
4278 2018-12-03 17:16:52 I will say that when I got a parasite the digise* sp. is the only oil that touched my pain, and eucalyptus has prevented me from going to the hospital a few times while having a flare up. I’m not an oil nut by any means but they have helped my complex health issues
4279 2018-12-03 17:16:51 @BAP_Bangyongguk @BAP_Himchan @BAP_Daehyun @BAP_Youngjae @BAP_Jongup @ZELO96 Goodnight ja 
4280 2018-12-03 17:16:42 I am ridiculously excited for my lunch to get here. It's just angel hair with garlic and olive oil, but I have been craving this since last night.
4281 2018-12-03 17:16:34 So delightfully enjoyable to know that Hillary Clinton is cursing and muttering each time the media says George Bush 41 was most qualified ever for President.  Just a sheer joy to know she might start to realize how unlikeable she is/was to American public.  @HillaryClinton
4282 2018-12-03 17:16:32 No wonder, Abajo money scarce for Nigeria, so its your mummy that's bn hiding money inside kolo  oya bring it here lets check the serial number.
4283 2018-12-03 17:16:17 Wtf, this re-writing of history is ludicrous. Oil interests drove this supposed stable team into starting a war we have never gotten out of.
4284 2018-12-03 17:16:16 @thenutmegteam what percentage of funds do you have supporting fossil fuel based companies? E.g. oil & gas, coal.
4285 2018-12-03 17:16:13 The Street would def agree with you although this is a bizarre and unfortunate situation for Canadian oil. Short-term solution????
4286 2018-12-03 17:15:59 Drank a litre of blackseed oil my throat is gone
4287 2018-12-03 17:15:58 Canada has an almost $700 billion debt.  The antiquated oil pipeline Trudeau promised to build Alberta is going to cost Canadian taxpayers at least $10 billion by completion. 45% of our household income goes toward paying tax. We can not afford more spending.
4288 2018-12-03 17:15:47 GAS  HAPPENS  NATURALLY IN THE REFINEMENT  OF THE  SHITTE  INTO   OIL U SET UR   FARMERS UP  RITE  ABOVE  BOARD  AND EVERYONE  WINS THE GAS  FROM THEIR MANURE PITS  SHOULD BE  RUNNING THEIR  FARM
4289 2018-12-03 17:15:32 so is this it? The fed and the "trade deal" come to the rescue and the markets go up a few %?   LMAO.  Who is going to buy now that it looks like shorts are done covering and stock buybacks are taking a backseat to debt buybacks. btw I was bullish on oil for a day and a half.  
4290 2018-12-03 17:15:32 Not that a food I can't live without, but my favorites are oil pasta and any kind of nuts.

4292 2018-12-03 17:15:20 I’m a female who has worked in the Alberta oilfields for 23 years and I’ve always been treated with respect by every level of worker out there, male or female.  Until you’ve walked a mile in my shoes you have no right to criticize Alberta oil workers!
4293 2018-12-03 17:15:19 Use fry light instead of oil on roasties
4294 2018-12-03 17:15:17 Oil barbs
4295 2018-12-03 17:15:15 I don’t see any difference between Putin and any G7 leader,my only problem with him is climate change,a climate change agreement is bad for oil business.
4296 2018-12-03 17:15:07 Actually you might want to take your own advice. Seriously dig into the Bush family history.  Tip it goes back to his father & Hitler plus banking scams, oil plots, JFK assassination, CIA corruption, insurance scams & a long list of other things. Can't forget "Poppy" fields & war
4297 2018-12-03 17:15:03 やぞ
4298 2018-12-03 17:15:02 The only way to stop this is with force, reluctantly; or remove their capacity to pump oil and sell it.
4299 2018-12-03 17:14:59 Tory mouthpiece believes...lost all respect for the man when he deliberately lied about oil reserves during referendum.

4301 2018-12-03 17:14:42 ING Bank: mix of recovering risk appetite & higher #oilprices puts #NOK, #AUD & #NZD (and to a less degree CAD) into the G10 FX sweet spot. In #EmergingMarkets space, #ZAR, #COP & #CLP are best placed to benefit.  However, higher oil prices don't mean a sustainably higher $EURUSD
4302 2018-12-03 17:14:25 May explain why there’s so much interest in stacking up investments on the back of oil/gas exploration in/around the Gulf of Guinea
4303 2018-12-03 17:14:09 Heavy rain pour, the 2nd day already (still much better than having this as snow, imo at least). Possibly could be even enough to significantly rise Rhine rivers water levels. I just wonder if prices at gas stations then finally would drop a little, or if the oil companies...
4304 2018-12-03 17:14:09 So we defeated Bokoharam, their dislodged brothers from the middle east and other parts of the world wants to pull this country down, may #ISWAP and their sponsors know no peace.
4305 2018-12-03 17:14:04 I watched the interview. Not sure what he forecasted about oil. He sounded very confused.

4310 2018-12-03 17:13:49 are you kidding me? it ramped up
it doesn't have to be literal ownership of land, imperialism can be done through businesses too
remember when we went to war in south america for fruit companies?
or how oil extraction happens in the middle east
4311 2018-12-03 17:13:42 @TheDemCoalition Senator Manchin, a fossil fuel puppet, accepted $965,288 from the coal, oil, and gas industries in his Senate career. DON"T make him the Ranking Democrat on the Energy & Natural Resources Committee. He denies Climate Change research  DO BETTER..
4312 2018-12-03 17:13:41 Since you have been in office, the world is chaotic. Greed, dishonesty has no place in the world. Your lust to drill for oil is killing our oceans. Food and interest rates have skyrocketed. You are not a very nice man. You care only about yourself. Bush is being buried & u tweet.
4313 2018-12-03 17:13:23 I know i can’t score well in oil and gas, material science yet im still procrastinating.
4314 2018-12-03 17:13:17 But Tyler, oil prices are so low how could anything go wrong?
4315 2018-12-03 17:13:14 If your man works the oil fields and is angry about calls to protect women working in the oil field, your man is doing terrible things out in the oil field.
4316 2018-12-03 17:13:07 Your so right Hillary would have let in every illegal and would have sold the country to the highest bidder just like obummer did I can’t see that black  unemployment is the lowest in history and we are one of the biggest oil importers!!!There’s not enough room wake up Fool
4317 2018-12-03 17:13:06 Qatar wants to be out of OPEC control, so it can hlep Iran to sell its oil under Qatar name with  large quantities ..

4320 2018-12-03 17:12:55 I was there Saturday. Had fun and good time, since my alma mater won. But too many of the drinking establishments close to Lucas Oil are bro bars (Brothers, Kilroy’s). Slippery Noodle wasn’t ridiculously crowded before the game. Later or no closing time always gives NOLA the nod.
4321 2018-12-03 17:12:49 I’ve been putting off getting an oil change for so long I actually had a dream about it

4324 2018-12-03 17:12:39 Ah I see, all you have left is conspiracy theories. Must be why the oil companies are investing in renewables.

4327 2018-12-03 17:12:14 2 more hikes from BofC, then we'll hear some jibber-jabber about achieving the 'neutral rate' amid this 'WCS oil crisis' narrative, then 'mission accomplished', etc., but this is just to get to a level where they have some room to lower rates once the next recession starts.
4328 2018-12-03 17:12:06 Just bought 307$ of oil. Just enough to do 4 oil changes
4329 2018-12-03 17:11:41 Our bi-monthly Industry Insider newsletter highlights events and news about a specific sector that relies on #manufacturing.

4335 2018-12-03 17:11:26 Yeah if you weren't out by September, it was too late. I'm up about 3% on everything I've bought since about end of October. Also up 3% on $CVX $PXD I bought middle of last week when oil had a hard bounce, just below $50. Well see if it's wiped out again by end of week.

4340 2018-12-03 17:10:46 Yes. The Tories & others need 2 sow the seeds of doubt early against any new Indy Ref & deflect from Brexit chaos. Be interesting what the new messages will be. Would folk still buy the Pension or oil scare story now? For me they'd love to undermine Nicola with some smear story
4341 2018-12-03 17:10:44 There is a term for that: addiction. Just because that’s true today doesn’t mean it will stay that way. The early industrial revolution used water wheels & whale oil. Then later we switched to fossil fuels. Time to switch again. Our survival depends on it.
4342 2018-12-03 17:10:43 Thanks for "clearing the air" on the oil/gas industry running our state & now our universities. Harold Hamm and David Boren ran off two OU seismologists after they issued a report blaming injection wells for OK earthquakes. They had to meeting w Hamm & Boren for a lecture first.

Think of a rusty lock that is persistently difficult to open due to the rust.
Someone may decide to use a bit of oil or grease on the lock to help it open and shut more smoothly
4347 2018-12-03 17:10:13 I’m thinking about the hwy between Anchorage and Fairbanks being out and wondering how long before they run into a heating oil transport issue in the interior 
4348 2018-12-03 17:10:09 Well, it’s refreshing to see people at least try this as a competitive advantage. Will DB run an ad excoriating oil sheikhdoms some time?

4360 2018-12-03 17:08:38 Did we sacrifice Alberta jobs for central Canada jobs by canceling energy east to buy Saudi oil so they'd buy armoured vehicles? Something feels a little off.
4361 2018-12-03 17:08:37 Yes, awful Canadian oil and awful Mexican avacados ruining USA. Last I checked many Latin American immigrants work in US agriculture, I'm sure you will love higher food prices. Seriously, DPRK, Trump. If you read anything, which looks like you didn't, this is DPRK playbook 101.
4362 2018-12-03 17:08:36 It was thought our heavy oil would supply an oil depleted US market, the shale revolution not only lost us a customer, we gained a fierce competitor.

4364 2018-12-03 17:08:02 Of course, the issue here is oil and construction workers only go to these towns to pillage and rape. Such Neanderthals we are. You know, we actually get 3 day seminar on how to behave in that manner.

4379 2018-12-03 17:06:44 Alberta is in an oil crisis, thousands of pple are losing their jobs in Ontario and the PM is pledging 50m to Trevor Noah (love him btw) on twitter.  Forgot the fact that its our barrowed $ he is pledging, it lookd terrible politically.  Scheer must be loving this.
4380 2018-12-03 17:06:37 Eddie, use your head mate. Macron is the male equivalent of Hillary, and he's showing what a Neo-Lib that he is. Oil prices are down, and yet he's taxing the daylights out of his people. It's affecting people in rural communities (about 60% of the population. Hence the reaction!
4381 2018-12-03 17:06:37 Since the creation of this state, no governor has done what Governor Udom has done to take Akwa Ibom beyond oil. The Syringe industries, the metering industry , The flour mill
4382 2018-12-03 17:06:31 Dear Co-op food. I might be encouraged to suggest some worthy people to receive a pack if you had removed all palm oil/fat from your foods. When will you do this?
4383 2018-12-03 17:06:26 Jay took me to class this morning so I could study for my test on the way there and while he was waiting on me to get out he took my car to get an oil change and got my car washed. I. Love. This. Man. 
4384 2018-12-03 17:06:26 I have to take a test, get an oil change & go to the nail salon before I have work at 4 lol
4385 2018-12-03 17:06:11 I luuv canned tuna. In olive oil. With a little mustard. Mwah! (imagine two fingers and thumb together against my lips simultaneous with the sound effect)
4386 2018-12-03 17:06:10 I got your intent but still chuckled at “derp fried” like they were chucking these into oil as fast as possible
4387 2018-12-03 17:05:55 ...and the oil prices crashing very loudly...the same thing goes with Iran and Russia, that is why the need the OPEC cartel to cut production to push the price up, you now, communist don't believe in demand/offer but only when they need it....hypocrites
4388 2018-12-03 17:05:54 Hash oil is more appropriate.
4389 2018-12-03 17:05:54 That includes donations from employees of the oil and gas industry, of which there are many in Texas.
4390 2018-12-03 17:05:53 Apparently, it’s got a name! I read today that it’s called ‘purpose-based advertising’. The Iceland orangutan / palm oil festive ad is a good example of this trend, which targets “a younger ‘woke’ generation (that) puts societal value above value for money”.
#WokeOfAges
4391 2018-12-03 17:05:42 The rabbis didn’t love the origins of Chanukah, partly because the Maccabees became a dynasty that kinda sorta betrayed Israel in the end. Hence the religious focus on the miracle of the oil burning long.
4392 2018-12-03 17:05:37 What is OPEC?
OPEC was founded in 1960 by Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, five major oil-producing countries, but Qatar announced on Monday it was leaving the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries(OPEC), the world's leading oil producing bloc.
4393 2018-12-03 17:05:25 @Bubba_Trading sir you always talk about gold and oil. What is your view on silver which is poor men's gold
4394 2018-12-03 17:05:24 #fillyourstockings #enchantedbynature Spa Of The World Hawaiian Kukui I have 3 big tubs of, Japanese Camellia I have 2 big tubs of, Brazilian Cupuacu scrub I have 2 tubs of & Tahitian Tiaré shower oil & Adriatic Peony shower cream! I have one of each! 
4395 2018-12-03 17:05:24 Simply put, our conventional reserves much like in the US were thought to be in decline, and the oil sands weren't truly viable until the early 2000s. More pipelines weren't needed decades ago. Shale and $100 oil made that happen.
4396 2018-12-03 17:05:22 George W. Bush criticized the Trump administration’s immigration policies during a speech in the new digital town square. What would have happened if we had invaded Saudi Arabia, taken their oil, and used money to build roads, public trans, fiber optics, and top
4397 2018-12-03 17:05:21 Carbon tax to pay for health care?

How are we going to pay to stop global warming?

Global warming is snake oil on steroids.
4398 2018-12-03 17:05:04 Depends on the refinery and additives. Also many countries subsidize cost of diesel fuel by slightly overcharging petrol. 
Good job on the Veg oil. In US and Brazil they mix 15% ethanol made from corn/cane (but the ethanol production needs natural gas based fertilizer)
4399 2018-12-03 17:04:55 They also don't invade for oil. Oh wait.
4400 2018-12-03 17:04:52 Me: Goodm-

• Unfettered capitalism
• Guns/nukes

4404 2018-12-03 17:04:44 Yes Alberta Oil instead of foreign Oil. Makes sense to me......
4405 2018-12-03 17:04:24 @Roe50 what concerns me is that  Israel has an abundance of natural gas and oil. Russia makes the majority of its income providing the Middle East with gas and oil. They don’t like competition maybe they will join Iran in taking it over.
4406 2018-12-03 17:04:20 Vegetable oil I guess 
4407 2018-12-03 17:04:14 Lmao easy. We ain’t all oil of Olay
4408 2018-12-03 17:04:11 what you saw was nothing more than the barrel of oil at an average of $100 for more than 8-months and producing around 3MM barrels/day, now the production is around 1MM barrel/day because he didn't invest in maintenance of oil refineries but on his political agenda of freebies
4409 2018-12-03 17:04:11 hello rae I have recently become an obsessive consumer of face stuffs and here is where i’ve landed (i see others suggesting some of these): Good Genes (as you ment'd), Kiehl's Midnight Recovery Concentrate, and Drunk Elephant Virgin Marula Oil (which owns)
4410 2018-12-03 17:04:11 Especially when the USA puts an embargo on your ass and floods the world market with oil.
4411 2018-12-03 17:04:06 Yet another regulatory failing. If fatigue is an issue, stop studying and change the rules. And thanks CBC for taking something that has been under study since 2011 and making it all about oil, which as we know represents 100% of all rail cargo in Canada
4412 2018-12-03 17:03:58 Much foreign aid is tied to trade.  "Here's money, Tanzania -- but buy your oil from us."  Read, before tweeting your Conservative nonsense.
4413 2018-12-03 17:03:56 Don’t worry you can have all your pennies to yourself soon and scotland will take care of her own oil revenues enjoy your blindfold brexit
4414 2018-12-03 17:03:53 So maybe they shouldn't tax their people and their means of energy so high.... Glad trump got us out of that hot mess as we move to 3rd largest oil producers
4415 2018-12-03 17:03:40 I actually use a body oil, because deoderants and antiperspirants do something weird with my body chem that causes a sharp, unpleasant smell within 2 hours. I either use nothing (and have a mild sweaty smell 24~ hours later) or the oil... which I don't usually sniff. lol
4416 2018-12-03 17:03:39 If I have any recommendations to all my fellow curly haired people it’s: Do coconut oil treatments!!!! Even if it’s just once a month! It realllly makes my curls sooo soft and shiny, I try to do it 2-3 times a week.
4417 2018-12-03 17:03:36 @T_Mason_H, are the U.S. oil inventories data released on Wednesday as usual or postponed? Thanks!
4418 2018-12-03 17:03:29 I am little concern that government is getting involved with cut. Premier should be working with oil companies to see what is best to do.
4419 2018-12-03 17:03:16 We see you Wood. Oil and fisheries are making you wealthy, so just you chum up to your political pals and keep everything just how you like it.
4420 2018-12-03 17:03:14 I have respect for our oil and gas workers who work hard everyday to put food on the table for their families. They don’t deserve to be labelled as rapists by our grouper Prime Minister.
4421 2018-12-03 17:03:13 UPDATE: Production at Husky Energy's SeaRose is still shut down more than two weeks after the November 16th oil spill of 250K litres. The failed flow line connector has not yet been recovered. No further damage detected. Investigation into the spill continues. @CBCNL @CBCNews
4422 2018-12-03 17:03:09 He's like the lead singer of Midnight Oil's twin from the evil dimension.
4423 2018-12-03 17:03:05 disband oil companies, prosecute oil executives, raise taxes, ration fossil fuels, build green infrastructure, maintain nuclear, subsidize renewable, reduce disenfranchisement, demand journalistic responsibility, respect indigenous rights, increase equity, realize justice.
4424 2018-12-03 17:02:57 The @FA are an absolute joke for charging #klopp double standard going on. Just because we are not oil rich and can’t bribe you to drop charges
4425 2018-12-03 17:02:50 Why is getting your oil changed so expensive 
4426 2018-12-03 17:02:39 I swear white men no NOTHING about cars..dude said do said do I need an oil change if he at half a tank  i shouldve hung up at that point!
4427 2018-12-03 17:02:39 Qatar is leaving OPEC Jan 1. Qatar was the 1st to join in 1961, now 1st Middle Eastern Nation to leave. What will that do to oil prices?  Who’s next.
4428 2018-12-03 17:02:26 no, you dont understand, when 80-90% of the GDP comes from oil qand the budget of the country is based on an oil price, yes it affects and a lot...that's why I say chavez was like the magician of oz hiding behind a curtain of petro-dollars...
4429 2018-12-03 17:02:21 Yes. He is now representing Ingawa - Kusada at the Federal House.
4430 2018-12-03 17:02:16 Qatar is leaving OPEC Jan 1. Qatar was the 1st to join in 1961, now 1st Middle Eastern Nation to leave. What will that do to oil prices?  Who’s next?

4433 2018-12-03 17:02:02 She’s explaining how olive oil is made , compressed olives between cheese clothes. I chime in “when is the virgin slaughtered?”
4434 2018-12-03 17:02:00 I don't know enough to comment whether the halting of production of oil in Alberta is right, but it is clear there was much consultation with those who have more knowledge than I do. 

But I'm impressed with Premier Notley.
4435 2018-12-03 17:01:59 Would you eat food grown with treated fracking waste water? "Fracking requires a huge amount of water... but New Mexico thinks it can mitigate that problem by pushing oil companies to treat and recycle fracking waste water for use in agriculture — or  even as  drinking water."
4436 2018-12-03 17:01:49 $VISTA oil -16%
4437 2018-12-03 17:01:41 Seems like the liberals have all but forgot the "war monger", "corrupt big oil" amongst other labels that were once tied to #41. Social memory changes like the wind.... And who ever is pushing the narrative at the time.
4438 2018-12-03 17:01:40 If Qatar truly sees tension between being in OPEC and focusing on gas, its biggest move could be to abandon oil indexation in its contracts. It can adopt an existing marker or, better yet, develop a new LNG price, FOB in Ras Laffan. That will help gas finally break free from oil.
4439 2018-12-03 17:01:38 I have anointing oil and tools for documenting.  I’m blessed to be with my sister @brittanydare  as well as @Increasemather1.

4442 2018-12-03 17:01:35 Amazing how the Liberal plan shut down plants in the US as well as lowering world oil prices.
4443 2018-12-03 17:01:34 Their irrelevant. All or nothing is their mantra. Sorry don't believe you have to kill the economy to help the earth. It's called technology and innovation to make oil etc safer for the environment. And making oil companies pay for a big chunk of it. Saved jobs and many created
4444 2018-12-03 17:01:32 If I had a nickel for every essential oil I was told to try...

4447 2018-12-03 17:01:27 No, your unelectable corporate queen is the reason we have Trump. Why run a candidate who was disliked just as much as Trump? The days of corporate controlled candidates is over. No more Wall St, fossil fuel, big bank, big oil, ect... funded candidates. They will not be elected!

4454 2018-12-03 17:01:05 Happy to see a younger generation taking part in politics. Even more satisfied with the fact the younger generation is understating the machines that oil the parts.
4455 2018-12-03 17:01:04 What essential oil scent do you love in your home during the holiday season?
4456 2018-12-03 17:01:04 $CPG up on the day because, you know, it's such a big WCS player...
Proof the market largely has no clue what it buys or sells.
CPG does not produce WCS, does not sell at Hardisty, does not (materially) produce from AB, and is not an "oil sands" company.
But, whatevs...
4457 2018-12-03 17:00:52 There's plenty of refining capacity in New Brunswick which could eliminate Saudi oil in the east if TRUDEAU HADN'T KILLED ENERGY EAST!! The oil would be flowing as we speak,  making Canada self sufficient and enabling exports to Europe.
4458 2018-12-03 17:00:47 *whispers* I actually like canned tuna but only the kind in olive oil
4459 2018-12-03 17:00:46 Christmas time is around the corner and oil marketers want to start this madness to create untold hardship to Nigerians by way of fuel scarcity abi? God'll punish all enemies of the people. I hope FGN will forestall it...
4460 2018-12-03 17:00:39 The models would probably look fine if they weren't drenched in the "Unreal Engine body oil".
4461 2018-12-03 17:00:35 Maybe Canadians should set up a blockade on Saudi oil! That might make the idiot-in-charge rethink he ludicrous position on pipelines of clean, ethical Canadian oil.

4471 2018-12-03 16:59:52 Agree, but I would bet that AOC probably supports ending coal and oil jobs, implementing reasonable gun control measures, and ensuring women have control of their bodies, and there are probably some vocal 'average, working-class voters' that aren't happy about that.
4472 2018-12-03 16:59:49 Big oil and gas donors should help!

4474 2018-12-03 16:59:40 In the end we are doing fine without you, why would we risk the status quo by having a much much larger economy enter? What tangible advantage would that have? We cant pump more oil nor fish more fish than we do, we're running at capacity.
4475 2018-12-03 16:59:39 EVERYTHING EU claims - the opposite is True. Left Wing unaccountable EU Commissioners want EU Army (& consume UK Military via EU Laws). They will go to war - Germany depends on Soviet Oil & Gas. Nationalists want the opposite - Repatriation of SOVEREIGNTY
4476 2018-12-03 16:59:39 A good fun thing to do while you are getting an oil change is read tweets from Bulls fans who want Thibs back now that Fred H has been fired.

4480 2018-12-03 16:58:57 The production of plastic uses around eight percent of the world's oil production (bioplastics are not a good solution as they require food source crops). Annually approximately 500 billion plastic bags are used worldwide. More than one million bags are used every minute.

4486 2018-12-03 16:58:32 It has been brought to our attention that at approximately 9:13 last night, a suspect covered in baby oil passed out in a ditch after flashing multiple pedestrians. We apologize, and Mayor O’Harris has been returned to his home safely.

4490 2018-12-03 16:58:22 You do understand what is happening to Cdns right now right? Factories in Ont are closing and ABs are heavily effected by the low price of oil and Trudeau is still giving MILLIONS away to foreign countries to help them instead of his own country.

4497 2018-12-03 16:57:23 That's the trouble with health insurance; people want something that pays for EVERYTHING. Imagine what your car insurance would cost if you wanted oil changes and tire rotations covered, as well as pre-existing conditions like a smashed-in rear end. /End

4504 2018-12-03 16:57:06 You know the struggle is real when you bring your car in for an oil change and explicitly say to the mechanic “Ignore the sounds and other things you may notice while under there. Just the oil today. Maybe the tire. It’s a shit show!”

4506 2018-12-03 16:56:41 We always have money for war. We always have money to protect the interest of the donors.

That reminds me, can we pretend Honduras has oil so we can stop the reason the caravan came up here in the first place?  Pretend that Flint has oil too and find money to fix their water?
4507 2018-12-03 16:56:41 EEeehh ! no internet :(
so busy has to go to Palm Oil Plantation again for MSPO .
4508 2018-12-03 16:56:31 Contains Palm Oil. Contributes to species extinctions. Human cousins, bonobos specifically. DON'T BUY.
4509 2018-12-03 16:56:25 People remain indifferent while they are despoiled of thousands of years' worth of cultural and human heritage, yet they take to the streets when their oil bill becomes too high. Westerners have no aspiration and nothing at all to defend other than their monthly income.
4510 2018-12-03 16:56:12 I just learned that the fashion industry is the second largest polluter after oil. #surprised #notsurprised
4511 2018-12-03 16:55:58 How about make positive steps to build pipeline. Come on now this is another step in the shut down of oil industry. No hope of removals.

4513 2018-12-03 16:55:46 What we've probably done is severely limited the chances of anything else reaching our level of tech development, assuming similar capabilities. We've mined out a lot of the easy stuff and oil takes a long time to occur. OTOH we've created new "deposits" of alloys, so who knows.
4514 2018-12-03 16:55:29 talking of pension, who reformed the pension scheme? who deregulated the telecome industry? who reformed our banks? who created institutions like @officialEFCC AND @ICPC? who paid off our debts that are climbing now again? who had the best oil prices? the roads? tell me abt @APC

4516 2018-12-03 16:55:11 I'd amend Single payer to Medicare for All.  They are using terminology to confuse the issue.  Still trying to favor the Insurance Companies over peoples health.  Change the oil in taxpayers.
4517 2018-12-03 16:55:11 Also tbh i have this sample night oil from sephora ans since using it all of my pimples have vanished and im considering dropping $110 on oil. OIL.
4518 2018-12-03 16:55:10 Pudge do you remember me I got your autograph in 1991 at the Six Flags Mall Dillard's on a cologne card and it smelled like flowers and Oil Can Boyd
4519 2018-12-03 16:55:05 hey  I pointed that out years ago the the party in power I said build the refineries on the oil sands keep all the mess in one place, if there is a leak they can fix and reuse.   crickets I hear crickets;
4520 2018-12-03 16:55:04 How about putting that money to directly help the mothers, wives and daughters of oil workers in #Alberta? #yeg #ymm #yyc
4521 2018-12-03 16:54:53 #NEW: Here’s what we know about Scott Shuttle Services: 
- Four USDOT inspections over the past two years 
- Two of those inspections involved minor violations for oil leaks & inoperable tail lamp
- Company hasn’t been been in any deadly crashes over past two years

4522 2018-12-03 16:54:49 El barril de petróleo descendió su valor un 30% en los últimos dos meses con un dólar también bajando. YPF baja un 1% la nafta y sube el gas oil. Que opinas?
4523 2018-12-03 16:54:46 Honestly, this is the only place I go to for an oil change. – bij Nine Minute Oil & Lube
4524 2018-12-03 16:54:46 Last night my bad, drew me a hot bath, 10 for 35 Vickies, & massaged me with some oil. We both had a great start to our week.
4525 2018-12-03 16:54:44 Main reason I rarely have vegan junk is that so much of it is made with coconut oil.
4526 2018-12-03 16:54:43 If George H.W. Bush was the president of a Middle Eastern nation and did to us what he did to them in pursuit of oil, he'd be the most hated man in American history. Americans speaking about his "greatness" is a testament to our blind nationalism, not his value or merit.
4527 2018-12-03 16:54:41 I gotta get my oil changed 
4528 2018-12-03 16:54:41 i have broken 

all the essential oil diffusers 

in this house 

forgive me 

they were so breakable

and so warm
4529 2018-12-03 16:54:30 lol, grow up and get a clue. Nobody wants your worthless tar oil.
4530 2018-12-03 16:54:18 Kalau nk start dr awal, mana nk try first? Sunscreen atau cleanser atau moisturizer atau cleansing oil?
4531 2018-12-03 16:54:12 I've tried tape and ear weights sadly. For some reason the PTE tape freaked my ears out and the ear weights ended up not working. I'm gonna just try for a dead stretch with vitamin e oil. My ears have been this size for about 5 months now so they should be ok
4532 2018-12-03 16:54:05 why do youn think that when the oil prices plunges these types of economies suffer so much? if it where like that guy says then they shouldn't be worried at all at the price of oil....and that's what goes on in diversified economies with a strong private sector...not Venezuela

4534 2018-12-03 16:54:05 AUD Tests Resistance on Trade War Truce, CAD and Oil Surges - US Market Open: AUD outperforms as President Trump and Xi call a truce. Canadian oil production cuts boost CAD. GBP remains plagued by Brexit concerns.
4535 2018-12-03 16:54:04 Sadly, it's 100% true!
That quote from Trump RE China's air killed me. Guess he hasn't seen the before & after pic of L.A. Yet, look at Beijing.
& why would we lose trillions? What we'll lose in oil, we'll gain in green energy jobs etc. But like u said, oil is all that matters!
4536 2018-12-03 16:54:02 Aww 1999. One year out. How big was the fan base back then? All red before the oil money.
4537 2018-12-03 16:53:50 I need this! I still need to figure out CBD oil... I'm behind the times!
4538 2018-12-03 16:53:48 It’s been a week since Obama claimed credit for America’s booming oil production, and not a single environmental group has criticized him.
4539 2018-12-03 16:53:39 lol, grow up and get a clue. Nobody wants your worthless tar oil.
4540 2018-12-03 16:53:32 Let's hope for an update from R1/R2  this week, to keep the market in the loop as they progress deeper.
4541 2018-12-03 16:53:31 If you say the truth for once, you'll not die.
4542 2018-12-03 16:53:25 Qatar one the smallest oil producers in the Gulf, just 600k barrels and producing at maximum capacity
4543 2018-12-03 16:53:18 This is big oil paying the US to lease offshore blocks for wind power. No tax payer handout needed, green capitalism at its finest.
4544 2018-12-03 16:53:16 My granddad was a coal miner & Baba's house still had a coal chute, altho her furnace had been converted to oil or gas.  A lump of coal doesn't have much of a smell, but a coal *town* sure does, & yes it rubs off...You got black dust all over yourself just walking around town.
4545 2018-12-03 16:53:07 And what did Harper do to prepare the country for the new economy?  Darn business cycles.  Oil up, oil down.  Everywhere you look.
4546 2018-12-03 16:53:06 y’all — oil does NOT moisturize your hair!
4547 2018-12-03 16:53:03 lol, no, it lies at the feet of nobody wants garbage tar oil.
4548 2018-12-03 16:53:00 And there plan to shut fown oil on Canada has started.
4549 2018-12-03 16:52:58 Every country which is under US sanction is suffering, eg Iran, venezuela.. apa vane oil but mmm maone. China yakatozotaura na Trump becoz mmm
4550 2018-12-03 16:52:51 Personally, 2 dozen carrots with my roast would only just be enough. However, you can spice/oil them to taste and bake them in the oven too.
4551 2018-12-03 16:52:48 Gotta get some good oil. Gotta be like $50 for like 20 minutes. Unless you’re giving a full body, ain’t nobody lasting longer than that lol

4553 2018-12-03 16:52:35 You could swap the oil for #frylight and then enjoy this on #Slimmingworld @swwalney
4554 2018-12-03 16:52:32 They're not supposed to be for POCs, that's the problem w/ your thinking. It's supposed to be equal opportunity, treating no different; not special interest. Looking out for things that pertain to POC is no different than voting solely on NRA, Big Oil, or other special interest.
4555 2018-12-03 16:51:57 Oh I am sorry...
WTF gave  you the impression that I thought Big Oil was incapable of recognizing tax payer handout?
4556 2018-12-03 16:51:56 It could happen...it’s Scotland’s oil? It won’t happen currently because Westminster is absolutely ruthless and is bleeding us dry....but....when we’re independent we can address the problem

4559 2018-12-03 16:51:46 Under his fine work AlQueda was established trained, financed and promoted send out to kill. Under his Presidency Saddam was installed to attack Iran. What is it what makes this man famous? Its Oil money.

4564 2018-12-03 16:51:21 Getting oil change.
4565 2018-12-03 16:51:20 She KNEW he was married with 2 kids, should have never got involved
4566 2018-12-03 16:51:15 Wars  have been for oil, mineral wealth, attacking countries that would have the temerity to not follow American hegemony. and the appropriation of land. The poor, who have little choice, always carry the burden of the deaths and mutilations. Off with your cant.
4567 2018-12-03 16:51:13 Does it have coconut oil?
4568 2018-12-03 16:51:10 I ada nk buat preloved muji oil cleanser & banila co balm cleanser. Sape berminat boleh DM je ok 
4569 2018-12-03 16:51:03 Or sometimes tossed in a ponzu-chili oil dressing.
4570 2018-12-03 16:51:03 Hell yea. Turmeric, C, E, and fish oil. Rhodiola if I feel depressed too long
4571 2018-12-03 16:51:01 ...we source our palm oil from a sustainable supplier who are members of the RSPO. They're based in Colombia where orangutans are not native species & no deforestation has occurred to in order for palm oil to be produced for Organix. We hope this helps.
4572 2018-12-03 16:51:01 壮絶な争いに負けてしまった故、

(訳:マミーとの口論に負け風呂入った)
4573 2018-12-03 16:50:49 Thanks. We're v.aware of issues surrounding palm oil & careful consideration is given to the use of it in our foods. No plans at mo to reduce but the safety of our foods is top priority & we carry out extensive research & assessments on all the ingredients we use in our foods....
4574 2018-12-03 16:50:36 If a lapdog like Mulroney says it's a good idea it's probably going to smack us on the nose with a rolled-up newspaper repeatedly.
4575 2018-12-03 16:50:31 Stopping/slowing Alberta's tar sands production is beneficial because the crude is so energy intensive, but that effort has zero impact on US/global consumption/production of oil products.
4576 2018-12-03 16:50:27 Good question. But what can we give up really? The Feds control our fishery, the oil companies control our oil, and the mining companies control our minerals. I think the Federal Government will simply print the money, and pay for the works, and the public may never even know.
4577 2018-12-03 16:50:26 You made a mess of that wrapping like you've made a mess of the rainforests. You should be wrapping up all ties with Dirty Palm Oil. Give the Orangutans and the rest of the world a Christmas presents and stop using Dirty Palm Oil by the end of this year. #DitchDirtyPalmOil
4578 2018-12-03 16:50:20 And by the time that damn tunnel is built, demand for oil will be so low that enbridge wont be able to make the same profit. Hello. Electric cars!! ICE is not in the cycle plan (Internal Combustion Engines)
4579 2018-12-03 16:50:10 Nobody had problem with climate science 3 decades ago but when the oil lobby found out how much carbon legislation would hit their profits. Hey presto, a whole branch of science suddenly demonized.  And now we got the acolytes endlessly regurgitating denier myths they were fed.
4580 2018-12-03 16:50:04 Respect to a mass murderer, who killed thousands of irakian civilians for oil. Just an another imperialistic beast who is burning in hell. 
Beyond the nation border, all nations despise him and most of americas leaders for their genocides. We'll never forgive and never forget !!!
4581 2018-12-03 16:49:54 @Bungie pleease can you make an Ace of Spades shader? the white with the black and that small hint of rainbow kind of like oil in there, i would literally never use anything else
4582 2018-12-03 16:49:52 IN OLIVE OIL
4583 2018-12-03 16:49:39 Right.  Because the war in the Middle East wasn’t snake oil.    It didn’t make the salesman millions of dollars at all I’m sure.    Yeah right.

Fri’s 3% fall in WTI to sub-$50 comes  as Russian Energy Minister signals his country's oil output will likely hold steady until end of the year. Markets though go into OPEC meeting
4598 2018-12-03 16:48:28 just took a hit of my dab pen and hot oil shot through and burnt my tongue so that’s how my day is going
4599 2018-12-03 16:48:23 What development did PDP give Nigerians for 16 years with massive oil boom at 75% , they gathered and Stole our common wealth, when there is no money again they are cross carpeting. PDP is and was a monumental FAILURE.
4600 2018-12-03 16:48:17 If men got pregnant, you could get an abortion while having the oil changed in your truck.
4601 2018-12-03 16:48:12 Ottawa looking for more reasons why Alberta oil cannot be shipped!
4602 2018-12-03 16:48:07 Ordered a small essential oil for sleep and felt really guilty about my ups guy having to bring this tiny 10ml bottle during crazy season 
4603 2018-12-03 16:47:57 I'm either cooking with olive oil or butter there is no in between
4604 2018-12-03 16:47:53 Saudi has a choice this week; higher oil prices or tougher Iran sanctions. I doubt they can have both. Maybe a token cut of 750k or so, which neither achieves one nor the other. #oott
4605 2018-12-03 16:47:53 Omg จริง 555555555555
4606 2018-12-03 16:47:33 Sir, what do you think about Saudi Arabia and Russia agreeing to cut oil production and raise prices? You were calling for SA to lower prices even more just before G20.
4607 2018-12-03 16:47:27 i just finessed a free oil change :-) #adultthings
4608 2018-12-03 16:47:26 is this really such a harmful statement? I really don't see how this is a deal breaker, but support for Israel, Saudi Arabia, murderous police, or oil companies is not worth mentioning. I followed your account I was hoping to get an alternate view, but all talk about is Bernie
4609 2018-12-03 16:47:26 Instead of being honored most of the Bush family should be prosecuted for war crimes but media is more interested in Stormy Daniels and prosecuting Trump, they had no problem with war and killing and $4.00 oil. #TexasMafia
4610 2018-12-03 16:47:21 @LagosTalks913

4614 2018-12-03 16:46:23 So does that mean the campaign against Alberta oil discriminate against Albertans? #proudAlbertan #buildthepipeline #doublestandard
4615 2018-12-03 16:46:17 Today's performance:-

Crude oil buy SL   (-19000)
Copper buy profit (+12500)
Gold buy profit.     (+90000)
Silver buy profit     (+70000)

Today's total profit = Rs. 153000 
(for 5 lots each)
4616 2018-12-03 16:46:16 Bone saw needs to buy new saws!!! After years of the world most hoarded wealth the oil Sheiks have let their country’s crumble and left their people in ruins. These countries will fall into genocide once the oil is gone. Really pathetic management by these spoiled nepotism kids.
4617 2018-12-03 16:46:13 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
4618 2018-12-03 16:46:09 Qatar announced to quit OPEC from 1st Jan, 2019 to increase its LNG production which is 30% of global production. Qatar was contributing just 2% of total oil production of OPEC. OPEC & Russia produces 40% of global oil.
4619 2018-12-03 16:46:04 "They signify literally nothing. " Do you just not know what "signify" means and are so stupid the idea you might be ignorant never enters into your mind? CO2 decline was do to recession, and we are still the largest CO2 emitter per capita, and cheap oil mean more SUV purchases.
4620 2018-12-03 16:46:03 So a man who falsely imprisons innocent civilians and politicians, let's his armed forces beat people in the streets, plunged a country with the world's largest oil reserve, and was once a bus driver has the credentials to be listened to?

4624 2018-12-03 16:45:33 It's 1 tin chickpeas (drained), 2 tbsp lemon juice, 1tsp garlic (puree is fine), 1tsp cumin, 1 tsp paprika, 1tbsp tahini, 2 tbsps olive oil, and salt to taste. Whack it all in a blender adding just enough water to make it creamy (or more if you prefer it thinner). That's it :D

4626 2018-12-03 16:45:24 It’s sight enhancing oil that’s been injected into the body parts. Very unhealthy, very fake looking.
4627 2018-12-03 16:45:16 My take is a little more brutal. Trudeau with assistance from Notley deliberately and maliciously is destroying the oil industry and with it the Alberta economy. Notley is now looking at re-election thus the play acting

4632 2018-12-03 16:44:54 I dont think world can isolate KSA. They can increase in oil prices anytime by enforcing a cut on supply..see whats happening in #France
4633 2018-12-03 16:44:53 I tried CBD oil for my fibromyalgia and arthritis that I developed as autoimmune problems from vaccines  I took in the past before I became aware. It didn’t help my pain. I may not have taken a high enough dose. It was 3 mg per dropped full. What should be the proper dose?
4634 2018-12-03 16:44:49 งื้อ ของมันต้องมีอยากได้
4635 2018-12-03 16:44:34 It's so sad. I checked your timeline and found out that you are (just like me and others) one of those that castigated GEJ ministers when oil contracts were given to their associates. We all screamed corruption but it's fine when Present VP approved non registered companies

4637 2018-12-03 16:44:12 The right wing tend to be climate change deniers as they are in the pocket of fossil fuel (oil, gas, fracking) profiteers.
4638 2018-12-03 16:44:10 it's completely disingenuous. you should also see their schtick about how 'silly' it is everyone going on about boycotting palm oil completely, when we should rather focus on improving sustainable sources. 

it's gross.
4639 2018-12-03 16:44:07 So, this support for North Sea Oil and Gas thing... that'd be helping us out by finding a use for all the revenue by bailing out the UK economy since the 1970s then, would it? Thanks. We really didn't need do be doing a Norway or we'd have got uppity ideas, eh?
4640 2018-12-03 16:44:04 If you make and/or sell a lip balm, refrain from using coconut oil as your base. Its drying and defeats the purpose of the balm. You're welcome.
4641 2018-12-03 16:43:56 No outfit wouybe complete without having to wipe oil off your shiny face before a selfie
4642 2018-12-03 16:43:56 @MargMcCuaigBoyd sell AB oil to Albertans at $2/barrel more than what we sell on the mkt-albertans can sell it back to gov’t at later date for profits,WIN-WIN Albertans can’t lose
4643 2018-12-03 16:43:53 ah, see that might be the problem.  Yankee Candle always a staple in my house.  You may want to buy soy based candles, which you can use as massage oil as well.
4644 2018-12-03 16:43:42 double lush face scrub, lip scrub, moroccan oil in my hair. good morning
4645 2018-12-03 16:43:40 Hahahaha...at least one should be able to apply greease and little engine oil for easy lubrication lolz...
4646 2018-12-03 16:43:34 Shege shamo ashe u get sense 
4647 2018-12-03 16:43:28 You're a snake oil salesman and right now I'm wanking to the mental image of you being badly burned in a chemical fire.
4648 2018-12-03 16:43:28 Maybe now more Canadians will see how Alberta oil benefits all Canadians.
4649 2018-12-03 16:43:23 After you gave us the idea last week I went out to look for a leverage ETF for Oil...This one came out but I have to be very careful with the tight stop because it goes up and down quick
4650 2018-12-03 16:43:14 Surely you're worldy and tasteful enough to realize the error of this. Spanish tuna packed in olive oil is incredible.
4651 2018-12-03 16:43:06 I lotion my face, oil my beard and my hair, yet my hands are still dry. This is a special kind of ash.
4652 2018-12-03 16:42:46 Beard oil is a need
4653 2018-12-03 16:42:45 HEY DAD - IM GETTING AN OIL CHANGE ON TIME
4654 2018-12-03 16:42:44 Is it me chete or right now in Zim basic commodities like cooking oil, fuel etc are actually more expensive/ harder to get than stonyeni Life ngaisadaro tho!
4655 2018-12-03 16:42:40 lol, oil is 5%, small change.
4656 2018-12-03 16:42:36 .I’m open to being convinced. Just name a couple Obama policies that laid back and waited 8 years before going into effect and then only after he left office and every thing he put into place (that was holding the economy and oil production down) was ripped out by by Trump.
4657 2018-12-03 16:42:30 @180snacks was wondering if the palm oil you use is ethically sourced.
4658 2018-12-03 16:42:29 2/20 2/21 in NYC dinner for 300 and the next day party at the NASDAQ and this time I am saving you a seat. Hey did you get the oil we shipped your team at the Hong Kong  office?
4659 2018-12-03 16:42:20 Beaty-tip-debunk: Castor Oil does not actually help lash and brow growth, unfortunately. But if you're looking for an effective serum Peter Thomas Roth, Lash Food, and RapidLash all have some good ones (in order of effectiveness and positive reviews)
4660 2018-12-03 16:42:11 George HW reminds us of a simpler time, when the simple son of a US Senator beat the odds to attend Yale University, then — somehow! — graduated into a lucrative career in the oil business only to persevere and rise thru the political ranks to become President.
4661 2018-12-03 16:42:09 Involved in ship repair as well, on the back of that business moved into North Sea oil industry. Several lucrative contracts using ship repair staff, bought over several oil related companys in financial difficulties etc.would be interesting to see how he managed his empire
4662 2018-12-03 16:41:53 And the USD hasn't been manipulated via geopolitical conflicts either? OPEC is bound to the USD under the threat of surgical military intervention to 'liberate' certain oil producers.
Regarding China exports, if lacks quality stop buying, tariffs would be redundant 
4663 2018-12-03 16:41:49 That baby oil tells me this all started with a massage. Y’all niggas ain’t slick. 
4664 2018-12-03 16:41:40 Stop buying Palm oil products !

4666 2018-12-03 16:41:36 Ok update...
Still no heat oil company won't come take the oil n give me good oil and the neighbors are bringing me food.  They are also splitting my stumps so at least I have fire.
4667 2018-12-03 16:41:33 HW Bush was not a blue collared Texas good ol boy. He was an evangelical oil tycoon who hated LBGTs. Lets not forget that. #Bush41
4668 2018-12-03 16:41:27 Funny, since oil prices are in a free fall.
4669 2018-12-03 16:41:24 Someone hook it up with an oil change ain’t tryna be at the dealer all day tomorrow on my day off lol

4672 2018-12-03 16:41:16 In any event: Today the message of a jar of oil, that can never be defiled or touched and remains always pure, is a powerful lesson of the special connection every Jew has to his or her heritage. 

Definitely wishing you a happy Chanukah with lots of life and joy!
4673 2018-12-03 16:41:09 Y’all I really do love Take 5. They treat you better than any car dealership when getting an oil change.
4674 2018-12-03 16:41:03 Not detoxing  is like never changing the oil out of your car 
4675 2018-12-03 16:40:39 Many of the oil sands camps are not dry (at least they were not 5 years ago). Even the dry camps are rarely dry in reality.
4676 2018-12-03 16:40:39 Yr pic reminds me to check peanut butter shelves at stores,post-trans-fat ban.Aside from"peanuts only" brands,p. butter was always 1 of the WORST trans-fat foods, full of hydrogenated oil preventing peanut oil from separating. Food cos. wd rather KILL users than make users STIR!
4677 2018-12-03 16:40:39 何か似合いそう
4678 2018-12-03 16:40:38 ...and the side of climate deniers don’t have money on the line in this debate? Are you kidding me? You think oil companies want us talking about climate change? Come on. Grant money doesn’t=mass conspiracy by scientists 
4679 2018-12-03 16:40:24 ＢＢひでえよ…(泣
4680 2018-12-03 16:40:18 @enterprisecares Hi there myself and partner have a rental from your Munich airport branch, while we are traveling today the check engine oil light has come on?? What is the protocol for this problem please?
4681 2018-12-03 16:40:17 France sure does have issues today! Oil Never Sleeps even in France! Enjoy your day Sherry and Ladies!
4682 2018-12-03 16:40:16 I respect this woman’s position, but the mental health and addiction issues among oil field workers cannot be ignored. I wish this conversation would turn toward oil companies who refuse to provide support their workers and allow a toxic environment like this to continue
4683 2018-12-03 16:40:16 Goes for oil change....ends up with a $650 bill. Grrrrr Mondays
4684 2018-12-03 16:40:08 I’m curious to know if you’re aware the oil companies are investing in renewables?
4685 2018-12-03 16:40:05 人に会うたびに膨らんだって言われるけど、明日氷河期が来たら生き残るのは僕だよ。
4686 2018-12-03 16:40:02 Now there's the palm oil fight to have with @kellogsuk
4687 2018-12-03 16:39:57 Actually it has nothing to with controlling prices. We import crude oil only and use to refine it. Prices depends on the import and refining cost. After fulfilling our demand refineries use to export refine Petrol and Diesel to other countries. Got it!
4688 2018-12-03 16:39:54 @jkenney sell AB oil to Albertans at $2/barrel more than what we sell on the mkt-albertans can sell it back to gov’t at later date for profits,WIN-WIN Albertans can’t lose

4702 2018-12-03 16:38:33 $sn lotto a bit with it see it drop the most and now with oil looking better hope for $1.50+. Got only 40k shares
4703 2018-12-03 16:38:25 I don’t believe this is just an American issue global environment issues affect us all - is there a global organisation who can work with you like Avaaz or SumofUs to cover the rest of the world - we don’t need  for us president or oil we need sustainables
4704 2018-12-03 16:38:23 Indeed, but we would be naive to assume that ballistic missiles have nothing to do with unfulfilled nuclear aspirations. Or that another state might provide Iran with nuclear material in return for oil, natural gas, metals, and other resources.
4705 2018-12-03 16:38:22 Have you heard about the benefits of CBD oil? Are you curious to give it a try?

4714 2018-12-03 16:37:10 Man you’ve drunk deep from the Koolaid. The fact of the matter is that industry does what it does based on what a barrel of oil costs. No UN conspiracy needed.
4715 2018-12-03 16:37:09 1.43 in March 14. Oil prices swing wildly which is why wailing about a carbon tax is ridiculous.

4717 2018-12-03 16:36:54 this is embrassing, Beto took 400k from oil and gas and Harris locked up kids all the time as an AG. We can do better then them
4718 2018-12-03 16:36:37 Perhaps our IITs made only for other Countries !!Why Govt. Don't make guidelines to engage them for at least 5yrs. We are paying Tax - IIT students became skilled HR: after that left this country??Paying trillions for #Crude oil but can't spend Crores for research: confused Govt.

4720 2018-12-03 16:36:30 Maybe she is going to tell them about the Claire Ridge oil fields she is going to leave unexplored. It is a conference on climate change and we wouldn't want a fossil fuel based economy.
4721 2018-12-03 16:36:21 Oil prices are more important than life.
4722 2018-12-03 16:36:13 Things I need to do today: get my oil changed.  Things I don’t want to do today: get my oil changed.

4726 2018-12-03 16:35:58 .Whose benefits would have her cut?

Whose taxes would you have her increase?

Which people should she fire and put out of work?

At some oil selling for $10 a barrel, I'd say that they're paying down the deficit in accordance to earnings.

4732 2018-12-03 16:35:29 No actually... I’ve been thinking too hard about this. but how would you even do that? Peanuts are really fatty, which makes them perfect for turning into a butter...but how would you get packing peanuts to produce any amount of oil?? how would they not dissolve???
4733 2018-12-03 16:35:16 It is a common expression that means if you are persistent, you will be taken care of.

I believe it comes from the industrial age when gears would rotate to make a machine work.  The squeaky gear would get oil (grease) to stop the noise and ensure continued successful operation
4734 2018-12-03 16:35:15 I was doing that for some time as well (although I've been bad lately and just bit them off again and I'm about to get acrylics on for a special occasion) when I was working on growing them I used jojoba oil almost daily it's great for your nails and skin.
4735 2018-12-03 16:35:15 Hahaha isn't that the truth plus, I reckon some oil money could have exchanged hands ;D ;D ;D
4736 2018-12-03 16:35:14 #California's forests should be carbon sinks, not carbon emitters. However, keep in mind that forest fires are terrestrial, part of the existing carbon budget. To prevent worse climate change, we need to stop the introduction of new CO2 wrested from underground by oil wells.
4737 2018-12-03 16:35:13 -buy the good toilet paper

4747 2018-12-03 16:34:22 Ben, shah of Iran was labeled a puppet by Zionist mafia due to his defiance of Israel. Shah & mossadegh both wanted nationalization of oil. Zionists infiltrated Iran intelligence services & radicalized many as revolutionary Islamists to dethrone shah exactly because he opposed em

4771 2018-12-03 16:31:36 A country of about 3-4 million? And making more money from oil than Nigeria. What do you expect?
4772 2018-12-03 16:31:33 @MikeKellyPA @SenToomey @SenBobCasey: Tell @realDonaldTrump @SecretaryZinke not to risk >1.5 million jobs and ~$108 billion in GDP in the Atlantic for <7 months’ worth of oil and <6 months’ worth of gas. #BlockTheBlast #ProtectOurCoast
4773 2018-12-03 16:31:32 It is God who keeps a man alive, and those who wish death on their fellow man are carrying a bottle of oil with a leaking cap, while dressed in white.
4774 2018-12-03 16:31:29 Domestic oil exploration should be continued until we no longer import oil from the Venezuelas and Saudi Arabias of the world. It is unethical to condone fossil fuel extraction abroad when we have the most stringent humanitarian and environmental protections laws on Earth.

What I'm actually angry about is the idiotic, drunken-sailor squandering habits of this prime minister. There is something for you to troll about.
4809 2018-12-03 16:28:23 Look how they're selling off oil today...wow
4810 2018-12-03 16:28:22 Of course, the news most affecting the Stock and MBS Markets is the news on the Trade Truce between US and China.  Also, news that OPEC and Russia will cut back on Oil Production is getting some attention too.

4832 2018-12-03 16:26:37 Looked it up. WCS is made with bitumen and is therefore a heavy oil that is costly to refine. Yeah, pipelines will not save Alberta oil industry. There are increasingly too many cheaper and cleaner alternatives. Money that would be spent on pipelines should be used to diversify.
4833 2018-12-03 16:26:34 1) In its rush to sell oil and gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the Trump administration isn’t just threatening to destroy one of our last pristine and untouched wild places. It is undermining fundamental elements of the National Environmental Policy Act.

4868 2018-12-03 16:22:18 You're from Ontario, maybe your first action should be to stop fueling your car with that Saudi oil; as Alberta sure can't get the oil to your province without pipelines!
4869 2018-12-03 16:22:11 I don't think you are getting this. I've worked in oil and gas camps and on days-off you either drive 10+hrs back home or fly out that morning. There is no hanging around in towns. Can't comment on other types of camps (logging, mining, etc.).

4878 2018-12-03 16:21:33 Ya you're right, but
"It's the bitumen, mister"
doesn't have any sense of urgency. People are hurting and placing blame. I can't shake off that corporate greed and manipulation of the markets are the biggest factors.
And definitions.
Bitumen is not Oil as far as I'm concerned.

4890 2018-12-03 16:20:29 oui oui.
4891 2018-12-03 16:20:21 I have a different take than that, it really has to do with oil prices, inflation expectations and future rate hike outlook. With oil going below $59 call like I thought it would, I assumed we would be under 0.7% bps today, 18.5 is high at this time of the year
4892 2018-12-03 16:20:18 There are about 4 Million Indian citizens in Saudi Arabia. Leave oil, leave everything else but this one thing cannot be overlooked.
4893 2018-12-03 16:20:12 Three large producers make more money upgrading their own heavy oil and making large profits on this.   This results in much less royalties and tax revenue for Alberta.
4894 2018-12-03 16:20:12 So I guess that would be considered state-owned oil.

4899 2018-12-03 16:19:28 After the CRUSHING comes THE OIL
4900 2018-12-03 16:19:10 I'm sure you can oil it.
4901 2018-12-03 16:19:05 Thank you Chairman Jim Gooch and @Bruce_Scott for recognizing the efforts and successes of KY’s Oil and Gas Workgroup.
4902 2018-12-03 16:19:04 Not much change in the gas prices.We are still sitting at the same prices but the oil price has gone up a few cents. #petroleum

4904 2018-12-03 16:18:56 I certainly agree that he would totally be disgusted with Caesar Trump - President Roosevelt's administration filed 44 antitrust lawsuits during his terms in office and succeeded in breaking up Standard Oil which was America's biggest "trust" corporation!
4905 2018-12-03 16:18:46 Great condition, clean, smoke free. Brand new tires, oil always changed at 3000, clean title.
4906 2018-12-03 16:18:45 There are no pipelines between the prairies and the east coast so we have no choice but to import oil from some pretty brutal regimes. 

The pipelines between the prairies and the west coast are at max capacity but more is needed. 

Rail is a far more dangerous option than pipeli
4907 2018-12-03 16:18:30 Hey @RyanSitton Jeremy Baker with KENS5 here. We Skyped when people were panicking about that "gas shortage." Would you be available to Skype about gas prices and the oil industry? You can reach me at 210-336-6527.

4910 2018-12-03 16:18:18 A research carried out by Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC), 
 shows that if we increase the volume of raw material exports we can still make money and create jobs. Crude Oil export is distracting us...
4911 2018-12-03 16:18:07 8%.....do you think it’s right and fair that Scotland receives 8% of NS oil revenue when its Scotland’s oil. If we received the 92% on top we’d be fine n dandy. Yes/No?

4916 2018-12-03 16:17:40 I don’t get it. Their goal is to raise oil prices.

4918 2018-12-03 16:17:25 Nothing can negate the fact gender violence is an issue everywhere. The PM has targeted oil camp because it fits his political agenda.

ie. I think we could all agree places like Universities are not gender diverse as we would all like them to be and that's well documented.
4919 2018-12-03 16:17:15 You nailed it!!!! 40 years of doing eff all but line their own pockets & those of the oil industry without ONCE considering the ppl of AB. 40 years of planning & investing in AB was NEVER in the cards. Can u imagine what a difference that would mean today? It’s sickening as hell!
4920 2018-12-03 16:17:07 I hear this a lot but me the tail be the best na eti no wo oil dodo.

4926 2018-12-03 16:16:32 On a conference call this AM, and the speaker used a jarring metaphor, that recent oil trade policies "neutered" sanctions, as a means to say that their power and efficacy had been diminished. (1/2)
4927 2018-12-03 16:16:21 Yemen has serface oil. America sold uranium tipped weapons to Saudi Arabia there is no excuse whatsoever to drop those anywhere near children. The only place they should be dropped is on the Trump family. And other presidents families that have use these weapons like Obama family
4928 2018-12-03 16:16:12 They frittered away the Fund and never developed refining capacity or a move away from oil. They failed Albertans.
4929 2018-12-03 16:16:07 Do they not have that problem in France too? Corporations seem to have too much power the world over. Perhaps they are not as dependent on oil and gas corporations in particular though.
4930 2018-12-03 16:16:03 I can only guess.  But..Canadian conservatives mimick their GOP counterparts. There's fake thinks ie Fraser Inst., Cdn Taxpayer Fedn is funded by Atlas Network, Kochs own oil land, spend millions in dark money, religious far right racists help U.S. elections, manpower, data, etc.
4931 2018-12-03 16:15:58 I hate coming to get an oil change... takes entirely too long

4934 2018-12-03 16:15:44 No! It means the price of a barrel of oil is way way down.  This directly affects my families lives in West Texas and ultimately, economically, all of us. #notagoodthing

4951 2018-12-03 16:14:21 I thought i just read oil is going up due to production cuts by Saudis, China, and Canada.

4988 2018-12-03 16:09:49 I know right, Michael Corleone at least pretended to be an olive oil importer
4989 2018-12-03 16:09:44 Yes, so looking forward now, it is the rate at which money supply grows relative to the growth in the oil supply/demand ratio that will determine if oil goes up or down in price.
4990 2018-12-03 16:09:42 Never. God made em right the first time. But I usually sauté in Olive oil to Carmelize.
4991 2018-12-03 16:09:41 I have no idea what to do with commodities right now. At one point I was considering putting them in as a hedge, but oil so volatile right now it is hard to make sense of sentiment.

Thank you @MamadorNg

5019 2018-12-03 16:06:42 you recently sent out a press release making a big hoo-ha about your pie ranges being first to utilise sustainable sources of palm oil. (you also made this claim in 2015!). based on that, it's not unreasonable to ask: do your mince pies use sustainable palm oil or not?
5020 2018-12-03 16:06:40 Global growth is slowing imho. Oil supply > demand. My point is that if the #Fed and other central banks revert to "stimulus on steroids" and the dollar is losing its oil backing, then it's about the rate of increase in money supply vs oil demand/supply that determines price.

5025 2018-12-03 16:06:06 Trudeau can get this pipeline built if he wanted to under our Constitution. He can declare it of National Importance HE DOESN’T WANT TO. He hates OIL & he hates the WEST more. 
5026 2018-12-03 16:06:03 My truck. I thought the oil change place had messed something up, but now it looks like a pump or compressor with the a/c or heater is going. It gets loud for a bit then gets quiet. 
Combine that with my coolant leak and it gets interesting!  
But it still runs and all is well!
5027 2018-12-03 16:05:58 I like drizzling oil & Lemon pepper on my broccoli an put it in the oven 
5028 2018-12-03 16:05:58 And the FACT that DA does *highlight* the oil and gas industry’s so-called “solution” (*not a solution *) to sequester carbon underground, (hence implying we can keep on fracking?) actually says it ALL.
5029 2018-12-03 16:05:46 Same B.S. she spread in the TV adds which claimed #TMX expansion would not result in more oil just a better price. Only 1 extra tanker a day not 7. Guess she finally realized expansion MEANS more as the ad has been replaced. #ClimateChange @RachelNotley @JustinTrudeau #cdnpoli

5033 2018-12-03 16:05:30 Can you check my dip stick? I think I need an oil change....
5034 2018-12-03 16:05:18 Its lack of egress for the land locked oil. You would assume when the government buys a pipeline they could get it done unlike the private sector who has had 50 years to do it. But no
5035 2018-12-03 16:05:15 LOL because no oil patch worker in his skin tight Tap Out or Affliction tee-shirt has EVER sexually assaulted or harassed an Alberta woman in a drunken/ coked out stupor lol lol lol. Ever been to Fort Mac on a Friday night bro?
5036 2018-12-03 16:05:06 Maybe we should join the french and protest about fuel prices.oil prices have dropped
5037 2018-12-03 16:05:03 When we are spending close to a million building a naval Base for Ukraine and demanding the return of Crimea and are threatening Iran and are still occupying the oil fields of Syria, yes, good time to silence @rt because they might get in the way of our own propaganda.
5038 2018-12-03 16:04:56 It is a very limited movement (3000 persons) and not link to European Union but focus on oil taxes that have been recently increased, it will be finished in a few days

5044 2018-12-03 16:04:33 interesting: theory that the world’s oil supplies will never actually run out due to their immense value when stocks become so low that the remaining oil will be too precious to use. I call this the freaks and geeks effect after me not allowing myself to watch the final episode
5045 2018-12-03 16:04:30 Gawd.  What they need are candidates who raise their own money and are not beholden to corporate America, big oil, or big pharmaceutical.  If not, it will be more of the same, and that is a fact.  It’s as though no one had been paying attention at all.
5046 2018-12-03 16:04:15 Our oil has earned the seal of the COOC confirming that it meets its strict standards-100% California-grown EVOO; meets/exceeds the standards of the Olive Oil Commission of California, which are generally accepted as being stricter than the International Olive Council standards.

5052 2018-12-03 16:03:48 you know what, that’s not even an answer. 

i have read your position/s on palm oil quite extensively before I started putting together a database on #palmoil products. I’m not an idiot, and I find this kind of condescending and vague reply quite franklu insulting.

Death+destruction at tailing ponds, or wind turbines or toxic runoff of China's mines producing minerals for our cell phones+electric cars? We must do better.

5065 2018-12-03 16:02:31 Yes a province that allowed foreign oil companies to extract without restriction, and allowed them to take our oil for pennies.  This is what 44 years of tories making us completely dependent on American oil companies results in.
5066 2018-12-03 16:02:26 Essential oil companies make a lot of pseudoscientific nonsense claims, but they def smell good! I use EO deodorants instead of traditional antiperspirants bcuz my skin is so sensitive to pretty much everything. They seem to work. I like lavender & citrus

5068 2018-12-03 16:02:19 Canada buys about 75-80,000 bbls/day of Saudi oil vs a daily production of about 4,200,000. Not exactly a drop in the bucket, but not the mythical amount some are using to justify uneconomic projects like Energy East.

5076 2018-12-03 16:01:40 What's the implication of Qatar exit from OPEC in terms of global oil output and sales, and in view of the fact that Nigeria rely heavily on (crude) oil revenue. 

Anyone?

5079 2018-12-03 16:01:13 You will find more scientists follow my train of thought than yours.  Hence the IPCC report, the COP24 on now.

5099 2018-12-03 15:59:24 So the dollar tanking to the point where the US started issuing debt in CHF because there was no demand for dollar debt had nothing to do with OPEC ramping up the price of oil in nominal dollar terms or Volckers sending interest rates to historically high levels?

Use a gentle cleanser to remove any makeup, dirt, or oil on the lips. A milk cleanser would be best, nothing to strip or dehydrate the lips further

5140 2018-12-03 15:56:08 Sounds like an argument for the renationalisation of oil......state owned oil exploration has done Norway no harm at all
5141 2018-12-03 15:56:00 You guys used to be able to say - oh they’re just trying to scare us.  It’s a hoax.  The scientists just want funding.  The oil companies spent billions of dollars manufacturing the illusion of a “debate” despite study after study confirming the findings.
5142 2018-12-03 15:55:40 Not only that...you can only buy oil thru opec using the dollar.  You have no dollars...good luck buying oil...

To make the latkes, preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C). When the oven is hot, pour 2 tablespoons of oil onto 2 jelly roll pans and turn them in every direction so that the oil coats the pans. Heat the pans in the oven for 5 minutes.
5147 2018-12-03 15:55:25 Y'all I spent two hours yesterday making latkes ~ sweating in the oil soaked kitchen ~ only for my dog (he's a big one) to jump on the counter last night at 2AM, drag the latkes off, crash the plate on the floor, and eat them all. I love him but he's a little prick!!!
5148 2018-12-03 15:55:21 @andrew_leach @trevortombe what's the Gov't ability to change the Royalty agreement with oil companies? If they were to change the Royalty revenue to a base amount per barrel so Albertans were getting at least a minimum per barrel then why not let the market play out
5149 2018-12-03 15:55:13 The answer to populism is more populism just as the answer to higher oil prices is even higher prices. Wonder why free market lovers dont apply their principles everywhere?

5180 2018-12-03 15:53:00 Thanks for this clarification. So once refined, bitumen does not become WCS oil? And if there is a glut of bitumen due to demand-side problems (closure of refineries, available of product that is turned more cheaply into energy or refined more cheaply) how do pipelines help?
5181 2018-12-03 15:53:00 Interesting. I thought they went after him bc he didn’t want to use the dollar anymore for oil trading, which would cost Bush’s oil profits. Didn’t know he was C-A. Also explains why they killed instead of captured him.

5189 2018-12-03 15:52:21 I feel embarrassed for Mr. Lukas & editors. The essay is wrongheaded.  Judaism dealt w/this issue millennia ago. It is NOT about the war against Hellenists and conquerors, nor a competition with Santa/Solstice.  It is about miracles. The war was played DOWN in favor of the oil.
5190 2018-12-03 15:52:21 Don't think there are any pipelines from Alberta to Eastern Canada so loss of Saudi oil would just mean more U.S. imports to no economic benefit to Alberta. Price at the pump would increase in Atlantic Canada. Sounds like cutting off the nose to spite the face.

5205 2018-12-03 15:51:28 CNN is correct here.  Lower prices means US companies cap wells and jobs are lost.  Of course CNN never reported that under obama when oil dropped.  They just drooled all over his feet even more when prices dropped, which BTW, wasn’t often under his reign.

5215 2018-12-03 15:50:52 That is not the case as we are seeing. First, money supply growth chasing one asset is incorrect, respectfully, second it is a disinflationary force because fiat currency is used to purchase financial assets, including oil futures and long term the underlying falls
5216 2018-12-03 15:50:38 Clean oil is an oxymoron. Pretending we don't have to mobilize NOW is nonsense. You may be fine with a Mad Max world but that's not the future I want for my family.

5218 2018-12-03 15:50:31 No sarcasm intended (at least not with this one). People are ingenious when motivated. Oil was considered a poison to land when discovered until a use was found for it. We need to not use it until we find better ways to use it. Human excrement could probably be used as ...

5245 2018-12-03 15:48:29 Your article misses her point entirely. Any industry that sells products at an international exchange traded price cannot pass on the Ctax   to consumers and bears the entire cost within the industry. The same thing applies to oil, potash, timber, paper, uranium.  Our industries.

5250 2018-12-03 15:48:14 If more fiat currency paper is chasing a hard asset like oil, then it is a question of the rate at which that currency is being created relative to that in existence vs the rate of increase in net oil supply/demand relative to its existing ratio. Much more paper chasing more oil.

5264 2018-12-03 15:47:02 That’s what happens when the “franchise QB” goes down and you plug in a 5yo back up qb HOPING not to screw it all up (but he throws 3in in Dallas) Ohh and BTW w a defense that’s leaking oil. @granthpaulsen @funnydanny On top of that vs a division rival,doesn’t look so promising.
5265 2018-12-03 15:47:01 It's not about the oil. They have finally had enough of new world order.
5266 2018-12-03 15:46:54 We will continue to burn oil and coal, and probably it does us good. The Earth will get greener as a result.”

“CO2 is so beneficial […] it would be crazy to try to reduce it,” Dyson said. “Man-made climate change is, on the whole, good.”   \2

5275 2018-12-03 15:46:13 And sell Sri Lanka. The economic institutions such as airports, ports and oil tanks. Burden people with taxes taxes. Spoke only about debts and not having a short and medium term plan to develop the economy. Took the easiest way out to sell our economic institutions.

They wont say no anyway they will delay for 40 years untill the oil runs out.

5284 2018-12-03 15:45:45 I still turn like an oil tanker. Guess who’s going to go skate public sessions.
5285 2018-12-03 15:45:42 The industry likes to say that the oil will flow anyway, but recent experience has proven that wrong. If we make it harder to transport it from that region, less will be produced. And of course, we should make it harder to produce everywhere, shifting the supply curve.
5286 2018-12-03 15:45:41 Happy Chanukah, @rheawolfson. Your message makes much more sense than the one from @jeremycorbyn telling us we must all help refugees because of the miracle of the oil. Let's spread the light through @UKLabour.
5287 2018-12-03 15:45:41 You centrists have become more defensive of corporate politics than Republicans. And if you are trying to argue such huge donations won't affect his votes on oil and fracking, you're not a journalist to trust

5309 2018-12-03 15:44:20 executions of starving prisoners for scrounging for edibleplants. Abortions being performed by injecting motor oil into the wombs of pregnant women.

The deputy premier for education, was killed in front of a firing squad after showing “disrespectful posture” in a meeting.
5310 2018-12-03 15:44:14 Those factors are real, but they are orthogonal to the arguments about closing off access to tar sands. Stopping pipelines increases the costs and the spread for tar sands oil, which is what recent experience shows.

5314 2018-12-03 15:43:46 Why doesn’t anyone on the Oil do something about it then?
5315 2018-12-03 15:43:45 Oil companies may not be completely responsible for climate change but they sure as hell are making substantial contributions to the cause.

5317 2018-12-03 15:43:34 No US companies took oil. In the 1991 Gulf War, coalition forces repelled Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, then stopped 150 miles from Baghdad & returned to the Iraq-Kuwait border.

They did not conquer Iraq or take oil. We’re talking about Bush Sr, not Bush Jr & the 2nd Iraq War.
5318 2018-12-03 15:43:21 What happens if price of oil in $USD falls amidst the decline in the #petrodollar system while prices across everything else (i.e. wages) rises? Would one say Fed could possibly be misaligned with true inflation dynamics? Asking for a friend...
5319 2018-12-03 15:43:13 Even if what you said was true about socialism, in regards to @yaronbrook, the first video I found has him saying that because we always find more oil tomorrow, we cannot possibly consider it as a resource that will eventually run out. GG. Next, please.
5320 2018-12-03 15:43:10 From September 2016 to September 2018 US oil production increased by 3 million barrels per day or 35%....and people were still calling for $100 oil this year and betting other people’s money on it
5321 2018-12-03 15:43:00 If saying “work force transience can affect communities” is an attack on oil workers, is saying “1 in 10 children in Alberta are abused” an attack on parents and social workers? When do I get to cry about reality? #ABLeg

5324 2018-12-03 15:42:46 Arguably the biggest manipulator of oil prices for at least this year has been the US state department via Iranian sanctions
5325 2018-12-03 15:42:39 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
5326 2018-12-03 15:42:31 The simple answer is $40. It depends on the field and complexity of project. A couple a years ago when oil dipped to there fracking in US was hurting.
5327 2018-12-03 15:42:31 motor oil is required. you also need water in radiator to keep car from overheating. I have one working on experimental and it drives pretty well now.

5333 2018-12-03 15:41:45 Like Obama said. Russia has one thing that’s gas and oil. When oil is selling at $50 a barrel it’s hardly worth pumping it out of the ground. Plus the whole world is going green. I’m surprised Trump was the only hold out on climate change bill at the G 20.?
5334 2018-12-03 15:41:42 And I don't know why it put round rock?? And not Top. We lived in Grandbury for 7 years.  Oh did you find and snake oil there . They have some good snake oil salesman there.teehee.

5346 2018-12-03 15:41:09 Thank you for responding to McFeely, Rob. I found a different source for state oil tax rates but the numbers were identical to what you listed. I didn't know about the charitable giving you listed, but McFeely could have spent 2 mins to look into the tax rates...like I did.
5347 2018-12-03 15:40:54 Paris is burning. Alberta oil production is being curtailed. Carbon tax is implemented and proposed to increase. The globalist agenda is impacting our ability to sustain. Something has to change.
5348 2018-12-03 15:40:54 Dawn dish soap is good if you need to clean dishes, or I guess if you need to clean oil off of a duck for some reason.

5355 2018-12-03 15:40:08 I'm a fan - the only issue for some would be their use of peanut oil with their fries.  Also, don't worry about ever ordering a large fry - they tend to dump an entire scoop in the bag on top of what you order, so a small goes a long way.
5356 2018-12-03 15:39:56 Not asking for perfection. Just asking for someone who's not a racist, corrupt, p.o.s. ready to blow up brown people the world over to protect oil profits.
5357 2018-12-03 15:39:56 Listening the news the first four items are all related to climate change and oil production 1) Alberta’s oil curtail plan2) Qatar quits #OPEC 3) demonstrators in France against carbon tax 4) climate change conference in #Poland

5359 2018-12-03 15:39:48 Certainly not considering the tax revenues they collect is way up at 37.5% of our GDP for non-oil domestic products. 

We need independence to make sure Oil is also taxed correctly...U.K. figures don’t add up. Clair Ridge has been up and running collecting a min £14m per day
5360 2018-12-03 15:39:47 @RachelNotley Yah I understand the economics of the oil industry, however your not listening to me Rachel. Diversify the portfolio and remember that CP RAILWAY is the backbone of our Canadian economy so ask for money to rebuil d the trains. Der Jude

5363 2018-12-03 15:39:33 Hang on now, let's not get too crazy here ben. I think a LOT of people want Gaben to engage in oil wrestling with Chinese officials.

5365 2018-12-03 15:39:15 keep your candles burning and those lamps filled with oil. times are perilous as it is and they will only get more volatile as we approuch Jesus second coming pray without ceasiing and fight like a soldier of God!! see you in the clouds soon my friends!!
5366 2018-12-03 15:39:07 They use fish oil in everything so technically it's not vegetarian. You should mention monk food next time around. I voted for AAP don't troll me
5367 2018-12-03 15:39:05 Did a bike ride a few weeks ago past an oil refinery and was thinking to myself at the time, “I bet Paul Sherwen could make even this sound interesting”.
5368 2018-12-03 15:39:04 the lady at the dispensary said this oil was good for pain and it is. because it makes you go the fuck to sleep instantly
5369 2018-12-03 15:38:55 Is Canada doing anything to help support and retrain workers in oil and coal industries? Here in the states the official policy is to promise that they'll all get their jobs back. That promise isn't being kept, of course.

5373 2018-12-03 15:38:40 Rather than protesting pipelines, or valves, or wrenches, I'll be curtailing my use of oil
5374 2018-12-03 15:38:29 Kinda like the old tv show Beverly Hillbillies where Clampits from Arkansas strike oil and move to Hollywood but w/o any social skills and keep the chickens and goats in the house.
5375 2018-12-03 15:38:27 TARGET PRICE - The annual operating budget of Saudi Arabia, heavily dependent on the price of oil, required a breakeven crude oil price of $83 a barrel in 2017 and $85-$87 a barrel in 2018 (source: IMF).
5376 2018-12-03 15:38:22 For soup, cook sliced onion in oil, then simmer with meatballs, cayenne, mushroom broth and mushrooms. Top with basil.
5377 2018-12-03 15:38:18 I agree with all your points, but I think this last one is perhaps a bit too far from what people want:

Nobody expects Gaben to challenge Tang Liangzhi to an oil wrestling match in downtown Chongqing for Kuku to play, but Valve could definitely take lots of intermediate steps.
5378 2018-12-03 15:38:04 These ppl taking forever for an oil change
5379 2018-12-03 15:38:01 Pilot: Folks we lost some oil pressure in engine one and it is out now.
Passenger: How far can one engine get us?
Me: All the way to the crash site. Which is where we're headed anyway. Think we'll beat the paramedics to it by like half an hour too.
5380 2018-12-03 15:37:44 Why cant we have governments who do what's right concerning climate change? #ClimateChange #pipelines canada is owned by the oil industry
5381 2018-12-03 15:37:39 So many! I started doing it for sensitivity but it also whitens your teeth & can reverse/prevent cavities. Coconut oil is a natural antibacterial & antiinflammatory so it cleanses & helps with gingivitis. It also detoxifies your body & can aid in weight loss. The list goes on.
5382 2018-12-03 15:37:37 Paint the tray with black oil paint.... New Again....
5383 2018-12-03 15:37:37 It's not the amount it's the way he tweeted like a 15 year old to his favourite TV show.

It's fucking cringy and gives the opposition more ammo that Trudeau is vain and only wants to be popular.

The amount is fine! Just dont tweet it casually as AB slows oil production. Optics!
5384 2018-12-03 15:37:37 I see no reason why the Oil and Gas Industry and the Electricity sector should stand in silos. Convergence is here!
5385 2018-12-03 15:37:36 Oil changed. Tires rotated. Fluid topped off. New serpentine belt. Now just need my rear brakes and a parking sensor an we back 100

5387 2018-12-03 15:37:26 And to suggest frauds like #gwynethpaltrow were a result of the world becoming more secular and educated is preposterous. Snake oil salesmen have existed for hundreds of years.

5395 2018-12-03 15:36:27 What are the odds that @realDonaldTrump will be happy for prices for #WTI to rise now that he has signed a deal with #China for some sweet US crude? Sounds illogical but...is it past him to tweet that he’s created US jobs because of it?! #OOTT #Oil #G20

5397 2018-12-03 15:36:25 The true reason for Americas Middle East issues CIA Bush chasing his oil. What the MSM refuses to tell you. Lets not forget those Marines held in Iran because of illegal involvement
5398 2018-12-03 15:36:24 The sad part is it was unnecessary and completely avoidable by putting a pipeline through and negotiating a fair price for Alberta crude oil.
Alas, WE allowed our leaders to corner Alberta into the situation we have now.  We’re now on the back foot and desperate times are ahead.
5399 2018-12-03 15:36:21 Thanks for informing me!! For many reasons I wasn't able to follow the situation. I'm from New Orleans originally though and payed as close attention as I could to the BP spill, but I'd momentarily forgotten about it. Geo politics = oil.
5400 2018-12-03 15:36:20 Todos aplauden la baja del precio de la nafta. Nadie dice nada del aumento del Gas oil que es el motor de la producción en este país. Xq los corrimos a los ingleses. País sin materia pensante.....
5401 2018-12-03 15:36:06 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
5402 2018-12-03 15:36:05 Even the oil we have, we don't even know how to refine. We are still importing refined fuel into Nigeria.
5403 2018-12-03 15:36:03 well if we can make a battery from carbon and salt. You might figure out how to clean the oceans; river run off, algae blooms, oil and micro plastic problems. thatd be great for aquatic life.

5405 2018-12-03 15:35:44 norway isnt there .But can u imagine if usa done with oil what Norway have done with it  a win win for american population.
5406 2018-12-03 15:35:28 Surprise,  Obama lies! His administration actions were anti-business and for big government. They shut down offshore drilling,  removed land for oil exploration and would not approve oil pipelines.  Trump is pro- business and puts America First!

5413 2018-12-03 15:34:49 You know what Lorraine? If you don’t understand the impact of oil on the Canadian economy and you believe it’s only an Alberta problem then you’re too stupid for Twitter (and that’s saying a lot) Come back when you’ve done your homework.
5414 2018-12-03 15:34:45 At my work we gotta watch out for those oil spills. I seen enough cartoons to know better.
5415 2018-12-03 15:34:38 Hahaha ji wo bhi kam oil me
5416 2018-12-03 15:34:33 Many countries are cutting road widths and closing flyovers to fight pollution and traffic nuisance. We are heavily dependent on oil imports and still invest in fancy & useless projects like elevated corridors instead of discouraging pvt transprt and putting money in pub transprt

5418 2018-12-03 15:34:28 As slippery as an oil spill, trust him 
5419 2018-12-03 15:34:27 It's another December, and oil workers have started threatening again. 

What a sh*thole
5420 2018-12-03 15:34:24 It was the opposition to nuclear energy that made Europe dependable to Russian gas. Otherwise middle East could've replaced Russian oil as oil is much cheaper to transport on tankers than LNG and renewable is no replacement for combustion engine
5421 2018-12-03 15:34:24 Is this true, @CNN? Are you really laying blame at #Trump's feet as oil prices continue to drop? That truly is petty and pathetic.
5422 2018-12-03 15:34:15 I love this car shop, every time I come get an oil change they fix everything on my car

5425 2018-12-03 15:33:59 There is a proper way of making spending decisions. Tweeting such a commitment at a celebrity in this fashion is not an appropriate way of doing business. Typical of Trudeau to pander to celebrities while Albertans are suffering & the Saudis laugh at our dependence on their oil.
5426 2018-12-03 15:33:57 Tradition dictates I consume latkes twice a year. In the day when my family was extended my mother’s kitchen had all burners going frying latkes. She’d make 100s! Now it’s only me and my sis and I will enjoy a few but not like we used to! But still, hot out of the oil 
5427 2018-12-03 15:33:55 WTI oil at $53.09/barrel, +$2.15.
5428 2018-12-03 15:33:53 So let's raise interest rates to ensure it keeps going down 
higher oil prices make that possible. Oh wait...

5434 2018-12-03 15:32:57 I think drilling for oil in #ANWR is a great idea because it will expedite the destruction of the earth and the extinction of human beings. Not quite as quick and painless as a nuclear war but the next best thing. Thanks @realDonaldTrump! Keep it up you’re doing great!
5435 2018-12-03 15:32:50 I read somewhere that lower oil is like lower corporate taxes, initial sugar high that runs out.

5442 2018-12-03 15:32:26 Hey @JustinTrudeau how about you invest Canadian taxpayers money in #Canada for Canadian issues, like all the oil problems in #Alberta.  I know it's a crazy thought, but giving away $50 million on Twitter to a celebrity who asks is far crazier.
5443 2018-12-03 15:32:24 the oil market is the most manipulated market on the planet. never ceases to amaze me how the manufacture rallies out of the blue when the price gets too low.

5447 2018-12-03 15:32:08 Yep, kid wasn’t going to do this with the Oilers. Ppl forget it’s not cut and dry. He didn’t mesh with the oilers and he had a bad attitude (it is relevant) and he never ever proved he deserved to play higher with the oil. Waiver pick up must have smartened him up.

5452 2018-12-03 15:31:31 As I say, it was before my birth — as I learned it, Iraq had occupied Kuwait, which was then invaded so as to be, well, not occupied anymore. That oil was involved is, of course, a complicating factor. Care to expand?

5460 2018-12-03 15:30:56 He let through enough of an uptick of fossil fuel pipelines across the country that made offshore drilling in sensitive ecosystems go from "out of line off charts too expensive" into "monetarily profitable"- especially the way the BP oil spill was handled-so yes-he paved the way

5467 2018-12-03 15:30:33 I thought canned tuna was gross, too, until I tried tuna that had been packed in olive oil. That was an utter game-changer. Our U.S. obsession with cutting a few fat calories here or there means we pack it in water and then add mayo to mask the flavor.

5478 2018-12-03 15:29:41 They really couldn’t stand each other. Didn’t subscribe to the same philosophy. You can like them both individually but together they were oil and water. That’s part of the reason Pittman left.
5479 2018-12-03 15:29:30 Oil is in a "disinflationary trend". Oil is cheaper now than over 10 years ago (and there has been some descent inflation in this period). I am just saying that with Brent at 61 and WTI at 52 there is not going to be much effort to find new oil while depletion runs at 4.5 pct yr.
5480 2018-12-03 15:29:26 Your not part of OPEC ,so stay out of international interest . Alberta will never run out of oil money, NDPS are getting greedy,and trying to look good for the up and coming election in Alberta. All provinces under Trudeau LIBERALS are hurting, NOT just Albertians.

5483 2018-12-03 15:29:20 The situation in Alberta isn't Trudeau's fault. The massive companies currently extracting oil have always planned to saddle taxpayers with the cleanup bill. The economic repercussions of that are going to destroy the country.

5490 2018-12-03 15:28:33 Hi, since 2015, we have sourced 100% of our palm oil for our own-label food products from sustainable RSPO-certified sources. We are on track to ensure that 100% of palm oil for our own brand non-food products is sourced from RSPO certified sources by the end of 2018.
5491 2018-12-03 15:28:32 Actually I misquoted the oil production. Its actually 2.8 million barrels a day. So more than doubled in terms of upgraders.

5493 2018-12-03 15:28:24 all they sell is oil no bud?
5494 2018-12-03 15:28:13 No, I want to impose a tax on oil because it's dogshit for the environment. This doesn't make the cars any worse, just a bit more expensive compared to EV's. Which will drive investment into EV's and make them even better.
5495 2018-12-03 15:28:08 Both oils are very beneficial for health , but i prefer avocado oil because it has more buttery taste also perfect choice for baking.
5496 2018-12-03 15:28:07 @ryanjespersen why don’t we refine our own oil?  R the environmental regulations worse than pipelines?
5497 2018-12-03 15:28:03 Well, that’s a brave & bold idea, but who’s going to risk being assassinated by the big oil company to achieve this? 


5498 2018-12-03 15:27:49 I’m not NDP but this is the right decision.   She called for a 9% drop in production and oil goes up 10%. So, pretty even I’d say. Not really a concession speech

5502 2018-12-03 15:27:27 Before you mourn Bush 41 too much, Google the Carlyle Group and Halliburton.

5518 2018-12-03 15:25:59 Isn't part of this not acknowledging that the predicament is 80% peak oil related and 20% AGW, not 100% AGW-justified  decarbonization ?
5519 2018-12-03 15:25:59 with less than 3% of crude oil, 97% dirty oil production in alberta it can be a perfect time to stop unnecessary high pollution production
5520 2018-12-03 15:25:53 Yeah I’d just go for the recommended oil, if you try it and get clutch slip you’ll just have to pay the same money for semi-synthetic and get rid of the fully so could be a waste of money

5530 2018-12-03 15:25:11 Yes unfortunately that is the case. An import tax would only be applied against others sources such as Saudi, Nigeria etc. but what it will do is send a message to Alberta that the Federal government has its back plus point out the hypocrisy to the rest of Canada that imports oil

5532 2018-12-03 15:25:06 @RachelNotley You and your NDP party has no mandate to dictate the oil markets and act like your a stand alone Province. Oil prices around the world are down.pipe lines should of been built decades ago. There is no reason not to charge the US a higher price for our oil.
5533 2018-12-03 15:24:56 It was a pretty bad month for oil...

5538 2018-12-03 15:24:35 This is straight up *wrong*. We don't need oil so bad that it's worth doing this to our oceans and the marine life that depend on them.

5540 2018-12-03 15:24:23 I stand corrected! Although I have not heard any Eastern politicians every really champion a wester cause! Except NB now is saying they want Western Canadian oil!   finally after what 50 yrs?
5541 2018-12-03 15:24:17 Oil actually makes up less than 2 percent of their GDP. Its mostly because they have business (free) zones and they're involved in the production of petroleum related industries.

5545 2018-12-03 15:24:10 lets phase out Trudeau 2019, oil will be primary for decades to come, current tech including solar and wind not even close to 24/7 demand

As i said, many time, i am not that sure that OPEC+ will ever get an agreement given the pile of mess they produced in the last quarter.

Well done Saudi and Iran..... anyone of you wants to leave Opec today?
5567 2018-12-03 15:22:30 But if USD rises v CNY and oil doesn’t fall commensurately in USD, then I can buy oil in CNY & sell in USD and make Risk free profit, (adjusting for grade)

5570 2018-12-03 15:22:07 Question for Oil experts @a_coops1 @dollarfire @chigrl why would anyone think sanctions in Iran will bring a drop in supply from Iran. Iran shipped plenty through back door during the previous sanctions, why should it be any different this time ???
5571 2018-12-03 15:22:06 Qatar leaving OPEC, will be a big deal for months to come. This riff will have to be fixed if oil production is to be profitable for U.S. production.

5594 2018-12-03 15:19:06 And the actual gasoline prices in France have dropped commensurate with light crude oil prices. So narrative that "rising gasoline prices" is the cause of these riots is a total lie.

5675 2018-12-03 15:11:47 Those expensive Relief Factor snake oil pills? You'll get the same effect from drinking a shot of pickle juice every day.
5676 2018-12-03 15:11:42 @realDonaldTrump OPEC no longer has the market force that it had 40 years ago.  We and Russia are number 1 and number 2 in the world with oil production, and we stand to be exporters in a few years as shale oil comes online
5677 2018-12-03 15:11:32 um okay. if you have evidence then, by all means, show us?

the $'s been capped bc investors are fading Fed hiking by ~75-100bps cf their dot plot (maybe this is correct), oil *was* robust (petrodollar balances take mths to feed through), and EZ/China/EM hasn't blown up (yet)
5678 2018-12-03 15:11:32 Thank God . She should comb it and oil it well though

5681 2018-12-03 15:11:27 Do they run out? Peak oil was predicted in 1968, 1979, 1990 and 2004. All dead wrong. Fact is we've found 35bbls for every 1 we've burned since 1985. At current rates and extraction tech we've got supply for hundreds of years, maybe longer.

5688 2018-12-03 15:11:05 @zerohedge What oil producers really mean, “oil is down so we want big govt to fix prices just like they do for the $DJIA $QQQ $SPX “
5689 2018-12-03 15:11:05 @dbongino Saudi Arabia needs to be put in its place. Remember, a while back, when they put the squeeze on us; prices collasped, thousands lost their jobs & the economy tanked. Whether u are anti-oil or not, remember many businesses that support oil/gas were hurt dramatically.
5690 2018-12-03 15:11:04 I really be out here swishing oil around in my mouth for 15- 20 minutes a day and most of y’all don’t even floss ??????

5694 2018-12-03 15:10:44 Steve Barclay, he's as slippery as an oil slick and just as likeable. These people should have the EU blue badge sewn into the arms of their shirts (like our troops).
5695 2018-12-03 15:10:42 I get my oil changed at the quick lube over by your old house . Always had great experience with them
5696 2018-12-03 15:10:42 Thanks. I guess some of the producers didn't calculate as conservatively as should have on their all-in breakeven. Sucks for them and the soon to be "in the oil business" lenders.  (Me personally if it's that bad I'd let them foreclose.)

5710 2018-12-03 15:09:34 So closed out my IYT position. It should under perform a bit from this point forward. Machines are programmed to sell transports on OIL/Energy strength and I think we have some Oil strength ahead into year end. 

Best trade of the year. +192% on risk.
5711 2018-12-03 15:09:29 World eco is controlling oil palm price marketing and it is getting lower now, as to control forest degradation. Then does the swapping of sunflower, canola and soybean oil over palm oil has no effects on environment/degradation too? Cunning yankees
5712 2018-12-03 15:09:25 The most unethical article I have ever read was written in 2013 and titled "Why The FDA Is Right To Block Amarin's Push To Market Fish Oil To Millions"
We now know that FDA decision has cost many lives. The preponderance of evidence at the time supported expansion of the label.

5718 2018-12-03 15:08:57 I'm not. I'm attacking the presentation of a rigidly ideological, revanchist regime's military victory as some triumph of enlightenment over darkness. There's a reason they invented the oil miracle to construct a religious holiday out of a (minor, fortunately temporary) victory.

5735 2018-12-03 15:07:56 Yes... Its a mess... But I wanted to clean the stain out so I wouldn't always be reminded how stupid I am. I knocked an agrax over like less than a week ago. I saved most of that... This though... It wasn't just a tip. It was like I stepped into the octagon with the Nuln Oil

2. Good technique: heat 6 table spoons of oil of choice in pot with 5 pieces corn at ~%80 heat. Once popped, dump 1 cup corn in. Remove from heat for 1 min, agitating for even heat, place back on burner and continue usual process.

5745 2018-12-03 15:07:33 Sure expensive here. The dealership in Palm Springs was offering a 3 pack of synthetic oil changes for $99 USD, so $33 each. Here a reg oil change is $60. At least I won't be have to change it as often.....

5748 2018-12-03 15:07:13 Possibly true, but Saudi Arabia is the main causality factor in the recent price fall induced by increased production in Saudi Arabia in particular, probably. Not that much oil in Iran anymore. It's actually why they are researching nuclear power.

5764 2018-12-03 15:06:05 Thank you POTUS for releasing 1000 patents in the health and energy sectors!  Perhaps we can “go green” now and give those ideas a chance to replace existing obsolete energy sources (oil) and significantly improve health (anti-aging) of citizens!!!
5765 2018-12-03 15:06:03 Well, we do not grow much palm oil in Toulouse (the image used as illustration)
5766 2018-12-03 15:05:58 1 reason. This is how they are maintianing the value of the fiat us dollar. 

Oil goes down. The fed reserve will crash. 

This is our economy today.
5767 2018-12-03 15:05:58 The “free market” is not free in the oil industry because the shipping is controlled by govt not the market. If it was up to the market the KM pipeline expansion would be up and running. The govt is hoping this will be a $1.1 billion boost to royalties.

5771 2018-12-03 15:05:44 Listening to today’s news on @CBCVancouver. Issues on duty to consult First Nations and the dire consequences of climate change alongside stories on AB artificially inflating oil process and increasing global emissions. Why are we not *getting* this fundamental contradiction?
5772 2018-12-03 15:05:41 What is the true fundamental value of a barrel of oil if you take away artificial price supports like OPEC and environmental regulations? $35?

What if the oil industry was like wheat. There is no wheat OPEC. No restrictions on planting wheat or resistance to wheat pipelines.
5773 2018-12-03 15:05:38 Why #petro has to be backed by Oil? Coins like #XRP are back by nothing.

5776 2018-12-03 15:05:21 Let us examine the impact. Qatar exports approximately 500,000 bpd. So, it doesn't have much muscle in the oil area. Why the move to pull out? In simple terms, it wants some of Trump's attention by saying "We know you don't much like OPEC. So this move is for you". Losers.

5787 2018-12-03 15:04:24 Yup - I started using synthetics back in the 80s - made a surprising difference even to some old student beaters I drove.  (also most cars today use a 0W20 oil which is much more fluid than 10W30 that used to be common.
5788 2018-12-03 15:04:23 Another reason to look for investments outside oil and gas.
5789 2018-12-03 15:04:19 Stop using palm oil in your products which is killing the rainforests and everything that lives there.
5790 2018-12-03 15:04:18 في خطأ، oil equivalents هي وحدة قياس للطاقة، هنا المقارنة بكمية الطاقة المنتجة المعادلة للطاقة المخزنة في برميل نفط.

 إنتاج 100 مليون طن من الغاز الطبيعي يعادل 6 ملايين برميل نفط بالنسبة لكمية الطاقة المخزنة وهذا المقصود مش زيادة إنتاج النفط 10 اضعاف.
5791 2018-12-03 15:04:08 The #USA destroyed first democracy in #IRAN, placed puppet-dictator SHA OF PERZIA to get cheap oil. they are angry at Iranian people for liberating themmself fro m that usa-puppet dictator and not giving cheapp oil to the USA. Its ALL USA GREED
5792 2018-12-03 15:04:02 Personally I think it should be illegal to cut production of any product in order to bring up the price. If the world is glutted with oil, then there's no reason to cut production in order to raise the price. They have been robbing us blind for many years by doing so.
5793 2018-12-03 15:03:57 You must take more action against corporations that encourage the destruction of the rainforests to produce products such as palm oil. Rainforests are the lungs of the world and their destruction must be a major factor in global warming.

5796 2018-12-03 15:03:50 Did you know...The typical public transit rider consumes on average one half of the oil consumed by an automobile rider .
5797 2018-12-03 15:03:49 Because the oil cartel has such a strong grip on everything that it can crush any resistance to its reign.
5798 2018-12-03 15:03:49 Being a woman going into get an oil change almost always turns into ... “you need 4 tires, new windshield wipers, new front and rear brakes... basically ... bitch get a new car.” A man goes in... “ok sir $35 for your oil change” #why
5799 2018-12-03 15:03:40 Ok, but my point is directed towards understand why producers not making a profit pumping ("discounted oil from others"), don't hold onto the resource (in the ground) and sell when prices improve.

It just makes you read as elitist when this Rachael clearly embodies the Vow mentality we had moved on from. Rach, the trade to rUK wouldn’t be touched. It’s all gin, malt and oil

5806 2018-12-03 15:02:47 Weak Markit followed by strong ISM: orders and employment up, prices paid down (that's a function of oil).  Strange mix.

5808 2018-12-03 15:02:34 How can anyone take on massive shorts on a company that makes next level tech. How you call yourself a professional when you can't even see that $TSLA has been trading like a commodity for a few years now. Holding $TSLA as an investment since 2016 is like holding oil Lmao
5809 2018-12-03 15:02:34 pretty telling that a whole bunch of men responded to trudeau’s mention of social issues related to male-dominated oil and gas work by, without prompting, saying they totally don’t just do lines of coke off of dead hookers #ableg

5812 2018-12-03 15:02:23 Good morning! Today's headlines are:

President Trump Thanks Himself for Lower Oil Prices: "I appreciate all that you do, me"

5814 2018-12-03 15:02:15 These you-tube 'movies' are slap in the face of science, they are paid for by Big Oil, Coal, and many others who made billions from C-pollution and have a lot of to lose, if man-made #ClimateCrisis was taken seriously.

Real scientific data are very convincing, do your home work.
5815 2018-12-03 15:02:12 Here too. Garage w heater. New car has synthetic oil so should be even better.....
5816 2018-12-03 15:02:11 Eating oil based food since the festival falls in winters, one candle increases each day till all 8 are lit up on the last 8th day. World created in 7 days, hence celebration on the 8th !!

5834 2018-12-03 15:00:55 Last time US debt swelled & currency fell was 2004-2006: oil & commodities skyrocketed then everything crashed 2007. 

On a brighter note, Athabasca Oil is up big.

5843 2018-12-03 15:00:31 This is not true for 2 main reasons - it takes 6Kwh of electricity to pump 1 gallon of oil from the ground...then you have to transport it, refine it, transport it again, etc - None of this is calculated in these figures, they act as if petrol magically appears at the gas station
5844 2018-12-03 15:00:28 0時です。今日も一日、オイルと共に頑張りましょう。

5850 2018-12-03 15:00:07 Sterling is expected to fall by 10% against the dollar, without even thinking about the long term GDP loss, that means everything we import (oil, gas, food, cars, electrical goods, clothes, and everything else) will become more expensive. We have to keep buying food....

5854 2018-12-03 14:59:55 Virgin coconut oil HAHAHA
5855 2018-12-03 14:59:55 I'll change my own oil for 4 racks
5856 2018-12-03 14:59:54 Fish oil burps are the worst.
5857 2018-12-03 14:59:36 If the Canadian dollar is weak they will short oil to maintain. Hence cheap gas for now
5858 2018-12-03 14:59:36 partly, yes, but mostly it’s due to the volatility of oil prices in the world market (yez taray naging economist si ate gurl gloria arroyo is shaking)
5859 2018-12-03 14:59:35 Don't make fun of them. Gilles is a living example of the impacts of petroleum products on health. Oil sniffing/addiction is a tragedy.
5860 2018-12-03 14:59:30 The reason is simple: Large integrated companies like Suncor & Imperial are less affected & in fact profit (at the expense of everyone else)

They even buy the discounted oil from others, then sell it to themselves as an input, refine & sell it at full price. Cha-ching!
5861 2018-12-03 14:59:19 what's that? in fact, I'm dreaming... coconut oil, the scent of your body still lingers on sheets... i got a shot at you, you wouldn't reach, cock back, trigger release, pop that top, take a sip of your holiest water... I know I'm a part of your flow now 
5862 2018-12-03 14:59:02 I used to take Xanax to deal with my severe anxiety.  It turns out I'm magnesium deficient.  I believe it's something like 95% of Americans are.  CBD cannabidiol and magnesium oil have kept my anxiety checked.
5863 2018-12-03 14:59:01 Makes sense...with the US energy independent and a exporter of oil.  Its losing its ability to be a reserve currency.
5864 2018-12-03 14:58:47 One also has to ask why on earth the $ES hasn’t easily exceeded its Nov 8th wave 2 counter rally high of 2,818, despite the following news: 
 -Powell massive dovish pivot
 -Russia Saudi oil deal 
 -China trade truce hoopla
~Also if trade truce such a panacea why are TBonds green?
5865 2018-12-03 14:58:42 I see it's 'without oil and cheese'. Personally, therefore, I would add plenty of both -- and classify this jar as pesto-*makings*. Or are you saying pesto is best like this?
5866 2018-12-03 14:58:41 It’s oil attitude. It’s been very weak

5876 2018-12-03 14:58:09 How will this influence the #oil !? #OPEC
5877 2018-12-03 14:57:56 What is really sad about the affair is that Kuwait stole the Rumaila oil fields while #Iraq was invading #Iran at Reagan’s request. According to US Ambassador Glaspie , Bush I assured #Saddam that he would not interfere if #Iraq invaded Kuwait to retrieve them . 
5878 2018-12-03 14:57:54 Most of the money for state residents (as opposed to the state itself) comes from royalties on oil from state lands. If they also get money from pipeline fees, that's a small part of it.

5881 2018-12-03 14:57:43 #EiSamay Indian rupee registered its biggest single-day loss since August on Monday after crude oil prices rallied over 4 per cent in the international markets, local currency closed 87 paise, or 1.26 per cent, down at 70.46 against the US dollar.
5882 2018-12-03 14:57:41 A carbon tax? Really? Oil producers pay Gross Production Tax. We pay tax at the purchase of any petroleum products.

Wind farms get huge tax breaks, which we pay for.

We do not need new taxes.

5885 2018-12-03 14:57:27 Prediction: Oil bring in an old-schooler who will specifically cite Russell as an important anchor through the “reload.” 
I want to be wrong.
5886 2018-12-03 14:57:26 They’re a very small oil producer (2%), its mostly symbolic. Issues with Saudi Arabia & threats from Trump hastened the withdrawal.
5887 2018-12-03 14:57:21 Also, so is the implication that he DOES agree that climate change is real but he’s actually selling out the entire human race to make extra money from the oil industry???? 

That’s unforgivable. That’s a massive crime against humanity. That’s potentially more evil than...
5888 2018-12-03 14:56:58 Oil is the necessary for the economy but you could start the transition to an electric economy, CO2 neutral with nuclear but dopey leftists stop that from happening. The ones with fists as avatars usually
5889 2018-12-03 14:56:58 This is what the distraction of #brexit stubbornly stops us from dealing with and whether the dark money came from #fossilfuel business or #Russia it's just as likely oil is behind it.
5890 2018-12-03 14:56:24 I am tired of seeing articles exaggerating the amount of oil in ANWR. There is not a "trove" of oil there. Average estimates suggest there *might* be enough to supply the US for one year, two years at *maximum*.
5891 2018-12-03 14:56:20 They should be updated with the daily essential oil to include in the daily regimen.
5892 2018-12-03 14:56:19 America first is the greatest Con in the history of America

Trump continues to deny Climate Change so Russia, Putin and Saudi's can make billions. 

Trump is empowering Putin and the Saudi's by depending on Foreign oil

5895 2018-12-03 14:56:07 That is a beautiful answer , although not the reason behind this tradition. 

The reason has to do with the miracle of #Hanukkah, some oil and a lot of light  (my last hint) @SumannSharrma

5913 2018-12-03 14:54:28 Are all the fleet vehicles broken? Been on hold with Bell Fleet for more than 12 minutes. Just approve my oil change request. Thanks.
5914 2018-12-03 14:54:15 Oil companies in the U.S are such a disgrace.
5915 2018-12-03 14:53:59 Qatar just announced that it is out of OPEC. Qatar was member of the oil cartel since 1961.

It's believed the political fallout between Saudi & Qatar is intractable. 

Lesson to #Ethiopia, #Eritrea, #Djibouti, & #Somalia - DO NOT be a wrestling ring for the UAE/Saudis & Qataris

5927 2018-12-03 14:52:55 As an America you might be unaware that our former conservative PM Harper was a famous bloviator who accomplished nothing while giving away millions in Aid. In 9 years he couldn’t even build a pipeline to the west coast freeing Alberta oil. His epic failure haunts AB to this day!
5928 2018-12-03 14:52:43 I know for a fact they get everything for free. From housing, to food, heat, oil, water 
5929 2018-12-03 14:52:38 zzzz. Should have asked The Dick about outing @CIA asset @ValeriePlameWilson & starting the Iraq War to get Saddam's WMD that weren't there but oil for Halliburton was.
5930 2018-12-03 14:52:32 Pipeline usage is a profit sharing venture for all Alaskan resident’s. The more oil transported to Valdez, the more dividend allotment for Alaskan resident’s. It’s like everything else that’s pushed by 45, it’s about money. #SelfEnrichment

5935 2018-12-03 14:51:46 I just heard in a morning meeting that Qatar is removing itself from OPEC; while their oil production is the smallest of the participating nations, their natural gas production may make up for it.  So how will America compete?  We need to out-fart them! #MakeAmericaFartAgain
5936 2018-12-03 14:51:45 She’s talking about castor oil not Castrol oil lmfao

5949 2018-12-03 14:50:50 Hey genius. If you could actually read you’d notice I said “to international (meaning non-US) markets.” When Harper left office over 99% of Canadian oil went to only one market, the US. That’s why Canadian prices are so long. Jeez. 
5950 2018-12-03 14:50:48 last week anton told me that if i wanted to go outside without adequate clothes on i should rub oil all over my body to keep myself warm and i haven't been able to stop thinking about it lol

5963 2018-12-03 14:49:45 There will always be oil. What will make it unviable in the future is;
How much it costs to extract.
The fact that the world is rapidly moving post-oil. 
It’s not a simple issue of just ‘having it’. Ask Venezuela or Afghanistan.

5979 2018-12-03 14:48:30 It been over 3 years when will the Notley government stop the equalization payments?

6011 2018-12-03 14:46:16 Will someone at @FoxBusiness tell Stuart @Varneyco that it's not the frackers causing the U.S. oil production increase. It's horizontal drilling.
6012 2018-12-03 14:46:15 If i don’t get my oil changed today someone slap me
6013 2018-12-03 14:46:06 Otherwise: the market is, there is no trade, oil cannot be bought in Russia. Ie. Open 1-2 banks for foreign exchange transactions (foreign exchange contracts).
6014 2018-12-03 14:46:01 GM plant closure and moments after Alberta announces forced oil production cuts Justin announces on Twitter he’s giving away 50 MILLION. Disgustjng
6015 2018-12-03 14:45:55 When I get down in the dumps about how we’re all gonna die in like 6 months because of all that AquaNet I used in the 80s, I try to set things right by burning a car, throwing some extra tires on the fire, dumping some motor oil in a river.

It really helps.
6016 2018-12-03 14:45:55 For example, I have now crude oil at a bargain price. But I can not provide an influx of money from abroad (Iran, Europe). Banks cannot reread money into my accounts now. Both Iran and Europe cannot get oil at a bargain price. Unlock (give Tranche) to pay to Russia for oil.
6017 2018-12-03 14:45:48 The only thing that is “vile” here is snake oil salesmen like you trying to profit off of the suffering of desperate parents.

6023 2018-12-03 14:45:34 As a result, Europeans have better public transportation, fewer cars per capita, and a MUCH higher percentage of smaller cars with smaller, more fuel-efficient engines. Americans are extremely wasteful with motor fuel and that's the key reason why we consume so much oil.
6024 2018-12-03 14:45:29 Trying to get my car in for oil change, not happening.  Other things not going well.

6027 2018-12-03 14:45:09 "He said no more than 35 years of oil and gas production remain" which in other words means "The oil will run out". And you've just said he's right, which by my count makes two occasions on which it's been said oil is running out, just in this one conversation, nevermind decades.
6028 2018-12-03 14:45:08 Dear @Fallout and @BethesdaStudios 

Getting tired of spending at least 40 oil on turrets setting up extractors and then suddenly losing connection. 

Is this your way of filtering out all the junk we horde? Make us spend it then disconnect us so we lose it? #Fallout76

6031 2018-12-03 14:45:00 If we invest it can go a helluva way.aybe bows the the time to pivot. Because there’s a ton of proof we need to rely less on oil. Look at SAT pictures of Nprthern Alberta. Look at SAT photos of the Deltas near Lagos in Nigeria. Yes. We need oil. But time lessen our need.

6038 2018-12-03 14:44:52 On a political and business level,  it's all about the money. Just looking at the news that Exxon had global warming models and built their offshore oil rigs to compensate for rising ocean levels and locations in the Arctic they could drill once the ice melted.

6040 2018-12-03 14:44:48 The question mark in your headline belies both known science on these oils and your own reporting. No, essential oils are not and never have been medicine. They are literally 21st century Snake Oil sold by MLM cults.

6085 2018-12-03 14:41:10 Hi! The Body Oil contains loss of vitamin A oils that your own skin will convert to retinol, this is a stable and safe form of getting retinol into your skin. RetiNOIDS however are synthetically made, super potent, and not for use during pregnancy... so in short, yes!
6086 2018-12-03 14:41:09 Why does getting an oil change take so long

6089 2018-12-03 14:40:43 Agreed that notation is not automatic. cash. Treasury or NY Fed (ESF) can cut a check, they can sell or transfer weapons or assets out the back door or launder in profits from war zones (oil sales, etc). My guess - ESF trading and securities fraud through Treasury & HUD are big.

6092 2018-12-03 14:40:31 a burning topic: trade in oil and oil products (transcontinental sales). The whole question is in the Banking sector (Russia is different from all countries on the planet). There is no exchange of currency transactions (There is no access to money from the outside in Russia now).

6101 2018-12-03 14:39:42 I understand but you’re oversimplifying it. There are many variables that can not be planned for. In Canada, Alberta is planning on cutting back oil output. This will impact the local economy and thus tax payments. I’m oversimplifying now but you get my point.

6120 2018-12-03 14:38:16 Why would we not want to tap the oil?  It’s below ground - no impact above ground.  Drill baby drill.  The oil is better for America than a “pristine view of a wilderness”.
6121 2018-12-03 14:38:10 In general, both the government and citizens of Alaska are in favor of responsible development of Alaskan oil, including the ANWR. Most of the existing North Slope production is from state and native lands. ANWR is federal land, so the state is not in control.
6122 2018-12-03 14:37:58 Don’t think I’ll ever get used to the taste of black seed oil. Just glad you only have to take a teaspoon once a day. I take it in the morn so I have the rest of the day to kill the after taste lol.

6130 2018-12-03 14:37:23 We *must* get Alberta oil to the coast.  We must.  If the pipeline is a “no”, then how would you propose getting it there?
6131 2018-12-03 14:37:06 Why do people want to continue getting our oil from other countries instead of getting it ourselves?  It seems idiotic that people want our country to be in debt and fail.
6132 2018-12-03 14:37:06 I'm not sure I could do the Love Oil then! I am quite frisky enough without it!

6146 2018-12-03 14:36:07 Do stocks care about big drops in #oil? Maybe not.

Oil down 22% in November, yet S&P 500 up 1.8% for the month.

In fact, since '83 (using reliable oil data) there have now been 8 months that saw oil down 20% or more.

The S&P 500 gained 7 of those months.
6147 2018-12-03 14:36:07 I'll bring the oil

6156 2018-12-03 14:34:49 It celebrates taking back the temple that the Greek Antiochus stole from the Jews, and re-dedicating it. The only “miracle,” and not mentioned in Maccabees, is finding a flask of olive oil to light the candles in the temple, enough to last only 8 days. There, I gave you something
6157 2018-12-03 14:34:44 True, also oil $ made some of the most corrupt and least productive countries super wealthy. Soviet Union wouldn't have lasted for so long if oil and gas exports didn't generate billions in easily earned foreign currency

6163 2018-12-03 14:34:28 One of the drivers of North Slope development is that throughput in the trans-Alaska pipeline is down to 500k barrels per day vs. 2 million originally. If it continues to drop, it could eventually render the pipeline inoperable, which would trap unproduced oil on the North Slope.
6164 2018-12-03 14:34:27 @Varneyco Are you happy for all the oil workers that are fixing to be out of a job. You need education on the oil field and oil workers. Come on Varney cheap oil is not good for everyone

6167 2018-12-03 14:34:08 Why work on climate change when your goal is to warm the arctic for shipping lanes & oil drilling?
6168 2018-12-03 14:34:08 Anytime any government implements a plan saying it is good for the tax payer it always screws us in the end. Look at Notleys early days of wanting to shut down the oil industry. Her and Trudeau are living the dream.. Shut it all down.

6174 2018-12-03 14:33:36 I’ve said for a long time I consider OPEC to be a dead organization walking. I wonder if Qatar's withdrawal (some sort of Doha-Tehran gambit to offload sanctioned oil?) will be the catalyst for OPEC to finally collapse.

6176 2018-12-03 14:33:23 It's an 8-day Jewish holiday celebrating their overthrow of oppressors and rededication of the Second Temple in Jerusalem. The 8 days stand for the 8 days the sacred lamps were lit with a tiny bit of remaining, blessed oil.
6177 2018-12-03 14:33:20 e e if money doesn't matter why are you charging me for an oil change?
6178 2018-12-03 14:33:19 It doesn’t solve the problem but at least gives a relief valve.  Alberta’s oil production cut is leading to an 11% gain for WCS oil to $24.35.  Can Crude Index ETF now up 40% in early trading.  Drivers will feel the pinch later in the week.

6182 2018-12-03 14:33:04 Yes. It could be simple economics, like US exporting Alaska oil to Asia, rather than transporting it to east coast, which is controversial
6183 2018-12-03 14:32:59 What would Trump tweet (or do) if the US exported 90% of oil prod like Canada instead of 20% as current? What about 50%? He's just very, very pro-American. #OOTT #crudeoil #oil

6215 2018-12-03 14:29:48 Shame on you @GovMikeHuckabee for attacking @Ocasio2018 A Green Sustainable revolution is good for the climate and good for the economy. Maybe not so good for oil and coal corporations though. #ClimateAction #GreenNewDeal #WakeUpAmerica

6219 2018-12-03 14:29:34 CNN blames French riots on "a leap in the wholesale price of oil worldwide" which they say is partly due to Trump's sanctions on Iran.

But European oil prices have *fallen* 30% in the past two months. Anything to blame Trump, instead of Macron.
6220 2018-12-03 14:29:20 And yet... Obama made us the biggest producer of oil in the world. Doesn’t sound like something you’d do if you took climate change seriously as an extinction-level threat.
6221 2018-12-03 14:29:18 All you need is a packet of sugar and a little bit of olive oil.

6225 2018-12-03 14:29:02 @SenatorBurr 
As your constituent, I ask that you oppose seismic blasting off of our coast.  It is devastating to marine life. Please be a Senator for our tourism and seafood industries. Taking money from oil industries and doing their bidding is not right and you know it.
6226 2018-12-03 14:28:52 I am just wondering the angle is...gifts of Russian oil stock after he departs in 2020?...
6227 2018-12-03 14:28:51 Explain or include if any major events affect the way to look at MP/intraday like election, currency devaluation, crude oil, central bank policy rate change, CPI, Foreign funds etc. Include all available parameters and explain.
6228 2018-12-03 14:28:50 Pls, where's Chief Ubah, Capital Oil managing Director?
6229 2018-12-03 14:28:49 Too much is made of the word "pristine." That doesn't mean that it's a crown jewel -- just that it's untouched by non-natives. Alaskan oil and gas regulations are HIGHLY protective of the environment and that's one of the reasons it's so expensive.
6230 2018-12-03 14:28:47 Hi Raj, given that there is no renewable vs oil capex reporting by companies, we look at new finance flows into the sectors (new equity & bond issuance as well as syndicated loans) - by renewable energy companies vs. oil&gas companies - happy to discuss about this...
6231 2018-12-03 14:28:40 Scotland hasn't done very well at all as part of the UK. Hundreds of billions of pounds worth of oil and gas to fund English wars and weapons. Still waiting for the oil to "run out".
6232 2018-12-03 14:28:37 Reminds me of when I went to spain and they steamed my soya milk creating a hybrid coffee drink where the milk and coffee was like water and oil
6233 2018-12-03 14:28:37 So i cleaned my bag and i realized how tito i am.

i'm the friend who brings wipes, tissue, white flower, alcohol, oil control film, and a comb in his bag.
6234 2018-12-03 14:28:34 If you’re wanting it to grow your beard not really. What it’s meant to do is to keep moisterized so it doesn’t get dry and scratchy. You can just use coconut oil and that works great
6235 2018-12-03 14:28:33 It won't be long Bubba for the 1275 Gold but I must say that oil will hang in there above 50 and return into the 60 range.  I have been wrong before, so I hear. LOL
6236 2018-12-03 14:28:30 yall are both talented tf. I started using oil painting and it's so hard. I'm still using watercolor...

6238 2018-12-03 14:28:25 Lost were the Trojans
The Golden Shields
Of protection

Found was the oil
A spill, slick
Between her breasts

Happy were they
To receive fealty
From his cock

While nipples, erect
Stood watch
From mounds
of heavenly flesh

6240 2018-12-03 14:28:23 There’s no such thing as TMI here . I agree that a woman’s natural sexual responses to your stimulation are often moisturizing enough, but know even with the wettest woman some additional lube or oil add to the experience. This is especially true with marathon sessions.
6241 2018-12-03 14:28:18 Long ago, a king forbade the Jews to practice their religion, and filled their holy temple with Greek gods. A brave Jewish group of fighters, the Maccabees, rebelled and won against all odds. They cleaned up their temple and although the oil they had for their holy lamp was (1/2)

6251 2018-12-03 14:27:48 I want to donate £1m to the dam fund. How do I donate it to the right hands
6252 2018-12-03 14:27:45 Considering the gap in oil prices are based on a lack of refinery capacity for our particular kind of crude oil, that would be a good place to start. Refined oil still sells for world market price, even shipped by rail
6253 2018-12-03 14:27:44 1.4% GDP growth rate, 11.2% inflation rate, 3.2% population growth rate, 23 billion dollar budget for a population of about 200million,112 billion dollar debt profile, 360 Naira to a dollar, Major Revenue is from crude oil(mono economy) 18.8% unemployment rate.

6262 2018-12-03 14:27:00 Good Monday morning. As a black lady told me @ a supermarket check-out line here in Oakland, CA many years ago: : "Same old oil, brand new bottle!"
6263 2018-12-03 14:26:55 Have you tried essential oils? I would try diffusing lavender in your home.  If you use good quality oil such as doTerra you can also rub a drop on your hands and then massage Bone’s ear tips. Hopefully that helps a little.

6265 2018-12-03 14:26:44 also is something to be said for the fact that in cases of extreme power, people are never held accountable in life.

6270 2018-12-03 14:26:22 Also targeting the auto industry makes sense beyond the very solid land use, GHG reasons.

They are a key ally of oil, but if ICE makers struggle and EV makers thrive, you can have an auto industry ends up aligned against oil.
6271 2018-12-03 14:26:16 Agreed. Many Sask light oil producers will have less than 10,000 bbl/day in ALTA and be exempt from the cut, ontop of the benefits you highlighted.

These are not the issues of the day CBC news network maybe time to refocus? Confront Notley and Kenney about their blindness #cbc #takeyourseat
6277 2018-12-03 14:25:51 Yes, and the thousands of oil workers who've lost their jobs in Alberta?
6278 2018-12-03 14:25:49 Thank the Saudis. Khasoggi was the sacrifice for cheaper oil barrels  RT @Fresh_Logic: Gas is $1.94 and I just wanna say I’m thankful.
6279 2018-12-03 14:25:35 Oops, I didn't factor in the climate scientists riding the gravy train of occasional government grants, because I was so hung up on the billionaire oil and gas executives whose literal billions of US dollars - billions! - depend on our continued use of oil and gas.
6280 2018-12-03 14:25:34 Ham slices, diced pineapples, parmesan cheese and a hunt of garlic oil. Yummy.
6281 2018-12-03 14:25:34 So that would be the same Ian Wood who said there was plenty of oil, it was all gone, moved his company to a tax haven and then said there was plenty of oil.

I like paying 99c/L . I don’t want them to force the price back up to make Big Oil happy. But if they do (they are), Big Oil should be paying much higher royalties and taxes
6284 2018-12-03 14:25:25 I may call bullshit on this one, Gerald Butts is on record saying Canada should be fossil fuel free and PM socks said he would like to shutdown the oil sands.  Action over words would be the way to handle this crisis.

6288 2018-12-03 14:25:19 The decline in 2016 was due to the severe drop in oil price. The demand for heavy mining equipment in late 2015 and early 2016 dropped globally along with oil price

It was only logical that it rebounded in 2017

What you do:
Taste a teaspoon of olive oil, wait 5 seconds & if it burns down your throat = high in oleocanthal

6415 2018-12-03 14:15:16 Terrible. Like we are in the oil business in government?  First they buy a pipeline, then railway cars and now telling the oil companies production limits?  Could we please get back to providing good schools, hospitals, and infrastructure?

6500 2018-12-03 14:10:15 Unsustainable production of palm oil has indeed caused devastating impact on rainforests, which is why RSPO & its members are working to improve the way palm oil is produced. As the most efficient vegetable oil crop, and with growing demand worldwide, palm oil is here to stay 1/2

6527 2018-12-03 14:07:47 One has to wonder why Ethiopian people do not have their own oil refineries producing unleaded gas and diesel fuel. Most certainly corruption has a lot to do with it. But with proper leadership and half the time we can be producing up to 100,000 barrels a day. That’s a fact.
6528 2018-12-03 14:07:43 oh goodie now we can rely on Saudi Arabia even more for their oil. how much did that cost? lol

6533 2018-12-03 14:07:17 Zanzo na amsa hular nan
6534 2018-12-03 14:07:07 So this story blames the rise in the first six months of oil prices on Trump, yet fails to mention that oil prices in France have actually fallen 30% the last 2 months
6535 2018-12-03 14:07:03 This reminds me of when Saddam Hussein was getting chased out of Kuwait and he lit the oil fields on fire as he was leaving.
6536 2018-12-03 14:07:03 Obama made US oil independent, at cost of fracking. Few talk about it. Idea we are chasing oil over solar or wind only bc power owns oil.  #banfracking
6537 2018-12-03 14:07:02 so matcha became the same thing as wasabi, olive oil, parmesan etc, as you probably never tried the real thing

6544 2018-12-03 14:06:33 You'd be surprised that China is still a net importer but has been producing oil since 1950 lol
6545 2018-12-03 14:06:31 Complimentary free donuts while waiting for an oil change makes the wait a little more tolerable 
6546 2018-12-03 14:06:28 Bush got us into the never ending war in Iraq...all because the UAE and Saudi Arabia were scared that Saddham was going to march down the coast and take their oil empires just like he did in Kuwait.
6547 2018-12-03 14:06:28 But clean energy is expensive! And you'll still need batteries which are even worse than oil. Truth be told, even if all our Climate Change policies were 100 percent efficient, it would only reduce the temperature by insignificant numbers. Climate is natural, money won't fix it.
6548 2018-12-03 14:06:26 RUSSIA AND SAUDIS ARE SAID TO DIFFER ON HOW TO SHARE OIL CUTS
RUSSIA SAID IT WOULD CUT OUPUT BY A MAXIMUM OF 150,000 B/D
6549 2018-12-03 14:06:22 No, I am correct. The menorah lit in the holy temple had seven branches. The miracle of the oil was on that menorah. The resembling candelabra we light today has eight branches to commemorate the miracle of 8 days.
6550 2018-12-03 14:06:22 Exactly.
Big oil and AIPAC own him so far.
My hope is Bernie runs or endorses a true lefty.
Do not be surprised if Michele Obama runs.
She would thin the herd immediately. 
Dem corporate owned centrists, old guard GOP will make her POTUS.
6551 2018-12-03 14:06:19 Yes men , and nato countries have no need to attack eachother for oil , however tnose countrues not controlled by rothschild central banks with large oil reserves and huge economies like russia and  china who oppose the globalists and their NWO agenda and oil grabs are being
6552 2018-12-03 14:06:12 Though she has never run a fortune 500 company let alone a fortune 50 company like Sheryl Sandberg Michele Obama recently expressed  how she could do it better dovetailing Barack's recent comment that he know more about oil production than industry executives  .#Obama
6553 2018-12-03 14:06:04 Yeah but the thing is it will always be regulated. Before OPEC the USA controlled the oil price. Now the power is shifting back. Oil will never trade freely as long as only a few countries produce enough for export
6554 2018-12-03 14:05:58 Not only Calgary Oil Workers from all over Canada come to Alberta.

6556 2018-12-03 14:05:52 Did you have ur eyes and ears shut when Obama was President? How about when all that oil leaked in the Gulf of Mexico? Remember that? How did they test for it during his presidency?
6557 2018-12-03 14:05:52 Qatar is a natural gas producer; OPEC is laser focused on crude oil.  The market for Nat Gas exports is growing 10% a year.  No need to associate w OPEC and take mandatory production cuts.
6558 2018-12-03 14:05:47 았 ㅋㅋ 주말은 박터질려나ㅠ 그럼 밤에하는수박에 없지만..
6559 2018-12-03 14:05:38 Why are we buying oil from Saudi? Canada just cut their oil Prices by 8.9% to maintain prices.

6578 2018-12-03 14:03:56 Exxon invented the lithium ion battery in the 1970s then ditched it. In the 1980s oil industry bought and sat on battery patents. This a very politically savvy and active industry. (It's not either or).
6579 2018-12-03 14:03:56 I think once you become aware, you cannot go back. I had already given up @Nutella and some peanut butters because of Palm Oil. Now I’ve moved to all chocolate. Will add things weekly and look for alternatives. Thanks for the info about milk :)

6608 2018-12-03 14:01:17 The only reason they havnt come after our oil in canada is vecause we are already giving away our oil at 10 dollar a barrel prices and the rothschilds already own our centrsl bank of canada and because of that fact , our leaders like all nato leaders are rothschild puppets and

6617 2018-12-03 14:00:51 FACT OF THE DAY: The Renewable Fuel Standard could supplant 652,000 barrels of oil per day, but domestic oil production has increased over recent years by more than 5 million barrels per day.

6637 2018-12-03 13:59:59 Commodities are up because less tariffs.

Since commodities (Oil) are up then US inflation expectations are up.

Since inflation expectations are up then future fed funds rate is up.

So therefore $USD is up.

Wrong. Scotland receives the cubed-root of hee-haw. ALL Scotland's oil & gas revenue goes straight to "Ex-Regio" & NOT Scotland's balance sheet.  Done by WM to make Scotland look poorer than it actually is. Enjoy your fleecing.

6678 2018-12-03 13:56:44 Bold action. How do we get bold action among community minded? People are interested in each other’s wellbeing but not secure in their own.

6732 2018-12-03 13:51:46 Just gotta say. My mom was afflicted and when I became her caregiver I started putting coconut oil on her toe nails and her nails slowly became normal. Unrefined coconut oil, cold pressed. None of the stuff her doctor gave her over the years worked.

6740 2018-12-03 13:51:15 Right wing tends to include climate change denial in its ideological portfolio in order to allow unhindered profiteering by Big Oil + fracking etc. Also think about carbon footprint of imagined Brexiter trade deals from countries on other side of world.
6741 2018-12-03 13:51:08 Oil lasting longer than expected seems more like a pleasant surprise than a miracle.

6746 2018-12-03 13:50:40 We have more oil to drill for than you do that we don't keep in reserves idiot. Also you're an idiot we got electric car and you still joining 20th century while world is already in 2018. Dinosaurs. We'll just sanction you. Simple as that.

6748 2018-12-03 13:50:28 RTs> The oil thing is somewhat questionable because of that little thing where people have to note where they're employed on individual donations. This is where stuff like this gets completely skewed and overrides individual intent and rather muddies the waters...

6750 2018-12-03 13:50:13 Is Oil Well the real issue?
6751 2018-12-03 13:50:12 Big oil's loss is the planet's gain for a healthier energy source.
6752 2018-12-03 13:50:08 The U.S. might give them millions but none actually gets to the citizens.  Their issues don't come from the people or policies. Rather it is because the leaders bet it all on oil! They borrowed against future earnings. Just like TRUMP did when he gave tax breaks to the wealthy!
6753 2018-12-03 13:50:06 @TheCurrentCBC Please don’t let any pol get away with saying the Ford gov cut the price of gas. The switch to cheaper winter gas and the drop in market oil lead to lower prices. Ford had nothing to do with it.

6755 2018-12-03 13:49:56 What a selfish tosser Ian Wood is! Anything he and his family can personally profit from becomes his political crusade.

He has no credibility left when it comes to oil and gas after his predictions pre-referendum in 2014.

Why believe him about fish?
6756 2018-12-03 13:49:51 @segalink is right on this.Billions was spent on oil search in lake Chad against experts advice,pple were kidnapped on this project,some probably killed.LPG usage is not properly promoted particularly in d north were 90% are still on firewood.HE IS ATTENDING CLIMATE CHANGE!#MUMU
6757 2018-12-03 13:49:49 Is the palm oil you  use certified sustainable by the RSPO?
6758 2018-12-03 13:49:47 True. I just heard 2 people say he was the best Present since HST. As an ex pres, he could have tried to atone for his family's racist and Nazi supporting past. He could have atoned for Iran Contra. He could have atoned for lying to start the first Gulf over Saudi oil.
6759 2018-12-03 13:49:47 This is definitely true. We can no longer plead ignorance or turn a blind eye. The consumer  vey powerful. If we stop buying they will have to adapt. I’ve just given up my favourite chocolate @GalaxyChocolate until they make one without Palm Oil because of the #orangutans.

6761 2018-12-03 13:49:42 It was shocking to know that production cost is less than $ 10 per barrel ( As per comments made in PM's meeting with oil producers ) which can be sold at any price because of cartel & super taxation by Governments.

6774 2018-12-03 13:48:18 We have electricic cars now dumb shit and hydrodynamic energy as well as wind and solar. Also nuclear. We don't need oil. You do. Because you don't even make your own goods. You have nothing. Just like Russia has nothing people want. When is last time world lined up for RU movies
6775 2018-12-03 13:48:17 Good move by Qatar, their oil production has been dropping and they are the big dog in the world in Natural gas.  Plus they are tired of MBS screwing with them. They will do fine. I was there 2 weeks ago and they don’t appear to be hurting.
6776 2018-12-03 13:48:09 @RachelNotley Madam Primer can you explain to this dumb blue collar oil patch work how the hell is oil down to record lows and gas prices keep going up? I don’t understand it should be as simple as if I eat I shit, oil goes down gas should go down and the tax revenue you collect.

6783 2018-12-03 13:47:19 I said Scottish oil....not snake oil...wind yer neck in. It’s in Scotland’s waters. Anyways...the question was put to John Thomson...have you see him?

6792 2018-12-03 13:46:45 Thanks for sharing the data! Agree Qatar is a puny in oil, but an LNG giant. Quitting OPEC is more about its spat with Saudi Barbaria & Gulf politics--it's a psychological blow to OPEC cartel. It's a signal that bad days are ahead for the power of OPEC cartel. Will it break up?

6881 2018-12-03 13:40:14 I’m really trying to avoid taking shots at Alberta. It’s hard to pivot from the economic security of oil and what it’s done for them. And Canada.
6882 2018-12-03 13:40:09 I definitely agree we need less hype, but I also think it's going to take more time for solutions that work to rise to the surface - our industry is still full of charlatans and snake oil sales people, I don't think for a second that "big bucks blockchain" is faring any better...
6883 2018-12-03 13:40:09 全ての油という油に感謝しているよ。
6884 2018-12-03 13:40:07 Some details on Alberta's oil production cut:  
1) Reduces production by 325,000 barrels per day (8.7 per cent reduction).
2) Is applied at operator level with 1st 10,000 barrels/day excluded to protect smaller producers.  
3) Applies to oil sands and conventional oil (Thread)
6885 2018-12-03 13:40:06 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.

6887 2018-12-03 13:39:51 @ericgarland Any thoughts on the Gilet Jaunes in France? Looks fairly beneficial for Putin/declining oil powers:

- Weaken Macron (strengthen Le Pen, Mélenchon)
- Show the world that taxes on gas/diesel are a huge political risk
- Create chaos
6888 2018-12-03 13:39:51 As if all oil - producing countries are bereft of administrators that they are asking the help our chowkidar ..... What a joke of the year 2018 !
6889 2018-12-03 13:39:49 Maybe the single scientist with a known political and religious agenda and known financial ties to the oil industry isn't the best source for finding out what the other scientists are actually up to. Just a thought.
6890 2018-12-03 13:39:46 Rupee ended weaker against the US Dollar, tracking some recovery in Dollar globally and rise in oil prices. Dollar buys, likely for FPI outflows weighed on the unit. Oil importers' Dollar buys also disrupted the sentiment. However, some exporters' Dollar sales limited losses.
6891 2018-12-03 13:39:41 France is on fire, no media coverage, fake news will not cover the rioting of citizens who are protesting the massive gasoline taxes imposed to halt climate change! Prior called global warming,total B.S.! How will you charge electric cars without, oil, coal or natural gas!

6901 2018-12-03 13:39:07 but why have ugly windfarms when you can have beautiful coal combustion plants?

Talking broadly about social issues is personal to socially conservative ruralites

Taking broadly about economic issues either sounds like snake oil sales or goes right over their head.

You have to talk specifically to their situation

Who is using the oil/gas/coal and for what? To produce our clothes, laptops, cars, boxes, furniture...
6925 2018-12-03 13:37:28 In just a week, we’ve seen a trade truce, the Fed all but priced out and a made-in-Canada oil bounceback. It may all be transitory, but the risk-on trade may at least last through year-end.

6948 2018-12-03 13:35:59 The fact that we’re still fighting a proxy war in the Middle East over oil resources and causing wildly increasing humanitarian crises is the entry point for what to know about Bush’s legacy.

6950 2018-12-03 13:35:50 Why can't CNN ever get the cause and effect correct. Wholesale oil prices are down +/- 30% in Europe. They are not rioting because price of oil is up, they are rioting because of the new tax on gas.

6965 2018-12-03 13:34:51 Be sure and study what oil prices did soon after OPEC meetings 174, 173, 172 and 171 ( or as far back as you'd like to go) #OOTT  Google and a chart are your friends.
6966 2018-12-03 13:34:45 Today we use 100 million barrels of oil every single day. There are no politics to change that. There are no rules to keep that oil in the ground. 

So we can’t save the world by playing by the rules. Because the rules have to be changed.

7012 2018-12-03 13:30:01 . . . into consideration customer feedback, overall performance, as well as the close similarities between both body oil products, we have taken the difficult decision to retire the Superskin™ Treatment Oil for Body from our range. We are sorry for any disappointment. - Ellie
7013 2018-12-03 13:30:00 Russia & Saudi Arabia agreed to extend OPEC’s efforts to stabilize oil markets, Russian President Vladimir Putin said over the weekend, as the broader coalition of producers inches closer to a deal this week - Market Watch
7014 2018-12-03 13:29:49 Trump to MBS: "Look, I really want those arms sales, so I don't want to blame the murder on you. Can you help out?" MBS to Trump: "No problem, I will increase oil production which will lower gasoline prices and you will be big hero." Quid pro quo!
7015 2018-12-03 13:29:28 Hello! We've monitored customer interest and feedback of both of our Body Oils and while both have been received positively, the Superskin™ Dry Oil for Body has really stood out in terms of its popularity, as well as its overall ease of application for customers.

7017 2018-12-03 13:29:05 Question:  

If olive oil is made from olives, and corn oil is made from corn...

....what do they make baby oil out of?

because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
7026 2018-12-03 13:28:18 So free prescriptions cost us £2 billion? £12 billion in 2008? The oil does not belong to oil companies. It belongs to the people of Scotland. Let me guess that you support Rangers, before I look at your bio!
7027 2018-12-03 13:28:16 Shame on ALL of the government leaders in America that turn their heads to combatting global warming. Shame on you for choosing Oil & Gas donations over global sustainability. This  issue goes way beyond party lines America. Thank you COP24 Summit.@SenSanders
7028 2018-12-03 13:28:14 Jagmeet and the NDP - advocate destroying Alberta’s oil industry while importing unethical oil from the House of Saud.  You hypocritical jack**s

7032 2018-12-03 13:27:59 Thank you for recognizing the historical connection between the Jewish People & the Old City of Jerusalem. Your joining us in celebrating the miracle of the oil used to reconsecrate the Jewish Temple, reaffirming our millennia-old connection with it, is surprising & appreciated
7033 2018-12-03 13:27:59 Small footnote (also): Qatar is huge for natural gas (not oil) so likely knows it has limited influence within OPEC & can do little to influence its policies anyways with small % of worlds oil reserves
7034 2018-12-03 13:27:53 Our Oil and Gas Company is selling Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG). We are open for Buyers from France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, Hungary and Denmark. 20000 MT available this December, good price. Just email your LOI, & we require 50% DP <alexeiross@bk.ru>

As a citizen of Canada, I call on the Prime Minister to go further & condemn specifically the actions of SA’s Crown Prince MBS,  human rights violations in SA & the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. BAN Saudi oil! END arms sales! REDEEM yourself after Cuba
7036 2018-12-03 13:27:43 The oil price has always been controlled but now that basically three men control the narrative, OPEC is trying to flex it's muscles. And some are leaving because of geopolitical tensions and it's lessening power as a group
7037 2018-12-03 13:27:34 Using MCT oil supplements with highest concentrations of caprylic acid or medium chain triglycerides would kick start the body before intense workouts since it is metabolized into energy much faster than sugar.   #ketogenicdiet #weightlossjourney

7040 2018-12-03 13:27:30 Get yourself a bottle of rosemary oil and smell it when you feel sick. Really helps
7041 2018-12-03 13:27:25 The U.S. is living giving the back to future. Oil is sinking on interest for energy as the the world is increasingly moving to renewable energies.
7042 2018-12-03 13:27:20 Get a pure filtered one from a pharmacy if you can... I’ve never used the plant... Try vitamin E oil as well.

7044 2018-12-03 13:27:11 Why the man made islands stacked with military emplacements in the South China sea?
  Fact remains the Chinese communist cant be TRUSTED, plus XI in Venezuela along with the Russians for their oil reserves , both have a great influence in Venezuela.

7047 2018-12-03 13:26:59 My 1st thought was that this was an over reaction - a totally predicted one - but over-reaction still.  2nd thought was unless OPEC cuts supply, oil prices will fall again.  3rd thought was better a cease fire in trade war than further hostilities, but it is just a pause.
7048 2018-12-03 13:26:58 I have a lot to learn..  and don't have any more midnight oil to burn  #gn xo
7049 2018-12-03 13:26:56 1/3 So now we have a production reduction in oil for Alberta. Let’s be clear the oil that is being sold is to our one customer the U.S. if we had that pipe to tide water we still be making world oil price for our resource. Time to take stock who our enemies are at this movement.

7054 2018-12-03 13:26:47 @_minniemodel An innocent purchase this morning I didn't have my reading glasses to read the detail .I bought a Batchelors Pasta and Sauce in a packet and it contained Palm Oil. It did also contain Sunflower why can't they useful  Rape seed too which is grown in the UK
7055 2018-12-03 13:26:39 Typical to try and hide behind a single riot in a country what you know nothing about. I wouldnt be surprised if you couldnt pinpoint Paris on a map. The French citizens are rioting for also many other reasons. Shortsighted like justifying drilling for oil in Alaska. Cmon man...

7060 2018-12-03 13:26:26 Qatar's oil contribution to OPEC is marginal.  It pumps near 600,000 barrels a day of the almost 25 million barrels a day from all cartel members.

7063 2018-12-03 13:26:12 If you saw the oil tank from the 60s in our garage and how inefficient the heating system was (hundreds of dollars a month in winter to get house to 68 degrees), you might have run away screaming. We did ask for heating costs, but I think prior owner was an icicle in winter.
7064 2018-12-03 13:26:11 I have just noticed that Exxon has announced its 10th discovery offshore Guyana and increased its estimate of discovered recoverable resource for the Stabroek Block to more than 5bn oil equivalent barrels. This is sensational news for @EcoAtlantic_OG who have 15% adjacent block.

7071 2018-12-03 13:25:56 Addressing the needs and interests of PoC in rural areas is "snake oil"? Or should I say (((snake oil)))? Better to just rely on them as a voting bloc that has nowhere else to go, I suppose.

7107 2018-12-03 13:23:08 I work in the oil and gas industry.  This is not good.  Soon drilling will stop, service companies will start laying off then drilling will stop all together.  Can’t drill and explore with cheap oil.  So no, the Texas economy will suffer.

7118 2018-12-03 13:22:07 They’re apparently going to focus on LNG. Doesn’t sound good for OPEC. not really surprised, in the general sense, the USA shale shifted the power base. Oil hedge got edged out! 
7119 2018-12-03 13:21:57 This is why I'll never vote democrat again... OBAMA giving a WAR CRIMINAL A MEDAL while he praises Bush's foreign policies that have destabilized country after country over OIL AND LIES. BOTH PARTIES ARE EQUALLY WORTHLESS.

7126 2018-12-03 13:21:33 Thing is OPEC formed as a reaction to counter oil price controls that were already being done by the likes of traditional producers like the USA. Those countries economies rely on oil so OPEC makes sense to protect their interests. It worked for a while until...

7148 2018-12-03 13:19:43 I am looking for a company that can offer me a chance to join their supplier programme for 2019 especially in the mine or oil industry my email address is maropengtshikororo@gmail.com 

Please rt for awareness
7149 2018-12-03 13:19:43 And the oil that lasted 8 days came from a Palestinian grease shop 
7150 2018-12-03 13:19:30 Qatar has not much contribution producing oil, they produce Gas which has no attachment with Opec.. main players are Saudi Arabia & Russia

7156 2018-12-03 13:18:54 Oil still goes to the coast. We still have pipelines, old ones.
7157 2018-12-03 13:18:50 OIL is in scheme of NO VEIL because : 
A global scheme will definatelly OCCUR
A global problem may will constitute 3 things 
Such as:
Competing without Safety
Broke without surplus
Getting before Market surge
Open without a close proper.
Which the last didn't happen yet.
7158 2018-12-03 13:18:50 My dad took my truck for an oil change & topped my gas off while I was gone! He’s the real MVP 
7159 2018-12-03 13:18:45 Also, snake oil sellers like Gwyneth Paltrow make extraordinary claims - it's up to them to provide the extraordinary evidence to support their claims. Are you seriously suggesting that someone who recommends putting a wasp nest inside your vagina does not deserve ridicule?? ;)

7166 2018-12-03 13:18:10 Qatar is the 1st but definitely not the last.  Wondering who will follow.  The real competition of oil production will begin in no time, leading to the collapse of crude prices.  but,  then what?
7167 2018-12-03 13:18:07 Man. This guy is some kinda lower case Chavez character from what I am seeing.

7173 2018-12-03 13:17:39 think its more geopolitical, they said they wanted to focus on LNG, which makes sense they are the largest producer of LNG, and a very small oil producer (600K bpd), Colombia produces around the same amount of oil

7277 2018-12-03 13:10:26 Qatar said on Monday it was quitting #OPEC by January to focus on its gas ambitions, taking a swipe at the group’s de facto leader Saudi Arabia and marring efforts to show unity before this week’s meeting of exporters to tackle an oil price slide.

7323 2018-12-03 13:06:05 If for technical reasons we are unable to remove all palm oil from current products we pledge this small provision will be RSPO segregated standard by end 2020. We hope this answers your question! Thanks, Imogen, Dr. Oetker Baking Team

7326 2018-12-03 13:05:58 Use of palm oil is constantly under review and is only used where a suitable alternative hasn’t been found to achieve a product that performs in exactly the same way.

7399 2018-12-03 13:00:08 A guy like jancovici is doing a good analyse of this carbon problem. He's  saying,  we need to put strong effort in places where it worth doing it. House heating is the best . If you organise it properly,  you can insulate a house and replace oil heating whith heating pump.
7400 2018-12-03 13:00:06 That’s good for the market, now Qatar will head to black market to sell its oil.
7401 2018-12-03 13:00:05 VZ has no food, no medicine, no jobs. Used to be big on oil but not even enough to pay back debts. Socialist Dictator imprisons anyone that speaks against him. He rigs elections. Kills those who try to overthrow him. Babies die from no milk, malnutrition of mathers.
7402 2018-12-03 13:00:04 Lol, just how the free market oil companies are asking governments for money to build sea walls.
7403 2018-12-03 13:00:01 You see they could be run on solar or wind or even water.  There will always be a use for oil.  plastic is made of oil.  that doesn't mean we have to use it for power plants or coal.  wis fishing rules  don't eat the fish, mercury contaminated.  acid rain from coal.
7404 2018-12-03 12:59:49 Kinda like a rubber band? All them jobs lost when oil production got halted in 2015 finally started back up again?
7405 2018-12-03 12:59:47 One of his ideas - and it sounds crazy-not-crazy - is that we should be making as much plastic crap as possible and burying it in landfills, as that’s a more environmentally friendly use of the oil.

7410 2018-12-03 12:59:22 Tesla is noted for its electric cars but the most significant development may be in energy storage.  This will impact electric energy producers, oil producers and coal producers. Storing renewable energy has been the missing link.

7414 2018-12-03 12:58:57 C’est un conseil. Mueller est une raclure. Ces articles, souvent commandés par des milliardaires du parti démocrate, attisent les braises anti-Trump et fomentent la division. Le Russiagate est une fabrication politique. Il suffit pour s’en convaincre de lire la page Wikipedia
7415 2018-12-03 12:58:54 Qatar set to leave OPEC in january as Middle East spat worsens.
Qatar will quit OPEC on January 1 after 57 years of membership. Qatar is OPEC’s 11th largest oil member by production. #Qatar #oilandgas #OPEC #crudeoil #MiddleEast #TradeWars #Oilers #crudeoil #economic #economy

Oil prices rallied on Monday after the US and China agreed to temporarily stop additional trade tariffs at a G20 meeting during the weekend. Meanwhile, Qatar announced on Monday it will quit OPEC from next year
7419 2018-12-03 12:58:22 Africa is 60 times bigger than Australia, so what makes you think that we need you, you just need stop working dirty oil companies and start to work things that makes reduce Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. No you want explore other people@natural resources
7420 2018-12-03 12:58:11 So in your opinion, you can go in oil base undercoat,gloss after quick wash..and the door will not look like a cat's back 
7421 2018-12-03 12:58:09 In a next stage of the movement vegans will choose vegan companies over just "plant based" products as the whole supply chain will be important on choosing a product. That is already happening with boycott to palm oil.
7422 2018-12-03 12:58:01 If for technical reasons we are unable to remove all palm oil from current products we pledge this small provision will be RSPO segregated standard by end 2020. We hope this answers your question! Thanks, Imogen, Chicago Town Team
7423 2018-12-03 12:57:48 Use of palm oil is constantly under review and is only used where a suitable alternative hasn’t been found to achieve a product that performs in exactly the same way.
7424 2018-12-03 12:57:39 We currently use a small amount of palm oil (collectively less than 0.5% of all raw materials) in the production of our portfolio of UK products.
7425 2018-12-03 12:57:35 Govt. is always cribbing like the local moodikhanan wala bania "faido Koni", "loss hoyo" etc. etc.

7435 2018-12-03 12:56:52 I am. Scotland currently receives 8% of NS oil revenue...do you think that’s unfair? It’s Scottish oil....I believe that is wrong. There would be no supposed deficit were we to receive the extra revenue. An oil rich country forced into deficit bud...that’s where we are 
7436 2018-12-03 12:56:50 this natural oil is multipurpose...u can use for cooking or eat without cooking,use it for massage,even for hair(mainly in case of hair loss issue)

7459 2018-12-03 12:54:23 But yet, oil companies rule the world.  Place a ban on all gasoline powered cars, force industry to only produce electric powered vehicles.  But sadly no, as there is to much money to be had.  So what do they do, implement taxes which will solve nothing.

7464 2018-12-03 12:53:06 What’s inhumane is that we have to rely on countries that commit atrocities for our oil because people like u don’t want to drill the oil that we have right here in the United States

7466 2018-12-03 12:52:49 Depends on how you feel with savory vs. sweet latke toppings. Duck fat served with applesauce, any neutral oil (canola, peanut, but not olive) served with a dairy topping.

7468 2018-12-03 12:52:34 Cuticle oil and a nail nourisher from Sally Hanson or something. Also majorly depends how you took them off. If you chipped at them, it would have taken off layers of the nail. Also, give them a break for a week or two.
7469 2018-12-03 12:52:32 Starting to wonder if the intent of xrp yt’s are just hype men for clicks!! False hope is what they sell like snake oil! Buy and hodl, simple!
7470 2018-12-03 12:52:28 I enter a buy for Oil, let's see.
7471 2018-12-03 12:52:26 Peak oil! 2002-2005.
Fracking doubles production & halves the price 2006-2018
7472 2018-12-03 12:52:20 (appropriately for the holiday, this menorah is only soluble in oil)
7473 2018-12-03 12:52:18 Haha not if you eat it as much a I do 

But yeah slice lightly oil, salt and roast for 20- 30 to get it tender. It's good stuff.
7474 2018-12-03 12:52:14 This oil cutback will really get Trudeau’s attention.  Boy he’ll sure.....wait he said he WANTS the oil patch phased out!  Holy shit so this is exactly what he wanted?   What a fucking country.  This is surreal.
7475 2018-12-03 12:52:01 Quite interesting. The issue - will they continue to supply oil at the same rate? or not at all? If they increase supply, will Opec decrease to tighten the market? Without this fact, it is hard to tell but we can theorize which is what I intend doing later.
7476 2018-12-03 12:52:00 Oil's not going to fall to $10 because of politics. It will be all about a big drop in demand because of a global bust. No one wants oil to fall to $10. Won't get there in straight line & won't see it until later in 2019 but I think that's where oil likely bottoms out in the bust
7477 2018-12-03 12:51:57 OIL BUY 50.39
7478 2018-12-03 12:51:57 閉店ガラガラ！！ワオ～w(ﾟoﾟ)w
7479 2018-12-03 12:51:46 Yes, you're right. We have to remain positive. Not just through our words, but in our day to day deeds; moreso now than ever before. No one else can change this but us. You, me & the millions whom think as we do. Who yearn for human decency & not because of crude oil prices.

7485 2018-12-03 12:51:10 LOVE the coincidental graph in the background entitled "how quickly oil is diminishing".
7486 2018-12-03 12:51:07 I hope they will be a day that I will hear that an  Hausa fulanis who are the helmet of one Nigeria should try on this kind of Good news and medical practices..  than only bring us terrorism and sharing oil and gas and hearsmens alone... one Nigeria my foot...
7487 2018-12-03 12:51:05 The "gilet jaunes" are a bunch of angry Jeremy de Clarksons demanding the right to keep burning cheap oil and screw the planet. Right?

Am I missing something?
7488 2018-12-03 12:50:51 you’re supposed to mix it with something else maybe castor oil or olive oil

7491 2018-12-03 12:50:36 #ES_F Few hours ago the theme was futures up big, dollar down big, oil soaring, gold up.

Futures still up big, but dollar not doing badly. Oil up a couple bucks but a dollar off its high. Gold up less than 8.

Bonds not down as much as they "should" be, by a long shot.

7493 2018-12-03 12:50:27 Venezuela will gladly fill the heavy oil demand of US Gulf Coast as Alberta restricts production, they need the money.

7512 2018-12-03 12:48:53 Michael Gove says of the WA “it’s not perfect but it gives us the ability in the future to diverge IF WE WANT TO”.  What a snake oil salesman!!!  What appears to be a treacherous sellout by May who negotiated on behalf of EU
7513 2018-12-03 12:48:42 He doesn't care. It's all about the money to him you now he has interest in oil, gas, fossil fuel is his back up look at all the roll backs on environmental issues
7514 2018-12-03 12:48:36 I’m not talking crap my friend? We currently get 8% of NS oil revenue...that’s extremely unfair...don’t you agree that it’s unfair? I mean...it’s OUR oil after all JT. Go on...admit it! Go on go on go on go on go on etc

Me I am here wondering why these oil thieves and the political thieves normally wait till December to start their madness, then suffer us.


7521 2018-12-03 12:47:40 20-odd years ago I remember hearing an environmentalist lecture where he said that humans have never willingly not exploited a natural resource, so we have to assume all the oil will be extracted and burnt and work out how to survive that, not prevent it.

7526 2018-12-03 12:47:30 They produce principally natural gas so why they are they In OPEC  in the first place . Natural gas is priced at a discount or oil in any case.

7543 2018-12-03 12:46:25 Really grateful my job isn't in jeopardy with the way the market is going. I'm not going to advocate for oil production because it is detrimental to the environment but you can't neglect such a huge economic sector for the country without a backup plan.

7546 2018-12-03 12:46:15 And he’s letting oil and gas companies to explode charges under water to find deposits while it deafens and kills Maine mammals.  He’s an evil fuck he is. I’d like to sell him and his whole admin for parts.

7555 2018-12-03 12:45:28 I like how when I make a pot of coffee the top of the first cup poured looks like an oil spill on concrete.

7557 2018-12-03 12:45:17 I live in TN, sorry,  But, if you can get some weed, you can make oil with a crockpot.  Youtube has instructional videos.  Good luck buddy
7558 2018-12-03 12:45:14 Qatar leaving OPEC (first Gulf producer to leave since 1960) is major negative for oil in long run as it creates a competitor and weakens cartel’s authority to control crude price.
7559 2018-12-03 12:45:14 The price of oil is dropping like a rock in the USA. If you want to save some money you should drive across the border and fill up.
7560 2018-12-03 12:45:12 Wow boleh beli cleansing oil dia ni
7561 2018-12-03 12:44:55 That’s why the religion is been around for centuries and nothing happened but soon as greed for oil, gold and natural resources was wanted the religion become a problem. It’s politics mate go educate yourself

7587 2018-12-03 12:43:23 The disparity of the oil prices $58 for OPEC and $62 for Brent Crude tells me that the dirty hands of Trump is at work in this.He is making the White Nations have their oil prices go up whereas the OPEC Oil Prices were made to go down. @togunjobiTVC @tvcnewsng

7593 2018-12-03 12:42:03 Seems like pure crude oil.
7594 2018-12-03 12:41:55 Oil has little to do with it.  They're more concerned with the loss of their nation. The French middle-class is being squeezed out many ways
7595 2018-12-03 12:41:55 "Facebook is using billboards to demonstrate their commitment to fighting fake news. Uber is running TV spots to illustrate the company’s commitment...

We’re followers of Christ not followers of OIL
7644 2018-12-03 12:38:27 The world price of oil drops because the US has a leader and the powers that be in France want to raise gas and diesel taxes. They can’t afford the free stuff any longer. The US has liberal politicians trying the same.

7647 2018-12-03 12:37:59 It's a tough situation for us in Canada, largely because the federal government is unable/unwilling to make provinces work together to resolve the situation. BC profits from positive economic fallout from neighbor Alberta but does not want any oil transiting through its territory
7648 2018-12-03 12:37:57 Nakaupo na kmi and para akong bata na nagtatampo dahil wala nga kasing chicken oil. So asked again ung isang service crew kung bakit walang chicken oil, sabi nya shortage daw talaga sila. Tas nagbiro nalang ako, sabi ko "bakit naubusan ng oil ang manok dito sa gapo,

7655 2018-12-03 12:37:08 Obama wasn’t the one who lifted all of the regulations so how could he be responsible for the spike in oil?
7656 2018-12-03 12:37:02 For sure oil will be volatile...But OPEC has pretty much said it loud and clear that they will cut production with only the size and details to be worked out. Obviously the markets may take weeks to react to this but they are in the process of trying to balance things.

7664 2018-12-03 12:36:06 So eto nga,I was very upset kasi daw wala silang chicken oil  tinanong ko pa kung sa kanilang branch ba nila meron? Wala daw sa lahat ng branch ng gapo. Then ung bebe ko isa ding pang asar, sabi nya "chicken oil lang po talaga sinadya nya dito eh" 
7665 2018-12-03 12:35:50 About what?  I forgot that Clipper was built (takes oil to the US) and keystone was stalled by the former US. government. I know Energy East and Gateway slowed right down under Harper. But he wanted oil to the US
7666 2018-12-03 12:35:49 New Oil Dealsは福岡のヒップホップバンドらしい。EP2曲目”Blue Mint”のフロウはTOKYO HELTH CLUBやEnjoy Music Clubみたいな感じですごく好み。HYのAM11:00から”エンジン テンション 車のステレオ 全てのコンディション 文句なし 体揺らし”を引用した歌詞も面白い。
7667 2018-12-03 12:35:41 And then we have mining and oil companies that are terrible polluters.  The coal fired energy plants that put out .mercury that eventually falls into the water and poisons the fish, making them to toxic to eat. Obama started reigning them in but Trump is letting them do anything.

7678 2018-12-03 12:35:00 Lithium is not even comparable to oil.  There are so many potential replacements for it and there are only a few for oil
7679 2018-12-03 12:34:46 The U.S. will supply almost 20% of the world's oil, biofuels and natural gas liquids by the end of next year, up from 15% at the end of 2016, the EIA estimated. If OPEC and its allies do cut crude supplies and boost prices, U.S. market share is likely to rise even faster.

At end of 2017: Total world proven oil reserves was 1483 billion barrels & total proven oil reserves in Member Countries was 1,214 bn b

7720 2018-12-03 12:31:12 In front of big changes and big chances, companies need to simplify the question "what business are we in". Oil industry is under "energy solutions", paper industry under "information technology". You can use you earnings to build the future, not to stay in the past.

7744 2018-12-03 12:29:09 And we won't be dependent on oil forever, either. But here we are.
7745 2018-12-03 12:28:55 OPEC heavy weights Saudi etc have always tried to pressure Qatar to keep oil based pricing for Qatar LNG. QP needs LNG pricing flexibility. Gasprom has declared going to competitive pricing approach to defend gas market share.

7773 2018-12-03 12:26:18 Yes there are many hard working men and women in these camps. But being a hard worker doesn't equate to being a good person. Just Google sex trafficking and oil camps  or drugs and oil camps. Think small towns have enough cops to handle that?

7811 2018-12-03 12:22:31 So when political posturing takes precedence  over things like veterans affairs, crisis in oil and gas, sewage in rivers, clean water for our citizens, and that's where you decide to spend our money, then you sirs are crooks. Simple.
7812 2018-12-03 12:22:16 Maybe her husband is this wonderful man that she speaks of but to claim they are all such is utter foolishness. I worked in oil patch camps. There are far too many bad apples. That's why I went to school and got out. The drugs is way out of control. Some on my crew had warrants

7814 2018-12-03 12:22:05 また楽しみにしてますね(๑˃̵ᴗ˂̵)
7815 2018-12-03 12:21:48 Well, oil prices is gonna go up bcoz of #iran deal and now this. @realDonaldTrump is making a lot of noise and we will pay the price.
7816 2018-12-03 12:21:45 @QueensferryPS Daniel was in Tesco and he asked me to check the packaging of chocolate spread we would normally buy, to check for palm oil as the rainforests are being demolished and animals dying to produce it. It did so he didn't want it. Learnt in class P4W/B. Very ethical.
7817 2018-12-03 12:21:39 I expect oil cut to be between 1 to 1.4 million bpd or the two numbers that have been floated over the last month by SA and others.
7818 2018-12-03 12:21:21 someone explain to me why are there bath oils when oil doesn't mix with water, am I too dumb??
7819 2018-12-03 12:21:17 Although a staunch remainer, I used to think that Brexit had some merits as it was supported by articulate and intelligent @DanielJHannan. Then I followed him on twitter and realised that he's just another snake oil salesman.

7824 2018-12-03 12:20:37 I & my sons owe much to Charles Poliquin sport strength training of the 90’s. His death is a loss. Yet it is also a warning. Excess & authoritative lecturing on everything in life combined w bizarre med claims & snake oil sales. We are all frail & prone to believing our own hype.
7825 2018-12-03 12:20:36 Time for that first oil change?
7826 2018-12-03 12:20:30 We have been screwed by oil and gas company's for years. Profits going to private investors for sitting on their arses doing nothing for money. That moneys gone in dividends payed out... we shouldn't defend this set up any longer...
7827 2018-12-03 12:20:19 City is literally built on oil money and the club is maximum 9 yrs old or at least being supposedly relevant.
7828 2018-12-03 12:20:07 President Dilma's office was bugged during Obama's turn. The back-channel deals between oil companies and our rightists were also around Obama.Some people here are always eager to call Democrats "leftists", in a sense of the word we, Brazilians, understand of what left really is.
7829 2018-12-03 12:20:03 il n'est pas le seul, j'ai pas vu un seul LREM ou un seul Modem qui ait compris. Ils croient vraiment que baisser le gaz oil va suffire. Mais on n'est plus le 16 novembre !
7830 2018-12-03 12:19:58 Oil money 
7831 2018-12-03 12:19:50 Oil prices are currently up a tad less than 4% but the main event is still to take place... OPEC meet on Dec 6. Seems there will be a cut but major question HOW MUCH and will it be enough to chase the bears out of the market.
7832 2018-12-03 12:19:41 Their oil output is  negligible
7833 2018-12-03 12:19:32 I work in the oil and gas industry so 
7834 2018-12-03 12:19:23 We only discuss the oil because we were in the diaspora and didn't want to seem threatening to our host nations as a people who would rise up like the Maccabees did.  It was a political war for jewish self determination,  which is zionism.

7855 2018-12-03 12:17:32 But this is a diversion technique he made us all surrender our  domestic gas subsidy and triple the cost from 400-1200₹ so he cries earlier and we aren’t reminded of our loss Noteworthy is crude oil is in a historic low below 50$ entire Modi tenure 50-75$ cong tenure 100-150$

7867 2018-12-03 12:15:41 The protests were about the price of fuel. The price is too high!

The Brexit, Trump axis, that Poland, Hungary Estonia and the Czech Republic are part of, is, whether they realise it or not, also about the price oil. But this time, the price is too low!

7875 2018-12-03 12:14:56 @MontyBojangles Hi. Is the palm oil used in your chocolates sustainable? I cannot find any mention of it on the website.
7876 2018-12-03 12:14:40 There are two variables for frying, basically: saturation and chain length. So coconut oil for repeated frying is problematic because it's short -chain saturated fats.

Canola isn't the worst, and GMO high-oleic is not bad.
7877 2018-12-03 12:14:37 Worse than that, we started subsidizing them.
7878 2018-12-03 12:14:34 It’s safe to say palm oil is underrated
7879 2018-12-03 12:14:32 It’s a really bad time for this. We’re cutting oil production in an attempt to help stabilize the economy on the backs of a lot of unemployed blue collar types. Man. $50mil would pay for a lot of Christmases that aren’t going to happen.
7880 2018-12-03 12:14:21 The OECD economies are in a depression caused by high oil prices and net energy (EROEI) declining..This is why fascism is back..History always repeats..
7881 2018-12-03 12:14:18 Η Motor Oil διαπραγματεύεται στα 20,40 ευρώ με άνοδο +0,74% και κεφαλαιοποίηση 2,26 δισ. ευρώ.
7882 2018-12-03 12:14:18 Scientifically, we will have to make a change, the oil wont last forever... I like to pay less obviously, but you aren't considering the hidden cost. the sooner we start transitioning, the less pain we will have later.

Yeah, forgive me if I don't shudder with fear in the face of "Proud Boys."

7979 2018-12-03 12:02:12 @ikalin1 Qatar said on Monday it was quitting OPEC from January to focus on its gas ambitions, taking a swipe at the group's de facto leader Saudi Arabia and marring efforts to show unity before this week's meeting of exporters to tackle an oil price slide.

It is actually a kind of nature product because the particles of oil have their origin in plants, which again consisted of particles of our sun.

8197 2018-12-03 11:35:37 if anything, I stick to the 2-6 range since 2-3 does steaming and simmering quite well, and 6 will fry your meats given they have fat or you add a little spray (just remember to drain the fat).  7 can sear, and if you use cooking oil, it prefers high heats (and is tricky)

in that the woods family owns a share in the fishing quota.
Did you also point out to him that in 2014 in said that the oil 
would run out in 15 years despite knowledge of the Claire discovery at that time.
8224 2018-12-03 11:32:23 Lol yeah I get it but the problem is the producer engages in rent-seeking behaviour( ie cartels like OPEC), the price of oil is artificial, the market will never last operating that way as seen by the USA already ramping up production and alternatives making headway in costs.

8229 2018-12-03 11:32:05 RT KellyGilblom: Shell has taken a big step on climate change, saying it will set concrete, short-term emissions targets. Big Oil shareholders who want companies to do more on climate will only get bolder from here. BP_plc exxonmobil Chevron are clearly in their sights #OOTT…
8230 2018-12-03 11:32:02 CNN are completely factually wrong. Oil prices are the lowest in over a year. What ever happened to independent news.
8231 2018-12-03 11:31:57 My car has a DV6 engine 1.6 diesel, I run her on a 50% mix veg oil/ diesel which works out at £1 oil £1.34 diesel = £1.17 a liter ($5.64 a US gallon). I thought diesel was cheaper to produce than petrol?

8234 2018-12-03 11:31:45 Absolute power corrupts absolutely.  Harper was too much of a US puppet sold our oil for dirt cheap, tried to legislate law changes into constitution. He had to go so he was voted out by those who showed in droves. Jack Layton could have won had he still been alive change needed

8236 2018-12-03 11:31:34 What is your view on long-term oil prices?
8237 2018-12-03 11:31:32 I know we are not expecting some garlic, herbs, olive oil and all the nice things that happen in the kitchen and turn the house into some great catalyst for appetite in the bathrooms. But haykhona!
8238 2018-12-03 11:31:18 I need a oil change badlyyyy 
8239 2018-12-03 11:31:06 Terrible. Caving to investor activists. Tell them to FOff because we all know oil is here to stay...for as long as possible.

Take investments to renewables and see where it gets you...

8248 2018-12-03 11:30:03 The powers that be pulled out all the stops AT ONE synchronized event last weeks. From intervening in oil markets to FED - If Trump didn’t have G20 Xi plan #ES_F would already be testing\breaking 2600 - but that will happen soon enough

8250 2018-12-03 11:29:57 The front of my notebooks are full of oil jusko ang dugyot ko
8251 2018-12-03 11:29:55 It’s all about the $ unfortunately. Unstable oil countries are easier to exploit. America = Imperial power. America is no longer a democracy but a oiligarchy.
8252 2018-12-03 11:29:53 Oil+ filter= glow

8253 2018-12-03 11:29:47 Olive oil makes great lube FYI
8254 2018-12-03 11:29:41 The Trump administration announced Friday that it approved requests from five companies to survey for oil and gas under the floor of the Atlantic Ocean using a process some scientists have warned is disastrous for marine life. From Huffington Post.
8255 2018-12-03 11:29:41 A fraud from day one. Hockey stick my ass. 

You’re right, just follow the money.
8256 2018-12-03 11:29:37 OIL.  The US is already awash in oil & gas thanks to fracking, but I guess the greedy oil companies think we aren't destroying the world fast enough for their profits, so they want even MORE - and are willing to kill a few million dolphins & whales to get it. 
8257 2018-12-03 11:29:32 Excellent. Well done. I expect nothing less from @NewsOK than full throated support of Big Oil regardless of the consequences.
8258 2018-12-03 11:29:22 Harper mismanaged oil for ideological reasons. Never built a refinery. Now Alberta suffers...
8259 2018-12-03 11:29:20 I'm out because 'blockchain' is snake oil and having studied both citizen science and crowdfunding (and incentives for both) extensively as a Phd researcher and postdoc I am extremely skeptical about this approach.
8260 2018-12-03 11:29:17 Nak jer aku buat kiraan sendiri berapa kerajaan bagi subsidy/kutip duit dari oil companies setiap bulan via penetapan harga minyak petrol/diesel/LPG.

Cuma aku belum join pembangkang.. Lol.
8261 2018-12-03 11:29:09 les gendarmes qui se payent le gaz oil pour leur voitures de patrouilles, etc...et pendant ce temps là on change la vaisselle , on refait la décoration....
8262 2018-12-03 11:28:53 OPEC is a relic of a thought well past our new energy markets. Most any action it takes harms it’s members. You can thank the American oil industry for this dynamic.

8267 2018-12-03 11:28:29 Too much vodka I guess 
8268 2018-12-03 11:28:28 frying bacon I still don't know how to do!  it's especially tricky because oil continues to cook bacon as you turn off the heat.... but most basic meats are really easy to panfry/bake

unless you need to achieve a rolling boil putting a stove above 7 is probably unnecessary...
8269 2018-12-03 11:28:20 4. Thanks to its oil, rubbing the inside of a banana peel on a  mosquito bite (or other bug bite) or on poison ivy will help keep it  from itching and getting inflamed.
8270 2018-12-03 11:28:08 Hmm does it mean more Oil price hikes? Sorry don't understand the role of OPEC
8271 2018-12-03 11:28:03 Gift ideas for Christmas.. gorgeous skin care range available in store. Our Rosa Mosqueta range is pure luxury and if you purchase an oil you get a free jade skin roller

8273 2018-12-03 11:27:59 Qatar is leaving OPEC next month and they are increasing production. How much oil do they have? Great news regardless
8274 2018-12-03 11:27:49 He said there was 10 to 15 years of oil in the North Sea? BP announced only last week 40 years of oil extraction of enough to supply Scotland's needs. Of course you could say that west of Shetland is not in the North Sea?

8280 2018-12-03 11:26:58 france is that XIX century "puissance" in decline for 200 yrs, and interwoven with their oil and market interests in multiple muslim ex colonies. a 3rd world country exerting power over the 4th world.
8281 2018-12-03 11:26:58 Did you even read the story. While Cheap oil equals lower gas prices which is good for the general consumer it also has a huge impact on ancillary industries which a few years ago had a significant impact on the GNP.
8282 2018-12-03 11:26:48 Global oil consumption alone is seven billion kilograms per day. We've been unwittingly geo-engineering our planet for over a century.
8283 2018-12-03 11:26:47 สวยดีคะ ใครว่าอย่าไปสนค่ะ
8284 2018-12-03 11:26:39 Huh? It means that oil is buying his allegiance.
8285 2018-12-03 11:26:38 Moral compass for who. Your husband spent 11 trillion dollar's. Shut down oil production kill many car dealerships started bad racial relations or made them worse. Fired up criminals against police. Moral cumpass of a snake. Chicago style.
8286 2018-12-03 11:26:27 Because we don't own the oil. We didn't discover it. What we get is not what you think
8287 2018-12-03 11:26:18 What does the middle east have to do with Russian aggression in Europe? At least we know that Russian oligarchs  profit from Syrian oil. That makes sense. But why create an eternal enemy out of Ukraine? It makes no sense.

8300 2018-12-03 11:24:56 This money is tired to agenda 2030 , and Canada is in crisis. Alberta oil is being given away and Ontario's manufacturing heart is being dismantled and @JustinTrudeau  somehow thinks wasting more of Canada's money is somehow a good thing. 
It's not.

8327 2018-12-03 11:20:15 In the contrary, Qatar is capable of producing more than 600K this was the quota given by OPEC. If this move was inaffective oil prices would have not reacted the way it did with an increase of 5%. The political crisis has nothing to do with this.

8369 2018-12-03 11:15:16 By my reckoning. Westminster owes Scotland 700 billion pounds in oil revenues over the years. Maybe even more
8370 2018-12-03 11:15:10 Yeah,
It's probably just a massive coincidence that the two administrations run by the familial owners of Arbusto Oil (Bush Oil) and it's successors invaded the worlds largest oil field.

8374 2018-12-03 11:14:39 Not good for me as a petroleum engineer lol. Lower oil price as evidenced in 2014 means less exploration and in turn less jobs and more lay-offs. Good for the consumer, bad for the producer.

8383 2018-12-03 11:13:44 Sir, what about russia and saudi confirmed that there are no additional cuts over and above the OPEC+agreement. How will this affect the oil with combining the reasons mentioned by you? Please correct me if I said something wrong.

8503 2018-12-03 11:01:57 #Qatar leaving #OPEC  could see Oil essentially rise for couple of weeks because that would give other #OPEC members more control over decision making. Let's not forget Qatar has one if the biggest #oilreserves

8513 2018-12-03 11:00:10 Happened during Obama administration. This is what caused the slide in oil prices a few years back. Around the time Modi came to power.
8514 2018-12-03 11:00:04 The 2016 recession is the icing on the cake compared to what will happen if we can't find a solution to our reliance on Crude Oil.
We need a government that can diversify this economy and make it one of the best if not the best in Africa.

8528 2018-12-03 10:57:56 I didn’t read it that way at all. Just that IT contractors are getting the attention (mainly because the governments line is that they are the main targets), but many other professions are also impacted. I hear that a lot of Oil&Gas workers are facing the Loan Charge.

8532 2018-12-03 10:57:38 BREAKING NEWS:Qatar pulls out of OPEC to focus on gas production. Nigeria has no business in OPEC. This oil cartel favors members with most oil reserves than population. Nigeria with 200 million citizens needs more than 2 million barrels a day allocated to her by OPEC.
8533 2018-12-03 10:57:36 Haha classic "it's clearly all about the oil"
8534 2018-12-03 10:57:32 Pakistan does well to stay aloof & away from the Battle of Egos among rich Arab Oil States. They've achieved a "state"(a helpless condition since they can't help themselves) where rubbing shoulders among rivals causes sparks to fly, sometime accompanied by fumes & fire.
8535 2018-12-03 10:57:30 I don’t think of it as a swipe Qatar produces more natural gas and doesn’t depend much on oil. 600k bpd of oil production won’t sway the market prices. If this was a swipe it would of have happened 18months ago when the crisis happened
8536 2018-12-03 10:57:17 Hi Issac, thank you for sending this pic over. Our teams are working on this at the moment along with the EA to try and get the oil under control and have removed the source of the issue. Hopefully we should see a difference soon - Amy

8561 2018-12-03 10:55:02 You shouldn't rely on using oil as your primary production consumable at all. Also, there are better options to drill oil than ripping apart another natural habitat. As long as your gasoline prices are low right? Lets just blow up the whole world while were at it then..

8582 2018-12-03 10:51:31 In commodities, oil prices jumped, as a trade ceasefire between the U.S. and China sparked demand for riskier assets.

8632 2018-12-03 10:44:50 Pretty shit to hear this. So long as we invest more than every other team in Europe, barring those funded by oil, I don't really care. We outspend real Madrid, and Chelsea that is the reality. If when that changes then moan

8637 2018-12-03 10:43:30 we should probably start seriously investing in alternate energy sources! instead of enriching any more oil execs and ravaging the fucking planet
8638 2018-12-03 10:43:29 As chris said, ETH is the "oil" upon which this economy depends. It appears inflation will be limited and there are numerous mechanisms by which holding is incentivized within the mechanics of the system. And in a digital world, what's difference between oil and gold for money?

* Saudi/Russia and OPEC+ signal production restraint

8751 2018-12-03 10:28:11 Contributions from employees of oil/gas companies (of which there are many in Texas) count towards this total. The figure doesn’t mean much and certainly not the easy conclusion Sirota is implying.
8752 2018-12-03 10:27:58 Using coal for making jewellery and cosmetics wouldn't be a problem. Just like oil  would be much less a problem if we would use it only as a resource to make chemicals (still, the plastic problem would remain).

8766 2018-12-03 10:25:54 Aside from crude oil, people often forget that Qatar has a self imposed moratorium on additional LNG output. If it wanted to, it could easily surpass Australia, US, etc on LNG exports

8834 2018-12-03 10:17:25 I showed you.

Scotland currently gets, in GERS, full allocation of the revenue from oil. Revenue isn't Scotland's biggest issue, our needed high public spending is.

Indy decimates that, and our over dependance on oil REVENUE (not GDP) is unaddressed by Indy supporters.
8835 2018-12-03 10:17:08 Isn’t this the same “Scots ty-Goon Sir Ian Wood” who told YOU lies about North Sea oil running out back in 2014? It is the very same isn’t it! I would suggest you be sceptical of what he says due the lies he has told to you previously.

8838 2018-12-03 10:17:01 Qatar is more of a gas producer. Their oil production has been steadily declining. More importantly this goes to show OPEC is a spent force

8841 2018-12-03 10:16:38 Getting Canada out of our pockets instantly puts ~$20 billion in Alberta's, even in this shitty oil market. Say all the services Canada provides that we'd have to replace cost $10bn/yr (they don't). At current spending levels on everything else we'd still have a $2 bn surplus.

8896 2018-12-03 10:09:58 Qatar leaves OPEC after 58 years, which will be the impact on oil prices? Impact on geopolitics? Is Trump happy .. "Divide et impera"?
8897 2018-12-03 10:09:54 If you think the equator is the hottest place to be, try to stay with a person who breathes hot oil when displeased.
8898 2018-12-03 10:09:26 Don’t think running 900 more rail cars up and down our aging rail line is the best idea yet. All for pipeline and moving the the oil but first train disaster where lives are lost or environmental damage might come back and kick us in the ass. But it employs workers.
8899 2018-12-03 10:09:23 #Qatar has decided to leave the #OPEC and announces to increase its natural gas production to 110 millions a year. Me: Good strategic move because the oil body is dominated by #SaudiArabia
8900 2018-12-03 10:09:23 The poor have always eaten many carbs because they are cheap.   So it must be something else, like how the carbs are processed, or veg oil, or stopping eating natural fats (lard is cheap and used to be used on toast).
8901 2018-12-03 10:09:19 Indeed.  Compared to Stavanger & Bergen in Norway and of course Houston in the USA we have done pretty badly out of oil and gas.
8902 2018-12-03 10:09:15 It's party trick was gearbox oil coming up the speedo cable and leaking on the clock's and on to the pedals!
8903 2018-12-03 10:08:46 That won't be of a great impact since Qatar is not a big Oil producer. They are the world's largest liquefied gas producer, but not oil.
8904 2018-12-03 10:08:24 What might work even better to secure our homes and security would be NOT occupying people's countries or inciting violence in THEIR homes to begin with. Often this happens with capitalist aims and comes with stupidity like oil wars or the propping up of tyrannical governments.

8927 2018-12-03 10:04:16 Hard to believe that the UK is a decades-long oil and gas producing nation - it has never = below 50% road fuel taxes, let alone the pennies of some nations. (And the EU ruled the 5% heating fuel VAT).
US citizens go onto the streets with guns, French etc riot - we have tutting
8928 2018-12-03 10:04:12 The last Time I called him was in Jan 2012... We talked extensively bout the protest @ ojota concerning the oil subsidy removal and ever since then... .
8929 2018-12-03 10:04:06 Why are the gas prices in France going up while the price of oil is going down globally?
8930 2018-12-03 10:03:59 If course, we should trust someone who openly lied about the oil industry or was he just so wrong in his predictions?
Either way you look at it, we can simply ignore his advice as he has obviously been promised Tories will fight for 1% of Scotland’s business for their support!

8953 2018-12-03 10:01:21 How will Nigerians feed when only one man can loot 2b USD. Not to talk of petroleum minister or army chief. How much was oil price back then and how much is oil price now.  Rome was not built in a day so we must suffer before we smile again.
8954 2018-12-03 10:01:05 Yes I'm in favor of this protest, w need around the world the same!  Fight against this corrupt system, the government makes more than 80% revenue on oil. Working people pay more 38% in  taxes & more HRS of work, increase time for retirement at  the end you get nothing just F"k!
8955 2018-12-03 10:01:01 Recent news suggests oil production will be cut.

Saudis seek alliance with Russia, Mexico, Azerbaijan and Kazahkstan.

Canada also appears to be cutting back.

So.......

Pressure points on the Naira reduces, just expect cylical scarcity of USD due to election spending.

Socialism. Doesn't. Work.
8969 2018-12-03 09:59:51 It's hardly all about the oil. It's about impoverishing a nation over the AGW scam, enriching the elites, high taxes, low wages and politicians living like kings and acting like they are kings. They are tired of supporting the 3rd world, culture destroying migrants Soros demanded

8973 2018-12-03 09:59:03 I don't disagree. Not at all. But it is all linked. For example, if "we" didn't have to deal with oil rich regimes there would be no reason to turn a blind eye to their abuses of human rights. As for the French public, they always get what they demand.

9168 2018-12-03 09:30:13 Will be a super week for #AAOG
9169 2018-12-03 09:30:05 This is going to be a huge day for long oil positions 

I’m going to update my portfolio composition excluding some non-trading cash positions for simplicity, will result in apparently higher portfolio leverage. Portfolio composition is the same (ex-cash “withdrawal”)
9170 2018-12-03 09:29:54 Qatar said on Monday it was quitting OPEC from January 2019 but would attend the oil exporter group's meeting this week, saying the decision meant Doha could focus on cementing its position as the world's top liquefied natural gas exporter. (Reuters)
9171 2018-12-03 09:29:53 Yet not brilliant: "Total power generation in 2017 was 270,279 GWh -- which was supplied from coal (46.6%), natural gas (34.6%), nuclear (8.3%), renewables (4.6%), oil (4.7%), and pumped-storage hydro (1.2%)."
9172 2018-12-03 09:29:20 He was 100% correct about oil, as proven by history as he said oil would be worth a fraction of what Alex Salmond promised which was 8bn of oil tax revenues 

And guess what ?

It was zero

9175 2018-12-03 09:28:45 I’m sitting in the car right now wondering if I should check the oil now or tomorrow before work I’m spending more time thinking cause it could have been done by now. Hahaha
9176 2018-12-03 09:28:23 So they slow down production because their reserves are overflowing. Oil prices are always a scam. There is so much oil in Reserves all of the world, we should be back at $1 a gallon. Greed.

They think we are all dafties
9187 2018-12-03 09:26:42 france is a fun preview of what peak oil will look like. neat stuff!

how about we stop relying on fossil fuels asap
9188 2018-12-03 09:26:41 Got it. That’s barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) which includes conversion of gas to oil (conversion ratio of 5.62 per mmscf of gas to 1 barrel of crude oil).

9191 2018-12-03 09:26:10 Middle East countries are beginning to diversify by reenvisioning into GAS & by quitting OPEC. Nigeria still solely depends on oil.
9192 2018-12-03 09:26:04 This photo looks like he's on trial for something like malpractice. He's the #vegan equivalent to a snake oil salesman, a vegetable oil salesman.
9193 2018-12-03 09:26:03 Agreed. Snake oil salesmanship might kill a few,  Snake oil scientists can kill us all.
9194 2018-12-03 09:26:03 #Qatar leaving #OPEC is a big development. First split since the organisation was created. This can cause volatility in the oil market.
9195 2018-12-03 09:25:53 Passado o ano sensacional do Palmeiras, hora do justo e merecido descanso. Mas o planejamento não pode parar. Renovações, contratos, reforços, vendas... e, só aqui entre nós... a proposta da tal Black Star Oil já chegou???
9196 2018-12-03 09:25:42 With the announcement from Qatar...we will have another Iran on our hands.

Since Iran exited the OPEC, they had unfettered access to pump oil products into the market (thanks to Obama & the useless Iran nuclear deal).

Focusing on gas is just a decoy for their real intention.

9201 2018-12-03 09:25:09 It’s astonishing, isn’t it? It’s like changing the oil on a car that sits at the bottom of the sink hole it’s fallen into, expecting that will let it continue driving along the now non-existent road.

9217 2018-12-03 09:23:34 You need fresh oil on your head ,your sense is fast diminishing.
9218 2018-12-03 09:23:10 Yeah you guys need to get out in front of this with "sex workers" nude with yellow vests and migrants looting stores in Paris. Kind of like how the left got out in front of the Iraq War and made it about oil to distract from all of the partisan Zionists in Bush's cabinet.
9219 2018-12-03 09:23:07 헤ㅐㄹ스장 가야지!
9220 2018-12-03 09:22:59 Notley didn't cause this and she did what she could to prevent it, which was very little. The differential exists because the only place we can ship oil to is, thanks to shale, the world's most saturated oil market. We've known we needed a pipeline to water for 20 years.
9221 2018-12-03 09:22:51 It's used to give the product body & flavour & has always been a part of the recipe but was previously listed as vegetable oil
9222 2018-12-03 09:22:45 More than snake oil salesmanship. The scientists are proposing tinkering about in the stratosphere with nary a clue of what the full range of unintended consequences may be. Extremely foolhardy and potentially dangerous.
9223 2018-12-03 09:22:40 Just really curious, how do u tell ur Yoruba girl friend/ mum that there is too much oil and pepper in their food?
9224 2018-12-03 09:22:36 England - Brexit 

Qatar - To exit OPEC on January 1st.

And there’s Nigeria, ignoring other potential sectors and overly dependent on oil, with no plans for the future. We’re a tragedy waiting to happen.

9253 2018-12-03 09:19:58 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
9254 2018-12-03 09:19:58 so, which country will wests control th price??, oil or gas??
9255 2018-12-03 09:19:36 tutto deriva dalla scelta di ancorare i prezzi ad un hub abbandonando il riferimento ai prezzi oil, mediati su 9 mesi. ma a gennaio ci sarà una diminuzione della componente trasporto, per cui speriamo il bilancio sia in pareggio rispetto al trimestre corrente.

#oil strong following #Russia / #SaudiArabia
9263 2018-12-03 09:19:00 I guess it highlights the fact that the market has such a high reliance on high growth areas to make up for a magnitude of declining fields that the biggest problem supply faces is the swamping of infrastructure that turns high growth areas into stranded oil pretty quickly!

Qatar to withdraw from OPEC as of January 2019, minister says

Oil production will not long remain at peak levels of 500,000 barrels (80,000 m³) per day, as oil fields are projected to be mostly depleted by 2023.
9310 2018-12-03 09:11:37 To late.Decrease should have come 1 Nov. and increase mid December as oil is trading up right now .

9315 2018-12-03 09:10:46 SNL parody aside, Putin would appear to need Trump more now & has lost some of his leverage over him post-Cohen guilty plea. Putin is dealing w/lower oil prices, a slow economy hampered by corruption & a restless populace that blames him.

If you really believe oil companies are promoting science they know is fake to encourage MORE climate action, you're just wilfully deluding yourself
9318 2018-12-03 09:10:34 Most countries have a deficit... unless they have vast oil wealth & use it wisely. So it's entirely plausible Scotland does have a deficit. I doubt it's anything like as bad as unionists say. & more importantly it's entirely under UK (mis)management, a reason FOR independence.

9337 2018-12-03 09:07:51 Quite possible that oil prices may increase.
9338 2018-12-03 09:07:49 The way fuel prices are going down it will soon discover new oil field.
9339 2018-12-03 09:07:47 Ramping up domestic oil production and simultaneously doing everything in his power to lower oil prices to appeal to his base has shown what an idiot trump is...  hes going to ensure that domestic oil production is permanently crippled because they cant recoup investments.
9340 2018-12-03 09:07:31 Hmph. In America they put things like walnut oil or vanilla in their coffee. My train to both is the same: why muck up something that's already so good?

9354 2018-12-03 09:05:24 Russia and Saudi Arabia produce most of the world oil. Little wonder there's a political drive to electric vehicles and other policies to reduce oil dependency. Selling these policies via a climate change envelope. It does untold harm to poor people.
9355 2018-12-03 09:05:08 Thats bcz they are on to S-500 now. Russia needs money & with oil looking down they don't have very many things to earn those dollars. Also, it is in their interest to keep India strong else China will start bullying them some day.

9432 2018-12-03 08:55:16 Nigeria's reliance on oil revenues for everything remains the bane of all systems as this revenue can no longer cater for our growing population. Until we have a reliable contributoryf system for financing healthcare in Nigeria, all other actions will always fail!

9440 2018-12-03 08:53:35 After spending close to a decade working in the Nigerian healthcare system. I have realised that the real problem is with the citizens that continuously think health care should be FREE OR paid 4 wit oil proceeds. It is a failed system that will always deliver mediocre services

many were complaining about 30% decrease in crude oil price and mere 12% decrease in petrol and deisel prices should explain

Why ?

9509 2018-12-03 08:44:31 You're making gospel out of a report that is forecasting growth of 2% if oil prices stay at $70. There are other reports from Transparency Int'l, etc that say where we are and not so "prophetic". If ministries have perm secs, why was PMB elected? Guy...we are worse with PMB.

9514 2018-12-03 08:43:36 I would be much happier to see additional refineries, as opposed to additional pipelines (particularly pipelines leading south, where we only get bottom dollar). Our lumber, oil, metals - anything that can be refined & sold to more lucrative markets - should be.

9571 2018-12-03 08:35:31 USA is 2 years behind the world on green power now, that is going to be a lot harder, how are we going to add a carbon tax when gas is $10 a gallon?
We need to get out of control of the oil corporations, but this will make it hard

9572 2018-12-03 08:35:11 Small arithmetic 

Qatar wants to raise its oil production from 4.8mbpd of oil to 6.5mbpd

+

Iran being allowed to sell oil

+

America increasing supply

+

Reduced demand

= Problem for all oil based economies

For Nigeria, another recession seems not so far away

9576 2018-12-03 08:34:53 A fascinating thread. Every point rebutted - even the rather odd one about the absence of North African olive oil from supermarket shelves - and in the end says, in effect,  “I was just winding you up”.

9707 2018-12-03 08:18:42 Well even with the existing eastern and western pipelines in place, nearly all of our oil goes south. Twinning the existing lines will only send even more oil south at a shitty price, if we aren't targeting non-American markets.
9708 2018-12-03 08:18:40 Green New Deal does not call for no new fossil fuel extraction or no new fossil fuel infrastructure, rather focused only on emissions for which oil & gas will expand fracking under guise of fracking; 100% reference is US power, meaning expansion of fracking for overseas export.

9750 2018-12-03 08:13:07 Great news!  OPEC for far too long has kept the price of oil far to high by manipulating production. One only hopes the Qatari reserves are strong enough to withstand any OPEC price war.

9752 2018-12-03 08:12:53 Yes, I’m thinking that he’s more of a pariah than irrelevant! Our economy and the fact that oil is changed in dollars dictates that. But nobody wants to be seen with him.

9761 2018-12-03 08:11:25 @JoeNeguse I can see why you would be on board w/this as it does not call for no new fossil fuel extraction or infrastructure and would permit expansion of fracking; especially for export overseas. Your constituents know you took oil and gas interest money you can't be on cmte.
9762 2018-12-03 08:11:21 Well there’s ditching your diesel guzzling car and air travel. That would make a difference. And not buying so much ‘stuff’. And choosing to support mixed organic farming where the use of oil based treatments is vastly reduced. And then not buying poor quality meat

9769 2018-12-03 08:10:04 But pipelines are filled to the max, and Alberta (the provincial Gov’t) is also buying rail tankers to move the oil out.
9770 2018-12-03 08:10:03 If we're producing 10.000,000 barrels of crude oil per day, at the going rate of about $50 a barrel, that comes to $182,500,000,000 a year earned by big oil.
Between 2003 and 2009 big oil paid but $15.6b tax.
The state of Texas receives only 4.6 cents tax per barrel.

This could destabilize OPEC. This seems to be a massive FU to SA and the founding nations of OPEC. 

Qatar produces a ton of liquid natural gas and claims to be turning its attention to that rather than produce oil.

9836 2018-12-03 08:01:43 .@BBCAndrewBlack amazed that you danced around his previous very damaging comments on oil and gas - should now be pretty much gone according to his BBCScotlandNews 2014 words - and workable? For whom? Not Joe Public.
9837 2018-12-03 08:01:38 Potato latke help for a complete novice. Can I 1. leave the skins on the potatoes when grating for more fibre? 2. Use coconut oil instead of schmalz to keep it vegetarian? Thanks for input
9838 2018-12-03 08:01:29 He also said oil was finished. He also got a knighthood for his "services". He's also one of the 5 millionaire fishermen.

9842 2018-12-03 08:01:06 India has no control on GLOBAL oil prices being out of control right now. ALL countries are suffering. Not just Indians.Stop DHONGRESSing n blaming the Government for everything. You're living in a country where already <5% people pay taxes. Stop demanding tax cuts on fuel.

9851 2018-12-03 08:00:22 From SLAVERY to GENOCIDE to continued GENOCIDE, the British govt and their jihadists will do anything to steal oil and gas from Hebrew Biafra. Shame to Globalist. Nigeria has expired AMALGAMATED 1914 to 2014 to steal oil. REFERENDUM.
9852 2018-12-03 08:00:10 LOL!

9863 2018-12-03 07:59:13 The same Ian Wood who said oil was running out whilst clutching a dozen fracking licences? The same one who is part of the 5 family Tory/Leaver fishing cartel? The same one who wanted to pave over Union Tce Gardens & have it renamed in his own honour? That one? He can bog off.
9864 2018-12-03 07:59:08 One of the biggest questions that scholars deal with is why the miracle of the oil is celebrated so prominently, when the miracle of Maccabees victory over the Greeks should have more significance, as it involved an existential threat to the Jewish People.
9865 2018-12-03 07:59:06 Oof. Just been scolded for chiming in on a discussion on lube for saying baby oil isn't safe.

BABY OIL IS NOT SAFE LUBE. DO NOT USE BABY OIL AS LUBE. 

(Ditto Vaseline, basic cooking oil, or butter. Just buy some goddamn lube. Or coconut oil.)

9868 2018-12-03 07:58:19 The report decided to review their rating cos of the ongoing economic recovery and DECREASING external vulnerabilities both supported by INCREASED oil production (in the country) and higher global oil prices. (Literally the first sentence in the report)
9869 2018-12-03 07:58:19 Fossil fuels.  If you didn't develop your country when the Oil money was available,  you won't be able to develop it when the Oil money dries up when they put a stop to the use of fossil fuels.  Lost opportunity indeed. This means our people will continue to be born in poverty

9871 2018-12-03 07:58:06 Blockchain is snake oil trying to fix a problem that doesn't exist, the sooner it dies the better. 10 years it's been around, if there were valid applications for this, they'd be in place now. But nothing at all.
9872 2018-12-03 07:58:02 unfortunately, crude oil rebound almost 6% today, it's not good for us drivers.

9877 2018-12-03 07:57:17 Qatar, Saudi Arabia are running out of oil and are planning for their uncomfortable time after oil. 
Qarar eg will leave the opec 2019, to stew their own soup.

Plus, they will melt away in 50 degrees if there is no more energy for ac.
So, nice juicy Europe, Canada is the option.
9878 2018-12-03 07:57:12 I would not read too much into this Qatar thing given the relative importance of their oil production. However I see this as another setback into the MBS track record to keep GCC united.

9887 2018-12-03 07:56:16 There was a bottle of oil prepared on a table near the bed for this very purpose. He picked it up, removing the stopper, and poured a generous amount between the mounds of the other's behind, coating oil over the entrance before he shoved two fingers in.

9894 2018-12-03 07:54:58 You excuse coal and spew nonsense about oil spills that haven't occurred. You use an oil based product to tweet buy want oil exploration stopped. You support Saudi oil imports over using AB oil and you are righteous about your ignorance.

9897 2018-12-03 07:54:06 Though admitting vulnerability to oil prices, they also expected the foreign reserves which had grown impressively to handle any shocks. The foreign reserves increase was a function of both increase in oil export receipts and increase in inflows of foreign investments.

9906 2018-12-03 07:53:24 He killed gateway. KXL rebirth and oil collapse killed EE, with an assist from TRP bungling NEB process. Idea that an emissions test derailed it is risible. And, it's put forward as an excuse by same people who say it's easy to prove pipes don't cause increased emissions.
9907 2018-12-03 07:53:02 And nevermind that the climate change debate hasn't been settled in the scientific community, sure most agree it has always changed, but not really on how much we actually impact it. rubbish, oil and plastic pollution which is definitely a problem we need to fix.
9908 2018-12-03 07:52:53 Nothing better after the stresses of a long hard work day than [checking cupboard] some coconut oil smeared on a dreamcatcher.
9909 2018-12-03 07:52:39 We sell at such a low price because our oil has no market access. Pipelines to the east where our refineries and shipping access are would make us competitive. Same with the west. Also we aren’t running out of the stuff anytime soon

9916 2018-12-03 07:51:59 Just curious how you felt at the Terrace hearing when you asked the NEB to not approve Northern Gateway, & how you feel now knowing your actions helped landlock OUR oil, & put us in the position we are now in. You should resign on that action alone.

9918 2018-12-03 07:51:52 Why compare Apple with orange? The population of UAE is under 10m with proven oil reserves of 97bn. Our population is about 200m with proven oil reserves of 37bn barrels. Even now, UAE is having serious economic challenges and has now introduced VAT and increased fuel prices.

9920 2018-12-03 07:51:45 Haha, proof bitumen sinks (oil is lighter than water genius) Trudeau the groper bought the pipeline & removed 20bil of private money from CDA. Your diehard excuses for the groping PM is sad and pathetic. Oil floats genius it doesn't sink. GFC learn facts before spewing BS

9924 2018-12-03 07:51:27 She had anti oil activists on the government payroll ffs.  She's only doing this because there's an election coming up. The plan for her and Trudeau was to shut down the oil sands and they've done a fine effing job of it.
9925 2018-12-03 07:51:25 RT NewellNYC: #Chanukah is a great time to advocate for the #GreenNewDeal. It is the only holiday I know of that's about energy conservation. The Maccabees cut oil consumption by 7/8ths. #AGreatMiracleHappenedThere

9926 2018-12-03 07:51:24 Oil majors may also react to higher oil prices (Russia to continue cooperating with Saudi Arabia) as well as Qatar deciding to leave OPEC from 1 Jan.
9927 2018-12-03 07:51:08 As well as its desire to focus on gas, #Qatar’s announcement that it’ll leave OPEC in Jan 2019 clearly reflects depth of its political rift with #Saudi/UAE. By further institutionalising the split, the move also further weakens already-fragmented #GCC. #oil

9931 2018-12-03 07:50:44 Well I don't pretend to understand world markets & commodity pricing, but if we aren't getting good return on our oil, & it's a non-renewable resource, then it makes sense to buy low & sell high, does it not? (ie: import when prices are down & export once prices go back up).

9941 2018-12-03 07:49:39 I'm not going to argue whatever bias or prejudice you have. The report did express concerns over debt and vulnerability to oil prices but the positives outweigh the negatives (for those that will read just comments and not the actual report). I will list a few.

9960 2018-12-03 07:46:52 Why it hurts Airlines profits if oil prices fall down ! It should be the other way around?

9965 2018-12-03 07:46:33 Yep he's the engine oil. The last couple of season of the Office were good but it just wasn't the same after Steve left. In a way he makes other characters more entertaining.

9971 2018-12-03 07:45:51 Nah, just fine the oil companies at source for decades of pollution.
Maybe kick out ANZ & a few disingenuous insurance companies.

Focus on actual value-add NZ companies.
Keep profits in-country, & taxes paid on them, too.
Y’know, some honest commerce.
9972 2018-12-03 07:45:49 Yes, the second biggest recipient of oil and gas money in Congress will pull a TON of Bernie supporters
9973 2018-12-03 07:45:34 Yes...forget to inform who built Taleeban against Russia, who built Al Qaida and so on. Just bcs of oil and power the world is in struggle and many innocents were killed. Truly said thx

9982 2018-12-03 07:44:14 No, that is incorrect. There were 2 primary miracles. the miracle of the Macabees defeating the Greeks, and the miracle of the oil burning for 8 days.

Angus ramping: SS has given a value for a Kimmeridge site with 6 wells: £100m at $70 oil. 65% of Brockham = £65m to Angs. 16p/share. Assuming it flows. Yard and a half of acreage.
9984 2018-12-03 07:44:05 @piersmorgan why you even talking to that war criminal. I was sent to war for his cronies to control oil.
9985 2018-12-03 07:44:04 #gmb the reason he went into Iraq was because saddam stopped selling oil in dollars! And so the USA was going in regardless! And as soon as they toppled the gov the sales were switched back to $$$!
9986 2018-12-03 07:44:04 Are we headed for a oil sales liberalization era?
9987 2018-12-03 07:44:03 #Qatar exit is a humble brag of its growing #LNG dominance, throwing sand at the Saudi’s at a bad time and putting its isolation back on the agenda. Just days before #Vienna - renewed questions about #OPEC relevance and control. Will others follow? #OOTT #Oil

9989 2018-12-03 07:43:56 Govt prevents any expansion to the transportation of oil out of Alberta then turns around and says it is a failure of the marketplace. Because of said failure of the marketplace they now have to cut production. You know you are insane when... #abpoli #nlpoli #canpoli

9994 2018-12-03 07:43:11 So you know how during winter you turn on the heat and it uses either electricity or oil or gas and then a utility company sends you a bill and you wish you had just worn more sweaters

Bitcoin is like that but you put your bills on ebay and get other people to pay them.
9995 2018-12-03 07:43:09 But he does take credit for the great economy and for the oil boom. And his people are even starting to believe him.
9996 2018-12-03 07:42:56 Listen the oil market value is a global trend are you telling me Nigeria should sell oil above the normal price fixed by OPEC?
9997 2018-12-03 07:42:31 @martinplaut @DekiSawa The throwing of oil/pouder/eggs stuff on a political commentator, in this case, Martin Plaut, is TERRORISM. And those supporting the wicked act are perpetrators.
