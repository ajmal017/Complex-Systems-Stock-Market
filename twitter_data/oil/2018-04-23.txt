52 2018-04-23 23:52:52 So far still not helpful. They said we shouldn’t have had a mechanic change the oil & they don’t want to talk to him. They also said she should have asked for synthetic but she doesn’t understand automotive stuff. I think they should have educated her about what it needed.

66 2018-04-23 23:50:45 but killed off any industry apart from oil & gas. It quickly becomes too dominant and with inflation, prices you out of other markets.

69 2018-04-23 23:50:11 If the project was profitable, then they'd already have it built and would meet said regulations. Although, I'd agree that imported oil should be subjected to equivalent regulations and perhaps offsetting tariffs.

154 2018-04-23 23:36:26 Maybe a duffle bag in a bus station locker (that he sends a stooge for) filled with C-Notes that smell vaguely of gas and oil?
155 2018-04-23 23:36:20 Ill health effects from  sedentary lifestyles wrought by car dependent communities, respiratory illness from tail pipe emissions, spoiling of water tables from oil and coolant and tire wear, car culture is a massive health crisis and a slow rolling environmental disaster.
156 2018-04-23 23:36:13 Tea tree oil smells weird but so good 
157 2018-04-23 23:36:06 Yes absolutely.  That’s why I said both sell oil & work on green energy.  But knowing that Canada is only 1.67% of the earths CO2 emissions & that no matter what we do we will not impact the much larger polluters that do NOT pay a carbon tax is a bit silly.

169 2018-04-23 23:33:02 What many dont know is that we have done the large army thing, from the oil wars right back to WW1 as a shared goal, we even drill with them constantly , and the international language is English used. An EU army is clever way to mean less spent on arms , more on people.

205 2018-04-23 23:27:29 The beans killed the appetite 
The palm oil buried it

206 2018-04-23 23:27:26 It did not hurt the poor and reduced plastic bag waste in landfills by 50%
207 2018-04-23 23:27:14 Snh I was suppose to clean my car out before gettin my oil changed that shit reekin 
208 2018-04-23 23:27:02 Because he is.  Polarizing doesn't come close to capturing it.  He's a con man, a snake oil salesman, and nothing but.  All other presidents going back to Carter were a mixture of corruption and statesmanship, of greed and servanthood.  Trump, by contrast is an abomination.
209 2018-04-23 23:27:01 @realDonaldTrump When are you going to do something to stop the Texas oil terrorists from raping the economy?  Get the ball rolling for Congress to create legislation to stop these terrorists from crippling the country.
210 2018-04-23 23:26:59 I was taking my other car rn to get an oil change & someone REAR ended me so what I do ??? Kept going ... I don’t got insurance on that car anymore kuz I barely drive it  sooo I SKIRT SKIRTed outta there & had to act like I didn’t just feel that

224 2018-04-23 23:23:09 Go Oil-Free When You Wash!!! Oil-free soaps or washes won’t clog your pores or cause blackheads, acne, and whiteheads. Choose products that are labeled "oil free," "nonacnegenic” (which means it won’t cause acne) or "noncomedogenic” (which means it won’t clog your pores).

227 2018-04-23 23:22:48 I got coffee for a friend in college who got an amazing number of shots plus a lot of flavoring syrups.  I think she said something like "it tastes like motor oil, the syrups help, and it does the job".  I've stayed away from coffee myself.
228 2018-04-23 23:22:47 It’s like oil and water.
229 2018-04-23 23:22:45 If you have a zester, zest the lemons and mix them with the asparagus, oil, salt and pepper to marinate the asparagus. Get the oven preheated to 350 and a pan smoking hot with a little bit of oil in it. Season the salmon and sear it skin side up first
230 2018-04-23 23:22:43 I think there’s snake oil being touted somewhere here.

235 2018-04-23 23:22:15 I've got a great idea, the greatest idea, just the best: sell the strategic oil reserve to anyone who can rustle up $50 and a smile. Either that, or put it on eBay
236 2018-04-23 23:22:11 I took my car to the dealership for an oil change & as soon as i got home I got a Snapchat from my neighbor of the inside of my car saying “your car is in good hands. Glamorous steering wheel btw” 
237 2018-04-23 23:22:02 Katherine mentioned Norway being zero emissions internally but exporting emissions. Very true & a bit hypocritical but very profitable. They have explored this dramatically in a TV Drama "Occupied" where Norway is invaded for refusing to export oil & gas for climate reasons.
238 2018-04-23 23:22:01 Go Oil-Free When You Wash!!! Oil-free soaps or washes won’t clog your pores or cause blackheads, acne, and whiteheads. Choose products that are labeled "oil free," "nonacnegenic” (which means it won’t cause acne) or "noncomedogenic” (which means it won’t clog your pores).

242 2018-04-23 23:21:44 I reckon an exit from oil at $75 a barrel will be fine for me & the proceeds will pay for quite a few bottles of shochu :)
243 2018-04-23 23:21:38 I love how this @seanhannity joker claims to be just a “TV personality” yet he posts “news” stories that his f-ing staff writes. 
Talk about fake news?!
It’s pathetic how many people fall for this snake oil salesman’s BS-  he’s taking in $30 million a year and their naïveté btw.

251 2018-04-23 23:20:03 Yes, that is Henry James dressed in snake oil salesman garb,

271 2018-04-23 23:16:09 Motor oil would be a step up from some of the coffee in the US. As with most things here, you can find some of the best, but unless you hunt for it (and pay through the nose for it once you find it), you are more likely to get some of the worst.

276 2018-04-23 23:15:23 Yes Ari, so let there be no accountability at all for the criminal activity of the Trump White House.  I guess you looked the other way protecting war criminals (yes, creating fake evidence as a rationale for war so you can steal oil is illegal).  Brilliant.

282 2018-04-23 23:14:42 Listened to a full episode of @infowars today. Literally, not joking, 2 full hours of ads for their own vitamins/toothpaste/snake oil mixed with a conservative hour of Alex Jones martyrism. Thrilling stuff!

OIL！
284 2018-04-23 23:13:50 it's OK. Once the oil spill happens, they can clean up the plastics at the same time.
285 2018-04-23 23:13:46 basically, Janet, you cant be a hack and make a profit off snake oil but you can still go take the snake oil for free if you wish. It is restricting profit, why would people wish to profit off the good news anyway? PS it wont hold up in court by the way.
286 2018-04-23 23:13:45 Loc Soap Bars with Lavender , Eucalyptus , tea tree oil , jojoba oil, & honey available soon.
287 2018-04-23 23:13:39 Just got my supply from @Live_Bearded  and already excited used the shampoo and oil. I feel like a million bucks
288 2018-04-23 23:13:38 Switched to a sugar, coconut oil, and lavender scrub
289 2018-04-23 23:13:37 It seems I have misplaced my valve oil

291 2018-04-23 23:13:22 Eric is a professional liar and snake oil salesmen. Period.
292 2018-04-23 23:13:21 i think you are also seeing some oil/gas fields offshore of the Nile delta area.
293 2018-04-23 23:13:14 For what? Look at the electric cars in China and the enormous environmental impact they have on the environment! Give me a gas and oil operated car as I will never go electric. Target effs up again! who shops there anyway?
294 2018-04-23 23:13:05 You need something stronger or try clove oil
295 2018-04-23 23:12:34 Differin made my already oily skin look like the BP oil spill tbh.
296 2018-04-23 23:12:26 Peppermint oil smells so good in bath water, I want to dissolve into this aroma
297 2018-04-23 23:12:24 before I die I want someone to draw me (oil canvas or air brush if air brushed I’d like it to be on a XXL black tee) and I want someone to interview me
298 2018-04-23 23:12:17 It depends on the complexity of the oil pantings and the doodles.
What is more manageable for you?
I think consistency is the most important thing, so choose the one you know you can keep up with, without it being too much.
Personally I prefer weekly content to daily content.
299 2018-04-23 23:12:15 The stupid thing is Seattle did this a while ago and guess who it hurt the most?  THE POOR.  These liberal virtue signalers will never do anything right
300 2018-04-23 23:12:01 Oil up! Gold Down... Dollar Up... Treasuries selling off... what is going on? $GLD $USO $UUP $SHY$SHV
301 2018-04-23 23:11:53 @artnaturals quick question. Patchouli oil says it helps to deter insects - but it’s not listed in the bug spray ingredients. So do we use it alone? My 3 teenage sons and I LOVE your 16 pack!! You guys rock 
302 2018-04-23 23:11:49 Islam vs All religions including Atheist is like oil and water. We bless them, and they curse us. Solution=don't let more in Stop bombing mideast for Israel

306 2018-04-23 23:11:24 i use tea tree oil and it gets rid of my whiteheads overnight!! just make sure to dilute it with water (at first) especially if you have sensitive skin it can really irritate the face. i think it helps with scarring too

314 2018-04-23 23:10:28 *me going on about the lip balm i just got*
me: it’s a coconut oil formula. tastes amazing. feels amazing. 10/10 would recommend.

318 2018-04-23 23:09:58 Their first act was a tanker ban that affects only Alberta oil. Next, Northern Gateway, Energy East and now Kinder Morgan is in doubt. Money well-spent?
319 2018-04-23 23:09:58 Ooh lovely choice - rose oil is such a treat!  Have you tried any of our other rosy goodies?

323 2018-04-23 23:09:44 Live! We all saw it, not hear say, Kiki Osibanjo was there, she launched her body oil, and sold 5000pieces at the price of #5000 per one. You can go and view the video on her IG

326 2018-04-23 23:09:31 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
327 2018-04-23 23:09:21 Yes great day! Made a lot of cash on Oil and Jpy. Thanks for asking how was yours?
328 2018-04-23 23:09:20 If you want i might have some things I can send you! Oil pastels, some soft pastels, I think I have a spare, cheap set of watercolour paints too. Would you like me to have a look? 
329 2018-04-23 23:09:12 GOAL receives fuel and ships veggie oil off to Blue Ridge Biofuels, a first for us and hyper efficient, lowers cost and footprint.

332 2018-04-23 23:08:31 $62 for an oil change i gotta throw the whole car away
333 2018-04-23 23:08:03 Advice from the wolves. Chinese want oil not product and help their own refineries. Russian don’t mind the steady decline of VZ. VZ is just not a good place to invest regardless. VZ could process US crude for smaller investment.
334 2018-04-23 23:07:40 You're absolutely right - Ireland did so well after the crash of 2008 that for decades to come economists will use it as an exemplar of sound policy.

Hang on... 

THE OIL IS WORTHLESS right now. And good economics is to ignore it entirely in future planning.
335 2018-04-23 23:07:31 I have doubts as to whether or not BC will truly benefit in terms of the cost of oil, but by all means send credible sources my way! Not against the pipeline per se but KM has done a shite job on presenting an emergency response plan incl. cost and method of cleanup.
336 2018-04-23 23:07:30 Already done in Cali. Still posses me off when I forget to bring bags into the grocery store.

339 2018-04-23 23:07:06 well the oil would have to be squeezed out periodically....

342 2018-04-23 23:06:22 Clove oil will numb the pain if it is nerve related (without the painkiller risks).
343 2018-04-23 23:06:13 Mf dont even know how to change ya damn oil ya self
344 2018-04-23 23:05:59 I'm not sure , I'm not well up with the Alfie case but I know for sure doctors are always right in the end but I know a few people who was told u will be dead in 3-4 months if don't have chemo they refused and had cannabis oil buying it them self and lived 16 - 24 months happy
345 2018-04-23 23:05:51 Ladies, who knows about the benefits of evening primrose oil? It’s contains GLA which is an anti-inflammatory that supports the production of the type of prostaglandin that results in healthy hormone levels. Good for PMS, insulin sensitivity, skin, hair etc
346 2018-04-23 23:05:50 Glad I got this for our baby dog. Since she's been taking it her dry skin is gone and she hasn't had any hot shot breakouts. Thanks again CBD Oil 
347 2018-04-23 23:05:49 New Plymouth mayor want govt to develop a oil and gas transition plan using expert advice. Funny thing is it is already happening.
348 2018-04-23 23:05:46 nice!
349 2018-04-23 23:05:43 crazy that this is an oil portrait of a mother and daughter, looks so real
350 2018-04-23 23:05:31 Wow music is like essential oil 
351 2018-04-23 23:05:25 The down side is that fur hides the condescending facial expressions on most cats. Seriously, they tend to leave oily spots on furniture and other surfaces because all cats produce oil but it’s to keep the fur properly conditioned. Hairless cats need wiping up after.
352 2018-04-23 23:05:24 Why would they apologize for supporting one of their thought leaders?
353 2018-04-23 23:05:23 Its of no joy to hear millions of hard currency to import wheat and edible oil.
354 2018-04-23 23:05:12 Perfecto! Tengo  oil en casa, solo me falta comprar el coliflor
355 2018-04-23 23:05:11 i generally feel like that too but i LUV their wild rose brightening oil so i might try this out
356 2018-04-23 23:05:09 Now that is bullshit. Anyone who takes you seriously after hyperbole like that is not worth anyone's attention. 200 countries committed because it's in their political interests; leaders of countries don't know science from snake oil.
357 2018-04-23 23:05:08 Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake
358 2018-04-23 23:05:04 I’ve set that as my goal as well. *stockpiles Jamaican black castor oil*
359 2018-04-23 23:04:58 Jamaican castor oil does help yuh beard grow fr? Need a full beard so I can be a whore
360 2018-04-23 23:04:58 The paper argues that bitumen represents a unique challenge when the research says otherwise. Chemically it is extremely similar to other heavy oils and to suggest that decades of research on heavy oil effects on the environment should be reproduced is not justifiable 3/
361 2018-04-23 23:04:54 #DidYouKnow  J. M. W. Turner depicted the fishermen of #Shoeburyness in his oil painting Shoeburyness Fishermen Hailing a Whitstable Hoy.
362 2018-04-23 23:04:44 I don't believe that BamBam's selling 5000 bottles of beauty oil gist ... 

Sounds like a desperate attempt to show that she is 'succeeding'
363 2018-04-23 23:04:32 “One of the most common ways mega-trends emerge is as new tech that opens up massive new design space of opportunity. Examples: The industrial revolution, railroads, oil, cars, semi-conductor, the Internet and now finally crypto” — Kyle Samani
364 2018-04-23 23:04:31 Looks like CommonSpace are now in the snake oil business and confirms they are more anti-SNP than pro-independence. 

No one in the pro-independence movement should be funding this nonsense.
365 2018-04-23 23:04:21 Then we don't need to purchase oil from gulf ,
366 2018-04-23 23:04:11 Crowns, kings, oil, queens, plenty millions, dragged ,boos, etc hmm
367 2018-04-23 23:03:44 I do? The idea was floated by the leader of the #GPC.  And by the way, if you take a global view, the absence of a pipeline will not decrease GHG at all. It merely shifts the oil production and transport to another jurisdiction.
368 2018-04-23 23:03:41 Sometimes I wish I was a basic bitch just settling down with my high school boyfriend where he makes all the money either by the military or the oil rigs and I get t relax ! I wouldn’t care if he cheats on me as long there is no prenup

385 2018-04-23 23:01:22 The only way-out about the soot in Port Harcourt is for government be sincere and proactive about stopping it. Oil  and asphalt companies should be leaved higher taxes cos they are a major source of the soaring soot in the state. Illegal oil bunkering must stop. #stoptheblacksoot
386 2018-04-23 23:00:58 I also wonder if you worry about the sanctity of life like you worry about oil!!!
387 2018-04-23 23:00:51 I decided to clean the garage a bit and found the new oil cooler I’ll never put in my z. Put it up for sale and sold it the next day... I miss selling car parts at the shop, it was so easy

390 2018-04-23 23:00:29 On Friday- I woke up on a plane in the wrong city. (NO ALCOHOL EITHER)! This happens when I don’t have the A-Team! What would I do without my favorite girls (Brinn, Natalie, and Presley) @ #LegacyExploration -We find oil, but I just need help getting there!  .  I you girls.
391 2018-04-23 23:00:16 So how's the oil pan gasket holding up?
392 2018-04-23 23:00:03 What's your favourite essential oil? 
393 2018-04-23 22:59:56 Always had problems with crumbling mascara here in S of France when it's hot then discovered "Tarte's " "Lights Camera Splashes". It's about 25€ but on my 3rd tube. Needs oil (I use coconut) to get it off !
394 2018-04-23 22:59:53 The god's were planting fruit trees,for us humanbeen one this planet earth.! But in this century we eating more meat than vegetable's,its good for your mental health care,to eat sometimes meals with out meat or eggs,with vegetable oil.
395 2018-04-23 22:59:48 Bro came thru with the Sour Apple THC oil... I’m chopped. Where’s bae at with them pwussy videos?
396 2018-04-23 22:59:46 Hold on sea of thieves i'm going to steal you're core concept, change you into pirate robots and make the ship metal and also the ocean oil and call it, ocean of grease.
397 2018-04-23 22:59:38 Not cool dude. It’s way to soon to start discussing vehicle reform! Have a heart! So insensitive!! 
398 2018-04-23 22:59:34 For treating almost every skin condition in the world, you can find an essential oil with great benefits. Aging skin is a very common condition most people tend to face, and naturally, there exists a whole bunch of essential oils that can effectively fight signs of aging.
399 2018-04-23 22:59:32 Good for Bambam, I don’t stan her but she is being smart, her oil sold out in 1 day, even if she only takes half of it home that is 12.5M so should restock in like 2 weeks to a month so ppl will appreciate it and think of it as scarce. Smart girl...
400 2018-04-23 22:59:28 Isn't Butts busy covering up his payout from anti oil foundations? Crooked little bastard ,our Butt's.
401 2018-04-23 22:59:26 I thought you had a girlfriend for that
402 2018-04-23 22:59:19 Come and watch the oil slick making there way home from Royton back to Oldham
403 2018-04-23 22:59:13 That's what women are for, tho?

405 2018-04-23 22:58:59 I just stole my business model from the ghetty oil saga drama on tv. And it works!
406 2018-04-23 22:58:52 Worse than that, he often comes off as a snake oil salesman, with, as you say, no plans but lots of pie in the sky promises.

410 2018-04-23 22:58:31 boy: sou o meireles

this is sad 1 like for the virgin olive oil foundation
411 2018-04-23 22:58:28 All that oil show's off that sexy tan, luvin it!!
412 2018-04-23 22:58:20 I heard somewhere that a baking soda paste can take residual pepper oils/acids off your hands. Also vegetable oil or alcohol can dissolve it.
413 2018-04-23 22:58:02 Rule 1: if you find yourself in a hole, stop digging. Anyone who defends a sexual predator & snake oil merchant like Trump is in no position to offer commentary on matters of vulgarity. Go burn a cross somewhere.
414 2018-04-23 22:57:38 One guy like that, who apparently holds a post in Delta but prior to that had oil businesses
415 2018-04-23 22:57:04 Oh dear. Mineral assets? We're getting dangerously close to the "oil will make us rich!" bull 

Actually it's quite similar. A country's history of debt servicing does contribute to its ability to borrow. And remember, its government assets, not anything in Scotland
416 2018-04-23 22:56:39 Tired of libs like you lying about everything. Wall is necessary to keep the trash out. Oil does no harm to the earth as it comes from the earth. Fair housing is available for those who work for a living and we have the 2nd Amendment for our gun control.
417 2018-04-23 22:56:36 It's true when you plant a tree every time you cut one down. Unlike oil, trees can be renewed.
418 2018-04-23 22:56:24 PSA: tea tree oil is great for getting rid of period spots
419 2018-04-23 22:55:56 Lmaoo is this the first time you getting a oil change ??
420 2018-04-23 22:55:44 #Oil exporters leave aside the #dollar. The International Mercantile Exchange of #SanPetersburgo quotes Russian oil in #rublos. #Venezuela replaced them with #euros. The Stock Exchange of #Shanghai began selling oil contracts for the future in #yuanes #23Abr #ICS #News
421 2018-04-23 22:55:40 Whether she is really selling the oil or not o, I don't care. I'm still happy for her.
422 2018-04-23 22:55:37 My hands smell like oil/grease. I’ve washed them half a dozen times. 
423 2018-04-23 22:55:21 Why would you let @EPAScottPruitt near children? I hope he told them how he is devastating their future planet so that he & his oil/gas/chem/coal Friends can buy buy bigger houses. What a shame 4 these children.  #BootPruitt
424 2018-04-23 22:55:17 thankful for my sister bringing me coconut oil and other things when i had an allergic reaction because i used the wrong tanning lotion 
425 2018-04-23 22:54:59 I've been hearing bad things about castor oil lately so I'm scared lol but I've been walking up & down the steps 
426 2018-04-23 22:54:56 if anyone’s in Salinas & wants to grab a drink while I wait for my oil change to be done let me knooooowww, I’m super free until my 5:30 meeting 
427 2018-04-23 22:54:44 The poor should be going to the church and/or charities for aid.  Taxpayer money should not be used to take care of the poor.  And if you understood Jesus’s ministry, you would know that while He directed as such, it was to be done through charity, not the government.

431 2018-04-23 22:54:00 Getting an oil change, downwind in the waiting room from a baby with a shitty diaper. 

This is pretty awful.
432 2018-04-23 22:53:52 weird that RTÉ have yet to ask me for footage of my first time using argan oil for the 2017 episode of Reeling in the Years
433 2018-04-23 22:53:32 No #OPEC and no #NEWS lead the way to Crude Oil. It isn't demand directly, it's investors who make decisions to buy or sell Crude Oil on Commodity Futures Market. Apparently 99.99% of chances you will loose your money you place on Crude Oil Commodities. Unless you bet against JPM
434 2018-04-23 22:53:26 I'll say the season premiere scene in 1984, when Cliff was out in his car passed out, & Jackie spotted him, and inform him that Gold Canyon 340 came in, &he realized that J.R. didn't clean him out,& he struck oil. "You mean I won, Jackie said yes, you mean then I beat J.R., yes.
435 2018-04-23 22:53:25 Silver is where you place your bet and where I believe you’ll make the biggest gains, compared to 100 barrels of oil, ten tonnes of copper and so on. 
There are many other reasons too, but really you should look into it yourself first and ask questions later to fill the gaps

446 2018-04-23 22:52:06 That is how they pay him off for all the policies Koch brothers wanted him to pass. Oil can do no wrong. Want to drill in A nationa park, no problem, he will sign an order, after all he thinks he is the King, no one else can say anything about it. Shame on GOP.

451 2018-04-23 22:51:04 So many things, not enough space. I get what your saying, yes most do just follow blindly, I don’t. I’ve bet a house worth on it so have done my own research. You’re playing the whole commodity space here, not just silver. Everything will rocket, oil being the lead.

569 2018-04-23 22:37:06 He bodied his verse on oil money, my gard
570 2018-04-23 22:37:03 hey, @JTFreshly we aren't interested in ANY of your products. you sell snake oil to people. that's exploiting the ignorant for money. go away.
571 2018-04-23 22:36:45 Some dude are here defending the action of buhari for withdrawing $425 millions from excess crude oil account without the approval of the @nassnigeria ..pleaae let us take a chill pill cos things has to follow due process, same thing u castigated the previous GOVT on...
572 2018-04-23 22:36:38 I'm actually amazed at how much more quickly he achieved "Cindy Sheehan irrelevance" than she did.
573 2018-04-23 22:36:33 No ive only been going since 1974 impossible really as we have only existed since 2008 but hey ho..whos the ignorant one really? No doubt oil money will be your next little dig the fact we won a european trophy before you may have escaped your attention?
574 2018-04-23 22:36:33 ! It’s partly symbolic (because existing licences have decades to run), but new drilling exploration has been cancelled here. Those with oil in their veins are upset.
575 2018-04-23 22:36:25 No because of their knowledge. The oil industry alone has benefited massively from both Indian and Asian immigrants. To put it simply for you: They do science and math more better.
576 2018-04-23 22:36:08 Tiger, not in the tank? .  "Put a tiger in your tank" was once the slogan of Esso (US Standard Oil), at least here in Australia.  Where everything is upside down. 
577 2018-04-23 22:35:52 I liked it. Will try it with olive oil and olives. Rich texture, nothing like tofu.
578 2018-04-23 22:35:45 An honorary degree is functionally a meaningless designation. Profs and donors at @UAlberta upset over Suzuki getting one because he smack talked the oil sands really shows how entitled that industry is. #yeg
579 2018-04-23 22:35:30 The issue not addressed in the story or by the protesters is what alternative are they offering? Pipelines are safer than oil-by-rail which is the other likely alternative.
580 2018-04-23 22:35:26 I understand usually when a women moves to this part of ND it’s because her husband works oil fields. But that’s not my case.
581 2018-04-23 22:35:21 @blade046 congratulations o. But I don't know why I never see when you post your CS.... Oil dey your head sha... May it never dry
582 2018-04-23 22:35:21 Yea, them prescriptions be having steroids n shit. Those are what I prefer but almost any organic oil better ( argon, tea tree, and Shea butter)
583 2018-04-23 22:35:20 You know that "oil companies dont like me" is still good press for anyone worth a damn, right?

598 2018-04-23 22:32:22 get yourself a beard wash, beard oil, and hard comb. Since your beard is a bit short I'd opt for beard balm to keep your skin hydrated underneath the beard at all times. Don't Shave your beard. its haram to shave if you have one. Trim it if you like to level it out. Bi'ithnillah.

661 2018-04-23 22:23:10 Next (gut wrenching) step is gun point employment. The military, to keep food flowing into their barracks, will adopt virtual slavery in order to pump whatever oil they can manage to smuggle, trade, or burn.

This now moves #crude oil inventories down into the lower half of the range for this time of year.

711 2018-04-23 22:15:45 #mining $GLD #energy #economy $ES $OIL We partnered with NASA TheWCS and KeringGroup to create the Sustainable Cashmere Project, improving the lives of the community in the South Gobi desert. The life of our mine in Mongolia is 50 years, and we're in for the long haul.
712 2018-04-23 22:15:43 I had a dream about @ThomasSanders that I massaged his legs and oil started to come out of his seams and I’m convinced he’s a robot.
713 2018-04-23 22:15:27 Moisturizer, primer then oil. Oil just helps me because i have some dry skin so it keeps my makeup from looking flaky or dry
714 2018-04-23 22:15:24 For consumption, make money on coal, and O&G (on its own Pipes) from BC, increase its LNG pipes then turn around and stop AB from growth. It is protectionist. I want O&G to wane as well, but am I pragmatic. Then we have Que. on the other side preferring Saudi Oil than ours. 2/2
715 2018-04-23 22:15:16 They could care less about green space just like oil companies could care less about polluting the water and air.
716 2018-04-23 22:15:13 I need someone to change my oil 
717 2018-04-23 22:15:09 @bob_miller oil money, families that got rich off oil will now get richer with this centuries’s oil/BTC rush.
718 2018-04-23 22:15:05 Confunde muchos términos. La producción en pozos convencionales viene recuperando luego d una fuerte baja. El breakeven está muy cerca. El shale oil en VM viene con ascensos muy fuertes y más aún el tight gas. En conjunto la producción total está ahí nomas de estar nivelada.
719 2018-04-23 22:15:04 I love bambam BUT this is fake news... this is just a marketing scheme to hype her oil line
720 2018-04-23 22:15:04 Too late. Given current political climate it didn't occur,  backlash would ensue? I don't buy the weak excuse. #BoycottYetiCoolers

722 2018-04-23 22:14:50 You can't be serious. Pioneer spirit? It had all the courage of a pat Guardian editorial with half the grace. (And I loved "Oil" btw.)
723 2018-04-23 22:14:36 First, romaine, then eggs. All we need now, are recalls on olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, dijon mustard, anchovy paste, and parmesan, and we'll have an anti-Caesar salad conspiracy.
724 2018-04-23 22:14:26 @Luhrisuh is a fake car girl, she doesn’t even change her own oil.
725 2018-04-23 22:14:15 But you've also proven that little if any oil I may use is a result of, as you insisted,  "IMPORTS oil from countries that have shitty human rights policies"

But, as usual, losers move the golaposts
726 2018-04-23 22:13:56 You people will not allow this girl sell in peace with false news. Someone that is still selling her oil on IG live, e say sold out.

lots of interruptions with the farm hand starting work today.

Instead of 6,000 words, got just 2,000 done.

Still, got some good info on chainsaws, bars, chains, tooth profile, hand sharpening, power sharpening, bar oil, 2-stroke fuel, etc.

Onward.
744 2018-04-23 22:10:59 So she sold d exact bottle of her beauty oil that equaled d bbnaija grand prize huh?! Don’t know who’s more gullible...u or those who actually believe it
745 2018-04-23 22:10:54 The increase in the dollar is disguising the increase in BTC in other currencies.  It is also hiding the alarming( to TPTB) rise in the price of oil.
746 2018-04-23 22:10:53 you gotta loosen some shit under that hoe and then let the oil drain out then tighten it back up of course and then put the new oil in

760 2018-04-23 22:08:21 Hat tip to @GraveB4Shave for their Cigar blend (Tobacco and Vanilla) beard oil! 

Beard is softer,  more manageable, and the fragrance is amazing.  Makes me thinks of leather bound books, in a personal study. 

(Bay Rum is OK, but not very Bay or Rum... though.)

763 2018-04-23 22:07:43 I changed the oil of my car last week, and today it marked that I need oil change 
764 2018-04-23 22:07:42 A woman I really look up to at work helped me with a project today and I told her she was the floral-scented wind beneath my wings. I blame the essential oil mister she had going for blocking my ability to think straight. She was cool but I  had to leave to go dig a hole.

Capitalism doesn't exist, not in either the UK or the US. We believe strongly in socialism when it comes to the benefit of large banks, oil and ag companies.

785 2018-04-23 22:04:08 Just to be clear, @RandPaul, the mistake  @realDonaldTrump thinks we made is "not taking the oil".
786 2018-04-23 22:03:54 @PrisonPlanet Paul JW shills snake oil to promote virility and masculinity.  And yet he has to be most feminine dude I've ever seen.  Paul, you have the doe eyes and pouty lips of a woman.  That and I doubt you could ever fight your way out of a wet paper bag.
787 2018-04-23 22:03:52 I'm guessing they live just up the street from the single lady who wants to meet me, and they know the one secret that the oil companies don't want me to know.
788 2018-04-23 22:03:50 Yeah I use like one drop mixed in a cup of water to super dilute the tree tea oil. Tree Tea Oil is intense.

796 2018-04-23 22:03:01 It still is. That's why pharmaceutical are pushed instead of actual Healthcare & our food is sprayed with the waste of the oil industry..herbicides, fungacides, pesticides, like GMOs which are designed to feed off pesticides & 24D which is agent orange.

808 2018-04-23 22:01:55 I  vote Democrat  because I believe oil companies' profits of 4% on a  gallon of gas are  obscene, but the government taxing the same gallon at 15%  isn't.

832 2018-04-23 21:59:41 I had the same problem. I used tree tea oil mix with salt and water — fixed the problem in a week.
833 2018-04-23 21:59:34 @griffinchevywi can’t believe how incompetent your express service techs are. Maybe some day they can clean up the oil after an oil change so it isn’t dripping all over the garage floor and set tire pressures correctly.

897 2018-04-23 21:50:39 @PepsiCo - please stop trying to greenwash the loophole in your #palmoil policy. It allows your business partners to destroy rainforests and exploit workers. Fix your palm oil policy and end your role in deforestation and exploitation!

903 2018-04-23 21:49:44 Have wondered for two years now whether Pruitt is simply on the take, or a true believer. Perhaps it's both. Here's an easier take: Pruitt's actions at EPA seem especially crucial to an executive scheme (Trump) that governs capital flows from Oil and Gas complex. cc @joshtpm
904 2018-04-23 21:49:31 But that might have something to do with oil and something to do with banks, etc.? Plus neither seem to insist on quite the same red lines now put forward by the UK?
905 2018-04-23 21:49:24 TMX is just going to drop NA inflation down, get more royalties for Canada and diversify our oil suppliers so we are not at the mercy of OPEC. Annually efficiencies in heavy oil grows and extraction costs drop. Case in point,  US Gulf owned Saudi refinery.

94 percent of humans are born with antibodies to peanut lectin.The lectin produces atherosclerosis in experimental primate cousins the rhesus monkey but when removed from the oil, atherosclerosis does not develop.

989 2018-04-23 21:39:51 @realDonaldTrump Dear Mr Trump I appreciate the tax cuts but you didn't say we would have to use it to fill our gas tanks. More money to the muslin countries our tax dollars use some of our oil and starve them over there.

991 2018-04-23 21:39:41 wish I had some dark tannin oil
992 2018-04-23 21:39:25 Yes, and it's loosely inspired by true events  A scandal erupts in Brazil during an investigation of alleged government corruption via oil and construction companies, but it's all so well explained, I love investigation shows
993 2018-04-23 21:39:25 I know my; my takes a lot of heat when I get a wash and set. But the lack of oil and heat protectant I see with his hair makes me wary that he’ll have strands that’ll stay straight/ break aways.

1001 2018-04-23 21:37:43 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts walnut oil with 1 part grapefruit juice and 1 part miso. Add chili peppers and molasses to taste.
1002 2018-04-23 21:37:40 I love cooking meals with my bf....that is until he tries to throw water on me or touch my shirt with olive oil.

1004 2018-04-23 21:37:33 Billions in new highways, cheap farm land, oil and gas subsidies, biased state budgets- all subsidize expensive new suburbs. These new communities are not economically of financially viable long-term, simultaneously relying on cities while extracting resources inefficently.

1006 2018-04-23 21:37:25 You should consider using CBD oil, or a CBD lip balm
1007 2018-04-23 21:37:17 I feel so disrespected by people with perfect skin because I’ve been following my skincare regimen for a good month and yet the acne and oil and also dryness remain
1008 2018-04-23 21:37:10 This was what he said: "More than 60 percent of the population is below 30, a lot of them haven't been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit and do nothing, and get housing, healthcare, education free."
1009 2018-04-23 21:37:04 Oil or watercolor?  for a reason I feel that oils are more complete but watercolors’ aesthetic is softer but strong

1014 2018-04-23 21:35:45 Anyone who is still buying what this snake oil salesman is selling has no one to blame but themselves.  But while they delude themselves, the rest of the country foots the bill.

1017 2018-04-23 21:35:20 Oil is a dying industry. Time to accept it shrinking in the face of non-polluting alternatives
1018 2018-04-23 21:35:07 What Dr. Hollebone says is absolutely correct and something I have said numerous times. Any spill would have significant effect and would behave a lot like any other heavy oil spill. That is why you want to transport the material in the safest way possible.
1019 2018-04-23 21:35:05 I’m no physician, but if an essential oil gives you an immune response, isn’t that, like, a really bad thing? 

Is your lavender/pine/zen oil contaminated with C. perfringens? 

Do you have an allergy? 

Do you have an autoimmune disease?
1020 2018-04-23 21:34:51 "a new technology... that turns bitumen – the heavy crude produced at the oil sands – into a mostly solid dry good, by mixing and wrapping it with polymer. In the event of an accident, the packets would not explode, leak, or sink in water..."

1025 2018-04-23 21:34:13 I’m organizing a walkout of sorts. I think I will drive down to the AAA service center and cuss out the guy changing oil. He’ll be woke after I finish with him.
1026 2018-04-23 21:34:12 Sorry, I guess I read too much into "virtue-signalling," the "no likelihood" of meeting just-stated targets, and the "falling over themselves... to establish green credentials" while doing little or nothing to rein in oil use. My bad.

1029 2018-04-23 21:33:40 You can bet that with Canada running a deficit and world oil prices rising but Canadian oil sold at a larger and larger discount, the feds will be MORE interested in unlocking our dependence on our American buyers. Why are American interests funding anti-pipeline activists?

1034 2018-04-23 21:33:00 The system design keeps those digging holes to dig to the hot magma core where it all burns up. The bottom 99% borrow and keep digging themselves into holes.  Students should trade crude oil options with the extra loan money for tuition.  Give them a shot at a dream 
1035 2018-04-23 21:32:58 Why have oil companies taken measures to protect their assets against climate change?  You refuse to answer questions.
1036 2018-04-23 21:32:57 Hmm Nigerian youth are lazy. Our president said we are waiting for oil money to spend. But please ohh what money is HE USING TO TRAVEL AND PAYING FOR HIS HOSPITAL BILLS ABROAD??

1041 2018-04-23 21:32:04 There would have been so much room for negotiation how to use the twinned pipe for local purposes, minimizing both oil tanker and oil railcar traffic. Unfort'ly radical elements in Burnaby have hijacked this issue to advance their re-election agenda. Now, it's all black-and-white
1042 2018-04-23 21:32:03 Is this to make up for all the trees getting torn down to make room for all those oil rigs out west?

1060 2018-04-23 21:29:21 I agree. Even though there is global over refining capacity and the market is for oil, so spending billion$ on a new refinery would be a risky venture. But accepting there is a business case, it would need to be built near the demand, on the Vancouver coast. Any Green takers?

1079 2018-04-23 21:26:37 I tried various strains, mostly indica dominant/edibles/CBD oil...not at the same time either. Cannabis and I do not resonate, simple as that. Plus, NO pain relief with any of it. Pot makes me high too. I don't like feeling high. CBD oil felt no relief.
1080 2018-04-23 21:26:36 Each province sets their taxes. BC can apply any taxes it wishes to support the economy here. Alberta for example pays no sales tax, mainly b/c of the Oil patch. So you've already an advantage over BC households to buy here. Is that "envy"? No. Taxes incl. income tx pay for infra

1085 2018-04-23 21:25:24 No one disagrees with the fact that if you send raw product out of the country you loose jobs but the fact is you want the oil industry to stop all together no one in Canada wants to invest in infrastructure because of uncertainty of political climate

I’m going to say in amendment, sesame oil to taste. If you don’t like it, use less or remove in favor of more lime juice or water.

1134 2018-04-23 21:18:06 Corporations are taking their tax scam breaks and putting them in black hole tax sites where you will never see the money again. Those new jobs are pitiful. The new jobs are cleaning up coal and cleaning up oil spills. really nice jobs .

1151 2018-04-23 21:16:12 £16000 is what we paid Iran for oil rights or so I've read. Even circa 1905 that doesn't sound like a lot of money. Or put another way , were we taking the Pxxx.

1153 2018-04-23 21:15:57 Just before the bottom fell out of oil and electricity when nuts I got so frustrated with the oil companies that  I actually threw the oil furnace out in the yard and had it replaced with an electric hot water radiation system.  I'm a dum dum.
1154 2018-04-23 21:15:51 If you fail diplomatically, be aware that you have chosen the path of treachery, you will be in trouble !
perhaps oil will run out before 2050.
1155 2018-04-23 21:15:51 Sounds strange but a big help in PD fatigue is exercise. Well it's good for many reasons but, strangely, reduces fatigue.

1162 2018-04-23 21:14:14 Having worked in the oil patch in Canada I’m no fan of foreign companies from places with poor environmental records funding protests here. The worst are from around San Francisco, which ignore the Cali oil sands to protest here, and our emissions are lower per barrel
1163 2018-04-23 21:14:09 Iran stealing Iraqi oil by drilling oil wells near international border with Iraq in Majnoon field. Iran knows that Qatar gas field extends in the Gulf.

1196 2018-04-23 21:09:25 I had to google flavacol. Had no idea that exists & is available for individual purchase! I just always assumed it was a “secret recipe” sealed in a vault somewhere. Haha. And coconut oil? I’m guessing you’ll need the refined stuff to avoid the coconutty/fruity flavor?
1197 2018-04-23 21:09:24 many salad dressings have more oil than that anyway..
1198 2018-04-23 21:09:08 I hope you washed your hands. Called oil beetles for the irritant oils they secrete. Also called blister beetles for the skin blisters caused by the oils. Cantharidin more poisonous than curare.

1200 2018-04-23 21:08:59 I get one of those wax/oil burner things and add some Olbas to it, and I put Vicks vaporub actually in my nostrils. It helps so much.
1201 2018-04-23 21:08:55 The oil is going to the coast with or without the pipeline.
1202 2018-04-23 21:08:50 I don't know any person that that has seen "crude oil", do they actually pump it from the ground? #palmoil
1203 2018-04-23 21:08:43 Trying to play the economist again?
Cheap oil undermines your critical allies like the Saudis & Texas & Kochlandistan.
US exports (vs switching to non fossil) add to global warming which hurts critical allies like India, Indonesia, FLA MISS & ALA.
High prices leads to switching.

1206 2018-04-23 21:08:32 Heading towards the @CleanWaterACWA event in Ann arbor Michigan. Line 5 retirement party.

1221 2018-04-23 21:06:50 Sorry but the future is green and we will be left behind as we refocus on oil. Get the coal miner out of the mines killing them and onto wind turbines. Why is he reducing car emissions? Why not maximize reserves to reduce dependence? Because they cant make money that's why.
1222 2018-04-23 21:06:49 My hubby is an oil guy... @goturcoffeefix he travels through Omaha  I’m going to tell him to stop in your place
1223 2018-04-23 21:06:31 Took my car to get the oil changed. Attendant told me, "LOL wow you can't drive this, can you? You drive this? "

He stalled it driving off.

1228 2018-04-23 21:05:36 Koch Industries has donated $375,500 to Pompeo's campaigns. In Congress, he pushed legislation to end tax breaks for renewables and curb regulations on oil and gas. He also wrote an op-ed titled, "Stop Harassing the Koch Brothers." Facts...

1237 2018-04-23 21:04:02 Maybe we all just need to develop a different spirituality of life, ethos, and sense of place and purpose. Maybe instead of taking “fish oil pills”. We just eat a little better, AND accept our mortality instead of focusing on living forever?

1239 2018-04-23 21:03:44 probably & their current demise is evidence of poor governance & bad policies, there are many oil rich OPEC nations fraught w/ bad government & corruption, citizens live poorly despite price of oil or energy demands.

1382 2018-04-23 20:44:51 Totally agree! Half of the challenge is getting the mind accustomed to new habits and remembering how great things like kale and spinach taste when boiled or lightly fried in olive oil (that's OK, isn't it?). The book is my Bible, now!

Slowed climate change.

1394 2018-04-23 20:43:00 CBD is still just weed. You don;t need to make an oil. You can smoke it. I'm getting at the fact that the price is going to drop and the industry is not going to be as big as they say by about 90%.

1443 2018-04-23 20:36:58 The dollar is only one factor in the price of oil.. Demand, supply interruptions, potential supply interruptions, OPEC statements, Rig count... They all play a part.

1523 2018-04-23 20:26:21 Another tweet from the “I know absolutely nothing about costs of production in the oil and gas industry” drill, baby, drill echo chamber. You know as much about how your energy is produced as you know about where your food comes from.
1524 2018-04-23 20:26:19 LITTLE-the only little thing is my bum-her hands cover a cheek & come down with the regularity & strength of an oil derrick pounding away. When she hits thighs the world turns upside down-try it weekly like me-no choice-I'm the whipping boy. it's nearly Thursday for my next dose!
1525 2018-04-23 20:26:03 Don't know if you would ever need this on the "dystopia beat," but there is an interesting site @TankerTrackers for following movement of oil around the world, useful for areas of unrest.
1526 2018-04-23 20:25:45 Literally @tasty’s recipe but vegetable oil instead of coconut
1527 2018-04-23 20:25:42 @SamuelSThorp "Watch this video about how to write a book on how to write a course about making money on the internet..." etc.
Hypothesis: when it's snake oil, the more layers of obfuscation added, the less likely anyone will ever twig it's bunkum?
1528 2018-04-23 20:25:25 Do you also want them to guarantee there’ll be no car or plane accidents? Be realistic- Look at all the oil tankers crossing the world. Why aren’t you protesting the tankers that go thru lower mainland waters from US up to Alaska?
1529 2018-04-23 20:25:21 its like they think they are proving something.

only thing proven is they are but a small band of coal & oil biggots who are paid to lie 

Indeed it is all about the money
1530 2018-04-23 20:25:19 So what happened today? Guess all things were not equal Oil up eur down
1531 2018-04-23 20:25:14 Absolutely love mine... cleans up nicely too... just don't use a scourer/abrasive sponge on it too hard as it's the scratches that'll end up being hard to clean... the inlays are good if you've only one pelican and using multiple colours in one day or glossing with oil...

1534 2018-04-23 20:25:05 #Saskatchewan has followed #Alberta's lead and introduced legislation to control the flow of its oil and gas exports.

1544 2018-04-23 20:23:23 Very few have passion for being an offshore oil rig worker. But the world needs them so wages are high. Teachers by and large need very little financial enticement simply because they “love what they do.”

1548 2018-04-23 20:23:16 What’s fake oil money? Are you implying it was counterfeit money? Pretty sure it’s all done by bank to bank transfer though. Perhaps you could orovide some ANALYSIS on this.
1549 2018-04-23 20:23:03 What should make the electorate raise their brows is the fact that instead of raising pertinent issues dealing with basic necessities like increasing oil prices, unemployment & farmer’s distress, the principal opposition is playing its political cards against the #BJP.

1561 2018-04-23 20:21:46 #DonaldTrump  regarding oil prices, as we pump a lot of oil you still would not see a decrease until you build refineries and get them on line, we cannot refine what we have fast enough! Also we have like 11different blends of gasoline go down to3  would lower prices at pump
1562 2018-04-23 20:21:39 There is oil there. Let's see how big. I'm convinced. Why bother with a support vessel or the other auxiliary ship? If there was/is nothing there they'd have upped and left by now. I hope its 2018s biggest find. #CHAR

1623 2018-04-23 20:14:18 @SenatorCantwell I'm sorry to say your state my be next to be taken advantage of just like the Alaskan Wildlife Refuge.  Did you ever think that it would be ok to "explore" there for gas and oil?  The people who live there and have kept it pristene didn't think so either.
1624 2018-04-23 20:14:09 Unless oil stays at or above approx. 70 bucks a barrel there will be limited exploration. Cheaper to buy it.
1625 2018-04-23 20:13:57 I’m always scared that I’m gonna fall into that little hole at oil changing places because I’m a fucking spaz sometimes
1626 2018-04-23 20:13:51 I believe Libya happened because Qaddafi was trying to change oil currency from dollars to dinars.

I’m not looking to gain from this . Just get well
1641 2018-04-23 20:11:34 hopefully that's mud and not oil!
1642 2018-04-23 20:11:30 Hell yes! You can use any oil honestly- i put it in the pot I’m melting chocolate in so the chocolate won’t burn. You can do any sweet or low flavor oil since it doesn’t affect the taste at all :)
1643 2018-04-23 20:11:23 I bought a new mattress last week, and have been putting lavender oil on the pillow - it may be psycosomatic but I've been sleeping a lot better recently.
1644 2018-04-23 20:11:05 I have heard ppl have great results with the niacinamide but my skin doesn’t like it! the glycolic toner, alpha lipoic (potent so I add a drop of  their argan oil), the AHA peel and buffet. and both vitamin c’s and buffet. hahaha. I use the 5% retinoids as well
1645 2018-04-23 20:11:04 my big decision is always olive oil based or mayo based.
1646 2018-04-23 20:11:04 No shit Sherlock, of course climate has changed since the beginning. The difference here is that this climate change is happening faster than any climate change before it, which also happens to coincide with the industrial revolution- where carbon sinks of oil are released...
1647 2018-04-23 20:10:48 Probably pro oil extremists- they are very violent
1648 2018-04-23 20:10:31 Really? I know Oman. It's a country with 4.4 million people, comprising entirely of rock and desert and by Gulf standards tiny amounts of oil. Good for dates though.

1656 2018-04-23 20:10:04 I would get two fire pages when I’m at the dealership across the county waiting on an oil change

1665 2018-04-23 20:08:38 Can we please stop putting coconut oil in lip balms? Or lotions, or water, or just quit doing coconut everything in general?

1681 2018-04-23 20:05:28 I hear that! SLC had air quality like Beijing in the winter every year. (It was PM2.5 from trapped auto, mining & oil refinery pollution during inversions). 

Couldn’t see buildings across the street through the thick smog. I had a lot of PFTs during those times — always hurt!
1682 2018-04-23 20:05:24 Maybe they could get the oil subsidies...
1683 2018-04-23 20:05:22 Environmental conservation and resource development go hand in hand. Oil and gas people are big time outdoors men and women. Everyone in Canada should take pride in our world class engineering and design to prevent incidents. When enviro’s say we don’t care, it’s an attack.
1684 2018-04-23 20:05:15 3 years in office.

Not even one bedroom  house abroad.
No house in Abuja.
No oil wells. 
Not even a single petrol filling Station. 

These and more are what made us die hard Buharists.
That made us support him. 
That made us love him. 

Integrity matters
1685 2018-04-23 20:05:06 I can't speak directly to the concerns of the UofA engineering faculty, but I suspect similar concerns. A lot of UofA ENGG research activities are aimed at lowering the Steam Oil ratio in oil sands extraction thereby reducing the greenhouse gas emissions intensity of the industry
1686 2018-04-23 20:05:02 Yes, particulates are a problem, but - follow me here - not a *carbon* issue.
The carbon problem comes from releasing carbon from another geological era into the atmosphere.
I would prefer we focus on actual, serious issues. Coal. Oil. Natural gas. 
Wood heat is pretty far down.

1712 2018-04-23 20:01:08 The demand for oil is expected to increase annually well into 2040s. You cannot reduce this demand by limiting the production in Canada. The demand will just be met by someone else. This just damages Canada's economy.
1713 2018-04-23 20:00:58 There is a quick and simple way to find out who needs Alberta oil. Just turn off the taps on the current pipeline. Problem solved, hypocrite

1735 2018-04-23 19:57:36 China on the move!  The US $21 trillion+ in debt and parts of the world moving off the dollar as base / oil currency doesn’t bode well for the not so distant future.  Maybe we can keep a grip on #2

1752 2018-04-23 19:55:38 Nonsense.  The Yanks had bombed ISIS for 2 years and achieved nothing, ISIS were still advancing. Within 2 months the Russians had stopped and reversed ISIS and bombed their oil convoys for the first time in the conflict. The US had left those alone for some reason.

"The Emperor's Tomb" (Cotton Malone #6) centers on the famous tomb in China with the terra cotta army, with a non-stop plot about a power struggle for control of the country. Fascinating insights into China, plus a VERY intriguing, real theory about the earth's oil supply!
1756 2018-04-23 19:54:48 I had one call and wish me Happy Bday , then called and told me I needed an oil change , then that I had left my lights on and then that I should be wearing a coat cuz I looked cold. They were stalking me  lol

The most effective way to contribute is taxes, so long as the governing body allocates this funding properly to the needs of the people instead of war and oil. Countries w/o tax are undeveloped.
1770 2018-04-23 19:53:25 Because you have not put oil on it yet?

1781 2018-04-23 19:51:33 As I come across them I will send them your way. I just know what I read as I come across it. Just spent a career doing corporate (all industries, not just oil and gas) research.
1782 2018-04-23 19:51:32 Tammy, I was told many years ago that America will always use other nations oil first. We are saving ours for when they run out. Makes sense to me.
1783 2018-04-23 19:51:18 FWIW, the massive short vol position in equities that partially unwound in Feb, is also a massive feature of bond, oil, copper, corn, wheat, Nat gas and FX. All the same asset managers have been selling huge amounts of volatility for yield enhancement. Vol is infectious...
1784 2018-04-23 19:50:37 Cos we have oil.
1785 2018-04-23 19:50:31 Omg thanks I’m going to save this for next time this is fantastic. Does it have a preferred oil for the pan or nah?

1791 2018-04-23 19:49:49 How convenient for the British host of Last Week Tonight to omit the reason for the CIA’s involvement in the Iranian coup:

British Petroleum was in danger of losing oil fields!
1792 2018-04-23 19:49:43 India is relatively  isolated/self-contained. UAE is Open for trade ( OIL ). Their products differ too in terms of world desirability.
1793 2018-04-23 19:49:38 No oil involved
1794 2018-04-23 19:49:34 The Federal government of Nigeria has to work in synergy with the  Rivers state government and ensure the worsening air pollution going on in the oil rich Niger delta is immediately stopped as millions of people are at risk of dying prematurely with respiratory illnesses.

1797 2018-04-23 19:49:22 same report: "The strategist said a steep rise in prices would add further pressure on global economy which is already showing signs of weakness. 'That’s what could put a ceiling on oil prices,' "

1812 2018-04-23 19:47:56 Trump said that US troops would leave Syria soon but it doesnt look like that and Macron says that they will stay left there to "help" to rebuild Syria. I guess that they want to take over all the oil sources in Deir el Zoor area in the hands od SDF now

1919 2018-04-23 19:35:49 Is he serious? Oil is not cheap

1924 2018-04-23 19:34:37 I printed out a little card with my info, because I had to meet a lot of people there.
I had to talk to this one oil and gas executive, and when I gave him my card, he chuckled under his breath because it wasn't a fancy company email address.
1925 2018-04-23 19:34:37 Go in for an oil change. I gotta buy new tires. I sincerely hate “owning” a car.
1926 2018-04-23 19:34:16 The curve doesn't price in events not priced in. Being part of the herd doesn't return you more than the risk you take.  Everyone is hopping onto long oil after its up $9 in a month.  Think about this herd mentality right now for future returns buying up here.
1927 2018-04-23 19:34:05 Wouldn't you rather an honest & shy leader than a snake oil salesman?
1928 2018-04-23 19:34:02 I will leave you lots of petrol and diesel and motor oil for the tractors and the cars and the generators! And you will need the generators! There won't be any electric cables left!

1933 2018-04-23 19:33:37 what i wrote earlier today. His numbers have been good, but not all goalies from the 'big ice" adapt well to the NHL. If this deal is actually true, and he pans out. I see the Oil moving on from Cam after next season. Maybe they see one of the young goalies developing this year?
1934 2018-04-23 19:33:34 a very wise lady once said #duffers @cyalm Eliminate the left,mobilise the right,re-engineer society. to maintain internal predominance; this configuration forecloses the prosperity goal.

1952 2018-04-23 19:30:40 Did they change the super m oil I remember it from the 90's and it smelled so good. But now after having some two strokes again and using it again it doesn't smell as good anymore. Thanks love maxima oils.

1970 2018-04-23 19:28:39 No.  :)   He is required to follow party policy on this one, I imagine, which is still entirely in the pocket of the oil companies and big investment funds who depend on oil money to generate shareholder profits.  Neoliberalism requires compliance "or it all falls apart".

1979 2018-04-23 19:27:31 Soaking in an epsom salt bath is a great relaxing way to get relief too.  It also  reduces swelling.  Add some lavender oil and voila....relaxation to the max!!

I think my prenatals help a lot, but I also use wild growth oil!!

1981 2018-04-23 19:27:12 In left leaning states like my own (Oregon) this kind of thinking creates laws that make an oil company hire pump attendants to fill gas. Consumers HAVE to pay the premium to give a low skilled worker a salary.
1982 2018-04-23 19:26:57 We need to leave Syria alone and worry about all the poor and starving people in America. Countries are fighting over who’s going to kill an entire nation for oil, which only destroys the Earth.

1985 2018-04-23 19:26:37 Of course the number one thing that enables the petty rivalries of oil states is oil revenues. In 10 or 20 years when EVs take over, their economies will shrink dramatically, and if they have wars at all, they will be in response to domestic collapse.

1992 2018-04-23 19:25:24 Oil is a powerful part of what unites high levels of the Trumpist crowd with Russia.

They are united in attacking the Muslim world, particularly the Arab-Muslim world

which are fellow oil producers.

So the global war on terror is a war between oil-producers.
1993 2018-04-23 19:25:20 Nah, followup would only confirm that oil companies are full of shit when they talk about their commitment to safety and to preventing and cleaning up spill.

2054 2018-04-23 19:16:44 So to change the diff oil in the Sprite I have to remove the Panhard rod to gain space. Can you guess what I need?
Male rose joints, as the races and the balls are pitted. I’m also guessing that the joints on the droplinks and quarter elliptic radius arm need replacing to. Yay...
2055 2018-04-23 19:16:37 You gonna be shocked with this we have spent on average £45m a year ! We’re always in top 4 spenders! I know crazy but true what we’ve been up against is our spending power and gate receipts both r linked! Oil money is ruining our game and keeping us out of titles!

2059 2018-04-23 19:16:13 Please do not. He mislead US in several ways, and is compromised by Russia. He failed to disclose essential information. He is deeply invested in oil an gas and stands to gain more than Rexxon.
2060 2018-04-23 19:16:10 When u go to get an oil change and they always tryna offer u extra stuff so u can pay more. I’m like nah bruh just here for a regular oil change  lol.
2061 2018-04-23 19:16:09 Oil change & a car wash 
2062 2018-04-23 19:16:03 So brought myself a fan for my room, of course I couldn’t just get a normal fan when I find a sale! Of course i buy one that has a remote control, a screen and a part to put essential oil in!

2065 2018-04-23 19:15:24 Ayyyy! So glad you like it man, and that's exactly why I love the oil - doesn't leave any horrible grease, it just soaks in and smells good :D

2067 2018-04-23 19:15:11 The government is already in massive debt, moron. In contemporary economics, the debt is virtually meaningless and actually beneficial to the extent that it ensures that oil and other commodities are traded in dollars. What does Berne's tweet have to do with spending money?
2068 2018-04-23 19:15:11 of nymphs and above was an enormous oil portrait of Bruce's parents in in a Turkish gold and topaz frame. The painting was the focal point of the room. There were wall to wall shelves filled with an envious library. There were mostly first editions as well as many antiques ~
2069 2018-04-23 19:15:05 Great news. 
You should loose the image of mountains when talking about Alaska’s north slope. The coastal plain is a barren wasteland. We should avoid the misconceptions that it is a beautiful place that needs protection from oil development.
2070 2018-04-23 19:15:05 “Fast and cheap fashion comes at a cost. It’s embarrassing to work in an industry that is second only to oil in the harm it causes. We need to come together behind a

We need to put an end to the daily lies and rants coming from the moron & his idiots in the WH. Democracy is close to needing resuscitation + lots of unity & support from America's Patriots.
2090 2018-04-23 19:12:18 Okay, there been many imperialists...
I'm worried about the actual picture, and the high US military budget that needs to be feeded every year. Also about the illegal character of last US wars, and the suspicision that its sometimes related oil and gas ressources.

2106 2018-04-23 19:10:38 super simple. brown (salted) chicken skin side down in hot olive oil, add onions, ginger, celery, carrots, parsnips. let cook a little, then add boiling water, parsley, more salt. let it cook forever, strain out all the solid stuff, put carrots, parsnips & shredded chicken back.

Another point to prove he really didn't care about Blacks. Just Chess piece on the board
2115 2018-04-23 19:09:58 You could even cook it without oil sha but the regular way Nigerians cook Jollof rice ensures it ends up garnering high amounts of sodium (from the seasonings) and high amounts of fat (from the stock & oil used in the stew). The fat could be avoided sha but the sodium gats dey.

2125 2018-04-23 19:09:00 So glad this issue is gaining more recognition. One of the saddest and most shocking things I witnessed when I lived and worked in Malaysia was the miles and miles of palm oil plantations where rainforest should be.
2126 2018-04-23 19:08:58 CBD oil, cold showers, working out.
2127 2018-04-23 19:08:57 When oil prices are good, companies spend money. They hire, or at least they don't fire. They give raises and bonuses. How much did the layoffs of 2015 and 2016 cost the governments of AB and Canada in income tax alone, to say nothing of EI, stress medical, etc?
2128 2018-04-23 19:08:53 @eddietemple1471 thinks SS has OGA approval already too.
It will be great to see the rig and start to see your pictures of things progressing. I can't wait to see the first tanker, that will be brilliant.

2130 2018-04-23 19:08:29 A lot of those statements are wrong. 
The capacity is already there. It’s going via rail.
The oil is no more or less polluting than others. It’s a blend and performs like blends. 
Energy input is way down.  And with it being in Canada it also pays a carbon tax.
2131 2018-04-23 19:08:17 what happens if everyone keeps adding to their over-levered long oil positions?
2132 2018-04-23 19:08:15 I haven’t been short except a couple of names and have been long EM (India, Iran, Nigeria, Morocco). Been flat bonds but am now long. Was flat dollars but am now long. No position in oil yet except short XOM.  Am waiting to short Google.

2138 2018-04-23 19:07:29 That's good. But why not KE is not running their plants on furnace oil as they are charging on that basis. And one more request to CM for playing his role in minimizing duty rate on solar panel and accessories.
2139 2018-04-23 19:07:28 Also I started taking Black Seed Oil-- and I can smell flowers without sneezing.
2140 2018-04-23 19:07:22 You mean like western countries manipulating South American and Middle Eastern countries for oil and drugs? Perhaps installing puppet governments and assassinating legitimate leaders? I wonder what that would look like, yeah
2141 2018-04-23 19:07:11 Good God.  You sell free crap and people buy that garbage.  Nothing is free and you damn well know it.  Want to go to college? You pay.

2152 2018-04-23 19:06:04 Coconut oil might work too! If not, there’s a special hair color remover you can get at a Sally’s Beauty Supply—Roux, I think?
2153 2018-04-23 19:06:01 Anything else good to throw in a marinade for grilled shrimp besides some lime, olive oil and salt?

2156 2018-04-23 19:05:27 I have no idea but their bill for oil paint must have been/be huge
2157 2018-04-23 19:05:16 We love this idea. Add it to moisturizer too to boost hydration. RT @caraleydon: Mixing jojoba oil in with my conditioner is the best thing I’ve done for my hair
2158 2018-04-23 19:05:12 You can mix the tea tree with any other oil if you like but I find coconut oil to be light and breathable. Also don’t recommend this if your skin is severely broken or raw because it will burn.
2159 2018-04-23 19:05:00 Yeah. Texas takes a lot of damage from man made disasters like climate change, oil spills, carcinogens, etc. They also have great land for solar and wind. So ultimately I think Texas will some day take the lead in change.
2160 2018-04-23 19:04:57 The Federal government of Nigeria should encourage local content in the oil industry. The fastest way to achieve this is to implement the content of the act of the premier Petroleum University in Nigeria and indeed Africa; 6th in the world

2178 2018-04-23 19:03:13 You are missing my point. 

The main benefit to TM would be increasing the transportation capacity for Canadian oil, increasing the pricing, and thus increasing the profits, taxes, capex for all.

2191 2018-04-23 19:01:41 Fam I drove from Maryland to Chicago cos them mofos said oil change was going to be like $600. I just put my car in the hands of the lord and drove with my prayer Goya oil and bible reciting psalms as I was driving  to guide me.

2196 2018-04-23 19:01:15 For the love of god don't go to a big chain place, they overcharge like hell. If unable to do your own, look around for a reputable local garage (Google for reviews of them), most I've been to you can get a high mileage oil change from sub $30
2197 2018-04-23 19:00:52 Until it’s built. Once it’s done, those workers aren’t needed. Oil sands production increased steadily since 2014 but the jobs decreased. Human capital is short-lived now.

2206 2018-04-23 19:00:19 No one believes in a inverted yield curve when PMI data fades toward the end of the year as oil prices fall back in December
2207 2018-04-23 19:00:08 I made a whisper that just says "piss" with an oil spill background and I get 50+ messages after I wake up from a nap

2210 2018-04-23 18:59:54 Anyone who has been in oil for any amount of time has probably been keeping an eye on this one - ever since DANA was sold, to see what Tom did next!
2211 2018-04-23 18:59:47 Yeah winning  

Let's talk about gas and heating oil prices that were way down when 44 was pres. Now we have white trash in the white house. Let's also talk about those tariffs that are costing us thousands of $$. Or all the innocent lives lost in Syria thanks to 45.
2212 2018-04-23 18:59:45 So my skin is splotchy red (with some dry patches) but also OIL AF! Is it going to make my skin super slick?

2214 2018-04-23 18:59:33 OK did anyone go to jail? It is against the law to spill oil like that and @RachelNotley promised it wouldn't happen. Lock her up! with all the BC protesters that she had arrested.

2226 2018-04-23 18:58:50 Thanks for the info on Black pepper Oil.  Stingy nettle tea with a pinch of comfrey (boneset) helps too.
2227 2018-04-23 18:58:48 Putin looked most amenable to cooperation when Russia was broke. Rise in oil prices helped to solve everything
2228 2018-04-23 18:58:30 Aways back, everything was scented with eucalyptus oil, especially dried flowers. Took me years to figure out where the headaches came from. Thankfully, the scenters have moved on. Now everything smells like there’s a musk ox in the next room, but—no headaches.

2230 2018-04-23 18:58:23 CBD oil can cure vomiting and nausea, the non-psychotropic components of this oil activates certain autoreceptors causing antiemetic/anti-nausea effects in the body. #CBDoil #pharmaceuticalscantdothat
2231 2018-04-23 18:58:16 “The Alberta government is losing $7.2 billion a year in oil revenues due to a lack of pipeline capacity and access to markets for heavy oil, a report released Tuesday by the University of Calgary said.

The government loses about $6.60 on every barrel of heavy oil exported...”
2232 2018-04-23 18:58:15 Enjoyment of the food you eat has a decent effect on how well you absorb nutrients. & if you don't like the food you won't contimue to eat it! Roast with olive oil or make those weird mashed potato substitutes cause if you don't enjoy the healthy food you eat it does you no good.
2233 2018-04-23 18:58:13 it’s coconut oil sznnnnn 
2234 2018-04-23 18:58:07 Not to mention I got an oil change to do this week 
2235 2018-04-23 18:58:03 Stop nominating unqualified people and maybe you will get your nominees approved. Stop pupping family members and cronies who abuse tax payers’ funds and trust .....Pruitt ring a bell....thief liar and incompetent and in oil companies’ pockets - he’s just one of many.
2236 2018-04-23 18:58:00 I don't even use anything but pure coconut oil on my face. I stopped getting black heads and pimples when I stopped using soap n whatever else

2239 2018-04-23 18:57:30 BC's oil prices will still drop a ton after the pipeline goes through, plus opening up a market in asia where they have no climate laws would be a good thing. They will use cleaner oil then the ones they use now.
2240 2018-04-23 18:57:27 Lemme know when the chorro hits & you explode from their peanut oil 
2241 2018-04-23 18:57:24 I support this sign. All places of work should be scent free.  I'd go a step further and add that Patchouli oil was used to cover the stench of the dead and it should never be worn in public. It's offensive.
2242 2018-04-23 18:57:21 I make my own cream and lotion.  For the cream, rubbed on feet and other body parts, I add lavender essential oil.  It has been used as a remedy even for children rubbed on feet as a soporific.
2243 2018-04-23 18:57:18 #oil teasing despite #usd being at a better point to last week .. what's the best deal? no one knows! though they all participate

2245 2018-04-23 18:57:15 Name one Holy politician. Politics and Holliness it's like water and oil my bro
2246 2018-04-23 18:57:14 @YorkshireSlang My Nan always had the best sayings... Manners, pigs, eh, non. It's in coil oil..
2247 2018-04-23 18:57:09 I just know they leak oil as opposed to shedding which sounds worse imo.
2248 2018-04-23 18:57:07 glad people made money on their gambles today, its what we do right?
but 90-10 long on oil? thats just sillyness

2250 2018-04-23 18:56:46 There's nothing wrong w her I just hate when she says conseler and all instead of oil
2251 2018-04-23 18:56:43 @ServicingStop Hey! Great service for most of it however I was charged more for oil than I was quoted for, I've not received the £10 for the review I gave, and I've had no response from two emails! What's up with that @ServicingStop
2252 2018-04-23 18:56:37 I’m telllling y’all USE baby oil instead of lotion for your body! Especiallyyyyy in the summer! Sleeping on me 
2253 2018-04-23 18:56:35 Hey Tanya, yes, our soaps are indeed septic safe. A few years back, we actually had our soaps tested for the sake of people with grey water systems. Our soaps are natural oil based, saponified by Sodium Hydroxide. -Stacey
2254 2018-04-23 18:56:32 I love baby oil
2255 2018-04-23 18:56:26 Today is a good day to use essential oil Tea Tree.  Todays message is take a step back and look at what challenges us. Allow the problem to unravel and allow a solution to come forward. Action must be done as quickly on whatever solution is offered to you.
2256 2018-04-23 18:56:15 @Oil_Pal I must have a miracle heating system as your monitoring equipment shows that I haven't used a drop of oil in four months. In fact your system has not monitored anything in my 6 months of ownership despite numerous calls and emails. Maybe now you should make a refund?!
2257 2018-04-23 18:56:14 Will look even nicer with some Osmo oil to bring out the depth of the grain 
2258 2018-04-23 18:56:14 Honestly, this coffee tastes like gear oil.
2259 2018-04-23 18:56:12 Feels like trouble is brewing in markets with a potential sharp, ugly dollar rally and massive over-positioning - short bonds, long stocks, long EM, short dollars, long oil. Every position is amongst the largest ever recorded. Vol is cheap. Google earnings better beat...
2260 2018-04-23 18:55:55 In pain? CBD Oil relieves pain by disrupting the activity of pain receptors in the body and helping in releasing serotonin and dopamine #pharmaceuticalscantdothat
2261 2018-04-23 18:55:54 For eczema, tea tree & coconut oil mix at bedtime will help alleviate the itch and heal the skin. Tea tree has antifungal properties and coconut oil helps renew + repair the damaged skin.
2262 2018-04-23 18:55:53 For healthy shiny hair use a hot oil treatment once a week.
2263 2018-04-23 18:55:53 To firm breasts and tighten the skin, mix one teaspoon of vitamin E oil with one tablespoon of yogurt and an egg.
2264 2018-04-23 18:55:51 my cousin has a Mercedes & said her oil changes are a few hundred dollars
2265 2018-04-23 18:55:38 Waiting on an oil change is probably the most boring thing ever
2266 2018-04-23 18:55:37 I remember tweeting you all, when you first came in to power, all snazzied up for the big State dinner at the Whitehouse. I was so proud!

2276 2018-04-23 18:54:10 Luckily, I haven't had a repair over 3k since 2011 and I keep the oil changed and fluids good. I'm riding that bitch until one of us dies.
2277 2018-04-23 18:54:07 For healthy shiny hair use a hot oil treatment once a week.
2278 2018-04-23 18:54:00 Today in lab was working on my unknown bug and I gram stained it and it comes out negative so I try to find it under microscope in oil but couldn’t find it so did another gram stain and it came back positive
2279 2018-04-23 18:53:55 What a day. Had to change the tires on the lawnmower, damn bolts were tight as hell and rusted. Huge pain in the ass to loosen them. Then do all the other shit, go empty the oil and replace the spark plug, then all the edging and cutting. Bring winter back please #MondayMotivatio

2282 2018-04-23 18:53:25 Except oil bulls. What do you think of that BS reversal today?
2283 2018-04-23 18:53:12 It comes in oil form for use as a massaging agent on sore muscles, arthritis, etc.
2284 2018-04-23 18:52:56 Please make sure Julian is taking vitamin D supplements since he cannot be getting any sunlight. Fish oil capsules would be good.
2285 2018-04-23 18:52:54 I’ve been exfoliating full crops since winter, I’ve been a home body since winter, the minute my ebony skin gets Canadian sun-kissed with Neutrogena sunscreen spf 115 and raspberry seed oil massaged all over? it’s game over....
2286 2018-04-23 18:52:54 My ball bearing went down the drain in the oil bath.  And I bit my tongue.
2287 2018-04-23 18:52:49 They aren’t going to get $100 a barrel oil.They need to accept that.Russia’s economy is oil dependent.Between hurting the oligarchs personal finances and keeping the per barrel price of oil down how can anyone say Trump isn’t seriously sanctioning?
2288 2018-04-23 18:52:46 Not for money. Not for oil!
2289 2018-04-23 18:52:22 Comedy doesn't have to be elaborate to reach people. It's the same as doodles and full blown oil paintings being on different levels of art. An artist can do both at any given time and be considered a good artist.
2290 2018-04-23 18:52:21 Huh? @iaeaorg inspects 24/7 and the money was Iran’s own oil revenues
2291 2018-04-23 18:52:18 Sitting getting an oil change for my car and I see why humans are so dumb, have you ever watched day time tv?! This shit is aweful!
2292 2018-04-23 18:52:07 1. Finity - Gold and Oil are controlled by “taps”, its an infinite finite. BTC is not; changes the psyche.
2. Ubiquity - In terms of transactional reach, BTC adds anybody to anywhere-anytime.
3. Velocity - BTC is the only commodity on Earth that has a higher velocity than money.
2293 2018-04-23 18:52:06 Stubbs: After you killed Gateway, Energy East, and PNW, the sector is in desparate shape. Investment in energy is predicted to drop to zero. When will Justin stop attacking oil & gas?

Carr: Justin will continue to attack oil & gas until it stops winning him votes.

2294 2018-04-23 18:52:01 Simply on grounds of population adding to environmental destruction and carbon consumption ( every Australian consumes over 7 tonnes of oil each year) - he’s right @abcnews
2295 2018-04-23 18:51:50 Lol,not patience,that's what you have residents for! I remember when I was a resident the consultant would first check the slide for oil, then ask if I found anything(without much enthusiasm) and then he would find it on 40x! and I'm like "it's my microscope"
2296 2018-04-23 18:51:46 Starting to wonder if two of the wise men were there for Jesus or if they were just trying to get Mary in on their MLM essential oil business.

2300 2018-04-23 18:51:21 US dollar highest level of the year, $EURUSD getting kicked in the nuts, and oil rallies.  Spot the oddity!
2301 2018-04-23 18:51:14 KM would make pipeline tariffs and fees. Canadian oil producers would realize higher prices from the transportation capacity increase, and governments would see more tax revenues. Fewer layoffs in the sector, too.
2302 2018-04-23 18:51:12 When do we want it?
2303 2018-04-23 18:51:00 Big mistake using a tanning oil with no guide colour, who knows what I'll look like in 8 hours

More oil means price will go lower not higher.

2308 2018-04-23 18:50:08 This rates up there with Trump saying the gross national product is below zero. He makes this shit up as he goes. Stop encouraging him.  Are you one of the 4,000,000? An extra 20 bucks in my paycheck doesn't count as "bigger", and oil prices are soring. What country are you in?

2326 2018-04-23 18:47:55 @BenEisen: "A continued rise in oil prices could eventually force the Federal Reserve to lift rates faster to clamp down on spiraling inflation"

No. That's not how the Fed's reaction function works.

2337 2018-04-23 18:45:35 There’s not a single oil pipeline that flows from Calgary, Alberta’s richest city and home to TransAlta, who operates all of Canada’s largest wind farms. Chill. It’s all good. The USA will fill global markets needs, if we don’t. They’ll do it with with offshore drilling, though.

2366 2018-04-23 18:42:42 I think you have a point. Corporate, political and group virtue signalling is one of the main underlying causes of the marketing campaign against Canadian oil. Saudi oil and Venezuelan is fine, Canadian is somehow bad. #ableg #cdnpoli

2399 2018-04-23 18:38:40 Interesting analysis, I'd tack up most of the current high prices to global trade and freight movements (tied to economic growth). IMO will likely indeed boost ULSD, but probably not until 2020 when the refining system will need to divert distillate into fuel oil pool

2436 2018-04-23 18:33:34 And this argument is flawed. Are you more or less comfortable with Canadian safety standards or middle eastern? A drop of oil in their ocean is no worse for the global oceans than one in Burnaby, in fact ocean currents could carry it there. Why not optimize a responsible source?

2439 2018-04-23 18:33:17 More rig additions in the Permian, driven by bullish oil prices, bode well for associated gas growth this year. Although this production increase is a bearish development for #naturalgas, pipeline bottlenecks may limit how much reaches the market, easing downward price pressure.

2475 2018-04-23 18:29:10 I think one additional value of Record + Playback (I agree it seems like snake oil) is it is easy for making proof of concepts. If you can use it in a very limited way to show the value of automating a feature or particular set of features, you can then invest more later.

2493 2018-04-23 18:26:01 This potent mix of *geopolitical risks* has been the main driver behind the *upward move in oil prices* in the last two weeks.
2494 2018-04-23 18:25:59 *Key geopolitical risks*

Many in the oil markets assume *oil sanctions will snap back on Iran on 12 May*

There are also se rious concerns about *continue d steep production declines in Venezuela*

*The possibility of oil sanctions against Venezuela after elections on 20 May*.

2517 2018-04-23 18:23:20 Yet we have a PM that supports Islamic oil and Islamic culture, denies the huge pollution caused by countries who do nothing! while destroying our Industries  to make a political statement that does nothing! No effect on global pollution/carbon, approves St Lawrence sewage?
2518 2018-04-23 18:23:19 That should work for me as well. Getting my oil changed at 6 so should be good to go

2529 2018-04-23 18:21:52 Really odd how oil has doubled in price since 2014 and you say Scotland's economy is in bad shape. How do you explain that?

2533 2018-04-23 18:21:23 I disagree. Coconut oil may not be that bad compared to other saturated fats but it is still bad compared to healthier food stuffs. Coconut oil has also been used to impair artery function and impair anti-inflammatory mechanisms. I agree with the Institute of Medicine.

2542 2018-04-23 18:20:11 I wonder why @JSE_Group is no longer tweeting the closing R/$ exchange rate, the Brent oil price and the up and down movements of certain share groups. They used to tweet this information every week day after %pm.

2550 2018-04-23 18:19:36 The transition you speak of will be quicker if KM is not built. Demand is controlled by supply as much is supply is controlled by demand. Flood the market with new supply-demand goes up. Keep oil in the ground, demand for renewable energy goes up. #cdnpoli

2564 2018-04-23 18:18:24 just some useful info: coconut oil is the BEST makeup remover and literally using it has also made my eyelashes and skin better - granted i wouldn’t reccomend it as a face moisturizer but leaving it on/rubbing it in and then washing off the excess has been IT for me

2573 2018-04-23 18:17:37 the leading thought right now is oil starvation resulted in a spun bearing. Only fix would be totally rebuilding the engine which is not worth it. It'll be salvaged for parts
2574 2018-04-23 18:17:23 I buy whatever the white mayo looking stuff is at Aldi and use it in the three dishes I make each year. I think we barely use it up before the oil in it goes rancid (yes, we keep it in the fridge it just lasts forever).

2590 2018-04-23 18:16:07 I dropped it in the middle and it floated that way. I did two more pieces and they floated too. I just watched a video on it and it made sense. I always wondered why oil sat on my hair. It makes sense now
2591 2018-04-23 18:16:04 dabin probably use coconut oil conditioner that’s why his hair is so greasy
2592 2018-04-23 18:15:54 Put a little bit of peppermint oil on your wrist. I’ve noticed that helps or there’s a lot of different essential oil combinations that you can find on the internet’s that might help. Migraines suck so I am sorry your dealing with that
2593 2018-04-23 18:15:54 What if #LasVegas incident was part of the Saudi coup? What if a certain powerful Prince had Saudi military for protection? What if hired mercenaries tried to capture?

2597 2018-04-23 18:15:40 Thanks for posting this fascinating article. And I think it makes an interesting point about how the decline of the ME as a oil supplier to the US has lessened America's need to have peace and stability there. That would explain Qatar.

2599 2018-04-23 18:15:30 Reading this article ticks me off to no end as certain politicians go around thumping their chests in defense of the oil industry while this is the reality  on the ground...

2602 2018-04-23 18:15:02 Yes, we don't need another Angola fiasco...IMO we should focus on the fishery as PL with its coast is blessed with fishery and we could get far with that alone, save the Oil for later.

2605 2018-04-23 18:14:39 Real cold pressed carrier oils are comedogenic and don’t break you out. It’s still oil but it won’t clog your pores.
2606 2018-04-23 18:14:35 My dad (very devout Christian) suffered with Leukemia for 9 months. Prayed every day and studied the bible and never complained once. Our pastor at the time even did “oil anointing” in the hospital and he still died in his early 50s. I get the sentiment but it’s trite.

Here in the south, there's a debate as to which mayo they prefer. 3 main mayo are Miracle Whip, Duke's & Hellmann's.

That blll is directed straight at Alberta. To stop energy development. There's a major push here to shutdown Canada's Oil industry. Soda ban Bloomberg told a conference with Canada's enviro minister in attendance that banks shouldn't lnvest in Alberta oil anymore.

2728 2018-04-23 17:58:49 Well if you actually researched the Iran Deal, you would you understand that the money we gave them was actually money we took and if you knew history you would now that Reagan and the CIA supported the Ayatollah a dictator by the way just because he gave us oil.
2729 2018-04-23 17:58:45 CONDITIONER! and if I want it to be SUPER defined I used grapeseed oil AND a conditioner. But I don't like using gel unless I'm going to work (I have to wear buns- military)
2730 2018-04-23 17:58:41 My hands are smelly though... Full of oil and grease
2731 2018-04-23 17:58:19 Getting oil changed and tires rusted that @wayscarffford
2732 2018-04-23 17:58:10 Toss it with a little olive oil and garlic and lemon juice and salt then roast it in the oven and it tastes fucking amazing
2733 2018-04-23 17:58:05 It was a decision made by higher-ups and marketing got its marching orders (and I promise you-they didn’t all agree).
2734 2018-04-23 17:57:50 技術流出はどの業種も気を付けなきゃいけない事だけど、それを最近は多くの人がやってるなぁって思っちゃう
どれがアニメ業界内でのノウハウなのかは分かりにくいけど
段々とｱﾆﾒｰﾀｰにならなくてもｱﾆﾒｰﾀｰのノウハウが全部知れちゃいそう、そうなると技術職って言えなくなるのでは
2735 2018-04-23 17:57:46 Creamy baby oil or baby oil gel, I’ve heard other moms use this
2736 2018-04-23 17:57:46 Dan That is what Soros told him what to say ... remember Schiff is nothing but a paid puppet of theNWO
2737 2018-04-23 17:57:32 Getting my car’s oil changed for the first time in my life. Never been more out of place

2742 2018-04-23 17:56:53 Poverty is the weapon of mass destruction in a country like South Sudan.  The citizens are kept in dark as elites go on a rampant purge to loot oil money & do illegal gold mining for self gains.
2743 2018-04-23 17:56:50 doors open+windows open+oil painting = no fumes and also pretty nice
2744 2018-04-23 17:56:50 Gotta get my oil changed soooon
2745 2018-04-23 17:56:37 @elonmusk can you make sure you buy the patent that breaks down plastic,secreted by insects,before the oil companies do
2746 2018-04-23 17:56:26 As you state we "don't have humanitarian aims," but we do have an unquenchable thirst for oil, profit, geopolitical dominance, desire to keep defense contractors (merchants of death) rich + salivating, etc., U.S. bombs poor brown people for profit; always have.
2747 2018-04-23 17:56:25 But Saudi Arabia airport has more flights abd handles more people than JKIA,it’s a business hub.The MBS is trying to diversify their economy not to be oil dependent.
2748 2018-04-23 17:56:15 That's why I fear for him. Considering the vile nature of the ecosystem, it won't mind from conducting a Sanjay Gandhi part 2 & install Priyanka Gandhi. In the next 10 mths, anything shit happened like oil price rise, Kandahar2,etc, then the ecosystem will be back with vengeance.
2749 2018-04-23 17:55:50 ugh i need an  oil change... bleh.. being an adult is so expensive.. i wish i  could be a  kid again...

2752 2018-04-23 17:55:27 The problems in oil are a Canadian made Problem! Governments and business that receive funding from outside influences! Soros and tides, environmental groups funded by American billionaires  that hold railroads, tankers etc! Buffet owns railroads he was Obama’s big supporter!
2753 2018-04-23 17:54:46 nomas busca bp oil spill
2754 2018-04-23 17:54:37 Was it stuck on the side of the cup though? Lol if not some of your best oils are light oils like, grapeseed oil, avocado oil,sweet almond etc. we don’t really like olive oil or coconut. But everyone is different! So trial & error
2755 2018-04-23 17:54:21 I think it’s time for an oil change
2756 2018-04-23 17:54:00 How about all the subsidies we give to the oil industry to influence Human behavior? I’d rather have this which actually helps our planet than what republicans do constantly which is give corporate handouts to the biggest oil companies.
2757 2018-04-23 17:53:50 .@TruthGundlach : His call was for long oil and short Facebook. He said commodity inflation is common before recessions and that regulation can end bull markets, like Facebook. @ForexLive #OOTT $FB
2758 2018-04-23 17:53:44 Oilers won a round last year. Excluding '06 the Oil and Flames both have just one round win in that time.

2763 2018-04-23 17:53:00 Busy week ahead, locking down the next release of our Asset Management product for demo and training to our Oil and Gas sector client. Used mostly to manage and inspect RFID tagged assets in Atex rated zones, but has applications in many industries.
2764 2018-04-23 17:52:42 To those of you who didn't know - France was one of the countries who pushed for the Libyan War to protect their rule over the Francophone African countries (which is why we have the current refugee crisis) because of their oil reserves and the gold dinar. #Libya #Gaddafi #Obama
2765 2018-04-23 17:52:26 *splashes anointing oil. Allah ya shirye ki
2766 2018-04-23 17:52:17 One side values hard work and rewards it.   The other worries about the religious leanings of a chicken sandwich....Which one would you pick?
2767 2018-04-23 17:52:14 We bought the extended warranty with my wife's BMW. Just today she took it in because oil seems to be seeping either into the combustion chamber or the turbo. This makes it BMW's problem, not mine.
2768 2018-04-23 17:52:10 Man I should take more Mondays off. Oil change and grocery shopping done in less than an hour.
2769 2018-04-23 17:51:59 Infuse 3 cups olive oil with 1 ounce ground up & decarboxilated cannabis that has 15% THC. Each Tablespoon of oil will have 87mg THC. So, in a loaf of banana bread, each of 10 slices will have 8.7mg THC which is a low-dose, mellow bit of pain relief. For me, the end of migraines!
2770 2018-04-23 17:51:37 Nooo oil, if you’re acne prone oils won’t help. I tried tea tree oil & it just made my skin work. I’m currently using birth control but my skin is cystically  broken out so it’s gonna take a while to heal. Use like a gentle non stripping face wash. Currently using cerve
2771 2018-04-23 17:51:26 Yes I do  fry them gently with the potatoes in olive oil
2772 2018-04-23 17:51:24 they are the children of big oil
and they don't give a fuck about
you peasants.
2773 2018-04-23 17:51:18 Mmanu = oil
Ofe = soup.
2774 2018-04-23 17:51:16 Like the oilers and the oil kings strategy
2775 2018-04-23 17:51:11 No one will explain how turning the taps can actually happen.  Oil producers halt production or the oil is shipped somewhere else by rail or by truck?  It just can't be that simple.
2776 2018-04-23 17:50:53 It sounds like some NYC nigga shit wearing timbs in the summer.... gotta oil then ankles up cause they out.
2777 2018-04-23 17:50:53 Absolutely. Most so called "Italian" olive oil is in fact either 100% Spanish or is blended with Spanish oil.

Spanish producers are letting down the nation by their lack of foresight & unwilliingess to invest in their brands. 

It is all "Cash now" mentality.
2778 2018-04-23 17:50:50 Why would you pick losers?
If companies are rewarded for green innovation our dependence on fossil fuels will reduce naturally. Taxation won't lessen our dependence, right now, on oil.
2779 2018-04-23 17:50:48 You pull up to jiffy lube wanting an oil change and I swear niggas come from everywhere lmao
2780 2018-04-23 17:50:47 I also have CSP, but try downloading the FLAT OIL brush! It works a lot better!
2781 2018-04-23 17:50:13 Absolute win. You get to skip out on at least one oil change with how much you drive too
2782 2018-04-23 17:50:02 Zero-emissions vehicles are the future, especially electric bikes in cities.  Meanwhile, making it "fair" for people to burn gas is not in anyone's best interest except big oil.  We can tax tires too, but why bother until people stop burning gasoline?
2783 2018-04-23 17:49:59 No they see us as an easy conquest and a gateway to the states! Easy borders work both ways! Foreign Oil in the east may be pushed by Saudis and others but it is corrupt business and politicians in bed with each other that enable it and keep that insanity alive! Greed! Fuels all!
2784 2018-04-23 17:49:42 何て言うか、アニメの作り方は表に沢山出して行くべきだと思うけど、プロのｱﾆﾒｰﾀｰとしてのノウハウや技術は曖昧にして出すべきじゃないのかな…ってたまに思う
何を…？って言われても上手く説明できないけど
2785 2018-04-23 17:49:37 Astonishing how the van Eycks pretty much nailed oil painting in the same way that Gutenberg nailed book production - fresh out of the box.

2787 2018-04-23 17:49:11 John I appreciate the clarification, but please explain how 'using huge amounts of energy to achieve.. clean water & unpolluted land' can be done without the pollution of coal & oil energy and why you think wind and solar energy are 'fake'; I;d like to know more about your views.
2788 2018-04-23 17:48:49 My new tattoo is finally healed & the only thing I used on it was coconut oil.

2790 2018-04-23 17:48:36 Entire body. Mixed with oil.
2791 2018-04-23 17:48:23 Gundlach… A fixed income guy says investors should short $FB and go long oil….. ah mijo…

seriously, don’t do it… short $FB that is...
2792 2018-04-23 17:48:15 Think you should probably ask Mormans that question first! Lol

2796 2018-04-23 17:47:46 I hopped on the #CBD oil train. So far I love it. Haven’t had any arthritis pain since Thursday...when I started it.
2797 2018-04-23 17:47:45 Oil dey your head
2798 2018-04-23 17:47:37 the fact that all my hair products are finishing at the same time hurts from the inside out my shampoo and conditioner ,  leave in conditioner , cream, oil everything  and they expense asf
2799 2018-04-23 17:47:21 Finishing just outside play-offs and having the leagues highest goal scorer and assist maker, all with awful average attendance figures is still a good season for Posh. I get your point, but let's not forget we're not owned by an oil baron with gates of 10k+

2805 2018-04-23 17:46:53 Er, because they're Dicks?
2806 2018-04-23 17:46:39 There's nothing radical about drilling for oil to make us free from dependency on foreign oil.  We have too many resources here to be at the mercy of any foreign gov't., and why make their countries rich instead of ours! Obama choked off these resources! Shame on him!

2808 2018-04-23 17:46:32 The argument isn't that we don't need a UBI it's that you can't promise people a check that satisfies basic living standards without a theory of who will do the work. We are all for more $$ for poor people, even aside from JG we just won't sell snake oil.
2809 2018-04-23 17:46:26 It’s facts. That’s how the club earns money now and our owners own mulitple clubs. The Owners haven’t spent oil money since 2011. That’s facts. So stop talking shite

2815 2018-04-23 17:45:34 Any of my oily friends have an extra RC oil I can get off ya?
2816 2018-04-23 17:45:33 “I’ve always had sensitive and dry skin. This oil has improved my skin quality and made my skin glow." If you have always been nervous to try products because of your sensitive skin, look no further. #AuraSilk is the product for you, just as one of our customers Jenni found out!

2824 2018-04-23 17:44:09 You see, we had a very irresponsible government in PDP who made sure that the whole system was adequately corrupted.
And do you know that any attempt to cancel that official madness would end in endless bombing of oil facilities?
2825 2018-04-23 17:44:01 Do birth control pills cause/cure acne? Birth control pills may help some women control acne. The hormones in birth control pills can help block androgen hormones. Androgen puts oil glands into overdrive. Even if u take birth control pills, you'll still need a skincare routine.

2833 2018-04-23 17:43:18 Either Modi will be forced to increase Petrol prices ~ 100-105 per litre with oil ~ $83 or Rupee will be hit in anticipation of rising deficit. That should lead to rising inflation and rising interest rates to support rupee.

High rates generally mean falling Economic activity.

2846 2018-04-23 17:42:11 As far as can see you are not comprehending that the vehicles in the picture are all commercial.

Corruption is killing Kenya's economy from Dangotes deal to the failed oil pipeline from Uganda where politicians started buying land along the proposed route once they had the plans
2847 2018-04-23 17:42:10 I keep wondering just where is this phantom market for dilbit. The new terminal in the Gulf will supply the foreseeable oil market, and at less cost.
2848 2018-04-23 17:42:08 You can’t mix oil and water it won’t work as well, definitely mix the oil with a healthy all natural leave in conditioner and boiled water
2849 2018-04-23 17:42:07 I had peppermint oil on my fingers, forgot to wash my hands, & then put my contacts in. My eyeballs froze over and felt like literal ice

2852 2018-04-23 17:41:23 Sometimes it astounds me that I live in an age when I can make an appointment to get my car's oil changed completely online and text my hairdresser to see when I can come in for a trim
2853 2018-04-23 17:41:15 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
2854 2018-04-23 17:41:09 I would say 50% of it, mainland oil is not even the most impressive thing. There's more even offshore both Gas and Oil outside of Cape Guardafui and other areas of Puntland.

2856 2018-04-23 17:40:59 I think it's painfully apparent the parents don't have the child's best interests at heart. Dragging a gravely ill child around the world for some snake oil 'cure' is selfish.

2859 2018-04-23 17:40:50 Now please be one of the leaders in the race to divest in oil.  By their own admissions responsible for our current climate crisis.

2865 2018-04-23 17:40:27 Castor oil has my hair flourishinggggggg yusss
2866 2018-04-23 17:40:26 Is it an oil? 
2867 2018-04-23 17:40:23 ah well these are made with coconut oil so maybe they’re actually better than most
2868 2018-04-23 17:40:23 Is that the CBD oil? Been looking for a cheaper but good source than the one I have been using.
2869 2018-04-23 17:40:22 @hcmariwala is Marico offering cold pressed coconut oil? If not pl do consider it.

Started using it recently . It is a brilliant skin care product . 

What Parachute is to haircare this can be for skin care.
2870 2018-04-23 17:40:19 What? You are living in another world, your money comes from oil not from the money you make from football itself, i don't know if you are from Manchester but its easy to jump to the hype train...
2871 2018-04-23 17:40:18 Yes. He lives within his legitimate means. Unlike other corrupt past leaders that enrich themselves by looting and stealing our resources. As a former min of petroleum, doesn't not surprise you that he has no oil wells.
2872 2018-04-23 17:40:15 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
2873 2018-04-23 17:40:09 When we start producing oil we will do the same.

2875 2018-04-23 17:40:05 Native Americans are the strongest people alive.
We bullied them into reserves and then found out that the biggest oil deposit in the world is under the Black Hills; their sacred land.
So we’ve been bullying them to get to that the last few years but they say fuck all. 
2876 2018-04-23 17:39:56 And you're just now figuring this out...
2877 2018-04-23 17:39:53 It's very sad and absolutely Not okay for us to eradicate an entire species from exsistance. We need to TOTALLY STOP DESTROYING OUR PLANET and  the lives of the Animals,  Birds Creatures big and small living in it. We have NO RIGHT, We need to stop using Fossil Fuels, Gas,  Oil
2878 2018-04-23 17:39:50 Thanks to @zacho_16 @westonpeick Danny from @MaximaOils (we're going to get some oil questions answered) @AEnticknap722 & @KKeefer120 for coming on the show

2880 2018-04-23 17:39:27 “The truth may be stretched thin, but it never breaks, and it always surfaces above lies, as oil floats on water.” - Miguel de Cervantes y Saavedra (~1547 - 1616)
2881 2018-04-23 17:39:22 Don’t leave out back to dirty air and water, no consequences for oil spills and pollution, segregation, and a Cold War.

2883 2018-04-23 17:38:59 That's not what your sebum says as it produces excess oil to make up for your dryness
2884 2018-04-23 17:38:51 Apple cider vinegar on a wet face cloth, dap it on your sun burn then out on after sun or coconut oil. I’m a pro. This is a weekly thing 
2885 2018-04-23 17:38:47 The only essential oil is olive
2886 2018-04-23 17:38:43 it started with the silly riverdale thing.  then it got into details and how they don't align.  The KM spills of say 2/yr, A) is not 15/mil per spill a spill could be 1 bbl of oil to yes something larger but not every leak is your made up number.
2887 2018-04-23 17:38:42 Wait to hear what he says when Alberta stops shipping oil to BC.
2888 2018-04-23 17:38:37 Your tweet is a CAPITAL offense.
2889 2018-04-23 17:38:25 When @Davinci615 played that Whitney Houston and mixed that BlocBoy Jb “Shoot” with it, he made history Oil Spill  S/o to the host @EyeAmHouston
2890 2018-04-23 17:38:11 Wowowow lost 2 pounds, got an oil change, put air on my tires, early to class with my homework printed, lost 2 pounds :-)  today’s a good day

2892 2018-04-23 17:38:00 am i crying or do i have coconut oil in my eyes? it is the wind blowing too hard???? You’ll never know
2893 2018-04-23 17:37:59 Pills and Snake Oil are not the only for-profit media advertising allowed to exploit our nations' most vulnerable. What about book sales, commercial ads and campaign lies that elect Presidents???? If a ban on fake advertising was possible, who would decide what is allowed?
2894 2018-04-23 17:37:57 She's aged horribly....

2898 2018-04-23 17:37:47  the first time i made them, I was flipping them on the gas and there was a pan of oil near there. When I flipped it it landed in the oil lmao my mum went crazy
2899 2018-04-23 17:37:34 CBD oil helps, if that’s legal where you are. I have it, too.

2903 2018-04-23 17:37:12 Most times, yeah 

Candles and/or oil lanterns are always a good thing to have stashed for those times 
2904 2018-04-23 17:36:59 As I sit here at the dealer waiting for my oil change, tire rotation, state inspection, and the periodic airbag sensor alarm to be investigated I cant help but think if they put me in a brand new Ram1500 with the same payment and no money down, I jump all over it right now.
2905 2018-04-23 17:36:52 Guys is buying beard oil for someone offensive?
2906 2018-04-23 17:36:43 @SouthBucksDC Please tell me how to dispose of cooking oil that remains fluid in the fridge.
2907 2018-04-23 17:36:39 I was offended because I was once graped by a bunch of little Hampstead c*nts who smeared me in peanut oil!!

2910 2018-04-23 17:36:12 My skin is screeching which means I've probably been eating all the wrong things and stressing too much with too little sleep. Also probably using too much (any) oil.
2911 2018-04-23 17:35:48 I be forgetting I'm anointed by the oil, in the blood so nothing formed against me shall ever prosper
2912 2018-04-23 17:35:43 And Argan oil at night after shower
2913 2018-04-23 17:35:41 On God wingstop sauce ain’t shit but oil and grease with them soggy ass fries
2914 2018-04-23 17:35:21 so I just made french toast and it tastes amazing! All I used was wheat free/gluten free bread, coconut milk, walnuts, honey n coconut oil to fry it 
2915 2018-04-23 17:35:17 Kinda wanna go to the gym, but also kinda wanna cover myself in coconut oil, do a face mask and drink a bottle of wine  x
2916 2018-04-23 17:35:07 he texted through the first part of the date, then i ordered a salad with vinaigrette...turns out to have walnut oil vs olive oil. my face swells up like will smith’s in hitch and he had to drive me to the hospital. then he tried to french kiss me at the end of the night. 
2917 2018-04-23 17:35:03 The way Nigerians say  “Oil and Gas” >>>>>>>>>
2918 2018-04-23 17:34:58 Word of advice is to use eucalyptus all over your body. Should help with the welts and will keep the mosquitos away. Mix with a base oil.
2919 2018-04-23 17:34:54 @ABDanielleSmith So it's okay to ship coal in tankers from BC and bring oil tankers up the coast from The US , its okay to drill in the ocean off NS, remember the Deep Water Horizon accident in the Gulf, yet Alberta oil is always demoinized!
2920 2018-04-23 17:34:45 Gold Oil an Dollar. Ninguna de la santisima trinidad se nos permite.
2921 2018-04-23 17:34:45 If you like the smell, that’s important too. (Some people hate the smell of tea tree oil)

But yes. It’s used for similar purposes as tea tree oil; including in hair for breakage/ growth.
2922 2018-04-23 17:34:26 What does Africa and Ghana needs. Its not the Gold nor the Oil. But what Africa and Ghanan needs is huge investment and enhancement in her Human Resource, and utilize them properly.
2923 2018-04-23 17:34:21 I'm sure that she will convince Fjord she has to 'Lay on Hands' to heal him.  The massage oil is also meant to promote healing.  She can't use the oils if Fjord is still wearing all his armor and clothes so that has to go too.  Never mind that her 'healing word' is "Oh Oskjar!"
2924 2018-04-23 17:34:03 @FloydShivambu Obama will be in town, hi fanela hi mu ndzundzusha ku ri hiyeana anga dlaya Gaddafi ku ri va yiva oil a Libya.
2925 2018-04-23 17:34:00 I’ve been using Carmex and it works a little but leaves my lips feeling dry and actually worse after. I have coconut oil at home I’m gonna try that!

2928 2018-04-23 17:33:39 This is a Koch Brothers organization. Their agenda: Tax cuts for the wealthy and big oil, eliminating the minimum wage, slashing Medicare and dismantling Social Security. 
Think of this when listening.
2929 2018-04-23 17:33:32 Supply of weapons to #Ukranians. Destruction in #Syria. #Iraq #Afghanistan and many more they have used the same tools to attack and destroy countries. They just want an issue to please their allies in the gulf for their cheap oil and money. Disrespect they will cross any limit.
2930 2018-04-23 17:33:20 A little black pepper, rosemary & ginger oil - ahhh + a good masseuse!!!
2931 2018-04-23 17:33:05 Here is a point you don't see frequently mentioned. Russia's economy is hugely dependent on oil. Kill off the reliance on oil, bring down demand/prices, you impose a massive hit on the collective Russian wealth/power structure.
2932 2018-04-23 17:32:51 honestly im not sure where medieval oil came from, or whether its edible or not...
2933 2018-04-23 17:32:14 Well, that was Canola. Notice the candy thermometer in the corner. Make sure the oil is at 300 degrees. No more, no less. Let the chips stand in ice cold water for a few minutes to get the starch out. Don't crowd the pan & try to use cast iron if possible.
2934 2018-04-23 17:32:12 Norway, a leading oil exporter, to ban purebliss wafers in the logistics.
2935 2018-04-23 17:32:11 Got my oil changed for 35 dollars this morning. That’s cheaper than when I do It myself
2936 2018-04-23 17:32:00 On Friday, over 40 art pieces were submitted to the Prairieland Art Conference hosted at WIU. We took 3 ribbons home: Abbey Gilles with 2nd place in oil pastel, Logan Smith with 3rd place in Sculpture, and Maddy Halm with student choice in 3-D Design. Congrats!
2937 2018-04-23 17:32:00 OIL
2938 2018-04-23 17:31:57 I read online that lemon essential oil can help with hyperpigmentation, so I added half a drop to my nightly moisturizer last night and I can already see a minor difference. I'm impressed!
2939 2018-04-23 17:31:55 c/o @EPAScottPruitt who gutted SCIENCE & ENVIORNMENTAL PROTECTIONS from the @EPA in order to shower further Profits on His Big Oil Overlords (which he requires a soundproof booth to speak with...).
2940 2018-04-23 17:31:53 Changed eyelet bushing on my shock as it was knocking, turns out to be air in the oil, so off to  #Sprungsuspension it's gone.
2941 2018-04-23 17:31:32 People need to get educated!  CBD oil doesn’t make you high, it makes you healthy!!
2942 2018-04-23 17:31:23 Or because they accidentally touched something at a bus stop. Happened to mini and thankfully wasn't opiod, just hash oil.
2943 2018-04-23 17:31:12 @ABDanielleSmith To bring it closer to home re: oil and gas! They tell us that CO2 is killing us, if that is the case then all fossil fuel production should be immediately ceased worldwide, not going to happen!
2944 2018-04-23 17:31:03 thank you so much  i do have a skincare tips that i’m happy to share (tea tree oil for breakouts, derma-e activated charcoal moisturizer & snail mucin essence after moisturizing) but everyone’s different & tbh i just think my lifestyle hasn’t caught up w me yet 
2945 2018-04-23 17:30:52 Ima put on some body oil before I hit the gym tonight...
2946 2018-04-23 17:30:52 He doesn't and never will represent me. The trick for all of us will be how to come together as a nation after this con man and snake oil salesman has done everything he could to tear us apart? What will the Trump supporter do when they are forced back into the shadows?

2950 2018-04-23 17:30:28 If you order a "black whack" in supermax, they bring you out 4 women covered in oil and use the oil to cook your chips. You never see the girls though, but we all know it happens. Or at least now you do.
2951 2018-04-23 17:30:27 Hi Sally, our Baked chips were discontinued. Have you tried our Uprooted Sweet Potato or Almond Oil chips?
2952 2018-04-23 17:30:21 Obama can use the word, cos the Government provides JOBS,TRAINING, GRANTS FOR SCHOOL, FOOD STAMPS AND HOUSING, for those in "NEED" prior to their independence, unlike NIGERIA with the Oil MONEY, spent or LOOTED by Thor ELECTED POLITICIANS only, some states don't even pay salaries
2953 2018-04-23 17:30:14 Grab the blessed oil and start speaking in tongues, praying down salvation for our pseudo-heathen behinds lol
2954 2018-04-23 17:30:11 ใจมันคอยบอกตัวเองอยู่เสมอ ว่าเธอนั้นเป็นสุขไปแล้ว
2955 2018-04-23 17:30:11 Awesome! Thanks, Mollie! I was thinking it was you that mentioned this last year. Where do you buy these? uses a diffuser in the house. Is it just an essential oil?
2956 2018-04-23 17:30:04 We need to build water pipelines throughout the US to distribute to those places that lack water. If We can do it for oil we can do it for water. And no need to worry about leaks 
2957 2018-04-23 17:29:55 Bro ja tem malta beard growth oil na Amazon and e' free chipping. :D :D
2958 2018-04-23 17:29:40 Also Try CBD oil. It’s supposed to reduce stress which can trigger immune system to overreact and since they think stomatitis is autoimmune it might help. I just ordered & am going 2 try but Georgie is semi feral so not sure I can get it in him.  Georgie is high strung so ...
2959 2018-04-23 17:29:23 And Minnesota not quite ready to throw in the blue towel yet!
Some have us purple...but we are NOT a red state!
Let Texas secede already..trump &oil. 
This is becoming a little too real...
2960 2018-04-23 17:29:19 These so called eye creams don't work. Its a big ass scam, same WhatsApp group as Bio oil. Just putting it out there #GirlTalkZA
2961 2018-04-23 17:28:49 war is a racket! the military takes its orders from the bankers... it fights for oil and land... it fights for resources... not democracy or the people... only selfish retarded people see otherwise...
2962 2018-04-23 17:28:47 Oil field money day good cuz?
2963 2018-04-23 17:28:46 Its worse. N Afr was under Fr rule. Gadaffi wanted get rid of Fr,modernize & educate as he did Libya by having Dinar pay for oil not World Bank petro dollar. (87% educated, H2O to 80%, no taxes, free HC, jobs).After HRC, Blacks brought to educate were  made slaves or murdered
2964 2018-04-23 17:28:31 Baby prep overload: oil change, new tires, doctor, blood work, buy a “I feel guilty because we’re having a 2nd kid so we’re buying the 1st kid a police truck” giant vehicle, new contacts, & glasses (because I forgot I don’t have any), etc.    
2965 2018-04-23 17:28:27 there’s oil and acrylic paint all over my phone

2969 2018-04-23 17:28:06 Please follow my essential oil instagram account - send friends my way who may be interested in oils.. Once I start to build my team I’ll start doing giveaways and promos.  @getoilywithallib_ #younglivingessentialoils
2970 2018-04-23 17:27:56 I agree. I’m so disgusted by it we are a cancer to the earth.  deforestation. Fracking. Oil pipelines. All for shit we could replace with hemp and renewable energy. People need to adopt the new mindset their small part CAN make a change.
2971 2018-04-23 17:27:56 The AHA 30% is amazing and a dupe for the Drunk Elephant baby facial. Def get that along with the Rosehip oil and Hylaluronic acid
2972 2018-04-23 17:27:55 Eating a slice of Pizza is like swallowing 2 Table spoons of warm oil.
2973 2018-04-23 17:27:49 If i cover myself in tanning oil you think ill tan in 50° weather?
2974 2018-04-23 17:27:45 I would probably not do it while it's wet...let it dry first, atleast I do. My routine is Wash,  towel dry, apply the oil, massage it through completely,  pick my hair, put on wave cap lol then I wait a day & apply again & massage. The point is to keep the scalp saturated.
2975 2018-04-23 17:27:37 Increase royalties for all non Canadian oil/ng companies. Mandate cash deposits into a reclamation fund, that is independently managed and ethically invested in Canadian renewable energy and tech companies. Protect the present, invest the future.
2976 2018-04-23 17:27:17 You’re going to need a little extra oil in the oil paints
2977 2018-04-23 17:27:08 You're still living in the past. What was the oil price projections by the Department of Energy and Climate Change at the same time as white paper? Where are hmrc, shipbuilding jobs? We won't be in the EU. That's real not a projection
2978 2018-04-23 17:27:03 I cant use teatree oil bc i have a feathered overlord but im thinking frankincense may be an ok alternative? Thoughts?
2979 2018-04-23 17:26:39 “More than 60% of population is below 30, a lot of them haven’t been to school & they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit & do nothing & get housing, healthcare, education free ,”
2980 2018-04-23 17:25:53 Brilliant. So, law officers and officers of the court, disregard for training and years of acceptable procedures oil professional practice and just look the other way.
2981 2018-04-23 17:25:14 I always look like I was dipped in oil after bathing and using up half of my Vaseline.
2982 2018-04-23 17:25:13 @dominos_india Is is true Your Pizaa;s contains only Oil and not a single drop of real cheese ???
2983 2018-04-23 17:25:11 I agree The old adage:the squeaky wheel gets the oil.  While conservatives are self preserved well oiled machines, the liberals squeak & sqawk until they get things done for them.We need to vote those that cater to liberals out, ignore all their squeaking & continue to #MAGA.
2984 2018-04-23 17:25:04 Rose oil blend is a must to add to ur skin care soon to try the Jasmine oil blend
2985 2018-04-23 17:25:03 (warning: do not do this)
2986 2018-04-23 17:24:53 everytime i get my oil changed i walk in thinking it’ll only be $35 oil change untill the men start calling me up asking me if i want to add an oil cleanse & also a new air filter & i know nothing about cars so i just say yes and before you know it i’m walking out spending $200

2991 2018-04-23 17:24:37 nothing beats recreating the bp oil spill for a class project using rubber ducks, a mixing bowl and some oyster sauce
2992 2018-04-23 17:24:26 Bro. Bro. Brooo. But the page gave no explanation. It just said “Hack: Fill a lotion bottle with coconut oil and queeze it into your vagina”. So I assume females walking around with greasy coochies for no reason.

2994 2018-04-23 17:24:07 Wait so wash my hair, then on just my wet hair after washing take the oil, massage it into my scalp, tie it down over night?
2995 2018-04-23 17:24:06 Yeah more like " i want one of those oil/gas contracts " ill do whatever it takes
2996 2018-04-23 17:24:05 If it’s time for an oil change, don’t take too long to get it changed. It’s very hard on your vehicle if you drive around on a dirty oil filter.
2997 2018-04-23 17:23:41 Don't add them to hot oil, always put onions, garlic etc in with the oil. Then you won't burn them. Simples.
2998 2018-04-23 17:23:30 no, we won on the truth and the facts. the YES side lost on lies like currency union and set up costs of the country and false oil revenue predictions

3005 2018-04-23 17:23:03 20 yrs ago, while sorting a box of old school papers, I found a ditto paper from 4th grade (c.'77) that predicted we'd be out of oil by 1990.

Saved it. Need to dig it up & take a picture of it, so I can share it.

3019 2018-04-23 17:21:10 I wonder what the impact will be on price as China begins buying oil in Yuan, will other currencies be accepted. If your oil holdings are denominated in dollars they have no value if a run on the dollar occurs as it weakens?

3023 2018-04-23 17:20:55 Keep in mind that Oil had worse goaltending in NHL & nothing in system.  This is one single area team needs to spend. Period.  2.5 & not pucks/talent is cheap

3025 2018-04-23 17:20:38 I made it to work (barely). The drive in was a little wonky since I had trouble concentrating. Once I settled in to the stacks of paper, oil samples and emails, I am feeling better. Hoping this means I’m getting better and I’ll make it all day. I hate being sick.
3026 2018-04-23 17:20:32 & I cut ties with them! It’s not just sportsmen. It’s construction workers, Oil & Gas workers, families on vacations, ect..... This is a decision they will regret!!

3028 2018-04-23 17:19:58 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, Why is it if Russia causes trouble in the middle east the price of oil goes up and he makes lots of money.  If the oil drilled in the US stays in the US then the price for American oil will stabilize.

3031 2018-04-23 17:19:41 That's consistent with the original proposal that forecast oil rising to $200US/bbl and staying there... but never thought of what that would do to the economy generally.

3104 2018-04-23 17:11:52 Wait. Iran has been under sanctions for over 20 years. Commodity traders who bet oil prices will rise if the sanctions remain in force are just playing a low cost long shot.

If sanctions aren’t renewed, oil prices will drop. Neither the Saudis, nor the Russians, will be pleased.

Also, wells do go dry.

3213 2018-04-23 17:00:20 The oil found in UK waters belong to the UK, same as the offshore gas and onshore unconventional oil and gas, happy to clear that up for you.
3214 2018-04-23 17:00:12 Petroleum, or crude oil, forms when tiny little sea animals and plants die and then get mixed up with sand and slit on the sea floors.
3215 2018-04-23 17:00:11 There is also need to be careful with waxy sludge formed when blending a very light with a very heavy crude. This particularly fouls heat exchangers. Also shale oil contains significantly more hydrogen sulphide which needs to be scavenged out or causes massive corrosion

3270 2018-04-23 16:55:12 I don’t have to, you seem deluded in your belief that all oil surrounding Scotland isn’t Scotland’s oil 
3271 2018-04-23 16:55:08 ...i mean you're not wrong but also WHAT IF THE PAN HAS FRY OIL LEFT IN IT THAT'S STILL GOOD AND I WANNA USE IT LATER. I'M NOT JUST GONNA PUT IT IN A DRAWER. OKAY?? people do this!!!! tell me people do this lmfao!!

3273 2018-04-23 16:54:27 Dear Brick & Mortar Retailers: Want me to take my business to Amazon? Nothing will make me leave your boutique faster than your use of these asinine essential oil diffusers. I don't want to breathe this s**t or have it on what I'm buying. QUIT IT!
3274 2018-04-23 16:54:16 Have you tried cbd oil for her? My 12 year old had it and is awesome and healthy now.
3275 2018-04-23 16:54:14 Nam I use that oil just because it’s nice and rich niks kuxweba. Enye nenye niks.
3276 2018-04-23 16:54:10 Canceled my air ticket and taxi etc, as 78% crude oil (petrol) comes from Gulf countries- Why to give money to these people where the most remittances come from....
 Pyaare- Let's use "Bail Gadi" (chuk-chuk-chuk) 
Sarcasm !!
3277 2018-04-23 16:53:51 OPEC-Oil mafia controlled by Saudi Arabia bribes our politicians so we won’t complain. President Trump will force them to lower price of oil. The cost of producing oil is less than $20 a barrel. The rest is profit.

3279 2018-04-23 16:53:16 Pretty much the same as hearing a wheel bearing squeak and growl and saying a fresh oil change and tank of gas and it'll be OK, then blaming the engine when the wheel falls off.
3280 2018-04-23 16:53:15 We also know this tax will not even be a blip on the scale for decrease in emissions of the entire planet.  Remember when energy conservation was needed during the oil crisis.  No tax was needed to get everyone to participate.
3281 2018-04-23 16:52:53 They will not care TP cos Yemen has not got Oil or Gas or any assets that USA Corporations can strip for profit
3282 2018-04-23 16:52:44 Alberta, while you’re at it kick Texas Big Oil out of our country. We don’t want them or need them. Send them home. They have no place in our Canadian culture. They’re nothing like us. #oilandgas #pipeline Go back to what you did before Tar Sands.

3284 2018-04-23 16:52:36 I loved driving my BMW, but every repair ran at least $500 when there was something wrong, and there was always something wrong, even when I took it in for an oil change.
3285 2018-04-23 16:52:29 actually the earth will be just fine, it survived worse but we won't survive ... thats why we have to support #TESLA in its mission to kick out the #FossilFuel #OIL Mafia!
3286 2018-04-23 16:52:20 When I felt like death last week from gastroenteritis the only way I could get from the floor to the bed was with #cbd oil ... natural and it worked quickly. Thank you @ medreleaf
3287 2018-04-23 16:52:05 this was the first result for "drinking oil through a straw" wrong type of oil but still. slurp
3288 2018-04-23 16:52:01 Oil?
3289 2018-04-23 16:51:43 @realDonaldTrump In SW New Mexico if we are paying $4.00 a gallon and oil prices are over $100 bbl
Everybody is making a good living here people all over the USA come west Texas and SW New Mexico to work 1 drilling rig employes over 100 people
3290 2018-04-23 16:51:29 I dont think this is directed at the Oil/McDavid. I see his point as why is making the playoffs the measuring stick for the Hart. I honestly believe more goalies should be nominated, no one player is more valuable to their team than the starter imo

3293 2018-04-23 16:51:08 Shit, we need to get on this.

Two babies covered in baby oil, dressed up in ridiculous outfits and/or facepaint. Put in a play pen.

Roll cameras. Cash money.
3294 2018-04-23 16:51:08 10yr USTs up circa 17bp in a week; broad dollar is up about 1%. Cause and effect. The yield rise is due to exogenous factors  (oil), as opposed to frothing US domestic demand. So, USD shorts need to respect the yield drag and wait for the coming improved levels to short.
3295 2018-04-23 16:51:05 Also the majority of refined gasoline in Ontario comes from the USA which is refined “Tar Sands” oil, LOL
3296 2018-04-23 16:50:51 Adding olive oil makes for amazing holes and twisty juicy fibres.
3297 2018-04-23 16:50:50 あれはめっちゃ笑いましたね(笑)
3298 2018-04-23 16:50:46 Aur 1 baat Shri Lanka petrol India se khareedta hai..phir b Shri Lanka me petrol 42 rupees Ka petrol milta hai..chahe to Google me b check Kar ..19% oil supply karta hai India shrilanka ko..
3299 2018-04-23 16:50:42 When I do the chunky twist on a looser twist out then I use light oil massaged through my hands. If it’s a twist out from my mini twists then I use the Jane carter hydrate spray.
3300 2018-04-23 16:50:33 Let's get off the oil. Period.

3304 2018-04-23 16:49:50 Oil related? Or function of USD rally?
3305 2018-04-23 16:49:48 I know someone that calls CLP “CLiP oil” and I find that really fucking annoying
3306 2018-04-23 16:49:34 Gundlach: notes that $XOP (the oil and gas ETF) has been showing technical signs of strength, busting above the 200day SMA
3307 2018-04-23 16:49:22 Quoteable quote "Half knowledge is dangers" Modi agreed it was a political wrong statement. Was it BJP manifesto? Crud oil is imported to India and they keep on fluctuating depending on the political development in the Middle East. In 60 years of @INCIndia rule how much did 1/2
3308 2018-04-23 16:49:13 オイルだからってオイルツイートばかりな訳じゃないぞ。油ツイートもするよ。
3309 2018-04-23 16:49:12 Do you think @APrecourt could manage a quick change oil shop?  I don't think so.
3310 2018-04-23 16:49:01 I like coconut oil
3311 2018-04-23 16:48:56 Kewpie + siracha. For spicy tuna add a dash of good sesame oil.
3312 2018-04-23 16:48:54 When Randall said “I wake up to a scarf and coconut oil. I’m married to a black queen”  #thisisus
3313 2018-04-23 16:48:53 Normally, when change is pushed, groups wanting this change show us the path. Usually it starts out $$ and drops $ over time. The fact the watch house has a gas generator for construction, & protesters are sitting in Kayaks made of oil, tells me the path forward isn't ready yet.
3314 2018-04-23 16:48:48 I want the return of "win your weight in [local product]." Giant scales, rider on one side, pile of cheese, ham, fruit, motor oil, whatever on the other.
3315 2018-04-23 16:48:38 I've always wanted to ask what exactly are "vegetable oils" here? For example Wikipedia lists coconut oil (which I thought was pretty healthy to cook with); olive oil (fine in say salad dressing and small quantities) and walnut oil (fairly ideal Omega-3 and 6 balance)?
3316 2018-04-23 16:48:27 Omg so she actually bit into a cod liver oil capsule !?!?!?
3317 2018-04-23 16:48:07 One of my favorites from my early days as a Sox fan. Roger Clemens, Bruce Hurst, and Oil Can Boyd.
3318 2018-04-23 16:48:04 Probably not. If American politicians didn't stand to make a fortune out of the war, would they even bother? After all, many more atrocities around the world have resulted in more deaths, but they don't have the oil or the planned pipeline needed for corporate prosperity.
3319 2018-04-23 16:47:59 Stability and inexpensive oil? Germany spent 20th C attempting to militarily dominate Europe when they could have become an economic powerhouse. For some insane sense of German superiority, they started WW2 with horses pulling cannons. German highways packed with cars by 1980’s.
3320 2018-04-23 16:47:55 Beginning to feel like North America may be turning a corner, that oil barons just might be imagining/accepting that the business of oil growth as the norm no longer smart business choice. Just beginning to feel that way.
3321 2018-04-23 16:47:53 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
3322 2018-04-23 16:47:38 He’s eating a shit-ton of oil from the shitty diet he’s on.

3327 2018-04-23 16:47:15 Finally getting my oil changed...
3328 2018-04-23 16:47:13 Why title this so negatively "Trump's Revenge?" 

This is a great thing 4 consumers as competition will lower prices & put @OPECSecretariat, which is constantly charged w/inflating oil prices, & Russia on notice.

Further proof of @POTUS #NoCollusion & not BN a #RussianPuppet
3329 2018-04-23 16:47:08 Drove to toga to get food and get a oil change, got to toga and realized I don’t have my wallet. #thankgodforissac

3333 2018-04-23 16:46:49 Thanks for reminding me to pour my used motor oil into the storm drain.
3334 2018-04-23 16:46:40 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
3335 2018-04-23 16:46:37 Lol. 
Well an MSC holder who was a former University lecturer and a former deputy governor of an oil rich state once ruled over this country and it was like a Blind Deaf and Dumb man was ruling over us. 
As for Buhari, u even tried. He's like a dead man ruling over us.
3336 2018-04-23 16:46:37 In the oil industry we deployed web conferencing in 1984. Aimed to reduce travel. It did the opposite! Email however is a great medium to confirm the discussion, actions and timeline. Without a written record of some sort we descend into he said she said behaviour.
3337 2018-04-23 16:46:32 You're using the #NATFACT source for your laughable thoughts. The Clare field discovered decades ago, you should research the difference between discovery & recovery first. When you've done that look up market forces on oil/gas prices/sustainability. Salmond didn't...we laughed

3341 2018-04-23 16:45:49 She’s still no Bernie Sanders. This is like when an oil company green washes itself by running ads about how it saves baby birds from oil slicks.

3343 2018-04-23 16:45:31 Untill you arabs come with that oil money and changed our imams into your firebrand wahabism, we never had this issue.

3347 2018-04-23 16:44:53 Three institutions raised their price targets on Petrofac, Jeffries, SocGen and Goldman Sachs rating the oil services group a “Buy”. Petrofac rallied 17p in response to 616p.
3348 2018-04-23 16:44:52 Doesn't matter. As long as the purchase price of house or $50 was NOT below market, which those are not, @EPA should not harass #Pruitt. 
TX OK colleges source so many oil executives and lobbyists makes sense they are friends with @EPAScottPruitt
3349 2018-04-23 16:44:50 Why do cooking shows always say 'Add a tablespoon of oil' as they're adding like ten tablespoons worth to their pans?

3401 2018-04-23 16:39:19 CBD has no drugged feeling to it.  AND I can show you studies that prove #CBD mitigates that feeling in #THC so regular users like myself can use a 1-1 strain or oil & feel no psychoactive effects.  I ran the gamut of psyche meds too!

3403 2018-04-23 16:39:04 The left has lost it. They can no longer be given the keys to this country. They will let their friends trash the car, they won’t change the oil or the tires then one day they’ll wake up and bitch about their POS car to their parents.
3404 2018-04-23 16:38:48 @FinMinIndia @PetroleumMin @arunjaitley you increase the fuel prices when international prices goes up.. but why did you forget to reduce it when oil prices went down..?? @PMOIndia @narendramodi ..kya yahi hai ache din..??

3406 2018-04-23 16:38:33 Carbon taxes are a bare knuckle money grab that gives governments a vested interest in perpetuating CO₂ pollution. They aren’t paid by producers, but passed on to consumers. Unlike renewable energy, which is essentially free after  capital costs, oil & gas consumers keep paying.
3407 2018-04-23 16:38:27 @WythamWoods1 btw, I think that 'oily sheen' is a natural phenomenon and not oil pollution.
3408 2018-04-23 16:38:26 we are paying a carbon tax right now of 18 cents per liter but it is all going to the oil companies we don't get any back to u

3410 2018-04-23 16:38:12 Cheh's and Mendelson's position is so senseless--are oil changes more important than grocery stores?--that I strongly suspect something else is driving it. Their war with Joe Mamo? I don't know. Some journo should dig around...

3428 2018-04-23 16:35:43 U are delusional. No one in the long run is going to pay double or more for oil and gas just because they are not a Putin fan, that's silly . It's called shooting urself unnecessarily on the foot for a process that's not as straightforward as ready oil. Common sense prevails.
3429 2018-04-23 16:35:35 I'll refer you back to the original question , at this stage I've lost count - "if theres No oil and extraction cost too much why do England and Westminster keep subsidising Scotland why not cut us loose ....what's in it for them?"
3430 2018-04-23 16:35:25 That’s what is driving oil prices higher.

3437 2018-04-23 16:34:44 I think of them as being more sexually than alimentarily suggestive (though stuff-ing could go either way, and I guess you could deep-fry something in adverbial oil). But whiz-deletion primarily evokes micturition to me, so I wondered what about it made you think of junk food.

3446 2018-04-23 16:34:20 @CBCOntarioToday Hello Gardening Show, and Ed.  Just wondering about why dormat oil is not to be used on delicious apple trees.  Why is that ? But it is okay to use  for all other fruit trees, including crabapple and serviceberry.  Is that correct? Thanks, Vicky from Copetown.
3447 2018-04-23 16:34:06 Just went to Lucky’s w the intention of eating a slice of pizza & buying olive oil. I ate sushi, bought $33 worth of random shit & left with no olive oil. Why am I this way?
3448 2018-04-23 16:34:01 Bravo @SenBillNelson They don't need the stress of possibly being left homeless. They need long range assurance. It's like the old Fram oil filter commercial "Pay me now, or pay me later". If the US Govt had gone in to PR right the 1st time all of this could have been prevented.

3452 2018-04-23 16:33:31 It is not a "belief" that there is zero scientific evidence to support the claims that Eucalyptus radiata oil supports respiratory function and immunity. The belief is your false claim that is works.
3453 2018-04-23 16:33:31 I think Trump is just trying to drive us all insane with gaslighting.

He does stuff like saying he's going to protect the wildlife in the Arctic by allowing unrestricted oil drilling and rolling back EPA laws and regs.  And you try to process that and it drives you insane.

Like garlic, mint only acts as a repellent rather than a poison. The strong odor is often successful in keeping stink bugs away.

3534 2018-04-23 16:25:00 So, quickly looking at the article for instance - the top 10 oil brands were discount brands. We can essentially guarantee that discount brands aren’t going to be non-gmo verified. How much then of the 62% premium for oils is simply because discount brands dominate?
3535 2018-04-23 16:24:53 You kill hundreds of penguins and burn the oil from them

3538 2018-04-23 16:24:46 These gas prices are outrageous. Rising by the day. Hopefully @realDonaldTrump will work on not letting these oil companies take advantage of a booming economy.
3539 2018-04-23 16:24:39 Welp, the legging selling moms have now started selling CBD oil.  This is the fourth horseman.
3540 2018-04-23 16:24:36 “While these catastrophic incidents are not common, they're possible, and no amount of regulations can completely protect us from that happening.” Unless of course, you’re oil is from Alberta. Then we just say NO, right McIdiot??!
3541 2018-04-23 16:24:35 Yeah Califona  that State is so broke it can’t pay attention with all it’s regulation.. next time you fly remember it takes fuel oil!! We need less regulation not more

What about all the American ones? 

It’s Scotland’s oil matey 
3543 2018-04-23 16:24:26 So a bitcoin isn't 100x the value of a barrel of oil rather it is around 10x. Still sounds like a doctor evil thing with a single bitcoin being worth 500 million dollars
3544 2018-04-23 16:24:18 Hahahahahahahha, burn the midnight oil. All is well

3550 2018-04-23 16:23:47 My cat is focused on a cat food futures. He wants guaranteed quarterly delivery of a bag of 16lb cat food for the next 5 years at today's prices. He's hedged on kitty litter prices by using oil prices. I don't ask how. He doesn't tell. Cat got his tongue.
3551 2018-04-23 16:23:42 This is daft, bar the fact both play attacking football and had a run in the cup you can’t compare. One of Europe’s greatest ever clubs playing in arguably the best league in the world vs a tax haven, oil club that has to pay actors to fill its car park stadium!

3557 2018-04-23 16:23:14 Getting my oil changed at a JiffyLube, another customer starts whining that they’re taking too long to service his Porsche. Then says there was no way he was paying $450 at the dealership. Maybe you shouldn’t have a bought Porsche. #MidlifeCrisis much?
3558 2018-04-23 16:23:06 Yeah I know so unless Juve lower the price then I doubt City will get him. But even with being so responsible City still get called "Oil money fc" and other dumb insults.

3562 2018-04-23 16:22:47 Was looking forward to a nice week off with no school or work then realized I need an oil change, tire changeover, my taxes aren’t done, and have a dentist appt

3564 2018-04-23 16:22:43 @ASRCAdReview, so question for you folks. Is claiming a product is vegan & it turns out that the products contain lanolin oil, beeswax, & possibly carmine considered to be false advertising?
3565 2018-04-23 16:22:40 Need to wash off this argan oil. It stings today, for some reason
3566 2018-04-23 16:22:37 we are at $2.60 on the edge of the Bakken oil field.
3567 2018-04-23 16:22:29 Reducing excise duty is temp solution. Govt should take back d rights of fixing prices 4m oil companies.

3569 2018-04-23 16:22:19 Every day is the Earth Day. I don't have a car, I use public transport, I don't eat meat or food that is produced somewhere far away in another country. I don't smoke, I don't use anything that includes palm oil, I don't buy new clothes all the time only very rarely, etc.
3570 2018-04-23 16:22:12 Probably your diet, cut out dairy and vegetable oil, see if it helps
3571 2018-04-23 16:21:50 Which is almost funny, when you see that some retailers are been cleaning up, while $DKS is down 35% over the past 5 years. If you were looking for a fig leaf to cover up your own poor leadership/execution, maybe this is it.

Easier than competing successfully, I guess...

3573 2018-04-23 16:21:19 I’m getting my oil changed & there is an older female mechanic (kicking ass & still working with a broken arm btw) who is teaching an apprentice mechanic in his early 20s how to service a transmission. Feeling this moment SO HARD

He didn't have any oil sobs. I'd have to go later bleh
3578 2018-04-23 16:20:38 Poor response about foreign oil companies! Where's your funding - deflects question.
3579 2018-04-23 16:20:29 It's called oil pulling lol
3580 2018-04-23 16:20:18 The mine owners closed mines as they were inefficient and couldn't compete with oil, and nuclear.
Wind won't replace nuclear as it's not a base load.
3581 2018-04-23 16:19:55 No to Pompeo & other nominees with conflict of interest issues. Removing science from EPA  is wrong. Deregulation of regulations that improve health & country is wrong. No to selling off our natural resources - oil, gas, mining, timber.
3582 2018-04-23 16:19:51 if you ask yourself why so much emphasis with venezuela is because they recovered their oil industry and because they also stopped selling their oil in dollars and now they quote it in yuan and in their own cryptocurrency

3594 2018-04-23 16:18:46 Norwegians must just use magic to extract oil and manage to build a successful economy. Seems us Scots just arent capable of such sorcery according to the Yoonatic fringe.
3595 2018-04-23 16:18:44 I hate simple explanations.  Iraq.  Syria,  Libya?  No.  These were far less about oil than about the real reason, war itself.  It's this country's biggest most profitable business, and export.

these same rules only apply to our resources,all the oil imported from overseas doesn't need to go by the same rules,regs our own product does. No other CDN sector has such an unlevel playing field imposed by their own gov.

3630 2018-04-23 16:12:58 Delta ran a damn oil refinery. Poorly. They are trying to have their cake and eat it. Fuck them.
3631 2018-04-23 16:12:46 I think we need to increase taxes. Another few % on the HST (call it the Muskrat Falls tax), on gas and heating oil. Maybe income tax too.

3669 2018-04-23 16:07:14 The ranchers & oil cronies should be very ashamed of themselves for stealing the wild horses & burros home range that was designated only for them. I pray that there will be a good group that will take them and give them a home but not to be sent to their deaths for greed.
3670 2018-04-23 16:07:06 Yield on 10Y U.S. Treasuries hits 2.99%, its highest since Jan 2014 lifting the dollar index to a seven-week peak of 90.4 & Gold to a 2 week low. Yields point to a high inflation on account of surge in oil & metals. Fed signalling on future rate hikes also supports rising yields
3671 2018-04-23 16:07:02 I drove 40 miles each way in a Grand Marquis to attend an Earth Day BBQ. We burned meat.
3672 2018-04-23 16:07:01 The sooner BC switches to electric cars the better and an oil embargo would help immensely.
3673 2018-04-23 16:06:55 The ME Distabilizes itself! We will always defend Israel and Its interests. the other  part of it has always been out about oil  that changes as we become more self reliant! I didn’t see anyone bitching while obama bombed the shit out of the ME for years
3674 2018-04-23 16:06:31 You might be right in that, but that is a misconception/snake oil between the public relations departments and the most naive media.
3675 2018-04-23 16:06:21 We love coconut oil too! Do you use the oil for cooking?
3676 2018-04-23 16:06:18 ECONOMIC INDICATORS: 23 April @ 18:00 
The dollar is trading at R12,26, the euro at R14,99 and the British pound at R17,11. Gold is selling at $1324,55 a fine ounce and Brent crude oil is quoted at $73,86 a barrel.

3677 2018-04-23 16:06:15 Reality today: 

Some commodities like #OIL do not give 2 f***s about the stronger dollar nor the rising yields.
3678 2018-04-23 16:06:14 Palm oil is not only bad for the climate: As their forest habitat is cleared, endangered species such as the orangutan, Borneo elephant and Sumatran tiger are being pushed closer to extinction.

3681 2018-04-23 16:06:11 Wait, the source for the money is drilling for oil?  Is that right?
3682 2018-04-23 16:06:03 Whatever the taste..., All the dishes above have small or large doses of fried oil in it...., It may taste heavenly but it’s damaging us..Try for 1 week oil free food & see the difference ! It holds true for veg or nonVeg equally!

Those Muslims are just relishing on a territorial advantage without any skill of their own. 

So absolutely no point in boasting about being Muslims in that part of the earth.

more likely than you think
3726 2018-04-23 16:00:24 Remember if you're changing your own headlights, don't touch the glass. Oil from your fingers can cause cracks sooner.
3727 2018-04-23 16:00:23 I've seen many versions of this on the beach. You guys are too young to remember this but everyone tried to get darker than the other and strange  products were used. Baby oil/iodine, Crisco oil, sun in mixed w/baby oil. Some gals were desperate! Me? Panama Jack Medallion Oil!

3738 2018-04-23 15:59:19 Complete bans (or proposals) on palm oil are having negative impacts on conservation in Borneo. Need to be more rational
3739 2018-04-23 15:59:10 Nothing in particular. Taleb talks about a division between butter eaters and olive oil eaters. Turns out, that's a fairly recent distinction.
3740 2018-04-23 15:59:06 Just put castor oil/ coconut oil on them before bed and when you’re not wearing make up. That’s what I did and they weren’t great after but it could have been so much worse. Now I use this lash boost stuff and they are amazing

3749 2018-04-23 15:57:38 You know, no joke, I've heard good things about coconut oil cooking spray for the same purpose.
3750 2018-04-23 15:57:22 people at work asked what I put in my hair to keep it healthy and I was like UH JUST CONDITIONER. That's a fucking lie. I pour olive oil from the kitchen directly on my head and then wrap that shit in Saran wrap while I watch my stories.

3759 2018-04-23 15:56:36 I suggest some butt oil might cure that.

3770 2018-04-23 15:55:57 Producing oil is lucrative but "provinces" will get their cumuppance at some point in the future when it's not.  Just bizarre analysis as usual.
3771 2018-04-23 15:55:48 And the reason for his supposedly working for “no salary“ is because he’s using his presidency for the profit of his businesses, unethically. You are defending a grand snake oil salesman.

3806 2018-04-23 15:52:12 >> What happened to stronger dollar / weaker oil relationship ?

Rule of thumb : Don't trust such correlations. They often fail.
3807 2018-04-23 15:52:07 silly.....

nbr of charging stations is not an issue.  this is probably just smoke funded by oil money.

biggest problems are cost of car and range of car on a single charge.

3822 2018-04-23 15:50:24 That oil plus potato thing is an old-school method, but I’ve seen bad results (including burnt-on potato peel crud). I think applying very thin layers of oil (buffed to look totally dry), and heating like that is better. Then you can cook in it, fry in it after for more seasoning

3829 2018-04-23 15:49:46 Over-washing your mug removes natural oils which can actually cause your face to over-produce oil. (We just can't win, can we?) It's only necessary to wash your face twice a day, once in the morning and once at night #skincare

3837 2018-04-23 15:48:46 9. Add red chili powder, garam masala, turmeric and salt. Fry all until nice aroma comes out. By now the raw smell should have gone away.
10. Add water as needed to make a gravy. Cook until the gravy thickens and oil begins to separate. Check the salt and adjust if needed.

3842 2018-04-23 15:48:10 Amber says the 3k is an old rule of thumb and most cars go at least 5k now between oil changes. 10k is under perfect circumstances, like no stop and go, no super long drives at high speeds, no bad weather, etc.

3859 2018-04-23 15:46:08 End of the day, the deal on paper shows Larsson for Hall.(which we agree is overpay). But we all know the deal was made with Looch signed. If Looch learns to skate again and puts up his regular 50 points,the Oil are a better team with those 2 than with Hall and some plug Dman IMO
3860 2018-04-23 15:45:49 I grew up putting coconut oil in my hair. The fact that so many people use it for consumption these days is a little strange for me.
3861 2018-04-23 15:45:44 (How to make the recipe)
1. Puree onions and tomatoes separately. Set them aside.
2. Boil the eggs, remove the shells and prick them with fork randomly.
3. Saute eggs in oil until golden. Set aside.
4. In the same pan, saute cinnamon, bay leaf, cardamoms and cloves.
3862 2018-04-23 15:45:44 #OOTT | According to @DeutscheBank chief Macro Strategist, another $5/barrel increase in oil would be enough for US 10y yields to threaten 3%, which also suggests that oil is now at the cusp of levels where higher prices will spark greater FX and broader asset market volatility.

3867 2018-04-23 15:44:59 Could oil soon reach $400 /barrel + Gold $4000+ per ounce? is highly likely in conjunction with USA stock market correction + EU + UK. It not the buying power of USD increasing but opposite as USD will b falling to its true buying power as #BTC takes world reserve currency status
3868 2018-04-23 15:44:58 Agreed. And when they start closing stores in the mid US, they’ll say it’s covariance or online strategy or something.

3899 2018-04-23 15:41:16 Why would anyone make a stand that's going to alienate a large segment of your potential market? That cooler company built its brand on the outdoor market, and it just pissed off a giant segment there. We'll see if the annual sales are dinged, but I bet they will suffer.

3931 2018-04-23 15:38:59 D’uh Canada’s economy is getting natural resources to foreign markets. ( like oil ) it’s kinda how our economy works and why we can have things like universal health care but you are right let’s shut it down.
3932 2018-04-23 15:38:55 Yes, their advice of rubbing w oil for maintenance w/o heating the pan only works if you use the pan all the time. If it sits for a week or two, it's gonna get sticky. I dont recommend it.

3945 2018-04-23 15:36:55 No way they'd break that out. It could confirm (or refute) the validity of this new path they've chosen too easily.
3946 2018-04-23 15:36:44 His loyalty is to big $ donors & fossil fuel industry. Rollback of EPA PROTECTIONS has not created any new jobs as more work in solar energy than coal, gas & oil combined. He has repealed workplace SAFETY protections, repealed equal pay for women, lifted ban on African trophies.
3947 2018-04-23 15:36:42 Wonder what euro bank position is on investing in Russian, Iraq, Iran, Nigeria, Sudan, etc oil projects is?

3950 2018-04-23 15:36:15 The US shale oil and gas boom wasn't driven by profitability--it was made possible by debt and equity investors. However, that might be changing.
3951 2018-04-23 15:36:11 This happens with my asthma too. I was on a plane and this woman covered herself in peppermint oil and  I had trouble breathing the entire flight. I had to give myself a huge dose of steroids mid-flight to make it.
3952 2018-04-23 15:36:10 Do you think Notley has the kahona’s to cut off oil to BC?  I can’t see it.
3953 2018-04-23 15:36:08 I get yelled at for not getting the oil changed...i leave to get my oil changed and mom calls me telling me stay home to wait on a package ... I can't win
3954 2018-04-23 15:36:04 Shes stupid for saying this. SHE came up off someone elsed money and resources. If i went to college and got a degree i can be proud of that accomplishment and she can stop thinkin shes the shit for a half ass hair oil line and some weak ass lipstick. BYE

3961 2018-04-23 15:35:28 'Long Haul', a bit of special pleading there?

Where would your claims be borne out in the numbers?  

Is this really about economics? Are you just a shill for the oil producers?
3962 2018-04-23 15:35:22 Oh my should i buy bio oil? 1200 lang siya sa s&r
3963 2018-04-23 15:35:21 But now the oil is shipping by physical truck only adding to the overall carbon footprint of the oil. And it is now crossing in a far more dangerous overland route, and along highways. Is this the preference to make the oil more damaging?

3966 2018-04-23 15:34:39 On the COT report (found on the CFTC website), I only look at "managed money" for WTI crude ("crude oil, light sweet). So I add total longs + total shorts together, then I divide the shorts by that number to see what % of the total positions are short.

3972 2018-04-23 15:34:02 @Hyundai Your 100,000 power train warranty means nothing if you won't cover transmission seepage & oil pan seepage at 82,800 miles. Its a breach in the gaskets and or deemed defective.
3973 2018-04-23 15:33:39 Haha u are right. Read this - Despite strong growth performance driven by the oil sector, the Libyan economy is still suffering from political strife that hinders it from reaching its potential.
3974 2018-04-23 15:33:38 Coconut oil saves lives

3978 2018-04-23 15:32:51 I’m waiting with a client and two siblings , probably high school walk past me smelling like the gods they are; Cantu conditioner, cocoa butter, oil and Blackness 
3979 2018-04-23 15:32:38 tea tree oil is my holy grail for getting my skin back to normal after the hormone changes of having my IUD put in last May. It has saved my skin from cystic breakouts 
3980 2018-04-23 15:32:38 Because they're both grandstanding self important snake oil salesmen?
3981 2018-04-23 15:32:35 I’ve been doing this salad. Spinach, lettuce, cucumber, tomato, beetroot, reddish, spring onions + feta cheese, olives and walnuts with the sauce of olive oil, balsamic, salt and pepper annnnnd lemon. It’s perfect!  that looks like a lot now that I look at it. Can add mint too!
3982 2018-04-23 15:32:35 Yes, virgin coconut oil retains its flavor but loses some in baking so I'd suggest also using some coconut extract.
3983 2018-04-23 15:32:32 Shall we also stop treating the symptom instead of the cause? Lets stop propping up colonial proxies in the ME! The 'salafist dictators' have been put in place by the west so that we can get cheap oil. Let's boycot that!

3985 2018-04-23 15:32:26 Yeah, I was just thinking of getting it when I get this foundation, read the ingredients and it has orange PEEL oil, that's toxic to sensitive skin so that's gonna be a no for me
3986 2018-04-23 15:32:22 Equioxx/Previcox? Can your vet set you up with a script at Valley Vet? Another barn horse was on it. It did not help Shane’s laminitis pain. Check out cetyl M and Cosequine with ASU. And flax seed/oil = omega3 fatty acids
3987 2018-04-23 15:32:21 Yeah they lying. The oil in Dubai emirate ran out in 2016. 

Abu Dhabi has the most deposits but it also isn't that much
3988 2018-04-23 15:32:19 Ethical oil, is like humane beef industry, we do less damage when we extract our oil compared to other oil producing countries, My point is we need to see the big picture; worry more on energy & economic independence a more clear & present threat
3989 2018-04-23 15:32:06 Disagree to a point. Excellent management is about not being afraid to make change. And with that change comes good and bad on a per trade basis. But how does the overall team complexion look? Chicago who has been one of the best teams the past decade has made some questionable.
3990 2018-04-23 15:32:02 Fu-kers won’t cop to global warming because they’re ALL INVESTED IN OIL. Point blank.
3991 2018-04-23 15:32:01 The people aren't killed by Assad. They're killed by ISIS and it is funded by the US to destroy Syria so they could easily get access to the oil...

LED bulbs from 300 to 40 per piece made possible by Modi. Oil prices acting as heel of Achilles . But have faith in Modi.
3995 2018-04-23 15:31:52 Similar to honey, when shopping for coconut oil, is there any indicator of quality or purity one should be looking for?
3996 2018-04-23 15:31:47 I’m very interested to see their performance by region. I bet their midwestern and TX stores are just dying.

4021 2018-04-23 15:29:31 Can coconut oil be used in a recipe to add coconut flavor, or is it better to just use coconut flakes?
Like if I wanted to bake a chocolate cookie that had some coconuttyness to it but didn't want to pick bits of coconut out of my teeth.

4042 2018-04-23 15:27:52 I doubt Russia will be on 6th place. Having reached 12th place now, it can hardly grow well, but for oil wealth, which is very uncertain in future.
4043 2018-04-23 15:27:49 Xq habría otra q sería “lengua catalana”. Cuando se habla en contexto en el q se mencionan otras lenguas cooficiales de España, se dice castellano. Sino, se dice español. Igual q en Italia se dice italiano y no toscano, o en Francia francés y no “langue d’oïl “.
4044 2018-04-23 15:27:34 The beginning of the troubles-if any oil facilities will be targeted in SA the oil prices will go up, but who really is more interested in raising the prices (Saudi, Russia, USA or Iran) we don't know-probably everyone!

4078 2018-04-23 15:23:39 Absolutely right. Looking forward to see how much Syrian oil my £350's getting very soon.
4079 2018-04-23 15:23:37 $INCC wondering if any one has done the math for the present press release for CBD. found a couple of references saying it 3:1 CBD to oil, with prices of $30 to $140 for 500 milagram of oil.

4081 2018-04-23 15:23:18 Wait, what? Yes more people are able to afford cars in the US. This has nothing to do with keeping gas prices low. Gas prices are dictated by the price of crude oil and regulation. California has the highest population and the highest gas prices in the country.

4084 2018-04-23 15:22:30 C&C would be great... if everybody did it. That's a huge "if." (Oil Wars...) Fee and dividend harnesses global markets to solve that huge "if."

We have a triage situation. We have to slow the hemorrhaging of CO2 immediately. I think that's a better metaphor than the river.

4092 2018-04-23 15:22:01 would diluting it with another oil work or does it have to be with water?
4093 2018-04-23 15:21:51 Only way we’ll find out is if pump them both full of adrenaline and make them oil up and fight!
4094 2018-04-23 15:21:34 Are you suggesting that all those roads or infra created by government  by using oil bounty be reversed back and would have been used for revenue expenses ?

4097 2018-04-23 15:21:32 Now is the time to reach out to Cuba, extend a olive branch and see if they bite,  If not cut them off from everything and embargo Venezuela to stop oil shipment to Cuba.  That should kill two problems.

4110 2018-04-23 15:20:12 Consumers,especially big buyers respond to pricing not ethics. Our product is expensive, both in processing and in labour costs. The “ethical oil” narrative is a Ezra Levant fairy tale.

4144 2018-04-23 15:17:04 I'd suggest putting it in the freezer if you know you're NOT going to use it, but what do you usually use it for? If you regularly use Earth Balance or something like that, I'd say just sub the coconut oil.
4145 2018-04-23 15:16:55 As to your oil article today; was it not some talk of selling a little of strategic reserves? Was some 722 million barrels a few years back when imports where necessary.

4161 2018-04-23 15:14:15 Wow!! You'll have to explain to people, especially geologists, how Scotland manufactured oil.  That's aside from actually claiming that Scotland would be bankrupt without the English - laughable.
4162 2018-04-23 15:14:15 Oil and gas make up between 2-6% of Canadas GDP. Thats hardly a monopoly 
4163 2018-04-23 15:14:12 It is a bill that may result in the scrap of petroleum monitoring agencies such as Dpr

4174 2018-04-23 15:12:27 Honestly? Often I only like a little bit of olive oil in salad's I eat and feta I never like when it has dressing or vinaigrette thrown in it
4175 2018-04-23 15:12:25 So there are occasionally some communications people at major companies that are intelligent.
4176 2018-04-23 15:12:23 Agreed, the trajectory to become a contender starts with playoffs.  It is also usually proceeded by excellent management. If you think Chiarelli provides that, that’s fine.  I’d think we can agree to disagree.  My take is that excellent management means not making many errors.

4179 2018-04-23 15:12:17 But modern medicine is often superior to natural folk medicine. e.g. smallpox was eradicated by modern medicine. Same with leprosy. Folk remedies like chaulmoogra tree oil might have had some effect, but these never actually eradicated the diseases.

4324 2018-04-23 14:56:35 @TheRickHoweShow Because there's no real competition in gasoline, diesel, etc. anymore. Last time crude oil had to be over $120/barrel to reach these prices. Now it's almost half that. IF we had no regulation, what would we be paying for gas? Whatever they can get away with.

4370 2018-04-23 14:51:38 Oil prices hit an huge low in 2016 and fell as low as $27 per barrell. Oil prices have since recovered very little of this increase is brexit related

4389 2018-04-23 14:50:13 Thus the rationale or hypothesis for administering  fish oil during season, 1 gm off season/3 gms in daily.  Its an anti inflammatory,  that crosses the blood brain barrier and contributes to myelin sheath conditioning from what I understand
4390 2018-04-23 14:50:11 I use regular shampoo , must use conditioner though. So whatever I buy fir myself they use .

4436 2018-04-23 14:46:29 Crude oil price at US $ 74 per barrel is still lower than US $ 105 four years ago. So, why are Petrol/Diesel prices higher today than they were in May 2014?

4461 2018-04-23 14:43:45 Lets start rephrase that. Worse trade in the last decade was erat for Forsberg.  No one talks about as Caps have had a ton of success and GM now runs the very successful Golden Knights. Oilers fans will stop discussing the trade when the Oilers make the playoffs again next year.

4472 2018-04-23 14:42:09 I guess you spend most of your days over at CNN. The President not only has implemented sanctions, but he weakened Russia's wealth on oil, killed over 200 Russian soldiers, expelled their diplomats, and attacked his Putin's buddy, Assad. I guess Obama's, CUT IT OUT, scared Putin?
4473 2018-04-23 14:41:53 I’d suggest that the criticism continues for two reasons.  First, it’s probably the worst NHL trade in at least a decade.  Second, the guy who made it is still in charge and still making bad deals.   

Once Chiarelli is gone, Oiler fans will mostly stop discussing it.

4501 2018-04-23 14:38:57 Hello Chioma..... heard you on the morning program last week where you said 
you needed real coconut oil.  just to let you know i have. i make it myself and it is the real thing.@chiomabbb
4502 2018-04-23 14:38:56 Which is a crazy about-turn considering what happened between  during early/mid 90s 

Baku sends its oil to Ceyhan via  Not forgetting  (+ethnic Azeri) who ally with  and  (cultural ties with )

NATO already has heavy presence in region. 

Why bother?

4505 2018-04-23 14:38:34 The @AsoRock should be more responsible in protecting citizens & environmental rights. It should pull out itself from dirty oil politics that has perennially suffocated d people, national economy.

4507 2018-04-23 14:38:21 He’s got the MP4/13 oil in the oven already. It’s gotta be pre-heated to at least 150F to work properly.

4509 2018-04-23 14:38:11 Unpopular opinion: Coconut oil is garbage.
4510 2018-04-23 14:37:56 Haha snake oil salesman 

-The back pain is generated by the weight of the system plus batteries. Selling remedies for ailments created by said remedies is the best way to make cash 
4511 2018-04-23 14:37:42 Strange how all the gals recruited by the major and minor Oil Co's, Service Co's like Halliburton, Schlumberger, Baker etc. aren't protesting in the streets, right?
Because they DGAF about old-school titles, like the industry teamwork and competition.

4513 2018-04-23 14:37:06 Oil companies are protecting their assets from climate change. I guess that means they believe in the climate change they’re causing, no?

4521 2018-04-23 14:36:23 Wish you a very Light Sweet and Happy B'day oil goddess. 
4522 2018-04-23 14:36:13 Also, Venezuela's dependance on oil has made easier to sustain nationalists "anti-imperialists" fantasies when there is money flowing and we have seen those fantasies crash with oil markets. So to be anointed abroad is also relative to the realities of Venezuela's economy.
4523 2018-04-23 14:35:59 Watsons or Guardian needs to have a sale so I can stock up on my cleansing oil. And I also want a bunch of crusty dudes to combust seeing the sheer volume of women going in the stores.

4530 2018-04-23 14:35:02 Yea that’s an a massive oversimplification, similar to the “we waste food, while people starve”. Many malnourished survive only through livestock in areas unsuitable for crops (eg subsaharan Africa)
Also you do know all soya meal is a byproduct of human edible oil production.
4531 2018-04-23 14:35:01 The source of that oil.

4544 2018-04-23 14:33:36 How much an individual pays changes a lot depending on whether it’s rate payers or taxpayers dotting the bill. Someone with oil heat is better with no taxpayer subsidy and using that money for a tax cut, reverse is true for someone with electric heat

4546 2018-04-23 14:33:12 They did not tax lamp oil to make people use electric lights! The market made it happen

4550 2018-04-23 14:32:53 tobasco is like ketchup for me. it goes good on everything and tastes delicious.

try this: get some tobasco chipotle, a load of potatoes, a pan, and some oil. Cut the potatoes up into cubes, throw them in the pan with oil, add your favourite spices, and the tobasco sauce.
4551 2018-04-23 14:32:45 tip for the girls: of you're using body oil always apply it first and preferably, on damp skin. then apply all of your other products.

4564 2018-04-23 14:31:28 A start would be to remove policies that impede Alberta from supplying the refineries in Central and Eastern Canada that now import oil. Energy East pipeline was subject to upstream and downstream emissions tests when imported oil gets a free ride.

4591 2018-04-23 14:29:10 Remember the Arab Spring and people struggling for democratisation That was largely snuffed out, with the West's support of the wrong people, in order to protect western oil interests. There were 4 civil wars in the aftermath of the Arab Spring Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen.

4622 2018-04-23 14:26:43 Exactly. It's likely projections about the economic viability of alternatives hinge on higher oil and gas prices. But in a free market, you can't have both falling demand for oil and higher oil prices.

4626 2018-04-23 14:26:32 I really think we should be saving our precious crude oil for plastic for exactly this reason - things where it is a necessity and at the present time there are no viable alternatives. It’s madness we waste this precious resource on carrying things home from the shops 
4627 2018-04-23 14:26:29 I hate when oil change places take advantage of women by overcharging for a simple oil change! They try to say that ur vehicle has an oil leak or it needs an extra quart of oil. It's BS!
4628 2018-04-23 14:26:24 Indian Rupee ended weaker today. Rupee remained under pressure as foreign banks bought Dollars noting arbitrage in NDF market. Strong Dollar index and oil importers' greenback demand triggered banks’ stop-losses. The Rupee ended at 66.48 vs Friday’s close of 66.11.

4637 2018-04-23 14:25:27 But Q3 6.23% to Q4 5.94% is a decline,isn't it?

Then,see data for Q1 and Q2 2015. The trajectory was negative already...with or without crude oil price fall...

4779 2018-04-23 14:12:28 We expect the oil and gas sector to notch up its best financial performance since well before oil prices collapsed in this reporting season – Brent averaged US$67/bbl in Q1, well above the US$55/bbl needed to achieve cash flow flow neutrality.

4785 2018-04-23 14:12:07 I believe employees of the state oil firm are trying to resign but aren't been allowed anymore, soldiers who haven't a clue are in charge hence slow oil production, no parts etc means oil will keep dropping per month. One way to bring down govt.
4786 2018-04-23 14:12:03 Interesting. Ive often heard it said (UK at least) that we're paying for decades (70s ish) of a cavalier attitude of the nuclear industry with trust issues we face now.

4886 2018-04-23 14:00:41 A continued rise in oil prices could eventually force the Fed to lift rates faster and will weigh on consumers by lifting prices at the pump. But for now, most economists would rather see oil prices approaching $70 per barrel than falling below $30.

4908 2018-04-23 13:58:52 "Oil prices have soared 12% this year, partly because of production cuts by OPEC and Russia, which have successfully mopped up the huge supply glut that caused prices to crash"

4910 2018-04-23 13:58:39 Trump's tweet left some wondering whether he wanted a return to early 2016, when oil prices dropped below $30 a barrel. While the slide helped depress gas prices but that was outweighed by the slew of bankruptcies, layoffs and investment cutbacks among oil and gas firms.
4911 2018-04-23 13:58:37 YT channel sounds great! How long have you been using the oil? My mum had started and felt great at the beginning but after about a month or 2 she said the effects like better sleep etc wore off  She was hoping it would help with arthritic pain

4927 2018-04-23 13:56:52 Not everyone believes higher prices are a good thing, of course. On his Twitter account Friday, President Donald Trump wrote: “Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!”
4928 2018-04-23 13:56:51 "Trump has close ties to Harold Hamm, the billionaire who runs Continental Resources, a shale oil producer that benefits from higher oil prices. Hamm gave a primetime speech during the 2016 Republican convention and Trump reportedly considered naming the CEO his energy secretary"

4934 2018-04-23 13:56:22 And some see higher oil prices as a sign of an already-robust economy. One sign of that: a rise in inflation, which has mostly held below the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. 

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed to its highest since early 2014 on Friday.

4950 2018-04-23 13:54:43 "Yet millions of Trump voters also live in states such as Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota that depend on the oil industry for prosperity. The 2014-2016 oil price crash cost jobs and led to dozens of corporate bankruptcies"

4953 2018-04-23 13:54:31 too much fire from school for bringing oil
4954 2018-04-23 13:54:20 US crude oil field production has doubled over the last decade. And U.S. oil rigs have generally been reopening for business over the last year. That means the rebound in oil prices from their lows of two years ago is a boon for energy firms and the companies that supply them.

4961 2018-04-23 13:53:25 Higher oil prices stand to benefit the economy in the U.S., where oil production has ramped up sharply in recent years. After its biggest two-week jump since the end of 2016, Nymex crude oil is approaching $70 a barrel, and last week hit its highest since late 2014.
4962 2018-04-23 13:53:10 We can send the dirtiest oil product on the planet across provincial borders but we can’t send BC wine to the east or craft brews to the province next to us? Ridiculous.

5068 2018-04-23 13:47:40 Pro tip if you’re still shaving for this trash ass barbaric society: rosehip seed oil is great for all kinds of skin inflammation, not just your face. Put some on your legs to soothe follicles and skin. Or smash the patriarchy. Either way.

5106 2018-04-23 13:42:47 Nigeria’s economy was not in s decline when Buhari took over office. What was in decline was oil prices and a government that meant business would have made smart decisions to steer the economy away from recession. 

Please let’s state facts!!

You missed a chance to call your guests out on their praise of Al-Jazeera. They are a news instrument of an oil dictatorship. It is not just based in Qatar, it is sponsored by the government. They are Qatari RT, not the BBC.

5218 2018-04-23 13:28:34 Right. We haven’t had gold for our dollars for a long time. They combat that by making the oil in the Middle East only tradeable by the U.S dollar, essentially backing our entire economy on oil prices worldwide. This is why the Petro-Yuan is so dangerous to the dollar. Lol

5452 2018-04-23 13:04:08 If oil is going to $70. Or maybe higher as some suggest then you will go over 3%. It's inflationary. So far the consensus is 2.95% to 3% max in the 10-year. Over 3% and you have a reversal of fortune's in the SPX.

5490 2018-04-23 13:00:01 Industrial seed oils are referred to as “vegetable oil” to make them seem healthy. This is blatantly misleading. 

These seed oils are not healthy and are likely the main culprit of modern disease.

Just within the last 100 yrs, these toxic seed oils have become widely consumed.

5689 2018-04-23 12:36:12 I'll take my cheap oil and you can take expensive non efficient carbon made wind turbines and chemical made solar panels and also pay the carbon tax on your own breath.
5690 2018-04-23 12:36:09 Only if you guys quit throwing money at clean coal and fracking. Only if you get tough on companies sourcing palm oil from rainforests. Only if you start heavily regulating factory farming.

5705 2018-04-23 12:34:34 1. Better wind turbines 2. No one said we don't need any oil at all; they shut down old fashioned oil rigs in CO because destroying the earth by fracking is more profitable 3. We get you a new attitude; If people like you had been in charge in1776 we'd still be Brittish.

6110 2018-04-23 11:35:00 Well Economists taught me. More oil in the market equals less price. This is simple supply and demand. We are not talking about 10K finance reports and ROE

International crude oil rates is anywhere between $70-$80 per barrel. Whereas in 2008 when the rates were $140 per barrel, petrol rate was Rs. 50.62 now it is Rs. 80.25 . These are Mumbai rates. Please look into the matter as 2019 is fast approaching.

6202 2018-04-23 11:19:17 Even that's overstating it. Many of the Iraq war's biggest proponents--e.g. Paul Wolfowitz--were also proponents of the oil-for-food program; the sanctions that prevented American companies from developing (and profiting from) Iraqi oil fields.

6342 2018-04-23 10:58:53 An application to build five 100-metre tall wind turbines near the Valero oil refinery on the Angle peninsula, Pembs, has been refused for the third time.

6346 2018-04-23 10:58:15 @jiffylube just curious but if my car manufacturer says oil changes every 7500, why would one of the employees give me grief for doing every 7000 and being very snide when he says jiffy lube recommends every 3000 miles. Is your oil not up to my manufacturers standards
6347 2018-04-23 10:58:14 Good but if I make I will use less oil, thanks

6381 2018-04-23 10:50:32 Sure, can you define what you think socialism is real quick? Because an economy with private property does not sound very socialist to me nor is it the socialists fault that the crashing oil price fucked Venezuela's economy because their economy was focused on oil exports

6384 2018-04-23 10:50:17 Well, that's a great argument against government, but if you're going to get into corporate bashing, then I suggest you start by realizing that most of the world's oil production and refinement is government owned and operated.

6483 2018-04-23 10:25:27 Totally agree but those days are gone. Cheap foreign imports will always be more desirable to the masses and hence more profitable than more expensive British made products. There’s no mining left except for offshore oil and even that is dwindling. It’s a tough one

6497 2018-04-23 10:23:39 And yet gasoline just keeps going up. Gas prices are the biggest scam perpetrated by oil monopolies in Canada. Did you ever notice that the price goes up on weekends an holidays? We all have noticed. But nothing is ever done about it by the law.
6498 2018-04-23 10:23:18 Look for a soap made with certified organic oils and oatmeal that’s free of fragrance but may have certified organic essential oils in it. Oatmeal is also soothing. Or just use Olive Oil when shaving your legs, following with a warm water rinse. No soap or irritation.

6508 2018-04-23 10:22:11 Oil is still 37% & coal is 17% look it up. I did. The majority is still dirty fossil fuels followed by Nat gas. Not so clean. Also more EV cars mans more power needed. We already have black outs & strained power generation. EV cars are not a environmental panacea that you think

6510 2018-04-23 10:21:53 You should only do that if they get something bad on their fur, otherwise nope. It takes the oil out of their skin/fur, makes it feel horrible.

6589 2018-04-23 10:02:33 The average price of a gallon of gas spiked nine cents a gallon over the past two weeks to $2.83. Industry analysts say the jump was driven primarily by rising crude oil costs. The current as price is .37 above where it was a yer ago.

6617 2018-04-23 09:55:59 tsk tsk, are you implying that the 65% of oil that India imports from Middle East has all 'jihadist' countries? India "produces" 13% of its oil. There's 0.13 probability that he had been using 'Indian' oil! Any proof contrary to it?!

6622 2018-04-23 09:55:23 You're right; petrol and diesel are very dangerous fluids and the one for the most potential for disaster (crude oil and shale) are being extracted despite Earth citizens demanding a stop to it

6667 2018-04-23 09:47:47 @FoxBusinessAM Consider that oil and yields may only now be getting pushed by an economy that has failed to push them for a decade?  Maybe the balloon is finally expanding?  Some tension in long-dormant areas may be expected.

6709 2018-04-23 09:38:53 The Denmark comparison doesn't stand up to scrutiny. Their population is 5m. Oil revenues are a big part of their economy. Taxes are extremely high. Education & healthcare standards are below average. Ideologically it sounds fine, but it doesn't work particularly well.

6729 2018-04-23 09:33:35 Fuel scarcity abinitio was a sabotage by corrupt cabal to bring the govt down to his knee, also to force govt to increase the pump price. Although there was an increment in the price of crude oil in international mkt, but govt stood his ground to protect local consumers.

6881 2018-04-23 08:58:38 Yes, it is so messed up that Canada imports oil from less respectful countries, rather than develop our own resources. Cause if we developed our own resources, we could better all of Canada. But lack action shows Trudeau doesn’t seem to want that

7207 2018-04-23 07:49:07 The reason Dubai is putting so much money in tech is because they realize that oil is finished. Dubai was already doing that 10 years ago, when people still believed oil would never go below 100 usd again. 1/2
7208 2018-04-23 07:48:56 The keto diet is great for people whit diabetes as it’s obvious that most suggars are in the carbohidrates.
Now the huge difference is to eat natural fats and products that just put you “fats” whit out telling you that it’s a saturated fat.
Also heating oil is the worst thing.

7213 2018-04-23 07:48:01 Yes, have a friend like that. The sad truth is that microwave cooking retains more vitamins, nutrients and minerals than boiling in a pan of water, but the urban legend persists, aided by those "health" sites that want to sell you some snake oil to "strengthen the immune system"

7241 2018-04-23 07:42:01 In 2014 the crude oil price is 40 and now it is 26. About 35% decrease happened. But petrol and Diesel prices are rocketing. If the price is standardised on crude oil price Delhi will get petrol below 50. 15% diesel price increased and 4% in petrol from the year Modi has started.
7242 2018-04-23 07:41:59 @drex @cknw  all of the talking heads who are wrapped up in kinder Morgan seem to have forgotten about keystone excel getting oil to Louisiana & being able to get full market price - when Alberta sells oil to wash state refineries do they get full market price or not ?

7281 2018-04-23 07:33:17 @realDonaldTrump Re Russian troubles, have you reviewed the effect of cutting Russian oil imports to bolster oil prices to justify the Keystone Pipeline?  I think problems were exacerbated by trying to make oil tar sands pay off. Oil exports are 60% of Russian govt revenues.

7302 2018-04-23 07:28:00 ECA is a function of 2 variables: price & quantity. So while price rose in 2017, quantity remained below benchmark, which means conditions for ECA savings haven’t yet kicked in. (Keep in mind there’s a lag between oil sale and receipt of money by FAAC, I think 90 days)

7697 2018-04-23 06:05:30 Oil companies should stick to shelling for oil, not in control of real estate. It's the same old families sticking together and Sean Hannity is using his position as a t.v. personality to be an insider.

If produce majority of oil quantities why take pricing from the Saudi's & Russia. We should set the price since we product more

7815 2018-04-23 05:38:22 I got an email today from Cannabis Oil exactly at 4:20. Love the irony.
7816 2018-04-23 05:38:18 Absolutely! If there are any walgreens or walmart stores in your area, it's very likely that they would be carrying unrefined coconut oil that you can use on your skin. Otherwise, there are pleanty of options to choose from that are available online via google shopping.

Only #PMB has this unbreakable track record among the ruling class. He has overcome the Power of Material things
7818 2018-04-23 05:38:14 OK. Just look at local Semihamoo FN. They support KM twinning & have financial agreement thereto. You oppose KM. Semiahmoo FN sees 110-unit BNSF oil tanker trains thru their lands along foreshore as result of over-subscription of KM. KM twinning would negate that. Square circle.
7819 2018-04-23 05:37:58 It works well even without the oil part. Its a lifesaver when i get cravings on travels to the US. In my m/w about a minute, then i figured i could do 3 at a time, in the same 1 nimit !
7820 2018-04-23 05:37:57 คงกลางๆเดือนแหละ ไปม้ะ???
7821 2018-04-23 05:37:51 Yeah, don’t look into a high performance engine like for example from BMW. They don’t even have oil stick.
7822 2018-04-23 05:37:27 Pretty sure I broke my hand breaking my oil drain plug off last night lmao
7823 2018-04-23 05:37:00 Lemongrass oil, a few yellow candles and some citrine to brighten my mood

7826 2018-04-23 05:36:38 Mix conditioner with oil lot of it and start working girl
7827 2018-04-23 05:36:37 That would be fantastic if only the complacent masses could come together and agree and realize children are honestly our future. However, the bureaucrats have managed to lull the poverty stricken and disenfranchised mid-west into a trance in order to buy the snake oil. Sad
7828 2018-04-23 05:36:32 Peh. Internship media lagi mahai daripada oil and gas.
7829 2018-04-23 05:36:26 a) No, inflation is a complex phenomenon that can also be brought on by scarcity, see the 70s oil crisis, but interests rates and spending are powerful levers. What is your point?
b) Again many factors, but inherited wealth usually comes with inherited investment management.
7830 2018-04-23 05:35:44 persuade your gov. not to finance Suud’s bloody oil money. That’s a step.

7839 2018-04-23 05:34:29 Can't sleep? Use lavender essential oil in your bath. You will sleep like a baby.
7840 2018-04-23 05:34:19 Hmmm......didn't they say that because the government of the time wanted to declare Alberta's oil as Canadian, "in the national interest"?
7841 2018-04-23 05:34:03 I just want to know this: would cooking oil not have worked them too? Is the faith in the oil? In the fact that the pastor ‘blessed’ the oil, or in the God who gives life? I hear them praising the oil, but not once did she say God woke my son from the dead- praise God. Not once.
7842 2018-04-23 05:33:59 @kingsley most youths are lazy that is why theyWere in into yahoo, militants for free money from govt and Oil co,Cultism to Kidnapping/ robbing. PMB is correct.
7843 2018-04-23 05:33:23 speaking of budget effects in other countries that are a result of venezuelan bankruptcy did you know Jamaica got out of IMF hell zone because Venezuela accepted pennies on the dollar of their oil loan debt back from Jamaica last year

7847 2018-04-23 05:32:31 This means big trouble for the petrodollar hegemony in time ,IMHO . Saddam Hussein selling oil in the euro instead of US dollar was the reason for the Iraq war/invasion after all .Look what happened to Muammar al-Gaddafi & the gold backed dinar he started .
7848 2018-04-23 05:32:31 And u believe it was GOD who came down to save the Queen and GOD help build Dubai ?

7866 2018-04-23 05:28:51 You shouldn't just reduce oil extraction without racemate reduction of oil consumption.
7867 2018-04-23 05:28:48 I never thought the day would come that we run out of butter and I have to use oil for my pancakes
7868 2018-04-23 05:28:42 You have to ad : "oil"
7869 2018-04-23 05:28:27 Electric Is Better Than Oil. ! ?
7870 2018-04-23 05:28:27 I wonder if it is "better" as a cooking medium than oil or butter. Some of its champions appear to argue that it is.
7871 2018-04-23 05:28:23 Don't fall for the "you gotta get naked so I can put oil on you" massages. I guarantee if the nicca had on clothes before he started, they're off by the time he's done and you turn around.

7877 2018-04-23 05:27:41 It seems that a lot of L'affaire Trump-Russe seems to be about oil, tech, shady real estate deals and Middle East politics.
7878 2018-04-23 05:26:59 Oil prices hovering close to $70......Is it going higher as some forecast?

7881 2018-04-23 05:25:48 I think it was mentioned that some stages had to be swapped. Like mirage saloon and oil ocean were meant to be swapped so that the train would be coming out of oil ocean zone.

7918 2018-04-23 05:19:30 oil demand increases in teh summer
7919 2018-04-23 05:19:22 As a Bipolar, when you have this condition you will accept anything that might help, rather than nothing. Sadly snake oil salesmen still exist. Whilst all the academic chatter goes on, and people jump on the band wagon of the next break through therapy, I am still trying to live.
7920 2018-04-23 05:19:17 But isn’t the technique of ETF sthg. very natural? For example: grain, oil. As long gold is seen as a commodity, speculation is unavoidable. The change of behavior will not come from a law, but from the collapse of gold's main counterpart: US$. Or?
7921 2018-04-23 05:19:16 オイル、君なら地球を救える。
7922 2018-04-23 05:19:09 But use oil based products as much as possible and not an alternative. Great choice...
7923 2018-04-23 05:19:08 Yep.
This is what @realDonaldTrump and his big oil buddies planned all along.
7924 2018-04-23 05:18:59 That’s a pretty poor containment setup. Are those double walled tanks? Generally around here they need plastic lined around and under the tanks. That would be a pretty big stain if that was holding back oil!
7925 2018-04-23 05:18:55 This is the way to go though a fight will come from the oil cartel @edmnangagwa
7926 2018-04-23 05:18:44 Holy shit @just9n The human body produces oil the fingertips as a part of the immune system. That's a healthy part of life that is not relevant to the Clean/Dirty argument.

7931 2018-04-23 05:18:17 When oil and gas are subsidized, I have to question the market driven theory. What if we even the playing field and subsidize all energy the same way an d give the same tax benefits?  Perhaps we the people would make more environmentally safe decisions
7932 2018-04-23 05:18:03 Nations with energy problems should invest in movie theater nacho cheese. That shit's worth like 50x what oil is by volume.

7946 2018-04-23 05:15:48 I think it will go higher but not as much as they expect at least for the end of the year, because I think in summer the oil demand decreases, maybe if they keep lowering the supply, the prices may skyrocket next year.

4. Put evaporated milk
5. Half or quarter of a block of butter

8092 2018-04-23 04:47:35 In Texas oil field jobs are golden. Most want gas and oil deregulation, but could care less about coal and uranium mining.

8101 2018-04-23 04:45:22 It is great to say you want them, fine, show me how without surpressing growth.  San Francisco/SV is so very wealthy, could not do it?  Oil rich countries provide, small populations with large revenues and issue stipend as well.  Althought third world due to lack of middle class.

8112 2018-04-23 04:42:54 If you're looking at macronutrients you have to consider what's replacing them. Replace butter with canola oil margarine like they did there and you're better off. Plant based MUFA and PUFA is healthier than saturated fat, fiber is carbohydrate. All healthier alternatives to SFA.
8113 2018-04-23 04:42:50 @narendramodi 
Dear Sir,
Please control the oil prices in India. India is still a poor country. Still fresh graduates are earning 5000rs per month. I am not talking about me. I am settled. Dont make people more and more poor. Please change the tax structures.

8119 2018-04-23 04:41:29 Crude oil also comes from Muslim countries. Ask these stupid character to stop using that.

8123 2018-04-23 04:40:34 My skin feels sooo soft. Tanning w/ coconut oil is legit the best. 
8124 2018-04-23 04:40:31 チャーリーさん、どーしたんだろうな…
8125 2018-04-23 04:40:16 As long as the military industrial complex has the leaders by the balls, nothing is going to happen. As long as the oil nations have the leaders by the balls, nothing is going to happen. You can't shame those that have no shame.

8129 2018-04-23 04:39:43 Have you tried making popcorn in a whirly pop?  I've learned that coconut oil in one of those is the secret to making movie theater popcorn.  Also if you use ghee it makes for AMAZING buttered popcorn.
8130 2018-04-23 04:39:40 it's because if you wash it every day with shampoo, your scalp adjusts to being scrubbed that often, and therefore produces more oil, and faster. That's why your hair gets really greaty after a couple of days, because your head is used to being cleaned all the time lol
8131 2018-04-23 04:39:01 No, dear. Trump's doing just great. He's lowering our taxes & trying to drop price of oil - I know you're rich & not bothered by this, but we are. He's bringing back jobs & trying to keep us safe. We'll stick with him.

8136 2018-04-23 04:37:21 Terengganu should not spend all of the oil royalty..shud set it aside in a Heritage Fund.

8142 2018-04-23 04:35:45 US WAR MACHINE IS AT WORK 24/7/365. Operators of this machined never care of lives of US soldiers or those killed, mostly Muslims. Their goal is to make  money through gaining territory, oil & selling arms of US military industrial complex. That is all about  Business!
8143 2018-04-23 04:35:22 Haha yeah that makes it totally ok.   Well nobody in Texas was offended ...a place that is racist to the core built on oil money and worships athletes more than any place on the planet.  Yeah I'm not looking to Texas for sanity and reason.  This ruined a good photo.  He's a clown
8144 2018-04-23 04:35:19 I guess it bears mentioning that I have combo skin, I'm dry and flaky and also hella oily. Idk if oil would help much but I could try
8145 2018-04-23 04:34:49 my parents think coconut oil solves all problems
8146 2018-04-23 04:34:49 And for the bumps, tea tree oil is bomb! After you wash & moisturize, dab a little bit of tea tree oil on the spots & let it sit overnight. You don't have to put it all over, just the spots

8150 2018-04-23 04:33:56 I suggest a hydrating facial wash & an oil free moisturizer. A good face wash is CeraVe hydrating cleanser & a good oil free moisturizer is Pons or Neutrogena's oil free moisturizer with sunscreen. Can get both from Walmart or Target
8151 2018-04-23 04:33:49 Have you used  of oil instead of lotion before?
8152 2018-04-23 04:33:47 Thank you! I’ve been using avocado oil but I’ll start using both

8230 2018-04-23 04:20:58 Sure wish these Geniuses would figure out a way to save our planet from climate change. And clean our oceans and get us off plastic and oil.

8232 2018-04-23 04:20:38 Fact: I have been religiously oil cleansing with a myriad of cleansers since 2015 and approximately zero have left my skin glowing. #fakenews 
8233 2018-04-23 04:20:22 In all seriousness, I recommend eating more nuts/nut butters, avocado, starchy veggies (Corn, peas, tatoes), add 1tbsp olive oil to smoothies, drink juices/milk over water, of course you can add an unhealthy snack every once in a while

8235 2018-04-23 04:20:18 Could it be that Canada is at the bottom of the list and Saudi Arabia is at the top because we keep buying their oil at a premium rather than using our own at a discount? No, I am sure it can't be that simple ... @jkenney @scheer @MaximeBernier @PierrePoilievre

8244 2018-04-23 04:18:22 Haha smart choice! I think I only owe $80 on mine but I’m going to pay it off next week lol and the kora oil is like the maracuja oil. I had ran out of my maracuja and I’ve always heard good things about the kora one so I decided to try it and I like it!

8248 2018-04-23 04:18:18 That’s because Alberta knows that the money it gets from the corporate taxes and the employee income taxes from the oil industry are enormous. 

There are many ways a government gets its money. Royalties are just one.
8249 2018-04-23 04:17:52 But once we did that then we'd be able to drive straight through to Alaska and have access to new gold and oil fields, making new jobs and encouraging the pioneer spirit that made us great.

8252 2018-04-23 04:17:23 Is that oil or water that you cook that in? Does it get messy around the bowl or stay contained?
8253 2018-04-23 04:17:21 Change your name to Friends of Oil and Coal. You ignore science.
8254 2018-04-23 04:16:41 It increased because butter was replaced with a canola oil based margarine provided for free to experimental group. Whole fat milk, cheese etc were to be replaced by oils. Red meat was limited and fruit daily. The margarine was rich in N-3 due to the canola oil.
8255 2018-04-23 04:16:01 $EMP Mid point trades seeing supply being bought.  Cheap Oil and Gas shell. $EMPOC have expiry march 2020, so will provide plenty of leverage for entry.
8256 2018-04-23 04:15:42 Well all canadians would benefit from the pipeline. As I am writing this message BC is at a record high for oil prices and they are starving for Alberta oil. Its a vital and necessary project we must undertake to maintain a strong canadian economy.
8257 2018-04-23 04:15:36 And where do you think Britain explored oil at at one time? Iran the British had oil interest in Iran.
8258 2018-04-23 04:15:24 Nice!! I wanted to order it but didn’t want to wait for it to arrive lol plus i’m trying to stay away from ulta until i pay my credit card off  what is the kora oil? I don’t think i’ve heard of it
8259 2018-04-23 04:15:05 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
8260 2018-04-23 04:15:00 I haven’t, I will try it though! thanks for the suggestion! I think the vitamin E oil was just too thick for my undereyes. can you tell me how almond oil compares?
8261 2018-04-23 04:15:00 I have been using the Tajin Clasico seasoning. Potato chips are my last treat do I try to make them as healthy as possible! Well I try to convince myself. I mean: olive oil!
8262 2018-04-23 04:14:54 So my uncle mistook dishwasher liquid as cooking oil so he bought us food from McDonald's instead 
8263 2018-04-23 04:14:36 W#hat is the preferred oil to use? I was just about to ask @kenjilopezalt this same ? as I remember him saying flax (despite a popular article) wasn't the best. I have 8 pans to restore for a friend and don't want the#m chipping. Thanks, gents.

8282 2018-04-23 04:11:38 The pathetic thing is that @JustinTrudeau does not realize that,unlike @BarackObama ,he will not be able to survive this BP oil spill and get a 2nd term because ,also unlike Obama, he has had ample warning that this is a bad idea, and he doesn't even seem to care it's a bad idea.
8283 2018-04-23 04:11:18 Vegetable oil called that because it actually works well for cooking vegetables?

8297 2018-04-23 04:09:44 I want palm oil tree ; more shady 
8298 2018-04-23 04:09:11 The economy cannot thrive without the pipeline, even though this is unfortunate it dosen't mean we shouldint look for alternative forms of energy while using the pipeline. At the current state we rely too much on oil and without it we could lose our economys competitive edge.
8299 2018-04-23 04:09:05 I’d be careful w vitamin E oil underneath the eyes though - it gave me itty bitty milia that took about 5 days to disappear (stopped using it before it got worse, as soon as I noticed), but that also might just be my skin :(
8300 2018-04-23 04:09:02 i want to cook and clean but i know for a fact that if this stupid worthless giant fly doesn’t die before i start it will try to fly in  my face and in the oil when i really cannot afford to go after it because that’s just how life works
8301 2018-04-23 04:08:43 it's clear you dont have brain nor able to read news how much black money recovered. modi will bring fuel in get them it will come down now bringing down 3 lac cr debt of oil companies left by  congress. u cannot understand this your head is empty
8302 2018-04-23 04:08:33 I am all for cheaper and more efficient energy, and a govt tax won't help with this, it will only hurt low income families. If an energy source can be as cheap and efficient as oil or coal and produce less waste then consumers will embrace it.
8303 2018-04-23 04:08:33 I am downcast and have great trepidition this #EarthDay because the con man who sits in the White House doesn't believe in climate change or global warming. He's rolling back regulations left and right and selling off oil drilling rights in protected lands.
8304 2018-04-23 04:08:18 David Axelrod, from Obama's days?  That administration built >10,000 miles of oil+gas pipe, ramped up oil exports, built their LNG exports and managed to hammer the CDN oil industry so that we'd be forced to sell USA our oil cheap.  We're the idiots and they played us for fools.
8305 2018-04-23 04:08:13 Scroll down and you'll see a chart showing electricity generation by type.  Oil is negligible.  Coal is still big but losing share to NatGas.

8308 2018-04-23 04:08:00 If Westworld gets woke you can at least watch all five seasons of Person of Interest on Netflix.  Honestly I think Jonah Nolan set the high bar with PoI and has yet to match it with Westworld.

8318 2018-04-23 04:05:10 Emily, i actually like his answer, he is correct, the manure will be replaced when better solutions are available, like burning wood and whale blubber was replaced by oil for energy.  I know it is kind of wonky, but it is true.

8360 2018-04-23 03:58:33 Why don't you ask your Muslim brothers in Saudi, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait to take more Syrian refugees? Same religion, language, culture. Relatively safe, stable countries. Plenty of oil money to support incoming refugees with.

8363 2018-04-23 03:57:50 Russia wants all the ice to melt so he can get his ships with oil through cheaper.  How long do you think our planet can survive all the GREED in this world?

8370 2018-04-23 03:57:08 I’ve started to rethink the issue of term limits after watching a senator who, rumor has it, doesn’t intend to run again. As far as I can tell, he’s only listening to oil & gas industry (possibly to get a cushy private sector job?) Which goes back to Citizen’s United maybe?
8371 2018-04-23 03:57:00 And what they include vs not is odd. They send milk and flour but not olive oil or cream cheese. I definately have the 1st 2 on hand more than the 2nd.
8372 2018-04-23 03:56:40 How, by exporting more oil at an even higher margin? #StopKM #EarthDay cc: @JustinTrudeau

8383 2018-04-23 03:54:56 Mr. Sohi, the Port of Vancouver records show only 600 barrels of oil were shipped to Asia last year. Kinder Morgan is playing us to get the Canadians to fund the project so they can ship to California. They will not get a better price in California or anywhere else in the world

8397 2018-04-23 03:52:18 That's awesome feedback. Thank you! I work with Photoshop + ink most often. It might be different from what you're up to, but there are MANY transferrable skills between mediums. That's a big reason why it was easy for me to transition to digital after 4 years oil painting!
8398 2018-04-23 03:52:12 No I just improvised. The mix is simple all you need is a 1/4 cup melted butter or coconut oil, 1 large egg, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract. I used a one ounce scoop to portion them and made thumb prints with half of them. Sugar-free jam in half chocolate squares in the other
8399 2018-04-23 03:51:58 Not too much in Oregon but it's spreading like an oil spill.

8402 2018-04-23 03:51:49 the stock market is crashing, oil prices rising, deficit has ballooned. at 20% faster than Obama, Plus Trump submitted our sovereignty to Putin.  Trump has is support for the klan, so that must be what you like.  If you hate our constitution, you and Trump can move to Russia.
8403 2018-04-23 03:51:40 60% of the population are youths below 30, most are not educated and believe they should get everything free since Nigeria is an oil producing nation. 
Explain? Doesn’t it sound like an illiterate calling us illiterates and lazy at the same time?

8413 2018-04-23 03:50:45 Seismic testing involves "blasts" as does tunneling through rock. Chopping down and Digging up trees, laying damming material in rivers too apparently. If any of it leaks contaminating the soil and any water source.Mean if we absolutely need oil rather have water or land not both
8414 2018-04-23 03:50:28 Tea tree oil is one of the best things I’ve ever done for my face, on god
8415 2018-04-23 03:50:27 Fox News would be richer and more powerful than oil companies if that were the case. Not sure that's a good tradeoff.
8416 2018-04-23 03:50:25 Or canola oil if coco butter is too black for her
8417 2018-04-23 03:50:21 My uncle did most of the drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. He was always in charge. They went thousands of feet down for just oil. So, to have melted rock, you have to go way further down. No large of pools of magma is near the surface. Only tubes of it. To cold.

8435 2018-04-23 03:48:07 8. In our case, meanwhile, I don't think the government has any intention to shift its attention to the renewable energy. Do you? It's always been oil full steam ahead rain or shine. Therefore, what interests that collide?

8503 2018-04-23 03:36:48 But oil spills are ok right?
8504 2018-04-23 03:36:39 That's right, and after we use that oil we should dump it right back onto the ground so it can be drilled for again.  It's called recycling.
8505 2018-04-23 03:36:24 I stopped using coconut oil as makeup remover about a week ago, my acne has noticeably lessened.... WHY COCONUT OIL WHY???? ALL IVE EVER DONE IS LOVED AND SUPPORTED YOU!! WHY YOU DOING ME SO DIRTY???
8506 2018-04-23 03:36:21 bought an essential oil called happiness and my problems still exist :((( how dare
8507 2018-04-23 03:35:52 also sis the acne stress control from neutrogena or any of their “power cream” washes are great for dry skin! and vitamin e or almond oil!!!
8508 2018-04-23 03:35:35 What up? Take a look at #California! @JerryBrownGov allows #fracking; oil drilling; Unregulated air particulates (leafblowers; VOC's; smokers); #IllegalImmigration causing #environmental issues & denuding of parks by cities; counties HOA's & property owners. #EarthDay @AP

8522 2018-04-23 03:33:51 I've been using cannabis oil since last summer. I've been able to reduce the anti depressants by 50%.
8523 2018-04-23 03:33:46 You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it

8530 2018-04-23 03:31:58 3. In the meantime, since oil is still abundant, the against-the-goverment's-effort-to-reduce-traffic ruling class who live in Jakarta satellite cities like Bekasi can start using public transportation from now on.
8531 2018-04-23 03:31:58 Yet the @CPC_HQ shut down a marine response center in Vancouver. Also, There has not been enough preparation for an oil spill by the federal government. Increased oil tankers increase the chances of an oil spill on the scale of Exxon Valdez. #StopKM #ProtectTheInlet #cdnpoli
8532 2018-04-23 03:31:39 In today's QP you said pipelines are safer than trains for oil.  But BC is against #dilbit not oil. Oil can explode in a train crash -bitumen can't. Oil can be cleaned up. Dilbit, probably, can not. @ElizabethMay is on record supporting moving #bitumen by train.  Accuracy please!
8533 2018-04-23 03:31:29 @LastWeekTonight Another reason why the CIA disposed of Mossadegh in favor of the Shah: the oil industry.  Stay tuned for more of the Iran Deal on #LastWeekTonight

8535 2018-04-23 03:31:13 Here’s a question we should all be asking: Since when is it the Finance Minister’s job to use our tax dollars to lure investors to an American Oil Company?

8547 2018-04-23 03:29:39 i tried a different oil cleanser in japan but despite the good reviews it was thick and it broke me out like crazy. now i'm kind of scared to try out others, but if there's one out there that's even better (maybe cheaper) i'd be down to try for sure.
8548 2018-04-23 03:29:34 what's the squirt to oil ratio on those 10 gallons?
8549 2018-04-23 03:29:33 Lol he really tried. He’s just a little more susceptible to snake oil pitches that I am. I had to remove the shopping channel from our cable package

8551 2018-04-23 03:29:26 2...like a harridan toward the government's plan to intervene in oil prices even during these two political years only. On the other hand, if exploration in giant fields remain in limbo, why should our gas reserves drop in years to come? Where does it go?

Rainforests, which have about 50% of all life on earth, are disappearing
Our coral reefs are dying

8557 2018-04-23 03:28:46 A century of Orientalism, Japan being told to stay on their islands watching Manifest Destiny and European imperialism play out.  The US choking off their oil supply.  US killing the 1911 trade agreement in 1939, condemning Nanking, Export Control Act changes. Take your pick

8562 2018-04-23 03:28:13 You have no argument other than Trump's tweets. He lies to you,  because of him this country is losing allies, losing trade pacts, the economy will go down the tubes, you will be unemployed. You claim MAGA. USA has always been great. But you believe in snake oil.

8566 2018-04-23 03:27:14 bro i love my oil cleanser. I've only really tried the manila zero one but it worked so well for me that I didn't bother trying more. I don't really have to remove any makeup so that's not super important, but when i just do a foam cleanser my face just doesn't feel clean.
8567 2018-04-23 03:26:51 never tried honey. I just add coffee, coconut milk, and tea tree oil and my skin has been looking amazing!
8568 2018-04-23 03:26:47 The thing that's genuinely scaring me is that I don't think a lot of these guys are snake oil salesmen... some of them seem to have reeeeaally swallowed the propaganda whole.

8570 2018-04-23 03:26:31 1.

8573 2018-04-23 03:26:20 TO REMOVE WHITE SPOTS FROM FURNITURE, rub first with oil, however is still destroying it daily.
8574 2018-04-23 03:26:01 I think it's funny how Oregon fans call Taggart a snake oil salesman. What exactly is Cristobal selling? There is no logical argument someone can make to choose to play for Cristobal over Petersen, Shaw, or Kelly in my opinion.
8575 2018-04-23 03:25:54 ฉู้ๆๆๆๆ
8576 2018-04-23 03:25:51 I had pizza for dinner. Yes there was oil on it, no it doesn't scare me. My food had a quantifiable amount of one of the ingredients of my food...in it....hmmm

8583 2018-04-23 03:24:53 Apply almond oil around the mouth to keep your lips supple and soften the lines.
8584 2018-04-23 03:24:41 the biggest fight me and evelyn ever got into was about olive oil
8585 2018-04-23 03:24:39 I use Cantu shea butter, I love their products, the leave in conditioner specifically. A mix of almond (or whatever I have at the moment) and peppermint oil on my scalp and hair to seal in moisture. I wash it every week and thats it really
8586 2018-04-23 03:24:36 When I finish deh with you self you go even learn how to make oil down
8587 2018-04-23 03:24:35 People who hate muslims pls use gau mutra for ur vehicles instead of petrol as u know oil comes from Muslim countries. Take ur hatred to next level and ride on bicycles in this way u will also help environment.

8652 2018-04-23 03:15:00 I disagree.  It was a good idea maybe 25 years ago, if you don't care about climate change or oil spills.  Now it's off the table--we have obligations under the Paris climate agreement.  We have a climate crisis.
8653 2018-04-23 03:14:57 Because they would cut into all of the oil tycoons profits. They do not want safe and cheap they want money.

8705 2018-04-23 03:07:45 @Jami_USA  So she's implying that conservatism is something that needs to be apologized for... nice sentiment for your fans, Shania (since it's mostly conservatives who listen to country music). She shouldn't have apologized, plain and simple.

8707 2018-04-23 03:07:23 It is in the states best interest to landlock Canadian oil while they're undergoing a shale boom. It's possible KM is getting shareholder pressure to put their money elsewhere.

8747 2018-04-23 03:01:39 Where did you read that? Last I checked, the purpose of the pipeline is to EXPORT to Asia, not prevent the import. And the largest supplier of oil to Canada is Saudi Arabia. Both Canada and China produce the same amount of oil so....

8754 2018-04-23 03:00:49 Retail fuel prices are high. A benchmark for crude oil, last week hit US$ 75 a barrel, the highest since Nov 2014. It has been easier for policy makers to keep fiscal deficits under control. Therefore, a change in the price spells a challenging phase for the government #lka

8775 2018-04-23 02:57:38 It's in the Bible. Just as the Bible clearly says to strip Earth clean of gas, oil and coal, it says that the guy in charge of "harvesting" must have a soundproof booth for his private conversations with God. (Lunatic 3:24-49)
8776 2018-04-23 02:57:38 Lance:  I'm under your skin. 

LeBron: The only things under my skin are oil glands, hair bulbs, nerve fibers, blood vessels, and a bit of fatty tissue. 

Lance: You forgot about Ruffini's corpuscle. Hahahaha. Oh my god. You’re rattled. Checkmate.
8777 2018-04-23 02:57:11 As in after dead week? Bc this weekend I’m at OIL all week this week 
8778 2018-04-23 02:57:06 im oily/dehydrated!!! i like slathering my face at night so i think an oil would go nicely w this ...  & im w u on the ingredients, thats why i wana try it too ... ive never tried any de products before !
8779 2018-04-23 02:56:49 But actually... come to think of it, since it is Mother Earth, it makes perfect sense that all the Republicans want to do is lay claim to her insides. Especially her oil and coal. This really makes so much sense.
8780 2018-04-23 02:56:47 @oilfractals is your pw working for the notebook for the weekly plan?
8781 2018-04-23 02:56:20 I just bought some argan oil soo this better do wonders

8786 2018-04-23 02:55:54 Oil that shit up and stop playing.
8787 2018-04-23 02:55:41 Hello sir, so do OMC’s get the full right to manipulate oil prices?
8788 2018-04-23 02:55:37 My sister gave me this vape juice that says gushers but taste like engine oil
8789 2018-04-23 02:55:30 Wow. @SierraClub endorses ass kisser of Oil Pipelines.
8790 2018-04-23 02:55:19 おっはこんにちはー(・∞・)
週末は暑かったですね〜
きょうはまた涼しく…この気温差にやられたようで鼻がグスグスしています。皆さんも疲れすぎないようにマイペースですだYo〜
8791 2018-04-23 02:55:15 The longer the big parties dig their heels in, break climate change promises and give into oil industry memes the faster we have to take more radical actions to help the climate.  What we've lost is time.
8792 2018-04-23 02:54:27 Boat
8793 2018-04-23 02:54:27 Well right now it is the West causing  havoc..with this oil.
8794 2018-04-23 02:54:00 I'm so irritated
8795 2018-04-23 02:53:28 Washing the meat before you cook it is sooo unnecessary. What germs surviving in scolding hot oil 
8796 2018-04-23 02:53:27 today dillan & his dad changed my oil & put a new tire on my car & i couldn’t be more thankful for him & his family
8797 2018-04-23 02:53:27 anyone who tells you coconut oil is good for your skin hates you
8798 2018-04-23 02:53:08 @ColinCowherd has crowned Ben Simmons already but to quote the great Bill Parcells, "Put away the anointing oil." His time is coming but not yet. #NBAPlayoffs2018
8799 2018-04-23 02:53:06 The whole reason you’re in the Middle East is because of oil, drugs and money, nothing else. You’ve never liked the Arabs or the Muslims. You have no reason to. And don’t pretend you do. It’s embarrassing. You westerners have always had deep seeded hatred for the Middle East.
8800 2018-04-23 02:52:50 Well this kills Pierre Andurand's argument of not enough CAPEX causing US oil production to stop. Nothing can stop US oil production now. Russians, Saudis, Madani can all push whatever story they want, or do as much theater as they want, but US oil production is here!
8801 2018-04-23 02:52:38 The shelf life of sweet almond oil is only about 6 months - 1 year. It may go rancid if you don’t use the entire gallon in that time frame.
8802 2018-04-23 02:52:33 Jamaican black castor oil >
8803 2018-04-23 02:52:29 Tea tree oil
8804 2018-04-23 02:52:08 YES! I still sell CBD oil. 
8805 2018-04-23 02:51:54 Well what's the Q-tip being used for? Is it being used to clean the oil off of a small animal? I see it being useful, there.
8806 2018-04-23 02:51:23 I know! I would only have the spoons of oil on a dare vs, pizza, Which is tasty
8807 2018-04-23 02:50:58 Get those rigs pumping  oil rigs are coming to s coast near you Dianne 
8808 2018-04-23 02:50:54 Ik he does, he has done that to some of my tweets in the past before too lol, which is why I like to bust on him too if i get a chance... after all Lucas Oil latemodels were at port and u and I were watching sprint cars at Selinsgrove... #sprintcars>latemodels
8809 2018-04-23 02:50:45 oilの民にやっぱりなりたいので頑張ってなろうかしら
8810 2018-04-23 02:50:09 Get some bio oil!! At like Walmart or Walgreens, it will help keep them away and if you do get them, help them fade!!
8811 2018-04-23 02:50:08 slicker than an oil spill 
8812 2018-04-23 02:50:06 Looking back, he made a smart choice to keep interest rates low.  The headwinds are getting stronger due to the oil politics, the Trump effect and much more. Folks,  trouble is on the horizon.
8813 2018-04-23 02:50:03 Félicitation,  madame Butoyi. Nous sommes heureux d' entendre votre determination pour l' avenir du pays
8814 2018-04-23 02:50:00 Ogx Shampoo and conditioner products work really good with getting all the oil out of your hair extensions
8815 2018-04-23 02:49:34 i swear there's nothing more stupid than latines defending the imperialist machine that is the us they HATE US GUYS. THEY DONT CARE FOR YOUR ASS, THEY JUST WANT THE OIL AND WATER
8816 2018-04-23 02:49:17 Lemme get some of that beard oil
8817 2018-04-23 02:49:16 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
8818 2018-04-23 02:49:12 i love this time of year bc its the time of year mum always looks at my arm, tuts, and goes "sure you dont want to put some bio oil on those?"
8819 2018-04-23 02:49:07 Eggs and oil lmao
8820 2018-04-23 02:48:33 Nice Hot oil bubble bath
8821 2018-04-23 02:48:23 If you don’t use @doterra lavender oil to help you sleep at night id maybe rethink your entire life. #goodnight
8822 2018-04-23 02:48:12 If it contains water(jam, salsa) and is sealed (eg glass jar) it can go in the cupboard until opened. If it contains oil (eg peanut butter) then usually not unless you want it cold.
8823 2018-04-23 02:48:07 cos ..in Syria..they have his oil that Israel unlawfully granted the lease on..in Venezuela.. sort of the same...tho we're not bombing them..yet..tho sanctions are a weapon..
n NK ? who can say ? 
8824 2018-04-23 02:48:07 Hot oil, low flames
8825 2018-04-23 02:48:04 By buying oil from other countries huh. Democrats are such idiots.
8826 2018-04-23 02:48:02 It makes perfect sense to try to hurt US oil production.
8827 2018-04-23 02:47:57 This almond oil has been doing wonders to my skin . I need a big bottle of it . Amazon has a gallon for $46 . Should I get it ?
8828 2018-04-23 02:47:53 data is the new oil
8829 2018-04-23 02:47:48 that oil not you. 
8830 2018-04-23 02:47:47 Kevin Love's defense is as effective as a q-tip in an oil spill.
8831 2018-04-23 02:47:35 (+) OIL: ราคาน้ำมันดิบวานนี้ WTI +0.13% สู่ $68.38/bbl / BRT +0.38% สู่ $74.06/bbl #โนมูระ

8834 2018-04-23 02:46:59 Oh wow I had that and didn't know it had a different name! I was always slathering baby oil or coconut oil on my eyelids bc flaking eyelids is SO UNCOMFORTABLE AND AWFUL
8835 2018-04-23 02:46:46 Apples to oranges, I'm about to go drop some catfish in the oil
8836 2018-04-23 02:46:32 Doing my own oil change & changing my brakes  tmrw then chilling
8837 2018-04-23 02:45:54 On this earth day let us remember that in 1938 in St. Louis, Baltimore, Los Angeles, and Oakland, Firestone Rubber, Standard Oil, and General electric bought out public trainsit rail systems and replaced them with environmentally damaging and less punctual busses to make a buck

8839 2018-04-23 02:45:49 i just got coconut oil in my eye and i can’t see now 
8840 2018-04-23 02:45:31 @WendyMesleyCBC
It is NOT oil; it is diluted bitumen, and it cannot be cleaned up when spilled in a marine environment.  Everything else is a strawman; the economics, the $6B OP plan, nothing else matters.
8841 2018-04-23 02:45:17 Check your Engine oil this morning.

8845 2018-04-23 02:44:55 CharNelle Jones, we are so proud of you!!! You rocked it and operated in an oil that is authentically yours!
8846 2018-04-23 02:44:46 + stop consuming products with palm oil for both environmental and health sake, don’t buy so much of what you don’t need. I can agree with vegans on most things, humans are greedy and there are always things meat eaters can still do, we can all work together instead of chastising

8848 2018-04-23 02:44:36 You're so dumb. 

It would easy for beer, wine, milk or oil to cross pronvincal borders ILLEGALLY like said illegal immigrants you're whining about. 

Seriously, can't you do better than this? #ableg
8849 2018-04-23 02:44:36 I believe that Mr. Malamud would tell you that things still turned out OK for the KHL. Ak Bars Kazan is the non-Moscow-or-St.-Petersburg juggernaut financially. They're sponsored by the government of Tatarstan and its biggest oil company, Tatneft.
8850 2018-04-23 02:44:34 For sure, in seed oil, rich in Omega-6s.
8851 2018-04-23 02:44:34 Haven’t we heard that for years?  All the conspiracy theories, all the “Clinton crime family” BS All the partisan investigations and nothing..but the dirt is coming now?  And then they defend a POS like Trump?  That snake oil must be amazing

Dear summer,
8854 2018-04-23 02:43:51 Oil Spill 
8855 2018-04-23 02:43:42 It is indeed. Lost paternal grandma to it, devastating to see her, a poet, writer, educator, lifetime activist, just waste away. 
Maternal gradmother has had it for 10 yrs, somehow it stopped progressing, some of it even reversed. Mix of meds, fish oil, healthy diet.

8858 2018-04-23 02:43:18 I know that you're trying to stay positive but in 2009 we started burning oil at a rate of 1990's entire year every 2 days.  That's 180 times more oil being burnt yearly as compared to 1990 starting in 2009.  I strongly believe that those numbers have increased in severity.
8859 2018-04-23 02:43:17 This is what people said when we moved from Poind based oil contract to dollar based#

8886 2018-04-23 02:38:53 Can’t recall any PM de facto/spouse in any Western country,  bar Margaret Trudeau, who had such a high profile. Even when he tweeted his admiration for Ardern (the oil and gas stance)  he accompanied it with  a shot of self. Kiwis hate skites/ he’s heading into that realm
8887 2018-04-23 02:38:37 Good luck tomorrow!  I wished we could have stayed over for tomorrow
8888 2018-04-23 02:38:18 Cuomo will do anything to satisfy the demands of the liberal left who are his constituents.  By banning the practice of fracking he supports both the left in the US and the militant socialists in Russia who are selling their oil world wide. His government days are ending.

8895 2018-04-23 02:37:13 Mike.  I don’t think that shopping malls use oil fired furnaces. My guess is coal burning plants  for electricity and natural gas for heat and air conditioning.  Oil doesn’t even figure into it. When were you born yesterday?

8900 2018-04-23 02:36:27 Too right. I often think in 200 years they'll be saying "they did what for energy?!" Like we do now about how whales used to be killed for lamp oil. This is now crazy to us.
8901 2018-04-23 02:36:27 Michelle Obama got it.
Fat dinos don't want hc & studies that show the causes of bad health, high costs.
Sicko fat kleptocrats with their bad food, poison water, plastic hurting, killing fish & birds.
Stupid pesticides, Monsanto morons. Oil drilling, mining, frucking fossils!
8902 2018-04-23 02:36:25 Let me guess....By denying the existence of Global Warming and Climate Change? By celebrating coal? By encouraging nations to open fragile ecosystems to oil drilling (Alaska...)?  Or maybe by urging nations around the world to roll back environmental protection regulations?
8903 2018-04-23 02:36:17 Would just running it though the self cleaning cycle in the oven do the trick?  I learned my lesson with too much oil on my cast iron. Stripped that in the oven, reseasoned using your method and it’s been fantastic.
8904 2018-04-23 02:36:14 This product is not cbd oil. Diamond cbd as advertised has been killing kids in Georgia and North Carolina. STAY THE FUCK AWAY

8907 2018-04-23 02:35:28 But he still keeps giving our money away like there is an bottomless pit.  Millions for every hand that is out, except for Canadians.  Millions for the G7 summit.  Nothing for oil sands, nothing for pipe lines, nothing for Veterans.
8908 2018-04-23 02:35:12 big oil, big pharma, big tv stations, big banks,  all of it, all over the world, can be traced to the same thing, theres seven companies that run shit, seven companies give us the illusion of choice with their hundreds of smaller companies...

8917 2018-04-23 02:34:32 I need like a matte lipstick melt off formula with lots of oil in it to help break it up, and then just wipe it off... do they have that?
8918 2018-04-23 02:34:18 This is the NIMBY mentality ...but when prices jump up at the pump because we are so dependent on foreign oil, we better not hear any complaining from the same NIMBY promoters.

8921 2018-04-23 02:34:10 Hennessy & baby oil for yo bitch 
8922 2018-04-23 02:34:09 With the pipeline bottle necks currently they expect oil by rail to increase to 600000 bpd in the near future. So much safer right.
8923 2018-04-23 02:34:04 Boost body lotion with baby oil If you?re craving shiny legs that aren?t greasy.
8924 2018-04-23 02:33:38 Whats CBD oil?

8926 2018-04-23 02:33:03 You know it’s hawt when the coconut oil is clear!
8927 2018-04-23 02:32:47 Who will they sell their oil to? Do we think China or Russia would have created a paradise in the ME?
8928 2018-04-23 02:32:33 BHA + clay mask + AHA + lots of moisture + rosehip seed oil = waking up looking brighter than the sun 
8929 2018-04-23 02:32:33 wow you crazy lol but try almond oil!
8930 2018-04-23 02:32:22 Just like clockwork, I used to change the oil in my car every earth day.
8931 2018-04-23 02:32:15 How am I wrong? HRC had Wall Street $$, banker money, big oil and gas money.

8933 2018-04-23 02:32:05 Yes!!!! Joico revitalux! Any mask works better if you either apply heat or you sleep in it and wash it out in the morning. Also for the mean time try coconut oil!

8937 2018-04-23 02:31:14 So I’m going to try some supplements for ADD/ADHD, and see how they work.

NAC
ZMA
Fish Oil/Omega 3
Vitamin D
Ginko Baloba

Some people suggest trying to up dopamine and mimic a stimulant, I’m going to try the opposite approach first
8938 2018-04-23 02:31:07 So listen...

I put shimmer lotion all over by body today and topped it all off with baby oil. 

I’m shining bright like a diamond

8941 2018-04-23 02:30:59 @namd4kids I am so tired of everyone sending GeneSight for ADHD medication guidance when there is no good research that it helps...at all! So much money going to snake oil. Help me to understand. Are the free lunches so good that we just buy into it?
8942 2018-04-23 02:30:55 Highly recommend CBD oil or hemp oil to anyone with anxiety!!!
8943 2018-04-23 02:30:44 looking forward to May bills - college tuition, grad ball dress, grad fee, car insurance, car change oil - goodluck ha! #whentheuniverseisconspiringagainstyou

8947 2018-04-23 02:30:03 I put so much oil in Luke’s hair lol I didn’t mean to. He’s sleeping on my chest but his hair is touching my cheek and now it’s all soft 
8948 2018-04-23 02:29:44 I ended up with like 3 lipsticks that are all nearly the same shade and some cleansing oil  I suck at branching out
8949 2018-04-23 02:29:39 Get a guy na marunong magluto (of course using Magnolia nutri oil) para hindi ka magutom. Ipagluluto ka nyan ng adobo (from Monterey syempre pa) with foie gras.
8950 2018-04-23 02:29:35 Yes, Canadians hate him!  I wish more of us did.  A shame that so many of our fellow Americans bought his snake oil.  And even though it's not working they are still drinking it and insisting it is!  Brilliant.
8951 2018-04-23 02:29:24 Big oil and Saudis always play this game.

8953 2018-04-23 02:28:41 Gonna try the coconut oil and olive oil mix and see wa can gwaan
8954 2018-04-23 02:28:24 If there’s one thing I see people consistently get wrong when seasoning cast iron and carbon steel, it’s applying too much oil per layer of seasoning. The pan should *not* look oily at all. Buff it DRY. You need a micro-thin layer, almost imperceptible, otherwise trouble awaits.
8955 2018-04-23 02:28:18 eggplant, peppers, broccoli, cauliflower and greens, all sautéed in coconut oil (don’t be scared of oil, I have a lot!) and with turmeric, paprika, cumin and Himalayan salt.
8956 2018-04-23 02:28:17 We pushed thru every hurdle known to man and got both engines fired. I’m done. Out of gas. And still a lot to do tomorrow. Glad to hear them run. Port engine needs an oil line made in the am. Then a lot of little punch items. Been up since 4. Time to crash!
8957 2018-04-23 02:28:03 To achieve shiny locks, try rubbing a little olive oil in your hair after it is dry.
8958 2018-04-23 02:27:57 24. To maintain knives - After washing thoroughly with water and soap, wipe the blades well and then use a small amount of olive oil and gently rub it on the blades with a towel.

25. Prevent wax from building up on candlesticks - Just pour a bit of olive oil and it won't stick.
8959 2018-04-23 02:27:47 I use baby oil gel. My spouses & various other folks love touching my skin
8960 2018-04-23 02:27:30 22. To prevent squeaks - Smear some olive oil on screaming hinges to make them silent.

23. For digestive problems - Swallow a spoon of olive oil every morning on an empty stomach. Another option is to drink a glass of water with a spoon of olive oil and a spoon of lemon juice.

8962 2018-04-23 02:27:26 I stopped using palm oil years ago! I didn't know that sustainable (and fair!) alternatives were available. Thank you.
8963 2018-04-23 02:27:25 Use a GOOD beard oil. Trim to even it out weekly. Know when it's too long, and cut it back. Shave clean the edge ares where it gets patchy. Make sure it's it's symmetrical. I dunno.
8964 2018-04-23 02:27:15 Bloomberg sells BS on his networks. All the analyst make BS predictions that most of the time don't come true. BS is not a business, more like a jewish snake oil salesman!

8967 2018-04-23 02:26:54 Clinton's brother stole mineral rights for 9 years..BECAUS there is gold and oil...
8968 2018-04-23 02:26:49 18. To treat swollen / red gums - Wash your mouth with a mix of olive oil and water. 

19. Prevent diaper rash - Mix 2 spoons of olive oil with a spoon of water and smear on the baby's rear.
8969 2018-04-23 02:26:38 The thing I see people get wrong over and over is misunderstanding just how little oil you need per layer of seasoning. The pan should be oiled, then buffed dry to the point of seeming not to have any oil left on it at all. Otherwise you’ll get sticky beading and streaks.
8970 2018-04-23 02:26:29 Lol get those walking shoes on champion.....because even Hindu petrol, is sourced from....wait for it.....Muslim oil wells 
8971 2018-04-23 02:26:25 16. To remove Mascara - Pour a bit of olive oil on a cotton ball and wipe the makeup from your eyes.
17. To relieve Coughing - Swallow a spoon of olive oil mixed with a spoon of honey. Another option is to massage the upper back and chest with olive oil at body temperature.
8972 2018-04-23 02:26:09 Yes, let’s stop all that drilling and buy our oil from countries that don’t like us and support terrorists. Besides, we don’t need those high paying jobs when we Democrats can give you welfare for life.
8973 2018-04-23 02:25:56 15. To relieve toothache - Mix drops of clove oil with drops of olive oil, in about a ratio of 3:1, and use a cotton ball to put on the aching area. Not recommended for children and pregnant or breastfeeding women.
8974 2018-04-23 02:25:53 Eucalyptus essential oil in the diffuser and I’ll be out like a light in no time .
8975 2018-04-23 02:25:47 Ima just let this coconut oil sit in my hair until my hair hair comes
8976 2018-04-23 02:25:46 Avocado oil please
8977 2018-04-23 02:25:37 You can use gel or latex and wash it off with olive oil the same day. Just be very very careful of your baby hairs in the front. Never pull off the unit 
8978 2018-04-23 02:25:32 Ah, I see. You can always strip with oven cleaner (be careful, it’s aerosolized lye and will burn your skin on contact), or just scrub it real well with a steel scrubber. There’s not too much on there. Then you want to do just oil in imperceptibly thin layers.
8979 2018-04-23 02:25:26 then wash with cool or luke-warm water. It's recommended to repeat this 3 times a week. 
14. To treat lice - Mix one tablespoon of olive oil with 5 drops of the tea tree oil, and smear on the scalp for several minutes. Then comb your hair with a lice comb and wash with hot water
8980 2018-04-23 02:25:11 The baby oil/Vaseline combo after the night shower is undefeated. I be looking like a piece of aluminum foil, but my skinnnn. Oh bitch, my skin.
8981 2018-04-23 02:24:49 Soy de la época en que hacíamos mierda el DNI verde con la chapita del bolsillo de atrás del Motor Oil.
8982 2018-04-23 02:24:42 12. To treat after hair coloring - Soak a soft cotton towel with olive oil and wipe the spotted skin, it may take some time but the color will come off.
13. To prevent hair loss - Mix 2 eggs with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Smear on the scalp and hair and let it sit for 40 minute
8983 2018-04-23 02:24:31 Went to ikea and bought a dresser, got a car wash and got an oil change today. 

Psych, just woke up from a nap. Gonna wait on the couch for Westworld.
8984 2018-04-23 02:24:28 Go scratch your balls Jones

Just dont open th baby oil.
8985 2018-04-23 02:24:12 This good mood is sponsored by peppermint oil 
8986 2018-04-23 02:24:06 Lotto, strike oil, zoe, something idc at this point SOMETHING just need to fall thru lol
8987 2018-04-23 02:24:00 So by your logic, increasing oil flow to BC would LOWER BC gas prices? Funny, it’s dropped $100/barrel on the world market, and BC still has the highest gas prices in Canada.
8988 2018-04-23 02:23:54 Oh I so love the phrase an oil check.....  I am so using this thankls #bcedchat
8989 2018-04-23 02:23:50 10. To treat dandruff - Massage olive oil onto your scalp and leave overnight. Wash your hair in the morning with a regular shampoo. Try this treatment for a week.
11. To treat dry hair with split ends - Take warm olive oil and smear on the scalp. let it sit for 45 minutes.
8990 2018-04-23 02:23:45 Switch to Shea Moisture. Eye reccomend the Jamacian Black Castor Oil line shampoo and it’s cheap and alittle goes a long way. Any of their deep conditioners work too. Alot of their deep conditioner products have protein in it too
8991 2018-04-23 02:23:20 That's the right attitude, just a bit intimidated by the brand name. I could probably change the oil on a Ferrari, but I wouldn't want to attempt to strip down and rebuild the motor.
8992 2018-04-23 02:23:19 the coconut oil one is p good cause its like a make up remover but also moisturizer :O

8996 2018-04-23 02:22:41 6. Olive oil can serve as a substitute for shaving cream.

8998 2018-04-23 02:22:38 Despite the brussel haters, I love them. Lots of recipes call for bacon - but I don’t eat it, so I throw in some smoked salt, which also enhances the flavor. You can take the outer leaves, toss with a little oil and salt. Bake at 400 F for 5-7min - brussel chips.
8999 2018-04-23 02:22:37 The mirror, now the oil?? We gonna need the full story
9000 2018-04-23 02:22:34 Ah I see one trigger. Anyways, is that oil reflecting or a fancy bluing?
9001 2018-04-23 02:22:26 CBD oil, a gift card for apps like a sleep app or breathing app...
9002 2018-04-23 02:22:10 Our fresh black COC oil works wonders
9003 2018-04-23 02:22:05 can we stop putting 18 tablespoons of oil in every Indian dish thank you
9004 2018-04-23 02:22:03 It was skincare/make up related actually! So the friend replaced all her cotton rounds and make up removers with a micro-fibre cloth and water! (sometimes coconut oil for the waterproof stuff), another made like some facial scrub cause micro-beads were the big  at the time
9005 2018-04-23 02:21:55 A process that involved a 1/3 cup of oil, a bunch of potato skins and kosher salt. Definitely some sticking/scorching. Is there a way to essentially strip it like with cast iron and start from scratch? Or might this be a lost cause?
9006 2018-04-23 02:21:52 A3 I like that by sharing reflections, it helps show that learning isn’t “done” just because a report came out - that was just an “oil check” on our personalized learning journey - and topics may be revisited....will be, not may... #bcedchat
9007 2018-04-23 02:21:49 For the whole 1 hr we were in target I spent abt 95% of that time deciding between buying either conditioner, a hair mask, or argan oil, just teo of those things... Or all of them and THEN coming to thr conclusion that maybe I should just hack off all my hair
9008 2018-04-23 02:21:48 Castor oil spilled all over my carpet
9009 2018-04-23 02:21:45 @Oriel_Morrison Oil inflation is a big worry right now.
9010 2018-04-23 02:21:39 It happens!
9011 2018-04-23 02:21:27 They might just be changing the oil on their couch. You never know.
9012 2018-04-23 02:21:23 My Lyft driver asked me if I knew about black seed oil. I said only from the @blackthought Freestyle on Hot97. He thought that was funny. I asked if he’d heard the Black Thought Freestyle. He said no. I thought that was crazy. #hiphop
9013 2018-04-23 02:21:19 l clean the pores and keep the moisture of your skin. Wash with hot water and soap.
4. To alleviate ear pain - Pour one drop of warm olive oil in your ear.
5. To reduce stomach ulcers and pain - Mix 1 tablespoon of olive oil with 3/4 of a cup of citrus juice or vinegar and drink.
9014 2018-04-23 02:20:58 M7 M12 and airport - the oil addiction triangle!
9015 2018-04-23 02:20:56 Not if a pipeline is laid...that is the cheapest form of transportation for oil and gas.
9016 2018-04-23 02:20:24 Broccoli is easy to eat when it's cooked right and with just a little spray of sesame oil and salt and pepper.

I like chicken but I have to get it to brown slightly and using either tiny amount of honey or sesame oil helps the bland flavour
9017 2018-04-23 02:19:59 @Whatsthefusspod mix peroxide with cooking oil, otherwise it'll dry your cumhole out and make that infection worse
9018 2018-04-23 02:19:50 I’m a cry baby and I just want aloe Vera or coconut oil rubbed on my sunburn 
9019 2018-04-23 02:19:31 Two things would immediately improve the show:

2) Instead of the narrator saying, "Ancient Astronaut Theorists suggest...", he says, "Bigotry of Lowered Expectations suggests..."
9020 2018-04-23 02:19:10 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
9021 2018-04-23 02:18:43 (I wanted to do oral research on the period just before oil in the Arabian gulf, but much of that story is in the heads of now-old, illeterate Bedu reputed to have near-photographic recall for the sort of questions I had. And no one is asking the questions. And they'll die.
9022 2018-04-23 02:18:24 i use rosehip oil and shea butter idk

9028 2018-04-23 02:17:48 You know you’re way too into essential oils when you break your bottle of peppermint oil and cry

9033 2018-04-23 02:17:07 Try Lucas Oil TV app. They broadcasted the race live today. Great coverage...
9034 2018-04-23 02:17:00 I’ve used coconut in the past but my friend keeps telling me to try almond oil, she swears by it!
9035 2018-04-23 02:16:17 My oil change appt is tomorrow at 7:15 am. 7:15 IN THE MORNING. What was I thinking? I’m already dreading work more than a usual Monday.
9036 2018-04-23 02:16:09 Thanks to fracking we are destroying the environment by contaminating the ground and surface water, methane emissions, air pollution, migration of gases and chemicals. Not to mention it cause earthquakes due to the high pressure used to extract oil and gas from rock.
9037 2018-04-23 02:15:55 i guess they do produce the most oil :P
9038 2018-04-23 02:15:49 they’re my favorite vegetable!! chop those lil stumps off, toss in olive oil, oven at 450 for 25-30 min then SALT and BAM also good with balsamic
9039 2018-04-23 02:15:47 Falsities of belief come from not having the union of faith and charity in heart, like the virgins that had a lamp but no oil and couldn't enter the wedding (heaven). Lack of union the cause of all falsities in doctrine; union of external & internal in soul determines salvation.

9043 2018-04-23 02:15:19  iono even remember. I remember looking for you to show you I wore what you picked out. But then the edible and oil caught up with me.
9044 2018-04-23 02:15:16 I put coconut oil on my sunburn and now I smell like my favorite cookie and it makes me hungry. I don’t need anymore sugar, this concerns me.
9045 2018-04-23 02:15:15 I disagree with the author. There have been no incidents with tankers carrying KM oil because there is close to zero risk and a 30% increase in traffic is an increase in risk of .3 X 0 = 0.  No one should pretend opponents have a valid point.

    Oil at a tipping point; remains the main worry.
    Legal issues restrict UID, but subsidy savings continue to rise.
9053 2018-04-23 02:14:01 Sir we should have bought crude oil in bulk when it was below $50 /barrel . Now again same crisis of fiscal deficit and price rise all across ..

9064 2018-04-23 02:12:44 El precio del OIL cerro semana positiva
El ult mes ajusto + 5%
Aumenta el conflicto en Siria, problemas en Libia, OPEP en menor producción, alimentan el alza.
Con motivos, el precio podría seguir en aumento.
Hay negocios dentro del sector.

9066 2018-04-23 02:12:31 There are tricks with "just chicken".
If you're not an obsessed lean freak, you can allow yourself a little spray of sesame oil and a tiny grind of salt and pepper, or even a teaspoon of honey. Sesame oil works the same on broccoli.

9084 2018-04-23 02:09:59 Indeed - and hard to argue with the conclusions. Being able to ship goods 360 degrees helped ATL and DFW with manuf/distribution & oil catapulted HOU. Any surprise that Cuban refugees in MIA out-hustled NO's carnival elite for Latin banking & trade?
9085 2018-04-23 02:09:56 Oil is still in the $60 bbl range, and a mild increase over to summer to the $70 range will have little effect.

It is unlikely that oil will rise above $85 bbl as more drilling, and thus more supply will occur as prices rise.

Once summer ends, price will likely fall as usual.

9089 2018-04-23 02:09:34 I put coconut oil everywhere
9090 2018-04-23 02:09:10 And not build pipelines that bring dirty tar sand oil to BCs Coast.
9091 2018-04-23 02:08:53 yes oil makes the titties pop it's a necessity

9093 2018-04-23 02:08:20 Your energies should focus on the beyond massive floating continent of plastic waste out there in the Pacific Ocean. Ask the oil companies, foreign/domestic, to donate money or labor/equipment or both to clean it up. Remember the add advocating clean up your mess, do it

9096 2018-04-23 02:08:01 i wonder if earth day is just some sort of conspiracy to guilt general civilians into feeling bad that the earth is dying when really the earth is dying bc of big corporations who don't recycle and big oil

9100 2018-04-23 02:07:10 Yes there can be changes. I don’t think shutting Alberta down and shipping foreign oil in is acceptable. I think it’s getting better and less of a footprint in tar sands but I hate to see a tanker ruture with cargo of oil
9101 2018-04-23 02:07:08 I mixed these in with some vitamin e oil for my scalp today...
9102 2018-04-23 02:06:54 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
9103 2018-04-23 02:06:40 Time to walk away from oil for good. Screw them, getting rich off of us is over with. Either corn or electric cars. Time to become a cleaner people. If we want the arabs to be richer, send them our billionaires. America can become great without oil. We have some sense.

9113 2018-04-23 02:05:02 Today in 2010, 4.9 million barrels of #oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico during the Deepwater Horizon explosion, which killed 11 workers.

9118 2018-04-23 02:04:02 Factually speaking you’ve missed on most of the facts, you lack any understanding of the environmental impact of oilsands extraction, the understanding of who is financing the effort to stop the pipelines, or oil marketing. You are full of yourself and speak in rumour.
9119 2018-04-23 02:03:57 We needed a gradual rise in oil prices because if consumers get shell shocked at the pump it’s going to drastically slow the economy since the consumers are used to low prices

9163 2018-04-23 01:57:13 Been meaning to switch from coconut to olive oil but olive oil is so expensive  
9164 2018-04-23 01:57:10 BC is concerned about risks assoc. with a 700% increase in tanker traffic on our coast. Noise pollution is wreaking havoc on struggling #SRKW. An oil spill will devastate our economy & permanently damage our coast. Point is: use existing line while transitioning to clean energy.
9165 2018-04-23 01:57:06 I also want to share some words of wisdom. 1) Don't EVER cook in a crop top 2) Don't EVER throw a burger patty on a pan with hot oil in a crop top 3) Don't cook

9167 2018-04-23 01:56:49 This is probably a response to the forced immigration of Muslims to France after the 1973 oil embargo deal the E.U. was forced to agree to.

9171 2018-04-23 01:56:25 Really? Ask North Carolinians about the coal ash in their rivers (all over the state), thanks to Duke Energy. Ask the residents of Flint, MI if they drink from their water supply, or Marshall Co, SD, where the very oil pipeline they valiantly protested leaked.
9172 2018-04-23 01:56:14 I wish I had the patience to wash this hair and curl it. Because I fucked around and got oil in it.
9173 2018-04-23 01:56:12 Sadly, Line 5 will not be shut down tomorrow. Not unless it breaks and leaks. The greed and deception that has allowed it to run these 65 years will sadly continue. The state has established its priority here. The needs of an oil company have superseded the needs of the people.
9174 2018-04-23 01:56:08 Just reading some oilpatch news. Almost every country in the world is drilling lots of wells, building new rigs, etc. Not in Canada of course, We have anti oil government and it sucks. Million jobs, billions of dollars gone elsewhere. Thanks Trudeau and Notley #cdnpoli

9182 2018-04-23 01:55:09 massachusetts even imported gas from russia. HAD TO bcs they ran out.

FIRST I HEAR DIMS HAVE PAKISTANIS INSIDE OUR GOVT COMPUTERS AND NOW WE SEE THEY GET MONEY FROM RUSSIA TO PREVENT AMERICA FROM PRODUCING ENERGY. they get mad at our oil co's but they do business with russia.

BF: “Absolutely”

Me: “Would you put lotion on my anime tiddies?”

BF: “You have to out oil on anime titties, that’s how they stay so shiny. But yes, of course.”

Me: “Wow, you’re so right. Thank you.”

9189 2018-04-23 01:54:13 Wash and deep condition it first. Use a good amount of conditioner. Let it sit for an hour. Rinse. Then use the argan oil from Hask which Clicks sells. Then leave it to dry

9192 2018-04-23 01:53:44 FOR the uniformed and easily misled they are called REITs.  Not "shell corporations." 
Many might own them in 401k and not know.
9193 2018-04-23 01:53:18 Fuck Oil City. Fuck the people around here who don’t know how to fucking drive. Fuck McDonalds for giving me fucking cold fries. Just fuck it all.
9194 2018-04-23 01:53:06 Donning my forecasting turban, I predict oil prices will peak just after the ARAMCO IPO.  Then all the new shareholders will have to figure out how to keep prices up.....
9195 2018-04-23 01:52:36 You lost the factual argument.  Cheap insults don’t change the facts, Alberta oil is coming by train or by pipeline thru BC. BC needs to focus on protecting its watershed and shorelines.  Treat your sewage & your stormwater drainage(towns of less than 5,000 treat theirs in AB)
9196 2018-04-23 01:52:24 Depends on what product. Tofu typically utilizes white/yellow hilum beans. Breeding programs tend to direct white/yellow hilum beans to non-GMO markets, so quite possible. Brown/black hilum are usually crush/oil end uses.

9215 2018-04-23 01:50:04 It seems to me Norway gets most of its oil from the North Sea which it can then sell world wide.  Alberta just can’t seem to get it’s oil to Canada’s Coasts.  Big difference!

9305 2018-04-23 01:37:10 Oil prices are high because it is a non-renewable resource which is dwindling. We need to move to alternative and clean energy sources. How about you work on that instead of catering to the oil barons.

9325 2018-04-23 01:34:38 .@PepsiCo thanks for the Earth Day post, but to really live up to your message you must cut ties now with ALL companies clearing rainforest for palm oil!
9326 2018-04-23 01:34:29 "Where does Oil come from? Decomposing sludge from our organs that turn black."
9327 2018-04-23 01:34:29 There is a huge difference between fresh olives and a bottle of olive oil. First, the price. Second, the process. In order to extract the best in you, God has to put you under stressful and difficult processes to become the purest of the oil that you could ever be. 
9328 2018-04-23 01:34:24 Naalala ko tuloy mga lectures sa akin ni hubby about exploration ng oil/gas,may visuals pa sya,kunyare interesado ako pero diko tlga intindi,kasi hello,ng ask ako e medj out of context,nainis at di ko daw intindi trabaho nya!ngwalk out ako,nagluto,kain nmn sya,tapos usapan!

9330 2018-04-23 01:34:20 Realizing that the sounds at the beginning of 'Wonder 2' by My Bloody Valentine, which I had long thought resembled an aircraft gaining elevation, in fact sound more like sizzling oil as it cooks meat
9331 2018-04-23 01:34:12 My dad, who hasn't smoked weed in 45 years is about to get medical mj for his sciatica. 
I asked him: "What's the first record you're going to listen to when you get that hash oil?"
Him, without hesitation: "Moody Blues. Days of future passed."
9332 2018-04-23 01:34:03 That darkness was always inside her, she just fought it off when she ran to the oil rig. She ran from the conclave to try and change her story but that dark struggle of her wanting to kill was always there.

9339 2018-04-23 01:32:10 Jimbo nothing you have written indicates to me you have a clue about the supply/demand of oil and natural gas, oil marketing, pipeline efficiencies or safety, or where you are even buying oil from. Respectfully your opinion is meaningless to convo

9343 2018-04-23 01:31:47 So let me get this straight.. Democrats take foreign money to shut down our oil and gas exploration and production, only to turn arround and work to exploit those same fossil fuels in other countries?
9344 2018-04-23 01:31:43 I need some tips lol. Been using my Haitian castor oil finely got some cheek hairs 
9345 2018-04-23 01:31:36 all of them are great for detoxing which is great because lots of fat is there just because of excess toxins so once they go away the fat goes away. you can just take 3 caps of oregano oil with cilantro a day along with spraying magnesium on your body 3x a day
9346 2018-04-23 01:31:14 I would just like to thank the sweet almond oil & shea butter goddesses for blessing my skin like this

9348 2018-04-23 01:30:57 I'm all for banning plastic straws. But we need to stop pretending the problem is shit like straws & shopping bags and not  that our country is controlled by big business and big oil, the EPA is undoing every regulation it can, and Nestle is privatizing the world's water supply.
9349 2018-04-23 01:30:46 quero voltar a escrever oil on canvas e lover of the light, mas também quero começar uma fic nova (e no meio de tudo isso tbm quero me bater por não focar numa coisa de cada vez)

9353 2018-04-23 01:30:31 That's because Canada doesn't buy oil. Oil companies are private and choose who and where the oil comes from to fill their refineries. If you have an issue, maybe direct your outrage at Irving oil who fills their refineries with cheap US oil from fracking. They killed energy east
9354 2018-04-23 01:30:14 Oh, I'm hoping it was oil and not water tuned to walker goo

9358 2018-04-23 01:29:39 are you thinking unfiltered virgin olive oil here or??
9359 2018-04-23 01:29:38 Okay this scene truly was the best! Oil covered walkers truly saved me #FearTheWalkindDead

9367 2018-04-23 01:28:18 Again, not going to happen the East this season and there is little difference between the 5 to 8 seeds.

9378 2018-04-23 01:26:54 When u r representing people at any level & doing interviews publicly for national TV you should put yourself together good at all times by grooming /combing your hair with little hair oil - but that look is NOT Afro/centric and it’s just not appealing nor attractive - I’m sorry
9379 2018-04-23 01:26:53 Ordered the wrong oil cooler lines from Summit Racing, welp... #SundayFail at least i got my old ones off...
9380 2018-04-23 01:26:50 Hmmm...that OIL seems rather valuable to be spilling it all out like that. The Tankers have stopped running from the Persian Gulf #ftwd

9403 2018-04-23 01:23:36 but isn’t it supposed to be the morning oil ? 
9404 2018-04-23 01:23:29 AN for Sub -8, Wiggins for the rest. Save oil lines. I'm never looking for weight that is worth giving up AN fittings on oil lines.

9406 2018-04-23 01:23:05 Along time ago, while waiting for the brownies to finish baking. Someones girl friend got the idea in her head that the seeds would pop like pop corn...so, seeds were dumped into a pan with about 1/2" of hot oil. Well, what a mess. funny watching someone try to mop the ceiling.
9407 2018-04-23 01:23:01 people like “everything adds up!!!!!” like ok im sorry i showered for 30 min but i didnt shower once this week and companies are dumping oil in the ocean so ok
9408 2018-04-23 01:23:00 There is also large opposition to #KinderMorgan in Vancouver and especially on the coast. A spill involving bitumen oil would be a repeat of Exxon Valdez. #ProtectTheInlet #StopKM #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli

9416 2018-04-23 01:22:01 in honor of today i want to remind everyone that the fashion industry and its effects on the environment are second only to the oil industry. big “fast fashion” companies sell styles according to trends which quickly become popular and then die out.

9418 2018-04-23 01:21:59 I bet they will think twice before they pass by the cooking oil with sticky fingers again
9419 2018-04-23 01:21:57 All I wanted to do was lounge around all day. Instead I got my oil changed dropped off the laundry and apparently got new tires  and ran around all fricken day. I was so excited to have weekends off, now all I do is errands 
9420 2018-04-23 01:21:56 Love it but the point is to destroy anything and everything that might benefit the earth.  TraitorTrump and his cronies want to pump every last drop of oil and frack every last whiff of natural gas they can.

9422 2018-04-23 01:21:32 Gambling is poison to an economy dependent on agriculture and small businesses. We don't have oil where you get paid alot for doing nothing

9467 2018-04-23 01:12:47 Well that is concerning. Make sure it's being cooked in an oil without strong flavor. And def oil, not lard or even butter I'd say. Trout is best when you taste the trout and very secondarily, the seasoning that compliments it.
9468 2018-04-23 01:12:26 agree with us or go to the gulag. This is their creed.
9469 2018-04-23 01:12:25 I need good weather so I can lather my stretch marks in coconut oil 
9470 2018-04-23 01:12:23 Vancouver can build a dock and oil storage tanks for jet fuel from Asia. (China). Source for the oil is likely the Mid-East (Iran or Iraq)
9471 2018-04-23 01:12:15 The world can only afford to burn 20% of the known fossil fuel reserves if we are to avoid catastrophic climate change, so every drop of oil we leave in the ground helps. Finding and extracting more is economically and morally nuts.

9479 2018-04-23 01:11:08 Happy Earth Day everyone! Here's your reminder that while individual change is a good way to help the environment, a lot of the issue comes from big corporations and things like big oil! So be aware that our capitalist society's a big factor in climate change!
9480 2018-04-23 01:10:54 Sweetie..did you? I read them all. They are about the fall-out from the Venezuela economy crash and corrupt use of the oil funds. Do wish it to be true. There is no link between the two corruptions

9505 2018-04-23 01:07:11 Afterwards I’ll use the Africa’s best protein treatment again and infuse my hair with the Jamaican black castor oil and that can’t spray
9506 2018-04-23 01:07:08 Baby oil smells so good 
9507 2018-04-23 01:07:07 What did I do for Earth Day? Worked on my gas guzzling V-8 pickup. Work included running at idle speed for 1 and 1/2 hour to boil the water out of the oil. And I ran the a/c in my V-8 Explorer the entire way home from Bemidji (50 miles). Take that, tree huggers!
9508 2018-04-23 01:06:32 President Obama's air regulations under the Clean Air Act on oil/gas industry sources, & EPA enforcement actions against oil/gas industry under CWA & SDWA prove that Fox's Gasland claims about CAA/CWA/SDWA oil/gas "exemptions" were false and fabricated.
9509 2018-04-23 01:06:22 im DYING to get my greasy grubby hands on some oil. or ill end up sculpting with dried acrylic

9511 2018-04-23 01:05:50 No patchouli oil?
9512 2018-04-23 01:05:41 it really was good, tho my potato containment structure wasn't as nice as Chef John's. Unlike my regular beef stew made w a dark roux, no need to brown the flour/oil mixture. Hardest part was cutting up the roast which you have to do in any event.
9513 2018-04-23 01:05:31 pulling out all the stops for my allergies. ibuprofen, claritin, flonase, and now i’m diffusing peppermint and lavender essential oil...so hopefully i can breathe and taste things tomorrow
9514 2018-04-23 01:05:30 I have before, it didn't really help my other plants & they were full together on the window sill. I'm gonna try growing it again but I think the oil gonna help a lot. Neem did back when I had some. (kind of miraculously so, when my pumpkin got fungus on the leaves)
9515 2018-04-23 01:05:05 The last poll I saw said it was 50/50. That isn't the sweeping majority that you and the rest of the #KinderMorgan shills are claiming.

9521 2018-04-23 01:04:28 #essential #oil is beneficial to the skin especially in the winter time when you skin is dry. You only need a few drops as a little goes a long way. Gives you a natural glow.
9522 2018-04-23 01:04:26 Trump is a snake oil salesman. He is anything but honest.
9523 2018-04-23 01:04:20 But yuh oil pump out. Well done
9524 2018-04-23 01:04:07 Grapes must be crushed to make wine! Diamonds form under pressure! Olives are pressed to release oil! Seeds grow in darkness! Moral of the story, when you feel crushed, under pressure, or in darkness, you’re in a powerful place of transformation/transmutation!

9540 2018-04-23 01:01:51 Tar is a product of oil btw not the other way around.
9541 2018-04-23 01:01:41 I like it baked or grilled. I guess it's just not for everyone. I love trout's really rich flavor so I stick to cooking it simple. Not like cod with a lot of batter or whatever. All trout needs is oil in the pan and some lemon pepper honestly.

9552 2018-04-23 01:00:20 I was under the impression it's ok to influence politicians with money. The oil and gas industry has been doing it for decades. The lawsuits are for damages from the "externalities" you laid on us. Polluted water, air, damage from spills, pipelines, blowouts,    
9553 2018-04-23 01:00:18 LOL. I know! I hand-made yum-cha for a friend's birthday party. Took me hours. Then stood at the stove steaming or deep-frying multiple courses for three hours. I actually collapsed at the stove and was lucky not to pull hot oil onto me. "Never again" is right!

9555 2018-04-23 00:59:59 No one wants a medal. The oil BC is depending on to fuel its petroleum dependent lifestyle comes from oil and natural gas in Alberta. The oil & gas industry is paying for green intiatives & technology to make BC move away from its raw sewage dumping & forest mismanagement.

9604 2018-04-23 00:52:35 It's ok. I really liked it at first, but it doesn't always agree with my stomach. 

We also got a free sample of the deep fried waffles with "secret sauce" and powdered sugar. The sauce was maple syrup and no powdered sugar. More like an oil logged hard eggo waffle.

9611 2018-04-23 00:51:07 This has been a mess in Dallas where there are more bikes than any other city. It's a good idea but part of the thing is that budget items get treated as such.

9618 2018-04-23 00:50:06 Apologies. Just very tired of all those that think the West coast is this perfect pristine place when it isn't. I lived there. The rainbow slicked oil from cruise ships, sunken vessels, and overboard fuel barrels is a real problem and has been for decades.
9619 2018-04-23 00:49:53 I made this one. Coconut oil, evoo, Himalayan sea salt
9620 2018-04-23 00:49:49 Now all i do is coconut oil and this natural soap i got from this local “organic” place lol. And only wash my face when i have time lol I’ll have to try the black soap thank you

9629 2018-04-23 00:48:55 Keep telling yourself the same delusional propaganda. But we the people are standing up to big oil while people like you have sided with dirty oil money. #BTW, you haven't won, and threats by Alberta proves you are insecure bullies. #StopKM #ProtectTheInlet #AlbertaWhine
9630 2018-04-23 00:48:48 What kind of oil pipe line is that?
9631 2018-04-23 00:48:43 Agreed. Real mayonnaise is not made with soy oil. Soybean oil is a product of farm bill subsidies, and is neither healthy nor tasty. It is associated with many food allergies, and linked to phytoestrogen issues. Using Cage Free eggs is essentially green-washing the product.
9632 2018-04-23 00:48:42 I just put beard oil on for the first time and let me tell you my complexion is absolutely GLOWING. In the past 10 minutes I've already mastered 5rd dimensional astrophysics, solved the Israel-Palestine crisis, and found the g-spot.

9637 2018-04-23 00:47:06 Oh, I'm sure "some" oil will still be used then, just not enough to fill a pipeline. And it certainly won't be Canadian oil. The most expensive/polluting sources will be dropped first.

9745 2018-04-23 00:32:15 Not gonna start today, but I’m confused by the trend that says blacks will be ok if they just abandon democrats. Btw, I don’t care about party affiliation. There is never one reason for a problem, and anyone who says they are “woke” while everyone’s sleeping is selling snake oil.
9746 2018-04-23 00:32:13 @texasdemocrats @BetoORourke Clean air in Texas? Nah! In addition to that money, Corncob & Rafael also wrote a little exception into the tax bill that helps them profit on their oil & gas investments.
9747 2018-04-23 00:32:05 It’s a serious problem for you and your music if you think trump, his demeanor, his history, is honest in any way. He’s a con man, a snake oil salesmen, how can someone that creates music, an artist, not see that?
9748 2018-04-23 00:32:00 Exactly... why the hell would Russia want TRUMP? Hes pro oil and gas drilling. We’re taking big chunks out of Russia’s economy by doing more drilling and fracking here.

9860 2018-04-23 00:15:28 Trevor, oil spills in oceans are far more expensive than on land. A 7x increase in tanker traffic including Super tankers a spill could cost up to $40 BILLION as per Government estimates, unlike the $15M spill on land you can't easily clean 100ft below sea level if bitumen sinks

9883 2018-04-23 00:13:01 Venezuela's crisis is partially a result of overspending in the hopes that global oil prices would keep going up. when the price of oil crashed, VZ went down harder than it would have had it saved up a rainy day fund earlier. ofc hindsight is 20/20.

9890 2018-04-23 00:11:45 He should abandon the planet. Doesn’t Titan or Triton or one of those moons have oil like substances on it?
9891 2018-04-23 00:11:36 @oil_markets Thanks for the RT!
9892 2018-04-23 00:11:27 Thank you! I don't particularly use oil so that's fine. Gluten is tough and so is coffee but I've cut back half. ^-^ It's a work in progress.
9893 2018-04-23 00:11:20 Maybe it will be. It's not right now. Solar photovoltaic is the most promising, but guess what, per unit of energy it's not currently cheaper than oil or nat gas.
9894 2018-04-23 00:11:14 @OIL_MEN Bonjour, est-il possible de vous poser quelques questions sur Saudi Aramco dans le cadre d'un papier sur le sujet ? Merci d'avance. Bien cordialement, LMA

Sounds like you believe in conspiracy theories by those competing against BIG OIL BIG COAL et al! Of course, these global corporates need all the help they can get from tweeters like you!
9898 2018-04-23 00:10:30 Alberta and Saskatchewan....oil, gas, great hunting,fishing, agriculture and tech, nice diversified economy.....be a protectorate of USA like Puerto Rico ..they would love our contribution to American economy..and B.C.could freeze to death in the dark,,eating berries

9903 2018-04-23 00:10:01 I’m getting my car detailed this week & getting an oil change. I cannot wait
9904 2018-04-23 00:09:57 Here on Earth Day 2018 USA is once again seen globally as hypocrital with the US Environmental Protection Agency headed by Scott Pruitt-Zinke  opening US Monuments to mining/oil/ignoring Native Amer sacred areas-in 2018 elections US can reclaim its soul/honor-VOTE!
9905 2018-04-23 00:09:56 I heard more shit about what happen outside the oil spill then inside 
9906 2018-04-23 00:09:54 But they shot the price up claiming due to Parkland & Cherry Point being down. Now with Parkland back up the price should start falling instead of going to 157.9 This is where the consumer has no trust with the oil companies. I'm not blaming u Dan.
9907 2018-04-23 00:09:37 Nigeria’s former Presidents have awarded oil blocks to their lovers, tailors, heartless oligarchs, cohorts, frontmen/women etc. aggregating over $1 Trillion usd. 
Shameless leaders.

9911 2018-04-23 00:09:19 Ok. Buying that Pistachio ice cream aroma therapy oil was a bad idea. 
I'm now obsessing to buy pistachio ice cream but I'm lactose intolerant...
9912 2018-04-23 00:09:04 That's what KM is all about Suze. To allow for a way for AB to get oil to the world market at the market rate bringing an estimated 15 Billion to Coffers here.
9913 2018-04-23 00:09:04 Changed the oil in my bike. That bitch riding so smooth.
9914 2018-04-23 00:08:44 Today I took a bunch of old jugs that are filled w/ oil from changing oil in my vehicles for years away from the side of my house where it looked bad & poured them into the stream behind the house. I also got rid of some old tires by burning them. Taking care of our mama  
9915 2018-04-23 00:08:36 Yup. Somewhere buried deep in my feed is a video of him and his views on oil. I'll see if I can find it for you.

#westcoast will never recover from an oil spill

9919 2018-04-23 00:08:07 Infinite growth is possible only through environmental sustainability. Problem is not in growth, but current economic model. Only now humanity is upgrading assets from stones and oil to information, which will be keyfactor in solving threats like influence on climate.

9928 2018-04-23 00:05:53 I used an oil diffuser with essential oil blend called repair-guard. Worked great to clear my cough/congestion
9929 2018-04-23 00:05:48 So now this pipeline gets grouped in with offshore drilling.   Because???    Didn't realize kindermorgan was drilling an oil well in the inlet.   An uncontrolled blow out is different that a pipeline leak... you do know that right??
9930 2018-04-23 00:05:28 Of course, it makes sense. Horizontal drilling and fracking have allowed the US to not only become energy self sufficient but also to export.
However, this US production also brings down the price of oil hurting producing countries like Russia.

9932 2018-04-23 00:04:47 I wonder if the @acccgovau can explain why it is letting fuel prices remain so high on the back of this "Syrian Fuel Crisis" scaremongering, despite the fact Australia imports ZERO crude oil or oil products sourced from Syria.
9933 2018-04-23 00:04:43 he's doing this so his oligarch buddies in oil and coal and petrochemical can scrape the planet harder for more cash.
9934 2018-04-23 00:04:39 i got the bloodrot, someone gimmie a jigger of hamlin's wizard oil!
9935 2018-04-23 00:04:36 anyone ever read RT? any real propaganda I have seen has been aimed at our oil industry.
9936 2018-04-23 00:04:17 Yummmmmmm .... warm oil. Seriously. Nom nom nom.
9937 2018-04-23 00:03:50 My big marine oil spill break came when the Canadian Arctic Resources Committee (CARC) hired me to write their submission to the Brander-Smith Tanker Safety Panel. That led to the latter hiring me as a full-time, in-house Consultant for nine months. The rest is history.

9941 2018-04-23 00:03:06 North Sea oil is #FalseFlag & #contrails. All that offshore traffic is to hide the UK’s Stargate programme. That’s why ABZ is full of badly disguised aliens. Duh!
9942 2018-04-23 00:03:00 someone disseminate this message immediately:

you can be interesting without mentioning CBD oil!
9943 2018-04-23 00:02:54 Americans want to be Free and treasure the Value of Freedom to choose what they want. We are offended when Oil and Gas industry can manipulate the price at Gas pump. Last week in Rochester NY price went up from $2.56/ gallon to $2.79/gallon in 3 days? Say Goodbye to Gas Stations!
9944 2018-04-23 00:02:52 The US is bathing in oil, we don't need to destroy more habitat to get it.
9945 2018-04-23 00:02:46 sweety u got feets oil?
9946 2018-04-23 00:02:31 And where people get between #YEG and #YYC by different (less safe, slower, less economical) ways today, oil also gets from A to B, as needed, in less economical, less safe ways until #KinderMorgan gets built.

9958 2018-04-23 00:01:29 What if they made extra slutty olive oil
9959 2018-04-23 00:01:28 Kinder Morgan will get government help only to keep private investment going. Alberta not Ottawa is considering buying it. Ottawa is looking at helping only. Let's not forget that the Oil Sandsalso had big moneies put into by the federal government helping to make it what it is.

9962 2018-04-23 00:01:18 Good question.

I wonder if the opponents of KM can see this as an example of how a pipeline tranports people much quicker and safer from A to B. It's exactly the same for oil, quicker and safer.
9963 2018-04-23 00:01:06 Conservatives (true conservatives) provide the freedom and security for urban America to help itself.

9965 2018-04-23 00:00:43 Too much money invested in Oil and too many greedy Oil Barons won't  let that happen...and eventually they will invest in electric cars and monopolize that market... damn it.. .I'm becoming a cynic.

9970 2018-04-23 00:00:26 I have nothing more to say to you until you can acknowledge other oil revenue provinces and how the economy has effected them. You can tell me Saskatchewan is not a fair comparison and you can try to tell me why but until you stop wasting my time reusing the same talking points
9971 2018-04-23 00:00:23 Didn't mean to seem defensive. Just trying to understand your perspective.

How about other commodities like gold, silver, and oil?
9972 2018-04-23 00:00:16 Please maintain a safe distance from the hot oil spray.
9973 2018-04-23 00:00:07 We still need to create money or we can’t afford solutions to fix certain environmental problems. We have a enormous amount of oil. The entire world uses oil still. We need lots of money. Safest and most efficient way to move oil... is a pipeline. Weird concept I know.
9974 2018-04-23 00:00:07 Olive, jojoba, and sweet almond oils are all wonderful elixirs for hair. If your hair is thick and heavy, coconut oil works wonders.
