0 2018-10-01 23:59:51 Why do Americans need bump stocks? Why do Americans need silencers? Why do Americans need military grade fire arms? What/who is it exactly that you’re defending yourselves from?
1 2018-10-01 23:58:48 CT’s law banning bump stocks started today. I guess states have more promise than Congress.., thank you @MomsDemand 

Trying to end gun violence.
2 2018-10-01 23:57:37 You should also know, as is often the case with government, they try to help and over reach due to their ignorance on the topic. This ban would apply to a lot more than scary bump stocks. It's terrible legislation and a terrible idea.

4 2018-10-01 23:56:49 Some startling stats:  Gun control laws have passed in 26 states in <5 months. Bump stocks banned in 9 states & counting. ~250K voters registered by the gun control lobby. If this trend keeps up, the next knock on the door will be them coming to take all your guns away.

13 2018-10-01 23:51:49 Was seemingly doing fine under Bush until "pop." The economy is actually crap right now. Just that big corporations are using their tax cuts to buy back their own stocks and artificially inflate the prices. It's a great economy if you're a billionaire, if not you're slowly
14 2018-10-01 23:51:32 Yeah Washington, that’s it.  They banned bump stocks.  A device Obama’s Administration approved.
15 2018-10-01 23:51:00 One year after the horrific shooting at Las Vegas, nothing has been passed in Congress to prevent mass shootings. Not banning bump stocks. Not making background checks universal. Not renewing the assault weapons ban. We don’t have to accept mass shootings as the new normal.
16 2018-10-01 23:50:43 I know. Bump stocks are still legal and the mentally ill can still buy military grade weapons.

40 2018-10-01 23:49:13 The US has reached a trade deal with Mexico and Canada,. Stocks were higher, as were the USD and US yields. Gainers on Wall St included @GM and @Ford . However, trade talks between the US and China aren't coming to such conclusions, as they are still ongoing.
41 2018-10-01 23:48:33 They prefer a good economy and peace. Maybe they own stocks and real estate. Maybe they prefer not to be slaves to the plantation.
42 2018-10-01 23:48:14 Karen...why wouldn't you buy a 13 $GE strike on a 6 month or 1 year call as opposed to a 2020 LEAP, if you feel 6 months is adequate time to reevaluate the stocks performance ???
43 2018-10-01 23:48:03 Take profits on a huge win and regroup! It’s about consistency and protecting your capital. Remember that bulls get paid, bears get paid, but pigs get slaughtered. Non of these stocks have any fundimentals. Listen to Tim, you’ll do better I promise. He has seen this 1,000 times.

49 2018-10-01 23:45:19 Uhm, we know it was committed by a crazy dude with a bunch of rifles with bump stocks, and that 1 year later bump stocks are still legal.
50 2018-10-01 23:45:07 Yeah I have a feeling this has to do with the cia and terrorist. But let Schiff lie some more blame bump stocks. I didn’t realize bump stock could shoot on there own.

55 2018-10-01 23:42:54 If #CBD has been able to push related tickers way up,let’s ask ourselves why #H2 hasn’t been able to push related stocks as much? Specially when #H2 has proved it can change the way the world moves!! C’mon Jules!! Let’s make it happen! H2!!

59 2018-10-01 23:41:46 And Adam Schiff you guys have done nothing all you've done is resist while in the meantime the president and his administration have been working on getting rid of the regulations so that bump stocks are illegal
60 2018-10-01 23:41:43 And reporters have to go everywhere in a party of 9, one of them has to be black so you can count them. Maybe the black reporters wanted to report about sports, stocks, fashion but not about politics? Have y ever seen a black reporter in a war zone? Ppl got preferences.
61 2018-10-01 23:40:29 Mass shooters want firepower and we voluntarily provide them with high capacity magazines, and bump stocks.  The NRA and those that contribute to the NRA are their enablers.
62 2018-10-01 23:40:24 Exactly, the beauty of compounding and investing in individual stocks! Way better than indexing imo and more entertaining too. But can take a lot of work!
63 2018-10-01 23:39:52 And the real criminals are beside themselves. Oh my what are they to do now with no more bump stocks? Guess they have to see this Bob's your Uncle guy.
64 2018-10-01 23:38:41 @Vic_Neufeld Do you even realize how bad your shareholders are taking a beaten during your vow of silence? Aphria is the laughing stock of stocks it can’t get out of its own way.
65 2018-10-01 23:38:16 Don’t blame the Democrats for that monumental screw up.  The next mass shooting, hopefully never, if bump stocks are involved, will fall squarely on the shoulders of the NRA and the GOP that support the sale and ownership of said bump stocks.

71 2018-10-01 23:33:40 Indeed, there has to be a loser. But just the fact that MJ will start selling in Canada Oct 17, thought there would be some action to he upside in the MJ world of stocks.
72 2018-10-01 23:32:36 And forgetting or ignoring sensible gun laws. Bump stocks.

82 2018-10-01 23:30:02 Just like a year ago Trump offered a deal you wouldn't take. 
Just like last year we also pointed out bump stocks can be made using a belt.
Just like last year we asked why the gunman targeted conservatives.

96 2018-10-01 23:24:53 My time line is the best...they put me on to 4 stocks today that all made at least 30% growth today alone...this is the tribe I’m trying to build and be a part of (FYI they were: OGEN, to get more IGC, more TLRY, NBEV)...y’all are the best
97 2018-10-01 23:24:41 Hi, @DLoesch. I’ll ask again. Please tell me one good purpose bump stocks serve. Because I can give you hundreds or reasons why they are bad! @NRA @NRATV
98 2018-10-01 23:23:22 Stocks with high average volume and an average price above $10 have no issues...
99 2018-10-01 23:22:17 You, Joseph, obviously don't live in Nevada.  Maybe you could refresh us on the positive use of bump stocks.
100 2018-10-01 23:21:58 I have fifty perfectly fine dollars to furnish to a wise retailer who stocks the game. Just need to know a good date when I can make that transaction a reality.
101 2018-10-01 23:21:40 High volume stocks priced above $10 have no issues.

103 2018-10-01 23:20:32 thats not true at all. bump stocks were banned bc of this.

105 2018-10-01 23:20:18 Rich Cordray rightfully recognized the anniversary of the Las Vegas massacre, and the 58 people who lost their lives one year ago today, and the hundreds who suffered grievous injury. He called for common sense gun reform including background check and banning gun stocks.

116 2018-10-01 23:13:48 Bump-stocks are STILL legal.  

GOP:  "Can't change things like this over night"

Kavanaugh hearing. 

GOP:  "We just HAVE to get this done right NOW!"
117 2018-10-01 23:12:33 And yet bump stocks are still legal
118 2018-10-01 23:12:17 The only reason bump stocks are a thing, is because of the NFA.  Repeal the NFA, and the demand for bump stocks goes back down to zero, which is where it belongs.
119 2018-10-01 23:11:38 Goddamn there’s so much overpriced crap out there in the ASX small cap sector still. Likewise though, there’s some majorly underpriced/undervalued stocks, but these are few and far between. Mostly #gold #tin or #copper stocks though. I sense some major rerates are on the horizon.
120 2018-10-01 23:11:30 I could watch the wolf of Wall Street a million times over and still never end up fully understanding what they actually do with the stocks
121 2018-10-01 23:10:49 Mike DeWine's solutions to gun violence:
Watch social media and put more cops in schools.

Rich Cordray's answer:
Universal, comprehensive background checks. Ban bump stocks. Common sense gun safety measures.

Mike DeWine never once mentioned the word "guns" #OHGovDebate
122 2018-10-01 23:10:43 Bump stocks are a canard. If you find a good price on an RPG down there, DM me. And not just the unit, but the grenades too.
123 2018-10-01 23:08:00 If you have to ask, you don't see what's going on. He's had multiple allegations of sexual assault, he said white nationalists are good people, he never made bump stocks illegal, Puerto Rico still needs help, he believes kim Jong un, shall I continue?
124 2018-10-01 23:07:44 Random thought...... How many of y'all would consider yourselves financially literate in stocks, bonds, treasury bills, etc.) Be honest:
125 2018-10-01 23:07:07 Funny how many “procedures” there are to get rid of bump stocks, yet to start off shore drilling, take part of our National Parks away, importing elephant ivory again, using asbestos in building again, lift ban on pesticides linked to declining bee populations...that’s all done!!
126 2018-10-01 23:06:00 Did they complete the investigation and rule that bump stocks were to blame?
127 2018-10-01 23:05:52 Except SNAP and APRN actually have a business and cash flow and are still getting absolutely shit on day in and day out. TLRY would be reminiscent of the dotcom bubble if the same phenomenon were happening with 1000 different stocks. Otherwise it’s just a DRYS unicorn

130 2018-10-01 23:02:59 We should be doing better financially not living from paycheck to paycheck or surviving off a monthly check. We have lived in poverty for too long. We have lived below our privileges. We got be educated on finances, investment, and stocks. We gotta do better and rise.
131 2018-10-01 23:02:35 larry said pending stocks? lmao
132 2018-10-01 23:02:32 @realDonaldTrump  Why are bump stocks still available to buy on line?
133 2018-10-01 23:02:31 There are 1.5Million other stocks better than GE...sad
134 2018-10-01 23:01:08 Can someone please tell me why the hell bump stocks aren’t banned yet!!! @realDonaldTrump @ScottforFlorida @DLoesch @NRA @NRATV @marcorubio @SenMajLdr @SpeakerRyan

143 2018-10-01 22:58:34 Alternatively......1 year ago a man was able to bring in 24 rifles some with bump stocks into a hotel room and murder 58 people from 450 meters away.... #Gunreformnow

150 2018-10-01 22:54:25 Bump stocks? #LasVegasShooting
151 2018-10-01 22:54:15 I understand the argument: "give 'em bump stocks and they'll leave us alone", but that's not how any of this works.

Giving any ground to gun-grabbers only gives them an ego boost (and seeing how they're mostly celebrities protected by armed guards, that's not in short supply).
152 2018-10-01 22:54:10 Why does the cryptocurrency market cap have more room for exponential growth? 

Because to buy traditional assets (Stocks, Bonds, Real Estate) you need a bank account and a identity. 

Cryptocurrency is for everyone! All you need is some fiat to convert
153 2018-10-01 22:52:43 And did you hear after a long meeting with the NRA Trump has decided to ban bump stocks it only took a year

159 2018-10-01 22:50:28 Will watch it. These stocks are fun to watch !!!
160 2018-10-01 22:49:27 You see...we have this thing called a Constitution. Current admin is nearly ready to finalize ban of bump stocks but I guess you don’t want to talk about that.
161 2018-10-01 22:49:19 & when is Trump banning bump stocks like he said he would... a year ago...?
162 2018-10-01 22:48:55 It's been a year today since the mass shooting in Vegas.  Bump stocks are still available all across the U. S.  Shame on you, Congress.
163 2018-10-01 22:48:14 When your stocks looking right 
164 2018-10-01 22:47:08 Me and my friend are trying to stock up on keycards (where she pickpockets me and stocks the things under the beds) but we can't put the things in the drawer (we both have extra storage pass) did you fully remoev the drawer access?
165 2018-10-01 22:47:08 And so “Don’t Boo”“Hiccup” Heller (R-Adelson) celebrates one year of doing absolutely nothing about assault weapons, bump stocks, background checks for domestic abusers, the mentally ill, even terrorists. America’s most mediocre senator couldn’t even react to a Nevadan tragedy.

another lie from @realDonaldTrump and clowns  #VegasShooting
174 2018-10-01 22:44:58 Chump said it was the worst trade deal in the history of the world and then tweaked it .000% and now sings its praises. Another PR nothing. Campaigning, he said stocks were in bubble. He now says its great. Another PR nothing. You people are clueless.

190 2018-10-01 22:39:30 One year later, bump-stocks are still legal.

Promise Made, Promise Broken @realDonaldTrump.
191 2018-10-01 22:38:56 Fraudulent? Like what recently got you banned for life from trading stocks? How did it feel taking older people's life savings?
192 2018-10-01 22:38:40 All this time and bump stocks are still legal in most states.

206 2018-10-01 22:28:28 It was one of the laughing stocks of the 90s. People just want it for ugly nostalgia. (Though the logo is sorta cool)
207 2018-10-01 22:26:01 It's been a year since deadliest shooting in American history left more than 50 dead & more than 850 wounded. A year later, you can purchase bump stocks online, weapons of war are used in schools & churches, & 2 out of every nine guns are purchased without a background check
208 2018-10-01 22:25:34 We agree! When does that happen? I'd specify that my problem isn't with them it's with all of the workarounds that ppl find, like the bump stocks, which greatly increase the danger of the weapon. The increase speed & large magazine combined with the mods are what make it deadly.
209 2018-10-01 22:24:28 Oh boy we finally see some real performance chasing from “smart allocators”. They r chasing more growth at exactly the wrong time. It never fails to amaze me. 2019 and growth stocks will have a hard time u can bank that and time stamp it folks. Chasers always tell us what to do

212 2018-10-01 22:21:39 You are always in favor of any law that restricts civilian ownership of weapons.  Bump stocks  could be made class 3 devices and that would rectify the 1986 restrictions on full auto guns.  That is the common sense solution
213 2018-10-01 22:20:37 The least we could do would be to ban bump stocks, something @realDonaldTrump said he would do, something he has not done.
214 2018-10-01 22:20:20 Well bump stocks havent existed for the entire history of our country they are a relatively recent development and have been involved in the worst mass shooting in our history. How many people have to die so you can have fun shooting cans?
215 2018-10-01 22:20:13 Can you tell me what the GOP did to prevent multiple weapons from getting into the hands of someone who was that mentally ill?  Did congress make bump stocks illegal after the massacre?

223 2018-10-01 22:16:44 You could have banned bump stocks after the shooting, the NRA even supported it, but then you pulled out your wish list to ban all semi-automatic firearms (about 70% of the guns in the US) Common sense & liberals do not go hand in hand
224 2018-10-01 22:15:44 What free stuff? How has Trump helped the blue collar worker in America? He hasn't. The Republican tax scheme helped the elite class avoid high taxes.

227 2018-10-01 22:14:59 A year ago today we suffered one of the deadliest mass shootings in our history. 58 people killed. 851 injured. In minutes. Yet bump stocks are STILL legal. We cannot rest until we defeat the NRA & finally pass laws to end the epidemic of gun violence in our nation. #VegasStrong
228 2018-10-01 22:14:13 Nothing you said changes a thing I said. BTW I am a gun owner and CWP holder. I am pro 2nd amendment. Bump stocks serve no purpose for civillian use and the military doesn't need them. Ban them.

230 2018-10-01 22:13:13 One year after the tragedy in Las Vegas, Republicans still oppose commonsense gun laws that will help keep us safer. The shooter used legally purchased assault weapons and bump stocks to take 58 lives. Today, someone could still stockpile the same arsenal. We have to stop this.
231 2018-10-01 22:12:54 The greatest investments you can ever make in your life is not in stocks and shares, savings, calling, career/business, properties and so on but rather in your family. Invest in your marriage, children and meaningful relationships and that my friend pays the greatest dividends.
232 2018-10-01 22:12:51 The one thing I struggle with is finding stocks that present opportunities for options trade.  There are so many more stocks than currency pairs that its a bit overwhelming.  My next goal is to build a system for efficiently reviewing stocks #trading #nextsteps
233 2018-10-01 22:12:34 No idiot we don’t want you to take everyone’s guns!  Just want you to ban bump stocks!
234 2018-10-01 22:12:27 We WERE willing to ban bump stocks. But you didn’t want to just ban bump stocks, you also wanted to nationally ban adjustable butt stocks, pistol grips, flash suppressors, vented hand grips... 

... you know the usual we give an inch & you try to go 5 miles.
235 2018-10-01 22:11:47 I can fire a semi auto at almost the same rate as a bump stock allows, and I’ll actually be able to aim. Bump stocks make aiming pretty much impossible.

239 2018-10-01 22:09:39 Yes there is a reason-doesn’t change the Constitution or why the 2A passed.   Bump stocks should be legal just like full autos.  If the gov can issue them to combat troops-or cops-there should be a reasonable path for citizens to own them.
240 2018-10-01 22:09:34 Socks and ‘stocks is my nearly daily wear since starting grad school. I have zero regrets. Let’s start a revolution.

245 2018-10-01 22:07:52 @NRA Please provide info on upcoming legislation on bump stocks.  Will it be possible to keep them for those who already own one?  Will binary triggers remain legal?
246 2018-10-01 22:07:40 If they respected the lives lost, they would have done something, anything. They couldn’t even ban bump stocks!

It’s my town, and on behalf of my neighbors : Fuck You Mike!
247 2018-10-01 22:07:02 Banning bump stocks. Within 11 minutes, 58 people were murdered and 422 people were struck and injured by bullets. Some of those people will be in wheelchairs for the rest of their lives... 480 people were hit with bullets in 11 minutes.

251 2018-10-01 22:04:26 This post is incredibly disingenuous 

Cortez-Masto, Titus, & Rosen have all voted to strengthen gun laws and supported bans on bump stocks while Heller supported reciprocity & legalization of silencers as well as voting to loosen gun laws
252 2018-10-01 22:03:44 @josbor8 that’s a smart play why I always have my “foundation” stocks, but no I don’t disagree with you on that just stay ahead of the curve

258 2018-10-01 22:01:48 Nice work > @karenfinerman ..plausible thinking, as a result of @JeffImmelt's ruinous $GE CEO run there is no "benefit of the doubt" time to give ge CEO's
- agreed w/ T-Slime and @GuyAdami ...shuffle the deck until a winning hand is dealt. #stocks
259 2018-10-01 22:01:34 Woah wait... are your flunky tweeters done with the Kavanugh allegations? Instead of bump stocks, I predict the dems will get “bumped out” of office. You dems are so predictable.
260 2018-10-01 22:01:21 like anglers were an issue to stocks like the small number of commercial shore fishermen traditional fisheries were a problem the smaller the target the easier to shoot large scale uk/eu boats unchecked a joke give back our beachnets or not fit4purpose.

264 2018-10-01 21:58:52 No body is covering this. Looked in yahoo stocks and td Ameritrade and not a peep
265 2018-10-01 21:58:24 No that is not the thing, bump stocks are garbage they have no accuracy.
266 2018-10-01 21:58:20 Cuz we’re all so worried about bump stocks after you’ve gaslit the entire country with your SC shenanigans.
267 2018-10-01 21:56:28 But bump stocks are necessary!!! (says no sane individual)

273 2018-10-01 21:55:17 Still checking out the basic stuff on stockopedia and even stocks like. ZTF rank a lot lower than I’d expected.  It’s a shame so many of my stocks apparently are in distress
274 2018-10-01 21:54:46 POTUS addressed bump stocks this morning. It takes a while to get the process through to ban bump stocks. It should be completed in the next few weeks. Dems are looking for anything now for distraction for the miscalculation of this call for the FBI.

No more FBI connections...
275 2018-10-01 21:53:42 Next 2 on Citrons short list. Traded in and out of $IGC in the $1-$3 range. Way overextended.  $NBEV IMO is pure speculation. Banking on a deal with $KO. When the plumber starts recommending weed stocks, it's time to get out. #cvsi is one of the only legit plays in the 420 space.
276 2018-10-01 21:53:37 Be careful fam. They’re the gateway stocks!
277 2018-10-01 21:53:32 Haven’t traded stocks in over a month.  Trading $ES and loving it.  Specialization in this business is a good thing IMO.
278 2018-10-01 21:53:28 My paycheck is up, stocks are doing great, I no longer have to pay the individual mandate and he's human just like me.
279 2018-10-01 21:52:07 The shift from stocks, bonds, and real estate could be rapid.  If Bitcoin pulls demand from those asset classes, it could lead to massive panic selling.  All three asset classes are way higher than historical averages already, which just provides more fuel for the bear market
280 2018-10-01 21:51:48 Paddock locked outta 2nd room
Paddock on drugs

287 2018-10-01 21:49:26 nice chart!  Debt fell during 40s-80s but nevertheless stocks rallied

289 2018-10-01 21:48:18 From your tweet to Gods ears . Also took a small piece of $BILI which had a nice little bump today.  Tight SL on that one, after your comment earlier today about Chinese stocks....thanks as always Sensei!
290 2018-10-01 21:48:02 God bless you
291 2018-10-01 21:47:39 Bump stocks are irrelevant when it comes to human nature. Shouldn't you be working extra hard now against that human nature that attempts to assassinate the good character of others who are actually DOING stuff to improve all of our lives, instead of just mouthing stuff?
292 2018-10-01 21:47:13 Ok, Dianne, how many mass shootings have occured since last October 1st that were committed using a bump stock?  That's right "0", let's get rid of them just in case.  Bump stocks will go away on their own, they're useless and a waste of expensive ammunition.
293 2018-10-01 21:46:46 lol. Bump stocks.
294 2018-10-01 21:46:13 But either way, Okinawan diets include plenty of animal based stocks, moderate amounts of fish and meat, plenty of veggies, grains... everything in moderation.
295 2018-10-01 21:46:09 We've taken a look for you and can see that on our page it shows that the sale is limited time only and is only available while stocks last. So be sure to grab some amazing offers quick before the items go out of stock.
296 2018-10-01 21:46:06 Do you own $sfix? Liked your commentary on $RH we have the same taste in stocks. In at 36.
297 2018-10-01 21:45:34 Why did I think that Billy and Phyllis had more personal cash, stocks, $omething between the two of them???  
They really need Jack to bail Billy out?

300 2018-10-01 21:44:49 Coasting on Pres Obama's fumes. Putin's puppet is a failure, he's been exposed by 3 investigative reports&his own staff leaks his incompetence like a sieve. He's opposite of King Midas. Stocks have zip to do w/you or him, his tariffs and deficit causing tax cuts for 1%ers do.
301 2018-10-01 21:44:48 Follow his$$ trail. Financial disclosure very interesting. His salary is$200,000 and wife's 60,000. Country club,private schools,no stocks,no additional income. Yet 2.1 million dollar home?
302 2018-10-01 21:44:32 obama approved bump stocks, just sayin.
303 2018-10-01 21:44:31 Wait wait wait...so he is going to ban bump-fire stocks in the next couple weeks, and your response is "But me me me!!! My bill!! Unless you choose me you're not serious!!" Seems logical. 
304 2018-10-01 21:43:49 Support and Resistance Lines really define where people either make money or lose money, they are lines of wins and loses.

306 2018-10-01 21:43:37 They probably aren’t Miami, but they aren’t Detroit, either. That in mind, thanks for those stocks! Felt pretty good about NE after that game.
307 2018-10-01 21:42:50 Monday close: corn +9.5Z, beans +9.75X=same cents increase tells the difference in S:U. Wheat +1.75Z-SRW, meal +4.5Z, hogs +1.825Z, cattle +0.25Z. Crude oil rocketed +2.22X. US$ idx +0.16 to 95.30. Dow stocks +192. The trade liked US/Canada news. But is it really a big deal?

311 2018-10-01 21:41:41 What a disingenuous, base- pandering tweet! Rep. Schiff, u know full well that Bump Stocks are on the verge of being banned. If not for all of the endless govt red tape & legislative rules, they’d be history by now. Somehow I doubt we’ll hear a peep from u on that day!
312 2018-10-01 21:41:38 Are you also going to be banning rubber bands, bike tubes, leather belts?  I don't care if bump stocks are banned but what good is this type of symbolic legislation?

3. $TSLA buy below $300, ride the wave on this one i.e buy low sell high
4. $NVDA good growth stock, will pass $300 in soon
5. $ADBE

It took MA no time at all to ban bump stocks.
320 2018-10-01 21:36:43 Sorry -after rereading my tweet realized I had screwed up -I meant all the knobs trying to play on the short side I am fucking tired of their tweets. Make it sound so fucking easy. Trading small cap stocks on the short side -good fucking luck. Stay cool
321 2018-10-01 21:35:40 Humans are killing too many sharks (millions every year) and in inhumane ways. Many being definned alive for shark fin soup, and thrown back into the ocean to die from suffocation or blood loss.

More #sharks actually means improved fish stocks.  More fish. Better fish.

338 2018-10-01 21:28:52 When there is buying volume at the end of a crazy day of selling Stew can that be indicative of open next day. I have heart traders talk about this but I have also seen stocks with huge volume at end of a trading down big. Just want some more thoughts on this
339 2018-10-01 21:28:28 Arturia keysteps are constantly out of stock in my country, I keep thinking there's this leprechaun with stocks upon stocks of 'em, pimping them out for questionable favors.
340 2018-10-01 21:28:21 The point being, an immoral and uncivil person will accomplish their goal regardless of resources available. Ban a bump stock and a slide stock will take its place. Even if you successfully eliminate all bump stocks a person can find a way to kill others.
341 2018-10-01 21:27:56 Once I get the hang of these stocks. I ain’t gonna work no more 
342 2018-10-01 21:27:02 Thanks blood who woulda thought mannequin stocks exist

348 2018-10-01 21:24:31 Yeah, money can be lot's of fun. Especially when it's real. :) I used TO LOVE playing Sun and other stocks when I was in my late 20s. Lucrative.

369 2018-10-01 21:14:32 You've allowed bump stocks to remain on the market for a year. Who knows how many have been sold to future killers. Maybe they'll kill first responders, maybe they'll kill cops, maybe they'll kill teachers.

You're weak on murder.
Weak on rape.
Weak on child incarceration.

373 2018-10-01 21:13:47 I expect a lot out of stocks in this cycle--I expect them to go down a great deal! We can argue 2000 valuations vs. current valuations until we're blue in the face, but there are also numerous behavioral markers that currently suggest extreme froth just like 2000.
374 2018-10-01 21:13:36 Market Close: MBS -2bps; DOW +192.90; NASDAQ -9.05; S&P 500 +10.61; 10yr Treasury 3.08%; Stocks end in Mixed Territory, while MBS retreats abit and end in Negative Territory.

376 2018-10-01 21:13:19 Huge demand for gold and bitcoin, both trade at a premium in Iran. But stocks offer a non-linear hedge, much better
377 2018-10-01 21:12:18 @lc_stocks
378 2018-10-01 21:12:14 Thanks. Hundreds of would be Democrats rush out to but Schiff approved Bump Stocks.
379 2018-10-01 21:11:40 It was an ugly day in biotechs but remember to add good quality stocks like $vktx $amrn etc on any pullback because they will bounce. Lot of negativity on twitter and bashers in full mode, i personally don’t care what they say as Iam sticking to my DD and has done great so far.
380 2018-10-01 21:11:39 Guy has turned are country around. More jobs, stocks up more $$ in my pockets.  The media wont tell you that tho.  They did tell you how he had 0 a chance to win.

383 2018-10-01 21:10:02 I mean, I'm not shocked...but I still haven't received a call, 48 hours later. Noticed that $SHLD closed at under $1 again. Good customer service keeps businesses open. Bad customer service crashes stocks.
384 2018-10-01 21:10:02 So on average every year have illegals or bump stocks killed more Americans? I know the answer, you know the answer, but yall need the votes so you must support the illegals!

399 2018-10-01 21:06:21 All I learned today was to avoid momentum stocks because there is no momentum out there.
400 2018-10-01 21:06:16 Didn't Trump promise to stop the sale of bump stocks? Yes, but he did nothing he just kissed the NRA's as#
401 2018-10-01 21:06:02 Interesting and surprising that the NRA has said they do not oppose banning bump stocks.

410 2018-10-01 21:03:00 One year later and you can still buy bump stocks in many states. All the talk of banning them at the federal level was just that...talk. The NRA is a terrorist organization. #VegasStrong

Libertarian/Authoritarian: Enforcers of left OR right wing PC codes, as well as anyone who deliberately puts two spaces after a period or fails to use an Oxford Comma, should be placed in stocks, forced to wear dunce hats, or otherwise publicly shamed.

427 2018-10-01 20:58:48 Not gonna get too excited....a year ago bump stocks were going to be outlawed.
428 2018-10-01 20:56:55 There’s a reason we train people for the army. There’s a reason citizens aren’t the army. Mob mentality. Founding Fathers didn’t like democracy became of the rebellion in France. Everyone should be capable of defense against gvnmt, though. And what about bump stocks?
429 2018-10-01 20:55:58 can we discuss about your book published near January, 2018, something called 75 hidden gems. Almost all stocks were up sharply before said book published & now return tune to (-)25% to (-)90%.
430 2018-10-01 20:55:45 It would be massive for all US MJ stocks! $TRUL probably with the most upside. With CAN MJ, early days (2015-2017) it was hard to buy a cannabis stock that would lose you money in the long term. To avoid picking $EMC of US though, I'm going with a wide variety of US MJ stocks
431 2018-10-01 20:55:29 He keeps going back to BTC bc it is the sector leader. If you look at the daily charts of every crypto currency, 98% of them look exactly like the Bitcoin chart. It's like watching $SPY to anticipate the other stocks moves. There is always correlation.
432 2018-10-01 20:54:50 Pot stocks October 
433 2018-10-01 20:54:13 Agree, I should have sold 50% of stock near the 2007 peak and 50% of bitcoin near the 2017 peak. It is so hard to tell yourself not to be too greedy, don't gamble too much, and sell 50% or all of your stocks when they double.
434 2018-10-01 20:53:57 @hammerandnigel is it a big investment opportunity or should everyone sell their stocks in that company?
435 2018-10-01 20:53:37 I entered the stockmarket, just to maximize the losses i already attained at the casino. Yes i accidentally invested in both US and CAN versions of the same companies, but hey, it’s just debt money! #finances #stocks #money 
436 2018-10-01 20:53:15 Psht. Pot stocks and crypto

438 2018-10-01 20:52:15 Watching you checking your stocks is hot
439 2018-10-01 20:51:26 Man i totally forgot i invested in certain stocks and my phone rang off and yah boy is happy now
440 2018-10-01 20:50:20 I'm interested in seeing the data you have of massive amounts of people being killed by guns that use bump stocks. Now is the time to share it for all to see. Also, the NRA promotes gun safety, not gun violence. Stop being a sheep.
441 2018-10-01 20:50:07 Did I hear @realDonaldTrump say bumb stocks are done? In three weeks? He checked with his lawyer (wtf) and said it's a long process, but they are done. Follow up?
442 2018-10-01 20:50:06 I have a small long position in $MPXEF. The reason it trails other cannabis stocks is its capital structure. The convertibles have caused a 100M share overhang.

445 2018-10-01 20:48:54 It's not my proposal, I was correcting your LIE about state income tax. 
The GOP cries about "job-killing" taxes & regs but did these big corporations create a lot of new jobs with their latest tax breaks or did they buy back stocks to make themselves richer? (Hint: the latter)
446 2018-10-01 20:48:12 Yeah, I wouldn't expect much out of stocks until the next cycle. The tax cuts really prolonged the rally, and probably extrapolated a little too much.
447 2018-10-01 20:48:06 October.  This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks. 

The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August and February.

#October
448 2018-10-01 20:46:21 World stocks higher: US +.4%; Europe +.2%. Trade agreement with Canada spurred stocks. No progress with China but investors seem unworried. Stocks best bet long-term even with interest-rates sure to rise over next 15 months.  If possible avoid bond-proxy stocks like utilities.
449 2018-10-01 20:45:55 Remember and do something about bump stocks.

453 2018-10-01 20:44:00 Catalysts are uplisting, any deals and the 17th. It’s pot stocks which nobody really knows where the valuation will actually end up. Set a stop limit, be patient. 
454 2018-10-01 20:44:00 Better make a separate watchlist for all #marijuana & #cbd stocks. Going to be an interesting fall this season
455 2018-10-01 20:43:58 Every year illegals kill more than 10x the number of people that all rifles combined do. Not just bump stocks, or assult rifles, all rifles combined. Yet, yall love illegals. If bump stocks could vote blue, you'd love them too.
456 2018-10-01 20:43:47 I don´t think you can trade FX and stocks/indices same time. You got to specialise on one class. Metals would be another class.

464 2018-10-01 20:41:17 Trump keeps the promises he makes. The Democrats said if Trump became President the stocks would crash and the economy would tank. It’s been a year and a half a they continue to grow. The highest ever. The Dems are running out of excuses.

466 2018-10-01 20:41:00 The options market is the bubble, corruption is rampant.  Borrow $$ @ 3%/yr, and write one month calls on a volatile stock like Tesla for 15+%/mth, or buy stock of more vol. co.'s, like cannabis stocks, NBEV/IGC/TLRY, the more vol. the more $$ the MM make = bubble.
467 2018-10-01 20:40:46 Get with the program.  The money went to the big ones that didn't share it with workers.  It went to buy back stocks.  Look it up for God's sake.
468 2018-10-01 20:40:43 You have so much money you fool. Why are you prolonging this storm you started.

You could have made much more money investing in stocks anyway why not go do that instead of all these failed businesses.

Russia can't save you forever.
469 2018-10-01 20:40:15 There must be no "grandfather" clause. All bump stocks must be turned in and destroyed, and there must be penalties for not turning them in.
470 2018-10-01 20:39:54 I strongly agree - both Stocks and Real Estate have had the Store of Value bestowed upon them by Central Banks. This is not appropriate. Neither of these assets are "stores of Value" They are businesses. Much greater value will be held in an Honest Money than Dishonest money.
471 2018-10-01 20:39:45 Pink yarn stocks have gone up?
472 2018-10-01 20:39:36 Stocks denominated in bitcoin that give bitcoin dividends (stocks of companies that have 100% of their revenue in bitcoin) could be very appealing to investors compared to bitcoin itself. These stocks will eventually become the norm, post-hyperbitcoinization.
473 2018-10-01 20:39:03 Anyone with stocks or bonds in Canada would be shooting themselves in the foot. Auto sector tarrifs would have caused a Canadian recession.
474 2018-10-01 20:38:59 UM remember Trump shaking the hands of children in school shooting and promising them he would ban Bump Stocks.  MSM doesn't even report this anymore.
475 2018-10-01 20:38:43 Congress could have banned bump stocks in 5 days in 2017 and dealt with the red tape later!

477 2018-10-01 20:38:31 There's no difference between this and NAFTA. Stocks went up because they now know that it's business as usual again.

486 2018-10-01 20:36:09 Trump said today, one year after Las Vegas massacre, that bump-fire stocks would be banned "over the next couple of weeks."
Right after he releases his tax returns?
487 2018-10-01 20:35:39 What makes no sense.  We are better under Trump my stocks are thru the roof!  How are yours?  Dems run SHITHOLES.  Not one successful city.

489 2018-10-01 20:34:48 At least we got bump stocks banned, oh, wait,
490 2018-10-01 20:34:47 @michaelsantoli  I heard you say today that politics didn’t have big effect on stock market. Really???Don’t you think anti-business Elizabeth Warren would tank stocks with her liberal socialistic stance??? You & Rick are the best but CNBC on a slide.

494 2018-10-01 20:33:32 You’re assuming that no other stocks will dilute?When it comes time to build a mill, dilution occurs. Tell me a stock has 2M In the Bank with no mill and scattered resources isn’t going to dilute.  The ones that get picked off by a company with an adjacent mill won’t. Guess who?

498 2018-10-01 20:32:59 This is one of the reasons I avoid Pharma stocks. They have way more risk than a majority of other stocks.
499 2018-10-01 20:32:58 One year since the Las Vegas Shooting, a year since we lost 58 innocent lives. Families are still grieving, Victims are still healing and we are still fighting. And one year later the Department of Justice has moved ahead on a ban on bump stocks. Never stop fighting #VegasStrong
500 2018-10-01 20:32:45 Increase the quota? - the latest scientific advice is to limit the mackerel catch as stocks are low! How do you equate that with increased quota.
501 2018-10-01 20:32:38 I would like to see the information the WH supposedly has gathered to outlaw bump stocks. It's revolting that so many families are suffering because of the stranglehold the NRA has on the GOP. Shame on you. #VoteBlue

504 2018-10-01 20:31:36 WHY ARE BUMP STOCKS STILL LEGAL? #NoRA
#VoteBlue2018 #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
505 2018-10-01 20:31:23 I remember. I remember that the US President ignored the massacre for weeks because the murderer was a white man. I remember he promised to ban bump stocks in two weeks and it's been a year.
506 2018-10-01 20:31:19 I don't even do stocks and from what I understand...

He bought Pharma stock because he friend said it was a good idea and then the stock promptly fell in value shortly after his purchase showing a large dip on the graph.
507 2018-10-01 20:30:59 The key to #investing success is putting money to work through owning #stocks of strong companies that either fundamentally transform people’s lives and disrupt the way businesses operate or that take advantage of macroeconomic trends, such as aging and/or growing populations.
508 2018-10-01 20:30:53 Cannibis stocks are not good investments, I almost fell for it. I thought...weed, man a lot of stupid people like that shit which means $$$, but after investigating further the market is less than lucrative.
509 2018-10-01 20:30:49 The whole fishing industry should be working to make things safer and cleaner if they want to preserve their stocks imo.
510 2018-10-01 20:30:48 #Stocks reaching new highs: $EC, $ROKU, $PINC. $OKTA is very strong, too. $GPRK looks good. #Oil and #healthcare stocks are showing strong behavior.
511 2018-10-01 20:30:31 The surprise in the #stocks report was #corn feeding was down 90 mln bu. in the last quarter, despite record animal numbers.
512 2018-10-01 20:30:10 Wahahaha! Di ko naman ibuhos eh iinumin ko pangpa angel daw yun. Naubusan ako stocks hahah
513 2018-10-01 20:29:21 #TopStory .@realDonaldTrump suggested today, one year after the #LasVegasShooting, that bump-fire stocks would be banned "over the next couple of weeks." @KWKTFOX44
514 2018-10-01 20:28:43 A lot of known IBD #growth #stocks showing a breakdown in price. Look at your watchlists and find the stocks which shows a positive close.
515 2018-10-01 20:28:01 Here we see the wild fitness man as he prepares for winter, whilst most mammals will wear warm clothing and eat red meat. The fitness man stocks up on protein powder and smoothies
516 2018-10-01 20:27:02 Energy stocks trying to BO today..."MRO, MU, NRG, HES, etc...
517 2018-10-01 20:26:59 Puedes poner en Google "SM entertainment stocks" y te sale la situación de las mismas con la posibilidad de revisar por fecha y hora su estado.
518 2018-10-01 20:26:58 The fascistic, homophobic Bud Lite commercials are my pet peeve. Dissent and individualism (expressed by effeminate men) punished with the Pit of Misery or time in the stocks. Pretty ugly, autocratic sentiment, but fit for the times we have now.
519 2018-10-01 20:26:51 Another one that I am looking forwards to seeing in the stocks. Murdoch whore.
520 2018-10-01 20:26:00 Parecida a la de finales de julio , esperemos que mañana toque fondo y remonte . Pero pinta feo cuando los índices principales no lo están haciendo mal . Muchísimos market leaders hasta ahora bajando muchísimo hoy .
521 2018-10-01 20:25:57 My sources are saying buy cannabis stocks. . Lol. Have a great Monday.
522 2018-10-01 20:25:54 @tedforbes I'm curious if you have any recommended reading or videos that cover the characteristics of popular film stocks throughout the years? I recently watched your Film Look with adjustments video & it has me wanting to learn more about the common film stocks...
523 2018-10-01 20:25:13 The fascistic, homophobic Bud Lite commercials are my pet peeve. Dissent and individualism (expressed by effeminate men) punished with the Pit of Misery or time in the stocks. Pretty ugly sentiment, but fit for the times we have now.
524 2018-10-01 20:25:04 If Las Vegas intervened and demanded the ban on bump stocks, it could happen.
525 2018-10-01 20:24:45 really don’t have no one to speak stocks with 
526 2018-10-01 20:24:11 Sorry byron.. have you thought of just buying delivery stocks? like Deutsche post or ups? 
Christmas season :D
527 2018-10-01 20:23:55 Had to pop into @Clicks_SA for a few toiletries. Looked out for the 3 for the price of 2 deals that make a sensible buy. My huge stocks of moisturizers, earbuds and toothbrushes that used to be bought for me are all finished. One swallows hard when one has to fend for one's self.
528 2018-10-01 20:23:48 No one gives a fuck about Tesla and their stocks. Tired of seeing all this shit lmao
529 2018-10-01 20:23:48 Trade deals re-negotiated with Mexico, Canada, EU, South Korea, Japan, China next, that’s the big one. Should be overall positive for country. 4% GDP, housing strong, stocks up. Much to the dismay of the left who can’t admit when they’re wrong and give credit where due.

532 2018-10-01 20:22:17 Ferrari-Lamborghini-Bugatti stocks will go through the roof..
533 2018-10-01 20:21:55 Ya right. Check the stocks. $gm $f
534 2018-10-01 20:21:28 I have Robinhood and noticed I can’t get stocks I like why is that and what would be the best one to get I have about 4K in Robinhood
535 2018-10-01 20:21:18 The important distinction is that there is -enough- to set a bid price way above where it should be when it comes to stocks as those.
536 2018-10-01 20:21:03 Alcohol stocks dropped 67 percent when Ole Ted went belly up.
537 2018-10-01 20:20:40 What about S&P breadth? What about EM losses -20% ytd. Banking stocks selling off? $FB $GOOG pressure? $TSLA if unable to role debt in Oct could be the candle to highlight zombie companies unable to pay forward debts.
538 2018-10-01 20:20:31 U.S. President Donald Trump said on the anniversary of the 2017 Las Vegas deadly shooting that his administration is close to finalizing a regulation that would ban bump stocks, a device that can allow a gun to fire at speeds that mimic an automatic weapon.
539 2018-10-01 20:20:11 RT @EricBoehlert: Trump lying abt bump stocks.   

it's been one year since the Las Vegas massacre. claims his hands are tied.  

GOP Congress could've outlawed bump stocks in 5 days.
540 2018-10-01 20:19:15 the meme economy is dwindling. i’m selling my stocks.
541 2018-10-01 20:19:11 I think it's worth pointing out small-caps relative to large caps are right in the middle of their range for the year as well as for past few years. Underperformance alone is not bearish imo. Remember small-caps underperformed all of 2017, a great year for stocks $IWM $DJIA $SPX
542 2018-10-01 20:17:44 TIL. I work with a lot of people that 1. Do not know what the prime rate is. 2. Don’t know how stocks work.
543 2018-10-01 20:17:13 Look on the congressional website and see the bills related to banning bump stocks. They didn’t even make it out of the committees. Congressmembers in the house and senate have wrote legislation to ban them, and they didn’t go to the floor for a vote.
544 2018-10-01 20:16:49 Yep! It’s the same FBI, who still hasn’t told us what really happened in Las Vegas 1yr ago today! But hey, bump stocks will soon be off the market, because apparently that’s what really matters?!Anyone who knows anything about guns, knows u don’t need a bump stock to bump fire!
545 2018-10-01 20:16:29 Let's do something real for these people. Let's ban bump stocks and semi-automatic assault rifles, and large ammo clips. #Enough #GunSenseNow
546 2018-10-01 20:15:59 $HON, DWDP. Real stocks with real balance sheets and catalysts. Tesla is fun though. I like your tweets and know you have declared a position. Respect for that.
547 2018-10-01 20:15:44 Stocks end broadly lower despite gains in some blue chips on trade pact with Canada. Dow +192, +0.7% to 26,651, S&P +0.4%. But Nasdaq -0.1% and Russell 2000 hammered -1.4%.

First day of new qtr affected trading moves. Still, losers top winners 2 to 1 on Nasdaq, 3/2 NYSE. Harsh!
548 2018-10-01 20:15:36 Their stocks went up dhsjslalsmsje
549 2018-10-01 20:15:23 but nice play though between 200 sma and 50sma monthly. kudos
closed below monthly 50sma.
interesting to see what happens this week. and next..

take profit, keep calm,  best mantra i guess with $tsla like stocks!
550 2018-10-01 20:14:10 @POTUS 58 lives taken in moments. Ban bump stocks. Do something. Be useful. Back up your big talk with action.
551 2018-10-01 20:13:42 stocks rise by 1%.
552 2018-10-01 20:12:51 I recall you recommending casino stocks, people lose everything to gambling and gambling addiction. Stay consistent if you want to play the moral high ground...
553 2018-10-01 20:11:59 You think bump stocks are the cause of the massacre?  Please tell me?
554 2018-10-01 20:11:49 And it isn't bold nor brave for you to feign such praise for these people while supporting bump stocks, much less any kind of reasonable gun law reform that would help prevent such a massacre. Tone deaf.
555 2018-10-01 20:11:47 As for Apple News, Voice Memos and Stocks in Mojave. They are all apps I will possibly never use.
556 2018-10-01 20:09:48 Do you even realize how bad your shareholders are taking a beaten during your vow of silence? Aphria is the laughing stock of stocks it can get out of its own way
557 2018-10-01 20:09:36 Lol. @AndrewGillum made it from progressive to full blown centrist in a mere couple of weeks. What did it take? Promises of Onward Together Hillary funds, an offshore account,stocks of defense contractors that enable #Palestine #Yemen Genocide or the coveted 2019 AIPAC speech
558 2018-10-01 20:08:53 Small-cap stocks, one of the winners from the trade war, take a tumble on NAFTA deal. Russell 2000 falls 1.4%, worst day since late July

562 2018-10-01 20:07:04 I made $44 from my stocks today. I’m proud. Lol
563 2018-10-01 20:06:34 Bullish a lot of stocks this week did you see $NVDA last few days? $MSFT slow and steady. $SPY not sure how to handle news, tariffs baked in both directions? $FB heading down though might be taking $TWTR with it. Keeping an eye on $HD and $NKE.

569 2018-10-01 20:04:45 i know i'm sick but i think starting to invest in stocks right now would be a good idea but also i'mv ery much too tired to start that
570 2018-10-01 20:04:40 お腹すいたしマクドナルド開店凸ありだな？
571 2018-10-01 20:04:26 ... If you spent as much time investing in stocks as you do reading about them, you could both rich and heart and in real life
572 2018-10-01 20:04:22 With several positive catalysts and one big negative catalyst (Fed raise) now behind, I think we're going to get some fundamental idea of where Mr. Market wants to go. High beta stocks already peeling off.
573 2018-10-01 20:03:53 Who cares? 80% don’t have stocks
574 2018-10-01 20:03:04 Speaking of....why did it take the stroke of a pen to put babies in cages but banning bump stocks takes over a year?  

As he said today.
575 2018-10-01 20:02:55 The Obama Admin approved "bump stocks" for weapons but Democrats seek to obfuscate their culpability with meaningless rhetoric while throwing stones & wanting to murder full term baby's.
576 2018-10-01 20:02:11 International stocks have outperformed the Dow, S&P, midcaps, & small caps since the middle of September.
577 2018-10-01 20:02:00 Jajajajajajaj a pero así ...XDD
578 2018-10-01 20:01:38 Tal cual . Que día mas raro .
579 2018-10-01 20:01:35 Buena informacion
580 2018-10-01 20:01:15 JUST THE FACTS: According to Mark Twain, October is a particularly dangerous month to speculate in stocks.  The others are January, April, July, November, February, May, December, March, June, August and September.
581 2018-10-01 20:00:54 It's been a year since the mass shooting in Las Vegas. @KenCalvert said that he would ban bump stocks. He hasn't. Why? Because he receives more money from the NRA than any other sitting member of Congress from California. If we want gun reform, we have to vote for @peacock4ca42.
582 2018-10-01 19:59:24 Some stocks and actions you take make you look smarter than you really are.. closed long on $PRNB right at peak. Shorted $AMRN at 18s  and $ICPT  short at day's high. Closed bit early at 128 fearing a bounce
583 2018-10-01 19:59:23 Actually I recall reading a book by Peter Lynch where he talked about being a Looper on a nice course as a kid. Listening and observing.  It simplified my approach to stocks. So when Frank started vomiting stock symbols I thought couldn't hurt to look into.... it didn't. Haha
584 2018-10-01 19:59:22 That is so incredible ;0 But in a strange kinda way also so exciting :P
585 2018-10-01 19:58:47 NASDAQ lol - you can't trust any strong open or close - this is why I almost never day trade anymore, along with being too busy - but I'm glad for that b/c long is the ONLY way to go. Cheers. #Stocks
586 2018-10-01 19:58:41 You can go lecture the Pentagon about it, but I'm sure every top brass general or military man there got some stocks in wacky tobaccy and marijuana farms overseas. They got dealings with big pharmaceutical companies and kingpins in big urban cities. It's all about money.
587 2018-10-01 19:58:34 That's the Relative Strength you talk about!  Thanks for keeping us in the quality stocks :)

595 2018-10-01 19:52:50 Great. Quick question. What do you think about Trump getting ridbof the bump stocks?

598 2018-10-01 19:52:23 just went long $TSLA at 310  it one of the only games in town... along with $NVDA 2 up stocks and will stay  "UP" stocks
599 2018-10-01 19:52:10 Just crude! I guess shale stocks are on fire now!
600 2018-10-01 19:51:59 Funny how -$100 feels ok after a -$1000 day. $OGEN $IGC $NBEV. These stocks are not easy to trade you chase you die. Every time i think they are done they rip for more. Felt great to be back with @TraderEquity today with good software and fills.
601 2018-10-01 19:51:24 Had 40% accuracy today trading the choppy pot stocks but ended the day well in the green thanks to controlling losses. I've said this 100 times and I'll say it 100 more times.. Risk managment is f***ing KING! $IGC $NBEV $TLRY $LEVB
602 2018-10-01 19:51:22 $MS on March 9th, 2018 had a price of $58.04, now trading at $46.57 which is a ($11.47) or (20%) decrease from earlier in the year. 

Morgan Stanley has steadily been decreasing, as has most bank stocks.
603 2018-10-01 19:51:06 @realcrizzy need the blueprint on the stocks and investing bro.
604 2018-10-01 19:50:54 Those are Canadian and up because of NAFTA. Also, neither is anywhere close to their 52-week highs let alone where the energy stocks should be with crude now back to $75-$85.
605 2018-10-01 19:50:39 thanks for the honesty, weed stocks are unstoppable, scalping was better this time
606 2018-10-01 19:49:54 All the best. Also, are you trading stocks of Energy companies? Such as $WLL $CLR $MRO $OAS ... or just commodity itself?
607 2018-10-01 19:49:09 Hey. The #CAD is ‘soaring’ stocks’re up.

*shrugs*

Don’t know ‘bout anybuddy else, but I’m more than good with that. 


#USMCA
608 2018-10-01 19:48:48 So far, the saga in Italy has not flowed into the US Treasury mkt...and its odd with the (admittedly muted) weakness in US stocks today, bonds didn't seem to notice.
609 2018-10-01 19:48:21 @tradingbot And we could get there. In that scenario I think we'd see a lot more upside than a $1.  But $100 oil hasn't been good for stocks
610 2018-10-01 19:48:12 There's a host of academic research backing this up as well. Low beta stocks tend to outperform before the peak of the cycle as investors increasingly de-risk. Somewhat related as well is the fact that momentum (i.e high risk) stocks perform horribly in recessions
611 2018-10-01 19:48:05 Pretty nasty loss, though these stocks are crazy. I know you'll bounce back stronger like you did with that 100k day
612 2018-10-01 19:46:45 google videos of people testing bump firing without one.,it's really inconsistent and takes practice. If it was so easy people wouldnt buy bump stocks. Use your head.
613 2018-10-01 19:46:34 Today I made some money playing $IGC and $NBEV long. I try to not have a bias either way. I will play long, I will play short. Its the dumb 'fundamental' shorts that get destroyed in stocks like these
614 2018-10-01 19:46:18 Effective today Bump Stocks are illegal in Maryland.
615 2018-10-01 19:45:52 Matt Matt Matt, again with the lies,I post on multiple stocks not just $weyl and my entry point is much much lower so I’m under zero pressure & re your legal prowess, you obviously weren’t/aren’t very good otherwise you would be practicing instead of living at home with your mum
616 2018-10-01 19:44:51 Didn’t Trump promise to ban Bump stocks?
617 2018-10-01 19:44:44 Some stocks went up and some went down. Trading the averages is hard. We try not to do it.
618 2018-10-01 19:44:43 When Apple understands Messages = Productivity not Social Networking, stocks will collapse
619 2018-10-01 19:44:38 how many cannabis related stocks do you own?  15+ ?
620 2018-10-01 19:44:30 Lying should never be permitted, you’re right. I would say that coming out after you said one thing, with another thing to cancel it, wouldn’t really be lying about it. It would take congress to actually ban bump stocks, not the justice department.

622 2018-10-01 19:44:13 Pres. Trump just discussed bump stocks this morning at a press meeting at the White House. It's about to be legally banned any week now; it took 6 months of democrat regulations to get to this point. Have a nice day!
623 2018-10-01 19:43:12 my parents have been so adamant about it but that’s what I’m afraid of lol. My stocks went down a while ago, and then went back up. So I’m not toooo worried about it.
624 2018-10-01 19:43:05 Flippers
625 2018-10-01 19:42:54 This “proposed” rule “would ban” bump stocks.  It won’t ever go into place.
626 2018-10-01 19:42:25 A lot of stocks are closing ugly

641 2018-10-01 19:38:10 The amount of selling in the bottom 1500 of the Russell 2000 must be vigorous in order to offset the heavy market cap weight of the top 500 stocks also in the S&P 500.  Passive investings ugly stepchild...

645 2018-10-01 19:36:32 Because fundamentally and technically speaking that is a stock to be shorted and also many people are specialised in shorting stocks other than longing. Also it’s full of traps, not even easier to go long.

Weapons of war are not. They use fully automatics in war.

ARs are not assault weapons. They are semi.

Bump stocks can go. Those are not necessary or wise.

674 2018-10-01 19:24:47 The Democrats have no love for the US Constitution. They will seek and destroy anyone that is not for their agenda. We have soaring stocks, and historically low unemployment, but they say we are failing.

676 2018-10-01 19:23:51 Yes, we must remember Las Vegas.
We must also remember that since then even bump stocks are still legal.
We must remember the republicans have done absolutely nothing to protect us.

700 2018-10-01 19:16:32 It's really simple to avoid trouble on stocks like $NBEV $IGC, all you have to do is just DON'T DO ANYTHING if you feel like something is not right with the way it trades (i.e. grinds, chop, manipulation, etc...)

758 2018-10-01 18:53:09 Oney always known this means something is happening but what does this exactly mean? We haven't sacked him yet. Are the stocks down because of how we're doing on the pitch or because news of him being sacked or him nearing a sack has seeped through?
759 2018-10-01 18:52:57 Shameful but America is paying about same with new tax law & allowed deductions.

760 2018-10-01 18:52:26 @FloRacing with the coverage of Super Dirt Week, are you only showing Big Blocks? Or do we get to see Sportsman, Pro Stocks, and Small Blocks?
761 2018-10-01 18:51:55 You know, I passed on the chance to buy stocks in the Perrier Bottle Mascot Costume Company and I am regretting that today. #kanye
762 2018-10-01 18:51:43 @Neha_trade what is the fate of BEPL, PRAKASH & WATERBASE. Is it a good time to enter in these stocks?

764 2018-10-01 18:51:07 Get a handful of stocks and watch their every move for weeks and see what their interday activity looks like on a daily basis. How low/high do they move and how long do they stay at those spots for. When you understand exactly when they move and to what price they move-you buy
765 2018-10-01 18:51:06 Stocks are like your ex girlfriend...when you breakup (sell) it seems more beautiful than ever.

766 2018-10-01 18:50:28 Next time you feel inclined to send a large donation to a political campaign, maybe consider a charity, instead?  How about Shriner's Childrens' Hospital or Charity Water?  Maybe that will actually make a real difference in peoples' lives.  Politicians always seem to have enough.
767 2018-10-01 18:50:05 It’s one of those stocks where you can’t have an uncomfortable amount of money in it, and you just have to ignore the horrific pullbacks.

770 2018-10-01 18:48:50 My proposition to end the sales of bump stocks is removal of the commercial sales and import embargo of automatic firearms and a reduction of the tax stamp upon them from $200 to $5. (the tax stamp is really just a formality in the registration process)
771 2018-10-01 18:48:34 The first thing I think is how your hero President has done absolutely fuck all to stop these things happening in a daily basis...it’s taken him a year to make a decision on bump stocks...a year...it should have taken a day at most

775 2018-10-01 18:48:14 $SRPT They are loosening the stocks from the weak-handed. Hand over all the shares you can give up. Wrote enough puts this week to choke a horse. OK, please do not report me to PETA.
776 2018-10-01 18:45:51 What are you doing to stop the next Vegas masacre? Why are bump stocks still legal? Why are AR-15s still legal? How much did you get from the NRA? 

#VegasStrong #VoteBlue2018
777 2018-10-01 18:45:43 Wait....aren’t you the No Regulations guy @realDonaldTrump ? Now, you’re blaming regulations for why you’re so SLOW on doing more to eliminate bump stocks and save lives? Makes absolutely no sense.

785 2018-10-01 18:42:44 Two men living in the same city, both make 70k a year, both invest 10% of their annual income. One man logically invest his 7k annually into index funds, real estate, and stocks, while the other emotionally gives his 7k annually to his church....
786 2018-10-01 18:42:36 Invest in stocks
787 2018-10-01 18:41:49 High quality stocks.....needs a  bit of clarification. High quality stocks don't correct much.
788 2018-10-01 18:41:41 No, no crash. We are at ATH in US stocks with ultra low unemployment and a strong dollar. Interest rates are moving up in the face of an economy that continues to strengthen. The United States Of America is strong. You America haters have been proven to be 100% percent wrong!!
789 2018-10-01 18:41:31 so "bump stocks" is code for "trump regime"?
790 2018-10-01 18:41:28 1 chose simple : AMD > All (Y compris pour les stocks )
791 2018-10-01 18:40:46 Nasdaq is tanking while the S&P and DOW are holding without issues.  FB and I guess other tech/biotech stocks must be leading the way down.
792 2018-10-01 18:39:59 "We buy stocks the way we buy toilet paper: high quality, on sale, and in bulk sizes." - Allan Mecham
793 2018-10-01 18:38:58 I have not really tested it on crypto... but its fairly decent with stocks.... it can definetly be improved upon....
794 2018-10-01 18:38:19 Chart is dying to breakdown,
795 2018-10-01 18:38:03 Cheers... enough stocks already collected
796 2018-10-01 18:37:58 stocks were looking HOT at the beginning of the day... shoulda short sold instead of buying more. still ain’t losin’ money tho 
797 2018-10-01 18:37:35 Like many, I don’t watch NRATV (even though I past hosted it) - no longer funny, no talent or charm. It is just a political ad Bump Stocks. Word is that Dana Loesch, who put on a MAGA hat after the show (despite being told “no”), was great. She’s leading the charge!
798 2018-10-01 18:37:08 And so “Don’t Boo”“Hiccup” Heller (R-Adelson) celebrates one year of doing absolutely nothing about assault weapons, bump stocks, background checks for domestic abusers, the mentally ill, even terrorists. America’s most mediocre senator couldn’t even react to a Nevadan tragedy.
799 2018-10-01 18:36:40 $TRPX possible move here as other stocks in this sector boomed today. Watch!
800 2018-10-01 18:36:34 James Bond tries to stop the Ooufu Alliance, who is planning to use stolen information to devalue stocks.
801 2018-10-01 18:36:16 Look at how twisted the News is. The stocks rally but the highlight is Trump not answering Kavanaugh questions. Man.
802 2018-10-01 18:35:36 With an aging population, conceding on drug costs with the new trade deal was extremely myopic.  Quotas on car production isn't a success, it's just a lesser of the evils vs tariffs.  Hence why stocks recovered slightly.  Spinjob.
803 2018-10-01 18:35:33 Your liberal ignorance is showing Bill. Stop being offended. Try to report on the news we have a new trade deal with Canada. Stocks all time High. Great economy. Nope you would rather report news with a spin, otherwise known at #fakenews

I have worked since I was a kid.  I'm a proud employee of a company I love, I own two small businesses, and I trade stocks.

Capitalism is my best friend!
806 2018-10-01 18:34:37 Bump stocks are junk and don't even work most of the time. Also, they can't be used on many AR rifles because their barrels aren't made for rapid fire - they overheat. That's why the #LasVegasShooter had several rifles in his room. Banning them accomplishes nothing. #2A #tcot

809 2018-10-01 18:33:39 Just bc you don’t like bump stocks doesn’t mean it was made to kill people. There are literally thousands of them and only one person used it to kill other people.

811 2018-10-01 18:32:55 Companies don't grow at 40% on an individual basis. There has to be a sector tailwind for which such stocks are the leaders. - Basant Maheshwari
812 2018-10-01 18:32:44 I believe WA State has banned Bump Stocks
813 2018-10-01 18:32:42 One thing I can warn you about is, the markets have almost hit its peak, so don't dive in with more than you willing to lose. Buy more ETF's or Stocks after another global recession, hopefully late next year or 2020
814 2018-10-01 18:32:27 Nothing works for junk stocks, cyclical stocks that has high working capital should b approached with caution. Retail should always stick to consumer oriented, Non- cyclical.
815 2018-10-01 18:31:52 At midday, Stocks surging on new USMCA deal. Mortgage Bonds flat. 10-yr yield 3.07%.
816 2018-10-01 18:31:43 Sometimes its darkest just before it gets darker! I can't imagine any bonds being attractive in this world environment as opposed to inefficient stocks. Just think of it, US treasuries give no yield but mammoth risk. Return free risk!

820 2018-10-01 18:30:17 In stocks if i want to trade off the 5 support i can limit order 100 shares 5.05 let is go against me maybe to 4.90 because stops are being hit on the other side of 5...wait till the buyers step in to push it back above 5 and start adding size for the push higher.
821 2018-10-01 18:30:12 The latest behavioral pattern of stocks is stay stationary when Trump creates uncertainty. Use outcomes as extraordinary events to drive prices higher. Reminiscent of 1920s.
822 2018-10-01 18:30:06 Trade tariffs  nope  @Tesla stocks up after SEC settlement. @elonmusk please don’t smoke and tweet 
823 2018-10-01 18:29:41 ? Amazon is a money making machine, w/way too many underpaid employees. He may subsidize part of his income right now as it’s a feast 4 the wealthiest in the market bc of trump’s tax cuts & if u know what 2 do,but Amazon is bank rolling! 1 Trillion in profits! Not profits+stocks!
824 2018-10-01 18:29:41 The message is : it’s ok, we got this , all is under control !. Meanwhile they buy stocks on Tesla
825 2018-10-01 18:28:40 Doesn’t matter. People looking to do bad things will use things that aren’t created to do those bad things. Bump stocks aren’t made to kill people, but one person did use it to kill people.
826 2018-10-01 18:27:36 I have been tracking markets since DEC 2010
But all those corrections from 2010 is a BULL market corrections. A Bear market correction should take stocks back to 10, 13, 15, 20 year moving averages.
Need to b aware of both funda and technical to pick bottom
827 2018-10-01 18:27:00 I don't think this current #momentum/#bubble driven #cannabisstocks environment will end well for #investors or #traders. There will be GREAT opportunities to invest in cannabis-related #stocks. Q4 2018 isn't one them. $TLRY $CRBP $MJ

Obstructionist ass!
831 2018-10-01 18:25:25 You don't have stocks, bonds, or dividends

833 2018-10-01 18:24:19 Officially one year since the Las Vegas massacre and bump stocks are still legal. That's unconscionable @SenDeanHeller and lawmakers showing up at memorial events with nothing to offer should stay home.
834 2018-10-01 18:22:55 I don’t disagree. I would never go all in on gold and foreign stocks. You always have to have st least 30% exposure to us equities. Even if it looks like a bubble.
835 2018-10-01 18:22:20 Nasdaq is coming unglued as well. Choppy market and Dennis gartman is pumping US stocks again. Caution!!!!
836 2018-10-01 18:22:13 Just everything on my screen at dead lows,some stocks giving back 5 to 6% gains....
837 2018-10-01 18:21:48 Companies were already making record profits under Obama. They just used the tax scam to buy back stocks. All the middleclass tax breaks go away by law in 4 years. The ultra rich get to keep their tax breaks.
So the middle class and poor get to pay so the 1% can have more.
838 2018-10-01 18:20:47 Tax cut was a setup for stock buyback for CEOs and connected ppl to sell their stocks high. After buyback, who cares what comes next. Just like after so many ass kissing tweets, they don't care such ass kissing got laughed at in UN. Anyways, it was Trump was laughed at, not them.
839 2018-10-01 18:19:24 Stocks go up for the rich and gas prices go up for the rest...

844 2018-10-01 18:16:51 I continue to see more and more people join crypto each day. To me, that is a bullish sign that this ecosystem is growing so I will continue to buy more Bitcoins like how Warren B. buys more Coke stocks because he sees more and more people drink Coke globally.

855 2018-10-01 18:12:22 Yes 20k is farfetched but this isnt stocks it's the movement of money .. market cap doesnt mean a thing
856 2018-10-01 18:12:10 $1 invested into US large cap stocks back in 1926 would be worth $7,347 at the end of 2017, not too shabby.  If you invested into US small cap stocks, it would be worth $22,985 over the same time period.  Think you need small cap stocks in your portfolio?  Probably so... #markets

860 2018-10-01 18:09:41 Stocks are higher this morning on the news that Canada has joined the U.S. and Mexico in a trade agreement to replace NAFTA. The ISM national manufacturing index fell to 59.8, a little below the consensus of 60.0.
861 2018-10-01 18:09:41 Canadian law is "just like" American law only 77% as effective, one reason Canada is a haven for stocks fraud and international criminal money laundering. Our dear frozen Banana Republic to the north.

877 2018-10-01 18:04:06 Buying new highs in the Nasdaq is like Chasing the Dragon — but for stocks.
878 2018-10-01 18:04:04 Shorters are hardly investors.  They borrow stocks at a higher price and do all they can, within legal limits, to create downward pressure so they can make a profit.

882 2018-10-01 18:02:54 I have been working on 'Short Selling' set-ups. Took notes from 'Short-Selling with the O'Neil Disciples' & discovered a powerful set-up to short stocks. Will share it tomorrow.

Going to play from both sides soon.
883 2018-10-01 18:02:51 We're going to need something to add to the story to keep upward momentum going from this level though. Just citing low stocks isn't sufficient now. That "something" could be wx, prodx underperformance, etc. It just needs to come from somewhere.

889 2018-10-01 17:59:35 @FoxNews Stocks soar as Dems cringe. They are about to have the hammer drop on the scams they have pulled. they think the American people are damned fools and won't do anything. WRONG LIB!
890 2018-10-01 17:59:01 You lack of knowledge of guns and bump firing is disturbing. Now only the outlaws have bump stocks. 
Why not make it an add on penalty to a gun crime where a bump stock or other fire rate modification from stock is used? 
Punish bad behavior, not lawful citizens exercising rights
891 2018-10-01 17:58:13 @sahneydeepak good stocks for 3months investment?

893 2018-10-01 17:56:16 Hey, I don't care about "bump stocks" - had no use for one, so I'm okay with them being banned..... Disappointed?
894 2018-10-01 17:56:11 At midday, #Stocks surging on new USMCA deal. #Mortgage Bonds flat. 10-yr yield 3.07%.
895 2018-10-01 17:56:04 Given recent rulings in favor of bump stocks, it's surprising to see any pro-gun organization back away from defending these firearm components.
896 2018-10-01 17:55:41 Since it's October now, a year has passed since I got my professional certification on financial markets haha. I'm so into stocks and investment when I'm still in college, but I didn't even bother to continue pursuing the career after I graduated 
897 2018-10-01 17:55:12 YOU are a DISGUSTING LIAR.  HOW DARE YOU use this incident and the immense amount of sorrow associated with it to convey LIES to the American People.  PIG! You know damn well legislation is moving thru and bump stocks will be banned very soon!
898 2018-10-01 17:54:59 Bump stocks make a gun in accurate. And to date where Are the findings in THAT investigation huh?
899 2018-10-01 17:54:45 Thank you for your insights Rhom. I used to hold 80+ stocks for years and learnt the hard way that a few stocks drifting down in the background went unnoticed. Obviously, that ate into my returns. The numbers often built up after buying a basket of beaten up stocks in bear mkts.
900 2018-10-01 17:54:17 The 1970's Labour Governments had to rob the food stockpile kept for nuclear emergencies because of strikes, like the 1974 transport strike. The incoming Tory Government were forced to rebuild the stocks.
Just another effect of electing a Socialist Government.

905 2018-10-01 17:53:40 Constitutional rights. Ahahaha. Yes. So let’s just let everyone buy a gun, even if they’re not capable of handling it, because it’s in their rights. That seems like a stupid idea, cause there’s already requirements. Bump stocks, too. Nothing about that in the constitution.

1057 2018-10-01 17:00:01 It would be impossible to enforce. Bump stocks, whilst very effective, are actually incredibly simple. It would not be difficult to fabricate a comparable device. Expect stories about idiots blowing their feet off having tried.

1060 2018-10-01 16:58:20 I think it depends on how much you have. In my case I barely have $100k so 80-85% of it in stocks means i don't have much cash at all.
1061 2018-10-01 16:58:01 Not to defend the guy, but I believe bump stocks were legalized under the Obama admin. Not saying the Obama admin was in support of it, but it seems as if they didn’t try to fight it. Who knows, though.

1094 2018-10-01 16:50:08 AR15s with bump stocks are a lot of fun to shoot.  Those wishing to ban them have no concept about how quickly rounds can be fired from the same gun with standard 6 position stock.  I don’t really think they’ll ever be banned.
1095 2018-10-01 16:50:08 It's amazing how many people in the index industry don't understand the difference between benchmarking to an index (e.g., comparing your actively managed mutual fund to the S&P 500) and indexing (e.g., an ETF which tracks a index by owning the right stocks in the right ratio).
1096 2018-10-01 16:50:07 It has been a year now and what progress has been made, if any? I haven't heard a peep about bump stocks since shortly after the Las Vegas shootings.
1097 2018-10-01 16:49:55 Great so the US president takes guidance from you... but yes ban bump stocks
1098 2018-10-01 16:49:49 Shannon, did you see comments on bump stocks? Why is it taking a year? Could it have passed earlier? They are going to try do do something before midterms just to mislead their voters.

1113 2018-10-01 16:46:25 They’re banning bump stocks for obvious reasons and Mfs really out here planning on stocking up before the ban so they can jack the prices up and still sell them to people who want them

1131 2018-10-01 16:42:06 On the anniversary of the largest U.S. mass shooting to date, @realDonaldTrump says his administration is weeks away from banning Bump Stocks. #RememberVegas
1132 2018-10-01 16:41:56 Sir which stocks any names pls.......
1133 2018-10-01 16:41:47 Can anyone tell me what banning bump stocks has do with anything about stopping mass shootings.
1134 2018-10-01 16:41:28 ATF had already decided any rule on bump stocks could be successfully challenged.  Congress is once again handing off responsibility, quite possibly to keep that uncertainty alive.
1135 2018-10-01 16:41:27 .@realDonaldTrump You are lying through your teeth about bump stocks.  It does not take a year.  You are a pawn of the NRA.
1136 2018-10-01 16:41:02 President is claiming that he "knocking out bump stocks." He is either lying or naive. You can buy them today. Meaningful action requires a change of law. The ATF has been clear about that.

1138 2018-10-01 16:40:59 And the rubber band does a much better job that those stupid $349 bump stocks.  The slippery slope is the regulation of individual gun parts. That is the gun banners dream
1139 2018-10-01 16:40:31 A know I guy who has 100 guns who told the bump stocks “ are not right .”
1140 2018-10-01 16:40:28 Have you seen their personnel? Licht, Koetter and Smith need to go. Unpopular opinion here but Lovie at least had a defense that was competitive and the offense was growing in Winston’s first year. Koetter has no business being a HC. He’s 2 levels down from Norv Turner
1141 2018-10-01 16:40:07 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
1142 2018-10-01 16:39:57 It’s not actually going to change anything. Bump stocks don’t actually do anything to increase the rate of fire from a semi auto rifle. This is a feel good measure that won’t do anything
1143 2018-10-01 16:39:51 Everyone’s buying stocks and whatnot and I’m just sitting here like hmm do I eat ramen or spam this morning
1144 2018-10-01 16:39:48 I can't believe that BUMP STOCKS haven't been banned! Trump is such a BS artist. Right after the Parkland shooting he said he'd take care of Bump Stocks himself. He said it was easy & he'd do it right away. They haven't been banned & today his story changed, but he promised again
1145 2018-10-01 16:39:36 @realDonaldTrump It has taken a year and still you haven’t banned bump stocks. I call BS!!
1146 2018-10-01 16:39:31 I wonder how my buyers can still find my shop when I am not promoting it for now coz I only got few stocks left.. haha but still they can buy something..lol

1147 2018-10-01 16:39:15 @realDonaldTrump Just sent thoughts and prayers again to the victims and their families...but has not what he promised to even simply ban bump stocks. When will we learn? This is not democracy. The NRA owns our government. #VegasStrong

1150 2018-10-01 16:38:49 . @POTUS says that firearms’ “bump stocks” will soon be “out” (illegal) They now alow semi-automatic weapons to fire in rapid succession.
1151 2018-10-01 16:38:38 Bump fire is a technique the stocks were simply made to make it easier. If someone wanted to make one could easily do with wood and a drill and bob’s your uncle. Absolutely pointless ban and waste of time for optics.
1152 2018-10-01 16:38:38 They way people talk about bump stocks one would think they are routinely used. Most people calling for a ban on them have no idea what they really are or how they work. If you ever get the chance to use one do it.
1153 2018-10-01 16:38:23 Yep!! Along with 90% of stocks, less than half of the population are in the market. If your employees can't afford healthcare they probably can't afford to invest. A major reason the rich get richer disposable income. #MakeAmericaKind
1154 2018-10-01 16:38:14 it doesn't because it's not about what the spy does. it's about what the majority of stocks does.
1155 2018-10-01 16:37:58 The only reason that bump stocks are a thing, is because of the unconstitutional NFA.  Repeal that, and bump stocks go back to being irrelevant gizmos.

1157 2018-10-01 16:37:40 Trump just said in a matter of weeks that gun bump stocks will be illegal. He has been working to legally make that happen for nearly a year.
1158 2018-10-01 16:37:31 @AskRobinhood I can’t trade stocks and was unable to submit a help request via website. Please dm me .
1159 2018-10-01 16:37:26 Um fam, the stocks you're all looking at is not SM ent.  Its a gas company. I thought SM were in US stocks now lol Its supposed to be in Korea so KRW.
1160 2018-10-01 16:37:22 Hey @NRA Trump just said he is very close to eliminating bump stocks. Is this the #potus that takes your guns?
1161 2018-10-01 16:37:17 Bro, you can start with insurance investment that will hold your money but per month forking out is better then non. Even harder to take out. Can try to learn on investment, stocks shares, crypto, forex, trading. Just a 2 cents tips. Good luck!
1162 2018-10-01 16:36:48 Well, they can try to ban bump stocks. Would a ban on something to speed up semiauto fire hold up at SCOTUS?

What about guns with a built in bump stock?

If it's legal, is it permissible to ban semiauto guns which have a rate of fire faster than X?

Slippery slope.
1163 2018-10-01 16:36:40 Hey @DanBidondi @NRA @DLoesch #PreeningCowardDanBongino -- Your guy is eliminating bump stocks.
1164 2018-10-01 16:36:34 @realDonaldTrump your administration drafted three versions of legislation to ban human beings in this country on a swifter timeline than you’ve proposed legislation to ban bump stocks. Don’t give that bs about how long and arduous the legislative process is. 

#VegasStrong
1165 2018-10-01 16:36:16 Everytime I hear you speak I can't believe you sound even dumber than before....an executive order could ban bump stocks, Congress could vote today  to ban bump stocks tou are a liar
1166 2018-10-01 16:35:41 One stupid question about “bump stocks,” which completely ignored root cause
1167 2018-10-01 16:35:39 I watch #legacy #stocks like I watch MMA....I don't care about the fighters, I just want to see some blood and glory
1168 2018-10-01 16:35:03 So there is a statue that says we have bump stocks for “guns”. What???
#LasVegasShooting
1169 2018-10-01 16:35:03 Per trump takes about a year to eliminate bump stocks. But only took a few weeks to "rule out" millions of Muslims from legally immigrating to US.
1170 2018-10-01 16:34:59 President Trump says we are 3 weeks away from bump stocks becoming illegal, during the press conference on the new "NAFT" deal.
1171 2018-10-01 16:34:59 Takes a YEAR to Deregulate bump stocks, but a Week to Deregulate healthcare, Environmental, immigration, financial protections? Really @realDonaldTrump? We're NOT Mar A Lago Members! @MSNBC @CNN @ABC @CBSNews @NBCNews @NewsHour @washingtonpost @nytimes @USATODAY @AP @Reuters @UN
1172 2018-10-01 16:34:56 He flat out lied about bump stocks! He could do it like he did ACA: by Executive Order while working on legislation and he knows that!
1173 2018-10-01 16:34:51 "The bump stock is almost gone," said Pres of the device used by the Las Vegas shooter a year ago, to give some guns rapid-fire capability. In response to a question, @POTUS says the regulatory process takes about a year. Says he's already told the @NRA "bump stocks are gone."
1174 2018-10-01 16:34:49 Trump is “slow walking” bump stocks.
1175 2018-10-01 16:34:44 okay,
in the next 2 or 3 weeks we should see new legislation regarding bump stocks.
The Orange Clown has so decreed.
Let's see if @realDonaldTrump is lying again.
synchronize watches now 3-2-1...
1176 2018-10-01 16:34:29 Does that mean bump stocks have been good for Americans? Clearly not.

1180 2018-10-01 16:33:56 And just now, in *almost* the same breath he said, “what’s happening with Judge Kavanaugh is unjust and unfair” and “banning bump stocks requires some serious policies and procedures. You can’t just rush that.”
1181 2018-10-01 16:33:56 "In a very short time, bump stocks will be ruled out" - President Trump said in a press conference. Earlier today he shared his condolences for the friends and families of victims of last year's Las Vegas shooting
1182 2018-10-01 16:33:55 Trump tells press, “I’ve told the NRA that bump stocks (for guns) are gone.”  First have to change rules, etc.
1183 2018-10-01 16:33:55 Ne demek on annule ma commande psq y’a eu une rupture de stocks??????
1184 2018-10-01 16:33:51 OMG!  This whole thing is just STUPID! He doesn't want to recommend Tobacco stocks! If you don't like that then do your own homework on tobacco stocks and make your own decisions!
@jimcramer is ONE man! Sheesh!
1185 2018-10-01 16:33:51 iirc stocks going up = more ppl want to buy stovks than ppl who want to sell it
1186 2018-10-01 16:33:50 For a man who has signed more executive orders in his first year of presidency, it’s nauseating to watch Donald Trump lie about why we can’t ban Bump Stocks today!

#USMCA #BumpStocks #GunControlNow
1187 2018-10-01 16:33:50 "Statutorily" it takes a year to ban bump stocks. 

But tax cuts? Those only take a couple months. 

Sure, Jan.

1189 2018-10-01 16:33:37 Trump is saying that banning bump stocks takes about a year

Which is no where near the truth
1190 2018-10-01 16:33:35 FYI -  The federal government can ban plastic manufactured bump stocks but it can't ban people using belts, etc to do bump fire.
1191 2018-10-01 16:33:34 annnnnnnd bump stocks are about to be sold out country wide
1192 2018-10-01 16:33:33 Did he just promise to make bump-stocks illegal?
1193 2018-10-01 16:33:31 McColl's on Newbottle Street has a small supply of Houghton Feast 2018 brochures. Grab your free copy while you can. Brochures only available while stocks last - 8,000 copies have literally flown off the shelves!

1195 2018-10-01 16:33:20 I agree. Automatic weapons are banned because they are a military weapon. Thus, bump stocks should also be banned. But I don't agree with you on a handgun ban in Canada. That seems cruel.
1196 2018-10-01 16:33:18 No podés comparar. Estás hablando de la primer revolución industrial previo al uso de máquinas en gran escala. La máquina de vapor aceleró la producción y la acumulación de stocks, la robótica dejo el 90% de desempleo. Que le va a quedar a la gente?
1197 2018-10-01 16:33:12 Trump lying abt bump stocks.   

it's been one year since the Las Vegas massacre. claims his hands are tied.  

GOP Congress could've outlawed bump stocks in 5 days.
1198 2018-10-01 16:32:59 Can’t ban bump stocks because that’s too hard. Banning humans.. no prob.
1199 2018-10-01 16:32:47 President Trump says "bump stocks are gone," in effect. "It's almost gone," he follows up.
1200 2018-10-01 16:32:42 Trump says he's at the final stages of eliminating bump stocks. He explains his imaginary process via which he gets to legislate this.
1201 2018-10-01 16:32:39 Lies about bump stocks now.  
1202 2018-10-01 16:32:36 Oh wow, Bump stocks addressed.
1203 2018-10-01 16:32:31 @realDonaldTrump said that “bump stocks are gone” once the process is complete.  Should be wrapped up soon he says.  #NRA
1204 2018-10-01 16:32:30 On anniversary of Las Vegas shooting, Trump says government is in the “final stages” and the “final two or three weeks" of promulgating a rule on banning bump stocks
1205 2018-10-01 16:32:30 President Trump, asked about progress made on gun violence since Las Vegas concert shooting, says his administration is nearing the end of the process in regulating bumpstocks: "I told the NRA, bump stocks are gone."
1206 2018-10-01 16:32:25 Wow, limiting questions from reporters. @realDonaldTrump is exhausting to listen to. His vocabulary is so limited I get dizzy. FYI, bump stocks are not guns.
1207 2018-10-01 16:32:23 Percentage of NYSE stocks > 200 day 51%. Percentage > 40 day 41%
1208 2018-10-01 16:32:10 Trump lying like a big dog about bump stocks.
1209 2018-10-01 16:32:06 Bump stocks could have been eliminated in a heartbeat...like many other things that Trump has removed.

What a load of shit.
1212 2018-10-01 16:32:04 Lmaooooo he gets pressed on bump stocks and suddenly he's only 2 weeks away from being able to ban them?
1213 2018-10-01 16:31:58 “We’re knocking out bump stocks. I’ve told the NRA bump stocks are gone... two or three weeks. Statutorily it takes about a year to do it.”

1233 2018-10-01 16:22:48 Thats why you dumbbbb. Own stocks for growth and income. (I mean not now becos the stocks are on a rise) Just dont invest in manufacturing and you will be safe.
1234 2018-10-01 16:21:19 In less than two years stocks rise 46 %  because of Trump! Yet Carl the fraud puts his anti Trump biased spin on it.CNBC SUCKS!
1235 2018-10-01 16:19:45 Do you guys pull out of your positions over the weekend, or hodl traditional stocks?
1236 2018-10-01 16:19:15 Nope. The stocks turn up missing because of your choice in where they were left. Same with Heaven or Hell. Your choice. Any guesses on when it's your turn to die? No choice on that. All die sooner or later.
1237 2018-10-01 16:19:02 Big Short guy Mike Burry looks for stocks that trigger initial reaction of “ick!”. Revulsion. That’s where the low hanging fruit is. Same in politics (Cruz and Trump) and media.

1262 2018-10-01 16:11:58 1929 was worse overall with drastic unemployment and so on. But many more individuals were invested in stocks in 00 and 08 and many were deep in QQQ. Just saying I was 30 in 2000 and it was an awful run for a decade but still manage to believe in long term capitalism and stocks
1263 2018-10-01 16:11:49 Opinion...the slightest bear signal for the US stock market could send $BTC to the moon. So while BTC is sitting steady waiting, get your bags filled or empty them out and move on. I can tell you buying into all time highs (stocks) is more risky than buying a consolidated BTC.

1277 2018-10-01 16:08:00 I agree, worse part is that they just want to argue without knowing. We start ABOVE min.wage in the U.S, monthly bonus, stocks 401k, etc. Also, I don't expect to get paid like an executive when I only have a high diploma.  #honestworkhonestpay

1281 2018-10-01 16:07:04 Equities (stocks) have surpassed real estate in the 2Q of 2018 as the biggest source of household wealth for the first time since the 1999 dot com boom- according to Fed data parsed by Steve Blitz, TS Lombard's chief economist- Barron's
1282 2018-10-01 16:06:59 We've nearly regressed to dunking stools, stocks in public squares, and wearing scarlet letters in today's witchhunt mentality.
@realDonaldTrump
1283 2018-10-01 16:06:58 Trump on killing NAFTA / new USMCA.

— On Dems: “They might be willing to throw one of the great deals for people for political purposes. They have 2020 in mind.”

— Stocks opened up on news of deal

— Q for Dems is whether they run to left or middle of this deal.
1284 2018-10-01 16:06:44 The measure app might be the most pointless mandatory app on the iPhone since the news or stocks app.
1285 2018-10-01 16:06:38 I watched the interview. It was strange and insightful. News is arbitrary. Price defines narrative; the narrative does not define the price. The algorithms of these stocks are designed to absorb the variables (buys/sells) whilst adhering to the pattern the algo naturally prints.

And despite the rhetoric after the massacre, there hasn't been anything done to ban bump stocks.

I despise the NRA with all my heart.
1290 2018-10-01 16:05:38 Many bought stocks discounting 2022 earnings. Real visionary stuff. They would surely reach their buy price by 2022 for sure

1334 2018-10-01 15:50:58 seems like there is a lot of political risks in South African stocks to me. Do you think this is overblown?
1335 2018-10-01 15:50:57 I don’t think you can address 1 without the other. The simple fact is the USA will never have no guns. Therefore massacres will happen. The important point is to make it as hard as possible to kill numerous people in a short space of time. Get rid of bump stocks...
1336 2018-10-01 15:50:50 Pot stocks!
1337 2018-10-01 15:50:41 move to ban bump stocks?
1338 2018-10-01 15:50:34 Do you have any good news on any stocks at all or are you simply a broke joke sitting in your mom's basement pretending to look for a job?

1355 2018-10-01 15:47:48 Stocks having a great Monday and hanging out just below the highs of the new range that seems to be forming. TREND UP, NO HEDGES as you would expect from a trend following approach to hedging. Move up the stops and enjoy the ride!
1356 2018-10-01 15:47:47 And don’t forget to sell your pot stocks. Lol!
1357 2018-10-01 15:47:32 But if you aren’t willing to place bets based on these odds, no reason to trade stocks.  Ever.

Is the market trying to tell us something?

Don't lose sight of the main objectives.

1370 2018-10-01 15:44:27 Looking for a re-entry on $TRUL.c. Am I sad I missed the move today? A little. But my goal is consistent profits regardless of the size. Many people can buy stocks but selling is the hard part and that’s my focus right now. All about the process - money follows.
1371 2018-10-01 15:44:27 1 year ago today, the tragic #LasVegasShooting killed 58 people and wounded 489 – making it the deadliest mass shooting in modern history. The @POTUS & the @GOP leadership promised to take swift action to ban bump stocks, but 1 year later – only delays. What happened @HouseGOP?
1372 2018-10-01 15:44:12 One year after Las Vegas mass shooting massacre.  So of course Trump today will be touting how he followed through on his promise to get rid of bump stocks.  Oh, wait.... never mind.
1373 2018-10-01 15:43:44 Well, hyperbole but a lot of people were pretty miserable in 2008 and 2009, got out near the bottom and never got back in. If you're in cash in your 401k, you're probably miserable. If you have been in stocks getting out before the crash and getting in afterwards, you're happy.

1380 2018-10-01 15:41:31 @1a If a finger can naturally recreate the action of a bump stock, then why do bump stocks even exist? This irrational refusal to budge on basic facts is why rational humans are so angry at the NRA.

1383 2018-10-01 15:40:46 2/2 It IS peanuts compared to what corporations got that they used to buy back stocks instead of using to wire more workers to put into wages. 

They gave 1 time bonuses of $1,000 and that was supposed to appease us.

Stock buybacks instead of wage increases. Dem's fault? Nah.
1384 2018-10-01 15:40:16 Yeah, but are you in the 1%? Do you make your living off of stocks? No? Well, enjoy filling out your next tax return
1385 2018-10-01 15:40:09 Jim, You have always insisted your intentions purchasing stocks were never morally or personally biased. To further your agenda, you recommended donating $$ to a better cause with the profits, no matter what the sin stock! That is what I heard U Say _thru _the _years. Why Change?
1386 2018-10-01 15:39:50 @1a They can achieve rates of fire between 400 to 800 rounds per minute depending on the gun. As of 2018, bump fire stocks in the United States may sell for around $100 and up, with prices increasing due to potential regulation. per wikipedia #1A
1387 2018-10-01 15:39:37 Well considering only 54 million Americans have a 401k and 41% of stocks are owned by foreign investors and only 32% of the american work force elect to sign up for work 401K.   Avg 401K has 98,000=8000 per Year in retirement.  Avg health cost in retirment, 275.000 for boomers.
1388 2018-10-01 15:39:31 do you know those debts can be exchanged for $tsla stocks right?
1389 2018-10-01 15:39:01 Agree, but if caq wins I expect theses stocks to follow with a pro oil and gaz gov.
Anyone heard about molson  ready to invest in HEXo?
1390 2018-10-01 15:38:36 For a risk averse new investor !
One should always start from Bluechips either direct (6-8 stocks) or through MFs (2-3 MF). Do a SIP for solid 6-7yrs. More safety less volatility. Post that add 2-3 midcap funds. After a decade, try on small caps wit 1-2% of PF (if reqd) #DIY

1404 2018-10-01 15:35:22 It’s simple. People caught up on the “ban bump stocks” bandwagon need to educate themselves more. You can bump fire with a belt loop, a stick, many different things.
1405 2018-10-01 15:35:16 Biotech stocks are a scam
1406 2018-10-01 15:35:12 SM: *stocks dropping* oh shit it’s time

junmyeon: uh you literally locked—
SM: sshh. you’re coming back so let me prepare a milk bath
1407 2018-10-01 15:35:11 @1A, I would like to hear one good reason why bump stocks and semiautomatic weapons would be necessary for everyday Americans or why they belong anywhere outside of the armed forces of our country.
1408 2018-10-01 15:34:29 This week we’re only focusing on stocks under $1.50!
1409 2018-10-01 15:33:15 Facts don't need to be liked.
White women are laughing stocks to every other race because they've been trained to destroy their own sons, daughters.
WHO is training them?
1410 2018-10-01 15:33:14 Sm's stocks lmao. Thats why you should treat exo well 
1411 2018-10-01 15:32:35 can’t wait for the stocks to update so we can see s* hitting their biggest rate since the beginning of 2018

1416 2018-10-01 15:30:26 $15. New NAFTA, LNG Canada, CBR - sector rotation back into Canada is going to drive heavy oil stocks up.
1417 2018-10-01 15:30:16 Companies buying back their stocks is not a bad thing..
It shows the business has extra money to invest back into itself..
win win
1418 2018-10-01 15:30:13 Everyone wants to "get back to even" when they have a dog in their portfolio. Unless you have a compelling reason to believe that the dog is going to outperform every other possible stock you could buy, you should sell it, and buy one of those other possible stocks. 2/2
1419 2018-10-01 15:30:01 The US-Mexico-Canada-Agreement was created last night and replaces NAFTA. #Stocks are celebrating this morning. #Mortgage Bonds open unchanged as they still battle resistance.
1420 2018-10-01 15:29:11 He's a smart dude. The best stock advice I ever got was "you buy your stocks every day." In other words, assess your portfolio with an eye towards selling stocks that you think will underperform in the future, independent of what you paid for those stocks. 1/
1421 2018-10-01 15:28:49 I don’t think so @xavierpastor. The iconic trend of the increasing percentage of global overfished stocks was presented at least three times. And IUU was discussed at length, including by the Spanish minister of Agriculture at the closing.
1422 2018-10-01 15:28:40 So is a list of my new stocks?
1423 2018-10-01 15:28:18 When @POTUS brags about the economy, he always cites new highs on the #StockMarket.

1) The Stock Market is NOT the economy.
2) Only 54% of Americans own any stocks, bonds or mutual funds.
3) The richest 10% own 84% of all stocks in the U.S.
4) Wages for most workers remain flat.
1424 2018-10-01 15:27:57 Bump stocks are still legal in Nevada, if that isn’t a prime example that Nevada’s elected officials don’t care about their people I don’t know what is!
1425 2018-10-01 15:27:41 Please note:  I said sell some. Not all of it. Why? Sell it all and you just capped your profits.  Let some run as long as possible. #stocks
1426 2018-10-01 15:27:25 Invest in stocks

1430 2018-10-01 15:26:54 “What I think happens is when people buy stocks or any investments, they really focus on the future. When they sell, I think a lot of investors focus on the past.” — Terry Odean (2014), h/t @nikir1
1431 2018-10-01 15:26:51 And so “Don’t Boo”“Hiccup” Heller (R-Adelson) celebrates one year of doing absolutely nothing about assault weapons, bump stocks, background checks for domestic abusers, the mentally ill, even terrorists. America’s most mediocre senator couldn’t act on a fundamental Nevadan issue
1432 2018-10-01 15:26:47 I love checking in on the stock market to see how the stocks my subs bought me are doing. Now be a good bitch and buy me more. My future is important 
1433 2018-10-01 15:26:30 Sorry, the dislocation between EM and DM, the trade war between US and China, the dollar short squeeze and the animal spirit in US stocks. Aren't those the main theme of this year?
1434 2018-10-01 15:26:17 Once white women can be woken up to how they are laughing stocks to every other race because of how they have been trained to destroy their own sons, nephews...they will join the fight.
White women fight for the underdog.
They just don't realize that's white males.

Thank You @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
1441 2018-10-01 15:24:27 SM STOCKS ARE BLESSED
1442 2018-10-01 15:24:04 As am I! Like the majority of Americans, I own no stocks, so the market is not an indicator of wealth for me. Can I afford groceries today, that is my indicator of wealth.
1443 2018-10-01 15:24:01 Be caution !! Correction not over yet...naya trade nahi le...sbhi stocks pr stop loss use kare..market kabhi bhi down side jaa skta hai 500 points tak iss week...
1444 2018-10-01 15:23:52 Bump stocks banned yet? It seems not. Job done NRA.
1445 2018-10-01 15:22:46 NAFTA pact saved at last minute
• Stocks on fire as a result with binds under modest pressure but no new lows
• New move high for oil as Iran again drives prices higher
• NYMEX highest since July 2015
• Tria tries to reassure markets and BTPs do bounce back after poor open
1446 2018-10-01 15:22:33 Just think about how high the indices will be when 95% or more stocks are above the 50 DMA and 200 DMA!  
1447 2018-10-01 15:22:21 Got 2 go Trump speaking about the success of the USMCA and watching my stocks go up Try and have a nice day #keepAmericaGreat
1448 2018-10-01 15:22:06 Arrangements have been made. Stocks are replenished.
1449 2018-10-01 15:21:58 Since Trump's credit card to buy groceries and gas is unlimited (he says); he certainly could not notice little things, like prices gong up.  The stock market being high for so long is a boon only to those who can afford to buy stocks & food.

1456 2018-10-01 15:20:51 Exactly. The business is under pressure and it is a real problem. That’s why market has discounted the valuations. I sincerely think that these stocks are going to take time to reflect their pre stress levels.
1457 2018-10-01 15:20:34 They said no to the legislation because Democrats tacked on all their BS. They have never said no to banning bump stocks. Try again.
1458 2018-10-01 15:20:32 Well not on the overnight delivery so many of our spare parts stores enjoy so making it unnecessary to carry large 'just in case' stocks.

1464 2018-10-01 15:19:24 Start by banning bump stocks.  that si what allowed him to kill/injure so many.  Next is to watch ammo sales and question anyone that buys more than 1000 rounds over three months.  Finally ban ar15-styled weapons.  I would personally like to also see smart triggers mandated.

1478 2018-10-01 15:15:34 $RDGL you had the opportunity to buy at .0026. Now approaching support near .0200 The next opportunity will be more expensive as the steady uptrend continues. All stocks have pull backs on the way up. Opportunity for more strong hands to buy at this level.
1479 2018-10-01 15:15:33 The Justice Department proposed a rule to ban bump stocks and it was sent late last week to the Office of Management and Budget for review. After a review the proposal will be published in the Federal Register, inviting public comment.

1521 2018-10-01 15:03:33 You eliminated personal exemptions so your “doubling” standard deduction is worthless. The only ones “better off now” from #GOPTaxScam are billionaires and CEO’s buying back stocks.
1522 2018-10-01 15:03:29 Jim,  I have had two dear friends die from drug use. The loss is no less horrible than smoking related deaths other than drugs seem take them a lot quicker.

1527 2018-10-01 15:01:39 I don't have a sister.

I miss having someone who hassles me..does opposite of what I say...frustrates me with behavior..changes color from minute to minute..unpredictable with huge mood swings...yet one I can't imagine life without.

Hence I do stocks.
1528 2018-10-01 15:01:37 As for the long-term returns versus stocks, I guess only time will tell. Also I found it interesting that emerging market funds aren't performing as well.

1544 2018-10-01 14:54:17 I guess I should clarify high caps, as in $APPL, $AMZN tickers like that, although $MU is doing well today. They follow support and resistance so much better. You have done well enough in the penny stocks, but I think you would kill these. I won't use the L2 much on these either

1566 2018-10-01 14:46:09 Truth is, stocks, shares, bonds, etc it's all one big gamble, no matter how they dressed it up to make it look "white collar" you're basically gambling your funds to decide whether the value of a company, stock, share, etc goes up or down. That's it.

1572 2018-10-01 14:44:17 Something to consider is the margin requirements on some ETFs being less than the underlying stocks' margin requirements.
1573 2018-10-01 14:43:30 I would go even further and remind you that 15% is 500 basis points above the nominal long-term returns that US stocks have provided in the past and that current valuations are not favorable to expecting a 15% return going forward.

If the CORE portfolio is not of great quality, no amount of buying the same junk generates superior returns over a long period of time.

1770 2018-10-01 13:47:50 Sheik is a whole lot more volatile of the two MUs, but yeah I think Ike has a great enough ability to close out stocks and create pressure that he doesnt have any straight unwinnable MUs. But they are still extremely hard and to win the set you have to really outplay them

1772 2018-10-01 13:47:18 Buying in banking and financials: The banking and financial stocks rallied in today's session after reports emerged that the government is likely to supersede Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) board, and may take a Satyam-like route to deal with the institution.
1773 2018-10-01 13:47:18 And bump stocks are still legal in most states. Ridiculous.

1775 2018-10-01 13:47:01 I know about the Kennedy family. Historians have not found any proof Joseph P was involved in bootlegging.  It was used as a smear campaign against the Kennedys & all Irish to portray them as bootlegging alcoholics. Maria's grandfather made his money in stocks b/f the crash.

1786 2018-10-01 13:43:10 MATH PROBLEM: If the Vegas shooter fired 1100 rounds with bump stocks and killed 58 beautiful lives. That’s an approximate death ratio of 5.3%. How many rounds could he have fired without bump stocks * 5.3% = how many lives could have potentially been saved if they were illegal.
1787 2018-10-01 13:41:27 Only political propaganda

Your incentive to short Tesla stocks means that, soon or later, you will be hit by your political biases

No trade with experience in markets shorts one stock that has so much shorts

It is like putting your money in the Russian Roulette

1820 2018-10-01 13:33:00 4 Fallacies about stocks (Zvi Bodie, JOIM Fall Conf) 
1. Stocks are not risky in the long run
2. Stocks are a good hedge against inflation
3. Dollar-cost averaging improves your risk-reward tradeoff
4. You can identify the best equity managers by looking at their track records
1821 2018-10-01 13:32:58 Nifty will bounce till 11250,
1822 2018-10-01 13:32:53 I love Square but at this price it’s now trading at a forward P/S of 14.6x!!! That’s ridiculous. Comparable high growth stocks trade between 9 - 11x P/S.

1838 2018-10-01 13:28:39 I think it starts today. Just bought some more stocks. 
1839 2018-10-01 13:28:12 Invest in stocks--dividend paying and preferred, bonds, bills and notes, FX,  etc. Do not put them in one basket and in one country. That is diversified portfolio. If you still doubt it, let me manage your fund.

1871 2018-10-01 13:17:25 One year ago in Las Vegas, a man armed with multiple AR-15s equipped with bump stocks shot and killed 58 people and wounded 422 others. 
The Congressional GOP response to this was to protect the NRA
1872 2018-10-01 13:16:42 Basically they gave me when I tried to complain... just suggested I buy a different variant... no offer to replace or refund, I must trust them and buy the crema variant of the same make... except, nobody stocks it!!!
1873 2018-10-01 13:16:39 With summer on our doorstep, we focus on both skin care and body care,
offers as great as these are certainly rare.

1888 2018-10-01 13:12:14 Has anything been done by our government to try and learn from the past and prevent future massacres? Is there at least a ban on bump stocks?
1889 2018-10-01 13:12:07 I looked at my stocks over the weekend and the gains were BOOMING last week. I need to get past this expensive season so I can really invest into more things.
1890 2018-10-01 13:12:06 As an investment writer, I can say that your column on it being time for the dodgers to “panic” was akin to the guy who tells you to sell all your stocks at the market bottom, so you miss the gains.

1902 2018-10-01 13:08:20 4th day in a row where I have over 30 stocks on watch and Tradenet only allows 3 of them and again none of them are halfway decent setups. @meirbarak @TradenetAcademy is this problem going to continue?
1903 2018-10-01 13:07:47 I knew it when I saw auto companies shares getting hit. Now they will rally while the others wait for good news.

The current levels of indices is a bit low. Of course, I don’t have money so I don’t look at these stocks now
1904 2018-10-01 13:06:55 Valuation of bank stocks and nbfc are extremely difficult to find. 
Those are the most common sector which create bull and bear market.
Generally any bank with book value more than 2x is overvalued.
In India you would find mny banks trading at more than 4x book value even today.

"News on stocks is not important. How the stock reacts to it is important."
Michael L. Burke, Investors Intelligence
1999 2018-10-01 12:22:17 Do not leave the chairman's position or president's.

Even if shareholders sell stocks, please apply for budget properly and aim for stable business.

In order to realize the goal, management should be stabilized in a legitimate way and implementation efforts should be continued.
2000 2018-10-01 12:22:12 It’s all so pointless. Requires everyone to learn how to trade stocks to keep up with wealth “creation” transfer. I’m just over here tending bar and bookkeeping.

2036 2018-10-01 12:08:35 One year since one man with an arsenal of rifles and bump stocks slaughtered 58 concertgoers from the window of his Vegas hotel. Pretty much nothing is stopping it from happening again in America.

2042 2018-10-01 12:06:18 Thinking of the Vegas victims, 1 year ago today, more than 800 people were shot by a gunman that had high powered assault rifles and bump stocks, which allowed him to shoot hundreds of rounds of bullets within minutes. #VegasStrong #GunSenseVoter

2070 2018-10-01 11:55:06 All Tesla stocks should fall into strong hands now.
2071 2018-10-01 11:54:36 I bet the bump stocks were a plant.
2072 2018-10-01 11:53:42 They are, but that one part, “sentiment,” is the fickle one that has stocks at historically unsustainable multiples.

Look at the history of stocks advancing and trailing multiples compressing, as we’ve seen this year. Not a pretty picture.
2073 2018-10-01 11:53:22 A year since the deadly shooting in Las Vegas. 
Bump stocks are still legal in 42 states.
Is it too fucking soon now, @realDonaldTrump?
2074 2018-10-01 11:53:14 that will not work very well. it would create super long waiting times for some items. you can buy what is in stock on the platform. stocks are replenished when possible but they are always done at the start of the month or just before it

2281 2018-10-01 09:19:29 Assuming you're comparing 2 stocks with similar yields but one gives annually and the other quarterly, the latter is better. This is because you can reinvest the dividends earlier and your compounded return should be higher.

2294 2018-10-01 09:09:35 The current market offers very attractive opportunities for patient and long term investors. Look for stocks in corporate banks, capital goods, Auto n metals to begin with. In fact many stocks across most sectors are looking very attractive.

2318 2018-10-01 08:54:20 I've spent long time researching stop loses. A fixed % is not great in back-tests, because it does not accomadate for underlying differences in volatility between diff stocks. Something based on vol-adjusted, ATR, or time-based (N-day) works better imv.

2326 2018-10-01 08:45:58 When the waters eventually start to settle on this one, I think we’ll see advisers *generally* identifying as CFM dogmatists and CFM pragmatists.  Neither is more right or wrong.

2328 2018-10-01 08:45:11 And they all put a disclaimer that they don't have any positions or interest on the stocks they recommend... They create interest and they exit
2329 2018-10-01 08:44:55 Markets are probably the best deflator of egos. When stocks did well it’s because of our superior identification skills, but when they do badly we blame bureaucrats, regulators, everyone but ourselves. The dopamine in our own brains stopped us from taking the right actions

2412 2018-10-01 07:26:00 There’s no such thing as a crystal ball for markets, but when most stocks are expensive, the market will deliver mediocre returns at best. By contrast, when prices are reasonable, there’s room for upside surprises. - Francisco García Paramés
2413 2018-10-01 07:25:33 Over inflated stocks may collapse but not inflated egos once they are sky-high.
2414 2018-10-01 07:25:27 Yes we should tax churches for all non-religious activities, such as real-estate holdings, profits on stocks and bonds, commercial profit-making ventures. In other words anything outside the churches strictly religions activitues. And this applies to televangelist in particular.
2415 2018-10-01 07:25:27 Well, to his credit, he wasn't into politics when he first teamed with Adidas to make those. But, Adidas is controlled by its shareholders (stocks, etc.), they dont want the shoes to be made here--less profit. Kanye has less say. But according to Trump, he wants to change things.

2420 2018-10-01 07:21:51 Midcap and small cap stocks specially pharma are heavily underpressure. Please be alert.
2421 2018-10-01 07:20:04 No, the world sympathises with Britain....May & Co are the laughing stocks.
2422 2018-10-01 07:19:56 Investors got to change the mindset of looking to buy into 40-50% stock declines. When stocks in a leading sector fall 30-50% in a month, chances are very high that the sector has made a top and that new highs wont come for many years to come (Eg. Pharma in 2015)

2429 2018-10-01 07:07:45 Interesting stats coming to the fore:

2431 2018-10-01 07:05:53 According to scientific evidence: Being angry over a third person does not help prices of the stocks held in portfolio to go up or recover.
2432 2018-10-01 07:04:21 True, I bought few stocks recently and straight away down to -15% to -20% 
Still 70% in cash but not sure when to check in.
2433 2018-10-01 07:03:40 By having non disclosure clauses industry covers it back . Like in our media I hear the boys rabbiting on about their portfolios and how many properties they own .

2434 2018-10-01 07:01:52 2 points I would like to add.
1. In 2017, our stocks moved 8X to 10X. How about Other country stocks?
2. If those stocks also moved in same way, if our stocks are stumbling, then also two options
   i. Our stocks are in good price to acquire.
   ii. Those stocks may come Down.

2443 2018-10-01 06:55:27 Decline in stocks is not a surprising event. It recurs. If you live in cold climate, you expect freezing temperatures and when it drops below zero you don't think of this as the beginning of the next ice age. You know summer will be warm again. Stocks do the same. ~ Peter Lynch

2476 2018-10-01 06:27:12 Don't you think the panic sell is being orchestrated by some bears who want to gain on the market losses? A serious value investor will stay put, and watch closely now and buy quality stocks. 

Small investors must never try to time the market. Just wait it out.

2508 2018-10-01 05:57:51 The 52 week high is now history. It has no real meaning if a stock soared earlier due to rigging, float mop, side car and fund mopping.

We must take a fresh investment view before we arrive at decisions.
Stocks must be cheap relative to #IntrinsicValue & not their 52 week highs.

2654 2018-10-01 03:59:24 Do you really not think we’re in an asset bubble from @federalreserve policy? They print money out of nothing and wealthy get cheap loans to buy up income producing assets (real estate and stocks), raising the prices. The bubble will burst. Fiat money doesn’t work long-term.
2655 2018-10-01 03:59:07 There's just too many banknote kaya napush up price ng stocks. Their currency is useless would cost you millions to buy say a single tomato :/
2656 2018-10-01 03:58:06 They might have bought such stocks to give exit to some investors.  It needs investigation.

2666 2018-10-01 03:49:20 the Druckenmiller interview on CNBC that's right after is really good too. Druck in 2017 had a great year in stocks but horrible in currencies
2667 2018-10-01 03:48:37 When commodities is launched on #NSE it is natural for money to move out of stocks into commodities. Today's market perhaps reflects this. It is just a market belief with no verifiable data on this.
2668 2018-10-01 03:48:32 Literally all I said was, because it’s a counter, it’s hard to tell exactly where I’d rank it within the top moves. A counter, although this counter can straight up take stocks and win games, can’t shut down any characters and invalidate them like her fair or cloud’s upair do

2671 2018-10-01 03:46:35 sir while we can be reasonably certain that small cap index over the long term will go up but the stocks that form the index will itself be replaced & the risk is that the stocks we hold may be completely wiped off. so many small cap stocks don't survive a decade post euphoria

2795 2018-10-01 02:00:41 No. Social security has been getting gutted for years. Long before Trump. It’s not sustainable. You diversify your 401k so when the market is up (now) you go heavy in stocks then protect profits in bonds and other low risk investments when down.

2828 2018-10-01 01:21:22 So if I am reading this correctly, you risk more on stocks that have more going for them i.e. fundamentals and TA?
2829 2018-10-01 01:21:09 Certainly should not but most of you need a math lesson. High income earners pay in excess of 50%. On top if 45% tax rate, add hst, property tax, gas tax, capital gains etc. Reality is closer to 60% so does anyone wonder why they choose to leave, not to mention Cdn stocks tanked!

2835 2018-10-01 01:14:24 IMO the biggest hurdle is whether you treat all stocks the same or not. Is NVDA the same as CSCO? Certainly not. 

The Van Tharp book talks about R-Values and risking 1% on a trade. Ok, so if you have 10k are you going to only risk $100? IMO you’ll never get anywhere at that rate
