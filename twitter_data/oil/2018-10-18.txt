13 2018-10-18 23:58:57 Having the dollar as the major currency to trade oil is a huge advantage for US it keeps up demand for dollars and helps fed print money to pay for this out of control overspending, take this away chances are dollar drops like a stone,

Prob not.
33 2018-10-18 23:58:29 If you want to study the effect of replacing SFA with n-6 PUFA, you must control for other variables. Red Palm oil is rich in Vit E and SFA. Fatty fish has n-3 and some SFA. Researchers need to setup control and intervention groups such that possible confounders are eliminated.

36 2018-10-18 23:57:35 Thanks bro
37 2018-10-18 23:57:26 the fact that i get to conduct in Lucas Oil Stadium tomorrow give me chills. so many legendary conductors and leaders have performed there and i am so beyond excited
38 2018-10-18 23:57:22 @realDonaldTrump no more foreign oil. US oil only at $25 barrel Bring gasoline  back down to $1.00 gallon
39 2018-10-18 23:57:17 Jamaica just shipped cannabis oil to Canada, no?
So many ways to tap into the industry. 
Don't look at it as a missed opportunity.

44 2018-10-18 23:56:39 Yea those negative rates around the world are really attractive.
45 2018-10-18 23:56:37 Because #feminist ideologues, who advocate standpoint theory, believe they are best equipped to define men according to a framework which paints them as awful by default.

46 2018-10-18 23:56:36 Are they a Canadian oil company now?
47 2018-10-18 23:56:29 Yo USA!  Maybe this a good time to say we don’t need your oil. We can move forward on new energy without Saudi blackmail. Just a thought.
48 2018-10-18 23:56:28 Dear @Walmart - please staff your automotive center according to business needs. I have waited two plus hours for a basic oil change. When I checked in, there were two vehicles in front of me@for an oil change. Was told they never schedule enough staff. #LivingHell
49 2018-10-18 23:56:27 Looks like China is moving away from America with its Crude Oil Purchases.....Canada is increasingly the newest growth source for Crude....Trump’s Trade War seems to be the cause of this change....Trump’s Tariffs will find few winners in America....

55 2018-10-18 23:55:33 Getting tired of this toxic masculinity bullshit. At the end of the day, many men (lo and behold) need to be masculine in order to function in society. A lot of damn contrarians these days who want to be cute by going against the grain for the mere sake of it.
56 2018-10-18 23:55:29 When raising kids, we used to have (frozen) fish sticks w/ corn & rice. 2nite I flashed back with fresh cod & panko crumbs w/light olive oil. Not so greasy, but definitely tasty! {shrugs} Sometimes you like a little comfort food.
57 2018-10-18 23:55:26 Coconut oil. For skin, pulling, and makeup remover.

60 2018-10-18 23:55:13 Becsuse THC does nothing except make you high. It doesn’t control pain, anxiety or anything else better than CBD oil from hemp. Why allow a true narcotic to be used in any sport? It makes no sense whatsoever.

63 2018-10-18 23:55:10 It would be great if you could remove palm oil from your products as well.
64 2018-10-18 23:55:05 I don't think it has anything to do with oil. USA doesn't depend on Saudis like it used to. Plus Trump doesn't give a damn about the USA. My guess is financial ties between Trump and the Saudis.
65 2018-10-18 23:54:54 What is happening now I have never seen in the last 30 years. Not even when Saudis were involved in 9/11 did US media speak out but it is on Khashoggi. Saudis economic situation has also drastically changed and US no longer as dependent on Saudi oil. Produces more than Saudi now.
66 2018-10-18 23:54:45 I cook with extra virgin olive oil, and I don't eat in restaurants anymore. It's tough but doable
67 2018-10-18 23:54:44 The problem is a lot of imbeciles are thinking that the GOI is profiteering, whereas it's the Arabs. Guess they dare protest against the Arabs for high oil prices.

72 2018-10-18 23:54:25 SANA OIL.
73 2018-10-18 23:54:21 The Bushes were very close to the Royal Saudis and the cabinet was deep into oil.
74 2018-10-18 23:54:20 I only seem to get served three types of political ads on digital platforms:
1) Beto O’Rourke fundraising ads
2) Ads for CRTV featuring Alt-Right “Proud Boy” Gavin McInnes
3) Really cringey memes by the Oil industry, about the governor of California

Not sure what that says.

76 2018-10-18 23:54:08 Don't you think the Saudi's will just find some "fall guy" to blame who they'll conveniently behead before he can speak out? Sadly this is what people with ZERO critical thinking skills like Pompeo (unless it profits gov contractors) have come to. Just paid shills. Addicts to oil
77 2018-10-18 23:54:04 half orange n half clove oil in the oil diffuser because now im ready for fall
78 2018-10-18 23:53:58 Nothing gets to me like these @DawnDish commercials of people washing the ducks that have oil on them. Like why yes, I will buy your dish soap because you save the animals thank you
79 2018-10-18 23:53:56 Mughals are of mongol descent, oil comes from middle east, original Arabs consist Christians Jews and Muslims alike, you can't tag oil patent to Muslims.

105 2018-10-18 23:50:58 Made this up as I went. But you use cooked rice chilled. Warm up the griddle, fry rice with sesame oil. Meanwhile cooking veggies on other side. Scramble eggs in middle if griddle. Mix everything together and put lots of soy sauce.

109 2018-10-18 23:50:27 Yeah, oil doesn't come from the dinosaurs. You don't need organic life to form hydrocarbons, the earth produces oil. It's a big ball of lava with a fission star at its core. Boil a bunch of random inorganic stuff and you get oil on top, like a stew. Space rocks are greasy.

116 2018-10-18 23:49:50  that’s when you learn how to change oil. I refuse.
117 2018-10-18 23:49:49 You have some misconceptions about what happened to Alberta's economy. The price of oil did fall, but now has rebounded. We are stuck with one customer that pays nearly $50/brl less the market value. The NDP govt has done a lot to hurt here. Unemployment is 7% Edm & 8% Calgary.
118 2018-10-18 23:49:39 You are *so* out of touch.....Texas is more than just a bunch of oil riggers on horseback toting guns.    Why does GOP have such a hard time reconciling and realizing we are in a new age
119 2018-10-18 23:49:36 Man oil Price's been so missed up for yrs GAS prices or outta the roof ain't no going fix but everyone claims they will!  Say anything for a vote!
120 2018-10-18 23:49:35 He’s your True Liberal defending Trudeau’s attack on the oil industry, ...meanwhile those of us in Ontario who wanted a pipeline to bring us Alberta oil are screwed over and stuck buying Arab Oil imported and shipped on tankers to the port of Montreal.
121 2018-10-18 23:49:28 No it wouldn't, it would mean oil companies have less profits to pay for your corrupt services Lyin' Ted.
122 2018-10-18 23:49:27 Rob not investors confidence remembers oil prices collapsed at the end of a 44 year PC rule who spent every $ in the treasury including the “rainy day fund” #laugheed #heritagefund every dollar was spent poorly with not a single long term investment for the province

125 2018-10-18 23:49:11 @Storm2T You haven’t changed one bit. Saudis can buy arms from Russia, up oil prices, refuse to help against Iran. We would b destroying r own economy. Do business with China who’s human rites r no different
126 2018-10-18 23:49:03 Waiting for my new CBD oil supply from @theCBDistillery is like waiting for Christmas. I am hoping I find some breakthroughs for my son's #ADHD, #Anxiety, and #Autism as well as for my own anxiety. #cbdoil #cbd #autism #ADHD #holistic #holistichealing #mommyblogger

128 2018-10-18 23:48:43 You all are one stroke away from wishing Beto takes this. Big oil or nra wont help just saying.
129 2018-10-18 23:48:37 I'm really sorry, Frey. I dealt with expensive tune ups with my car too awhile ago and my car is leaking oil again after getting checked and tightened. I hope this matter will be handled greatly for you soon.
130 2018-10-18 23:48:20 I don’t have any olive oil... vegetable oil it is.  

Jk...
131 2018-10-18 23:48:09 Theory: it isn’t the smell of popcorn popping per se; not the oil, it is the smell of the heating lamp on the popcorn
132 2018-10-18 23:48:03 Mayo is so easy to make - whole egg, mustard, olive oil (all at room temp). Stick blender - hold over the egg  til emulsified. Add vinegar and flavours. 1 min.
133 2018-10-18 23:47:56 The credit goes to American oil and gas companies finding vast reserves of natural gas.
134 2018-10-18 23:47:54 Can't have any oil or fat to cook your meat. Most of the nuts and seeds they want you to eat take way more than an hour to process. Can't have olives. I'd miss bay leaves. No sardines. I'm beginning to think that they might not have entirely thought this list through.
135 2018-10-18 23:47:38 Tyler Erb or Jason Jameson they both have big wins under there belt this year in world or outlaw and Lucas oil
136 2018-10-18 23:47:37 You ever look at a guy and be like “yeah, he probably quit the oil field and is probably a fork lift operator somewhere”
137 2018-10-18 23:47:33 Because oil is going the way of the dinosaurs. We need cleaner energy. Texas has the capabilities and the location to actually run a decent operation. Keeping Cruz will make sure you're good to go on pollution and waste.

140 2018-10-18 23:47:07 A more than a little snarky considering the statement doesnt match the headline. 
Why she not any other spouses should really do these interviews that only turn out to be fodder for hit pieces. Who cares, shes not elected.
141 2018-10-18 23:46:58 For others reading though: even though its mostly cottonseed oil and T, at least my T uses benzyl benzoate and and benzyl alcohol (as a preservative) both of which are harmful if ingested. I was fine coz it was like one drop but probably don't guzzle down your t.

143 2018-10-18 23:46:34 *crude oil hit its lowest point in Nigerian history, no doubt petrol price will go up.

Yet the man still managed to restore our foreign reserves despite all this
144 2018-10-18 23:46:30 Come to West Texas during the Permian Basin Oil Show. Be lucky to get a room at the Cockroach Inn for $1100/night
145 2018-10-18 23:46:19 I remember the boom years when Alberta was making money hand over fist with oil and refused to share the wealth with the rest of the country. Are you paying sales tax now bys, good on ya!
146 2018-10-18 23:46:18 Remember>> Democrats where the one who fought everything to make America OIL independent, they are NOW pushing to punish the Saudis. This is a Country we depend on to fill our shortage of OIL they will retaliate with high prices on OIL making our GAS and all OIL products SPIKE.
147 2018-10-18 23:46:00 I’ve used both! This one is a spreadable butter that has olive oil in it and it works really well!
148 2018-10-18 23:45:56 The wife and I roast sprouts with sweat potatoes. We drizzle some olive oil and hit them with some garlic pepper. Toss in the oven @ 425 for 20~25 minutes. Game changer
149 2018-10-18 23:45:53 Edibles and oil don't smell much at all...
150 2018-10-18 23:45:38 Everything’s a damn crisis for Dems & to hell with due process for those THEY DONT BELIEVE. Well, here’s one of those allies the Dems harp on Trump about — the one we get our oil from, no less, but the Democrats have already convicted Salman without a shred of real evidence.
151 2018-10-18 23:45:35 I have to get an oil change in the morning and buy this bed set 
152 2018-10-18 23:45:26 No western world will ditch Saudi - KSA spends $100b per year on US defence equipment & supplies billions of $ in oil so it’s all just a smokescreen I’m afraid! Trump + Saud all tight!!!
153 2018-10-18 23:45:21 You say Texas is booming. Where? What is booming? Are you referring to the oil boom that fell on it's face a couple of years ago? Stop lying....oh wait.

155 2018-10-18 23:45:06 A country like Saudi Arabia should be globally sanctioned and not a customer of the US or a supplier of our oil. Our American gas dollars paid for the plane tickets and bone saw used by the Saudi Arabian hit men. Our bombs, dropped by Saudi’s, kill children in Yemen.
156 2018-10-18 23:45:03 Oh sweetie just stop. The internet is laughing at you and you're making it worse. Stop. Delete the tweets, don't insta story nothing, and go back to dipping those fries in the oil. I might be rolling through the drive thru any second
157 2018-10-18 23:44:28 Hahahahahahahahahahahaha
It's oil
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha
Its only about oil
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha
Its all about oil
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha
Its only about oil
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha
Oh sorry its about oil and how much Trump is in debt to the Saudis
158 2018-10-18 23:44:27 Definately a good thing!

Dont care if legal visits are down. Some of them we dont want here either. We DONT NEED TOURISM!
We need to make and sell products! We should be selling enough to make up for any raw materials we need to import. NEED TO WEEN OFF FORIEGN OIL!
159 2018-10-18 23:44:25 He changed my car oil for me and brought me lunch to work 
160 2018-10-18 23:44:16 Can you get truffle oil at a food bank? Apart from Hampstead.
161 2018-10-18 23:44:01 うおおおおおお、げ！！！ん！！！キー！！！！
162 2018-10-18 23:44:00 Up until now, Tommy Ricketts Arena heated resurfacing water to 160F using almost 6,000 litres of heating oil per season. #REALiceCA enables operations to eliminate oil as a heating source. Further savings derive from resetting the brine temperature 3F - 5F warmer. #sustainability
163 2018-10-18 23:43:52 Yes...If the level of your jokes keep going down like this..You may soon find oil.
164 2018-10-18 23:43:42 But that Saudi oil tho
165 2018-10-18 23:43:42 Soak a cotton ball in olive oil and hold over lash they should start to loosely come off
166 2018-10-18 23:43:41 i wonder if this CBD oil is lit probably ISNT tho lol 
167 2018-10-18 23:43:37 Go tell that to the folks that "walked" 1500 miles from Venezuela (socialism) to come to the USA (Capitalism).  Sell your snake oil someplace else snowflake.
168 2018-10-18 23:43:16 Can you imagine kemp as a builder, selling you doors?
Buyer: how good are your doors?
kemp: my competition says air is bad.
Buyer: how much do they cost?
kemp: my competition charges a lot for oil
Buyer: when will you be done?
kemp: my competition did this and that today.
169 2018-10-18 23:43:15 I finally got my bike running on all 4 cylinders anddd I dont even care that one of them is burning oil because I GOT THAT SHIT RUNNING BOIIII
170 2018-10-18 23:43:07 "Humm..." the chef began to think as he poured virgin olive oil onto a pan before adding the chunks of meat to simmer.

"Hard to say but I always wanted to be a chef since I was a child. So, I took courses on my free timee but after my retirement I went full onto my dream"
171 2018-10-18 23:42:56 I had a bath with salts, roses and eucalyptus oil and now I feel better  #selfcare

176 2018-10-18 23:41:48 EPA has repealed specific regs related to mining and oil, their focus is off climate change- removes phrase from their web site. I’m sure you heard trump’s recent comment about climate change. Why are we iut@of Paris Agreement?

181 2018-10-18 23:41:21 How often should I rotate my tires?

Your tires should be rotated every other oil change, (in the very least) some manufacturers recommend a tire rotation every 10000 kilometres. Neglecting to rotate tires is a major cause of premature tire wear.

Kanika.
182 2018-10-18 23:41:18 Maybe that’s the side of your face that you sleep on? I swear by tea tree oil face wash and body wash (Jasön brand), a gentle toner &prescription strength Tretinoin. Or try Cureology &request a formula with Tretinoin.
183 2018-10-18 23:41:18 Rednecks b like “gotta run to the grocery store lemme just roll my trucker cap in some dirt and oil first so everyone there knows I’m outdoorsy”
184 2018-10-18 23:41:13 And then for the industry it will be more expensive to maintain a complex process for producing the several products from extracted oil by reducing the production of one of the most important fraction.
185 2018-10-18 23:41:10 Where did this come from?
I was a heavily addicted smoker, until 2 years ago roughly.

I used medical cannabis, smoke/oil and vape. Not once have a craved tobacco...
186 2018-10-18 23:41:08 Not every country has oil resource income to small population like Norway. Imagine where they’d be without oil.
187 2018-10-18 23:40:56 my motivation is dryin up like the oil reserves the world depends on
188 2018-10-18 23:40:41 You will!! I just have to get an oil change first
189 2018-10-18 23:40:35 あ、猫…！と、遠回りしようぜ？
190 2018-10-18 23:40:31 Keep up with the biotin for at least a full 60 days! Coconut oil and spinach help also. I wish there was something I could do to help you 
191 2018-10-18 23:40:29 It isn't. The first publication mentions wanting to create a blinding effect and thus hardening the corn oil to create fake foods. We know such hardening is often done through partial hydrogenation. The link I shared mentioned this.
192 2018-10-18 23:40:28 I just saw a meme on Instagram about mixing rice with soy sauce and sesame oil and I am dumbfounded because I thought soy sauce rice was something only my mom made
193 2018-10-18 23:40:26 For drying measures, apply nail oil.
194 2018-10-18 23:40:15 Yes yes. Always hated until just roasted in oven with olive oil and salt until the outer wraps are dark brown. Really couldn’t believe they were good, but they are. I bet garlic, Parmesan would be tasty too, but when don’t they?
195 2018-10-18 23:40:13 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。

We sell you weapons, you sell us Oil and you can kill who you want with impunity and we will lie on your behalf?

203 2018-10-18 23:39:03 Friend: why do you use beard oil?

Me: because I like to be able to smell my own face
204 2018-10-18 23:39:02 Trump is the worst puppet of all time. Restoring American power and prosperity, giving offensive weapons to Ukraine, bombing Russians in Syria, Pleading with EU/Germany not to buy oil from Russia. The list goes on.
205 2018-10-18 23:38:49 We NEED a president and people in   the government that is highly against the oil and gas industry we need to make the switch to renewable energy ASAP because the  consequences is already started to unfold if we don't do anything these consequences will have worst effects.
206 2018-10-18 23:38:39 Don't blame trump now cz america doesn't like to exploit its oil deposits they prefer to deplete the resources of the middle east well ....so trump is just going along with the system
207 2018-10-18 23:38:36 when democrat voices are amplified, so are the war machine, oil & gas industry, the banks, the police state, militarized police, colonization of domestic & international communities, genocide, prison slavery, corporate capitalism, criminalization of the poor
208 2018-10-18 23:38:25 I mean, I do oil paintings too. I learned out of spite when assholes tried to say I wasn't a "real" artist. Surprisingly, a lot of my clientele are uh.. They're pretty varied.

212 2018-10-18 23:38:15 Salmon seasoned with ole Bay, pan fried in olive oil/butter along with mushrooms and chopped garlic.
213 2018-10-18 23:38:07 We estimated that about 10,000 orangutans on Borneo currently occur in areas allocated to oil palm. I would suggest not to rescue them but instead fight for protection of these areas.
214 2018-10-18 23:38:05 Precipitous drop in sea ice in Arctic means there is oil and gas research, loud seismic airguns,  and will be commercial shipping through northern sea route past Russia. Sound makes it harder for bowheads to hear each other

224 2018-10-18 23:37:08 Well there is having the largest oil deposits in the world may he but you don't touch ..like america itself just moving around the middle east snooping around for deposits to deplete
225 2018-10-18 23:37:06 I know what is involved with training. The collapse of that was due to clever folks figuring out how to extract shale oil/gas. That US production killed the price of oil. Apprentices get screwed. Been there. Companies cut the wages because they can. They don't care for you.

231 2018-10-18 23:36:35 As a professional team one who is only based in the north east, who has had plenty success not only domestic but European. In an area rich by oil and other natural resources, yes I think they should be bigger
232 2018-10-18 23:36:35 It’s such a weird attitude this govt has. The world over, govt do all they can to entice major oil companies to prospect. NZ says no we like being poor.

235 2018-10-18 23:36:22 There are literally billions of people employed in some facet of the oil energy. Billions. THIS WILL NOT CHANGE OVER NIGHT. Yes renewable energy is coming but it is not ready to sustain a global economy, and oil will be needed for decades to come.
236 2018-10-18 23:36:17 What ... how'd you go from ... nevermind. If you want your life run by big pharma, big oil, & corporations; then you keep voting for the GOP.

237 2018-10-18 23:36:14 Oil and water are incompatible, until you add something to them, anyone who has ever baked a cake can tell you as much. Add love and respect to Christianity, and it and the LGBT community are again compatible. Perhaps he's just missing part of the recipe.

249 2018-10-18 23:34:53 I soak mine in coconut or moroccan oil once a week and it’s so good. Just put it all over for about an hour then wash your hair like you normally do!
250 2018-10-18 23:34:43 I love how coconut oil is in nowadays and is being infused in shampoos. Us desi girls would be made fun of for smelling “bad” if we put coconut oil in our hair.

253 2018-10-18 23:34:24 Moody's: New Mexican president will restrict Mexican oil to domestic refining only. Meaning no exports. With Venezuela a basket case, and Mexican heavy crude exports curtailed, this means an even bigger demand for Canadian heavy crude in U.S. Another opportunity passing us by.

260 2018-10-18 23:33:36 That's not true...

15 to 25 years left...

Unless they find more oil..

The Saudis don't want you to know that.
261 2018-10-18 23:33:35 You have your Presidents mixed up! Under BO the only jobs we could get were service jobs as in "low paying" (to quote YOU) restaurants or hospitals, nursing homes! With Trumps deregulation good paying blue color jobs are again opened up, manufacturing, fracking, coal, oil ects!
262 2018-10-18 23:33:31 mom gave me “chill out” essential oil. i hope she doesn’t actually think it’s gonna make me stop stressing about everything

313 2018-10-18 23:28:27 Instead of being fearful of Middle East oil cartels cutting off oil when we defend our values we should use our Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to our advantage. Stop buying Saudi oil for two weeks see how they like it.
314 2018-10-18 23:28:24 No it’s not. Oil and gas exploration in Colorado has only grown the last 10-15 years. The affects of climate change have been occurring much longer. You’re confusing the two.

318 2018-10-18 23:28:05 I doubt that very much. Our relationship with SA is delicate as POTUS is working to get them to step up in the Syrian battle field w/money & troops.Also, he wants them to produce more oil to take up the slack created by the sanctions on Iran.They have power w/1/3 of worlds oil.

388 2018-10-18 23:23:06 I just tried to find that post and he edited that image out. What a weird post though. Did you know oil companies never covered up research or made misleading claims because they aren't good at covering their tracks?

At least he seems to relate fire to climate change now. Wow.

405 2018-10-18 23:21:55 Best results, you gotta know your exact hair type(porosity) but generally a weekly jojoba oil pre shampoo treatment for 20 minutes -an hour or more will do great and a deep conditioner (as a mask or a DIY) is a must. Don’t over shampoo your hair, once/twice per week at most

430 2018-10-18 23:19:29 Sure. BUT! It's not that much different than Venezuelans crude is it?  They already have two coasts open to them.  They depended on oil to much though.  That's where their hyperinflation comes from.

440 2018-10-18 23:18:57 You're seeing it play out now.

MBS diversifying/spazzing out  means less pressure on Iran which means China gets non-petrodollar oil... which means they play nice in the trade war.

But praetorians play hard and won't stop at splitting hairs on the issue. Incirlik is a conduit.

453 2018-10-18 23:18:12 We have some conventional oil still but not much and another big problem is the low price of natural gas. Most people forget Klein paid the debt on record high natgas prices not oil.
454 2018-10-18 23:17:59 Curious how Trump haters would like to handle w/o all the facts yet? Should we NOT sell arms to SA and allow China to have the upper hand? Not take Saudi oil & frack here in the US? If Prince MbS was involved, then work w/ King Salman and have him appt new successor.
455 2018-10-18 23:17:58 That $100B loss of arms sales would be offset by NOT buying oil from them. #FrackNation

505 2018-10-18 23:15:24 The Irish have solved their own fuel problems. 

They imported 50 million tons of sand from the Arabs and they're going to drill for their own oil.

507 2018-10-18 23:15:21 Whatever you do, do NOT try castor oil. I did that and it was the worst decision of my life.

511 2018-10-18 23:15:05 "Oil" is the favorite word of people building online dating profiles in the U.S. states of Texas, Oklahoma, and North Dakota.
512 2018-10-18 23:14:45 But Oil.  Wasn't that our rationale in the 1950s when we propped up the Shah and undermined free elections in the Middle East? It worked so well then too! I'm sure Saudi's won't hate us for supporting their oppressive leadership either.
513 2018-10-18 23:14:35 Oh there is so much that can help! Vitamin C, rosehip oil...I have to link you to a group that helped me. It’s on Facebook
514 2018-10-18 23:14:27 I bought that foot grater looking shandis from clicks and a Black charcoal looking pumice stone. I grate then follow with the pumice, moisturise (I over do everything so cream, Vaseline and baby oil is what I use on my body) and socks. But that's only cause I've got fake OCD 
515 2018-10-18 23:14:16 I just showed my son how to add oil to my car.
516 2018-10-18 23:14:14 I have Peter the most beautiful oil on canvas by a woman in her 90’s you would love it to bits and pieces x

518 2018-10-18 23:13:59 ‘tis the season for fleece lined clothing & oil baths.
519 2018-10-18 23:13:56 Lmao I’ll probably take it somewhere cheap for the oil change my dealership up charges so much. Hopefully when I turn the car in within a few months they won’t be too pissed thank you!
520 2018-10-18 23:13:56 Oil of clove is an aphrodisiac. Drop a couple drips of that into a diffuser and be great with your spouse.
521 2018-10-18 23:13:53 Daal: cook finely diced onions & tomatoes in a pot with oil, turmeric, garlic, garam masala, coriander, salt, cumin, & curry powder. Add some water and cook down into a sauce. Mix sauce with cooked lentils and serve topped with olive oil. Eat it with yogurt and naan. The best.
522 2018-10-18 23:13:44 Two novel ideas:

Do you think money is free speech. Do you think political contributions from oil companies, Koch Bros, pharmaceutical companies, insurance companies, etc help us?

And I happened to say to the Rupert there's a cheese shop here
Yes he said, the finest cheese shop in all of England
And I said 
This whole area of London owned by the Norwegian Oil Fund

535 2018-10-18 23:12:17 Development of the oil and gas industry in the US happened as oil from right and bowhead whales was dwindling because they were nearly extinct

538 2018-10-18 23:12:01 That is why Trump put a former lobbyist who protected the gas and oil industry to be the Director of the EPA. The new director is abolishing science in the EPA policy.
539 2018-10-18 23:11:41 The bread, but Imake 'em with olive oil sometimes and put the oil in the pan.
540 2018-10-18 23:11:38 Absolute nonsense.  Norway is a vastly different country to Scotland.  SNP suggested significant annual surplus and had oil as one of the major pillars of that.  Was proven to be false pricing.  A verifiable fact you don’t like
541 2018-10-18 23:11:33 I literally use a basic neutrogena for my face wash lol but ive also added witch hazel as my toner and then my moisturizer is aloe Vera gel mixed with vitamin E oil and that’s been working well for me 
542 2018-10-18 23:11:23 New brakes, tires, and an oil change in less than a week. I’m not mad at the timing bc driving my car is going to feel extra nice.
543 2018-10-18 23:11:08 I usually change my own oil, but I'm missing two tools that I experienced.

556 2018-10-18 23:10:16 Perhaps Trump is trying to protect the economy from $100.00 dollar or higher a barrel oil. If Saudi’s shut the tap off it’s the 1970’s all over again. I lived thru that shit and I don’t want to again. Know the death is evil event but life of one over the greater whole is issue.

560 2018-10-18 23:09:45 Absolutely correct. Don’t forget that the W Harding another Republican set the gold standard when it came to corruption not only in the WH but gov’s itself. Remember the Teapot Dime scandal w the Navy’s Oil reserve? Read the book & C that Trump wants to exceeded.

570 2018-10-18 23:08:40 #bbcqt asked what we should do against the Saudi Government, in light of the alleged murder of the journalist #Khashoggi? Suggest we work hard to create a universal alternative to oil. Once we have perfected it we can send the Saudi’s back to the dark ages where they belong
571 2018-10-18 23:08:32 Probably. I was looking up how much there province is selling oil for and almost everything in the website was already sold out.
572 2018-10-18 23:08:27 A heartbreak hurts and all, but have ya'll ever fried food and the oil jumps onto your skin...now that's pain.

They have motive (he accused them of buying stolen Syrian Oil from ISIS), They've motive to hurt the Saudi Regime & US alliance.They had opportunity and a past history of disappearing ppl.
575 2018-10-18 23:08:03 Now what if you tried to cover oil changes through your car insurance... all that paperwork handled by insurance would turn a $40 oil change into a $600 fiasco. Now add Medicare and Medicaide bureaucracies and you start to understand why health care is so expensive.
576 2018-10-18 23:08:02 Exactly. We’re done with these wars for oil

579 2018-10-18 23:07:13 The ones pushing misleading narratives the hardest is this party. Alberta's problems stem from 1 thing and 1 thing only. Low oil prices. No party can fix that. I'm not committed to any one party but the UCP leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Petty, ignorant & misleading.
580 2018-10-18 23:07:12 What did North Sea Oil rev give you?

Norway: We have $1 trillion fund and we own 1.4% of global stocks. 

UK: We have nada.
581 2018-10-18 23:07:10 Yes, I think there's a limit to how much consumer behavior can change the industry. Particularly because a substantial amount of the demand for palm oil comes from countries like Indonesia and India, where many people can't afford to be choosy about their consumption
582 2018-10-18 23:07:09 Social Security has dedicated funding sources from withholding taxes and its Trust— it’s not debt financed. If you want to talk about borrowing money to secure oil shipping lanes with our navy I’ll listen.
583 2018-10-18 23:07:03 What did North Sea Oil rev give you?

597 2018-10-18 23:06:06 Lovely. Mine is a large puddle of olive oil in the bottom of the wooden bowl, 4-6 crushed garlic cloves, large spoonful of Dijon mustard, a couple shakes of crazy Jane’s mixed up salt, generous dashes of red wine vinegar and a squeeze of a slice of lemon.
598 2018-10-18 23:06:01 Scandinavia countries fund their socialist programs from all the oil they get from their North Sea oil platforms. What happens when those dry up?
599 2018-10-18 23:05:45 Todah very much  I accept with gratitude & pray the Lord that He will pour His oil on you too & always bless you & your household in precious name of our Savior & Messiah Yeshua!

601 2018-10-18 23:05:37 Let's. Same as Norway but replace oil with "won the cod wars". It has a population the size of Coventry, over half of whom believe in fairies. Recently a road wasn't built because it would destroy their habitat.
602 2018-10-18 23:05:32 Getting an oil change done on my car so I may be late for the stream tonight I’ll let everyone know when it’s going to start
603 2018-10-18 23:05:23 The good old days! And when the oil runs out, they'll go back to steam power!
604 2018-10-18 23:05:21 Historically, US being allied with SA was because they controlled worlds oil once upon a time.
Gave birth to Osama bin Laden who hated US bases on SA soil.
Thru SA became a way Arab nations could possibly make peace w/Israel, a big US interest
605 2018-10-18 23:05:20 It's a buyer's market!

This situation was Created for the purpose!

Saudi Arabia can go to Russia and China for NUKEs!!!!! Change from Petro Dollars to Remembi/Rubels for oil barrels!

It's a false flag!!!!

609 2018-10-18 23:04:58 Tell your son-in-law Kushner that this will NOT BLOW OVER.  We don't need the Saudis, they need us.  We can produce our own oil now and we don't need to kiss these butcher's asses anymore.  Shameful how you are connect at the hip with these animals for the almighty dollar.

[13] Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms. [14] Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:
612 2018-10-18 23:04:30 Add coconut oil or olive oil next time and a few essential oils !
613 2018-10-18 23:04:24 Oil fragrance keeping me calm. Eucalyptus and citrus. 
614 2018-10-18 23:04:20 I have this issue too, coffee drinkers tend to stay more dehydrated so try to drink extra water. Try jojoba oil. It’s really good for anti-aging as well and you can massage it onto your face/neck at night and sleep in it for extra moisture.

618 2018-10-18 23:03:19 Australia needs to crank – up local production of hydrogen fuel, to enable hydrogen fuelled cars and avoid importing Saudi oil.

620 2018-10-18 23:02:59 I had a good friend long ago, an engineer and geologist who was married and had a kid, worked as a geophysicicist for an oil company in Houston. Quit his job, moved back to Alabama and wrote a fiction novel about cats. Lead character was "Mr. Bowtie," a cat with a spot on neck.

627 2018-10-18 23:02:28 PERSONAL COMMITMENT?!?  how much is that in Oil?
628 2018-10-18 23:02:27 Oil was down below $US80 a barrel (brent crude) as inventories are showing greater supply. Chinese stocks tanked again yesterday and are trading at their lowest level since 2014. 
The #ASX is opening lower
629 2018-10-18 23:02:25 Now that the season is going and Oil have access to the LTIR relief, so there's nothing stopping Chia from sending Garrison down and bringing Gravel up
630 2018-10-18 23:02:08 Ameen
631 2018-10-18 23:02:07 Just don’t buy their oil. Venezuela has more than enough to supply the US. Top Trump.
632 2018-10-18 23:02:01 Ryan, for most of us, saying that the US is the largest producer of oil and gas on the face of the planet is like saying that we were the largest producer of buggy whips the day before Henry Ford announced the opening of his assembly line in 1903. We’re way past that. Grow up.

635 2018-10-18 23:01:40 Alleged.  Alleged.  Surely a snake oil rep would not embellish the truth to impress another coach on a phone call.

637 2018-10-18 23:01:37 I come from a big family, so we lived in a large farm house.  I remember always being cold in the winter during those years as my father tried to heat the place with a wood stove because we couldn't afford the oil for the furnace.
638 2018-10-18 23:01:37 Wait for Saudis probe. It will drop more and OiL prices will go up up up
639 2018-10-18 23:01:35 Ive been using coconut oil but it hasn’t been doing shit for me, now I’m mixing honey and coconut oil and my lips still be dryyyy, they are perpetually chapped.
640 2018-10-18 23:01:20 I had one like that. You are just waiting aren't you......hope you get some sleep. Try some olbas oil and/or steam in her room. Worked for us. Also turned out child was asthmatic and over produced mucus.

Here are some facts about Bergamot Oil...
1. It’s a neuro-tonic that has the ability to fight depression and fatigue.
2. It’s a powerful anti-aging lotion. 
3. Therapeutic properties include antispasmodic, analgesic, and antibiotic.
642 2018-10-18 23:00:53 As long as they've got trillions dollars of oil that the West needs, I think they could execute 50 journalists on the White House lawn and we'd find a way to excuse their behaviour
643 2018-10-18 23:00:49 3- of it into a similar chaos as that in Lybia They surely would have occupied the Oil fields as they do now & left Damascus in pieces after a bombing campaign against the "former moderates" that would by then be labeled radicals & they would have shared some of the land

650 2018-10-18 23:00:18 I need to go buy a pen and some oil I need the watermelon flavor 
651 2018-10-18 23:00:17 Wow ! That was really  at the top of my agenda !! NOT ! Can we do other things that are way more important please like say illegal immigration, oil industry , job creation , tax breaks for working class citizens just to name a few !!
652 2018-10-18 23:00:02 The #Saudis are no better than Iran but #Republicans love their money and their oil so they look the other way when their true colors are shown. It's all about money.

658 2018-10-18 22:59:10 We need their oil and as a bulwark against Iran, therefore, nothing will change. Sorry, just reality.
659 2018-10-18 22:59:00 This is like the first time since 2013 my due date for an oil change came up before I went over the mileage
660 2018-10-18 22:58:56 + privacy, -bias, governance, diversity esp. gender in this context - neutral vs. engendered vs. perceived. At times I think we could do worse than an entry for AI - whole lotta snake oil out there...!
661 2018-10-18 22:58:46 Which is all well and good and obviously consumers need to show we support sustain palm oil but when plantations are being put up sneakily inside rainforest patches, there's a problem from the roots up.
662 2018-10-18 22:58:45 After applying coconut oil to my hair for a few nights it’s so silky and healthy 
663 2018-10-18 22:58:39 Must be desperate, I'm no oil painting. (Fortunately there are plenty of other people on the train, and it's a through train, no separate carriages).

665 2018-10-18 22:58:37 Going back to 1973... Circled the oil crisis!
666 2018-10-18 22:58:36 I lost it last night in the parking lot in front of a coffee shop; it fell off of me and subsequently out of my car when I stepped out
it was in my lap bc I use it to dab sweat and oil from my face
(I used to hoard napkins for this purpose which is why she got me these)
667 2018-10-18 22:58:33 I could be wrong but I thought it was mid early 60’s before oil was explored in SA commercially. Remember seeing a poster of Phillips 66 there just starting work.
668 2018-10-18 22:58:22 When food corporations say they're committed to sustainable palm oil, does that mean anything? Should I avoid products that contain palm oil when possible?

671 2018-10-18 22:58:15 They have been butchering people for years.  They stone people in the street.  They are barbaric.  We need their oil and we have been allied with them since 1933.
672 2018-10-18 22:58:14 I’m trying. I’m giving them a break rn. I put coconut oil all over them trying to get the lashes to come off but it didn’t work very well. I’m scared I’m gonna have bald eyelids by the time it’s over.
673 2018-10-18 22:58:00 Has anyone successfully used reusable eye makeup remover pads with micellar water (coconut oil is a no no for me) and not had to scrub their eye raw or had the pad soak up all the product that it used half a bottle of make up remover?

We just want service A done, and engine oil change for AMG shouldnt be dragged on for so long. We’ve had better service at Honda!
681 2018-10-18 22:57:04 We are still involved in Iraq and Afghanistan. We are attempting to destabilize Iran (a place that SA and Israel push us to stay in constant conflict with). I did not say get off oil. I said reduce our reliance. A green new deal is a start.  Not throwing out fuel standards also.
682 2018-10-18 22:57:02 Looks fabulous and sound's amazing
683 2018-10-18 22:57:00 Making sense now.  Libya, Iran and Iraq also have substantial oil reserves.

719 2018-10-18 22:51:20 Mine as well; my 1st thought (after horror) was - oh, it's a test. Which DJT will "pass" by Saudi standards in that he will choose $, guns, oil, & whatever the prize is at the end of his presidency.

722 2018-10-18 22:51:16 Yes less wars is good, we haven't got into any new ones so that's a plus. But the only way we can get off oil is if a cost effective energy source is somehow found. The only way that new source is wifely adopted is if it's cheaper than oil, It's just economics.
723 2018-10-18 22:51:13 Girl if you don’t decarb some nug and infuse that into some coconut oil then rub it on your lower tummy and lower back.

769 2018-10-18 22:46:55 After decades of ruining economies by raising oil prices, funding the spread of radical islam, and something that happened on Sept 11, 2001, NOW the media cares about the Saudis?  What about Vince Foster? (lol)
770 2018-10-18 22:46:42 my doctor just prescribed me zolmitriptan. if that doesnt work im chugging cbd oil
771 2018-10-18 22:46:41 That guy is so typical of the whining AB con. Look at his TL he has a major hate on for Canada coast to coast. Has no idea what equalization is or how it works, he thinks Trudeau personally imports SA oil just to cut AB's oil out, man's an asshat
772 2018-10-18 22:46:10 Very good. Here`s One: OPEC has suddenly decided to lower the price of crude -- Mr. Trump`s payment for plausible cover-story. Just what he arranged with Turkey is about to unfold -- but watch the price of oil, that`ll tell you if Prince Bonesaw is pumping like crazy.
773 2018-10-18 22:45:51 Why you drink dirty oil anaaaa?
774 2018-10-18 22:45:41 We should start a strategic disengagement from Saudi Arabia and not stop until the USA has as little involvement with them as possible. I don't want to be dependent on oil anyway. #tytlive

778 2018-10-18 22:45:17 Also, oil companies are making civil discourse and democracy more difficult, by poisoning everything, including universities, that their profiteering touches.
779 2018-10-18 22:44:56 The guy told me my car takes a different kind of oil n therefore charged me $97 lmao
780 2018-10-18 22:44:53 Mom- “give the girls some money so they can buy oil.”
Dad- “Oh, well i got some oil in my barn.” 
Mom- “You got some oil on your face too, but that still isn’t gonna help me cook these potatoes.”
Dad- “Wow, that was a good one.” 
781 2018-10-18 22:44:44 Getting my oil changed and tires rotated is so annoying, yet very necessary. I need an assistant.
782 2018-10-18 22:44:42 Cause Mexico got no oil
783 2018-10-18 22:44:41 Why oil gotta be so damn expensive
784 2018-10-18 22:44:33 Anybody any clearer now why floatation of Saudi national oil co got pulled? (Probably on Wall St, not any other stock exchange.)

787 2018-10-18 22:44:06 As do most hard-core #Democrats. Truth and Democrats are like oil and water. They just don’t mix!
788 2018-10-18 22:44:02 Oil prices went down Norway netted $1.49B,so it is nothing to do with oil prices it is the people who controls the management of the energy sector!!!
789 2018-10-18 22:44:01 Starting to rethink that whole going to school thing. Oil field operators I work with 65/75 dollars an hour.
790 2018-10-18 22:44:00 Why is Trump’s administration covering for the Saudis? 

Oil  
Arms manufacturing  

The corporate corruption of our politics has corrupt our country’s morals. Time for change.
791 2018-10-18 22:43:49 Thanks. We spoke about the potential yesterday and have a Town Hall on Nov 1. But Ja can't export ganja. Would to have to be the oil I understand

797 2018-10-18 22:43:11 My name is Stanley Ke and have come to ask for an interview on cars. I must do an independent study project for my class. I was looking for an expert in cars since I am doing my project on Electric cars vs. Oil drilling companies. I would appreciate it if I could ask you a few Qs
798 2018-10-18 22:43:09 Yea, I know how to check all my fluids and I can even put on my own brakes. It wasn't until I got a car that oil changes cost $100 that I wanted to learn to do it myself
799 2018-10-18 22:43:05 Murder of Khashoggi is a horrific act done by Saudi Arabia, which is only distinguishable from the terrorist group ISIS because it's a country with a lot of oil. Otherwise they both hold no value for life or humanity. We should do NO business with them.

801 2018-10-18 22:42:58 But seriously- anything overt pretty much guarantees bad things for Israel and for the petro dollar. I don’t want to see a word where oil is sold in euros, yen, or rubles- do you?
802 2018-10-18 22:42:54 ???Your hero is a man who signed the NDAA, punished whistleblowers, expanded Bush foreign policy initiatives gave Wall street banks a pass for robbing the American people on top of the minor slap on the wrist to BP oil for its crimes against the environment...wow...what a hero...
803 2018-10-18 22:42:52 As Trump wanders the country like a homeless drifter, giving incoherent snake oil sales pitches to the suckers still willing to show up to his rallies, there’s virtually no one left running his illegitimate White House, thank God the least amount of those inept fools the better
804 2018-10-18 22:42:46 What do you care you’ve already took all you need out of AB oil , go away and retire in the Bahamas with you other oil executives

811 2018-10-18 22:42:11 Yemen is a very rich and natural resources And of course oil.
812 2018-10-18 22:42:03 They got oil too. But they are modernizing day by day. As women driving ia allowed also there. But the politicians are spreading hate between both countries public
813 2018-10-18 22:41:59 Not to mention, how crazy the oil prices will reach.
814 2018-10-18 22:41:38 If Florida does not claim the oil China-Russia-Cuba will join forces and seize it
815 2018-10-18 22:41:00 What magic hat do you think your little king kenney . Can he raise the price of our oil NO , with massive cuts come massive layoffs which in turn causes huge tax losses . Deregulation just means more polluting, the farmers in Sask. are already calling foul on these companies

UK foreign policy on  is a joke

Gov take the morale high ground & say we are no longer selling you arms & forget about laundering money and buying homes in Mayfair.

Reality is, don't piss them off as they will jack up oil prices and start trading with China.

823 2018-10-18 22:39:54 what the Saudi golden boy has for Khashoggi, sanctions would already be tightened. Maybe all it takes to have the US and EU powers turn a blind eye on such horrors are arms and oil deals with the world sponsor or religious extremism?

829 2018-10-18 22:39:05 IT HAS TO DO WITH OIL AND OIL COMPANIES.
830 2018-10-18 22:39:04 Are you the dying thief? Has your accountability evaporated? Are the teachings on separation & sanctification a waste of biblical paper? Who are the biblical warnings to? Why did Christ reference 3x names being blotted out of book of life? Buy oil dear friend and read all the KJV
831 2018-10-18 22:39:02 how often do you guys apply black castor oil to your scalp?
832 2018-10-18 22:38:50 Yoruba soups. tomato, pepper and palm oil.and any green leaf.  Made me gain weight 
833 2018-10-18 22:38:49 Agree. But until the worlds addiction to oil is eliminated, nothing will happen. Go Elon.

835 2018-10-18 22:38:38 Will be interested to see how many new oil rigs online Friday.  Few Nat Gas came back online last week too. (To be fair)

838 2018-10-18 22:38:17 And CBD oil to sleep.
839 2018-10-18 22:38:03 None of those methods, solar, wind, make a dent in what we use. Whereas oil is cheaper than milk or even bottles water.
Lastly Mormons have their own issues with Trump that you missed, Flake, Romney, all feel free to rip on @realDonaldTrump, makes them bad subjects for study.
840 2018-10-18 22:37:39 Come on to fuck as a scot all my life now 51yrs England and Thatcher and also Labour have let me down on many things you look west from st Andrews Donald dewer sold our water oil so we could have a parliament but with no control ??

843 2018-10-18 22:37:29 I disagree that large corporations are able to change without an outside threat to every employee’s job at once. The only way to make such a threat is by disbanding one oil company as an example of what will happen to the rest, unless they change.
844 2018-10-18 22:37:10 Who is afraid to try CBD oil because they don't know enough about it?

862 2018-10-18 22:35:04 Hopefully they will make it permanent hike na, no matter what the oil price is the fare hike should remind ag is at P 10.00 only.
863 2018-10-18 22:35:04 The way they write "when oil became a VERY strategic resource" as some declaration of profundity and not a Statement of the Bloody Obvious

865 2018-10-18 22:34:46 An editor asked me today whether non-American readers would understand "sabermetrics." I said yes. But I have never heard anyone say "add oil."

Little: Or Palestine. Or Maraca.
Me: Perhaps
Little: We can have an olive tree and I'll pick the fruit into a basket and put it into an oil product
Me: Go on
Little: then you can make a fancy salad
Me: sounds like a plan
868 2018-10-18 22:34:31 My best friend did and she said it cleared it up on the first use! It does turn everything purple though so she recommended putting coconut oil on baby's face before using it and then use baby wipes immediately after it helps a lot but it's still a lil purple for like 2 days!
869 2018-10-18 22:34:17 Awww well thats okay, i’ll atleast know to get peppermint oil!
870 2018-10-18 22:34:11 lol at these snowflakes wanting clean water.  Drink some oil bitches.
871 2018-10-18 22:34:08 Everyone knows we depend on foreign oil so what is really going on behind the scene, this is nothing new for Arabia 
872 2018-10-18 22:34:06 I would prefer it too. Even if it meant losing an Industry worth £6.6billion. It’s enormous and sadly very important to our coffers hence the hesitation of our politicians here & abroad. As the Oil crisis is the 70s proved, they are extremely powerful due to their reserves.
873 2018-10-18 22:34:06 Matatapos ko kaya oil pastel ko mamaya lel
874 2018-10-18 22:33:58 I agree that oil company employees have lots of good stuff. I disagree that pipelines and refineries can be salvaged. IMO, the value of oil companies, including all their sunk assets, is scary negative. They are villains, like hitler, because they lie, cheat, and steal our future
875 2018-10-18 22:33:40 Stupid idiots were hosting Davos on Desert and the invitees ran away saying "oh my look Devils on Desert, get the hell outta there." They had been killing the Caliphs n grandsons of the Prophet Mohamed(sws) not so long ago. God's curse on them, gave oil  but didn't give brain.

877 2018-10-18 22:33:30 would you recommend introducing an oil cleanser into a skincare routine first, or could i bring in a foam cleanser at the same time? heard conflicting things on this topic
878 2018-10-18 22:33:28 I think it is fake snake skin he has the oil to go with it 
879 2018-10-18 22:33:28 ulo mo oil hahaha 
880 2018-10-18 22:33:27 thats not what neoliberalism is, it's free markets and speculate, speculate, speculate on foreign assets of fixed resource like oil or real estate then hold on to it till the price spikes and sell.
881 2018-10-18 22:33:27 What was the reserve when PDP was selling oil for over 100 dollars per barrel?
882 2018-10-18 22:33:18 If Mr McGuire was so in tune to the NHL, he would long have had a GM job long by now...I had to laugh when he missed on the Habs job & him moaning to Melnick what he would have done for the umpteenth time...NHL Owners r far to smart not to spot a snake oil salesman...
883 2018-10-18 22:33:07 One correction. The U.S. produces around 11 million barrels of oil per day (mmbopd) but consumes almost 20 mmbopd. You  probably thought this because we export a few mmbopd. That’s because our refineries were built decades ago and weren’t designed to handle high gravity shale oil
884 2018-10-18 22:32:49 Lmao. Danfo drivers will bash you and bring out groundnut oil from under their seat to clean it up. 

This country is trips.

891 2018-10-18 22:32:20 You are missing the entire teachings of the NT life if your theology does not take u beyond the thief. You are surely dressed in white, you have a lamp, you wait for His coming, but not enough oil to understand Rom 6,7,8?
892 2018-10-18 22:32:19 You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil and joy.
893 2018-10-18 22:32:13 do women KNOW what a stick shift IS? do WOMEN know how to DRIVE? automobiles are for MEN because they have GAS and OIL and they’re hundreds of pounds of PURE METAL

913 2018-10-18 22:30:03 Oh and one more thing. You do understand why @BetoORourke want to put this strict regulations on fracking and pumping oil? Do you? He told you, that we are almost running out of time to save Earth, and this regulations will protect environment! There is no planet B!
914 2018-10-18 22:30:00 Pierce. Did you watch the same debate everyone else watched. Ted Cruz mopped he floor with that young bud. He was a pure rookie next to Cruz. I called him a “Dying  Socialist” afraid to show his real true colors. Snake oil salesman

ネタの延長線上でやってるみたいだけど好きじゃないんだ…
916 2018-10-18 22:29:49 actually oil is bad for business if the US is not controlling it..rest assured. .they wil sabotage  it..ask Venezuela, Iraq, Iran..
917 2018-10-18 22:29:45 
918 2018-10-18 22:29:37 Because the repercussions cost a lot of buck and oil.
919 2018-10-18 22:29:28 Lol yesterdays own wasn’t as good. I needed to add more palm oil I think. But it was still fire tasting
920 2018-10-18 22:29:23 When oil gets volatile w/ factors pulling each side, it's worth tracking separately, the impact on currencies by the direct price & related investments. The Canadian $, for instance, falls more by the falling investments in oil, one of its major exports.
921 2018-10-18 22:29:18 Like coconut oil?
922 2018-10-18 22:29:17 So i ordered a italion hoagie from wawa and i get in the car start eating it just to realize they fucking put ketchup on it??? I asked for mayo and oil??? Wtf??? Wawa sucks
923 2018-10-18 22:29:14 おはようございます(*^^*)
924 2018-10-18 22:29:00 In what?  Crisco, butter, corn oil ........
925 2018-10-18 22:28:44 そんなイメージ無いんですが、そういう人もいるんですね
926 2018-10-18 22:28:30 @TheFive @KennedyNation says Environmentalists push America to dictators like Saudi Arabia for oil. We should consider that before banning offshore drilling in Florida and encourage @marcorubio, @SenBillNelson or @ScottforFlorida to remove the U.S. prohibition. Vote NO on 9.
927 2018-10-18 22:28:15 This is what I joined Twitter for!!...Roast (par boiled and in olive oil!!!!)
All day!!!!!
928 2018-10-18 22:28:14 All of our machinery at work tells our bosses if the oil needs changed or if we go over certain rpm's  or mph 
929 2018-10-18 22:28:04 We aren’t continuing on our current path. Things are changing, but throwing everyone in the oil industry and feeder industries out of work isn’t viable. The planet isn’t going to die in 12yrs, that’s propaganda.
930 2018-10-18 22:28:02 His skin could use some oil
931 2018-10-18 22:27:46 You literally get an oil check every month if you’re a Saudi citizen and if the king dies, you get a bonus so as to prevent civil unrest.
932 2018-10-18 22:27:42 My wife is she produces a deadly gas called H2S it kills people in the oil and gas industry.
933 2018-10-18 22:27:40 Thanks for your commitment to more electric cars and less oil driven cars and all what comes with it
934 2018-10-18 22:27:39 Twitterポエマー嫌いだけどハサドシュウヘイは面白いから好き
935 2018-10-18 22:27:23 I often wonder what powershifts will  happen when all the oil and  gas runs out...
936 2018-10-18 22:27:15 Olive Oil 
937 2018-10-18 22:27:13 Sage tho  better choice than oil of lavender 
938 2018-10-18 22:27:10 And the saudis will continue to not give a hoot. Sat on oil that the US needs. Step out of line and they raise the cost of petro and nosedive is economy. Fall back in line, drop trou and take the Saudi dic....I mean cash.
939 2018-10-18 22:27:09 お茶会コスの染色、暗めの赤か暗めの緑かで悩む・・・
940 2018-10-18 22:27:02 BenefitsBlues is...  a woman sitting next to me pulling out Olbas oil from her bag & holding it under her nose as it dawns on me that the unpleasant smell is me. That's what the combination of depressive lethargy & lack of money that rations the deodorant & shower gel looks like.
941 2018-10-18 22:26:54 said nobody except you in my mentions.  Come on Kurtzy....oil derrick is so Rexall Place.  Besides, the price of Oil is still struggling, we need to change it up bro! Hey btw, how are the roads looking coming into the downtown?
942 2018-10-18 22:26:45 In other words, as far as Trump is concerned, the "not a positive" aspect is NOT that a human being was butchered while still alive.And by a regime the West buys oil from. No, per Trump,the "not a positive thing" is that the civilized world actually cares about this. Charming....
943 2018-10-18 22:26:38 What renewable resource can take over what oil can do? All energy shouldn't have any subsidies but they all do
944 2018-10-18 22:26:21 Now I must commit "unction" to memory, too, particularly its definition as "the action of anointing someone with oil or ointment as a religious rite or as a symbol of investiture as a monarch." That's how we got Galioto, no?
945 2018-10-18 22:26:20 The way in sat in Nigeria when he was VP but busy helping himself with the resources of the nation. From NPA to oil bunkering
946 2018-10-18 22:26:15 Each an every country that has been depends on oil has been in recession, may you don't know about Venezuela, where a common pad reached almost 3000000 of their money.
947 2018-10-18 22:26:12 If you run out of brush cleanser and you need to give your tools a quick clean, simply wash with olive oil and rinse them out with hot water
948 2018-10-18 22:26:01 What a bullshit article. Saudi is the sponsor of most of the terrorism along with USA of course. Also the world can do without Saudi’s oil, which will bankrupt the country in no time. The USA taxpayers will be richer with out Saudi extortion.
949 2018-10-18 22:26:00 Oil change appointment at 4 and here it is 6:30 and I'm still waiting TF!!! 
950 2018-10-18 22:25:44 The Surprising Reason That Oil Subsidies Persist: Even Liberals Love Them
951 2018-10-18 22:25:34 Was going to say peanut butter but the comments informed me of palm oil so guess thats the end of kit kats for me
952 2018-10-18 22:25:33 In NLRB v Murphy Oil. It effectively detoothed the NLRB, and collective bargaining as a concept!
953 2018-10-18 22:25:33 My daughter has a problem but I do not think that she has had hers specifically identified. She is worse when oil seed rape is in flower but I think she is better now than when she was younger.  I must ask her. It  can make life miserable at certain times I think?
954 2018-10-18 22:25:18 Not saying China doesn't do it's own deeds. But this isn't a case in whataboutisms. The notion that the U$ doesn't get any of it's wealth from outside it's borders is absurd.

You don't think Exxon gets oil from Africa?
955 2018-10-18 22:25:15 Sanctions loom for Saudi Arabia as evidence mounts it may be behind Khashoggi murder. I WOULDN'T WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT AN OIL EMBARGO (UNLESS YOU'RE FROM OZ WHERE WE DON'T REFINE ANY OIL) ALL THE PRINCES WANT THEIR GOLD PLATED FERRARIS, YACHTS & AIRLINERS FAR TOO MUCH.
956 2018-10-18 22:25:15 Having studied cult behavior... They are definitely brainwashed. It’s unfortunate that so many people fall for the snake oil
957 2018-10-18 22:25:04 If Turkey has this so called tape, why are they refusing to produce it. Remember world, it was Turkey who was buying oil off from Isis as the ran like rabid dogs killing none other than hmmm a journalist.

4 more hours at work then walk home, start an olive oil treatment on my hair, and don’t eat-just drink water.

967 2018-10-18 22:23:54 Free oil changes tho
968 2018-10-18 22:23:53 @HillaryClinton And now because the Global Financial Systems STocksters and Banksters want a war with Russia for money or to cut off the Oil as they own run OPEC want oil prices to become crippling to the world again want another world war like the 2 they did before the coming
969 2018-10-18 22:23:35 Yes a mob type hit with his prints on it was inevitable. I wonder if an oil war or two was also inevitable from oil family man, bogus potus 1?
970 2018-10-18 22:23:27 Oil can be contaminated like that, but I know from what I saw and my friends who worked in the kitchen all the Veg products were picked up with a different set of tongs and placed in different oil vats
971 2018-10-18 22:23:20 Now we can stand with #saudi’s to stop the oil flow to the world against humanity let’ s see who is going to start the first WAR for oil france/brittain/usa we will see the#TRUTH
972 2018-10-18 22:23:03 They're using that oil money to buy Western assets 

They'll be fine when the oil dries up
973 2018-10-18 22:22:58 If you take #SaudiArabia oil away, it's just a weak 3rd world country. It's people are cruel & arrogant.
974 2018-10-18 22:22:54 Is the thieves essential oil okay to burn around dogs?? 
975 2018-10-18 22:22:49 Dear all - please check you are using the right immersion media for your objective lens! As a user found out today, WAY MORE SIGNAL when you use oil with oil objective! #microscopy #noonetoblamebutmyselftheteacher
976 2018-10-18 22:22:40 Basically, I used to work at a 24/hr Mcds, so it was never shut (except on Xmas day) so I never witnessed this filteration system but I did see every now and then someone who did the maintenance etc would change the oil to a fresh batch of oil. I can’t say for SURE if the (cont)

980 2018-10-18 22:22:23 Well, if that's the case I can totally see why the Oil are using this bridge then.  #message
981 2018-10-18 22:22:23 Bring back the oil derrick.
982 2018-10-18 22:22:13 Yes it actually does but @VegNews before said that it came from "sustainable palm oil" and they never said anything bad about @ICBINotButter when they had sponsored them
983 2018-10-18 22:22:12 The Feds bought them off over their bluff to leave confederation. Alberta needs to form a western coalition with Northern B.C. and Saskatchewan. Seek self-determination. It’s the only way we’ll have our own voice, and the right to freely develop oil and gas.
984 2018-10-18 22:22:11 A Cronut is a croissant-doughnut pastry. The pastry resembles a doughnut and is made from croissant-like dough which is filled with flavored cream and fried in oil. Or so they say...ain’t never had me one, ackshully.
985 2018-10-18 22:22:10 @bokabokchicken What kind of oil do you fry in?
986 2018-10-18 22:22:08 @HillaryClinton We will have war with Russia because you missed the fact you were at 50 percent and Obama came out to support you and you dropped to about 13 percent when I told him what was going on and said stand up against the oil line and he got you back even with Trump

990 2018-10-18 22:21:34 My partner is blue collar, also. He’s in oil and gas, which can be very up and down in terms of job security. We just came off a year-long stint of no work. Not sure how we’ll recover. But we don’t get health ins or unemployment or 401k. Looking at an ugly retirement.

995 2018-10-18 22:20:55 Norway is in in EEA/EFTA/Schengen, has free movement (higher immigration % than UK), is a rule taker, can't do free trade deals. It saved its North Sea oil $. Thatcher frittered ours on tax cuts. Even ignoring that, leaving is different - and far worse - from never having joined.
996 2018-10-18 22:20:44 On the other hand, people used to get boiled in oil... No reason that can't come back in special cases.
997 2018-10-18 22:20:43 That’s your opinion. If you actually knew the Bible, you’d correct his lies yourself. So much for the Glory to God you don’t give. You defend snake oil heretics. I’m not ashamed so go try that line on the people in his amazon reviews that burned his books for blasphemy.

1000 2018-10-18 22:19:52 Being aware of this issue, I try to avoid products with palm oil where possible. Occasionally, I’ll see some labeled as ‘sustainably harvested palm oil’. Is this a real thing? Seems like there’s room for a lot of interpretation there.
1001 2018-10-18 22:19:47 This is outdated. That used to be true. These guys are eager to buy Russian and Chinese weapons also and so if we come down hard they can raise the price of oil and take their business elsewhere. I'm not saying do nothing but every act has consequences.
1002 2018-10-18 22:19:43 Every mainstream game site is snake oil huckster bullshit

1004 2018-10-18 22:19:17 Infuse garlic and mullein into oil (ie Canola or olive oil) let it cool, put it on cotton balls and put into affected ear several times / day
1005 2018-10-18 22:19:11 Anything with moisture.. that’s why when you get them they tell you to not get them wet. Things like Vaseline, baby oil, or eye make up remover. And you can use a q-tip to apply it to your lash line with out getting it in your eye.

1009 2018-10-18 22:18:55 IT IS TIME TO STOP RELYING ON OIL AND NATURAL GAS AS OUR MAIN ENERGY SOURCES. OUR NATION IS TOO ADVANCED TO BE SETTING THIS EXAMPLE FOR THE WORLD. OT IS TIME TO SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT AND HELP THE WORLD
1010 2018-10-18 22:18:51 @WaxLiquidizer wondering why my oil when I make it, it's clear as can be when I make my cartridges.. but half way Thur the cartridge the oil turns blackish..?
1011 2018-10-18 22:18:40 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
1012 2018-10-18 22:18:38 He wasnt a US resident.. While I think what they did was wrong lets not pretend that EVERY administration since FDR has been complicit to the Saudi's Money money and oil. Yes even Obama and Clinton. So now Trump is complicit just like them and the sky is falling?
1013 2018-10-18 22:18:27 Yeeeeessssss.... but their oil is so, so sweet.......
1014 2018-10-18 22:18:08 That's fine tell them to stick it we have our own oil which makes their reserves look like a drop in a bucket. Drill baby drill.
1015 2018-10-18 22:17:55 There is one, and only one, reason why the Saudi's are America's "friend", OIL. The thing America must do is significantly decrease our use of oil.
1016 2018-10-18 22:17:54 This is where sustainable palm oil can have some benefit. Some companies I have worked with in PNG now have a no habitat loss policy in recent years. Seems like a positive step but needs more buy in!
1017 2018-10-18 22:17:53 Start carrying pepper spray, the big one like they use on bears in Alaska. And use it if someone invades your personal space or maybe skunk oil. A little dab'll do ya.

I’ve calmed down quite a bit. 
1037 2018-10-18 22:15:44 Is this a sign that in the future the Oil will be doing lots of bridge contracts?

1039 2018-10-18 22:15:35 It used to be a much higher percentage until we had a Conservative government sold it out to a rip and ship mentality, much like Alberta and oil, don't upgrade or refine their products.

1046 2018-10-18 22:14:52 I feel they have little choice in the matter given reliance on fossil fuels. SA has roughly 30% global oil reserves. Can US afford a +$300/b oil price? Wouldn’t lead to a global recession? US and globe is hostage to SA.

1050 2018-10-18 22:14:40 Here's a fun healthy cooking tip: If you add a touch of olive oil to your pan of kale, it will help slide it into the garbage. ~ Craig :)
1051 2018-10-18 22:14:39 You can shine leather shoes with a cloth and some vegetable oil.
1052 2018-10-18 22:14:36 A few more days?  Oil based paint requiring more time to dry?  What a disgrace.
1053 2018-10-18 22:14:29 Foolish that we use #gas, #oil, and minerals etc when the sun is an #unlimited #free #source. I pray it’s not our downfall.  #solarpower #solarenergy #energy #power #solar #Earth #destruction #biosphere #climatechange #humanity #standtogether #change
1054 2018-10-18 22:14:18 "The whitest and nastiest things in the world cannot be fondled or even pursued - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
1055 2018-10-18 22:14:12 As an American, you should be ashamed of yourself for omitting the oil.
Other than that, I usually use vegetable broth in my Béchamel too, gives it a nice colour and damn good taste.
1056 2018-10-18 22:14:03 Asylum refugee status should be processed and evaluated IN MEXICO. Irregular movement through Mexico to the U.S border should be stopped by Mexico.  
It would benefit Mexico by not enriching cartels and this would reduce violence in Mexico.
1057 2018-10-18 22:14:00 @HotelChocolat do you use palm oil in your chocolate? I’m sure you’ve answered this question many, many times, if so please could you make it clear on your ingredients list on your website? Thank you #palmoil
1058 2018-10-18 22:13:58 Things learned this week: oil/money is more important than human life, Canada is light yrs ahead of us, posturing about Israel more important than trade with Indo and the LNP is running scared. I will (not) pray for CoalMo 
1059 2018-10-18 22:13:47 Palm oil is in almost everything 
I want the countries that export it to have a viable money source, but I cannot support this product due to the impact on my favorite great ape, the orangutan. How can I help both causes?
1060 2018-10-18 22:13:37 You know what's cooking? Me cooking eggs without fvcking oil
1061 2018-10-18 22:13:29 The US is more focus on Iran. As stated in the article collapse of both Iran and Venezuelan oil exports would send prices through the roof and in election year that's bad. And then there is uncertainty over Saudi Arabia.
1062 2018-10-18 22:13:26 Yea I always forget that down there....Too used to no water let alone oil
1063 2018-10-18 22:13:15 No no no no.  They are not. They are snake oil for the gullible and desperate.
1064 2018-10-18 22:13:07 Very good question and the answer is oil.
1065 2018-10-18 22:13:01 Per the article - the Turkstream pipeline is slated to open next year...phase 1 delivers Russian gas to Turkey; phase 2 includes sales to EU via Greece.  $150/barrel oil as a result of KSA sanctions would increase EU demand which they would then be able to supply (in theory)
1066 2018-10-18 22:12:52 95% of the Ecuadorian coast is deforested mainly in large part due to the palm oil farms
1067 2018-10-18 22:12:50 Honestly? I want my head to be always covered in coconut oil

1070 2018-10-18 22:12:16 Having Jiffy Lube change the oil in my truck since it’s cheaper than doing it myself. 

At least there’s free coffee and Matlock on the TV.
1071 2018-10-18 22:11:53 u should get palmers coconut oil leave in conditioner n ogx have a coconut water spray i use both n it helps so much literally if i dnt use them my hair pure snaps when i brush it :)))) pure comes out in clumps without them
1072 2018-10-18 22:11:47 Heb 4:6-8, 10:29, No oil, bury talent, act like goats not sheep, salt lost savour, hid our light, branch & fig tree with no fruit, lost first love, lukewarm, takeaway from the word, ashamed of Him, deny Him, Didn't do His will. Eph 4:30 in context sis or we r false teachers!
1073 2018-10-18 22:11:45 (Oil was always marginal as electricity production - lumped in as "other" in some forecasts)
1074 2018-10-18 22:11:45 happy alaska day, let us remember that 10 years ago this month, senator ted “tubes” stevens of alaska was convicted on corruption charges for letting an oil company paint his house in exchange for deregulating the industry, and then dying in one of that company’s private planes
1075 2018-10-18 22:11:41 Nah, that is the current political correct opinion. Reality is that wood is the most sustainable fuel there is: you chop down a tree, plant a new one and you always have fuel. Oil runs out, and so does gas. CO2 actually is good. Chemicals? That is the trash we need to get rid of.
1076 2018-10-18 22:11:37 They used oil from a head gasket for grease, looks like. #ThatsYourProblemRightThere
1077 2018-10-18 22:11:36 I need to pick a private college before Christmas....but I promise my dad I wouldn’t pick without him but he comes back week after the due date...my dad works offshore on the oil rigs I only get to see him 2 months out of the year. I don’t know what to do.
1078 2018-10-18 22:11:23 I can sum up the job I'm transcribing right now as bullshit, bullshit, snake oil, cloudcuckooland. But I'm making $13 off of it so... carry on, con artist guy.
1079 2018-10-18 22:11:20 Picked this baby up on Quintessa. Nice folks, the Quintessons. Give you a good deal and... mh.. aaall the oil you can drink.
1080 2018-10-18 22:11:18 Tracing back to when my skin started wilding out and I just realised it was when I started using these oil sheen hairsprays or whatever 

The breakout is SOOO BAD I don't even wanna leave the house omgee

1082 2018-10-18 22:11:00 EOTP-dem-inspired media hits Trump hard when stocks fall, oil prices go up, or the 'debt' runs at not even half of Obamas...  But have these things move the opposite direction, and 'shhhh'... you might only hear nancy pelosi's  gavel-to-be  go, 'thud'... COMPETENT as she is.

1084 2018-10-18 22:10:46 When Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar run out of oil, they want their economy to be tourist based. I wouldn't even have a stopover in those countries. #tytlive
1085 2018-10-18 22:10:46 For EVERYONE who goes to a place to get their OIL CHANGED, and the mechanic comes back say you need everything else and it’s mother. Tell them kindly “Good to know, I’ll get a second opinion from my mechanic - thank you for the oil change” and pay for ONLY the oil change!
1086 2018-10-18 22:10:40 Well Deserved!!! 

I pray that the oil in your ministry will never run dry 

I love youuuu  
1087 2018-10-18 22:10:39 What is this story really about? Is it about the failed Saudi oil IPO? It is 100% NOT about some killed obscure journalist. What’s the real story.
1088 2018-10-18 22:10:33 I was just bout to cop some peppermint oil 
1089 2018-10-18 22:10:31 My mom was told to get some cbd oil for her neck, and this is the conversation that followed 

My aunt: “so is hemp marijuana?”
Mom: “kinda but you don’t get a high from hemp.”
Aunt: “well dern what’s the point in having it?”
1090 2018-10-18 22:10:27 Old enough to know he has more character in his pinky than Trump has in his whole body. He was the only former President willing to give Trump a chance. His Presidency was mired in economic difficulties from 8 yrs of previous REPUBLICAN  rule. Remember the oil crisis?
1091 2018-10-18 22:10:21 Man... got a an oil change and paid off some Parkin tickets, none of that shit is fun... turn me up

1094 2018-10-18 22:10:15 Cattle prosper in the shadow of an oil (water) well
1095 2018-10-18 22:10:15 Natural gas is definitely the belle of the ball right now, but EVs are going to make oil production useless, and wind is pushing coal out of the wholesale markets at night. Cheaper to mothball a plant than compete with coal.
1096 2018-10-18 22:10:15 need me an oil field king who goes out at 6 am every morning and gets that coin in this cold weather
God Bless You
1097 2018-10-18 22:10:13 A national embarrassment and a political atrocity: Canada, blessed with more crude oil reserves than only Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, is compelled to sell it at a discount >$50/Bbl to WTI.

1106 2018-10-18 22:09:26 in my liquid lipstick :

Avocado oil- comforts & nutrition for lips
Grape Seed oil- nourish skin
Jojoba oil- forms a barrier that locks moisture & keep lips baby soft
Sweet Almond oil- prevents chapped lips & keeps them moisturized
Vitamin E- soothe even appearance of skin tone
1107 2018-10-18 22:09:20 You do realize they prop up the petrodollar and hold about 166.8 billion + (possible 750 bill) in US debt?  How far are you willing to go with oil prices, world trade currency stat, and morts/loans to punish them?
1108 2018-10-18 22:09:12 Trump and co-horts are saying that we need Saudi Arabia. We don't need their oil anymore, we don't need the arms sales ( only proposed anyway). Saudi's are committing horrendous war crimes in Yemen and 15 of the 19 who attacked us on 9/11 were Saudi's. Trump and Kushner need them
1109 2018-10-18 22:09:10 You don't come to a NATO country and chop someone in pieces, we need the oil, we should instruct our military to take it from these barabarians with extreme force!  Old-fashioned way, this left-weakness has gone on long enough, an must stop, we must play hard in this world!
1110 2018-10-18 22:08:50 Saudi Arabia is not a ally....they're a client for our weapons trade just like we are their client for oil...there is no shared morality governmently speaking
1111 2018-10-18 22:08:44 I’ve just put Peppermint oil on my trash hairline and I can FEEL IT SO MUCH.

Why do you think they created Dubai as a tourist resort and have 100's of other businesses?

They need something post oil...

1116 2018-10-18 22:08:17 A slight blow against your Davy oil lamp will extinguish it, and to light it again you will have to find a place where there is no fire damp. Take a long time looking for the place.
1117 2018-10-18 22:08:11 Wonder if Trump is negotiating the price of oil while a story both countries can agree to is crafted
1118 2018-10-18 22:08:07 If thoughtful means selling our public lands to oil/gas/mining.
1119 2018-10-18 22:08:03 XD! Thank you- that is the original color way I had planned for this one. I’m still not sure what way to go for the oil layers but I’m tempted to properly digitally color so that all the colorways are around in some form.
1120 2018-10-18 22:08:00 He has to build his army so when he is impeached there will be civil war. Divide and conquer. Selling his snake oil cure all cleansing potion. Selling something to the American people we already own.
1121 2018-10-18 22:07:46 Bunch of goat fuckers found oil by mistake on the eve of a world war. Only reason why it wasnt carpet bombed back to the stone age.
1122 2018-10-18 22:07:39 Holy shit how much $$$ did you waste on oil?
1123 2018-10-18 22:07:38 A separate, but related question is how much do we care where that money comes from?

Are gate receipts somehow more legitimate than oil wealth? I would argue not for Mino Raiola ...

1128 2018-10-18 22:06:19 Clearly palm oil plantations cover a large % of Borneo and have resulted in a lot of deforestation of native forest. What do you think the future holds? Is palm oil going to continue to expand, or are the palm oil companies realising that they need to conserve remaining forest?
1129 2018-10-18 22:06:15 I knew companies at a career fair who would t even talk to you if you weren’t a certain gpa. Especially the oil companies like bp, chevron and novelty companies like Tesla  etc

1134 2018-10-18 22:05:36 Some in the industry believe Sauds have been faking oil reserve numbers for a generation & have been over exploiting. What if they're looking at the possibility that the oil is running out. Is this all a play to grab as much global power as they can, while they can?

Keep that narrative going Nigel, I'm sure you find it preferable to admitting you were selling xenophobic snake oil.

1142 2018-10-18 22:04:48 Sanctions eventually worked against South Africa and changed things. The only difference is that Saudi has more oil.
1143 2018-10-18 22:04:40 All in all I'm just glad I wasn't born in Zimbabwe. These people don't even have cooking oil. smh
1144 2018-10-18 22:04:37 Call me crazy, but the time for outrage regarding KSA was in the 70s. You turned a blind eye towards that mistake of a country because it kept your corporations nice and fat and your oil flowing. Where was the outrage re: Yemen? Right, they're the alien Other. Fuck off.
1145 2018-10-18 22:04:37 Dropped my phone in a pot of oil how’s your day going ?
1146 2018-10-18 22:04:32 Nothing we can do pointless posturing Saudis own us, 2 nd largest global oil producer so big they can bring world to recession depression at flick of a switch and the only Brit owned successful exports are Arms and Saudi buys shit loads from us, better to be quiet and move along
1147 2018-10-18 22:04:25 especally if you get pepperoni in your sandwich? and that good sandwich oil? yummmmm

tho this works with all sammiches~
1148 2018-10-18 22:04:22 I am sorry you have Lupus. My daughter and ex-wife both suffer with it too. Other than narcotic pain meds, CBD oil drops is the only product that manages their pain. And it works good without any narcotic effects.
1149 2018-10-18 22:04:15 new doctor mine retired  I told her  I hate meds we agreed that some meds do work and then I told her I take hemp oil and she told me that it is a good product and she was glad I am taking it  I was shocked
1150 2018-10-18 22:04:13 doesn't seem complicated, it's just not enough for my skin. i use pretty strong cleansers or i break out pretty quick. tried an oil face-wash and had to use a wash again after.
1151 2018-10-18 22:04:11 Yes but we need their oil! That’s the problem!
1152 2018-10-18 22:04:07 Beard oil... pffffft...

Real men use beard balm.
1153 2018-10-18 22:04:01 The tech has been here it's just been big oil controlling this crap. There should be no gas cars now but for some reason my phone has better tech than my car.

1160 2018-10-18 22:03:20 Mistakes of past history: Which government policies in Venezuela made people dirt poor, despite massive oil wealth?  Why do communist countries build walls to keep people in, not out? How many tens of millions of people have been killed by Marxism around world?

1164 2018-10-18 22:02:48 The scientist of the 50's told the UN we had to stop burning oil products as well as pouring other toxins in the atmosphere. The planet had less than 100 years of breathable air. We are now seeing the affects they said would happen. Disease and chronic sickness highest ever.
1165 2018-10-18 22:02:45 They need to really invest in renewable tech so we don't rely on their oil. Tiny turbines in public fences. Small turbines on railway embankments and motorway embankments. The French developed a tiny turbine system a few years ago. Lack of political will for it do you think?

1171 2018-10-18 22:02:07 Heads up friends, I am going to be retweeting a bunch of tweets from a campaign in WA. If you hate big oil and want a clean air, you’ll be in heaven. If not... errrr... ummm... that’s awkward.
1172 2018-10-18 22:02:06 I eat a lot of eggs, cheese, bacon and some avocado. I try to put coconut oil everywhere I can. I didn't really get keto flu outside of being tired the first day or so.
1173 2018-10-18 22:01:50 It’s either constipation or too much beard oil ... not sure which.
1174 2018-10-18 22:01:49 I'm sorry to have to say this but Hieda, your nothing but another Republican money grubber. I'm sure when Ted gets defeated he'll get a lobbing job for big oil and you'll get your payback. Why don't you start worrying about people that can't pay their electric bill.
1175 2018-10-18 22:01:46 And old bones make oil. Maybe they were put there already old so that the oil is there when we need it.

Like oil burning last year. They forgot most cars have an aux oil tank in the system which needed to be monitored.  Kept very quiet on that ommision but now a TR section all of its own!!
1178 2018-10-18 22:01:19 Ur comment Is like when the drunk guy in the films looks at his whisky bottle - cos he’s just heard or seen something unbelievably strange - that’s your comment!! 3 of my leave voting friends are coming on the march with me this Sat.  Get some oil for your joints...
1179 2018-10-18 22:01:19 Keep your pantry and freezer stocked with canned and frozen veggies so you’ll always have a quick and easy option for snacks and meals. Just heat, season with salt and pepper, and add a healthy fat like coconut oil.
1180 2018-10-18 22:01:19 my mom just bought some castor oil  we both don’t want a scorpio kid lol
1181 2018-10-18 22:01:18 Because an independent Alberta would have a much easier time getting oil to tidewater?
1182 2018-10-18 22:01:15 She will say oral for oil LOL
1183 2018-10-18 22:00:50 don't forget the blood oil the east happily buys from Saudi Arabia to keep dictators in power.
1184 2018-10-18 22:00:48 He wasn't an oil bunkerer when he was in APC in 2015 while campaigning for PMB, you were too cool to associate with him then...abeg find better thing talk jarr
1185 2018-10-18 22:00:46 The best thing the world can do is get off oil as much as possible as soon as possible. #bbcqt
1186 2018-10-18 22:00:45 EPA weighs allowing oil companies to pump wastewater into rivers, streams #noalfracking #nãofrackingbrasil #nofracking
1187 2018-10-18 22:00:34 Thought I was smart and healthy using olive oil with some spices as a light salad dressing and I’ve never had a worst taste in my mouth????? I’m so upset

1191 2018-10-18 22:00:01 i’m vexed...  i need beard oil
1192 2018-10-18 22:00:00 Iran oil export increased %10 in September compare to October based on @TankerTrackers reports! #Iransanctions
1193 2018-10-18 21:59:51 Those who moan about the #UK selling #Arms to Saudi is one those who call for it, should go & face each & every person who will lose their jobs in our heavy armament industries or the fact they can simply turn the tap of oil off.   #BBCQT
1194 2018-10-18 21:59:50 Saudi Arabia couldn’t give a rats arse about sanctions. They’ll just raise the oil price and screw up western economies.
1195 2018-10-18 21:59:47 A Yemeni life, even that of a child, clearly has less value to @Conservatives when we have huge arms deals and fear increased oil process #bbcqt
1196 2018-10-18 21:59:47 Saudis not a country we should be dealing with. Beheadings, outrageous treatment of women and the 'reforms' show no sign of democracy. We need to get away from oil dependence and arms sales. #bbcqt
1197 2018-10-18 21:59:46 It’s just a pity all the oil is under horrible countries #bbcqt
1198 2018-10-18 21:59:34 You don't want to be blackmailed by the Saudis over oil supplies? Invest in renewables then. Scotland already runs on them #BBCQT
1199 2018-10-18 21:59:34 We're still using oil.....evaluation done!
1200 2018-10-18 21:59:33 you say this like it’s easy lol literally every time I feel a bit of bravery I find myself coating my hair with oil and masks and shit
1201 2018-10-18 21:59:22 Someone needs to go in there and ask her if she does or oil painting, asking for a friend
1202 2018-10-18 21:59:19 I hear that's not happening until the price of oil goes above $100! #Crudejoke
1203 2018-10-18 21:59:18 #bbcqt re SA its oil dear boy oil Remember remember the 5th November aka 3 day week & hyperinflation
1204 2018-10-18 21:59:10 Resident. Sanctions - okay. Lets expand US oil production and dump the entire Middle East and OPEC. #BOOSAUDIS
1205 2018-10-18 21:59:07 #bbcqt

Lightweight panel Mr Dimbleby, whose fault could that be, bbc?

Saudis own our governments and do as they please.

Oil.

There is no shortage of "brutal autocrats" in this world.

Casualty minimization.
1206 2018-10-18 21:59:06 There's plenty of other oil around. #bbcqt

1210 2018-10-18 21:58:48 It's amazing That You try to blame another country's problems on the democrats, which comprise roughly half of this country, you're country. While you grease the palms of murderous Saudi's for oil money. You are despicable #worstpresidentever
1211 2018-10-18 21:58:43 because oil company executives are really the good guys, and scientists are eeevil. 
1212 2018-10-18 21:58:40 Saudi has oil and money so the UK wont do a thing.
1213 2018-10-18 21:58:25 Take your oil and shove it!
1214 2018-10-18 21:58:21 Vitamin E oil maybe? Real good on scars n blemishes
1215 2018-10-18 21:58:15 @bbc5live #bbcqt #saudiarabia it's not just the 25% of everything BAE produce sold  saudi arabia it's also saudi have the ability 2 manipulate the oil price which affects the cost of pretty much everything which is y saudi arabia have a special relationship with western countries

1218 2018-10-18 21:58:09 The Land & resources in Britain is not enough....they must go to other people’s lands and steal it, steal the resources and destroy homes like vampires and barbarians. What else is terrorism? Isn’t British land,gold,oil, diamond grabbing an act of TERRORISM?
1219 2018-10-18 21:58:02 Trump is building a house of cards. Inflation, deficits, debt, rising interest rates, tariffs, oil prices, loss of trust from key allies, pressure on the dollar, etc.  The Dow is showing early signs of the trouble that is coming.
1220 2018-10-18 21:57:59 They are all talk. Just wait till Salman house of Saud chap causes oil price to rocket. Poor Khashoggi will be another state sponsored dead man.  #bbcqt
1221 2018-10-18 21:57:45 thing is, you can say not to sell arms to saudi, but at the same time, maybe we should stop buying oil from them? they're not the only place to buy oil from  #bbcqt
1222 2018-10-18 21:57:40 a $120 and they ain’t give you no oil or lotion wow but they cute 
1223 2018-10-18 21:57:37 I think Bernie is the only national-level Dem who is serious about the climate yes. It's not about age, it's about donors and he's the only one not bought out by big oil, big pharma and wall st.
1224 2018-10-18 21:57:35 I need a oil treatment
1225 2018-10-18 21:57:33 You know those "liberals" are Americans too?

Trump won on a catchphrase and snake oil sales. 

He told Forgotten America what they wanted to hear, he demonized the press and the Democrats, and you guys ate it up.
1226 2018-10-18 21:57:23 Syria has lots of oil, much of it is in the NW, currently occupied by USA, turkey and their pet terrorists, ISIS, there is also lots in the Golan, currently occupied by Israel and Murdoch's Genie energy.
1227 2018-10-18 21:57:09 Arms, jobs, oil, ‘friendships’...
1228 2018-10-18 21:57:00 The reversed Magician is the snake oil salesman, the illusionist with empty promises.  You may have infinite possibilities, but there are things which are truly impossible. Don’t be easily fooled.
1229 2018-10-18 21:56:57 Really? Let’s see the references for these numbers, please? Personally I never see poor people driving a Tesla! They are much more likely to have a ‘74 Buick Le Sabre that uses as much oil as gas! Or a 2 cycle scooter that blows pure oil into the atmosphere. Yes, where are the #s
1230 2018-10-18 21:56:56 Her scalp has been flaring for about a month, I think. It's dry and flaky, but using oil to combat the dryness seems to irritate it, too.
1231 2018-10-18 21:56:54 It appears the oil is running low today.

2. My oil light came on 
3. "Low brake fluid. Service now" 
4. Something on my windshield popped off. 

Ford gonna get mooooneyyyyy tomorrow . All in a week. Fml.
1234 2018-10-18 21:56:28 Can the politicians and the Government start to recognise what is 'Good' and what is 'Bad' before considering your arms sale, oil reserves, religious allegiance?
1235 2018-10-18 21:56:04 If you work in the oil and gas industry, take a look at what's happened to coal.  Renewables have gotten cheaper and will continue to do so.  The market has spoken, the end is nigh.
1236 2018-10-18 21:56:00 The Saudi's air on 20% of the planet's oil. They think that because of this they can act like barbarians.

1239 2018-10-18 21:55:49 @bbcquestiontime #bbcqt  We have kissed up to the oil rich states of the middle east too much as they kick us behind our backs. We public known they two faced to often people who

1243 2018-10-18 21:55:25 #bbcqt listen no one is going to say anything to Saudi Arabia about the human right because let's face it we all love to drive our cars and they have the oil
1244 2018-10-18 21:55:09 We could invade them and just take the oil
1245 2018-10-18 21:55:07 Easy to cook, destone the beans, wash, add water, seasoning, palm oil, onions, tomato, pepper, Cover the pot, put on hot plate, go and play ball, by the time you return, food is ready!
1246 2018-10-18 21:55:05 Yes we did all that but we have control of the #oil and #heroin trade so we’re chuffed. If you think we’ve done what we’ve done in the #MiddleEast to make brown peoples lives better you’re more stupid than most! #bbcqt
1247 2018-10-18 21:54:58 Maybe you should check Steve Pierce’svoting record.  He was bought and paid for by big oil long ago.
1248 2018-10-18 21:54:57 Quite a few paintings appear as 'oil on panel'. Occasionally it's oil on mahogany, but more commonly it's oak.
1249 2018-10-18 21:54:54 Grab it from the tail, pin it to ur wall then cover it in oil. Start slightly burning until they’re unconscious then unpin them, cut them in like halves or fourths then just start cooking it. Maybe add salt. Then WALA. You made Cristina’s cat a meal 
1250 2018-10-18 21:54:42 That aren’t destined to make old bones. Been disappointed with the availability, we rarely have all 3 on the run. New Engines, gearboxes, transfer boxes, alternators, oil leaks the list goes on. Difficult though to find something else that is 4x4 and carries all the kit.

My kids, no flu shots, never had flu: breastfed, take immune strengthening measures (VitD3, Om3, Kyolic Garlic, Oregano Oil, VitC, Probiotics, low sugar diet), especially during fall/winter.
1276 2018-10-18 21:52:32 #bbcqt what’s happening to the stock market after the Saudi’s threatened to raise the oil price.  Is that not blackmail
1277 2018-10-18 21:52:27 And don’t forget the trillions we spent on Iraq invasion and occupation. The debt service alone will be a trillion for that obscene decision to invade for oil.
1278 2018-10-18 21:52:24 Jstclair:"Lockheed has come to dominate weapons market in a way that the Standard Oil Company used to hold sway over the nation’s petroleum supplies.

1289 2018-10-18 21:51:31 Maybe I should start mixing in some type of oil with my moisturizer
1290 2018-10-18 21:51:30 And where did Sadam get his chemicals from? And his arms? And his intelligence (info)? When he was fighting Iran he was our attack dog. When the US wanted his oil.. .well all of a sudden he was mentioned with every ref to 9/11. Haliburton made billions from that war alone.
1291 2018-10-18 21:51:26 I gotta wait like 45 more minutes for my oil change and they’ve got Fox News on in the waiting room. I’m gonna throw my boot at the tv.

1293 2018-10-18 21:51:02 How is it that you're losing money, the commercials say, you're not increasing production if TMX is built. So I presume that means Cdn's will pay more for gas and oil products. Which is it?
1294 2018-10-18 21:50:50 Where are the intelligence services of France, UK, and Germany on Saudi murder team? Where are Burr and Warner as heads of Intel Comm? We cannot depend on Trump for the truth. Congress must act to punish. Plenty of oil in Canada and Mexico.

1300 2018-10-18 21:50:20 Ppl who are still demonizing Cuba ought to ask how Saudi Arabia compares? A murderous regime that US does not need at all. Per @SteveSchmidtSES : US, Canada, Mexico are energy-independent, we don’t need their oil. They are not our allies (9/11 anyone?). All interaction shld end

1311 2018-10-18 21:49:02 Need to make sure I get an oil change and book my hair appt tomorrow
1312 2018-10-18 21:49:00 Funnily enough I have a client who came to Scotland from Iraq and her account differs , as does that of my brother who worked there . I’m not saying Saddam was an angel , but just who the hell are we to decide what’s right and wrong? I’m sure oil and power motivated Blair
1313 2018-10-18 21:48:46 It’s a disgrace that we in Canada buy Oil from these killers
1314 2018-10-18 21:48:24 And the stock market fell like around 348 today due to uncertainties about the Saudis, the Fed, oil, China, etc. Trump's brinksmanship usually ends with bankruptcies.
1315 2018-10-18 21:48:23 gon be drinking oil out if it at parties
1316 2018-10-18 21:48:03 Wow. Just wow. I thought Trump was supposed to "drain the swamp." Not even the Bush family was this anti-patriotic with their oil interests and the Royal family. This is the "swamp" doesn't matter what the guy was, we can't have countries go around murdering free people. #Soldout
1317 2018-10-18 21:48:03 Can't be a Christian and bisexual the two are like oil and water they are simply not compatible.
1318 2018-10-18 21:48:02 No, she was an ignorant college student and now she's an ignorant snake oil selling puppet. Also, if she were an expert, she'd refer to is as a suppressor, it's not a silencer. Something like "The left wants to suppress your rights, I'd rather suppress an intruder."
1319 2018-10-18 21:47:50 We hear you. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years.  We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
1320 2018-10-18 21:47:48 1) I never said oil/gas receive zero subsidies, just that "renewables" are much bigger. 2) Cashing a check or a use mandate is clearly a subsidy for a given product/industry. A commonly-used accounting mechanism or price placed on a gov't asset may or may not be a subsidy.
1321 2018-10-18 21:47:44 My uncle was an F-4 mechanic. I can't change my oil.
1322 2018-10-18 21:47:30 “People everywhere pray for cake. But when God gives them flour, eggs, oil, sugar, baking powder, butter, milk, vanilla, a pan and an oven; they get frustrated and leave the kitchen.” 
1323 2018-10-18 21:47:22 I will defend pumpkin until the day I die. It's delicious & healthy specially with a dash of salt & olive oil . I don't understand the backlash. How did pumpkin become Halloween  lol 
1324 2018-10-18 21:47:17 In a state that gave such a hard time to allowing CBD oil, good luck.
1325 2018-10-18 21:47:02 Finely oil machine.
1326 2018-10-18 21:46:57 None of those "ideas guys" passed the smell test. Anyone running digital at a big brand from 90s till 10 years ago was moved sideways; we weren't dealing with the best/brightest. A 20something walks into the room & he could sell them whatever snake oil. It was all built on lies.
1327 2018-10-18 21:46:55 We gonna fuck in front of the oil paintings when Kota and I go to a museum, it’s decided
1328 2018-10-18 21:46:50 You dont know the cost of the oil in my alabaster box  #BeStillAndList
1329 2018-10-18 21:46:40 Guess I’ll be up in the morning getting an oil change 
1330 2018-10-18 21:46:32 Social security is paid for by its own tax, it doesn’t add to the deficit. So when people talk about “cutting social security to reduce the deficit,” they are talking about stealing from Americans’ retirement to pay debts for wars, oil company subsidies and tax cuts for the rich.
1331 2018-10-18 21:46:19 Becareful Oromo, we hate you more then we hate Amhara. We know why your pushing into Somali areas because of the oil found. You will be stopped dead in your tracks. The nation is unstable because of you being in power, just resign you can't unite the people with your bad history
1332 2018-10-18 21:46:14 Alaskans own 273,094 shares of ROSNEFT OIL CO PJSC, worth $1,558,157. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in RUSSIA.
1333 2018-10-18 21:46:08 There are seemingly sane people in oil Twitter who follow and cheerfully interact with the scum on the bottom of the dregs and its absurd to me.
1334 2018-10-18 21:46:00 Giiiiiiirl, I'm right there with you. x2 3' oil paintings, 100 print edition of intaglio work, 16 page booklet to design, one (1) each art history/american lit/biology research papers due in a 2wk span broke my ass and made me drop out of college. Still became a pro artist. 
1335 2018-10-18 21:45:46 Olive oil, yoghurt. Mayo not so Greek.
1336 2018-10-18 21:45:36 Now you've got me thinking about some oil infused Nanaimo Bars!  I might have to try making a small batch of those. What could be more Canadian!?
1337 2018-10-18 21:45:35 which essential oil will help me orgasm without watching hentai
1338 2018-10-18 21:45:25 I recipe uses veggie broth. And it's oil free!
1339 2018-10-18 21:45:14 In the mornings I wash my face, then toner, aloe vera gel, moisturizer, and rose water spray. And then at night I wash or exfoliate, aloe vera gel, tea tree oil, and rose water spray!

1343 2018-10-18 21:44:58 My coworker’s husband came and dropped her car off after he put air in her tires so I told him my car was hurting rn. This man took my car, put air in my tires and is now changing my oil..... A MAN! BLESS HIM
1344 2018-10-18 21:44:56 Thr r some options like kohistan dam with 2800 MW Capacity, work in progress & funds already arranged thrgh loans so need to focus such project to finish ASAP.small dams will not cost 10-12 B$ but can save huge amount which is used to import furnace oil for power plants
1345 2018-10-18 21:44:48 Tastes like palm oil noodles
1346 2018-10-18 21:44:40 Quit putting all your eggs into “oil” basket. That’s what Wall did and look where SK is now!
1347 2018-10-18 21:44:25 I got my eyebrows done, my oil changed, and hit all my lifts AND went grocery shopping before noon I also got ready before work if you know me you know I NEVER EVER get ready for work

WHO IS SHE
HER MIND 
1348 2018-10-18 21:44:13 Sir, you better find a way to replace all that oil unless you think every American would be fine with paying 10 bucks a gallon. I agree, the Saudis are not trustworthy. But there is a broader portfolio in this relationship.
1349 2018-10-18 21:44:04 Answer is resounding yes. Both gubernatorial candidates oppose measure and hardwired into Colorado culture. State still remembers/frets over oil and gas economy bust of 80s.
1350 2018-10-18 21:43:54 And I didn’t even get into how the construction industry, automobile manufacturers, and oil industry receive heavy federal subsidies that artificially deflate the true cost of driving. Add to that subsidies of emergency services to respond to automobile crashes.
1351 2018-10-18 21:43:54 I officially started up my essential oil diffuser for the fall.  May lavender and peppermint shield me from the cold germs 
1352 2018-10-18 21:43:50 I'm guessing as long as they continue to buy US weapons and help keep oil prices down they can do what ever they want can't they ? You're building the US up on blood money...
1353 2018-10-18 21:43:43 Wtf.. I pay $260 but I still get free oil change, tire rotation & state inspection
1354 2018-10-18 21:43:37 Couldn't agree with you anymore...
1. Electing trump was terrible
2. trump is a terrible person
1355 2018-10-18 21:43:17 #SaudiArabiaCrisis Once again, the Lib/Dems can see only one side of a question. Sure, we should censure the Saudis if they were complicit in the murder. But, how badly will the Dems scream when the US economy takes a massive hit after the Saudis raise Oil prices?! Gotta balance!
1356 2018-10-18 21:43:02 A fair weather resident! Went to live in the US to avoid paying tax in the UK. Came back when Thatcher repeatedly dramatically cut the top rates of tax (courtesy of oil revenues).

Threatened to go to live in the US if Brown raised the top rate above 50%!

PS I like him a lot.
1357 2018-10-18 21:42:39 I'm gonna go with mct oil because it's a pretty specific option and its more unique option then protein. Am I right?
1358 2018-10-18 21:42:33 Wealth and power have corrupted you if in fact you weren't already corrupted to the core.  You're a snake oil salesman telling American' fascist @GOP propaganda.  Good riddance to your departure from position of the LIAR of The House in Congress and one party rule in 2018
1359 2018-10-18 21:42:12 I get so nervous when they call me back when I’m getting an oil change. Idk why lol
1360 2018-10-18 21:42:10 Really? Assume for pigs. They're the only soya oil enriched feed I know of. 
Suppose more 55% PR soya meal over 40% too.
Oh and now some blaming us for palm plantations too cos livestock eat byproduct
1361 2018-10-18 21:42:01 @iainlee I think the Brexit hate on both sides is because they see the other side is heavily impacting on the other in a life changing way. As for fracking see America it wasn't good for them... The oil companies won't ever wiling go for renewables.
1362 2018-10-18 21:41:59 Oil was 33 dollars during Yaradua period, oil was less than 40 dollars sometimes in Obasanjo period. Oil was sometimes less than 70 dollars during Jonathan, 18 dollars during babangida time. Boko Haram started in 2009. Don't be a fool for this incompetence President
1363 2018-10-18 21:41:48 I just wanna say this picture was stolen from hairsay514 on instagram who makes wigs/eyebrows/beards/merkins etc for film/TV. He is also an oil painter. He is incredibly talented :-)
1364 2018-10-18 21:41:43 Pleas give some specific direction regarding how to halt #climatechange eg 1. Stop using fossil fuels (gas, coal oil petroleum and turf) 2. Stop eating meat and fish 3. Plant trees. Thank you.
1365 2018-10-18 21:41:32 Its hard to walk off the desk for sure and sucks but glad you took some - stocks are just so emotional and yes oil and gas can to but for most part not as bigger herd to compete with :)
1366 2018-10-18 21:41:30 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
1367 2018-10-18 21:41:29 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1368 2018-10-18 21:41:27 But then it would be fancy mac & cheese. lol. I prefer my pasta with tomatoes, basil, and garlic with a little olive oil these days.
1369 2018-10-18 21:41:24 my mom's first job was as a shampoo girl at a salon so that's proven useful

it's the general location of the oil gland, so if you go after that first, you're not fighting an uphill battle anymore
1370 2018-10-18 21:41:18 Adding to all the other solicitated advice here’s my 2 cents from an RN who use to work 4 Naturopathic doctors. Build immune system. It starts w/ur gut. Beta Gulcan Vitale D 20K IU w/C & fish oil. AHCC. Gargle then swallow apple cider vinegar 6-8xs daily.
1371 2018-10-18 21:41:10 May Father Asbestos and Mother Oil visit their wrath upon him

1373 2018-10-18 21:41:04 This is awesome  but what’d really be awesome if you have any oil?
1374 2018-10-18 21:40:53 Laughable that @NWCjam was digging up Jamaica for years and found no oil  but white people felt they could come dig and bingo lol
1375 2018-10-18 21:40:53 Oil on oak?
1376 2018-10-18 21:40:50 Could you keep me posted on the journey with your cat and CBD Oil
1377 2018-10-18 21:40:46 dude i be seeing this middle aged white men walking in midtown puffin their oil pens i KNOW some of them are on that blow
1378 2018-10-18 21:40:37 the US also imports over 1m barrels of oil  / day from the UAE...

but I do think the weapons sales are more important
 to the current US regime.
Jets cost way less when you build a surplus, and sell a bunch off.
1379 2018-10-18 21:40:34 a wise man once said that when 45 tries to formulate a clear sentence, a member of congress whispers #covfefe
1380 2018-10-18 21:40:32 We hear you. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years.  We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
1381 2018-10-18 21:40:27 見回り行ってきまーす！
1382 2018-10-18 21:40:22 Also when they're cooked and you've strained them add some sort of oil to them to keep them from sticking to each other too much (olive oil also tastes pretty decent added to them)
1383 2018-10-18 21:40:17 Yeah, it was kinda painful, but I do feel nice and bendy and relaxed now that my retinas have returned to normal after the peppermint oil burn
1384 2018-10-18 21:40:15 Oil does come in handy when you want to drive to work though
1385 2018-10-18 21:40:09 ああ、これ？スポーツブラ。油の貯蔵庫が垂れちゃうからね。

1387 2018-10-18 21:40:02 MBS runs Saudi Kingdom since the King is suffering from Alzhimers.

Everyone sucking on the oil turned to green teat are afraid of the financial repercussions.

Don't worry, the king has plenty of crown princes to choose from.
Battle for the Kingdom behind the scene continues.
1388 2018-10-18 21:39:55 We hear you. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years.  We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
1389 2018-10-18 21:39:52 Rogue killers, Trump defending a horrific act done by Saudi Arabia, which is only distinguishable from the terrorist group ISIS because it's a country with a lot of oil. Otherwise they both hold no value for life or humanity. We should do NO business with them.
1390 2018-10-18 21:39:43 He is the continuation of Fallin. Another oil puppet to do his overlords’ business, keep taxes low, and keep #oklaed underfunded and third rate. #GPT7orGTFO
1391 2018-10-18 21:39:43 Until it was pointed out I didn’t even think of that....too use to land with no oil and no water!
1392 2018-10-18 21:39:42 Y’all be careful at the oil spill tonight
1393 2018-10-18 21:39:35 Palm oil mixed with Gnut oil
1394 2018-10-18 21:39:31 From Iran

Trump want: Oil
Israel: Muslim Heritage, Land (already they got Kurdistan, Syria)
Saudi, UAE: Dominance 

Aftermath: Trump n Israel will push KSA, Qatar to take Refugees, not towards them

1400 2018-10-18 21:38:31 Nothing this violent and drastic happens in the Saudi Kingdom without the royal family’s knowledge or consent.  This is a corrupted autocracy floated by oil revenues. Saudi Arabia is NOT a modern, moderate or democratic state.  This is not a joke or drill.

1407 2018-10-18 21:38:01 I remember that very clearly. The glass wasnt anymore clear after 3rn57 bumped into it though. It had an oil mark where his forehead hit.
1408 2018-10-18 21:37:57 I’m superstitious. I’d advise against going hard after the Saudis before the Midterms. Spike in oil prices and bad events where we have Troops deployed. Being a little superstitious and having humility isn’t a bad idea here.
1409 2018-10-18 21:37:51 Took in our recycling, did laundry, went to Walmart for important stuff, got an oil change and went and got a car wash and vacuumed out the car. Productive. Now I need a damn nap.

1415 2018-10-18 21:37:10 Yes, and because of that, we have troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan as a result. Today, I think we have less dependence on the Saudis for oil, but their contribution is still enough to cause a recession.
1416 2018-10-18 21:36:58 A reinvigorating facial mask, neon blue, with concord grape, olive oil, and exfoliating moisture spheres. It smells musky and flowery.

1418 2018-10-18 21:36:40 It feels good having new tires, a oil change, and an alignment ..... and of course it’s feels great bying off time going and getting your pups goodies at the Petco right across the street while waiting on the work to be done but thanks Tateboys in Catoosa 
1419 2018-10-18 21:36:35 If so, our dependence on oil limits our country from being a free people. 

Green technology should be a national security priority.
1420 2018-10-18 21:36:34 It's nice not leaking oil or having a rattly exhaust! Also, I'm excited for working AC. Haven't had that for 2 summers....

WHY did i think putting some coconut oil in it would stop it from flipping all over the place after being tied up when all it did was make it look SO MUCH WORSE and also GROSS
1426 2018-10-18 21:35:22 Yes they say they will listen to what THE PEOPLE have to say. Not oil & gas companies. Not chambers of commerce.
1427 2018-10-18 21:35:14 Pmb borrowed, and I have seen an uncountable infrastructures. While, in 16y of PDP, the barrel of oil is $120, when the country has no any problem of insecurity. So, where is the 6tr that has been borrowed?

1440 2018-10-18 21:33:41 Where was the outrage when Saudi Arabia was not put on the list by Trump if countries who were banned from entering United States. This was because of oil and money, business over terrorists
1441 2018-10-18 21:33:30 Saudis oil running out, so they set their eyes on Yemen. America wants to maintain the petrodollar, so we're OK with it.

1444 2018-10-18 21:33:09 @realDonaldTrump
Mr. President, you shouldn't threaten Saudi Arabia. We need their oil. These "consequences" will lead to increased gas prices and civil unrest on the home front.
1445 2018-10-18 21:33:04 Don't forget she has gone to the Midde East to have sex with rich Arabs oil men.  She literally have sex with people who hate Americans in general, and she talks about dignity , it comical coming from her

Electric lamps were 10x what oil lamps were. They were cleaner and burned much brighter for longer periods of time. They also had a much lower fire risk. However, technological improvements like this came at a price of electricity, which was costly at the time.

1481 2018-10-18 21:30:17 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
1482 2018-10-18 21:30:10 was replying to your second tweet ; it’s not all oil, water, pepper etc 
1483 2018-10-18 21:29:51 Gavin encapsulates the problem elegantly. There is nowhere for Brexit to go from here. May doesn’t want no deal because it is political and economic suicide. But there is no other bespoke “deal” to be had. There has never been a plan. Reality time for the snake oil peddlers.
1484 2018-10-18 21:29:48 This is part of why I voted for him. The impact of the statement for me is that he is not dependent on oil corporations or insurance companies. He doesn't think about making them happy when voting. 

Even then, he just raised $781,977 from individuals, while Kim raised $665,327.
1485 2018-10-18 21:29:47 Every oil block allocated to an individual or group of people needs to be returned to the Nigerian people, what’s your principal take on this?
1486 2018-10-18 21:29:34 @sullivanradio maybe this had to do with all the workers that came in during the oil boom.
1487 2018-10-18 21:29:31 given the huge downturn in oil in 2014, it would be prudent to look at the people including Kenney who didn’t get it done when oil was triple digits and the investment climate was more conducive, instead of believing he will get it done now.
1488 2018-10-18 21:29:28 Does your ex husband eat salad oil and tell you he works two jobs and he cannot afford alimony for people who live where he does now t drive
1489 2018-10-18 21:29:27 Thanks, Jenni! I got it changed for me, but I have to sit down and read it because my car burns oil quick and I'll have to fill it up myself every once in a while. 
1490 2018-10-18 21:29:12 Just stepping in here. Not disagreeing. Oil prices were higher 5 years ago than they are now but petrol wasn’t anywhere near as expensive . How can that make sense ? :S
1491 2018-10-18 21:29:03 @senatemajldr You truly are one of the most foul, deceptive, obfuscating power mongers our country has to offer. Your zeal to kill the ACA will harm us all. History will remember you as a snake oil salesman who cared not one whit for his own constituents.
1492 2018-10-18 21:29:03 But Trump has distanced himself after initially making idol threats by saying the killers were rogue Saudis ! And the prince is still my mate ! But I like his oil more 
1493 2018-10-18 21:29:00 ... Oh She knows you know we know ..... but cogs and wheels need oil on the midnight oceans
1494 2018-10-18 21:28:51 For this Atiku will renew your oil block if he becomes President. Clap for yourself well calculated.
1495 2018-10-18 21:28:44 Watching Sweeney Todd and confused as to why slide some oil to me is stuck in my head as I hum the songs lol
1496 2018-10-18 21:28:35 Giving this Jamaican Castor Oil 2 weeks
1497 2018-10-18 21:28:30 It probably means that like every previous administration they will try to ignore all the wrongdoings to avoid $130 a barrel oil /$7 per gallon gas
1498 2018-10-18 21:28:29 not only oil, money, power but also development as Iran wants too but in less megalomaniac way. Iran think in terms of partition the others in terms of possession or competition or superiority as chosen people in Israël

1526 2018-10-18 21:26:19 @realDonaldTrump you can talk all you like about consequences to Saudi Arabia but you’ll do zero ...you’d never disrupt the biggest oil producer to the USA. How about you focus on you’re own backyard and control gun situation and amend you’re 2nd amendment #bigmouthtrump
1527 2018-10-18 21:26:10 Olive oil is a great choice too. 

There might be calls to eat less dairy but eating margarine is not an enviro choice. It’s a manufactured food so energy intensive to produce, it comes in plastic tubs, most (not all) still contains dairy, and it often contains palm oil too.
1528 2018-10-18 21:26:10 "I got free oil changes and tire rotations" lmfaooooo
1529 2018-10-18 21:26:02 Right, I was thinking of the regions with fairly minor reductions that some are claiming as evidence of a decoupling effect between emissions and GDP, but I'm not convinced. My main point is that there is no painless solution -- and no solution that leaves oil companies unscathed
1530 2018-10-18 21:25:58 Do you get oil and gas for free?
1531 2018-10-18 21:25:53 LOL none will show any interest until Ukog continually produces a high flow of oil. The bigger reserves surround the Falklands and the Falklands is British.
1532 2018-10-18 21:25:39 - vases full of olive oil, the golden liquid now spilling onto the stone, seeping into cracks and slicking the bottom of people's sandals. The noble women had already lifted the very bottom of their robes to avoid the oil from ruining their garments.

1533 2018-10-18 21:25:37 I wonder why we keep rebuilding when just we use the water from all of these storms make lakes  power plants, Just like oil tunnels or send it to the west coast. We could save or money. I believe we could save so much money, start and the world would follow you
1534 2018-10-18 21:25:35 Oil, gas and coal are naturally self-sustaining, and will be for centuries to come. 3 Trillion barrels just under Colorado. Fracking will make #FossilFuels cheaper and over-abundant in the coming decades. At 13+c per Kwh, wind and solar will never be viable on the open market.
1535 2018-10-18 21:25:35 Canada is right next door. Lots of oil.
1536 2018-10-18 21:25:31 Question for these mightier than thou Dems. When they suggest canceling arms deal w/ Saudi’s over Khashoggi murder they should also be asked whether they would also call for cutting off all oil purchases from them as well and take the blame for resultant increase in gas prices.
1537 2018-10-18 21:25:29 Great point Greg. Lefties losing their minds about the Saudis while doing everything to keep us dependent on Saudi oil. #TheFive
1538 2018-10-18 21:25:15 The relationship between us and the Saudis isn’t important because of oil.. we have enough to sustain us and then some. What’s important is they’re fighting TERRORISM! And the globalists would love to sever this relationship to empower the terrorists after POTUS destroyed them.

1554 2018-10-18 21:23:01 If you want a bit of the history re Saudi Arabia and why it has been such an important parter of The West then you need to go back to a deal done by Roosevelt and the then leader Abdul Aziz who agreed an oil deal in exchange of ensuring the Saudi’s retain their faith at the time.
1555 2018-10-18 21:22:59 @KennedyNation I could help with heating oil issue.. I believe I have an idea that would aliminate home heating.... contact me and I'll explain how and my idea

1576 2018-10-18 21:21:25 Palm oil as foundation...joy! 
1577 2018-10-18 21:21:25 A friend has a 160-acre farm in E Kentucky with 21 oil/gas wells. Enough NG for free heat including a greenhouse, but not enough to run a large generator.

1579 2018-10-18 21:21:12 “The Lord said to Samuel, “How long will you grieve over Saul, seeing I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and go; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided for myself a king among his sons.””
1 Samuel 16:1 RSV. Zim case
1580 2018-10-18 21:21:06 In the #Khashoggi affair, the issue is not whether the US "cares for human rights". It is that our government cannot be beholden to a gang of criminals (the House of #Saud) just because they have oil and money. Americans are proud people, not the butlers of rich despots.
1581 2018-10-18 21:20:56 I tried getting Xo out by taking Castor oil TWICE but nothing happened so I bought an exercise ball today and spent two hours walking around target. Lets hope that does something.
1582 2018-10-18 21:20:55 Like water on an oil fire
1583 2018-10-18 21:20:51 Really enjoyed it Priya! Except for @YogaPadHenley making me do the scissors of doom and try to bend my back inside out and stand on my head 'n' shiz. Also she had a cold and misjudged the amount of oil at the end and it temporarily blinded me. But I liked the lying down part. 
1584 2018-10-18 21:20:51 He did, and he probably did so to help Saudi Arabia. It helps Saudi Arabai in two ways. It raises the price of oil due to Iran's oil distribution being restricted and it makes it more likely for Iran to get a nuke, which will lead to the Saudis creating their own nukes as well.
1585 2018-10-18 21:20:48 If you do not think #plastic
leeches/bleeds, store some dry coffee in a ziploc for a few weeks/months. The coffee oil leeches, and there are probably plastic molecules attached. Plastic is a petroleum product. Petroleum is a carcinogen.
(idk, i just h8 plastic)
1586 2018-10-18 21:20:46 There poisoning our cows and stealing our oil What next

1590 2018-10-18 21:20:36 Did u try olive oil?
1591 2018-10-18 21:20:33 I absolutely truly believe more research and funding should be given to the whole topic of Cannabis Oil
1592 2018-10-18 21:20:24 i’m getting my oil changed and the man told me to pop my hood .... i just looked at him ... i deadass forgot how to even do that. every day i find new reasons why my bachelors degree doesn’t really mean much
1593 2018-10-18 21:20:23 Games for fun with family or friends (and luring away from solitary screen time); Jackbox Partypacks, Snake Oil, Anomia, even Molerats in Space!
1594 2018-10-18 21:20:08 I know & I keep hearing more good things about cannabis oil. I heard on the talk today that it helps put some cancers in remission. Ricky Lake did a documentary about it.They won't say cure but oncologist don't say that unless you have been in remission for at least 5 years.
1595 2018-10-18 21:20:05 So would the U.S., but ............ OIL.
1596 2018-10-18 21:19:56 Are you then flying to Canada Oil Capital beautiful Calgary

And Nicolas is correct, truffle oil must die.
1603 2018-10-18 21:18:53 If this guy at Honda doesn’t stop hitting on me and just change my fucking oil ima lose my shit 
1604 2018-10-18 21:18:50 My oilbularyo friend gave me her formulated essential oil for focus and stress away. Nakakawala ng stress. 
1605 2018-10-18 21:18:35 We can buy oil from someone else, but we should move away from fossil fuels anyways.

The arms sales dont create many jobs to begin with. Besides, selling weapons to Saudi Arabia is like selling weapons to Iran or ISIS.
1606 2018-10-18 21:18:31 Shut yo.. . You don’t have insider info but I do agree it will crash dramatically. It doesn’t take insider info or a genius to know this... it’s only a matter of time. ( and no it’s not because of oil )
1607 2018-10-18 21:18:29 Only in Zimbabwe, maybe that's why God didn't bless us with the real oil? This scares me so much, can't imagine the nation going back to 2008 the height of Mugabe and zanu madness
1608 2018-10-18 21:18:14 Tomorrow I'm definitely doing a hot oil treatment with deep conditioning. It's brick outside.
1609 2018-10-18 21:18:11 I’m so glad I held out  getting the box just for that! And the ouai hair/body oil xxx
1610 2018-10-18 21:17:49 It’s not a conspiracy idiot, the Saudi’s already said that they would jack up oil prices to nearly $200 a barrel. It’s global economics dip shit. #FuckingTroll
1611 2018-10-18 21:17:49 Not a damn thing, but I think Trump does not want his legacy tainted by the oil embargoes of the 1970s—that and his fortune.
1612 2018-10-18 21:17:47 Resources are finite. Applying them in the most efficient and effective manner is important if you want the most favorable outcome. Misplacing or squandering them helps no one. Asking hard questions provides viable solutions. Ignoring reality doesn't
1613 2018-10-18 21:17:30 Please challenge their use of 'entitlements' as we've paid for Social Security & Medicare: they are benefits. On the other hand, the oil industry gets entitlements, welfare that should be rescinded.
1614 2018-10-18 21:17:26 Too bad for Erdogan that Turkey is an oil importer.

*MBS will likely survive and the Saudis will not forget Turk's role in this fiasco.
1615 2018-10-18 21:17:20 Eastern Canada will still imports billions of dollars worth of Saudi Oil.  They don’t care about a journalist.  Now if it was an elephant, or a giraffe, you might see some outrage, but for a human being, I’m guessing nothing.
1616 2018-10-18 21:17:20 Right I got that. And oil has been rising for 12 months. So it's neither a surprise nor odd.
1617 2018-10-18 21:16:54 This "well-oiled machine" is leaking like an oil well fire.

1619 2018-10-18 21:16:35 The reason Nylander is asking for stupid money is because Chia doesn't know how to evaluate a players worth. He gave a player too much money because of who he played with. Dubas doesn't want to make the same mistake. So we are talking about the stupid contract signing by the Oil
1620 2018-10-18 21:16:35 USDCAD stopped out on tumbling oil ahead of busy Canada data day and next week's rate hike. New Premium update goes out tomorrow.
1621 2018-10-18 21:16:19 oh yeah ive heard about tea tree oil! i just bought a body wash with it bc my arms/back breakout bad :( glad to hear first hand that it does work!
1622 2018-10-18 21:16:10 Heard it was a 100 gallon oil tank leaking in the basement
1623 2018-10-18 21:16:10 @(goat) Jamie maybe tell about your oil ?
1624 2018-10-18 21:16:01 Then do the eggs a favor put 老干妈 sauce by @Laoganmausa ...trust me, you'll be singing the praises of black bean in chili oil sauce. Come to think of it. Laoganma would be appropriate for you. The founder is an old Chinese lady revered in China the way some Americans do you.
1625 2018-10-18 21:15:49 We have enjoying oil money. The moment this tax thing kicks in fully, we won’t be taking a lot of the things we are getting from Govt.
1626 2018-10-18 21:15:41 I had a lumbar fusion on my lower back when I was 30, an injury from working on an oil rig. I was home for 6 months recovering, and after the first 6 weeks when I could kind of walk again I ended up spending most of my days playing World of Warcraft on my laptop
1627 2018-10-18 21:15:36 OIL
1628 2018-10-18 21:15:35 Throw the bastards out before we must explain to our kids that we let the planet EARTH die because oil made money for some very rich old men.

1633 2018-10-18 21:15:03 Instead of US buying Saudi Oil, why not use our own? Saudi's make $$ on US. NO amount of money is worth a human life. Only 1 Party EVER puts money over humanity. #EnoughIsEnough #VoteBlueToSaveDemocracy #ImpeachTrump and GOP co-conspirators. #WhatContract

1635 2018-10-18 21:15:00 I  see a bunch of stuff about loan guarantees & some about tariffs (or lack thereof). We're not big fans of loan guarantees by gov't in general, but hard to peg them as specifically oil & gas subsidy.
1636 2018-10-18 21:14:56 I think we need to stop the villification of oil and gas companies.  They have to change ASAP, but they have to be given  money and expertise to do so.Don't it harder than it has to be.
1637 2018-10-18 21:14:48 Bae  my face is secreting oil I’m so gross rn
1638 2018-10-18 21:14:46 To the gold diggers digging today, hope u find oil
1639 2018-10-18 21:14:42 Social security is paid for by its own tax, it doesn’t add to the deficit. So when people talk about “cutting social security to reduce the deficit,” they are talking about stealing from Americans’ retirement to pay debts for wars, oil company subsidies and tax cuts for the rich.
1640 2018-10-18 21:14:28 For the greed of power & OIL (Obsessed Islamist/Israeli Looters?) so many blood of ppl have to sink into the soil.
1641 2018-10-18 21:14:22 "I read a tweet that said I need to get oil change so here I am"
1642 2018-10-18 21:14:20 Sorry, my campaign "CBD oil" violates GoFundMe terms and conditions bc it's considered an illegal drug or derivative.  Okay, time to play the Mega Millions.

1644 2018-10-18 21:13:56 1) countries with highest ghg emissions per capita are either oil countries or highly liberalized ones
2) countries with lowest per capita ghg emissions tend to be less liberalized
3) China is certainly an environmental leader, despite most of its economy being planned
1645 2018-10-18 21:13:43 If you work for Oil Co. & travel to Saudi for a job, you must sign a WAIVER you will not sue Oil Co. if if they chop of your head or your hands.  Still to this day, the waivers are signed.  The sanction must be: THIS MUST STOP.  No more body parts chopping off.  @POTUS #FoxNews
1646 2018-10-18 21:13:39 So Ancient Greeks carried around little clay jars of perfumed oil for "deodorant", cleaning themselves, etc.

However school is trying to push narrative that these were used solely for analyst lubricant (Greeks are like so gay amirite)

Is there evidence or is this just bullshit
1647 2018-10-18 21:13:39 Because in reality they know they'll get away with it in the long term.

It'll be business as usual by the New Year.

Jet fighters to sell, oil to buy, geopolitics to play.
1648 2018-10-18 21:13:28 I’m a cetaphil oil control wash and vitamin c creme and that’s it kinda gal. I need to get on your level, I want to look young forever. Is there any one product you think is NEEDED to try out of all you use? I’d like to add on slowly.
1649 2018-10-18 21:13:06 I think @ariannahuff said once that best thing US citizens could ever do for this country would be to get off dependence on oil.   Some of the most radical mosques in the world are in Saudia Arabia ... and they are a very repressive government that we should not support.
1650 2018-10-18 21:13:02 We should be using Canadian oil in Canada before importing oil.
1651 2018-10-18 21:12:57 Imagine the headline: police shoot cooking oil consumers

Seriously though

1656 2018-10-18 21:12:26 Proof please. How many jobs were lost via ndp led government in Alberta? What I've seen is an expansion in oil related jobs and other jobs created in alternative energy sectors. Ive seen more promotion of small businesses under the NDP. Better healthcare and education.

1666 2018-10-18 21:11:40 I just scheduled my oil change
1667 2018-10-18 21:11:36 Lols but not as before cos our so called dependent on oil is not as before cos other areas are bringing more IGR than before.

1670 2018-10-18 21:11:24 I think you misinterpret my views. I have great compassion for others, but at the same time I realize there are limits to our ability to mitigate circumstances of others. Asking the question of what these limits are, not unreasonable. It's necessary.
1671 2018-10-18 21:11:22 Mr. President, in one of your rallies you said "we are now the biggest producer of energy including oil production". Why then are we still paying $3 a gallon at the pump? Shouldn't we be at around $1 since it's now "home grown"? #MAGA #TRUMPISMYPRESIDENT

1687 2018-10-18 21:09:51 I do not use them.  Most of the men's faciial products have a witches brew of weird chemicals and additives that sound nasty.  I use emu oil mixed with essential oils if I have dryness issues, and wash my face with EO All in One Soap before shaving.
1688 2018-10-18 21:09:46 Drink some oil and eat some coal. They LOVE YOU

1690 2018-10-18 21:09:23 Saying the M.C. of XRP means anything is like asking what the M.C. of Oil is. Its irrelevant. We pay for the utility of oil compared against its available for USE supply, we don’t pay for what’s in the ground. Just like sell orders of XRP on an exchange for an Xrapid transaction.
1691 2018-10-18 21:09:23 Nope. Gross. 

Try melted butter for the veg oil, dash of salt and a 1/2 tsp of vanilla - makes it amazing.
1692 2018-10-18 21:09:21 China also stopped buying US oil.
1693 2018-10-18 21:09:20 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
1694 2018-10-18 21:09:10 oil or acrylic paint
1695 2018-10-18 21:08:48 i live in an oil town in texas. there are so many white supremacists and homophobic people out here that actually pose a threat. out here i’ve never seen an angry or dangerous democrat. just my observation
1696 2018-10-18 21:08:44 Yep, and penne's mine. Still love doing penne with broccolini aglio e olio e pepperonicio, deglazed with a good dry sherry, and tossed with more good olive oil and pecorino.
1697 2018-10-18 21:08:29 I've only got olive or walnut oil. So I've just found a recipe using apple sauce - I've got compote - same, same - right? I'll drink more wine . . .
1698 2018-10-18 21:08:27 Ok this is a tough one. We LOVE @Rostizado_yeg's churros in an unhealthy way and we are a bit obsessed with @JACEKChocolate's seasonal menu. We would highly recommend dinner at @UCCELLINOyeg and ending the meal with the olive oil cake - it's so simple yet so delightful.

1704 2018-10-18 21:07:32 Dont you thinks it's more ideal situation for them. MBS is a monster, in making. And they like to invade bad guys to deliver democracy, specially if they have oil.

1708 2018-10-18 21:07:24 Yes!
1709 2018-10-18 21:07:14 WTI crude continued its descent below $70. The commodity fell -$1.12 (-1.61%) today to $68.83. Brent oil also slipped and closed at $79.31
1710 2018-10-18 21:07:14 The combination of coconut oil and lavender oil is amazing
1711 2018-10-18 21:07:09 I love spoiling myself, lighting some candles, put a mask, moisten my hair with my favorite oil, relax, and enjoy the moment.
1712 2018-10-18 21:07:07 My ex-boss has a building named after him at OU. I really want a building named after me at OSU. Guess I either need to strike it rich in oil and gas or just go ahead and win the lottery!
1713 2018-10-18 21:06:49 They could still frack on federal land, also those “projections” put out by big oil are questionable to say the least

1717 2018-10-18 21:06:33 Goddamn snake oil scam-artists.
1718 2018-10-18 21:06:28 It doesn't matter how "responsible" citizens are. The "police" have made it, abundantly, clear, they are going to continue to harass and arrest people smoking marijuana, regardless of the "laws".  Arizona still considers CBD oil a Felony possession.
1719 2018-10-18 21:06:21 Daddy, the pee pee master is in it for cash only. Our border with Mexico is not horrible. Could it be improved. Yes. Are there hundreds of thousands of rapists and killers crossing, no not hardly. Cowboys hate snake oil salesmen!  And that’s the best he is. Amateur
1720 2018-10-18 21:06:15 Well thats fine to not support the Saudi's but until Trump we were dependent on them for Oil now that their grip on that revenue has loosened we have more latitude!
1721 2018-10-18 21:05:49 Came for an oil change & ended up needing new brake pads. 

I hate adulting 
1722 2018-10-18 21:05:40 Weakling-in-Chief won’t stand up to Saudis. Doesn’t want to upset guns for oil deal.
1723 2018-10-18 21:05:32 "In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents." - Make Gen Butler.

U$ is an empire
1724 2018-10-18 21:05:30 Have you seen the Calgary unemployment rate lately? Did you not know about the dozen multi-national oil companies with HQ's in Calgary who closed up shop to open in a different country after the carbon tax & cap was imposed? What more evidence do you need?
1725 2018-10-18 21:05:15 Of course I can believe it.  This is an awful and delicate situation.  They invest 110B in, they have a 75yr alliance and they are where we get our oil, especially after imposing sanctions on Iran.
1726 2018-10-18 21:05:11 She just wants Venezuela oil! She is doesn’t care about Venezuelans or human rights! Imagine a caravan of Venezuelans would walk to US border! They would be greeted like Hondurans!!!

1729 2018-10-18 21:04:54 Saudi Arabia is not a friend to the US. 15 of the 9/11 hijackers. Atrocious human rights records, killing thousands in Yemen and now Kashoggi. We don’t need their oil. We don’t need their brand of hate. We need to stand up & choose right over wrong. Denounce them & cut them off.
1730 2018-10-18 21:04:53 "I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall St."

1732 2018-10-18 21:04:45 First oil change for the whip. Thought it was gonna be more expensive considering what I would pay to derive the Benz. Happy it’s less lol
1733 2018-10-18 21:04:41 The current Saudi situation will drive oil prices up-Venezuela has the largest oil reserves(more than the saudis)under a genocide narco-state financing terrorism w Iran/Turkey and BEGGING for international intervention-is it an option?Let Saudis-Turkey deal w their own
1734 2018-10-18 21:04:23 No . Not directly related . KSA wanna sell oil to China and its very viable through Pakistan route
1735 2018-10-18 21:04:23 I’m an Oil Producer. Ain’t no way!
1736 2018-10-18 21:04:22 Because they have a little oil on the bottom.
1737 2018-10-18 21:04:21 Always remember Saudi Arabia had 15 of their citizens hijack our planes and fly into the World Trade Center. Why are we letting them off the hook? We don't need them for oil we are self reliant there, so who's pockets are they lining?
1738 2018-10-18 21:04:12 This is your occasional reminder to spot-test cosmetics, especially fragrances even if you’re like me and have no known allergies. 

Guess what? I certainly got a very itchy rash from a new perfume oil I just slathered everywhere, don’t be me.
1739 2018-10-18 21:04:05 One of those things u can't take away from...
Yam and palm oil
1740 2018-10-18 21:03:48 Again, then and now.  The Khashoggi murder undercuts any pretense of social modernization, it is a problem for House Saud, not for the West. Oil may not be the"weapon" it was, it will be less so over time. We'll see what happens, so respectfully Sir i think we're done here.

1752 2018-10-18 21:02:01 Sir....if big oil/gas companies didn't spend so much time lobbying for DECADES to stifle research & development of more environmental friendly energy sources we wouldn't be here. Climate change is real & its way past time we start taking care of it. I voted yes.

1778 2018-10-18 21:00:12 Also glossed over by climate scientists and media alike is the implication that IF it’s fact THEN oil companies must disappear ASAP.
1779 2018-10-18 21:00:03 Jim Bowie Davy Crockett and William Travis must feel like fools. Their heroism has been betrayed and nullified by an invasion which has no opposition.

1784 2018-10-18 20:59:48 Not a fan of snake oil salesman. I wasn't a fan of Billy nor Franklin Graham either. These guys never got on the political level and they really need to stay out of it!
1785 2018-10-18 20:59:48 3. Coconut Oil
Coconut oil is largely made up of saturated fats with a high amount of fatty acids. To be precise, a good percentage of fatty acids found in coconut oil are lauric and capric acids. These acids are actually great at protecting your skin from infections.
1786 2018-10-18 20:59:46  OIL IT! OIL IT UP! 
1787 2018-10-18 20:59:32 You are a snake oil salesman - truly despicable
1788 2018-10-18 20:59:26 They can get away with that stuff because the Western economy is tied to their oil, specifically the US dollar.  I've also heard horror stories of what Ethiopian refugees go through there.  The Keffil system is modern day slavery and they can snatch ur business/home at any time!

1798 2018-10-18 20:58:10 "Iraq is demanding the return of $17billion (£10.5billion) in oil money it says was stolen by U.S. institutions in the wake of the 2003 invasion.

In a letter to sent the UN sent last month the Iraqi parliament asked for help finding and recovering the money, which disappeared"
1799 2018-10-18 20:58:07 Absolutely rubbish & BS. We have never heard him doing sting operation earlier. He has been caught red handed blackmailing a police officer. This is another example of honey & olive oil in wine bottle.
1800 2018-10-18 20:58:01 Did you know:
- That when oil prices halved in 2014/2015 that international gas prices halved too.
- That NZ retail gas prices didn’t go down AT ALL

1803 2018-10-18 20:57:39 Simple video showing a car parts seller wrapping a bottle of oil in bubble wrap and carfully packing parts away in a box.

Obviously some twat has to be on their high horse complaining on the use of plastic.

Listen dickhead. Do you want your parcel leaking oil?
1804 2018-10-18 20:57:37 Hi, I am happy to follow your opinion regarding the development of oil price. What is your opinion regarding the Brent oil price till the end of this month? Do you believe that the oil price will still go down? If yes, where will the bottom be? Many thanks :)
1805 2018-10-18 20:57:24 @benshapiro how’s it feel to justify an absolute warlord? YOUR tyrant is aiding and abetting oil shiks and murdering journalists.

1806 2018-10-18 20:57:23 I’ve been out of CBD oil and I’m honestly so proud of myself for fighting through my anxiety and kicking fucking ass the past few days
1807 2018-10-18 20:57:19 First cars rolled off the line 100+ years ago. Gas/oil r still top corporate welfare. Renewables need decades of subsidies to catch up. I thank Obama, past Govs & legislators for this. Everyday I look out my window & c those windmills, I say a big FU to KSA & whole Middle East.
1808 2018-10-18 20:57:17 The design, creation and maintenance of these systems will or should require less and less human labor to maintain a consistent growth of productivity and efficiency to be competative across the econ landscape.

1809 2018-10-18 20:57:10 I saw the Republicans use kids in wheel chairs to make the case to legalize cannabis oil. It took listening to the experts and seeing the proof that it wasn’t wise to pass it. All this emotional banter is from tve greatest liar there is.
1810 2018-10-18 20:57:07 But to answer your question, the cbd oil has been found to help with anxiety and seizures. even conservative old bama is moving to approve it for seizures.
1811 2018-10-18 20:57:04 China and Russia have moved off the US dollar when dealing with OIL. Mmmm interesting
1812 2018-10-18 20:57:02 Just think of all the electricity being saved. Oil refineries have their own substation they use so much power. No need to power petrol pumps. The list goes on. No need to fear the change. Drive one. You'll love it
1813 2018-10-18 20:56:57 Hey all.  Looking forward to tonight.  Great things are happening and someone will be the lucky winner of a free bottle of CBD oil.

1817 2018-10-18 20:56:40 Good points. Bahrain definitely needs the money while kuwait has much more breathing space esp with current oil prices. leverage from financing providers Saudi Arabia and UAE who already implemented likely deciding factor. Why shouldn’t Bahrainis pay VAT if their nationals are?

1821 2018-10-18 20:56:26 In fact, countries in North Africa like Libya and Algeria will probably start exporting solar energy to Europe. The desert is perfect for solar energy. It’ll probably end up being cheaper to produce electricity with solar than oil in Saudi Arabia. The future of the ME is bright

1825 2018-10-18 20:55:44 I’ll use olive oil. One ingredient.

 No animal abuse. Healthier too. 

The IPCC report recommends reducing dairy consumption in order to prevent irreversible climate change. How come you are promoting eating more?
1826 2018-10-18 20:55:43 US sold our soul to the devil for Saudi Arabian oil.  Should have listened to Jimmy Carter and continued to reduce dependence. Guess we couldn't make it without international oil companies getting filthy rich and destroying the environment, though.
1827 2018-10-18 20:55:41 Love a good conspiracy theory. Oh look it’s by the Heartland Institute again and 7 years old. You need to find articles from someone other than oil and gas funded organisations.
1828 2018-10-18 20:55:36 Spoil yourself and burn some trees, take a shower, apply baby oil on, play some lekka music and sleep. You deserve it.

1836 2018-10-18 20:54:06 . . .  and, like our relations with this country, it is linked to oil. . . .  the term 'unctuous' comes from the act of smearing or anointing. and one of its definition is 'fatty, oily'

1839 2018-10-18 20:53:44 Oil at $100-120, fiscal deficit at 4%, current account deficit at 4%, Indian government bond yield at 9%, Indian ruppee at 100 against the dollar. Bhai main toh yeh sab assumptions le raha hun. #Nifty50
1840 2018-10-18 20:53:43 Except for the glaring fact that the US doesn’t need KSA oil anymore (heard of fracking Caitlin?)

Once again @caitoz proves how out of touch she is with the modern world.
1841 2018-10-18 20:53:21 Pot Update: As of 8am, there have been 9,980 orders placed. 805 were processed at the BCCS store in Kamloops. The BC Liquor Distribution Branch says sales have slowed a bit and most online shortages are in the dried flower 1 gram quantity as well as oil capsules. @NEWS1130
1842 2018-10-18 20:53:13 Gal try the new head and shoulders with argan oil, I use it and it’s amazing 
1843 2018-10-18 20:53:13 Que saudades do Oil Rogue
1844 2018-10-18 20:53:07 That is why Oromo is penetrating Somali regions, they want to claim it cuz they know about the oil/gas. We will never allow it, the oromo squatter will be pushed back into his territories. He wants to do the dire scam again on somali, settle among somalis and claim % on oil
1845 2018-10-18 20:53:05 The Jamal Kashoggi - Saudi Arabia case is a stain on the diplomatic world. The arrogance of this regime with their human rights abuses thinking they could get away with murder. The world is watching to see how countries react to the oil giant when investigations are completed.
1846 2018-10-18 20:53:04 Slyly deserved, how you burning oil bruv
1847 2018-10-18 20:52:44 Oil dey your head 
1848 2018-10-18 20:52:34 Check your DM sir
1849 2018-10-18 20:52:34 Ironically, the shift towards renewable energy and away from fossil fuels will probably mean peace and prosperity for the Middle East. Even though countries will lose oil revenue, it will lose its value as a strategic resource and so western powers won’t be fighting for it.
1850 2018-10-18 20:52:03 Delegado alemão questiona o posicionamento da delegada Iraquiana em relação ao projeto oil for food.
1851 2018-10-18 20:51:58 I need oil
1852 2018-10-18 20:51:53 I used to get my oil changed there. There are enough weed stores in the area. Not happy about that one.
1853 2018-10-18 20:51:53 edibles, maybe, not concentrates. Making edibles means buying oil.
1854 2018-10-18 20:51:53 It's all about that unctuous oil.
1855 2018-10-18 20:51:46 Admittedly it’s enormous, but it’s all relative. 
What about oil companies, tech companies etc....
1856 2018-10-18 20:51:43 In advanced countries, there is a main gas line you get hooked up to if you build a house. In Nigeria you buy your own gas cylinder. No idea of cylinder maintenance. No idea about quality of the gas. Massive fire hazard in every home. Major oil and gas exporter.
1857 2018-10-18 20:51:40 And everyone that is up in arms, rightfully so, will run to fill up their tanks and millions of other things that support the oil.
1858 2018-10-18 20:51:39 The media is turning you all against Russia because the US is in a proxy war against them in the middle east. The war is for oil and Russia made a peaceful deal with Syria. The US is trying to get the oil through war and regime change.
1859 2018-10-18 20:51:32 Venezuela has the largest oil reserves (more than the saudis)under a genocide narco-state financing terrorism w Iran/Turkey and is BEGGING for international intervention 
1860 2018-10-18 20:51:25 Hi Cam. I thought it was going to be another bleh day. So far, my week has been pretty bleh. I burned lemon oil and I  felt so much better. 
Good night honey. Sweet dreams
1861 2018-10-18 20:51:05 If I move back to Houston we need to form a Wells Fargo dream team of the oil and gas industry lol
1862 2018-10-18 20:51:02 Your time is over, all the oil/gas is in Somali regions. You will be suffocated, as Somalis will ensure they collect the vast majority for it's region. Maybe they will throw you a few pennies 4 Amhara to keep your ass down from seeking power. When that oil comes out, game changes
1863 2018-10-18 20:50:59 I'm a provide for my seed I'm the soil. I teach em bout loyalty.
I teach em that his skin black like, oil that's for royalty. I show 'em all the things that my pops was neva showin me !! 
1864 2018-10-18 20:50:58 Lovely , OIL falls again 
1865 2018-10-18 20:50:53 He tried to justify it by saying the routine service is included. Nigga my oil change is $50 and I drive German lmao
1866 2018-10-18 20:50:52 @foxandfriends @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs @marklevinshow @chuckwoolery Activist journalist to put it mildly! MEMBER OF MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, HATED WESTERN COUTURE/DETESTED FACT THAT SAUDI KING WANTED TO EXPAND WESTERN INTERESTS BEYOND OIL!
1867 2018-10-18 20:50:51 So... you’re ignorant hypocrites? That’s ok, hun. Y’all will fit right in on the left. They’re hiring! GOP of past 20 yrs: 9/11, Bush’s War for Oil, fake WMDs, Patriot Act, #losing & overall shitting on the Constitution. Trump’s GOP: #MakingAmericaGreat #Winning #Patriotic so GFY
1868 2018-10-18 20:50:48 A lot of the arguments for the use of cannabis oil is based on pure emotion which is a means to get people to emphasize with you. But cannabis is the gateway to legalizing marijuana. Colorado is a mess
1869 2018-10-18 20:50:45 Having to sneeze while oil pulling is a truly singular experience I hope to never relive #coconutoil #diygonewrong
1870 2018-10-18 20:50:35 Nigga said free oil change and tire rotation as if that justifies anything lol
1871 2018-10-18 20:50:34 anyone have recommendations for sulfate free shampoo that doesn't have coconut oil?
1872 2018-10-18 20:50:34 Come on then les explain... Where's the riches coming from... Don't say oil, worst E and P since 70s
1873 2018-10-18 20:50:27 somebody take my shit to get an oil change pls thnx
1874 2018-10-18 20:50:21 They are, and it’s psychotic. They claim to fight terrorism but only destabilize and support extremists. They use terrorism as a justification to intervene and control strategic resources. They prop up puppet regimes to control the world’s oil supply.
1875 2018-10-18 20:50:16 I gotta get the oil in my car changed after work  I just wanna go home and practice league
1876 2018-10-18 20:50:12 So I’m going to roast it, make a brown sugar/garlic chili paste/oil drizzle, chop up some fresh herbs, crumble the feta. Omg. It’s going to be so good. It’s not even 2pm and I’m ready for dinner.
1877 2018-10-18 20:50:12 Wish I knew how to change my own oil. I'd save so much money.
1878 2018-10-18 20:50:04 So its not about oil then?
1879 2018-10-18 20:50:04 deeping bread in a mixture of oil, Maggi n pepper topped it with cold water
1880 2018-10-18 20:50:00 OIL CHANGE IN PROGRESS
1881 2018-10-18 20:49:59 Try tea tree oil
1882 2018-10-18 20:49:53 Look at NY times article on the Saudi king's inner circle.  You'd hack a friend who was alive into pieces? What kind of barbarians are you? North America leads the pack in oil resources and production; this is not 1970s rationing- so shove it Saudis.
1883 2018-10-18 20:49:48 Buying oil here
1884 2018-10-18 20:49:48 Pa još gore ako ste to mislili jer njegovi “uspesi” u ekonomiji SAD će tek da se vide, naročito ako se pogleda ukupni deficit i spoljno-trgovinski deficit, a da ne pričam koliko nas košta podrška coal+oil industriji u vidu klimatskih promena. I tržište nekretninama je usporilo.
1885 2018-10-18 20:49:27 most people don't know that because cars were invented in the late 1800s you can substitute peanut oil for regular engine oil.
1886 2018-10-18 20:49:25 Ameen Thumma Ameen 
1887 2018-10-18 20:49:18 War in Yemen is worst humanitarian crisis in world atm, butchering of Khashoggi, countless acts of barbarism + holding world to ransom with threats of oil price hikes to shut us up, yes they should withdraw. @RafaelNadal & @DjokerNole have power to send King Salman a message.

1890 2018-10-18 20:48:50 Girl oil change 
1891 2018-10-18 20:48:50 Really? Trump added sanctions within the first 6 months of his presidency. He pushed NATO to increase funding to defend against Russia, he pushed EU nations away from being dependent on Russian oil/natural gas, and he authorized strikes that killed 300 Russian troops in Syria.
1892 2018-10-18 20:48:44 Boss karfin haline kawai
1893 2018-10-18 20:48:44 I think every president has had their hands in some dirty shit, probably comes with the job sadly, but when shit comes to light, it's how you act then that makes the difference. The Saudi's are so blatantly guilty here it's basically comedic. But of course, you need their oil.
1894 2018-10-18 20:48:36 And I'm fairly sure I read that China bought zero oil from us in September,  that will help the countries like Russia, right?
1895 2018-10-18 20:48:34 Venezuela is producing a lot less oil these days tbf
1896 2018-10-18 20:48:34 That long relationship came about because of US thirst for oil: how much of geopolitics derives from that thirst is not usually considered.

A balanced Mid-East policy was attempted but tilted on that pivot, and we are paying the price throughout the region!
1897 2018-10-18 20:48:33 What's wrong with pursuing green energy? Oil and coal are finite, outdated, and bad for the environment.
1898 2018-10-18 20:48:32 I slow cook it with skin on one thigh, a ton of garlic and a ton of chili garlic sauce. The rendering fat creates a chili garlic oil. Then I slow simmer in broth until it is fall off the bone and garlic is poached and serve over rice noodles.
1899 2018-10-18 20:48:29 #USA #prepares for ($200) #Two #Hundred #barrel of #Oil #Saudi @realDonaldTrump
1900 2018-10-18 20:48:29 I suppose it was sold at gas stations. "Fill my tank and my zippo lighter, change the oil and clean my windshield"
1901 2018-10-18 20:48:28 I’ll be interested in what you think. When they legalized cannabis oil I. Georgia, I was against it. I went to hearings and heard doctors and law enforcement talk about the dangers of it. One DA pleaded with the committee to stop it. They didn’t.
1902 2018-10-18 20:48:18 It's because they have huge sums of money and have their hands on the oil spigots.
1903 2018-10-18 20:48:14 couldn't agree more + copious amounts of extra virgin olive oil
1904 2018-10-18 20:48:07 Govt support should also be extended to soya beans and sunflower for local production of cooking oil, thereby saving on forex being used to import crude cooking oil.
1905 2018-10-18 20:48:06 A mans really out here forgetting to apply cocoa butter/oil to my hands before going out in this cold. :///
1906 2018-10-18 20:48:05 Salt & oil a match made in heaven & hell
1907 2018-10-18 20:48:04 More like griddled crevettes with truffle oil and lemon foam lol
1908 2018-10-18 20:47:49 @CapeCodChips I love your chips but I’m sad to see that you’ve started using safflower and sunflower oil instead of canola oil! Why!?????
1909 2018-10-18 20:47:49 Thieves, peppermint oil, Lysol and taking daily vitamins is the best way to go!
1910 2018-10-18 20:47:45 They sell in main land China which requires animal testing by law so they’re not cruelty free really. And I agree with the palm oil comment!
1911 2018-10-18 20:47:40 My mom poured coconut oil all over my head ohmygod

Oil of OLAY.

1915 2018-10-18 20:47:26 Maybe Trump should be saying: “It sounds like he’s dead!” Regrettably realpolitik will see minions sacrificed and the Bosses protected. All in the interest of arms sales and oil. Civil society is a far distant dream still.

1918 2018-10-18 20:47:03 @realDonaldTrump The American people are not stupid. At least some of us aren't. We know it was Saudi that killed Jamal.  Now we entrusted you with our lives. Screw them people we have oil in reserve. Do what needs to be done. We can not be pushed around .
1919 2018-10-18 20:47:02 I wish I could abandon oil, but can't afford to at the moment. Our system incentivizes oil for a reason. As for the WWE, it is vital that US-based companies send the Saudis a message that their human rights abuses - especially when US residents are at issue - won't be rewarded.
1920 2018-10-18 20:46:56 I know, I stand in defense of no one.but me.
People just think oil shortages slow traffic.
It actually runs the Globe.
Since there is plastic...in everything. (saddly, Oceans are dying from it).
1921 2018-10-18 20:46:51 The roots of 9/11 came from two terrible bargains. One was between the Saudi ruling family and the kingdom’s religious establishment, where each blessed the other. The other was America’s cynical bargain with the Saudis (cheap oil & Israel)
1922 2018-10-18 20:46:43 @MaxBoot, I agree we shouldn't sacrifice our morals for arms sales. To me, it's more about global oil supplies than arms. I would add that this situation underlines importance of pursuing policies to produce what we need here at home so we can afford to cut off bad actors.
1923 2018-10-18 20:46:25 Street is filled with feral screaming teenagers.

1927 2018-10-18 20:45:59 Trump would give you up in a heartbeat if it meant money. He's a snake oil salesman and you suckers fell for it.

1931 2018-10-18 20:45:51 D) EFTA without EEA would allow trade with multiple countries, primarily in South America and Asia but also Canada.

E) EFTA plus Britain would be a stronger trading group and would align finance and oil exports with Norway and Switzerland and fishing with Iceland.

1932 2018-10-18 20:45:51 Has tea tree oil honestly done any good for your skin?
1933 2018-10-18 20:45:47 I have a feeling MbS will be just fine. They'll find a scapegoat, behead him/them and Kushner will get his wish: it all blows over, cheap oil and $$$ flows into Trump's businesses ... Jamal Khashoggi becomes another sad footnote in the ongoing barbarism of that society.
1934 2018-10-18 20:45:44 You can put some castor oil on that to stop that burning sensation...
1935 2018-10-18 20:45:31 Their rich, powerful, oil&gas donors would get upset if they believed in climate change. The upper class thinks they will somehow buy themselves out of the unpleasantries of global warming.
1936 2018-10-18 20:45:27 Could you please stop using palm oil as well? Palm oil is a disaster for the environment and animals
1937 2018-10-18 20:45:25 Yeah there not. First oil change I did on my car took it or dealership, said “it’s free with a tire rotation” 
1938 2018-10-18 20:45:23 I’m aware of the price of oil but yooo I’m literally fighting with my mom to turn my heat on... My house is 55°
1939 2018-10-18 20:45:19 Today I took the time to •thoroughly• clean my floors, so yes, today is also the day my sons will adopt worms (mud and all) as indoor pets, spill a cup (a CUP!!) of hot coconut oil, and decorate the floor with glue and crayon. #itsfine #boymom #sendwine
1940 2018-10-18 20:45:11 Kenneth Haapala, member of the Heartland Institute. Receives funding from the oil companies, tobacco companies, pharmaceutical companies. Not very independent #FakeNews
1941 2018-10-18 20:45:09 why does my car start tweakin when I turn on the AC. like I know I need an oil change and more coolant but it needs to pipe down and get it together
1942 2018-10-18 20:45:07 Does he even have a policy on oil?
1943 2018-10-18 20:44:50 “Saudi investigators determined he committed suicide by dismembering himself, and happen to offer to buy a few more military jets, drop oil prices by a buck, and gild the Trump toilets in gold.”
1944 2018-10-18 20:44:22 I’m so impatient when it comes to waiting for an oil change 
1945 2018-10-18 20:44:16 Has anyone tried CBD oil? 
I’m thinking about trying it for my anxiety but I haven’t heard much on it

1947 2018-10-18 20:44:05 Allow me to channel @DrJenGunter in saying “Don’t spray cannabis oil on your genitals either.”
1948 2018-10-18 20:43:47 @juliemason bottom line there's no way we will jeopardize a strategic Alliance and potentially start and oil crisis because of Saudi Arabia's contempt for human rights. What's called for is the obligatory words of disapproval and Toothless sanctions.
1949 2018-10-18 20:43:47 The world leaders need to stand together against this regime and they will gain respect globally, just get past the dollar  sign, another way would be to find less use for oil
1950 2018-10-18 20:43:45 It's later than we think. The ocean is rising, right now. #congress fiddles, farts around while this is happening.  The POTUS calls a woman "horseface" and protects the oil bidness.... ???????
1951 2018-10-18 20:43:43 I'm sorry, were you going to provide some detailed facts on the alleged subsidies being given to oil/gas/and traditional energy sources (when compared to so-called "renewables" or are we back to the name-calling and diversion?
1952 2018-10-18 20:43:43 Always found it odd why it's called vegetable oil if it's made from seeds. I'll stick to fruit oils like olive and coconut thanks.
1953 2018-10-18 20:43:38 @HughCoyne can’t leave out my  #lionsmane mushroom powder & @bpnutrition Braine octane #MCT oil daily coffee combined with time restricted feeding and ketosis... a year into it & is starting to get the cognitive benefits particularly during high stress working shifts!
1954 2018-10-18 20:43:36 Yesssss! Fish oil!!! Omega -3. Very important. And there's an amount of Eda or something you need in it. I forget...
1955 2018-10-18 20:43:31 I love Tofurkey. I make one glazed with olive oil and Montreal chicken rub with fresh veggies and Stovetop stuffing with can-shaped cranberry jelly.

I have that all week then go to a restaurant with my family a week later. Travel is hell then and we don’t eat the same things.

1959 2018-10-18 20:42:41 When the NTV News is running the current prices from the markets, oil, gold, etc they should run the current price of cannabis.
1960 2018-10-18 20:42:40 1. Sesame oil
Sesame oil contains protein and and antioxidant compound called sesamol. It can help unclog pores. Soak cotton balls in sesame oil and apply to your skin. Leave it on for about 20 minutes and wash it off with a mild cleanser! You can also leave it overnight!
1961 2018-10-18 20:42:38 Mom: lol I got CBD oil for my diffuser

1962 2018-10-18 20:42:31 ima wait til tomorrow get an oil change so danasia could come ride with me
1963 2018-10-18 20:42:30 you really ought to change your name to "shills for stakeholders in the oil & gas industry" since the last thing you are to science is "friends"
1964 2018-10-18 20:42:23 Deep coal miners and oil rig hands should earn the same wage as receptionists, clerks and waitresses..  or maybe Truck drivers same as bus drivers?  The wage gap stuff has always been a lie.  You are correct

1969 2018-10-18 20:42:04 Rosehip oil.
1970 2018-10-18 20:41:54 I don’t agree with that. They just did better with what they had, and have a high tax/high support system. We pissed all our oil money up the wall, and sold everything that wasn’t nailed down.
1971 2018-10-18 20:41:46 As long as the Saudi Arabians honour their agreement with the US to trade oil in US dollars, the US can keep on creating new dollars without the risk of inflation. A good reason to stay friends, I guess.
1972 2018-10-18 20:41:41 .

2111 2018-10-18 20:27:05 Lmao drink olive oil pls dear
2112 2018-10-18 20:26:56 see as you want to  cast yourself....  was referring to the anointing oil
2113 2018-10-18 20:26:53 Thanks. I checked and was able to order my oil. Now all I have to worry about is a postal strike.
2114 2018-10-18 20:26:50 Mostly a risk off trading session in several risk asset classes. Oil,NG,most AGs,metals(except gold) and equities. USD higher @DTNOilandGas @DtnTrading
2115 2018-10-18 20:26:48 Given the extreme lack of transparency over South Sudan’s oil revenues and fiscal spending, Norway is best placed to help with the operational control over oil management and systems to disclose oil revenues in real time.
2116 2018-10-18 20:26:44 Rubbing alcohol, water, peppermint oil. Spray it in your shoes every night. It’s how I keep Mike’s shoes fresher lol
2117 2018-10-18 20:26:37 Everything involving the Saudis has been swept under the rug forever. Oil talks.
2118 2018-10-18 20:26:36 Before a young woman’s turn came to go in to King Xerxes, she had to complete twelve months of beauty treatments prescribed for the women, six months with oil of myrrh and six with perfumes and cosmetics. (Esther 2:12)
2119 2018-10-18 20:26:26 Ending our dependence on oil saves the planet from both Global Warming and Jihad. Get on it @realDonaldTrump
2120 2018-10-18 20:26:25 Getting my oil changed & some new brakes tomar 
2121 2018-10-18 20:26:17 It’s all about that oil. Plus he a business guy so of course that what he push for. Not for the people but business
2122 2018-10-18 20:26:12 Is this meant to be reassuring in some way? This do-nothing, "they will investigate," "don't forget, they have oil" kind of position? I thought your America was supposed to be about strength. Your fans must find this spinless behavior very, very disappointing.

2124 2018-10-18 20:26:09 Thanks lovely! I've been using the simply oil balancing one which seems to have been working but the last couple of weeks my skin has been extra oily and I don't know why  maybe I'll give that one a go! 
2125 2018-10-18 20:26:01 No entiendo algo, ypf compro las estaciones de oil, muy rapido. Como no pueden vender C5N y pagarles a los empleados. Si tiene buena audiencia...
2126 2018-10-18 20:26:00 I'd suggest adding some kalongi oil to it.. astonishing relief! 1 tspn of kalongi oil for every three tspn of honey.

2128 2018-10-18 20:25:42 Its the ripple effect of our money and crude oil stolen under his boss GEJ. He's enjoying his share of it abroad and vomiting nonsense here.
2129 2018-10-18 20:25:39 The chubby ones we're seeing here ,where do they come from?
2130 2018-10-18 20:25:22 As horrific as this is, every American administration for decades has coddled the House of Saud. They’re medieval tyrants with Rolexes. Innocent people in SA are detained, tortured, mutilated and horrifically executed all the time. But oil and money and Iran makes us “allies.”
2131 2018-10-18 20:25:20 We’re going to continue to decrease our Saudi Oil dependence by increasing our American oil energy production here in the US. Problem solved.
2132 2018-10-18 20:25:11 @lakewoodford_wa It's saying something when I've had better oil change experiences at Walmart than I did today with you. #JustSayin #oilchange #badexperiences
2133 2018-10-18 20:25:06 Spice up your chicken with this tasty marinade recipe:
1. Mix 2 cups of Hoisin Sauce with 1/2 cup of Panda Brand Soy Sauce
2. Top it off with 1/4 cup of Pure Sesame Oil
2134 2018-10-18 20:25:01 Oil is fungible. Creating a market for oil helps the Saudis, period.

Entertainment is NOT a necessity.  So why make removal of a non-necessity, that the Saudi PAY FOR, as a punishment?

You are just reacting, instead of thinking things thru. Saudis are supporting WWE, not Vi-ver
2135 2018-10-18 20:24:56 Hmmm, Canadian oil might look good to USA soon...NAFTA, USMCA might need to be revised.
2136 2018-10-18 20:24:52 OiL Prices will Quadruple $00N
2137 2018-10-18 20:24:41 You are absolutely right ! 
Western countries learders of 
The free world should support 
Their values in ME ppl need
It human rights and rights and 
Freedoms but they aren't they support bloody dictators 
Cheap oil & billions aren't 
More expensive than humen lifes
2138 2018-10-18 20:24:32 Those savages has nothing to give to the world but violence and oil
2139 2018-10-18 20:24:00 I think it's a bit easier with reapers cause it's a natural heat.

if you do it with other sauces, it's usually juiced up with capsaicin extract oil, which isn't as delicious.
2140 2018-10-18 20:23:56 Severe consequences?..Not likely.. They're the number one producer.. They can embargo oil for YEARS of they wanted to.. 
They can force the U.S. the ramp up refineries to handle shale and drive up prices for years in the mean time.. So? Not likely!
2141 2018-10-18 20:23:53 But to each his own r u gunna be working in the oil industry
2142 2018-10-18 20:23:46 Idk I know 0 about religion
2143 2018-10-18 20:23:29 Normally coat it in olive oil and then season it with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and a little crushed red pepper. Off the chain. You can do it with whatever seasonings you enjoy though.
2144 2018-10-18 20:22:49 thank u. i heard tea tree oil would be too harsh for a piercing as new as mine?
2145 2018-10-18 20:22:49 my pants literally always look like i dumped a cup of oil on my right new thx aquaphor
2146 2018-10-18 20:22:31 Is it the monkey femur? Cause I tried using it on the oil pool quite a few times but all that was said is that he didn't know how to use those two objects together. Was ready to rip my hair out ahaha.
2147 2018-10-18 20:22:15 Definitely!! 

I pulled onto a petrol station earlier today only last week petrol was £1.25 today £1.34 the price of a barrel of oil had been stable for months. 

With food the contents of meats and fruit is shrinking also confectionery too like bars of chocolate.

2150 2018-10-18 20:21:06 Brutal Civil War Is Probable In Saudi Arabia Disrupting Oil Supplies & TRUMPONOMICS Is Looking Systemic.
2151 2018-10-18 20:20:45 So evidently CBD oil cures every ailment ever known to mankind.  Hey, great if it does, but I don't believe it cures everything people claim it does.  Sounds like propaganda from the pro-pot crowd to me.  But I hope I'm wrong!  I'm certainly no expert!
2152 2018-10-18 20:20:45 so long as they're not cooking it in veg oil
2153 2018-10-18 20:20:45 I dey laugh these girls when them say Davido and wizkid get oil blocs. I choke that day ehn. Like me wey be Nigerian sef just dey hear that lamba for the first time. That means one Nigerian don dey use am chop them
2154 2018-10-18 20:20:44 Bolton and Kelly are at each other's throats. Were I a betting man, should their argument devolve into pugilistics, my money would be on General Kelly. Just another indication overturning Trump's contention that the WH runs like a well oiled machine. The machine needs oil.
2155 2018-10-18 20:20:43 I think NATO is bullshit. And I haven't seen any of that. The only reason woman make less is usually because Herndon put in the hours men do. Overtime. They take off to have kids. Also they don't do jobs as dangerous like working on oil rigs on the ocean.
2156 2018-10-18 20:20:42 Hah. One big perk of living in Texas: access to local farm-to-market beef. And the cherry tomatoes have been especially good this year. Makes a nice complement with your olive oil.
2157 2018-10-18 20:20:35 @CNNSitRoom /is it not a crime to hide evidence or information of a Murder. TRUMP IS a criminal. If the Senate let TRUMP get away with  withholding information to a murder for money and oil from the Saudi's King the world should take note America is a country that kills for money
2158 2018-10-18 20:20:33 @realDonaldTrump 

Here we go again, just because Saudi Arabia thinks about oil the price goes up!
FACT. United States has over 3 Trillion Barrels waiting to be taken, and that is more then the entire world has!
US needs to get that oil, build at least 50 new oil refineries!
2159 2018-10-18 20:20:18 tried making some kale chips and i accidentally put in too much garlic salt and olive oil haha..;;; 

still kinda good tho, i'll have to actually follow the recipe next time :D
2160 2018-10-18 20:20:07 Can't beat a turkey deep fried in peanut oil.
2161 2018-10-18 20:20:04 My road has oil too apart from the 4 bungalows of which I'm one so luckily I'm not stuck with that, I have all electric only. I imagine it costs fortunes to get proper services to rural areas. I certainly wouldn't have relocated here, given my time again in hindsight
2162 2018-10-18 20:20:02 Snake oil....
2163 2018-10-18 20:20:01 John Elway was able to be bought with oil money to spread their propaganda. #YesOn112
2164 2018-10-18 20:19:53 They try to scare us with loss of money as if that can scare us more than the families and friends we've lost in accidents due to big oil and their lack of responsibility...thank you @MarkRuffalo!!!
2165 2018-10-18 20:19:51 Congrats! Charlton Wimberly appointed Associate General Counsel at Marathon Oil Corporation
2166 2018-10-18 20:19:46 How about we continue producing our own oil and gas and support American workers!  Produce, produce, produce!!!
2167 2018-10-18 20:19:40 real man panic buy hacksaws grinders and drill bits

2168 2018-10-18 20:19:38 First of all, he wasn't American, he was a US resident.

Second, we are still HUGE consumers of their gas and oil, and they have invested in a lot of American companies.

I AGREE diplomacy from the US Govt is necessary to assert Western values. What does @WWE have to do with it?
2169 2018-10-18 20:19:32 First amendment does not mean being criminal which you are and you spiritual “leader” Pat Robertson is. You people sell your mother for oil and money. You really hate them but want their money.
2170 2018-10-18 20:19:26 millions of jobs will be lost if oil companies face any impediments whatsoever
2171 2018-10-18 20:19:25 Somehow the spam Cannabis Oil emails are getting past the Gmail filters, I’m getting several a day. It’s the boner medicine spam of the late 20teens I guess.
2172 2018-10-18 20:19:24 Producing & processing bitumen emits more ghgs than conventional oil. If oil from bitumen is replaced by conventional oil, there will be a net benefit.
2173 2018-10-18 20:19:20 Google pixel 3’s usage of transcription to take down telemarketer scams & snake oil sales people is something I really enjoy. It’s honestly awesome.
2174 2018-10-18 20:19:15 It happens on all piercings, it’s a sign of the surrounding tissue becoming inflamed by trauma and trying to heal it’s self too quickly. Use tea tree oil
2175 2018-10-18 20:19:13 BB8 private eye. ‘It was just another stinking day trying to keep this damn galaxy from ripping itself apart, I was enjoying a glass of single malt oil when BB9 walked through my door. I said ‘beep bop beep?’ (Translated as what’s a droid like you doing in a place like this?)
2176 2018-10-18 20:18:59 みんながそうやって炒められて揚げられて…ねぇ、誰のおかげ?誰のおかげかな?

2177 2018-10-18 20:18:52 I'm getting my oil changed and in the lobby Dr. Phil is on..and the topic is white privilege...it's like 8 ppl in here ...5 white 3 black...and they keep looking at each other ..shit funny lol
2178 2018-10-18 20:18:49 You have been praying  for that so you don't loose your source of oil hahahaha

2181 2018-10-18 20:17:51 Y'all should consider investing in oil. Especially if shit goes pear-shaped. #ThursdayThoughts
2182 2018-10-18 20:17:50 リゼロ観ようと思ったけど半年したらAT-Xで放送するだろうからスルー
2183 2018-10-18 20:17:46 If we are the largest producer of oil why can't we get gasoline prices down?
2184 2018-10-18 20:17:35 It's time to say no to Bibi too... he has the same kill for oil, kill to steal the land that you want from those who own it. It's time to change our foreign policy and to restructure our alliance with countries that have common morals/ethics/dreams for a better world.
2185 2018-10-18 20:17:31 Would like to see more discounts or free gifts for frequent buyers.. like local dispensaries do. Love the oil/flowers and speedy shipping 
2186 2018-10-18 20:17:29 Hi Jo! Unfortunately, we won't bring the Vanilla Perfume Oil this Christmas. Don't worry, all the inquires are always forwarded to the relevant department and, hopefully, we'll decide to bring it back in the future as a part of discontinued favorites! :)
2187 2018-10-18 20:16:49 When will he embrace the oil and gas companys that he is support to embrace.

2191 2018-10-18 20:16:38 Part of a new oil painting  It started from the photo. Now color added from on down the road. Painting in progress
2192 2018-10-18 20:16:34 I use motor oil. 10W30 in the summer and 10W40 in the winter. Shots of antifreeze to keep the interior moving.
2193 2018-10-18 20:16:25 Because it’s not in the interest of the big US and multinational oil companies that own our oil...
2194 2018-10-18 20:16:21 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, and residing in our country with dignity.
2195 2018-10-18 20:16:21 For all of you know it all talking about the Southern Utes have you been there?  Do you know any of them?  They have worked very hard and are now one of the wealthiest tribes in America. They take great care in their extraction of oil and gas. Their water & land is clean. STFU.
2196 2018-10-18 20:16:18 Olive oil in the mixture too.
2197 2018-10-18 20:16:17 There's this commercial in VA about the pros of underground pipelines that misses the mark: it's not that we want the least intrusive way to transport oil, it's that we want to move away from its dependence
2198 2018-10-18 20:16:11 Men's shaving oil is great too. Doesn't clog up the blades like the foaming gel does.
2199 2018-10-18 20:16:06 lamp oil, rop.e . bombs?
2200 2018-10-18 20:16:02 All oil in the villages near us. What's frustrating is I bet the Highlands have some special arrangement and get it faster than us, and we're only in Oxfordshire! Hardly the back of beyond. And they're working on increasing already super speeding net vs rural gets left behind
2201 2018-10-18 20:15:56 Ok so tea tree oil isn’t good for my skin because it’s burning my face
2202 2018-10-18 20:15:56 Tea Tree Oil really does it all
2203 2018-10-18 20:15:54 @kasie @msnbc can’t believe how ignorant Trumpsters in Montana are -to say that Trump is bringing people together speaks 2 the woman’s lack of information.Stunned by the blatant bias, showmanship, FOX, lies, and snake oil of racism that blinds Trump’s base.Disappointed in America
2204 2018-10-18 20:15:47 Hopefully you can get subscrided some medicinal canabis soon it helps the oil
2205 2018-10-18 20:15:45 I JUST WANT MY FUCKING OIL CHANGED JESUS FUCK.
2206 2018-10-18 20:15:42 This makes no sense, so was it a road traffic accident? A fight? An oil spill? Or all 3?  do you even know what you were reporting @bristolLive #sloppyreporting
2207 2018-10-18 20:15:38 We're getting an oil change rn. Maybe tomorrow!
2208 2018-10-18 20:15:37 Here are some things I just can’t deal with anymore: 
- white sugar
- too much gluten 
- sunflower oil
2209 2018-10-18 20:15:35 10/19:映像学科のやつ見に行く
2210 2018-10-18 20:15:28 No offense to George Webb, but he is not POTUS. What matters most is what POTUS says. And POTUS is saying that he does not want to offend Saudis over arms, oil and jobs.
2211 2018-10-18 20:15:28 Sounds good the minister has failed the economy part of this equation. Amarjeet has not met with oil+gas leaders. He doesn't have pipeline company support with bill C69, he is a phoney dropped in by Trudeau, hoping that liberal can secure one Alberta seat next election.
2212 2018-10-18 20:15:24 Oh my god, Tavie. I wish I could unknow it. It's made with actual truffle shavings, not that nasty fake oil. AND IT IS OUTSTANDING.
2213 2018-10-18 20:15:20 Pero la verdad es q debería haber caído ayer tenía q corregir si o si antes de segunda vuelta y además con el oil ayer cayendo la mantuvieron demasiado, no sería raro verla mañana 14.80 y el lunes x ahí mas abajo, para mí anda el número x ahí para volver a entrar hasta el viernes
2214 2018-10-18 20:15:18 Yes - especially since Trump and the @GOP have gone out of their way to curb development and implementation of alternative energy. This is what keep the US so reliant on oil. But calling them out keeps the nation tippy-toeing around the facts and wanting to be nuanced.
2215 2018-10-18 20:15:14 @walmart in Stillwater thought it was a good idea to put 2 wires into the oil filter of @Kamber_LeBlanc car, manager said they didn’t do anything wrong when the car was messing up afterwards, dealership mechanic thought differently
2216 2018-10-18 20:15:09 Dude I use to use proactive and the coconut oil worked better and faster.
2217 2018-10-18 20:14:42 ขอบคุณงับบพี่ออย
2218 2018-10-18 20:14:42 Use aloe, shea butter and coconut oil, or just #coconutoil, your you keep the chemicals found in skin stuff like shampoo, deoderant, think about it, your not the best, but you can get better, sharpen both sides of your sword, the visual and mental, look into dmso, shh
2219 2018-10-18 20:14:37 If you tax oil, government gets money, companies sell less oil, no additional revenue and production surplus is exported, so no actual emissions reductions on global basis.

 If you limit supply, oil companies raise price and compensate for lower production with higher prices.
2220 2018-10-18 20:14:24 My ex did this for me in oil and I loved it! I was only 18 thou .. I quit the spam when we broke up heartbreaking prob saved my arteries thou.
2221 2018-10-18 20:14:23 the bleach always dried it out, bleach actually not only kills but thickens your hair so if you ever bleache your hair starts at the ends of your hair because your scalp is the warmest so there for it will work quicker there 
bleach also itches alot 
also use coconut oil
2222 2018-10-18 20:14:22 That's a decent fuel, based on the original diesel fuel, peanut oil. It does generate byproducts of CO2, and other carbon byproducts, but generates less output than fossil fuel, in exchange for more deposits in your engine.
2223 2018-10-18 20:14:21 Queuing for oil
2224 2018-10-18 20:14:19 The hopeless robot used the oil heater as the wheel and felt robbed about the conclusion.
2225 2018-10-18 20:14:13 This oil I purchased from my new oil guy from school is BOMB!
2226 2018-10-18 20:13:58 i just use coconut oil
2227 2018-10-18 20:13:48 Lightly scented. I make mine with real cucumber oil and so it's a gentle cucumber scent
2228 2018-10-18 20:13:39 Didn't Obama open up drilling in Atlantic? What happened w/the Canadian Oil Sands pipeline? What about Qatari Gas? We have so many alternatives but we want to favor certain people who are rich & powerful today but maybe not tomorrow like Coal Mine owners!
2229 2018-10-18 20:13:37 ... in late 2014 -15 our reserve mysteriously depleted and then crude oil price followed it. America said they have #Shale and the the ban on a particular country was lifted.

Only if we knew how close we were to becoming really poor as a nation.
2230 2018-10-18 20:13:31 Yet... where it is right now, I would not necessarily advise against a long oil trade... soon.
2231 2018-10-18 20:13:26 Have you tried CBD oil?!
2232 2018-10-18 20:13:22 Use coconut oil
2233 2018-10-18 20:13:13 Odiiwo anzi isa ndikupe cooking oil 
2234 2018-10-18 20:13:09 Omg I got beauty supplements the GNC prime rose oil and others. Can’t wait to see what it does.
2235 2018-10-18 20:12:53 Juninho of course, but 2000s children will argue with me 
2236 2018-10-18 20:12:51 Iceland stopping the usage of palm oil in all their home brand foods is amazing !! Other supermarkets should follow in their footsteps and do the same !!
2237 2018-10-18 20:12:50 I guess its not too popular to tell the truth when you've:
-supported #TrumpCare & #ACA repeal
-supported renewed off-shore oil drilling along our beautiful coastline
-reject Climate Science
-reject gun safety reform

2238 2018-10-18 20:12:43 Trump has made America worldwide the top in oil, natural gas and coalAny economy with the world’s number one oil producing industry, number one natural gas producing industry, and number one coal producing industry is going to be leading the world with booming economic growth.
2239 2018-10-18 20:12:38 Best thing for American and for Middle East peace would be if price of their oil kept dropping and Saudi became as poor as Yemen
2240 2018-10-18 20:12:15 @jaketapper Asdhole says end relations with our oil supplier and you sit there like a toad on a rock.
2241 2018-10-18 20:12:11 you’re right, my bad. but surgical wait times will also be affected by kenney’s health care hack & slash. the NDP sure isn’t perfect but they’re a heck of a lot better than the guys that got us into this oil bust mess to begin with.
2242 2018-10-18 20:12:10 The Saudis are not our friends. They needed US military protection, US needed their oil. Saudis are butchers, 9/11 by them. Read Bob Grahams extensive research.

2248 2018-10-18 20:11:45 We do not need to shoot ourselves in the foot. If China or India wants our gas or oil sell it - fund our costs to convert to a green economy. If we do not sell to them they purchase elsewhere.
Reduce our use - supply reductions do nothing.

2250 2018-10-18 20:11:34 So you honestly believe that the near half of the Scottish population who want independence will change their mind because another Labour snake oil salesman is in No 10. The indy cat is out of the bag and its not getting back in.
2251 2018-10-18 20:11:21 Eileen people like you thrive in the error of fakenews. The more of it out there, in any field, the more fools will start to trust people like you rather than educated, trained experts.

You're a disgraceful snake oil selling scaremongerer.
2252 2018-10-18 20:11:19 Of the stocks I follow, the only ones positive are tobacco, oil refiners, auto parts retailers.  I don't know what that means, but there you go anyway.
2253 2018-10-18 20:10:48 Africa has oil. China needs oil. The US & China are in the beginning stages of a trade war. They have been heavily investing in energy there. Then boom, China started importing more oil from West Africa than before this fall.
2254 2018-10-18 20:10:48 Closest thing to a moisturizer I've had on my face is motor oil. Not on purpose.
2255 2018-10-18 20:10:38 For PDP to tag any other govt. corrupt, it should account for the about 1T dollar income from oil that accrued to Nigeria & all the dead State owned enterprises: Oku-Iboku & Iwopin Paper Mills, Osogbo, Jos & Katsina Steel Rolling Mills, Aluminium Smelter Plants btw 1999-2015.

2260 2018-10-18 20:10:15 For years we've all heard stories of rtd military officers involved in illegal oil bunkering now it's all coming out little by little....
2261 2018-10-18 20:10:14 Drunk on oil money and US coddling.
2262 2018-10-18 20:10:13 Social security is paid for by its own tax, it doesn’t add to the deficit. So when people talk about “cutting social security to reduce the deficit,” they are talking about stealing from Americans’ retirement to pay debts for wars, oil company subsidies and tax cuts for the rich.
2263 2018-10-18 20:10:11 We roam ahead and turn out of where you see
I can’t hear the heart, this old oil stain

2265 2018-10-18 20:10:03 Geeeze, #Colorado !!   Stand up to big oil, fire your reps if they won't stand up right beside you and kick ass with you.  Own it and then fix it.  Your state is your state, not their production field.

2268 2018-10-18 20:09:47 it's not considered a skill. Neither is sewing, knitting, the ability to pick a lock (I got trapped inside my apartment, no joke! Busted cylinder), change the oil or tire on a car, or any basic camping skills. It's embarrassing.

2272 2018-10-18 20:09:16 Snake oil I say!
2273 2018-10-18 20:09:15 In class they never specified to us the special diet we have to eat when exploring, producing, refining and/or selling oil..
I wanna know what these special chefs cook
2274 2018-10-18 20:09:14 I am capitalism and my anatomy is the anatomy of a monster, I breathe fire, I consume oil, I tinker with your pretty brains.
2275 2018-10-18 20:09:11 Let me get my ass up & go get my oil changed . 
2276 2018-10-18 20:09:08 Siesta, fish, wine, vegetables, olive oil, pork and a little bit of everything with  a smile + a great health system... That is Spain´s secret!
2277 2018-10-18 20:09:07 Yes, but most of that had to do with drilling and finding enormous quantities of oil.
2278 2018-10-18 20:08:38 I didn’t agree that Saudi produces coffee. No record of Saudi coffee production in any significant level. Even you oil industry is run by Western engineers. Unfortunately, you’d need to work hard if you want to change that. & you’re just not used to working. Too lazy.
2279 2018-10-18 20:08:31 Limit production of gas and diesel burning cars and trucks like Scandinavian countries. 
Plus carbon tax. I have reduced my electricity use  by 1/3.
Norway is producing oil and reducing fuels consumed. The economy and the environment. We need  for the switch.
2280 2018-10-18 20:08:28 We can handle their oil price threat, last time they skyrocketed our oil, we just quit buying it.  There’s two ways to skin a rat as they say

2284 2018-10-18 20:07:54 Yeah I figure the oil station is just a stock base in Europe I think as I don't think they have the prefabs for them yet also keep in mind some roads might be off and that might just be due to AI limits
2285 2018-10-18 20:07:51 We only used them for their oil in the past.  We no longer need their oil. Trump needs them to grift more money in the trump tills.  Making America great? LOL He's making us a laughingstock in the world as we sink lower and lower.
2286 2018-10-18 20:07:42 i mix a little vitamin e oil with aloe vera gel bc the vitamin e tends to be too oily for me lol
2287 2018-10-18 20:07:39 Funny! Also, the US auto industry colluded to eliminate US public rail transit in the mid-20th century (but the auto/tire/oil manufacturers were fine with buses!) and now everyone hates driving but is sociopathically violent against anyone with a bike/scooter/etc. Spread the word

2290 2018-10-18 20:07:30 No it's not stupid...! It's just too hard to think like someone born in a family with trillions of dollars, unlimited and unrestricted access to oil revenue, unchallenged authority to rule over millions of people.
2291 2018-10-18 20:07:29 . Shebi u dey underrate garri. See how God does his things. Now you know that garri is on some Crude oil level. Respect the #Garri
2292 2018-10-18 20:07:06 It’s not that they didn’t listen, they just didn’t listen to you. Instead, they listened to the experts, including the oil industry itself, I might add. Sometimes there are politicians who have the courage to do the right thing, even if it’s not the most popular.
2293 2018-10-18 20:07:04 Its funny how subsidised fuel is so expensive in the UK it's almost like petrol and oil are heavily taxed
2294 2018-10-18 20:07:02 Para los que desconocen las propiedades del CBD oil, no posee ningún tipo de efecto eufórico o psicoactivo ya que carece del THC que es el componente principal del cannabis recreativo.

2302 2018-10-18 20:06:38 I'm not sure you understood what the world went through in the last recession and more what #LDCs that were solely dependant on crude oil and dollars went through.
#NOi was crying austerity even before #2014 with crude oil doing fairly well.
2303 2018-10-18 20:06:29 I was gonna get cute for my birthday but it guess I’ll just look cute for oil spill lol
2304 2018-10-18 20:06:21 Indeed. Saudi Arabia will survive this after some bumpy times, especially if oil prices go up. There is a lot more to international finance than news cycles.
2305 2018-10-18 20:06:17 Ahhh! Imagine that. Steve Schwartzman! A good friend of Tiny Trump.  Also believed to have some ownership in Russian Rosneft Oil.
2306 2018-10-18 20:06:14 Having the knowledge to know how to change oil, feels like a small but fantastic quality. Saves so much money too. #diyoilchange

2310 2018-10-18 20:05:45 I'm afraid I don't fall into that audience. Most that ever goes on my face besides water and soap is some food if I'm not paying attention or some beard oil if I'm feeling like looking shiny.

2312 2018-10-18 20:05:40  The floors in that office don’t have enough oil on them.
2313 2018-10-18 20:05:40 Because even though they are radical muslims who slammed jets into prominent US landmarks, selling them weapons is super important in keeping defense contractors in business.

Oh...and oil.

2315 2018-10-18 20:05:31 We’ve made the more or less strategic calculation that we’d rather have KSA monarchs more-than-nominally subservient to us than monarchs truly under the Ulema’s thumb. 

(Now, falling oil prices may accelerate this problem for the House of Saud anyway, so there’s that).
2316 2018-10-18 20:05:26 Is the pope catholic?
2317 2018-10-18 20:05:25 Viable and commercially viable are completely different terms you dope:  

“commercially viable”

“the ability of a business, product, or service to compete effectively and to make a profit” 

But you stick to thinking there’s no oil 
2318 2018-10-18 20:05:11 Yes Kim. Women especially need a degree or trade. 
I wk in oil and gas industry. Had I not had a degree, I wouldn’t have been given a 2nd look. 
As a single mom of 2 Daughs, I was able to comfortably provide for my girls.

2329 2018-10-18 20:03:59 Yup I saw them all. Well, all the pics. The oil station doesn't look like spanish ones, but the police car and the toll booth is exactly as it is here, neat!
And some roads (like the one you are on top of a bridge and another crosses from the bottom) it is also very common.

2336 2018-10-18 20:03:24 You need to give the oil a different surface to land on... Something you can obtain in the Rubbish Dump.

2340 2018-10-18 20:03:10 Some of the amazing things you can use jojoba oil for:
Great for hair and scalp
Anti-fungal
High in vitamins and minerals that support healthy skin 
Antioxidant
Since jojoba is non-toxic and non-allergenic, it's a natural product to use on our pets.
2341 2018-10-18 20:03:10 Did you enjoy the first paragraph of Tale of Two Cities, a bit too much?
2342 2018-10-18 20:03:08 He’s for open boarders. He’s for higher taxes. Sanctuary cities. Laws that destroy Texas oil industry. 

He was arrested for Burglary, fleeing the scene of an accident while drunk. 

Campaign violations. 

And ethics violations while in office in El Paso.
2343 2018-10-18 20:03:03 You should go to Calgary and meet with  pipeline companies and oil producers and tell them how you are your government are supporting them, and going to help them in the future.

2348 2018-10-18 20:02:35 Reason Saudi Arabia wants these businessmen to come is they want to diversify their economy, they know they won't run out of oil but they will run out of customers. Getting ready for that they want investment in their country. The question is, who could trust these BARBARIANS?

2352 2018-10-18 20:02:10 Social security is paid for by its own tax, it doesn’t add to the deficit. So when people talk about “cutting social security to reduce the deficit,” they are talking about stealing from Americans’ retirement to pay debts for wars, oil company subsidies and tax cuts for the rich.

2354 2018-10-18 20:01:53 Today's @mbta subway ride smells like a fryolator. Not fried food (that'd be delicious). More like the the old/used fry oil.
2355 2018-10-18 20:01:47 an ally that was largely responsible for 9/11? This is a weak & feeble response from @realDonaldTrump and you. A strong response would be to never buy another penny's worth of oil from this murderous and terrorist sponsoring Saudi Royal Family. You & Trump are historic weaklings!

2357 2018-10-18 20:01:30 i cant tell u bc everyone will think im stupid (which is true) but yeah basically put the egg onto my plate then tried to wash the pan but we all know it's not a good idea to mix hot oil and cold water :-)

2363 2018-10-18 20:01:08 Sask Party is doing well. I wish they had cut spending instead of hiking the PST, but the latter is preferable to a deficit.

Our economy would surely be doing better if the Federal @liberal_party weren't doing everything in its power to kneecap Canada's oil industry.
2364 2018-10-18 20:01:02 I got a pair of inserts for my shoes made by Super Feet. Seriously a game changer. I also got an essential oil roller of #Copaiba from @doterra for the pain/numb/tingly feeling. It helps a ton!!

'I wanted him dead, i had him butchered' 
Then Trump would still cover up and lie for the Saudi's. 
Trump has to keep the Saudi's sweet. The Saudi's can get weapons and markets for their oil elsewhere. 
Trump is weak.

2378 2018-10-18 20:00:02 Is this new re: Golan? Or are u referring to Israel's illegal seizure & outrageous selling of oil & water rights to Murdoch, Cheney, et al?
2379 2018-10-18 19:59:49 Gotta have that oil.
2380 2018-10-18 19:59:47 Whatever you are doing, stop and watch the video to Estranged by @gunsnroses. @axlrose jumps off an oil tanker and is saved by dolphins. @slash then rises from the ocean. It's the coolest thing I've ever seen.
2381 2018-10-18 19:59:45 lol that is not a dick  it is like solid oil formed to be look like an insect ? :D and if you want real subs like me , then verfication clip is the key really ….

2386 2018-10-18 19:59:18 Scott Pruitt used to be our AG. Big friend to local Big Oil, but did put it to chicken farmers in a neighboring state who were dumping in a river that flowed down to us, so that was less terrible.
2387 2018-10-18 19:59:14 No sign of lower oil prices yet!
2388 2018-10-18 19:59:00 "He who is without oil, 
shall throw the first rod" Compressions 8.7:1
2389 2018-10-18 19:58:56 career and a lie to the rest of Alberta citizens to perpetuate the lie that oil and gas are here to stay. The oil industry is preparing for their own sunset, so should the people of this province who have depended on it for a livelihood or a source of wealth for the province.
2390 2018-10-18 19:58:56 The Sauds use oil money and royal power to instantiate some of the Ulema’s wishes, and the Ulema in turn confers religious legitimacy on the Sauds. The whole thing very nearly fell apart in ‘76 with the Seige of Mecca (there’s a great book by that title on the affair).
2391 2018-10-18 19:58:53 Unfortunately none of this Merch would be of my oil paintings. It would be simple digital designs. I
2392 2018-10-18 19:58:49 Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides by @SOPHIEMSMSMSM is still my album of the year and there has been a lot of good stuff out this year. A CD/Vinyl release would be awesome :)
2393 2018-10-18 19:58:16 Just got $15 off my oil change for being cute 
2394 2018-10-18 19:58:07 Exactly what @jkenney is trying to do in Alberta. Praying for another NDP term but the people here have been drunk on high oil revenues for so long they love #capitalism koolaid.
2395 2018-10-18 19:58:05 prompting have reduced the impact oil sands has on the Alberta govt. by requesting a carbon tax on oil sands, there is the understanding this will increase the appeal for such a dirty product.

As for your guffaws about a sunset industry. Exxon has acknowledged oil is a major
2396 2018-10-18 19:58:03 Pizza is one of the Italian soul foods. My fav is Sicilian pizza when it get a crispy olive oil crust on the bottom. Def Mushrooms, olives, onions maybe chicken or shrimp.  No processed meats thank you.
2397 2018-10-18 19:57:52 At the most basic level, it’s about oil access and the fact that this is the least-bad of the predictable vipers. 

The House of Saud and the Wahhabi Ulema have a symbiotic relationship.
2398 2018-10-18 19:57:48 So... Vegan butter or coconut oil? #vegan #baking #veganbaking #advice
2399 2018-10-18 19:57:45 It’s time for action against evil monsters who believe that because of their wealth & oil refineries, they’re untouchable. You can’t expect any help from #Trump, he has already indicated that money is more important than the death of Jamal Khashoggi. #BoycottSaudi #ImpeachTrump
2400 2018-10-18 19:57:36 You would also know that oil sands are dirtier than crude, more expensive to refine & require diluent to transport. Alberta has a bad reputation for pushing dirty oil. Oil CEO’s have used a strategy to increase the appeal of oil sands. They’ve cleaned up their act and with govt
2401 2018-10-18 19:57:32 The cooking oil situation i  this country.. has reached.. another level..
2402 2018-10-18 19:57:24 I understand we all need cooking oil but are not overdoing 
Sometimes i think we are our own worst enemy
2403 2018-10-18 19:57:20 Oil has pulled back 10%
2404 2018-10-18 19:57:01 Listennnn no it don’t if i gotta drown that shit with oil flat iron it 500 times and the ends still look raspy lace be feeling like the screen door trust me some wigs be TRASH
2405 2018-10-18 19:56:47 I see, sad what socialism does to a country with the largest proven oil reserves on the planet.
2406 2018-10-18 19:56:26 I used to help teach that stuff... remind me when I see you and I'll tell you of my experience doing that near an oil rig in the NORTH (cold as hell) SEA for reals!!
2407 2018-10-18 19:56:19 your fursona vaping but its a bottle of olive oil
2408 2018-10-18 19:56:17 A spiritual snake oil salesman putting profit before human life? 

Color me shocked.
2409 2018-10-18 19:56:16 How is the power produced,silly comment,we have already Seen the weather affects the turbines, it’s rather coal or oil to run as we seam to hate uranium power ,it’s time we got rid of the stupid politics

2411 2018-10-18 19:56:13 alternative, and the price we can fetch for oil sands is diminishing. So the best way to make money is through efficient means, like consolidating. The banks have recommended consolidation.
2412 2018-10-18 19:56:10 Just played: SOPHIE - Is It Cold in the Water? (OIL OF EVERY PEARL'S UN-INSIDES)
2413 2018-10-18 19:56:09 The politicans are just the middle men. The real targets should be the money/power behind them. Murdoch...Koches...big oil...big coal...etc.
2414 2018-10-18 19:56:09 I told my moma I needed a oil change, I’m thinking she was gone pay for it. Forgot I been give her my debit card  she showed me.

2416 2018-10-18 19:56:03 thanks for the smile... Cause when you get a oil change -yo' hood open while driving kinda Day..
2417 2018-10-18 19:55:47 Yes oil appears to be the root of all evil. We're caught in a trap. If KSA dumps the $ our economy cd plunge into depression. IMO almost certainly would. If oil prices go up,it hurs. If oil prices go down it hurts. We're on a roller coaster-a perpetual one. -2
2418 2018-10-18 19:55:45 Thinking of jumping on the bandwagon & buying an oil diffuser along with some essential oils. Any of my friends have any tips & anything they recommend?
2419 2018-10-18 19:55:43 Oya na...
2420 2018-10-18 19:55:38 Oil Man deve ter feito alguma participação no time dos lobos descamisados.
2421 2018-10-18 19:55:32 sometimes people use "soft butch" to mean like a woman in makeup wearing a buttondown, but I would like to propose a definition more based on my style, ie an aesthetic that suggests I'm a provider who knows how to change a car's oil but a reality that absolutely fucking not
2422 2018-10-18 19:55:28 We all know palm oil production is an issue we need to act on. So why do the makers of Dove, Kit Kat, Colgate and others buy their palm oil from Wilmar, a supplier linked to destroying thousands of hectares of pristine rainforest?
2423 2018-10-18 19:55:05 That is welcomed too
2424 2018-10-18 19:55:04 Yeah bro im a ambassador for cbd oil
2425 2018-10-18 19:54:56 I'm guessing about 5% to 10% of UK oil comes from Saudi Arabia. Suppose we did have to give it up ? Khashoggi was literally cut to pieces ALIVE, its almost beyond belief. I could make anti-brexit capital out of this but its way beyond that. What is going on there?
2426 2018-10-18 19:54:53 You do oil changes 
2427 2018-10-18 19:54:47 How did the oil and grease miss the white hijab

2429 2018-10-18 19:54:33 We'd still need those corp but scaled back. To eliminate them could invite invasion. It's not just oil. Once Nixon struck a deal with KSA to accept only US$,our dollars became the world's trading currency giving us cheap money & huge control on trade,squeezing others out. -1
2430 2018-10-18 19:54:32 1. Oven cooked bacon - bacon goes the cold oven, turn on to 400d and just monitor until you're good.
2. Roasted veggies - Chef 102: roasted vegetables are amazing and stupid easy. Use them.
3. Soak like french toast - get some thick bread and soak it in oil and spices / herbs.
2431 2018-10-18 19:54:25 I’m always reminded how dependent I am on coconut oil when I run out of it.
2432 2018-10-18 19:54:23 Oil prices could fall further on rising US oil production - Dow Jones citing Internal OPEC report
2433 2018-10-18 19:54:22 It's a complicated multi faceted issue with a lot of misinformation. Perhaps the most dishonest is comparisons of immigration from 1800's, early 20th century to now. Economic and societal issues are not even comparable given changes over time and yet to come.
2434 2018-10-18 19:54:16 This mint almond oil is making my head feel like a iceberg. Deep conditioning is essential
2435 2018-10-18 19:54:14 Lol at those days when I wouldn’t leave the house unless I had makeup on. I literally walk out these days with coconut oil in my hair. Like 0 shits given. 
2436 2018-10-18 19:54:12 They really help because they give you a sense of literally where you are in that moment & this can result in calming you down. Yeah, please don’t take pills.

Try lavender oil for sleep, also try writing - even if you don’t know what to write, just write.
2437 2018-10-18 19:54:08 Neo cons benefit from our so-called friendship not us I’m tired of turning a blind eye while Saudi purges the Middle East of it’s Christians it’s next goal is to purge Middle East of Shiites while we cheer them on & help keep the price of oil artificially high for them
2438 2018-10-18 19:54:02 Do you remember back in the late 80's early 90's when Castrol oil used to do NFL hat giveaways for courtoroy hats with the big name logos rocked that shit with my starter raiders jacket.
2439 2018-10-18 19:53:59 Oil and water
2440 2018-10-18 19:53:53 @OnTheGoCBC At least Mr. Reid said he'd stop burning the midnight oil... every little bit counts ;)
2441 2018-10-18 19:53:48 With this traffic eh, I'll just teach you how to make tea.
2442 2018-10-18 19:53:43 Unfortunately, they are all the same. My opinion only. In the end, both sides take our money, make promises, and then do what they can to make themselves rich, usually by taking money from oil or banks or other big companies. They all lie.
2443 2018-10-18 19:53:40 Which son? . It's all me abeg.
2444 2018-10-18 19:53:40 Oil = money = lobbying + weapons.
If there'd never been oil, Saudi would never have been courted by anyone, just a worthless desert scrubland
2445 2018-10-18 19:53:19 It's getting close to Halloween, demonic possession? 

Have you been tested for epilepsy? Also there's been a lot of clinical success treating seizures with cannabinoid oil. Sounds mental but it's genuinely true
2446 2018-10-18 19:53:18 Def need to get my oil changed this week...
2447 2018-10-18 19:53:15 First, try to drill for oil in Artic then greenwash. #OkThankYou
2448 2018-10-18 19:53:04 NNPC denies culpability in Abia oil pipeline fire
2449 2018-10-18 19:53:04 I call  B.S   This is all about the Saudies, Trump wanted oil to come down. Now the Saudies will comply, hoping white house will white wash this matter with the Washington newspaper reporter.
2450 2018-10-18 19:52:55 2 wake up. The wealth in money, is a facade. It isn't real, they could have warehouses full of , tankers of oil... But that is only worth something as long as we remain in the system they need us to believe in. If they r willing 2create illusion of dictatorship.
2451 2018-10-18 19:52:50 @telebusiness how can you let a pro green energy journalist write a factually incorrect story on oil. Pathetic. You are hurting my investment. I hope @UKOGlistedonAIM  sue you or at least get a published apology. #ukog
2452 2018-10-18 19:52:45 Quisiera leer acerca de esto en un medio que no sea o haya sido de Cristóbal López, que era dueño de OIL, que retuvo muchos millones del Estado en concepto de iva y nunca pagó...once mil millones eran?
2453 2018-10-18 19:52:44 imagine if iranian oil was flowing ...
2454 2018-10-18 19:52:41 Hemp oil ~ make sure it is potent + 100% organic, non-gmo and pure.  Most aren't.
2455 2018-10-18 19:52:36 Hmmmm... IMO 2020. International Maritime Organization rule for ships to use reduced sulphur content fuel oil by 2020, 3.5% to 0.5%.

$HSE expects to benefit from a boost in demand for diesel as ship operators switch from high-sulphur fuel oil.
2456 2018-10-18 19:52:36 Always glad to see you back in Oil Country big guy!

2460 2018-10-18 19:52:03 Just ordered the 400mg spray oil. Been using the 5% one from Holland & Barratt which has helped sleeping massively. Hope this one is better
2461 2018-10-18 19:51:51 Don't be surprised to see Europe be flexible with Saudi Arabia. They don't want high oil or a holy war to break out as SA are the jeepers of the two holiest cities in Islam.
2462 2018-10-18 19:51:36 You, you sorry Judas parading as a leader, would/will, sell out American honor for Saudi gold and oil. Shame on you.

2465 2018-10-18 19:51:26 fake news . china and india have a tone of coal plants and oil plants and people there choke to death on smoke so fake
2466 2018-10-18 19:51:06 I believe XO-1 is the prototype of the Advanced Power armor seen in fallout 2. So they could drop XO-1 in any game. It’d been over 200 years and the Enclave on the oil rig had been making newer upgraded versions.
2467 2018-10-18 19:51:00 Wickedness

2475 2018-10-18 19:50:13 Shit trifling it’s nothing but oil 
2476 2018-10-18 19:50:05 If you pour any type of grease like oil and stuff down your sink YOU’RE A WHOLE BITCH!
2477 2018-10-18 19:50:03 I hear people r queuing for cooking oil.......back in the 90s wen it was in abundance i remember my mama using animal fat stored in the freezer for frying.......

2480 2018-10-18 19:49:59 What would you propose? Stop buying oil from the Saudis? Stop selling them weapons?
2481 2018-10-18 19:49:59 Now we know why Duterte was talking earlier about God supposedly not blessing Philippines with oil. Laying the basis.
2482 2018-10-18 19:49:50 Cloves of garlic which have been in oil, yes!!! Love them. Not straight out of the blub though ....

2494 2018-10-18 19:48:41 @maddibuss0w just read your nut allergy article. Peanut oil does not have the protein need to cause a reaction. It is safe for nut allergic people to eat.

2498 2018-10-18 19:48:24 I'm highlighting the inconsistent reporting by @BBCNews where ambush is fair game in one context but avoided like the plague when it comes to holding the Brexit snake oil salesmen to account.
2499 2018-10-18 19:48:18 True.And the use of cannabis oil helps manage it as well
2500 2018-10-18 19:48:07 why am i still ashy after i drenched my legs with coconut oil self care twitter please amputate my legs
2501 2018-10-18 19:48:01 It is all consistent with Trump and his actions as POTUS.
What beguiles me is that millions of Americans continue to defend his evil choices, like low oil prices over human life & the 1st Amendment.  It is very, very sad.
2502 2018-10-18 19:47:55 I would contact the vet first and let them know that you are going to add CBD Oil to everything. Then I would start with 2 drops under the tongue if possible if not I put the drops in my hand and my dog licks it out of my hand. I would do that twice a day.
2503 2018-10-18 19:47:53 Why does my car have to take the most expensive oil ever? 
2504 2018-10-18 19:47:19 Alas, North Sea Oil is largely done for, otherwise we could simply wait for someone to invade us.
2505 2018-10-18 19:47:18 Ha! you too funny! You like the free stuff over working and earning a good wage. You have to pay for free stuff. 
 That is why Venezuela is in the shape it's in today. A once oil rich country with a thriving middle class, all wiped out. Capitalism is the best way out of poverty!
2506 2018-10-18 19:47:17 Encounter with the oil
2507 2018-10-18 19:47:14 The same guy that has increased the threshold for greenhouse gases, same guy that allows coal companies to dump waste in rivers, same guy that has allowed increased drilling of oil...yeah that same asshole

2512 2018-10-18 19:46:36 @cnn @maddow stop trying to push the narrative that it’s all about the oil.  FYI Saudi Arabia is the only major middle eastern nation besides Israel that has been working to undermine the radical ideologists especially Al queda. we can’t just abandon our relationship.Facts first!

2516 2018-10-18 19:46:18 Or we can have the way the Republicans want it to look. Closed borders, no immigrants, rich to pay zero taxes so the rest of us suffer, destroyed environment, no national parks, oil drills on every coast, thick, black coal smoke, Nazis everywhere, no healthcare, etc, etc
2517 2018-10-18 19:46:13 Speaking of stopping payment, how about not buying oil from Saudi Arabia? Let the Royals not be able to keep their subjects happy and fed. They can’t dissect while alive several million people.
2518 2018-10-18 19:46:07 CBD oil get you high or what???
2519 2018-10-18 19:46:02 Function of Beauty shampoo and argan oil 
2520 2018-10-18 19:46:01 Haha ok.. Better go research that one.. Ever heard of edibles. Try some concentrated hash oil on ur toast and get back to us..
2521 2018-10-18 19:45:59 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
2522 2018-10-18 19:45:53 When they asked me if I planned to pick my car up tomorrow morning I didn’t think they were serious. 

I took it for a fucking oil change, y’all. An oil change.
2523 2018-10-18 19:45:46 Blend 1 cup caviar with 4 tsps ginger. Sprinkle with Olive Oil. Slice into 1 inch pieces. Serve on salad
2524 2018-10-18 19:45:39 Cauliflower recipe:
Cut cauliflower into bite size pieces
Place on baking tray and put into a pre heated oven for 20 minutes at 160
When the cauliflower has cooled put in blender and whizz it up with a little oil until it is a smooth sauce
Flush down the toilet. #eatwellforless
2525 2018-10-18 19:45:33 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2526 2018-10-18 19:45:22 So yes we can loose our revenue from resources to satisfy the UN. Now will the UN stop the middle east oil producers to stop also or is this just a western country target since western countries are close to being oil self sufficient and a threat to the oil cartel.
2527 2018-10-18 19:45:17 Coman teach me how to cook na
2528 2018-10-18 19:45:03 Arms and oil and loan bailouts will prevail. They will simply muscle through and wait for the next news cycle. Midterms will muffle the outrage and the corruption continues. Who will do anything after all?
2529 2018-10-18 19:44:52 HEY !!!..  AA- ( watchdog).......World oil price down 9% .....PUMP PRICES  have not moved a penny down !!!!!...... the other way around & the Pump Price is up within 48 hrs......come on ! do something !!
2530 2018-10-18 19:44:46 acceptable is the new oil
2531 2018-10-18 19:44:38 But I guess going after a little oil in Iraq was worth losing thousands of American lives and a trillion dollars? #Priorities

2534 2018-10-18 19:44:23 @saraiswong me when I’m using raspberry oil as sunscreen like boo boo the fool!!! ANYWHOMST let’s get these ordinary products 
2535 2018-10-18 19:44:21 Fracing is a method used after a well is drilled. It would destroy oil and gas development. Meaning from beginning to end oil development is shut down.
2536 2018-10-18 19:44:10 Please, don't try to advocate for terrorists.
2537 2018-10-18 19:44:02 Financing in place for a 1mbd pipe before the launch of the open season... the first one in H1 lead to the project being cancelled. As credible as EPIC converting its yet to be built NGL line so that its crude oil clients use it for a quarter before the crude line comes on stream
2538 2018-10-18 19:44:01 OIL, petrochemicals, soap & shampoo,toilet paper, tissue “to be clean but you are still stinky”, trash bags,bandage,syringe,plastic&iron pipes,plastic&iron barrels,rubber,leather, aluminium,steel,toys,tires,car batteries,car body,mega generators,solar power cells,....
2539 2018-10-18 19:44:01 I prefer that to the gelatinous goo, but doctor wants me eating chia seeds, hemp oil 
2540 2018-10-18 19:43:39 Obama be like I don't know man, Stimulus was mostly in my admin, probably while the Saudis were loading up from previous Oil sales--Good Luck.
2541 2018-10-18 19:43:33 Hold on they plan on importing 2000 specialized caterers to cook food for the people that will be working the oil and gas fields!???? 

I’m sorry, but Elly Karuhanga must have been hungry when he said that. 
Friends from the Chamber of Mines n Petroleum must explain this
2542 2018-10-18 19:43:27 Blood and oil is movie I can never forget
2543 2018-10-18 19:43:22 Btw not a cloud in the sky. 53° going to 60! A C-130 just flew over my house near tree top level. Almost as wonderful as back in the 80's "Nelli" the last flying B-29 flew directly ovr my cutting my lawn in Corpus. Oil all ovr me & I loved it!
2544 2018-10-18 19:43:18 ,,, motor oil?
2545 2018-10-18 19:43:03 yall dog on girls for being strippers but tbh its given me connects for EVERYTHING, got discounts on my phone bill, free food & drinks at multiple places, free oil changes every month, free car detailing, shit if you need a 17 ton machine moved I HAVE A FUCKING CONNECT FOR THAT
2546 2018-10-18 19:43:01 I have gone through the LPG option so maybe 2 x 200’s or 2 x 200T oil boilers. I have got a go pro so maybe worth a shot at that
2547 2018-10-18 19:42:55 Nope. Less oil and a bunch of extra flavoring.
2548 2018-10-18 19:42:52 Lol this is just the beginning dear.
2549 2018-10-18 19:42:27 Ted cruz opposes regulations on the oil&gas industries bc they're "bad for us Texans", bro do you realize the Earth is dying and Texas and all you Texans are on Earth??
2550 2018-10-18 19:42:26 #sc01 So @karringtonsc and her stance on offshore drilling. Lets dig deeper, she has accepted donations from Oil companies. When push comes to shove, whose interests do you think she will vote for? If she wants more $$, she will vote for Big Oil & We all know she wants more $$
2551 2018-10-18 19:42:26 @potus has expressed his concerns about damaging the relationship with Saudi Arabia. The investment in arms could move to China or Russia for arms imports, also depends on Saudi Arabia for oil stability, within the kingdomwould be “stabbing its economy to death”
2552 2018-10-18 19:42:14 이게ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ이게뭐지ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ. ......
아니 이게 진짜 뭐지..........
2553 2018-10-18 19:42:13 that’s me at times. I take a multi vitamin, iron, super b complex, fish oil, 5-HTP, turmeric, and that’s basically it
2554 2018-10-18 19:42:13 You don't need oil to toast breadcrumbs... just like nuts and seeds spread em on a baking tray and whack in the oven use a timer so you don't forget them. 
 #eatwellforless
2555 2018-10-18 19:42:10 True but while we buy their oil &  sell them weapons we can't take the moral high ground. The difference with this man is he's a U.S. citizen so the yanks won't turn their backs on him ulike the 1000s killed in Yemen as Stalin said 1 death is a tragedy a million a statistic.
2556 2018-10-18 19:42:09 We may win by being better in the long run, but in the short run if he puts his fingers in my salad, he will need a dressing, and I don't mean oil and vinegar.
2557 2018-10-18 19:42:07 I’m encountering with the Oil today. #RosaEncounter
2558 2018-10-18 19:42:05 The name in the tweet is apparently just what Mexicans call chuck steak. Look for it at a Mexican market. Thin sliced, cooked in coconut oil.
2559 2018-10-18 19:41:30 Adulting task of the day: Get my oil changed 
2560 2018-10-18 19:41:28 I will try my absolute best to talk a customer out of water based satin/gloss. Coverage durability, & finish are incomparable to oil. I will add it’s not just a problem with Dulux but all water based satin/gloss available.
2561 2018-10-18 19:41:25 That's the new Nazi plan get all oil rich countries to help kill off most of Islam, at lest that's what they tell Saudi! Saudi run all middle east, just like they want! Then they'll end all Jews, with all that winning, watch out Saudi be gone!  Plans within Plans Crista!
2562 2018-10-18 19:41:19 this blister i had is gonna scar bc i got dirt and motor oil in it :(
2563 2018-10-18 19:41:17 We know a family whose daughter has a form of epilepsy, was having 20+ seizures a day for almost 2 years, they started her on a cbd oil and has maybe 2 or 3 month at the most. It definitely has its benefits medically !
2564 2018-10-18 19:41:08 Atiku said that the restructuring he mean will not change how oil money oil wells is shared, so what restructuring are you talking about? Better we #Biafrans just focus on our demand. There can never be nothing like restructuring in the z00 called nigeria.
2565 2018-10-18 19:41:07 Will the Saudis be able to use their oil as a shield from retaliation as promised by @realDonaldTrump . It is clear that the Turks have a very strong circumstantial case against the Saudis. But as with Jimmy Hoffa, no body... no indictments.  So Trump will cave.  #KhashoggiMurder
2566 2018-10-18 19:40:50 argan oil of Morocco shampoo + conditioner in the blue bottle and i use the heat/frizz protection spray as well, works wonders for my hair
2567 2018-10-18 19:40:50 You know fact check after the last debate shows Beto lied
His mom democrat vote 15 out of 17 elections. What would he lie?
His $10 tax on barrel of oil>>>true, Cruz was correct

And the police report shows he DID try to flee the scene from his DUI wreck

#LyingBeto is the reality
2568 2018-10-18 19:40:41 Why?
I was taught that most members of government "the govies" are in a removed world of "leadership" like the lords and landowners of old.
There are theories that "why?" is "destiny" for some challenge to humanity or some shit.
Because meanwhile, about that oil pipe + children?
2569 2018-10-18 19:40:30 Does someone or some organization pay you to spread misinformation? You do own a communications company and you are pushing propaganda and misinformation. As a business owner who supposedly keeps informed, you should know that oil sands are expensive. Shale oil is a cheaper
2570 2018-10-18 19:40:30 Such things only favours the rich. I am even suprised why South Africa still trade Oil with European countries wheas Nigeria n Libya have largest oil plants
2571 2018-10-18 19:40:29 バルカロールの平和は俺が守る！　なんてな♪
2572 2018-10-18 19:40:25 Talking about it’s smooth NAW your bitch hair smooth over there looking like a human coconut oil
2573 2018-10-18 19:40:21 I’m surprised no metal bands have licensed a beard oil yet
2574 2018-10-18 19:40:20 Matt isn't doing anything for Montana. Matt lied about owning cattle.
Matt plans to give mineral and oil rights to big corporations, under the guise of taking care of public lands.
Dems are not interested in taking your guns, that's an ignorant lie to win over blue collar men
2575 2018-10-18 19:40:17 It barely cost me 75$ for an oil change and my truck holds 3x the oil of a car, the fuck ?
2576 2018-10-18 19:40:13 Saudi is just one of many companies that provide oil. The is no way to know just how much Saudi gas is in your tank. 

The issue is WWE supporting and propagating a government that not only condoned the murder of a reporter, but one that perpetrated it and then covered it up.
2577 2018-10-18 19:40:09 知ってる？スーパーってタダで牛脂くれるんだよ。
2578 2018-10-18 19:40:07 Six individuals in an oil smuggling group, including two Asayish employees, have been arrested in an operation by intelligence services and the Directorate General of Asayish. Further details will be published when available.
2579 2018-10-18 19:40:04 Family Nutrition: Cheez Whiz Cheese Dip this October? Its top four ingredients are whey, milk, canola oil and maltodextrin.
2580 2018-10-18 19:40:03 me buying the cheapest vegetable oil spread instead of the olive oil one i like is a DIRECT SIGN that i need to save $400 by the end of december to pay rent uwu
2581 2018-10-18 19:40:03 weed olive oil, butter or honey?
2582 2018-10-18 19:39:59 You don't have any mayo or mustard or any sauce? Olive oil?
2583 2018-10-18 19:39:48 For a second, I thought you'd taken up oil painting.
2584 2018-10-18 19:39:46 Hey #KeepCanadaWorking show me some facts on price of oil leaving BC port and the market for it. See Alex arguments
2585 2018-10-18 19:39:44 Ameen
2586 2018-10-18 19:39:40 Tanto rojo me duele los ojos, tiene una pinta que si. Yonilandia  rojo chillón, oil rojo sangre, tiene olor a rebote mal mañana
2587 2018-10-18 19:39:38 Its a freedom issue for them... plus all media is fed by Saudi oil money. So who knows why they are targeting the Indian traditions...
2588 2018-10-18 19:39:26 More ham bun Salami, aka, prince of the Saudis.  Without oil he is the prince of nothing.
2589 2018-10-18 19:39:21 Hey @RachelAndJun I've been trying to replicate in Jun's puffed rice recipe. But despite the oil being at the proper temperature, my rice won't puff/pop. Any advice?
2590 2018-10-18 19:39:19 Wow...This hit the nail in the head. America is #Complicit and this will not change until we change our dependency on oil. PERIOD.
2591 2018-10-18 19:39:15 Why do we pollute America's environment + make Americans sick to ship American oil and gas to China + Mexico when these countries are developing clean, renewable energy much faster than us.  Electricity from wind and solar is less than half the cost of from dirty oil and gas.
2592 2018-10-18 19:39:11 @NASA Through a number of sources, likely, to become available in the, approximately, immediate future (filters for exhaust systems, oil based light bulbs, sewage treatment, potentially even underwear); a recycling program for refining compounds relevant to teraforming missions.
2593 2018-10-18 19:39:10 Getting my first oil change by myself ever!!! Wish me luck!!!
2594 2018-10-18 19:39:08 @DomenduOge @gaf1323 @OnifadeRaheemot @akintade_wale @afeez_adeosun @Ol_Timi Diamonds to Botswana are like oil to Nigeria. That is all the economy of Botswana is known for. Agriculture makes up like 2.4% of their GDP. Of that 2.4%, 80% of their agric sector is livestock (Cattle)
2595 2018-10-18 19:38:54 Definitely just bought CBD oil for my 16 year old diabetic cat.
2596 2018-10-18 19:38:53 @RosaKnust the Glory and the oil
2597 2018-10-18 19:38:51 Oil & vinegar one day will have to battle of their jar.
2598 2018-10-18 19:38:42 Trump is building a house of cards. Inflation, deficits, debt, rising interest rates, tariffs, oil prices, loss of trust from key allies, pressure on the dollar, etc.  The Dow is showing early signs of the trouble that is coming.
2599 2018-10-18 19:38:37 The coverage of water based satin or gloss is dreadful. Try it side by side, on an internal door that’s been 10 years since it was last painted. Two coats of water based satin vs acrylic undercoat & oil satin. See if you think the finish is satisfactory.
2600 2018-10-18 19:38:36 Sound of victory. 
I shout hallelujah!!
Encounter with the oil
Join us #RosaEncounter
2601 2018-10-18 19:38:30 I hope that I live long enough to see the day your oil wells run dry and your people return to camel herding
2602 2018-10-18 19:38:29 Oil and money...American public is being fooled by this President. America needs to wake up.
2603 2018-10-18 19:38:28 I mean this is fantastic and I am really happy about it. I try to only use products which are cruelty free. However, you really need to stop using palm oil in your products. The deforestation caused by palm oil collection is harming animals and the environment.
2604 2018-10-18 19:38:27 When Keep It Real Goes Wrong>>RT @_ItsMissBre: So. 

Today.

I sent a text that said 'I don't know why my pussy is so good, it just is' with a Beyonce dancing GIF......

To my grandmother.

I am still on the phone with her trying to keep her from baptizing me in holy oil.

HELP.
2605 2018-10-18 19:38:23 Ahh I should’ve known. Can’t wait to spend my coins on one of everything (Cleanser , Toner , Oil , Masque snd Creme) It’s marked in my calendar w reminders and everything 
2606 2018-10-18 19:38:19 I just pan seared two vegan burgers, and then cooked chunked sweet potatoes with garlic, onion, vegan butter, oil and broccoli raub. I threw in a tiny bit of soy sauce and Carolina style bbq sauce. So good.
2607 2018-10-18 19:38:19 Suspect, in worse case scenario, Saudis would push oil up to $90-100/barrel from current ~ $80.00. Could go higher factoring Iran sanctions. Thus, everything that uses oil as a basis for energy could go up at least~20%. Will see how people and their govts balance these forces.
2608 2018-10-18 19:38:18 America got very rich of Iranian resources. It’s a two way street. I actually work partly in the oil business. US had to import because cost of production was too high compared to price. Now that oil is high, it’s economical. Not simply EPA. The environment also matters btw
2609 2018-10-18 19:38:16 $10 and two hours later, his and my laundry is done. Now just gotta get this oil change and go grocery shopping. Pretty safe to say I wont be attending my history class today  #adulting
2610 2018-10-18 19:38:06 Soak it in penetrative oil, then crush the thing closed a bit with pliers to try and break the rust. Then see if you can free the core with a screwdriver.
2611 2018-10-18 19:38:06 Supporters claim that I-1631 it is a tax on Big Oil, not on consumers. But if this is true, why would Big Oil spend $27 million on TV ads telling voters that I-1631 is a tax on consumers? Huh? Answer me that! #waelex
2612 2018-10-18 19:37:57 I believe at first the press tried to do its job. But from the beginning, & more powerfully with time, the administration turned the briefing into a chaotic shitshow of lies, misdirection, snake oil and general flimflam, so that in the end it collapsed like a tragic train wreck.
2613 2018-10-18 19:37:50 Oil tallies a two session decline of more than 4%
2614 2018-10-18 19:37:41 I LOVE Aveeno and coconut oil is my best friend this time of year!
2615 2018-10-18 19:37:33 Would be fine if he was asking for an investigation,but he is not. He has assumed guilt and is already asking sanctions. Iran, Russia,
Arms, Oil, Middle East stability - ain’t that simple. Let’s not politicize or simplify this situation. Diplomacy is needed. Give it some time.
2616 2018-10-18 19:37:25 Well.....
45's tax cut helps the rich only....no average wage increases..... 
45's tariffs are only driving prices up and jobs out.....
Your health care is, I believe, becoming more un affordable......
And thats before China stopped using American oil......
Thst okay?
2617 2018-10-18 19:37:16 What???? Honestly I admired Ghana because I knew they are free from the wicked french captivity of Africa. All African nations should root out anything France from this continent. However southern Cameroonians are being murdered by biya masterminded by France because of oil
2618 2018-10-18 19:37:16 Oh we'll need all the other energies and then some but only oil and coal fulfil our needs so well. It will run out around 2040 for the likes of you and me and then the pitchforks will be out. Picture The Walking Dead but without the dead.
2619 2018-10-18 19:37:05 If a journalist can be cut to pieces, just for insulting someone, nobody in the world will be safe. You can't contain this kind of retaliation once it starts happening more often. Justice won't be able to keep up, and it will be war, one that cuts of oil from the world...
2620 2018-10-18 19:36:57 Lol nah i know that.. but they not worth no more than oil and chicken.. tbh, oil > chicken > the actual omega 
2621 2018-10-18 19:36:46 Arabica coffee came out of Yemen, which you’re bombing to oblivion these days for refusing to be your Guinea pigs. Saudi isn’t on the list of coffee producers today. It remains a ‘single product’ country, & the oil will run out at some point. Yet the moocher culture remains. 
2622 2018-10-18 19:36:11 $SPY is in free fall down to $185.00...be ready for USD Crash as well and Oil price will Skyrocket Up $369.00 due to Geopolitical tensions between the Global major Powers.
2623 2018-10-18 19:36:07 Price of oil under $70.00 a barrel, so why are gas prices still close to $4.00?
2624 2018-10-18 19:36:02 @MiBlogazine join us @7pm TONITE @Make Believe Club (lower east side) to meet a Latina mama who fought cancer and is now launching a totally organic CBD oil skincare line - she's the 1st MD to do so! #BreakingBarriers #BreastCancerAwarenessMonth msg me here or just mention this!
2625 2018-10-18 19:35:57 Go get an oil change. Just thought I’d remind y’all.
2626 2018-10-18 19:35:55 u can be called the king of depression cooking when the olive oil on pasta actually tastes Yummy :+)
2627 2018-10-18 19:35:53 I say both. They have different jobs. Hyaluronic applied first for hydration and squalane as an oil on top to seal it in.
2628 2018-10-18 19:35:50 There’s special lavender spray for babies. Works a dream. Just like the regular oil but not so harsh x
2629 2018-10-18 19:35:48 Getting an oil change ,tire rotation and alignment plus a weird noise getting looked at 
2630 2018-10-18 19:35:44 Indeed an Encounter with oil #RosaEncounter
2631 2018-10-18 19:35:43 SA is far worse then Iran. The only problem is the oil. And you know why Islam was funded by Mohammed? Because he was fed up with the greedy Saudi's that lived in Mekka in his days. Same kind of characters that are living in SA now.
2632 2018-10-18 19:35:37 you just said it, biggest supplier of oil...american $$$$. we have plenty of our own oil. but stupid epa regulations wont allow us to drill. but that will change..
2633 2018-10-18 19:35:37 Social security is paid for by its own tax, it doesn’t add to the deficit. So when people talk about “cutting social security to reduce the deficit,” they are talking about stealing from Americans’ retirement to pay debts for wars, oil company subsidies and tax cuts for the rich.
2634 2018-10-18 19:35:36 got my car washed , i just need to schedule a oil change appt now then i’m done with this car
2635 2018-10-18 19:35:34 COCONUT OIL!!!! I asked my eyelash lady and she told em it breaksdown the glue!!!! I need to take mine off too i have like 10 on one eye and 20 on the other 
2636 2018-10-18 19:35:32 Baby powder helps absorb the oil!!
2637 2018-10-18 19:35:30 I swear I used the baby oil. 
2638 2018-10-18 19:35:28 The rate at which we are borrowing money in this country now should be a thing of serious concerns. What happened to all the revenues coming from all the MDAs including the increase in the crude oil in the international market? How about returned loots?
2639 2018-10-18 19:35:25 yes, I realized it wasn't very clear. The credibility question I have is for his former business partners and associates (other than Trump/Stone). How could anyone have believed him before? Is the GOP that rotten that those like him are all they've got? Carpet baggers & snake oil
2640 2018-10-18 19:35:24 Don’t laugh: $400 oil isn’t THAT crazy
2641 2018-10-18 19:35:19 Ah , Fox , the propaganda machine , you make me laugh! Smart and Trump are the exact opposites, it’s like trying to mix oil with water

2645 2018-10-18 19:35:03 Oil and $$$$ make the perfect combo. . 
Saudi Arabia has always been a staunch US ally. 
Despite  most of 9/11 Hijackers being  Saudi nationals,  failed to put a strain on this relationship btwn Washington and Riyadh.

2646 2018-10-18 19:34:51 #ENCOUNTER WITH THE OIL
2647 2018-10-18 19:34:32 pulled into jiffy lube & the guy really had me believing they didnt do oil changes

2650 2018-10-18 19:34:15 So. 

Today.

I sent a text that said 'I don't know why my pussy is so good, it just is' with a Beyonce dancing GIF......

To my grandmother.

I am still on the phone with her trying to keep her from baptizing me in holy oil.

HELP.
2651 2018-10-18 19:34:08 It looks like a neem oil spray and maybe some insecticidal soap is the answer to most things wrong with houseplants
2652 2018-10-18 19:34:03 It's a cop-out to even point out the arms deal, to begin with. They(Trump &Kushner) made a massive $300 billion dollar investment into their oil production operation. It's all part of the same "arms deal". Think that might be why we can't do anything?
2653 2018-10-18 19:33:59 Go sell your snake oil
2654 2018-10-18 19:33:54 So my engine that we’re taking apart was so full of oil it was like a whole ocean cave out and I’m COVERED
2655 2018-10-18 19:33:53 That’s well-oiled machine (aka White House) is do I g some sputtering down in DC, I hear!  Bolton and KellyAnne are at it!  Quick! Who has the oil?!

2660 2018-10-18 19:33:22 I can’t tell u the first thing about doing any maintenance shit with my car. When it’s time for an oil change give it to Ray.

2662 2018-10-18 19:33:12 The #EmptyBarrel in our White House has raised US debt trillion in less than 2 yrs, Gas, food, Oil all cost more, but @realDonaldTrump have himself and his Billionaire #CrimeFamily ANOTHER tax cut, the 2nd, since Bush 2 also gave 1% a tax cut. #VoteBlue
2663 2018-10-18 19:33:09 ending up with scalding hot oil all over my left hand is not what i expected my thursday night to consist of
2664 2018-10-18 19:33:05 @belkabelka love your attitude, and would love it if you could join us @Make Believe @7pm and meet Dr. Millie Hernandez, the 1st MD to launch a completely organic, high-end CBD oil skincare line!
2665 2018-10-18 19:33:04 I drive because I need to in order to work, take my kids to school, etc. Plus, not all oil comes from Saudi Arabia. Entertainment is not a necessity. We need to take a stand for what is right.
2666 2018-10-18 19:32:59 1) great news
2) Blairite MPs and the Labour right are funded in part or solely by the oil industry. Their job is to control the opposition and prevent any meaningful change to the establishment and seeing as we live in the age of oil, that means the Oil Industry.
2667 2018-10-18 19:32:58 Bummer, I was shorting oil 
2668 2018-10-18 19:32:58 to be clear this is not irony. but also the works of peter dale scott are very good if you want to learn about their activities mainly as it relates to the global drug trade and oil, look through the titles and just pick one that seems most interesting to you
2669 2018-10-18 19:32:46 Narrative for Saudi regime change is coming together. An "investigation" will unearth evidence that Saudi royals directly backed 9/11. Then US will invade. Of course it will actually be about having option to back USD with oil
2670 2018-10-18 19:32:46 and, most importantly, why didn't they do that to Saddam Hussein instead of leveling the whole country? Ahhh, chaos to take over the country. The sweet smell of oil. We wouldn't want fully organized Iraqis to control their own resources now, would we?

2673 2018-10-18 19:32:26 My mom keeps asking me if my oil diffuser is an Alexa and won’t step into my apartment until i prove it
2674 2018-10-18 19:32:25 What on Earth are you talking about? Care to elaborate? Iran was the biggest supplier of oil to the US pre-Islamic revolution. Iran was also a massive purchaser of US military equipment and wheat and bailed out Grumman with the F14 program. What do you mean??
2675 2018-10-18 19:32:23 Good in FEH, meanwhile in AL I already spent +3k oil trying to get the fox sisters, RIP.
2676 2018-10-18 19:32:21 Ya, people like to pick and choose what outrage they wanna show. It's fine to have to call off a wrestling show but we can buy oil conscience free and drive off not even thinking about what goes on over there. If people want to be outraged, be consistent.
2677 2018-10-18 19:32:11 Big shoutout to the guy who charged me $50 dollars under the table instead of $90 for my oil change. YOU THE REAL MVP.

2679 2018-10-18 19:31:50 Democrats are evil for wanting healthcare for all, 15$ minimum wage, investing in education and promoting new and well paid industries like renewable energies. While Reps cut tax for the rich, allow drilling of natural reserves for oil and separating kids at the border.  Nuts
2680 2018-10-18 19:31:49 $ oil rub numpy
2681 2018-10-18 19:31:40 Largely bringing "there," here. If I wanted "there," I would move there. 
Many dont want here, they just want to create a better there, here.
2682 2018-10-18 19:31:32 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, and sea ports.
2683 2018-10-18 19:31:19 @Nissan should give me a free oil change for never missing a darn car payment for my 2014 Sentra AND purchasing another 2017 Sentra. Cut a girl a break with these payments :)
2684 2018-10-18 19:30:55 think i need to try some tea tree oil then, got my rook on the other side, that’s cute!

2686 2018-10-18 19:30:52 Oil and gas industry here. I average 80 hours a week and 120 is a good week for me lol. Idk what the problem is if as a game dev you got 60-100 hours in a week. Always thought that was a good thing.
2687 2018-10-18 19:30:46 Kagiso proposing whilst laying in bed my man. Poor guy should know though that the Khoza's and marriages are like water and oil
2688 2018-10-18 19:30:43 A lot of the UK spend will disappear, billions of it. Trident. HS2. UK infrastructure. UK defence. & we won't be giving away billions in tax breaks either. & we can set economic & social policy specific for Scotland. & deficits are normal for most nations... unless they have oil.
2689 2018-10-18 19:30:34 "Making them dependent on coal/oil"  Who is doing that?  And who do you think  they are going to pay?  Most of India remains unexplored for coal, crude and gas; whatever they find it - belongs to them.

2691 2018-10-18 19:30:27 Given that level [KE is at 3%] we are unlikely to become self-sufficient in cooking oil production in the near future. UG's population [on a straight scale] would double in 20 years.
2692 2018-10-18 19:30:18 and since the mascara ruined ur lashes put castor oil on them
2693 2018-10-18 19:30:13 Did you know that it takes about a #gallon of #oil to produce every new #toner and #laser #cartridge? If you have some on your hands, be sure to find reliable #recyclers to dispose of them! That was we can save #resources that would have been used to create these new #cartridges.

2695 2018-10-18 19:30:08 Have to remember, many patients are not  even using flower. Half of sales is oil. Again the average person is not up to making oils at home either, especially oils that must be consistent batch to batch for treatment of some illnesses like epilepsy. Home made is not consistent?
2696 2018-10-18 19:30:07 I have to ask.. If we are truly on the brink of planetary destruction.. and I believe we are.  Why are we still backing candidates who are sponsored by Big Oil and the MIC?

2697 2018-10-18 19:29:59 @Freshfmibadan @rollybello  see we have to say other things when it comes to NNPC. That corporation is our major problem. When crude oil price reduces, we still subsidize when it increases we still pay for subsidy. Now it is under recovery and not subsidy.@APCAreAsCorruptAsPDP

2699 2018-10-18 19:29:56 SAME !!! u can use coconut oil to remove ur mascara/makeup in general AND i discovered baby shampoo is actually amazing to remove makeup don’t ask how i figured that out i was desperate
2700 2018-10-18 19:29:51 Oil will never be useless (unfortunately). It will always outperform all other energies e.g. you could never launch a space rocket off solar or wind power. As for what they're all fighting about, who knows?
2701 2018-10-18 19:29:50 I have no interest in following your news... but your promotion landed it on my page.. and then we are distraught to see you are tying up with a murderer of tribals and natives and destroyer of local communities... but then you are big oil of course, thats what you all do right?
2702 2018-10-18 19:29:49 You daith is cute af! I almost gave up on my helix but I babied them with salt water and tea tree oil for a few weeks and one day they were suddenly fine and haven’t bothered me since
2703 2018-10-18 19:29:38 Was that @Oil_Check?
2704 2018-10-18 19:29:33 Oil could fall further on rising U.S. supplies, says internal OPEC report
2705 2018-10-18 19:29:30 "pumping unregulated undisclosed"... it's like an oil spill...
2706 2018-10-18 19:29:26 Donald, can't you just take the Saudi oil?
2707 2018-10-18 19:29:19 That's true.

But there are fundamental differences as well.

Progressivism and The US Constitution are like oil and water.

Conservatives love the Constitution

Liberals do not... They want to change it.

1st and 2nd amendments are problematic to Democrats.
2708 2018-10-18 19:29:16 WTI Crude Oil -1.4% to 68.71 bbl $USO
Gold +0.2% at 1230.20 oz $GLD
Copper -1.1% 2.75 lb $CU
2709 2018-10-18 19:29:15 Very bad decision against a “strategic ally” as the investigation is still under process and there is no guilty. Anyway, buckle up, oil price will be 100$ or over. Russia & China will be the winners out of this.
2710 2018-10-18 19:29:06 That $100 million down payment is a good clue.  It's about crude oil and everything tied to it.
2711 2018-10-18 19:29:06 I think they truly don't care what people think and let's face it , what repercussions could there be ? It's not like anyone is going to stop selling them billions of dollars worth of arms or buying oil .They may even get another prime seat at UN .
2712 2018-10-18 19:28:49 @immuno_stuff we are near capacity for our launch party tonite, but would love it if you could join us @Make Believe @7pm and meet Dr. Millie Hernandez, the 1st MD to launch a completely organic, high-end CBD oil skincare line!
2713 2018-10-18 19:28:44 One fine day people will wake up to find there is no Saudi Arabia . The Israelis wud have annexed the oil producing areas and bye bye to the sheiks.
2714 2018-10-18 19:28:36 @LizMacDonaldFOX Do you believe there is a war between the bankers and oil producers? Over the control of money>
2715 2018-10-18 19:28:24 There are reasons to question our degree of involvement in the middle east. Israel, can truly defend itself (the best army in the region and about 200 nuclear weapons). The rest of the area is not nearly as important in a world where oil is less important (but abundant).
2716 2018-10-18 19:28:21  That’s that deep cry that also puts you to sleep. Peppermint oil is great for that. 
2717 2018-10-18 19:28:15 Correlation=/=causation. Global oil prices fluctuate. They skyrocketed under Obama. Does that make them Obama's fault? California's gas prices are what they are because producers must make a CALIFORNIA ONLY blend. What we, as voters and taxpayers can control, is the gas tax.
2718 2018-10-18 19:28:06 me: in cars how is there a pregnant car? 
hunter: well honey,,,, when two cars love each other very much....they get together and share oil..
2719 2018-10-18 19:28:02  that makes them wiser than alleged. If they can sacrifice beer for cooking oil
2720 2018-10-18 19:28:00 If I get to do another oil retaining ring on a transfer box it will be too soon. Brand new, OEM and unround as a pear.
2721 2018-10-18 19:27:57 Well take out the okro, onions, pepper and stew, add veg.oil and tshirts. Convert 500 naira  to a range of Ghc 2 - 50, and you'll have Ghana in the mix.
2722 2018-10-18 19:27:54 Is data the new oil?
2723 2018-10-18 19:27:46 Coconut  oil is life.
2724 2018-10-18 19:27:42 American establishment has got no morals, Let there be no confusion/doubt about that. They are resorting to arm-twisting tactics with KSA to force kingdom to produce more oil, so that they can lower the oil prices before the mid term elections in Nov.
2725 2018-10-18 19:27:41 Why do you think all these Arab states are looking to diversify their economic portfolios? Davos in the Desert is happening because the Saudis know if they lean entirely on oil for comparative advantage in the market, it won't be economically feasible
2726 2018-10-18 19:27:40 Exactly they're not Faith leaders they are snake oil salesman who use Christianity as a shield and a weapon, to line their pockets oh, and push the radical racist and misogynistic agenda

2728 2018-10-18 19:27:30 so i put tea tree oil on my face instead and no burning sensation so at least theres that hahaha my body is a mess it’s so annoying hahah
2729 2018-10-18 19:27:29 Dems have convinced base that somehow these people competing for same resources are a benefit. They pay more in taxes, give me your tired........ we are a country of immigrants.......
It's a low information and emotional thing
2730 2018-10-18 19:27:25 Why exactly are we friends with the Saudis and enemies of Iran?  Two Islamic theocracies which support terrorism and routinely violate human rights that both have a lot of oil.  I really don't get it.
2731 2018-10-18 19:27:23 لا كنت نفس الطول بس كنت قلبوظه اكتر 
2732 2018-10-18 19:27:16 Land ownership in China is nationalized,go check out their investment grade...the Venezuela scarecrow is tiring,crisis is due to over reliance on oil export revenue + poor spending habits in boom times plus impact of sanctions,can’t see correlation?
2733 2018-10-18 19:27:09 Get the bingo machine ready. Can the LG draft one of the wee timorous beasties to be Speaker?
2734 2018-10-18 19:27:03 Russia's economy is a glorified oil state. He is talking out of his ass.
2735 2018-10-18 19:26:58 Lol Alex Jones also says Sandy Hook was a false flag, you believe that one to? How about we talk about Fred Koch and how he made the money his sons use to buy your politicians? Ding ding ding, Nazi oil refineries!!

2738 2018-10-18 19:26:52 I remember when a bunch of Saudis hijacked and flew planes into US buildings killing almost 3k people and we retaliated by invading Afghanistan and Iraq and then sold arms to Saudi Arabia.
Oil and money has always been worth more than American's blood.
2739 2018-10-18 19:26:51 Do you imagine IF it would have happened in Venezuela? The country that the US´s attacks non stop(for the last 20 years) because they have the LARGEST OIL RESERVE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. Of course, the US will have use it as THE EXCUSE they need to FINALLY launch a WAR in Venezuela.

2743 2018-10-18 19:26:45 CO2 is green and allows more oil to be extracted from old wells at lower energy use
2744 2018-10-18 19:26:43 Sure taxes is part of it lol. Global oil prices are still set by supply and demand and US consumption isnt going down so if we 86 opec what happens to the supply?
2745 2018-10-18 19:26:35 @Alchemist yo, when you make a sandwich, do you put the oil and vinegar on the bread or the lettuce fam?
2746 2018-10-18 19:26:33 

Missoula built a 5M footbridge so big rig oil equipment couldn't drive through town to the interstate.
2747 2018-10-18 19:26:28  I go carry anointing oil all come make you no fear
2748 2018-10-18 19:26:24 NAOMI, YOU ARE NAIVE, DEMS TAKE FROM THE SAME FOSSIL FUELERS AS GOP. THEY ARE CORRUPT WEAK TUBS OF OIL.
2749 2018-10-18 19:26:24 We just shouldn't do it for pennies on the dollar. US gets the benefits of the oil we get shit jobs and mercenary work. Not even a bone when we really need the help. Why should we protect these bastards let the US do it,or take over Saudia. We do it regularly nothing new btw.
2750 2018-10-18 19:26:09 In Psalm 23 David writes, “You have already indicated your feeling toward me by anointing my head with oil.” Even before the treaty is signed you approved, accepted and delighted in me.
2751 2018-10-18 19:26:03 For engine oil, do you fellows use a specific break-in, mineral-based multigrade blend? Do you plan to operate it using a monograde? (Just curious)

No excessive smoke at startup. Short clip showed a promising idle. Sure wish I was there...!
2752 2018-10-18 19:26:02 Do you use palm oil from verifiable sources?
2753 2018-10-18 19:25:52 I wonder if anyone's done a long-term analysis of the cost and energy yield per acre (averaged out world wide) of a oil field vs a wind farm? Anyone know? Many factors, eg initial cost, maint. replacement of equipment etc.
2754 2018-10-18 19:25:43 Well no. Cause as other larger producers like the United State, Venezuela, and Russia have made the total volume of oil produced and available so versatile that the contribution of OPEC is not enough to move the market
2755 2018-10-18 19:25:25 And the sun. And the red wine and the olive oil. And the Public Health System, of course.
2756 2018-10-18 19:25:21 She was saying that sativa and Indica dominate strains would have the same effect given their estimated THC percentage was relatively high, like in oil extract (%70-%80) thc. But even then I don’t agree with that. I always notice a significant difference in the feeling of the
2757 2018-10-18 19:24:49 @realDonaldTrump @jaredkushner The US should reconsider our diplomatic/military ties w/ @RoyalSaudiNews. The US doesn't need SaudiArabia as much as SaudiArabia needs the US. Stop all Arms Deals, Impose Oil Embargo, Demand Civil Rights reforms, Reform their version
2758 2018-10-18 19:24:43 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
2759 2018-10-18 19:24:41 Great piece.  It’s true.  Water is the new oil.   Also one reason Israel is of interest to Arab partners. Water.

2766 2018-10-18 19:23:55 Tax breaks or cuts for all businesses are NOT subsidies for oil & gas. Any subsidies given to the industry pale in comparison to "renewable" mandates, ethanol mandates, and tax credits. No such thing exists for oil & gas.

2770 2018-10-18 19:23:39 Oil is not a single molecule. It (along with Natural Gas) is a composition of 100's of different hydrocarbon molecules.
2771 2018-10-18 19:23:34 @AudreyNGoodson just sent an e - would love for you could to join us @Make Believe @7pm tonite to meet working mom Dr. Millie Hernandez, the 1st MD to launch a completely organic CBD oil skincare line! cocktails and samples of the product for all! tweet me if you want to come! :)
2772 2018-10-18 19:23:29 I saw a bloke putting cod liver oil tablets in his spliff!!  He said it makes his joints better
2773 2018-10-18 19:23:23 Just make sure your ratios are right : 80% fat, 15% protein, 5% sugar. Natural butter and coconut oil is your new homie,  Gin Has the least sugar if you decide to cheat while out.
2774 2018-10-18 19:23:11 Potato croquettes are the supreme vegan food: flavorful, crispy, and dripping with oil just like real food.
2775 2018-10-18 19:22:49 The one I buy has a slight rose smell and it makes my skin oil free and clean =)

2780 2018-10-18 19:22:22 Here's another great fall aroma for your essential oil diffuser:

Evening by the fire

3 drops Douglas fir
3 drops Frankincense
2 drops Sandalwood
2 drops Lavender
4 drops Wild orange
2781 2018-10-18 19:22:11 Guys, we all know Saudi Arabia murdered the man. What ya’ll don’t get is the US just CAN’T do anything about it, it’s not about Trump. Financial markets are already fucked up and any sanctions will lead to SA raising oil prices, leading to economic disaster. Hands are tied
2782 2018-10-18 19:22:00 They are by coming here. Turning non productive hondurans into productive ones, contributing many times more to home econ than they would ever do otherwise and we cover all social costs. Honduras has 0 expense
2783 2018-10-18 19:22:00 argan oil *FROM morocco jesus christ get some education.
2784 2018-10-18 19:21:59 Oil, gas and fossil fuels are a world wide commodity. Regulating extraction in Canada does nothing for extraction in Australia or the Middle East.
2785 2018-10-18 19:21:56 @JRsBBQ what was fish oil that sponsored your podcast?
2786 2018-10-18 19:21:51 Thought they weren't supposed to talk about oil price anymore. That lasted long.
2787 2018-10-18 19:21:44 Looks like a contact reaction to something rather than a reaction to something ingested which would generally appear on the trunk of the body. New scarf? New high necked top? New fabric conditioner? Try a little 2 drops teatree oil in a carrier oil. Massage into area
2788 2018-10-18 19:21:38 DRAMATIC change in one dog. A little terrier mix, rescue, timid and showed fear aggression. He was always so upset at everything, barking, losing focus and lunging at everything! CBD oil calmed this little fella down so he could sit, lay down, walk on leash. Changed his life!
2789 2018-10-18 19:21:30 @realDonaldTrump says there are scientists on both sides of the climate change 'debate'. Yes. The 99% who do real research and the 1% who take the dirty money of the oil & coal lobbies #ClimateChaos #ClimateEmergency
2790 2018-10-18 19:21:28 

...Big Oil's air pollution, is Big Oil's mess to clean up, not the taxpayers of Washington. #ClimateReality #YESon1631
2791 2018-10-18 19:21:22 Tried so many different diets from Keto to paleo to intermittent fasting. What I have found works the best FOR ME is moderate protein and carbs with low fat. With the fat intake from avocado, nuts, salmon, olive or coconut oil etc. caloric defect if fat loss is main goal
2792 2018-10-18 19:21:21 I just made the mistake of grocery shopping while hungry. 

Secondly and most importantly, if vegetables are sooooooooooooooo good for you, then why is vegetable oil SO unhealthy and full of calories?? Huh!? Answer me THAT, science.
2793 2018-10-18 19:21:21 Well, since you asked, if we supported renewables at the same level we subsidize oil & gas, we could easily be energy independent with our domestic supply and renewables. No need for oil, no need to be complicit w/repressive regimes. Support democracies w/Free press, equal rights
2794 2018-10-18 19:21:20 @Budget I rented a car from you this morning & the check oil light was on. I reported it to the office but they told me to ignore it. Kind of concerning.
2795 2018-10-18 19:21:09 What about cannabis oil? Ever tried it?
2796 2018-10-18 19:20:43 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
2797 2018-10-18 19:20:28 Things I've said to my animals today:

It's a beautiful day, go, run, pee.

You know you have it good when you haven't done laundry in forever and still find a good fitting pair of underwear. 

I bet John Wayne would have loved garlic flavored olive oil.

2799 2018-10-18 19:20:23 Ugh I feel like an old lady today  I was told this fish oil would help inflammation 
2800 2018-10-18 19:20:15 Interesting article. From my reading of the article it is still considered true that some oil was produced from decaying plants and animals, but is saying oil was also produced by chemical reactions at high temperature and pressure from inorganic materials.
2801 2018-10-18 19:20:15 They're not lmao. Their size doesn't actually change, only their appearance. Skin tends to be drier over the winter, which can result in less oil clogging your pores = smaller looking pores.
2802 2018-10-18 19:20:13 Need to find someone who can do a good Vaudeville Snake Oil Carnival Barker type voice to do my alerts I think. What with the steampunk aesthetic, and my love of old school shill... I think it would be a good fit.
2803 2018-10-18 19:20:11 I love it for my oily skin. It sounds weird but it dissolves the oil without overdrying.
2804 2018-10-18 19:20:09 Sorry - hardy cruelty - free when you continue to use palm oil .
2805 2018-10-18 19:20:00 Want a strigil and some olive oil? Meanwhile, predictably, I am "Somewhere, in space, this could all be happening right now." which is really a terrible, terrible tagline for that movie, but...
2806 2018-10-18 19:19:52 i've tried every oil in the book, argon, coconut, moroccan, but my tried and true has definitely been castor oil for my hair 
it's the cat's pajamas
2807 2018-10-18 19:19:50 I got my oil changed, cleaned out my car AND vacuumed it. I feel productive as fuck.
2808 2018-10-18 19:19:49 thank god cbd oil is legal now because I just asked a question during my lecture and my hands started shaking lmao a damn mess
2809 2018-10-18 19:19:43 You're living in a dream world if you think a drop in Saudi production will not drastically affect the price of oil.
2810 2018-10-18 19:19:17 Fuck The Apprentice, I Was Gonna Bake you Fresh Bread w/ Olive Oil & Balsamic Vinegar
2811 2018-10-18 19:19:06 OMG, I can't be doing furry tongue
2812 2018-10-18 19:19:06 This one always makes noise in rounds of four, and the best way to describe it is it sounds like trampoline springs in need of some oil
2813 2018-10-18 19:18:58 引火したら、もう手遅れさ…
2814 2018-10-18 19:18:53 I am fully supportive of vegan cheese but FFS it needs a rebrand. 

1. Stop calling it cheese 
2. "Coconut oil alternative to cheddar" isn't going to make anyone swoon
3. Hide it behind better packaging
4. Just call it savoury joy  

And yes, I want food to make me swoon.
2815 2018-10-18 19:18:51 The expectation that you will know something about cars, particularly when they won't work. Even putting oil in it requires me looking at the manual, checking the manual again, and then coming back from the car to have another read just to be sure.
2816 2018-10-18 19:18:46 And then Robertson added, "The Romans HAD to brutally execute Jesus because he was putting all these ideas in the Jews' heads and the work slowed down and Caesar wasn't getting his delivery of textiles, vino and olive oil on time! Christ! He shoulda kept his mouth shut!"
2817 2018-10-18 19:18:46 There is another vegetable oil manufacturer on the mainland that sells imported oil labelled as locally produced. An employee there said so. I don't know if they get any exemptions though.
2818 2018-10-18 19:18:44 And it works extremely well in Europe.

From the mid 30’s to the late 50’s, the US had a fantastic rail/bus system as well. It moved people in a timely way. This went away when the US Oil Companies, Auto Companies, & politicians started to get together.
2819 2018-10-18 19:18:44 @sagesmokedhamm I think I found something that beats your pumpkin spice burger...I just passed a sign that said “it’s back pumpkin spice oil change!” 
2820 2018-10-18 19:18:43 LOL...the budget deficit that you exploded would argue otherwise.  Snake Oil salesman selling more snake oil.  Here's hoping you're unemployed soon so we can get this country back on track.
2821 2018-10-18 19:18:41 Maybe everyone will forget about it, eh birdbrain?  Because of your anti-free press behavior, your pals are testing you to see what they can get away with.  Now you wanna call up the military to close the border?  Snake oil!
2822 2018-10-18 19:18:39 right, next time when we say Oil will Fall believe us.But  again, since the world is just another herd, let us mess with thinking
2823 2018-10-18 19:18:36 It's an attempt to overwhelm and collapse the system. No way we can house, process 20 or 30,000 people a month.
Most are let go and end up in the interior never heard from again.
2824 2018-10-18 19:18:36 That’s a positive step but I still won’t buy your products until you stop using palm oil.
2825 2018-10-18 19:18:28 I use rose oil for my face and it’s been making my skin so soft and helping my breakouts
2826 2018-10-18 19:18:25  DO NOT use coconut oil on your face! @lizzo Was being hyperbolic you should NOT put coconut oil on your everything! It too heavy for those small pores. It should be used to seal in moisture i.e. there must be moisture to begin with in your skin or hair to seal in.
2827 2018-10-18 19:18:20 I was telling my parents I bought this oil that enhances your pheromones and my step dad goes “ your pheromones already enhanced, how you think you ended up with Aria and soon another “ ... k
2828 2018-10-18 19:18:16 I wonder why the guy who orchestrated a $100 billion dollar arms deal alongside a massive $300 billion dollar investment into the Saudis oil production operation would hope the outrage would simply 'go away', Jake?
2829 2018-10-18 19:17:53 @carlbildt 

Antar att du inte vill uttala dig om misstankarna mot Lundin Oil som publicerats i dag. Eller?
2830 2018-10-18 19:17:47 Amen... Amen...
2831 2018-10-18 19:17:46 Can somebody take my car to get a oil change.!??? I have my own money 
2832 2018-10-18 19:17:43 come on then...lets be seeing mr chitts
2833 2018-10-18 19:17:43 @ShepSmithNews @FoxNews just fyi Qatar, Doha, Iran ARE WORSE/about same as SA. YET #ClintonFoundation TOOK MILLIONS from these nations. US dependency on #Oil POSES a dilemma when human rights are violated. US has given billions to Iran under #obama admin.
2834 2018-10-18 19:17:36 What benefit are they to the US? They are way worse than Iran is now. We dont need a check on Iran anymore. We need a check on Saudi Arabia.

We can get oil elsewhere, plus we need to move our power plants away from fossile fuels anyways.

The arms sales dont many create jobs tbh
2835 2018-10-18 19:17:36 Saudi Arabia has been run by murderous and corrupt thugs ever since oil was found under the desert. Why are people only acting surprised now? The evidence has been all around us for decades. Besides, where did most of the 9/11 guys come from? We are such idiots in the West.
2836 2018-10-18 19:17:34 Baby oil removes the makeup you had on
2837 2018-10-18 19:17:23 Chef Gusteau cut up some Pikmin, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was some live hornets, along with cheese.
2838 2018-10-18 19:17:06 It should not take 2-3 hours to get my oil changed wtf Toyota 
2839 2018-10-18 19:17:00 If logistics for Saudi air force stops, a lot of money will be lost and price of oil will increase.
2840 2018-10-18 19:16:48 Vit. E oil or anything with hyaluronic acid as an ingredient
2841 2018-10-18 19:16:47 And the result? Disillusionment with the same old choice between two unpalatable options until someone comes along with a bunch of snake oil (easy answers which appeal to those who feel overlooked) and TRUMPS them both. Not a good road :(
2842 2018-10-18 19:16:44 I didn't believe the science when it was first reported as the work done was sketchy.
These last few years the evidence is overwhelming that man made climate change exists and needs our urgent attention but of course if your mates in coal and oil want to ignore it you'll deny it.
2843 2018-10-18 19:16:44 When cannabis oil hits
2844 2018-10-18 19:16:43 A large portion of our crude oil comes from Saudi Arabia. It's pretty easy to say not be reliant on them but the fact remains we have to do business with them. We do currently have no other cost effective ways around it. So yes.... Still nuanced.
2845 2018-10-18 19:16:40 Nymex Settles 10/18/18 - CL Nov18: 68.65 (-1.10) (-3.3% vs Last Week) #nymex #wti #oil
2846 2018-10-18 19:16:32 Mixing everything up, dude! I’m stating the obvious. Pick up a world history book. Major US economic booms in the past 400 years: tobacco, cotton, finance, oil & software. Saudi history in the past 1,400 years: religious wars, past 100 years: oil (also made possible by the West).
2847 2018-10-18 19:16:28 Med students - we need more citizen Doctors - an aging population.  Weapon sales - major moral compromise. Oil, we have our own and prices go up is good for  Western Canada. If anything they are a competitor that barely buys Canadian. Where is the need for Saudi Arabia?
2848 2018-10-18 19:16:24 Wow think about that $10 dollar tax in a barrel of oil,  then on top of that state tax , federal tax, local tax at the pump!
2849 2018-10-18 19:16:00 How can PETA support dove, when their use of palm oil contributes to the destruction of habitat and the death of countless native species. I would call that animal cruelty!!!
2850 2018-10-18 19:15:58 goes perfect with the aldi brand olive oil and rosemary triscuits

2854 2018-10-18 19:15:41 They legally cant. In reality sending the national guard just freed up more resources to give people a ride and make the final miles less arduous

2856 2018-10-18 19:15:28 We are able to drive our gas guzzling vehicles everyday because we get our oil from who... in a perfect world I wouldn't have the event either but don't see people boycotting driving.
2857 2018-10-18 19:15:27 If i break your heart, na oil spillage.
2858 2018-10-18 19:15:27 Sure let's have a mid-day allergic reaction to the essential oil diffuser.  GREAT!
2859 2018-10-18 19:15:20 Long ago, in the days of Benny Hinn's fake healing and Kenneth Copeland selling sweaty napkins, I learned these people are snake oil salesmen.

2861 2018-10-18 19:15:07 “America”won’t be investigating anything because as Trump said almost right away after the Khashoggi story came out “it was a rogue operation” -that’s the “Deep State” line to protect their Saudi ally, whose oil props up the dollar & whose cooperation w/Israel in the ME is needed
2862 2018-10-18 19:14:59 They'll sweep it under the rug...They have too much to lose i.e oil.

2868 2018-10-18 19:14:09 The only reason Saudi Arabia considers the USA an “ally” is b/c we share the same animosity towards Iran. Not because we share the same values for humanity. The only reason the USA considers Saudi Arabia an “ally” is b/c they are a major military consumer & oil provider. Blood $

2875 2018-10-18 19:13:47 Bernice could do with a hot oil or some such treatment on her own hair. It’s looking increasingly dry and ‘split endy ‘Maybe these sudden surges of oestrogen aren’t good for her.#Emmerdale
2876 2018-10-18 19:13:46 I walked into a gun store after school, and a young lady working there came over to greet me, and said that I smelled good and wanted to know what cologne I was wearing. I told her it was carb cleaner, gasoline, a small amount of fork oil, engine oil 
2877 2018-10-18 19:13:42 A couple of evenings ago I splashed hot oil on my thumb as I was putting a piece of liver in the pan. There is a blister which started near the nail and a bit toward the side. Now it has extended past the knuckle.
2878 2018-10-18 19:13:06 I accidentally splashed hot oil on me and now it really stings but I have no ointment :(
2879 2018-10-18 19:13:03 Five reasons Saudi Arabia matters to the West.
1 - Oil
2 - Oil
3 - Buy a shit load of military tech
4 - Buy even more military tech
5 - Oil

2881 2018-10-18 19:12:58 they're a cartoonishly evil regime and the only reason we deal with them is because of oil. our military bases in KSA are the most significant reason Al Qaeda turned on America in the first place. our entanglements there have already done tremendous damage.

2884 2018-10-18 19:12:54 @Thom_Hartmann It’s sickening that our country kisses the rear of the Saudis in the interest of oil and the expansion of private wealth.  We don’t need oil and Tesla, among others, have proved it.
2885 2018-10-18 19:12:52 Castor oil for eyelashes!! But you should take some biotin!!!
2886 2018-10-18 19:12:52 Naw homie got jerked, someone got him on a high interest loan. Ain’t no way the free oil changes and tire rotations are going to add up for that.

2888 2018-10-18 19:12:25 What about palm oil? Going to stop farming it unsustainably with Wilmar and save a few orangutans in the process? Or are they not beautiful enough for you? #realbeautyiscrueltyfree
2889 2018-10-18 19:12:23 i honestly didnt have an opinion on chia before he was with the oil. TMac ive always thought was a smart coach and would be perfect for edm. much farther to erode indeed

2891 2018-10-18 19:12:03 There's just been a bit of bother in the lane. An oil tanker couldn't get past some strange BMW that was parked and he sounded his horn !!! That'll be in Parish thingy next week! Outsiders causing mayhem at 8 o'clock at night . Fred was in the lane without his cap on !!!
2892 2018-10-18 19:12:01 I've realized that I love the power of ammonia. It seems to clean better than bleach. Gets oil stains out of clothes better too. Kills mold. And gets rid of hard water deposits.  Just hate that smell!!
2893 2018-10-18 19:12:00 Most jarred mayo IS made with soybean oil. That's the whole problem. Most soy is Genetically modified, which means you're eating roundup.
2894 2018-10-18 19:11:58 Oil has saved more lives than any other product ever, without hundreds of millions would have died.
2895 2018-10-18 19:11:55 What do u really know about a nation diversifying? Is Naija an example of such? The dependence on oil is higher than ever bro. Be ye  not deceived.
2896 2018-10-18 19:11:45 Once went to a strip club in PE! 

I’m telling you man, Maritjie did the damn thing. She lunricated the floor with baby oil and slid all over the place! Gaaaawd damn!

2900 2018-10-18 19:11:14 you suggest the president do? We cant declare war on a country for executing one of their citizens. Sanctions would do nothing because they are the richest oil country in the world. So what do you want the president to do? Come out publicly, without actual evidence, and accuse
2901 2018-10-18 19:11:10 Sending the military in any form is useless. 
I suppose they can give them a ride after they set one toe on U.S soil.
Catch and release is alive and well, most of the public are just not aware years from now majority will still be here.

2904 2018-10-18 19:11:00 Just explain the price of oil has gone up and the kiwi dollar had hit an all time low, plus interest rates are on the rise
2905 2018-10-18 19:10:44 Their political and financial motivation is aligned with oil companies. But even today, oil companies recognize climate change is real, and simply fund political campaigns to keep the status quo. What would convince you that climate change is real at this point?
2906 2018-10-18 19:10:33 I shit you not they spent the next 4 minutes going “find that misthios!” And like....no my dudes, your guy was just too stupid to move away from an oil lamp. No-one even saw me arrive on this island 90 seconds ago.

2930 2018-10-18 19:09:03 Really where did you live. People start losing their job left and right. Don’t forget the market crashed in 2008. In 2009 everyone was going crazy. Obama became president and had to deal with crap Bush put us all through. Bush was all about the oil companies.
2931 2018-10-18 19:09:01 Use coconut oil. Payaz ka pani nikal k lagaya kro. Cod liver capsule khaya kro. These will help a lot in hairfall
2932 2018-10-18 19:09:00 Sec'y Pompeo's statement today about having a close relationship with the Saudis is nothing but horse crap.  The relationship was strictly a quid pro quo, & we overthrew a truly democratic administration so U.S. corps could get to their oil.  @ShepNewsTeam
2933 2018-10-18 19:08:52 Oil of oregano. Vitamin C. Echinacea. Vitamin D. Get on that asap

2936 2018-10-18 19:08:49 Unfortunately, reality looks like that , oil clubs and Premier Leagues tv contracts has fu*ked the market totally , thats why we changed our transfer policy to young talents instead of Galácticos.
2937 2018-10-18 19:08:43 If you still think it is about "oil addiction" you have not understood.

2942 2018-10-18 19:08:18 It's your boy,  uh Mozarella oil that's reading Infinite Jest
2943 2018-10-18 19:08:16 Good idea, it could generate more money for the military as well and stick it hard to libtarded states like Washington, Oregon and Commiefornia that think they can stop our exports of coal and oil to try and hurt the Trump economy.
2944 2018-10-18 19:08:15 2 oil companies, $VZ and don't remember the last one
2945 2018-10-18 19:08:15 Our leaders allegiance to the House Of Saud just reinforces the belief our addiction to oil and reliance on OPEC clouds our judgment and allows us to turn a blind eye to human right violations from the M.E.

2947 2018-10-18 19:08:09 Since extreme wealthy seem to be suggesting that everyone else be degendered and sterilised for the good of the Earth....#transcult 

Better ideas for same;

Keep it in the ground (4-7 yrs to cease all oil/gas production)
Ban cars from planet (currently 2 billion of them)
..cont.
2948 2018-10-18 19:08:03 There is only one way out of US empire and the morally untenable foreign entanglements that have embroiled the world in constant war, kept the US economy mired in Military Keynesianism and set the whole planet on a collision course with nature ... and that's the end of oil.

2954 2018-10-18 19:07:46 Why is it funny that I shop around? Also I'd much rather just make the oil myself so I know what herb is going into it and I'm not paying for someone else's time... being disabled I have lots of time but not much $...  but I'll give them a shout and see what they offer. Thanks.

2957 2018-10-18 19:07:32 Use oil-based products. Oil cleansers, facial oils etc. Your skin produces oil because it doesn’t have enough. So when you give it some, it’ll reduce its production of oil.
2958 2018-10-18 19:07:25 Years ago I had this problem at your age bypassing my teens without bubble heads. He told me to not use anything other than a hot wash towel and he was right. In two days it all went away! It strips excess oil away while opening the pores releasing the gunk. Try it.
2959 2018-10-18 19:07:18 this oil change and ole miss finna break me 
2960 2018-10-18 19:07:17 Renewable energy means never having to make nice with murderous regimes who have oil.

2968 2018-10-18 19:06:34 This black eye on Saudi Arabia is just another glowing reason to become oil energy-independent in the United States. That way they can't hold that over us if we put sanctions on them.

2977 2018-10-18 19:05:49 Nemam objašnjenje zašto sam "marula oil" na deklaraciji pročitala kao marihuana

2979 2018-10-18 19:05:37 Diversified to Which Agriculture? Find out properly if the country actually diversified from “oil” to “agriculture”. What do I know about AGRO based businesses? Smh

2981 2018-10-18 19:05:33 Allah ya jikanshi da rahama
2982 2018-10-18 19:05:30 I know all of those things are made from oil. It's Blood Money because we are doing business with (and legitimizing) a country that executed 9/11, is killing millions of people in Yemen and killing dissidents and other citizens who have allegedly broken minor rules.
2983 2018-10-18 19:05:26 Wonder if Canada can wrap up the pipeline decision fast. How long to build? Saudi's have us by the 'oil' and trump needs financial backing. Are we screwed? Damn I hate this mess!
2984 2018-10-18 19:05:23 Hands smell like sport ‘n wave and oil sheen lol
2985 2018-10-18 19:05:12 Kushner is cynical. He knows that the US is too hooked on Saudi oil to make uncomfortable decisions now. Plus the Saudis own considerable US debt and $$. Comfortable life in the US wins over punishing another spoilt brat who's grown into a mad man is what evil Jared is betting on
2986 2018-10-18 19:05:01 @MBuhari campaigned on 3 major issue,corruption,security & d economics.i knw 4 sure abj roads re free now,civil servants re well paid,30% was budgeted 4 capital expenditure for the first time in history.I cant recollect what obj/gej promised,but i can recollect d oil prices.

2988 2018-10-18 19:04:53 So you're fine with #KSA killing off people as long as they supply oil. Gotcha.
#Whataboutism? Really? Iran and Pakistan both are Islamic republics. KSA too but that's the kind no one wants to mess with apparently. Including USMC. Lol.

2997 2018-10-18 19:04:14 *Carbs. 

Low carb is only safe if your source of fats/oils and proteins is plant based: kamande, ndengu, yellow peas, split peas, red peas, black turtle beans,coconut oil, peanuts, cashew nuts. 

Trouble is most folks doing high protein from  meat.

3002 2018-10-18 19:03:27 Corn and other biofuels aren't exactly what I was referring to.

Many renewable energy sources are becoming cheaper for electricity production than coal, so oil independence as far as transportation goes would be strongly correlated with widespread use of electric vehicles.
3003 2018-10-18 19:03:22 Ah what be rich abt oil change... u no dey do oil change?

3008 2018-10-18 19:02:56 He already gets boo’d like crazy. A heel turn only makes sense. As for the rest of it, I don’t think our $9.99/mo subscriptions compare with the millions in oil money they’re getting for ppv events over there. I don’t pay for wwe anyway so...
3009 2018-10-18 19:02:54 Read the history carefully and then you will have a great opinion why US & Saudi relationship is Special.
Regardless Oil & Weapons , there is a hidden reason which related to Islam "Makkah & Madina" 
Avoid you emotions and dont down grade this reason.
3010 2018-10-18 19:02:41 All players want to the club , yes absolutely but only at reasonable prices. Real are not like the oil clubs but need to balance everything. Santiago Bernabéu needs renovation for € 525 million with the club's own money , They have lost sponsors as epic to cover costs etc.

3024 2018-10-18 19:01:29 Beto wants to raise taxes, including $10 for every barrel of crude oil.  He might have a chance even with the social stuff, but raising taxes is a no no in Texas.  Beto has no chance of winning this race in business friendly Texas because of his stance on taxes and regulations.

3029 2018-10-18 19:01:15 This old snake oil salesman’s been spewing his hateful politics for decades now while getting to do it totally TAX FREE.
3030 2018-10-18 19:01:13 it's the only reasonable conclusion tho, no other object can conjure olive oil

3046 2018-10-18 19:00:01 It happens to me when my anxiety goes high too. PLEASE look into Maca. It has helped me so much. Look into CBC oil also.
3047 2018-10-18 19:00:01 It's so heckin simple why don't we just go and burn all the oil we got left in the planet that way people will be forced to use greener alternatives hello???

I just solved literally everything you're welcome

3054 2018-10-18 18:59:28 But yes- the oil prices are being artificially inflated, which honestly will help out many Americans who have royalties, and provides thousands, and thousands of jobs for our country. Rick Perry was a genius energy pick.
3055 2018-10-18 18:59:16 Who can come to me asap an do a oil change?? Off missouri ave
3056 2018-10-18 18:59:16 Would seem a story they could spin against Trump war on media/enemy of the people, if attacker white.
Reality is, they will suppress. Reinforces forbidden idea ppl other than whites can be racist and he may be a causality of anti white rhetoric
3057 2018-10-18 18:59:16 Definetly mate. Goes on like an oil and finishes like it too just no smell and yellowing. Great work.
3058 2018-10-18 18:59:07 Amazing but please ditch the palm oil 
3059 2018-10-18 18:59:06 Fair, although “nationalize the oil industry because it will be so inefficient it’ll tank and destroy your national economy with it” is maybe not the best foot forward for socialism as a concept…
3060 2018-10-18 18:59:06 African black soap for a cleanser & either sweet almond oil or recently I’ve started up on cocoa butter!
3061 2018-10-18 18:59:05 but if you wanna use rose hip oil get it 100% pure not any of that diluted shit, weird little “health” stores have the best ones
3062 2018-10-18 18:58:55 My concern is that Mental Illness already has a stigma. The CCHR is working hard to set us back to the days of Bedlam. Telling desperate parents that ADHD isn’t real or pushing dangerous snake oil treatments to “cure” autism is criminal. They need to be stopped.
3063 2018-10-18 18:58:55 #Germany & #Italy imported Syrian products last year worth a modest $13 million (US). In terms of trade ties, including past oil supplies, & cooperation, #Syria enjoyed better relations historically with these 2 top 4 #EU countries than it did with the other 2 #Britain & #France.
3064 2018-10-18 18:58:54 The only oils her hair liked was olive oil & argan
3065 2018-10-18 18:58:52 Just found out the little Cornish headshop where I had my 1st job is now one of the leading CBD oil distributors in the UK helmed by the owner's son who took me under his wing like a stoned angel when I was a wayward 16yr old & honestly I couldn't be prouder.
3066 2018-10-18 18:58:35 I wonder if Bush had people raise money for his campaign? He was rich right? I thought they had an oil business or invested in one? For that matter did he have business when he was president?? For that matter didn't we go to war w a country with lots of oil?? I think I'm wrong..
3067 2018-10-18 18:58:25 is olive oil is basically freshly squeezed oliver?
3068 2018-10-18 18:58:21 Ameen
3069 2018-10-18 18:58:10 Because Saudi Arabia is in mid East with oil and buys our arms and the other is Russia with gas for Germany and arms for Syria....
3070 2018-10-18 18:58:09 This has more to do with real estate deals and #BlackMoney than politics
3071 2018-10-18 18:58:08 Didn't you just call MBS last week and had a pissyfit about oil prices? Then he told you to stick it. I think you have a lot more understanding about Khashoggi's murder...
3072 2018-10-18 18:57:54 Government came to the rescue. Flaunting 3 bags of Rice and 20 litre groundnut oil
3073 2018-10-18 18:57:52 The bottle of apple juice and the bottle of olive oil were right next to each other and you can take a guess of which one I almost drank
3074 2018-10-18 18:57:30 Riding and leaking oil on the garage floor lol
3075 2018-10-18 18:57:29 How does an oil and fluid change turn into a $2300 bill??



Playing with my emotions

Thanks but no thanks!!!

3077 2018-10-18 18:57:20 Biden coddles Poroshenko of Ukraine with racketeering in shady oil deals, I hope he runs for 2020 this will be exposed.
3078 2018-10-18 18:57:02 @realDonaldTrump Don't build a wall just annex Mexico let the IRS deal with the cartels and have more of the Gulf to drill for oil!
3079 2018-10-18 18:57:00 Okay I’ve heard good things about her! But yes a girl I know gets her lashes from her and says coconut oil takes them right off
3080 2018-10-18 18:56:56 is congress trying to get some BSP high ranker to hit-and-miss on gandi-family ???? for 5+2019 ?
3081 2018-10-18 18:56:53 Keep in mind I said "energy industry," not "oil industry." After all, we're talking about whether or not these people have the expertise and motivation to make the necessary transition.

3083 2018-10-18 18:56:28 No I don’t think so. Oil, masque and lifting powder
3084 2018-10-18 18:56:23 You make a point. Trump thinks we need Saudi oil. Domestically, it’s not necessary. We are now the #2 petro production in the world. They need us for cover from Iran and for weapons, parts, ammunition, training, C3I for Yemen
3085 2018-10-18 18:56:23 The one on the big tray is King Triton. 
The rest her his guard. 

Sea witch octopus Ursula probably snapped the picture. 

Ariel is out there with Prince Eric and Sebastian is baby sitting her.
3086 2018-10-18 18:56:19 We were a nation invented jet engines, railways etc. Now we’re a nation of politicians, lawyers, bankers passing around papers for foreign oil lobbyists for their vested interests. Time to make Britain Great again! We should be leading EV revolution #makebritaingreat @BBCBreaking
3087 2018-10-18 18:56:09 The American President doesn't want to destroy our economy.  If we sanction Saudi Arabia, they pull back the oil and our economy tanks. Time we stopped being the World's Policeman.
3088 2018-10-18 18:55:55 That why the M1 has 7 oil pumps 
3089 2018-10-18 18:55:49 pipelines. Unfortunately for the people with a financial stake in the Canadian oil industry, the gap will remain and may even widen further despite having politicians throw more and more of our tax dollars into this unfillable pit. ...
3090 2018-10-18 18:55:47 Arabs bribe us with goodies thinking they can shove us into a corner when they cut up a journalist. I would rather go without Arab oil than have anyone sell out the integrity of our nation.  Lose our integrity and we lose our souls. Please tell Mr. Trump.
3091 2018-10-18 18:55:44 Oil stocks will crash in this weekend. Not exactly.　　石油株は今週末に暴落するだろう。いや、そうでもないよ。
3092 2018-10-18 18:55:42 No shaking jare. Drink red oil
3093 2018-10-18 18:55:41 I'm getting good enough to take requests,  but sorry, Wonderwall makes me throw up.   And the next guy who yells Free bird will be stuffed into an oil drum and rolled into the river. 
3094 2018-10-18 18:55:39 Min @jimcarr_wpg notes 99% of Cdn energy exports go to the US. But it's not evident that the gov has a strategy for oil mkt diversification/investment attraction given the failure to move forward on #TMX & the chill that #C48 & #C69 will have on foreign energy investments in Cda.
3095 2018-10-18 18:55:35 Yet, Trump wants to coal waste dumped into our streams. How many yrs did we have to fight to get clean streams? Trump is willing to allow more offshore drilling, the oil spills caused by these things are beyond bad. Such STUPIDITY from this administration!
3096 2018-10-18 18:55:30 price between WCS and WTI. With the world beginning to prepare for a reduction in C02 output it is unlikely this gap in price will ever close because the demand will never be high enough.

So yes, Alberta will sell more oil if the taxpayers are forced to pay for more...
3097 2018-10-18 18:55:26 The Oil keeps preserves your youthfulness as the years pass..
Just Saying
3098 2018-10-18 18:55:25 Palm oil - avoid unless frpm certified sustainable source. Coconut oil not as clear cut  i use it but only from organic sources and very sparingly.
3099 2018-10-18 18:55:19 Dont understand this craze for cooking oil. How much cooking oil can one household consume in a week? Opportunity for @PicknPay to educate pple about cooking methods that dont involve oil.
3100 2018-10-18 18:55:18 1 LB Ground Bison/Buffalo
1 Egg
1 small Onion, diced
Season to taste (Salt, Pepper, Garlic Powder)
Mix it together.
Form small balls.
Fry them in olive oil.
Add to pasta sauce when you pour it over the pasta.
(Used to get Bison at specialty stores, but more stores have it now.)
3101 2018-10-18 18:55:17 Hella weed and lavender oil sometimes help 
3102 2018-10-18 18:55:17 West Texas oil n gas!
3103 2018-10-18 18:55:15 Well...renewables lack infrastructure, are way too inefficient, too expensive and can actually cause more pollution (corn).

The energy efficient rare earth minerals we use for electronics come from Asia (China/RUS).
 
We already receive the majority of our oil from Canada .
3104 2018-10-18 18:55:11 That fact will weaken with time, we don’t need their oil anymore.
3105 2018-10-18 18:55:10 My life goal is to be a BP oil lifer with a 15% discount on Butter chicken pies
3106 2018-10-18 18:55:10 Economy was fully reliant on oil
Corruption was at its worst
No police reforms
No restructuring
Countries nwere refusing to have dealings with us
South Africa siezed our money
Fugitives were given presidential pardons
Job seekers were cheated by givern agencies and killed
3107 2018-10-18 18:55:09 To maximize profits, the owners turn up the taps whenever oil prices rise, then turn down the taps when the price drops. Simple economics. 

Only when most of these wells run at peak flow does our crappy bitumen have a chance at seeing a reduction of the gap in...
3108 2018-10-18 18:55:00 What’s so funny is the fact that you have a deficit because when you were in power in Alberta you gave away the oil for nothing. Why would anyone trust the #ucp to be what’s right.
3109 2018-10-18 18:54:48 Yup. They have the capacity to generate more if not that Nigeria is one kind. let Oil dry up maybe then they will invest in the ICT hub.
3110 2018-10-18 18:54:46 @PutinRF_Eng After the Saudi-Russian oil alliance, the next step is to buy Russian weapons and prevent America's monopoly of the arms market in the world
3111 2018-10-18 18:54:45 prices between WTI and WCS.

False:
           Currently there are thousands of high-quality light oil wells all over North America that are running significantly under full flow. You can partially thank the new fracking technology for this surplus. ...
3112 2018-10-18 18:54:35 You not supposed to wash your hands in the oil kev haha
3113 2018-10-18 18:54:28 so i was sitting there,, casually tryna wipe the baby oil off of the outside of my hair straightener- and then my cousin told me the shadow kinda make it look rEALlY wrong. oops.
3114 2018-10-18 18:54:20 Who the fuck still need oil???
3115 2018-10-18 18:54:13 The last thing we want is SA backs off from Billions of $ in trade with US and make a deal with China & Russia + causing oil prices rise up and destabilizing ME and europe by not confronting jihadist and terrorists, all because of a muslim brotherhood so called journalist!
3116 2018-10-18 18:54:09 So I’ve tried every single oil you can imagine on Alaia’s hair to keep it moisturized and soft

and this entire time....all I needed was some fucking water and hair grease
3117 2018-10-18 18:54:05 Oil barons don't really need Facebook.  Many businesses/independents rely on Facebook as a customer service portal, sales portal, e-commerce marketplace, talent aqustiion network, as well as countless groups, subgroups and communities overall.

Like the blog minister's statement- "Rupee has not weakened, dollar has become strong", In the coming days, no one will be surprised to hear that due to the oil price, instead of 125, only 36 #RafaleAircraft are taken

3122 2018-10-18 18:53:33 As a charger owner myself I pay 380 and oil changes are 20 bucks lmao they saw this nigga coming.
3123 2018-10-18 18:53:27 We abt to do it all! TVs, sound systems, oil changes, brakes!
3124 2018-10-18 18:53:23 So, the knight-commander... Boiling in oil? That one never gets old.
3125 2018-10-18 18:53:15 U people think I ought feel bad,over a towel head?? Riding camels to riding Catilics. Because of oil. I think it would be a nice salt flats! To race our cars.u people better wise up
3126 2018-10-18 18:52:58 Has Donald Trump cut ties with Saudi Arabia after they brutally killed Khassogi or is the Oil money too sweet to leave
3127 2018-10-18 18:52:56 my fiat 500 told me she needed an oil change i was like ok babey
3128 2018-10-18 18:52:48 Don’t get me wrong I’d prefer cbd oil over just regular juice but like dab  is where it’s at
3129 2018-10-18 18:52:35 Remember the statements when BO was Prez about the number of "created or saved jobs?" If we used identical criteria, Trump's number would be about 20 million when you count coal, oil, all energy, automotive, defense, etc. jobs!
3130 2018-10-18 18:52:34 We must tread carefully with Saudi Arabia. The 110 billion arms deal is small compared to the investments they hold in treasuries and stock. + Oil supply! If weaponized they could damage our economy. Clearly there is strife within, who is good/evil? Hard to really know...
3131 2018-10-18 18:52:29 God, idk why I straight piped it, but the guys changing the oil are having fun with it 
3132 2018-10-18 18:52:26 @sherylunderwood SO agree w/u re: weed vs. canib oil. Weed has such a negative stigma attached to it that stops people. We tried EVERYTHING 2 get the oil 4 my husband after he got cancer in '10. Info was there then. No luck living in PA. He died 7/30/15 @56

3134 2018-10-18 18:52:15 Oh please! I’m right behind starting to ban weapon sales to Saudi but don’t make out it’s just the tories, every gvt since WWI has embraced Saudi money & oil, it’s why Saudi Arabia was created! Also start condemning all other equally repulsive regimes in region

3137 2018-10-18 18:51:52 Me too! I dealt with that with my 1st car. Every time I brought my car in for an oil change, they would break something totally unrelated and I would have to pay for it. I didn’t realize what was happening till it was too late.
3138 2018-10-18 18:51:47 Hahahaaa no be lie
3139 2018-10-18 18:51:43 That’s great but what about your use of palm oil which endangers (or worse) orangutans?? Can you address this issue urgently please? @Greenpeace @GreenpeaceUK @Dove Be a leader like you were and are for women of all shapes/sizes because all lives matter, not just human ones.
3140 2018-10-18 18:51:42 @realDonaldTrump this khasshoggi business is ridiculous, they can't wait for a proper investigation is before blaming you. this has the whole world in an uproar about oil prices, and that guy was working with the muslim brotherhood to damagr the saudi regime and government

3144 2018-10-18 18:51:30 I would expect nothing less from a creep, who along with Jerry Falwell Sr. blamed 9/11 on “lesbians and abortionists” instead of noting that it was financed by Saudi oil money. Wonder what ‘ol Pat’s investment profile looks like?

3152 2018-10-18 18:51:07 Main ingredients are milk(you can even mix half-half w/water or condensed milk w/water) flower, oil(vegetable, grape seed, even olive oil ok)— experiment what you like. Crepe should be moist & golden, if not- just splash bit more oil (couple tablespoons). Oil is never too much:)
3153 2018-10-18 18:50:59 Beto wants to raise taxes, including $10 for every barrel of crude oil.  That does not go over well in Texas.  He might have a chance with the social stuff, but raising taxes is a no no in this business friendly state.
3154 2018-10-18 18:50:57 Let’s assume man-made climate change is real as you suggest. Trump is to blame for 200 years of oil, gas and coal consumption by mankind? You’re TDS has reached epic proportions.
3155 2018-10-18 18:50:51 I will admit I’m not up to date on that subject, but neither do I buy it. I do buy coconut oil for many uses.
3156 2018-10-18 18:50:38 I need to find some energy to do this oil change mann 
3157 2018-10-18 18:50:36 Still waiting for that one product before the oil... I can’t thing of any. Unless you count local camel cheese. The point is, let’s face it, Saudis screwed up. But you can always move towards progress. First thing is to acknowledge the challenges. Never too late to get started.
3158 2018-10-18 18:50:31 one of my kids just took a big old sniff out of a peppermint essential oil bottle and I was like “why?” and he looked me dead in the eyes and said “why do you think? for my stress”
3159 2018-10-18 18:50:26 I put oil in my baby hair today now she looks bald sorry baby 
3160 2018-10-18 18:50:20 Don't be surprised if Steven Mnuchin has a spine because he doesn't have one. He was pressured into leaving the conference in Riyadh. No matter what he does, he's still the same snake oil grifter.
3161 2018-10-18 18:50:06 Call landlord 2 call oil company because boiler needs 2 be serviced. He said he can have guy upstairs turn the boiler on, told him I know how 2 do that. He ask me how? I said i take off my clothes in front of boiler& it gets turn on. Guy upstairs is a idiot.
3162 2018-10-18 18:49:59 I'd be better with the weather getting colder if oil wasn't so expensive and the wall in my room let the cold air in. I need to be shipped to a warmer climate
3163 2018-10-18 18:49:58 Oh, they'd still shut up before oil prices got too much higher.

Now, if Canada killed a FOXer...

3171 2018-10-18 18:48:56 Why the heck does the US need Saudi? Go dig the oil you have or buy it from someone else. Pull all troops from the Middle East and sever the 'relationship’.

3177 2018-10-18 18:48:27 are still a bunch of anti-Semites in the far left. Moderate, Christian Dems are disappearing (becoming Ind. and fiscally weak conservatives- aka RINOs) so we’re seeing a showdown between God, and Satan right in front of us. Oil is a pawn in this game, but not the motivation, IMHO
3178 2018-10-18 18:48:24 Most Americans don’t support Saudi Arabia the place most of the 9/11 terrorists we’re radicalized and came from its guys like @realDonaldTrump @43georgebush who support them and put us all at risk by keeping us on the oil teet.

3182 2018-10-18 18:48:05 Creo que podemos hablar de 2 divisiones del ESMAD, los que tienen armadura y casco, los que tienen over oil y capucha, los segundos son la unidad de inteligencia y saboteó de movilizaciones y concentraciones pacíficas.
3183 2018-10-18 18:48:02 WHICH WORKS! everybody should use cuticle oil
3184 2018-10-18 18:48:02 At least five oil consortiums said they were considering a proposal from the state-run #Nigeria National Petroleum Corp. to prolong a crude-for-fuels swap program until the middle of next year, people familiar with the matter said.
3185 2018-10-18 18:48:00 Currently getting a Oil Change!
3186 2018-10-18 18:47:55 Don't fall for the 'we should get to buy all the SUV's we want cuz we have mountains, set our own emission standards' shtick. Stapleton is a Big Oil, Koch brothers candidate. Carbon emissions/air quality are the last thing they care about. They want you buying those gas guzzlers
3187 2018-10-18 18:47:49 Squeeze out the most we can get from oil at the detriment of the environment? Pathetic!
3188 2018-10-18 18:47:47 Please bring this to CA. Much rather have this than oil drilling any day.
3189 2018-10-18 18:47:45 How will will dollar fall 4 naira when we dont ve anything we export expect crude oil.

3196 2018-10-18 18:46:48 You might be surprised how many business lose money the first couple years.  The former Con government forgot to collect billions in oil royalties.
3197 2018-10-18 18:46:42 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.

Oil will fail, for cars
3201 2018-10-18 18:46:27 I thought we were the largest oil producer in the world. Now we’re not.
3202 2018-10-18 18:46:22 All for oil. Because we can’t stop suckling the teet of the Black crude and invest in some god damn renewable energy. 
3203 2018-10-18 18:46:14 Even if that’s true, his APR is northwards if 30% or more. Nothing to do with the tire rotations and oil changes.

3222 2018-10-18 18:43:58 I think I’m finally starting to miss being an artist again. It’s 6am and I just want to pull out my oil paints and paint.

3225 2018-10-18 18:43:46 Just Saying

I went out with a girl last night who was so black when she got out of my car, the oil light came on.

3230 2018-10-18 18:43:01 Just put olbas oil in a steamer and I think I’m going blind
3231 2018-10-18 18:42:54 My paranoid mind is beginning to wonder with the falling oil price if the US thinks the Saudis will pay for this murder by some crazy long term supply agreement.
3232 2018-10-18 18:42:48 Let me make sure I understand you correctly: you believe most oil companies don't have shareholders, and the few shareholders that do exist are experts in the energy industry?
3233 2018-10-18 18:42:47 Mad!
3234 2018-10-18 18:42:43 What makes the U.S Saudi relationship so special?  Weapons, Oil.
3235 2018-10-18 18:42:26 When you control the product that the whole world needs OIL. It seems they have  Carte Blanche to do whatever they want with no ramifications.
3236 2018-10-18 18:42:25 Crepes:mix milk,flower, eggs (2cups of milk 1-3 eggs,more better),splash about half cup grape oil.Make it about Naked Juice consistency or bit thicker.I mix ingredients as I heat up pan on high medium(put drop of oil for 1st crepe only). Add cinnamon, vanilla/orange extract,sugar
3237 2018-10-18 18:42:19 So I was only washing my face and light moisturizer but I bought some rosehip and this avocado/vit E&C oil so I’ll start using that tonight. 

Also I put my hair in a really lose pineapple and put a silk wrap on it. Freshen it up with a little water in the AM
3238 2018-10-18 18:42:18 #ffwd Time to stop arsing about with oil explorers, if I were you, and buy some #ffwd - this isn't a roll of the dice, it's proper business.
3239 2018-10-18 18:42:17 Also ended oil joint ventures with PDVSA, causing PDVSA to begin arbitration proceedings against Ecuador.
3240 2018-10-18 18:42:17 eggs and oil
3241 2018-10-18 18:42:17 Them air wick oil essential mist got my house smelling good 
3242 2018-10-18 18:42:03 Snake oil salesman.
3243 2018-10-18 18:41:48 It's crazy that all the bad shit happening right now with the saudis, is all because of oil. Arms Deals, murder, torture, treason, Greed, #Trump is letting it happen in the name of the same shit Jed Clampett lost his marbles over. We're the worlds Beverly Hilbbillies ya'll. Dang.
3244 2018-10-18 18:41:42 If you are using black soap you gotta moisture with a water based moisturizer not necessarily an oil based one...that’s the way to balance it out. And switch it up to another kind of soap in dry szn. I love my black soap & grew up with Nigerian soap making aunties
3245 2018-10-18 18:41:40 Whistle offer Mustard oil report.  Droum, prycoud, uxuggorota.
3246 2018-10-18 18:41:39 Just. Don't. Please. The climate change is already looming like the Armageddon and it feels like literally no one cares, trump wants more of that oil coal and war money.
3247 2018-10-18 18:41:37 Christ this word is to rub with oil. To anoint. What oil? The oil of our people. The olive oil. Matthew 25. The Greek is eloia. Eloyah. El is God of nations. Those named in captivity are all with el. Daniel. Ezekiel. Yah is the sacred name. Isaiah.  Not in captivity. All included
3248 2018-10-18 18:41:31 Let's get a couple things out of the way:

1. Jobs are for cucks. You're literally signing up to be someone's bitch

2. "Creating jobs" by taking oil money from Saudcucks therefore not only makes the world worse, but makes the country cucked
3249 2018-10-18 18:41:23 Homemade cure... teacup hot water, 1 tbl Apple cider vinegar, 1 tbl organic lemon juice, 1 tbl organic honey and 1 or 2 drops of On Guard essential oil.
3250 2018-10-18 18:41:21 New zeland, estonia, hong kong, did you really used norway as an example? Im trying to be polite here but their population is 200k people, they produce half of brazils(where i am from) oil per day, with so much oil per capta is like cheating in real life
3251 2018-10-18 18:41:16 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
3252 2018-10-18 18:41:16 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
3253 2018-10-18 18:41:10 Now, @Oil_Guns_Merica, on the other hand
3254 2018-10-18 18:40:58 Yes! The $100 billion in arms sales are being proposed but nothing signed. Saudis are cash poor now with oil prices depressed.
3255 2018-10-18 18:40:56 I disagree. We would go to war with Iran before we would ever allow them to bend us over a barrel for oil (no pun intended).

I don't think we were ever that serious about defending human rights internationally. Our righteousness always accompanied other goals.
3256 2018-10-18 18:40:54 She needs a bathtub filled with oil

3264 2018-10-18 18:40:20 Native populations are dealing with oil pipeline spills and voter suppression. It would be great if we would not trip over or clothesline ourselves over racist tropes about them. It always feels strange that this so much to ask. Then again, privilege. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
3265 2018-10-18 18:40:19 that or because you called oil a juice
3266 2018-10-18 18:40:09 a wise man once said that when DonaldTrump opens his mouth, a tibetan monch wants to become politician

3272 2018-10-18 18:39:32 @Susie IF?? Susie?? And what would you do if they crashed Airplanes into our Buildings? Or had a Oil Embargo? IF?
3273 2018-10-18 18:39:32 I personally don’t believe so. This Province like it or not functions at full speed when oil drilling activity is high. Since the recession it hasn’t recovered hence the high unemployment. Take out the large number of public sector employees hired in past few years its more grim.
3274 2018-10-18 18:39:28 And they were covered for! And the family of Osama was wisked away to protect them; what we do in the name of oil is despicable - the unforgivable sin.
3275 2018-10-18 18:39:27 Nigeria has earned more than $500 billion USD in oil revenue from 1960 till date. Rich country, poor people...
3276 2018-10-18 18:39:24 "You can't change the circumstances or the seasons or the wind. But you can change your reading habits. You can change whether or not you go for the skills; burn the midnight oil; turn yourself around; multiply your value by two, three, five, or ten. That you have control of."
3277 2018-10-18 18:39:24 Standing in the lab and just heard @desusnice say niggas is really paying niggas the big bucks clean up old meth labs.  I'm done with this oil shit lmaoo
3278 2018-10-18 18:39:19 Every woman rubbing essential oils into their face to "cleanse" or "moisturize" is gonna be on the hunt for some acne fighting essential oil recipe in a couple weeks when that shit makes them break out
3279 2018-10-18 18:39:15 I’m in love with this app called Oilist, guys.  It’s pretty incredible at mimicking famous oil abstract paintings.  For this photo I decided to do a little Monet Pond, and the coolest part is that you can watch it being painted and stop it whenever you want
3280 2018-10-18 18:39:02 Dad is always taking my truck on my days off and fixing something or doing something to it. Like putting gas in it and today he’s getting the oil changed  I hate that he does that but I’m so thankful for him!
3281 2018-10-18 18:38:59 At the dealership waiting for this oil change 
3282 2018-10-18 18:38:40 Why is Nigerian government @AsoRock scared to let Biafra go? They hate Biafrans with passion, so why don't they let Biafra go? If it's oil, we make a deal with them to give them free oil, because we know they are lazy beasts #BiafraFreedomIsSacrosant
3283 2018-10-18 18:38:37 There must be some other charletains they could book, @Nigel_Farage is not the only snake oil seller.
3284 2018-10-18 18:38:37 They just build them back like oil platforms. Great thing is they won't risk leaks if they topple
3285 2018-10-18 18:38:33 It's actually very easy to avoid a car getting this rusty: spray it with oil on underbody and all cavities like inside of canals, beams. Any thick oil can be used. professionals use sheep oil called Fluid Film (a US patent) and use air driven spray tools. But any oil can be used
3286 2018-10-18 18:38:28 NOT!
3287 2018-10-18 18:38:28 Why are you allowing the global-left to control the news’ narrative on this?  Saudis kill dissidents all the time.  Yea, it’s bad...  but they trade oil in US dollars and are still a key ally in middle east.  Besides, he was a Muslim  Brotherhood propagandist.  (A terrorist org)
3288 2018-10-18 18:38:24 Bottles of Lilly or my dead cat, hmm - I know my birthday flowers.  No, I will go for Stamford Bridge.  You do it first x

3290 2018-10-18 18:38:22 We won't do anything. We are too dependant on their oil
3291 2018-10-18 18:38:20 Which snake oil salesman is this?
3292 2018-10-18 18:38:16 i dropped a white oil pastel in my bag and it got smooshed, now everything's covered in gunk :(
3293 2018-10-18 18:38:11 We can’t skip over palm oil either 
3294 2018-10-18 18:38:10 #GreatAwakening #QAnon How many millions of children women and men get killed over oil wars? Do you care? Yes or No? Do you want there blood on your hands? Yes or No? Gasoline safe? Oil wars safe?
3295 2018-10-18 18:38:09 Understood, I don’t see how we would lose the oil and gas industry at all, but as far as healthcare we are the least insured state what can we do to fix that. Cruz hasn’t stated any resolution to that. The border is a whole other issue that has too many conflicting resolutions
3296 2018-10-18 18:38:09 proactiv, witch hazel, vitamin e oil to get rid of the scars.
3297 2018-10-18 18:37:59 No. 9 – Prohibits Offshore Oil and Gas Drilling; Prohibits Vaping in Enclosed Spaces– 

Can anyone tell me why these twos choices are under one amendment for voting in FL? Oil drilling and Vaping in doors? #Politics
3298 2018-10-18 18:37:58 We don’t always have a good choice for partners but Saudi far outweigh Muslim Brotherhood who by the way are the winners along with Turkey Iran and the price of oil.
3299 2018-10-18 18:37:52 I hate for warranty purposes I need an ‘expert’ to change my oil and have a paper trail. I could do this shit for free in my driveway buuuut no
3300 2018-10-18 18:37:51 Can officially add mechanic to my list of accomplishments, @JIAMuniz and I just fixed his car with vegetable oil and a butter knife
3301 2018-10-18 18:37:50  David
3302 2018-10-18 18:37:48 Yeah :) I use facewash, is it just a natural thing that some people produce more oil than others? Cause there’s some faces I look at and I’m just like “wtf how explain! Reveal secrets” 
3303 2018-10-18 18:37:47 Meu black castor oil acabou e a minha mãe trouxe mais um p mim

3308 2018-10-18 18:37:27 because in preparation for 2019, congi and muzzis have anti-bjp, anti-hindu people promoted and forced into higher positions in these 'highly-politicial-product' running companies.

needs a thorough cleaning of twitter/fb.
3309 2018-10-18 18:37:17 Please advise, Zimbabweans are said to be having food and cooking oil shortages, is there a way I can assist?
3310 2018-10-18 18:37:13 That said, oil flows have redistributed e.g. S Korea multiplying US imports; US growth hit "run rate" 4%+; World Economic Forum report now places US regaining top spot as world's most competitive economy.
3311 2018-10-18 18:37:12 Outside 2 western provinces nobody gives a good God damn about your oil patch. We only hope it can be closed down ASAP.  We are more than happy to endure ANY consequences.
3312 2018-10-18 18:37:02 I fully believe in defending the country...  I NOT believe in illegally invading foreign countries for oil, central banks and Israel’s holy wars.   What’s the consequences here at home? Skyrocketing cost of living and loss of freedom.
3313 2018-10-18 18:36:58 @heidiscruz Oh dear, you don't know about the millions your corrupt husband has taken from the NRA? Big Pharma? The Russians? Oil and Gas Interests?
3314 2018-10-18 18:36:56 Consider it done. I weigh a little more than you do so I had to slather up in baby oil first so it kind of happens anyway.
3315 2018-10-18 18:36:53 Good shout. Could sort this stinking cold out without going to the gym to use the steam room. Don’t think olbas oil is good for the dishes
3316 2018-10-18 18:36:46 Let see if the Globalist will scream " HUMAN RIGHTS", since this is not in Arabia.There is GENOCIDE against Jews and Christians by the British govt and their jihadists to steal oil and gas, complete SILENCE @realDonaldTrump @VP @SecPompeo
3317 2018-10-18 18:36:21 And they were protecting Soviet oil.
3318 2018-10-18 18:36:15 need to put oil in my car & don’t know how to do it so i’m just sitting in the parking lot helpless lmao
3319 2018-10-18 18:36:12 But I’ve been using olive oil for the past 2 days and im already seeing new hair growing
3320 2018-10-18 18:36:10 The facts are that the USA cannot function without Saudi oil- unless we want to pay over 5$/g at the pumps.  And then of course there are trump's hotels that are always filled with Saudis..
3321 2018-10-18 18:36:08 where the oil plugs at? 
3322 2018-10-18 18:36:08 @Reachout_mcd @McDonalds so not sure how often the fry oil gets changed, but store at 2205 W Jonathan Moore Pike in Columbus, Indiana let me know today their oil is old and the nasty fries are as good as they are going to get. #Awful
3323 2018-10-18 18:36:07 Gimme the oil & fat && heart attack food && im fully satisfied
3324 2018-10-18 18:36:06 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
3325 2018-10-18 18:36:02 And more voters from outside the country.
3326 2018-10-18 18:35:53 Entered dealership for oil change now my car feels different :/
3327 2018-10-18 18:35:51 Seems to me, it's a self filling well, up grade. on oil ,between 8and 4x recoverble than expected, and that's only the starters ,these papers are looking silly pricks now, even getting limp
3328 2018-10-18 18:35:46 A6b: We must be careful not make the mistakes we made in the oil sector. The time to emphasis and embed local content in the RE sector of Africa and Nigeria is now. #GridlessAfrica
3329 2018-10-18 18:35:39 Castor Oil time.
3330 2018-10-18 18:35:37 ohhhhhmyfuckinggoooodddddd how long do oil changes take??? I’ve been in this bitch FOR-EVER I’m about to LOSE my FUCKING mind
3331 2018-10-18 18:35:36 NO, it is because Israel DICTATE American FOREIGN policies ESPECIALLY in Trump era 100%. Israel & Saudis MOST likely had a secret relations be4.Since 9/11 this relationship evolved so much. NO LONGER can be keep secret. Genie is OUT of bottle! Oil etc are the CHERRIES on the TOP!
3332 2018-10-18 18:35:20 Now you prepare that Fetzer valve with some oil and some gauze pads, and I'm gonna need about ten quarts of antifreeze, preferably Prestone. No, make that Quaker State.
3333 2018-10-18 18:35:20 Oil is the earth's milk, and only the strong may suckle at mothers tit
3334 2018-10-18 18:35:10 1) they are short on oil due to Iran sanctions (replacement by Saudi oil or exemptions from Iran sanctions)

2) F-35s 

3) id be really surprised, but extradition of that cleric guy living in the states that Erdogan blames for the attempted coup.
3335 2018-10-18 18:35:08 قعدت اقول معقول هو.. من غير عربية ف عز الضهر
3336 2018-10-18 18:35:05 انا لله قوي عزيز
3337 2018-10-18 18:35:02 Chicken cutlet parm and spaghetti with garlic and onions and olive oil. Every birthday that was my request :)
3338 2018-10-18 18:35:02 looks like a church window
pick a theme and I will change mine too ?? not cows again
3339 2018-10-18 18:34:57 They're guilty. Now comes the decision by the entire world, walk away and pay more for their oil from others or accept the lie to protect their wallets; it always comes down to their oil & the world's unwillingness to drill on their own land to bypass this strangle hold.
3340 2018-10-18 18:34:50 Changing your own oil is all fun and games until you have spill 
3341 2018-10-18 18:34:49 Has Nigeria stopped exporting oil?
3342 2018-10-18 18:34:46 Trump is so inarticulate and tells numerous obviously contradictory lies. Why is he supposed to be so compelling as a con man? I don’t see it. The snake oil practically oozes off him and is visible to the naked eye. The air around him speaks: “This  person is not trustworthy.”
3343 2018-10-18 18:34:45 Security : Buhari promised to put an end to Bokoharam, we'll have to applaud him on this as we don't have church and mosque bombings anymore, what we have now is the kidnapping of students, lecturers looking for oil in the far north and of course his brothers (herdsmen).
3344 2018-10-18 18:34:43 Okay so I love coconut everything. Coconut perfume, conditioner, lotions, coconut oil, coconut scent wax, and leche de coco in my food wherever I can sneak it in. Coconut desserts make my entire day.
3345 2018-10-18 18:34:39 excellent list. I already take note. 
garlic and turmeric (kurkuma) use natural not gel. results amazing.
garlic for taste problem mix with few drops of olive oil + water. no taste at all mix garlic + just warm milk. taste excellent and no taste or odor in mouth.
3346 2018-10-18 18:34:36 Deep fried in peanut oil.

With "high blood pressure", aka salt.

How's A'ville Shirley?
3347 2018-10-18 18:34:33 Both Congress and BJP are keeping the oil burning to throwout Kerala government. If anyone has something against the court order why he is not filing review petition instead of showing violent protests?
3348 2018-10-18 18:34:25 I forgot to bring my airpods while waiting to get my oil changed but it turned out great because Delilah and her soothing voice were on CNN being interviewed
3349 2018-10-18 18:34:22 Niggas on ig mixing Muslim oil & Vaseline in a pot with the caption “how to smell good all day” 
3350 2018-10-18 18:34:14 We have shortages in basic goods such as cooking oil & bread BUT not all the products. Shops are not as empty as you portray in the bread racks you inserted
3351 2018-10-18 18:34:08 Just waiting for this little journalist murder to blow over so we can get back to business. Oil business that is. And arms. Lots of arms.
3352 2018-10-18 18:33:58 US sanctions have been in long and continuous use, at least since the oil and iron embargo placed on Japan prior to WWI, Note those were after Nanking so some reason other than pure self interest can be attached to them. Not so much nowadays.
3353 2018-10-18 18:33:55 Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.
3354 2018-10-18 18:33:52 When a mf get mad they gon say everything they never say when they smoking yo weed and drinking yo oil
3355 2018-10-18 18:33:44 It is an excellent representation of Greta Garbo, what's odd about that?
3356 2018-10-18 18:33:35 "I love hiking!"

Narrator: she did not love hiking
3357 2018-10-18 18:33:30 Unless you want to pay 5$/g for fuel and 6$/g for home heating oil.. that is. The USA is dependent on Saudi oil.
3358 2018-10-18 18:33:25 lolllllll, Apple is worth a trillion and that's just one company.

What the fuck are you talking about my friend, the US economy will never collapse we make design and invent things, Saudi Arabia has nothing but oil.

Oil we now make for our selfs, you are no longer useful.
3359 2018-10-18 18:33:23 I did a wash n go with literally a dime size amount of oil and I can def tell the difference from when I use a bunch of oil.
3360 2018-10-18 18:33:16 Ok I’m about to wrap my hair! I need to go get some oil for my hair first
3361 2018-10-18 18:33:15 About to call a lyft to pick me up because this oil change is taking wayyy too long
3362 2018-10-18 18:33:09 Those are eye popping numbers, but we cant ne naive enough to think any government would substantially decrease income taxes.  However, what if they were to sink that "new found" oil money into subsidizing university, improving infrastructure, etc.?
3363 2018-10-18 18:32:51 The largest producer of oil in the world is the US. The largest deposits of oil in the world is in Venezula. Even if somehow there as a 'petrol dollar', Saudi Arabia would be almost entirely irrelevant to thay.
3364 2018-10-18 18:32:44 CHICK FIL A USES PEANUT OIL TO FRY THEIR CHICKEN?????????????
3365 2018-10-18 18:32:38 @Channel4News that man has lost his soul. There is clearly a price to actually get away with murder and it’s payable in barrels of oil and arms deals
3366 2018-10-18 18:32:30 oil isn't the solution to anything.
3367 2018-10-18 18:32:28 .Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
3368 2018-10-18 18:32:26 The place I’m getting my car’s oil changed at smells like feet. 
3369 2018-10-18 18:32:25 Yes. Hello. Since it isn't 80+ degrees outside anymore, can my skin stop being a complete oil slick? I would appreciate it so, so much.
3370 2018-10-18 18:32:18 I would prefer not to. Most Western countries are too reliant on the Saudis for oil in part because the US has put so much time and money on destroying Iraq and Syria which were both fairly stable and equitable countries or were similar to Saudi Arabia at any rate.
3371 2018-10-18 18:32:06 Lyn..
oh god I just ruptured one..

BTW lyn,,,can you change ya profile picture its a bit...odd.
3372 2018-10-18 18:32:05 Are you sure? Because, you know..."Caitlin".
3373 2018-10-18 18:32:04 it looks exactly how it is. the less oil is left in the world, and the more climate change becomes a clear world problem, the more brutal will the saudi's get, and more brutal the capitalists co-operation with them.  #c4news
3374 2018-10-18 18:32:03 The fact that he threw in he get Free Oil Changes & Tire Rotation . It ain’t hard to change some oil. Salesman got his ass
3375 2018-10-18 18:32:03 Do you ask for extra oil when you buy beans?
3376 2018-10-18 18:31:54 We have oil heat so I'm glad that oil isn't outrageously priced this year. We switched over from an electric heat system 4 years ago to save money.
3377 2018-10-18 18:31:53 Well I still need to fix my glove box get my rotors fixed and get a new tire but atleast I got my oil changed
3378 2018-10-18 18:31:53 A $90 oil change should be illegal
3379 2018-10-18 18:31:52 Perhaps someone needs to tell him we're still a net importer of oil before he starts selling it to other countries.  Zero investments doesn't mean zero cash flowing into Trump from Russia and Saudi Arabia. They are always so careful with their lies!
3380 2018-10-18 18:31:49 If you're around, I can drop off the cbd oil
3381 2018-10-18 18:31:45 Mossad and cia use isil to destabilise region and gaining power more in oil resources. Assad is only puppet.

3383 2018-10-18 18:31:31 Grape seed oil has really helped improve my dry skin! You can get it off Amazon
3384 2018-10-18 18:31:25 Bloomberg: "President Donald Trump’s request to Saudi Arabia that it increase oil production shows how few options he has to lower prices at the gasoline pumps ahead of elections that are key to continuing his agenda."
3385 2018-10-18 18:31:25 If you're around, I can drop off the cbd oil
3386 2018-10-18 18:31:21 You’re welcs! You’re gonna love it! make sure it’s the matte bottle! Oil free.
3387 2018-10-18 18:31:18 By putting butter, ghee, oil, whatever in your coffee, you’re not fasting anymore. You’re negating the myriad of wonders that true fasting brings. I have seen more ailments “cured” with IF or prolonged fasts than any diet, supplement, or any other health strategy/tool.
3388 2018-10-18 18:31:16 I literally always smell like bath and body works perfume, weed, and coconut oil 
3389 2018-10-18 18:31:16 Walmart so fuckin slow wit these oil changes

3391 2018-10-18 18:31:04 Will the Saudi’s allow an independent forensic team go into their embassy. Just because you have been buying their oil since 1932 does not make them friends. Especially since most of 911 terrorist can frim Saudi! 
3392 2018-10-18 18:31:00 Thou shalt not kill... unless there's a $110B arms deal on the table, or oil, or especially both.
It's the New-New Testament.
3393 2018-10-18 18:30:59 Bubba we're gonna have to switch to a new system soon or the world is gonna be in deep kimchee. Humans consume 2 trillions gallons of oil a year, and climbing. What happens when that runs out? Complete economic collapse - greater threat than climate change. Musk is trying, anyway
3394 2018-10-18 18:30:57 端末じゃ限界あるじゃないですか！
3395 2018-10-18 18:30:54 well, cheese is mostly pointless so yeah, good call on that. i still eat a fair amount of animal fat, peanut butter and use olive oil to cook stuff because it does wonders for satiation.
3396 2018-10-18 18:30:49 @Shehzad_Ind Sir, why don’t you reduce the oil price with your influence. Due to the price of oil, instead of 125, only 36 #Rafale aircraft are being taken....!

3406 2018-10-18 18:29:42 Haven't played competitive cricket in a while, but all this hype around the @MSL_T20 has me itching to oil the old willow and play some T20 cricket, even if in a social league .
3407 2018-10-18 18:29:38 The Saudi holds the strings to oil. We pissed them off you pay 6 bucks per gallon. See why we need the keystone pipeline and drilling in other places to say screw you Saudi's
3408 2018-10-18 18:29:35 Amin thumma amin.
3409 2018-10-18 18:29:25 I finally took my car for an oil change but damn she’s hella needy! She needs a lot more maintenance. Like my dad would say querías carro verdad!
3410 2018-10-18 18:29:14 So these ladies think Tumi is the Jezebelif only they knew, Khabhonina is the one that needs more than holy water and oil #TheRiver1Magic
3411 2018-10-18 18:29:10 How about an unfair regulation like zoning laws? California's straw ban? Needing a license to skateboard in California? Prohibiting the harassment of Bigfoot in Washington? These are real laws.

Hell, even the regulation of weed; a plant that could reduce the use of oil plastic.
3412 2018-10-18 18:29:10 At present I smell of home-made olive oil soap. I regularly season myself.
3413 2018-10-18 18:29:10 Oil pulling is the best thing ever.
3414 2018-10-18 18:28:59 My financial goals include being stable enough to regularly buy nice olive oil #dreambig
3415 2018-10-18 18:28:50 Chart looks disgusting and oil prices coming in, as are budgets it seems. Could this just be a hedge for shorts?
3416 2018-10-18 18:28:40 @carcomplaints i think you need to apply some quality control on your CRV oil article at hondaproblems. There is a lot of completely wrong information you’re spreading that is going to worry people. CRV 4th gen stops at 2016 and does not have a 1.5L engine in any country
3417 2018-10-18 18:28:33 ていかーさんおやすみですー！
3418 2018-10-18 18:28:28 We make more oil than you do, the only reason why we give a shit about Saudi's is because you sell oil in US dollar. 

But that does not matter anymore, as you have crossed the red line.
3419 2018-10-18 18:28:24 The highlighter is bomb. So is body hero oil. Cloud paint and the skin tint
3420 2018-10-18 18:28:24 Just out of curiosity- do you know what it is specifically that you’re allergic to, or is it just any strong smell? Like is it a chemical compound that’s in a ton of artificial fragrances, or could something like an essential oil diffuser trigger it too? (Feel free to not answer)
3421 2018-10-18 18:28:19 So you’re totally against Trump’s ludicrous energy policy that takes us farther away from energy independence and tries to take us back to the 19th century when we were reliant on coal and oil, right?
3422 2018-10-18 18:28:18 So yes,I have very picky eater in 2nd grade & for school lunch all he wants is Russian crepes w/brown sugar,naked juice & I throw few more snacks like cheese, barbecue chips,cookies, etc. No eggs, oil,milk or flower —no crepes! Thank you4 Supermarkets!

3426 2018-10-18 18:27:30 Taking into account the crude oil, weapons purchases, and $5 billion investment in silicon valley (google) there is no conceivable way this is going to change our relationship with saudi arabia ... get over it.
3427 2018-10-18 18:27:26 Please put forth your best armament and remember to oil and clean your sidearm. Don’t want any pits or rust in the barrel.

3430 2018-10-18 18:26:58 Just put washing up liquid in my pan instead of olive oil, what's up with you
3431 2018-10-18 18:26:56 bought a new bottle of ‘EMO OIL’ huh

Also currently we pump more oil than Saudi Arabia, the days of oil are gone my friend.

3441 2018-10-18 18:26:03 They are the chief Sunni bulwark vs Iran, a major buyer of billions of US weapons and a major oil supplier. As guardians of Islam’s holiest site, they influence Muslims worldwide. Like everyone else in the Middle East they are not Jeffersonian democrats.
3442 2018-10-18 18:26:03 G W Bush ignored them for the role they played in the 9/11 attack, why should 1 death matter to you  (or the GOP) than the 3000 on 9/11 ? It is about the OIL, we know that. If we were working to get off the OIL teat we wouldn't need them, but no, Trump killed off that initiative.
3443 2018-10-18 18:25:49 And the Bern would be the first to criticize trump taking a hard line with the saudi's resulting in an oil price spike, which the poor and middle-class would get hammered. Bern's playing cheap politics
3444 2018-10-18 18:25:39 Bring baby oil ... I heard the ones for ur side there dey reveal the packs dread ...

3451 2018-10-18 18:25:13 US invade Saudi on the account their part in 911 and take control of it's oil, hell they use our defense weapons it wouldn't be hard to disable, and no other superpower in the world would care except for the fact that US now has the market on oil in their hands.
Problem solved.
3452 2018-10-18 18:24:50 If we spent the last 15 years inventing and refining reliable alternatives to crude oil rather than carpet bombing the living daylights out of half a continent, we wouldn’t be standing here debating ourself on whether or not SA can be trusted.
3453 2018-10-18 18:24:49 Turn to God and apply anointing oil.
3454 2018-10-18 18:24:44 Minimum 50. If not , Oil of Ulay has failed... miserably.  x
3455 2018-10-18 18:24:40 guess who actually brought their car in to get tires and oil changed I DID BITCHES
3456 2018-10-18 18:24:36 someone pay for my oil change pls
3457 2018-10-18 18:24:34 idk why i read it as octopus oil but i did.
3458 2018-10-18 18:24:32 that bit in salt fat acid heat where they drink fresh olive oil from a wine glass... I feel it
3459 2018-10-18 18:24:28 Just in time for my road trip ! Oil change, new gas tank, inspection renewed, brand new breaks and tires  and now I need a car detail .
3460 2018-10-18 18:24:27 At City Mazda right now getting the oil changed and requested they change my appointment from Nov 26th to the 1st for my winter tire change LOL. Can't even remember the last time it snowed this early. Not risking it with summer tires, my car is only 6 months old! lol.
3461 2018-10-18 18:24:12 Will you pay for my gas & double priced goods & hire me when my employer lays off due to rising oil prices?

Doesn't morality include considering the fate our our economy, the jobs &budgets of millions of Americans?
We dont have to love these barbarians to do business with them.
3462 2018-10-18 18:24:11 But in other news i gave 40 ivy league MBA students a talk on the business of oil and gas: upstream and downstream. So clearly still winning

3464 2018-10-18 18:23:44 Y’all I really be making em or trying different ones that I pick up. I tried the honey one from lush & a few I find in TJ Max. The one I made is sugar & whatever essentials oil you like. I like grape seed oil &  jojoba oil @_dreamscometru0 @Courtassippi @ohtwixie
3465 2018-10-18 18:23:39 Perhaps he needs it for the oil he slaps on his hair
3466 2018-10-18 18:23:37 I was the same way!!  pregnancy rashes are definitely the worst!! Which I do find that the oil helped with the itching but clearly didn’t prevent the stretch marks either way the rashes, the stretch marks, the endless bags under my eyes  it’s all worth it!
3467 2018-10-18 18:23:24 As admitted by Mr Wilson, mendacity was used by Yes campaign in 2014 regarding the oil figures. Had Yes won, would the No side have had a claim based on the Yes campaign lying to the public?
3468 2018-10-18 18:23:24 Republican, Democrat, same thing.  Same wars. Same Flint with toxic water. Same assault on journalists and whistle blowers. Same rape of the earth for oil and natural gas. The difference is that Trump is visible an asshole where as Obama attempted subterfuge...
3469 2018-10-18 18:23:22 I missed my oil change appt this morning , no regrets had the biggest headache last night & now I feel well rested 
3470 2018-10-18 18:23:20 -did kelsi need an oil change: no
-is kenn suprised she took her car in anyways: also no
3471 2018-10-18 18:22:57 i’m inhaling eucalyptus oil because it apparently helps with congested nose and i feel like a koala
3472 2018-10-18 18:22:54 The food triangle is wrong.  We are told to load up on carbs for energy but our bodies run best on fats.  I have coconut oil in coffee in the morning and 4 egg omelette.  Eat a lot less and more energy.
3473 2018-10-18 18:22:48 As I was raised on a farm in Italy and sometimes mention the food we made, a work acquaintance asked me which olive oil I preferred, and without a second’s hesitation I said Palestinian olive oil.A friend’s mother once gave me a bottle fresh from a harvest and it was incomparable

3475 2018-10-18 18:22:40 The Mesozoic era was much warmer than today and the planet had no ice caps. Despite the existence of some deserts, there was enough vegetation to feed animals of 80 tons. Tropical climate(NOT caused by CO2)/ magnetosphere 3x stronger / higher atmospheric density = oil used today
3476 2018-10-18 18:22:36 5) Whole Food Plant Based (to skip the processed stuff like oil and white flour etc...)
3477 2018-10-18 18:22:31 Because they are worst than Saudi Arabia and other bad actors,do you know the story of BIAFRA?study it and understand what UK did during that war and what they are still doing today because of oil, they are beggars and destroyers
3478 2018-10-18 18:22:27 If you wash your face with oil what do you use to remove that oil?
3479 2018-10-18 18:22:22 I'd agree that the oil industry was well supported by the Feds in the 20th century, but has seen more than its fair share of up and downs since 2010.

And when that industry creates 10s of billons of dollars in taxes and economic growth, it's easy to understand the frustration.
3480 2018-10-18 18:22:21 Could it be the following: Emoluments from a country that treats women as second class citizens; makes the Islamic world look bad because of Wahhabism; in a solar & tech world, still bangs the oil war drums; and is run by a Dudebro king rattling sabers with Iran & fighting Yemen?
3481 2018-10-18 18:22:01 That'll be the oil from the Scotland tree.
3482 2018-10-18 18:21:57 Colleague who just came back from US after 3 years is unable to cope with the crowd, traffic, atmosphere, water, food, oil, lavda, lessun of India...
3483 2018-10-18 18:21:48 The Yorubas say that it is only the finger covered with palm oil that people would lick, not the finger covered with blood. You will smile again.
3484 2018-10-18 18:21:43 Hmmm, maybe this could be hawked unscrupulously by con men like snake oil, have I discovered... fatent medicine?
3485 2018-10-18 18:21:39 Auto sector bailout IS oil sector support. Economics killed all but Gateway, it would have killed that too if it hadn't been KO'd. Key players in the oil sector ASKED for carbon taxes. The oil sector is a sunset industry. Stop moping.
3486 2018-10-18 18:21:37 The tea is that, from the perspective of a shopper, scentsy is the only MLM that isn’t a complete sham money grab. All these MLMs promising you weight loss teas, “colour enhancing” shampoos and magic serums are just selling you beautifully packaged snake oil.

3488 2018-10-18 18:21:34 Instead of relaxing regulations on greenhouse gas emissions and toxic chemicals, have you thought of convincing the coal/oil industries to migrate, or at least diversify, into clean energy?
No? I didn't think so.

3495 2018-10-18 18:20:45 I just read an ARC of #InFocusEssentialOils by #MarleneHoughton A fantastic book for anyone who is interested in, or already an essential oil user. It includes definitive guides to the oils, how to use oils for particular ailments, which oils to blend and more! #Netgalley
3496 2018-10-18 18:20:30 Man i ate that bojangles and now all i wanna do is sleep. But i got 7 more oil changes to do fml 
3497 2018-10-18 18:20:27 considering the price we pay for saudi oil, mining uranium ourselves is cheaper. and its also healthier...
3498 2018-10-18 18:20:24 Why is it...
If the government finds oil and diamonds in your backyard or compound it becomes government property
If they find drugs its your property...
How now...

3502 2018-10-18 18:20:14 And the largest source of crude oil in the world, which accounts for nearly 90% of exports, and occupies the Kingdom ranked 19th among the largest economies in the world and Saudi Arabia is one of the most influential forces politically and economically in the world,
3503 2018-10-18 18:20:07 A gallon for petrol. But why is it 1,45 a gal. In EU but they have no oil Wells and the US and Saudis have so much of it its all in storage till the price is high

3510 2018-10-18 18:19:33 Habibi, you’ve got much bigger challenges than that. One of them is your people are just too lazy. You’ve been spoon-fed oil money for generations. Name one Saudi product before oil, won’t you please? Now the chickens are coming home to roost. Fix the mooching culture if you can.

3515 2018-10-18 18:19:07 As I tweeted the other day, nothing gets done without MBS knowledge. Aramco IPO is now dead and Saudis need to get the oil price up to sustain their economy.
3516 2018-10-18 18:19:01 The World Trade Organization and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). [29]

Saudi Arabia enjoys a stable political and economic position in general and its oil economy as it has the second largest oil reserves and six gas reserves,
3517 2018-10-18 18:18:57 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
3518 2018-10-18 18:18:29 This sudden assault on Saudi is very surprising. Yes, yes I know it's strategically useful as a stick to beat Trump with, but still....are we finally seeing the Deep State attempting to pull back from the desert nomads-turned-oil sheikhs?

3521 2018-10-18 18:18:12 think mufflers, oil changes, brake pads, timing belts, fluid changes (Tesla has a few, like washer fluid but nothing like an ICE car) and the list goes on :)
3522 2018-10-18 18:17:58 I need some relief. Enough of this bullshit with my back. So much pain last night and today. #Wah
Going for some oil next week.
Please let it help.

3523 2018-10-18 18:17:49 We would have blown up Saudi years ago based on the way they treat their people and control them with a religion  that is cruel ! But they have oil !  Come in Tesla and bye bye Saudi !
3524 2018-10-18 18:17:43 A $10 dollar-a-barrel tax on Texas oil is not good for Texas.

3526 2018-10-18 18:17:40 @sainsburys I'm sure my local store stocks many varieties of olive oil so why was my out of stock item substituted with balsamic vinegar  only connection was the brand.
3527 2018-10-18 18:17:38 I had that problem. It’s a lot of maintenance if you want it to flourish. I saw keep braids and twists, oil on ya scalp, and a good wash schedule.
3528 2018-10-18 18:17:36 I got my oil change so talk to me like the young independent woman who don’t need a man that I am OK?

3530 2018-10-18 18:17:26 Thank you Mr. Trudeau for screwing up Canadian energy policy so our oil can't get to market.  Western Canadian Select trading at US$22 vs $70+ for West Texas oil.  Cda sells at 22 and buys at $70.
3531 2018-10-18 18:17:24 Is facial cleansing oil a scam?
3532 2018-10-18 18:17:21 One sided and biased. There’s oil down there! The (at least) 31 tankers prove that. You’d think a brexit loving paper would be positive a find that could help the economy.

3542 2018-10-18 18:16:16 That's a really interesting point. The markup on dealership oil changes and 'routine' maintenance are huge. I wonder how much the savings would work out to over the life of an electric vehicle.

3549 2018-10-18 18:15:48 We sell arms to over 100 countries, some legally lol, but when it comes to an oil rich country....

3560 2018-10-18 18:14:51 LOL, I think if you look past the talking points you'll find that government subsidies to oil companies amounts to deferred taxes on exploratory drilling and tax credits when it doesn't work out. The same type of tax subsidies all working Ameriicans get.
3561 2018-10-18 18:14:48 I’m subjected to this lecture hall for the next like 2-3 hrs and it smells like onions. Like the raw ones lathered in mayo, oil and vinegar on a sub. Why. 
3562 2018-10-18 18:14:39 You don't mention that we've been collecting debt since 2008 on a similar trend, when oil was high. UCP is the same party a new name doesn't change that. Carbon tax didn't kill jobs, oil prices & lack of a pipeline did. Guess we should have diversified when times were good.

3573 2018-10-18 18:13:49 Neither, but the world has energy (oil) problem and significant wealth going to Tamim and MBS to let them control voices in our USA,  they will keep buying weapons, people and influence

Where's the $1 trillion infrastructure package?
or the price controls on prescription drugs?
How bout  breaking up America’s largest banks?
Where is the oil you said you'd take from Iraq?
Or the money from Mexico to build the wall?

3579 2018-10-18 18:13:29 Semantics! Point is your potus is complicit in his murder sir..... was it because of oil? Money? Both?
3580 2018-10-18 18:13:29 I read that if this thing with Saudi blows up, they could cut off oil and gas would be $7 a gallon.

I’m not really sure that would be the worst thing for, you know, us figuring out a way to wean ourselves from our fossil fuel addiction.
3581 2018-10-18 18:13:24 Of course we can live without oil and we did before.  Buggered up the whale population though.
3582 2018-10-18 18:13:24 The Saudi's Turks should both be sanctioned for this brutal murder. They're NOT YOUR AVERAGE ROYAL FAMILY. NO CLASS WHATSOEVER. They can shove their fine jewels, gold, pearls+oil up their canals. They knew where to run during Desert Storm/Kuwait so the fields would'nt be torched
3583 2018-10-18 18:13:19 David Wagner sentiment drags global stocks lower; oil falls
3584 2018-10-18 18:13:15 While the Kashoogi incident isn't worth starting a war ocer, it warrants a deeper look at our relationship with animals disguised as royalty, who murder people. How much is the price of oil really?! @realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo
3585 2018-10-18 18:13:13 2) How about:
Stop buying their oil. We don't need it.
Stop supplying arms & technical support to their military. We're supporting war crimes in Yemen.
Stop sharing American intelligence with the Saudis. Do you trust them? I don't.

3589 2018-10-18 18:12:57 Fracking is only a reasonable industry when the price of oil is high enough that it's profitable. If there is a glut in oil in world wide markets and the price goes down, the cost to Frack to produce oil makes it a losing proposition.
3590 2018-10-18 18:12:52 Started listening to @YourKickstarter and it def scratches that itch of snake oil dipshits and grifters getting taken down. Also it's so fucking funny. Highly recommend
3591 2018-10-18 18:12:51 It also doesn’t have the after taste olive oil has.  I can’t wait to try it on a salad too.
3592 2018-10-18 18:12:42 I need my oil changed , a trip to the nail salon and the mall. 
3593 2018-10-18 18:12:41 Another day of chaos with Don the Con, creating another crisis to distract from his incompetence and immoral behavior. It’s always something with the National Snake Oil Salesman.
3594 2018-10-18 18:12:40 Natural gas is AFFORDABLE- Unlike oil, natural gas enjoys significant price stability over time. #DriveNaturalGasNow
3595 2018-10-18 18:12:28 Are you advocating for nationalizing the sector? Surely not. Governments advance the shift to renewables through carbon taxes and subsidies. That’s their job. Private sector’s job is to generate wealth. Who owns the Canadian banks that control the oil sector? We all do.
3596 2018-10-18 18:12:28 certains ont du souci à se faire @sfoucart. c'est quand le jour ou les journalistes du journal de référence se rebellent?
3597 2018-10-18 18:12:26 Tucker that was a great episode. It's tough getting grass fed meat here, I can get some beef at $10.00 a pound but that's about it. Would you suggest to go lean meat to avoid most Omega 6 and add grass fed butter or ghee? Is cooking with olive and avocado oil ok?thks

3600 2018-10-18 18:11:59 Sir,In such a High Volatile Markets.
Trading  is difficult without  understanding  The Market Psychology and high Regular data Analysis is must and Postional trading can Become Risky. 

Still for tomorrow  
Oil Marketing  companies can be on Radar as Crudes are falling  again
3601 2018-10-18 18:11:56 Yes yes we get it Ed you aren't very bright. You don't understand international affairs.
You don't understand that if Trump does what people like you are demanding everything you buy will get a LOT more expensive as the Saudis will push up global oil prices massively.
3602 2018-10-18 18:11:53 She’s a horrible person!

Little off topic, but still fits the narrative: my brother is a 55 yo rep trump lover. He joined The Proud Boys in OK and is thrilled he’s the oldest member in the state (maybe nationwide). I’m appalled! We’re Jewish for one thing. We r like oil & water
3603 2018-10-18 18:11:47 Ah yes, often when served a box of popcorn at the multiplex I think “you know what would improve this, pouring a pint of oil over it” #BritishBoyTriesAmericanCandy
3604 2018-10-18 18:11:39 The strategic importance is more for Israel for more reasons than simple arms sales. #PersianGulf #RedSea #Oil #Gas #Iran
3605 2018-10-18 18:11:37 actually.... germany has everything it needs for the german energy needs. bavaria is rich in uranium. nuclear power could also fuel electric cars. if we use our own resources to their full potential, we do not need saudi oil. all it needs is a decision to say now to globalism.
3606 2018-10-18 18:11:26 Just paid $4.20/GAL for gas at a Shell station in a Seattle suburb. Thanks president tRump for all you’ve done to disrupt and increase global oil prices.
3607 2018-10-18 18:11:25 I used it instead of olive oil on my salmon and some other dishes and omg I love it. I don’t know to describe the texture and flavor other than smooooooth.
3608 2018-10-18 18:11:21 i cant revoke saudi arabias oil, and unless they are magically unable to mine, they will be able to gain more money and as a result power as a nation. there is no way to control how much btc they have either. its decentralized, remember?
3609 2018-10-18 18:11:20 saw you were using wipes!  try an oil based cleanser (preferably one that will emulsify when you add water) and really work it in. Try it a few times (:
3610 2018-10-18 18:11:19 Oh and I did the half butter half olive oil and I’ll never use vegetable oil again xxxxx
3611 2018-10-18 18:11:18 The US should stop bending over to pick up all this Saudi oil money. They have been exporting their terrorist Wahhabi ideology for far too long.
3612 2018-10-18 18:11:17 ..... Jill, legalization is a gov't joke. Oh... we need additional tax funding! Cannabis! The gov't prices in Canada are already 'higher' plus taxes than the black market... Oh, where will people still spend their bucks? I have not smoked it for years but recently using CBD oil.
3613 2018-10-18 18:11:17 That’s like comparing oil and water

3615 2018-10-18 18:11:15 Oil below 80.... Great!!!!
3616 2018-10-18 18:11:09 Value rice was $1.8 last year & it was $3.2 b4 the price madness. choice beef was $6.50 & now $10-13. Cooking oil used to be $2.7 now $3.3-$3.9. Combi $0.5 now $0.75. bread was $0.90 and now $1.10. What else in that basket besides rent, utilities & xul fees has not gone up by 10%
3617 2018-10-18 18:11:06 Actually .@tb_times it's due to the US buying their oil. Has nothing to do with .@realdonaldtrump 

They've been killing critics even under #Democrat presidents. Imagine that truth.
3618 2018-10-18 18:11:06 The looming threat of climate change, likely leading to mass starvation, and cataclysmic human migration, gets a pass, in favour of cheap energy...u really think people G.A.S. about reality in future oil supply shock? Give me cheap energy, and any story u care to explain it with.
3619 2018-10-18 18:10:52 Yea? You wanna work at the oil field in the middle of no where and sleep in the car?
3620 2018-10-18 18:10:51 for all intents and purposes, american cheese is just cheddar, half of which didn't get dried or aged properly, that was cut apart and combined with oil.

just use shredded cheddar if you can't be bothered to cover
3621 2018-10-18 18:10:50 And British at that 
3622 2018-10-18 18:10:47 There are amazing people @brockmcgregor, unfortunately you're not one of them. Snake oil salesman by day, and incompetent councilor by night. Please explain why the ONLY mall in Chatham is NOT wheelchair accessible. The Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, read it.

3626 2018-10-18 18:10:24 I wonder how much cannabis oil it takes to raise the dead.
3627 2018-10-18 18:10:24 LNG and Oil (petroleum) are significant "baseline" contributors in the models Dan has provided. Both rely on imported inputs just like coal. Oil prices also tend to be volatile and Brent is currently $80/bbl.
3628 2018-10-18 18:10:20 おにーさんにまかせとけー！
3629 2018-10-18 18:10:15 Do not feel like going to get my oil changed. I hate doing stuff that has to do with my car.
3630 2018-10-18 18:10:13 @GbagboEmmanuel I’m feeling the fire and the oil. I can’t wait 
3631 2018-10-18 18:10:07 Years ago pre oil Scotland produced an extra day a week for export. After feeding heating living costs in NHS & Welfare Scotland had a whole day to create surplus. With oil that can only have improved
3632 2018-10-18 18:10:07 what are they doing?  Is this the pipeline tragedy?  oil??

3635 2018-10-18 18:09:52 I hope he will answer honestly because they will probably announce a reduction and be collecting something else off record. Waivers and oil licences can also compensate for it
3636 2018-10-18 18:09:35 @realDonaldTrump is the epitome of a snake oil salesman. If you approve of his character then one has to wonder about your character. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica

3640 2018-10-18 18:09:17 90% of the rich Men here that oppress us & make us conscious of our poverty made their money from dirty sources. It's either theft, breach of trust, contract inflation, subsidy scam, oil bunkering, government monopoly, abuse of banking privileges. Most of them, that's their money
3641 2018-10-18 18:09:17 Amin
3642 2018-10-18 18:09:12 Is Uncle Sam backed into the corner? Is this the end of the petrodollar? Are we about to see World War 3 to protect the petrodollar and the arms for oil trade that's been happening for decades?

i rlly hope he doesn’t have to cut it 
3645 2018-10-18 18:08:53 Y’all be using all the canola oil and call it glowing smh 
3646 2018-10-18 18:08:48 E-vitamin oil, jojoba oil, or if you want something real fancy, the CND Solaroil. That one is my favorite because it sinks in really good and fast without just laying on top of the skin
3647 2018-10-18 18:08:47 Thanks friend. Agreed. Twain said it best in the mid-to-late 19th century — where hucksters, charlatans, and cocky-proud Evangelicals roamed the country, trying to trick decent folk into buying their shit snake and Bible “oil.”
“Stay clear of anyone arrogantly self-righteous...
3648 2018-10-18 18:08:43 He’s a 7ft corkscrew at this point. We should be using him to break ground drilling for oil he’s turned so much.
3649 2018-10-18 18:08:26 That would be an excellent idea. A simple preparation would be the coconut oil in a sunny window or put the jar in a pan of hot (not boiling) water until it is liquid, and saturate it with turmeric.

3652 2018-10-18 18:08:03 then this why I been dreading to get an oil change cause I hate sitting here
3653 2018-10-18 18:08:00 Then you mix with palm oil and boiled egg to complete the ritual.
3654 2018-10-18 18:07:59 I just saw this weird hair oil commercial and the lady said with a straight face “I just put the oil on my hair and it shines” word? Oil makes things shiny? golly
3655 2018-10-18 18:07:46 It’s red panty night
3656 2018-10-18 18:07:31 Oil change after work
3657 2018-10-18 18:07:21 I heard coconut oil takes them right off
3658 2018-10-18 18:07:21 The people who murdered Jamal Khashoggi, and whoever ordered it, are butchers.

Propagandists who support the butchers are equally repulsive.

Try civilization for a change. All the oil money in the world can’t make people civilized when they insist on acting like monsters.

3667 2018-10-18 18:05:57 What have you done? You are sabotaging Obama care with no better alternatives. You’re trying to close planned parenthood. You belittle women in public for your satisfaction. Your snake oil salesmen to max.
3668 2018-10-18 18:05:51 And Soros is whispering in  Trudeau's ear, you can can be better than Obama.

Kill oil industry
Kill industrial  output
Disarm the public.
Erase your culture with mass immigration

NO THANKS!
3669 2018-10-18 18:05:44 The usual tactics used by the bureaucracy to scare the politicians to make bold decisions to end corruption These officials serve the interests of the oil and gas mafias and not the state!
3670 2018-10-18 18:05:35 0.5% of the amount goes to the charity right away. Then invest into oil companies or multi-nationals, depends on how the market or stocks of the companies are doing and build an empire of my own on the side.Keep on making money through money and keep on doing (charityallyourlife)
3671 2018-10-18 18:05:32 When you shampoo focus on your scalp not the ends. Make sure your shampoo doesn’t have sulphates in it as that can dry out your hair. Do you use heat? Try and avoid it if you can. Do you use a leave in conditioner? Oil alone doesn’t moisturise the hair 2/2
3672 2018-10-18 18:05:30 Only because you have money more than me
3673 2018-10-18 18:05:27 @nitin_gadkari Sir, Request you to focus on electric cars. Promote them by provide bonus like no RTO tax, less or no road tax, less or no sales tax. This will help reduce the burden in increasing crude oil expenditure. And this will increase the culture of use of electric car
3674 2018-10-18 18:05:27 I can't eat palm oil at all, allergic to coconut and seemingly all things palm except for bannanas.
3675 2018-10-18 18:05:12 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.

3685 2018-10-18 18:04:16 Maybe U.S. could invade and fix it like we did in Iraq and Afghanistan LMAO, do they have oil?
3686 2018-10-18 18:04:06 At the moment on my skin I’m using turmeric powder mixed with coconut oil which seems to benefit it at the moment would it be a good idea to use same but oil pulling
3687 2018-10-18 18:04:06 Yam and palm oil. Those igbo palm oil.
3688 2018-10-18 18:04:04 They are pumping out like 12-13 million barrels of oil everyday! Do you have any idea any interruption to that would mean to the world economy? Especially now when the Iranian oil isn’t getting out!!
3689 2018-10-18 18:04:02 I hate getting my car serviced with a passion. I was expecting just an oil change and tire rotation. How TF is my bill $270

3691 2018-10-18 18:03:57 And so you should! Don't let anyone tell you these cars are gas-guzzling #UrbanBattleTank's for suburban driving.
An #EV can only cover 99% of your needs; these cars ensure that my petrol-producing friends & fellow oil shareholders are kept well fed! Thanks for your contribution!
3692 2018-10-18 18:03:50 Dat zou kunnen maar ik geef EUSSR meer kans met de ‘resolutie van strassbourg’. Oil for immigrants zal en moet door gedrukt worden. En mijn onderbuik heeft altijd gelijk. Overigens kan ik mijn niets van NL vluchtelingen tijdens wo2 herinneren.
3693 2018-10-18 18:03:43 U refused to give me money

3705 2018-10-18 18:02:08 No. There are def cases where we use CBD oil as a medicine for children. I see about 10 children a week alone in this practice. Very severe cases.

3708 2018-10-18 18:01:59 I think India will be selling oil back to Canada after refining. That is what Mr. Andrew Scheer called Value Added Service.
3709 2018-10-18 18:01:55 Why are you angry?
3710 2018-10-18 18:01:48 Wow! You will sell anything. Modern day snake oil salesman. Thanks for continually showing us that you belong to the party that will shamelessly lie, and steal, and cheat.
3711 2018-10-18 18:01:33 I also switched banks for a higher interest savings account, but thankfully new bank is a co-op who doesn't invest in oil or guns and buys conservation land.
3712 2018-10-18 18:01:27 Why would you not support off shore drilling? We need to be oil independent. We can’t trust foreign countries to supply us. Look at what’s happening in Saudi.

3714 2018-10-18 18:01:23 People forget the Saudis are wealthy because....of all the Oil they sell to the US and western world. Saudi insiders are already saying Saudi Arabia could potentially force the cost of a barrel of oil up to $400  a barrel in response to sanctions. 4x more than present cost.

3721 2018-10-18 18:01:12 it's actually so much fun to incorporate facial oil into ur makeup routine.. It makes the whole look so much more glossy and soft and all things nice. The traditional way of applying products just leaves my face looking cakey and dehydrated, so I'm happy with this new change
3722 2018-10-18 18:01:00 Do u think if u let Iran finished there Nuclear we will be alright !!! Saudi money decline your unemployment rate from 9 to 3.5% and rise the oil prices to 80’s $ for you . They invest more than 200 b for you and you want Iran to do the experiment!!!!
3723 2018-10-18 18:01:00 Did he also add olive oil to his moisturizing  routine? He is glistening!
3724 2018-10-18 18:00:34 Dems want to rush to judgement again. But this time with the possibility of crashing the world economy. Everyone and everything is affected by the cost of oil.
3725 2018-10-18 18:00:31 Thank you so much what oil do you use?

3729 2018-10-18 18:00:18 What is the reason behind embarking on oil exploration in the North when the refineries are not working?. Can someone tell me what I need to know about this @segalink @obyezeks @MoghaluKingsley @APCNigeria @akandeoj @GarShehu
3730 2018-10-18 18:00:13 You really have no idea. WE DONT NEED SOLAR. We have renewable electricity with hydro. Solar panels only last for about 30 years. What's the alterior motive to push solar with you guys. Also oil and gas been in the energy game a lot longer than you
3731 2018-10-18 18:00:11 I think mine needs anointing oil . needs spiritual deliverance

3733 2018-10-18 18:00:05 Not at all surprised. When you're in the deep pockets of the oil and gas lobby it's amazing what can be done to destroy our environment when solar and wind power are not only economical but renewable. But sleep good at night knowing you traded our children's future for profits!
3734 2018-10-18 17:59:56 What was the name of the bill for $10 a barrel tax on oil he voted yes on?  Oh, wait, there never was one.
3735 2018-10-18 17:59:48 I think you mean to be responding to trumps trade war with Canada, who provides the majority of our oil.... but you wouldn’t know that. That requires research and education.

3739 2018-10-18 17:59:26 So you are bored, Scots indy person, google the happiness scales of those countries in the EU with a similar sized population of Scotland, their pension age and rates, median incomes and GDP per capita without oil and a neighbour controlling their finances.

Indy is Triage.

3753 2018-10-18 17:58:41 Any sanctions against the Saudis has to take in consideration of the possibility of crashing the world economy. Unfortunately oil is the life blood of everything.
3754 2018-10-18 17:58:38 That's so sad! 
The worst is that our leaders are not just interested. They are all greedily busy scrabbling for oil. 
3755 2018-10-18 17:58:35 I've legit seen oil people upset because of tax credits for tech industry that should be for helping out the oil industry.........

3758 2018-10-18 17:58:17 I use rosehip seed oil and it works but it takes a loooong time
3759 2018-10-18 17:58:08 Think of a world w/o Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon...no bombs, airstrikes, mass genocide, no major military aggression. A country’s oil wld hv to be paid 4 rather than kill the citizens to steal it. A lot fewer 1%rs chomping 4 the next war to start. No regime changes. Peace.

3766 2018-10-18 17:57:34 It's not a con George but yes oil is worth a lot more than gas, however even at the current $3.26 for the gas the 763 BCF 2C has a sales value of $2.5 billion with very little uplift cost.

3769 2018-10-18 17:57:27 Is CBD oil psychoactive?

CBD Oils. Some sources will refer to CBD oils as cannabis oils, which can muddy the waters. Any oil that is CBD-dominant is a CBD oil, and it produces different effects from THC-dominant cannabis oils. This is because the compound is non-psychoactive.
3770 2018-10-18 17:57:24 we all settling down after Oil Spill? 
3771 2018-10-18 17:57:16 To be honest, I think with my severe anxiety, the oil not much effect, but the waxes different story!, especially the indica strain, in my case this is definitely the way forward:)
3772 2018-10-18 17:57:13 I don't know about "best way" but the way I've seen them prepared in most African countries is to simmer them in seasoned water until all the water has evaporated and then frying them in butter or oil. In Asia they deep fry them.
3773 2018-10-18 17:57:08 Fml imma do my oil change myself I ain’t waiting over an hour for something that takes less than 20 minutes to do 
3774 2018-10-18 17:57:02 Interesting to see oil go down. I am convinced that 10 years ago it would have been up with the Saudi story.

3780 2018-10-18 17:56:13 Definitely true that #infrastructure can  access to services &  costs of goods. At the same time, new transpo infrastructure in areas affected by #conflict can  exposure to violence by increasing/facilitating reach of armed groups (e.g oil infrastructure in the 90s).

3801 2018-10-18 17:54:44 Wonder if Oil will revisit?
3802 2018-10-18 17:54:38 It’s called oil.  They take their supply off our market and oil goes to 150-200 and than we are in a deep recession.

3812 2018-10-18 17:53:49 Wait! .. So with all the billions phone companies are making in Nigeria there’s not one phone factory in the country. 
-62 years after oil was discovered we  still can’t survive without importing petrol.

3813 2018-10-18 17:53:42 of course when you're led deeper and deeper in insolvency every snake oil salesman comes crawling up with miracle cures but chi was not improved after releasing assets some would say worse now, we need solutions not more gadgets and charms #ctpolitics
3814 2018-10-18 17:53:39 All it takes is 1 smart oil producer to start selling oil for silver and it's "GAME OVER". Now finding a smart non-captured oil producer is another story.

3816 2018-10-18 17:53:27 . Market watchers did not fall for Saudi Arabia’s empty threat, and oil prices actually have declined so far this week on growing inventories.
3817 2018-10-18 17:53:22 อ่าวหรอ?
3818 2018-10-18 17:53:20 In the past, geopolitical instability in the Middle East triggered 3 global recessions:
1.1973 Yom Kippur War
2.1979 Iranian revolution
3.1990 Iraq invasion of Kuwait

The oil prices spike due to supply disruption that triggered the recessions.
3819 2018-10-18 17:53:19 @realDonaldTrump MR DON USA AND MANY COUNTRIES NEED SAUDI

BODY IS CUT  KILLED INSIDE CONSULATE
3820 2018-10-18 17:53:18 So what you're saying is, when the oil runs out we are still fighting for the pure silica, the trace minerals, the coltan, etc etc etc and no real fundamental improvement in the war / no war situation can be expected, because it's the fundamental basis of capitalist recuperation.
3821 2018-10-18 17:53:17 (I don't really get along with cooking unless it's reaaaally simple stuff and it doesn't involve oil in a pan because i'll be running screaming if that hot stuff touches my skin )
3822 2018-10-18 17:53:14 The US cannot afford to endanger this source of oil by protesting about human rights concerns, just like Iran cannot afford to endanger its trade with China by doing the same.
3823 2018-10-18 17:53:12 It won’t be. :)  if you’ve followed oil drills from the uk for the last 30 years you can see that Portland and Kimmeridge are fast reduce zones. Ie small light natural fractures with oil. Ie the comes quickly comes out and then slows to a trickle. Hence the need for water flood.

3833 2018-10-18 17:52:28 #Iran’s customers are supposed to be winding down their purchases of Iranian oil, not increasing them. Officially, the US is still committed to “zero” #Iranian exports on the market, but it seems unlikely the US will achieve this.

3836 2018-10-18 17:52:21 I wouldn't mind paying taxes if they didn't go on war&oil, meanwhile removing valuable community services which then get privatised. As they sell off whats left of our public services our taxes go up, not down. So where is that money going? Its certainly not helping the needy.

3850 2018-10-18 17:51:00 We're not in the middle east for oil. I mean, we might be stealing oil while we're there, but the war is an end in itself. We're there to make war, and to profit off of the process of making war, and to exploit their emerging markets.

That's how american imperialism works.

3852 2018-10-18 17:50:59 What does the price of cannabis have to do with oil prices? Literally wtf are you talking about? You could compare the price of anything to anything else. It's meaningless.

3854 2018-10-18 17:50:54 Also, oil is not moisture. It is not a conditioner either. That is all.

3857 2018-10-18 17:50:41 However, #American companies quickly found new customers for their #crude +oil, and exports rebounded almost entirely in September. US #oil has become more attractive, because #WTI has been trading at a significant discount compared to Brent
3858 2018-10-18 17:50:34 We need to understand that it’s impossible to agree/disagree 100% on everything. We still have disagreements on many issues: Jerusalem, OPEC and oil, Russia...etc. However, with all that, DJT is waaaaay better than the bastard BHO who fucked up pretty much everything in the ME.
3859 2018-10-18 17:50:33 For the perfect manicure, you need a Base + Top coat, Cuticle oil & corrector pen!
3860 2018-10-18 17:50:33 My car is running so smooth now that I got my oil changed ... feel like I’m riding on the magic carpet ... it’s like my back tires not even on the ground... just floating and gliding
3861 2018-10-18 17:50:33 The biggest geopolitical mystery of our time is why SA is so untouchable. Is it 'just' oil? I doubt it. Makes them important, but enough to get away with out in the open? I think there's more behind it.

3864 2018-10-18 17:50:05 love seeing dad’s on twitter while i wait for my oil change
3865 2018-10-18 17:50:00 why are walking around?

i have never heard you shouting/rally/gherao etc....
3866 2018-10-18 17:49:58 Who is going to deliver my oil change coupons?
3867 2018-10-18 17:49:56 It's a narrative. Considering that Iran sanctions start in 2weeks I would start there. Kind of hard to stop use of Iranian oil when SA is imploding then there is the new alliance that was supposed to be announced soon with Israel. Turkey and Russia in the region. Take your pick.
3868 2018-10-18 17:49:52 Even if they don't feature olive oil, publish it!
3869 2018-10-18 17:49:39 WP Word of the Day: #Oil
3870 2018-10-18 17:49:38 Only half of oil is burned. The rest go to synthetics - such as the carbon fiber blades on wind the turbines. 

The oil burned in internal combustion engines accounts for only 14% of global greenhouse gas emissions. 

Energy: 26%
Industry: 24%
Agriculture: 24%

Wrong battle here.
3871 2018-10-18 17:49:37 I’m sorry Rosie that people have treated you so badly. I always knew you were  % correct about Trump ever since you called him a snake  oil salesman!
3872 2018-10-18 17:49:33 Energy solutions Not controlled by agencies like DOE are unacceptable. Rick Perry is a charlatan - an oil industry beneficiary
3873 2018-10-18 17:49:31 For some time now, traders and the oil industry were wondering when America’s ongoing trade dispute with #China would impact the Asian country’s imports of US #crudeoil, those fears were realized when #China cut its oil imports from the US to zero from 384,000 bpd in June
3874 2018-10-18 17:49:29 It should ultimately end with the nationalisation of Reliance without paying a single rupee. Start with their beginning  from false insurance claim and diverting crude oil from ONGC pipes under water to their tankers and selling the same to Indian govt.
3875 2018-10-18 17:49:26 Thanks! Wow, some surprising ingredients in there (soybean oil and oyster extracts) hmm

3879 2018-10-18 17:49:04 So how much oil do we get from Canada?  And how much from other countries? Facts really do matter!
3880 2018-10-18 17:49:02 Eggman's candy has the texture of a creamy egg, the smell of motor oil, and the taste of bitter defeat.
3881 2018-10-18 17:49:00 I don't claim to be a Christian, and I see Religion as what it is, Corporate Big Business. A Non-Profit Corporation, is still a corporation, they just get away with not paying taxes. These are Con men, with a license to steal, and they distribute their own brand of snake oil.
3882 2018-10-18 17:48:59 When I was dx’ed with GBM (Gord Downey, John McCain, many others) I did a lot of research on CBM oil, it can help with symptoms, but there is no solid proof it’s reducing/ preventing tumours. I was gonna try CBM when I get the shakes, but decided to stick with other meds.
3883 2018-10-18 17:48:58 Wow so the day I decide to wear white , I spill oil on my shirt , I mark on my sleeve with a black pen , then I squirt ketchup all up the sleeve . Just great . Guess this is why you don’t wear white after Labor Day . It’s bad luck or sum

3889 2018-10-18 17:48:31 The #US oil industry is proving more robust than expected. The #EIA is now forecastingthat shale oil production will increase by 98,000 bpd in November. It also raised its forecast for 2019 US oil production by 300,000 bpd to 11.8 million bpd.

3892 2018-10-18 17:48:18 Just keep rubbing oil and lotion on it. It’ll be uncomfortable but worth it, I learned the hard way!
3893 2018-10-18 17:48:12 2 things that will help you get good sleep, 1.. CBD oil, one of its many benefits, google it, buy it online easily

2.. Magnesium, a 400 mg. Supplement  in the evening, helps with a deeper sleep

Good luck, dm me if you want..
3894 2018-10-18 17:48:10 So when US soldiers are killed while protecting oil (not our freedom) it doesn't count? You right wingers are so intellectually vacant, if you fell into a "think tank" you'd drown.
3895 2018-10-18 17:48:09 Afghanistan has barely started tapping into their oil. We entered Afghanistan because that’s where OBL was hiding and where the Taliban was. Iraq was more of the bs war
3896 2018-10-18 17:47:58 Homemade.... without the oil... Buy a air fryer I've been using for some year's now very good for the health.

3899 2018-10-18 17:47:23 I recently came across a 2017 Altima that was discovered (on its first oil change) to be leaking trans fluid. Garbage cars.

3909 2018-10-18 17:47:01 Khoshoggi’s murder cannot be dismissed by anyone who believes in justice, liberty and the rule of law. Because the Saudis buy our weapons and sell us oil, Americans are asked to turn their backs. What has happened to us?
3910 2018-10-18 17:46:57 Oil needs to be a lot more expensive so that ppl will rethink producing so much plastic garbage.
3911 2018-10-18 17:46:57 With roiling geopolitical tensions, a looming deadline for #Iranian sanctions, and general production concerns, there is no shortage of potential catalysts that can be used to blame the recent escalation in oil market price volatility.
3912 2018-10-18 17:46:51 Why don’t you guys cut off the fins and fry the koobi in the palm oil??
Next time add some kako and mackerel.

3915 2018-10-18 17:46:27 lol...Doc, should have def checked N2 that B4 he started speaking.  The chicken isn't the problem, its the refined oil&salts used2 prepare.  Simply replace those 2 items would go a long way. If only folks realized how preventable these diseases really are.

3918 2018-10-18 17:46:21 @IbeKachikwu good evening.please i will like to know why  the IOC's have not been encouraged to establish refineries in the Nigeria. Why not even as a prerequisite to owning  a major oil block.
3919 2018-10-18 17:46:16 I know. I get all my cannabis oil and viagra from her.
3920 2018-10-18 17:46:13 That's why I've had it with the "environmental" charities. They're in bed with the Dems and refuse to call out the oil corporations.  They're a complete joke.

3924 2018-10-18 17:45:46 A lot of that has to do with not eating peanut butter tho. The oil makes my skin break out like you wouldn’t believe.
3925 2018-10-18 17:45:45 Wow really I would be there in a heartbeat with a bottle of baby oil to pleasure your hot bod Juelz
3926 2018-10-18 17:45:42 We just signed a trade deal with Canada and we import more oil from them than Saudi Arabia. Protecting the steel industry was the national security threat, it's nothing personal with Canada.
3927 2018-10-18 17:45:33 Distribution of energy throughout the USA via #Solar. We don’t need centralized energy grid run by oil invested utilities. Get off the grid.
3928 2018-10-18 17:45:31 Your business collapsed when the country diversify from oil to agriculture? Pls explain ooo

3934 2018-10-18 17:45:00 My mom cakes be jumping. She uses box cake mix as a base. Then adds all kinds of other stuff. You can't even tell it's box cake. But I do know that butter is a key ingredient in it. Fuck that vegetable oil it calls for.
3935 2018-10-18 17:44:57 loved being actually laughed at by the person at the home heating oil company when I asked if they had any deliveries available today
3936 2018-10-18 17:44:53 and most of them ignore climate change-- especially the right leaning ones that get money from the oil companies, Koch brothers, Saudi Arabia, etc
3937 2018-10-18 17:44:52 What a load of propaganda. Of course Canadian banks will have more oil, gas and natural resource risk. Canada is a natural resource country. It’s like criticizing Cdn banks for not having any pineapple risk. That risk would be held by Hawaiian bank. Retards. #onpoli
3938 2018-10-18 17:44:51 When you’ve waited to long to get an oil change and you finally call and have to wait another week for service <<<

3952 2018-10-18 17:43:23 Observations on Texas: 
1) It’s its own country. All the brands are Texan brands, from bottled water to whattaburger. All the engineers went to Texan schools. 
2) There is a greater understanding of both macro and microeconomics due to oil politics.
3953 2018-10-18 17:43:22 Just popped two fish oil pills and I am FADED
3954 2018-10-18 17:43:16 What a ridiculous poll, I support oil for medical treatment only, But cannabis will have a bad affect on Health and wellbeing eventually, and will have an bad affect on people around them.
3955 2018-10-18 17:43:15 Trial member,  would be nice if we could ask questions.
Would like a current up date on Crude Oil,  WTI.
Thank you
3956 2018-10-18 17:43:12 Do the “sno flakes” out there understand that any additional charges added to a barrel of oil are just past onto the consumer?

3962 2018-10-18 17:42:44 Ven is a perfect example of how corporate interests ruined a country. Our cia interfered w elections, helped destroy their economy. Bush wanted tariff free oil, but chavez needed tariffs to finance bricks & milk program. Chavez gave heating oil free to the poor.

3971 2018-10-18 17:42:09 Here's video of Trump saying Saudi Arabia was raising oil prices because "we have nobody in Washington who sits back and says 'you're not gonna raise that fucking price, you understand me?'" That's right, Trump complained about America not being tough on the Saudis. Enter Donald.

3975 2018-10-18 17:41:35 Daniel, don't you see a distinction between patronizing the Saudis (such as, let's say, buying oil and gasoline) and allowing the Saudis to patronize US business, such as paying for an entertainment show? Does a business absorb morals through its customers?  Meanwhile, you drive.

3979 2018-10-18 17:41:08 The Hall trade will go down as one of the worst ever and should have led to Chiarelli’s firing. The Oil badly diagnosed their problems. Imagine their current roster but with Dubnyk, Schultz, Eberle and Hall.
3980 2018-10-18 17:41:06 Hi @hfalakshahi. No that is for crude oil and gas condensate. I prepared a report for @RadioFarda_ today and asked EIA's Peg Mackey about the differences.

3990 2018-10-18 17:40:13 We don’t need Saudi oil. But stability of the markets is a national security concern. What’s also a US national security concern is controlling the supply for countries like China as is their expansion across the Middle East and Africa.

Higher oil prices, region lnstability and bad blood, based on hearsay. And all to defend an anti-american journalist. Murder is wrong, but let's look ahead.
3998 2018-10-18 17:39:51 Perhaps by the application of some cooking oil?

4001 2018-10-18 17:39:49 When you develop an appetite for blood and get supplied weapons by the one that should curb you, who is dependent on your oil... It got overlooked when thousands of innocents are killed in #Yemen. But #Khashoggi murder exposes #Saudi for the bully they are

4003 2018-10-18 17:39:29 It’s all about money, profit, power, and economic positioning by oil cartels and the Masters of War. And then there is the Trump family shamelessly using the office to protect their Saudi investments. #25thamemdment

4005 2018-10-18 17:39:17 Oil and gas is more than poking a hole and building a well it still has to be transported to be processed. With 112 you still can’t put pipelines in to reach such places to process. All the wells and locations everyone is saying are the issues aren’t going to go anywhere.
4006 2018-10-18 17:39:14 Currently at @shoprite lugbe... Tecno is giving away smart phones and other prices ooo.

4007 2018-10-18 17:39:08 Another 1 year in Manufacturing sector would be great. Next is Oil & Gas.
4008 2018-10-18 17:39:07 They’re thriving amongst significant oil and gas development. They don’t come near people or camps. No nuisances. See them more in the last couple years than the previous 20. They’re adapting. I carry a .44mag to work.
4009 2018-10-18 17:39:05 Unpopular opinion... Olive oil tastes disgusting 
4010 2018-10-18 17:39:04 Heat up some vegetable oil and then scrub with kosher salt would be my approach
4011 2018-10-18 17:38:50 right looooool I probably barely put any oil in the pan 
4012 2018-10-18 17:38:49 We purchase 8% of our oil from Saudi Arabia.  How about y’all lay off the emotions and realize the complex situation at hand for our entire government.

4021 2018-10-18 17:38:23 Amazing oil! I love elemis 
4022 2018-10-18 17:38:17 i hate it when people hate on cbd oil / act like it's a joke when they don't know anything about it

because i literally cannot even do an instagram live video without worrying that the local government is going to come after us

 don't be part of the problem - be a solution!
4023 2018-10-18 17:38:09 The battle lines are clear. Koch Bros, Saudis and Russians and the  big oil lobby vs Chinese solar, IPCC, EV's and Paris accord. Subsidies for fossil fuels have been recognized as perverse since the 1970's but the oil lobby has succeeded in maintaining and expanding them.
4024 2018-10-18 17:38:07 US also didn’t sell arms to Cuba or need their oil.
4025 2018-10-18 17:38:03 Oh hon, are that flakey?  It’s all about oil & Iran - get woke
4026 2018-10-18 17:38:02 Thank you @DonSelway As a good friend of mine has put it to me.. I know I am being 'Palmed off' to a great extent but I still feel we have to keep trying, asking questions and speaking up. Otherwise there is no hope. Come on @Nestle please listen. We DONT SUPPORT PALM OIL. STOP
4027 2018-10-18 17:37:52 Trump is an idiot, of course China will devalue currency to offset the tariffs. However, there is a floor there, currency devaluation makes imported good and oil expensive for China so that may drive inflation and unrest. But CN is a fake economy any way, Trump may yet crash it
4028 2018-10-18 17:37:36 Rohrabacher is betraying CA beaches by supporting Trump's attempts to:

4033 2018-10-18 17:37:15 i love that CBD is the star of every new multi-level marketing scheme. you You think weed oil is cool? Let's see how you feel about it after you sit on the itchy rug in my living room for three hours and drink wine while I get you to give me too much money. "And it's organic!"
4034 2018-10-18 17:37:07 Maybe Trump should draw a red line, or go over and bow down to them? You can't just end relationships with Saudi Arabia. That would result in 200 dollars a barrel oil, and Iran and Russia taking over the Middle East. It's a delicate balance here
4035 2018-10-18 17:37:04 That seems a bit rhetorical.
4036 2018-10-18 17:37:03 Please. They need to sell oil just like we need to buy it. They actually need us more than we need them. MBS should not be rewarded by hob knobing  with American finance officials. They'll see it as approval and commit more atrocities.
4037 2018-10-18 17:36:42 Dropped my car off to get an oil change and i feel bad for whoever has to drive my car bc it desperately needs cleaned
4038 2018-10-18 17:36:42 So that‘s the price tag you put on your national dignity? 
(Asking for an oil producing country)
PS maybe you don‘t care because he was in your definition not white.
4039 2018-10-18 17:36:41 Great point indeed. Fracking has been the biggest part of suppressing crude oil prices since around 2010 or '11.

I do wonder if recent creeping up of crude price might skew the thinking of U.S. officials.
4040 2018-10-18 17:36:37 I alternate sometimes I use the tresemmè conditioner (vibrant naturals) or I use a Shea butter on I think the make is palmers. Shampoo if my hair is REALLY dirty or if it’s a new month I use a shampoo with peppermint oil or I’ll use a Shea butter shampoo (again palmers) 1/2
4041 2018-10-18 17:36:34 Subsidizing industry has been a market tool used by all governments since confederation, and before. Canada cannot thrive unless they have a proper sense of the world economy. Sometimes a little nudge is prudent, eg. Railway, phone, internet, tar sand oil... the list is endless
4042 2018-10-18 17:36:33 Many of those developed nations have a population less than New Jersey and get billions in north sea oil... of course they can pay for it.

Followed closely by the union members of all the other nationalised industries - and a handful of car makers.
They killed the British car & mining industries stone dead!

4053 2018-10-18 17:35:05 @SkyNews reporting that CEO of BP expects oil price to reach $100 a barrel which is apparently great news for UK but an absolute disaster for an independent Scotland. They’re taking the piss and it’s Scotland’s oil.

4058 2018-10-18 17:34:56 It’s always about the oil. It’s the dark liquid that flows through America’s veins. As Trump squeezes Iran's oil output, he needs the Saudis to pump more. otherwise there could be a gas hike before the mid-terms. The Saudis have him by the proverbials.

You can (and maybe have) a stack of this stuff at home. A little depot. If a roll is empty, you start the next. There is always another roll. Especially if you buy it in quantities like I did last time.

4126 2018-10-18 17:28:13 saudi arabia allows slavery. i am sure its cheaper for the west to have the oil drilled by slaves than to invest the money into conquering an unstable region and drill it themself. its an economical decision. wouldnt you agree?
4127 2018-10-18 17:28:03 Legit question.  (Just a guess but, I suspect this moral relativism has to do with money, arms and oil and the ability of said entities to enter deals worth millions to billions of dollars and #cult45 just goes along with dear leader).

4130 2018-10-18 17:27:54 Lol. Alberta remains the richest province in one of the richest countries of the world. Perhaps the oil sector isn't as crucial as it believes itself to be.
4131 2018-10-18 17:27:52 Oil is a world wide commodity and the Saudis control the price by controlling refineries. It's not about having it it's about refining it and its messy and hazardous so we leave it to them

4133 2018-10-18 17:27:28 Time to buy some cheap(er) heavy oil and watch gasoline prices potentially rise! @Big_Orrin  where are USGC gasoline stocks at right now?
4134 2018-10-18 17:27:25 Out of left field the #kremlincup DJ just played Only The Strong by Midnight Oil during the changeover of the Pavlyuchenkova v Kasatkina match here in Moscow.

4135 2018-10-18 17:27:22 why did no one tell me oil changes are this fucking expensive

4137 2018-10-18 17:27:13 the decade of the abandonment of the gold standard was eventful

-oil shock
-commodity crisis
and this;

"In March 1976 British Labour government was forced to seek help from the IMF, a familiar option for Third World countries but highly unusual for a developed western economy"

4141 2018-10-18 17:26:39 whenever oil or gas is involved there is corruption. I will vote to keep them as far away from Colorado as we possibly can. No we don't need them fracking here. Let them go to Oklahoma.. the reddest State there is.
4142 2018-10-18 17:26:33 @EricTrump Why are you sticking up for the Saudis? You have so much oil in your hair as it is we don't need their help.

4151 2018-10-18 17:25:44 What way? Alberta used up its conventional oil, and its oil sands oil doesn't compete with other oil in the world. The Alberta oil sector gets everything it wants, and treats Albertans like crap. Tailings ponds. Abandoned wells.
4152 2018-10-18 17:25:43 Every time I go get an oil change they be tryna get over  where is my uncle when I need him.
4153 2018-10-18 17:25:40 Drove by a sign that read “pumpkin spice oil change is back”

I have so many questions.
4154 2018-10-18 17:25:36 We gonna miss you guys please come? Your problem guys that you think you’re the centre of world! Wake up this is Saudi Arabia the largest oil producer and has the largest reservoir we do not need you! You do.

4158 2018-10-18 17:25:24 We provide the US with 43% of its oil, and a considerable amount of hydro electric power. We’re also your largest trading partner. Of course, I would not expect a xenophobic Trumper to know anything about the outside world.
4159 2018-10-18 17:24:59 I'm at @DeltaSonicWash getting an oil change. They tell me my air filter is in backwards and that I may need a new one.... Well, you were the last one to take it out and put it back in.
4160 2018-10-18 17:24:57 front of your car will blow up, girl go change that oil!
4161 2018-10-18 17:24:52 It’s good for the planet though... I know everyone seems to be concerned only with themselves these days, but wouldn’t it behoove us all to try to move away from fossil fuels a bit? I know that’s not good for big oil, but your kids and grandkids will appreciate it I promise
4162 2018-10-18 17:24:51 @realDonaldTrump @SenLindsayGraham We are about to see Saudi oil dry up.  Yes dry up. They have threatened USA with stopping arms deal and oil would rise.  They need the guns. God is about to step in and dry up Saudi oil. In the meantime we will find a huge oil find in the US.
4163 2018-10-18 17:24:43 This is like asking Hitler to explain concentration camps. We need Saudi Oil. We do not need Saudi student expel them and hope Europe follows suit. West should withdraw ambassadors. Did Turkey expel Saudi ambassador. If not why not. Buy Iranian oil. The hell with sanctions.
4164 2018-10-18 17:24:35 But Brett what about “*plant based alternative* that can replace that portion of HC demand?” Remember thAt oil and gas is highly compressed heat processes versions of plants that won’t require 140% of global arable land to produce (stat based on using hemp)

4177 2018-10-18 17:23:10 We are better off?  Trump-admin is DE-regulating industries that pollute our water and air. They ignore Climate Science in order to justify gov support, subsidies & tax-breaks for Oil & fracking, and they're trying to Give-Away our public forests & recreation areas to Big-Biz.
4178 2018-10-18 17:23:08 I know. I guess next move needs to be OPEC. They screw with oil prices and we need to be free from them.

4184 2018-10-18 17:22:45 Murphy said Saudi Arabia needs US more than US needs it because US not as dependent on foreign oil — independence (fracking/Keystone) the left has been fighting for years.
4185 2018-10-18 17:22:44 The Saudis, with the help of American oil billionaires are destroying our entire world as they suck our hard-earned cash into mansions and yachts. The country has been run by them for decades, barring a few offices, and we need to stop this strangle-hold on us!!

4199 2018-10-18 17:22:05 Thank you. I hope that cabinet members and Senators will convince @realDonaldTrump to change course against Saudi Arabia, despite our dependency on their oil and we must resist to weigh arms deals higher than basic decency.

4204 2018-10-18 17:21:40 The engine bay of a vehicle is very often overlooked when it comes to cleaning as it may be considered a ‘non essential’. Keeping your engine bay clean ensures that excess grease, oil and dirt is unable to build up and accumulate in and around important or sensitive parts.

4206 2018-10-18 17:21:31 I would not put anything past DT/Kushner on this

As far as political upside for US = cements relationship with powerful ally; reinforces #petrodollar; ensures future weapons sales to benefit military industrial complex; ensures cheap oil for US economy --> not enough to justify
4207 2018-10-18 17:21:22 Wow! I wonder if big oil has handed you any money to say these things and vote this way. It's amazing to think you would trade our Chesapeake Bay for economic gains.. all it takes is "1" mis-step AND we lose it all. Remember BP and the gulf? We don't want that here!!!!!!
4208 2018-10-18 17:21:22 You miss the key to their hold over the USA.
Go research the Petrodollar Mechanism to see why the Saudis get away with it when other oil nations do not.
4209 2018-10-18 17:21:21 This is great, congratulations!! Next move should be to ask Finland to stop pushing palm oil based biofuels. Bad for climate, bad for rainforests.

So Yes I believe that!
4215 2018-10-18 17:20:35 Had US pursued a more balanced policy toward KSA-Iran, it would today have options. There is nothing US can do to KSA w/out immediately jeopardizing Iran policy because if KSA refuses to increase oil production to make up for lost Iranian oil, world economy goes into recession.
4216 2018-10-18 17:20:27 but not with oil lol
4217 2018-10-18 17:20:25 Palm oil too

4222 2018-10-18 17:19:40 It’ll never happen. Bottom line:
They have the oil, we need it. End of story. Everything else you see is bullshit smoke and mirrors to project our dismay. Reality, we don’t really care, and we should.

4225 2018-10-18 17:19:32 Clearly a lot of folks want this energy transition hurried up. Because oil/gas industry has resisted sensible regulation repeatedly, now voters have had enough & have put it on the ballot. This initiative is of the industry’s own making.
4226 2018-10-18 17:19:29 And by “science” they mean “oil and coal agenda”. And by “overhaul” they mean “implement”.
4227 2018-10-18 17:19:27 Seemingly it's been that way since the beginning:

- Oil, about 18% of the world's supply
- Stable alliance in an unstable neighborhood
- Counterweight to Iran

Anything internal like little rights for women & none for gay people?

Crickets. "Matter of sovereignty" & all that.
4228 2018-10-18 17:19:22 Quote from #Khashoggi's last column (same thoughts I had while experiencing horrors in #Oman--they all get a pass bc of oil/$): “The Arab world is facing its own version of an Iron Curtain, imposed not by external actors but through domestic forces vying for power." #Saudi
4229 2018-10-18 17:19:21 Place 15-20 drops in 1 cup of cool water. Soak a soft washcloth in the mixture and gently place to cover the area. Hold it onto the forehead and repeat as necessary. For a low-grade fever (100-102 degrees Fahrenheit), add 15-50 drops of eucalyptus oil to a warm bath.
4230 2018-10-18 17:19:13 Hubz & I were recently discussing how men can’t discuss intimacy with each other.

4234 2018-10-18 17:18:59 We are not that reliant on Saudi gas.  After all, that's why we gave up so many environmental protections-   we were told by our 'leaders' that we needed to reduce dependence on foreign oil.  We've done that.  They represent 11% or so of our oil.

4242 2018-10-18 17:18:25 Gotta admit it doesn't matter who is in office--- Democrat or Republican-- we're not walking away from Saudi Arabia.

We need their oil-- and we need to sell our weapons.
4243 2018-10-18 17:18:22 I haven't added an oil to my rotation due to inertia, but I know a lot of people like them?
4244 2018-10-18 17:18:09 You could achieve so much and lead the way if you stopped asking pointless questions and put your efforts into moving away from palm oil #PalmOil #rainforestdestruction

4246 2018-10-18 17:18:03 Time to investigate how US politicians can get away with DUIs, while the rest of us would go to jail. Also, Gaetz seems to want eliminate the EPA. Is it BIG OIL money ?

4249 2018-10-18 17:17:48 This is good news for all electric auto manufacturers in the US.  After reading about the Saudis who murdered a journalist working for the Washington Post, the sooner we develop alternatives to oil, the better.

4259 2018-10-18 17:17:09 It's 11 o'clock do you know where your children are? Catholic priest has been giving kids their first free samples of wine every high holiday & nobody complains on the chemistry of that holy smoke or how many candles are lit taking my breath away. Expensive anointing with oil eh.
4260 2018-10-18 17:17:03 I’m gonna start telling the waitress i want “oil and the v-word” when she asks what dressing i want for my salad
4261 2018-10-18 17:16:58 I hate getting yelled at because I don’t get my oil changed enough or as often as I’m supposed too. MAYBE my car should stop adding miles to it. 
4262 2018-10-18 17:16:56 This is so great and helpful. How do you guys feel about Argan oil? (Throw back to beauty trends that are way outdated...)

4267 2018-10-18 17:16:34 That's literally the silliest argument I've heard.
You: saturated fat isn't harmful. But don't compare it to soy bean oil because that's too healthy. That would make SFA look bad. 

As if soy bean oil is some kind of super food...

So you would agree it's healthier? Good.
4268 2018-10-18 17:16:32 Isn't it about the Oil too? Pretty sure that and the arms deal.
4269 2018-10-18 17:16:26 Oil accounting 
4270 2018-10-18 17:16:20 I just pulled up at the place to get my cars oil change done and the was like are you sure?? And I was like would I be here if I wasn’t sure it needed to be done??!??!

4272 2018-10-18 17:16:08 Check your Engine oil today.
4273 2018-10-18 17:16:07 We do not recommend you oil the jog wheel by yourself because it could cause bigger issues. We ask all the customers to send the unit to an authorized service centre. That issue may be caused by other reasons, too.
4274 2018-10-18 17:16:04 For sure  I hope you feel better! 
Also worth saying that its super important to get the right strain too so someone there may be able to give a good rec. Lemme know how oil works out for you if you try it cause I've been thinking of moving in that direction too!
4275 2018-10-18 17:15:58 Late Shehu Yar'adua biggest oil thieve? This must be verified by other channels
4276 2018-10-18 17:15:50 You were sold a fantasy but currency short sellers and hedge fund managers you were manipulated and they used racism xenophobia and patriotism to sell snake oil to low information voters
4277 2018-10-18 17:15:35 How an oil change take an hour
4278 2018-10-18 17:15:29 Having to replace the battery & get an oil change  why is adulting so expensive 
4279 2018-10-18 17:15:25 Pretending from Oil of Every Pearl’s Un-Insides
4280 2018-10-18 17:15:20 “...through inaction and downright stupidity,” AND the campaign that underhandedly stigmatized the oil sands. Using millions of US $ channeled into Canada via fraudulent (but still lawful) “charities”. They choke off our oil pipelines — we must choke off their money pipelines.

4284 2018-10-18 17:15:10 Its a bigger question. Do we support our (the richest and most powerful of us) material interests or do we support ideals that we believe will benefit all. Long list of Saudi assaults on the world’s freedoms and our democratic ideals and we always choose guns, oil and money.
4285 2018-10-18 17:15:06 Why sad? Cooking oil pleereese
4286 2018-10-18 17:15:02 We don't care about your people whoever they will be. The most important thing to us is your oil ''Aramco''!
4287 2018-10-18 17:14:58 @realDonaldTrump Donald, you are awesome. Make us the largest exporter of oil and have oil touch 100 USD. Everyone should want our currency in the world and we should have trade surplus. I have got immense trust in you. We were feeding the world so far, thanks for changing that
4288 2018-10-18 17:14:57 Robert (Beto) O'Roarke wants open borders which will let in MS-13 gangs; to tax Texas oil which will ruin the Texas industry; and to kill unborn babies. #VetoBeto #ProLife
4289 2018-10-18 17:14:56 Trump:
"Saudi Arabia is our best ally.
They sell us billions of barrels of oil.
We sell them billions in weapons and other stuff.
Their Crown Prince was hurt with Fake News by a lying journalist, just like I am, but he went further defending himself than I can.
No one's perfect."
4290 2018-10-18 17:14:52 The Bush family.  Iran Contra.  Zapata Oil.  Same garbage since the beginning of time.
4291 2018-10-18 17:14:52 What would financial services analyst know about oil recovery? And how is he more qualified than SS to comment on this? Oh I do hate arrogance!
4292 2018-10-18 17:14:41 At the LPs they just make CO2 extract and then dilute it in edible oils. I skip the extra step by just extracting the decarbed dry herb straight into the oil.
4293 2018-10-18 17:14:40 skipped class to change my oil & hit the gym 
4294 2018-10-18 17:14:39 Why? 
Foods rich in SFA are typically low in n-3 and vit E. How would it be unfair to compare those foods to other foods?
It would be hard to not increase vit E. Perhaps if you compared palm oil to walnuts?? What would you suggest?
4295 2018-10-18 17:14:39 "Political Islam" is an American value?  The Muslim Brotherhood represent American values?
Only in the eyes of a propagandist / activist at the NY Times....
4296 2018-10-18 17:14:38 Said this for years! The money and the oil were just too “important”. They had to make someone “pay” so they went for Iraq. Which, ironically, the Saudis hated.
4297 2018-10-18 17:14:28 We respond by sanctioning the Saudis.
They respond by increasing oil prices.
Gas prices skyrocket.
The economy takes a nosedive.
The GOP gets blamed.
They lose more seats than they were going to anyway.

The US will do nothing about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.
4298 2018-10-18 17:14:25 Thats funnyyyyy bc I get free oil changes and tire rotations and my note is like less than a third of that

4306 2018-10-18 17:13:45 Seeds contain massive amounts of the anti nutrient phytic acid and are too high in omega 6’s which cause inflammation.  
Cottonseed oil (as well as canola oil) should NOT be consumed at all. Can’t imagine the seeds being beneficial at all.
4307 2018-10-18 17:13:38 Astrology and homeopathy are the modern day equivalent of snake oil treatments. Good for you that you’ve found someone to pay you to speak nonsensical mumbo jumbo. That people buy what you sell says more about people than about you.

4310 2018-10-18 17:13:30 Frakencinse oil is one of the best oils for hyperpigmentation which can occur more commonly with the more melanin you have.
4311 2018-10-18 17:13:30 Nope. You are spot on. Hence my comments about building resilience to prepare for the downturn when oil prices crash.
4312 2018-10-18 17:13:24 Who said war? Don't sell those terrorist supporters weapons. You do remember how they dropped the oil prices and killed our booming oil industry here a few years ago...

4319 2018-10-18 17:13:01 In Lyon butter was replaced with a canola oil margarine. It was rich in ALA, but then again that argument would be similar to the one he uses for Oslo. Unfair to compare foods rich in saturated fat with healthy foods... But that's exactly what people should look for.
4320 2018-10-18 17:12:50 The new Evergreen Spirit Blend pure essential oil scent is WONDERFUL! I was afraid it would smell like Pinesol, NOPE! It' an awakening blend of oils including orange, Siberian fir, and wintergreen! LOVE IT

4327 2018-10-18 17:12:08 Power still uses a ton of oil and gas to operate. We as humans suck there’s no doubt about it but to point the finger at one group for providing something used everyday by billions of people seems pretty counterintuitive
4328 2018-10-18 17:12:06 Damn yea i just do that too.. maybe she has sensitive skin ... they said olive oil too is good for babies
4329 2018-10-18 17:12:00 Boy those look good for our grandchildren to see in our national parks. And we dont need to ruin our water and land and trees for more oil.

4336 2018-10-18 17:10:53 Yes, #Beto supported a $10-a-barrel tax on oil!! TO BE PAID BY ENERGY COMPANIES!! They should be able to afford it since #Cruz voted to give said companies a HUGE tax break! Tell you WHOLE story!
4337 2018-10-18 17:10:47 Blood and Oil 
4338 2018-10-18 17:10:37 Wars and conflicts $$$. Arms  manufacturers & oil companies have their hand out first. With states, developers, city council and corporations work deals at the expense of taxpayers to “bring jobs”. I’m pro capitalism, but it has run amok at the expense of kids’ education.
4339 2018-10-18 17:10:23 actually this is interesting...reminds me of "the oil curse"... where economies with petroleum don't create non-petro businesses because oil is so lucrative. NY isn't going to create a pizza chain because banking is so lucrative. Ohio, etc, at the moment has few other options.

4353 2018-10-18 17:09:28 I use to think the oil went in the scrambled eggs rather than in the frying pan... that's one up from milk first then cereal.

4355 2018-10-18 17:09:13 The only way to stop oil from being supplied is to attack the demand, which is what mass adoption of EVs would do. Thus far, you guys waste your time & resources on fighting supply(pipelines), which does zero on fighting worldwide oil consumption. More solutions, less protesting.

4369 2018-10-18 17:08:23 Yep for 8 yrs Obama is a Muslim out to destroy America (he wasn’t) but we love the Saudi elites who sppt’d terror groups that killed Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan cause we need their oil and money. Morons live in alt reality to feel good about themselves.

4371 2018-10-18 17:08:03 This is a ideal middle ground for Chinese government who are trying to get US oil majors to help them develop the country's energy import infrastructure without getting in the middle of the tariff war. 

ExxonMobil in the context of this project is a "namesake" US company.

4384 2018-10-18 17:06:47 Maybe I don't get it but I always argue that a key portion of non-oil, services & trade, is driven largely by the oil industry(revenues)

Why the non-oil shrink when oil takes a tumble. 

Am I missing something?

4392 2018-10-18 17:06:15 forcing black people into "forgiveness" is how they force us into submission. Why don't they ask if we forgive the DAILY pillaging of african resources (rare earth, diamond, gas, oil..) and the millions of deaths due to the pillaging/ war by proxy? black holocaust is real
4393 2018-10-18 17:06:10 We didn't go into recession when oil prices fell because other sectors were still producing.

We went into recession when productivity in non-oil sectors was impacted by Buhari's defensive decisions.

This is the simple economic fact that Buharists are trying to deny.
4394 2018-10-18 17:06:10 .@BGriveaux aggressive and confrontational approach to palm oil is disappointing. Better to focus on the positive, mutually beneficial trading relationship between Malaysia and France.

4396 2018-10-18 17:05:54 Heaven forbid we protect playgrounds and they are acting as if we need to “apply” to do so. Oil and gas contracts are complicated enough. How about they simply do the right thing? School boards who have voted for 2,000 foot setbacks are ignored again. Can we mention explosions?

4402 2018-10-18 17:05:08 Lol. If you're a liberal, you have no American values. It's like oil and water. They don't mix. That's why you guys want to change everything that makes this country great. You can't name one thing that Trump has done that is actively destroying our constitution. Just another LIE
4403 2018-10-18 17:05:06 It is not about the oil. 
the USA is self-sufficient in energy.
You really need to learn about the Petrodollar mechanism.

4406 2018-10-18 17:04:46 It says that Texans care about TX values & like this booming economy. We like our tax cut crumbs & being a big energy/oil producer. And it says “Don’t California my Texas.”

is trump doing private $$ business with them?

4417 2018-10-18 17:03:58 Damian - If by "socialist" you mean communist - Venezuela was never that.
They were too dependent on oil, may have had problems with corruption, have been victims of embargoes from USA and coup attempts from extremist right wingers that seem to be backed by USA.

4450 2018-10-18 17:01:04 @MikeHudema I’m sincerely glad you got an EV, my lungs thank you for it, we love ours but as long as the world demands oil like you did up until your EV purchase, it should be Canadian oil, not 3rd-world despot oil being supplied to meet that demand.

4467 2018-10-18 16:59:59 My conservative right-leaving husband laughed at that within seconds. He knew right away they were full of propaganda. It’s no wonder the oil and gas industry isn’t trustworthy. Never has been. Never will be.

4507 2018-10-18 16:56:21 Oil Prices continued to trade at their low lows, due to bigger-than-expected gains in American stockpiles, and overshadowed tensions between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia over a missing critic of the kingdom

4519 2018-10-18 16:55:18 No doubt that there are still linkages between the oil and non-oil economies in the oil producing states. 

Economists should be able to help measure the sensitivity of the non oil economy in these states to oil shocks. 

Then they can make plans to build resilience.
4520 2018-10-18 16:55:17 Yeah but all of these things could've already been done 10 or more years ago. There wasn't anything holding it back apart from the oil and car industry.

4526 2018-10-18 16:55:03 Oh. And those oil revenues? Generated by capitalism.
4527 2018-10-18 16:54:59 A6 My fam also loves thin spaghetti with "zoodles". A tasty way to make half the meal veggie. Just cook pasta as directed, toss the zoodles into the pasta pot 2 minutes before pasta is done. Drain, top with a little olive oil & grated Parmesan or Romano cheese. #AskPastaFits
4528 2018-10-18 16:54:54 I’m quite certain we can do both.  The entire world has demand for petroleum products.  Even if all of Canada went EV and we were all off grid solar wind and whatnot. Oil demand worldwide is growing.
4529 2018-10-18 16:54:42 I prefer groundnut oil to power oil

4531 2018-10-18 16:54:37 Hi Patricia - thank you for your question! Used cooking oil does not have a drop off location in Williams Lake at this time. Do you have a small household volume or a larger volume from a business?

4533 2018-10-18 16:54:22 Follow the oil...
4534 2018-10-18 16:54:16 Getting my oil changed... praying they don’t pop my tire... again 
4535 2018-10-18 16:54:09 Ow! Terrible news. May Allah forgive him and grant him Paradise. My thoughts are with his family and friends
4536 2018-10-18 16:54:06 Black Jamaican Castor Oil is Heaven. I haven’t tried the others.
4537 2018-10-18 16:54:06 I agree totally. The world needs to know what these barbarians did. They can take their oil and stick it.
4538 2018-10-18 16:54:04 Absolutely looks like an oil  painting....
4539 2018-10-18 16:54:01 I follow a local company who are licensed to create high grade CBD oil exactly for this purpose, kids w/epilepsy. The name is Compassionate Cultivation, their # (512) 614-0343, you can find them on Facebook.
4540 2018-10-18 16:54:00 Everyone that has taken our cannabis products has reduced or quit taking many meds. The Holy oil, the Extreme oil, and the Tincture (rich in cannabis terpenes). Each causes immediate pain relief and heals much of the damage from Big Pharma. Breaks addictions, cleans the body.
4541 2018-10-18 16:53:59 Even after trillions of dollars generated by oil revenues over several decades, #SaudiArabia is still a primitive and barbaric, desert tribe.
4542 2018-10-18 16:53:52 Castor oil!
4543 2018-10-18 16:53:51 President Trump doesn't seem to care much about global markets. We have our own oil.
4544 2018-10-18 16:53:49 Oil and greed are the problems. But don't worry, it will be finished soon and, if humanity survives, you arabs will have pease. Inshallah

4546 2018-10-18 16:53:25 Dubya did us zero favors by declaring “war” on two uninvolved countries, thereby burying the truth in a miasma of disinformation meant to open the door for oil interests and regime change. In other words, no justice.
4547 2018-10-18 16:53:22 So, let's start w daytime routine: I only use oil cleansing as my skin is super sensitive and nothing else works, I usually do that or just some micellar water. Follow up w toner, daytime serum, oil, moisturizer, and sunscreen. Sunscreen is the #1 thing you can do to prevent -
4548 2018-10-18 16:53:08 Alaska is able to provide $2,072 per person per year and only because of its oil revenues and low population. What happens when the profits generated in the economy run dry? I'll answer for you: Venezuela.
4549 2018-10-18 16:53:06 Please note all our honey, dates and blackseed oil products are all organic.

4554 2018-10-18 16:52:32 ใช่
4555 2018-10-18 16:52:26 Sombhit dada's work is to yell baseless allegations on others in news debates... Because of his orator-ship,he was appointed as Ind.director of big psu , he doesn't have any background of oil/gas industry...
4556 2018-10-18 16:52:22 Oil money !!
4557 2018-10-18 16:52:19 How about asking Iran for oil on deferred payments as well?
4558 2018-10-18 16:52:16 The amount of money you would spend on oil change is already worth another car
4559 2018-10-18 16:52:10 You mean like the good, paying jobs available in the oil patch? Real jobs that don't require gov't subsidies like so-called "renewables" or film? @NMOilAndGas @IPANewMexico @RioGrandeFndn
4560 2018-10-18 16:52:03 That’s exactly why they collapsed. The oil market collapsed and now inflation has rose by 2068% because of how far left policies
4561 2018-10-18 16:52:02 Haaa Gutu wakugona manje waonaka kut iwe wainanzva garo neni ndaisananzva takushaya mazowe, fuel ne cooking oil wakuda kunyepedzera kutendeuka
4562 2018-10-18 16:51:56 Due for an oil change damn it
4563 2018-10-18 16:51:51 Buckle up. This is no small issue when oil is involved.
4564 2018-10-18 16:51:49 gas & oil automation disturbance all over india .
4565 2018-10-18 16:51:42 Just a question, have you tried CBD oil. It is a medicine that God put on this earth. There are healing plants that we call weeds growing in our yards that heal every ailment that we have. It's just one of the many gifts that God gives us.
4566 2018-10-18 16:51:37 How many hours per week do you regularly work, including midnight oil burning? #Work #Workload
4567 2018-10-18 16:51:36 Nah my doctor never used an oil and she didn’t rub like this- she still was able to find two lumps- one in each breast but she was more concerned with my left side....
4568 2018-10-18 16:51:34 @princefhbin Sorry for my selfconfians.
Here are more olive oil, water, and every economics projects for world gastronomí interested.
Thanks for the atention 
4569 2018-10-18 16:51:34 Africa Oil $AOI.to poop price action, but fundamentals will win out.  Trading at cash again. Great R/R at these levels.
4570 2018-10-18 16:51:32 The Sauds were a crime family until the 1920s, oil made them rich. Royalty is a joke.

4573 2018-10-18 16:51:28 "Trump makes me do bad things!"

4574 2018-10-18 16:51:26 Saudi Arabia sell us shiploads of oil and we sell them tons of weapons,  So Khashoggi or a 1,000 Khashoggi’s more will not be any different!  The U.S will do jack shit!     Ah, But had it been Venezuela or Cuba... #ThursdayThoughts
4575 2018-10-18 16:51:25 Say what you want about the economy but @maddiewazowski just bought 150 gallons of oil for $4.50
4576 2018-10-18 16:51:14 I just made the baddest palm oil rice ever.
4577 2018-10-18 16:51:14 Dana, 
Tell us How.. as a former beach & surf dude ... you end up betraying CA beaches by supporting the Trump admin attempts to put Oil rigs along our Coasts and Frack our Land, and De-Regulate carbon-emissions & #ClimateChange pollution? 
Need a Rep to Protect our #Environment
4578 2018-10-18 16:51:13 You stupid glad you never made it as a president. 2 questions for you. 1 he was seen walking into the embassy voluntarily, what was his mission? 2 what would happen to every American if the Saudi's cut oil production and raised the price of oil? He went on his own steam
4579 2018-10-18 16:51:06 Also coco oil, & garlic, topically, as a suppository & eating it! Garlic is magic
4580 2018-10-18 16:51:02 my pap took my car to get new tires today and also filled up my tank, my oil, my antifreeze and cleaned my windows. a genuine angel on earth 
4581 2018-10-18 16:51:00 i’m getting my oil changed for the first time ever and i’m so embarrassed bc i literally know nothing
4582 2018-10-18 16:50:57 De hecho siempre fue la tirada. El Oil Shale no es de buena calidad para usarlo como combustible. El plástico es una mejor opción, además que la industria del petroleo es básicamente la misma que la del plástico.
4583 2018-10-18 16:50:44 Hmmmmm .... pak should accept responsibility for kashohgi .... wat do u say? MBS happy .... we get free oil and 10 billion USD as cherry on top. Hell they might even give us more
4584 2018-10-18 16:50:44 If you don't spend time with #God, the oil in your lamp will go out.
4585 2018-10-18 16:50:41 If made in plant based oil ye
4586 2018-10-18 16:50:41 Came in for an oil change to find out that my car battery was close to dying 
4587 2018-10-18 16:50:38 เอาไปทิ้งเร็ว
4588 2018-10-18 16:50:35 Going to be doesn’t mean they are. Why is that though? If the renewables are so readily available? It’s not my fault you use the stuff. Acting like you don’t use a drop of oil or gas products.
4589 2018-10-18 16:50:34 The U.S. and G.B. installed the Shah. I think it was over oil. The U.S. and G.B. fucked up. But that was then. Agreed terrorism isn't big issue. It's nukes. U.S. is ready today to enter into a new deal that really stops nuke proliferation. It is in Iran's interest to do so.
4590 2018-10-18 16:50:27 Cloves or clove oil
4591 2018-10-18 16:50:22 I do also agree with you that it’s a mean question. That setup *is* a call to do an algorithm! It’s like asking someone to make scones with flour and coconut oil and then getting upset at them for saying “No. Butter is better.” rather than “If you insist.”
4592 2018-10-18 16:50:22 ต้องเล่นที่บ้านพรีมเหรอ
4593 2018-10-18 16:50:18 @GovernorTomWolf's pathetic attack ads on @SenScottWagner's business and the oil and natural gas industries shows he doesn't care about businesses and working people in PA.
4594 2018-10-18 16:50:17 Big oil money talks !!
4595 2018-10-18 16:50:16 I scheduled an oil change at a specific time so that I wouldn’t miss work or class and now I’ve been here for three hours and missed a class lol. This week is so good
4596 2018-10-18 16:50:14 Getting active after this oil change 
4597 2018-10-18 16:49:57 At least you all are being followed by so called celebrities. I had an "rich" owner of offshore oil drilling cimpany who eventually asked for $ for his son who needed mental healthcare. 
4598 2018-10-18 16:49:57 Oil. 
4599 2018-10-18 16:49:51 @SenThomTillis @SenatorBurr @RepHolding if Saudis are guilty, what will you do to stop us from importing Saudi oil and other trade? What else do they have to do for us to cut them off? 911 #28pages, dismembering journalists? What is your action on this?
4600 2018-10-18 16:49:46 They never were. Just snake oil salesmen, like trump.
4601 2018-10-18 16:49:42 We would work for oil companies once we graduated and finished serving (being engineering graduates from better UNI) but see where we de today .......'aunty/uncle please open account; fix your money for xx months; have u heard of bla bla bla account' 

Blessed are the humble
4602 2018-10-18 16:49:19 People should stop supporting #BigOil, 
Trumps puppet masters. 
Walk, take the bus/train/bicycle, buy an EV for their next car, install solar panels. 
STOP buying oil, it's killing us.

4604 2018-10-18 16:49:02 @ElrushboRush Rush, my question is, why would the Saudi prince be on a campaign for investor money. When they have more oil money than you can shake a stick at! No, I think it’s more to sell the false premise that Saudi Arabia is turning a new leaf!
4605 2018-10-18 16:49:01 What if it's something like
Stories as medicine / healing
Look at the wounds
50 shades is snake oil: you're disconnected in sex and therefore unsatisfied, you need whips and chains to fix it
People flock.
Doesn't work, so forgotten in a decade.
4606 2018-10-18 16:48:57 When you work with flour and oil everyday the clear don't look good after a while. The cases don't even need to be white. Just more colors than black and rose gold
4607 2018-10-18 16:48:54 While we ourselves do not get the bulk of our oil from the Middle East, those countries hold a huge proportion of the global market. If we don't keep them happy, the market moves against us.
4608 2018-10-18 16:48:53 Go get that oil change sis and ask about a flush since it’s been so long you’re welcome
4609 2018-10-18 16:48:49 And wani tribe ne hausa/fulani
4610 2018-10-18 16:48:47 Am I the only American who thinks selling $100bn of weapons to Saudi Arabia is just arming future enemies? They're not our allies, have never been our friends. We want their oil. That's it. Why arm them?
4611 2018-10-18 16:48:40 I’m surprised oil hasn’t shot up on this news.
4612 2018-10-18 16:48:39 Time to burn the midnight oil lezgaw
4613 2018-10-18 16:48:38 If .Salman steps aside it makes future actions a lot easier for POTUS. Inaction by POTUS will significantly hurt him with voters more then he realizes. Our values & principles must be preserved over oil & $'s? 19 of 21 hijackers on 9/11 came from Saudi Arabia, no accountability
4614 2018-10-18 16:48:35 Vos hablas de López saliendo de la cárcel o de Oil combustibles saliendo de la quiebra?  me parece que no tiene solución!

4619 2018-10-18 16:47:59 Hey Newfoundland! The secret's out! So stop charging us an arm and a leg for gas and OIL based electricity
4620 2018-10-18 16:47:55 I don’t believe Khashoggi’s disappearance and alleged assassination will change US-Saudi relationship. It is an entirely transactional relationship that will change only when Shale will be encouraged and US dependence on Saudi oil will decrease.
4621 2018-10-18 16:47:52 As far as I know, there has not been one word of the Steele Dossier that has been debunked. But as for this oil deal, how many GOP lawmakers could have been in on it? Given that various reporting (including yours) have tied 42 to this mess, one wonders how many were in on this.
4622 2018-10-18 16:47:44 My ex wife once told me "Your oil field job is tearing is apart" I responded the only way I knew how "10-4"
4623 2018-10-18 16:47:42 You think being hard on the Saudi's is a walk in the park. All they have to do is cut oil production and the price of oil will go through the roof. Live in your dream world all you want. The guy clearly went voluntarily into the embassy. What was his mission
4624 2018-10-18 16:47:35 Facts and NDTV don't go together it's like water and oil.  You're not above the law. Your colleagues are named in series of crimes ranging from money laundering to tax evasion. Not to forget your channel's anti national stand and biased propaganda in favor of one family.

4627 2018-10-18 16:47:18 Coal, oil - nature’s form of carbon sequestration.
4628 2018-10-18 16:47:15 US & Saudi Arabia.  Remember that They sell their oil only in US dollars- major factor in the dollar being the worlds reserve currency.  With those profits they buy US Treasuries which finance our deficit and US weapon systems to finance the MIC.
4629 2018-10-18 16:47:03 Oil-weapons-money-oil-weapons-money...……...will anything seriously happen? 
4630 2018-10-18 16:47:02 Once again Pat Roberson shows himself not as a true follower of Christ but as another Snake Oil Salesman. Those still following him, go out & tear down the false idol that is Pat Roberson & others like him. His only god is money, the Republican Party & now, @realDonaldTrump

4642 2018-10-18 16:46:22 Tulsi, Hare Krishna! Can u kindly ask @POTUS what problem does he and/or US have if India bought oil from Iran? Or if India forges ahead with Chabahar port? After all this is going to help US, Afghanistan in having a alternate route bypassing terrorist Pakistan, backed by China.
4643 2018-10-18 16:46:22 What D lines do the Oilers roll with next year assuming all players are healthy and they have them all under contract? —- Nurse, Larsson, Klefbom, Sekera, Russell, Benning, Bouchard, Jones, Bear.  9 possible options, what do you do Oil fans? @OilersNation @jsbmbaggedmilk
4644 2018-10-18 16:46:22 We don't need Middle Eastern oil.
4645 2018-10-18 16:46:03 What a train wreck. We should cut them off completely- buy oil from Canada.
4646 2018-10-18 16:46:02 For those keeping score at home: Wahhabi were behind 911.  Saudi Arabia is the birthplace of the movement.  Wahhabi are Sunni, they have a problem with Shia Muslims.  Iran is Shia.  We like the Saudi oil more than the Iran oil.  I hope ALL politics now makes sense. #TinyTrump
4647 2018-10-18 16:45:56 You think the oil works the same, hubby got some maybe I can take a drop
4648 2018-10-18 16:45:53 We don’t need to re-evaluate, we already know what to do. Get off the damn oil and stop selling them arms.
4649 2018-10-18 16:45:36 I can’t find a CBD oil that affects me like at ALL :(
4650 2018-10-18 16:45:36 @RogerandJP Hey JP can you tell me what kind of CBD oil you use and where to get it? Thanks!
4651 2018-10-18 16:45:32 Interesting that Cross River state has no 'oil economy.' Non-oil sector is now bigger than oil sector in Rivers state while Bayelsa remains largely an oil economy (68.1%). Delta is almost 50-50 with non-oil having an edge. while Akwa Ibom is oil (59.8%). Great job by NBS
4652 2018-10-18 16:45:31 Dear Mr. President. How many dissidents the Turks have executed. How many Arabs, Palestinians, Iranians have the Mossad executed in foreign lands?, or Russians, or Americans have killed?. The Saudis have never told the US, stop the killings or we won't sell you any more oil.
4653 2018-10-18 16:45:31 Wait until you find out about its relevance to #US #arms_deal, Saudi #oil income, #Iran 's #missile program, #Hamas finance and #Turkey 's internal affair and #Israel 's best interests in the whole #universe.
4654 2018-10-18 16:45:29 We will never know.  And at this point I really don't care. 

No one is more chummy with Saudi "Kings" than every oil company and the FEDERAL Government.  I don't care who is/was president, there was something very shady about Saudi Arabia and 9/11.

4657 2018-10-18 16:45:22 Just got this off the web. Haven't researched it. 
"The United States imported 7.9 million barrels of crude oil a day last year, according to the EIA. Mar 20, 2018"
4658 2018-10-18 16:45:12 Agree. By resisting efforts to lead in the development and implement of alternative energy sources/products, we’ve set ourselves up to be unduly influenced, and financially beholden to oil producers (mobs). In too deep now & real, forward thinking countries beat us to the punch
4659 2018-10-18 16:45:08 Steam mango and navy bean. Top off with a touch of sesame oil.
4660 2018-10-18 16:45:06 Clarification: it will bring more revenue that can help Texas families, but it will cut a little bit into oil companies' profits until they begrudgingly raise their prices and pass it back to consumers.

4662 2018-10-18 16:45:04 Quite a dilemma for the US and Saudi Arabia. 

Option A: stand up for morality
Option B: pay $400 a barrel in oil 

We bash Trump, but we underestimate the consequences here.
4663 2018-10-18 16:45:01 I drive a lot for someone who needs an oil change lol
4664 2018-10-18 16:44:59 อร่อย
4665 2018-10-18 16:44:39 So...we should stop trading with #SaudiArabia and let oil prices go through the roof and let the #Russians and #Chinese step in to sell them $Billions in weapons and missiles. GREAT IDEA Bernie, what could go wrong? lol #CrazyBernie #ThankGODSandersLost #WalkAway
4666 2018-10-18 16:44:36 Hold on is this 19.5 the quid pro quo with the sale of Russian oil. Mayflower Hotel 5/27/16?
4667 2018-10-18 16:44:35 Dear Mr. President: Thanks to you, America doesn't need Saudi oil, Saudi $, or 500,000 jobs which might created by the arms deal to them.  You are on the way to making us totally self-sustaining so we don't NEED to be in bed w/these murderers!  Sanction them like you did Russia!
4668 2018-10-18 16:44:27 Looking up a discount coupon for my oil change and my last screen was on porn. Sorry ms.customer service lady 
4669 2018-10-18 16:44:27 Is it just me, or has anyone else noticed that many of the US companies buying alberta oil at a discount (and making huge profits) have the same parent companies as the Canadian companies selling at a discount?

4673 2018-10-18 16:43:52 So far for Iron Dragon 3 I've researched orbital rendezvous, making rocket fuel, designing turbopumps, making vacuum tubes, the Shawnee and Micmac Indian tribes, offshore oil drilling and coal mining. I hope you bastards appreciate this
4674 2018-10-18 16:43:50 $TRTC and $SNNVF together control a significant portion of cannabis oil production. IVXX and CaliGold are two of the most popular brands. Definitely buy-out material
4675 2018-10-18 16:43:47 Of course! But it's something all cars need, even the ones on BHPH lots. Oil changes, tire rotations, coolant flushes, bushing replacements, exhaust work. That all applies. The cost delta between BHPH-used and craigslist-used isn't more than taking out a 23% loan for the former.
4676 2018-10-18 16:43:44 How often is one in desperate need of Japanese mint oil
4677 2018-10-18 16:43:44 We have no body, no tape, and when we get one eventually, it may be of Turks torturing Kurds. Furthermore, Turkey smuggled oil with ISIS, he hates Arabs, now what ok bc t ok believe? 
The guy u coul do be anywhere, dead or alive.
4678 2018-10-18 16:43:23 No, Bilawal, no body walks to their death with so much awareness and nobility. Yes they may be political but they’d also rather be alive.

4682 2018-10-18 16:43:10 Mine needs just cooking oil and salt
4683 2018-10-18 16:43:02 When the oil is gone the U.S. won't bother with the Middle East; bc sending our service members into a fake war to "protect our way of life" is saying we want cheap oil.

Eventually we'll wind up in Africa for the same reasons. Except this time China will already be there.
4684 2018-10-18 16:43:00 A bloody one 2M deaths. Biafra, oil rich region, wanted to secede from Nigeria. There is some colonial history involved too. Some religious regions too. Geopolitics. And lots more I don't know. So hence "random" teams'
4685 2018-10-18 16:42:56 It's not a conspiracy to say that oil companies have enough lobbying power over the government to the point where they have influenced policy which increases dependence on oil. They barely even try to hide it with how shameless the dude that you voted for is.
4686 2018-10-18 16:42:55 .@Mobil1 Oh Boy This Hurts. Cause I Use Your Oil In ALL My Vehicles. But B/c Twitter's Rabid Censorship of Conservative Members, As A Protest I AM BLOCKING ALL Advertising Accounts.

4688 2018-10-18 16:42:38 But you never hear Republicans talking about cutting oil subsidies you never hear the Republicans talk about ending corporate welfare did you know the taxpayers the United States pay corporations to Offshore their jobs cost of doing business why don't we end that
4689 2018-10-18 16:42:18 Sonya Boodoo reports that #Guyana has the 9th largest offshore oil discoveries since 2010 #ASPEnergy
4690 2018-10-18 16:42:11 Precisely. We import only 13% of our oil from the Saudi’s. The murder of a journalist & Trump giving them cover for his our personal profit is yet another VERY IMPORTANT reason to #VoteBLUE!
4691 2018-10-18 16:42:11 Gotta figure out what works for you and what you’re comfortable with. I found places in LA that fry in beef tallow. 

Avocado oil isn’t as great for cooking at high temp even though it has a high smoke point. Doesn’t have the polyphenols olive oil does. Who knows though...

4694 2018-10-18 16:42:01 There will be a replacement for oil since oil is not a sustainable ressource, we are going to run out of it in a couple of decades. And regarding the renewable energy sources; It really is all about economies of scale. It will become cheaper over time.
4695 2018-10-18 16:41:55 lmfao - open for business in high unemployment and unsustainable social program areas(EU) - but closed for business in ready to pump oil and red tape that forced billions upon billions of USD Capital to leave our resources hubs - we are poorer today than 10 years ago
4696 2018-10-18 16:41:55 Tough on LatAm corrupt gov't, Mr President. As for the Saudis let them fight the terrorists, our soldiers deserve better and meaningful wars for freedom, not oil or Nobel Peace prizes. ..you get the drift
4697 2018-10-18 16:41:40 THE UK IS THE BIGGEST PRODUCER OF CANNABIS IN EUROPE........ NOT "CBD OIL", NOT INDUSTRIAL HEMP"......... CANNABIS,, PROPER FULL SPECTRUM CANNABIS
4698 2018-10-18 16:41:35 Or we’ll drill our own damn oil !
4699 2018-10-18 16:41:34 They have vast natural resources. We may not have Scotland’s oil and gas for much longer because they will leave the UK
4700 2018-10-18 16:41:24 15 Saudis flew in for the Istanbul operation. 15 Saudis were involved in 9/11. Are you going to stand by and be an enabler? Some things are more important than money or oil. Let the Saudis band together with the Russians. Along with N. Korea, there’s your new Axis of Evil.
4701 2018-10-18 16:41:22 Your body will make sure that your baby is taken care of. Don’t stress yourself out. Your appetite will get better with time. And use coconut oil for stretch marks, that’ll help a lot! Congrats on your baby!

4703 2018-10-18 16:41:08 I havent bought cooking oil in 2years becoz of the grocery club i dd back then. Am not seeking to buy any cooking any time soon
4704 2018-10-18 16:41:08 Because Buhari did not allow you to steal? or because Buhari determine the price of crude oil? or because you dont understand global economics? Support Atiku  to loot together but dont insult anyone's intelligence that buhari is the reason you are in poverty.
4705 2018-10-18 16:41:05 A3 My go to is a 20-minute linguini with clam sauce. Boil linguini (always al dente). Heat 1/4 cup olive oil & garlic in pan, add a can of drained chopped clams and heat through. Toss with cooked pasta, sprinkle with good Parmesan, chopped parsley & cracked pepper. #AskPastaFits
4706 2018-10-18 16:41:00 it took me YEARS but it’s doable. I find the key for me is moisture retention. As long as I seal my hair with oil after applying the product, it’ll last at least 6 days. If not then I can barely get next day hair.
4707 2018-10-18 16:40:52 Gal do you need a oil change?
4708 2018-10-18 16:40:50 olive oil and salt, put it on the grill
4709 2018-10-18 16:40:17 A4: I like a simple orzo salad tossed with grape tomatoes, chopped basil, feta cheese and olive oil, with a splash of balsamic for good measure. Easy and you just need to eyeball it to your liking. #AskPastaFits

4712 2018-10-18 16:39:47 I believe we buy 13% of our oil from Saudi’s. But what we’re talking about, or should be, is the message we’re sending to the world if trump brushes the grisly murder of a journalist under the rug.
4713 2018-10-18 16:39:46 You think he look good, snack n all that. But insist you need change... IF HE CANT CHANGE YOUR OIL!!! can i get a witness #PreachingAmongstDeafEars
4714 2018-10-18 16:39:45 We know. Plutocrats in government know. But money is their god. Oil companies have defiled scared ground of Native Americans. When ppl protest,government sends what looks like paramilitary. Up to the people to stop it.
4715 2018-10-18 16:39:40 A detailed analysis on the vast range of interlocking US and Saudi interests for 70 years: control of oil supplies, Saudi investments in US, KSA purchases of US arms, lockstep military and FP postures, ends by stating KSA influence in the US is "similar to Russian meddling".
4716 2018-10-18 16:39:33 Still dunking your head in used motor oil each morning I see.
4717 2018-10-18 16:39:32 Are you supposed to fry the yoghurt in the vegetable oil or the margarine? Not a tasty dish at all at all....
4718 2018-10-18 16:39:16 นอนดึกจัง
4719 2018-10-18 16:39:15 ..all sanctions. On the other hand keeping in mind the devaluation of different currencies world wide there would be a possibility to increase in the global oil price. In that case the demand for electric vehicles are to be risen.
4720 2018-10-18 16:39:12 Your country depends entirely on fossil fuels. Without those profits SA would be as poor as Africa. The world is transitioning away from oil. Your time is almost up
4721 2018-10-18 16:39:04 Jamaican blacc castor oil and coconut oil, do hot oil treatments with it
4722 2018-10-18 16:39:03 How much lobby $$$ do you receive from oil companies, ted...

Vote @BetoORourke
4723 2018-10-18 16:38:57 Social security is paid for by its own tax, it doesn’t add to the deficit. So when people talk about “cutting social security to reduce the deficit,” they are talking about stealing from Americans’ retirement to pay debts for wars, oil company subsidies and tax cuts for the rich.
4724 2018-10-18 16:38:55 I used to have broken & fried hair but thank god! Coconut oil is the best I swear

4727 2018-10-18 16:38:30 My car plays sm games w me  likeee do you need an oil change or not
4728 2018-10-18 16:38:19 My grandparents started using CBD hemp oil just recently and we'll I think they are aging backwards now. #healing #hemp #cbd

4731 2018-10-18 16:38:07 I agree Anselmo...but fingies crossed that when all the flow rates are out and this is  stamped as commercial and a monster  we will see a rerate. Plus so much more planned here.
4732 2018-10-18 16:37:58 I forgot I put this oil on today... I can’t smell my coworker, at all.

4735 2018-10-18 16:37:48 Lying Ted has been heavily in news trying 2 bring down Beto-don't forget Abbott is on ballot. Both defend sexual abuse & selling of caged kids, also supported tariff that will raise price of oil & Lying Ted accused Beto of trying to pass but Cruz & Abbott both supported & passed.
4736 2018-10-18 16:37:45 Xabaa suud oil is underrated. That thing is a Gem. It got me through an upcoming flue and ridiculous back pain
4737 2018-10-18 16:37:36 Coconut oil saves lives
4738 2018-10-18 16:37:23 Oil is more lucrative than cheap renewable energy and widespread cheap renewable energy would gut oil sales. These companies all have the resources for restructuring around renewables, the first one wouldn't have a significant advantage.

4740 2018-10-18 16:37:21 Again, if you want to know more about the complicated settlement in ME and elsewhere and how oil played a part in inter-war British policy go read Susan Pedersen’s The Guardians. It’s excellent and will enrich your understanding more than Twitter will.
4741 2018-10-18 16:37:09 anderson cooper, said arwa damon came in contact with damon fox, and is a fake news guy with fake hanicapped!!! his house, listto a private company in new york with fake oil companies postings, basically!!! rockys didn't own the house or jim powell secretly behind ira bloom back!
4742 2018-10-18 16:37:07 Unfortunately it won’t happen.  Electric vehicles are charged from grid with hydrocarbon sources of power.  Need nuclear and then we can sell US gas and oil while charging the cars with a non hydrocarbon source.
4743 2018-10-18 16:37:04 I wonder if that was their statement 'we've got you by the oil barrels'.
4744 2018-10-18 16:37:03 Shin ramyun with an egg and maybe kimchi if you feeling fancy. Congee with any side dish, really. Tofu and soy sauce. Scrambled eggs with tomatoes and some ketchup. My grandma likes to cook lettuce in oil and then add hoisin sauce. 
4745 2018-10-18 16:37:00 Tried to do an at home hack and use coconut oil to moisturize my scalp. I’ve showered twice and my hair is still oily! Fml
4746 2018-10-18 16:36:49 I put this body oil on I thought I like......... well I don't now I hate myself it's all I'm smelling 
4747 2018-10-18 16:36:43 Senate must act if POTUS fails to do so. Our values & principles are greater then any amount of oil or $'s. 19 of 21 hijackers on 9/11 came from Saudi Arabia? No accountability? Past time to call out Saudi's, they seem to get their way with US leadership? What's that all about?
4748 2018-10-18 16:36:34 Tried and true, these 100% pure #CBD oil and essential oil blends are ahead of the curve. See their line of convenient vape pens and fast-acting tinctures for yourself at {INSERT YOUR AFFILIATE LINK HERE}

4750 2018-10-18 16:36:27 A slight drop of 3 and 1 oil to the machine.
4751 2018-10-18 16:36:23 Well it took $75 to fill up the Chevy Silverado yesterday. But that was the plan all along wasn't it. U will cover up murders for the murderers if they r your oil buddies who buy and lease your family properties. #MobPresident #VOTEBLUE
4752 2018-10-18 16:36:21 I hope they are cleaning it up!! I didn't know that our Lovely cruise ships polluting our Oceans! I hope they have since in forced regulations about that with cruise & oil ships??
4753 2018-10-18 16:36:15 I just went into an auto store and I know literally nothing about cars so I told that to the lady that helped me, she laughed in my face and made fun of how little I know. I didn't come here to get bullied Kelly, I just came in to get my oil and go
4754 2018-10-18 16:36:11 Yeah i use As I Am double butter cream or ORS olive oil hair lotion for moisture/shine.. to help the waves form i used 360 Style but I’m at the point now where i don’t necessarily need pomades anymore tbh.. it’s all in the brush work
4755 2018-10-18 16:36:03 A report from the Council of Graduate Schools reaching such a conclusion should be taken about as seriously as a climate-change report funded by oil companies.
4756 2018-10-18 16:35:58 How will #Guyana become the world's largest #oil provider in the western hemisphere? @TheAndyHolland explains... #ASPEnergy
4757 2018-10-18 16:35:52 May be simple simple reason.. oil burn or something like that...
4758 2018-10-18 16:35:48 I’ll tell you who are great communicators. Oil executives come out on top of the pile. Then they disseminate through society, including academia. So ask yourself whether your reluctance to call out oil companies is lack of communication skill, or lack of independence.
4759 2018-10-18 16:35:47 The world would need to disconnect from oil.

4763 2018-10-18 16:35:26 can we name a few for our understanding ? How as a nation we have gained through policies. Please dont mention faultily implemented and previously tinkered schemes ( e.g.GST) His stars are lucky that there is Rahul Gandhi in opposition. With oil at 80 it's a litmus test.
4764 2018-10-18 16:35:23 かわえええええ
4765 2018-10-18 16:35:23 regulated vehicle would be diminished in 2025 until or unless the oil procurement from Saudi Arabia would not be considered sufficient to United States. On the other hand keeping in the mind of different sanctions made by US the oil is not to be considered as the weapon against .

4768 2018-10-18 16:35:07 Well it's about that time of year where I'm gonna be looking extra shiny. I have to drench my whole body in oil just to keep my skin from drying out. Smh I hate this eczema mess 
4769 2018-10-18 16:35:07 Inject with Cajun injector, fry in peanut oil. Most delicious turkey ever, you will not regret 
4770 2018-10-18 16:35:05 On other words we’re going to try to sweep this under the rug because Trump doesn’t want to lose money on his business deals with the Saudi’s and his donors in the oil business would be upset with him. We’d also lose a few billion in arms sales to the people who planned 9/11.
4771 2018-10-18 16:35:02 Qual a probabilidade de oil no 3º poço?
Espero que esse camarada seja o contrário de Eike.
4772 2018-10-18 16:34:53 Anybody ever tried oil pulling ?
4773 2018-10-18 16:34:50 True that 
4774 2018-10-18 16:34:49 That should keep the UK in its place. It’s interesting to see how paralysed nations become, when threatened with countermeasures. Even the largest economy in the world doesn’t want to say anything to offend Saudi Arabia. Oil = money = power = control.
4775 2018-10-18 16:34:35 You want to know where A Former APC Governor of an oil producing state got money to buy House in Kaduna? 
4776 2018-10-18 16:34:33 I feel like when women go get a oil change by themselves they start throwing shit at you that you need this and that, they were trying to say” my battery is at 70% and you tell me that I needed a new battery they wouldn’t return my car back what kind of fucked up place is that?
4777 2018-10-18 16:34:32 i used way too much oil in my hair this morning lol
4778 2018-10-18 16:34:25 Heaven forbid something centuries-old should be revaluated and see if it still applies to modern life. Now excuse me while I get some whale oil to light my lamp so I can finish reading The Yellow Kid.

4780 2018-10-18 16:34:14 ....transport that fuel-grade oil to the plant. THEN consider the costs of global warming and health damage from burning the oil.  And those are ONGOING costs, not just initial ones. Nope.

4782 2018-10-18 16:34:12 LMAO it really is hard to describe but it's what makes a difference in salads and pizza for me, just like olive oil
4783 2018-10-18 16:34:11 The US is in KSAs pocket they own about 10 % of the US markets. They also own a lot of oil they can do what ever they like...  bin laden, 9-11 etc
4784 2018-10-18 16:34:10 The result of this was as much that US, UK, Dutch and French concerns wanted to reduce exploration efforts to avoid over-saturating the market. Ofc none of this was clear in 1914, oil was not a key factor in geopolitics then that it would become even in the late 20s and 30s.
4785 2018-10-18 16:34:08 What I'm saying is, that they aren't gonna kill in a well known establishment, they aren't stupid. But I really have to wonder when we tell them that. Maybe we should get our oil from elsewhere for now. Like democrats I don't think they can be trusted at this time.

4787 2018-10-18 16:33:45 The United States relationship with Saudi Arabia is not just a Trump issue. It has been an issue forever. Our government should not have allied relationship with countries/kingdoms with gross civil laws and potential ties to 9/11. 
BUT OIL.

4789 2018-10-18 16:33:28 Bush let his family leave the country right after 9/11. His family had a lot of oil /business deals with the Bin Laden family. Bin Ladins name was Tim Osmand.. in the CIA. “Allegedly “ RESEARCH
4790 2018-10-18 16:33:26 Batter too thin? Too much oil?
4791 2018-10-18 16:33:21 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, if we have become one of the words top oil producers, why, why, why are we paying so much for gas at the pump? Drowning in California and unable to move yet.
4792 2018-10-18 16:33:13 tRump worships the almighty dollar...even if it has a few oil stains or blood splatters..
4793 2018-10-18 16:33:12 It's kind a joke @MangalaLK of your oil price formula.
4794 2018-10-18 16:33:07 Washington doesn't hold the Saudis accountable for anything they do, including 9/11. There's too much oil and weapons of war that equats $$$$ to concern congress or the White House. When life or money is on the line, we can count on our leaders to choose money (sarcasm).
4795 2018-10-18 16:33:05 My grandfather was telling me how impressed he was with the windshield washer fluid reservoir in his Prius. He said “I have never, I mean NEVER refilled it since I bought this car brand new.” We laughed so hard when I told him they top it off when he gets his oil changed 
4796 2018-10-18 16:32:59 There’s more than just oil though
4797 2018-10-18 16:32:58 Except that Africa has resources the U.S. wants. Lots of oil sitting off the west coast and lots of oil companies want it.

And just like the Middle East, even though it's halfway around the world, the U.S. will stick its nose in, just like we did in Iraq. Was always about oil.
4798 2018-10-18 16:32:46 Well, MECO passing the initial costs on to you is a whole 'nother issue.  Consider the opposite situation: you spend all the money to build an oil-burning power plant. Then consider what it costs to actually remove oil from the ground. And transport it to a refinery. Then....
4799 2018-10-18 16:32:41 Voter were better,
 Informed in the 1800s than they are now because reading time was scarce and information (and lamp oil) was expensive. People were much more careful with what they read and much more discerning.

And on the other hand the electric vehicles are cost effective in nature. The present scenario of the demand of oil ..

4806 2018-10-18 16:31:56 Sesame oil is pretty strong. I use a small splash mixed into the sunflower oil when I'm stir frying.

4812 2018-10-18 16:31:29 This has everything to do with the very real possibility of the Saudis increasing the price of oil as retaliation. Sure Americans are saying punish the Saudis now but I doubt they would have that same opinion after they feel it hit their wallets.

4824 2018-10-18 16:30:53 No, people had long held suspicions particularly around Mosul which was why it’s importance increased by 1918. But remember the world’s relationship to oil was different in 1914, as a commodity it grew in importance between 14-18, by 1920s there was oversupply.
4825 2018-10-18 16:30:37 Haha okay here's the cheat sheet. Stay hydrated and also limit blue light 1 hour before bed. If you're an essential oil user dab some lavender or ylang ylang on your neck and wrists. 3 hours later when it's a success thank me lol

4833 2018-10-18 16:30:07 Did Qatar have large supplies of oil?  Might that have helped?
4834 2018-10-18 16:30:00 You should pay attention more. Yes reserves, that we aren't using. We buy other people's. And then when they have no more-we still do. That's the point. Or if some major shift in world politics happens, we still have oil. I'm saying we shouldn't search for new energy, but were ok
4835 2018-10-18 16:29:59 What does @ABC & their filthy Democrats that own  ABC suggest? That we turn an entire country into an enemy & have $200 oil?  Dems always wanted $10 a gallon gas.  Looks like they are trying to get it.

4837 2018-10-18 16:29:49 The truth is a handful of big oil companies in Ireland are mainly responsible for emissions, but it is so much easier to fleece Paddy who can't afford legal costs to fight phoney carbon taxes.
4838 2018-10-18 16:29:48 Guess I proved the peanut butter instead of cooking oil theory right coz I barely added oil 
4839 2018-10-18 16:29:48 The sooner we distance ourselves from SA, the better.
Our reliance on foriegn oil seems to be coming to close with domestic on the rise.

The Middle East is a sink hole of American lives and money.
SA isn't interested in decreasing that.
4840 2018-10-18 16:29:45 "Biting the hand that feeds me?" Wow that's not an absurdist & baseless ego defense at all. You don't know me personally & your field of expertise has never helped me,  in fact no empirical evidence that it has ever helped anyone. Sounds like snake oil to me.
4841 2018-10-18 16:29:37 Agreed. I’m a big fan of cheddar but it separates into oil and a thin orange taste-free second skin on the burger. American cheese keeps its identity. Cheddar cheese _sauce_, though... #worthexploring

They call it ogaden region even though I’m not happy with that name.. google it what chinase call the gas and oil. They call it ogaden basin.

4848 2018-10-18 16:29:02 The only reason Trump wants “zero oil sales” sanctions is so that Iran rushes to the negotiating table. He overlooked the fact that Iran has customer like China, India, Turkey and EU who will want to continue buying. All are siding with UN, not Trump. That’s a fact.

4858 2018-10-18 16:28:31 The huge funding supposedly provided by Big Oil to combat the agw narrative has clearly not found its way to NZ. The position of ALL industry types I heard is: "yes, yes we know the world is going to end in 10 years time, but we still need to plan energy for the next 30"

4873 2018-10-18 16:27:38 but we still want that Saudi oil.
4874 2018-10-18 16:27:30 Would it be considered that the the electric vehicles are a perfect substitute of the oil regulated vehicles. I think it is not. But despite this fact we should look after the  demand of oil and by the excess demand of the oil in future the price of oil would have been sky..

4891 2018-10-18 16:26:15 @CanadianPM Hey Michael, Curious on your stance of importing oil from Saudi Arabia considering the the recent developments in Turkey. Its inconceivable that we continue to support a government that cleary does not align there values with ours.

4895 2018-10-18 16:26:08 Us off of the oil we rely on from Foreign powers .
I don't think we will not get  off Fossil Fuels completely for a very long time . We can reduce our need .
There are a lot of new technologies that will eventually bring electric engines on the same level with the engines

4897 2018-10-18 16:26:04 Like having water privatized to Suez water and Gulftainer in a strategic port in the mid Atlantic.... And this is in real time.

4899 2018-10-18 16:25:56 To tell you the truth, I'm not sure what is in her mind on this.  I think it more about the oil industry that she has worked in for several years. And those being the people she spends time with.  Not seeing the big picture. She divorced a man very much like trump in temperament.
4900 2018-10-18 16:25:53 @narendramodi Sir, Request you to focus on electric cars. Promote them by provide bonus like no RTO tax, less or no road tax, less or no sales tax. This will help reduce the burden in increasing crude oil expenditure. And this will increase the culture of use of electric car
4901 2018-10-18 16:25:42  ไม่สมควรจริงๆ
4902 2018-10-18 16:25:41 I didn’t say that. But let’s be friendly.  How’s life on the farm?  U know the GOP/Putin troll farm?  Better get paid ASAP. Putin is running out of $$. US oil production has surpassed Russia & Saudi. Avg Russian earns less $ than avg Chinese or Romanian. #Magnitsky Act is working

4917 2018-10-18 16:24:28 I agree, that for many things rising productivity raises its value because it can be used for other (valuable) things. But if car engines became half as efficient tomorrow I'm pretty sure the price of oil would not go down.

4920 2018-10-18 16:24:22 Sir I want our father the heroe of time to share the of those criminal ganging up against our country their oil well license to the state to empower and increase their IGI
4921 2018-10-18 16:24:20 パリは治安悪いから気をつけてねオッパ
4922 2018-10-18 16:24:17 @Cooper4SAE Hey Michael, Curious on your stance of importing oil from Saudi Arabia considering the the recent developments in Turkey. Its inconceivable that we continue to support a government and country that cleary does not align there values with ours.
4923 2018-10-18 16:24:15 No, we need to take *their* oil, the source of their wealth and influence.
4924 2018-10-18 16:24:14 Jajaja. A mí me pasa al revés. Es como con el Barcelona, me gusta cómo juegan, pero sus fans neo-catalanes me parten los .
4925 2018-10-18 16:24:10 Oil level gauge?
4926 2018-10-18 16:24:06 Wow Toyota told me they’d wash my car after my oil change 
4927 2018-10-18 16:24:03 ของคนนั้นเราไม่รู้.. แต่ของเราตอนนี้..ไม่มีแล้วค่ะ 
4928 2018-10-18 16:24:02 tripping on an oil spill and accidentally ending up causing a nuclear meltdown
4929 2018-10-18 16:24:02 would be hard to see how any "extremists" would be worse

reality is that the Sauds "can't" be removed because of the shock to oil prices
4930 2018-10-18 16:23:52 طبعا موجود بتستخدمي اي اصدار

4931 2018-10-18 16:23:48 Love 2018 when you spend money on super rad oil cartridges and then they’re broken so you can’t get high OR a replacement  it’s so sick the future of THC is sooooooo cooooool
4932 2018-10-18 16:23:47 OKAY that makes sense the recipe im seeing was using a more Authetic baconoid beef which probably needed the oil
4933 2018-10-18 16:23:46 Gotta get my oil change

4948 2018-10-18 16:22:02 Kahasol diay magpachange oil noh? 
4949 2018-10-18 16:21:56 I’m waiting for the car to get an oil change and Belen keeps moving a lot and I wonder if the people around can see her and are like wtf lmao
4950 2018-10-18 16:21:54 Why? they just use the oil that is not burned in electric cars to create the electricity at the power plant.....its all a wash.
4951 2018-10-18 16:21:47 How does massively increasing US oil production make the world more dependent on Saudi's ?  If Europe doesn't frack - the other choice is energy imports  from Russia or ME.
4952 2018-10-18 16:21:46 ดูเมนชั่นละแบบ..เฮ้อออออ
4953 2018-10-18 16:21:46 Bids are still coming in for Annie's Attic diecast and Drydene oil drum!  Less than 12 hours left - bids close at midnight.  Thanks to everyone who has sent in a bid - you have been very generous.
4954 2018-10-18 16:21:41 Excuse me, but this reporter is not an American citizen. The deep state wants to implode oil prices. This is a false flag. You want America to get burned from something we don't even have all the truths from? Aren't you curious how the media knew all these details? So soon?
4955 2018-10-18 16:21:34 Khashoggi = writer NO ONE had ever heard of until his murder!!!  Now News Media/Democrats (they're one-in-the-same) want an Oil War to torpedo the U.S. Economy.
4956 2018-10-18 16:21:34 あやふやな逸話ばかりの刑部姫だからって好き勝手しやがって感がとても心地好いですね。ふふふ
4957 2018-10-18 16:21:23 My girl got me obsessed with apple cider vinegar and olive oil mixed and I can’t stop putting it on every veggie I eat...
4958 2018-10-18 16:21:17 not really, oil is fine until 2019 and the next recession
4959 2018-10-18 16:21:05 Wait, there's cannibis oil for you genitals?
4960 2018-10-18 16:21:00 Yep lets throw sanctions on the Saudis and watch them raise oil prices. Then all the anti Trumpers will complain about their gas prices going up.
4961 2018-10-18 16:20:45 He's an oil man, remember.
4962 2018-10-18 16:20:40 This can’t be correct, this website is telling me $200 for a oil change 
4963 2018-10-18 16:20:39 The Middle East countries hate us.2 them we are the Infedels & wish us dead.We have lost to many Amer. lives over there for OIL.We need to become self sufficient & say goodbye to them and let them fight it out for themselves forever & ever. @OutnumberedFNC
4964 2018-10-18 16:20:31 What are all of those things made from? (Hint: Oil) and research Lithium if you think electricity is good for the enviro. People can vote however they want and the majority decides, that is the beauty of Democracy and why Mr. Kenney will be the Premier of Alberta in 6 months.
4965 2018-10-18 16:20:25 looks like the only thing Saudi Arabia can do now, to try to improve its suddenly awful reputation is to deliver the world sub $50 or even sub $40 oil...

#oil #SaudiArabia
4966 2018-10-18 16:20:25 Oil comes back to earth. That was a nice swing trade.
4967 2018-10-18 16:20:22 Oil makes this delicate.
4968 2018-10-18 16:20:09 Kids love to use their hands to mix olive oil & #vegetables before you #roast them in the oven. They are sure to try a least one bite if they had their hands in making it.  #cookingwithkids #healthykids #pickyeaters #parentingtips #parenting #kidchefs
4969 2018-10-18 16:20:01 its only because of money and oil. which the saudis use to buy influence in western nations. they build mosques with imams they select themself and they also buy newsoutlets and opinions. its very dangerous to the west to give money to them and to ally with them.
4970 2018-10-18 16:20:01 Be careful deep frying a turkey. If it falls over on your deck, and the hot oil spreads out (and it will surely catch on fire), you'll have a memorable Thanksgiving for the wrong reasons.
4971 2018-10-18 16:20:00 well ima have bookoo time before my workout so ima go get an oil change
4972 2018-10-18 16:20:00 niko says "dont put any oil down the bacon has enough fat" and that should help it not splash either. also she says if youre afraid you can bake it on a baking sheet instead you dont gotta fry it
4973 2018-10-18 16:19:46 more food for thought: 
Adnan's wife (Shahpari Azam Zanganeh ) is the niece of the current Iran Oil minister ( Bijan Zanganeh)
4974 2018-10-18 16:19:42 Who is using CBD oil and what has it done for you?
4975 2018-10-18 16:19:41 Oil companies have gobs more power than you think and they have developed much better green technology that they aren't releasing or taking out of the experimental phase because it would cut into profits
4976 2018-10-18 16:19:33 They just said $110 for an oil change ... I hate slavery
4977 2018-10-18 16:19:28 Ah, não. Vitimismo não. Cade aquela sua macheza !? Você é um fraude. E você sabe disso !!
4978 2018-10-18 16:19:17 Yeah all those suck. Laura mercier (the oil free one) has been the best for me for yeears. Estée Lauder is good too but expensive. All store brands suck
4979 2018-10-18 16:19:12 Once a pore becomes clogged, it traps skin oil inside. Bacteria grows in this oil and can cause an inflammatory response in the skin.
4980 2018-10-18 16:19:00 oh!イル
4981 2018-10-18 16:18:58 And we'll likely still continue to sell them weapons and buy their oil.
4982 2018-10-18 16:18:58 Another feeble attempt to bamboozle the ignorant to help out the oil companies with their pollutants.
4983 2018-10-18 16:18:47 Just when you think @realDonaldTrump and his admin can't get any more craven, damn if they prove they have no limits to what they will do for MONEY!  @SecPompeo , you are a coward and have again sold out your country for oil and money. Trump won't be satisfied until he's Tsar.
4984 2018-10-18 16:18:45 It’s a way of smoking concentrated cannabis oil. That I’ve never ever tried.
4985 2018-10-18 16:18:43 at current levels if we just produced our own gas in each major center across Canada & sold oil at world market value we would be making an extra $200 million daily in profit... if we doubled production, increased refinery's capacity we could pay out our national debit in10 years
4986 2018-10-18 16:18:34 Science is not democratic, so it is not suited to deciding whether oil companies are good or bad. Academic administration is political, and has too much influence over curriculum. Scientists are too specialized. Has any climate scientist made the leap to human system dynamics?
4987 2018-10-18 16:18:32 Here getting my oil change and there's @DutchBros to one side and a liquor store on the other! 

Alcohol in my coffee FTW #9am
4988 2018-10-18 16:18:29 Correct sir, personal limits in OR are as follows:
One ounce of usable marijuana in a public place;
Eight ounces of usable marijuana
16 ounces of a cannabinoid product in solid form;
72 ounces of a cannabinoid product in liquid form;
Five grams of oil
Four plants 
10 seeds
4989 2018-10-18 16:18:26 Erm... Yes it is.... Gulf war springs to mind. No proof... War based on Lies...for oil... Again.
4990 2018-10-18 16:18:24 If I have a some good pasta on hand , I just cook it, toss in some olive oil and a bit of grated parmesan.. simple but delicious!

4991 2018-10-18 16:18:23 Jamaican black castor oil really be doing wonders on ya beard.
4992 2018-10-18 16:18:20 ก็ยังคงไม่มีเรา
4993 2018-10-18 16:18:16 For the washing, do you use any beard shampoo or face soap or other product? And what type of oil?
4994 2018-10-18 16:18:15 I don't think anybody actually believes a deep fat fryer is a healthy way of cooking anything, no matter what oil or fat is used, do they?  
You won't find me making a strong defence of any processed oil or fat - I use hardly any & prefer my foods whole (plant based, of course!)
4995 2018-10-18 16:18:12 why don't you want unlimited money from your nation's oil reserves to go to you too!?
4996 2018-10-18 16:18:00 It will be interesting to see if the US 180 on KSA is for their oil or if arms sales are enough.
4997 2018-10-18 16:17:57 I’m in the student lab and this chick goes “noo ma’am I’m not gonna use coconut oil for my skin. Im gonna use this thing called genes. And I get it from my mom, she’s black. And black don’t crack.” YALL 
4998 2018-10-18 16:17:55 Me and my partner both watch and both think if this lot are the engine of British business and industry I think we are going to need a lot more oil
4999 2018-10-18 16:17:51 His oil is more important as the prices are rising steadily.
5000 2018-10-18 16:17:36 What a stupid theory. More like he is putting oil prices, arms sales and geopolitics with respect to Iran first. That may be wrong but this personal gain nonsense is moronic
5001 2018-10-18 16:17:32 Bio oil, tea tree oil & shea butter
5002 2018-10-18 16:17:32 SIRMAC Masvingo, charging 8.99 per 2litres cooking oil, its like a black market price. As for PNP Masvingo the best by far price wise.
5003 2018-10-18 16:17:30 I put a ton of coconut oil in my hair to prep it for bleaching later and then realized I have a dentist appointment in an hour so I guess I'm going to my dentist appointment looking like I haven't showered in three weeks

5005 2018-10-18 16:17:25 "Found any oil/gold yet?" If I had, would I be standing in a wet cold field in Wales?!
5006 2018-10-18 16:17:24 Trump was always dirty, oily, snake oil salesman who is now trying to cover up gruesome murder for a fistful of blood soaked money. Fox News is helping him.
5007 2018-10-18 16:17:22 We need some geologists out there! While rovers are great, they're only tickling the surface at present. That and geologists are cheep, now the oil industry is in decline.
5008 2018-10-18 16:17:20 If his hair and unctuous mannerisms are any indicator, he's already got more than enough oil for the deep fryer.
5009 2018-10-18 16:17:20 I'm afraid people underestimate his supporters. I know I was guilty of this before he got elected. I voted third party because I didn't think there was any way he could elected. Snake oil salesmen are scary people.
5010 2018-10-18 16:17:13 คนนั้น ฮืออออ  คือบั่บ
5011 2018-10-18 16:17:13 "There is a lot going on in oil markets these days. The Saudis are threatening anyone who dares to question their abuse of human rights with a curtailment of oil production." Pay attention people.
5012 2018-10-18 16:17:10 ‘They dismembered a journalist on diplomatic/sovereign land’
...

‘But... but, the oil!’


5013 2018-10-18 16:17:05 This speech if it has any meaning, is to show the western leaders that Russia will not hesitate to use NW in any case. They lost any levers on the outer world. Oil terrorism is not working any more. The only thing left for Moskovia is to threat the World with nuke.
5014 2018-10-18 16:17:03 It’s bloody frustrating when these so called ‘journalists’ just don’t see the potential of this huge oil field! It’s fine though because we’ll all have the last laugh

5016 2018-10-18 16:16:59 Keep dreaming. If you force a regime change, the wahabbists will takeover and certainly make 9/11 look like a video game. If you’re too tough on the regime, they’ll impose oil embargo and cut off petrol dollars to U.S. banks. The U.S. empire has made its bed and must lie on it..
5017 2018-10-18 16:16:58 IF THE tweet is liberal offensive it stays on Twitter! BIAS is not going to stop till BIG Government steps in an breaks the bias! Like the big Monopolies of the past, Railroads, Oil, Phone we’re busted! Big tect need to kneel to the American Constitution
5018 2018-10-18 16:16:56 Wake Up Call..Big big Wake up Call. The USA and the World needs to get off the Oil. The Saudis think they have everyone by the "Balls" and that the World needs them  
Untill something Shifts with that Mind set on Oil, it "They " won't stop with their Extortion against the USA
5019 2018-10-18 16:16:51 It’s never been your territory silly guy! We may hand it back once we deplete all the natural resources such as oil, gas etc. That’s only if you play nice..
5020 2018-10-18 16:16:50 Yeah the shedding is a pain in the ass, but it’s part of the process. Try only applying at night. Use a peeling get exfoliant with it (Peter Thomas Roth, Boscia or EWC) & a light moisturizer. The oil isn’t going to do enough hydrating to combat the peeling. Also, wear SPF
5021 2018-10-18 16:16:46 Feel nako favorite restaurant jud nako ang mandarin. Pls tagai ko ninyog stuffed shrimps ug beef brisket na fried rice. Ug ug duha ka platito ba na bsta chili oil

Thank you!
5026 2018-10-18 16:16:28 @OutnumberedFNC yes oil is important not for us but our allies if it goes up for them it will effect the US. Gas will double or triple due world supply demand if we interfere in a Kingdom matter.
5027 2018-10-18 16:16:27 Four new tires and an oil change. My car just don’t know what hit him.

5039 2018-10-18 16:15:06 Any good sedating strain will put me to sleep for a couple of hours. To sleep more than that, I have to use an indica oil.

As a plus, I still have extra THC in my system when I wake up, so I can take a shower and do chores before my morning medicine.
5040 2018-10-18 16:15:02 He wants low oil prices because it's good for the party in power. Democrats want high oil prices because it's bad for the party in power. No one cares about some Saudi citizen.

5044 2018-10-18 16:14:47 okay stop pakai pape product, kita try argan oil je utk whole body haha
5045 2018-10-18 16:14:47 how can we be able to extract metals from their ores if we can't extract cooking oil from sunflowers and soya beans. Zimbabwe so

5047 2018-10-18 16:14:34 Agreed to give Pak oil on deferred payments
5048 2018-10-18 16:14:26 I choose @tedcruz for @TXSen because facts are stubborn things for @betoorourke. In the #TexasDebate, Beto claimed he didn’t vote in favor of a $10-a-barrel tax on oil, but the record shows he did… #ChooseCruz
5049 2018-10-18 16:14:23 got blessed with a free oil change & tire rotation 
5050 2018-10-18 16:14:10 Ну... Подумаешь, разница в положении звёзд всего-то 2к с чем-то лет... Ну, совсем немножко всё съехало... Чуть-чуточку. Так что всё ещё может наладиться...

5052 2018-10-18 16:13:59 It's really hard to hide new coal-fired electric power plants to refine all that invisible oil.
5053 2018-10-18 16:13:51 no it obviously isnt just that, im just saying its more so of the interests that we have that bring us into conflicts, such as oil and the iraq war
5054 2018-10-18 16:13:39 LOL @ profile picture!!
5055 2018-10-18 16:13:34 He is not presidential when compared to past presidents BUT times are different. And I’d rather him then past snake oil salesmen presidents we’ve had. And you cannot argue with the results.
5056 2018-10-18 16:13:19 @2faceidibia does your hair smell like hot oil
5057 2018-10-18 16:13:11 Iran oil embargo, Saudi proxy countering them, Qatar, & the Yemen Houthis misbehavior; coupled with the complexities of geopolitical alliances have to take priority over something we and the world would never condone otherwise. All hands are dirty irrespective of Khashoggi.
5058 2018-10-18 16:13:03 I know that motor leaks oil from every place you can think of 
5059 2018-10-18 16:13:02 The free oil and rotations ended me

5064 2018-10-18 16:12:40 Daniel, that’s false. Chavez brought widespread social benefits to his people and was about to establish a universal health care system using oil profits to fund it. Resentful billionaire oilmen forced a work stoppage that crashed the economy. Capitalist greed starved Venezuela.
5065 2018-10-18 16:12:33 No it does not. But it does an amazing job of making oil and butter.
5066 2018-10-18 16:12:31 A tax break for the top 1% and corporations is not good for TX!  The difference here is the $10 oil tax didn’t pass but your tax break for the rich did.  You suck!
5067 2018-10-18 16:12:26 Keep a close eye on our twitter feed. We are going to be launching a new product within the next few hours, which has been designed for use in storage tank/railcar cleaning. @foxpetroleum @tfg_oil @TankStorageInfo @TanksTerminals @tankandvessel @TStorageAwards
5068 2018-10-18 16:12:19 Also true that Trump has been speaking fluent Arabic since 2016: "Low oil prices, yes to domestic US fracking, production and consumption, decreasing demand for oil as global economy surges, empowering the American consumer to upgrade to newer, more fuel-efficient models."
5069 2018-10-18 16:12:15 Dear Canada, here is what you will find now that weed is legal. Your car insurance will go up because of impaired drivers, your homeowners insurance will go up because of hash oil fires. The smell of weed will be everywhere you go. Crime will rise. Love from Colorado. #Truth
5070 2018-10-18 16:12:04 Bruh the oil show is so empty today lol

5072 2018-10-18 16:11:50 Have you tried Copaiba essential oil? I hear it helps with pain management. Work similar to CBD oil. Check it out if you haven’t already! 
5073 2018-10-18 16:11:42 Guns & Oil & Big Pharma
the GOP Mafia
5074 2018-10-18 16:11:42 Sanction the shit out of them. We still remember there involvement in 911. If they lower oil prices immediately, we might let it go. Would have to be under 2.00 a gallon to start.
5075 2018-10-18 16:11:35 JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE A PERVERT DOESN'T MEAN WE ALL ARE, OKAY? YOU AND UR 12 YEAR OLD SELF CAN DO AS U PLEASE BUT LEAVE EVERY BODY ELSE OUT OF IT... GET UR OWN BABY OIL... U CROSSED A LINE @BTSSBEDS
5076 2018-10-18 16:11:25 Every administration, Dem or Rep, has turned a blind eye to the Saudis participation in terrorism worldwide, for one reason: oil. The only reason we get involved in anything in the Middle East is oil. If we focused more on renewable energy, we can tell the Saudis to 
5077 2018-10-18 16:11:21 "They all look like they need to check their oil."
5078 2018-10-18 16:11:17 Oil volume was ~60 ml, final mixture temperature - 160C.
5079 2018-10-18 16:11:14 WWE should still hold shows not for political reasons but for the fans that can’t travel to America and buy a ticket (not every Saudi is a rich owner of oil fields)
5080 2018-10-18 16:11:09 Ok Olive Oil... turn sideways and disappear like Kate Moss on family guy
5081 2018-10-18 16:11:03 I like that they exist....I think they just need a more credible plan to return to profits...a rising oil price is certainly going to make those thirsty planes of theirs even more of a liability going forward
5082 2018-10-18 16:11:02 @Scottymechanic Also, how to distinguish "happy tranny" from "sad" from hydraulic oil color, smell, texture, content, driving performance, etc? Also "how to keep tranny happy" Also, how long should auto tranny last? (ie. Manual clutch has finite life. Same for auto?)
5083 2018-10-18 16:11:00 Worked in the patch for a US producer, they were paid Brent price, same field sold to a Canadian producer, same oil had to be sold at WCI. This type of system been around for a long time.
5084 2018-10-18 16:11:00 No. The rediscovered Steve Carell painting (oil on canvas, 2018[?]) is kept in my coat closet but is still for sale at $50.00 USD.
5085 2018-10-18 16:10:56 @Samir_Madani Hi! Jim Cramer on CNBC says the Saudis are behind the fall of oil prices because they want apeace Trump after the Kashoggi case and Trum who called for lower prices! What do you think?
5086 2018-10-18 16:10:44 USA needs balance against Iran, but not Saudi OIL anymore thanks to Trump.
5087 2018-10-18 16:10:42 It's all about where consensus is v. where reality comes in.  Consensus in April was this contract would be a big, fat zero.  Reality is that it is something much more than a big fat zero.  Nice thing about oil is it is hard to hide what's happening, unlike gold.
5088 2018-10-18 16:10:36 Getting an oil change and you need all this extra stuff done
5089 2018-10-18 16:10:30 What a silly remark. Its burning fossil fuels that is the major problem. CO₂ and methane in the atmosphere are the most pressing problem. Only a relatively tiny amount of oil is used for lubrication, most is burned for fuel. Then there's coal, and natural gas.
5090 2018-10-18 16:10:26 Agreed, use one of the death row inmates, label them as “rogue killers”, hang them and ask MBS for 30 Million USD plus 5 years of free oil.
5091 2018-10-18 16:10:23 ＢＢの変装は本当にすごいぜ！やっぱベテランだけあるよなー！
5092 2018-10-18 16:10:21 So I finally bought CBD oil today, took 1 drop so far, will see how it goes #psoriaticarthritis #chronicillness
5093 2018-10-18 16:10:13 Bull shit even American knows American's were behind 9/11
Due to financial crisis now America is trying to find new target to atack for oil.
5094 2018-10-18 16:10:09 Who's talking about war? Good old 'oil-for-food'. No techs, no Russian oligarchs' children in London
5095 2018-10-18 16:10:04 That's what I've always thought (my mum's 95 year-old neighbour has only ever used soap & water and has the best skin I've ever seen) but I've been recommended retinol for a skin prob & I'm very skeptical. Pesky beauty industry & their ways. I'll definitely give coconut oil a try

5097 2018-10-18 16:10:03 Acne happens when a pore gets clogged with oil and dead skin cells. It can affect people of all ages. But there are treatments that can help. The trick is finding what works best for you. I am here to help you 
5098 2018-10-18 16:10:01 Oh, but Olive Oil is something else. It is transcendent
5099 2018-10-18 16:10:01 MRP = V1+V2+V3+V4, Much awaited Oil pricing formula revealed to the public. Tax for Diesel Rs 25.48, Tax for Petrol Rs 53.68 “People san now start to calculate the oil prices as a hobby before 10th every month if they are good with numbers” says Minister @MangalaLK
5100 2018-10-18 16:09:58 Does hair oil help with frizzies? :)
5101 2018-10-18 16:09:56 Our morals as a nation should not be for sale to the highest bidder or held hostage by oil. Show all we are a moral world leader. If you do not, murder will be in your head.
5102 2018-10-18 16:09:53 กรนแบบนี้ไม่เรียกนิดหน่อยนะ…
5103 2018-10-18 16:09:44 In 1962, the population of the KSA was somewhere around 4.35 million. 2017 estimates are 32.94 million.

With all the $$, they are still nowhere close to being able to feed that population themselves. They need our $$ for food more than we their oil.
5104 2018-10-18 16:09:38 You should consider seeing a Holistic Vet especially a small dog on 3 different heart medication is quite a lot. And using CBD oil is a great idea. All our dogs are using it.
5105 2018-10-18 16:09:30 May we remind you , GW KNEW ABOUT THE SAUDIS CONNECTIONS TO 9-11 & his FIRST OFFICIAL ACT WAS TO GET ALL THE SAUDIS OUT OF U S SAFELY ( as in within hours) BIG OIL & BIG MONEY. All the way around. “ WE THE PEOPLE” are NOT blind & ignorant !
5106 2018-10-18 16:09:28 Moon in Picses this weekend ,rules oil.  Sun moves in Scorpio Monday night - also related to Oil , and middle east tentions.  On Nov 16 , Moon returns to Pisces with Mars forming square to Jupiter, Venus direct on that day. I'm liking a long play on oil in this window
5107 2018-10-18 16:09:26 Who could have thought by 2018 we would be creating WhatsApp groups for finding fuel, cooking oil and bread.. Bantu, bread! Isinkwa?
5108 2018-10-18 16:09:22 K.O.
5109 2018-10-18 16:09:18 Read that most olive oil on store shelves is already rancid. Most people can't tell the difference.
5110 2018-10-18 16:09:18 Go buy more snake oil and tinfoil hats... LMFAO!!
5111 2018-10-18 16:09:14 ？わたし、香港人と結婚すれば良いんじゃ ね？ ちがう？
5112 2018-10-18 16:09:12 Sure Bernie. I assume you will support pipelines and US oil drilling then right? Just making sure you have a viable plan and aren’t just grandstanding.
5113 2018-10-18 16:09:12 I’ll pay you to do my oil change if you want
5114 2018-10-18 16:09:09 you have to believe it as the Saudi oil and business is vital to the USA. is not about human rights any more these days is gone
5115 2018-10-18 16:08:58 Never I just use vegetable oil, seems to work fine
5116 2018-10-18 16:08:57 Texas Tea will be the topic when the @CNBCFuturesNow team joins the @HalftimeReport at 1250pm ---Is the slide for oil over and if not how much more to downside? --Iranian oil --US production --sanctions --we cover it all #oott #crudeoil
5117 2018-10-18 16:08:56 First the earth cooled. And then the dinosaurs came, but they got too big and fat, so they all died and they turned into oil. And then the Arabs came and they bought Mercedes Benzes.  #ExplainHowYouGotHere
5118 2018-10-18 16:08:52 Не разрушай, пожалуйста, моё мировосприятие.
5119 2018-10-18 16:08:52 AB is more than oil fields. Marine commerce out of the #YVR port will grow regardless of #TMX. Where I live, the port facilities are a major employer -what we do as a Hub City. This marine traffic will continue with or w/o #ProRep.
5120 2018-10-18 16:08:50 Ok, so you got a person who can anoint their head with Vaseline who can "throw da hands" with/for you.

But who you got that can anoint your head with oil to pray with/for you? 

Food for thought

5125 2018-10-18 16:08:19 They're at the dealership like "sir, you've gone through 35 gallons of synthetic oil this month alone. You're bankrupting us"
5126 2018-10-18 16:08:12 Olive oil that we use to cook with can I use it on my hair to mix with the other oils?

5127 2018-10-18 16:08:10 @HondaCustSvc (or lack thereof) so called "ExpressChange" oil change, w/appointment is 90 min at @BillPageHonda & @tysonshonda warns you to expect to wait at least 2 hrs. Local Gas station was less than 30 minutes. Local garages also do better on maintenance & repairs.
5128 2018-10-18 16:08:06 agreed. the worse use of oil,gas and coal is to burn them!
5129 2018-10-18 16:08:01 Your pay masters are worried about U.S. domestic policy, otherwise you wouldn't be posting here and now.  Especially now that we're less dependent on your oil and the future is in renewable energy. You need us for your defense more than we need you for oil.
5130 2018-10-18 16:07:57 Я лев, а сама по себе хрен знает кто. Зодиаком меня не описать, как не старайся — взаимосвязи нет.
Ах да, а ещё я увлекаюсь астрономией(немного), и открою тебе секрет — ты не телец. Это созвездие уже давным-давно съехало с той даты по которой её принято считать за тельца.
5131 2018-10-18 16:07:56 How often do you use flax seed oil on your cast iron?
5132 2018-10-18 16:07:55 I'd have a standing  appointment every day at 9am to get my tires rotated and oil changed since the dealership tryna be funny
5133 2018-10-18 16:07:51 Price of a barrel of oil keeps falling! But in California the price  of a gallon of gas keeps going up! Remember this when you vote! Two some newsom and liberal socialists are out to destroy the middle class! Yes on 6! Yes on Cox! 
5134 2018-10-18 16:07:47 We love  Palestine but they heated us more since the oil had been discovered

5138 2018-10-18 16:07:31 Then get some cbd oil lol
5139 2018-10-18 16:07:19 Politics is stupid because they'll pair up voting to ban offshore drilling for oil with banning vaping inside enclosed spaces. Like these are not similar at all.
5140 2018-10-18 16:07:18 Oil....
5141 2018-10-18 16:07:16 I agree you do very good music, but good music without being exposed what ever method is like oil under the soil needed to be exploited to be worthy.

5144 2018-10-18 16:07:08 @Scottymechanic (2/2) ... Vids on (a) do auto-transaxle  coolers help/hurt/neither,  (b) ATF drain/refill vs. mechanic's machine "flush:" (ie. Do the ATF flush machines really capture ALL the oil,   including the torque converter?) (My '99 Sonata likes both, AFAICT)
5145 2018-10-18 16:07:03 PROTECTIVE ESSENTIAL OIL BLEND FOR COLD AND FLU
Cinnamon,Cloves, Orange/Lemon, Eucalyptus, Rosemary
5146 2018-10-18 16:07:02 People are also being told that Florida is going to be underwater in 2025 (CBS News October 2015) is that any more true?  Of course not.  Both sides have bad actors.  Alarmists, deniers, money grubbers and snake oil salesmen. See the whole board not just your side.
5147 2018-10-18 16:07:01 Anybody supplemented with CBD oil for no particular reason? And have you seen any benefits in any way?
5148 2018-10-18 16:07:01 Unfortunately I seen it and could not convince others. America is still is still wanting to be conned by the snake oil seller. Then again, many still believe someone made all of this in a week.
5149 2018-10-18 16:06:52 Adams Oshiomhole in 1999, as president of the Nigerian Labour Congress and, prominent as the leader of a campaign of industrial action against high oil products prices in Nigeria but today the same man supported a government that increases the price of same products in Nigeria.
5150 2018-10-18 16:06:44 The US have a deal with Saudi Arabia called the petrol dollar. The US have promised they will support the Saudi's politically and provide military support in exchange for any sale of oil in US backed currency. The US can't afford to back out. It's political suicide.
5151 2018-10-18 16:06:39 I need that facial oil in my life 
5152 2018-10-18 16:06:28 Kalamazoo, MI. Horrifying smell, covers whole city. River contaminated with oil, PCBs, PFAS, dioxins. Water contaminated with PFAS and dioxins(local township water shutdown). Mayor, gay, young men on both shoulders, keeps it quiet. Dumped homeless belongings, arrested them.
5153 2018-10-18 16:06:27 KINAIN KO NA OIL PASTEL MO HAHAHAHAHHAHAUAHA
5154 2018-10-18 16:06:25 sharv got paid 5 pounds for stitching someone’s pants. this is the same guy who didn’t know we needed oil to fry eggs
5155 2018-10-18 16:06:23 Yes but they have oil
5156 2018-10-18 16:06:21 People can absolutely choose to not use oil. Electrical hearing for example. Electric cars. Etc. And generation of electricity need not be oil or gas based either. People can choose to vote for governments that build non-oil based generation.

5158 2018-10-18 16:06:14 @stevenmnuchin1 You should still go to the conference, with the Saudis. If @BarackObama can be friends with Iran, and give them 400 mil. To help sponsor terrorism. Then why can't we have Saudi as a ali ? Plus we need them to help with oil prices, and arms sales @realDonaldTrump
5159 2018-10-18 16:06:12 Yes, Unfortunately austerity has zero impact on the price of oil in the global market.
5160 2018-10-18 16:06:12 Always keep tea tree oil on deck
5161 2018-10-18 16:06:02 America exports crude oil and LNG.  Who cares what OPEC charges for oil? We do not need a single drop of it.
5162 2018-10-18 16:06:00 I've seen a number of articles asking "is the $500 Dyson Airwrap Worth the Money". I would say if you have a very large amount of disposal income and like hair and beauty products it is worth it. Otherwise it is certainly not #DysonAirwrap

5164 2018-10-18 16:05:48 He didn’t respond for two weeks and then when I reached out to check he huffed and said he’ll do it himself. Lol be my guest!
5165 2018-10-18 16:05:46 3) It's not fair attributing "economical mess" to social model as would have existed another that could has sustained benefits better on oil revenues. The enemy isn't the system that provided benefits for ppl so why it should be destroyed? Maduro fought to keep it, that suffice.

5173 2018-10-18 16:05:04 Can’t disagree w that, but I’d rather not have $200 a barrel oil or have Iran running the Middle East.  So let’s be cautious. @LindseyGrahamSC
5174 2018-10-18 16:05:01 @Scottymechanic Papa said "Temperature matters A LOT to transmissions. Happy trannies  are 'not too hot, not too cold, JUSSST right. Clean, fresh, CORRECT oil,  too." Automatic transaxles (and transmissions) are SOO expensive  to repair or replace. How about segments on... 1/2
5175 2018-10-18 16:04:59 Everyone is a victim except those damn evil white males!  Especially horrid are the ones that work in the oil patch !
5176 2018-10-18 16:04:55 Let’s meet halfway. You drill/frack for oil and natural gas this country needs, stop methane emissions and quit exporting. We’ll use what we need.
Together, we move our focus, engineering and investments to renewable energy. Works for us. You?
5177 2018-10-18 16:04:51 US can't to much. We need them to keep buying stock in our companies, buying our land and our weapons and we need them to sell us oil.
5178 2018-10-18 16:04:43 It helps when you have so much oil
5179 2018-10-18 16:04:43 I told him that chapter should focus instead on glass ceiling, women in informal and precarious labor, wage gap and then maybe a small part

5191 2018-10-18 16:04:01 It's wasn't oil tho. It was the soup.
5192 2018-10-18 16:03:59 not everything focused on one technology. i know that you are new to this : but first to focus on technology that is here and actively in use to get free from oil and especially diesel issues (cities!) in parallel ramp FC for busses, trucks and marine. robust prudent!

5195 2018-10-18 16:03:30 1-3 MBS, the 32-year-old de facto ruler, has overseen the most fundamental transformation in the modern history of the Gulf nation. He has shaken up the ultraconservative oil superpower with economic, social and religious reforms since becoming crown prince.

5198 2018-10-18 16:03:23 I don't think you have to live somewhere to care about it. I feel sorry for the orangutans facing extinction because of palm oil production but I don't live in the jungle.
5199 2018-10-18 16:03:23 Saudi Arabia is the pillar of the global oil markets, and consequently, any developments in Saudi or outside Saudi could affect oil prices
5200 2018-10-18 16:03:21 That’s not how you check your oil level
5201 2018-10-18 16:03:12 thank you!! someone suggested to me recently that hormones in milk might be related to skin problems (with the reasoning that hormones in humans increase oil production) and I thought I remembered hearing that was bullshit buuuut it had been a while. glad I know an expert!
5202 2018-10-18 16:03:10 “So, the baby King definitely had the journalist murdered and dismembered, but we need their oil, and they need our weapons. Any other questions?”
5203 2018-10-18 16:03:08 Actually, it is. Even some oil company people are starting to realize some form of carbon tax would be the least painful way to keep climate change from trashing our economy.
5204 2018-10-18 16:03:03 Hello sharks! I am here to revolutionize how Americans spend 20-25 minutes! I’ve got three words for you: ... oil change barbers!
Thank you, I’m asking for 1% at a $10mill valuation.
5205 2018-10-18 16:03:00 actual people have begun interacting with my bot like the oil meme
5206 2018-10-18 16:02:59 I lord this gift over my 5’6 husband any time he needs to reach the cooking oil
5207 2018-10-18 16:02:58 Must be from oil Dale
5208 2018-10-18 16:02:57 Sure everyone should have there own way..
But it's not only about oil..
We are Saudis using the $ currency as an exchange of oil 
If we gave up on that, U.S $ will means nothing 
So I guess you guys should try to connect $ with gold. it's more than just an oil
5209 2018-10-18 16:02:42 @realDonaldTrump No cap on oil exports=increased oil imports=increased gas prices and food/commodity prices.  Elections!

I have a good feeling about this one...

5217 2018-10-18 16:02:23 Nah, Trump’s compromised, got not balls. We don’t need Saudi oil or their blood money. Hold murderers accountable don’t fellate them, what kind of snowflake encourages that?
5218 2018-10-18 16:02:14 But but but free oil changes!!

5222 2018-10-18 16:01:43 Well done again Sky  Snake oil put on spot,slides neatly away with end point,”no more than I know where you get your money from” investigation Please!
5223 2018-10-18 16:01:39 I read Anita Roddick's autobiography when I was 15 . She said all moisturisers do the same thing. No point investing in an expensive one.  She said we are all conned by beauty industry. Coconut oil is good 
5224 2018-10-18 16:01:33 Donald Trump’s sanctions threat will remain only an empty threat, beyond the fact that he has business ties with the Saudi's , they could easily cap its oil production significantly would inflict heavy casualties on the Republicans ahead of the mid-term elections.
5225 2018-10-18 16:01:33 gotta get my oil changed
5226 2018-10-18 16:01:26 If worse comes to worse - which is sooner than later - the world runs on nuclear power and hydro to electric cars. The world consumes 2 trillion gallons of oil a year. How long can that last? The threat of economic meltdown from running out of fossil fuels is > climate change.
5227 2018-10-18 16:01:22 Prepped my food for when I get off. All I have to do is put the oil in the pan.
5228 2018-10-18 16:01:16 But you see, this photographer hit me wanting to collab.. and that’s coooolllll but in his vision there’s to be tons of oil and skin involved & im fine but I’m not THAT fine lmao. Not yet.
5229 2018-10-18 16:01:08 How is it that the Saudis and the Americans are supposed to be such great allies. We buy their   oil With a knife at our throats..
5230 2018-10-18 16:01:02 I've only tried the dry body oil but I want everything lol

5233 2018-10-18 16:00:56 free oil changes and tire rotations have me cackling. that's like the cheapest part 
5234 2018-10-18 16:00:50 19 of the 9/11 terrorist were Saudis ....All about the oil and $$$.
5235 2018-10-18 16:00:45 I dont give a rats behind how long our "wonderful strategic" relationship is with these vile demonic oil rats..they chopped this guy up and dissolved him in acid....CBN has reported on this via news source's from the sand trap..stop dancing with the devil, God will not be mocked.

5242 2018-10-18 16:00:24 We did some natural teething oil, cold/iced washcloths, & silicone teethers! It helped a little but he was still miserable most of the time

5243 2018-10-18 16:00:22 Supreme Court orders FG to recover 18-year lost revenue from oil giants

The SC on Wednesday ordered the FG to immediately commence steps to recover all revenues lost to oil exploring and exploiting companies due to wrong profit sharing formula.
5244 2018-10-18 16:00:18 Summary: "Let's ship oil through our state for free so companies don't have to pay wages for transportation, including state payroll taxes." Total ripoff!
5245 2018-10-18 16:00:16 SAD,SAD.Saudis could’ve brought their country into 21st century, made it not only oil wealthy,but so much more.
5246 2018-10-18 16:00:14 @realDonaldTrump So did u let SA kill Khas so they'd dump oil/lower price like u wanted? Do u get a cut too, or just the promise of bldg the world's gaudiest tower there? U probably hope to live there when we run u & ur nasty family out for being criminals. How much $ u sell for?
5247 2018-10-18 16:00:07 I'm big into oil. I own lots of it and I know what it smells like. It's rich smelling. The smell itself spawns property and mansions.
5248 2018-10-18 16:00:06 Its not only about oil my dear.
5249 2018-10-18 15:59:56 ขอโอกาสให้ออยบ้าง
5250 2018-10-18 15:59:56 The oil bunkering issue just made me weak! Ah!
And I bet there is more to come!
5251 2018-10-18 15:59:49 BECAUSE they ran out of oil. They're pot of gold is empty
5252 2018-10-18 15:59:46 Here's another way to look at it.  Governments of Canada and Norway are why those are the only 2 oil rich nations in the world where citizens prosper & region not doomed to an eternity as exploited and corrupted petro-kleptocracies.
5253 2018-10-18 15:59:40 Free oil changes and tire rotations? You can get your tires rotated for $17.... Nd you not going no where far bc I’m sure u at work to pay the note so them $40 oil changes won’t happen that often. It don’t add up
5254 2018-10-18 15:59:37 Yo diría que es democracia a medias por el hecho de que si existe el sufragio. Pero no me convence los "cómos". Esperemos que gane la sensatez y se mantenga el proyecto de Texcoco. Saludos!
5255 2018-10-18 15:59:35 Tweet this @realDonaldTrump MBS himself said "if ANYONE is charged with a corruption, they will be harshly dealt with, including Princes". STOP, the Red Scare baiting Leftist, Journalists, Anti-Fascist's, as the Enemies! Is it about G.O.D. (Gold, Oil & Drugs)? #DemandPressFreedom
5256 2018-10-18 15:59:29 I do not agree with the given rate of inflation. It is grossly understating the obtaining reality for most goods and services. All the goods that have not properly adjusted pricing like fuel, cooking oil and bread are in acute short supply.
5257 2018-10-18 15:59:28 dats for groundnut oil.. hv not seen any one 4 red oil
5258 2018-10-18 15:59:16 So, Saudi Arabia has killed almost 3,000 people in the 9/11 attack and now Khashoggi...but you know...oil...

5262 2018-10-18 15:58:56 Meritocracy is a myth and oil companies are holding back renewable energy and need to he nationalized or at least barred from being lobbyists.

5269 2018-10-18 15:58:27 Serious Misleading Advertising!!: 

I have never made mince pies with palm oil in them

Waitrose & Sainsbury's were doing this years ago
5270 2018-10-18 15:58:24 I don't deny prices were $150, however you ignore the fact that we purchase oil at $100 when it was $60 
5271 2018-10-18 15:58:21 fReE oIl ChAnGeS
5272 2018-10-18 15:58:09 As long as the Saudi’s sell oil there’s zero chance of anything changing but my worry is also for the safety of all journalists *First They Came*
5273 2018-10-18 15:58:07 Sees You Dummies ... this exactly why we need to utilize our own oil supply and stop importing what we already have OIL
5274 2018-10-18 15:58:06 あーーーもうすきだわ
5275 2018-10-18 15:58:05 Chavez nationalizing the oil industry is not imperialism
5276 2018-10-18 15:58:02 We have enough oil production to sustain the U.S. We don't need Saudi Arabia. 

Let the middle east destroy themselves.
5277 2018-10-18 15:58:02 I forgot to put coconut oil....on my hair!!!!
5278 2018-10-18 15:58:00 ถ้าออกเที่ยงคืนกูจะนอนละนะ
5279 2018-10-18 15:57:54 We need that oil moneh!!! @ManUtd
5280 2018-10-18 15:57:54 You nailed it. Don't u ask yourself why those who own & control MSM r pushing the CHAOS? They r puppets of a more powerful small group who control banking systems, distribution of oil, food, & arms, & now seek 2 control (limit) the explosion of Inform. Tech, their biggest fear !!
5281 2018-10-18 15:57:53 Yup. And take oil cap off and put your hand over to check compression 

5282 2018-10-18 15:57:52 Sad u dont see your own daftness thru all that plastic and gasoline in your boat rv car. What makes Canada move is oil lumber etc. seriously. Wow.
5283 2018-10-18 15:57:51 I used milk to mix MTR gulab jamun powder, and added 2-3 spoons of ghee to oil while deep frying..other than that I don't know how 
5284 2018-10-18 15:57:42 suppose for 1sec that carbon tax would only apply to heating oil and vehicle fuels, that would make all construction, shipping, logistics, moving services more expensive, despite none of it being voluntary like driving to a national park for a picnic
5285 2018-10-18 15:57:42 I said this a lot last year and I'll say it again. Trump and Saudis are all about the Black Gold. Oil will always make money because we are the ONE'S that pay for it.
5286 2018-10-18 15:57:40 Ok but how do I get inspiration for what to draw/do in oil pastel...
5287 2018-10-18 15:57:40 This coconut oil I bought from Sephora is heaven sent
5288 2018-10-18 15:57:39 Mustard seed oil, makes them hot as f#*k
5289 2018-10-18 15:57:38 Oil.
5290 2018-10-18 15:57:37 We have or want sanctions on a whole mess of oil producers. From Russia, Iran and Venezuela to now the Saudis. We are at limited capacity and prices are going up even now without sanctions. There is no set dollar number but if they stop production all is posisble.
5291 2018-10-18 15:57:33 CLIMATE CHANGE:  (4 of 4):

Fossil fuels would be relegated to a significantly less % of our energy portfolio to accelerate Renewables. Who loses? The oil companies and people - like trump, Saudi Arabia, Russia - who are heavily invested in the fossil fuel based economy.
5292 2018-10-18 15:57:19 Every living, breathing human being should want to eradicate sexual violence, harassment and discrimination from each & every corner of the globe. *I DO.*

@TaranaBurke is a successful "clown" driving 1/2 the country towards healing w/the #MeToo movement. That's no "snake oil".
5293 2018-10-18 15:57:08 Cheap oil... More like sleeping with the devil.
5294 2018-10-18 15:57:08 None, if you keep using that dirty palm oil.

5297 2018-10-18 15:57:00 Trust and Demoncrat goes together like oil and water!
5298 2018-10-18 15:56:59 And Utah. No one talks about how monuments were built to protect Native American lands WITH Native Americans and suddenly the land is taken away for oil, etc
5299 2018-10-18 15:56:59 They weren't disgusted when 15 Saudi citizens flew planes into our buildings and killed thousands of us in 2001. Why should they be disgusted now? It's all about oil and money people. Wake up!
5300 2018-10-18 15:56:55 cbd oil
5301 2018-10-18 15:56:52 ASS-umptions. They are not allies they are enemies we do business with because they control the oil. No I'm pro returning all the military forces we removed from central America -> Afghanistan to return and restore civility like they did before it went crazy with drug cartels.
5302 2018-10-18 15:56:26 Davos in the desert is a pipeline dream. The promised money seen Masayoshi's SoftBank 22B down this week after the Saudis pulled the plug 2wks ago. It's not the 1st time the sell of Aramco stake dropped in August. The Lure of Oil$ will keep more hooked.
5303 2018-10-18 15:56:24 Excelente trabajo como siempre, es ud un Maestro. Deja claro que esta "consulta" es un ejercicio anti-democrático.
5304 2018-10-18 15:56:21 Exactly, but they do have an agenda that they are hiding from Texans & don't want to talk about it. 
Open Borders
Abortion
higher taxes
kill big oil
reduce military
impeach Trump
impeach Kavanaugh
socialized medical.
5305 2018-10-18 15:56:21 For me this is a Yes or no question - 
were world oil prices cheaper than now in 2013/2014 when petrol was 150/-? NO, it was expensive .
To satisfy you on big picture logic, then questions like what other factors resulted in forex increase, budget deficit, etc need answers too 
5306 2018-10-18 15:56:20 Rule of oil, Rule of dollar Rule of Law. #Kashoggi
5307 2018-10-18 15:56:19 The way Trudeau has backpedalled on indigenous rights and electoral reform, and how he is trying to force an oil pipeline down the throat of unwilling British Columbians is shameful.
5308 2018-10-18 15:56:06 Left or Right don’t have to mention a word about Racism to know it’s alive and thriving like a well oil machine. The disparity in wealth is very big indicator without all the talking
5309 2018-10-18 15:55:58 Recipe idea, buy one kebab with salad , receive kebab., add spinach water cress ,ginger ,garlic and kale , a dash or two of virgin olive oil , stir fry to required tastiness
5310 2018-10-18 15:55:57 Fuck OPEC oil. We got that shit figures out now.
5311 2018-10-18 15:55:57 Let's be honest: we would totally be calling out Saudi Arabia on all of its shit if we weren't so dependant on oil (read: renewable energy).
5312 2018-10-18 15:55:50 The politics of oil and power.
5313 2018-10-18 15:55:41 Let put it this way.there have been cures for all major diseases.all have been suppressed over love of money.there have been zero technology energy.non dependence of oil.all have been suppressed. No more living hell.this shall be heaven on Earth or else
5314 2018-10-18 15:55:23 @thekapman @chrisbleck @jordancornette @Jeff_Meller is that a door or cabinet door I hear in the background lol oil that hinge up lol
5315 2018-10-18 15:55:20 @AndrewBellBNN on $CNQ continuing to hit new 52-week lows:
It could be the heavy oil discount although they should profit from cheaper feed stock. The market may fear a weak print at the Nov01 quarterly results.

Other falling energy stocks mentioned are $VET & $WCP.to

5317 2018-10-18 15:55:18 Hi, thanks for reaching out! Our commitment  for the top 10 sourcing is to be sustainably sourced by 2020 on our main ingredient category. This was achieved in 2015 with palm oil category as 100% responsible sourcing. Thanks
5318 2018-10-18 15:55:15 I for one am grateful to know that arms sales and oil will mitigate torture and murder

5320 2018-10-18 15:54:56 Oil production rates are the real basis on which the US-Saudi relationship is based. Oil prices r important to regulating inflation and growth rates.
5321 2018-10-18 15:54:54 You can't just end relationships with Saudi Arabia. That would result in 200 dollars a barrel oil, and Iran and Russia taking over the Middle East. It's a delicate balance here
5322 2018-10-18 15:54:52 Abia also recieves money for producing oil.
5323 2018-10-18 15:54:49 So no fear WTI/OIL bid?
5324 2018-10-18 15:54:44 I am short oil too. It’s a beautiful thing!

5326 2018-10-18 15:54:36 I think this whole thing vanishes since America is so dept on Saudi oil--
5327 2018-10-18 15:54:33 They only supplied 15 of the 19 terrorists on 9/11. They only supply us with oil, they only purchased 40 or 50 million dollars from Trump directly so we need to provide them with more lenience then lets say Canada or Mexico...
5328 2018-10-18 15:54:29 Have you tried steaming your face over a basen and a towel over your head. The hot water usually has Vicks or olbas oil
5329 2018-10-18 15:54:27 The bond and crude oil demand  levels from my previous two trading sessions are working nicely. Hope some of you took them. #PDF
5330 2018-10-18 15:54:26 They left the office for Buhari with 28 dollars a barrel. While during their watch a barrel went up as much as 140 dollars. Now that the price of crude oil is going up again, they want to come and continue from where they stopped. God will surely intervene
5331 2018-10-18 15:54:18 It reminds me of my childhood and my little guitar made with can of oil and fishing line.
5332 2018-10-18 15:54:11 400+. But they already ARE 500+ km away. Putin should be forced to choose between 100 km more and oil-for-food program.
5333 2018-10-18 15:54:03 As you wrote a couple times: “If managed properly...” :) But that planning needed to have been done already. At this rate, Guyana won’t have an OPV (and trained crew or maintenance staff to run it) before oil comes online.
5334 2018-10-18 15:54:01 I took a little too much of my CBD oil last night which gave me really bad sleep paralysis. At one point I felt something clawing at my covers. Talk about CREEPY!

5338 2018-10-18 15:53:40 Just been for my first run, for about 3 weeks. Dodgy back. Crocked knees. These days, I’m like an oil tanker. Take ages to get moving. But once I do, there’s no stopping me.
5339 2018-10-18 15:53:35 He is a man that has lived a very cushy life off the backs of others that are willing to throw money away for a fantasy. Fear makes the snake oil salesman wealthy, that wealth is then used against those most fearful, reinforcing the fear & teaching the next generation - to fear $
5340 2018-10-18 15:53:31 Nahhh it’s so easy but it does take a heck of a lot of time to do in batches of like 5 and heck of a lot of oil

5342 2018-10-18 15:53:24 Stand for truth....these demon infested oil rats are vile and we shouldn't be doing ANY business with them.
5343 2018-10-18 15:53:21 @MarcHochman just listened to the game show about Bams tweets. When you mentioned the tweet about hot 6 oil I was laughing hard. When slappy said yes that bam tweeted that, I was crying. Enjoy your bus ride.  #radiogold

5346 2018-10-18 15:53:03 Trump is going soft & making excuses for Saudi Arabia because of oil & Iran. I hope it blows up big time in his face. What about his "grand" idea of "Putting America First"? Doesn't that apply to "our oil production?"

5356 2018-10-18 15:52:23 I would like it if somebody looked into how much groundwater contamination there is in Saskatchewan. We also received a lot of revenue from oil&gas over the past decade, but @PremierScottMoe won't tell how the SKParty squandered it. #WhereDidTheMoneyGo
5357 2018-10-18 15:52:14 Radar: the Tirumala temple uses this oil to anoint the sacred image of Hindu god Vishnu every Friday. Kings bathed in this oil. Chanel used this oil in its #perfume Chanel No. 5. The source of the oil? the strong-smelling secretion produced by the cat-like civet's perineal glands
5358 2018-10-18 15:52:09 But it reminds of that magnetic band that all these dummies bought cuz some pro basketball player wore it and said it worked. 

I can't afford snake oil.
5359 2018-10-18 15:51:51 Will see how moral you guys will get if oil hits 100 per barrel..
5360 2018-10-18 15:51:47 In other words they have oil and we need to play nice.
5361 2018-10-18 15:51:40 “I got free oil changes and tire rotations” lmaoo honesty the salesmen deserve some kind of award for this
5362 2018-10-18 15:51:36 After all, they already own and operate massive amounts of US hardware, difficult to switch. And we also implicitly guarantee their security from dominance from the Iranian Persian Shiites, who are already quasi client states of the Russians. And oil is traded in US dollars, with

5366 2018-10-18 15:51:22 Yes. The only difference is oil. We could end the relationship quickly by using other sources, putting more money into renewables. We don’t need them. Trump does. Jared does. They are both gullible fools.
5367 2018-10-18 15:51:16 It's interesting that the cartoon is using the correct term of "Oil Industry", rather than trying to hide behind the "energy sector" euphemism.

Rather than trying to hold Canada back, the "energy sector" should focus on #RenewableEnergy sources. Much cheaper & cleaner to "mine"!
5368 2018-10-18 15:51:05 Its traded on the commodities  market not the stock market. Oil in Newfoundland is produced at tidewater and gets the full Brent Crude price depending on when the contract was made. Brent last time I checked was $81.
5369 2018-10-18 15:51:04 Mr President, please look at the article "Study Revealed Numerous Passages in Saudi Textbooks Advocating Intolerance and Violence." Saudi Arabia has been teaching children to have a pro-terrorism mindset for years. Purchasing oil from Saudi Arabia is doing a deal with the devil.

5374 2018-10-18 15:50:52 These indicators have been brewing for a long time. A great example is the 'positive' benefit oil spills have on GDP. Clean-up contracts, money to be made, at the expense of poor people and environment, all made 'good' through the light of the rich's metrics of success
5375 2018-10-18 15:50:48 ECONOMIC INDICATORS: 18 October @ 18:00 
The dollar is trading at R14,32, the euro at R16,46 and the British pound at R18,74. Gold is selling at $1225,60 a fine ounce and Brent crude oil is quoted at $79,58 a barrel.

5386 2018-10-18 15:49:47 I fervently pray that this particular batch of lies from this vile porcine snake oil salesman, ends his corrupt career. He likes to think he is Churchillean. More like a bleached Jacob Zuma.

5389 2018-10-18 15:49:36 Would it be some kind of crazy, ridiculous, sophomoric pipe dream to come up with a system that could distribute excess rainwater from wet areas of the country to dry? Basically a large-scale (and ethically sound) version of Mulholland's aqueduct? We do it with oil already....
5390 2018-10-18 15:49:26 Bro I was THERE and the stands where *literally* shaking with applause as the solo was still happening. And then he winked. And I swear to God Lucas Oil almost collapsed. People lost their shit. It was beautiful

5403 2018-10-18 15:48:49 they are raising interests rates  and in the last two days  crude out crashed. Oil producers stocks are near the lowest since two years. SO GAZ AT THE PUMP SHOULD BE MUCH LOWER
5404 2018-10-18 15:48:46 Very strong and very dual this situation. USA should not buy a drop of oil to Venezuela
5405 2018-10-18 15:48:46 @Varneyco saying market drop reflects in part possible Saudi retaliation- but then why is oil down? Restricting oil prices most obvious measure/ unless they want to drive price down & kill off US production?

5422 2018-10-18 15:47:20 Hopefully there are enough moderate Saudis that can influence the King to remove MBS and his band of cronies.  If not, they can affect oil prices, do nefarious things in the middle east to undermine the US.  Not that they aren't already. Maybe we open the thwabs on all of  this.

5430 2018-10-18 15:46:28 Farming is an essential part of the Georgia economy, making up $72 billion dollars annually of the states economy. It’s the largest industry in the state and that is purely because that is what we can do.We lack prominence in the energy sector because of the lack of oil and coal.

5437 2018-10-18 15:45:59 The Plam oil Plantations also hurt local villages. They have to put their snares in deminished forests. The competition for space and resources between man and tiger leads to this conflict.
5438 2018-10-18 15:45:57 On what basis do you claim Iran the most aggressive and arrogant? 
They didn’t hijack planes and fly them into our country, and then smile and sell us oil like Saudis scum did.

5446 2018-10-18 15:45:22 MBS, the 33-year-old de facto ruler, has overseen the most fundamental transformation in the modern history of the Gulf nation. He has shaken up the ultra-conservative oil superpower with economic, social and religious reforms since becoming crown prince.
5447 2018-10-18 15:45:12 
5448 2018-10-18 15:45:10 I agree Saudi Arabia is bad but do you really want to have an all out fight with a country control a huge portion of the world's oil. Or destabilize a country who has a prince leader actually trying to big the country from the dark ages? Again stay out of other countrys business!

5451 2018-10-18 15:44:44 We're probably 30 years away from data as a true competitive advantage. So much of work is about self-worth and relevance. Data kneecaps your self-worth. But the companies who do use data successfully = winning now. It's hardly "the new oil" yet, though. Most have no clue.
5452 2018-10-18 15:44:43 You know Bernie it isn't that simple. Other countries are also involved in this. Israel, Syria, Iran, etc. Cut off Saudi Arabia? Oil could go up $200 a barrel. It's a balancing act among countries including the U.S.

5454 2018-10-18 15:44:25 The level of corruption that was perpetrated by the last administration remains unmatched. A whopping sum of $40m was given to a company owned by GEJ’s cousin to fight oil bunkery. The same administration also contracted Tompolo and Dokubo to protect Nigeria’s pipelines.

5459 2018-10-18 15:43:50 Exactly.  It’s amazing how oil can bring together strange bedfellows.
5460 2018-10-18 15:43:46 It's just a representation of worth, in a long line of representations: land, salt, oil, gold, real estate, credit, sugar...

Things of worth keep you alive, sustain you; things of value merely represent worthy things.

Try surviving, solely on that list, and it won't go well.

5464 2018-10-18 15:43:35 Do you go to oil men for all your climate science?  

One thing Alan Chatenay may have a handle on is how many years of fossilized sea creatures we burn as oil each year.  My back of the envelope is about 3 million years worth/year.
5465 2018-10-18 15:42:54 He’s not prominent and he’s no leader. He’s a crazy snake oil salesmen who neither represents conservatives nor Christians. Don’t give this guy any notoriety.

HW Bush helped evacuate Saudi Royals after 9/11 via private jet for oil $$
GW Bush, more oil $$ and fearful of Iran.
Trump? Mueller knows.
5485 2018-10-18 15:41:33 We dont sell our oil for what you see on stock markets. We have to sell at a discount. Last I saw it was $45 per barrel less.
5486 2018-10-18 15:41:32 What oil & billion dollar arms deal have joined together, let no pesky murdered journalist incident put asunder! America’s naked hypocrisy is on full ignoble display. Can America truly gripe about human rights abuses anywhere again, with a straight face? What a disgraceful farce!
5487 2018-10-18 15:41:32 Pay off my credit cards. If there was anything left, get the oil changed on my Camry.

5489 2018-10-18 15:41:27 It will be a cover-up by the USA all will invest and sell arms to Saudi again it will be a statement and formality Saudi oil and business is vital to the western countries
5490 2018-10-18 15:41:25 preaching to the choir ... been pointing this out but Climate myth is constantly drowning us out... who wins with Canada's oil at $28 and no access like middle east to world market....hmmmm...
5491 2018-10-18 15:41:22 The tweets about #Ethiopia getting more bizarre for every day.  “True intentions are like oil in water - eventually it will come to the surface.” Many we thought were HR activists are getting more and more right wings - resembling right wings in western countries.
5492 2018-10-18 15:41:16 Damn it, can't get it in canada. All we have is the helmans olive oil one that contains mostly rapeseed oil with a small amount of olive oil

5507 2018-10-18 15:40:17 Stocks have taken a noticeable turn lower since the Mnuchin announcement. Bond yields lower too. Oil prices higher.

5511 2018-10-18 15:40:08 That is where the trend ordinarily leads. I expect the supply-crunch hysteria to take awhile to wear off. Oil price remains overvalued by $5-$10.

5516 2018-10-18 15:39:50 Yeah, it’s a very complex regional bargain too - Saudi Arabian military intelligence has been cooperative on fighting terrorism, was a key ally against Iran, and boasts incredible oil wealth. So US & Europe forgave it a lot of sins. But Trump just seems to not care that much
5517 2018-10-18 15:39:46 No better way to keep me humble than looking down at the nose oil residue on the lid of my coffee cup.

5535 2018-10-18 15:38:27 My most common quick summary is often something like this: 

"I'm yet to find a single reputable climate scientist or atmospheric physicist not being paid heavily by Big Oil who questions the basic facts that it's real and humans are clearly responsible."

How's that strike you?
5536 2018-10-18 15:38:27 budget deficits and a national debt that will severely reduce government spending. Inflation from tax cuts. Higher interest rates. The business cycle. The impact of trade wars raising prices. Higher oil prices. Etc.

5539 2018-10-18 15:38:11 Greetings @OFIOffice I'm working on an article for Colombian magazine @SosSemana about orangutans, their ecosystem and the devastating consequences of oil palm in their habits. Would it be possible to have an email address to contact you? Thank you!!
5540 2018-10-18 15:38:01 Are you sure this is ofe-owerre? What is all this oil doing here? @Kunnylooney
5541 2018-10-18 15:37:58 It's plain wrong: 1.Didn't attribute any guilt for oil prices slumped 2.Didn't consider social benefits kept during crisis 3.Economic distortion deepen by sanctions 4.Opposition bet on Chavez death to overturn any maduro win 5.Blockchain is a technique that fit economic purposes.
5542 2018-10-18 15:37:57 The oil is  a definite yes. The only (minor) issue I have with it is the (smoking) smell, ugh. Pity they can't make it non-smelly, lol. Used to have neighbours who smoked it every night in their garden. Couldn't have my windows open.
5543 2018-10-18 15:37:51 Sadly it has the person's name on it but I will make beautiful ones for you uncle Akin oil bloc will pay

5565 2018-10-18 15:35:46 Go read your @PeterZeihan .  The war over Asia is not actually over Asia, it's about the 7,000 mile supply line from an increasingly "hot" Middle East that supplies all their oil.
5566 2018-10-18 15:35:42 "Oh sure the US government and Standard Oil literally massacred unions 100 years ago, but they deserved it!"

5576 2018-10-18 15:34:54 Perhaps.  But it smelled a lot better than baby oil and iodine.
5577 2018-10-18 15:34:47 Russia has 11 time zone and vast oil and gas reserves. The US has 6 time zones and we just tapped our stragic reserve ANWR. Can you guess who's military will run out of fuel first?
5578 2018-10-18 15:34:46 Shockingly, this happened in another sovereign country. Doesn't matter that it happened in the Saudi embassy. What is the international community going to do about it? Sadly, nothing. Because of money and oil. Shame on humanity.

5581 2018-10-18 15:34:22 Oil goes to $100/bbl and economic growth stalls immediately. At $150/bbl we have people freezing in their homes. It's easier to talk tough than be tough with the House of Saud.

5583 2018-10-18 15:34:21 Why not?  The problem with ESG is the inherent imprecision & subjectivity of the criteria... everyone can rationalize anything as moral or immoral. Is MBS a reformer or a monster? Oil raises living standards or destroys environment? GMO feeds the world or is an abomination?

5597 2018-10-18 15:33:26 My coconut oil is solid soooooo it’s winter y’all.
5598 2018-10-18 15:33:26 A woman on another thread actually said the loss of life irrelevant if it means price of oil will go up to $90 a barrel.  Apparently murder and torture are ok
5599 2018-10-18 15:33:04 "Oil drops".

As it appears, World is quite unimpressed by Prince Mohammed's 200 $/blb retaliation threat.
5600 2018-10-18 15:32:54 On dat oil and dis shit got me high af 
5601 2018-10-18 15:32:51 When your economy depends on resources, dogma and force are more common and consistent with reality. 
When your economy depends on entrepreneurship and innovation, those things are obstacles to success and go away.
This is 1 big reason to shift from oil to alternative fuels.

5603 2018-10-18 15:32:39 lol what if North Korea had oil & sold to the U.S.
History would be taught waaaaay different huh
5604 2018-10-18 15:32:25 Lol and their excuse would be tamarind scarce.. The peppermint lady told me jollys peppermint oil went up

5607 2018-10-18 15:32:12 .@PhilipRucker The United States no longer depends upon Saudi Arabia for oil. Their contribution to our supply is less than 10%. Pres. Obama worked hard to remove that yoke from our necks. Your info about our oil dependency is as old as Trumps'. At least Google topics b4 tv shows
5608 2018-10-18 15:32:11 Guess I’ll go to the dmv and get a oil change plus wash tomorrow

5613 2018-10-18 15:31:28 Don’t know if you have ever been to the Eastern Shore of Maryland and Va but that is also one of the few remaining places that still have a lot of wilderness and undeveloped coastal marshes and tidal basins. Oil drilling offshore could kill that overnight. It’s just not safe here
5614 2018-10-18 15:31:24 All of the shit storm flying around about the Saudi response if we sanction them really isn't taking into account that they sell to the world market.  Meaning their income stops unless they sell to someone else - which, in turn, frees up the oil that their new customers would
5615 2018-10-18 15:31:23 If you want oil wells off the California coast, by all means vote for Cox, who is a #TOFTer #TakeOrdersFromTrump
5616 2018-10-18 15:31:21 Sir probably Gods  also do  bless people with right intentions... Oil, one thing which can make the fiscal maths topsy turvy in India tops out a month  before key state elections and 7 months before general elections. Everything hopefully should fall in place
5617 2018-10-18 15:31:14 Two reasons: oil and Iran. We used to do anything to keep their oil flowing and they were and our allies against Iran. That is why we did nothing after 19 of their native sons killed ~3,000 people on our soil and destroyed the WTC. Old habits die hard.
5618 2018-10-18 15:31:07 China wants to trade oil in yuan. If MBS stepped down and the next Crowned Prince decides to trade in yuan instead of dollars and the other opec countries follow suit, our economy is fcked. MBS is a modern Saudi ruler. More rights for women; I’ve heard he may allow a  Church.
5619 2018-10-18 15:31:07 The oil does not come from cream.

5621 2018-10-18 15:30:55 Actually you should raise this to the petrol pump or it's owner not the Indian Oil. They are not the one running petrol pump.
5622 2018-10-18 15:30:50 Honestly I’m paying over twice what I was expecting with this oil and tire change it’s ridiculous 
5623 2018-10-18 15:30:42 Surely All the faults including hedging & other decisions are another failure of them
I‘m not a MR regime fan in the first place & all I want to is show that the mere rhetoric that we were selling cheaper than MR isnt correct as world oil prices were expensive than today in 2014
5624 2018-10-18 15:30:41 TRANSLATION....A lot of deaths and a highly publicised "disappearance" of a journo  is likely to have  an effect on our oil supply but because it's Saudi Arabia, let's sweep it under the carpet and not hold them responsible for their actions....the rest of the world's gov isn't!
5625 2018-10-18 15:30:39 I'm so annoyed that Nutella has palm oil in it
5626 2018-10-18 15:30:31 This is empire. The US doesn't even get that much oil from Saudi now. But Saudi is a piece on the grand chess board. Empire is the only remaining domain where normal ppl do truly evil things.

5630 2018-10-18 15:30:18 You may not like the regulatory system for oil and gas & wind, but wind is a scam while fossil fuels are life supporting & saving.  You’re wasting your time by attempts to draft me into sharing your viewpoint.  Carbon Taxation signals we’re open fo biz for organized criminals.

Add a dash of Valentina Mexican hot sauce, and peppery extra virgin olive oil (mine is from Greece)

5635 2018-10-18 15:30:08 My mind has changed on this. Without TMX, the price we are getting for our oil is too low, and we can't afford to host. It sucks, but we have to engage with our reality.
5636 2018-10-18 15:30:07 this is what you get when you put hair oil on your face instead of the hair  (no hate tho) (mans goodlooking)
5637 2018-10-18 15:30:02 Sumatran tigers, the most critically endangered tiger subspecies, are under increasing pressure as their jungle habitat shrinks, largely because of the expansion of palm oil plantations.

5639 2018-10-18 15:29:30 Vietnam was bad...but was a tumultuous situation. we didn't invent North vs South Vietnam. we should've learned from the Korean War and stayed the fuck out. Iraq War was taking out a tyrant who was BAD but we would've ignored if they didn't have oil.

5642 2018-10-18 15:29:16 Really got the urge to chug castor oil cuz I’m in so much discomfort. But I can’t have a kid 10 weeks early. He’s still too small right?
5643 2018-10-18 15:29:16 Good morning. Factory farming of eggs, dairy, and meat deserves as much scrutiny as oil companies for the climate crisis we face.
5644 2018-10-18 15:29:15 Literally me every single time I took my old car for an oil or tire change 
5645 2018-10-18 15:29:06 Ok so 
Holland and Barrett oil of peppermint is a lifesaver
There are bathrooms literally 2 mins away from wherever you are (so your anxiety hopefully won’t flair up in a search)
The food can get me but I just eat slow and pace myself
And the fast rides kinda kick the pain away
5646 2018-10-18 15:29:01 The American economy is based on oil prices. Saudi Arabia has Trump.

5654 2018-10-18 15:28:22 I choose @tedcruz for @TXSen because facts are stubborn things for @betoorourke. In the #TexasDebate, Beto claimed he didn’t vote in favor of a $10-a-barrel tax on oil, but the record shows he did… #ChooseCruz
5655 2018-10-18 15:28:15 The Permian Basin is booming & there’s insufficient infrastructure there to serve all the new oil workers.
For example, there are NOT enough schools for the all the children of the new workers.

5656 2018-10-18 15:28:14 Despite the tension between the US and Saudi, crude oil prices continue to drop, especially the local cash crude price. Hopefully, that will translate into some $aving$ at the pump.
5657 2018-10-18 15:28:11 King Saud sent  his henchmen to destroy the WTC in the 911 attack.  Under no circumstances should we buy one drop of crude from Saudi Arabia or any nation that buys Saudi Arabian oil.  The nation is a dictatorship and it is cruel beyond understanding.  Get them out of our country
5658 2018-10-18 15:28:11 Oil companies are losing money. Canadians work in those companies and employ other Canadian suppliers and contractors.

5660 2018-10-18 15:28:06 It's horrible. For a while I was put on medication that stopped my dreams entirely. My nightmares were so bad I'd stay awake for days. Little things help.

good things today

5664 2018-10-18 15:27:42 Never mind, The kingdom will make restitution with oil deals. What came out of it when Saudi govt murdered over 50 Yemini under age pupils? Is Khashoggi's blood human than the 50 murdered Yemeni children? America govt is overwhelmed with double standard.
5665 2018-10-18 15:27:41 In the 70's Kissinger mada a deal  with Saudis. All Saudi oil is traded ONLY in US dollars. All of it. To every country. If Japan wants oil, they need US dollars to buy it - so, they sell us everything from cars to electronics. Brush up on history. Its important.
5666 2018-10-18 15:27:40 #MSNBC @realDonaldTrump is a coward. He would never stand up to other bullies cuz it is what cowsrds do. He cares about HIS OWN MONEY @PhilipRucker SO STOP SELLING TRUMP BS that he cares about America. Trump & your spinning argument about oil prices is ludicrous bc high prices
5667 2018-10-18 15:27:34 @potus has expressed his concerns about damaging the relationship with Saudi Arabia. The investment in arms could move to China or Russia for arms imports, also depends on Saudi Arabia for oil stability, within the kingdomwould be “stabbing its economy to death”
5668 2018-10-18 15:27:29 Scientists. Why is the oil industry subsidised? Why did we bail out the banks? Capitalism is a parasite. See a shrink, you've been brainwashed.
5669 2018-10-18 15:27:28 Wannan Gardiyar?

5672 2018-10-18 15:27:16 The vegans that want everyone to go vegan are racist af.
Erase all cultural foods and traditions to feed their meat-free egos instead of addressing the root cause of climate change: Big oil (wars/production) and the unrestrained capitalism that it nourishes.

Maybe consider this Aberdeen city has got over 200 food bank charities which tells u a story about how hard some people get by in this so called oil capital..
5675 2018-10-18 15:27:11 #IStandWithSaudiArabia  because it's my land and I'm native Arabic girl. My grandfathers never immigrated to any country before they knew there is an oil. 
The Saudi family United us against the colonies before they knew there is oil.
5676 2018-10-18 15:27:09 He needs the oil, they will sweep under the rug you can bet that.
5677 2018-10-18 15:27:00 Unfortunately, we should cut our dependence on oil. It's making us complicit to this crime. And worse, it's accelerating our environmental demise.

We're all invested in clean air, water, etc. too. But if we don't take action, we've only got ~20-30 years left.
5678 2018-10-18 15:26:59 NFL operates like a wildcatter, drilling holes, pumping out all the oil and moving on. I guess it shouldn't be surprising, with Jerra's background.
5679 2018-10-18 15:26:56 A few mores days to get heir stories straight. Truthfully, what’s the next move- proper move- by the US, UK and other allies? Would not not behoove is to sanction the Saudis and In turn fill the oil void by continuing to pump and export to our Euro and Asian allies?
5680 2018-10-18 15:26:54 Trying to get my oil changed right after work.

5683 2018-10-18 15:26:39 How can you say the project is not financially responsible. Alberta oil is selling for $20 a barrel. More pipelines will help us get closer to the $70 for WTI.
5684 2018-10-18 15:26:32 Based on NYT story, appears US & SA working ham-handedly to develop acceptable cover story for killing of Khashoggi. @realDonaldTrump, @SecPompeo have abrogated US values for $ and oil. Lack of coherent Mid-East policy is reason for situation. #NeverTrump #LiarInChief
5685 2018-10-18 15:26:29 Realmente han cambiado los tiempos. Yo ya no le veo nada atractivo a cejas pintadas, pelo decolorado, brazo de tamalera...ahora va más la naturalidad. Me pasa un poco como con los Beatles, qué bueno que les gusten a uds pero a mí ya me dan huevita.

If we did not rely on Oil we have no need to be pushed around by Saudi Arabia or any other country that

5690 2018-10-18 15:26:00 As price of crude oil soars in the intl market, the price of products climb as  well so the landing cost gap with retail price widen further, its something simple but as usual, Atikulators are half smart.
5691 2018-10-18 15:25:51 Because Iran doesn’t have an oil deal with the US and wants to move away from selling oil in US dollars (petrodollar) which is what primarily props up the US economy and keeps it as the world reserve currency.

5693 2018-10-18 15:25:47 The question you need to ask is why did the government buy oil at a higher price than the market price. The answer is we were obliged thanks to the hedging deal.

5695 2018-10-18 15:25:43 Watching Salt Fat Acid Heat and I am ashamed by how I never considered the expiration date of olive oil 
5696 2018-10-18 15:25:24 It doesn't require pipelines or tankers full of oil, it isn't useless on a cloudy or windless day, it doesn't produce any greenhouse gases, and the waste is easily manageable. The Green party should be all over this.
5697 2018-10-18 15:25:22 It's too bad that the "morality judges" are really nothing but crooks themselves.  Just like the snake oil salesmen of old, these guys will do anything for a buck.
5698 2018-10-18 15:25:16 It is double advantage for soya and cotton processors like Gael.  Exports realisation increasing due to rupee depreciation and trade war affecting soya meal exports from America.  Secondly rupee depreciation making imported oil expensive so local oil realisation very good

5705 2018-10-18 15:24:45 did we stop doing business with Paskistan when they killed Danny Pearl? I don't believe this guy is even dead? the Turks want to take ove the whole middle east? the Truks have been helping AQ for years? think about it? SA was against the Iran deal? turks took the oil on the cheep
5706 2018-10-18 15:24:41 Or we could use tax revenues from the increase in oil production and possibly abolish personal income taxes instead of implementing social programs that would collapse if we ever had a global recession

5711 2018-10-18 15:24:23 Jesus, this sounds like some sort of scam email. Or some sort of late night infomercial. "for only $99.99 all my problems were cured!" A part of me feels really sad for you idiots being scammed out of your money but the other part of me feels like you all deserve it. Snake oil.
5712 2018-10-18 15:24:21 Agree. With the oil, mineral, farmland and lumber riches that zone would be divided between the two victors. Ultimately dystopian tales depress and wear me down. Hard to envision any meaningful story progression from here.
5713 2018-10-18 15:24:19 Lets burn the midnight oil, lads.
5714 2018-10-18 15:24:19 So epidiolex is an alcohol extracted oil which is done to remove chlorophyll, Bedrocan is the whole herb which is usually vaped and Sativex is a mouth spray which uses alcohol as an antidote to glycol toxicity.

5730 2018-10-18 15:23:22 @DoorDash_Help I tried putting in feedback online but nowhere to do it and kept giving me a blank screen. I live in suburbs and order a decent amount. I am tired of cleaning up oil from the dashes parking in my driveway like they live their just to make a delivery.
5731 2018-10-18 15:23:15 The men on the expedition felt overwhelmed by their most ancient memories in that paradise of dampness and silence, going back to before original sin, as their boots sank into pools of steaming oil and their machetes destroyed bloody lilies and golden salamanders.

5755 2018-10-18 15:21:01 They also say they "support our troops", but it seems they secretly hate our troops. They elect people to Congress who send our troops to die in wars for oil. They also rabidly support the only President who hasn't visited troops in a war zone. #Resist all #Trumpfellas!

5799 2018-10-18 15:17:49 Seriously, though, progressives really need to counter the whole Soros canard with a litany of Kochs and Mercers and Thiels. Same as climate change; there's way more money to be had from the oil companies to argue against than the small research grants for legit climate science.
5800 2018-10-18 15:17:47 We DON'T need Saudi oil.  When will you people start checking your facts?  And what the hell is refuneriyin?  We have enough oil in this country for our needs, right from here.

a) want their oil
b) we want military bases there
5817 2018-10-18 15:16:26 If the senate caves, nothing will be done but buy more Saudi oil and sell more US arms. Watching for the Iran situation to get icky. It's #MAGA, baby!

5825 2018-10-18 15:15:45 This is just a lot of noise from Mr Sanders.  By 'reevaluate' he means speak a lot about it but leave it the way it is.  The Saudis have a lot of money and a lot of oil.  That pretty much sums up our relationship with them.

5844 2018-10-18 15:14:29 It's distressing that neither of the two main political parties in the US have any plans to curb emissions and prevent the worst effects of climate change.

5856 2018-10-18 15:13:36 Sigh need a oil change ..
5857 2018-10-18 15:13:32 Let the facts unfold. Remember that we are all invested in Saudi Arabia thanks to oil. Reguardless of that, facts matter and we should let them unfold.
5858 2018-10-18 15:13:31 In the first two weeks of October, Iran’s oil exports averaged more than 2.2 million barrels a day, the FT reports. That is far higher than market prices reflect and implies that Iran’s oil exports have fallen only about 10%.

5861 2018-10-18 15:13:25 got a little bottle for $7 at TJMaxx, washed my face, put on hot towel then I applied the oil. Woke up feeling amazing!!
5862 2018-10-18 15:13:22 why is it whenever you take your car in for a simple oil change they come back in like “oh yeah your whole car’s fucked but we’ll fix it for 150 more dollars”
5863 2018-10-18 15:13:17 And basically none of it went over seas or got some magically better "tidewater price" so can we drop that phony talking point and admit all the oil will keep going to the US?
5864 2018-10-18 15:13:16 And paid by oil revenue, no doubt.
5865 2018-10-18 15:13:09 Sabihan kita be kapag kakain na ako ulit sa @manginasal at pupunta lang ako kung may media advisory na nagbalik muli si CHICKEN OIL :) AHAHAHA 
5866 2018-10-18 15:13:02 But he won't, he'll still sell them weapons and buy their oil, and you'll still think Trump shits ice cream.
5867 2018-10-18 15:12:59 Why do mechanics always try to finagle you bruh . I JUST WANT THE OIL CHANGE .
5868 2018-10-18 15:12:56 成功から学べないのはその成功がゴールだと思ってる人なだけだと思う
5869 2018-10-18 15:12:54 I am not stupid, but I know that socialism is a ploy for conformity. I also know that the #NWO crowd wants chaos by any means necessary and they have a penchant for oil and gold. Why only insult? We can speak to one another.
5870 2018-10-18 15:12:46 Also note that Price of Brent is used as s benchmark- not me even the government ministers often quoted this price when they refer to oil price
5871 2018-10-18 15:12:45 おおかっこいい
5872 2018-10-18 15:12:43 @javeednusrat @BolBolPakistan_ 
Sir, Imran & Asad have not said we shall not go to IMF. They used word probably.They have to go not only to IMF but, to others too. Saudi could supply oil on credit and China two billion, not resolve the required target of finance for the country.
5873 2018-10-18 15:12:39 Older folks and technology are like water and oil.
5874 2018-10-18 15:12:33 I hate gettin oil changes ppl wanna goof they dumb fuckin asses off in the back when they have a whole fuckin job to do
5875 2018-10-18 15:12:31 "Experts and aides". LMAO. nothing interferes with the oil and weapons bidness. You know this
5876 2018-10-18 15:12:25 I burned my face w tea tree oil

5882 2018-10-18 15:11:54 Oil? Hahaha
5883 2018-10-18 15:11:53 I swear, every post in a vegan Facebook group will give you an aneurism.
This lady posted about snacking on popcorn with Olive Oil & Noosh and half of the comments were telling her "oil isn't plant based"
5884 2018-10-18 15:11:52 nanti pas muncul ini tu nyut2an. kalo aku ditotolin obat jerawat saja. aku pakai tamanu oil
5885 2018-10-18 15:11:51 Trump’s Iran action is motivated to enrich Saudi’s. Oil money to spend on weapons to kill kids with Trump’s approval are grounds to remove him for being complicit in war crimes. U.N. Now should step in and become involved in prosecuting Saudi’s actions (and Trump) 
5886 2018-10-18 15:11:44 Cannabis oil saved my husband life in 2016. Esophageal cancer. His oncology team were stunned. I'm thrilled it's been legalized across the country.
5887 2018-10-18 15:11:43 just now waking up when I was supposed to be up two hours ago to get a oil change 
5888 2018-10-18 15:11:42 Convinced my coworkers my oil pen is a vape >>>
5889 2018-10-18 15:11:33 Are you telling me oil was bought cheaper during 2013 & 2014 than what it was in past 3+ years?
5890 2018-10-18 15:11:21 Well maintained cars are safer cars, so it’s important to make sure you change your oil on a regular basis. Regular inspections are also important to make sure that all the parts of your car (engine to tires) are working properly.
5891 2018-10-18 15:10:59 Nothing good can come from Beto representing Texas! TEXANS DONT WANT: 
1. Abolition of ICE, 2. Open borders, 3. Hike in taxes on our oil,4. Hike up our gas prices .24 cents a gallon 5. Gun restrictions 6. To be like California. End of story.
5892 2018-10-18 15:10:59 It is very alarming what is happening in the world right now. Never mind climate change. Trump is in bed with the Russians and the Saudis. The American oil industry is paying off protestors to block canadian export markets so that the US refineries can their feed stock at -30%
5893 2018-10-18 15:10:54 My cousin and her husband who is an oil worker at one of the indigenous oil company have gone to join her brother. Her sister  and another cousin are leaving soon. At this rate it will be Christmas in Vancouver for me
5894 2018-10-18 15:10:53 Sir, FYA: Grade C Engg exam final result of @oilpr not declared from 1 year. Seems @oilpr (OIL) has no time frame in mind. The HR officials there are unprofessional & clueless. Pls urge @oilpr to declare results ASAP. @PetroleumMin @PMO @PrakashJavdekar @BJP4India
5895 2018-10-18 15:10:47 what really worrying me (and must other world) - is that Putin basically provided China free russian oil supply for next 50(!) years. Without asking anyone 2 years ago he signed that "slavery" contract with stealing the advance payment. This topic is really forcibly silenced here
5896 2018-10-18 15:10:44 Hi @Fidelity, I'm still upset that there are multiple oil, petroleum and refinery companies in my 'sustainable' mutual fund from you!
5897 2018-10-18 15:10:43 Same thing is true on oil rigs. The stories I read on Reddit threads about my mines post had Alaskan oil workers making tech wages.
5898 2018-10-18 15:10:42 You need some braid itch spray or some oil 
5899 2018-10-18 15:10:40 Shit a oil change is $free.99.. 
5900 2018-10-18 15:10:21 Before y’all start talking to niggas, ask that nigga does he know how to change a tire, change oil, shit can the nigga at least change a headlight lmao

5902 2018-10-18 15:10:06 Except that oil companies haven't figured out how to control every bit of that technology.

5905 2018-10-18 15:09:54 I hate having to get oil changes , but I learned my lesson last car . 
5906 2018-10-18 15:09:47 Dinosaur Pat Robertson needs to turn himself into oil, if he truly loves Jesus, so we won't need oil from Saudi Arabia anymore.
5907 2018-10-18 15:09:41 Remember how they said, if something tastes good, it's bad for you? Well no it's not.  Butter tastes good, olive oil tastes good. Canola oil does not taste good.
5908 2018-10-18 15:09:29 @WHO @UN @UNICEF @UNHumanRights @UN_Women @WHO & fall asleep because the bridegroom  (Jesus) is delaying, when he finally does call for you (in the night) you may not have the oil you need to light a lamp that will lead you to him, the bridegroom, for salvation and forgiveness (4

5910 2018-10-18 15:09:17 How often should I change the oil in my spaceship? It's turned a bright purple color and I don't think that's right.
5911 2018-10-18 15:09:09 @craigmelvin @HansNichols .. @SecPompeo is a real stupid *sucker* for believing & allowing Saudis to self-investigate!! ..in the name of oil & $$$$$$. More emphasis s/b on how difficult it'll be for Russia/China to sell Saudis weapons & them to change all equipment!! @MSNBC
5912 2018-10-18 15:08:44 Good morning world I started crying in Bacon Tire and Alignment bc of a commercial I saw on their tv where there was a baby duck in some oil
5913 2018-10-18 15:08:33 @UN @UNICEF @UNHumanRights @UNDP @UNCTAD Matthew 25:1 Then the Kingdom of the heavens may be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. -Jesus uses this illustration to warn the people. If you (the virgin) don't keep an eye on your oil (pt 3)
5914 2018-10-18 15:08:31 You can’t do that with oil paint, it’d crack
5915 2018-10-18 15:08:30 What a mealy-mouthed response. Palm oil is produced, animals die as a result. Just stop it! The sound you hear is generations of Christian Rowntrees spinning on their graves!
5916 2018-10-18 15:08:28 Getting an oil change. Yeah I’m a couple thousand miles behind but hey, I AM HERE
5917 2018-10-18 15:08:26 We need to get our oil from somewhere. Venezuela down, Iraq rebuilding. This has been obvious for years. Even previous admin ignored abuses.

5924 2018-10-18 15:08:06 The oil they are fighting for or the elites wanna have it it's actally the menstural blood of the Mother Godesss Queen of all Stars/Gaia. To give them an long life while they sending their soliders to these useless wars and they give their life for it not  knowing the real deal.

5926 2018-10-18 15:07:57 It’s not just the oil profits they lie about @ScotNational
5927 2018-10-18 15:07:53 It happens...wonder what’s next
“Suspect eaten by camels”
“Man falls on kitchen knife set before interrogation”
“Freak accidental fall into crude oil storage tank”

WH put out falsenarrative
5930 2018-10-18 15:07:28 Look online for cannabis oil for the pain, it's not cheap but worth it if it means you're not in pain and maybe buy some green too, that'll get you to sleep lol
5931 2018-10-18 15:07:28 We are opened Tonite ...If you make it in,check out the new CBD products that are available from a Canadian company. I have been using their oil for about a year now and have felt the benefits.
5932 2018-10-18 15:07:23 So I got super "medicated" last night. I'm still high as fuck. First time using the oil (98%THC).
5933 2018-10-18 15:07:13 When a door is squeaking, apply WD40 repeatedly until every squeak is satisfied. Squeaks are a sign of wear and deterioration...in humans they are a symptom of pain, weakening, ineffective function. Jesus would apply more OIL...go and do likewise!
5934 2018-10-18 15:07:12 One more gem : Beto is for open borders Not going to happen in Texas. Why would we want to vote for a candidate who wants to raise gas prices, tax our oil, and supports the abolition of ICE?  We want NONE of the things!
5935 2018-10-18 15:07:10 I've lived through multiple oil embargoes. Every time afterwards, the Government says "This won't happen again". Here we are, 50 years out, STILL held hostage by Saudi Arabia. Fuck them. Fuck big oil. #Hydrogen Fuel cell is here. Someone make the switch.
5936 2018-10-18 15:06:53 BC touched Hillary and she was no oil painting.
5937 2018-10-18 15:06:30 And the list goes on herbs, strawberries, grapes, potatoes, cabbage and many more have been growing naturally without chemicals ..
I can also use 
'AQUA VIVA' for Firefighting all types of wildfire, gas fires, fuel/oil fires and house fires with extraordinary results.
5938 2018-10-18 15:06:24 I don't want to say New Jersey is perfect, but the condition of our roads and their capacity is much better than most states.  We could do better ... but we should think about improving the rail and tunnels we need when oil is $1000 a barrel.
5939 2018-10-18 15:06:22 Stick to selling your Snake oil!
5940 2018-10-18 15:06:10 7:20am. An hour and a half into our road trip. Blasting lil jon. My brother coughing to death from an oil pen in the back seat.
5941 2018-10-18 15:06:06 How is it not a success? Coal use is down. Thirty years ago, GHG emissions were mostly coal; today they're mostly oil.
5942 2018-10-18 15:06:01 My gran had a similar recipe and didn’t exactly clean the pan or change the oil between uses.  The pan lived on the stove and was used for chicken and other things.     So tasty and possibly dangerous....but tasty.
5943 2018-10-18 15:05:59 Marijuana has been around & used medicinally for thousands of years. I personally use CBD oil for chronic back pain, I was prescribed Vicodin for 10+ years,& not only does it work, it is completely non-addictive. Ask a cop who’d they’d rather confront a drunk or a person on pot.
5944 2018-10-18 15:05:57 Nope. Now is the moment to end our dependence on fossil fuel (= Saudi oil among others) which makes us a whore for whichever pimp has a well. Cut off ALL trade with the murdering bastards (Yemeni casualties beyond count) until they disappear from the planet.
5945 2018-10-18 15:05:57 How can they? MBS has a 10 Billion dollar stake in an oil refinery in Texas! So not only to I fear his “influence”  on the midterms there, but now SE owns OUR oil too??
5946 2018-10-18 15:05:49 Motor oil po talaga yung facial cream ni Honeylet
5947 2018-10-18 15:05:48 @benignant101 ano gamit mo na oil?
5948 2018-10-18 15:05:47 Still thirsts for saudis oil monies.
5949 2018-10-18 15:05:39 @JoeBiden and all the dems calling for action against Saudi Arabia prior to the facts. Why? So when they raise oil to $300 a barrel, you can blame the @realDonaldTrump ? Nice try.

5953 2018-10-18 15:05:25 Utilities here are open, you can buy power from many different companies.

I can't speak to the situation there, but many power companies here have no ties to oil/gas/coal companies, they buy on the wholesale market and sell to consumers.

Power delivery is a public utility.
5954 2018-10-18 15:05:24 Or they just pass the coat to the consumer, yes? In Ontario, Wynne's carbon tax added ¢4.5/L of gasoline. It wasn't the oil companies paying.
5955 2018-10-18 15:05:22 Fuck the Saudis and their oil. This should be the impetus for moving to renewable energies, but corrupt @realDonaldTrump is gonna protect his bottom line and sell out this country AGAIN.
5956 2018-10-18 15:05:20 In other words -- look at the big picture. Oil Oil.  Trump's Investments in Saudi, Kushner is buddy buddy.  So both countries will take a few days to spin this and then come up with some story to frame some low lying dude and move on.
5957 2018-10-18 15:05:20 Depends on what works for you  I use one of them natural bristle brushes and stopped using wash cloth on my face cause it ripped my skin up. Also I follow up with vitamin E oil (I have a thin one and a thicc one)
5958 2018-10-18 15:05:18 And meanwhile the USA and the west will do sod all against the Saudi's because of the Oil and money.
5959 2018-10-18 15:05:17 Not if it Interferes with the flow of money and oil...

5972 2018-10-18 15:04:42 You literally know nothing about the global oil industry. So don’t go there.
5973 2018-10-18 15:04:36 Your research is appalling and not up to the standards of a community rag, let alone a national newspaper. Oil is present, in great quantities and is confirmed by leading analysts. Shame your article hasn't had the same in-depth scrutiny!
5974 2018-10-18 15:04:32 I discovered a (kinda new) hobby: oil painting on walls/making murals :)))
5975 2018-10-18 15:04:24 @KateBolduan Pompeo sounded like a hired spokesman for the Saudi Royals. Purposely bland. No condemnation of murder of Washington Post journalists. No mention of oil.
5976 2018-10-18 15:04:19 There are many reasons to admire RRC Commissioner @ChristiCraddick,  but We appreciate her efforts to fight human trafficking and to help the #oil field fight this evil.

5985 2018-10-18 15:03:53 Personally don't think there will ever be a replacement for good old oil. Hopefully renewable will compete some day. But many people can't afford a hike at the pump or in the power bill. If the free market does the work, the price of energy should drop.
5986 2018-10-18 15:03:53 Predominantly its vegetable oil! Who the hell are you kidding!
5987 2018-10-18 15:03:51 Ok so apparently you’re supposed to get a oil change every 3,000 miles on your car or some shit and I’m way past that point soooo I gotta put my grown woman who don’t need no man pants on and go get this oil change 
5988 2018-10-18 15:03:49 Ahh well I hope you feel better soon Jacqui good to hear cannabis oil is working for you aswell
5989 2018-10-18 15:03:42 Oil - Oil - Oil. Pompeo is a Koch man. He represents their interests. Their main business is oil. They need to make sure the Saudis will not make a move in the oil market which may impact their revenues. Come on, NBC, dig a little deeper.

5998 2018-10-18 15:03:12 Canada is getting less than a 1/4 value for our oil.   How long do you think we can keep that up? 

Alberta's economy isn't strong.  Why not come here, drive though Nisku or Red Deer and look at the business closures,  service trucks and rigs in the yards.

5999 2018-10-18 15:03:05 I agree. But it's not as easy as flipping a switch, especially as US companies are making so much money in oil/gas at the moment. Wrong people in govt to prompt such a change as well.
6000 2018-10-18 15:02:56 ‘Rejected’? Either they approach you to write on a topic because they acknowledge that you’re an expert, or they are simply soliciting scribes. Either way, the expectations should be clear.
6001 2018-10-18 15:02:50 And the 470 iraki journalist tortured and killed by US army ? + 16 foreigner journalist during the war ? just because they reported USA army crimes ... hope u got all the oil u needed with that, leav arabs alone now.
6002 2018-10-18 15:02:49 Gave an interview to "News Nation" on "issues relating to Pakistan's weak economy, Pakistan's covert support to terror activities on its soil & its impact on economic assistance as well as on US sanctions on Iran & its impact on oil prices in India & the world", this evening....
6003 2018-10-18 15:02:47 We carry 100% pure essential oil therapeutic grade. Wellness blend, Energize blend and we have added Sleep blend just to name a few.
6004 2018-10-18 15:02:47 I think there are a lot in Chicago. Trips to Evanston, West Lafayette, and even Champagne and Bloomington always seem to have HUGE turn outs. Would love to see them back at Lucas Oil the first week of December soon!!
6005 2018-10-18 15:02:40 Ol boy said 1k a month was a good deal cuz they include oil changes and stuff too...

Thats really sad.

6007 2018-10-18 15:02:14 The media should be embracing this news, instead they are trying to offer themselves up as superior creatures with no requirement of oil or gas! This is really good news potentially for the UK but they talk about it like its ebola!
6008 2018-10-18 15:02:06 Bedrolite is alcohol extracted that could be why the list of ingredients on epediolex says alcohol but from the colour of the oil it looks c02 extract but that is probably just because it isolate

6011 2018-10-18 15:01:55 The US currently produces more oil than any other country
6012 2018-10-18 15:01:55 would you please translate?
6013 2018-10-18 15:01:53 US imports most of the oil from Canada not the Middle East.

6016 2018-10-18 15:01:49 そらちゃんのこと泣かせちゃった……。
6017 2018-10-18 15:01:47 Because the Saudis can pump more oil so we can enforce sanctions on Iran which kills even more people. Who are we to judge after Obama drone strikes an American enemies?
6018 2018-10-18 15:01:42 Went to get my wife oil changed and ran into my brother I haven’t seen in about 2 years
6019 2018-10-18 15:01:31 The .@gop is owned by the Oil industry which is owned by the Saudis. Bandar Bush and the whole rotten lying pack of greedy Texans.
The oil economy is now the greatest threat to our lives and freedom. 

It took a Democrat to kill Osama.
6020 2018-10-18 15:01:29 Do we want a another 1970 oil lines ?  We do not produce enough oil as we ship Alaska. Oil to China and Japan . So they do not have to deal with middle East . Besides what rest of world doing about it ?
6021 2018-10-18 15:01:28 Lying Ted willing to do anything to win ! Gas prices has been going up while you work with a very corrupt Texas oil & gas industry ! Taxing your constituents with higher prices ! “Trickledown economics bad for Texans “
6022 2018-10-18 15:01:27 Now this is just so wrong on so many levels
6023 2018-10-18 15:01:11  Avocado Toast with prosciutto, hot peppers, tomato, cucumber, salt pepper, oil and lemon juice.
6024 2018-10-18 15:01:05 Mustard ingredients say vinegar and spices only. 

No starches or vegetable oil. 

I was pleasently surprised.
6025 2018-10-18 15:01:05 Made $11K shorting #oil earlier. That was it for me. Even for the week. 

You guys have a good weekend. Ciao.

6026 2018-10-18 15:01:01 there's not much national security when we import 45% of our oil. does it matter who says that? I dont think so.
6027 2018-10-18 15:00:55 Pompeo is a longtime Koch man. The Kochs are in the oil business. Oil is the common factor here. The Kochs want to placate the Saudis as regards any possible aggressive oil moves which may impact their oil revenues.
6028 2018-10-18 15:00:44 There're around 400 Sumatran Tiger left in Indonesia including those in captivity. Deforestation, poaching and forest turned into palm oil plantation lead to Tiger vs human conflict and it will get worse fast in the near future. Same with Sumatran Elephant & Orang Utan as well.

6037 2018-10-18 14:59:55 Actually the Holy oil can be used for antiperspirant too. I'm working on making a good stick deodorant now. The natural ones I've tried have a lot to be desired.
6038 2018-10-18 14:59:49 i am really upset with my weak knee govt who cannot see beyond US trump(card). we need cheap oil not us. we have nuclear neighbours. what's wrong with Iran ? everybody knows nuclear war is a theory. it is not good to anybody.
6039 2018-10-18 14:59:46 On the same boat but I bought MPL oil 3 days ago and my hair is showing a huge difference. 
6040 2018-10-18 14:59:46 @qikipedia Q: Are there any lighthouses that still burn whale oil today?
6041 2018-10-18 14:59:45 With ground-nut oil
6042 2018-10-18 14:59:37 To @realDonaldTrump and Congress.    Please stop supporting Saudi Arabia.  They may have oil, but they are terrorists.  Humanity must be our guide not power, oil, and money.
6043 2018-10-18 14:59:33 more garbage reports... How much coal fired energy does it take to build ONE of this ugly bloody wind turbines ??  and the amount of oil it takes to keep them running !! They will be left rusting in the fields ! and YOU should have to pay to clean them up !
6044 2018-10-18 14:59:27 THC gets taken out, when they make CBD oil. I think, it's also a legal requirement too.
6045 2018-10-18 14:59:17 I remember eschewing SP4 suntan oil in exchange for baby oil and an aluminum reflecting shield. MAXIMUM SKIN FRYING. 

She does look pretty plastic.
6046 2018-10-18 14:59:13 Don’t Buy Big Oil’s Lies: The #ethanol produced for fuel is so clean, you could add it to a cocktail.  We don’t recommend it because it doesn’t taste good. But it won’t hurt you, unlike the cancer causing #aromatics oil companies add to fuel. #FixOurFuel
6047 2018-10-18 14:59:02 Alcohol extraction for the oil which is normal, other companies use C02 extraction that gets rid of chlorophyll.
6048 2018-10-18 14:58:56 I super recommend trying to wash it less. The process is going to be oily but eventually after a few weeks your hair will get used to the frequency and begin to produce less oil since it doesn’t think it’s about to get stripped of it so soon again!

6051 2018-10-18 14:58:32 The product which is used to clean oil and fuels off mammals & birds can and has been used for treatment and cleansing "PSORIASIS" 
Psoriasis is a debilitating disease, many of us know people who suffer from this .. I've been making this product for 20 years with amazing results.
6052 2018-10-18 14:58:31 try this acne cream called Keeva! It's an all organic tea tree oil cream. Apply it after you wash your face! Been using it almost a week and can already tell a difference!
6053 2018-10-18 14:58:19 According to Revelation in the Bible, there will be people boiling in oil, we are headed toward that unless we get a grip on extremism of all kinds. America used to be the vision of hope, now WE are not living up to our founders dream.
6054 2018-10-18 14:58:19 Where are they going to get their oil, electricity, fish and whisky from then? I hope that Norwegian interconnector still going ahead...

6070 2018-10-18 14:56:58 Chemo kills so if anyone does even the slightest bit of homework getting educated on the subject nobodybwould do chemo. There are soooo many other great natural cures, for instance cannabis oil cures cancer. Plus there are clinics that don’t do chemo and radiation.
6071 2018-10-18 14:56:54 Right.  Saddam's Iraq would have lived happily ever after with two genocides happening at once, along with attendant environmental destruction, UN defiance, and menacing the neighbors.  Back when the free world was dependent on Saudi oil.
6072 2018-10-18 14:56:50 Stop fooling around and tell use how the  price of a barrel of oil landed cost day at $ 80 and exchange rate at say 170 translate to a rs/lt for diesel and petrol and kerosene
6073 2018-10-18 14:56:38 H2 power is the ideal gift from the gods for big oil and petrol station companies as it allows them to cartel and screw us users with huge prices - just like they are doing with petrol/diesel. Electricity is not perfect but it gives us options and freedoms that big oil hate!

6081 2018-10-18 14:56:05  Tune up, oil change, windshield wipers, get my heat fix and new tires. If it aint one thing of another  gotta get winter ready
6082 2018-10-18 14:55:48 Lets talk about Ukraine and China, Joe? Your son, The Oligarchs, The Communist, Kerry and those backdoor investments (Oil & Real Estate) and technology deals?
6083 2018-10-18 14:55:36 Protectionist strategy throws typical fed playbook out the window. Higher dollar will make imports cheaper keeping inflation down. Market growth is high but take away oil/food which is volatile, inflation has been modest which is why a rate increase is mainly for market cooling
6084 2018-10-18 14:55:34 Nor should you. The argument, if you can call it that, is, "Oil Country is a fan of the Edmonton Oilers. Therefore, the Toronto Maple Leafs shouldn't trade William Nylander for a defenseman."

Doesn't even remotely make sense.

6086 2018-10-18 14:55:15 I could be completely wrong, but if we were as dependent on the Saudis for oil as we once were, the CIA might have concocted a story for them. Perhaps I’m just cynical.

PDP ruled for 16 yrs, earned over $800 billion from crude oil alone, did not deliver electricity, roads, rail or anything notable. Looted billions of $, now lines up d chief looter in Atiku to run d nation.

6096 2018-10-18 14:54:42 We need one of them on our side or they can cause the price of oil to spike and throw our economy in a recession like in the late 70’s.  Without them, any large oil producer can hold the US hostage.   It is ugly, but they are not a geopolitical threat

6110 2018-10-18 14:53:55 No problem, i think it's absolutely fucked for a foreign government owned company to own the largest oil refinery in the US. It boggles my mind.
6111 2018-10-18 14:53:55 I would like the oil to be left in the ground for future generations as a kind of energy insurance.

6113 2018-10-18 14:53:48 On my FL ballot is a state amendment which would both ban offshore OIL DRILLING.. AND regulate VAPING in offices. Quite a combo! Regardless of your stance on either (totally unrelated!) issue, it’s silly. I’m beginning to suspect our system of lawmaking may be out of whack

6129 2018-10-18 14:52:43 So you want a 1970 oil lines again ? As we ship Alaska oil to China and Japan so they don't have to deal with the middle East . And who was against oil drilling ? Dems want you to buy a limited range electric cars to drive up electric cost .
6130 2018-10-18 14:52:39 
6131 2018-10-18 14:52:28 Actually price matters more than volume if you analyze oil companies

6135 2018-10-18 14:52:08 A bushel of wheat used to be the same price as a barrel of oil, so who is taking the hit? Supply and demand works in all open market systems. Simple math.
6136 2018-10-18 14:52:06 @realDonaldTrump u looking at khashoggi file isn't the most fair set of eyes if you're automatically favoring the saudi prince. he locked his own parents up. khashoggi was cousins w/Dodi Fayed,.... this is abt power/oil/$/shutting up a man's voice. brutal murder. dodi/diana, same
6137 2018-10-18 14:52:02 Bitch they told me that when I just changed my oil... I said “ok let me get with my dude and I’ll be back tomorrow 
6138 2018-10-18 14:51:52 The Exxon Valdez Oil disaster in Alaska comes to memory .. we're still not aware of the extent of damage on the environment and broader community. I'm sick of presenting my products to people in high places to no avail ..
6139 2018-10-18 14:51:48 I choose @tedcruz for @TXSen because facts are stubborn things for @betoorourke. In the #TexasDebate, Beto claimed he didn’t vote in favor of a $10-a-barrel tax on oil, but the record shows he did… #ChooseCruz
6140 2018-10-18 14:51:45 they are already unionized, in California at least. Most of the oil industries political power here comes from their unions. 

I think the idea of nationalizing is more that it'd be easier to pivot the workers to green jobs.
6141 2018-10-18 14:51:44 What would you like to do? Carpet bomb them? Yes taking that much oil offline effects the price everywhere. Where our oil comes from is irrelevant. The US Constitution doesn't apply to Saudi Arabia.
6142 2018-10-18 14:51:41 It's in the Torah. Once the oil goes on hang onto your nuts and your wallet!!
6143 2018-10-18 14:51:25 Moisturize in coconut oil
6144 2018-10-18 14:51:17 frame this !!!! this looks like an oil painting
6145 2018-10-18 14:51:09 Near 75 in short term  good for us as country. Hope it comes sooner...appears Saudi issue is negotiated by some deal, Iran is still issue. It should settle in 70-75 range over 9 months. 85+ is not sustainable and will work for bankruptcy of oil counties in long run.
6146 2018-10-18 14:51:08 What have you heard about the Benefits of CBD oil? 

Do You know the Benefits of CBD oil? 

P.S. I know a guy who makes it his business to know. I can hook you up. :)
6147 2018-10-18 14:50:59 really? theres oil and gas on both ends of the car.
6148 2018-10-18 14:50:58 I hate when the dealerships keep trying to add shit to an oil change  like no bruh I don’t want an hydraulic system for an extra 1k 
6149 2018-10-18 14:50:57 Also use vitamin e oil. Ampro style have this sunflower oil I LOVE!
6150 2018-10-18 14:50:50 If Trump looks the other way its because he's not prepared for Americans to pay $10 a gallon for gas, nor prepared to invade Saudi Arabia and take the oil.  It's a shame Democrats can't think their way out of a wet paper sack.
6151 2018-10-18 14:50:49 Looking at the weekly Oil chart I think we are into a bigger drop on oil. will do some chart work to find entry spots.

6155 2018-10-18 14:50:44 @realDonaldTrump this is an actual real moment to prove the toughness that you like to portray. Show the world by telling the #Saudis to go f themselves. Pull out of the weapons agreement and let us use our own oil or other means for fuels.
6156 2018-10-18 14:50:35 aku sih cleansing oil. biar dosa dosa terangkat dari wajah dulu
6157 2018-10-18 14:50:30 /rlt/ essential oil yg bagus selain y0ung lvng apa ya? + Dimana belinya, makasih
6158 2018-10-18 14:50:30 Yeah, you're right. U.S. imperialism was plain to see when it freed Kuwait, kept the land, stole the oil and made it the 51st state. 

Hahahaha. Grow up.
6159 2018-10-18 14:50:24 Saudi Arabia is the price setter for oil and will be in a powerful position unless we reduce our dependence on it.
6160 2018-10-18 14:50:19 As soon as this house is paid off in ND. Should take more then 5 or 6 years with the hubby working oil field  I can't wait to come home.

6162 2018-10-18 14:50:06 hemp can replace plastic: 
• it’s completely biodegradable 
• it’s an infinite resource 
• doesn’t use fossil fuels 
• BUT IT WILL NEVER BE LEGALISED WORLDWIDE BECAUSE U FOOLS MAKE TOO MUCH OFF OF EXPLOITING THE MIDDLE EAST FOR OIL
6163 2018-10-18 14:50:06 All hail the power of money especially oil money...
6164 2018-10-18 14:50:05 【ad】Few things are as versatile as our oil. "Oilmighty" can use for cooking, gear and even lubricant for your relationship!
6165 2018-10-18 14:49:54 Oil is essentially fungible and our military equipment is arguably the gold standard. SA is locked in as a customer of the latter. They need us more than we need them
6166 2018-10-18 14:49:52 not hating...but whew! these hawaii essential oil moms are doing THE MOST
6167 2018-10-18 14:49:49 A very big shout-out to all the females wey dey enter kitchen 
Has oil ever splash on you when frying fish??? 
Damn!!! I felt like killing the fish all over again 
6168 2018-10-18 14:49:49 will she work in the big oil business too?
6169 2018-10-18 14:49:44 Energy is all around us. There is enough in a cubic foot to boil all of the world's oceans. It's existence and how to access it has been hidden from us all. We do not need land or oil to produce energy. DEMAND DECLAS OF SECRET SPACE PROGRAMS.

6171 2018-10-18 14:49:34 I don't know, that's a huge question. I do know that a massive amount of recent billionaires have made their cash of purchased state assets - oil, gas, metals in Russia, telecommunication monopolies in South America,  the privitisation of state sponsored tech and science research
6172 2018-10-18 14:49:32 Coconut oil 
6173 2018-10-18 14:49:32 {Israel/Ephraim is being cleared out as a part of God's judgment. It is dealing corruptly with much deceit. They were not to make any covenants with the Assyrians, and they were trading oil into Egypt their old foe/oppressor against God's will.}
6174 2018-10-18 14:49:22 Agreed altho their ability to rapidly in/decrease oil flow has powerful effect on markets.  But we decided long ago to prefer them pissing outside the tent and pay us off when suffering the more than occasional bouts of incontinence when lounging inside.
6175 2018-10-18 14:49:19 @irvingoil with respect, what is the possibility that you can eliminate sourcing your refinery feedstock from Saudi Arabia? We understand that business and politics mix as well as water and oil, but the current situation in that country transcends both.

'OIL.'

6183 2018-10-18 14:48:42 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
6184 2018-10-18 14:48:39 ดั่ย
6185 2018-10-18 14:48:32 I thought oil and gas was bought months in advance and stored.thats what they told us last time the price per barrel fell.
6186 2018-10-18 14:48:32 me "We must transition from an Oil & War, Divide & Conquer economy."
them "Nah. We have data that shows we can keep this up for 35 more years."
me "That data is wrong."
6187 2018-10-18 14:48:24 At the moment all efforts to clean oil from these creatures using chemicals or cleansing agents have resulted in many occasions with death showing a mortality rate of approx 98% which is a horrific number .. that's without adding the damage to the enviroment ..
6188 2018-10-18 14:48:23 Yeah heat your products. Like I said putting castor oil in hot water or doing deep conditioning in the shower so there’s steam to open up your cuticles
6189 2018-10-18 14:48:23 Peanut oil is NOT used in vaccines. This it a total lie. Linking vaccines to peanut allergies is deception. #NotaDoctor
6190 2018-10-18 14:47:59 You are linking a bunch of barely related issues as though it was one single sinister plot. US embassies & 9/11 are a byproduct of America's Military Industrial Complex & Big Oil pillaging the geopolitical stage. Entities supported by politicians from both political tribes.
6191 2018-10-18 14:47:45 so @atiku is also an oil bunker

6196 2018-10-18 14:47:24 But I gotta get my oil changed first

6198 2018-10-18 14:47:16 Avocado is excellent for your hair. Stress can cause hair loss. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Is it NISIM or NHB? A shampoo to curb hair loss. or close to it. How on earth do I come across the appropriate address. No Side-effects. I remember.

6205 2018-10-18 14:46:42 FYI @DrewBarnesMLA Have your staff work with contacts as to which countries will be energy self sufficient within 5 years. Those countries won't be buying oil from us.

6207 2018-10-18 14:46:21 You tried changing the oil?
6208 2018-10-18 14:46:15 What it means is more money in their pockets. Pure and simple.
There is nothing good that will come from deregulation if oil and gas companies.
6209 2018-10-18 14:46:06 Felt like Tusk and Juncker trying very hard not to pour any more oil on the Brexit fire in that presser. But now we're all going wild over an extension of the transition period that doesn't actually address the problems with the backstop

6218 2018-10-18 14:45:11 however it's my belief these 3 are a must Now .. "One" named 'SPILLAGE RETENTION' "WILL" clean oil and fuel spilt constantly on land in our Oceans, Seas, Rivers, Lakes & Streams worldwide .. also petrol/diesel  spills without using chemicals which destroy the enviroment ..
6219 2018-10-18 14:45:11 Or maybe the world oil market is just money driven and anything and everything is a reason to raise the prices.
6220 2018-10-18 14:45:06 like literally u cannot moisturize without putting some kinda oil into ur moisturizer in this weather. at least me. shit be real af

6222 2018-10-18 14:44:47 Saudi Arabia & the US have done business together for decades, with the Saudis using oil revenue money to be an important part of their foreign relations.  A good example of this was seen in a book & movie ‘Charlie Wilson’s War’.  The Saudi’s see financially supporting the US ..2

6228 2018-10-18 14:44:07 Not very credible IMHO @patrickrooney . Can't believe the drop from 17% to 15% of foreign investments in oil & gas industry makes much of a difference in terms of correlation between oil price and CAD/USD exch. rate.
6229 2018-10-18 14:44:06 I don't think that it is a 50-50 debate on whether it exists, I think your 50-50 figure lies in the how to deal with it... the U.S. needs to burn oil to compete on the world stage in pretty much everything other countries wont stop so the us wont either
6230 2018-10-18 14:44:00 Agree, oil and gas is volatile  and everyone knows we must find alternative renewables to address climate change anyway. Focus should be on avoiding harms we know exist (seems like no brainer) then the energy world will find alternatives....

6262 2018-10-18 14:41:50 It'll go up anyways as more and more ev and natural gas vehicles hit the road. Gas and diesel are the only ones paying for the road. 
Plus oil byproduct is used to make the road. Getting rid of oil will be much more costly than is fully told.

The other 5 did not.  The lamp is to shine the light to the others on the path.  If you have no oil, you have no light.

6311 2018-10-18 14:37:45 I believe we should push to tariff foreign oil into Canada. It is the only way Canadians will realize (through their pockets) how they are not supporting the interests of their own countrymen.

6332 2018-10-18 14:36:03 There is a lot of connection. Lower oil means improving CAD which will lead to better macros and sentiments

6336 2018-10-18 14:35:51 But I’m guessing losing all that oil and gas money from so many commuters in those big cities would be frowned up by your oil rich buddies. Best to protect them, right?

The reason they've stopped making solid predictions is obvious: every single alarmist claim made thus far has proven to be wrong.
6353 2018-10-18 14:34:45 I'm sorry, that is pure denier bollocks.  300 million people in India are too remote to be connected to the grid.  Solar panels and wind generators can help these remote communities.  Making them dependent on coal/oil means you've go to build roads & make them pay $$$ for fuel

6355 2018-10-18 14:34:37 I also read an an article about saudi aramco taking over Texas' largest oil refinery on Monday. Something is up ahead of the aramco ipo, they're silencing detractors.

6358 2018-10-18 14:33:53 esp since it's barely $4 billion. All we have to do is shut off parts sales to SA, and stop buying their oil. They need us WAY more than we need them.  Can you imagine if Hillary or Joe Biden was President and them putting up with this for one second??

6402 2018-10-18 14:30:17 That makes sense. Experimenting with an oil but just from taking CBD myself, I know that absorbing into the bloodstream is better than digesting it initially. 

What kind of dose did you administer?

(also great to read that it helped!)
6403 2018-10-18 14:30:16 Unfortunately, if they do get led to the polls, their vote counts just as much as yours.
6404 2018-10-18 14:30:15 Our power isn’t oil, it is coal, nuclear, wind, and a growing amount of natural gas

Analysts at Fitch Solutions forecast that the price of Brent Crude Oil will average $91 per barrel in 2022.

6408 2018-10-18 14:29:51 Actually, Texas does great when oil prices are high.  You been hanging with trump too long , his moron is rubbing off on you.  That being said , you are lying about what Beto said.  #lyinTed
6409 2018-10-18 14:29:51 People are a bit obsessed with co2 and forget peak oil and the corruption of oil companies. Diversification, democratization and changing the market is just as important.
6410 2018-10-18 14:29:50 It is ignorant to think that is the only reason not to abandon Riyadh. The stability of the Middle East rests on this relationship, in addition to oil prices, and dollar hegemony. This is true international game theory - lots at stake
6411 2018-10-18 14:29:47 I’m getting an oil change y’all god bless America
6412 2018-10-18 14:29:42 BS! Vote yes! Renewable energy will reduce our carbon footprint and reduce our dependence on foreign oil. (Think Saudi Arabia!) Arizona has 350 days of sunshine per year- it only makes sense to include solar energy!
6413 2018-10-18 14:29:41 never imagined that when my grandma who passed visited me in my dreams she’d be asking me to send her cbd oil
6414 2018-10-18 14:29:39 Captain Coconut Oil ended the season with a team in freefall from his overmanaging -- lineup tinkering, position changes and lack of defined roles. He will never get another managing job after the Phillies finally realize Gabermetrics does not work.
6415 2018-10-18 14:29:37 and he violates the terms of his return to power in 1953. So the rise in oil prices was the only outcome for both. 

Then Kissinger went to the Saudis and said: the Shah is asking us for weapons. he might attack you.  You need weapons, but you have to pay. .... etc

6419 2018-10-18 14:29:11 I guess I just think that if the oil companies, with their very deep pockets for research, know the scientific evidence is sound enough that they're agreeing with the IPCC reports in courtrooms, it's probably pretty sound.
6420 2018-10-18 14:29:05 @ZabrenaXO Are there any pregnancy-safe skincare products for acne/oil that you used or can recommend? Pretty sure that “pregnancy glow” just means for breakouts for me . Thanks!!

6423 2018-10-18 14:28:54 Now if we could just refine the oil we have.... We haven't built a new refinery since 1977.
6424 2018-10-18 14:28:46 #Hemp protein and acne. It's rich in vitamins, minerals, essential amino acids and a nice blend of fatty acids. Its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties can help to renew and heal your skin, and it contains high levels of linoleic acid, just like your natural skin oil.
6425 2018-10-18 14:28:42 Books really connect us. During evacuation at my cousin's home for the recent hurricane, I recommended "The Thousand Autumns of Jacob De Zoet" by David Mitchell to him. So pleased to hear he's been burning the midnight oil with it. Can't wait until we meet again and discuss it.
6426 2018-10-18 14:28:39 As China India and the USA ignore the Paris Accord, good old Canada is going to destroy our oil industry. Brilliant.
6427 2018-10-18 14:28:38 Cooking oil?
6428 2018-10-18 14:28:35 It’s all about oil.
6429 2018-10-18 14:28:32 Hooo boy the depression hit hard yesterday but today I'm alright and I got new CBD oil and a vampy lipstick in the post. One day at a time, pals.
6430 2018-10-18 14:28:30 Peppermint oil is amazing for cleaning counter tops and bathroom. After you disinfect, put a few drops and wipe away. Bugs and spiders hate peppermint too so it keeps them away.
6431 2018-10-18 14:28:30 The rose oil calms down the nervous system and evokes positive emotions.
Experience Mangwanani African Wild Rose , experience happiness!

6434 2018-10-18 14:28:19 A $10 dollar-a-barrel tax on Texas oil is not good for Texas. #ChooseCruz #TXSen
6435 2018-10-18 14:28:17 The regulations of the Obama administration forced MANY small oil and gas producers like us out of business.  A $10 per barrel tax on oil would finish us off!!
6436 2018-10-18 14:28:16 yeah i agree Lyn. I cant be arsed neither...tankers. I tell ya.
6437 2018-10-18 14:28:16 Trump wants Saudi oil and Saudi wants US weapons. They won't threaten each other.
6438 2018-10-18 14:28:12 Oh no Lucas Oil!!!
6439 2018-10-18 14:28:12 Good news for India.
Not that I believe a high oil price is doom & gloom for India as projected by the doomsday prophecy makers, sentimentally it makes a big difference.
6440 2018-10-18 14:27:54 I know some will not agree with this but for me I have realistic daily goals as to how many handles I want to catch. For oil it may be 40 cents for ES it may be 5 handles. Once I reach that goal my trades become more defensive. I don’t believe in the hot hand fallacy

6445 2018-10-18 14:27:41 from an outsider looking at your political funding, it looks like the oil industry have paid off all your politicians to make stuff that does not use oil etc harder - but vs the rest of the world the USA does have low power prices ~ but how do power companies make money?
6446 2018-10-18 14:27:41 Vape cartridges, concentrated thc oil. It doesn't smell so I can sneak into the bathroom at work and take a hit or two 
6447 2018-10-18 14:27:36 Considering how much oil we burn in our cars, and the plethora of better alternatives -- electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids -- available and arriving, perhaps a price shock would help bring us to our senses and help ensure a more viable future.

His response: raise my share from oil revenues. This was none started for the companies

US response: raise oil prices. 

How?  He cannot cut production because he violates the terms of the oil concession he signed. next
6453 2018-10-18 14:27:16 I wouldn't be upset if someone launched him down a flight of stairs head first.

6468 2018-10-18 14:25:53 The #Saudi royals helped bail out the failing @realDonaldTrump in the ‘90s; they remained involved thereafter. That’s not why he’s shielding them now — it’s arms sales, oil, Saudi Investment Fund’s clout and anti-Iran maneuvering — but the history further corrodes US standing.
6469 2018-10-18 14:25:44 Folks PLEASE get your damn oil changed when it’s time. It could end up being a costly mistake

6484 2018-10-18 14:24:24 And he wants to become as rich as Putin and the Russian Oligarchs by selling off public assets like our National Parks for oil drilling, privatizing our institutions, etc. It’s Kleptocracy. It’s massive corruption. It’s fascism. It’s all about self-profiteering, deceit & fraud.

6499 2018-10-18 14:23:34 Yes. Trump's "re-invigoration" of coal and oil interests is taking us further and further from our small efforts in that regard. Another of his make-trump-wealthy schemes.
6500 2018-10-18 14:23:33 You get more oil from us than you do Saudi Arabia and we are your largest trade partner. Again your ignorance is simply astounding.
6501 2018-10-18 14:23:32 He said he get free oil changes I’m crying
6502 2018-10-18 14:23:31 Provide more incentives for domestic oil. Just stop buying from them. Period. They’ll cut off MSB’s head.

6505 2018-10-18 14:23:19 Actually my perspective is that because Saudi Arabia holds so much oil (which is of paramount importance to society today) the Saudis are practically invincible to threats of invasion or violence
6506 2018-10-18 14:23:15 Oh, so you aren't taking a side? Well, Iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism, have proclaimed death to US and Israel, threatened to close off strait of Hormuz (which would send price of oil through the roof), supports Bashir who Obama shrunk from, etc. But hey what do I know

6510 2018-10-18 14:22:48 So before dozing last night, I got up to get whiskey & a spoonful of honey for my bf’s sore throat. Come to find, I‘d left the stove on to cook the water from my cast iron skillet so I could add an oil coat. Moral: do nice things for people. It may save your life one day.

6526 2018-10-18 14:21:08 Cheap oil & war on terror should be  more important than human rights. Khashoggi was member of Al -Qaeda & Muslim brotherhood before he was 'made' journalist by the left & Washington Post. We deal with Iraq, UAE & others who are no less brutal. If they are our allies then ignore.
6527 2018-10-18 14:21:04 You may be misjudging the balance of power

Saudis (and Iran) know that any sudden outburst of morality from UK will be meat and drink to Germany, France, Italy and others...

They’ve got what we need - oil

If is panic buying on gas, so we say people are going to empty gas they hv bought and come back on the queue to get more?

Ofcource oil is still the main thing. This is not going to change quickly, but it will change. Give it 20 years and most energy is in the form of electricity.

6653 2018-10-18 14:11:17 Canada has issues getting oil to market right now. Also, it's not just what US imports - Saudis cut exports and global price rises. In addition, Saudi owns refining infrastructure in US and has term contracts regarding specific qualities of crude. This is not that simple.

6699 2018-10-18 14:07:55 yes .. Hording should have been done by Indian state too . just few days back India bought 25 billion oil deal from US with same Hoarding stock of US.

6713 2018-10-18 14:06:00 I guess you can't see how much control Israel has over the US. Look into the Israeli lobby. The media is trying to turn you against Russia because we are in a proxy war against them in the middle east for oil. Russia made a peaceful deal while we are killing people for the oil.
6714 2018-10-18 14:05:59 Not the Trump who has championed "beautiful clean coal" & sought to roll back auto emissions standards, plans drilling oil in Alaska wildlife preserve. CO2 emissions falling likely due to state and private actions. California tough. Many have installed solar panels! I have &LEDs.

6730 2018-10-18 14:04:09 Well done. I would, as I don’t think oil will fall too much farther. Maybe 77 or so and we’ll be back above 80 next week easily. Cheers to the day!
6731 2018-10-18 14:04:04 @realDonaldTrump there’s another lie blah blah “trump saturation”,  no one cares what you say, it’s all a lie, you just don’t signify. #MBS certainly manipulated that oil supply eh? 100 million oil dropping for midterms -7 minute dismembering of free speech, a bargain for you

6758 2018-10-18 14:01:14 Oily skin needs moisture. It's probably over producing oil because you keep drying it out

6833 2018-10-18 13:55:24 They do have oil and real communists. However, US is today very far from being a world police, nor is able to intervene just because.

On the other hand, Brazil might be able to intervene when the ruling communist government loses the elections later this month.
6834 2018-10-18 13:55:19 Moreover, the Saudis ‘ bark is worse than their bite. After their tiff with Canada, they neither cut off oil sales nor stopped purchases of armoured personnel carriers, part of a massive contract.

6963 2018-10-18 13:45:55 If everyone from Mexico and south America wants to move here anyway, why dont we just annex them all as territories and instead bring the US to them? Lots of oil in SA

6966 2018-10-18 13:45:45 Oil is energy -just one form of it. This video omits language on fossil fuels, which makes them look clean. It's misleading.Yes, the future should be in clean energy and these companies should lead the way. But they are still very dirty and rely on extractive, fossil fuels.

6972 2018-10-18 13:45:25 Point 2- Next OIL REFINERIES. These use Abserloutely staggering amounts of power, as much as a small town just to convert from into petrol. Far more than is needed to make batteries etc needed for EVs.
6973 2018-10-18 13:45:22 Yep but would they would have to pay if a full member etc watering.....there solution solely to protect oil and to a smaller degree fish, in a service based economy like U.K. complete folly.

6976 2018-10-18 13:45:12 He seems to be a typical, conniving snake oil salesman. Say anything for$. Evil in reality!
6977 2018-10-18 13:45:10 Point 1 - Firstly you have to transport oil both to refineries and then petrol goes in huge deisel trucks have to carry it daily to forecourts. Electrical power goes direct almost instantly from where it is made and into car.
6978 2018-10-18 13:45:10 Yup- things will settle down with the spread. I’m surprised there isn’t more oil political risk with the events in Saudi Arabia.

6980 2018-10-18 13:44:59 What brand of tea tree oil y’all use for acne scars and shit because the shit I use didn’t work at all. 
6981 2018-10-18 13:44:54 Oh and remember when the UAE were really close friends of ours until some numbnuts congressman got all pearl clutchy about them buying one of our oil refining ports?

6983 2018-10-18 13:44:37 The old-man oil mongers have been sucking on the Saudi evil for too many years. We don't need their damn oil. We don't need to be selling arms to those responsible for the 3000 dead in the twin towers. Time for a change.
6984 2018-10-18 13:44:36 Venezuela's economy was primarily screwed by price fixing on oil, which is what their economy is based on, not political ideology.  70% of the country is privately owned.
6985 2018-10-18 13:44:17 A furnace tuneup means they adjust the pump pressure to check the burn efficiency.

A probe is put into the exhaust to calibrate it.

6988 2018-10-18 13:43:53 This is all about trying to drive a wedge between us and the Saudi Government thus causing oil to skyrocket and wrecking the Trump economy.
6989 2018-10-18 13:43:52 Yeah, Claire's home made Chilli oil is mind blowing. I can't eat it, too hot for me.
6990 2018-10-18 13:43:51 Welcome to music class where we talk about dealing valve oil
6991 2018-10-18 13:43:45 Because they have a lot of money- and have been Historical allies of the USA. There are plenty of times we have let Israel slide- and they don't have any oil.

6993 2018-10-18 13:43:39 I even made a whole appointment to get my oil changed and I fucking no showed so that I could get my brows microbladed
6994 2018-10-18 13:43:36 We do not use saudi oil but we import from alot of places - we produce 8 million barrels a day we use roughly 14 to 16 million a day - we export some refined product and natural gas - the world oil market is very tight
6995 2018-10-18 13:43:31 Tryinna figure out why my express oil change just took damn near an hour . 
6996 2018-10-18 13:43:25 Oil will be the saviour and mkts will rally from the open. Don't make the mistake of shorting tomorrow
6997 2018-10-18 13:43:24 Funny how Twitter works. When I was calling for sub $70 oil at $72 and oil was creeping higher with $100 oil calls in the media, I was challenged on all my talking points. Haven't heard squat from those individuals since. Seems they've gone pretty quiet here lately.  #OOTT

7015 2018-10-18 13:41:54 Play up the CO2 and play down the methane to minimize Big Agra and Big Oil^s role and flip the script. It's how we are played.
7016 2018-10-18 13:41:51 Sorry NOT our problem you wacko dems really want us to be a thrid world country so u want 400 dollar a barrel for oil ha ha ha ha ha ha meanwhile he was NOT a US citizen meanwhile still no evidence handed over to us ha ha ha
7017 2018-10-18 13:41:47 True as we develop solar and wind energy. We've had them as an "ally" because of our dependence on oil.

Reduce oil use to levels we can self sustain and suddenly the middle east isn't so vital.
7018 2018-10-18 13:41:32 Last week I change brake disc and break pad, yesterday I change bolts and do servicing. Now AC gas don finish, oil gasket dey leak,linkage, shock front and back,thyrod etc I don tire brother
7019 2018-10-18 13:41:27 No importation of or cap on of Saudi oil...we should be independent by now.  ARCO gas is cheaper, not from Mideast. No travel by vacationers, et al....Riyadh, Mecca, etc.  Sanctions, no trade.
7020 2018-10-18 13:41:14 The Truth is that the Saudi’s are the swing producer in the Crude oil Markets - If they cut thier production in Half for a few weeks the price would explode upwards and the world economy would shudder - the price of gasoline would spike multiple dollars immediately
7021 2018-10-18 13:41:12 No. Lennox has two smoke stacks for boiler exhaust. Those are not cooling towers. Cooling towers are much bigger. Both units cooled by lake water. It is a dual fired plant (designed originally for oil but now uses gas). If you want to drop me an email I can explain. Cheers.
7022 2018-10-18 13:41:11 Let’s pump our brakes on these teacher pay increases. Are we certain that the oil & energy sectors have received their full allotment of tax breaks & kickbacks yet?

7024 2018-10-18 13:40:56 Like when you do the math, I’m paying well over $200 for oil changes throughout the year. I’d rather just pay the shit upfront and be done, not have to come back for a year. I’m over it. 
7025 2018-10-18 13:40:54 sana oil brad
7026 2018-10-18 13:40:48 Interesting but what about when you have the oil shared with the gearbox. How does that mess things up? Or not.....

7040 2018-10-18 13:39:30 The war halted all prospecting. In the 20s new oil fields were discovered in Khanaqin (23) and Kirkuk (27), both significantly further north than Basra and much later than 1914. The Br  move on Bas was not to secure new oil fields but protect the Persian holdings and naval lines.
7041 2018-10-18 13:39:30 I look so greasy with this vitamin e oil on my face 
7042 2018-10-18 13:39:29 Ok so, I want a vehicle that’s only requires an oil change ONCE a year. This whole oil change shit every three months, well for me every month and a  half is old.

7053 2018-10-18 13:38:54 Used coconut oil on my face for the first time today.. let’s see how this goes
7054 2018-10-18 13:38:54 Washington knew most middle East is barbarian gov . Steal chop of hand , cheat stone you to death . And women are property . But gov over look this for decades . As want their oil
7055 2018-10-18 13:38:48 Complicated this oil.. Looks like it is heading down to low 60s in WTI.
7056 2018-10-18 13:38:45 We should probably stop all trade and boycott middle eastern oil.  I wonder how much that virtue signal would cost?
7057 2018-10-18 13:38:40 There have been stories down through the years of wealthy sheiks who pursue hedonistic lifestyles. It's probably tolerated up to a point so long as it doesn't get out of hand. A friend of mine worked in one of the smaller oil states, it's well known that the monarch is gay.
7058 2018-10-18 13:38:39 so open your eyes were a bigger club than you'll ever be. oil money. show some respect.

7068 2018-10-18 13:37:58 Most western countries gain something from the KSA, whether it was oil or iweapons exports (like Germany). That's why I'm not very optimistic that much will change in the future.
7069 2018-10-18 13:37:57 They were busy queueing for cooking oil. So it was a war btwn protecting a jersey or getting oil.

7081 2018-10-18 13:36:26 And as former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Farkas suggested, since our own oil production has reached the level it has they are not as important to us as they used to be and picking sides, other than Israel, in that region is not often a good idea,

7093 2018-10-18 13:35:41 Canada doesn’t have the ports or refineries to get their oil to market, thus they send it to Texas and Louisiana. Without the US, Canadian oil wouldn’t see the light of the market

7108 2018-10-18 13:34:43 When you can charge your car fully in 5 minutes only then will it really hurt the oil industry
7109 2018-10-18 13:34:43 my tollerence too high but i can afford to put oil and never less than 3 grams in an L 
7110 2018-10-18 13:34:41 The UK’s principal oil concerns between 1914 and 1918 lay in modern day Iran and were controlled by the Anglo Persian oil company, in Mesopotamia they had a controlling interest in a Turkish petroleum company but no substantial discoveries were made until the 1920s. 1/2
7111 2018-10-18 13:34:40 US pols & Saudi royalty have long been friends. Saudis have mot power over Mideast oil.
7112 2018-10-18 13:34:32 Which is why Americans need to WOman-UP & charge Big Oil Big Tobacco & Big Pharma with Cooperate Terrorism! Before running back to polls BTW! Unless their all complicity in collusion with the LEGION of Demons already making a home via Body Snatching in Babylon The Great-America.
7113 2018-10-18 13:34:27 Everyone is talking about those skin care products w gold in them. Dont buy those when you can make your own. 

Go to Sears or somewhere and buy a gold chain. Get an empty glass jar fill with olive oil, the gold chain and your essential oils. I use Jasmine. Rub on your feet daily
7114 2018-10-18 13:34:17 instead of cheap n clean n abundant natural gas, you want us to import more heating oil so instead of direct piping from north american sources we get energy from shipped from conflict areas, refined in the gulf n finally to us? great =\
7115 2018-10-18 13:34:02 Ha-ha the #PuppetPM plans his second beggary jaunt to Saudi Arabia on the 23rd of October ha-ha "please supply us oil on deferred payment, please tell Islamic Development Bank to bail us out!" Ha-ha "it won't be for free.... it will mean swallowing the shit you've thrown at PMLN"
7116 2018-10-18 13:33:53 The funny thing is they can’t cause Canada does not have the refinearies nor the ports to export their oil. That is why they send it to Texas and Louisiana
7117 2018-10-18 13:33:47 Interesting! Marine noise pollution from ships & sonic exploration for oil reserves is a real problem in the ocean. I would have thought whale songs would get higher in response, but I'm not sure the frequency ranges of the songs vs the noise. Now I'm curious! Do you have a link?

7120 2018-10-18 13:33:42 I met a few JOG investors at the LSE oil conf they all thought it was on schedule. JOG can’t inform the market until officially told by the operator but it’s obvious.

7122 2018-10-18 13:33:39 The KSA will be in Russia's position soon enough when their oil is depleted. The world is moving beyond oil dependance & KSA hasn't modernized its economy like China. What does KSA make? All it does is extract oil from the ground & encourage extremism to protect its royal family.
7123 2018-10-18 13:33:35 And because of warming, scientists have reported insects are vanishing, even in warm places & they believe it’s the changes in temperatures are driving down their numbers.  Remember, scientists have no agenda other than determining the truth.  Can you say that about oil folks?

7126 2018-10-18 13:33:20 Caving in to "losing" the war on drugs , so moving the goal post. Instead they should accelerate the access to medicinal cannabis ( without the fun stuff), as CBD oil has so many good properties. But regulation favours big Pharma monopolies.
7127 2018-10-18 13:33:14 Tom Moyane deserves to be fired but he was just Zuma's flunky .. its a pity that Zuma gets off from this ..personally Id like to watch him getting his bum fried in hot oil .. medieval I know but fitting
7128 2018-10-18 13:33:13 You know Law's are made by AMU & your communist friends & most of the judiciary runs according to your thoughts and Hindus are living a class 2 life and oil money has made a Apthartid kind of living here
7129 2018-10-18 13:33:08 So they are Fake news now ? How about when they boycotted the Killing of the Yemeni Civilians by the Saudis ? Wasnt that a fake news ? Money buys everythings , but it seems this time the oil money wasnt enough , even Trumps knees are weakening to suppora its milking cow ( Saudi)

7135 2018-10-18 13:32:48 What is that oil wants to come off of everybody's hair terrible terrible situation ??
7136 2018-10-18 13:32:45 Lol. Sis ,not necessary o,you still need oil in your food no matter how minute.
7137 2018-10-18 13:32:44 Who do you think built the oil pipelines in Saudi Arabia? Sure wasn't the arabs, it was @Bechtel.
7138 2018-10-18 13:32:39 Where is Ricky’s brand of maple honey oil?  I would buy that in a heartbeat
7139 2018-10-18 13:32:36 Totally.  All of this bullshit aside, this is a foreign relations conundrum.  The US is very tied to Saudi Arabia for both their oil exports and their military support in the Middle East.  I can't say what previous admins would have done, but it would have been 100% more credible
7140 2018-10-18 13:32:30 Welding is not only performed on construction sites. The ability to weld underwater is a necessity for the growing number of ships and oil rigs around the world. The U.S. Navy set the record for deepest underwater weld in 2005, at 2,000 feet deep.

7142 2018-10-18 13:32:13 Ignorant. CANADA does not have the refining capacity to refine the oil nor the ports to export it so they send the oil to ya to be refined and exported out of Texas, we don’t need Canadian oil but you need us to refine it or your oil doesn’t see the light of the market
7143 2018-10-18 13:32:13 Well, he's a Republican, so unless it's an unborn white fetus, an oil magnate, or a gun, he likely doesn't care.
7144 2018-10-18 13:32:12 For shiny hair, mix one egg with a olive oil and apply to your hair. Leave it on for 20-30 minutes then shower.

7146 2018-10-18 13:32:10 When I fought in Desert Shield/Storm/Saber, I knew the great petroleum wars had begun in earnest. It is unfortunate that our addiction to fossil fuels may end up being the catalyst that hastens our demise as a species. That thar oil bid'ness ain't for tha faint of heart.

I hate to think of a double standard for the sake of oil and money. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @IvankaTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @FLOTUS
7151 2018-10-18 13:31:21 Also Chad, Niger, Cameroon for oil & gas, pipeline through Cameroon that World Bank said "was not feasible" but was for CHINA!  Also huge natural resource projects for metals in other parts of Africa. Congo $9.5 billion

That’s Y we’ve never done anything against Saudi Arabia no matter what they do
7158 2018-10-18 13:30:33 And there will most definitely be crying about war reparations because of the civil war I’m sure and the last hurricane we received some government funding to help rebuild, but like I said we have farms oil gas and electricity we provide to the US those are trade elements.

7161 2018-10-18 13:30:26 If you’re a #chef #pub #restaurant or #catering in #Kent we can supply oil in 25litre containers with a tap lid, and take them back for refill. @angelas_margate have their own containers that go back and forth to reduce plastic waste.

7164 2018-10-18 13:30:15 Sweden exporting 3398 MW. Windpower produces 2424 MW. Sun is shining. If we had more solar PV we would:
• export more power
• gain more €€
• emit less CO2
If we had more EVs we would:
• import less oil
• save more €€
• emit less CO2

7165 2018-10-18 13:30:14 Thanks!
7166 2018-10-18 13:30:12 As @BretStephensNYT writes today, Saudis will still pump oil and oppose Iran even if US is tough on them.
7167 2018-10-18 13:30:07 #SaudiArabia is a ruthless autocracy where women have few, if any #HumanRights & where #FreedomOfExpression is a totally alien concept: But its oil reserves means that the #West turns a blind eye to all this!
7168 2018-10-18 13:30:06 Wyoming is Proof of work mining paradise. High altitude for cooling, plenty of sunshine, wind and excess power from oil & gas that could be used to generate cheap power for mining, not to mention tax and regulatory incentices.
7169 2018-10-18 13:30:06 PS: Trump's rhetoric is more of a political snake oil.
7170 2018-10-18 13:30:05 Ang daming nangyari kay vivienne kanina hahaha, Na more rice, less drink siya. Buti si chicken oil, safe.
7171 2018-10-18 13:29:58 @PatUnleashed @WorldOfStu @marklevinshow @scrowder @DLoesch Ask yourselves: Who benefits if U.S. alienates Saudi Arabia & the Saudis raise oil prices to $200 a barrel?  Russia and Iran!!!  Turkey has become very chummy with Russia, Iran and Syria over the last 4 years...
7172 2018-10-18 13:29:42 they never put them on the market, as they wouldn't make any money selling oil,
if vehicles were getting that kind of mileage. I know about this technology, as a family member was one of the head engineers at General Motors. they were using lasers instead of spark plugs.
7173 2018-10-18 13:29:36 WA state:   Beware of big oil lies and millions of dollars trying to get us to say no to Initiative #1631.  VOTE YES to Clean Air #I1631.

“My people”, the jews, are associated with Banking, Hi-Tech, Medical, etc.
“His people”, the muslims are associated with shriaa law, oil and TERROR...
I think Jews are wining!!!

Even if we stopped consuming 100%.  Shoot every canadian in the head.  They still rely heavily on coal and oil for their lives.  The planet still succumbs.
7181 2018-10-18 13:28:51 A pal who suffers from epilepsy, GAD, and insomnia just tried CBD oil, reported near miraculous results.

7189 2018-10-18 13:28:17 'In symbol and truth is the sea-monster crushed by mortals; the divers strip themselves then put on oil, a symbol of the Anointed Christ' - St Ephrem the Syrian
7190 2018-10-18 13:28:14 Speaking the same thing in His Body, by His Spirit, there is nothing we cannot accomplish! "Oil makes ever thing run smoother"
7191 2018-10-18 13:27:50 Be the president, I deliberately don't want to tell you, if you can come up with such blueprint, you will see the miracle but the fears of so many is that you can't produce such and secondly you will be used as an instrument to make few Nigerians richer and give oil blocs to
7192 2018-10-18 13:27:43 If only they had billions of dollars & lots of oil gushers, poor, marginalized - no one cares
7193 2018-10-18 13:27:14 @realDonaldTrump @RepThomasMassie @RandPaul @SenTedCruz  Our NATO ally Turkey has been warming up to both Russia and Iran over the last 4 years, and it would benefit all three of them if we were to pick a fight with Saudi Arabia!  Russia would LOVE $200 a barrel oil, as well!!!

1. We will stabilize global crude oil prices - failed.
2. We don't know nothing about subsidy - failed.
3. We woul increase power generation to 30,000MW - failed.
4. Restructure Nigeria - failed.

7225 2018-10-18 13:25:13 Actually this is just a midterm - remember how tough everyone fought in 1982? Now THAT was more than a midterm! Economy taking,  13% interest mortgages, reverberations of the oil crisis - that was a tough time and ppl were really hurting (not just butthurt).

7227 2018-10-18 13:25:07 It is when you buy their oil, sell weapons to them, and do their bidding. Every U.S. #POTUS is required to bow to that terror nation. If it wasn't for #Mecca and the #Oil it would of been decimated.
7228 2018-10-18 13:24:59 And he is too dumb to even realize that the Saudis are cash strapped with oil prices down and have not actually made those purchases, just talked about them some time in the future. You know, the carrot to motivate the donkey!

7230 2018-10-18 13:24:51 sure, joking about mark cooking eggs at first was indeed fun though (but he’s cute bc he forgot to put oil first) but as time passes, y’all are constantly making fun of mark more to the point where it’s not really funny.... y’all already did it more than once, enough is enough
7231 2018-10-18 13:24:48 It's time we stopped depending on foreign oil. We have our own oil rigs and companies. We also need to start focusing more on alternative fuels. Solar, electric and wind power.

7236 2018-10-18 13:24:08 it’s a good point- whom amongst us has not dabbled in a little bit of corporate law to pay the bills? sometimes you find yourself needing to defend the right of an oil company to destroy a woman’s home- it happens

7238 2018-10-18 13:23:43 REALLY? knowing what the state's Railroad Commission does, or how the commission's chair — @ChristiCraddick — & her politically prominent family earn money off hundreds of oil & natural gas leases checkered across the state — part of the same industry she was elected to regulate.
7239 2018-10-18 13:23:42 These two are oil and water and could not possibly work together. The whole PCNB platform was based on Gallant's numerous failures. He just is determined to find many to blame his newest failure on - his inability to form a viable govt.

I'm not a master economist but I know we have oil as well as a ton of other natural resources that Britain does not, so I don't think the comparison holds up.

7280 2018-10-18 13:19:04 My understanding: we keep the Saudis happy because OPEC trades oil in US dollars, so every country that buys oil needs to buy dollars. If OPEC were to trade oil in euros or yuans it would be a disaster for us. That's why we will do whatever Saudi Arabia says no matter what.
7281 2018-10-18 13:19:01 From Alberta?  No need to tell me any more. A bunch of crybabies who loved the free market until oil prices collapsed.  Then run to govt to give them handouts.
7282 2018-10-18 13:19:01 Yup. If our current government was smart (hint...they aren't), we can try to get Trump to reduce Saudi oil imports and boost Canadian imports.

7305 2018-10-18 13:17:25 This is a put-up PR job poorly disguised as a news article and AC should be ashamed to run it. It lessens your credibility as a news outlet. Factually - palm oil is THE VERY WORST vegetable oil and no amount of guff from a VP of a palm oil producer will change this.

7325 2018-10-18 13:16:01 We need to shift to nuclear power to accelerate our decarbonization.  Thorium Nuclear reactors to replace oil and gas.  We need Geoengineering to buy us time with climate.  A Space based solar moderation station as ozone methane and carbon problems are in play.
7326 2018-10-18 13:15:38 That rain dance toh was in another league entirely  But what I was saying was that the rain dance was more like their andar ka hawas coming out , but the oil scene was more intimate with that love wala intensity 
7327 2018-10-18 13:15:17 If one has to consume it, then probably one should consume the mustard oil prepared at home and not use the processed one. Can't trust the companies around.
7328 2018-10-18 13:15:13 Thanks that will explain why bte and others not doing what you expected. But it may be they will still. FYI cndn crude oil index tanked early October because of US refinery maintenance which is to be completed first week November.
7329 2018-10-18 13:15:06 U might need oil or antifreeze
7330 2018-10-18 13:14:58 Considering the US is the largest oil producer right now I would think that oil should not be part of that equation. 45 is reluctant to blame SA, but it is not the oil... it is something else. #followthemoney
7331 2018-10-18 13:14:56 How can the GOP simultaneously talk about American independence and how strong we are while bowing down to the Saudis over oil and gun money?

Tell them to get fucked. Get oil from home and free trade with Canada, invest in renewables to lessen our dependence on oil in general.

7370 2018-10-18 13:11:55 Actually all anyone has to do is click on your name and see the pinned tweet praising an oil well.   Your disclaimer that what's being done isn't hurting nobody is shaded by that activity's immediate economic value to your immediate community.
7371 2018-10-18 13:11:47 Iran, Palestinians and journalists die. Long live Zionism. And we need our oil.

'What is the magic done by this government that has led to cessation of militancy, reduction of oil bunkering and pipeline vandalism?'

7397 2018-10-18 13:10:04 it's how business works... You want to spend all that time and energy making oil? You're going to save some money... You want it instantly from the store? You're going to pay more. Simple. Business.

7416 2018-10-18 13:08:24 Just an oil change and routine check up today.
7417 2018-10-18 13:08:22 If we have to deal with the vicious and evil #Saudi regime can we at least be honest about why? It seems we need their oil & money but they are not our friends.
7418 2018-10-18 13:08:20 #Aaog expect to hear oil discovery in R1/2 in next few days.
Would be surprised if no oil shows already as we approach depth.
7419 2018-10-18 13:08:18 Plenty. They won't though. The almight dollar with some added oil in it will win again. As always.

7426 2018-10-18 13:07:44 CRUDE OIL

Official crude oil price will meet the black market crude oil price:

TEN DOLLARS
7427 2018-10-18 13:07:20 This is not true.  PEOPLE can’t choose to not use gas or heat their homes.  PEOPLE can’t choose to not use oil products unless they are willing to go back to the Middle Ages - at which time the Planet was warming anyways.
7428 2018-10-18 13:07:08 Right after we created OPEC....

Oil independence is the only way forward.

7429 2018-10-18 13:07:06 I’m currently in a chess match between the temperature in my house and the money in my wallet to purchase heating oil.

What do you control?
7452 2018-10-18 13:05:08 You would think, wouldn’t you, that if you wanted to shred an oil on canvas, the best thing on which to test out your shredder would be a piece of canvas, not a print on paper that just happens to show the same thing as the canvas you hope to shred?
7453 2018-10-18 13:04:58 @LBC I understand why snake oil salesmen like farage and jrm want out super fast because they want to make big money, but why do the public who will be devastated by brexit so desperate? They have zero substantial reasons, it’s insane
7454 2018-10-18 13:04:51 Also if I’m done means moving to America at least move to Texas where you will be safe. Completely self sufficient in case of economic crash we have farms we produce our own electricity & the infrastructure of a private country we have our own oil gas & water... it’s hard to beat
7455 2018-10-18 13:04:46 Renew registration, Tires, oil change, & it sound like something dragging underneath my car  Atp throw the whole entire car AWAY
7456 2018-10-18 13:04:37 China drops the 25% tariff on crude oil and America has the strongest economy in the world right now.... #gopresgo #makeamericagreatagain #PresidentTrump

7458 2018-10-18 13:04:26 With Omega 3's some researchers claim there's more bioavailability in "krill" oil also the added benefit of astaxanthin. Has that been observed in vivo or is it unsubstantiated?

7460 2018-10-18 13:04:21 And before you say replace imported KSA barrels with our own and stop exporting so much; 1) the quality of what we produce doesn't match refinery configuration and 2) US doesn't have a national oil company and people export based on market opportunity.

7466 2018-10-18 13:03:31 I dream of the day when oil becomes redundant and then we can kick the middle eastern desert cult Kings in their nuts 
30-50 years from now?
7467 2018-10-18 13:03:27 Sana oil
7468 2018-10-18 13:03:27 Saudi Arabia = barbarians primitive cowards wrapped in dishcloth I hope your oil will dry up. Soon.
7469 2018-10-18 13:03:24 Best thing about carving pumpkins yesterday, toasting my own pumpkin seeds. Little olive oil, honey, and salt. Awesomeness.
7470 2018-10-18 13:03:17 That is US imports. Oil is a globally traded commodity. If KSA responds by cutting output, the global price rises. Including our own output, especially given US now exports roughly 2 million b/d and is tied to global market. Plus we're slapping sanctions on Iran Nov 5.

7490 2018-10-18 13:01:30 OK..Hard call. I do think the global oil market is getting tighter and that the EIA number yesterday was due to the hurricane disrupting exports. But I must admit the meltdown has been vicious.
7491 2018-10-18 13:01:29 Infarction was rare before the addition of high PUFA fraction oils, esp. soy oil, to the American diet. I agree nuts are better than these seed oils, but the AHA continues to recommend seed oils such as sunflower and canola. Again, why would the heart healthy oils be the ones...

7497 2018-10-18 13:00:53 @realDonaldTrump Please stop supporting Saudi Arabia. WE, the USA... do not NEED their oil. They killed a man because he wouldn't blindly support the KSA royals. In another country. On purpose.

7499 2018-10-18 13:00:47 Do you really think Trump and his supports care about Khashoggi? The Saudis are circulating reports that he was a Muslim Brotherhood operative.  Unfortunately, not having $200 a barrel oil and ruining the economy is more important to his supports #SweptUnderTheRug
7500 2018-10-18 13:00:46 Managed to squeeze in an oil change before heading back to the Global Human Rights Conference. Excited for today's sessions!

Grease and oil are the worst. It's best to put those in the trash.

7507 2018-10-18 13:00:11 Please stop, I enjoy reading your books so your murder would inconvenience me. Hopefully the oil age will end soon so the Saudis can get back to what they are best at, writing poems about ruins and roaming the desert in bands killing each other and being noble and honourable.
7508 2018-10-18 13:00:07 Here's just a sampling of the many hands-on STEM projects in MS Science:  6th graders are applying knowledge of matter to design oil booms that clean up vegetable oil.  (Thanks to all who sent in socks, cotton swabs, wood chips, duct tape, etc.!!)

7510 2018-10-18 12:59:58 High oil prices, 9/11, and now the murder of a US resident. Is Trump taking a political risk by doing a Giuliani for the Saudis? I don't think they're all that popular.
7511 2018-10-18 12:59:55 I disagree, because the market is neither free nor fair. The government subsidizes oil. The government subsidizes corn.  The government uses our tax dollars to bolster dangerous fracking. 
Oil prices are kept artificially low, thanks to our tax dollars.   It's corporate welfare
7512 2018-10-18 12:59:52 @AodhanORiordain whole shtick now is social injustice , yet when had an ounce of power he (and the party he backs) ran with austerity to the point of championing it.

No one is fooled by this snake oil salesman , he is only is looking out for himself.
7513 2018-10-18 12:59:45 We imported 876 thousand barrels of oil Per Day from Saudi, the U.S. and the gas you pay for has a business interest with Saudi.fool.

7596 2018-10-18 12:53:21 Best thing to do is clean it asap after cooking while the pan is still hot-ish. After every use rub it with oil, set it on a burner on low for an hour or so and let it get bone dry - this will keep up the seasoning. It sounds like it needed  reaeasoning though in the oven 
7597 2018-10-18 12:53:08 We’ve become accustomed to it, but health insurance for routine health maintenance is unusual.

If your auto/home insurance offered coverage for oil changes/lawn care, you’d reject it as a scam. It’s just another intermediary fee coming from your pocket.

Why is health different?
7598 2018-10-18 12:52:51 And oil jobs are somehow immune to this? And you're willing to bet the future of the planet on that? You haven't offered a better plan to reduce emissions; in the absence of that, the financial benefits of oil (even if they aren't dubious) mean almost nothing.

Makes sense why he’s protecting them, but I don’t agree with it. We need to take the hit and get rid of the damn Saudi oil influence and dependency.

7665 2018-10-18 12:45:27 Spot on Lyn. It’s embarrassing watching Trump brown nose the Saudi’s because he doesn’t want to lose his $100 billion arms deal with them. Plus he doesn’t want to see the price of oil increase as we know the Saudi’s control the market. The U.K. government are no better either.

7781 2018-10-18 12:35:17 Twas fresh organic salad with a olive oil and cider vinegar dressing followed by chicken bone broth soup with legumes and mixed vegetables. Yum!
7782 2018-10-18 12:35:13 Agree! You just have to put Parmesan cheese and olive oil.

7783 2018-10-18 12:35:08 An unprecedented volume of Iranian crude (22 million barrels) oil is set to arrive at China's northeast Dalian port this month and in early November before U.S. sanctions on Iran take effect from National Iranian Tanker Co (NITC)
7784 2018-10-18 12:35:02 I remember the delis. 

Time reference starts in early 80's - oil business. I remember that first Christmas, on Christmas Day was the worst cold snap in history at the time, and just after a major tropical storm, which was wild. Ice on the streets. No traffic.

7803 2018-10-18 12:33:07 Oil is a dirty business. “Let me murder anyone, who disagrees with me or you can’t have wind, water & sunlight” has never been used to compromise the morality if a nation.
7804 2018-10-18 12:32:56 Would it? And how much land would be needed to grow all the planets to feed the ever increasing human population? And how much man made fertiliser is going to be needed to grow said plants? Whichbis made from, you guessed it! OIL!!!

7809 2018-10-18 12:32:43 But Trump just said that the US now produces the most oil in the *world*. So that shouldn't be a consideration any longer.

7817 2018-10-18 12:32:02 It would be the right thing to do, but it’s OT going to happen.  The Saudis have us over an oil barrel.

Occams Razer applies
The simplest solution is usually the right one. He was murdered by a regime with a barbaric medieval belief system and lots of oil to buy it's way out of trouble.
7820 2018-10-18 12:31:52 #OIL:  ‘We don’t discount the recession risks,’ says @energyaspects. ‘This is one of the reasons we have a sharp correction in our medium-term oil prices (from $91 in 2020 to $71 in 2021).’ #OOTT #BrentOil #WTI
7821 2018-10-18 12:31:48 I need to look into that. O-6 content of mustard oil is acceptable though.
7822 2018-10-18 12:31:48 Considering the oil companies are the main target of this initiative and the initiative is attempting to shut down local refineries doesn’t that make sense?

7827 2018-10-18 12:31:28 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate

7830 2018-10-18 12:31:17 USA  and Turkey  have got Saudi Arabia by the balls with Jamal Khashoggi's murder. Really foolish of Saudi to plan a murder on foreign soil. USA can extract oil for literally free from Saudi now.
7831 2018-10-18 12:31:09 #PoliticalReporting How much accrued as oil revenue and revenue from companies income tax, value added tax, customs and excise, independent revenue of the Federal Government etc.
7832 2018-10-18 12:31:07 Will oil be discovered there?
7833 2018-10-18 12:31:04 Then stop putting fuel in your car that was refined with Saudi oil.
7834 2018-10-18 12:31:01 They are definitely barbarians,at least the government. They are also allies & that is sad. Oil is god. Petro $ is god.
7835 2018-10-18 12:31:00 Old chimneys have to withstand the weather on all sides while coping with the combustion chemicals that are released from a gas, wood, coal or oil fire.

The old mortar can crumble and joints in the brickwork need to be raked and re-pointed with fresh mortar
7836 2018-10-18 12:30:49 Except we only know what Turkey is SAYING happened to Kashoggi.  15 men dismember him on a desk?  Why did it take 15?  What kind of mess did that make?  Seems very amateurish....

7856 2018-10-18 12:27:41 Trump's stupid Iran policy has given the Saudis the ability to put Trump over a hump and oil barrel. What a dope.
7857 2018-10-18 12:27:41 VS-Saoedi-Arabië relatie is er een van 70 jaar: Thicker Than Oil, ook uitgebreide veiligheidsrelatie sinds 1945. Overwon oliecrisis 73 en kritiek op de 28 geheime onderzoekspagina’s waarin mogelijke bewijzen inzake betrokkenheid 9/11.
7858 2018-10-18 12:27:39 They've provided us with cheap oil and a dollar peg that has enabled American hegemony since the 70s. All American exceptionalism for the past 50 years is thanks to the House of Saud. Without it we'd have gone the way of the Soviet Union.
7859 2018-10-18 12:27:35 The Bush family had many ties to Saudi oil. W didn't go after them after 9-11, when he could have.
7860 2018-10-18 12:27:31 Thanks  I lightly pan fry it in coconut oil

 Me too and honestly I think Ted is not good person and other guy is right but defend oil energy becouse oy may hard his pocket too
7863 2018-10-18 12:27:12 You are so right!  They have held us for hostage with oil for years.  Drill baby drill!!!

7866 2018-10-18 12:26:56 Yes & short oil
7867 2018-10-18 12:26:48 Want to pollute?  Don’t care about citizens?  That’s why the oil companies, farmers, iron/electrical union workers are against the Initiative?  That’s your answer to my question?
7868 2018-10-18 12:26:38 HMQ and the Nipper have spent the last 2 weeks obsessing about their ears. I have spent more time faffing about with warm olive oil and Otex that I would have chosen in an ideal world. They are both pretty deaf now.
7869 2018-10-18 12:26:20 @realDonaldTrump If Trump wants to be taken seriously when he asks to increase international economic sanctions on Venezuela, he should consider reducing purchases of Venezuelan oil, instead of sending more cash to the Maduro regime.
7870 2018-10-18 12:26:03 Yes - motiva is the largest US refiner owned 100%by Saudi. The grade matters - oil is trading at $68/bbl now, canadian tar sands heavy at $20. Set that all aside. Venezuela no. Iran no. Libya iffy. Nigeria iffy.. and who gives up their non-Saudi supply so we can have it? Europe?
7871 2018-10-18 12:26:02 Turkey's top refiner, Tupras, is in talks with U.S. officials to obtain a waiver allowing it to keep buying Iranian oil after Washington reinstates sanctions on the Islamic Republic's energy sector in November, industry sources said.
7872 2018-10-18 12:25:57 It was 29° when I left this morning!!!! I decided my next oil change they're putting an automatic starter in my car. It's time.
7873 2018-10-18 12:25:32 @realDonaldTrump "If the United States took a measure that would allow the (oil) purchases to be suspended in Venezuela, there Maduro's regime has a serious financing problem." Macri added that "that position of the United States could change things definitively" in Venezuela.
7874 2018-10-18 12:25:31 Outlook for some U.S. dollar sensitive commodities would be gloomy in the fourth quarter as the greenback is expected to move higher. Oil may strive to deliver its final thrust towards a major resistance before starting a deep correction.
7875 2018-10-18 12:25:23 Yet no world leader ever challenges them. 

Sad proof that enough oil money can buy you immunity from anything. 

This 1 small murder wont change that.
7876 2018-10-18 12:24:53 The day Labour decided to hide the McCrone report was the day the union died.
Sad that scots would have shared thier oil anyway,but we did`nt get the chance,westminster decided to take 92% of it,after lying about it for 30 years
7877 2018-10-18 12:24:50 Now I see why UN is silent over the killings in Cameroon and Nigeria... You come for our oil yet you allow is to die.. How can you allow the killers to stop the killing?
7878 2018-10-18 12:24:48 So I got a coupon for my oil change shit still 80$
7879 2018-10-18 12:24:48 OIL: Oil slipped below $80 a barrel as the fourth weekly increase in U.S. crude inventories suggested ample supply, while Saudi-U.S. tension and falling Iranian exports lent support.

7886 2018-10-18 12:23:46 A reading from the book of Robertson 10:17: 

he who strikes down another shall face the wrath of God (unless he is authoritian despot who buys weapons and provides the US with money and oil..then God will turn a blind eye).  

For God loves war in his lands and hates journalists
7887 2018-10-18 12:23:44 Whats the source of the speculation Kuda? Its the gvt themselves.These are artificial shortages becuase if all things being equal, there wouldnt be present.

7894 2018-10-18 12:22:39 What happened to the calls for $100/bbl crude oil? 

Brent down 1.6 percent as of this tweet at $78.78/bbl
7895 2018-10-18 12:22:37 Canada’s energy industry is in a crisis. Oil & NG differentials are at record highs. CAN is getting 50% price for oil vs everywhere else in the world, but no sense of urgency coming from Trudeau et al (just crickets).  Shouldn’t Trudeau be making this a national priority?

7912 2018-10-18 12:20:39 Pat Robertson is so old and so irrelevant, his opinions really mean nothing.  If you’re an evangelical christian, this man is selling you a bunch of snake oil from the 1930’s. Pay no attention to him....

7920 2018-10-18 12:20:12 Apparently not worth $100 billion in arms sales. Plus we depend on their Oil. The situation is fucked. They knew they could get away with murdering him to send a message. The worlds a disgusting place.
7921 2018-10-18 12:20:10 Global headwinds, all driven by US policies, hitting even better EM credits: loose fiscal/tight monetary policies pushing: higher short/long rates & the $, lower commodity prices, higher oil prices given Iran sanctions; & hurting EM growth given trade wars & cold war with China.

7923 2018-10-18 12:19:58 Sorry madam for now without oil Nigeria cannot survive so they are still dependent on oil. The whole story about difficification is a chorus by PMB's government in practical it's not real
7924 2018-10-18 12:19:50 That's a tough sell $ & oil
7925 2018-10-18 12:19:41 Kinda has to break down - the Canadian government has shown a willingness to lose money on oil in order to maintain votes in port communities. Sacrificing $100 million a day shows we are not a petro state.
7926 2018-10-18 12:19:41 Where y’all be getting these oil changes at 
7927 2018-10-18 12:19:32 I remember when Houston's downtown recovered from being a ghost town when oil was roughly $25/bbl and before the annexations in Harris and Montgomery counties. It took a long time to recover, and those neighborhoods were gentrifying when I left.
7928 2018-10-18 12:19:29 Invade!  Oil!! 
7929 2018-10-18 12:19:22 Any economy that relies solely or mainly on a volatile commodity like oil will also suffer similar economic woes. Oil is not a guarantee for economic success! Nigeria’s increasing population also doesn’t help!Nigeria is a poor country! More people need to understand this!!!!!!!!!

7964 2018-10-18 12:16:22 If that’s true, why did the oil embargo by OPEC in the 1970s have such a huge effect on oil prices in the US? Even if you buy from a non Saudi supplier, their oil production used to greatly affect market price. They know they don’t anymore

7978 2018-10-18 12:14:47 Hi Art, this should mean the Associated Gas begins to Peak and decline as we are seeing with Unconventional tight Oil. This will put added pressure on the LNG Export market. I predict there will be Regulations preventing exports

7983 2018-10-18 12:14:20 Tbf, American foreign policy has never regarded human rights or democracy. Over the last 50 years specifically it's been all about maintaining the trade of USD-for-oil at any cost. Not saying it's right, far from it, but it's nothing unique to Trump.

8056 2018-10-18 12:07:01 Jesa bhi hun atleast cooking oil toh nahi lagata
8057 2018-10-18 12:06:55 @SecPompeo Yes, we have a lot of important relationships with the Saudis but if we have to abandon our American values to sell one more bomb or to buy one more gallon of oil, is it really worth the price. 

America is better than this.

8061 2018-10-18 12:06:32 As for what you do with it - there are lots of ways to get the oil in your system: sublingually, via capsules, vaping, edibles, etc. I'm finding most effective for my uses to take via capsules but if you might try sublingual use for migraines.

8067 2018-10-18 12:05:33 I mean you keep bringing up the oil thing and we get it. They gave you a shit ton of money to protect their interests. But geez give it a rest.
8068 2018-10-18 12:05:31 And actually those that do work for the oil industry agree with the mainstream climate science. If they’re as venal and corrupted as he thinks, why not offer a big monetary prize to bribe them to change their opinions. See how many takers he gets.
8069 2018-10-18 12:05:27 Gotta make up for the short fall on our oil that we sell for 18$ per barrel to the states. Instead of the 72$ per barrel we could get if the pipeline was built so it can go to world markets 
8070 2018-10-18 12:05:24 I bought gabriel punkin butt oil. It's all natural stuff
8071 2018-10-18 12:05:16 Or use a leave in conditioner that has water as the first ingredient and ends with Shea butter or oil. Their molecules are too big to pass thru your hair and stay on the outside, trapping the moisture where you want it! I hope that’s helpful. I’ll let you know how it goes!
8072 2018-10-18 12:05:15 I suppose the principle is to extract toxins from the body and help sleep like those detox foot pads that cost a fortune but mostly proven to be snake oil 
8073 2018-10-18 12:05:13 What are American interests in what happened to that journalist? We have for more national interest in ignoring it. The media will ignore it right after the election. The only reason they’re breathless is they want a oil or financial crisis to develop before midterms.
8074 2018-10-18 12:05:10 That makes sense - because here it seems one person is handling both.

8094 2018-10-18 12:02:54 This makes no sense. We only import 11% of our oil from Saudi Arabia. We import more oil from Canada at 40%.
BUT Saudi Arabia invests heavily I mean really invest in Silicon Valley. Majority of IT and app money is from S.A..
That is what Hester is afraid of.

8097 2018-10-18 12:02:25 Seriously. People just want to be fake mad because plenty if people give honest reviews of their products. I'm using ufo oil and good genes until I find something better for my oily skin and acne. Her line is the best

At the start of trip driver demand ₹1000 for filling up oil tank and I had given to him. After few hours he demand ₹100 as parking charges. Which I had given to him.

8140 2018-10-18 11:57:06 Saudi focuses on getting less reliant on oil, and more on globalization...so they kill a journalist who doesn’t like them, like this for the whole world to see in their own embassy in a rival country. Not buying it.

8179 2018-10-18 11:53:40 Bonds shrugging off -oil too. Tsy shorts have had an easy go of it lately; time nearing perhaps for fortitude of rate bears to be tested with pullbacks to 3% 10s & 3.25% 30s. Intuitively, should expect levered money to reduce massive short ahead of known unknown (Nov. election).

8189 2018-10-18 11:52:39 Nope. He lied about trying to leave scene of accident, lied about his own record of voting yes for tax of $10/barrel of oil, pretends to be Hispanic. He's bought & paid for by out of state people. #VetoBeto #veto #CruzCrew

If you don't take vitamin D, since the sun is disappearing you need to go get some vitamin D

Same goes for brown people, and mixed people

Get some strong D3, D2 (such as in mushrooms) won't work as well, fish oil is best, flax is ok I think?
8197 2018-10-18 11:52:04 We should have asked @OBA_MUSTAFI to give us the number of labours under Atiku and why he wouldn't employ the rejected Nitel and Airways workers to give them some respite? Atiku should explain how he was smuggling our crude oil wth the name of Intels.

8224 2018-10-18 11:48:53 Typical gnats, raise a tax and keep it for 'ourselves'. Reminds me of that selfish 'Scotland's oil' cringery! Scotland's shame! We should raise the tax and send the money to our betters in London to thank them for their continued beneficence and patience with us. #scotlandsshame
8225 2018-10-18 11:48:48 It would depend on whether the grids are interconnected at the time of the event. My view is that we should have 100% blackstart capability within Scotland and that, unfortunately and regardless of what the public want means clean coal, oil & nuclear.

8229 2018-10-18 11:48:34 Yesterday, an airline issued $10 dollar meal vouchers to passengers because engine oil issues. The was delayed almost 6 hours.
8230 2018-10-18 11:48:31 Electricity is needed (and a lot of it) to refine oil into fuel.  Apart from that. I guess it magically gets out of the wells to the refinery and into the cars tanks by itself.
8231 2018-10-18 11:48:15 @KXAN_News WITH ALL THE DEVASTATION AROUND US YOUR TOP STORY IS ON OIL???  MUST IT ALWAYS BE ABOUT RATINGS FOR KXAN????  The rain and flooding should have priority!
8232 2018-10-18 11:48:15 Yeah but if you’re at a concert and need some oil it could cost around $7 for 20 ounces.

8239 2018-10-18 11:47:21 Zinke about to talk about how outmoded oil and gas are supposedly the future, just to keep the bribes coming in
8240 2018-10-18 11:46:58 Alan Duncan, former Tory UK ambo and oil-industry veteran (and something of a liberal realist) said it best: House of Saud has us by the balls; they fall = we get House of ISIS with oil.

8242 2018-10-18 11:46:56 Bush was well known for his business links in Saudi oil.
 
The Clintons received millions in donations to their "foundation"

The Obama admin sold them fucktons of weapons and I wouldn't be surprised if he has other personal  business in Saudi.

You're being naive.
8243 2018-10-18 11:46:36 Add oil is not a Cantonese phrase but a Chinese one. In fact, Cantonese particularly prefer using the English “support” in their language, as a way of showing cultural obedience to the majesty of the previously colonizing Britain.
8244 2018-10-18 11:46:31 Facts. And the earth does constantly regenerate itself and in doing so creates more oil. There is not a finite amount of oil.

8291 2018-10-18 11:42:01 I can't read this piece to the end but one thing you should know is that there's corruption everywhere. If America decides to sanction Saudi Arabia, it will affect the global economy negatively. The Saudis has also promised to fight back by withdrawing their crude oil from MKT.
8292 2018-10-18 11:41:59 It's guaranteed to hit the CJEU at least once (and possibly several times if the Aughinish mineral oil case is anything to go by) which is why I was being a pedant. Also, I can't find the Finance Bill yet.

8294 2018-10-18 11:41:57 At capacity, the Keystone XL pipeline would carry roughly 51,750 acre feet of oil a year. Lake Mead releases 9,000,000 acre feet a year. So piping water from Canada to the Southwest is a very different proposition than piping oil. Orders of magnitude different.
8295 2018-10-18 11:41:55 How does high oil prices dismantles the liberal financiers, when I understand they formed out of the ashes of Standard Oil?
8296 2018-10-18 11:41:55 I have eschewed HRT for peri-menopausal symptoms in favour of a self-care approach through healthy diet, cutting back alcohol, taking flax seed oil & vitamin D. Plenty of exercise – walking, cycling, being outside all helps. #worldmenopauseday

8310 2018-10-18 11:40:17 The appeal court said, Judge Robert Altham's sentence on the fracking 3 was "manifestly severe" and changed it accordingly. But what lay behind his sentencing in this case ? many ask, as I do if his sentence was influenced by his familly's involvement in the gas and oil industry.

8326 2018-10-18 11:38:02 Of course it does, the people blame it's socialist gov over past 20 years, capping prices meant nobody produced unprofitable items any more, meant the whole economy ended up relying on oil which went tits up.
8327 2018-10-18 11:38:00 He already knew.  Money and Oil talk... For him to not take a stand on this barbaric murder is disgusting!  One thing he and his family should know the Saudis would do the same thing to them if they crossed them wrongly.

8337 2018-10-18 11:36:26 How is it "plenty"...... Oil price only soar when embargo was laid on Iran. Are u telling me oil was sold for $120/barrel from 1999.

Let me correct an impression.....when oil price jacked up around 2010/2011, the economic team then know it wasn't sustainable, they are not daft!!
8338 2018-10-18 11:36:21 Sounds like you should re-season the pan. Also make sure after you clean it to get your oil coating.

8345 2018-10-18 11:35:12 Good to know.  I wonder why it had to be be made public with the warriors at a time when there is a cooking oil shortage.  At the very least, it is poor PR.

8354 2018-10-18 11:34:31 I agree, but getting all to cherish it too would seem an impossible task. Trump fans for example; those to whom the phrase 'global warming' is simply a term to describe reheating yesterday's meatballs. 
I could do more though - avoiding products containing palm oil for a start.
8355 2018-10-18 11:34:29 Yeah it was Cruz again with the win.  You never answered the questions on how you plan to pay for your universal healthcare and cheap college.  Also you seem determined to ruin the oil and gas industry that is fueling job growth and energy independence from the Middle East!

We've used more crude oil since 1980 than in all of human history before 1980. 

Any system in which that takes place will see a decrease in poverty.
8383 2018-10-18 11:30:55 PMB has done quite a bit with less..we only appeared to be better because oil price was high and banks kept govt money. This is the real economy of Nigeria, recalliberatio is painful but it's time.

8404 2018-10-18 11:28:49 Biggest whiskey market is India where a free trade deal would strip unsane EU tariff. Scotland's economic situation, even with increase in oil prices, does not meet requirements. This simply proves EU breaks its own rules all the time when it wants to. Macron's renationalization!

8442 2018-10-18 11:24:01 No you are not. Western Civilization is what helped you people develop your oil industry. Before that you were just nomads with towels wrapped around your heads. Then you suppported an authoritarian monarchy that mantains costumes from the middle ages. So no you are not better.
8443 2018-10-18 11:23:57 I've found that rosehip oil works really well, apparently due to the linolenic acid in it which helps the healing process & calms any hyperpigmentation.
8444 2018-10-18 11:23:55 Bio oil. I’m using absolute collagen at the moment and it’s healed my scar on my forehead. It’s not gone but it’s getting better. It has other benefits too like hair, skin and nails and helps with joints. Tastes disgusting but I wouldn’t not use it now.

8452 2018-10-18 11:22:54 The Global Economic Meltdown in 2008 was initiated by Nancy Pelosi refusing to issue oil permits, This led to the $4 a gallon gasoline and crippled the US economy and soon after the global economy. Obamacare added insult to injury. #ObamasLegasy

8467 2018-10-18 11:21:15 Every modern US President has had to dance with the House of Saud and several of the most recent have been accused of personally benefiting from them. Oil deals. Libraries. Hotels. As easy as it might be, let’s not pretend Trump is the only one with Saudi dirt on his hands.

8470 2018-10-18 11:21:06 He knows nothing about climate change but he absolutely knows a boondoggle when he sees one. Look up Precession and the Gaia Theory to learn more.The Earth has been around for 4,600,000,000 years and has experienced innumerable climate changes. This is about oil, money and power!

8475 2018-10-18 11:20:34 For 80 years we’ve been complicit in supporting the brutal Saudi kingdom in its oppression of dissidents. Trading oil for arms that end up in the hands of terrorists, and giving the green light for war against Yemen. Why did it take so long for the sudden awakening? #freeloujain
8476 2018-10-18 11:20:34 Nigeria has never had a backup plan, we all know oil is the main source of revenue for the country

8480 2018-10-18 11:20:05 To date, the Saudis have gotten away with their belligerence and repression in no small part thanks to their oil reserves and related wealth. That’s the realist take. But international relations aren’t just about money and resources.

8481 2018-10-18 11:20:00 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
8482 2018-10-18 11:19:54 The mutton nihari from Nazeer is quite tasty, but the gravy is a Deepwater Horizon oil spill scene

8500 2018-10-18 11:18:05 You have to admit, Palm Oil does sound like a brand of sexual lubricant for single men...
8501 2018-10-18 11:18:04 Be careful with the stihl chainsaws! Mine was gripped with 10 hours of use and does not cover the warranty, for "poor lubrication", although I followed the instructions, with brand oil. They ask me 275 euros for fixing it ( I paid 635) @stihl_es #stihl @stihl_de  Nikolas @Stihl
8502 2018-10-18 11:18:03 i am not saying, giving a cash ward is not good. 1 core cash award is too much. Instead of giving this hug cash money, govt. should have taken all responsibilities of her training cost for future betterment. Sbi,Adidas,oil, builders all are promoting their business or products.
8503 2018-10-18 11:18:01 How much is the oil industry paying you to publish such tripe
8504 2018-10-18 11:17:49 All the more reason to politely challenge @ruthhayhurst There is no escaping the UK needs oil & gas for at least the next 2-3 decades. I'm interested to hear her arguments FOR Russian and Saudi oil given oil revenues helps support regimes with horrendous human rights records.

8510 2018-10-18 11:17:28 And the narrative of "plenty in 16years" should be stale by now.

PDP inherited a nation on the brink of precipice. Oil was sold for less than $20 for years under PDP. 

This govt should stop winging and get to work. The situation is worse now than PDP era. You can't justify that

Ummm..... the States sent arms for decades over to Afghanistan, practically started the terrorists they are fighting.

Are political/oil friends with a family who funds supports more of them.

Anybody forgetting 9/11 or the wars following???

8537 2018-10-18 11:14:05 If the Saudis turn the screws up on oil prices right before the mid-term elections, that could hurt the GOP. Can't be havin' that, now could we?
8538 2018-10-18 11:14:02 We would be so much better off if that oil had stayed here in US and we had lower gas pump prices.
8539 2018-10-18 11:13:55 Donnie standing up for human rights with the international community against atrocities committed by Saudi Arabia against a journalist is more important than threats of holding you hostage for oil and military arms. Show some leadership. Stand up, speak out. Condemn murder.

8587 2018-10-18 11:09:49 Saudi Arabia projects its power in four ways: (1) through the price of oil, (2) militarily, (3) though its power of foreign investment, and (4) religiously, by its control of Mecca.

Its attempt at soft power, to develop investment partners on its own soil, is failing.

8592 2018-10-18 11:09:12 Great fundamentals are the biggest driver of this movement. Oil prices are also up which is supporting the industrial sector. Keep in mind that the index was bearish for the past 3 years and has fallen more than 40% due to low oil prices and geopolitical tensions in the region.

8604 2018-10-18 11:08:08 Failed to understand how price of petroleum products would be reduced if its export is restricted because first of all crude oil is 85% imported, then after refining it is exported.
Since agri products are produced in India their availanlity may be increased by restricting export

8618 2018-10-18 11:07:10 Iran has had an attitude against us because we meddled in their internal politics and had that Shah inserted as leader.

The people of Iran are far more inclined to respond well to western influence than SA.

The only thing SA has is the money…oil.

8677 2018-10-18 11:01:20 My point is that global oil consumption went from 55mbpd in 1973 to 63mbpd in 1979, then fell to 58mbpd by 1983. That was the demand destruction.

The "depression" in your chart is a period when demand rose by about 10mbpd to about 72mbpd!
8678 2018-10-18 11:01:04 The saudi regime regularly carry out beheadings  and crucifixions on those who they dislike.

8710 2018-10-18 10:56:56 Agreed! But when you use "we" what do you mean? Also did you know according to Forbes job growth in alternative fuels has grown while the job numbers for oil\gas has gone down?
8711 2018-10-18 10:56:53 Thanks for the pics! What oil are you using?
8712 2018-10-18 10:56:50 I don't see India in 5 years back and now concept . Its basic common sense failure of political class and diplomats . stocking something which u don't have is a common sense which a shop keeper has .recently US sold its stocked oil to india .

8745 2018-10-18 10:51:25 Speaking about US sanctions on Iran & impact on oil imports from Iran @MEAIndia says we remain engaged with all stakeholders. US diplomat Brian Hook was here to get a perspective on this matter. We did convey that rising price of crude oil is a concern for India @CNBCTV18Live
8746 2018-10-18 10:51:24 I don’t think he bought oil - I think he cleared that one up with the senate.
8747 2018-10-18 10:51:19 i disagree on the last phrase.... Actually the political situaton described by the Economist to explain the oil crisis was pretty bad in middle east... unfortunaltely nothing or just little changed. 

A person can go to Dubai... for a week, and that's it, unless hiding....
8748 2018-10-18 10:51:18 I am sure you may not be aware of that cos you don’t have direct families who want to move abroad cos life isn’t any better for them there but I put it to you, how will you create such jobs when the people to do such jobs are living the country .

8779 2018-10-18 10:47:27 Thanks for the other side of the coin view, the squeakiest wheel was getting way too much oil, if you know the saying. Thanks for your contribution.
8780 2018-10-18 10:47:23 yes and people should have spoken out a very, very long time ago. But of course Saudi has been breaching all codes of decency and humanity for decades and cannot remain unaccountable, and same for those who have enabled by supplying weapons and buying their oil.
8781 2018-10-18 10:47:22 Because they can't lose the region that produce oil. It will be a chaos for them.!!
8782 2018-10-18 10:47:22 Trump has given Russia a pass........expect more. But its good for Americans pressurise Saudis n they will distort the oil market and the biggest casualty is USA....
8783 2018-10-18 10:47:14 Now Cannabis Oil is legal for human pain patients and all conditions but Doctors will only restrict themselves to MS, Nausea Chemo related and Chronic Pain Patients. we can stop euthanising dogs for pain alone now, by extending Cannabis Medicalisation to Vet Care like in Spain ..

8802 2018-10-18 10:43:37 Astana has traditionally built its economy on oil exports, which makes sense considering it has massive oil reserves.

8892 2018-10-18 10:31:23 Sorry, might be missing something here as I had to take a phone call. I found the Iraq thing a bit ludicrous - even if we assume that Iraq was a war driven by oil, that’s not the same as saying people were fighting neoliberalism

8928 2018-10-18 10:25:04 So effectively according to this gvt, people have so much money in Zimbabwe to hoad everything from cooking oil, fuel, beer, etc. When did everyone get a job and sudden increments. Let me give my simple advice, its the bond notes, everything else are symptoms. Remove bond notes

8964 2018-10-18 10:18:46 What we have in Zim is not a normal demand for cooking oil but some insatiable craze driven by speculative behaviour.

8972 2018-10-18 10:17:53 Their oil is our money's backing. That is why we are in no hurry to piss them off.
8973 2018-10-18 10:17:46 You dont understand, what caused the shortage in the first place?The underlying reason is not supply,its unjustified demand. So even at this point you were to pour cooking oil there will be hard demand as long as the mentality changes.demand and supply rules work differently here
8974 2018-10-18 10:17:39 it's legit, synth fuel has been around a while, it's just so expensive to make, as it needs more energy than making Hydrogen fuel.. who wants to pay £10 a litre for synth fuel, when Hydrogen is £5 a litre, and oil based fuel is £1.20...

9012 2018-10-18 10:13:25 Maybe instead of relying on oil for our energy source, which we will have to change anyways before 2050 (climate change), Trump can pump money into the infrastructure of this country and reduce the need for oil.

9013 2018-10-18 10:13:02 If the US tries to bring down MBS, they will diversify. KSA isn't stupid. They won't kick out US. But they will diversify spending and not help with oil keeping it at near $100-$120.

9163 2018-10-18 09:50:41 cooking oil will always run out as long people are buying hobho hobho.  some are forming cartels where they go in a group and keep going in and buying and buying and buying and then off they go to resell
9164 2018-10-18 09:50:37 Outlook for the oil is dependent on the guys who trade in the futures contracts. Guys who are long with huge exposures, it will move up and vice versa. Price is set/controlled by these traders. Of course there are supply and demand factors too but price is controlled by them.
9165 2018-10-18 09:50:35 Yep definitely a thing hon. They're horrible. Try magnesium and lavender oil massage, I did get some relief from using deep heat rub, but I think that's because I just love the way that stuff feels. Lol

9167 2018-10-18 09:50:00 The Saudis are far more powerful than you credit them. If they decide, they can push price of oil up. They also are spending $0.5trillion with the US. If they decide to partner with China instead, big change.

We are past Hubbard's Peak for Conventional oil and the Day of Reckoning for tight oil/Unconventional is coming.

Middle East is still pumping conventional oil.
So either figure this out or return to 1973 & '179.

Listen these people are being monitored /Controlled because there is cooking oil in the shop.
if you want Zimbabweans to fight bring cooking oil. 

Is this wat we hv been reduced to as a people?

9196 2018-10-18 09:45:39 Lol. Hahaha. Like as if you don't  
That's how you justify that filth? You can't even feel the difference lol. Saudis were living a sort of better life until US came to set up oil fields in Dhahran

9199 2018-10-18 09:45:19 Yeah I do something similar ever so often, but would like something that lasts longer. I did see 100% olive oil mayo in America recently but was hideously expensive. I wonder has any company considered high oleic sunflower oil as a cheaper alternative?

9206 2018-10-18 09:44:30 The hot thing is Poo-pourri. It’s an aerosol oil you spray into the bowl before you “go.” It traps gas underwater and releases a fresh scent when you flush. Weird—but it works.

Being scent-shy might be a leftover survival trait—avoiding leaving a scent for predators to track.
9207 2018-10-18 09:44:22 I criticise @narendramodi so much that he will never follow me .. despite giving him many good suggestions to him be it related to crude oil ir taxation etc ..
9208 2018-10-18 09:44:15 It is. Oil shills like you choose not to see.
9209 2018-10-18 09:44:11 Plus if we reduce imports of gas oil and coal we reduce our trade deficit. Ordinary people would have more money in their pocket which would boost the economy.

9295 2018-10-18 09:33:22 I would take the 1 million whether its USD or bond notes or bond coins or RTGS or litres of cooking oil!
9296 2018-10-18 09:33:15 This is a symptom of our economic ills , cooking oil is now more valuable keeping than that fat Rtgs/Bond balance. People are offloading their rtgs balances on goods like oil and sugar.

9301 2018-10-18 09:32:06 Also Trump defending Saudi nationals on the #KhashoggiMurder and the next day receive $100 M is a metaphor for everything wrong with this capitalist world. Oil money > democracy > morality
9302 2018-10-18 09:31:46 Is this cooking oil for real or we we dealing with some very expensive liquid gold? Why do people queue for a cholesterol inducing  liquid. Let's go back to poaching, boiling, steaming our food.

9305 2018-10-18 09:31:17 Okay, I am little confused.
I thought that since fracking increased no of earthquakes so it is not feasible hence the reliance on ksa oil still.
You are saying that even with earthquakes, it is fine and vision 2030 means less reliance on ksa.
Right?

9314 2018-10-18 09:30:15 Theyre not even banned. Yemen, who Saudi and America are destroying in the name of oil, is. Fearmongering works, even when it defies logic.

Saudi also gives the death penalty for being gay, which Trump voted in favor of at the UN.

9321 2018-10-18 09:29:02 "Oil" is the favorite word of people building online dating profiles in the U.S. states of Texas, Oklahoma, and North Dakota.
9322 2018-10-18 09:28:58 North Sea oil is down 75% hence why we have to buy. However, with the latest science reports we will be shifting to renewable as our planet is dying. Last chance for us all.

9481 2018-10-18 09:03:13 We are now dealing with dubious people. It is worth analysing what is in the oil.
9482 2018-10-18 09:03:08 Nor is it a country with 150000 unemployed and a high methadone problem.  And their oil comes out of the rock a lot cheaper than ours does,  what's ya point.

9484 2018-10-18 09:01:48 yeah, just not sure you want unintended consequences of that type or size... plus human rights. Oil feels v bad fit. I used to teach in a journalism school, and work with scientists on understanding the media - I remain unconvinced that an analogy, esp a dodge one, is useful.
9485 2018-10-18 09:01:45 I have tried CBD (hemp) oil sublingual for my pain and it does work, but unbelievably expensive for a little glass dropper.  I think that's considered "homeopathic".

9487 2018-10-18 09:01:37 Very sad. And the focus is usually on what the victims can do. Like for instance just stop bombing people on their own land for oil. Just stop that and it'll be fine mostly.

9573 2018-10-18 08:48:04 .@BarryGardiner: we must link trade policy to climate policy. 

Argued earlier that we must rethink our pattern of consumption - palm oil, paper - in light of the environmental degradation we are causing. 

How will UK trade policy affect our environment? #greenertrade

9583 2018-10-18 08:46:52 My point is people like you tend to single out one company when we are surrounded by plastic and always have been for many years and I doubt it will change until oil runs out. Glass is quite expensive to recycle I am pleased yours are I always put mine out for recycling,

9597 2018-10-18 08:45:06 but it's certainly a lot of clean energy production and export! Put another way, Canada's uranium production/exports could probably power more electric cars than gasoline cars fuelled by Canada's oil production/exports

9600 2018-10-18 08:44:28 We walk by faith and not by sight. The problem is that these days people want to attach the tangible to faith e.g The Pastor becomes God. The redemption is in the anointing oil.

9610 2018-10-18 08:42:30 If pipelines work maybe they are, but when they fail, which they do way too much, the results are disastrous. Canada’s environment and ecosystem is too important to risk it, with the UN report out its stupid to endanger it for money. I’d rather use foreign oil.

Now, 1$ = 72 & Oil Barrel is 77$ a barrel

@bsamadonhora , Dudu has had your plea and is ready to unblock you. A bottle of cooking oil is however needed for appeasement!!
9711 2018-10-18 08:26:08 I can imagine Coca Cola driving truck loads full of drinks mu stadium to donate their product or Econet giving them sim cards.There is everything wrong with this ... This is a national team bro ... vashayawo here mari amana ... flying from Europe to be given a box of cooking oil
9712 2018-10-18 08:25:57 Did they eventually find oil in the North East and how much did they borrow for the project?
9713 2018-10-18 08:25:45 money lead nation KSA. the oil advantage from KSA is an other very factor to hide the truth and no one wants the truth, the KSA rulers and their  victim goes viral and the reality also goes viral.

9740 2018-10-18 08:20:02 Global warming fits into their plan to ruin big oil and those who buy gas guzzling trucks. Obamas plan was to make fossil fuels so expensive that solar and wind power sources seemed feasible. Meanwhile the back of America would be broken and struggling. Now that's power.

9850 2018-10-18 08:04:54 The BIR is apparently issuing an ANNUAL Letters of Assessment to the big oil companies (may include other sectors too). I thought TRAIN was issued to encourage compliance and thereby do away with audits because its a source of corruption. WHAT HAPPENED???

9875 2018-10-18 08:00:09 India urgently needs to increase production of Coal and Oil & Gas by 30 to 40%. This can be achieved if private players are offered mines and oil fields through public partnership in companies like ONGC, Coal India and other PSUs.
9876 2018-10-18 08:00:07 I think the point he's trying to make (read the full quote) is that people in the communities hit hardest by austerity, by things controlled entirely by the UK politicians, were not willing to believe those same politicians over the comforting promises of the snake oil salesmen.
9877 2018-10-18 08:00:07 On the other hand, why ur country use and import oil from our country why u don’t extract from ur own land?

9884 2018-10-18 07:56:35 We can only imagine how many jobs has been taken domestic and overseas by predatory export and import practices. By exporting, it also indirectly hurts domestic economy in longer term by exposure to imported goods. One sample case is Venezuela's dependence to oil
9885 2018-10-18 07:56:31 The Saudis hold the purse strings on oil and arms this needs a complete rethink by Western governments,not much chance of that though.
9886 2018-10-18 07:56:22 I can only assume they accidentally opened a petrol line while doing the replacement of oil things, and spilled a lot.
9887 2018-10-18 07:56:22 It's why I can't bring myself to oppose fracking: even if we built enough nuclear reactors to decarbonize our electricity grid, fracked gas would be too useful a replacement for imported oil (especially for trucks and buses).
9888 2018-10-18 07:56:19 Things which are underrated 

-Oil massage by mum
-Hanging out with your friends without mobile
-Looking at childhood photographs 
-Not looking in the mirror whole day and enjoying your messy self
-Laying down under night sky
-Tight hugs
9889 2018-10-18 07:56:18 It’s more than just the money though, it’s what this Saudi Group stand for, I don’t want to go into it but.. do you really want to be associated with that? We laugh at city for the dirty oil money, this would be even worse.

9922 2018-10-18 07:50:16 The United States plans to turn up sanctions pressure on #Venezuela but sees less need to immediately target its energy sector, given sagging production from the #OPEC member's state-run #oil company, a senior U.S. administration official said on Wednesday.
9923 2018-10-18 07:50:08 The reason I stopped using olive oil and butter is because(as far as I know) they have lower boiling temperatures and "burn" sooner, which produces toxic chemicals linked to cancer. Which is it?
9924 2018-10-18 07:49:52 Seriously, a single @Warburtons crumpet could absorb a whole tub of butter. Maybe the next time there's an oil spill we could lob a six pack overboard. That should solve it

9945 2018-10-18 07:46:02 I'd be a little dubious about the silicone claim. Usually body builders use oil (Synthol) instead, which causes formation of scar tissue in the muscle, thus increasing its size.

9982 2018-10-18 07:42:00 Intel Official: Uh Mr. President intel says we are 99.99% sure the journalist in Saudi Arabia was tortured and brutally murdered.                                                President Trump: I’m more worried about my McDs order, Saudi’s got huuuge oil and journalist pick on me

9985 2018-10-18 07:41:51 Oil Prices fell, after U.S. crude stockpiles rose 6.5 million barrels, almost triple what analysts had forecast, while exports dropped.
9986 2018-10-18 07:41:27 Farmers of the world UNITE for a sustainable #hemp based economy! End our dependence on oil soaked dictatorships like Saudi Arabia!
9987 2018-10-18 07:41:21 My Great Granddaddy of many great grandchildren Abraham left me to oil wells and the city of Ur. My brother Muhammad bin Salman
9988 2018-10-18 07:41:21 Where’s your plate mate...we got roasted chiggin breats in coconut oil....experimenting wth new cooker 
9989 2018-10-18 07:41:09 They’d have to take us to the Supreme Court (they don’t have a good track record) and prove that the moratorium is not allowed because it is reserved, and it looks like as long as they’re fracking for oil at all, we’re safe from what I can see
9990 2018-10-18 07:40:46 耳が妊娠してたから骨盤矯正しなきゃね

9997 2018-10-18 07:40:03 You believe what you learnt and we believe ours. Let's us accept the borders which confirmed by UN and you know Azerbaijan rich state recently, instead of suffering  poverty why Armenia not retreat back peacefully from Nagorno Karabakh and benefit our oil pipelines?
9998 2018-10-18 07:40:00 What is the deal Mr Modi?

You have destroyed Dhara refined by promoting Fortune rice bran oil, because it is owned by Adani.

I will not tolerate this nonsense any more
9999 2018-10-18 07:39:51 "Data is more valuable than oil. 

"We don't have enough data that an investor from outside the country can drill down into and find out what is happening in entity." ~ @Ibshell1 on #TheMorningMojo with @buchionyegbule.
10000 2018-10-18 07:39:30 Okay great so don’t fry it just fresh oil? Thanks oh and equal quantities?
10001 2018-10-18 07:39:30 Sounds more likely that the Democrats want conservatives to fry the relationship with Saudi Arabia so that an oil embargo (ours, or theirs) screws the economy, which is a primary goal of Pelosi and Schumer.

10003 2018-10-18 07:39:21 De-dollarisation: When Trump became president, the USD was used in nearly 90% of international transactions. It has since dropped to about 2/3. Russia & China announced plans to use their currencies, EU wanna use the Euro to pay for Iranian oil, Pakistan has gone for Yuan...
10004 2018-10-18 07:39:14 Democracy is a code word for genocide in the US, as every nation they claim to bring democracy to can attest to. US foreign policy has become a  pseudoname for imperialist expansion, where there is oil you'll invariably find the bloody hand print of the US and death and suffering
10005 2018-10-18 07:39:09 Truth being told I don't know why we need even a dime of forex to produce oil. If you produce work with the gvt to engage farmers towana soy yedu locally. Even wheat don't know why we import. If we find a solution we have healed the economy.

10008 2018-10-18 07:38:36 Half true, agree with you over Qajar era, But NOT Pahlavi , all historic documents and Iranian experience clearly show how Iran was progressing in Pahlavi's era considering the price of oil less than 10$, I am a republican and Not a royalist

10010 2018-10-18 07:38:15 KAMPANYE NEGATIF yang dilancarkan di pasar ekspor terutama Uni Eropa, dengan tudingan minyak sawit (crude oil palm) asal Indonesia tidak ramah lingkungan menjadi tantangan berat bagi industri sawit saat ini.
