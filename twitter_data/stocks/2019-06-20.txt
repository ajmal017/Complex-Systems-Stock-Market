4 2019-06-20 23:55:16 Hahaha. I’m into investing stocks in my free time now
5 2019-06-20 23:55:10 84% of stocks are owned by the top 10%!
6 2019-06-20 23:54:35 So who do you dhink can afford stocks ?   The Lou Dobbs, Trumps, Corporations?  Not the middle class. They don't give a s*** about the market they are just trying to buy food, gas and take care of their kids..what are you doing for them? #b r ingdemsbackplease
7 2019-06-20 23:54:24 Still, the persistent relative weakness of financial stocks to me personally is still alarming. This disharmony simply too significant to me personally.
8 2019-06-20 23:53:43 How has he made America great for my Mom. He hasn’t done a thing for Social Security. All he wants is money to build a wall. Stocks don’t help people who live on SS. Don’t say it’s Congress it is also The Senate. And Trump. So help the Elderly that live on SS.
9 2019-06-20 23:53:20 @AndreaSJames I know you may be biased, but I was wanting to know what your opinion was on Goldman Sachs’ recent warning of technology stocks being overvalued.
10 2019-06-20 23:53:07 The majority of the nation do NOT hold stocks. Pandering to your rich friends isn't going to help you. #TrumpIsAFuckingMoron PR still without power, Flint MI still without fresh water, Farmers still struggling due to your idiotic trade war. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
11 2019-06-20 23:51:57 The stocks suck WTF its a seesaw. What are you talking about and no the unemployment rate will skyrocket it has already started just watch
12 2019-06-20 23:51:37 I'll probably just stick to investing in pot stocks.

I'm much more confident people will be smoking tons of weed for the next 30 years than they'll want Fernando Tatis graded rookies.

32 2019-06-20 23:46:48 Actually, the best data we had in this cycle came in December/ November of 2016/2017 
However, we had a lot of drama this time last year 
Higher Rates, Stocks were falling, government shutdown, so on the margin for existing home sales, it took down some of the monthly sales print

41 2019-06-20 23:42:06 Just bawled by eyes out at work so now I’m trying to cope by researching stocks and listening to @LilNasX new song 
42 2019-06-20 23:42:02 Perhaps the oldest version of direct indexing is simply owning one share each of the Dow 30. I see little advantage for most individuals going from 100 to 500 stocks.
43 2019-06-20 23:41:58 Is it just me or does it seem like every 8-12 years we just HAVE to escalate tensions and send in more troops? Has anyone checked Halliburton stocks lately?
44 2019-06-20 23:41:12 today on topics we aren’t going to touch at all....

......

.....STOCKS!! 

because I know nothing about them.
45 2019-06-20 23:40:47 "Over 2,000 stocks are covered in the index, of which over 1,600 are from United States corporations and over 360 are foreign listings". This is probably one cause of the outperformance in 2003-2007.  I've discovered the SP500 is virtually the top 60 companies in the index. "500"
46 2019-06-20 23:39:47 Unfortunately it’s extremely hard to be full size in two stocks and a total of 3 stocks and still watch big caps at the same time.. next time
47 2019-06-20 23:39:13 Spotted a few peeps queueing outside Uniqlo already. They'd better have enough stocks by the time I come home later.
48 2019-06-20 23:39:01 NOT THE STOCKS!!! Won't somebody think of the stocks?
49 2019-06-20 23:37:04 Yeah unemployment is low & the stock market is high. But sky high stocks benefit only the top 10% of wealthy Americans who own 84% of stocks. And while more people r employed now than during the Great Recession, the vast majority of Americans haven’t had a real raise since 1979.
50 2019-06-20 23:36:49 Gld will be big. Paper gld will disappear and gold will 20x. + gld is tangible. I would go 70 btc 10 gld 10 chinese stocks 10 real estate
51 2019-06-20 23:36:41 Direct indexing has a bright future. It can be done with as few as 20-100 stocks, sometimes plus a bond ladder. Some taxable "exit strategies" include:
1. Timing small sales as you would IRA withdrawals
2. Selective gifting
3. Dying and maximizing the step-ups in basis

53 2019-06-20 23:36:23 Maybe he should sell a few of his houses and cars and stocks and shares etc etc first ?
54 2019-06-20 23:34:32 Or Trump let them call their financial advisers, and they all short sold their defense technology stocks.
55 2019-06-20 23:33:42 Need to stock up on $BBM $BBRRF at these prices too. I wish I could Supermarket Sweep all of these cheap Weed stocks into my shopping cart.
56 2019-06-20 23:33:27 22.4 k like this tweet. They don’t own stocks.
57 2019-06-20 23:33:26 Does anyone know of a site/eBay seller that stocks Arabic releases of games? I know MEC has an Arabic cover variant (Arabic on the back, front is the same other than rating), would like to get my hands on a copy but cannot find anywhere selling it/dont know what to search.
58 2019-06-20 23:32:41 The bubble of stocks buybacks during a recession...do you think that bubble could have a happy end?
59 2019-06-20 23:32:37 Everything i do is dollars and cents.... I have been around enough wealthy people to understand they all got stocks and actually value they change. Every cent can turn into a dollar.. We are raised money comes and goes... When we should think money is here to grow
60 2019-06-20 23:32:24 Does anyone think that a traditional diversified portfolio (stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, REITs, etc.) can outperform buying and holding *only* Bitcoin over the next 25 years?

If so, why?
61 2019-06-20 23:31:19 I am 100% invested in stocks and I put more money to work today.

66 2019-06-20 23:29:46 $MLNT, best opportunity since $MBIO! Just amazing agenda which wasn’t easily found in the fillings.(compared to most stocks we research).
67 2019-06-20 23:29:01 So what most Americans don't own stocks.
68 2019-06-20 23:27:51 Market doesn't say anything. If machine is buying and stocks go up, it's a good machine. Machines that sell didn't perform well for the last 10 years, and switched off long ago.
69 2019-06-20 23:27:44 Bah! To the stocks wi'yer!
70 2019-06-20 23:27:10 On an annualized basis, stocks have returned just 1.8% during the last 17 months—roughly equal to inflation, for no real gain at all.
71 2019-06-20 23:27:10 It's weird thet you haven't ever made a comment, when the stocks took a dump, because of your dumb moves... classic deflection & unaccountability.
72 2019-06-20 23:26:33 Thanks for the koch brothers pov. Now shut up and report on stocks

74 2019-06-20 23:26:11 Would you say one of the differences between pullbacks in currencies vs stocks is the latter make smaller pullbacks than FX? Meaning pullbacks on FX go further into the impulse leg?
75 2019-06-20 23:25:44 I must be on the wrong side of the dollar bc my stocks are NOT up 50%
76 2019-06-20 23:24:09 Pro tip: Don’t be a “day trader”FX, Crypto, penny stocks etc
I’m telling you right now - you won’t make much $$ that way. Just wasting your time.

77 2019-06-20 23:22:36 Yes it is. In an ideal world his next public appearance would be in the stocks.
78 2019-06-20 23:21:57 You realize @FsdPharma will not be around by end of this year. Don't you do any research before investing??? This FSD is a shell company (common knowledge). #stocks #marijuana #Ontario
79 2019-06-20 23:20:39 nobody said stocks are the answer. financial education is. then saving, then smart investments ( anywhere)
80 2019-06-20 23:20:35 would the OTC be better if Robinhood allowed trading of OTC stocks?
81 2019-06-20 23:20:29 Lesley how about your stocks? Let’s play a game where you Don’t cherry pick statistics. I’m personally crushing that return. What can capitalism do for you?
82 2019-06-20 23:19:15 So to sum it up, Dollar just touched 200MA and a support for last 10 yrs, Gold broke its 6yr trend with massive OB, Silver stopped exactly at the trendline since 2009, Bonds Overbought and stocks at ATH. Only cheap asset out there seems to be Vol. Grt.
83 2019-06-20 23:18:16 Good question... It seems like stocks of older sets could be harder to come by, so supply and demand goes into effect. But I think what we're seeing now isn't necessarily indicative that it's intentionally happening, and it could correct itself in the future. We'll see!
84 2019-06-20 23:17:08 recipe i don’t care for stocks
85 2019-06-20 23:16:21 TDS stage 2: stock market goes down because Trump is stupid and ruining the economy. Stock market goes up it doesn’t matter because people don’t own stocks. There needs to be a medication for this.

87 2019-06-20 23:15:34 Leo los comentarios y veo como quemaste neuronas ademas de todos los stocks...que tristeza.
88 2019-06-20 23:14:24 Just look at a stock chart.  The S & P started roaring in 2009 and paused for the past year.  Stocks did far better per year under Obama, it’s a fact.
89 2019-06-20 23:14:01 Maybe theoretical market. But in reality, all pro teams in TB have historically been laughing stocks in their leagues except for the Lightening in ‘04 and ‘19 and really have no fan base outside of the 25 regulars at their games.
90 2019-06-20 23:13:11 Finally some good news... Let’s pray YG stocks recover because Blackpink and all their label mates are at risk  @ygofficialblink #BLACKPINK
91 2019-06-20 23:12:49 What may be happening is the big bucks are slowly coming out of stocks and going into gold and possibly bitcoin while fomo crowd 
is hitting stocks
92 2019-06-20 23:12:42 Nice try. Stop with your ridiculous qualifications of what constitutes a war. Do you own a lot of defense stocks
93 2019-06-20 23:11:49 Should they stop buying? I'm just not sure why people just think stocks should go down on a whim and not stop.
94 2019-06-20 23:10:09 Wait until your hairdresser, your taxi driver and uncle start buying stocks. Thats when you know. Case in point, the roaring 20's with those libertt bonds xD
95 2019-06-20 23:08:42 We’re finally back to where we were last September.  It’s been a bad year for stocks thanks to your idiotic trade war which we are losing!
96 2019-06-20 23:07:38 Now that it's public the world will know WH council are laughing stocks.
97 2019-06-20 23:07:35 Counting gains before you became President is cheating....eh, what else is new?  Stocks went up MORE under Obama anyways. More jobs created in Obama's last 28 months than in your 1st 28 months. ZERO stock market gains in 2018.  ZERO.
98 2019-06-20 23:06:49 @NRA ohh they don't care. Donnie the conman could say he's decided to revoke the second amendment and they will still support him. Because he's their guy. Bump stocks, suppressors, grabbing guns first, due process later, red flag laws all of that means nothing to them
99 2019-06-20 23:06:35 Yeah a nigga was telling me investing in big companies not going get you that good of a return because the stocks a lor expensive and they already known companies
100 2019-06-20 23:06:04 Time to buy war stocks and make some money!!!!
101 2019-06-20 23:05:57 Yeah.... cuz soooo many of your followers have stocks!
102 2019-06-20 23:05:13 OH NO NOT STOCKS
103 2019-06-20 23:04:10 Gold stocks went up about 3.76 percent approximately. Metal went up about 3.19 percent.
104 2019-06-20 23:02:36 this just in: slugs are popular! stocks are up. buy now!!
105 2019-06-20 23:02:21 How many in your cult own stocks?
106 2019-06-20 23:02:02 most likely stock market junkies.  Only 21% own stocks; directly or indirectly (retirement 401 K).
107 2019-06-20 23:01:58 I've gotten so addicted to investing in penny stocks. It's so dangerous but hopefully with risk comes reward.
108 2019-06-20 23:01:55 No. Didn’t mean it like that. Usually with penny stocks 1 is on either side. No middle ground. Was not accusing you. I should have kept my mouth shut minded my own business. Sorry.
109 2019-06-20 23:01:16 Sure I do, but the stocks are greater now thanks to trump. Thanks to trump I eat steak every night now. It’s a dream come true
110 2019-06-20 23:01:06 Corporations, after gorging on their own stocks, will be the  Uuge Bag holders in the next Bear Market.
111 2019-06-20 23:00:48 You do realize that there are a lot of people who don’t have stocks, right?
112 2019-06-20 23:00:30 *business man voice* time to check the stocks* and trades** , , Broken Social Scene.
113 2019-06-20 23:00:18 Also terrible for factor strategies if have any rebalancing baked in  —although consistent with my research with Prof Siegel that if bought+ held the original 500 stocks in S&P500 1957 & *never* sold any of them—would have done better than actual S&P 500 from 57-03. 
114 2019-06-20 23:00:13 hi i'm here to rant about why I hate young link because at the start of the match I was at 100% and he was at 0 so I purposely SD'd all 3 stocks so yeah someone please brutaly murder young link k cool thx dahfhwuiahfirueifgqkafkasjkfdjka
115 2019-06-20 22:58:33 Makes you wonder how much of the oil industry you have stocks in?
116 2019-06-20 22:58:12 I own personal stocks and 401k. You think only rich people own stocks? Wrong, only SMART people invest wisely
117 2019-06-20 22:56:44 What happened to stocks directly thereafter?
118 2019-06-20 22:56:29 I’m middle class. I have stocks, bonds, 403B, college funds for the kids, crypto and multiple savings account. Maybe you need to take a step back and reassess your earnings vs spendings. A start might be not paying for a smartphone and data plan if you can barely afford food.
119 2019-06-20 22:56:01 The stocks for Right Guard, Old Spice and Gillette just tanked 
120 2019-06-20 22:55:55 Hahaha they spelled stocks wrong
121 2019-06-20 22:55:14 Nice some rich people just got richer only 50% of the country owns stocks
122 2019-06-20 22:54:10 Ouais en plus Romain m’a dit qu’il avait le mort pck elle vous a fait retourner vos stocks 
123 2019-06-20 22:54:01 A quick search reveals the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans hold 84 percent of stocks by value. the s&p is not a complete indicator of economic health, and the stock market is predominantly making the rich richer.
124 2019-06-20 22:52:34 In a few years, I’ll be able to break down stocks and investing to the point everybody will be able to understand it. #Stoppingtheconfusion
125 2019-06-20 22:51:42 @marketcall I’m a bit of a skeptic about technical analysis. Is there an area where it clearly outperforms? Say with stocks like Shopify where they trade less on fundamentals?
126 2019-06-20 22:50:53  Check $PBA that set all-time highs. #stocks
127 2019-06-20 22:50:10 S+P was higher on dovish Fed interest rate news (dollar down-stocks up) but he wouldn’t know that or he’d be thanking the Fed, which he hasn’t done. So in effect, stay tuned, tomorrow is another potentially disaster/great day, but either way it likely won’t be boring!
128 2019-06-20 22:50:09 Its funny to hear alot of bulls out saying the sentiment is bearish but when you look at Put/Call options for both indexes and stocks they are telling u a different story because it is so bulled out. option buyers are usually 90% wrong so we will see.
129 2019-06-20 22:49:59 Just realized...legislators want to prevent  iPhone/iPad repairs  because of dangerous battery issues but won’t do jack about guns, bump stocks and AR 15’s or automatic assault rifles. So much hypocrisy!!! A little battery or a big damn gun!? They chose to outlaw repairs
130 2019-06-20 22:49:42 Buy stocks in defense industries while things with Iran heat up.
131 2019-06-20 22:49:23 Even the  dormant mining stocks are showing a semblance of a pulse lol
132 2019-06-20 22:49:20 The S&P 500 just hit new highs today. This country literally prints money inside buildings across America. We will NEVER default because of this. WE HAVE MONEY. It just goes into pumping their stocks and bonuses...get it?
133 2019-06-20 22:49:01 Something's got to pop and my money's on the stocks (or more accurately not on the stocks). There is no wealth being created, just share buybacks from almost free debt.
134 2019-06-20 22:48:31 On an annualized basis, stocks have returned just 1.8% during the last 17 months—roughly equal to inflation, for no real gain at all.
135 2019-06-20 22:48:03 So I guess @SEC_Enforcement should check to see if your family bought any stocks on the S&P yesterday?
136 2019-06-20 22:47:56 Totally agree.....he's probably bored and he wants to see what playing war is all about....he already invested in all the guns and ammo stocks....now to just sit back and rake in the dough while our kids get killed....
137 2019-06-20 22:47:40 On an annualized basis, stocks have returned just 1.8% during the last 17 months—roughly equal to inflation, for no real gain at all.
138 2019-06-20 22:47:37 That’s great for some Donny...but many Americans that doesn’t mean anything. Many don’t have 401k, IRA, stocks, pensions, or savings. You don’t have any idea how most Americans live. Many paycheck to paycheck.
139 2019-06-20 22:47:05 Stocks went up under Clinton and then crashed under Bush W. Later they started going up under Obama. There actually is a pattern to it, and the pattern follows Republican administrations. Don't expect the stocks to stay up for much longer. History and Republicans will repeat.
140 2019-06-20 22:46:47 furries checking their fucking Twitter analytics like “Aw man, my Lucario yiff went down by 4.4% in popularity, and my Renamon Stocks and Bondage has still been on the decline, :(“
141 2019-06-20 22:45:40 Lead and brass stocks going up?
142 2019-06-20 22:45:05 I recommend if you trying to get started with investing and you at least 40 and understand.. that you do stocks and play a lil bit with forex.. cuz you can get good dividend checks with in a year or two depending on how much you putting in
143 2019-06-20 22:43:28 What percentage of your supporters own stocks?
144 2019-06-20 22:43:07 Are right i see everybody leaning towards forex!! Are right forex ain’t hard dont get me wrong but it is more complicated to understand then stocks.. unless you got people telling you to sell or buy.. it took me damn near 4 months no help.. and i still fuck up
145 2019-06-20 22:42:56 A world where bonds, staples, gold and SaaS stocks all go up at the same time makes perfect sense
146 2019-06-20 22:42:54 But if they invested that $400 a year ago and went expense-free they'd have about $420 now, so clearly stocks are the answer.
147 2019-06-20 22:42:50 And? Half the US population owns no stocks.
148 2019-06-20 22:42:40 Because you made your rich cronies richer! The stocks mean nothing to people living paycheck to paycheck.
149 2019-06-20 22:42:36 Stocks are through the roof! Our 401K is in Full Recovery!
150 2019-06-20 22:42:16 He almost is... about 5 stocks are capable of moving the SPY, don't they?
151 2019-06-20 22:42:16 الله يبشرك بخير متعلق بالسهم وودي بالمخلاص منه
152 2019-06-20 22:41:56 I bet 95% of the people liking this tweet don’t even own any stocks. But yay rich people getting richer!!
153 2019-06-20 22:41:38 Even fox business can bitch about why the stocks are so high.. I’m done
154 2019-06-20 22:41:09 Who cares!?? Only those that are wealthy and have stocks.
155 2019-06-20 22:40:53 From the 16 #stocks in finance sector that yesterday made all-time highs, picked these:
$SPGI, $BX, $AXP, $AON, $ICE
156 2019-06-20 22:40:36 (stocks up on insulin)
157 2019-06-20 22:39:27 Asia Stocks Seen Mixed With S&P 500 at Record High. #MarketsWrap
158 2019-06-20 22:38:09 Drop all Tesla stocks...
159 2019-06-20 22:37:58 I own absolutely no stocks ,I think this is a Ponzi scheme with a bad ending
160 2019-06-20 22:37:07 As always...but if you compare a broad index of European stocks to the 500 you get a similar multi-decades of under performance.
161 2019-06-20 22:37:05 Trump Stocks
162 2019-06-20 22:37:04 These #sugarbabies are #shortsighted af.. If they were #smart they'd be #investing the #money get or telling their #daddy / #papi to gift them #stocks, #options, and/or #indexfunds
163 2019-06-20 22:37:02 Question, is 3 or 4 weeks tight in 1yr ipo's just as good as older stocks? Thank you for all your good work!
164 2019-06-20 22:36:20 Vroomvroooom
165 2019-06-20 22:35:33 Everything you just said in that last tweet reeks of stock promotion and fraud. There are no waves or rush of people playing penny stocks it’s all bullshit you’re being played or your part of the scam
166 2019-06-20 22:35:11 الحكم هذا من صالح سهم الخليجي ؟؟  او العكس
167 2019-06-20 22:34:16 $TDG --  Lots of continued breakout and follow-thru activity today on our watch list stocks, TransDigm up $23.47 in just the last three days.
168 2019-06-20 22:33:00 That makes 20 percent of rich white folks who own 80 percent of all stocks very happy.
169 2019-06-20 22:31:54 that aco taco moment when your mom walks in on you putting 75% of your paycheck into your robin hood stocks portfolio. mom, im gonna have to ask you to leave. there are things happening at a corporate level right now.
170 2019-06-20 22:31:45 What i really love to do is stock trading kaya naman i dig deeper pa about the topic. Lately i have series of winning stocks because i sold my losing stocks and reinvested immediately.
171 2019-06-20 22:31:38 Heard it on my way home on NPR.  Stocks closed higher today. No big deal from them. If it happened under Barry’s watch 
172 2019-06-20 22:31:36 he taught the stocks would fall down if hanbin's stayed in yg amidst of his issue. too bad for him its opposite
173 2019-06-20 22:31:21 Have 500+ stocks holding from more than a Year...avg 4.xx hope it goes up soon
174 2019-06-20 22:30:58 @sniperpodcast @Jaytanoo I don’t care if my oil stocks were contained as these Millennial HF PMs refused to buy/cover even as crude implied a bigger move. As long as $BYND gets crushed - there is justice in this world. Take that you vegan snot nosed cucks $BYND puts payeth
175 2019-06-20 22:30:30 I'm still holding all the growth stocks, just fewer shares until rates fall. Then, I'll sell my USTs and add to my stocks.
176 2019-06-20 22:30:20 If you want to talk stocks over a nice dinner, im always available. You pay of course
177 2019-06-20 22:29:56 Thank you for making stocks great again. MSGA
178 2019-06-20 22:29:49 Wow great! If it was possible I would have bought some ripple stocks
179 2019-06-20 22:29:00 #Bitcoin bull market

#Gold breaking out

#Stocks at record highs

$12T+ of negative yielding debt

Central Banks missed an entire business cycle & everyone's acting like everything's fine? 

'It's all just gunna keep going up'

Is this misplaced complacency a blow off top? 
180 2019-06-20 22:28:53 My stocks are going up! Thank you President Trump!
181 2019-06-20 22:28:49 Who‘s all holding stocks? Not many. And all this nice economy goes to @BarackObama as he pulled the right triggers for that what you now earn! Your chaos you do everyday will hit you hard soonest! All this trade wars will take into account! Your absolutely #UnfitToBePresident
182 2019-06-20 22:28:15 Cool . Thnx ! Good luck with the future value of stocks!
183 2019-06-20 22:28:04 Uber and Lyft time to pay up and short the stocks.
184 2019-06-20 22:27:42 its only ever the captain falcon mains that play honorably, give you homie stocks & compliment you after losing to you
185 2019-06-20 22:27:03 Who the hell cares? Normal Americans don’t know anything about stocks, that’s for the rich to get richer!
186 2019-06-20 22:27:03 So.... My partner and I tripled fly stocks today and I think the whole lab is gonna be shocked/ scared at the amount of flies we’ve flipped today alone
187 2019-06-20 22:27:00 Depends on which European stocks, no?
188 2019-06-20 22:26:52 To slightly change subjects, do you believe there should be restrictions on foreign investors in DRC, Jean? So, for example, they should be able to buy any asset (stocks, equity, land, real estate, mineral concessions, etc) w/o a local partner? Just curious...
189 2019-06-20 22:26:52 I changed this habit by getting my mom into trading on RH. Now we just text all day about tech stocks. 
190 2019-06-20 22:26:50 My stocks are ridiculous! Love my @POTUS !
191 2019-06-20 22:26:45 Odd. 2018 was the worst year for stocks in a decade. The deficit is exploding. Farms are going bankrupt twice as fast under Trump. Unemployment went from 9.8% to 4.8% under Obama. 
But you'll support Trump inspite of data cos you're racist and too stubborn to admit wrong.
192 2019-06-20 22:26:24 War with Iran. His stocks in military companies is about to sky rocket
193 2019-06-20 22:26:11 Payin myself out on these stocks to smack the fuxk out my credit card debt

195 2019-06-20 22:25:04 Stocks and slugs
196 2019-06-20 22:24:49 Can you buy me stocks?
197 2019-06-20 22:24:43 Too bad your supporters can't afford to buy stocks.
198 2019-06-20 22:24:40 It's in their DNA or they own lots of stocks in the arms industry !!! "Time to Make Money"they say.

201 2019-06-20 22:22:56 Odd. 2018 was the worst year for stocks in a decade. The deficit is exploding. Farms are going bankrupt twice as fast under Trump. Unemployment went from 9.8% to 4.8% under Obama. 
But you'll support Trump inspite of data cos you're intolerant and too stubborn to admit wrong.
202 2019-06-20 22:22:37 I would give 45,000 to a Charity and 3,000 in stocks. Then the rest I would help fund my career of choice.
203 2019-06-20 22:22:25 Certains stocks partent toujours un peu avant, difficile de tout contrôler ^^
204 2019-06-20 22:21:24 Same playbook as PHUN and ORGO...the warrants never bought the move...look where those stocks are now
205 2019-06-20 22:21:16 Arrest all illegals. Liberals blatenly ignore the laws on our borders. Did i want to vote for the bum in the w.h.? Nope. But will never vote for libtards. If mickey mouse ran against clinton he would have had my vote. The admin, congress, judges, your laughing stocks.
206 2019-06-20 22:21:01 True my stocks has raised
207 2019-06-20 22:20:24 You can pay off your debts. Just sell off some of your stocks or cut down on your Fabergé egg habit!
208 2019-06-20 22:19:51 Tesla stocks are steadily declining as elon musk never learns that shit memes don't keep the lights on
209 2019-06-20 22:18:22 BTW, if someone responds by saying, but, but, X% of the S&P 500 and Y% of the Nasdaq 100 are above their 200-day averages, they clearly don't understand what *participation* is. It's like being at the '73 top and saying, "but 40 stocks out of the Nifty Fifty are in uptrends!"
210 2019-06-20 22:17:41 Right. Bum ass. You’re literally better off investing in penny stocks
211 2019-06-20 22:16:09 But what will that do to garlic stocks? Could we end up running out of garlic?
212 2019-06-20 22:15:53 From the 21 #stocks in technology sector that yesterday marked all-time highs, picked these:
$MSFT, $ORCL, $SAP, $ADP, $ADBE
213 2019-06-20 22:15:15 Time to study level 3 #stocks
214 2019-06-20 22:14:44 If there were a shit in the stocks and having to spell the word Press on it.
215 2019-06-20 22:14:18 In a similar vein check European stocks. Tough to pull the trigger on oil stocks heading into a recession...
216 2019-06-20 22:14:11 @cvpayne How badly will stocks fall after trade talks break down again? Or when Trump threatened additional deeper taxes / tariffs in response..hey I lovethis week but if you don't take $$ off in anticipation you'd have to be crazy..

221 2019-06-20 22:13:22 My department keeps buying from the local supermarket that stocks rotted broccoli and I can't believe we keep getting punked like that.
222 2019-06-20 22:12:49 I take a basket approach with ~10 lithium stocks, big, medium & small cap. Last 12 months have been ugly across the board. Surprised many. $AJM’s SC6 is well received by the market. They will be reliable supplier. IMO, trading ~replacement value. Someone just bot 12%. DYOR

226 2019-06-20 22:09:51 Crazy that CNBC could give such a one sided report on $bynd Beyond Burgers that tanks the stock. Down 8.5 or 5% after hours to $156.90. No mention of zero cholesterol and elimination of unhealthy effects of red meat. No one there to defend! #beyondmeat #cnbc #marketwatch #stocks
227 2019-06-20 22:09:23 Look at their growth in stocks previous to 15' and post. Numbers dont lie. You knowww dis.
228 2019-06-20 22:08:27 The only real positive surprise left is Imminent Iran peace summit.
But, its not like there's some pile of sideline money that's been explicitly waiting for trump to like iran, before buying stocks.
All it will do is crash oil. $SPX bearish

231 2019-06-20 22:06:23 About 3 hours of teams friendlies with Prog, @sheridactyls and some random fox. Probably 2-5 am At BH6

The next day @johnny_S2J took a billion stocks to win crews for socal and that was dope too
232 2019-06-20 22:05:21 I make a good amount of money off sub penny stocks. Just numbers changing.
233 2019-06-20 22:05:15 Stocks ATH. TLT and Bonds are green. Gold and Silver up. Bitcoin is soaring. Oil high. 
I have no clue what that means. Sending mixed signals like.. 
@RampCapitalLLC??
234 2019-06-20 22:04:01 I’m rec fisherman, certainly share your concern about salmon sticks. But tankers are not the reason stocks are low. the issue is food, specifically herring. They need to be shutting the herring fisheries down. More food = more  = more 
235 2019-06-20 22:03:46 Soon we will find out who is true ( Gold ) who is liyng ( Stocks )..
236 2019-06-20 22:03:20 This is what Putin chants too.
It also plays on a much older Russian tradition, of ordinary people petitioning the tsar to solve their problems.
You're an idiot.
Look at what a mess things are. Stocks don't make living easier for hard working American's
237 2019-06-20 22:02:46 4) imo this company is a joke. I dont care who you think is attached maybe they will be/are being scammed. Many penny stocks dupe doctors and such. Speculative? You might as well by lottery tickets. This company has scam written all over it. Stock washing, paid promotions.
238 2019-06-20 22:02:37 Agreed - it’s all about risk management of positions. I’m confident the macro is right but that doesn’t mean #stocks will respond

242 2019-06-20 22:01:53 I would probably buy a truck load of gfuel for all my homies and than do some investing into some stocks and make bank from there
243 2019-06-20 22:01:47 I just started too and I'm not even finding it funny at all. The only thing I'm hearing is stocks and shares and I can't relate. If not that there's a scarcity of series I won't even bother. I'll drop it the moment I find something better.

252 2019-06-20 21:55:12 Stick with stocks please
253 2019-06-20 21:54:46 Investors are overrating the market’s downside potential and are too focused on what can go wrong instead of considering all that can go right with regard to stocks.
254 2019-06-20 21:54:26 Y acá sólo subo parte de lo que miro para AT. Casi siempre los charts son más complejos y los timeframes son de minutos pero tampoco busco que la gente piense que esto es mucho más complejo que lo que se ve. Y penny stocks no subo porque no es sano para el trader average.

256 2019-06-20 21:53:57 Certainly don't see it as bad. Its made me both look at stocks I might otherwise have discounted as well as revisit my investment thesis on stocks I have (or had on ). If you take the time to build a list of "trusted" peeps its certainly worth while.

274 2019-06-20 21:46:55 Global stocks rallied on the back of cheaper money as the Fed indicated a rate cut is on the cards. Gold was a big beneficiary jumping $40 in Asia and holding firm for the rest of the day as markets reposition themselves further.
275 2019-06-20 21:45:44 If some of Twiiter readers think about to making good money on the Stock Market, I urge  to follow Marijuana  and technology stocks. Of course, check with broker stock broker and don't forget to look at their respective financial statements. Good luck!

Besides, low Salmon stocks are due to, lack of hatchery programs, habitat loss/restoration, herring populations, overfishing. Not oil.
277 2019-06-20 21:45:35 Global stocks rallied on the back of cheaper money as the Fed indicated a rate cut is on the cards. Gold was a big beneficiary jumping $40 in Asia and holding firm for the rest of the day as markets reposition themselves further.

I played it a couple times and watched my friend play, the actual problem is a big strategy is sitting on your gold so that accrues intrest and buying items at the right time and keeping an eye on 8 Opponents so it's more like a trading stocks game?
284 2019-06-20 21:41:31 One day I want to write a comprehensive article of why stocks and investments aren’t fair inherently, and how publicly-traded companies that try to sell something that “benefits the masses” is just a scam and makes the rich richer.

289 2019-06-20 21:40:54 Exactly hes just using his words right to manipulate. He knows he wasnt the reason stocks grew 50% all he knows is that since he became president it grew 50% then ozzie came in here & showed me that it grew 50% that's why I thanked u for showing me what really happened bhris

315 2019-06-20 21:32:24 Stocks went up nearly 300% under Obama. You have no claim or did anything to have the stocks go up. It was a continuation of Obama’s success. You will however be responsible for the looming crash
316 2019-06-20 21:32:07 Exactly. Starting with a rate cut first was expected. But I’m surprised by QE4 before a crash or major correction. Once QE4 triggered, load up on anything not nailed down. Energy stocks and industrial metals as well as defence.

322 2019-06-20 21:30:35 I think it is also worth noting that the recent ATH in the $SPX is largely defensive plays with REITS, Utilities, Consumer Staples leading to new highs. From what I remember back in Jan. this was not quite the same case. There is a bull market coming w/ cyclical stocks rotating.
323 2019-06-20 21:28:44 B.F.D. The stock got crushed again today on over 6X average daily volume ending up a smidge obove 5 cents a share and down 32%+. These suckers buying tonight will be swept aside by more massive selling tomorrow. $LGCY is one of the worst touted stocks I have yet to see on Twitter

326 2019-06-20 21:27:52 Bro...what are you even talking about rn that wasn’t even a topic. And yes, holding money and not spending is financial literacy because if these “reparations amounts” are what they supposed to be, it’ll def gain plenty of interest in bonds, stocks,CDs, IRAs etc.

333 2019-06-20 21:23:26 @ianlopuch ian as a Canadian investor I have to pay 15% tax on US stock dividends in my tax free savings account. Should this preclude me from doing the dividend investing strategy?or should the better growth prospects of us stocks negate the tax?

It’s actually made me do more research into stuff I’d previously have ignored ...Carp/Golden Turd type stocks ...so I’m definitely a fan.. it’s not changed my investment mindset yet...but it has made me think a lot about what investments I’m turning down & why
337 2019-06-20 21:21:40 Probably the question I’ve heard from Financial Media the most since I’ve been investing is “is it too late to buy into stocks”...they’ve been asking that weekly for over 10-years

Because for the last couple years of his term, unemployment was steadily decreasing and stocks going up.
399 2019-06-20 20:53:27 Very good question BZ. Have been asking that myself. Seems to me we’re repricing towards 10 x eps. Some of the higher multiple bank stocks have sold off more again. Many serial acquirers seem to have retreated back to Dec lows as well.
400 2019-06-20 20:53:09 We should be very thankful for the federal reserve tbh. If it wasnt for them, how would we be able to get rich off of the blood and sweat of the poor by holding stocks and commodities? So kind of them to give the rich free money.
401 2019-06-20 20:52:32 Shareholders expected NCLT wouldn't favour the liquidation, so the stocks shot up temporarily. 
Unfortunately tribunal has ordered for a resolution within 90 days, so let's wait for the market opening today.

403 2019-06-20 20:51:35 Too old to wield weapons so I’m going for poisoned pulses. In peak siege mode at the start of the year I laid in stocks of lentils & assorted dried beans even though I don’t really like them! Need to get rid somehow.
404 2019-06-20 20:51:22 you know what Ive noticed in trying to catch momo stocks
405 2019-06-20 20:50:46 Stocks, crypto, gold, everything looks bullish...so where’s the contrarian bet?
406 2019-06-20 20:50:32 Tomorrow: expiry and many indexes rebalancing.
As always, check at what time indexes are expiring and which stocks are in/out.

414 2019-06-20 20:47:30 Do you honestly think that the mechanisms of enrichment will suddenly end as boomers die off?  That housing prices will suddenly depreciate, that stocks will suddenly stop generating returns?  That your careers will not advance?  Stop falling into the trap of navel gazing!

424 2019-06-20 20:42:53 Bought a stock called Nanologix NNLX like 9 years ago at .05  It popped to $1.50 in a few days. Sold it all and bought back in at .03  NNLX hasn’t moved since lol, but I’m still holding 30k shares just for lotto & nostalgia. Seems to be one of the few legit penny stocks. RR & DD
425 2019-06-20 20:42:28 While US stocks make record highs, bonds are rising. That doesn't bode well for the so called "safety flight" into bonds. Calling the end of a 35 year bull turned bubble isn't easy. But the trend can only change one way and when it does, the bondtards will be the fools.
426 2019-06-20 20:41:37 Purell stocks have just skyrocketed!

432 2019-06-20 20:39:48 Some stocks are for quick gains some are for sitting on a -12 dollars sucks but it also depends on how much money you dropped if you put 50 in and lost 12 your not doing well if you put 100000 sit on it it will jump again then sell just before you feel you should

435 2019-06-20 20:38:25 Stocks took off in the early 1900's because of liberty bonds.
Liberty bonds caused people to go through the same motions as someone owning stocks. So the transition to owning stocks was easy.

#Libra might do this for cryptocurrency.

440 2019-06-20 20:35:29 My dividends are at an all time high?  When companies are making profits, those of us investors in our IRAs, 401ks, and stocks for our retirement, are greatly relived. Under Obama I lost money! But I still invested, and now I shot up! Thanks President Trump
441 2019-06-20 20:34:59 like @grimacemcdonal1 says.. go 100% stock for a few days, than when reality hits short it all.  Gonna inverse leverage, then dump my 10s and 30s on the secondary wen the panic starts..buy insurance b4 the  house burns then sell u the fire hose! #stocks #investing #NEWS #Economy

444 2019-06-20 20:34:13 Anyone else a little uncomfortable with stocks closing at record highs in the midst of the fed signaling they are going to cut rates?
445 2019-06-20 20:34:12 Pick better stocks.
446 2019-06-20 20:32:40 Although bonds are overbought, it's difficult to imagine a scenario where both stocks and bonds would go down from here. It'd take a non-rate-cut accompanied with a trade war escalation. So, I think a stock 60:bond 40 allocation would do very fine $SPX $RUT $NDX
447 2019-06-20 20:32:35 Stocks move back to session highs as the rate-cut euphoria elevates the S&amp;P 500 to a record high.
448 2019-06-20 20:32:30 Near midday, Mortgage Bonds slightly higher. Stocks holding gains. 10-yr yield 1.99%.
449 2019-06-20 20:32:21 US Navy drone shot down by Iranian missile over Strait of Hormuz in an unprovoked attack. Stocks give up some gains. 10-yr yield declines to
450 2019-06-20 20:32:01 Maybe it's all the tail wagging the dog so (1) Trump looks tough to his base before he declares he "solved" another problem of his own making, and (2) I wouldn't rule out that Wilbur Ross, Mnunchin, and others aren't trading gold stocks in lockstep with WH military drumbeating.
451 2019-06-20 20:31:34 Omg I literally just bought that shirt. Looking good!
452 2019-06-20 20:31:19 Lmao this isn’t an accurate article.. lol.. should do some research before just posting.. there’s a lot of stocks this year up 200-300-400%... they are just talking about the “indexes” here..

456 2019-06-20 20:29:54 So true. I have had a few friends try the penny stock game. One on them purchased at less than .50cents. Stock rose to over 3bucks and could not sell. More than once. Then he thru in the towel. No penny stocks no more. 
457 2019-06-20 20:29:40 This is a lie!!  So many stores have closed in the last 2 years!  Sears, K-mart, Herbergers, Pay-less, Shopko and Dress Barn just to name a few.  The jobs lost with these stores is huge!  My stocks went up one month and then returned to previous value!  Brainwashing America!
458 2019-06-20 20:29:26 Yeah the stocks thing though.. that’s just people who are already rich. The rest is good though.
459 2019-06-20 20:29:16 I  said "there is a fire" Eventually $HURA will reach a significant net asset value, but $3m right now, it's a low volume stock little liquidity, c11,734 traded today & the stock was down. Compare $URA c145,000 todays vol + $218m Assets up 2.25%. + Many U stocks up nicely today
460 2019-06-20 20:29:13 Tromp tweets "trouble with China" and the stocks down. Next day, he says the opposite and stocks up, FOR HIM, and his gang! He wants to keep being president, just to make billions on his Citizen's expenses!The U.S. economy up?? Where? Around $20 trillions is good? Mostly to China

462 2019-06-20 20:28:41 democratizing!  this stocks and I want to make a difference. Now, let's think about that? How does an individual obtain all of the above without purchasing a snake type dress? Attitude! not temper tantrums.
463 2019-06-20 20:28:37 Under Obama my investments were stagnant, I'm now up 43%, my stocks are doing excellent! My IRA is through the roof!  Thank you President Trump! I can now retire earlier than expected. I don't understand why Democrats want to destroy peoples retirement?
464 2019-06-20 20:28:12 What you explained is just as bad as what you did. You don’t keep up w stocks either but you still took what trump said as a truth rather than making sure that was right. We all gotta do research

477 2019-06-20 20:24:29 Great job pointing in them in the right direction. Stocks, bonds, real estate and even hedge funds and private equity is the old way. I tell my students to look towards the new wealth creation opportunities.

479 2019-06-20 20:22:50 I mean, it's also worth noting that the stock market as a whole is on an upswing. Lots of stocks are going up. Adobe is up 10 percent, I guess we need Photoshop for the upcoming war?

486 2019-06-20 20:19:40 And then you go on TV and crash it- you moron!

Stocks under pressure as President Trump says, "you'll find out" whether the U.S. will strike Iran after the latter shot down a U.S. drone.

493 2019-06-20 20:18:06 I bought some $GDX today for a gold breakout play. I am sick of these rate cut talks (and pricing) while S&P is at ATH. Meanwhile, I am still long stocks and bonds which I expect to continue to do well. End of rant
494 2019-06-20 20:17:48 S&M festival. So many easier ways to make money, like buying stocks that go up in value. Shiny rock is up 0% in 10 years.
495 2019-06-20 20:17:17 World stocks rally: US +1%; Europe +.4%. Markets continue to react to hints & rumors of China resolution & FED cuts. They ignore overhanging dangers of failure & now armed confrontation with Iran. Markets getting expensive again so prudence is called for. Volatility will be issue
496 2019-06-20 20:17:02 Old world:
Gold = store of value

Fiat = currency

New word:
Bitcoin = store of value
Alts = trading assets
Facebook Libra = global currency

Goodbye USD, EUR...
497 2019-06-20 20:17:01 Obama inherited disaster. After 2008 bailout, economic indicators have increased under both administrations equally. Income inequality has also continued to increase. Stocks are inflated because of buy-backs and brow-beating fed to keep interest low. Cruelty is not "politics"BTW.
498 2019-06-20 20:16:52 Isn't it automatically calculated in America? It takes like 5 min to quickly scroll through my tax return paper before i sign it online. And I own stocks, got loans etc.

500 2019-06-20 20:13:27 MSFT and MA pay dividends and are great growth stocks. I had a fuck ton of money in both but couldn’t handle the October drop
501 2019-06-20 20:13:07 Brutal stock to short, even with wide spreads. The candle looks pretty bad on the daily though. Hopefully you get something back tomorrow! These narrative driven stocks capture imagination and play with traders limbic systems. Im considering shorting some of these names soon.
502 2019-06-20 20:12:49 $GDX seeing gold miners breaking of bases left n right. most r penny stocks lol
503 2019-06-20 20:12:27 Stocks went up more under Obama and job growth is lower now than during the last 2 years of Obama. Obama better.

506 2019-06-20 20:11:53 My dad knows a guy that became a millionaire after he bought stocks in the 90s at a 400 buy in at a dollar a share. After 9/11 happened, that when the cash rolled in.
507 2019-06-20 20:11:52 I usually trade $SPY so maybe 50, 100, 200 sma don't work on individual stocks? Idk.

519 2019-06-20 20:07:32 $work is disappointing first day trading. It closed where it opened. $38.50  Went 10% higher and came back.

520 2019-06-20 20:07:29 The s&p 500 closed at a record high and the 10-year-bond yield dipped below 2% as the prospect of a fresh rate cut boosted stocks and bonds. And you tell me you still got 30% in cash? Yeah no.

531 2019-06-20 20:04:43 Stocks rally. The Dow closed at 26,753.17, up 249.17 (+0.94%). Nasdaq +0.80%. S&P +0.95%.
532 2019-06-20 20:04:19 Point being is we're not yet past point of no return on GHG atmospheric stocks and radiative forcing. Despite the catch phrase "warming in the pipeline", fact is there's not much due to GHG's. At 1C, we have an *ambitious* longshot.

533 2019-06-20 20:03:48 REMEMBER:   Stocks usually do crazy zooms around round numbers. usually $100.   a $BTC at $10k and $ETH at $300 will have same effect. Not scientific. just based on experience.  chugga, chugga, choo, choo!

536 2019-06-20 20:03:17 I’m getting better at predicting which stocks to invest in at what time. Trading is just barely profitable for me right now because I’ve been afraid to play with too much money but I’m feeling more confident.
537 2019-06-20 20:02:36 This is all well and good, but the younger generations have no stocks.  They carry only usurious debt on their backs from colleges who quadrupled their tuition, offer programs that result in no real jobs and have awful teachers who can't get fired. This is untenable.

544 2019-06-20 20:01:07 Fed buys stocks
545 2019-06-20 20:00:38 The reason stocks are up today is speculation the the fed will lower interest rates. The only reason the fed would lower interest rates is because the economy is doing poorly. You'd have to be Trump level stupid to brag about this.
546 2019-06-20 20:00:00 Since only 20 percent of people can afford to own stocks, tough shit.
547 2019-06-20 20:00:00 Treasuries rallied and the dollar fell after central banks around the world continued a shift toward easier monetary policy. U.S. stocks climbed to records before pulling back amid rising tensions with Iran. - Bloomberg

551 2019-06-20 19:57:09 3/3 oops.
Cutting taxes usually increases debt.

The interest payments that come out of our taxes go directly into the pockets of those who own the bonds and bank stocks.

Cutting taxes is basically a way to siphon money out of our pockets & into theirs.

A few weeks ago I asked @A_Milewski about listing $KBLT.v on big boards, his excuse was that there were greater regulatory hurdles (yet tiny mcap stocks like $EMX are on US exchanges).

605 2019-06-20 19:41:35 It's important point what u said. So why is that happening? Bc stocks are a fixed income asset. Why? Because huge debt liabilities. Basically, there is no equity in equities. Therefore, to remove principal risk, fed has become risk manager for Corp america.
606 2019-06-20 19:40:31 Won’t Wesdome underperform in a bull market in Gold?

Now the because of price of Gold stocks will start working(ALO, VGZ, AUY, IAG, etc).

It's better for the environment to let those "upcycled" byproducts and waste be burned or rot in a landfill than be fermented in a cow's gut. Methane is potent stuff, and cows "upcycle" a lot of it into methane.

644 2019-06-20 19:20:46 how would you test this? the closest you'd get is to grab every player who has ever competed from florida and have them play 8 player smash w/ 99 stocks, zackray needs to SD his way down to 3 stocks and then beat all 7 other 'players' (floridans switching out every 1-3 stocks)
645 2019-06-20 19:20:16 Either stocks or land
646 2019-06-20 19:19:45 Thanks Evan. Watching it closely. 
Any idea what the market is doing here with bonds, gold, oil and stocks all up? Just celebrating USD weakness?
647 2019-06-20 19:19:44 Is it like a real stock market where you can sell and buy stocks!?

650 2019-06-20 19:18:29 Can we make causal inferences from correlational data? Can we reject the hypothesis that HFCS is making us fat? Can we confirm that hypothesis?

No, we can't. But we can find correlations that suggest any changes we've made recently are bad. We just can't know which are causal.

666 2019-06-20 19:13:10 $ALO up 15% today from $.62 to $.72. Book value is $3. Cash on hand is $.22/sh. Forward PE is 2.  With gold at 1350 they should earn at least $.25/sh. Fair value at $4.00. 
When gold makes a run the weakest stocks benefit the most.

685 2019-06-20 19:06:19 Thanks for bringing in data.

This study was done using global figures. Worldwide, cows eat less grain than in the USA. Even when they're mostly grass-fed, they still eat 3x more grain.

But the problem isn't the food they eat. We have plenty of food. The problem is the GHGs.

697 2019-06-20 19:00:50 I am aware of only three leading indicators of price: momentum, volume, and volatility. A professional short-term trader seeks to stack the odds in his favor by combining at least one of these in his trades #stocks

700 2019-06-20 18:59:49 Ha. Well. No. But the market's amoral. The stocks are up because they may cut interest rates which signals higher dividends/valuations. Is that ever going to reach normal people? No, unless they're investing upwards of half a mil, which would make them not-normal people.

714 2019-06-20 18:54:38 Other BIG mistake: looking at fixed income “risks” in isolation. Fear of rising rates = frequently cited as reason to buy CDs, but moderate global term/credit exposure isn’t correlated to equity/size/value risk & isn’t additive to balanced portfolio. 99% of 60/40 risk from stocks

718 2019-06-20 18:53:50 Sure, the stocks are blowing off and likely to test near 3,000 on S&P 500 Index by early July. But, it‘ll attract more and more speculative interest which makes it harder to rally further as it takes much more cash to pay the leveraged positions. Then, comes a sudden break...
719 2019-06-20 18:53:46 Similar story for me, penny stocks when I was a genius and gambling when I was stupid. Now avoid both like the plague.
720 2019-06-20 18:53:13 Seen that! Decent draw 
721 2019-06-20 18:52:50 Or both markets are Fed driven and stocks are rallying on easy money as are bonds. Said another way, it's less about the fundamentals and more about the Fed action.

726 2019-06-20 18:51:27 believe the argument is more that by investing in illiquid stocks when you know you do not prioritize that feature in your investments, you will collect a premium for that service. In theory.
727 2019-06-20 18:51:22 And you can have all the stocks and bonds you need in roofing companies, construction companies, car manufacturing,  the paper mill,  Hercules, hospitals, banks and institutions, it still won't excuse a damn one of us today.

729 2019-06-20 18:50:56 I would support that if the evidence supported that strategy as being significantly better, but it doesn't. Grain-fed beef and grass-fed beef are both at least 4x worse than chicken, and 10x-50x worse than plants for the environment. In some studies grass-fed is even worse.

734 2019-06-20 18:49:14 And to move the term "investing" beyond stocks, you can buy some of anything and hope to sell it later. Buying shoes and jewelry can be deemed investments. I've invested in bottles of alcohol to sell later. A $1.99 pack of baseball cards can be an investment.

749 2019-06-20 18:43:29 The way I see it, ‘stocks’ aren’t always biologically discrete & their borders are often drawn for pragmatic management purposes, whereas ‘populations’ are discrete biological units. In an ideal world stock boundaries would match population boundaries, which is not the case.
750 2019-06-20 18:43:25 If I spend $1 a day of disposable income a year on stocks, I've spent $365 in total and would likely have somewhere between $180 and $500 to show for it. 

If I spend $1/day on anything else, I more than likely have $0-$365 to show for it.

753 2019-06-20 18:41:57 .@realDonaldTrump Yeah, unemployment is lo & the stock market is hi. Stocks benefit the top 10% of wealthy Americans who own 84% of stocks. & while more people r employed now than during the Great Recession, the vast majority of Americans haven’t had a REAL raise since 1979.
754 2019-06-20 18:41:53 That’s a smart decision, esp given the trend for the economy is heading. I’m expecting a huge downfall (not as drastic as 07-09) but that’s just the trend of how it works. We have a boost in market prices, stocks etc&then it tanks 
Glad you guys have a solid plan tho!

Every single day for a week now!
I'm not complaining God, I just say make I share good news
774 2019-06-20 18:32:00 And that’s still a risk. U gotta choose a stock U HOPE does something.
U do enough $1 stocks and it just sits, you’ll lose more . That’s a really valid fear
775 2019-06-20 18:31:43 My friend asked what to do with $300K cash.  I told him to wait 6 months or so and he can buy dividend stocks at amazing prices.

780 2019-06-20 18:30:09 I agree w you but look what they did the past 10 yrs. we didn’t have growth. We has 2 % gdp but stocks still have been going to the stratosphere. If the fed was able to prop x 10 yrs what will change then for this market to come down big? Gundlach said we are in a bear market but
781 2019-06-20 18:29:43 Dollar is down because stocks are up. Some people think fed cuts are dollar negative. Fed cuts are actually signals for risk aversion which is dollar positive. King dollar will reign supreme.
782 2019-06-20 18:27:43 Yes.. the farmers and mine workers have all their money in stocks.

785 2019-06-20 18:24:49 The stocks don't trend in a single direction long enough for the traders to make money. They either pause or reverse. The bid-ask spread and the commissions ensure  that trading is not a zero sum game and some money is always taken out from the market for each trade.
786 2019-06-20 18:24:39 U.S. stocks briefly dipped to session lows after Trump said “you’ll soon find out” when asked if the U.S. would strike Iran. They resumed their climb with his subsequent comments about Iran’s intentions. - @CNBC

797 2019-06-20 18:19:49 Shades of late 2007 when stocks, gold, bonds all rallied on Fed easing. Gold went for 6 mths, 50%, but stocks only got back to the previous high then bear mkt started. Think people might be wrong-footed chasing gold. Don't have the late-cycle inflationary back-drop of late 2007.

811 2019-06-20 18:11:37 Market Mein last 5 years Mein ye hua.. ki stocks apne 700-900 days ki moving average se 80-90% gir rahe Hain.. yet some people say . Now is the opportunity to buy..

Imagine how many investors might be stuck during that period ..

I'm talking about 1000 trading days ..
812 2019-06-20 18:11:35 Update- Energy futures/stocks rebounding from oversold conditions, seasonality issues finally favor bulls. L/T bears now standing aside, will return later this summer.  MSFT pushed above resistance. Guessing bulls more willing to buy near-term supports on s/t weakness.
813 2019-06-20 18:11:35 Only about 50% of Americans are invested in the market, and this nbr includes retirement funds like 401k. Of this 50% the wealthiest 1% own 50% of stocks. Yes, the rich are getting richer.
814 2019-06-20 18:11:12 I’m bad enough at stocks.  Probably better for me to not mess with options too.
815 2019-06-20 18:10:11 John, Your thoughts please? What would a 5% quota do for US mining stocks especially if it increases YoY.  That is probably the maximum speed all current US producers could get up to 25

817 2019-06-20 18:08:54 Stocks would be up & economy would continue growing as it started wObama even w/o you in office.

824 2019-06-20 18:04:28 You must be very gullible if you believe that. The CFP destroyed our fishing stocks and fleet; the CAP raised food prices and via butter and beef mountains and wine lakes now just hands out money to landowners to spend as they like. ERM membership cost us billions. Etc etc etc.
825 2019-06-20 18:03:59 What resources would you recommend for researching quality mining stocks
826 2019-06-20 18:03:27 I don’t do individual stocks, I aim for the index funds
827 2019-06-20 18:03:13 Short term. Your tax cut certainly helped my stock portfolio, but it didn’t go into corporate investment in R & D or innovation. Just buybacks. So stocks WILL fall. Typical Republican short term thinking.

835 2019-06-20 17:57:28 It's hard to analysts to adapt to new paradigm. They see stocks building after few yrs of deficit & look for a reason that doesn't change the paradigm, i.e. after protracted refinery maintenance, all back to "normal." I'm suggesting normal has changed.

But another positive is P.E. ratios are now at an all time low, meaning stocks are being priced on fundamentals rather than speculation; thus less likely to drop.

The surge in index is due to specific stocks OR enhanced and continues inflows OR sheer underperformance of most of the fund managers of active funds? A blog post helps.
882 2019-06-20 17:38:31 They already cut taxes and regulations for big business and they still out sourced jobs, didn’t reinvest in the company but did stock buy backs with the cuts which creates artificial demand for stocks and now were in a cooperate debt bubble. Terrible

886 2019-06-20 17:38:24 Well, Fox people, here are your choices for reporting Trump's 'stocks up 50%':
1. Use the 50%. Our viewers believe all of Trump's lies
2. Pretend it never happened (Trump? Remember something? Ha!)
3. Pretend we're REAL news reporters & tell the TRUTH!

I put #3 there as a joke.

Unfortunately most Americans are not benefitting from SM boom.
890 2019-06-20 17:37:47 The average person doesn’t understand how to trade stocks. 

If the market thinks it should be valued at 23b, then that’s what it’ll be. If the market determines its overvalued, then the stock will go down. Pretty simple really.
891 2019-06-20 17:37:43 Idiots. As a responsible gun owner I am all for regulations that will make America safer from gun zealots like the one above. Also I don't think any civilian has any need for bump stocks/AR-15 type weapons. If you need that to hunt game, you shouldn't be hunting.

These software stocks are pretty incredible.  Valuations are so ridiculous on some of them but people are doing the relative valuation game when anchoring their theses which works well in bull markets.
895 2019-06-20 17:36:20 Observing far too many people allowing their marginal tax rate to dictate their investment decisions.  

i.e. if you're 80 and are a low-risk investor, you need bonds. 

Dividend stocks and pref shares are NOT bonds.

I have many stories from 2008 to elaborate

904 2019-06-20 17:32:07 I have sat on the sidelines in cash for 6 months watching stocks climb past me, in fear. Today I surrendered and jumped back in. The free money will keep flowing folks. Until it doesn’t.
905 2019-06-20 17:31:53 A company not selling its product and making cash can’t buyback their stock. If a company is failing and not successful it can’t jus say “ok, let’s buy back stocks bc we suck and still need to get paid”. Lol. Geez. 

It takes profits and buys back stocks. That’s heathy as hell!
906 2019-06-20 17:31:38 It's over valued was the point.  and yes billionaires playing the market is what stocks are all about.  Your average person owns zero stock,

908 2019-06-20 17:30:55 Very interesting!
You are extremely bullish on stocks and gold and by that a contrarian.
909 2019-06-20 17:30:52 Anyone else find it amusing stocks $SPY, bonds $TLT, & gold $GLD are all hitting multi year or all time highs together?

914 2019-06-20 17:28:58 Well, it could tell them to invest in baked beans and sniper rifles, or to get the hell out of the pound and UK stocks but it didn't seem to be doing that last time I looked.
915 2019-06-20 17:28:46 Wow, does Fox help Trump with his idiotic lies? 50% stock increase?!?

I think that Trump saw that one company's stocks had gone up 50% when it went public & since Trump can barely read, that's the number that he used!

That's our president who "knows more than financial people"?
916 2019-06-20 17:28:19 I wouldn't be surprised at all. I truly believe they are going to willfully crash the dollar over the next few years. I could be totally off but does a weak dollar correlate to a high price on stocks as well? Maybe its a subtle way to save their shit show.
917 2019-06-20 17:28:09 Anytime a company buys back their stocks it removes the available stocks on the market. And that derivative or valuation lowers their debt ratios. And that’s what increases the valuation of the stock.

I’m not saying stockholders don’t make more, that’s the definition of success
918 2019-06-20 17:27:53 Right ok, thank you for that. My local garden centre stocks a few varieties, so well done to themI will see what they’ve got.

922 2019-06-20 17:26:14 ...that’s not how this works. You invest in a company and it’s value rises. You should learn about stocks before commenting on it....
Lol, anyone can invest in public companies. This isn’t just billionaires giving this company billions of dollars. That’s not how this works.
923 2019-06-20 17:26:09 That's great if you have stocks, which the majority of  Americans do not. The rich get richer, the poor, well, to bad you didn't get 400 million from daddy like he did.

925 2019-06-20 17:25:58 @SqueezeMetrics thinking of giving your service a spin. Do you just get General directional indicators or is it specific for individual stocks?
926 2019-06-20 17:25:54 How about if Trump told the truth for once?  Who’s stocks have gone up - the billionaires Trump gave a big tax cut to?
927 2019-06-20 17:24:40 Honest question. Could that not be just a market cap thing? 68% of S&P500 stocks are above their 200 DMA. June 6, 25% SPX stocks hit new 52 wk highs with 10% hitting new highs last 2 days. Last 25 yrs, SPX perform best when large-caps lead.

943 2019-06-20 17:18:17 Kroenke would be ousted within a year if the fans did their part and stopped backing him regardless of league position and performances.

944 2019-06-20 17:18:13 I only trade my own stuff. There are >7000 stocks. Moreover VFF has no fundamentals and I rarely engange with stocks without solid forward EPS or Q/Q sales.
945 2019-06-20 17:18:06 Voted for trump. But not this time. Trump’s attacks on gun owners has got to stop. He has banned bump stocks, pushed for red flag laws and now wants to ban suppressors. I am going to stay home election night.
946 2019-06-20 17:18:05 A company taking their cash from profits and buying their stocks back lowers their debt, like you paying off your debt. That’s healthy, and way better than govt printing money and investing in the bond market to hold stock prices steady, bc the companies don’t have the cash!

959 2019-06-20 17:13:29 What did “stocks” do the 2.5yrs before that?  Up .... and the 2.5yrs before that?  Up.  Pretty much since late 2011.   To say it would have crashed but for you is a fiction you can choose to think or not.  Trend lines and global economic forces tend to say things were fine.

963 2019-06-20 17:12:55 1) stocks don't equal economy
2) expectations of fed rate cut drove the high
2a) AHEAD of July date expected
3) unneeded rate cut due to your tariffs
4) rate cuts signal a slow-down, not a ramp-up
5) the only parts of this you can take credit for are all BAD

969 2019-06-20 17:10:55 WHERE do you get stocks up 50%? No wonder you've gone bankrupt so many times!

Average increase of S&P adjusted for inflation:
Trump:    2017 thru 2018:     6.6%
Obama:  2009 thru 2016:   13.0%

Hillary's increase would have been like Obama's - so about double Trump's!
970 2019-06-20 17:10:50 C: "Historically, when the Fed cuts for the first time: (i) average SPX performance is positive but dragged down by recessions like 01 and 07. In 1995 US stocks were 10-15% higher six months after the Fed cut. In 1998 the gain was more like 25%."

1004 2019-06-20 16:59:17 In advance of what? A recession? Stocks near ATH’s doesn’t signal the fed is ahead of the curve when the cuts begin—that is the premise of the argument. Everything else is extraneous. Equities don’t lead, they follow credit & fin conditions and reprice immediately like Q418. 1/2

1006 2019-06-20 16:58:46 True. People with the mindset like “if I could travel back in time, I would definitely buy this and that when they are 1/100 of their current value.” No they are not. They would continue trash those stocks.
1007 2019-06-20 16:58:14 In fact many mid & large cap stocks are like small caps considering the size of opportunity & mcap of global peers.
1008 2019-06-20 16:57:43 Nothin’ like a war to distract from the fact that a crime ring is running our country - and the crime ring gets to start the war! Bonus. How many trump insiders are getting long in defense stocks and options? (Easiest prediction ever.)

If flows to smart beta cause the lowest P/B stocks to have a higher P/B than previously, that seems a semi-permanent condition that would hurt Value's relative returns

1023 2019-06-20 16:52:21 Sounds like stocks will be higher Fri....possibly Mon to finish at. New Record Highs....hmmm
1024 2019-06-20 16:51:02 When it comes to stocks, the market is at present by three forces. First and foremost, US monetary policy (the Fed). Then China's monetary & fiscal policy, and Trump's trade wars / international spats.
1025 2019-06-20 16:50:39 We don't have an expected timeframe for when this maintenance will be complete, but we're happy to let you know once you can transfer stocks into Robinhood again. We appreciate your patience and understanding.
1026 2019-06-20 16:50:06 $AEO lower rates should be working their way into better consumer-related data over next cpl months - even mall traffic - and retail stocks will "catch up" soon!
1027 2019-06-20 16:49:48 Goldman is probably holding some oil stocks in their portfolio.
1028 2019-06-20 16:49:45 Some of us are old enough to remember that stocks can actually go down.  But we have a Fed so hell bent on increasing inflation and reducing our standard of living, that maybe stocks will go up forever.  Ask the Venezuelans how that works out.
1029 2019-06-20 16:49:18 Sure thing. Wally World stocks it
1030 2019-06-20 16:49:14 One of my stocks went up almost 1400% today and I coulda made so much money

1032 2019-06-20 16:48:06 Yeah I’m buying the Slack direct offering (essentially an IPO). $WORK is a solid company with a clear monetization. #stocks #trading #investing
1033 2019-06-20 16:47:50 #crux investors’ interview with Bhandari states; poor upside in #uranium stocks  as analysts’ reports indicates 100% upsides but that already assumes #uranium price of 50. - What are your thoughts on this? Correct? Incorrect?
1034 2019-06-20 16:47:41 Everywhere in the world everything repeats itself (fractals of life ). Scouting for good opportunities (“picking stocks or markets ”) is the LEAST work . It’s between 5-20 percent of my time . 80-95% is : what to do with it and how to exploit it <—> derivative structuring
1035 2019-06-20 16:47:32 It's not sustainable if it's depleting existing fish stocks or contributing to climate change. And all signs point to THIS being the case, not your version.

1039 2019-06-20 16:46:57 Hey everybody wonder what Raytheon and halliburton stocks are doing now I see the market is still up???
1040 2019-06-20 16:46:48 I hope you all invest at least 10% of your income. I’m more like 30%. Here are some suggestions on where to put it.
Bitcoin / Silver / KCS coin bonus of 7% paid / Cash, should have 3 months expenses / stocks that pay dividends / Property, pay extra monthly / mutual funds, RothIRA
1041 2019-06-20 16:46:32 The hammer that will crack this nut is an exit strategy whereby an investor can turn in hundreds of stocks in exchange for a single ETF that takes on the overall cost basis of the portfolio. Maybe some smart VC money will figure that one out.

1045 2019-06-20 16:44:40 #Nifty #Sensex : What happened in some stocks today, resembles scenes of those horror movies where Zombie once killed, resurrects for a short time only to get killed by Hero again. See if you can find out, Who's Zombie and Who's Hero !!! 
1046 2019-06-20 16:44:11 I mean I know a ton of my friends have 401k's!!!! It's not like companies would exploit the working class for a profit, for their share holders, for stocks. Yea that would never happen. Ever. Not ever never ever
1047 2019-06-20 16:44:09 If!!! You do realize that less than half of the people own stocks right? Most of them are not your base!
1048 2019-06-20 16:43:53 Today this president is enjoying himself by tweeting to Reps. & Fox news friends about how low employment is and the stocks is up, in other words “me” “me” “me” in the mean time the United States might go to war, deploying thousands of our troops, who are fathers, mothers
1049 2019-06-20 16:43:50 Y’all can be Hot Girls if you want to. I’m still tryna be Beyoncé, B-Day. Queen was hittin 3 million in stocks at 26
1050 2019-06-20 16:43:39 apple stocks rise by 10%.
1051 2019-06-20 16:43:34 It's the basic human nature (Gambling with hope, Yudhisthira in Maharashtra) & no sensible Investor invest in such stocks only greedy people can gamble.. so no sympathy for such people even if they lost 121% it's also applies to ppl who lose money in Ponzi schemes.
1052 2019-06-20 16:43:18 Stocks mean nithi g to most of America. Only the wralthy
1053 2019-06-20 16:42:42 @SlackHQ stocks have just started publicly trading. I think it would be a good investment, but of course I don't wanna mix business and pleasure too much...
1054 2019-06-20 16:41:48 Well my oil stocks are finally up!!
1055 2019-06-20 16:41:44 Did you rebalance for the upcoming Bond market?

"Bonds climb with stocks as central banks give dovish signals."

Just a reminder if you had that on your list of things to do. Maybe you're fine with the balance of your portfolio, but I ride the risk wave over in currency. >
1056 2019-06-20 16:41:37 More than half the country doesn't own stocks and doesn't give a shit about them.

But you and your rich buddies own stocks, lots of them.

1057 2019-06-20 16:41:33 What is more stressful? Moving or movers talking about stocks and options?
1058 2019-06-20 16:41:27 Is it bad timing to stay in the stocks or keep it for next 3 months?
1059 2019-06-20 16:41:24 I’ve always enjoyed Clark and believe he usually gives great info.  So hearing him say bitcoin ‘isn’t real’ was highly disappointing.  I’ve paid off more debt with earnings from bitcoin than I ever will with the ‘real’ stocks in my 401k

1060 2019-06-20 16:41:18 Perso, je les stocks dans des pots à la maison 
1061 2019-06-20 16:41:10 try having a list of 50 stocks you need to place an order for at any moment by th end of the day and calculate margins for each. Its not even possible. Id be forced to use their TOS platform which is junk at this stage in software and really built for options
1062 2019-06-20 16:40:41 The global bond market continues to surge! $BWX  I run an individual bond fund with 11 bonds in it based on Best Stocks.
1063 2019-06-20 16:40:16 The only way Boris could entertain me is by entering the stocks at the Tower of London. Permanently. #bbcpm
1064 2019-06-20 16:40:10 stocks are falling! sell! vende vende vende!!!
1065 2019-06-20 16:39:53 The point is that 90% of the time there are no "sale" items to be had and you'll just be sitting on your hands watching other people making money while you make none. Entering a trend already 50% up is better than waiting for "sale" stocks that may never materialise.
1066 2019-06-20 16:39:35 Can't escape the fact that historically, stocks take a dump when the Fed commences with an easing cycle. Wouldn't be the least bit surprised to see $SPX close below 2,900.
1067 2019-06-20 16:38:54 I would have liked him to have been given a chance this season, very impressive for the U23’s but hey ho
1068 2019-06-20 16:38:50 Bring back the stocks
1069 2019-06-20 16:38:49 Its just getting dark in #Iran....will the U-S strike following the drone shootdown? #POTUS says we'll soon find out. #Oil is surging higher by 5.5%, nearing $57.  Equities are getting a boost from energy stocks as a result, #DOW+116
1070 2019-06-20 16:38:13 L'Iran vient de descendre un drone US, faites vos stocks de carburant lol en cas de conflit, les prix vont flamber...
1071 2019-06-20 16:38:08 that awko taco moment when your mom walks in on you putting 75% of your pay check into your robin hood stocks portfolio. mom i’m gonna have to ask you to leave there’s things happening on a corporate level right now.
1072 2019-06-20 16:37:25 But you always kind find US stocks which perform well- and use derivatives to both juice up gains and make them less vulnerable .
1073 2019-06-20 16:37:19 Trump asked if US will strike Iran says "You'll soon find out".

This news is pushing the US stocks lower.

71% of retail CFD accounts lose money.
1074 2019-06-20 16:37:11 Investing in unregulated markets is uh, not a good idea. You should not do that. Especially when you don’t have access to all the data. 

You are also worse than a computer algorithm when it comes to stocks of any kind. 

That is my soapbox statement of the day.
1075 2019-06-20 16:36:55 wondering.. who could buy and sell such stocks..
If waited so long to sell..or buying now...!! What kind of traders will belong to this category ..!
1076 2019-06-20 16:36:51 I wonder how many Rethuglian senators own stocks in defense contractor businesses?...hmmmm
1077 2019-06-20 16:36:39 I love it Jim. 
Thank you for making stocks fun again!!!!
1078 2019-06-20 16:36:35 As far as reparation I would only really want either money or land. Possibly gold... I would not accept stocks or bonds, not saying that you can't make money off that.

But, I do think free education should be a reparation too.
1079 2019-06-20 16:36:33 ahahahahaha  400 miles of REPLACEMENT WALL .. not ACTUAL NEW EXISTING WALL .. get EDUCATED ... 400 MILLION NEW JOBS .. WHERE / CHINA ?  biggest tax cuts FOR THE RICH .. STOCKS DROWNING .. FARMERS LOSING ..   KEEP TRYING THOUGH !
1080 2019-06-20 16:36:30 Will do.  Maybe they need a few more formal complaints on some of these stocks.
1081 2019-06-20 16:36:03 me: takes one business class and thinks i’m responsible enough to invest in stocks
1082 2019-06-20 16:35:52 HAHAHHAHA they have a quota system prepared already?? thats fucking wild but im also not surprised..... i mean they should have enough stocks prepared la just saying 
1083 2019-06-20 16:35:37 $WORK Many Slack employees, because there was no lock-up and also because they sensed that the debut would not be stellar, sold their shares ahead of time to a secondary marketplace named "Forge".  Sort of a "Ticketmaster" for stocks.
1084 2019-06-20 16:35:30 NEED UNLIMITED STOCKS OF ICE CREAM
1085 2019-06-20 16:35:23 Global stocks climbed to record territory after the US Fed Reserve struck a dovish tone signalling it was ready to cut interest rates to support the economy.
1086 2019-06-20 16:35:15 Coffin and USA flag stocks are going through the roof.
1087 2019-06-20 16:34:57 The same behaviour is seen in Indian index. Nifty50. Only 5-6 stocks has makeup the index to fresh highs
1088 2019-06-20 16:34:56 In a week we'll see: "Stocks rise after Trump/Iran deal"
1089 2019-06-20 16:34:52 #US Stocks: Software $ORCL+7.9%. REIT $VTR+5.1%. Energy $HAL+4.4%. Cruise $NCLH -3.6%. Airline $UAL -2.8%. Pharmacy $CVS -2.6%. Gold $GOLD +6.3%.

1090 2019-06-20 16:33:16 If stocks go down. Then the answer is “No”
1091 2019-06-20 16:33:09 I'm dealing with the stress of potential war by watching the military industrial complex stocks rise and wondering how much I'd have to hate myself to start profiting off all of it.
1092 2019-06-20 16:33:00 Another tech IPO got me 
Thought I was done for now...but I can’t help it. Especially b/c this stock is one I use & value! Don’t fail me SLACK! #work #stocks #investments #NYSE
1093 2019-06-20 16:32:37 Stocks ki group unda ?
1094 2019-06-20 16:31:20 Yea but it didn’t help any of their draft stocks. If you have the choice to go to college, it’s the smarter one in the long run. You can get a quick bag overseas, but if you drop 10 spots in the draft you’re losing a lot more
1095 2019-06-20 16:31:17 What is even more amazing is that stocks went up 35 overnight on news of Iran shooting a drone!
1096 2019-06-20 16:31:08 It’s like USA never drank clear beer, until prohibition was over. 
Quick, mass produced alcohol.
Same thing for soldiers in the trenches. Whisky stocks collapsed, producers held back certain batches they didn’t want diluted. Post WW1, there was a glut. 
Enter: marketing men.
1097 2019-06-20 16:30:08 The Iran thing could be Trump manufacturing another crisis like the Mexico tariffs that he "solves" and then stocks jump.
1098 2019-06-20 16:29:46 Merci quand même, il n'en reste qu'un en plus, je vide les stocks pour manger cet été x) (c'est triste dit comme ça xD )
1099 2019-06-20 16:29:45 I see.

Anyway, another way of replacing the lard used in many Italian meals would be using beef stocks.

don't fry cannoli in beef stocks tho
1100 2019-06-20 16:29:30 He's watching the stocks :)..
1101 2019-06-20 16:29:00 Newly IPO stocks ain't nothing to fuck with
1102 2019-06-20 16:28:46 Let’s hope this brat and his cohorts are caught and given a real lesson and I do mean a real lesson......pity we don’t have the stocks anymore. But what were other pedestrians doing? Nobody tripped  him up or tried to catch and hold him.?
1103 2019-06-20 16:28:31 So what happens to the #market if we retaliate for the drone being shot down? Anything? #Stocks
1104 2019-06-20 16:28:00 He saw MG stocks do Crypto numbers and he gotta act like “no big deal” as he squirms around trying to explain why WU didn’t shoot 150%  but Wonka already knew that 
1105 2019-06-20 16:27:47 @iamrakeshbansal Sir, I always listen to you on zee business and I am v impress with ur style and stocks selection!! Just please convey my msg to Ashu Sir that why he is so n-ve about market that In +ve mkt also he gives sell stks!!
1106 2019-06-20 16:27:40 So bad incoming data, that confirms a rate cut, will push stocks higher. Makes sense!
1107 2019-06-20 16:27:27 Just to be clear 69% of CFO’s expect a recession in the next 12 months as their stocks hit all-time highs
1108 2019-06-20 16:27:21 Bump stocks are banned though you would have to pull her teeth to get her to admit it was Trump that banned them. I have yet seen a firearm kill anyone on it's own let alone a Magazine... I don't think she understands the term Semi Auto.
1109 2019-06-20 16:27:19 Stocks are up almost 50%? Where are you getting your information? That's straight up not true.
1110 2019-06-20 16:27:18 This Drone costs $222 Million dollars. How many Americans could be brought out of abstract poverty. WATCH! They'll buy a new one that'll cost MORE!.

Raytheon Stocks to climb and Trump will brag about that too!
@ChrisWick__
1111 2019-06-20 16:26:40 I didn’t watch. It’s not open to the public right? But i heard that they said no rate cuts in 2019 but in the post conf he double talked & said I guess they are open. You can’t get the truth ever. It’s all orchestrated to confuse us & manipulate stocks just like I always said
1112 2019-06-20 16:26:36 Thanks Mam, had recently started trading index. Hope will do well like I did in stocks.
1113 2019-06-20 16:26:35 Direct indexing (buying 250-500 individual securities that track a custom index) is being touted as the next great thing. I don’t see it. There are tax benefits up front, but there is no exit strategy after tax loss harvesting plays out. You’re stuck with 100s of stocks and fees.
1114 2019-06-20 16:26:27 Before 2009 I seriously considered putting all my assets into cash, taking the cash to a casino and putting it all on red.

ACTUALLY, I witnessed a brilliant problem-solver on the job and WENT ALL IN FOR STOCKS IN MARCH 2009.  My faith was rewarded and my portfolio TRIPLED!
1115 2019-06-20 16:26:26 Little downside flush
Now stocks are supposed to rally 
If they don't, the top argument begins
1116 2019-06-20 16:26:12 Sorry you lost money  ...Maybe you should learn to find stocks yourself. DUH!!

1120 2019-06-20 16:25:05 Try to be short on stocks going more red/hitting new lows & try to be long on stocks going green on the day & hitting new highs. Simple rules like that work again & again & again.
1121 2019-06-20 16:23:57 @realDonaldTrump Since Election Day 2016, Stocks up almost 50%, Stocks gained 9.2 Trillion Dollars in value, and more than 5,000,000 new jobs added to the Economy. @LouDobbs If our opponent had won, there would have been a market crash, plain and simple! @TuckerCarlson
1122 2019-06-20 16:23:25 Stocks into support, if we fail here I will re-evaluate my BTFD stance.
1123 2019-06-20 16:23:22 Fuck you @realDonaldTrump for cutting into my @marketcall with @AndrewBellBNN and @JosefSchachter !!!!   GRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!

Now, say say something stupid to make my stocks go up!!

1126 2019-06-20 16:22:57 Cannot remember the last time I have seen this many stocks all reversing at resistance areas.  name after name all hitting exact resistance support areas and reversing.  One big algo casino.
1127 2019-06-20 16:22:45 $PLNT rejected hard and fast today (one of first to fade).  Possible double top.  Rotation out of safe domestic only stocks now that China back on.  Who knows, but it’s going down.
1128 2019-06-20 16:22:21 Nobody makes you buy or own crappy stocks that are run for benefit of management rather than shareholders. Vote with your dollars, not your proxies and find something better to do with your $. I support the business press trying to do their jobs here but would never own this dog.
1129 2019-06-20 16:22:20 Believe it OR not: May 11, 2019 #Bitcoin was $6,490. Today ONE month later it is $9,400. WHERE can YOU get that kind of Return on your $$? Is it your 401K? Your Stocks? Your BNk?. It’s Crazy to not to be Holding #Bitcoin. Got Bitcoin?
1130 2019-06-20 16:21:57 President Trump reportedly says "You'll soon find out" when asked about any response to situation in Iran. Stocks now:

- Nasdaq up 10.53 
- S&P up 6.13
1131 2019-06-20 16:21:44 I don’t do tech stocks.

1135 2019-06-20 16:20:42 Totally, apparently the key to drawing in angel investors is to just yell about how many Facebook stocks you have
1136 2019-06-20 16:20:39 I just purchased some Slack (WORK) stocks. Today is the first day it started trading on the stock market. 

This stock just keep increasing in price 75 million in volume.

1138 2019-06-20 16:20:07 Stocks are rising you dunce. USD is falling.
1139 2019-06-20 16:19:51 Good websites on stocks?
1140 2019-06-20 16:18:54 He will be right. Stocks are rising and the USD is falling. Yet in the big December selloff, bond yields were rising while stocks crashed. But hey. Get your licks in on Gundlach like 90% of ppl on Twitter.

1143 2019-06-20 16:18:10 I thought stocks were "on track" to close at a record high. What happened?
1144 2019-06-20 16:18:05 Fuck Iran 7,286 trucking companies went out business last month just last month. 2 of which had over 5,000 trucks that's a lot of jobs lost. I voted for you in 2016 but stop lying to people, the economy and the stock market are different. Stocks are only doing well because you're
1145 2019-06-20 16:17:55 Just thought I'd let you know what I've found out so far. As global confidence grows in Britain, we retained our position as the top destination in Europe for foreign direct investment. The country managed to attract £1.48 trillion of inwards investment stocks in 2018
1146 2019-06-20 16:17:49 Stocks believe a Military strike on Iran is imminent... Just as I said would happen is.. stocks initially will pull back (well off the highs right now), and crude higher.
1147 2019-06-20 16:17:44 I have one too and I love him. So easy to cuddle.
1148 2019-06-20 16:17:39 All these defensive stocks being bought, issues with Iran and etc. I hope we’re not going to war... it’s wild we still resort to that.

1151 2019-06-20 16:17:00 I decided to use my proxy vote with stocks I’d acquired- and subsequent purchases- to show up at meetings, write letters, & push for change in the company policy, both on this issue and that of racial discrimination.

1155 2019-06-20 16:15:16 Central bankers may be able to suppress nominal rates, but bondholders will be swindled in real terms in the coming years. 

Gold, real estate, and commodities will outperform stocks and bonds in the coming inflation.  

Allocate accordingly.

1164 2019-06-20 16:13:24 In the UK a many politicians are trying to privatise our NHS, when you look at the politicians many have stocks and stakes in private healthy companies, but look at what the preach about every election cycle, how much they'll support the NHS. Because they know the public love it.
1165 2019-06-20 16:12:40 I worked for them in the 90’s - if you were exposed as being gay- you could be terminated according to their policy. In my position, part of my compensation was in Stocks-  I was “let go” for ‘other’ reasons when another manger found out who I was dating.
1166 2019-06-20 16:12:20 With so many people doubting the Fed, FinTwit criticism, negative investor sentiment, and corps being the only net buyer of stocks in recent years, the real ‘contrarian’ (which so many claim they are) play is bullish equities.  I’m hedging, 52% Net Equity Exposure.
1167 2019-06-20 16:12:00 @BobPisani speculating on "some sort of downturn" this summer. Stocks can fall in front of the FED going back to "emergency levels" in interest rates "just in case"...
1168 2019-06-20 16:11:45 Yes, except many Americans who work are below the poverty line, they work more than one job, they are without health insurance, they have no retirement plan & they do not own stocks. Meanwhile the upper 5% are feeling wealthy, powerful & smug.

1180 2019-06-20 16:07:48 (2 continues) as company stocks were introduced in the world, there were plenty of bad investments. Similarly, experimentation led to LLC and C-corps as the well-structured legal entities we can rely on. With smart contracts, we continue this governance experimentation.

1183 2019-06-20 16:07:22 There is, also, the case that they are defensive stocks and a if you’re truly bullish, you may want to get out. In the end, all that matters is their CF and capacity to pay the dividend so they don’t get whacked.

1194 2019-06-20 16:04:33 It’s a MUST LEARN, if you want to do something besides watch yourself lose money, when your stocks pull back
I trade a LOT of the more complex strategies but, simple Calls n Puts are where it’s at, when trading around your core investments
1195 2019-06-20 16:04:26 I'm still thinking the only explanation for her behavior is that she's in the pee tapes too, but sure, maybe it's stocks.
1196 2019-06-20 16:04:10 It's amazing that big Pharma makes $44 billion off of pediatric vaccines alone!! The MERCK stocks rose 1.3% during this years "measles outbreak". That's a unreal. Just off of fear mongering. SMH
1197 2019-06-20 16:04:03 Regardless of who’s CEO at the end of the day YG owns 16.12% of the stocks. Even if he doesn’t have an official position within the company the amount of stocks that he has makes it so that he has power when it comes to decisions and the direction the company moves.
1198 2019-06-20 16:04:01 We have background checks, domestic abusers already can't own firearms. Safe storage is ineffective and unenforceable.

1200 2019-06-20 16:03:33 Daily circuit limits & order limits r 2 different things. 

In order to limit adhoc price orders in system order price limit is introduced. Order price limit changes as per the price of the stock. 

Circuit filters r there in non FNO stocks. 

Ur case seems of order price limit.
1201 2019-06-20 16:02:37 Right but the income reflects the capacity to purchase the discounted stocks... that was my intent anyway

1203 2019-06-20 16:01:59 When they were receiving the subs they were investing in a diverse range of assets including stocks,property (both investment & revenue) as well as treasuries. The right investments in the right areas would have produced that level of income.
1204 2019-06-20 16:01:55 YG getting a new CEO is blatant mediaplay considering how long that woman has been working for YG and that snake YG still owns all the stocks.
1205 2019-06-20 16:01:23 Okay, but no items, 3 stocks, and we only play on battlefield stages
1206 2019-06-20 16:01:23 one of my gold stocks is up only 2.4%. We need stronger hints of rate cuts, right now.
1207 2019-06-20 16:00:43 They've tried that but these criminals just won't follow the law. Its confusing.

In all seriousness, until the punishment actually fits the crime, we will continue to have never-do-wells who will no deterrence.

Bring back the stocks and the block.

1220 2019-06-20 15:58:56 No. Not playing that game. Remember, this guy is our president and yes, while “they” are laughing, we shouldn’t compound the issue. Just focus on suggesting stocks, bonds, ETF’s and mutual funds.

They are borrowing money to continue paying their dividends since that is the only reason anyone owns their publicly traded stocks.
Thoughts?  Any validity to such logic and reason even if the market doesn't say so?

1286 2019-06-20 15:36:16 @jimcramer  Devil will take your sick soul, that is if you will not stop manipulating stocks on your pathetic @madmoney #show. @CNBC You need psychiatric help. You ate the moron .
1287 2019-06-20 15:35:53 Yes. Crude will rise.. this will push energy and financials higher... stocks will gain. The plan all along. Very sad...
1288 2019-06-20 15:35:43 a good trick to do if you're a rich government official is to expand the federal deficit by giving tax cuts to the rich which boosts stock prices more than it does the economy, then when the economy shows signs of weakness, the fed will lower interest rates, making stocks go up
1289 2019-06-20 15:35:42 My newest D strategy, blame everything bad on Rump. I stub my toe? Fucking Rump. Stocks go down? Bad hair day? All Rump. I mean why not? He sucks
1290 2019-06-20 15:35:16 idk about you but my portfolio is acting a bit draggy with all these headlines about stocks at the highs.

1299 2019-06-20 15:33:25 Ehhh no profit, slowing growth. 26 is high to me. I’d risk more in penny stocks. Too tough to call

1301 2019-06-20 15:32:19 Yup. Most now have to have 2 or 3 jobs to pay for their health care, food and gas for their cars. Markets are up but the majority of people don’t own stocks and live hand to mouth.

1308 2019-06-20 15:30:58 Thinking we may get a quarter end re-balance from bonds to stocks.Maybe mid to late week next week.

1310 2019-06-20 15:30:46 I think it’s bizarre that the whole Trump family, including egg yolk head himself, are allowed to have stocks. He completely swings the market whichever way he wants every day.
1311 2019-06-20 15:30:40 US stocks losing a bit of altitude. S&P 500 14 points off the high
1312 2019-06-20 15:30:29 All of it, probably less w/ DT due to the intense concentration required which makes working on other tasks at the same time impossible. For DT, I prefer index futures as opposed to stocks. They allow for maxing inventory turnover by turning your money over a few times a day

1314 2019-06-20 15:30:07 What is a stock? (Part II) For companies, issuing stock is a way to raise money to grow and invest in their business. For investors, stocks are a way to grow their money and outpace inflation over time #beautyfinance #whenitcomestimoney #investing #educating

1318 2019-06-20 15:29:41 noticed a similar pattern with certain other weed stocks. Important to note what Instinet do on a daily basis as they tend to follow rather than create the trend
1319 2019-06-20 15:29:31 To make money in stocks you must have,

1. Vision to see them.
2. Courage to buy them.
3. Patience to hold them.

Patience is the rarest of the three.

1323 2019-06-20 15:28:22 SO WHAT! That does not HELP the low & middle income or seniors which is 90% of the people in this county who cannot afford to own stocks! This only helps you, your family & your rich friends - the same with the tax cut!

Assess your capital 

Set aside time

Start small

Avoid penny stocks

Time your trades

Cut your losses

Be realistic

Stay cool 
STICK TO THE PLAN

My twitter is about three things 

Mindset 
Motivation 
Money 

Money comes from 

Real Estate
Stocks
Consulting business
E-Commerce
Sports Betting

Don’t limit yourself to 1 thing & always keep an open mind

5 x $100 is greater than 1 x $300
1343 2019-06-20 15:22:31 Who would be delaying them? Us?

They are not going to leave the EU any slower. So we would have to knowingly take ages, and those ages be longer than the time it takes to use up stocks.

Both easily solved.
1344 2019-06-20 15:22:27 $SPY Profit taking currently happening on several stocks this morning and why I sent this out to members, before the market open on our open positions.

1346 2019-06-20 15:22:01 When stocks rise and yields rise it indicates a strong and growing economy. When stocks rise and yields fall we are just trading central bank liquidity..nothing fundamental. We are re-entering the world of massive excess global liquidity and more everything-bubble inflation

1354 2019-06-20 15:19:19 iPhone X, 12.3.1, I restarted and also turned off iCloud sync for the stocks app and turned it back on.
1355 2019-06-20 15:18:49 ça fera double emploi avec le tri sélectif. Par contre faudrait arrêter avec les stocks shots et le ukulele start-up nation. C'est déjà vieillot.

1361 2019-06-20 15:17:15 BFD. Most people are too poor to buy stocks. Also the stock market does not equal the economy.
1362 2019-06-20 15:17:00 Rotation out of financials and into commodity stocks. Seems to be a blind rotation. I can appreciate the move into gold simply on the rate drop, but not too sure about move into economically sensitive steel, aluminum, copper and oil. Feels like maybe algo type is basket trading.

1365 2019-06-20 15:16:13 well, for now nothing on stocks is bearish. Not breadth, not MAs, not large drawdown, new ATH in fact.  SPX is another leading indicator. And obviously technicals are in favour for the time being. If Macro is weak, but Technicals are strong, one waits.

1397 2019-06-20 15:10:22 Smaller/lesser valued stocks will always look like they have moved further because 2% of an $18 stock is less than say 0.4% of a $1900 stock like amazon but the bigger stock is more impactful....
Sorry, boring myself now even

1407 2019-06-20 15:09:22 Market II: Why did the #nasdaq post a follow-through on June 7, and not other major equity indexes? June 4: Day 1 of a new rally attempt, nice gain. June 7: Day 4 of the same new rally attempt, up 1.7% in higher volume vs. the prior day. Classic bottoming action! #stocks #trading

1440 2019-06-20 15:00:16 Probably brokers are asking clients to square up their F&O position (mostly shorts) before last week of month. Stock out of F&O from July. Or else will have to settle trade with physical stocks.
1441 2019-06-20 15:00:11 Not coincidence. Fed cut interest rates last night. All stocks up overnight in the 0.7-0.9% region. There looks like some downside ahead possibly for the stock and I’m sure the LUHG brigade will put that down to themselves despite it being nothing to do with them
1442 2019-06-20 15:00:01 Last week, investors worried about weakness in our interdependent global economy, but optimism around trade wars and rate cuts, plus solid economic data, sent stocks north again.

1454 2019-06-20 14:57:43 Treating MTG cards like stocks has been and always will be happening until the game loses value. To some extent, players should actually welcome this because it adds another dimension to the game and only makes it more popular.

1459 2019-06-20 14:56:12 I don't think it's going to work. Most demand comes from players, not speculators, and players don't want to put in a "bid" and wait around for some seller to agree to their price. You can't treat MTG like stocks because...well, most people that buy Magic cards aren't investing.

1482 2019-06-20 14:52:10 Stocks are up because you borrowed $1.5 TRILLION & gave it to billionaires. They spend it on stocks, not on goods that create jobs. That's why the overall economy is stalling.

How is the claim off by a factor of 16? Stocks vs flows. The total *value* of slaves in 1860 was about 80% of GNP. But that's very different from saying 80% of GNP was "tied" to slavery"

1504 2019-06-20 14:46:29 If you knew how to read, you would see Obama increased stocks by 113% and started a climb for jobs by 2.4% a year during his tenure as president.  It was still in that uphill swing when you stepped in and inherited that.  Just like you inherited everything else your entire life.
1505 2019-06-20 14:46:26 The irony is people compare with FDs when stocks are down and regret returns from FD when there would be spectular stock returns.

1514 2019-06-20 14:41:54 The word was "rarely" -- they are extremely patient, but, as you note, I'm sure they do occasionally sell stocks when the story has clearly changed or the company falters in a major way... they just don't sell often or easily, waiting it out and being "long term" is the brand.
1515 2019-06-20 14:41:22 Yes we know. #BeBest for the rich. Again and again we suffer through this. Other class people are struggling more than ever. Paying more for everything. Losing loads of benefits. Stock market increases don't help those without those stocks...#idiot
1516 2019-06-20 14:41:18 Yay~ two stocks I bought this week already have me double digit returns. I've almost made up my loss for the entire year lol
1517 2019-06-20 14:40:50 Typically how many individual stocks do you hold at any given time?
1518 2019-06-20 14:40:04 Most people don't have stocks
1519 2019-06-20 14:40:00 US Navy drone shot down by Iranian missile over Strait of Hormuz in an unprovoked attack. Stocks give up some gains. 10-yr yield declines to 1.98%, Mortgage Bonds at session highs.
1520 2019-06-20 14:40:00 If you are easily impressed by the illusion of the Dow, you should keep in mind that the return you get over time is about 9%. The big money is in trading individual stocks. I would have never become a stock trader if my expected return was any less than 25-30% per year.

1526 2019-06-20 14:38:34 Nah. Fed announced rate cuts eminent last night, sent stocks higher worldwide. This is inline with the wider S&P (ergo zero impact ).

1549 2019-06-20 14:32:29 I honestly don’t get how we are cutting rates at ATHs and stocks want to keep going higher when bond yields tank. Something doesn’t add up. During previous rate cutting cycles, markets had gone down first justifying a rate cut. Here it’s just the opposite.

1603 2019-06-20 14:17:22 Obama got you here.  Trump didn’t touch it because everything was growing.  Now that he’s playing his tariff game, markets have become more volatile and growth has slowed.  Oh, under Trump, stocks have had the worst year in a decade.

1607 2019-06-20 14:16:03 The popular indexes are making headlines again today, but if you look at the Russell 2000, it's where it was in Nov. 2017.

1615 2019-06-20 14:14:10 Stocks and gold are starting to price a rerun of the 2009 experience when the Fed opened the taps. Just like we discussed last week in relation to the DJIA chart. Whether the market is right is not the issue - you have to take strong signals when they come around.
1616 2019-06-20 14:14:02 Stocks on the rise, thanks Obama. Stocks drop, look what Trump's doing, he's destroying the economy. Stocks rise again, thanks Obama, trump inherited this. Got it.

1619 2019-06-20 14:13:01 OI helps to identify HUGE momentum after #TA Breakouts. Like who watches stocks COI and TA both, may spot trade which are high Volume and/or %movers due to the combined future contract numbers where high, so interest is high, so does liquidity, so does volatility and reaction.

1628 2019-06-20 14:11:49 Democrats have a massive winning issue on wealth inequality and rather than do anything about it, Trump strengthens the issue for them by boosting stocks.
1629 2019-06-20 14:11:37 Some people who trade penny stocks believe the market movers (MMs) will trade 911 shares, which is an incidental amount of shares to signal to other market movers that the company may have news incoming. It's not 100 percent...in my experience it's accurate maybe 75-80 percent
1630 2019-06-20 14:11:15 That’s the War Walrus, if you leave defense stocks out under a plate of cookies with milk on the eve of quarterly earnings reports you’ll wake up to fat dividends.

1636 2019-06-20 14:07:31 Interesting - because literally all of this was happening under your predecessor and stocks were doing even better in terms of growth - and you and @LouDobbs literally never had a good thing to say about it.
1637 2019-06-20 14:06:52 Ok, you know nothing.   You think that stocks and the market are just about the Dow?.  Stick to what you know.
1638 2019-06-20 14:06:46 The world is preparing for a recession. EU announced rate cuts and the Fed hinted at a reduction to soften the blow pushing stocks higher. Your financial and economic illiteracy is stunning. Wharton should rescind the degree your daddy purchased for you.
1639 2019-06-20 14:06:34 Yesterday was definitely a good one. Couple credit lines increased, my stocks are on the rise with record numbers. Let's keep this trend...
1640 2019-06-20 14:06:08 Based on the hope that the FED will cut the rate.  This will increase corporate debt.  Jack up balance sheets.  Let’s build a market bubble of over-priced stocks!

1645 2019-06-20 14:05:49 Hey @doddsie I hope all is good on your end. I want to by my Godson some shares or stocks as a gift for his first christening, do you know if it’s possible or which platform can assist with this?
1646 2019-06-20 14:05:49 Looking at whats coming:
Food prices going up(rain/grain)
Energy prices going up(Iran?)
Wages going up(low unemployment)
Lumber prices up (curtailment)
Big jump in import prices coming?! (tariffs)
Stocks at ALL TIME highs

But "they" want 3 cuts from Powell?
1647 2019-06-20 14:05:30 I have to stop trading stocks in the morning, pre-market rallies always get me excited and it always peters out after the bell #imlearningsomuch
1648 2019-06-20 14:05:28 The last 4 times news came out we saw a 911 trade. I know the last one the news was Monday, but the company stated they tried for Friday. I usually don’t believe the 911 trades on penny stocks, but this seems to hold true with this one. They are making me a believer!
1649 2019-06-20 14:05:16 71.2% in the first two years of the Obama administration, and the 30.8% annualized return bested the historical average by 21.3 percentage points. U.S. stocks gained 21% in the first two years of the Trump administration. That’s some facts for the zombies.
1650 2019-06-20 14:05:08 Whoop De Do!!! That only helps people who have the disposable income to invest in those type of stocks. And it going up doesn’t always mean a good thing. You know NOTHING about finance!!!
1651 2019-06-20 14:04:45 One of your focus list stocks up over 45% in less than 2 weeks after you provided entry pivot less than 2 weeks ago - thank you Kevin!
1652 2019-06-20 14:04:44 During Obama,  stocks increased 150%.
1653 2019-06-20 14:04:43 That’s how I have my 401k set up. I have a 3 tier strategy: index/time managed funds for 401k. DGI and some risk (I’m heavy in cannabis stocks right now) in Roth. Income investing in taxable. It sounds reverse of what they say but I figure having cash can be spent on “fun.”

1659 2019-06-20 14:03:19 Stocks tripled under Obama.
1660 2019-06-20 14:03:16 Stocks are not up 50% no matter how you look at it. When you took office in Jan 2017, the stock market was 19,147. It is fluctuating between 25,000 and 26,000 under you. It was 7,000 when Obama took office. Who had the biggest gain. Obama.  By comparison, U.S. stocks gained...

Bragging how high stock market to people who can’t afford stocks telling plantation owner telling slaves “WE are doing well.” you’re lucky to have me.

1690 2019-06-20 13:59:46 I’m just not a fan of currencies or commodities. Prefer stocks and real estate.
1691 2019-06-20 13:59:38 @BrownieXavier I'm surprised a lot of guys studied Economics & Risk management like us but know nothing about buying stocks. I'm glad we using all the knowledge we got.
1692 2019-06-20 13:59:34 If @AntonKreil  says is gonna be bear market it's gonna be bull market. Just the  opposite of what he says. Like when he give the free advice for GoPro  stocks for Christmas that in the next year it will go up like crazy then  they fail miserably
1693 2019-06-20 13:59:34 Thanks so they could be 100% real estate and stocks?
1694 2019-06-20 13:59:24 I own two growth stocks that trade on prospective earnings multiples that are less than the sales multiples that US larger quoted / private brethren trade on.  Patience - yes. If one in particular executes givens it’s prospective pe is so out of kilter to gross margin, growth etc

1701 2019-06-20 13:57:18 You're not responsible for stocks idiot, this has been happening since Obama pulled the economy out of the ditch. That's all you do well is talk shit and take credit for other people's work and efforts.
1702 2019-06-20 13:56:55 It would be much smarter to just sling the pair of them in stocks in any town centre. Pelt them with rotton fruit and he who cries the least gets the job. Worth a try

1705 2019-06-20 13:56:21 Plus once you have a solid base of core dividend growth stocks, you can start taking some more risks. Just my philosophy. Build the base first then put about 10% into home run swings.
1706 2019-06-20 13:56:18 Same is true for growth stocks - that’s just dollar cost averaging. Just seems a bit risk-averse for people fairly early in their careers.

1712 2019-06-20 13:55:09 The reason US stocks are going up now is because of the possibility of an end to the  #China #tariffs  after the  G20 meeting in Japan. And because of the potential of a rate cut by the #Fed to mitigate the global economic damage brought about by the #Trump #Tradewar.
1713 2019-06-20 13:54:43 The kind of Stocks that have rallied today ..makes my view of a market in bad condition and driven by few people more certain #Sensex #stockmarket

1722 2019-06-20 13:51:21 How would one buy stocks or shares like this
1723 2019-06-20 13:50:58 the bears are too focused on the 2001 and 2007 rate cut cycles. This one is occurring with stocks much closer to highs . It's more similar to 1986 or 1998 with two rate cuts leading to potential blow offs in equity prices. And like 86 a dollar decline and gold rise
1724 2019-06-20 13:50:48 Muahahah. A Comment of absolute conviction (and probably maximum bullish on Pot stocks and crypto to boot)
1725 2019-06-20 13:50:42 People are just talking about Jet moving up 150% , ADAG group stocks moving 25-40% . Spare a thought to the shareholders who are holding these scrips . Do not envy today’s moves — Rather be thankful you are not one  of the shareholders .#JetAirways #ADAG

1727 2019-06-20 13:49:58 The Fed doesn’t play favorites with presidents.  The base rates on economic conditions.  Stocks just carried momentum created by 44’s work because Trump didn’t do anything to screw it up.  Since Tarriff Man started playing is games.  The market has become more volatile and flat
1728 2019-06-20 13:49:28 Grossly over exaggerating!! Stocks have been down for many months and economy will suffer greatly in 2020 and 2021 because of isolation from allies, ignorant tarrifs and self motivated narcissistic decisions. Worst is yet to come
1729 2019-06-20 13:49:08 The Dutch, aided & abetted by French and Spanish, are single-handedly responsible for nearly destroying the fish stocks in UK coastal waters through their use of dragnet & seine net trawlers. They have also had a devastating effect on the UK fishing industry. Good riddance.

1742 2019-06-20 13:46:13 Trump’s bullying of The Fed is dangerous. The Fed MUST not only be independent, but also give the appearance of independence. Chairman Powell’s comments about interest rates “appears” that Trump is wearing him down. Its good for stocks this morning, but the market is a long game.
1743 2019-06-20 13:45:42 Oh look, stocks made a new all time high, and @realDonaldTrump is still the President.. I'd say that looks a lot like #winning to me. #Trump2020 #MAGA #KAG
1744 2019-06-20 13:45:28 Rising bond prices, falling commodity prices and a rising dollar are classic symptoms of excess demand for dollar cash. Stock prices seem precipitously high because bond prices are precipitously high. ETFs make it easy to short bonds & stocks if you seriously doubt their value.

1746 2019-06-20 13:45:10 So why was #rockwellmedical stock offering priced 32% below current PPS. Simply supply & demand. Increased supply with decreasing demand = lower price.

1757 2019-06-20 13:40:47 When you can't tax people, and become elected, you have to resort to hidden tax strategies to address the bloat.  Option premiums on stocks > 30%/year, borrow @ basically 0%, long way to go.  Financial engineering, high act. stock valuations force retail to the options casino.
1758 2019-06-20 13:40:46 CONGRATULATIONS! This morning the DJIA finally broke it's high from January 26, 2018! That means that if you bought stocks a year and 5 months ago, today is the first day you haven't lost money (except for the effect of Inflation which means you have still lost money.)

1771 2019-06-20 13:37:35 He'll still be right. Look at this thread. Talk about being on one side of the boat. And the funny thing, stocks are rallying with bonds.
1772 2019-06-20 13:37:35 I would appreciate if you can show some productivity n results instead of beating around the bush on calls n emails and over social media. I cannot see results. Also, You are selling refurbished product to clear your stocks
1773 2019-06-20 13:37:22 @taydsfb can I ask the board what recommendations they are putting forward for the 2020 season regarding full C&R on all the Tay tributary and of course the Tay.  Will it go to a Cat 3 or will the board make the decision to go full C&R to help the spawning stocks on their system.
1774 2019-06-20 13:37:08 Stocks down
1775 2019-06-20 13:36:57 You got it wrong.  Stocks do not mean anything to NGDP - now when I am right with plunge and stocks return to NGDP econ, with vol finishing vol regime jump to 25% do you eat humble pie.  Have been wrong for 5 years now, yet convinced I am "right" - the reality of t^2 will be wild
1776 2019-06-20 13:36:57 My stocks been on fire these last 2 days 
1777 2019-06-20 13:36:51 Well since stocks don’t help the average American at all, and your jobs number is a lie, and Lou can’t really predict what might have happened under a more stable administration, I’d say that you should probably just resign!
1778 2019-06-20 13:36:51 With stocks at all time highs, there is no incentive for Trump to end the trade war

1796 2019-06-20 13:29:51 Tja, hvis vi ser bort i fra trading i seg selv, så er det kjedelig å tape porteføjeverdi pga valuta. Ikke moro å ha mine NOKs i US stocks i dag, ned 1.5% før børsen har åpnet. I Q4 var det SEk som var slem.

1811 2019-06-20 13:25:17 Sure it is, because of the tax cuts you gave big companies who bought back stocks instead of raising wages for their workers. You know, the workers who can't even afford to buy stocks because they can hardly afford to buy food! The only people you help are rich people.
1812 2019-06-20 13:25:16 I read the update should I buy I had to sell my stocks because of an emergency and I don't own it right know.
1813 2019-06-20 13:25:09 I suggest everyone who trade In stocks to move your accounts to some other company rather these crooks who are charging £24 every quarter of not trading @IGcom , @IGClientHelp
1814 2019-06-20 13:24:50 i work full shift tomorrow so im just gonna tip my sis to buy bt21 uniqlo shirt for me. i hope stocks are still available by night 
1815 2019-06-20 13:24:04 Also you know what's not so crazy??? 

Stocks went up usually since then.
1816 2019-06-20 13:22:57 Playing in Europe could help raise his stocks... so go
1817 2019-06-20 13:22:56 Okay. Haven't tracked intraday OI in a while; so I probably led you on a tangent of an academic conversation.
 
I wish we could get historical OI change data, even if every 30 minutes or so (like stocks), that would've been very helpful in pattern analysis.
1818 2019-06-20 13:22:51 $SPX I’m an not sure why plebs think negative rates are good… esp good for stocks… There will be a generation of pension fund retirees who will get nothing but pain as their fund mgrs chase Central Bank tomfoolery ...

1820 2019-06-20 13:22:03 Absolutely foolish to even consider talks for him before U21 Euro ends, his stocks about to shootup
1821 2019-06-20 13:21:51 Speaking of dubious double standards, explain to me how it was Sanders was able to pay a 13.5% tax rate on income that put him in the 28% tax bracket. Did having three properties and a shitload of stocks have anything to do with it? Yes, Sanders is the king of double standards.
1822 2019-06-20 13:21:33 stick to few stocks thats it ... 

i know many successful traders who only stick to few quality stock + indices .. thats enough for life time

1824 2019-06-20 13:21:24 Also.. what are your views on recently falling hard but today's Hero stocks like Indiabulls, PEL and Maruti ? First two are often named as casino stocks 
1825 2019-06-20 13:21:08 In contrast to this great economy is the Obama Economy.  Did you know that under Obama stocks only increased by 75%?  75% .. that's nothing compared to 50%.
That's ONLY 25% more than 50%  How wants 25% more than %50% when you can have 50%!!
1826 2019-06-20 13:21:04 Who cares about the stock market? Not your average American - they are living glom payday to payday, with no money to invest in stocks. And the new jobs are minimum wage (or less) that require anybody to work 2 or more jobs to even exist!
1827 2019-06-20 13:20:54 The average person doesn’t care about stocks, they’re living paycheck to paycheck.
Minimum wage is stagnant...people are working 2-3 jobs to keep from drowning.
Trickle down economics doesn’t work.
But, trickle down stressonomics does...your daily gaslighting sucks as much as you

1831 2019-06-20 13:19:21 Trust your gut to make trade decisions?

Sure day's leading up the the Fed announcement like yesterday can be trying, especially if your perception is that your stocks where going down.
1832 2019-06-20 13:19:16 yeah, and the economy is a euphemism for rich people's stocks.
1833 2019-06-20 13:18:55 In my view, Rewards/risks ratio have been always high in both Index and stocks on this platform in prospective of  either market is going down or up. Amazing work out by you..Best employment here in unemployment condition if anyone is.. All the best for future endeavor....

1835 2019-06-20 13:18:31 In a world where you allocate money between bonds and stocks, the lower the bond yield the more equities are worth. This is the fed valuation model from the 90s.

1846 2019-06-20 13:15:11 Via @biancoresearch the first cut in 95 was with the stock at a new ATH. In 89 the stock market was only 1% off ATH. 07 and 01 saw the first cuts when stocks were 6% and 7% off ATH, respectively. Facts over outrage QTR

1868 2019-06-20 13:07:20 Being long with the markets so distorted thanks to the Fed is one of the hardest things to do. 

It’s obvious the economy is slowing down. 

The Fed wouldn’t be doing something so stupid if it wasn’t.  Stocks are ATH’s and unemployment at record lows.....

1872 2019-06-20 13:06:10 Between you & Lou Dobbs who is more senile? Stocks are owned by the rich not the poor or middle class. Where are those jobs? You inherited a very strong economy so go somewhere else with your BS.
1873 2019-06-20 13:06:03 So @jimcramer just said “these feel like parabolic moves...they don’t end well” in reference to all tech stocks moving up without news and in the face of trade wars and potential rate cuts. 

@davidfaber just said it feels like it’s the end of “the cycle”

1878 2019-06-20 13:05:13 Looks like we're going to have a strong open. Everything is up (stocks, bonds, oil, dollar). Not exactly sure what the catalyst. Only news really is more dovish central bank talk (BOJ, BOK, RBA), weak Philly Fed, and strong jobless claims

Once again you’re talking to the elite 1% who have 99% of the wealth, you don’t care about the common working man.
1889 2019-06-20 13:03:16 Worried about the World ending in 12 years due to Climate Change ? Just get stoned dude. All your worries fade man. Buy the Cannabis stocks bro. Lambo soon. #ClimateEmergency

1891 2019-06-20 13:02:48 I remember stories my grandmother told me about the cod fisherman in denial about the decline in stocks. Either we look the facts in the face or delude ourselves. Either way adjustments will need to be made, even if we completely stop CO2 emissions we've passed the tipping point
1892 2019-06-20 13:02:46 Thank you President Trump for sticking to your promises. Not only are stocks up and more jobs created but the pipeline is being built along with the boarder wall. Keep up the good work & fight the good fight.

1901 2019-06-20 13:00:53 So may people calling for bullish market and $SPY NOW, hahaha none of them were bullish few weeks ago, therefore it’s clear that many are now stuck chasing without true plans.

1911 2019-06-20 12:58:41 Well the stocks did rise a bit up again with he as the new CEO haha and they did announce a comeback of one of their solo artists so I think they'll take baby steps mby also wait to see what will happen when Seunghyun is back (bc sadly there will be drama like rn..)
1912 2019-06-20 12:58:35 Well sir considering I have a relative massive bag of gold, silver, and mining stocks. #blessed 
1913 2019-06-20 12:58:35 maybe, jay @federalreserve, you need to clue in your "very special friends" to close up some of the naked shorts they've got in $gold $silver stocks? the losses there look to be even bigger than in the futures markets....

1915 2019-06-20 12:57:39 My interest rate is 3.2%. I’m better off buying stocks, ETFs or CEFs that pay a monthly dividend of 6-10% and and reinvesting the dividends into buying more shares.

1917 2019-06-20 12:56:30 So I guess this counts as some follow through. Bonds and stocks are still in the same post 08 trend though. So what this means I don't know

1919 2019-06-20 12:56:27 @Georgeatasda is there any way of finding out which store stocks a particular dress?
1920 2019-06-20 12:55:29 Well exactly GreekFire. I am bullish on new economy stocks b/c they have long-lived (expected) robust cash flows. I know that w/ global indebtedness, CBs have no choice but to lower rates, discounting those cash flows at lower levels. Wrld growth will remain challenged!

1922 2019-06-20 12:54:52 Engineering a farm produce deflation to claim lower headline inflation is self-defeating.

1925 2019-06-20 12:54:13 Remember after the DOT com bulle CNBC would ask guests if they had an interest in the company.  After they let guests pump stocks until the market exploded @jimcramer @andrewrsorkin @BeckyQuick @michaelsantoli @carlquintanilla @davidfaber @WilfredFrost @cnbc @SquawkCNBC
1926 2019-06-20 12:53:41 Of the two I believe that $MLNT will be the more stable of the two due to the high short float. $EDSA Low float. I could run but higher risk.

1927 2019-06-20 12:53:39 With money so cheap and so much not in stocks, I think that if the trade issues resolve this year and the economy boots up for the 2020 election, we'll probably see DOW 30k+ before the next bottom falls out. Do you think that is possible?

1930 2019-06-20 12:52:35 I understand your point! In case of this tool, we aiming kinda the opposite - recreating of the real world (opposite to what photo stocks can offer usually). Though, of course, people will use it the way they want.

1959 2019-06-20 12:44:24 The depends which way you measure inflation.  If you look to bonds, stocks, and real estate, inflation is sky high.  When the bond market starts getting dominated by QE, where will people put their money?  Time will tell.  This is a big experiment where no one knows the outcome.

1968 2019-06-20 12:42:16 Since @realDonaldTrump took over the economy it has been flat to down. Go back to January 2018 when his economy takes over. Stocks flat. Jobs flat. Inequality bigger. World standing smaller. Recession on the horizon. Middle class smaller. Planet destroyed. Your stats are BS.

1993 2019-06-20 12:38:20 As for stocks only 54 Americans own them, with the top 1 percent owning a disproportionate amount of them.

1995 2019-06-20 12:38:18 When the market is being driven by optional things that may happen in the future, it's being driven by options and futures.  Which can be marked to zero. Options and futures expire today and tomorrow. Beware surging stocks during expirations.

2016 2019-06-20 12:32:19 Another lie. Chart shows stocks up 39% during Trump’s first 27 months. Stocks were up 60% during Obama’s first 27 months.   Chart doesn’t lie.
2017 2019-06-20 12:32:16 Gold up $40.. Fangs set to gap up big.. futures saying 100% chance of  fed rate cut in july.....using trailing stops,....,just like last summer....stocks printing money.. iran downs American drone.. recall..tweet about collapsing iran economy

2019 2019-06-20 12:32:06 Sir abhi you many Rs100 and Rs200 stocks are down close to 100%.
2020 2019-06-20 12:31:54 I was waiting for Ron to weigh in on this. Now ask him what stocks I should buy.
2021 2019-06-20 12:31:43 No, I’ve evolved and added a Moving Average component. Boxes are great but I realized that stocks can begin moving earlier.  Now I have two-stage signaling:
1) a MA “cheater signal”
2) normal Box buy signal

More options: can start small at 1, add at 2 etc. Better choices

2032 2019-06-20 12:27:40 I think I’m heading to Erie area to visit in laws this summer. I’ll hit you up when I do. Maybe we can grab a beer and talk strategy/stocks.
2033 2019-06-20 12:27:37 10s-2s treasuries is 20bp from inversion because economy is is tanking. Stocks spiking up because it seems ok for now.

2035 2019-06-20 12:27:27 Thoughts on digital AGMs as well?  A few companies have done this, but the legal / regulatory end of things can be on the costly / prohibitive side for small stocks.  Personally I'm very much in favour - opens up management access to the broader, outside-of-London pool.

2038 2019-06-20 12:27:09 What about the fact that for 100 years stock real returns have been 5%.  So if you get 1% inflation then stock returns are about 6%.  Or of inflation is about 3% then returns have been about 8%.   I think I would be overweight stocks for the long term unless bond yield far better

2041 2019-06-20 12:26:13 Probably not going to short $XME, I just like watching it to get some feel for how rates are affecting commodities. The gold stocks sometimes skew that ETF away from industrial steel, aluminum and copper. If I was going to short I'd probably go $X $AA $FCX, but just watching.
2042 2019-06-20 12:25:31 Stay stoned bro. Buy Canadian Cannabis stocks man. To the moon baby.
2043 2019-06-20 12:25:14 I was also told that Trump is a misogynist and an anti Semite. Meanwhile he has more woman in his administration then ever before , and he has fully supported Israel..so yeah. No I didn't sell my stocks .I bought more.
2044 2019-06-20 12:25:06 Stocks are not up almost 50% since  2016.

Hard to own stocks when you live in welfare states.
2057 2019-06-20 12:20:53 Pretty shocking how low the UK's fallen. David Cameron needs stringing up or putting in the stocks as he's the arsehole that kicked this disaster off. Funny how quiet he's gone recently.
2058 2019-06-20 12:20:24 Since Election Day 2016, Stocks up almost 50%, Stocks gained 9.2 Trillion dollars in value and more than 5,000,000 new jobs added to the Economy. @LouDobbs if our opponent had won, there would have been a market crash plain and simple. @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity @IngrahamAngle.
2059 2019-06-20 12:19:45 Any thoughts on gold this morning? I can't find any stocks that are a decent value. if the Fed is going to destroy the currency, I want to keep an eye on gold which I've never owned in the past

2063 2019-06-20 12:19:21 oil well.. Trump wants that war. If it gets dragged out then he doesn't need votes to win. when at war he stays in power. Talked about risk premium after ships bombed. highly likely this escalates rapidly.
Gold-risk premium stocks - lower dollar cheaper exports.
2064 2019-06-20 12:19:11 It’s not all clear yet for stocks. Need to see more than a marginal breakout. No one should celebrate yet.
2065 2019-06-20 12:18:33 90+% of all stocks owned are owned by < 10% of the people who trade them. It’s an old boys club and not an economic indicator. You’d think the president would know that !!
2066 2019-06-20 12:18:18 And your evidence that the market would have crashed if Hillary had won is?  So not one single piece of evidence backs you up on this stupid statement.  FACT: stocks & jobs gained at a higher rate under Obama and the economy was at it's highest in 10 years before you!
2067 2019-06-20 12:17:40 this is going to be a very "exciting day" for all those who follow @federalreserve's lead and short $gold $silver stocks.....going to have some "religious" moments.....

So how is @AfriAgPLC going to be any different,i am interested in Cannabis stocks but not so impressed by the performance of them
2069 2019-06-20 12:17:20 So should we buy stocks or not?
2070 2019-06-20 12:17:16 It's on my monitor but I'm not keen on it. I used smallcappick as a good indicator to avoid stocks he spams and he was all over DEV on the forums not long ago at 6.5p. In all fairness I do not know much about it, will have a closer look at it later.

2074 2019-06-20 12:16:49 The Bullish Percent Index for gold mining stocks has recently moved above 50, suggesting the possibility that this is an industry-wide thrust. Over last 7 years, only two big thrusts in the BPI above the 50 percent level.

2076 2019-06-20 12:16:42 Buying stocks means buying ownership into the company. You can do this yourself or go through a trader.

While Jupiter/Neptune "justifies" current market euphoria, this builds in perfection.
We locked in/took trading Gold & Silver profits although precious metal stocks have more to run in H2 2019.
Without warlike scenarios, we see US bonds overextended

2081 2019-06-20 12:15:11 $edsa what a move  up $6.25 on fda saying they can start phase 2? really interesting times in the market right about now, reminds me of how stocks traded in late 90's before the dot com crash
2082 2019-06-20 12:14:57 Might be of interest to some in the UK:
Our local Sainsburys now stocks a range of "Hi Five" ready-meals.
Vegan, *plausibly* claims 5 portions of veg in each pack, not as tasty as home-made but pretty d*mn good for ready-meals.
Would recommend if you can afford £3/meal/person.
2083 2019-06-20 12:14:53 Stop trying to rewrite history... the crash happened when a Republican was in office.  It recovered under Obama.  The upward trend upon/since election was a continuation of the upward trend happening under Obama.  Stocks have plummeted more then once under you.
2084 2019-06-20 12:14:36 My 90% investment is in these stocks 
2085 2019-06-20 12:14:32 Also this is like those demerger of Talvalkar or Omkar style.. Suggest retail to stay away. Better value available in safer stocks in this market

2087 2019-06-20 12:14:12 What? Stocks are not up 50% since he allowed the biggest companies to pay zero taxes. All you have is a trillion added to the debt so far
2088 2019-06-20 12:13:35 I have a similar approach. But last bitcoin bear market I made myself buying it regardless. I did read about bitcoin and its underlying strength. Although we can't give it a exact price in the same way we can value stocks and other assets. It was probably the cheapest and most
2089 2019-06-20 12:13:27 What do you mean by 'mispricing'? There is  good reason for Stocks to go down. Good companies are going down because they have large international operations and supply chain which is being hurt by the Trade War which is also creating a lot of uncertainty

As for selling. I try not to sell for as long as story holds. If 3 years results are poor (not merely flat) & trending down, THEN i might sell.

2119 2019-06-20 12:04:40 The problem, of course, being that from his inauguration to 2018, he was just riding Obama's coattails.  A president can't change the economic outlook that quickly.  Once we hit the actual Trump economic years, the stocks bounce up and down like a kid on a trampoline.
2120 2019-06-20 12:04:31 That's part of it, yes. One reason I warmed to gold last summer (long before #Fed started kicking around cuts) was expectation of higher vol & increasing divergences in stocks (many sectors not keeping up with $SPX, non-confirms in corp. bond spreads of new SPX highs, etc.)
2121 2019-06-20 12:04:17 the economy is stocks
2122 2019-06-20 12:03:24 Alamanda. The stocks also will depend on how big the store is
2123 2019-06-20 12:03:10 investing in stocks was the best decision I have ever made four years ago.
2124 2019-06-20 12:03:00 The only play on stocks is long or sidelined.

2126 2019-06-20 12:01:47 What do you define as "Stocks"? If it's the Dow Jones, "Stocks" are +33% since Inauguration Day. For the same period under Obama (who inherited the Great Recession), Dow Jones was +51%. Obama created 7M jobs in the 31 months before Election Day. You've created 5M. #NotKeepingUp
2127 2019-06-20 12:01:33 Being a consistently profitable trader over the long haul is all about execution.  Anyone can watch stocks and "call" trades but that doesn't pay the bills.  Find your process.  #DayTrading $MLNT

2134 2019-06-20 11:58:50 The middle-class workers who can't withstand a $400 surprise don't care about increases in the stock market. The only stocks they own are in a small 401k.

That's all good and fine for your 1% cronies, but it doesn't do the average man any good at all.

2136 2019-06-20 11:58:34 Colion, we, the gun community love you, and you know that, but its time for the #NRA to get off their padded asses and fight. They rolled over for bump stocks and red flag laws. What's next? #GOA is our only TRUE advocate at this point.
2137 2019-06-20 11:58:21 1- Nobody except stock traders care about stocks
2- Obama / Clinton created way more jobs than that
3- Trumps economy consists of adding trillions onto the deficit
     and cutting regulations vital to peoples health and the environment
     hardly good governing
2138 2019-06-20 11:58:19 I agree with you Jeff, they should raise rates! Cutting them now, may help stocks in the short term, but will eventually kill them in the long run! Unfortunately, foregone conclusion they will cut in July

2150 2019-06-20 11:54:47 The slumping stocks issue is debatable, given the move in equities over past few days.

Many people spend the dividends from stocks but if u have another source of income u SHOULD reinvest! 

Simple this - 
PF - 1cr 
Dividend - 50k (reinvested) 
Ann. growth in dividend - 10%
Time - 20 years 
PF CAGR - 15%

20 years later u get back 1.1cr!! 

Magic!

2214 2019-06-20 11:33:08 @JoeSquawk can you ask your guest if he would agree part of the reason for the market multiple expansion is related to the excess liquidity chasing fewer stocks.  Russell 5000 has 3500 stocks as an example.

2225 2019-06-20 11:29:03 Near bankruptcy, all stocks are penny stocks and have price movements similar to options (so leveraged). E.g. a 150% increase in stock value may not be anything more than a 3-4% reassessment of enterprise value in restructuring etc. The market must know something's up.

2249 2019-06-20 11:13:41 Yeah yield curve inversion doesn't help much with timing, only indicator  to be cautious. Fed starts lowering interest rates and stocks rally.  Most recession market corrections have been near all time highs

2260 2019-06-20 11:09:18 That -28% is a good step in the right direction, but 100 pounds of beef per year (1/4 lb per day) is still too much. That 0.25 lb of beef requires cows be fed 2.6 lbs of soy and corn, plus 4.8 lbs of grasses and other crops. Eating 0.25 lb of beef triples our GHG footprint.

2262 2019-06-20 11:07:58 Indeed, so because 'stock' may refer to different things (e.g. harvested biomass vs managed unit), definitions are important. Also see multispecies stocks! Take home message is that 'stock' not really used term in biology, so better avoided in that field. Rather use 'population'.

2264 2019-06-20 11:07:07 Over 80% of stocks are held by the 10% of the wealthiest people in America. Unless you believe in trickledown economics you are doing nothing for the middle class and those in poverty.

2285 2019-06-20 10:57:07 Most of the time common stocks are subject to irrational and excessive  price fluctuations in both directions as the consequence of the  ingrained tendency of most people to speculate or gamble... to give way  to hope, fear and greed. Quote by B. Graham
2286 2019-06-20 10:55:20 Happy Thursday! Futures pointing to a solid open as it looks like stocks are getting an extended Fed lift this morning. And the 10-year US Treasury yield briefly dipped below 2%.

2290 2019-06-20 10:52:22 That’s not what investors do. Investors “invest” in companies with insufficient funds to make a product. Xbox is Microsoft so it is extremely unlikely they would need investors. Yes I know what I’m talking about. There are people/organizations that but stocks though. 
2291 2019-06-20 10:52:18 Is this the platform that treats players like stock? Where does the stock come from? Is it completely fabricated and is like gambling or are there tangible stocks that you are actually buying and selling?
2292 2019-06-20 10:51:50 good tips!
2293 2019-06-20 10:51:42 My two cents: there’s going to be a “cosmetic” #trade deal between #Trump and #Xi because Trump needs it for his re-election. #Tariffs will be removed, vague promises made. #Stocks will rise. That’s ultimately what Trump needs. Xi has all the time he wants. And the winner is...
2294 2019-06-20 10:51:35 Tim saw you early this morning. Yeoman service! I love Karen, Millissa, Guy & you. Great show. My question is with most stocks at or near 52 wk highs, what do small investors have to invest in, especially with talk of recession?

2313 2019-06-20 10:44:53 There is a lot more volatility in ASX 200 stocks than the indicators are suggesting, due to the decrepit market cap bias these indicators have.
2314 2019-06-20 10:44:50 1K free money per month:

The poor spend on food, drugs, lottery, alcohol & rent.

Middle class use it for RE mortgage.

Rich invest it in stocks, bonds and rental property.

At the end of 5 years, more dead addicts, rents higher, RE higher, stocks higher and the rich are richer.

2332 2019-06-20 10:30:46 Wondering...

When you don’t understand why the market is irrational, ask yourself this question::

If almost 95% of the people doesn’t get stocks…. what is the % of the people that gets crypto?

2335 2019-06-20 10:28:14 Notice how he starts the clock on Barack Obama's watch? That's because his own record is a LOT less impressive. Trump's first budget and signature tax plan weren't implemented until late 2017. Since then, stocks have been relatively flat. #Loser

The Euro STOXX 600 rose 0.66 per cent in early trading and Wall Street futures indicated US stocks were set to open higher.
2350 2019-06-20 10:22:10 In my honest opinion , these stocks are not meant to be traded by smaller retail with sub 10-25lac accounts . Much bigger players operate these stocks and if you get caught on wrong foot, you will get killed.

2355 2019-06-20 10:19:10 In fact, Retail Investors should not touch these stocks..Everyone talking about 90 percent jump in Jet airways and how about the free fall from 250 to 45-50 .. percentage hardly matters from lower level , damage has been done.

2361 2019-06-20 10:14:49 Great chart, traditionally coke follows  iron and a few out there are taking up a few coal stocks. People need to beware that the iron supply is effected by the tailings issues in South America.
2362 2019-06-20 10:14:45 Funny markets, the (supposed) bad stocks make the whole market nosedive and when they go up the (supposed) good stocks ain't recovering from their fall.
2363 2019-06-20 10:13:49 Nigel,
Retail Investors have no business to be in these stocks.
I know some of them chase beaten down stocks but most of them also land up loosing money.

2368 2019-06-20 10:11:15 At this point it’s looking like a play to lower the price of stocks. Cause it seems a lot of this shit could’ve been cleared up yrs ago if people weren’t playing dirty.
2369 2019-06-20 10:11:02 Wonder how many of your base own stocks... Hope they do so they got something out of it... Hope they are smart to exit the stock at the right time, otherwise they are left with less than nothing...

2382 2019-06-20 10:06:24 I wouldn't say we're making less. That bonus we lost was only 4-8% of our monthly paychecks before taxes, and most of the time, we only got 4%. I got to keep my stocks, so I didn't lose much there. With the pay increase, I made about $200 extra/month.

2421 2019-06-20 09:53:35 The big question is “ why Ripple bought Moneygram stocks at 4.10$/share” when 1day before the price closed at ~1.44$ ????
2422 2019-06-20 09:53:26 Look at the correlation between yields and stocks as an indication for the health of the financial system. When stocks rise and yields rise it indicates a strong and growing economy. When stocks rise and yields fall we are just trading central bank liquidity..nothing fundamental

2493 2019-06-20 09:17:32 Market truth :-

During good times - Quality stocks will go up
During Bad times - Quality stocks will still go up

Though the dead cats are bouncing back, never go to the same route that has given us permanent scars.

2503 2019-06-20 09:13:29 There is multiple avenues to become wealthy.

Starting a business, buying rental properties, investing in stocks, working in a high income profession for years, etc.

But there is 1 common trend among all people who become wealthy: they spend less than they earn.

2515 2019-06-20 09:06:10 Wow, $XAU / Gold broke out overnight. Impressive breakout of a resistance for 3 years straight. 

Mainly watching Silver as well here, seems an incredible buy for long term portfolio.

Also watching;
Uranium companies/stocks
Platinum futures

2518 2019-06-20 09:03:26 we should remember the fact that YG still has the majority of stocks. i hope he understands he f*cked up big time and finally takes a step back.
2519 2019-06-20 09:02:51 Si la France va mal, elle reste la mieux lotie en EU. L’armée allemande est en lambeaux. Elle manque de tout. Il faudrait au bas mot, 20 M. d’EUR juste pour les stocks de munitions. Et des groupes électrogènes, puisque les groupes diesels sont remisés, sont pas Euro 6.
2520 2019-06-20 09:02:25 No production firearm is perfect out of the box. There are always room for improvements with after market parts. Especially grips, triggers, and stocks. What makes so sense is why so many excellent (and expensive) firearms come with such shitty charging handles.

2525 2019-06-20 08:59:03 Yes. Totally. All these HRTIHIK stocks are purely being manipulated. Look at the index. Just refuses to go down because of these stocks.

2527 2019-06-20 08:57:49 At least two centers of power benefit from the current tension between the US and Iran: The White House and the Iranian regime.

Also, if you have zero conscience, this is the time to buy stocks in the arms industry.
2528 2019-06-20 08:57:22 Totally agree. Or just do a simple cash offer of the projected 5.75 CAD on the $kblt stocks.  Then it's also easier for other interested parties to raise the bid.
I hope mgmt. is proud of themselves when they look in the mirror every morning.

2531 2019-06-20 08:56:02 It doesn’t matter if there’s a new CEO. YG and his brother own a large amount of stocks, meaning they can still make decisions behind the scenes.
2532 2019-06-20 08:55:22 Today I would buy #uranium miners stocks. And probably in the future some #nickel #cooper and #gold miners stocks.
2533 2019-06-20 08:53:43 Looking very nice to me. Always have had every faith in JB. Still a long 3 year journey ahead and very happy to see where it leads.

I never tell anyone how to farm, because I don’t know their soil types, resources, age, weeds, drainage etc because most farmers that are still doing it are bloody good at it & they know what works & what doesn’t.

2559 2019-06-20 08:43:03 Since Election Day 2016, Stocks up almost 50%, Stocks gained 9.2 Trillion Dollars in value, and more than 5,000,000 new jobs added to the Economy.
2560 2019-06-20 08:42:51 Buy and hold and then buy more on substantial declines - works!
Trick is not to buy on the way up. Wait for stocks to falter and fall steepish, then add more.

2562 2019-06-20 08:42:23 I’m sorry, but if that’s Australia’s list of ‘stocks to watch’, then we’re in deep trouble.  Two mining companies, an oil company, a toll road operator and a retailer who fights a rearguard battle against an online presence.

2573 2019-06-20 08:34:46 That study's estimates are at the higher end of the spectrum.

Falco takes 8 stocks in an iron Man Vs @GG_SSBM, Marth takes one.

It's gonna be a long road...
2616 2019-06-20 08:19:01 I won’t
2617 2019-06-20 08:17:59 "Buying for Long term" has become a myth now with Nifty Stocks falling 30% in a day or 70% in a month Where will the investors find the Confidence to put their money?
2618 2019-06-20 08:17:10 Yeah but most of what ruminants eat is agricultural waste, grass and other stuff indigestible to humans
2619 2019-06-20 08:15:59 When I started trading few months ago...I used to keep it ON and whatever stocks they said...I would chase and take delivery at high price...by third day I realised itna aasaan hota toh sab paise banaate...that was it. 
2620 2019-06-20 08:15:50 Nope. We need to stop driving so much AND we need to eat less beef AND we need to switch to carbon-neutral electricity. If we don't do all of those things, it will get 4C hotter and there will be widespread famine, flooding, and migrations. Hundreds of millions will probably die.
2621 2019-06-20 08:15:11 Biden also looks longingly on his work with George Bush 1 and all the people they locked up for victimless crimes so they could make money buying prison stocks.
2622 2019-06-20 08:15:03 Ssshhh.... here comes a secret: buy WesternUnion stocks now.... and thank me in 4 weeks 
2623 2019-06-20 08:14:42 Hit them where it hurts most. Sell their stocks if you own them, don't go to games, don't buy their stuff. Skip their sponsors stuff as well..then see the impact of #GlazersOut
2624 2019-06-20 08:14:33 Holding three longs with room for a fourth or force-feed it into the other three. We must always capitalize on a post-correction rally. These present the best and most powerful opportunities for profit #stocks
2625 2019-06-20 08:14:18 Sp500 heading to 4000 given instos are so long cash, bonds and defensive stocks
2626 2019-06-20 08:13:39 Perhaps the format needs a reboot: stocks, imprison, exile.
2627 2019-06-20 08:13:18 Zirp needs stocks lower to initiate. So first $150 then $420.
2628 2019-06-20 08:13:15 "...Kitu Sewer-Mashifta album inauzwa kwa maduka zote - tangu ninunue ina ni keep busy; hurry while stocks last. Bei ya kutupa."
2629 2019-06-20 08:12:23 @BBCNormanS - why aren't you mentioning anything about the next financial crash that's coming? Stocks and shares have reached their end - this is part of the whole problem with this country - keep it quiet while the wealthy cream off whatever's going.
2630 2019-06-20 08:11:30 @JMJalel_H could probably give more value but as far as I'm aware the Libya links are nowhere near what they used to be. 

From the release though you can see leakage and proliferation of Libyan arms from Gaddaffi stocks.
2631 2019-06-20 08:09:03 Sharp fall in market takes 1 by surprise BUT isn't too painful. A slow fall is more painful as u tend to pour in cash for averaging. However a slow fall only in small/mid caps along with rise in select index stocks is too painful for investors who start believing they are victims
2632 2019-06-20 08:08:50 But stocks in Asia were higher with Nikkei up 0.6% and China rising 2.5%. The USD has fallen steeply and USDJPY is trading at 107.50 and this capped the Nikkei.

2634 2019-06-20 08:07:51 Morning all.. The markets reacted strongly to the Fed's dovish tone with the big moves in bonds and gold, both of which rallied strongly with gold at 6yr highs. We also saw a rally in stocks with S&P closing up just 0.3% and NASDAQ up 0.4%.
2635 2019-06-20 08:07:49 Making food is great, but it should be done as efficiently as possible, and without generating GHGs that are 28x to 300x more potent than CO2. Cows are not efficient, and they also generate both CH4 and N2O.

2640 2019-06-20 08:05:03 Hi,
A great summary. One exhibit shows MACD as a leading indicator and another exhibit shows MACD as a lagging indicator. Would you clarify what is it?
2641 2019-06-20 08:04:58 Using natural gas in the Haber Process to form ammonia for fertilizer is NOT recycling CO2.

Generating methane from cellulose is also NOT recycling CO2.

Generating N2O from manure and fertilizer decomposition is also NOT recycling CO2.

These things have large neg net effects.

2644 2019-06-20 08:02:56 I much prefer to have 1 higher (guaranteed) hourly wage vs the old FT compensation package, where my $ was parceled out into 3 programs.  Sure the potential attached to our VCP and stocks was great, but there was no real guaranteed value.  Under the new wages, I'm making more $$.

2654 2019-06-20 07:56:11 BTCUSD is interesting one, will see if they push it to 10k over the weekend, but with this rally in stocks and Gold which will only get bigger, I would argue after a 300% rally and the current state of market taking profit and allocating into the better opportunities makes sense.
2655 2019-06-20 07:55:31 The American economy continues to soar to new heights as President #Trump continues pushing the bar like no other President has done before. #American Steel stocks rose to a record high just days after he took office. #America's winning like never before.

2752 2019-06-20 06:58:52 Hi Satish,

Most of the outperformance is due to the performance of 3-5 stocks in the indices.
2753 2019-06-20 06:58:13 I made more money through stocks and MFs when I was an 'inactive' investor compared to when I started watching my portfolio everyday. Took several years to learn patience and to not be greedy. Herd mentality, overconfidence, confirmation bias etc are all factors that contributed

2780 2019-06-20 06:38:19 Vs...consumers not spending, stagnation, companies debt stays high, govt prints money and buys their stocks and bonds to excite or incentivize the market. And this fake money is the fuel that is keeping things going. That’s NOT a healthy economic cycle. Example of now and then!
2781 2019-06-20 06:36:08 If you have so many different stocks that each purchase is so small that the % fee is substantial. And if you are not a buy-and-hold investor, too many stocks can be hard to manage. But I don’t think the diversification itself is the problem, but rather the total number of pieces
2782 2019-06-20 06:35:25 Of course the stock market is up. It takes way more inflated dollars to buy the stocks. Is he really that ignorant, I mean for someone who has dealt with Wall Street?
2783 2019-06-20 06:35:24 Think of it this way. Consumers are spending, companies make profit(cash), to buy back their stocks, that lowers their debt, increases their stock price. Which enables them to be more competitive hiring, wages, benefits. That’s a healthy cycle. Rn economy is roaring, this is good
2784 2019-06-20 06:33:59 Personally I think the stocks and pillory would be more fitting, but I agree that McConnell will be remembered as a villain of American history.

2812 2019-06-20 06:21:30 Thats different than government doing it. Companies use cash to buyback stocks to increase their value and stock price.

2842 2019-06-20 06:02:16 Stocks are up 26.43% during your tenure or, according to you, " up almost 50%."

2847 2019-06-20 05:58:49 @BTS_twt Do you have any new Cypher in stocks? I think we kinda need it. Or, tell Agust D we need his dose of shut the fuck up loser.
2848 2019-06-20 05:58:42 No I’ve never been a rancher in SA, and I get a bit pissed off with people attributing all livestock with the very dodgy and discredited cowspiracy genre.
2849 2019-06-20 05:57:06 Mine's similar. So I put more money in other stocks to balance up. They went down, Aaz carried on up! I suppose it's a nice problem to have, as long as it stays that way.
2850 2019-06-20 05:55:44 That is such bull wacky. Stocks are not up 50%.

Revive the mkt and go ahead with your divestment drive . PSU cos are worth much more than their stock price .. Divest at the right price.

2862 2019-06-20 05:48:52 Most of the Pain is out of the Market.
All poor quality stocks have become smallcap and penny stocks in this brutal correction which has become more worst than the one which happened in 2008.
But this has made the Market very healthy.
2863 2019-06-20 05:48:36 To be fair, the land-use effects are harder to measure/estimate than the direct emissions, and some other estimates put the number in the 10% range rather than 18%. But half of a lot is still a lot.
2864 2019-06-20 05:48:29 The net is 17.8% over all land use change effects in this dataset. Deforestation completely overwhelms everything else. Grassland sequesters far less carbon than rainforest does.
2865 2019-06-20 05:47:45 What about declining yields on long term US Bonds and rising value of Gold? Aren’t these indicators of true economic performance? When long term yields decline and gold rises these are alarm bells for pending crisis. Stocks have pumped off fake money and these KPIs show that.
2866 2019-06-20 05:46:19 You give everyone 1 million dollars each in reparations and I’m betting 90% of recipients have it all spent THE! Very next day!

2868 2019-06-20 05:42:49 sounds like what i think of when i think of stocks to be fair,
2869 2019-06-20 05:42:09 Its all only the same  talk.
The share price and the market says the exactly opposite:nokia isn't winning, its losing.
Nokia is one of the worst performing tech stocks in the whole world. Thats the reality.
2870 2019-06-20 05:42:02 When I hear so called analyst and fund managers that market is going to up or down or side or blah blah. I can really see that they don't know. Stay with quality stocks, funds & Gold for long term(upward of 7 years). It rewards you. #investing

2893 2019-06-20 05:25:14 Liar. Since election day, stocks up nearly 25%. Obama grew the market over 230%.
2894 2019-06-20 05:22:36 Facers Flint,
2895 2019-06-20 05:22:34 Many stocks are inflated - like your head.
2896 2019-06-20 05:21:40 It’s not particularly because it’s really for long term investing. Those who are willing to wait for value to grow in their equity (stocks). And a lot of stock movements are historical, as in, movements happen over time. You still need to eye it, but much less than the day to day
2897 2019-06-20 05:20:29 Stocks aren’t up 50% ! Obama brought the stock market to 20k. Doink!

2901 2019-06-20 05:15:25 Got my 1st taxpaying job in 9/75. Minimum wage was $2.10, equal to $10.32 today. This would add $6386 annually to a FT minimum wage earner's income, or $532/mo. Imagine the economic stimulus there. That's money they'd spend! Not invest in stocks.

2915 2019-06-20 05:04:36 The mkt rise during Obama was in spite of him,ie, he smothered economic growth by major tax/reg increases.

The Bernanke Fed QE/low interest rates pushed EVERYBODY into stocks. Ergo,an artificial bull mkt.

Pres Trump slashed taxes/regs/ended QE. Voila,real economic growth! Fact!
2916 2019-06-20 05:04:22 You do not know how to read stocks reports, eh.

Because if you did, you'd known that markets went up by much higher ratios and margins in the first 2 years of Obama's presidency.

2932 2019-06-20 04:55:52 Abolish LTCG. Fund flow should start from all over and outside India, then only one will invest in India. Govt  gained nothing.80℅ stocks bleeding since then.

2938 2019-06-20 04:50:10 I generally prefer average down.

2968 2019-06-20 04:31:36 Often get asked "how much more lower can it go?"A stock is not guided by our expectations.Which is why it is dangerous to invest in beaten down stocks based on this premise unless you have a special insight.Kwality,ADAG,PC Jewl,Manpasand,Vakrangee all bear testimony to this fact
2969 2019-06-20 04:31:20 #Tbonds have been good to me recently. Respected technical people see a near term peak. I’m tempted to step aside for a while. But I don’t really think Tbonds are a market like stocks. They can be affected by the need for safe assets. It’s tough to read.
2970 2019-06-20 04:30:46 Sir, you have saved many people from massive losses by giving perfectly timed advise. Despite that if people buy junk stocks then its their fate.
2971 2019-06-20 04:30:24 Under President Obama, stocks went up 182%. Btw, you shouldn't count from election day. After recession over, Obama averaged 2.42 to 2.48Million jobs per year. So, your riding what he started.

2975 2019-06-20 04:28:08 I don’t disagree with that. We grow 100 tons of grain for every ton of sheep meat, but without the healing power of grass on our soil, we’d grow a lot less, with a lot higher inputs of fuel, fert & chemicals, so the whole is much greater than the sum of the parts

2980 2019-06-20 04:26:08 2016 June , when gold was at this level, our PFs were triple of current value for the same stocks and quantities.

I am sure by Nov /Dec this year, the current PFs would have doubled if not tripled in value from here.

2995 2019-06-20 04:19:24 No, methane is NOT produced in the combustion of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels produce CO2 and H2O, not CH4.

Combustion of octane (e.g. gasoline):

C8H18 + 12.5 O2 => 8 CO2 + 9 H2O + heat

No methane (CH4) there. But lots of CO2.

3004 2019-06-20 04:17:14 We can't have as much beef as we do now from sustainable cattle farming alone. People need to eat less beef or else that 18% deforestation rate (and cattle's other, lesser GHG effects) will continue.

3012 2019-06-20 04:15:07 I know that, and I appreciate that. You're not the problem. Cattle can be raised sustainably. But most cattle is not raised sustainably, and that unsustainable cattle is why beef is cheap and common.

Deforestation is 18% of total GW. Cars are 10%, flying is 1.6%.

3029 2019-06-20 04:08:29 The US Fed is printing like mad and has done so for the last 10 years. Hardly responsible.

The rise in stocks, (previously Real Estate) IS the hidden inflation. Too much liquidity has to go somewhere, so the stocks are artificially kept on a bull market.

3031 2019-06-20 04:07:44 You claim to understand it, but you say things like "Cattle release methane from the ground through rumination", which is false, and indicates that you do not understand it.

The methane does not exist until it's synthesized during enteric fermentation.

They should try their luck in stocks which quote at 0.05 (lowest tradable price) and rise to 0.10 next day (100% rise) and continue the cycle. Eg Uttam value steel.

3072 2019-06-20 03:53:00 Seriously? You think you took office and immediately stocks rose and economy got better? Sounds like President Obama left you a flourishing economy.  How about an acknowledgement and thank you.

3076 2019-06-20 03:52:04 Half of Americans don’t even own any stocks... so, what does that mean for them?
3077 2019-06-20 03:52:02 The only thing increasing methane levels is that which is released through the production and usage of fossil fuels. Releasing the stored methane from a millennia ago.
3078 2019-06-20 03:51:48 Stocks up FIFTY PERCENT?!? 
 
Dude, WTF are you smoking?!?!?
3079 2019-06-20 03:51:33 #JainIrrigation once a darling of all brokerages who gave a buy rating of 140+ all disappeared!! #stocks
3080 2019-06-20 03:51:21 The 21st century will probably be the last century that we use fossil fuels for almost everything. Most of the costs of GW will be happening this century. Methane hits hardest during that time frame, much harder than CO2, and harder than its GWP100 metric suggests.
3081 2019-06-20 03:50:53 stocks > gold
3082 2019-06-20 03:50:53 Umm what stocks are up 50%?
3083 2019-06-20 03:50:30 No I’m not confusing the two. Livestock and methane cycle. Cattle don’t produce more methane. Cattle release methane from the ground through rumination, released into the atmosphere and it cycles back to earth.
3084 2019-06-20 03:50:23 Stocks fell to a all time low during your presidency thanks to your trade wars. The country hasn’t been this divided since the civil war because of your lies. You have the lowest approval of any president ever. The huge deficit this country is in is only overshadowed by your ego.
3085 2019-06-20 03:50:03 And before being oxidized into CO2, methane is around 120 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas.

Averaged over 100 years, methane is 28-36x more potent than CO2.

Averaged over 20 years, methane is 75-86x more potent than CO2.
3086 2019-06-20 03:49:56 What is the slippage that occurs when you trade stocks in such large quantities ? How do you deal with it?
3087 2019-06-20 03:46:48 You might as well write "Stocks up 67655b66%, gained 15 GRILLION DOLLARS, and more than SPACEMAN CRABAPPLESAUCE MONKEYS NEW JOBS!!!"

3092 2019-06-20 03:42:33 I love your dad. Trump 2020 BUT Don. You NEED to talk to your dad. He's starting to lose the gun community. Remember when you once said years ago "bump stocks shouldn't be banned"? You should've told your dad to NOT ban them. Its never been used in a crime before either!
3093 2019-06-20 03:42:26 If you’re not well-versed in what the Fed did from 1942-51 and how bonds and stocks responded, I would strongly recommend studying that period.
3094 2019-06-20 03:41:52 Gotta love how all the time sm doesn’t give exo jackshit to do so far this year but since kyungsoos enlisting they are finally letting them release music immediately after he leaves before their stocks plummet

3096 2019-06-20 03:40:31 @realDonaldTrump stocks  go up and down. There are important issues put the country to gether. One msgior flaw  us against you. That Nixon  did. This can cause msgior  blow back.

3103 2019-06-20 03:36:40 If they’ve loaded up their portfolio in particular stocks paying franked dividends, that’s a high risk strategy at a time when capital preservation should be high priority. Alternatively if they have a diversified portfolio and are getting $20-$30K in franking credits...

3106 2019-06-20 03:34:37 Kinda cool.  Get the pols to force everyone onto gas to be ,”green”, then have an energy monopoly!

Which stocks will be best to invest in, producers or pipeline operators?

Looking to the future.
3107 2019-06-20 03:34:34 ok then, ,no- i'd buy gold or mining stocks instead..if the trade deal is a bust (quite likely) post g20,spoos will get smoked in earnings season (which will suck) ,while gold/miners can keep going...that is my opinion,y gotta do what works for you.

RE: ERIBONG VERSION 3

ETA for the bongs will be updated after June 23 according to our supplier. SME will release some stocks on June 23 and we will know after June 23 if we got all the stocks. If not, it will be completed pa after EXplOration in Seoul—
3109 2019-06-20 03:33:59 Medium income is up because States voted to raise their minimum wage,  not the Federal Gov. Only reason stock market is up, because Corp. are buying back thier stocks w/tax breaks! How’s National Debt?
3110 2019-06-20 03:33:51 Still few experts are predicting more fall in small/mid cap.....i think after few months only 10 stocks will remain in market.
3111 2019-06-20 03:33:23 Sampai Bilaaa harus ku bertanya firasat hatimu yang terus membisuuuu. Sampai habis stocks

3113 2019-06-20 03:32:59 Methane oxidizes into H2O & co2 which we turn into carbohydrate. Nothing new here, been happening for millennia
3114 2019-06-20 03:32:25 penny stocks huh I’m the real wolf of Carson Street
3115 2019-06-20 03:32:13 The reason stocks seemed to go up under Obama is because of rampant quantitative easing, dollar collapse and the hope for Trump during the last 4 years of the Oh'Bama reign.

Look at what really happened to the $ after Trump announced his campaign for POTUS.
3116 2019-06-20 03:31:57 @realDonaldTrump stocks only go up until they drop floor then go back up then drop floor. It is all a game.
3117 2019-06-20 03:31:43 Stocks did well the first year because companies were able to bring foreign earnings back tax free. The market has now been stagnant or losing for over a year. Trump knows how to get quick bursts but ultimately is failing.
3118 2019-06-20 03:30:56 And stop lying to the public and saying the country is doing great just because some stocks are looking goodlol
3119 2019-06-20 03:30:27 Sa ngayon po icclose po namin yung 12 stocks ng cod hanggat maari Hindi po muna kami tatanggap ng inquires po sa COD . Sa Lunes po ulet magkakastock ng 20 pcs . Salamat po
3120 2019-06-20 03:30:17 If he bans suppressors arbitrarily like he did bump stocks, forget it. Don’t alienate your supporters.
3121 2019-06-20 03:29:35 Look at the stocks bwtn you & Barack. YOU LOSE!
3122 2019-06-20 03:29:27 Just as long as we can avoid any discussion of trade for a month or so. I have some stocks that become long-term in mid-July and with interest rates inverted and tanking, well, you know.
3123 2019-06-20 03:27:03 Stocks are almost the same as a year ago (with some wild fluctuations in between).
3124 2019-06-20 03:26:10 Expect market to open on a flat note on account of global cues. U S. stocks rallied for a third day (Dow Jones gained 0.2%) after the US Federal Reserve struck a dovish tone in its latest policy statement, kept unchanged interest rate (2.25% -2.5%). #MOMarketUpdates
3125 2019-06-20 03:25:54 Markets gist for the day: Markets will be on rollercoaster today if you don't hit a perfect entry your doomed specially in options either buy or sell be stock specific and don't select stocks like yesbank or ibullhsgfin for the day bigger sl required for entries after gaps.
3126 2019-06-20 03:25:36 My question was what YOU meant. Your reading of his article led you to say that GHGs are not proportional to GW effects. That is a weird statement to make.

Keep in mind that animal husbandry causes 3x as much CO2 increase as methane increase due to land use changes.
3127 2019-06-20 03:23:48 26,000+. stocks drop or correction coming.
3128 2019-06-20 03:22:48 Those who went out weeping, wearing their 'stocks
Will return with joy, flexing in their crocs.
3129 2019-06-20 03:22:39 CNBC isn't totally reliable. Everyday give 20 stocks and if 1 or 2 go right they start dancing.
3130 2019-06-20 03:22:29 Higher cost stocks still carry more R:R for long calls. If there are $$$ gold stocks on the TSX, I would check risk graphs and compare on TOS platform. Really great options calculators.
3131 2019-06-20 03:22:18 That is not at all how the methane cycle works. You're describing carbon,, not methane.

Methane is *generated* in the soil by bacteria. It leaks out on its own; it is not transported by plants at all.

Methane is also generated from cellulose by bacteria in livestock.
3132 2019-06-20 03:21:42 almost 80% if not more of pot stocks got totally wrecked recently, more like crypto alt coins bubble, damn
3133 2019-06-20 03:21:31 Fed has lost control. 2-year and 10-year yields below #Fed funds rate. How long will it be before the Fed goes full #BOJ & slashes rates into negative territory and starts buying stocks?
3134 2019-06-20 03:20:32 Markets feeling odd

I'm old enough to remember 'buy on mystery, sell on history'

Here we be, stocks running, usd down, gold up, bonds running...

On Fed saying precisely what everyone expected.
3135 2019-06-20 03:20:19 You think we hang in another week? One week of theta burn on those is not insignificant. People are going ga-ga and chasing gold and bonds. Historically, that's not bullish for stocks, whether late 2007 or even mid-2016 (int'm term). It's bearish for the economy and risk.
3136 2019-06-20 03:19:25 #US stocks closed higher on Wednesday after the #FederalReserve kept interest rates unchanged, as widely expected, but signalled potential cuts later this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.15%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.30%. The Nasdaq 100 added 0.42%.
3137 2019-06-20 03:19:04 @narendramodi Sir, kindly look into stock market operations people are losing big money in small cap stocks  and IBC companies and nothing done from regulators to stop this ...so please look into and save small investors hard earned money
3138 2019-06-20 03:18:54 Many gold and silver exploration stocks are down 90-95% since the 2016 highs, when gold was lower than it is right now.
3139 2019-06-20 03:18:33 The only reason the stock market is booming is because the companies are buying back there stocks. Quit lying to the American people!!!
3140 2019-06-20 03:18:16 No one is saying to put your entire net worth in Bitcoin. But, rather, to begin to view it as part of a diversified portfolio. You have your home, your stocks, your cash, etc & then you have some $BTC as part of a long term strategy. Like it or not, we are heading that way.
3141 2019-06-20 03:17:59 I can send you $10 to buy another thousand penny stocks if it'll help your book.

3144 2019-06-20 03:16:38 This world is full demons, stocks and bonds and bible traders so I do the deed, get up and leave
3145 2019-06-20 03:16:17 Methane cycle? Recycle? You're confusing methane and CO2 again. No living organisms take methane out of the atmosphere; it is degraded when it encoutners hydroxyl radicals in the upper atmosphere.
3146 2019-06-20 03:16:01 If you buy and sell stocks of a weed company does that make you a drug dealer?
3147 2019-06-20 03:15:54 Now that the Fed print is coming even without a stock market crash individual stocks are probably going to go ballistic. Doesn't matter what scam company stock you buy with Helicopter Jerry shitting fiat out his ass, even snapchat is up 300% this year lol.

3150 2019-06-20 03:15:07 I'm going to try and invest most of my money I've recently earned in stocks, so I'm debating what to spend the rest on lol I already ordered a Bakugou body pillow so I'm thinking of getting some new clothes or makeup  maybe serum for my hair??  idkk as much as I want food+
3151 2019-06-20 03:15:03 Don’t think that stocks! I love your videos and streams
3152 2019-06-20 03:14:26 Your gorl made $100 in stocks yeet
3153 2019-06-20 03:13:34 apple stocks rise by 20%.
3154 2019-06-20 03:13:23 Blah blah I'm fucking great. I'm a genius. Stocks are up and that helps the wealthy not the average person. The deficit is exploding too, good fucking job.
3155 2019-06-20 03:12:43 Land use changes (e.g. deforestation) exceed the GWP of cow CH4 by a factor of 3. (18% vs 5% of total GHG). 80% of deforestation is driven by cattle.

N2O from fertilizer use when producing animal feed is about equal to cow CH4.

Methane is only about 23% of cows' GHG footprint.
3156 2019-06-20 03:12:37 It’s not just about the stocks. Be presidential for once.
3157 2019-06-20 03:11:24 Since Election Day 2016, Stocks up almost 50%, Stocks gained 9.2 Trillion Dollars in value, and more than 5,000,000 new jobs added to the Economy. @LouDobbs If our opponent had won, there would have been a market crash, plain and simple! @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity @IngrahamAngle

3159 2019-06-20 03:11:02 Index is well managed with few stocks. But question is how long can they manage index. Tough time ahead..
3160 2019-06-20 03:10:02 “The inversion of the yield curve, especially on the short end, may reflect this political reality more than it does growth fears. If this is the case, the recent yield curve inversion is ironically good news for stocks in the near term.”
3161 2019-06-20 03:09:45 It appears there is a committed lobby which has started operating in Stock Market since Sep'18. It ensures that if any stock starts going up in d morning it sees that it comes down by close of day @stocks_in @stockbaat @stockx What is yr call?
3162 2019-06-20 03:09:40 Stocks are up 25%. Jesus H Christ republicans suck at math.

3164 2019-06-20 03:08:35 Indian Investor's undergoing very tuff situations in market. Almost the worst fall in stocks when index pretends as if everything is alright.. never seen such type.
3165 2019-06-20 03:07:24 combos are impossibly hard to find here.  Except one convenience store that stocks Pizza and Nacho cheese combos.

Every time I go there, I get some to remind myself why I don't eat them.
3166 2019-06-20 03:06:53 Stocks are up 30%, not "nearly 50%", since you entered office and they've been stagnant since the beginning of *2018* because of the uncertainty and the irrationality of your international trade war.  

That's 18 months of no growth in the market, thanks to you.
3167 2019-06-20 03:06:39 I recommend reading the article by Dr Cain that I sent. It will answer your (very important) question around GHG and warming and how different the gases are.
3168 2019-06-20 03:06:30 Stocks rally $2 or $3. Bitcoin can rally $2k to 3k in 1 day. Just facts
3169 2019-06-20 03:05:54 I went to a furniture store today and freaked out over the style and convenience of different coffee tables.. time to buy stocks and kiss my childhood goodbye
3170 2019-06-20 03:05:20 stocks are nothing but fake money.

3175 2019-06-20 03:01:58 Methane is stored in soil, plants then allow for it to be transported through tissue and leaves to be released into atmosphere.
Plants become a storage system for methane & released at digestion by microbial activity in the rumen of livestock, hence a cycle of storage & release
3176 2019-06-20 03:01:31 Stocks move up on optimism. How much they have gone up since Trump won the election on November 2016?
3177 2019-06-20 03:01:14 And with all your #MSM talking points #Trump still manage to: Have stocks rise after dealing with China. The economy is booming. Small businesses are thriving, jobs are coming back. And puts our border security first.

MINDTREE; INFY; ICICIPRULI; TVSMOTOR; HDFCBANK.
3183 2019-06-20 02:59:50 False dichotomy.

Agriculture is a part. Transportation is a part. Electricity is a part. Industry is a part. Those four sectors each comprise about 1/4 of total GW effects. We shouldn't neglect any.
3184 2019-06-20 02:58:46 Now just double them up with mirror images, line them up in stocks, and there you go!
3185 2019-06-20 02:58:30 Does anyone know how to invest in penny stocks??
3186 2019-06-20 02:57:08 I don't know what you're aiming for with your attempt at distinguishing between GHG and GW. Is your point just that 100 years isn't the best time span for evaluating GWP? Which time span do you prefer, shorter or longer?

N2O lasts 114 years, btw.
3187 2019-06-20 02:56:30 Thanks obama. Nice for the rich, not for middle class who dont own stocks.
3188 2019-06-20 02:55:50 Which index.or stocks....?
3189 2019-06-20 02:55:20 Hope u enjoyed PANIC in #BATTERY STOCKS Yesterday ???
3190 2019-06-20 02:55:16 Who in the right mind would wait 3 months for their order (which is ready stocks btw, not pre order) and only contact the merchant when they did not receive their order after 3 months? Lmfao auntie you're a joke
3191 2019-06-20 02:55:14 That’s why I said large grazing herds of ruminants....not herbivores..... livestock don’t add to the methane cycle, they only recycle it.
3192 2019-06-20 02:54:06 I don't really like SINA or WB here, since there are much better Chinese tech stocks to buy -- like Tencent, Alibaba, Huya.... (which don't depend as much on ads) but both stocks really shouldn't go much lower from here (because of their valuations).
3193 2019-06-20 02:53:49 Fiis trade in index stocks and in economic downtrend anyhow big companies growing So nifty holding ground. Rest falling due to falling sales citing weak economic enviornment

3197 2019-06-20 02:50:02 Most millennials do not have stock investments. It’s a wealthy person thing. My stocks are up because I invest in foreign markets that are more stable. Jobs have seen a slow down. Translation: you suck. Please resign.
3198 2019-06-20 02:49:31 Not all herbivores are ruminants. Hindgut fermenters (like horses) eat a lot more but digest it less, leaving more of the total decomposition in the manure stage, which has better oxygenation and lower methane production.

3228 2019-06-20 02:37:09 You actually believe that?  Should they just print money and do QE forever? Keep buying stocks and bonds until they own the S&P?
3229 2019-06-20 02:37:02 This is false. Methane is produced by the bacteria in ruminant stomachs fermenting cellulose in an anoxic environment. Decomposition of organic matter in ventilated (oxygenated) environments e.g. by fungi does not produce methane.

3246 2019-06-20 02:31:45 Stocks in the US markets rose higher as the Fed kept the rates unchanged and said it would 'act as appropriate' in order to sustain the economy

3263 2019-06-20 02:25:30 @BullandBaird confirm I have this figured out. Stocks falling in May because treasuries falling. Now stocks rallying but treasury yields below levels investors were “concerned” about? In 2018 stocks dropping because rates rising too fast?
3264 2019-06-20 02:25:09 Have you checked oil stocks recently.
3265 2019-06-20 02:24:54 Aren't you only supposed to fight battles that you've already won?

-U.S. stocks rallied for a third day and yields on shorter-maturity Treasuries tumbled after the Federal Reserve struck a dovish tone in its latest policy statement.
-Bond traders are virtually certain that the Fed will ease policy as soon as next month.
3287 2019-06-20 02:17:18 Stocks don't help average Americans because they need money for practical things like food, rent, clothing and don't have disposable income to invest. 
Raise wages and then stocks up could actually benefit more people.

3331 2019-06-20 02:00:46 They do love their penny stocks...
3332 2019-06-20 02:00:41 It's even more relevant now I think. "... Then as now, many were amused by the demagogue and moved by his vile vision. Some have perfectly reasonable explanations for their decisions, while others have little to go on but incoherent rage."
3333 2019-06-20 02:00:21 AHAHA nagdala ng stocks here.

When I talked to her she said lang give them time to look! She knows I'm passing na tho.
3334 2019-06-20 02:00:03 Both investigated. Both found to have been financially corrupt. Chao sold her stocks THE DAY AFTER REPORT RELEASED.  Trump has chosen to do nothing. Same with other Cabinet members found to have misappropriated tax payer dollars. What does it take to get a little WH integrity?
3335 2019-06-20 01:59:37 Going to line store now! Any requests? Hope they have full stocks 
3336 2019-06-20 01:59:34 Pakai la beras jasmine, pakai ginger, pakai chicken stocks

3338 2019-06-20 01:58:27 IRA , Crypto , index funds , stocks , gambling for fun , I need more flow
3339 2019-06-20 01:58:27 the big question is where?  everything looks like is trying to go to zero with the exception of ten fifteen stocks,  whose turn is due next!
3340 2019-06-20 01:58:26 90% of stocks are owned by the wealthy and more than half of the population doesn’t even own stocks. Most people don’t give a sh$t on your #1 focus as president
3341 2019-06-20 01:57:22 You can invert and ask how you’d destroy wealth and avoid that. Obv bonds at negative rates destroy wealth and I’d say the same about ultra low rate U.S. bonds. Crypto? speculative. Gold? Probably will preserve wealth but not provide real returns. Stocks? Possible real returns.
3342 2019-06-20 01:57:09 What a joke. Minimum wage isn't a livable wage, Add'l taxes per paycheck buy a pack of gum. But ur stocks are up. Ur kids can eat. Ur kids have a comfortable bed. Ur kids can wear Yeezys. Bet you get a few nice sushi meals in a month. Lucky you. That's all that matters.
3343 2019-06-20 01:57:01 If stocks were up 50% since Election Day 2016, the DOW would be at about 32,000.  The DOW ended today at 26,504.

STOP LYING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!
3344 2019-06-20 01:56:02 #MushroomHead #POTUS - How STUPID are you guys. The Stocks were TRENDING high before you showed up. You are indeed the #IdiotInChief ! #Biden #Trump #ABCNews #CBSNews #NBCNews #MSNBC #CNN #FoxNews #Resistance #ResignTrump #DumpTrump #25thAmendmentNow #MAGA #ThrowThemOut
3345 2019-06-20 01:55:23 It has been proven! Hands down. Chao and Ross signed affidavits promising to divest from stocks in which their govt positions had influence. Neither did so. Both profited greatly from decisions they made on govt spending and the effect of that spending on their stocks and income.
3346 2019-06-20 01:55:10 Oh right, and stocks just happened to ski rocket exactly when Trump, a billionaire business man took over the White house.
3347 2019-06-20 01:55:03 Bitcoin stocks are lagging behind Bitcoin in 2019 https://bncweb/insights/bitcoin-stocks-are-lagging-behind-bitcoin-in-2019
3348 2019-06-20 01:55:01 Thai stocks, as a whole, are arguably quite cheap. Yes, current economic, political & demographic data points aren’t terribly rosy at the moment - but the heavily retail investor dominated market seems to be a bit too negative. Patience is a virtue here. #thaistocks #SET
3349 2019-06-20 01:53:57 Actually all gold stocks will not do well except for their inventory gains. It is better to buy gold, then stocks. Chalte Chalte
3350 2019-06-20 01:53:49 Nope!
As promised he’s making wealthy Americans more wealthy!
Most of middle class has no money in stocks!
He’s only helping the top 2% of America!
#idiotsfortrump
3351 2019-06-20 01:53:25 Stocks will likely be lower on Election Day in 2020 than 2016....and maybe 2012.
3352 2019-06-20 01:53:24 Trump has no idea that only 1/2 of adult Americans are in the market -- and that 80% of stocks are owned by the top 10% richest people
3353 2019-06-20 01:53:23 Bullshit.  My stocks are NOT up 50%.  I didn’t even break even last year.  All gains were wiped out at the end of the year. Maybe Elaine Chao is up 50%, but not real people.
3354 2019-06-20 01:51:11 Stocks stagnant for the last year,  unemployment great, but also stagnant. Meanwhile, most saw nothing from the great tax scam, prices are higher thanks to tariffs, and you've had to bail out farmers TWICE. Easy to say what might have happened, absolutely no evidence to prove it.
3355 2019-06-20 01:51:07 9-5 dad who just invested in stocks and is about to pick up his kids from private tennis lesson at the country club
3356 2019-06-20 01:50:53 Stocks rose at first then plummeted then rose again it would of did the same if Santa Claus was president. Jobs have Obama to thank. Just crash litterly and figuratively.
3357 2019-06-20 01:50:47 Stocks kept rallying to new highs for 2 months in 2007 after first cut.. kept rallying for 2yrs after 1998 cuts
3358 2019-06-20 01:50:16 Energy market is different and more competitive. Start up cost is A$10million for a retailer so these ventures are costly. Saying this as a shareholder in ANZ, Westpac the good blue chip stocks #sorry
3359 2019-06-20 01:50:11 Yes, stocks up almost 50% since Election Day 2016, only that the DOW is floundering and defending its level of 25,000 since January 2018 !!

3363 2019-06-20 01:48:48 My stocks are up. Wages are up. And taxes in paycheck are down.
3364 2019-06-20 01:48:39 Wanting to invest in stocks but having -34$ in my bank account, devastation and betrayal
3365 2019-06-20 01:47:58 I was already employed. I don’t own stocks yet. My wages are the same. And he got rid of tax cuts for home owners and student loans so I paid more in taxes. How did he help me again?
3366 2019-06-20 01:47:56 Try to remember, the stocks, bonds, gold and toilet paper are not going higher. The $ is collapsing.
3367 2019-06-20 01:47:26 Stocks up about 400% since Obama took over presidency, with a steady rise after the Bush-Cheney GOP market crash due to similar policies as now— massive tax cuts for corporations & wealthy, massive overspending and unbudgeted wars, and Trump just hopped on the 2009 rising tide!
3368 2019-06-20 01:47:07 I agree. It’s not about politics. Economy and stocks were going well when trump arrived. His behaviour is not presidential or even mature. He lies daily. He bullys and insults people. He is a disgrace as a human. How you can not see this is crazy.
3369 2019-06-20 01:47:06 Fed meeting results: 1 for raising rates, 8 for rates unchanged for the year, 8 for two .25 point drops. With Sec. 232 decision due in July and expectations for rate decrease, correlation between broader markets and #U stocks could be VERY apparent! or
3370 2019-06-20 01:46:38 Stocks grew faster the last 28 months of Obama than the first 28 months of your occupation. So there's that. Lou Dobbs is a hack.
3371 2019-06-20 01:46:13 Majority of Americans don’t have stocks.
3372 2019-06-20 01:46:08 Make me president of FIFA and I'll immediately get rid of VAR and put whoever was responsible for its adoption into public stocks
3373 2019-06-20 01:45:57 I don't trade the market. I trade stocks. quite frankly i don't care if the mkt doesn't go up as long as we don't get a sell everything event, i'll do fine.
3374 2019-06-20 01:45:46 Buying and selling stocks
3375 2019-06-20 01:45:31 Crazy, haha all I wanted was to trade it 
3376 2019-06-20 01:45:29 Love you, but never play the Market, stocks usually go down before elections along w October surprise,
3377 2019-06-20 01:45:03 One last question, is there a place where you can find out how much supply is available for stocks?
3378 2019-06-20 01:44:31 Most Americans don’t own stocks. The tax cut benefits the rich. Wages are stagnant. The economy you brag about benefits you and your corrupt cronies. #ImpeachTrumpNow

3382 2019-06-20 01:44:07 Chris, I agree with you but the fed can take rates negative and if things go bad they'll probably buy stocks so I'm having trouble seeing the bear case. Help me out.

3387 2019-06-20 01:40:56 I'm not a CFA or CNBC big shot. I think I know enough to say that one bad tweet from Trump on tariffs or any failure at G20, there will be trouble. Gold up, stocks up, bonds down, inverted yield curve, very low unemployment, trade war. Not a good mix!
3388 2019-06-20 01:40:54 Stocks don’t impact the majority of people, especially your base.  Job growth has slowed down since you took office ... our debt has exploded and the recession is coming.  You suck at this leader thing.
3389 2019-06-20 01:40:51 Think the fact that $GC appears to have awoken from a 6 year slumber and stocks are near all time high says something about how irrational this market has become.

3392 2019-06-20 01:39:22 "...the stock market has done a good job pricing..." Really, Jonas? Can you name any other stocks carrying a 43% shorts position that's holding up as well? You should have waited a while before joining them with your $10.00 share price. $230 now? Nor good enough!
3393 2019-06-20 01:39:06 True sir ,as you rightly and repeatedly said - "Many a stocks would be available in mouth watering rates " ...it is the case now ,and anyone can easily get trapped into it .... would you mind to suggest any bearish call apart from DHFL,Jain,Yes etc
3394 2019-06-20 01:39:06 When does the trickle down start.  If the stocks are up 50% the salaries are up???
3395 2019-06-20 01:38:16 Sooooo, when do I get my stock? Did I miss the stock handout?! I mean it's great that stocks are doing so well, I just hate that most citizens missed everyone gets stock day at the market 
3396 2019-06-20 01:37:36 It's a great crew there. I've thought about finding something closer (not-quite-so-LCS), but nobody else in my neck of the woods is as nice, with as good a new selection. Their back issues, trades, etc., stocks are really good, too. Women-friendly and kid-friendly.

3400 2019-06-20 01:35:58 I don't have stocks. My wages didn't change. Jobs are flat. Manufacturing didn't come back.... Not even Trump manufacturing... The deficit is skyrocketing at the fastest pace in history!
3401 2019-06-20 01:35:27 I have no funds invested in URA. My funds are invested in Uranium stocks that have already made moves off of their lows, indicating they have begun their bullish cycles already.
3402 2019-06-20 01:35:26 who knows some bout buying stocks? if u do pls dm me
3403 2019-06-20 01:35:14 Since election day? You con man. 2018 was the worst year for stocks since the Great Recession. Stocks were up 232% under Obama. Now you want to take credit for his work. He left office with 75 consecutive months of job growth. Handed you the strongest economy in the world.
3404 2019-06-20 01:35:00 I hadn't before now. If this indeed JFK jr, I might need to invest in underpants stocks, as many will be shat.
3405 2019-06-20 01:34:58 Fa sho about to start investing in stocks and crypto
3406 2019-06-20 01:33:19 Nobody gives a shit about stocks....its all about how this administration has impacted the middle / lower class quality of living. ( not saying that impact is good.....just a reference to how voters might think )
3407 2019-06-20 01:33:18 buy stocks, gold, bonds, bitcoin.  Doesn’t matter when the Fed’s doing this, it all pays.
3408 2019-06-20 01:32:54 So while some of it is luck. Holding that stock through highs and lows was all you and not many people can do that. That is the alpha that investing in stocks adds to the equation and it's a big differentiator in many cases.
3409 2019-06-20 01:32:18 50% my ass.  What stocks are up 50%  GTFOH with that.  Ticker symbols or it didn’t happen.
3410 2019-06-20 01:32:00 Donnie, great job. However, Market was up more under Obama, stocks gained more $ under Obama, and more jobs were added under Obama. But keep trying.
3411 2019-06-20 01:31:57 You have no basis for that claim. Also, stocks do not mean prosperity for everyone. Additionally, please stop saying all your opponents hate America and want to destroy it. Try “we both want the best for America but just disagree on how to go about it.”
3412 2019-06-20 01:31:06 I judge trump on everything BUT the stock market. I care about our citizens, veterans, environment, educational system, LGBTQ, all people of color, a woman’s right to choose, and an honest Democratic election. He gets an F across the board. But hey, your stocks are up.
3413 2019-06-20 01:30:52 From what I read and hear in the news, there have been large profit repatriations, but as expected, companies are returning money to shareholders rather than investing it. The wealthy owning stocks, is why you need a capital gains tax.
3414 2019-06-20 01:30:15 Stocks have been climbing at a great rate since 2009, Obama created 16 million jobs.  President Clinton added 18.6 million jobs, he presided over eight years of steady economic growth without adding to the debt.

So your tweet is nothing but BS from your jerks at FOX!

3423 2019-06-20 01:26:51 U.S. stocks gained 21% for the first two years of the Trump administration. That translates to a 10% annual return. By comparison, U.S. stocks gained 71.2% in the first two years of the Obama administration, and the 30.8% annualized return

3429 2019-06-20 01:23:55 In the same period for Obama from election day 2008 to mid-June 2011, stocks were up over 50%. In the first 24 months following the last of job loss from the recession, 4.3 million+ jobs were added. Oh, and O's last 24 months had 33k more new jobs than your first 24.

3434 2019-06-20 01:22:26 @OphirGottlieb In fairness the drop in December kept us so busy buying puts and Volatility that we almost forgot to buy a few stocks.
3435 2019-06-20 01:21:57 Stocks lost a hell of a lot under your watch too. Let’s not forget that.
3436 2019-06-20 01:21:56 Need to invest in some more stocks
3437 2019-06-20 01:21:32 Yes, what is it in the ... days of yore? And you put ‘Em in the ... you know... 

You mean in the stocks, or a pillary

Yes, exactly. 



ITS A FRIGGING HAMMER
3438 2019-06-20 01:21:27 Stocks don't help the average American as the majority of us can't afford to buy stocks. The jobs numbers were better under Obama and paid more. If Hillary would have won, we would have stated in the Paris Climate Agreement, stayed in the Iran Agreement and gas would be under $2.
3439 2019-06-20 01:21:08 @ASOS_Servicecli vous remettez les stocks quand.
3440 2019-06-20 01:20:45 He was not all bearish in 2007-8. He thought FNMA was a life-time buying opportunity and AIG had a bullet-proof book. He hated the Energy stocks and, particularly, fertilizers, mainly because he thought China was a scam and driving commodity demand.
3441 2019-06-20 01:20:38 US stocks post worst year in a decade as the S&P 500 falls more than 6% in 2018 and wall street says you are grossly overstating everything and that 2019 numbers will be bleek unless you stop lying and playing games.
3442 2019-06-20 01:20:04 Stocks flat for last 18 months since the Trump Tax Scam
3443 2019-06-20 01:18:55 More (as trump says)”Bullshit” stocks up 33% and it was all in 2017 keep ridding Obama’s coattails you clown
3444 2019-06-20 01:18:17 Ohh shit you kinda know what you’re doing. And yea I know I do the same with stocks lol
3445 2019-06-20 01:18:04 Stocks did NOT create jobs. Jobs are low wage jobs with NO benefit. The CEO is making millions, stock's are making millions and workers are getting fucked
3446 2019-06-20 01:17:28 Bonds under 2%, gold up 40

3447 2019-06-20 01:16:51 No, doofus. Stocks were on the rise for years, thanks to
3448 2019-06-20 01:16:46 I own plenty of stocks that have beaten the Dow and S&P over the past 5 years.  But none that have beaten  Bitcoin.  I will give you that.  But in a few more years everything I own will have beaten Bitcoin.
3449 2019-06-20 01:16:46 That doesn't really matter to me because unlike your rich friends I don't own a lot of stocks.
3450 2019-06-20 01:16:44 Since Inauguration Day 2017, Stocks up 33%. 
Obama did much better, Dow doubled in his first 2 1/2 years.
If Hillary had won she would have done much better too.
3451 2019-06-20 01:15:47 No they would’ve. @elonmusk was loved and then one day tslaq and a fury of trolls came out and was death to Tesla. It’s out paced all other automotive stocks by leaps and bounds
3452 2019-06-20 01:15:19 Excuse me , have you compared employment, GDP , housing, stocks, from Obama’s administration to this one ? You seem to be a little ignorant.
3453 2019-06-20 01:15:18 Don’t forget stocks, FLYING
3454 2019-06-20 01:14:45 No, they always peak before, about 6mos on avg (Last: S&P peaked Oct 07, rec started Dec 07.

Other side, stocks bottom about 3mos before the recession ends (Last: Bottomed Mar 09, Rec ended Jun 09).  One exception in 120 yrs, Rec ended Nov 01, stocks bottomed Oct 02. Why?
3455 2019-06-20 01:14:40 How the fuck is the 10 yr under 2% and gold ripping but stocks at ath????
3456 2019-06-20 01:14:27 Stocks up 300% and 11,000,000 jobs created by Obama.

Plus he had a way bigger  hammer than you do.

3458 2019-06-20 01:13:49 First the fed pushed the bubble into tech stocks, then into the US property market, now into corporate and sovereign debt. Then their friends in Europe, Japan and China helped and now this next crisis will be a currency crisis. Find a hedge. Gold isn’t a bad one
3459 2019-06-20 01:13:45 Maybe nobody told you that the new job creation figures are down and previous mouths have been revised down. Jobs equal Economy, Stocks equal the Rich get Richer.

3461 2019-06-20 01:13:03 That’s bullshit Joe and you KNOW it! The economy was stagnant at best when @realDonaldTrump was elected.  The economy has grown steadily since Trump was sworn in.  Stocks up, unemployment at record low levels for blacks and Hispanics!  Obama didn’t do this...@POTUS did!
3462 2019-06-20 01:12:14 I think I should buy stocks in Starbucks the ludicrously High prices they charge for coffees.
3463 2019-06-20 01:12:01 And for the majority of us that don't own stocks? (ya know, the ones paying taxes)...(some of us buy food and clothing and pay other bills and don't have money to play the market)
3464 2019-06-20 01:11:32 A lot of people have missed this whole move — clinging to an FCI framework, unable to comprehend how the Fed could cut at 2900, unable to listen to “insurance” narrative or look at what stocks did in 1995. Meanwhile it’s also Greenspan 1998 “oasis”.  If you do the work, well...

3475 2019-06-20 01:09:20 the OTC needs to get out of the fairytale world that stocks only go up that there is only good news. Pumpers want to make you blind sheep pump everything as good so they can dump on you specially when they know its bad. NEWS FLASH there is bad news that comes on stocks as well.
3476 2019-06-20 01:09:06 Corollary: have stocks ever been at an all-time high DURING a recession? Not quizzing, because I don't know. I am wondering if you or any reader knows.
3477 2019-06-20 01:08:56 Mr. President the libtards being rich are all enjoying the benefits of your great leadership with their stocks and money, yet don't appreciate you at all. This is the same as they enjoy the sun that our heavenly father rises over both the good and evil despite of the fact......
3478 2019-06-20 01:08:46 So the PTJ was correct in real time and before the fact - buy gold, buy stocks.
3479 2019-06-20 01:08:15 How much did your family make from stocks???????
3480 2019-06-20 01:08:11 my favorite bm play is when a dude is bad and campy, I'll try and take 2 stocks as fast as I can then run away and do minimal damage to time them out. it's super disappointing if I accidentally kill them
3481 2019-06-20 01:07:52 stocks  go  up and  down with your mentality, if anyone causes a crash it will be you.  lots of little  towns are doing  poorly economically. we hv to work 3 jobs to make it at 9/hr which is not a life. U braggart.  step down.
3482 2019-06-20 01:07:26 remember how petty i was when someone copied me so when they opened a g.o for certain goods and my friend found their supplier, i bought all their supplier’s stocks 
3483 2019-06-20 01:06:48 The growth of stock market doesn’t equal to real growth. The stocks has been up since Trump, tax cut is a huge factor, cutting tax is good, but also not adjust huge Corp debt problem, stocks can go up on buy back. It is good for equity holder, but not low wage fix income earner.

3486 2019-06-20 01:04:42 No. It’s only because I think shotguns should have stocks. I’m not a fan of this trend. The paint is ok.
3487 2019-06-20 01:03:52 While that is true. I'm looking at it in a macro sense. Yes hard working Americans own stocks. But most stocks are owned by the already well off. To tout it as the only measure of how Americans are doing is disingenuous and all he seems to do.

3495 2019-06-20 01:01:24 Thanks Obama. But the stock market, by which 80% of stocks are owned by less than 20% of the population, isn’t really the measure of a healthy economy. Look at the debt and deficit your running up like mad.

3496 2019-06-20 01:01:11 Canada found inflation today #CPI ...this will filter to the US ..even with their most skewed idea of what inflation is.. so I guess my question is: with stocks near ATHs, unemployment al ATLs, and inflation over 2% right around the corner...why cut rates?
3497 2019-06-20 01:01:01 Because all Americans have stocks. Right.
3498 2019-06-20 01:00:29 I'm in the industry also. I'm too rookie to know how to mislead anyone yet in stocks. I work with UFC fighters and their doctors. A few are in on NSPX that's all. Everyone is holding. Good things take time. GL JAH

3500 2019-06-20 00:59:43 Very true. Not just index stocks, but many midcaps too orders triggered by s/w, algo. If you are an individual investor or trader without any of those systems and tools, you are to be pitied.
3501 2019-06-20 00:59:43 In fact,  your tariffs have flattened the market. You have done nothing to boost the stock market. You manipulate it with your hyperbolic bs. #stocks #TrumpResign #tariffs
3502 2019-06-20 00:59:40 Just keep calling them out. These platforms are committing slow suicide. Ultimately their businesses and stocks will suffer and something new will come along. Even liberals will stop using these things when everyone is of the same mindset... It's called boredom.

3515 2019-06-20 00:54:00 Stocks up, bonds up, gold up in A/H... someone isn’t right
3516 2019-06-20 00:53:50 Wages are up, stocks are up, 401’s are up, GDP is up, entrepreneurship is up, people are getting more money back in their paychecks. Everyone is doing better and unemployment is down. There are more jobs than people to fill them. Things are great right now. For everyone.

3523 2019-06-20 00:52:35 Why is it that Elon Musk gets fined for statements that affected Tesla stock, but Trump faces no consequences when his statements affect companies'stocks?
3524 2019-06-20 00:52:17 Nobody is debating whether or not these are good and helpful things. Part of the reason why SOME people are happy about the economy is the possibility of being able to CHOOSE AND AFFORD stocks, where they couldn't under O's.

3527 2019-06-20 00:50:34 The expensive stocks will drop the hardest in a big pull back or a recession. At least that’s my understanding. But, if you aren’t worried about that . I just have zero faith that Trump will do anything positive for the economy. And rate cuts are already priced in.
3528 2019-06-20 00:50:25 And how many record drops has the stock market taken since you took office?  And the average American can't afford to buy stocks, so that isn't doing a damn thing for the poor people.  May be more jobs, but not more money
3529 2019-06-20 00:49:22 The vast majority of Americans don’t own any stocks and won’t ever own any.

3543 2019-06-20 00:44:44 It’s the same thing as you do and I wanting the same thing and not knowing if you’ll pay more than I’m willing to pay so you just pay an inflated price to secure the asset. It’s not recommended when trading stocks, so why is it the logic in sports.

3545 2019-06-20 00:44:05 I mean, stocks could lose some value.  Then we'd need to cut to zero immediately.  Like true capitalists.
3546 2019-06-20 00:43:34 38% on the stocks and job additions are the same monthly additions as under Obama.  Still good, but be honest with the numbers.

3575 2019-06-20 00:34:45 Stocks are right where they were in 2018 and were making a faster climb under Obama
3576 2019-06-20 00:34:40 Laughing stocks with teams like Ottawa and Edmonton. Okay bud.
3577 2019-06-20 00:34:32 #RT @realDonaldTrump: Since Election Day 2016, Stocks up almost 50%, Stocks gained 9.2 Trillion Dollars in value, and more than 5,000,000 new jobs added to the Economy. @LouDobbs If our opponent had won, there would have been a market crash, plain and simple! @TuckerCarlson …
3578 2019-06-20 00:33:38 Most cattle are grazed for the majority of their lives and eat a mixture of grains and grasses and/or agricultural waste byproducts during the final months of their lives, to fatten the for market. They don’t typically eat grain their whole lives.
3579 2019-06-20 00:33:31 Agree w/ Preston. A rise in alternatives to stocks, which offer superior returns but with a (somewhat) similar risk profile.
3580 2019-06-20 00:33:18 Stocks are up 33.2% under you. I think you meant Obama since the markets were up 55% during the same amount of months since you have been in office. We don’t count since Election Day.
3581 2019-06-20 00:33:08 Can’t believe you don’t use the apple stocks app... disappointing.
3582 2019-06-20 00:33:00 At what point do you stop being long stocks?
3583 2019-06-20 00:32:51 Odd no mention of the national debt skyrocketing under both Obama and Trump administrations.  Without the massive debt where would stocks really be???
3584 2019-06-20 00:32:47 Just so you know, THE STOCK MARKET IS NOT THE ECONOMY. And the top 10% by income own 84% of the stocks. Everybody else, 90%, own the other 16%. The last year of Obama's term, roughly the same jobs per month were created as your first 2 years (actually yours was slightly lower).
3585 2019-06-20 00:32:15 Hi Matt, I'm super happy!!! Thank you very much!!  I sold 1/4 like you recommended at 28 but then hit 75 and now went down to 65...Should we sell tomorrow? I would like to buy other CBD stocks from your list.
3586 2019-06-20 00:31:53 Trump Tweeted,
“Since Election Day 2016, Stocks up almost 50%, Stocks gained 9.2 Trillion Dollars in value, and more than 5,000,000 new jobs added to the Economy...”
What does Trump think
“Value” means?
3587 2019-06-20 00:31:45 Obama did triple and quadruple the people including himself that need to be in stocks and chains.
If not just a firing squad will work do.

3588 2019-06-20 00:30:48 These tweets will come back to bite you on Election Day 2020.  The economy will be in recession, and unless the Fed drops interest rates back to zero and does QE4, stocks could be lower on Election Day 2020 they were on Election Day 2016!
3589 2019-06-20 00:30:46 But stocks near all time highs doesn’t bother you?
3590 2019-06-20 00:30:18 We need Farmers and ranchers to be up and running!! We can not rely upon other countries for our food supply!!! I don't know about y'all, but I can't eat a hedge fund, annuities, or stocks!! We need more food, less housing developments!!!
3591 2019-06-20 00:30:11 Just bring soy or corn does not mean it is suitable for human consumption. Most cattle feed esp the grains you mention are not suitable for humans.
3592 2019-06-20 00:29:48 52% of American families own stocks directly or indirectly. Know that that means? 48% don’t give two shits about the stock market.

3597 2019-06-20 00:28:25 Who has money to buy stocks?  I know we don't, it's hard enough to keep food on the table and pay the mortgage, only the rich can benefit.

3600 2019-06-20 00:27:47 You do know the majority of people don't own stocks, don't you?
Also, having to work 2 jobs in order to make ends barely meet doesn't mean more jobs is the answer to our problems. 
How about better pay and benefits for everyday workers?
3601 2019-06-20 00:27:41 I know it’s hard @POTUS but try not to say something stupid tonight. We have to reach all time highs in the market tomorrow. #Stocks
3602 2019-06-20 00:27:41 Just took a look at a few stocks. DIS really showing some divergence...
3603 2019-06-20 00:27:41 Oh god I’m excited for the second series now but that ending killed me. One of the funniest episodes as well (the Chechnya lad building the stocks) and yet the ending
3604 2019-06-20 00:27:39 Not really? We can't predict something based on the probability of her winning. I think if it wasn't for the buyback of the stocks, the market would have crashed a long time ago.
3605 2019-06-20 00:27:27 My stocks are up a couple, playing with this money is too fun. if i go broke y’all know why 
3606 2019-06-20 00:27:10 Sir the Nifty stocks are doing ok. Have noticed that standard indicators which worked in the past are not working now. Can't remember a time. In. 30 years I have been in the markets where popular stocks are cratering while blue chips are being bought heavily
3607 2019-06-20 00:27:04 these alts are like penny stocks you should put a disclaimer or fine print, Some people have no idea..
3608 2019-06-20 00:27:03 Stocks haven't done anything in over a year.  They are barely back to their January 2018 high.  Another Trump lie based on his ignorance and stupidity.  Obama added same number of jobs that Trump did.  According to Forbes, Trump's job numbers are a continuation of Obama's trend.
3609 2019-06-20 00:26:39 That’s a bold lie. The money we have invested in stocks have gone down significantly just in the last year. I think we lost something like 5% on our investments. We actually have less now than we originally put in
3610 2019-06-20 00:26:16 You are all nuts! National Debt climbing every day!! Stocks are just now getting back to where they were 2 years ago!!!! Farmers Welfare, for botched trade deals! Hurricane disaster recovery is not happening etc...

3612 2019-06-20 00:26:04 US stocks rose on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged, as widely expected – with its key interest rate having been in a range of 2.25% to 2.5% since December
3613 2019-06-20 00:26:02 Not sure why they buy bonds when stocks go up everyday and are risk free. I can’t even remember the last down day in stocks at this point
3614 2019-06-20 00:25:59 Stocks up, Gold up, Bonds up, Bitcoin Up. The only way you aren't winning right now is if you are in cash or $BYND fake meat.
3615 2019-06-20 00:25:41 Stocks have been swinging around like crazy, and after you were elected, we had the biggest point drop in history on the dow.
3616 2019-06-20 00:25:30 Too bad most of us can't afford stocks.  How about a decent paying job?
3617 2019-06-20 00:25:07 This is BS. Trump has bankrupted farms with his irresponsible and ignorant views on tariffs. Tax cuts go to rich corporations not people. How many of you own stocks? If you don't they won't help you. He lost the popular vote, hes finished.
3618 2019-06-20 00:25:06 god help anyone investing in australian penny biotech stocks. you are beyond help.

3620 2019-06-20 00:24:18 Well, it's Obama's economy, but you will screw it up. And no stocks have taken several dumps. And the job report is nice but that going down with your tariffs, and companies moving and closing. And no, Clinton won. She would of never put this country in the trouble like you have.
3621 2019-06-20 00:24:16 Stocks did better under Obama.
3622 2019-06-20 00:24:16 Ever since Obama fixed that GOP Recession, Stocks have been rising since 2010. The rising market started well before 2016, this is just a continuation of previous administration. Any 12th grader could tell you that, Lou Dobbs/Trump. Donald has done nothing.
3623 2019-06-20 00:24:05 But it's a double edged sword hysterisis  and social media frenzy brings stocks down in no time, it's hard to be a investor these days. Has the old concept of research and sit tight changed?
3624 2019-06-20 00:24:00 Oh let's trade a good economy for our humanity and ethics.  
Who cares if racists run the government, so long as stocks are high.
Who cares if Nazis walk the streets, just give me those profits.
Who cares if fascism is back, I have a great retirement.
3625 2019-06-20 00:23:55 Addendum: Since you took office, stocks are only up 30%, and were stagnant in 2018.
3626 2019-06-20 00:23:45 No; I'm long stocks and 2-yr and 20-30-yr US Treasuries.....not long gold.
3627 2019-06-20 00:23:34 Do you want to compare Obama’s first 2 years vs yours?  Lol. Or how the stocks are doing this year?  Most of your supporters don’t even know what a stock is or what to do with it.  You’re a joke
3628 2019-06-20 00:23:26 If stocks are up why has my retirement account lost money?
3629 2019-06-20 00:23:19 U.S. stocks have gone nowhere since January 2018 when you launched the damaging trade conflicts
3630 2019-06-20 00:22:57 There is absolutely no way to fact check this statement as it is just conjecture. If your opponent had won stocks would be up 7,000% and 500 billion jobs would have been added. See, anyone can do it.
3631 2019-06-20 00:22:19 "84 percent of all stocks owned by Americans belong to the wealthiest 10 percent of households. That includes everyone's stakes in pensions, 401(k)'s and individual retirement accounts, as well as trust funds, mutual funds and college savings programs like 529 plans".Feb 8, 2018
3632 2019-06-20 00:21:45 Clarification: Stocks rose about 294% during the Obama administration from their market-crashing lows, and employment has actually slowed under your watch, meatbag. No one but partisan hacks suggest that the economy would have crashed if your opponent had won.

3681 2019-06-20 00:16:30 It's an indicator of our economy's success. Stocks aren't just for the rich. Any civilian can and should own shares of stock. Even if it's just passively through their employeer with a retirement account. We can all benefit from a stronger stock market.

3688 2019-06-20 00:15:58 “You finance guys are arrogant/rip people off/trying to crash the stock” blah blah blah. Why? Bc Wall St is sooo anti-making money? There’s no logic to it. Someone who clean doesn’t understand that most of Wall St exists to convince people to BUY stocks/bonds/etc.

3694 2019-06-20 00:15:42 There he goes again. Won't take credit when the markets nose dive because of his policies, but sure likes to brown nose when stocks are up.
3695 2019-06-20 00:15:42 Stocks are overvalued and we need a crash now!
3696 2019-06-20 00:15:42 He is being SARCASTIC, Anthony! He says "when stocks fall, it is my fault, so it is rising today because of the appointment of General Ramos (the relevant thing JB did today)". i.e. it isn't always his fault when stocks fall or due to him when they go up -- that's what he meant.
3697 2019-06-20 00:15:36 This has to be a joke!  You just proved that "Trickle Down Econ" doesn't work.  You passed a big tax cut to the 1%.  They took that money and bought stocks.  The market went up.  Meanwhile nothing was spent on investment, no new tax revenue resulted, and the deficit balloons.

3699 2019-06-20 00:15:35 I firmly believe that at the rallies they plant people to start the chants and then others pick up on it. I do believe the campaign stocks the audience with these folks. It's like Kool-Aid and red meat mixed together
3700 2019-06-20 00:15:32 You do realize that less than 25% of the American citizens own stocks.
This is a rich man’s game.
Not for the average American worker, who you care very little about.
All you do is break promises.....and lie, lie, and lie!

3703 2019-06-20 00:15:14 And what about the massive losses over the past year huh???? Stocks have not gained ANYTHING since January 2018!!!
3704 2019-06-20 00:15:11 Their children were sold like stocks--what kind of parents are these!?
3705 2019-06-20 00:15:10 Gonna be a rude awakening when Trump realizes stocks aren’t used to measure how well the country is doing.

3741 2019-06-20 00:08:12 If stocks, bonds and housing are at record bubble levels doesn't that imply cash is the most logical place to be at this moment?
3742 2019-06-20 00:07:25 Makes sense. I was thinking the lower vol was actually the benefit of run. Figured run vs pass was the trade off between higher expected return and lower vol (like stocks vs bonds).
3743 2019-06-20 00:06:54 Thats a really interesting point Mark, on a field fed with N from a legume pasture we can grow a hectare of wheat for 8000 loaves of bread on about 12 litres of diesel,, ie about .0015 ltr/loaf, but if someone burns a litre going down to the shops to buy one is 10,000 x that
