1 2018-08-21 23:59:41 Tip: You don't need an essential oil diffuser to obtain the benefits of the pure oils. EO's can be added to a container of bicarb, or simply placed on an absorbent cotton pad. Even inhaling the EO's directly from the bottle is effective...if the EO's are pure.

149 2018-08-21 23:46:21 Governments have the ability to make comprehensive plans for national reduction of enviromental discussion caused by crude oil, and the ability to invest in renewable energy and they do not, because oil makes them money
150 2018-08-21 23:46:03 I don't really care as you won't believe any of it anyways. Like Trump said:

151 2018-08-21 23:46:02 We're being TOTALLY accurate, Venezuela's problems started when the US, thru Saudi Arabia's influence in OPEC, Caused the price of oil to tumble. Which is problematic when crude is 80% of your country's economy. Exasperated  by the sanctions. Maduro was democratically elected
152 2018-08-21 23:45:55 Jimmy Carter 1976. "We are running out of oil & this is the biggest crisis man will ever face. We will be out if oil by the year 2000"
153 2018-08-21 23:45:55 Check your Transmission oil today.
154 2018-08-21 23:45:54 Oh shit I forgot about that! Rubbing lavender oil on my temples for sure helps me 
Thanks girl
155 2018-08-21 23:45:54 I got an oil stain in my favorite pair of slacks so I’m about to just burn my wardrobe.
156 2018-08-21 23:45:52 i think it was metal madness but oil ocean is a close contender
157 2018-08-21 23:45:48 Kapler playing infield in lmfaooo. He baaically tells us everything u have learned about baseball throw it out the window and rub one out with coconut oil while i shout percentages...
158 2018-08-21 23:45:46 昨晩は無様な姿をお見せして申し訳って感じ
159 2018-08-21 23:45:41 Ewww. Castor oil was something I could never bring myself to do. Just get up and move around. Even though you don’t want to lol
160 2018-08-21 23:45:22 ぽきまざ〜〜
161 2018-08-21 23:45:21 The answer is in there, they are not necessarily all non believer's, just deniers because that is the line that their supporters (big coal & oil etc.) demand from them for the bucks. So scum on one hand, idiots on the other.
162 2018-08-21 23:45:18 Transmission fluid is the special oil used in the hydraulic transmission unit of your car.
163 2018-08-21 23:45:15 Lorenzo's oil.
164 2018-08-21 23:45:11 King of the mountain. Midnight oil
165 2018-08-21 23:45:09 We may leave some fairly easy coal in the ground forever, but I doubt we'll leave any fairly easy crude oil in the ground. Instant gratification trumps being kind to generations yet unborn.
166 2018-08-21 23:45:08 but a small carb load can simply be lots of vegetables with butter or olive oil, right? or a small piece of a low sugar fruit? would that suffice?
167 2018-08-21 23:45:03 I never set out to make a 'comprehensive plan' as I'm not an enviromental scientist, or have anything to do with enviromental science as a career. 

Any kind of call for reduction of production/refinement of crude oil is important activism. Governments need to come up with plans
168 2018-08-21 23:44:56 まざ
169 2018-08-21 23:44:49 Bullshit. Alberta has the highest environmental laws of any oil producing county
170 2018-08-21 23:44:46 When your phone tells you that there is a “warning issued for Americans that use coconut oil...” I’m just questioning life at this point!!?  #strongsideeye
171 2018-08-21 23:44:43 She should perhaps clarify what day is the best day ever, because it's every day as she has it now.
172 2018-08-21 23:44:37 Coconut oil? Seriously? You can’t be talking about the nut of coco
173 2018-08-21 23:44:35 Probably going to drink pineapple/castor oil smoothies and sit on my exercise ball until she comes. Lol
174 2018-08-21 23:44:32 My original recipe I call Pasta alla buona. Olive oil, capers, pine nuts, and diced tomatoes over pasta.

177 2018-08-21 23:43:44 At 7: 

The latest on the #Manafortverdict & #CohenPleaDeal - @JoaquinCastrotx weighs in from Washington
+ @HCookAustin & @HGildemeister are in with reaction
+ the state could be looking at a new kind of 'oil' boom to help fuel its economy - we'll explain
178 2018-08-21 23:43:39 Yep. It’s full of vegetable oil
179 2018-08-21 23:43:34 I've started going to the gym the past couple of weeks and taking some vitamins (b, d, and fish oil) & I can def say that this has been starting to help with the dreadful thoughts and anxiety 
180 2018-08-21 23:43:29 Is that oil on the bowl?
Hha! Poor bastards getting baked likes cakes, stay up

Got an j myself; sparking in honor take it easy.
181 2018-08-21 23:43:25 Look at all the actors @realDonaldTrump paid to show up at his huckster & snake oil presentation!
182 2018-08-21 23:43:21 lavender oil 4 the win
183 2018-08-21 23:43:16 the most annoying level for me is Oil Ocean
184 2018-08-21 23:43:14 really?  coconut oil is used very often in my country Vietnam and Thailand as well
185 2018-08-21 23:43:08 You said somebody accused you of drug use...I can see why someone would think that. Come back some other time...after you return to reality.
186 2018-08-21 23:43:05 Que olor a gas oil y a aceite que tenia, me pegue un baño tremendooooo
187 2018-08-21 23:43:02 Dilute apple cider vinegar in water (3/4 water 1/4 vinegar) with some tea tree oil and TINY bit of isopropyl alcohol and use as a toner!! Almost completely got rid of my acne !
188 2018-08-21 23:42:57 Do you realise how much is given in tax subsidises to oil companies?

If you were actually consistent you’d want to make sure this country you seem to like wasn’t dependent on kleptocratic regimes like Saudi Arabia…

Green technology means an end to the power base of despots…
189 2018-08-21 23:42:54 If you suffer from intense period pain.. Please invest in evening primrose oil been taking it for two months, my first period after a week of taking it i had a few twtiches here and there and my last period i had NO pain whatsoever. the first time ever! not a single cramp
190 2018-08-21 23:42:45 Why not. Oil is the perfect conduit frankly. You could deep fry everything and make it heaven. And onvi batter you just infuse the butter. I'm 1000% yes.
191 2018-08-21 23:42:41 Odio el olor a nafta, gas oil, aceite, y todos los fluidos que aumentan cada 15 días
192 2018-08-21 23:42:38 Red ..always red..lots of oil
193 2018-08-21 23:42:33 Brngng bad coal as an energy source is like bringing back whaling for whale oil!
194 2018-08-21 23:42:32 Could have he been the person they had who pumped out the oil in order to get the girls out??? I’ve thought that as well
195 2018-08-21 23:42:31 Just look at the revolution happening in the EV space. Government is nowhere to be seen! Our hight-tech EV industries are being hamstrung by ALL political parties who are in the pockets of big COAL and OIL players. Either that or they simply have their heads in the sand!!!
196 2018-08-21 23:42:29 PSA: do NOT eat coconut oil!! A study has determined that it is practically POISON to CONSUME!! Please be safe guys!!
197 2018-08-21 23:42:16 Why do you end the season so early?
198 2018-08-21 23:42:09 Trying to keep it in perspective. A grandfather mourns his daughter & granddaughters being strangled/hidden in oil vats. A family mourns daughter whose body has been in a cornfield, her killer “blacked out.” And 100s of kids at the border are still without parents.
199 2018-08-21 23:42:06 Ketchup,mayo,mustard,dressing,oil and vinegar and chocolate syrup.
200 2018-08-21 23:42:06 Just got a notification from my News app that Americans should stay away from Coconut oil. 

Basically studies have proven that it’s literally poision and one of the WORST things you can eat. 

Can’t believe once upon a time we all used to overhype coconut oil.
201 2018-08-21 23:41:25 VRCの影響か、まだ腰に違和感が
202 2018-08-21 23:41:24 should i buy an essential oil diffuser
203 2018-08-21 23:41:12 ぽきた
204 2018-08-21 23:41:12 neither oil nor oil
205 2018-08-21 23:41:10 Unless you're the one being murdered by an illegal alien that shouldn't be here to begin with. At that point the threat level of what you call "white Americans" is totally unimportant to you.
206 2018-08-21 23:40:57 If you did your research youd find that said founder of the united socialist party of venezuela hugo chavez made the country way better under socialism and its bc oil prices plumetted that venezuela is in crisis also bc maduro is actually a dictator by now
207 2018-08-21 23:40:40 仕事に疲れた時は甘い物がいいって言うよな！え…このプリン、ナルルちゃんのだったのか…(｀ω´;;)
208 2018-08-21 23:40:37 Ok, I can't endorse this, but it *does* make some intellectual sense. Fat makes things taste good and oil always ends up separating from the sauce. Maybe an emulsion like mayo would help bring things together like with salad dressing?
209 2018-08-21 23:40:26 How are you gonna drive your car without fuel, plastics, oils, or lubricants? Not to mention heat your home, turn the lights on, use your phone, the list goes on. You can’t have any of these things without oil and gas.
210 2018-08-21 23:40:19 油を固めて捨てるの面倒でしょう？僕に渡してくれたらいいよ。あ、固めて渡してくれてもいいよ。
211 2018-08-21 23:40:15 You would have to ask @Richard1quinlan why there is Biopest in the procym and not the Aviator, but the key message I was pushing in this post was that Aviator  is safe with UAN and NS. I am comfortable that Aviator (EC formulation) doesn't need an oil for canopy penetration.
212 2018-08-21 23:40:11 As I demonstrated above, OPEC's effectiveness is slim to nil. Wall Street & Big Oil have since 2001 controlled & manipulated a completely financialised market. From 1st July 2017 the market entered a new #EnergyDominance paradigm
213 2018-08-21 23:40:11 @Dodge I signed up for Twitter to make this post - My 2014 Dart recently broke down due to a plastic shifter cable breaking. My car was in your hands for 41 days, which forced me to walk to & from work. Afterwards, you returned my car to me with NO OIL IN IT. Do NOT buy @Dodge
214 2018-08-21 23:40:10 Wow why has it taken me so long to discover oil cleansers?? Do yourself a favour and try one if you haven’t.
215 2018-08-21 23:40:09 @bigfatsurprise “Coconut oil is pure poison,” the Harvard professor, Dr. Karin Michels, said. 
Have you killed me? Well, at least I felt better before I died, and my T2D didn't get me, lol.
216 2018-08-21 23:40:05 @hshirazi78. Dr. S I have believed for some time with us no longer dependent on the Gulf's oil that the US actually IS or WAS trying to get out of the region. Reasons:
1. Oil Glut
2. Presence is very expensive
3. Changing mil-tech means
4.  People don't like us
Your Thoughts?
217 2018-08-21 23:39:56 Netlfix should package all the Trump rallies together into a season.  Such good TV !!  People would binge watch all day long.  So much positivity, so much hope, so much positive change.  They could toss the villians Hillary Clinton, Maxine Water, and Peosi in for spice. @FoxNews

219 2018-08-21 23:39:47 There was a video on Facebook of this man stirring oil down like soup. Lord ppl were having a field day in them comments
220 2018-08-21 23:39:43 Would you please repeat that?  I can’t hear you over the wails & moans of starving Venezuelans, you know, the country sitting on earth’s largest proven oil reserves...yet another nation that the cancer of socialism destroyed?

Frigging chuckleheads 
221 2018-08-21 23:39:24 Emm, Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off buildings. Obstructing Transmountain only enriches dictators. @vancouverpride @uvicpride
222 2018-08-21 23:39:23 Is that a euphemism? Cuz I ain't had my oil changed in a long time.
223 2018-08-21 23:39:22 I’ve been baking salmon in avocado oil recently and it’s so good someone gimme a cooking show.
224 2018-08-21 23:39:14 And the whote dude that brutally murdered his family then threw his dead children's bodies in an oil tank?
225 2018-08-21 23:39:00 Aaaah vale entonces espera @coconutdrama primo por que canola oil cuando canola hair? Que te pasa?
226 2018-08-21 23:38:52 Beto: An Irish-American pretending to be Hispanic without one accomplishment to his name. He'll vote with Pelosi & Schumer to raise taxes and end oil drilling. Keep Texas Jobs. #KeepTexasRed #TedCruz

228 2018-08-21 23:38:45 the quadrupling of oil prices caused by the Arab Oil Embargo in 1973 certainly didn't help either, but your thesis is right, in my view.
229 2018-08-21 23:38:39 We're making it with chili oil tomorrow too (:<
230 2018-08-21 23:38:31 Somebody bring me some oil!

234 2018-08-21 23:37:57 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
235 2018-08-21 23:37:32 Well thats just a load of shit. Historically speaking, school shooters a young white dudes. So... I mean. 

Now care to comment on the american man who murdered his pregnant wife and two duaghters then threw them in an oil tank?
236 2018-08-21 23:37:24 I knew they would. It is a gift to them. Very sad story but have they covered the white father who killed his whole family...put his little girls’ bodies in a vat of oil? Not much I bet.
237 2018-08-21 23:37:14 Don't want to splurge on oil blotting sheets? Take a thin toilet-paper square and use it to blot excess oil on your T-zone.
238 2018-08-21 23:37:07 You are a sad person--call me whatever you wish--I don't give a rat's ass--does it make you feel better? Are you going to show your grandbabies how you insulted the evil terrorist? What is your endgame?
239 2018-08-21 23:37:05 Grab some fresh tomatoes and a bottle of our Sun-dried Tomato and Basil Infused Olive Oil this weekend at Wilson Farm's Tomato Fest and you can make this recipe!  #KitchenWitch #DipEatLove
240 2018-08-21 23:37:05 oil portrait of bayonetta and dante clasping hands while killing demons and where their hands clasp its labeled "being gay"
241 2018-08-21 23:36:57 Oh no! Why does it always feel like recipes either radically over or understate the amount of oil needed, but never actually nail it?
242 2018-08-21 23:36:55 Just asked the store employee what oil vegetable aisle is in
243 2018-08-21 23:36:49 I will risk my life to protect the RIGHT for: clean water, clean air, clean food, set back limits of 2500ft near any buildings and people, stop all current oil wells, end all new oil & gas projects, and make a just and equitable transition to 100% Green Renewable Energies NOW!
244 2018-08-21 23:36:39 Next time rub vegetable oil before you start it will prevent your hands from hurting
245 2018-08-21 23:36:21 Y’all went to war for oil. Keep it real
246 2018-08-21 23:36:16 She hasn't been beheaded yet.  Her trial will conclude in Oct.  This doesn't excuse the barbarity of the Saudi regime or their filthy Wahabbi extremist lapdogs.  We need to stop enabling this terrorist regime and find alternative sources of oil, like Canada.
247 2018-08-21 23:36:12 Just spilt an entire bottle of essential oil in my kitchen... but at least my house smells like lavender 
248 2018-08-21 23:36:11 I’m carefully typing this with oily fingers LOL I am just about done filming but I’ve got a bit more to do and I need to shower after since there’s a lot of oil involved hehe soooo I’m going to be a bit late to cam 

I’m thinking more like 6pm instead of 5pm
249 2018-08-21 23:36:11 okay, I don’t use coconut oil as a substitute for other fats, I just like it.  Homemade magic shell is one of my little tricks in the kitchen, and I can’t do it without coconut oil.  Fuck it, I’m still using it.
250 2018-08-21 23:36:10 guess who got their oil pen to work again? we going  sky high 
251 2018-08-21 23:36:02 I spent my 20s working on the deck of an oil tanker during winter in the Gulf of Alaska, and deployed in combat zones around the world... Today is the first day since then I have truly been fearful. 

...and I am fearful of what the current president will do...
252 2018-08-21 23:35:47 They’re like oil and water
253 2018-08-21 23:35:43 Everybody on the planet swears by coconut oil for dry hair, but macadamia is my game changer
254 2018-08-21 23:35:41 Por que cabello = pelo = hair
Oil = aceite ????? Camila aceite????
255 2018-08-21 23:35:41 I feel bad for vegans not being able to use baby oil when they cook. Very inexpensive and exquisite
256 2018-08-21 23:35:29 Nobody takes more selfies on the job than a nigga in the oil field.
257 2018-08-21 23:35:19 Getting my oil changed and my lease is up in a couple months so why not test drive cars while I wait?
258 2018-08-21 23:35:18 That is awesome...we have a mystic shop nearby, sells CBD Oil, other oils, healing rocks...etc...my daughter is transitioning out of Case Management and I think I am going to take her and let her pick her own out. Great idea!
259 2018-08-21 23:35:00 Agreed. And I’m a huge believer in climate change. I try and do my part but we have to get our oil to market, for now.
260 2018-08-21 23:34:54 This man needs swift and maximum justice. But not all illegals are murderers, which is the snake oil you’re selling. Oh Jakey, there is NEVER going to be a “wall.”  We DO want safe and humane borders. Hopefully like those that awaited many of our immigrant ancestors.
261 2018-08-21 23:34:25 It's funny how white people can be so convinced that there's a finite amount of:
- money
- human rights
- intellectual ability
And yet bloody certain of infinite amounts of:
- oil
- ability of our biosphere to handle contaminants
- elephants
- economic opportunity at zero cost.

266 2018-08-21 23:33:55 He does not allow free speech. He constantly calls  the press ENEMY of the people.  Does care for gun control. He is allowing POISEN in our streams and air. COAL and oil old news. It is for his rich friends. I can not handle YOU anymore he is not a respectable person. Womanizers

270 2018-08-21 23:32:57 White oil or no? That's the real question.
271 2018-08-21 23:32:56 And also - your analogy is a terrible failure. The money came from oil sales prior to the 1979 revolution. It is money belonging to the Iranian state. I don't like the govt in Tehran any more than you do but calling it a payment is a lie.
272 2018-08-21 23:32:49 Why not? Is there oil or minerals in S Cameroon that French Cameroon wants?
273 2018-08-21 23:32:48 School started yesterday. So far we've run out of cooking oil, pizza crusts, and sliced black olives, and some Einstein stuck tongs in the banana pudding to serve it.
274 2018-08-21 23:32:38 Oil is a volatile asset. Opec tries to smoothe the price swings but its effectiveness is nos 100pct. So what ? Where are you trying to get ?
275 2018-08-21 23:32:37 As he lie to them, EPA and Land mgmt is working for FRACKER & OIL. DRILLERS, also pass tax change to allow coal owners to write off more of the cost of new machinery to replace them.
276 2018-08-21 23:32:32 Not really Russia have a quiet impressive sovergein wealth fund when they raise it’s retirement age above lives expectancy (add in Russia have a boatload of oil revenue  from 2000-2014).
They have the money they just picky.
277 2018-08-21 23:32:19 Mind you, there are also born and bred Canadians who don't want our oil to market with pretty good reason. We need to take pretty dramatic action on climate change.
278 2018-08-21 23:32:02 My father was a tool and die maker and worked 50 hours a week until the age of 75. His hands were in acid, heavy oil and metal shavings all day. I never rememberer a time when his nails weren’t black. The stain was permanent. I never thought negatively or twice about it.

284 2018-08-21 23:31:36 What about the nice white dad who killed his pregnant wife and 2 littled daughters. That monster put the dead girls in an oil drum and buried his pregnant wife. He was having an affair. Not defending the immigrant. Both he and that dad should get the death penalty.
285 2018-08-21 23:31:28 Don’t be fooled. The people who own the stocks and reap the profits from the electric car companies and solar panel makers are the same ones who own the coal mines and oil wells. The appearance that these industries are actively at odds is simply theatre.
286 2018-08-21 23:31:22 Venezuela continues to possess the world’s largest oil reserves. If you don’t have the wherewithal to tap them, you are a friend to tree huggers.

291 2018-08-21 23:30:42 I have been using this oil on myself for the past 4 years and found it to be extremely effective! I take 1 gram per day 5 days a week. I put the oil into a gel capsule and eat it or I put the oil in to a smoothie and blend it. Most people Heat their oil which activates it.I don't

Final answer...?
The walls are closing in.
Do you have enough oil?

296 2018-08-21 23:30:20 Hay Tammy!  What about that white Christian guy that killed his wife, strangled his baby girls and dumped their bodies in vats of crude oil.  Are you 3 times as outraged over that?  Yeah, no.
297 2018-08-21 23:30:19 im choosing to bake my frozen food instead of frying it. this is #growth. also i ran out of oil to fry it in
298 2018-08-21 23:30:03 Manafort, Michael Cohen, Duncan Hunter...not a good day for the human-droid arm of the Decepticon Forces!

301 2018-08-21 23:29:40 So this exchange just happened while getting my oil changed,

Employee: would you like your tire pressure checked?
Me: no thanks, I checked it recently, it should be good
E: are you sure? 
Me: yes I’m sure...
E: *proceeds to check all my tires anyway* they’re good.

305 2018-08-21 23:29:01 Tea tree oil and Lush’s cup o’ coffee scrub work for me :)
306 2018-08-21 23:29:01 Hello! We recommend washing in cold water with soap and you can follow up with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer or coconut oil.
307 2018-08-21 23:29:00 If you want to expose dark money go no further than George Soros who creates chaos for profit and power only.  Kochs are all about business, jobs, creating products.  Of course they invest in the third largest reservoir of oil.  Why shouldn't they?
308 2018-08-21 23:28:40 Between 2011 and 2015, the @GEJonathan Administration earned $393 billion only in oil revenues but nothing to show. In the last three years the Buhari Administration has earned only $94 billion in oil revenues but with massive infrastructure to show

310 2018-08-21 23:28:29 The Altona Refinery is a blight on the West of Melbourne. Spewing pollution and odours 24 hours a day, ruining the air quality for 100,000s of people for the benefit of a multinational oil company. Fossil fuels are a dying industry and the sooner the refinery closes the better.
311 2018-08-21 23:28:25 Potential reasons might include:
1. Oil price is still relatively benign
2. yield curve has not yet inverted
3. Market is rising
312 2018-08-21 23:28:21 Turkey first target will be it’s oil supplier.
Let’s say... 2nd target?
313 2018-08-21 23:28:18 Not trying to do a setup Joe. I’d really like to know why we would pump oil all the way across Canada so it can be exported when the Trans Mountain route would be much shorter. Environmental risks for both. I assume the longer the route the greater the risk.

335 2018-08-21 23:25:19 I appreciate the thought you have put into this thread, and I understand that oil is used for lots of different things, I just think the environmental effects are too bad to continue refining and using it, and governments need to find renewable alternatives
336 2018-08-21 23:25:09 That murder was here in my hometown, Frederick Colorado. Killed his wife and 2 little girls, threw them in oil barrels and burued his wife nearby in a shallow grave.
337 2018-08-21 23:25:03 That's to scary to think about.
We have to make oil and gas illegal or turn Thorium Nuclear in a couple years and make oil/ gas expensive antiques.
338 2018-08-21 23:25:02 So, a guy sees his wife murdering the a second child as the first lay dead nearby.. guy kills his wife. Guy packs three bodies and heads out. He buries his murderous wife and stashes the girls in oil tanks. I would make it into a novel but I'd struggle with verisimilitude.

356 2018-08-21 23:22:42 Trump is saying in times of conflict wind turbines, solar panels, and oil can be destroyed. Coal can't be. We love clean coal.

To be clear: love coal because it can't be destroyed during war like renewable energy.

357 2018-08-21 23:22:40 Olive oil should go in everything.

385 2018-08-21 23:19:13 I kno u weren’t asking me, but I love both. Rosehip is my fave face oil. I use it for cupping and add it to my moisturizer in the winter or if it’s being problematic.

412 2018-08-21 23:14:59 Kinda feel like the amount of money I put into my truck with the gas, oil, etc.. I could probably afford a car payment. I really gotta look for a used vehicle that is good on gas.

442 2018-08-21 23:10:44 Imagine how much oil was used in the production of those "green energy" products.
443 2018-08-21 23:10:36 I use coconut oil just as much as vegetable oil. It’s still saturated fat either way. Same as butter.
444 2018-08-21 23:10:28 I use canola oil for my cast iron pan. It’s great! The worst oils for the body is great for coating pans and cleaning in general

455 2018-08-21 23:09:28 Shouldn’t you be more concerned about staying out of jail?! This snake oil salesman is attempting to distract his foolish followers from his many crimes. Easily done, they’re all morons or a part of his shady empire. Let me guess, all you heard was empire?
456 2018-08-21 23:09:22 Well it wouldn’t be so bad if I didn’t drive as much as I do. Oil changes are every 10k miles. Problem is I put 10k miles on it in 4 months. Dealership asked me if I go out of town a lot. F*ck no! I wish. I work too damn much. Only drove out of state twice in this car.
457 2018-08-21 23:09:02 But sis, don't it apply both ways? There's females looking for a WHOLE ready made man when they ain't finished that 30 day hot oil treatment. Shouldn't it be based on a connection rather than "pay grade"?

459 2018-08-21 23:08:55 You should be happy how complacent the US is towards Saudi Arabia supporting your war crimes against Yemen.  You folks are going to be shit out of luck when alternatives to oil become more financially feasible.

483 2018-08-21 23:06:10 well it depends with oil gas you would need a steady flow, but with air gas then its a matter of minutes, however the garage has some holes as the light shines though, make sure to clog them up or else we can't get an accurate time.

I say impossible until the CNY freely floats and is traded on every monetary exchange in the world.

Never mind one other tidbit: China (of all the big countries) has no oil and is entirely dependent on others to supply them.

581 2018-08-21 22:54:18 I would submit Jerabek will be more important in the line up than either Ennis or Duclair.  Oil seem to overpay though at times, no doubt.

585 2018-08-21 22:53:54 That 1929 location is where most of the oil ships out from today. The José Terminal. So close to ground zero.
586 2018-08-21 22:53:30 That's the second rumor of Saudi oil money for an electric car company.

604 2018-08-21 22:51:16 I don’t think it’s a big deal that a white man wants to cook jerk chicken I think people fail to recognise that #JamieOliver can’t cook for shit! He can’t season white peoples chicken nor can he season Caribbean chicken. gallons of Olive oil is not flavour
605 2018-08-21 22:51:16 In line with what was being stated by 2/3 people, there is very little work possible in #Tripolitania, as a whole.  Do not know how many WANT to work.  ATM water, electricity making life hell in #Tripoli.  The oil fields are up and down, trying to run in #Barqah, not good signs
606 2018-08-21 22:51:08 you know who saved the whales, don't you? 
Last half of 19th century, whales were facing extinction. But,
Rockefeller lowered the price of kerosene below the price of whale oil & drove the whalers out of business.. but you probably hate the free market for saving the whales.
607 2018-08-21 22:51:02 This Fucking Man Killed His Pregnant Wife & 2Daughters , Burried The Wife Put The Kids In Oil TanksHow Could You Be So Heartless
608 2018-08-21 22:50:33 It’s such a lie that Chris Watts didn’t kill his daughters as well as his pregnant wife. If he didn’t murder them why would he put them in oil filled drums instead of calling the police when he supposedly found his wife killing their daughters?
609 2018-08-21 22:50:26 Thank you so much
 Really appreciate.
610 2018-08-21 22:50:19 The failure in Venezuela of universal healthcare are directly related to a corrupt govt!

611 2018-08-21 22:50:12 That time I ran into a woman shopping at Crossroads and she smelled like patchouli and mint and I stopped her and asked her what fragrance she was wearing and she said "just patchouli oil" and I said "but it also smells like mint" and she said "I'm chewing gum"

630 2018-08-21 22:46:35 Chris Watts should be strung up by his gonads, beaten senseless and left to die in an oil drum like he did to his family. Instead he’ll get a cushy cell. The illegal who killed Mollie deserves the same fate of Watts.

633 2018-08-21 22:46:02 Mollie Tibbetts murder is heartbreaking but don't turn this into an immigration issue. Women are murdered every day in this country by legal citizens. Chris Watts put his children in oil drums after strangling them and their mother. No one is up in arms about Colorado fathers.

646 2018-08-21 22:43:36 You could do veggie based ‘meat’.  The zoodles are the best part.  I just fast saute over high heat with s&p and a bit of mint.  I use macadamia nut oil and a tiny bit of sesame seed oil.
647 2018-08-21 22:43:34 There's something so poetic about masturbating with extra virgin olive oil.
648 2018-08-21 22:43:25 I’m sure lemongrass is now my favorite essential oil.
649 2018-08-21 22:43:19 #fracking we can change produced water that comes fracked well into distilled water. Oil companies will make huge amounts from the oil recovered and make thousands of good jobs. Help make injection wells illegal to save our health. RT

656 2018-08-21 22:42:16 Do you feel the same way about the white man who was recently arrested for killing his pregnant wife and two small children and hiding them in oil? Do you feel the same way about the white man that killed the young girl after he screamed "Jesus is coming"?

2. The PKK is not armed by the US, it actively provides drone images +intelligence that goes towards murdering & bombing dozens of people. YPG is not identical to PKK.

680 2018-08-21 22:38:43 Why yes, the gearbox is toast. Why? Gee, maybe because there was no oil in it. The gears require lube, the bearings require lube, no lube=no bearings. No bearings=slipping gears. Slipping gears=no up and down. No up and down=no water.
#windmillprobs #wellmanprobs #oilyourmills
681 2018-08-21 22:38:37 Law of 1 price.  Oil can’t be 2 different prices in CNY & USD, adjusting for CNY/USD x-rate.  If it is, 1 of 3 things must happen:

1. CNY/USD x-rate must adjust.

2. Oil flows must adjust.

3. US must sanction any oil exporter willing to sell in CNY out of the mkt.

684 2018-08-21 22:38:06 John, it's very clear from the comments that you've made about Bitfi that you're either a liar or willfully ignorant of the technical details. People have been using sham bounties and cracking contests to market snake oil security products for decades. Bitfi is still insecure.

689 2018-08-21 22:37:09 “Forgive debt”? Child support for the crap side of the eu equation/geography. Alimony payments for any “winner” country dumb enough to believe Brussels/Bundesbank snake oil promises to stick around.

694 2018-08-21 22:36:26 Fair comment m8,there are no known side affects from the oil,only good reports .hope you conquer this 
695 2018-08-21 22:36:16 Yes, made me feel so helpless. I’m glad the CBD oil is working. 
696 2018-08-21 22:36:13 Is there an experation date on snake oil, Donald? Because it  looks like you are all sold out and recycling the old stuff may be a lot less potent these days.

698 2018-08-21 22:35:35 #fracking The major problem with #fracking is the produced water that causes earthquakes and contaminated aquifers . We can change that bad water into distilled water and make money for oil companies and good-paying jobs while doing so. Outlaw injection wells
699 2018-08-21 22:35:28 The package label says the cookies contain wheat and corn flour, fructose and soybean oil. Maybe Midwestern farmers wouldn’t mind if the cookie sales increased after Mondelez decided to change its package.
700 2018-08-21 22:35:23 It is grieving time not for political statements. Community should stand behind family,but not pouring oil on fire and blaming all immigrants. These are dangerous moments where bcz of emotions some ppl can do things that will regret later.
701 2018-08-21 22:35:22 Mix it with whole grain mustard, cider vini, oil and Salt. Then use it as an amazing condiment for beef tartar

706 2018-08-21 22:34:56 Reality: From 2000-2017 Russia's GDP increased 7x, from $200 billion to $1500 billion (only a handful of countries increased by more). Since 2005 life expectancy has increased by 7 years to all-time high. Oil & gas are only 15% of GDP.
707 2018-08-21 22:34:26 Do not watch that shit and never stay at Hyatt Hotels.
708 2018-08-21 22:34:26 Someone needs to tell Maduro to start trading oil for silver shipments and create a separate currency backed by the silver.  Like Lincoln did to self finance the civil war with the Greenbacks.
709 2018-08-21 22:34:14 I seen this idiot cooking with coconut oil the other day, I was like bitch why you moisturizing your frying pan
710 2018-08-21 22:34:09 I keep hearing about CBD oil, I should look into it.
711 2018-08-21 22:33:46 they're not quite the same but I guess yeah...how quick we forget (about gmo vegetable oil nomenclature)

713 2018-08-21 22:33:24 Aw. I’m using CBD oil which is working okay. It’s awful to watch their anxiety.
714 2018-08-21 22:33:20 and rose hip seed oil by the ordinary. and then i use the simple brand face wash and toner and cleanser. there’s a LOT of products lol but they’ve all really helped one way or another

717 2018-08-21 22:33:14 Could you, Luke, or another good samaritans please elaborate on how exactly China would use the CNY oil contract to intervene with the CNY/USD ratio?
718 2018-08-21 22:33:06 Discussion now on gasoline and oil tax.

The proposed budget would raise the gas tax by 2 cents.
719 2018-08-21 22:32:57 The answer lies in the phrase 'Liberal conservative'.  It's a bit like 'oil water'.
720 2018-08-21 22:32:52 Can I just graduate already so I can sell my soul to an oil company @BP_plc @exxonmobil what’s up, y’all hiring?!?
721 2018-08-21 22:32:04 Its worse. Take Venezuela, please! LOL. They have the most oil reserves on earth. Greater than Saudis or anyone else & we offer to be their friends, to help them be free, yet they choose Socialism & blame us... and now the average citizen has lost 19 lbs in the past yr. Starving
722 2018-08-21 22:31:32 Does that mean baby oil is made out of babies ????
723 2018-08-21 22:31:26 It’s bullshit that cars are so expensive n I still have to change the oil n out gas in it
724 2018-08-21 22:31:05 They must have calculated  they don't need our oil or gas
725 2018-08-21 22:31:00 Big homie told me to get my oil changed early.
726 2018-08-21 22:30:56 Destroyed oil economy in Alberta, introduced a carbon tax Canadians can't pay, ignored our vets & native people, set up an infrastructure bank that will propel us into bankruptcy, opened up our borders to illegal migrants here for social services, terrorist roam our streets...etc

731 2018-08-21 22:30:29 4....from full weight of international censure. As ISIS rose he maintained a working relationship with them, often buying gas, oil and electricity. Putin seized the opportunity to gain greater power in MENA and assisted Assad in starving and slaughtering civilians into submission
732 2018-08-21 22:30:28 I guess that’s more profitable for someone. But at what cost to the climate? How much CO2 world wide would be saved if we just used our oil at home?

737 2018-08-21 22:29:58 Olive oil, fresh clams, light mozz, basil, thin crust cooked in a wood fire oven, a little lemon juice, there is almost nothing better.
738 2018-08-21 22:29:47 Ugh I wish I'd known this taking vaseline with me would've been easy. I usually use coconut oil so 
739 2018-08-21 22:29:34 PM’s visit to China has been very successful. Billions of investment from China are successfully secured, our palm oil export to China is also gaining momentum. Congratulation to our PM. This is Malaysia Baharu.

741 2018-08-21 22:29:07 What about that wholesome looking white guy that killed his pregnant wife & two little girls then buried them in an oil field? 

The girls were found in oil filled drums!

I didn’t see any anger about that, Corey!

746 2018-08-21 22:28:41 I can't believe people use coconut oil as lube
747 2018-08-21 22:28:32 Maybe! Like olive oil, lots of fraud.
748 2018-08-21 22:28:28 Somethings really wrong if we export oil on CO2 belching tankers, and at the same time import gasoline from the US.
749 2018-08-21 22:28:04 I just got so hype walking downstairs to make some brownies.... I open the pantry & WE DONT HAVE ANY OIL!!! I am on the edge I swear
750 2018-08-21 22:27:54 When is this government going after the thieves that sold off our oil reserves?
751 2018-08-21 22:27:54 This is not a surprise; he's a grifter and knows that to be a fan of his relentless BS, you must be a gullible moron who is easily suckered into snake oil.
752 2018-08-21 22:27:52 Venezuela’s problem go far beyond Chavez’s socialist reforms. It’s failed to diversify away from oil econ, budding dictatorship leading to sanctions & a series of failed inflationcontrol measures. Please speak to policies the DSAs proposed that would lead to Maduro like collapse.
753 2018-08-21 22:27:47 The less products made using oil = less reliance in the Saudis for oil = politicians can challenge Saudi human rights abuses more fearlessly as less threat of them withdrawing supplies = good for environment & human rights = we need more environmental laws, not less@BorisJohnson

760 2018-08-21 22:26:21 @RomanMcAllen #fracking #injection_well We need fracking to support our democratic way of life. We don't need an injection well if we can deal with produced water. We can turn produced water into distilled water, and make even more money for oil companies, and good paying jobs.
761 2018-08-21 22:26:18 He does not deserve a fair trail.
Throw him into the oil pit and close it. Just like he did his daughters.
Done. Forget him!!
762 2018-08-21 22:25:53 Just an FYI, oil changes for diesels are super expensive.  13+qts of oil adds up quick.
763 2018-08-21 22:25:43 On the road again. One of my anxieties is groceries while traveling.

773 2018-08-21 22:24:34 Black Jamaican castor oil. Used it religiously and also didn’t braid my edges
774 2018-08-21 22:24:27 The socialism in Venezuela was corrupt as hell, plus they only had one major resource so when the price of oil dropped they had nothing to turn to, the us has multiple industry's to lean on when one isn't booming like the other
775 2018-08-21 22:24:20 My heart goes out to the economic refugees of Venezuela. No bullets were fired or blood was shed, but a political crisis has bought a whole country to its knees.
Was it short-sighted to underpin your economy on oil?
776 2018-08-21 22:24:17 Folk have to get the dead flies out of your oil! They’re making your attitude stink!

781 2018-08-21 22:23:41 Gosh! Have they discovered vast reserves of oil? They’d better be  careful, lest they wind up like Libya, Venezuela and one or two others  who thought this ditching the US dollar lark may be a good idea.
782 2018-08-21 22:23:34 Haste ye hame to the South East. The too wee, poor and stupid, Greece without the sun basket case, inventors of the modern world, Scotland, are taking back control of our future, oil, renewables, land, fishing waters (including re-drawn territory). Holiday visa bookings welcome.
783 2018-08-21 22:23:09 Not at all, as long as you're acknowledging they're selling snake oil to their followers who, surprise surprise, turn out to be largely gullible boomers.
784 2018-08-21 22:22:43 It’s canola oil, not mayo. 

Also, my article for next week is tentatively titled, “Millennials are killing Magic.” You’ll be shocked why they’re doing it!  It’s a Top 5 list with each reason in a separate link!
785 2018-08-21 22:22:18 Not for money. Not for oil!
786 2018-08-21 22:21:48 Oil takes longer to dry can really only be used on canvas and stock paper but it’s easier to blend. Acrylic works on most surfaces but  you have to work faster with it because it does dry fast. Acrylic is easier to work with if you’re new to tube paint
787 2018-08-21 22:21:45 A person can plead guilty to something he or she did not do, and the prosecution will accept the plea, especially a plea that keeps the #WitchHunt going.
788 2018-08-21 22:21:43 India has huge energy demands, imports 70% of crude oil, don't know why canada isn't exploring this area of alliance when it has huge reserves to meet these demands....

792 2018-08-21 22:20:48 Yung pa change oil need ko 
793 2018-08-21 22:20:45 Alberta borrows because it can't manage their programs efficiently. Alberta spends more on programs per capita than Quebec and yet manage to tax less. When you are too reliant on oil royalties that's what happens. Oil that Fed gov has subisidized from the 70s.
794 2018-08-21 22:20:38 Similar with oil painting and figure drawing.... particularly with nude model.
795 2018-08-21 22:20:12 Not at all. I had researched oils awhile ago, and actually forgot I had it.  Thought I'd try it before any CBD oil. So far, it's pretty good. (I'm hoping it helps me sleep!)

798 2018-08-21 22:20:08 Are you just as outraged about Chris Watts killing his wife and kids? He dump their bodies in oil drums, good white guy right? Legal or illegal people kill, In the USA Americans are killing Americans but keep the microscope on your agenda topic.

I took the whip in for an oil change, ended up needing some more expensive work. I aint even flinch & even cracked a smile when i heard the ticket.
801 2018-08-21 22:19:57 Captain Ahab and the rest of the crew are still waiting for Trump to make New Bedford great again!  Whale oil is maybe the  only thing worst than coal!  I am amazed Trump isn’t trying to revive whaling!
802 2018-08-21 22:19:38 I could care less what he says, it's what he's doing that scares me. 

Rolling back environmental protection regulations - among other crap. 
His obsession with oil and coal. All about $$$$$ to him and this disgusting party in power

With little results. I gave up and then I found this. 10 years to late? I say better late than never.
807 2018-08-21 22:19:03 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
808 2018-08-21 22:18:49 if Alberta doesn't supply oil, USA, Russia, Venezuela will. 

They are not likely ( =will not) invest in renewables with that money.

814 2018-08-21 22:18:31 Whale Oil was once 80% of America’s GDP ... almost everyone living here relied on whaling to fed their families.  Just imagine the money +jobs, jobs, jobs if @realDonaldTrump made whaling great again.
815 2018-08-21 22:18:29 If it Partially Hydrogenated or Fully Hydrogentated and or similar industrially processed > Coconut extract aka Oil. There is heaps to be sceptical and worried about!
816 2018-08-21 22:18:29 The declaration has been made, ignore at your own peril. One thing is sure when juju dey find blood, if you give am palm oil, e no go take.

822 2018-08-21 22:17:39 Tuna steaks but, a John west in oil is also tremendous.
823 2018-08-21 22:17:19 My hair produces so much oil it’s disgusting 
824 2018-08-21 22:17:19 That'll just give him another reason to want to go to war with the middle east for more oil
825 2018-08-21 22:17:14 blocking the pipeline barely even changes the amount of oil that Alberta produces, but as a large effect on the amount of royalties paid to the province, and amount of carbon tax collected. These monies are used on renewable investments.
826 2018-08-21 22:17:12 As you serious? I’ve been paying $200 for oil changes because I thought it would void the warranty. Wtf!! No one told me this.
827 2018-08-21 22:17:08 Ive watched it too! Hell ya but they’re right about oil

829 2018-08-21 22:16:59 I'm looking for essential oil carrier bottles...do I have to order them on amazon or can I find them at hobby lobby or Michael's? Where are my oily friends?
830 2018-08-21 22:16:56 It is vitally important to the arms manufacturers and the oil companies but doesn’t do much fir veterans, military personnel, or the American people - it benefits corruption in the GOP.
831 2018-08-21 22:16:49 Devacurl is so amazing but it’s soooo pricey. I use a deep conditioner by Marc Anthony and then i use the Jamaican black castor oil leave in by she’s moisture and I’ve been good so far
832 2018-08-21 22:16:44 Awwwww i think its the ‘rich arab princes and princesses’ stereotype,,, and also the fact that those countries are resourceful as you said with oil etc. It might also be bc of the rich image that touristic areas advertise
833 2018-08-21 22:16:27 I wonder how much baby oil he’s gonna put on for the game
834 2018-08-21 22:16:16 So if an oil company retires older employees in order to promote or employ younger folks like yourself you would not accept the offer because of honor or respect for a fellow professional, maybe if one of your mentors happened to be one of the affected?
835 2018-08-21 22:16:14 Maybe your security detail shouldn't have attacked American citizens in DC? Maybe you shouldn't have smuggled oil out of Syria? Maybe you shouldn't have denied the Armenian genocide? Erdogan, you are not welcome here!

846 2018-08-21 22:15:15 why do koreans have this mindset that we arabs are so rich  i've watched a video where a guy asked korean what comes to your mind when you think of arabs and all of them said 'they're rich, they have oil etc..'

848 2018-08-21 22:15:13 My roommate used all of my olive oil without buying more 
849 2018-08-21 22:15:12 I see Jeggit poured oil on troubled waters 
850 2018-08-21 22:15:07 Just watch as all the Conservatives go out of their way to defend the oil worker who killed his wife and strangled his young daughters and put their bodies in oil tanks. Is he one of your MAGAs, too? Sick.

852 2018-08-21 22:14:51 Mom gets the one cooked in olive oil and has sea salt on it. It’s the lightest. They’ve flavored kinds too.

854 2018-08-21 22:14:48 Arksually I had to go up to confirm the "my mom" part at some point just to be sure oil from sallah ram wasn't affecting my eyes already. Well, arkusally I think ..... honestly I dont know what to think. This is way bigger than things I think about abeg.

858 2018-08-21 22:14:45 @billmckibben #fracking We have a technology that makes it possible to get rid of produced water from oil drilling. We turn the water into distilled water, which is always a good thing. The oil companies will like this, because they will make more money. Outlaw injection wells.
859 2018-08-21 22:14:39 That’s right. I am in the oil business, I do drive a foreign luxury vehicle, I own a tuxedo, I smoke Cuban cigars, and I can drink a Martini. I can also identify a guy like you who tweets foolishness. Run along now. #cdnpoli

861 2018-08-21 22:14:22 As Newsnight showed tonight Venezuela's economic problems are entirely to do with its dependency on oil exports and the oil price crash. Are you aware that Venezuela had hyper inflation in the past too under a right winger? That was just before Chavez!
862 2018-08-21 22:14:13 making the assumption that blocking the pipeline reduces the amount of oil consumes, is false. The world has more oil than will ever be demanded, 'Peak Oil' used to mean peak supply but now means peak demand.

So what's up for grabs is who supplies it
863 2018-08-21 22:14:05 does anyone else ever remember Megaman: Powered Up and wonder why Oil Man was the way that he was?
864 2018-08-21 22:13:58 My mom said she want to try some experimental stuff so she asked if she could sauteed my shrimp in the giardinera pepper oil.....WHYYYY?? Ever since she found out how much my insurance policy is, I believe she really tryna take me out.
865 2018-08-21 22:13:58 Dunno; but would guess if TPTB weren’t worried about it, they wouldn’t be attempting to sanction 2 of the biggest oil producers in the world out of global markets as we speak.
866 2018-08-21 22:13:55 Using coconut oil on one's hair or taking an oil bath in it sounds lovely and luxurious. I've never trusted it as a food due to the high saturated fat content, but if butter can be rehabilitated, maybe coconut oil will be too.
867 2018-08-21 22:13:41 Let me tell you how to make the best roasted Roma tomatoes: balsamic vinegar, garlic and olive oil. Then throw those babies in the oven n watch em roast

872 2018-08-21 22:12:47 Damn CBD Oil is expensive.! Bought a little bottle of it yesterday for $65.!
873 2018-08-21 22:12:38 That's why it gets any kind of popular support in the 1st place. Nazis were on cusp of subjugating entire European continent, along with its riches. Hitler dreamed of reaching oil of the middle east & coal of the Ural, which never would have solely Germany's via liberal democracy

875 2018-08-21 22:12:32 taking a shower at your gf's: lush shampoo with sea salt to exfoliate your scalp, moisturizing body wash that smells like sweet delicious mango, in shower body conditioner infused with rose oil,  etc

taking a shower at your bf's: has to use body wash as shampoo
876 2018-08-21 22:12:14 Only to be superseded by the arrest of John David Stutts. I believe the entire series of sketches was sponsored by a fictional oil company. If broadcast today, the fictional sponsor would be forced to pull by social media backlash
877 2018-08-21 22:12:10 If you really want to go to town then put some oil in a pan fry up about 10 clothes and some cinnamon stick out 1 cm try that for some time about 5 minutes then add the rice fry that for about 2 minutes then add the double amount of water

902 2018-08-21 22:09:22 I never understand why there is a fuel cycle. The price of a barrel doesnt have a weekly cycle. Also oil is under $75/barrel. Yet our prices for fuel are extremely high
903 2018-08-21 22:09:20 usually I also use kiehl’s midnight recovery cleansing oil as a makeup remover/precleanse

907 2018-08-21 22:08:55 My kid is happy with homemade sautéed chicken, basmati white rice, and a side salad with lemon and olive oil, every single day. I offer her other foods but she loves her classic lunch. Always ready for her when she gets off the bus. 
908 2018-08-21 22:08:53 Whoopie. Let me guess what your crowd has in store for them. 

I bet you're going to treat the West Virginia MAGAts to the Donald Trump Rally Special. 

 • Spoon-fed Lies
 • Donny's Special Snake Oil
 • Trumpy Kool-Aid
 • Lots of Red Meat
 • Delivered in a Gaslit atmosphere
909 2018-08-21 22:08:46 sure.  I realize that you can't weigh the GDP against things like number of days Orcas push their dead babies around the Salish sea or air quality or number of natives put in the hospital while illegally plowing an oil line through their land.
910 2018-08-21 22:08:35 Alaskans own 13,523 shares of DELEK US HOLDINGS INC, worth $328,203. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in UNITED STATES.

916 2018-08-21 22:08:15 Of course, Ogaden is largely dependent on z other states in many ways. But, z oil case is a total disgrace, it gives locals & z country nothing as per z recent interview of z former PM. It divided among China, TPLF in form of consultancies firms and ABiy illey. SO bad!

918 2018-08-21 22:08:05 Where's your outrage at the man in Colorado who killed his two daughters, stuffed them into oil containers, buried his wife in a shallow grave?  It's a dog whistle for the Trumpers to show their outrage.  Why are we not concentrating on expired Visas?
919 2018-08-21 22:08:01 I love my Cold Press Coconut oil.. No one will tell me otherwise.. Been using it since over 3 years ago n I’m still very much alive.
920 2018-08-21 22:07:31 Good luck getting M7 to listen to you. He thinks Uganda is his personal fief where he decides who has rights and who doesn't. Which's why he talks of, "my oil", "my roads", "my money", etc. Uganda is Museveni; Museveni is Uganda. @HEBobiwine or his rebelious kind aren't welcome.
921 2018-08-21 22:07:27 Will it make your oil more accessible? If so, the American government would be more than happy to send a few friendly drones over to correct your government
922 2018-08-21 22:07:25 This nonsense they sell you in Greece that you would become Venezuela if you had the drachma must be stopped. Complete and utter nonsense. 
There is no dictatorship in Greece nor you are heavily depended on oil prices. Για όνομα ...
923 2018-08-21 22:07:10 Remember, the groups financing the fake #climatechange reports saying it's not due to burning fossil fuels is the same industry that vehemently argued to keep lead, LEAD in gasoline. 

If you support big oil's take on climate change, go eat some lead. Big oil says it's A.O.K.

930 2018-08-21 22:06:04 one. you’re never ugly so hush and two. try a clay or tea tree oil mask
931 2018-08-21 22:06:00 I can sort of understand that, but as hard as the big picture is for people in that field to see, we do need solar, when you consider that  big oil holds no allegiance to the US, it is no surprise that I pay 3.60 a gal  even tho we export more than we use now
932 2018-08-21 22:05:45 We can turn produced water oil wells into distilled water, using solar energy. Retweet to help change the law, outlaw injection wells. Change oil wells into enhancement, rather than an environmental positive.
933 2018-08-21 22:05:44 White dude kills pregnant wife and two daughters and stuffs them in oil pipes. Oh...wait...He's a citizen.
934 2018-08-21 22:05:41 Out siders move to Co and know nothing about the burial grounds of our indians, seem to be normal families, and this happens. This man needs an excercist not a hanging. The lack of oxygen and toxins in oil gas. Living aboveSavage spirits can create insanity and demonds can atach
935 2018-08-21 22:05:29 gunna see what this whole essential oil thing is about...
936 2018-08-21 22:05:09 I'm completely ignorant of all this stuff, so I'm curious why a Kurdish oil company shipping oil to Israel would desire to conceal that fact. Honest question.
937 2018-08-21 22:05:06 Plantations (like for Palm oil) and fertilizer runoff (like for soybeans) decimate the environment as well. There is no ethical consumption in capitalism, be it veganism or some other consumption based ideology.

945 2018-08-21 22:04:03 I went to Walmart to get an oil change and they did something wrong
946 2018-08-21 22:04:02 @ggatehouse @EvanHD @BBCNewsnight Venezuelan ‘mismanagement’ only three sources: oil, oil, oil. It has been going on for decades. Other presidents just created more poor. Really poor. Then of course US always helps with foreign policy sanctions like with Turkey.
947 2018-08-21 22:03:59 We'll get back though through international agreement. In order to claim our share of assets, may be that Scot negotiates those fields to pay off our debts right away (I know it's all UK/London sewers etc) so we start with a clean sheet. We have LOADS of oil fields - no biggie.
948 2018-08-21 22:03:55 Can you point me to your wholly justified outrage at the white American citizen who killed his family and dumped his kids' bodies in oil tanks? I can't seem to find it on your timeline. Or are you only pissed when illegals commit heinous acts of murder?
949 2018-08-21 22:03:51 Thank you for asking! That is a great question! Yes, I keep this at room temperature on purpose and do not decarb it intentionally therefore I can give this powerful oil to elderly people and children who are not used to the psychoactive effects of high amounts of thc..

962 2018-08-21 22:02:34 hearing a lot of high praise for snake oil
963 2018-08-21 22:02:27 Sweden and Norway* also have lower per capita CO2 emissions than China, and Finland and Denmark are getting there.

* Oil exports excluded.
964 2018-08-21 22:02:20 Of course they are...mind you that upstanding American in Colorado dumped his murdered babies in an oil tank.
965 2018-08-21 22:02:13 And all the Trumpsters are jumping on it.  But were they jumping on the white father who killed his wife and stuffed his two little girls in oil barrels earlier this month?  Guess those deaths are bad enough.

973 2018-08-21 22:01:32 I do use coconut oil quite often!  However it's a pain in the but as it gets EVERYWHERE and on everything =)  Still I love it.
974 2018-08-21 22:01:29 Or they can soak it all with the oil they bought from so called Syrian Rebels aka youknowwho and light it up

987 2018-08-21 22:00:18 Camping FOTD: Avoid ticks by dropping 40 drops of tea tree oil with 12-16 oz of water and spray it on. So simple and very effective! Even if you don't run into any ticks, at least you'll smell great.

995 2018-08-21 21:59:31 -For spots & pimples use tea tree oil or a regular spot treatment so it'll go down much quicker & leave it on overnight

1009 2018-08-21 21:57:59 I’ve suddenly seen a lot of class action lawsuits against #RoundUp. I would like to sue the sun, because I used to lay out for hours slathered in oil. I have a really good case, the sun is a KNOWN carcinogen and RoundUp is only a probable carcinogen.
1010 2018-08-21 21:57:55 I disagree, he cares about Muslims and he lied through his teeth continuouslyx if you like your dr. you can keep your dr. An extra 2500 per years in savings. He also tried to kill the coal and oil industry with his regulations.  There is nothing good about Barry as a human being.
1011 2018-08-21 21:57:35 of course when i go get an oil change, everything wrong with my car  i need a new air filter, cabin filter, 4 new tired & something idek flushed lmao

1016 2018-08-21 21:56:39 Protect oil companies? Where do you think your relative prosperity came from? Clue: The same source that is wanted desperately by the third world, who want cheap energy to lift themselves out of abject poverty. Not green bollocks dictated by ignorant 1st world hypocrites.
Grow up
1017 2018-08-21 21:56:36 was gonna ask if you meant -currency or -graphy, but then realised it doesn't matter cos in either case if you're paying for it, it's almost certainly snake oil.
1018 2018-08-21 21:56:15 I'm partial to a little butter in my mix too or a light olive oil, but my sourdough is pure starter, a mix of flours, salt and water. I use a splash of oil in a pizza dough, butter in a rich multi-seed wholemeal. Palm oil just wouldn't be invited to the party!
1019 2018-08-21 21:56:01 Oil will be a primary energy source for 100s of years. Good thing too because we need energy to live until the next phase is ready. That phase will unleash 1000,000 times more energy.
1020 2018-08-21 21:55:57 There is obviously a competition between the European powers ,and Canada,to attract the oil rich investment potential of the oil princes .Do you see the similarity between France ,England Germany and Canada.Oil and investment...that is the agenda .#Islam
1021 2018-08-21 21:55:52 Space heating is going to be a real bear in the Northeast.  We’ve still got so much fuel oil space heating here!  More people are switching to heat pumps, but the really low temp situations we get are a damper on conversions.
1022 2018-08-21 21:55:51 Stop using dirty, filthy oil and gas! It’s destroying our planet. This has been a stupid idea and must be phased out immediately. Stop building lines & infrastructure for it.Time to save our planet and create jobs. Renewables are the way we need to go.

Change at top, change in government, increase in oil prices, change in overall sentiment.

You realize  how much money you are missing out on staying invested in this garbage ?

One day it will turn yes, but that day is not near
1026 2018-08-21 21:55:07 Tbh the only thing I do is use a prescription face wash and moisturize. I don’t use foundation tho, just some press powder and coconut oil to remove my eye/brow makeup.

1031 2018-08-21 21:54:16 Organise a food festival every weekend so farmers can sell out. Ban every Nigerian from owning more than one land or house until every Nigerian owns a property.rebrand Nigerian police to be like oil company workers.make every indigenous product almost tax free &govt used.
1032 2018-08-21 21:54:16 Where's your outrage at the guy in Colorado that killed his young daughters - stuffed them in oil containers and killed his wife and buried in her a shallow grave? Either you care about all lives lost or you're nothing but a fear mongering racist.
1033 2018-08-21 21:54:10 Who is the snake oil salesman??
1034 2018-08-21 21:54:07 And the Dad who stuffed his daughters into oil barrels earlier this month??  White. American. Legal.
1035 2018-08-21 21:54:00 True enough but this is an emergency as serious as a war. The economic wellbeing of the oil patch will need to be slowly wound up.
1036 2018-08-21 21:53:36 A lot of commenters are unhappy with the renewable energy “scam”/subsidies whatever, but are perfectly happy to continue with $13BILLION in oil and coal subsidies and screw the added public health costs..  (ABS for data).  Got it.
1037 2018-08-21 21:53:25 Newfoundland has offshore oil which is more a threat to environment than a pipeline would ever be, but not a damn word about that.

1040 2018-08-21 21:52:25 The guy at @Valvoline gave me an extra discount on my oil change, really made my day 
1041 2018-08-21 21:52:21 Don't be stupid and blame it on the immigrants. Shannan Watts and her two children were killed by her husband and dumped in an oil field. Every minute womens are killed by their american citizen husbands.
1042 2018-08-21 21:52:16 If US refineries increase their capacity to process sweet and light crude, and if the refined products based on that crude have more commercial value then Crude import will reduce by some margin. 20 mbd contains NGLs too. Not just crude oil.
1043 2018-08-21 21:52:13 May be Islamic Republic of Iran  coming to negotiation table, when tightening crude oil exports

1051 2018-08-21 21:51:21 Yes, driven by there for decades and only last year or two did I start noticing the oil smell. that whole stretch of real estate along the river is a total waste.
1052 2018-08-21 21:51:09 yup, we all know oil is the future! totally.
1053 2018-08-21 21:51:08 I remember ....

Devaluation (1967)
Oil crisis (1973 - 74)
3 day week (1974) - (exciting, we had to light the house with candles!)
Sugar running out (1974)
Stagflation (pretty much all the time I was growing up)
IRA bomb threats (very frequent in the '70's)
IMF bailout (1976).
1054 2018-08-21 21:51:01 Wrong. Germany uses Solar power more than the US as does other countries , as we are gas, oil and still coal. Fossil fuels and big profits are hurting our beautiful land.
1055 2018-08-21 21:50:44 I need to get back on it, although I could never get used to BPC. Oil in coffee...seemed blasphemous to me.
1056 2018-08-21 21:50:28 I don't see a place for palm oil in bread full stop and I won't buy any product containing it. Your other bread e.g. Warburton's implies that it is a traditional British baker, so is palm oil a traditional ingredient in UK bread? It's all about money, smoke and mirrors!
1057 2018-08-21 21:50:03 Bit of coconut oil and butter, sauté onion first, add veg and seasonings. Then cooked meat if having. Push to side of wok, mop cooking juices with kitchen roll, add two beaten eggs, to side of wok, cook down then incorporate all. Roll onto plate. The food, not you 
1058 2018-08-21 21:49:56 I’m thinking of trying oil paints. Should I use:

1063 2018-08-21 21:49:10 For people like me, I am under greater free speech attack now, I have no collectors able to afford a 200 dollar oil painting, but 12 years ago, my sketches were selling for 700-1200. So this is a false claim, the downtrodden are in a worse state today, I cannot afford food or apt
1064 2018-08-21 21:49:07 DO's :
apply hair mask or coconut oil weekly
use more conditioner than shampoo
drink more water

1065 2018-08-21 21:49:06 Molly who was a border collie/st Bernard molted twice a year. Nora just constantly drops hair. Apparently coconut oil in their food helps
1066 2018-08-21 21:48:56 i've never been able to notice a huge difference between cooking oil flavors, and also it's the preparation (vinegar)

1068 2018-08-21 21:48:36 Wat is that castor oil
1069 2018-08-21 21:48:28 We should be talking more about defunding oil/coal industries and using that money to run a fleet of electric cars to replace both buses and private car ownership. Like Uber but run and financed by gov so it's accessible to (or free for) low income peeps
1070 2018-08-21 21:48:24 Is the bar chart even accurate, though? If memory serves, that solar number is direct + indirect jobs, whereas the others are only direct. Texas oil & gas numbers alone (direct + indirect) are larger than what's listed there.
1071 2018-08-21 21:48:13 I just want to bake something but I can’t get the top to the coconut oil off!
1072 2018-08-21 21:48:10 Hugs! The very same to you beloved. Keep extra oil (being prayed up) on you, so when you're running for the Lord & distractions of life try to catch you off guard you can reach WITHIN, gird thyself up & be READY for the invitation when it shows up Matt.25:1-13.Stay wise in Jesus.
1073 2018-08-21 21:48:08 Buying American steel & aluminum is VERY important to Americans having quality, well paying jobs.

1078 2018-08-21 21:47:56 How fast Trump destroy the earth. He must owe his oil buddies many favors
1079 2018-08-21 21:47:49 Agreed, but a lot of people have devoted there lives to providing for their families using oil money, it’s difficult to convince them that there actions are contributing to a problematic future, not the city dweller who walk or bike to their jobs.
1080 2018-08-21 21:47:42 Have you been tweeting with outrage about the white Texas guy who killed his wife, and dumped his two daughters in a barrel of oil? No. Because you are a fear monger who thrives on racism. This murderer’s status is a non-issue. Violence is the issue
1081 2018-08-21 21:47:40 #Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world. It is this  American corporates want. They are aided by the usual suspects. Take #Iraq or was about oil nothing else & 1000s died up to 2007 as Shia majority refused to hand over the oil fields to private oil companies.
1082 2018-08-21 21:47:39 Woo congrats - I bet Big Oil & Gas are shaking in their boots now! (And their collaborators)
1083 2018-08-21 21:47:32 As for the costs of asylum seekers, they have to be borne if Canada is to stay a beacon of democracy and a positive player, as we’ve always been. Heck, I’d rather have my $ billions in oil subsidies back. But it’s always the childish fake issues with the right these days. Sad.
1084 2018-08-21 21:47:29 D dullest person in Nigeria knows Buhari doesn't donate money like them. Hence they turned his antagonist's. They turned public property to personal asset after getting donation frm each state Governor's, Give Oil blocks to Girlfriends, Private staff on Govt payroll.. Gluttons!!
1085 2018-08-21 21:47:29 Dude, good thing you are in West Virginia.  You might be able to pull some wool over a few of their eyes and sell a few more bottles of snake oil. Regarding the Manafort and Cohen thing, you must be peeing yourself. Damn, how do you pardon someone for tax evasion?  WTF.
1086 2018-08-21 21:47:20 Exactly.
1087 2018-08-21 21:47:13 Er, great to hear #Newsnight taking the side of the poor, downtrodden oil executives re: Venezuelan economic crisis currently, eh?
1088 2018-08-21 21:47:06 Cooking oil weed you goofy get a grip lame
1089 2018-08-21 21:47:00 WTO is pro-globalism/neoliberalism, which is environment averse.
There is nothing environmentally sound about burning tons of oil shipping apples, socks, toothbrushes and workers around the planet to save a buck.
1090 2018-08-21 21:46:59 some of them do have legit medical uses, most .... are really good for scents- especially if you are allergic or reactive to artificial scents.  (i get migraines form a lot of the artificial ones)

1103 2018-08-21 21:45:28 No, Alex Jones got banned for violating Twitter, Facebook and YouTube’s rules on promoting violence upon “the enemy”. Alex Jones is nothing more than a snake oil salesman who makes tons of money off of fools

1108 2018-08-21 21:45:06 Well I'm happy! Got my oil analysis back and my head gasket isn't blown! The high potassium levels were likely due to the water pump leaking internally, putting coolant into the timing chain cover.

1110 2018-08-21 21:44:54 I did break my moms oil house she got from Switzerland. It was not my two year old brother.......

1112 2018-08-21 21:44:41 I'm still figuring out a skin routine but for the past month it's been: some rapid clear cleanser from Neutrogena that feels like paint because I bought the wrong thing, either naturals acne foaming scrub or oil free acne wash daily scrub both from Neu, then anti blemish pads --

1114 2018-08-21 21:44:27 A woman wearing all white just heavily brushed up on me when she tried to get by. PSA lady - i wear banana boat oil ALL SUMMER (and never wear white) - this was your mistake. “Just rub some salt on it, it’ll come out.”
1115 2018-08-21 21:44:16 They already took some oil and gas fields by moving the sea boundary without any parliamentary scrutiny and just before the Scottish Parliament was reconvened. Sleekit Blair and Brown.

1118 2018-08-21 21:43:51 WE HAVE THE SUN SHINING ON US OFFERING FREE FUEL. WHY WOULD WE PUT OUR WEATHER & WATER IN HARM'S WAY TO MAKE A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE GET RICH ON FILTHY OIL? YOU WON'T BE HAPPY UNTIL YOU FRACK OUT THE LAST TEASPOON OF FILTHY TAR SANDS OIL.  YOU CAN'T DRINK OIL. SHAME ON YOUR GREED!
1119 2018-08-21 21:43:49 Akeem gotta be Exxon mobil looking for more oil deh lol
1120 2018-08-21 21:43:45 If there was a hell we would all burn but I wonder if some would burn worse than others. For example, the man who murders his pregnant wife and two daughters and dumps their bodies in an oil vat. Just thinking out loud here. The news has really gotten to me today.
1121 2018-08-21 21:43:43 Written by Dr Azeem Ibrahim, who thinks Scotland with it's multiple revenue streams, Oil Gas, Food & Drink and so much more can't afford Indy BUT India USA & Pakistan ... No problem

1125 2018-08-21 21:43:14 Moral judgements getting so complicated these days: on the one hand side, there is Global Warming, toxic oil spills, high emissions and Dieselgate

On the other side, @elonmusk tweeted „funding secured“
1126 2018-08-21 21:43:04 Husband admitted strangling his "pregant" wife claiming wife killed daughters. HE put them all in his truck & drove to oil work site where he buried wifes body & dumped the girls inside" oil tanks, according to court document so his motive was stated.  I didnt make one up.
1127 2018-08-21 21:42:54 Wonder if Fox noisemaker Dagan thinks the poor children and wife murdered in Colorado and submerged in motor oil suffered any less bc their suspected killer was A WHITE CITIZEN. Dumbass southern simp.
@dagenmcdowell

1133 2018-08-21 21:41:40 But how much is Venezuelan hyperinflation due to economic mismanagement and how much to US economic warfare, keen to win control of huge oil reserves from a socialist govt? #Newsnight
1134 2018-08-21 21:41:34 Our oil age will not end through lack of it, but by fighting over what’s left.
1135 2018-08-21 21:41:19 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
1136 2018-08-21 21:41:19 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

1146 2018-08-21 21:40:20 back in first year we only got to see him in "The End of Oil." if memory serves (and it may not) he suggested that in the post-oil reality he imagines, he'd like to work as an editor for a local newspaper

which struck me as an implausibly rosy view of the post-oil age but sure
1147 2018-08-21 21:40:18 every day the President opens his mouth, a sad wolf wants to become politician

1153 2018-08-21 21:39:42 Ok Ms Limited View. Nikola Tesla had his funding pulled by JP Morgan. His research challenged the oil paradigm. Tesla's hope/plan was for clean free energy for all of us. Big oil won the war for capital and gave us our current toxic, expensive energy paradigm.

1156 2018-08-21 21:39:34 Is the hair situation related to any of the recent oil spills of the past few years?
1157 2018-08-21 21:39:19 So I'm going to start bulking up for a few months, I already have creatine, protein, omega-3 fish oil, spirulina, and BCAA supplements to help with recovery and performance. If anyone has any tips I'm open for advice

1160 2018-08-21 21:39:01 I beg to differ. The oil-for-food scandal damaged the UN's credibility, perhaps permanently.
1161 2018-08-21 21:38:56 fuck castor oil, we out here putting straight bacon grease in our hair
1162 2018-08-21 21:38:46 How can a govt earned $393bn oil revenue in the spate of 4yrs with nothing to show for it, and a govt that earned $94bn in just 3yrs with numerous infrastructural projects in all geopolitical zones of the country. Now, you want us to go back to the era of mismanagement/impunity.
1163 2018-08-21 21:38:44 Stock market highest Ever!! Unemployment lowest EVER!! Two million less people on food stamps!! India is now buying our oil instead of Irans. Not much!
1164 2018-08-21 21:38:42 This is interesting. So the old deal expires and if Trump does not come to office there is cheap oil in gold terms. Why is Trump so important? What dies he offer? Any speculation?
1165 2018-08-21 21:38:19 My oil bar that I bought cost me little money
1166 2018-08-21 21:38:14 Just saw an article about “coconut oil is pure poison” don’t wanna read it tho some one do the work for me. Cause twitter gone be mad.
1167 2018-08-21 21:38:01 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts walnut oil with 1 part grapefruit juice and 1 part miso. Add thyme and agave to taste.
1168 2018-08-21 21:37:59 I did! I have to work on the ZX Spectrum entry for Chaos Constructions first, plus I'm doing Luke's course already, but I'll squeeze this in somehow as well? Plus I'm doing oil paintings this two weeks. Yeah, this will be great!
1169 2018-08-21 21:37:58 My oil bar smells so nice
1170 2018-08-21 21:37:44 I’m so excited about my oil bar

1172 2018-08-21 21:37:39 Right if someone hurts your kid and you kill them you then call 911 and try to resuscitate your kids. Not bury the wife and throw the babies in oil. He’s SICK!
1173 2018-08-21 21:37:33 What followers?
1174 2018-08-21 21:37:32 I bought an oil bar
1175 2018-08-21 21:37:27 In rare circumstances it is necessary.  Abortion should not be on demand. I would hate to return to the days when women relied on backyard abortions. Killing Yemeni children with American made bombs is murder. Too many Middle Eastern people have died because of greed for oil.
1176 2018-08-21 21:37:25 Without oil every Canadian would be dead in less than 2 months.
1177 2018-08-21 21:37:21 I can feel the oil drilling

1181 2018-08-21 21:36:54 You have to press it for aaaages then marinate it then fry it in a wee bit of oil at a really high heat. Or marinate it and barbecue it. Basically marinade is your friend.
1182 2018-08-21 21:36:53 It seems u know nothing about Venezuela and his history
They are failing because

1185 2018-08-21 21:36:21 New Brunswick 5 top sources for imported crude oil in 2015: Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Angola, United States, Norway. 1 daily import from Saudi = 1 daily production of mid-sized producer Penn West Exploration Ltd. Climate change over human rights!
1186 2018-08-21 21:36:15 Bathe in olive oil to become the most extra virgin.
1187 2018-08-21 21:36:04 be back in some form (specified emitters). Methane? The gov't says that methane impact is 25 times greater than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. Mostly from Alberta’s oil and gas sector (70%). New standards led by the Alberta Energy Regulator and Climate Change Office. OK..
1188 2018-08-21 21:35:54 maybe it's because of oil in his fur or something that's how waterfowl do it.
1189 2018-08-21 21:35:50 No mention of oil scandal? Hmm bias much @mpr
1190 2018-08-21 21:35:45 and throw in a lot of oil
1191 2018-08-21 21:35:44 Canada ranks 17th on the UN Sustainable Development Index. I’d like to hear your argument about why it is more ethical to source crude oil from countries ranking 100th and worse on the list, as we do now, instead of from Canada.
1192 2018-08-21 21:35:33 Okay so there’s a patient at my job that has a mean y.i/uti idk what they think she has but they’ve literally been giving this lady everything & pills & creams & I tell the nurse why don’t y’all rub coconut oil on her. It’s anti bacterial, antifungal....

Love your turkey patties
1202 2018-08-21 21:33:42 Every dollar invested in fossil infrastructure locks in decades of use.  Unless that happens with really substantial emissions reductions (NG instead of fuel oil for space heating) it takes us further away from decarbonization goals.

1206 2018-08-21 21:32:40 I find turmeric and coconut oil face masks helps. And drinking as much turmeric tea as in humanly possible. Something could be inflamed and it works for me.
1207 2018-08-21 21:32:35 Lastly look at "Africa"the Continent,Africa was created by "big cooperates" cz they saw lucrative product that are not found anywhere else but Africa "the mineral resources, oil" etc but today Africa is being destroyed by "Politicians" who are poor,hungry,never been in control b4
1208 2018-08-21 21:32:10 Have you tried a coconut oil hair mask? I color my hair and do one about one a month and it makes a HUGE difference.

1238 2018-08-21 21:28:51 Oh, I would burn the skin off those peppers and throw them and the cucumbers in some vinegar, oil, salt, pepper, and onions and let them sit for a day or two and become a delicious sandwich or side dish!

1241 2018-08-21 21:28:35 Yes. Get a good oil strain though
1242 2018-08-21 21:28:27 California Garden is the brand you tend to see - they have a recipe for pretty much every MENA country (400 million people can’t be wrong!), but if you just add oil, lemon juice and some of your preferred herbs/spices to a can of our whole fava in water you’ve got great ful 
1243 2018-08-21 21:28:14 Yes get a personal sized blender —- combinations of olive oil / citrus / fresh herbs like cilantro or parsley / bit of honey if you like sweetness —— can also do tahini / garlic / lemon vibe

1245 2018-08-21 21:28:06 Nothing sinister, looks like a standard seismic survey, looking for oil and/or gas.
1246 2018-08-21 21:28:03 Hi writer friends. I have been off twitter, and working on Oil Apoc 5. I wrote 31000 words in nine days. No day under 3K. I know the characters so well, it was easy. Also, no Twitter = no distractions.

I'm angry at Twitter but I miss my writer Tweeps!
1247 2018-08-21 21:28:03 apple cider vinegar and tea tree oil i heard helps
1248 2018-08-21 21:28:03 The more oil on top, the more natural your peanut butter is.
1249 2018-08-21 21:27:57 War on coal? You mean the war on wealthy oil corporations, old money, and the advancement of new technology, clean air, and jobs.
1250 2018-08-21 21:27:35 I was definitely having close contractions when I did the castor oil but at the time they didn’t know I couldn’t/wouldn’t dilate so they just sent me home after they monitored and checked me several times. There’s an herbal tea you can drink too!
1251 2018-08-21 21:27:25 A wonderful, fertile, oil rich country  wrecked by extreme socialism #Venezuela
1252 2018-08-21 21:27:21 Real story is
-Few Arab traitors,
- canada support them in order to control saudi oil sources in the name of human right.
- the project failed.
1253 2018-08-21 21:27:16 Pif investment in #tesla was it a game by the #Saudi #pif fund to lure #ElonMusk in w/ small investment n then backtrack? Its logical considering their bread n butter is oil.

Oil and in black
1255 2018-08-21 21:27:15 That #TinderGames woman had her competition portion all wrong. Now if it was me:
1. Patch drywall
2. Paint a wall without making a mess
3. Fix a leaky faucet 
4. Change the oil in my car & tire
5. Make a dish where pasta isn't the ONLY ingredient
6. Squat 140 lbs +
1256 2018-08-21 21:27:11 “What kind of oil??” Idk the one that makes the car go help
1257 2018-08-21 21:27:09 I’ll be burning the midnight oil
1258 2018-08-21 21:26:58 Hahaha, bros did not use coconut or ube, he had to go for boiled egg and bread. Add drops of palm oil and you have a sacrifice right there.
1259 2018-08-21 21:26:52 By changing global oil economics?

You sir truly are magical

the TC CEO is lying.
1260 2018-08-21 21:26:50 Oil costs money. Give him a hot bath.
1261 2018-08-21 21:26:36 Why are turning a healthy food into an unhealthy one. Cooking it un olive oil and pouring gravy. Leave the fruit alone.
1262 2018-08-21 21:26:33 And dumping his two daughters in filled oil tanks to boot.
1263 2018-08-21 21:26:33 Coconut Oil on the lashes & Hair and a hot steam shower. I feel like a new woman.
1264 2018-08-21 21:26:31 Not to worry the liberals will find another country to buy dirty unethical oil from.
1265 2018-08-21 21:26:11 Doc — how to choose supplements for Vit. C, D, Magnesium, Fish oil, that do not contain oils or sugar? Any recommended brands? Thanks!
1266 2018-08-21 21:25:57 I was young, dumb and full of extra virgin olive oil.  Now I'm yung, in perpetual existential crisis and got dipped in sauce
1267 2018-08-21 21:25:51 Boil the SOB slooooooowly in oil.
1268 2018-08-21 21:25:33 I did the castor oil and it DEFINITELY did something. But it’s AWFFFFUUUL and you need to be careful about how much you use and how often you do it. But squats and lots of walking works, so does the sex
1269 2018-08-21 21:25:24 That photo resembles more like an oil spill than any "Red Tide" I remember seeing as a kid long ago. Look at the oily sheen produced on top of the Lake O brown water
1270 2018-08-21 21:25:21 Need to make so carb free bread    Bought #coconut, #linseed and #almond flours. Will have a go tomorrow   #keto #ketodiet #ketolife #carbfree #bread any good #recipes?   I just added eggs, oil and baking powder.  Keep in fridge - it lasts a week. Love it with #marmite
1271 2018-08-21 21:25:20 Look at the castrol oil bottles in between the pumps. And Adolph in the road!!
1272 2018-08-21 21:25:01 Puck magazine was some quality anti-monopoly trolling. In 1888, they wrote Standard Oil is "a corporation famed for owning things that belong to somebody else.”
1273 2018-08-21 21:24:51 Wow I bought two of those trash mags today bc i hate waiting for an oil change. And Chris Hemsworth is like in them 5 times.
1274 2018-08-21 21:24:50 Ojo!! Fue tomado permanentemente por Mapuches, Painemiles, cobraban para dejar entrar y salir camiones Ojo!!! Cobran regalías El que fuera el 2 yacimiento de gas en el mundo, megareservorio de gas, está agotado Como son varias las empresas y se explota oil/gas siguen cobrando
1275 2018-08-21 21:24:50 Bama is so bearish tech and so bullish metals. Good thing I’m long QQQ and the minute oil short stops working I’ll be moving it to gold short. Would love to see gold get to 1211 first though
1276 2018-08-21 21:24:49 ANOTHER TRUMP RALLY 

His delivery cadence has the timing of a comedian
the flair of a carnival barker & the substance of a snake oil salesman.

The disillusioned & uneducated will listen wide eyed with rictus smiles & clenched fists to self-gratuitous hype & outright lies.
1277 2018-08-21 21:24:43 Squatters! Accent to limps ! Won’t pass rights to any outlaws in violations of immigration law! Medicare healthcare bills owed to rights to drive legally in an America Americans automobile! Crust over oil prices electricity belong! Free is free! Outlaws not to profit for crimes®©
1278 2018-08-21 21:24:39 The pilgrimage (Hajj & Umrah) industry is Saudi Arabia's second most important after Oil & Gas.  Hajj & Umrah (which can be performed at any time of the year) add an estimated $12 billion a year to Saudi's GDP.
1279 2018-08-21 21:24:24 he flew in as I was serving up :( Don't know whether the hot oil killed it, or the intense flavour of my slow cooked garlic chicken
1280 2018-08-21 21:24:23 My town, or a consortium puts out a yellow pages.  Used it today, although not often. I got an oil change this morning.  Big day for big oil.
1281 2018-08-21 21:24:20 I’m like can you just change my oil and keep the talking to a minimum pls because I have no idea if you’re telling the truth

1284 2018-08-21 21:23:28 Although I would never actually consume coconut oil, it's unsurpassed as a skin moisturizer.
1285 2018-08-21 21:23:04 I LIVE IN CALIFORNIA DRINK CBD OIL BY THE GALLON ORDER WEED FROM AN APP TALK ASTROLOGY BUT IM HAPPIER THAN I WAS ON THE EAST COAST SO IM GONNA KEEP DRINKING THIS KOOL AID FOREVER FIGHT ME
1286 2018-08-21 21:23:04  i was like what is that body butter? Coconut oil?
1287 2018-08-21 21:22:57 Considering the details of both stories only broke today I don't know how you can say that.  Both are terrible.  The former should be drowned in the oil he set his daughters.   The latter, life in prison in the country he came from.
1288 2018-08-21 21:22:40 The creepiest canola oil in Waterloo Station
1289 2018-08-21 21:22:38 Nothing like having an older car and KNOWING u can’t just go for an oil change in peace! I didn’t come here for all this!
1290 2018-08-21 21:22:15 So Washington just gave the into big oil and coal to decide themselves how to protect the public on emission and pollution!
Stupid is, is stupid does! And it’s the Republicans!!!!! Trumps dragging them all into the swamp with him! Way to protect public health
1291 2018-08-21 21:22:06 if coconut oil is so bad for us they should make it illegal like cannabis
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
\\\\\\\\\\\
1292 2018-08-21 21:21:56 Oil prices will go back to $100 a barrel.  Just before the next Middle East war gets going.  And these same countries will want to be friends with Venezuela again.
1293 2018-08-21 21:21:43 Mayonnaise, plain natural yogurt (the best), coconut oil is antifungal in case its fungal, apple cider vinegar in water (google quantities) any oil in case you have a dry scalp, hydrate, if nothing helps check with a doc before you lose all your hair.
1294 2018-08-21 21:21:43 Venezuela isn't a socialist country, in terms of a constitution being bound to Marxism. It also has a majority of privately owned companies, driven by the capitalist market. The biggest difference is government owned companies, like oil, which was used for social programs.
1295 2018-08-21 21:21:39 What about the poisoning and killings?
1296 2018-08-21 21:21:30 the ppl that post under your tweet about the car oil
1297 2018-08-21 21:21:15 Folks love to give you their play by play moves lol. “Just got my oil changed, I was almost over 3k miles and I can’t do my car like that”
1298 2018-08-21 21:21:11 パレードは難しいみたいだけどそういうのしてもいいと思うのよね。まぁ秋田県民祭りっこ好きだからなんかしらやりそう。
1299 2018-08-21 21:21:09 Yo. I almost died. I literally put my rob on, the oven glove and if I could I cover my whole face. I hate hot oil lmao
1300 2018-08-21 21:20:56 The story is not over on oil, years of underinvestment in exploration is eventually going to come home to roost. Took profits on GDDY above $80. I count that as a win.
1301 2018-08-21 21:20:46 Look up kaneh bosm in bible....it's a holy oil
1302 2018-08-21 21:20:15 No. Coal is carbon, not oil & rocks. If you cleaned the coal, you would be left with nothing.
1303 2018-08-21 21:20:03 Could be from Fessy’s olive oil coated body.
1304 2018-08-21 21:19:43 VITAMIN E OIL!!!!!
1305 2018-08-21 21:19:01 水(ウォーター)とは仲が悪いです。
1306 2018-08-21 21:19:00 Weigh in week 2. Lost a pound but actually feel it’s more. Happy with this as that’s on top of my fabulous weight loss last week. Finding it easy to stick to my #keto diet as I feel full all the time   Using #olive and #avocado #oil to up my fat intake #ketolife #ketodiet
1307 2018-08-21 21:18:48 A big reason why I don’t eat fried food at home. As much as I love it, I hate getting burn with flying oil. So I stick to baked meat lol
1308 2018-08-21 21:18:45 I use a mixture of 100% Tea Tree Oil, Peppermint Oil, Vitamin E Oil, Pure Organic Aloe, and Witch Hazel with Lavender. Works like a dream 
1309 2018-08-21 21:18:35 as an italian i strongly recommend you consume at least one glass of extra virgin olive oil daily
1310 2018-08-21 21:18:30 I couldn’t live without my Moroccan oil serum, it smooths my frizzy hair and helps my blow dry stay in a day longer, fab prize guys!
1311 2018-08-21 21:18:18 You know they will fuck that up to, frakking for oil, causing the Moon to crack and sending giant chunks hurtling down on our heads.
1312 2018-08-21 21:18:18 So she killed the kids and that made him dispose their bodies in oil?  Pull my left leg, it plays Jingle Bells
1313 2018-08-21 21:18:17 I have been following the case. No logical person would dump their precious children is crude oil after seeing them strangled. Bury the mom in a shallow grave. Then go on TV and beg for their safe return. He was having an affair. In CO we get minutes updates. We want him dead.
1314 2018-08-21 21:18:09 Crazy Bernie, wants to blame America while it has the most stringent epa laws in the world. While down in San Diego CA, Mexico still burns tires and motor oil that make its way into the USA. Sad how Bernie doesn't have a word with the President of Mexico!
1315 2018-08-21 21:17:54 Because oil, dude. Because oil, and rightly so - oil is a vitally needed strategic resource.
1316 2018-08-21 21:17:53 But there is no global warming. Bring back the coal and make oil cheaper and cars bigger.
1317 2018-08-21 21:17:51 Acrylic is made from a plastic base. Oil is bade from an oil base. Neither will come out of your clothes.
1318 2018-08-21 21:17:48 How can being clean, be bad for you...? 
   As for the oil problem...your skin breathes, and oil clogs your pores. 
   
   There's smoke in the air from wild fires here in the Pacific NW, and being out in it, I can FEEL it on my skin. Showering daily is a MUST!
1319 2018-08-21 21:17:44 Free Palestine free Syria. No more blood for oil
1320 2018-08-21 21:17:43 *oil
1321 2018-08-21 21:17:31 Their oil is expensive to refine
1322 2018-08-21 21:17:26 Just made a peanutbutter sammich. I was going to wash it down with a glass of milk and it tasted like catfish oil!!!
And I'm never buying milk or juice there ever again! They sold me biege orange juice once.
1323 2018-08-21 21:17:25 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
1324 2018-08-21 21:17:25 Donald Trump is not about the people & he is not for the people! Donald Trump wants us to believe that he has no ties to Vladimir Putin & Russian oligarchs! But the evidence will show otherwise as Robert Mueller continues to build a case against this snake oil demagogue!
1325 2018-08-21 21:17:14 Why does Iran sell oil to a country (China) which has incarcerated one million Muslims?
1326 2018-08-21 21:17:07 Saturated fats are also found in a few vegetable oils, such as palm oil, coconut oil, hydrogenated oils, and chocolate. #Heart #Health
1327 2018-08-21 21:17:05 Not for human consumption, no. So that begs the question - where is this contaminated meat going? To feed farmed salmon? Ground into fertilizer? Fish oil products?

1332 2018-08-21 21:16:14 yeeeugh... hold on.

[ he’s digging through his mom’s bags she’d left in his room for safekeeping... after a few minutes in and out of the bags he’s back with a comb, leave-in-conditioner, and hair oil. ]

[ cracks his knuckles: ] alright! let’s git to work.
1333 2018-08-21 21:16:11 But I guess, @Saintgab4 would gladly enlist in another US adventure in Middle East & go die in some bloody desert there, so the big Oil companies stays on top.

1334 2018-08-21 21:15:46 Is coconut oil healthier if you mix it with rendered bacon fat?
1335 2018-08-21 21:15:30 Coal and oil are not clean, nor are they renewable. Stop selling America and Americans out to you oil and coal donors!
1336 2018-08-21 21:15:27 my sister uses the cbd oil from the health store downstairs in blanch across from ebs and it's like €30 for a small bottle and €70 for the bigger one
1337 2018-08-21 21:15:20 I always thought my olive oil tasted extra-virginy 
1338 2018-08-21 21:15:15 Because that worked out so well for the oil field worker who killed his pregnant wife and two daughters?
1339 2018-08-21 21:15:07 Yemen has a strategic and vital location in the Arabian Peninsula.
It has mineral wealth & lakes oil.
SaudiCoalition want to control it but the Yemenis reject thisbecause it's occupation
so they fought against us & bombarded us with missiles trying to makes us surrender to them.
1340 2018-08-21 21:15:03 Have some freelancers willing to come in and burn the midnight oil...
1341 2018-08-21 21:15:03 Thank you ! For this I used Winsor and Newton Artisan Oil Colors 
1342 2018-08-21 21:15:01 Well @Laurensavage5 nearly lost her temper painting the trim of a primaris marines’ shoulder pads. 

Just got to knock over my Nuln Oil and she’s one of us.
1343 2018-08-21 21:14:58 Its what happens when u provide most of the world with its oil.
1344 2018-08-21 21:14:42 Now that I think about, maybe I should have worn gloves because the engine oil on my hands looks like it's here to stay 
1345 2018-08-21 21:14:19 Snake Oil Salesman
1346 2018-08-21 21:14:14 this shows how great our country is doing under our president.Oil prices have been going up and down for the last 2 weeks.We are more upset to learn a illegal killed the college student
1347 2018-08-21 21:14:07 Whilst this is true, it doesn’t excuse snake oil salesmen.
1348 2018-08-21 21:13:57 My 48 yr old brother lives at my parents home and has somehow convinced them that it’s not weed that they are smelling but pachouli oil and/or his cologneThe reason this pisses me off so much is because he’s supposed to be clean/sober while living in their home#impissed
1349 2018-08-21 21:13:56 NO BITING! Oil is more '70s than us.
1350 2018-08-21 21:13:55 I bought myself panda and forgot to grab a freakin fork so it’s just been sitting next to me while I wait to get my oil changed and I’m so sad :/
1351 2018-08-21 21:13:40 I know car salesmen are just doing their job, but if I’m simply waiting on a oil change & tire rotation.. you think I’m tryna leave with a whole new car?! 
1352 2018-08-21 21:13:39 Puntlanders demand the government to kick Oromo out of Bosasso and all of Puntland create citizen database before they steal our oil and resources #Puntland #Somalia
1353 2018-08-21 21:13:32 My heart pressure is a bit tippity top high..willing to pay more for a more realistic reading..Ps been swallowing cod liver oil !
1354 2018-08-21 21:13:29 Thanks for letting us know, Thad. While this shouldn't require stirring, sometimes oil separation can happen over time if stored in a warm place during transportation or before reaching store shelves. We'll share this with our team. So we can help further, shoot us a DM!
1355 2018-08-21 21:13:28 We took folks there for a retreat about this time last year. Food was always lukewarm, power was bad (we spent our last night there in darkness), horrible. Only bright spot was the abundance of coconut water + the cheap coconut oil I bought. I will hopefully never go there again.
1356 2018-08-21 21:13:28 Coconut Oil could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot someone without losing the support of its backers.
1357 2018-08-21 21:13:11 Poi intendiamoci le privatizzazioni non sono la panacea di tutti i Mali anzi. Solo in Norvegia stat oil garantisce ricchezza ai propri cittadini.. Ma credo solo perché il petrolio è proprio tanto tanto

1368 2018-08-21 21:11:52 Thank you for doing this story!  I am a licensed customs broker and know how badly this is already killing our economy. I don’t think people realize how bad this is going to be. Reminds me of the 73 oil embargo.  It’s sickening when I think about it.
1369 2018-08-21 21:11:50 You and I, we're like oil and water
1370 2018-08-21 21:11:45 Exactly. Half of our GDP goes towards the military/industrial complex but you will never here anyone in the #GOP or indeed, many Democrats either, say we need to trim military spending. Or stop propping up oil & coal or agrabusiness with huge tax giveaways.
1371 2018-08-21 21:11:41 Everyone screaming, “Build the wall” completely forgetting about the nice looking, middle class, “legal”, white guy who just strangled his pregnant wife and babies and dumped them in crude oil.
1372 2018-08-21 21:11:40 Rinsing with a few drops of tea tree oil in water seemed to help for me, but I can’t recommend it (nor do I do it any more) as it’s apparently carcinogenic (and tastes vile). Get some Corsodyl and avoid stress and sugar.
1373 2018-08-21 21:11:35 We need 20 cc of olive oil stat
1374 2018-08-21 21:11:31 It’s an art installation based on an Egyptian tomb. It’s made out of oil barrels.
1375 2018-08-21 21:11:19 What's amazing is that they don't even understand the sociopolitical system they quietly try to advance.

Hey have ZERO experience with it, and struggle to discredit their critics who have.

This should tell you something about the snake oil they're peddling.
1376 2018-08-21 21:11:08 It is all to save the birds you know...  pay no attention to the oil and coal dollars lining his pocket, as SD markets lose dollars on their renewable resources
1377 2018-08-21 21:11:08 Awarra Court Area is one of the oil producing communities in the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria but remains the most impoverished community in the region. No electricity, no road, no hospital and no school

1378 2018-08-21 21:10:58 Yes I saw he was spouting his opinion on @TheRebelTV a while back... he was interviewed by Ezra himself...

(I think that's about all you need to know about Mr King the scientist... oh, plus he works for a company that cleans up oil spills...)
1379 2018-08-21 21:10:42 He,he possibly. Our non-conformist hair is the source of much morning amusement and evening out irritation. She has taken to spreading coconut oil on it, so now she smells of Bounty.
1380 2018-08-21 21:10:29 Did you even see the cash flow increase at that time and the oil bonds that MMS raked up hiding 1.42 lakh crore expenditure, Madam such a great economic genius we had to get that nonsensical 10.4%, India paid a heavy price for this stupidity

1382 2018-08-21 21:10:15 Moms want @JerryBrownGov to walk the talk & stop issuing permits for new oil & gas drilling! It's time to leave fossils in the past & commit to a swift & just transition to 100% clean energy. Our kids need bold action now. What are we waiting for? #BrownLastChance #StepUp2018
1383 2018-08-21 21:10:13 RT @LivingSafely: General Mills #Bugles this August? Its top four ingredients are corn meal, coconut oil, sugar and salt.
1384 2018-08-21 21:10:06 still experimenting bc idk what i’m doing, but: wash my face at night in the shower w cetaphil, spot treat acne w drying lotion, then put on the watermelon glow sleeping mask. in the morning i wash again and then use cetaphil oil control moisturizer (which has spf bless)

1386 2018-08-21 21:10:05 Absolutely #PRIM #UKOG the whole Weald Basin including #ANGS will have a storming end to the year - so much factual evidence provided by on site Twitter guys - substantial positions held x6 shares - only the shorters worried at this stage as news could drop anytime #oil #simple
1387 2018-08-21 21:09:54 I stick with CBD oil but some days beg for a heavy OG.
1388 2018-08-21 21:09:48 I thought serverless would be async software that runs on sneakernets... alas it was snake oil from people looking to rent you overpriced compute time :(
1389 2018-08-21 21:09:42 White wine, olive oil garlic all the above and a fat knob of nduja, tagliatelli, and it's a yes from me
1390 2018-08-21 21:09:35 Just devoured a full on chicken bibimbob meal on #singaporeairlines with red pepper paste and  sesame oil. They should just open a restaurant in the US with little express meals like this. #singapore #airlines #showtheresthowitshouldbedone #singaporeairlines
1391 2018-08-21 21:09:17 I still have PTSD from the time hot oil poured on my leg while frying plantain.
1392 2018-08-21 21:08:59 ¿Que pasa Mexico? Part 2
For many years and up until 2015, the main source of foreign income in Mexico was oil exports. 
Guess what exceeded oil in 2015? The money being sent back to Mexico by Mexicans living in the USA.
1393 2018-08-21 21:08:20 curious si yanni, pano daw kung naubusan na ng oil ang mundo

nag respond agad si alex ng “kumuha ka nalang sa mukha mo.”

promise nakakahiya sa taxi driver, medyo napabuga ko yung iniinom ko 
1394 2018-08-21 21:08:18 Certainly oil around the coasts.
1395 2018-08-21 21:08:10 I love the coast but it is polluted by sewage being dumped constantly, why would drilling for oil be any worse? At least we would be free from foreign dependency and just think you would be saving those countries eco-systems.
1396 2018-08-21 21:07:57 Venezuela is a pretty good example of what happens when you systematically mismanage finances, permit rampant corruption and nepotism to take root in the party, and generally make a mess of things.

Their economy is tanking because they didn't plan for oil prices to drop.
1397 2018-08-21 21:07:41 Things my toddler has thrown a fit about today: I wouldn't give him a knife, I chose the wrong banana, I wouldn't let him drink olive oil, I opened his yogurt, oh and we can't swing 24x7. The kicker, he's only 17mn old. #lifewithboys #toddlerprobs #toddletow #help #Tisone
1398 2018-08-21 21:07:29 Before Boris Johnson as Mayor. Before the illegal war in Iraq. Before meddling in the Middle East to steal oil.
1399 2018-08-21 21:07:28 Countries economic strategies 

Norway: let’s invest our oil billions in a state managed fund to provide long after the oil is gone. 

U.K: The gold price look decent to you? Aye? Let’s sell all of ours then!
1400 2018-08-21 21:07:27 We had a 96 Sentra with a manual. In 225k miles the only think we changed was normal oil changes, brake pads, battery, and alternator. Those engines are pretty bulletproof.
1401 2018-08-21 21:07:15 Omg pls don’t put coconut oil on your face  as an esthetician this is like my nightmare
1402 2018-08-21 21:07:14 Hacked until I was a sesame seed but they couldn't get the oil

1404 2018-08-21 21:06:58 I hereby move that when we find#AdamCatzavelos one of the things we must do to him is serve him eggs fried with catsor oil. Or kanjaani maqabane?
1405 2018-08-21 21:06:58 Mixed up my CBD oil with my THC oil. This is going to be an interesting engineering meetup
1406 2018-08-21 21:06:45 .@JerryBrownGov, pointing a finger at Trump’s coal problem, completely ignores his own oil problem. Over 20,000 new oil and gas wells under Jerry’s tenure, in some of the most disproportionately and economically impacted communities across CA. #BrownsLastChance
1407 2018-08-21 21:06:38 Oil and vinegar ma'am ? Wtf. Pull up your pants this is subway!
1408 2018-08-21 21:06:35 Waiting at car dealership for an oil change. Trying really hard to finally read Schickler’s Racial Realignment, but the multiple “8 counts” dumpster fires broadcast on the lobby TV is proving difficult to ignore.

1412 2018-08-21 21:05:25 I picked this up from a Redditor:

Roses are red

Oil prices have risen

Cohen plead guilty

Trumps going to prison
1413 2018-08-21 21:05:21 It would accelerate legacy automakers R&D, marketing, and bolster an already record-pace for renewable energy.  Utility companies would rejoice and lobby to convert.  Getting off foreign gas & oil to a combination of domestic production, paired with renewables.
1414 2018-08-21 21:05:06 I love being overcharged for an oil change 
1415 2018-08-21 21:05:03 Bring back the whaling industry! Whale oil makes great candles. Make America Candlelit Again!
1416 2018-08-21 21:05:01 2/2 Furthermore fossil fuels are not the main driver of #climatechange (it's solar variation) and oil products need not stink or be poisonous if/when they are processed properly. On a net basis petroleum and coal products have been massively beneficial to human population growth.
1417 2018-08-21 21:04:53 It's normal just add 3/4 a quart of oil the book is wrong
1418 2018-08-21 21:04:45 We Caribbean black folks use it as skin oil. That’s what I use it for. Are you pro CBD oil??
1419 2018-08-21 21:04:45 Obama's climate rule also created far more jobs than it destroyed at the same time making it easier for us to breath, reduce cancer, reduce dependence on foreign oil, and save our land, water and air from being polluted.
1420 2018-08-21 21:04:45 But, he did what everyone, fans & press said to do. Spend money. Buy players. Be it Arsenal/Man U/Leeds. Be it QPR. Spend money. And if you don't you are letting everyone down. OR. Maybe ownership of clubs by Oil Barons and resource thieves has messed up our thinking. Could be...
1421 2018-08-21 21:04:40 this free oil change came in clutch  .
1422 2018-08-21 21:04:31 My buddy went to high school with Brock and they’re literally cut from the same cloth. Only difference is Brock hits baseballs and my bud has two kids and works in north Denver for an oil and gas company. So bro.
1423 2018-08-21 21:04:28 currently getting the oil changed on my car and while i've been waiting for only 30 mins, on the TV here i've heard about a body being found, 4 murders, and 2 deadly crashes....like wtf y'all

1430 2018-08-21 21:03:47 And by the way, the price have oil has been going up.  This means Venezuela would have been able to repair equipment and do capital projects for oil exports. This would have helped the economy  But they cannot because they have no access to their own cash because of the sanctions
1431 2018-08-21 21:03:38 y'all oughta realize that capitalism's ending is gonna be just as painful as its ascent

the entire structure of industrial life is unsustainable and we're rapidly running out of everything we need to keep it running. Phosphates, oil, rare earth metals, even fresh water and land
1432 2018-08-21 21:03:35 Went to delta sonic for an oil change didn’t pay 80 bucks #boom
1433 2018-08-21 21:02:53 Canola and sunflower oils are terrible and they are recommending those. Smh. Sunflowers collect a bunch of toxins. Canola is largely GMO. Coconut oil is what was used until these industrial oils were marketed. Looks like propaganda to me. jmo
1434 2018-08-21 21:02:37 I’m getting too good at making sandwiches. Never again will I settle for mayonnaise and mustard. I’ve moved on to pesto, oil & wine vinegar, fresh mozzarella, roasted red peppers, the finer things.
1435 2018-08-21 21:02:28 Trump will be winding up his people and telling them to go home and oil up and fully load their weapons and then plan where to place their control points on the streets
1436 2018-08-21 21:02:24 Did You Know Scotvian Geese contain Oil?
1437 2018-08-21 21:02:13 Well the marijuana has become legal in several states in the U.S. As for cigarettes that's an addiction and that tax is taking advantage of that situation. The oil industry won't let a high gas tax happen because of how much money they make off the sell of oil and gas.

1444 2018-08-21 21:01:22 Dad in history they talked about @tesla and how people bought all the stock to protect it from the shorts, because it was too important for the planet to move away from oil. Yes I bought stock, exciting times!
1445 2018-08-21 21:01:15 Iraq oil exports reached 3.5 mn barrels a day which helped several governorates rebuild infrastructure and reactivate economy.Local insurance income remain however untruelly low.Only explanation Iraqi business is still being placed  abroad with Iraq Regulator showing no concern
1446 2018-08-21 21:00:59 They don't if you don't do the maintenance. You've still have to change the oil, rotate the tires, put gas in the car, and do the other regular maintenance. That's not telling it what to do.

1454 2018-08-21 21:00:10 2 fish kills in Iowa in just 28 days. What are we doing to prevent more fungicide spills, more hog lot manure spills, more train conductors from driving oil tankers through flooded floodplains? Stop defunding the DNR, protect our rivers and streams!!

1457 2018-08-21 20:59:24 the best acting i have ever done is every time i get my oil changed and they bring the oil stick to me to see if its correct and i nod like "yes oh yes i know exactly what you mean it looks great" when i know nothing

1460 2018-08-21 20:58:45 Lol just like oil was going straight higher from $75 and $GDDY was going straight to $81. I will stock with my charts.

(Kudos, to the make up artists)
1462 2018-08-21 20:58:37 If you pour out the oil or just leave a bit in it, you save like 400 calories.  If you set the jar upside down before you open it, the oil will move to the bottom making it easier to stir
1463 2018-08-21 20:58:33 Dear friking Odessa midland area. STOP JACKING UP THE PRICES OF EVERYTHING JUST BECAUSE THE OIL INDUSTRY IS BOOMING. I refuse to pay 3.37 for some damn gas and 14 dollars for a fucking bag of jerky.

1470 2018-08-21 20:57:02 A pipeline would give you billions without environmental damage.  Why not get energy easy?  Think of the jobs.  Oil won't last forever. If you miss this go around on oil you may not get another chance.  Get jobs for your people.  Do something!

1476 2018-08-21 20:56:24 Well. Saudi Arabia is not an "ally" they just sell the majority of their Oil to the US. It's a relation of convenience. Simply put the US is addicted to Saudi Oil.

1478 2018-08-21 20:56:14 Or it can an irritant for other reasons. I was looking at diffusers at a store &, talking to an employee, found out they once tried to diffuse lavender oil in store as a demo and an employee with a sensitivity to lavender got so bad that they had to turn it off and send her home.

1485 2018-08-21 20:55:32 Lavender oil is Very relaxing btw.
1486 2018-08-21 20:54:59 Ah yes @MadocLeonard & how observant of you to spot that difference. In truth I see that the watercolour sketch is dated 1929 but the oil was exhibited in December 1930 so maybe Elwin worked it up during the winter of 1929/30. He also had a penchant for "bare" trees in his work.
1487 2018-08-21 20:54:56 If you’re really integrated with the market in question, sure. But that’s temporary. And there’s also the rest of the planet. The US buys Greek olive oil. The price would have plummeted immediately if they had their own currency.
1488 2018-08-21 20:54:40 I’m bout to buy hella oil paint and go ham !
1489 2018-08-21 20:54:35 I don’t think you realize what I’m saying. When Nitrogen made a train of oil tankers or vans, they would all look different.
1490 2018-08-21 20:54:34 Having just watched @algore's most recent documentary on climate change it further highlights what a danger @realDonaldTrump is. Putting his rich friends & coal/oil workers ahead of America & the World's health is truly disgusting, irresponsible & says everything about the man.
1491 2018-08-21 20:54:33 Coconut oil is pure poison
1492 2018-08-21 20:54:30 The US plans for a space force is not a plan for progression, its for survival. Their investors, big oil, is aware of climate change, and are looking to colonize elsewhere after their ill practice leads to the Earths demise.
1493 2018-08-21 20:54:12 Someone explain to me why Windows developers/IT and command line scripts are like water and oil. Holy dog.

1501 2018-08-21 20:52:35 What about the Canadian Liberal Government who continues to sell Military equipment to the Saudis while also buying their Oil. All the while deriding the Saudi Government for Human right abuses. If that isn't hypocrisy I don't know what is.
1502 2018-08-21 20:52:24 Veterans are constantly posing for baroque oil paintings and shedding single patriotic tears as they stand astride their children named "freedom" and "moderation" saluting the flag
1503 2018-08-21 20:52:20 I just sent our CBD oil suppositories and a tincture to my father in law in TN who has prostate cancer. I'm really hoping he will take it even though suppositories aren't the easiest to administer. Do you know what form of CBD oil he was taking?
1504 2018-08-21 20:52:08 Let us hope most of the Traitor Trump cabinet joins him!  Donnie Jr might want to buy lots of coconut oil he will need it!@DonaldJTrumpJr
1505 2018-08-21 20:51:55 Warm ¼ cup of honey and add ¼ cup olive oil. Stir well to combine. Apply to your hair where you want the highlights and leave on for 30-60 minutes. About 5 minutes before you wash it out, work it into all of your hair, focusing on ends. Wash out well
1506 2018-08-21 20:51:41 Thanks - the engine cover is usually fastened up but need to top up with hydraulic oil!

1508 2018-08-21 20:51:36 Angola has an oil-for-infrastructure deal with China, and it has yielded more results than foreign aid ordinarily would. I wonder if Nigeria has something like that.
1509 2018-08-21 20:51:35 I just hope the chemicals from the oil tanks won't hamper any of the forensic evidence on their bodies.
1510 2018-08-21 20:51:34 Only news I saw was a crude draw.  Means that if oil spikes and it drives inflation and that is enough to panic stocks, they aren't as cozy as the price they print.
1511 2018-08-21 20:51:33 @MattFontana83 peppermint oil is a good pesticide bugs hate it
1512 2018-08-21 20:51:33 What I still don't get is this. What exactly do you want him to do? He should share the right with other producers, or return the exclusive right? There are always best mining sources for diff materials. Same applies in oil and gas sector. And someone will be always b d lucky guy
1513 2018-08-21 20:51:03 Or read the story? You’re wrong buddy. Might want to read up on this. This asshole was having an affair, his all three bodies at his oil well workplace. Man completely destroyed family.
1514 2018-08-21 20:50:59 Poured eucalyptus oil onto the sauna heater and currently breathing good
1515 2018-08-21 20:50:48 3yrs of @OfficialAPCNg with low oil prices of 24$ per barrel is better when compared 16yrs of @OfficialPDPNig
1516 2018-08-21 20:50:46 Looks like lava lamp oil and tongue rolls
1517 2018-08-21 20:50:28 i think #cannabis oil is better and safer
1518 2018-08-21 20:50:23 Hardly politically convenient at the time. Christians were martyred for their beliefs. Boiled in oil, crucified and burned at the stake. It's your prerogative to think the stories are preposterous even if allegorical. However, Jesus' teachings were not arrogant.
1519 2018-08-21 20:50:21 Cutting up hot dogs to put in ramen was my first attempt at ‘cooking.’ Never use the seasoning packet; toss it all with olive oil, black pepper, cayenne, chives and a little Parmesan. You too can eat like a minor viscount for less than $.80/day
1520 2018-08-21 20:50:18 What's everyone's favorite companies to purchase CBD oil, lotions, and bath bombs from?
1521 2018-08-21 20:50:10 rosehip oil tbh. adding oil to my face has made it significantly less oily
1522 2018-08-21 20:50:06 I bought an oil change bundle from advance auto parts thinking that they change the oil too 
1523 2018-08-21 20:49:46 I think your point is (somewhat) sound. Restricting the tar sands does not lower Canadian fuel usage; and that is an important goal. The tar sands are incredible carbon intensive to extract though so it is oil we should avoid.
1524 2018-08-21 20:49:36 Matrix but they use oil and squids are predator drones
1525 2018-08-21 20:49:28 Tea Tree Oil helps 
1526 2018-08-21 20:49:22 Put some oil in their pockets and we Americans will come and "liberate" you
1527 2018-08-21 20:49:22 I know jumbie when I see it... nah! Grab the oil in the name of jesus!!
1528 2018-08-21 20:49:21 My doc just recommended I try CBD oil instead of the meds he prescribed me

Wow an ally
1529 2018-08-21 20:49:16 僕を酸化させたらダメだよ。オイルにとって酸化は命取り。…僕を見守っててね⁇
1530 2018-08-21 20:49:13 He's funnier and makes more sense than your fearless leader Trump.
1531 2018-08-21 20:49:08 Thanks hun x I’ve been sprinkling lemon juice in the doorways and scattering orange peel...  G looking at me like  If I can get to shops I’ll look for citronella, also eucalyptus oil.
1532 2018-08-21 20:49:04 I have epilepsy, sometimes the traditional meds don't work, that's the case for %10 of people. It's perfectly legal to treat epilepsy with CBD oil or other Cannabis products as long as you have a prescription. Doing the best for your child shouldn't be a crime.
1533 2018-08-21 20:48:59 You got 200million from oil last year . You received 13,000 million pounds from Barnett . Do your sum's
1534 2018-08-21 20:48:59 Agreed and data files on Horizontal Hydraulic Fracturing, Earthquake correlations, Fukushima liability, exxon oil drilling, sex trafficking, pizza fraud showing the global elites are responsible will be released...Time for accountability @tictoc  Love and Peace Bruthas and Sistas
1535 2018-08-21 20:48:47 Cannabis oil will reduce seizures.
1536 2018-08-21 20:48:40 And you sit at your little desk. Watch lights flash green and red. Buy ETFs, some oil stocks and 37,591 shares of $TSLA and think you're God's gift b/c some crappy TV show puts you on the air for a few minutes. Enjoy your 15 minutes. Looser (h/t @BagholderQuotes )
1537 2018-08-21 20:48:34 Very nice picture Ken.......
1538 2018-08-21 20:48:16 my semester consists of intermediate sculpture, oil painting & heat techniques w fabric.

y'all i've never been this hype for school wtf.
1539 2018-08-21 20:48:12 Hot oil just popped and burned my eye. This is my karma for telling Vinnie to name her fish caminah or normila
1540 2018-08-21 20:48:06 New Mexico Republican Governor Candidate Calls For Oil Traffic Toll Roads.
The AP (8/20) reports that New Mexico Republican candidate for governor “Steve Pearce is calling for a system of toll roads in southeastern New Mexico to serve booming oilfield and other commercial traffic
1541 2018-08-21 20:48:05 So u dont watch Trump or Fox news then, right?
1542 2018-08-21 20:48:03 Good that what parameters will use let @MBuhari finish his 8yrs then you can compare & contrast then$29b is nothing compare with high oil price  of 120$ per barrel
1543 2018-08-21 20:47:50 I will support the Democratic nominee no matter who it is! We need to unite behind a candidate & take the fight to Donald Trump & the Republicans in the midterms all the way to 2020, failure is not an option & Trump must be defeated as he’s a dangerous snake oil demagogue!
1544 2018-08-21 20:47:21 fully agree on the point of the global hegemon. China already trades its oil with Iran in RMB. The question is whether Germany will really support what it takes at the EU level to achieve that.
1545 2018-08-21 20:47:11 Incidently, oil is a fantastic bonus - we could survive without it - could oil companies?
Short answer: No, long answer: Nope.
1546 2018-08-21 20:47:11 Hence the reason a daggone Tylenol is $23. It's more cost efficient to have medicare for all. Right now, those with insurance are paying for those without. The hospitals are going to get paid...one way or another.
1547 2018-08-21 20:46:59 Can not I imagine that oil prices can come down and why? Answer:
Saudi Arabia reduced its production
2. Renewed US-China talks
3 - Sanctions on Iran will reduce one million barrels
4. Russia reduces its exports to Europe due to domestic demand
5- Oil prices are very few
90$ ok
1548 2018-08-21 20:46:52 She’ll be right back to hating oil and pipelines the second she loses next election
1549 2018-08-21 20:46:50 The [white] man been "sticking" Blacks for over 200 years...funny how that group cant take what they dish.  Sad.
1550 2018-08-21 20:46:47 I say again it is on Scotland's shores 
If Westminster had not stolen it Scotland would have been able to sell the licences build the infrastructure 
Scotland did NOT get its share before we had a parliament  
It was the @theSNP who pushed that 
Our oil was stolen 4 wars etc
1551 2018-08-21 20:46:44 Yeah it’s pathetic really, the US and Israel and Europe “so called freedom” nations do nothing to help this young woman. All they care about is money, guns and oil.
1552 2018-08-21 20:46:38 Have a listen to the Midnight Oil song Beds are Burning.

The start of my Australian education great song/band hubby introduced me to, but brutal lyrics and history.
1553 2018-08-21 20:46:37 How much is the oil?
1554 2018-08-21 20:46:26 Oh wow ! You are definitely missing out on some of the finer points of winter. It can be fun, for example, getting into your car, if it's parked outside and not in a garage. You sit down. Seat won't move. Engine will start, if you use thin enough oil. Maybe some day you.....!
1555 2018-08-21 20:46:22 "Break it in pieces, and pour oil on it; it is a meal-offering." Leviticus 2:6
1556 2018-08-21 20:46:03 A finales del siglo XIX cuando Standard Oil dominaba el 90% del mercado, los precios del petróleo nunca habían estado tan bajos, y la eficiencia y productividad nunca había tenido un nivel tan alto.
Pero "los monopolios son malos!!" 
1557 2018-08-21 20:45:50 There's no decline for Kevin Hart, the only decline is in your judgement and morals with you defending a career criminal like Donald Trump.
1558 2018-08-21 20:45:46 Combine 1/3 cup daily bread with 4 tsps corn. Blend with Olive Oil. Slice into 1 inch pieces. Serve over kale.
1559 2018-08-21 20:45:39 It is a fact that 60% of @AsoRock weapon is America supply, @OfficialPDPNig is selling to us candidate who cannot relate with America either private official capacity, other nations who could supply have oil more than we have.Maybe @atiku needs to beg @MBuhari to stock weapons
1560 2018-08-21 20:45:39 Argan oil

Your EPA is a joke. Run by the oil and gas lobby.
1563 2018-08-21 20:45:28 For reals! Like oh..."I am so upset that she murdered our kids, let me now hide their little bodies in crude oil?!"
1564 2018-08-21 20:45:26 Of you mean appointing your cousin Juan Manuel as the nation’s Oil Minister because he used to change people’s motor oil at the local neighborhood mechanic shop ISN’T a good idea? 

Who knew?
1565 2018-08-21 20:45:23 Although if I want an extra tasty toasty I’ll throw some olive oil at it before grilling it on the George Forman.

1574 2018-08-21 20:44:10 who can give my baby an oil change?
1575 2018-08-21 20:44:06 because of motoring & oil lobby-groups. #Freedom etc
1576 2018-08-21 20:44:02 #Incognito Don’t blame Richie, this heat is getting to him...should be talking about how big oil is responsible for this outburst
1577 2018-08-21 20:44:01 You're glimpsing the not-too far flung future where all the earth's oil reserves have been exhausted.
1578 2018-08-21 20:43:59 RIP OIL SLICK :(
1579 2018-08-21 20:43:58 Even if it’s just a front for you to crowdfund your beard oil and indigo girl habits
1580 2018-08-21 20:43:54 Follow me for a rebuttal to oil and gas propaganda. 

*It’s all bull shit. Fossil fuel companies don’t care about the destruction of the planet, they only care about profits.
1581 2018-08-21 20:43:53 Essentially, yes. A lot of the jolt goes into your tire (feel the tire after a long drive, it’s warm). And part goes into the oil in your damper. There is some that probably goes into the metal spring as well.
1582 2018-08-21 20:43:51 My fave thing is when I pull them all out with olive oil and get an eye infection 
1583 2018-08-21 20:43:46 That's due to a lack of beard oil being utilized. It's just like any other hair, you must maintain it.
1584 2018-08-21 20:43:46 #Trump enough oil for how long, a week, two years? You think it is there forever? 
You should listen to your wife 
You should listen to science
1585 2018-08-21 20:43:41 Growing up, all I’ve learned is that coconut oil or baking soda can basically fix everything.
1586 2018-08-21 20:43:34 Karin Michels, professor of the depart epidemiology Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health,  recently during a lecture at the University of Freiburg, Germany, peddled by unqualified and self-appointed online health gurus—consuming coconut oil carries a raft of health risks.
1587 2018-08-21 20:43:29 The Crash Oil:
La crisis global de recursos y los problemas de sostenibilidad en los que está inmersa y a los que se verá abocada nuestra sociedad industrial, plantean la necesidad de un cambio de paradigma económico.
1588 2018-08-21 20:43:23 If you think of this though...whenever people go to the ER and cannot pay, because they have no insurance and the bill is too high...they HAVE to see them. They cannot just let them die or suffer. When those bills aren't paid, the hospital tag the insured with the bills.
1589 2018-08-21 20:43:15 If you haven't tried these...Ice pack on back of head with feet sitting in very hot tub water can sometimes release a vascular headache.  Orgasm can sometimes release headache.  Plenty of water after having a small amount of caffeinated coffee.  Peppermint oil diffuser & temples

1597 2018-08-21 20:42:13 Well, we actually agree. We don't need all of these decrepit old folks holding back the nation with old unevolved ideas. I think we need term limits. And those studies can be found online and from impartial reputable economic sources.
1598 2018-08-21 20:41:34 President Trump was in the Olive Oil business with Manafort's father but that was a long time ago. That's all.

Also this exact same tweet but replacing "Manafort" with "Cohen."
1599 2018-08-21 20:41:24 Is tea tree oil also good for super dry flaky skin sa face?
1600 2018-08-21 20:41:15 U must be joking, there's no oil anywhere in the Palestine region and in the ME oil wasn't unearthed during the making of Israel. How does oil in Iran or Saudi Arabia has anything to do with Israel is beyond me.
1601 2018-08-21 20:41:03 OUR GOVERNMENT GO TO WAR NOT FOR OUR FREEDOM BUT CORPORATION GREED KILLING INNOCENT PEOPLE INCLUDING WOMEN AND BABIES TAKING OTHER COUNTRIES LAND, GOLD , OIL , AND CAN’T FORGET THE POPPYSEED THAT WE CALLED HEROINE  IN OUR STREETS , SO PIGS HAVE A JOB ARRESTING OUR AMERICANS ,

1611 2018-08-21 20:40:08 Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face.
1612 2018-08-21 20:39:59 Did you know that oyster mushrooms have been shown to effectively remediate oil spills on soil?

They break down the chemical bonds and actually use the oil as a fuel source.

If there aren't any heavy metals also present you can actually eat the fruiting mushrooms!
1613 2018-08-21 20:39:54 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia are doing with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling Groundnut oil

1620 2018-08-21 20:39:01 Argan oil. Use sparingly. Use an old t-shirt to dry, don't rub with a towel. Maybe see a hairdresser to get it thinned. From fellow frizzy head
1621 2018-08-21 20:38:52 i was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna
1622 2018-08-21 20:38:51 Farage’s comeback tour won’t work the way it did the first time. This time the people know the facts and snake oil salesmen like him are always found out to be charlatans cheating those that worship them.

1628 2018-08-21 20:38:26 .@realDonaldTrump Question: .@potus you said we were going to stop the Syrian war and defeat ISIS. If you have defeated ISIS and you say you have-WHY are we still in Syria OCCUPYING 40% of the land & of course it just so happens to be the land that has OIL and/or water. Syria
1629 2018-08-21 20:38:26 It’s not a simple case of adopting Norway’s tax model,  as the difference in production costs would change things drastically. Also, I’m not sure how willing our current oil companies would be to hand over their developments to the state.

1647 2018-08-21 20:36:15 Are you happy that the Military takes so much of your money and you get nothing in return.  Are you happy Corporations get tax breaks? Do you think the oil companies need subsidies?You already live in a socialist country yet you get nothing for it.
1648 2018-08-21 20:36:04 It’s not someone else’s property, it’s my tax money also. & that of many others that would agree, not just me. The same argument you give me, is the same in reverse from our position. Why are you pointing the gun at us to carry on with oil, oil, oil, more oil, & then more oil,etc

1654 2018-08-21 20:35:05 All of that complexity doesn’t change the fact if US oil demand was 25 mbd and not 20 mbd, US would have to import more hydrocarbons and export less hydrocarbons. With all due respect, the mix is not the relevant distinction. It’s just muddy thinking.

It doesn't happen overnight because we continue to spend billions on subsidizing oil.

1764 2018-08-21 20:25:13 So tonight I’ve tried @sanctuaryspa relaxing bath oil to help me relax. It smells amazing and my skin feels really soft. Fingers crossed for a good nights sleep! (Some #meditation may also help!) #relax #WorkLifeBalance #littlethings
1765 2018-08-21 20:25:11 I swear by the tea tree oil face wash from trader joes. It's the only thing that's ever made my skin actually look/feel clean and healthy.
1766 2018-08-21 20:24:52 i'm not a lawyer but if your wife killed your two kids and you killed her in a retaliation rage why would you dump your kids' bodies in a fucking oil tank?
1767 2018-08-21 20:24:49 If olive oil comes from olives, where does baby oil come from?

1769 2018-08-21 20:24:39 Richie, I was hoping for some Midnight Oil!
1770 2018-08-21 20:24:23 @jiffylube Really? Get ur oil changed and ur tires rotated and get free chipped paint on all ur rims and then get total denial from the manager. "I don't see how we could have done that" says on-site manager. It's the lack of care for customers stuff you clown. Get a clue...
1771 2018-08-21 20:24:19 Tbh I just expect everything you do to fail. This tweet is absolute trash. I have another great idea, let’s find oil. I’ll provide a strong shovel and lots of encouragement to those willing to dig.
1772 2018-08-21 20:24:09 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
1773 2018-08-21 20:24:06 We need to shut down oil. Use Thorium Nuclear reactors to replace oil and gas.
1774 2018-08-21 20:24:04 Thank you for asking, I am trying very hard not to slide into purging and restricting right now... It's just so hard as a vegan sometimes because say a big bowl of no oil aubergine, potato and chickpea with smoked tofu fills me up and I know it's not so caloric...

You believe in:

1778 2018-08-21 20:23:32 Adopting Norway's tax model for NS oil (& the creation of a state-owned body) could see us benefit HUGELY from oil revenue - & also work with Norway to consolidate the sector, becoming a major energy provider for the north of Europe.
An undersea energy grid is also a possiblity.

1782 2018-08-21 20:23:05 The noble art of fact checking is pushing snake oil. If news need to be fact-checked, what guarantee do we have that they don't need to be?

Aren't the news factual?

Why are MSM treated differently?

Why don't the fact checkers tell us the fact about their own bias?

1798 2018-08-21 20:21:58 You don’t think oil and coal, a finite non renewable resource that pollutes the environment and is continually costlier to mine/extract isn’t going to be replaced by cheaper renewable energy?

1811 2018-08-21 20:20:28 KSA annually purchase 200 Billion$ weapons from US; plus GCC countries fullfill its 90% oil demand. Why will America speak against KSA, when it has massive economic benefits from it. US only interfere in those countries where its personal interest is in danger.
1812 2018-08-21 20:20:25 Wow. The trolls are out in force today. I’ve never gotten so many personal insults. Feels like a campaign...? I had FOUR on one tweet. Really feels like they’re passing names around.

1817 2018-08-21 20:19:21 I never attacked CO2. Nor nuclear. We just can’t lose sight of costs to control & contain nuclear along with waste issues. With oil & gas, even if abundant & cheap, stop wasting it. With this aside, let’s welcome the relatively new kids on the block with proper investment funding
1818 2018-08-21 20:19:11 A great company idea. You can pay someone to take your car to get an oil change and then bring It back to your house. I literally despise waiting in the car dealership for my car!!!!
1819 2018-08-21 20:19:11 The loss of Greyhound isn't a big deal for people like me, or those in the oil patch. It's going to disproportionately hurt the poorest and most disadvantaged people up here, as these things always seem to do.

1824 2018-08-21 20:18:39 It doesn't have to be full membership - we would be a perfect fit for EFTA - so fishing rights are retained to Scotland, just like our oil & energy.
Norway are chomping at the bit to hook up with us.
They want to see enhanced fishery protection for a start (fish tend to move).

1830 2018-08-21 20:17:42 Last year Venezuela's oil revenues increased from $28 bln to $32 bln.  That would have allowed them to import more goods such as pharmaceuticals.  But they could not because they no longer have access to financial markets due to the sanctions.  This is why imports have fallen.
1831 2018-08-21 20:17:38 get some beard oil and shut the fuck up
1832 2018-08-21 20:17:38 It would be great to take care of everybody in a perfect world.  Yes, there should be some base level of care in any event. However, these programs cost money and that is something the US is running out of.  There isn't any solution from either side, just posturing by politicians
1833 2018-08-21 20:17:33 You forgot to include the word 'don't' before the 'we.' We never have benefited. Ever. Not even for one second. Where is the missing £37 Billion from oil Revenue? Why do we have to pay for Trident? Where is all the duty from Whisky? Why do we have a million people in poverty?

1835 2018-08-21 20:17:00 No idea why some yoons think oil is just a barrel of stuff, that it doesn't make anything else, that WM have mismanaged it so badly they actually have to pay BP. Anyone who believes WM have done the right thing must be blocked

1849 2018-08-21 20:15:15 This is a national emergency! We must get to the source of why this is happening? Because the environmental protection laws have been destroyed by the Trump Administration and Big Oil and the coal industry and the chemical companies like Dow, no longer have any restrictions.

1852 2018-08-21 20:14:45 When I was still a resident I gave myself a nasty contact dermatitis because I bought fancy beard oil (containing tea tree oil). I had such poor insight that I kept using it, and examined skin scrapings under a microscope.

That's what I get for being fancy.

Feel better!

1872 2018-08-21 20:12:46 bruh i just want my oil changed 
1873 2018-08-21 20:12:28 Yes, very much. Chomsky has written extensively on the 'Arab Facade' and how the Western ruling elite use Middle Eastern proxies to control the flow of oil out of that region.
1874 2018-08-21 20:12:20 The Cdls words - supposedly intended to be some weird sort of defense for the Church (benefit of the doubt and for not having to call it pure evil) - resembles  the *braindead* try to ex burning oil with water. 

Now get the Fire Squads going, @Pontifex ...all there are...

1877 2018-08-21 20:12:05 I remember a kid on my block, and we were about same relative size. Picked on me constantly. Finally one day he was walking by and my dad was outside. He pushed me at the kid and said hit him. I was scared shitless. It was hit the kid or get a whipping from

1883 2018-08-21 20:11:14 I mean to the question of "how bad is building windmills?" Needs to be compared to the question of "how much less other stuff happens as a result."

Like "takes 50 energy units to set up a windmill" vs "takes X units to move equivalent oil from under Saudi Arabia to Kansas"
1884 2018-08-21 20:11:02 Germans will never perfect comedy.  They’ll never  figure out how to make it leak oil.

1889 2018-08-21 20:10:30 They would oppose setbacks, because they can't see past the big money once it's waved in their faces. Souls sold for dirt cheap! Colorado needs change. Oil/gas will rape this beautiful place straight to oblivion, the reckoning looms over both parties now; but damage continues.
1890 2018-08-21 20:10:17 and its a Data company just like Facebook. Data is the new Oil.
1891 2018-08-21 20:10:15 The original "real" way to make mayo is egg yolk, vinegar, oil, salt and pepper. Additionally mustard and/or lemon juice can be added in.
1892 2018-08-21 20:10:13 im waiting for my @Influenster @glamglow's new starpotion liquid charcoal clarifying oil #voxbox in the mail even tho i sent it to my apartment and im not there rip. anyway IM EXCITED
1893 2018-08-21 20:10:09 No secret. Oil rich owners. No mystery there.
1894 2018-08-21 20:10:07 ん、これ油変えた？あーなるほど、ごま油をひまわり油で割ったのか。
1895 2018-08-21 20:10:04 Can I just put coconut oil on my problems?
1896 2018-08-21 20:09:57 So,  What is he offering for a super short sentence ?
Only thing I can think of Worth more then all the Oil in the world is his knowledge of Trump, The Con Manage - Tax Evaded, Criminal.... and Worst of all... Possible Traitor to USA (If he knew Russia's endgame is not Trump)
1897 2018-08-21 20:09:50 ok wow the oil mechanic man was stupid hot
1898 2018-08-21 20:09:47 Oh I think ppl were fooled at first of the snake oil salesman but they are bright enough to know when to cut ties and they are doing it at record numbers
1899 2018-08-21 20:09:46 Very much like Nero playing his fiddle while Rome burned…@realDonaldTrump is out golfing as the USA is burning down and drowning. The recent EPA de-regulations regarding coal and oil will make it happen faster. Destroying the world by ignoring climate change
1900 2018-08-21 20:09:39 The US has issued a preliminary duty on pipes from Canada, China, India, and Turkey (Newswires) #oott #tradewars #oil
1901 2018-08-21 20:09:32 I was suppose to get a oil change a whole month ago. Where tf time be going 
1902 2018-08-21 20:09:23 Nope. I have a whole section of clothing I call "oil splatter".
1903 2018-08-21 20:09:22 They start wars after they gain financially through arm deals,oil deals rebuild deals they move on loss intrest #Afghanistan has never been this worse..they failed in #Syria...#Libya and #Iraq are a mess now they want to invade #Iran shame on the Americans
1904 2018-08-21 20:09:15 If that's the case why didn't he call 911 and cite self defense? Why the narcissistic TV interview where he was begging them to come home? Why stuff the girl's bodies in oil drums if he wasn't the true murderer? And why should we believe someone who has already been caught lying?
1905 2018-08-21 20:09:15 pingin kecup keningnya terus kasih peppermint oil di telinga terus selimutin terus nyalain scented candles grapefruit, bobo <3
1906 2018-08-21 20:09:11 So far, three wineries (Peachy Canyon, Castoro, and Opolo) and olive oil tasting at Pasolivo which the boys could do too.
1907 2018-08-21 20:09:06 Oil wells are much less invasive...and they are contained to an area not spread all over every ridge for miles on end.
1908 2018-08-21 20:09:04 So, Amber-bot--- for a refreshing beverage do you prefer an ice cold Budweiser or a quart of Castrol 30 weight motor oil?
1909 2018-08-21 20:09:02 But European companies who could buy Iranian oil or participate in exploration/production are easy targets for US sanctions.
1910 2018-08-21 20:08:39 Nobody realizes that the game being played by the Fed/Treasury is to be sure nothing that could hurt them has any possibility of happening. What could hurt them? 1. An oil rally. 2. A EM rally (tied into #1) 3. A real economic recovery in the U.S. 4. Higher commodity prices.
1911 2018-08-21 20:08:22 Old beauticians are the best when it comes to them good washes and roller sets , hot oil treatments and etc
1912 2018-08-21 20:08:21 According to my readings...this was actually the result of enhanced stress and raised blood pressure...or oil pressure in his case!He didn't really planned this to happen he just...lost his temper for a second!
1913 2018-08-21 20:08:20 shut the fuck up abt new bring me the horizon oil sykes abused his ex wife
1914 2018-08-21 20:08:19 “Fuck canola oil and her singing”     aka Camilia cabello 
1915 2018-08-21 20:07:58 Rick's name will be forever enshrined in everyday use as the name for one of the most beneficial healing compounds ever known to mankind. RSO, Rick Simpson Oil.

Who is fentanyl named after again?
1916 2018-08-21 20:07:54 Canada should impose export duties on oil and gas going to US
1917 2018-08-21 20:07:53 Suck it
1918 2018-08-21 20:07:42 Got $15 off my oil change just for giving the store a 5 star review lol
1919 2018-08-21 20:07:33 We weren't that close.  He moved out of town to do oil field work.  Last I heard he was managing a bit better but still struggling.  His anecdote fit with the fit isn't always healthy.
1920 2018-08-21 20:07:25 Use the following scents and burn them in oil, candle, and incense form to repel bugs from the home: Lavender, palo santo, peppermint, citrus, mint, and citronella.
1921 2018-08-21 20:07:17 Do you understand how sanctions work? 95% of Venezuela’s export revenue comes from oil sold by the state-owned oil company. Cutting off the government’s access to dollars left the economy without the hard currency needed to pay for imports of food and medicine. This hurts people.
1922 2018-08-21 20:07:16 I've heard Rosehip Seed Oil and 100% Aloe Vera will help. I can DM my recommendations if you like.
1923 2018-08-21 20:06:59 I like how out of his whole list of awful shit we do, you only nitpick who profits on oil lol
1924 2018-08-21 20:06:54 They honestly don’t realise that the veil has lifted. We’ve seen the Wizard of Oz! Time for anti-war, anti-corruption politicians. We can do plenty with the £40billion we spend pa. We’ve had enough of military contractors/our forces being used to invade countries for oil. Enough!
1925 2018-08-21 20:06:52 I just got a free oil change in exchange for one of my pen refills. 
1926 2018-08-21 20:06:51 The  CBD oil and the Complete Relaxation Syrup @MattNitz2 @sborchert6844@gmail.com
1927 2018-08-21 20:06:50 @vindictivesoph mate so I hear a knock at the door and open it thinking it's my mum, opens it and there's this nice sweet guy canvassing for a charity and I'm bloody stood there looking like a swamp monster in my nightie with coconut oil all in my hair. I proceeded to reach peak
1928 2018-08-21 20:06:33 Heck yep like, would love to be running the oil into those lovely boobs 
1929 2018-08-21 20:06:31 Hey Kids, don’t sign up for mercinary duty during undemocratic times. You will be fighting for Putin and the Oil tycoons.
1930 2018-08-21 20:06:05 Thats not healthy 
1931 2018-08-21 20:06:04 When both you and your dog didn’t get your CBD oil today so you both just melt into one pile of anxious mess 
1932 2018-08-21 20:06:00 I'm bringing 2 crates of baby oil and a large sheet of plastic ....... I'm just going to slime about naked and  ............ oooow 

What was I thinking? The wife might read this!!!!
1933 2018-08-21 20:05:57 NAN PAMPERS BABY OIL VASELINE SHAMPOO KUZOBA MNANDI
1934 2018-08-21 20:05:44 people that love themselves enough to dab the oil off their pizza have big dick energy
1935 2018-08-21 20:05:29 Wow yeah you would witness your wife killing your babies and then kill her and dump them and her in a crude oil tank. You would be much too distraught to do that. Makes no sense. Coupled with the admission.  I bet he put his wife's hands on them after to make sure her DNA there.
1936 2018-08-21 20:05:07 Im getting an oil change & the dude was like pop your hood & i sat here like a dumb ass like “uhmm sorry how do i do that” lmfao im so embarrassing
1937 2018-08-21 20:05:06 Worthy question; keep in mind it needs to be compared to the same as drilling and transporting oil and gas; mining and distributing coal, etc.
1938 2018-08-21 20:04:59 Haha my coworker got kfc for lunch I was like thanks for reminding me I have to go home and slave over hot oil 
1939 2018-08-21 20:04:53 i LOVEEEE the smell of tea tree oil
1940 2018-08-21 20:04:53 You must have good oil.
1941 2018-08-21 20:04:53 Conservatives are a non-option? Surely you are joking @Tom_Parkin_ . It’s the NDP and their also vacuous but well dressed airhead (“we’ll find other non Saudi or Alberta oil”) for a leader that aren’t an option. Thanks for today’s chuckle.
1942 2018-08-21 20:04:50 What has crude oil got to do with you #ChorCongress giving away crores in loans to defaulters and black listed companies.. Why is there a steep rise in bad debts, NPAs?
why banks bleed money..?
why PC signed off loans and PM approvals in coal scam, 2G scam etcs?
1943 2018-08-21 20:04:48 I have wondered about this as well.  Snake oil salesman is a shorthand says much about the person; more about his audience.
1944 2018-08-21 20:04:46 Castor oil and @MilkStudios Kush Mascara saved my lashes after I ripped off my extensions 
1945 2018-08-21 20:04:43 Especially if the oil I was warmed up.!!! 
1946 2018-08-21 20:04:35 Oil McBurnie is one of the most annoying players I’ve seen, so stroppy!
1947 2018-08-21 20:04:21 who knew an oil change could cost so much money 
1948 2018-08-21 20:03:51 Not representative of all of us. I used to work in oil. Its much more energy dense than solar. Even permitting solar in california deserts has become difficult with CEQA.
1949 2018-08-21 20:03:49 Why do faces produce oil...serious sheen going on over here 
1950 2018-08-21 20:03:49 I reckon that was cod liver oil and malt.
1951 2018-08-21 20:03:31 The facts are that burning coal, oil, gas and anything else you can get you grubby LITTLE hands on is destroying this planet for future generations... But why should you care? You'll be dead and rotting in the ground.
1952 2018-08-21 20:03:12 ♧#3

1953 2018-08-21 20:03:12 Kevin We The People Stand With You, no one is disrespecting the Flag and all those who March at Kent State and supported those who followed in their foot steps need to STAND Against all those who deny us our freedom
1954 2018-08-21 20:03:01 Burning coal and mining coal promotes lung disease, is more costly than natural gas, and it pollutes the air, earth, and water. Your so-called rules only benefit coal and oil/gas companies. This is a dark day for America but a big payoff for the billionaires who are in charge.
1955 2018-08-21 20:02:52 holy shit  if you have ear oil & do it in the shower (like an ear massage) it actually does feel prettty good
1956 2018-08-21 20:02:49 Solar was around in 1930. Try to keep up patawan!  Oil and coal has driven economies for over a century....go ride ur skateboard
1957 2018-08-21 20:02:47 Effects of fish oil: 
-become better swimmer
-smooth skin but only when rubbing in one direction
-strong desire to drive against the flow of traffic when pregnant
1958 2018-08-21 20:02:36 Americans and their glorified child killers, you have young men dying halfway across the globe from home just so that some few rich people can control oil prices as some make a killing selling weapons to the same people killing your “heroes “
1959 2018-08-21 20:02:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
1960 2018-08-21 20:02:31 No Paul. Don't lie.  Solar energy is a huge bc employment opportunity.  Jobs that cannot be outsourced.  All other countries are getting away from coal and oil...but not us, huh.  How much money do you make promoting this garbage. You are a sad representative
1961 2018-08-21 20:02:26 My Dear PM, I am one among Overseas Pakistanis serving in KSA as Project Manager in Oil & Gas Sector. I am Project Management Trainer as well. I want to serve my country under your leadership in Project Management to Build Naya Pakistan for our Generations.
1962 2018-08-21 20:02:26 That bs you just spewed is hilarious. Oil companies have been selling there fields at record paces in Alberta . Investment is at an all time low. Last I checked Saskatchewan actually increased there investment from previous year. Probably due to fact they didn’t want to here!
1963 2018-08-21 20:02:25 CBD oil shows potential for pain relief. It can be used to help manage chronic pain.....pharmaxtracts.com
1964 2018-08-21 20:02:15 True, but by all accounts Clem Attlee wasn’t very charismatic either, yet the NHS and welfare state were created under his leadership. Snake oil salesmen are likely to be charismatic, but I wouldn’t buy from them, would you? :-) Hero leaders are often flawed: 1/2
1965 2018-08-21 20:01:47 Labor Day Incentive!!  See my video on Facebook!!   suzy mclaughlin. CBD Oil for $10!!!!
1966 2018-08-21 20:01:46 It’s sad I have to remind myself to get a oil change  I wish I had a driver check things like that
1967 2018-08-21 20:01:30 Sorry, I can't tonight, I have to avoid us oil sanctions
1968 2018-08-21 20:01:27 @stonertim tim ... any recommendations for good turquoise and naples yellow colurs oil paint or similar or ways of mixing
1969 2018-08-21 20:01:20 No, the bottom line is economics. Gas power plants are cheaper to operate, and the price of renewable energy is dropping as China takes the lead. Artificial efforts to keep coal power alive are like efforts to go back to whale oil.
1970 2018-08-21 20:01:19 Chocolate. Dead easy.  It’s an American recipe that I’ve not converted.  2 cups flour, 2 cups Dark brown sugar, 1.5 tsp baking soda, 1.5 tsp baking powder.  1tsp salt (I omit this usually) 2 large eggs,  1tsp vanilla extract, 3/4 cup veg oil, 1 cup milk, 1 cup espresso coffee. ->
1971 2018-08-21 20:01:19 @protecttheinlet @JustinTrudeau Oceans or Oil?  You have the power to make the right choice.  #itsnottoolate #ClimateChangeIsReal
1972 2018-08-21 20:01:08 You're also welcome to join us for a better beard oil.
1973 2018-08-21 20:01:05 The government of Georgia has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Jonas Brothers in a khādī wig.
1974 2018-08-21 20:01:05 Yes, you are right. We are assuming the girls were dead prior to being put in their oil can tombs. Hopefully, this man had mercy on his own children & did not make them suffer.
1975 2018-08-21 20:00:59 Love to spend my day off getting my oil changed.
Still better than doing it on the weekend
1976 2018-08-21 20:00:59 Not sure where you live but there are lots of places to get a simple oil change...I would pick one of those...
1977 2018-08-21 20:00:39 A healthy diet and lifestyle is a top priority for hearth health, but CBD oil can also help. Research says cannabidiol reduces artery blockage, reduces stress induced cardiovascular response, and can reduce blood pressure. It may also reduce cholesterol.#CBD #CBDOil #life #health
1978 2018-08-21 20:00:38 The Venezuelan regime has had FULL CONTROL of EVERY SINGLE aspect of the economy FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS, and the economy (including oil production which they totally control) has been going downhill in ever increasing decrements year over year for the last 10 years at least.
1979 2018-08-21 20:00:37 Trump going to West Virginia to rile up the base while championing the benefits of mining & 'clean' coal. Then he heads off to Nantucket to rile up the base while calling for a revival of whaling & the whale oil industry. #EconomicAtavism #TrumpIsAMoron

1984 2018-08-21 19:59:52 @bmwcanada @BrianJesselBMW I can’t believe I wait over 15 mins to buy a bottle of engine oil.  Bad customer service!
1985 2018-08-21 19:59:30 Thank you. He gets olive oil in his breakfast. Man he's so fussy!! After having just labradors this is all new to me too!
1986 2018-08-21 19:59:26 I was using it to cook, adding it to my tea, etc and my normally VERY LOW cholesterol skyrocketed.  My doctor pinpointed the coconut oil as the cause and with the elimination my levels dropped back to their normal lows.  Now I use it only to shave my legs. 
1987 2018-08-21 19:59:21 Tea tree oil is a major key for stubborn pimples
1988 2018-08-21 19:59:13 Chorizo Fort ( strong chorizo) garlic onions red wine and olive oil
1989 2018-08-21 19:59:07 Just to temper expectations, beard oil will not likely help your beard grow more full. It will maintain it, but it's unlikely that beard oil will grow what is not there.

 Time is all that you need for future growth. We are what you need for beard maintenance and fragrance.
1990 2018-08-21 19:58:47 I would love a hot oil treatment
1991 2018-08-21 19:58:45 Most definitely- and a little hydraulic oil to keep her running sweet!!
1992 2018-08-21 19:58:34 I love country life and I embrace country stinks, but this is something else! Will have to sleep with windows closed and lavender oil up my nostrils! Worse even than fresh cat poo!!!
1993 2018-08-21 19:58:02 Roasted. Olive oil. Spices. Sometime bacon and honey.  Yum.
1994 2018-08-21 19:57:55 They have gone mad on palm oil. I try an avoid.
1995 2018-08-21 19:57:51 i can almost move up to the next size for my ears and then i can let them take a breather from the stretching and the tape im using. this tape is really bad about sucking up all the oil i use and drying out my ears, so it'll be nice to take a break from this for a little while.
1996 2018-08-21 19:57:38 While we're at bring back whale oil.
1997 2018-08-21 19:57:33 You don't need to smoke it for best results I use an oil that all you do is put a couple of drops under your tongue and its 98% absorbed within minutes!

1999 2018-08-21 19:57:21 Nik you are such a typical bloke. We can actually tell when there’s loads of butter because something tastes, well, buttery. Olive oil I think is less obvious. I think carbs are the devil now though not oil/fat? That’s what I’m living by anyhow.
2000 2018-08-21 19:57:15 Spreading oil and gas waste-water on roads as a deicer or a dust control measure seems like recycling, but it could be exposing humans and wildlife to a radioactive element named radium.
2001 2018-08-21 19:57:10 You might want to drop the palm oil in your ingredients. I cannot support a product that contains #palmoil
2002 2018-08-21 19:57:10 In other words, they got nothing. Just more snake oil BS for the faithful flock of #FoxSheep to feed their heads with. Got it.

2006 2018-08-21 19:56:55 Gullible much? Right-wing talking points are PR and reult of focus group, chosen to sell snake oil. 

Either you're being coned or trying to put one over.
2007 2018-08-21 19:56:52 Did you figure out how to open up all CO land to the ranchers, oil and gas industry? Did you come up with fees for hunting CO's bald eagles after you and @realDonaldTrump get rid of the Endangered Species Act? You will never be what CO needs!
2008 2018-08-21 19:56:41 We have 1996 dodge dakota v 6 for sale motor has only 135000 on it needs body work. Runs good uses very little oil.

2010 2018-08-21 19:56:39 @TATravelCenters  I will never take my truck to that facility Saint Augustine off of I95 and state road 210 again. Also, the service Bay with the pit where they do the oil changes, is an  Environmental mass, and hazard.
2011 2018-08-21 19:56:34 @KevinHart4real @lord_oil I love Kevin Hart and the only decline I see here is the one in @realDonaldTrump’s mental health.
2012 2018-08-21 19:56:18 I'm just saying how can you expect folks to take you seriously when you're blatantly lying the artist and the music should mesh. Not  oil and water. I'm sure it's folks you have heard and knew that the music matched the person it's coming from. Ima mention you again bc truth
2013 2018-08-21 19:56:17 Sociopathic fucking waste of air and resources. She killed my kids but I decided to stuff them in a oil tanker like  fucking trash. Gods this triggers me so bad.
2014 2018-08-21 19:56:06 I bet ur right and I bet more than oil. Anything made or passing threw Canada will be targeted. Prob no more 15 billion dollar military deals to these terrorist in the near future. The US will get in an back the Suadis in covert way to.
2015 2018-08-21 19:56:04 Ud. No entiende. Los inversores están ahora y el proceso si bien se inició antes solo se pudo desarrollar ahora Si Ud. no entiende ni sabe de shale oil/gas no opine No trate de mentiroso a alguien por ignorancia No conoce del tema No opine de ese modo
2016 2018-08-21 19:55:46 #MedicalMarijuana - your opinion?  Mine, been using full spectrum oil for about three months now. Unfortunately, it's not the cure to all that ails me. It's like every other herb and script I take - it helps, but I still have to use coping skills...

2020 2018-08-21 19:55:16 I believe that personal morals are good indicators of their intentions. You believe... whatever comes out of a snake oil salesman's mouth.  We are different and will have to agree not to agree.  I'm ok with that.
2021 2018-08-21 19:55:01 That map looks rather shit for Scots. An oil rich country gets hee-haw. Can you explain that please? I thought you peddled an EQUAL share of wealth? That map rather disproves your theory doesn't it? 
2022 2018-08-21 19:54:50 We came to this moment because of the Kochs. The party they bought. Vladimir Putin. And oil oligarchs.And we fight for the life of our nation.

2029 2018-08-21 19:53:54 My point is whenever commodity producers CAN support/manipulate the market price financially then they will (sometimes for decades) & since 2004 or so oil producers have done just this. In my view China has had enough & is intent on creating a buy-side benchmark & club/cartel
2030 2018-08-21 19:53:51 Agreed. Take this issue seriously please. Match dollar for dollar every subsidy and break we taxpayers give the oil industry

2043 2018-08-21 19:52:48 No such thing as clean coal you moron. A good leader would take some initiative and create jobs in renuable green energy. But you play politics with the gas and oil industry. Again proving not qualified for your job.

2053 2018-08-21 19:51:58 These are various ways in which you can formulate an oil into water, but even if you can't see the oil in the beverage, your body will still process it as such.

2061 2018-08-21 19:50:57 Simple of them all butternut sqaush

You will need (ingredients)
1. Butternut diced into equal cubes
2. Salt and pepper for seasoning 
3. Two spoon of oil

Preparation

Get you oven on 180°C or 200°C 
Mix all ingredients and put them on a baking tray
Roast for roughly  30 mins
2062 2018-08-21 19:50:52 Just a little  fat can improve “sponginess” and texture...but you are right, it can be olive oil and not palm oil.
2063 2018-08-21 19:50:50 Depends on the timeframe. Over the short term, it’d fall quite a lot (depending on whether pickups and larger trucks are electrified too). Longer term, crashing oil prices would induce demand in other sectors.
2064 2018-08-21 19:50:46 Russia could supply all of the ChiCom oil needs... thus makes little sense unless they are purposely trying to create themselves more problems.
2065 2018-08-21 19:50:45 I always justify it by the fact that I only have one face, and that I am not in my 20s anymore  The product I truly love is a the shimmering body oil. Used it till the very last drop.
2066 2018-08-21 19:50:38 Depends where the energy comes from.  The sun is a great provider.  Oil is not.  All electronic devices require power.  Moan at your power provider if you're concerned about using electricity.

2151 2018-08-21 19:41:54 Can't wait for the Western dependence on oil to end. If South Africa had oil, Apartheid would be still in place and Nelson Mandela would have died in prison (at least they would not have executed him).
2152 2018-08-21 19:41:45 I hate getting my oil changed without a guy with me because I feel like they always try to get me to buy everything. “Hey ma’am you need new tires we have some right over here”
2153 2018-08-21 19:41:22 @realDonaldTrump The United States will be eliminated, so you are dare to deal with the Iranian regime. These countries can forever tell you not to surrender, but it does not make any sense. All sanctions, especially the sanctions on oil,will be implemented without any derogation
2154 2018-08-21 19:41:13 Crude oil rallies for fourth straight session
2155 2018-08-21 19:41:11 I have a lot of friends who think manufacturing cheap plastic products in China and selling on Amazon to make money is the greatest thing ever… I see them pillaging oil and creating waste that will end up in the oceans for profit :( not sure how to help. it's a culture problem.
2156 2018-08-21 19:41:09 hopefully you realize that with comments like Kevin Hart made or Michelle Wolf or Kathy Griffin or "insert any Hollywood name here", that it only drives people to vote for GOP.  That plus fake news of MSM and people will keep GOP in office for next 100 years.
2157 2018-08-21 19:41:02 thank u! i've heard about bio oil but i'm always skeptical to buy it idk why jdsnjdns
2158 2018-08-21 19:41:00 Coconut oil hair treatment and face mask tonight, with a glass of the finest wine ya digg
2159 2018-08-21 19:40:56 Shame on this government which is using oil for its extra revenue on falsified assumptions.
2160 2018-08-21 19:40:46 Cool. You get familiar with your vehicle here, cus you have to put gas, oil, water, air in it unless you take it in for a service and pay astronomical amounts to do it. Feels foreign to me when I’m out there and just pay someone to pump my petrol 
2161 2018-08-21 19:40:33 狗狼くーん！あっ違ったカミ君ー！
2162 2018-08-21 19:40:24 Pure vitamin e oil every night will have it gone in no time  
It helped me completely  fade a black wax burn scar I had on my face
2163 2018-08-21 19:40:20 Try using Pure Royal
Jamaican Castor Oil.. That hairline will be back before you know it..it costs less than R90 at Clicks.
2164 2018-08-21 19:40:20 Yes. At what point does the sanctions become a blatant act of war like the oil sanctions put on Japan before WW2 ? This is why Russia should have countered with serious sanctions earlier. Like halting all titanium exports. Because that would be cheaper than war.
2165 2018-08-21 19:40:13 ぼくに言わせればワセリンすら食用だよ。
2166 2018-08-21 19:40:10 No one paid anything, so where do the fundings come from to drop for oil, to grow crops, or to manufacture product?  Since your feel monies would be outmoded, can I ask that you come work for me?  Since money is worthless to you, I will not have to pay you.
2167 2018-08-21 19:40:08 That’s how one guest stole my perfume oil . 
I can’t wait to know the person on judgment day .
2168 2018-08-21 19:40:05 Family Nutrition: General Mills #Bugles this August? Its top four ingredients are corn meal, coconut oil, sugar and salt.
2169 2018-08-21 19:40:03 ya I like being back and all but now my car needs an oil change AND my tire pressure is low ... I need my dad
2170 2018-08-21 19:39:50 Guys that comment under every girls picture on social media, and guys that send unsolicited dick pics masturbate with palm oil.
2171 2018-08-21 19:39:31 I know mate, it's embarrassing. Would never have happened under Gill & SAF, if anything was going on it was always kept in house to protect the club. Football is fucked cuz of money now. It'll become a common thing for clubs unless they're backed by oil money
2172 2018-08-21 19:39:25 Hahaha... The "Mid-East" oil reserves? Hahahaha
As far as the Strait of Hormuz (note the spelling). How long do you think it would take British, French, and US assets to "take it back"?? Get real brother, you're drinking the Kool-Aid. 1. Venezuela (20.2 percent)
2173 2018-08-21 19:39:16 Dont let anyone disrupt your inner peace, go on sleep now, sleep tight.
2174 2018-08-21 19:39:04 Coal is so yesterday. More jobs in clean/renewable energy sector. So I'm not buying your snake oil.
2175 2018-08-21 19:39:03 @TATravelCenters  However I felt like I was overcharged. Elemi explain why, I have a 2014 freightliner Cascadia and I only wanted oil change will filter change and chassis , In which I brought my own grease brand name,  Motorkote.  I really appreciate the opportunity
2176 2018-08-21 19:39:01 it is not socialism. Venezuela's horizon darkened when the price of oil began to fall,  from over $98 a barrel in July 2014 to just over $47 by the end of that  year. It averaged just over $35 in 2016.   The country's oil-dependent revenues took a massive hit.
2177 2018-08-21 19:38:58 ??? What is your point ?? If people do not like the price of oil let them not buy and try to live with some other form of energy.
2178 2018-08-21 19:38:55 The reason is Kerala is now bankrupt...no money even for daily expenses..this floods came like putting oil in fire..so begging and shouting..If Kerala were separate country it's situation would be worse than venezuala
2179 2018-08-21 19:38:50 Trying to save time & money for your business in the #oil industry? #RFID is making traction in the oil industry for valve tracking.
2180 2018-08-21 19:38:49 @daniecal this works brilliantly for me. I still use a primer though and my makeup lasts all day. If I feel I'm too shiny I blot with an oil sheet
2181 2018-08-21 19:38:39 Oil, Browns, tag,
2182 2018-08-21 19:38:32 @MaramaDavidson how much oil do we buy of these thugs. How much more will we buy as a result of our no extraction policy in New Zealand.
2183 2018-08-21 19:38:24 Who doesn't want a luxury pickup truck that burns more oil and gas while crowding streets with a truck bed that you will never use? Best to cripple the fuckin' thing with a lift kit and lowrider wheels you hipster, you #movingtomars #Laredo #luxurytravel
2184 2018-08-21 19:38:04 If he had sold snake oil, Obama would have been his best friend ... Obama will go down as not just the worst "President" in history but one of the most EVIL humans (?) of all time ... along with HRC ... WAKE UP
2185 2018-08-21 19:38:03 I bet they cut off oil if this gets out of hand
2186 2018-08-21 19:37:54 Have you tried CBD oil?
2187 2018-08-21 19:37:53 I just heated up leftover pasta from Cheesecake Factory and had to drain like a full cup of oil from it. No wonder their food has so many calories .
2188 2018-08-21 19:37:44 Now you've changed socialism into communism. Of course there is private ownership under socialism.
Standard Oil sold to the Nazis, iirc, right up to our entry into the war.
Come back when your argument makes sense.
2189 2018-08-21 19:37:17 Moroccan oil makes my hair smell lush 
2190 2018-08-21 19:37:01 I too love to give my toddler the finest oil paints and brushes to own the modernist arts establishment
2191 2018-08-21 19:36:59 Filter smashes Americano every day. Filter = gravity = light coffee complexion. Americano = machine forced = motor oil ;-)
2192 2018-08-21 19:36:55 Want to see the Indy Eleven play the Toronto FC II? LIKE this post for a chance to win FOUR tickets to the match on Wednesday, August 22th at 7pm at Lucas Oil Stadium! Winners announced tomorrow morning!
2193 2018-08-21 19:36:53 Just like the left wing media that sells snake oil, poison and just plain old shit to everyone stupid enough to watch. Yea makes sense to me. Moron.
2194 2018-08-21 19:36:51 That's a pretty creative interpretation of "expanded their welfare states largely with oil wealth".
2195 2018-08-21 19:36:49 One of the final ‘big jobs’ done today. Oil tank re-sited. Needed to be done to properly comply. Only took me 2 hrs but a bit of a faff draining and refilling.
New stable door this Friday. And then just a few remaining paint jobs and detailing #Thirskcottage
2196 2018-08-21 19:36:44 What was the first oil you used that made you say - "Yep these babies work!!!"
2197 2018-08-21 19:36:41 Here we go goons

Deficit = 13bn with 100% of oil

Q 

How much oil rev does it require to get rid of that pesky deficit 

Now lets see if you lot know what a 6 year old would know ..
2198 2018-08-21 19:36:34 yuh must oil down first
2199 2018-08-21 19:36:34 U will tell them u dont want oil meat,they will still put it..
2200 2018-08-21 19:36:16 A restructured Nigeria will make the presidency very unattractive. Why we don't want this beats my imagination. We had it before and the world took notice of Nigeria with palm oil, groundnut pyramids, cocoa etc. What really is our problem with doing simple things in Nigeria?
2201 2018-08-21 19:36:03 if you bring in a coupon for the wrong oil change you can just act dumb and they’ll still give you $5 off :)
2202 2018-08-21 19:36:01 The world is burning... we need to, as many others are doing, divest in Oil/gas... That sector has already pissed away billions...
2203 2018-08-21 19:35:51 Do you not decarb on purpose?

How do you injest the oil, capsules or under the toungue?

No idea you could just let it sit and evaporate, thought you had to cook it.
2204 2018-08-21 19:35:42 Well, today my journey starts of using CBD oil for my anxiety.. Let’s see how this goes.
2205 2018-08-21 19:35:40 Olive oil! Avocado oil! .... middle class heaven
2206 2018-08-21 19:35:30 Parkinsons, cancer, digestive issues and allergies? Wow, that's some oil. Could you provide scientific evidence for all of these claims please?
2207 2018-08-21 19:35:20 Or just move to different city. Not defending yourself invites more attacks. This beast is huge, dangerous and well past the normal considerations you're suggesting.
2208 2018-08-21 19:35:19 I loved our 83 GL5. I still have the book the first owner kept of every oil change.
2209 2018-08-21 19:35:12 Looks like he fell asleep with his head in an oil pan!  
2210 2018-08-21 19:35:10 Its a rather short thread to be as bad as you say. Lighten up. Maybe you need to take a break from social media. Make that all forms of media. That does wonders for a reality check, for gaining back some common sense.
2211 2018-08-21 19:34:57   i use @_BrothersBeard oil and balm now... just need that brush and comb set now 
2212 2018-08-21 19:34:46 Awesome. Coal, steel, oil, gas, manufacturing. #MAGA
2213 2018-08-21 19:34:41 I personally use the 500mg oil
It's a 50 day supply and is $69.00  per bottle
2214 2018-08-21 19:34:27 Ah but coal is actually killing people, Ryan.  Adding millions to our health care crisis.  Your premise is simplistic and wrong.  We need to get off fossil fuels, but you care mostly about oil companies $$.
2215 2018-08-21 19:34:26 There's so much to be gained from Twitter, so I won't leave it because the engine oil for some of una brain don black. Instead I'll just be using ako na uche to follow you people.
2216 2018-08-21 19:34:18 Shut down the fossil fool gangs and stop their wars for oil, gas, pipelines. End their control of the global energy industry. Stop their illegal geo-engineering SAI program, they want to use it, so they can continue business as usual. #OiligarchGate #BakkenGate #OligarchGate
2217 2018-08-21 19:34:06 1600 people in 12 years on a speculative observation. This is snake oil shit right here. Your lead in is so over dramatic for this greenhouse gas limits on power plants will cause as many as 1,630 additional premature deaths annually by 2030
2218 2018-08-21 19:34:00 Breastfeeding sucks the life out of skin hair and nails. Your hormones are also trying to balance themselves out. Keep up on prenatals and try doing a mousturizing tea tree oil mask once a week. 
2219 2018-08-21 19:33:59 Yeah I agree. Only reason I see them putting someone else in the car is if Lucas Oil wanted them to
2220 2018-08-21 19:33:57 Not long ago, oil and gas were estimated to account for sixty percent of the gdp of Azerbaijan.
2221 2018-08-21 19:33:52 #HubYes, and I can name a few that would be brilliant candidates: North Wilkesboro, South Boston, Lucas Oil Raceway Park, Bowman-Gray Stadium, etc.
2222 2018-08-21 19:33:40 The only play that I imagine you can make is for the oil and other natural resources found in northern Canada. 

My view might also be ignorant of the fact that drones and computers make armies less valuable in today’s world for combat
2223 2018-08-21 19:33:37 oil pan cap fuckin vanished im beat sauce
2224 2018-08-21 19:33:22 I only know REAL pizza, fake one is not contemplated here where I live. We only use fresh tomatoes for the sauce, good olive oil, fresh mozzarella and all the good stuff. Also the water makes a lot of difference. Obviously the Naples one is the best!
2225 2018-08-21 19:33:12 David Charlton is "very #optimistic. Oil and water cleanup could become bigger than the lubricant business ever was for Rice Oil"
2226 2018-08-21 19:33:02 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt. #Tucson
2227 2018-08-21 19:32:51 それ聞いたことある！
サボテンのIQにむしろ驚きだわ
2228 2018-08-21 19:32:48 I think IMF wanted us to be exactly where we are then we can trade the "Kenya Oil" with a super power. 

LOL we screwed.
2229 2018-08-21 19:32:46 Tea tree oil broke me out so bad fuck all you honestly
2230 2018-08-21 19:32:43 Dove or oil of olay are good basic soaps. Maybe cortisone cr. wld be better than aquaphor as the petrolatum can cause breakouts. Don't be overly aggressive w/skin.
2231 2018-08-21 19:32:29 The collapse of Soviet Russia happened virtually overnight in 1991 when power transferred from Gorbachev to Yeltsin, it had little to do with oil prices which remained above production cost until 1998. Trump has cleaned out European pension holders of value, he is a thug
2232 2018-08-21 19:32:26 That moment when you realize you left your oil at home and there is. Storm coming in.  — feeling pained
2233 2018-08-21 19:32:21 They told me my oil change was goin be an hour half wait and that shit didn't even take 45 mins
2234 2018-08-21 19:32:14 I keep getting followed by god fearing oil engineers in America with no followers 
2235 2018-08-21 19:32:10 I agree, more or less.  Not all fiat currencies are as bad as others.  Certainly the US dollar is in bad shape if it's removed as the reserve currency for oil.  

As a libertarian, I'm skeptical or opposed to all fiat currency for this very reason.
2236 2018-08-21 19:32:03 Oil money sure does. Who is to say mcity can't come in the picture. We are just speculating right now.
2237 2018-08-21 19:31:51 But I guess the point of the meme isn't to be fair so nevermind. Would've been clearer if she said social democracies are reliant on cheap oil rather than on oil wealth.
2238 2018-08-21 19:31:47 BBC  shld talk about illuminati involvement in politics  of UK & USA.Y JFK was assinated?how Israel  was created?and how colonial powers just looted half of the world.focus on CIA toppling govt around the world..how for (gold ,oil and drugs)CIA and MI6 destroy  countries..
...
2239 2018-08-21 19:31:39 I went to rockaway dumb clapped off oil bro I went in that water it was knocking my ass out on god I felt like I was in a tsunami
2240 2018-08-21 19:31:33 tape over glass and a metal bitt or a diamond bitt also use some oil as lube and do it very very slowly
after that sand it very good glass splinters are seriously not fun
2241 2018-08-21 19:31:26 Thought of the Day. "Do you realise if we reduce the use of oils by 60% our oil supply will last 3 times longer than it does now.".
2242 2018-08-21 19:31:26 Ya boi is officially a full blown PA state inspection certified technician. But on the other hand that's gonna be useless in a month because I'm finally transferring to one of the companies body shops after a year of doing oil changes. I'm finally on the come up 
2243 2018-08-21 19:31:26 Im a man shitty fan and i admit that man shitty is an oil arab plastic club and is a disgrace to english football
2244 2018-08-21 19:31:24 Canola Oil  Deeeaaaadddd!
2245 2018-08-21 19:31:06 Coffee is the second-most traded commodity in the whole world, after the crude oil.
2246 2018-08-21 19:31:04 i can’t believe the guys who changed my oil made a bet on my age 
2247 2018-08-21 19:31:03 Davy to the Oil is like when you're always dumping your gf/bf trying to find something better, then when you're desperate(horny) you beg them to come back. Smh
2248 2018-08-21 19:31:00 This is true, but the tweet is still bad. You don't need tremendous wealth to be a social democracy, and it's a better model than small government conservatism, not one that needs to be subsidized with oil or anything

2250 2018-08-21 19:30:46 1st of all, I really like Kevin Hart's comedy.  Freedom of speech is important. Trump's a big boy & he can take it as well as dishing it out & doesn't need help defending himself. 2ndly, who the heck is still watching these crap TV awards shows anyway? Not me.  I'm sick of them.
2251 2018-08-21 19:30:29 and yet it's the tax payer's responsibility to subsidize trillions in subsidies for oil giants, rockets that kill yemeni and afghan children, and the military-industrial complex, but giving everyone healthcare is too much to ask? give me a break buddy

2254 2018-08-21 19:30:04 I will ban myself now.
2255 2018-08-21 19:30:00 Officials from the companies involved in @peabodyenergy's partnership with oil trader Vitol and startup Arq, say the deal suggests a willingness from the coal industry to consider unconventional revenue sources.
2256 2018-08-21 19:29:48 Cooking stew is an extreme sport. The number of times the oil has jumped onto my hand 
2257 2018-08-21 19:29:45 Climate change does not stop at state borders. It's a world wide application and if we don't lead China will. Stupid big oil giveaway
2258 2018-08-21 19:29:43 I saw where North and South Korean families are reuniting after 40’s. What’s the population on North Korea? Lot of rare minerals in there and poppy too: any proposed oil and gas lines or discoveries?
2259 2018-08-21 19:29:41 I didn't call it poison. I think that's going a little too far. But coconut oil has no nutritional value or health benefits. Some people believe it is some kind of health food and it is most certainly not. It's a pure saturated fat on par with lard, margarine, etc.
2260 2018-08-21 19:29:35 it would still be really sweet if they shut down that oil production
2261 2018-08-21 19:29:22 People, people, it's the current year. Let's not assume anyone's gender.
2262 2018-08-21 19:29:18 Trump trashes and bashes people all the time.  You don't have any problems with that @KevinHart4real was funny & nothing he said wasn't true.  So Kick Rocks.  Don't go see his movies, I'll go twice to make up for one your lost ticket.
2263 2018-08-21 19:29:14 DOE selling 11 million barrels from SPR. The U.S. Department of Energy is selling 11 million barrels of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve ahead of the November deadline for U.S. sanctions on Iran. The proposed sale of sour crudes are slated for October 1 through Nov 30.
2264 2018-08-21 19:29:13 All those things were up under O...where were you then decrying it?  Remember when gas got so high, and then food went up due to high cost of transporting it? Seniors did not get a COLA, was blamed on price of oil. Insurance in AZ we were told would go up 117% by 2017..so shut up
2265 2018-08-21 19:29:07 At the quick lube changing my oil.
2266 2018-08-21 19:29:04 on the open roads trouble-free!

Whether you are looking for basic maintenance done to your Ford vehicle, such as oil changes, brake replacement, tire changes and more, to body damage repair from an unfortunate accident to drive train replacement from catastrophic failure,
2267 2018-08-21 19:29:03 Slippery self-serving snake  oil Salesman!
2268 2018-08-21 19:28:33 oil and money the USA is not shy to kill for, kids women men, unarmed people, makes no difference is not a question of moral or human rights un, fortunately, is business.
2269 2018-08-21 19:28:27 Thank you Jesus my coworker put her miracle oil on me or I would’ve been went off at this point  the power of faith is so powerful
2270 2018-08-21 19:28:23 This is even more painful, sallah meat, person no see chop, even the oil make person take rob mouth person no see, why does bad thing happen to good people sef?

2271 2018-08-21 19:27:55 
2272 2018-08-21 19:27:52 @adamcarolla  what's your opinion on oil catch cans? Myth or Must?
2273 2018-08-21 19:27:50 It looks like Nivea firming body oil.
2274 2018-08-21 19:27:47 Another assault on the Arctic ice, where oil drillers are slavering and waiting in the wings for the big meltdown.
2275 2018-08-21 19:27:47 If enough countries stopped trading oil in dollars, our cash would only be good to burn for heat during the winter. None of that justifies the unconstitutional existence of the Fed.
2276 2018-08-21 19:27:39 Cash Wash, Oil Change, & a full tank got me feelin like I can’t be stopped 
2277 2018-08-21 19:27:37 Death penalty should be in an oil tank ... I have NO MERCY for the EVIL he has done - to 4 precious lives and loving family & friends!!!! #Prayers #prayers (her dad )
2278 2018-08-21 19:27:35 Oh shittttttttt is this that situation where Waze takes you to the fucking weirdest route fuck cuz ive had it just now. It says turn right but that right is just like a palm oil farm and there arent any tarred roads. Nasib baik bapak aku power instinct dia tak ikut jeez
2279 2018-08-21 19:27:23 I can’t believe that man killed his wife and kids & then put them in oil tanks. That’s sick asf
2280 2018-08-21 19:27:16 Try an olive oil mask.  But stay out of the kitchen!
2281 2018-08-21 19:27:14 It may play out that way. But re: sentiment, I just can’t shake the oil market bullish sentiment hitting all times highs, when, back in Q1? Yet shorting crude continues to be a widowmaker trade in 2018. Can’t help but wonder if a similar logic-defying rally in cards for USD
2282 2018-08-21 19:27:12 Does anyone know of a good oil to use on metal tools after the rust is removed to keep the rust from coming back? All I have is mineral oil (and I use that on me) Thanks if you are able to help
2283 2018-08-21 19:27:11 Trudeau virtue signals, we should not buy oil from any oppressive regime.

2288 2018-08-21 19:26:33 That's what he felt those babies deserved was to be dump on an oil tank. If she killed them why would he dump them in an oil tank what a peice of crap. Maybe they shud Dump him in a crap tank.
2289 2018-08-21 19:26:31 Writing down a list before i go shopping is honestly the biggest lie i tell myself. I’ll write down “boxes for packing” and come home with an oil defuser that talks to you
2290 2018-08-21 19:26:26 So what she only asked a legitimate question.  That’s prob the only way she could come across to ask it.  It was for the sake of the country not a anti oil activist hanging from bridges.
2291 2018-08-21 19:26:15 If I didn’t need full synthetic oil, I’d be heeeellllla straight lol
2292 2018-08-21 19:26:00 A5. An excursion in Mykonos led us to try to replicate their strapatsada (tomato, feta, egg and olive oil) breakfast. We’re still trying to master it ... it’s surprisingly simple yet difficult!  #TBINChat
2293 2018-08-21 19:26:00 Those expansions have led to extreme inflation, immense wealth inequality, total reliance on credit, devaluation of our currency, fractional reserve banking, massive national debt, and total reliance on the rest of the world trading oil in dollars to artificially retain its value

2299 2018-08-21 19:25:36 #TakeFive Oil Change says they will no longer sell conventional oil for your oil change -- they will ONLY sell "synthetic blend" oil. I immediately stopped the techs before they could drain my oil, drove away, then called Corporate. ...
2300 2018-08-21 19:25:36 Well I live in Maui and Hawaiians have it as part of their diet for centuries. I know quite a few of them are in their 90s and a few over a 100 years old. Everybody  reacts to coconut oil Etc differently. Studies do not include a person's entire diet. Coconut oil is not poison!
2301 2018-08-21 19:25:33 Two 2! Stations in NL by Shell, sponsored ones. Thats no adventure, thats a fat elephant on the sofa. Thought Shell and Co want to transform from oil to x in the next decade. But, besides that, interesting numbers – TIL 230 of the 240 h2stations in Germany are maintained by Shell
2302 2018-08-21 19:25:32 Hapu this man, how much oil do they have. Make e no be situation wey humble the man
2303 2018-08-21 19:25:10 Only a few people out there know how much condensate on a natural gas engine will fuck up your whole day. Smells worst than gas, sticks more than oil and is more flammable than diesel.
2304 2018-08-21 19:25:05 If we build a bitumen pipeline with public money & expand the tar sands we can then have more jobs in the oil industry and more jobs fighting fires, fixing flooding, and cleaning up oil spills. See the environment and the economy do go hand-in-hand. #Cdnpoli #Canpoli

2319 2018-08-21 19:24:07 Coal is dead you doofus. Start focusing on clean, renewable energy instead of protecting the dinosaur big oil that will not accept there is a reason we don't have telephone operators, ice delivery, Blockbusters anymore. Old and obsolete. Like you.
2320 2018-08-21 19:24:03 W/r/t decreasing ultra-processed foods (which are high in carbs and seed oil fats), everyone would agree, and there's lots of good evidence that reducing them is good. The key Q is whether *low-carb* is necessary, or just better forms of carbs and fats. My sense is the latter.
2321 2018-08-21 19:23:56 So you are advocating nationalizing those private businesses, so they would fall under the 1st amendment?

Why not nationalize oil refiners then? Where is your red line?
2322 2018-08-21 19:23:50 I miss working with oil pastels ;(

2330 2018-08-21 19:22:43 Let me put this oil treatment in my hair
2331 2018-08-21 19:22:40 @jimmy_dore 20 million people without Healthcare and yet we can fast track the MDA and spend another 700 some odd billion dollars to keep our control over the global oil industry.  #americaincorporated
2332 2018-08-21 19:22:21 #Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Tuesday that new U.S. sanctions introduced over alleged hacking and illegal oil products supply to #NorthKorea were groundless, promising a response from #Moscow.

2334 2018-08-21 19:22:15 I have not owned any of these since 2014. They need 5% growth in oil prices that was assumed up until fracking disrupted the industry but maybe that worm will turn related to lack of investment in offshore and fracking returns not measuring up. Read cap-ex decline! We shall see.
2335 2018-08-21 19:22:05 Need a recommendation for a place with a good price for an oil change this baby takes 10 quarts of oil

2342 2018-08-21 19:20:56 Please scream this at @SpeakerRyan I have no idea why he is fighting for fossil fuel as WI is not a coal or oil producing state. In fact frm personal experience they're doing a great job of embracing wind power which creates lots of new jobs.
2343 2018-08-21 19:20:52 It’s obviously a new one as there is no oil dropping off it
2344 2018-08-21 19:20:39 Only 3 Questions?
2345 2018-08-21 19:20:22 What sauce do you like? We usually stick with oil and vinegar.
2346 2018-08-21 19:20:07 better do your homework in this classroom.  Teacher fed up with student saying the dog ate the homework.
2347 2018-08-21 19:19:58 Oil prices collapse and costly war in Afghanistan proved very damaging reagan accelerated US defence spending that soviets cud not match and supported anti communist movements around the world.
2348 2018-08-21 19:19:52 Nothing. Most oils in the ACMPR are either sunflower oil, MCT, or grape seed.  Olive oil is likely not preferred because of either colour, strong flavour, or lower smoke point (which is related to oil stability/rancidity). In fact any oil that is liquid at room temperature is ok
2349 2018-08-21 19:19:41 You love your kids so much you dump their bodies in barrels of oil?

2353 2018-08-21 19:19:33 Oh Jesus Stress oil required!
2354 2018-08-21 19:19:28 Yes. Dries out the skin and causes oil over production. I used to have this issue until I stopped using matte products and started hydrating properly
2355 2018-08-21 19:19:09 Gun Oil, very nourishing.

2357 2018-08-21 19:19:01 I work in the oil patch. Last month someone asked me to add orifice size to the Low DP Report. I wondered if Larry Flynt ever asked for the same thing. It's perfectly legit in my business (his too, but very different meaning).

2365 2018-08-21 19:18:01 Forget about a cancer cure having been found I’m positive someone has made a car that doesn’t run off gas and big oil killed em. Weren’t the first cars like powered by steam? And those mf hadn’t even figured out to make the bike wheels the same size yet
2366 2018-08-21 19:17:56 When I think of real world privacy implications I worry about people who might buy into some sort of snake oil that they've been lead to believe will protect their privacy that is little more than security theater at best. Shouldn't we be attacking those devices first? 4/4
2367 2018-08-21 19:17:45 No. Esso oil.

2369 2018-08-21 19:17:34 agreed. Last season was awesome watching Ohio State whip Wisconsin in  from Indy, and then walking to Lucas Oil and watching them whip Wisconsin in an hour later. Quite the double dip. #gobucks
2370 2018-08-21 19:17:33 Uranium from Niger keeps the lights on in Paris. Look at this as another oil state.
2371 2018-08-21 19:17:29 It's one thing to read about it or know about it academically, but to drive along, investigate, etc., from oil field to export terminal, is something else entirely. I wish I had more time to spend in the communities I stopped. I hope to see your photos soon!
2372 2018-08-21 19:17:12 There is another piece of that picture somewhere with somekind of oil on it ...ewww

2375 2018-08-21 19:16:43 The nordic model is not a less rational model than small government conservatism, and therefore doesn't need to be subsidized by oil or anything else. 

No one has expanded any welfare states since the 80s anyway

2386 2018-08-21 19:15:23 driving through the communities along rail lines and pipelines, or driving through natural areas to see scores of mile-long oil trains, pipeline construction, and compressor stations - it struck me how entrenched but delicate/tenuous much of our energy infrastructure is.
2387 2018-08-21 19:15:22 Or throw oil on the road when you step on the gas?  
2388 2018-08-21 19:15:16 Indians r panoti last time they allied with Soviet Union it broke, before that ghandi established good relations with British it started loosing colonies... Now they r allied with Americans and have stopped buying oil from Iran on their orders... US hegemony is incrsly contested
2389 2018-08-21 19:15:14 This situation reminds me of how oil producers play with oil prices by adjusting productiion...

2392 2018-08-21 19:14:54 Of course, these slime buckets would be happy to make a few bucks on the way out the door. When oil goes up, so does gold and silver.. I'm sure they are placing their bets....
2393 2018-08-21 19:14:40 Getting my oil changed. I don't like driving into the bay so I always ask one of the techs to do it. Several mins go by before I see my truck pull in. They had to wait for the 1 guy who could drive a standard to be free. 
Do they make standards anymore?
2394 2018-08-21 19:14:21 I wish the burgers didn't have canola oil in them. :(  If they didn't then they would fit into the Whole Foods Plant Based eating plan like the Forks Over Knives program.  There's just too much fat in them. Get rid of that Canola oil and I'd buy a case!

2410 2018-08-21 19:12:24 I have no desire to see Gumps ugly smug on TV...rather listen to a small black man making me laugh...Pres Gump make me  puke while I'm "grabbing her right in the pussy"...great..gump just great..Those a great words for the History Books coming out of our Pres....
2411 2018-08-21 19:12:12 How the hell do you know? Even if they were a capitalist government their main export would be Oil. And their businesses would have tanked. You have no idea what you're talking about.
2412 2018-08-21 19:12:01 oh for sure. They've done a good job overall but my point is that they would likely have achieved oil neutrality without burning reserves
2413 2018-08-21 19:11:38 Very sad all nations keep silent, just because they have the oil, boycott them
2414 2018-08-21 19:11:33 Just looked it up, it’s got cannabis oil in it - no wonder it makes my lashes so long & nourished  the $24 is worth it
2415 2018-08-21 19:11:33 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2416 2018-08-21 19:11:21 I think our oil diffuser died 
2417 2018-08-21 19:11:13 Through baptism in boiling oil, they can be redeemed.

2419 2018-08-21 19:10:51 only for hoping for real news, i would turn off being turned off by shep smiths frothing at the mouth while he stutters "if" as if his wet dreams just came true. sorry for being crude but shep's crude way to dig for Trump oil as if he might strike it rich deserves nothing less.
2420 2018-08-21 19:10:50 There won't be a bloody dividend. They've said the supposed dividend will be spent on about 16 different things. Norway and Switzerland have a lot more money from tax/oil than we do. Stop talking nonsense. Get real.
2421 2018-08-21 19:10:50 Just got my oil changed by a female auto attendant.

This pleases me greatly.
2422 2018-08-21 19:10:32 a week in the life of dylan:

2428 2018-08-21 19:09:53 Coconut oil + Skin = A Fucking Duo
2429 2018-08-21 19:09:50 Yes.... Because things like oil pipelines never go up in value 
2430 2018-08-21 19:09:44 so I just put water in a pan with hot oil ,,, bad idea
2431 2018-08-21 19:09:42 The members of the West Virginia Oil & Natural Gas Association appreciate the steady leadership and years of dedicated public service provided by House Speaker Tim @ArmsteadWV.  Thank you for your service to our state!
2432 2018-08-21 19:09:38 get out of my Kurdistan you Muslims! you just came and killing is for oil water land gold, go to hell and work for yourself!!
2433 2018-08-21 19:09:33 Do it, I'd love to follow along! It's really been something to "trace" the routes of our energy infrastructure from origination to export/destination, e.g., with coal and oil from the mine or oilfield, along pipeline and rail routes, and finally to coastal export terminals --
2434 2018-08-21 19:09:28 How to know if you're in the wrong relationship: your bf thinks it's okay to dump used motor oil in the woods
2435 2018-08-21 19:09:27 So do I declare myself to strip, and anoint thy body therewith as with oil;
2436 2018-08-21 19:09:26 Just walked out of Athens Walmart with a quart of motor oil and a bottle of shampoo and they have accepted me as a townie
2437 2018-08-21 19:09:25 Yes I dont watch the National news....simce Gump bought the office...and fires everyone who tells the truth......white house is a joke....
2438 2018-08-21 19:09:17 And there was me thinking pure tea tree oil would be a nice smell.... I’m not putting that anywhere near me!
2439 2018-08-21 19:09:11 I need an oil change ASAP!

2445 2018-08-21 19:08:10 I always prefer a really nice olive oil
2446 2018-08-21 19:08:01 cuz our land is full of water, oil, gold. middle east is based on our water. so muslims are killing us to survive
2447 2018-08-21 19:07:56 that would never happen kiss the feet of an idiot....with a loud mouth...
2448 2018-08-21 19:07:49 What is it w/MAGA's & that stupid You all use it like words fail you. Get a dictionary & learn to express yourself with words instead of pictures.  It's like reading a cave painting reading a MAGA tweet.
2449 2018-08-21 19:07:43 Who is BHP selling shale oil too?? Overseas?
2450 2018-08-21 19:07:37 To each their own, but you can get bent if you think smoking weed/oil every day in excess is actually healthy for your brain or body. Most def not something to be promoted as such even if it “works” for you.
2451 2018-08-21 19:07:37 Or we could try living in countries that have social democracy and a mixed aconomy that isn’t attacked by right wing sanctions for Big Oil. Smh.

2454 2018-08-21 19:07:05 luxury condo buildings that fill up with people from the suburbs to the detriment of current residents and massive rent increases - this is not a housing crisis solution
2455 2018-08-21 19:07:02 JP Morgan in my opinion makes broad statements about issues that seems to artificially deflate a emerging stock. Like lithium’s or Tesla. Why. How much do you bet they have heavy oil stock. Also to pump and dump. To use auto computers to siege a killer buy and sell.
2456 2018-08-21 19:06:39 What's the evidence/proof Trump is owned by Putin?

Trump was ...

- rich
- famous
- had a great family

... BEFORE he became @POTUS

Also, both Putin & Trump want to export ...

- arms
- oil
- influence

... so Putin has NO MOTIVE to help Trump

Got any?
2457 2018-08-21 19:06:37 The article attributes growth of oil demand to plastics, not as source of energy.  Big difference in emissions.
2458 2018-08-21 19:06:35 Great so youve still got another 13bn to find, cause last year oil rev was 0
2459 2018-08-21 19:06:30 Doesn't Jif make an organic peanut butter? And if by "organic" you mean the junk with the oil on top, yeah, that's nasty.

2464 2018-08-21 19:05:59 Any plan that promotes coal, oil and gas; over solar, wind, sterling, geothermal and hydro is not progressive and doesn’t persevere environmental protections. Also, your last two bullet points were contradictory.
2465 2018-08-21 19:05:53 Oil pipelines, drilling at the shores and coal. Sure will be great. Suggest that when /if you go to Paris. We will have a great laugh

2467 2018-08-21 19:05:37 Hi Kim, nice to see you. looks like you two are having fun up there.  I just hope thats not another one of his weird schemes. On the other hand, if you've discovered oil and thats your pipeline, don't forget your old pal Nadya.

2471 2018-08-21 19:05:13 Can't put anything in the boot. It's full of damp towels, empty jugs of oil, some random off-cuts of wood, an ancient tin of creosote, a washing up bowl full of rusty old tools and a Gunson Colortune.
2472 2018-08-21 19:05:09 or try using oil serums!!! argan oil is good one, jojoba oil is great for dry skin, peach seed oil as well :)
2473 2018-08-21 19:05:04 The medical community is trying to get rid of coconut oil because it works, just like they got rid of the natural remedies that killed cancer.  Shocked! Not.

2477 2018-08-21 19:04:39 Big Oil has known about Global Warming for decades yet funded propaganda & lies to dupe public into believing Climate Change is a hoax. It's no wonder people are so ignorant as to vote for Trump. Pacific Northwest is choking because of predicted fires. #FossilFuelFascsim #SiegOil
2478 2018-08-21 19:04:36 And there lies in the conundrum?

Oil and water doesn't mix.
2479 2018-08-21 19:04:13 If you mean oil wealth more literally, that's only Norway, and Norway was a welfare state before it even had any oil

2481 2018-08-21 19:04:05 Back in June UP Babaylan created a fuss over who really initiated the first Philippine Pride March, they claimed that it was them and not ProGay and MCCQC that did, saying that the 1994 event shouldn't be considered a Pride March as it raised national issues like oil price hike
2482 2018-08-21 19:03:57 I was raised in a normal blue collar southern baptist household right outside Detroit--you know nothing about me & are making HUGE assumptions! I've have been with the same guy for 32yrs & married 25 so YES! I'm a huge radical. I'm the most stable & old fashion of all my friends
2483 2018-08-21 19:03:48 I’ve been using Castor oil or Castor oil and coconut oil depending on my mood and once it is all soaked in it is soooo smooth and even

2486 2018-08-21 19:03:19 None of the options you present address the primary use of oil, for transportation. The reason we are having a problem getting off oil is that we don't have any mass-market options for most of our daily transportation requirements, rail, trucks, trains, planes and family vehicles
2487 2018-08-21 19:03:09 I remember doing an interview years ago about the whole paper vs plastic scheme. Society got duped by Big Oil under the guise of the environment. #plasticis4ever

2498 2018-08-21 19:02:05 The Iranian masters the technology and can count on his engineers ; his future is IN HIS HANDS. The Saudi can buy the technology produced by his masters, as long as the oil is there. But in 10 years ?...
I'm sure you can understand this evidence.

Have you heard of Project Prism. NSA & Social media tycoons coming together.
Exxon, see their lobbying for Iraq war
2505 2018-08-21 19:01:11 I see you went on a tangent with you last tweet. Was it because you wanted to deflect my point that science is still not settled? If it was they would have known about the Antarctic waters. 

P.S it's just snowed in Saudi Arabia. The home of oil.
2506 2018-08-21 19:00:55 So get out of the countries pay for the oil you are stealing and give back the oil fields and take your nukes our of our country!
2507 2018-08-21 19:00:41 Anytime I use a face oil I get a drop on the front of my shirt. So I do it without a shirt for a while. Then I get confident. Then I get oil on another shirt.

2521 2018-08-21 18:59:48 Youre not too sharp

Read the last paragraph 

"Including north sea oil"

Now what ?
2522 2018-08-21 18:59:45 The current batch of THC oil is made form our Galiano (Northern Lights Haze) strain, it's made from several batches and therefore labeled as a "blend". We are amending the website to hopefully avoid any confusion in the future!
2523 2018-08-21 18:59:34 Cool--it's my day off so I'll see you later.  Have a great day! :)
2524 2018-08-21 18:59:26 Online then okay. If it's marvel based hate it really isn't because of you. It's the direction they took. Your magneto and Dark Phoenix look nice.  Hell,  that oil painting looks cool af. The cupcake warrior looks like it should be a little children's cartoon.
2525 2018-08-21 18:59:22 I would say 4 intercontinental round trips / ha / a...not including the reductions from fossil fuel use (2-4 t fuel oil ekv / a)
2526 2018-08-21 18:59:03 Just pray over yourself anoint your head with oil anoint your wherever the pain is at and pray don't you know you can heal your yourself through by laying your hands on yourself and you shall be healed in the name of Jesus Christ
2527 2018-08-21 18:59:03 How about stuff like Oil money, constituency allowance, Up NEPA, inconclusive, medical trip, committee, convoy, appointment etc, let there be a strong massage to be conveyed, that's Hiphop.
2528 2018-08-21 18:58:51 So... doing what is essentially equivalent to drinking a bottle of cannabis essential oil causes problems....

...go figure...
2529 2018-08-21 18:58:41 and they're planning something right now.  I suspect the Moscow Mules were on an "oil excavating" trip, i.e., Keystone Pipeline.  Saudi Arabia, Iran & Russia are all about oil, too.
2530 2018-08-21 18:58:14 Coffee. MCT Oil. Cocoa butter and Cocoa powder all blended up together.
This is how we survive
2531 2018-08-21 18:58:12 Unless your going to be more specific I'm going to assume you're experiencing the 1st stages of dementia (like Trump)
2532 2018-08-21 18:58:12 Why are gas prices continuing to rise? Do we export most of the oil we use? The mid west oil line should be close to drilling oil.  We have too many oil drilling places in the US to pay exorbitant prices as we have been doing.  Tax cut goes right into paying for gas!!
2533 2018-08-21 18:58:10 the article read "trump supporters" not Atlanta but your kin folk did all they could with just L'l Abner comics around to teach you

2538 2018-08-21 18:57:39 Every site I've seen tells me to use coconut oil for every health benefit I want.

2545 2018-08-21 18:56:45 @dougtrattner Is there anywhere in town that has "dry" Asian noodles on the menu? I think they're sometimes called "scallion oil noodles?"
2546 2018-08-21 18:56:44 Saudi monarch receives protection from the US like the 'last Shah of Iran'

The US doesn't care, so long as weapons and oil flows, and the region is accepting of Israel's policies. Divide and conquer
2547 2018-08-21 18:56:37 Norway was also a welfare state long before it had any oil wealth
2548 2018-08-21 18:56:32 How come when the price of a barrel of crude oil was $100 the price of petrol was £1 per litre. It's now $68 A barrel and the price if petrol is £1.30 A litre. How does that work? Yet you pay your staff over inflated wages which everyday working people only dream of??
2549 2018-08-21 18:56:19 Cheers. In related news, take a look at that fresh CNCDA data on California sales. As I suggested in Oil Fall, it becomes more difficult to see how ICE light vehicle sales can ever return to growth, in CA. That's just extraordinary to see coming into view, already in 2018.
2550 2018-08-21 18:56:05 Then why put his beloved kids in a barrel of crude oil? This is a disgusting attempt to get away with his disgusting crime!
2551 2018-08-21 18:55:52 K.Abassi gave 250 KM white oil pipeline contract to a Chinese company on BOO basis at rates 5×Tariffs compared to International Tariffs. Enquiry/investigation needed. Must be CPEC project. All CPEC projects constructed at high capital cost. No gurantee of quality & life span ???
2552 2018-08-21 18:55:47 Roses are red

2553 2018-08-21 18:55:40 @virtualash There's no such thing as an ethical oil company.
2554 2018-08-21 18:55:40 Lots and lots of oil
2555 2018-08-21 18:55:18 Bio oil
2556 2018-08-21 18:55:14 Daaaamn that sucks... hope that doesn't extend to coconut oil, which a lot of sweets use.
2557 2018-08-21 18:55:06 A bunch of pedophiles, crooks, and snake oil salesmen took over the fundamentalist Christians. They followed them like lambs believing all the bullshit while their leaders lined their pockets and pronounced their hate to all who’d listen.
2558 2018-08-21 18:55:05 Socialism is the equal distribution of poverty and misery. Venezuela; the largest oil reserves in the world and a socialist government has bankrupt the country, AGAIN. Supermarket sheleves are empty. The population is fleeing to neighbourong states for food — NEVER VOTE #LABOUR
2559 2018-08-21 18:55:02 I don't even own pants/shorts so this is a HUGE problem even though I'm not a plus size gal. My advice is to find a cream, oil or powder that works for you, never leave your home without it. Find clothing that doesn't make your thighs sweaty - a flowy or short dress works for me.
2560 2018-08-21 18:55:00 Respect ain't earned twice, once you lose it it's gone
2561 2018-08-21 18:55:00 Total Energy & Oil Company withdrew from a $4.6 Billion project with Iran to avoid sanctions from US.......
2562 2018-08-21 18:54:56 Good Luck to @postmalone and crew, landing a G4 with a belly slide will not be a fun experience. #PostMalone
2563 2018-08-21 18:54:50 They also used the fat/oil, and ate the meat after sacrifice. Yes 100% agree these animals enjoy torture and killing inhumanely.
2564 2018-08-21 18:54:50 And Canada buys oil from them—-why?  Nothing like unethical oil.
2565 2018-08-21 18:54:49 ¶ He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich. -Proverbs 21:17 KJV
2566 2018-08-21 18:54:44 UPA growth despite record high crude oil price and global economic meltdown. NDA slump despite record low Crude prices and booming global economy!
2567 2018-08-21 18:54:39 Switching to an all natural one will help with product build up and soak up more oil!
2568 2018-08-21 18:54:38 Many thanks as always to #WarrsSouthEast #HarleyDavidson in Mottingham UK.
New hydraulic cam tensioners & oil pump - Great value (actually came in well under quote due to not having to remove my pipes) and a top job as usual.
Full marks to an excellent team & dealership! 
2569 2018-08-21 18:54:26 Who knew tea tree oil soap would make you smell so good 
2570 2018-08-21 18:54:21 Ok not the beard oil...
2571 2018-08-21 18:54:14 Yes, probably best not to eat iron coated with oxidized flaxseed oil! 
2572 2018-08-21 18:54:13 Something to base. Coconut oil, sheer butter and almond oil with some rose oil for my scalp. Then mix them all together.
2573 2018-08-21 18:54:07 What an idiot !!  The female CNN anchor is just plain clueless.  Now saying, Manafort directly links the Trump and White House to Russia influence.  Stunning this low IQ anchor is allowed on TV.
2574 2018-08-21 18:54:03 Even some oil journos on here need to read it
2575 2018-08-21 18:54:01 This is why i delete facebook  seen someone really trying to say they paid $250 for a oil change on something that ain’t even a foreign  then had the nerves to say they pops was a mechanic for 30 plus years.
2576 2018-08-21 18:53:43 UPA growth despite record high crude oil price and global economic meltdown.
NDA slump despite record low Crude prices and booming global economy!
2577 2018-08-21 18:53:36 This wet hair look was thing in the 90s as I remember. Its disgusting. They usually use baby oil to achieve this look.
2578 2018-08-21 18:53:35 One of the reasons the country is poor our leaders can't think outside oil, imagine the foreign visitors this place would attract if it is well managed.
2579 2018-08-21 18:53:34 Could it be that unending civil war in Africa is being Sponsored by the Westerns for their own gains? Gold in Congo,Oil in Libya among others.
2580 2018-08-21 18:53:18 Took my car in for an oil change in my @taylorswift13 shirt. They got a kick out of my Taylor Swift keychain and air freshener. Apparently it was obvious I’m a fan? 
2581 2018-08-21 18:53:13 Just paid for my oil change and groceries.. shit hurt lol adulting at its finest
2582 2018-08-21 18:53:09 didn't the U.S. expand social democracy during the New Deal somewhat without a lot of oil wealth? Why are you buying into a conservative meme?
2583 2018-08-21 18:53:02 nobody will ever Elect that sneering Weasel Leader ,we dont do Snake Oil Salesmen 
2584 2018-08-21 18:52:58 Yep those libs I can only take so Much so I Blocked her. 
2585 2018-08-21 18:52:47 just you drink tis here oil of the snake
2586 2018-08-21 18:52:46 They are very expensive. I have hairspray I make with olive oil water, some citronella eucalyptus n lavender oil. Add a bit of my fav conditioner to the bottle mix it all together in a spray bottle.
2587 2018-08-21 18:52:41 Why do I keep reading the dish as “Punchy Jerk Face”?
2588 2018-08-21 18:52:41 Hello! I could use the oil on my nose as lip gloss. I just carry blotting paper now. Since it’s going to happen regardless.
2589 2018-08-21 18:52:40 Jacson Alexander (@jzander_2) on the trade to the @EdmOilKings: 
“I’m very excited to join the Edmonton Oil Kings and I’m looking forward to the season. It was an unforgettable season with the Broncos. I will miss the town and the guys a lot.”
2590 2018-08-21 18:52:38 Good God... can you imagine? SWOLE Oil King Legs™? 

Chun-Li will weep with joy~ 
2591 2018-08-21 18:52:31 This is my first time making oil down and no lie it’s lit 
2592 2018-08-21 18:52:26 Buy one more too for my empty seat
2593 2018-08-21 18:52:20 Het klinkt als én is hoogstwaarschijnlijk snake oil. Met een erger effect: *al* je data door VPN jagen ipv enkel de stukjes waar ads aan knagen. 
2594 2018-08-21 18:52:18 so according to the interview, oil said they wanted to get into the mainstream with TTS and they were trying different things with Sempiternal, so I'm guessing this one is gonna be a mixture of them both and i am so fucking down for that like yes please
2595 2018-08-21 18:52:01 Rescind the clean air and water acts, without first replacing them.  Because who needs clean air and water so long as oil and coal companies get rich!  Congress needs to act NOW to protect our environment.  But I know that goes against your grain.
BTW...Flint, MI has no clean H2O
2596 2018-08-21 18:51:44 If you think they're any less a cult than Xtians are then I feel very sorry for you
The military as far as I know helps all Americans-not just the ones they cherry pick to help because they agree on some religious or political issues-that's not how it works but GOP don't get that
2597 2018-08-21 18:51:20 Wow - we have oil extracted from the North Sea worth £37.3bn, allocated, not to Scotland, but to an "unknown region". 
Thats GERS for you.
The above is from a common weal article
2598 2018-08-21 18:51:18 You misunderstood.  It's not oil wealth in the sense of "sits under their countries" but oil wealth in the sense of "oil energy makes modern social democratic life possible".
2599 2018-08-21 18:51:11 i dont drink either but we can partake in some thc oil. lol
2600 2018-08-21 18:51:07 Coconut oil coffee is everything!
2601 2018-08-21 18:51:01 The audacity of car shops. Go in for a oil change and they just assume u got $1200 to get everything else fixed
2602 2018-08-21 18:50:57 Please get off my twitter feed until you withdraw stock holdings in UK on shore unconventional oil drilling companies such as UKOG, Polluting our homes by burning up to 10 tonnes of 'waste' gas each day. 12 earthquakes in Surrey within 2 years of acid flow testing.
2603 2018-08-21 18:50:43 ur face is prob dehydrated and is overproducing sebum aka oil to moisturize itself

2605 2018-08-21 18:50:20 Shit, the wait time at the dmv next town over is basically nothing, I wonder if I can change the oil in my car and get there fast enough before the wait time gets jacked up 
2606 2018-08-21 18:50:17 Oil prices finish higher ahead of weekly data on U.S. petroleum supplies
2607 2018-08-21 18:50:15 just a tip for my thick haired girls who struggle with dryness and frizz: a combination of coconut oil and argan oil left of dry hair overnight then washed out in the morning is THE BOMB
2608 2018-08-21 18:50:14 Or when you try to place the interests of the oil & gas lobby above those of surface owners who spent years negotiating a conservation easement that opens access to 15,000 acres of private land & 5,000 acres of public land. #mtpol #mtsen #Gasbag
2609 2018-08-21 18:50:05 They'll be terribly short of water and electricity and oil and ...

I don't think these assholes understand that Scotland has a trade SURPLUS while England has a DEFICIT. Scotland isn't the one in trouble in this scenario.
2610 2018-08-21 18:49:59 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
2611 2018-08-21 18:49:59 Amazing how She recovered,remember seeing those early tweets about her with her diareah and if I remember correctly wasn't She also covered in oil?
2612 2018-08-21 18:49:51 Literally "rotten to the core" then... Maybe it might be better if states took matters in their own hands.
EU caved on Iranian oil. Will stop all purchases. No backbone in Brussels. Only the Chinese have given Trump & Co the middle .
2613 2018-08-21 18:49:42 on the other hand, commodities as a group is rather cheap (maybe apart from oil), I mean, look at silver, soybean, gold, sugar etc....

it is not paying dividend, generating cash flows etc. but still I would take a bet that silver will go up by at least 10% within 12 months...
2614 2018-08-21 18:49:33 My ancestors used to kill whales for oil then the fossil fuel industry came and took them out of business. My ancestors didn't fight to bring whaling back they learned new skills and changed with the times... Paul Ryan is a fucking idiot if he thinks Obama regulations ruined oil
2615 2018-08-21 18:49:29 Hey, it may look weird, but it's a helluva lot easier than lying on your back on a cold concrete floor with dirt and oil falling in your face! 
2616 2018-08-21 18:49:23 Not oil!
2617 2018-08-21 18:49:17 i’m getting my oil changed and i didn’t realize my phone was still connected to my bluetooth and my music was never paused so they’ve been listening to my jams this whole time if my radio is still on
2618 2018-08-21 18:49:13 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
2619 2018-08-21 18:49:09 Lmaoo my papa do my oil changes I’m glad
2620 2018-08-21 18:49:01 This guy that killed his wife and kids and stuffed their little bodies in oil tanks is now claiming his dead wife did it.  Yeah....That’s why he hid the bodies and lied about what happened.  Cuz he’s innocent.
2621 2018-08-21 18:48:59 In fact Turks were buying ISIS' oil extracted from wells on the land their seized, if you recall.
2622 2018-08-21 18:48:44 Yea and dumped them in oil bin at his employment
2623 2018-08-21 18:48:42 Chu olive oil ?
2624 2018-08-21 18:48:41 the girls were submerged for 4 days in crude oil. he had to have killed them before her. but it makes it a lot easier to have an affair w no kids
2625 2018-08-21 18:48:39 Manbun is more objectionable. I presume he Carries a Murse as well. Hate to see anyone crash though. Hope they make it.
2626 2018-08-21 18:48:33 Michael Cohen surrenders to @FBI oh man @realDonaldTrump is @CNN rocking now! Perhaps give #thetruthisnothetruth @RudyGiuliani an oil change before @ChrisCuomo tonight?  DJ do you think this will be a twofer or BOGOF with Manafort surrendering also?
2627 2018-08-21 18:48:32 Venezuela was once the richest country in Latin America with the largest oil reserves in the world. Bad leadership.
2628 2018-08-21 18:48:31 Definitely changing my oil myself next time lol I did it for the convenience this time around but for the money I spend I can easily get the good stuff~
2629 2018-08-21 18:48:30 New from Shelby county: New Oil - Chocolate Mint OG. Cuvee Pre rolls back in stock! Suppositories back in stock!
2630 2018-08-21 18:48:26 there's even a waste oil bin in the background of that picture for @lakes_bins consideration
2631 2018-08-21 18:48:24 Try amarostile (roosterbrood) for something without cooking oil. 
There's no gwinya without cooking oil ngeshwa.
2632 2018-08-21 18:48:13 I’ll take that as a compliment thank you
2633 2018-08-21 18:48:13 Lolol!  Not until loooooong after we run out of oil!  And...without the sun, if we are still here, we will all die.
2634 2018-08-21 18:48:11 Ahhh nti aku invest kat company oil n gas ok  #Sendu
2635 2018-08-21 18:48:01 Support her like you and @JustinTrudeau continue to support Saudi Arabia by buying their oil, even though they are about to behead a female activist? Build pipelines and allow for Canada’s energy independence! #SupportCanada
2636 2018-08-21 18:47:43 Yeah, cos oil is religion for the US

2642 2018-08-21 18:47:20 Thanks for the name calling--I'm 52-NOT a little girl & not drawing SS! I'm also not rude but I find Trumpers usually are & you've both proven that point. Rude to me & lying about fellow American citizens.  You both are both as lovely as our POTUS!
2643 2018-08-21 18:47:12 悲報　ねおち
2644 2018-08-21 18:47:11 Yes.  And Beto O’Rourke’s Senate campaign would be more sincere if he was against oil and gas use.  Instead he just has a position of being against hydraulic fracking.
2645 2018-08-21 18:47:08 @YeleSowore promised a minimum wage of #100k if elected President 2019. I ask , Did he ever read about the story of Yakubu Gowon and Jerome Udorji?

They shared Nigeria's excess crude oil earnings and if caused high inflation. And Sowore has no knowledge of this. Sad
@Maxiyke
2646 2018-08-21 18:46:58 You should take some of those brain pills you love to sell cough (snake oil salesmen) cough.
Also cut back on salt water, it isn't good for you.
2647 2018-08-21 18:46:33 In need of a good cuticle oil.
2648 2018-08-21 18:46:30 How? More coal and oil shit? Fuck you allYou don’t get to do this much longerYoufucks deliberately keep us in the dark The light is returned
2649 2018-08-21 18:46:23 Sure let’s push for more dusty dirty coal. Let the coal companies use our streams & waterways to dump their garbage in polluting our streams. Let’s pump oil out of the Gulf of Mexico & our oceans so we can have another Deep Water Horizon killing fish& birds.
2650 2018-08-21 18:46:18 Yep 
2651 2018-08-21 18:46:08 Ban coconuts!! The devils oil !!

2654 2018-08-21 18:46:01 I haven't paid for gasoline for over 5 years. With solar PV, I haven't paid for electricity either.  Junk? Lol, no.

But you can remain a serf to utilities & oil barons if you want to.

2657 2018-08-21 18:45:44 @realDonaldTrump 
Oh oh, @MichaelCohen212 is taking a deal. 
Plastic bags and olive oil are so useful in prison, you’ll find out soon enough you POS.
2658 2018-08-21 18:44:50 ATTENTION POLITICIANS (especially Oklahoma politicians #okleg) - STOP using the disingenuous and intellectually insulting phrase "WINNERS AND LOSERS" when discussing energy and labor policy.

Ask your local whale oil merchant how to best stop progress and ignore social duty.
2659 2018-08-21 18:44:40 The dunked burger looks like it was dunked in oil 
2660 2018-08-21 18:44:30 I think you’re right libs always think they are right I would love for them to stand on the front lines & see if they just talk lol they will be down in no time. America didn’t get strong with just talking 
2661 2018-08-21 18:44:25 #ANGS Would be disappointed not to see 15p - 20p range as low free float - oil in place - further licences for production - Bergan out - AIM liquidity improved with Beaufort client money back in the market + Q4 always the best part of the year as per last year - GL
2662 2018-08-21 18:44:24 Oh and the corn and a bit of vegetable oil. The oil makes them just slide out of the shell...love it.
2663 2018-08-21 18:44:18 I went deeper into your ig. Why don't you do comicbook covers? Your oil painting and drawings are good! It would be cool to see your art style on a cover like Ghost Rider in oil paint or Spider-Man or even Wolverine.  You should make a submission.

2671 2018-08-21 18:43:25 Those kohlers burn oil like crazy. Just check them daily.
2672 2018-08-21 18:43:25 However, it doesn’t work for everyone! My point is, the problem is bigger than a pipeline. Look up how much electricity is still generated with obsolete tech. Isn’t that a starting point. Most of our cars currently still rely on oil.
2673 2018-08-21 18:43:13 His trade war is causing oil and natural gas to panic, so if anything he is trying to offset mistakes with more mistakes and it's all really pathetic #IdontwatchMSNBC
2674 2018-08-21 18:43:11 Check your oil.
Of the ten virgins 5 were wise and five foolish.  When the bridegroom came the wise trimmed their lamps and were ready.  The foolish were out of oil and missed his arrival.
Keep checking your oil level.
He is coming soon.
2675 2018-08-21 18:43:07 Never looked. Just mix in a bowl equal measures of couscous and boiling water, with tbsp of olive oil. Cover and leave go 2-3 minutes. Stir it all up with a fork, and serve. There you go......

2682 2018-08-21 18:41:41 Scientific proofs abound in support of the deadly effect of smoke & pollution caused by coal & oil...also slowing down building blocks already laid down toward cleaner air in all areas of life: like cars to 100mpg, 50% solar energy source in ten years, etc,...all  these junked???
2683 2018-08-21 18:41:40 Where can I find the oil at?
2684 2018-08-21 18:41:18 Step away from the plastic in your computer or phone...some of that oil is used in the production of those products. 

Stop trying to suck and blow through the straw at the same time.

2686 2018-08-21 18:41:09 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
2687 2018-08-21 18:41:08 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2688 2018-08-21 18:40:40 Someone change my oil pweaseeee

2690 2018-08-21 18:40:09 for real: when the Donald has a toddler tantrum, Mitch Mcconnell dies a slow emotional death
2691 2018-08-21 18:40:09 Endless oil story
2692 2018-08-21 18:40:08 Keep you some lavender oil. Run it on your temples and behind your ears
2693 2018-08-21 18:39:53 I’m sorry but that is ugly. She’s way way too thin and she doesn’t have a single curve. Bad lighting and shadows and the hit or miss oil is disgusting
2694 2018-08-21 18:39:52 ..have they "attacked our country thru history" ? I'd really love some examples since you're such an expert (& our country has never been attacked!) Do tell, please!
2695 2018-08-21 18:39:51 @foundmyfitness what are your thoughts on the “coconut oil is pure poison” lecture that has been in the news?
2696 2018-08-21 18:39:34 i like the nars oil and shine primer too
2697 2018-08-21 18:39:27 I’m currently full of CBD oil infused coffee and I’m happy
2698 2018-08-21 18:39:13 If you suffer from inflammatory issues, anxiety, or migraines you should look into CBD oil or a pen. It really works
2699 2018-08-21 18:39:06 I rarely use primers that are mattifying bI cause my foundation is always a matte formula. Matte on matte on matte = excessive oil production. No sir, no ma’am.
2700 2018-08-21 18:39:05 Doesn’t work for me either. If anything it makes my under eye concealer ball up and flake. I hate it. I’ll occasionally do a light dusting on my cheeks but that’s it. Not the best oil control method imo. Becca and the Skindinavia setting spray mixed with foundation >>>>
2701 2018-08-21 18:39:01 Olive oil >>>>>>>
2702 2018-08-21 18:38:54 Aces. Does the oil matter?
2703 2018-08-21 18:38:53 One of them slicked his fingers in oil and shoved them up Alvo’s ass.
2704 2018-08-21 18:38:48 I had that happen to me too and REFUSED to remove and let close. I found tea tree oil was way way too harsh and putting actual sea salt on the bump at points to get it to shrink.
2705 2018-08-21 18:38:45 Liberals have no sense of humor. We're not angry as we make fun of them and they call it hate speech because they're the angry ones.
2706 2018-08-21 18:38:42 "People pray for the cake. Then God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, pan, an oven, they get frustrated and leave the kitchen." Let that sink in. Sometimes you have everything right in front of you,  but how bad do you want it?
2707 2018-08-21 18:38:38 same !!! when i first tried olives i thought my mum was pulling a prank on me, it was like. inedible and also tasted nothing like olive oil??? and i have a condition that Makes me crave salt so u know its bad
2708 2018-08-21 18:38:34 oil paints are better for textures. acrylics are better for shades and hues and tones.
2709 2018-08-21 18:38:32 If they don’t like dirty Alberta oil, maybe oil revenue should be excluded for the equalization formula like Quebec hydro is
2710 2018-08-21 18:38:12 Just changed my oil, getting my window fixed Friday, but that transmission is TBD!!!!!!
2711 2018-08-21 18:37:59 Got up early feeling not groggy, went and got the oil changed in my car, went grocery shopping, and about to take out trash and put away dishes. Feeling oddly productive for once, on a day off at that

2715 2018-08-21 18:37:43 Is this the same ‘president’ that is mining ‘clean’ coal and drilling for oil in national parks...? #hypocrite
2716 2018-08-21 18:37:39 Two hour wait for my oil to get changed, someone come save me pls
2717 2018-08-21 18:37:32 Starting today we gonna KILL IT with water consumption. I found an article that said dehydration is a leading cause of acne due to an uneven balance of oil/water in the skin. Maybe someday I can have clear skin if I start drinking 10,000 gallons a day, let’s find out !!
2718 2018-08-21 18:37:29 Economy under Trump has helped the poor, minorities, transgenders, the sick,as well as most Democrats NATO and the EU needed a reality check. NATO now contribute about 50 billion dollars more. That EU&Mexico are dropping most of their unfair tariffs. China caved on 25% oil tariff
2719 2018-08-21 18:37:28 How old am I?! I could ask the same of you as you're my elder & calling American citizens "enemies" because of the religion they practice. Are you judging this entire group based on the actions of a few that reside overseas? Who told you they were enemies of America? Trump? How..
2720 2018-08-21 18:37:16 FOR REAL omg olive oil adds so much flavor but i cannot stand olives
2721 2018-08-21 18:37:12 Okay ladies I’ve been using Tarte Maracuja oil on my face before my foundation and idk wtf kind of magic this is but I had a few pimples on my forehead and on my chin and they’re gone 
2722 2018-08-21 18:37:09 It has to be conditioner but I also love hot oil treatments too xx
2723 2018-08-21 18:37:08 Some "pre mid-term" oil!
2724 2018-08-21 18:37:02 I’m so tempted to buy this oil painting of a couple capybaras drinking martinis
2725 2018-08-21 18:36:46 Use oil to stop it from turning into grass
2726 2018-08-21 18:36:44 how come olive oil so good and olives just. lil balls o' salt
2727 2018-08-21 18:36:27 so people should stop journalism and opt for watching toxicity of @FoxNews ?
2728 2018-08-21 18:36:24 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
2729 2018-08-21 18:36:21 A $10 oil change? How can I not?
2730 2018-08-21 18:36:14 Exactly! They want to implement a gold/yuan oil desk if memory serves.
2731 2018-08-21 18:36:08 I think so too. Don't think Scots realise how dirty WM will get once we go indy. Suspect we'll need to give them some of our oil fields in the negotiations. At the least, that'll stop them invading us in the future for oil. We can't let the thought of their anarchy stop us tho.
2732 2018-08-21 18:36:06 Yes, but how many to Russian oil billionaires???
2733 2018-08-21 18:36:01 Yup, whatever you think. Let’s see, do you get that owning a hybrid where electricity is generated via coal or oil versus hydro electric is going to have different environmental impacts? Do you drive a vehicle? What does it run on?
2734 2018-08-21 18:35:46 If you want embolden the Republican Guard then keep ratcheting up the sanctions regime. Trump is doing exactly what his boss tells him, tightening oil and gas supplies so prices rise for the world's largest supplier Russia
2735 2018-08-21 18:35:42 Really? Have you looked around the world lately and come to the conclusion oil isn't our enemy. Fine if he's the only democrat but Obama didn't need to cheerlead for him if that's the case.
2736 2018-08-21 18:35:37 Honey.
Today is car maintenance.
I changed the battery and the oil clean.
run again.
In better condition.
Goodnight and I loveyou.

2739 2018-08-21 18:35:19 Let’s fry chicken wings this weekend I got the chicken and the peanut oil lol
2740 2018-08-21 18:35:14 Ya so basically they don’t wage wars with anyone & use the oil money to spread the wealth to their population making them happy healthy and educated. As opposed to US which keeps its population uneducated poor obese spends trillions on wars and all the oil money goes to 1% of ppl

2745 2018-08-21 18:34:57 STFU big oil destroying our environment
2746 2018-08-21 18:34:46 Nope. A doughnut is cooked in oil, in memory of the oil in the candelabra in the temple in Jerusalem that the Assyrians defiled, requiring the quest for new oil, and the miracle, etc.
2747 2018-08-21 18:34:28 My brother keeps his swords coated with a thin layer of oil and I’ve only ever seen the ones he didn’t coat start to rust.

Grain of salt on this however as he polishes them quarterly.

2753 2018-08-21 18:33:54 Sorry! Coconut oil, bicarbonate of soda, xylitol and peppermint oil. Still trying to decide if it's a problem that there's no flouride in it.
2754 2018-08-21 18:33:46 Well, because these rich people working in the oil/coal/fossil resources industry often only care about their own business and will do everything to fight against what threatens it. In this case, everything linked to climate change, which leads to skepticism among people.
2755 2018-08-21 18:33:43 How about they ask if any old energy company (oil, coal) is paying them?
2756 2018-08-21 18:33:42 coal pollution affects the next generation and everyone has offsprings - some don’t care about those I suppose.
2757 2018-08-21 18:33:39 I spent way too much oil trying to grind for the Kaga/Akagi pair zzz, and I only have one still, time to spend another 3-4 days grinding and hoping to RNG for the other ksjdskjd
2758 2018-08-21 18:33:24 Apparently the fallback arg here is that actually it’s that the modern economy is based off oil or other power sources we now know as harmful. Sounds like it’s back to the drawing board for all of socialism if that’s the concern.
2759 2018-08-21 18:33:19 it’s all snake oil
2760 2018-08-21 18:33:08 اجي اساعدك؟
2761 2018-08-21 18:33:04 Piss of wheeler. Just keep wheeling and dealing with coal and oil industry. Be a complete failure at your job. Your decisions now will have a price to pay later. The green energy wave is here to stay. Global warming is real.
2762 2018-08-21 18:33:04 kanada, emptied of its minerals and dirty oil. emptied of its trees and water. a crippled thing, drowning in a puddle, covered in ants. the ocean doesn’t give a shit because it knows it’s dying too.

2765 2018-08-21 18:32:10 Desperate = Dangerous,,if scots are not in EU WM wont care about making enemies of scots to keep the resources. They went to illegal war for oil in Iraq,and much as I`d like to think westminster will accept scots choice on the chin, and remain friendly,I fear they will not!

2770 2018-08-21 18:31:34 because we were supporting Israel in the six day war an oil embargo kicked in and that basically dropped the economy by 15% and the balance of payments never recovered in that period of power.
2771 2018-08-21 18:31:33 Good to know, I had wondered. My daughter loves oil pastels.
2772 2018-08-21 18:31:22 You draw the line at the white man attacking coconut oil???  I’m shook
2773 2018-08-21 18:31:20 As long as you stumbled onto more GOPBS - remember how Obama was called anti-oil, anti-drilling and all that?
Under OBAMA/oil and gas: *Record US production *Record LOW imports *US now an EXPORTER.
Record HIGH gas price?
July 2008 $4.11 under BUSH THE OIL MAN
So much for that BS.

2801 2018-08-21 18:27:32 The 1973 Oil Crisis drove gas prices from $.50 a gallon to over $4.00
The rate of inflation from then to now is $1.00 in 1973 equals $5.68 in 2018
Are you willing to pay over $20.00 a gallon to drive your automobile?
That's economics 101 and you can always count on another crisis

2809 2018-08-21 18:26:08 The big oil companies don't want you to declare all of their problems and they do pay big money for accurate solutions. It's a business.

2817 2018-08-21 18:24:19 Ohhh Crude Oil prices are decided by @RahulGandhi and @INCIndia ...
2818 2018-08-21 18:24:08 why do you give this disgraced snake oil salesman #WhiteSupremacist air time? what has he done to deserve this role? #tuesdaythoughts

2819 2018-08-21 18:23:42 Probably LATE. Buttttt Washing my face with coconut oil has been wonderful 
2820 2018-08-21 18:23:28 3 minutes in the waiting room getting my oil changed and I might lose it. 

This lady keeps smacking and popping her gum. 

Plz stop.
2821 2018-08-21 18:23:26 @AmyTrask Getting oil changed @goodyear & UR on @CBSSportsNet w/ @AdamSchein describing Khalil Mack & @Raiders situation as “perplexing.” Hi
2822 2018-08-21 18:23:21 Bruising should still show something depending on level of decomp. Oil would theoretically retard oxygen and insect activity
2823 2018-08-21 18:23:05 having a car is fun until I have buy new tires, get it inspected & registered, and a oil change
2824 2018-08-21 18:22:48 Carl listen to Springsteen Glory Days on loop?
2825 2018-08-21 18:22:40 ME:hey bro can I ask you a question.                                          BROTHER: yes go for it                ME: I corn oil is made from corn and vegetable oil is made from. Vegetables then what is baby oil made of.           BROTHER: *gasps* babies

2828 2018-08-21 18:22:17 I tend to think that the only substantial differences between Saudi Arabia and ISIS are:

- Saudis don't make propaganda out of their atrocities
- Saudis never aim their atrocities to the West
- Saudis have plenty of oil
2829 2018-08-21 18:22:17 Yeah imagine having to pay for an oil change with auto insurance.....
2830 2018-08-21 18:22:13 Enjoying the annual August in Vancouver?  Well it was made shitty by Alberta and Ottawa's oil industry which needs to be completely shut down. #pipelines #bcseparates
2831 2018-08-21 18:22:09 Don't agree, it was FOMO for a large part but when investment funds come in to buy I think most order books will be whiped.

And then we have potential of commodities like oil being bought/sold through #xrp

Derivatives, FX etc etc.. you get where I am going at 
2832 2018-08-21 18:22:03 trying to read this short story for class while my oil is getting changed and i just can’t

2834 2018-08-21 18:21:32 1st thing they need is a deep liquid Brent contract in € in Fkfurt or Paris. EZ is as big an oil importer as CN, the world’s largest savings exporter (current flows), it has 4 oil majors, & world’s most internationally active banking system. They’re just not using this stuff.
2835 2018-08-21 18:21:27 I need to balance my chakras. I need to do a parasite cleanse. I need to get a facial. I need a deep conditioning and hot oil treatment. I need to get a deluxe mani/pedi. I need a full body massage. I need to soak in Epsom salt for an hour. I need to get my teeth whitened. Yes.
2836 2018-08-21 18:21:22 2nd oil change in 4 months.. I bend some corners man
2837 2018-08-21 18:20:58 Electric oil diffusers back in stock!
2838 2018-08-21 18:20:41 Nope!!! That’s the magic worker  before the marula oil, my face was just aaiighht. I’ve been using it for about 7 months now. And my face still wakes up plumped and ready for makeup every morning!!
2839 2018-08-21 18:20:38 Canada's been our best ally for generations. In response, Trump has been a total jackass to them. You may not know that because I don't think Mr. D'Souza has written about it. But when Fox reports on an oil pipeline, you'll say Trudeau's the strongest leader upon the world stage.
2840 2018-08-21 18:20:32 Coconuts come from Palm Trees. Palm Oil has been listed as the worst trans fat since the mid 1980's.
2841 2018-08-21 18:20:28 It doesn’t have to be, does it? How can you explain this: Saudi Arabia is the best ally of US and they are a Muslim state even bearing statements of Islam on their flag?? Does it have something to do with bl00dy oil? You bet?
2842 2018-08-21 18:20:27 Then build the pipeline and STOP BUYING THEIR OIL!
2843 2018-08-21 18:20:26 This has culminated in major suppliers hoarding certain products in warehouses and selling them off at a vastly increased price on the black market, sending inflation higher and higher.
The massive drop in oil revenues is also a significant factor.
2844 2018-08-21 18:20:10 Energy ETFs worth watching:  Crude Oil  (-2x) SCO  (-3x) DWT  Heating Oil  (1x) USCF  Natural Gas  (1x) UNG  (3x) UGAZ
2845 2018-08-21 18:20:09 You can exfoliate your lips once a week by using sugar and olive oil.
2846 2018-08-21 18:20:01 How you provide the oil for your own hate train? lmao dummy.
2847 2018-08-21 18:20:01 Meanwhile, US Oil, WestRock, TARGA, PSE are massively increasing #Tacoma pollution. Many are also $$$ contributors to local dems.
It's a lot easier to blame Washington DC, while ignoring environmental degradation here & injustices against the Puyallup Tribe.

2849 2018-08-21 18:19:48 GOLD backed chinese currency cant b traded against USD.....#Venezuela recently launched oil+gold backed currency...too..world is moving away from USD...German FM claimed tht E.U needs a parallel payments systm surpassing SWIFT...
2850 2018-08-21 18:19:34 I got this weed pen but I don’t like it. Idk if it needs to charge? Is this shit really just cbd oil? Is this just a cleaner high so I don’t feel as smacked? This shit like an appetizer
2851 2018-08-21 18:19:31 You’ve inspired me - have just booked the oil painting course! It will be a good antidote to the stresses of work, doing something completely different.
2852 2018-08-21 18:19:16 LISSEN WE NEED TO RECTIFY THIS TRAVESTY. DOESN'T THE WORD SAY: "Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all." Lemme light some candles, grab my oil, and get in my closet so that you may prosper and be in good health.
2853 2018-08-21 18:19:09 Glad you're not my Grammy! She spent 6yrs as a missionary-4yrs in Africa! What are you teaching your grandbabies-to hate? To spread hate speech? Great roll model! Glad my family taught me to accept all religions & races. You must be sad people if you need to spread lies & hate!
2854 2018-08-21 18:19:07 ทุกวันนี้พยายามหาสิ่งเยียวยาจิตใจอยู่เสมอ หาเรื่องไปคอน พยายามคิดไรบันเทิงๆเวลาต้องเดินกลับบ้านคนเดียวไกลๆ การหาเวลาอันน้อยนิดเพื่อไปหาใครบางคน ถึงแม้มันอาจจะเสี่ยงที่เราจะโดนแบนแต่นั่นคือความสุข บางจังหวะชีวิตของคนเรามันก็หาความสุขได้ยากมากเลยนะ แค่นั่งนิ่งๆหายใจยังเหนื่อยเลย…

2863 2018-08-21 18:18:21 Require them to attend classes on 
1) How to spot a narcissistic, opportunistic con man/snake oil salesman
2) How to distinguish science from pseudoscience
3) How to identify conspiracy theories
4) How to use evidence to reject/debunk con men, pseudoscience & conspiracy theories.
2864 2018-08-21 18:17:57 oil leak and my ac doesn’t work, and i’m paying 60$ for them to tell me they can’t fix either 

the red revolution is coming ☭
2865 2018-08-21 18:17:52 is really hard to follow because you're using terms that don't belong. first VA is saying that demand shifts because of oil prices so the correlation is with prices not between each other. the only one that claims there is a correlation between suv and m3 was you but that's wrong
2866 2018-08-21 18:17:42 Death Throes in the Hundred Years Oil War are just these vehicles.When we see Electric Tanks on battlefields we will be further on with winning since we are a militarized society. Cars Tanks & Airplanes were successes on the battlefields ending horse calvary
2867 2018-08-21 18:17:38 I'm hoping that this new bottom board will stop the hivew beetles from getting all the way into the hive. This is #8 hardware cloth & I have a pan of oil under it. Holing the beetle will fall into the trap &  die.
2868 2018-08-21 18:17:26 Those aren’t the only two options though.
2869 2018-08-21 18:17:09 @Ford hello Ford, bought a new Fiesta about 7000 miles ago and was wondering if the free 1st oil change was a company thing or depends on the dealership? Not confident in my local dealership and would like to have the service done at a different Ford dealership.

2874 2018-08-21 18:16:44 So just did a bit of research and it turns out Angolan Oil fields are actually depleting and they need new explorations... could Diversification answer their question?
2875 2018-08-21 18:16:44 in case you think i'm getting to big for my britches, do know that i gave myself a rectangular chemical burn on my FaCe because i put way too much tea tree oil on a bandaid to help heal a zit.
2876 2018-08-21 18:16:39 Just put a few drops of any LP thc oil in any food product and bam, its an edible. Will work better than trying to infuse it directly and can control dose much more easily.
2877 2018-08-21 18:16:36 The #Waorani were extremely hostile to outsiders & to this day still have skirmishes with oil workers. But otherwise the contacted settlements are now semi-acculturated and function alongside mainstream #Ecuadorean society. #TRLT
2878 2018-08-21 18:16:35 Yes ohhhh, as per been the only President to increase their allowee even with the oil boom period could not do it.

2885 2018-08-21 18:15:29 The Marula oil is MAGIC!!!! same thing happen to me, I can’t live without it now.
2886 2018-08-21 18:15:19 Norway hides it better than Venezuela.  You been there? Oil wealth, low population, and sky high drug addiction rates. They shoot up instead of at each other.
2887 2018-08-21 18:15:18 RT @LivingSafely: Brominated vegetable oil ("BVO") in your sodas this August? This flame retardant can be used to prevent separation.
2888 2018-08-21 18:15:17 And the Portuguese tanker Nordtulip sailed past Vancouver BC with 6000000 barrels of Russia oil from Vladivostok to the American refinery at Anacortes Washington and apparently there are others doing the same, what's that about?
2889 2018-08-21 18:15:17 What happened in Colorado is insane. "She strangled the kids. I just killed her." But you threw the kids in an oil drum???
2890 2018-08-21 18:15:02 And watercolor is easily moved around with water, where as oil and water don’t mix so it’s a bit of a different process when moving paint around.
2891 2018-08-21 18:15:01 Oregano oil works wonders if you’ve never used it before
2892 2018-08-21 18:14:49 don't worry, we're gonna be running an oil pipeline through the part of the country that's on fire every year so you won't have to put up with seeing the silhouette of those mountains for long
2893 2018-08-21 18:14:36 definitely fixing the door. these ding-dongs keep ringing the bell and leaving in the same blue car and this has happened a few in the past few months. i'm going to put salt under them and possibly laventer oil above them
2894 2018-08-21 18:14:35 Try the same with olive oil. Tasty and more healthy.
2895 2018-08-21 18:14:18 cuba has practically no oil wealth

2897 2018-08-21 18:14:09 Lmao my dad & uncles work in the oil fields and sometimes I wonder if they work w/ the funny ass videos they send me
2898 2018-08-21 18:14:03 Mr place tht baby oil speaking facts
2899 2018-08-21 18:14:00 simplest answer: acrylic is a plastic based paint and oil is obvi made of oils, and takes much longer to dry, but has more body/texture than acrylics!
2900 2018-08-21 18:14:00 coconut oil can also be used for seizures/ epilepsy
2901 2018-08-21 18:13:56 Really? Dems demand spending. How do that do that in minority? No...GOP tax cuts explode deficits. They always have Reagan Bush. Same now. 

Fracking? Sure. Fracking that Obama EPA ALLOWED along w oil exports that started Jan 1 2016. Btw that was during Obama.
2902 2018-08-21 18:13:49 Hahah the market will introduce new software technology and features, but you keep selling your snake oil
2903 2018-08-21 18:13:48 “I’m just... Doing stuff.” Magnus was concentrating, not really knowing what to say. He took a bit of the sandalwood, slowly stirring little bits at a time into the oil mixture.
2904 2018-08-21 18:13:45 with crude oil production the tenth-highest in the world in 2008, a founding member of the OPEC ... has to use bags to carry the amount of money necessary to buy what is not even found on the market! Of course this is not ONLY Chavez's fault, but I will not go in there.
2905 2018-08-21 18:13:35 Have you tried CBD oil 15%? That works for a lot of people
2906 2018-08-21 18:13:33 What’s stopping a licensed producer from releasing an infused olive oil as a “cannabis oil”? If the carrier oil is olive oil (which it is for at least one LP) and the THC is under permitted levels, why wouldn’t you be able to do that?
2907 2018-08-21 18:13:31 the biggest job in the future will be farming-by hand. the end of the age of cheap oil will require about 1 in 4 Canadians to be professional farmers

2909 2018-08-21 18:13:23 Putin is old. What does he hope for? Dreams? None. He assumes that his people will figure it out or someone will take over. No continuity planning or building for the long term. They have oil to sell and Oligarchs.
2910 2018-08-21 18:13:17 So I bought the Drunk Elephant minis from Sephora cuz I’ve had a lot of new texture and milia- hoping it would be worth the splurge. I used the jelly cleanser + night serum + B hydra serum + Marula face oil for the first time last night not really expecting much after 1 use
2911 2018-08-21 18:12:58 Dilbit is likely to provide ecological impacts that are similar to and extend from those that follow from exposure to lighter crude oil, but the prospect of bitumen settling after binding to suspended sediments elevates the risk for benthic impacts in streams and lakes. #pubmed

2913 2018-08-21 18:12:49 think it’s an extreme.. Venezuela has relied on oil (which tanked) and 20 years of corrupt socialist governments.. not a fan of Brexit vote../ doubt it will happen which will cause problems with the majority who voted
2914 2018-08-21 18:12:39 Snake Oil remains one of my top go-to's for party games.

Why don’t they stop all this sponsorship bollocks?

Thank God we still Play at Oakwell......or have I just opened up a can of worms?
2916 2018-08-21 18:12:28 its really simple

pour olive oil and chicken into the bowl
marinate with spices (like you’d do w/ a braai)
then fry it, then pour coke , 

then after some time you’ll see by the colour and smell hore its ready
2917 2018-08-21 18:12:24 I LCO bc i feel like the oil locks in the moisture but i could be wrong

2919 2018-08-21 18:12:08 Thank you!  They need to know this, because that "calm classroom" oil they just bought is going to make some the class grumpy, dopey and sneezy.
2920 2018-08-21 18:12:06 Every cynical & nihilist move to repeal climate protecting regulations to favor coal and oil will do damage. It is too late to deny climate change. Wildfires, droughts, flooding and rising seal levels on our coasts all tell us the climate is changing and we are at greater risk.
2921 2018-08-21 18:11:58 Consider oil prices. 
At UPA oil prices GDP of NDA would have been 1 or more % point down.
2922 2018-08-21 18:11:54 Ugh.  CBD Oil is the new yoga.  It gets suggested for EVERYTHING
2923 2018-08-21 18:11:46 16 years of breeding to suit the landscape isn't something you just throw away overnight, plus resilience - if ever the world runs out of oil we're going to need livestock more than ever
2924 2018-08-21 18:11:41 Savoury cold soup? Gazpacho or something similar? With sunfower oil and some emulsifier you can make it more energy dense....

2928 2018-08-21 18:11:23 You have literally no idea what you're talking about.
This isn't even close to communism.
It's a largely capitalist economy that's heavily dependent on exports of one resource that it has an abundance of.

2935 2018-08-21 18:10:59 Hopefully they are all available during the last session! The coffee term oil that you brought to great taste was awesome!
2936 2018-08-21 18:10:53 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one

2939 2018-08-21 18:10:38 People equate socialism to 'free everything', which is how Venezuela managed its HUGE income from oil. We can see the result today, the country with the largest proven oil reserves in the world, totaling 297 billion barrels (4.72×1010 m3) as of 1 January 2014,
2940 2018-08-21 18:10:37 It is indeed, and although I didn’t do well with the art classes am tempted by a local 6-week oil landscape course. Want to learn to play bridge too!
2941 2018-08-21 18:10:25 Interesting....Why are they pumping less oil though?

2946 2018-08-21 18:10:09 So I bought a beautiful black F150 in 2016 with a 2.7 turbo boost motor. Currently has around 58K miles on it. To date I've had to replace a oil pan due to a leak, engine had to be torn down to replace gasket heads, and I had to replace part of the turbo... Research before hand!

2948 2018-08-21 18:09:57 Coconut oil is life for skin and hair  Out here looking like a honey bun and shit 
2949 2018-08-21 18:09:51 Oil en effet belle soirée
2950 2018-08-21 18:09:36 I’ve worked in oil field, automotive, agriculture and industrial supplies… I had conversations with people working for me about these issues. I never looked at it as industry specific. The real issue is how do we make it better without arguing semantics?
2951 2018-08-21 18:09:34 Can't moan at that, roast turnips are not to be sniffed at,  olive oil, seasalt black pepper seasoning, the jobs a good en.
2952 2018-08-21 18:09:27 Kinda' disappointing Wend, that they use Palm Oil. I tweeted them a while back and they said it was Sustainable, but I'm informed there's no such thing. Confusing, though I don't think a company like that should touch it, to be honest...
2953 2018-08-21 18:09:26 Oil Sykes al be fuckin havin ye
2954 2018-08-21 18:09:25 The Koch Bros are one of the wealthiest families in America, their main business is refining heavy crude oil to gasoline as well as other dirty fuel and they’re big conservative contributors to Rupert Murdoch’s FOX news and most republican candidates in the country. Pollution=$$$
2955 2018-08-21 18:09:23 I love the way my car drives after a good ol oil change!!!
2956 2018-08-21 18:09:22 This guy can't stand still for 5 minutes without lying. First he kills his wife and kids and dumps the kids in a full OIL TANK. Then he maligns his dead wife who cannot defend herself. I guess that he forgot that he confessed to the crimes to the Frederick police. POS du jour.
2957 2018-08-21 18:09:19 I feel like everytime I come Lucas Oil to get an oil change they happen to find “something wrong” with my car.  At the point the only reason they get my business is because I get a student discount
2958 2018-08-21 18:09:09 Just got a whole fresh bottle of Castor Oil  I’m sooo happy !

2962 2018-08-21 18:08:47 Agreed — in part, the gold China seeks to accumulate and has been accumulating for years is to peg the Yuan to gold and undermine the U.S. dollar/petrodollar as the #1 reserve currency in the world. In some cases, happening as we speak in commodities trade deals i.e. oil
2963 2018-08-21 18:08:44 So I placed an order to go long Crude oil at 67.02 9 lots but I was executed at 68.51 um ????????????
2964 2018-08-21 18:08:33 Screw coal, I want some of that sperm whale oil for me lamps!

2966 2018-08-21 18:08:32 When the corporations stop milking us for oil, gas and electricity, they will lie to us and tell us we are short of water and that will be the new tax to keep them rich and us enslaved to them! China have also been buying fresh water and storing it for decades!
2967 2018-08-21 18:08:20 Xx
2968 2018-08-21 18:08:20 I agree, A&M would want him to be proven in the SEC..  5-7 years before throwing the oil tycoon money at him. Don't get me wrong, I'm not wanting this to happen. Its just my hunch if he does aswell here as I hope he does.
2969 2018-08-21 18:08:15 Another possibility is it is the oil pipeline that is coming from Platform Holly, that could be holding a charge, as it is a sand colored pipe, hence Sandpiper, or it could be something on Platform Holly that is facilitating it.
2970 2018-08-21 18:08:00 You promised to bring troops home, ya oil snake selling cult leading, broke schmuck! What the f**k are you doing, ya nimrod? Yer rich right? Buy some clues, putz! =) xoxo #War #HBDC #Demented45 #Sucker #Cult
2971 2018-08-21 18:07:28 We need leaders on board to transition effectively. In a democracy this means the pressure must come from a well-informed populace. Given the lies we've been told by oil and gas companies already, the sweetheart deals etc. we owe them no favours. And also, our future is at stake.
2972 2018-08-21 18:07:24 :( my oil pen is deceased.
2973 2018-08-21 18:07:14 Is CBD oil frowned upon in Europe?

2975 2018-08-21 18:06:59 Today just hasn’t been my day!! My car has a bad oil leak and I don’t know if it’s fixable so I didn’t have a ride to school and then I was an hour late to one of my labs!! Not a good way to start the semester
2976 2018-08-21 18:06:42 I chuck them in hot oil with salt, turmeric powder and chilli flakes. Sizzle, sizzle, then serve alongside a curry or just with raita and rice and a blob of lime pickle.
2977 2018-08-21 18:06:31 His claim that his wife killed the kids is ridiculous and a disgusting smear of the real victim.  No loving father could dump his little girls’ bodies in an oil drum, no matter how they died.
2978 2018-08-21 18:06:18 Shoulda grabbed a burger before waiting in line for an oil change in Ft Mac.
2979 2018-08-21 18:06:15 Cannabis oil, which is the active ingredient in 'edibles', will be available on day one. So while there won't be 'edible' food products immediately, the products which contain the active ingredient, and provide the same effect, will be.
2980 2018-08-21 18:06:01 It's a from birth thing. It all goes through a tube. She's tough as hell about it and used to it. She keeps eating like she has been, we might be able to get her off tubes soon. Her liquid is peptamen, green bean baby food, canola oil, and citric acid.

and yet nothing because, liberals demand it.
2986 2018-08-21 18:05:28 Issa must i go get my oil changed this week.
2987 2018-08-21 18:05:22 Okay I really need to buy new scrubs. Oil stains from my chapstick on my scrubs too.

2990 2018-08-21 18:05:16 I really do love the Norwex laundry detergent the most. Really gets the grease/fuel/oil smell out of my husbands work clothes as well as the dirt. He’s an auto mechanic & obviously gets very dirty doing his job.

2995 2018-08-21 18:05:00 I get that. Educate yourself before you get to throwing holy oil on the walls
2996 2018-08-21 18:04:41 Pick up some sacramentals like the Saint Benedict medal in a crucifix and The Miraculous Medal a rosary the Mother of Sorrows Chaplet and some holy oil and blessed salt and put on the armor of God
2997 2018-08-21 18:04:38 Funny you left out the all of the oil and gas wells on the eastern plains that flare natural gas, leak methane and create enormous amounts of air pollution that impacts wildlife and human health.
2998 2018-08-21 18:04:33 ma try nga nag plateau na kasi ang katawan ko now mix naman work out ko kaya naisip ko baka sa food nga ko nagkaka prob. so you mean tlgang inom ng coco ut oil? and gano karaming portion ng fatty food?
2999 2018-08-21 18:04:33 Going to get my oil changed and they are like “are you gonna stick around or head out?” Like ummmm you have my car lol yeah I’m just gonna go ahead and walk home real fast
3000 2018-08-21 18:04:15 Came to the dealership for a simple oil change and got quoted $996 for 60k mike service and $793 for tires  I love adulting.
3001 2018-08-21 18:03:57 They do it because they know their largely uneducated listenership is stupid enough to buy the snake oil.
3002 2018-08-21 18:03:53 IDC if my car is on fire. I came here for an Oil Change only, nothing else fam 
3003 2018-08-21 18:03:41 Ghee roast is normal dosa using ghee instead of oil. Tastes real good. Haven't had it since '96 though!
3004 2018-08-21 18:03:35 nice skin is all I've ever wished for. This witch hazel and coconut oil is doing wonders
3005 2018-08-21 18:03:05 c that a game mechanic; the rain being so caustic nothing can survive under it. As well, the corrupting substance "phazon" was a good way to show kids how devastating something that looks like oil can be by introducing it to an environment. A lot needless damage to nature.
3006 2018-08-21 18:02:50 Thank you Mr Adrian !!! xx
3007 2018-08-21 18:02:41 Even if he's right, because he dumped them @ an oil site, he's wrong. Doesn't matter if he was in an emotional panic and thought it was rationally acceptable, he's wrong. Doesn't matter if he thought telling the police what she did prior to killing her.... still lost

3011 2018-08-21 18:02:24 Oh! And yes, a garden salad. Toms, chives and lemon basil. All out the garden, just with Himalayan pink salt, pepper and olive oil. With corn on the cob, baby steamed potatoes and southern fried chicken steaks.

3015 2018-08-21 18:02:15 There is no “war on coal.”  It’s time has passed. Like cell phones compared to “party lines,” a bygone era. New technologies, gas, oil, solar, wind, all more competitive. Air pollution from coal does not stop at state lines. Coal will speed global warming and cause illness.
3016 2018-08-21 18:02:08 Let’s make one thing clear. The GOP IS the deep state. They won 2 elections in 16 years without the popular vote. They are the big corporate state, controlled by oil, military contracts, pharmaceuticals/insurance companies. The Koch Bros alone spent 900 million in 2016 election.
3017 2018-08-21 18:02:06 I’ve never taken my car to get an oil change by myself #imsoproud
3018 2018-08-21 18:02:02 the oil needs changing but its pretty good. 7/10.
3019 2018-08-21 18:01:57 just so yall know charli xcx was scamming tf out of her fans at lucas oil stadium charging $112 to listen to her music wtf
3020 2018-08-21 18:01:56 Well of course we got oil.  But if you really believe the military is just a bunch of greedy child murderers, then you’re delusional.
3021 2018-08-21 18:01:53 and todays life lesson is don’t forget to put the egg in brownie mix otherwise you will be left w boiling oil/chocolate mix in a pan
3022 2018-08-21 18:01:50 The GOP is all for buying oil that funds the bullets flying at our troops overseas.

3030 2018-08-21 18:01:16 Except, oil money did flow in earlier too. And it didn't go to help the poor. So what option do you think poor will take?

Indeed Tony.  Be it Satanism, Illuminati, or whatever, it is nefarious, the by-product of having such wealth and power, invincibility and whim sets in.

History always has them, Rothschild, Soros, Murdoch, Hearst, MGM, Rockefeller, JP Morgan, oil and railroad barons, et al.
3046 2018-08-21 18:00:12 Know what’s unfair? The amount of health benefits coconut oil has and the fact that I’m allergic to it.
3047 2018-08-21 18:00:11 The THC & CBD cannabinoid's found in the plant attacks cancer cells.
The THC is psychoactive cannabinoid - which causes it's legal issues.
The CBD is non-psychoactive whilst having many health benefits - which has no legal issues (Legal medical use Marijuana - CBD Oil).
3048 2018-08-21 18:00:09 It turns out that yelling at your pancakes when the oil starts spitting doesn't work quite as well as turning the heat down

3051 2018-08-21 17:59:56 I'm pretty handy. I love that I can change my oil and breaks, I built my own closet and I like to fix things.
3052 2018-08-21 17:59:47 The bottle should be in a dark color to prevent penetration of light that can ruin the oil.

Have you taken it into consideration?
3053 2018-08-21 17:59:37 The falling pound, means the value of that brent oil is even more for us brits. And a UK North sea producer like #i3e will have costs in GBP...so profitability should increase.
3054 2018-08-21 17:59:33 fossil fuel and oil wealth are not the same. do modern social democracies fund their social welfare with oil wealth?

3077 2018-08-21 17:57:25 The majority of vehicles i see on the road in PHX are not in the class of high fuel economy.  Trucks, huge pick up and older cars that most states would not register in the first place.  This logic is expected from people with huge ties to the oil companies.
3078 2018-08-21 17:57:18 well hart lied said previous he would not comment on politics but liars and haters do this
3079 2018-08-21 17:57:13 Exactly!! He fucking dumped them in oil tanks and like half buried his wife
3080 2018-08-21 17:57:11 Buzz rothfield and in depth analysis go together like oil and water
3081 2018-08-21 17:56:49 the Saudis jails are full of opposition start from journalists writers to the member of his family, which refused to pay him off, and the west is doing business needs his cash and oil praise him selling arms to kill women children and men in Yemen,
3082 2018-08-21 17:56:45 Just telling you I'm pretty sure your going in the wrong direction on this one. The laws should be tougher. When you talk / write stuff like this all I see is you in the back pocket of the oil industry. I feel sorry for y"'all that don't believe what science is telling you.
3083 2018-08-21 17:56:41 some of them own artisanal mayo and beard oil shops in brooklyn.
3084 2018-08-21 17:56:37 Does anyone know where I can get beard oil from, asking for a friend, 

It's me. I'm the friend, I want beard oil for myself.
3085 2018-08-21 17:56:18 Fat helps tell your brain you’re full- so full fat cottage cheese, cheese, nuts, popcorn made me coconut oil and ghee, dark chocolate mousse made with snowville cream 
3086 2018-08-21 17:56:14 But keep selling them weapons and Canadian corporations will keep buying their oil right?
3087 2018-08-21 17:56:14 And socialism hasn’t worked either, anyone can make the books look good with stacks of oil money flowing in. Where would Saudi Arabia be without it?
3088 2018-08-21 17:56:12 Really?? Did you say he bombed somalia...do they even have oil?? Thats strange. Are you mixing up obama with bush?
3089 2018-08-21 17:56:10 ありがとうです！！(*´ω｀*)
3090 2018-08-21 17:56:07 You had me up to "baby oil comes from babies"
3091 2018-08-21 17:56:03 most of you nuts need it stuck to you
3092 2018-08-21 17:55:55 At a restaurant downtown that had no butter or olive oil to serve with their bread. Could not serve a plate of pasta and olive oil for one of the kids with us. Maybe two blocks from the downtown grocery store.
3093 2018-08-21 17:55:53 “Change happens slowly.” Yeah, I’ll remember that when I’m fifteen feet underwater thanks to the oil and gas industry (which funds both parties).

Yes, Hillary would have continued the work Obama started, which furthered income inequality but targeted plenty of $ for war.
3094 2018-08-21 17:55:40 I missed WW3 y'all. I was told it was coming last year if we did anything Putin didn't like. People who were hysterical about it aren't hysterical about angering Saudis who like could launch oil blockade  Almost like they're just Putin sympathizers.

3096 2018-08-21 17:55:35 Choose a vodka martini, shaken not stirred,
Choose an Aston Martin with ejector seat and oil slick buttons, 
Choose living in retirement still bound by the Official Secrets Act, nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish Double-00s they've spawned to replace you
Choose ice
3097 2018-08-21 17:55:31 Oil will run out someday.  Sooner than larer, if we keep wasting it. But Trumps oil baron buddies are short sighted and only care about making money now.
3098 2018-08-21 17:55:16 Hehehe use castor oil <3!
3099 2018-08-21 17:55:11 SO WILL TRUMP
3100 2018-08-21 17:55:11 I mean if corn oil comes from corn and baby oil comes from babies. Bear oil could only come from bears, ent?
3101 2018-08-21 17:54:52 Imagine loving your kids so much, you dispose of their bodies by stuffing them in oil drums to rot in an almost abandoned area then driving away. Yeah, I don't think the word "love" fits.
3102 2018-08-21 17:54:48 Why can’t I control myself at tea time  go from chicken sausages, eggs, salad in the day to real ale pies and peas or paella with crusty bread and oil dip  #ChunkyButAlsoNotFunky #ForgotTheGlassOfRedToo
3103 2018-08-21 17:54:33 I agree, hart is just another one thinking the wrong is right. I love Trump!!!These low lifes should be kissing the PRESIDENTS FEET WHILE THEY ARE ON THEIR KNEES OR SOMETHING ELSE LOL
3104 2018-08-21 17:54:33 How long until you're back home and able to take your oil?
3105 2018-08-21 17:54:26 You havent got any money ... , whos going to pay your uni fees & prescription charges then ... you will vote with your wallet again . Oh BTW ... its not YOUR oil ...

3110 2018-08-21 17:53:57 Thank you  ..but my pants look like they are oil painted 
3111 2018-08-21 17:53:51 i smell like honey and coconut oil. yummy
3112 2018-08-21 17:53:40 Time to get a little bit excited about

 #UOG 

United Oil & Gas
3113 2018-08-21 17:53:36 That was Iran's own frozen funds & it was peanuts to #Iran. Iran has the largest reserves of natural gas on earth. The 4th largest oil reserves in the world. Iran builds 1.5 million cars a year. Uneducated ppl like u though don't know these things.
3114 2018-08-21 17:53:15 Rose oil is a great moisturizer for oily skin 
3115 2018-08-21 17:53:05 Are there any chiropractors using CBD Oil for their patient's pain management? If not, why? Message me to let me know either way, please.

3116 2018-08-21 17:52:30 got assaulted today at work by a man wielding a bottle of oil..people are crazy.
3117 2018-08-21 17:52:05 Just found out #Nutella contains #palmoil it just never occurred to me anyhow no more products will I be buying that contain palm oil !!!!
3118 2018-08-21 17:52:04 Oil story
3119 2018-08-21 17:52:02 We don't need to spend billions more on oil that's already being delivered they don't need more oil being brought in we need billions of dollars put into new energy infrastructure.
3120 2018-08-21 17:51:51 Staying the course with fracking is absolutely hurting our air and water. Establishment Dems (and I used to consider myself one) need to realize we have to change our old way of thinking, even if oil and gas donors don't like it.
3121 2018-08-21 17:51:47 So there's no such thing as a soul?

And do you always wear white and anoint your head with oil?
3122 2018-08-21 17:51:47 Since putting Baobab oil on my hair and washing it with cold water, it is GLOWING 
3123 2018-08-21 17:51:35 Coal?!? Really? Why not bring back whale oil?
3124 2018-08-21 17:51:31 I find it frustrating part about all of this back and forth is that we're still not answering the most important question -off of oil.
When are we going to start talking about other energy sources we have available now geothermal tidal and solar.
3125 2018-08-21 17:51:23 So Mad Nala Father Mess Up My Fucking Shirt With Dhat Car Oil  Stupid Ass

3127 2018-08-21 17:51:07 And that box is slippery like tryna walk on oil.
3128 2018-08-21 17:51:07 which modern social democracies fund their social welfare with oil wealth?
3129 2018-08-21 17:51:01 There going to sue Donnie to get it back all that oil up for grabs
3130 2018-08-21 17:50:56 I hope they decide to settle this once and for all and fight for Kylo’s honor in the traditional Arkanisian way. Naked and covered in oil.
3131 2018-08-21 17:50:54 And don’t forget he saw that on a baby monitor- and tossing your babies in a crude oil tank is just what all “good” dads do. 
3132 2018-08-21 17:50:36 How many of those (less than 10% of eligible voters) who voted know what a tip credit is or how it works? This measure was  sold to the public like snake oil. You should be ashamed of yourselves.
3133 2018-08-21 17:50:32 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.
3134 2018-08-21 17:50:26 can someone who’s painted with actual paint and not aerosol based products tell me what the differences are between acrylic and oil and whatever else is out there i’m tryna express some creativity upon y’all
3135 2018-08-21 17:50:17 I like old fashioned American on buttered Itailan bread. I then sprinkle garlic powder on each side with a touch of garlic oil in the pan. Low heat so I don't burn it. Like cheese sandwiches/garlic bread.
3136 2018-08-21 17:50:04 ...how many revolutions has Venezuela had in the last century?...for oil?...it's nothing to do with socialism it's capitalist regimes causing chaos to get rich...to get their grubby hands in the oil...
3137 2018-08-21 17:50:02 Can you please bring back whale oil!!!
3138 2018-08-21 17:49:59 I have to get a oil change after class  I’ve been super busy this week and it’s only Tuesday
3139 2018-08-21 17:49:57 no oil in the salad dressing today
3140 2018-08-21 17:49:52 
3141 2018-08-21 17:49:50 Pruitt's phone call from his stupid "cone of silence" was probably to an oil lobbyist to find out which regulations they wanted removed
3142 2018-08-21 17:49:47 Not to mention, the United States has plenty of oil we could use to help our citizens as well.
3143 2018-08-21 17:49:40 They really can't risk a trial. The actual details would implicate too many others. 
Getting as close to Clinton treatment as you can get without actually being a Clinton.
3144 2018-08-21 17:49:24 The secret to happiness is to see all the marvels of the world,  and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.
3145 2018-08-21 17:49:21 <オイルをぶっかけオイルをぶっかけられヌタヌタのヌラヌラのテカテカにしたろか?
3146 2018-08-21 17:49:20 Spot on, Amazing how much they drink & swallow that narrative of oil - it's almost like they're bought & paid to market oil
3147 2018-08-21 17:49:15 In fairness, the one big difference between Scandinavian socialism and socialism in Latin America is that the US never embargoed Norway, even though they nationalised their oil industry. The difference is that when Norway did it, it wasn’t at the expense of US capitalists.
3148 2018-08-21 17:49:14 if you’re not putting on coconut oil after a shower then honestly wyd
3149 2018-08-21 17:49:09 But nontheless when primary energy is in [mtoe] units that "waste" is taken into account by conversion factor. BP stats review states:

"One million tonnes of oil or oil equivalent produces about 4400 gigawatt-hours (=4.4 terawatt hours) of electricity in a modern power station"
3150 2018-08-21 17:48:50 Argan oil really does work its just that I was stupid and didn't know you're supposed to apply a little on damp hair
3151 2018-08-21 17:48:44 @WFPK - how about "Sometimes" by Midnight Oil.  "Sometimes you're shaken to the core; Sometimes the face is gonna fall; But you don't give in"
3152 2018-08-21 17:48:44 Cant listen to Lopez she is bribed by big-oil-and-short-mafia. She has a LOT to lose if Tesla succeeds in it’s mission. btw apple will buy tesla

3159 2018-08-21 17:47:58 Interestingly over half of the world's #vetiver oil is supplied by #Haiti. This oil is an essential oil used in high-end #perfumes. Why aren't these things known? Who is it serving to perpetuate such a largely negative narrative about Haiti?
3160 2018-08-21 17:47:55 In the oval office, Laura Bush would only scarf "Texas size sushi rolls" and work on ad hoc accounting statements for Zapata Oil Drilling Services and keep tract of anything busy and "personnel" in the company while Jenn's job was to run errands fetching sandwiches and lutefish
3161 2018-08-21 17:47:48 The entire industrial economy relies on oil what on earth are you talking about??
3162 2018-08-21 17:47:41 I’m particularly allergic to orange oil products. I don’t even have asthma I’m just allergic to some smelly stuff and perfume.
3163 2018-08-21 17:47:39 u cannot TRADE and TALK ABOUT it 
if u didnt buy and sell it
at least a hundred times in your life

3166 2018-08-21 17:47:26 Oil money was distributed towards social programs and made a huge difference in alleviating poverty. The centrist/right has largely failed poorer Venezuelans. Hence they voted for Chavez.
3167 2018-08-21 17:47:11 2 looks like the best fit for olive oil. The others look good too, but maybe not for olive oil.
3168 2018-08-21 17:47:11 ขอบคุณค่าา
3169 2018-08-21 17:47:11 @VinnieTortorich Cassava flour?? I keep seeing “grain free” chips. Often don’t in sunflower oil though.
3170 2018-08-21 17:46:56 But onion rings cooked in coconut oil taste so good. 
3171 2018-08-21 17:46:42 Keep it in the fridge, will last about two months. Will solidify. Use instead/in addition to veg oil when making a curry. 
3172 2018-08-21 17:46:42 Manafort is just what you said and probably MORE ...  msm always says they are President Trump’s ... oh! Will they FLIP on trump ... so sad ...
3173 2018-08-21 17:46:27 Hot take: no politician actually believes that climate change is fake/doesn't understand it. They simply do not care about ethics or the future of this planet and will only operate within their best interests (aka oil companies' best interests)
3174 2018-08-21 17:46:04 Going to get a fresh oil change and a state inspection
3175 2018-08-21 17:46:01 No more earth burger for me,them ninjas using vegetable oil
3176 2018-08-21 17:45:58 @MeganAGolden Green Life Auto was pretty easy for me to deal with . just test drive lots. Stop the car and accelerate. Most cars will have minor problems. Need tires. Oil change. Test the engine and transmission. Test A.c. and heater. What type of car are you wanting???

3180 2018-08-21 17:45:28 The pilgrimage industry is the Saudi Arabia's 2nd most important after oil & gas. Haj and the umrah pilgrimage (which can be performed at any time of the year) add an estimated $12 billion a year to Saudi's GDP. That's about 20% of the kingdom's non-oil GDP and 7% of total GDP.
3181 2018-08-21 17:45:20 Estimado @Gaston_Remy: Quisiéramos consultarle si Vista Oil también exportará gas natural a Chile este año y/o el que viene. Muchas gracias. Dirección @OETEC
3182 2018-08-21 17:45:17 Lol. Is that the best you've got? Ha'aretz also publish Gideon Levy, the arch-critic of the Israeli government. Is that for geographical reasons related to oil?
3183 2018-08-21 17:45:14 Should I be an adult and get my oil changed today or should I wait until tomorrow so my mom can go with me
3184 2018-08-21 17:45:12 Only that of many economists  and businesses. Bear in mind that Norway manages to achieve nearly twice as much profit per barrel of oil as the U.K. does. Can’t imagine why that’s the case......privatising the oil industry was a huge costly mistake mind you and didn’t create much
3185 2018-08-21 17:45:09 Ingredient Watch: Brominated vegetable oil ("BVO") in your sodas this August? This flame retardant can be used to prevent separation.
3186 2018-08-21 17:45:03 The Prodigal Son is my favorite of Christ's parables as everyone has to return to Father in Heaven eventually. With that said, I think Carlos Henderson is more one of the five virgins without oil in the lamp. It's too late for him now.

3190 2018-08-21 17:44:46 Came to get an oil change and the mechanic was super impressed with my car.. he asked if he could sit down in the driver’s seat for a little bit 
3191 2018-08-21 17:44:43 Cause you oil your hair like you s’posed to! 
3192 2018-08-21 17:44:40 Yes! Or just roasting it in the oven with a little olive oil, garlic, and s&p.
3193 2018-08-21 17:44:04 For oil change
3194 2018-08-21 17:44:02 Now that fish oil has been removed from the vendors, fishing could end up being very profitable!
3195 2018-08-21 17:43:33 You loved your kids so much but you load them into your truck like pieces of garbage and place them in oil drums and had the nerve to go to work like nothing happened yea I definitely believe you 
3196 2018-08-21 17:43:07 Saudi Arabia can do no harm while they buy our arms and sell oil. how are going to kill her? crucifixion?
3197 2018-08-21 17:43:06 When the oil money no longer supports an oppressive regime. Environmentalists aren't the only ones pushing for renewable energy; oil dependence blinds people to whatever else is going on.
3198 2018-08-21 17:42:57 This man is STRAIGHT UP LYING.... If she killed your kids why you dump the BODIES IN OIL RIGS?????? #Fryhisass
3199 2018-08-21 17:42:49 Had better days but been stuck up to my elbows in muck and oil repairing my van.
3200 2018-08-21 17:42:48 And he was so distraught about his wife killing his daughters that he dumped the two little bodies into oil tanks? #POS
3201 2018-08-21 17:42:42 Take a steam, add some eucalyptus oil to the water. Try warm compression around your nasal passage, in between your eyes. Have a hot curry or raw chilli.. All the best
3202 2018-08-21 17:42:38 B took my car and got my oil changed, washed my car, and got my inspection done 
3203 2018-08-21 17:42:14 This murderer is claiming he didn’t murder his children, his wife did and he walked in on it and killed her out of rage. This same man claimed he put his daughters in oil cans to hide the smell. Someone who didn’t murder their children doesn’t also stuff their bodies in cans
3204 2018-08-21 17:42:08 Which clean energy organization? These days with Astroturfing any organisation can claim to be "clean energy" while advocating coal and oil.

Regardless of the fact both are far from clean.
3205 2018-08-21 17:42:07 Not if eat a week's worth :)
We used to have one but I think he took a corner too fast and covered the van in hot oil and hake.
3206 2018-08-21 17:42:06 I can’t lie I was expecting something more exciting visually being a Gamescom reveal, rainforest, arctic weather station, oil rig lashed by stormy seas maybe? This looks like a boring map to play, the best maps will be the remastered ones.

3208 2018-08-21 17:42:02 The connection to extinction of j pod from ships carrying oil is a created association that has no evidence of ever occurring?  It is fear based with little actual proof of effect. There are so many other pressures on that group of Orca that might disperse or end that lineage
3209 2018-08-21 17:41:59 Hit me if you need an oil change 
3210 2018-08-21 17:41:47 Not exactly. A lot of left-wing snake oil salesmen also are purveyors and strong believers of the cult of the snake oil of dietary supplement-kind.

3213 2018-08-21 17:41:22 Went to get an oil change and it turns out my mechanic graduated from #LoyolaChicago, so he didn’t charge me and said “ this one is from one Alum to a future Alum. #GoRamblers”
3214 2018-08-21 17:41:21 They just settled an arbitration case with a US producer of oil ConocoPhillips for $2billion. Before that, PDVSA had their assets seized and couldn't export their oil reliably to the Caribbean. This also comes from bad leadership from the Chavez era.
3215 2018-08-21 17:41:10 [sotto voce] Turns out, you can't have non-renewables without infrastructure, either, and no one, but no one, wants a coal or oil fired generating station in their backyard. Or a nuclear power plant, either.
3216 2018-08-21 17:41:10 I believe an Oil Company or a Rent a Car Company might make a great Strategic Rideshare Partner.
3217 2018-08-21 17:40:59 Not to mention renewable energy can produce more jobs and gdp growth than oil but the trick is to convince the American people to produce some ourselves like Norway with oil.
3218 2018-08-21 17:40:48 I got a phat oil stain on my shorts and now I feel insecure
3219 2018-08-21 17:40:47 Love/hate oil pastels

3221 2018-08-21 17:40:43 Kinda like losing the office of the President because you're a lying, cheating, traitorous snake oil salesman? Gotcha.
3222 2018-08-21 17:40:35 Lol! I think I found a miracle tho. A jumbo jar of 100% Coconut Oil. Face, teeth, hair. Cooking. 10 bucks 
3223 2018-08-21 17:40:32 To the yummy man that just went out of his way to say hello to me at the oil change place. Hi I’m Kellsie, love me... pls
3224 2018-08-21 17:40:22 I have discovered in adulthood once I started cooking for myself that I like broccoli in literally all its incarnations except for the cooked to death one. One of my faves is just some olive oil, a shit-ton of garlic, chopped broccoli and a pile of cheese mixed with pasta.
3225 2018-08-21 17:40:17 バターとかマーガリンとか知らないけど多分吸ったぜ。
3226 2018-08-21 17:40:13 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
3227 2018-08-21 17:40:11 No we are selling palm oil
3228 2018-08-21 17:40:11 It is CLEAR that Corbyn wants a #Brexit that will cost 100s of thousands of jobs in #Scotland and devastate Scotland Politically, Economically and Socially.

Corbyn will fund London Labour #Brexit with #Scotland's OIL Revenue.

3231 2018-08-21 17:40:00 The same girl who diffused tea tree oil in the office just heated up broccoli and I think she should be fired.
3232 2018-08-21 17:39:39 ....and they continue to do it, plus add in almost ALL of the news media.  Won't be too hard to see what is going to happen in 2020.
3233 2018-08-21 17:39:39 Plane pilot is trying to burn oil in air before emergency landing to avoid explosion !
3234 2018-08-21 17:39:39 No it can’t. Snake oil.
3235 2018-08-21 17:39:36 バカヤロー！
3236 2018-08-21 17:39:28 high healthy fat (avocado coconut oil etc) low carb... so instead of your body using carbs for energy it uses fat hence u lose weight from your fat reserves
3237 2018-08-21 17:39:27 Suddenly come clean? No, GERS showed a net positive balance during the height of the oil boom. I can show you all the historical figures if you wish.
3238 2018-08-21 17:39:16 Don't know what being in a tank of oil would do to forensic evidence, though.
3239 2018-08-21 17:39:03 Diluted pure frankincense oil or cbd oil in coconut oil may offer some relief and healing. Be sure it’s a quality brand. Read up on it. Hugs and love to your sweet Martha. 
3240 2018-08-21 17:39:00 Esto está científicamente chequeado? Porque siempre creía que era deformidad mía... A QUIÉN LE MANDO CARTA DOCUMENTO AHORA? A MOTOR OIL? ???
3241 2018-08-21 17:38:54 OK (idk what that is) is that why I can use both to remove oil paint from my skin? (I didn't have paint thinner and then I remember seeing my uncle use kerosene to get it off his hand and stuff and I did and it worked)
3242 2018-08-21 17:38:53 That was Iran's own frozen funds & that money was peanuts to them anyways. #Iran has the largest reserves of natural gas on earth, the 4th largest reserves of oil. They produce 1.5 million cars a year. It's a country of 80 million people.
3243 2018-08-21 17:38:51 I don't think people have been presented with a true picture of Venezuela and certainly not the fact that the US is punishing them with depressed oil prices and a weaponized $.

3245 2018-08-21 17:38:44 Also your teachings has been a blessing to my son. He listens to you alot, he talks about how great of a teacher you are. Thank You! More favor, oil, 120% restoration in Jesus Name.
3246 2018-08-21 17:38:42 saw today somebody had bought service kit for there st225 at cost 112/115 plugs x oil x filters  i do job lot fitted £160.0 book stamped with premium oil castrol or shell helix
3247 2018-08-21 17:38:39 The oil wealth has been mostly spent
3248 2018-08-21 17:38:37 @Awkturtle1 great to see the price moving higher despite the late prints. Expect to see this trend to continue all week up to first oil shows and then beyond  #AAOG
3249 2018-08-21 17:38:18 Despite being d highest tax contributor to d Exchequer, Mumbai's infrastructure is in shambles-roads are just not able to handle d traffic n people r subjected to spending hours in d crawling traffic -doesn't help d Happiness index or oil consumption! @narendramodi @Dev_Fadnavis
3250 2018-08-21 17:38:12 I didn't elect Trump.  Blame it on the Katy Perrys of the world. All of the celebrities who loudmouthed for Hillary drove the Midwest insane. It was a vote against Hillary, against celebrity, against pompous a-holes (elites). Trump just happened to be the lucky beneficiary.
3251 2018-08-21 17:38:11 Hey @POTUS The Russians are playing Army while we’re playing Boy Scouts!

Light their asses up!  

Turn our #HACKERS loose!

Shut down their oil & gas fields & power grids!

FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE!
3252 2018-08-21 17:38:09 Not to mention his Duetche Bank & Cyprus Bank life, shipping oil business, money laundering (etc)!
3253 2018-08-21 17:38:07 Anyone needing CBD oil I'll be in Lawrenceburg area message me.
3254 2018-08-21 17:38:00 Everywhere socialism is tried it fails! Case in point Venezuela! Rich in oil! But poor in everything! 
3255 2018-08-21 17:37:51 CAPCO STRONG!!
3256 2018-08-21 17:37:42 ต้องศิลปินที่ขึ้นแสดงวันเดียวกันกับบัตรเท่านั้นค่า
3257 2018-08-21 17:37:32 I take it you must be in a position to gain monetarily from big oil, gas or coal. You are corrupt and part of the swamp and must be removed.
3258 2018-08-21 17:37:26 I use coconut oil, don’t even scratch & I’m getting some:( good thing their light tho...
3259 2018-08-21 17:37:25 Definite clickbait, kroenke has just bought the club for £1.8bn if we don't spend & fall behind the value of his asset plummets. My guess is he spends more now that he doesn't have to share the spoils with usmanov. But obvs won't spend like oil clubs.
3260 2018-08-21 17:37:21 Depends what you classify as ideology. Chavismo did fine when oil money was flowing in. Now corruption and incompetence rule
3261 2018-08-21 17:37:13 Will CBD oil make me hate my life less?
3262 2018-08-21 17:37:06 They cannot drive stick or check the oil either. It's  hard being that dumb LMBO
3263 2018-08-21 17:37:04 The one thing I’m not liking bout keto is all the butter and oil they tell you to consume. I’m straight.
3264 2018-08-21 17:37:02  he said red oil jollof
3265 2018-08-21 17:36:55 "Why" is, of course, because of the bloody oil. This sort of shite has been what I consider an unarguably good reason for ditching fossil fuel since long before anyone even thought of climate change. Too good for governments to act on...
3266 2018-08-21 17:36:42 So the nation should breath polluted air? Even with this action the facts are that coal is a dying industry, no new coal plants are being built, all oil & gas. It's time the GOP be honest with these people and tell them the hard truth instead of stringing them along.
3267 2018-08-21 17:36:41 So then he shoves his baby girls bodies into oil barrels? Yeah...that seems normal.
3268 2018-08-21 17:36:35 I have an orecchiette ("little ears" pasta) recipe that involves rapini, onions, anchovies, olive oil and parmesan cheese. It is DELISH.
3269 2018-08-21 17:36:34 That bomb ass feeling when you leave O’rielly with a fresh oil change and your tires rotated 
3270 2018-08-21 17:36:27 What a damn liar. That's why he submerged his children in an oil tank? Right. Give em the chair. Fentonyl is too sweet.
3271 2018-08-21 17:36:20 That is very true! Yes be careful when using any type of citrus oil when you are exposed to an excessive amount of sunlight!
3272 2018-08-21 17:36:15 Women get a car and don’t check no oil, no tire pressure, no nothing they just wake up and drive that hoe
3273 2018-08-21 17:36:14 Oh yeah the peppermint oil literally heats up when you rub it in (almost burns) feels amazing!
3274 2018-08-21 17:36:08 They be making it seem like you’re driving a death trap or your car is dying on you at any time when you take it for an oil change 
3275 2018-08-21 17:36:05 Fur is far greener and more sustainable than the oil based synthetic material 90% of people are wearing right now.
3276 2018-08-21 17:36:00 In my experience, cubing them up and roasting them in the oven with onion, garlic, olive oil, lots of salt and pepper seems to work. Another option is using more savory spices like cumin and chili powder. Hope that helps!
3277 2018-08-21 17:35:42 Yeah, can you imagine??? I’d hold my babies until the coroner would make the cops put me in a strait jacket.  If he could drop a his toddlers in a tank full of crude oil - he did it. He was the one that watched their faces turn blue under his hands. 
3278 2018-08-21 17:35:40 He put his babies in £ucking oil tankers! No one who is innocent does $hit like that!
3279 2018-08-21 17:35:39 Done this before. A little off track. Point is the iphone trade deficit is $400M not $100B as counted. Exclude Iphones and oil trade, the US trade deficit is < 1% GDP. Possibly even a surplus excluding commodities.
3280 2018-08-21 17:35:37 That's why I was rating him as he was more like Red Oil Jollof..
3281 2018-08-21 17:35:33 @AndrewScheer I keep hearing that you dont support Unions or union jobs? Is this true? Working in the oil and gas industries I find that regardless of who is in power, they do jack for the people. Harper was selling Canadians out to foreign investors while Trudeau is an idiot.
3282 2018-08-21 17:35:33 Okay because this essential oil have my face feeling greeeaaaaaaat.
3283 2018-08-21 17:35:30 If there was ever a better example of @POTUS as a sideshow huckster, I can't think of one. There should be another table selling snake oil.
3284 2018-08-21 17:35:26 idk why these people keep pointing at venezuela as if it was socialism that destroyed everything rather than intense government corruption and bad strategic moves on oil
3285 2018-08-21 17:35:24 There's a sense in which all modern developed-world economies have oil wealth because we're living an unsustainable lifestyle based on fossil fuels (including the Finns).  We're still robbing from our children and grandchildren, we're just distributing the loot more evenly.
3286 2018-08-21 17:35:23 And they'll be hearing all about the promises of good "clean" coal. Snake oil, anyone?
3287 2018-08-21 17:35:19 Blaming dead wife for killing own daughters is very chicken-s--t.
Evidence will tell..
How cold to put  own little girls' bodies in crude oil tank!
Probably wife was too big to fit in oil tank.
Just what he did with bodies  alone is awful and his own fam too!
3288 2018-08-21 17:35:11 Y’all really pay for an oil change instead of just buying the oil and the filter?
3289 2018-08-21 17:35:11 your a total joke

3293 2018-08-21 17:34:39 Under the influence, yes, I'm talking about purchase and use specifically. Both are legal for alcohol and narcotic pain meds. I'm not talking about running around vaping thc oil and waving my gun around like Yosemite Sam, SMH.

3296 2018-08-21 17:34:16 Yet as you pointed out, the ratio of state ownership of capital was very high even before Norway developed its oil reservoir.
3297 2018-08-21 17:33:58 you don't need to agree with every figure of speech... not a solo assertion it's a slap to that commi bastard where he's trying to demean India. UAE, a tiny state of course never gonna match India's budget even now when Oil fuels economies worldwide& future is of post-oil economy
3298 2018-08-21 17:33:47 Honestly there are two types of people - the ones who are racists at heart and attack @ManCity because of Arab owner and oil money - or they are jealous and use that as a way to consolidate their love for their clubs and their clubs repeated failures.

3303 2018-08-21 17:33:16 Funny, we never asked these question 16 years ago when we sent the troops to secure Iraqi oil.. Or when the lastest Tax scam was signed.. 

Oh, also the Koch brothers latest study showes Medicare 4 all, saves US citizens 2T over current health care system for the same coverage.

Then solving those are crucial in dealing with those hypocrisy, and making them less hypocritical.
Why mention them otherwise?
3307 2018-08-21 17:32:40 Not in my house. Tablespoon of sesame oil, fresh garlic, salt, pepper, lil’ bit of fresh chilli, seal with lid on for 5, add in half a cup of proper chicken stock, simmer for 5 mins, still crunchy, you’re welcome.  #chefsdaughter
3308 2018-08-21 17:32:39 i want cicero to oil my body not in a sexual way my skin is just kinda dry rn and i cant be bothered
3309 2018-08-21 17:32:33 You need to end oil production in CA or else this is just posturing. 

Oh wait...
3310 2018-08-21 17:32:22 Keep going with the tea tre oil and salt water rinses. I got my tragus pierced and did it consistently for a few weeks along with changing the the earring more frequently and mine went away completely.
3311 2018-08-21 17:32:16 There’s substantial evidence they don’t work. None of them. All equally snake oil. Snake oil prescribed by doctors. I rec checking out @LindaBaconHAES for more info on the science.

3314 2018-08-21 17:31:57 This is the stupidest food-related claim I've ever heard. It's just pushed Gaylord Hauser's mineral oil salad dressing off the table and down the steps.

3316 2018-08-21 17:31:45 You mean the place that was sanctioned to hell and back, overly reliant on oil....
3317 2018-08-21 17:31:41 A binary choice? Oil is not going away anytime soon and pipes still need to be replaced to maintain their safety and reliability. Without the pipe all these products would turn to rail which still has tracks along rivers and lakes. Oil displaces food from rails too
3318 2018-08-21 17:31:33 Canada should have been using its oil reserves to fund its rise onto the world stage as a clean energy produce and technological power. Instead feuding liberals and conservatives have prevented real progress, preferring to engage in partisan politics and sell off public assets.
3319 2018-08-21 17:31:16 Imagine if the BP Oil Spill happened during the Twitter era .. They would’ve had BP shut tf down by the end of the week LMFAOOOOOO 
3320 2018-08-21 17:31:10 Rubbish! Countries in Asia such as India, Thailand, Malaysia and Sri Lanka have consumed coconut oil for centuries and have lived long and healthy lives.
3321 2018-08-21 17:31:05 Hopefully this "short list" has a secret recreational #cannabis stash somewhere for recreational, because we keep hearing from #patients the #LP'S frequently run out of #strains and also #CBD oil. Obviously many more growers will need to come on board to supply the public.

3325 2018-08-21 17:30:17 Seriously why is this oil change taking so long
3326 2018-08-21 17:30:16 He’s lost all credibility. He wouldn’t have lied to the media if this was the case. And he would have called the cops and not dumped them in oil canisters
3327 2018-08-21 17:30:01 another weird thing about this argument is USA is an oil rich nation. So if that's all it takes...
3328 2018-08-21 17:29:40 So..I’m tuned into Queen Radio while getting an oil change for my car. @nickiminaj is making excellent points on her show. I feel a little badly for not understanding her before. #queenradio
3329 2018-08-21 17:29:33 Saudi Arabia is a bad player in the world just like Putin and Nk leader. If Saudi didn't have so much oil and money, would we or the UK play so nice? All the more reason for getting off the oil addiction.
3330 2018-08-21 17:29:28 @jasonmyrt Food Nane: Borscht, sounds like motor oil or something. Contains lots of vitamins and dietary nitrate though. That stiffin you up Jay
3331 2018-08-21 17:29:27 Yes, it's Value Added....a Cumulative % every year...it's +ve ....even if it's ZERO for India, it'll still save you from Deficits ! Balance of Payments for India is most distorted for Electronic Imports. If you just make your OWN & don't export, you'll NOT face deficit for OIL.
3332 2018-08-21 17:29:21 Not likely, sir. Rep. Buehler voted against the Clean Fuels Standard. He voted to keep us addicted to foreign oil instead of using cleaner, cheaper fuels made close to home. He voted against the growing fuels economy in Oregon. He has no vision.
3333 2018-08-21 17:29:18 9 years you say, so about the same time the oil money started coming in. Hmmmmm I wonder if maybe it was Chelsea before that.
3334 2018-08-21 17:29:12 it's not ballsy it's call fool..n now china buy palm oil from Indonesia
3335 2018-08-21 17:29:08 oil
3336 2018-08-21 17:28:54 Hydrocarbons are approximately 20%-30% of the national income and wealth in Norway, hardly any oil&gas in the four other Nordic countries.
3337 2018-08-21 17:28:51 Laxi hair food available at Pep. I mix it with coconut oil.
3338 2018-08-21 17:28:49 Melanin is not crude oil, it’s an organic protein. All people have melonin in their bodies and Most crude oil is not even black.
3339 2018-08-21 17:28:44 Went the spa today had a sauna, a Turkish bath, full body scrub, foam massage, face mask and a 40 min full body oil massage. Feel like a new bloody woman 
3340 2018-08-21 17:28:41 I live in Washington State, we have not seen the sky in days, every year we have a new record high. Meanwhile, on the East Coast there are new record lows every winter. I understand that GOP are oil/gas company pawns, but unless we do something drastic, we won’t recover.

3346 2018-08-21 17:28:10 Exactly!!!!!! Let’s say she did kill her kids (which I don’t believe she did) how does a sorrowful loving father dump their bodies in an oil tank.
3347 2018-08-21 17:27:18 I’m so grateful for it all. Y’all getting us the spray & Oil?
3348 2018-08-21 17:27:00 It makes more sense in my head to do oil last. I’ve noticed I tend to get more moisture when I LCO instead of LOC.
3349 2018-08-21 17:26:48 Castor Oil and Tea Tree oil Babes...save dem ting miss! Lmao
3350 2018-08-21 17:26:45 We miss you here in Edmonton Nail...wishing you all the best.. it was fun watching you play here in Oil Country.
3351 2018-08-21 17:26:35 If he was so enraged with her because she killed the kids (which I do not at all believe), why not dump *her* body in an oil tank and at least bury his daughters somewhat respectfully?
3352 2018-08-21 17:26:19 Because they have oil.
3353 2018-08-21 17:26:18 As opposed to being a party of white pride, anti Muslim, anti gay, anti immigration, anti environment, pro oil, pro Saudi influence, pro multi national ownership of Canadian assets. @JustinTrudeau represented Canada as a true leader
3354 2018-08-21 17:26:12 Not if you put vegetable oil in
3355 2018-08-21 17:26:07 told my mom i don’t like eating out at vegan restaurants because most of them use coconut or coconut oil in a lot of their products, and i said “and i’m not tryna die!” and she seemed genuinely shocked when she said “you’re not?”, guess that’s how i know i joke abt dying too much
3356 2018-08-21 17:26:03 I actually just ate avocado toast... basic avocado toast - salt, pepper, olive oil, lemon juice... it was actually pretty good! I’m shocked. Fear of green mushy foods might be going away. 
3357 2018-08-21 17:26:01 He doesn't give a shit about birds anyway; just the money he gets from the oil industry.
3358 2018-08-21 17:25:52 With the make up of earth and no take tonic plates. It is 99.99% of no earthquakes. The land formations don't shift. Just up and down when water and oil is taken out for example. All man made. Pretty solid.
3359 2018-08-21 17:25:44 If one more client asks me about CBD oil for their dogs today 
3360 2018-08-21 17:25:43 Coconut oil the plate .
3361 2018-08-21 17:25:30 They will be more interested in Crude oil Sir...
3362 2018-08-21 17:25:27 Many of the recent wars have been over oil. Big profits. Notice no one's fighting to save oppressed people in central Africa.
3363 2018-08-21 17:25:21 Their meat-pipe slathered in lamp oil/kerosene wedged into their cum dumpster
3364 2018-08-21 17:25:21 There also reports about certain sabotage of their oil industry. Some North American companies trying edge them out by making it hard to sell their oil. I agree on the leadership part and failure to create other industries.
3365 2018-08-21 17:25:16 Clean power is only more expensive because oil is subsidized. It has also had decades of funding for development. If clean energy was given some funding to develop (like Obama did) we could have new ideas and startups that would create jobs and #cleanenergy.
3366 2018-08-21 17:25:06 今日台風の影響か、気温上がって寝苦しいですよね。毎日お疲れ様です。
3367 2018-08-21 17:25:02 So NOW under YOU & 45

you rolled back safety regs on air & H2O
  (Flint still doesn’t have safe H2O either)
you rolled back SAFETY regs on oil platforms
   (Don’t care about gulf or ppl)
want to reduce banking regs as well

GUESS @GOP BIG MONEY doesn’t care about US
3368 2018-08-21 17:24:54 TY but, World is beginning to Burn, literally. We as Species must make some dramatic changes to our collective behaviors immediately. 
Use of Oil to fuel our industries must cease, the pollution resulting from has induced extreme #climatechange accelerating such, threatens us all
3369 2018-08-21 17:24:48 Key words here are "with her voters". Her voters are NDP'ers who do not represent the values of most Albertans. She is supposed to be the MP for ALL residents in her riding, not just the crazies that are trying to destroy Alberta's oil and gas industry
3370 2018-08-21 17:24:38 Well, he is the Democratic nominee for Governor, would you prefer he back the Republican? Many Democrats, including myself, voted for him to represent our party. Just because he is a billionaire with oil ties does not automatically make him the enemy or suspect.
3371 2018-08-21 17:24:30 Lol they should use the beard oil then and get it together!!!
3372 2018-08-21 17:24:04 *Oil change guy pulls up my truck*
Him: does your gas gage work?
Me: yeah???
Him: oh so it’s just..really low
Me: oh yeah, probably
3373 2018-08-21 17:23:50 In fairness, I don't think you get to pick only the "socialist" success stories and discount the failures like Venezuela.  Venezuela nationalized its oil reserves and greatly expanded the social/welfare state and is not a hellhole.  That clearly contributed to its collapse.
3374 2018-08-21 17:23:29 Look I'm still waiting on my oil change to be finished BUT MY STOMACH WILL NOT STOP GROWLING I AM @DEAD SEND HELP
3375 2018-08-21 17:23:24 I lost my chapstick so I’ve been using my CBD oil to moisturize my lips 
3376 2018-08-21 17:23:07 "Ausgezeichnet?" New fav word doesn't describe yesterday. Slipped & fell in puddle in car dealership; 1st oil change brought new meaning to customer service. Rest of day in hospital getting checked. No forms for accident report -- unglaublich! #IHateMondays #CUSTOMERSERVICEFAIL
3377 2018-08-21 17:22:56 canola oil annoys me so bad
3378 2018-08-21 17:22:45 Has he tried cannabis oil? I don’t know what the laws are where you live, but CBD (illegal here, but a family member has some connections) did something to my grandmother’s metastasis when she stopped her treatment.
3379 2018-08-21 17:22:41 yo man..najib made a fair trade..ecrl goes on n china must buy palm oil in large quantity from Malaysia..najib is more brilliant than tun m

tun m just make him look stupid been rejected by Chinese pm..hahah
3380 2018-08-21 17:22:29 Cruiselines were down due to rising oil and rising dollar. Plus capacity concerns.

3383 2018-08-21 17:21:48 Instablog and shaderoom commenters are rude af!! Someone called Camilla cabello 'canola oil'. 
3384 2018-08-21 17:21:40 This lady extra oil and vinegar on her Publix sub and then got mad because her bread was soggy . That’s your fault!!
3385 2018-08-21 17:21:25 Once again Scottish comedy and  tourism getting stronger with out oil and gas
3386 2018-08-21 17:21:18 lol
No, I'm a degree-less rural Albertan working in the oil field.

Yet I'm still capable of understanding that people who work for years getting an education want an entry level position that's in their field.
3387 2018-08-21 17:21:03 1.Masage your scalp with coconut oil or castor oil
2.Avoid using heat on your hair 
3.If you have split ends go to the salon and trim them not your hair
4.If your using heat always and always wear a heat protector before using heat on your hair
3388 2018-08-21 17:21:02 What do the US want from Russia about Syria, 
To let the US forces attack populations as they do in other countries like Yemen?
To stop humanitarian help?
To allow the US to steal their oil? This is unbelievable and more to see the media supporting that position
3389 2018-08-21 17:21:01  should I bring you palm oil?
3390 2018-08-21 17:20:54 So let's deconstruct this, because it's obvious he was talking about terrorist attacks on infrastructure (based upon his comment about blowing up an oil line). 
If a terrorist wanted to take out our supply of coal, they could sabotage:
-(rail)roads
-mine loaders
-trucks
-mines
3391 2018-08-21 17:20:52 The movie "Black Panther" is a forseen story of the Biafran nation. They are the youngest nation in the world with rapid development and technological advancement. If oil is the reason of not letting us be, let them come drill it all and see what happens next.
3392 2018-08-21 17:20:47 patriarchy, oxidized vegetable oil and cynical misdirection in one tweet...what more could a girl wish for?
3393 2018-08-21 17:20:35 It’s really sad, the British people were conned by a disparate bunch of used car salesmen peddling snake oil.
Now, feeling like all victims of a con, they find it difficult to accept that they were take for a ride. Counselling is available!
3394 2018-08-21 17:20:35 Toss them with olive oil and sea salt (or kosher) and roast them.  Heck, even CABBAGE tastes good that way!
3395 2018-08-21 17:20:35 Kim has been keeping me updated on this, beyond disgusting what they’re doing to these animals to produce palm oil whatever that is
3396 2018-08-21 17:20:34 What is happening to the oil and natural gas  that is being fracked.  Being sold overseas?  Not helping to support the energy needs of America and protecting our future needs.  Not to mention the pollution of ground water for millions of people.
3397 2018-08-21 17:20:29 諦めない限りクツオ氏が見捨てないので実質諦める理由がないのだなぁ………(にわとりとたまご)
3398 2018-08-21 17:20:26 RBS UK paid OIL costs more to produce than it's sold for UK pays just 2
3399 2018-08-21 17:20:16 Is the issue here that these products are snake oil meaning that if they were selling more legitimate products like blue apron, me undees, Harry’s razors or even hair loss and ED pills than there wouldn’t be an issue? Cause I hear those adds all the time on more left leaningshows
3400 2018-08-21 17:20:09 You got to be kidding me.
3401 2018-08-21 17:20:04 @SpeakerRyan doesn’t seem to Care About His Constituents at All! He Passed his Tax Scam & Gave Big Oil Companies BIG Tax Breaks to Poison the Environment!

3403 2018-08-21 17:19:35 And do I have my travel size coconut oil packets from TJ’s? Nope. 

I’ve failed my ancestors. And my grandmothers.
3404 2018-08-21 17:19:32 Before they could pour the  Foundations they brought in to mobile cement factories which required oil for their transport

Then cement trucks using oil poured the foundations

The transmission lines had to be built which were placed underground by giant ditch witches using oil
3405 2018-08-21 17:19:20 We are very close to a tipping point that will undermine the oil industry’s grip on the economy. Buy EV’s people!!!
3406 2018-08-21 17:19:19 What happened to the much acclaimed scientific formula by the COTU bull and political snake oil businessman to pick the Luhya tribal political chief?... let's admit Luhya unity is a pipedream...if the intent is to select a kingpin then it's the silliest of the charades..
3407 2018-08-21 17:19:18 yea the earth is warming because we keep abusing mother earth people are fracking and people are taking oil outof the earth. how much do humans think the earth can take?it common sense humans are not replenishing what they take from theearth therefore theearth will probablimplode

3426 2018-08-21 17:17:44 Coal ash is used in cement which is used for the foundation of a wind tower

 Before they could build a 72 tower wind farm that was built within 5 miles of me

 They had to build roads and clear areas for the towers that required bulldozers They use oil
3427 2018-08-21 17:17:30 I am reminded of Claudia Rose's who asking a Spanish food expert if any vestige of Jewish cooking could be found in Spain was told yes. The way we cook suckling pig in oil instead of in milk.

3435 2018-08-21 17:16:25 Sure explain to me how you build a wind power or solar panel without the use of fossil fuels

They're required for mining transportation of the raw materials

Germanium which is used in chips comes out of coal 

Wind tower blades are made from polymer resins which comes from oil

3450 2018-08-21 17:14:30 Hi Clodagh, sorry to hear! The Mousse has a sticky feeling compared to the oil because there is extra natural ingredients in it to achieve a darker colour. If you try only putting a small layer on at a time the stickiness should not be that bad! xxx

3482 2018-08-21 17:11:07 Well in life we sometimes have to go through hard times to get to better ones. We had Nissan build a plant and never opened under bathhouse Barry so there’s that. Oil and fracing is booming all over, things change and people migrate where the work is. Funny how you think it was
3483 2018-08-21 17:10:57 didn't Maduro also try and back the currency with Crypto that was backed by oil? Is our media ever going to cover the collapse of this once vibrant oil rich country?

3485 2018-08-21 17:10:36 So let me get this straight,- the Colorado husband / father takes the time to BURY the EVIL wife who killed their two daughters, but he DUMPS the bodies of his LOVING daughters in an oil tanker!
3486 2018-08-21 17:10:28 I doubt that’ll show anything since he submerged them all in oil ....it’s all really awful

3488 2018-08-21 17:10:24 Salmond wanted Scotland to be the European Venezuela look how that is !!!! It has the highest oil reserves in the world and is a socialist state so would u want Indy if it lead to this

3492 2018-08-21 17:10:06 Governor Brown...When will you stop playing both sides? Offshore drilling of the California coast and infrastructure used in Oil Exploration and the expansion of fracking and storage of the poisonous byproducts of fracking in CA have increased under your watch.
3493 2018-08-21 17:10:04 EXACTLY! I did the salt water, tea tree oil. Nothing worked. I think it’s just your body rejecting the piercing.
3494 2018-08-21 17:10:02 Coconut oil is great if you have naturally curly hair, especially in the winter. Use a small amount when your hair is wet a work it in from the ends up. It’s also good for dry skin and for dry lips. I’ve never used it for cooking.
3495 2018-08-21 17:09:31 Idk if that is entirely truthful. The documentary was made by Naomi Klein who supported Chavez for upholding democracy. Now I'm not one of those "Chavez was an evil socialist!" people, but nationalization, as he did with oil, is not very democratic.
3496 2018-08-21 17:09:29 And this labour’s worthy of my higher.

3502 2018-08-21 17:08:38 Hi Ian. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks
3503 2018-08-21 17:08:32 currently gray and smoked filled, they did reduce poverty, the lowering of oil prices and the failure to diversify the economy have certainly left Venezuela in turmoil, but nationalizing the energy sector isn't the cause of their problems
3504 2018-08-21 17:08:28 A little spritz of something non-irritating like peppermint oil is nice once in a while, but Jesus the caustic clouds of Tea Tree that my co-workers emit from their desks are just horrid.

3506 2018-08-21 17:08:18 Wow!  Looks like an oil painting.
3507 2018-08-21 17:08:17 Every time socialism fails the intellectuals give us their genius excuse “that wasn’t true socialism.” You see, Venezuela did indeed try ‘true’ socialism and that is precisely why it failed so miserably. The most oil reserves on the planet and their people are “equally” starving
3508 2018-08-21 17:08:12 Thug capitalism doing its dirty work on a socialist country. Main goal is to steal Venezuela's oil. With psychopathic baboons running the "free" world we are all doomed.

3512 2018-08-21 17:07:33 Incorrect it's soy or palm oil
3513 2018-08-21 17:07:26 You know how sometimes you're going about your business when suddenly a pint of motor oil spills all over the tiles in your laundry room, and you have to burn the house down?

3517 2018-08-21 17:07:12 Ok, but like why aren’t all of the plants thriving off of all the co2? What happens when the run out if oil? Are there electric cars? How were they born? Why are there plants but not animals?

3519 2018-08-21 17:07:00 Introvert’s day off = oil change, car wash, Costco run, laundry, and interacting with the fewest humans and speaking absolutely the fewest words possible.
3520 2018-08-21 17:06:47 The dems are so old they were still using oil lamps and riding horse and buggies! Polosi could crush that sissy with one arm. What's he wiegh? 36lbs!

3522 2018-08-21 17:06:31 Where does Ireland get the #gas and #oil it needs? In 2016, Corrib and Kinsale supplied 59% of Ireland's natural gas while 100% of oil was imported. By 2026, if no more Irish gas or oil fields are found and developed, 79% of gas and 100% of oil will be imported foreign supplies

3526 2018-08-21 17:05:54 Lately a lot of people say CBD oil is a trend. The reality is that hemp products, including medicine, have been used since before the founding of our country. Thanks to outdated laws, and FDA regulations, CBD oil cannot be marketed like other healthcare products are.
3527 2018-08-21 17:05:49 So how did they get in the oil tank?
3528 2018-08-21 17:05:47 Of course I splashed hot oil on my hand and wrist 
3529 2018-08-21 17:05:45 @MidSportsMedia hi Dave, I have a question about the fuel the bikes use, back in the 80s it smelt like Castrol r , I know the bikes use methanol now, do they mix any oil with the methanol?? Any help would be great 
3530 2018-08-21 17:05:33 Infrequent oil changes means your oil is breaking down and not protecting your engine as it should. One of the by-products of old and dirty oil is the accumulation of sludge in the crankcase, which can cause even more damage.
3531 2018-08-21 17:05:25 Of course, you exclude Avocado, Olives and coconut (oil) because you're talking about Carnivore, but from a health point of view, any cons about them? I mean carnivore + some (1/week) of those fruits
3532 2018-08-21 17:05:10 Stop the KM pipeline and watch Jason Kenney gain votes while Notley loses votes. Do you look forward to advancing climate action with him in the Alberta Premier's chair? Don't make the perfect the enemy of the good.
In the meantime, do all you can to reduce oil demand.

3535 2018-08-21 17:05:05 As the school year is beginning and you’re buying dish soap for your house/apt, go ahead and buy that Dawn dish soap. It may cost a few cents more than the off-brand, but that money goes toward cleaning animals affected by oil spills, etc.

And we kinda owe it to the wildlife 
3536 2018-08-21 17:05:05 That look like high quality toys covered in Olive oil
3537 2018-08-21 17:04:59 This man says he went into a “rage” after his wife supposedly strangled their kids but yet he put HIS children in oil tanks..I’m gonna have to call bullshit and you my friend are a MONSTER
3538 2018-08-21 17:04:56 Can I still use coconut oil on my dry-ass skin?
3539 2018-08-21 17:04:55 You know I really want to know if they’re actually sweaty or if they put baby oil on them lmaoo
3540 2018-08-21 17:04:54 I’d kind of rather he was humiliated, and made to see pics of his babies bodies before and after cleansing the oil from them, and his wife with her baby bump. Line his cell walls with them.
3541 2018-08-21 17:04:50 Venezuela had inflation of 83% in 1989 with Austerity-practicing Jaime Lusinchi as president.
As a Petro-state Venezuela’s fate rests entirely on oil prices - as you well know.

3561 2018-08-21 17:02:29 Venezuela has been under economic attack by the US for years. That’s what we do to countries we don’t like. Every report says “Venezuela is oil rich but cash poor.” How do you think that happens? Maybe bc oil is bought and sold with USD and America controls the Petrodollar?

3618 2018-08-21 16:55:51 My young son is practicing for parenthood. Terrible puns. They all finish with a wink and “...do you get it?”

Today watching Stranger Things with me:   “Well that scene was _strange_ ....do you get it!” *wink*

Cooking dinner. Mr 12: “Oil set the table... do you get it - _oil_“
3619 2018-08-21 16:55:46 Oil stocks will crash in this weekend. Not exactly.　　石油株は今週末に暴落するだろう。いや、そうでもないよ。
3620 2018-08-21 16:55:46 I put rosemary oil on my pillow and it helped me fall asleep 
3621 2018-08-21 16:55:44 Yum. Puree with some garlic, cumin, a little olive oil and add some chopped fresh tomato... a great spread or veggie dip.
3622 2018-08-21 16:55:36 Very cool. What is “oil pull”?
3623 2018-08-21 16:55:22 Katy will spend the winnings on crochet patterns and oil lamp polish #TheChase
3624 2018-08-21 16:55:13 Getting my oil change and they telling me shit about my car. I’m like,”Yeah.... okay.” and I have NOOOOOOO idea wtf they talking about

I'm more convinced Americans are interfering in Canadian oil than I am that Russians got Trump elected
3627 2018-08-21 16:54:58 task one complete ... currently washing clothes . about to drop my car off for the oil change .
3628 2018-08-21 16:54:50 Put tea tree oil on it and it’ll clear it up either way :-)
3629 2018-08-21 16:54:50 Lay yo hair down on me baby, coconut oil on my grey tee. But it’s cool, cause it’s you
3630 2018-08-21 16:54:43 I need tea tree oil 
3631 2018-08-21 16:54:25 Instead of comparing GDP, debt and income of both countries moron Veni is comparing geography. UAE survives and rules through oil and most malyalis work there. Comparing Indian funds with UAE is downright foolish. Speaks much abt the intelligent quotient of Commies.

3633 2018-08-21 16:54:07 It’s expensive but I do deep tissue massage (w hot stones if I can spring for it) when it gets unbearable/I’m in tears. recently gotten into at-home cupping via my roomie and it’s helped. Massaging the area with coconut oil and a few drops of peppermint oil before bed also helps

3635 2018-08-21 16:53:49 At least the money would be generated for Canada. Royalties, taxes, etc will pay for a lot of health care, schools, infrastructure and innovation. The foreign oil is not subject to any regulatory reviews or standards.
3636 2018-08-21 16:53:47 Some woman at the beach today was using extra virgin olive oil to tan with.... I don’t know whether to commend her efforts for that tan or be worried for her

3638 2018-08-21 16:53:15 Get a ticket for registration being out. Go get the oil changed and inspected so I can renew registration, then the car breaks down. 2 days later my wife’s car breaks down after passing inspection... #fademe #atleastihavecomics #mentalbreakdown
3639 2018-08-21 16:53:13 And by keep trying I don't mean ditching what you're currently doing.  If a Rife machine AND zapper AND flaxseed oil AND healthier diet etc. aren't working, there's no reason to give up on those if  you for example decide to try Essiac tea...
3640 2018-08-21 16:52:59 If coconut oil is "pure poison," margarine is nerve agent.
3641 2018-08-21 16:52:59 My second oil vendor doesn’t do Twitter again which means I have to be talking on the phone. Oh the anxiety 
3642 2018-08-21 16:52:55 As a Leeds fan you have a valid point, as I’ve said myself numerous times. However up until oil money your history was similar if not slightly worse than ours. One thing I think is certain though, our fans are a million times better than yours now. Success = plastic fans.
3643 2018-08-21 16:52:42 Brown's "legacy" is garbage and threatens our future on the planet. 
Btw, is he still looking for oil on his ranch these days?
3644 2018-08-21 16:52:39 Seeing him change the brakes, do an oil change, and re-floor the living room, not because he can’t afford to get a professional but because he loves working with his hands, is literally the sexiest thing. IDC... IDC, it’s everything!
3645 2018-08-21 16:52:31 Suppose to just soften it and whatever lol. Like normal oil used in  hair.
3646 2018-08-21 16:52:24 Oily oilという言葉が存在するとしたらoilyじゃないoilも存在するという矛盾を抱える(´･ω･｀)

3650 2018-08-21 16:52:04 @IndianOilcl Sir,we are at Indian oil petrol pump at yamuna express way one the way to Agra from greater moods,behavior of staff is rude and no one is available for filling cng,after 25 mins guy came to fill-up cng.

It's the new coconut oil
3653 2018-08-21 16:51:48 Do you do a 'Thieves' , or '4 Thieves' oil blend?
3654 2018-08-21 16:51:48 Now, does @RealDonaldTrump know about the oil subsidies taxpayers pay for each year?
3655 2018-08-21 16:51:46 Want to compare to Arab countries that hadn't fallen victim to the classical blunder of getting involved in a land war with Israel? Well, we have Yemen (GDP per capita $ 1,300, was ~ $ 4,500 pre-civil war) and Libya ($ 10,000 now, was ~ $29,500, but quite a bit of that was oil).
3656 2018-08-21 16:51:41 Yayie! @justjigar has bought me my colourful pencils. Someone else has offered oil pastel colours! Yayiee! 
3657 2018-08-21 16:51:41 Was all ready to stand my ground getting an oil change and respond with “well I’m not buying it” when they told me all the things they think I should buy. Then the guy went, “bro you need a new car” and I said hesitantly well I’m not buying it.

3660 2018-08-21 16:51:17 If you have kids and are sane, you wouldn't dump them in oil tanks. You'd do everything to save them. If anything you'd keep them in your house as you wouldn't want them to be taken away to be buried. He definitely killed them and attempted to get away with it.
3661 2018-08-21 16:51:13 Over 20k oil & gas wells were approved under CA @JerryBrownGov's tenure. 77% of these permits issued, since Brown took office, are in communities w/above-average poverty rates, while 67% are in communities of color
Is this what climate leadership looks like?

3667 2018-08-21 16:50:22 It works well as a cheap beard oil :)
3668 2018-08-21 16:50:20 A  lot the coal-fired plants could not convert over to natural gas or oil. Thus increasing the cost of energy taking more money out of our wallets.
3669 2018-08-21 16:50:11 If that were true then you could justify the murder, but the fact that he lied all that time and put the kids in oil tanks instead of proper burial proves this guy is a lying shit.

3672 2018-08-21 16:49:34 Chris watts is trying to murder his wife all over again with his lies! She loved her kids so much and he is trying to say he caught her strangeling one so he killed the pregnant wife and then dumped his daughters bodies in a oil tank and acted like a grieving husband and father?
3673 2018-08-21 16:49:27 And Obama’s & Bill’s wallets are FAT thanks to the American people. God bless America right!? Community organizer to Multi millionaire. Clinton foundation, scam, only donated a small %. They kept the rest. Bush is fat from oil.

3677 2018-08-21 16:49:10 Okay but fun fact potatoes are gross unless they are fried in oil.
3678 2018-08-21 16:49:06 The crippling impact of fuel subsidy on oil revenue and on the larger economy.

3690 2018-08-21 16:48:26 All the workers will die when they can't breathe or drink clean water. Maybe we should transition to sustainable energy production. Solar? Didn't you take plenty of money from the oil and gas industry?

3697 2018-08-21 16:47:44 Isaac & I had been talking since last week.  He had a 2010 Toyota Tundra SR5 but has been wanting to upgrade.  He was in service a few weeks ago.  While we waited for his oil change he saw this pre-owned 2017 Toyota Certified Platinum Tundra with only 2200 miles on it .

3703 2018-08-21 16:46:54 People here in my island nation used Coconut oil for various purposes, many 1000s years (With 2000 years’ written history); including food preparation. How many years Ivy League or even Oxbridge existed? 
3704 2018-08-21 16:46:52 Snake oil salesmen never liked to be called snake oil salesman. They like to be called by intellectual terms like, entrepreneurs. 
3705 2018-08-21 16:46:44 He lied and acted like they were missing and stuffed their bodies into oil containers. He's a liar and a murderer.

3710 2018-08-21 16:46:14 Been watching Vice on HBO since season one. Top quality journalism. Always on top of the best stories that nobody reports.

Their piece on the 'cold war' over oil reserves near the north pole was an eye-opener.

Has anyone determined by #lab analysis the saturation point of #THC/#CBD infusion in butter and/or plant-based cooking oil?
1oz/1lb dry flower to butter seems to be the consensus but doesn't answer mg/g max solution.
3714 2018-08-21 16:45:56 While we’re bringing back coal, I think we should also bring back whale oil lanterns and rotary phones.
3715 2018-08-21 16:45:55 This is not a good idea. Eric said it plain as day at the end. Afghanistan has rare earth materials the US needs.  Same in Iraq. We were not there for WMDs we were there to keep the oil safe. We do need to do something but sending private contractors over funded by USA, pointless
3716 2018-08-21 16:45:55 It's easy to stay meatless or dairyless that's nothing it's finding soy or canola oil in everything

3720 2018-08-21 16:45:31 The hypocrisy of #JerryBrown's statement when he is backing #AB813, a bill that hands over CA's electricity grid to the Trump administration & just yesterday had four activists arrested for protesting Brown's expansion of oil drilling in #CA, is simply amazing. #BrownsLastChance

3722 2018-08-21 16:45:15 I’m pretty sure it was done with his hands. So, if the oil or other materials didn’t damage the body too much, I bet they could match the marks on the neck to the fingers. I’m almost 100% sure they won’t match hers. Women, typically, don’t strangle.
3723 2018-08-21 16:45:14 Looking at the schedule, we have a few openings for this week...do you need an alignment? Brakes? Check engine light? Front end work? Tires? Air conditioner work? Oil Change? Tire rotation? We can help! Give us a call! 785-336-2828
3724 2018-08-21 16:45:06 Hey, John.  Think there's a link between our out of control fire season and all that natural gas we give away to big oil companies?  Why don't you talk more about climate change?  @bcndp
3725 2018-08-21 16:45:01 That’s a bull shit excuse bc if she did kill your kids, why would you put them in oil canisters!? 
3726 2018-08-21 16:44:57 "the Obama war on coal." That's rich. If there is a war on coal it comes from the oil and gas industries, and you know it. It's just a happy coincidence that the polluting fuels of fossils have taken down the damaging black dust of coal. Are all congresspeople useless tools?
3727 2018-08-21 16:44:56 and probably "to do something" against the collapse, they take parts of Iran for US-bases and those places will be where the oil is..
3728 2018-08-21 16:44:51 It’s supposed to be good cholesterol in coconut oil

3734 2018-08-21 16:44:12 But they have so many methed out folks who get hit hard when the price of oil goes down.
3735 2018-08-21 16:44:05 So do you have investments in oil and pipelines? Take a poll.
We need to move toward clean energy

3740 2018-08-21 16:43:37 It looks like an oil spill 
3741 2018-08-21 16:43:32 I do not see the humour - Canadians are the most indebted people on the planet - so far Justin has offended China who cancelled their oil contracts - took a terrorist to dinner in India thus no trade deal - My God - he managed to offend Japan (dude that is hard to do).
3742 2018-08-21 16:43:29 Body oil gel is amazing
3743 2018-08-21 16:43:28 And I can safely bet that he is employed in the oil industry...
3744 2018-08-21 16:43:28 We buy more oil from Canada than anywhere. And the pipeline being built from Texas to Canada is happening under the eminent domain act lol for oil. Free trade is the only way we can survive. Russsi has taking over LNG. it's cheap and ours is expensive. Nobody wants to buy
3745 2018-08-21 16:43:23 You apply it similarly to begloss. With vivishine you need water. With silicone oil and begloss and other silicone products like swiss navy you don't.
3746 2018-08-21 16:43:16 as you may know i am ill at the moment will IBD colitis i was just wondering

3747 2018-08-21 16:43:09 Happy time murders advertised right under the story of Mollie Tibbett’s body being found.  Right above the story of a woman and her two daughters’ bodies found submerged in crude oil.

Hollywood put a f*cking leash on your perversion of sensibilities.
3748 2018-08-21 16:42:36 Why would people want to use Delhi Oil as the back drop for a movie scene?
3749 2018-08-21 16:42:27 True, but to back a billionaire with ties to oil is pretty republican.
3750 2018-08-21 16:42:11 Coal is dead McConnell. Your old man view of the world is too. Serve Kentucky by modernizing education and training for the future, not trying to preserve an energy source that is helping to kill the planet. But we know your loyalty is to coal and oil producers, including Russia.
3751 2018-08-21 16:42:10 Olive oil and lots of garlic.
3752 2018-08-21 16:42:06 Paul Ryan sucks, so does Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Devin Nunes. These conservatives all support the interest of big business, like the NRA and big oil, not people.  Instead of bad-mouthing the old, target corruption and greed.
3753 2018-08-21 16:41:56 The people making money from coconut oil haven't paid anything to this professor.  Pay him and that oil will become the best thing ever to consume.
3754 2018-08-21 16:41:43 Sri Lanka's economy has been in the doldrums. We're facing challenges which makes investors worry. Issues like trade war, oil price rise, currency depreciation, elections, rising current account deficit. I do not have a clue how these macro factors will play out in the near term
3755 2018-08-21 16:41:29 My daily routine is mildly oil, shampoo, protein, conditioner, serum, blow dry, iron 
3756 2018-08-21 16:41:21 They have the biggest oil reserves but other than that the Western nations are intentionally sabotaging the economy
3757 2018-08-21 16:41:19 Take a poll. We need to move away from coal and oil toward clean energy.
3758 2018-08-21 16:41:18 We're not all that fond of Big Oil either. Hooray for #electricbuses!

3760 2018-08-21 16:41:07 Obama did not regulate oil refineries when he could, he wasn’t good on climate change.
3761 2018-08-21 16:40:58 And it about oil. China is the biggest oil importer in the world. They want to use the yuan backed by gold to buy. Saudi Russia and other countries are on board. That would kill the $ as currency to the world. This is why he wants complete renegotiation on tariffs. And nafta.
3762 2018-08-21 16:40:57 Right, this comes after he gives an interview pretending they disappeared but he had inserted his children’s dead bodies into a barrel filled with crude oil less than 48 hours before that interview.

3764 2018-08-21 16:40:50 USA & Socialism are polar opposites.  One is oil, other is vinegar.  They are not compatible.  If u are a Socialist, you do not support the Constitution, which is built upon freedom, liberty & individual rights.  Socialists are usually ignorant or wolves in sheep's clothing.

3779 2018-08-21 16:39:47 @FGSpeedway, gateway, Milwaukee mile, Lucas oil raceway, Iowa, Memphis international raceway, Myrtle Beach, South Boston, Thompson speedway, North Wilkesboro speedway. Those are some of my favorites at least.
3780 2018-08-21 16:39:44 Olive oil is not only easy on the arteries but on the anus as well.
3781 2018-08-21 16:39:05 Yup. But thanks to @slpng_giants , most big $ advertisers now refuse to pollute their brand by associating w/ craven conspiracy theorists. Leaving open spots for snake oil salesmen, who know which shows are watched by members of their target demographic (gullible morons).
3782 2018-08-21 16:39:04 You obviously don't read Variety, Hollywood Reporter or other trade papers. 2018 has been the most stupendous, most profitable year for movies in history. #doyourhomework #enjoylivinginyourcocoon #theworldwillgoonwithoutyou
3783 2018-08-21 16:39:04 But 190+ indictments. 5 guilty pleas and a trial that's about to be concluded.  Yah that's a fake witch hunt.  You follow a snake oil salesmen cult leader wanna be dictator
3784 2018-08-21 16:38:55 Hi @NotYngwie. In 2017, 92% of couples used smartphones to plan their weddings. Many of the phone’s components are made from or with natural gas and oil. $1.8 billion – the approximate amount Americans spent on wedding transportation last year – fueled by petroleum.

Any way to completely opt out of all "news"?
3788 2018-08-21 16:38:04 Super excited to go to Walmart and get necessities for myself, bitch you bet I’m going to re-up on coconut oil.

3796 2018-08-21 16:37:14 LOL he is totally clueless as to what just Bolivarian Venezuela did with that change of currency, linked to its oil reserves instead of the dollar,  and total liberalization of the currency market, plus a shocking minimun-wage raise of 3,000%.
3797 2018-08-21 16:37:12 Dull head Olayinka. Which Petrol will reduce in price? How many new refineries were built 16yrs of PDP in govr? None. With more than $600billion realized from oil sales 16yrs PDP in govt. Do you want petrol to come from heaven? Do you think you are talking to illiterate people?

3800 2018-08-21 16:36:41 We could be using zero gravity to fly, to to space, everything. Yet the Department of Energy holds this technology back so we have to use oil. Disgusting!
3801 2018-08-21 16:36:24 When you have a combination of very strong physical disabilities as I have, and there are no real treatments for them, you value the power of a whole food plant-based no oil low glycemic healthy carb diet.. they are devastatingly debilitating but the diet helps with some of it.
3802 2018-08-21 16:36:21 Even with two years of oil painting under my belt... how does this man do this stuff? What a treasure... what a missed, pure treasure.
3803 2018-08-21 16:36:09 Can Farrage and the Snake Oil salesmen be far behind?
3804 2018-08-21 16:36:00 Keep it simple Olive Oil, lemon, fresh black pepper and like the man @ALLINAK said some Avocado and that’s that
3805 2018-08-21 16:35:52 I think it’s both. He tells lies as he’s hardly turned up to work so he wouldn’t even know how the EU operates apart from his pension. Lies, because he’s a snake oil sales man. It’s what knows best.
3806 2018-08-21 16:35:43 Should be but can't....see we need the foreign investment...hence sasol having to not be such a big player amongst the big giant oil companies
3807 2018-08-21 16:35:34 2. Fraud, because he championed demonetization which is pure economic snake oil. He seems to be consistently associated with ideas that are snake oil. He could be incompetent, but I also think he's smart, so fraud it is.

3810 2018-08-21 16:35:18 Haha thanks! Estrogen and coconut oil do wonders
3811 2018-08-21 16:34:47 Am not a huge fan of the taste of coconut, so I don’t use the oil. I do love a Thai green curry made with coconut milk though.
3812 2018-08-21 16:34:43 My room smells mad good. I need some more oil diffusers.
3813 2018-08-21 16:34:42 Real talk though. I need somebody to oil my scalp.
3814 2018-08-21 16:34:37 OK...so he loved his children SO much that he flipped out when his wife strangled them, and he strangled her. Then he took those precious little girls that he loved SO much and just dumped their bodies in oil tanks. OK??? He is a vile monster!
3815 2018-08-21 16:34:35 Finally got my oil change for my car. #adulting

3817 2018-08-21 16:34:31 U deliberately ignore inconvenient facts that:
- "Clean Power" is much more expensive and would cost Americans much more. 
- IF US does not export OIL coal or gas, Other countries will anyway, and other countries have less environmental regulations and do not enforce them.
3818 2018-08-21 16:34:27 In the restaurant biz, a grill or griddle, is a solid flat surface that you cook on: hamburgers, eggs, pancakes, steaks.  A fryer is where you submerge items in hot oil to cook: battered fish, chips (french fries), fried chicken.  Frying makes food crispy.

3821 2018-08-21 16:34:12 I am not sure what you mean. This happens all the time - there is a reason people leaving top posts in the IC or government goes straight to board positions for major oil companies or geopolitical think tanks. 
They don't get hired because of their good looks.

3823 2018-08-21 16:34:01 We were paying more than twice of what all other countries combined were paying for NATO. That worth repeating. We were paying more than double of everyone else combined so we could help protect them while they made oil deals with those we were protecting them from. Seems legit
3824 2018-08-21 16:33:59 I thought I needed to run and find somebody to love
But all I needed was some coconut oil
3825 2018-08-21 16:33:57 Collateral of petro is not oil. It is a future on the oil from a certain land patch yet to be extracted. And Venezuela constitution forbids futures on oil.
3826 2018-08-21 16:33:57 good time to buy oil Nice price?
3827 2018-08-21 16:33:50 @Asad_Umar  no doubt first chellenge in front of finance minister to reduce dollor value for reducing prices of daily use products .oil etc.

3829 2018-08-21 16:33:37 KAI always cooks really spicy curry with a lot of chili oil to it... It BURNS!;;
3830 2018-08-21 16:33:30 I love the oil and fire mechanism! But what would you even begin the reskinning with here? XD
3831 2018-08-21 16:33:29 #Oil price highest in a week. Good news for #Iran as higher prices compensate for the reduction in the country's export and the unforeseen costs of insurance and transportation to China.
3832 2018-08-21 16:33:28 To blame Russia for this is quite stupid, this type of stuff has been hapening since before the Bush administration and no president has ever spoke a word about the saudi human rights problem becouse how profitable the oil trade with the saudis is.
3833 2018-08-21 16:33:24 It’s too damn expensive to own a car.  now it makes sense why I see y’all walking every where. $200 dollars later and all I came for was an oil change smh
3834 2018-08-21 16:33:23 Tea tree oil and bio oil have worked really good for me :)
3835 2018-08-21 16:33:23 this calming oil blend on my wrist is doing the damn thing!
3836 2018-08-21 16:33:17 That may be it. I filled it last week and the light came on and then went off the next day. Then it came in again this morning. But I decided to have it checked out while I get my oil changed. Hopefully it’s as simple as the gas cap!
3837 2018-08-21 16:33:08 All great! And if you want super dark, @FletcherMR's Beyond Redemption will leave you feeling like you've just taken a light bath in crude oil. (In a good way.)
3838 2018-08-21 16:33:04 Oil pinch stirs dreams of moonshine travel.
3839 2018-08-21 16:32:53 Makes sense. Like oil companies investing in renewables.

3842 2018-08-21 16:32:39 As a thumb rule i will wait for further declines of 52 week stocks. Oil India too is looking quite attractive.  These scrips will test your patience as they move rather very slowly.

3844 2018-08-21 16:32:17 so why put them into a barrel of oil....nope what a coward cant even own his shit
3845 2018-08-21 16:32:17 I am not sure that your terminology is quite right for the message you are trying to convey there, pal.

Perhaps you mean '92% of the tax revenues generated from Scotland's oil trade goes to Westminster'?
3846 2018-08-21 16:32:15 2.) Aquaman is a bro now, so who cares about the environment. Just wait until the scene where he just dumps that oil tanker directly on to a group of seals.
3847 2018-08-21 16:32:09 Indeed, but obviously a lot did the sales of coconut oil soared. I love coconut water but have never used the oil. In India it is mostly used as hair and some poor people use it as a body lotion. It is very cheap in India.

3852 2018-08-21 16:31:40 Have you tried peppermint oil and cold ice pack? I’ve gotten them for years and even meds don’t work. This always knocks mine out. Sorry you’re feeling poopie! Also see: rosebud CBD for oil.

3868 2018-08-21 16:30:24 Most of our oil is self-supplied from Canada.  I do not support buying oil from any of those countries as the money they receive ends up in the hands of Islamic terrorists.  Unfortunately our PM is rather fond of terrorists and not so much Canadian citizens.
3869 2018-08-21 16:30:19 There was one Oil Rush.

3878 2018-08-21 16:29:12 So these snake oil salesmen managed to dupe 17.4m people for all walks of life and all positions in society, but didn't manage to dupe 16.1m people from all walks of life and all positions of society? Highly unlikley.

3880 2018-08-21 16:29:04 Interestingly, in the Western states covered by the 1872 law, the mineral didn't matter as long as it was a hard rock mine (not placer) and not an industrial mineral (gravel) or coal/oil/phosphorus. So gold/silver/zinc/lead/cinnabar (etc) all had the same procedure.

3891 2018-08-21 16:28:20 I’ve been moisturizing my face with that argan oil hair spray and it’s been working way better than anything else I’ve tried does anyone on here know of any reason why I shouldn’t be doing that
3892 2018-08-21 16:28:16 when cleaning a oil brush i always use 'dirty' white spirit first and then a drop a clean to finish it off.  save a fortune in white spirit,  i even have a dirty white spirit just for White so there's no colour contamination.
3893 2018-08-21 16:28:11 So why is our economy eclipsing Russia’s and killing them on oil and why are we selling Eastern Europe anti missile shields? And why are Russian soldiers dead in Syria now after obama let them in like he did in Crimea?
3894 2018-08-21 16:28:11 Have you tried an alkaline diet, CBD,and hemp oil?
3895 2018-08-21 16:28:10 in 2008 the ruble would have gone down with oil without the CBR trying defend the ridiculous 10 kopek wide basket band
3896 2018-08-21 16:27:54 #Iran wants to trade with oil but its energy infrastructures are in urgent need of investment. Good job #Khamenei and #Rouhani your best move was to refuse negotiating with #Trump.

3898 2018-08-21 16:27:35 Spuriously, you can’t be serious! Blue Wave means implementing policies with a scalpel - Smart & Strong. Red Wave means following orders with an axe and loyalty is a top priority & direct order - Weak & Bullheaded. You’re only fooling fools when you try to market your snake oil.
3899 2018-08-21 16:27:29 I think for serious commercial viability you have to get in the salons, and most or all of them are beholden to the big companies with co-branding and co marketing agreements.

3924 2018-08-21 16:24:19 @yeobeeyin YB, perhaps it's about time that we should learn on how to best use & keep our resources eg oil. Norway have oil fund and their fiscal don't depend on the oil revenue. One day oil would be obsolete and we're heading towards Doomsday.

3930 2018-08-21 16:23:36 Your shameless pandering to big oil for $$$ at the expense of America’s health and well-being is no longer shocking. You don’t even bother to hide your corruption anymore.
3931 2018-08-21 16:23:35 Fair point if you were not. I didn’t say the arguments were well put; in fact they weren’t “arguments” at all. They were statements and promises made by snake oil salesmen.

3933 2018-08-21 16:23:25 you already know!  I find that I’m always wanting a little extra boost, and caffeine makes you feel weird if you have too much.  Ashawanga, Macca, and CBD oil are all amazing tools for energy.   I use all 3 for working out, recovery, and cracking cheeks.

3977 2018-08-21 16:19:32 A pipeline poses much less danger to the environment than trains with oil crisscrossing the whole country. The reason you may feel pipelines are a problem is because Warren Buffett owns the railroads and can get his propaganda out via CNN and such for pay news.

4015 2018-08-21 16:15:45 Out today with Lates, been out to a couple of jobs already. One had no answer at their gate intercom. The other was for a possible oil leak on the A120 from a bus. But we have had a look and can't find anything slippery on the road.
4016 2018-08-21 16:15:41 Wow. When did he discover the two little girls dead bodies? Before or after he put them in the oil container? He’s evil.
4017 2018-08-21 16:15:35 your food tastes like sun tan oil when u cook with it, F that
4018 2018-08-21 16:15:31 No, but they give up reasonably priced oil. So please look the other way.....
4019 2018-08-21 16:15:31 @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @GOP Vote all of the trumpublicans out ASAP.
They are incompetent, complicit, treasonous traitors.  In the pocket of Putin, money from NRA, coal companies, oil companies doing nothing positive for the ppl of this country

4023 2018-08-21 16:15:17 I’m trying to “Anna Nicole Smith” me an old white oil baron and make off with the proceeds
4024 2018-08-21 16:15:02 The weirdest approach to snake oil sales is the "you'll be free of your daily medication" angle. Like, my medication is affordable with my healthcare, it works with my body, it alleviates my symptoms... your snake oil does nothing, tastes bad, and costs a lot. Bad pitch 0/10
4025 2018-08-21 16:14:54 He didn’t call 911. He made up an alibi. He lied to police. He didn’t cry or show emotion. He put his children in oil tanks. Buried his wife. I think we know who killed his children ffs.
4026 2018-08-21 16:14:52 Market cap, this could worth 1Billion if oil go to 100$. Thinking buying under 500mil$

4029 2018-08-21 16:14:31 Alternative view, US refuse to sell missiles to Saudi Arabia resulting in China/Russia selling them weapons and becoming closer allies with an oil rich nation, all of our fuel will go up, cost of goods will go up due to fuel rises bro. It’s a fucked up world
4030 2018-08-21 16:14:26 @exxonmobil we’ve been trying to get in touch with XTO for eight months about an issue with oil royalties. No one has ever called back. Do you have a solution?

4033 2018-08-21 16:14:23 When I was doing my diploma in cardiology and health education, coconut oil was classified as saturated fat( any fat which is solid at room temperature) I have been miffed by the sudden change of it being cure for all! Goes to show how half baked stories can be believed
4034 2018-08-21 16:14:15 You do realize that in about, a year and a half or so, nearly all renewable energy will be cheaper than coal and oil right? Was that not in the coal industries briefing? Can't make the case it's affordable if you're propping dying and dangerous industries.

4037 2018-08-21 16:14:05 @BarackObama I could have met you in Florida, when the oil Spill happened. But I didn't . 11-11-11 was when my resurrection started. Then, I became a False God.

4039 2018-08-21 16:13:54 I promise you! He is LYING! Anyone with a brain can see that. Let's just say she did strangle the kids and then he killed her. Why not call the cops tell them this, so the can run prints on the children's neck to prove this happen. No, instead you dump the kids in a oil drum?

4041 2018-08-21 16:13:49 Yesterday I told my mom that I went olive oil shopping in Green Bay because there isn't a ton of fancy olive oil in the northwoods and she said "I'm surprised there is in Green Bay" and I was very offended because FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE THE PACKERS LIVE THERE!!!

4045 2018-08-21 16:13:35 ..part of that is because Sweden is smart enough to not constantly be starting wars for the benefit of a few rich citizens, like the U.S. does...  (remember, the Iraq nightmare, during the Bush debacle, was started for Halliburton/Cheney's obscenely profitable oil interests..)

You have to oil them after you wash them or they will rust.
4056 2018-08-21 16:12:59 The Liberal Chancelor was installed in 2013.  The Lunatic Democrats can only destroy because they do not know how to build anything.  Ask a Democrat how to check their oil.
4057 2018-08-21 16:12:50 Yes I got all of these and the dog food instead of cat and Moroccan oil
4058 2018-08-21 16:12:48 "Well, let's see. First the earth cooled. And then the dinosaurs came, but they got too big and fat, so they all died and they turned into oil." Sorry, couldn't resist quoting Airplane II

4064 2018-08-21 16:12:14 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.

4073 2018-08-21 16:11:27 Haha mistakes happen!  I don’t mind the signing. Not sure if he’s much better than the other depth d men they have, but he should provide a different element as all the depth lefties the oil have seem to be defense first.
4074 2018-08-21 16:11:27 US crude oil stocks are down 3.687mmbbls of inventory, over that same period.  Yet, WTI has declined 12.58%, over that same period.
DXY, over that same period, gained 2.67% (94.20 open to 96.71 close).
A reversal in the DXY rise, will result in a reversal in the CL decline, IMO.

4081 2018-08-21 16:10:28 Yeah, he dumped his daughters bodies in oil tanks. I don’t think he is telling the truth. He’s trying to blame the victim, who is dead, to lessen his guilt.
4082 2018-08-21 16:10:28 Changes oil once becomes a man jk but you right about this!

4084 2018-08-21 16:10:19 I feel the CBD oil I take. Of course I only started taking it because I have to keep my THC levels pretty high to treat my movement disorder and it was starting to aggravate my anxiety. 
4085 2018-08-21 16:10:13 You people are snake oil salesmen taking advantage of weak minded fools.
4086 2018-08-21 16:10:09 Keep you tar sands oil and pipelines out of the USA.

4091 2018-08-21 16:09:41 H J RES 41, one of the very first bills signed into law under trump. It got rid of the SEC rule that made "resource extruders" like oil, coal, etc disclose foreign payments. Now why would the GOP not want a company like Koch Ind's reporting a payment say to Russia

4096 2018-08-21 16:09:15 A few things you definitely want to avoid in your diet are GMO soy, corn, wheat and canola oil, despite the fact that many "natural" health experts claim the latter to be a healthy oil. It's not, but you'll find it polluting many products on grocery store shelves.
4097 2018-08-21 16:09:13 Oil Lovers? You should message me. Seriously I have something to show you

Its not a joke anymore.. 

The oil works for beards like magic too. Makes it darker, soft, shiny and connects hair for those with scanty beards.. #500 yes,  #500
4103 2018-08-21 16:08:50 Yes cause your answer is to use more oil and pollute our shores.
4104 2018-08-21 16:08:46 I paid off my credit card and got my oil changed yesterday and now I have no money
4105 2018-08-21 16:08:34 me too that’s what was stopping me from using it but i was using bio oil & it didn’t really make it oily i just didn’t see a difference
4106 2018-08-21 16:08:30 I don’t have my glasses on and I thought you said castor oil
4107 2018-08-21 16:08:28 He’s a lying ass. He stuffed those babies in oil bins and hid the bodies.
4108 2018-08-21 16:08:27 devastating consequences Ryan LOL. Mr spineless 1, was keeping our air clean, water  and land protected from being destroyed by oil gas and the timber Industry.

4110 2018-08-21 16:08:22 It's never been about terrorism.

It's always been about oil.
4111 2018-08-21 16:08:20 Mmm...Beg to differ on coconut oil being regarded as poison and bad for you. Like everything else, there’s just waves of trends where people look to cash in and oversell something. Most things turn bad for you if you overconsume. It’s a chemistry thing.

4120 2018-08-21 16:07:39 Why is it that these assholes who kill their entire families always blame the wife for the death of the children? If she killed the girls, why would he toss his babies in oil tanks? I’m just disgusted.
4121 2018-08-21 16:07:35 So he got upset, killed them all then shoved them in an oil container?

4123 2018-08-21 16:07:18 Yea nice try dude. He killed all 3 & then tried to lie about them going missing. If he was so upset about the kids, why dump them into an oil tank? He's just evil.
4124 2018-08-21 16:07:06 So semen and viginal discharge onto plants and trees is not pollution.....but you will get into a lot of trouble if you dump used oil on the ground. It is TIME to defund many college departments and professors.

Can we email you some info?

4169 2018-08-21 16:03:28 Jesus said even if you look at a woman you are sinning. Yet he allowed a woman of sin to massage his body with oil in public. According to your wonderful bible. Sounds like sinless to me, yah sure
4170 2018-08-21 16:03:18 Please go sell your snake oil to someone else.  what you and the president are trying to do is make your coal buddies richer.  just stop and grow a pair and stand up to Trump

4172 2018-08-21 16:03:15 Does anyone believe the accused murderer in Colorado, who killed his pregnant wife after he claims she killed their 2 little girls because he asked her for a divorce? He buried the wife & put the girls in an oil tank. Yeah, me neither.
4173 2018-08-21 16:03:14 Right! If he cared so much about the kids why did he dump their bodies in oil tanks?!?

4179 2018-08-21 16:03:04 Only because we haven't been investing. Think if every new home had solar panels on its roof and could sustain its own power source? Think if towns had a centrally-located windmill that could provide energy? Think if oil tycoons weren't lining the pockets of elected officials...
4180 2018-08-21 16:02:59  meantally broke niggas. Jiffy lube is expensive & give you 5 qts of oil regardless of your car. Dealership is $20 - $35 for an oil change on most cars. Unless you have a luxury one.
4181 2018-08-21 16:02:59 Ted, many photographers still use 35 mm film. For the same reason vinyl albums still exist. Maybe never hold the same popularity, but don’t dismiss the medium. That’s kind of like saying oil and water painting is dead. Thanks

4213 2018-08-21 16:00:23 Three reasons for this:

1. You can't spy on people with oil rigs.
2. You can't sell oil rigs to the public and get rich.
3. _______________________
4214 2018-08-21 16:00:22 1. A long-term vision of a 100% communist model (think Of Cuba’s controlled and rationed economy)
2. Strong incentives to reap benefits from the decreasing supply of dollars from oil exports (this is purely thief behavior)
4215 2018-08-21 16:00:13 Why does someone with "Crypto" and "Energy" in his handle spew so many lies? NATO is not defending anyone except the oil and bank CEOs' profits.

4241 2018-08-21 15:57:32 Sure, of course some exports would increase in other areas. But if your #1 Export is Oil, and it's 98% of your export. The price falls from $100 a barrel to $50, you need other markets to pick up 49% of the lost revenue. They would need to increase rum production by 100,000% lol

4257 2018-08-21 15:55:57 Mi tesis sobre cambio de patrón de reservas "Ga-Ga" (como Lady) establece claramente por qué el galón de gasolina aventaja al barril de petróleo crudo: se trata de un commodity con un valor real (oil crack spread 3-2-1) de comercialización en lugar de un valor estimado en pozo.

4259 2018-08-21 15:55:48 Is this the company that had to drill really deep to get to the oil? I heard of one several years ago that was on top of a huge reserve

4303 2018-08-21 15:51:01 In the 70s, there were a lot of Ghanaians living in Nigeria & most of them illegally coz of the oil boom in Nigeria & the hardship economically in Ghana but a mass deportation occurred after the Vice President's house was robbed & the 2 robbers were Ghanaians.

4306 2018-08-21 15:50:50 Some would say that “snake oil” has a little to do with it as well!
4307 2018-08-21 15:50:35 @EricLiptonNYT It’s bad enough what already happens. There was a now former Amoco oil refinery near my parent’s/GP’s house. Cancer cluster killed & sickened many. MO DNR said Amoco didn’t cause it.  Coincidentally BP settled most of the lawsuits anyway.

4322 2018-08-21 15:49:12 US$8-billion project will see heavy crude transported from Alberta’s oil sands through Montana, South Dakota, and into Nebraska, where the pipeline will connect to the original Keystone, boosting its transportation capacity in a move much needed by Albertan oil producers.

4367 2018-08-21 15:44:34 Clean air and clean water, preserved monuments, and oceans free from oil spills, trump doesn't care for any of it. He lives for 2 things: to make a quick buck and to hear the loud applause from his base. Those are what motivate his political decisions and policy.

4371 2018-08-21 15:44:15 Trump/GOP/Koch Brothers etc. are propping up oil & coal by ACTIVELY attacking sustainable (green) sources of energy. Look at Trump's stand-up comedy bit against windmills. Cutting off all subsidies & even charging for solar to be connected to grid to transmit back to the utility.

4382 2018-08-21 15:43:14 Try replacing the word legalization with either "healthcare" "oil" or "technology", just for shits and giggles.
4383 2018-08-21 15:43:11 it is not necessarily Socialism that is at fault but the banks and countries that object to any country demanding more royalties for their people..oil rich countries have some of the deepest poverty and they are not Socialist by a long shot..

4397 2018-08-21 15:41:53 Venezuela is a member of OPEC.. the US was displeased with Hugo Chavez because of the increased royalties he sought for Venezuela..a campaign to lower the price per barrel of oil was employed.. gas prices dropped..this put Venezuela into an economic tailspin along with Russia.

4442 2018-08-21 15:38:51 Maybe we can revive whale oil too.
4443 2018-08-21 15:38:50 People should stop and research what occurrence for 5 years in Venezuela and the true cause of Venezuela collapse..global warming caused a drought..their power grid runs off hydropower..the collapse of oil prices added by a bad dictatorship..any government would of suffered..
4444 2018-08-21 15:38:46 Praying as I see God pouring healing oil on a gauze cloth I see him stroking your face as you have done with your bible. He is applying the healing balm of Gilead in you and over you. Another layer of healing, another layer of peace, another layer of love to bring sweet release..
4445 2018-08-21 15:38:41 Yes.. a hardworking man of integrity or a crude magnetic fake of a man.. a snake oil salesman

4449 2018-08-21 15:38:22 @cvpayne  herenis what i am thinking Obama may have had a part in the stock bull run. Since the 08  crisis Obama placed lots of regs market makers.I think  caused 1.9 to 2.0 frowth over 8 years. Like plug in bottle. Trump did away w/regs,tax cuts,animal spirits like an oil gusher
4450 2018-08-21 15:38:14 Natapunan ng motor oil yung drum sticks ko. Gusto ko magtae ng pera hayuf 
4451 2018-08-21 15:38:09 He is tying it to himself by commenting on it incessantly, even though it is not directly tied to him. And he most definitely will see the verdict as a reflection on him and will tweet accordingly.

4453 2018-08-21 15:38:05 For soup, cook crushed leek in oil, then simmer with beans, cumin, vegetable broth and asparagus. Top with scallions.
4454 2018-08-21 15:38:00 Saudi controls much of the electricity to North Iraq.
Iraq Oil flows to Turkey from pumping it with electric pumps.
The Valve to Europe from Iraq is inside of Turkey.
If the West sanctions Iran, Turkey, Turkey can shut the Taps. Iran can close the straits. This is the paradox.
4455 2018-08-21 15:37:59 I sealed my blunt with the oil last night. The blunt won.
4456 2018-08-21 15:37:58 That's why they're starting shot with Russia so if war breaks out then Scotland gets blown off the map and they then get too keep our OIL
4457 2018-08-21 15:37:31 I don't know but she could not be capable of killing her own daughters! And why did he dump the children bodies in the oil tank and not the wife only?
4458 2018-08-21 15:37:22 I will use your recipe and send you back our recipe for our "catalan Salmorejo ". An exciting cool juice blend of fresh tomato, bread, Olive Oil, salt, pepper and some vinegar.

4461 2018-08-21 15:37:19 Yep, so distraught about his daughters and so angry at his wife he buries her in a grave and just dumps the children in the oil. Yep, sounds like someone distraught over the death of his daughters.
4462 2018-08-21 15:37:16 This Jamaican Black castor oil I got from target is 
4463 2018-08-21 15:37:13 lamp oil or castor oil?
4464 2018-08-21 15:37:10 AIC posted a gofundme for a musician with dementia and someone commented "CBD oil" and I want to fucking punch that person through the computer.
4465 2018-08-21 15:37:10 His story is BS. He put his daughters’ dead bodies in oil containers. That’s quite telling.
4466 2018-08-21 15:37:06 Get me some 30 Weight oil and ball bearings... and some gauze pads.
4467 2018-08-21 15:37:03 me either. in fact coconut water is bad for diabetics and kidney patients so i question the oil.
4468 2018-08-21 15:36:50 ワイの課題の終わってる数は何個なんやろ
4469 2018-08-21 15:36:49 OK read the article. Why not call LE and if it is true there should be evidence to show she strangled the kids I would think. I can see where this might have happened but then putting your children in oil to hide them doesn't add up dude.
4470 2018-08-21 15:36:46 @SenhorRaposa 
I’m gonna refer to the GOP as the Pollution Party from now on
Sure,there are some Liberal Republicans,but the overwhelming scientific opinion shows that oil money corrupts Republicans
98% of scientists agree Republicans are complicit in destruction
4471 2018-08-21 15:36:28 They will take our oil and force us to stay if we scots are not in EU
4472 2018-08-21 15:36:25 How's she going to pay for extravagant weddings for her kids if she doesn't run for office, start a fake charity & use it as a slush fund? She'd have to use the hard-earned money her parents grifted from dictators, bankers, weapons dealers & oil barons. Go Chelsea! Clinton 2020!
4473 2018-08-21 15:36:21 Kojo, linked to the Iraq Oil for Food scandal?
4474 2018-08-21 15:36:18 And he didn't even (have to) mention Trudeau's ridiculous stance on Canada's oil industry.
4475 2018-08-21 15:36:12 I recall a decade or two ago when coconut oil was something to avoid at all costs. Now it’s a miracle substance - or is it? How about we just have balance in our diet and not believe hype? Just no one say anything bad about bacon and I’m good.
4476 2018-08-21 15:36:11 Then he threw them into an oil tank where he works, I'm sure he has convinced abc that he's telling the truth.

4484 2018-08-21 15:35:10 TransCanada does not own the oil or gas shipped in their pipelines.  Price of oil is not relevant.  They build a pipeline when shippers (that own the product) make contractual commitments to pay a tariff to ship the product.  Common carrier, like a trucking company or railroad.
4485 2018-08-21 15:35:07 It's neither. The amount of food we produce, the amount of fresh water, steel, lumber, coal, oil, cattle, etc. etc. has no dependency on a number in a spreadsheet.
You conflate national "debt" of the currency issuer which is financial assets in the economy with personal debt.
4486 2018-08-21 15:35:06 Nice work U S now no one wants to buy our oil. Obuma should have let things be.
4487 2018-08-21 15:35:01 why does looking at animals covered in oil make me sad, but looking at animals covered in oil and deep-fried make me hungry?

4492 2018-08-21 15:34:15 How is Saudi oil even allowed in Canada.
4493 2018-08-21 15:34:04 He wanted to be present during autopsy?  What a sick Mofo.  For him to claim the mother strangled daughters first, so he killed her...............oh, but now I'm scared so I'll just desecrate their sweet bodies more by submerging them in crude oil.  
4494 2018-08-21 15:33:44 I disagree.  The banks did not voluntarily walk away. Before the sanctions, there were countries that were in much worse shape than Venezuela.  Moreover, Venezuela has the largest oil reserves.  There is no question that the banks would have worked with them to extend payments.
4495 2018-08-21 15:33:38 If he cheated on taxes he stole from Americans
4496 2018-08-21 15:33:22 The gut is linked to depression. Could have an imbalance. Sugar free diet. Probiotics. Coconut oil. Apple cider vinegar. Worth a try if it doesn't go away.
4497 2018-08-21 15:33:21 Clove oil?
4498 2018-08-21 15:33:19 Continued: And at work I carried out my biz (I mean I put the bodies in crude oil tanks) and told Atkinson my wife was at a play date and then I got concerned when Shannan failed to also not respond to texts from her people I mean (I wasn’t because the bodies were w me) ...daddy
4499 2018-08-21 15:33:19 Well, it's an economic theory that will end up with a devalued currency, and you'll end up paying more for your food etc. When the oil fracking runs out, and if you're still keeping very costy military bases around the world, you'll soon see the result.
4500 2018-08-21 15:33:17 I bloody hope so! A country of barbarians. (Its rulers, anyway.) Un-qu'ranic. The Prophet would not approve of what goes on in Saudi. Disgraceful that oil etc brings silence in the face of cruel & absurd human rights offences & war crimes against Yemen.
4501 2018-08-21 15:33:16 It’s really sad what’s happening in Venezuela. Its citizens are spreading to other countries running away from economic hardships in their homeland. It’s like a repeat of Zimbabwe with inflation slated to hit 1-million % by year end. All this with their massive oil reserves.

4503 2018-08-21 15:33:13 Many Traders are going to get Gold trade wrong. The Dollar trade wrong. The Oil trade wrong. The Tech wreck wrong. The Emerging Markets wrong and Cryptos wrong. If you don't know what you are doing, doing it with leverage probably isn't a good plan either.

4510 2018-08-21 15:32:18 "New U.S. Sanctions Target Russia for Defying Rules on North Korea" by GARDINER HARRIS via NYT The administration’s targets include ships that were transferring oil to North Korean vessels, which imported the oil despite international sanctions.
4511 2018-08-21 15:32:17 There is a humanitarian crisis and you geniuses think it appropriate to write a story about the price of coffee? Shocked and appalled. We rely on Venezuela for oil. We have a longstanding relationship. How can @cbcnews @CBCTheNational be so callous? Canadians deserve better
4512 2018-08-21 15:32:11 To burn extra oil that no country is buying 
4513 2018-08-21 15:32:04 I think we mostly agree here. I was just saying that my hunch is that W is in fact at least a bit racist (not as much as Drumpf) and a bit narcissistic (different league than Drumpf). Much less of a mobbed up anything (though, all up in the GOP estab. mafia, arms & oil, etc..)
4514 2018-08-21 15:31:54 Like, is it supposed to be HIS job or mine?! I don’t get it and I am NOT looking that up on PornHub! I’ll stick to my oil searches thank you very much!!!lol 
4515 2018-08-21 15:31:44 3 for 3 on ES this am all short..missed the big move up at the open...how I have no idea just was not paying attention. Had order in at 66.65 for oil short...never filled and that was after I pulled my long buy stop at 65.65...little frustrating day today
4516 2018-08-21 15:31:40 The #sanctions are wrong and immoral, that is a given but the #elephantintheroom is that people were warning in 2013, long before sanctions, about the #embezzlement. Btw the US still buys oil from #Venezuela

4522 2018-08-21 15:31:20 Not my battle. I don't care if Manafort is guilty or innocent.  The trial is about tax evasion and events 12 years ago.  CNN keeps trying to tie the outcome to a reflection on Trump.

4530 2018-08-21 15:30:15 The other day, my electric generator won’t start. I adduced several reasons for the problem. Then, d mechanic pointed it out to me. It was out of oil.Of course I knew that when a generator is short of oil, it won’t start. But on dis occasion, it just didn’t occur to me.
4531 2018-08-21 15:30:13 We will pay out of our oil revenues after Indy. Alternatively @RuthDavidsonMSP can find some change from her #DarkMoney

4535 2018-08-21 15:29:53 The oil. It isn't hard here. Oil prices plummeted since the policies were implemented. Tack on U.S. sanctions and inflation and you have full-blown crisis.
4536 2018-08-21 15:29:43 君はそれで良い。
4537 2018-08-21 15:29:29 It is possible if they remove personal interest from oil and make it very cheap and stop the reliance on generators. In fact an outright ban on importation while they work to upgrade the power grid.
4538 2018-08-21 15:29:13 Used to be a big fan till I saw it contained palm oil
4539 2018-08-21 15:29:12 Don't forget the completely baby-free baby oil.
4540 2018-08-21 15:29:00 Oil use is projected to continue increasing although not uniformly around the world. So the answer would be yes in some countries, no in others.
4541 2018-08-21 15:28:59 Where are all the useless one sided human rights groups. Pathetic group of people bought by oil rich countries. Sitting behind air conditioned rooms n pocketing 6 figure salaries annually.
4542 2018-08-21 15:28:57 My question is why did he throw the little girls bodies in the oil tank? Why would he do that if he didn't kill them? I don't buy his confession.
4543 2018-08-21 15:28:57 Help!   I may be in the Black Lodge!  #TwinPeaks   The SF Bay Hills smell like scorched engine oil!
4544 2018-08-21 15:28:55 So in a nutshell your standard of living can be compared to that of California. You don’t expect petrol to be expensive in a major oil production state unlike your state where oil is not produced in large quantity.
4545 2018-08-21 15:28:54 Kind of oily (but not butter), undercooked, with some bacon bits sprinkled on top. Puddle of oil in the dish. If there was even the slightest bit of seasoning, including salt or pepper, it was unnoticeable.
4546 2018-08-21 15:28:53 How about actually solving problems instead of creating new ones? What about title 4? Why are so many of your snake oil brethren taking money from big pharma? But then again if you solved problems you wouldn't be able to fleece your sheep.

4550 2018-08-21 15:28:25 We just got the holy oil jug, so we can’t wait to add it to the trunk items at Salt Lake! There is sooooo much stuff! And we don’t even have everything yet and it’s already full!

4556 2018-08-21 15:27:23 Keep it simple. Oil twice, shampoo twice and apply conditioner if your hair needs it. Don't follow fad of serum etc,no blow dry unless of course you really have to. Don't change shampoo often & no running after famous, expensive brands.
4557 2018-08-21 15:27:18 1) Nichol Kessinger: 30. Works in the oil industry as a field engineer for Halliburton. This most likely is the “coworker” of #ChrisWatts with whom he has been having the affair. I’m assuming she had her Internet presence scrubbed because there is zero social media presence.
4558 2018-08-21 15:27:11 Wait-who's seizing these oil refineries?...and why can't #Venezuela take out a loan against the oil.

4560 2018-08-21 15:27:02 Facts can & often are used for FUD, as you are doing. Mix of sedans/SUVs swings every cycle based on oil prices. This has been true for decades. This cycle, however, demand is shifting from SUVs to Model 3's, rather than fuel-efficient ICE sedans, as Model 3 is 5x fuel efficient.

4563 2018-08-21 15:26:50 if that country didn't have oil the condemnation and sanctions would be swift. Lately it's been showing its true colours, attacking countries like Canada, Sweden & Germany but going after the peaceful. It's a warlike country, 32 million population, 3rd largest military budget

4568 2018-08-21 15:26:46 D21: Captain Tamol's ship is his home. The smells of salt, tar, wood, smoke from the galley, ink in the purser's office, whale oil burning in the lamps and the sweat of men hard at work all speak to him of home. #SensationalWIP

4570 2018-08-21 15:26:16 In an attempt to pacify my very heightened emotions, i turned the humidifier on only to realize few seconds after that i may have put in too much lavender and peppermint oil. Geez man. Get it together.
4571 2018-08-21 15:26:13 Ew, that's weird. They eat food and drink oil tho. How tf?
4572 2018-08-21 15:26:13 Don't believe in any of you shouting human rights. You are all popping up everywhere but none of you talk n condemn human right abuses done by the big superpowers n oil rich countries like Saudi. Never condemn the islamic extremists killing thousands in europe n africa n asia.
4573 2018-08-21 15:26:12 Cats are handy. A few months ago I lost my cuticle oil pen under/behind the bed. It has built in “cubbies” underneath so I couldn’t get to it. Lily just found it for me  yea kitty!
4574 2018-08-21 15:25:59 I cringe so much when natural beauty people recommend coconut oil as a moisturiser when it’s so highly Comedogenic. There’s so many other good oils out there. Use Shea butter instead if you want something thick and creamy and that won’t give you acne.
4575 2018-08-21 15:25:54 When getting an oil change, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to look at when they pull the stick out to show the oil level. I just nod in approval
4576 2018-08-21 15:25:48 @BigHitEnt 寝落ちした？
4577 2018-08-21 15:25:48 The price of fuel is crazy right now!!! We should be able to get subsidized prices now that we are able to export oil!
4578 2018-08-21 15:25:46 Lots. Pretty sure English retailers, insurers will all want access and pretty sure you’ll need our food, electricity and oil. Unless you’re threatening another Alien act?
4579 2018-08-21 15:25:26 It's not just the oil that destroys the oceans ... it's the plastic ... the ships the armies of this world ... and much, much more ... they all destroy what makes this world ... it's a masaker ... will we ever be able to stop it ... I do not know ..

4582 2018-08-21 15:25:13 Hell it looks pretty much the same to me. Just slap some coconut oil on it afterwards. Gotta know hot to do it though.

4588 2018-08-21 15:24:28 Omg I think the best purchase I’ve ever made was rose oil. I used it once last night and my skin is glowing so much, it’s soft, and even
4589 2018-08-21 15:24:19 He’s right, people like her know what they want to vote for and people like him don’t know what they want to make better about the country. When oil meets water, table wo lon shake.

4591 2018-08-21 15:24:18 A pack of Super Noodles, a pack of finger rolls, a pouch of Skittles, and some rapeseed oil to oil myself up with, and that's the best night in ever.

4593 2018-08-21 15:24:03 reaffirms the Oil Curse narrative Bro. Am sure the holiday dey lite for your side?
4594 2018-08-21 15:24:00 I have all of the tools I need in my shopping cart to begin production of this hair oil. I'm just scared to checkout.  What if I fail?

4596 2018-08-21 15:23:55 Really ripe avocados, mash with half a lemon, garlic, salt, pepper, little dash of olive oil, parsley or celery or basil, any aromatic herb you can find, chopped onions(finely chopped)....mix them together, you can make a chunky guacamole or a smooth one, for a smooth one, blend

4601 2018-08-21 15:23:27 Without looking into markets more it's hard to assess any on a business front. Generally I like the idea of finding more materials and products that we can make sustainably with microbes, so I'll be interested in what C16 does with palm oil.

4606 2018-08-21 15:22:46 Na wa. The economic woes of that country has demystified oil in a way I have never seen before
4607 2018-08-21 15:22:45 What kind of fancy pizza? My fancy pizza is from Papa Murphy's. Gluten free crust with olive oil and garlic, spinach, tomatoes, and jalapenos. Yum.
4608 2018-08-21 15:22:42 The Castor Oil took over 10 hours to start the mudslide, but i lost almost 6 pounds in 20 minutes.

4612 2018-08-21 15:22:10 I think USA with @usmissionuganda are not helping us physically because the oil is not yet ripe.
#FreeBobiWine
4613 2018-08-21 15:22:08 just like someone pays for farm & oil subsidies, a war on drugs many people think is bullshit, wars of choice we are lied into like Iraq, 100 military bases around the world many Americans don't want, etc. That's part of democracy. You don't get to pay only for what u want.
4614 2018-08-21 15:22:05 Clean coal technology does exist...  I almost wish all of the fossil fuel generating station could be shut down so folks would be left to Tweet with smoke signals.  No one likes big oil and big electric until their homes have no power and there cars have no gasoline.
4615 2018-08-21 15:21:53 This is from Oil Marketing Companies not BJP
4616 2018-08-21 15:21:52 I don’t believe in God because God doesn’t believe in me! All tragedy is a farce! A farce...of farts! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
4617 2018-08-21 15:21:46 What you're describing isn't unique to desirable coastal cities, either. Look at Edmonton/Calgary after their oil collapse that began in 2014. House prices there dropped maybe 10%. Rentals were affected more, and those only dipped 20-25%. Corrections larger than that don't happen

4620 2018-08-21 15:20:55 Our troops were RIGHT ON bin Laden's hideout, and GW pulled them away. Why was that? Because the Bushes did oil business with the bin Ladens? Or because Bush was a moron. Pick one.

4624 2018-08-21 15:20:14 As for climate changes, oil pollution, plastic clouds, clear water saving, everything on the earth needs to be considered on both side ! How to reduce consumption, and how to use possible resources. This is evidences. Futile is your complaisance.

4628 2018-08-21 15:19:47 Thats so right.  I'm so tired of everything being political.  Can't we just sit and watch a football game or movie, TV isn't much better.  I miss Johnny Casrson.
4629 2018-08-21 15:19:42 Hahaha, the ultimate "leave it" challenge. Mine bites her cod liver oil tablets and spits them out. Shame she's already eaten the oil by then....
4630 2018-08-21 15:19:30 Remember when we started cleaning up? Black lung slowed, cancers from asbestos & pesticides, air qualities improved, less marine life was dying, Native Americans didn't have oil pouring into their water supplies, kids quit dying from lead paint ..

4634 2018-08-21 15:19:20 True that, Sir. 
My thought is, these people do not drive or grocery shop. They have no idea how much soup or an oil change costs. 43 grand for a Dome of Silence? Sure. Why not?

Well, we humans pay money to buy/lease a car. $ we pay for maintenance $ on top of that we pay for oil changes $ we pay for insurance $ and we can’t forget about gas. BUT PAYING 200 FUCKING DOLLARS FOR A STICKER (license tab) IS FUCKING UNREAL

4661 2018-08-21 15:16:14 Getting there first, using your own money, with a useful solution, isn’t socialism.

Working hard to win market share from your competition isn’t socialism either.

The oil business is highly regulated (FERC, etc.), and not unusually politically privileged.

4668 2018-08-21 15:15:17 I can neither confirm nor deny that while I was getting my oil and wipers changed that I used Chevys shuttle service to take me to Target to browse and pick me up once they were finished with my car.

4690 2018-08-21 15:13:18 Yes, I now recognize that it´s perfectly consistent with leftist dogma to decry "Climate Change" while praising the export of Oil to be burned somewhere else as long as it funds their welfare state. 

Seems like Climate Change isn´t a serious issue for you people after all.
4691 2018-08-21 15:13:18 No need for dirty oil. Have you ever heard about hemp? 

Plastic is the most stupid invention ever, we need greener materials. 

We need to change now, or you’ll not recognize your country in 20 years...

4694 2018-08-21 15:13:09 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.
4695 2018-08-21 15:13:02 Isn't there a clause in the NATO agreement you don't join forces or arm with 'strategic opponents'? Sounds like a bad agreement when anyone can waltz out and team up with 'strategic opponents' without consequences. First it was buy oil, now it's weapons?
4696 2018-08-21 15:12:58 Well, they've been here...underground. But, just like in the old horror flicks, they've been unearthed by their leader. He's allowed them to come into the light and be free...try to infect others. I'm just anxious for the antidote to come in November, so we can obliterate them!
4697 2018-08-21 15:12:56 Let me interpret for the audience. When Republicans say "love our vets" - they don't mean "lets make public social programs to help out veterans" - they actually mean "we will give those guys a respectful and sincere salute while throwing vaults full of money into missiles & oil

4709 2018-08-21 15:11:44 As you're a trial attorney, there was already presumption that you are full of baloney. It was a rebuttable presumption, but that ship has sailed. You're not a IDIOT, so your pretending to believe "brownness" has anything to do with this is nothing but snake oil you're selling.
4710 2018-08-21 15:11:37 Lmaooo. Akua stop fresh acrylics. I should put it in palm oil. Sorry
4711 2018-08-21 15:11:32 Neil: But Rob, I don't think we should forget what lies behind the coffee we enjoy every day. It's a hugely complicated business.
Rob: Yes, it's the second biggest commodity in the world, after oil.

im having a great week
4714 2018-08-21 15:10:49 Strange as it seems, yes!  Hated Bush, but he was predictable, so we didn’t have daily anxiety about what he would do next. He lied, got us in a needless war for oil & Halliburton, embarrassed us in the UN (Colin Powell was never the same), still he was preferable to rTump.
4715 2018-08-21 15:10:48 We love coconut oil! It really softens up my daughter's hair and keeps her skin moisturized.

4719 2018-08-21 15:10:27 My capricorn moon is attracted to the idea of keeping a recycle bin & trash bin hidden under the kitchen sink with an essential oil & salt blend or a diffuser placed nearby to make sure that the kitchen smells clean & pleasant.
4720 2018-08-21 15:10:27 This is one of the reasons that Canada will soon become part of the third world. Dumb politicians like Singh who prefer to buy “bloody” Saudi oil or oil produced in countries with no environmental standards to Canadian oil. May God help us !!

He wanted both Alaska and Hawaii to be admitted to the union, but want Hawaii admitted first. #Congress, however, wanted #Alaska admitted first due to their #oil reserves.

Watch what he and his cohorts do with oil (global tax).
4731 2018-08-21 15:08:37 All they had to do was pay me what my car was worth, 5 grand and I would have been happy. I went to the Taylorsville Rd. location in Hikes Point. Louisville, KY.

4733 2018-08-21 15:08:31 I admit when I seen the lefty thing I raised an eyebrow. But I guess the Oil have more faith that Jerabek can move the puck & put up a few points than you feel he can. I guess we will see how it works out. May be a better bet than Davy who competes but can't skate, pass or playPP

4762 2018-08-21 15:06:21 Venezuela is a mess because the dictator was an illiterate bus driver. The govt squandered vast oil wealth on basically bribing the population for a few years until oil prices collapsed. A freshman economic student could govern that country better.

4764 2018-08-21 15:06:03 Worth it if you like blueberries and eggs. I just add a drizzle of oil to the pan, then throw in the blueberries for about a minute or so, then add in the eggs with them and scramble. Gives them a sweetness that almost reminds me of syrup!

4766 2018-08-21 15:05:54 Somewhere along the way, ‘minimum wage’ got confused with ‘living wage’ - I’ve had a minimum wage job for exactly 44 day’s of my life... when I was 13 working at Burger King... day 45 I was given a $1 raise and shown how to clean/change the fryer oil.

4785 2018-08-21 15:04:21 I’m already an above average awkward human being, but when I go to get new tires or an oil change it gets even worse 
4786 2018-08-21 15:04:13 Because there's oil beneath it.

And by 'swamp' we mean protected wetlands.
4787 2018-08-21 15:04:11 Qatar just lent $15 Billion to Turkey.
The cash helped prop up the Lira,
But if oil keeps rising, the dollar keeps rising, then gold will sink, and the collateral of Turkey is in Gold, their debts though are in Dollars. Get my drift they being strangled slowly.

4796 2018-08-21 15:03:18 That was a propaganda campaign. Hell, Pres Carter knew then we could be fossil fuel free, created Dept of Energy. He said we had the tech then but oil/coal got in the way.
4797 2018-08-21 15:03:17 If u r still greedy for oil, why should they stop selling it to you?

4809 2018-08-21 15:02:34 My imagination is always more vicious than my heart when it comes to punishment.  In his case, I think slow cooking him in a pot of oil would be appropriate.
4810 2018-08-21 15:02:21 So do you think a country who went to illegal war for oil will let scots walk away with their oil cos they voted?
Thie is Westminster we are talking about here!
You are just pissed cos you know my last tweet is right
4811 2018-08-21 15:02:16 Now you acknowledge the Natives but when they fight for their land not to have an oil pipeline destroy their water and wildlife its ok to promote them? Shame on you!!!

4842 2018-08-21 14:59:23 I’m so happy that Harry is going strong! As for me, the key is controlling my pain. Regular meds aren’t working so mom is adding cbd oil. Cross your fingers.
4843 2018-08-21 14:59:13 We've all faced issues in our lives where we've hoped for a quick and easy "cure" for our problems, but ... America is too precious to be turned over to a bunch of snake oil salesmen greedy for $ and power
4844 2018-08-21 14:59:10 Who said America was out of energy? People have correctly said that coal and oil & gas are non-renewable, dirty and finite energy sources. Why is exporting oil great for America anyway? Are we a Banana Republic? A great country would reduce consumption and invest in alternatives.
4845 2018-08-21 14:59:06 I bet Scottish OIL will pay for  the refub of WM, refurb of Buck Palace, Pay rises for the MPs, HS2 rail network, Refub of English Prisons and much more - WM is grabbing the dosh whilst Scotland remains in the UK. Robbing bastards @IsThisAB0t
4846 2018-08-21 14:59:01 @Lord__Oil don’t like the fact that 70%of the  population hate the old gay white man? Wait and see what happens in November if the mueller probe doesn’t get him first
4847 2018-08-21 14:58:59 Start asking what if USA says no Canada we dont need your oil for 10 years. Alberta fails and the east starts having to pay the west equalization payments. Insolvancy, suicide, and homicides rates inflate. Why would our nation want that?

4865 2018-08-21 14:56:25 Ok so like what kind of thirst is a Molly-inspired tiefling monk that always carries bottles of oil to lube up before a big fight?

4875 2018-08-21 14:55:20 why do people get oil changes in places you have to get out of the car?
4876 2018-08-21 14:55:19 @TiffanyHaddish was likely reading the teleprompter. She likely doesn't know much about Camila Canola Oil and her anti-blackness. MTV just used a  black woman to co-sign a racist white woman.  #VMAs #VMAs2018
4877 2018-08-21 14:55:10 Really! So enlightening! What about Saudi Barbaria. They just won the world democratic contest! That is why you focus on Iran! Iran needs to reform for its people’s sake urgently, stop jewish hate. But this is regime change PR and trickery by oil lobby and Israeli lobby.
4878 2018-08-21 14:54:56 Tobacco companies used discredited science to push cigarettes.  Oil companies use discredited science to push global warming.  Politicians use discredited economics to push austerity.  Humans are gullible.

4932 2018-08-21 14:49:50 Why didn’t anyone tell me that oil is the key to perfect blemish free skin !!
4933 2018-08-21 14:49:49 What do you call federal subsidies to the oil industry? If "free stuff" for people is socialism, what is "free stuff" for corporations? After all, corporations are people too. The Supreme Court says so.
4934 2018-08-21 14:49:44 Get ready to buy trash medical cannabis users! This law we voted for was ruined by money. I shouldn’t have to pay 400$’s a month for my meds. On top of that they have shit products. Nothing but the vape will give you any type of affect. Everything else is snake oil. It’s just BS.
4935 2018-08-21 14:49:42 I read somewhere a while back that the #climatechange industry is now bigger than the oil industry, but I can’t remember where I saw it
4936 2018-08-21 14:49:42 I'm depressed that the improvement figure quoted was a round 30%. Properly-thought-out snake oil requires decimal places. 32.7%, for example... it just makes the sales pitch sound more realistic. 
4937 2018-08-21 14:49:39 Yeah he has your back till you get black lung disease. You're on your own then pal. #coal and #oil is exploitation of the blue collar worker. Its not just about jobs. It about smart safe jobs. #GoGreen

4945 2018-08-21 14:49:12 How can the case for a rich country be flawed?
England would struggle to be indy cos they have no oil or gas or leccy or water.
So the problems you mentioned are npt problems at all,,they are the things indy countries deal with.

4971 2018-08-21 14:46:24 I started buying it because you use butter instead of canola oil, but stopped because its just too salty, even wen I try to cut it with rice krispies. I broke down and bought some again. I regret it. Total Salt Bomb.

4975 2018-08-21 14:45:43 It’s interesting how third world countries got all the resources in the world (oil, gold, diamonds and others) however their countries are poor and corrupted and Western Europe for example has no gold or oil however they built the greatest economies in the world
4976 2018-08-21 14:45:41 The crazy left is definitely vulnerable to snake oil stuff, too.
4977 2018-08-21 14:45:33 No, "virtue signaling" is when you let on that you display compassion for anyone without taking direct action in that moment. Or if you're showing compassion for people the speaker dislikes. When you're tired of charlatans selling snake oil, you're just being a cunt or whatever.
4978 2018-08-21 14:45:29 Whatever marketing campaign wrote the ad where *everything* is powered by a tiny, exhaust-belching engine was genius as the subtext (to me) was in effect an honest depiction of our addiction to oil. Wish I could find that ad again...

4984 2018-08-21 14:44:39 Russia's strategy is probably more influenced by short term extraction industry interests (Gazprom specifically) than hastening climate change. Russia traffics in anti-extraction propaganda in the US and Europe to decrease competition and raise intl oil prices

If scots are not in EU Westminster will steal our oil and gas and try to scupper our indy ship,,they will behave like big bairns instead of accepting scots vote,and try to keep us by force.
5011 2018-08-21 14:41:51 But that assume there’s nothing in between that timeframe (since personally I believe that US does lost interest in Persian Gulf oil flow (no CSG since Ted Roosevelt completed it’s deployment and Harry S Truman was recalled before crossing Suez Canal).

5104 2018-08-21 14:32:24 I don't have any reason to believe it was oil, UK companies were already present and working with them for oil. I don't know too much about that side to know what it is, but regardless the UN did not want them to go to war thus you had many countries opposing the intervention.

5118 2018-08-21 14:31:09 Only Illinois would have a snake oil salesman like this as a treasurer. Why are you wasting tax payer money promoting this nonsense on twitter. Can’t you find better ways to spend taxpayer money in the state hovering one notch above junk bond status? @ILTreasurer #twill
5119 2018-08-21 14:31:00 The last thing we need is more freaking, constantly drizzling, oil platforms and pipelines that burst sooner or later, contaminating land and water and killing creatures.

5121 2018-08-21 14:30:53 Butter vs oil? 
5122 2018-08-21 14:30:49 Thank you Squeeze. IMO this is over rated. Specs positioning can remain over-extended for long. Take Crude Oil for example. Specs got net long 95% Dec/17, this stayed above 95% consistently and reached 98% in May/18. Then prices popped another 5% straight.
5123 2018-08-21 14:30:47 america gave saddam an ultinatum which he did not heed to. he posed a threat to kuwait. and sure it was not about removing saddam per se. it ws about oil. oil is a good reson for war. you car runs on it.
5124 2018-08-21 14:30:46 Even if they had "high accuracy" if these individuals were real traders they'd be making bank. That means they wouldn't be asking others for money in exchange for their trade ideas or what not. Yet they are. #WTI #OOTT #Oil #CrudeOil #Crude #Brent #OPEC #CL_F #ES_F #NQ_F #DAX30
5125 2018-08-21 14:30:35 Sure is. Everything is up this morning Everywhere (ok, FTSE down 0.2% - meh). If oil stays up we'll get some growth ok/pending demand rhetoric so maybe can play refiners to the upside. Poor EIA report though may knock it back down.

5138 2018-08-21 14:29:38 Really? I mean, water destroys DNA evidence. I guess it's possible that oil seals it in, but boy I'd sure need to talk to an expert to believe that.

5140 2018-08-21 14:29:23 One aspect was missing: Finland and especially Norway has very high public sector ownership of the "production machinery". In Norway its the "Oil fund". In Finland its the social security funds. Public sector wealth is one commonly accepted attribute of socialism, right?
5141 2018-08-21 14:29:23 I know I'm not supposed to ruin a joke with arguments, but since when do Sweden, Finland and Denmark rely on oil?
5142 2018-08-21 14:29:23 Have you noticed how Hollywood is suffering?  Box office receipts have fallen off cliff. There isn't an organized opposition, but I for one, no longer watch movies or any shows on TV that highlight those who try to use their celebrity as a platform to push their views.

5206 2018-08-21 14:21:22 The problem is, the AHA posts dietary advice RARELY, and when they do, it’s a complete joke. Coconut oil being described as “pure poison” and supported by the AHA is NOT an example of dietary advice. For once I want to see advice that is truthful and helpful

But Nigeria is fast recovering
5255 2018-08-21 14:16:36 Bloomberg:What happens when the country with the world’s largest oil reserves becomes its latest failed state? As Venezuela’s government grows increasingly despotic, a crack-up is accelerating — and despite plenty of warning, the world remains unprepared for the consequences.
5256 2018-08-21 14:16:32 But you said you don’t watch CNN (liar).

You say it’s Fake News.

So now you’re reporting Fake News?

This unpredictable business climate could be replicated in NAFTA changes. Less business investment due to uncertainty will reduce jobs!

5278 2018-08-21 14:14:14 #opendata movement varies by country; I think there's more opportunity for democratic accountability in developing countries. Developed countries have ceded the OD space to the market. After all, "#opendata is the new oil" #ODEndgame
5279 2018-08-21 14:14:11 Let’s just start with keeping our own revenues on the the stuff we make. We are resource rich - and I’m not talking oil!
5280 2018-08-21 14:14:08 He kisses her cheek softly. "Are you allowed to lay on your stomach?" he grabbed some massage oil form the cupboard, he always had some ever since he got married to molly.

5282 2018-08-21 14:13:58 The bits about the Srin Lanka contract definetly were. 
The media (and the public opinion) certainly tend to view any port/mine/oil deal as a rip-off be it with China or Bollore. 
Sometimes those things aint that bad.

5295 2018-08-21 14:12:42 I agree with what you say there but the #1 top priority issue for this planet is de-nuking Israel. As long as they have the big extortion stick they will wield it to leverage Cold War mechanisms that entrap the entire western world into war machines & the oil that fuels them.
5296 2018-08-21 14:12:19 Wait, wait, wait. 

That Watts guy says his pregnant wife killed their two daughters so he  in a fit of rage, he killed her?

And why did you dump your wife’s body?

5299 2018-08-21 14:12:08 I will look it up for you when I get a chance. I studied much on this. Some of it was taken away from the Word by the evil ones so that their agenda od once again denying us the Holy oil could be carried out again. And they have. Cannabis is illegal.

5313 2018-08-21 14:11:14 Yes they r. They make billions of petrodollars that they can ONLY invest the bulk of in US as well as have their oil controlled by Zus Companies.

Can u believe that there is unemployment & poverty in that country? Not to add that they r as racist as hell against blacks?

5319 2018-08-21 14:10:38 We have to do both - while remembering that: 1) the solution is kicking the fossil fuel habit; 2) 100 years of fracked shale oil and gas bad for people and planet; and 3) that road leads the more tar sands, oil shale, and liquified coal down the line.

5331 2018-08-21 14:08:37 these look like oil paintings 
5332 2018-08-21 14:08:03 Keep feeding them crappy food and telling them that coconut oil is bad for the heart and you’ll have all the personalized patients you could ask for

5334 2018-08-21 14:07:58 Good point.

Except that a cubic mile of recoverable oil reserves is a gigantic amount of oil:
26 000 000 000 barrels.

Equivalent to Aghajari field in Iran.

Number 9 on the list over the worlds largest oil fields.
5335 2018-08-21 14:07:47 Can we move into to the 21st century, new technology, alternative sources. Instead of going backwards. Create new jobs in the coal towns by embracing new technology and techniques. Coal& oil come from the dinosaurs but these policies are for dinosaurs and antiquated

5338 2018-08-21 14:07:26 One of the folks I follow recommends slathering up with coconut oil to provide a barrier. I haven’t tried it but I can feel myself getting there if the air doesn’t clear up a bit.

5354 2018-08-21 14:05:44 Anyone can go read about coconut oil for 5 minutes online and figure out quickly that what the #AmericanHeartAssociation is telling them is a complete sham.

same cooking show: well seasonings and olive oil and lemon and garlic and onions don’t count so it’s really a 20 ingredient recipe but who’s counting
5363 2018-08-21 14:05:19 It’s imperative that the noise is cut amongst the economists on Rupee & Fiscal Deficit,which has apolitically performed well last couple of years & needn’t be supported beyond a level. Trade deficit & exports are focus areas,concern with rising oil price/Iran scenario.
5364 2018-08-21 14:05:18 So you are justifying the higher amount recorded between 2015-2017 due to short fall in global crude oil price? 

The question I will ask is which of these amounts borrowed translated into infrastructure in the country.

We should be ashamed of ourselves arguing abt who did more.

5382 2018-08-21 14:02:28 Evan McMullin is a two-bit con artist.  Or maybe just misguided.  Or perhaps conspiring against the United States.  Or maybe just a carnival barker or snake oil salesman.  And if he backs Romney, then Romney may be as bad.  It's seriously time to realize Trump is saving America.

5394 2018-08-21 14:01:10 My opinion is why would you use #Venezuela as an example. What about under #putin or #Syria there are so many other examples.  VENEZUELA is only being squeezed by the rich white in #Florida to seize in on the oil in that country.

5401 2018-08-21 14:00:34 The airlines seem very insulated from their customers' concerns.  They seem to be able to shrink the seat width and legroom every year or two.  They are still adding a fuel surcharge to tickets from the oil price spike over half a decade ago.  Why?

5420 2018-08-21 13:57:41 Turkey funded ISIS by buying most of the oil stolen from Iraq when they occupied the oil fields there thru most of Obama's time. Convoys of tankers went back & forth from Turkey>Iraq for years.

Turkey is no friend & shame on @washingtonpost for cheering them taking US hostage.

5422 2018-08-21 13:57:28 Am not satisfied with the Govt's plan to allocate Oil blocks to each state of the Federation. Am not from an Oil producing state, because it'll make states like mine to fold their hands & abandon all other numerous Mineral Resources deposited in the states.

5423 2018-08-21 13:57:25 But the "filling up" does not account e.g for a peak oil or growth on pollution does it... it seems that is a simple logistic prediction with no feedback form other important human subsystems, namely, non-renewable resources, agriculture, etc.

5426 2018-08-21 13:57:13 OIL 1H has pierced below 20MA one time this morning. The 5th wave up has ended, correction lower is choppy/whipsaw, but has started. WATCH confirmation BELOW 20MA as follow through on correction lower. DGAZ or GASL ?
5427 2018-08-21 13:57:11 Genie energy doesn't think oil and gas are a scam.
5428 2018-08-21 13:57:09 For me Nostro/Vostro is the wrong reference. #XRP needs to cover the payment volumes for all the use cases they target such as remittances, trade volume e.g. oil, diamonds, micro-payments, derivatives, ... that's much higher
5429 2018-08-21 13:57:00 Can you please tell us why Russia is an enemy of US or is it that your stock portfolio would benefit from such a war and destruction? You get more bees with honey than war...

5434 2018-08-21 13:56:42 Utter guff. The difference is McGinn played well against us several times and showed he was a decent player who could do a job. McKenna is a big Diddy who turns slower than an oil tanker. We also need someone to come and improve us now. McKenna is even worse than Hendry FFS
5435 2018-08-21 13:56:24 Be honest, who bought the oil high and is sitting offside saying i'm not even worried this thing is so strong'?

5442 2018-08-21 13:55:36 Wars the Americans started. Iraq was all about oil, Saddam would never have let groups like ISIS even start let alone flourish. Gadafi, the same, Hilary Clinton was advised at the highest levels to leave well alone but didn't, hence the country is wide open for refugees .
5443 2018-08-21 13:55:10 I guess I’ll go get a oil change & wash my car today
5444 2018-08-21 13:55:02 Oil is blood money & the  should NOT be depending on foreign oil
5445 2018-08-21 13:54:45 Horrible. I was talking to a woman who worked 
in Saudi and where they carry out the executions 
they push the westerners up to the front to show
them how proud they are of this practice.

They are Bedouin a nomadic tribes ppl &  Saudi 
created out of the oil rush by UK.

5447 2018-08-21 13:54:38 Are you actually removing oil at this moment? If so, when do you expect the operation to be completed?
5448 2018-08-21 13:54:27 So, that guy (who was having an affair - NOT shocking) murdered his wife only AFTER she strangled at least one of their children? THEN decided to cover it all up by throwing them in a vat of oil? Oh okay. Sounds legit. NOT. Fucking creep.
5449 2018-08-21 13:54:25 Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley will meet with a six-member OWTU team, led by Ancel Roget today to discuss the restructuring of the state-owned oil company, Petrotrin.
5450 2018-08-21 13:54:21 So now you’re against competition? Why not allow solar & alternative energy compete with oil? Dictate much?

5466 2018-08-21 13:51:42 Read an article by an artist where he said, 'If you're a beginner, do not start with #watercolour. Start with oil/acrylic #painting.'

I've already started with watercolour. 

Dear Artists --- what do you think? Is #oilpainting/#acrylicpainting easier than #watercolorpainting?

5470 2018-08-21 13:51:28 Okay, here are the genocidel policies you asked for:

1. Mentally torturing immigrant children by throwing them in cages at the border.

2. Approving Dakota Pipeline that leaked oil into Native American river as was anticipated.

3. Allowing 3D printed gun restrictions to expire.

5492 2018-08-21 13:48:56 Venezuela allowed every industry except oil wither and die and imported everything else for 60 years. When the price of oil stopped rising, they had no other industries to fall back on. This was long before Chavez
5493 2018-08-21 13:48:56 You have spent way too much time listening to the BS spewed by FOX FALSE NEWS and the coal and oil industry.   And China will run past the US in terms of alternative energy sources as we return to coal.

5520 2018-08-21 13:45:58 Turkey is no friend/ally of US - who was main buyer of ISIS oil stolen from Iraq when they occupied lands/oil fields thru most of Obama's tenure? TURKEY/ERDOGAN, that's who. Oil tanker convoys went back & forth for years.

Turkey literally funded ISIS. Now they hold US hostage.

5526 2018-08-21 13:45:26 Okay, I accept it. This smoke isn't going away. From this point on, we are living in Mad Max. Start stockpiling oil and gasoline, put together your War Rigs and I'll see you all in the Thunderdome.
5527 2018-08-21 13:45:25 I had to get my oil changed while on vacation in Florida. It was a drive-in and the whole thing took 10 minutes, including filling out all my vehicle info. And since I had to stay in the car, I was able to watch everything as it happened. Life changing experience.
5528 2018-08-21 13:45:22 Someone in this waiting room has on enough perfume/essential oil to knock out a horse. 40 min left sitting in this stench.
5529 2018-08-21 13:45:15 I thought he ate snake oil pellets every day for breakfast anyway. He surely speaks with forked tongue!

5533 2018-08-21 13:45:05 @VinnieTortorich ... after the 10mins. of going against coconut oil, she then goes off on superfoods - where she's right. We don't need chia, açai, Goji and the likes - she then promotes home grown local foods, so she's right about that. Oh and Vitamin D as a main issue as well.

5535 2018-08-21 13:44:56 Defense is looking for touch DNA to backup Chris's claims that #ShanannWatts killed the girls. His story doesn't make sense. Why didn't he pull Shanann off Celeste? Call 911? Begin CPR on Bella? Why dump the babies bodies into oil tanks?
5536 2018-08-21 13:44:53 Thanks, so no Oil right?
5537 2018-08-21 13:44:52 By late 2014 Nigeria was on well on the path of a recession. Look at GDP growth data: 

Q3 2014: 6.23%
Q4: 5.93%
Q1 2015: 3.96%
Q2 2015: 2.35%

With halving of oil prices in 2014, and absence of a savings buffer 4d ‘rainy day’, the economy was doomed well before May 29, 2015
5538 2018-08-21 13:44:46 Healthy skin is important... I like shea butter but think I’m bout using coconut oil instead now 
5539 2018-08-21 13:44:44 I also have to get an oil change today AND get my car inspected AND go to the bank truly a nightmare
5540 2018-08-21 13:44:44 There's no clean way to burn the oil out of rocks.

The data there is not all about"External Debts" but DEBTS.

Look again to see the borrowing btwn 2010-2015&2015-2017.
We leave oil boom out it yet.
Go on...
5549 2018-08-21 13:43:51 This is exactly it. Oil can be safe, but it's not a long term solution. One day we will run out so we need to start building up alternate energy methods long before that happens

5565 2018-08-21 13:41:37 Somehow doesn't sound plausible. Nobody who cared about their kids would dump them in an oil tank.

5567 2018-08-21 13:41:30 Look at Zimbabwe. Look at Venezuela... it will happen. SA is not pivotal to the global economy. SA has no oil. SA is expendable... once foreign credit dries up the flames will start burning. The Guptas have already left. They were always a few steps ahead of the nation!

If CO2 does not cause global warming then you should buy all the coal and oil stocks you can.
5571 2018-08-21 13:41:10 I call them the ‘oil & weapons global cartel’.
5572 2018-08-21 13:41:00 I'm not even that much against pipelines relative to other forms of transportation. It is the safest. I'm more against what's inside (as a long term form of energy - short term needs are there). We could stop using the oil and then we don't need any transport lol
5573 2018-08-21 13:40:58 DEFINITELY oil painting worthy

5576 2018-08-21 13:40:31 I believe the Germans developed clean coal back in the 1940's.  We never adopted the technology because oil was plentiful and cheap.

5592 2018-08-21 13:38:27 So, like Popeye v Olive Oil?  About the same size
5593 2018-08-21 13:38:27 When a country performs badly, leaders are to blame. I heard that Venezuela used to supply Cuba with free oil. Why? And why can't they market their own oil? Here in Kenya, when over-borrowing repercussions hit the shilling, you will hear officials blaming external events.
5594 2018-08-21 13:38:21 Then José Arcadio Buendia threw three doubloons into a pan and fused them with copper filings, orpiment, brimstone, and lead. He put it all to boil in a pot of castor oil until he got a thick and pestilential syrup which was more like common caramel than valuable gold.
5595 2018-08-21 13:38:20 Put any kind of oil around them and they’ll loosen up 
5596 2018-08-21 13:38:13 El anclaje al Petro, es un invento astuto, el precio del oil es relativamente estable, se ancla el Bolivar a esa moneda virtual, se le exije al mercado q confíe, confianza forzada (Cuba, NorKorea, China), el gob no reconoce al paralelo, comerciante q lo haga, viola la norma.
5597 2018-08-21 13:37:52 Makes total sense. She killed the kids then he killed her and his the girls bodies in oil drums at his place of employment. He obviously didn't want anyone to know what their mom did 
5598 2018-08-21 13:37:42 I have a vehicle that can spray a deadly film of oil across the road - it's called an old VW!

5601 2018-08-21 13:37:28 It's called free speech, you know, that thing Trump is trying to take away. The thing you forget is that people can speak bad about the president and still love our country. That is why they are speaking up.
5602 2018-08-21 13:37:21 Which Golden Rule are you talking about? The Bible one or business one.
Trump and his cabinet vote against us Veterans, so in return I point out Trumps flaws to his support group, here and in Putins Russia.
As an engineer in oil and gas, I certainaly hope you  believe in science!
5603 2018-08-21 13:37:19 There used to be cries of saving the whale oil business in the 1850s.
5604 2018-08-21 13:37:17 Norway is an unusual case, that of a small nation, with a small, lightly industrialized economy, that happens to have *huge* oil reserves, *entirely* located on its (government owned) outer continental shelf.
5605 2018-08-21 13:37:05 I’ve met several healthy #vegans over the past year. They all avoid bread & pasta like the plague, minimize seed oil consumption, don’t eat any ready made/pre-packaged “food”, and take supplements. The most processed thing ever on their plate is tofu.

my retard old car,using a lot of oil for daily work.
My cousin thought it will be great idea
To lock the oil meter at full
So the car always never use the oil when driving.
Plus he told that,we have full tank 

I am like!
5612 2018-08-21 13:36:00 IT offers new 'silver bullets' for slaying Werewolves every six month. Makes snake oil salesmen look quite honest. Blockchain is being evangelised as solution to almost everything and why wouldn't the executives jump on the bandwagon until another one comes along...
5613 2018-08-21 13:35:52 After a sleepless night from a "toothache" I decided I had had enough so I went for extraction after which the dentist said I had an abscessed tooth which kind of explains why my trusted remedy of clove oil was useless
5614 2018-08-21 13:35:51 So the 170 page document was just as much use as not having a document at all, fantasy costings based on fantasy oil price of $130/barrel when in 2016 (leaving day if voted out) was $35/barrel. Also no backup plan for rUK saying no to pound. IMO a joke document.

5628 2018-08-21 13:34:27 We have struck oil boys
5629 2018-08-21 13:34:19 And this is an idiotic comment. They are both works of art. What value judgement are you putting on an oil painting that doesn't apply to a statue?
5630 2018-08-21 13:33:51 That makes sense. Instead of calling police and an ambulance to help your kids and see your wife prosecuted, better to kill her and then sneak their bodies into a remote area at work and bury your wife and throw your kids in crude oil. Yeah, perfect sense.
5631 2018-08-21 13:33:50 Dis you bath in oil?
5632 2018-08-21 13:33:45 Our big accomplishment is making so much plastic. Perhaps some future species will fight over it like we do oil.

5635 2018-08-21 13:32:41 Yes & No. Because you can’t slick a can of oil. So it’s all relative
5636 2018-08-21 13:32:36 It’s easy, but the cleanup can be kind of a pain. Just heat vegetable or canola oil in a deep skillet until a tortilla sizzles when you put it in. Put it in; let it go for 15 sec. Bend into taco shape, fry 15 sec more until it’s, you know, hard as a taco.
5637 2018-08-21 13:32:33 He’s grasping at straws. They already determined that his children had been down in that oil well for days. He probably killed them right after the wife went out of town.
5638 2018-08-21 13:32:31 These are oils that have a rating of 4 - 5 and should be avoided with people prone to breakouts:

5661 2018-08-21 13:30:13 Days after angry Brazilians hold anti-immigrant protests to drive out Venezuelans, kinda reminds one of South Africa slaughtering Nigerians or demonstrating against Nigerians in their country.

Both Oil rich nations, but citizens suffer greatly.

5662 2018-08-21 13:30:07 Yeah, three wins without the division of brexit and he had the corrupt Murdoch empire on his side. Things have changed dramatically since 1997. We've had neo liberal decay, oil wars, deep recession and a reinvigorated nationalist wave. Blair had none of this to contend with.
5663 2018-08-21 13:30:04 I know this tidbit is after the fact but before you get them next time do a hot oil treatment. For now I would get some hair oil and a bottle with a small nozzle and put oil on it and massage it into your scalp.

5665 2018-08-21 13:30:02 Did you know?

Our "magnesium oil" isn't an oil at all! It is purified water than is so highly concentrated with magnesium chloride that it feels oily.

5668 2018-08-21 13:29:39 The Petro is more like a gold standard (oil standard) than a "normal" cryptocurrency. It'll probably rein in inflation in the short term, but then the country will have little control over monetary policy and lose all the other benefits of fiat currency.
5669 2018-08-21 13:29:37 Your mouth is way too dirty for a dumb bird! I'm going to fry you in oil! When your real owner comes to get you I'm going to kill them!
5670 2018-08-21 13:29:32 . So here’s the thing, there are a few ways to prepare your body for drinking more than normal and not getting mega inebriated. Mix some yeast with some yoghurt before drinking. And then drink a teaspoonful of olive oil

5680 2018-08-21 13:28:26 Your "argument" doesn't make much sense. 

Obama changed the tide of the economy from a downward trend to an upward trend. 

I'm not sure why you can't see that. 

Trump is a snake oil salesman who is telling his supporters what they want to hear.
5681 2018-08-21 13:28:09 Yey they will burn whilst not cooked properly on the inside,the oil must not be too hot...the problem is in your mixture,the mixture must be soft,so pour more water and kneed

5684 2018-08-21 13:27:51 First malayali landed in UAE as early as 1953 before oil was discovered there. Many of them spent decades and helped building gulf countries.

5696 2018-08-21 13:26:37 By the way Chavez did the right thing in struggling back oil revenues from American, Spanish and Brasilian oil companies. Those revenues were clearly mismanaged, mainly by his successor and by the military, which, whatever they say are neither left or right wing, just corrupt.

5710 2018-08-21 13:25:03 Love to make a 9 am oil change appointment only to be sitting here at almost 9:30 with my car still parked out front.

5712 2018-08-21 13:24:54 So I dropped my car off for an oil change and decided to catch a Lyft to work. The Lyft said it would be $19 where I was at so I decided to catch the bus (for free) to get as close as possible to my job. I also have a Lyft credit of $5.

Cost of trip was only $1.85 
5713 2018-08-21 13:24:54 For generations our government (all governments) considered unlimited access to oil a national security issue. #BigOil benefitted from that policy. Now they just can’t bring themselves to turn off the faucet.

Cuz if my spouse killed my kids, the 1st thing I'd do is throw 'em in an oil tank. 
5723 2018-08-21 13:23:37 I'd be shocked if anyone came back and said don't use coconut oil at all.
5724 2018-08-21 13:23:33 It’s a vote so Walmart, Amazon and big oil companies CEOs get wealthier without paying one more dime to their workers. A vote did Rs is a vote against the independence of labor unions. It’s a vote against labor equality for men and women.

5743 2018-08-21 13:21:09 The worst the United States could actually do is plain out say: yeah bud I’m not buying any more oil and it wouldn’t make much of a difference since the Venezuelan government pretty much pawned the entire country to China.

In my defense: He did appear the better evil. And of course, he does still have his strengths. A GEJ government, I still argue, would have done more harm than good in the persistent low oil price environment. Said govt. walked us straight into it unprepared.
5764 2018-08-21 13:19:02 There’s no denying that renewables are in the early stage of life cycle; no different than oil & gas in the 1930s, & coal in the 1820s. Which is why we need improved investment. Is the end result “cleaner”?
5765 2018-08-21 13:19:00 So I rode with a colleague yesterday and the traffic was mad on vi. We got to a  point and he said he’s outta fuel and he needs to fill his tank. I said okay, so we drove in one Forte oil filling station and the guy said he’s not with his ATM card and cash

5784 2018-08-21 13:17:26 Disagree. Problem started with Hugo Chavez socialist agenda. He crowded out private sector by nationalizing oil companies, ran huge deficits through social welfare spending like free housing. Antagonized foreign investors etc.

You can make excuses about his ties to oil and coal, but we both know West Virginia isnt known for its banks.
5794 2018-08-21 13:16:28 No.  Into the corner with a dunce hat on. Where you belong.  In perpetuity.  You also get a fail in ethics, morals, values and life in general (as does any right wing snake oil salesman who uses those particular emojis).

Venezuela is a perfect place to know if you are reporting the truth or just making excuses for a corrupt anti American dictatorship that has bankrupted and starved the country with the most oil and energy reserves in the world.

6006 2018-08-21 12:53:03 Russian garbage is now occupying Georgia, Ukraine, Syria, working on Afghanistan (funding Taliban and today's bombing of Presidential Palace) and now getting their hooks into Africa.

6069 2018-08-21 12:46:32 Oil diffusers?
6070 2018-08-21 12:45:56 In 2015 Venezuela was declared a US national security threat? Why did we do that shortly after in 2014 learning Venezuela has the biggest oil reserves, I guess we’ll never know. It’s hard to do business when the US sanctions you, especially since oil is traded for US dollars

6082 2018-08-21 12:44:44 Sad but absolutely true. And will Putin let him? Seems keeping GOP in power will suit Vlad well: Arctic ice caps breaking in unprecedented way this year... GOP denial of climate change eases the path for Russian oil drilling and shipping across the north.  Match made in heaven?

6086 2018-08-21 12:44:22 He’s right. It’s like cleaning birds soaked in oil. You take a lump of coal, wash it with Dawn detergent and presto the coal is clean and you burn it.

6091 2018-08-21 12:43:57 So you think we should have let Iraq continue to rape Kuwait, steal the oil, move on to S.A., shoot missiles into Israel have Israel retaliate and then the whole Middle East explode? 
You know how many countries economies that would have destroyed due to lack of oil?

6139 2018-08-21 12:39:24 I've always thought, Scotland will eventually get its Independence but only once Westminster has used up all of our resources. Once Independent, England will then suddenly produce figures for the amount of oil they are sitting on in the English sector.

6159 2018-08-21 12:37:39 Refineries fon't make money without feedstock (oil) to make refined products.
When market logic trumps politics, this is what happens (local operators are buying oil from Russia). Refineries need feedstock. They do not deal with politics. They deal with demand and supply.

6164 2018-08-21 12:37:07 No one makes that argument because people understand that the Saudi system is propped up by huge oil reserves and a small population. The only reason people think the Norway model is feasible anywhere else is because of a lack of understanding of the system in Norway.

6187 2018-08-21 12:35:11 And yet will make Putin and other fossil fuel oligarchs gleeful: opening shipping lanes across the Arctic, easier oil drilling... #climatechange is terrible for most, but highly profitable for a few.

6193 2018-08-21 12:33:42 Currently, NG oil production assets are at less than 60% capacity. There are ongoing fights within the oil regions particularly the Niger Delta which makes oil production not to be possible.

6197 2018-08-21 12:33:29 Canadian crude and crude from Alaska have been the traditional feedstock for Pacific Northwest refineries. 

Now that production is growing and so are refining rates, local operators are buying oil from Russia

Canada, and Russia, makes for an interesting ironic political twist.

6209 2018-08-21 12:32:11 Poverty, in #Scotland, is a direct result of Labour Governments ROBBING the ONE Trillion in Oil Revenues from Scotland.

YOU spent their money in London and on Trident.
6210 2018-08-21 12:32:02 CNN or anyone else in the news media have never spoke about the Manafort trial being connected to Trump other than Manaforts relations with Russia. This is about tax evasion and money laundering. The Fox News crew reminds me of the Three Stooges.

6219 2018-08-21 12:30:32 I couldn't agree with you more. As long as the world uses Saudi oil and sells it arms, this will continue to worsen.
6220 2018-08-21 12:30:31 The refinery will help in ensuring Nigeria doesn't not import fuel but will not help in Nigeria's oil exports which I think Khathide is referring to. Nigeria's oil production is largely affected by politics and inefficiencies rather than infrastructure.

6226 2018-08-21 12:30:01 Is the geology that dredges up oil to make fuel and lubricants making cars work legitimate and the geology that points to evolution irrelevant? 
Do you think there is some overlap in concepts between the two?

All paid for by Scotland's Money.

Coal, Steel and Shipbuilding DESTROYED, food banks instead.
6259 2018-08-21 12:24:58 What's funny is that the US is actually in the unique position where it *can* completely devestate Venezuela's economy, as the US is the primary purchaser of Venezuelan crude oil (Which is of a type that can't be easily refined by other countries).

6263 2018-08-21 12:24:19 It’s altered to suit an agenda. If there is a disagreement with anything from halal meat to protection in exchange for oil (reason they hate the west) they call jihad. It’s not holy it’s an excuse to cause hate on something to suit at that time. Struggle is disagreement to them.

6266 2018-08-21 12:23:58 None of them, that’s the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won’t come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn’t impress anybody around here.
6267 2018-08-21 12:23:54 ConocoPhillips reached a settlement with Venezuela’s state-owned oil firm PDVSA to pay $500MM then pay the rest of the amount that the struggling Venezuelan oil company owes to ConocoPhillips will be paid quarterly over a period of four and a half years.
6268 2018-08-21 12:23:49 Obviously based on global adoption which is heavily influenced by petroleum producers lobbying of major governments like US. Trump reversed all of Obama’s clean energy policies and MADE renewable energy materials (ie solar panels) expensive through tariffs. Oil is NOT the future.

6334 2018-08-21 12:15:51 I slept all day yesterday bc I didn’t feel well now I’m up real early getting an oil change. I need coffee.
6335 2018-08-21 12:15:35 Learned about the Osage Indians of Oklahoma last night. They purchased land and found out their was oil on their land. Later they began to be killed off by the people from surrounding areas.

6343 2018-08-21 12:15:03 What kind of soap do you use to clean the coal?  I've been trying Dawn, which is used to clean animals in oil spills, but it's not getting my coal clean! I guess I'll switch to Palmolive and hope that works, but I'll be waiting patiently to hear how you clean the coal!!

6377 2018-08-21 12:10:34 The majority of people out there are truth tellers.  You choose to follow a BS artist. A little secret (it really isnt), the one profiting off of their version of the truth in odd ways is a sign of a snake oil salesman. Hes an Alex Jones wannabe.

6385 2018-08-21 12:09:37 US stock futures are up 0.2% with both Europe and Asia higher.  Oil is $67.17 with gold at $1,200. Markets seem inclined to rise today.

Socialism is the next progression after Capitalism, it can't happen in a 3rd world country even if it does have oil. Go to a library do some research, move along!
6388 2018-08-21 12:09:17 I’ve not been bent and broken in the political winds nor seduced by snake oil salesmen. Better to be one small light in the darkness than consumed by a blabbering black hole.
6389 2018-08-21 12:09:14 wait so did you not have bed bugs at all? whew...

you want to get a lice comb and coconut oil so it's bearable. shampoos have like 40% efficacy, although that might be higher in Europe.

6392 2018-08-21 12:08:19 Notice I qualified with 'reasonable' and knowing what they're talking about. Peak oil nutters knew lots - but they couldn't see the 'helicopter view' - the perspective. Gas, in the 50 year transition perspective, is critical. Take a helicopter ride.
6393 2018-08-21 12:08:15 Have you considered the ergonomics of holding and pouring the oil? Second from right would be a nightmare.
6394 2018-08-21 12:08:06 We use Co2 extraction to make our CBD oil (the cleanest way to do it) and as we are a small company it's extremely important to us that it is the best on the market - check our our website to see some of our great customer reviews!

6399 2018-08-21 12:07:42 exploitation by capitalists in the US hurt the country, and they tried to break away by socializing their oil similar to what Alaska does

The net result was economic blacklisting, decimating the country, which allowed capitalists to use  them as an example for non-compliance

6406 2018-08-21 12:06:33 About #nutrition confusion is that it’s always put forward as meat vs. carb whereas whole food #plantbased #lifestylemedicine docs never advocate high glycemic refined carb, sugar or oil.

6407 2018-08-21 12:06:28 I am talking about post Saddam Era now that westerners occupy them and milk on the oil and their business interests in Iraq. Its very similar to british in India. Also general Indian wasnt very much fan of Rajas or Sultans when britishers came in.

6410 2018-08-21 12:06:03 Hemp oil has been discussed with one of my drs and given the go ahead. But I have to consult with my others and get some guidance.  It gets a little tricky with the neuro mess I have going on. 
6411 2018-08-21 12:06:01 Its about the industry. Not its cleanliness. Too much money is tied in oil and coal.
6412 2018-08-21 12:05:58 Muslims want to abolish ICE. Muslims want to destroy statues. Muslims want open boarders. Muslims push PC culture to destroy culture. Muslims strive to control oil countries. #ShariaKills any questions?
6413 2018-08-21 12:05:47 There is NO SUCH THING as "clean coal." It's a political phrase you use to support coal as an energy source.
True "clean coal" requires carbon capture and storage, which you do NOT support! That goes against your #climatechange and science denials & would/reduce coal/oil profits.
6414 2018-08-21 12:05:39 Im not justifying it. Its pretty much a fact, and one I have knows for a long time. When the economy is bad, oil prices go down due to the lack of demand. I never trust good numbers when oil prices are low. There are plenty of stock market people who know this as well.
6415 2018-08-21 12:05:34 CBD oil is going to transform me into a completely different, much better person right?

6420 2018-08-21 12:04:31 My demo from my workshop last week in Vail, CO at the alpine garden. Had to add a bit more color since the blooming season is about over there. "Garden Varieties" 8X8 oil. #oilpainting #Flowers #Garden #Colorado #art #pleinair
6421 2018-08-21 12:04:29 But TJ MAXX has the natural oil rosehip face serum instead of the cold pressed one.
6422 2018-08-21 12:04:25 You have a good point doctor as dietary recall is notoriously poor and subject to recall bias. As far as oil, bery rarely use that. No wheat at all so no white bread. A more reliable way would be to take photos and have them independently checked for food diary. The sad thing...
6423 2018-08-21 12:04:19 Add CDB oil. “It’ll cure your pain, depression, anxiety, and make it rain kittens and puppies that fart rainbows!”
Tried it. It did absolutely fuck-all except cost a crazy amount of money that could have been better spent on a year’s supply of Advil.
6424 2018-08-21 12:04:15 Try using the Sherman Antitrust Act against them.  It worked against Standard Oil and Ma Bell back in the day.  Surely it can work today.

6448 2018-08-21 12:00:48 The Jewish origin of the fish seems probable. Deep oil was not a particularly British medium for cooking, ancestrally I mean. The Jews ate it cold, as stated, I remember this from my youth in Montreal. But IIRC the chips part is usually ascribed to Belgian or French influence.

6468 2018-08-21 11:58:57 It got oil rich and just imported everything. That's not a failing of socialism, it's a failure of diversification.

6478 2018-08-21 11:58:12 Ha I hear ya. Does yours leak oil from everywhere too? Asked service manager if they sold a holder for a 405l drum to gravity feed oil into the pig. Thank god we have 2 machines and the other isn’t a Massey. Ran a 9220 and 2 9430s now and they all leaked. #macdon #losemymind

6490 2018-08-21 11:56:24 I prefer oil finishes. They work so much better with the wood. The most important step is prep, and then a light sanding between coats

6492 2018-08-21 11:56:15 Suggest,that egg yolk doesn't need to be added with milk,because it is too dilute to allow the bread to be covered by the egg yolk.
The oil temperature can be high,about 190 degree,so that the egg yolk quickly solidifies.
it tastes better with syrup and butter when eating.
6493 2018-08-21 11:55:50 Did they ever pay royalties on high sea or even doggerland  oil?
6494 2018-08-21 11:55:47 Sorry, we have both Lamborghinis with us here in Wexford. Also, our Maserati is up on blocks in our front garden  among all the used oil drums. Sorry.

6496 2018-08-21 11:55:21 Devaluing the currency wouldn't have saved Nigeria. Low reserves, low oil output and low prices meant we were heading for doom. Egypt devalued, venezuela devalued, Angola  lifted pegs yet they all tasted recession.

6631 2018-08-21 11:38:21 To be picky, 28% of our supply comes from Sasol. Saudi is 45% of oil imports so it supplies 32% of our oil.

And we don't supply billions of pounds worth of weapons to Saudi to use to terrorise the Middle East.

6642 2018-08-21 11:37:23 From my new book, OIL and GOD
With the demise of the Ottoman Empire (1918), control over religious extremism was lost. By 2018, the ME is a mess: Wahhabi SaudiA was formed (1932), Israel was born (1948), Khomeini won (1979), 9/11/2001, Shi’ite Crescent emerged (2003).
6643 2018-08-21 11:37:15 The US has sanctions against Venezualan officials, there is some  against the state oil company and restrictions to US finance.  That's not a 'blockade' by any definition - the US must wish it was that powerful.   I fear it is you who may have intellectual troubles.

6668 2018-08-21 11:33:39 There is also a massive amount of tax gained from oil derived products, likely more so than tax gained from crude.

0 - Will not clog pores
1 - Low likelihood of clogging pores
2 - Moderately low
3 - Moderate

6762 2018-08-21 11:18:25 Lol. I was thinking we'd just economically subjugate you and get your corn that way. No need for your oil. We'd bar you from using it.
6763 2018-08-21 11:17:59 I keep my IG feed pretty clean, I only follow a few people I know and the rest are just for the pictures. The essential oil ladies are the current irritation. Everything can be cured by essential oils according to the woman who doesn't know how to properly use the word seen.

6767 2018-08-21 11:17:27 There Is no solution with the measures taken by Venezuelan Government. The low production of oil and goods, high public expenses,   injection of  huge amounts of inorganic money, universal increase of 3000% of salary will not only boost hiperinflación but also recesion.

6774 2018-08-21 11:16:14 And the fields get sold for housing as not all can be used for human crops. Most farmers now grow plants needed for oil, that’s just as bad if not worse

6776 2018-08-21 11:16:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, but the duty to stop it cold and she didn’t do it.

6784 2018-08-21 11:15:27 They also fail to mention that most business & industry in Venezuela is privately owned, isn’t socialist & the financial issues come from an over dependence on oil & vengeful US (biggest importer of oil in the West) sanctions.
Latin America either falls in line or US intervenes

6809 2018-08-21 11:11:10 So i bought foundation booster from alha alfa. My thoughts are

1. It does make ur face glowing without wearing any highlighter.
2. You only need one drop
3. Your face doesn't feel sticky compared to if you mix ur foundation with argan oil/maracuja oil from tarte
6810 2018-08-21 11:11:08 So because we can’t refine our own oil means we don’t produce anything ? Clothes , food, apps, makeup brands etc... because we haven’t been presented with the opportunity doesn’t mean we can’t

6825 2018-08-21 11:07:39 The 2+2 might discuss this. The question is not just strategic autonomy but solutions that would be economically viable for both India and Iran. India is also stocking up iranian oil and is looking of a solution as is China. Maybe it can be worked out together.

Equal access to a place to sleep is.

6838 2018-08-21 11:05:56 I think 5.29 would be some of the highest I've ever seen here. When it soars like that I think Mexico might be a bit cheaper but our gas is pretty cheap other than oil countries.

6853 2018-08-21 11:03:49 I have done plenty of research thanks, that’s why I know what your saying is absolutely ridiculous. Palm oil is destroying the rainforest with many other things such as feed for cattle in this country. Also logging is one of the main causes. Not reduced meat consumption.
6854 2018-08-21 11:03:48 It could! If the political will were there. It’s what most people want. our politicians have sold off everything not nailed down! When Norway made a wealth fund for the nation from oil revenue Maggie pissed it away in tax cuts. When EU nations protected industry we let ours die.

6902 2018-08-21 10:53:48 Knuckleheads who think it's just about oil in Venezuela, just like in Animal Farm, the government in charge screwed it's own people by stealing the country's money. Which is why these type governments never work. Somebody's always in charge living better than the ones below them

6920 2018-08-21 10:52:04 Putin wants Russia to be more successful.  Our problem is that U.S. & Russia are oil & war-based economies.  This formula has lead to way too many world conflicts.  The wealthy super powers did not learn to share...or even discuss sharing.  Beware of those that detest fairness.
6921 2018-08-21 10:52:02 Changing BOST’s mandate is never a solution, trading of oil is not done in board rooms by politicians and social commentators. Govt roles is to ensure that all stakeholders including itself are performing their functions well and the effect would be seen long term.

6926 2018-08-21 10:50:26 Without our large acres of farm and ranch land people in densely populated states like OHIO would not have meat, cotton for clothing, grains, and oil & gas ... seems like a fair trade off in regards to people per sq mile.

7000 2018-08-21 10:40:24 Not necessarily: we can submit our own schedule regardless.
Problem is we cannot simply copy EU one (no need to protect olive oil etc) and needs agreement from all other WTO countries.
E.g. Russia took 18 years.
It is unlikely that other WTO countries will not want extras.

7030 2018-08-21 10:36:26 Norway being self-congratulatory on its worthiness, whilst forgetting, for example, Arctic oil drilling, and the fact that it's forest & climate programmes are wrecking the livelihoods of some of the world's poorest? How unusual....

7043 2018-08-21 10:32:57 Venezuela had oil the Chinese and Russia wanted and this held things together til Obama made a deal with Iran for nuclear disarmament and the Saudi's got scared and opened the oil taps wide and flooded the market with oil causing a collapse in oil & Venezuela

7045 2018-08-21 10:32:14 There is no oil money anymore. They generate insane amount of revenue which is why they don’t stick with FFP

7059 2018-08-21 10:29:01 The GERS report at best is a colonial construct to satisfy the London exchequer. Scottish  exports sent abroad via the M6 are not included and as for the oil revenue...Norway grossed 17billion last year and UK 60million+.  OFF VIRTUALLY THE SAME OIL FIELDS?? 
Who is kidding who?
7060 2018-08-21 10:28:45 under UPA potential NPAs where all hidden under the carpet. The same was the case with fiscal deficit which was kept low artifically by deferring the payment of Iranian oil.

7063 2018-08-21 10:27:58 LOL ... "Scandinavians are on same side as Venezuela"  WTF?

Venezuela is a mess - Maduro is a despot. The oil price crash has hobbled the economy. Under Chavez, Venezuela was a different place.

The trading-range could also be called a triangle with its lower-highs and higher-lows, but no matter what you call it, we’re balanced and trading sideways…
The range tells me to fade the breakouts.

7082 2018-08-21 10:24:47 So funny. Notice how oil prices are up? That is because the economy is up, and it also means that people in N Dakota are working oil riggs providing for their families. So are steel workers. Even better, we do not have illegals taking unskilled jobs from Americans who need them.

So, you're saying that Putin wants...
-Increased defense funding by NATO
-a loss in Syria
-Sanctions for poisoning political enemies
-Increased natural gas exports that tank the price of Russian oil and hurt their economy

Well.  On the subject of unintelligent replies...

7096 2018-08-21 10:21:34 '£4.9Bn pa oil & gas subsidies'

Really? Show me. Is that nett of VAT, Excise Duty and PRT? Or before?
7097 2018-08-21 10:21:30 #ThembiMajola: An example is the case of Iran. When sanctions were reinstated it meant companies that had invested in new refineries, meant to refine Iranian oil, were banned from doing so because of sanctions; they were working at a loss. So political stability is also important

7103 2018-08-21 10:21:02 Yes, however Iraq’s gdp can be attributed to an 11 year invasion where the publicly owned oil was privatised, so that’s excusable! The Greek should look at why they required a bailout to begin with, the Greek government have a lot to answer for

7119 2018-08-21 10:17:58 The termination was deemed as a right decision as the state oil company is a well-run company and does not require an advisor...yup no easy money please!
7120 2018-08-21 10:17:41 Probably not. Investment v risky! But it's more the ability to trade & function that is crippling the state oil company in Venezuela. Sanctions on its executives and access to debt means can't finance itself, so exports are crashing. Not socialism, but USA economic warfare.
7121 2018-08-21 10:17:13 FYI if you live anywhere that has toum (garlic sauce) in the supermarket fridge GO BUY IT AND PUT IT ON TOAST AND PUT SCRAMBLED EGGS ON TOP. And make sure the ingredients of the sauce are only; garlic, oil, acid. You want smashed garlic basically.

7141 2018-08-21 10:13:38 It's gonna be ok. They (the proverbial "they") are going to let the Arctic get just mushy enough so we can get the oil out from underneath, then they'll put it back together good as new. No dramas.

7152 2018-08-21 10:12:24 As long Saudi Arabia has the bulk of the oil, no one is going to rock the boat. As for Trump, he's just another in a long line of US Presidents who nods very politely to the Saudis for this very reason. Ironically the other nation with massive oil and gas reserves is Russia.

7183 2018-08-21 10:07:18 Or for example ban heavy oil container cargo ships... that will achieve same results for trafic in like 2 years....

force airlines to pay VAT and consumption taxes on fuel (which will result in prices of tickets and shipping going up with substantial decrease of aformentioned)

We do allow motorbikes to be stored at all branches, but they have to be drained of petrol and oil before they are put into storage.
7227 2018-08-21 09:59:14 why do these snake oil salesmen sell snake oil you say?
7228 2018-08-21 09:59:12 it sounds exactly the sort of thing an evil sociopath would do certainly, why not call the police if he saw her do that? surely he'd want her to be punished, and why the oil barrel thing? he certailnly didn't look distressed at all in the video of him

7235 2018-08-21 09:57:40 Why can't Say stick to one country to buy oil,  we can atleast pay less,  look at Botswana they buy from us but they pay less what causes that
7236 2018-08-21 09:57:11 Where are we going to get money to repay loans how about asking our oil suppliers to defer payments on oil imports.
7237 2018-08-21 09:57:10 MAYBE THAT IDIOT IS TESTING THE PROCESSED COCONUT OIL WHERE THE LAURIC ACID  HAS BEEN DEPLETED.. If so, then he’s looking at TRANS FAT.. I’m an educator, not a Doctor, not a University connoisseur either but I know my body’s reaction to rubbish!!

7242 2018-08-21 09:55:02 Fair enough. So I hope you'll agree that when the SNP, based on information at the time from several sources, thought oil would be 100$ per barrell, that was also not a lie.

7249 2018-08-21 09:54:21 The country has no crude oil reserves, so the #FuelPrice problems are far from over
7250 2018-08-21 09:54:10 Embarrassing, but then liberals buy the snake oil of imPEACHment, fortified with secret Russian Collusion, by the truck load every day. So, whatever. It’s all about whatever makes us feel better about ourselves as individuals I guess.

7253 2018-08-21 09:53:56 Forgive my ignorance, but what are you actually protesting about? The well has already been drilled, we all rely on oil to survive, so why not make use of our own resources, instead of having to import so much of the oil the UK uses.

7284 2018-08-21 09:46:24 For me, the number one we should be more concerned about is anything from the petrochemical family, including oil, gasoline, plastics, etc. These products are polluting our air, oceans, and habitats  in monstrous quantities. Lead is also a problem. Sugar too.

7312 2018-08-21 09:41:02 Don’t go to docs until you’ve been doing olive oil for 2 weeks or they will say it has to be done or the next thing doesn’t work very well I found a straw to be good for inserting it. Dip straw in pot of oil hold finger over end release in ear. Careful of soft furnishings/bedding

7318 2018-08-21 09:40:15 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
7319 2018-08-21 09:40:15 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

7326 2018-08-21 09:39:33 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
7327 2018-08-21 09:39:32 Haha...the first episode of Newsroom was about the BP oil spill, which enraged me because I covered that. The Newsroom team got hold of stories in the space of a few hours that, in reality, it took multiple news orgs months to land.

7335 2018-08-21 09:38:00 Venezuela has only one industry/ export: oil. It imports everything. They buy lighter oil in $ to refine crude. Sell in $’s. Huge $ debt. They can’t print dollars! Result : $black market/ corruption. No diversification. Decline in crude price since 90’s. US oil war casualty.

7364 2018-08-21 09:33:06 Perhaps because they stuff you call snake oil is documented by medical studies to actually do what it says.  Yes?  You can always count on Ann Coulter to repeat stupidity as if defamation is always based in truth.
7365 2018-08-21 09:33:02 Correct - the first amendment does not require businesses to provide a platform for everyone to speak. It's how subreddits like TD delete any comments not praising Trump. It's why liberals don't speak at RNC conventions and environmentalists aren't invited to big oil pitches.

7380 2018-08-21 09:31:02 Well, it is not national recession, it is called GLOBAL recession for a reason. If obasanjo behaved like GEJ, we won't have escaped recession in 2008. How can you explain 4 years of global oil boom ending with depleted ext reserves plus increased debt under GEJ?

An Aharveda diet does not use oil, ghee, dairy products or sugar, yet it isn’t about eating boiled vegetables for lunch and dinner. 

In fact, you could be tucking into a mouth-watering avial or vegetable makhanwala, and gajar halwa.

7401 2018-08-21 09:28:31 PMB and GE *still*have countless exchange rates and continue to restrict exchange rates 3 years after the oil price crash. CS did so for 5 months even with reserves to 'defend' for longer. The difference, as they say, is clear.

7441 2018-08-21 09:19:38 Perhaps but not naming ministers for 6 months wasn't oil, nor were the actual crop of ministers named nor were the myriad of other terrible decisions and utterances. Oil historically has been much lower than the 80 it's been for 18 months or so.

Thank you for reporting this to us :-) Please can you confirm the location of this so we can pass the details over to our Technical Team to investigate this for you? 

Thanks, Leah
7463 2018-08-21 09:15:45 Oil is a highly politicized industry- it can elude to the security (for both us and the countries we trading with), it could be tied to a development agenda, it could be to strengthen relations etc.
7464 2018-08-21 09:15:30 All relative, though, isn't it @JeremyCorbyn? The socialist govt in your beloved Venezuela - which had more oil than Saudi Arabia - has overspent to such a degree that people are reduced to eating their pets of fleeing the country. Wrong type of socialism I guess ...
7465 2018-08-21 09:15:20 Oil is sedimentation A track movements also happens at a certain types of spinal level of fatal climate change anything in
7466 2018-08-21 09:14:57 Yes, coal reductions is robust . Growth in non-fossil, but could be wind, solar, nuclear, hydro, etc. Oil & gas linger in the system for longer than many assume. CCS important, particularly on bio. But, the relative weights of all these differs by model, so no hard / fast rules.
7467 2018-08-21 09:14:05 I wonder how easy it is to extract their oil =  #stockpiling for next year 
7468 2018-08-21 09:13:40 Quote from Joelle Gergis that didn't make it into my story: "Yes, we are the land of drought and flooding rains, but human activities, such as the burning of coal, oil and gas, have driven up greenhouse gas emissions which have been fueling global warming since the 1950s."
7469 2018-08-21 09:13:09 The opening was there though, thanks to the IMF crisis, oil prices, perceptions of trade union power, and the breaking of the Bretton Woods system by Nixon.

7491 2018-08-21 09:09:07 Reflection for floating oil
7492 2018-08-21 09:09:05 UK alone among G7 nations, dramatically increased its fossil fuel subsidies. Green Jobs are not costly, most are productive & add to GDP. Compare that with £4.9Bn pa oil & gas subsidies. Fracking is not lifecycle profitable. Employment does not mean people are not in poverty.
7493 2018-08-21 09:09:00 Today in 1959: President Dwight D. #Eisenhower signs a bill into law establishing #Hawaii as the 50th state. He wanted both Alaska and Hawaii to be admitted to the union, but want Hawaii admitted first. Congress, however, wanted #Alaska admitted first due to their #oil reserves.
7494 2018-08-21 09:08:50 Been doing oil for last 9 years with heat recovery but too slow heating water
7495 2018-08-21 09:08:48 Even as copycats, we make poor copycats. In this era of “global warming” coal has been tagged “dirty energy” to discourage its usage ignoring the fact that industrialized West is responsible for today’s global warming. Under sanctions apartheid RSA found way to convert coal 2 oil

7507 2018-08-21 09:06:57 That’s a fair observation Matt. You do get a little scorch when mix applied with UAN + Biopest. Biopest or equivalent parafinic oil is an important part of mix wrt sclero protection. If using just as adjuvant then reduce rate to 0.5%.

7588 2018-08-21 08:50:01 Socialism is an evolutionary process. There is no win/lose. There is a continuum along which humans develop meaningful ways of organising their societies, I believe we'll end up with a libertarian socialist model. Israel's already lost, once the oil in the ME runs out it's over
7589 2018-08-21 08:49:58 Ay true maganda yung tai chi! Yun yung may chili diba? O iba yun hahaha  yung de-roll on na efficascent oil maganda daw pero wala dito samin :(

7596 2018-08-21 08:48:01 I don't know about the 1950s, but I sure as hell will never forget the 1973 Oil Embargo and the severe long term damage it did to the US and its economy for many years.

7600 2018-08-21 08:47:28 Morally it may be ironic to eat crackers shaped like animals as a vegetarian/vegan, but few commercial animal crackers even contain milk, eggs, honey, or palm oil
7601 2018-08-21 08:47:18 Raw oil.
7602 2018-08-21 08:46:59 Most bread is already vegan, which is great! Just double check the back to make sure that there's no milk/eggs in it. The only exceptions are things like naan, challah, brioche... You can also avoid bread that has Palm Oil in if you want due to it's environmental impact.

7604 2018-08-21 08:46:48 Rubbish, you said ‘ee’ (IE Scotland)  ‘still have oil reserves left to explore’. This clearly means you think that there are still more oil fields in the North Sea.

7619 2018-08-21 08:44:58 #Radebe: Regime change in Libya in 2011 has led to production challenges. Libya went form producing 1.5 million barrels a day before the change in government, to 600 000 after. The recovery in the global economy has meant that there’s an increase in the demand of oil. #fuelprice
7620 2018-08-21 08:44:54 How do you think Putin feels about low yield nukes,INF research,having more troops in eastern Europe,an armed Ukraine,sanctions and losing oil business?  I would say furious

7632 2018-08-21 08:41:11 @5WrightStuff The 3-daywks @MarkLabbett refers to were caused by Saudi’s putting oil up in responses to US backing Israel, not Gov.
Leyland, etc lost out through lack of investment at a time when others DID invest

7635 2018-08-21 08:41:08 I'm not against anyone making a peaceful protest; I dislike people who deliberately intimidate and interfere. They have a right to protest not everyone is as excited about this as we are - but they need to do it right. They are no doubt also annoying the peaceful protestors

7645 2018-08-21 08:40:27 If we'd been intervening, we wouldn't have let them turn socialist and nationalize the oil industry.
7646 2018-08-21 08:40:21 Η Motor Oil βρίσκεται στα 19,56 ευρώ με άνοδο +0,10% και κεφαλαιοποίηση 2,17 δισ. ευρώ.
7647 2018-08-21 08:40:14 We've just learnt that the oil rich countries such as Dubai and them know how to hide their money.

7649 2018-08-21 08:40:09 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it

7651 2018-08-21 08:40:02 Decentralised renewable energy creates jobs, saves money is far harder to disrupt and it massively reduces pollution, for any politician sounds like a vote winner, left or right. Is it cynical of to think huge political donations from big oil to political parties effect policy?
7652 2018-08-21 08:39:37 When I say I had no eyebrows or edges a month a go I mean it! Nothing and using coconut oil day and night has brought them both back amazingggg
7653 2018-08-21 08:39:29 Then there's Oil + gas
7654 2018-08-21 08:39:24 My dad had a 1750 Sport() even as someone who had only just learnt to drive I knew it was utterly crap! It may have had a 5 speed gearbox but finding a gear was a lucky dip, very heavy steering and it used as much oil as petrol. And it went rusty. Very rusty.

7661 2018-08-21 08:38:28 #Radebe: Other less spoken about reasons for the rise in fuel prices is political instability. Political turmoil in Venezuela has led to a near collapse of oil production, Venezuela is under US Financial sanctions and is also a key OPEC member. #fuelprice
7662 2018-08-21 08:38:27 Yes, it's fine for Norway, it has kept its oil money & the standard of living is very high. It's a wonderful country, you should visit. Brexit isn't fine for us, not in *any* form.

7669 2018-08-21 08:37:37 So ignorant, the only country that really pays the oil is the USA.

7672 2018-08-21 08:36:50 A slow down? You need to check that graph again. Exports more or less stayed at the same level relative to GDP throughout the 50s and 60s. You can’t blame the oil crisis for that!  They began to soar after joining the Common Market, as it was then.

7675 2018-08-21 08:35:56 Yes. The #Goldcar rep tried to trick me to buy full cover. Then he told me to sign the car as being clear from faults without seeing it and promised it would be beautiful! It was covered in scratches and not even clean. It has an oil warning light and the main beam does not work.
7676 2018-08-21 08:35:29 #Radebe: SA imports 49% of its oil from Saudi Arabia,24% from Nigeria and 20% from Angola. In Jan 2016, crude oil prices was below 30 USD per barrel. In 2018 prices are around 80 USD. Oil prices have more than doubled in 24 months. #fuelprice
7677 2018-08-21 08:35:27 The oil paint no be easy
7678 2018-08-21 08:35:23 Thereafter, they'll head to Kalemngorok, Kakongu and finally Kainuk to sensitize the community to allow the transportation of the oil that's been slotted to resume tomorrow.

7682 2018-08-21 08:34:37 Pakistan's economic performance largely depend on international oil prices. I wish oil prices come down substantially. Previous governments missed the opportunity of getting rid of circular debt during low oil prices. @Asad_Umar

7685 2018-08-21 08:33:03 I don't leave the car to idle, but I generally don't go over 3000rpm until the temp has been warm for a while. I recently fitted an oil pressure gauge to the MX5 which is super helpful as you can see when the oil is behaving as it should for hooning.

7715 2018-08-21 08:29:42 I recommend a socialist government that isn't under a strict sanction regime for not handing over their oil to the US for free, e.g. China.
7716 2018-08-21 08:29:40 It actually started under Nixon and then passed through to Ford, Carter and Reagan. (1973-1982) 

The oil embargo made the problem much worse under Carter - but that was not the start of it. 

Also there were multiple developed economies suffering through it at the same time.

7719 2018-08-21 08:29:04 Doesn't matter, we are in EU. Left US in 72 for a better life in NL & saw that deteriorate starting with 73 Oil Crisis & later murder of Kirwin D. Q of L way down in UK & now Brexit which DOES threaten all EU. And real Nazis in Sweden where I am today.
7720 2018-08-21 08:29:01 We agree, we see a lot of snake oil sellers. The current system allows this to happen, we have been approached by the usual "Grand masters" of various unregulated quick fixes and purveyors of treefrog/lizard spit etc..

7736 2018-08-21 08:26:58 I've never tried your method, I guess that is why you get that texture. If you pour oil to the flour, what happens when the dough starts rising? Just skip the-oil-in-the-flour part and you will be alright.
7737 2018-08-21 08:26:36 Who is paying them to block oil exports?

Is that different than the companies paying to push through a pipeline that no business wanted because the financial benefits are not there?

Like the Koch bros, who are very involved in anti-climate change groups in developed countries?

7778 2018-08-21 08:17:56 Again, you're pointing to the point in common between both, not the differences. The extraction and burning of oil is the far bigger problem.
7779 2018-08-21 08:17:53 It's impossible because we're not remotely likely to suffer the same problems, unless we become oil exporters with a national debt in US dollars...

7858 2018-08-21 08:03:46 This doesn't justify Brexit.All he's doing is stating what we will need to do to survive. This snake oil salesman is trying to sell us a necessity by dressing it up as a virtue.

7862 2018-08-21 08:03:05 Energy or solar power could be delivered by every disruptor with schale. Given Tesla has a lot of schale it could make high efficient power stations at home. New energy is becoming commercially interesting.

Don't sit on your ending supply of coal, nuclear waste, gas and oil.
7863 2018-08-21 08:02:52 I usually give it 30 seconds before putting it into gear, then keeping it below 2000 until the coolant heats up. I then wait for the oil to heat up before taking it over 3 - 35.

How to pour in fuel

7938 2018-08-21 07:48:14 He buried his daughters in oil!!! It’s not about gender. He deliberated and chose these actions. It’s just a very very sad story...
7939 2018-08-21 07:48:03 It's obvious he killed all of them: 1) a normal person would not kill 2) he lied to the cops 3) he dumped the bodies in an oil tank 4) he has a mistress 5) he interviewed on TV to show his innocence 

All these indicate a psychopathic nature. A normal person couldn't do this.

7978 2018-08-21 07:40:35 And this isn’t up for debate. A cursory glance at the declassified records shows British elites hold contempt for human rights, ie, they’re a PR stumbling block to pursuing their real interests; oil, commercial, arms & power projection.
7979 2018-08-21 07:40:28 That's policies done badly, not bad policies. Norway did the exact same thing as Venezuela and they are fine.
The difference is Norway didn't spend oil money on social programs directly. They invested the oil money and spent the profits.

And Norway didn't get embargoed by USA.

7994 2018-08-21 07:38:12 I think it’s more likely we’ll be following our Nordic cousins. We have more to protect in terms of EEZ & oil installations than Ireland, whose neutrality has fairly unique origins. NATO membership is likely to be the majority choice IMO.

8002 2018-08-21 07:36:12 In America, lard is toxic because the pigs are fed large quantities of corn and soy beans, causing their fat to be chemically equivalent to vegetable oil. Coconut and olive oil are the only vegetable oils that are really safe, but butter and lamb fat are also highly saturated.
8003 2018-08-21 07:36:11 As a Floridian who has lived through the consequences of an oil spill- you have some cojones talking about 55,000 jobs. What that oil spill did to our state was an atrocity, it destroyed our economy & it took decades for us to recover. Your greed knows no bounds. We know better.
8004 2018-08-21 07:36:00 These zucchini muffins are my idea of textural perfection. They are beautifully puffy, but not overly fluffy on the inside. Can we appreciate the difference here? The zucchini keeps things moist, as does the olive oil (!!!), and the brown sugar gets a little extra caramely so

8129 2018-08-21 07:12:20 I understand you wouldn’t think it’s fair and im not one for handouts (I’ve worked in oil fields 100 hour weeks for 5 years) but is it fair that the very banks that’s stole trillions of dollars from US the citizens over the years still gets my hard earned money for my home? NOPE!

8184 2018-08-21 07:02:11 Much of it has to do with the price of oil. 90% of the economy it yield up in their huge oil reserve. When the price of a barrel of crude dropped from $100 to $50, it made the cost of other goods skyrocket. Throw in a concurrent housing crisis and you have a huge mess.
8185 2018-08-21 07:02:01 you wrap oil in batter and you can deep fry anything
8186 2018-08-21 07:01:50 That’s why we need to invest in nuclear energy, promote electric cars, and lose our reliance on Saudi oil!

8196 2018-08-21 07:00:29 The USD reserve currency status and dominance over SWIFT grants the US enormous power over China, as the Chinese are forced to hold USD to pay for things like oil. Obviously it would be in China’s interest if the USD lost its reserve currency status

8272 2018-08-21 06:46:49 Hey, I stopped using yankee candle as i was worried about them being unhealthy.  Have been using a oil diffuser they smell amazing with essential oils, my fav blend right now is lavender, geranium and Spanish majoram

8277 2018-08-21 06:46:18 Step right up ladies and gents. The pointless slogan nonentity man and the metropolitan unionist brexiteer will be touring the Northern colony for 4 days to purchase your votes. Snake oil is available to purchase on the day. Get it cheap before we are out of the EU.
8278 2018-08-21 06:45:17 I have a similar recipe to @BecksBake and it will last at least 5 days in the fridge and 6 months in the freezer. It prefers to be kept chilled if room temp is cool it will be ok but not in a heatwave, especially if you use coconut oil.

8281 2018-08-21 06:44:37 We did hit a Shortage, as I linked, where we did have a 'Need Buy'.

But that time-frame has long been past.  Fact is it's cheaper to get Oil from Canada, Venezuala, Mexico, Columbia and Brazil due to distance and logistics.

8296 2018-08-21 06:43:01 I was actually super productive today. I was awake before 7 am (something that never happens), went to the dentist.

8307 2018-08-21 06:41:41 Thanks Iran....but why can't Iraq, a country with huge amounts of oil, produce its own electricity? It couldn't be because the central government wants to give Iran a quiet payoff? Or just incompetence?

8324 2018-08-21 06:39:27 I remember reading a book called Economic hitman by an ex CIA agent who was sent to countries to de stabilise economies and if it didn't work, they'd fund and arm rebel groups to overthrow governments. That didn't work? Manufacture war for invasion. Venezuela has oil. Just saying
8325 2018-08-21 06:39:20 Why would India sell oil to Iraq? May be some arrangement for diplomatic missions/embassies in India of the respective countries .
8326 2018-08-21 06:39:15 I wonder then if the "Emotional Conversation "that was had was because of the alleged strangulation. What a pure evil sob! He killed all 3 and he knows it.

8405 2018-08-21 06:23:09 It doesn't. Oil is costlier to extract in our waters so less profit. McCrone is history, oil barely generating any money now. SG accept there's currently a massive defecit. I guess you won't believe GERS unless it's saying otherwise, like a year or two before referendum

8411 2018-08-21 06:22:24 Use rose witch hazel to tone every night. And also use oil on your face every night. Oil combats oil. Rosehip or sea buckthorn oil is good

8452 2018-08-21 06:13:35 The danger of this is perfectly highlighted by Salmond’s 2014 White Paper. He based his economic plan on the price of oil and just after the referendum the price of oil slumped dramatically. If Scotland had voted ’yes’ she’d be in severe economic distress now.

Saudi Arabia makes a better ally than enemy, especially when they have economic leverage.

8600 2018-08-21 05:45:42 Agreed. Just how much energy goes into designing and producing the car itself? Ho much into providing the endless infrastructure of the car (roads, gas stations, refineries, military to secure middle east oil, dealerships, ...) ? Future generations might curse us for this.
8601 2018-08-21 05:45:23 i'm sure there are tons of recipes/tutorials! i haven't delved too deeply into mixing my own blends but i'm p sure the main thing is just to have a carrier so you're not putting the essential oil neat on your skin 'cause that can be harsh
8602 2018-08-21 05:45:07 You can use some beard oil to give it a nice sheen

8639 2018-08-21 05:35:33 You see the two pipelines are different. The one PIA is showing is for crude oil. The UAE one is for gasoline. So Eritrea will get crude oil from Sundan, use the Asab refinery and then sell it to other countries.
8640 2018-08-21 05:35:33 Seems economy is now much more inelastic to oil prices because substitutes more widely available

8685 2018-08-21 05:25:59 Dismissing smart successful people of color who hold views that differ from your own as peddlers of snake oil or mere playthings of white people is pretty disrespectful.
8686 2018-08-21 05:25:57 Hope you also know that MMS Govt also faced Worst Global recession in 2008 and it least effected INDIA, world appreciates that. 

High Crude oil rate

8688 2018-08-21 05:25:14 We don't need oil... We have sufficient gas from sewerage channels...:-)
8689 2018-08-21 05:24:58 Well lets be fair. The PCs left the bank balance almost empty. The Heritage Trust Fund is a shame. The Tapcal Trust Fund must have got major donations from oil and company @OilGasCanada We should have more in savings. NDP had to catch up on infrastructure, stim economy. So far OK
8690 2018-08-21 05:24:50 No.Kids were killed over the weekend. He had time to put them in the oil. She was a rushed job. Her flight was delayed which limited the time more. He had to take care of her before he left for work. Which only gave him a couple hours and thats why she was only in a shallow grave

8700 2018-08-21 05:21:22 Venezuela, Iran and Russia are sweating , falling oil prices means less to eat for their people . Trump just used a left hook and after a couple of right had jabs. Will this be a knock out ?  Maybe for Venezuela.

8704 2018-08-21 05:20:11 A lot of people conveniently ignore that the dictator and his predecessor did enforce socialistic measures and did every play on the socialism book to stay on power and spread misery. Asking a socialist to develop the economy of a country (like diversify from oil) is a lost cause
8705 2018-08-21 05:19:40 Snake Oil salesman says Snake Oil has just doubled in value!
8706 2018-08-21 05:19:22 We have the fifth largest economy IN THE WORLD. We care about equal human rights, including for non-white people. We care about our environment. We are against grabbing pussies. We are the antithesis of you. Go sell your snake oil somewhere else.

8712 2018-08-21 05:18:21 Ouch ! Is any oil other than olive edible ? Especially for cooking. Asking for a friend. Erh, for me and my family in fact.
8713 2018-08-21 05:18:21 Nice try that's what they do. Trump is not invading countries and stealing Oil like the past two Stooges, just look what is going on today.

8720 2018-08-21 05:16:50 Snake oil salesman, DEFINITELY! Dangerous? Nah. He is a nutcase, but silencing him is the wrong action to take. Don’t silence, argue why he is a nutcase. Silencing him has actually given him more of a platform and made people more curious. He is now a martyr for free speech.
8721 2018-08-21 05:16:40 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?

Why don’t you try the same picture with a chicken and Cuban Peso!
May be you don’t know, USA doesn’t allow the technic materials for oil production to Venezuela, therefore there is a mass decrease in oil production of Venezuela..
8728 2018-08-21 05:15:46 We passed by an angel with 2 wings, made of oil. It gave us someones biggest secret.
8729 2018-08-21 05:15:43 Itulah i guna cleansing oil nak tanggalkan makeup. So far u still pakai ke makeup wipes tu?
8730 2018-08-21 05:15:15 Y’all gotta chill with Tiffany. That joke was dumb but I genuinely don’t think she knew who cAnola oil was before today. She just drew the short stick and had to say the prescripted joke
8731 2018-08-21 05:15:06 Salt/Pepper and Oil/Vinegar can make anything at Subway taste good. You could give me a slab of cardboard on Italian Herbs and Cheese with some S/P and O/V and I'mma down that shit

8738 2018-08-21 05:13:35 My skin was dry and cracky since two days ago. I used essence and hydrated skin care for keeping water balance on my face, not oil.

8740 2018-08-21 05:13:24 I'd be willing to be the majority of Americans would say the same thing--and would much prefer to shift to alternative energy sources rather than continue to murder for cheaper oil.

8748 2018-08-21 05:12:05 Sympathy for the Skin from Lush does wonders when my skin acts up, same with eating healthy fats like avocado and coconut oil + staying hydrated! If it's super bad though, get a prescription cream
8749 2018-08-21 05:12:04 And the magical cure for the headache was putting peppermint oil on the bottoms of my feet. Who knew?
8750 2018-08-21 05:12:02 @NimVedaAust our curly haired clients swear by our #Natural jojoba oil to reduce frizz, add moisture and maintain natural bounce while increasing curl definition. Give it a try - it's completely natural - #Nature's answer for beautiful curly hair :) #AffordableOrganic.
8751 2018-08-21 05:11:58 Yeah,. I wouldn't do that if I were you. I don't have an answer for you about your anxiety. I wish I did. I've been using CBD oil to help me sleep. It's very relaxing and I think others use it for anxiety.
Not much help right now but maybe you can look into it.
8752 2018-08-21 05:11:45 This is true,a farmer once devised a method of driving his car on methane gas of pig crap,he was offered an ammount of bribe for the idea,it was never heard of again,it was bought by the oil companies, it was a cheap

8789 2018-08-21 05:06:36 Lowest oil prices, continued economic momentum across the world. Despite this we had so many failures in the government schemes. Also stop playing victimhood Everytime. India was in a much better state in 2014 than what Modi and BJP build a perception of it.
8790 2018-08-21 05:06:28 The guy at the car shop called me and said “sorry Briana, your car engine exploded on us, there’s oil leaking everywhere, and almost caught on fire.” I’m like WHAT THE F HAPPENED?!

8806 2018-08-21 05:03:47 Venezuelan economy sinks down daily. Social welfare’s created a financial bubble which bursted. It was not backed up by economic growth as oil prices dropped down. Daily products aren’t affordable, hunger becomes normal, many in search of food go to garbage. Sad! Maduro - out!

As for the NPAs, the government has not released data indicating when the loans went bad. They might have gone bad ...

8825 2018-08-21 05:01:33 Problem numero uno. China has quietly been in Africa for years establishing infrastructure and relationships with these war lords. There are many thousands of gallons of oil& natural gas. Diamonds & other minerals. China doesn’t care about what human rights are being violated.
8826 2018-08-21 05:01:28 It’s all layered. I think aloe Vera gel alone simply dries my skin out so i add that first. The apply the rosehip oil next. It’s pretty absorbent so it won’t make me greasy. the moisturizer is last since it has an SPF in it.

8829 2018-08-21 05:00:59 Yes, N sea oil is an ’unknow’ variable that's the point. You can't bid your future on something whose price goes up and down with no way of safely predicting its future price. That was the problem with Salmond’s 2014 Whote Paper proposes for independence.

8835 2018-08-21 05:00:21 Not too surprising since HRC's point man for environmental issues in the Dem platform committee was an oil industry lobbyist. I was told this by a member of that committee. Like the GOP, all Dem presidents (& Al Gore, as VP) have worked against effective climate consensus

8869 2018-08-21 04:56:22 No! Not necessarily fish oil. They must be golden crusty exterior. Edible dough interior. 

Same thing as di chips. You can achieve same effect without deep frying. But using just air. Go to YouTube and see what I'm speaking of.

8887 2018-08-21 04:53:46 I think for the U.S. It boils down to which authoritarian regime should we support that will allow US corporations to profit there. Moammar foolishly thought that Libya could nationalize its oil and trade in something other than US dollars.

Bob, can I please get the Avalon in for an oil change with pick-up and drop off this week?

Wednesday I'll need my vehicle back by 5:30pm and Thursday I need it from 12:30pm - 2:30pm. Other than that, it can be kept all day any other day.

If there were no sanctions then the government could have borrowed to avoid paying principal and used oil as collateral.  Now the economy has no chance.

8969 2018-08-21 04:39:30 I’d be shocked if, other than Mike C who’s a different flavor of shitbird, any of these nerds are actually using their own snake oil

8987 2018-08-21 04:36:24 Fun fact: If the probe of your thermometer shows that the deep frying oil is ~180°C then that is also the temperature of the tip of the probe. Care should be taken when folding away the probe.

8997 2018-08-21 04:35:02 Yeah scratch the idea cooking with oil. There's air fryers nowadays. Can't stick to ancient ways of doing things if they not that advantageous at all. 

Fries(di chips) can be done in air fryer. Same process as frying magwinya. I might be on to something.
8998 2018-08-21 04:34:54 Then why throw their bodies in crude oil tanks!! Gtfoh
8999 2018-08-21 04:34:44 if coconut or tea tree oil can’t fix it then it’s probably permanent
9000 2018-08-21 04:34:40 Eat sardines for shiny hair. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Stress can cause hair loss. Is it NISIM or NHB? makes hair healthier. or comparable. What must I do to pin down the precise web site. Best in its class. So outstanding.

9003 2018-08-21 04:34:36 Sounds interesting, but my diet kinda restricts potassium intake in large amounts daily. Now I'm on salads without dressing but with just olive oil. Sometimes when i am feeling very hungry, i would add sardines, mackerel or tuna into the mix 
9004 2018-08-21 04:34:34 That's mostly xenophobia and nationalism. A dangerous cocktail when you're talking about an imperial power. 

The people at the top don't care about soldiers who die for their foregin expansionist ventures. Oil, weapons, and corporate profit over poor people who did nothing 2 us.
9005 2018-08-21 04:34:30 Baked magwinya? This is a first I ain't going to waste my dough, baking powder etc, if I want magwinya I use oil

9068 2018-08-21 04:23:45 Worth noting that birds die with coal mining due to deforestation and environmental degradation and with petroleum because oil spills and both because global warming, but yeah even disregarding that it’s cost/benefit analysis that results in “yes”.

9073 2018-08-21 04:22:23 Please, for the love of GOD, do NOT drink or do anything with castor oil. It can cause baby's bowels to relax to the point where meconium becomes a life or death issue for both baby and you...

9093 2018-08-21 04:19:38 #cbd #oil seems to be the gateway to #thc . Most patients I know who try cbd oil, love it but eventually want something with a little more “buzz” to it. They try higher #thc oil caps & never look back.  Most start with 3:1 (cbd:thc) but switch to 1:3
9094 2018-08-21 04:19:32 I stopped taking 9 different drugs for MS symptons just using a high concentrate CBD oil. It is obvious natural non patentable are no good for business. Also I felt like crap on the drugs, I wanted to just dissapear. Now I am back at the Gym lifting weight and doing cardio.
9095 2018-08-21 04:19:26 Ok so this man claims he strangled his pregnant wife who he claims was strangling her girls because he told her he wanted out of the marriage because he was having an affair. So naturally, you bury your family in oil tanks. Sounds about right.

9112 2018-08-21 04:16:26 Crude oil has honestly been a technical trader's dream lately. There's been a lot of good pullbacks/opps for people to hop on the swing short and a lot of intraday volatility for the scalpers.  Very curious to see how the rest of this week plays out #cl_f $cl_f

9121 2018-08-21 04:15:31 Ponder this. Electric vehicles will be common in 3 to 7 years. Oil demand will plummet. Green energy is here to stay and becoming mainstream. Coal is on the way out. Both Putin and the Kochs empire is based on these 2 fossil fuels.

9123 2018-08-21 04:15:10 Should we really be advocating for sustainable palm oil? It feels like to me, that if we keep buying Palm oil, burning of rainforest will continue and Orangutans will be wiped out. Say no to palm oil

9125 2018-08-21 04:15:04 Getting the landowners paid their back lease payments where the oil/gas companies vanished into thin air, is part of it, a small part, but needful. Room for it in the emergency royalty increase.

9131 2018-08-21 04:14:10 Apart from the oil price surge and the on-going trade war between China and the US is the factor of having selfish businessmen manipulate the prices of commodities in times of crisis.

Hoarders and Speculators, not the farmers, are to blame in the series of food price increases.

9251 2018-08-21 03:54:38 The problem with using mason jars as glasses is I just drank from the jar of coconut oil instead. This was a very Brooklyn mistake.
9252 2018-08-21 03:54:17 Roast it in the oven. With a bit of olive oil and salt. Keep turning it as it burns easily. just before it’s done grate some Parmesan on it.

9264 2018-08-21 03:52:38 always. i've been researching the Escarpments with Volcanic mapping + magnetic fields + oil & gas topographical mapping. coming to a very interesting summation...
9265 2018-08-21 03:52:36 Coconut oil hair mask. 
9266 2018-08-21 03:52:30 It really can help! See if one will let you try it before you make the choice because he oil itself can be a little expensive. It helps with pain too!
9267 2018-08-21 03:52:22 Tonight further proved that Canola oil's success and fame are being bought for her... like they mad it so obvious having her win over artists such as the carters and gambino

9278 2018-08-21 03:49:10 Modi had the Opty to really take it up to  double dgt with oil dropping and US and Europe rebounding. That he missed.
9279 2018-08-21 03:48:41 It was currency price controls along with excessive budget deficits that led to mismanagement. If Venezuela had followed a system based on the market and used oil exports as its means to fund its socialist programs they wouldn't be in this trouble.
9280 2018-08-21 03:48:18 So now advertising equals snake oil salesman?
9281 2018-08-21 03:48:15 The entirety of the   government’s social programs were designed to make the population dependent instead of helping them escape from poverty. These social programs could not be sustained by the oil companies revenues after the firing of 19,000 knowledgable workers.

9391 2018-08-21 03:33:24 PDVSA is NOT bankrupt or even close. It owns more oil reserves that your wahabi-jihadi neocon ally Saudi Wackobia.
9392 2018-08-21 03:33:23 Not only that, but if you look at the item of the greatest decreases, they correlate to times of great crises. For example, from 1970-1980,there was a huge oil crisis, n many ppl lost their jobs/homes. Same with 2000-2010. So reduction in homeowners is more abt losing homes.

9399 2018-08-21 03:32:16 CANOLA OIL REALLY JUST FUCKING WALKED ON STAGE WEARING A FUCKING PICNIC BLANKET TO ACCEPT AN AWARD FOR THAT FUCKING TRASH VIDEO
9400 2018-08-21 03:32:01 Yeah, we don't fear God anymore it's sad. Even Christians don't see the signs and times. They have let the oil run out of their lamps and we still have seven years to go if this is the start of the Tribulations.
9401 2018-08-21 03:31:55 Then why were the kids in the oil tank?
9402 2018-08-21 03:31:54 How tf does this happen?... canola oil should’ve lost... #VMAs

9414 2018-08-21 03:31:01 I don't get it either. And right, he put his precious children in an oil drum because they were his life. I guess an affair will soon become public
9415 2018-08-21 03:30:59 "we're out of oil!!" they cry. "please help us!"
Nicole turns to them and sneers, "there is no help for kuso commanders like you."
9416 2018-08-21 03:30:57 omg cod liver oil is so fucking disgusting, my mommy made me take that shit! supplements def won’t “cure” anything (as of now) and they don’t help with me environmental factors that impact your mental health (i.e. home life, work stress etc.) but they just add a lil extra boost!

9422 2018-08-21 03:30:34 want to undermine the authoritarian regime in #SaudiArabia who behead #HumanRights activists then support renewable fuel coz as long as we are addicted to oil the Saudi regime has the power it does

9428 2018-08-21 03:29:54 Real reason: Because of gas and oil.
9429 2018-08-21 03:29:53 Day 87 : The only major development today being Tun M's work visit to China and the MoU signed there in relation to Proton-Geely and Sime Darby Oil Palm Plantations.

9430 2018-08-21 03:29:37 Yes, but what will be the response of the legislature? The citizens of NC will continue to fund iconoclasm as virtue signaling.
9431 2018-08-21 03:29:35 This would be so great to win!!!  My mom uses CBD oil daily to help with the side effects of chemo!!
9432 2018-08-21 03:29:28 As far as I understand it, they do it in order to hv a relatively stable point for their new currency without compromising the sovereignty of their money since the cryptocurrency they used are owned by them n supposedly backed by their oil n gas reserves

But damn it's fishy af
9433 2018-08-21 03:29:18 So let me get this straight. We bomb countries for their oil. We interfere with legal governments for fun. Venezuela starts to succeed so we mess with their trade and impose sanctions. Now, when we have people fleeing from the situations we have created we should turn them away?
9434 2018-08-21 03:29:11 Lol it isn’t. You just need 2 litres of oil

9451 2018-08-21 03:26:27 He buried his pregnant wife in a shallow grave on one of his employer’s work sites, not far from where he dumped his daughters little, lifeless bodies ...into crude oil..., and left all 3 of them there for days, hoping they wouldn’t be found. 
This much he admits.

YES. I’m going to need them to come out with a mix of Epsom salt and Holy Oil...
9458 2018-08-21 03:25:18 How much CBD was in the 5 and the 10 drops of Metabolize oil and how much in each vial ? And how much CBD in 4 drops of Naked and how much in the whole bottle ? I think the bottle was 15ml.
9459 2018-08-21 03:24:56 If anything, we’ve gone backwards with @JustinTrudeau and specifically @cathmckenna with the environment. We’re choking in smoke out here for the 3rd year in a row and find the #TMX imposed on us and FN’s without approval. That’s before the expected oil spill!#climatedisaster
9460 2018-08-21 03:24:51 Real life examples of diversity without unity:

KKK and black communities in 1930s

South Africa during apartheid

Stalin and most regular Russians

oil/gas workers and The Beaches in TO 

Diversity without working together is not strength - it’s deadly.

9465 2018-08-21 03:23:40 The fact that he goes so far as to call it pure poison tells me this is a sham before knowing anything at all about coconut oil
9466 2018-08-21 03:23:27 @SenSanders How are we supposed to have faith in @DNC when they are willing to compromise on taking money from Big Oil? Is this some sort of joke to Tom and his gang?

9470 2018-08-21 03:22:37 Dooo it! If you have to change it out early because of your job it will hurt and you might get a stress bump, but just buy tea tree oil for it if that happens and you’re good!:)
9471 2018-08-21 03:21:56 This man is the devil. Now he’s using his murdered wife as his alibi??? He needs to be placed in oil while he’s alive and make him die that way. Bastard.
9472 2018-08-21 03:21:40 I'm beginning to wonder about actual snake oil.  The peddlers of old were considered "snakes" or "snakey." But, really, how about the oil? I mean, fish oil, good for health these days, Omega 3-6-9, and fish have scales and snakes have scale-y skin. Lizard oil? Salamander oil?

9476 2018-08-21 03:21:10 He put the little girls in crude oil. What other facts need to be gleaned.
9477 2018-08-21 03:20:58 I mean...I'm sure he didn't smell great, but have you ever had to bathe a Great Dane puppy (still 75 lbs) that drank 5 gallons of used peanut oil and is having constant diarrhea from said gastrointestinally disastrous decision?

9481 2018-08-21 03:20:24 I just spilled olive oil all over for one specific hoe:
9482 2018-08-21 03:20:14 Hear that CBD oil works for pain as well, even w/o the THC
9483 2018-08-21 03:20:10 Even Native American families torn whose land is being destroyed by oil pipelines.
9484 2018-08-21 03:20:07 I see - so natural is better - another fairy tale. The body has no idea if a chemical was made in a lab, extracted by hot oil from a hemp seed, or given by the gods. What you should be saying is dose, range, toxicity - and everyone is slightly different.

9517 2018-08-21 03:15:25 THAT LAST POINT IS THE POINT. We don't demonize Assad because we care about human rights. We demonize him because he has no oil and doesn't sell it to us.

that's why we need a realist foreign policy. We use human rights selectively to push the world around

9522 2018-08-21 03:14:31 not that hard, it's not like they were running out of money since this religious tourism business made a lot of profits (their 2nd biggest income after oil).
9523 2018-08-21 03:14:27 1/ The US has no one to blame but its own self. The CIA deposed a democratically elected #Mossadegh His fault? Nationalization of the only oil company - BP. After which the Brits coordinated an embargo against the country. In 1953 with CIA backing, the PM was deposed.
9524 2018-08-21 03:14:21 They finally broke down and let the cat out of the bag and let everybody know how they are going to stick it to wood and oil burners and to a lesser extent heat pump users. This will get ugly once that crowd figures this all out.

9527 2018-08-21 03:13:55 Well, he could have gone to Duke... named after a Civil War vet and slave owner.
9528 2018-08-21 03:13:43 Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world.  Right?
9529 2018-08-21 03:13:38 So sorry. Heard CBD oil can help with pain, contains no or little THC.
9530 2018-08-21 03:13:37 Bit of olive oil, garlic & salt and it will be even more cathartic.

9533 2018-08-21 03:13:25 If someone in America made blood pudding, but instead of pigs blood, pork fat, and nutmeg, they used beet juice, coconut oil, and allspice, the essence of a recipe that has a long tradition in English culture has been stripped. It's not blood pudding at all. Ingredients matter.
9534 2018-08-21 03:13:25 Whoa...I figured if dombolo is done in 12 minutes in a microwave oven it can be done in a baking oven. Well a golden crusty exterior with edible dough would be enough for me. 2 liters of cooking oil used at one go still sounds heretical to me. But that's me.

9556 2018-08-21 03:09:42 Yes bulletproof coffee! I use the recipe from a Fat Bomb book I got, it’s actually called Fat Bomb Keto Coffee and wow it’s so filling! It has 3 egg yolks in it, along with 1T of each: Coconut oil, Ghee, MCT, and HWC into 8oz of coffee, super filling I use Stevia to sweeten it

9563 2018-08-21 03:08:32 it's actually pretty good because u barely have to use oil! for tater tots and fries, i recommend just buying frozen and air frying than making by scratch!
9564 2018-08-21 03:08:27 People won't be able to get their cooking oil, instead the stores will be selling Russian lard and taste awful for cooking. The shortage of sugar,and that what happened in the past during the dictatorship of Ortega.

9574 2018-08-21 03:06:55 Move over oil, water is the new commodity to fight over! US and Mexico have been squabbling over the effects of climate change on Rio Grande’s water deficit and Israel-Palestine-Jordan are all drawing water from Jordan River, causing the Dead Sea to become even deader.
9575 2018-08-21 03:06:42 theangelinla, There was conspiracy/espionage as will be seen by Mueller when report completed. The facts/timelines are there. There was a Rosneft oil deal set up 4/27/16 at DC Mayflower Hotel. Trump needed to get sanctions lifted via Flynn/Tillerson early 2017. Pay attention!
9576 2018-08-21 03:06:38 We may still use coal power to charge for now, but that’s no more a problem then the tens of gallons of gas PER tank, the oil changes, antifreeze etc. We have to ween ourselves off. what u said is like arguing recycling isn’t worth it because it’s not 100% efficient. IT A START!
9577 2018-08-21 03:06:21 How did your day go it sounds full on I can't say my Tuesday was like that it kept raining so I've been in bed most of the day I gotta go pick up my car from mechanics and hope like heck it's fixed this time and no more oil drips onto the exhaust manafold under the engine

9582 2018-08-21 03:05:29 Oil is a very important product and the way we would live in the way the world revolves without oil we would not have plastic so if you want to eliminate plastic the car you are driving is a product of oil
9583 2018-08-21 03:05:09 I miss my oil changes being free 
9584 2018-08-21 03:04:51 I’m less strong on the Chaco War, although I think the Royal Dutch Shell/Standard Oil explanation has been challenged (but not trumped) by an interpretation based more on undefined borders, intra-regional rivalry and political miscalculations in  and 
9585 2018-08-21 03:04:42 I support this. See if Home Depot across the way still has any in stock. Also check the painting department for P95 (oil proof). They are hotter but better than nothing if they are out of n95

9598 2018-08-21 03:03:11 You’re in the Oil Creek area each summer? Let me know next time. It’s fairly close, I’d love to meet up. 

At the visitor center there they have a ton of pictures of the old city. It’s really wild, a boom town and nothing. 

We go to the Laurel Highlands or ANF area to get away
9599 2018-08-21 03:03:09 There is no possible way that a father, who just saw his baby girls murdered, could drop their little bodies in an oil tank and then go on the news pleading for their return. His story makes zero sense.
9600 2018-08-21 03:02:51 I don’t defend people..I defend ideas. 

We live in an industrialized nation. We simply cannot have it both ways.

regulations used to cost us 70$ to produce a barrel of oil. 

It cost others about 15-25$

It was cheaper to buy it than to produce 

We can’t survive like that

9613 2018-08-21 03:00:55 Doctor, advice from a pro (kale field): Always blanch greens this hardy in water as salty as ocean, shock briefly in ice water bath, strain & squeeze out excess water, chop to reduce length of fibers. Done like this, always noms with just olive oil & extra sprinkle salt.
9614 2018-08-21 03:00:54 Always were, boss. Cannabis oils can be topical (see Tweed and Hydropothecary's current med products), and doesn't sublingual just mean you're putting the cannabis oil under your tongue?

9627 2018-08-21 02:59:28 Why in the hell does the music on this oil of Olay commercial go so hard??? 
9628 2018-08-21 02:59:27 flaxseed oil? No good?
9629 2018-08-21 02:59:24 Okay, this Oil of Olay commercial is really good right? I’m not the only one seeing this?

9632 2018-08-21 02:59:06 I need some tea tree oil ASAP
9633 2018-08-21 02:58:53 Can I use butter or oil in place of margarine?
9634 2018-08-21 02:58:46 I wonder if the oil pump generates sufficient pressure to deliver oil to both camshafts ... all lubs?
9635 2018-08-21 02:58:43 Ima punch oil of Olay for his dramatic commercial
9636 2018-08-21 02:58:26 I'm very tempted.  I have a bottle you can pump air into that sprays out a very light amount of oil and then I use the oven.  Is that sorta the same thing?
9637 2018-08-21 02:58:22 But in the real world of actual work, I.e., food, housing, construction, infrastructure, transportation, non-college men have to bust ass. Hot, sweaty, dangerous, strenuous jobs in slaughterhouses, fishing, farming, oil & gas, sewage, paving, etc.
9638 2018-08-21 02:58:08 How did "cutting the budget" work out for you, as$hole. Americans without clean water because you thought you could save a few bucks.

But NOOOO we shouldn't regulate corporations because this couldn't happen if they were in charge of things, like water or oil, huh?
9639 2018-08-21 02:58:07 This Oil of Olay commercial is hilarious.
9640 2018-08-21 02:58:03 Homemade: olive oil, Greek yogurt, jalapeño, lemon juice, salt, pepper, garlic. Can get you measurements if you want.

9647 2018-08-21 02:57:19 Until long term contracts are signed at significantly higher prices there’s nothing driving value creation. No different than oil trading at $30. Values of reserves in the ground are depressed and there’s nothing to drive higher cash flows for producers.
9648 2018-08-21 02:57:10 I have a confession to make, a while back a friend gave me a coconut oil lime sugar lip scrub and I found it when I was packing and it was all mushy bc of the coconut oil and the hot weather and I didn’t want it to get on anything so reader I just ate it. I ate the whole thing

9652 2018-08-21 02:55:58 And interesting that the man that killed a person that raped his daughter is in jail gear and the man that killed and carried his babies and put them in an oil bin is shown looking like the perfect family man. Curious, which site was this juxtaposition on?

9654 2018-08-21 02:55:51 The whole rationale is the old nationalistic argument of energy independence, but with a complete disconnect with reality: timeframe, costs, configuration and most importantly, supply.

Pemex oil production has declined steadily since '04.

Ah, and they want to put price controls
9655 2018-08-21 02:55:41 My line was when he was a birther. I abhor liars and charlatans. It's amazing how much hatred, fear and selfishness can make folks chug snake oil.
9656 2018-08-21 02:55:38 Does anyone take CBD oil for anxiety and depression?
9657 2018-08-21 02:55:38 Do you have proof that Obama (speaking of snake oil) was not born in Kenya?
And on George Soros have you seen the @60Minutes interview?
9658 2018-08-21 02:55:30 It turns out that fish oil has the effect of reducing your risk for Alzheimer's disease.

9663 2018-08-21 02:55:00 No. I am suggesting that they are pathetic. Propaganda sponsored by oil & gas proponents.
9664 2018-08-21 02:54:55 Good point, but as far as national security the issue comes to the Strait of Hormuz where a lot of oil and other goods go up and down that Iran putting up a blockade also working on Nuclear weapons is a no no. Mexico is not but we have plenty of issues with Mexico as well.
9665 2018-08-21 02:54:52 I was that way with oil painting......one day i just couldnt get what my mind saw, to come out on the canvas the same way it the frustration killed it, and i still cant make it happen when i try to get back into it.
9666 2018-08-21 02:54:23 The idea is solid -revamp and reconfigure- but the goals are just unrealistic. Stated plan is to have 100% utilization, but Pemex has not achieved that since 92. "Estimated" costs, for heavy oil configuration, of 550 kbd capacity of only 6 billion. It's nonsense.

9668 2018-08-21 02:54:17 To tell u the truth after reading these remarkable recoveries with CBD oil on FB even after their first dose, l am beginning to believe it cld be a placebo effect in many cases.  The mind is a powerful.  So many come back & say it stopped working!
9669 2018-08-21 02:53:54 Both of those sites tried so hard to be right leaning, but they showed their true colors. They just didn't have the moxy to oil it off. Good riddance.

Orange County, CA authorities separate epileptic children from their parents who used CBD oil to treat the disease. Never mind CBD oil is effective enough that the use of pharmaceuticals was cut in half and those children were improving dramatically.

9676 2018-08-21 02:53:18 Exactly! But with an accumulated oil revenue funded sovereign fund of $1 Trillion, Norway can provably afford it. No oil exporter on the planet,  other than Canada,  is sabotaging its own hydrocarbon industry.

9678 2018-08-21 02:53:02 Further, not only could another currency be used as the numeraire for oil sales, but so could anything else from paper clips to chicken necks, and from trout fins to feldspar.

9683 2018-08-21 02:52:32 Yeah, so he was so distraught over their deaths that he dumped their bodies into partly filled oil tanks.  Sick f***.
9684 2018-08-21 02:52:20 Idk why, but I like cooking scrambled eggs w butter.
Also, I like using butter instead of oil when I fry.
9685 2018-08-21 02:52:17 密室早弁ーーーwwwwwww
9686 2018-08-21 02:52:12 Will he actually promise to address climate change and not continue subsidizing oil and gas, and not support expansion of the oil sands as our country burns?
9687 2018-08-21 02:52:09 So as we buy Saudi oil Saudi is responsible foe the Road toll the utter bastards 
9688 2018-08-21 02:52:03 Paint...
I sometimes use my arm as a mixing plate x"D washing palette plates takes a loooot of time to remove the past paint TT v TT especially oil paint
9689 2018-08-21 02:51:54 On the plus side I got my soaps and oil doe , thanks ach @yahusefbenyahu 
9690 2018-08-21 02:51:42 War for oil is evil.
9691 2018-08-21 02:51:42 Orangutans are under immediate threat of extinction.  A big driver is Palm Oil plantations.  Look at the ingredients in products you buy and boycott Palm Oil. #RainForestDeforestation
9692 2018-08-21 02:51:27 Palmer's cocoa butter oil really does its job. My skin looks healthier. Or is it just my hormone messing around with me?

9694 2018-08-21 02:51:12 I bet my husband I could @HamillHimself to give me a shout out and lost multiple times...anyone know if YouTube shows how to do an oil change? 
9695 2018-08-21 02:51:09 楽しいからこそ早く風邪治してきます！
9696 2018-08-21 02:51:05 You've grown, you've made Mighty Number 9, and then y'all struck oil again. Waiting to see the next project from you guys!
9697 2018-08-21 02:50:51 How do you get oil out of a shirt !? 
9698 2018-08-21 02:50:41 Yes—Nat Gas—Very Volatile Trading. Not—for Beginners! 
Concur on $OIL—Longterm = Lower.  IMHO.
9699 2018-08-21 02:50:30 You don't really think they control world oil prices do you?
9700 2018-08-21 02:50:13 besides Amazon what store sells macadamia oil? lol
9701 2018-08-21 02:50:11 Ummmmm... so instead of calling the cops & telling that story u bury ur daughters in oil cans? Nope... ur a liar.. go directly to hell..
9702 2018-08-21 02:49:58 @TheJohnnyBlas change my oil
9703 2018-08-21 02:49:48 Oh I KNOW why...they gave him gold...they have oil....they have billions...everything @realDonaldTrump worships...along with a barbaric attitude about #women, #justice and the #rights of the individual...a match made in heaven.,..Donny and the Saudis
9704 2018-08-21 02:49:46 um dill, sea salt, and olive oil Triscuits are literally so fucking good you all should try them
9705 2018-08-21 02:49:44 I don’t know who this is for but I hear The Lord saying, it’s time to grab some Oil anoint the doorposts and every window in your home and your beds and walk the house and pray in the Holy Ghost when no one is home.
9706 2018-08-21 02:49:34 Me too. On the bright side your forehead will be oil free for a bit hehe
9707 2018-08-21 02:49:27 Wont be seeing that after tonight.  The decline has started.
9708 2018-08-21 02:49:21 お、いる…ッッ(パタリ
9709 2018-08-21 02:49:13 Georgia might have the advantage since it is used to burning the midnight oil #LLWS
9710 2018-08-21 02:49:01 I spilled vegetable oil all over the kitchen and have spent an hour cleaning up
9711 2018-08-21 02:48:52 Add pepper and a bit of red chili flakes along with the salt and olive oil .  #broccoliisthebest
9712 2018-08-21 02:48:51 I work for dōTERRA, an essential oil company, where can I send AJ some Eucalyptus and Lavender oils?
9713 2018-08-21 02:48:40 クソ暑
9714 2018-08-21 02:48:33 Wanna live alone on an island with my dog, exotic animals, and nothing but serenity. I want to grow my own fruits and vegetables and I’ll catch my fish via the ocean. My soap, conditioner, sunscreen etc will be coconut oil and I will paint, surf, explore, and meditator til I die
9715 2018-08-21 02:48:32 Watching the replay on Lucas Oil TV app before I go to bed tonight?
9716 2018-08-21 02:48:14 Oil looking vulnerable with continual fails into 66.80/68.25 area,  I'm still seeing retest 64.50/63.0/60.00/even 57.00 eventually a possibility. Whipsaw action ahead imo. Thx for ng compliment, just trying to help the little guy, it's a hard trade in ng, most shld avoid. ^5
9717 2018-08-21 02:48:05 This guy is so full of crap! so he kills his wife for killing the children. Then he hides the children’s bodies in gas/Oil tanks hoping they’d never be found. Fire up ol’ Sparky!!
9718 2018-08-21 02:48:05 Most likely a family whose patriarch discovered an oil well on his property while hunting up some food.

So they loaded up the truck & they moved to Beverly
(hills, that is).

They’ll be choking traffic on Sunset Blvd anytime now...
9719 2018-08-21 02:48:04 And @justintrudeau is continuing to subsidize the oil and gas industry, and is supporting the expansion of the oil sands.  He is abetting the destruction of Canada.
9720 2018-08-21 02:48:02 I don't use liquid conditioning but I use some activater or curly gel dry with a defuser and then oil it I have big corkscrew curls naturally They drive me crazy though so I ware it up in a rubber band My kids beg me not to cut it
9721 2018-08-21 02:47:49 I think I missed ot while i was getting my oil changed, honestly
9722 2018-08-21 02:47:33 I do, use Eden’s garden or Rocky Mountains Oil (RMO) 
9723 2018-08-21 02:47:15 A fresh oil change RT @HennyNHeineken: I wonder what a fake butt smell like.
9724 2018-08-21 02:46:52 Put some wild grow oil on it I bet it will
9725 2018-08-21 02:46:38 My eldest wanted to know how to make popcorn from a bag of kernels we had. I told her to put oil in a pot and add the kernels.

She put the pot in the microwave.

OK, she was only 12 ... but her 10-year-old sister ran to get me just before the fireworks.
9726 2018-08-21 02:46:33 UGH i feel u dude!!! mine used to get like that but then i started putting hella oils & moisturizers on my skin skdjdks like eczema fr eats that oil up !!!

9728 2018-08-21 02:46:25 All of my fucking oil just leaked out of my cartridge for my pen and I’ve never been this mad in my life before. I’m sick
9729 2018-08-21 02:46:19 Oh and coal & oil are black. Solved it.
9730 2018-08-21 02:46:06 Fiction.
If you make 50K, your break is $570, for a family of four, a couple weeks groceries.
Rich get much more.
Promised wage gains barely there, and already wiped out by inflation, caused in part by his tariffs and Iran action driving up oil prices.
Deficit growing.
#MAGA?
9731 2018-08-21 02:45:41 I read somewhere from a UK analyst who said that oil was 30-40% of GDP in the 90's & that it actually fell to 15% as a percent of the economy, even while the price went up. Maybe the difference isn't that wide but it's somewhere around there.
9732 2018-08-21 02:45:36 It’s better to use someone else honestly. I sell bath and body products with hemp oil. They shut me down and kept my money stating I was selling drugs. No it’s soap and lotion with hemp oil.
9733 2018-08-21 02:45:33 Imagine this... rather than a multi billion investment into another pipeline, you take half of that to create training and education programs that give these oil workers the tools they need to build and make Canada a world leader for renewables.
9734 2018-08-21 02:45:33 I scheduled an oil change and also calculated when I need to get my tires rotated so I feel pretty good at being an adult right now.
9735 2018-08-21 02:45:29 Oh Hell here come the greed and Pesticide laden Government weed this LP  easy bake oven oil and Hemp Beer may not pose a health risk but if you  smoke your dried cannabis be fore warned they spray 20 HC approved  pesticides & cook their dried weed in Gamma Radiation DO NOT SMOKE.
9736 2018-08-21 02:45:14 What's confusing about it?
If men got pregnant, there'd be birth control in the water supply.
If men got pregnant they could get an abortion while getting the car's oil changed. This week's special: 1/2 off the oil change when you get an abortion! In and out in 30 mins!
9737 2018-08-21 02:45:14 For aftercare, try using a massage oil
9738 2018-08-21 02:45:10 Pesquisei sobre o sino. Toda vez que o visitante do Lucas Oil Stadium está no 3rd down, toca Hell's Bells do AC/DC. #NFLnaESPN
9739 2018-08-21 02:45:06 Obama could clean up an oil spill and Trump would enact an executive order to build an oil pipeline to dump oil directly into the ocean.
9740 2018-08-21 02:45:04 Its not really construction,  oil boom, pipeline shit
9741 2018-08-21 02:44:50 Todd Eklof, who was the prime sponsor of the coal and oil train initiative last fall, supports the ordinance. Calls the contention that ecological, environmental concerns at odds "a lie."
9742 2018-08-21 02:44:45 Anyone use CBD oil and have any advice/etc? Just starting using it to hopefully ease my panic attack’s, anxiety, paranoia, etc. that i’ve mentioned before.  Went off of my prescription medication earlier this year & looking for advice thank u lmk
9743 2018-08-21 02:44:45 my sisters really testing me , she threw cold water on me while i was showering then she put oil on the floor so i could slip when i get out 
9744 2018-08-21 02:44:45 You might get more serious acceptance if you really dug into Knudsen's big wound healing study - used sugar and vegetable oil - always works.
9745 2018-08-21 02:44:36 .
Motivational speakers are sociopaths.
They sell drugs, sneak oil.
The Western concept "always happiness" is unattainable,
A tyranny, that send people into depression & much more;
No one can be as saccharine as the pretenders.

I got so much hate mail 4 saying that 
#BeHappy
9746 2018-08-21 02:44:26 Because a normal Dad would just stuff his dead children in an oil tank? WTH
9747 2018-08-21 02:44:20 Come around me smelling like tea tree oil and get cuffed
9748 2018-08-21 02:44:09 Electricity is generated through furnace oil & gas. We have to borrow excessively to keep power plants running. PMLN didn’t do anything to manage that issue which PTI is supposed to resolve immediately
9749 2018-08-21 02:44:00 I think a big get well soon card for all the drivers and teams to sign would be appropriate.
9750 2018-08-21 02:43:46 LMFAOOOOOO my cousin said that something pour hair grease or gel on her phone. So her solution is to put anointing oil and pray on it She’s too Nigerian
9751 2018-08-21 02:43:27 Good oil! 
9752 2018-08-21 02:43:23 Maybe if Balor did the baby oil routine pre-match, Roman would just slide off his belly when he tried to spear him?
9753 2018-08-21 02:43:20 I’ve been killing myself off this new oil pen i cop Friday this shit really be having me sailing all day 
9754 2018-08-21 02:43:09 I love kale as well. I like roasting kale with a little salt and grape seed oil. It isn't unhealthy. Lately, I keep making arugula salad every other day And I am a big fan of avocados.
9755 2018-08-21 02:43:05 Erdogan knows very well how Turkey is the #quintessential East-meets-West strategic connector across Eurasia.
 And he knows what’s he’s really “#guilty” of: buying the #S-400s, .. advancing Turkish Stream and insisting Turkey will continue to buy Iranian oil.

9756 2018-08-21 02:43:03 Potatoes are enemies of civilization. 

Wherever they are found we flay off their skin, quarter them, and submerge them in boiling oil.

Positively medieval.
9757 2018-08-21 02:42:55 Eastern Canada buys oil off these pigs and it makes me sick, #Liberal headquarters in Quebec and Ontario loooooove their dirty Saudi energy.
9758 2018-08-21 02:42:50 @catherinemck9, wow can you ever talk nonstop! Heard your interview on @CBCEarlyEdition today and you said so much but also nothing at all. Is that part of ‘the overall plan’ too? You cannot protect the environment and expand oil production! Does not make sense! #protectheinlet
9759 2018-08-21 02:42:45 turned the tv off right after ariana was done because i knew they would do something stupid like making canola oil artist of the year. whew the ghetto
9760 2018-08-21 02:42:42 I crunch up mint Tic Tacs with my teeth until they are a paste. Then I rub them on my lips.

The sugar scrub and mint oil is very good for them!
9761 2018-08-21 02:42:41 I have thick 2B hair and it woks pretty well for me, although all it really does is smooth my hair down and make it shinier. coconut oil works much better for frizz
9762 2018-08-21 02:42:31 Definitely snake oil out there, but, don’t lump all who use natural forms of medicine into 1 category. Plenty of Dems, Independents & NPA’s, etc, seek out MD’s w/an Integrative tool box bcz one pill doesn’t always fit all & most plant based med consumers are not alt-right idiots
9763 2018-08-21 02:42:17 I have had to terminate an employee in a safety sensitive job for a positive test result. He was using CDB for pain after shoulder surgery. Hemp oil might pass, but maybe not.
9764 2018-08-21 02:42:15 @sfloridastorm
A glut of oil in the USA & gas cost goes up because of Trump import tariffs?  Seems that free enterprise would better help the middle class & businesses that will suffer this winter from high energy costs!  Allow us to compete with our allies as well!  #TariffWar
9765 2018-08-21 02:42:10 The BP oil spill was an inside job, funded by Big Dishsoap companies

9771 2018-08-21 02:41:00 Pay the Oil as everybody else, stop destroy countries and kill people to get it free. Stop the embargo to Venezuela. And stop advocate for thieves.
9772 2018-08-21 02:40:37 リナちゃんどした？考え事か？可愛いけど無理すんなよ？(なでなで
9773 2018-08-21 02:40:30 Turns out eating all that coconut oil is basically poison, according to new research. What’s next? Essential oils don’t work and kale can’t make you live to be 1,000?
9774 2018-08-21 02:40:14 garlic & herb chicken w/ olive oil & herb angel hair pasta for dinner, and my boys couldn’t be more stoked 
9775 2018-08-21 02:40:12 ん、これ油変えた？あーなるほど、ごま油をひまわり油で割ったのか。
9776 2018-08-21 02:40:03 Chips!!!!! Amazing & super easy. 300 degrees in oven and brushed w olive oil. Lots of salt
9777 2018-08-21 02:40:01 Bathed my whole body in coconut oil and citrus passion EO blend. Warding off whatever illness is trying to attack me.
9778 2018-08-21 02:39:57 as i met to get a macrame lamp from some FB seller, he told me i smelt like someone who’d buy this and asked what i wore. i replied with just oh, patchouli oil. he nodded and said he recognized the smell.  don’t know whether to be creeped out or happy i smell like a hippie!
9779 2018-08-21 02:39:43 Phone, gloss, lighter, headphones, essential oil lol
9780 2018-08-21 02:39:29 Don't use our Parks that the president didn't fully fund. To allow cattle grazing and clear cut trees. To mining and drilling for oil.
9781 2018-08-21 02:39:29 If Nicki wanna talk about the industry paying for someone's success, canola oil is the one.
9782 2018-08-21 02:39:13 I went to get an oil change and this mf tells me I need a whole new battery BITCH!! I wanna be 10 again,,,I can’t do this anymore,,,why did I wanna grow up??
9783 2018-08-21 02:39:04 IOTAが唱えるこの場合の「OIL」とは、モノとモノの間を摩擦を軽減させる「潤滑油」と言う意味合いでみても面白いですね。
9784 2018-08-21 02:39:00 Oil up the Wakizashi

9794 2018-08-21 02:38:16 canola oil won? the bitch hasn’t done anything since the beginning of the year
9795 2018-08-21 02:38:08 Seriously?  Mueller hands down.  But was America Really that bad Off.  With healthcare force feed and Muslim cozyingng that allowed Russia  , but we still have oil and climate change  and slave labor  . Everybody wants to be in business politics but no one wants to do any work.
9796 2018-08-21 02:38:06 man i love school. im kinda worried that i'll be a little lonely this semester but im taking an oil painting 2 class so at least I'll see some familiar faces in that class
9797 2018-08-21 02:38:05 Promise you that saudia Arabia could’ve easily gotten the same exact missile from China, yes it’s true we have a deal in which they supply us with oil & we supply them with munitions.
9798 2018-08-21 02:38:05 Canola oil can’t hold a candle to Ariana
9799 2018-08-21 02:38:00 i pit coconut oil on my eyes to take my mascara off bc my cousin did my makeup and my vision is blurry so yeah im Fucked
9800 2018-08-21 02:37:58 So I’m going to try to make a transition from smoking to using CBD oil
I’ll let you guys know how it goes 
9801 2018-08-21 02:37:52 @guarnaschelli How do you do a grilled cheese?  Oil/mayo/butter?  Grated/sliced cheese?  @altonbrown has mustard on his in the recipe I found.
9802 2018-08-21 02:37:50 Ew Canola Oil? #VMAs
9803 2018-08-21 02:37:46 how did canola oil- ok
9804 2018-08-21 02:37:17 Why did canola oil win
9805 2018-08-21 02:37:14 Any criticism of Oil's government is anti-national. The only thing they lag behind is mob-lynching.
9806 2018-08-21 02:37:14 Eso es de las Obras Públicas solamente. Falta Aduana, AFIP, Concesiones viales y de hidrología, minería, YPF, trenes chatarra, las 500.000 hectáreas de Lázaro Báez y sus más de 500 propiedades y miles de maquinarias, el juego de Cristóbal  López y Oil combustibles, etc.
9807 2018-08-21 02:37:11 LMAOO CANOLA OIL??? HOW
9808 2018-08-21 02:37:09 ExCUUSE me? Canola Oil? Really?
9809 2018-08-21 02:37:03 @ficci_india President: Fortunately Oil Prices Are Fairly Stable Now
9810 2018-08-21 02:37:01 Yall, the Maccabees lit their Menorah for 8 nights with 1 night's worth of oil.. Jesus fed 5,000 ppl with 5 loaves and 2 fish.. and now my shampoo bottle is going on 10 days of providing me with enough shampoo to wash my hair even though it should be empty. Call the Pope #miracle
9811 2018-08-21 02:36:57 Navigate at least 2 24 hour shifts successfully, get an oil change, and enjoy a few more pages of #TheDogsOfWar!
9812 2018-08-21 02:36:52 Triangles! Everywhere there’s triangles!  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil! The government could build hoverbuses if they wanted to, BUT THEY DON’T WANT TO!
9813 2018-08-21 02:36:52 I like to mix with olive oil and salt then put under the broiler until the edges are crispy.
9814 2018-08-21 02:36:44 The oil revenues are classed as Extra-regio. Hence, revenue is not accrued to any region or country like Scotland. GERS is a positively harmful propaganda tool devised by the UK Government.
9815 2018-08-21 02:36:18 want make ai xin bfast for mummy but end up the oil kena my eye zz
9816 2018-08-21 02:36:14 Yesssss exactly & Lucas oil has a roof!! 
9817 2018-08-21 02:36:07 All oil is bad for heart health
9818 2018-08-21 02:36:06 need to oil my scalp
9819 2018-08-21 02:36:02 This is because of their handling of their oil and failure on coming up with the value of a dollar. Socialism wasn't the fault. That's what a conservative would day but an economist would point to oil. Not advocating socialism, just calling this "fake news"

9836 2018-08-21 02:33:23 I am up there every summer for a week. Definitely up for a hike next time. And yeah, it’s interesting to think about what Titusville would have looked like 150 years ago, and crazy that the global oil business was spawned from those old rigs that still pump a few barrels a day

9894 2018-08-21 02:25:36 It’s more to do with oil & money. There are other Arab/Muslim states without both & they don’t get to sit at the same table. Agree about same blood thirsty history but that’s how the world is now. Kill or be killed. Or at least be strong enough to defend yourself & be ruthless

9901 2018-08-21 02:24:44 Right and it comes in this little container so you need so much of it  I got the “lactivist” stuff which is like an oil you put in water and it tastes disgusting and hasn’t changed my supply at all
9902 2018-08-21 02:24:25 Completely agree.  Heck, W wasn't even all that bad without Cheney.  Sure, he wanted to get richer with ill-gotten oil & dragged us into a needless war, but... He was at least nice about it and only lied & cheated a little bit.  He was worlds better than orange julius...
9903 2018-08-21 02:24:07 I agree! Actually I think cabbage, green beans & asparagus are equally good when cooked properly. I love asparagus baked in the oven with olive oil & coarse salt, add several splashes of balsamic then broil til a little crispy. So good!

9958 2018-08-21 02:15:39 Yeah morons, don't you know what happens when the US government gets its Saudi friends to artificially lower oil prices and you economy uses oil sales to fund programs for all its citizens. I mean capitalism works so much better they needed to be bailed out by taxpayers in 2008
9959 2018-08-21 02:15:39 I kept hurting myself today...I put my arm on hot pepper juice so it stung for like an hour, got splashed with hot oil (just a decent spot on my arm might blister), cut my hand on the stupid Saran Wrap teeth thing, stubbed my toe, and now my eyes hurt from day mode in the dark.
9960 2018-08-21 02:15:35 Turbines use oil.
9961 2018-08-21 02:15:29 @HempLifeGlobal Any info oh how Hemp CBD Oil can benefit people with Celiac disease
9962 2018-08-21 02:15:10 Venezuela Is not barred to sell anything to most of the planet.
But:
1)Only has oil to sell
2) Doesn't have dollars to buy.
Argentina could sell them anything, if they pay previous purchases.
At least 2 companies(milk and agmachinery) have gone bankrupt because they didn't pay
9963 2018-08-21 02:15:00 his failed gas/oil company cost taxpayers 20+ million
9964 2018-08-21 02:14:58 Hmm but potatoes are best when cut up and thrown in boiling oil, and the same would be true of Dutton.
9965 2018-08-21 02:14:40 @PhonePeSupport Does any Indian oil petrol pump in NCR accepts payment via Phonepe ?
9966 2018-08-21 02:14:39 She’s right tho. Toss it in garlic cloves, paprika, salt, pepper and olive oil and broil for like 5 minutes. It’s crispy and delicious. Doesn’t taste like lawn clippings at all.
9967 2018-08-21 02:14:31 This manager up at this store breath smell like motor oil
9968 2018-08-21 02:14:08 When I get married I’m not wearing a fucking suit and tie. You best believe I’m finna wear golden robes and have oil pored on my head during the vows.
9969 2018-08-21 02:13:55 @Uber will u pay for my oil change
9970 2018-08-21 02:13:47 @kraftcanada @KraftBrand 
For YEARS I've used  'just peanuts' PB & wished I could get some w/out the preservatives, hydrogenated oil, or icing sugar of regular PBs w/ just a little salt. I WAS SO V EXCITED for your "all natural sea salt". While I do LOVE IT touch heavy on salt.
9971 2018-08-21 02:13:33 bruh i been telling my dad i needed my oil changed for a MONTH now.
9972 2018-08-21 02:13:20 — his duty was. He eventually pulled back again, using one hand to finish prepping him as he wiped some of the soothing oil onto his hole. And he carefully stuck a finger in, lubricating him on the inside, before he finally hopped up onto the —
9973 2018-08-21 02:12:59 #1 get to know your hair, try different products to see what your hair likes and dislikes. Shea moisture’s Jamaican black castor oil line is bomb. Try deep conditioning at least once a month (bare minimum) and try staying away from heat!
9974 2018-08-21 02:12:57 @CBDHempBenefits Looking for feedback on how Hemp CBD Oil can help this with Celiac
9975 2018-08-21 02:12:52 Keep on the Borderlands can eat it. We tricked the cultists into letting us pass, dry gulched the giant  spider with oil & alchemist's fire, then when said cultists came to investigate, I cut open the charred thorax and screamed "Behold! The Heart of your God! Kneel!" #DnD
9976 2018-08-21 02:12:32 Jist of my oil change today:
“Yeah so do you remember the thing that broke on your car that took us 2 months and 2 grand to fix literally a year ago? Yeah it’s broke again”
9977 2018-08-21 02:12:30 Why does this oil burn from making turkey tacos hurt so much more than the time I put my hand down on a cherry red bolt with all my body weight that I had just torched off of someone's car?
9978 2018-08-21 02:12:11 Guy! Just stop these silly excuses.oil price has increased for about a year and half now, whatever happened to the recovered loot from politicians? TSA, Abacha loot, various loans couldn't build a single hospital?
9979 2018-08-21 02:12:11 Look like you about to change your oil wtf 
9980 2018-08-21 02:12:08 nope, him putting them in oil so they wouldn't smell proves he's lying.
9981 2018-08-21 02:12:07 Coconut oil is bomb
9982 2018-08-21 02:11:42 Sad to see that sister, we can relate here. The world's climate's is very messed up mainly coz' of fluorocarbons from coal and vehicles; and plastic that is a by-product of oil which clogs drainages. We must adopt faster an all electric vehicle world.

God bls
9983 2018-08-21 02:11:42 To any and all who hate dictators I implore you to boycott CITGO the Venezuelan oil company owned gas stations operating in AMERICA none of the revenue reaches the starving population.
9984 2018-08-21 02:11:40 if seems you have learned nothing venezuela is in this economic problem due to lack of investing in anything but oil whos prices fluctuate all the time. it is plain insanity to tie your currency to a product that is very unstable in value.
9985 2018-08-21 02:11:29 Nope, you spend billions to protect the resources.
Saddam Hussein? Was your friend against Iran, Iran whom you destroyed their chance of democracy when you overthrew Mossadegh to protect, you guessed it, the oil interests.
9986 2018-08-21 02:11:26 とりあえずクラスの人のFF全部切った
9987 2018-08-21 02:11:21 BWAhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha, ad nauseam...…………………..
Boy, are YOU easily deceived!  I've got some oil I'd like to sell you.  Have you ever heard the term "Christian in name only?"  True Christians don't make a habit of murdering for the fun of it.
9988 2018-08-21 02:11:16 Yes, Norway is very nice.  Perhaps you should stay there.
9989 2018-08-21 02:11:16 Mornings oil helps with bug bites. Also Benadryl or NyQuil. Knock yourself out. Or go for a walk
9990 2018-08-21 02:10:33 ウルフもハイエナも事情があるんだって
9991 2018-08-21 02:10:32 履かずに焼き肉
いいぞ俺も食いたい
9992 2018-08-21 02:10:30 So he lied & pretended to be a concerned husband & father.  He was having an affair and lied about that too.  If there was an ounce of truth to that, he wouldn’t have dumped those babies bodies in the oil tank.  So not only did he do it, but now he tries to tarnish the wife??
9993 2018-08-21 02:10:26 considering the oil, we should offer them statehood.
9994 2018-08-21 02:10:17 ぼくに言わせればワセリンすら食用だよ。
9995 2018-08-21 02:10:10 Right, he strangled his little girls and dumped their bodies in an oil well to decay for 4 days. Monster. I mean DAMN could you just bury them in a sweet quiet meadow with lavender white and pink flowers, or better yet, NOT KILL THEM AT ALL, YOU POS!! sorry, babies get to me...
9996 2018-08-21 02:10:06 Roast it with peppers, onions, yellow squash, mushrooms, grape tomatoes doused in garlic and olive oil.
9997 2018-08-21 02:09:56 今日は暑いなぁ

10000 2018-08-21 02:09:46 Bio oil tapi harus rutin
10001 2018-08-21 02:09:18 He planned their murders & getting rid of their bodies in oil tanks.  He wanted Shanann in the tank also,  shallow grave was a plan B.They were having martial probs, she gets preg to save it, he’s upset by it she goes way 6 wks, affair heats up,he looses it being stay at home dad
10002 2018-08-21 02:09:10 Oil derricks don’t have feelings
10003 2018-08-21 02:09:04 Olive oil is a sham
10004 2018-08-21 02:09:02 From freezer to baking pan, I added salt, pepper, chili powder, dried sage, a splash of lemon juice, and a few drizzles of avocado oil. Baked for 20 minutes at 400 F, checked them to ensure they didn't dry out, and baked for an additional 15ish minutes.
