4 2018-05-15 23:44:01 The notion of using blockchain technology for securities and commodities trading has been around for a while. Given the open-yet-reliable nature of blockchain systems, it isn’t surprising to hear that stock exchanges now
consider it as the next big leap forward.

36 2018-05-15 21:48:08 Ainda não vi um ciclo do Ibov sem Commodities. Se acreditar nos ciclos, tem que ter Commodities na carteira. É o que dá o start na economia do país. Depois teremos os outros movimentos em decorrência do que foi provocado pelas Commodities.
37 2018-05-15 21:44:23 There are no laws banning prediction markets  (except in certain circumstances when they violate, say, commodities laws, or a federal sports betting ban) however Dodd Frank gave the CFTC a broad mandate  to regulate PMs “within the public interest”, which is inane.

39 2018-05-15 21:40:00 Hirsch said he expects all assets - from real estate to metals, commodities, stocks, intellectual property, and brand equity - will be tokenized over the next decade in a way that lends greater liquidity to those markets through exchanges.

41 2018-05-15 21:34:00 We rely on #Immigration to keep the economy running, but that just makes the government see #Immigrants as commodities rather than people. When you look at the repeated failings of @ukhomeoffice there can be no question that UK needs #ImmigrationReform.

46 2018-05-15 21:06:10 Maybe you should visit some market how much is price of commodities in 2014 and how much is it now,inflation rate 9% before and double digit now
47 2018-05-15 21:04:35 Commodities Bullish Supercycle in play
48 2018-05-15 20:41:31 Oil is going up, but that just means we're going to have inflation. So, what's going to beat inflation? Bonds? Don't make me laugh. Equities are past peak and headed lower. Commodities or cryptos? My bet's on cryptos as faith in dollar sours.
49 2018-05-15 20:40:13 I am saying Buhari's admin gets no accolades even if inflation drops to 8.5% cos prices of commodities aren't falling.

Most Nigerians will remember that not NBS statistics

53 2018-05-15 20:28:19 Great piece! Hornbach's right! Inflation must rise to support higher yields, unless we see ↑ term premium - which could also lead to further steepening. Any views on this? Also, what matters most for inflation - oil, copper (commodities), wages/prices paid or something else?
54 2018-05-15 20:26:42 Where are the projects? On paper right. U just keep recycling the same budget every year and u keep increasing the prices of commodities in d budget. Na U be kwaruption
55 2018-05-15 20:24:07 Crude oil rises despite weaker commodities...
56 2018-05-15 20:20:55 Mas não é apenas a disponibilidade bruta de "alimento" que interfere no preço. Por exemplo o modelo adotado pelo mundo é o monocultor de commodities, isso faz o preço dessa monocultura em especifico baixar, mas afeta a disponibilidade dos demais alimentos fazendo aumentar o preço
57 2018-05-15 20:20:39 La economia crecio solo los primeros años de Nestor con los commodities por las nubes, soja particularmente. Despues se comio los superhavit gemelos CFK con sus politicas inclusivas dejandonos donde estamos hoy. La deuda no es mala ni buena depende para que la uses.
58 2018-05-15 20:13:17 Agora tem que ver se é o dólar que está se valorizando mesmo (o que tende a ser ruim para commodities), ou se o real está se desvalorizando (o que tende a ser bom para os exportadores nacionais de commodities), ou ambos (aí sabe-se lá o resultado líquido dos vetores).
59 2018-05-15 20:11:06 It is declared to be the policy of Congress, as a measure of national security, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation’s children and to encourage the domestic consumption of nutritious agricultural commodities and other food
60 2018-05-15 20:09:33 I might challenge semantics.  A large portion of the housing market is a commodity by necessity - it is built using commodities and they are what allow for lower cost of ownership and greater individual ownership.  A HOME, on the other hand, is what you MAKE of a House with love.
61 2018-05-15 20:07:49 Dear friends ! I recommend you #bitnautic  a trading platform for commodities where importers, exporters, and   producers of goods can trade their products all over the globe.
62 2018-05-15 19:58:30 Não faz sentido nenhum. Commodities são precificadas em dólar. Se o dólar se valoriza, commodities valem menos em dólar*.

* Tirando o efeito de choques pontuais de demanda ou oferta, a tendência de longo prazo é essa.
63 2018-05-15 19:55:20 You would think that if there were women on the board they'd invest all the money in dresses and shoes, which are very safe commodities.
64 2018-05-15 19:49:11 Vcs mandaram muito bem na aposta em commodities...

E os bancos são maravilhosos, vai?  Bancos!
65 2018-05-15 19:48:11 HSBC just announced they did the world’s first full commodities transaction solely on a blockchain.

They estimate they could save 44% time and 31% of costs by moving all trades to blockchain.

66 2018-05-15 19:47:09 Nice day for July Sugar-up 2.4%. Stay long and add on at 12.05 on a break-out on the charts. Soybean oil is not acting as well-but still in the profit. Cattle looking weak and expecting a further sell-off. Have stops for Coffee. #Agriculture #Commodities #farming #Cattle #Sugar
67 2018-05-15 19:42:27 Yes, I think you're right.Even so, it wasn't much fun to see a discussion in which women and their bodies were reduced to commodities, with their agency and consent considered an afterthought at best. I'm growing weary of gross "thought experiments."
68 2018-05-15 19:33:26 Bom....estão listando os caras que acertaram em commodities recentemente. Eu vou listar só um porque eu sou muito justo e sou testemunha da história>>>>> @rodrigoshz
69 2018-05-15 19:31:32 Bitcoin certainly better than "array" of commodities. But again you contradict yourself.  Bitcoin achieves it by mirroring Gold, being an intermediary replacement for energy (the primary input in all economic processes) with a near permanency, low cost of storage, and fungibility
70 2018-05-15 19:30:55 New course: The great social theorist Max Weber called capitalism the most fateful force in modern life. It is also an always changing force, and we'll follow it right up to the Age of Platforms that enable targeted ads to sell an ever more immense accumulation of commodities.
71 2018-05-15 19:29:20 Nash and any person who advocates a basket (or "array" lol another stupid mathematics term) of commodities can serve as "money" are bonafide fools who have never spent the time transporting, storing, or extracting a commodity. Pure theoreticians w/o interdisciplinary experience.

74 2018-05-15 19:23:06 The story is different when it comes to Oil, OGRA rules apply there. But when it comes to commodities like coal, gypsum and other commodities you can easily transfer at 80 tons. The other reason the freights of oil are very high but thats not the case in other commodities.
75 2018-05-15 19:18:42 The CIA factbook reports that #Liberia spent “$1.247 billion (2017 est.)” on imports of foreign goods, including rice and other commodities. FAO estimates that rice makes up about 80% of imports in Liberia. @GeorgeWeahOff , can we be hopeful of change in agriculture?
76 2018-05-15 19:18:28 Artificial price hike of the commodities must be strictly discouraged during Ramazan. Even these should be available at lower costs than the same in common days @ImranKhanPTI
77 2018-05-15 19:11:24 Most of us at 35 haven’t been given the opportunity to make what we should, have families, debt, raised prices of living and commodities by exponential never before seen.
78 2018-05-15 19:06:43 Individual commodities might respond to fashionable demand. But demand for food as calories produced from carbs, protien and fats is weak. Substitution of , , ,  may happen if the price of one is short. But aggregate demand is very weak.
79 2018-05-15 18:56:31 Perhaps I should start investing my money in commodities and/or other companies outside my own.
80 2018-05-15 18:54:27 Por mais que os sistemas tenham melhorado e integrado o mundo financeiro, o componente humano da politica é relevante na formação de expectativas de preços das ações, dólar, ouro, commodities etc.
81 2018-05-15 18:49:45 What products specifically? I would disagree, there seems to be increasing demand for some commodities
82 2018-05-15 18:49:40 The price of essential commodities are still at all time high. Many Nigerians are still hungry and suffering. Security situation worsens daily. We are tired of these rhetorics. We are concerned with how much a cup of rice, beans,garri, palm oil etc cost in the market.

87 2018-05-15 18:14:03 Ok for stocks or anything you can actually derive an intrinsic value, but for FX/Commodities/Rates they are pretty useful tools.

89 2018-05-15 17:59:03 "we often see ourselves as commodities to be used and not bodies to be lived in"
90 2018-05-15 17:55:04 This has been inevitable since the founding of CBP in 2003. The core hypothesis was that the border is a technical problem which can be solved by treating travelers as commodities, skilled labor as interchangeable, & adopting automation without fall-backs. This will not end well.
91 2018-05-15 17:53:12 There is no such thing as absolutes in any market environment. While rising interest rates will hurt some sectors there are other sectors that benefit greatly as evidenced by energy, commodities and financials.
92 2018-05-15 17:50:17 And he went everywhere unrecognized and lunched with Kansas City shopkeepers and merchants, calling himself a cattleman or a commodities investor, someone rich and leisured who had the common touch...
93 2018-05-15 17:40:17 Remove monopolies, especially vertical ones.  Don't allow someone control both the message and the transport.  The market and the commodities.
94 2018-05-15 17:38:02 I can give suggestions on what I would do! Always be forward thinking. For example, what commodities do we as humans require in the next 10-15 years? Water... always. Lithium (solar), cyber security, etc etc. small cap bio pharmaceutical is generally my fav :) best returns!
95 2018-05-15 17:33:31 You do not posses us, you have just shown your true colours, an infantile gammon faced fuckwit. Enjoy your brexit, when you have no commodities, NHS, pension or public services.
The blue passport, which you never had before as it was black, will make up for it.
Good bye.
96 2018-05-15 17:25:54 "When we crumble under the exorbitant weight of conspicuous commodities and the material pressure in a universe of illusion, life may become disheveled and devastated, while our mind has been dumbed down and our willpower crippled."
97 2018-05-15 17:05:46 You are  right in terms of implementing across all commodities, not just gold.Reason I chose Gold is coz the reserves are now located  deeper (and they are way more rich than previous deposits), unlike other commodities where its still open it, and some,at shallow depths
98 2018-05-15 17:04:38 It did back in 2008 & it will again. When the markets turn down credit lines disappear, shrinking the money supply & strengthening the dollar. All that money the Fed printed will go up in smoke bringing on deflationary recession. Gold & commodities will go down initially.
99 2018-05-15 17:01:47 You are thinking of consumable commodities.   This is not analogous.
100 2018-05-15 16:50:17 To ascertain whether or not this statistics are true,is to enter market. Don't sit in an air conditioned office and be tweeting things you're not sure of. Because price of commodities has not changed I am ordinary Nigerian I can it's changed a bit.
101 2018-05-15 16:49:59 Dear #Nigerians we are approaching a period where basic food items such as tomatoes,  onions and other agricultural commodities will increase in price as Muslims will begin fasting and the rise in diesel prices . Hope you've planned for the rainy days.

103 2018-05-15 16:43:36 Weaker commodities & EM historically go hand-in-hand with a stronger $. Now given the recent crowded short $ trade showing signs of turning, if the $ rallies strong enough to create sufficient pain, the Fed may hold back on rising rates. 3/
104 2018-05-15 16:35:29 With China's communist party 100th anniversary coming up in 2021, China needs to enter that year showing strong growth. To achieve this they prob need to allow the economy to slow now, which is -ve for commodities & EM in general. 2/

112 2018-05-15 16:14:09 Who else has noticed prices of commodities are dropping in the market, even in super and hyper markets  for instance, sure deodorant used to be 1,410 at SPAR i got it for 1,210 yesterday

Mr President are you aware that since November prices of basic commodities have continued increase monthly or weekly.Things are actually getting worse

119 2018-05-15 15:57:10 Retail therapy: Of course, the perversity of capital is that it makes you manic and depressed, and that one spark of happiness comes from purchasing commodities. That elusive spark that you seek to replicate again and again and again.
120 2018-05-15 15:52:14 Do not dismiss concerns for horse welfare with “ fringe” groups I.e. PETA. I have yet to hear of any horse competition that didn’t have cruelty involved where money and prestige is concerned. Ask any vet or farrier. They are commodities toward a different goal. Laws mean nothing
121 2018-05-15 15:52:08 Liekwise neoliberalism has a varierty of forms due to national difference in implementation. Overall there is a coalesence around less state intervention, belief in the rational of market allocation for all commodities, even the fictitious commodities of land/labour/capital
122 2018-05-15 15:47:34 Thanks so much defender of kenyans. Let's show those KP idiots Kenyans have brains not like them who posses the same ounce of brains like those commodities they sell in mogotio goat market or sugoi chicken market

126 2018-05-15 15:27:05 Way to go! Always detested the way women are paraded around like commodities at Cannes. Turning away women who refuse to follow their sexist dress code and discriminating against women film makers, highly sexist and regressive.
127 2018-05-15 15:21:46 I remember a $4.00 p/g spike in the price of gasoline,—produced by covert commodities speculation,—which caused Americans to lose their jobs, become homeless, dropout of school & struggle to keep their businesses afloat. Trump’s doing all that singlehandly.

131 2018-05-15 15:08:01 Yes, because women are commodities to be bought and sold to men (ever want to know why no one takes "red pill" seriously?
132 2018-05-15 15:05:34 Exactly, you need some external mechanism for food assistance that isn't fungible to other commodities. Even if we peg MW to inflation so that we never have to explicitly raise it again, that still won't deal with food security.  We have to do something else in addition to that.
133 2018-05-15 15:05:18 You consummate bunch of liars. Where are the stocks? Who was the custodian of the goods? Why did GrandpaChor JShah make tall claims about liquidating all commodities and paying back in 30 weeks.
134 2018-05-15 15:03:39 That inflation rate drops doesn't mean that prices are coming south, but rather prices of commodities are increasing but at a slower rate than the previous period

159 2018-05-15 13:25:24 There are some ultra-libertarians who would agree with that.

If it actually happened, the price of gold and silver and other commodities would skyrocket, and a lot of wealth would be suddenly shifted from one set of elites to another.

174 2018-05-15 12:05:16 Capital flight! Capitalism has less need to use for high streets for distributing commodities to consumers. The historical reasons for the location of many high streets remain: they are close to people's homes, easy to get to.
175 2018-05-15 12:03:01 This things has been explained before nah a decline inbinflation does not mean price of commodities is going down,it just means it is not on the increase as it were the month or quarter before

229 2018-05-15 05:40:37 То, что начал использовать Майкл Маркус прийдя на работу в Commodities Corporation в 1974г. - Очевидно, работает по сей день!!!
230 2018-05-15 05:20:15 With enough MONEY you don’t have to bother unlocking closed doors, you can just create new doors and pathways to the commodities.  ABUNDANCE for the masses will not create “Inflation.”
231 2018-05-15 05:14:19 Buying commodities in bulk increases demand and price too. Never buy in bulk and make the lower earning populace go hungry. #economics for the common man. #India #Pricing #Commodities
232 2018-05-15 05:00:02 Commodities: Lean Hogs -14.38%, Rubber -0.67%
233 2018-05-15 04:57:26 So after the intelligent minister left the prices of sim cards &wifi increased?.Saka ndiyezve akaita kuti shortages of basic commodities a disappear.
234 2018-05-15 04:44:11 You clearly don't know what the word intrinsic means. A dollar is just a piece of paper, Marek.    For the diversified portfolio of fiat, commodity, and crypto I hold I care about the goods and services I can get for it. That's generally how I value currencies and commodities.
235 2018-05-15 04:37:07 I knew worn women's panties were a fetish item but I was just informed sweaty bras, period panties and vials of menstrual blood are also hot commodities. Where do you even market/sell something like that? ETSY-kink?
236 2018-05-15 04:35:44 Sir, It it possible to commodities ban in future to Govt. opening new another option as Gold, Crude & Silver.....Etc.....Any indication....Need your Suggestions....
237 2018-05-15 04:21:57 That’s why GSW is the champs.

They know that that they know how to win.

Some may have Warriors fatigue, many root for new blood.

But proven commodities are hard to beat.

Look what it took for Denver/Philly to beat New England in recent years.

It’s harder in basketball.
238 2018-05-15 04:11:19 We empathize with the people of the US, treated as commodities under a fascist regime.
239 2018-05-15 04:06:58 I love medicine but hate the evolution of the health care industry. We do not provide commodities to customers. We give care to patients.
240 2018-05-15 04:04:10 I bought some BHP a few weeks ago and it’s up 10%, plus I get a 4.5% dividend yield. Not bad so far.  It’s doing a lot better than Telstra, CBA  and AMP!  #commodities at the start of the cycle, banks and Telstra at the end...

243 2018-05-15 03:53:11 Claro, ante la incapacidad de los puestos de bolsa por fomentar una verdadero mercado accionario y de commodities en el país, es más fácil recurrir a estos “retoques” en el texto original del proyecto de ley para asegurarle a la BNV su negocio.
244 2018-05-15 03:48:09 When people are seen as and treated like commodities to profit off, is it any wonder that many end up feeling like life's not worth living? - depression thoughts.
245 2018-05-15 03:38:44 The Russian economy is heavily dependent on gas, coal and oil exports. If only there’s a way for the prices of those commodities to skyrocket.
246 2018-05-15 03:33:56 In Communism there are also, exploited workers and rich elites living in walled cities will all the commodities and comforts of any rich upper class  cc @55Counties
247 2018-05-15 03:28:15 Devaluation have hiked Prices of Commodities higher to higher from 1947. Jai, Jai, Jai Shri Ram.
248 2018-05-15 03:19:24 @gr8tjude they own and control  the federal reserve which controls the interest rates  to the government thats why with their  ponzy sceam banking and control of the commodities market's they control everything they basically  own everything in america get rid of the banking
249 2018-05-15 03:06:49 @chedetofficial Tun, really don't want to over load you. However it's a wish from us to look into NAP, Bernas and free trade of all commodities so that price shall be more competitive
250 2018-05-15 02:58:38 Era posible con precios de commodities altos. Hoy en día lejos.
La posibilidad de que las industrias puedan descontar las inversiones en un 90% del IIGG sería una excelente medida.
251 2018-05-15 02:42:03 MERCADO DE BIENES BÁSICOS: En los commodities, el oro bajó 0.12% a ($1,319.10dpb); el Brent subió 0.72% ($77.84dpb), mientras que el WTI subió 0.50% ($71.05dpb).
252 2018-05-15 02:23:55 Sadly, I can tell you as an adoptive father of two wonderful children the word “market” is the right one. Both children & adopters are treated as commodities traded between adoption agencies & local authorities... although some are better than others... way better...
253 2018-05-15 02:16:09 But your damage was still not enough you pass the Commodities future monetization Act which deregulated derivatives and created credit default swaps which Warren Buffett called Financial weapons of mass destruction...cont 2
254 2018-05-15 02:16:08 A reação do mercado com o balanço do 1T está muito estranho!!!! CVCB3 e BB me decepcionaram. Dentro de minha carteira as únicas ações que vem surpreendendo e a VALE3 e LAME4. A primeira muito em virtude do rali das commodities e a segunda pelo resultado em geral do varejo.
255 2018-05-15 02:09:44 Need that multiplier effect on mine like commodities.
256 2018-05-15 02:02:47 Pensei que "commodities" tu tinha levado pra vida tbm hahahahahhaah
257 2018-05-15 01:57:09 Gustavo, esse gráfico considera quais commodities?
258 2018-05-15 01:48:58 Ni Macri es De la Rúa, ni los commodities valen mierda como otrora, ni debemos en relación al PBI como en 2001 ni las reservas son hoy 0 como por entonces.
Sin soslayar que en el mundo hoy nos apoyan y antes nos ninguneaban...
259 2018-05-15 01:41:10 Third party opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth
260 2018-05-15 01:26:35 *aula de economia internacional, 21h30 de uma segunda*
professor: boom das commodities
o que eu ouvi: bunda com modes
261 2018-05-15 01:14:13 Amazing how the people there enjoy life with such little commodities that we have.
262 2018-05-15 01:11:02 Pero son analfabetos, querido: con casi tres veces menos de deuda en relación al PBI, con reservas hoy en 55.000 millones y con los commodities al triple, NO HAY POSIBILIDAD DE UN 2001.
Deciles de mi parte que se hagan dar por popa
263 2018-05-15 01:08:51 .@funkhouserd, will you please explain commodities, labor, and rent to us?
264 2018-05-15 01:03:59 I’m really finding it quite despicable that health care for all, including the poor and disabled is a political pawn for Republicans and Democrats to bicker back and forth over. Peoples lives are NOT political commodities and should NEVER be allowed in the realm of politics.
265 2018-05-15 00:52:37 Western citizenships used to be prized commodities. Now they are given to even hate mongers and terrorists. Just another way our politicians destroy their forefathers leagcy. Stupid beyond words.

268 2018-05-15 00:32:05 New cars are commodities and every other consumer commodity in US has open pricing.  Agree financing has frictions, but mortgage rates are quotable and competitive, not sure why car financing is more complicated.
269 2018-05-15 00:31:47 Bdubs to watch the rockets beat the warriors . Might even yak about a few currencies and stocks even commodities.
270 2018-05-15 00:26:46 time & service quality are also commodities! got to be good & fast!
271 2018-05-15 00:22:21 En-Ron? That's a defunct energy & commodities company that was based out of Houston.
272 2018-05-15 00:21:52 I'm not talking about the Egyptian statement. I'm talking about human rights, which are being transformed into commodities that are used according to interests
273 2018-05-15 00:21:20 Agree on network potential. As generally agree on some (much more limited than hyped) potential for #blockchain applications. Disagree on commodities analogy, even more extremely: disagree on speculative instrumentation of commodities analogy.
274 2018-05-15 00:12:08 o Brasil voltou a ser mera colônia de explorações exportações de commodities produtos sem agregar valor e mercado interno foi esquecido
