1 2018-05-10 23:59:34 Trump is lying again .   Obama did not pay 1.8 billion for hostages.  However when Trump backed out of the Iran deal oil prices are going up and the ruble is going up in value.  It's Russia first and screw America for Trump.
2 2018-05-10 23:59:32 That's kinda lame. Municipal waste is one of the key producers of energy in Europe, not just in power plants but industrial boilers and cement kilns. Even and oil rich country like Norway depends on it for electrical production.
3 2018-05-10 23:59:08 Possibly because they decant grow much but oil and to import anything because embargoes we have put in place keep costs as such?
4 2018-05-10 23:58:55 Oil men put down offset wells to drain the oil from the adjacent property, too.

10 2018-05-10 23:58:29 I'm wondering if they can serve oil for dinner because soon, that's ALL they will have!
11 2018-05-10 23:58:21 This is not quite the same. After oil/commodities prices came sharply down, the Malay government imposed tax. It is the tax that brought incumbent down. In India GST simplifies the transport of good across India as it has one tax. Fo no worries.
12 2018-05-10 23:58:18 I love art. Oil paintings are dope. Graphite drawings are fire. Sculptures are beyond my capability. Surrealism and impressionism put me into another world.

14 2018-05-10 23:57:52 Oil sand companies actually clean the oil,sulphur , heavy metals out of the ground that is actually running into the Athabasca naturally... So ya... There's that
15 2018-05-10 23:57:25 Examine Trump investments. Has he formed a secret cartel w/ Putin? Is it foolish to believe the Trump/Russia "thing" is going to turn out to be something huge like a huge conspiracy for each to profit from enormous oil deposits trapped beneath Russia?
16 2018-05-10 23:57:25 The problem is their budget. The state has no money. The moron politicians evidently thought the oil money would last forever and now that it's not around, they are cutting budgets all over the place. Thus UND looking to renegotiate the terms of everything, including the REA deal
17 2018-05-10 23:57:20 Day after Trump backs out of the Iran deal oil prices rise and the ruble goes up in value. Russia first for Trump.
18 2018-05-10 23:57:12 You can't be serious. He's the reason for the gas prices. He exited Iran deal so his oil tycoons friends from Russia & China drilling on US soil can make billions quickly, driving up prices. Then,  he'll strike the same deal, take credit for it & Americans will have paid the tab
19 2018-05-10 23:57:01 Dream on. Potus needs to protect US interests. Oil is not one of them. Having a coordinated Mideast effort with our allies should be but trump has no foreign policy so not sure where that will end up. No more foreign wars.

yeah Kerry over this blowhard any day
41 2018-05-10 23:56:50 Iran is allies with Russia

Assad is one of Putin’s BFF 

Netanyahu is buddy buddy with Putin

And of course trump is #PutinsPuppet 

So why are they trying to start WW3?

45 2018-05-10 23:56:08 Her grandfather did give to charity before his death over half a billion dollars when money was money (pegged on gold) greatest oil man in the hydrocarbon era...
46 2018-05-10 23:56:02 LOL if that were mostly true, there would be a lot more liberals buying guns. I'm sure there are some people who do because they have a fear. That fear can also be reasonable. Every individual is different, and lack of fear isn't a Constitutional requirement for gun ownership.

48 2018-05-10 23:55:50 Why don’t you have a problem with the amount of coal being mined in Bc and shipped to Asia out of Van? No problem mining lithium? Have you seen a lithium mine? I find it funny how so called environmentalists turn a blind eye to these and only protest the evil Oil Sands! #puppets
49 2018-05-10 23:55:50 Very serious question. Which condiments does your household go through the quickest and why? Mine are soy paste, rice vinegar, and sesame oil, because we eat a lot of pot stickers and those make a great dipping sauce.
50 2018-05-10 23:55:41 Price of oil is the key to why the Iran Treaty was cancelled.
51 2018-05-10 23:55:38 もみぃ
52 2018-05-10 23:55:36 Suspicious! This “Russia thing” is partly about oil. That’s why Trump chose Tillerson. Trump wants to help Russian economy and Putin with better oil prices. Part of the quid-pro quo Trump has going with Russia/ Putin That is why Trump and EPA are against renewable energy.

54 2018-05-10 23:55:15 Dirty tar sand bitumen that needs power from Alberta's coal powered generators & lng condensate from fracking just to be extracted & diluted before it's even shipped & processed is many things but it's not oil & it's definitely not clean. #stopkm #StopKinderMorgan #TransMountain
55 2018-05-10 23:54:57 Beware when oil price goes up, cost of import goes up and fuel scarcity returns  to Nigeria. It is predictable

57 2018-05-10 23:54:18 Exactly  at least I changed my own oil and succeeded
58 2018-05-10 23:54:18 Price of Oil is the key.  Putin needs oil above $80/barrel for Russia's budget to work.
Trump cancelled the Iran deal because it will cause the price of oil to go up.
Oil up from $26 to $75 since Trump was elected.
59 2018-05-10 23:54:11 Absolutely. I, on the other hand, am fighting off the chronic sinus thing I keep getting from being on too many airplanes and just finished steaming my face with oregano oil and now have a paper mask on (because that fights colds, right?) I won't be sharing pictures.
60 2018-05-10 23:53:47 I don’t know much about weapons, but do a lot of #OSINT for tracking oil. I suggest you ask @EliotHiggins because he is extremely well versed in this field. You can follow his amazing research on @bellingcat

64 2018-05-10 23:53:26 You're pretty much as dumb as a pile of rocks president does not control the price of oil it has to do with the oil industry which our country does not control because we are not a communist country
65 2018-05-10 23:53:24 I got super cute just to go shopping and get my oil changed

71 2018-05-10 23:52:49 You can run light tight oil as FCC feed.  It would wreck your margins.  I think the point is that you wouldn’t want to be energy independent regarding gasoline, not that you couldn’t be.
72 2018-05-10 23:52:26 @James_Th3_Asian Sorry to hear that! Have you taken care of the oil change?
73 2018-05-10 23:52:23 Somalia was a nice country once - but then the West found oil. Now the indirect asymmetrical war on Somalia to break it and steal its energy reserves has taken its toll and ....it's not even over yet.
74 2018-05-10 23:52:07 they're probably the same people who praise/mock end of evangelion or david lynch films for being incomprehensible without bothering to think about subtext and anything that isn't just there on surface level

generally speaking, nerds & critical theory are like oil & water
75 2018-05-10 23:52:04 It's about oil. It was always about the oil. Niger has oil, that's why we were there. Why they kill Americans when they can. We are stealing their oil and they get nothing.
76 2018-05-10 23:52:01 Tillerson stayed in office long enough to get Exxon and his oil buddies Russian contracts.  They also planned ahead for "pulling out" of Iran deal to plump prices and profits of oil in the US.  Mission accomplished.
77 2018-05-10 23:51:59 @chigrl can I ask an presumably ignorant question. Start of 2016- oil was down at 25; and the whole narrative till mid 2017 was all the profitable shale taps come on at 50 (so oil above 50 struggles). what happened to that thinking ? - again v sorry if obvious
78 2018-05-10 23:51:58 I've been through this. I believe Peter thinks @Ripple are snake oil salesmen, knowingly shilling XRP to make money off people who don't know that it has no future.

84 2018-05-10 23:50:56 The democrats were all to happy to take our oil for years and keep our oil landlocked for their own greed, I take no lessons from any of them including Obama,
85 2018-05-10 23:50:56 What peaceful and effective resolutions has the US done in the Middle East? Are we really not going to talk about how the US has used Middle Eastern countries as proxy war centers to further special interested in oil and land?
86 2018-05-10 23:50:48 Guess who put tea tree oil all over her face and immediately regretted it
87 2018-05-10 23:50:13 what's that really good documentary that came out about a year ago about Syria, Iran, money oil and all that shit. The economy and pop culture. Any remember? It was free online somewhere and super good

93 2018-05-10 23:49:41 Then you have no clue.    It's clear.   You have no idea the lengths the energy industry goes through to provide oil and natural gas to the country.   The BP disaster was human error I admit.   But you have no clue as to the energy industry
94 2018-05-10 23:49:38 benzoyl peroxide, AHA or BHA are some good active ingredients to combat acne. Tea tree oil and Witch hazel are also some good ingredients!

107 2018-05-10 23:48:39 It’s a transition, it won’t happen over night but for the world to paint the Oil Sands as evil is just wrong. Look at the US and their environmental standards vs us, the Middle East doesn’t have any standards and Russia is worse then them!

125 2018-05-10 23:46:13 No, this was done because Obama did it badly. Everyone wants to deal with Iran because of cheaper oil.

135 2018-05-10 23:44:46 Who profits from the withdrawal?  The oil price has already surged up.
136 2018-05-10 23:44:45 Trump isn't even pretending there's an upside for America by leaving the deal. Re-imposing the sanctions raises oil prices & others destroy American businesses like Boeing. Trump is the only person I know who cheats at cards so he can lose.
137 2018-05-10 23:44:36 More oil is being produced now than ever before and it's going to continue to increase as better and more efficient means of oil extraction are found. You've participated in drinking the cool aid buddy, good luck you will need it.
138 2018-05-10 23:44:31 @algore Go fuck yourself and quit pissing on Alberta and Canada. Canada has the best technology when it goes to oil and gas. Go after fucking China or Saudi Arabia. At least Canada has human rights.
139 2018-05-10 23:43:53 Pour olive oil on a plate , sprinkle some black pepper in it and dip some French bread in it. If you bold try it with Parmesan cheese

Its an old story, no different than the oil for or food scandal.  All they care about is peddling their wares, ignorant of the prospect of doing business with those who will run the next Iran.

170 2018-05-10 23:40:57 It’s all about the deals. Trump doesn’t do anything unless there is money in it for him. Erik Prince and Kushner in on it. Weapons, nukes, war equipment, oil, whatever. #FollowTheMoney
171 2018-05-10 23:40:34 Highly paid, exceptionally dangerous work. Their heyday might come soon. Offshore oil/gas, routinely working in >3000 meters water. Beyond human limits. Guys really depending upon DECADES of decom work. Most facilities designed > 20 years old, gave no thought to disassembly.

COWARD
175 2018-05-10 23:40:28 As an Indigenous elder who trapped & hunted as a youth while GCOS & Syncrude were being built, I know exactly how it was then compared to now. The extraction is being done responsibly w/o harm. U are mistaken Al. You harm my people with your lies. Our Oilsands is just oil not tar
176 2018-05-10 23:40:28 Unintended consequences of 
1. sending them pallets of cash.
2. Seeing Israel bombed 
3. Britain and France are not allies
4. The USA is the #1 producer of oil, gas, coal and food.

I'll take a pass on the $40 oil, 95m ablebodied Americans out of labor force and low GDP.

186 2018-05-10 23:39:45 I’m curious as to how different is mustard oil from canola in terms of taste.
187 2018-05-10 23:39:45 There was no more oil in the house, nor were there any candles.（家にはもう油がなく、ろうそくもありませんでした。）
188 2018-05-10 23:39:41 taste like oil or soap?
189 2018-05-10 23:39:29 They rise every summer season and holiday season. It’s not just from backing out of Iran deal. Blame the oil giants

192 2018-05-10 23:38:45 I am very into feta-stuffed jarred olives (packed in oil) right now. The feta is creamy and delicious, the olives are well-cured, and it is overall an excellent jarred food experience.
193 2018-05-10 23:38:40 Dirty tar sand bitumen that needs power from Alberta's coal powered generators & lng condensate from fracking just to be extracted & diluted before it's even shipped & processed is many things but it's not oil & it's definitely not clean. #stopkm #StopKinderMorgan #TransMountain
194 2018-05-10 23:38:28 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows
195 2018-05-10 23:37:52 Can't you come up with something else, war for oil was so last decade.
196 2018-05-10 23:37:51 A tweet about how I showed up 25 min late to my oil change @ my dealership, pulled in the garage and got out with one flip flop on and one sneaker and was asked why I had one shoe on and looked like a flamingo 
197 2018-05-10 23:37:40 i feel like the oil meme going around
198 2018-05-10 23:37:35 I think the Alberta oil companies will disagree with your view.
199 2018-05-10 23:37:32 Really. Many scientists, not in the payroll of big oil disagree. Oil is going the way of the dinosaurs.
200 2018-05-10 23:37:32 What about coffee with coconut oil? or bulletproof coffee? Unless you don't do coconut oil or butter for some reasons?
201 2018-05-10 23:37:31 Fed’s not going to raise rates and conduct monetary policy because oil prices are volatile

203 2018-05-10 23:37:15 Ask loony Ollie when was the last time an anti-gun violence “civil terrorist” murdered 58 people attending a music concert. The combination of potassium nitrate and machine oil vapors seems to have an irreversible effect on the brain cells of crazies like this guy. Right Dana?
204 2018-05-10 23:37:12 I changed the oil in mine this week and felt like Superman.
205 2018-05-10 23:37:03 Charles is who I cut my teeth listening to almost 3 years ago. His recommendations about fish oil relieved years of pain and stiffness and allowed me to train harder than I ever would have been able to. Many thanks to @StrengthSensei !!!
206 2018-05-10 23:37:02 Coz they trade loads with Iran. They have a bartering relationship. Turkey, India, Pakistan import gas/oil etc from Iran but don’t pay in currency. Instead they export their junk at inflated prices. Economic sanctions would have significant impact on their trade.
207 2018-05-10 23:36:59 Trump is definitely gambling on this issue to come to an agreement like North Korea, but @BarackObama you have nothing to say about this, you gave many green lights to tear down the nations in middle east and for what?. You only made those oil companies rich. Shame
208 2018-05-10 23:36:53 Oil has gone up every year since I've been alive. How us that trumps fault?

216 2018-05-10 23:35:41 Thanks @JennaDeniseMoor. I have been wondering as much and cautious about Olive Oil in a deep-frying context.

Have been experimenting with Coconut Oil (which has a much higher smoke point/stability). Would love to hear any practical suggestions.

220 2018-05-10 23:35:09 I need to seriously go get a oil change tomorrow morning
221 2018-05-10 23:35:05 You should just switch ethanol to oil.  Oil is the one with permanent tax code provisions that eliminate profits to the tune of billions per year.
222 2018-05-10 23:35:05 I have combination skin. Biggest problem areas are my forehead and the sides of my face from my locs transferring oil onto it.

236 2018-05-10 23:33:41 Instead of shorting oil going into the weekend might be smart loading up on the military industrial complex index fund, e.g., Lockheed, Raytheon, General Dynamics, Boeing, etc.
237 2018-05-10 23:33:35 Maybe you need to do research on fracking and oil sands? Thoroughly! People in Alberta defend it re jobs....see down the road where it leads. Jann is entitled to her opinion. 
Perhaps you can ask a question of her, instead of berating her.

241 2018-05-10 23:32:52 Ding Ding Ding Ding we have a winner Alex!  The reason for backing out of the iranian deal?? Drive gas and oil prices up...Dismantle the EPA, approve pipelines on Native American lands....all for his fracking cronies who are probably russian business men..
242 2018-05-10 23:32:42 Does he have shares in Saudi Oil? Or take bribes?  Or just anti-women and supports regimes that are misogynistic?
243 2018-05-10 23:32:35 You understand Trump owns vast stocks in Phillips 66? And the Dakota oil pipeline than transports American crude? And he just pulled out of the Iran deal "because it was bad".  It artificially drove gas prices up and padded his pockets and interests. #hesgettingrich @POTUS
244 2018-05-10 23:32:32 Brisbane, we're being ripped off:

Terminal gate average for Brisbane today is 133c/L for unleaded, Shell less at 130.98.

Frustratingly, the rorting of motorists continues, no Bris petrol station below 135c/L.

No discounts from oil companies or retailers pocketing the discount?

250 2018-05-10 23:31:49 Environmental benefits of hemp McGill - USA, Europe, Canada, China could obtain most of their electricity needs, other energy needs fuel from hemp. Ford Model T ran on biofuel and petroleum.  Pollution from coal, oil increase health care costs by trillions of dollars over time.
251 2018-05-10 23:31:46 Also, Gore conveniently overlooks the fact that California’s oil is the dirtiest oil being extracted in Nort America.
252 2018-05-10 23:31:41 That is why oil prices spiked right after the US “exited” the deal and will continue to do so. Pretty sure we will have the most expensive gas  in years this summer.

269 2018-05-10 23:30:00 Agreed... many people even those claimed to be intellectual cud be easily duped into thinking the world eco disaster linked to palm oil using age old tactics... emotionally laden comments.. we had enough of these false "prophets" going around...

All the Tax cut effect will be gone by spending on Gasoline, You are making America truly great again !. Keep making those Saudi and ISIS terrorists rich!
272 2018-05-10 23:29:46 1. Pure Cranberry juice  2. Water  3. Hot Towel ( Now if you are have uneven skin tone problems ) Palmers moisturizing soap & skin complexion soap will help , but you have to be consistent. Also palmers has skin oil and it’s very good .
273 2018-05-10 23:29:37 People don't realize if oil goes up today it's a month from well to c store

Day 1
275 2018-05-10 23:29:31 Been getting a lot of my o3's from sardines in olive oil but just dawned on me that if they'd fake ev olive oil then they'd certainly fake sardines in olive oil , no?
276 2018-05-10 23:29:28 "Wag the dog".... with the added 'benefit' of higher #OIL prices.
277 2018-05-10 23:29:23 Got an oil change at the Dealership yesterday. Watched a salesman talk to a guy for at least an hour over a new Chevy truck coming out in November.
278 2018-05-10 23:29:18  I'll have to pass that question on to Will.
279 2018-05-10 23:29:16 "Wait, what do olives have to do with olive oil?" -@Smferraro22 #WereNotRelated
280 2018-05-10 23:29:15 Burt's Bees has a great roll-on oil that will zap that sucker... good luck!
281 2018-05-10 23:29:14 WTF is wrong with these people?  Do they not read?  Do your really buy this “100 years of ...” bullshit?  Do they not understand oil is fungible and a  market?  OMFG.
282 2018-05-10 23:29:10 3. The top 2 cost drivers of gas are world price of oil and taxes - allowing more oil from #AB & #SK into the world market and the prospect of future supply being available increases the supply and drives prices down... but do go on...
283 2018-05-10 23:29:08 Apply anointing oil .
284 2018-05-10 23:29:04 I have made the argument to people for years that the first and real environmentalists were outdoorsman.  They look at me like this Slate writer.
285 2018-05-10 23:28:26 I JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE MY MONEY ON STUFF I WANT TO BUY NOT MY PHONE PAYMENT AND AN OIL CHANGE fuck adulting
286 2018-05-10 23:28:24 #Russia oil making great profits since #Trump broke US contractual obligations under Iranian nuclear deal!  Once again the US is left behind & alienating our #NATO allies. Who said #Trump wasn’t #Putin’s bitch? @chrislhayes @jaketapper @donlemon @DavidCornDC @davidaxelrod
287 2018-05-10 23:28:00 "ConocoPhillips netted $26.18 per barrel of oil produced in Alaska-Alaska is projected to collect $3.90 per barrel"  @Ch2KTUU @ktva Our Fair share is supposed to be 1/3 #akleg FAIL
288 2018-05-10 23:27:39 Interesting numbers. Thanks  Wouldnt be that much more time to get % up. Total TOI would require Oil getting more PPs.
289 2018-05-10 23:27:36 I love robotic oil poffins~!
290 2018-05-10 23:27:29 It’s certainly a bigger crowd than the PM got when she went to Taranaki to tell them she was ending their oil and gas... My bad. She didn’t.
291 2018-05-10 23:27:12 Race results

292 2018-05-10 23:27:06 oh i knew he was he let oil companies dictate the agenda as OK AG they would email him and he would copy and paste the info and send it on
293 2018-05-10 23:26:55 College alumni form secret committees to raise funds to recruit husky young men, like lumberjacks, ranchhands & longshoremen, who can’t speak English right but can win football games
Professors let the huskies pass easy exams or risk losing their jobs.

294 2018-05-10 23:26:48 boo i promise you that my first act when i finally wrap my head arround rigging is to give you a 300k triangle oil can model
295 2018-05-10 23:26:44 やっぱりこの時間にガルパやってるのニートと大学生しかおらへんやんですやん
296 2018-05-10 23:26:32 Not so respectfully, not on your fucking nelly am I wanting there to be any getting on with brexit. I'd rather stick pins into my eyes, bathe in stinging nettles and gargle with car oil than get on with brexit. #thingsidrathergetonwiththanbrexit
297 2018-05-10 23:26:26 You know what it's time for the judge to put a gag order on Avenetti and Porni Daniels.  Those two are a total side show selling nothing but snake oil. Their constant 24/7 media parade is and web of lies is their attempt to harrass and intimitate the @POTUS.
298 2018-05-10 23:26:14 Black Coffee, Soda Crackers ( Skyflakes!), and CRAM! Burn the midnight oil.
299 2018-05-10 23:26:13 But not over night. It will happen but meanwhile, back to the issue, how to get Cdn oil to the world consumers. No debate on the internal combustion engine, bla bla... The market will phase them out naturally. Volvo going with a complete electric fleet in five years.
300 2018-05-10 23:26:06 I like Groupon.  I don't use it as much as some friends but I like it and use it. I never pay full price on an oil change or a massage.
301 2018-05-10 23:26:02 Lmaooooo Na una enjoy nau. Hall3. Plenty breeze. We wey dey inside Tunnel. Person go dey fry red oil around 1am. Say he wan arrange Egusi
302 2018-05-10 23:25:56 There is no such thing as ‘sustainable palm oil’. ALL palm oil destroys lives, non-human and human lives, as well as our planet!
303 2018-05-10 23:25:52 Trump is a simpleton with simple ideas.  Because he is incompetent and has only an infant's grasp of the Middle East, its cultures and its history (not to mention Putin's influence), he's going to alienate our allies and sew nothing but chaos = oil prices through the roof.
304 2018-05-10 23:25:38 @davesfreshpasta : the garlic bread tonight from the Davis Square store was soggy with oil and wasn’t even a baguette. Had to trash it. Wassup??? Am a long-time customer
305 2018-05-10 23:25:28 Forever flawless oil from @PinknessCo 
306 2018-05-10 23:25:28 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
307 2018-05-10 23:25:28 1st, TAR is a derivative of coal, not oil
2nd, Dirtiest oil in N.America is in California Placerita Field
3rd, Average temp of the earth has only risen 0.8k in 288 years - scientific term is "stable"
4th - I'll believe Nobel Laureates like Dr. Ivar Giaever, before you #hypocrite
308 2018-05-10 23:25:25 Oil of oregano is the truth!
309 2018-05-10 23:25:20 What we call 70 oil. Oil it traded in USD.
310 2018-05-10 23:25:19 I’t has to be the Chili bowl win with you jumping into Bryan Clauson’s arms for a winning hug from a good friend. If you love racing you know and miss Bryan

312 2018-05-10 23:25:02 Pregúntense pq Arabia Saudita firmó un acuerdo de armas con USA? Sus pozos petroleros se están secando!!  Adicional, desde el año pasado USA es el productor #1 en el mundo.  Todos los rigs que se habían alejado de sus costas están regresando, el plan de Trump? USA #1 in oil prod.
313 2018-05-10 23:25:02 Oil at my backyard, The joys of motherhood, Silas Manner ... purple Hibiscus 
314 2018-05-10 23:24:56 Just had oil delivered. 1970$ vs 1675$ three months ago.
315 2018-05-10 23:24:53 Don't trivialize an important issue with idealogical propaganda and no context please. 

CD Howe estimates $350 million of liability for companies with asset value below liabilities.  $8.6 billion includes solvent companies even at lower oil prices than now.
316 2018-05-10 23:24:41 Well all that matters is the net imports (and some sort of turning Alberta into US 51st state if Canada doing something funny with the oil export).
Mixing Tar Sands heavy sour and shale Light Sweet is a win win solution.
317 2018-05-10 23:24:21 Sooo the Saudis want oil at $100 a barrel, we're currently around $70 a barrel. Yet we keep hearing the US is to be the world's largest oil exporter...I guess we don't get any say in our own oil in our own country.
318 2018-05-10 23:24:16 援助（）してもらお！
319 2018-05-10 23:24:15 Yes!!!
320 2018-05-10 23:24:11 He always looks like he's posing for an oil painting to me. A historical caricature.
321 2018-05-10 23:24:10 What makes you think he isn't in favor of effective solutions to protect our children as opposed to the snake oil peddled by #gunsense?
322 2018-05-10 23:24:07 I had to check the oil in my car while my neighbor was chattin with my dad and he made fun of me?? Excuse me sir I can check my oil myself WITHOUT going to a mechanic every time the check engine light goes on unlike SOME people, BOB
323 2018-05-10 23:24:01 Any specific kind of bio oil? My face is always oily, so I’m not sure how it’ll work
324 2018-05-10 23:23:59 Not even mentioned the oil yet.....
325 2018-05-10 23:23:58 It would be a lot easier if everybody would just shut the fuck up and Destroy Syria and Iran so he could get rich off of his Genie oil Holdings.
326 2018-05-10 23:23:38 Wait a second, we don’t even buy much oil from the Iranians. Last I checked most of the oil we purchased is sourced here in the US. It’s the lack of drilling and low price per barrel in the past that’s causing the up swing you have no message Delete!
327 2018-05-10 23:23:32 Fair price shop(kollankinar) did not give packet of oil last month( April 2018) to my smart ration card in my village.
328 2018-05-10 23:23:29 Obsessed with this Cajun olive oil mayo from Green Soul
329 2018-05-10 23:23:21 Ralph Nader the Green Party candidate rcvd over 97,000 votes in Florida in the 2000 Election. Al Gore the most environmentally conscious major party candidate in history lost FL by 500 votes & an oil man became President. The Green Party “Helping Elect Republicans Since 2000”.
330 2018-05-10 23:23:10 Putin will get his rubles through Rosneft oil dollars  with increase of crude oil at the pumps . Putin is .
331 2018-05-10 23:23:00 "Mr Flinnie, it has come to this committee's attention that you had an affair with  *adjusts glasses* 'Naughty Derek's' mom!  Do you still have her number?"
332 2018-05-10 23:22:56 Not good to exaggerate if that’s the case, however , TMX is an absolute must do project which should rapidly be followed by more pipeline projects & an expanding LNG/oil export industry.  More schools, hospitals, businesses equals lotsa good jobs & increasing standard of living.
333 2018-05-10 23:22:51 Oil is not retailed in pounds you idiot. It is retailed in US dollars.
334 2018-05-10 23:22:48 Basic market forces. Price on oil rises the dollar feels inflationary pressures. It appears that they are both most stable around 55 to 60 each. Manipulation in the marketplace like shutting off and oil supply should do this. Was the last time this happened before a crash!
335 2018-05-10 23:22:42 And now Israel is close to all out war with Iran...good job!  It was that the plan all along, comrade? Russia loves those high oil prices.
336 2018-05-10 23:22:39 For fuck sakes, myself and everyone I work with in the oil sands didn’t even know @jannarden was even still alive. By protesting her you’re giving a washed up has been a voice and a platform. Her uneducated opinion didn’t matter until you reacted
337 2018-05-10 23:22:36 oil changes be coming fast asf.
338 2018-05-10 23:22:32 I have a place to get oil. What was your dosage like?
339 2018-05-10 23:22:29 You just lost my respect @algore. You did alot of good but now your motives are not for the good of the planet. I don't see you protesting increase oil drilling by any other country. If your motives were pure then it would to start clean oilsand programs not shut it down.
340 2018-05-10 23:22:24 He did it for the saudies ...to raise oil princes. Arabia is looking or a 88$ oil price to afford there budget operations.
341 2018-05-10 23:22:11 If you can tell me why just these negate the presidents ability to change the oil market, and there are many many more ways, I'll shut up wear a maga hat and stop reading academics and think tank reports forever.
342 2018-05-10 23:22:09 oiling my scalp down, and now I truly see why Michelle would ask me to oil hers. this feels amazing .
343 2018-05-10 23:22:00 Oil field defenders! Working as dogs for the elite! Protecting British petroleum! Lost a leg? Cry me a river!
344 2018-05-10 23:21:38 Are oil companies receiving some financial benefit from US withdrawing from Iran deal? I read that and do not know if true.
345 2018-05-10 23:21:27 Not in my backyard... until the price of transportation fuels reaches levels where those oranges/pineapples I import can’t be purchased at a cost that makes me profitable. Oh and those plastic bottles all my products are stored in... definitely not from oil.
346 2018-05-10 23:21:24 I braised them in a cast iron pan with avocado oil and minced garlic, and finished them with a little lemon juice.
347 2018-05-10 23:21:19 wow i had cannibis oil earlier and it was

349 2018-05-10 23:21:15 There are 29 empty crude oil tankers in those waters that have been waiting for up to a month or so; all as Venezuela's crude oil production has continued to drop.
350 2018-05-10 23:21:13 Castor oil heating pads  Help too . It will past away ..Bless you 
351 2018-05-10 23:21:12 Avocado oil RUINED MY FUCKING FACE OMG
352 2018-05-10 23:21:04 The Fritos have a nice oil to them that calms the stomach and the Dew stops the headache.
353 2018-05-10 23:21:00 Mark drove all the way to my tiny small town in northern Cali and changed the oil in my car and my mom’s car, 10/10 would recommend to a friend
354 2018-05-10 23:20:43 You know most of us do not work in oil and gas and we certainly do not work on pipelines. Move the hell on. Alberta isn't only about one resource.
355 2018-05-10 23:20:36 @TheEconomist  U Also Told Ur --Alarmists--What -SOLAR Panels & Wind turbines "won't" Provide that --OIL--Does --like --Fertilizer for Crops--PLASTICS--Even --Electric Cars & the  "6.000" PRODUCTS  the "World' Uses--EVERY DAY-Maybe "U'd"  List them so UR ALARMISTS could AVOID  em
356 2018-05-10 23:20:26 just brought my car in for an oil change and they’re cleaning it’s dirty ass ugh  see this is why i don’t change it myself lol
357 2018-05-10 23:20:07 I got coconut oil in my water too  skin feeling amazing Bitch
358 2018-05-10 23:20:06 I was DEADASS looking for my oil pen for 10 minutes and shit was in my hand the entire time wow I’m so done
359 2018-05-10 23:20:02 I asked for a prescription for the oil when I was diagnosed. Couldn’t get the weed clinic or my oncologist to say yes 
360 2018-05-10 23:19:58 Actually the oil coming from Alberta is cleaner than Californian oil, and with far better human rights standards than all of the OPEC
361 2018-05-10 23:19:55 That’s exactly what dropping the Iran deal is about, boosting Russia’s oil prices.
362 2018-05-10 23:19:54 Avocado oil for high heat frying; grape seed and safflower for sautéing and sesame for salad dressing combos.
363 2018-05-10 23:19:31 Maybe that’s what DJT/Bolton wanted a war between Israel and Iran ending in regime change and oil up for grabs #Israel
364 2018-05-10 23:19:25 Is the Vatican an oil producer? Asking for a friend.
365 2018-05-10 23:19:24 My coworker gave me this lavender something or other oil pill and every once in awhile I get a taste of lavender and I’m LOVING IT
366 2018-05-10 23:19:16 部屋とワイシャツとオイル
367 2018-05-10 23:19:00 Yes, block. After some research and help from Bill I believe they are using the money from Brian’s GFM to transport the CBD oil across state lines. So many signs point to this big time. Too much to type now.
368 2018-05-10 23:18:58 Why can't  the oil companies  use more American  oil and  build more  refineries
369 2018-05-10 23:18:57 Essential TV #RedApe showing the destruction of rainforests for palm oil and impending extinction of the beautiful orang-utan and Sumatran tigers, elephants and rhinoceros. Seek out palm oil free brands @ShopPalmOilFree Boycott those who continue to use it.

371 2018-05-10 23:18:29 I will have to hook up witcha,try some oil. Driving home now,can't text & drive. But I do have hands free in the new Grandcherokee.
372 2018-05-10 23:18:19 GOP is over one half Russian influenced in one form or another. We knew that from the insert of Manafort that the influence had reached the pinnacle, the President. Putin would find like minded(R) and funnel cash,property or stock. Like Gianforte $200m in oil stock in Russia
373 2018-05-10 23:18:13 You can't spell oligarch without oil.

#tytlive
374 2018-05-10 23:18:13 What a day. Got news of CBD oil certainty for hemp growers. Celebrated our state budget & legislative victories surrounding Alexander Field and @Sand_Valley as well as riverfront investments. We're getting positive things done for Central WI and we're just getting started..
375 2018-05-10 23:18:07 I'm glad you guys enjoyed me destroying any chance of a political career with that tweet
376 2018-05-10 23:17:53 Coconut oil > everything.
377 2018-05-10 23:17:52 When we started oil swaps with Mexico in 2015 so we could refine all the light barrel/NGL's coming out of the Eagle Ford that helps start the debate that lifted the export ban.
378 2018-05-10 23:17:44 Thank you Mr. President.  You will tank the economy with the high oil prices.
379 2018-05-10 23:17:30 というかそろそろ一年経つし記念の絵描きたいね…
380 2018-05-10 23:17:28 The last three times I've had my oil changed, it's been on close family members' birthdays, including the day my great nephew was born. Didn't plan it; just happened.
381 2018-05-10 23:17:26 Markets responding to Trump violating the Iran treaty. Oil prices moving up and will go much higher with Middle East instability to follow.  I'm locking in the #TrumpRecession hashtag, but feel free to use it or #TrumpInflation as shipping & perishable groceries prices increases.
382 2018-05-10 23:17:21 Not Israeli territory, time the apartheid state vacated and paid for the theft of water and oil it has stolen over the years!

385 2018-05-10 23:17:11 Hell, I've been using the case study of white tail in the US to argue for legal elephant and rhino hunting for YEARS now...
386 2018-05-10 23:17:08 Don't you get it? It doesn't matter when it started or where it started. It matters that it's going on now and that Donald Trump is the leader of this country. He can do something but does nothing except to allow oil drilling in virgin Alaskan territory.
387 2018-05-10 23:17:06 Hair has oil on it
388 2018-05-10 23:17:03 ぐだおくん描けなくなってたらどうしよう悲しくなってしまう
389 2018-05-10 23:17:01 sometimes it’s smelly oil
390 2018-05-10 23:16:57 誰やねんすぎて俺が針仕掛けそう
391 2018-05-10 23:16:55 How much do you know about oil dealings , are you a major stake holder ?
392 2018-05-10 23:16:54 What’s the upshot of this Tweet? That oil market is controlled? Commodity markets not regulated like stock market. No note of that in this less than newsy tweet. Another boogie boogie boo scare ya tweet from CNBC.
393 2018-05-10 23:16:42 To be fair, trump can't do much because oil is a world driven market. In 2015-16 about 81K oil & gas jobs were lost in Houston alone when oil prices dropped. That hurt badly. President Obama wasn't able to do anything about it.
394 2018-05-10 23:16:36 From the smell of Oil and Gas to the smell of Cows lol love it
395 2018-05-10 23:16:31 Went to San Francisco once. Saw two guys on the beach in speedos rubbing oil on each other. Maybe one of them was you??
396 2018-05-10 23:16:29 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
397 2018-05-10 23:16:18 Best gift you could ever give yourself.

399 2018-05-10 23:16:02 @nailogical has a video that she makes her own nail oil. And tbh I see results.
400 2018-05-10 23:15:57 Golan Heights is Syrian technically and in fact! Israel occupies the terrotory illegally and steals its water claiming to make the deserts green, and Geni energy stealing Syrian oil there too!
401 2018-05-10 23:15:55 REQUEST FOR A GRANT FROM SHELL
Shell makes monetary grants to nonprofit organizations within the U.S.  Priority consideration will be given to organizations in or near communities where Shell Oil Company or its affiliates in the United States have a major presence.

404 2018-05-10 23:15:39 Moisturizer with coco butter (I like the Palmer brand) or raw she’s butter, not that store bought shit. I use black castor oil in my hair to keep it healthy but I like shea moisture and Cantu products
405 2018-05-10 23:15:33 You know it’s hot when your coconut oil is melted in its jar 
406 2018-05-10 23:15:19 Gotta get them sweet palm oil #curves
407 2018-05-10 23:15:17 @KyleKulinski the overthrow of the Shah was alot more stupid then you think. The british wanted American aid to keep the oil British, but we said no then the British told us Iranian communists support the takeover and the prez (but he didnt like them) so we overthrew him for that
408 2018-05-10 23:15:17 It is refreshing to get some credible commentary on this topic. I gave up fighting this battle. Someone would tell me were oil independent and I would respond that we still import 5-7MM Bpd and I got blank stares.

410 2018-05-10 23:15:04 What US Oil Company are you working for Al Gore... we know you're working for someone.... The Jig Is up we're on to you
411 2018-05-10 23:15:01 I want to do some oil paintings cause they're so much easier to blend that acrylic but they can take weeks to dry and theres nowhere safe in my house to let them dry that long
412 2018-05-10 23:15:00 I was just thinking that this would be the best place to sell some snake oil...
413 2018-05-10 23:14:59 || I see. Well, at least it not bad as my last three days. Constant bad luck, I burnt my thumb, almost got oil pop to my eye, my essay got wet, my heart was hurting like hell and depression has finally took over me. . . Not a great feeling.

But I just keep smiling and being >>
414 2018-05-10 23:14:58 Since it's the big Oil companies that are predicting there's less than 50 years left of drillable oil, are they saying it because it's true or to increase oil prices?
415 2018-05-10 23:14:54 and is right across your bed  niceeee
416 2018-05-10 23:14:29 Would love a massage....with lots of oil.
417 2018-05-10 23:14:22 It's almost like firing one of the top, most respected, funny, well prepared, unique and identifiable play-by-play voices because the oil magnate Texans wouldn't invite you to their hunting party because they hear him making those New York City Seinfeld jokes was a mistake.
418 2018-05-10 23:14:19 i like seein people complain about taking antidepressants and showing a pic of like. fish oil pills or high blood pressure meds

420 2018-05-10 23:14:13 Newsflash: Rockefeller built his wealth from oil a couple generations ago and the new generations are divesting and putting their $ into more sustainable projects this is neither a secret/hard to find info nor is it a conspiracy you must be a @FairQuestions acolyte #muted
421 2018-05-10 23:14:09 Everything is aligned to take oil up. Around 73 may  be a good target...
422 2018-05-10 23:14:08 Snake oil, Fish oil and Hemp oil, all considered the best cures for inflammation

Inflammatory deseases..Cancer, Arthritus, Buldging disc, Fibromialgia, Lupus, Chronic pain..ect...

Oil is a concentrate

All concentrates are seen as TOXINS to the body

Toxins cause inflammation
423 2018-05-10 23:14:06 Virtue signaling, open borders Germany needs instruction badly. Iran exports oil & terrorism. It places zero value on human rights... Germany’s got trouble, and painting smiley faces on bollards isn’t hiding how greed under guise of virtue sold out the German people.
424 2018-05-10 23:13:57 I came for an oil change and they found hella things wrong with my car, about to throw the whole car away. Looks like it’s time for an upgrade
425 2018-05-10 23:13:56 Oh man I'm so sorry about your daughter. That sucks. I like his idea Jay!  As a child of the 70's when we sunbathed in baby oil and iodine (with skin that's practically see through and blisters like a flour tortilla hitting a hot skillet) I just know my day is coming soon.
426 2018-05-10 23:13:56 wait till they find out it's all game, not just ducks
427 2018-05-10 23:13:46 Me: “I’m gonna buy me something to treat myself since I’ve graduated.”

Car: “lmao, no. I need new windshield wipers, an oil change, tire rotation and an alignment.”
428 2018-05-10 23:13:43 Yes, they got a taste of oil money, and they will do anything to keep it (even allow oil companies to shield themselves from liability through independent contractors).
429 2018-05-10 23:13:34 I tried herbal essence and it worked. That was my first dry shampoo experience lol then I ran out and bought the suave Aragon oil one and the smell gave me a headache & made my scalp itchy. I’m now trying the dove volume & fullness one, it’s kind bleh.
430 2018-05-10 23:13:27 "The craziest and nastiest things in the world cannot be pursued or even ingested - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
431 2018-05-10 23:13:23 Gas has increased over .50 a gallon in the past 3 weeks.  This is due to oil increasing.  It and stock markets go up and down amid in huge swings daily.  Enjoy your short term but I prefer long term planning.
432 2018-05-10 23:13:17 All gone. No more oil. Our sweet crude runs nada. It is worthless to the European LibDem Scattish people.
433 2018-05-10 23:13:17 Not a squeak from msm about Genie Oil the Rothschild/Cheney/Murdoch enterprise which takes Syrian oil from Syria’s own #GolanHeights.
434 2018-05-10 23:13:09 coal shoe fetches its oil
435 2018-05-10 23:13:09 pure jojoba oil is the absolute best!! plus a bit of vitamin e oil is a life changer

441 2018-05-10 23:12:39 almost dropped my glass bottle of fresh face oil on my tile floor NOT TODAY SATAN
442 2018-05-10 23:12:39 The amount of oil to fill up my deep fryer .... what the heck
443 2018-05-10 23:12:16 Just put a Lush hot oil treatment in my hair, so if I’m bald tomorrow, that’s why.
444 2018-05-10 23:12:12 Friends of Science is a bunch of retired oil industry engineers and geologists. You've got a very clear agenda, which is to deny the validity of climate science.  And you hate it when anyone disagrees with you.

447 2018-05-10 23:12:01 "thanks trump" lets get the whole terrible world in a war, withdraw from every dang
one of the awful agreements, send our oil prices too the moon, destroy every friend we have, so if  some one jumps on us,it will be only us, and our naked ass!!
you the damdest dude I ever seen!
448 2018-05-10 23:11:59 I'm repeating myself as some of you know but you're just never going to win in North Dakota if you campaign there against fracking or oil pipelines. That's not how they think up there.
449 2018-05-10 23:11:57 I'll make you a bet. If there was plenty of liquid oil in the ground, there be no need for fracking.
450 2018-05-10 23:11:41 Spoke with an Elder from Coldwater briefly outside the NEB detailed route hearing in Merritt while on a break. He talked to me about why the community doesn't want the #TransMountain pipeline built along the aquifer. "You can't drink oil," he said. #KinderMorgan

454 2018-05-10 23:11:30 Stop saying supply and demand in different ways and pretending it's knowledge of economics.

The president controls the strategic reserve, permitting of the dept of interior, treasury sanctions with oil producing nations, and renewable standards, as a start.

Care to comment?
455 2018-05-10 23:11:30 can someone plug me with thc oil

457 2018-05-10 23:11:27 like saying snake oil sales people were good for health care 100's of yrs ago.  We don't need more shit coins. 95% of them don't need to exist.  #ETH is fundamentally and technically flawed not a platform that can be trusted.

461 2018-05-10 23:11:05 So Saudi Arabia drastically cutting production has nothing to do with rising oil prices?
462 2018-05-10 23:10:48 When we drain the last underground pool of oil. Try this experiment: take a glass of water, label it oil, take a straw & syphon the water out. When it's empty, there's no more water! Happens outdoors just like indoors!
463 2018-05-10 23:10:46 The ingredients are lemongrass essential oil, versions of potassium and sodium that are edible, citric acid, decyl glucoside (basically cornstarch), and water (not in that order). I also sprayed it in my mouth and didn't die,  I'm hoping for the best.
464 2018-05-10 23:10:35 My concern is that the Union Jack devalues the strawberries. Look what happened to Scottish oil when it had to remain British in 2014.
465 2018-05-10 23:10:20 I bought a oil diffuser and Logan is so amazed how cool it is lol
466 2018-05-10 23:10:20 #IranDeal #tRumpf exits agreement, oil prices rise. #Russia economy benefits. A planned deal between #Putin and his puppet?

468 2018-05-10 23:10:18 The Skripals could be in an oil drum at the bottom of the Thames for all we know.
469 2018-05-10 23:10:12 Many clients have stated this is a great combination! Cooking with infused coconut oil seems like a great option for patients!
470 2018-05-10 23:10:08 My sister tried to give me some coconut oil for my hair and I said no that’s ok my hair don’t really like that ... this girl gone say “I shoulda knew yo hair was boojee like you” ... 
471 2018-05-10 23:10:04 You already have tankers going by and through the west coast waters daily.  This is about trying to shut down oil production in Canada because that will fix the problem!
472 2018-05-10 23:09:51 We have some natural oil seeps hundreds if not a thousand years old but the environmentalists want them cleaned up immediately. Right, let's go clean up the La Brea tar pits at Federal expense. Ha!

476 2018-05-10 23:09:21 Louisiana's economy is tied to the oil and gas industry. Revenues are down and the state is required by state law to balance its budget.

479 2018-05-10 23:09:07 Well, with all this extra oil we’re going to have, at least we can afford to light solar panels ablaze at an affordable rate.
480 2018-05-10 23:09:05 I must look into neem oil and papaya seeds as contraceptives.
481 2018-05-10 23:08:56 Hahahaha bakit ube ba gusto mo??

484 2018-05-10 23:08:35 I wouldn't have worked for them in the 1st place. Heck I had a chance to marry into a Family that later became Billionaires from the Oil Business. My Conscience wouldn't allow me to do it. No Regrets.
485 2018-05-10 23:08:28 Left Marin County California for Louisiana 45 years ago when Equal Opportunity meant no job for a single white male. Drilled oil wells all over the globe & retired rich.

488 2018-05-10 23:07:55 Buy the bag and apply anointing oil
489 2018-05-10 23:07:47 That sort of language is enticing me to short oil.
490 2018-05-10 23:07:46 Americans will pay more for gas after Trump's Iran move sends oil prices up.  #Winning
491 2018-05-10 23:07:34 It’s not that simple, there’s plenty of reasons. That’s the gist of it. Price of oil dip if the supply rises but demand remains the same. If demand rises and supply stays the same, prices rise. Saying that the president is directly involved In the worlds consumption is a stretch

497 2018-05-10 23:06:30 Saudi probably more worried about oil prices now Iranian oil back on the market

#bbctw
498 2018-05-10 23:06:21 Trump pulling out of Iran deal, is a gift to Russia by raising oil prices. When will this collusion be stopped?
499 2018-05-10 23:06:20 Our oil contribution is small in scale. It’s like filling a pool with red Kool aid and then adding a gallon of water to try and dilute it to change the color. We just don’t have the supply to dramatically influence cost.
500 2018-05-10 23:06:08 @TheEconomist  Have U Told UR Readers--Who-Like U --Say FF cause GW/CC--that --OIL--"is" a FF--So...They SHOULD "Quit" using ANYTHING that is a PRODUCT "of"-or "is" -Made "Possible" by--OIL--like--Surgery--Anesthesia--or MOST  Medicines--even aspirin-or -- No MACHINERY  would RUN

506 2018-05-10 23:05:34 I imagined rather that US/Israel would rather bomb Iran's oil infra in order to put it out of commission as part of engineering an oil shock (and that only needs to last long enough to trigger a Chinese financial crisis)
507 2018-05-10 23:05:29 Remember those friends that put napkins on their pizza to get the oil off. Yea, they're probably in a psych asylum.
508 2018-05-10 23:05:27 Why crude oil?

517 2018-05-10 23:04:18 The only reason I haven't done something similar is that I can barely grow a facial hair, let alone many facial hairs that would necessitate beard oil.  How did it taste out of interest?
518 2018-05-10 23:04:18 Oil and gas companies are converting my friend. Shell is using minerals in #Alberta bitumen to create solar panels. Enbridge just announced they are partnering with the Canada Pension Plan to invest in #renewables to the tune of 1.75 billion. #cleanenergy
519 2018-05-10 23:04:13 I really do have to ask myself who the police work for Andy. 
The Tory Party, Rich landowners, Oil & Gas Companies or the people?
520 2018-05-10 23:04:09 ‘Harvard Kennedy School’ peppered though answers like a mantra. Dog-whistle for ‘neoliberal politics as usual’, supporting the oil industry. Yes, cyclists may be voters in his electorate, but follow the money.
Who donates to his campaign?
That’s where the contradictions come frm.

523 2018-05-10 23:03:49 Yep. $60/b and shale can continue.  Much less than that and US oil is FUBAR.  Expect something to happen to bring oil down to around this number and a little above it.
524 2018-05-10 23:03:47 oil prices are exploding and dollar inflation is steady over the past weeks...

530 2018-05-10 23:03:11 and if they did it would be a "game changer" and then they could sell the refined oil for Yuan and or gold!

531 2018-05-10 23:03:10 Putin has another great week (years) thanks to Trump.
Trump triggering oil +$70 will fund everything Putin wants to do against western interests.
American quislings.
532 2018-05-10 23:03:08 Oh my god you seriously think it's that simple. That's beautiful.

But you also think the presidency can't alter oil prices, which is also magnificent.

540 2018-05-10 23:02:21 Obama lifted sanctions on Iran’s oil supply in 16 and they produced significantly more oil. Now with Trump pulling out of the deal, expect prices to continue rising because Iran will pull their oil from the market.
541 2018-05-10 23:02:11 After a week of frustration I've successfully replaced an oil pan and a large chunk of my exhaust and it feels REAL DAMN GOOD TO HAVE DONE THAT.
542 2018-05-10 23:02:07 Listen Jewish people were as indigenous as the nomadic Jordanians.  They lived in peace for hundreds of years.  And it was a propaganda initiative on the side of the Arabs to rob them of their identity and give them an old Roman identity.  The whole thing started with oil
543 2018-05-10 23:01:27 This programme made me disgusted and depressed. I try to buy palm oil free products but it is difficult. It's all about money. Something needs to be done . Orang utans have the right to live.
544 2018-05-10 23:01:23 When the economy is doing well, consumerism rises correct? That leads to higher demand. Higher demand means higher prices. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to understand basic economics. Oil prices have been on the rise for the past year.
545 2018-05-10 23:01:13 The strategy is unrest enough so that Oil to china and India will still flow through Israel's pipeline
546 2018-05-10 23:01:09 I use it too during the summer but on my really dry days the rmca is awesome. Also, instead of regular moisturizer I use oils to hydrate. Lately grapeseed oil has been my best friend lol
547 2018-05-10 23:00:53 The FA cup is sponsored by Emirates, Man City's beautiful football is paid for by blood and oil. Most too clubs tour China. Can't do with double standards and the hypocrisy of lazy journalists who jump on the virtue signalling bandwagon #LUFC
548 2018-05-10 23:00:53 Why don’t you campaign to shut down American oil Al?
549 2018-05-10 23:00:53 Oil is traded globally is US dollars, & with our weak dollar, we pay more per barrel. Production cuts from OPEC & Russia. Saudi Arabia significantly decreased their production, also huge Increase in demand from China & India.

558 2018-05-10 22:59:36 The businessman that owns my oil change/inspection/tune up shop is helping me learn Arabic. I love hearing him speak the language and asked for his help. He willingly complied!!!
559 2018-05-10 22:59:34 Alan. I think it was Malcolm Fraser who committed Australia to fuel parity to prepare us for world price increases. We then had Bass Straight oil. It was all about excise then and no change now. The Government could resolve this with the stroke of a pen.
560 2018-05-10 22:59:15 Hey does oil work on grey hair and balding?
561 2018-05-10 22:59:11 Run oil prices below $40/Bbl and Russia would be in the economic hurt locker, but you are already well aware of that.
562 2018-05-10 22:59:09 While you're at it read their Modern Slavery statement. It's supposed to be prominent on the site. (I think palm oil policy isn't required)
563 2018-05-10 22:58:56 i use raw coconut oil but its like my hair eats it or something lol
564 2018-05-10 22:58:36 This is day 4 hair lmao but I used the ogx macadamia oil conditioner as a leave in
565 2018-05-10 22:58:36 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!

567 2018-05-10 22:58:18 Republicans like to help out big oil with high oil prices. They also like to help out other big donors with appropriate policies. Peons can use their small tax cuts towards much higher gas prices and health care costs.
568 2018-05-10 22:58:11 He did this for the real Pres. - Putin! Do help drive their oil prices up! And it will. QUID PRO QUO how do we wake up the ignorant supporters when their glued to one channel? Drop memory sticks by balloons like South Korea did with the North?? How do we break through?
569 2018-05-10 22:58:09 I bought some argon oil stuff last time because Hometown Shopko has a crappy selection and I was desperate. 10 yo complains that it smells like oranges. 
570 2018-05-10 22:57:58 i’m burning the midnight oil tonight on god
571 2018-05-10 22:56:43 Big oil greed !  Unintentionally motivating auto consumers next purchase, I love it! Buy a used electric w/  thermal battery management and you can't lose.
572 2018-05-10 22:56:29 Where can I get my oil changed that isn’t gunna cost me 100$ 
573 2018-05-10 22:56:15 Yeah so we can have their loved ones die fighting for Israel and Oil in the Middle East.
574 2018-05-10 22:56:06 Kevin-“where’s the olive oil?”

575 2018-05-10 22:55:51 And: "Fuel efficiency standards are a liberal plot to keep Amurucuns from their rightful Ford Mustangs and Dodge Chargers!"
Also: "The 55MPH speed limit us a thing of the past! We'll never get cut off from oil again! Bump it up to 75MPH and we'll just live with more fatalities!"
576 2018-05-10 22:55:34 Palm oil, rice, onions, stock cubes, pepper, pasta, crayfish, fish, garri, beans, plantain
577 2018-05-10 22:55:27 back done form what selling there oil not in dollars?
578 2018-05-10 22:55:20 Another Fake story by @cnn oil prices were already on the rise as expected didn't he approaching summer -As it almost always does
579 2018-05-10 22:55:18 I wasn’t critical of the article. I never realized most of that oil went to bio fuels
580 2018-05-10 22:55:13 Have you ever tried rubbing peppermint essential oil on your forehead and temples. As well as a little bit under your nose? I get extremely bad migraines to the point that I throw up sometimes and that helped me!
581 2018-05-10 22:55:08 What do you mix it with? Doesn’t it burn if you just put the straight oil?
582 2018-05-10 22:54:58 Right because I said it was all or nothing. And I clearly meant that all oil is bad. And that investing and researching new technologies will never fix anything. So yeah, woohoo, you win because oil is the only option we have and will ever have
583 2018-05-10 22:54:55 You should see the new vape pens they have out now with interchangeable oil cartridges. Amazing technology!
584 2018-05-10 22:54:52 Trump is against the Iran Deal because the oil and defense lobbies are against it.
585 2018-05-10 22:54:34 Frig you're awesome!
586 2018-05-10 22:54:20 Then they go triggered when they saw female WWE wrestlers.

They are only "starting to" because they want to exoand business relations since the price of oil fell in 2015.

588 2018-05-10 22:53:50 Inflation is being driven by the oil price more than BrExit. Expect it to start rising again soon. #BBCTW
589 2018-05-10 22:53:50 pool day 2. lathered in coconut oil,i’m determined to get my summer tan early lol
590 2018-05-10 22:53:45 SA have first world infrastructure, manufacturing and financial institutions that compete globally. Keep in mind they also have 24 hours power. Let oil prices drop and let’s see where we rank.
591 2018-05-10 22:53:34 Don't steal my bit
592 2018-05-10 22:53:29 Thank you! Unfortunately there is no such thing as ‘sustainable palm oil’. ALL palm oil destroys lives, non-human and human lives, as well as our planet  #NoToPalmOil #PalmOilAlarmCall
593 2018-05-10 22:53:02 @BahiCosmetics which one of your products are moisturizers? Also, I’d the SSS like a acid serum or an oil moisturizer?
594 2018-05-10 22:53:00 @realDonaldTrump Now that we are looking at potential peace with North Korea, can we look at helping the US economy by focusing on oil, rising gas prices and inflation on house hold staples? 40 cent gas hikes hurt the American workers
595 2018-05-10 22:52:57 Remember him saying that the US should have (illegally) kept Iraqi oil after withdrawing from Iraq and suggesting “maybe we’ll have another chance”. In order to do that he would have to launch a new military front and new world war. Some call me naive & overly suspicious. Oh well
596 2018-05-10 22:52:52 maybe, oil prices are rising to get us back to walking or riding a horse.
597 2018-05-10 22:52:50 ありがとうごさいます。
598 2018-05-10 22:52:48 Saud is nearly broke, the west's attack on oil (to hurt Russia, Venezuela, and Iran,)backfired. And Saud has been throwing bils into destroying Yemen. But the west still want them to start on Iran on the ground
599 2018-05-10 22:52:39 argan oil .
600 2018-05-10 22:52:37 Thinking this is the only driver of oil prices is so incredibly wrong. Why were they going down to $40 a barrel as the economy grew in 2015-2016 then?
601 2018-05-10 22:52:35 I admit I wasn’t familiar with the @IPAAaccess folks before @EnergyInDepth kept popping up in my TL. 

Now I know that they’re independent oil producers using social media to give themselves a bad name.
602 2018-05-10 22:52:25 Someone leaked hella car oil at the QT now that's all the hell I keep smelling
603 2018-05-10 22:51:57 I usually use sunscreen and coconut oil when I tan, I’ll be good! ;)
604 2018-05-10 22:51:54 The great selections of scents from deodorant to beard oil. Are you guys @badassbeardcare thinking of adding lotions to the mix or maybe solid cologne?
605 2018-05-10 22:51:52 And yes, I know already how we are all responsible for their decline with our over consumption of palm oil :-(
606 2018-05-10 22:51:44 My favorite @Rico_Abreu memory was when you won the @cbnationals and jumped in BC’s arms. #priceless
607 2018-05-10 22:51:32 Republicans and Trump promised Big Oil huge profits and they are delivering on that promise. Gas prices zooming and no one cares. Blame someone else is Trump politicizes
608 2018-05-10 22:51:29 I'm glad you plucked the unibrow
609 2018-05-10 22:51:27 ...why aren't we just putting oil on the wall?
610 2018-05-10 22:51:13 Al Gore’s net worth is $300 million 
Absolutely  zero from OIL 

SURE BIG SO.
611 2018-05-10 22:51:12 What lunatic recommends airline stock while the price of oil is surging. Stick with Cramer
612 2018-05-10 22:51:04 "All the Labour government is proposing with its oil and gas policy [ban new offshore exploration] is to shut down an export activity and invite businesses and households to import foreign fossil fuels rather than use New Zealand produced ones." Great point from @garethmorgannz
613 2018-05-10 22:51:00 Banks and oil companies. Collusion to price fix? Never. @LiberalQuebec @OptionConso
614 2018-05-10 22:50:48 I haven’t gotten my oil changed in 8,ooo miles, I like to live life on the edge
615 2018-05-10 22:50:36 Just like every GOP tax cut, most cuts DO NOT compensate for the inevitable rise in fuel cost. Straight to the oil companies from your check.
616 2018-05-10 22:50:33 Would the popular ‘Not a bot’meet your approval?Like I really care.

618 2018-05-10 22:50:31 You can thank Trump and Bolton for higher oil prices with their withdrawal from the Iran deal. You know who also benefits from high oil prices? Putin, Vladimir Putin.

620 2018-05-10 22:50:27 私がリュックじゃなかったから分かんないんだけど、学生のリュックって何でこんなでかいんだろう。部活とかしてたら自然とこうなるのかな
621 2018-05-10 22:50:22 I fucking hate this shit!!! I go to get an oil change, and when I'm signing my papers. I can hear the man who helped me tell another man, "I didn't change it, I filled it up"
622 2018-05-10 22:50:15 Whoever decided to give me the title “the diesel guy” at the shop can take that motherfucker back. I don’t like working on these oil gushing piles of shit...
623 2018-05-10 22:50:10 Winners are Putin - look at price of oil.
624 2018-05-10 22:50:09 when i was little i poured vegetable oil all over the floor and started mopping it cause i thought i was helping cleaning
625 2018-05-10 22:49:32 Beautiful photograph . It looks more like a vintage oil painting  .
626 2018-05-10 22:49:30 This began with you name-calling “wokes,” and claiming that any win for solar is a loss for “Big Oil.” 

That culture war might be worth fighting and winning, but it’s still a culture war.

When I expressed admiration/sympathy for that approach, you guys freaked out. 

¯\_(ツ)_/¯
627 2018-05-10 22:49:20 Ralph Nader's war on palm oil made popcorn unhealthy.  Now he wants to blame Democrats & let Jill Stein & himself off the hook.
628 2018-05-10 22:49:17 These people should get with the UN and create a country out of Syria, Iraq & Kuwait & call it SYRAK. UC Iraq pays a lot to get their OIL to market = SYRIA This is why Saddam attack Kuwait, to get a deep water port & is the reason Russia attack Afghanistan OIL = $$$$

632 2018-05-10 22:48:53 That’s great al, put down your cell phone that was transported and built with oil, and get off Twitter who’s servers are most likely powered by gas/oil.

634 2018-05-10 22:48:50 Head gaskets, ringlands, oil starvation. Pick your poison.
635 2018-05-10 22:48:44 If US s biggest producer & exporter of oil, y r gas prices going up over fear of less oil & higher prices over Iran deal? #EverybodyTalks
636 2018-05-10 22:48:37 The fries are so thin they taste more like oil than potatoes
637 2018-05-10 22:48:27 I’d let Chadwick Boseman use all my castor oil

643 2018-05-10 22:47:54 Patrick DeHaan @GasBuddyGuy, Head of Petroleum Analysis at GasBuddy joins us to discuss the correlation between Iran deal and rising oil price.
644 2018-05-10 22:47:49 Imma just put some coconut oil in my booty and call it a almond joy
645 2018-05-10 22:47:39 The fuel regulator failed and let too much gas into the rest of the engine which caused oil and antifreeze to seep into the rest of the engine and it blocked cooling tubes and stuff like that.
646 2018-05-10 22:47:32 Also in Texas. RA, FibroC ankylosing spondylitis, just to start with. I use cannabis daily and get clean when I need a new script. My rheumatologist highly praises cannabis. He recommends I ingest instead of smoke though. I do both. Making my own canna-coconut oil helps.
647 2018-05-10 22:47:32 A beautiful, tragic and thought-provoking documentary of undoubtedly the most charismatic animal on our planet. We must help our fellow orangutans that are now critically endangered - Palm oil should only be sustainably sourced any other variant should not be permitted to be sold
648 2018-05-10 22:47:28 LOL . Conversely Ms Ardern DROPS her OIL AND GAS bombshell from none other than but that bastion of working regionites - Victoria University. Enough hypocrisy puhleez
649 2018-05-10 22:47:26 I’ll admit to shedding the odd tear watching the documentary. Our household will be making an even greater effort to avoid anything with palm oil now. 
650 2018-05-10 22:47:18 What a load of crap. He's a consummate snake oil salesman.
651 2018-05-10 22:47:11 Crude oil (WTI) was at a 52 week high of 71.89 today. Let's see what it is in the coming days. That might be enough to set a spark and maybe has already.
652 2018-05-10 22:47:00 Hillside's most recent email newsletter with info about Spring rebates and incentives up to $500 to replace your oil equipment with new, high efficiency equipment.
653 2018-05-10 22:46:55 Was it hurt from licking oil
654 2018-05-10 22:46:54 I'm wrkn at firestone in hinsdale, sold house in downersgrove. Officially moved in with Sandy in orlandpark. Does oil help with aches and pains of getting OLD
655 2018-05-10 22:46:54 I am that person, soon as I find out you substituted oil for butter, or used some low fat so in such..I dont even want it. I dont eat cookies for low fat..non butter content..Give me all my damn heart attack Please
656 2018-05-10 22:46:50 And with the screening of my oil painted animation that is a wrap on my junior year at IC! #college
657 2018-05-10 22:46:42 That's the problem continuing with these projects keeps the oil industry popular restricting and slowing renawable growth and affordability. Stopping with these projects and moving forward with new and sustainable technologies is the proper way to go
658 2018-05-10 22:46:42 There is already oil discovered in Mexico. Just saying.
659 2018-05-10 22:46:16 Redyed my hair today, painted my toes for the first time in years. Just took the MOST relaxing bath evaaa. 2mg xan, green zebra, dabs, Avobath bathbomb, and You've Been Mangoed bath oil. Feel good, smell good. Did a full face treatment (besides the "man-made" one ). Happy. 
660 2018-05-10 22:46:14 Prosperity. I think not with rising healthcare premiums, oil prices, no infrastructure improvements........
661 2018-05-10 22:46:01 Oil and Real Estate are booming and I’m just blessed my family is enjoying it
662 2018-05-10 22:45:21 Thank you for the report! Only problem/question I have is all the demand for tapping into vast supplies of  U.S. oil resources, "Drill, Baby, Drill" to protect U.S.consumers from volatile global markets, U.S.would just produce and dump more oil into markets? Misled?

667 2018-05-10 22:44:50 I particularly loved the nuts toasted in the bit of oil. We had with a dollop of yoghurt on top. I can report it's delicious with a poached egg.
668 2018-05-10 22:44:45 Any detail. Umm. Obama believed higher gas prices/ oil prices would benefit the economy. He also mentioned how American civilians would need to be financially prepared for the increase. But he did not prepare them lol.

674 2018-05-10 22:43:49 Well, us are very rich, but after a litlle time  you will eat animals of zoo like Caracas.

680 2018-05-10 22:42:58 The only winners... the US weapons dealers and manufacturers. The oil industry as this could destabilize the middle East pushing up oil prices...

689 2018-05-10 22:42:06 #Trump is putting massive pressure on the mullahs.
Once the iranian population disposes of them, we'll get back to business as usual and cheaper oil.
Wait for it.

690 2018-05-10 22:41:50 Of course Saudi wants it gone. They are oil kings of the ME. Iranian oil would cut their market share. Every other civilized nation gets this.
691 2018-05-10 22:41:32 Pagan man, musk oil, kouros, oh the memories!!! 
692 2018-05-10 22:41:27 Yes, they are. By proxy. Putin, in exchange for much needed cash (via Iranian oil sales) supports the Iranian regime through technology exchange and exchange of manpower. The same regime is suppressing the Persians. Alawite Assad works as a proxy for the Iranian regime.
693 2018-05-10 22:41:24 Agreed these “oil peeps” are not looking to stoned off the ganja like you or me, and want nothing to do with the high that is the wax, that is the big difference.
694 2018-05-10 22:41:12 Germany, UK and France made a deal with the devil for the sake of cheap oil and a ready market. Why do you think Russia and China are in agreement with this deal? Iran will get the nuclear bomb under this joke of a deal and impose its will on you. Don’t ask us for help.

696 2018-05-10 22:40:59 Russian Republican common factors long before 2016: 
A) Oil - now $75. Russia wants>$100. War, proxy war, hot peace, one way or the other. 
B) Christianity - Franklin Graham & Patty Buchanan take Putin’s word he’s a Christian. What with all that “earl” he better be. 
C) Trump

700 2018-05-10 22:40:30 But oil prices and rubles went up, so there’s that
701 2018-05-10 22:40:27 @realDonaldTrump Time for a White House sit down with these greedy oil company's??? People have less money in their pockets after your wonderful tax break. Food is up, gas is up, electric is up, need I go on.

706 2018-05-10 22:39:47 Yes overall, granted some has to do with me having a great boss, my annual income will have a gain of nearly $15k. Between the tax break my boss received and the oil production being allowed to increase due to less regulations. I would shake Trumps hand with pride if I could.
707 2018-05-10 22:39:42 That’s SJR30, but I totally agree. SJR35 is a new safety net, taken from current oil/gas tax income. It’s placed into an account to be used for unspecified reasons, but the idea is to use it when we don’t make enough tax revenue. My ass gets itchy when spending isn’t specified.
708 2018-05-10 22:39:37 #MSNBC #THEBEAT  Can it get any more obvious? Everyone knows Trump is buddies with Putin and Netanyahu. And both of them are going to benefit from Trump turning on Syria. It's all about oil people. Time to put Trump in prison.

728 2018-05-10 22:37:15 Every $10 increase in the price of a barrel of oil equates to about a $0.25 a gallon hike at the pump.

It's $77 a barrel now, with many analysts saying it's soon headed to $100+.

Do the math.

730 2018-05-10 22:37:05 olive oil on my lips mmmmm
731 2018-05-10 22:36:42 I'm pretty sure this is silly.  A straw is 2 grams, maybe.  A gallon of oil (or gasoline) can make about 1700 straws.  Forget straws.  Drive less, insulate your house, get solar panels.
732 2018-05-10 22:36:23 or the argan oil
733 2018-05-10 22:36:21 So he's going to move to USA to be an oil lobbyist too?

735 2018-05-10 22:35:47 try the olive oil one
736 2018-05-10 22:35:34 When someone says “it smells good in here!” Not sure if it smells like weed or essential oil
737 2018-05-10 22:35:27 Try again. Oil. Onions. Mince. Spices. Canned tomatoes. Low heat, let em chill. Maybe add sugar to balance out any tomato tanginess.
738 2018-05-10 22:35:25 Merkel has to start cutting ties with Iran as they do 6 Bill in trade & they will be cut off & given more Tarriffs by @realDonaldTrump if they don't play ball & choose right side to be on.

745 2018-05-10 22:34:24 Al.  How about you worry about your own country and stop trying to further destroy our economy.  Canadian oil and gas is the most environmentally responsible of all the producers in the world and as oil and gas needs will NOT be decreasing anytime soon we need more Canada
746 2018-05-10 22:34:16 And by doing so has made a fortune for his oil investors.

752 2018-05-10 22:33:34 Dirty oil? What about oil from Saudi Arabia where they still hold public executions and treat women as second class citizens. That's dirty oil.

757 2018-05-10 22:32:27 Don’t buy products containing #PalmOil there is no such thing as ‘sustainable palm oil’ ALL Palm oil destroys lives, human and non human lives, as well as our planet!
758 2018-05-10 22:32:27 It’s crazy how much an oil change affects your car literally feels like I’m driving a different car now that it’s got new oil and a new oil filter
759 2018-05-10 22:32:24 OPEC glutted the oil market because they they were pissed that we were producing our own. The oil reserves are now diminishing. Not 2 smart

761 2018-05-10 22:32:15 @KeithMcCullough The oil deal’s demise will likely cause more oil flows to be paid for with currencies other than the dollar
762 2018-05-10 22:32:07 There is only one reasonable explanation for these high gasoline prices, pure greed on the part of the oil companies.

767 2018-05-10 22:31:39 I would say since we won't be getting oil from Iran anymore, Russia's oil reserves will be getting a higher price and a boost in there economy.
768 2018-05-10 22:31:33 Have done my duty - responded to Draft Revised NPPF consultation (deadline today). Not that they will pay much attention to anyone I suspect. Curious to know how Tory Government's policy supporting oil & gas fracking is (as draft NPPF says), 'supporting a low carbon economy'.
769 2018-05-10 22:31:25 there isn’t much of one, really! toss chickpeas in a little bit of oil, lime juice, salt, pepper & cumin, spread on a cookie sheet, & bake until they’re as crispy as you want them. i do this a lot w/different flavours- softer for adding to salads, crunchier for snacking
770 2018-05-10 22:31:10 Weird, you being such an informed environmentalist you think you would know this information! You don’t seem to care about the whales when the oil is from your own country!
771 2018-05-10 22:31:07 And people wonder why real environmental policies have such trouble getting traction. It screws up everything. 
But hey, at least our “dirty oil” stays being delivered in super safe rail cars lol. 
Mind boggling

773 2018-05-10 22:31:03 No, it will not. Iranian oil flow will be disrupted increasing the cost of crude. Russia must have high crude prices to sustain its government. It’s mass redistribution of our gas dollars through Russian crude profits funneled to Putin so he can mess with our elections. Sad.

776 2018-05-10 22:30:28 On RT the other day the host said that Trump's failure to uphold our end of the deal w/Iran will help them because oil is rising. Trump's chumps are going to pay more along with all of us.
777 2018-05-10 22:30:25 Its simple deal, Iran sell oil to China and payment in USDollars!?
778 2018-05-10 22:30:15 Please do not proceed with oil exploration, consider the effects encountered in NOrth America
779 2018-05-10 22:30:11 How Trump's withdrawal from the nuclear agreement with Iran is a bonanza for Russia:
1) The uncertainty leading up to withdrawal and after has increased the price of oil about 300%. Russia stands to gain trillions of dollars from the increase in price of oil.
780 2018-05-10 22:30:00 Nb @LidlUK @AldiUK @sainsburys @waitrose @MandSnews - Iceland are doing something radical about palm oil devastation - what are yous doing?
781 2018-05-10 22:30:00 Hi hadas. We were at the sbccsummit a few weeks ago in bali and met a great company rspo who are fighting hard to register producers of palm oil to help ensure sustainability. We met with them last week. There is hope. Check out their european summit in june.
782 2018-05-10 22:29:59 Or when you have to take your car to get an oil change and pay for it 
783 2018-05-10 22:29:52 It is dependence on oil variation and the dollar inflation
784 2018-05-10 22:29:45 Exactly! Oil is a vital economic organ of America, and this administration will have to chop off essential limbs of the country to save that organ if an oil crisis emerge.
785 2018-05-10 22:29:42 The world has the choice of trading with the US or trading with its adversaries. If China wants to buy oil from Iran, what's there to stop them? If they break US sanctions, as they do everyday when trading with Cuba despite the US embargo, at some point they'll pay the price.
786 2018-05-10 22:29:26 Hey @rainahhh have you been using a second, water based cleanser after using that cleansing balm? I was thinking about it and that balm has mineral oil as like second ingredient so that might be what's causing you to break out

788 2018-05-10 22:29:14 The short answer: because of the unregulated production of CBD oil, it remains possible for someone to test positive for THC from its use due to variations in quality control at the various manufacturers.

790 2018-05-10 22:28:54 @POTUS Every penny of the tax break you gave the American public is being stolen from them by greedy corporations and oil companies. Everyone is raising prices to try and get their piece of the pie. There is no other explanation for these high gasoline prices but pure greed.
791 2018-05-10 22:28:34 Oh and oil. Nothing like a big shiny wet butt and boobs and everything. Looks great and it’s even more fun irl. Like a slip n slide only waaaay better.

796 2018-05-10 22:27:49 No such thing as ‘sustainable Palm oil’ ALL Palm Oil destroys lives, non human and human lives, as well as our planet! If @IcelandFoods can do it then so can everyone!
797 2018-05-10 22:27:49 And if the Middle East goes up in flames and oil prices go up, it will be a massive wealth transfer from the American tax payer to one Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin.
798 2018-05-10 22:27:41 Indeed it does seem to be useful for appetite stimulation, with the benefit of not getting the user high.

At my work we get questions about CBD oil routinely (in relation to THC testing). Rarely do we get specifc info about why patients are using anything.

801 2018-05-10 22:27:20 because you people keep buying it & creating more demand!  boycott all palm oil products!!
802 2018-05-10 22:27:14 I bet he doesn’t mind that his countries oil is the primary benefactor in our oil staying throttled back to foreign markets. The disinformation campaign against the oil sands has been incredible
803 2018-05-10 22:27:13 So we just magically snap our fingers and everything is solar and wind power? Where do you think the money for those investments comes from? Oh and I would pay attention to your pension in BC you are heavily invested in Oil & Gas!
804 2018-05-10 22:27:07 Protect whose Pocketbooks? Who are you, Big oil? Why are you hiding from us?
805 2018-05-10 22:26:52 I know eneos is all about oil but why don’t they sink the same investment into something other than shale gas.  Become the biggest producer of hydrogen gas if they have to.  Generated from water and electricity, it’s clean.  Just need to ensure it’s safe
806 2018-05-10 22:26:44 Polina, in all seriousness, after ISIS oil, Afrin, occupation of Syria and Iraq, Cyprus- never mind Armenian genocide. What on earth does Turkey have to do for the EU to drop them? Its sickening

810 2018-05-10 22:26:34 1. If heating my home with oil or gas creates #GlobalClimateChange, why do governments grant monopolies to oil & gas companies, and stifle alternative inovation in the marketplace?
811 2018-05-10 22:26:33 Oh, is this kind of like how Tides Foundation gets funding from the Rockefellers? You know, the guys who wouldn't have amounted to much without the benefit of oil? Talk about #FakeNews
812 2018-05-10 22:26:24 I’m allergic to alcohol. CBD oil...
813 2018-05-10 22:26:18 When is someone going to start the Man Scouts?  Crucial man training, like fixing things, changing oil, and chopping firewood.

815 2018-05-10 22:26:11 u disrespectful asspipe. not one of your Demacraps  did anything but give KJU fuel oil while they were shooting ballistic rockets around... u haven't one reason for hating the President . I ,love the lib Tolerance  what have you accomplished  compared to Mr Trump, ZERO
816 2018-05-10 22:26:02 #RedApe What a harrowingly sad programme, but so glad there are the wonderful Animal Rescue Team to help take care of them. Do we really need all that palm oil? Devastating!
817 2018-05-10 22:25:56 When I put coconut oil in my hair and then wash it my hair smells, looks, and feels SOOOOO AMAZING and it makes the natural curl in my hair even curlier like WOW thank you @ jesus
818 2018-05-10 22:25:51 Is 2 true for all tight oil?
819 2018-05-10 22:25:47 I know...lost my butt in oil shares last year, so sold them...  Everything is suspect when u r dealing with CRIMINALS
820 2018-05-10 22:25:42 Man you are on a roll with your stupidity. First you say oil subsidies don’t come from taxes and now you question established science. Please promise not to breed.
821 2018-05-10 22:25:42 Why don't you give us the number, and we'll add it to this: The KM Trans Mtn pipeline would bring 595,000 barrels per day of dirty tar sands oil from Alberta to Vancouver BC. Shipped through the Salish Sea btwn WA+BC=700% increase in oil tanker traffic to 400 tankers every year.

823 2018-05-10 22:25:16 Just wait until oil fields become military targets and supply becomes restricted. Except from Russia, of course. Putin's bankers are smiling broadly at the prospect.
824 2018-05-10 22:25:14 My girl, you have to be Baptized in hot cooking oil.
825 2018-05-10 22:25:14 @Ronnie2K PSN is IAmFinkelstein. And I was wrong. This is officially day 4. Oil painting of you in exchange for a PD MJ. Can we make it happen?
826 2018-05-10 22:25:11 I am sure that Putin will make up for his oligarch's three private jets with the extra oil and gas revenue for Russia due to Trump sanctioning Iran.
827 2018-05-10 22:24:58 I just came for a oil change that’s it 
828 2018-05-10 22:24:57 Look to ancestral wisdom. Especially practices we abandoned.

Epsom salt bath. I know it sounds faggoty. Fucking do it. Mg deficiency sucks.

Cod Liver Oil.  High quality only. e.g. Green Pastures or Rosita

Go outside as naked as you dare for 30 minutes+ NO SUNSCREEN
829 2018-05-10 22:24:50 Shave with conditioner and use coconut oil thank me later
830 2018-05-10 22:24:47 Can’t have that anointing without the crushing! The oil can’t be made unless the olive goes through pressing!
831 2018-05-10 22:24:40 I don't know how much power buying them offers against the tyranny of Palm Oil, but it's worth a try...it's got to be worth a try! Did you see Red Ape: Saving the Orangutan on BBC2 this evening? (Assuming you're in the UK)?
832 2018-05-10 22:24:20 I got one like that. The pot clubs sells preloaded carts of oil for 40 a gram. When the cart is empty you throw it away. Makes getting stoned easy
833 2018-05-10 22:24:08 Why is it 100 dollars to get my oil changed 
834 2018-05-10 22:24:07 Mr. Gore I ask you to give me a list of ONE item in your life that isn’t reliant on crude oil. I’m waiting

838 2018-05-10 22:23:56 I wasn’t there
839 2018-05-10 22:23:41 It’s obvious @realDonaldTrump pulling out of the Iran Nuclear Deal was to raise oil prices to benefit Russia. Putin spent his money well.
840 2018-05-10 22:23:40 Big challenge to create sustainable palm oil production and use. @RSPOtweets has a huge role to potentially play in this.
841 2018-05-10 22:23:31 Osun no get crude oil na
842 2018-05-10 22:23:29 Don't listen to the fake news about gas prices going up because of the US getting out of the horrible Iran deal . We only get 3% of oil from Iran . Gas prices go up every summer . Vacation time always causes high gas prices . Really no reason for it . Just greed .
843 2018-05-10 22:23:23 Was there repping the oil seals and and O Ring industry but safely a few row back from the danger zone!
844 2018-05-10 22:23:19 Then ask them why Jared couldn’t keep peace in Middle East, knowing the plan ahead of this now war.   Europe keeping deal so they won’t intervene. Guess who will save the day? Russia! Then they get free pass for oil pipeline thru Iran & free pass for throwing election. Winning!
845 2018-05-10 22:23:17 Steve had an economics degree from Calgary, yet mismanaged the economy so badly that he eliminated a surplus, exploded the debt, and undermined the nation by pushing oil & gas over viable future industries. He was an ideologue and a corporate hack. Everyone hates Steve.
846 2018-05-10 22:23:07 So, you love Venezuela's and Saudi Arabia's oil but hate Canada. We hate you too.
847 2018-05-10 22:22:53 Did you know that in 2016 Remittances (money sent back by illegal immigrants in the US to Mexico) surpassed Oil revenues for Mexico, and became their largest source of foreign income?  Please tell us again how Mexico is actually "doing a lot to enforce immigration" #FactsAreFun

850 2018-05-10 22:22:50 Exactly! Russia needs cash & they get it from oil. As soon as there is a disruption in the oil supply crude goes up. The Iranian nuclear deal bluster is a sloppy wet kiss to Putin. Below $50-barrel Russia is hurting. That’s what Obama did to Putin. Trump is reversing it.

852 2018-05-10 22:22:29 Analysts have been talking for weeks about $80/barrel oil prices this summer. A number of factors contribute to make this a particularly steep rise. Most of those factors are trump-related.

854 2018-05-10 22:22:10 CBD oil comes in capsules, might be what ur looking for
855 2018-05-10 22:22:10 WHY is gas going up at the pump simply because OPEC is nervous about our pullout from the Iran “deal?” We were told we are the one of the most oil rich nations around and we don’t depend on Middle East oil anymore. It doesn’t make sense!

861 2018-05-10 22:21:24 Just one problem @realDonaldTrump , the gas prices are killing us and eating up all the tax cuts we got. Don’t get me wrong, but when we are spending our extra money on gas that is to damn expensive, it wipes out our gains.

Please force oil prices down.

864 2018-05-10 22:21:09 It's about war and collaboration. That's how this began. It was a message thread about WWII. You changed it. The Americans do very well out of policing the world to keep their oil costs down.
865 2018-05-10 22:21:01 The bottom line of this stats is that high price of crude oil is responsible for all this positive stats. But you can continue with your intellectual gymnastics sir.
866 2018-05-10 22:20:42 Try smoking olive oil. Makes amazing dressings.
867 2018-05-10 22:20:39 You got a picture of DB’s golf cart?
868 2018-05-10 22:20:31 Because Putin wanted oil prices up to sell his supply at higher $, so he told his stooge @realDonaldTrump to tank Iran deal to drive prices up.
869 2018-05-10 22:20:26 The tax on raw sales  from Decriminalising of #Cannabis alone would pay for everything twice over, then there's the biowaste we could use that instead of the woodchipped amazon #rainforest we are currently using, And oil for heating!

872 2018-05-10 22:19:44 Fine. Spend your money and invest in the renewables that will put oil and gas out of business. 

Shut up with the empty words and put up with the actual money.

875 2018-05-10 22:19:22 I can for sure see @Brittany_207 being the bully.
876 2018-05-10 22:19:13 I’m not so sure. He could have turned that around as relations with west improved. Add market reforms to that and a good supply of oil and gas. No... I think if he had been able to slowly reform Russia and control corruption he could have done it. We will never know of course.
877 2018-05-10 22:19:00 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
878 2018-05-10 22:18:57 #Iran says it will continue to abide by the #IranNuclearDeal even if the US unlawfully violates it, which the US did. The US has no more ground to impose or dictate any further terms for #Iran . If something happens, its becauae the US & #Israel are after oil.
879 2018-05-10 22:18:56 Do you use MCT oil?

889 2018-05-10 22:18:16 Well, I did it....got liquid soap made AND double batch of unscented castile and harvest ale castile.  Then I ran out of olive oil.  :D
890 2018-05-10 22:18:02 I'll make you a bet , I say that the production of oil will grow to levels that few can imagine unless some government gets in the way and stops it because of people like you. So you tell me when we will run out of oil and whoever is right wins $1,000.00 from the other.

898 2018-05-10 22:17:22 Decent demand at the 10- and 30-year auctions will ease concern that rising oil prices and increased supply will curb demand for U.S. government debt. Ten-year yields just can't seem to hold above 3%.

900 2018-05-10 22:17:06 It's such a coincidence that russia is benefiting from higher oil prices because the us violated the iran deal.

902 2018-05-10 22:16:41 The golan heights also have oil under them, hmmmm. I see a pattern.
903 2018-05-10 22:16:39 Omg someone put oil on the door it’s making that creaking noise and people keep going in and out of the room. My ears are bleeding 
904 2018-05-10 22:16:37 Nah, tRump just saved Russia, again, in by backing out of the Iran treaty. His buddy banks on oil when the mideast prices rise. That's a drop in the bucket to all the shit he's doing. He'll never do one thing to save anyone but his own sorry ass.
905 2018-05-10 22:16:31 USA and Israel occupying 1/3 of Syria at the moment. Israel has spent 14bn dollars and supported Isis in trying to destabilise Syrian leadership including.  It's all about taking oil and gas
906 2018-05-10 22:16:28 Psalms 55:21 The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.  Edomites/So White People, prophecy is being fulfilled everyday and judgement is on its way.
907 2018-05-10 22:16:24 Trump had more guts than May and entire EU. Notice how Iran slapped UK and Europe round the face by putting up oil prices
908 2018-05-10 22:15:53 Finally, I know that olive oil is not only for cooking oil or massage but also as a very good solvent for lotion that's lost of its consistency
909 2018-05-10 22:15:45 I think that Trump did this also to help Putin, he needs a better oil price but why is Israel happy about it?

3.. Aramco owns the largest refinery in US

922 2018-05-10 22:14:01 With this long driver tomorrow , let me just go change my oil lol ..
923 2018-05-10 22:13:56 People have been predicting that running out of oil was just a few years away since it was first discovered ,so what happened? The world is producing more and more oil every year ! If you have some kind of ability to predict the future tell me when will we run out of oil.
924 2018-05-10 22:13:55 @POTUS fight this stupid yearly rise in #gas prices.  Oil & gas profits just fine.  Price increases hit hard in rural America.  We don't have a choice about driving
925 2018-05-10 22:13:55 I want it in oil on canvas
926 2018-05-10 22:13:49 Here we go once again Big Oil fabricating excuses for raising gas prices - now they say its not due summer driving Here it bumping 3 smacker /gal
927 2018-05-10 22:13:37 The typical trend of the oil industry is to raise gas prices just before Memorial Day weekend keep them up through the summer and lower them right around Thanksgiving. At least that’s been my experience.
928 2018-05-10 22:13:17 @WTHRcom I have had at least 2 clients fail UDS due to CBD oil.  Folks that have not smoked weed but are now in trouble at work.
929 2018-05-10 22:13:16 I would leave out the toner every now and then. My sister did recommend a face wash (think it's a Korean product) that removes oil from my face. It did work but still got pores tho. Been having pores for a long time

933 2018-05-10 22:12:57 IMO slightly higher oil prices are good for the US as it makes more fracking profitable and improves US position as #1 producer in the world.  @cvpayne

939 2018-05-10 22:11:49 Yes, they are cooking with peanut oil and most fans have a peanut allergy.
940 2018-05-10 22:11:40 But it was a regional government that period. I desire someone to take me through history with facts showing me how oil money was used to build Lagos. I desire to know more.
941 2018-05-10 22:11:36 The oil is a hoax. Doesn’t work for me either my friend. It’s good ole real life ganja or wax for me. I pass on the oils all day every day.
942 2018-05-10 22:11:34 And yet zero protests are held in LA for NA dirtiest oil, zero protests held while Obama allowed thousands of miles of pipelines being built over his 8 years, and zero protests held in Vancouver for the coal exports, the largest in NA! Keep your BS south of boarder ass hat!!
943 2018-05-10 22:11:32 I’m afraid of razor bumps so I’m missing out on the quick grow :/. But ima cop some coconut oil!
944 2018-05-10 22:11:32 I work in the oil industry... your assumption is insanely stupid.
945 2018-05-10 22:11:19 There is no reason to use Palm oil. We do not use it in our products and we are plastic-free. They other great alternatives out there. Yes we want us out of the market every day! These are big guys like a mafia we have been fighting them for ages.
946 2018-05-10 22:11:03 Gas going up,guess what,drill in Gulf and stop buying foerign oil. We don't need them. Oil companies follow barrel of oil prices. Get use to it,buy a liter of gas in another country!!#
947 2018-05-10 22:10:50 Now that the oil prices have increased, we are watching.

949 2018-05-10 22:10:39 And how would you like him doing that to you if it was the other way around? When does it stop? Your military apparently has the know how to run a car on water, isn't it time we start saving lives and misery brought on by all these wars for oil?
950 2018-05-10 22:10:32 They said that baby oil sex different .
951 2018-05-10 22:10:14 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
952 2018-05-10 22:10:09 i love white people lmao the happiest i’ve seen my mom this week was when she was describing the new easy-pour cap on a bottle of olive oil she bought at the store
953 2018-05-10 22:10:07 バターとかマーガリンとか知らないけど多分吸ったぜ。
954 2018-05-10 22:10:05 Never tried that. Our hair LOVES moisture so you have to make sure you seal it. After washing my hair, I use coconut oil to seal in the moisture. 
The castor oil is amazing for your scalp. The jojoba and shea strengthens your hair and makes it healthy.

956 2018-05-10 22:09:50 Yes I have. The dolan Twins, kian n JC, tom Holland, Robert Downey jnr, Dylan O’Brien, Tyler posey, typewriter hoechin, Ian somerhaulder, Paul Wesley, joe sugg, oil White, Casper lee, I could really go on for days tbh
957 2018-05-10 22:09:41 - Very big ifs
- A symbolic gesture that literally only serves to piss off the rest of the ME?
- That I will concede, though it hasn't been solely the US
- and you mean with Saudi Arabia? Whose misdeeds we overlook because we like oil?
- and do they actually though
958 2018-05-10 22:09:39 Yeah I used to do oil painting, water colors, and pastels but stopped bc of supply cost and the mess. Now almost everything I do is in AI or PS. It just takes time and practice, I'm sure you'll get there.
959 2018-05-10 22:09:37 Make mine thin and crispy,  “fig, Gorgonzola and honey” or “Nduja with goats cheese and chilli oil” are the two I love to make in my little pizza oven. Mmmmmm!!
960 2018-05-10 22:09:36 Problem is US has to retool all their refineries..they are not tooled to process shale oil, they are tool for heaviers grades, this will cost upward of billions...most people don't understand global oil flows...
961 2018-05-10 22:09:35 Just followed you on facebook champ !  I noticed your headline pictures - note my cousin David got married in a Blue Angel plane - his best friend Hoss Pearson - Ex-Navy Captain and former Head team leader of the Blue Angels - we also do oil deals prior
962 2018-05-10 22:09:30 need a hot oil treatment like ASAP.
963 2018-05-10 22:09:23 You can start with socks on but take them off. Key is close up on toes and definitely the soles of the feet. Self toe sucking is awesome but you may not want to do that. As for putting something on the feet, saliva is my favorite over lotion or oil.
964 2018-05-10 22:09:09 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
965 2018-05-10 22:08:58 Narrative around higher oil prices seems to be perculating. Folks seem to want to believe in higher inflation and late cycle mkt dynamics, both of those things call for a higher oil exposure in portfolios
966 2018-05-10 22:08:58 Trump wants to buy oil from his best buddy Putin. He wants to help Putin make billions.
967 2018-05-10 22:08:41 WORST experience at an oil change to date! It’s like I was a walking billboard for Lies! Young woman with a crying baby! @midas charged me triple the price and double the time originally quoted! I will never be back! #rude #wrong #Midas
968 2018-05-10 22:08:40 It is the synthetic oil. Most likely Kush. Gives those of us that sell it and use it a bad look.
969 2018-05-10 22:08:35 TAC 4: The product is raw crude oil.
970 2018-05-10 22:08:31 おーありがとうございます！がんばります！
971 2018-05-10 22:08:17 If you cannot get at the lubrication system or filter directly, you may be able to lessen the effectiveness of oil by diluting it in storage.
972 2018-05-10 22:08:10 It's currently the oil wresting round.
973 2018-05-10 22:08:00 None of our achievements count cause of dirty oil money. Might be more of a fuss if we get 100 points this weekend. I've seen a lot of people on here downplay what we've done massively
974 2018-05-10 22:07:48 If the oil crisis happens, expect cuts in education & health.

It's the only place this administration can cut to keep the buying power once an oil crisis is started.

The teachers who work 4 jobs to make it WON'T make it. The hospitals short on doctors will be in trouble.#Resist
975 2018-05-10 22:07:41 I'm heartbroken after watching the #RedApe documentary! Does the world have no compassion for these beautiful animals? Don't buy palm oil!

980 2018-05-10 22:07:22 When boiling water and it starts foaming over, pour in some olive oil. Just a bit. It’ll make the overflowing go away.
981 2018-05-10 22:07:22 Direction of bonds/yield have a few catalysts. #DollarIndex & #Oil prices are very important factors. More importantly however, the 10yr t-note yield curve has risen higher than $SPX $DJI while pairing with the #stock #markets; needs to drop to provide breathing space to #bulls.

983 2018-05-10 22:07:12 Fixing the deal doesn't raise the price of oil.  Putin's budget is based on oil prices being high.

Coincidence?
984 2018-05-10 22:06:56 I have a good deal i can offer you a large export of oil from west Africa....we can talk privately for more detailed info
985 2018-05-10 22:06:41 oil prices
986 2018-05-10 22:06:28 You'd think Al Gore would be smart enough to realize landlocking the oilsands does nothing to curb worldwide consumption. All it means is more oil from unstable supplies from nations with poor human rights records and low environmental standards.

THAT...is an inconvenient truth.
987 2018-05-10 22:06:23 Higher gas prices are good for Russia and Saudia Arabia not to mention the oil industry here in the US. And I have no doubt Trump will tap the Strategic Oil Reserve if prices are too high before the mid-terms.
988 2018-05-10 22:06:23 Is it cbd oil? Or is it Kush oil?

990 2018-05-10 22:05:56 The UK has had a balance of trade problem for decades. Scotland's exports (especially oil and gas) have been a hugely important part of maintaining the export side of the UK's balance, while England has often been a big importer.
991 2018-05-10 22:05:51 I’ve gotten good deals on oil changes, car tinting, and escape rooms.
992 2018-05-10 22:05:51 Makes you wonder if Trumps "blind trust" (controlled by his children) and his assets - if he invested heavily in oil before pulling out of the deal. Hmmm. A Longshot or not?

1004 2018-05-10 22:04:24 At 14, made French fries for 8hrs a day in a food truck at the California State Fair. At the end of the shift I could scrape fry oil off my arms.
1005 2018-05-10 22:04:24 Two lessons from my parents:

1008 2018-05-10 22:04:12 I didn't know this either! Kind of conflicting, as a veggie. But t's very difficult to lead a 100% vegan lifestyle (where do you draw the line? Plastics made of oil, made of dinosaur bones?). Harm reduction is best.

I knew about the shampoos but was shocked at how hard it was to buy bread without palm oil,
Tried and failed to find a palm oil free chocolate biscuit in @LidlUK last week.
1014 2018-05-10 22:03:48 our government shouldnt exploit the military and use it for its actual purpose of defense rather than going to other countries and fighting wars rooted in money and oil. or fighting “terrorism” whilst simultaneously being a terrorist and killing innocent civilians
1015 2018-05-10 22:03:46 @SecretaryPerry Why are gas pricing rising when the United States per all reports in Energy Independent? Why does oil from other nations all of a sudden impact our pump prices. You need to explain to consumers why we continue to buy foreign oil?
1016 2018-05-10 22:03:44 Gore, Suzuki, Hudema, Horgan, Berman...etc.

The first indicator that all of these windbags have zero clue what they're talking about is the use of the term "tarsands".

There is no tar. It's oil.

1017 2018-05-10 22:03:39 Let's just stop using palm oil could it be that easy .I could live without it ?
1018 2018-05-10 22:03:37 What is old car oil used for? Like is it something that’s benefiting something else as recycling? Or is it just thrown away causing pollution?

1021 2018-05-10 22:03:22 Don't forget the hero of common law in int'l adjudication, Judge Read (CAN). His dissent in Anglo-Iranian Oil Co is legendary for its embeddedness in that culture—and, if I am not sorely mistaken, won him a posthumous snarky mention in Pellet's commentary on this point.
1022 2018-05-10 22:03:14 @realDonaldTrump I'm not quite sure there's a reason these oil companies need to jack up gas prices. Can you have a chat with them for us?
1023 2018-05-10 22:03:07 Why is American production gaining and you aren't fighting them? Oh right rockerfella brothers pay you and other activists to make our oil look and be bad so their oil will flow down their pipelines instead. Al Gore you are the biggest hipocrit their is or ever will be.

1046 2018-05-10 22:01:17 #1. Crude oil prices are up 18% YTD, from $60.42 for WTI to $71.23 today. There’s some seasonality to how oil trades, as we mentioned yesterday. But the sentiment on oil prices has done a 180-degree shift in 2018 on geopolitical concerns and Russia/OPEC production discipline.
1047 2018-05-10 22:01:14 I'd like assure you that we're committed to sourcing with integrity, it's 1 our core values. Our Sustainability Plan commits us sourcing our palm oil sustainably & ensuring own brand products don’t contribute to global deforestation. Kyrie

1051 2018-05-10 22:00:52 Nigeria produces 2.4million barrel of crude oil daily. Crude oil price per barrel is ~$75. Total inflow is $180,000,000 per day. It becomes $5,400,000,000/N1,647,000,000,000 in a month.

I doubt that the workers who are burning American flags in the Middle-East right now are going to give us oil.

1069 2018-05-10 21:59:39 Yes 90% of the time mine are dry to just prevent dust and particles from getting into the tubes. Then if oil is needed add a drop at the top and all set.
1070 2018-05-10 21:59:13 There is no reason to use Palm oil. We do not use it in our products and we are plastic-free. They other great alternatives out there.

1078 2018-05-10 21:58:15 I’m not sure if “vegetable oil “ is all manufacturers need to put on label, or if they have to specify palm oil. It’s in most soap, shampoo and cosmetics too.
1079 2018-05-10 21:58:13 @johnwschoen is trying to blame this on Trump. Oil is a global market and prices were already rising based on longer term fundamentals of future oil demand increasing and higher costs to extract oil. Oil has been too cheap (below cost to produce) and is  more balanced now.
1080 2018-05-10 21:58:11 in London we have a chain called Pak’s where i buy all my stuff from, they come in brown glass bottles. 

but i made an oil mix & recycled the original bottles so i can’t check the labels
1081 2018-05-10 21:58:07 China is positioned to be a chief beneficiary of the U.S. decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal as it would give China leverage to demand oil imports be priced in yuan, several currency experts said on Thursday.
1082 2018-05-10 21:58:03 At Eldora with my dad during 4 crown and you won a wingless race I think and when you climbed out of the car to celebrate and my dad said s&@t he's little.  Funniest moment and made him a Rico fan since!
1083 2018-05-10 21:57:59 Ustaaazz Yasjay
1084 2018-05-10 21:57:29 2. Sure there is. It means that is some section of Western capital (arms) is chomping at the bit to make war on say Russia, another has entanglements there (oil, gas) that make them a lot more restrained. Their loyalty is their coin,not to a flag.
1085 2018-05-10 21:57:28 We can’t help it NYC & CA jerk their citizens around with super high gas tax. Oil has been rising for weeks. My gas is still affordable in NC though.
1086 2018-05-10 21:57:26 China is positioned to be a chief beneficiary of the U.S. decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal as it would give China leverage to demand oil imports be priced in yuan, several currency experts said on Thursday.
1087 2018-05-10 21:57:24 Wait, is Saudi oil clean?
1088 2018-05-10 21:57:14 Heat oil in a pot/pan then carefully check with a breadcrumb if heated fully place the croquettes in the oil and fry until golden brown.
Remove from oil and cool on a cake rack or on some paper towel.

Enjoy ~!
1089 2018-05-10 21:57:04 Completely agree, there is no reason to use Palm oil. We do not use it in our products and we are plastic-free. They other great alternatives out there.
1090 2018-05-10 21:57:02 When u create political uncertainty , what do u expect... it’s worse due to the amount of oil pumped n the region. How’s that $1.50 per pay tax saving holding up?
1091 2018-05-10 21:56:58 Nob oil field baba.
1092 2018-05-10 21:56:51 #Newsnight Putin is playing everyone in this great game. A war between Israel and Iran would push the price of oil sky high, thus filling the coffers of Russia's treasury. Putin is a devil.
1093 2018-05-10 21:56:47 Well of course it’s lower! You end up dead if you sign up to the army and the marines! You also have an entire progressive liberal educated young movement that doesn’t buy into this conquering of the Middle East for our obsession with oil !
1094 2018-05-10 21:56:41 Me n my dawg Lou...boys was on that oil tough lol
1095 2018-05-10 21:56:34 I believe the appropriate response is “Fri-your head in hot oil!”
1096 2018-05-10 21:56:33 There's no  without 
The point is...
Post Civil war and "the booming 70s"
"Legacy Infrastructure" wasn't built in the parts that fund this nation   till date...

Port-Hacort port was built by the British
Long before Oil was discovered in "Oloibiri"
1097 2018-05-10 21:56:30 $100 says the oil in my car last longer than your relationship 
1098 2018-05-10 21:56:09 The USA is now a net oil exporter. And Trump approved the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines and opened ANWAR. We'll be OK. The only ones worried about gas prices are people that have to pay California gas taxes.
1099 2018-05-10 21:56:06 Mom and I walk up to her car and she was like "they scratched my car when they changed my oil." So we are both examining it..When all of a sudden we realized that we were at the wrong car.. And had been trying to get into the wrong car for nearly 2 minutes. We are so stupid.
1100 2018-05-10 21:56:01 That an oil vape? Those are fucking cool
1101 2018-05-10 21:55:34 Tearing up the Iran deal when the international atomic agency confirms Iran's compliance in enrichment. See the big picture. U s  Saudi and israel to take them out.  We want the oil fields back again

1105 2018-05-10 21:55:05 What did you expect? If more sanctions are applied by the US, who do you think would profit with Iran out of the picture? I'm sure Saudi  @crown_bin, Venezuela's @NicolasMaduro et al. are all enjoying the increase in oil and gas prices. And US, UK & Europeans pay through their...
1106 2018-05-10 21:54:55 And whilst I'm on a roll when will @thismorning do a feature on #PalmOil I've sent emails suggesting this to inform an unseemingly unaware (or not wanting to listen) public on what palm oil is and how they're shopping habits are pushing #orangutan to extinction. Inform & educate
1107 2018-05-10 21:54:51 As well so we'll the prices of everything else so congratulations on that trump so you just gave Russia all the oil and Iran. You sold America out again
1108 2018-05-10 21:54:39 Likely scenario is an oil crisis in 2019.

The midterms will tell us if it will keep going downhill or not.

If Trump wins midterm, high chances are there's an oil crisis of some kind. His ego is too big to fix his mistakes.

Best hope to fix it is Europe right now.

1109 2018-05-10 21:54:34 OMG peak oil! yes
1110 2018-05-10 21:54:23 The real question is why don't the indigenous people of Africa have there own share of the diamond business.oil etc etc
1111 2018-05-10 21:54:20 With Iran out the crude oil market, Russia (dependent on oil exports) will clean up on higher gas prices in our country. Also, our allies in Europe don’t trust us! Sounds like a win-win for Trump!
1112 2018-05-10 21:54:17 I remember some of those headlines myself and the whole peak oil theory.
1113 2018-05-10 21:54:13 Something to think about ..
Unintended consequences of Iran sanctions : 
1. Oil price rises
2. Iran and Russia make more money (remember US has sanctions of RU too)
3. US ally relationships are strained
4. US price of gas, plastics, electricity, food, etc rises
1114 2018-05-10 21:54:03 I watched too Felt immensely sad and yet inspired by the efforts of those saving the orangutans -Palm oil no more for me Though to be fair I have been checking and trying to avoid buying it#Boycotting needed!@redapes
1115 2018-05-10 21:53:49 Stop invading other people’s land, murdering and killing for the sake of oil.
1116 2018-05-10 21:53:46 Their not regional anything. They are a poor third world country that would have been outright starving if it didn't have oil. 

80 million Persians sitting on huge oil reserves are generating about the same GDP as 8 million Jews relying solely on their brains.
1117 2018-05-10 21:53:33 I think you thing Virgin olive oil comes from???
1118 2018-05-10 21:53:32 'Africa's at the start of a new colonialism; China's food, energy & metals demands need what the continent has; the flow back east is ramping up.  Oil from Sudan, fish from all coastlines metals from all principle deposits & commodities at baseline prices. China's giving chains'
1119 2018-05-10 21:53:27 This dinosaur will die, but someday turn into an oil trade 
1120 2018-05-10 21:53:26 I think it lots of Russian $$$ we just don’t know yet what America has given them back. I think this comes down to oil that Iran is now sitting on and the Russians wanr
1121 2018-05-10 21:53:20 @beautybakerie I tried my cake mix today and it kept separating when I put it on. What would you suggest to prevent this from happening ? I used the baking oil before hand and let it soak in for a few min, then I tried it again after I removed but the same outcome :/
1122 2018-05-10 21:53:08 Do not eat food or use cosmetics that contain palm oil. Those who are destroying rain forests for prophet are the ones who are annihilating our closest relative the orangutans
1123 2018-05-10 21:53:00 @McVities I love your biscuits (Jaffa cakes are my favs) but I haven’t eaten them for ages, because you use palm oil. Don’t say it’s sustainable, none is. Please swap? #RedApe #Greenpeace #orangutansos

1127 2018-05-10 21:52:00 Before you think about buying a diesel and not using it for it’s proper purpose. I pay $90 for fuel filters $100 for crankcase vent filter and $400 for oil and oil filters and that’s just regular maintenance as needed lol
1128 2018-05-10 21:51:56 @RachelNotley will spend $1.2 million on a billboard campaign to largely  target the Lower Mainland. She’s also moving forward on a bill that could restrict oil to BC.
Will BC tax all @Alberta freight? @jjhorgan any Alberta commercial vehicle gets extra highways improvement tax?
1129 2018-05-10 21:51:52 Nigeria GDP is misleading. They've grown barely grown per capita in 70 years. They only have a few decades of oil left.
1130 2018-05-10 21:51:49 i have almond oil, castor oil and jojoba oil in my daily mix. plus coconut but that’s mostly for curls and smell, not moisture.
1131 2018-05-10 21:51:41 and as for the fakery allegetions-its possible if you consider -mannequin challenge clip-shows they could be faking them,syria campaign (mentioned in article) headed by asfari -syrian oil baron and funder of chatham house -his wife is a film producer-
1132 2018-05-10 21:51:39 They're just a bunch of arms salesmen doing business with oil industry and this is always their hope and kids' future even when it's not it's what they prEy for

1134 2018-05-10 21:51:16 Quebec is in the process of building a pipeline, BC is as well. If you don’t like pipeline you should be begging Rachel to shut off the oil in the existing pipeline.
1135 2018-05-10 21:51:12 sameeee I miss being a mechanic :(( I acc miss my cars, the oil changes, the bulb fits and gear boxes fml
1136 2018-05-10 21:51:04 Accidentally put in the oil reservoir. Haven’t run it yet. Just gonna top it off with some 30w and a fresh tank of gas.
1137 2018-05-10 21:50:47 attack IRAN bases,in SYRIA to provoke IRAN into an all out WAR, its,a fact SAUDI ARABIA will use this to attempt to topple the IRAN leadership  and then attempt to control IRAN'S oil and paying ISRAEL with free GAS and OIL for them helping SAUDI ARABIA to topple IRAN'S government
1138 2018-05-10 21:50:42 Yep....in 2016 when sanctions against Iran were lifted they upped oil production....with the idiot in the WH....they will probably significantly reduce production sending our prices for gas thru the roof....

1142 2018-05-10 21:49:49 I don't understand this level of horrible behavior. I would rather live in a dumpster than preach his rhetoric. How's his "weight loss" shakes workin out. Maybe someone can sneak some lithium into them. Then at least they'd do something. He literally sells snake oil 
1143 2018-05-10 21:49:40 I can’t believe I’ve still got feet unscarred by trays of roast potatoes after all these years.. booze, steam , boiling oil covered veg!! Genius or just lucky ?
1144 2018-05-10 21:49:34 ↓they look photos but actually they are oil painting. Wow
1145 2018-05-10 21:49:34 In the oil hole or with the fuel?  If in the oil hole, depends on how long you ran it; that shit is pretty thin. If in fuel hole and it was just mix gas, it’ll probably just be smoky for awhile.
1146 2018-05-10 21:49:33 You must always say thank you to purple who bring sub side to your life.
Whether they know that have that effect on you, or they're just magical like that. 
Don't let your Sun Shine go away.
"Thank you" is the Oil.
1147 2018-05-10 21:49:25 Yes! Has she succumbed to the Heppel oil since implanting it causes the life expectancy to be shorter than normal? Did Scorpy live happily ever after? We need to know.

1148 2018-05-10 21:49:22 That's why I Donald Trump and Putin are backing Israel they calculated this film way back I hope the other world leaders tell Donald Trump to stay out of it since he pulled out of the agreement they're planning to take control of Iran's resources and oil
1149 2018-05-10 21:49:21 @AndyTCarroll oil you gobby coward think it's OK to punch people do u prick
1150 2018-05-10 21:49:19 @CortesSteve Hey twerpo, look like oil prices will go up as a result of he Iran deal faltering and will help Putin make billions. Looks like they spent their rubles well you dimwit.
1151 2018-05-10 21:49:15 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
1152 2018-05-10 21:49:11 I think I may have not diluted my foundation enough. It feels a bit itchy and hot on the skin. The body oil is more far diluted and I don't have that same reaction to it. Then again it might be reacting to the primer or powder I put on before it.
1153 2018-05-10 21:49:11 cute bathing suit, tanning oil, and jams is my mood right now
1154 2018-05-10 21:49:10 That "DIRTY TAR SANDS OIL" just powered the plane to get you here & there & every where  - mind your own knitting - we have enough spineless wonders to deal with already - and you're all HYPOCRITES.
1155 2018-05-10 21:49:08 Not unless oil comes down
1156 2018-05-10 21:48:57 Who tf buys oil by the barrel?
1157 2018-05-10 21:48:51 Wonderful! Paper prices have already risen as a result of tariffs on Canada. Health insurance rates are rising as a result of administration's attempts to sabotage Obamacare. Now oil prices rising. All things we all use weekly. I hope voters know whom to blame.
1158 2018-05-10 21:48:35 Managed to get oil changed, tire replaced, and alignment for just the cost of alignment. @MrsCarson4 is cooking steaks and veggies for dinner. It’s a good day.
1159 2018-05-10 21:48:33 Take Oil Companies money out of politics for a start! They fund Politicians & Governments worldwide therefore influencing Carbon & plastic pollution policy. We have alternative fuels & bio plastics..but dirty money holds back progress
1160 2018-05-10 21:48:27 What? Like, what? For real? He pulled us out of a war that Cheney put us in over oil.
1161 2018-05-10 21:48:17 Wait, you mean to tell me that Libra rising won't bless my charcoal and essential oil vaccine like madame stargazer promised?!
1162 2018-05-10 21:48:16 Yes. But I SHIRKED RESPONSIBILITIES. I’ll be paying for it by burning the midnight oil. Actually, I DELEGATED.  Everything was going well so...   Still, tomorrow is one LONG DAY.  Gather ye rosebuds.
1163 2018-05-10 21:47:56 bruhhh so I go get my oil changed and they laughing they ass off i’m like what’s so funny they say “baby girl yo truck loud asf here a couple air fresheners”  official done

1166 2018-05-10 21:47:12 Have u try cbd oil ?
1167 2018-05-10 21:46:28 As a consumer how can we be sure that corp'ns are using 'sustainable' #PalmOil? Do we simply take their word for it, or ask for further proof? I have seen so many tweets stating that no-one's checking to see if the palm oil's ACTUALLY from a sustainable source. #Confused
1168 2018-05-10 21:46:26 Still only $0.73/litre, which is some of the cheapest and subsidized gas in the world.  How would you like to pay $1.07 to $1.27/litre as we do in Canada (worlds 3rd largest oil reserves). U.S. gets 40% of their oil from Canada at huge discount also. Europe $5.80/Litre
1169 2018-05-10 21:46:06 DID YOU KNOW THIS?

With oil prices at $120 pb in 2014, only N152b was released for Power, Works, Housing, Defence, Transport & Agriculture. But with oil prices at $28 pb in 2016, Buhari released N578b for the 5 ministries.

Now you know!

1171 2018-05-10 21:45:59 That's why I Donald Trump and Putin are backing Israel this is going to be there excuse to go into Iran and still control of their oil and resources this was calculated way back when Donald Trump said that America should have stolen the oil the first time
1172 2018-05-10 21:45:57 War criminals. Started a war built on lies. Oil men. Defense contractors. Lots of profits.
Nevermind the hundreds of thousands of deaths, maiming, displacement, flood of refugees stressing other countries, and a whole country destroyed.
1173 2018-05-10 21:45:51 In the past week I've put 12 quarts of oil in my truck. This is not cool.
1174 2018-05-10 21:45:50 Blend 9 oz beer with 4 cups Cabbage. Mix in Olive Oil. Drain. Serve on salad
1175 2018-05-10 21:45:48 Iran's leaders wont use the Renminbi and wont price their oil on the petro-yuan exchange & wont use China's alternative to SWIFT. Iran using SWIFT and the Euro is still at the mercy of the west. If Iran waits until bombs are falling it is to late. It may be too late already.
1176 2018-05-10 21:45:45 Broccoli is one of the best vegetables! Try roasting with some slivers of almond and olive oil 
1177 2018-05-10 21:45:43 The journalist is just the guy who starts the fire so everybody can throw oil on it...
1178 2018-05-10 21:45:41 I'd like assure you that we're committed to sourcing with integrity, it's 1 our core values. Our Sustainability Plan commits us sourcing our palm oil sustainably & ensuring own brand products don’t contribute to global deforestation. Kyrie
1179 2018-05-10 21:45:40 This is all connected....let’s look...
Russia-Saudi Arabia need oil money...
Jared needs funding for 666..
Israel gets golan and more (it’s not biblical this is about fossils)
Jared needs funding for 666....
This is not hard to figure out...follow the money, you find the links
1180 2018-05-10 21:45:31 Taxes to subsidize oil and gas?    You must live in California
1181 2018-05-10 21:45:29 The penguin is back.  Determined to destroy the world to keep his oil profits high. Responsible for over a million deaths isn't enough, he wants more torture.
1182 2018-05-10 21:45:22 Al: I stand with the First Nations who are in favor of the pipeline. There are far more of them, and they will benefit when we stop supplying  Trump & friends with discounted  oil.
1183 2018-05-10 21:45:21 I normally used to add ghee and coconut oil, which normally kept me full till midday.
1184 2018-05-10 21:45:12 lemongrass is the gender bender of herbs. Add to foods to open up your sensuality and create more playfulness and exploration of your sexuality. Wear the oil to bring forth the anima or animus.
1185 2018-05-10 21:45:11 THIS CAR STINKS LIKE OIL. BETTER TRY TO FIX IT WITH MY FARTS AND ASS STANK. *moans involentarily*
1186 2018-05-10 21:45:05 The Iran and Israel war is calculated by Putin and Donald Trump they're making excuses to go in and steal Iranian oil they deliberately started this war Donald Trump played apart by pulling out of the agreement this was calculated from the beginning watch and learn
1187 2018-05-10 21:45:02 This gel makes my face so dry, I swear I'll start applying coconut oil on my face mang'lala, angeke phela!
1188 2018-05-10 21:44:53 Use of palm oil should be banned!
1189 2018-05-10 21:44:51 Completely agree, there is no reason to use it. We do not use palm oil in our products and we are plastic-free.
1190 2018-05-10 21:44:46 What essential oil do I use to fix this?

1193 2018-05-10 21:44:24 JuA said what they were told to say... The point is the he didnt die in the "drone attacks".

And remember Tonkin Bay? A There are so many other instances when you guys fooled your own taxpayers in to paying the war-profits of your bomb-makers and oil companies
1194 2018-05-10 21:44:24 After watching ‘The Red Ape: Saving the Orangutan’ on BBC2- I will not buy any product containing Palm Oil. Deforestation the size of a football pitch occurs every 27 seconds
1195 2018-05-10 21:44:23 Wore a white shirt today... managed to get raspberry vinaigrette, coffee and olive oil on it. Amazing
1196 2018-05-10 21:44:23 Jesus before anyone else  he is my light and my strength in times of darkness. he is the oil in my lamp which keep me going. he is my everything
1197 2018-05-10 21:44:15 You forgot to mention crude oil prices hitting a 3 year high being the reason for the surge in the reserves... This reality distortion field is not strong sir
1198 2018-05-10 21:44:09 Other oil seed crops don’t destroy rainforests the way #palmoil plantations do
1199 2018-05-10 21:44:04 The way you d smoke e be like say  them go change your engine oil. @Vector will not kill me with metaphor....

1203 2018-05-10 21:43:41 1)It's OIL sands. 2) there is already a pipeline, the KM proposal is to go along the same route that exists. 3) the technology now is cleaner than that the pipeline that is proposed to parallel it. 4) you are a hypocritical poseur.
1204 2018-05-10 21:43:30 Palm oil is in EVERYTHING from pies to conditioner and lipstick! 
Let's all check those labels... if everyone just stopped buying .. just think what a difference it could make! If there are no buyers, the market crumbles... pure economics! It's up to us! #PalmOil #rainforest

1212 2018-05-10 21:42:06 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
1213 2018-05-10 21:42:06 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1214 2018-05-10 21:41:54 I wanna try some CBD oil someone hook me up
1215 2018-05-10 21:41:43 It would be a few years before we has a sovereign oil fund of any significant size, but given the approach from Jeanne Freeman to the social security powers we now have, I’m sure SG’s approach to pensioners and less well off will be much more compassionate than at present.
1216 2018-05-10 21:41:43 Cue the demise of the oil
1217 2018-05-10 21:41:30 Check everything you for Sustainable palm oil or better still no palm oil content at all. Let's do as much as we can to save the Orangutan. Just watched the BBC program  'Red Ape' Saving the Orangutan and basically its down to the West to stop using palm oil #rainforest #palmoil
1218 2018-05-10 21:41:24 #RedApe is palm oil listed on a product label? #palmoil
1219 2018-05-10 21:41:16 Alex, 
Do you think all this war in Syria is because of the oil the Rothchilds want?
1220 2018-05-10 21:41:07 We do not use palm oil in our products and we are plastic-free. They are great alternatives out there, there is no reason to use it.

1237 2018-05-10 21:39:59 So all these jobs that COST money are supposed to offset the money we lose from oil and carbon?

This is going to be a disaster

1249 2018-05-10 21:39:08 #KitKat   This crap bar is loaded with PALM OIL.  Your killing off the Orangutans by clearing the rainforests, nothing left no Orangutans  which are much nicer than Kit Kat. Get rid of Palm Oil 
1250 2018-05-10 21:38:57 you could use olive oil or coconut oil but there’s tons of oils made specifically for hair
1251 2018-05-10 21:38:50 I have donated specifically to the Rungan River Peat Swamp Forest project to help #SavingtheOrangutan #RedApe Humans can be such bastards sometimes, I felt ashamed. Also going to be checking labels carefully from now on - if it's got palm oil it's going back on the shelf!
1252 2018-05-10 21:38:39 This is precisely why we do use palm oil in our products. They are great alternatives out there, there is no reason to use it.
1253 2018-05-10 21:38:30 @AldiUK hi, your name has appeared on an RSPO certified palm oil shopping list, that's fab news, is it all your products containing palm oil, only I haven't noticed any RSPO info on any of your packaging? Thanks
1254 2018-05-10 21:38:28 A) Olbas oil in the bath for colds, B) @pedalmeapp is the most fun you can have in London..
1255 2018-05-10 21:38:27 There's no such thing as sustainable palm oil. The palm oil industry has murdered 150,000 orangutans. And it won't stop until they are extinct.
1256 2018-05-10 21:38:23 .@powerthefuture @RyanAFournier They arec2 stupid yo know that evil oil makes their plastic iPads & iPhones  wheels, sandals
1257 2018-05-10 21:38:21 Another issue for Real Americans he will totally ignore. Fits his real goal to benefit the Rich, Oil Companies and Russia - what is for him not to like?
1258 2018-05-10 21:38:09 I agree, it’s so difficult finding products with no palm oil... or knowing which companies use palm but ethically sourced
1259 2018-05-10 21:37:56 Currently at the Midas waiting for an oil change
1260 2018-05-10 21:37:55 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts flaxseed oil with 1 part apple cider vinegar and 1 part peanut butter. Add shallots and honey to taste.
1261 2018-05-10 21:37:53 So many products contain palm oil...like Nutella!

1264 2018-05-10 21:37:28 That moment when your husband brings home olive oil without you asking, simply because he's been paying attention and knows you need it  #itsthelittlethings
1265 2018-05-10 21:37:13 @JohnStevensonMP  Did you see the BBC2 programme tonight regarding Borneo, Orangutans and Palm oil. It is a disgrace so what is your government going to do?
1266 2018-05-10 21:37:03 OIL.
1267 2018-05-10 21:36:59 I wonder if there'd ever be a fight for the reservation of women in jobs like mining, off-shore oil rigging etc.
1268 2018-05-10 21:36:46 The girl sitting next to me at graduation had an oil pen on her.. you could say we were both feeling highly educated!

1270 2018-05-10 21:36:38 Hey @Ford 

Do you really think it's a good idea to focus on SUVs and trucks when oil prices go up??? 

That position is unsustainable.
1271 2018-05-10 21:36:28 Are you saying you’re a vegetarian? How inconsiderate of them! They should add a picture of sliced zucchini with a drizzle of olive oil and a touch of vinegar 
1272 2018-05-10 21:36:17 I used to take SUCH good care of my hair years ago i’d do the no sulphates and no shampoo method and oil cleanse so much... now my hair is lucky if I wash it
1273 2018-05-10 21:36:15 "palm oil producers are wiping out orangutans" - we're killing apes, but at least we're also getting cancer #redape
1274 2018-05-10 21:36:15 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. 

Yet they are starving due to their socialism. 

BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
1275 2018-05-10 21:36:07 This is precisely why we do use palm oil in our products. They are great alternatives out there.
1276 2018-05-10 21:36:01 Then again, with the end of US participation in the Iran deal, Iran could start pumping out enormous quantities of oil, pushing down the price. Uh oh, how will Trump explain that one to Vlad?
1277 2018-05-10 21:36:00 The growth was as result increase in the prices of oil which does not translate to increase in jobs.the country  needs to diversify their economy by adding value to their primary commodities like gold,iron,aluminum ,timber ,cocoa etc.most Africa countries records high GDP growth

1279 2018-05-10 21:35:48 Hi, are products containing RSPO certified palm oil, labelled as such on the packaging? I can't say I've noticed when I've been looking at ingredients (mainly to avoid palm oil). @AldiUK in particular seems to use a lot of palm oil yet I've never noticed it being labelled RSPO
1280 2018-05-10 21:35:44 I made the switch to cook with nothing but coconut oil and I love the results!!
1281 2018-05-10 21:35:43 It is really hard to avoid palm oil if you buy packaged cookies, etc. Often the manufacturers use palm oil because it's cheap & only identify it as "vegetable oil" on the package. There are a number of petitions circulating to tell companies like Pepsi & Nestle to stop using it.
1282 2018-05-10 21:35:38 Glad to see oil & gas are "key" industries .... 4 yrs ago you were telling us that the oil was running out !  Thanks for clearing that up.
1283 2018-05-10 21:35:28 Propaganda machine >>> trying to connect those events!! Gas is cheap because the Republicans got their way to drill in 2008 (thank God Obama sold out) when we got whacked with $5/gal sh*t! Soon after we were oil independent...
1284 2018-05-10 21:35:22 @DermalogicaUK can you confirm that you don’t use palm oil in your products please #SavingTheOrangutan
1285 2018-05-10 21:35:13 walmart does oil changes for like $30
1286 2018-05-10 21:34:55 Damn i wonder if I should have mine looked at lmao I’ve had mine longer and have more miles  they didn’t say anything when I got a oil change though hmm
1287 2018-05-10 21:34:50 I wish someone would sue the pliant politicians who enabled and even encouraged the oil giants' behavior. After all, it's in a corporation's charter to pursue profits; elected officials, however, are supposed to protect the people.
1288 2018-05-10 21:34:40 Junckers and his mates are trying to appease Iran for its oil that's all
1289 2018-05-10 21:34:28 How about if a cover myself with baby oil?

Chocolate?
1290 2018-05-10 21:34:26 Most people do not understand how reliant Russia is on the price of oil. You are absolutely correct. This is an enormous gift to Putin which he desperately needs to use in his defense budget.

1293 2018-05-10 21:34:03 My fav moment was a dream: Godzilla was crushing the ISIS militants in Iraq, breathing fire on all their homes. He then opened his mouth wide and this fireball shot out and with his tongue sticking out you were driving your sprint car on his tongue, doing donuts, w/hand in air!
1294 2018-05-10 21:33:59 I am deeply sorry for your loss. Unfortunately our government is no stranger to false flag operations to sway public opinion one way or the other. Usually towards a war that they say is about freeing an oporrssed population, but it is most likely about oil, or energy.
1295 2018-05-10 21:33:43 Really, Pembina? I thought you supported a managed phase-out of the oil sands with a just transition for workers. Do you really see a future for growing bitumen extraction?
1296 2018-05-10 21:33:37 My 12 y/o boy has been leading us on this crusade for months. It’s hard going. I now take twice as long to shop as I check all the ingredients. It’s scary how many products contain palm oil. 
Still waiting for @LidlUK to get back to @Helenmwb about Easter eggs.

1299 2018-05-10 21:32:59 The supermarket Iceland’s decision to ditch palm oil from all of its own-brand products was in response to palm oil industry’s catastrophic failure to halt deforestation & deal with the problem...Chris Packham article @IcelandFoods #food #deforestation #orangutans
1300 2018-05-10 21:32:56 I once ate one in Nigeria, the eru was pounded and there was no drop of red oil in it. They called it “afang”
1301 2018-05-10 21:32:52 Truth does really matter. israel bombed syria first. 
israel continues to violate international laws & peace treaties then plays the victim. 
violating int law, israel illegally occupies Syrias golan heights & let genie energy drill for oil. #SyriaHasTheRightToActInSelfDefense.
1302 2018-05-10 21:32:48 Lots of oil takes and forecasts without much number crunching. It's a good opportunity to be real slow and patient. Was posting about tedious work b4...now THIS is tedious.
1303 2018-05-10 21:32:40 Oil

1306 2018-05-10 21:32:20 Go look yourself. Iranian oil production plummeted after it was nationalized or stolen from the companies who developed those oil fields using the technology

1314 2018-05-10 21:31:50 We did, we all cried and we’ve given up palm oil shite and Nutella. I’ve also tweeted them to give them some grief
1315 2018-05-10 21:31:21 Is anyone among you troubled?Let them pray. Is anyone happy?Let them sing songs of praise. Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them & anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord & the prayer offered in faith will make the sick well.
1316 2018-05-10 21:31:16 Rising oil prices as a result of the US pulling out of the Iran nuclear may lead to further increases in inflation, meaning BoE may well have to revisit rates at some stage. A weak economy, rising inflation and interest rates isn’t a good mix

1329 2018-05-10 21:29:54 Al Gore, please come to Washington State to drive home the point to @washdems leadership about this. They're far too quiet about it, even as it would be devastating to our waterways, orcas, and would be a huge win for the oil industry/loss for climate.
1330 2018-05-10 21:29:52 I tossed that in the garlic oil and cooked them through for a bit (enough to soften them just a smidge, not so long the zoodles would get watery). Took the pan off the heat, added minced parsley, freshly shaved Parmesan, lemon juice, and the chunks of grilled chicken.
1331 2018-05-10 21:29:50 The issuers and owners of most Hi Yield wants oil higher. Most JNK bonds were issued to oil co's. market tanked w oil in 2015 for fear of impaired loans w oil where it was. Fed had to back off and re engineer oil higher. That was the feds job. OIL>loans in the banking system.
1332 2018-05-10 21:29:49 all the oil from my skin has been stripped from mt hands and i want to......Pewish
1333 2018-05-10 21:29:45 God bless. Today my time estimate for the oil change is a 25 minute wait as opposed to "hours"
1334 2018-05-10 21:29:44 Oil & Water and Portal are great too! I love all her metaphors
1335 2018-05-10 21:29:36 right on schedule, watch the press explosions of the obvious to all treason matched like scud missiles to the volleys of a full mideast proxy war of distraction and oil price propping, but it won't hide the truth
1336 2018-05-10 21:29:36 So Honda just tried to price gouge me for over a hundred bucks for an oil change and air filters. The former I can get done for a quarter of the price elsewhere. The later I can do myself. Never go to dealership services.
1337 2018-05-10 21:29:22 I guess I will join the oil sand workers in Alberta to complain when it comes...
1338 2018-05-10 21:29:16 Putin today sits as the undisputed Oil Czar of planet earth... Arctic and Antarctic oil promise dwarfs all remaining oil supplies in middle east... Neocons want middle east oil but know it's remaining supply is limited.... Apparently USA is their leverage to curry future deals.?
1339 2018-05-10 21:29:11 He's a grifter, & he worked with a foreign country to manipulate our election. By the way, how's the snake oil?
1340 2018-05-10 21:29:03 Laughing stock in the eyes of Nigerians. Obj- is it because of no more oil blocks for ya? This time it’s ok to cry wolf.
1341 2018-05-10 21:29:00 Check for scale and sooty mould on Lilly Polly trees. Drench with soapy #water, spray with white oil, or squash with your fingers
1342 2018-05-10 21:28:50 I just improvised it. Sautéed some thinly sliced garlic cloves in a couple of tablespoons of olive oil on medium-low heat till the garlic was pale gold, added red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper. When the garlic was golden, added the spiralized zucchini.
1343 2018-05-10 21:28:50 Ship me 1K Italian pub subs on white bread with cucumbers, no onions, and olive oil. 
1344 2018-05-10 21:28:47 That’s what trump wants, so that his friends at the oil companies keep getting richer and the rest of us poorer. That’s the main reason he pull us out of the Iranian deal!!!
1345 2018-05-10 21:28:45 gotta get oil from somewhere
1346 2018-05-10 21:28:30 Red ape WE DID THIS. It was OUR want of wonderful Rubber Tree products that got impoverished Malaysia to rip out its forests & its grubbed out for Palm oil. It is consumer led. THAT MEANS YOU & ME.
1347 2018-05-10 21:28:27 my hair is damaged from how much heat I use on it and so I put coconut oil in it and then put a shower cap on to keep in contained and I LITERALLY look like an EGG
1348 2018-05-10 21:28:24 Dems should megaphone Trump damage: tariffs leading to job loss, taxscam benefitting corps. over people. EPA benefitting profits over health, Iran sanctions benefitting Russia & raising oil/gas prices, threats to Medicare/social sec.,net neutrality, science, climate. People care!
1349 2018-05-10 21:28:05 Only ones that tase bad are the ones with a coconut oil base since coconut oil is nasty. But the smoothie ones honestly just taste like a mixture of the fruits/ foods I mix together for them. Not as sweet has a human one cause no added sugars but all natural fruits and yogurt
1350 2018-05-10 21:27:50 Oil change and tire rotation... not sure why I’m doing this after work instead of Saturday morning tho
1351 2018-05-10 21:27:45 Went back To Indiana 2 Years Ago For The 500. Ended up at Lawrenceburg for an Outlaw race. The locals around us said "Rico who?" When you came out. They knew your name after that night!
1352 2018-05-10 21:27:30 He need a oil enema for all the suffering he has cause
1353 2018-05-10 21:27:21 Well.. being off for a few days with unbelievable sunburn and covered in blisters I can quite easily say that was the HOTTEST Iv ever been in the kitchen... I’m on fuckin fire 
Lesson learned gingers should not use oil whilst sat in the sun
1354 2018-05-10 21:27:21 Time of Trump’s election crude oil at $26 a barrel, today its at $77 a barrel. Putin loves all the winning move from Donnie!
1355 2018-05-10 21:27:20 so. we were cleaning out the print shop today. couple things. 1) i bent back one of my fingernails and wow that hurt. 2) my hands still smell like vegetable oil
1356 2018-05-10 21:27:05 I'm not confused.
I was proving a point about who receives most Iranian oil and it's not the Russians nor do they "profit" from all this.

1359 2018-05-10 21:26:51 I was kinda a DAN  but omg.  Oil sands. Not tarsands ffs.  Come let us show u reclaimed land  and the environmental protection.  Eastern liberal supporters haven't z clue
1360 2018-05-10 21:26:49 Pulling out of the Iran deal is not adversely hampering our allies ability to sell their oil to the world market.
1361 2018-05-10 21:26:44 My diffuser and this eucalyptus oil have been helping me sleep so much better at night. I haven’t woken up in the middle of the night gasping for air since I’ve started using it. Pollen thought it had me....
1362 2018-05-10 21:26:38 Nothing like getting used motor oil in your fur :<
1363 2018-05-10 21:26:38 I agree. Overpayment. I just wonder how desperate oil fans would be for that elusive 1 dman
1364 2018-05-10 21:26:34 I think Putin has to worry that T will lose his usefulness soon one way or another.  Putin needs to wring him out fast

Did you know that Russia is world's #1 oil producer, lately even out-producing Saudi Arabia?
1365 2018-05-10 21:26:30 My psych is very good. He's treating my depression with high dose Fish Oil since Antidepressants are a no go for me. I was skeptical, but it does help a bit. He listens to me & is very positive. I would rather not have to take Vyvanse however I've tried everything else.
1366 2018-05-10 21:26:25 Popcorn are normally cooked in the same pot over the same temperature with the same oil but they don't all pop at the same time. Never compete in life different paths different paces different strengths
1367 2018-05-10 21:26:24 Gotta bite the bullet and get a vape pen and some cbd oil
1368 2018-05-10 21:26:23 Hear hear! Yes it will be tricky to only eat ethical palm oil products, but it is doable & certainly isn't as bad as what the Orangutans face! Yes, as individuals we may feel insignificant, but as a collective we can create a big enough impact that will make companies listen.
1369 2018-05-10 21:26:06 Well it all ended in disaster  Bloody dog found and ate some palm oil  just this second got back from the emergency vets... we’ll have to stick to the countryside 
1370 2018-05-10 21:25:59 #latedebaterte I bet you anything that Trumpty Warmonger's actions have increased the share prices of arms and oil so many of his wonderful supporters will be rubbing their hands in glee whilst thousands of victims children women and men will die as a result!
1371 2018-05-10 21:25:57 ...palm oil completely as another, worse crop will take its place. Ensuring that the two live in harmony means that Malaysia & Indonesia won’t suffer economically & conservation efforts will be much better. Harrowing images but hopefully the best way to get the message across.
1372 2018-05-10 21:25:52 any of y'all ever had that salad that's just like tomatoes and cheese sliced up together covered in olive oil. Idk the name of it but it's good
1373 2018-05-10 21:25:35 does anyone have any tips on making 3b-3c hair less frizzy without coconut oil
1374 2018-05-10 21:25:32 Totally agree... Some rusted out hulk of an old oil tanker off the coast of Morrocco would be a great start...

1375 2018-05-10 21:25:24 TAC 4: We are checking a yellow liquid spewing from the ground near an oil/gas well site near 17700 block N. Pennsylvania. Hazardous Materials Team has been requested. -BF 4:25 p.m.

1377 2018-05-10 21:25:10 Did you get a shot of steroid and a shot of rocephin? Literally the only thing that knocks mine out. But natural people say garlic oil or something like that haha
1378 2018-05-10 21:25:09 We have enough oil reserves and natural gas reserves and coal reserves to be a net exporter of each for the next 100 years, but #Democrats won't let us at them. And as an OTR trucker, I know the more #Leftist a state is, the higher the fuel costs.
1379 2018-05-10 21:24:51 Having a car is great until I have to pay for gas , an oil change or any other random shit 
1380 2018-05-10 21:24:38 Thanks Mike.  That sounds more reasonable as I couldn't connect the dots with oil prices.  Also, great job on your recent podcast.  Keep sharing your stories at the start of each podcast.  I like it.  Only watched one episode of Blacklist but now I will try a few more!  Cheers.
1381 2018-05-10 21:24:34 Just like Abuja isn't "collecting part of the extra allocation as oil producing states", right?
1382 2018-05-10 21:24:34 Or like she wears a pointy cap. And we all have onion rings. And we hurl them at her trying to get them onto the hat. "WE LIKE IT. WE WANNA PUT A RING ON IT" we scream, eyes protruding, voices bloodless and hoarse. The altar is shrouded in oil. We drown. There are no survivors.
1383 2018-05-10 21:24:24 So, the stock market dropped 3,000 since January. The only gains are those speculators in oil. Gas is $4.00. Wow, he’s a smart guy. 
1384 2018-05-10 21:24:22 #PNAC2018 The blueprint framed by these neocons was never abandoned... It morphed into Tea Party , Bannons Nationalist GOP wing.. etc, etc... It's not Trumps vision.. It's the Republicans vision... Oil,oil and more oil baby... All about who controls and profits from global oil
1385 2018-05-10 21:24:10 #RedApe was incredible and I love that the message was sustainable palm oil rather than banning it completely. I’m lucky enough to have been to Malaysian Borneo many times and I’ve written about the human/orang conflict in Borneo and think it’s super important not to boycott...
1386 2018-05-10 21:24:09 also, are all the hemp oil things pyramid schemes?
1387 2018-05-10 21:24:06 This programme#RedApe was heartbreaking. Borneo you have the most beautiful forests & you destroy them! Shame on you! Palm oil is pure liquid EVIL #PalmOil #Borneo #orangutan
1388 2018-05-10 21:24:02 Helps Putin a whole lot having oil at a high price. Trump is causing panic among the oil traders with his irresponsible actions on the Iran Deal

1390 2018-05-10 21:23:57  hey oil buddy
1391 2018-05-10 21:23:53 Coal and oil driven AI is the future, right?
1392 2018-05-10 21:23:39 
1393 2018-05-10 21:23:38 The answer is simple. Don't buy anything with palm oil in it. Of course it's not that easy... I make biscuits at McDonald's and a key ingredient is palm oil. 
1394 2018-05-10 21:23:28 @realDonaldTrump Solar will bring jobs, the oil only makes the rich richer.
1395 2018-05-10 21:23:26 Don’t talk too much poop.    You ran a car without oil.   Just saying
1396 2018-05-10 21:23:26 Yes, I was "crying" when it was $4+. But not as I watched it go down, down, down as President Obama got control of the GWB mess & pulled us out of the nosedive off the cliff. 
Oil prices are at their highest in more than 3 years and look to be on continued rise. 
Time will tell.
1397 2018-05-10 21:23:21 @nahidroxan Would you please name few items that Russia produces besides bombs, oil& gas? Drive a russian car? washing machine russian? Why the ardent support for #Russia

1407 2018-05-10 21:22:00 She's telling Putin he can stay in the Ukraine as long as he wishes so long as the oil and natural gas from Siberia flows to Western Europe because no one GAF about the Ukrainians,Georgians,Azerbaijan,Uzhbekistan,Turkmenistan.etc,etc.

1409 2018-05-10 21:21:54 They are not mutually exclusive.  In fact, one could argue they are intertwined, so much as a steady demand for oil goes.  Every nation bases strategic decisions on $$$.
1410 2018-05-10 21:21:27 So we have been reducing our plastic consumption for about a year now and have succeeded in all of our changes but I think our next focus has to be palm oil... I don’t even know where to begin! #RedApe #plasticpollution

1416 2018-05-10 21:21:04 Hey Cubby Bear! Looks like that's just a hunk of coconut oil that didn't get mixed all the way into the bar (we make everything in small batches by hand, so these variations happen). We're happy to replace the bar though! We'll follow up via DM and take care of you.

1420 2018-05-10 21:20:50 Did you talk about how Quebec killed Energy east pipeline, while still importing hundreds of thousands of bbl's of foreign oil/day?  Did you talk about Quebec's Saguenay Energy LNG project? How about offshore oil drilling on East coast while stopping it out west?
1421 2018-05-10 21:20:36 Had to visit a palm oil plantation earlier this year and will never forget the smells; noise and dirt I encountered.

1431 2018-05-10 21:19:36 I remember the 2012 "there will never be another $50 barrel of oil pulled out of the ground" mantra, too.  When you hear "never" and oil, either buy, or sell, as appropriate.
1432 2018-05-10 21:19:27 so ive just put coconut oil and lemon juice in my hair, #antigreyformula lol... feels all damp and horrible.. dunno if i can keep doing it.

1434 2018-05-10 21:19:15 "untested herb has been the norm for 99.5% of history with minimal health impact" - Just a reminder that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. I agree the HC should require pesticide testing for apprvd PCP; but, some would be impossible to test for (e.g. sulfur or oil)

1447 2018-05-10 21:17:53 off topic.  Putin wants higher oil price, and perhaps, Trump gave him that?
1448 2018-05-10 21:17:41 No, if you see my previous tweets it’s because companies using non sustainable palm oil is killing off the Orangutan due to rain forest deforestation 
1449 2018-05-10 21:17:24 This assumes the market stays the same. Another oil spike and we’re back in the rush to smaller cars. People have amnesia.
1450 2018-05-10 21:17:21 Note to self...next time don't store the oil for the lawnmower next to lighter fluid for the grill.

1457 2018-05-10 21:16:19 Hillary, both Putin and the Koch Bros benefit enormously from skyrocketing oil prices due to Middle East turmoil & uncertainty or war.  That is the plan right there.
1458 2018-05-10 21:16:18 And in clicks or dischem, get yourself the caival fusion oil. It's a mix of every oil your hair would ever want. Works wonders. I'll DM you a picture of it
1459 2018-05-10 21:16:05 Damn I’m out of oil buuut tomorrow paydayyy 
1460 2018-05-10 21:15:50 @sullivanradio Burn oil? This is California. What are you thinking? We even need permission to burn wood for heat on a day by day basis!
1461 2018-05-10 21:15:43 Just watched a programme about the decline of the Orang Utan in Borneo due to deforestation and the 'need' for sodding palm oil. I'm sure we can do without the bloody stuff. Mankind sucks. 
1462 2018-05-10 21:15:35 We’ve got to stop buying palm oil. Boycott the hell out of it. You’ve all heard of it. Take a stance and save our Orangutans. Now.
1463 2018-05-10 21:15:33 Oil price fixing by OPEC, IRAN deal pull out, makes the markets nervous, uncertainty about NK. Job growth is not at its lowest pace in years. 3M jobs added in less than 18 months. Facts please
1464 2018-05-10 21:15:33 Maybe traditional media attract more conservative artists? Plein air oil painters seem to be a relatively conservative lot.
1465 2018-05-10 21:15:33 If oil prices keep being forced up through instability around the world, Russian profits will rise dramatically.
1466 2018-05-10 21:15:29 Ah, have been reading. Sustainability is the key. Massive company like @Unilever need to go to sustainable palm oil. Dropping prices is not the key as more will be grown for fuel.
1467 2018-05-10 21:15:29 Yeah where were all these "best value" guys when canadian oil stocks were lying on the ground with a stake through the heart.  :)
1468 2018-05-10 21:15:23 The USA has been shipping Alaskan oil down this corridor for over 30 years. These new shipments are heading out to sea across the Pacific. Wake up a goof is running the US now. He is the beast that is a goof.
1469 2018-05-10 21:15:19 @margbrennan @FaceTheNation "Crude oil futures have leapt from $26 at the time of Trump’s election to $77 today." IRAN SANCTIONS raises oil prices DRAMATICALLY INCREASING THE PROFITS $$$ RUSSIA MAKES ON OIL SALES! Is Trump's gift to Putin being covered?
1470 2018-05-10 21:15:12 I'll give you bonus points if you are pan frying anything on a high heat that spits oil.
1471 2018-05-10 21:15:10 That font and colour scheme combination makes me want to buy a petrol additive or high tech synthetic oil. Weird choice.
1472 2018-05-10 21:15:05 That played a role too. Israel is a useful client state for the US because they're basically a military base in an oil-rich region that we can use as a proxy to fight our oil wars.
1473 2018-05-10 21:15:03 Or no palm oil.
1474 2018-05-10 21:15:02 am so glad wen u speak for the voiceless. were r the rich northerners like dangote, Atiku, Sultan of sokoto, Sanusi Lamido, and their likes that has oil wells in the south. They only care abwt their pocket and families, were r the so-called Arewa forum?
1475 2018-05-10 21:15:01 My favorite Rico moment is when he won his first Golden Driller at Chili Bowl! Its always a good time to see him, @KyleLarsonRacin and @CBellRacing walking the track and waving to us fans! Also, this past Chili Bowl Rico playing with the unicorn in turn 2 with lil Owen.
1476 2018-05-10 21:14:52 We should not buy oil from any country where women can't vote, we should not make nuke deals with any country where women can't vote, I don't wear a hat and I don't want to be forced to cover my head, I don't want anyone to be forced to cover their head, it just ain't right.
1477 2018-05-10 21:14:46 Hey I'm not sure how to work tweeter but I have a picture of that Jamaican oil. Tweet me your #, and I'm saling chocolate covered strawberries and cupcakes for mother's day
1478 2018-05-10 21:14:36 That's been on the ME oil & resources agenda for more than a decade - tell us something we don't already know.
1479 2018-05-10 21:14:34 The ruble and oil prices are skyrocketing so someone’s happy.
1480 2018-05-10 21:14:29 Yo @MathengeKanyoro spotted you at Oil Libya Westi. 
Emi is beautiful.
1481 2018-05-10 21:14:22 A great shame. I only hope enough people watched it to think before they buy. Things have got to change and we need to stop using palm oil in products.  It's nothing more than a bulking agent but is still found in so many things.
1482 2018-05-10 21:14:13 #rtept Golan heights belongs to Syria,Israel took it and US oil company's are in there stealing the country's oil.and MSM are blaming Syria.
1483 2018-05-10 21:14:11 Says the oil companies who continue to get wealthier.
1484 2018-05-10 21:14:10 Just watched @BBCTwo 'Red Ape saving the orangutang' 

Pretty horrific what we have done to this species and the rain forest in Borneo, and it's all down to palm oil. 

Palm oil is in lots of everyday products and I'm certainly going to check from now on. #PalmOil #orangutans
1485 2018-05-10 21:14:08 There is no requirement to put a capping stack on the oil drill rig and nearest one is 2 weeks away in Norway. That's how hollow safety plans for NS deep water oil approval by energy @ec_minister rest is just picking up plastics for photo ops.
1486 2018-05-10 21:14:08 Trump pulling out of Iran is just payback to Putin. This will make Russia lots of money from oil. This is a con job and America will pay dearly for it. Remember, Trump cares only about himself. Not his base and not America.
#DontheCon
#TrumpIsGuilty
1487 2018-05-10 21:14:00 Came in for an oil change and leaving with a new tire as well 
1488 2018-05-10 21:14:00 Think we can all agree that palm oil shouldn’t be unsustainable anymore then. Now we all need to do our bit to make that happen just like we’re going to do with dramatically reducing plastic packaging and disposable coffee cups #RedApe #BluePlanet2 #action
1489 2018-05-10 21:13:53 When US starts embargo for iranian oil and gas? Russian oil an gas?
1490 2018-05-10 21:13:49 Oil my friend. Oil

1495 2018-05-10 21:13:09 Shea butter & coconut oil together >
1496 2018-05-10 21:13:01 Governments need to ban palm oil.
1497 2018-05-10 21:12:42 pipelines and oil rigs are taking over Blaine Co. 
1498 2018-05-10 21:12:37 I hate when you go get an oil change and these fuckers try to bring up everything wrong. Like bitch stick to the oil change and stfu lol
1499 2018-05-10 21:12:35 Oil vs Green Oil

Sounds weak but not
1500 2018-05-10 21:12:28 been following dal pretty closely myself...and yes, think it's ready to go (for real this time).  airlines at bottom of channel, oil at top of channel...feels like a matter of time.
1501 2018-05-10 21:12:19 Would definitely recommend watching red ape on BBC, really highlights the signaficance of supermarkets dropping palm oil.
1502 2018-05-10 21:12:14 You see, by using the time-tested botanical oil extraction methods used by other industries, such as cooking oils, distillate oils are the closest thing to an essential oil of cannabis, which provides optimum purity.
1503 2018-05-10 21:12:11 Hi I wanna look like I see the world through twin oil spills
1504 2018-05-10 21:12:01 Shacabkan mar wal ciidamo shisheeye ahi xasuuqayaan dawladii ay doorteen waxay mashquul ku tahay Oil Exploration ayna leeyihiin madaxdii dalalka ciidamadan xasuuqa gaysanayaa ay ka soo jeedaan.
1505 2018-05-10 21:11:59 olbas oil is a freakin lifesaver
1506 2018-05-10 21:11:56 Ban palm oil. Simple
1507 2018-05-10 21:11:55 Oh I LOVE the smell of Olbas Oil! I douse everything in it too when I have a cold - will steer clear of the eyes tho ... ouch!! It’s herbal - I buy dissolvable ones - bit like vitamin c drink!!
1508 2018-05-10 21:11:48 no. he should listen to his allies and try work out a deal rather than walk away as usual will all be about the price of a barrel of US oil
1509 2018-05-10 21:11:44 Your hair doesn't look that thick in pics but maybe that's all the coconut oil 
1510 2018-05-10 21:11:44 How have I never brushed melted butter on my professional account about an oil pipeline.
1511 2018-05-10 21:11:38 Was in @AirfieldEstate recently and loads signs up about knowing where your food is from, then pick up pack of ready to make bread and it contains palm oil , so disappointing to see .
1512 2018-05-10 21:11:34 @BBCEarth More programmes like this need to be shown around the World to raise awareness of the devastation caused by palm oil. Thank you BBC for putting it out there.
1513 2018-05-10 21:11:19 It’s Thursday and I’ve been running around adulting. 
Pet food

Can I go home? 
#tired #adulting
1514 2018-05-10 21:11:13 The capitalist billionaire siphon off the world's oil into their tankers, while millions have to burn manure for heat.
1515 2018-05-10 21:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza of the day will be: chewy crust with sweet coconut oil and ham.
1516 2018-05-10 21:10:44 二度寝しよ…？/////
1517 2018-05-10 21:10:40 Oooooh I see, aw babe I’m sure you’ll still look bangin for your bday though! If anything just oil up them legs and slide into the skirt 
1518 2018-05-10 21:10:30 would she use marijuana and CBD Oil, to help?
1519 2018-05-10 21:10:19 Hi Martin. I would like to assure you that we are committed to sourcing with integrity, it is one of our core values. Our Sustainability Plan commits us to sourcing our palm oil sustainably and ensuring our own brand... 1/2
1520 2018-05-10 21:10:18 they got him into the showers with some "oil cutting" soap really quickly, so he was fine in an hour.  but good grief, nothing beats that face as the itch starts.
discomfort, then confusion, then fear, then OMG POISON OAK ON MY JUNK!!!!
1521 2018-05-10 21:10:10 @GordonRamsay My sisters Culinary Instructer says cold oil, cold pan. Is she a twat? Yay, or nay?
1522 2018-05-10 21:10:10 Had the worst evening ever!!!! First a widget spinner bit me. Then a pair of cheap new look sunglasses bit me. Then a bloody bottle of kiehls midnight recovery oil bit me!! Is everything in this house out to get me???
1523 2018-05-10 21:10:07 サラダ油は野菜って言ったら変な顔されたよ。サラダってついてるのに本当に馬鹿だなあ。
1524 2018-05-10 21:10:02 They didn't need zionist to be wealthy. Any International Oil company contacting them would have made their wealth.
1525 2018-05-10 21:10:02 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
1526 2018-05-10 21:09:50 Was heartbreaking watching #RedApe on BBC2 tonight. I feel much more informed about palm oil and the devastating consequences of rainforest deforestation on this species . The future of orang utans is literally in our hands!
1527 2018-05-10 21:09:45 Just watched Red Ape with my mumma, she now understands why I’m constantly ranting about palm oil! She made me go round the kitchen checking which of our food contains the stuff... such an eye opener 
1528 2018-05-10 21:09:41 PSA please stop using fram oil filters, they are  too restrictive on most cars!!
1529 2018-05-10 21:09:40 Nah it’s more like Arabian man without oil beard
1530 2018-05-10 21:09:40 I cried. 
I despaired at human's cruelty 
I was moved by human's dedication 
I am overwhelmed because palm oil is in nearly everything
But we have to make an effort. As the amazing vet said: 'Even if it's just one organutan' #RedApe
1531 2018-05-10 21:09:38 trump is doing exactly what putin told him to. Gotta lift them Russian sanctions do the oligarchs can make that trillion dollar oil deal. Destabilize Iran and cut their oil supply off to make trillions more. North Korea is a trumputin distraction so they can CONspire against us.
1532 2018-05-10 21:09:38 Elisha replied to her, “How can I help you? Tell me, what do you have in your house?”“Your servant has nothing there at all,” she said, “except a small jar of olive oil.” 2Kings 4:2

Don't discount the small things in your life God can use to bring blessing.
1533 2018-05-10 21:09:38 Whole oil filter dont emptied on my shoulder I'm fucking done!
1534 2018-05-10 21:09:35 #RedApe
#PalmOil 
Never ever have, and never ever will, use Palm oil in our soap. 
How can anyone knowingly use it in anything after tonight's programme?
1535 2018-05-10 21:09:30 Ok I’m gonna trip you out!!! The best ever. Let it thaw then put veg. Oil half up the frying pan, put the hot pocket in the hot oil, when golden brown, take it out of the oil & put it on a paper towel! Will change your life. You heard it here first!!!!
1536 2018-05-10 21:09:30 So you got no problems with oil tankers from other countries rolling in to English bay
1537 2018-05-10 21:09:25 Shitty brake pads replaced
Shitty battery replaced
Just need an oil change and I think I'm good on semi-critical car maintenance for a minute
1538 2018-05-10 21:09:22 The entire Middle East Region is suffering from the action of Netanyahu. Saudi  Family don't owe anything to "Israel". Saudi Arabia made its wealth with oil, that oil belongs to them. Dealing with all Country would have made them rich.
1539 2018-05-10 21:09:21 The main benefactors Of palm oil need to be boiled in it
1540 2018-05-10 21:09:20 おはようございます
ハロアイがんばってね
1541 2018-05-10 21:09:12 Friend of mine peels an orange and eats it slowly. Or uses peppermint or lavender essential oil on a tissue or sprinkled on the bed or room
1542 2018-05-10 21:09:10 I think that apology/£500k payout thing was a bribe to a Libyan politician to get an oil deal. #BBCNews
1543 2018-05-10 21:09:02 @AldiUK when are you going to make a palm oil pledge? Sustainable palm oil only please! #savetheorangutan
1544 2018-05-10 21:09:01 Oil has touched $77pb and this country is still like this??
1545 2018-05-10 21:08:48 Actually no, Vadim. Trudeau is good "friends" with trump because he's another fake woke neoliberal who would lick Trump's boots if it meant more oil money in his pocket

Nothing Trudeau ever does fundamentally contradicts any of what Trump stands for.

Of course Trudeau is garbag
1546 2018-05-10 21:08:42 my booty and thighs have never been so smooth, coconut oil is my best friend
1547 2018-05-10 21:08:39 Also (very late to congratulate I know) so happy @IcelandFoods has banned palm oil. Never shopped there before but I will now! Leading the way 
1548 2018-05-10 21:08:36 @GMC @mtbarra was going to run to grocery store, but I gotta check oil! It is like a 1919 Harley, complete loss system. Ahh modern engineering at gmc
1549 2018-05-10 21:08:27 Time of Trump’s election barrel of Crude Oil $26 per barrel, today it’s a $77 a barrel. Putin keeps on winning with high oil prices!
1550 2018-05-10 21:08:25 Sadly the RSPO is failing too. Chris explains why in the article. Palm Oil Innovation Group (POIG) is the org to look out for x
1551 2018-05-10 21:08:19 hi mark. me personally... i'm now informed of the severity of the situ by watching the program & obvs be careful buying products w palm oil. that alright?
1552 2018-05-10 21:08:08 I'm a proud Marine, did my job, and would do it again....BUT....you give me way too much credit....I worked for the Military Industrial Complex & the Oil Companies...I didn't secure anyone's freedom...at least not any Americans'. 

We cleaned up what politicians screwed up.
1553 2018-05-10 21:08:06 @Chartwells_UK Please can you let me know whether my childs school dinners provided by yourselves are palm oil free? #RedApe #greenpeaceuk #ethicalfood #schooldinners
1554 2018-05-10 21:07:43 @SirDavidBBC David, how would you suggest we deal with the Palm Oil crisis?..
1555 2018-05-10 21:07:40 I have been looking at labels for a long time and have known about the plight of these wonderful apes. I have not knowingly bought anything with Palm oil for a couple of years
1556 2018-05-10 21:07:37 One of the last places I want to be after a long day of work is waiting at the mechanic for my car to be serviced. It seems like everyone else had the same idea I did to get an oil change today.
1557 2018-05-10 21:07:34 That's it. No more products containing palm oil will be bought in this household. That is going to be tricky as it is in almost EVERYTHING! However, it will be done. #ditchpalmoil #palmoilalarmcall
1558 2018-05-10 21:07:28 Just another example of the USA’s quest for global economic dominance.  You guys will do everything it takes to curb our industry, and enjoy the safe supply of oil we are forced to sell u at discount. #Canada
1559 2018-05-10 21:07:12 @BBCYork Did you watch “Red Ape” on BBC 2? I volunteered at the centre Karmelle runs in 2015 when I went over to see the issues with Palm Oil as some sweets contain it. Hope it has the impact “Blue Planet” did
1560 2018-05-10 21:07:04 shea moisture black soap w tea tree oil is really the BOMB
1561 2018-05-10 21:06:58 It’s also a gift to the Saudi oil industry.
1562 2018-05-10 21:06:52 Is that like albus oil? I stung my eyes with that once after wiping my face with a tissue my wife had impregnated. Blooming heck
1563 2018-05-10 21:06:45 I bet it involves palm oil.
1564 2018-05-10 21:06:44 Red Ape: Saving the Orangutan @BBCTwo is horrifying. I’m checking everything for palm oil from now on.

1571 2018-05-10 21:06:16 Scheer conveniently omits that the CAD-USD exchange rate is down by almost 40% since then. Mostly because the USA does not need our oil like before. So much squawking and so little intelligence.
1572 2018-05-10 21:06:14 Don’t know how anybody can think anything good can come from palm oil. It leaves the rainforest looking like Mordor, leads to loss of biodiversity and is linked to cancer growth. Leave that shit out of our food and our supermarkets 
1573 2018-05-10 21:06:09 I think rising oil prices is better than world war 3
1574 2018-05-10 21:06:08 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.

1577 2018-05-10 21:06:06 @sainsburys when are u gonna ban palm oil products?? #savetheredape
1578 2018-05-10 21:06:01 Soon we will read about an increase in public sector salaries ;-) that’s how our policy makers reacted and will react to any changes in oil prices.
1579 2018-05-10 21:05:51 Yes, you're doing great things for the Russian economy by pulling out of the Iran deal. Putin must be so proud of you. Ruble and Russian oil prices increasing.
1580 2018-05-10 21:05:49 I have no idea but should be available online if not! Just finished watching and I'm so angry at the palm oil industry.
1581 2018-05-10 21:05:42 if u dont mix baby oil w your lotion wyd?
1582 2018-05-10 21:05:37 In the oil patch its almost a necessity back in 2014 it was 20 hour days for a month straight for this guy. Crazier times, happier times. Habs were good and the Leafs still sucked :/
1583 2018-05-10 21:05:36 The first thing you can do for me is chuck all your products containing non-sustainable palm oil into the biggest fucking dustbin you can find

1586 2018-05-10 21:05:07 I’m pretty sure @dunkindonuts could pour motor oil into a cup and give it to me and I’d still say “thank you so much”
1587 2018-05-10 21:05:06 Aye ok  EPL consists ae more tinpot clubs like Bournemouth, Brighton, Huddersfield, Watford, Palace, Wolves than there is big clubs  - there’s only 4 well known clubs in the Prem  then yeev got oil fc for champions 
1588 2018-05-10 21:05:01 There's no need for palm oil.need to find other products/jobs for those communities.
1589 2018-05-10 21:05:00 Is it a cancellation fee? U can get that back in credit on the app but yh email them if u want the actual money back , they’re quick to take money for any oil thing but slow to immediately refund 
1590 2018-05-10 21:04:50 It is reported now that having U.S. pull out of the deal is leading to a rise in the ruble and Russian oil prices.

1592 2018-05-10 21:04:44 Just watched the documentary about orangutan's endangered 
For palm oil , makes me ashamed to be human #sheargreed & should be treated as criminal activity.

1594 2018-05-10 21:04:35 By Iraqi military, not American. The same Iraq whose oil u thought we should just take. Also, Baghdad is still at large. So how can the top five most wanted be captured when the guy in charge is not? U still can’t prove the guy is dead!
1595 2018-05-10 21:04:32 @realDonaldTrump  Mr President explain to me why gas is rising when we are exporting more oil than any other country. I thought the purpose was to make us independent from oil producing nation's. It may be good for businesses but what about the fixed and low income Americans.
1596 2018-05-10 21:04:09 #RedApe eating some #Aftereights look at ingredients - palm oil. Will not buy again.

1598 2018-05-10 21:04:00 Louisiana did not give millions of $$$ under this Governor. The one before, bankrupt the state. LA receives the 2nd least I’m oil revenue even though it is the biggest industry here.  We are another state that proves trickle down doesn’t work
1599 2018-05-10 21:04:00 I’ll definitely be trying tea tree oil 
1600 2018-05-10 21:04:00 They use to dry faced hoes not none with a lil oily oil on they skin
1601 2018-05-10 21:03:59 It has nothing to do with left and right or black and white Ann.  It's so much more complex than that - only idiots think it's that simple.  A lot has to do with literally oil which few understand - Arabs and Jews didn't have a huge problem and arabs sold Jews a lot of the land
1602 2018-05-10 21:03:58 Just watched the doc. After spending hours trying to work out from labels which products have palm oil, would be helpful to know *which* UK supermarket has vowed to stop stocking it?
1603 2018-05-10 21:03:58 Your main complaint is gas going up?  Lol.  Of course it’s going to go up once Iran’s oil is restricted.  Mary, your priorities in life are seriously ass backwards.
1604 2018-05-10 21:03:57 Y’all I KNOW @AshleyBlaine smell like apricot and lavender oil, I just know she do 
1605 2018-05-10 21:03:57 You know their friends in the oil industry needed to recoup their losses from the low gas prices during the Obama administration. 
1606 2018-05-10 21:03:54 Does the Whitehouse also condemn palm oil barons in borneo murdering orangutans. #RedApe genocide!
1607 2018-05-10 21:03:52 Stored body fats may also contain high levels of toxins, so it's good to not cut your fat calories too much. Otherwise you may end up with a large amount of free radicals.

Also depends on the quality of the fats.. E.g. MCTs, coconut, avocado oil, etc.
1608 2018-05-10 21:03:51 I’ll tell you all now, baby oil and baby bubble bath will save your life. Stressed? Baby bubble bath&oil. Tired? BBBO. Grumpy? BBBO. Skins on fire from too much tanning? BBBO. Boys ain’t shit? BBBO
1609 2018-05-10 21:03:50 Thanks to those who protect our nation from those who hate us due to the morons in office starting wars over oil and money.
1610 2018-05-10 21:03:49 So you spin this as it’s about her heritage when you know she’s an oil and gas and mineral shill for ASRC.  You’re so dishonest .  Just be truthful about it.  She’s picked because of her tries to te oil and gas. Stop lying.
1611 2018-05-10 21:03:47 Trump is rewarding Putin for giving him the presidency. Oil price, next will be removal of sanctions.

We’re a stupid species who don’t deserve to have control of the only home there is to every single known living thing. 
1614 2018-05-10 21:03:21 @MugShotUK is it possible to remove the Palm Oil from your products please. I wont buy them. Theres no need to have it in there &  The devestation from palm oil is harrowing so please look into this many thanks! #palmoil #mugshots
1615 2018-05-10 21:03:18 People’s demand for palm oil is the problem. We all have a lot to answer for. People need to vote with their wallets.
1616 2018-05-10 21:03:14 Purchased beard oil, suspenders, dress socks, bow tie, and rye whiskey.

1617 2018-05-10 21:03:14 Higher oil and gas prices will spur shale oil recovery and fracking....good for petro seekers, bad for everyone else.
1618 2018-05-10 21:03:13 Watching @BBCTwo: Red Ape Saving the Orangutang. Heartbreaking to watch. As someone who loves animals, to see them being chased from felled trees and shot at by Farmers. All because Palm Oil producers are cutting down the rain forest. #savetherainforests #dontbuypalmoil 
1619 2018-05-10 21:03:09 No more palm oil.
1620 2018-05-10 21:02:55 Sports Massage Oil is the muscle oil in steriods. Because of customer feedback we had to launch a stronger version for muscle and point pain. A must try for sports fanatics and injuries.
1621 2018-05-10 21:02:54 Fact that it's Iran's oil money changes nothing.
1622 2018-05-10 21:02:54 @CadburyUK Can you confirm whether you use palm oil in your products? #palmoil #redape
1623 2018-05-10 21:02:49 im still a registered republican... no, they attacked in retaliation... why did he pull out? You think the answer is: he loves america? #1 It’s out of spite for Obama ; #2 possibility: this event just increased oil prices vastly, making Saudis and Russians billions instantly

1628 2018-05-10 21:02:37 My grandma was at my house for a total of 20 minutes and in that time she got an oil stain out of my dress and found me a matching necklace
1629 2018-05-10 21:02:29 it is the oil and travel too.
1630 2018-05-10 21:02:25 Heartbreaking watching the orangutans on BBC2 now in danger from Palm oil farms in Borneo. @OrangutansSOS @OrangutanFndn. Time to help these guys
1631 2018-05-10 21:02:20 It’s all about the quid pro quo to Putin. Trump couldn’t get the sanctions lifted like he told Putin he could, so he put rubles in the Kremlin’s pockets by pulling out of the Iran deal. It was widely known this would boost oil prices &, by extension, Putin’s/oligarchs’ net worth.
1632 2018-05-10 21:02:11 Dear Mr. President, you decision to exit Iran deal is very beneficial for Russia. Oil price is going up and Ruble is strengthening.
1633 2018-05-10 21:02:09 Na Oil worker bro
1634 2018-05-10 21:02:00 Completely agree, but I think most consumers have no clue about palm oil and whether it’s in the products they buy. It’s up to the UK’s major supermarkets to step up to the plate. @Tesco @asda @sainsburys @Morrisons @AldiUK @LidlUK
1635 2018-05-10 21:01:54 So much for homosapiens “the wiseman”. Clearly this is not. Again, it is in the gift of multinational companies to demand sustainable palm oil & say no more until we can guarantee legal and sustainable sources.
1636 2018-05-10 21:01:51 Really, how much oil does the US buy from Iran.
1637 2018-05-10 21:01:46 #RedApe a real eye opener. Disturbing and upsetting but we all need to get on board. Stop using Palm oil. Check EVERYTHING you buy for palm oil and just don't buy it.  It's as simple as that.
1638 2018-05-10 21:01:40 It's shocking how many products contain palm oil and it's so hard to avoid, even soda bread in some supermarkets has it.
1639 2018-05-10 21:01:37 #RedApe    Which supermarket said they would remove Palm oil products that were not sustainable sourced ???   Did I miss it ?
1640 2018-05-10 21:01:34 @NutellaGlobal do you have any plans to cut your use of palm oil?
1641 2018-05-10 21:01:33 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President tax plan you implemented for American people, is being attacked by the oil industry, taking it vantage of the fact that people may have extra money, and are raising Oil prices, please don’t let them do it

1643 2018-05-10 21:01:24 #RedApe has made me want to go and save the orangutans and avoid palm oil at all costs! Humans are so destructive :(
1644 2018-05-10 21:01:12 Hey West Virginia, you poor folks have been “snookered” by the orange snake oil salesmen! Don’t you all just hate that! In your next life learn critical thinking skills, they help! 

“All that glitters is not gold”!
1645 2018-05-10 21:01:09 No more palm oil until we can guarantee it comes from 100% sustainable resources #SaveTheRainforest #SaveTheOrangutan #Vgang
1646 2018-05-10 21:01:07 No more palm oil. Full stop. Horrible stuff. It's killing us & the planet.
1647 2018-05-10 21:00:57 U.S. Seen Cutting Oil Imports to Lowest Since Eisenhower
1648 2018-05-10 21:00:56 Orangutans- having acted on plastic bags, surely we can act on palm oil?  Surely most is used by a handful of big multinationals like @Unilever and @ProcterGamble - surely they can guarantee sustainability of sources?
1649 2018-05-10 21:00:55 Canceling the Iran Nuclear deal will raise oil prices and is a direct benefit to Russia. Bad for the world economy, bad for our economy. 

Expect to use your tax break to pay for higher fuel prices.
1650 2018-05-10 21:00:52 And oil.
1651 2018-05-10 21:00:50 That’s what happens when people buy into snake oil salesmen’s pitches
1652 2018-05-10 21:00:48 Watching it too Clare. Humans & our need for palm oil #redtape
1653 2018-05-10 21:00:39 Did you know that everyone has a different type of facial skin and that your face and its moisture and oil contents change day to day?

1656 2018-05-10 21:00:33 Please use your power as consumers to boycott palm oil. Ethical purchasing habits now for the rest of your life please everyone.  I have seen that deforestation with my actual eyes.
1657 2018-05-10 21:00:32 United States Oil Fund (USO) price at close, 2018-05-10, is 14.359.
1658 2018-05-10 21:00:30 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats
1659 2018-05-10 21:00:30 @USArmy platoon in the Edmonton Airport.... you here to steal our oil too?
1660 2018-05-10 21:00:26 Such a powerful show.  Which supermarket has pledged to eliminate palm oil?
1661 2018-05-10 21:00:25 Awww you’re awesome see, funny thing I live off essential oils- when I read this I read essential oil, then realized and smiled. You: Caring Beautiful Light Love- lots of it- you beautiful soul.
1662 2018-05-10 21:00:21 It was awful. I feel sick. I am never buying anything with Palm oil in again. Im off to complain to Cadbury's as dairy milk uses it and I won't eat it anymore.
1663 2018-05-10 21:00:20 you may use olive oil, and/or lemon instead; this sounds yummmy tho!
1664 2018-05-10 21:00:16 Stop buying Palm Oil... Safe the Orangutan
1665 2018-05-10 21:00:10 With or without the Oil Spill?
But feel free to keep on drilling.
1666 2018-05-10 21:00:09 Why aren't millennials buying oil stains?

1668 2018-05-10 21:00:05 Watching save the orangutan @BBC how do we get palm oil out of our lives @SirDavidBBC @ChrisGPackham surely green corridirs through plantations reconnecting rain forest etc. Fight the greed?
1669 2018-05-10 21:00:03 Hey @NutellaGlobal & @HeadandShoulder why don’t you use TOTALLY sustainable palm oil to ensure no damage to wildlife?
1670 2018-05-10 21:00:01 Watching BBC2 programme on Orangutan’s...heartbreaking! Why is the Human race so destructive! All for Palm oil and greed!

1672 2018-05-10 20:59:55 Companies and consumers should demand 100% sustainable palm oil.

1676 2018-05-10 20:59:42 No more Palm Oil until it comes from totally legal forests
1677 2018-05-10 20:59:42 No more palm oil please
1678 2018-05-10 20:59:40 Yeah those are typical ones and can help to orient in time and place when in flashbacks. Especially helpful is a strong smell - lavender oil
1679 2018-05-10 20:59:37 Me too! I would rub that oil so well.
1680 2018-05-10 20:59:37 I’m about to oil my body up and advertise my premium Snapchat.

1681 2018-05-10 20:59:30 Having visited one of the rescue centres in Borneo, it is awful to see so many orphaned Orangutan. All due to Human demand for Palm oil #RedApe
1682 2018-05-10 20:59:29 Agreed, so long as there are profits to be made in armaments and/or more than one country has oil ....!
1683 2018-05-10 20:59:29 Don’t buy any product with palm oil in it #save the orangutans
1684 2018-05-10 20:59:26 Watch bbc2. Stop buying products that contain palm oil. Use consumer power #nomorepalmoil #orangutans
1685 2018-05-10 20:59:24 Sick of watching virtue signalling rightwit drama queen hermits drone on about, well anything that lodges in their single cells ... you are the queen of virtue signalling, and all for clicks to the jones' snake oil bollox site ... well done you!
1686 2018-05-10 20:59:23 No your not, you’re not protecting anything but your job. I applaud you though, that oil has only been in the ground for millions of years and you’re off to a fast start!
1687 2018-05-10 20:59:22 Made an appointment with Natural Health Services to have a consultation about CBD oil on the 23rd. I think my therapist should be there too, she would know the right things to ask about, so I gotta make an appointment with her for the same morn'n.
1688 2018-05-10 20:59:16 #RedApe @NutellaGlobal  are very responsible for this impact on the environment by using palm oil...hence our boycott... they put £'s before 
1689 2018-05-10 20:59:10 What’s happened to the planet? This programme is so distressing.  Please do not buy products containing palm oil.
1690 2018-05-10 20:59:03 That was the plan.  Iranian oil caused a glut.  With sanctions,  russian oil will make huge profits.  Putin is a happy man.
1691 2018-05-10 20:59:02 Yeah, sure.  So DO NOT bomb it to pieces. For the oil. Thank you.
1692 2018-05-10 20:58:53 need oil
1693 2018-05-10 20:58:52 I don't know how people had twins before Amazon, though.  Not joking.  Maybe the cultural/social foundations for alternatives have atrophied.  Maybe they're there and we didn't know.  But boycotting Amazon would have been like boycotting big oil in a city with no public transit.
1694 2018-05-10 20:58:52 Watching these incredible creatures be shot, set on fire & their rainforest home razed to the ground for palm oil is pretty hard to watch. To know it is one thing, but to see it is another. Well done @johnsauven #RedApe
1695 2018-05-10 20:58:39 A drop of olive oil rubbed nightly into your nails will help them grow long and strong, and is cheaper than shop-bought manicure oils.

Do the right thing. Pretend your board have a conscience
1701 2018-05-10 20:58:14 My car ran out of oil and I’m stuck at Ralph’s. It won’t move?? Does anybody know what to do??
1702 2018-05-10 20:58:13 Now they decide on how much oil they sell MINUS the trade deals we had with Iran and the oil they parted with in them.
1703 2018-05-10 20:58:06 @FullMeasureNews @SharylAttkisson "Crude oil futures have leapt from $26 at the time of Trump’s election to $77 today." 
IRAN SANCTIONS raises oil prices DRAMATICALLY INCREASING THE PROFITS $$$ RUSSIA MAKES ON OIL SALES! Is Trump's gift to Putin being covered? Not all about Rudy
1704 2018-05-10 20:58:02 Massive thank you to Kennedy at @LushEdinburgh for the Jason and the Aragon Oil to try as an act of kindness. It made my day after spending it revising. Looking forward to giving it a try #KindnessMatters
1705 2018-05-10 20:58:00 If Enos doesn't get out here with that fuel oil shipment I may need to put solar panels up before the campers arrive
1706 2018-05-10 20:57:58 whats that? my hairdresser gave me rly good advice---never shampoo yr ends, only condition. and never shampoo more than twice per week. also after washing hair, put a mixture of conditioner (dime sized dollop) and hair oil into the ends of yr hair and leave it in
1707 2018-05-10 20:57:53 Those that use sustainable palm oil usually label their products with it
1708 2018-05-10 20:57:52 Never ever buy anything that contains Palm Oil. BBC2 now just highlights how corporative greed and our ignorance is funding the destruction of this planet and the extinction of beautiful species like orangutans. People must wake up and tell your families too
1709 2018-05-10 20:57:35 Gotta check my oil first!
1710 2018-05-10 20:57:28 How the hell are vegetable oils, canola oil, and sunflower oil still a thing tho?  Hurts my soul.
1711 2018-05-10 20:57:13 Most do sadly.  Look for sustainable palm oil in the ingredients list of products.
1712 2018-05-10 20:57:10 I picked up an ounce of og a gram of obama oil a gram of gg #4 oil a purple urkle cartridge and a gram of medicino breathe oil lmao love legalization !!!
1713 2018-05-10 20:57:07 Yes, 70s 80s was timber logging, big US Corps, latterly Palm oil, but the main perpetrators have imo, learned a lesson from before, how to hide their dirty work..#PalmOil is EVERYWHERE, who are the greedy bastards behind it ?

1716 2018-05-10 20:56:56 You cannot put into words the state of the situation in Borneo and Sumatra and how we are clearing the rainforests on an industrial scale. The destruction is unimaginable. And all for cheap oil and company profits #redape
1717 2018-05-10 20:56:55 Does it leave room for the 55 gallon drum of oil you will need?
1718 2018-05-10 20:56:54 Would 'orangutan friendly' labelling raise awareness of sustainable Palm oil? Or do we really care enough about our beautiful forests & #redape#SavingTheOrangutan
1719 2018-05-10 20:56:51 It also has an oil fund - Scots who voted against independence in the 1970s in the face of government deceit & project fear must regret what they have denied their grandchildren
1720 2018-05-10 20:56:49 When are you going to Buy Sustainable Palm Oil? #RedApe Save the Orangutan
1721 2018-05-10 20:56:47 It must be disappointing that Abramovich flew his oil bought chopper over our ground and released he was making a bad decision investing in yours. I understand your frustration 
1722 2018-05-10 20:56:33 An educated opinion on oil is like a fart in the wind. A 4-year old will give you the best insight. The commodity of oil has too many influences/factors to predict any price.
1723 2018-05-10 20:56:31 He's right that we need to move away from fossil fuel in areas that we can. Not all vehicles will be convertible, or planes for that matter, but we can save using oil for home heating and power generation so that we can save the world's oil reserves for what's absolutely needed.
1724 2018-05-10 20:56:29 I am pretty sick of getting friend requests from USA army oil tycoons that are actually pics of guess male models or actors lol I work in the entertainment industry you think I don't know who Boris Kodjoe is ahahahaha --Yona closes her eyes **Dreams if only**--
1725 2018-05-10 20:56:24 Gotta lift them sanctions and make that trillion dollar oil deal for them russian oligarchs and destabilize Iran and shut THEIR oil supply off to make fkn trillions more. His supporters are selling out their country for a tool. A putin tool.
1726 2018-05-10 20:56:20 Looks like a donut dripping in oil.

1728 2018-05-10 20:56:11 Don't do it! Gmc uses a complete loss oil system like the 1910 Harley! State of the art!
1729 2018-05-10 20:56:02 The EU has what should be an easy choice. Buy oil from Iran using eros. Or buy oil for the US using American dollars.
1730 2018-05-10 20:55:59 Water, Textured Wheat Protein, Coconut Oil, Potato Protein, Natural Flavors, 2% or less of: Leghemoglobin (Soy), Yeast Extract, Salt, Konjac Gum, Xanthan Gum, Soy Protein Isolate + vitamins
1731 2018-05-10 20:55:53 My dad has been here less than a day and already my car is fixed & washed, oil is changed, and gas tank is full. 
1732 2018-05-10 20:55:50  Billion?? He doesn’t have a billion. He never did. Have you not read anything? He borrowed over $400M two years before the election. That dude is a snake oil salesman
1733 2018-05-10 20:55:45 Absolutely. The price of oil is creeping up & the principal beneficiary is Russia. Trump kept his promise.
1734 2018-05-10 20:55:42 Russia doesn't care about Iran, they want to keep them from becoming globalized and joining the world economy. This helps Russia in many ways. 1) Naval base in Tartus, which is why they're fine with Israel attacking Iran, 2) Oil prices rise, 3) RU Aircraft Industry huge winners.
1735 2018-05-10 20:55:41 @ImSayingThough Happens to the best of us! Have you taken care of the oil change?
1736 2018-05-10 20:55:41 Had my S2 class today thinking about and justifying their decisions as to whether or not the mining and oil industries are good for Alaska #geography
1737 2018-05-10 20:55:30 Got off work early so time to wash my car & get an oil change
1738 2018-05-10 20:55:20 @realDonaldTrump  we are being soaked by the oil/gas industry..someone in that chain, pls look into why gas prices are slowly creeping to 4 dollars again...this great economy and this is what they do...?? thanks for your time sir.
1739 2018-05-10 20:55:18 "Jason and the argan oil" shampoo bar (love the smell) 
"new" (cinnamon) 
"soak and float" (soothing to my dry, achy scalp. [hair hurts when I move it]). 
And an old one they don't sell anymore I guess.
1740 2018-05-10 20:55:13 Fuck that palm oil 
1741 2018-05-10 20:55:07 Hahaha: President Trump is using “shenanigans” to raise oil prices to make shale production economic, Iran Oil Minister Zanganeh
1742 2018-05-10 20:54:52 On Tuesday morning, all the oil ran out in the Middle East. None left. On Wednesday, all the western powers packed their bags and got out. None left.
1743 2018-05-10 20:54:51 New desk is gonna be here on Saturday eeee~
Gotta go pick up compressed air, machine oil, and new huge mouse mat to prepare for it. Also figure out a way to get rid of the old desk and clean my room. Where's all the  big strong stallions when you need some work done.
1744 2018-05-10 20:54:47 Lack of freedom is having to check the oil constantly because gmc will not repair under warranty!
1745 2018-05-10 20:54:43 And then you must be OK with the hundreds of oil tankers in the Pacific in the Atlantic.  Would you say please, mind your own business.
1746 2018-05-10 20:54:42 Well it does oil the wheels!
1747 2018-05-10 20:54:42 Cheers - sadly Norway is decades ahead of us on the oil fund model. Other bits of the UK want to do there own thing too. Taken them too long to reform a land shaped by monarchy and privilege. Same story around Europe.
1748 2018-05-10 20:54:42 My true love drowned 
in a dirty old pan of oil
That did run from the block
Of a Falcon sedan 1969
The paper said '75
There were no survivors
None found alive

~Neko Case, Star Witness
1749 2018-05-10 20:54:41 if there were NO oil spills I might agree... oceans poisoned = shrimp poisoned.  U know it.
1750 2018-05-10 20:54:40 You have no right, absolutely no right to be interfering in Canadian matters. Leave our oil allowed!
1751 2018-05-10 20:54:38 I cant believe what we are doing to this planet Borneo is being raped to fuck by loggers and palm oil adventurists..Orangutans are being caught up in it. We are a total disgrace as animals , we have failed as gurdians of the planet #RedApe
1752 2018-05-10 20:54:29 @Nestle @PepsiCo enhancing quality of life? By destroyingg our planet for palm oil. You are a DISGRACE.
Money over everything, shame on you
1753 2018-05-10 20:54:19 WM ambulance service came&kindly confirmed I wasn’t having a stroke. So I would be thankful if people didnt suggest cannabis oil to me 
1754 2018-05-10 20:54:13 Phil looks like he is changing oil or delivering mail for a living
1755 2018-05-10 20:54:07 Again I agree. Especially more recent wars have been more about oil than they have freedom. But I do believe we would have lost our freedom if Nazi Germany had won and that’s the point I think Ricky was trying to get across.
1756 2018-05-10 20:54:07 Many things are intertwined. Sanctions on Iranian gas for example means that the marketplace for their  oil becomes smaller which means that the country gets much less revenue which ultimately translates to misery and poverty for the people at the bottom of the chain.
1757 2018-05-10 20:53:55 Dave, it is 2018… no one smokes real flower anymore <artisian_flavored_pure_distillate_cannabis_oil_vape.gif>
1758 2018-05-10 20:53:46 Has anyone else's hair gone SO dry from this weather or is it just mine? I've just smothered loads of kitoko oil on it and it's perfect again ugh
1759 2018-05-10 20:53:45 @holisticannabis 
Thanks for the follow. I have an inoperable brain tumour and cbd oil really helps
1760 2018-05-10 20:53:44 Complete loss oil system? Ingenious like a 1910 Harley Davidson! I will never buy gmc product again.
1761 2018-05-10 20:53:34 How many oil companies is he connected to now?
1762 2018-05-10 20:53:25 It is disgusting stuff too. I have some palm oil free toothpaste on its way - see what that is like
1763 2018-05-10 20:53:18 Yes 3 mugs flour 2 mugs salt  1 mug water and a splash of oil is what I did tonight. Made 4 balls
1764 2018-05-10 20:53:16 Golan Heights = oil and gas reserves QED
1765 2018-05-10 20:53:07 Silly dotes it’s the puppet master pulling Trumps strings Russia needs high oil prices it’s their biggest export the party of family values fiscal responsibility and evangelicals are clueless as well as their supporters. Duh
1766 2018-05-10 20:53:04 Sounds like a much better plan than the vegetable oil one that was touted years back - that would only really decompose in a dedicated composting program and thus was pointless for reducing litter.
1767 2018-05-10 20:53:01 Not just Putie, but all of Dotard's oil and gas buddies here in the USA.  Guaranteed Mueller will find the vig paid on the side to Dotard and his Klan through a series of LLCs, as a thank you for stirring up some turmoil to hike oil prices.
1768 2018-05-10 20:52:43 3-I showed u Scotland's revenue now includes a geographical share of oil revenue. You denied it saying "Barnett doesn't cover it". You are wrong as proved by the screenshot I sent you.

1-Nonsense-it still requires huge development before being profitable. How would iScot do it?
1769 2018-05-10 20:52:38 Norway's North Sea Oil bonanza was invested in it's people. UK's oil bonanza now sits in off-shore bank accounts. That's the difference, my friends between capitalism and social democracy. Come on everyone! Let's give it a go!
1770 2018-05-10 20:52:34 Congress couldn't stop him from bombing Syria the UN couldn't stop him from putting the US embassy to Israel in Jerusalem, if trump wants a war with Iran which we know he does no one can stop this dictator trump...he is oil hungry and Bolton is war hungry bad combination for Iran
1771 2018-05-10 20:52:26 I think it's all the big ones like @Nestle @Unilever they all use palm oil and not usually sustainable
1772 2018-05-10 20:52:26 Apart from the wonderful work being done by the rescue squads, I’m finding this very difficult to watch. Palm oil and anyone involved in its production should be totally shunned. Why do they need to wipe out rainforest to grow bloody palm trees anyway...?? #RedApe
1773 2018-05-10 20:52:15 You do realize that we’re not the only country that consumes oil, right?
1774 2018-05-10 20:52:14 Watching Red Ape:Saving the Orangutan on BBC 2. It’s so horrible and sad! All for the sake of Palm Oil. Humans are locust
1775 2018-05-10 20:52:10 CO2 Oil for $9.00/gram after tax. Come check out the Lemon Kush by Myriad Nectars.
1776 2018-05-10 20:51:58 #RedApe I will be looking at the ingredients panel on everything, for animal products and palm oil #vegan #ORANGUTANS
1777 2018-05-10 20:51:55 Mission accomplished! 
RT @McFaul: Days after Trump leaves Iran nuclear deal , oil prices are rising and ruble is strengthening.
1778 2018-05-10 20:51:51 Al Gore prefers to heat his homes and fly his private jets with blood oil.
1779 2018-05-10 20:51:21 It’s not just a case of removing palm oil, it’s educating people and making them understand. It’s often a hidden ingredient, can be labelled as veg oil. It’s the Indonesian government that needs to listen too. Very complex situation horrific for orangutans
1780 2018-05-10 20:51:14 Farris soaking his whole face in castor oil yes
1781 2018-05-10 20:51:08 Mind blown i just thought start high work it to the frying oil after 2 days haha
1782 2018-05-10 20:51:07 Oil is the 4 movie.
1783 2018-05-10 20:50:54 I don’t know how anyone takes CBD oil, I had some, woke up off my tits, screaming I was having a stroke&made my boyfriend call the ambulance
1784 2018-05-10 20:50:47 It looks like there's going to be a war between Iran and Israel.  It's certainly heating up in that direction, but to what end?  Things could get really ugly soon.  This could be the cause of the next recession.  Another oil shock.  Causes a recession every time.
1785 2018-05-10 20:50:44 #RedApe which companies use unsustainable palm oil?
1786 2018-05-10 20:50:43 The only thing Houston has over Calgary IMO is more Traffic/ Congestion, Urban Sprawl & a few more Oil & Gas Companies, overall Calgary superior IMO, & we do have that New Mega Asian Mall New Horizon Mall that has over 500 Stores so it's officially the new biggest! 
1787 2018-05-10 20:50:25 War mongers thrive so killing for land and oil,rights
 Trump wants oil. He would be stealing it and Israel,want more and more land. is real wants to rule the Middle East.
Middle East, is in a turmoil and if we  take out the leaders so its will create MORE MORE NOT LESS TERRIOR.
1788 2018-05-10 20:50:23 @BBCEarth it might not be much but I’m going to change the way I shop big time after watching the Orangutan documentary.Its horrific what we do as humans and how blinkered we live our lives sometimes,feel ashamed right now that I’m not more aware of impact of Palm Oil 
1789 2018-05-10 20:50:17 He's exactly right. But he didn't get his higher gas prices, because the market/supply/demand drives those prices. Now that Iran will be out of the picture the prices will rise. Putin will get more for his oil, and the US will ramp up offshore drilling and fracking. Lovely!
1790 2018-05-10 20:50:08 #RedApe can companies be made to declare whether their palm oil ingredient is sustainable?
1791 2018-05-10 20:50:02 When did a oil change start costing $50????
1792 2018-05-10 20:50:01 Yeah they do, but I just use Cetaphil Oil Removal Foam Wash and Moisturizer with SPF 30 in it. Because you have to wear a sunscreen everyday.
1793 2018-05-10 20:50:00 Something needs to be done abt this palm oil issue. Devastating!
1794 2018-05-10 20:49:56 Examples of this strategy are common, having normally
been implemented by huge corporations with commodities they operate their
core businesses on. The textbook examples of this are De Beers and the global
diamond supply, or Standard Oil and the US oil supply. #OptiToken
1795 2018-05-10 20:49:51 Changed my car oil myself for the first time. I'm getting better at things.
1796 2018-05-10 20:49:46 The impact a programme of this sort carves like a knife on the soul, and serves as a permanent reminder to NEVER, EVER, buy anything containing palm oil.  I am positively #AshamedToBeHuman when we can do this to our cousins.. #RedApe
1797 2018-05-10 20:49:46 Find plantain (the plant outside by your sidewalk...NOT the banana-looking plantain). Roll the leaf back and forth over the bite (s) until it releases the oil/juice. Let dry and enjoy some relief from itching and inflammation. Works awesome for wasp/bee stings, too.
1798 2018-05-10 20:49:33 Solar cell efficiency alone is a worthless metric to judge performance of a solar panel. You need to factor in the cost to produce said panel. And the fact is in 2018 we can produce energy far cheaper with solar than with oil or gas.
1799 2018-05-10 20:49:29 I loved the Chili bowl win when you jumped in Bryan Clauson arms. #special
1800 2018-05-10 20:49:23 This will limit oil growth as explained by ETP as a continuation to NG handling. NGL handling is another issue. 

"With gases shut in, of course oil will be impacted as well, because a lot of the gas is flowing just to produce the oil."
1801 2018-05-10 20:49:16 Jim, ask the folks in Elkhart what $100 a barrel of oil will do to the RV industry and how the pullout of the Iran deal might help drive the cost there.  Last time it happened, the region was hit hard.

Please remember that #Vascepa is not #fishoil.  You are
confusing the consumer and others.  Look up the patent for ethyl ester of EPA and you will discover that it is not #fishoil.  It is made from fish oil.  Don't defame our good name #FishOil
1803 2018-05-10 20:49:11 Oil  has taken off like a rocket as Israel strikes Iranian targets in Syria  in response to rocket fire overnight. Israel says it targeted Iran’s  military infrastructure in Syria, in response to an Iranian rocket  attack on the occupied Golan Heights.

1806 2018-05-10 20:48:58 We ran into you at the Holiday Inn a couple weeks ago in our hometown . Southern Illinois!
1807 2018-05-10 20:48:49 What Reagan did to drive the price of oil down to bankrupt the Soviet Union was not a conservative accomplishment. It destroyed the oil and gas industry for at least a decade, maybe longer. Reagan was more lucky than Conservative that he could hold his stare longer than Gorbachev
1808 2018-05-10 20:48:46 Send oil now Abdullamatt !
1809 2018-05-10 20:48:45 Evening primrose oil and vitamin B6 is amazing for depression and anxiety I would strongly recommend if you suffer from anxiety and depression 
1810 2018-05-10 20:48:45 It's wild bc there's a family fighting for cbd oil as a medicine for their epileptic son. It's the only thing that works for him and the courts want to take him away bc his parents are using it instead of the harsh ass medicine the doctors prescribed.
1811 2018-05-10 20:48:45 Oil money wants to sleep 
1812 2018-05-10 20:48:45 #RedApe is very hard to watch as the damage being done by humans is criminal, just for timber and now palm oil, ban the f***ing stuff and save our cousins
1813 2018-05-10 20:48:42 To say I am ashamed to be a human is an understatement. Deforestation must stop and  Palm Oil is to blame.  #Naturalworld #redape Completely broken me tonight :(
1814 2018-05-10 20:48:41 To have an even bigger victory redux over the oil price by squaring off a heavy hit after their investment is in place, just get ready for it
1815 2018-05-10 20:48:38 If you use a moisturiser it needs to be water based, not oil based ;)
1816 2018-05-10 20:48:32 It’s not about cowardness it’s about US public is bamboozled Defence contractors companies and oil corporations making profit out of it
1817 2018-05-10 20:48:26 Then that's the rising price of oil. That dollar fifty tax cut is not going to go far.
1818 2018-05-10 20:48:20 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.
1819 2018-05-10 20:48:20 I don't feel that Yautja would find human's sexually attractive

2. Pink to dark brown oil skin with tiny hairs
3. Face closed over with skin
1820 2018-05-10 20:48:18 Please watch on ‘catch up’ or iplayer ..... this is devastating deforestation for the orangutan population - all for palm oil greed
1821 2018-05-10 20:48:14 “Here in Forest Gate, the local community is being terrorised by gangs on fixies, fuelled by Beavertown Neck Oil” 
1822 2018-05-10 20:48:13 Grosse partouze chez oil alors !
1823 2018-05-10 20:48:06 Is anyone else watching #RedApe on @BBCTwo and feeling a sense of shame and sadness for being human, the race that appears to be destroying rainforests for palm oil at the expense of orangutans and other species 
1824 2018-05-10 20:47:53 Hi, tar sand is derogatory and not correct term. I would not use derogatory term to describe your choices, so please show respect for Albertans right to work in the oil industry. Thx.
1825 2018-05-10 20:47:41 It doesnt take that long to do an oil change
1826 2018-05-10 20:47:33 #RedApe #SavingTheOrangutan on @BBCTwo is absoloutely devestating. We must find a better alternative to Palm oil so these beautiful creatures have a chance to survive. Wonderful to see all the people who are helping.
1827 2018-05-10 20:47:32 Doesn’t it make you wonder why we deserve to be here? We destroy their habit for our on selfish needs all because we think we need palm oil with no regard to the divesting consequences to wildlife.
1828 2018-05-10 20:47:27 What motors they had were powered with oil from the Soviet Union
1829 2018-05-10 20:47:27 I spent some time in Borneo at Sepilok and the scale of the Palm plantations is staggering. Row after row after perfect row of Palms with nothing else growing. Why on earth do we need so much palm oil?! 
1830 2018-05-10 20:47:27 Should cannabis oil be legally  available for cancer patients for pain management and other benefits?

1833 2018-05-10 20:47:10 Thanks to rumps stupid stand on Iran...he wants oil prices higher for his rich friends and needs to inflate the dollar due to his high National debt.  If we end up in a shooting war it will be for big oil companies. Don’t join the military.
1834 2018-05-10 20:46:56 Tum log khate ho beef par knowledge rakhte ho    goat jaisa..!7th century m Arabian ata tha khajur bechne ke liye..kya kare tab toh oil v nhi the na!!vo v Indus ke ush par..!par v kaise kare tab toh mullahs ko koi dekh le toh v ganga nah-na padta tha!!
1835 2018-05-10 20:46:55 meanwhile Joe friday is approx 69 contracts deep into his oil short swing
1836 2018-05-10 20:46:41 1) the only reason renewables would be a drain is the faults with the grid system
2) Apologies if i said the data u gave me was from 2013 
3) U certainly haven't proven Scotland doesn't get "geographical" share of oil etc
What does that even mean?
1837 2018-05-10 20:46:40 Cbd oil is now illegal in Wisconsin?? What a god damn joke
1838 2018-05-10 20:46:33 They use peanut oil to fry their chicken.
1839 2018-05-10 20:46:32 Heart black like oil so I recognize you slick niggas
1840 2018-05-10 20:46:30 Depends on the issue I think. So a solar companies PR agency changing people's minds on climate change is okay. An oil co doing the same in reverse possibly less so.
1841 2018-05-10 20:46:28 Watching Red Ape: Saving The Orangutan on BBC 2. Sad to see the damage that Palm Oil production is having on the Borneo Forest and the wildlife that depend on it. Thankfully there are people who are helping on ground level and saving the lives of many effected Orangutans.
1842 2018-05-10 20:46:27 Ban all the drivers, let Vettel drive alone! He'll be a happy kid...
1843 2018-05-10 20:46:17 Can't believe after years of trying to scrub off old fake tan, The trick all along is baby oil!! rub baby oil all over you n leave on for 30 mins or more then rub away in shower with a flannel and it comes off like a dream, RT to save a life x
1844 2018-05-10 20:45:56 You bet I am! And one who’s not completely useless! I know how to do my own oil changes and everything 
1845 2018-05-10 20:45:56 Is there a good comprehensive list of regular products that use palm oil? #saynotopalmoil #redape
1846 2018-05-10 20:45:55 Palm oil can fuck off.
1847 2018-05-10 20:45:53 also isn't it just a little insulting when people set out to do something with a specific technique and some yahoo goes "hey but why didn't you employ this other thing" No one looks at an oil painting and says it'd be better in acrylic.
1848 2018-05-10 20:45:53 .@goop can coconut oil fix my marriage? 
1849 2018-05-10 20:45:52 Brain function has been on overdrive as of late. Need an oil change.

1851 2018-05-10 20:45:43 A1. I make killer yogurt bagels in my oil less fryer #AllThatRazz
1852 2018-05-10 20:45:38 sounds similar to what I hear on $SN which is also heavily levered to oil
1853 2018-05-10 20:45:32 Just finish getting an oil change
1854 2018-05-10 20:45:22 It's all poison hun. So there shouldn't be any confusion. Yes cancer and SHORT term use after a surgery but I'm even sceptical about that. It made my nerves freak out so bad I can hardly walk after stopping. Poison! CBD oil helps.
1855 2018-05-10 20:45:22 This could be part of the bargain trump struck with Putin to get him elected. Putin needs it, trump likes big oil, and the people don’t matter. Perfect!
1856 2018-05-10 20:45:19 Venezuela not only dependent on oil (fiscal b/even @ $117!) but also not producing as much as before
1857 2018-05-10 20:45:16 I live literally 5 minutes away from a B&O rail yard. Got a big NG pipeline operation set up right next to it too. Trucks running day & night. Probably a good thing since oil is up to a 3 1/2 year high and climbing..

1869 2018-05-10 20:43:51 The rate of deforestation for #PalmOil is obscene! 1/3 of the remaining orangutan population could be wiped out by 2020.
We must push palm oil producers to farm 'sustainably', if we want to ensure the survival of Orangutans and many other species. #RedApe 
1870 2018-05-10 20:43:50 I want to know the names of all the companies who buy palm oil from these areas so I can boycott their products.  #RedApe
1871 2018-05-10 20:43:49 Iceland I believe. Aldi do a palm oil friendly version of Nutella which is decent  I've visited Sumatra and seen the devastation first hand. Its awful! And most people have no idea they are buying products containing it

1880 2018-05-10 20:43:17 Probably not but I've have to look more closely at it. It's a seed oil.
1881 2018-05-10 20:43:15 Iran can blockade the Straits of Hormuz and cut off the Persian Gulf and all that Iraqi oil from getting to the West. It'll take large naval force to keep it open. Which will come under attack itself. Ships sunk in straits might plug it up completely. West and Israel are fools.

1884 2018-05-10 20:43:06 Great story by @WarrenBuffett about his investment in the Delta Duck Club at the 1995 Annual Meeting, afternoon session, 1:14:00 minutes in. $29,000 share price, $20,000 cash, $7,000 in earnings from oil royalties.

1885 2018-05-10 20:43:04 I have the urge to fuckin squeegee the oil out of my hair idk how it gets like this so quickly but it's probably my fault
1886 2018-05-10 20:43:04 I wanna start oil painting again but they'll all just complain bout the smell of turpentine 
1887 2018-05-10 20:43:03 Forcing myself to watch #RedApe through tears. After 2 years living in Borneo I know how real this is. Stop using palm oil or they'll be gone forever very soon.  #endpalmoil
1888 2018-05-10 20:42:57 Has more to do with economics. Our allies in the Middle East decide how much oil they sell.
1889 2018-05-10 20:42:54 Water is the new oil: many wars will be fought over it the next decades in the Middle East!
1890 2018-05-10 20:42:53 #RedApe is heartbreaking  at least there are people trying to save them. But companies need to do more to remove palm oil from products so we can all help
1891 2018-05-10 20:42:53 These poor animals that share our DNA are almost extinct. Palm oil has a lot to answer for!
1892 2018-05-10 20:42:49 Tears streaming down my face watching this. I will never buy anything containing palm oil again. This is devastating. #SavingTheOrangutan
1893 2018-05-10 20:42:47 Detangled my hair after a shower. I'm exhausted and light headed. I'll put oil on my hair later because right now imma lay down so I don't pass out. #spoonie
1894 2018-05-10 20:42:44 Was in Borneo Years ago and palm oil was a major issue then. I cannot believe we've allowed things to get so bad. We need to save the #redape before it's too late.  Major corporations need to sort this palm oil out just like the debate around plastic; we are killing this planet.
1895 2018-05-10 20:42:40 Everyone don't agree with orders coming from a spoiled hair implanted white Supremacist.. People needs gas and oil, and fortunately Persia have both of them.. That's mainly the reason why your zionist mentor want to invade Persia.
1896 2018-05-10 20:42:27 This is terribly distressing footage, hope all you palm oil product lovers can see this!!! #RedApe
1897 2018-05-10 20:42:21 I've said it before, UK companies should boycott #PalmOil & use British rapeseed oil instead. A win-win for the #rainforest , the #orangutans & UK farmers alike #RedApe @IAR_updates @BBCEarth

1902 2018-05-10 20:42:13 Watching #RedApe and am absolutely horrified by the destruction cased by palm oil
1903 2018-05-10 20:42:10 Distressing images of Borneo rainforest being clear felled for Palm oil production, destroying the habitat of the Orangutan.

1906 2018-05-10 20:41:38 They've been predicting we'll run out of oil in a few years since Rockefeller sank his first well. Human ingenuity will never run out but it has to be free or it can't work.Centrally planned economies always fail eventually. The separation of state and the economy is what we need

1908 2018-05-10 20:41:30 #redape holy crap, so in Borneo they deliberately fell all the rainforest trees just to replant with palm oil ones that can't sustain the animals that live there? That's just sick. 
1909 2018-05-10 20:41:22 So oil was $55 when Trump took office and now $77 per barrel, thanks Trump your policies are rewarding Iran and Venezuela and many others, there goes the #Taxcut to foreigners

1913 2018-05-10 20:41:05 #Israel is doubling down with "pictures" of "Iranian rockets" since nobody believed his #WagTheDog #GulfOfTonkin2018 announcement.

Why do you think Iran is going to suddenly do something they never did?

How are you profiting from the resulting oil market turmoil, @netanyahu?
1914 2018-05-10 20:41:01 This. I’ve been a partner in an oil company for 4 years now and the global market will certainly adjust to this. People don’t realize just how “global” the market is. There is *easily* enough capacity to cover any shortfalls due to Iran. It will sort itself out soon.
1915 2018-05-10 20:40:58 #GinaHaspel is a sister-in-torture of Dick Cheney. Even at his old age, Cheney, whose Iraqi War For Oil led 5000 innocent American soldiers and over 100 000 innocent Iraqis to their early death, n destabilized the Middle East, remains unrepentant.

1918 2018-05-10 20:40:49 #RedApe doing a great job on BBC 2 of showing the effects of palm oil. Hopefully this exposure will get people to think about what goes into their foods and what supporting these products does to those that we share this planet with. Cut palm oil from your diet. #PalmOil
1919 2018-05-10 20:40:36 Which supermarket has committed to eliminating palm oil?
1920 2018-05-10 20:40:33 We know that your oil drilling guidelines were reviewed by industry. Which medical professionals, if any, assisted writing the drilling regulations you claim to be protective? @CDPHE @denverpost @dailycamera @NationalNurses @nytimes @MattJonesCO #copolitics @boulderweekly

1922 2018-05-10 20:40:19 Oil equities are a different story - institutions underweight and they are cheap relative to strip - disconnect between stocks and oil has been extreme - that gap needs to be bridged somehow - I think short the commodity and long the equities makes some sense

I know this may come as a shock to some people but we are allowed different opinions on stuff. Just saying.
1928 2018-05-10 20:39:46 Like you broke the rig that spilled trillions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico?
1929 2018-05-10 20:39:43 This documentary about Orangutans on @BBCTwo is beautiful and heartbreaking at the same time. If there was ever a good reason not to consume palm oil, this is it...
1930 2018-05-10 20:39:40 Dear YL oil distributors...stop trying to sell me on your damn oils by saying they are better then all others. They are not. Therapeutic grade oils are the same! Now leave me alone for the love of God! Ps...are you certified in aromatherapy? Yeah didn't think so. #donttalktome

1941 2018-05-10 20:39:05 #RedApe heartbreaking.  Do NOT buy anything with palm oil in it.
1942 2018-05-10 20:38:58 45 could give two shits about peace/safety. Clearly all he wanted was to a) undo an Obama achievement and b) help putin tamper with world oil mkts in order for both to make bank along with their greedy co-conspirators

1944 2018-05-10 20:38:56 Putin Thanks DJT for pulling out of the Iran deal as the increase of oil prices benefits Russia big time.
1945 2018-05-10 20:38:55 The problem is that windmills and solar will NEVER serve that purpose.  We can’t abandon our oil interests until we have something that truly scales out, and liberals fight nuclear tooth and nail.
1946 2018-05-10 20:38:43 Trump is rolling back regulations on clean air & water. He's opening up 47 areas along our nations coastlines for oil & gas drilling, destroying tourism and marine life, He has no honor, no integrity, no decency, no ethics and no respect for the rule of law. That's enough for me.

It is easy to say we want deforestation to stop - while sitting on our real wood couch, in a house with a heavy real wood door in the entrance, reading today's newspaper and enjoying the morning breakfast cooked in palm oil.

1973 2018-05-10 20:36:19 It is a reason for oil's rise- the US may (as it alluded to) punish nations who don't follow our sanctions, making it likely that there will be a net reduction in oil available for the global market.

1977 2018-05-10 20:35:41 The rise is due to oil speculators. We get very little oil from Iran. Matter of fact nobody should be buying oil from Iran the leading exporter of terrorism.

1979 2018-05-10 20:35:23 The bigger point here is to realize despite Trump's #EnergyDominance strategy the #US is dependent on the #Saudi relationship for energy market stability. In short, even if the US becomes a net exporter of oil, it still cares about global oil market stability and won't shun #KSA.

1989 2018-05-10 20:34:09 Something about looking up flourless cake recipes makes me want to drink motor oil.
1990 2018-05-10 20:34:06 Hi Donald. Yes, on starters our asparagus can be cooked with oil instead of butter and we’ve recently introduced grilled beetroot & sweet potato, smoked aubergine, roast pepper, pine nut & watercress. We’re planning to improve our vegan offering throughout the summer.
1991 2018-05-10 20:33:55 It really bothers me that an amazing bottle of olive oil in Spain is $8 and a piece of shit bottle from Whole Foods is $10.
1992 2018-05-10 20:33:53 The one good thing is rising oil prices may finally get people to stop driving SUVs when they're hauling neither cargo nor passengers.
1993 2018-05-10 20:33:48 Try some clove oil
1994 2018-05-10 20:33:37 This is basic disposable marijuana oil cartridge humor. 0/10 comedians voted it the fastest growing comedy genre of 2016, get with the program
1995 2018-05-10 20:33:35 They're already doing tests in the everglades looking for oil, this warning will fall on deaf ears
1996 2018-05-10 20:33:35 #Venezuelan president highly likely to be re-elected despite international opposition and increasing likelihood of #oil #sanctions.
1997 2018-05-10 20:33:23 Literally: to sell oil
1998 2018-05-10 20:33:20 You said that the Americans are selfish for pulling out of the deal. Lol. It's the European that are in it for trade and oil.They want to bring back the trades levels that existed prior to the sanctions on Iran.U.S is acting on principle for global security. EU in it 4 gold
1999 2018-05-10 20:33:14 Daily joke, Canada w 3rd largest reserves, chooses to import OPEC oil and remain captive supplier to US.
2000 2018-05-10 20:33:06 I know they were on the ground. As a matter of fact, I know none of them were even there at the time of the bombing. It was all a ploy. 

Meanwhile, now that Trump has left the Iran nuclear deal, oil prices are on the rise and the ruble is strengthening.
2001 2018-05-10 20:33:04 It really is awesome!

We're excited that the housing operators for these resilient tenants will be able to use thousands of dollars of revenue a year to improve services.

And we look forward to the day when #solar replaces oil drilling for good in areas like this one.

2005 2018-05-10 20:32:44 Thank u Arábia oil money
2006 2018-05-10 20:32:43 #FireFriedman is a despicable snake oil salesman. Putrid personage of the @GuggenheimPtnrs mandate. His obvious stranglehold over Roberts, as this team DOESN'T DO ANYTHING that promotes offensive STRATEGY.
2007 2018-05-10 20:32:40 After breaking an American treaty with all our allies, so Putin will gain millions in oil revenues, Trump should never be considered for anything but traitor.
2008 2018-05-10 20:32:37 YESS MY PIERCING WAS PAINFUL! And I use tea tree oil as well if used consistently it does help! Mine goes away and get me super little then it always comes back 
2009 2018-05-10 20:32:23 Yeah...oil is up 50 cents a gallon already
2010 2018-05-10 20:32:21 They will continue to look for the projects the way they are looking for oil in the north yet they will not see.
2011 2018-05-10 20:32:20 for a bit of crunch and sourness I added chopped caper berries - whole thing worked very well (just trying to clear excess herbs from fridge and use up tired potatoes) - tossed everything in a couple tsp of olive oil and some sea salt/pepper
2012 2018-05-10 20:32:16 but like do y’all think my brother will go get an oil change for me??? lol
2013 2018-05-10 20:32:15 Highest correlation to presidential approval is gas prices - trump obsessed with approval - he doesn’t want higher oil
2014 2018-05-10 20:32:13 “What they call flexibility I would call loopholes big enough to drive an oil tanker through”. So great!

2016 2018-05-10 20:31:56 I made it four (4) mins early to this oil change appt today and I haven’t been early for any appt at all in the past like 3 years this is WILD! I’d say it’s bc it was 7 mins from me but I’ve been 15 mins late to some closer to me :(
2017 2018-05-10 20:31:46 Iran is about oil and assets. Russia is about oil and assets.

2018 2018-05-10 20:31:43 They have known this for 16 months. 
Strategic patience doctrine of last admin. Not this one. Trump says he's going to do something, believe
2019 2018-05-10 20:31:39 Every once in a while you've got to put some oil on someone's face
2020 2018-05-10 20:31:34 Seems obvious trump struck a deal with Saudi before pulling out of the Iran deal - recall the opec tweet he sent and then Saudi’s press release - not saying we are at a top but sure feels like extreme optimism when my non financial friends are saying oil is going to 100
2021 2018-05-10 20:31:29 Will they stop using palm oil?
2022 2018-05-10 20:31:19 Russian oil prices rising, ruble strengthening today in response. But, no collusion
2023 2018-05-10 20:31:14 Is it bad that I'm deciding which olive oil to pick based on the label? #designteacherproblems
2024 2018-05-10 20:31:14 I wrote a feature about palm oil several years ago and have been trying my very best to avoid it ever since. I've stopped drinking fizzy drinks (all made by @PepsiCo etc) only use palm oil free toiletries (@superdrug and @LushLtd) and only eat chocolate that doesn't use palm oil.
2025 2018-05-10 20:31:06 Face tattoos are not cool.
2026 2018-05-10 20:31:02 Just a reminder that Trump is not normal and what’s occurring in the White House is not normal.     He’s a snake oil sociopath who uses scotch tape instead of a tie clip. 
2027 2018-05-10 20:30:55 Yes! I’ve got a couple of really good ones. I’ll pass them on tomorrow... Coconut oil is a perfect substitute... hate veg oils and yucky marge should be outlawed! If you don’t want the coconut flavour, use the flavourless oils.
2028 2018-05-10 20:30:52 hell no . no way he has even pushed world towards a new war in middle east and raised oil prices.
2029 2018-05-10 20:30:47 Oil companies had (with US help) been gutting Iran's oil since 1953, when Op Ajax killed an Iranian to install The Shah. It wasn't until 1979 that Iranian students occupied the US embassy and demanded The US leave. History, win the peace NOW!

2057 2018-05-10 20:26:15 It might not be the healthiest, but it's good to add if you fry off some chicken in some really shallow oil, boil off a little bit of rice and pop in one of those cheesy 'healthy living' korma sauces (or make your own) you get a nice korma - not a single grain of salt needed :)
2058 2018-05-10 20:26:04 Nope. This is old timey knowledge from when people were freaking out about fracking, then freaking out about how it was affecting oil markets, then freaking out when it went quiet as OPEC dumped supply on the market.
2059 2018-05-10 20:26:03 A new fight has broke out just day later - and guess what kids- oil /gas prices are going to go up up up !

2061 2018-05-10 20:25:52 You are utterly clueless on how the oil sands are developed.  in the 70's when this technology was first developed we did not burn the amount of carbon you are claiming here.

2076 2018-05-10 20:24:34 Olive oil makes everything better.
2077 2018-05-10 20:24:28 Because the Russians care more about oil prices, and sanctions on Iranian oil potentially lowers the world's supply of oil, thereby increasing Russia's profits.

2090 2018-05-10 20:23:27 Still waiting on the Saudi pledge to increase production to offset embargoed Iranian oil.  Still waiting.  Not likely.
2091 2018-05-10 20:23:17 ugh headache, not sure if it's because of oil painting
2092 2018-05-10 20:23:16 Those Iranians have oil.....if we take theirs....

Guess what's coming?
2093 2018-05-10 20:23:14 Indeed, ALL the Anglo & Northern European social democracies are rentier states—deriving rents from US military protection, commercial advantage, land ownership, natural resources (mining/oil/agro), white supremacy, preferential relations to finance & money (US or European).
2094 2018-05-10 20:23:08 And the winner in this dirty deal break is: Russia. Oil prices are now surging and Putin are delighted.
2095 2018-05-10 20:23:04 And they say Sean Dyche for manager of the year!!! 

No doubt someone will say money, oil etc....
2096 2018-05-10 20:23:01 On the flip side....due to higher oil prices ..... oilfield jobs are coming back!!!

2098 2018-05-10 20:22:57 Oil above $60 Lot of Shale will come online. Any spike is temporary.
Saudi is resigned to Shale dominance.
Iran wants it at $60 to keep US players from dictating the price.
2099 2018-05-10 20:22:57 Hi , u mean the clown news networks they report like clowns and the work at the circus, I consider them comedy channels, oh we must talk bout GAS, GIVE A TAX CUT TO PAY MORE FOR GAS PRICES FOR NO DAM REASON WE do not get oil from Iran just  excuse for big shots  raise shit

2105 2018-05-10 20:21:56 All energy companies gain, but Russia & Venezuela economies are extremely dependent on oil revenue. Russia doesn't have many other lucrative industries for hard dollars. Now with very high oil prices they'll have much more funds to cause problems in the world. Thanks to Trump!
2106 2018-05-10 20:21:48 you know it’s hot when the coconut oil is all melted
2107 2018-05-10 20:21:42 You do seem like a sentient oil painting sometimes.
2108 2018-05-10 20:21:33 i have no idea tbh, it looks like it slipped on a banana so hm... probably spilled oil on road?
2109 2018-05-10 20:21:30 I do tan, but with oil and outside in the sun like a normal person.
2110 2018-05-10 20:21:21 Its all about the money dirty dirty money trump will let israel and iran go to war let the saudis build nukes destroy the delicate balance of peace to do a favor for his master putin and raise oil prices worldwide so russia can make more money dirty bloody money
2111 2018-05-10 20:21:09 Trump thinks he bringing #peace to the north but targeting #Iran to bring #war.  Others who signed the #deal will not let him #destroy their #bottom line.  They want #Iranian oil just like others want oil from Saudi Arabia.
2112 2018-05-10 20:21:07 Who fried them? What were they seasoned with? Taste compared to oil fried?
2113 2018-05-10 20:21:04 As opposed to the Russians - proxy Cold War over a small strip of land with no oil ? Tail doesn't really wag the dog nor is it ZOG
2114 2018-05-10 20:21:01 Thx for replying.  So, they allowed the mass migration as part of an oil deal? They were thinking they need to secure future energy? Now that USA could become oil independent, I can see why they bailed.  God I hope we (Canada) are next.
2115 2018-05-10 20:21:00 got my oil changed for free 
2116 2018-05-10 20:20:55 Hell yeah im sweating out all my damn black castor oil 
2117 2018-05-10 20:20:52 You need to talk to your chief about that. He loves the Indian act. All the oil majors left Canada. Tired of your extortion. De Beers in Attawapiskat had to leave also. They helped build roads and fixed sewers on the reservation. Wasn't enough, so they left too.
2118 2018-05-10 20:20:51 So @osama_gufran you will not & can't vote for @BJP4India as theft of oil #Enroute_Pilferage can't be stopped till #Corrupt_OMC_Beaurocracy is dismantled

2120 2018-05-10 20:20:33 Trumps decision to withdraw from the Iran Nuclear deal has more to help Putin’s oil based economy than anything focused on Iran’s bad behavior...like is Russia’s behavior better than Iran’s?
2121 2018-05-10 20:20:32 If you trust the navy seals that said they killed him. I personally think he's alive seeong as how bin Laden's and bushes go way back in the oil bidness. But we are going on govts version
2122 2018-05-10 20:20:23 Kenny you are a hypocrite!  So Harper can stick his nose into American politics but Gore can't stick his in ours? Quit your lying and fear mongering. It has become quite clear to everyone but you that oil is not the way of the future. #cdnpoli
2123 2018-05-10 20:20:20 Because that’s what we have that’s why we cling to it, but hydro, wind and solar are not complete solutions in our country... the main issue will be IF a large portion of the world stops using oil our producers won’t be able to compete at market prices
2124 2018-05-10 20:20:15 #mining $GLD #energy #economy $ES $OIL apoorv_bh89 Alcoa Apple Thanks!  We think it's pretty cool too.
2125 2018-05-10 20:20:09 Yeah, sure-stay in your cult. Resist away. You’re being lied to and Stormy’s laughing all the way to the bank. What are you resisting anyway? Lower taxes, great economy, peace w/NK, more oil production so cheaper gas, Syria held accountable. Sorry, just not following your logic..
2126 2018-05-10 20:20:06 Awesome please ask our Arabian allied to loosen up on oil reserve prices. I drive for a living and on disability please don’t force us back on. Food stamps these gas prices will make me stop driving 50 + % increase in a year. Its killing my profits
2127 2018-05-10 20:19:59 South Africa, Australia, New Zealand & Canada are all settler colonial in origin, and their wealth depends on the original dispossession and a varying mixture of current white supremacy, Oil or other resource rents, US & UK military protection (also see Five Eyes), commerce rents
2128 2018-05-10 20:19:56 Caribbean Jerk, lemon pepper, or Old Bay with olive oil according to my dad.
2129 2018-05-10 20:19:53 if you're referring to shetland's oil i have no figures on how much went to scotland.
i grew up in the uk's poorest area but had everything i needed.
people are the uk's biggest asset and the opportunities it provides them to get on in life. it's not just about the money, honey.
2130 2018-05-10 20:19:53 We are an oil importing nation.  This is a net negative for us.  Duh. A temporary boost in the fracking fields is not good when we should be trying to get off oil.

Trumpkin is my favorite name for little blind-faith supporters of the orange Birther boy.
2131 2018-05-10 20:19:49 Like oil and water, I don't roll with haughty folks.
2132 2018-05-10 20:19:45 This summer I’m trying to smell like coconut oil and sunscreen and chlorine and salt and have glitter on me 24/7 and be inside like 5% of the time so HMU if you like pina coladas and getting caught in the rai
2133 2018-05-10 20:19:38 Or cod liver oil, boy they’re like a inch long

2135 2018-05-10 20:19:15  the casino thing so true and that glow is just excess oil your body is producing from all the hormones lol. I felt lied to also don't worry lol.
2136 2018-05-10 20:19:10 Aren't there office rules about strong scents! Someone is using a heated oil in their office. But the door is open and you smell it everywhere! It gets stronger by the minute
2137 2018-05-10 20:19:10 Can't wait to hear Scheer blame Trudeau for higher oil prices resulting in Trump's dumping of the Iran Agreement
2138 2018-05-10 20:19:04 Rice. It's a 1 (rice) to 2 (water) ratio. Add a teaspoon of margirin or oil for best results.
2139 2018-05-10 20:19:02 With all that oil and sand, if they nuked 'em you'd end up with a YUGE glass bowl filled with pure Iranian crude . . .

2141 2018-05-10 20:18:48 Is there an essential oil which promotes reluctance to peddle essential oils?

2144 2018-05-10 20:18:15 IT STILL HAS SOME FLAVOR W/ THE SALT AND OLIVE OIL
2145 2018-05-10 20:18:09 In other news, since Trump pulled out of the Iran deal, oil prices are rising and the ruble is strengthening. Putin thanks Trump for this "excellent treatment."
2146 2018-05-10 20:17:58 *rubs popcorn on her because it's the wrong oil* uwu <3
2147 2018-05-10 20:17:57 They got the oil???

2150 2018-05-10 20:17:52 Government by Dunning Kruger effect.

Trump must really believe that global warming is a hoax.

(Or, he is just doing everything to increase oil prices for his pal Putin.)
2151 2018-05-10 20:17:46 I hate getting my oil changed
2152 2018-05-10 20:17:40 S&P +0.9%, DAX +0.6%.

2155 2018-05-10 20:17:25 Japan, Germany & Israel all depend on US aid, military protection & both bi & multi lateral diplomacy to afford their social programs. Germany & UK depend on draining the rest of Europe. Scandinavia depends on oil rents & advantageous control over commercial routes.
2156 2018-05-10 20:17:21 Markets are projecting oil at &100. What will be price of electricity in Pakistan. Time to revisit building hydrodams now and forget the political crap that has plagued Pakistan.

2159 2018-05-10 20:17:03 I am not watching #redape because I know it would be very upsetting - I'd like to remove palm oil from my home entirely (which seems impossible) but it will take an international effort e.g. biofuels
2160 2018-05-10 20:17:03 Before 12:30 today, I took my car in for an oil change, smogged it, and renewed my registration. At this rate, I’ll be a full blown Soccer Mom by June.
2161 2018-05-10 20:16:59 Is Trump doing a favor to Putin? By raising oil price? Same for Saudis?
2162 2018-05-10 20:16:49 African American Horror Story:

My tea tree oil spilled in my suitcase.
2163 2018-05-10 20:16:48 lost my tanning lotion so i ended up using baby oil. i feel like i’m in a porno.
2164 2018-05-10 20:16:35 Man that’s a lot of coin though for two top 2 centers and two top 4 centers. Especially when the Oil need at least two top 4 D men. $7.5m should pay for those two D men and solidly the back end.
2165 2018-05-10 20:16:34 To be fair, many of Trump’s cronies benefit from rising oil prices.
2166 2018-05-10 20:16:32 Oil has been trending up since early 2015
2167 2018-05-10 20:16:31 Picked the wrong day to get an oil change 
2168 2018-05-10 20:16:17 Rising oil is a tax on global economic growth...not bullish

2172 2018-05-10 20:15:50 Oil is over $70 a barrel now and we still have hostages in Iran  #ThanksTrump for making sure we get a war and our economy goes straight off the charts due to your need to satisfy your base and John Bolton.  #IranDealWithdrawl
2173 2018-05-10 20:15:49 Is there such a thing as deforestation free palm oil?
2174 2018-05-10 20:15:47 When I run out of oil, absolutely! 

Fucking Friezing!
2175 2018-05-10 20:15:47 Whip together 2 cups zucchini with 9 tsps daily bread. Mix in Olive Oil. Drain. Serve with a nice chianti.
2176 2018-05-10 20:15:42 Use An oil based serum like biosilk and put it on your ends while your hair is still wet. Also try not to touch your hair at all after you apply product especially when it's dry
2177 2018-05-10 20:15:39 I wonder what percentage @realDonaldTrump gets from Russia now that oil prices are rising? He must be getting a nice cut. But America First, right? #TrumpTreason #TrumpCorruption
2178 2018-05-10 20:15:34 This from a man who claimed he created the internet and has profited millions from selling books on snake oil bullshit.

2181 2018-05-10 20:15:17 They Always Taking All Day To Change My Damn Oil 
2182 2018-05-10 20:15:16 - but he has a point. Politics has downtrodden Canada’s energy. They’ve done it to themselves. Should though oil prices stay up whilst the playing field clears up there’s interesting play in t land.
2183 2018-05-10 20:15:12 Check your Engine oil this morning.
2184 2018-05-10 20:15:09 I don’t need to prove it to you...
2185 2018-05-10 20:14:57 Big oil $USO 14.40 pivot, down up down up repeatedly fish face slapping oil barons, small ball down and up for me, uptrend in place, less war and down she goes, more war and up she goes, supply/demand lost in the $5-$7 fear premium.
2186 2018-05-10 20:14:54 The oil prices rose for months in anticipation. That blip is known as "sell on the news" put of the standard "Buy on the rumor, sell on the news" investment pattern.
2187 2018-05-10 20:14:49 No, leftists manufactured a victim and exacerbated the hatred.
2188 2018-05-10 20:14:49 I love your love of the pesto oil got absorbed or something
2189 2018-05-10 20:14:42 Only one way to get freedom. Have oil. Then watch the US marines give you freedom 
2190 2018-05-10 20:14:39 coconut oil cures everything
2191 2018-05-10 20:14:34 When was the last time you tuned up your body? It's about time you go and get your oil changed! Don't wait until you get sick! #BeforeItHappens #BibleStudy
2192 2018-05-10 20:14:34 that was my reaction too & then you have to work fast bc it dries quickly. it seems like they had to make an oil bc the formula is like that but its weird.
2193 2018-05-10 20:14:32 Why isn't he in PRISON for war crimes?!? 500,000 lives lost in their FAKE WAR for oil. 
2194 2018-05-10 20:14:07 i JUST bought tea tree oil for it bc a coworker of mine said it made her keloid go away so i’m PRAYING i don’t have to take them out bc it was honestly so painful and i love them 
2195 2018-05-10 20:13:53 Because criminals aren’t using #2A to “own” guns.
Legally armed citizens are very affective on crime and have a minuscule amount of accidental shootings.
Criminals, by nature, will get shot.  What happens to them is irrelevant to this discussion.

2199 2018-05-10 20:13:22 I just imagined an insurance company considering insuring a supply of Iranian oil on the assumption that the US might not imposing sanctions this time... Sounds real, does not it?
2200 2018-05-10 20:13:16 @pladis_Global why are you using palm oil when it is devastating our beloved Orangutans? #saynotopalmoil #REDAPE
2201 2018-05-10 20:13:13 A1. We love using staples in new ways, like turning eggs into something sweet (like a pan baby!) and yogurt into something savory, like Greek yogurt with a drizzle of olive oil and sea salt or za’atar spice blend. #AllThatRazz #Sponsored

2205 2018-05-10 20:12:48 I'm so glad I no longer have to drive like I did 10 years ago.
Any, repeat any windfall seen in #GOPTaxScam  will be erroded by the end of the year
Russia's economy revolves around gas and oil.
Putin's mission accomplished
Now they'll partition off Syria and Iran dies on the vine
2206 2018-05-10 20:12:43 Yeah it’s Amla but it’s 100% natural it doesn’t contain all the chemicals and crap that Amla oil from brands like Dabur contains
2207 2018-05-10 20:12:20 I can imagine that the oil price will be a topic too - isn't it time for Russia and OPEC to reverse their production cuts policy?
2208 2018-05-10 20:12:14 eating last night's leftover pizza on the floor of my bedroom & wearing nothing but my boyfriend's t-shirt and coconut oil in my hair

y'know, self-love and stuff
2209 2018-05-10 20:12:12 Oh ya I forgot! Do y’all have oil or nah
2210 2018-05-10 20:12:01 Seriously my lawn mower is gonna need an oil change
2211 2018-05-10 20:11:51 @lizpeek In case nobody is noticing...rising oil/gas prices are wiping out the widely celebrated/touted tax cut savings for the "average" family of 2500./yr. Another DC perpetrated shell game?
2212 2018-05-10 20:11:45 Of course they will. I hope the deplorables like spending the baby food money on Trump's gas. Personally I like Obama 2 dollar gas!
   And yes trump did collude with the Saudis & Russia to jack up oil prices in my opinion! America's economy lives & dies on the price of gas.
2213 2018-05-10 20:11:42 @realDonaldTrump we need to open up oil reserves
2214 2018-05-10 20:11:29 The US has already moved towards renewable resources, they have the money to move quickly to new economies. Ask your conservative politicians why they cling to oil, if you "dig" you'll find they are tied to US Republican billionaire funding.
2215 2018-05-10 20:11:27 No, I just tire of getting links that have been successfully debunked.
Do your homework, without the blinders.
2216 2018-05-10 20:11:26 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has a deal with Russia and non-OPEC producers to cut supplies that has helped erase a global glut and boosted oil prices to their highest since 2014. What does this have to do with the US?
2217 2018-05-10 20:11:25 @realDonaldTrump is a master manipulator. The @Iran deal retraction will make more money for him and his cronies due to the rising oil prices.
2218 2018-05-10 20:11:24 This cowardice from congress is consistent. They voted and approved going into Iraq and then claimed war for oil. They are feckless, soulless people. Our security is not their concern. Haspel is excellent choice.
2219 2018-05-10 20:11:16 Brutal. The Ukrainian oil exploration loan I'm trying to sell has been such a absolute dickfest. I am so caned.
2220 2018-05-10 20:11:14 Shouted out KLM whilst the answers were coming up......now I feel a twat for shouting out an airline whilst all the possible answers ended up being oil companies. #WhoWantsToBeAMillionaire #WWTBAM

2224 2018-05-10 20:11:11 Thank you Donald Trump for the courageous and absolutely correct decision to withdraw from the dangerous Iranian nuclear deal. Pulling out is the only way to keep my parabolic oil profits rolling in. - Vladimir Putin.
2225 2018-05-10 20:11:03 He CORRECTLY changed his view.  The higher oil prices were predicted and they happened.  

Basic supply & demand economics, Trumpkin.

2233 2018-05-10 20:10:20 @POTUS  Your action in pulling out of the Iran deal makes sense primarily as a trillion-dollar gift to Putin (by boosting Russia’s take from the oil market) in exchange for Putin’s many favors to you — like helping  win the presidency and indirectly bailing you out of  your debts
2234 2018-05-10 20:10:17 Yes with balsamic vinegar, extravirgin olive oil, tomatoes, fresh basil, s&p

2238 2018-05-10 20:09:59 @steeletalk About 8 weeks ago, gas prices escalated by about 30 cents a liter. Reason was given as there was maintenance being done in the oil refineries. Exactly how long does this take? Months? IF it's now complete, why aren't gas prices coming down? Who IS making this profit?
2239 2018-05-10 20:09:58 Shorter day at work, done at 3:30. Oil change, post office, and a drink at the Saloon before my 6:00 chiro massage. Off tomorrow. Yay.
2240 2018-05-10 20:09:55 This is completely #fakenews Oil was skyrocketing long before @realDonaldTrump pulled out of the awful Iran Deal
2241 2018-05-10 20:09:53 @realDonaldTrump I feel you're allowing large corporations like utilities, insurance companies, oil and gas Industriesto gouge the average American because you're out of touch with anyone that can't afford the $250,000 it cost to join your Golf Club! Been in a store lately?
2242 2018-05-10 20:09:46 Trump will blame Iran to build his case to go to war. He’ll keep the oil this time.
2243 2018-05-10 20:09:42 Urgh. Baby oil on the inner thigh is my savour.
2244 2018-05-10 20:09:40 $ECA has had surprisingly weak performance compared to $USO (and $WTI) over the last two days. If you believe that these higher oil prices are here to stay, July 17 Calls on ECA are a good buy right now. ECA down 3.38% while USO is up 2.49% over the last two sessions. #OOTT

2260 2018-05-10 20:08:51 Oil and his friendship with Putin is the only reason he hired Rex Tillerson for SoS. That didn't work out and he still has some serious favors to repay to Putin, so I think you're onto something.
2261 2018-05-10 20:08:17 We can go round and round with the debunked leftist BS on armed citizens but I’d just prefer to stick with the last CDC study that obama ordered and got.
It showed that armed citizenry are very effective.
2262 2018-05-10 20:08:16 The whole aim of the Trump Admin is to increase oil prices for fossil fuel companies.
2263 2018-05-10 20:08:07 Make your oil & gas money and then marry me. Let me do the shaku shaku

2270 2018-05-10 20:07:17 I had the same thing a few weeks ago when I was in the U.S., you can use a sponge and some vegetable oil and a plastic card to get it off. 
Really ridiculous they can do that -.-

2273 2018-05-10 20:07:07 does anyone profit from republican/democrat hate?
this economy's fountain is Perpetual War & Oil.
2274 2018-05-10 20:07:06 Always counts :)

Truthfully, I still see the same story w/ China slowing & US beginning to slow. We can creep along like this for a while until the banks begin to tighten their lending standards & commodities roll over (like oil & copper). Slowly working on a post about it
2275 2018-05-10 20:07:00 I wouldn’t be surprised at all. At anytime he manipulated the markets. But, just think. In a little over a year, oil prices rose more than$40/barrel. I read that this brings in an extra $500+M a day in revenue to Russia. And, you know Putin has his hand in the oil companies
2276 2018-05-10 20:06:56 Too bad that the UK/France/Germany will have to find other means of getting their oil now that Iran (their buds) have sanctions coming back full force on them... GOOD!! May, Marcon, and Merkel (3 Muskateers) must've gotten some of the mystery money?? Time to pay that back to US!
2277 2018-05-10 20:06:56 Reese’s are probably the only major candy that doesn’t use palm oil. Bravo.
2278 2018-05-10 20:06:55 #MAGA @realDonaldTrump @POTUS We really really missed those high gas prices, glad you found a way to bring them back, so the tax cut $ for the poor now flows to your oil buds. Anxious to see how high price gas helps the economy. Is it going be like the tax giveaway to the rich?
2279 2018-05-10 20:06:53 Did you know Afghanistan has an estimated $3 trillion in untapped mineral resources, in addition to Balochistan's $1 trillion in gold, copper, oil, precious stones, coal, chromite and natural gas? That's why a lot of countries want Afghanistan, including China.
2280 2018-05-10 20:06:40 I use it for all my oil changes! They have great deals on there sometimes
2281 2018-05-10 20:06:32 you smell like burnt oil

2284 2018-05-10 20:06:07 What’s the point of an oil free foundation that you need to ADD oil to for it to apply good , sounds like you need to spend dumb money on multiple products when i can just go to Sephora type thing and get one foundation !
2285 2018-05-10 20:06:05 Putin a tiny man with big ego with a country running out of oil and money ! Maybe he’s paying Trump too much !
2286 2018-05-10 20:06:05 Yes, the military functioned better and operated so much more efficiently when it was just men.
These units function as a group, they need to know each other have their backs (not in the way you like).
2287 2018-05-10 20:05:43 Subtitle: What a country will do to get sanctions eased or up the price for oil.
2288 2018-05-10 20:05:42 No oh, they should just go empty handed without any money and be shining their eyes  like rat  that wants to lick  red oil.

2291 2018-05-10 20:05:35 OH HELL NAHjust for oil change ??
2292 2018-05-10 20:05:30 Tell that to Corporate Farmers,  Big Oil, Big Coal, Sugar growers,  the 1%,Etc.
2293 2018-05-10 20:05:22 It's boring af in this waiting room they take 20yrs for a oil change 
2294 2018-05-10 20:05:22 Russia will tell Iran to stay in compliance. They’re both oil rich countries laughing all the way to the bank.
2295 2018-05-10 20:05:21 Exactly -- they know what they're doing here, and more importantly, this is a favor for Putin -- the Russian national budget lives or dies on oil price.

The US oil corporations are more or less along for the ride.

This is primarily a favor for Putin.
2296 2018-05-10 20:05:08 I really do believe the Iranian/Israelis hate is a little deeper than oil... But I tend to aggree with your argument in general.
2297 2018-05-10 20:05:00 No he didn’t. But we did go kick some ass after and take they’re oil yeeyee

2301 2018-05-10 20:04:39 Oh really. It’s about oil. If you’re seriously going to argue that Iran has the right to obtain nuclear weapons because we have the second amendment in America, you are arguing that the globalists do have a one world government and we’re all happy global citizens on one Earth.
2302 2018-05-10 20:04:30 Right, I have a Fullan quote I use often. But- snake oil salesman is an accusation I’ve seen levelled at him. Thoughts?

2304 2018-05-10 20:04:29 Otro dato. En esos seis años todas las empresas colombianas de servicios de consultoría e ingeniería que trabajaban para Oil & Gas fueron compradas o asociadas a la matriz de multinacionales de ese sector.
2305 2018-05-10 20:04:28 Dear #MAGA #trumptrain #Deplorables @FoxNews @foxandfriends minions: #TrumpTaxScam #IranDealWithdrawl raising oil & gas prices that’ll eat away YOUR #crumbs immediately, then all price rises due to transportation costs including groceries, clothes, school supplies, EVERYTHING.
2306 2018-05-10 20:04:28 Why is it politicians here in the US are preaching the dangers of the Opioid "epidemic" when the only pain relief for those of us with chronic pain government insurance (Medicaid) will pay for is Opioids? I want to give CBD oil a try but at $60+ there is no way I can afford it.
2307 2018-05-10 20:04:24 Dow is up 196 and now in pos. areas for 2018. Not Obama's economy btw, it is DJT's.  Oh and CNBC lies that Iran dis will raise oil prices. No. US has more oil now, more from Can., Mex., its own drilling and OPEC not as powerful. The more drilling, lower prices.
2308 2018-05-10 20:04:21 How about we get right about the conflicts in the Middle East over oil? Everyone needs to Google "Genie Energy" and the massive oil field found in the Golan Heights.

I realize NY has the largest American Jew population but, pandering and a blind eye isn't going to solve anything
2309 2018-05-10 20:04:18 I've had many Trump supporters in the last year tell me that the "proof" he isn't in Putin's pocket is that he's encouraging oil/gas/coal development, which will supposedly drive oil prices down and hurt Russia.
2310 2018-05-10 20:04:09 The squeaky wheel always gets the media’s oil and sadly democrats have no interest in squeaking
2311 2018-05-10 20:04:05 Putin a joke ! He already trying to gets his hands on Iranian oil while supporting Israel ! Trump simply followed Putin’s orders to bail out to keep his security in Syria safe ! After all Putin wouldn’t want Israel as enemy alongside Iran when their oil is so precious to Russia
2312 2018-05-10 20:04:04 wenger probably didn’t play him so oil can be fit for WC… pathetic
2313 2018-05-10 20:03:57 I have the hair oil too, I live by it

2316 2018-05-10 20:03:49 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.

2320 2018-05-10 20:03:27 This is because of Trump. Not honoring the Iran deal is forcing crude oil prices to go up. There is no WINNING with Trump. #ettd
2321 2018-05-10 20:03:26 Who attacked a tran-whatever and didn’t get convicted?
This is where you are manufacturing victims.

2322 2018-05-10 20:03:25 @realDonaldTrump We have enough oil in this country that we don't need to worry about other countries, Let their prices go up, Nad ours Stay low like before
2323 2018-05-10 20:03:20 Oooops.  Your comment didn’t age well Rex.  Days after announcement of withdrawal from JCPOA the Ruble is strengthening and oil prices are rising.  Ouch.

2328 2018-05-10 20:03:03 If you were one of the lucky, average working people to get a tax refund, raise or bonus, you will need it. 

Trump's breaking deal with Iran has raised oil/gas prices to offset any gains.

Thanks @realdonaldtrump!
2329 2018-05-10 20:02:55 Argh rice oil ist bald alle  

Meine Haut kann nicht alleine leben ! :D
2330 2018-05-10 20:02:53 For you with your obsessive Trump hate, everything is Trump's fault.  Oil prices, economic growth, NK, surge in biz investment, wage increases, bonuses.......all of it.  Maybe you should price gas in Geneva or Tokyo.
2331 2018-05-10 20:02:43 Maybe Edexcel could write a BTEC? Level 1/2, learn to hold a placard. Level 3 is making a fire from an oil drum and maintaining a picket line.
2332 2018-05-10 20:02:39 Has Trump’s decision to pull out of Iran arms deal triggered an Arms Race in the Middle East? As tensions rise between Israel and Iran will conflict expand? What will happen to oil prices? #Social30 “Social Studies never sleeps” #Iran #NuclearDeal
2333 2018-05-10 20:02:31 well, if @bcbreakaway didn't force you eat all your meals in Toronto at the Costco, then maybe you could have went to the St Lawrence or Kensington Markets and gotten *real* cheese, y'know, the kind that's not 90% oil.
2334 2018-05-10 20:02:27 And speed limits were a temporary measure because of the oil crisis.
2335 2018-05-10 20:02:15 For the record, oil producer group naming Twitter is my favourite Twitter.
2336 2018-05-10 20:02:06 I think my Nonna is trying to kill me. First she poisoned my chicken with coconut oil now she's trying to get me to eat cupcakes with coconut shavings on them.
2337 2018-05-10 20:02:05 I had the oil during pregnancy and it didn't help anything. Everyone's skin is different though
2338 2018-05-10 20:02:03 It was not a mess and they were in compliance. You just helped Russia earn billions in oil revenues and have endangered USA and EU. #ImpeachTrump #BlueWaveComing2018
2339 2018-05-10 20:02:01 When is it not about the oil? 100% over it.
2340 2018-05-10 20:01:51 Not ignorance. Deliberate action to please large oil suppliers.
2341 2018-05-10 20:01:49 Data isnt the new Oil. Data is Nuclear, great while you are using it, hard to store and terrible if it goes wrong.
2342 2018-05-10 20:01:48 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews The problem with OIL prices is speculation of oil prices that may or may not rise, And the so called shut down for repairs That the Union over charges to fix for the next year, TIME for Our President To Do something About Gouging
2343 2018-05-10 20:01:37 Oil is true goth eyeliner
2344 2018-05-10 20:01:30 Outrageous that European country’s are going to pour millions into this barbaric regime, for we’re led to believe the Nuclear deal when it’s their oil reserves they want. Meanwhile the people continue their suffering.
2345 2018-05-10 20:01:29 Price of oil & gas going up due to iran. This will negate tax cuts. Gop quiet on this trump rally today will ignore it.

2351 2018-05-10 20:01:07 So oil prices will go up??? And Trump (who is heavily invested in oil as are Koch Bros and lots of R legislaors) will make more money???  Trump only does what lines his and his big biz billionaires pockets...ans who pays. US!
2352 2018-05-10 20:01:03 Has the growth in the #global #economy peaked, as some speculate? For now, rising #oil prices are giving #energy companies—and #markets—a boost.
2353 2018-05-10 20:00:56 Also, that has its own limitations. We Indians got cheap oil from Iran when they had sanctions, didn't hurt our trade with US either.
2354 2018-05-10 20:00:50 They spent  weekend buying you alcohol, none of them is offering to take your CV with and submit just in case something comes up at their work place or to just edit your CV for you.

2355 2018-05-10 20:00:47 Why aren’t you protesting the largest boom in oil exports in U S history! Your outrage is so fake
2356 2018-05-10 20:00:43 Current pet peeve: loud office chairs. In a perfect world, there would be oil available to kill the squeaks.
2357 2018-05-10 20:00:37 But Moscow does not want to see oil climb back above the $80-$90 p/bbl range as was seen before 2014, he continued.  According to him, Russia fears that a high price will only lead to reduced demand, accelerated investment into electric vehicles and alternative energies and that

2363 2018-05-10 20:00:04 Lmao when you use it once, you’ll never go back... you don’t even need to pray the pan or use oil
2364 2018-05-10 19:59:58 Am sure we have sikhs in oil fields, we all know hard hat is recommended, let’s forget d beards. Would they comply to d safety standard or present a case of religion to d company? Let’s set d record straight in dis issue; safety first! No helmet No bike. Kapish!
2365 2018-05-10 19:59:52 Lol...this can’t be true, man!  Oil and gas industry is dying and the price of gas is only going to skyrocket.  Wait until the libs are ousted, and the veil of lies is lifted.
2366 2018-05-10 19:59:52 It’s OK, we knew you were just as stupid as Donald.
Y’all have really pissed in your Cheerios this time. Rising oil prices will stall the economy, the Israelis have been looking for an excuse for war with Iran and our credibility in the region is for shit. Yeah, smooth move ExLax
2367 2018-05-10 19:59:47 Exactly who is doing that?
2368 2018-05-10 19:59:44 We are witnessing unintended consequences of Trump’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. Trump never thinks through anything and we will end up paying the price. Oil prices will be going higher and gas prices will rise. I would prefer not paying more to drive.
2369 2018-05-10 19:59:43 Big Oil wants another century of subsidies and to kill all competition. #SaveTheRFS #StopBigOil
2370 2018-05-10 19:59:39 Could this Iran thing be a Trump payback to the oil industry? If the markets become unstable prices will go up and big oil wins.
If war breaks out or military one upmanship occurs, big oil wins.
Does Trump have oil investments? Follow the money!

2374 2018-05-10 19:59:07 Singapore is where Russia's Rosneft Oil Company has an office located.

2376 2018-05-10 19:58:52 This is a war that has been going on for centuries.    This is a holy war to them.  And it’s past time that the USA  back out and let them fight amongst themselves.    The only reason we are there is to protect our oil interests.
2377 2018-05-10 19:58:46 YES! Jobs for oil workers!

2381 2018-05-10 19:58:32 Mr. @JustinTrudeau I am all for the expansions of BC coast exit to Asia for Canadian oil. Its funny though that many Albertans still hate anything related to the old policy of nationalization of the industry by your dad in the eighties.
2382 2018-05-10 19:58:19 How did you make your money. 
American replied real estate. 
How did you make your money. British man replied manufacturing. 
How did you make your money,  Russian replied oil and Gas. 
How did you make your money. Nigerian replied NA GOD OOO. 

2383 2018-05-10 19:58:01 オフ会するたびに「女の子だったの！？てっきり男だと思ってた！！てか普通にかわいくね？」って言われて 
そのあとLINEとかで告白されてぶち犯されるからオフ会苦手( ･ᴗ･̥̥̥ )
2384 2018-05-10 19:58:00 They're buds.. Dipped in oil (concentrates) amd covered in trichomes (keef or crystals)..  It's just messy..  Not fun to smoke. You can put all 3 in a bowl and smoke it a lot easier than these little bastards.
2385 2018-05-10 19:57:57 Still offering my services as an Oil Technician. I can have the ladies glazing!
2386 2018-05-10 19:57:38 That was OUR thing. You people stole our sand like you stole our oil.
2387 2018-05-10 19:57:31 I agree with you. But you're not going to find a state where residents do want it, unless the nuclear industry pays them a la Oil $$ to Alaskans, and even then it's not going to be popular.
2388 2018-05-10 19:57:30 NeoConserversatives are salivating over the unrest caused by the break with the Iran Treaty has caused! No wonder an arms race has started and oil prices will rise and finally their call for war!
2389 2018-05-10 19:57:30 Allah gyara mana
2390 2018-05-10 19:57:24 Typical Chelsea fan forgetting football existed before oil money 
2391 2018-05-10 19:57:23 @KaeElmer If oil goes to $100 or higher, how much would gas be in Hawaii?

I'd be taking the horse to work.
2392 2018-05-10 19:57:22 @tonaughton  I don't think the Iran Pact withdrawal was done for our best interests. Economists are already saying the price of oil (including Russian oil) will jump dramatically. Remember Putin asked Trump for huge financial help. I think this is the help.
2393 2018-05-10 19:57:20 寝てません
2394 2018-05-10 19:57:11 I have to disagree you that Trump is ignorant to the economics here. Guess who makes more $$ b/c we pulled out of the Iran deal? Yep. Oil companies. Who do you think tRump is looking out for? Yep. Oil companies 
2395 2018-05-10 19:57:11 Looks like "Collusion" to me. How many Oil Stocks does Trump own? @SenateMajLdr @tedlieu @NancyPelosi
2396 2018-05-10 19:57:10 Hussein is what you get when you elect smooth talking snake oil salesmen
2397 2018-05-10 19:57:04 the same way Iraq had little to do with oil?
what are your sources?
2398 2018-05-10 19:57:03 Glam glow’s mud to foam cleanser, a rose water based cleanser at night, collagen masks and coconut oil!
2399 2018-05-10 19:57:02 Title of FFTT published today - "Markets appear to be shifting to 'war-footing': USD up, oil & gold remain bid, SPX/TLT rising."

The fact that US Congress is finally concerned about Chinese trade policies is a sign we may be in the very late innings of this game.
2400 2018-05-10 19:56:57 It's not a fair question. Torture is sleep deprivation? It's ill defined for one, secondly depending on circumstances what is too far to go?
2401 2018-05-10 19:56:40 Progressive are snake oil sellers
2402 2018-05-10 19:56:39 Rape plant has a yellow flower and is used to make canola oil, a form of vegetable oil. It's a natural ingrediant.
2403 2018-05-10 19:56:34 Sometimes I think I’m tough, then I remember I apply coconut oil to my face everyday... #stilltough
2404 2018-05-10 19:56:29 Crude oil is up +70% since June 2017 !!
2405 2018-05-10 19:56:23 Yeah, that’s illegal.
Already laws to convict them.
Here’s the problem, you, as a leftist, think some new magical law will be the straw that breaks the criminals’ backs and they’ll finally follow one that you make up.
Weird people get attacked, angry person goes to jail, duh.
2406 2018-05-10 19:56:22 And please don't say coconut oil 
2407 2018-05-10 19:56:21 We need oil and gas but as long as the drilling is done in someone else’s backyard you’re ok with it? I don’t think your luxury helicopter runs on wind power. We need a Governor that can promote renewable energy without demonizing the fossil fuel industry and that’s NOT you.
2408 2018-05-10 19:56:20 Been at the dealership for about an hour waiting for an oil change, I've been listing to this guy talk himself through which Keurig k-cup he's gonna pick for about 10 mins, I'm on my second juice box, and I need to go to the bathroom but I don't know where it is. The struggle.
2409 2018-05-10 19:56:18 I would not be surprised if Trump is getting money or will get money as a result of rising oil and gas prices behind his violating the #IranDeal. Most corrupt POTUS ever.
2410 2018-05-10 19:56:15 Hey trump I know how you are going to pay Putin for that favor with NC by ricing the gas prices so Putin Iran the Saudis Venezuela can start making money again from oil
2411 2018-05-10 19:56:15 Well Putin is richer now. 1st Syria bombing, and now the biggie Iran. Price of oil will get Putin out of hock for his promises. Indeed this was probably the quid pro quo.
2412 2018-05-10 19:56:06 Or bombing brown people over oil or perhaps wrecking the economy and sailing off into the sunset with all the houses and pensions for example. Agreed.
2413 2018-05-10 19:56:01 Flint still drinking poison water. Diplomacy going terrible. NK only minor success, due to their development of nuclear weapons. Destroying our social programs, which is starving children and having elderly evicted. DAP keeping us hooked on oil, killing new jobs.
2414 2018-05-10 19:55:57 Hopefully the good oil to help us snare todays place 6.
2415 2018-05-10 19:55:51 Coconut oil got me right 
2416 2018-05-10 19:55:50 old is young, bad is good, oil is sustainable. Got it.
2417 2018-05-10 19:55:48  hnd shake
2418 2018-05-10 19:55:37 Gas prices weren’t climbing in our area until he started getting ready to pull out of the Iran deal. Up over 40 cents in five days and due to go up again. His wealthy friends in the oil and gas market will make out great. The rest of America- he could care less about the impact.
2419 2018-05-10 19:55:35 It's an essential oil
2420 2018-05-10 19:55:26 Learn also to remain the most humble during the process.
2421 2018-05-10 19:55:25 They’re mad cause he appointed a women that has no problems getting her hands dirty. Yet the US government has been secretly killing ppl all over the world for our own best interests ie money and oil. BUT THATS OKAY.
2422 2018-05-10 19:55:22 Al Gore doesn’t lie and exaggerate because it’s inconvenient for him

Al Gore lies about Climate Change and Oil Sands because it’s profitable for him

He has learned from some of the most polished liars in the world GreenPeace 

It’s not the environment it’s the leftist’s profits
2423 2018-05-10 19:55:22 It is Carter Page and he has continued the ruse in all his interviews. Paid FBI for Preet and Carlin case (all part of small group).  He is no oil analyst, he is a spook that came out of Naval Intelligence. They pulled FISA to cover it up. It is all a frame up!
2424 2018-05-10 19:55:22 Ginger+clove oil+ honey.. 2 spoon every 2-3 hour.. simple honey won't be effective
2425 2018-05-10 19:55:19 Page 363 and 364 of your owner's manual provides information regarding approved oil types for your vehicle. ^RR
2426 2018-05-10 19:54:57 Me thinks the US wants higher oil prices...hence Iran sanctions...?
2427 2018-05-10 19:54:48 yo hows your diet? N you tried peppermint oil?
2428 2018-05-10 19:54:47 I remember a time I went to get my oil changed and one of the customers confused my mother for my wife. I was shook 
2429 2018-05-10 19:54:45 About as complicated as how much oil is in the Golan Heights. It’s all about the dollar.

2431 2018-05-10 19:54:20 i’ve been rubbing vitamin e oil on them for the past month or so to help w the scar tissue and it honestly wasn’t even that bad!!! so many holes in my nips now lol
2432 2018-05-10 19:54:17 Where’s my coconut oil?
2433 2018-05-10 19:54:16 Iran's hate for Israel has little to do with oil. It is real. These mad dogs are going to fight. It's just a matter of time.
2434 2018-05-10 19:54:12 He gave him the gift of oil.
2435 2018-05-10 19:54:09 I’m tryna be on the beach getting oil rubbed on my

80% beef 20% fat

God said trim the fat because the fat breaks down into OIL

AGAIN !!!! IT IS THE OIL CAUSING YOUR INFLAMMATION AND ALL YOUR DESEASES

STOP INGESTING, EATING, DRINKING,INJECTING OIL

ALL OIL IS BAD...olive, corn, canola
2439 2018-05-10 19:53:58 4 / And I always found it interesting that @SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC & @SenatorCollins who have almost no BLM oil and gas production in their states  decided to vote with the Leftist Dems on this bill.
2440 2018-05-10 19:53:53 I told you I don’t care if you knock off your offspring, stop saying things that aren’t true.
2441 2018-05-10 19:53:51 They will plunder the oil in the Arab country.

2443 2018-05-10 19:53:41 LOL my pets eat better than most people. Blue’s breakfast repertoire usually consists of vegetable + egg “fried rice”, which is quinoa, coconut oil, egg, assorted veggies, and no salt or soy sauce. Or it’s birdie pancakes which are sooo good for humans too 
2444 2018-05-10 19:53:21 As a former oil company employee, I guess I'm getting richer...WOOHOO!
2445 2018-05-10 19:53:09 There are laws against attacking people.
It doesn’t matter how confused the person was that was attacked.
People get jail time, so what’s the problem?

2450 2018-05-10 19:52:49 The oil sector is de facto bared from sanctions. Same case with Russia. US companies have ongoing join ventures with them. EU has a mechanism used on trade with Cuba from 1996 that protects its companies when being affected by US sanctions when "violating" them. Same here soon.
2451 2018-05-10 19:52:46 The big beneficiary is Putin - Trump’s sowing discontent with US allies while raising the price of oil and gas.

2453 2018-05-10 19:52:28 #realDonaldTrump  It makes perfect sense. Your decision to withdraw from the Iran pact to give Russia vastly improved oil prices can be considered  an act of treason.
2454 2018-05-10 19:52:18 Just refreshing and refreshing, Oil Slick on repeat.
2455 2018-05-10 19:51:52 Hey Oil. Would you overpay for Erik Karlsson if he extended? Say, Drai, Nurse, Benson and #10?
2456 2018-05-10 19:51:38 $SAEX continuing to be patient here. $USO (oil) continues to go higher so expecting SAEX to run eventually

2461 2018-05-10 19:51:07 Washing up liquid? Usually good for removing oil stains. Not sure its effect on tent material, so maybe check on a small area first.
2462 2018-05-10 19:50:58 Explain, in detail, what was wrong with the deal. Explain why all of our allies are begging us to keep it. Explain to us Russia celebrating us violating the deal, as this puts oil dollars in their pocket.

2465 2018-05-10 19:50:34 Get some sort of oil/lubricant, leave it a while then go back with the mole grips/pliers 
2466 2018-05-10 19:50:34 Again, not an issue if no one knows.
Has anyone ever asked you to prove your gender in a bathroom?
Again, this is a non-issue.
2467 2018-05-10 19:50:32 Why do trans allies use 'folk' or even 'folx' for people who identify/claim to be transgender? It has the ingratiating reek of TV evangelist snake oil..
2468 2018-05-10 19:50:31 On State TV in Russia they thanked Trump for getting out of the deal because they can now make money on oil!!!
2469 2018-05-10 19:50:27 WTI Crude Oil +0.4% at 71.37 bbl $USO
Gold +0.7% at 1322.50 oz $GLD
Copper +1.6% at 3.11 lb  $CU
2470 2018-05-10 19:50:24 However don't think that it was anything more than a threat. Except for the profits of increased oil prices after the end of the Iran nuclear deal. Saudi Arabia asserts power and stability, however creates a few more enemies or at least some discontent
2471 2018-05-10 19:50:14 yes bi oil c'est cool il paraît!
2472 2018-05-10 19:50:10 U.S. gets roughly 13% of its oil from the Persian Gulf the majority of which is from Saudi Arabia. 

Oh and Iran shot missiles into Israel last night so yeah the Iran deal sucked Iran can’t be trusted.

Spike is expected it will stabilize after the hysteria you’re trying to help
2473 2018-05-10 19:50:03 its specifically BITUMEN not OIL. There is a huge difference that you are ignoring here. AND it's going to markets that will refine and sell BACK to Canada at an inflated rate.
2474 2018-05-10 19:50:00 WTI oil at $71.51/barrel, +$0.37.
2475 2018-05-10 19:50:00 I feel like I should be doing more for my nighttime skincare routine than just using rosehip oil, but I have no idea where to start.
2476 2018-05-10 19:49:59 @michaeltg 
Remember you thought oil prices would be $100
Now banksters of America are calling for it. 
So, if $100, why not $150?
How much would gas be?
2477 2018-05-10 19:49:58 Nice nice okay cool yea I use shea I use doo grow leave in and I have Cantu has well ... I wash once a week and try put a oil spray or something like every another day I use black castor oil as well
2478 2018-05-10 19:49:57 Except for the increase in Russian oil sales due to sanctions and exit from Iran deal. Thank u Trump. Putin wins again!
2479 2018-05-10 19:49:47 Deen first
2480 2018-05-10 19:49:41 It’s not that I mind my cube mate having a diffuser, but there’s one oil that they use that makes my allergies worse and my eyes water every. time.
2481 2018-05-10 19:49:38 Iran huh?  not even Russia this time...nothing to see here....nothing to do with funding terrorists, gas pipelines, oil in Golan Heights, attacks from Israel, on and on and on....just that bad guy Assad and those Damn Iranians!
2482 2018-05-10 19:49:34 No too many carbs. See The Magic Pill on Netflix. (No pill or snake oil involved )
2483 2018-05-10 19:49:24 Reminds me of how gas prices rose modestly following the first Trade Center Tower attacks. After 9/11, though, US gas went to $5.00!a gallon. Did Russia benefit from that? Is Ru so dependent on gas prices riding they’d start WW3? Also: if oil rises? Fracking STOPS. Hello GOP base
2484 2018-05-10 19:49:22 Apply ka ng grant sa OIL ng OVCA! Congratssss
2485 2018-05-10 19:49:19 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
2486 2018-05-10 19:49:18 This obviously isn’t aimed at Dr. McFaul, but those trying to imply that the global oil market (that supplies the world, including China/India, hence global) is being manipulated by Trump to help Putin
2487 2018-05-10 19:49:17 How about good old  vanilla whipped cream ? Whipped topping makes me think of fake things such as cool whip or whipped up oil which is essentially cool whip !
2488 2018-05-10 19:49:14 I'm also saying that some things just aren't subjective. There is a definite number of how much there is of a said finite resource (coal, oil, lithium). We have to work within the parameters we're given unless we accept collapse as acceptable
2489 2018-05-10 19:49:04 Gaining the respect of our allies? You’re out of your mind. The big beneficiary of Spanky’s actions is Putin - it’s driving a wedge between US and our allies while raising the price of oil. 
2490 2018-05-10 19:49:03 Lol ya mean
2491 2018-05-10 19:49:00 Tire rubber and motor oil..... okay....
2492 2018-05-10 19:48:44 I've never put it neat on open sores. Only a few drops in the bath or you can mix it with coconut or almond oil. Lavender oil is quite nice too.
I got given a pressure cushion for my armchair.
The only other rule of thumb...no lacy knickers and no tight jeans 
2493 2018-05-10 19:48:32 Uhh coconut oil Sheen head ass 
2494 2018-05-10 19:48:19 with any oil you gotta do the tiniest amount and focus it on the ends, while yr hair is wet preferably. i use coconut to moisturize AND style, and i got fine but voluminous hair
2495 2018-05-10 19:48:16 When Mossadegh nationalized oil, the British put Iran on economic sanctions & blockaded the Persian Gulf, preventing our maritime trade. Prices for goods went up. Was that Mossadegh's fault? What westerners did post '79 is same thing.
2496 2018-05-10 19:48:15 You have no argument here as Obama isn't in office. Dump has SHIT in the game. When you see gas and oil shoot through the roof and the stock market crash just remember you loved Dump and he is the king of debt and destruction.
2497 2018-05-10 19:48:14 you’re supposed to use the oil though i saw jackie aina’s review & it made it look better. she’s also oily or maybe another concealer?
2498 2018-05-10 19:48:11 Wow.  Good job trump.  Oil prices are RiSING    And the RUBLE  is strengthening.   Putin is sooo happy    His investment is paying off big
2499 2018-05-10 19:47:39 Thank you, Al Gore. The 7O% Texas owned #KinderMorgan pipeline isn’t for transporting oil for home consumption in Canada, it’s for exporting diluted bitumen to the US, at great risk to our fresh water and coast. Time to invest in #cleanenergy @JustinTrudeau
2500 2018-05-10 19:47:35 Just finding out we CAPTURED 5 high level ISIS under her leadership. ISIS is being dismantled and destroyed sooner than later.
Foolish move.
2501 2018-05-10 19:47:31 If North Korea had oil, the US would have invaded along time ago and dismantled the leadership then cleansed their actions through the media in the name of liberating North Koreans.
2502 2018-05-10 19:47:09 i want to mail him a diffuser and some coconut oil poor baby his roots must be DYING
2503 2018-05-10 19:47:07 Me rn but with rose hip oil. I look like I was rolled in butter like corn on the cob
2504 2018-05-10 19:47:05 Get an amber necklace, cold wash rag, and diluted copaiba oil (I got mine from Young living) and rub it on his gums. It’s pitiful watching them in pain. Best of luck!
2505 2018-05-10 19:47:02 moonshine up we go oil and water how we do it timing is everything why you always gotta have the best bridges @lights
2506 2018-05-10 19:47:00 The 1988 paper/recommendations were mostly data before Reagan's bisphenol A decision in 1985. All cans, even the liners of all bottle lids are bisphenol molecules with their estrogen/mutagen/clot effects. From beer to cans of olive oil we are exposed, confusing future studies.
2507 2018-05-10 19:46:59 And some experts said #Oil would fall below $30 and stay.
2508 2018-05-10 19:46:57 To save the high seas & coastal areas, oil pollution at sea has to be reduced without compromising the increasing trend of energy demand. Potentials of innovative research has to be ensured by funding to ensure international security to climate change threat of negative impacts.
2509 2018-05-10 19:46:54 How man go do
2510 2018-05-10 19:46:54 Yes, please keep oil spills away from my vacation spot!
2511 2018-05-10 19:46:51 Most turned to GPs and Calms for help. But they had either drank the kool aid or passed problem to "experts in Mermaids". In the end the Lorenzo oil in this crisis turned out to be other mums and dads.
2512 2018-05-10 19:46:44 Thanks for the article :)
I know. What I was suggesting at first was sanctions in general, don't think it had to be oil. However, nuclear weapons are the most common feared thing in international stage. There would be quite good forms of creating pressure.

2514 2018-05-10 19:46:29 Meke faruwa?
2515 2018-05-10 19:46:11 Anandji please have an electric car with 200 mike range in India in 2 years. India will be eternally grateful to you. With oil market going up post JCPOA, we need a real alternative
2516 2018-05-10 19:46:08 Don’t care.
2517 2018-05-10 19:46:07 Yep, oil prices up.
2518 2018-05-10 19:45:56 So why the need for government intervention?
Problem solved.
Stop manufacturing victims.
2519 2018-05-10 19:45:51 Yeah, he was fairly stubborn about it... Not sure if part of it was pride at proving he could outdo the oil money on his own terms. Got the impression Wenger had a bit of that as well.
2520 2018-05-10 19:45:49 It be so high. I hate getting oil changes.
2521 2018-05-10 19:45:39 Lol meanwhile I’m skimming oil off of ponds for trucks to suck it out 
2522 2018-05-10 19:45:31 Has Putin thanked you for getting the price of oil up and increasing the rupees value.
2523 2018-05-10 19:45:29 Fact: Crude Oil was $26.00 a barrel on election day 2016. Today Crude is $77.00 a barrel. The American people get screwed and the Russians are the one government that benefits the most by these prices. @realDonaldTrump + #Putin = Bend over America!!! #RESIST #RESIST
2524 2018-05-10 19:45:24 My brain like coconut oil when u leave it out in the sun for too long
2525 2018-05-10 19:45:22 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2526 2018-05-10 19:45:22 Please, let’s drop the “Trump did this to help Putin” angle. Some here have such a poor understanding of the oil market that you shouldn’t be commenting. The oil market is incredibly complex and somewhat artificially inflated, so the unrest in the ME made this inevitable
2527 2018-05-10 19:45:21 Well if not my boyfriend has a tip for you. He has hyperflexible joints and pain 24/7 and uses CBD oil for it. :)
2528 2018-05-10 19:45:16 That's why I closed nymex wti crude oil sell call with $00.64 point pft, now see again market UP

2530 2018-05-10 19:45:04 “Hey a red oil pan looking light came on”
2531 2018-05-10 19:45:02 Talk about the three stooges! Al Gore a professional liar, Horgan whose balls sit in Weaver's soft palms, and Gregor who actually believes he can live with no oil and gas, but makes no attempts to try. What a sad trio you three are! Pathetic...
2532 2018-05-10 19:44:53 Oil prices rising and Putin's financial troubles are evaporating.
2533 2018-05-10 19:44:52 @JeepCares what kind of motor oil do you use in a 2018 Jeep compass.
2534 2018-05-10 19:44:51 Agricultural exports with Augmented Reality (AR) is the next oil and gas in Nigeria! Retweet if you grab the concept!
2535 2018-05-10 19:44:10 Yup, water on an oil fire...there’s a plan! 
2536 2018-05-10 19:44:02 NNPC could not have allocated fund without the approval of President. Supposing we were to believe osibanjo's lies, where would the money come from ? It might interest you to know that NNPC doesn't not have the jurisdiction to spend the money it generates from sale of crude oil
2537 2018-05-10 19:43:50 LOL Saudi Arabia princes are no friend of mine or anyone I know. They exploit us through gas prices just as bad as the neocon oil tycoons here that Ben S adores.

2539 2018-05-10 19:43:38 Russia's compromised agent of influence, Trump, did Putin a solid. Thanks to Trump's insane foreign policy blunder over Iran, oil prices are going up. #PutinAtWar can now pay for more death and destruction in Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
2540 2018-05-10 19:43:37 Sir, I am still of the opinion that Lagos is not what it is because of oil money. Lagos started having industries before oil money started flowing. Apapa, Ikeja, Ogba, Ilupeju and other industrial estates were functional before oil money. Kindly validate this.
2541 2018-05-10 19:43:33 I am not LYING TO YOU !!!

ALL.... YES ALL YOUR DOCTORS ARE LYING TO YOU !!!

STOP PUTTING OIL ON YOUR SALAD AN ON FOODS !!

STOP IT IS MURDERING YOU !!

IT WILL NOT DILUTE THE TOXINS, SUGARS AND SALTS
2542 2018-05-10 19:43:19 My favorite aromatic oil is 
rose, lavender, rosemary.
2543 2018-05-10 19:43:19 I never thought of using tea tree oil. What about when you have open wounds. I would imagine that would be super painful. I used a heating pad, but was never sure about how cold would react with it. Yea painkillers don't touch my hs pain either at all.
2544 2018-05-10 19:43:18 ヌルッとお見通しだ！
2545 2018-05-10 19:43:12 Just googling rectal oil absorption as you do...... 
(if you’re interested, it’s not absorbed well because of the fat content of oil. You’re welcome.)
2546 2018-05-10 19:43:08 Jamaican castor oil works wonders
2547 2018-05-10 19:42:52 Nope nothing, you just can't do it, to use a silly example, a salad with a dressing including olive oil, 2 border force checking, here Mick does this taste like Spanish olive oil to you? No don't think so Pete definitely has the nose of Moroccan due to the different soil.
2548 2018-05-10 19:42:49 and Russia wins again. High Oil prices only benefits Putin.
2549 2018-05-10 19:42:38 Howey Politics IN commentary: President Trump's cancelling the Iran nuke deal is now poised to significantly raise oil prices. Which world leader would stand by benefit most? And does he reside in the Kremlin?
2550 2018-05-10 19:42:30 Of course. Putin needs to sell some oil.
2551 2018-05-10 19:42:28 Bulshiting fans with FFP fairy tailes, project youth, english core & oil money. Selling best players, buying flops, endless excuses not once blaiming himself.
2552 2018-05-10 19:42:27 Always love to read Installer articles and I'm sure this is a good one. But I don't need to read it as with all due respect to its author oil is a much more practical choice for rural customers, especially the elderly. @OFTEC

2555 2018-05-10 19:42:22 Ya you could violently steal their oil, and make a profit for oil companies. They would maybe reduce gas prices.. MAYBE.. Probably keep the profit though.
2556 2018-05-10 19:42:19 The goal if his Iran activity was to destabilize the middle east in order to ramp up oil prices, which Putin benefits from.  The money always tells the story.
2557 2018-05-10 19:42:19 waited all winter to pick the sage, add to chilli/oil and garlic and chuck some pasta in there..summer on a fork
2558 2018-05-10 19:42:13 Lesson learned: no matter how convenient don’t get your tires rotated at an oil change/quick repair place. 2 days later I hear a light thumping that is in time with my speed. Turns out ALL FOUR of my tires were loose.
2559 2018-05-10 19:42:06 Oil, even the offshore workers here wish for war to get a larger paycheck. Sad way to live.
2560 2018-05-10 19:42:01 Congress was briefed on the programs.
Where was pushback then, now you want to relitigate the past? 
Some of you were there then.
2561 2018-05-10 19:41:59 Basta oil siya eh. Hahaha.
2562 2018-05-10 19:41:53 Withdrawal from the Iran treaty a true gift to #Putin’s ailing economy with oil prices now spiking. #Trump’s foreign policy should be called “Make Russia Great Again”
2563 2018-05-10 19:41:39 My bf keep talking about how he gone change my oil, my shit two months overdue, I’d be better off paying someone or doing it myself. Slow ass.
2564 2018-05-10 19:41:32 PLEAD THE FIFTH : like this and I’ll dm you a question and quote this tweet with an honest answer or say I plead the fifth lets play just cause i’m bored waiting for my oil to be changed
2565 2018-05-10 19:41:27 Oil at $100 Is a Possibility Next Year, Bank of America Says - Bloomberg
2566 2018-05-10 19:41:21 I LOVE me some Midnight Oil. A band in which the sum is truly greater than the parts.
2567 2018-05-10 19:41:13 If you knew the real reason for trashinging the Iran Nuke deal was probably orchestrated byPutin to get the price of oil up, it would make sense.
2568 2018-05-10 19:41:00 Your immune system works in between the cells...not cell to cell

Oil inflammes the cells blocking the immune system flow

When the system can not fully flow, undeveloped cells form !

That is called CANCER !!

Undevelpoled cells form quicker then full cells...eating more sugar
2569 2018-05-10 19:41:00 Remember -scarce on the oil-
2570 2018-05-10 19:41:00 So you implement a carbon tax on the oil producers and kill any investment in our oil fields.
Companies are tripping over themselves to get out of Alberta.
Plus you pile on record debt that is going to kill this province for years to come.
Good bye NDP

2572 2018-05-10 19:40:49 Ryan, you need to just give it up and buy a feeder. Black oil sunflower seed with a little bit of sunflower chips & safflower thrown in. Or you can go the hummingbird route for the summer. Try eBird. (I know you draw beautiful pics of birds, so you prob do all this.)
2573 2018-05-10 19:40:44 I don’t have a skin care routine. But after seeing Sarah Jessica Parker’s face I vow to always take make-up off before bed and to  put on jojoba oil.
2574 2018-05-10 19:40:41 One can’t but if you expose yourself, it’s a done deal.
So where’s the problem, why the need for government intervention, just use the one that matches what’s in your pants, no issue.
Duh.

2578 2018-05-10 19:40:26 $50 for an oil change  damn. Hate i can’t go to Walmart nomore.
2579 2018-05-10 19:40:26 Are they warning you about something or trying to sell you "Fresh Oil!"?
2580 2018-05-10 19:40:24 @BBC6Music @marcrileydj  You mentioned inferior pressings of Sorrow, I do know that REbel Rebel in Feb 74 was pressed in the US and imported because of the oil crisis. Does this help?
2581 2018-05-10 19:40:21 Indeed, if the nutcases of all descriptions had not prevailed, the tech would be so advanced, immune as it is from footdragging by oil/coal interests, that harmless thorium might be driving those clean nuclear plants!

2589 2018-05-10 19:39:45 Oil based weathershield is the best on the market by far, the water based is to thin
2590 2018-05-10 19:39:30 Tea tree oil. Epsom salts. Witch hazel help ease. So do porridge oats in the bath (muslin bag of course )
Mine is mostly hormone based. I'm trying hrt which is making hs worse. Might need to change brand. Painkillers don't seem to touch the pain either!
2591 2018-05-10 19:39:21 The Kinder Morgan pipeline carrying dirty tar sands oil would be a step backward in our efforts to solve the climate crisis.

2596 2018-05-10 19:39:13 Today's negative impact of climate change has been caused by oil pollution at sea which has to be reduced significantly, without compromising the increasing trend of energy demand. We have potentials of innovative research but not funding.

2604 2018-05-10 19:38:25 Blah, blah, blah. Meanwhile...Russian state run news is thanking Trump for pulling out of the Iran deal why? Because now they can make billions on selling Russian oil. Maybe FOX news could do some reporting on this?

2609 2018-05-10 19:37:40 We're progressing from plastics, the oil and gas industry is not used in pharmacueticals. The world already has too much plastic and the future needs to be recycling not producing more
2610 2018-05-10 19:37:33 SURPRISE! Now everyone in the Middle Class (including Trumpsters) can take their measly tax cut and hand over their money to the Russians, in the form of higher oil and gas prices. Get it now?

There’s nothing wrong with hitting you at 9% but you qualify for 6% and negotiate down. 
It kills the car biz when everyone is upside down 
It’s fine as it is
2613 2018-05-10 19:37:17 Russians'  involvement in  world politics especially in Europe ,Asia , US   and middle East is inflicting danger as it self positions in interference of many countries determination of leaders  spreading money ,oil ,corruption and fake news to rule the world ,a key Trump ally now

2616 2018-05-10 19:36:39 He’s not wrong because the situation you stated are extreme circumstances. Under your highly suspect example if we bomb Iran and take over their oil fields then oil go down?? Nothing this President will ever do will satisfy you short of vacating the Presidency

2620 2018-05-10 19:36:19 Oil gets into your blood stream 7 makes it thick

it sticks and clogs arteries, it make your heart work 10 times as hard and causes inlargement

Oil will not dilute the items in the blood and takes up waters space

It reduces the oxygen in your blood causing strokes & alzhiemers
2621 2018-05-10 19:35:56 Oil goes up another two bits, reaching $71.39.
2622 2018-05-10 19:35:53 Here’s interesting, if obvious observation, about olive trees. Not only are there olive trees still living that pre-date the Bible, olive oil was one of the first lamp oils—giving olive trees a fun connection with fire.
2623 2018-05-10 19:35:52 From what I’ve heard about the 70s the soap and the food were pretty much indistinguishable anyway. I’ve just tried Googling ‘famous cooking oil brands 1970s’ and it came up with a Duckhams advert.

2628 2018-05-10 19:35:11 oil prices were dropping. Gas will increase
2629 2018-05-10 19:35:09 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
Oil isn't worth shit until refined.
And guess who is the largest refiner? The US of A!
Plus, those are high paying jobs and a resource the US can harness domestically at sustainable rates.
Oil is not a simple S&D commodity.
2630 2018-05-10 19:35:07 Holy oil too 
2631 2018-05-10 19:35:07 When your country’s politicians stops propagating hate throughout the rest of the world, and especially where the petrodollar is worthless, or oil has been discovered, then the rest of the world will stop criticising it.  Our politicians are as bad.  We keep criticising them too!
2632 2018-05-10 19:35:06 1. Mix a lil Apple cider vinegar and Aztec clay (every other week) 2. Applying small amount of shea butter at night (has good healing properties) 3. Aloe Vera and honey mask (every week) 4. Thayers Rose water toner (apply day and night) 5. Jojoba oil(morning)
2633 2018-05-10 19:35:03 Mr Gore, Please focus on enacting USA policies so that allies  like Canada can work on even footing.  Otherwise it appears your efforts are specific to limit Canada and only intended to assist  increasing USA oil production and higher market share for OPEC.
2634 2018-05-10 19:34:57 Hy I am using the serum , my question is after bathing either at night or morning my skin is sooo dry and I would use oil but it penetrates through my skin. 2-4 hours later my skin is dry again. Should I apply the oil when skin gets dry?
2635 2018-05-10 19:34:48 To save the high seas, in turn the coastal areas, oil pollution at sea has to be reduced significantly, without compromising the increasing trend of energy demand. We have potentials of innovation but not funding.

2639 2018-05-10 19:34:32 Tea tree oil is super good, it moisturizes and also helps get rid of acne
2640 2018-05-10 19:34:30 Israel attacked first! It's not their land! Only reason they hold on to it is cuz of oil.. look up genie energy's owners and everything will become clear...
2641 2018-05-10 19:34:20 You mean the oil revenues of Scotland.
2642 2018-05-10 19:34:06 Lagos only started receiving oil money very recently. I stand to be corrected. Lagos is the commercial capital of Nigeria. Hope that explains how Lagos is making its money.
2643 2018-05-10 19:33:53 I don’t get the hype around double cleansing (cleansing oil or balm + water based cleanser) it always leaves my skin super raw and irritated, and I don’t get breakouts or anything bad when I just remove makeup with micellar water and then use cleansing foam
2644 2018-05-10 19:33:52 I try to avoid Palm oil when shopping but it's tricky. If only we could work some multi national regulations in this area...
2645 2018-05-10 19:33:37 interesting thought..!!
India can buy oil from Russia..so don’t have any moral turpitude about buying a good car..
After all, you live only Once..
2646 2018-05-10 19:33:33 Before gently moving them into the middle of the pan and gently flicking the oil over the top of the eggs until they looked cooked. 

Then she took them from the pan using the spatula and placing them on a plate "Did you see everything honey?"
2647 2018-05-10 19:33:27 I assume the US will like to jump in there too. Specially since the transoceans of the world need oil at $65 or higher to produce. I guess this means short term, if demand stays the same, oil will go even higher, right?
2648 2018-05-10 19:33:27 CBD oil is definitely helping
2649 2018-05-10 19:33:26 As I mentioned, I was all out of oil last week. Seeing some others making the move now. Where is the money rotating? My guess...growth.
2650 2018-05-10 19:33:24 $FCEL so is Toyota the middle man between FCEL and Shell Oil?
2651 2018-05-10 19:33:10 I’m not a conservative.

Next...
2652 2018-05-10 19:33:04 Sounds like a fabulous recipe for explosive diarrhea...well done snake oil pedlar!
2653 2018-05-10 19:33:03 Prevalence reflects genetic susceptibilities too - so be careful inferring based on that. But overall it's epidemic everywhere. Veg oil, sugars and refined carbs, exacerbated in some by inactivity issues, and a few more factors. Lack of healthy body sun exposure won't help... 
2654 2018-05-10 19:32:57 “There’s a possibility that oil could rally to $100 a barrel by next year” says Bank of America. Oil prices have not touched a $100 since 2014.
2655 2018-05-10 19:32:27 People so paranoid. 

" The military is still in the middle East because they got oil "

Girl don't worry, I just bought a whole damn bottle of vegetable oil and not one soldier has kicked down my door.
2656 2018-05-10 19:32:25 Jesus, Davis. Tarp, baby oil, and hose??? Who you expecting to bring home from City Limits tonight?!
2657 2018-05-10 19:32:17 You’re on a subject I could care less about.
Is this the only way you know how to debate the 2nd amendment?
You really suck at this.
2658 2018-05-10 19:32:12 Alexander Ivanov at the meeting in a subsidiary of the Chinese Oil Corporation: USMILE - the world's largest network of petrol stations and retail stores. We have been interested in drone logistics for a long time. Glad to meet him.

2659 2018-05-10 19:32:06 We did that in oil and gas industry to map the 3d earth model in order to figure out where to optimally place wells.  So people would have 3D glasses and could immerse themselves in the formations.
2660 2018-05-10 19:31:56 People did not eat oil until the late 1800s

In the bible there was a 3 year drought & a woman mixed some oil with flour to make it stick

You use oil to light lamps, use as a topical solution or unsqueeky wheels

If you want to end your pains and live..STOP EATING OIL

The TRUTH
2661 2018-05-10 19:31:56 Gentlemen, to me it appears that if the IRI can transform its oil based economy and satisfy its energy demands, it seems that at least half the IRI's (public) case for the nuclear program would disappear. It's a huge problem but one that seems to have solutions.
2662 2018-05-10 19:31:35 No, ‘Osrael’ is trying to steal land because it is rich in important and valuable assets, such as fresh water and oil & gas. It’s not a noble cause, it’s just land grabs. Idiots like you may think it’s noble, but it’s just tyrannical theft.
2663 2018-05-10 19:31:20 Cut ginger in small pieces and Saute it with little salt and without oil till it becomes light brown...chew it ...very effective for throat
2664 2018-05-10 19:31:10 Now that the US is energy independent that means the money will stay here and not the Middle East. It will mean even more good paying jobs in the oil field
2665 2018-05-10 19:31:05 I am breathing oil :)
2666 2018-05-10 19:31:01 Vision, leadership and oil.
2667 2018-05-10 19:30:59 That makes no sense.  Iran is a Russia ally and oil crashed due to the US shale boom. It's a loss only for globalists and brainwashed liberals
2668 2018-05-10 19:30:56 I enjoy seeing these fabulous automobiles. But I can't afford the oil change. 
2669 2018-05-10 19:30:45 Irrelevant to the conversation.
2670 2018-05-10 19:30:45 $70 Oil is good for Texas. Thousands of high paying jobs will be created. The PROFIT will ripple thruout Texas. 
#DrillBabyDrill #PermianBasin
2671 2018-05-10 19:30:43 @realDonaldTrump please lean on other oil countries to keep fuel prices low, the economy will crash if energy costs rise. Small businesses are already struggling from Obama care & insurance costs out of control
2672 2018-05-10 19:30:38 I'm more concerned with the fact that if they build this it will LITERALLY KILL PEOPLE.

Helicopters are already a rotating mass of metal fatigue surrounded by an oil leak looking for a nice spot to have an NTSB investigation.
This is a giant "HEY HELICOPTERS! CRASH HERE!" sign.
2673 2018-05-10 19:30:36 my mom paid for my car to get washed, and an oil change. I love her with all my heart
2674 2018-05-10 19:30:31 One thing Mr President that I implore you to bring from Qatar is an investment in building an oil refinery. We will address all the issues surrounding fuel, bitumen for roads, electricity and a significant number of jobs being created. Please look into that line of investment.

Parties to the historic deal agreed to curtail
2677 2018-05-10 19:30:07 Until you cook the hell out of it with natural gas, water, and additives and then hydrogenate it, it's just tar thats full of sand. #tarsands
Oil sands is just Alberta's version of politically correct.
2678 2018-05-10 19:29:56 You made the claim about oil consumption rising in the Lower Mainland, not me. I simply asked that you provide evidence to back your claim. Again this has nothing to do with indigenous title over traditional territories. #cdnpoli
2679 2018-05-10 19:29:54 Crude oil prices approaching USD80 !
2680 2018-05-10 19:29:52 When the global price goes up for crude oil it's unfair to expect prices in SL to remain same. Only illiterate will expect that
2681 2018-05-10 19:29:51 That is old
2682 2018-05-10 19:29:45 Ali, how can you talk about the "why's" and not mention the oil?!?!? This is always going to be about controlling the massive oil field in the Golan Heights. Everyone needs to Google "Genie Energy" and look at who has a stake in it.

2690 2018-05-10 19:29:00 Are we talking about USA's *fairly convinced assumptions*or about *convincing arguments* over Irak's nuke armament then &crashing the Iran Nuke deal now,to justify direct and indirect aggression against them?

Amongst oth Oil: Who in US &RU will profit from improved RU oil trade?
2691 2018-05-10 19:28:56 I’m looking at it but not sure how I feel about the oil since my skin tends towards combo. What do you think?
2692 2018-05-10 19:28:49 Remember? During campaign Trump said take their oil he probably have a plan with Putin for Iran with Netanyahu, more to it than he claim bad Iran deal,looking to start a war in Middle East, Stay Awake

2696 2018-05-10 19:28:09 EOG Resources is nicknamed the Apple of Oil.
2697 2018-05-10 19:28:06 Oil back at $70 and your best investment is share buybacks?

WTF
2698 2018-05-10 19:28:05 2-3 times per week depends, shea moisture products like the leave in conditioner. I Use coconut oil too & deep condition once a week

2700 2018-05-10 19:28:02 I miss having my windshield cleaned, my tires and oil checked.  I thought it was a great service.  I especially liked the self serve/full serve option.
2701 2018-05-10 19:27:58 tea tree oil! every one says to dilute it w other oils but i never do and it gets rid of any pimples
2702 2018-05-10 19:27:50 pumpkin seed oil, sweet almond, eucalyptus, patchouli
2703 2018-05-10 19:27:47 Trump needs a war in the Middle East.  His boss Putin needs oil at about $100.00 / barrel to get the Russian economy back on track.  And I am sure if you look close enough you will find Trump and his family heavily invested in oil as well.
2704 2018-05-10 19:27:42 I've seen a Tweet recently about a Russian government TV show, where they had the question how Putin plans to finance some things. "USA withdraws from Iran deal, Russian Oil price will go up - that's how". Live on TV the day Trump announced his decision.
2705 2018-05-10 19:27:32 just ordered rosehip oil and ritz chips for store pickup and they were ready in under an hour truly #blessed with the power of #tech
2706 2018-05-10 19:27:30 Oil is causing CANCER, ARTHRITUS, LUPUS, FIBROMIALGA, BULDGING DISC, PARKINSONS, LOU GARRETS, HEART DESEASE, ECT ECT

OIL does NOT dilute the chemicals, sugars, salts & other toxins you ingest.

ALL conscentates are seen as TOXINS TO THE BODY.

They cause INFLAMMATION and you die
2707 2018-05-10 19:27:30 Is there oil money ? 
2708 2018-05-10 19:27:20 Hell yeah it is, just keep topping off the oil. Who needs oil changes when it gives it to itself? Lmao
2709 2018-05-10 19:26:55 @realDonaldTrump I hope you’re going to do something about #oil #gasoline because they are soaring through the roof, while the Big 3 automakers announcing a resuction in car manufacturing to focus on suvs and trucks.  First step towards the next recession.
2710 2018-05-10 19:26:51 Damn #sainsburys has realised that the groundnut oil in the ethnic isle is cheaper than their own brand and stopped selling it.
2711 2018-05-10 19:26:22 Twice...I'm a corner cutter wherever poss. No corner cutting with this. I even fooled some non vegans when it was mixed with oil & balsamic
2712 2018-05-10 19:26:18 Poor thing. I suspect the teacher did not ask for permission to confiscate phone. Obviously Teacher's at fault here.
2713 2018-05-10 19:26:12 That electric car was made with oil. Every single piece of it.

You stated that, "Okanogan (sp) isn't all of BC..." which shows you think that Okanagan tourism is trivial.
2714 2018-05-10 19:26:06 Also, it’s that left that uses people’s history.
What kind of crack are you on anyways?
2715 2018-05-10 19:26:03 You'll use thousands to pay higher fuel costs b/c China is abandoning $US denominated oil purchases & oil prices spiked after Iran deal isolates the region.

You're not winning, but can cover those costs. Congrats, asshole.
2716 2018-05-10 19:25:55 Tanked our oil industry? Really!?! You like $147.50 pb oil? If anything it refined our non conventional oil industry of course GOP is already hard at work driving the price way back up have to be blind to not see that coming
2717 2018-05-10 19:25:36 Just discovered (on twitter) that you can remove make up with coconut oil.

I tried it.

What am I gonna do with all this free time?  im so happy!!!
2718 2018-05-10 19:25:35 Pretty sure whataboutery isn't a word. We didn't spend it, the ukgov spent it, look to other scandanavian countries who set up oil funds and use these to make a more equal society
2719 2018-05-10 19:25:22 Bingo! Oil price has been anorexic for some time now, and Putin is burning cash in Syria and needs oil price to lift above $80/bbl so his buddy pays him back by blocking Iranian oil from the market. The EU should grow some balls and keep Iran oil flowing, WMD wolf pt II.
2720 2018-05-10 19:25:21 The main issue w/ the NFL is... cost. $20 just to leave a few oil spots on the parking lot at Arrowhead- come on!... the tickets, concessions, accessories- all through the roof! The NFL gets away w/ highway robbery just because they can. We'll see how long this continues...
2721 2018-05-10 19:25:18 GOOD she's repulsive she can stand alone.  People in Germany voted her in even though she doesn't give a shyt about them. Shes ruined Germany and she's buying oil from Russia then complains about them. Pathetic
2722 2018-05-10 19:25:18 It's all about the oil and money. Both needs to be in jail.
2723 2018-05-10 19:25:03 But you can insult Alberta and the oil sands? Our main source of energy, income and prosperity?
2724 2018-05-10 19:25:00 I hate it when my mom cooks with Palm Oil

That gaping thing there, wow, you could drive an oil tanker in there..Does he think if he's LOUD, his lies will be believed?! Nice try, Bozo, we have your #
2726 2018-05-10 19:24:41 Is grapeseed oil considered safe?
2727 2018-05-10 19:24:35 I’d prefer that irrational leftists knock off their offspring.

That plain enough for you?
2728 2018-05-10 19:24:31 the contrast between the oil paint and acrylic paint makes me... feel things
2729 2018-05-10 19:24:21 Many cover, dark skin means need more exposure - and sun ain't gonna help you much if you on sugar, refined carb & veg oil brew... 
2730 2018-05-10 19:24:16 79% of electricity generation by hydro power, which unfortunately disrupts wildlife and affects the river’s ecosystem. Electricity is -by the way- a small part of Costa Rica’s total energy consumption. Oil takes a 70% share...Just to offer some context.
2731 2018-05-10 19:24:15 I’ve done the beard twice, and if I’ve learned anything it’s to let the barber shop handle all of the maintenance. Over time trying things on my own ended up chopping it to pieces. Wash and condition every day, Beard oil!
2732 2018-05-10 19:24:12 Mr Murdoch is drilling for oil there. What else did you expect...?
2733 2018-05-10 19:24:12 So when TRUMP took office, Opec & RUSSIA CUT THEIR production of oil!

More oil flowing, BETTER prices for consumers.
CUTS, drive the barrels of oil UP.  Cost PASSED to consumers!
President Obama TOOK efforts to Wing America of off the BLACK GOLD!
TRUMP friends makes HUGE profits
2734 2018-05-10 19:24:10 #Israel occupies Syrian land.
Israel is stealing Syrian oil out of the land it occupies.
Israel has been giving AlQaeda medical aid out of the land it stole. 
Israel has launched 100 unprovoked attacks against #Syria.
When #Syria retaliates, #Israel acts like the victim.
2735 2018-05-10 19:24:10 Cocoa Butter and Coconut Oil are really the best inventions of all time
2736 2018-05-10 19:24:04 Got olive oil on my cotton dress at lunch, and I'm worried the stain will never come put because I can't treat it til I get home. 
2737 2018-05-10 19:24:02 BS is America promotes democracy there,uses it as an excuse to invade. Those people need to choose it on their own if it is to work.Every1 here says it's "for the oil" but that's insane. We pay market price for oil purchases, it'd be 𝘧𝘢𝘳 cheaper to get oil in more stable areas
2738 2018-05-10 19:24:01 What is going to give me cancer faster, the chemicals in the oil I vape or the tobacco in the blunts I smoke?
2739 2018-05-10 19:23:54 The discussion is a long one. It is a discussion on how oil money has been used to develop Lagos over the years which I personally have a dissenting view
2740 2018-05-10 19:23:52 To save the high seas, in turn the coastal areas, oil pollution at sea has to be reduced significantly, without compromising the increasing trend of energy demand. We have potentials but not funding.
2741 2018-05-10 19:23:49 With fallout you know at least why everything is like it is. A great war between nations over oil and other declining natural resources
2742 2018-05-10 19:23:43 You said I’m in charge and no one is attacking rights.

Both are blatantly false statements.
2743 2018-05-10 19:23:32 Withdrawal from the Iran treaty a true gift to #Putin’s ailing economy with oil prices now spiking. #Trump’s foreign policy should be called “Make Russia Great Again”
2744 2018-05-10 19:23:32 OMG,my 10 year old son would love this,you are his favorite driver,he got to meet and see you last year at Grandveiw Speedway he was so excited the rest of the night!!!
2745 2018-05-10 19:23:28 Russia economy was hurting in 2015 because of Oil glut. Rise in oil prices by the barrel is a quick fix.
2746 2018-05-10 19:23:23 Has #Trump just found a way to pay for Putin's sheltering him from "fake" accusations? Breaking Iran deal may give Russia $500mln a day in their oil price increase.
2747 2018-05-10 19:23:07 I write and write until I write something that I like.
2748 2018-05-10 19:23:04 Bobi: You can make me miss my locs sometimes. Is that Coconut oil or Shea butter?
2749 2018-05-10 19:23:03 Under Cheney/Bush Regime gas was 4 plus dollars/gallon. Under Obama it got down to around 2 dollars/gallon. Under the thug tRump back above 3 and climbing. So much for the lies about domestic oil production. Maybe the Koch's are buying tankers and keeping them off shore again.
2750 2018-05-10 19:23:02 Who ever said anyone can’t pee?
Seems there is a two room option everywhere for the actual genders.
You don’t get to make them up as you go and demand more, that would be ludicrous.
2751 2018-05-10 19:22:20 Republicans and Trump promised Big Oil companies huge profits for campaign donations and they are delivering
2752 2018-05-10 19:22:11 Also, the interests of the oil industry are well defended by his administration, I think, so he's definitely oleophilic too.
2753 2018-05-10 19:22:08 We can agree on that and all the scientists are leaving bc GOP elites appointed someone in the EPA who wants to shut it down environment. They'd rather take lobbyist $ from big Oil etc. polluting corporations and don't care how soon US will be under gas mask quarantine.
2754 2018-05-10 19:22:04 Slice or sunseed oil in a bowl with a 23cm non-stick frying pan, discarding the meat off the cheesy burgers and lay it along.
2755 2018-05-10 19:21:48 Why are prices rising? The US hasn’t imported Iranian oil in 25 years and we are now a net exporter of oil. This is oil company greed taking advantage of Americans!
2756 2018-05-10 19:21:45 I like Olbas Oil and it does work
2757 2018-05-10 19:21:43 Yes absolutely. India will have to cut Iranian Oil imports & even business ties wud be impacted.
2758 2018-05-10 19:21:41 My sister texted me...

Allyson: Stop being a smartass. You know I'm pregnant!

Baby Quinton might be coming earlier than expected.

2760 2018-05-10 19:21:28 @ziyatong The oil sands development has been a Canadian industrial policy for 50 years. Until someone can provide an alternative to heating my home in winter, we'll need pipelines for a long time to come. US oil production/exports increasing next 5 years, Canada 0?

2765 2018-05-10 19:21:12 @GStephanopoulos @ThisWeekABC  
"Crude oil futures have leapt from $26 at the time of Trump’s election to $77 today." Sanctions on IRAN raises oil prices DRAMATICALLY INCREASING THE PROFITS $$$ RUSSIA MAKES ON OIL SALES! Is Trump's gift to Putin being covered? Not all about Rudy!
2766 2018-05-10 19:21:06 Check the budget how much is allocated to public sector and how much is the giv spending to clean up after bankrupted oil companies. Honestly how can you be this naive?
2767 2018-05-10 19:20:56 The recycled oil on paved roads?

Your skin has a natural “sunscreen” built in. Instead, try coconut oil to hydrate said melanin before a day in the sun. You will tan still, with more of a photosynthesising of the light rather than burning.

Did Trump do this to help Putin? Looks like another covert helping hand to Russia in exchange for election help in 2016/2018.

2837 2018-05-10 19:16:33 This is a perfect example of oil companies taking advantage of Americans based upon geopolitical events. Since the early 1990s, the US has imported ZERO oil from Iran. And as of last year, the US became a net exporter of oil. So why are oil companies raising prices on Americans?

This administration is not perfect but what you can’t take away from them is the way our resources was/is been managed especially during the fall in oil price and drop in oil output
2864 2018-05-10 19:14:25 Oil prices will rise because of this.  Trump is horrible! You aren't aware of his corruption, constant lies and wrongdoings! This man is a danger to our entire planet. He's even selling off our national monuments to the highest bidders, taking money from Russia for favors.

2872 2018-05-10 19:13:49 @PackManJoel @BarryIsFunny here is maybe a positive “excuse”:  the cost of oil is up, therefore a large percentage of the pop. has a lot of disposal income. Therefore the people that buy the tix don’t care to resell when they can’t go.

2878 2018-05-10 19:13:19 Very true, but still short of the amount needed for a balanced budget. My concern is #akleg will use rising oil prices as an excuse to avoid doing the hard work necessary to establish long term fiscal stability. We cannot rely on disaster & subsequent rise in PPB to budget.

Slid up the ramp to the pits, off 2, tried to take a short jump back onto the track, caught a wheel and flipped it. It was a spectacular flip!  Huge fan ever since,  because he was driving it like he stole it!
2908 2018-05-10 19:09:38 Days after Trump leaves Iran nuclear deal , oil prices are rising and ruble is strengthening.
2909 2018-05-10 19:09:15 Thong bikinis and baby oil SZN.
2910 2018-05-10 19:09:12 Very nice can i help spread the oil
2911 2018-05-10 19:09:09 Some of today's projects. Keep in mind, we not only service transmissions, we are your "Complete Car Care Center". We are here to tackle anything from simple oil changes to complex engine and transmission rebuilding. Call us at (401) 432-7535
2912 2018-05-10 19:09:07 Obama tanked our oil industry with that deal which was uncalled for leaving our own states who depended on oil in shambles including our own Native American people who have headrights depending on that oil while Iran got richer. Obama no problem selling off our country.
2913 2018-05-10 19:08:57 Yep Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Jamnagar (they have a huge oil refinery here btw), Surat, Valsad.. their network coverage isn't appropriate anywhere nd they're working on it since eternity nd will work on it till the end of tym.... Rahul.. please co-operate  #BS
2914 2018-05-10 19:08:39 Turkish loans, Oil revenue, shared revenue, smuggling, bribes, international deals.. Where is that money now..? Can a KRG Leader explain how taking advantage of Rich oil Kirkuk revenue and Turkish loans without being able to send half a salary to Kurdish Personnel..?
2915 2018-05-10 19:08:33 I’m sorry, but I am convinced the government is pushing these bans of straws/wet wipes to convince you that it’s us that’s the problem rather than their lack of green policies or friendships with oil companies. 
2916 2018-05-10 19:08:13 the most recent bank report shows lower loan demand in every category w/ rising delinquencies. How is higher oil and higher rates on a broke consumer going to help consumer spend? There was and is no normal in mrkts anymore. Just mu opinion to this normal call.

2920 2018-05-10 19:07:49 I use coconut oil too it helps quite a bit! I’ll check out the other one too, thanks!
2921 2018-05-10 19:07:47 @jannarden The land reclamation done by oil companies where "oil sands not tar sands" once were have left the land in better shape and created eco systems for plants and animals that are thriving in those areas ..your suggestion of land destruction by oil companies is uneducated
2922 2018-05-10 19:07:38 Cadillac grills, Cadillac thrills, check out the oil my Cadillac spills
2923 2018-05-10 19:07:32 Im going to avoid palm oil products so that your rainforests stay intact and it’s inhabitants aren’t forced to leave their homes 
2924 2018-05-10 19:07:30 Rising oil price is good for Iran too, no matter any sanctions.

You like many others thought that

1: Mediterranean countries being doing it for centuries

2: How do olives survive & thrive in heat

3: This & many other studies back up you can cook with Extra Virgin Olive Oil

4: Mrs Oil does & I ain't arguing with her

2927 2018-05-10 19:07:18 The agony and ecstasy of discovering you have a packet of Jaffa cakes when you're awake and peckish at 5am, then realising they have Palm Oil in and you will never again be able to enjoy them without destroying the rainforest and driving orang-utans closer to extinction.
2928 2018-05-10 19:06:57 I had a stomach bug couple of weeks ago and thought my immune system just went down, but it looks like others are effected badly, too. The new scent of my room is Olbas oil and I’m not joking. Otherwise I wouldn’t be able to sleep.
2929 2018-05-10 19:06:52 Crude oil recovering today, and for the most part, the oil stocks are not. That's been the story of the last two years. There's gonna be a major reckoning, in my humble opinion, and some of these energy names are going to go for a RIP.
2930 2018-05-10 19:06:51 @wapo "Crude oil futures have leapt from $26 at the time of Trump’s election to $77 today." Sanctions on Iran raises oil prices DRAMATICALLY INCREASING THE PROFITS $$$ RUSSIA MAKES ON OIL SALES! Have you thoroughly analyzed this Trump favor to Russia?
2931 2018-05-10 19:06:48 Yes it's assnine. They would be dipping our guys in hot oil, and Dem worried about waterbording. They can drown them as far as I'm concerned!

2937 2018-05-10 19:06:17 And I'm tired of people saying "those people" have been fighting since biblical times.  They had no more conflicts than Europe or Asia before oil was found there and Europeans wanted to win control from the Ottomans.
2938 2018-05-10 19:06:17 Cook with extra virgin olive oil, the healthiest fat on the planet! High in heart-healthy monounsaturated fats and antioxidants which can help fight painful inflammation! #HealthTips

My mom: ok awesome you need to go to the dentist, the doctor, get a haircut, get your oil changed, tires rotated, retake your drivers test, write a 10 page paper about your experience being home
2940 2018-05-10 19:06:04 108. Ben Coes' "Power Down" (Dewey Andreas #1). Great debut!! Mr. Andreas isn't a typical action hero at first--he's in charge of an oil rig--but his SEAL+Delta background comes in handy when he blazes a trail of brutal revenge. Excellent terrorist-targeting-infrastructure plot.
2941 2018-05-10 19:06:01 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!
2942 2018-05-10 19:05:57 Too much oil in a unnu back and it a show.
2943 2018-05-10 19:05:53 Meanwhile there are your so-called "dirty tar sands" oil deposits in Eastern Utah being developed.  Why is that Mr. Gore?  Why aren't you protesting this in your own country?

2953 2018-05-10 19:05:07 I’ve been trying to find a solution, fish oil seems to help a lot I’ve noticed, but he’s still stiff. He’s my boy though, I’d carry him up and down stairs and put him on couches and beds forever. It’s the least I could do.

2957 2018-05-10 19:04:53 That's how Argan oil is obtained....
2958 2018-05-10 19:04:38 They were mostly made of light and delicate metals, now all bent and torn and rusted and smeared in their own oil, and she could only guess what sort of legendary creatures they had once been - gear-dogs, prototype horses, steam fish.

2963 2018-05-10 19:04:23 U cannot reduce the efforts of this government to just the prices of commodities or things. 

There are different factors u need to put into consideration... 
Recession is one of them, oil prices. 

With time, these prices will come further down....
2964 2018-05-10 19:04:20 $3.19, $3.29 in Chicago. We hadn't seen anything close to $3.00 under Obama for years. It's not just Iran. It's sabotaging fuel standards, clean energy investment. Oil cos. know competition is being destroyed under DT/GOP.
2965 2018-05-10 19:04:16 Not sure if I misplaced my tea tree oil package or if I've lost it 
2966 2018-05-10 19:04:14 @GlobalNational all corporate polluters need to be fined from the oil sands to the American corporation's that poison .....
2967 2018-05-10 19:04:08 Man, my grandma accidentally spilt hot oil all over my right foot and tried blaming it on my big brother. I was only 3 years old and he was five &I definitely not even tall enough to grab the pan.

2970 2018-05-10 19:03:55 I 100% always spray my grill down with oil - thank you for the tip! I’ve grilled all sorts of fish before just never big beautiful swordfish steaks
2971 2018-05-10 19:03:53 Tea tree oil is literally amazing. Like you have a zit...tea tree oil. You have an irritated piercing...tea tree oil. You want some beautiful hair..tea tree oil. You trying to wash/ disinfect your makeup brushes..TEA TREE OIL BITCH 
2972 2018-05-10 19:03:43 You think that C02 is the culprit. it's not profitable for you to be logical. Perhaps pure true science and seeing Canada is not the problem but the foreign countries lack of controls. Like the ones we buy oil from? China? India? manufacturing. Punish Canadians with politburo.
2973 2018-05-10 19:03:40 War? Why do that? Just bleed them economically. As they are now spread thin in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen, cut their oil money off they won't be able to afford a Dr. Pepper.
2974 2018-05-10 19:03:31 I'm guessing it's not gonna be long before we see @RyanJonesOnline as the mystery guest on @QuestionofSport selling at @gowericecream, to be fair @ShaneWilliams11 was on there delivering oil! #topmarketing #buywelsh

2982 2018-05-10 19:02:39 Just don't let it sit too long, it will stick real fast. Brush a little vegetable oil on the grill before you place it down.. 10 mins tops, 4 mins one side.. It comes off sooooo tender.

2994 2018-05-10 19:01:43 just took out my frustration at getting called by wodd tenzel assuming they were asking to buy my car again when it was just their service department offering a discount on an oil change. i feel like an ass.
2995 2018-05-10 19:01:43 So Billy Hill is offering 100/1 on the oil cunts and Swansea scoring 10 uncontested goals between them. I'd be tempted, but even though it's 'lads it's mark hughes' the berts always stop bothering when they get to 5

.Trump’s action in pulling out of the Iran deal makes sense primarily as a trillion-dollar gift to Putin (by boosting Russia’s take from the oil market) in exchange for Putin’s many favors to Trump — like helping him win the presidency

3022 2018-05-10 18:59:24 you should always and forever use & abuse coconut oil. But during these summer months... it is ESSENTIAL for moisturizers/glowing skin. Trust sis. Shower in it. Eat it. Marry it.
3023 2018-05-10 18:59:17 Amazon does great things, like employ a ton of people and pay them well, and she tries to sell that company as Seattle’s biggest enemy. I remember her going after Wells Fargo to protest the ND oil pipeline on Seattle taxpayer time. What a joke.
3024 2018-05-10 18:59:10 Oh yes, as our water and air get polluted again. Price of gas goes up and his buddies decide it’s time to drill for more oil in our backyards as well as the coastlines and Artic wildlife refuge. Tax cuts, LOL, not in my tax bracket.
3025 2018-05-10 18:59:03 metals .oil is up bit but it seems that big rally is slowing . To sum everthing seems fine for the market apart from  politics . (2/2)

That said they're SO cheap (it's crazy), and I think they're due for the next leg up pretty soon.
3034 2018-05-10 18:58:10 Remember the $25 a week Americans got from the tax scam... now that goes into the gas tank and back to big oil. You knew they would find a way to get it all.

3038 2018-05-10 18:57:55 I was just changing the oil in my car and a 900mph wind gust came through and almost bodied me
3039 2018-05-10 18:57:41 Thought cooking with extra virgin olive oil was a complete no no.
3040 2018-05-10 18:57:37 @CNN @CNNPolitics @jaketapper "Crude oil futures have leapt from $26 at the time of Trump’s election to $77 today." Sanctions on Iran raises oil prices DRAMATICALLY INCREASING THE PROFITS $$$ RUSSIA MAKES ON OIL SALES! Has this been thoroughly covered?

3043 2018-05-10 18:57:23 Eat some gulf shrimp! They probably aren’t still contaminated from that enormous oil spill....
3044 2018-05-10 18:57:21 Finally done with class and one of my classmates gave me fresh olive oil. What a good day 
3045 2018-05-10 18:57:13 I love to watch 30 minute meals to see what Jamie Oliver is going knock up to accompany olive oil

3047 2018-05-10 18:57:06 I am not the best about doing tire rotations either. I usually do 10,000 miles on oil changes
3048 2018-05-10 18:57:04 Oil pump. Flickering oil light, comes and goes. Mine went on me in February and like a donut I drove it home causing more damage.
3049 2018-05-10 18:57:00 Not to mention the Saudi’s oil
3050 2018-05-10 18:56:57 small doses to add that flavor is fine. too much of it is no good. just like any oil!
3051 2018-05-10 18:56:33 That was obvious right from the bat, I even suggested it before the pull out. Its again: about oil. That fucking liquid is responsible for soooo much misery.
3052 2018-05-10 18:56:28 That was my worry so thought na I’d sooner pay for the oil lol. Shame they don’t let you test them first
3053 2018-05-10 18:56:27 Just spent six harrowing hours syringing gallon after gallon of whale oil into my own urethra!
3054 2018-05-10 18:56:26 Pero, escuchame. Oil debe 19000mill de mangos. Qué pretendés? Que le condone la deuda?
3055 2018-05-10 18:56:25 I’ve made this very comparison before on tech becoming the next oil industry. The question here is: who can we really trust to curate accurate news?
3056 2018-05-10 18:56:06 Shame none of the oil boiler manufacturers attended @Installer_Show but good to see Oftec there.
3057 2018-05-10 18:56:05 Wow you get your oil from the Middle East and your EPA administration has removed all environmental regulations.  Why don’t you focus on your own backyard which is way more overgrown than ours and leave  alone.

3059 2018-05-10 18:55:43 You gotta put a little olive oil and oregano on it and cook it first before you put everything else on and give it the high heat.

3064 2018-05-10 18:55:23 Don’t forget Putin. Russia will make a ton of money off of higher oil prices which helps Putin’s goals. But the gop seems ok with helping Putin
3065 2018-05-10 18:55:14 That's it. The decision was based on increasing Putin's and Russia's oil profits.
3066 2018-05-10 18:55:12 The best monetary idea Kiir could have! He needs to stop the war and pilferage..utilize oil $ wisely.

3075 2018-05-10 18:54:44 IMHO, Trump has no strategy whatsoever and is being played by Netanyahu and others; profiting from arms sales and rise in oil price simply a collateral consequence.
3076 2018-05-10 18:54:42 As long as they feed off tainted oil money, then they’ll never have legends or respect for that matter

3083 2018-05-10 18:54:01 Dude, the intent of the deal was to not let Iran have nuclear weapons, it worked. Now nobody will trust ANY of our deals & we’ve alienated our allies. What did we gain? More expensive oil, no ability to monitor Iran’s nukes, lost trust internationally, etc.
3084 2018-05-10 18:54:00 IRAN is selling oil TI Europe, you EMBECILE.

3099 2018-05-10 18:52:44 Why you rub oil for breast ?
3100 2018-05-10 18:52:36 Yea the atty general should have oil company’s explain collusion and price manipulation to as why gas is rising
3101 2018-05-10 18:52:35 Forgot about the fish oil pill in my pocket and it leaked. What a pleasant smell.
3102 2018-05-10 18:52:29 Unless Israel bombs the oil targets!

3105 2018-05-10 18:52:19 Can I open a class action suit against King County for utterly wasting millions in tax revenue on things their constituents neither needed nor wanted? Seems much more feasible than suing an oil company for the public's inability to interpret obvious data.
3106 2018-05-10 18:52:13 Legal weed’s amazing like hmm am I in a sativa or indica mood? Blue dream or space oddity? Or maybe I’ll just rip my skywalker oil pen like I have so many options. And cheap too
3107 2018-05-10 18:52:08 As Dr. D knows: In & Out cuts their potatoes fresh (never frozen) right into the fryer.They are then dumped onto a clean white towel and shaken so that excess oil is removed.
3108 2018-05-10 18:52:08 Trump’s action in pulling out of the Iran deal makes sense primarily as a trillion-dollar gift to Putin (by boosting Russia’s take from the oil market) in exchange for Putin’s many favors to Trump — like helping him win the presidency and indirectly bailing him out of his debts.
3109 2018-05-10 18:52:06 I put baby oil instead of lotion today and man, what a difference lol
3110 2018-05-10 18:52:05 I’m not an Oiler but my Oiler friend gifted me clove oil and i diluted with coconut oil and rubbed on Linc. It’s disgusting but it numbs them up nicely!
3111 2018-05-10 18:51:46 Ah! The eloquent reply of some one who has just heard something they don’t want to hear. The company was my company, we made oil less compressors for recovering CFC’s Halons and refrigerant gasses. We lost an order of 1000 units due to turn down of export licence from EU
3112 2018-05-10 18:51:36 So I can confirm physio is nothing like a massage.. here's me thinking it was just like a massage with no lavender oil.. I'm bitterly disappointed.. #delusional #inagony

3122 2018-05-10 18:50:58 In order for turmeric to be effective, it needs butter, coconut oil, or some other fat to dissolve correctly so your body can absorb it.  
Second, turmeric‘s active ingredient, curcumin, is more available to the body when combined with black pepper, about a 9:1 ratio.
3123 2018-05-10 18:50:55 I used coconut oil for lotion and now I smell like cookies
3124 2018-05-10 18:50:54 No way omg
3125 2018-05-10 18:50:37 Brent crude prices pushed above $77/b this week, and some commentators are eyeing a return to $100/b. This is clearly good news for oil and gas producers. But in the long-term, higher crude prices boost the economics of clean energy, whose costs are falling every year.

3140 2018-05-10 18:49:07 I wonder what the reaction was when Marvin Gaye dropped "Mercy Mercy Me" in 1971, ending his verses with lines like:
"Oil wasted on the oceans and upon our seas
Fish full of mercury" 
"Radiation under ground and in the sky
Animals and birds who live nearby are dying"
3141 2018-05-10 18:49:04 Looking forward to you disclosing how much Saudi ,Qatar,Bahrain , Kuwait and all the other oil rich nations are contributing to the relief cause...that's what you should really be investigating Simon

3147 2018-05-10 18:48:35 Oil is dying & it needs to. Oil industry is heavily subsidized & probably about to be sued into oblivion in the next 10-20 years for covering up climate change. You realize they knew this in the 50s & ignored it. Greenhouse effect has been understood since the 80s too.
3148 2018-05-10 18:48:17 I decided not to pack the hair oil for fear of it leaking all over my travel case but now I'm really missing it. I bought it after I bleached/died my hair and this TN weather hasn't been kind to it
3149 2018-05-10 18:48:10 @FoxBusiness Let’s be honest! Gasoline prices are going up because the summer driving season is coming up. Oil companies please don’t give us the usual song and dance excuses! It’s just plain old greed! So much for extra money from the tax cuts 
3150 2018-05-10 18:48:07 What? Are conservative voters educated? That's a rebuttal presumption: they seem to suffer from the Midas complex. They touch healthcare: it turns into gratuitous tax deductions. They touch the environment: it turns into monetary relief for coal miners and big oil. WTF?
3151 2018-05-10 18:48:05 Oil is taking another pause for the cause after the recent Iran-inspired surge, but some of the equity plays are still catching up. Industry leader and Dow component Exxon Mobil was ahead 1.8%.

3167 2018-05-10 18:47:07 Coconut oil is nice too. Also if you leave the lid just slightly unseated (gap of <1 kernel diameter) it lets some steam escape during popping and results in a fluffier product.

3174 2018-05-10 18:46:49 Taking US out of Iran deal without a Peace plan in place, places the Middle East and World at great risk for nuclear proliferation and WAR, it empowers Saudia Arabia and Russia with greater Power over oil reserves, it hurts Americans with higher gas prices!

3175 2018-05-10 18:46:48 I mean you can. It prolly tastes like coconut oil but the color is still transferring XD

3185 2018-05-10 18:45:03 I'm curious about the origins of that food. Did an excess lump of batter fall off a piece of fish inside the oil and some cheap-ass chef decided to sell it? 

At least at @CheckersRallys, the fried lumps are free.

In 5-10 yrs it will be at or below average US crude carbon-intensity. Why penalize the ONLY jurisdiction cleaning up its heavy crude?

3191 2018-05-10 18:44:27 If we greatly reduce our dependency on oil, the value of oil falls dramatically.  While we are still stuck on gas guzzlers and polluting power plants, most other civilized nations are leaving America behind in renewables.  Long live China!
3192 2018-05-10 18:44:16 I am not saying we give up on oil but if the rest of the country wants to give up us, we don’t need to support them anymore

3196 2018-05-10 18:44:12 Kudos to President Buhari and his economy team. Unlike the previous looters government, that met in the treasure $67billion, while oil was selling above $100dollars during his time, the prodigal son never added to it, but looted it. Them Bastards.

And why not redo

3264 2018-05-10 18:37:39 Doesn’t change the fact that solar power is not only cleaner than oil consumption but it is now cheaper, and falling in price rapidly. Doesn’t matter if fracking isn’t dangerous. Solar is the future.
3265 2018-05-10 18:37:16 Here allow me.
The Iran Deal while not perfect would stop Iran for a decade. However I needed a reason to reinstate sanctions and raise oil prices to boost the failing Russian Economy.

3267 2018-05-10 18:37:05 Oil market is pretty fungible, Iran's barrels will find a way to market. This is just posturing for Trump's base by rolling back an Obama foreign policy item.
Maybe a few hundred thousand barrels a day actually wind up out of the market.
3268 2018-05-10 18:37:02 @john_gibbs48 consumers will not blame 45 and speculators for gas prices but big oil for prices at the pump. Exxon is only being reactive to demand

3273 2018-05-10 18:36:28 Wrong. Under UNCLOS III, the islands would be regarded as an “enclave” residing wholly within Scotland’s “Exclusive Economic Zone”, and as such would only have the right to resources within a 12-mile radius of their coastline – of which, in terms of oil, there are basically none.
3274 2018-05-10 18:36:27 Big hit for American businesses...Boeing had contracts worth over 30 billion to build new airliners for Iran. Oil companies were in line for similar windfalls to rebuild Iran's decaying infrastructure

3301 2018-05-10 18:33:22 Your violating the Iran deal has opened a schism with our allies, has cancelled 100+ US airplane business, permits Iran to restart its nukes, and has spiked the cost of oil to the benefit of Putin. You can’t rely on bankruptcy to get out of this mess. 
3302 2018-05-10 18:33:15 Maybe she just forgot who she was and where she lived? 
3303 2018-05-10 18:33:05 thx @brookethackray @ValueTrend This dovetails with specs net long extreme. Oil prices coming down folks. #BakesTakes_
3304 2018-05-10 18:32:55 كل دا بعمله مرة الصبح و مرة بليل: بغسل وشي، بحط تونر او ماية ورد، مرطب ( الصبح day cream و بليل bio oil) و صن بلوك الصبح. 
بحط ماسك مرتين في الاسبوع و ب exfoliate  مرتين برضه بس في ايام مختلفة ( بيقولوا ال peeling احسن بس مجربتش) 
لو عندي اي breakouts بحط عليهم مضاد حيوي.
3305 2018-05-10 18:32:47 Yeah, Al Gore @algore  is globalist puppet pushing fake climate change news. He attacks Albert's oil while turning away from the day more dirty middle Eastern and south American oil industries, not to mention the world's dirtiest oil right in Los Angeles, CA.
3306 2018-05-10 18:32:39 Ahmed Akhannouch. Le père...

"Father, the late Ahmed Ouldhadj Akhannouch, developed an oil trading business in 1930 which started as a small shop in Casablanca, Morocco."
3307 2018-05-10 18:32:27 They should make a banana boat tanning oil candle scent
3308 2018-05-10 18:32:22 I think not.  @HillaryClinton was in favor (as was President Obama!) of continuing the #Wars4Profit model... ! Also, both of them were in favor of more dirty oil & gas pipelines which undermines any credibility on support for climate action.  again.
3309 2018-05-10 18:32:13 Now they're getting higher oil prices.
3310 2018-05-10 18:32:10 Oil structure is well protected. If Iran strikes them anyway, USA will bomb cities in Iran.
3311 2018-05-10 18:32:07 334
3312 2018-05-10 18:31:57 Just need an oil change. Not interested in having you fix things...unless you can fix the rear view mirror...just an oil change. And also hold the sexual harassment. Please and thank you.
3313 2018-05-10 18:31:55 Sweet! With this one I used cilantro, lime, garlic, sesame oil and soya sauce.
3314 2018-05-10 18:31:37 What are you working on? Taking off urethane finish or starting from oil finish? Re-checkering?
3315 2018-05-10 18:31:25 Finna do this hot oil treatment with this wild growth oil and lay it on down, it’s so damn hot outside.
3316 2018-05-10 18:31:22 She gone try to do extras and I need to get my nails done after my oil change lol I ain’t got time to be going back and fourth with her
3317 2018-05-10 18:31:20 We're sentient patches of oil swept along down corridors of shadow. #cyberpunk
3318 2018-05-10 18:31:08 Alex Jones is a snake oil salesman.
3319 2018-05-10 18:31:08 Your an idiot! The clean tar sands oil transported through a pipeline that does not emit any pollution would take thousands of trucks off the highway that are currently transporting it and free up rail traffic to transport the grain back log. Facts matter, all you got is lies.
3320 2018-05-10 18:30:50 Easy. Trump foolishly leaving the #IranDeal and reimposing sanctions has driven up the price of oil and with it gas prices.
3321 2018-05-10 18:30:46 Whip together 11 lbs carrots with 2 cups dips. Mix in Olive Oil. Freeze for 9 hours. Serve with love.
3322 2018-05-10 18:30:43 Hello, I'm planning to do some oil painting and I'm wondering if those who paint in oil have tips. What is the best thinner and why do you prefer it? Please provide FAQs for heaviness, texture, gossiness or matt, etc.Thsnk you, Nan Umphrey
3323 2018-05-10 18:30:40 I'm remembering ugly comments tRump made during his campaign..He said he loves war..He would have bombed the sh*t out of Iraq & taken their oil. IMO, he's a war mongering Putin Puppet who's going to get us all killed if we aren't careful. I hate him.

3328 2018-05-10 18:30:19 That is why I only drink Tyent double filtered ionized water! Big difference. Not only clean water but ionized, split in 2 streams. Acid water and Alkaline water. Nothing like it anywhere! Ever see oil mix with water? Yep!

3330 2018-05-10 18:30:12 1/  Nope.  And you can find the reason in Trump's treatment of environmental issues.  Obama (and would be Clinton) instituted policies that would REDUCE our demand on oil and other fossil fuels.  This would eventually cause crude oil to be virtually worthless.
3331 2018-05-10 18:30:08 Word has it Alberta Oil Sands are actually cleaner than what comes from California. Or Alaska. Or Nigeria. Or a lot of other places.
And on a side note, most of the First Nations along the pipeline route are not standing anywhere near you.
3332 2018-05-10 18:29:58 @john_gibbs48 when oil prices shot up to a consumer set break point they stopped buying gas guzzling cars and stayed cut back eating out. Online shopping will do well but cement retail not
3333 2018-05-10 18:29:54 The immediate solution to hyperinflation is to reorder the fiscal deficit (PDVSA deficit and stop selling oil for free inland) and create a new currency under control of central bank rules and the constitution.
Of course with a new government...
3334 2018-05-10 18:29:52 Rename extra virgin olive oil to incel olive oil
3335 2018-05-10 18:29:37 @moliverworld Those who say that since we need oil and therefore need pipelines often overlook the fact that pipelines are built to last over 20 years and we need to get off oil sooner than that.
3336 2018-05-10 18:29:37 We got that lift-off! Let's see how far it goes. Let's hope it goes far and we catch most of it, then do what we have to do after closing that long (encouraging notebook post) :)

3340 2018-05-10 18:29:19 It's best if I cook some mustard oil mashed potatoes or fish to sum it all up
3341 2018-05-10 18:29:04 thx @topdowncharts @wallstscott Oil will sink soon. #BakesTakes_
3342 2018-05-10 18:29:03 The oil and gas companies should remain there. They will come, greed will perpetuate substandard works #SolaiDamTragedy issues will recur.
3343 2018-05-10 18:28:49 Iran stole UK oil to give to Germany, France convinced Carter to bring back ayatollah , Libya was an opportunity for Europeans to get their lost riches from gaddafi , now France was suppose to provide airport for men in nigers .they should up unarmed .
3344 2018-05-10 18:28:43 even if it was free, who measures oil
3345 2018-05-10 18:28:28 On the sea of Hormuz? Shut down oil shipments and incur huge economic instability?
3346 2018-05-10 18:28:24 In haste I read this.

Yes, it will revivify SMEs in the sector, and it's overall a godsend.

My choice of words could have been better.

Oil & gas sector entities with deteriorating short-term liquidity (ie, working capital, ABLs, etc) is a present reality for too many.

3352 2018-05-10 18:28:03 Putin will sit back and enjoy the oil price
3353 2018-05-10 18:27:47  it’s bomb... a little on the under salted side but that’s what makes it better! The smash fries are tossed with olive oil and herbs
3354 2018-05-10 18:27:43 Matt Frei trying to blame Iran for starting the strikes on #C4News! Has he got total amnesia about the previous repeated Israeli strikes on Syria, blasted across the news, or is he following a biased agenda, ignoring Israel breaking int law in occupying Golan & taking Syrian oil?
3355 2018-05-10 18:27:31 Radz has made himself a fair pile I reckon but putting it into a Football club you’ve bought as an investment takes nerve or pockets as deep as an oil well.
3356 2018-05-10 18:27:30 Oil is the blood of the earth....
3357 2018-05-10 18:27:21 All the sugars in one plate . even the Virgin olive oil... 
3358 2018-05-10 18:26:56 No. Like most other small, northern European countries, we'd probably be pretty wealthy. Countries with oil reserves and high levels of education tend to be very wealthy, especially in nice peaceful parts of the world like northwestern Europe.
3359 2018-05-10 18:26:53 If they chant "death to America" there is a reason.  I know most Americans like to live in the bliss of ignorance but our government, military and corporations have been murdering, stealing, sabotaging and interfering in their affairs ever since oil was first found there.
3360 2018-05-10 18:26:48 Yes sure remember that wall that Mexici was going to pay for?   BTW, enjoy your extra high gas prices!  We got a lot of oil from Iran!!!!!!
3361 2018-05-10 18:26:41 My car is a mess. New thermostat, oil change, new water pump, now looks like new radiator.
3362 2018-05-10 18:26:40 Just compared to oil based it doesn’t come close. I thought as it was Dulux weathershield would be ok but not in my opinion I’m afraid
3363 2018-05-10 18:26:19 i haven’t tried putting peppermint oil in my hair, i know it’s a really concentrated oil in general and makes my skin irritated when i come in contact with it? i also haven’t heard about any special benefits so it might just be a nice smelling placebo
3364 2018-05-10 18:26:18 Will also help Nigeria, as they need oil to be above $60 to finance their budget; more importantly what about Europe?
3365 2018-05-10 18:26:18 Has been ploughed into this great nation.

Channel tunnel
M25+++
Cross rail 
Sewer upgrades in London 
The total demolishment of industry in favour of finance
The decimation of the coal mines
The privatisation of the countries assets
Without oil would this have all been possible.
3366 2018-05-10 18:26:16 Coconut oil odourless 
Has changed my life

Why didnt you tell me guys
3367 2018-05-10 18:25:49 Translated: Iran may reduce their income from oil sales by $70mil/d. Increased oil price won’t compensate enough.
3368 2018-05-10 18:25:47 same. gotta do more research. straight up weed doesn’t fix mine, but i don’t know how that correlates. suspect cbd oil is more concentrated. it’s basically thc-free so i do wonder how it works.
3369 2018-05-10 18:25:24 I'm sorry about that. I'm going to look into ordering that oil. Last question, and thank you for your help!! Is there specific ingredients I should look for or avoid?

3374 2018-05-10 18:24:58 Yeah they don't take in consideration how many peoples e.i ran out or went on welfare . Or the fact many had to take much lower paying jobs , or the fact that construction workers and oil workers are getting back to work .
3375 2018-05-10 18:24:57 Eu and Iran love their stupid democrats. Iran stole UK oil to give to Germany in ww2 , France convinced Carter to bring back ayatollah. Eu convinced Hillary and jihadist Obama to overthrow Libya . Did you read UK Libya report ,it was for profit so eu can get their lost spoils

3380 2018-05-10 18:24:39 LOL.  Alberta and Saskatchewan is the heart of free enterprise.  Oil and farm country.
3381 2018-05-10 18:24:24 My mood this summer is when guys ask me out to eat, ima tell them to take me grocery shopping instead. Healthy foods expensive. Nat and I bought a cake for $6.99, and avocado oil which is “healthy” is the same price
3382 2018-05-10 18:24:08 Water and oil. Water and oil.

3384 2018-05-10 18:23:46 Why no mention of his representing Zarrab & meeting w Erdogan last year? Why not mention Zarrab was also charged w conspiracies to commit money laundering & bank fraud? Why no expose on Rudy being intl oil lawyer & security consultant to terror funders & consultant to oligarchs?

3390 2018-05-10 18:23:21 Buckle up, Norway! If Donald does not get the Nobel Prize he will give Norway to Russia and take the oil.
3391 2018-05-10 18:23:10 Pretty good, but WE get views of oil trains and parking garage fires!
3392 2018-05-10 18:23:09 Disagree. Money is good in football and betting.Idiots say we boycott world cup. Let them boycott and see if this is the 80s or 90s. Crimes against humanity  in DRC minerals, oil etc not good for the world.

3398 2018-05-10 18:22:49 I can't even blame them. No oil spills from the existing KM pipeline, they invested a lot of time and money on due diligence, meeting all requirements no matter how excessive, and after all of that, this is how we treat them. It's actually quite embarrassing.

3412 2018-05-10 18:20:59 He’s mad at car makers because they want to continue improving fuel economy? Are his oil baron friends not making enough money? For the few that actually got a tax cut, raise or bonus this administration keeps finding ways to take that money back. 
3413 2018-05-10 18:20:58 @AlGore should be looking at California’s Bakken Fields which have much higher carbon emissions than AB’s environmentally progressive oil sands. Gore has made billions on the climate change scam. He is all about self-interest, like all faux eco-zealots, include that fraud Suzuki.
3414 2018-05-10 18:20:54 it's because she made false comments about the oil sands dummy.

3420 2018-05-10 18:20:28 We are great at transferring electric energy with humongous energy density but we suck at storing "electricity". Energy density for batteries is pathetic. Thus battery cars had to be inefficient and "dirty".    
BTW most probably we will run out Lithium for batteries before oil.
3421 2018-05-10 18:20:23 These guys have some great stuff.. the vanilla and mango oil is a particular favourite! 
3422 2018-05-10 18:20:20 UCP didn't exist 9 months ago, much less when oil was $100/bbl. WRP OPPOSED the reckless spending during the later PC years and will continue to do so as part of the UCP
3423 2018-05-10 18:20:17 I saw a lady coated the pole with oil (vegetable, I believe) and the rat (squirrel) just kept sliding down.
3424 2018-05-10 18:20:06 @realDonaldTrump is it true that ending the Iran deal was all about oil and Russia? As an American citizens I demand a honest answer from you.
3425 2018-05-10 18:20:05 They won’t. Centrists always vote for more wars and big oil and Israel and the military industrial corporate congressional complex. Who are you kidding Ro? This is why true blue leftists fight everyday against these Centrists and sell out DINO  shills.
3426 2018-05-10 18:20:04 Netanyahu’s spokesman given airtime on #C4News to decry Iran and blame Iran for Israel’s own provocations by continually firing on Syria. Israel is occupying Syrian Golan Heights, taking Syrian oil via Israel Genie Oil. No mention of that fact.

3. Coil loosely and place in disposable aluminum turkey baking pan
4. Bake at 220 F for about 20 min

3430 2018-05-10 18:19:44 Pointing out your contradiction is easy enough...if American wants to be great, it needs cheap gas and food.  If it wants cheap gas and food, it needs to play the global chess game.  After all 60% of all our oil comes from abroad.
3431 2018-05-10 18:19:34 .#Cheney: Does #WaterBoarding work? Let's WB you and see if you admit invading Iraq for oil while outting CIA agent, Plame, who opposed you.
3432 2018-05-10 18:19:29 @jimmygotyme @Shell_Canada @cathmckenna great now maybe the Canadian government can take over the oil industry in Canada
3433 2018-05-10 18:19:24 Also everything you are using is made from oil. Seriously how do you not feel so stupid for the hypocrisy you exude.
3434 2018-05-10 18:19:22 Cost of oil is fixed, worker's productivity isn't and I think availability of substitution matters.
3435 2018-05-10 18:19:12 Good! You only gotta use it every so often. Make sure to also put the coconut oil for your hair in a separate container than the one you purchase. That way you don't contaminate it.
3436 2018-05-10 18:19:02 Disgusting sadists. Don't need torture. U need info..give the enemy 10ml of 20 percent THC oil and in one hour he will be so hungry and tanked..they'll tell anything and truthfully. Sadist.

3440 2018-05-10 18:18:46 How is an American holding an opinion about the Alberta oil sands "interfering with our country"? Free speech, yada yada yada...
3441 2018-05-10 18:18:38 British oil firms creamed off 90% profit from Iranian oil before being booted out by the democratically elected Mohammad Mosaddegh, what followed in 1953 was a US & British coup & from the ashes BP was born. Scottish oil is their right & won't want to let go so easily
3442 2018-05-10 18:18:32 *throws water on the oil fire*
3443 2018-05-10 18:18:19 You put premium in that? Lmfao girl heck no. Mid grade and keep that oil change you are good.

3445 2018-05-10 18:18:11 I lived a long time in Indonesia. Every year Singapore was in a cloud of smoke from the burn off in Sumatra as landowners cleared rainforest. Palm Oil is a crop with harmful repercussions.
3446 2018-05-10 18:17:56 I burn it off with tea tree oil , black soap, anything that stings

3449 2018-05-10 18:17:39 Do they contain palm oil? I used to love a milkybar but I understand Nestle's suppliers are not sourcing palm oil responsibly and are contributing to habitat and species destruction?

3452 2018-05-10 18:17:25 My son went there to get a 20$ oil change they ended up telling him everything needed replaced. Ended up paying 250$ you know for the bullshit air filter,radiator cap and who knows what else. Fuck them. I pay a little extra and dont have to hear their bullshit

3461 2018-05-10 18:16:22 I hear the vaping of THC oil during class is very popular nowadays. And if caught, strict AISD gives ya 2 days of ISS. Unbelievable. Heaven forbid these morons wait until school is out.

3469 2018-05-10 18:15:13 two albums that are 25 years old that fill me with incredulity -

Earth and Sun and Moon by Midnight Oil (that's one of the NEWER Midnight Oil albums!)
3470 2018-05-10 18:15:11 Wow it's literally snake oil
3471 2018-05-10 18:15:09 Coconut oil is a good way to massage your scalp! I use it at times when i don't wash my hair. If I do it's about once or twice a week.
3472 2018-05-10 18:15:03 Your first truck race at Eldora!
3473 2018-05-10 18:14:45 Really don’t wanna pay for an oil change
3474 2018-05-10 18:14:44 i personally eat honey if it's in stuff like meridian butters, because they're free of palm oil, and palm oil is worse for the environment than honey is in the long run
3475 2018-05-10 18:14:42 Any Caster Oil Or You Have To Use A Specific One ?
3476 2018-05-10 18:14:33 When dollars index drop equally in oil supply country's then it changes
3477 2018-05-10 18:14:30 Global oil prices have hit a three-year highs so far in 2018. First quarter was hit with a high of $78 a barrel.
3478 2018-05-10 18:14:27 Alternative idea use for the mountain site could be a strategic food reserves like we do for oil.
3479 2018-05-10 18:14:25 Great read JMV!!! Starts here: "Looks like we found it. Trump is withdrawing US from the Iran nuclear deal. Oil prices should go up, which is good for us." How's the price of oil looking at your local gas station? Wait until you see inflation a year from now...thanks @POTUS @GOP
3480 2018-05-10 18:14:08 Yeah, but our sparkly HTPLA is not modified with lubricants. Lubricants make the material less translucent, and cut down the depth & sparkly. I recommend a touch of oil to make up for the lack of teflon in the hotend & keep thinks moving...@toniwryan @_Tinkerz thoughts?
3481 2018-05-10 18:14:06 Despite the oil stock love I think they're on very short leashes by young, lemming generalist analysts who truly only love tech
3482 2018-05-10 18:14:02 Only that really clean Saudi oil for your ostentatious jumbo jet. Man, you've got bullshit down to an art form you fucking hypocrite.
3483 2018-05-10 18:13:58 I assume oil tankers still 100% safe and no ban on east coast for our wonderful 650000 barrels if import oil
3484 2018-05-10 18:13:52 I need to get me some more wild growth oil

3486 2018-05-10 18:13:23 Every player should be on 5k a week and fans in for £5. On the way out you throw in each players empty oil drum what you think his performance deserves. Soon see improvements 
3487 2018-05-10 18:13:23 you have no power.  you are irrelevant.  you and the rest of the "famous " people preaching about the oil sands in Alberta know less than nothing.  your opinion is hillarious since before this post I didn't even know you were still alive.  that is how obsolete and irrelivent U R

Oh and sky rocketing debt and deficit.  

Oh and climbing oil prices destroying any tax relief.
3493 2018-05-10 18:12:47 Trump talks about pulling out of Iran deal oil prices go up. Trump pulls out of the Iran deal, oil prices stay high and could go higher. Which country wins? Russia!! Coincidence?...I don't think so

3498 2018-05-10 18:12:10 Esso:  When Standard Oil was broken up, the part covering the east was called Eastern States Standard Oil. They owned the canadian subsidiary. The US part had to stop using the name (calling itself EXXON) but left Canada with ESSO.
3499 2018-05-10 18:11:59 at this rate we’ll be losing $2 bil per year in smuggled oil by 2022, those realistic estimates should be published instead..
3500 2018-05-10 18:11:56 Nigeria received roughly $18bn of Investment in the last quarter. Of all those, oil and gas received the bulk of it at $13bn. This means oil and gas is still the most viable game in our Naij town.
3501 2018-05-10 18:11:31 @john_gibbs48 45 created uncertainty of oil prices before and after his back track with Iran. High Oil prices can b tied to low consumer spending triggers job loss
3502 2018-05-10 18:11:19 What is wrong with Oil

It is dirty because of nuclear decay

What is Green Oil

Oils down to the cells it came from

3511 2018-05-10 18:09:41 The American people WILL NOT SUPPORT another Sunni Shia proxy war over oil and gas dependence of the EU in order to undermine the Russian economy. We're tired of this crap. The current resulting World War 2 sized refugee crisis is DESTROYING nations. JUST STOP IT ALREADY.
3512 2018-05-10 18:09:37 “Fair enough... Guess dancers do need to protect their bodies as if they were high quality treasure.” Once more standing, he dusted the dirt from his knees and straightened out his shirt. “As for oil... Well, that would also probably be bad. You could twist your ankle.” Without-
3513 2018-05-10 18:09:32 That's what it's all about. There is this massive mindless MAGA crowd out there, with their wallets out. Just tell them what they want to hear and they'll buy your trinkets, books, and snake oil
3514 2018-05-10 18:09:30 Minimizing carbon risk exposure might mean you extract the oil but don’t build up avoidably big state liabilities at the same time (eg large NOCs) or you think carefully about building an oil dependent wider economy eg via local content, skills and downstream value addition

we bombed syria & pulled out of the iran

3529 2018-05-10 18:08:11 @UmaruSanda I'm all for the demonstration against the exploration of crude oil in the Volta region provided it's not anchored on any political legs. B'cos as Ghanaians, the exploration our mineral resources has done us more harm than good ! #CitiNewsRoom
3530 2018-05-10 18:08:03 @CBCNews of Iran in 1953 and the current government is a result of the oil corporations greed and their control over ........
3531 2018-05-10 18:08:00 It's just beeswax, pine roisin and jojoba oil. Nothing very tricky x
3532 2018-05-10 18:07:55 Really should oil the strop of my Rolls.
3533 2018-05-10 18:07:41 Luv luv luv Midnight Oil... great political band
3534 2018-05-10 18:07:41 yeah!! :3 I just wish I wa swallowed to put more oil and salt in it >.<
3535 2018-05-10 18:07:38 I haven't used their stuff but it looks solid. I oil every day and do conditioners when I do a thorough wash, which is usually every 2/3 days. Overwashing imo definitely increases itch kind of counterintuitively. I also recommend boar brushes&brushing it up/out with a wide brush.
3536 2018-05-10 18:07:38 Iran has oil, but also 80 million odd people. They can do just fine selling their oil in Yuan or Euros. No need for USD in 2018.
3537 2018-05-10 18:07:26 Coal is tricky since the rents are so much less than for oil or gas. But big state liabilities do create a challenge. For low income oil rich countries I think few citizens would choose the ‘leave it in the ground’ route right now. But at least they should minimize risk exposure
3538 2018-05-10 18:07:25 @elonmusk Business Idea: Lets create an unmanned mining drone to mine oil on titan. the 20% we have discovered has over 100 times more oil than all of earth easy money
3539 2018-05-10 18:07:19 I personally use sweet almond oil or coconut oil for my hair :) I 'm not using any spray tho just the pure product that I apply by hand.
3540 2018-05-10 18:07:09 Not just conservatives talk about these.

3541 2018-05-10 18:07:09 I mentioned the 2 mil bpd by 2022 estimate to this woman working in the oil sector when she asked me about how the oil situation is in libya rn and she rolled her eyes at me lol
3542 2018-05-10 18:07:05 Ikoyi, VI, Yaba (1 of our 1st planned cities) etc existed pre independence. Present infrastructure from Eko, to 3rd mainland bridge to the expressways, Fed secretariat, Concretisation of TBS, National theatre, Tin can port were all constructed in building frenzy of oil rich 70s

3545 2018-05-10 18:06:27 You get a oil change like every week
3546 2018-05-10 18:06:18 I smell a Big Oil straw man argument coming.

3547 2018-05-10 18:06:11 I want a draft-develop strategy. But is Dougie Hamilton the answer to help Oil. Flames need draft picks and have too many D. Can we send 2-1st rdr? Its expensive. But we also have 6 more rounds to draft guys. Dougie also affordable. Play with Nurse.
3548 2018-05-10 18:06:01 When you see fast money in love with the energy trade, and newbies trading Oil, you know what usually comes next.
3549 2018-05-10 18:05:48 Its possible man.  I went from working 16 hrs days in the oil field to a cushy IT job.
3550 2018-05-10 18:05:38 Iranian citizens will never forget the disgusting vote of Canadian senators in favors of the criminal leaders of Iran and the oil money.

3551 2018-05-10 18:05:34 Easy to say when it is not your country. I would like a plan to invest in clean energy and believe we can be a world leader. However you can't just say screw oil. Perhaps you have an electric car or get driven everywhere

3563 2018-05-10 18:03:43 It's the someone letting to much air into the pump and causing the boiling oil to break down...
3564 2018-05-10 18:03:43 Just keep collecting it and wilting it a little butter and/or olive oil. This may not be a practical way eradicating it but worth a try I’d say.
3565 2018-05-10 18:03:36 "Enhanced interrogation" is the security equivalent of "clean coal" and "ethical oil." The best way to win a war against people is to first win the war against words.
3566 2018-05-10 18:03:33 Why don’t you guys get the oil changed or something?
3567 2018-05-10 18:03:26 How about you look in the mirror. How many flights taken? Cars owned? Homes owned? Of course it’s easier to attack Canada’s economy and it’s very strong environmental standards.  Doesn’t affect you does it?  Inconvenient Truth.  Lets hear you speak about California Heavy Oil.
3568 2018-05-10 18:03:26 Try adding healthy fats into it, like MCT oil or butter if you eat dairy.. it slows down the absorption of caffeine and removes the anxious feeling you may get
3569 2018-05-10 18:03:23 Been using beard conditioner and beard oil daily for 6-7 days lol
3570 2018-05-10 18:03:10 Definately the slider fest between you and @CBellRacing at the #4crown a few years ago.
3571 2018-05-10 18:03:07 And whyyyyyyy does the oil change place have a show on tv about children saying goodbye to their dog because he's about to die?!!!!! I really don't want to cry inside an automotive place. 
3572 2018-05-10 18:03:04 $XOP better play than $XLE given price level in Oil? $XOP higher beta & correl w/ Oil as well as break-evens being $35/barrel for E&P's
3573 2018-05-10 18:02:57 I’m 2 days into using wild growth oil and I’m already seeing results

3577 2018-05-10 18:02:21 Iranian cyber army is responsible for several attacks contacted over the internet which crippled the operations of oil firms, banks, financial institutions and many other related establishments all over the word so Iranian cyber attack may take place at any time
3578 2018-05-10 18:02:20 Two years ago, most of us thought it was impossible to have oil prices over U$100 again, and we're almost there once more. It seems the power from shale is yet not enough to keep prices down.

3581 2018-05-10 18:01:58 Anyone remember how the Iran Deal and Iran exports coming on stream was going to permanently sink oil prices?

3585 2018-05-10 18:01:39 All the Iran deal was doing is giving Monies to Iran by exporting their oil & where r the $s going?  Not helping their ppl.  Funding terrorism?  This deal was all for businesses to profit.

3587 2018-05-10 18:01:36 Good evening all my Tuesday evening groups painting. I thought they were all different and all made a great job. We started with the boat which we did using acrilic paint. Then finished it offthe following week with seascape using oil paint. Very proud of them all.
3588 2018-05-10 18:01:31 The most memorable moment I have is when BC met you at your car after winning the Chili Bowl
3589 2018-05-10 18:01:25 Switzerland’s direct democracy and fractious EU link were indeed extolled in Hannan’s populist ‘The Plan’ 2008 et seq but it is all snake oil to a Falangist or Leninist: take your pick. He is not a “liberal Leaver” by any standard
3590 2018-05-10 18:01:20 Unpopular opinion: invest in crude oil.
3591 2018-05-10 18:01:13 I bring baby oil and no baby has been harmed doing it
3592 2018-05-10 18:01:13 Glad I swerved it a couple of weeks ago now. Purposely drive to a different place to get the oil based. Is it really bad ?
3593 2018-05-10 18:01:09 There will be no new sanctions because Trump has no plan. Our allies, Russia and China will trade with Iran. Iran will make billions selling oil again. No one has any incentive to negotiate with Trump because he has no credibility.
3594 2018-05-10 18:01:08 Yes, but all it did was make me want to eat the coconut oil. Such a waste to spit it out
3595 2018-05-10 18:01:04 Trump Snake Oil Training Manual: Chapter 1- Always accuse your opponents of that of which you are guilty.
3596 2018-05-10 18:01:02 Let see: Iraq, Halliburton, torture, Nixon, no pulse, backroom oil regs...that's the first six that popped up off the top of my head, so, hey, you're right!
3597 2018-05-10 18:00:47 5)Go back and insist they retest You! Which brings me back to the cannibas oil. Did it stop progression, or just help with the Pain? What difference did you notice?

Sorry to take so much of your time!

3604 2018-05-10 18:00:30 Getting the oil change in my husband's truck. Why is driving over the pit the scariest thing ever? It's like I forget how to drive in a straight line. Ugh #oilchange #dontfallinthepit
3605 2018-05-10 18:00:20 Exactly!   The Trump administration is trying to reassemble the unholy alliance between the auto & oil industry that fell apart more than a decade ago.
3606 2018-05-10 18:00:15 i used to have bad skin and what i did was switch to showering at night before bed instead of in the morning, and place a fresh towel over my pillow each night to absorb nighttime oil buildup

i still evening shower but i don't bother with the towel anymore
3607 2018-05-10 18:00:14 Fuck you for whiting out my drive, I love'm dearly, but I may have been running the same engine oil for almost 20k miles?

3616 2018-05-10 17:59:00 Our team tried to engage in meaningful conversation with those in opposition by
listening intently. We agreed that the protection of our environment comes 1st [hence Canada's stringent environmental policies & regulations]

We shared facts-to which they responded: "EAT YOUR OIL!"

To be isolated for thirty years away from sane people !
3619 2018-05-10 17:58:43 Do you think them hating us has ANYTHING to do with us overthrowing their government in the 50's so that new gov't would privatize their oil fields for BP? Might piss us off a little too if someone OVERTHREW OUR GOVERNMENT???? Yeah, might get a page or two in our history books.

3625 2018-05-10 17:58:05 did you use the oil with it?
3626 2018-05-10 17:58:01 That will never happen. Saudi Arabia is US biggest alie in the middle East. Their oil power is too big for the United States to atack, that will just ruin the US plans to control that area
3627 2018-05-10 17:57:55 The new oil is our data that companies like Facebook use to make money they then don’t pay tax on - @carolineslocock at #socialwealthfund event. We propose this source of money for a CWF in our paper, but look out for detail from @DantonsHead and @Laurie_L_L upcoming CEJ paper
3628 2018-05-10 17:57:55 Are you happy with the increase in U.S. oil prices? Russia is grateful for your move- their oil exports are becoming much more lucrative. Once again you put them first.

Oh...and some oil...but we are all starting to wonder if they have as much as they want us to believe...
3632 2018-05-10 17:57:34 Oil Marketing Cos in focus

- China's April oil imports touch record highs in April 2018

- April shipments 39.46MT (up 7% YoY) or 9.6MBPD vs 9.57MBPD in Jan 18

- Jan-Apr 18 Imports up 9% YoY to 151.43MT led by Govt/Pvt plants raising production
3633 2018-05-10 17:57:29 Also from Ian Bremmer  @AsiaSocietyNY - Saudi Arabia will have difficulty changing it's oil dependent economy.  KSA needs to invest heavily in education and hire foreign talent.  Ian argues that it is too late despite having money to invest in education. #intled #KSA

3645 2018-05-10 17:56:48 You just keep selling that snake oil about this being Obama’s achievement. The same guy who blamed Bush for 8 yrs when anything went wrong? Now he’s going to take credit for Trump’s accomplishments for the next 8 years? He’d better or there will be ZERO legacy left for him

3647 2018-05-10 17:56:33 Barbara windsor needs to take coconut oil daily to help her alzheimers symptoms get better...if anyone knows her family please tell them
3648 2018-05-10 17:56:19 By sanctioning Iran, it effectively limits oil's ability to get to market, therefore countries that may be buyers of Iran oil will have to look elsewhere. It effectively removes supply from the market, driving prices higher. It remains to be seen if other countries will follow.
3649 2018-05-10 17:56:10  Folks!  Here we have a physical result of withdrawing from the JCPOA.  Oil prices went up after Donald's announcement.  Russia loves high oil prices, being a producer.  If you don't like paying a lot for gas, complain to Donald - not the gas companies.
3650 2018-05-10 17:56:08 Again unrealistic. I think a far bigger fish to fry is big oil holding the planet hostage. Our climate change ignorance will cause far more damage and lives lost long term than any short term volcano eruption or tornado or earthquake.
3651 2018-05-10 17:56:06 I just want to say how disappointed I am of @jiffylube took my Jeep in to get an oil change before a  roadtrip and they broke off the dipstick in my transmission.spend 5 hours off the road fixing my car due to their mistake. Do not go to @jiffylube as they are very careless.
3652 2018-05-10 17:56:06 No one can afford gas to get to work the oil prices jumping by leaps and bounds so much for the pay increases it’s getting gobbled up in your oil hikes!!!

3656 2018-05-10 17:55:30 I think it's worse than that.  I think he's doing it to increase unrest in the Middle East, in order to drive up oil prices for his buddy Vlad.  You know Russia is essentially an oil compay with a standing army and nuclear capabilities.  The recent dip in oil prices has hurt them
3657 2018-05-10 17:55:15 Is the NDP adding historic debt ? True or false ? . Do you realize that it is the surge in oil prices that is fueling albertas economy right now ?
3658 2018-05-10 17:55:14 It was all about the oil and every Iranian who lived through it remembers it well!  The U.S. removed their leader to reinstate the U.S. backed dictator!
3659 2018-05-10 17:55:02 So excited to see #GuyanaCarnival boost Tourism. Everyone gonna eat. We better make sure the coconuts and plantain chips don’t stop flowing. Curious to see if the skunts will come back to support or will they just come when it’s time to invest in that oil schmoney.

3662 2018-05-10 17:54:35 Same thing happened to me suh, literally went in for an oil change and ended up leaving with two new tires and getting my car aligned smh
3663 2018-05-10 17:54:34 How would him changing the policy make my life better it won't, I believe we should use and sell last of our oil reserves before we have tech that makes them obsolete.  Money is more important
3664 2018-05-10 17:54:25 I can honestly say that I don’t think this letter goes out if Tillerson was still there.  At least he knows where we buy all the oil from
3665 2018-05-10 17:54:17 In the days when ikoyi and VI were built, there was no oil.

Lekki expressway was built with oil proceeds, yes. But the massive development of property has come from proceeds of diverse private trade. Not just oil, imports of all kinds have made Lagos rich.
3666 2018-05-10 17:54:13 Actually perishable food can be sold to animal farms.  With planning perishable food can be donated to missions and food banks.  I have seen ice cream, meat, cheese, dairy, and produce at food banks.  However, management and local laws prevail.  Waste food and oil used also!
3667 2018-05-10 17:54:13 Having tea tree oil and coconut oil in my life is honestly tremendous
3668 2018-05-10 17:54:00 IF the Russians, Chinese, Iranians want to rebuild the Syria & Middle-East into prosperity thru foreign investment in oil&gas infra, from which all parties involved profit, they need to provide military protection against the predatory Zionist-Wallstreet empire.

3673 2018-05-10 17:53:36 I guess this bodes well for me. On my schedule this weekend is to change the oil and replace the battery in mine. As those are just routine maintenance items, I'm now bolstered by your success.
3674 2018-05-10 17:53:31 It's time for all Americans to stand up for American farmers and lift regulations on ethanol and stop big oil influence interfering with American farmers welfare.

3681 2018-05-10 17:52:30 Obviously you're mind set is still in 4th grade. We're no longer in occupational era. What your gov't did is basically occupy and put up a toll in SCS to all passing vessels and dig up all oil. No thanks to BO and HC. They could have done something to stop it but choose not to.

3694 2018-05-10 17:51:35 It’s oil sands oil Al and maybe you should focus on cleaning up all the crap in your own country before sticking your nose into Canada’s business with your misleading rhetoric
3695 2018-05-10 17:51:25 Nothing like pouring oil on troubled waters, totally negative!
3696 2018-05-10 17:51:20 Oil cleanser breaks down makeup and attracts excess oil on your face (yay science!) without stripping the skin! When you rinse off the cleanser you rise off all that gunk too. Then use a face wash and it will penetrate the skin instead of sitting on top of makeup and oil!
3697 2018-05-10 17:51:05 I’m sure the shitty palm oil they can’t use for cosmetics gets thrown in the jet fuel as well. So they are burning the shittiest stuff up in the sky which to me is way scarier than any weather modification.
3698 2018-05-10 17:51:05 Honestly mechanics and oil change guys are the nicest people and just help you out of the goodness of their heart a lot of times w no change is a blessing 
3699 2018-05-10 17:50:52 There is a move afoot to force taverna owners to replace glass olive oil n little bottles with plastic sachets. Not here yet, thank goodness. Such a mistake as the charm is with the locally sourced and filled flasks
3700 2018-05-10 17:50:51 Vegans only 

If “milk” was an alternative source of fuel and could be harvested safely without the process of forced impregnating and it removed the need for oil because it was more efficient . Would you be For or against it
3701 2018-05-10 17:50:47 I’d have to say, the truck race in Texas when you almost won!

3710 2018-05-10 17:49:28 I used to do work for a private security n forensic investigation firm. Honestly, im surprised this took so long. Grateful though we live in an oil free country or one on a strategic trade route.

3721 2018-05-10 17:48:40 Es que esto no se trata de peak oil, ni de desplazar una por otra, se trata de empezar a crear una nueva cadena de valor y crear desarrollo comunitario. Saludos!
3722 2018-05-10 17:48:40 I am for the expansion. I do not tie high gas prices to TMX. I recognize we have had dilbit transported by pipeline for years with no spills in coastal waters. I see that each and every oil tanker is (and will be) escorted past Victoria to the open ocean.

3728 2018-05-10 17:47:54 These people are burning Iranian Oil via Russian pipelines, hammering US for Global Warming and any other Capitalistic issue they can think of while stoking us for protection. Finally Obama suggested  Merkel to be over run by Islamists and its our fault.

3730 2018-05-10 17:47:42 #Israel occupies Syrian land. Israel is stealing Syrian oil out of the land it occupies. Israel has been giving AlQaeda medical aid out of the land it stole. Israel has launched 100 unprovoked attacks against #Syria. When #Syria retaliates, #Israel acts like the victim.
3731 2018-05-10 17:47:36 Just got back from the barber, feels so much better 
Also beard oil makes a huge difference and smells actually really nice
3732 2018-05-10 17:47:33 Not so surprising re the producers given western select price. Means stock picking is important. Suncor has by far the best cost structure and operating strategy and it shows. High cost producers have started to move only recently being more levered to oil price.
3733 2018-05-10 17:47:33 I’ve been using Clubman Pinaud beard oil and beard conditioner for about a week. Wasn’t sure how often to use each one though bc I don’t want to overdo it? But I’ve been using each one daily. It was really bad for about 4 days though.
3734 2018-05-10 17:47:25 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
3735 2018-05-10 17:47:23 That's the oddest request for cheap oil I've ever read.
3736 2018-05-10 17:47:23 I wish they had to live on food stamps and I know about N.Tesla, Free Energy and hope that the Oil companies will live their next life as snakes or lower form their desicible work when the truth is known.
3737 2018-05-10 17:47:22 One way I see this playing out is soon open war w/ Israel & Iran, infra strikes reducing Iran's oil production capability. Oil shock + tariffs -> china financial crisis. 2. Interesting re Kushner, if he goes to jail I would expect impeachment soon after...
3738 2018-05-10 17:47:11 I’ve been using Clubman Pinaud beard oil and beard conditioner for about a week. Wasn’t sure how often to use each one though bc I don’t want to overdo it? But I’ve been using each one daily.

Ambos em zona ursa, sendo a PETR4 indexada em dólares, mas esperaria algum pivô de baixa no intraday 60/120 para algum tipo de realização/venda, pois o OIL, e mesmo o IBovespa, podem subir mais um pouco.

Olho vivo!!

3742 2018-05-10 17:46:42 Taib completely pocketed it everything. Sabah the same with the Kitigan brothers and UMNO. Oil royalties is 20% for each state (I think).
3743 2018-05-10 17:45:50 The world - certainly the U.S. - has already forgotten about the Exxon Valdez and the huge BP Oil spill in the Gulf. We can and must do better. #ActOnClimate #KeepItInTheGround

3752 2018-05-10 17:45:08 I confirmed it extensively. Malaysia has basically been colonized by foreign corporations for palm oil farming for biofuel.

3755 2018-05-10 17:44:51 Israel does not want no ones oil or food we have bought land all over the world for that.
3756 2018-05-10 17:44:50 Climate change is just a money grabbing scam by the gov to fund their globetrotting, partying, living high off the hog ways. All with the help of oil and coal. Not one climate change enthusiast walks the walk. All are total hypocrites.
3757 2018-05-10 17:44:40 If B C doesn’t want oil don’t give them any ! Let them drive electric cars and use electric heat !
3758 2018-05-10 17:44:29 Oil is not a renewable resource. That’s not an opinion, it’s a fact. Switching over to renewable energy sources is inevitable, there will literally come a day when there is no more oil so we have to start switching over now before that day comes.
3759 2018-05-10 17:44:12 Wouldn't this be forced labor? 

I'm not completely opposed to the community service idea. 

The thought of forcing people to go into warzones is disgusting. It's my life and I'd refuse to risk it unless the cause was just. Not just oil.
3760 2018-05-10 17:44:01 @Essar @Essar_Oil Essar petrol pumps has not fuel in distt. Hathras. I visited 3 of fuel stations of essar group Plzz kindly look into for emergency services they should have fuels.
3761 2018-05-10 17:43:58 -the beekeepers approached the hives with shaven heads, as the bees reacted very violently to the smell of perfumed oil applied to the hair. No protective gear and they relied on smoke blown into the hives to keep the bees peaceful. 
-Yes, there are bees in the rainforest.

3765 2018-05-10 17:43:40 If he freely joined, which I guarantee you he did, then he joined an organization that has physically invaded countries for the last fifty years.  The military is a tool to lower oil prices and keep American economic interests safe at the cost of minority lives.

3767 2018-05-10 17:43:27 What gives Israel the right? That's the kind of entitlement that makes people so hostile toward Israel. Iran were invited by Syria to stop its country being ripped apart by the West and its allies in order to plunder its oil wealth & put pressure on Iran. You should realise that
3768 2018-05-10 17:43:27 Agg, don't you just wanna be a doll and borrow me an auxiliary cable I can use on my beats while I burn the midnight oil tonight? @Moose_013 or your brother perhaps? Pretty please?? Promise to give it back.
3769 2018-05-10 17:43:25 How the hell does pulling out of a peaceful denuclearization agreement prevent war or stabilize gas prices? We don’t import Iranian oil to begin with because of the exact agreement #Twitler pulled us out of /put the sanctions on Iranian oil

3774 2018-05-10 17:42:56 This sincere and captivating oil painting by Mian Situ titled, “The Heiress’s Closet”, is a new arrival to the gallery. It is swiftly becoming a favorite of the team. (4 images)
3775 2018-05-10 17:42:54 Pulling out of the Iran Deal assures they can develop nukes, and was only applauded by those countries heavily involved in oil production. Hmmmmm. . Gee, who benefitted from that? Ready to pay $4.00 per gallon???
3776 2018-05-10 17:42:52 Cannabis. Not kidding, my insomnia and stomach issues are almost nil at this point. You can buy 3% CBD oil at any health food store in Texas. No high, just the health benefits.

3780 2018-05-10 17:42:19 I guess try to see if high ABV (90%+)  rubbing alcohol works without damaging the clear coat and the underlying plastic.

3784 2018-05-10 17:41:09 IMO days of the ayatollahs are numbered. May be 10’s days, 100’s of days, or a few yrs but once new sanctions on #Iran go into effect, it’s economy will crash. USA & Saudi Arabia should ratchet up oil/gas production to drive down prices since oil is only thing keeping them afloat

3786 2018-05-10 17:40:40 NK russia and china all back iran the deal was working until tiny hands, gwb's war criminals, big oil, and Israel told him to back out so the can go to war and make money off oil.
3787 2018-05-10 17:40:37 Polite request - mention the importance of the primary elections. You only mentioned Nov 6th. 

Example: @paulajean2018 was awesome on the environment but @JoeManchinWV (fracking, coal, oil) will likely end up being senator again b/c not enough people showed up for the primaries.

3789 2018-05-10 17:40:30 I think oil is a decent short here, the price has benefited from almost 100% positive news the past month. Difficult to see whats driving it from here. $3-4 downside is reasonable to expect.
3790 2018-05-10 17:40:17 According to Bureau of Labor Statistics, approx. 4,500 American men die each year drilling the oil that keeps you warm, providing food and goods you buy at the store, stopping criminals intent to harm you and building shelters that keep you dry.

3797 2018-05-10 17:39:23 Should have saved the articles that said oil may go to 20 $ a few years back. Now with the momentum some claim 100$. So much for data analysis !

3821 2018-05-10 17:37:16 I just followed you back. I'll get back to you with questions, I'm sure to have them. The oil on Amazon is legal? Sorry, I'm n of familiar with the abbreviations. Cystic fibrosis?

3823 2018-05-10 17:36:25 Pro-tip: if you cook sweet potato ribbons with garlic, olive oil and chicken, and finish with bone broth, it will almost taste like teriyaki and for one brief moment maybe a paleo life is worth living. But probably not.
3824 2018-05-10 17:36:15 How long does it take to get an oil change; sheesh

3827 2018-05-10 17:35:58 What was your longer term forecast for oil last year? I believe it was "lower for longer", so just goes to show how valid that was.
3828 2018-05-10 17:35:48 Why does it take over an hour for an oil change everywhere except my usual mechanic
3829 2018-05-10 17:35:36 @AskThePolice question ? if a bus leaks oil on the road over a 10 mile trip and causes a accident due to the oil on the road , who is responsible for the accident , the police confirmed the bus  was to blame but the bus company say they are not responsible whos right

3831 2018-05-10 17:35:35 they did have a full EV version of that car but an oil company patent trolling brought all IP etc and they will not allow anyone to manufacture any of the batteries - it very hard to fix or recondition old batteries due to it a special type of wet chemical battery they used
3832 2018-05-10 17:35:30 Ewwww! Look at the sediment in the used oil! That can't be good....
3833 2018-05-10 17:35:27 Israel is annexing huge chunks of Syria (and stealing Syrian oil), they already occupy the Golan Heights

Iran was asked by the Syrian government to move their army in

3836 2018-05-10 17:35:05 Where is your source? So far, Trump hasn't done a thing to pay back Russians. From opening up more American oil fields, the expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats, export weapons and coal to Ukraine,  sanctions against 19 Russian individuals & 5 Russian organizations. Pro Russia, NOT
3837 2018-05-10 17:35:04 what the tax cuts giveth, the oil man taketh.

3840 2018-05-10 17:34:38 Unfortunately I’m watching an oil painting dry, and that can take weeks.... but it is going to be far more interesting than watching a ‘petit’ criminal dribble on.
3841 2018-05-10 17:34:22 Higher oil prices help Russia.
3842 2018-05-10 17:34:19 America heading to 25trillion debt by trumps end of term.  Retail doing rubbish, wages poor, companies not quite on target, Iran issues , oil getting more expense with little wage growth.  BOOMING stock market , think melt up big fall ...
3843 2018-05-10 17:33:42 As Naija celebrates the increase in oil prices, the UK driver pays more at the pump.  Are we ready to pay 630 today and 750 tomorrow for fuel ?  When we compare, we have to look at all angles
3844 2018-05-10 17:33:40 How long before we start blaming speculators for high oil prices?
3845 2018-05-10 17:33:19 $10 in oil to keep it going btw

3847 2018-05-10 17:32:57 I feel your pain.  But if they’re not following you back, just cut them loose for now.  You can always follow back later.  If an account is REALLY personally important or a VIP, keep them.  But cutting loose the majority who don’t follow back will allow you to keep adding.
3848 2018-05-10 17:32:47 @DRemin9629 -Yes, of course our 'allies backed' the deal. But their interest is economical, ie: OIL. Ours on the other hand is the burden of world leadership, ie: defending them from attack by the same rogue despots. No more Bush/Obama-esque bowing to self-serving 'allies."
3849 2018-05-10 17:32:46 I need a oil change so badly

3853 2018-05-10 17:32:21 There's no shame in carrying your beard oil or Utility Balm with you throughout the day. You could also keep a jar at your desk for some midday moisturizing.
3854 2018-05-10 17:32:17 We have to rid ourselves of thirst for oil. Only way
3855 2018-05-10 17:32:12 The fact that you even get oil changes is a positive and twice a year on the rotations is good enough
3856 2018-05-10 17:32:10 It's good time for india and china to get a good deal for Iranian oil.
3857 2018-05-10 17:32:02 #Iran wants to exploite  rich ground with gas/oil..about time they can.. have a pipeline through #Syria...to do business wit #Europe  .thats why #US+#Saoedies+#Israel are pissed off..the want the sole power in the Middle East, sanction Iran for ever and be the only nucleair power
3858 2018-05-10 17:31:55 Leaving the agreement intact wouldn’t have raised oil prices and helped the Russians.
3859 2018-05-10 17:31:52 $PPR.to dip testing the cloud as support right now - funny how oil has a slightly red day and some of these plays drop over 10% ... I guess it's a good time to load if you are still bullish on them though. Thoughts @JMaserati
3860 2018-05-10 17:31:47 It sure there first mistake is the olive oil

3865 2018-05-10 17:31:19 Wow!! That's horrible! Well CBD oil has no thc in it so it should be legal. You can even order it through Amazon. You should give it a try! I'm sorry that you're suffering and the laws there are insanely tough. I lived in Texas for 1.5 years.

3874 2018-05-10 17:30:48 Just because its virgin olive oil doesn’t mean you must use a whole 200 litre drum of it in your stew 
3875 2018-05-10 17:30:46 Dude complaining about "snake oil salesmen in crypto" uses terms "Society 3.0" and "Society 4.0" seriously.
3876 2018-05-10 17:30:46 GS: the unusually large current gap between PPI and CPI airfare inflation (+8.8pp) would argue for a rebound in the latter this summer, particularly given surging oil prices.
3877 2018-05-10 17:30:42 Lets get this perfectly straight
Iran has had the UK and the US meddling in its affairs since 1900 when Oil was first found. We have changed their regime, killed maimed and assaulted their populace and they still haven't sent terrorists to assassinate the Queen.
Leave 'em alone!!

3880 2018-05-10 17:30:26 That's how modern tax systems work: people who earn more pay more tax.  AB has an income problem because we've built our system on low oil royalties, & those royalties are going away.  Putting the tax burden on lower income people isn't a great solution.

3885 2018-05-10 17:30:04 It’s raining out, my car is audibly reminding me I need an oil change, and I’m about to get Chic-fil-A.

You?
3886 2018-05-10 17:29:50 Spot on my friend, you are wiser then me when it comes to investments and markets if anything happens I'll be checking with you as to where I need to put my money Lol. On a serious note I really hope this does'nt escalate further, tired of seeing young kids (troops) die for oil
3887 2018-05-10 17:29:48 I never said that, you did. If you don't approve of it, don't use it. Otherwise, you're a hypocrite. The industry calls it oil sands. Earth muffins like you prefer to use words that are derogatory to further your pathetic cause. In other words, you use it as a marketing term
3888 2018-05-10 17:29:43 The TRUTH is out
Putin gave Trump those hostages as a distraction from the REAL story
The cancelling of the Iran deal was Putins play all along
Russia will now make billions in oil revenue
3889 2018-05-10 17:29:36 @romanet_carol @realDonaldTrump  Hey Donnie, Thanks for the hike in oil prices and the accelerated conflict with Israel, Iran and Syria.This careless pulling out of the Iran Deal seems like a set up to start a war.Who’s paying you off for this move?
3890 2018-05-10 17:29:30 Thought today couldn't any worse until I came home and mixed up my shampoo with my conditioner, gunna look like I poured a layer of oil all over my hair :))
3891 2018-05-10 17:29:16 Where can I get that baby oil they comes in a spray bottle? Or are those exclusive?
3892 2018-05-10 17:29:16 Oatmeal is Outstanding w/Coconut Oil, Nuts, Cranberries, Quinoa & Cinnamon!
3893 2018-05-10 17:29:12 Before the oil
3894 2018-05-10 17:29:09 Because the long-term trend seems to be against oil: with more renewables, there’s less demand for oil. And once Libya, Iran, Venezuela get their act together, the oil supply will soar.
3895 2018-05-10 17:29:07 The days of oil profiteering glory during the Dubya Administration are BACK!
3896 2018-05-10 17:29:07 breaking news:  fracking is a flash, the permian basin a humbug, hugh oil reserve bubble
3897 2018-05-10 17:29:02 Yep, that dangerous oil they have in the Middle East a threat to US security.
3898 2018-05-10 17:29:02 Ok enough already the world hates Alberta crude.Has nothing to do with the US being able to control Canada’s ability to sell its oil at a market price.The US buys Canadian oil at a discount then sells it at a massive bargain.If Canadacould export more it could sell less to the US
3899 2018-05-10 17:28:57 I'm not talking godfatherism here but the fact that we are never interested in Civil service then. Everyone wanted the Bank, Oil and Gas jobs disdaining civil service. That's the issue not godfatherism
3900 2018-05-10 17:28:55 Enjoying painting this conservatory 
Lots of prep due to some tired weathered wood, but good hardened wood filler then an oil base primer/undercoat in matching colour for top coat then two coats of that oil base gloss on top
That should last a few years
3901 2018-05-10 17:28:55 There is nothing "dirty" about tar sands, that was a smear campaign from many years ago. The anti-oil stance for Canada is politically motivated by hypocrites like yourself to ease the path so foreign conflict oil can flow in uninhibited

3905 2018-05-10 17:28:22 2) So, there's a new place in Dallas that supposed to be found the oil. Then, they direct you to the Government page, where they say it's illegal and we'd be prosecuted. It's all too confusing!
3906 2018-05-10 17:28:21 Out of all the replies to a retarded original tweet written by a literal scam artist criminal, you win top prize for the most nonsensical one yet! First of all, why would Assad or Putin be happy if US strikes Iran? As for oil, US will be #1 world oil producer within 4-6 months.
3907 2018-05-10 17:28:21 UK together with US already overthrew a legitimate + very popular Iranian President, Mossadegh in 1953. They staged a coup d'État + it was clearly for BP's control of oil in Iran at the time. Outrageous, really! And this guy Bolton is a  dangerous, unstable fanatic!
3908 2018-05-10 17:28:13 Nak cleansing oil 
3909 2018-05-10 17:28:11 Appears this was the plan all along. Pulling out of the Iran treaty to raise oil prices and America pays for the sanctions and saves Putin's ass.
3910 2018-05-10 17:28:11 Just curious if any doctor or professional has suggested medical MJ oil? I believe it’s now available for those who suffer from seizures in GA. Hope he gets the help he needs, either way.

3918 2018-05-10 17:27:16 If Alberta does well so does the rest of Canada, the rest of the provinces can complain about us while they line up to collect the added revenue generated by the oil patch.

3921 2018-05-10 17:26:42 Now that you terminated the deal oil prices will go up and Putin will be happy to make more money selling oil for a higher price. Looks to me that this was the actual reason because Iran kept their promise regarding nuclear weapons. Not saying they are the good guys!
3922 2018-05-10 17:26:37 Most consumers don't read the ingredients of the goods they buy, and they don't know what they're eating when they eat out. By the time they know what palm oil is, where it can be found, and understand the impact, it will be too late. Government can do this well.

3926 2018-05-10 17:26:12 K
3927 2018-05-10 17:26:09 Relying on crisis in other countries to bolster oil prices so you can attempt to balance a budget is foolish. Even $100 PPB will not be enough. Rather than speculating about what may save us, why don’t we: (1) create a revenue stream & (2) diversify.
3928 2018-05-10 17:26:05 Need to do in oil change on my car but I want to go get my nails done
3929 2018-05-10 17:25:54 Oil prices were already going up if you didn't notice. As the price rises fracking will increase & put a curb on the rise. Also I do not doubt the other oil producers will increase production, lowering the price. Besides which, don't you lib's want the price of oil to go up?

But if you believe the Syrian govt., out of sheer evil or insanity, attacks its own schools, hospitals & civilians, you're wrong.

4026 2018-05-10 17:14:55 If anyone is to blame for the problems with Iran, there are 3 people who were responsible. Eisenhower, and both Dulles brothers, along with the Brits for overthrowing the Iranian democratic and secular government in 1953 and installing the Shah as it's leader. In the name of oil.
4027 2018-05-10 17:14:52 Buena nota, Simon. Como encaja esto con que todos los pronósticos reflejen un crecimiento en consumo de gas y petróleo en los próximos años? (AIE, por ejemplo, no ve peak oil demand hasta 2040). El plan energético propuesto sería una especie de “all of the above”?
4028 2018-05-10 17:14:48 RT the Russian TV has announced good news, all of Putin's new economic measures are coming to fruition thanks to the White House. The revenue that will save Putin's ass from the wolves will be coming from the oil price boost due to the US pulling out of the Iran deal. Putin's man

4035 2018-05-10 17:14:25 And Investers are happy as oil stocks rise!  Once again the consumers are screwed but Trumpzillas have yet to figure this out.  their tiny raise won't be enough for the higher gas and food prices.
4036 2018-05-10 17:14:16 Some observers see correlation between oil prices & nuclear demand but really it is NatGas prices that are most related. As NatGas prices rise it makes gas-fired power plants more expensive to operate & uranium-fired nuclear more attractive = incentive to keep nuclear running.
4037 2018-05-10 17:14:10 T-Rump's destruction of the Iran Nuclear deal -- one of the most successful arms control deals in modern history -- is nothing more than shredding diplomacy for spite. There is no positive gain there (unless it's the bank balances of Big Oil)...!

4130 2018-05-10 17:07:11 So far they’ve kept it. There is no proof they violated it. This isn’t about that. It’s about imposing sanctions to raise the price of oil - helping trump, his inner circle, and even Russia make more money.

Hope West realizes that Trump withdrawal from nuclear proliferation agreement and sanctions against Iran will result in increase of oil prices which is exactly what Putin needs now.
Low oil prices are damaging Russian economy badly
4146 2018-05-10 17:05:30 You're a fucking idiot. Jimmy Carter called the Shah our greatest ally and suffered politically from the aftermath of the revolution (economy and oil prices.) the US installed the shah in the 50s. That was when we screwed up

4149 2018-05-10 17:05:20 That is huge. Really huge. But if we maintain financial discipline and oil remains above $70 for a long period, it is doable. If you add a visionary and focused govt frenzily investing in infrastructure, then our children have some hope
4150 2018-05-10 17:05:19 I roasted a chicken having marinaded it in an asian inspired mix (mustard, soy sauce, garlic, ginger, sesame oil, honey) and then with the leftovers I made it into a salad with an asian dressing (olive oil, honey, ginger, soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil) It was yummy!
4151 2018-05-10 17:05:18 I love how the left is complaining about gas prices & blaming it on Trump for pulling out of Iran...

Maybe if Obama didn't rush to rid the Gulf of oil following the Deepwater Horizon incident we would be more dependent on our own, like he campaigned on

4176 2018-05-10 17:03:52 Also "Gas has spiked in recent weeks due mainly to increasing oil prices as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) maintains strict production limits despite global economic growth." This is the main driver.

4178 2018-05-10 17:03:48 So this is the behind the scenes negotiating with the Russians to put Iran back in line. We can collapse your energy market in oil and natural gas as well in nuclear reactors. If you want a Russian economy, stop the BS.

4185 2018-05-10 17:03:18 Ok, I understand now. Yes, that's necessary. If the Fed did not "print" money, the economy would crash. Money is the oil that greases the engine of capital. As the engine grows, more money needs to be in circulation. Otherwise, the economy would freeze up (disinflation).

4230 2018-05-10 17:00:19 Coconut oil melts at 75- degrees.

*looks at jar of coconut oil on my desk at work, sweating*

Why the fuck is it 75-degrees (or hotter) in my office???
4231 2018-05-10 17:00:09 Peppermint oil is so strong it's ridiculous.

4233 2018-05-10 16:59:52 I think it’s more than thAt it’s a total unwillingness to contemplate anything other than the legitimisation of the occupation . Our governments the Gulf oil producing states also complicit
4234 2018-05-10 16:59:23 Not to confident though, you better stop and check the oil often
4235 2018-05-10 16:59:22 5. When enough US oil is pulled from the ground, prices will come down
In a mean time economic independence will grow, companies profits rise - workers will feel immediate rise in hiring and wage increases, GDP growth accelerates, the dead will begin to go down
4236 2018-05-10 16:58:57 File under non-shocking news: Oil prices are rising after the US quits the Iran deal. Good for investors, not so much for consumers.

4239 2018-05-10 16:58:46 With crude oil prices close to 80 dollars,FG should consider selling next years production forward and lock in this price. This will guarantee  oil revenues and avoid the distraction of setting budget benchmarks with the NASS next year.
4240 2018-05-10 16:58:43 iran was following the deal this about oil and trump and big oil making money.

4242 2018-05-10 16:58:20 This idiot is the reason why the Shah was overthrown to begin with. Just because he raised the price of oil and Western countries didn't like that they actually had to pay for it starting in 1976.

4244 2018-05-10 16:58:15 For the person wondering how this will affect all of us?Have you looked at the gas prices lately?The oil industry experts are predicting between $4-4.50/gallon this summer all because of some Trumped up crisis in the middle east created by the one whose name must never be spoken.
4245 2018-05-10 16:58:11 Everyone knows I love coconut oil. Yasssss I love that shit

Also, I'm sure your uncle Earle's hip replacement wasn't from his secret Santa.
4275 2018-05-10 16:55:37 Russia profits from higher oil. Therefore speculation off of #IranNuclearDeal boosted Russian economy.
4276 2018-05-10 16:55:28 You realize we don’t get oil from there.
4277 2018-05-10 16:55:26 New cars do not overheat unless of course they get old or poorly maintained or the wrong engine oil classification and filter are used like we do all the time in Nigeria.
4278 2018-05-10 16:55:24 I see Russia and Israel were jumping for joy when you broke the. Agreement.  Putin will be pleased with you now oil prices will go through the roof and he can sell Iran as many weapons as he likes.   You have been a good boy for him your Not off the hook yet he still wants more

As soon as oil is higher than approximately $55 a barrel(never mind $100 )fracking producers will have/ had a ‘field’ day
Drilling new wells, exploration and production cost down,  meaning additional employment opportunities...
4294 2018-05-10 16:53:58 oooh black garlic oil? ill have to keep my eye out
4295 2018-05-10 16:53:58 US produces the most oil in the world... 

This whole argument screams two things to me A. Let’s stop fucking the environment B. The opportunities of alt energy
4296 2018-05-10 16:53:54 Yes, 50 years ago, when Israel was half of what it was on the map today, and most Arabs in this world weren't literate. Now, most Arabs speak two or more languages and have the support of Russia and a near infinite budget due to oil revenue. What does Israel have? Ukrainians?

4302 2018-05-10 16:53:25 Now due to Gulf issue oil price will go up, then same people's reaction
4303 2018-05-10 16:53:11 It's a big game played by Saudis and Israelis against Iran. Putin will react on his own time as Put in very much reply on high oil prices. Russia is largest oil producer after Saudi. So they have huge stakes in this too.
4304 2018-05-10 16:53:07 Anyone know a good face cleanser ? Need to get this oil out of my face 
4305 2018-05-10 16:53:07 My point is, why must that money be pulled instead of, say, subsidies for oil companies? Money is being removed from a program that helps kids get healthcare. It's a dick move no matter what you call it, especially when that money could have come from taxes from the rich.
4306 2018-05-10 16:53:00 That's where it needs to stay te curb, because if you drive it it will use oil!
4307 2018-05-10 16:52:59 Will Investors Now Sell Cabot Oil & Gas (NYSE:COG) Stock Following Today’s, BofA Merrill Downgrade...
4308 2018-05-10 16:52:58 I would also reinforce that the temperature of the heat is extremely important in considering this. Olive oil is great for baking but not at temperatures such as those for wok sauteing
4309 2018-05-10 16:52:56 I’d argue Russia is just as unstable and untrustworthy under Putin. 

Also, Iran supplies a ton of oil. Not at level of Russia or Saudi. But price uptick alone makes keeping them involved logical.
4310 2018-05-10 16:52:53 Hmmm...Facts only.
Oil boom started in 1973, review FG budget till '79.
When hostile NPN took over, IBB/Abacha moved FG out in '96
4311 2018-05-10 16:52:44 I got 4 oil changes left for the free so it’s extra lit.
4312 2018-05-10 16:52:37 It’s more than that. Cancelling the JCPOA will cause, is causing global oil prices to rise. Oil is Russia’s primary source of income. It’s an end run around sanctions

4320 2018-05-10 16:52:06 That oil that comes with it 
4321 2018-05-10 16:51:56 If and when America becomes a power player in the world oil market we’ll not see these spikes. Also with the dollar tied to a barrel of oil it’s even more important America controls the fluctuations
4322 2018-05-10 16:51:55 USA and Israel are illegally occupying the majority of Syrian land. 

But if you watch the ((((media)))) in America you will never know this.

4339 2018-05-10 16:49:58 Guess we are too stupid to know what we want.  The polls said we should stay in.  And Plan B is?  Russia gets higher oil prices, American drivers pay more, Israel meets with Russia, bombs Iranians in Syria after being bombed.  Hardliners in Iran gain.  What could go wrong?

4352 2018-05-10 16:49:11 Unless you want to start a world war trying to kick out one of the largest oil suppliers isn’t going to happen. Then allowing an unstable country like Iran put 300 mill barrels a day on the market almost over night then cutting it off destabilizes everything

4361 2018-05-10 16:48:42 It'd cause chaos (and I'm no expert either) because companies would be unable to respond and act if they instantly had to stop using Iranian oil, takes time to figure out exactly where what they're buying comes from, what their liability is, how to unload if possible, etc.
4362 2018-05-10 16:48:42 Another perk of owning a gmc, you get to add oil at a rapid pace!
4363 2018-05-10 16:48:39 Sanction on Iranian  oil export. Saudi have already boost their oil production to fill the expected gap and offered Americans for cheaper oil. Supply will suffer and ultimately oil glut will end. Prices r already at 75$/barrel.  May go at 100$ if situation with Iran Israel worsen
4364 2018-05-10 16:48:38 Stop using gas central-heating  and driving a combustion vehicle that uses petroleum oil out of the ground, the world would just grind to a holt no fuel for vehicles or planes, plastic in the sea killing fish n birds
Ur bottled water has nano particles of plastic within the water
4365 2018-05-10 16:48:30 Just tell that no oil touches these thighs of yours So no butter and lite salt
4366 2018-05-10 16:48:17 It will have a different impact on a "healtier" more diverse economy but, don't attack the oil industry, to try and defend/promote your political views - which are not even that, you just hate the party that saw through you, that's all.

4370 2018-05-10 16:47:59 Then I need a whole oil change
4371 2018-05-10 16:47:57 We won’t be complacent on oil price rise, Adeosun tells W/Bank - Vanguard News -
4372 2018-05-10 16:47:56 Go to get an oil change, leave with everything else needing to be fixed on my car too 
4373 2018-05-10 16:47:53 Or Putin is pulling the strings to make Trump look good and maybe get the oil sanctions removed and a nice war started so everyone can be rolling in cash.
4374 2018-05-10 16:47:41 もうわがんね
4375 2018-05-10 16:47:41 If I knew how to precisely weight all the various factors, I'd probably be in the oil trading business...
4376 2018-05-10 16:47:40 Bhatti sab do u know any thing about prevailing oil prices and its link with LNG.. Any financial sector experience and valuation methodology do u ever gone through. No... So stop giving us this shit again and again @MaryamNSharif
4377 2018-05-10 16:47:35 If anyone ever recommends neem oil to you, punch them in the face.
4378 2018-05-10 16:47:34 Might be a good idea, before Mother's day. "A candle! thanks, what scent?" "60k mile rear diff oil"
4379 2018-05-10 16:47:30 Government ain't got no money for free health care or free public college. 

But they do have bomb money for wars were not even a part of, building prisons, trillion dollar bank bail outs, 160 billion increases to the military, and billion dollar oil subsidies @JimmyDoreShow
4380 2018-05-10 16:47:28 Hmmm, I'll mull it over ...
4381 2018-05-10 16:47:08 100% VITAMIN E OIL. 

Like pure. No mix from like Trader Joe’s or whatever. That’s a waste.
Get the thick one from like Whole Foods or beauty supply. Or a place that sells natural oils.
4382 2018-05-10 16:47:08 Leaving Iran Deal without a Peace plan, places Middle East and World at great risk of nuclear proliferation and War, it empowers Saudi Arabia and Russia with great power over oil Reserves! Increased gas prices will harm average citizens but help oil producers! Poor will be poorer
4383 2018-05-10 16:47:02 "fine person, better than most kids" ... sure, if you set aside her selling out her country and all for mere stories, propaganda, olive oil, and mommy!! lolol
4384 2018-05-10 16:47:02 Ruble is usually far more impacted by oil price movements than by geopolitics. The drop after April 6 sanctions was an exception.
4385 2018-05-10 16:46:58 That Saturday Night Live Studio- elected, Arsenio wouldn't be reimbursed with oil!--fundraiser linked to loan program.
4386 2018-05-10 16:46:48 For dry skin, use a mixture of baby oil and epsom salt. Rub into skin then shower.
4387 2018-05-10 16:46:47 Scroll Facebook and saw some people want to abolish GST, Penang bridge tol, and to decrease the oil price altogether just because Tun M already sworn in as the new PM, and I truly dont understand what's in their mind, how their mind work though
4388 2018-05-10 16:46:42 These 3 men are lying their asses off. Those brave Soldiers were there protecting ExxonMobil Oil.
4389 2018-05-10 16:46:39 @MexicanAndyCx  tell pepper generator needs oil to running
4390 2018-05-10 16:46:38 Yeah my dr said stop smoking pot to see if anxiety medicine works but the anxiety medicine gave me a panic attack so I’m going back to weed and CBD oil
4391 2018-05-10 16:46:26 I was super disappointed. I also thought the chili oil was weirdly flavorless. And the pan fried bao were just a huge let down.
4392 2018-05-10 16:46:12 they sell acne dots at CVS and burt’s bee’s tea tree oil usually does the trick!! or you could try witch hazel!! and ice or eye drops can help reduce the redness!!!
4393 2018-05-10 16:46:07 He is his dad got oil money
4394 2018-05-10 16:45:45 Waiting for my oil change to be done so I went to go eat bought some random stuff from the 99 then some movies and shirts from goodwill and that only took up 30 minutes 
4395 2018-05-10 16:45:44 Take it back kid, it probably uses to much oil also!
4396 2018-05-10 16:45:31 Next a phone booth with a cab of oil to the side.
4397 2018-05-10 16:45:15 Don't go to far, uses to much oil for that! And they refuse to repair under warranty!

4400 2018-05-10 16:45:00 Well I feel like he just can't destroy the sword himself. Like oil and water don't mix.
4401 2018-05-10 16:44:59 O sea q con la quiebra de OIL Combustibles recuperamos mierda, monedas, casi NADA de lo q deberíamos recuperar!!
Alguien q me de un Valium..
4402 2018-05-10 16:44:52 I need avocado and olive oil. What is this life?
4403 2018-05-10 16:44:51 Alberta has an oil crisis.
4404 2018-05-10 16:44:46 Just exactly the same as Scotland. They'll try to keep a grip on us as long as they can use OUR oil as a bargaining chip. It also helps to keep the "major power" myth alive.
4405 2018-05-10 16:44:39 Gas companies trippin.. no way gas is $2.99 rn

What oil rig went under water to cause this to happen? There hasn't been any natural disasters like earth quakes or hurricanes.. whats the gig u greedy bastards??
4406 2018-05-10 16:44:35 2. Winners:
Saudi Arabia and other Gulf producers - MbS can really fulfill his Vision 2030 projects( break even price for oil for KSA is around $70 a barrel)
Russia - break even price is around $60 
This is huge $transfusion for Russian sinking economy
This will solidify...
4407 2018-05-10 16:44:31 i love getting massages but i hate the part where ur all oil n gross???? 
4408 2018-05-10 16:44:28 Waiting for my beard to grow a little longer then finally using my WSP barbershop oil!

4410 2018-05-10 16:44:20 And your use of oil, not covered under warranty
4411 2018-05-10 16:44:16 Hey just a reminder to not wash your hair every day! Washing your hair every day makes your scalp dry which causes it to produce more oil! If ya just train your hair you won’t get all oily so fast! Bling bling 
4412 2018-05-10 16:44:16 @sampepper  get oil for generator maybe is that problem
4413 2018-05-10 16:44:11 Meanwhile we got the oil trade with Europe going like we started under Obama, got oil expansion with trump there for environmentalists to blame.  All the inflation blame goes on trump.  All the cuts to government spending...  Again, on trump

Always look at the end game
4414 2018-05-10 16:44:07 Welp
Time to make the oil fire worse with water
4415 2018-05-10 16:44:04 I aint tryna pay for no oil change lol
4416 2018-05-10 16:43:58 Simply because there will be less oil on the market.
4417 2018-05-10 16:43:54 I be this old GMC uses less oil than their new ones! Not repaired under warranty
4418 2018-05-10 16:43:47 Try cbd oil good luck to u both hope u make it home soon
4419 2018-05-10 16:43:46 Well, if you are giving out credit... you must show the blame too:
Increased oil prices when he cancelled Iran deal.
Killed billions of soybean sales with trade war.
Caused our allies to criticize us.

Are we winning yet, asshole?

4425 2018-05-10 16:43:24 But the rising oil/gas prices will certainly help his pal Vlad. So how do you like using your newfound tax "cut" to pay more for gas, #Trumpers?
4426 2018-05-10 16:43:11 Because higher oil price
4427 2018-05-10 16:43:09 Remind me to the time I played with Scala Electric cars in the sixties  And to make the tracks more difficult we put olive oil on it.
4428 2018-05-10 16:43:05 I Don't Use Lotion, I Use Oil 
4429 2018-05-10 16:43:00 Why is the TRaitor wrong?  So many reason's so little time.  The blacklash started immediately. Billions lost by companies (jobs lost 2 Americans) military actions taken in Mid East, China moving in to Iraq for oil.  

So little time 4 answers.
4430 2018-05-10 16:42:55 Bank of America: World oil price could hit $100 a barrel next year -
4431 2018-05-10 16:42:52 Your return to the Truck Series in the #89 for ThorSport.

4436 2018-05-10 16:42:03 Don't do it, they use so much oil they may blow up before you make it out!
4437 2018-05-10 16:42:02 Lol I scheduled an oil change, and Im now sitting in the dealer getting it done, tomorrow I have a doctors appointment I scheduled on my own, at a doctors office, I found on my own
4438 2018-05-10 16:41:56 Xi is pulling the strings on Korea.  Putin is too busy playing Trump to throw the Middle East into chaos to push up oil prices, and divide the US from it's allies.  Happy days for the enemies of the US thanks to the Dotard in Chief.
4439 2018-05-10 16:41:48 so who really was behind the peanut oil thing?
4440 2018-05-10 16:41:45 Running in the truck series at Eldora!
4441 2018-05-10 16:41:45 .@SecretaryZinke: selling off the #ArcticRefuge to oil & gas polluters is irresponsible and immoral. #ProtectTheArctic #NoArcticLeases
4442 2018-05-10 16:41:41 So what are equity boys watching. The rising Dow or the rising rupee, INR yields and oil? Price action is perplexing!
4443 2018-05-10 16:41:33 Rico running around on the atv at Grandview last year on 7/4 during PA Speedweek...   I'm thinking,  "whos this guy... the only one who wants to see whats going on with the track prep?   He's gonna be good 2nite"
4444 2018-05-10 16:41:25 .@SecretaryZinke: drilling in the #ArcticRefuge wouldn’t be safe or harmless. How do we know? The countless oil spills that take place in our country every year.  #ProtectTheArctic #NoArcticLeases

4447 2018-05-10 16:41:18 Sunburn + Cannabis Oil = Magic 

#CannabisOil #CannabisIsMedicine #sunburn #Magic #PlantMedicine
4448 2018-05-10 16:41:18 Even so, I think we'll start to see an even further increase in price of oil and gas as a direct consequence of pulling out of the deal.
4449 2018-05-10 16:41:15 Total-Tip for the Day -  Check your brake system annually, but always check your brake lining, rotors and drums whenever you go for an oil change. #totalAutoshow. 

#TotalQuartz Keep Your Engine For Longer
4450 2018-05-10 16:41:13 "Please God, give us another oil boom, we promise not to p*** it away this time." Seriously? Since you are quoting, can you show us the individual that uses that prayer? If that's how you perceive Albertans, you may have met some very mediocre folks so far.
4451 2018-05-10 16:41:13 Apa cuma aku yg klo bersihin mekap gak pernah pake baby oil atau micellar water atau makeup remover? Langsung aja gitu make sabun cuci muka wkwk
4452 2018-05-10 16:41:07 Use CBD oil. Stops seizures in seconds.

4454 2018-05-10 16:40:55 It didn't smell all that great as well like burning oil. It was pretty crazy o.o

4456 2018-05-10 16:40:48 Is there a place in your pot of hot oil for him?

4458 2018-05-10 16:40:45 I used an essential oil designed to put you up to this!!
4459 2018-05-10 16:40:42 Good stuff
For those wanting a serious read about the Middle East and the Oil history of the West I recommend"The Prize" by Daniel Yergin.
4460 2018-05-10 16:40:36 Mansfield Motor Speedway. Dealing with the flat and driving from the back to finish P9. You were the one to watch prior to the last 3 laps. You put on a show within the show. Looking forward to an Eldora win this weekend! We’ll be there!
4461 2018-05-10 16:40:32 What do you mean? I said Rothschild and Cheney can’t wait to stop drilling for oil lmao. Since you’re so educated you know that they aspire to build a pipeline from Arabia to Europe and both have started drilling in SYRIA already. Another place we jus HAVE to interfere in.
4462 2018-05-10 16:40:29 見回り行ってきまーす！
4463 2018-05-10 16:40:24 Got damn oil change is $80  bruh.

4466 2018-05-10 16:40:10 @ScottWapnerCNBC didn’t markets make new highs around October 2007 with oil in the 90’s?
4467 2018-05-10 16:40:03 They want Irans oil
He said as much during that speech to the FBI when he stood in front of that wall of fallen agents. Or should I say Putin wants control and Trump is going to help him.
4468 2018-05-10 16:39:54 Oil at 4 year high
4469 2018-05-10 16:39:50 To bad they will consume so much oil and then not be covered under warranty! And they do not put anything in writing so they can deny deny deny!
4470 2018-05-10 16:39:39 Or perhaps by the Iranian oil exports being blocked, prices go up for Russian oil.  And profits for Putin are bigly.  Win/Win for some, lose/lose for the rest of us.
4471 2018-05-10 16:39:38 Pendeen Cres, Snelshall East - update
The clean up of a large amount of fly tipping has started however there are multiple amounts of different waste like oil and glass which need specialist clean up crews. Please avoid the area until the clear up is complete
4472 2018-05-10 16:39:34 N*** is about to be cancelled he better stop it with this olive oil nonsense
4473 2018-05-10 16:39:32 MCT Oil - won’t break your fast either.
4474 2018-05-10 16:39:25 So you want gas guzzling cars on the road and no buying oil from Iran, does that mean we’ll be buying from your buddy Putin?
4475 2018-05-10 16:39:11 @PepsiCo must take action to eliminate suppliers who are violating human rights& destroying rainforests.Rainforests continue to fall and workers continue to be exploited for the palm oil in PepsiCo's products and in the operations of your notorious business partner Indofood.
4476 2018-05-10 16:39:10 CALTEX NASD HAHAHAHAHHHAHAHAHAHA ATAY  IKAW SD OY CHANGE OIL NA HAHAHAHAHHAHA
4477 2018-05-10 16:38:58 I need to buy some more miracle drops & Black castor oil.
4478 2018-05-10 16:38:55 Yah right!!!How  about oil?Price of a gallon of gas is the highest it has been in 3 years!!!
4479 2018-05-10 16:38:54 jojoba oil 
4480 2018-05-10 16:38:43 caster oil
4481 2018-05-10 16:38:28 Credit goes to oil
4482 2018-05-10 16:38:22 To bad they use so much oil and they do not fix under warranty
4483 2018-05-10 16:38:14 i actually dont use soap on my face lol. It dries and breaks me out so I just use a white face cloth and warm water. after wearing heavy makeup i do a face mask and after that i spray with tonic water and use Vitamin E oil!
4484 2018-05-10 16:38:12 yawa ka! HAHAHAHAHAH WAY CHANGE OIL!!!! WA KAADTOG SHELL HAHAHHAHAHA 
4485 2018-05-10 16:38:09 A regional war of attrition in the making...! Ultimately oil prices will go up, as well as, defense contracts... The authoritarianism in M.E will increase...!
4486 2018-05-10 16:38:04 Awesome. And in 6 years when the sanctions come off these same people will be complaining about Iranian oil flooding the market.
4487 2018-05-10 16:38:01 The funny thing is if oil really does hit $100, this whole fight over CAFE will really be beside the point.
4488 2018-05-10 16:37:52 Are you sure?

According to international standards rapeseed can be cold pressed or virgin + no standard for extra virgin

4489 2018-05-10 16:37:45 Aku gak pake EVOO buat moisturizer harian. Aku pake EVOO sebagai oil cleanser aja
4490 2018-05-10 16:37:41 Wtf, how ignorant is this. The deal with iran is one of if not the most important peace deals of our time. They have fully complied with the deal according to UN officials. This is going to sky rocket oil prices and could create war. How does this make anything safer?
4491 2018-05-10 16:37:34 Fun fact: the Vatican has endorsed ecologism for the last 50 years. Their stance is that to "care for all the creations of God" is awesome.
Doesn't stop cath. cons. little shits from defending oil by citing the verse in the verse when "god gives earth to man do to as he pleases".
4492 2018-05-10 16:37:30 @KingCountyWA Why are you spending my taxpayer money to sue oil companies over debunked gobal warming fantasy?  This not about science, it is about politics.  Dumb.
4493 2018-05-10 16:37:29 Stinks of oil in the Niger Delta
4494 2018-05-10 16:37:21 So nag oil painting ako kanina...

And i still suck at it 
4495 2018-05-10 16:37:20 First time I ever watched you race.  7/18/2013 @rapidspeedway, got 2nd to @TerryMccarl24 that night.  Awesome race.  Been a fan ever since.
4496 2018-05-10 16:37:16 Explain your support for pulling out of the Iran deal. All other countries are staying in, so we are in no position to enforce sanctions. Oil prices will go up as a result, the petrodollar will weaken, there is now potential for a nuclear arms race in the region, what is better?
4497 2018-05-10 16:37:13 Risk Off !!! Bye bye $USD $Oil . Buy Buy $Gold and Major currencies against #USD

4499 2018-05-10 16:37:02 Watching you almost pull off the win at Eldora. You were really driving that truck like you stole it
4500 2018-05-10 16:37:01 You started a shooting war in the Middle East. Oil prices are way up. Congratulations. Putin must be so proud.
4501 2018-05-10 16:36:55 Are these companies affected by oil price volatility ?
4502 2018-05-10 16:36:54 So much for being handy Mandy

Tried to put oil in my car  ended up spilling all over.
Now my car is smoking 
4503 2018-05-10 16:36:53 Lmfao! It’s like an additional cleanser. Helps minimize your pores and gets rid of excess oil, dirt etc.
4504 2018-05-10 16:36:50 My favorite Rico memory is watching you dominate the USAC Midget feature during 4 Crown in 2016! Was also my first time to Eldora!
4505 2018-05-10 16:36:42 Gee! I wonder why the oil prices are quickly going up!!!
4506 2018-05-10 16:36:39 Lolol. Cast dispersions? Like, you think he's just going to melt into a repugnant oil slick on the water of the USA?

Trying to use vocabulary you're not intellectually equipped for just made you look foolish... As if your comment wasn't enough to do that on its own... #tytlive
4507 2018-05-10 16:36:14 You wouldn't believe the ignorance about all this in car and motorcycle forums (which I follow because that's my industry). People buying new F150s honestly don't know about the petrodollar, much less the petro yuan. They think oil prices are set by Texas refineries.
4508 2018-05-10 16:36:07 Sitting here waiting on my oil to get changed 
4509 2018-05-10 16:36:05 Peppermint essential oil on the nape@of the neck and drink warm water before you take a nap

4513 2018-05-10 16:35:36 Ha that oil rig got me some stress
4514 2018-05-10 16:35:34 Remember Gas Shortages With Carter? Well Tankers Filled With Oil In NY Harbor Buy The Hundreds. What A Dummy

4520 2018-05-10 16:35:12 Oil prices are going up. How does Russia not win? They are tired of winning my friend.
4521 2018-05-10 16:34:53 Watching you win the chilli bowl
4522 2018-05-10 16:34:50 That oil rig got you some gains lol

4525 2018-05-10 16:34:31 Cleaning your boiler is not just about maintaining it. We check for proper operation, change oil filters, check belts, grease bearings, and service the burner. These are all things that need to be done to ensure your boiler is running efficiently and safely.

4528 2018-05-10 16:34:06 Oil prices going up yet u r not sure Russia wins? Gee morty
4529 2018-05-10 16:33:58 I prefer peace and not wars for oil and western run central banks and I prefer the copious amounts of cash being spent on this to be spent at home so that we can better educate people like you on things like geo-politics.
4530 2018-05-10 16:33:58 USA also produces its own crude oil along with buying from Middle East. 
Petrol price today is between Rs 47 - Rs 61.72 per liter

4533 2018-05-10 16:33:45 All oil revenues from Gowon's era were pumped into Lagos big time; from FESTAC town, to the National Theatre, to massive road expansion with all the bridges.
The geese that laid the golden eggs were left to rot away with polluted waters and destroyed farmlands
4534 2018-05-10 16:33:44 Children who learn to think for themselves early stand a greater chance of not being seduced by right (or left) wing politicians selling snake oil.
4535 2018-05-10 16:33:42 My patchouli oil spilt in my purse  dammit
4536 2018-05-10 16:33:33 So when are you going to call for an investigation on the gas and oil companies this is ridiculous to have these prices... People can't afford this and they keep price gouging us Americans... we need a voice...
4537 2018-05-10 16:33:24 I'd have to say the time you helped pull Tim Kaeding from his overturned racecar. You are the man!
4538 2018-05-10 16:33:19 Sauté up onions, green pepper, mushrooms & spinach in grape seed oil with bacon flavoring, then add a couple blended eggs for a yummy egg scramble!!
4539 2018-05-10 16:33:16 If it needs engine oil you obviously pour it all over the engine  
4540 2018-05-10 16:33:09 looking at oil as it goes through possible ending diagnal to 72.25 to 74 area, above 75 will become invalidated. If that happens, new wave account of as X and will go up to possible 100, looking for break of the support line and impulsive move of 5/3 on one hour candle
4541 2018-05-10 16:33:08 I had a cat that got covered in oil It would have been cruel to leave it to harden. Sooty was a happy cat when cleaned. Stay cool Les.

4552 2018-05-10 16:31:53 i uh almost had an oil incident even though i'm very aware of the dangers of oil and water and my nerves are shot because of it
4553 2018-05-10 16:31:30 oleaginous Mike Pence ... has to look it up  

1. rich in, covered with, or producing oil; oily or greasy.

2. exaggeratedly and distastefully complimentary; obsequious.
"candidates made the usual oleaginous speeches in the debate"
4554 2018-05-10 16:31:27 According to President Putin’s aide Yuri Ushakov, Russian investment in  developing Iran’s oil and gas fields could reach more than $50 billion.
4555 2018-05-10 16:31:24 This morning I woke up to tim telling me he took my car to get the oil changed and that he got me my favorite drink and I love this man SO MUCH
4556 2018-05-10 16:31:23 likely the same thing happens in calgary, and red deer, and lethbridge, and lloyd, it is easy to scale up,, likely the same thing is happening all over canada honestly, could be big oil, russia, right wing politics, using new tools of social media to divide us,
4557 2018-05-10 16:31:22 Wonder how many in DC bought oil futures in advance of this. And it sure will be a wonderful windfall for Putin.
4558 2018-05-10 16:31:22 Oil money? Maybe.

4567 2018-05-10 16:30:14 Oil and gas prices on the rise, health insurance costs dramatically increasing, safety and health regulations rolled back, kleptocrats making money, pay to play lobbyism, Russians running the country...you really know how to run a democracy straight into the ground!
4568 2018-05-10 16:30:14 Bro how long is a damn oil change supposed to be? I been at the car shop for damn near two hours
4569 2018-05-10 16:29:58 Please add me to your list of blocked former fans. I haven’t seen this whole conversation but if you are against the oil sands as someone who is losing his house THIS WEEK due to silly protesters blocking a pipeline I welcome not hearing any more nonsense.
4570 2018-05-10 16:29:56 Technology will not replace oil. What technology will replace is some energy needs. Oil will be needed no matter what energy sources we use.
4571 2018-05-10 16:29:53 Buy me co natural’s Argan oil and I’m all happy

4580 2018-05-10 16:28:16 Idk if it was a coincidence or not that i got 2 nails in one tire & one in another but just glad it happened when i already had an appt to get my oil changed 
4581 2018-05-10 16:27:58 god i'm so fucking. sick. i did a face mask bc my skin has been feeling like a fucking oil pool and then im gonna shower and do art .. . . hwuh
4582 2018-05-10 16:27:56 Better check your numbers again. We went from the governor’s 1.2 billion ask to less than 500 million. Don’t worry about oil & gas, Governor has run a good bit of companies out of the state already.  No rescue coming there unless offshore GOM activity picks up substantially.
4583 2018-05-10 16:27:52 Many are trying our best.  Speaking out, donating money to campaigns we can’t afford to flip the Congress & thwart his power.  Prices on gas, oil, health care and many foods will soar this summer because of his decisions.  It should wake up his base.
4584 2018-05-10 16:27:38 I’ll try again......it was their money......it was held/frozen to make them come to a deal.....THEIR money from oil sales.
4585 2018-05-10 16:27:30 $CEI added off 52 week lows. Oil pennies in play $SDRL
4586 2018-05-10 16:27:28 Russia benefits, closer to home oil companies will benefit.  Now they can destabilize oil future and blame it all on Iran, not on Trump, and the ultra-rich in the US benefit from it as well. Gas prices here went up 25% due to the Trump Tax Law, and went up 10 cents more overnight
4587 2018-05-10 16:27:22 nowt a good war cant cure #OIL
4588 2018-05-10 16:27:20 If Canada is against exporting oil we should also be against importing it as well. Let’s see how that goes. #politicians #braindead #unbelievable
4589 2018-05-10 16:27:16 So, petrol in 
UK is Rs 108/liter
China Rs 80.16
France Rs 121.46
Germany Rs 114.27
is petrol more expensive in India?

UAE citizens get petrol for Rs 43.30 (and they are producers of oil)

4603 2018-05-10 16:26:24 Answer my question. Didn’t Trump claim he had a plan to destroy ISIS within 30 days of taking office? If so, how come ISIS is still around? Face it, Trump lies to your face and you are dumb enough to believe anything he says. He’s a snake oil salesman and you’re the perfect mark.

4606 2018-05-10 16:25:47 CBD oil is amazing for anxiety. The Holland and Barrett stuff though is only 2% CBD you can get higher concentrated oils on amazon etc up to 40% but from speaking to people who take it and make it its best to ease yourself in with something like the 2% stuff and work your way up!
4607 2018-05-10 16:25:46 If you eat or drink coconut oil I’ve noticed it makes them end faster and become lighter. You can melt a teaspoon & out it in your drink or you can cook with coconut oil.  It helps

4609 2018-05-10 16:25:36 So it was better when SAVAK was terrorizing Iranians while Pahlavi gave up Iran's oil to British Petroleum for pennies?

4629 2018-05-10 16:23:46 What y’all don’t realize is everytime trump tweets some stupid shit the price of oil goes up, therefore gas prices hike up making oil and gas companies BILLIONS of dollars whenever he tweets some sideways shit about foreign policy.  his business associates must love his tweets.
4630 2018-05-10 16:23:46 US biggest exporter of oil; currently. Who is the fool
4631 2018-05-10 16:23:37 Water, salt and hypoclorous acid. Water, white vinegar and lemon essential oil (from a reputable company) would work just as well.
4632 2018-05-10 16:23:34 The girl that sent me up to get my oil changed has perfectly manicured nails. I want to know what kind of sorcery she is practicing to keep those if she works on vehicles.
4633 2018-05-10 16:23:26 #ableg #abed #cdnpoli @cathmckenna @SPhillipsAB @jkenney   I think @KHayhoe said the world will run out of oil in 150 years.
4634 2018-05-10 16:23:24 Washed my car and got an oil change #adulting
4635 2018-05-10 16:23:16 i went to college to take chem and learn like dissolves like so i could use this knowledge to dissolve oil stains w/ dish soap
4636 2018-05-10 16:23:15 in 08 most people had better (& more full time) jobs on wages likely the same as today. Now rates & oil are ramping hard on lower global growth. How does this support consumer spend? Maybe this is why smart govn, bankers & some very rich are adding gold. The reset will be ugly.
4637 2018-05-10 16:23:09 my phone is always broken  this time I spilt coconut oil INSIDE the mf

4640 2018-05-10 16:22:59 Enjoy your raising oil costs.

Which will domino into rising consumer costs.
Which will cause them to buy less.
...

You see where this going?
Trump's economy is coming, probably by the end of this summer.
GOP's tax cuts didn't help at all.
4641 2018-05-10 16:22:49 I jus wish Sierra would find my coconut oil in her car 
4642 2018-05-10 16:22:27 Beyond my scope of knowledge. I know the USA exports oil to some countries while importing from others. Maybe trump even wants this crisis to justify more oil exploration & drilling on national lands & in our oceans.Who knows?
4643 2018-05-10 16:22:21 They returned Iran’s own money mostly held from shell oil deal(I said mostly) in return they had some access and control over a rogue player that created a safer atmosphere than there was or is now. Why is this so f..ing difficult for some people to understand.
4644 2018-05-10 16:22:18 PSA y'all: you can actually blame @realDonaldTrump for the uptick in gas prices. Pulling out of the Iran deal has decreased the supply of oil thereby increasing the price.
4645 2018-05-10 16:21:49 Abeg who dey sell fuel for filling station no be oil worker?
4646 2018-05-10 16:21:49 A woman will look like an oil painting on Twitter and someone will say omg what's your skin routine
4647 2018-05-10 16:21:39 They burn off 100 billion times more methane in the oil sands.  He is too much.  Why doesn't he stop flying around theglobe to avoid QP?  The natural extension of this is to turn off all our pilot lights in gas furnaces.
4648 2018-05-10 16:21:38 I wonder oooooooo 
How can someone sound that way
4649 2018-05-10 16:21:37 If a kid born in Dubai, he or she has an Oil subsidy because the Oil wealth belong to all citizens not only to one Corporation. If you see poor in Dubai, they are not Dubai citizens, they come other countries. The poor is hurting at the pumps, no one really care. my Opinion.
4650 2018-05-10 16:21:34 when I ask for a lil oil & vinegar on my sandwich they always hear what I be sayin but know what my heart be wanting when they drown my sandwich anyways
4651 2018-05-10 16:21:33 might to get a oil change before i hit the road
4652 2018-05-10 16:21:27 You're joking right? I could've sworn trump cut back on foreign aid to African countries. Especially the once that don't have large oil deposits.
4653 2018-05-10 16:21:22 Sorry to disagree but higher oil prices always asso.with inflation and allround growth and not recession
4654 2018-05-10 16:21:20 The USA will be the first exporter of oil in the world
4655 2018-05-10 16:21:15 Ramping up to infrastructure week.  Roads to national parks need to be upgraded to support 18 wheelers taking away oil, coal,  lumber.  Its not about increasing availability (cynical self thoughts)

4657 2018-05-10 16:21:07 Mr. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump , As you know and have fought for, WE HAVE ALL THE ENERGY/OIL we need for America to make up the difference from Iran AND Venezuela. WE NEED TO GET US PRODUCERS PUMPING. & we should work with Canada & even #Brazil & other allies to make up shortfalls.
4658 2018-05-10 16:20:37 Q: "@SecretaryZinke why has your administration taken these steps to limit the public process for oil and gas leasing?  Doesn't the public have the right to comment of the development on their #publiclands." @SenatorTomUdall Thank you!!
4659 2018-05-10 16:20:34 That’s right! There are argan trees. This is the beginning of Moroccan argan oil! 
4660 2018-05-10 16:20:31 My dad was like this: before he’d let me drive the Beetle, he made me demonstrate (and complete) changing the oil and adjusting the valves. I could do both.
4661 2018-05-10 16:20:23 I wonder If her mommy ever changed the oil on their car or plastered that wall......run, Harry run
4662 2018-05-10 16:20:22 #SAVP - Think this is offering very good value at current sp. Oil price doesn’t have a massive effect on netback per bbl but when you’re producing 22k boepd, the relative impact against £250m MCAP is increased. Niger activities have huge upside also. Expect another success soon.
4663 2018-05-10 16:20:19 You mean the human pastor that put oil on his head or God almighty. I don't support the guy calling him FAKE though, but sincerely I am disappointed in @ProfOsinbajo as the VP of the country. well surprises are bound to happen but not when politics is played with human life.
4664 2018-05-10 16:20:08 still getting free oil changes...
4665 2018-05-10 16:20:03 @DanRather Trump brags about world peace because he'll meet with Kim. When it was China that created the peace.  While Trump and his partner in crime Netanyaho in Israel are going out of their way to provoke, bully & bs Iran into a war so USA can steal the oil & Israel the land
4666 2018-05-10 16:19:56 You think Israel holds Golan because of oil? And Jacob Rothschild's equity in Genie is small. But you've read the conspiracy theories and parroted them as if true.

4668 2018-05-10 16:19:50 Because he along with outside actors in region have another agenda, boost in arm sales accessibility to an oil prize at the end or indeed during (Russia/Iran). Then to cap it lol off what a deselection from other current irritations to an administration that is stinking.

4671 2018-05-10 16:19:33 Idiot. It was working fine. It was on the brink of being adjusted. Our allies, along with the other parties to the agreement, continue to abide by it. You killed it because you hate everything Obama did (and you want to benefit your oil tycoon friends).
4672 2018-05-10 16:19:19 Health Care costs rising.

Wages NOT rising. 

Oil prices rising (and about to spike).

That 40-45% were always going to overlook scandals, but they do so at their own peril.
4673 2018-05-10 16:19:13 They eat the nuts of the argan tree. The goat-digest-nuts are processed into argan oil!
4674 2018-05-10 16:19:11 It concerns me as a vet that a lot of the GOP think oil and the military are intertwined with profits.

We are not mercenaries.  Stop pimping us out to big oil.
4675 2018-05-10 16:19:10 Went to get my oil changed and the dealership tried telling me I needed 4 new tires and I just got a new car...safe to say I let them know how I felt about that comment 
4676 2018-05-10 16:19:06 The most significant variable is world oil limited reserves and the fact that the US started burning its own tells you that oil rich countries MUST have nuclear warheads to survive the predator Jewmericans. And plan B already in process: massive brainwash to total idiocy.
4677 2018-05-10 16:19:05 Cleaner still, renewables.  Get off Oil.  We don’t need yet another pipeline.  Enough.  Employ people to clean up this mess and build sustainable energy.  Save the planet.  Over 15,000 scientists can’t be wrong.
4678 2018-05-10 16:19:02 This is a million times worse than oil spill

4682 2018-05-10 16:18:51 No more tax dollars to bail out big oil! Tax dollars invest in renewal clean green energy only.  There is no futures in fossil fuels. Save the planet.

4685 2018-05-10 16:18:34 I need an oil change but my car is such a mess I’m embarrassed to let anyone else in it 
4686 2018-05-10 16:18:29 @petenajarian and @jonnajarian were early and smart in energy but others who get on late fail to realize we have a new President. Prez Trump KNOWS WE HAVE ALL THE ENERGY WE NEED TO MAKE UP DIFFERENCE from Iran AND Venezuela. Expect US to pump more oil than ever. @TDAJJKinahan
4687 2018-05-10 16:18:25 Critiquing the Rolls-Royce Cullinan knowing damn well I probably couldn't even afford an oil change

4691 2018-05-10 16:17:47 Wow same lmao I use either straight up sunscreen or if you wanna get a little color but not get burned, try tanning oil/spray with SPF. That’s worked for me
4692 2018-05-10 16:17:28 It's been revealed our allies offered you what you wanted and you still left the deal- you violated an international agreement and appear to desire war. No doubt to raise oil $$$. SHAME
4693 2018-05-10 16:17:27 Russia says thanks for helping to raise price of oil
4694 2018-05-10 16:17:16 Gas is 3$ and an oil change cost 150$ 

I can’t afford to have a car at this point. 
4695 2018-05-10 16:17:12 It is annoying when you can't follow interesting people because of arbitrary twitter rules.
4696 2018-05-10 16:17:12 good point. Let me revise: ""we will work closely together to make sure oil never drops"
4697 2018-05-10 16:17:06 It somewhat worries me how if feels like they are blurring the lines between medical and recreational. From what i understood, QC wants to serve both while they never fucking did before. I take my oil/flower from @TweedInc #C45 #SenCA #SOCI

This deal for you had nothing to do with nuclear technology and everything todo with raising oil and gas prices for your fracking buddies
4709 2018-05-10 16:16:09 These filters are all plugged due to lack of maintenance -a plugged oil filter is sure to cause major engine damage. Is it really worth skipping an oil change?
4710 2018-05-10 16:16:03 @colbertlateshow Trump brags about world peace because he'll meet with  Kim, thanks to China. While going out of his way with his partner in crime Israel to provoke, bully & bs  their way into a war with Iran, so they can steal Iran's oil.

4739 2018-05-10 16:13:24 You're not too bright, because Conservatives discuss all the amendments, depending on their relevancy to the topic at hand. We discuss the 1st and 2nd more, because many on the left are attacking those two the most.
4740 2018-05-10 16:13:22 At least some of these banks are starting to realise the issues here, just why 6 months out?- oil at 65 and oil at 100 is quite binary - you either want to incentivise investment and destroy demand or you dont - so the switch always happen a lot quicker than people think #Oil
4741 2018-05-10 16:13:22 @MichaelSerapio Trump talks about world peace because he'll meet wih Kim thanks to China. Then goes out of his way,  with his partner in crime lsrael, to bs  provoke  & bully Iran into a war with USA so they can  steal the oil reserves.

4752 2018-05-10 16:12:27 But they're only thinking of jobs and the community!!! Think of the children!

4753 2018-05-10 16:12:16 But current McDonald's fries aren't even vegetarian! They still have some "beef flavoring" in there and they straight up lied and were like "Yeah, they're vegetarian bc we use veg oil plz ignore this beef we sprinkle on".

4772 2018-05-10 16:10:16 i’ve become obsessed with coconut oil since getting some yesterday, it’s confirmed
4773 2018-05-10 16:10:09 I wonder if it stems from him trying to kidnap Olive Oil from Popeye
4774 2018-05-10 16:10:08 知ってる？スーパーってタダで牛脂くれるんだよ。
4775 2018-05-10 16:10:05 Yea, he was a bad guy. But he didn't attack us and he didn't have wmd's. We lied and now we are stealing their oil and opium. There are these things called laws. Constitution and international. Both violated to pursue war with a country who didn't attack us. Why lie?
4776 2018-05-10 16:09:59 Too much oil.
4777 2018-05-10 16:09:31 ใครอ่ะ
4778 2018-05-10 16:09:25 Golan Heights are the oil and gas fields of Syria that Israel has stolen and won't return. Israel will fight the mother of all wars to keep the Golan Heights oil fields.
4779 2018-05-10 16:09:25 Why the ungrounded fear of nuclear power? Coal/oil are responsible for astronomically more deaths. Why do people care more about pollution that can be safely contained (nuclear) than fossil fuel emissions?
4780 2018-05-10 16:09:19 "The company [...] said the ban on unconventional oil and gas extraction would result in the country missing out on economic benefits, including about 3100 jobs and £1 billion for local communities."

4782 2018-05-10 16:09:06 I watched an old black woman grease her chicken with MOTOR OIL. I lost all hope for humanity after seeing that.
4783 2018-05-10 16:09:05 We gotta taste it first!!! It could taste like oil and apple cider vinegar 
4784 2018-05-10 16:09:02 There’s no way in hell i should be up here waiting on a oil change for two fucking hours bro 
4785 2018-05-10 16:08:55 Can somebody come take my car. Wash it , vacuum it , and rake it to get an oil change and you can use my car all day. I’m paying for everything.
4786 2018-05-10 16:08:51 Iranians forbidding any of their oil from going to the US starting right now with no warning will cause total chaos here, gas markets will violently react and prices at the pump will cause real heartache.
4787 2018-05-10 16:08:49 how do you make the oil, JP?
4788 2018-05-10 16:08:41 And Scotland owns 96% of these oil reserves! Away & steal somebody elses stuff.
4789 2018-05-10 16:08:32 Is it me or coconut oil is actually very drying or am I just buying fake ones??

4793 2018-05-10 16:08:15 Vlad needs higher oil prices to survive.
4794 2018-05-10 16:08:13 If there’s ever another oil crisis they can solve it by harvesting the oil off my forehead.
4795 2018-05-10 16:08:12 Mineral oil is harmful for your body!!! Esp pregg women with little babies in ur belly!! Stop with bio oil. 
4796 2018-05-10 16:08:07 No of course not, but when oil was$140 a barrel it was the time to invest.... it was unrealistic to think those levels would stay there for ever.
4797 2018-05-10 16:08:06 おまかせメニューェ…
4798 2018-05-10 16:07:49 Ridiculous. Which of Obama’s policies caused the US’ current economy? Over-regulation? Tax hikes? Fostering long term trade deficits? Cultivating enemies like North Korea and ISIS? Burying industries like coal and oil in red tape? Bailing out the banks and automakers?
4799 2018-05-10 16:07:42 It's the Trump admin itself saying that if we stop buying Iranian oil in 90 days that we'll have dangerous problems in out markets. That's why oil sanctions get delayed for 180 days, carpets and fruit get 90 days.
4800 2018-05-10 16:07:33 But you'd have to remind him to get it, or else he'd think you wouldn't have to change it like his oil.

4805 2018-05-10 16:06:44 So why do we support head chopping saudi arabia? Why did we build al-qaeda and isis? Why do we fund them? We don't care about terrorists or their victims. We kill and imprison our own and have dirty water across the country. We care about oil and other mineral wealth.

4809 2018-05-10 16:06:26 Ur type of leader was in power for 6 solid years and sold oil for as much as $150 per barrel but did nothing amd depleted our treasury. Is that the type we need? The type that ruined our economy with ease. You know not what u need oga
4810 2018-05-10 16:06:16 The value of vegetables and fruits traded in exports has finally surpassed  the value of crude oil traded in global market. This means Uganda is not focusing on the real oil.
4811 2018-05-10 16:06:16 Went to get lavender oil and bought frankincense too. Apparently it’s good for stress, I’m not stressed but bought it just in case. No idea if it works because I’ve put it on when I’m not stressed just to try it out doh but what I do know is I now smell like a musty old church 
4812 2018-05-10 16:06:15 The correct answer is millions of dollars are being funnelled into a campaign to kill the electric car. Oil companies, dealerships and legacy automakers have a lot to lose if EVs take off

4817 2018-05-10 16:05:52 Dude I swear to you like two little drops fell in the oil and that shit burst into flames and I was home alone & had no idea how to put it out.
4818 2018-05-10 16:05:49 Yes, I can see that! After all, we know that our governments have somehow 'lost' all the extra taxes they got when the baby-boom became a paying tax boom AND also the vast grillions from oil & gas AND all the spending taxes that even pensioners suffer. Must all be our fault!
4819 2018-05-10 16:05:48 Thanks for letting us know what's on your mind. If trans fats are a concern, you'll be glad to know that fully hydrogenated oils we use do not contain trans fat. Trans fats are caused when oil is partially hydrogenated.
4820 2018-05-10 16:05:43 New heart, change of oil.
4821 2018-05-10 16:05:40 @TeamCavuto remember it goes up as soon as something might happen but takes weeks to come down when it’s a false alarm. We have oil sitting at the drilling sites that cannot get refineries. On top of that the refineries are switching to summer blend and going down for maintenance
4822 2018-05-10 16:05:34 The big winners will be oil producers, like oh, say, Saudi Arabia and Russia. Just a coincidence, I am sure. Safer, I doubt. Israel and Iran started firing missiles at each other yesterday. Any Syrians left in Syria should get out now.

4828 2018-05-10 16:05:09 What hypocrisy! Trump and the wealthy don’t care about the Iranian people. They only care about regime change to steal billions from Iranian oil reserves. During the 1950’s, the CIA instigated regime change by killing a democratically elected Iranian leader.

4867 2018-05-10 16:01:49 So what is your plan for getting Iran to give up development of nuclear weapons. The price of oil is increasing sharply and that means more money for Iran oil exports. Oil money increase means resources for their nuclear program.

4926 2018-05-10 15:56:30 Diesel prices so far in May average 127.08p a litre - that's the highest they've been since December 2014 & they look set to rise further! #Fuel #Oil #Markets
4927 2018-05-10 15:56:20 Here’s what I’m seeing: oil prices are rising, prices at the fuel pump are going to go up just at the same time many consumers have bought SUVs, & other bigger, less-fuel-efficient vehicles.  That will pinch wallets & raise prices across the economy.
4928 2018-05-10 15:56:15 Actually,if you check,the US doesn't import much oil from the Middle East,& we produce more oil than than they do. I suppose trump wants to own ALL oil & stockpile,though,to advance his goal of American Imperialism!
4929 2018-05-10 15:56:11 I be having to watch myself after a fresh oil change. Like ok bitch slow it down, just cruising

4946 2018-05-10 15:53:33 How can we have any control over the price of imported oil ? Giving relief to certain vulnerable sections of the population is another matter. Private car owners cannot have it both ways!

4949 2018-05-10 15:53:04 Thank you for your service and for the insights you have! I would like to open that up further though (playing devil’s advocate) and say that if the military is killing for oil, why is abortion (I suppose considered a mercy kill?) much worse?
4950 2018-05-10 15:53:02 Other Permians addressed to varying degrees, stocks not flat on the 6 month, these guys recovered off lows on the same move that's taken others to 52 week highs, these guus off 4Q completion delays. JAG basis hedges on 60% of 2018 E oil volumes.

4953 2018-05-10 15:52:48 Not telling you about TRUMPS idiotic move pulling out of the IND this week only because it was a Campaign Promise. Hey Paul tell them much of this will change and just today Oil/Gas up and will cost Consumers 38 million! There goes your pay.
4954 2018-05-10 15:52:46 I need to get an oil change but that guy that literally came to my work will be there and I’m so uncomfortable

4964 2018-05-10 15:52:02 Imagine how much better off we’d be as a society if the fitness industry was as big as oil.
4965 2018-05-10 15:52:01 The economy has holes that are growing by the day. Oil and gas prices (especially now with you pulling out of Iran), food prices, insurance rates. How about the National Debt after you stole all that tax money from workers? Leave the press alone. You're a little wannabe dictator.
4966 2018-05-10 15:51:55 Do you have children? Do you think about what kind of world they will get? Fighting over water, oil, left with decimation, rising sea levels, more intense and more frequent storms.

4984 2018-05-10 15:50:48 I'm sure there will b a lot of fracking for oil to further aggrevate the already Critical water shortage . Read that a large piece of Navajo Nations land in Arizona is leased by the U.S for Uranium mining .
4985 2018-05-10 15:50:45 Of course, it's a basic principle of any insurance. 
You're asked a zip code to apply with hc insurance co. This isn't about whether you live next to a oil refinery but population size. Less populated, higher premiums. Unfair.
4986 2018-05-10 15:50:43 Yeah, US does not buy much from Iran. However, like it or not oil prices wotldwide are affected by this. I am with Trump on Iran deal. However, this is a natural consequences of this decision.

4995 2018-05-10 15:50:23 Great summary! But Trump + France and Brits benefit from it too. In fact Trump is increasing oil production and will surpass Russian soon. Seems like "economic preparation" for american production increase.
4996 2018-05-10 15:50:22 "Costa Rica’s push towards clean energy faces no large-scale backlash, in part because the country has no significant oil or gas industry." No Big Oil or Koch network to undermine the science and corrupt the political process, in other words.

5048 2018-05-10 15:45:14 I need an oil change
5049 2018-05-10 15:45:08 Yup. I use that. Can’t really use too much peppermint cuz it irritates it more. The problem is the areas I can’t reach cuz of the style. I’ll probably destroy it trying to get the oil in there lol
5050 2018-05-10 15:45:01 Sounds like you could advertise a Grape Seed Oil that would work wonders!  You already wear the result quite well  #BusinessMogulModel #TheInternational
5051 2018-05-10 15:44:58 Trudeau is killing our major income source with two faced actions killing the oil industry. That is going to be a huge loss to our economy when we were in a position for international sales.

5056 2018-05-10 15:44:43 How many military and oil stocks are in YOUR portfolio? Don't hold your breath for that VP slot when Trump is removed, you are complicit in the RNC emails. How much did Russia spend on your loyalty?

5061 2018-05-10 15:44:06 @lazarusnaturals I was eager to try your CBD oil and ordered it on Sat., 05/05/18. I paid extra for 3 day shipping. It wasn't honored, I won't be receiving my order until Fri., 05/11/18, and I still haven't received a response to my email about my order. Last time for me!
5062 2018-05-10 15:44:01 Jessy left me her car to get an oil change while she’s in Huston but little does she know I’m driving her car everywhere while she’s gone
5063 2018-05-10 15:44:00 They bought us, and saved us from administration about 5 months before! Clearly one of the FSG our crew so there’s no point discussing. You expect oil money, they never promised that and we are in a much better place than when they took over. Slow and steady

5072 2018-05-10 15:43:00 Sorry snowflake, "earth-worshiping" foolish zealots but pipelines are needed. You can stop using oil if you want though! Worship the Lord and not the earth, fools!
5073 2018-05-10 15:42:57 not true opec who controls the prices has put oil at it's highest this was started way before the ending of the Iran deal

5075 2018-05-10 15:42:46 We got screwed on oil. I had dozens of stories to choose from, Maclean's was first. I grew up when you didn't wear helmets to ride your bike, no sun screen, you knew your neighbors who watched out for your kids. Times changed, so has environmental Canada, not always for the good.

5080 2018-05-10 15:42:24 But the 5 hostages in Iran will get more beatings.  The deal had to be recertifed every 90 days, so he could've waited.  This is really about Iran trading oil in Euros instead of Dollars.  Iran announced it last month.

5090 2018-05-10 15:41:21 Dumb, read on the issue before making emotional, vague comments. Price of oil, please!  vs peace in the Middle East.  Kind of goes against your Russian narrative, since this now puts the US squarely with Israel - against Russia.  Let's see how much dirty they have on Trump.
5091 2018-05-10 15:41:14 Praise God for oil and that the Lord told MAN in Genesis "to take dominion" over the earth. The true triune God is to be worshiped not the earth. If Native Americans want to go back to "tipi and horse living" and forsake their pickups, feel free! Genesis 12:3 and Psalm 105:15.
5092 2018-05-10 15:41:14 Not to mention that China now has ton of oil storage that didn't even exist before. That said, how do we quantify a "new normal" level of storage
5093 2018-05-10 15:41:00 A great day for the only true Americans. Especially now when there will be a demand for oil thanks to trump pulling out of Iranian deal.middle east has cut production down making it cost more for oil and gas

As well far I know Russia has ethnic and territory issue at Caucasus too.

Those region have abundant resources, thus, Russia aim to gain such a rich resources like oil.

I hope war end

5109 2018-05-10 15:39:57 And smartness too! In one side its royal leaders “sheikhs” camped with bin Laden to hunt in Helmand in 1999 while it was a crucial supplier of oil & gas to the west in the other side!

5112 2018-05-10 15:39:46 I say let’s link the CBC’s budget  to the $40 billion  a year trade surplus created by “subsidized” oil & gas. If that latter goes up, so does the former. I imagine that’s how they do it in Norway.

5125 2018-05-10 15:39:08 Oil prices are mainly driven by opec, with Iran being sanctioned they will go up further. Carbon taxes have been proven to drive thinking in the right direction towards sustainability. Look at EV sales, going through the roof.
5126 2018-05-10 15:39:07 not true it's because opec has raised the price of oil

5134 2018-05-10 15:38:10 låg operationell risk = mkt höga marginaler. Norilsk Nickel har bruttomarginal på ca 45% medan Boliden har 19%. Samma sak med Lukoil jämfört med ex.vis am Big oil companies ,Exxon ex.vis. Marginalerna går ej att jämföra pga bättre kvalitet på råvara samt lägre lönenivåer

5146 2018-05-10 15:36:59 It's surprising that Iran hasn't simply cut us off from their oil catastrophically already, but given that they have 180 days before we cut ourselves off, they may figure they can wait and hope for Trump to be removed.

5152 2018-05-10 15:36:24 I responded to YOUR tweet stating there was more oil in ANWR than in Russia. That is not true.  Yes, US TOTAL oil reserves is larger than Russia's, but ANWR only accounts for no more than 16 Billion barrels of our estimated 264 billion total.
5153 2018-05-10 15:36:20 The call to #restructureNGR is yet to be understood by many Nigerians. Same to say that the problems of Nigeria is unknown to many. #restructuringNGR will yeild that regions and states will firmly diversify, bringing our the vast riches of Nigeria beyond crude oil

5158 2018-05-10 15:35:52 Oil holding steady for today...no reactions..
5159 2018-05-10 15:35:42 We have re-vitalised the energy sector. The GORTT, led by the PM, has led significant discussions with upstream and downstream companies, both locally and abroad. The Min of Fin has also revised the oil and gas taxation regime.
5160 2018-05-10 15:35:42 Lived in western ks for 6+ years. Sad reality of ethanol boom is using more water for corn than other crops. Corn is a thirsty crop. IMO-Water will be more precious there than oil there soon.
5161 2018-05-10 15:35:39 Like I've said.. Follow the oil. 
But it IS a religious issue too. But whatever. Have a nice day
5162 2018-05-10 15:35:34 Interior Sec. Zinke was asked at Senate hearing today if Florida still off table for drilling.

"Yes," he replied. "I'm committed to ... no new oil and gas platforms off the coast of Florida. They are still in the process legally, but I'm committed to that."

5177 2018-05-10 15:33:40 Reimposition sanctions on Iran will likely have consequences that go against the stated objectives of the Trump administration. Any short-term spike in the oil price in response to the curtailment of Iranian imports is likely to provide higher revenues to actors like Russia.

5199 2018-05-10 15:32:17 Reimposition sanctions on Iran will likely have consequences that go against the stated objectives of the Trump administration. Any short-term spike in the oil price in response to the curtailment of Iranian imports is likely to provide higher revenues to actors like Russia.
5200 2018-05-10 15:32:15 The state that gave us polluting @EPAScottPruitt & melting snowball Senator @JimInhofe and erected oil derrick next to state capitol. I know 3 young people who fled #Oklahoma as soon as they could.

5207 2018-05-10 15:31:34 been wondering for a while what made-up reason the west had for attacking Iran, my first guess of oil was (shockingly) correct

5210 2018-05-10 15:31:26 Also oil prices increased from pulling out of the nuclear deal and reinstating sanctions on Iran.

5221 2018-05-10 15:30:57 Pretty sure he is pulling out of Iran deal to destabilize the middle east even more, driving up oil prices and creating opportunity for Russia to become supplier. The whole treasonous bunch want oil contracts. It's all about $$$$

5223 2018-05-10 15:30:46 That's what I don't like in Israel. Even when they say you own land. You don't really own it. example: if I find oil under my house, the goverment takes it and leaves you with no profit. They would give you a new house if that's the case but that's it. But no country is perfect.

5240 2018-05-10 15:29:30 Despite being an OPEC member and Africa’s biggest oil producer, #Nigeria imports nearly all its fuel because of the decrepit state of its refineries. It caps the gasoline price at 145 naira per liter ($0.48 at the official rate), which analysts say is below market costs.
5241 2018-05-10 15:29:27 Tourism in the Okanagan is sustained by Albertans. They afford to stay in the Okanagan because of their oil jobs.

5243 2018-05-10 15:29:05 When I used protein powders regularly (about 5-6 years ago), I really liked vanilla powder with coconut water before a workout and chocolate with a non-dairy milk (usually almond at that time) plus 1 T flax seed oil after. Both were pretty tasty. Best cold.

5276 2018-05-10 15:25:46 Yes, but the impact really depends on where you source your barrels. US can subsititue Canadian heavy oil for Venezuelan, others may not be as fortunate. We'll probably see a shift in trade, while global API averages will shift minimally - a couple percentage points or less.
5277 2018-05-10 15:25:43 I was just reading this like a minute ago. He is no "analyst". The fund he works in needs oil to go higher, so he'll pull any scary number out of his ass to scare the dumb dumbs in the oil market. Besides, most "analysts" have gotten the oil market wrong.
5278 2018-05-10 15:25:36 Gas prices have jumped more than $1 a gal since Trump took office (more than $1.50 higher than Obama’s lowest).

5303 2018-05-10 15:23:01 The biggest blunder will be US withdrawing from the Iran Deal which may cause a crisis in the Middle East soaring oil prices. US is isolating from the world might trigger a economic downhill for us which is not wise move.
5304 2018-05-10 15:22:59 He is a hypocrite and it shows he only cares about the oil hence a few weeks ago he said bush did iraq wrong that bush should of stole the oil so trump tore up the Iran nuclear deal so he can steal the oil
5305 2018-05-10 15:22:55 Trump was really multitasking on this one.

--Revenge on Obama for mocking him in 2011? Check

--Accomplishes another important Russian foreign policy objective upping oil prices and fracturing NATO? Check

--War President! Strong! Check
5306 2018-05-10 15:22:45 Sickening. CNN reported what a historic moment that Trump met the North Korean ex prisoners. Normalizing him to sell news time. Economy strong, stock market rising again, oil high, low unemployment could allow Trump and GOP STAY in power. Morons vote with their bank accounts.
5307 2018-05-10 15:22:43 Apparently the attock oil refinery's oil pipeline bursted near DHA and that effected the traffic in the entire city.
5308 2018-05-10 15:22:39 You can accomplish same with less oil if, on last step, you transfer to hot cast iron, and bake in oven on 400 for 10 to 15 min.

Also means you can finish meat prep while it bakes.
5309 2018-05-10 15:22:32 How about you release some oil reserves to take the pressure off the working class?

5314 2018-05-10 15:22:09 Oil has moved sharply lower and this underpinning USDCAD..
5315 2018-05-10 15:22:05 Oil has moved sharply lower and this underpinning USDCAD..
5316 2018-05-10 15:22:04 Driven by waste veggie oil too
5317 2018-05-10 15:21:58 Ive been suffering from allergies my whole life. Pharmaceuticals will give you short term solution and more problems long term. Tarragon Oil is the best long term solution. Two drops 3 times a day then bring it down to once a day. I promise it gets rid off all the allergies 
5318 2018-05-10 15:21:58 Mas agora é sobre a questão do oil e da Petrobras :)
5319 2018-05-10 15:21:56 Practicing torture is just one of the obvious next steps. Don’t be surprised if the US ends up being “invited” to “secure” some Middle East oil fields - indefinitely - either. We’re in dark times.
5320 2018-05-10 15:21:56 The "useless" Buhari Govt appears to be doing more for Nigeria in the area of Infrastructure, in 3 years, compared to 16yrs of PDP rule.

What's ironic is that many of these projects were abandoned in the past because no funds despite oil prices being high.
5321 2018-05-10 15:21:56 Omg and the other one was that I was in a weird inside forest and there were weed spots like little bodegas but of weed. YO they figured out how to make cauliflower into weed, there were frying big chunks of it in cbd oil n turning it into fire weed. Tf wrong w me?
5322 2018-05-10 15:21:48 I countered this point directly in the prior comment. The number was off on a budet totality of ~1%(300 million) because of Trump tax increase. Every year one should expect this type of variability when we are so dependent upon oil prices.
5323 2018-05-10 15:21:44 ど、ドラマーさんやーーー！！

(ドラムとか絶対出来ない手足一緒になる)
5324 2018-05-10 15:21:37 “Jordan I’m not an idiot I know how to check my oil. I don’t know where to put the oil, but I know how to check it” 

.......oh alright Kooper
5325 2018-05-10 15:21:34 They don't have the money  NOW, because oil is still relatively cheap.  When oil was around $103/barrel they had PLENTY of money.  You do realize Russia has more oil than Saudi Arabia don't you?  They are second behind the US in reserves.
5326 2018-05-10 15:21:27 oil
5327 2018-05-10 15:21:17 Oil Price is beyond that all
5328 2018-05-10 15:21:13 vitaしかないのでPSP購入検討します……
5329 2018-05-10 15:21:04 Uh, did I say anywhere antisemitism was a myth?

Did I say Iranians were bathed with holy oil?

I called you out for doing the same thing what antisemitics do - dehumanize people.

How is your casual remark that Palestinians are not humans any different from antisemitic slurs?
5330 2018-05-10 15:20:57 Oil prices down $.20 a barrel! Olde moonbeam says this has to stop! We need money for illegals in California! Not a dime for the middle class! In fact taxes on the freeloading middle class need to go higher! 
5331 2018-05-10 15:20:43 サラちゃんきゅうさいと杏ちゃん17歳が個人的にびっくりしました
5332 2018-05-10 15:20:23 N.Korea is the Korean peninsular agenda ,South Korea and China have equally played a role  to which Trump takes all the credit .To help Putin you ended the deal so Russia 's oil will sell to help their sinking economy BRAVO whilst fueling war betn Israel and Iran .Putin controls
5333 2018-05-10 15:20:21 I prefer when a pastor teaches me the raw word and shows me revelations from the bible than carry oil and start baptising my head
5334 2018-05-10 15:20:14 Long oil 71
5335 2018-05-10 15:20:11 dala ka ng oil bb HAHAHAHA;-)
5336 2018-05-10 15:20:04 Trump talked all through his candidacy of seizing Middle East oil. An agreement wouldn't achieve that.
5337 2018-05-10 15:20:03 Not anymore. Im #800.
#MAGA
5338 2018-05-10 15:20:00 Yeah, why does Israel think the Oil in the GH is theirs? Genie Oil?
5339 2018-05-10 15:20:00 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.

5341 2018-05-10 15:19:57 Just saw that @OPISBiofuels is reporting - Ethanol's Discount to Gasoline Hits Widest Gap in Nearly Four Years. Yes, oil really needs more financial incentive here! People still believe they will blend w/o RFS?
5342 2018-05-10 15:19:55 Oil on canvas even 
5343 2018-05-10 15:19:54 Stop using palm oil before these beautiful creatures are gone.
5344 2018-05-10 15:19:50 Keep an eye on oil which is already holding earlier gains as a dip in the USD may see oil rise further.. This could keep a cap on USDCAD
5345 2018-05-10 15:19:46 Ms Arden. Pls apologize to the hard working and laid off families involved in Alberta’s Oil industry.
5346 2018-05-10 15:19:45 Most don’t when post media portrays themselves as wholly Cdn. I got suspicious some time ago when seeing lots of pro oil, anti-environment, pro Corp, Corp taxes never being low enough, anti-union (workers) “reporting”. Y’know? All those things that make their owners profits.
5347 2018-05-10 15:19:44 Keep an eye on oil which is already holding earlier gains as a dip in the USD may see oil rise further.. This could keep a cap on USDCAD
5348 2018-05-10 15:19:44 Is "Alberta Oil" also a well known anti-oil magazine ?
5349 2018-05-10 15:19:42 So when is US shell oil getting on ground to break OPEC or it has also joined them?
5350 2018-05-10 15:19:25 Even when i realized solar is finally viable the oil companies now have to make up this shit.
5351 2018-05-10 15:19:15 and all that because of higher interest rates, higher oil, higher dollar, EM turmoil, Middle East turmoil........
5352 2018-05-10 15:19:14 น่ารักม๊ากกกก

5357 2018-05-10 15:18:54 USDCAD is suffering from firmer oil and a weaker USD after the data and has taken out the previous lows at 1.2750 which on the charts suggests a potential to 1.2525 area..

5360 2018-05-10 15:18:44 It's like the countries within range of Iranian nuclear weapons don't want Iran to have nuclear weapons or something, while the European countries making money hand over fist from their oil have no problems with the regime's violent tendencies to their neighbors.  Strange. /sarc

5362 2018-05-10 15:18:21 Für mich entwickelte sich die USA unter Trump zu einem Schurken Staat weil er andere erpresst. Nur weil US Firmen nicht so gut Geschäft mit dem Iran machen. Wo bei die USA am liebsten die Oil Felder haben wollen wenn sie die bekommen hätten wäre der Rest egal
5363 2018-05-10 15:18:19 Use healthy fats, avocado, coconut oil, MCT oli, butter, ghee, lard. Canola, vegetable, and fake olive oil (man made)is killing people! It says no trans fat, but as soon as you heat it’s all trans! People were healthy when they consumed natural fats. 1 in 42 now 1 in 7 get cancer
5364 2018-05-10 15:18:10 Imbert: oil and gas price assumptions and other assumptions made in the 2017-2018 budget should remain as is for the time being.

5368 2018-05-10 15:17:44 So what is Valvoline gonna try and sell me today? Just give me my oil change that I asked for.
5369 2018-05-10 15:17:39 Use a natural lip scrub at least once every week to remove dead cells and dry skin from your lips. You can mix olive oil and sugar and use this for exfoliation. Once you rinse off, apply healing lip butter or your favorite lip moisturizer.
5370 2018-05-10 15:17:24 I really did a 10 minute ghetto oil change yesterday
5371 2018-05-10 15:17:22 The boys changing my oil BOTH called me darlin and sweetheart so I will be changing my status on fb to “it’s complicated”
5372 2018-05-10 15:17:19 If I were you Mr. Scheer I would leave the lesser issues for another day. Right now AB,  SK, are in desperate need of your full attention, regarding oil pipelines. We think your priorities are in the wrong place, and please do not talk about the Paris Climate Accord any further.
5373 2018-05-10 15:17:13 i’m still so confused by this??? the only seasoning a steak needs is salt. (pepper goes on after so cooking process doesn’t burn the pepper) ... get a cast iron skillet screaming hot with grape seed oil (high smoking point - perfect for high temp cooking) (1/2)
5374 2018-05-10 15:17:05 Ok.  Looks like a little "fake math" going on here.  Russia has around 256 Billion barrels of oil reserves.  ANWR is estimated to hold between 10.4 to 16 Billion barrels.  I guess you're using Trump math.
5375 2018-05-10 15:17:04 Before oil, Nigeria was a rich country.

Fact!!!
5376 2018-05-10 15:16:58 I got 3 breakfast tacos before I came to get an oil change and this woman keeps looking at me every time I pull a taco out of my purse like I am the second coming of Jesus
5377 2018-05-10 15:16:56 This one will either be storage for craft stuff or I might make some lemon curd! PB is the best toast topper though and Pics especially because no sugar and no palm oil! We  Pic's (especially with Marmite )
5378 2018-05-10 15:16:56 You know you cAn brush your teeth w oregano oil and get double the benefits.
5379 2018-05-10 15:16:54 and considering that Libya has vast resources esp oil, foreign states simply can't take their eyes off Libya. modern international relations. Oil = power
5380 2018-05-10 15:16:52 ชอบๆ
5381 2018-05-10 15:16:42 A big thanks to @aocs for a memorable experience at #AOCS2018! We were pleased to present the findings of our fish oil oxidation study and network with the industry's best and brightest. See you next year!
5382 2018-05-10 15:16:40 So what, there’s money to be made in higher oil prices!
5383 2018-05-10 15:16:37 I've had a great day with me mum:) got some oil paints and other art tackle plus some new threads and went to the cafe for lunch. Real nice day I hope yours is too
5384 2018-05-10 15:16:36 My baby oil after the shower routine is starting to get out of control. I just tried to cross my legs and it slid right off each other.

5386 2018-05-10 15:16:31 $100 oil a certainty on Mid east conflict as both Russia and Saudis need it.

5389 2018-05-10 15:16:06 1 BILLION PERCENT. If they have a problem with it they should do something. I’d love some free oil.
5390 2018-05-10 15:16:06 サラちゃんきゅうさいなんですか
5391 2018-05-10 15:16:04 I just paid $3.55 a gallon for gas yesterday.  How has the fast rising prices of gas gone under the radar?  Trump says we are not reliant on foreign oil anymore, so why are we paying such high prices for our own gas?  I know the answer, DJT lied to us again.  $4 is on the way
5392 2018-05-10 15:16:01 Or African Argan oil one its yellow in a red container
5393 2018-05-10 15:15:59 Those whom the Gods wish to destroy first makes mad? 1.1 million active fracked wells in US with no ill effects whatsoever What would make you wake UP? Cut off coal oil and gas when its minus 20C in mid winter & when you begin freezing to death fracking might seem a good idea!!
5394 2018-05-10 15:15:56 i never realized i had an ethnicity until i moved to the west coast and my housemates mocked me for cooking every meal in a pan with olive oil and garlic
5395 2018-05-10 15:15:53 น่าเบื่ออ่ะ
5396 2018-05-10 15:15:53 But not nearly enough to compensate for the demand.   And where will we get Materials to make.  things like plastic, tires, roads, plus all the things oil derivatives provide. Keep dreaming.

5400 2018-05-10 15:15:12 John Rose, City of Edmonton: Rise in oil prices good for Alta., but limited benefit as production already outstripping capacity to ship to market (due to pipeline opposition, etc.). #EREF2018

5402 2018-05-10 15:15:06 Minister of Finance Colm Imbert issues cautionary note on rising oil prices, saying it does dot necessarily translate to improvement in the economy, citing Petrotrin's not serving its debts. @Newsday_TT
5403 2018-05-10 15:14:47 I had to take my car to the shop for an oil change. When they finish, they better not tell me no bs
5404 2018-05-10 15:14:45 Do something nice for your car today. Get that oil change you have been putting off! @oreillyauto
5405 2018-05-10 15:14:35 The year is 2032. Identity politics are the new religions. Alternatives to oil are cheap and plentiful but oil still dominates tenfold. Wars are now started over YouTube personalities.

If it can then governments should be forcing through legislation to force your technology to be retrofitted now.
Long term diesel's dead,
if you can't except that you deluded.

5413 2018-05-10 15:13:58 Trumps breaking deal with Iran is ALL about oil. Now that we no longer are accepting oil in exchange for Iran deal, WATCH THE PRICES
5414 2018-05-10 15:13:55 you know  what Trump reminds me of a snake oil salesman
5415 2018-05-10 15:13:45 Why his glasses look like penzoil high mileage vehicle motor oil with active cleansing agents.
5416 2018-05-10 15:13:35 Trump could have negotiated for a better deal. Iran WAS compliant w DEAL. Instead he pulled out w NO PLAN except a WAR that Bolton,Bibi, Russia want. Bibi already sticking. Saw this coming. Oil companies love this too. Right Teddy.  You’re not fooling America
5417 2018-05-10 15:13:34 ซากุระเต็มทวิตเลยเด้อ
5418 2018-05-10 15:13:33 That’s all I got on in my profile pic  & if I’m being fancy I put a lil tea tree oil on my cheek bones for a natural highlight !
5419 2018-05-10 15:13:25 FakeFoxNews...you’ve been done by the biggest snake oil salesmen since the beginning of time...ie Trump University Trump Steaks Trump Airlines etc etc multiple screw jobs and bankruptcies and payoffs...what does it take for u 2 stop drinking the koolaide
5420 2018-05-10 15:13:17 Actually yes Asia does want the oil. That’s the point of the “expansion” of an already existing pipeline. Also, every refinery in Alberta can process dilbit. We also get more per barrel selling dilbit to Asian. We take a steep discount selling dilbit to the USA.
5421 2018-05-10 15:13:12 Trump: "Iran sanctions will start in 90 days, execept for buying their oil, because if we lost that suddenly it'd be really chaotic"

So what's to stop Iran from not selling us oil starting tomorrow? Can we even complain if they do?
5422 2018-05-10 15:13:09 Reimposition sanctions on Iran will likely have consequences that go against the stated objectives of the Trump administration. Any short-term spike in the oil price in response to the curtailment of Iranian imports is likely to provide higher revenues to actors like Russia.
5423 2018-05-10 15:13:02 YES! That’s exactly it.
5424 2018-05-10 15:12:53 No oil left we where told #ToryLiars
5425 2018-05-10 15:12:47 IF OIL GOES UP OUR ECONOMY WILL DIE AGAIN....THAT'S WHAT CAUSED THE TIPPING POINT  INTO THE LAST RECESSION..... IMO
5426 2018-05-10 15:12:40 The biggest subsidy of coal, oil and gas is a carbon price of zero in most markets.
5427 2018-05-10 15:12:30 It can. It is also what the $1.6 billion IMF standby facility is for. 
I don't see oil passing $75 per barrel, by the way.
5428 2018-05-10 15:12:27 Also maximizing oil revenue, which funds lots of Russia’s corruption.
5429 2018-05-10 15:12:19 Jienjoy kabisa hiyo per diem in tamu sana. Don't forget to sample the best things the per diem can buy...by the way the persecution of Kenyan women who work in Saudi Arabia is in your agenda right? Ama ni oil tu?
5430 2018-05-10 15:12:06 China bought their way into the WTO. Yep you guessed it. The same family that sold our uranium to Russia.....  Trump should take them out of it before they invade the Middle East for oil.
5431 2018-05-10 15:11:58 A return to $100 a barrel oil could be on the cards, say Bank of America analysts, as a collapse in Venezuelan output and a fall in Iran’s crude exports as a result of new US sanctions coincide with Opec and Russia-led supply curbs.

Iran has oil, toil, talent and godsend Putin, Xi, Macron & Merkel,
Will America stand isolate
Will Israel become desolate
5434 2018-05-10 15:11:42 You created this scenario for not calling out how stupid 45's move was in pulling out of Agreement.  You want war?? you are retiring, go fight, Me and my children won't for oil anymore. F##CK you and yours. GOP will be history in November.
5435 2018-05-10 15:11:41 @POTUS Yo Mr. Pres, we keep hearing about how we're now exporting oil & how much oil is available, yet the price at the pump just keeps going up & up & up!!! What gives? Supply & demand, well if the supply is great, why isn't the price dropping? MAGA. Trump 2020

*Fast-forward to moving embassy to Jerusalem, withdrawing from Iran nuclear deal.
5442 2018-05-10 15:11:10 I don’t know how, but my cars burning oil.  not sure what to do.
5443 2018-05-10 15:11:04 The answer is always the same, crush your enemy through the economy. Push oil production in America up 20% , Iran & Russia will be crushed
5444 2018-05-10 15:10:44 Very hard to avoid. MOST soaps now contain sodium palmitate which though can be sourced from animal products is cheapest from palm oil. VERY hard to avoid it. They need to more strictly enforce the sustainable mark
5445 2018-05-10 15:10:30 It’s so basic lol. I wash my face with dial soap and then after I put coconut oil on it, I just got some tea tree oil too
5446 2018-05-10 15:10:24 @Newsday_TT Fiscal 2018 should see a nine per cent growth in GDP, bringing TT's debt-to-GDP ratio down to below 60 per cent even despite borrowings, said Imbert. 1.3 per cent inflation in TT is better than other oil based nations.

5450 2018-05-10 15:10:08 Wild horses live on public lands in the U.S. Private interests want to use the lands for things like oil, mining, gas, ranching, so they lobby the government to remove them. These are government roundups. They're extremely inhumane. We're trying to put an end to it.

5453 2018-05-10 15:09:49 They did not push hard enough in winter testing ran to conservative so did not get the oil readings is all I can guess? 2017 oil is probably similar to 2018 so same issue.
5454 2018-05-10 15:09:48 Oil prices are booming, cant wait til gas is back over 3 bucks and those tax cuts(Fake) for the middle class start to feel like huge Tax hikes!!!

How is the world, and America in particular, safer from his ignorance of diplomacy? You are the worst kind MAGAt, you choose to be ignorant.

5465 2018-05-10 15:09:00 I dont think it is bullish vs bearish at this point - no doubt oil is over priced (and longer term bearish) but the money flow is still negative short term (dont think 71.8 is touched again today more likely 69.75)
5466 2018-05-10 15:08:56 You are the only one disagreeing and that's because you have to pay Putin back with high oil prices for him hacking you into the WH @realDonaldTrump
5467 2018-05-10 15:08:49 Didnt Imbert say in the last budget that we would not collect taxes from oil and gas for the next seven years ?
5468 2018-05-10 15:08:46 Hezbollah is people’s choice as they won Lebanon election last week, Iran supported Hamas because they’re defenseless against Israel’s raging madness and illegal blockade.

5473 2018-05-10 15:08:27 Is it true that Russia wrote off $10b as part of this peace process? And your actions in pulling out of the Iran deal have pushed up oil prices to the benefit of Russia. Sounds like a win win for Putin and his No 1 asset.

5510 2018-05-10 15:05:47 Remember, folks, lack of full access to Iranian crude was what underpinned ~$75-80 oil last time, before shale caught up and OPEC effectively ended the run.

5529 2018-05-10 15:04:13 Oil  price has been fluctuating over several decades. With increasing demand, it is increasing again. Only way to reduce the burden on the country and people is to adopt sound transport and energy policies. There is no populist solution. Private transport is no solution either
5530 2018-05-10 15:04:08 You need oil to make plastic. And you guys treat oil like nuclear waste.

And nobody is forcing you to use plastic.

5532 2018-05-10 15:04:05 Iran had a democratic moderate government till UK and USA sponsored a coup to overthrow it and install a puppet regime amenable to allowing western oil companies to plunder the nation's resources. Greed and imperialism sowed the seeds of the current problems.

5540 2018-05-10 15:03:32 Violence is the refuge of the incompetent or immoral.
From the US support for the merciless Shah of Iran to our oil grabbing invasion of Iraq, where we helped Hussein attain power, US interference has been key in exacerbating the turmoil in the region.
5541 2018-05-10 15:03:28 Ooh, you back sliding little bunch of snake oil salespersons! You used to be so supportive, but now, you've gone all Republican on us! That Brexit cocktail you've all been drinking for two years has rotted your minds out!

5543 2018-05-10 15:03:12 It was a marketing mistake. If we had showed oil leaching into the rivers (as it does), and called it a natural disaster, we could have made the industry look like heroes as they clean it up.

5551 2018-05-10 15:02:27 What needs to happen, fundamentally, for oil to reflect the inventories and present supply? In other words, what needs to happen to the fumes?
5552 2018-05-10 15:02:25 Once again, Minden's mob (Economists for Free Trade) airily dismiss reality without offering any theoretical OR factual grounding.

5558 2018-05-10 15:01:49 I'm not sure. From my quick skim of the comments, an oil change might have been up for grabs for the last man standing. Also watch the dude to the right of the 1st guy who gets obliterated. He's seen this all before and he's not concerned.

Tired of all the winning yet?

5585 2018-05-10 15:00:33 Oil use is still climbing worldwide Doug, but without pipelines to the coast Canad is losing billions due to the price differential. The US buys Canadian oil at a massive discount, and sells it at world market prices. Billions lost in revenue every year.
5586 2018-05-10 15:00:32 0時です。今日も一日、オイルと共に頑張りましょう。
5587 2018-05-10 15:00:29 お、よい子はハンターさんに任せて寝る時間だぞ！
5588 2018-05-10 15:00:28 Well, I for one can't see how a judgement can be made just yet. But I'm not convinced that @realDonaldTrump give a crap about Genie oil.
5589 2018-05-10 14:59:58 Trudeau’s family are invested in Middle East oil. Have been for 100’s of years. They don’t want Canadian oil to cause them competition! Clear selfish agenda, he doesn’t care about Canada! Who is the BC leader?
5590 2018-05-10 14:59:49 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
5591 2018-05-10 14:59:46 This article has proven is that these morally bankrupt pseudo intellectual individuals are latching on to hot button trigger topics and peddling them like snake oil salesmen and turning them into highly profitable products. Not to promote intellectual enlightenment. Its industry.
5592 2018-05-10 14:59:44 We had a VW Passat in the family at one point.  Developed an engine oil leak where the oil leaked right down onto the exhaust pipe.  Now, tell me how a car fire might start again?
5593 2018-05-10 14:59:38 It was just olive oil, lemon juice, salt and Dijon mustard
5594 2018-05-10 14:59:32 CNBC: @realDonaldTrump Iran sanctions just gave Saudi Arabia and Russia more clout in the oil market, so watch for higher prices.. (artificially high and will not be accepted lol)
5595 2018-05-10 14:59:06 Also consider watching the #CAD pairs this AM as the price of oil continues to be in the spotlight

It is still early in the NY session

5596 2018-05-10 14:59:04 @DevastationPod I would just like to apologize to the Nation first hand for a pod not being released yet. Me & @aross822 stayed up Tuesday burning the midnight oil for y’all. But @cfaust14 who not only ditched the pod recording, is now holding the content hostage. #SorryNation
5597 2018-05-10 14:58:37 Hello my friend , we are all doing we'll here too. A couple of my kitties are constantly scratching at the ears, I do treat there ears often with mite oil from the store,not sure that some cats are just more prone to getting them than others. Take care, ttyl
5598 2018-05-10 14:58:34 no not really.

Who is biggest oil holders in the middle east?

Iran and?
and with the flow of oil cut off from iran by sanctions, who's oil becomes more valuable?

btw, you know with 0 oil imports US would have a Trade Surplus of LOTS?
5599 2018-05-10 14:58:33 @Newsday_TT . New Govt had faced a 90 per cent decline in oil production, and steep drop in gas production, said Imbert.
5600 2018-05-10 14:58:22 They need Iran's ports, though. Oil producers benefit, as do stockholders, until it all blows up and gets out of hand. China, Saudi Arabia,  Russia, Iran, US, Israel--very complicated. For probably who was the weakest link at the outset, Russia sure does have a lot of power.
5601 2018-05-10 14:58:18 .@SecretaryZinke basically puts on the kibosh on offshore drilling off the Pacific coast. "There is no significant resource off the coast. There is no infrastructure to support oil and gas. There is opposition. Local voices will be heard."
5602 2018-05-10 14:58:14 Not related to Malaysia's post-election but my sister just surrendered to me oily twister potato. Got stomach ache after eating it. I can smell the oil even it is tightly lock in plastic & paper bag.
5603 2018-05-10 14:58:08 We finally have policy (45Q tax credits) in place to drive the deployment of carbon capture, at least. We’ll need to scale that up to approximately the size of the oil and gas industry, capturing CO2 from most point sources, hopefully at < $50/ton, before we transition to BECCS.
5604 2018-05-10 14:58:08 Part of this threat is the widespread forest clearance for cultivation of oil palms to yield palm oil, now found in thousands of foods. Please read ingredient list on anything you buy,especially nut butters. Palm oil is a key ingredient even in so-called all natural p'nut butter!
5605 2018-05-10 14:58:04 As a Somali citizen, we want to contract with oil exploration companies. Our country needs a rapid renaissance so that we can cope with this rapidly evolving era and overcome all the enemies who want us to divide our country. I hope you will receive this comment
5606 2018-05-10 14:57:57 Pulling out of the Iran deal was a gift to Russian oil company Rosneft. Drives up oil prices, and passes the cost onto the backs of Americans. Make no mistake: no one with knowledge believes this made US stronger. Yes
5607 2018-05-10 14:57:51 Sobra ni sa french fries na oil! 
5608 2018-05-10 14:57:50 But get off Twitter and go put a Lil oil in ya beard .. ya avi looking a lil dry
5609 2018-05-10 14:57:46 Hah I had all these plans for babes B-Day but I'm super sick  I'll try to do as much as I can but Fuck I feel like shit. I've been doing everything, eating garlic cloves, salt water gargling, apple cider vinegar, peppermint oil, sick tea, what am I missing?
5610 2018-05-10 14:57:36 Summary of my morning:
Well my ovaries are on a riot, cause my tubes are to small and "Miss Cervix" here just throwing oil to the fire,cause she is too narrow minded.
5611 2018-05-10 14:57:14 Ayun... Asked a friend hahaha if may trial ka na makita for acid toners, try mo lang. Sensitive skin din kasi sya but no harsh reaction naman sa glycolic. Deals with excess oil din kasi saka if mabreakout ka, mas mabilis madry pimples.

Jan forgets Ont & Que get All tanker Oil fr Saudi Sheiks who think women are 2nd class, Venezuela’s Killer Dictator, Africa & USA. Jan, ask Eastern freinds where there gas/oil is from?
5614 2018-05-10 14:56:50 “that foreign-imposed regime change generally does not improve relations between interveners and targets;  rather, it often makes them worse.”

Same can be applied to the wars on oil (as was the Iraqi one), which made that the oil price rose, instead of going down.
5615 2018-05-10 14:56:42 现在20%石油税要归还砂拉越，但我们是反对党州，钱要给谁？
Now that we are "negera pembangkang", how to return 20% oil royalty to Sarawak?
5616 2018-05-10 14:56:41 Sunday riley UFO oil really is my shit and helps me
5617 2018-05-10 14:56:37 @GvanOnselen is a snake oil salesman turned political analyst and a DA parrot in Chief.

5622 2018-05-10 14:56:03 It's taken like 7 years to get the followers I have now. LOL

I do block the accounts that are corporate spammers or self help accounts. They irritate me.
5623 2018-05-10 14:55:48 2/2  Japan is going to follow suit..so even if there are sanctions it will not mean anything. $80 oil does not  make a effective case for certification of the affordability of oil and regime change agenda is war.. does not help that  ..seems far fetched for now
5624 2018-05-10 14:55:47 Now playing: Pro-Pain / Operation Blood for Oil
5625 2018-05-10 14:55:47 Coconut Oil Kail I use a hair mask by Maui you shampoo then apply the mask leave it on for 5 minutes rinse my hair is getting stronger very soft very shiny it is coconut oil and shea butter
5626 2018-05-10 14:55:46 Where is Avante money coming from??  Since he's over $5mil in back taxes and the complaints against him at the bar are mounting.  Liberal and ethical are like oil and water.
5627 2018-05-10 14:55:45 proof Trudeau is just a liar ....he says he supports the pipeline but does everything he can to stop it .. Trudeau Liberals Pass Bill C-48 'Oil Tanker Ban' In House Of Commons, Which Could Crush $16 Billion Pipeline Project.
5628 2018-05-10 14:55:44 why do butts even NEED sweat glands honestly our fingertips get by fine with just oil producers just give me a megashiny ass

5630 2018-05-10 14:55:38 The citizens demand an answer for rising oil prices.  Your actions on Iran have lead to spiking gasoline prices. Say something because BoAmerica just raised crude oil prices to $100 per bbl. #OOTT
5631 2018-05-10 14:55:38 Bush ridiculously linked Saddam Hussein to the Taliban & al qaeda just before the illegal invasion of Iraq - is history about to repeat itself, Trump starting yet another oil war based on lies and disinformation?
5632 2018-05-10 14:55:34 Trump is a politician who is not a politician. He is a leader a truth teller. A get things done maverick. The slippery oil salesmen political class hate him because they can’t control him. He doesn’t play to their rules. 
They play chess,  he plays to win.
5633 2018-05-10 14:55:29 Kapoy hugas nawong. All the oil. I feel it all 
5634 2018-05-10 14:55:26 Seems someone used cooking oil in their liquid cooling...
5635 2018-05-10 14:55:14 There goes your tax cut ... middle class....just think....You put sanctions on Iranian oil ...now you have  US...Saudi Arabia...Russia...all big seller's of oil with oil hitting 80-90 dollars a barrel...and Europe and China net importer's... should be interesting
5636 2018-05-10 14:55:08 You stay away from my bacon oil country.

5640 2018-05-10 14:54:37 Bill 48 does not ban Canada from shipping oil out by tanker!.
You fell for Spencer misinformation!
5641 2018-05-10 14:54:25 We need to be creative in our rebuild. Oil and gas industry needs to diversify into green energy so as to stop putting the planet and Houston at risk and for future relevance. Grow water sucking plants on our highway walls. Plant more water sucking trees. Build more green >>>
5642 2018-05-10 14:54:21 Better yet, Pence is the snake oil & IQ45 is the conman... opps meant salesman. 
5643 2018-05-10 14:54:17 Thanks @GoNissanNorth for realizing I was one service ahead and downselling my maintenance package booking to a simple oil change.
5644 2018-05-10 14:54:15 When you get that oil change, you’re basically driving a brand new car.
5645 2018-05-10 14:54:10 Had to look up oleaginous:

1) Rich in, covered with, or producing oil; oily or greasy.

2) exaggeratedly and distastefully complimentary; obsequious.

5647 2018-05-10 14:54:08 What to do for treating #HairLoss #Naturally?
1.Take the white of one egg and mix in a teaspoon of olive oil
2.Beat to give a paste-like consistency and apply to the entire scalp and hair.
3.Keep it on for about 15 to 20 minutes and then rinse with cool water and a mild shampoo

5650 2018-05-10 14:53:56 Russia - as a net exporter of oil they suffer when prices are low. Unrest in the Middle East almost certainly will lead to increased oil prices, something Russia benefits greatly from.
5651 2018-05-10 14:53:52 And the alternative is war. The oil companies want that, the government paying to do their dirty work.
5652 2018-05-10 14:53:50 Out of every rupee a consumer in Delhi spends on petrol today, 22% goes in taxes collected by d Centre while 27% goes 2 states as sales tax. Another 9% is pocketed by dealers and oil marketing firms.

5657 2018-05-10 14:53:42 Russia is seeking influence, they have gas and oil, what they lack is a core group of allies to stare down Nato

I think Russia wants peace in the middle east- if only so Iran and Syria can flourish into wealthy allies of Russia
5658 2018-05-10 14:53:41 In fact, as mother nature’s worst ecological disaster, the oil industry is leaving it in better shape than it originally was.
5659 2018-05-10 14:53:39 ANYWAY,it’s not a joke bc someone coulda said the same thing about Brown lives and y’all woulda flipped.I’m not defending him bc he’s some white soldier dumbass,I’m just saying it’s not the time or place to nasty to someone.Ain’t nobody talking about oil or war in the 1st place

5665 2018-05-10 14:53:10 If a guy comes to town selling snake oil, I can reject his claims even with no data, due to other snake oil guys being frauds. They need to prove their product, as does religions.
5666 2018-05-10 14:53:06 Putin is very pleased with the price increase of oil.
5667 2018-05-10 14:53:06 手遅れですね
5668 2018-05-10 14:53:03 They are continuously seeping into the Athabasca River, so it's pretty easy to figure out.
Oils sands operations is actually the biggest oil spill cleanup in history.

5671 2018-05-10 14:52:58 Really Nancy? How come Ovommit had to oil his pen just like the rest of the trash he signed? Why did both parties not want to pass this to begin with? Oh, no comments on the 3 men freed from N.Korea? Didn't think so. #DEMOSTURNMYSTOAMCH

5675 2018-05-10 14:52:29 And stealing oil it is not stealing if it is their land. Like No one have a problem if a normal state take land from anouther. Like when UAE took socotra for 7 days ago.
5676 2018-05-10 14:52:21 頑張って
5677 2018-05-10 14:52:20 Don't forget allowing Putin a greater foothold in ME. OIL!It's all abt grabbing ME WEALTH, carving up world in Russia's favor, WEAKEN USA.
5678 2018-05-10 14:52:08 1/2 Iran's 2 biggest customers..China and India are not going to go along..they are going to lap up the discounted oil..the next 2  are already sending a signal that sanctions should not apply to them..South Korea is asking for a exemption (got a exemption for steel tariffs)
5679 2018-05-10 14:52:06 liking natural gas right now.  obviously oil is hot, and in my opinion will continue to remain a good buy.  but natural gas appears to be forming a strong setup, and isn't getting the attention it deserves.  went long Gulfport Energy yesterday after strong earnings beat. cheers.
5680 2018-05-10 14:52:01 I haven’t read much about the “CIA coup”, although looking it up & reading about it, it looks a bit more in depth than a “quest for oil”.
5681 2018-05-10 14:51:59 It was very clearly a statement about the unnecessary killing of animals, not your livelihoods. Nowhere did she yell “no more blood for oil”. 
Perhaps all of you could help put your strength behind this cause too? #wearestrongertogether #saynotothehorsecull

5683 2018-05-10 14:51:53 Raise oil prices & weaken Europe in one fell swoop. No more than any good employee would do. Way to go, Donald.
5684 2018-05-10 14:51:53 but Putin was low on money and it was so easy to give him what he needed just by cancelling the deal and causing oil prices to go up.  Make Russia Great Again
5685 2018-05-10 14:51:50 When I hear Facebook commercials about how they are cleaning up the mess they caused I think back to BP commercials that touted the fantastic job they were doing of gulf cleanup after their oil leak. You shouldn’t seek accolades about fixing a problem you caused in the 1st place!
5686 2018-05-10 14:51:48 You know who else benefits as much as Putin?  The American Oil Industry!  Exxon, the state of Texas, Oklahoma, the Koch refinery business--all make windfall profits during price surges.  Shared interests and values explains why Republicans are allied with Putin and his oligarchs

5689 2018-05-10 14:51:40 So what’s the point of taking time to make an appointment online for an oil change if y’all gonna take damn near an hour on something that on your site says should only take 20 mins?
5690 2018-05-10 14:51:35 Ed Morse has been wrong on oil  since it was $40. What has changed now?
5691 2018-05-10 14:51:34 But it is my daddy's energy. Screw big oil
5692 2018-05-10 14:51:32 So the next POTUS will re-trash economy, screw up school lunches, throw blacks back into the unemployment lines, make us dependent on foreign oil, reinvade Libya, give piles of cash to the Iranians, restart the NK nuke program and apologize to everyone on the planet.  Can't wait.
5693 2018-05-10 14:51:30 In a twist even the experts didn’t see coming, the United States leads the world not only in production and refining of natural gas and oil but in reduction of carbon emissions, which have reached 25-year lows due largely to greater use of clean natural gas.
5694 2018-05-10 14:51:23 Last night I woke up to really bad cramps. I didnt want to get up to smoke and I don’t take Advil’s anymore. So I rubbed coconut oil based cannabutter and it worked really fucking good.

5696 2018-05-10 14:51:17 How about you ask this WSJ guest what other countries benefit from Oil prices?  Russia!!
5697 2018-05-10 14:51:16 This is the last ditch effort the US is making so Russia and Assad don't win the war, which is inevitable. Syria serves as an important pass through pipeline for a united Russian and Syrian oil into Europe
5698 2018-05-10 14:51:14 Is @BillGates listening or waiting to enrol for aadhaar or extract the oil from it!

5705 2018-05-10 14:50:56 Oh. Is that all it is?
If u think people support oil sands simply b/c "it’s been done for a long time", then there is hope.
Take time to educate yourself on the short and long term impacts, mitigation measures, and the benefits, and then you might be able to better understand.

5716 2018-05-10 14:49:52 And... it will restrict Iranian oil driving up the price of crude. Who benefits by high crude prices?  Wait for it .......Russia!  Russia must have high crude prices/revenue to run their country. 

The great diversion! Paid for with US lives & treasure.

5718 2018-05-10 14:49:37 #AMER #AmerisurResources With high oil prices and a fully funded drilling campaign at US$45 per barrel, surely it's time to start paying dividends? This would reward patient investors, support the share price and be a  signal to the market that this is not a "Lifestyle company".

5737 2018-05-10 14:48:25 Short recap: China is very dependent on oil imports. Its Russias backyard. US have Saudi, UAE and Israel interest. Turkey is in between NATO alliance and Russia and against the Kurds. The strait of Hormuz is one of the world's most important places (oil) and its a narrow strait
5738 2018-05-10 14:48:21 trolls, bots, America's village idiots.  I don't care what you call them, I block the Trump supporters.  Period.  I have very little time left on earth and I do not ever need to listen to what they have to say, because they were stupid enough to back a snake oil salesman.
5739 2018-05-10 14:48:05 People need to up the pressure on @girlscouts to get Palm Oil out of their cookies.

5748 2018-05-10 14:47:23 Idle thought: Saw a post on HMC&E doing roadside fuel spot-checks. Now wondering if drivers whose fuel passes (Not red or chip oil) should be compensated for the amount of fuel seized for the test.
5749 2018-05-10 14:47:17 And beyond any toll, oil will be more expensive.  That's the whole point.  Tide water access lets them sell it at full price on the global market instead of discounted to the states...

5751 2018-05-10 14:47:15 It is irresponsible to have a discussion on oil and gas in Ghana without talking about climate change. Africa will be the hardest hit, what are you people doing chale. Instead of us to highlight the need for renewables we keep doing this fossil fuel thing.

5850 2018-05-10 14:40:31 Ah, how simple minds work. Crazy that no one else has thought to use that unlimited supply of oil just buried under the US’s soil. God bless you.
5851 2018-05-10 14:40:28 No no, no oil. Only yelling.
5852 2018-05-10 14:40:19 A damaged old oil painting of a horse. I see some symbolism with the horses head being cut off. Maybe that’s saying they’re done with the horse riding era. Pair that with, “Never Be the Same” and it confirms they’re doing something totally different than they’ve ever done before.

5854 2018-05-10 14:40:06 The economy's gotten a lot more diverse (we're really high in medical, and starting to get some startup traffic), but oil still by and large runs the state. It's an ongoing fight.

(I've never seen flammable tap water myself, but rural areas might.)
5855 2018-05-10 14:40:04 Besides the liberalised oil prices. The extra tax is being used to reduce the fiscal deficit and the Banks NPAs
5856 2018-05-10 14:40:01 The #oil market is still awaiting @USTreasury's OFAC for guidance -- that's not the "Office of Foreign Assets Control". After first Rusal and now #Iran, it's now known as the "Office of Foreign Administration of Commodities" (h/t the executive (anonymous) who suggested it) #OOTT

5911 2018-05-10 14:35:08 President Trump's decision to restart sanctions on Iran has lifted oil prices and energy stocks.
5912 2018-05-10 14:35:06 oil prices?  what are u doing w/that?
5913 2018-05-10 14:35:03 As a totally uneducated person, here is my guess. Netanyahu provided a bogus excuse for treaty violation.  Within hours, he shot missiles at Syria then screamed that retaliatory strikes were aggression from Iran. Providing a pretext for the war and oil grab Trump wants.
5914 2018-05-10 14:35:02 Yep, we need more conservatives in oil and gas..........
5915 2018-05-10 14:34:59 This weekend I think we will start to tune up the bikes we lend out.  See what needs new parts then lube oil and clean them up.   As summer approaches we will run out of time faster than fast.
5916 2018-05-10 14:34:59 1 1979 was when Iran managed to oust the US imposed murderous dictator the Shah of Iran. 
 In 1951, Mohammad Mosaddegh was appointed as the Prime Minister. He became enormously popular in Iran after he nationalized Iran's petroleum industry and oil reserves.
5917 2018-05-10 14:34:56 The #GlobalWarming nazis in King County, WA are suing oil companies for downplaying the #ClimateChange hoax.

Hey King County, haven't you been reading? The science is settled. Climate change was invented by the Left to control the economy. They FAILED.

5930 2018-05-10 14:33:41 People in iran may suffer from US sanctions on oil,But we are ready to tolerate poverty،instead of seeing that the dictatorial Islamic regime of Iran will not last much longer
5931 2018-05-10 14:33:40 While the benefits of low oil prices to the global economy and resulting increase in emissions are well considered, a neglected factor is motorist immorality which is exacerbated by low oil prices. However, dangerously fast Teslas will enable motorists to evade high oil prices.
5932 2018-05-10 14:33:36 It was under obama that ISIS were defeated. SA always sides with the US as do the Emirates because of oil links and rivalry with Iran.
5933 2018-05-10 14:33:30 If you look at incentives, it's very clear who one should believe. At this point, it's up to the oil industry to show that humans did NOT create climate change, and even if it's not created by humans, that it's not a worrying long term trend. They have the resources.

5938 2018-05-10 14:33:11 The price of oil will rise giving Putin enough income to make good on his campaign promises. Putin loves this "president" to bits.
5939 2018-05-10 14:32:51 Israel’s goal also dovetails with the US’ — to dismantle these states that would resist the arrival of US and Western companies, particularly oil, back into the region. Also Russia must be isolated globally. This requires the destruction of all allies.

5942 2018-05-10 14:32:35 An unstable Middle East leads to higher oil prices, which leads to higher gas cost for Americans. Who does it help? The Saudis and wait for it.......Putin! Russia whole economy is just oil. That and cyber crime.    #payoff

5946 2018-05-10 14:32:05 Is that what we call "oil" now?
5947 2018-05-10 14:32:03 Part of that is that state economy fell through the floor a couple of years ago when oil collapsed, and because of weird business tax laws the oil companies basically haven't had to pay any tax in a while due to the losses they took. Some of our local reporters have covered it.
5948 2018-05-10 14:32:02 The other definition you list in your website works for him, too: “Oily; resembling or having the properties of oil.”
5949 2018-05-10 14:31:59 If he'd placed it on the ceiling, he'd spend a fortune in Windex.  Fiscal conservative.
5950 2018-05-10 14:31:37 So who should we believe? A few companies who make billions every day from selling oil, or thousands of people who want to boost their egos?
Note that Americans think it's a "new" problem. Not in Europe, where it's been taught in schools since the 1980s (or earlier).

5984 2018-05-10 14:28:26 Feeling like you got the co-chair short-straw, Gen?!? If it makes you feel any better today was v hard work - tasting oils, discussion about olive oil in the diet, 5-course lunch, lovely wines... no fun at all 
5985 2018-05-10 14:28:14 yes now lets hear Keowns reply i guess something on .." you keep to being a agent and leave the commentary to those that have played the game" or " if oil has got something to say to me he should say it to my face"

5989 2018-05-10 14:27:47 I do know inside of the machine there was oily droplets and the sweet taste of glycerine so chances are very high its oil based.

5991 2018-05-10 14:27:27 ... that’s not how things work, buddy. You should read up on major players of both Crude and Oil and learn some basic micro and macroeconomic concepts. It will help you out in life.
5992 2018-05-10 14:27:22 did the same thing with $FB below $20, as well as $XLE when it was making lows near $50 and dozens of oil shares when people hated Oil.... ya we don't need that anymore....

5995 2018-05-10 14:27:13 I remember when $60 oil call seemed crazy now BofA is at $100 (potentially ) @BofA_News

Besides, it’s the pipes not the rigs that are the problem as far as I know
5998 2018-05-10 14:27:04 When I didn't noticed the sauce pan has already cooking oil and it is already hot...

Me: WTF! *jumps* *curses a bit while showering her right leg within 20 minutes* (and many more wincing and crying at the shower room)

Inner me: JUSKO ANG SOBRANG SAKIT!!
5999 2018-05-10 14:27:01 No, no they're not. This corruption is worse than can imagine, it is deep & convoluted. Follow the $$ the oil. Defending Israel puts us also at odds with our Allies.
Nothing good to come of this.
Pulling out was big mistake on many levels.

6004 2018-05-10 14:26:38 Iraq attempted to switch from the petrodollar to a petroEuro and the US invaded, Libya attempted a petroDinar backed by gold, that country was destroyed, last week, Iran switched from USD to Euro for its oil, and suddenly there's a hot war #finalsdaysofanempire

6007 2018-05-10 14:26:27 The real deal is energy. Iran wants to go 100% nuclear power plant energy to supply it's country's energy needs. This would allow Iran to export all the oil it produced. This would provide Iran with a stable national income and increased economic partnerships.

6016 2018-05-10 14:25:37 No that's not true, the deal is broken in interest of US oil companies. The responsible countries, Iran, Russia, China, France, UK and EU stand by their commitment to the signed agreement

6019 2018-05-10 14:25:28 Don't discount the possibility that he was pushed to do it by his Russian handlers. Look at the immediate run-up in oil prices.
6020 2018-05-10 14:25:20 US President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal is bad news for the oil market, remittance income flows, current account deficit, the value of the rupee & inflation. The US is doing serious damage to it's own leadership. Sri Lanka must say so
6021 2018-05-10 14:25:16 the way i see it, taxes, in the Saudi context, is nothing but an attempt at a fair distribution of wealth (although income tax would be much more useful in this regard). After all, the wealth in Saudi ultimately comes from one source: oil.

6024 2018-05-10 14:24:46 Yeah no it wasn't - he got rid of oil regulations because he got political donations from the oil industry, a "i pat you on the back, you pat me" action.
6025 2018-05-10 14:24:45 I'm in the midst of reporting a story on this and don't think there's talk of a complete palm oil import ban, just for biofuel. That would be about 40% of Europe's imports.

6029 2018-05-10 14:24:32 Today’s olive oil tasting with @belazu_co was led by the lovely @judyoliveoil. I taste so many vinegars I find switching to evaluating olive oils a real challenge, so this was a palate-inspiring education for me on how to appreciate their different elements.
6030 2018-05-10 14:24:30 How stupid!!  No one runs for PM in Canada.  The PM is selected by the Governor General from the party with the most seats in parliament.  By your comments about Alberta's oil sands, you should take over from Elizabeth May who is an American.
6031 2018-05-10 14:24:27 @POTUS Every time you raise oil prices the rent and food go up not going to work time for a freeze on food and rent and gas prices and make the crooks drop there prices just saying your defeating your purpose.And your hurting your chances of reelection please help your friend

6036 2018-05-10 14:24:00 You are really funny.  You are like a gas station in the middle of nowhere, vs. America - the oil exploration, refining and distribution.  Of course you have less population and higher income, no one wants work for the Gas Station, they want to work for the   Relevant guys.

6038 2018-05-10 14:23:53 Correct.
6039 2018-05-10 14:23:39 They were defending the deal because Iran was complying with the deal.  US companies who deal with Iran are now going to suffer and it will impact American jobs aka Boeing and oil ...  and let’s not forget gas prices

6051 2018-05-10 14:22:21 Look, the first thing trump did as president was dance with the Saudis. Do you really think he didn't make deals to marginalize Iran & drive up oil prices, & pocket a few million himself.
6052 2018-05-10 14:22:18 Lol, yes those countries which has oil (which India buys to make them rich) is doing so much favor by hiring few Indian employees like those countries have talent in abundance and hiring only to help India :) Why don't you go there to help bit more.

Do citizens support Perpetual War? No!
6058 2018-05-10 14:21:56 And Iran needs a peaceful nuclear energy programme because it is a bit short of oil and solar power.

6070 2018-05-10 14:21:02 The Saudis said they would make up any oil shortfall due to loss of Iranian oil , perhaps in violation of its OPEC pact; Netanyahu meets Putin; Yemen fires missiles at Saudi Arabia; Iran fires missiles at Israeli Syrian locations; Israel fire on Iranians.  DJT gets distraction
6071 2018-05-10 14:21:00 Oil price spikes are an excellent example of why Trump's policies to ramp up oil production and give us more control of the world markets and our foreign policy is better than letting the Socialist climate change cult keep everything in the ground.

6083 2018-05-10 14:20:08 It’s all about making the oil $ go up. Who benefits, the Saudis and the Russians. Crude has been on a steady rise since Mr Trump began his “stay tuned” nonsense. Just something to add to the list of “why”.

6117 2018-05-10 14:17:13 This guy is an NDPer he thinks government is the only source of industry. Wake up, these are private US oil companies that make these decisions. If Canada would get over squander it’s greatest natural resource under trudumb we would actually not be running a deficit.

6120 2018-05-10 14:17:03 So food and drinks companies are legally obliged to state what their ingredients are but they don't have to say where they are from. Does that sound a bit wrong? Greggs say the palm oil they use in their cloudy lemonade is from a sustainable source...

6146 2018-05-10 14:14:56 Yup. The Iran Agreement was a “bad deal” because it didn’t make him and his cronies money. Just talking about  withdrawing from it automatically made oil prices jump, and he’s making money now.

6177 2018-05-10 14:12:35 LOL... that's funny. "Death to America" and Iran getting nukes vs. lower oil prices. If they actually nuked us, gas prices wouldn't matter... If #GovernorTaxman allowed offshore drilling in NJ, maybe we could have cheaper gas. And then he'd raise taxes again...

6181 2018-05-10 14:12:16 Merkel is a fool.  The US has always subsidized Europe by protecting trade lanes and oil routes into Europe while the Europeans shirk their duties and then maximize trade with those actors (Iran) who are seeking to seize control of trade routes (Bab el Mandeb).
6182 2018-05-10 14:12:08 These are the same guys that at 147$ oil was talkng about 200$......at 40$ were advocating 20$.... and they use the words "could" "would"..... I am wondering what are they doing in their offices.... Acutally I have a clear idea but i am not gonna say anything about it.....

6187 2018-05-10 14:11:44 I tried them for pain. Only made me high as a kite. The oil did nothing for me either.
6188 2018-05-10 14:11:40 She @jannarden is a hypocrite. She flies and drives everywhere for her concerts. She needs to be educated that oil is extracted in most responsible way, meeting federal requirements, in Canada unlike other regimes such as Iran, Venezuela and others. It’s a shame she is Canadian.
6189 2018-05-10 14:11:38 I was reading last night that this also helps Putin. Destabilizing the ME causes a spike in the price of oil.  Pushing it above $70 a barrel, alleviating Putin's financial problems.

6259 2018-05-10 14:05:54 Gas prices are of course directly affected by oil cost and that is always directly proportional to cost of steel, when Obama killed the steel industry gas went through the roof, you can study for yourself, it's true, and the steel fix that Trump did hasn't caught up yet.

6292 2018-05-10 14:03:04 The price of oil is inching up because Trump’s buddies Russia and Saudi’s Arabia are tightening supplies, and as we know he will not take a stand against them. The rising price of gas is the “TrumpTax” on average Americans. #Resist

6390 2018-05-10 13:54:34 Why is everyone talking about the price of oil. The price of oil is the least of our problems if our children are called to war. That is all the President Trump wants is a war war war because then we won’t be able to get them out. He needs to be removed from office
6391 2018-05-10 13:54:11 She was talking to the lib, it just looked like she wasn't. Twitter embed issues.
6392 2018-05-10 13:54:02 No Melissa, based on your tweets. Man you need help.
6393 2018-05-10 13:54:00 Say goodbye to sorrow & sadness today.  Invite the Holy Spirit to replace it with joy & gladness!
Isaiah 61:3 “To grant those who mourn in Zion, Giving them a garland instead of ashes, The oil of gladness instead of mourning, The mantle of praise instead of a spirit of fainting.”
6394 2018-05-10 13:53:57 if some art person mentions OOO to me I just say yes my friend, I too find oil of oregano useful for defense against infection in the throat.
6395 2018-05-10 13:53:36 The year is 2032. Religion is all but nonexistent and alternatives to oil and fuel have been discovered and are plentiful. Wars are now started over people's beliefs of the shape of the earth.
6396 2018-05-10 13:53:19 For stating the truth? LOL
6397 2018-05-10 13:53:08 Yay free oil changes!

6400 2018-05-10 13:52:51 There are many and complex reasons why some localities prosper and others don't. No one lost their houses post-Civil War in Lagos for instance hence attributing  its success simply to oil is a simplistic argument. Over 50.6% of banking deposits in NGR today are in Lagos.
6401 2018-05-10 13:52:43 The Zionists are because Golan heights is over flowing with oil
6402 2018-05-10 13:52:40 How about clearing away all the trees and drilling for oil

6421 2018-05-10 13:51:38 Trump is ruled by the Putin playbook. The Iran move boosts oil (and gas) prices and that salvages Russia's economy. Trump takes his orders from Vlad. #PutinsPuppet #TraitorTrump
6422 2018-05-10 13:51:37 But... Israel has no oil.
6423 2018-05-10 13:51:37 this is you when i asked if you'd put oil in the lambo.............
6424 2018-05-10 13:51:36 Economy can't sustain that price of oil.
6425 2018-05-10 13:51:20 It's actually more properly termed "tar slurry". It's energy to be sure, but a very dirty, coarse grade of oil.

6429 2018-05-10 13:50:56 Higher oil prices on order on many fronts particularly sourcing; don't believe that domestic abilities can ameliorate increased cost.

6435 2018-05-10 13:50:08 #ReasonsIGotGrounded  I hid a bottle of Crown Royal under the seat of my car.  My dad went 2 check my oil, the CR had leaked out & my car reeked of alcohol & it was a hot day, let that sink in 4 a  minute... I'll wait. He brings in the bottle & makes me pour it down the drain.
6436 2018-05-10 13:50:05 Yup. Saudis will love nukes going off next door. Also remember, the rest of the parties aren’t pulling out of the agreement. So the sanctions won’t have much affect.  Downside- oil prices go up and Boeing loses billions in contract. Mazel tov!
6437 2018-05-10 13:49:59 Fat ‘allowance’ included in modelling for 2013, 10g polyunsaturated margarine, 14 serves/wk, or 7g oil, 10g seeds/nuts. Fats also obtained from core foods as well as ‘extras’.
6438 2018-05-10 13:49:52 Attending @NCEnergyForum discussion, learning @ energy mix now and in future- oil and gas will be part of the mix.  Cost of energy matters
6439 2018-05-10 13:49:51 So what did Trump just negotiate for us then? The money is gone, Iran is free to restart its nuclear program 8 years earlier than it would have under the deal, and you & I will have to pay A LOT more in oil & gas prices. We won’t be trusted to make a new deal. How is that a win?
6440 2018-05-10 13:49:46 I heard on NPR today that US oil businesses will be helped by the price increases following Trump pulling us out of the Iran treaty. Also, stock market up for same reason. Kochs are oil guys. Anyone confused about who is running US foreign policy? Or why this is happening?
6441 2018-05-10 13:49:33 Hon opp. leader @R_Sampanthan ,I strongly believe you must involve and raise your voice against (at least) the price hike of Kerosene oil as many poor people specially in estates are still using kerosene for their daily routines! Its by Rs 57/- So, how they can bear it?
6442 2018-05-10 13:49:32 Si tiene que ser una petrolera, que sea Oil of Olay...!!!
6443 2018-05-10 13:49:30 Strategic food reserve like what we do for oil. A good option.
6444 2018-05-10 13:49:26 This is not just about the nukes. It's, as usual, more abt the oil and natural gas bidness, specifically liquified natural gas being produced and sold
6445 2018-05-10 13:49:26 オイルだからってオイルツイートばかりな訳じゃないぞ。油ツイートもするよ。
6446 2018-05-10 13:49:15 Really worried about Israel aren’t you. Europe’s interest in buying oil from Iran and our security are two different issues and if you think that Iran stopped activity on it’s nuclear program because of that appeasement deal Obama made, you are delusional. #Palletsofcash
6447 2018-05-10 13:49:12 Higher oil prices are just what Putin needs.
6448 2018-05-10 13:49:10 1) That's certainly not true. Gov`t subsidizes farms, schools, oil, etc.
2) I stand by my opinions, witty or not.
3) You are railing against abortion, so it must still be an issue despite the efforts of schools/parents.
4) Not obsessed. I thought we were having a discussion here.

6461 2018-05-10 13:47:55 Yes, that's right - Israel will sic the Americans on Syria to "defend" their oil in the Golan Heights.
6462 2018-05-10 13:47:55 Rising oil prices are just what Russia needs to prop up their failing economy.
6463 2018-05-10 13:47:49 The discount isnt a new thing why do you think Harper was trying to get multiple pipelines to tidewater built. He grossly underestimated the underlying influence of the US to keep our oil available to them and them only.

6471 2018-05-10 13:47:21 Was Lagos collecting part of the extra allocation as oil producing states, or the extra allocation given to the delta regions because of the oil been sucked was been taking back from them by federal government?

6475 2018-05-10 13:47:14 Red stain sounds like an infused fat for sure. Try lots of butter and/or oil, simmer/steep the cacciatore in it to extract their flavor, and maybe try tomato paste too for a deeper, more extracted effect than sauce alone can give. W/o tasting it, that’s about the best I can do ;)

6492 2018-05-10 13:45:28 yes, though I wish i knew enough about semiconductor pricing to know if that plays a role

more generally, we will see East Asian surpluses fall and GCC/ Russian surpluses rise with the oil swing.   Challenge is catching any trend on top of that

6494 2018-05-10 13:45:24 Yet fail to decrease when oil drops? Apparently because they buy a year in advance so, why is it instant when oil rises? Thieves and parasites lot of them
6495 2018-05-10 13:45:21 Reasons: oil profits, war materiel profits, & wagging the dog. Pretty transparent; same thinking behind the Iraq Fiasco. [per Thomas E. Ricks' title]
6496 2018-05-10 13:45:17 Not against it. I just want to see this years results. Year one Dak did great but split those stats out and look at year two and it’s not so glamorous. I want Dak to set the world on fire and be that guy. But for now let’s put the anointing oil away. Dak needs to earn it.

6521 2018-05-10 13:43:33 Catch-22 - Iran can produce oil cheaper than Saudi Arabia - Saudi Arabia would sell USA debt treasuries if Trump had not done this - End of the Petro-dollar and not only American standard of living but a global depression should American economy fall --- this is the reality !!!

6525 2018-05-10 13:43:19 Good for those countries & corporations that benefit. Bad for consumer. Iran & Libya produce very high grade crude oil.

6594 2018-05-10 13:37:45 It wasn't about Iran having power but Europe having Iran as a trading partner. They need their oil. The sanctions also hurt Europe. This is the reason that it will be almost impossible to put the sanctions back in place.
6595 2018-05-10 13:37:40 My coconut oil is somehow still solid. Very thankful.
6596 2018-05-10 13:37:33 True, especially with rice, for me. I've seen something about normal vegetable oil beans somewhere. Still investigating. I need to find out if it's a thing and how to do it, so I can cook it. Can't be any worse than palm oil beans.

6620 2018-05-10 13:35:11 Restrictions, absolutely, would have to be well thought out and monitored to avoid incentives for corruption.

I'd be hesitant to have blanket bans... If the person is a oil and gas worker, for instance, it's not unreasonable for them to return to their old career.

It's stupid because the election literally just ended 16 hours ago

6671 2018-05-10 13:30:50 Oil per barrel prices continue to rise even though we are producing more than ever This will choke off purchasing power if it continues. Oil refineries are NOT being invested in. Not sure if current refineries are back to capacity after hurricanes? We must stop the continual rise

6674 2018-05-10 13:30:44 @POTUS Gas prices are climbing. Why is that? I thought we were loosening regulations so we would be energy independent? If we produce enough oil in America, why are we still buying oil from Arab nations?
6675 2018-05-10 13:30:34 Today I get to work only to discover that my salad dressing has exploded all over the inside of my bag. As I was in the bathroom scrubbing olive oil out of the seems of my purse, I couldn't help but think a burger would never do this to me.

6706 2018-05-10 13:27:05 but you wouldn't accept that answer if you substitute 'Railway' with 'oil production', 'fracking', 'road building' or frankly any other business. I'm not talking about not chopping down trees, I'm just saying 'chopping down trees' is not the same as a plan to maintain it.

6724 2018-05-10 13:25:07 I'll add, honesty with yourself.  Easy to get rattled if you don't know WHY you are holding, and WHY you still should, or shouldn't. Too few either know the WHY, or have the ability to accept being wrong, or right, when it is obvious, despite what the mkt says. It isn't gut feel!

6741 2018-05-10 13:22:57 I pointed out higher prices (at the pump and on the shelves) to my rep @PeterRoskam and have yet to hear a rebuttal or plan on how these increases are going to be dealt with. I think he's too invested in big oil to care.

Iran has oil, the lifeblood of our economy, Israel has nothing to give us, except debt and lost lives. 

I’m sure Iran is our enemy now...

6752 2018-05-10 13:21:39 oil price increase will cut the reported surplus in about 1/2.    puts it in the $50-100b range so close to balance.

but reported surplus itself understates the true surplus by about $100b b/c it overstates tourism imports (which include disguised outflows)

Which will make it harder to export oil from Iran who is a major producer in the middle eastern and member of OPEC. Will see above 85$ a brl which can push gas to 4$ per gallon.

6791 2018-05-10 13:18:02 " is this just some blag to cause oil prices to rise further?" Yeah, you're not the only people to wonder this.

6793 2018-05-10 13:17:46 Cdn$ is up again today with Oil up to $71/barrel, don’t forget to manage your “Basis Risk!”

6795 2018-05-10 13:17:29 This isn't a SIDE-EFFECT of trashing the Iran deal, it's a DESIRED EFFECT. The higher oil prices are exactly what Putin needs - so I guess the Russians invested wisely when they bought djt.
6796 2018-05-10 13:17:19 Astagaaaa. Hahahahhaha kmk makey Hada Labo Cleansing Oil. Terkejut juak la molah nya faded. Haha
6797 2018-05-10 13:17:19 Yup. Said this to my partner weeks ago. Putin's chess move to make Dotard look good. And getting Dotard to pull out of Iran deal increases oil prices to help Putin.

'Our coal, oil and gas have made us a much more prosperous country.

But now they're running out, we ban anyone from looking for any more.

We demand an Independent, Poverty-Stricken Scotland!'

6801 2018-05-10 13:17:07 He should be home witnessing it himself and not fighting an illegal war on behalf of big oil. Our soldiers are used as a political chip and viewed as expendable. Either work at Walmart or get shipped off to kill even poorer and more desperate people. #BringOurTroopsHome #Congrats
6802 2018-05-10 13:16:55 Lol oh really look on any oil companies web site and they would have you believe that they are all stewards of the environment. If you really look at their investments in alternatives they mainly exsist where direct gov subsidies are provided.
6803 2018-05-10 13:16:53 Oh good idea... poison the aquifers so in future we can buy distilled water at $10 a gallon... for the sake of cheap oil and reduced CAFE standards, no passenger trains, no trolleys...
6804 2018-05-10 13:16:52 How about we start with you? How much money Haliburt paid you for the 1st war, & how much GENIE oil company is going to pay you, for stealing Syrian oil, with the blood of Americans to fatten your bank account?
6805 2018-05-10 13:16:51 Oil prices can destroy Iran, Russia, and oil exporters. Manufacturers like China can negotiate and disrupt the market suppliers, but substitutes like India and others can change the outcomes soon.
6806 2018-05-10 13:16:47 Totally an oligarch maneuver to keep scumbags in power...watch for every one of them to pile on support. They make money on rising oil costs, and selling uranium while consolidating power and destroying democracy.
6807 2018-05-10 13:16:31 And the country will rebound dramatically; 

something the Democrats can’t afford to let it happen; 

they don’t want a strong America that works like a well oil machine;

they would preferred to destroy America to keep their control.

6810 2018-05-10 13:16:14 Upstream oil companies like ONGC gained 3% to close at Rs188 on account of benefit of increased oil price.

6816 2018-05-10 13:15:51 It’s just another reason to keep an eye on the Iran/Israel situation. At the height of Iraq & Afghanistan we were paying close to $6.00 a gallon on a regular basis (no pun intended) in South Florida. US doesn’t get a ton of oil from Iran, but our other trade partners do.
6817 2018-05-10 13:15:48 Brent crude futures reached $77.50 per barrel on Thursday (Reuters), the highest price since 2014. The increase comes amid expectations of market disruption following a U.S. decision to reinstate sanctions on Iran, which produces around 4 percent of the global oil supply.

6820 2018-05-10 13:15:36 This is so funny because  your President knew something like this would happen . You all want them at war so the greedy USA  can take their oil. Pure evil and greed. Now wonder those countries don’t trust the USA

6833 2018-05-10 13:14:48 One thing people are not talking about is the how pulling out of the Iran deal actually boosts Russia's economy substantially through higher oil prices. It may not be all about undoing Obama's legacy.
6834 2018-05-10 13:14:34 There no problem. Poppi made of special alloy. No need for rust or oil.
6835 2018-05-10 13:14:34 Think it was just due to cool off. After touching a 5 year high, likely just some profit taking with investors thinking Oil was going to pull back here,  don't think it's related to earnings.

6852 2018-05-10 13:13:18 Hi hello, an oil pipeline is not equivalent to building a railroad across Canada. Better equivalents: cross-country mass public transit (high speed trains, anyone?), universal high-speed internet access & fast affordable shipping services across the country. #cdnpoli

6854 2018-05-10 13:13:11 Prices had fallen sharply earlier in the day because fear of the Reserve  Bank of India raising interest rates intensified after crude oil prices continued with their upward trajectory today. The yield on 10-year G-sec ended at 7.71% similar to yesterday’s close.

6857 2018-05-10 13:12:59 @jimcramer all that is needed for oil to go higher is the supply v demand story to play out over the summer. Going to see significant inventory draws to meet demand. Levels will fall far below 5 yr average.

And do ‘t be too sure climate change isn’t going to wreck your children’s world as well we are not immune.
6910 2018-05-10 13:08:20 Then you need to take a close look at #NAFTA because it forces us to import and export oil, whether we need to or not....hence the term free trade. So the goal is to keep and refine our oil ...and charge Canandian consumers gasoline in USD just for a few jobs?

6926 2018-05-10 13:06:50 Okay, it is too different a topic. In my view as long as India uses Oil, does not have ample exports and no fiscal prudence, the inflation targets and forcasts by rbi are day dreams. Also if inflation is low, growth would be low too, leading to lesser return from equity too!

7052 2018-05-10 12:56:29 Crazy how just two years ago the talk was oil is done and it will never go above $40s. Energy stocks are staging a massive comeback $HP $RIG $SMHI @jimcramer @SquawkCNBC
7053 2018-05-10 12:56:29 Remember Trump SUPPORTS fracking which is what created the oil glut in the first place.
7054 2018-05-10 12:56:26 We're very sorry for the confusion amigo! We have recently switched over from soy oil. We can assure you that we no longer have any soy products in our restaurants. We have touched base with the management team at the restaurant so that everyone is on the same page.

7058 2018-05-10 12:56:04 Why don't you idiots that fully support this moron blow smoke up his ass about the Iran nuke deal, because not only are oil prices going to soar, but most of the Middle-East will now be building nuclear weapons. And you guys were bitching about being the world's police before??
7059 2018-05-10 12:56:01 โอ้ยซากุระน่ารักอ่าา
7060 2018-05-10 12:55:51 Trump's latest stable genius move has handed over the Middle East to Russia and Iran (who will no doubt be working in our best interests, right?). It has made Russian oil much more valuable, allowing them to strengthen their military. It's going to paid for out of our pockets.
7061 2018-05-10 12:55:46 Calm, just throw me some land with oil or at least some sort of state contract

7063 2018-05-10 12:55:37 Any of y'all use CBD oil? Where do y'all but from? I currently order from  Bluebird Botanicals but I'm open to other suppliers
7064 2018-05-10 12:55:31 The point about causality is a good one. Still I think the oil market has offered a cushion to the market, but effect size cannot be determined. Counter-factual analysis is impossible, yes.

7066 2018-05-10 12:55:17 For Healthy skin

7068 2018-05-10 12:55:10 There's a direct inverse correlation between dollars spent in the travel & tourism industries and rates of poaching. More east African safaris, less poaching. Also less oil development.

7072 2018-05-10 12:55:01 Yes I am not sure why I started to call them ''rebels'' I did call them terrorists for a long time. When they had the oil and were growing fast a lot were just mercenaries. I think that was when I changed.

7086 2018-05-10 12:53:51 -Trump has been noted to show unusually favorable behavior to Russia and Saudi Arabia 
-Trump withdraws from Iran agreement.
-As a result, oil prices go up, benefiting countries like Saudi Arabia and Russia.

This doesn't seem to be to difficult to understand... #TrumpRussia

7088 2018-05-10 12:53:45 In addition : Who benefits from high oil prices?  1.  USA 2. KSA  3. Russia  Who loses?  1. China 2. India (Pak as well) Venezuela is in tatters and Iran has been hit. You take out 2 Irans from the supply side (3 -5 lac less barrels per day)

Who will fill the void? Uncle SAM ;)

7093 2018-05-10 12:53:27 You miss the consequence of Trump’s withdrawal in raising oil prices, which then helps fund KSA’s program.
South Africa managed with a lot lower GDP, also Pakistan and India, so the cost barrier is probably lower than you think.
7094 2018-05-10 12:53:24 I agree with u @RickeySmiley if he's pounding you down you make 4get about that oil change
7095 2018-05-10 12:53:10 The tax cut was a con. Cut taxes, implement policies that cause gas prices to rise, and watch the money flow through the tax cut pipeline from D.C through middle America and into the hands of Oil & Gas Industry CEOs, executives & shareholders.

7100 2018-05-10 12:52:31 The Trump voters will be flooding all the military recruiting stations immediately.  They rr happy to fight and die to make Saudi oil sheikhs even richer, and everyone else pay more for gas.
7101 2018-05-10 12:52:27 People with any knowledge will buy whatever makes sense if the results are obvious and self-evident.

If you have to label it AI for them to buy it, you're selling magical snake's oil. No customer should ever have to know why your tool works.
7102 2018-05-10 12:52:26 You’ve literally taxed everything, you’ve taken from both rich and poor while running a deficit, a carbon tax you can’t quantify as who pays what? You’ve lobbied against the Oil Sands and energy sector on behalf of less that 3% of the population and helped kill the East pipeline
7103 2018-05-10 12:52:23 The average American household was expected to get roughly $600 benefit from the GOP tax bill. Higher oil prices thanks to Trump decision to leave the Iran treaty are likely to cost same family about $200, reducing the GOP’s “gift” by one-third.
7104 2018-05-10 12:52:11 John Bolton and Mike Pimpeo are warmongering Israeli puppets since 1759. Its all about Syria's oil and Iran's central bank
7105 2018-05-10 12:52:09 Use American oil and gas and coal.  Sell oil to other countries.

7186 2018-05-10 12:45:18 Unless Putin supplies Syria with S300 missiles defense, like Iran has, the total Russian intervention is useless.

Russia, China, Iran intend to invest heavily in Syria's oil infrasturcture, so they need also to protect their future investments by delivering military support.

7241 2018-05-10 12:40:43 What inflation? Benign CPI data this morning. Energy starting to show up, reflecting higher oil prices, but core is still modest at 0.1%. no reason for long rates to rise on this data. Over the last 3 months core inflation was 1.8% (AR) lowest since last summer. @CushWake

7244 2018-05-10 12:40:33 Nothing to say about deliberately rising the price of oil for the incoming Saudi IPO ? 
7245 2018-05-10 12:40:28 The two are unrelated. Spot oil rally simply due to curve strengthening (because inventories declined sharply). 5y fwd price unchanged (which should be impacted by Inflation expectations). That is yet to come (whole curve goes up).

Trump don’t like certain ppl based on Obama’s past! Any yes it would be great to sit at the table w all leaders and make it great lol come on
7369 2018-05-10 12:29:37 We use oil as part of ingredients to make soap, it is the same soap we use to wash our clothes when stained by oil. Magu I understand you, but Nigerians are wiser now.

7372 2018-05-10 12:29:27 When you plugged in & you don’t have to wait for an oil change 
7373 2018-05-10 12:29:21 Ok, the oil industry is also on the decline.  You can probably guess what I think of that.  What about other industries?
7374 2018-05-10 12:29:20 It’s one of your biggest lies. You don’t give a shit for people of Iran. You have said repeatedly Iran needs to be invaded for its oil &other natural resources. You are working for Netanyahu, Sheldon Adelson, & other billionaires who want the destruction of Iran. Immoral POS.
7375 2018-05-10 12:29:12 It's great. If you're Russian. Iran is 3rd largest oil producer, Trump will boycott or go to war with them. Oil prices rise, Russia gets more revenue, and Putin achieves his huge programme of public spending. Meanwhile, the US will suffer increased fuel costs.

7380 2018-05-10 12:28:59 You don't even know what you are talking about. Gas and oil prices have been at a 15 year low the last couple of years. Prices are now up 21% from just last year.
7381 2018-05-10 12:28:54 Who benefits from high oil prices?  1.  USA.  2 KSA.  3. Russia.  Who loses?  1. China 2. India.  If you hobble Iran & Venezuela you take out 2 Irans from the supply side.  Uncle Sams got it all figured out but can’t say it aloud.

7385 2018-05-10 12:28:32 So, all that tax cut money the “middle-class” is getting is all going to be going toward gas (and beer) because Iran made sure oil went up
7386 2018-05-10 12:28:30 Funny how petrol prices stay so high when oil comes down and the excuse is they bought the oil at last years price when it was higher so they charge last years prices! Yet, instantly put price up at same time when oil costs increase? Odd

7423 2018-05-10 12:25:07 Oil prices will now go up, despite being stable for 10 years. Russian revenue from oil production increases, and Putin enacts huge public spending initiatives on infrastructure. I guess you'll get some favours off the back of this one.

7428 2018-05-10 12:24:58 The problem is we aren't, we build more pipelines instead of developing alternatives.  The government is still subsidizing oil exploration, if the subsidized alternative energy like the oil industry, the patch would have a closed for business sign already.

7430 2018-05-10 12:24:52 It wasn't "Iran's" money in the bank.  It was US funds placed there to pay companies for the military supplies Iran was paying for with OIL.  As oil was received, the loan was reduced.  Iran never paid off loan.
7431 2018-05-10 12:24:51 Oil prices have been increasing long before the US quitting the Iran deal.  They started to increase when the Iran deal was reached with Iran by Obama, et. al.  It has nothing to do with government, it has to do with the oil companies scared to death of the low commodities market

7444 2018-05-10 12:24:02 I live in So Cal and know about the switch to summer blend.  what you are leaving out is the cost of oil immediately jumping up after trump’s pull out of the Iran deal. Funny how past presidents were blamed for gas prices but trump gets a pass.

7459 2018-05-10 12:22:36 Yesterday we rallied based on higher oil prices (good for oil producers!), unrest in the middle east (good for defense!), so surely we can rally on increased inflation pressure today (uh....good for banks?) $SPY $QQQ
7460 2018-05-10 12:22:35 The argument that Alberta pays for the rest of Canada is a lost argument, how much have they actually supplied.  How much more does the tourism industry bring in as opposed to oil, look that one up. We need to change, period.
7461 2018-05-10 12:22:34 @RSL_Studio #24hnbr ADAC ticker reports oil on track in Eschbach.

7463 2018-05-10 12:22:31 We don't hardly get any oil from Iran at all zero

7467 2018-05-10 12:22:22 It’s close mined people like you that have no clue as to how things work in the world 30 years experience working at a Refinery tells me that we are in need of a better way and oil is certainly NOT it.  Good luck with your view.
7468 2018-05-10 12:22:16 It should be illegal to trade oil futures unless you have storage equivalence.  Keep Wall Street from profiteering.
7469 2018-05-10 12:22:12 Oil prices rise and auto sales are going down. People can’t do both. trump is getting ready to send the auto market in downward spiral. In trumps mind if he didn’t negotiate the deal it’s not a good deal. This is who you people put in office.
7470 2018-05-10 12:22:09 Don't disagree. Hope it reinvigorates shale oil exploration domestically which began to slow when crude price dropped. Hopefully, that happens & the US grows less dependent on the  unstable Middle East.
7471 2018-05-10 12:22:08 You may think CNN is a joke but oil prices are rising that is fact. That is what happens when Republicans cause wars in the Middle East. Inflation will be on the rise.
7472 2018-05-10 12:21:51 hmmm oil? just a drop or two & use it to remove? it’ll keep them soft too!
7473 2018-05-10 12:21:36 Not true. The gas prices were going up regardless. The oil industry has been in a historic 3 year recession. It was a matter of time before gas prices started going back up. CNN doesn’t want to mention that.
7474 2018-05-10 12:21:34 before you blindly jump on the Hemp train because "drug addicted America" loves to be under the influence of something, check out the medical evidence.....so far, the evidence is not clear on this "snake oil" touted as a "miracle cure" of everything!
7475 2018-05-10 12:21:25 Those are the people who fight the wars. We are are the backbone of the world. You people are pathetic and Europe is being conquered. By 2050 refugees will be the majority and Europe will be like Saudi Arabia oppression minus the oil wealth. Good luck. Eff off!

7480 2018-05-10 12:21:03 A smart way to deal with #Irandael :

Reimpose oil sanctions

AND

Wait for other sectors like finance, shipping, insurance until July. A step-by-step removal of sanctions as waiver deadlines fall.

7484 2018-05-10 12:20:39 Got an oil change and was hit on the entire time and when I was about to leave asked out for coffee..awkward.. I’m already interest in someone
7485 2018-05-10 12:20:35 The cost of renewable energy technologies has dropped by 80% in the past 10 years and will only drop further.  At the same time, the price of oil has been falling - by up to 70%, and with the global shift towards renewables  this downward trend will likely continue.
7486 2018-05-10 12:20:09 How will the surge in oil prices affect inflation metrics?  “Not very much” and “not for very long", at least in the most likely case.

7488 2018-05-10 12:20:01 It beats me as to why my hometown people of Keta are protesting against a chance of an economic oil boom. They should rather negotiate and hold the oil company to their obligations to the environment.

7491 2018-05-10 12:19:47 Yes. Now Rosneft is benefitting from higher oil prices d/t canceling the Iran deal, while trump makes a worse deal with NK (proving that pulling out of the Iran deal was never about the "art of the deal" at all)

7496 2018-05-10 12:19:29 I disagree. They're not complacent. They're corrupt. They're greedy. They're bought and paid for by special interest groups. They're bought by Russian money, Chinese money, big pharma, oil lobby. Not complacent, criminals, grifters, corruption, greed the face of the @GOP
7497 2018-05-10 12:19:25 This isn’t good. With prices rising for not just oil but gas as well, I’m glad i use the public transportation to get somewhere. For anyone who does a lot of traveling and uses a vehicle that uses a lot of oil or gas, I’d encourage you to get an electric car, or public transport.

7499 2018-05-10 12:19:05 And #cult45 likes paying more for Russian oil. Trump is making Russia strong at our expense.
7500 2018-05-10 12:18:59 How are you even possible? It's clinically fascinating that a human brain could be utterly irrational.

The Euros love the current agreement because they can sell Iranian oil. Who care if it entrenches the Mullahs and condemns the people of Iran to a lifetime of oppression?

7505 2018-05-10 12:18:43 Great for Russia too. Their economy was in the tank and now is getting a boost from high oil prices.
7506 2018-05-10 12:18:42 Australia is an island nation that depends heavily on imported fuel and our stockpile is critically low. We have just 22 days' worth of crude oil, 59 days of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), 20 days of petrol, 19 days of aviation fuel, and 21 days of diesel in reserve. #msm #auspol

7510 2018-05-10 12:18:22 I doubt Israel would ever target Europe.  Iran would.  I also think Iran would target your sources of oil, like Saudi Arabia.

7617 2018-05-10 12:06:58 This is one of the political ploy of the WH oligarch with regards to Iran's  impact on oil since the agreement. There is an oil war going-on in the Middle-east & the concern for higher gains of western investors aligned with this president
7618 2018-05-10 12:06:58 So, by pulling out of #IranDeal #trump is deliberately raising oil prices FOR #Putin & #Rosneft ? This helps secure #Putin’s hold on #Russia. Way to #MAGA by raising living costs for #Americans @realDonaldTrump

7633 2018-05-10 12:05:27 Is there a really huge jump in prices? The only items affected should be the sugary beverages, liquor and oil. Oil price, however, is hit more by the rising global prices, not by TRAIN. So, it is not right to ascribe the inflation totally to TRAIN.

7651 2018-05-10 12:03:43 Gas prices are going up for the same reason they always do OPEC is producing less oil. Supply and demand. Has nothing to do with Trump policies. Also the higher prices per barrel allow oil companies to expand and hire new workers. Don’t forget about the extra taxes libs put ongas

7663 2018-05-10 12:02:45 Trump didn't do that. OPEC did. And if you cared then maybe you should lobby states to allow offshore oil drilling. Its just like prisons- Everyone wants them but no one wants them built in THEIR backyard.

7665 2018-05-10 12:02:36 If Trump’s Strategy is to bring Iran to its knees through sanctions, will be tough to accomplish without the EU.  Bush and Obama both found that EU financial and oil sanctions were critical in leveraging Iran.  Trump+Bolton should remember that allies really matter.
7666 2018-05-10 12:02:31 I can almost guarantee this entire thing was made up by Israel.  Soon they will need our help to fight this fake war. Then 10trillion dollars later and hundreds of thousands dead some oil baron will get another few billion in revenue.
7667 2018-05-10 12:02:31 Economy is doing great, but my worry is the bad part of the Iran deal. Read several informed articles about how this will manipulate the oil markets. No matter how you slice it, greatly increased energy costs are coming to America. Could threaten all of this growth.

7709 2018-05-10 11:59:30 Gas prices will be rising because of us pulling out of the poorly written Iran agreement. We all need to make sacrifices to protect our interests.  Our friends in Russia will get some relief as they will prosper from rising oil prices. #maga

7735 2018-05-10 11:57:57 Great. Well there goes the extra $3 a week I was getting in my check since his big tax break. Gas will cost me about $8 a week more now since the stock market now had a reason to raise oil prices

7745 2018-05-10 11:56:43 It is so ridiculous we don't do more with solar. In the 80s I lived in a passive solar house at 7000 ft elevation in #Arizona We had many winter days where no other heat source was needed. Big oil & gas shut down progress.
7746 2018-05-10 11:56:33 i used olive oil which worked really well. i put a hot pot of water hung my face over it to loosen them then did the oil on a cotton ball.
7747 2018-05-10 11:56:31 There are far bigger issues involved here than oil. India is the fourth largest importer of Iranian oil after China, the EU and Japan.
7748 2018-05-10 11:56:27 @cenkuygur Why would Russia not want Trump to pull out of the Iran treaty?   It makes Iran more dependent on Russia.  It raises value of Russian oil.  It weakens US and European relations.   Putin wins on all fronts.

7756 2018-05-10 11:55:42 Gas prices have fluctuated since OPEC was started, your party wants to stop pumping oil and gas here, what do you think that will accomplish? If you did not get a tax break, you either don't pay enough or are in a very high bracket. Health ins has sucked since Obamacare.

7763 2018-05-10 11:55:28 A FEW THINGS HERE:

“For best TEXTURE” not that it will go bad if it’s not cold.
Plus the oil will separate slower if it’s cold OR wouldn’t separate at all if you didn’t buy “all natural” bullshit

Best texture. You know what gives the best texture? EMULSIFIERS

7776 2018-05-10 11:54:38 Oil prices going up 50% due to Trump's policies means gas prices are already heading to $3.65/gallon from $2.40: an additional $700/yr expense per average household.

Canceling out the entire #TaxCutsandJobsAct gain per the average household.

But the GOP doesn't talk about this.
7777 2018-05-10 11:54:34 Such hubris!  What happens when the rest of the world decides some other currency is appropriate for buying & selling oil?  @cspanwj

7779 2018-05-10 11:54:30 There are still people in Scotland who believe that the oil has run out.That message was driven home very well in 2014 and they don't read anything but unionist papers.The oil is going to last till the union is dissolved or indyref2, whichever comes first, then it's gone again!

7878 2018-05-10 11:43:35 I've been thinking about the 'flying hypocrisy' argument recently, since it links with scholarship in my discipline on tu quoque ad hominems. So this is a true question, not an attack: can oil companies claim 'intangibles' too?

7929 2018-05-10 11:36:20 I believe a big part of the problem is our voting habits
Too many people vote based on the economy (I do not)
That's where the trouble begins
Politicians then see creating jobs as the only way to keep their jobs
The low hanging fruit of big oil will always come into play

8014 2018-05-10 11:24:44 It's the wrong type of oil we have, so good old English gov get rid of it for us,bless them.
8015 2018-05-10 11:24:41 Who had a deal wirh Saddam Hussein to push for lighter sanctions in return for a lower oil price, remember? (not Britain though)

What gets Irn Bru stains out?
Depends who's asking.
If it was Trump I'd say crude oil.
8019 2018-05-10 11:23:38 Are you pissed off that No one Drinks as Much Fish Oil CapsulesAnd does Not have Experiences.
8020 2018-05-10 11:23:37 Agreed..Politicians need to b carefull now not to pour water on "oil of ppl's ANGER" and panic.Tired to listen to,their party politics.Ppl r suffering,are  tired,fearfull and in need of urgent SOLUTIONS.
8021 2018-05-10 11:23:32 Coconut oil!
8022 2018-05-10 11:23:30 Billions are Iranian people's money being frozen, nor Iranian hardliners nor the US want that for Iranian people. Don't worry! Billions are washed to American banks from Mullas and revolutionary guards' families controlling the oil, that's how sanctions help the US and damage ppl

8026 2018-05-10 11:22:42 Rahul Gandhi is still saying oil prices are falling all over the world. Has anyone bothered to fact check him? No but nehru met bhagat Singh will be fact checked
8027 2018-05-10 11:22:21 Time to crank up US production and push the oil & gas prices back down...maybe an executive order ; )
8028 2018-05-10 11:22:10 kitne kwab dek ta hai. teri behen ki le raha tha aur tu hi to oil laga kr deraha tha saale bhul gaya
8029 2018-05-10 11:22:04 Again, you're quite correct, and this is one major reason why I'm unconvinced by the Hydrogen option. Presumably it would be rolled out through the existing network of petrol outlets and be subject to the same resistance and delaying tactics from Big Oil as unleaded was.
8030 2018-05-10 11:21:57 There you go. Some honesty. Of course the export policy is good for you. You are personally benefitting from it. That doesn't mean it is good for America as a whole.  Do people in the oil industry mind high gas prices?  Of course not, you guys love them.

8034 2018-05-10 11:21:42 Higher oil prices will give Carney some smoke & mirrors to avoid raising rates. He always finds reasons to cut and excuses to not hike. He will only hike if he is trapped & his hand is forced. Even then he now has spotify playlists to fall back on...

8038 2018-05-10 11:21:23 Good luck with your wind farms on the moon 
There are too many stubborn morons in government looking after the oil and coal corporations, and perhaps getting paybacks for it.

8041 2018-05-10 11:21:05 How #IranDeal scandal is going to benefit Pak?

US 'll loose its ties with New Delhi because Iran being India's 3rd largest oil exporter and increasingly economic partner 'll remain distant from further indian invest. Iran will join CPEC & could seek eco-partnesrship with Pak!
8042 2018-05-10 11:21:00 I’ve tried local honey, hibiscus oil, ginger crystals and lots of lemon in my tea

8044 2018-05-10 11:20:56 I'm an ABC girl. Anything But Chardonnay!!! Tastes like olive oil to me. I hate any white wines that are aged in oak & look yellow. Like my whites to be fresh, crisp, lemony & fairly dry. When it comes to reds I'm very easy!!!

8045 2018-05-10 11:20:54 Ah yeah I always forget about bio oil! I should’ve started using it before really , thank you! And I know man it’s sooo crazy 
8046 2018-05-10 11:20:52 Good morning! Gas prices are up and it’s hurting my bottom line but I notice your corrupt oil cronies are doing great!
8047 2018-05-10 11:20:51 1-hezbullah arent actually terrorists u should know what ur talking about, they are  not preventing the pot from boiling over, they sre throwing oil on fire
8048 2018-05-10 11:20:40 The fuel prices would have been around Rs 100 - 120by reducing the ED a bit. Besides, USD was <Rs 50 for most of their tenure (@Rs 65+ now). Instead they chose to bleed the oil mktg cos. by subsidising it heavily, thereby screwing the economy.
8049 2018-05-10 11:20:22 The white Bommarito sponsor on the white back looks really clean  good luck this weekend

8051 2018-05-10 11:20:13 You got 3 people home who don't speak English. In return you have caused the situation in the ME to escalate. The price of oil is going to go through the roof and Saudi Arabia are going to get nuclear weapons. And all because you're obsessed with PRESIDENT Obama.
8052 2018-05-10 11:20:00 Looking ahead to today, traders will be paying attention to the release of the US CPI data at 14:30 (GMT+2). At the moment it is very remarkable that in spite of all this oil, the yield on the 10-year US bond has fallen below 3% again. Right now at 2.975%.
8053 2018-05-10 11:19:52 It’s exactly why they remove the horses. Ranchers, oil companies, & other resource stealing industries lobby to have the horses removed & now m kill buyers are lobbying to get the rights to ship the horses to Mexico. Mustangs were a protected animal until $$$ became the BLM goal
8054 2018-05-10 11:19:43 What would happen if all of America's oil went into a sovereign wealth fund and used to make the lives better of all Americans not just a few?
8055 2018-05-10 11:19:42 Read HFIR research...  But OK,  you are most welcome to believe CNBC and Gartman who predicted oil in the 40's right now...  (my oil investment are up 300% since 2016.... Not too bad for a clueless)

8062 2018-05-10 11:17:40 .@SABIC is seeking to buy about half of the $4.6-billion Oil and Natural Gas Corp. @ONGC_  backed India’s biggest petrochemical plant, Reuters reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. “They want to have a significant stake in ONGC Petro Additions Ltd (OPaL), around 50%
8063 2018-05-10 11:17:14 Trump is a cutout of Putin's global agenda... Putin is of course as result of his owning earths largest remaining oil bonanzas also puppeteer to Koch's and the other handful oil barons poised to complete PNAC Think Iran's missle attack on Israel at this moment was a coincidence?
8064 2018-05-10 11:17:05 Imagine 24 billion for an EFCC office complex...Nigeria we hail thee. That can build 24 factories of medium capacity employing 50 to 100 people each. No wahala ...make una continue...

8076 2018-05-10 11:15:16 This will never happen.. when thr crude oil prices crash(decrease)  you guys will change the formula or get rid of it so price will remain the same and you guya can profit from it. Yourll have done nothing in favour of the people but your pockets.

8078 2018-05-10 11:14:51 It’s also VERY convienient that the media and politics seem to brush over the fact that the Golan Heights are illegal occupied by Israel... but of course, there’s oil there isn’t there? #israel #syria #iran

8088 2018-05-10 11:13:19 Please explain sustainable palm oil because from what I see, there is no such thing. You should look at that poor orangutan climbing a tree whilst it is being felled and another with 100 bullet holesyou can make biscuits without it!
8089 2018-05-10 11:13:13 For soft silky hair, massage strands with coconut oil 2-3 times a week!
8090 2018-05-10 11:13:11 More "indirect", given the many other variables at work.  "Direct" would be Putin's enrichment on rising oil prices due to Trump violating Iran Deal.

8093 2018-05-10 11:12:48 Thank you for this, look forward to reading! Yes, of course blockchain too (am following this for my palm oil research). Your reply very helpful as I had been thinking of this as Tory/elite hubris (cavalier lack of interest in infrastructural detail), but much wider phenomenon
8094 2018-05-10 11:12:43 I remember giving a presentation in January 2016 when crude oil price was below $30 and there was gloom in China’s economy. Iran had just been freed from economic sanctions the year before. US shale oil was pumping too! 

No one saw oil at over $70 today.
8095 2018-05-10 11:12:25 I like spaghetti the next day better, the pasta is able to absorb the sauce a tad... try this, mince up some garlic and sauté it in a couple of tablespoons of olive oil and then fry your pasta up in that, it is so good... (Tip brought to you by the Letter “W”)
8096 2018-05-10 11:12:13 It’s very complex - Syria has been partnered with Russia’s oil & gas sales in Europe. Q-T pipeline would cut that European market share. Putin sided w/Assad to control the oil fields and pipelines.

8111 2018-05-10 11:09:29 True but it troubles me that our money still goes to places it shouldn’t bc of their efforts primarily from big business inc. big oil, then more $ to foreign govts like. Egypt or Israel than IMO don’t warrant it

8144 2018-05-10 11:04:58 I LITERALLY just said "given that they've cut all their inflation forecasts, they clearly don't buy into the '$100 oil' scenario!" 
8145 2018-05-10 11:04:30 Some love stories are no different to oil and water mixtures. Maybe I should just call it fire and water.  Sometimes the time spent apart tells the truth about who can't live without the other. Can't get. Married to a relationship which spend three months apart.  That's too evil
8146 2018-05-10 11:04:22 And right away we see the effects from #Trump tearing up the #IranNuclearDeal

Rockets flying from Iran and oil prices rising

8154 2018-05-10 11:03:31 Today our commerce secretary said that what Mr Trump has done it will never affect India in an interview to Indian express. Iran is the third largest exporter of oil to India. Some problem may be faced due to acute shortage supply for short time . Now we need to balance with Iran

8158 2018-05-10 11:03:12 Olive oil is good for cooking but it’s expensive and it has a stronger flavour than other oils. That makes it good for some things (e.g. aubergines / eggplants in my opinion) but not for others.

8186 2018-05-10 10:58:29 Very good analysis from @FT @valentinaromei @KathrinHille of challenges to #Putin in achieving targets he set for 'final' term in office. Higher oil prices might give him more money to invest; but they increase temptation to postpone reforms that might be politically risky.

8197 2018-05-10 10:56:35 Or Oklahoma, which wasted a perfectly good oil boom.  Or Louisiana, which is still trying to recover from Jindal.  Or Alabama, which is at the lowest on almost every metric & rife with corruption.

8234 2018-05-10 10:51:21 Before we started mining the oilsands, the oil used to pool on the ground, and flow overland into streams and rivers.

8268 2018-05-10 10:47:42 Well, It looks like that extra $20.00 a week ppl got back from their tax cut is going into the oil companies pockets with higher gas prices on their way.

8269 2018-05-10 10:47:28 Given the sudden oil rise past $70, Kenya could get lucky as it begins export from the Turkana oilfields. I hear break-even is around $80+ so if President Trump keeps up his  @tullow & GoK will be pleased. What do you think, fortuitous? @nderi_j @coldtusker @Anzetse
8270 2018-05-10 10:47:17 So, do you think the crude oil advance is not related to Iran deal? Just asking. BTW the 4% rise of $XOM and 2.5% in $CVX this week do not affect $DJI and markets? Are those unrelated to Iran deal? Maybe you are right but maybe not.

8407 2018-05-10 10:27:17 Wash them once in a while with dawn dish soap. Hang gloves upside down do the opening is on the bottom. When dry, treat them with Silicon lube or oil and store them in a large ziplock bag.
8408 2018-05-10 10:27:10 she's walking to Fort Mac or using pedal power?  Tickets sold to people whose wages are directly linked to oil sands. I would be getting my money refunded.
8409 2018-05-10 10:26:53 Yes, a waterspray with a few drops of essential oil would be great 
8410 2018-05-10 10:26:52 Yea it's not true and you shouldn't believe #israellies . Last time we lost thousands of innocent American men dying on half made oil fields. #Israel #syria #iraq #Netanyahu
8411 2018-05-10 10:26:49 Coming from the person who has failed to present a single shred of evidence to counter the argument about KSA's massive oil problem?
8412 2018-05-10 10:26:37 Consumers can vote with their wallet by choosing products that contain sustainable palm oil and ultimately show companies that this is the only type of palm oil consumers want to see in the products they buy. 2/2

8415 2018-05-10 10:26:05 Belive me I have memories of having my face washed in the car and it wasn't particularly nice but wet wipes are pointless. Maybe some sort of essential oil might help.  Lavender?

8418 2018-05-10 10:25:10 You then blundered by sayin it was “everything” to do with oil, meaning no other problems. You are now doing switch and bait to avoid admitting your reading and writing errors. Weak.

8420 2018-05-10 10:24:33 I have an aromatherapy essential oil diffuser. You can get good ones for cheap on amazon. Put some lavender up in that bitch and it’s lights out for me buddy
8421 2018-05-10 10:24:02 Iran bombs Israel. Oil prices soaring. N Korea releases prisoners... but the media wants a porn star’s atty to be the lead story on Russian money paid to Trump atty. Who cares anymore?

8427 2018-05-10 10:22:56 Same amount of people died in Pearl Harbor as September 11. Pearl Harbor gave USA reason to join WW2 n drop nuke. 9/11 gave USA reason to change amendment n "invade" Iraq for oil
8428 2018-05-10 10:22:38 Are you serious ? The right food / diet already does this. Haven't used toothpaste / toothbrush 3 yrs now, after 2 major, 2 minor painful toothaches started, using the oil pulling / remineralizing diet ( keto ) approach. Am as surprised as anybody else is.
8429 2018-05-10 10:22:33 Treat CN as a cold war enemy, avoid shooting at them the best we can. But, we do our best to weaken & dmg them, increase their costs, crash their economy, raise oil price, create unemployment, cause discontent. Above all, stop trading w CN to defund PLA build up

8431 2018-05-10 10:22:06 I had been involved in interpreting images and looking for detail in them: is it some element of interest or is it noise. This is a problem that is common. Today I am seeing images that remind me of my work in eye scanning but these are from the oil sector.
8432 2018-05-10 10:22:00 The idea of shale light crude oil replacing Iranian medium/heavy crude barrels in refineries is like telling a Truck driver to use gasoline because the gas station has run out of diesel.

 #OOTT
8433 2018-05-10 10:21:51 So nothing on ending oil exploration or family care package. Are they just lies?
8434 2018-05-10 10:21:50 A la Iraq strategy ! Olelo, oil oil oil !
8435 2018-05-10 10:21:45 Russia wants to get his hands on Middle Eastern Oil any way he can.  Israel wants to start a war in the Middle East, but they don't want to fight it.  They want Big Brother USA to do it for them.  So we have forces pushing Trump, and he listens, no considerations of higher prices
8436 2018-05-10 10:21:38 Thank you gov for increasing oil prices.. wt a great news .. we are waiting for 2020   #fb
8437 2018-05-10 10:21:37 At the forefront of the land grab, no shock that murdoch & rothschild sit on the boards of the oil companies,watch documentary PLANET OIL to see how dirty everyone's hands are, and genocide & regime change is at the very front of policy, they don't care how many dead Arabs

8444 2018-05-10 10:20:58 Happy Thursday! Asian markets closed up, European trading is mixed, futures & crude oil are up. Good open coming(?)
8445 2018-05-10 10:20:58 WHO BLOCKED IT 8+Years? OBAMA, Demo’s and Radical JUDGES & bureaucrats!                                   “N. America has hit an infrastructure crunch. There are not YET enough pipelines to keep pace with shale oil output from the Permian Basin of West Texas.”-UK Telegraph report
8446 2018-05-10 10:20:41 Russian oil is watered down. Shale is so crushing the market. Why else is Putin pulling a version of lebensraum?

8448 2018-05-10 10:20:21 @guardian Get your facts straight, The Golan heights belongs to Syria and illegally occupied by Israel. I guess Israel has done enough land grab, now wants to grab 
an oil field.

8452 2018-05-10 10:20:00 Tonight Iran has attacked Israel with 20 missiles and these have responded by attacking Iran's military positions in Syria, which already brings oil to almost $72 a barrel.
8453 2018-05-10 10:19:41 But we are happy to do business with Iran, to keep oil prices down and look the other way as they build ballistic weapons. Boris is so unsuitable for the job it’s eye watering

8457 2018-05-10 10:19:04 Oh & it's a lie with have more oil than Norway & as for the gas, much of it is in the Southern sector of UKCS.
8458 2018-05-10 10:18:54 Bro @jho_low, am trying to get in touch with Paris Hilton. Can PM me her contact please? Btw, looks like oil subsidies coming back, best time to drop by if you wanna refill your yacht. Let me know. #GE14 #GE14Malaysia #Malaysia
8459 2018-05-10 10:18:31 Diesel and heating oil mainly. Middle distillates expected to grow as economies continue to grow and with IMO regulations coming in 2020. Prices is good to watch heating oil vs gasoline on the Nymex
8460 2018-05-10 10:18:20 The cost of Russian oil is $ 12.
The cost price of US oil is more than $ 30.
8461 2018-05-10 10:17:59 With regards to the Middle East, there is a verifiable grab for total domination of what oil is left, had this conversation 20+ years ago as oil became scarcer. There is a concerted agenda with the US UK France asserting themselves with their power brokers Saudis & Israel
8462 2018-05-10 10:17:27 You brought KSA into this thread from nowhere, talk about KSA as an expert but don’t know it’s economic relationship to US, military/war/terror issues, not to mention lack of personal freedoms, but you call it a free market economy? And Norway does not rely so heavily on oil now.

8465 2018-05-10 10:16:39 I love spending my time oil pulling.

8468 2018-05-10 10:16:09 The Saudis are in the process of lauching the largest ever public offering of the State owned oil company Aramco. It makes perfect sense for them to have a higher oil price ahead of the IPO.

8471 2018-05-10 10:15:49 Oil soars as Trump revoked Iran nuclear deal. Brent crude futures jumped as much as 2.8% to a 3.5 year high of $77.20 West Texas crude is now $71.17 hope FG will utilize d gains of oil price to fix infrastructure & not be like their cousin who failed to fix infrastructure

8498 2018-05-10 10:12:30 I agree. I said elsewhere that the geopolitical reasons alone should be reason enough to stop going after the oil for example. My problem lies with unsophisticated people that spew out nonsense they can’t prove simply because it suits their political conviction
8499 2018-05-10 10:12:29 International terrorists that poison ex-spies? Or tried to invade the Republic of Georgia? Invaded Ukraine? Russia's GDP is less than that of California. Oil prices are dropping. Russian people are angry at your government, not the U.S. or Israel.

8530 2018-05-10 10:09:12 Oil prices are at extremely high levels and as a result, oil importing nations are going to bleed ; now that The U.S successfully removed Iran from the oil supply grind, how do you  @realDonaldTrump plan on insuring that oil prices are contained from further appreciation?

8532 2018-05-10 10:08:49 PS American sanctions are designed to stop the Iranian people developing atomic energy sufficient to allow 100% energy. The Iranian people could then sell 100% of its oil stocks to the world. The premise of Iranian nuclear weapons is deception by intent to conceal the real agenda

8548 2018-05-10 10:06:07 Okay listening to Midnight Oil's first album, their sound was really ahead of the time. Unless Aussie music was just more like 1980s alt rock in general in the late 70s

8556 2018-05-10 10:04:43 The oil sands have provided the whole country with thousands of jobs, bought $billlions of Canadian goods, hired Canadian companies, produced advancements in science and technology, given governments $billions in taxes, royalties, income taxes, wealth transfers. Wake up world.

8559 2018-05-10 10:04:05 Oil is a supply commodity that spikes in price due to oil traders, not oil to be refined.

This is a win for domestic producers.

8567 2018-05-10 10:03:12 'Heels'. Lots of nation states have oil and do not manage their economies well. Scotland is a big enough one to survive as an independent entity. The world is changing and the fact of the oil price falling is a warning not to rely on it.
8568 2018-05-10 10:03:03 It's an executive agreement, not a treaty, so he can do it as he wants.

I'm betting shooting rockets into Israel wasn't allowed under the plan, but here we are.

Saddam wasn't supposed to have cool guy weapons, but remember oil for food?

Yeah, give Iran billions and trust them?
8569 2018-05-10 10:02:53 No the poor certainly don’t, everything that’s good for yourself and the environment is expensive. On a positive note I’ve found a bar of shampoo which has no palm oil, last as long as 3 bottles of shampoo and no plastic waste. Iceland frozen food is stepping up to no palm oil 2

8671 2018-05-10 09:45:45 I read that Bush had a plan to regime change 7 countries in the region. Presumably they were not selling oil in petro dollars. Presumably because if this gained traction the US would be economically destroyed. City of London as well hence our special relationship.
8672 2018-05-10 09:45:40 You're also confusing yourself as to the use of 'fracking', not all UCOG sites need to be 'fracked'. The Weald Basin is a big find but when test drilling near Gatwick Airport the oil was free flowing.

8677 2018-05-10 09:44:37 The contingency plan is the billions they have saved away from oil sales plus the other oil money they invested in other important infrastructure. And they have less oil than Scotland/UK. But what does Scotland/UK have to show from past/current oil sales for the future?

8681 2018-05-10 09:43:59 1) They already are part of a big union which is positive at things they all agree on. Like getting the Euro to become a lead currency (the OPEC already thought about accepting payments for oil in Euro, which was a big blow to the US).
8682 2018-05-10 09:43:52 They are going to invade Iran.

Iran hasn't been at war with the west.
Iran has no Rothschild bank.
Iran has oil.
Iran says f*** the US dollar.

They are going to invade Iran.

Who are they? Fuctifano!

8685 2018-05-10 09:43:31 Britain remains and island made of coal..but it is now very likely most will never , ever be mined.  This could be the fate of some of the oil as well..but max poss reserve numbers are always used by Nats..longest run predictions, even where the industry accept they're outliers.
8686 2018-05-10 09:43:31 Peter Bone has a selective memory as lots of Brexit fanatics sold it as We're not asking anyone to leave the single market.Snake oil salesman is absolutely right.

8689 2018-05-10 09:43:02 @LinusTech I have an idea for the radiator issue.  Re-purpose a portable oil radiator.  Drill holes for input-output, put a pump on both.  You should get better thermals dispersal and less gunk.
8690 2018-05-10 09:43:00 Yesterday Wall Street closed positively. Trump's decision to reinstate Iran's sanctions led to a very sharp rise in oil prices, which will undoubtedly raise inflation, tighten interest rates and complicate the lives of many sectors.

8699 2018-05-10 09:41:29 The complexity of (one e.g. only) having to already give tax breaks (ie reduce the tax income from oil,) to keep people exploring and then producing..because decommissioning costs would other wise stop them...in an area where prices will vary all the time..is simply ignored
8700 2018-05-10 09:41:10 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
8701 2018-05-10 09:41:10 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

8703 2018-05-10 09:41:03 Norway did just fine before the oil. And they have invested wisely. The national oil and gas company, Statoil, is a world leader in alternative energy. They'll be fine.

8706 2018-05-10 09:40:11 What I don’t understand is the benefit to the UK in demonising Russia. When this happened in the UK in the run up to the Iraq war the aim was clear - control of the very lucrative oil supply in the region. What is the reasoning behind a propaganda war with Russia? Who benefits?
8707 2018-05-10 09:40:05 ahh you liked that! Oh Mr P. ...it's all waiting and waiting.
8708 2018-05-10 09:40:04 Don't you think it's time for us to put oil behind us? Most Libyans don't benefit from the oil. I am happy to argue that oil has been a source of oppression. Don't you think it's time for us to exceed oue budget goals with innovation and individual empowerment?
8709 2018-05-10 09:40:01 How much oil is there to 'liberate'?
Usual criteria ! 
8710 2018-05-10 09:39:37 It seems clear to me..#Trump criticism of OPEC was a smokescreen..oil prices rising by cutting off Iran oil benefits 1)Russia 2)Saudi Arabia..both are countries funneling money to Trump Organization through Cohen shell corps and “loans” to Kushner!Trump said”Pay to Play,illegal”!
8711 2018-05-10 09:39:32 Here we go...one rally on no fuckin volume and suddenly everyone’s a bull again. What changed yesterday that money came back in? Nothing. Interest rates are still going up. Trade war is still a possibility. Oil? Maybe. Horse manure? Guaranteed.

8718 2018-05-10 09:38:41 Green looks older. Wondering if those marks are oil? Like from a car? Except that the mark higher up looks more deliberate.
8719 2018-05-10 09:38:29 Global wars have been fought over oil, they will stop at nothing.
8720 2018-05-10 09:38:28 Haha
8721 2018-05-10 09:38:19 I absolutely agree...but it is a regular problem with Nationalist stats, disaggregating *profit* but not *costs*.  Another one is stating turnover, or Gross income, as *profit* or net accrual..so with oil one could drill every last battle out till the 2060s but make £10 doing it

8732 2018-05-10 09:37:06 That was a problem solved by regulation in the end. By governments saying, "All cars produced after X date must run on unleaded." Meaning oil companies were obliged to change just to stay in the game. You could do that with Hydrogen too, just not sure it's the elegant solution.

8749 2018-05-10 09:33:46 Too bad you don't remember that Iran had a democratically elected government until they were going to nationalize their oil. That is when the US government, at the behest of oil companies over threw that government and put in power the Shah. We are the reason Iran is this way.
8750 2018-05-10 09:33:46 barrel of crude oil is how much now?

8754 2018-05-10 09:33:01 Like many brexit supporters it will be others fault . They struggle own up to the fact they were duped by snake oil salesmen  and find it easier to believe the daily diet of lies by the gov and the media  than to face their own short comings

8756 2018-05-10 09:32:40 Requires a complementary payment architecture. Euro CBs are discussing clearing oil in € but that only works if no banks doing business in dollars are involved
8757 2018-05-10 09:32:19 After All , Iran Sanction may not be good for Crude Bulls at all. Cheaper Oil seller on the Market. Saudi committed to big brother take an action to keep oil price stable , and Russia will be more than happy to take his cut from Production increase.

8773 2018-05-10 09:28:27 It'll affect the whole world. Global oil supply is projected to fall by about 3-5% as a result of Iran being sanctioned. Doesn't sound like much, but there's not really much spare capacity as it is. So prices will go up basically until OPEC decides to release more oil...

8778 2018-05-10 09:27:43 Ironic that Scotland's GDP increased when oil prices were low. Hauliers had cheaper fuel, prices dropped, people bought more.

8801 2018-05-10 09:23:57 @realDonaldTrump My advice is to hold our shale oil as hedge against inflated oil price per barrel to help consumers at the pumps as our protection AND DO NOT SELL IT.  Stock up the sweet crude which makes refining much easier.  We should target a 10 year oil supply safety valve

8810 2018-05-10 09:22:48 problem with using oil in measurement for the UK is that it isn't significant until you boil it down to Scotlands stats. Then you have to factor in UK financial input as opposed to solely Scotlands and then the lines are all blurred as to the apportioned cost/tax/profit etc.

8816 2018-05-10 09:22:10 About water and oil sold at churches to be used. Take a trip to Dischem. They have oil, salt for tokoloshi and so forth. They sell Wheat Grass which we drink. Does it mean grass from Dischem is better than that from church or their holy oil is better than that from church????

8949 2018-05-10 08:59:20 MEDIA, trump has no interest in helping the USA with Iran. Money into trump hands by pulling out of the Iranian deal is astounding and astronomical.

8951 2018-05-10 08:59:06 You don’t emit any extra co2 or consume any extra oil in any of the options above, because they would be emitting and consuming the same amounts either way. With no regard for if you were on board or not.
8952 2018-05-10 08:59:00 Then ride a bike or carpool with someone who’s going to the same place as you anyway. Walk or take the bus. Change always start with one man, if you can change your habit and others then maybe we won’t need to consume so much oil.

8972 2018-05-10 08:55:24 The biggest thing we have to look forward to after jettisoning the Iran deal is rising oil prices. Get ready to kiss that tax break money goodbye. And who profits from higher gas prices? The Kochs, Russia, Saudi Arabia to name a few.

8976 2018-05-10 08:54:24 Not necessarily. It will mean that it’s now profitable for further domestic oil exploration and while that may put oil workers back in the field, our environment pays the price

Second, living in Texas, and also being in the oil and refinery business, I know we don't need Iranian oil. Bringing up Russia is an old song that normal people don't listen to.
9042 2018-05-10 08:41:27 The price of oil is spiking as a result of US sanctions being put back in place on Iran (a major oil exporter). Expect to be paying a lot more to fill your tank soon. A good time to switch to public transport, perhaps?

9070 2018-05-10 08:37:16 Even if things are labeled in inch, they often actually are metric. e.g. a 3.5" floppy is actually 9 cm (3,5" would be 8,89 cm). It looks like crude oil is traded in barrel at the stock market, but in fact, its actually traded in metric tons, if you buy or sell it in real life.

9086 2018-05-10 08:34:54 We'll take these down one at a time, gas is going up because of you Libs crying about climate change, making the oil companies make a summer blend, summer prices are always higher every year, and OPEC still controls prices. One down.

9115 2018-05-10 08:30:34 You definitely need something more healing than oil/moisture based at this point imo. Once the skin breaks it’ll need a helping hand to heal again - especially with the slow healing of EDS. It’ll take more than a few days sadly 
9116 2018-05-10 08:30:31 But global comparisons are perfectly possible now.  I can easily compare the prices of a PlayStation, or oil, or gold or blue-ray across the global.  the existence of a intl CPI doesn't help that. What actual real world problem does it solve?
9117 2018-05-10 08:30:25 It is sickening to hear a Governor of a non oil-producing state to state that salaries can't be paid because of oil price and production. How are you weaning your state?
9118 2018-05-10 08:30:14 So, @realDonaldTrump pulls out of #Iran deal. We enter the epoch of high #oil $OIL prices (again): nearest Brent $77.67 and growing. Main beneficiaries of growth are Russia and Saudi Arabia, and the #USA may finish developing its expensive fields. Forget about oil<$65
9119 2018-05-10 08:30:10 The Iraq War also proves my previous points about war. We didn’t keep the oil fields like people claim we were after, we gave them back to Iraq. We also didn’t stay in Iraq after defeating them, despite the claim we’re after world power through colonization. 2/2

9157 2018-05-10 08:20:57 From this chart, oil price took a dive around March 2014 and went to to its lowest around Jan 2016. It’s only logical to maintain the foreign reserve as at that time not deplete it.

9164 2018-05-10 08:19:51 You can file a claim with them. I worked at a JL as a teenager and saw the same thing happen to a customer. Well almost, they forgot to put the drain plug back so all the oil drained. I believe they ended up picking up like 50% of the cost at least. Definitely worth pursuing..
9165 2018-05-10 08:19:47 In the end it all comes down to oil again. Aggressively sanctioning or even attacking Irans petroleum industry seems highly dangerous.
9166 2018-05-10 08:19:41 ..and guess what, separatists will now be celebrating the fact that a war in the Middle East (yeah, I know, another one) could mean high oil prices. Who cares if people dying means we could afford Indy with oil at $100+ a barrel, I mean, priorities right...

9208 2018-05-10 08:12:37 Really? But you think the US have carte blanch to impose sanctions with super extensions detrimentally impact on EU businesses? All because you put a petulant child in the White House? Can’t you see he’s done this to raise oil prices for his puppet masters in Russia and Saudi?!
9209 2018-05-10 08:12:31 @ErikSTownsend Hi Erik, just watched your peak oil video 3 on your website. Watching it from 2018 i must say, is simply eerie. You have done an unbelievable job there with your calls. I was trying to download some of the white paper documents you had on the site but unable to?

9216 2018-05-10 08:11:29 Oil prices bounced back as investors digested President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the US from Iran’s nuclear deal. The price of Brent crude and WTI crude oil rose 3.2% and 3.0% to US$77/bbl and US$71/bbl respectively.

Putin was so happy, he even gave a green light for minor Israeli strikes.

9332 2018-05-10 07:48:15 ...also, Cohen got $500,000 from a Russian Oligarch'​, Victor Vekselberg, an oil & metals Billionaire & close associate of Putin, & is under sanctions by the U.S.or, "As Trump calls it 3 1/2 pornstars" S. Colbert 
 did it.  Fake News??? No!..
9333 2018-05-10 07:47:52 He needs oil prices to go up. He's very popular now, and that can go south easily if the economy stays crappy.  And all his petro-oligarch buds need oil prices up.
9334 2018-05-10 07:47:18 Corbyn and that idiot Owen Jones both praised Venezuela's 'socialism' for the very short time it was successful (when oil prices were high) then when it went tits up they dissowned it and deleted the comments they had made. Now it wasn't 'real socialism'.

9361 2018-05-10 07:42:07 Diesel from discarded vege oil would probably be much less, but there isn’t a lot of that to be had.
9362 2018-05-10 07:41:43 It’s been dead for years. Congress passed a law to allow US oil to be sold outside the US. But the protection side is still ongoing. I say good luck to the petro yuan. China has debt levels higher than the US.

9419 2018-05-10 07:31:09 I expect that the President will work with U.S. oil producers to increase output.  It is also possible that Saudi Arabia might increase outputs over and above OPEC ceilings.  At any rate, the U.S is not reliant on Iranian oil but will deal with a tightened global market.

9466 2018-05-10 07:24:29 Looking forward to seeing you in Fort McMurray, we aren't all concerned about your old concerns, even though your old concerns weren't even an oil sands concern. But some people are just concerned for the sake of being concerned. I too am concerned for them.

9473 2018-05-10 07:23:05 Furnace Oil is also referred to as Heavy Fuel Oil(HFO) or Fuel Oil.  It is now possible to generate electricity from any source of energy that can generate heat(Stirling cycle etc.).

9475 2018-05-10 07:22:07 The Iran sanctions will have a small effect on the US, but will be pretty big in Europe.  Fortunately the US oil companies didn't commit to Iranian oil in the same way Europe did.

I'd call that killing people to make more money on oil, distract voters, because you're arm-wrestled into it by an economically stronger partner, etc. Definitely not for moral reasons.

9601 2018-05-10 07:02:59 Why sell a land for $60,000 why ebi where dem discover oil for.
9602 2018-05-10 07:02:55 Chart chasers may get burned. The reason for the YTD selling remains firm. Global growth slowed & no data has changed that yet. There are enough inv who don't believe it to what higher oil/rates mean. Consumer spending tipped over globally on very gild debt.
9603 2018-05-10 07:02:41 Oil city ARE the biggest spenders in world football! Let's not detract from that
9604 2018-05-10 07:02:10 This is just another seed planted for manufacturing an excuse for war.  No different from when they proclaimed “Saddam has nuclear warheads!” just to invade Iraq.

I'm guessing stocks in oil companies or about to launch 'Trump Oil': the greasiest, crudest, most flammable, whitest oil

9751 2018-05-10 06:38:40 I have to disagree. It's not PepsiCo or Nestle that is buying the palm oil. IT IS US, the consumers! We can make a conscious decision not to buy products containing palm oil and this will show our disapproval of their practices. Less drama @GreenpeaceUK and more education.....
9752 2018-05-10 06:38:28 Regardless of country or century, it''s always about oil/resources/land. The people never matter.
9753 2018-05-10 06:38:22 Actually now is a fantastic time to do it. Oil is at $75. Best time ever. Hahaha.
9754 2018-05-10 06:38:16 'The main benefit of fracking is the financial benefit to the drillers.'

And the low prices for the gas/oil they produce. 

US fracking has broken the Middle East/OPEC cartel on oil.  No longer can oiligarchs hold the world to ransom.

9803 2018-05-10 06:31:19 Very much so. Poland is one of the few repeat buyers of shale in Europe and one trumpeted by shale. But the purchase really a political gesture than being anything else. Polish oil industry is still very much influenced by the government
9804 2018-05-10 06:31:10 It's oil... in sand... Deal with it.
9805 2018-05-10 06:31:05 Following US ripping up Iran deal, I see oil is up to $77, I expect the stories of how this burdensome resource wil soon run out to be just around the corner.
9806 2018-05-10 06:30:50 Never read any of that book before. Need to try find some reviews for it before buying. The author seems like they contradict themselves a lot in different chapters. Tell me, would I find it in fiction or non-fiction in the book shop?

9822 2018-05-10 06:28:20 'Oil sands' is a political propaganda term.  It's an attempt to make them seem more refined (they aren't) while 'tar sands' is nothing more than a word that describes the appearance. It's you who seems to have been sucked in by the politics.

9833 2018-05-10 06:27:17 Yep, those are the reports I've been seeing for a while now. Considering how much they're easing regs for oil cos, makes you wonder how prices are rising. I know it's a global market, but how can there be so much variation if not w/US crude prices getting jacked up too? Greed+.

9841 2018-05-10 06:26:05 This doesn't help the case for Indy-we spent the oil revenue and benefitted from a lower tax economy. You can't now go back in time and un-spend the money and make all different choices.

9842 2018-05-10 06:26:00 Renewables is the future, we can't remove all the oil and gas, I think we all know of the wealth produced for ukgov from scottish oil and gas. 80% of energy use in scot will be from renewables in 2020.

9847 2018-05-10 06:25:02 This is very surprising because Niger is landlocked, could it be a not-so-far-fetched-error? In the 2010 Niger coup, oil prices spiked for 24hours cos the Asian traders didn’t know the difference between Nigerien and Nigerian @AO1379

9850 2018-05-10 06:24:20 2016 isn't that old, and if your opinion is still that they are tar sands, then it's hypocritical of you to go there and take the money from ticket sales, that were generated by the OIL sands.
9851 2018-05-10 06:23:57 Anyway, you’re right - it’s massively more complex and reflects decades, perhaps a century of Western (all of them) interference in the ME, ranging from the Iranian Revolution, oil exploitation, creation of Israel, etc. There is no single cause now, just a Gordian knot of misery.

Overwhelming evidence has shown him to be incorrect in this old story he published 2 years ago.

9870 2018-05-10 06:20:37 Lol. But when you slander a community and then expect to sell tickets at venue in that community you better realize there will be some backlash. It is kinda stupid to bite the hand that feeds you. Alberta oil is more responsible than many other countries. Educate yourself.
9871 2018-05-10 06:20:30 Disagree. The stuff looks like tar, hence 'tar sands'.  'Oil sands' is purely a marketing term, nothing better than that. It's a term used to pretend the stuff is oil but it's not until heavily refined.  The oil is a finished product. The sands aren't actually oil.

9874 2018-05-10 06:20:25 It depends on the heat in which you cook I think.
I always think of virgin oil as salad oil for light cooking whereas coconut oil can be used for deep fry such as jackfruit chips or banana chips
for normal cooking, I prefer sesame oil but its availability is very restricted

9920 2018-05-10 06:14:42 Well as we all know, Trump withdrew USA from Iran nuclear deal. Big impact on oil market and will continue to influence oil. Impact limited outside oil
