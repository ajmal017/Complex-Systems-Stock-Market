2 2018-07-16 23:57:24 God damn, that is insane! FANG stocks have just been monsters. I agree that there HAS to be some balancing out, but I think the run goes a little further yet.. I see a bubble here though

6 2018-07-16 23:55:31 $NFLX will go down further tomorrow.
I don’t know if $NFLX can take down the whole stock market tomorrow,
but it can take down the FANG stocks for at least a day.

51 2018-07-16 23:35:06 So... when does the impeachment happen? And do we get to throw tomatoes? I'm not saying we should... But I've always been partial to stocks! Nice old fashioned humiliation! Especially for treasonous cunts like @realDonaldTrump #ImpeachTrump
52 2018-07-16 23:32:46 my bad i exaggerated on the time, but i intentionally excluding saying i won in the tweet because it was my full intention to lose the set until game 3 (thats why i was stalling when i was down three stocks to one both of the first two games)
53 2018-07-16 23:29:51 A public spanking?  A couple of days in the stocks?  Gee, there must be something.
54 2018-07-16 23:29:20 My 401k ain't fat by any means but eventually with rollovers and stocks going up if I stayed invested with what I have now I'd retire with 400k and I only make 25k a year so I'd be able to live pretty ok.
55 2018-07-16 23:28:17 Jim since AAPL and GOOG track closely have you considered any other stocks to add/diversify these picks?
56 2018-07-16 23:28:04 18/19 end stocks to use projected at 10.5%. Using University of Illinois model that puts avg price at 3.78. Dec at 3.55. Low but not that low. Also early harvest and old crop still in bin needing to move.
57 2018-07-16 23:26:10 Wow wow hold on. I preorder the LY Tear albums from taobao but they are not here yet. It has been a freaking 2 months and 5 days. They keep saying that the stocks were wrong and all. Did the company even know about their own taobao shop for being slow and everything?!?!
58 2018-07-16 23:24:17 #FANG $FANG Update for those interested. For members who like to day trade have been using any one (or all) of the FANG stocks to buy calls to take advantage of the USD/JPY FANG pump but selling every close knowing there is extreme downside risk as proven today after hours
59 2018-07-16 23:21:30 Wow, kudos for fighting off the bots. Plus Trump knows nothing about business. Wealth from his father and would've made more if he just sat on his property and stocks without doing anything. I mean he went bankrupt running a casino. Bankrupt running a FLIPPIN' casino!!

66 2018-07-16 23:14:49 My take: until Tillerson is in the clear from any Exxon oil and gas interests (stocks, dividends, retirement plans, etc), he'll probably stay quiet, since Exxon has deals with Russia. Sad.

69 2018-07-16 23:13:21 What about a general strike for those who can.  Not showing up for work.  Stopping the wheels of commerce, forcing their stocks to take a dive.  Would that get their attention? Real question.
70 2018-07-16 23:13:20 On his triumphant return expect Drumpf to attack the FAANG stocks because he loves kicking em when they are down. Also he is probably feeling pretty beat up after Putin made such a show of showing the world what a bitch 'the donald' actually is.

78 2018-07-16 23:02:43 good day for $IQ today; $huya is still trying to pass its resistant $39; both still stand strong. In the meantime, $NFLX ER after hour bringing stocks down...FANNG pay attention to it.$NFLX rising wedge pattern, no surprise that it goes down after hour
79 2018-07-16 23:02:09 Day to day movements of stocks are irrelevant most of the time. Even after earnings reports. Buy winners and let them ride. Like Ross does. Like I do. That’s how you make money.
80 2018-07-16 23:02:00 Said differently, I could define my interests increasingly broadly (stocks->finance->econ->soc sci) so as to always be learning & never need to do orig research. Instead I'm attracted to certain puzzles no one knows the answer to.  The specific puzzles are prob path dependent

87 2018-07-16 22:52:08 walmart usually stocks shelves in the evenings and will let you take boxes if you want free ones.  when we moved last year, i bought boxes on amazon because i'm neurotic and needed them all to be the same dimensions and they were affordable.
88 2018-07-16 22:51:56 Nah.. it was your buddy Obama and his crowd who sold us out.. What about your bestie Hillary signing away control of 20% of our uranium stocks to the Russians in exchange for a donation to the Clinton money laundering machine... aka Clinton Foundation...
89 2018-07-16 22:47:40 I covered my short and am thrilled. Now let’s see what the catalyst will be that makes the VXX go up and the market drop. Seems like the Fed keeps buying up bonds to keep rates artificially suppressed (any time rates try to rise like today) and force cash into stocks. Can’t last!

91 2018-07-16 22:47:00 Wow. That is the weakest statement possible without agreeing. Don't want to make Trump too mad, do you? I see you are still party before country. You don't have the intelligence communities back. BTW how is the ban on bump stocks you said you already did going?

It's friggin awesome, Totally changed my trading world. Its like I finally get it now and reduced my anxiety!
95 2018-07-16 22:45:08 Depends on your goals. I usually just invest in companies I believe in. I own stocks in apple and walmart, and gambled on therapueticsmd because of cnbc and gory burned but holding for after they release their product.
96 2018-07-16 22:42:54 It's not improving the lives of the middle class or the working class. Those folks don't own stocks; they are trying to survive the erosion of unions, health care, strong public schools and other intrinsic American institutions.
97 2018-07-16 22:42:48 Same with Chinese streaming stocks. Getting bitten more badly.
98 2018-07-16 22:42:06 @timothysykes Penny stocks does have the ability to make a trader to thinking adopt the market in a given sector. The good thing is there are always new lessons that can be disseminated. Long story short about this right now, is that I am currently wrong.

100 2018-07-16 22:39:25 so what happened is I ate a weed gummy so I was high and I thought it was funny that he was doing the shino stalling, I won game 1 then game 2 I went peach and fished for items, I had 3 stocks to his 1 and SD'd them at 30 seconds because I figured he was probably bored too (1/2)

i watched through something on youtube ($GOOGL) , w/ someone verbally annotating and responding to chats... 
i believe NFLX runs on $AMZN AWS...

i am so confused. but not about which stocks to buy.
108 2018-07-16 22:28:47 Since the AG refuses to charge/jail any democrat, why don't we settle for a weekend in stocks in central park?  Or tar and feathering?  Or how about a good old fashion branding?

115 2018-07-16 22:23:48 Oh no! You mean an American businessman owns a business?? 
Jackass, fact remains he donates his presidential salary. He's cut taxes, put money back in paychecks, lowest black unemployment in history, welfare recipients are down, GDP highest in 8 years, stocks up, the list goes on
116 2018-07-16 22:23:27 Hopefully by the end of October I will buy my first stock, going to be reading up on how to make the money in stocks. Need my money to keep growing #readup #StockMarket #investments #moremoneymoreproblems
117 2018-07-16 22:23:10 Also Tosin, I’ve begun to look at other markets outside the US. European stocks are better priced & more diversified. Then some emerging markets and then Japan are interesting too.
118 2018-07-16 22:22:15 That's a visual..although we are really trying to not do that any more. How about "Stocks"?
119 2018-07-16 22:21:01 that means only 4 or 5 stocks running all market , everything else squashed man

131 2018-07-16 22:13:14 You still alive bro? They got you on life support again? Get well soon and f*cking Retire!
132 2018-07-16 22:13:00 I must say this $CELZ is one of the few OTC stocks that I really LOVE. It is a money make. Long term and short term.
133 2018-07-16 22:12:29 You see often stocks pull back after a big run up even if they beat. And Netflix had a huge run and didn't beat all around (way short on sub growth). This is a legit sell off
134 2018-07-16 22:12:24 Along with the staling on shield change, Cloud is never killing with landing bair again

I really dont like this lol, stocks are going to last for ages in the new game if people dont have safe kill options.
135 2018-07-16 22:11:39 finally got around to topping up my car with adblue today - quite why dealers seem to believe you have to bring it in i dont know. Just another annoying fluid to top up / maintain stocks of. If you can top up washer fluid you can do adblue
136 2018-07-16 22:09:45 Like he gets nailed
137 2018-07-16 22:09:40 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
138 2018-07-16 22:09:11 About the stocks for Netflix ?
139 2018-07-16 22:08:16 Stocks in LinkedIn and FB just collapsed!!
140 2018-07-16 22:06:51 Netflix stocks drop- could it be people don’t like the idea that Obama is now involved with this company?
141 2018-07-16 22:06:03 Hope na ubos stocks ko dun sa isa kong outlet.
142 2018-07-16 22:04:53 No it's not, some research would tell you they're in a completely different league with #VRS way ahead. There's a reason #VRS is striking up deals left, right and center with major globals, china, US and strong links with government. Plenty of crap 'graphene' stocks out there.
143 2018-07-16 22:03:31 @abrawi all tech as we just saw, it’s the beginning indicator of how Er will go for stocks. That’s why everything dumped with NFLX
144 2018-07-16 22:03:24 She also received over $150 million from the hypocrites on Wall Street . Then Trump was elected and the hypocrites bought stocks and called it a “Trump Rally”  big business is full of !

146 2018-07-16 21:59:51 If I looked deeper, I could find out. The house could be in the trust. And it seems she has borrowed against it. This could be in addition to part of the trust they may already have. It could be the real property part of it. There could be accounts, stocks, real property...
147 2018-07-16 21:59:46 So how's your oil stocks doing ... Fk the planet as long as you have plenty of money for underground towns and escape rockets ... Some of us know that's what its all about
148 2018-07-16 21:58:48 I think you have a group of traders now not looking to win PB ad MB and see an undervalued or potential for the future player and see profit in price gains alone from penny stocks. A lot of people suggesting a mid priced player is usually just selling themselves
149 2018-07-16 21:58:34 So I guess I'm stuck with @netflix stocks after being stuck in a train and unable to trade it during a 13.5% drop after hours. Ugh!
150 2018-07-16 21:57:55 Did you notice they never discuss the Stocks on Trish’s show?

154 2018-07-16 21:56:35 Thks for setting the world straight with this Thomas. Although watching the left implode today has helped my anti depressant stocks. If trump wud have head-locked vlad, left wud have declared it human rights violation on trump.
155 2018-07-16 21:54:15 Feels like youre mixing stocks and flows? Progress (flow) did slow after you built the newer house. Its better than before,but now plataeud
156 2018-07-16 21:52:34 nothing says love like deciding what stocks to buy

But maybe I should just invest more in Nin•endo lol
157 2018-07-16 21:51:16 Will fox air the mods and stocks? If not pull some strings for us!!
158 2018-07-16 21:51:14 What else you can’t forget is the US admin trusting Lavrov on getting rid of Assad’s sarin stocks. That alone should have one of the most impacts to people regarding Russia’s Involvement in Syria.
159 2018-07-16 21:50:53 @MadMoneyOnCNBC X us steel. Looking like a incredible setup goin into earnings. No one talks about metal stocks but they can’t keep up with demand. Earnings obviously has been showing that qtr after qtr. 41-41$ pre earnings. Imo

166 2018-07-16 21:44:05 You do realize Jeff B. wealth is not coming from a monthly paycheck. His net worth is coming from his stocks that are gaining in value because he is efficient and has an amazing platform.
167 2018-07-16 21:43:30 Hey man,
Do you have any reference or courses I can take to learn the way you break down stocks? really impressive man
168 2018-07-16 21:40:48 Stocks
169 2018-07-16 21:40:05 Soon a merge with tdameritrade and coinbase. Soon ill buy and sell stocks with cryptos.
170 2018-07-16 21:40:04 Oh definitely not!! But it does come out of our supply closet that our supervisor stocks and I always feel bad using unnecessary supplies
171 2018-07-16 21:39:10 Day 126 without sex: I’m buying shitty stocks and cryptocurrencies so I can remember the feeling of something going down on me

173 2018-07-16 21:38:24 Every place you drive in michigan there is new construction sites , new roads, new businesses, new banks, stocks up, democrats bitch and aren't happy, but if we were not working and living on the streets because we lost our homes from bad loans ,then they seem to be happy.
174 2018-07-16 21:37:04 Most Likely!!  lol!
175 2018-07-16 21:36:11 I'd like to say that the addition of penny stocks and performance buzz have been brilliant and improved the platform. I would tweek the PB a little (dribbling) Matter of time before more growth in the product :)
176 2018-07-16 21:36:04 Walt Disney gave his housekeeper stocks every year for the holidays, and she died a multi-millionaire.
177 2018-07-16 21:35:56 their subscriber growth wasn't as high as expected, so now all tech stocks are feelin it
178 2018-07-16 21:34:57 Thanks man.. feels good.. been a lot more patient and these stocks have moved nicely.. been sizing well also
179 2018-07-16 21:34:55 the headlines that come post earnings. Tesla beats. . . every time . . . more important with this stock bc while all stocks are some part reality/fundamentals and some part narrative, $tsla is the exclusion that proves the rule- all narrative all the time.

186 2018-07-16 21:33:12 Well since @hmvtweets already stocks @BTS_twt albums I think there's a good @asda and @sainsburys would be interested to.
I mean #LoveYourself_Tear is still charting at HMV so it's clearly popular.
187 2018-07-16 21:32:50 Yes. Best first step is a US bank account. Then tell your bank you want to start investing in Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and they will point you in the right direction. For individual stocks I use an app called Robinhood but I don’t know if non-residents can use it.
188 2018-07-16 21:32:46 I'm blown away by people who defend billionaires because "their wealth is tied in stocks and assets, it's not liquid man!". Like, yeah dude. We know that. We know these people aren't literally Scrooge McDuck swimming in a silo of gold coins.
189 2018-07-16 21:32:18 Hi @Walmart hoping that you’ll have some stocks of @BTS_twt upcoming album to be release on Friday 8/24!

192 2018-07-16 21:31:49 Robinhood...I heard Acorn is good too but they charge a fee and you don’t get the option to buy individual stocks
193 2018-07-16 21:30:30 looks like obamas and jarrett gave netflix the kiss of death.......down 60+ after new subscriber numbers missed at earnings...taking down rest of the fang stocks
194 2018-07-16 21:30:04 As a businessman I made a fortune from Trump stocks. So only I can save us from Chinese stockholders and their DUMB stocks!
#MAGA
195 2018-07-16 21:30:01 You know $BTC is doing bad when all bitcoin peeps are now "value" investors and are bashing those on Twitter who say $AMZN $NFLX $TSLA are not value stocks. The fact that all these crypto kids are now value investors makes me realize we are probably in a bubble
196 2018-07-16 21:29:59 Senator Smith is he epitomizes what’s wrong with our government. She NEVER takes questions from the public, she is heavily conflicted with medical device stocks that she profits from when healthcare is more expensive. She proposed the land swap bill which enabled PolyMet
197 2018-07-16 21:29:34 Suggestion for @SEPTA: set up some stocks in Dilworth Park and put in whoever is responsible for the design of the steel fences and ticket gates at Suburban station. The line of people wanting throw rotten tomatoes and fish at that cretin will dwarf the Superbowl crowd...
198 2018-07-16 21:29:32 Want to start getting into US stocks, but gotta figure out how to do it from here OR open a US bank account
199 2018-07-16 21:29:11 Dang Wilf! You should be picking stocks! Keep up the great work. Keep asking guests tough questions and follow up probs! Love that! Reminds me of the great Mark Haines. God rest his sole. Great addition to @CNBCClosingBell @CNBC
200 2018-07-16 21:28:50 This is ONLY ABOUT THE MONEY for WINSTAR. That's why it's so hard to interest and keep new fans to racing. Throw in the George Soros however minor in the breeding stocks and unfortunately it just sucks. He'll be gone to China never to be seen again.
201 2018-07-16 21:28:50 Deep State was setting Trump up with that phony Russians indictment. Last time a President blindly believed the intelligence community we were looking for massive WMD stocks
202 2018-07-16 21:28:19 Possible rotation out of tech stocks could send buyers to the bargain casino sector.  Seen it before. $wynn $lvs $mlco $mgm
203 2018-07-16 21:26:18 Well that explains why the stocks tanked today haha

205 2018-07-16 21:24:21 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks close lower amid earnings.
206 2018-07-16 21:24:15 @jimcramer @WarrenBuffett a lot of VOL today and those FANG stock or worth over 2.7T (what happens if & when those stocks one day crash) do 4 stocks have the ability to take down the entire S&P 500. Today would you have said this is IRRATIONAL BEHAVIOR. FANG is down & BANKS r UP.
207 2018-07-16 21:23:37 much like others have said, forbidden planet is for brand new issues only and deadhead stocks back issues. deadhead is better than it used to be, but is stereotypically for old men who drink heavily and smoke weed and pretend to still like comics bc they read transmet in the 90s
208 2018-07-16 21:22:50 You don't need to be a shill for bubble stocks

212 2018-07-16 21:21:41 My president , this one is a very tall dream. D dutch farmers form cooperatives dat build these factories so as to trade their stocks n u said build fact n source raw material locally?. Nig Directors milk d coy dry.
213 2018-07-16 21:21:30 Market values a stock basis its fundamentals. If a Co keep earning good profits and have lot of tail wind due to favourable market conditions then whatever happens to other stocks doesn’t have any bearing on the performing Co.
214 2018-07-16 21:20:36 Ang pag-deliver kasi ng mga books, from the source papunta sa mga bookstore na malalapit. Ang kadalasang naunang nagkakaroon ng stocks ay ang mga malalapit na bookstores sa main. 

Pero hindi ko po alam kung saan, maghintay na lang tayo 
215 2018-07-16 21:20:22 @GuyAdami to me it seems like we just talk about the same stocks every day and bitcoin. I would love to hear your take on the metals especially with tariffs and forcing more US business
216 2018-07-16 21:19:55 I work for an Amazon adjacent company (we manage 3rd party businesse's business on Amazon) and let me tell you: today is working and it's hellishly wonderful to experience. Everyone is freaking the fuck out. The internal systems are all down right now. Amazon's stocks are down.
217 2018-07-16 21:18:23 @bamabroker Normal?! A few stocks leading this market isn't normal, especially when there is massive deterioration that is clear to see if one moves away from those 5 stocks. #hubris

219 2018-07-16 21:18:06 think a lot of people will be pouring themselves a strong one when they watch the evening news tonight. good time to invest in booze stocks?
220 2018-07-16 21:17:44 This is the second time cute cavuto has jumped into the deep end and couldn’t swim. I’m done with that fool. By the way stocks was up today. That’s his gig and should stick to it.
221 2018-07-16 21:16:52 Bishen, lives on Seagate Ave with lots of cats.

Put all their savings into maca root stocks. Can't retire.
222 2018-07-16 21:16:45 Trump should just stay in Russia. Then, seize all of his bank accts, real estate, stocks, yachts. Sanction the crap out of Russia, return our country to NATO, with good trade deals that benefit Americans!
223 2018-07-16 21:16:07 I’m the reason why our stocks went up. Just know we about to make some executive moves soon boys 
224 2018-07-16 21:15:48 people think Elon was harsh. We own growth and value stocks. Value is relative to the future growth of the company. Not absolute price.
225 2018-07-16 21:15:44 WORLD STOCKS -of corn / wheat set to fall this year with corn dropping the most - US may drop to under 50% S/U. Soybeans stocks up, primarily in the USA.

227 2018-07-16 21:14:45 What going on with Amazon today? Stocks falling website problems...Hmm
228 2018-07-16 21:14:25 People are realizing tonight that individual stocks who have crazy high price to earnings ratios are "priced" by the market for perfection.  When the earnings disappoint, the stock gets hammered.  This pretty much sums up the value vs. growth argument.  #valuestocks
229 2018-07-16 21:13:25 Interesting observation #Uranium spot price v Uranium stocks. BAP Spot @ $23.31 within 0.50c of the high this year only another 2.14% increase required, yet #URA down circa -20% from high, #UraniumEnergy -21%, #DenisonMinesCo -15%, #NextGen -21% looks like some serious value here
230 2018-07-16 21:12:25 Doesn't Soros make most of his money shorting stocks and bonds with insider information (ie. stealing from honest people)? You may call that "legendary". I call it theft.
231 2018-07-16 21:11:03 Yup. High P/E stocks expect QoQ results to be perfect for years/decades when companies don’t work that way. They have ups and downs. One bad result and share price will nosedive.

But then again some people have had success with momentum. To each his own. I like to stay away.
232 2018-07-16 21:10:14 Doesn't Soros make most of his money shorting stocks and bonds with insider information (ie. stealing from honest people)? You may call that brilliant. I call it theft.
233 2018-07-16 21:10:12 It’s a rip off you have to buy Broccoli stocks fresh

236 2018-07-16 21:08:27 The POTUS comments really separate folks with Federal fallout shelters from those without shelters. Official Washington has shelters and defense stocks, clearly prefers war. People with just duct tape generally prefer peace with Russia.
237 2018-07-16 21:07:33 Let's see how much of a rally these bank stocks go for. Decided to hold.

242 2018-07-16 21:03:56 as a stock holder, I agree as well.  And, I actually do by stocks based on my own weird form of ethics. Tesla's moving us towards a better world.  So, even if Elon is a bit of a nut-case sometimes, the overall direction is extremely good and it is Elon's guidance that does it.
243 2018-07-16 21:03:41 BUT FIRST . . . we need to lock in the stocks people who write 'publically' instead of 'publicly'.

267 2018-07-16 20:59:54 Why is it hysterical?.  Same holders own all those stocks.  Sell the others to reconcile margin call losses on $NFLX?  Right? Basically "FANG" is a small sector ETF at this point and should be treated that way.  Each is simply a constituent of the sector with similar betas
268 2018-07-16 20:59:33 took a loss today, let my options expire which I usually never do but the markets kept trying to get going, but couldnt hold up. $SPY still near that key $280 level so, will be on watch tomorrow. #Trader #Options #stocks #progress #Improve #patience #markets #Finance

299 2018-07-16 20:46:00 Well $NFLX getting their asses kicked is most likely gonna mean $IQ gets smacked tomorrow. In spite of the fact that one has nothing to do with the other. I feel like the Chinese tech stocks are all being held down by stuff that won't actually affect them.

302 2018-07-16 20:44:00 Some folks might have hoped for stocks to dive after Trump's performance. But big investors won't care if his defense of Putin harms US democracy. They'll only mind if it threatens US corporate profits. So far, it doesn't. In fact, Trump in Putin's pocket might be good for corps.

How would a global conglomerate distribute stocks priced at 1800$ to people whose marketable skill is packaging goods into a cartboard box? Common sense factor!?

414 2018-07-16 19:57:14 I've been known to like buying dips, but the dips in the pot stocks right now aren't looking all that attractive. Too many plays are under the moving averages and not yet at strong support levels. "Cheap" is always relative. Sitting on my hands right now...

525 2018-07-16 18:52:19 Opinion: Don't rely on borrowed money to build stability. Use it for emergencies that stable savings can't pay for. Note: Stable doesn't mean 'no-risk', either. Putting it into generally safe stocks, for example, is still stable savings.
526 2018-07-16 18:51:13 Many stocks are setting up bullishly for this earnings season. How they respond to the reports is the important part, though.

People are so much for these businesses as if they can estimate earnings beyond 30 years. Currently Quality is the most used word in the market. In next decade it will be margin of safety.
528 2018-07-16 18:48:03 Or maybe Trump keeps tanking the market that all the oligarchs are buying up the stocks and real estate. He did dismiss the sanctions???????

536 2018-07-16 18:42:58 Value investing is not just about buying stocks with a low price to earnings ratio, that’s a too simplistic and ultimately myopic approach. The true essence of value investing is buying a company for a market price below the intrinsic value of the business.

583 2018-07-16 18:08:57 if you are new to stocks  and want to study systematically I highly recommend  these 3 books as  a great starting point
Why stocks go up and down by William Pike 
Learn to earn by Peter Lynch 
The accounting game by Darrell and Judith 

Master these books ...
584 2018-07-16 18:08:27 I think Peter that this time around (my hypothesis) it is gold that will break out first and silver and gold stocks will follow contrary to what happened in the 60s and 70s.
585 2018-07-16 18:07:25 @AskRobinhood Please consider adding the option to seperate your stocks and crypto portfolio. This way its easier to determine how each asset is performing, as otherwise crypto can easily drag the porfolio report up or down.
586 2018-07-16 18:07:08 Real wages are still stagnant and the @GOP works diligently to see they stay that way. Over 3/4 of Fortune 500 companies have no intention of passing on savings to employees. 3/4 of business used their tax saving to buy back stocks and enrich management.
It's not working.

698 2018-07-16 17:14:03 The cultural stocks in nostalgia are so high right now because wallowing in the warm glow of the past is so much more preferable than the garbage fire that is the present.
699 2018-07-16 17:13:52 Agreed again. But many don't currently care about third party and those of us who do will have the option - which is an improvement.  Also, yes to systemic risk but in the end (just as with individual stocks now), value will win over time.

3. spend stocks in bull mkts, bonds in bear mkts
4. stay the course

Simple, but definitely not easy.

790 2018-07-16 16:34:44 So it seems Trump and Putin to become friends....(the deep state must be worried!), stocks in the US Military Industrial Complex should tumble. They need war and plenty of distablisation in order to thrive....

792 2018-07-16 16:34:21 Since the highs of 2000 to today S&P is up 88%, that's 4.9% a year return add 1.5% for dividends = 6.4%... How is that much different than owning corporate bond funds during the same period?

933 2018-07-16 15:36:48 Because the Big Banks' loans and derivatives books and Multinational foreign earnings are immune to an emerging market crisis, as is the US to a global trade war. This is definitely NOT the reason US Bank stocks have been under pressure recently. #Contagion NOT a factor.

1049 2018-07-16 14:50:26 Honestly, I don't really trade bank stocks anymore. I took a bad loss on GS and BAC last year that kinda put me off of them. But I'll take a look at $BAC now.
1050 2018-07-16 14:50:24 a family member who has never consumed Cannabis and actually looks down on me for consuming just said in a panic "I have to sell my stocks if I wanna ever go to the states" lmaoooooooooooooooooooooooo you will get no sympathy from me
1051 2018-07-16 14:50:06 Every once in a while I remind myself to stay humble to avoid being reminded by the market.

1180 2018-07-16 14:03:13 The best part about options strategies is you mostly are playing a range within which you are in the green. As opposed to directional calls in futures and stocks where there is no buffer.

1215 2018-07-16 13:49:23 It's very likely to do what most stocks do - spike and then drop. I consider it more of a LT hold because 1404 is due soon-ish, and they're on track for another massive milestone payment from Valeant for Relistor at the end of the year. Ultimately no one knows until it happens.

1) Think of stocks as small pieces of the business. 
2) Look at market fluctuations as your friend, not foe. 
3) Profit from folly rather than participate in it. 
4) The three most important words of investing are “Margin of Safety.”

1319 2018-07-16 13:04:51 Typically you wouldn’t insure calls because they already have limited risk. A call would be a small percentage of the stocks overall risk. E.g. if the stock is trading at 100/share, the call might cost 3.00 or be only 3% of the stocks value. Use a stop loss to reduce more risk.

3 Stick to Index futures mostly for shorting

1554 2018-07-16 10:42:50 You should know, otherwise you would have had shares in an unhedged managed fund which included a not-insubstantial amount of stocks from both companies.
1555 2018-07-16 10:41:59 Ahh yes, let's talk about the stocks and bonds in society, that'll definitely be entertaining lololol
1556 2018-07-16 10:39:25 Agreed. Of the understanding a BIG fall in stocks from 4/4 2018. My  guess.. At about the same time crypto regulations start happening and alot of stock funds will move into crypto creating a BIG bull market in crypto from 4/4 2018.

1564 2018-07-16 10:28:50 It’s clear they did more.   The stock market predicted all year in 2016 gop would win.   Oil stocks were rallying.  Solar were down big.   Guess who won?  Oil industry,  think Koch brothers, Russia.  A connection for sure

1576 2018-07-16 10:22:57 Sir, one will have to be very selective. Stocks that are plunging are becasue of valid reasons - high debt, corporate governance, lack of growth. Quality stocks are not in value zone since FMs continue to park money over there.
1577 2018-07-16 10:18:45 This is one of the best times to be in stock markets. Yes, stocks are falling. And yes, they're giving you the chance to build portfolios looking many years forward. Valuations will probably improve further in 2018, if you intend to be a buyer.

1594 2018-07-16 10:04:02 Sir these stocks will turn into penny stocks. Stock price is driven by EPS when here no. of shares is infinity. As they are doing endless issue to govt. where is the EPS ? USA style of crisis will happen in PSU banks that will clean the slate.

1597 2018-07-16 10:03:22 Second, anything which is known in market always gets priced. 

Stock market does not wait for 1 year to price that risk. 

So, on MSO stocks, rest assured that market was not pricing in the risk and will adjust accordingly over the next 3 months.

1604 2018-07-16 09:59:27 I did not say I announced. All I said, that interpretation of AGM announcement was related to these stocks.

1609 2018-07-16 09:58:05 Maybe one day I’ll modify, especially in the next “boom” sector. Now I’ve witnessed a few in lithium, weed, cobalt, vanadium stocks etc. I can potentially man up and hold some overnight longs when the next one comes along
1610 2018-07-16 09:57:50 Holding for 11 months patiently, wanna make the most of it, do not want to mess up in the end. I am sure in August, September, all these quality stocks will also fall.

1615 2018-07-16 09:55:30 Stocks are down because the stocks went ahead of the business. Stocks are moved by investors , businesses by businemen. Stay with businessmen as far as possible.

1619 2018-07-16 09:49:27 Stocks appreciate? Lol!!!

The amount I spent in buying stocks around 2007-2008, if I write it here, you’d say I’m lying. If I used that money to party, it would have been a massive turn up for weeks.

Truth is, let everybody spend their money the best way they deem.

1621 2018-07-16 09:47:28 Not sure why I do it but I tend to seriously think twice or stay away from stocks when I notice a lot of traders going for them. Like $SYA as an example. Not saying it's a bad stock at all but I'd rather blaze my own trail on a less popular stock than follow the common path.
1622 2018-07-16 09:46:50 1 He has to delivery by T+2 after the expiry day.
2. think of what hte long guy will do. He is leveraged nearly 10x. He has to put 10x of his margin to buy stocks. 

Also note that there are lot of arb funds in the markets who are future sellers. They have the underlying stock.

1890 2018-07-16 05:56:59 I think you need to take a look at what stocks went up. The stocks for goods produced and sold domestically did not really. The ones that participate from the weaker Pound did but that means it is more expensive for UK to buy abroad.
1891 2018-07-16 05:56:41 It wasn’t exactly tax reform. It was a Tax Cut for corporations and wealthy people. Corporations took their savings and bought more company stocks, got executives more perks and great healthcare for life! Peanuts or nothing for the rest of us.

The quality of listed gold stocks (ex Sth Africa) is now probably the best since gold was freed up in 1971 and the overall quality of the indices is probably also the best (the 2000-2011 ASX gold Index was woeful) so I see the breakouts as leading gold.

2092 2018-07-16 02:38:34 Thanks Greg! ROE+PTM is a great filter to search for leaders. Concentration is a huge factor in achieving outsized gains. That said, the number of stocks in one's portfolio varies per trader/investor and may be based on one's risk profile, portfolio size, etc.

2173 2018-07-16 01:25:13 Let's talk about Risk and Stocks! Risk is the WRONG word, it should be volatility!

Risk: The possibility of a company to go bankrupt and take your money with it.

Volatility: How fast a stock price goes up/down. This is what scares investors!

2187 2018-07-16 01:06:42 I heard any interesting piece on NPR today positing that the Russians “invested” in Trump (among other people) in the 80s and it paid off. They used the metaphor of penny stocks turning in to blue chip. Made sense.

2200 2018-07-16 00:57:20 Only a small percentage of stocks contribute to wealth creation. So index has more losers than winners. By buying index we are also buying many losers. I believe by prudent stock picking, we would be able to have more winners than losers.

2213 2018-07-16 00:36:46 The last time we were in this position was the same time value stocks were in their last epic bear market.
2214 2018-07-16 00:36:28 Except it's a fallacy that short sellers help reign in overbought stocks. They don't short overbought stocks, they only smash stocks that are weak, stepping on the fingers of shareholders hanging on for dear life, hoping they fall to their death off the cliff.
2215 2018-07-16 00:36:13 We issue fishing quotas in order to prevent a tragedy of the commons, and keep the value of fish stocks high ie artificial scarcity. That is a necessity with the shared environment. High land values only become a problem when landowners don't compensate those they exclude.

2228 2018-07-16 00:20:48 The tough part about looking at the market as a buy and hold investment at these levels is that eventually Democrats will be in the majority, eventually Democrats will take the White House, and all of the regulatory reforms and tax cuts will be reversed.
