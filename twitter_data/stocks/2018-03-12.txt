11 2018-03-12 23:54:38 Unbelievably terrible decisions. You are going to loose your conservative base. Bump stocks are just the foot in the door. It’s not a line in the sand it’s a gouge in stone. Don’t give one inch.
12 2018-03-12 23:53:38 Meh. Below average, I’d say. As long as knives don’t have bump-stocks, we’ll be alright.

41 2018-03-12 23:49:42 Who do you think who owns the stocks in their IRAs. It's the workers stupid
42 2018-03-12 23:49:18 Yeah it seems like Trump Peter Navarro and people that dump their Steel stocks just before this was announced are now trying to fool the American people into believing this will bring jobs back open up new steel mills which is a bunch of BS! It's only going to hurt us financially

45 2018-03-12 23:47:03 Why is he screwing his base on the 2A?  If he does any of these, he's  toast.  Raise the min purchase age, ban slide stocks, ban any guns that are currently legal, bans high capacity magazine, or passes any other 2A restrictive law that isn't going to do shit to stop crazies.
46 2018-03-12 23:46:25 Bump stocks SHOULD be illegal. (See how reasonable conservatives can be? Try getting a liberal to bend on anything!) Please explain to me the difference between an AR15 and a hunting rifle. Please.
47 2018-03-12 23:44:14 @realDonaldTrump so who’s afraid of the nra? Bump stocks, ar15 age limit??? Appears u r
48 2018-03-12 23:44:05 (makes note to self to sell all stocks tomorrow)
49 2018-03-12 23:43:43 And here we go AGAIN. We don’t want your handgun or your hunting rifle ... protect away. We do want AR15 style weapons, large capacity magazines & bump stocks. Your 2nd Amendment is protected, our children are safer. This should be so simple.
50 2018-03-12 23:42:47 Background checks and banning bump stocks are an infringement on 2A. Why not write useful legislation to free us all of the shackles of tyranny of ANY gun control and to prevent government from ever penning any fringement on 2A? Q lied
51 2018-03-12 23:41:45 India has a surplus of lentil production this year and also last year. It is more a quality reason and difficult access to Indian grain stocks as reasons to buy from Australia rather than filling a supply shortfall.

54 2018-03-12 23:38:53 Banning bump stocks solves nothing. As with gun control, it is blaming the gun or the accessories and not the person using them. If a drunk driver kills someone , you don't blame the car! I voted for you because you were for protecting our second amendment rights.
55 2018-03-12 23:38:42 1) Fire Betsy and 2) stand up to the NRA about age limits, bump stocks and waiting periods.

73 2018-03-12 23:35:07 Getting rid of bump stocks is a huge step in the wrong direction Mr. President, myself and millions of gun owners urge you to reconsider this ban.

75 2018-03-12 23:32:19 I don’t always agree with you. Before we make a decision about bump stocks, don’t you think the FBI should finish their Las Vegas investigation. 5 months and still no answers. FBI incompetence
76 2018-03-12 23:31:45 What if the country of Israel banned guns ?  I'm betting the terrorists would just ignore that right ?
  Criminals/terrorists are one in the same, effectively nuetering America be it banning bump stocks or any gun semi or bolt, lever, is not only stupid, it's asking 4 trouble.!

87 2018-03-12 23:27:32 Where is it say assault rifles? Or bump stocks?
88 2018-03-12 23:27:14 Bump stocks should be allowed for those for whom they were designed, certain physically disabled. For others  make them available through NFA.
Remove suppressors from NFA! #2A
89 2018-03-12 23:26:38 I don't have a definitive answer to that... but thanks for noticing I'm not a series of talking points. I can't see anyone liking it the topics would be bump stocks and engineered limits to auto-reload speeds.
90 2018-03-12 23:25:50 Ask him how banning bump stocks will effect crime?
91 2018-03-12 23:25:29 Are you going to band belts and ropes because you can do the same thing that the bump stocks do? You will have to band life because you will not stop evil from hurting people ever so why go down the road of taking more rights away I know are government wants more prisons
92 2018-03-12 23:25:02 In favor of all of that except the bump stocks, but that’s just appeasement for the liberal left that wants to gut the 2nd amendment.
93 2018-03-12 23:24:39 Sorry, no. 400 rounds a minute is just hyperbolic hysteria. And yes, bump stocks should be illegal. That a gun’s SOLE PURPOSE is an irrelevant pivot in the discussion. The gun- without the maniac behind it- poses no threat. This ain’t a cartoon. Let’s try to keep it honest.

97 2018-03-12 23:21:05 With the stolen seat, perhaps the SCOTUS would rule in favor of the NRA position. That doesn't mean it's what the authors intended. How could they predict assault weapons and bump-stocks? That's why I suggest a sensible re-interpretation of the amendment rather than appeal.

99 2018-03-12 23:17:06 Something David Ryan told me at a 1994 seminar; find the sma that a particular stock and it's group follow and remember that some will not any sma. The latter group are generally not leading growth stocks.

103 2018-03-12 23:14:50 Clearly guns kill people, that’s what they were created to do, because bows and arrows didn’t do it well enough. But I’m a realist. Like you said before, America is awash with firearms. Restricting Semi auto rifles and banning bump stocks (Vegas) would be a good reform.  1/2
104 2018-03-12 23:14:20 No need to mess with bump stocks or other accessories. Let ATF stick with actual firearms .or..better yet..start downsizing or eliminating federal alphabet agencies.

107 2018-03-12 23:10:08 Please do.  The more eyes the better.  I had seen that their recent S3 was filed and filled February 6th and assumed they would not file another.  Unfortuntely they did.  To the same token, unfortunately 80% of the stocks under $20 are shady.  That's just sort of how it goes

110 2018-03-12 23:07:05 Except that the Russian who invented it now resides in America and during the cold war the Americans helped the Russians destroy all their stocks of biological and chemical weapons because the containers they were stored in were too unstable to move.

112 2018-03-12 23:06:02 Trump also pledged to ban bump stocks. Where is the legislation for that? We also need to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
113 2018-03-12 23:05:53 I am very bullish on bitcoin through the next three years. Whether or not 2018 is sawtooth pattern. Bullish on stocks but not as much as BTC
114 2018-03-12 23:05:30 I get that this feels like chipping away at 2A. But:
 1) background checks would already be stronger if govt just filed paperwork properly.
 2) bump stocks are a novelty, at best.
 3) if Trump can get rid of the gun free school zone and arm some teachers, that's HUGE for 2A!

123 2018-03-12 23:01:40 If the argument is that action results from the behavior of people and not devices, banning bump stocks is counter intuitive IMO
124 2018-03-12 23:01:25 Me too, as well as outlawing bump stocks. Buy bucks have had some success in the inner cities, but so often it’s the law abiding citizens turning them in. I’m an NRA member and have been for years, but not a fanatic by any means.

126 2018-03-12 23:00:14 @DarrylVGreen1 Hey Darryl. How was your day today? I was just going to give you a
heads up on one of my X followers I see is also yours. Ronda Shaffner. She's actually
a shorter who gets on other people's twitter pages & pumps stocks like ANDI only to short them.  I blocked her.
127 2018-03-12 23:00:11 I love you @realDonaldTrump but i dont agree with banning bump stocks. That will do nothing but i see you my boy!!! Give them a little to nibble on. They are going to want more tho. You opened the door for more. Be careful!
128 2018-03-12 22:59:51 Oh hi there!
129 2018-03-12 22:59:38 Saw you on Ari Melber. You mentioned something that allows companies to do more buy backs of stocks or something to that effect. Huh? You lost me. What was the name of the whatever?
130 2018-03-12 22:59:33 Add MU but yes google and facebook are not attractive stocks to own in my opinion
131 2018-03-12 22:59:25 Bump stocks are not machine guns mechanically speaking, but they allow ordinary guns to do what machine guns do. Banning them wouldn't be such a big loss to the gun world, I wouldn't oppose that.
132 2018-03-12 22:58:06 yes, the guy with the 1982 soundboard that said we should all buy stocks because the market was amazing in 2007 and 2008 is totally right on this. #tytlive
133 2018-03-12 22:56:47 Stocks
134 2018-03-12 22:56:46 Most of these certifiable morons can't find evidence the earth is not flat and can't build the case for evolution either.

Follow the money.  How many Republican lawmakers have vodka stocks?
135 2018-03-12 22:56:45 Chances are the CPI will be a sleeper for markets Tuesday, but if not, watch for interest rates to spike and stocks…
136 2018-03-12 22:56:45 See which stocks are posting big moves after the bell.
137 2018-03-12 22:56:15 Is this gonna hurt @intel stocks??
138 2018-03-12 22:55:49 why doesnt the government make it a law that companies have to buy back a percentage of revenues towards share buy backs... then have the government educate the masses informing peeps to buy stocks and to hold. whatever they can afford. then overtime it would compound in value.
139 2018-03-12 22:55:15 Youre not too bright are you? Trump had dinner with NRA to review things that could be negotiated or changed. Like Bump stocks. That just shows he's NOT a dictator. He talks to ppl unlike Obama!
140 2018-03-12 22:53:28 You promised not infringe upon our Second Amendment Rights! You are outlawing bump stocks and now trying to change the age. You keep doing this and you will lose my vote on the next election!
141 2018-03-12 22:53:18 What if the country of Israel banned guns ?  I'm betting the terrorists would just ignore that right ?
  Criminals/terrorists are one in the same, effectively nuetering America be it banning bump stocks or any gun semi or bolt, lever, is not only stupid, it's asking 4 trouble.!
142 2018-03-12 22:51:23 Accidentally carted 2 no intention in taking all the stocks 
143 2018-03-12 22:50:42 Hump stocks?  Sounds kinky
144 2018-03-12 22:50:37 A big win 4 your enemies a loss 4 those who support you Bump stocks are not a problem nor are high capacity magazines or for that matter fully automatic rifles Criminals don't give AF about the laws The 2 amendment has taken a hit but your zombies will exalt you, like my neighbor
145 2018-03-12 22:50:36 Makes no difference to us Trump supporters. We love @realDonaldTrump and you’re making money off him in stocks. Secretly, you love him too! 
146 2018-03-12 22:49:38 What are bank stocks. My RRSP is at Royal Bank. Should I move it?
147 2018-03-12 22:49:29 @realDonaldTrump You should think VERY hard about banning ALL assault weapons AND bump stocks period. Great to hear your raising the age limit wonderful start.
148 2018-03-12 22:47:11 Yes sir bump stocks are junk, and agree with you sir. But look again they are naming everything you can think of that make it fire with any speed?! We shouldn’t be punished for what others have done sir.
Please say NO! 
To H.R. 5087  Thank you.
149 2018-03-12 22:46:08 Asking the Russians to account for #Novichok stocks, and saying its ‘likely’ that Russians carried out the attack,are simply ways to avoid acting decisively to hold Putin accountable.
150 2018-03-12 22:45:50 The nerve agent was identified at Porton Down, FOUR miles from Salisbury.
The antidote being used was developed there.
Is there proof that the government has control of its stocks?
151 2018-03-12 22:45:49 You know how rich strippers would be if they invested their earnings on stocks.
152 2018-03-12 22:45:21 Can you consider taking personal responsibility? PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY! You are in the senate and wield power. We Americans cannot attend church, concerts, school, bars, without being fearful someone is going to walk in and kill us. Raise the age, ban bump stocks, do something!
153 2018-03-12 22:44:45 If a killer wants to kill. he has a thousand ways. bump stocks out is not the cure but a pain killer.  Gun free zone is a good idea. like school, stadium, airport, any crowded public place can be deployed Xscan machines and operating personnel. That creates jobs and sales
154 2018-03-12 22:44:43 $SPY Days like this is why you don't get too caught up in stocks that aren't just going straight up and so you sell early.  Patience pays :)
155 2018-03-12 22:44:16 What was their payroll back then?
156 2018-03-12 22:43:35 Me and JayR had to play Shears and Loto at Hitstun, ZPK. Their Bang Bros are the best, Mario kept taking stocks and I had trouble edgeguarding Luigi
157 2018-03-12 22:43:14 Thank you. I’m ok raising the age limits but I want all other ages raised also. Voting, trial, enlistment. Could care less about bump stocks. Ban em if ya want, but know that the same effect can be achieved with a rubber band or a belt loop. Now I will need a definition on AW.
158 2018-03-12 22:43:07 It's the policy part that is a bit hard to reconcile.. They are more or less saying 'well yes, obviously the auditor painted a rosier picture and the investor lost money, but imagine what would happen to stocks and shares if we found against?'. Just my opinion, whether correct?
159 2018-03-12 22:42:08 It's a start, but it isn't enough. People 3D print bump stocks. Keep going until rapid fire modern sporting rifles are outlawed.
160 2018-03-12 22:42:05 you're Banning bump stocks and you're not punishing Cruise or the Cowardly Sheriff's that didn't go in there
161 2018-03-12 22:41:58 What if the country of Israel banned guns ?  I'm betting the terrorists would just ignore that right ?
  Criminals/terrorists are one in the same, effectively nuetering America be it banning bump stocks or any gun semi or bolt, lever, is not only stupid, it's asking 4 trouble.!
162 2018-03-12 22:41:50 @rickcatino There is no plan to extend background checks to purchases made at gun shows, private sales, etc.  As to bump stocks, Massachusetts made them illegal LAST OCTOBER. It’s great you guys are still thinking about it. You GOP Cowards can’t stand up to the NRA... SAD !!!
163 2018-03-12 22:41:45 I think bump stocks are stupid to give up since they aren't an issue.
164 2018-03-12 22:41:41 If the stocks had risen so meteoric under Obama y'all would be washing his feet with your hair. A strong America is a strong world. You have no clue.
165 2018-03-12 22:41:04 Major lesson today on keeping losses small or at breakeven after the stock moves in your favor. A nice winner shouldn’t end up being a large loss.  #rookieshit #trading #moveyourstopsonwinners #study #stocks
166 2018-03-12 22:41:01 DeMark had you out of most stocks early 2017
167 2018-03-12 22:40:27 Very strong improvement and strengthening of background checks will be fully backed by White House. Legislation moving forward. Bump Stocks will soon be out. Highly trained expert teachers will be allowed to conceal carry, subject to State Law. Armed guards… by #mandytrumpteam

169 2018-03-12 22:39:53 Unemployment LOW, stocks HIGH....rapprochement w/ N.K. imminent; SC Justice appointed; Dem party a mess, fighting who can go full-communist more... I don't like his style but he's not doing badly.  You seem unhinged.  Sit a while.   Stay away from any guns, please.
170 2018-03-12 22:38:34 .@whitehouse I agree with @gunowners that if you ban bump stocks administratively, then your successor can use this to also outlaw match triggers, magazines & more--using the argument they also "accelerate" the fire of a gun. Instead, insist on clean reciprocity!
171 2018-03-12 22:38:33 Yeah. It sucks having my home value go up 40k, stocks all time high, lowest unemployment in ages, building the military, and very best SCOTUS pick in my life.   Maybe you should move to norkor if u like losing.  U won't like American if u want to see failure.
172 2018-03-12 22:38:04 I am all ears to learn how restricting bump stocks is an effective measure to restrain gun violence.
173 2018-03-12 22:37:23 You’re now splitting hairs. Russia has nerve agents that found their way onto U.K. streets. Either Russia launched the chemical attack that poisoned three people in a U.K. city or they have lost control of their stocks of nerve agent. Whatever happened the issue is Russia
174 2018-03-12 22:37:05 What if the country of Israel banned guns ?  I'm betting the terrorists would just ignore that right ?
  Criminals/terrorists are one in the same, effectively nuetering America be it banning bump stocks or any gun semi or bolt, lever, is not only stupid, it's asking 4 trouble.!
175 2018-03-12 22:36:11 Will be interesting to see how the market reacts. Income stocks will lose their allure, through diminished investor net returns
176 2018-03-12 22:35:59 Let’s start by not arming teachers. Come on, dude. You know this is a crazy ass idea. 

Ok. I’m gonna go there. 
No automatic, semi-automatic weapons
No high capacity mags
No bump stocks
Background checks for all
Mandatory waiting periods for all
Mandatory Training
Liability Ins
177 2018-03-12 22:35:39 Most 'slower' Indicators on DOW are still bullish. Nasdaq Comp small Doji Candle but note on smaller Nasdaq 100 (100 biggest US Tech stocks) it's more like a Hammer. Suggests short term pullback. At upper Bollinger Band.
178 2018-03-12 22:35:29 If society couldn't value dot com stocks or mortgage back securities properly, 

SOCIETY DEFINITELY CAN'T VALUE ANARCHIC GAME THEORETIC CRYPTOCURRENCIES PROPERLY.
179 2018-03-12 22:34:59 Get rid of the gun free zones but not bump stocks. Infringement is a restriction. Stop infringing upon our rights.
180 2018-03-12 22:34:51 @kurteichenwald is a moron. Remember when you told everyone to sell their stocks when trump was elected ? Mkt has not gone down but shot up.  Anything else we should believe you about? #maga
181 2018-03-12 22:34:25 Aquí se nos agotaría stocks de camisas de fuerza.....
182 2018-03-12 22:33:24 AR15, AK47, M16, bump stocks, high capacity magazines, pistol grip shotguns, “Those are all extreme examples that no logical person would agree to allow citizens to be in possession of.” 
Fixed it for you.
183 2018-03-12 22:32:39 @jimcramer Is the steel/aluminum tariff going to be extended to all imports and if so how will that affect Walmart and Home Depot type stocks?
184 2018-03-12 22:30:22 Smash bros. 7 is gonna have no stocks just actual health bars
185 2018-03-12 22:29:32 Mass murderers do not need bump stocks to bump fire. They do not need AR 15s to kill confined people in bars and schools with firebombs.
186 2018-03-12 22:28:44 An OLD Russian substance was used almost certainly from Porton Down stocks (1 of the very few places it is held - Russia has NO chemical weapons).
187 2018-03-12 22:27:32 Will be interested to see how the big fully franked dividend paying stocks (Telstra, Woolies, Big Four etc) react to Labor's bold move against franking rebates when market opens at 10am.
188 2018-03-12 22:27:09 @DaRealStanSmith  how are your stocks doing? I just bought three shares on Apple.
189 2018-03-12 22:27:08 Connecticut’s Tony Hwong: please vote against bump stocks. Please. That way I’ll know you’re the good kind of Republican.
190 2018-03-12 22:26:50 What if the Ruskies have lost control of their stocks..not the #Russian state but a lone wolf or other actors .. out there in our environment carrying #WMD..could be #Putin ... is embarrassed...#salisburyincident
191 2018-03-12 22:26:44 $SPY It's a bull market no doubt however I continue to be selective. Many stocks will rise with the tide but not all will continue higher.
192 2018-03-12 22:26:00 had another discussion about crypto-currency with my tattoo artist and then he casually asked another artist "how are your stocks doing?" apparently the whole shop is doing a little stock market competition with real money. personal investments are the new counter culture.
193 2018-03-12 22:25:58 I'm tired of seeing all these people on twitter and reddit being scammed by financial gurus and shitty stocks.
194 2018-03-12 22:25:41 So TWTR has been doing better than I expected. It looks like there is new support at 33.50-34 which will be a good price for me to get in. Give it 3-5 days, RSI is too high to buy right now. #patience #stocks
195 2018-03-12 22:25:34 I can not say you are wrong. You are right if we want to make money at this market. I am saying that trial data are fundamental for clinical stage bio stocks. Market price could be very different from reality, and sometime manipulated, such as $AUPH in early 2017.
196 2018-03-12 22:24:42 That's bullcrap and you know it. The solution is to ban assault weapons, multiple magazines, bump stocks, and to establish the biggest vesting system ever to make sure only sane people can buy a single fire hand gun.
197 2018-03-12 22:23:56 Publicly traded but yet you restrict the stuff that's gonna sell your stocks better yeah this makes perfect sense
198 2018-03-12 22:23:08 I know why people hate . They invested their money in other countries instead of standing for their own peoples business and stocks . Well i would pull my money out now and invest in the Made in America lol . Go Trump.  Finally we get back our money and economic structure .
199 2018-03-12 22:21:57 weapons of war such as assault weapons of any kind, do not need in the hands of anyone but our military. So yes ban the them, and bump stocks
200 2018-03-12 22:21:36 background checks

eliminate bump stocks
NO to armed teachers!

 AR-15s being addressed ( ie eliminated)?

Are you FLIP-FLOPPING AGAIN??? So disappointing. 
Please do something significant to eliminate gun violence. You’re better than NRA.
201 2018-03-12 22:21:12 A woman just offered to have sex with me if I promoted her washing powder?! Obviously I said no wtf I have morales n strong will power! Almost as strong as the new LemonLoss detergent only retailing at £9.99 in local stores now while stocks last, cheeky fucker x
202 2018-03-12 22:20:21 If I wanted less than 100%, I'd invest in stocks and not a crypto hedge fund, mate.
203 2018-03-12 22:20:10 It’s been named as a specific nerve agent that was created and exclusively owned by Russia. As the PM said, either they deployed it or have lost control of their stocks, which is it?
204 2018-03-12 22:20:07 Bulk-purchasing bump stocks in the event that Ready Player One doesn’t feature the Snorks.
205 2018-03-12 22:19:02 You're sounding like a liberal! Do not touch the 2nd amendment. No ban on bump stocks!
206 2018-03-12 22:16:49 Really what does that have to do with anything the fact that successive Tory/Lab failed to replenish housing stocks
207 2018-03-12 22:16:49 it ain't 2015 Cold, ain't nothing safe out here, I lost so many stocks this weekend to whiffing a grab. It's because people are developing these things called "punishes on reaction," you might try it some time!
208 2018-03-12 22:15:38 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to cure your bipolar disorder
209 2018-03-12 22:14:31 Think 21 is a bad choice Mr. President. You will have Dads and Grandmothers buying them for (hopefully good kids). Agree with bump stocks or at least make it a class 3. Agree with arming teachers (my kids are teachers).  Hang in there Boss been with ya from the start!
210 2018-03-12 22:14:18 Do NOT ban bump stocks! I will NOT vote for you again! I thought you said "if Hillary gets in the 2nd amendment would be under seize"? WELL you'd be doing the same, if not, worse! That is stupid! Bill Clinton banned ARs and aks & crime rose. Bush ended it & Crime dropped!
211 2018-03-12 22:14:04 Thank you for all the hours you have given to this incredible show. Because of what you created I met my boyfriend. He was able to say that he finished campaign one today! It’s been an honor to follow this show from day one. <3
212 2018-03-12 22:13:14 Shame.
Wash my mouth out but would it be worth a move along the M8? Is there a need, I'm thinking their back row stocks aren't so plentiful as here. Quality player who should be in consideration next World Cup. Better to have him under our protection?
213 2018-03-12 22:13:04 And to reiterate, the NRA uses the fact that criminals already have potential access to so many weapons as an excuse to not ban military grade arms (and previously, bump stocks).
214 2018-03-12 22:13:02 Mixed thoughts on the Trump-Gun proposal:
-Happy to see he ditched the age restrictions
-It's common sense to strengthen school security & background checks
-Gun restraining orders are a good idea if due process is respected
-Banning bump stocks is symbolic/silly
-Video games?!?
215 2018-03-12 22:13:00 If only you were the president of the United States & you promised to take action and sign an executive order to ban bump stocks and raise the age limit for assault type weapons
Oh... you are, and you did promise
Now I remember, you’re a liar and a coward
Thanks for reminding me

219 2018-03-12 22:10:26 I'm an AR15 owner and bump stocks degrade the quality of this rifle! They are an accurate hi quality rifle! They shouldn't be used to spray targets! It will test you skills as a marksman.  #2ndAmendment
220 2018-03-12 22:10:10 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
221 2018-03-12 22:09:32 That's great but not if the kids are shot and killed before they graduate.  Food is minor to kids who are now fearful for their lives when they go to school.  I ask you to refuse NRA money and ban bump stocks, weapons of war, and tighten loopholes in background checks.
222 2018-03-12 22:09:30 @DorothyFahn Makes me sick how we already knew Trump is a lying creep but he reinforces it when he said that he wasn't afraid of the NRA and would up the age limit to 21 and ban bump stocks. He still hasn't banned them and he says he's against upping the age limit. What a liar!
223 2018-03-12 22:09:05 "New poison"? They were created before the USSR collapsed. This Russian guy was the scientist who worked on them and he said the stocks were destroyed. #BBCNews
224 2018-03-12 22:08:57 @KenXyro with @SavinTheBees banned on twitter for a week, I think we’re expecting a significant drop in the meme stocks this week aren’t we?
225 2018-03-12 22:08:48 I see the NRA issued its position on recent mass shootings. Increase background checks, take away bump stocks and arm teachers ... oh wait, that came from the White House?
226 2018-03-12 22:06:48 I started watching on that same day. Today my boyfriend finished campaign 1. Thanks for the joy you’ve given all of us.
227 2018-03-12 22:06:04 4 miles from Salisbury there are stocks of the toxin used,
228 2018-03-12 22:05:26 What do you think about TWTR stocks? @jimcramer
229 2018-03-12 22:04:45 Marie could you buy “kids” ones cheaper? La redoute stocks them for like £39 and has 25% off rn
230 2018-03-12 22:04:21 I need a dumbed down run down on stocks.
231 2018-03-12 22:03:55 Hey no brains this isn’t a discussion about bump stocks! Keep up! Wake tf up! FOX news.
232 2018-03-12 22:02:40 Boo banning bump stocks will do nothing! ...
233 2018-03-12 22:01:17 Better check your stocks in Porton Down May.
234 2018-03-12 22:01:02 Hey brains his administration also legalized bump stocks. So brilliant. Know your facts cnn.
235 2018-03-12 22:00:01 Bought stocks in popcorn.
236 2018-03-12 21:59:57 Mr. President, you are terribly wrong to ban bump stocks and are setting a very bad precedent. Our second amendment states the right to carry arms shall not be infringed. You have so disappointed me with this decision. Please change your mind on this.
237 2018-03-12 21:59:52 Apparently, Jacques Amand tells me, the Dutch grower of this Iris is currently building up stocks, so it's not yet available commercially.
238 2018-03-12 21:57:54 Thanks Anthony. You are super. btw, do you also use FA when you select stocks/options? Or only TA?
239 2018-03-12 21:57:53 I cannot undertake to lay my finger on that provision of the federal Constitution which authorizes the federal government to restrict arms in any way whatsoever.  Would you show me the Article, Section and Clause which authorizes the feds to ban bump stocks?
240 2018-03-12 21:57:52 Ruh roh. Looks like someone needs to dump some defense stocks and the US orgy of spending is not cutting it.
241 2018-03-12 21:57:25 We ALL heard him state that he’d support banning bump stocks, raise the min. gun-buying age to 21, and allow LEO’s to confiscate guns without due process.....
Then the next night he had dinner with Wayne LaPierre and his squad.
242 2018-03-12 21:56:52 Semiconductor stocks showed a significant move to the upside, however, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index climbing by 1 percent. With the gain, the index reached a new record closing high. RTT News
243 2018-03-12 21:54:44 Sarin was "developed by" the Germans but they had nothing to do with the Tokyo subway attack in the '90s. Does Porton Down Chem/Bio Warfare Centre (8 miles from crime scene) have any stocks of or capacity to make the nerve agent..??
244 2018-03-12 21:54:38 But we get better trade deals as part of something bigger than just us.
We have not ceded an sovereignty
What has it lost?

Fishing: given in 70s we were all about to empty oceans of fish, stocks have been saved from extinction. Lot of our share lost because fishers sold to Spain
245 2018-03-12 21:53:06 I am a VET and served honorably. I have a concealed weapons permit. I have question for the NRA. Why are you are you against Florida passing legislation for stronger background checks, longer waiting period, raising of purchase age and out law bump stocks? What's the problem?
246 2018-03-12 21:52:37 Stocks
247 2018-03-12 21:52:29 That's a bunch of Right Wing BS. You said Obama was going to take your weapons and there's more out there now than before. You aren't losing any rights. There's no reason for bump stocks, kevlar piercing bullets and military style weapons. You can hunt and defend with others.

250 2018-03-12 21:51:22 BULLSHIT! NRA SHOULD NOT B dictating policy.Raise age limit2 21, incrs waiting period,universal background checks,BAN assault style weapons,bump stocks. YOU'VE taken $30 mil from NRA!NRA owns CONGRESSTeachers should teach,not carry.Grow a pair&do what's RIGHT for the greater GOOD
251 2018-03-12 21:51:15 Right, spreads have wiggled higher from close to record tights. Showing modestly more stress. How is that inconsistent with stocks 3% off their highs?
252 2018-03-12 21:50:46 There is support for a ban on bump stocks and assault weapons. The only organization with clout that is against these changes is the NRA who bought your boss for 30(million) pieces of silver. It is Lent would have been nice if you gave up lying for 40 days! Hypocritical bit#*!
253 2018-03-12 21:49:46 Oooh wait until Kim tells Trumpo to go f@ck himself, having squeezed max propaganda from all this and enough time to build up his warhead stocks. I am so going to love to see you squirm.
You really need to stop getting your info from RT.
254 2018-03-12 21:49:40 @CNBCFastMoney Andrew Left is a d**k. If he doesn’t open his mouth does @netflix go down at all? #shortsellers have no role except to bring stocks down. Leeches. They create nothing. Bottomfeeders. Their only purpose is to sow misery and encourage the devaluation of companies.
255 2018-03-12 21:49:02 the NRA are letting you ban bump stocks? I will believe it when I see it.

257 2018-03-12 21:47:13 This week is the ONLY time I disagree with @DaveRamsey. Time to buy single stocks in paper shredder companies. Lotsa people be bustin' their brackets this weekend!
258 2018-03-12 21:46:46 correction, “let’s ban bump stocks even though it wasn’t used in the shooting what so ever. oh and let’s arm teachers.”
259 2018-03-12 21:46:34 Restricting AR15's, similar semiautomatic weapons and bump stocks won't reduce the number of school shootings but should reduce the number of mangled unrecognizable children per shooting.
260 2018-03-12 21:44:47 Pareil, mais peut être pour d'autres raisons que l'augmentation de la prod US (augmentation d'autres pays, hausse des stocks US, baisse de la conso...etc)
261 2018-03-12 21:44:39 Wonder what kind of drone they are using
262 2018-03-12 21:43:48 NRA doesn't make much money on bump stocks obviously. Let's see the signup statistics for the teachers that want to pack heat, less than 1% I would guess. And it is a huge liability for schools to even allow them to do so.
263 2018-03-12 21:42:55 @KatyTurNBC   He always lies   he also said bump stocks is a done deal

266 2018-03-12 21:40:24 @realDonaldTrump I doubt that you will ever see this but what do you mean by getting rid of bump stocks are they going to be like suppressors(silencers) where you need a tax stamp to own one or are they going to be outright banned all together
267 2018-03-12 21:40:21 The NRA has held different positions in its history. They directly oppose raising the minimum age, banning bump stocks and weapons like the AR-15. They've stood in opposition to more stringent training requirements and more stringent background checks and mental health screenings
268 2018-03-12 21:40:15 Are you sure the NRA fellas are ok with these background checks and an end to bump stocks. I know  you can be so tough dealing with them but you just never know my
269 2018-03-12 21:39:48 Sounds pretty good. Why the stupid bump stocks? Had to throw the Dems a bone? Did you know you can bump fire an AR with a rubber band? Another cool trick is done with a shoelace.
270 2018-03-12 21:39:24 Facebook is dying.  Even Zukerberg sold massive stocks including many key stock holders. 23% less time being spent on line.  People are sick of hostile anti-patriot posts, fake news & shutting down conservative views. It’s poison

274 2018-03-12 21:36:05 My APUSH teacher was talking about stocks during class and all I kept wondering was,”how’s @DavidDobrik’s Tesla stock doing?”
275 2018-03-12 21:36:03 Not a fan, we already had BG checks in place. And bump stocks aren't the problem.  Appeasing the Left. Armed teachers are a good idea though.
276 2018-03-12 21:34:16 I dont know, we are breaking every economic record in history, the biggest tax break in history, Careers returning, Stocks higher than any time in history, Peace coming to NK and ME. Sounds very good to me
277 2018-03-12 21:34:11 It may not fix this problem. But no one thing will. It will take a combination of many initiatives to work toward fixing this issue. 

Why be against the banning of bump stocks? It wouldn't have stopped this shooting but it may stop the next.

301 2018-03-12 21:25:54 Because 18 to 21 is a violation of 2nd Amendment Rights, and most pro 2nd people don't want the restriction on bump stocks. I still support you generally, but if you would realize you're making a mistake and drop those aspects, we'd be fully on board with you....
302 2018-03-12 21:25:48 I gotta draw the line at "bump stocks". If something actually allows full auto fire, that's crossing a line. And I'm missing my left index and have a limited range in that thumb, so I have sympathy for people with disabilities, especially the ones in constant pain. But damn...

308 2018-03-12 21:24:06 So now the @WhiteHouse thinks they need to study raising the age to buy guns, and according to @PressSec, he needs Congress because he can’t just do it alone. Didn’t @POTUS recently say that he was going to get rid of bump stocks by signing an order?

317 2018-03-12 21:20:34 Actually bump stocks work a bit different and do not make the semi-auto guns full auto. Not to mention inherently inaccurate (Vegas shooter was literally shooting fish in a barrel).

359 2018-03-12 20:59:08 What about every other place that students go? The only thing that makes sense is to ban assault weapons & bump stocks have mandatory background and mental health checks.

366 2018-03-12 20:55:43 Not advocating that simple strategy, but that portfolio wouldn't be reliant on big cap stocks (in fact, the opposite, buying the smaller R1000 stocks on average), and would have performed very well, equally weighted.
367 2018-03-12 20:55:03 simple example: take Russell 1000. For each stock, calculated the percentage change in shares outstanding since 1-year ago. Buy 50 stocks with largest percentage reduction in shares. Rebalance on some frequency or condition such that port. is also high buyback yield
368 2018-03-12 20:54:52 Pueden ir de la mano, pero cuando hablamos de déficit, ahorro o des-ahorro, etc., estamos del mundo de los flujos. Cuando hablamos de deuda (independientemente de la denominación), cantidad de activos monetarios, etc., estamos en los stocks. Como Alicia, conviene no confundirlos.
369 2018-03-12 20:54:01 Averages don’t matter much!

375 2018-03-12 20:51:49 Coffee stocks go up this time every year...
376 2018-03-12 20:51:40 I think that's against the law. Every shareholder has the right to attend all meeting. If the can't then something is wrong. Why buy stocks in something if you can't attend the shareholding meetings.
377 2018-03-12 20:50:51 Nice lotto play. $ABHI has a good chance to come out of grays and trade again. That alone will be worth several 100%. They received a big settlement from PC drivers and have been working with the government to use their server optimization. Bought some at these cheap prices.
378 2018-03-12 20:50:19 Took $420 profit on some $GTHP, still holding a majority of my shares, with this India news I could see a multi day runner... also still long $TVIX #stocks
379 2018-03-12 20:50:01 Esta increíble solo mejora el uso de stocks y él bg
380 2018-03-12 20:49:08 Exactly. It would also be naive in the extreme to think that stocks did not fall into the hands of other parties after the collapse of the USSR.
381 2018-03-12 20:49:00 Wondering? He told Representatives most all Common Sense. "UR afraid of NRA-Don't B" If NO GUN FREE ZONES? Students of Age CAN Carry? Obama SIGNED EO 4 DACA,YES N Cong. PRES SIGN EO 4 Outline-YES Age 18-21, Univer CHECKS, Ban Bump Stocks! IF PRES NOT SCARED! GET NRA 2 SUPEM COURT
382 2018-03-12 20:49:00 Tu n'as pas vu la petite astérix en bas du contrat (* dans la limite des stocks disponibles)
383 2018-03-12 20:48:52 Ah oui, exactement. Lui ne lit pas : il encode et décode. Il trie des stocks d'informations, il les comptabilise, les calibre pour les scientomètres. Misère de l'économie de la connaissance.
384 2018-03-12 20:48:31 This mindset is terribly unhealthy for doubles. A character isn't strong by how fast they can get back to the stage or dive in to stop a 2v1. A character is strong by how long they can live and how easily they can take stocks. Your teammate should be easily able to hold off a 2v1
385 2018-03-12 20:47:30 why is a simple, SMALL micro atx case a premium product that no company really offers variety of and nobody fucking stocks, are there really people out there in 2018 who need 7 expansion slots and 2 5.25" bays for their uATX build
386 2018-03-12 20:47:11 Oh yes right. After he said on live camera that he was going to take care of bump stocks right away, he's going to do it himself and make them illegal and it didn't need to be in the bill... sheesh
387 2018-03-12 20:46:43 Maybe Trump should just cut to the chase here and tell the public what stocks to buy to make him richer.
388 2018-03-12 20:46:18 He did this. 

Very strong improvement of background checks will be fully backed by White House. Legislation moving forward. Bump Stocks will soon be out. Highly trained expert teachers will be allowed to conceal carry, subject to State Law. Armed guards OK, deterrent!.
389 2018-03-12 20:45:40 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to cure your insomnia
390 2018-03-12 20:45:29 So you are saying buy.....wait. Sell. Sell right?

I'm not good at stocks. Wait. Not stockings. I'm not wearing them. Do you have to wear them to sell? 

I think my tongue is swelling.
391 2018-03-12 20:44:28 WTF do bump stocks have to do with anything?
392 2018-03-12 20:44:15 Raises? Check the number of states who have raised their minimum wages this year. That is #1 cause for raises. Corp tax breaks are great for them....buying back their stocks!
393 2018-03-12 20:44:12 Global stocks corrected 12% at the end of 2015 and into the next year  ... the bull market really started in February 2016 ... any reason why so many trace it back to March 2009?

400 2018-03-12 20:41:31 this, euxclusive to kill people, not the weapon most utilized by a “well organized militia”, killing 28 times more...but imo since their mostly black and brown people, eh?  Ban the rifle. (Maybe detachable stocks and collapse to under 32” would be best, And a double reload mech?
401 2018-03-12 20:40:18 Trump: I support raising the age limit on gun buys & banning bump stocks & stronger background checks. I support removing guns from the homes of the mentally ill and those accused of domestic violence. I also think some teachers should be armed to deter potential school shooters.
402 2018-03-12 20:40:03 I’ve travelled far and wide, but it turns out that the sacred artefact I’ve been looking for has been right under my nose the whole time.

405 2018-03-12 20:38:10 The stocks my grandmother bought me in the early 90s as an investment aren’t even worth that much
406 2018-03-12 20:37:42 Bump stocks not used in school shootings. Did you ever consider that no guns are used to murder 60 million living babies in own mother's womb? We taught our youth this. When life becomes cheap and disposable inside womb, Life becomes cheap and disposable outside womb. Now seeing.
407 2018-03-12 20:37:33 I remember the same. Some guy from work said, "hey, look at this new search engine." I looked it over and then (in my wisdom) pronounced that it was too plain and never going anywhere. This "skill" for "knowing" the future is why I stopped picking stocks too.
408 2018-03-12 20:37:13 And if you want to see a basher, check out your pall Kelli blue posts on other stocks and Twitter for that matter.
409 2018-03-12 20:37:12 Who cares if it has political support. The fact is in Fl they have laws that persons under 21 cannot buy hand guns but it is ok to sell assault  type weapons that are easily modified to automatic fire at age 18. Will raising the age limit and ban banning Bump Stocks save lives?
410 2018-03-12 20:36:23 We don’t have any stocks left. We only do pre-order; thus, we purchase the right amount only.

Please read the form properly esp the FAQ section! We have clearly stated that we don’t stock.

413 2018-03-12 20:33:58 Yep. *fills bathtub, nails plywood over windows, stocks up on canned goods*
414 2018-03-12 20:33:45 What evidence & delegated authority is being used illegally to ban bump stocks? Its an emotional hysterical narrative. I dont own one but This is Tyranny! IDIOTS making emotional law.Punishing law abiding for the actions of criminals brought to US by the Left destroying morals
415 2018-03-12 20:33:31 The more smashers I meet personally, the more I like the community. South Carolina and Georgia were cool. Highlight of my break though was taking 15 stocks from a crew.

422 2018-03-12 20:31:22 NEXT: @ryanmartin of the @indystar joins us to talk about the guy with AR-15, bump stocks and a scope that had a room downtown over the Woman's March in Jan. @93wibc
423 2018-03-12 20:31:12 Why infringe on our Second Ammendment? Your opening a door for the liberal NWO to disassemble our Constitution, our Rights then our Republic. Bump stocks did not kill the 17 people in Florida. Evil killed those people. Arm the teachers, strick background checks leave 2nd alone
424 2018-03-12 20:30:27 @pakaraima Zacks is an aggregator. We collect the estimates and issue the consensus. We have analyst data on over 4400 stocks.
425 2018-03-12 20:29:53 World stocks ex-US tend higher: Europe +.3%; US -.1%. US market marked time waiting to see what other shoe might drop from the Trump government. That & rising interest-rates are causing investor to be cautious. Market not cheap but fairly valued so has room to run.

428 2018-03-12 20:29:03 Why does stocks look like that guy in men in Black who has his head shot off 
429 2018-03-12 20:28:40 I call shenanigans! If the state of Colorado can legalize marijuana and the state of Florida can do laws stricter gun control, can’t the government ban cheap ass bump stocks!
430 2018-03-12 20:28:21 $RNVA $ANDI Two best stocks in the OTC right now. These two will make many millionaires this year!
431 2018-03-12 20:27:01 I knew this would happen, that Trump would backpedal on both of those issues the banning of bump stocks and the 21 age Requirement, in retrospect it was not honest for him to pretend to do that and then backpedal!
432 2018-03-12 20:26:07 They should have budgeted accordingly, sold some stocks, started a business, refinanced their home... sucked some dick...
433 2018-03-12 20:25:28 @Snapchat @snapchatsupport is this how you treat domestic violence? Joking about it? REALLY? No wonder why your stocks are so down

439 2018-03-12 20:21:11 My goodness, just let it go. The whole thing about pointing out things for your students is just a front for you to bash on a stock. You should never had said anything about $MSPC and stuck to your 4 stocks. How many stocks go up and down in OTC, almost all of them.
440 2018-03-12 20:19:59 That's much more than just bump stocks then. This is what I mean by give an inch, they'll want a mile.
441 2018-03-12 20:19:38 ECB pumped money is flowing into tech stocks from Europe. How long?
442 2018-03-12 20:17:50 You've been bashing this company for months. All you had to do was buy. Could have made money the honest way instead of bashing stocks. Watch what happens when Johan restructures the note. This will FLY UPWARD.
443 2018-03-12 20:17:15 That Etrade commercial with all the old people is one of the saddest things on tv right now. Also you shouldn’t need to know stocks to retire. You should be able to after working for 35 years in America, period. 
444 2018-03-12 20:17:06 It is not illegal to buy or own bump stocks. So why would do people sell and buy them?
445 2018-03-12 20:16:21 But why do we even need bump stocks? I mean gun laws don't work, you said it yourself, so all the bad guys already have fully auto weapons anyway, right? I know they are illegal, but bad guys can just buy them from some hood rat in Chicago or something like that right? Am I wrong
446 2018-03-12 20:16:00 But as a senator you have done NOTHING to protect the lives of NV people. No legislation in favor of background checks, no ban on bump stocks and certainly not a bam on assault rifles.  Just more #NRABloodMoney for you. #HellerLies #DumpDean #HELLERKILLS

448 2018-03-12 20:14:58 @MatadorApp is cool new way to invest in the stock market. Think Venmo for investing. Buy + sell stocks alongside your friends/peers. Social network is great for 1st time investors getting their feet wet + savvy investors/influencers trying to make a name for themselves.
449 2018-03-12 20:14:28 Thank you, kind of you to say so!!! One of my lovely guests Kate @veautyuk stocks your products! I see them on her instagram all the time! I'm so treating myself soon!
450 2018-03-12 20:13:59 You contradict yourself. One minute you paraphrase the old anarchist saw, "good people don't need laws, bad people won't obey them"; the next you support a law against bump stocks.
I respect anarchists, but our  experiment with applying it to gun laws doesn't seem successful.
451 2018-03-12 20:13:56 yeah if you ban bump stocks you just lost my vote
452 2018-03-12 20:13:03 Why bump stocks they don't hurt anybody you guys are just pulling the guns apart and I voted for you Trump protect our rights
453 2018-03-12 20:11:38 Alucinante lo de ACIA, un 270% en solo 3 meses. Ojala tengais algo tan bueno con LX.
454 2018-03-12 20:11:18 You're an idiot if you actually think dems are trying to take away your 2nd Amendment. Laws to strengthen background checks, banning bump stocks & limiting ARs is a far cry from taking awat right to have guns. Damn, watch something besides @FoxNews
455 2018-03-12 20:10:32 مبروك البقر من امريكا والثيران موجوده بقطر 
456 2018-03-12 20:09:45 Are penny stocks worth investing in anymore I havent bought stocks since 2014 help
457 2018-03-12 20:09:14 Bump stocks are not the problem don't infringe of my constitutional rights mr. president
458 2018-03-12 20:08:33 This isn't the case in the data. A simple strategy of high buyback yield stocks (% of shares repurchased last year, net of simultaneous issuance), equally weighted outperforms by even MORE.
459 2018-03-12 20:08:05 After gapping higher at the open, US stocks closed lower on the day: $DJIA -157, $SPX-4
460 2018-03-12 20:08:01 After gapping higher at the open, US stocks closed lower on the day: $DJIA -157, $SPX-4
461 2018-03-12 20:06:26 Only moving bec of the amazing  students at Stoneman Douglas High School! Until you ban assault weapons, these shootings will continue. Many killers don't use bump stocks, are not in any mental health register, or fall through the cracks. No massive gun, no massive shooting.
462 2018-03-12 20:06:16 Yes. I agree with banning bump stocks. I think there should be better screening for people with a history of violence & mental illness. I think background checks with certain weapons should require a person 2 show certificate for firearms safety.
463 2018-03-12 20:05:35 Truuu as long as you spend it wisely. Put that shit in stocks you'll be set for life
464 2018-03-12 20:04:59 I will never lissen to your half baked shit again ..you work for stocks that are crashing
465 2018-03-12 20:04:20 Yes. For something they should be safe, having 20% inflation and more than 50% less buying power on imported goods is not right. Also stocks on the 4 biggest banks went to almost 0(97.5%loss) and evrryone+pensions held them.
466 2018-03-12 20:04:00 With stocks in bubble territory expect strong statement from #FederalReserve on 22nd march along with rate hike. We are looking @ 4 rate hikes this yr.

468 2018-03-12 20:03:10 Weren’t the stocks and the rack outlawed a few centuries back? How is this different other than the technology of the device?
469 2018-03-12 20:03:09 "Bump Stocks will soon be out." I know that you know that is really no threat, but I get it. Give the (sadly ignorant)  emotion driven anti-gun masses something 0bama never gave them.  Brilliant.
470 2018-03-12 20:03:09 Let’s not forget that Trump said he was going to ban bump stocks.  And he’s not afraid of the NRA.
471 2018-03-12 20:03:01 @MattBevin you said the argument about guns being able to fire 3 rounds a min back when the 2nd Amendment was written is weak yet you think the “slippery slope” argument holds up?! We can’t get bump stocks banned & you ACTUALLY THINK the govt will try and disarm America?! DUMB!
472 2018-03-12 20:03:00 Similar manadate and overlapping stocks... unnecessary, ok fine. But how does it add to cost?
473 2018-03-12 20:02:26 Germany stocks mixed at close of trade; #DAX up 0.58%
474 2018-03-12 20:02:03 France stocks higher at close of trade; #CAC 40 up 0.04%. Spain stocks higher at close of trade; #IBEX 35 up 0.43%. U.K. stocks lower at close of trade; #FTSE 100 down 0.02%
475 2018-03-12 20:00:51 99% of the people in America that have heard the phrase "Bump Stock" heard it from the hysterical anti-gun press. Any future criminal use of such stocks is likely inspired by such media coverage.

This is a media and mental health issue.

477 2018-03-12 20:00:15 no surprise and all the large corporations are using those extra dollars to buy back stocks to make themselves richer still...... as we predicted none of what Trump forecast was going to happen, did not.... they're not hiring more people, or giving raises or bonuses...#taxscam
478 2018-03-12 19:59:15 Its not about you personally though is it. Harmonising ages means hot headed 18yr olds don't get to murder 17 people in cold blood. Why is that difficult for you to get? Restrictions on bump stocks would have meant fewer deaths at the Las Vegas shooting.
479 2018-03-12 19:58:45 Why are AR-15S needed by the average citizen? They aren't!! Ban them and semis and gun stocks and mass killings will be greatly reduced. Be a hero instead of a pawn for the NRA!!!!
480 2018-03-12 19:57:50 Invested in stocks yesterday. It’s become an addiction.
481 2018-03-12 19:57:33 Gn to all have nice dream about your dogs not stocks ha
482 2018-03-12 19:55:59 Despite volatile market I am still bullish on few stocks like GNA Axles, Prakash Industries, Escort, Havells, Garware wall rope, balaji amines, graphite India
483 2018-03-12 19:55:21 Curve flattening again. No sign of inflation yet and stocks trying to move higher... something will have to give one way or the other.
484 2018-03-12 19:55:16 Teachers should not be made to work as security guards. No one will want to become a teacher. Bump stocks should be out already, as AR 15 weapons.
485 2018-03-12 19:54:59 some mindless day on stocks, only thing of interest was that dax heli up for ages to allow distribution , and why not after spoo up 80 from the 2720 area where it struggled, all this talk of new ATH exactly what dudes need to sell a bit down, all they want is range ...
486 2018-03-12 19:54:36 Hypotheticals got us Iraq & Libya. Let's wait for REAL investigation, NOT ONE BY PORTON DOWN which houses huge stocks of nerve agents, 15 min. drive frm Salisbury. Use ur common sense, If you want war on our landmass for Washington NeoCons adhere 2 Mason's vile Trotsky rhetoric.
487 2018-03-12 19:54:06 @POTUS I am a Republican
I have supported DJT since the escalator.
I believe in 2A.
I have a CC permit
BUT
I also support Florida 4 passing an age increase for purchasing guns to 21 and illegalizing bump stocks.
AND
I do NOT SUPPORT trophy hunting.
BUT
I continue to support DJT.
488 2018-03-12 19:54:04 Yes, that's a problem. They passed the tax cuts knowing they weren't going to give up anything on spending. As long as corporations have more money (through tax cuts and deregulation) to buy back stocks and fill their pockets, all is well in the world. Who cares about deficits?
489 2018-03-12 19:53:30 Fact is simple, any stock under $20 is a risk to trade or hold long term.  Never get that twisted.  We are trading charts and set ups, if you want to say any 1 stock is a scam, then you need to b eopen to the fact that all stocks are scams.  Just trade accordingly.
490 2018-03-12 19:52:56 Like all that instead of banning bump stocks. Now I'm going to have to find a place to hide mine, damn it
491 2018-03-12 19:51:58 True! but I think rates would probably need to spike to 3%+ before it becomes a bearish factor for SPX..right now rising rates = rising stocks.
492 2018-03-12 19:51:55 In 2018, we may less hear the word "multibagger". 

But good stocks like GNA axles can give good return in 2018.

Pleas note, Automotive axles is the client of GNA axles trading at 30 PE & GNA trading at PE of 22!
493 2018-03-12 19:51:55 Look at how disproportionate the total buyback universe -- dependent upon a few megacap re-purchasers. 

Relying on the aggregate means being highly impacted by a handful of stocks ($Apple $IBM $MSFT $GE $XOM $CAT $WMT) etc.
494 2018-03-12 19:51:30 Get a grip I hope you froze all clients stocks at pre Trump levels. I bet you and your clients are enjoying the Trump market.

506 2018-03-12 19:46:00 I can see it now. I Banned your Gun Stocks and made defenseless people from 18 - 21 by creating a new, free roaming, GUN FREE ZONE. It is going to go splendidly.
507 2018-03-12 19:45:32 If it is, and "bump stocks" are going to be NFA items, that means everyone who bought such a replacement trigger and does not register it with a $200 tax is a Federal felon.  10 years in prison.

514 2018-03-12 19:44:13 I'm not sure! I hate buying toys online, so this is a bummer. Target and Walmart have such small selections and without TRU, toy company stocks are plummeting. 
515 2018-03-12 19:43:49 Bump stocks are a red herring. If you can vote, you should be able to purchase an AR or a handgun. Don’t give in!
516 2018-03-12 19:43:44 I agree with that. But we are hard pressed to stop corrupt politicians that want to ban gun parts like stocks which leads to magazine and trigger bans... The NRA is with this ban. We have a real problem here with orgs that claim to protect the 2nd while banning gun parts.
517 2018-03-12 19:43:31 Team-Stock mode: instead of having one character with 3 stocks you have 3 characters with 1 stock each
518 2018-03-12 19:43:10 @Gundoctor_tv I have a question for you!. Its my understanding bump stocks work using the guns own recoil to move the shooters finger and this make a semi an 'auto' ... My question is.. couldnt you do this with a 3d printer and a spring or even mod a standard stock?

Reality: 30% of fish stocks have either collapsed or are over-exploited, 60% are fully exploited.

530 2018-03-12 19:39:38 Ive seen you pumping plenty of crap plays. I always laugh when people think all sub-penny stocks are not a pump to a certain extant. $MSPC is nowhere close to being the biggest pump.
531 2018-03-12 19:38:39 @GarySMorrow compared to $wmt, $cost charts looks good. all retail sector stocks are prone to sell off on $amzn panic but $cost charts way better than many others.
532 2018-03-12 19:38:38 So what’s the plan for collecting bumpfire stocks? Mine broke the first time I used it so it’s been in pieces in a box somewhere ever since. Ya boy is about to be a felon because I don’t know where I left my evil “machine gun”
533 2018-03-12 19:38:36 The flood of people that talk to me and end up going on about kubernetes reminds me of the Great Depression and shoeshine boys talking stocks. Something will happen sooner than later, hope it hurts less though.

538 2018-03-12 19:37:19 Tis true, I fight them on the short side on one and why I came to hate them honestly. They can prop up stocks too. Good reason to own  them though grrrrr
539 2018-03-12 19:34:27 And so does banning gun parts like bump stocks which you endorse. Banning stocks opens the door to banning magazines, then trigger... You are no better than @realDonaldTrump. You are part of the conspiracy brewing against guns and gun parts.
540 2018-03-12 19:33:56 One should not be looking after stock every day, one should be looking after stocks. #thearchers
541 2018-03-12 19:33:55 What? You thought the vix would hold that much higher and stocks would be the one to flinch?? Haha.. yeah right.
542 2018-03-12 19:32:12 My biggest market thought remains the same: Tons of stocks are showing persistent, big-volume rallies out of bases. Short-term, there's certainly downside potential; but first pause/pullbacks are likely to resolve to the upside.
543 2018-03-12 19:32:01 What would stop the madness is a ban on assault rifles and bump stocks.

I’m not saying to ban all guns from the general public, just from AR15 or bump stocks- anything that makes killing a lot of people at once easy. Please!

559 2018-03-12 19:23:10 No no on, you have to take the lead from Trump. It's the parts that you ban first. Ban pipe, nails, bolts... just like banning bump stocks, then magazines, then triggers... That is how you get it done. Obama is so jealous, he wanted to ban guns and gun parts.
560 2018-03-12 19:22:32 Okay, this is gross... but it gives me an idea for like different stocks or like lemon water ice! :O *runs... okay waddles home and begin my molecular gastronomy*

562 2018-03-12 19:22:17 Instead of bump stocks why not increase the voting age to 30 ? - Can't have immature kids from Marjory Stoneman voting for Bernie Sanders & subverting the american democratic system.
563 2018-03-12 19:21:23 bump stocks must be your 
" sacrificial lamb " because they are a novelty and not a factor in crimes , I guess Trump is becoming a true politician after all.

566 2018-03-12 19:20:53 Do really think banning bump stocks will affect the criminal?  Not st all!!!  banning them will do absolutely nill, nota, zilch, nothing.
567 2018-03-12 19:20:29 Can value investing really work over time if there are examples of some cheap stocks underperforming?
568 2018-03-12 19:20:07 I agree with everything except the bump stocks. I don't see how banning an instrument protects anyone from anything
569 2018-03-12 19:19:44 Maybe. I don't understand how so few people were killed and injured. There were twenty thousand targets. He had scary bump fire stocks. There should have been thousands shot.
570 2018-03-12 19:19:30 I don't think bump stocks are legally considered firearms. It's an accessory in my opinion.

575 2018-03-12 19:17:16 No, Obama couldn't do it. They needed Trump. Trump is banning stocks that increase the rate of fire. Next it will be magazines, trigger... Trump has opened the door which will never be closed again without war in this country. If we don't stop Trump we are screwed.
576 2018-03-12 19:16:46 I love how you can stumble on a book/record store that only stocks independent releases by independent labels and publishers in a corner of a food court/hall. And the book selection is not only out of this world but reflective of the current talent in the city - so cool !

581 2018-03-12 19:15:42 The NRA must be v happy w/45.  SHS just reiterated his gun safety proposals do not include restrictions on guns, bump stocks, or age limits. The proliferation of guns in our country is statistically tied to the # of gun assaults. Much proof of that.  Stop #GUNviolence #NeverAgain
582 2018-03-12 19:15:09 May I suggest that Bump Stocks be regulated as Class 3 items. The background checks are rigorous enough.
583 2018-03-12 19:14:22 did lying sarah just say trump has ended bump stocks, something he’s wanted for a long time?

No wonder ICE teams are working so hard to fill up these private facilities. It's ALL about money and abuse of those who are vulnerable.
588 2018-03-12 19:12:15 Does Saccone want to ban gun parts as well? It's not like the stocks are a big deal. But opening the door to ban anything that increases the rate of fire is very bad. That in the future will include things like magazines, triggers... Obama is jealous of your banning gun parts.

604 2018-03-12 19:08:06 Nice. I was reading how Trump plans to ban stocks that increase the rate of fire. Then I learned that magazines do that and so do triggers. So we can expect more parts banned by Trump or by the democrats because the door is opened by Trump. I though Obama would ban guns/parts.
605 2018-03-12 19:07:49 The US market market is barely growing in real terms. the S&P 500 has de-equitised by almost 1% p.a. in 2017 and for the past 5 yrs compounded annually. Scarce stocks. Perhaps we should not be surprised that US equities trade on the some of the highest valuations right now.
606 2018-03-12 19:07:46 Their previous opinions NOT “honest”?
607 2018-03-12 19:07:35 The tax plan will add TRILLIONS, possibly TENS OF TRILLIONS in debt for what the IMF is saying will only be brief benefits. Stocks nosedived at Trump's tariff announcement, because economists know tariffs are self-harming. Now Dems will take another state in Pennsylvania.

618 2018-03-12 19:02:36 Making a thing illegal only prescribes a way to punish it; It can't make the thing impossible (this is what makes lefties' minds explode). So yeah, they can't stop bump stocks from being made, but they can prosecute people caught with them. That needs to be stopped. #2ndAmendment
619 2018-03-12 19:02:35 Bump stocks have been around for 30 years, but CNN told you they were dangerous and your lack of education caused you to cave. Pathetic joke. No better than Hillary when it comes to this subject.

629 2018-03-12 19:00:22 Why bump stocks have any been confirmed used in a mass shooting or is it a hit against the maker of bump stocks?
630 2018-03-12 19:00:20 Wall Street Instant Update; #Stocks mostly mostly lower into Monday's final trading hour, DJIA down 165 at 25,170, Nasdaq up 25, S&P -5; Oil closes down 1.1%; Gold -.2%
631 2018-03-12 19:00:19 I just trade stocks/cryptos full-time and teach/show others how to do the same. It's awesome I get wear sweats to work then I go to the gym or play hockeyYou know me I'm not a genius, I keep it simple..hit me up sometime I'll teach you

634 2018-03-12 18:59:49 It would be valuable to have Carl Icahn testify (with documentation)  *under oath* before Congress re. the deeply suspicious timing of his sale of steel stocks.
635 2018-03-12 18:59:41 I agree. And I don’t want to ban guns. Any gun. Even the AR. I am not, however, against banning bump stocks. I simply don’t care if they ban them. It’s meaningless and does not affect my 2A rights. At all.
636 2018-03-12 18:59:13 My technical/statistical indicators are still improving for stocks and deteriorating for bonds. I'm also seeing early signs that hedge funds may think that the worst of recent volatility is over. These statements are my own opinion and future results may vary.
637 2018-03-12 18:58:40 "said the White House fully backs strengthening background checks and banning the use of bump stocks, which can turn a semiautomatic weapon into an automatic one. The White House also will move forward with its controversial plan to arm trained teachers with concealed firearms"
638 2018-03-12 18:58:36 Most of it I see in long term oversold sectors like Miners and oil and gas stocks.  It appears stealth accumulation is happening.  Don't believe the hype that institutions are not buying. I'm seeing more signs of that they are. They are just not trying to be aggressive yet.
639 2018-03-12 18:58:03 1-2 mediocre trading days last week, and now back to this junk assed action. Welcome to 2018. $SPY #stocks #markets
640 2018-03-12 18:57:27 People trading crypto smh. Them taxes gonna kill anything you earn lol. Its better to stick to trading options/stocks.
641 2018-03-12 18:56:45 Remember that one day last month when the stocks tanked, everyone's 401(k) plunged, goobers here flipped out? Mine's recovered & then some. Long game.
642 2018-03-12 18:56:12 As long as it’s bump stocks and nothing else No chipping on 2nd amendment
643 2018-03-12 18:56:00 I’ve come to love 4 stocks except when I’m playing pika falcon, then I fucking hate 4 stock
644 2018-03-12 18:55:50 @waff48 Shame for you sharing an outright lie on your noon broadcast. Bump stocks do NOT make guns into "automatic weapons!" They only soften the felt recoil, not change the mechanical operation. I don't care your stance but do NOT promote lies as truth.
645 2018-03-12 18:55:49 It was definitely a good segment.  I was like, I know that guy! The only thing he kinda missed was the potential of cryptocurrencies to provide the accounting of value in general, not just as pseudo stocks.
646 2018-03-12 18:54:45 OK, Mr. President.  I agree with you everything except this.  Raising age limits and banning bump stocks is just a political stunt that accomplishes nothing in the real world. It just looks & feels good.  We Californians have always found ways to circumvent oppressive gun laws.
647 2018-03-12 18:54:43 Banning bump stocks is an appeasement strategy for idiots. Your base is pissed. Only way you recover is if you give us HPA. Democrats beat you. I thought you knew how to negotiate?
648 2018-03-12 18:54:41 #AWrinkleInTime got bad reviews and first reactions. The media was shut and very passive about it. #ReadyPlayerOne gets mixed reactions, the media responds quickly. 

Does the media have stocks at Disney? Sometimes I wonder...
649 2018-03-12 18:54:27 Thank you. Been pumping the same 3 or 4 stocks on the daily for months.

652 2018-03-12 18:54:05 Bump stocks can be made quickly; making them illegal won't stop the use of them by evil doers.  Doesn't make sense.
653 2018-03-12 18:53:16 Mid-Day: Stocks still mixed with DOW and S&P 500 in negative territory; while, MBS improved a bit (now up 13bps).

655 2018-03-12 18:51:50 Issues, close the loopholes on gun show sales. Better background checks. Longer wait periods on semi auto pistols. Ban assault style weapons, large capacity magazines and bump stocks
656 2018-03-12 18:51:34 Just banned bump stocks. But none at all other than that. My son was just showing off his Daniel Defense yesterday. Very accurate.
657 2018-03-12 18:51:24 You are right. Bump stocks are silly, more speed less accuracy. Ironically, I believe that that the death toll at the hideous Las Vegas tragedy would have been even higher had he been aiming each shot rather than simply spraying the crowd.
658 2018-03-12 18:50:51 S&P arbitrarily include / exclude stocks at any time by fiat from the index so that's better for my argument than one supposes.
Like honest climate change data, it's hidden.

662 2018-03-12 18:49:19 It's been amazing watching folks ignore the extreme small build in US stocks YTD -1.2MB.......that's a draw as oppossed to a build of 45MB in 2017 or build of 62 MB in 2016 or a build of 57 MB in 2015. That's roughly 550Kbd under supplied. right?
663 2018-03-12 18:47:16 Funny, just like Trump is saying to the American people about gun stocks.

666 2018-03-12 18:46:43 Anyone even care what indexes are doing ? So 90’s. No such thing as stock market anymore. It’s just a market with stocks . All process
667 2018-03-12 18:46:28 Bump stocks never killed anyone. It was the psychotic person behind it! If you give in on one item, it’ll never end.
668 2018-03-12 18:46:16 Trump will ban gun stocks because the increase rate of fire. How long before high cap magazines and triggers for the same reason? Soon he will be hanging out with David Hogg talking strategies on how to ban AR, AK, M1A... Where Obama failed, Trump succeeds.
669 2018-03-12 18:45:52 I’m with @pguythompson. Are you sure you don’t mean 2030? Hard to get anyone to care if the year is 2300. How could you project fish stocks for 2300?
670 2018-03-12 18:45:42 Can you have a bazooka? Automatic machine gun? Nuclear weapon? 
No cause they’re banned. Semi auto rifles, large capacity magazine, bump stocks should all be banned
671 2018-03-12 18:44:55 @kudenchi @CJWadeTaylor 
How do pkg bombs by Pakistani terrorists equate to AR-15 bump-stocks? Agenda much? Seems to me if you really want mass shootings brought under control, start with your own like-minded liberals since that's who is conducting, & stay on point of tweets.

674 2018-03-12 18:42:33 Florida is not banning AR-15 or bump stocks or their ammunition. It's an orchestrated attempt by Rick Scott to gain votes towards his Senate campaign. Why else did he call the NRA first?

678 2018-03-12 18:42:17 Trump is working hard to do what Obama could not do, incrementally removing the second amendment. First it's gun stocks, then large capacity mags, then triggers...Hogg and Trump will be friends.
679 2018-03-12 18:42:04 What is meant by, bump stocks are out?
680 2018-03-12 18:41:35 And American stocks are also owned by foreign entities. And there was that steel stock dump by one of Trump’s people just before the tariff announcement. And and and...
681 2018-03-12 18:41:27 I can understand bump stocks, not arguing. But what about the real problem? Bombs in Austin don't seem to be making national headlines that something has to be done. How many other bombs, including at schools get left alone. Fix the real problem.

685 2018-03-12 18:40:19 I guess Kyle missed the class where they covered DC v. Heller, in which the Supreme Court ruled that bans on “dangerous and unusual” weapons are constitutional. Like assault rifles, large magazines and bump stocks.

687 2018-03-12 18:39:38 The overwhelming majority of the public want age limits, ban on bump stocks & ARs. YOU are chickening out & folding to the @NRA because YOU ARE AFRAID OF THEM! YOUR JUST BIG TALK BUT NO BACKBONE
688 2018-03-12 18:39:21 I’m fine with background checks, and arming teachers is a good idea too. Banning bump stocks won’t work because banning anything causes a higher demand for it, plus any criminal could easily create their own or use a 3D printer. And honestly, we should decrease the purchase age

695 2018-03-12 18:37:34 Regulating means putting restrictions and creating boundaries on what types of arms individuals can and cannot possess.  It works both ways.  Please show me anywhere in the 2nd amendment any mention of semiautomatic weapons, high capacity magazines, bump stocks or age parameters.
696 2018-03-12 18:37:25 As a legal citizen and gun owner I do not support raising the age limit and disagree with banning bump stocks just because I feel it just the beginning of other bans! Also if people want to go on YouTube they can figure out how to modify it anyways
697 2018-03-12 18:37:01 The STOP School Violence Safety Act-

725 2018-03-12 18:27:10 I hope both sides can get something they want if teachers can carry on campus and bump stocks get banned.
726 2018-03-12 18:26:43 Yes banning bump stocks is a first step.  Stronger background checks and also adding a mental background check on people would help.   Also people not trying to take guns in their carry on luggage would help.   Basic gun safety would help.  Common sense gun laws are better.
727 2018-03-12 18:25:53 @realDonaldJTrump where is your promised executive order banning bump stocks? Please get this done!
728 2018-03-12 18:25:47 I’m sure the dark web has plenty of bump stocks for criminals to come by soooooo.....
729 2018-03-12 18:25:43 And the NRA also thinks silencers and bump stocks are needed... my tweet there was barely pro-NRA in that sense. They are lobbyists, sick ones at that, a lobby putting immense pressure on government with money deals. I thought, as a libertarian, you'd dislike lobbies.

732 2018-03-12 18:24:27 Why gun control on modified gun parts or attachments? Why bump stocks or any gun parts? None of it will stop a criminal from killing people but limits or stops good people from being fully prepared if needed for defence against criminals and terrorism of any kind or just hobby.
733 2018-03-12 18:24:07 Not really. I'm fine with banning bump stocks. I know you are too.
See? We started talking.
734 2018-03-12 18:23:49 Banning bump stocks should have been emergency legislation.  Why the wait?  So vicious males can quickly stock up on them and sell them on the black market?  WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?  Raid the manufacturers and confescate all military weapons.
735 2018-03-12 18:23:36 @realDonaldTrump Ask for a Gun law Omnibus. Get the National reciprocity and SAFE act (suppressors) in exchange for 21 years for a magazine fed semi auto rifle and bump stocks.

742 2018-03-12 18:20:55 I'd say this is mostly true, except that in the early fifties there were fewer non-professionals familiar with small-gauge film stocks through film schools, home movie technology, etc, many of whom _do_ notice the differences in the recent transition.
743 2018-03-12 18:20:54 but what? no excuses :)
744 2018-03-12 18:20:54 Glad the age limit is off the table. I’m all for strengthening background checks and getting rid of bump stocks. I can get behind this.
745 2018-03-12 18:20:28 Raising the age limit on who can buy a gun and gun peripherals is a start. Banning bump stocks is overdue.  Go against the #NRA and ban all types of assault-type styled weapons, really enforce existing gun laws, and ban anyone on a Watchlist & Restraining order from a gun
746 2018-03-12 18:19:55 Trump is listening and plans to ban gun parts. Everyone thought Obama was anti gun. It turns out Trump is the one, not Obama. Go figure, we were all tricked by Trump. First it' stocks, next it"s magazines, then triggers. Trump lied.

748 2018-03-12 18:19:04 I think most people pay for investment/ finical advisors so they can elevate the stress of making a mistake, and have a buffer to blame. Because of this advisors give out conservative stocks, while millennials already know where the market's growing and can profit from it

756 2018-03-12 18:17:39 The Dow has clawed back from the worst of February's sell-off. Now two stocks are poised to race ahead of the…
757 2018-03-12 18:17:30 And that will help with the hundreds of millions of guns on the street right now...HOW?   Guns, their sales, bump stocks...all have NOTHING to do with it. Dealing with Mental health is the only fix...and it takes time and money and work.
758 2018-03-12 18:17:29 I’ll never forget the day Reagan was driving and said watch this and pulled the key out 
759 2018-03-12 18:16:39 i feel like whenever i tell my mom im dieting or going vegan she stocks the house with extra snacks/meat
760 2018-03-12 18:16:09 With all due respect Mr President, this Gun Control business will change nothing with criminals. Banning bump stocks and the modified parts of a gun will not stop a criminal from killing people with a gun even if you ban all guns. Why ruin things for millions of good people?

762 2018-03-12 18:15:21 The law is as the courts interpret it. The supreme court has said states can ban some types of weapons like AR-15s. Maryland has banned over 60 assault weapons which would include AR-`15s with folding stocks and flash suppressors.

766 2018-03-12 18:14:06 The NRA has told me that eighteen year old HIGH SCHOOL KIDS should have that same right to buy assault weapons, bump stocks, silencers, vests, armor piercing ammo and large capacity mags just like any normal American.
What could go wrong?

768 2018-03-12 18:12:38 Even with that president Trump did more about guns than Obama!!
Bump stocks are banned,
769 2018-03-12 18:11:44 Well yes. Though he did use the time to rearm. In 1938 we had no bomb shelters & no food stocks & few aircraft. Buy 1939 we had a stock of food, bomb shelters & the RAF was bigger than the Luftwaffe (see also Battle of Britain).
770 2018-03-12 18:11:39 Great start.  Society still does not need assault weapons though.  Should be banned like bump stocks.
771 2018-03-12 18:11:38 #MAGAt, guns that can kills tons of kids in seconds, aka assault rifles, aka automatic weapons, aka semi-automatic weapons with bump stocks that convert them into automatic weapons, aka weapons of war....have no place in the hands of emotionally deregulated teens or adults.
772 2018-03-12 18:11:35 Gonna make some stocks today for the freezer.
773 2018-03-12 18:11:34 Stocks plunged as DISH Network Corporation unveiled a progressive paintbrush today.

775 2018-03-12 18:10:59 @POTUS is my understanding that he never said he was banning assault weapons. 2 he just said the age issue is out of the question, he was for arming the teachers, and killing Stocks. Stop IT
776 2018-03-12 18:10:55 And in a few years when the tax relief for middle and lower income households are expired, we’ll pay more in taxes/have less money and the super rich/corps will continue to pay less and *buy back stocks*/not invest in employees. #SoMuchWinning #Not
777 2018-03-12 18:10:34 Which is why Russia has destroyed its stocks of chemical weapons! While #UK has its owns stocks at Porton Down OF THIS chemical.
778 2018-03-12 18:09:48 Remember that a lot of european investors (still benefiting from ECB QE) are investing in US stocks pushing valuations higher. European tech sectors is irrelevant if compared to US one. European investors are paying US investors big profits in tech stocks.
779 2018-03-12 18:08:49 The bump stock side-show is also invalid. 

Bump stocks cannot discharge on a bi-pod stand, as seen in the released photos of the staged scene in Paddocks room.

786 2018-03-12 18:06:32 @realDonaldTrump is the COWARD, caving to the NRA. He is afraid to ban the assault weapons of mass destruction, high capacity magazines, bump stocks. He would rather kids get shot than give up NRA $$$$.     more @washingtonpost @nytimes @CNN
787 2018-03-12 18:06:02 Bump stocks are banned!!!
Obama didnt do it
788 2018-03-12 18:05:28 and with stocks like this they will usually come crashing down because reality catches up to it.
789 2018-03-12 18:05:18 There is tremendous PUBLIC support for #GunReformNow  including universal background checks, closing gun show loophole, banning assault weapons in addition to banning bump stocks & better mental health measures. Politicians are too beholden to #NRABloodMoney #ICallBS
790 2018-03-12 18:04:51 Don't be too comforted by that 43% though. If stocks run low there will be shortage.
791 2018-03-12 18:04:13 Dude you are extrapolating from a one day price movement in some over-priced global industrial stocks (and ignoring the one day price movement before in larger magnitude) but I am the one making "sweeping generalizations"?
792 2018-03-12 18:04:09 Why should any of the currencies hodl their value long term? These aren’t stocks or shares, there are no assets as such, and there are so many now that it almost seems like they devalue one and other.
793 2018-03-12 18:03:58 My stocks are doing hell of a better job than my crypto and Im not even looking at them. What a shame. People that own crypto will be the very reason why it will fail.

#cryptocurrency
794 2018-03-12 18:03:52 Did I not hear Trump pound the table about bump stocks & said if congress will not out law them, Trump would do it on his own?  LOL LOL. Guess Trump did not get permission from the NRA to say that.
795 2018-03-12 18:02:04 now that the big haircut is done, which blockchain stocks are going to make a comeback?  i'm thinking early adopters like $btl definitely in the running... still not convinced of $sx, just too much hype out there, but monitoring... anyone?

In hindsight it always looks like you are in the wrong stock. But you never now which stock will rise 10% tomorrow.
800 2018-03-12 17:58:10 33 for me but again he said over and over while he was running no daca then he won now he is for daca and more also hes pushing the ban on bump stocks ( NOT 2 INFRINGE ) it says im waiting but worried !
801 2018-03-12 17:57:18 @realDonaldTrump Mandate mental health & criminal checks for all arms, and have states provide info into central gov't d/base. No bump stocks/automatic weapon(already banned). States allowed (not mandated) to train school personnel to protect students.  Support 2nd amendment
802 2018-03-12 17:57:01 I stand with you president Trump but I don't think that we should get rid of bump stocks like you always say and good guy with a gun can take out a bad guy with a gun

Comprehensive background checks, restricting civilian use of weapons of war & banning bump stocks should be fed law. CT will continue to lead, continue to put residents & public safety 1st.
805 2018-03-12 17:55:43 That's him worrying about what might happen, not what has happened. You ignored strength in a subset of manufacturing stocks on Friday and over-obsessed over intra-day movement today. Signs of obsession and not objectivity.
806 2018-03-12 17:55:34 Are you confused?  Is the NRA for stricter backgrounds? Raising the age to 21?  Against bump stocks?

808 2018-03-12 17:55:10 Way to protect the second amendment. You said you wouldn't lie to us. You lied. You're a liar. Bump stocks will turn into magazines, triggers... You liar. Try this for size. SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED. That doesn't mean a little bit.
809 2018-03-12 17:55:05 You are going to have a hard to redefining automatic rifle to ban them. banning bump stocks by calling it an automatic part is a contradiction to the definition. Still one pull of trigger equals one shot. You gonna ban fingers because you can bumpfire without a stock?
810 2018-03-12 17:54:57 Many Cloud stocks still soaring. $NTNX #289 overall. No current holding.
811 2018-03-12 17:54:18 Research on your own and invest in very good stocks. You will slowly build conviction on those  stocks. When prices fall,  your conviction will help you to hold it for long. If stock idea is borrowed, then conviction level will be less & chance is high that you will sell it fast.
812 2018-03-12 17:54:13 Why ban bump stocks?
813 2018-03-12 17:53:59 stocks of this series going to crash, because of rabada is out.
814 2018-03-12 17:53:36 Russia destroyed its chemical stocks while #UK still produces them (INCLUDING the one claimed used at Salisbury) & #US has 1000's of tons of them. So who is the threat?
815 2018-03-12 17:53:31 Another treading the water market move where bond and stocks are being bought in Goldilocks market dynamics, seems nothing much to do until tomorrow's US CPI data dump

828 2018-03-12 17:50:05 Too many other things are taking over the headlines.
Big question is: why haven’t bump stocks been made illegal yet?
829 2018-03-12 17:49:44 Ah I see. Wonder how much G & M's owners have in energy stocks?
830 2018-03-12 17:49:42 Left out commas. Anyway, bump stocks can turn just about any firearm into a rapid-fire weapon.
831 2018-03-12 17:49:04 Respectfully Sir:Careful what u wish 4@ emotional times!Remember Sgt.York, Audie Murphy & countless other heroic young Men that have lied about their age in order 2Serve their CountryThis,'bump-stocks'&other measures will do no good against psychotic behavior!This will!
832 2018-03-12 17:48:32 Professional athletes tend to be less interested in mundane investments such as stocks and bonds. They prefer sinking money into exciting yet risky businesses such as nightclubs, restaurants, start-up ventures and commercial real estate.
833 2018-03-12 17:47:59 To track stocks according to delivary Quantity
834 2018-03-12 17:47:49 There’s a FAR greater chance that someone will revive the weaponised USSR or other (even US) smallpox stocks, that there is that someone will make a weapon out of a synthesised poxvirus. FAR greater.
835 2018-03-12 17:47:14 Bump stocks were not used in Florida. They were used in Las Vegas.
836 2018-03-12 17:47:11 @realDonaldTrump NRA has got you by the short hairs. 18 yrs olds buying AR-15's. What a Joke. Wayne LaPierre got your nuts in a jar on his mantle. Banning Bump stocks was Ok with after the Vegas shooting.
837 2018-03-12 17:47:09 Hi Tweeps! An uneventful day in stocks! Lots of fuss in the UK about the alleged #NerveGas murder attempt by Russia in Salisbury. I don't know who's behind it but I very much doubt it's Vladimir! I hope it doesn't affect the #WorldCup!
838 2018-03-12 17:46:39 I suspect this is one of the many reasons Ray Dalio is shorting EU & UK stocks relative to the USA (over $22B ). Look at the ETF ratio of EWU:SPY. Continuous down trend since 2007 (over 0.28) now falling below 0.126. Fresh lows since early Feb 2018 shake out.
839 2018-03-12 17:46:36 Actually Trump passed off the bump stock ban to the Justice Department and they are now proposing it. It does not mean it is going to happen. As y'all say, if someone wants a gun they'll get it. Same for bump stocks.
Either way, semi can shoot more and faster than a pistol.
840 2018-03-12 17:46:10 We agree on the Netflix short though. But as long as people see it as a growth stocks the financials won't be questioned. That's just how it is in a bull market

842 2018-03-12 17:45:41 You are not too bright, Obama's ATF people ok's the Bump stocks a few years ago. Left wing media does not want that discussion at all!
843 2018-03-12 17:45:24 The Russian government will never admit doing this; and they cannot admit losing control of their nerve agent stocks. Both are frankly terrifying prospects. And with Trump and Brexit, Britain has never been more alone, and less able to deal with this ongoing threat.

846 2018-03-12 17:44:10 PS the US is starting to wake up to the GOP and it’s criminality! Here in Florida hey actually passed gun legislation! No more bump stocks and 21 to purchase a weapon and the NRA lost its mind over these changes!! If Florida is changing then Texas maybe next!
847 2018-03-12 17:43:55 You completely misread me. I'm actually for banning butt stocks and high capacity magazines I see no need for them in civilian use I also never even remotely said anything close to what you are accusing me of. Also I would love to see a time where this kind of violence stops.
848 2018-03-12 17:43:54 So your banning bump stocks? Just when I started to think you’d stand for something. You cave. Typical.
849 2018-03-12 17:43:25 Bump stocks are irrelevant, I can use a technique to fire full auto on any simiauto.  But aiming is tougher.
850 2018-03-12 17:43:11 GOld may go up 250 pts max...all the bond money goes into stocks...bonds go to zero as lending money is now illegal to the umpire of the universe. i call dibs on all laws since im Oz. end of story thank you.
851 2018-03-12 17:42:59 Now that i have a little litecoin im going to diversify. A little btc and some stocks i think. Going long!
852 2018-03-12 17:42:26 Assault weapons are illegal. See Firearm Owners Protection Act 1986. It prohibits the sale to civilians of automatic (assault) firearms. Bump stocks (which Trumps making illegal) can turn semi-automatic into automatic assault weapons.

857 2018-03-12 17:39:59 Gun control is not what we want. We want gun reform! There is a big difference. No bump stocks, no automatic weapons like AR-15's. Nobody with mental health issues.
858 2018-03-12 17:39:18 I learned my lesson I’m better at trading the stocks nobody paying attention to they always hard in my favor
859 2018-03-12 17:39:16 So either a Russian attack or lost control of its chemicals??? -
Rubbish! More likely Porton Down lost control of its own stocks of the same chemical.
860 2018-03-12 17:39:16 Oh Doctor Dalek, the one that educates the AI via Tweeting into a permanent data bank. What if all loans failed and stocks get all the money?

862 2018-03-12 17:38:57 NRA policies and interventions do kill people. They block ALL conversation, and threaten to with hold money to any politician who does. WE CANT EVEN GET BUMP STOCKS OUTLAWED.
863 2018-03-12 17:38:31 Age limit doesn't make any difference - just had a decorated vet kill 3 women in Calif. You have banned bump stocks - next Dem Prez can ban a class of guns & ammo. Your actions are against 2nd amendment & sets a bad precedent.

879 2018-03-12 17:32:06 So his take is to simply don't do it. Same could be said about penny stocks, commodities, currency trading, gambling in general, or anything with risk.  Can't protect all people from everything.
880 2018-03-12 17:31:25 Yes. Insisting that even bump stocks can’t be bad is unbending and you are fueling the argument that 2A supporters are completely unwilling to compromise. If that’s the case then you will lose this battle.
881 2018-03-12 17:31:24 Oh, and a ban on magazines over 15 rounds and ban accessories that convert or mirror full auto function (bump stocks).
882 2018-03-12 17:31:19 I thought banning bump stocks was the solution.

885 2018-03-12 17:30:19 Why does CNBC give Citroen research time on your show to promote his short selling of stocks and allowing him to make more money for himself. Tell me it is not for the ratings… Hard to believe this goes on. Where is the SEC..
886 2018-03-12 17:30:11 Wow. What a choice of scenarios from the PM.. Either:
1. It was an authorised Russian attack, or 
2. The Russians have lost control of their nerve agent stocks...
887 2018-03-12 17:29:56 European Stocks were slightly lower, struggling to stay in the black. The major averages mainly flat throughout the day.

892 2018-03-12 17:28:06 Don't forget gun buyback programs. Any weapon that's illegal to sell should be illegal to own. AR-15 style weapons, bump stocks, and large capacity clips should all be illegal, a buyback would compensate current owners, get these weapons off the streets, and help sell the policy.
893 2018-03-12 17:28:02 A knee jerk, virtue signaling bill that raises the age of purchase to 21 & banned bump stocks to appease people. NRA supports the ban of bump stocks & said so after Vegas. They don't believe the age limit jump is constitutional, which is why the NRA exists, to represent the 2A.
894 2018-03-12 17:27:34 You’ll use a belt loop to do what? Is that what you used before bump stocks were sold?
895 2018-03-12 17:27:25 Netflix stocks down 10 points today
896 2018-03-12 17:26:42 keep the bump stocks for the true intention of the 2nd Amendment. You will always have criminals. The true purpose of the NRA is the true purpose of the 2nd amendment.
897 2018-03-12 17:25:30 Really?! keep the bump stocks for the true intent of the 2nd Amendment. You will always have criminals. The true purpose of the NRA is the true purpose of the 2nd amendment.
898 2018-03-12 17:25:13 Why weren’t bump stocks banned after Las Vegas, the shooting where it was used? Why now? Well I’ll tell you why, it’s because it’s a midterm election year and the morally bankrupt gop are scared for their political careers! That’s why!
899 2018-03-12 17:24:59 I'm getting real sick of seeing #2A supporters hating on @realDonaldTrump . 1) Kids now are to busy eating Tide pods & figuring out which 72 genders they are to be mature enough to buy a gun! 2) Bump stocks are a novelty so who really cares! Quit being #Liberal retarded. #MAGA
900 2018-03-12 17:24:57 Thanks. I don't know it's been great, but I've realized my mistakes pretty quickly and it hasn't hurt that stocks are launching all over the place.
901 2018-03-12 17:24:06 I understand but they indicate you are not, in fact, willing to compromise. Are bump stocks important enough to you to die on that hill?
902 2018-03-12 17:23:26 What is the Environment Agency doing to combat the threat of otters? Specimen pike and barbel stocks have already been decimated in most counties. Have the EA done anything other than offer U.K. fishing clubs peanuts for otter fencing?
903 2018-03-12 17:23:07 And should Bezos sell all his stocks so as to liquidate that income, the market would react very negatively anyway.
904 2018-03-12 17:22:39 He shouldn't be shamed for retaining the property that gives him power over the company he founded.
I'm all for realizing 282k is an incredible amount, but the stocks are far more valuable than this money he doesn't actually have liquid access to.
905 2018-03-12 17:22:35 I don't think bump stocks are problem, armed teachers to conceal carry as a great idea thank you very much for allowing it to happen arm guards not so good
906 2018-03-12 17:21:56 That's pure alarmism. Sure the idea of limiting bump stocks makes sense. Vets in the military day just that. Background checks & 3 day moratorium is common sense. Harmonising ages when you can buy guns to 21 makes sense. So where's the gun grab in all that?

913 2018-03-12 17:20:40 To sell those stocks is to relinquish power over the company he founded.

917 2018-03-12 17:19:52 Luckily resellering is a relatively recession proof industry. I'm investing a small portion of my profits in dollar store stocks and auto parts stores, as well.
918 2018-03-12 17:19:32 This implies that his net worth isn’t wealth. His stocks have very real value just like money. There’s no reason to say that because his wealth isn’t cash that he’s not ludicrously wealthy.
919 2018-03-12 17:19:31 The idiots who propped it up only because "OMG the dollar dropped!" or "stocks are up so buy oil NOW!" are the ones who deserve to feel the pain the most. At least we go long for the correct reasons (fractals). Those idiots on the other hand........
920 2018-03-12 17:18:43 Looks like ANTH is a bargain right now. Just bought 75 shares @ $0.51 and I'm sure it was worth it. I wouldn't normally play individual stocks, but this should run back up to being profitable eventually...I hope.

928 2018-03-12 17:16:05 I never said confiscation. That's NRA propaganda. 
Common sense gun legislation. Universal background checks. Ban bump stocks. Ban high capacity magazines. Raise the age to 21. Most responsible gun owners agree with those restrictions. The NRA continues to block these reforms.
929 2018-03-12 17:15:50 .@realDonaldTrump banning bump stocks will allow your predecessors to ban other accessories as well. This is not how to solve the problem. Enforcing the laws that already exist should be the first thing that is done before we make new laws. #2AShallNotBeInfringed

943 2018-03-12 17:12:41 There is NOT Rep political support, NRA support or Trump support. 

There IS, however, a great deal of Dem political support &, more importantly, VOTER support for gun control laws, including banning assault weapons, bump stocks & magazines holding more than 10 rounds.
944 2018-03-12 17:12:35 What does bump stocks have to do with guns and the NRA? It would be nice if you Trumper stop regurgitating FOX news. Just because you hear it on Fox doesn't mean repeating it will make u seem smarter.  Actually it is quite the opposite.

998 2018-03-12 16:57:27 Background check laws could be adjusted. Bump stocks probably prevented more deaths in Vegas-you can’t aim with them. If you want to raise age it would require amending the constitution. Being upset and emotional doesn’t negate constitutional rights. Sorry

1041 2018-03-12 16:44:16 Bump stocks had nothing to do with the shootings for god sake. The law enforcement and FBI failed not the law abiding gun owners. Why do  good American gun owners have to pay the price for some terrorist gun smuggling that went sour and fail government agencies ?

1050 2018-03-12 16:42:06 The Bump Stocks are more a Los Vegas issue and it is an item that is not needed.  Turning a semi-automatic rifle to nearly a machine gun is unnecessary.

1065 2018-03-12 16:39:08 At this time of day the 30m opening range is a great tool. To then focus on those stocks with continuing early strength it shortens my list of possible entries.
1066 2018-03-12 16:38:49 Idk what actual negative impact bump stocks have, but I love reasonable high training for select teachers and some armed guards. Also, strengthening ALREADY EXISTING background checks.
1067 2018-03-12 16:38:46 You know what would really help? A ban on assault weapons. Nobody needs those, they are weapons of war. You know what happened in Las Vegas. Banning bump stocks is only part of the answer.
1068 2018-03-12 16:38:12 Bump stocks don't change how a gun shoots. It's a rediclous move.

1070 2018-03-12 16:37:52 What did I read wrong you twat? The tweet said, and you quoted it, stronger background checks, getting rid of bump stocks, and possibility of arming teachers. Good day, fool.
1071 2018-03-12 16:36:40 In 2011 - 70% of stocks corrected over 20% from their peaks. And in early 2016 63% corrected over 20% from their peaks. I’d argue we are only 2 years into the current bull market (2-11-16) and not 9 years
1072 2018-03-12 16:36:25 I agree with all of this but question "bump stocks being out?"?? Why ? Never had one but doubt this part caused anything. It appears it was professional shooters and doubtful they had any need for bump stocks...

1077 2018-03-12 16:34:42 Thank you for that and the bump stocks.  Citizens owning assault weapons please consider as well.

1117 2018-03-12 16:20:51 It’s funny when people use the word “bubble” when describing this market and certain stocks. If you didn’t trade in the late 90s then you have no idea what a real bubble is! Bubble and over priced/expensive is not the same thing.

1121 2018-03-12 16:20:28 He had 10 minutes of uninterrupted shooting. Even without a bump stock, he would have been able to fire hundreds of rounds in that time.

I'm fine with banning bump stocks, personally, but don't pretend that would have made a significant impact on what he did.

1136 2018-03-12 16:15:12 Background checks are not the problem.  Bump stocks not the problem & should not be banned.  Eliminating all gun free zones, enforcement of existing laws, death penalty, too.  Then will get somewhere immediately.  Must turn back to God, too.

1141 2018-03-12 16:13:56 Il me semble, de plus, que les éditeurs ont obligation légale d'informer un auteur avant mise au pilon, et de lui permettre un rachat de tout ou partie des stocks restants, non ? Obligation rarement respectée, à ce que j'ai entendu.
1142 2018-03-12 16:13:47 Criminals of all ages will still get their hands on guns so I don't think raising the age will matter.  Banning AR 15s and bump stocks isn't going to change anything.  Arming teachers is a great idea if they want to carry.

1144 2018-03-12 16:13:41 @mester_mark NO MARK!,  bump stocks to NOT make guns "machine guns", they make semi-automatic to NEARLY automatic. Do your research!! P.S. I'm completely against bump stocks.

1146 2018-03-12 16:13:09 I don't see why not. Bump stocks used to be banned, until Obama's EO made them legal.
1147 2018-03-12 16:13:09 Background checks, banning bump stocks is necessary. Armed security can help, but can also lead to more death, empowering some to use lethal force when not necessary.
Arming teachers is pure stupidity.
1148 2018-03-12 16:12:19 Gear online, which is another issue. The 2nd Amendment needs to stop being stretched to cover every gun related item there is, such as bump stocks, silencers, laser sights and high capacity magazines.
1149 2018-03-12 16:12:12 @whitehouse I agree with @gunowners that if you ban bump stocks administratively, then your successor can use this to also outlaw match triggers, magazines & more--using the argument they also "accelerate" the fire of a gun. Instead, insist on clean reciprocity!Oppose gun control
1150 2018-03-12 16:12:10 Mr. President , I have a tentative thank you.  Need the stronger bc’s. Need the guards at school.  Employees & trained guards.  But bump stocks are a gimmick.  Banning these are like banning 3/2 beer and hoping it will reduce alcoholism.

1155 2018-03-12 16:10:29 Banning bump stocks is a great first step.  Take it a step further, why does any citizen need specialized guns or ammunition intended for the military?

1214 2018-03-12 15:51:05 No, this is stupid. The reason stocks are owned almost entirely by the upper financial strata is that other people can’t afford them.

1264 2018-03-12 15:34:51 I didn’t say the military used bump stocks. And you are incorrect...with a bump stock the recoil of the rifle shoots the bullet with one trigger pull. Essentially becoming fully automatic.

Most of the American funds listed hold at ~10% int'l during period & some bonds. Also, not all US is large cap #stocks
1266 2018-03-12 15:33:56 Mm, I do like bonds. And stocks!
1267 2018-03-12 15:33:53 Not sure abt US, but if u clearly notice abt nifty 2day, it was clearly manipulated such that it remained high, though many stocks ended red
1268 2018-03-12 15:33:09 Have some context: he brought it all the way back from Darkshad having two stocks and ~50% and ended it like that
1269 2018-03-12 15:32:57 Very strong improvement and strengthening of background checks will be fully backed by Me.. Legislation moving forward. Bump Stocks will soon be in schools. Highly trained Corrections Teachers will be allowed to conceal carry, subject to My Law. Armed guards OK, deterrent!.......
1270 2018-03-12 15:32:47 "Stocks start higher"   Thank you Donald!

1273 2018-03-12 15:30:19 Was just saying the same thing. Spring break for traders too ? 
1274 2018-03-12 15:29:54 “Bump stocks are out”!? Worst move you could make in your presidency up to this point. Law abiding citizens dont ask permission for our rights. And we do not ask permission for the ability to defend ourselves how WE see fit. Huge mistake.
1275 2018-03-12 15:29:43 The problem here is giving people guns it's making sure the people who have them are using them for defence not attack things like raising age to 21 on all guns full background check on every gun ban on bump stocks so they can't be turned to automatic are just simple
1276 2018-03-12 15:29:29 That is the ONLY THING, YOU SHOULD BE MAKING DAMNED CERTAIN OF, not age limits, bump stocks & putting DeVos at the helm! The Jeb Bush devotee GLOBALIST? The originator of COMMON CORE? People are unhappy, with your DACA BS, you heard it in PA and your lies about protecting our 2A!
1277 2018-03-12 15:29:25 Trump (after MSD students): we will for sure ban bump stocks
1278 2018-03-12 15:29:17 Bump stocks are a novelty.they do zero.99 % of people never knew what one was until,someone made a claim about 1 in the Vegas shooting. Banning them does zero for crime.
Criminals will still be able to buy them no matter what law is passed.
Once again leaving GOOD people exposed.
1279 2018-03-12 15:29:05 Stocks start to turn negative.  DOW down 145 and S&P down 5.
1280 2018-03-12 15:28:59 Solid catalyst for CPG stocks, though these two are in the fresh vegetable section, which seems somewhat contrived.

1282 2018-03-12 15:27:45 What a stupid cartoon. Nobody is blaming law abiding gun owners.  It is simple (so you SHOULD be able to follow).  Responsible gun ownership includes waiting periods, background checks, banning bump stocks etc. Guns are the reason the US has the highest mass shooting %age. Period

1284 2018-03-12 15:26:50 Is this a joke? 92% of stocks are owned by 20% of the people. There is a similar breakdown with tax cuts. 

These things do not benefit most people right now and when they do the boost is largely insignificant.
1285 2018-03-12 15:26:37 Try more money in our pockets, killing off 98% of Isis, stocks at 48% since election, lowest unemployment rate for blacks and Latinos in history, highest optimism in history, wages going up again, for starters. I need at least 10 more tweets to finish.

1290 2018-03-12 15:25:31 "Investors" invest in things that are worth below intrinsic value or reasonably valued. That can hardly be said about stocks today. Buying something based on the hope of finding a greater fool is gambling, not investing.
1291 2018-03-12 15:25:24 what WH occupant is proposing is weaker than a 2 week old tea bag (borrowed from Dan Rather).  It does not raise the age nor does it ban bump stocks and AR-15's.  NRA bought more inaction from feds.
1292 2018-03-12 15:24:59 ITM ( in the money) means whatever the stocks price is at that particular point you are buying it , just buy a little below. So right now JPM is 117.56, buy strike price at 117 for in the money. But get confused,the price of the option  and the strike price are 2 different things
1293 2018-03-12 15:24:47 Many of your stocks are working...would you enter WB on this slight pullback?
1294 2018-03-12 15:24:43 You have backed off everything so far. Need to fix NICS checks. Bump stocks as Class 3. Combat training takes years, not gonna happen. No rent-a-roaches poised as "armed guards" need combat trained officers rotating in and out. Trump promises are 100% nonsense lies.
1295 2018-03-12 15:24:24 But you are taking gun rights away from law abiding people!! I'll give up my bump stocks if they take away freedom of the (fake news!!) press!!
1296 2018-03-12 15:24:23 Bump stocks are “done.”  He lies more than he tells the truth.
1297 2018-03-12 15:24:05 Like yea Donald Stump Trump is a weak man. He has a school age child. On some real talk how many inner city schools has had a shooting. It is about money and access to purchase AR-15, bump stocks. Trump is about money just think how much he has made while in office.

1303 2018-03-12 15:23:31 There is litteraly no way to regulate bump stocks. With 3d printers becoming cheaper by the day.

1307 2018-03-12 15:21:20 Why do you have to wait on background checks? Should have been done long ago. Same for bump stocks. Why leave age limits to the states? Are kids in one state more or less able than in other states? Does the 2nd Amendment apply to the states differently?
1308 2018-03-12 15:21:19 Bump stocks are just a gimmick to a semi auto rifle. You don’t need one to fire rapid rate.
1309 2018-03-12 15:21:11 I agree. The "Assault Weapons" ban of 2018 like it's predecessors ban features. Collapsible butt-stocks, flash suppressors, pistol grips, and forwards grips to be specific. I don't like there is a constitutional right to those features. 1/

1323 2018-03-12 15:15:09 Piers. Stop the BS ... Trump is backing Background checks banning bump stocks and securing schools. It’s obvious you like a country with no guns and you have one.      GO THERE!!
1324 2018-03-12 15:14:58 Hate to burst your bubble but banning bump stocks will not keep bump stocks from the hands of criminals. Increasing background checks assume that shooters are buying their guns from gun shops and trade shows. Tried all this with drugs, how’s that working?

1347 2018-03-12 15:11:18 We want bans on these semi autos & bump stocks cause people are dying. Also cause studies show that more guns do not make citizens safer.  That is why we dont live in the wild west. Massacres stop when these guns are not available. That is why the NRA stops studies that prove it
1348 2018-03-12 15:11:08 Great! Only half of that stuff will actually work to deter would-be shooters. Banning bump fire stocks will not go over well with your base. And strengthening backgrounds will be just as ineffective, if the people who are supposed to conduct them fail to do their job.
1349 2018-03-12 15:10:29 What a weird trading day. My stocks are up and down by 2+%. No clear market direction, just kinda all over the place.
1350 2018-03-12 15:10:15 Schools aren’t the only places where shootings occurred. Some have happened where guns are allowed. More guns is not the answer. Adequate, safe controls will work. Background checks, a waiting period, raising the buying age to 21. Outlaw bump stocks. Be a leader Donnie Boy.

1360 2018-03-12 15:05:57 Banning bump-stocks won't even stop the use of devices like that.

1367 2018-03-12 15:04:28 Yeah...

You keep on saying "bump stocks will soon be out" and yet you've not yet lifted a pinky to make it happen.

How many days has it been since #LasVegasShooting again?

1479 2018-03-12 14:30:39 Trump is a gun grabber. He rolls back Obama-era EPA regs, but will add to Obama-era gun control measures. He'll ban bump stocks, something Obama didn't do, and he'll probably raise the age of purchase. Why isn't Trump undoing Obama's gun control executive orders?

1503 2018-03-12 14:22:04 Bump stocks were used in Vegas in Oct. Still nothing done. Why, because you decided to handle as regulation which is what NRA wanted.

1521 2018-03-12 14:16:38 Something is wrong here. Even after #Sensex posting biggest intra-day gain, infusion of ₹1000 cr few days back, the stocks of this company are on a decline. Not a path of roses for some.
1522 2018-03-12 14:16:27 I support strengthening background checks and the removal of bump stocks, but I do not support arming educators. That is not a solution to gun violence. There are so many scenarios where the gun would still get into the wrong hands and cause massive devastation.

1559 2018-03-12 14:07:52 Bump stocks aren’t the problem. Guns aren’t the problem. Maybe you should address the broken mental health system and the society that pumps kids full of brain altering drugs instead of parenting. You know. The drugs that help cause the mental health issues.
1560 2018-03-12 14:07:41 Bump stocks are useless. Putting them in any legislation is pretty disappointing
1561 2018-03-12 14:07:33 We have never said we want to repeal the Second Aendent and it is only idiots like you that try to keep that lie going. Common sense gun control is what we want. Better background checks, no assault rifles or bump stocks.
1562 2018-03-12 14:07:02 A label. So what? Just like bump stocks were ok because they only "simulated" automatic fire. Another label that killed a bunch of people.
1563 2018-03-12 14:06:53 The BIG PRIZE --  END of GUN FREE Zones;  arming schools.

1565 2018-03-12 14:06:35 Why ban bump stocks though? No proof the Vegas shooter used one. His fire rate was way too consistent to be a hokey gimmicky bump stock. I agree with the rest.
1566 2018-03-12 14:06:33 A lot of stocks broke their downtrending resistance lines today, closing above is crucial and very bullish
1567 2018-03-12 14:05:37 background checks, forbidden bump-stocks, armed teachers, faith in God - all this will not help the US: The killing will continue - not only at schools ...

1568 2018-03-12 14:05:33 Okay. Once that happens, I'll give you credit for the background checks and the Bump Stocks. Arming teachers not so much.
1569 2018-03-12 14:05:00 He is detracting from the real issue of guns so making it about the age the bumb stocks background checks and mental illness and people buying into it

1571 2018-03-12 14:04:27 Bump stocks aren’t the problem. No laws for the law abiding
1572 2018-03-12 14:04:15 Bump stocks will be out until a court educates you on the law. You can’t say something is legal to own and purchase, then turn around and ban it. Good luck

1578 2018-03-12 14:02:29 Still no real gun control then? Armed teachers? Give me a break. A hand gun goes up against an automatic weapon. What about all those who already own bump stocks? How many rushing out to buy  before banned as you tweet? SUCH A LOSER AND NO CLUE ABOUT ANYTHING.
1579 2018-03-12 14:02:26 Pay attention to the countries with established gun control.  Wake Up America.  Greedy, money-making effort for the NRA.  Consider when the second amendment was written and what it really meant.  A single shot musket?  Not bump stocks, automatic rifles....
1580 2018-03-12 14:02:04 See the thing is with a brain is that even if you band bump stocks their is some inventor out there that just has that idea for a type of bump fire that will Loop right through future existing laws. Gun control solves problems also makes them it just never goes away.
1581 2018-03-12 14:01:45 No one is “killing” the “2A”. Who’s telling you that? Banning bump stocks, large capacity magazines and assault type rifles, requiring stricter background checks, does nothing to the Second Amendment. You still get your guns if you’re a honest citizen. Just not all kinds.
1582 2018-03-12 14:01:45 So the bump stock manufacturer sells the pieces parts of a bump stock as individual pieces. Did a ban on selling bump stocks stop the buyer from assembling her own bump stock?

1631 2018-03-12 13:47:41 Actually it's dangerous to generalize valuation of stocks. Not all are available at discount rate in bear market and not all are expensive at bull market. It is the game of finding those hidden gems available at cheap prices in any market.

1641 2018-03-12 13:44:56 The bump stocks are just something to make people who don’t understand fire arms feel better.  Raising age to 21 has a host of problems and won’t solve the problem.  But appreciate your leadership on the areas that can make a difference.
1642 2018-03-12 13:44:49 You make it sound like care about bump stocks but said this a couple weeks ago “A bump stock, you shoot rapidly but not accurately, The bullets come out fast, but you don’t know where the hell they’re going. That’s why nobody even really, too much, came to its defense”
1643 2018-03-12 13:44:35 Why don't African people invest in start-ups?

1648 2018-03-12 13:44:06 Sucha mistake to ban bump stocks.
1649 2018-03-12 13:43:43 @realDonaldTrump Bump Stocks may well go to the Supremes as it looks like an infringement of an individuals right to bear arms
1650 2018-03-12 13:43:38 Will it be illegal to possess bump stocks?
1651 2018-03-12 13:43:16 More political push and pull in #Washington under @Trump than ever before. They got it in bump stocks or is that spades?
1652 2018-03-12 13:43:09 Pres Trump tweets: " Legislation moving forward. Bump Stocks will soon be out. Teachers will be allowed to conceal carry, subject to State Law.
18 to 21 Age Limits? States are making this decision. Not much political support (to put it mildly). NOTE: School safety plan on Sunday
1653 2018-03-12 13:42:59 Bump Stocks had nothing to do with any mass shooting, and that include Las Vegas.  It is just a political stunt to appease the gun-grabbing left.  Politicians should be worried about their base instead.
1654 2018-03-12 13:42:52 What happened to your promise to ban bump stocks? Did the NRA intimidate you out of that. It should be a no brainer. What argument did the NRA use to justify the sale of a device that converts a leagal weapon to an illegal one?
1655 2018-03-12 13:42:47 Facts matter: Guns- Florida just passed a law to increase age of purchase is 21,banned bump stocks, closed background check loophole, etc! TRUMP NOW OPPOSES INCREASING THE AGE Of GUN PURCHASE! And to add insult to injury PUT DUMMER THAN DUM BETSY DEVOS IN CHARGE OF THIS ISSUE!
1656 2018-03-12 13:41:50 No. We need metal detectors and ban on bump stocks and the war on illegal gun and drugs.

1662 2018-03-12 13:40:31 Hi Danielle - yes, our Wokingham shop stocks it. Item code 490836.
1663 2018-03-12 13:40:24 Your facts are all wrong! The NRA doesn’t want a ban on bump stocks. Also, it’s Congress’ decision, not Trumps. He is simply reminding people that progress is being made.

1665 2018-03-12 13:40:02 What we say: "We want common sense gun laws, and a ban on assault rifles, and bump stocks."

What they hear: "We're coming for your guns."

Seriously, listen to us. We. Are. NOT. Coming. For. Your. Guns.
1666 2018-03-12 13:39:26 Background checks were already in place. Bump stocks don't come into it.
Every eligible citizen should be allowed to carry at schools. Teachers should be trained and encouraged to carry. In high school there should be a mandatory subject where students are taught firearms.
1667 2018-03-12 13:39:22 @realDonaldTrump What is your Plan for People who have already purchased Slide Fire Bump Stocks? I Assume those who Already Own The Devices will still be able to Keep them? What is Your Plan for the 30+ People in Small Texas Town that Slide Fire is it's Only Employer?
1668 2018-03-12 13:39:13 bump stocks aren't the problem, it's the heartless cowards that's the problem! Too scared to fight like a man
1669 2018-03-12 13:38:56 Good morning Mr President. Today’s seems like a good day to:

- Release your Tax Returns
- Impose sanctions on Russia
- Sign reg banning bump stocks
- Address the Nation’s Opioid Crisis
1670 2018-03-12 13:38:44 Some could say that is exactly the same way you are reacting to ban bump stocks and grabbing our guns under the the guise of mental illness...

1672 2018-03-12 13:37:48 Stocks are soaring, but wages aren't  going up, what does that mean? Since the average #American doesn't own stock, they're getting nothing!
1673 2018-03-12 13:37:36 "We have lost our ability to filter what is important and what is not. Psychologists call this decision fatigue. It is ever so obvious in #stocks investment world where more than 80% what you hear and see is noise" - Jae at old school value
1674 2018-03-12 13:36:49 I dissagree with the banning of so called bump stocks all one needs is a short 2x4 and a 1/2 wood dowel and it will work on "any" semi-Auto pistol, or rifle but its still one pull, one fire! It's still not full auto where one pull expells multiple rounds!
1675 2018-03-12 13:36:41 $RKDA is getting squeezed just like $INNT $ZSAN and $TENX. People just buying stocks with ridiculous spreads.

1689 2018-03-12 13:31:19 In the end, we get nothing at the federal level...not even the promised “I will ban bump stocks myself”. Just like Sandy Hook. Nothing will change until everyone hooked on #NRABloodMoney is gone.
1690 2018-03-12 13:31:03 The Las Vegas bump stock mass shooting was 162 days ago, liar/racist in chief. Since then you've played golf on 32 of those days. Easy to see how you're saying only now that bump stocks "will soon be out." BTW: grammatically it should be "will be out soon" or "soon will be out."
1691 2018-03-12 13:30:59 Although most of the replies will be negative.. very happy to see progress being made somewhere in the middle. The NRA doesn’t want to ban bump stocks, and therefore Trump by no means is “listening to the NRA.”
1692 2018-03-12 13:30:41 Double delight for economy. Inflation in Feb comes in lower than expected at 4.44% (economists expected 4.7%); Industrial Growth in Jan at 7.5% better than economists expectn of 6.6%.  Expect bonds and stocks to rise tomorrow
1693 2018-03-12 13:30:11 Other than Bump Stocks, POTUS' posture on military-type weapon  restrictions (for lack of a better word) is increasingly flacid.   Where's the firm stance we saw after Parkland?
1694 2018-03-12 13:30:02 Don’t let the NRA call the shots, @realDonaldTrump. Ban assault weapons of mass destruction, high capacity magazines, bump stocks and improve background checks. Show you reall care about kids.

1702 2018-03-12 13:28:55 Background checks are useless and outlawing bump stocks is equally dumb. But arming the willing school staff members should’ve been done long ago!
1703 2018-03-12 13:28:53 LOL, let us all know when Ryan & McConnell choose to let any of that come to the floor.  Including bump stocks, which the NRA considers *essential* to, you know, American freedom ;)

Just like that bill you signed last year *allowing the mentally ill to buy guns*.  Because NRA ;)
1704 2018-03-12 13:28:45 And bump stocks? Where is the exec order?
1705 2018-03-12 13:28:45 background checks, forbidden bump-stocks, armed teachers, faith in God - all this will not help the US: The killing will continue - not only at schools ...
and why? asks @potus & @NRA (their response: votes !!!) you‘ll need a lot of prayers!!!
1706 2018-03-12 13:28:37 Bump stocks must be banned through legislation, not executive action. See: Obama administration. So if you’re serious, back the legislation.

1719 2018-03-12 13:26:21 Vegas was 5 months ago. Why are bump stocks still available?
1720 2018-03-12 13:26:04 yep.  and, most likely, something else will replace "bump stocks" within the year.

1724 2018-03-12 13:25:12 Teachers should teach not kill people. They need more books not bullets. If we raise the age to 21 for buying assault weapons, strengthen background check, do away with bump stocks,etc. we will go a long way to cutting down of the school shootings

Although we might be wrong, we the new rally phases thesis because of following reasons:
1734 2018-03-12 13:23:16 Bump stocks are worthless for rifle makes them harder to control. Trained brave CHL carriers in schools to help protect our children from evil people who do not care about laws and life. #2A #CHL #NRA all help protect our safety and  Rights.
1735 2018-03-12 13:23:10 The only thing strong is your bullshit.  You won't meet with Kim.  You baked off raising age to by firearms. Bump stocks are a long way from being outlawed.  Teachers don't want to carry guns. And you are NOT making America great.
1736 2018-03-12 13:23:09 NOT GOOD ENOUGH!  STOP listening to Mrs and listen to the rest of the American people! Raise age limit, ban bump stocks and assault rifles!! TEACHERS SHOULD NOT BE ARMED!! #fakepresident

1738 2018-03-12 13:22:52 You do no have the authority to ban bump stocks, clearly a violation of the 2A, along with all your other gun control ideas.
1739 2018-03-12 13:22:38 The Las Vegas Lie was to get the bump stocks. Very disappointed. QAnon is a smoke screen.
1740 2018-03-12 13:22:16 Well done but don't go full Saddam with teacher human shields but i may not like you but glad to see your doing the right thing regards bump stocks + full background checks

1742 2018-03-12 13:22:04 Back ground checks don't work and bump stocks should remain legal.
1743 2018-03-12 13:22:03 Bump stocks being banned is a sop to irrational gun control cabal. Banning bump stocks won't do a thing to stop mass killings. What about fuel oil and fertilizer for building bombs? How about large trucks or fast cars? D.C. plays foolish games. All we can do is shake our heads!

1764 2018-03-12 13:20:09 Big mistake. Bump-stocks are not a problem. A CRIMINAL can modify a rifle in seconds to fire full-auto. Further infringing on law-abiding citizens' rights doesn't stop crime. You are alienating your entire base. The only answer is arming our schools, not infringing on the 2nd!!
1765 2018-03-12 13:19:58 The sensible aproach, arming teachers doesnt seem a great idea, just keeping cops around would do the work, but yes we need more background checks, maybe banning bump stocks was a bit extreme, maybe they could be the ones to have a age restriction
1766 2018-03-12 13:19:53 Oil is still blindly following stocks. We need those dimwits to go away.
1767 2018-03-12 13:19:53 Clearly armed guards aren’t a deturant. Arming teachers is stupid. Bump stocks wow, so brave if you, what happens to the age limit and assault rifle ban?oh that’s right you had lunch with the nra and then caved instantly. That’s right. After you blamed senators of the same haha

1769 2018-03-12 13:19:46 What will banning bump stocks help? How many people will be out of work from it? Things that attach to a firearm do not make it more dangerous. The person pulling the trigger is the dangerous part. #NRA #MAGA #bumpstocks

1970 2018-03-12 12:04:12 False. Actually, every single one of those assertions are incorrect. Unemployment is the same. (Obama brought it down.) Next, only your withholding went down. The uneducated think it’s a raise. Last, “stocks” (you mean equities, not stocks) have lost value after buybacks.

Also look at binary triggers, they are another gray area accessory that actually scares me, huge potential for a accidental discharge.

I'd rather have the market decide the stocks are more valuable based on company growth prospects and it's strategy.

2099 2018-03-12 10:30:45 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.

2121 2018-03-12 10:08:52 trump backs down; reneges on raising the gun law age from 18 to 21 years of age. Next: Never pushed on banning Bump Stocks used on automatic rifles (e.g., AR-15). Lie after lie. No defense for American youth in schools. A RENEGING trump. All mouth no action. BAD!
2122 2018-03-12 10:08:43 Mr Trump please don't go forward with more gun restrictions.  Bump stocks are gimmicks you may as well ban my trigger finger because it itself is a rate of fire increaser...

2249 2018-03-12 08:14:51 Loss aversion can create a myriad of investment problems, it gets us to sell winning stocks too quickly—we don’t want to lose those gains!—and keep losing ones too long—because we don’t want to realize the loss on those stocks.

2274 2018-03-12 07:35:04 Most of the #bearmarkets start because of investors expectations. They first build so many expectations into the price that whenever they see a slight risk to their excessive expectations getting materialized, they panic and dump the stocks.

2282 2018-03-12 07:21:04 It’s good. We want FIIs to reduce their stake so that Indians make money in Indian stocks. Why create wealth for foreigners?
2283 2018-03-12 07:20:46 Banning hump stocks is good, but it’s not addressing the root of the problem. Not even fucking close.
2284 2018-03-12 07:19:33 I’ve yet to set up my account for my amazon stocks I’m fucking up lol
2285 2018-03-12 07:16:12 So, how does reducing bump stocks reduce homicides? Do we have ANY data studying guns and their harm on public health? My point is that bump stock regs are meaningless. Our administration will 'check the box' on the gun legislation least likely to effect change.
2286 2018-03-12 07:15:16 The was cnbc Analyst give buy n sell call with targets as if they have trained these stocks n they will move as per their orders. This is circus
2287 2018-03-12 07:14:06 Well based on raising equity for a start could be done on an a purely mathematical basis derived from statistics derived by the AEC, ABS and ATO. So the Public service only have to change the printer toners and paper stocks. Make it PDF based and we solve that problem.

2488 2018-03-12 04:10:47 Get States and local Governments to put laws on the books against bump stocks and raising the age to buy guns.They will go bankrupt filing lawsuits everywhere.They ARE the danger to the 2nd Amendment.
2489 2018-03-12 04:09:58 1. We are the only country where mass shootings are a problem.
2. We are the only country where gun violence is so commonplace. 
3. Other countries have successful bans of assault rifles and bump stocks and have no mass shootings.
2490 2018-03-12 04:09:43 Cathy, I am a gun owner and a staunch advocate for the second amendment. That said, banning bump stocks is pointless if your goal was to save children. Just using them puts a damper on their accuracy anyway. We have 3D machines which can make homemade bump stocks without issue.

2499 2018-03-12 04:00:13 Nobody is talking about confiscation. Last I checked the ask was a universal background check, raising the age, bump stocks & getting rid of assault style. Mentioning Australia doesn't mean 'do it just like Australia'

2516 2018-03-12 03:47:31 Yes sir, just the avg investor doesn't know how to get in on PPs I would think. Most avg people don't even know how to buy stocks.  Also PPs normally come with a pretty high minimum.

2520 2018-03-12 03:44:36 Did you not see President Trump offers his support in raising the age to 21 for all guns? They won't show that on CNN or MSNBC. I believe he also said no bump stocks also. He's trying!!! Give him a break ffs.
2521 2018-03-12 03:43:48 No ONE WANTS TO REPEAL THE 2ND AMENDMENT!!!

2535 2018-03-12 03:31:45 That's true. What he inherited invested in S&P stocks would have yielded more.
2536 2018-03-12 03:31:01 Outlaw bump stocks.  Limit ammo of rifles to 5 (ARs or any models).  Increase age to own a rifle to 21.  Most impt of all do psych check and interview before issuing a permit.

2542 2018-03-12 03:27:57 Yet the responses have been ban the AR15, raise the age to buy a rifle to 21, ban bump stocks, and give more govt control on background checks.

2545 2018-03-12 03:21:47 This sector is now the riskiest or wildest play bc so many variables are yet to be resolved.  I mean, you may be better off buying CRISPR or gene therapy stocks even if they are at all time highs.   Just thinking about next week makes me want to drink.
2546 2018-03-12 03:21:36 If you're 21 and drive for uber for 2 hours a day for a year, make $15 a hour and save every dollar, you would have around 11k by the end of the year. If you would invest that 11k in stocks for 7% compound return, in 50 years, you would have around 300k.
2547 2018-03-12 03:19:58 And the ban on bump stocks?
2548 2018-03-12 03:18:49 Nice post. I never buy stocks on IPO day, regardless of what they are. And you outlined the reason why!
2549 2018-03-12 03:17:51 This one i disagree with you. Bump stocks have no practical hunting or self defence function.

2601 2018-03-12 02:29:13 I think the NRA would be ok with people telling drug attics, the mentally ill & criminals to buy the semi automatic & bump stocks to break into homes.  They are all about anyone getting a gun. Then when you use yours they can use theirs.  Old western shoot out.

2604 2018-03-12 02:26:46 Coming home for spring break had been so relaxing. My dad asked me about good long term stocks. I told him $USRM $BYOC $IMUC $IDXG and $INPX I tried to convince him $BTC $LTC $ETH are the future. He is just too old fashioned I guess.

2606 2018-03-12 02:26:29 Are bump stocks that commonly owned? I think I'd rather see them as class 3 than noise suppressors.

2615 2018-03-12 02:15:25 Believe bump stocks and "assult weapons" are going to be tried in an upcoming bill.
2616 2018-03-12 02:13:17 Bump stocks weren't in this most recent bill. Raising the legal age to own a gun to 21 is why the NRA filed suite.

2640 2018-03-12 01:56:18 Perhaps the message to the criminals should be buy bump stocks and semi autos when breaking in homes. Thats not used but perhaps it needs to be to stop you & your excuse to have them. People don't use them to break in yet you say you need them to defend your homes.
2641 2018-03-12 01:55:50 I'd like you to explain to me how he's a bad president? He tweets? Who cares. Everything he does is good for the country and anyone in business or dealing in stocks should be shining his shoes. Dealing with NK with diplomacy like people asked for? He's doing it. Etc, etc.

2644 2018-03-12 01:52:29 This idiot @GerberKawasaki is an investment advisor! Really? Must be one of those who advised his clients to sell their stocks & get out of the market. Otherwise he is a hypocrite! Lets Retweet him especially on his feed so we will help him get more clients. Who's with me?
2645 2018-03-12 01:52:07 How about keeping tax (because suppliers will simply raise the price to consumers' proven ability to pay if nixed) and redirect funds for freely available stocks in public toilets, schools, etc ?

2650 2018-03-12 01:48:03 Yes. Small gains. I purchased some penny stocks that I plan on sitting on for years.
2651 2018-03-12 01:47:56 @realvision It might be a great idea to do a serious or at least a podcast on how stocks have done so many buy backs, the implications and who has done the most based on their size of company.  Could be a good way to actually accurately calculate their PE.

2657 2018-03-12 01:44:53 Just ran across a "financial advisor" in CA who's a obnoxious Trump hater. Wonder if he advised his clients to sell their stocks. I lost the tweet but when I find it I am going to help make him famous by asking him that question. Help him drum up some business. Who's with me?

2673 2018-03-12 01:25:57 I also feel like using stocks/ packs is what limits new designers to such low level work, they rely on the stocks too much and end up just making one big pile of stock vomit.
2674 2018-03-12 01:25:50 Noticed most of the gap up stocks I was following were in biotech or related, now to figure out how to set up the scanner to catch the runners when the volume is just starting up instead off, my broker doesn't have them to short usually. Soooo much to learn, Love it!
2675 2018-03-12 01:25:07 Sure. Didn’t the Donald call him l’il Marco? LOL. People like different things. Personally the words #ShallNotBeInfringed are among my favorites.

2681 2018-03-12 01:18:15 ......and it shouldn't be on the streets. Why do you think GOP won't even ban bump stocks? Hundreds in Vegas payed with their lives. GOP is bought/paid for.
2682 2018-03-12 01:18:11 Did he sign EO banning bump stocks? he promised to do that
2683 2018-03-12 01:17:13 But not saddened enough to change any of the gun laws.....minimum age, banning bump stocks, banning assault weapons, increasing background checks......all have relatively little impact on the 2nd amendment but could save lives. Your words are MEANINGLESS
2684 2018-03-12 01:15:33 Do liberals think Trump should follow Obama's lead on gun control? Oh wait he did nothing on gun control other than legalize bump stocks.
2685 2018-03-12 01:12:52 While stocks last.
2686 2018-03-12 01:11:55 And you STILL have not said which amendment protects TOOLS, because "bump stocks" can't hold bullets to fire like a gun does.
BANNING ARs, Glocks or any other gun "just because" they are [insert stupid reason] they claim THAT WOULD BE against the amendment. But not age or TOOLS.
2687 2018-03-12 01:11:49 If you consider that he wants to raise the gun buy age to 21 and wants to ban bump stocks...
2688 2018-03-12 01:10:51 Disney will use the massive tax cuts to buy back their own stocks. You're no Christian, snowflake.

2691 2018-03-12 01:03:10 Baby steps lead to larger steps. There is more than just school safety but public safety in general. For example raising age, ban bump stocks or have you forgot about 58 dead at Las Vegas.  Oohhh that’s right, NRA did offer prayers and condolences and NOTHING else.

2699 2018-03-12 00:57:48 There is a LOT of dumb money on Twitter that is bearish on stocks and took it personally after February's shakeout.

2706 2018-03-12 00:53:15 Exactly.   Just looking at the Friday tape, lots of downtick sells for 10k shares or less.

2712 2018-03-12 00:46:22 My point of quoting Governor Scott is that of the membership of the NRA hold views such as yours and there are those that have the views of Scott- such as raise age from 18 to 21, and 3 day waiting .  Also more states as well as federal government taking a look at bump stocks.
2713 2018-03-12 00:45:54 Im not being nasty. The NRA is getting a bad rap because nobody knows who to blame. Its not NRA. They are all in with valid nix checks and the wrong ppl having guns. And getting rid of bump stocks Plus training.

2723 2018-03-12 00:39:25 This guy is an investor, but biting the hand that made the 40% uptake in stocks=@POTUS .

Him and Clinton cut from same swamp.
2724 2018-03-12 00:38:14 No apologies necessary. Fuck people with their “just get over it” tweets!
2725 2018-03-12 00:37:43 @BWalk007 @bgd2 I post very little compared to other people... I don’t post 10,000 stocks a day... That’s the difference between ME and THEY
2726 2018-03-12 00:36:42 To jo, smerem dopredu se mu neda nic uprit, ale jak da spatnou prihravku a souper zautoci, tak hru uplne vypousti ... nekolikrat se nevratil se svym hracem, ve srovnani s ostatnimi je to strasne moc videt ... ale i diky tomu to bylo do konce napinave, jestli Petr Cech da nulu ;)
2727 2018-03-12 00:36:17 I hope you didn't expect 'Ms Beet' to have the guts to go into an idea battle.  There are no bump stocks to help her in a battle where she has no ammo.

2729 2018-03-12 00:34:49 @stx_coin you can earn by prediction. It is a great platform to earn where you only need to predict in a current events or stocks. You can also earn by doing bounty task.
2730 2018-03-12 00:34:11 If the Ivy League brainiacs who get paid stupid money to rate the easiest stocks in the market don't throw out some Upgrades in the morning then they're more useless than we originally thought. $AMZN $NFLX $GOOGL $BKNG
2731 2018-03-12 00:33:53 According to your profile, you're into stocks? Wall Street is doing very well under @POTUS. I bet President Trump put more money in your bank account, am I correct? You're an ingrate bastard.
2732 2018-03-12 00:33:44 Obama = longest stretch of economic and job growth in US history. Stocks tripled. Some destruction, Comrade Deplorable.
2733 2018-03-12 00:32:52 Ok, but legally carrying owners don't need an assault rifle with extended clips, or bump stocks.
2734 2018-03-12 00:32:49 It’s not video games
It’s not age restrictions 
It’s not mental health
It’s not background checks
It’s not bump stocks
IT’S AUTOMATIC WEAPONS IN THE HANDS OF CITIZENS 
BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS NOW

2735 2018-03-12 00:32:22 Playing with these stocks trying to flip it
2736 2018-03-12 00:30:57 Kids = not much experience about how things work + exaggerated sense of their own importance. Bump stocks and a (temporary, unconstitutional) age requirement is all you’re going to get. So...pretty much nothing.
2737 2018-03-12 00:30:02 And bump stocks are not accurate at all. Military m-16s usually stay on a 3 round burst for accuracy reasons. I for one won't get a bump stock, but others like them for range time.
2738 2018-03-12 00:30:02 I don't think about financial success as the measurement of my success. #tradeforex #stocks
2739 2018-03-12 00:29:12 Can we agree on universal background checks that have no holes? Or on limiting high-capacity magazines? Or on keeping guns from convicted domestic abusers? Or on banning bump stocks? We don't want your handgun. Can we start somewhere though? Is there any common ground?
2740 2018-03-12 00:29:02 Raising the age? No bump stocks? Taking away guns then asking questions? Lol are you blind? I'm not!
2741 2018-03-12 00:28:50 Steady on. The science of this matter says that the industry needs thorough reform.   When some stocks are crashing several time per decade, and reproductive rates in some fish lower, we're not about to enter an era of bonanza for UK boats. -Would be just as disastrous as CAP.
2742 2018-03-12 00:28:15 LOL - so you cant afford shares of $JPM yet traders are supposed to respect your advice on #OTC stocks like $TPAC?

2743 2018-03-12 00:27:16 Jobs, stocks, companies coming back. Supreme Court. Illegal immigration reform. Doing exactly what he ran on. What would you like him to do.

2746 2018-03-12 00:23:17 I  agree with stepping up the background checks & bump stocks. But leave the age to buy a gun @ 18! That’s the legal age to vote & enter the military! Mental illness is what needs to be addressed! There’s much more to the Parkland, FL shooting than meets the eye! @potus @tedcruz
2747 2018-03-12 00:20:05 I just assumed from how well you did with the stocks you wouldn’t need a day job.
2748 2018-03-12 00:19:33 Solution #1 No Gun 'Til 21
Solution #2 background check for EVERY SALE (no loophole for person to person sales or gunshows)
Solution #3 no armor piercing rounds, no hollow point rounds, no bump stocks, no high capacity weapons
2749 2018-03-12 00:18:33 Were all on the same $uav team! Woohoo
2750 2018-03-12 00:18:08 Lol someone is happy lol
2751 2018-03-12 00:17:46 Export capacity is increasing, so it will be interesting to see how this impacts stocks, long term.  In many ways, between nascent state of US-TO prod, and nascent export paradigm, I think the market is in a yet to be defined phase.
2752 2018-03-12 00:17:34 @TuurDemeester , Stage 1 is going for ten to twelve years I think. These are the growth years in which bitcoin outperforms most or all traditional investments. Stage 3 is when it’s a currency and underperforms traditional stocks, yet replaces fiat and remains deflationary.
2753 2018-03-12 00:17:29 We all watched you say you were for raising the age for rifles, banning bump stocks and saying no to the NRA. That’s the real FAKE NEWS!
2754 2018-03-12 00:16:09 Smart man. Not even bump stocks
2755 2018-03-12 00:15:34 Rejecting stocks and mutual funds to own the libs
2756 2018-03-12 00:15:14 Banning bump stocks is useless. You can 3D print them.
2757 2018-03-12 00:14:59 N u know big companies..they just want the stocks to increase..so they will do anything to make that happen..even by harassing or overworking their artists
2758 2018-03-12 00:14:47 If you ban bump stocks I won’t vote for you in 2020 or support Flake & the republicans in 2018.
2759 2018-03-12 00:13:44 You are a slave of the words you speak, but you are a master of your thoughts.

2765 2018-03-12 00:10:11 The impartial CBO disagrees.  
Almost 90% of Americans benefit directly.
Approximately 55% own stocks and benefit again as the cuts boost the market.
An unknown percentage will gain jobs from the boom.

Have @NancyPelosi repeat her elitist “crumbs” comment.  
#outoftouch
2766 2018-03-12 00:09:54 At least with bump stocks, hi-cap mags, semi-auto, etc. I get the argument. Go ahead and try and make an argument for the "assault weapon" features that only exist for aesthetics and ergonomics (see: "so it shoots straight" or "so it's harder to drop") warrant "assault weapon"
2767 2018-03-12 00:09:54 This could be a crazy big week to the upside for stocks. Crazy big. Shorts that hadn't already covered began doing so on Friday. Now they'll be flipping to the buyside, adding to the tens of billions in fresh money pouring into US stocks from all over the world. #VRA #long
2768 2018-03-12 00:09:12 I’m going to read through this again but at first glance it looks like a lot punting and no real change outside of possibly bump stocks.
2769 2018-03-12 00:06:44 Asia stocks begin the week positive following last Friday's Wall St gains and as region reacts to US jobs data, in which NFP smashed expectations & wage growth slowed which spurred a goldilocks environment; ASX 200 (+0.8%), Nikkei 225 (+2.2%), KOSPI (+0.8%)

2775 2018-03-12 00:03:38 And clemson and FSU by 20 and Arizona
2776 2018-03-12 00:03:31 Just saw a Tweet that Zuckerberg unloaded hundreds of millions worth of stocks; not sure if it is true.
2777 2018-03-12 00:02:42 Your right but if the Ncstate team that beat Unc and duke shoes up y’all could upset a couple of teams
2778 2018-03-12 00:02:24 Voluntary confrontation is the best self-help.

2779 2018-03-12 00:02:14 Not surprised that the vastly inept DeVos supports it . She has never set foot in a classroom probably has stocks in gun companies and her brother is behind blackwater. Reeks of possible conflict of interest
2780 2018-03-12 00:01:36 We have an awful bracket
2781 2018-03-12 00:01:14 I’m anxious to see how far Unc can go
2782 2018-03-12 00:01:12 No, Don, you’ve deflected so far away I had to reread the thread to remember where we came from. Insulting someone’s intelligence is no way to get good conversation from them. Either state your point about guns/bump stocks or this is the end of the line for us.
2783 2018-03-12 00:00:48 We might end up playing them. Excited to see how Markell matches up on D against him if we play them.
