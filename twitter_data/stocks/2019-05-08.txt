1 2019-05-08 23:58:06 I'm not actively trading forex. I'm trading futures, stocks and options. I generally look for new highs to go long a stock or futures contract and look for high IV when using an option selling strategy.
2 2019-05-08 23:55:48 You pay your taxes faithfully every year. Kids don’t have any student loans and wages have increased. Got yours guns back that Obama took from you. And your elderly parents don’t have to worry about their Medicare prices raising cause they have their pension invested in stocks.
3 2019-05-08 23:55:45 If you want to be a better long-term investor get rid of all distractions that promote short-term thinking. Listening to financial pundits, watching your positions every trading day, and watching hundreds of other stocks that you would never own at any price are big distractions.

7 2019-05-08 23:53:29 Tariffs raise the cost of goods in stores. The #Trump companies knowing in advance when #tariffs will be imposed, buy & sell various stocks ahead of the announcement. When it comes time to lower tariffs again, #Trump & family will benefit while we all pay more. @SethAbramson

9 2019-05-08 23:52:16 Let me spell this out for you. There is a strike in the first place because the workers have been getting pay cuts. It just so happens that this one was the final straw because the pay cuts are for stocks
10 2019-05-08 23:51:41 I think it may depend on how other markets do. If stocks struggle bc of Trump China drama, then there may be less appetite for risk, and we may hang out at 6K-ish for awhile. If stocks go up, profits may flow into $BTC.. I've had us conservatively at $8K by yr end since last yr.

14 2019-05-08 23:49:24 Obama just seized all your guns. Obama the radical is going to seize all of America's Conservative 2nd Ammendment white people's guns. First he seized our bump stocks and now this. We told you.  What's that? Not Obama? Nope, Trump.

16 2019-05-08 23:48:45 Options on stocks are not much different, except that they normally have the added advantage of being tradable.
17 2019-05-08 23:48:40 Once I found out that Uber and Lyft paid their workers less for the stocks, I stopped using it already.
