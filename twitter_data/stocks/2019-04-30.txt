1 2019-04-30 23:57:31 McRib returns stocks should dump. Personally I would dump all my holdings to buy McRibs.
2 2019-04-30 23:56:26 Seeing some heat in dividend stocks if you are into it. $jnj $ko $pm $nee $aep $clx $cl to name a few.
3 2019-04-30 23:56:12 I try not to bash anyone, as the market is tough enough.  I make an exception for BMM and BBP. as I was on both of there alert email lists and EVERY stock they emailed went down within 1-24 hours.  I have no problem with people that short stocks, but I have issues with deceit.
4 2019-04-30 23:56:05 The ones that aren’t hitting new highs perhaps. Russell, Dow, select stocks, stocks that recently dipped, etc. Higher risk ones like IPO’s, IBB, & MJ?
5 2019-04-30 23:55:44 Man I loved trading in the 30s. Prohibition ended in 1933 so we got all liquored up and bought all those hot department store stocks. Stock market rockets up 46.59%! The only downside was everyone was so hungover in 1934 that we got -1.19%. but 1935.....party was back on 
6 2019-04-30 23:55:02 Yesterday - Industry: #SOFTWARE & SERVICES was 15% Positive, with #NOT APPLIC 7% Positive. Stocks: $VEC was 18% Positive, with $SPX 9% Positive. #ASX

9 2019-04-30 23:54:19 They are guilty of subversive and fraud against a duly elected Pres, his staff, and  a National Election. They have lost their mind-even going after his grandchildren. But what of Podesta’s stocks from the Russian UR1 deal given his daughter? Oh, he is a democrat, I forgot
10 2019-04-30 23:53:15 Tech giant Alphabet reported a better than expected profit overnight but a slowing in sales growth has analysts concerned. Although the S&P500 and Dow Jones indices recorded modest gains the Nasdaq dropped as investors factored lower expectations for tech stocks. @MicMcCarthy_CMC
11 2019-04-30 23:52:42 All I’m saying is we didn’t have salem and even then I still didn’t even play in the crew battle and we had 5 stocks left

13 2019-04-30 23:52:00 I need to find a investment seminar for stocks.
14 2019-04-30 23:51:50 I'm pleased to have been stopped out of 3 or 4 issues this morning and still made good money on the day...almost made money long and short in same day...that's my favorite, but not quite.... #stocks $FFTY
