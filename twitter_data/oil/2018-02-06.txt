cooking a simple ham.

8 2018-02-06 23:58:14 Time for BC move aggressively away from oil by massively investing in the transportation choices that many people want: electric buses, rail and passenger ferries plus cycling and walking. Oil from anywhere is pretty bad for people’s health and the environment.

11 2018-02-06 23:57:34 I wonder how many lives would be saved if non-psychoactive #CBD oil was more available than #opioids here in #Florida.
12 2018-02-06 23:57:28 I hear coconut oil is great!! I'd love to try it...
13 2018-02-06 23:57:27 Look into oregano oil. It taste horrible  but it works
14 2018-02-06 23:57:09 No problem, it’s lowkey litt and adding cocoanut or Avocado oil it’s even better
15 2018-02-06 23:57:08 @Pennzoil @Mobil1 @jiffylube can you please tell me why Synthetic Oil Change prices are never listed? I need one and would prefer to come directly to you... but .... Sheeshh!
16 2018-02-06 23:57:04 The Koch bros. & Paul Ryan probably had a hand in this.  Ryan owns land w/ wells.  Father in law is oil executive. As long as oil investors run the gov't, we won't advance in alt. energy.

34 2018-02-06 23:56:57 I just spent 1 hr rubbing coconut oil into my lashes in an unsuccessful attempt to remove my extensions and now I look like an alien
35 2018-02-06 23:56:29 then why are oil spills taking place? the latest in January

37 2018-02-06 23:56:14 Things the US military can’t do:

- rescue people after natural disasters
- win a war

Things the US military do:

- make the world a less safe place
- emit tons of CO2
- threatens to end human life on this rock
- create terrorists
- keep oil and innocent people blood flowing
38 2018-02-06 23:56:09 If I don’t find my oil brushes in studio tomorrow I’m going to be pissed.
39 2018-02-06 23:56:08 My car got an oil change and new wipers

41 2018-02-06 23:55:58 Get a spray bottle with some coconut oil and Water or get some Cantu daily Moisturizer and Put it on yo hair every day
42 2018-02-06 23:55:58 Ugh. I feel bad that she’s taking it out on an industry that has nothing to do with oil and gas. One more reason as British Columbians we should support BC vineyards. I can easily do that 
43 2018-02-06 23:55:48 Alternate headline: "Chemical" is added to McD's frying oil to make sure it doesn't froth too much.
44 2018-02-06 23:55:37 WE could cut to the chase and just turn off their oil. That might gather their attention. #ableg
45 2018-02-06 23:55:35 Would rather that we move aggressively away from oil by massively investing in the transportation choices that many people want: electric buses, rail and passenger ferries plus cycling and walking. Oil from anywhere is pretty bad for people’s health and the environment.
46 2018-02-06 23:55:32 Alaskans own 1,164,878 shares of SAPURA ENERGY BHD, worth $479,060. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in MALAYSIA.
47 2018-02-06 23:55:28 First of all, Alberta makes more money from booze and cigarettes than it does from oil, largely because you fools keep believing the lies the oil companies tell you. Second of all we pay to educate your workers and to look after them when they come home hurt. (1/2)
48 2018-02-06 23:55:11 We roam ahead and turn out of where you see
I can’t hear the heart, this old oil stain
49 2018-02-06 23:55:10 I know!  The horror!

The only pizza I'm really into simply has olive oil and garlic as a base, a light sprinkle of parmesan, prosciutto and asparagus.

51 2018-02-06 23:54:48 People forget all the taxes that were on Oil and Gas products prior to the Carbon tax.  Did they ever reduce consumption?
52 2018-02-06 23:54:36 Gotta think about getting one.  Does food taste the same as a real oil fryer?
53 2018-02-06 23:54:31 lo mein noodles are less a food than a grease/oil/fat delivery service
54 2018-02-06 23:54:29 Biggest benefactors from BC NDP vs. Alberta NDP pipeline/wine bun fight? Offshore oil & wines made outside of Canada.  The sheer stupidity of NDP Governments never ceases to amaze. #bcpoli #ableg

61 2018-02-06 23:53:46 So it's OK for Alberta's Oil and Gas industry to pay a steep price for the lack of east-west pipelines, but not the wine industry?
62 2018-02-06 23:53:39 Not much...while we have a small refinery in Burnaby and crude oil and gas flowing in from Edmonton via Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain pipeline, the Lower Mainland actually depends on refineries in the U.S. for much of our supply.
63 2018-02-06 23:53:35 @trevortombe As a % of total production capacity how much oil and gas does Alberta export to BC?
64 2018-02-06 23:53:34 Tea Tree essential oil is toxic to dogs!!! Do not diffuse it around your animals!!!
65 2018-02-06 23:53:25 Y’all be swearing ya dermatologist or skin care gurus telling girls to put coconut oil on their face and just drink tea to make horomonal cystic agonaway

67 2018-02-06 23:53:14 Since everyone's been asking, my skin care routine is a tonic i invented made up of equal parts unfiltered organic Argan Oil, olive oil, salicylic acid, peppermint schnapps, Apple cider vinegar, and axe 3 in 1 shampoo-conditioner-face-and-bodywash
68 2018-02-06 23:53:09 I feel like I need to oil my knees lol
69 2018-02-06 23:53:05 Two hours for an oil change is beyond ridiculous 
70 2018-02-06 23:52:56 I'd recommend grinding map 3-4 for Akagi/Kaga which will help a ton

Also if you have cubes, drop on aircraft gacha after Neps for Enterprise because she's basically a hard solo carry for everything lol

Also try levelling your ships with the 1200 oil expedition for mass gains
71 2018-02-06 23:52:55 Get you some fish oil and vitamin d they boost ya energy (not multivitamin kind)

81 2018-02-06 23:50:49 Absolutely pointless if it yellows why not just use oil? Never used it and don't plan too

83 2018-02-06 23:50:33 For black history month, can anyone tell me who was the FIRST African American to successfully drill a oil well in the United States of America?
84 2018-02-06 23:50:01 Dear @RachelNotley  Please leave BC alone and find an alternative solution. Talk to Donald Trump and take the dilbit and oil through Washington state or somewwhere else. We have lovely wine, you're missing out. #abpoli #bcpoli

88 2018-02-06 23:49:21 Plants, which transform CO2 into oxygen, have been diminishing due to deforestation and climate change. But the biggest problem with CO2 is from burning fossil fuels. Global big oil/mining interests are behind much of what’s going on worldwide.
89 2018-02-06 23:49:10 BC now gets it's oil from Alberta via Kinder Morgan or (about 40%) from US. Would you rather get your oil from US (some by tanker from Alaska) than from and expanded Kinder Morgan
90 2018-02-06 23:49:08 No worries for us. Plenty of oil in Washington. China could ship to us too. The only question is Would Alberta implode?
91 2018-02-06 23:49:05 Okayyyy idk if its just me buttttt tell me WHY DO GIRLS PUT OIL ON THEIR FACE BEFORE APPLYING MAKEUP LIKE ITS A PRIMER IT AINT NO MF PRIMER BITCH WAT it just makes YoU LoOK OILY AS FUCK

94 2018-02-06 23:48:48 time to turn off all the Albertan oil pipelines if they want to play that game. #bcpoli #abpoli #Pipelines #environment #cdnpoli
95 2018-02-06 23:48:17 I could “2 pattties” but them fries be DRENCHED in Peanut Oil #NoSir
96 2018-02-06 23:48:11 Well if it’s low enough for them to recommend fish oil trust me when I say pay the extra for the no taste etc etc ones.... or you will beg for kale! 
97 2018-02-06 23:47:34 i hope you are taking it to maintenance and checking the oil and fluids lol
98 2018-02-06 23:47:34 Dinner tonight included spiralized sweet potatoes cooked in garlic and olive oil 
99 2018-02-06 23:47:27 yeah until the oil criminals basically halted the flow of oil in the mid 70's then slowly hiked the price every week holding the world to ransom just like today. Effn criminals indeed!
100 2018-02-06 23:47:23 Wait, people were short volatility? I've got something for the stress of losing all that money. It's proven to increase your luck in the future too. The snakes even enjoy the way we extract the oil, so it's animal friendly.
101 2018-02-06 23:47:14 Only way this is palatable is if the goal is energy independence, no more Mideast oil. Hence no more meddling in Mideast politics, no more wars for oil.
102 2018-02-06 23:47:08 immediately. We will not drill for oil, we will not dig for coal, we will go back in time and praise Nikola Tesla. Yes, jobs will be lost but money is based off of merit and trade. We will still have law enforcement on a global scale because the system works GLOBALLY. Again, +
103 2018-02-06 23:46:42 Day two of my fancy diet, and I about to eat a carob/honey/puffed brown rice/coconut oil/cashew butter dessert thing. We shall see.
104 2018-02-06 23:46:40 Sooo we'll keep our wine and they can keep their oil? Seems fair.
105 2018-02-06 23:46:17 I wouldn’t call wiping out the entire pacific coast line becuase oil companies don’t want to pay for inevitable cleanups petty. #getinformed
106 2018-02-06 23:46:05 I agree. Though with the grease in Reign's hair and the oil on Lesnar, it's gonna be hard to get a pin.
107 2018-02-06 23:45:54 Yet Alberta wants to force a pipeline through BC to ship oil to countries with poor human rights records. Somehow figuring it is wrong to get oil from countries with poor rights records but it is OK to sell oil to countries with poor rights records. Makes little sense.
108 2018-02-06 23:45:54 If you made any sense or had a cogent point I wouldn't mind but your strongest suits are good hair and "una Cara dura".  Known to be the strengths of a liar and snake oil salesman.
109 2018-02-06 23:45:54 Thank God  for the  new oil and  gas pipelines could  you  pitcher oil still being  hauls by rail with  all these  train wrecks

111 2018-02-06 23:45:45 In last 4 years Every Govt action saved money; oil pool money saved due to low global oil prices ; Interest on saving slashed above all Inflation was between 3 to 4%.  Still our economy is struggling to hive 8% GDP year on year

113 2018-02-06 23:45:33 No.   That's why they're "progressive"
114 2018-02-06 23:45:27 The extra money Alberta makes from oil is shared with other provinces including bc. So don’t act like you haven’t and won’t benefit. You have. And for zero investment or liability. And that does not mean I necessarily support the pipeline. Just that bc DOES benefit.
115 2018-02-06 23:45:26 Turn your goo into oil first.
116 2018-02-06 23:45:25 Sent from your organic, oil free phone I assume?
117 2018-02-06 23:45:17 or- you can explain to us how transfer payments work that shows alberta oil doesn’t benefit b.c. at all. we’ll wait.
118 2018-02-06 23:45:04 For lunch I had brown/wild rice with tuna, tomatoes, and avocado. For a sauce I mixed mustard, olive oil, garlic powder, and pepper. Was yummmmm. 10/10 would eat again.
119 2018-02-06 23:44:56 Don Getty forgot to sign “Transfer Certificates “ for oil going east. It didn’t take long for Ontario & Ottawa to take notice
120 2018-02-06 23:44:48 Just because Russia and USA are playing games with Syrian lives over oil, doesn’t mean Assad isn’t a tyrant.

Of armed groups, there’re no good guys. Peaceful demonstrators were hijacked by the Assad regime and foreign powers.

But I absolutely agree: the West should stay out
121 2018-02-06 23:44:40 I bought one last Sunday, it doesn’t have the certified vegan logo and one of the ingredients is palm oil. I don’t recommend them.
122 2018-02-06 23:44:29 To support my Alberta friends in their efforts to ship their oil, I will hurt Vancouver's economy by continuing to live here and drive up housing prices.
123 2018-02-06 23:44:29 Love my iPhone 8
124 2018-02-06 23:44:20 I know it’s a lot but I have to do it so it may be something you want to try if you really wanna do some oil work
125 2018-02-06 23:44:11 PTFE lube of course ;) (more seriously mix olive oil and some drops of lavender aromatherapy oil: fully natural and super cheap)
126 2018-02-06 23:43:56 If you need a new facial mouisturizer, try jojoba oil.... 

But don't forgot about me when your  complexion clears up
127 2018-02-06 23:43:53 CBD oil has helped me a lot, certainly not a cure but great for pain especially.
128 2018-02-06 23:43:47 The green tea in it really does not give much exfoliation, but as a cleanser, it's GREAT & works really well. You also need to use such a TINY bit to get squeaky clean. I use the dhc deep cleansing oil first & then the neogen. It's so calming leaves skin so soft too.
129 2018-02-06 23:43:45 Okay so I’m an Interior Designer and I use to use oil a lot a few tricks I learned are; a Tylenol before I start, chew gum the whole time, drink a lot of water, and vicks under my nose..
130 2018-02-06 23:43:33 Inevitable? Surely you're familiar with the Carbon Competitiveness Incentives program and the drive by oil sands producers to lower carbon-intensity by 30-40%? Spill remediation regulations? TM spill history? Pipeline integrity management programs? New pipeline tech?
131 2018-02-06 23:43:32 I already have lavender, peppermint and tea tree oil so just gotta buy the milk! Thank you so much for this!!!!
132 2018-02-06 23:43:30 there are plenty of good jobs already in MA. if you can work in oil rig you can work in construction. stop complaining.
133 2018-02-06 23:43:30 I came here with some braid oil and spray.... 

I’m going back to Orlando with a whole beauty supply store in my bag
134 2018-02-06 23:43:28 the answer to everything is peppermint oil
135 2018-02-06 23:43:28 Therefore the sustainable model shld be backed. Spending doesn’t guarantee titles. it looks a lucrative option coz teams like utd, city and Chelsea have created that illusion with yoy spending. Btw only Utd have crazy sponsorship deals and they havent won in 5 yrs. rest is oil ££
136 2018-02-06 23:43:11 peppermint essential oil is the way to my heart n if i don’t get some for valentines day imma b pissed

141 2018-02-06 23:42:45 this unit is sailable we might repair engines before leaving either I have a beff to settle with a pres over there cheap part made to look lime good quality 1 over 1/2 mil oil clean up when that hose blew
142 2018-02-06 23:42:45 I have a real life obsession with coconut oil 
143 2018-02-06 23:42:38 History means nothing to these ass hole! They dream and tell for truth! Reagan was the sorriest President in my life time! Bush I guess I mess up on that statement, Bush got a lot of men killed and wounded. Nothing but OIL! No telling what Trump will do ! Trump is Greedy! Arrogan
144 2018-02-06 23:42:35 But, but, they really LOVE pulling oil out of the ground and selling it overseas!
145 2018-02-06 23:42:25 You’re right, not all pipeline supporters are right-wing. I’m speaking more to Notley’s aggressive tone and actions against the BC NDP. She’s acting like this so she doesn’t look weak on oil to her political opponents
146 2018-02-06 23:42:18 We do not need Alberta to purchase anything we produce.  There are many more bidders in the game.  They can move their oil to Nova Scotia.
147 2018-02-06 23:42:15 “Oil to an engine is like blood in your body”... thanks for the advice Dad
148 2018-02-06 23:42:14 私も瀬名泉に俺が好き？って聞かれたい

150 2018-02-06 23:41:58 Facial oil or saline solution for eyes/contact lenses always works xx
151 2018-02-06 23:41:56 Grapes to oil not quite apples to apples! I’ve never heard anyone afraid of a wine spill. Is this how we do politics now? @RachelNotley
152 2018-02-06 23:41:43 seems fair. alberta keeps their dirty tarsnds  oil, and we keep our world rated wines... cheers !
153 2018-02-06 23:41:42 The idiocy of it all is snowballing with no sign of stopping. 
I'll bet muppet-lad is laughing all the way to India drinking BC whine and using Saudi oil in the government jetplane.
Should be a Cessna or steerage class on a sloow vessel.
154 2018-02-06 23:40:54 Argan oil and witch hazel
155 2018-02-06 23:40:54 This dude on this oil rig was saying El Salvador is one of those “shithole countries” smh I hate white people sometimes
156 2018-02-06 23:40:54 Ya it was definitely meant to be persuasive and show the "positives" over the obvious harsher negatives present in the oil sands industry
157 2018-02-06 23:40:44 Alternative energies will be developed, likely not wind & solar, theyre proving to be both economic and environmental disasters, in mean time we have oil, many people seem to prefer it come from countries with zero environmental & human rights standards because they hate Alberta
158 2018-02-06 23:40:31 No palm oil in packets of UK Doritos!
159 2018-02-06 23:40:30 Lesson learned!!! Coconut oil cannot fix everything;!!!!!!:-;!!;;;!!;;;;;;;
160 2018-02-06 23:40:27 Basically Rachel Notley NDP picks on the one BC industry that is non unionized in order to defend big corporate oil. Meanwhile BC NDP be like "who cares"  #bcpoli
161 2018-02-06 23:40:27 Vitamin e oil worked for me
162 2018-02-06 23:40:25 Bar wings are also typically nasty. 
A bunch of deep-fried wings -- removes the chicken fat and substitutes vegetable oil -- then tossed with Franks Hot Sauce. 
Vulgar.

165 2018-02-06 23:40:06 Wine v Oil.
$70million versus $2.5 billion.
Seems lopsided to me. 
But I’ve always been poor at math.
166 2018-02-06 23:39:56 Yeah but lets be honest, Goku is with Chichi because he is forced to. They have as much romantic connection as oil and water.
167 2018-02-06 23:39:55 Alright y'all we're cooking and Noli gets olive oil all over her hands. It was clean I guess, but instead of washing her hands off, she proceeded to running her hands thru her hair. Ok this is some next level cooking life hack or straight triflin... you decide.
168 2018-02-06 23:39:55 Just a fancy way to say oil
169 2018-02-06 23:39:53 Ass you are! Want to see my paycheck pal and I'm a teacher! Go up! Your're a cheap snake oil salesman and not a very good one at that!!!
170 2018-02-06 23:39:50 No oil changes on a Tesla. You do need to refill the windshield washer fluid if you decide to skip maintenance checkups. The manual is on-screen in the car, so it would be "start to finish" not "cover to cover." ;)
171 2018-02-06 23:39:38 Ms. Notley,  British Columbians will not be pressured into moving Alberta oil in our province until we are certain of its safety.  For it will not be your coastline disasterously impacted if there is a spill it will be ours.  Feel free never to purchase our wines.
172 2018-02-06 23:39:33 Don't listen to these guys, Premier. You have the Constitution on your side and @JustinTrudeau and the NEB to ram it down their throat. Spend your time helping oil sands producers lower the carbon-intensity of their crude by 30-40% (to same level as average USA sweet light crude)
173 2018-02-06 23:39:18 Alberta's need for KM is directly linked to ++ govt revenues.

Especially if oil prices rise. 

Without KM, their taxes would have to go up.

But AB has the lowest tax jurisdiction already.

So, BC has to accept KM to keep taxes down in AB...

174 2018-02-06 23:39:04 I agree Dianne we must protect our coastlines from Trump's greedy plan to take more of the planets resources without thoughts of how it'll effect parts of the planet! With the severe storms & earthquakes on the rise,the oil rigs could be damaged & leak oil all over our coasts!
175 2018-02-06 23:39:01 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
176 2018-02-06 23:38:52 I also don't use 100% essential oil, I use 5-10% (heavily watered down) which are cheaper and not dangerous to kitties since flea medication uses essential oils! I had to give my 100%s away but its worth it for my bebis

178 2018-02-06 23:38:45 anyone know how to get rid of oil bumps on ur face??? any tips would be greatly appreciated
179 2018-02-06 23:38:40 we still love british ppl. you're one of them who care about reality but unfortunately british gov betrayed with us as a kurds in north of iraq. they sold us only for some oil rigs in kirkuk with iraqi army and iranian military occupied our city kirkuk 
180 2018-02-06 23:38:38 Yes be proud to attack the EPA that attacks our environment our very need for existence..idiot..oh yes open mines to release more crap into the air...oh yes drill for more oil because oil is healthy right...fat cat care only about your bottom line.
181 2018-02-06 23:38:34 In 20 years the only thing new in AI is the discovery of oil (tflops). It’s enough to make it interesting, but there is no approaching singularity a) quantum effects limit energy density 2) there are no reinforcing factors so it’s not going to escalate until there is new science.
182 2018-02-06 23:38:23 Have each on different days. Roast sweet potato cubes with coconut oil and nutmeg, butternut squash another day, roasted red potatoes and asparagus

186 2018-02-06 23:37:43 Watching from soddy daisy tennessee. Cant wait for the lucas oil race at boyds speedway
187 2018-02-06 23:37:41 my dumbass just asked (myself) “do you pit on lotin before or after tanning oil...?”
188 2018-02-06 23:37:37 Can you read? My comment clearly states that high gas prices is bad for consumers but good for oil industry. 
189 2018-02-06 23:37:37 Oil well let's see

We have our own oil reserves that are under developed. Now we have a good excuse to develop them
Natural gas is being sold to Asia and the US anyway 
We could buy oil if need be from the US and Russia while we get our own production up to speed
190 2018-02-06 23:37:16 Sería bueno pueda aplicarse también a empresas en general donde el gas oil es un insumo necesario y con gran peso en los costos. Ejemplo empresas de camineria y rutas. Debería actualizarse lista de agro, transporte prof y excavaciones.
191 2018-02-06 23:37:16 This assumes that oil is the only form of energy in existence... alternative energies need to be developed.  Maybe that's a good place for AB to invest, instead of worrying about oil sands.
192 2018-02-06 23:37:15 excuse me, did you read how that spill happened? and my question remains- would you rather we have no oil being transported? or is rail a better way?
193 2018-02-06 23:37:12 But I would have taken good care of that Tesla. 

I would have washed it every day and always changed the oil on schedule. 

Maybe they don't use oil? Well, I'd have read the owner's manual cover to cover and I'm sure it would have said all stuff related to oil changes or not.
194 2018-02-06 23:37:10 My man loves smelling my face and when I put tea tree oil on it he hates it he doesn’t like the smell lol
195 2018-02-06 23:37:07 Relationships are like cars. Cant be mad if it keeps breaking down when you never change the oil. Then you go buy a new car. Its good in the beginning, then that mfer break down. Find out why the shit breaking down. If its worth fixing, fix it. If not, do better with the next car
196 2018-02-06 23:37:06 ISIS has launched suicide attacks against Turkey.

it's Assad who released ISIS from prison. it's Assad who is the number one buyer of ISIS oil - yet Leftist never attack Assad for it because PKK channels their fans to attack Turkey - the one ally left helping FSA.

199 2018-02-06 23:36:52 Last hospitalization I used white noise machine, oil diffuser, fan, pulled the blackout curtain, own pillow, & RN’s put signs on door saying to not enter without passing through RN station (due to privacy/sleep needs & germs). Get sleep when can, but it’s hard in the vinyl beds
200 2018-02-06 23:36:45 Well you can only play the cards you're dealt.  Would be nice if #ableg could cut off BC's oil & gas supplies so Greens could experience their paradise now.

202 2018-02-06 23:36:34 Trump's love affair with oil and cars facilitates 100+ vehicular deaths each DAY and he wants a WALL. He should be out behind one.
203 2018-02-06 23:36:26 Castor oil def works!
204 2018-02-06 23:36:23 They have, and the biggest payoff is the treason - TRUMP share in Rosneft-Exxon Russia-ANWR -Arctic Circle oil deal from not enforcing the Sanctions is worth 12 BILLION. Mentioned in the Dossier, and true.( CarterPage gets a cut in same deal)SA investments he made are tidy, too.
205 2018-02-06 23:36:21 They all leak or spill eventually. The oil companies are suddenly gone when it happens.
206 2018-02-06 23:36:15 I had a oil stain on my uggs like two days ago and now its gone lol
207 2018-02-06 23:36:15 No Wade tonight on top of everything else. This is an oil spill spreading and no way to contain it. I am so bummed by recent events.

210 2018-02-06 23:35:30 My final shout out goes to Han at A-1 Japanese Auto Care on SR7. A shop with integrity. He gave my car a well needed oil change.
211 2018-02-06 23:35:03 It’s KNOWN that crude oil is just Very Vintage bacteria, anyway. Ipso facto.
212 2018-02-06 23:35:00 Using a meme to come back proves you have no argument. I suggest you look at the improvements first brought to Venezuela and increased quality of life when Chavez came into power before Saudis overproduced oil (strange as it damages their own economy) and before trade embargo
213 2018-02-06 23:34:58 Everybody should buy BC wine for the next couple of weeks! Vote with your wallet! Do you want bitumen shipments to go through BC coastal waters? If you do, don’t buy BC wine. But if it concerns you to see the incredible increase in oil tankers buy BC WINES!
214 2018-02-06 23:34:57 My sister got me Mary Jane lil thing we're i put it inside and say "Shoot this is cute and imma put baby oil in it." Forgot to throw it away
215 2018-02-06 23:34:56 I really can’t understand why there is not yet an anti Trust case against Google. They are bigger and more dominant in their market than Standard Oil ever dreamed of. Break Google up. Competition will be good for Americans.

220 2018-02-06 23:34:18 If Trump granted clean energy, how could the GOP get the big oil and gas payoffs
221 2018-02-06 23:34:14 Apparently sniffing peppermint oil will help but I'm not sure if this is something that can be purchased at a regular grocery store.
222 2018-02-06 23:34:07 وحشتني ... مفهاش ليه
223 2018-02-06 23:34:06 yeah, i've read on the internet that you can drink crude oil for the same reasons
224 2018-02-06 23:34:02 ありがとうございます！( ´∀｀ )
225 2018-02-06 23:33:55 Of course you don't understand. If you had to pay the true price for oil...paying cash for the damage done...you wouldn't ship it. Not by rail, not by pipeline. That's not the race. The race is oil vs. clean energy. Your pipeline will never pay for itself.
226 2018-02-06 23:33:55 1 egg, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, 3 tablespoons sugar (they said 4 but 3 is quite ok), 1 tablespoon flour, 2 tablespoons cocoa. 2min in the microwave at 700W for cupcake consistency. less time for brownie consistency...still working out times and mug/recipient combo

239 2018-02-06 23:31:57 May or may not be putting too much faith into this "quick study" essential oil blend...
240 2018-02-06 23:31:53 DIRECTIONAL BORING MACHINES  could be a answer to big oil rigs they can drill from land and go for thousands of feet
241 2018-02-06 23:31:42 My preference is 1. Shut off all oil, gas diesel supplies to BC, 2. Shut down all the pipelines that transport BC NG through Alberta, they don't want  pipelines see how they do with out them.
242 2018-02-06 23:31:39 ICE, thousands of police departments, private armies attacking US citizens for oil companies. People think need money more than ethics , guess sellouts like the "official thugs"  are the new normal.

244 2018-02-06 23:31:32 BC wants some money to ship oil through it's province to it's coast.
Alberta wants to keep all the money.

256 2018-02-06 23:30:14 What is likely to run out first, world oil reserves or chocolate; surly we can live without the oil but chocolate no.

268 2018-02-06 23:28:59 Rather than getting bogged down in details, I look at it in terms of ratios. In a tofu stirfry, the bulk of your ingredients are fresh veggies. Processed foods, like soy sauce, oil, corn starch, tofu, etc. probably make up only 1/4 of the dish. Therefore, it's mostly unprocessed.
269 2018-02-06 23:28:58 Seriously? Nice try Alberta but wine spills can be cleaned up a little easier than oil.

287 2018-02-06 23:25:50 Turn off the taps.  

Let the lower main land live without oil stop BC gas from running thru AB. The time has come for AB to play hardball.
288 2018-02-06 23:25:35 The @bcndp should just announce that they're gonna start building nuclear power plants in Alberta and the sit back and watch the reactions of my fellow Albertans who want to stick an oil pipeline through BC.
289 2018-02-06 23:25:33 I don't buy anything with palm oil in it, I don't use coconut oil. So, yeah, I've seen palm oil.
290 2018-02-06 23:25:32 Don’t do like every other roughneck out here: don’t blow all your paycheck on days off. Also, first night, last night are the most dangerous. Keep your head in the game until the final down. Be careful on your drive/flight home.
291 2018-02-06 23:25:14 Everything with Slusho, discovering the monster, using its blood for ingredients. Oil attacks, Taguoato.
292 2018-02-06 23:25:11 It softens your skin and I use lavender essential oil which helps relax your muscles I usually use coconut milk it has loads vitamin e which is super good for your skin

294 2018-02-06 23:25:06 At least the damage we do in independent Scotland be our own making and with our oil reserves coming to the new Scottish Republic we can fix our economic path , not pay for hs2 westmonster and trident and buck hse sorted ma luv .....
295 2018-02-06 23:25:03 I’m left wing, and i’m in support of this pipeline. it’s not only right wing people who want it, it’s people who are realistic about the importance of oil to this country, who get that renewables will remain an impossible way of 100% heating our homes this far north any time soon
296 2018-02-06 23:24:58 They cry about it but fill there car with fuel and have electricity, and have heat, and how basically every product they own depends on oil to be manufactured so who are we to talk?
297 2018-02-06 23:24:52 During the massage, while covered in aromatic oils, I remembered we ran out of olive oil.

Can a girl learn to relax?
298 2018-02-06 23:24:51 The oil one. O sounds like five in sino korean numbers and il sounds like the word for day
299 2018-02-06 23:24:50 Came to get my oil changed and an older gentleman waited until all the guys in the room walked outside and then told me to go to their website and get a $15 off coupon  okkkaaayyyyy 
300 2018-02-06 23:24:43 Today BamTeddy cooked and CeeC was there assisting in warming the sauce Princes thought she cooked that food & started shouting rice to plantain complaining. Issue of people eating meat & wasting of veggie oil. Confront CeeC and correct her she is a sister but for where.
301 2018-02-06 23:24:42 Should we ban Alberta beef if an oil spill happens?
302 2018-02-06 23:24:34 I was planning on making a beard oil gift set. I had the perfect gift box and everything lol

305 2018-02-06 23:23:53 the Trump administration is manipulating evidence on Iran in the same way the Bush administration did to cultivate public support for ousting Saddam Hussein.millions more will die as its all about Gas,Oil ,Arms sells and a greater Israel,u r an illusionist
306 2018-02-06 23:23:51 So BC wants insurance that an oil pipeline spill could be cleaned up properly and not destroy our coast, and now Alberta can’t have wine anymore? Sounds reasonable.
307 2018-02-06 23:23:41 There are massive initiatives in mining to attract women.  In the oil sands, a few trends emerged suggesting that women made better haul truck drivers, generally.

310 2018-02-06 23:23:15 Although this doesn't really affect people in NEBC,  it's a shame. There are people down south that do support the oil and gas industry that will be hit by this.
311 2018-02-06 23:23:14 Dear Premier Notley, AB craft beer is not the same as B.C. wine. Also liquor and oil don't mix. Tit for tat is for elementary kids!! #bcwine #aboil #betterstockuptoday

314 2018-02-06 23:22:28 Weird when people don’t know anything about the oil industry or how it works... I’m sure the coast will be fine, me in particular would know

318 2018-02-06 23:22:08 OIL BRENT US$66.91/bbl -0.74%. CNOOC announces plans to spend US$12.8bn to drill 132 wells and acquire 19,000sq km of seismic in 2018.

331 2018-02-06 23:20:20 Ummm, the NDP is attempting to do just that, ban Alberta oil from BC.  So.... I think you have the gander and goose mixed up. 
Just wait... next it could be the "taps" are shut off to the lower mainland. Don't think you'll be so smug then.
332 2018-02-06 23:20:13 Cannabis is the only thing that helps me. Especialy the CBD infused gummies. The oil not so much. I wish marijuana was legal.
333 2018-02-06 23:19:54 This grown man just really had me out here in the rain to check his oil and fluids... if you can't check oil or read the minimum and maximum marks on everything else, you shouldn't be allowed to have a license.

340 2018-02-06 23:18:39 There’s an essential oil for everything! 
341 2018-02-06 23:18:35 My first post AudiCare scheduled maintenance and oil change was today. I was sweating bullets but it was only $165! That’s NOT bad relatively speaking. Lol
342 2018-02-06 23:18:25 If you believe CBD oils should be categorized as a schedule 1 drug you are completely uneducated about the oil and what a schedule 1 drug is.
343 2018-02-06 23:18:09 Really THICK oil...
344 2018-02-06 23:17:56 It's not just soda too, all caffeine, coffee, energy drinks, even alcohol all dehydrate the skin. And also be careful with exfoliants as well, over using will dry out your skin which will cause it to produce even more oil to make up the difference.
345 2018-02-06 23:17:45 No oil trucking anti-environmental space cadets on my page peace. Oh and careful driving flammable around all day,
346 2018-02-06 23:17:38 In case you do not understand, @DitheringWenger BOE means nat gas, NGL and oil.  Not just oil. They each earn vastly different returns. Thus, that bogus netback (yes, it is bogus, as it does not include all operating costs) is not compared to WTI, but the combined BOE price paid.
347 2018-02-06 23:17:14 Why does it feel like a doctors appointment when I take my car for an oil change?
348 2018-02-06 23:17:02 Because marijuana itself isn’t legal just cbd oil

353 2018-02-06 23:16:48 I think so. But really a digital dollar issued by the fed, only to be used in the US and for buying oil around the world Hmm . Can I use the digital dollar to buy chocolate in Europe? Or will I be using a crypto currency when the time is right?
354 2018-02-06 23:16:47 Damn I had to pay for tires and an oil change this week. I’m about to die because this too much adulting for me at once.
355 2018-02-06 23:16:18 I’ve been in the car dealership for 2 hours now! I only needed an oil change...this is so stupid :-/

369 2018-02-06 23:15:03 I think @ValaAfshar is referring to the useful side of oil not the oil itself. But you’re right data is growing exponentially but refined data is not. Adoption of #AI and similar technologies is not moving fast but will soon do

394 2018-02-06 23:11:59 I believe the statement was ~$1.5b, and less about the economy and more about govt royalty revenues. Presumes TMX shrinks the AB oil price discount by ~$5/bbl or so -- which is not unreasonable.

398 2018-02-06 23:11:47 There's always a big uproar from Alberta whenever anything anti-oil goes down. I suspect that the objections will get quieter in relation to the increase in autonomous oil and gas operations. People don't care about pipelines, they care about jobs.
399 2018-02-06 23:11:45 Oui, c'est vrai.

Venezuala hung all of their social programs on one industry and left the rest of the economy to capitalism, and with declining interest in gas and increased cost to extract oil, they're going to hell in a handbasket.

415 2018-02-06 23:09:20 When I lived in Kelowna, the arrogant Albertan's took over the city with their big rigs, trucks, trailers. No respect for the locals.  Now that the oil market has them in the skids, there are fewer of them. Sadly they relied on one market to sustain their province.
416 2018-02-06 23:09:12 I think it depends on microwave power, too...this was 1 egg, 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, 3 tablespoons of sugar, 2 tablespoons of cocoa, 1 table spoon of plain flour. I put this one in the microwave for 2min (my microwave oven runs at 700W). this came out like a cupcake

Venezuala's only socialized industry is their oil and natural gas production, but that's an awfully small nail to try to hang a hat on.

424 2018-02-06 23:08:04 It appears that from what His Excellency is saying, the North would enjoy their resources fully while the South would relinquish their oil to the Federal government. Is this the planned restructuring arrangement?
425 2018-02-06 23:07:50 So ayun po no. Nakasakay na ako. Tapos sobrang sikip tapos pinulikat ako. Edi binunggo ko sila para maistretch ko paa ko. Tapos nalaglag bag ko pati oil control film. Tapos yung tingin nila sakin nakakaasar. Excuse me, nagpapakinis din ako kahit papaano noh 
426 2018-02-06 23:07:48 Well I suppose you could run your vehicles and heat your homes and businesses with weed and veggies and tourism...said noone ever. What is the oil consumption in BC?
427 2018-02-06 23:07:42 Oil can fetch up to 3.5 grams of Charlie.
428 2018-02-06 23:07:26 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.
429 2018-02-06 23:06:53 Alberta announcing they're going to stop buying BC wine because they're putting environmental protection measures in place for oil pipelines is like the guy on tinder who berates and harasses his matches when they don't laugh at his sexist pickup lines.
430 2018-02-06 23:06:51 Kenney is a career politician who’s only interest is getting elected. His career is the polar opposite of those working in oil and gas. If you believe he has you and your coworkers best interests in front of his own then good luck to you sir. #ableg

433 2018-02-06 23:05:59 Nah bruh in the future a bunch of countries get racist again as globalism strips away cushy factory jobs and also play empire on shoestring budgets/debt and Poland passes a law criminalizing saying the holocaust was even partly their fault
434 2018-02-06 23:05:51 Well tell your mates (the ones you sold out to) to stop fucking with weather programs, fuck the oil off and develop the tesla coil and stop with all the Wars. Also they should stop volcanoes erupting and they should seize the biggest contributor to co2.. livestock flatulence
435 2018-02-06 23:05:49 man that oil had me feeling good  slept like a baby
436 2018-02-06 23:05:46 That deliciously sweet scent is hard to resist!  And you hair must be loving all that nourishing almond oil and cocoa butter!
437 2018-02-06 23:05:41 Mad asl the hoes just not telling me to stop using coconut oil.
438 2018-02-06 23:05:40 Niggle, yes. Street smarts, yes. But Lamela/Alli type stuff is in the same book as having an oligarch/oil state owner for me. Winning but losing your soul.
439 2018-02-06 23:05:27 I am indeed!
Never tweeted at him either. 
He is scared of me and is right to be. We didn't get on when we met last year. I saw him for the snake oil salesman he truly is.
440 2018-02-06 23:05:18 It’ll be interesting to see what certain people like more. Wine or Oil. I also can’t wait to see who still calls Notley anti-pipeline after this.
441 2018-02-06 23:05:17 Torie is that poorly she just sneezed and now all I can smell is Olbas oil
442 2018-02-06 23:05:10 It gets me a place to visit when I turn 65 in 40 years, we’ve yet to explore 1/10 of 1% if Mars surface- imagine underground? If it’s true Mars had widespread life at one point millions of years ago, we’re talking untapped oil- who knows.

446 2018-02-06 23:04:33 I always struggle to get off too sleep. There's always so much stuff whirling around in my head!!  #sleepmatters. I would love to try out some of that oil, I'll rub it into my temples and see if it works... finger crossed.

452 2018-02-06 23:03:17 The part about planting at the same rate is the key... And alongside the wildfires lately - it's been tough with that. 
How often do the oil spills occur? Is it something that's a consistent concern, or an occasional one?
453 2018-02-06 23:03:13 Agh I hate that cars have to  do an oil change 
454 2018-02-06 23:03:13 By covering public lands with oil, gas, and coal operations and blocking them with welfare ranchers fences and cows, there will be a lot less visiting of public lands due to YOU, you phony.
455 2018-02-06 23:03:13 If anyone has an oil change co. suggestion that isn’t over an hour and 15 min wait (even when you called ahead) or denies you over an hour before closing let me know. Done with @LambsTire. Tried 3 different locations today and 5 over the last week. Thx! #Austin

476 2018-02-06 23:01:49 Lemme get my oil change before i start going up n down this whole week
477 2018-02-06 23:01:46 thank you. RENEWABLE ENERGY is here now. why why why are we still going full tilt on oil and gas????

482 2018-02-06 23:01:05 (3/3) ...with all good intentions to try to save the whole world, yet the views might be somewhat clouded by lobbyists’ efforts well funded by certain oil rich economies with certain religious bias. Let us also try to see the situation from Suu Kyi’s point of view. Thanks.
483 2018-02-06 23:00:58 Ok. This is probably ridiculous but I want to rant and #NothingMatters #BreakfastWine -the world’s ending probably, but I HATE CANOLA OIL. “Canola” aka Rape Seed oil. An industrial lubricant. Heated to 500 degrees and deodorized so you don’t fucking smell it. It’s in everything

485 2018-02-06 23:00:41 What about protecting our planet? Isn't that your job? What is your position on solar energy and the crippling tariffs that will give the commercial advantage to coal that is anything but clean. You work for us. Not for coal and oil company executives.
486 2018-02-06 23:00:35 OIL DIFF: 3.51 -> 3.55
487 2018-02-06 23:00:25 I agree, however your position is too limited; it also doesn't explain why businesses are closing left right and centre here in #VanRE

Do I buy gas at $1.50/litre because big oil delivers good service? No!

Also, government is subject to the same pressures: by-way of elections.
488 2018-02-06 23:00:23 Yet he chose to work in the oil industry. Paid better, I guess.
489 2018-02-06 23:00:07 Would you guys like to see a sort of "Bowling 101" kind of series?  Where I explain the basics like how to keep score, how to throw a hook, how to read an oil pattern chart, spare shooting, etc.?
490 2018-02-06 23:00:05 Up to $2.5 billion boost to our coffers by reducing the price differential. Our oil currently sells at ~$30 less than it should because we can't access overseas markets. TMX will fix. #ableg
491 2018-02-06 23:00:05 No makeup remover? No worries! Grab extra virgin olive oil out of your kitchen! Olive oil is natural, moisturizing &amp; will remove makeup.
492 2018-02-06 22:59:53 Got my eye exam for $10, and ordered these online for about $80 instead of the $150 I would have paid in store.

With that 80, I got all the bells and whistles:  clip ons, inscriptions, anti glare, oil, grease, blue light reduction, and an additional fee for weird perscription.
493 2018-02-06 22:59:53 Tillerson, oil tycoon, is visiting Jamaica to use us as a pawn in his war against Venezuela to get his hands on the oil. 
Everything else is quaternary.
494 2018-02-06 22:59:39 Maybe it's just me, but for me, wine will always be more delicious to drink than oil!
495 2018-02-06 22:59:38 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.

500 2018-02-06 22:59:05 I paid $1.48 per litre when I filled up yesterday. Why is this oil not being refined here? Why do we have to get it to market when clearly demand is not being met in Canada?
501 2018-02-06 22:58:44 So we can launch some rich dude’s car out over the ocean using rocket fuel, but everyone’s panties bunch up when the topic switches to drilling for oil.
502 2018-02-06 22:58:26 Why do they send so many oil & lube, Tide Pod, and Attends coupons? Are they trying to tell me something?
503 2018-02-06 22:58:24 Threaten to move the oil to Seattle
504 2018-02-06 22:58:23 Oklahoma doesn’t value education, that’s obvious. If they keep their constituents uneducated they can keep the state red. It’s been working for them so far. We’re #1 in earthquakes, Big oil owns this state and government caters to Big Oil. It’s embarrassing.
505 2018-02-06 22:58:09 Banning BC wine imports is a good elbow thrown by @RachelNotley. It's also kind of a burn: "You ban our society-propelling oil? We'll ban, uh, I guess wine is what you have, so WINE!"
506 2018-02-06 22:57:52 I love the way cocoNUT oil feels on me.

The list of power players is mind boggling. I'm imagine Hollywood like Investigators a'la All The Presidents Men, just to feel better
512 2018-02-06 22:56:06 Yes, sadly politics play into life.  I know we need to transition to greener energy.  However at this time, the world, and our economy still requires oil.  Shutting Alberta out of the world market just sends more revenue to other producing countries and reduces revenues in Canada

517 2018-02-06 22:55:54 Finally get all the new turbo gaskets on and everything back together for a high pressure oil line to bust this is why working in cars sucks infinitely more dicks than painting ever did
518 2018-02-06 22:55:52 When Kenney cuts corporate taxes and regulatory burdens I’m sure those oil companies will pass those cost savings directly on to you and your coworkers. #ableg #groundhogday
519 2018-02-06 22:55:45 It's not running out.. it's just too expensive to extract when oil prices are low. Is why production rises and falls sharply with the price of a barrel
520 2018-02-06 22:55:33 Lots of oil wells?
521 2018-02-06 22:55:33 I had changes down there happen so quickly. Also you’ll smell like a teen boy and have to shower all the time and ur face will oil up real good. I’m a month on T tomorrow and my face shape has already changed.

523 2018-02-06 22:55:24 Yes, I’ve pledged not to accept anything from big oil!
524 2018-02-06 22:55:24 Wood is a renewable resource; trees can be replanted, grown to maturity in place of those that are cut down. As long as the trees are replanted at the same rate they are cut. Tourism is one of BC's biggest industries, so one oil spill is all it takes for the economy/environment

535 2018-02-06 22:54:10 Lots of factors into stock price. Favorable oil prices, hurricanes (notice the stocks tick up right after Harvey), etc.  But how is this an argument? Oh their stock prices are up, so its ok for the government to keep screwing them with handouts to biofuel producers?
536 2018-02-06 22:54:01 I'd find self inflating tyres and self filling of that screen wash far more useful,oh and oil and petrol :-)

543 2018-02-06 22:52:34 Boy the more Notley opens her mouth the deeper hole she digs. Alberta can do whatever they like with their Oil Industry but they can’t risk our precious BC Coastline with their stupidity. She needs to come up with something better than this. BC won’t be bullied or manipulated...

558 2018-02-06 22:51:12 Should i do another oil painting or just waste the night away playing League? #Dilemma
559 2018-02-06 22:51:05 @TuesdayliveNTA Top Northern APC leaders will not accept total restructuring of Nigeria because of one item presented by the oil rich Niger Delta = 100% resource control. If the crude oil were to be situated up north, it will be easier.
560 2018-02-06 22:50:53 Now playing @findlaynapier Cold liver oil & the orange juice
561 2018-02-06 22:50:36 Going to Big-O-Tires today. Who wants to bet they'll discover something that needs to be done in addition to the oil change? 
562 2018-02-06 22:50:36 I get your point but it’s more of a broad ideological relation which is represented much different in each province. I hope they would work together too but in BC we have much different resources than Alberta and a finite resource like oil is bad to base a trade relationship on
563 2018-02-06 22:50:17 Around this time last year API inventory on the 7th of Feb 2017 had a build of 14.23m vs a draw today of 1.05m ... big swing #WTI #OIL #Brent
564 2018-02-06 22:49:58 I live on Vancouver Island and have an oil and gas related business in Alberta. I have thought and voiced my opinion that fuel costs should triple in the lower mainland and Vancouver Island. No O&G imports either. These numbskull neighbours need training!
565 2018-02-06 22:49:46 "For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:" ~Proverbs 5:3 #Bible
566 2018-02-06 22:49:37 How about a campaign against tourism in BC? Why would BC want that dirty Alberta money that comes (directly/indirectly) from oil and gas anyways, they’re not hypocrites are they? Spend your vacation in Ab, SK or the USA where your money is appreciated. This year I am.

568 2018-02-06 22:49:22 Oil prices are low.

She has also served on the advisory boards of oil company Petrobras and Vale SA

572 2018-02-06 22:49:07 I  Coconut Oil  I use it in so many different things & on my lil' rescued Dorgi . Never  it packaged like this, so convenient!
573 2018-02-06 22:49:03 CAPP really needs to develop a strategy that focuses on all the preventative elements that are part of moving oil to market. A huge, convincing and truthful strategy on how oil spills are preventable...
574 2018-02-06 22:49:00 半botだから、話しかけてね＼(^o^)／基本リプは返します＼(^o^)／オイルトークしようね＼(^o^)／
575 2018-02-06 22:48:39 Any economist claiming that the sky is falling with the 4% inflation in January is ignoring (1) inflation data for the past 17 year and (2) the fact that global oil prices crashed in 2015 - resulting in markedly lower inflation for 2015-2016.
576 2018-02-06 22:48:38 There is no large group in south africa calling it a genocide, many try and shew people like Lauren Southern  out so they dont disturb their place in Africa the most oil rich continent. Watch her video she hints at how uncomfortable many afrikhanaers made her.
577 2018-02-06 22:48:32 California uses more oil than any state
578 2018-02-06 22:48:31 Higher crude oil prices help Putin as oil & gas is Russia's most (only) major export & revenue source

Only a starry-eyed #MAGA-tard didn't realize a vote for Putin's Orange Eunuch was a vote to pay more at the pump

And it's almost certainly going to keep going up until 2021
579 2018-02-06 22:48:22 Lmao took my car to the dealership for an oil change & my car just died.
580 2018-02-06 22:48:09 If there is no oil offshore then there will be no drilling.
581 2018-02-06 22:47:54 It has gone on long enough and the necessary measures have taken place.  The moment people stop heating their homes, using oil based products, or using vehicles then these people can sit on their giant thrones of hypocrisy.
582 2018-02-06 22:47:48 Je suis pas bordelais mais je savais ce que c'était la Gascogne avant de connaître le principe de pays d'oil et d'oc etc

583 2018-02-06 22:47:40 While I appreciate the vegetable oil powered elevators (yay, environment!), I do wish they didn't stink of rancid oil.
584 2018-02-06 22:47:39 What??? John Kelly sautees Trump in olive oil and garlic???
585 2018-02-06 22:47:30 @RachelNotley go away no one in BC wants you dirty oil
586 2018-02-06 22:47:12 Rosehip oil has changed my life
587 2018-02-06 22:47:06 never seen so many self righteous tweets. There’s been oil refined on the shore of Burrard Inlet since 1915.The current terminal has been in operation since 1953.Oil flows via tanker everyday, everyday, thru Burrad Inlet, out English Bay, into the Salish sea
588 2018-02-06 22:46:54 My church uses Chick-fil-A sauce as anointing oil.
589 2018-02-06 22:46:47 Put iodized salt, water, and mint or some type of mint oil in a spray bottle. When you get the urge for whatever spray your chest and your sacred area (obviously not like directly between or in your legs) but in that area. It dispels energy. Use as often as you like/need.
590 2018-02-06 22:46:47 Wow  my mother  always  told  me  that   drinking  coconut. Water  it's  very  good  for  your  heath.  
  @boxedwholesale organic  coconut  oil, I would  love  to  receive  #dailygoodiebox  with this  amazing
591 2018-02-06 22:46:40 I put the plug in the tub when I showered this AM.
I put eucalyptus and lavender oil in the collecting water, and took huge gulps of air.
It helped a lot.
592 2018-02-06 22:46:31 While there may be “lots” of electric cars, you clearly haven’t seen what those cars do to the planet to mine. We are at least 50+ years away from going “off” oil. Do some research on what types of products you buy in stores and what they are made of, what you live in etc.. “lol”
593 2018-02-06 22:46:20 Forget about gas and oil.itsallelectricbattery
594 2018-02-06 22:46:14 Oil deyy ur head
595 2018-02-06 22:46:07 @Biancajewelz1 I would like to do bed wrestling with you, body oil.
596 2018-02-06 22:46:00 Are we going to have to also allow oil tankers to pass through fisheries in order to get that funding though @JustinTrudeau ?
597 2018-02-06 22:45:59 Burn an essential oil candle, run a hot bath, grab a glass of wine, and put on some ocean sounds. Go under the water and listen to the sounds of the ocean crashing. Listen to your breath. Listen to your heart. You’re here, you matter. Relax  you’re doing great. #notetoself
598 2018-02-06 22:45:56 One of these days i’m gonna forget to blow out the candle on my fragrance oil burner before going to bed and that’s how i’m going to die and kill everyone in my house as well
599 2018-02-06 22:45:51 So do you eat the fries? Rub the fries all over your head? Or just go straight to the source and dunk your head in the vat of oil?
600 2018-02-06 22:45:36 The weather is cold and yucky, sadly we can't change that, but what we can change is your oil! Call us to schedule an appointment. We've got you covered! #CallUs
601 2018-02-06 22:45:35 Body oil so the bommbb
602 2018-02-06 22:45:26 I love the Biosilk hair oil. I use the tiniest amount and warm it up on my hands, then run my fingers thru the bottom/ends of my hair and it helps allllloooot. It can make you greasy if you go near your roots with it so if you stay towards your ends, you’ll be fine
603 2018-02-06 22:45:15 Does this mean you are going to do more scenes? :D if so an oil scene would be amazing! ;)
604 2018-02-06 22:45:12 Precisely! Mom and I were looking at each other with VERY "fishy" expressions on our faces. Saw Oswald being paraded through Dallas jail. He said he was a "patsy". He was RIGHT! Saw Jack Ruby shoot him LIVE that Sunday morning! Bush, Johnson, CIA and BIG OIL plus THE MOB
605 2018-02-06 22:45:03 I saw one bedroom massage oil at the store yesterday.  The scent was so amazing. 
Was tempted to buy down and keep till I get married but e fit spoil 
606 2018-02-06 22:45:01 Yes @RachelNotley - just where was this rhetoric when Quebec pulled the rug out from underneath Alberta's oil industry?
607 2018-02-06 22:44:49 1 month Future Brent prices average around $68,95 year to date. Significantly higher than Q4 in 2017. Yet we saw big down days for #Enquest, #PremierOil, #CairnEnergy, #TullowOil etc, not really justified by YTD Brent average. #Oil #Brent #FTSE #SmallCaps.
608 2018-02-06 22:44:46 Honu Oil Cartridges are only $19 all day today!!!!
609 2018-02-06 22:44:44 Oil Man will always be Pharaoh Man *hits bong*

しまった、しまった
611 2018-02-06 22:44:34 I literally have this oil diffuser spraying lavender mist into my face and I’m STILL stressed. Send help.
612 2018-02-06 22:44:22 If that were true, Trump wouldn’t have anything to do. All he does is reverse all the wonderful things Obama did for our country. Enjoy those higher taxes in a couple years and try not to choke on the chemicals he deregulated. And don’t let the oil rigs ruin your views.
613 2018-02-06 22:44:21 i am just like yall i wished we did not have to but if you drive or fly or use power you are just as blame as all of us the real question is how to get the oil please explane what do we do? i want our waters clean to do we buy oil from people that want to kill us with nuke bombs
614 2018-02-06 22:43:57 It seems my new fascination with a girl named Alexa has combined badly with talking in my sleep. 

Amazon just delivered 6 cases of baby oil, 3 boxes of rubber bands, & a muzzle.
615 2018-02-06 22:43:55 naadik paglalaba, pagkukulay ng buhok at hot oil, body spa... juskels! nawalan ng tulog. hihihi

616 2018-02-06 22:43:52 just made the connection that titanium dioxide - the pigment in my *white oil paint* - is also an active in physical sunscreens, which is why they’re never not ashy and awful 
617 2018-02-06 22:43:35 I love coconut oil lol

620 2018-02-06 22:43:09 People think it could never happen to the UK, but I'd bet the people living in the country with the world's largest proven oil reserves thought the same thing. Alas, look how it's turned out. *Please* think long and hard about what'll happen if it goes wrong.
621 2018-02-06 22:43:06 Beard oil is essential!
622 2018-02-06 22:43:05 In that case I'll pop round with a big bottle of massage oil and give you a full body massage. That should relax your body and mind, you'll soon fall asleep xxx
623 2018-02-06 22:43:05 Did you know that there are hundreds of species of Eucalyptus, about 500 of which produce some kind of essential oil, but only a handful usually are bottled and sold.  If you happen to be "allergic" to Eucalyptus though, and not sure which variety, there are other alternatives.
624 2018-02-06 22:43:02 It will soak up the oil
625 2018-02-06 22:42:26 They do have a point that the pipeline is safer than ships, and oil from outside Canada is substantially more expensive. Plus half the argument the BC government is making is they don’t want more oil ships - which they have to have either way
626 2018-02-06 22:42:11 So here’s the thing...what you say, is meaningless. You’re true colors came out when you’re BIG OIL DONORS came calling for your vote for the #GOPTaxBillScam. YOU SOLD OUT!

631 2018-02-06 22:41:47 President Wyden says that the foreign government of the United States drilling for oil off the coast of OR is illegal.
632 2018-02-06 22:41:47 yo if elon musk helps make rockets running off open source software/hardware that can't be overridden more realistic thats a million times more useful to my long term goals then hoping the arctic ice sheet melts so we can drill for more more oil

634 2018-02-06 22:41:21 There's no "allegedly" about whether or not he took steroids...he did.  In fact, he admitted using steroids, but claimed he thought it was flax seed oil & arthritis cream. I agree that he was on track to be one of the greatest all-time before juicing...but he still cheated.
635 2018-02-06 22:41:13 Perhaps Alberta should ban seafood since it may be scarce after an oil spill anyways. So silly. Still like Albertans!

637 2018-02-06 22:41:00 Part of Nextleaf's business model is based on the fact that most LPs simply throw away trim that could be turned into distillate oil for edibles, vape pens, and topicals. Can't speak for LPs but if they do use tops for oil #YouAreDoingItWrong and should DM me immediately for help
638 2018-02-06 22:40:45 @TomByrneCBD do you have 10%CBD OIL?
639 2018-02-06 22:40:44 My daughter was off school today with a tummy bug, so I'm burning the midnight oil tonight. Though, if I do say so myself, I seem to be smashing it.
640 2018-02-06 22:40:40 Securing oil road will required a campaign but also some investment. Seeing the fact that the RPG7 rocket launcher range is about 900m, building watch towers separated by a distance of 1.4 Km along the road and a military scanner covering the area will be necessary.
641 2018-02-06 22:40:14 Besides adding life to the most common foods, good cooking oil plays a pivotal role in your health. That’s what makes it all the more important to pick the right one.
642 2018-02-06 22:40:10 my dad loves essential oils so much he even puts those air freshener oil things in a car he won’t use

645 2018-02-06 22:39:58  im gonna get the oil change
646 2018-02-06 22:39:48 Democrats have been accusing Republicans/conservatives of "killing" various segments of America, poisoning the air & water, waging war for lies or oil, & shredding the Constitution ... but now, suddenly,  they're worried about hyperbole in political rhetoric.

648 2018-02-06 22:38:59 One time I was stuck in a lift with a group of guys. All with those blue shirts and white collars with braces and hair carrying enough gel to look like penguins after an oil spill, comparing their money clips. I had dark thoughts...
649 2018-02-06 22:38:52 I been at this place getting my oil change for a hr the shit only take 30 mins im mad af
650 2018-02-06 22:38:43 I will say that the fans needed some oil afterwards though, they were the most abused part.
651 2018-02-06 22:38:41 Does Tea tree oil really work as some sort of mosquito repellent guys? Becuase wow.

654 2018-02-06 22:38:06 I got rosehip oil in my eyes but I don't see no roses OR hips. Scam.
655 2018-02-06 22:38:00 Saudi Arabia, world's largest oil producer, plans $300 million solar farm to power 200,000 homes as Trump cuts US clean energy research 70%.
656 2018-02-06 22:37:45 @CalgaryToday Angela, just the same though, why are they hurting the oil industry in Alberta?  Where does it stop?
657 2018-02-06 22:37:38 Donald Trump: 'Disgraceful' that person in US illegally killed Colts player Edwin Jackson:IT'S MUCH MORE OF A DISGRACE FOR A REPEAT 13 YR. OIL GIRL CHILD RAPIST TREASONOUS BAS'TURD'  to have the nerve to set his crooked azz in our new WHITE "SHIT" HOUSE !!!!

659 2018-02-06 22:36:57 Try not to scratch your belly and put coconut oil on it every night before bed
660 2018-02-06 22:36:49 Reuters: According to prosecutors, in April 2012, Sporyshev met an undercover FBI employee (Carter Page) posing as an analyst at a New York energy firm at an oil and gas industry conference.
Over the next two years, they met to discuss the industry and other economic issues.
661 2018-02-06 22:36:20 Exactly. Just like saying Dr Larry Nassar should be boiled in oil doesn't mean you're attacking the Medical Profession
662 2018-02-06 22:36:17 That’s the beauty of making it the law, it wouldn’t matter who is in Government no new licenses for oil and gas exploration could be issued.
663 2018-02-06 22:36:16 Just caught up with @ChrisGPackham In Search of the Lost Girl. Really touching piece of tv and an eye opener to the destruction of rain  forest for palm oil. Makes you realise that our attitudes have got to change.
664 2018-02-06 22:36:14 Fuel reserves are meant to off set price fluctuations and use in emergency shortages. But with government officials owning directly or by proxy oil companies/fuel stations... Conflict of interest is bound to lead to this malady.
665 2018-02-06 22:36:09 You are paid oil man?
666 2018-02-06 22:36:07 There are no "two sides" any more than there are two sides to "the earth is flat". The only people claiming vax cause autism are charlatans and snake oil salesmen. To believe otherwise is to be a gullible fool.

669 2018-02-06 22:35:57 It was inspired by a man shouting at me for putting oil in my car on garage forecourt - ‘Doing a man’s work?! And in a bloody dress’. Curious, what incenses folk. Anyway. It led to much reflection and a funny picture book.
670 2018-02-06 22:35:57 Water will be the next oil..for some. Others will drown in it. Climate change is real!
671 2018-02-06 22:35:53 Salmon ok but lots of oil an my second burnt W noodles. Who can burn a noodle?

674 2018-02-06 22:35:08 Scientists from Yokohama National University in Japan discovered a chemical in McDonald's fry oil to prevent splashing that may be a cure for baldness...one side effect, though, is a bad comb-over in a strange shade of orange....

677 2018-02-06 22:34:50 At the rate @PhadingDark is shoveling fake cancer treatments in my direction, I may have to spin off from "InaneExplanations" in favor of "CancerQuackery"...

While jousting at some sacred cows like cannabis oil.
678 2018-02-06 22:34:47 Pretty convinced he's a liberal automaton constructed by the left wing elite in Canada...the one that sucks oil from South America and runs pipelines into Inuit villages.
679 2018-02-06 22:34:22 Not OK David. Punishing small Canadian businesses and families to support giant oil companies is stupid and childish. I am an NDP er from the time I was a teen but this behaviour is pathetic and doesn't change anything.
680 2018-02-06 22:34:20 Too many oil options I’m overwhelmed
681 2018-02-06 22:34:14 YIPPEE!  The democrats can now win and introduce their AGENDA!  ???  Wait a minute,  what is their AGENDA???  Higher taxes? Higher unemployment?  Less jobs?  More ISIS controlled territories?  More FOREIGN INVADERS (aka: illegal aliens.)?  Less American OIL?  More imports? ???

683 2018-02-06 22:34:06 Polluting coal and oil companies need to be outlawed, they dump toxic sludge into rivers and poisoning our air. They kill innocent wildlife and destroy our communities.
684 2018-02-06 22:33:56 Lmao that’s what you gone be saying when that engine lock up from big putting oil on it
685 2018-02-06 22:33:48 It still taste like old cooking oil.

689 2018-02-06 22:33:25 At least you won’t have to pay for gas or get an oil change
690 2018-02-06 22:33:18 Try an epsom salt bath tonight--just a cup or so of salt with 1-2 tbsp of oil and, if you'd like, a few drops of lavender essential oil. Add some gentle stretching and you should be feeling much better tomorrow.

692 2018-02-06 22:32:56 @RachelNotley if BC doesn't want our oil then cut off the oil supply to them not the wine supply to us! #cutoilnotwine
693 2018-02-06 22:32:54 Actually, it isn't. I know it's hard for an Albertan to understand, but some provinces have economies that don't depend solely on oil and gas.
694 2018-02-06 22:32:52 Awesome. Congrats on the launch. Awesome. @SpaceX
695 2018-02-06 22:32:49 Because they dont support our oil either

698 2018-02-06 22:32:27 It would have been worse and more civilians, elderly, women and children would have been killed without that deal. Stop trying to tie YPG to ISIS when YPG fought ISIS. Erdogan loves his fellow Islamists thats why he bought their oil.
699 2018-02-06 22:32:26 So BC attacks the Alberta oil and gas industry and that's fine...but oh no! Alberta can't do this to BC it's so petty! Good Lord, listen to yourself dimwit..
700 2018-02-06 22:32:25 ((Someday I will draw my son posing like the salt guy with the captions "PUT SALT IN THE PASTA WATER, NOT FUCKING OIL" and print it on a T-shirt and wear it when I go to cons
701 2018-02-06 22:32:24 Well, Teslas don't have engine oil to change.
702 2018-02-06 22:32:09 Half of working Americans make less than 30,000 a year, wall street runs the government, u.s. pushes for illegal wars for oil. 
These are problems. Not some b.s. memos you guys can't let go of. 
Smh only in America
703 2018-02-06 22:32:02 Why don’t you tell him? That’s what FL did & hey guess what - no drilling. No one said “You MUST drill oil!” They just took the restrictions away. States can decide. Oh wait, you’re not used to the republican way. Welcome aboard
704 2018-02-06 22:31:54 Olive oil/peppered butternut squash roasting in an oven is pretty amazing

706 2018-02-06 22:31:45 So basically two major things happened. The thing that holds the oil in the front has been leaking for awhile and eventually the oil hat leashes out like damaged everything. Then there was also a huge crack in the gas tank part so it couldn’t hold gas 
707 2018-02-06 22:31:35 Decomposing fractions; problem/solution text structure; the first bomb in #thewestinggame; writing hooks in informational text; water and oil in the southwest; Mrs. Neira visits!

709 2018-02-06 22:31:31 Okay two things all you anti oil anti pipliners you already have an old line in place this expansion would allow less strain on the old line and allow inspection and repair of old line to avoid a leak. And two Notley you had a couple years to put more effort into this and didnt.
710 2018-02-06 22:31:18 We’ve got a trade war over oil and wine. It’s almost Biblical  #ableg
711 2018-02-06 22:31:04 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
712 2018-02-06 22:31:01 I have been adding eucalyptus oil to hot water and breathing the steam.
I think it is helping. 
I don't think my wife is going to like the smell though.
713 2018-02-06 22:31:00 @Greenangel48067 @Reuters I understand they will actually run completely out in a week or so?. water soon to be the new oil!
714 2018-02-06 22:30:55 Somebody tell Dianne California already has offshore oil drilling.
715 2018-02-06 22:30:55 3yo: Mummy, whys that lorry round?
Me: Its a tanker. The round part holds all sorts of things, like oil or water or flour or gases...

718 2018-02-06 22:30:17 We must hold accountable the oil companies that try to take advantage of trump's despicable lack of restrictions. Hit them in the wallet if we fail in court.

729 2018-02-06 22:29:31 It just keeps getting better. All that glorious, luscious, viscous virgin olive oil.
730 2018-02-06 22:29:24 plus green tech is more jobs per kwh than oil anyways.
731 2018-02-06 22:28:53 You have a oil refinery in los Angeles. Long beach is port of oil tankers. El Segundo is oil pumps everywhere..
732 2018-02-06 22:28:43 I love coconut oil there's so many uses for it. Thanks for introducing me to a new brand.
733 2018-02-06 22:28:40 i just put coconut oil all over my face like a mask kekkrcidndkcjdj
734 2018-02-06 22:28:38 Instead of using our coasts to drill for oil, we should be harnessing them for #cleanenergy creation. The offshore wind industry has the potential to create tens of thousands of jobs up and down the East Coast. And there is no such thing as a tragic wind spill. #ProtectOurCoast
735 2018-02-06 22:28:33 In the opening labeled ‘oil’.  Oil means windshield wiper fluid in German.
736 2018-02-06 22:28:27 I find it amusing that Racheal does this over oil. Just shows that’s all she has to stay in power.
737 2018-02-06 22:27:56 Finally... now cut off the oil tap and watch BC come to a grinding halt.
738 2018-02-06 22:27:37 Better we limit worldwide oil supply to raise prices for Putin. Who is #PutinsPuppet?
California is quickly becoming a 3rd world sh%thole anyway, so your beaches aren't that precious anymore
739 2018-02-06 22:27:29 No. We had a few pathetic feeble flurries between 2-3 but they were short-lived. Probably just as well now the oil has run out again!

744 2018-02-06 22:26:56 So when i was at work yesterday this man walked up to me and showed me a picture of Shea moisture Jamaican black castor oil shampoo and conditioner and asked me where he can get it for his wife. A MAN.

747 2018-02-06 22:26:32 The hive mind at work. Trump says something about the military, the hive sends out its members who served to spout a completely scripted message in order to elicit a particular response. 

If he doesn’t respond, there’ll be another attack tomorrow.
748 2018-02-06 22:26:24 the oil painting like animation is so good
749 2018-02-06 22:26:06 We are definitely seeing more cities and states taking oil and gas companies to court. It's tightening the net to force those companies to change their business plans and pay up.
750 2018-02-06 22:25:51 Just as well we have no oil only ovaries.
751 2018-02-06 22:25:48 And last I checked you can still buy gas, oil, and oil products in BC. Our industries are merely meeting a demand.
752 2018-02-06 22:25:32 At this very moment, that Tesla is about 47000 miles overdue for an oil change
753 2018-02-06 22:25:20 Gentlemen, do yourselves a favor and use beard oil
754 2018-02-06 22:25:17 Stressed at still not working, got messed around by work on Sunday that caused me to panic badly, then it was all for nothing, glad my work mate on the oil rig helped me x
755 2018-02-06 22:25:11 @RachelNotley Hey there, wine is not the toxic crap that is oilseeds oil.  Grow up...
756 2018-02-06 22:25:05 one of the salt crystals and an essential oil you're not allergic too?
757 2018-02-06 22:24:43 i've heard good tings, tea tree oil also good (diluted) if you've not given that a go
758 2018-02-06 22:24:41 Hey good lookin.

I'd can cook you a delicious meal. 

Draw you a bubble bath.

Give you a 80 minute coconut oil massage.

Wrap you in a giant fluffy rope and cuddle you until you fall asleep.
759 2018-02-06 22:24:40 It actually make me sad for those struggling oil executives. They may miss their next mortgage payment...
760 2018-02-06 22:24:33 Not sure if we have one local to me, I'll have to do some investigation, coconut oil makes good lip balm too - you can colour it with melted wax crayons if you want a bit of colour! Ha! Thank you 
761 2018-02-06 22:24:30 You need peppermint oil love
762 2018-02-06 22:24:18 Grape seed oil stink so bad  it smell like lavender
763 2018-02-06 22:24:17 Only a daft partisan hack would actually believe that "...an undercover FBI employee posing as an analyst at a New York energy firm at an oil and gas industry conference..." was anyone other than Carter Page who then wouldn't be livid that his identity was leaked to the NYT.
764 2018-02-06 22:23:55 @kgaladilee let's remind each other to order enough oil for tomorrow's order
765 2018-02-06 22:23:54 Not gone lie this Job boring af but it heavily beats changing tires and oil

769 2018-02-06 22:23:19 The Trump Administration is mired in offshore drilling, the energy of hte past and in the meantime, Elon Musk is pushing ahead with the technology of the present.  Tesla PEV now orbiting the earth showing us our blue planet. End oil addiction. #ProtectOurCoast
770 2018-02-06 22:23:19 @ArnoldClark So much for my car being serviced when I bought it. Luckily I’ve just had it checked - oil cap was fused on. The usual shoddy service and lies!
771 2018-02-06 22:23:18 I’m glad coconut oil is a myth because I’m allergic to coconut and I felt really left out there for a sec
772 2018-02-06 22:23:13 Luckily, Lisa Mullen has a case of Mission Hill Pinot Grigio leftover from the wedding. Since she doesn’t really drink much, we would take a barrel of oil/bitumen per bottle in trade. #WarOfTheRosés #ableg 

And bravo @RachelNotley.
773 2018-02-06 22:23:06 It’s actually not surprising Trump said “I’d love to see a shutdown.”

If there’s one consistency to his leadership style it’s courting chaos.

Which is what people do when they have no leadership style—or ability.

Trump is a conman & he’s turning America into his snake oil.
774 2018-02-06 22:23:05 @TMobile For planning purposes, are you giving away free oil changes any time soon for #TMobileTuesdays? That was my fave AND I need another change now.
775 2018-02-06 22:23:04 « Mot dièse » ? Oh le ringardos.
776 2018-02-06 22:23:02 Snake oil salesmen.
777 2018-02-06 22:22:42 Nice! I usually cut it up, toss it in olive oil & bake it. I like the crunchy little burnt parts, but here i like marinade!
778 2018-02-06 22:22:38 candles/incense/oil burners and an open window on a quiet day. a dog encounter so unexpectedly sweet it reduces me almost to tears. a stone with a hole in it carried just for as long as it's helpful, then left somewhere meaningful. (what IS it about pebbles?)
779 2018-02-06 22:22:37 They’ve also calculated the approximate weight of the contents... 1.7 billion kilos of olive oil over about 250 years.
780 2018-02-06 22:22:25 Ever since i had to pay for that oil change and new tire, my saving has been trash
781 2018-02-06 22:22:24 Udah gede itu rata ratanya dek.Jangan ngebandingin dengan Oil and Gas
782 2018-02-06 22:22:14 I once had a car that I wish were in orbit!! Cost me more for oil than gas
783 2018-02-06 22:22:11 What an amazing view that will be with an oil rig and tankers , progress
784 2018-02-06 22:21:58 Petrocoin Venezuelan crytocurrency backed by oil and gold for the serious smart investors. Can’t get better than Petrocoin. Get it before banks start bail in. Digital currency is an old system used by credit cards. Now, there won’t be a bank between you and your money.

788 2018-02-06 22:21:37 Best analogy of Land Grant debate so far: Rep. Larry Scott calls #NewMexico equivalent of trust fund baby reliant on fed $ and oil & gas. And extra distributions would end in 26 years because of less value of fund. #nmleg #nmpol.
789 2018-02-06 22:21:36 My car won’t start and I’m 100% heated cause I’m sure it’s a result of something done wrong during my oil change today

Yeah, I really want a pork chop.
793 2018-02-06 22:21:15 The go-to person for suggestions on OSTP Director was "former lobbyist for the oil and gas industry"?
Were the former wedding planner, the former reality TV player, and the former Ralph Lauren model unavailable?
794 2018-02-06 22:21:11 Let it be. I’m sure they’ll love equality of outcome in the oil fields, coal mines, construction sites, battlefield, refineries on and on and on.
795 2018-02-06 22:21:06 Here is BC / Alberta mudslinging for next 2 days:

BC - It is the fertile and lush growing environment not only for grapes but for all life that we seek to protect from Alberta tarsands oil pipeline leaks.

AB - Oh yeah. How do you think wine reaches the end customer?

800 2018-02-06 22:20:11 Gas prices went up because oil prices went up.
801 2018-02-06 22:20:07 my legs hurt there is coconut oil in my eye and my dog is crying so how are you
802 2018-02-06 22:20:06 This is disgraceful behaviour!! We, the people of BC, have every right to be thoughtful about our environment! If our surroundings are seriously damaged by oil/bitumen/toxics then there will be huge cost & suffering! And to prevent BC wine coming in, is low!
803 2018-02-06 22:20:04 i use the step 1 skin equalizer from makeup forever! idk if ulta has it tho! but is absorbs the oil and doesn’t dry you out tho
804 2018-02-06 22:20:02 Your bad day at work on the 100weeks100movies list! I can't afford as much lobbying as big oil.
805 2018-02-06 22:19:59 Lmao, was wondering how to integrate the oil
806 2018-02-06 22:19:57 Please! No more bottles of vegetable oil at the front door to clean off black oil from the beach! No moving backwards!
807 2018-02-06 22:19:47 Wondered why rainwater got taxed & gun control happened about the same time mid 90's. Two oil wars?

Khan is their route into who in Board pushed certain decisions - 20 to 30 mins of polite, forensic Q’s on the write-down esp. Middle East contract when writing was on wall re oil price & non-payment would yield names.
815 2018-02-06 22:19:05 Yeah.  It should go the way of Standard Oil and be dissolved into smaller companies.

820 2018-02-06 22:18:15 Has blowout preventer technology advanced in that eight years? BP has oil rigs in even deeper waters now. Have you started an investigation on whether the technology has advanced to make deepwater oil rigs safe?
821 2018-02-06 22:18:10 Like the old saying says, the squeaky wheel gets the oil.
822 2018-02-06 22:17:55 Oil money, it'll buy you what you want.
823 2018-02-06 22:17:49 Not impressed. I feel if BC cares about its water we shouldn't be punishing them for protecting it. This won't woo lure UCP oil votes
824 2018-02-06 22:17:44 Yes, just got an oil drip on my head
825 2018-02-06 22:17:38 Hello i have ford fusion hybrid 2016 i want to change oil..our dealer says it should be 5/20 blinded synthetic while the manual states 0/20 and full synthetic..i'm from Jordan/ middle east VIN 3FA6POLU5GR283287

828 2018-02-06 22:17:20 Plastic is the ultimate front line of the oil industry army. People like the mayor they talk about are the knights in the rear (politicians selling buses, landowners turning crops for alcohol and diesel). 
We might change the engines, but how are we going to replace plastic?
829 2018-02-06 22:17:18 Then it looks like psychopath Erdogan may actually be wanting to separate from the US & NATO. Needs to be stated that he was in league with the US in creating ISIS, he profited from the oil they stole & carried out his orders to kill Kurdish separatists.
830 2018-02-06 22:17:06 I propose the Ab gvt consider the 100k +/- unemployed oil workers here by trying to entice all the foriegn owners of our oilsands to come back. Just sayin.

832 2018-02-06 22:16:39 had a look at that, but again i just don’t want another item to wash. going to try a bit of oil on the foil
833 2018-02-06 22:16:20 Stop running large budget deficits to fix the problem of increasing debt. Industrial countries has dropped in the GDP per capita ranking, but all the countries that are now in front of us are either small oil countries, small financial centers, or small corporate tax havens.
834 2018-02-06 22:16:05 @premierofbc @RachelNotley @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @CBCMorningLive  Again a big congrats to the gov. of BC for fighting for Canada!

835 2018-02-06 22:16:04 yes refining would cost more here but no transportation cost reduces cost some, and jobs ensuing would certainly be a boon for the economy, $ from exports mostly go to big oil not our citizens
836 2018-02-06 22:15:57 I think we should all sue the oil & gas companies for polluting our air, water & soil! Causing massive environmental issues, health issues & standing in the way of solar & wind technologies for decades! Causing water contamination w/pipelines on sacred land!
837 2018-02-06 22:15:54 Gas prices being up is bad for consumers but good for ppl in oil industry. Gas is up because oil is more expensive which means oil companies will start hiring back ppl that got laid off when oil was down
838 2018-02-06 22:15:54 HB1251 and SB726 just passed in the House and Senate, respectively.

Medical THC oil will soon be legal in Virginia.

840 2018-02-06 22:15:46 creams are always good. generally, i dont have too much of anything--moderation is key. speaking of creams, i switched from cream sauce to plain olive oil for pasta, that was huge for me, but i like it better now.

842 2018-02-06 22:15:42 Peppermint works well for me. Either essential oil or tea or candy. Just peppermint.
843 2018-02-06 22:15:41 So...Indiana legislators, my students will be able to buy cannabis oil, but they can't have free speech?? #gofigure
844 2018-02-06 22:15:32 Look,as a Muslim, I dont force my religion or belief on anyone, mind you,I'm not living the way my brain n mind dim fit,I live my life the way Allah has instructed me,as a follower of his religion, I need no ones opinion on how I'm to live my life ,if u CNT respect, kip shut
845 2018-02-06 22:15:28 Like the BP Oil spill under Obammy, that took over a month to cap. Time to retire Granny.
846 2018-02-06 22:15:27 @OilandEnergy is one of the best sites on the Internet for energy news, especially on oil and gas. Mandatory reading in the morning.
847 2018-02-06 22:15:15 I'm really enjoying Alberta's tactics to get British Columbia to realize they making a huge mistake with the pipeline issue. #BCPoli #ABLeg #ABPoli @RachelNotley means business! We NEED a pipeline... The oil gonna be moved regardless... Why do it for 1/5th of world prices?!?
848 2018-02-06 22:15:06 Oil? Aww poor Aloth, everyone gets these nice meals and then “Here, have a bottle of oil, it’ll make your fireballs bigger!”
849 2018-02-06 22:15:00 Silly that BC would rather have their oil shipped in on boats or on trains then support our own country.  Is this what Canada has become?
850 2018-02-06 22:14:53 Yes I would love to try this Coconut oil. I’ve heard that coconut  oil has a ton of uses. Anything from skin care to hair care!! It looks amazing #dailygoodiebox
851 2018-02-06 22:14:51 So you don't want to be energy self sufficient as a nation and would rather rely on foreign oil cartels to dictate terms? Thanks Senator.
852 2018-02-06 22:14:50 Yesterday, we woke up around 1800 & decided to go out for dinner. The bf had fallen asleep later because he went to Honda for an oil change & tire rotation (he's the best ). I yelped it & found Mezza Grille & it didn't take much convincing because it had mango stuffed chicken
853 2018-02-06 22:14:31 wait, they’re holding wine hostage because they don’t want anyone looking more closely at the risks of an oil pipeline? wth
854 2018-02-06 22:14:24 Despite oil boom and the good allocations he was getting den. He could still make judicious use.
855 2018-02-06 22:14:13 Cause pitting billions in oil exports against millions in wine exports is good business
856 2018-02-06 22:14:06 im using oils, but finding  detailed fine work very very hard and have been using oil to make it more fluid. Only started painting last year. 
On canvas or board
857 2018-02-06 22:13:59 I just unfollowed him. Shady tweet ethics in breaking news. Snake oil like lol
858 2018-02-06 22:13:53 The whole fam using essential oil diffusers because of ME  @danielaa_slzr “get on the wave”
859 2018-02-06 22:13:34 Alberta makes wine? What do they distill it from petroleum?

We can ultimately develop our own oil reserves and buy oil from the USA and Russia. We don't need Alberta Alberta needs us
860 2018-02-06 22:13:28 Interesting position, Alta can stop the flow of goods (Wine and Electricity)into its province but if BC does the same (Oil) it's somehow unconstitutional and criminal
861 2018-02-06 22:13:28 We finally got all caught up on @NBCChicagoMed.  Doctor Rhodes and I have similar tastes in fancy sports cars.    (But, of course, mine would have machine guns, rocket launchers, oil slick, etc., etc.)  cc @IntlSpyMuseum
862 2018-02-06 22:13:24 Yeah i get it from time to time. Essential oil rubs do help
863 2018-02-06 22:13:23 Tryna make nsima and accidentally added oil to the water smh
864 2018-02-06 22:13:19 @PnPCBC Why will our PM not stand up to the unconstitutional move by the BC Govt. To block the export of oil products?
865 2018-02-06 22:13:12 The Republicans only concern is with big Oil! If we really wish to ( cap  the beast ) then we must be willing to go all in for clean  alternative energy. No more drilling! No more Fracking ! All in for clean and renewable energy!
866 2018-02-06 22:13:12 Right! Alberta has squandered the $billions from oil while other jurisdictions built up huge heritage funds. Now you demand that your neighbours allow a huge increase in shipments of a truly destructive material.

They ain't letting no #Patriotism get in the way
870 2018-02-06 22:12:52 Kiehls beard oil is insanely good, but quite pricey 
871 2018-02-06 22:12:44 Have all your petty arguments about oil and pipelines, just don't mess with the wine, please. Thank you. #pnpcbc #cdnpoli #abpoli #bcpoli
872 2018-02-06 22:12:29 My suggestion is that the NY City Major suspend all gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and heating oil sales immediately and go buy a new hat.
873 2018-02-06 22:12:28 I guess all the oil drilled on the gulf coast should stay down south then and let you people deal with gas lines.
874 2018-02-06 22:12:27 تسلم ايدك احلى من أمس
875 2018-02-06 22:12:24 Yes! That way republicans can deregulate everything and kill more Americans slowly with bad laws. Including electing cadet bone spur. 
You do know the oil industry is drilling holes in the earth off the coast of Washington state. Yep let them eat oil sandwiches.
876 2018-02-06 22:12:07 Why Counsel Portfolio Services Inc Reported United States Diesel-Heating Oil Fund Positio...
877 2018-02-06 22:12:05 Just walk away. Give me your pump, the oil, the gasoline, and the whole compound, and I'll spare your lives.

(Sorry, I can only think of one!)
878 2018-02-06 22:12:05 They best be slick as he & Jr. a length, they are willing to have it just they're way.  Remember lady's its a Man's World.  :) Reinforce the Native American Reservation land ownership and rights. Do not allow grease balls to destroy over big oil.  Pictures speak a thousand words.
879 2018-02-06 22:11:41 #ProtectOurCoast Fuck the Coast bring up the Oil and Gas!
880 2018-02-06 22:11:38 Thanks. I will look for the oil. Is that used as an ointment or internally?
881 2018-02-06 22:11:35 like was that baby oil or what
882 2018-02-06 22:11:27 Stupid to celebrate palm-tree assisted desertification. Nut paste can be infinitely tastier, richer and satisfyer as well as married with the best cocoas, than this rude product, without any subtitly. Better sip a can of oil with a cuo of sugar, samed primary satisfaction !
883 2018-02-06 22:11:27 2.Come back up when things are booming again and there is a labour shortage. Thanks to Notley and the myriad policy items that hurt this industry, it’s allowed the big 5 to consolidate their position and pushed out smaller to midsize players. Of course big oil co’s support carbon
884 2018-02-06 22:11:19 Having an oil to wear under my foundation again is a life saver
885 2018-02-06 22:11:18 Why you still reppin the O when your on the  oil?
886 2018-02-06 22:11:12 Ironically, the “next neighbour” to take US oil exports is a core OPEC nation!!! #UAE bought a cargo of American #oil in December, according to US Census Bureau trade data. Most likely super light shale oil to replace Qatar condensate?
887 2018-02-06 22:11:12 Can’t help feeling, in the case of Porsche, that extending service intervals and prolonging oil changes have lead to some of the engine problems
888 2018-02-06 22:11:05 I am coated in almond oil, feel like a lovely slick walrus rn
889 2018-02-06 22:11:05 What brand of cream or oil did you use reduce stretch marks?

894 2018-02-06 22:10:25 Sitting in traffic for one hour to move 12 miles isnt very #Green either...and dont get me started over fuel prices when A) oil is $50/barrel (last time it was gas was $1.90/gal) PLUS B) we MAKE GAS HERE!!! #SignalHill
895 2018-02-06 22:10:19 $1.50 is up? When big oil gets 11 billion?
896 2018-02-06 22:10:14 バターとかマーガリンとか知らないけど多分吸ったぜ。
897 2018-02-06 22:10:07 Consistency may be the oil, but variety is the spice of living. Don’t limit your options by subscribing too literally to the idea that you must be consistent. The rules should be steady; the consequences of violating them can vary.
898 2018-02-06 22:09:55 Need to stop fucking around and get an oil change this weekend
899 2018-02-06 22:09:42 honestly i don't need anything more than perfectly acidic and bitter olive oil
900 2018-02-06 22:09:41 Quit selling oil to New York. They'll be begging for them to come back in a week when they are starving and rioting.
901 2018-02-06 22:09:37 He should try to do an oil painting of it instead
902 2018-02-06 22:09:24 Are you trying to cook your girlfriend ? use jojoba oil it’s MUCH better
903 2018-02-06 22:09:17 Hi @NandosUK! Am currently sat in your Farringdon branch watching your staff pour red goop into empty @HeinzKetchup_US bottles and vegetable oil into olive oil bottles.  Cost saving?

911 2018-02-06 22:08:19 ...do NOT use tea tree oil for any reason on your dog.  Some people have done this, and it has resulted in burns, temporary paralysis, even kidney failure.  A dog's physiology is sensitive.  Hope this helps!

913 2018-02-06 22:08:13 Yeah, that is his plan I fear...to slow down green power so his coal and oil buddies can keep screwing us and the planet.
914 2018-02-06 22:08:09 You know what? Am not a dark conspiracies fan, but maybe when Western governments seriously dig into alternative sources of energy and stop bowing before their oil barons, Middle Eastern masters and their "peaceful" crowds will lose their impetus.

935 2018-02-06 22:06:34 But profitability still precarious, and oil cos are having now to fund massive decommissioning bills, further eating into profits (cos helped tho by uk govt tax breaks, that Indy Scot gov could not afford to fund - so Indy would cripple oil cos more).
936 2018-02-06 22:06:32 We work with our suppliers to ensure that ingredients used in our products, including palm kernel oil, are sourced responsibly.
937 2018-02-06 22:06:27 Hi @jjhorgan @clairetrevena @GeorgeHeyman Time to develop aggressive plan to move away from oil. Start by massive investments in fossil free transportation: electric rail, buses and passenger ferries plus cycling and walking. Plus more people will be able to safely enjoy BC wine.
938 2018-02-06 22:06:16 Ok yeah but the tECHNIQUE OF BATTERING A PIECE OF CHEESE AND FRYING IT IN HOT OIL IS THE SAME THING. And I'm pretty sure the country dealing with Civil War and getting fucked by the English is gonna have peACE PRIZES.

957 2018-02-06 22:04:19 Haha! There's no palm oil in Doritos! It would be listed in the ingredients if it was, it's definitely not listed on the back of UK Doritos.
958 2018-02-06 22:04:12 Sure. I'm just hoping they lower the price to 80% of "Men's Doritos" because we make 80% less than men. (Oh - and take out the conflict palm oil, too.)
959 2018-02-06 22:04:09 For lunch today I made mac n cheese. As it was boiling I added just a little olive oil and some crushed red pepper. Drained it, stirred in milk, butter, powdered cheese. Added shredded cheddar, shredded Italian blend cheese, and feta. Stirred in over heat. 
960 2018-02-06 22:04:09 What a joke.  Get over it, the oil industry is a dying one.  Take your politically-motivated rhetoric elsewhere.

978 2018-02-06 22:02:51 To offset inflation and quickly rising gas prices will be the bigger part of the paycheck. If thats even the case for folks who are lucky enough. How is it we export oil and drop oil piping throughout the US sacrificing nature's dignity, but gas never gets cheaper?
979 2018-02-06 22:02:49 Every petty-ass decision she makes just proves the Alberta government to be more and more up the oil industry’s ass…
980 2018-02-06 22:02:45 New Smyrna is absolutely the best place for a shark attack I recommend all libs visit and don’t forget your fish oil sunscreen
981 2018-02-06 22:02:38 Tired of all the whining from Alberta anyway. Time to get off oil and develop a real economy.
982 2018-02-06 22:02:34 They’ve been sold snake oil eh, @txchoices ? #OpportunityCost
983 2018-02-06 22:02:26 Stop I swear  and invest in some good oil free face wash because you’re gonna feel pretty greasy after every shift
984 2018-02-06 22:02:21 Honestly, I feel like I can do an oil change myself
985 2018-02-06 22:02:18 "Weak non-energy trade also means Cd is increasingly depending on oil to keep its trade balance from deteriorating further, despite Trudeau’s efforts to pivot away from commodities.

986 2018-02-06 22:02:10 Good to know. I only use coconut oil on my face
987 2018-02-06 22:01:48 Winning is the goal. Period. If you can't understand that, then please enjoy a possible nuke event, voter suppression, oil rigs every 2 miles of shore, cancer causing and bee-killing pesticide coated vegetables (previously illegal in a Dem admin)courtesy TrumpCo and have a seat.
988 2018-02-06 22:01:39 Pennsylvania Gov Tom Wolf has called for severence tax for the oil and gas industry
989 2018-02-06 22:01:25 we laugh at the ppl who used to buy snake oil, yet we still hire ppl who call themselves as social media influencers
990 2018-02-06 22:01:23 And oil price increased :)
991 2018-02-06 22:01:16 むりしないで..

@ponticelli, 

Good to meet representatives from @fluor  and @ponticelli today at pearl of african hotel . Key focus from the workshop today was the opportunities available as service providers in the oil and gas sector of Uganda.

@Pau
993 2018-02-06 22:01:01 ' Or, 'How many rat tails are in minkerfoils?' 'Produce anti-matter.' Again, Harry, with the oil of Olivier, acts humble, demure even, thankful for the lesson. He controls his urge to slay Snake's ears with a few fiery riffs off his wand.
994 2018-02-06 22:01:01 Actually, the correct pluralization is cajuputs oil.
995 2018-02-06 22:00:51 I tell you, I've been googling stuff all day about a health issue. Every single alternative treatment has had a mix of 'this will fix it' , 'this will make it worse' and this is a carcinogen.

Even bloody flax seed oil causes cancer apparently

998 2018-02-06 22:00:26 February 06, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
999 2018-02-06 22:00:24 Olive oil all the way sir....only a madman would use anything other
1000 2018-02-06 22:00:23 Ooops u just disqualified yourself. U can't buy her.
1001 2018-02-06 22:00:19 OIL DIFF: 3.56 -> 3.63
1002 2018-02-06 22:00:17 @Pepsi PepsiCo, stop trying to sidestep your enormous Conflict Palm Oil problem. Rainforests continue to fall and workers continue to be exploited for the palm oil in your products and in the operations of your notorious business partner Indofood.--
1003 2018-02-06 22:00:13 Yep. Stand firm against oil drilling. @SenWhitehouse
1004 2018-02-06 21:59:54 Cod liver oil is good for you! ... According to a fish oil sauces
1005 2018-02-06 21:59:49 So they did take it, BAILOUT money at that while Tesla was a loan, paid off. Another example?

And you must have never lived next to fossil proc. facility. Nor visited a country whos govt is literally propped up by oil. Need I mention real reason US govt waged WAR in Iraq too?
1006 2018-02-06 21:59:46 Ima wash her hair tonight when she on the bath and massage her scalp then put oil in it
1007 2018-02-06 21:59:26 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.

1009 2018-02-06 21:59:00 Condition it once a day with argan oil or this detangler from Shea moisture.. My daughter was this way too, it will take time to straighten out bc she's laying with her head on surfaces quite a bit. It will get easier just takes time.
1010 2018-02-06 21:58:56 Q: has oil or gas been discovered on the Oregon Coast? I'd be shocked because it's so geologically active. Scientists had their instruments covered by fresh lava. An oil well into the subduction zone wouldn't last.
1011 2018-02-06 21:58:44 Syria and Russia signed an agreement in Moscow to cooperate in the energy sector to implement projects related to oil and gas fields, phosphate mines and others. The two countries are also working to undertake electricity projects together.
1012 2018-02-06 21:58:31 @Oil_Pal hey, who do I call to talk through installation as I have a few questions. Thanks
1013 2018-02-06 21:58:27 This was a problem created by the auto / oil gas industry getting rid of environmental protection legislation while at the same time securing subsidies. Tesla is environmentally friendly, but it’s tanking workers rights and accumulating capital to fewer people.
1014 2018-02-06 21:58:25 We love coconut oil in our house! @DailyGoodieBox y'all are awesome! Hoping I'll be lucky enough to get a box one day!
1015 2018-02-06 21:58:24 The dumb dumbs are alive. Huge distillate build. More mediocre demand. But they only look at one number.
1016 2018-02-06 21:58:22 If you believe this show, I have some snake oil for u
1017 2018-02-06 21:58:20 i hate using oil pastels im the only one that cant get it smooth in my art cLASS
1018 2018-02-06 21:57:46 Lemon baking chips, Greek yogurt baking chips, toasted coconut. And a bag of avocado oil chips.
1019 2018-02-06 21:57:38 It’s always something. Got new tires about a month ago. Yesterday mycar was driving really weird and I realized I needed an oil change, so my bf goes to take my car and my tire is completely flat like hanging off. So his dad in law takes by car to get a new tire, now corrosion 
1020 2018-02-06 21:57:21 Good, take the billions you've paid to the oil companies and Rex Tillerson and fund the military. That would be the right thing to do. But you don't do the right thing. You do the Republican thing.
1021 2018-02-06 21:57:16 What's up? Stocks. (Not oil.)
Dow Jones Ind: 24,912.77, +567.02, +2.3%  
S&P 500: 2,695.14, +46.20, +1.7%

1022 2018-02-06 21:57:01 omg in my toxicology class we are studying toxicants in cosmetics and my professor brought in coconut oil and was like use this instead of lotion or you might die how precious
1023 2018-02-06 21:56:59 "Christmas Cactus"  oil on panel - 24" x 24"
1024 2018-02-06 21:56:52 Does that trick work with oil too?
1025 2018-02-06 21:56:49 Should have mentioned both have used CBD oil rather than edibles.
1026 2018-02-06 21:56:48 Pigment powder with linseed oil as binder. This can be used both opaque and transparent. Both have been applied. Due to more or less pigment you get tint differences. Is very laborous. That's why i have been working on this drawing for so long
1027 2018-02-06 21:56:42 Wine vs. oil. @RachelNotley takes next step in ongoing battle between Alberta and BC over bitumen by telling AGLC to halt import of BC wines. #bcpoli
1028 2018-02-06 21:56:38 This has shocked me. It is sad this is happening in UK in 2018 and situation so different from Europe. My mother born in 1927 was brought up on daily doses of cod liver oil. The delivered messages must have been clearer back then.
1029 2018-02-06 21:56:32 Grease'm with coconut oil, dunk'm in nutritional yeast, and ta-da... home made un-brie-lievables.
1030 2018-02-06 21:56:25 As if we needed to do anything else to de incentivize work, say goodbye to the West and all that oil the east needs
1031 2018-02-06 21:56:24 "If you drill, you will spill. Imagine during Superstorm Sandy if we had oil rigs off the coast of NJ. We would have had spills." @SenatorMenendez #ProtectOurCoast
1032 2018-02-06 21:56:18 How many animals have been killed clearing the rainforests to produce the coconut oil used to make this!
1033 2018-02-06 21:56:14 Olive oil isn't supposed to go "plop plop" like sludge! This relentless frigid cold has crept into the bones of my house and now my bottle of olive oil has congealed in my cupboard. Congealed. I know it's okay to use, but it's gross.
1034 2018-02-06 21:56:03 oh my god this shampoo felt like a bottle of olive oil but my hair never looked this good
1035 2018-02-06 21:55:59 Can’t believe everyone is celebrating us throwing a car into space.  We ruined the ocean with oil spills we might as well ruin space as wel.
1036 2018-02-06 21:55:55 ささきかと思ったらくたびれたおっさんだった
1037 2018-02-06 21:55:46 Ohh another good one-shaved carrots, chopped red onions, snow peas, diced pineapples and soy sauce, olive oil. Cauliflower fried rice!!
1038 2018-02-06 21:55:43 I know two people with arthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and osteoarthritis) who have found CBD oil to be life changing. No exaggeration.
1039 2018-02-06 21:55:34 It doesn't pair well for Notley with the restrictions BC has proposed on Alberta's oil
1040 2018-02-06 21:55:31 The Trump drilling plan harms everyone except Big Oil. Big thanks to @senatormenendez for standing up for NJ fisheries, coastal communities and marine life #ProtectOurCoast.
1041 2018-02-06 21:55:21 Coconut oil!!
1042 2018-02-06 21:55:17 "Trump drilling plan ignores everyone except Big Oil." @SenatorMenendez "If you are drilling on federal lands and waters you should keep it here to keep the price down and to keep energy security."  #ProtectOurCoast
1043 2018-02-06 21:55:04 My bf took my car to get an oil change so I can nap longer and he’s the best in the world I could cry
1044 2018-02-06 21:54:57 i’ve gotten to a point where i don’t care if my clothes is dirty because my shirts and pants have paint or oil pastel or something on them so whatever
1045 2018-02-06 21:54:57 So off #Oregon Coast near Haystack Rock is a vast oil reservoir? Funny I have never read a thing about this find.
1046 2018-02-06 21:54:51 Luckily my heating oil supplier ran a special offer so I had a top-up. I might be running the heating a little longer over the next day or so! So glad I work from home! #GalwayHour
1047 2018-02-06 21:54:19 bio oil helps with scars for me
1048 2018-02-06 21:54:09 I prefer to eat natural healthy food not processed vegetable oil that that has been transported half way round the world
1049 2018-02-06 21:54:08 Most already know but the Josh McDaniels introductory press conference will be at 4pm tomorrow at Lucas Oil, and I cannot wait for @GreggDoyelStar ‘s first question!  #Colts #ColtsNation #ColtStrong
1050 2018-02-06 21:54:07 @GM highly upsetting that I took my GMC Sierra 1500 Denali to the dealership for an oil leak, and broken engine mount that ended up costing $1800 for the repair. I paid it but when I went to start the vehicle and drive home, now the check engine light is on with trouble starting
1051 2018-02-06 21:53:57 Apparently, fixing a car means that I can recall all sorts of things from my youth. But mainly Lady Macbeth's "Out, damned spot" speech, trying to get oil and crap off my hands. Stupid, useless, eloquent English Literature GCSE.
1052 2018-02-06 21:53:46 I hate to burst your bubble but money does not grow on trees. Fact: Alberta is so entrenched in the oil industry it would be the poorest province without it. We couldnt even pay for proper waste disposal and enforcement. Rivers would turn toxic with garbage and sewage.
1053 2018-02-06 21:53:45 Think of it this way - all that wine needs to be transported. By not bringing it here we're helping BC reduce the amount of oil we need to send to them!
1054 2018-02-06 21:53:43 I was 2,000 miles over my oil change....my mechanic was not v happy. But was happy that my car didn’t blow up 
1055 2018-02-06 21:53:40 Cricket score for spurs when they turn up at the cabbage patch that is 'the crown oil (shed) arena'. Fucking shit that our game has been moved to a Tuesday now. Still take over their town like usual #oafc
1056 2018-02-06 21:53:39 1. Straight cut
2. Skin off
3. Olive Oil
1057 2018-02-06 21:53:36 You and I must live on different planets. Because here on earth, lots of resources are getting scarcer, including: fresh water, coal, oil, and natural gas. According to the UN, by 2025, 1.8B people won’t have access to fresh water. But keep having babies!
1058 2018-02-06 21:53:27 Most of #MidCityNOLA was once zoned industrial along the Greenway, does that mean we have to let factories and oil refineries locate there? Nope. We went through the democratic process to update laws and grandfathered historical uses to protect existing owners' rights.
1059 2018-02-06 21:53:21 Now that you put it that way. It's where the family enjoys vacationing to get away from the hustle and bustle of D.C. Oil derricks wouldn't be cool. It'd be like steaming around the Arabian Gulf again.
1060 2018-02-06 21:52:58 The current price for Heating Oil is $2.399 per gallon.
1061 2018-02-06 21:52:54 It's funny. They either ignore me or accuse me of being a bot for Big Oil. One day I WILL be a real boy.
1062 2018-02-06 21:52:49 What? French fry oil could cure baldness?
1063 2018-02-06 21:52:45 and - BC Vinyards all in the interior.  vast majority of opposition to AB oil is on the coast and island.   ...attacking the wrong people.
1064 2018-02-06 21:52:42 Doesn’t coconut oil make it tastier?
1065 2018-02-06 21:52:41 I got it in a oil and it taste like a sunday/ bubble gum its 
1066 2018-02-06 21:52:40 She looks like Asmau in QS,ABU
1067 2018-02-06 21:52:16 I'll trade you some oil for some wine
1068 2018-02-06 21:52:13 Does @elrufai mean other resources aside oil will be put  in custody of states where they are found?  I am not clear with his position on how those resources will be restructured
1069 2018-02-06 21:52:08 Pretty sure they use canola oil...
1070 2018-02-06 21:51:51 MAY AS WELL INCLUDE PAGE'S FATHER WHO DOES OIL BUSINESS WITH RUSSIA ALL THE TIME.
1071 2018-02-06 21:51:44 Sensually rubbing my vessel with oil and unconditional love is such a sacred ritual.
1072 2018-02-06 21:51:43 Report from 4 yrs ago :-) exports have though fallen recently, due to oil price mainly. and doesn’t answer the higher public spending issue.
1073 2018-02-06 21:51:43 Me too! The interactions between high/low NG and oil prices with high/low renewables and storage prices would be particularly revealing.
1074 2018-02-06 21:51:40 Use of oil must stop altogether
1075 2018-02-06 21:51:28 Mix quinoa with cabbage, tomatoes &amp; cucumber for a healthy and refreshing salad. Top with 1 tbsp olive oil and fresh squeezed lemon!!
1076 2018-02-06 21:51:16 オリーブ油で毎日を楽しく(*^_^*)
1077 2018-02-06 21:51:03 As long as it doesn't take out a passenger ferry or an oil tanker it should be good.
1078 2018-02-06 21:50:53 ((I use Italian herb olive oil to make microwave popcorn, drizzle it with some more of the healthy stuff and shake on some dried herbs with a pinch of garlic salt. Fuckin' tasty.))
1079 2018-02-06 21:50:52 Hey @RachelNotley, how on earth can you call yourself "NDP" as you spout off about free trade, gloss over the environment, and suck up to oil companies? We'll defend our coast here in BC from the devastating impact of oil spills. It's ours, not yours. #bcpoli #abpoli #ableg #ndp
1080 2018-02-06 21:50:41 もう出勤している人たちを見て、死が歩み寄ってくるのをひしひしと感じている

1082 2018-02-06 21:50:11 olive oil it is, aint no man got time to make a watery gravy
1083 2018-02-06 21:50:04 Love cooking with coconut oil! Also I bake with it.
1084 2018-02-06 21:50:00 Go to subway and order a chicken,bacon and ranch flatbread w/ spinach, tomatoes, onions, salt/pepp, oregano, oil/vinegar, and ranch 
1085 2018-02-06 21:49:53 You mean the tax reform that has taken money from my business to give to wealthy oil companies? Or is it the tax reform that has the stock market doing so well the last week?
1086 2018-02-06 21:49:53 I only eat man Doritos, not Doritas,  chain saw oil flavor, or '76 Camaro with lime.
1087 2018-02-06 21:49:50 Did you empty the oil pan?
1088 2018-02-06 21:49:39 Oregonians don’t want their view of Haystack Rock marred by oil derricks. #ProtectthePacific
1089 2018-02-06 21:49:39 Lots of "It's UK oil", as Brexit costs dawn on England, which NEED Scots oil to bail them out. Again.McCrone silenced to bail out  UK bankruptcy

1094 2018-02-06 21:48:51 I really want oil down man 
1095 2018-02-06 21:48:42 UPDATE to oil story: CEO Mary Price sent a cleanup crew to house, but family is still stuck with footing hotel bill & w/out a home @fox5dc
1096 2018-02-06 21:48:26 Senator: Why do you demand that we buy oil from people who want to kill us?  Why don’t you have faith in Americans to harvest oil responsibility?  Are you just “resisting” again. You never have any answers just complaints.
1097 2018-02-06 21:48:23 Ahhh to late they r all taken
1098 2018-02-06 21:48:14 Preferable to whale oil.  However perhaps chucking stuff away after 1 use  & focus on cancerous overgrowth instead of sustainability/manageability is a mistake?
1099 2018-02-06 21:48:05 @stacie_stewart Stacie, I have just bought the How to lose weight well book. Fantastic recipes. Just wondered is there anything else I can use instead of coconut oil in banana bread and the loaf cake?
1100 2018-02-06 21:48:01 The second I read any skincare thread that includes lemon juice or coconut oil I report it for harassment and spam
1101 2018-02-06 21:48:00 Me: Mom remember when you had Angel and I take Fish oil pills everyday before school?

3. Vegetable or sunflower oil?
1105 2018-02-06 21:47:22 @oceanexplorer please join the group of brave senators now opposing expanded offshore exploration/drilling for oil and gas. You better than most will know the damage such activities can cause to the ocean ecosystems our planet depends on.

1106 2018-02-06 21:47:15 @theresa_may  knows... She backs the US who funds @netanyahu  to expand in the Middle East.. For oil, and control of all. The US wants to control globally. We will all pay the price$$$$$
@jeremycorbyn a threat to the wants of &   
1107 2018-02-06 21:47:10 Baby have to get my oil change before next Week thats when I need it
1108 2018-02-06 21:47:04 Rosehip oil as a moisturizer >>> 

@LaBeautyologist taught me.
1109 2018-02-06 21:47:01 now there's crocodile oil???  e..excuse me?
1110 2018-02-06 21:46:57 I’m now fantisizing about such a scent in one of those warm oil diffuser things. 
1111 2018-02-06 21:46:54 Pure agony. I'm thinking of trying cannabis oil next time. I hope it eases up soon.
1112 2018-02-06 21:46:53 This would be like buying a used white pickup truck after the oil crashed!
1113 2018-02-06 21:46:51 growin my hair out, but i need a line up
i prefer k, but the coke like a lion 
drop a bar in my coffee 
hash oil like toffee
1114 2018-02-06 21:46:47 Don't know, but why are gas prices so high? Thought Trumpie is Mr. Oil N Gas, shouldn't prices be dropping? Maybe once he opens up national parks to oil.
1115 2018-02-06 21:46:19 For a vegetarian you sure have a warped view. He may placate your racist fantasies but he's awful on the environment. Best day of your life? You happy that scientific research is being slashed; Arctic will be ruined for oil; Exxon guy runs the State Dept; an polluter runs the EPA
1116 2018-02-06 21:46:18 Thanks to @INSAlliance member Kristin Reif of @InsidePMI for sharing insights on national security implications of #tobacco smuggling at #FIISWG. Amazingly, the value of smuggled tobacco exceeds the combined value of smuggled oil, wildlife, timber, cultural property, & diamonds.
1117 2018-02-06 21:46:03 I havent tried Coconut Oil yet, but would love to! Ive heard such great things. Im a lil behind i guess...lol
1118 2018-02-06 21:46:02 Love the easy and wonderful packaging this coconut oil comes in. What a great way to bring it with you to add a little moisture to dry skin, or put in diaper bag to help with the butt! Even to add healthy oil to your food! #dailygoodiebox

1120 2018-02-06 21:45:55 Notley doesn't think wine folks see their industry as laughable compared to oil. "But we need to make a point." They sell their product into Alberta, and it will hurt them. #ableg
1121 2018-02-06 21:45:44 guess i will have to do this but wanted there to be a way w/o using oil
1122 2018-02-06 21:45:43 Love this. While Chrissy is defending a guy posting fake videos he can't recall posting, @elonmusk - who CK called a snake oil salesman (solar in SA, end of days) - just launched the largest rocket since the Apollo missions. #seriously #outofhisdepth

1133 2018-02-06 21:44:36 I think maybe I’ve tried stuff with coconut oil in it, but none of the other stuff. My castor oil is getting delivered today so I better be Gucci 3-6 months from now lol
1134 2018-02-06 21:44:27 Coconut oil is a big staple in my house from food prep, smoothies, skin/hair/nail care & natural furniture polish.Thanks for sharing @DailyGoodieBox

1136 2018-02-06 21:44:26 Watching deep water horizon proves to me how much large bodies of water scares me and oil rigs.
1137 2018-02-06 21:44:21 Tit for tat won’t help anything. Then again, nothing will help. In the era of no compromise entrenchment identity politics, nothing will get a thumbs up from BC on oil and gas development from Alberta. So might as well quit pretending.
1138 2018-02-06 21:44:13 “The police acted stupidly” “cling to your guns and religion” “if I had a son” “you’ll save 2,500 a year” “redline” “terrorists on the run” “spread the wealth around” “I’ve doubled our exports” “I didn’t raise taxes once” “we import more oil today than ever before”. that enough?

1160 2018-02-06 21:41:30 So you want the government to intervene and force the oil companies to pay you more!? SOCAILIST! The free market determines what you are worth per hour my friend. Your probably right that Jr. oil & gas companies will lag in automation, they also pay poorly. #ableg
1161 2018-02-06 21:41:16 Risk reward ratio for offshore drilling is obvious.
Oil production is inherently dangerous.
1162 2018-02-06 21:40:50 due to the seasonality of heating oil’s crack spread, i guess.

1165 2018-02-06 21:40:47 Research on olive oil has been primarily focused on its cardiovascular support. However, a growing amount of research in the last decade has shown that is also reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease.

1187 2018-02-06 21:38:30 Exactly because government bodies want Canada to buy foreign oil rather then use our own. If we did use our own, guess what? Those same environmentalists would still yell and scream like 4yr olds like they did at this town hall meeting...even if it meant less pipelines.

1192 2018-02-06 21:37:59 Oh. Well there's several ways you can reduce the resin. Most people tend to use oil to fill the bottom, and then float the resin on the top. The risk of the resin curing in my vat is extremely minimal though. Something as simple as a piece of cardboard on top will stop it

1265 2018-02-06 21:30:11 Never take MCT oil before a workout. I have never been so bloated 
1266 2018-02-06 21:30:03 We should set up a oil game to watch for all van island Oiler Twitter .. would be super fun!!

1269 2018-02-06 21:29:36 How is it that all these politicians fall for the Moslem taqiyyah?  Must be all that oil money greasing a lot of palms.
1270 2018-02-06 21:29:22 Jeff texts me with “ the oil lights on” iv been telling him for a month now to get an oil change he don’t wanna listen , mind you his in Middletown right now
1271 2018-02-06 21:29:15 In my entire 32 years...the best piece of acquired wisdom I can pass on is never put tea tree oil in your ear. #unrealpain
1272 2018-02-06 21:29:11 I say do what Red Adair decided to do when faced with the problem of putting out oil well fires....
Fight fire with fire.
1273 2018-02-06 21:29:09 Your one mistake was androstene wasn't illegal for McGuire to use at the time it was brought up by a Snoopy reporter. When MLB said it was out on the ban list he stopped using it. Balco owner said he was juicing bonds with stuff inside of the so called flaxseed oil.
1274 2018-02-06 21:29:05 Yes ma’am!  I have a breakdown if I’m out of leave in.  I usually use, olive oil, leave in, curling cream and hair gel
1275 2018-02-06 21:29:00 I would like to try it. Coconut oil is so good for you #dailygoodiebox
1276 2018-02-06 21:29:00 omigosh, yes ! coconut oil is sooooooo good for me !! lol
1277 2018-02-06 21:28:44 Walking and chewing gum: U.S. #shale E&P company Pioneer Natural Resources quadruples semi-annual dividend, and targets 2018 #oil output growth of 19-24% — more on @TheTerminal #OOTT
1278 2018-02-06 21:28:21 Cycles are what you make of them. Accuracy does improve when utilising extra info such as price action, sentiment, moving averages, pivots, support & resistance. But I don’t think cycle counts are entirely predictable. Only found them useful for gold and usually oil..
1279 2018-02-06 21:28:05 So Trump administration changing rules of engagement and allowing military the ability to fight ISIS the way the military felt was best was what? Just Trump taking over oil fields? Because obviously According to you it has nothing to do with trying to save the lives of innocents
1280 2018-02-06 21:27:57 I like the “complimentary” car wash after getting my oil changed.
1281 2018-02-06 21:27:48 Coconut oil has so many uses!! I'd love to try this out.
1282 2018-02-06 21:27:38 Just FYI....No one gives a shit when you’re an adult and you adult correctly. Paid my insurance on time and got my oil changed. Bfd.
1283 2018-02-06 21:27:37 Hoping that any city, state, province that sues big oil immediately has its oil supply stopped.
1284 2018-02-06 21:27:34 excellent rant. In summary, republicans have been in the pocket of the oil industry and banks for decades and are willing to bring down the world to keep enjoying their yachts and mansions. :-p
1285 2018-02-06 21:27:28 After like two weeks I finally remembered to take my fish oil lol
1286 2018-02-06 21:27:24 @Interior @blmnv @NRA @NSSF How do you clean an oil spill? Asking for a friend. #Oregon
1287 2018-02-06 21:27:24 @DineshDSouza . I turn over to you a finely tuned vehicle. The period when you first have it it and it works fine is because I had it tuned up. Then when you fail to maintain it, don't check the oil, drive it like a moron and f*ck it up  - then it's your fault.
1288 2018-02-06 21:27:19 Yesterday a kid tried to vape the essential oil diffuser so it really hasn’t changed
1289 2018-02-06 21:27:17 Same thing you say to yourself when you think that Jamaican castor oil did a miracle on yo face lol
1290 2018-02-06 21:27:15 Working on some oil paintings. I think I got the hang of it by now.
I wonder if I'm ready to become a digital artist
1291 2018-02-06 21:27:01 Using flaxseed oil in place of an oil high in omega 6 is also great for keeping your omega 3 to omega 6 ratio balanced

1294 2018-02-06 21:26:32 Put Rosehip oil girl!!! I had some on my booty when it got bigger and they completely faded and are gone now!
1295 2018-02-06 21:26:30 You could always drip a little essential oil onto cloth and put that cloth in a bag (or roll it up & tie it, etc.) for a DIY sachet. Some people also scent I think rice with the oil & put that in the bag. Or you can just be me and have glamourous cough drops in your tallis bag.

1299 2018-02-06 21:26:09 Obviously we are biased to our flaxseed oil due to its unique, high smoke point.  But any flaxseed oil is great in a smoothie or a salad dressing
1300 2018-02-06 21:26:03 Also re: "Shouldn’t women working behind bars be free of the harassment that this kind of artwork inevitably opens the door for?" Should art gallery workers be concerned about being harassed by men when nude sculptures or oil paintings are displayed? How is that any different?
1301 2018-02-06 21:26:01 Hahahaha sometimes it really feels like that!! Like this month I feel like my hair is so much long than last much. But I’m also not washing it as much and using Marual oil shampoo from Sam’s and I feel like that helps my hair! And also drink so much water will help!
1302 2018-02-06 21:25:35 The @Colts will introduce Josh McDaniels as their new head coach at 4:00 EDT tomorrow at Lucas Oil Stadium.
1303 2018-02-06 21:25:31 Salten I think I spelled that correctly used to have a table top potato chip machine.  There was also a commercial french fry vending machine that will take frozen fries dump them in oil cook them drain them and serve them hot
1304 2018-02-06 21:25:26 today i found out that you can gath bath bombs with cbd oil in them so GUESS WHAT IM BUYINGGGG~
1305 2018-02-06 21:25:14 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.
1306 2018-02-06 21:25:09 Chapped Lip season is in full force, try a lavender lip oil option. If you can find one, chamomile works better. For me at least.
1307 2018-02-06 21:25:07 Coconut oil is essential for my well being
1308 2018-02-06 21:25:05 An ounce of cannabis is 28 grams. 30 is only 2 more than that. I personally buy an ounce of oil once a month or more depending on how much I want to smoke or if there is an event etc coming up. Not including edibles or various strains I want to try etc.
1309 2018-02-06 21:25:05 Josh McDaniels will be introduced as the #Colts head coach Wednesday at 3 p.m. CT at Lucas Oil. @my44news
1310 2018-02-06 21:25:01 Hitz I meant... But it can imply the Oil game too.
1311 2018-02-06 21:24:39 MCT oil is what most people think coconut oil is. (Nope! Most commercially available coconut oil isn't very high in MCTs.)
1312 2018-02-06 21:24:01 If you read the story you'd know they make the cut. The chemical is in the oil. @McDonalds fries are just what you want - potatoes, salt and oil.
1313 2018-02-06 21:24:00 You might be dehydrated, you need products that hydrate and put moisture back into your skin. Oily skin does get dehydrated a lot because we like stripping oil and moisture away to look matte
1314 2018-02-06 21:23:46 Just eight years ago, with the Deepwater Horizon disaster, we saw that oil spills do not respect state boundaries—and that the severe environmental and financial costs last for generations.

A spill anywhere along the East Coast could easily affect our pristine Delaware beaches.
1315 2018-02-06 21:23:41 Coconut oil will work well.
1316 2018-02-06 21:23:35 Erinnert sich noch einer an Oil for Food?
1317 2018-02-06 21:23:33 Interesting.... Cuz I drive through the oil change place, they sell and install wipers. And I never got out of my car....
1318 2018-02-06 21:23:19 Many a slum dwellers would like a loan to start #Pakoda stalls! 
Some will have to make boiled Pakodas until they have made enough profits to buy oil.

Nibert of Eddy County says trust fund needs to be built up so it can "throw off" enough revenue to replace oil&gas revenues that will one day go away. It's now 30-40% of #NM budget.

1323 2018-02-06 21:22:30 Morrocan oil and coconut oil eh? Might have to try
1324 2018-02-06 21:22:24 Coconut oil is a godsend to my burn 
1325 2018-02-06 21:22:23 #Colts introductory press conference for Josh McDaniels will be tomorrow at 4 pm at Lucas Oil Stadium.
1326 2018-02-06 21:22:20 @petreleaf order #11337.  Very disappointed in your packaging.  Bottle leaked during shipping and was an absolute mess to handle.  Edibites are amazing & my pet loves them.  Would order more of them, but will not be buying anymore of the Hemp Oil
1327 2018-02-06 21:22:18 Wow, delayed response! Not defending oil companies, pointing out you cherry picked after the fact. Most companies have not had 9 years of record profits!  8 years of depression era growth, last year booming economy!
1328 2018-02-06 21:21:59 I need to learn how to fix my own car problems and do the simple things as changing a tire and changing my oil filter
1329 2018-02-06 21:21:50 Next time I'm bringing a guy with me to get my oil changed 
1330 2018-02-06 21:21:32 It's a great pre ride oil as well!!!

1334 2018-02-06 21:21:04 The SpaceX Rocket is awesome, but you know the ultimate goal is to help the same a-holes that see oil spills as the price of doing business bring asteroids close to earth for mining purposes right?

1343 2018-02-06 21:19:20 Sprouts from Aldi. Cut off the root, chop in half or dice, drizzle in olive oil, shake of black pepper, stir fry up with onions and other assorted vegetables. Last night: Brussels, zucchini, diced up pork chop, naan, and spicy guacamole as a spread

1345 2018-02-06 21:19:13 There are international laws governing coastal states which gives them the right to own and control resources within 200nm from their baseline. They have the right to their waters nd resources therewith. Let's not complicate matas cos of oil if we truly want true federalism .
1346 2018-02-06 21:19:13 As someone working in nutrition genomics, this is really disappointing. So much opportunity here but this reeks of snake oil.

1348 2018-02-06 21:18:59 Story idea for a dinosaur vampire that feeds off long dead dinosaurs by drinking oil straight from the ground. I will call it... Fracula.

1350 2018-02-06 21:18:58 Coconut oil
1351 2018-02-06 21:18:57 I just use it as a toner, I ditched face wash a long time ago. Only thinking of picking some up because the castor oil I cleanse with can be hard to remove, even with witch hazel.

1354 2018-02-06 21:18:42 Lol ew idk what she’s talking about I use organic coconut oil pretty much for everything and I’m hella moisturized. Use coconut!!!!
1355 2018-02-06 21:18:37 This Registered Dietitian is right on the money about this.  Coconut oil is a fad that does not need to be added to a healthy eating plan due to its high saturate fat content.  Like any high sat fat food, it can have a place in someone's diet, but I agree with this RDN!
1356 2018-02-06 21:18:31 And at one time in the seventies, the third biggest city in Scotland before we were de industrialised and Aberdeen hit oil
1357 2018-02-06 21:18:19 Yep, time for GA to join #TheResistance and shut these money-hungry earth-destroying control freaks out of business. #TheResistanceVOTES How 'bout that green energy that's advancing in other countries? You want coal & oil? Ya gonna bring back the square rock wheel too?

1368 2018-02-06 21:17:07 This is just a taste; most people still think this is snake oil.
1369 2018-02-06 21:16:54 My prediction: oil scarcity will hit the global market and future generations will ask why we rejected the market on our door step.
1370 2018-02-06 21:16:53 Please!  Hugo Chavez socialized everything! Starting with oil! Now his daughter is a billionaire living in Europe! The reason Hollywood loves him so much was because he was a socialist! He constantly had Castro in his presidential palace! Who are you lying to? Yourself?
1371 2018-02-06 21:16:52 There is no legal rule on the U.K. as continuator state holding onto all U.K. debt or the U.K. share of oil or even Scotland’s preference to use sterling. It’s all up for negotiation if separation ever occurred.
1372 2018-02-06 21:16:52 Here you go:
Coat aubergine with oil. Bake on all sides, about 10 minutes. 
Combine the baked aubergine with other delicious veggies, or enjoy on its own, sprinkled, drizzled, or topped.

1379 2018-02-06 21:16:02 Hahaha only 3 years removed, go thru the drive thru and ask for a car load of oil to make up for lost time
1380 2018-02-06 21:16:01 Kung minina na lang kasi ang oil & gas sa Recto Bank napakalaking bagay sana para sa kabuhayan ng ating bansa. Nakaka panghinayang talaga na di pa naipagpapatuloy ang panalong natamo ni PNoy laban sa Tsina para sa ating bansa.
1381 2018-02-06 21:15:59 Check the oil often unless you want 
1382 2018-02-06 21:15:58 I wanted to cook jollof rice but this Gino pepper and Onion something has changed it to Palm oil rice ..
  
1383 2018-02-06 21:15:58 4/5...haven’t come up since the bottom of the recession and oil companies are doing their damndest to keep them down. Making only $25.70/hr when I used to make $32/hr without many if the perks, LOA levels, and freebies. The idea that our industry is dying, particularly now when
1384 2018-02-06 21:15:47 Snake oil salesmen
1385 2018-02-06 21:15:42 Hahah at least you're honest ! BTW I did a marinade of the @FarOutFoodz Groovy Greek and a little olive oil/chicken cutlets, sauteed with a bit of lemon juice.  IT was fantastic ! I can't say enough about it. Leftovers on a nice fresh salad the next day too. 
1386 2018-02-06 21:15:36 LRT i had a very strange perfectly circular stain on my shirt this morning and it was so odd it really felt like it was some ritualistic mark that just APPEARED there lmao it was just from the bottom of an oil bottle i was trying to open tho;;;;;;; I didn't even REALIZE
1387 2018-02-06 21:15:30 We clearly are done with that and onto more important topics.

I use a pre-shave gel/oil and Aveda's shave cream. Foam is generally bad, creates air bubbles against the skin which can lead to nicks and razor burn.
1388 2018-02-06 21:15:12 Oil of Clove, used in moderation. It kills nerve endings.
1389 2018-02-06 21:15:12 Thank you @senatorcantwell for being a champion for our oceans and coasts. Trump’s oil and gas plan threatens the clean, healthy oceans Washington needs.

1392 2018-02-06 21:14:50 You can't figure that out on your own? I lived in a small 12k oil boom town during high oil prices. Local McD's went from 9 an hr  to 11 because other locals were paying more to keep help because of a shortage of employees. Illegals keep wages down.

1399 2018-02-06 21:12:53 Oh yeah, I've had reactions to prescriptions like that, but never CBD oil. Having things with too high CBD can give me a headache, but that's it for me! I'd be surprised if it suddenly caused that much itching, unless you're allergic to the oil that the CBD was broken down in.

1401 2018-02-06 21:12:48 I didn't notice it was a bit chilly till gone 5 & the oil supplier had gone home so I'll have to ring them in the morning. They can generally deliver it quicker if you pay extra & then I'll have to get the plumber round to start the boiler up again.

As you all know SAO is very beneficial for the skin, so it makes sense that it is used a lot in massage therapy. What better way to relax and get soft skin than a massage?

Your gunna be hairy in no time with fries and the oil 
1405 2018-02-06 21:12:30 Other vegetable oils have significantly lower yields. If global palm oil producers switch to these other oils, it will spell the end of the rainforests.

1446 2018-02-06 21:07:56 Trying - because 1. It's particularly difficult to be bad at something you want to do, and continue to put the time into. And 2. You're literally trying. Trying to achieve whatever it is you set your heart to.

Bonus: 3. Extracting oil or fat by heating.

1534 2018-02-06 20:56:22 west buy oil for pennies and put huge taxes and duty and sell it consumers in their own countries
1535 2018-02-06 20:56:20 I'm sat here, feeling sorry for myself, rubbing bio oil on my swole ears, because I'm a dumb idiot and skipped 6mm of stretching
1536 2018-02-06 20:56:19 he blatantly lied about changing our electoral system, he's in bed with big oil, he sells weapons to repressive fascists around the world... he sucks.
1537 2018-02-06 20:56:15 Our room smells like someone was practically rolling around in oil... oh wait I was at work 
1538 2018-02-06 20:55:43 When your mechanic decides to be nice and gives you the oil change for free 
1539 2018-02-06 20:55:37 Surely it’s the oil lamp???

1546 2018-02-06 20:54:38 you could see fake president sweating on tv yesterday when trying to rally supporters. support for this illegitimate president is eroding fast as people see this snake oil salesman for what he really is.
1547 2018-02-06 20:54:10 I saw your query abt moisturizer. I've been experimenting (with some success!) with simple homemade ones using coconut oil as a base, as well as salt scrubs. Have you tried? Worth a shot, or too much hassle?
1548 2018-02-06 20:53:56 a única e melhor coisa do meu dia foi se esbarrar com o oil man
1549 2018-02-06 20:53:41 The state run oil company in Russia. Hermitage tried to buy up controlling shares. The RF filed charges against Browder and threatened trial in absentia. Browder says Kremlin did to sabotage him.

1556 2018-02-06 20:53:08 Soz was too busy reading my oil feature :D
1557 2018-02-06 20:53:02 You are incorrect.  Scotland has its own martime boundary.  Its Scotlands oil.

1559 2018-02-06 20:52:17 Or like when Trump Cancelled the heating program that helps people heat their homes & said the utility companies cannot cut people off in the Dead of winter! But; 1) they’re going to have to pay that off before next winter! 2) not everyone uses electricity for heating (oil, ect)

1568 2018-02-06 20:50:31 Hey #es161 there's an app I found called "sustainable palm oil shopping" that you can use to try to reduce the amount of palm oil you are buying! Palm oil is very destructive for the rainforests of Southeast Asia and are putting a lot of species at risk of extinction 
1569 2018-02-06 20:50:28 Makes complete sense! Page and Sater we’re both in communication with FBI *at the time*.

This plus the Rosneft 10% shares for dropping sanctions so Exxon and Putin could drill $1 Trillion worth of oil so Trump could clear his debt to Russian Mob boss Semion Mogilevic is the plot
1570 2018-02-06 20:50:05 #Assad never used #ChemicalWeapons on ISIS savages who took siege of 90 % of Syrian oil assets but has a weird craving to attack his own civilians with Chemical Weapons in order to invite US bombings on his palace and for ISIS to install caliphate in #Damascus

1571 2018-02-06 20:49:21 Venezuela has highest oil reserves in world,if they were capitalists wouldn't they be drilling for it?
1572 2018-02-06 20:49:09 Still remembering the oil pipeline spill in Burnaby BC - the long-term environmental damage, the amount of money it cost for clean-up, the months long road closure of a main highway.  We don’t want your pipelines in B.C. WE WANT CLEAN ENERGY...

1580 2018-02-06 20:48:09 @DrOz your show on coconut oil today. Why did you not mention the benefits of cannabis infused coconut oil? Even in topical applications, which are NON psychoactive.
1581 2018-02-06 20:47:56 the money alberta pays to ottawa comes from oil and gas, and is then used for the betterment of all of canada. alberta does not sit on it’s gains from oil and not share. this money is important to canadian quality of life.
1582 2018-02-06 20:47:04 It’s taken me just about 10 months to drive 3 thousand miles for my oil change Hahaha
1583 2018-02-06 20:47:03 *stares out the window* how do i tiptoe the line of being a slob but not getting fired--

1589 2018-02-06 20:45:48 It's the worst winter here since I arrived in 2004. I'm so glad I work from home (and have enough heating oil, for now) #sbswinnershour

1594 2018-02-06 20:45:23 Shit. This was deep. He said ManCity was born in 2009.   small club enjoying oil Money this season. 
1595 2018-02-06 20:45:16 Taking care of the whip before heading downtown. Wash & oil change. Girl needed some pampering after I’ve neglected her.
1596 2018-02-06 20:45:13 A poor product, badly marketed, doesn't breed loyalty. Still, no reason to turn to snake oil.
1597 2018-02-06 20:45:12 He cares about that middle class! He’s a joke. Oil oil oil!
1598 2018-02-06 20:45:09 Thats messed up, it shouldn't have happened. And yes hierarchies can develop in leftist spaces based on perceived intellectual authority and other problematic things. Some of us do try and be conscious of this.
1599 2018-02-06 20:45:06 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1600 2018-02-06 20:45:02 They will try to give you tramadol  is it muscle or bone if it’s bone take COD liver oil tabs they help 
1601 2018-02-06 20:44:54 Got oil and new wiper blades for my car. I think that fulfills my adult duties for the week.
1602 2018-02-06 20:44:50 Who uses oil diffusers?
1603 2018-02-06 20:44:45 As Oil goes up it takes away dollars for milk purchase in the home?
1604 2018-02-06 20:44:39 VA passed a "Let Doctors Decide" law on medical marijuana. However, it still applies mainly to oil forms. Specifically to CBD and THC-A. VA also shot down a decriminalization bill 3 days ago.
1605 2018-02-06 20:44:37 Don’t think Joe collabs with cooking oil. He does with Oli though, love a good #Joli collab.
1606 2018-02-06 20:44:24 Sure, strong oil prices help demand but the MENA region market share has been lackluster throughout the rise in oil. Its all about tight butterfat and NZ weather right now
1607 2018-02-06 20:44:16 And what, specifically, economy do you want to switch to? What multi-billion dollar industry is going to magically appear to replace the resource sector?

Oil demand around the world is increasing. Would you rather see those benefits accrue here, or other places in the world?
1608 2018-02-06 20:44:15 True. My point is:

We can both love and be critical at the same time. 

Economically, long term, how is the wealth spread throughout the country from oil and natural resource revenue? 

Why are European markets domineering over the continent's currencies? 

That needs to fix.
1609 2018-02-06 20:44:07 also i used straight up vitamin e oil from a capsule as moisturizer last night bc recent horribly frigid weather has sucked all of the moisture out of my skin & left it gross & flaky..... & I woke up w it virtually resolved
1610 2018-02-06 20:44:06 @StaceyDooley Hi Stacey looking for one of your episodes where you followed a man that made cannabis  oil for people with cancer, Would like to get in contact with him if possible. Cheers
1611 2018-02-06 20:43:52 (Laughing softly she turns to reach for the box of goodies) You can. Be careful of the brownies. They have cannabis oil in them.
1612 2018-02-06 20:43:40 Fancy that! Hot oil creates smoke? Opening a door gets rid of it? Magic.
1613 2018-02-06 20:43:19 I still cannot believe I cut my hair like this, it’ll be wigs and wild growth oil allll 2018 well at least until it grows back lol

1617 2018-02-06 20:42:35 Ran out of heating oil. Delivery attempted today but wasn’t sure if right property and called when I was in a meeting. Hope they’ve not delivered to wrong house as it’s not in our tank.
1618 2018-02-06 20:42:27 Cooking can be easy and fun and also you can scald a bunch of your arm on boiling hot oil like I just did.
1619 2018-02-06 20:42:26 Ya! I plan to put out some videos in the future that encompass alternative medicine including essential oil use. 
1620 2018-02-06 20:42:18 Investors don’t fall for the billionaire’s traps. The market is still overvalued. This dip is nothing it needs to go down another 4,000 minimum to be valued correctly. Oil should never even be above $30 a barrel. Stop the madness Let’s see what Powell can do. #StockMarket

1625 2018-02-06 20:41:32 I wish it was like 1750 and I was a white man and people wanted to fund me so I could do nothing but create art. It’s really hard to convince people nowadays to buy new oil paints for me- a really good painter who is also not very productive and incredibly self-doubting
1626 2018-02-06 20:41:16 Arabs would have been better off with Turks instead of being colonised and selling oil for free
1627 2018-02-06 20:41:13 I remember i went to go get a oil change and the dude came back in and said my transmission need to be flushed. Like what bro I aint never heard of that one lmaooo

I’ve drifted it and redlined it every single day for the past 12,000 miles. No issues at all. Diff’s May go but not common. Engines are solid just early ones have oil pump issue (pre12-62 cars)
1678 2018-02-06 20:35:19 But what if only less oil is used? Woh bhi olive oil.

1686 2018-02-06 20:34:39 look lush bath bombs ARE tight as hell but the bath melts are BEtter because they pack more Oil and therefore mean u can avoid conditioning your hair or moisturizing after u shower
1687 2018-02-06 20:34:23 Strategically eating healthy high calorie snacks and meals, peanut butter, almonds/walnuts, adding more olive oil to everything, lots of protein, drinking my calories in smoothies and shakes, keeping track of it all. pretty much it, still very rough needs more detail

1706 2018-02-06 20:31:22 So why were the journalists that tried to implicate Erdogan's family imprisoned then ? God only knows how many they imprisoned and killed in Turkey to silence and quash the proof, but the world is not stupid. Erdogan couldn't have not known about thousands of oil trucks daily.
1707 2018-02-06 20:31:16 i hate to sound generic but tea tree oil really is your best friend
1708 2018-02-06 20:31:01 If oil would just fall straight to $60 now, that'b great.
1709 2018-02-06 20:30:57 Drillholes and data from mining/oil & gas I would imagine will have wider appeal than caves and more likely to fund development!
1710 2018-02-06 20:30:57 Let a righteous man strike me—it is a kindness; let him rebuke me—it is  oil for my head; let my head not refuse it. Yet my prayer is continually  against their evil deeds.

1722 2018-02-06 20:29:24 This is how awkward I am... I always have the hardest time opening my hood from the inside... that the oil technician had to do it and it was a woman. I’m an embarrassment to myself... and society. #GodHelpMe

Holla at me...I know a few ventures in New Orleans and Port Arthur that can make you richer. Plus I know the oil game!
1728 2018-02-06 20:29:00 I saw this on a friend's wall and just had to share.  Very profound!

The next time your oil light comes on in your  car, just hide the light. Cover it up. Keep hiding it until one day your car just dies. That's absurd, right?

So why do we do this when a warning sig…

1733 2018-02-06 20:28:26 I'm referring to the larger intricate oil paintings that typically have several layers. Those usually fail to fully dry because the oil and water separate at some point. So while they do mostly dry, there's still a possibility of damage.

1754 2018-02-06 20:25:45 Why are you ignoring facts ? Do you think that Erdogan was looking the other way and didn't notice when thousands of oil trucks were going into Turkey daily ? Why have journalists who presented proof of his family involvement been imprisoned ? Use your brain and think
1755 2018-02-06 20:25:38 One pretty unique feature of this brutal equity sell-off - the carnage had almost no collateral damage in any other asset class - bond yields dropped marginally, the dollar mildly flexed upwards, gold and oil blinked a wee bit, while equity markets the world over collapsed

1765 2018-02-06 20:24:01 Ah yes, the 25 litre palm oil containers imported from Indonesia! Absolutely everywhere and unique to Ethiopia - not in Kenya or Uganda I think!

1779 2018-02-06 20:22:21 The first time I heard that somebody compares oil (a legal product to trade) with drugs (which has been illegal and the discussion is if you should legalize or not to decriminalize the trade). Maybe next time compare with toys or bikes.

1793 2018-02-06 20:20:28 USA exporting inflation was only possible after Bretton Woods & b4 Nixon closed gold window.

1807 2018-02-06 20:18:32 I think I got it man. Whew. It looked like the oil pan plug and a few bolts holding up the pan were leaking. Engine cooled off, and I tightened some hard to get to bolts. Been idling for 15 minutes. No leaks! 
1808 2018-02-06 20:18:22 True. However there aren't many non oil cars and we want to encourage them. Would stop idiots talking about cyclists paying road tax. Hard to argue against losing a tax too.

3. Interest rate hike? No: new Fed chair too reluctant to do it

1828 2018-02-06 20:15:24 So your argument is: small now means small tomorrow?

You understand that statement implies that no new technology can ever break through?

1833 2018-02-06 20:14:32 betting on a drop in oil has been a struggle since the Bayes days.  I'm probably break even since then, so cant complain.  However, DRIP has been a champ.  Interesting that betting against the producers has worked so much better than the commodity itself.

1859 2018-02-06 20:11:40 I'm 40 now, so I have less than half the hair I used to have, and it's not coarse anymore.  When I use oil, I have to use the tiniest bit, and it tends to weigh down my ends. I do it in winter most of the time, but not any other time of year. That's on top of using a frizz creme
1860 2018-02-06 20:11:26 Like bullying trying to cause oil spills now.

Breathe, and the interest towards me ends

1946 2018-02-06 20:01:01 True but... your man @jimcarr_wpg  appears to be only bothered by the pipeline to BC b/c it creates jobs, gets oil to market. He showed no such urgency about Energy East.  #nbpoli

"Fine, I won't destroy them."

He cancels out the lightning, and grumbles.

"Oil... Fucking oil."

"What's your plan then? Talk to them? Give them kind words?"

1963 2018-02-06 19:59:29 Thanks for reaching out. The logo on the oil can is from 1963 –1984.  ZC was started in 1963, but it was 2 or 3 years before anyone really started using them.  Best guess based on that would be 1963 - 1965
1964 2018-02-06 19:59:13 I mean with the right kind of oil, it could be a delight.  Lucky guy, I assume it wasn’t bacon grease.

1982 2018-02-06 19:57:26 We called it 'thick leaf thyme' in  It is very common. Do you know if you pound the leaves with some oil and salt, microwave it and put it on bruising and injuries, it heals it? It's part of the oregano family.

1999 2018-02-06 19:55:10 Well, I made it and it's really scrumptious but, I memorised the amounts got totally confused with cups and made it a bit wet. Oh, and reading it through again I might have missed out the oil and swapped honey for sugar. Might have added some fresh Basil too.

2012 2018-02-06 19:53:55 Snake oil salesman tend to do that to their customers.  The trick is to avoid falling for the con in the first place, like the 65 million other people who didn’t vote for Trump

2057 2018-02-06 19:48:29 Party correct. Wind/solar doesn’t work on its own but must partner with dispatchable power. If possible with hydr/nuclear, fine, still low emissions. If with gas, coal, or oil very high emissions.

2077 2018-02-06 19:46:22 Break even = no exploration.

So with all your hot air, what's your problem with NAFTA?

You don't seem to have much of a point, and happy to take any deal shoved on table no matter how detrimental to Canada.

Sell out the Canadian dairy industry and oil/gas to what benefit?
2078 2018-02-06 19:46:20 fun #skincare tip i learned yesterday: olive oil makes your skin SUPER soft
2079 2018-02-06 19:46:09 Oh really? I haven’t heard anything bad about it. For me, it’s a good natural product that keeps both my hair and skin soft. If my hair is feeling dry, I just put some coconut oil and it goes back to being soft and moisturized again
2080 2018-02-06 19:46:07 Smoking oil cartiges are for pussys who can’t handle dabs
2081 2018-02-06 19:46:04 It's said that one shouldn't cry over spilled milk but can I cry over spilled coconut oil cuz that stuff is precious

2086 2018-02-06 19:45:28 Unfortunately I think its unrealistic to hope for oil sand extraction to stop, we can only hope for a decrease, it will only truly stop when there's nothing left to extract! #lesson5
2087 2018-02-06 19:45:27 bleh i didnt have any olive oil so my couscous is super dry

2098 2018-02-06 19:43:37 That was the exact response the Parti Quebecois had when they shut down oil reserves down in the Hudson Bay and gave a big FU to feds. She had a majority gov... next term rolled by and she didn’t get one seat.

2101 2018-02-06 19:43:16 Walmart is a crazy place,  like I’ll go in there for oil and leave with clothes, ammo, a new view on life, and aids.   Magical place
2102 2018-02-06 19:43:16 Do not put butter or oil on the burns as it may trap heat &amp; cause burns to worsen. Instead hold the burnt area under cold running water.
2103 2018-02-06 19:43:16 petrol was around 85 when crude oil price was $120 per barrel and with almost same taxes but now it's around 80 when crude oil price is $50 per barrel. at that time same people were blaming govt for this but now defending it

2106 2018-02-06 19:42:48 I don’t blame the public who voted Brexit. My sadness and anger is directed to all those politicians and newspaper editors who knowingly are selling this snake oil of a post brexit nirvana
2107 2018-02-06 19:42:47 ...spoken like a true snake oil salesman / grifter...
2108 2018-02-06 19:42:42 Considering the abrupt crash of that FPV Raptor into a large oil tank, I hope that it is not a portent for what's to come...

2112 2018-02-06 19:42:28 Terry said I actually require synthetic oil so they weren’t lying
2113 2018-02-06 19:42:20 Only the foundation. But it's good, keeps my oil at bay, but they don't have my color. I'd have to mix and that's too much money. I'm sure they'll add a few more colors eventually! Great product tho, I'm sure I could get the light shade and use it as a mixer. 
2114 2018-02-06 19:42:17 not like that. goldman must short oil now. what they say to press must be fake.
2115 2018-02-06 19:42:14 What if they tie our currency to oil? Has been tied to gold & silver...

2120 2018-02-06 19:41:31 Other than oil, the size of the economies of the Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar were negligible up until  20 years ago. Even had really sketchy power grids. No agriculture, manufacturan, tourism or international shopping. Even the education was horrific. They have diversified.

2133 2018-02-06 19:40:27 So do you mean to say that @narendramodi is Manmohansingh? I beg to differ, Mr.Singh was an economist who kept Indian economy afloat during global economic crisis. @narendramodi failed to even maintain the 2014 levels when global economy was recovering & oil was cheapest.

2146 2018-02-06 19:39:03 Ah yes, the big #AHA  coconut oil scare. Upon hearing this I went out and bought more.
2147 2018-02-06 19:39:00 One more year at 3M to see it doesn’t seem like much. Let Strome walk.

2151 2018-02-06 19:38:45 depending how bad it is, you can use some 1% hydrocortisone too.. when i first moved to vegas my skin didn’t agree with the weather conditions so i rotated with the coconut oil and hydrocortisone 
2152 2018-02-06 19:38:18 They are different ! The orange ones have orange oil in !
2153 2018-02-06 19:38:13 Bought some cookies that list "sustainable palm oil" as an ingredient and I feel like I'm on some gwenyth paltrow shit.
2154 2018-02-06 19:37:49 and all you care about is oil & money. Fracking causes more Oklahoma earthquakes. The environment matters!!!!! @SierraClub ROCKS. How about some green energy? Oh, yeah, -45 taxed incoming solar panels to promote land/animal destruction for $$$$, oil & oligarchs.
2155 2018-02-06 19:37:42 I tried everything but I did recently pick up the blotting paper and I was really impressed it took all the oil but barely any product
2156 2018-02-06 19:37:37 They will tell you it’s doing so well with healthcare and tech.  The only reason this city bounced back financially is because of oil and gas.  But our dem mayor claims it’s all because of him.  As far as immigrants,!i don’t know.  But our homeless population have erupted.
2157 2018-02-06 19:37:27 Love O-3. References?  Med/Pharma currently beating up O-3 supplements as worthless when issue is always quality and dose of EPA/DHA. There are 2 Rx Fish Oil equivalents, Lovaza and Omacor. Why is O-3 then worthless? Very clever manipulation going on.

2164 2018-02-06 19:36:07 When you elect a snake oil salesman you shouldn't be surprised when he really didn't care about the problems he promised to solve.

2175 2018-02-06 19:34:32 You know what would get all my money? A Whole Foods / New Seasons natural food store, but without the giant supplement section. I don't like buying from companies that also peddle snake oil.
2176 2018-02-06 19:34:29 rub some 100% extra virgin coconut oil on that, should help the flares
2177 2018-02-06 19:34:28 Hahahahaha I went to buy a bottle of oil and I couldn’t open the thing for my motor I was suffering and this guy came out of nowhere and just opened it :( he was like I saw you struggling I work in autozone so just tell them next time to put it in for you 
2178 2018-02-06 19:34:22 When your economy depends so much on energy, like the EUA, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, etc, you can transform much faster your economy to the only 2 other sectors they can compete (services/renew). For Mexico manufacture is very important; oil is quite low nowadays.
2179 2018-02-06 19:34:05 Damn do men this days take his woman car to get wash, oil change, etc without you asking
2180 2018-02-06 19:34:00 Israel is Stealing gas oil and even water from Golan which is illegal Mark . It’s Syrians land & it’s illegal to annex it . But they are distracted by the proxies war . They can’t stop it . USA companies have the contracts . These are facts .

2206 2018-02-06 19:30:14 Exactly! Now they're creating asset bubbles with unfair redistribution of wealth, but low end wages have to rise & interest rates have to rise, too. And Trump's energy policies push oil prices to rise. All of that = inflation. Some analysts now predict stagflation due to Trump

2219 2018-02-06 19:29:00 I can't prove this definitively but I'm 99.9% certain the guys at One Stop Oil Change in Orleans refused to give my car an oil change because there's an anti-Trump sticker on the back.

2221 2018-02-06 19:28:38 It is so much more an econo-political tactic guised as environmentalism.  If it weren't, the US, China, and (insert oil producing country here) would have been snubbed as well.  

So disappointed in the liberal and NDP leaders blinded by lies.  Can't they smell the stench?

2334 2018-02-06 19:15:39 So amazing. Plus basically use a tiny bit Shea Butter or Argan oil on my face most of the time after washing my face and those oils double for hair too. We had knowledge before all these unnecessarily complex chemical concoctions...
2335 2018-02-06 19:15:25 I mix all my oils in my deep conditioner and I try to oil my scalp and hair every other night.
2336 2018-02-06 19:15:03 one time, my chemistry teacher said fats that are solid at room temp are healthier than liquid fats, and so i asked her if that meant butter was healthier than olive oil, and she screamed at me. good times

2341 2018-02-06 19:14:33 BP & Shell are listed on the UK stock market and pay corporation tax on their profits. This allows WM to make it appear there is no money being made on oil & gas fields, whilst the UK parent company makes all the profits that WM can then tax. Norway taxes the resources not profit

2343 2018-02-06 19:14:26 OPEC will soon become irrelevant. Oil is no longer the goldmine. Think about this

Bad #Leadership costs a lot
2345 2018-02-06 19:14:09 But you don't prioritize the "greatest threats" you protest the easiest threats and that is the issue. If you cared about the greatest threats you would do the risk analysis and start fighting against oil-by-rail but that simply doesn't generate the donations
2346 2018-02-06 19:13:25 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
2347 2018-02-06 19:13:21 @realDonaldTrump 
Please think of us citizens that have been ripped off from govmt misuse of SS money
And please crackdown on oil companies that are ripping us off.
You lowered their tax and they raised cost. Please apply a penalty for that
2348 2018-02-06 19:13:19 I always found the 'for the Oil' line of reasoning pretty suspect, at least in relation to Bush era and after actions. 70s embargo more clear, Even Op Ajax muddy w domino thry. FR and Dutch oil interest/policy in NA/MENA more clear. Will check out this paper.

Re Accutane: Some people take it once a week just to keep oil production down. I'm thinking about asking my doc for that.

2377 2018-02-06 19:09:49 A country WE invaded and bombed after their surrender under H.W. and again invaded under the guise of a war on terror for purposes of getting oil that in actuality had NO connection to Al Qaeda, thus destabilizing the region even further. Yeah they did SO much to us.

2390 2018-02-06 19:08:55 The next time your oil light comes on in your car, just hide the light. Hide it until your car dies. That's absurd, right? 

So why do we ignore

You’ll need it longer than your car! $40/month is what we’re talking about!

2392 2018-02-06 19:08:49 Why when we have such an over abundance of oil that they are exporting it are gas prices so high? I suggest we start boycotting certain gas stations for a week. If gas doesn't go down, put them out of business.
2393 2018-02-06 19:08:47 please give aloth a more balanced diet than oil he needs to eat :(
2394 2018-02-06 19:08:41 I'm not sure why, but every time I order oil from Amazon, they pack it worse than anything else I order. Almost like they want it to leak
2395 2018-02-06 19:08:30 Since you guys produce oil though, could there be less of an interest by the powers that be?

2400 2018-02-06 19:07:54 Maybe @MikeHudema can explain why he ignores all non-Canadian oil tankers on the West Coast...

2405 2018-02-06 19:07:31 get the damn pipelines built so we can export to countries other than the US who we are forced to "give away" our oil to because they know we have ZERO other customers! My God are we ever stupid!
2406 2018-02-06 19:07:23 Bahasa Indonesia much closer sounding to my native languages, I’m afraid. Even as I know that ancestral Filipinos ARE Malay. (Am not liking Indonesians right now because of their palm oil crap and genocidal oppression of Timorese minorities.)

2410 2018-02-06 19:07:02 I woke up in a bomb ass mood today. I drank my water. Took my vitamins. Put rosehip oil all over myself. I'm ready to conquer the world. Sending positive vibes your way

2415 2018-02-06 19:06:34 Just a "pawn"? The blame must certainly be shared between supply (Saudi Arabia, etc) and demand (US, Europe, etc), but you can´t blame only the 2nd. Otherwise all the blame would rest on households/factories (demand at national level) and not at all on the big oil firms (supply).
2416 2018-02-06 19:06:25 Day 5 of a lazy staycation. Self maintenance and computer games- treating my beat up hiker feet with argan oil and winter-dry skin with shea butter. Looks weird in the moment but feels SO GOOD.

2428 2018-02-06 19:05:14 Oh, and the irony is she WASHED the can and put that in the recycling. But put the oil in the garbage. And scooped off whatever leftover fish bits there were into the sink and didn't rinse. Nasty woman.

2442 2018-02-06 19:03:33 It appears that both the government of Alberta & the USW have little understanding of why government exists and on whose authority it works. The people of B.C. want nothing to do with the fossil fuel industry. Your oil isn't important - our coast, our environment & our future are
2443 2018-02-06 19:03:32 So if we would rather pay the US a premium for refining our own product. Or support oil from other totalitarian regimes, we need to support our own economy long enough to develop the alternatives.

2483 2018-02-06 18:59:40 As stated, Aug 1, 2016. 30k service & all they did was an oil change. Just confirmed w/ my mechanic (filthy air filter, both remotes needed new batteries, etc) It’s a Hybrid, so rarely needs service.
2484 2018-02-06 18:59:33 Tea tree oil smells so good I want to stick it up my nose
2485 2018-02-06 18:59:19 It’s clearly Canada’s oil when we want to get it “to  market” and the risk BC coastline.When we suggest a NEP and fair, Canada wide gas prices suddenly the ownership of “our”oil becomes less clear.
2486 2018-02-06 18:59:07 Lol no...oil tanks
2487 2018-02-06 18:59:04 Students at school were asked to write about the harmful effects of oil on fish. 
 
One 11-year old wrote, "When my mom opened a tin of sardines last night it was full of oil and all the sardines were dead."

2490 2018-02-06 18:58:49 A scene in Outlander that didn't make it into the series involves Claire getting a wax job at a highborn friend's house & Jamie being scandalized. & then he turned out to be allergic to the hyacinth oil after shave so she had to wash it off.
2491 2018-02-06 18:58:37 After getting his engine checked, my husband has to drink a cleansing liquid for a few days straight because of the side products that his oil left in him. He clearly needs better "food" but... The Farm can't afford it.
2492 2018-02-06 18:58:26 can someone go w me to get an oil change? i don’t want to go alone
2493 2018-02-06 18:58:22 I heard bio oil works really good
2494 2018-02-06 18:58:21 A11: I'm excited to try the super greens and the butter flavored coconut oil! #StrongerYou
2495 2018-02-06 18:58:14 The one oil they don't believe in: deodorant

2501 2018-02-06 18:57:46 Merchants of death and destruction. I still cannot fathom how this snake oil "profession" manages to dupe people into believing that what they sell is "medicine;" and that it is based on biological medical science. How?  Pfft.

2504 2018-02-06 18:57:38 Commandeer some oil sands haul trucks. Should fill the gap for the time being.

2510 2018-02-06 18:56:50 Love an Epsom salt bath with lavender oil, a cup of cocoa and singing bowls, chimes, or some binaural beats. To appeal to each sense of the body is the greatest tool for my self-regulation. Edibles are the silver bullet. *hugs*

2515 2018-02-06 18:56:18 I don't use a recipe per se but if you look at any of the online recipes you'll get a good idea of what to do. Baked or fried, types of frying oil, spices - it's all out there!  Just find a recipe that suits your style - and it's worth the effort.  Make some and give us a report!
2516 2018-02-06 18:56:14 Salad with halloumi, olives, grapes, crispy onions and a random dressing of balsamic, thick soy sauce and a wee bit of oil. Not bad.
2517 2018-02-06 18:55:52 What’s unsustainable about dairy? Soy oil is used as a table oil across the globe. Without animal consumption of soya, there would still be a demand for the current acreage. The soya area grown wouldn’t change.
2518 2018-02-06 18:55:52 Makes perfect GC every time. If you are looking to spice things up a bit you can try canola oil for grilling and some honey mustard to dip.

2529 2018-02-06 18:54:55 She doesn’t know how to change her oil?
2530 2018-02-06 18:54:53 Well if you really wanna know, Ive learned recently that washing with plain water and moisturizing with organic coconut oil is the best option and a girls body naturally fights odors without the help of anything else
2531 2018-02-06 18:54:51 Do you guys change oil and rotate tires too while waiting? #BusinessOpportunity
2532 2018-02-06 18:54:34 Lavander oil is going to be my best friend today

2547 2018-02-06 18:52:35 why would anything beside oil and salt be in my fries

2557 2018-02-06 18:51:00 I usually go for sardines(in water or olive oil). Readily available and cheap.

Fine then.
Send SNP numpties out to extract it then.
You want to be like Norway, why don't you go and live there, see how much you get taxed? Pay for healthcare, pay more for food and essentials, see how you get on.
They've been dipping into the oil fund.

2568 2018-02-06 18:49:50 Do not agree. To be fair, Saudi Arabia was a pawn in the oil extraction business. How much oil are they actually guilty of consuming and expelling into the atmosphere? They leveraged oil-thirsty countries when able, oil thirsty countries like US way more guilty for CO2 emissions
2569 2018-02-06 18:49:43 Mostly because nothing has been recovered. The only oil slick I know of was reported a month later. Could have been related to the sub, but was a long way north. #ARASanJuan

2597 2018-02-06 18:44:18 I notice the "All other goods" segment is rather stable. So can one infer that the economy isn't actually diversifying and the total increase is actually because the price of oil has slowly crept up a few dollars?

2623 2018-02-06 18:40:00 PURE TeaTree tincture/essential oil is BEST anti fungal known to humankind.
We would consider checking for a YEAST bloom: Candida.
We'd consider the need to restore proper Ph Balance; Candida THRIVES in an alkaline environment; e.g., right after antibiotic therapy.
Worth asking.

2634 2018-02-06 18:39:08 It is unfortunate to see that some energy commentators would support illegal political deals in KRI to serve short term interest that remain dangerous for the stability of #Iraq.

All oil exports should be handled by the Federal Govt, while all be obliged to adhere to Budget Law.
2635 2018-02-06 18:38:45 I can’t wait to get my car back so I can reactivate my onstar and Sirius Xm, Fill my tank up, get a new oil change and get that hoe detailed in and out

2637 2018-02-06 18:38:36 Then refrigerate. Best done overnight but really important they’re stone cold before roasting. Really hot oven, 200c. Dripping is best but oil works. Remove to baste but keep over flame so fat doesn’t cool. About 20 mins but varies if full oven. Delicious!
2638 2018-02-06 18:38:33 I am so fucking sleepy but i am waiting for light to come so i can microwave my hair oil ugh
2639 2018-02-06 18:38:17 Have you tried coconut oil for head lice? I wonder if it would work the same as conditioner and suffocate the lice if you put enough on and leave it for a bit and then comb through. I haven’t tried it but would interested to hear if anyone else has.
2640 2018-02-06 18:38:16 I agree...I use peppermint oil as a mouse repellent & a sleepy time oil at bedtime for relaxation. Do either work...the verdict is still out...but they smell good 
2641 2018-02-06 18:38:13 I came to jiffy lube to get an oil change and the person servicing my car was a female. She had on a dark lip and false lashes. I was like yasss sis. I gave her some makeup I had in my trunk. She was happy. 
2642 2018-02-06 18:38:08 Friday & Monday equaled a 7.5% drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Review and watch oil and natural gas prices for the past month. These will signal the Futures market direction (Bitcoin too). 15% “correction” highly possible. It’s all correlated. Don’t be fooled. Do puts!
2643 2018-02-06 18:38:05 It also helps to level the playing field so sustainable energy can become competitive. And hey, what about all of those Oil & Gas subsidies?

2656 2018-02-06 18:35:43 Help me here. They are destroying the planet?  By extracting oil?  Oil is the thing you say is so valuable that it can pay Scotland’s bills for ever. But it is only worth something if you get it out of the ground, which requires you to “destroy the planet”. Make your mind up.
2657 2018-02-06 18:35:40 it took the US 20yrs from 1950 to move oil production from 5m to 10m barrels a day- it took only 8 years to do the same in shale revolution.- a silicon valley like compression of time to scale @OGJOnline @clareo
2658 2018-02-06 18:35:29 Telling, isn't it, that the oil producing provinces should lead the charge on "reasoned environmental development" and pick a fight with those opposing them, rather than try to understand and find a good solution. A town hall in Nanaimo isn't enough to fix this.

2756 2018-02-06 18:20:50 Our society is long overdue for an overhaul in technological advances (especially transportation, thank you @elonmusk and @Tesla for making that a reality), but that wont stop big businesses like oil from trying to squash innovation.
2757 2018-02-06 18:20:39 it shrinks even more when you consider often when women have that benchmark there's an educational requirement as well to be "equally yolked". They don't want an engineer at an oil refinery 100k, they want a "thinker" 100k.

2765 2018-02-06 18:20:06 We cannot afford another Exxon Valdez, or a Deepwater Horizon spill!! The risk of a major oil spill is too great, and the small everyday spills are just an expected outcome. Tourism, fishing industries, and marine life, all depend on a healthy, clean ocean!! #NotOffOurCoast

2767 2018-02-06 18:19:53 Previous administrations chose war as a solution to our need for oil. @POTUS has chosen an alternative method that would serve to stimulate the economy and avoid the need for foreign oil, and allow us time to implement alternative sustainable fuels.
2768 2018-02-06 18:19:49 Capitalism demands the rape of the Earth and the theft of its oil.
2769 2018-02-06 18:19:48 We want our land back. If Africa unite and speak with one voice, the sanctions and trade boycott won't last or work. If we reclaim the land, the gold, oil, diamond and all precious minerals will be ours again. We will be a mighty race once more @Julius_S_Malema
2770 2018-02-06 18:19:47 This might sound weird but I would date coconut oil if I could.
2771 2018-02-06 18:19:44 I'm actually more annoyed that Trudeau took the time to correct someone's lack of political correctness purity while justifying to them the building of oil pipelines through indigenous land. That's peak neoliberal.

According to a prediction from a Jr high teacher I had, the world ran out of oil 10 years ago, and all our reserves ran out 8 years ago.

2789 2018-02-06 18:17:11 Try it and see. You can also use any other carrier oil instead of coconut oil, or no oil at all if that’s still too oily for your skin.

2801 2018-02-06 18:15:56 Well, I begin by heating up the oil over medium heat - I add garlic for a hint of zestiness and gas to my life. I then sauté asparagus cut into three sections, and then adding a handful of spinach. I let it simmer down into a mess of green. And then pour over three shuffled eggs.
2802 2018-02-06 18:15:43 No it doesn’t. I find that the witch hazel balances the coconut oil & my sunscreen is light. 
But then again I have combination skin & I’m the same girl who can also just use “vaseline”/ baby oil & sunscreen on my face

2902 2018-02-06 18:02:18 Things change fast . After low method of shale oils discovered in USA ,oil price plummet. Also world is moving towards electric cars. India was reduced to nothing after spice was discovered in Africa. Nothing last for ever
2903 2018-02-06 18:02:13 The dealership stay trying to get money off a bitch. I came for a tire rotation , wheel alignment , wheel balance and oil change. Not nothing else.
2904 2018-02-06 18:02:07 What do you guys use to keep your face oil free? My skin is very oily and yet looks and feels dry when i use normal to oily skin products.  I honestly don't know what else to use, i come back home with my face shinny everyday  Please help #GirlTalkZa
2905 2018-02-06 18:02:04 Also I saved the trunks I wore that year and they are still stained from oil
2906 2018-02-06 18:02:02 can anyone do an oil change for the low?

2919 2018-02-06 18:01:12 I fried them up in butter cause we were out of olive oil...so some got a bit crispy nom nom
2920 2018-02-06 18:01:02 We understand enough to act.
What I truly can't understand is why you think there isn't tremendous money behind denial. Big Oil dominates the largest companies by revenue list, & climate change is an existential threat. OBVIOUSLY they put big money in denial!!!
2921 2018-02-06 18:00:58 Stop with the partisan divide people!  Realize that the #DeepState is bipartisan!! That's why no matter who we elect, foreign policy never really changes! If you follow the trail, it's still about oil!

2925 2018-02-06 18:00:36 Exactly. Alberta has a right to BCs coast and BC has a right to Alberta’s oil at $15/barrel. Right? Oh wait.., your oil, you get to set price. So Provinces have rights to their resources and land to do as they wish

Hence the 50/50 odds: he didn't know it'd work cause he had never done that before.

And lo and behold...

It fucking worked.

I feel a bit special tbh.

2936 2018-02-06 17:59:19 we’ve started giving my boyfriends grandma CBD oil to help her and lately shes been laughing more and been more relaxed than she has been. i dont get why some ppl turn away from medical use of hemp just bc it’s marijuana?? it’s beneficial in so many ways
2937 2018-02-06 17:59:02 that’s cause it’s probably getting dry. his hair needs regular care just like older kids. shea moisture has a good kids line or if you worried about that being too harsh for him rn you can use water, coconut oil, and natural shea butter to keep it moisturized
2938 2018-02-06 17:59:01 *reminds self she needs to season cast iron for sibling like she promised* What type of oil you using? We did flaxseed until we found out it flakes like crazy and then had to reseason everything...
2939 2018-02-06 17:58:45 Indeed it was. Whilst they could have a go now and then (especially labour) all was fine with their world. And all the while they wasted our oil boom money.

2943 2018-02-06 17:58:27 i wonder if maybe using an oil after cleansing instead might be different? i have an oil cleanser, but i only use it in my morning shower if i didn't take my makeup off the night before.  i don't really like how it feels for me though.  i feel like it didn't actually cleanse.
2944 2018-02-06 17:58:26 :). I was invited to an event and I was wondering why there were so many rich folks there.

2952 2018-02-06 17:57:14 Garbage, doom-fantasy reporting, I'm afraid.

Condensate will evaporate and doesn't significantly dissolve. The bunker fuel oil will produce a small oil spill with environmental effects. The cargo won't.
2953 2018-02-06 17:57:01 Pretty much and who wouldn't be. I saw a meme that said he was training ISIS fighters on his 1 billion dollar government yacht built using foreign oil with Carmen Electra and Gary Busey.

2973 2018-02-06 17:53:37 When I had a house, it ran out of heating oil once. That was fun. They refilled it while I was at work but the pilot light went out when then tank emptied, so I came home to a 51 degree house.

3004 2018-02-06 17:51:19 i HIGHLY recommend introducing face oil.  i use one by Julep & i LOVE it.  i have combination/oily skin, so a face oil seemed counter-intuitive, but it's done wonders for balancing my skin.  rosehip seed oil is good for sensitive skin (anti-inflammatory), so that may also help.
3005 2018-02-06 17:51:17 Even then, they use palm oil

3011 2018-02-06 17:50:16 Honestly it’s usually cheaper to pay someone to do it if you getting normal oil.     I’ve gotta run full synthetic in the gti so instead of paying someone $100 it cost like $40 to do it myself.

3014 2018-02-06 17:49:45 I think what buddy was saying was. The price of designer belts cost 500+ some are less an some are more. So if you can afford to have 5 500 dollar belts thats 2500. With 2500 you can afford to take a trip somewhere out the u.s.

3039 2018-02-06 17:47:25 Depends what you’re using it for. sandwiches and the like, I love a dill aioli. Incorporate egg yolks and canola oil and some Dijon mustard. Then add vinegar, lemon juice, ground dill seed, chopped fresh dill, salt and pepper.
3040 2018-02-06 17:47:13 #PABudget PA and Budget mix like oil and water, TBH.
3041 2018-02-06 17:46:58 That's so much better then telling ppl that McDonald's doesn't change their oil enough and that it's dangerous.
3042 2018-02-06 17:46:48 thank you!  some dogs love it & I wanted to try my dog to see if she does I was thinking about making her some doggy treat biccies with it in. I would probably use peanut oil or coconut oil if I was having a go myself

3046 2018-02-06 17:46:31 I say ww2 because in 1933 the elite were pissed at fdr and anti trust laws that threatened their wealth and power. They failed a coup, then bankrolled hitler. Standard oil, gm, ford, dupont, ibm, all hitler buddies and bankrollers.
3047 2018-02-06 17:46:25 It's no longer a news that majority of min of works budget were used to pay contractors debt so thay the can come back to the site. Aside the money made by these agencies were shared used to augment allocation to state Gov due 2 oil revenue  shorfall

3049 2018-02-06 17:45:52 #PABudget The good, the bad and the unknown. Good - No broad-based tax proposals. Bad for oil and gas industry with severance tax proposal. The Unknown - how can we keep and attract business to grow PA's economy. Stay tuned for more analysis for RKL's state tax experts.
3050 2018-02-06 17:45:30 “Don’t get it twisted sis, I wake up every morning next to a head scarf and coconut oil. I am married to a black queen.” I want a man that says that shit about me when someone tries to disrespect me 
3051 2018-02-06 17:44:59 Nothing like handcuffing progress. Maybe they figured out how to exist without oil... I hope they share their secret with the rest of us.

3058 2018-02-06 17:44:20 That’s rubbish! It’s either the body is deliberately seeking recognition by making stupid statement like this  or generally ignorant of the ongoings in the oil and gas sector of the economy. If there is a price hike and the market price of crude oil dictates so, so be it
3059 2018-02-06 17:44:15 Drink more water, slather that coconut oil, eat healthy and bitch forget about your doofus nig that doesn’t even care about you

3063 2018-02-06 17:43:58 The only link I've seen from you so far is the SuspiciousObservers Davidson oil vid, & I posted rebuttals. It's UTTER BS.
3064 2018-02-06 17:43:52 Kind of. You also have to dunk them in boiling water instead of oil. And then you need to finish their cooking by baking them.
3065 2018-02-06 17:43:49 I have used small amount of coconut oil for rocky road few times with success. Few spoons of toasted coconut added to the mix is lovely too if you like coconut.
3066 2018-02-06 17:43:44 Oil is the foil for us to recoil from spoil that tool has caused to boil.

3072 2018-02-06 17:43:13 Our country, when did you purchase it. This land was taken from the Indians and from others. Just look at how Indians are treated. Tell the truth and spite the devil.

3077 2018-02-06 17:42:55 I lived in Duluth MN in the 70s and a homeowner had a wind turbine in his yard that caught the winds from Lake Superior. I thought, that's the way to go. Other countries are going green and the US is drowning in oil. We have a very selfish government and it's not the Dems.

We put in puppet regimes who get over  thrown eventually.We can’t make these places Democrats if they don’t want it . It’s arrogant to think we can bomb people into being what we want
3087 2018-02-06 17:41:36 Maybe it is time to set some regulations for the Canadian Oil Conglomerates to buy local rather than from over seas market.

3090 2018-02-06 17:41:15 Use a hefe, throw in some hop oil, and strawberry jam. Close enough.
3091 2018-02-06 17:41:12 Given that oil is on it's way out we should truck the oil to port.
3092 2018-02-06 17:41:04 A few years back, when oil first became big, a long with donations. A lone (D) GF legislator put forth a bill to change the rules on campaign finance. It was legal to pocket leftover funds with no reporting on it. GOP members laughed & said why change it, there's been no abuse

3098 2018-02-06 17:40:02 OK, so WHY are there still so many subsidies to oil? Leases for a song, all kinds of deductions, etc. The oil depletion allowance is so ingrained we don't even see it for the massive subsidy it is! Why hasn't it been repealed?
3099 2018-02-06 17:39:53 Britain and France want oil.  France can get oil they earned it. Britain can negotiate. This can be solved in 90 days or less. REFERENDUM is key.

3111 2018-02-06 17:38:36 I REALLY hope this isn't going to relax oil and gas regulations. DOM already gets away with too much, and Virginians noticed your  refusual to take a stand against pipelines. Virginians are watching.

3117 2018-02-06 17:38:00 I saw the video on the internet, it's abt 40 mins. Since I didn't have enough characters, meant to express as critical vs anti. He is much in favor of Russia for energy/oil and China (Asia as a whole) and critical of US & Western policies. We'll see what happens.
3118 2018-02-06 17:37:56 ICYMI: The @VASenate voted unanimously yesterday to pass SB726, which would allow cannabidiol or THC-A oil prescriptions to treat or alleviate symptoms "of any diagnosed condition or disease determined by the practitioner to benefit from such use."

3131 2018-02-06 17:35:28 Your argument makes no sense. I'm not the one opposing oil sands extraction, but those who are do it because the carbon intensity of oilsands energy is relatively high. It's about carbon economics. The more CO2 in the atmosphere the more damage we do to the planet. Read more.
3132 2018-02-06 17:35:21 Fun #Libya story: my in-law works in an oil field in Jkhira.

The Petroleum Facility Guard there once argued w/ the station manager & since don't let him near the airport. Every trip home, he drives 40km to another airport where the plane (& rest of staff) lands to pick him up

3142 2018-02-06 17:34:26 So those Canadians that are so dead set against Alberta oil because they think they are saving the planet really are just putting more carbon producing tankers on the ocean.
3143 2018-02-06 17:34:16 October was a record high, a total of 369,000 barrels a day of crude oil leaving the U.S. for China.

Your heating bills go up and your gas tank runs empty, you'll be happy to know those corporations got a HUGE tax cut!  You got squat
3144 2018-02-06 17:34:13 Yep. Because that's the scam. Once FG shares offshore oil using LGA + Population, you'll see the abracadabra.........Kano 44 LGA. SE has 5 states etc......Elrufai is a sly fox.
3145 2018-02-06 17:34:12 Haha, I follow so many Oil fans it takes an honest 3 or 4 + scrolls to get past the goal celebration tweets 
3146 2018-02-06 17:34:04 Love #argan oil? Remember that it's only made in #Morocco. If it comes from another country, it's probably not the real thing.

3148 2018-02-06 17:33:50 12. So basically, most cool things we find in rocks are linked to the way water interacts with it when its hot! Pretty caves, precious gemstones, mining, and even oil and gas generation are all heavily linked to the flow of water and heat underground.

3151 2018-02-06 17:33:35 Let's say we reduce our Canadian carbon emissions to 0.  Without buy-in from all countries, we're still in trouble.Our oil companies are world leaders in environmental standards.  You kill investment there, you're only giving money to countries without those standards.
3152 2018-02-06 17:33:25 That's right, Trump is the cherry-on-top of a racist, greedy country.

3161 2018-02-06 17:32:47 They were trying to include as many oil fields they could to the England boundary. 
3162 2018-02-06 17:32:42 Changing oil at 3,000 kms is just a bit of wastage to be honest. Looking at that relatively clean oil going to waste...smh.
3163 2018-02-06 17:32:17 Saudi Arabia; the country with the 2nd largest equivalent oil reserves in the planet, is planning to hook over 200.000 homes into the renewable energy network. They invest for a certain future. How about Venezuela, one of the richest country in natural resources in the planet?
3164 2018-02-06 17:32:03 Absolutely agree. Even people who I assumed with have limits are supporting him in everything he is doing, including doing away with the Education, reducing parks and opening them up for oil and gas interests, off shore mining, getting rid of environmental regulations, etc.

3170 2018-02-06 17:31:21 I’ve never gotten an oil change for my car so I called my dad asking where I should go ect. and he said he’ll just take my car to get it done when he gets here in two weeks bless up  
3171 2018-02-06 17:31:13 Elon is one of the dudes who got popular so quick off his inventions that the govt. cant kill him off now withput suspicion. Guarantee theres gonna be a hidden war between oil and electric.
3172 2018-02-06 17:31:08 Once again, tried a moisturizer that had almond oil in it. Guess what? I have a small rash on my face  WHY ALMONDS??!!!  (pretend that’s an almond)
3173 2018-02-06 17:31:00 Beauty enhance feature on smartphones these days tend to beautify one's face much that selfies look like some oil painting 
3174 2018-02-06 17:30:31 miscitos like oil
3175 2018-02-06 17:30:28 Yeah you don't use vegetable oil as a.....well you just don't do that.
3176 2018-02-06 17:30:24 How it affects normal people. That's easy food drink and services go up companies complain because there products are being sold at an affordable price (oil for instance)  the only people who lose out are the normal people not the speculators or hedge fund managers
3177 2018-02-06 17:30:24 OIL DIFF: 3.5 -> 3.54
3178 2018-02-06 17:30:22 The anointing is not until oil is poured upon you. Who poured oil on Jesus? Is 61:1
Anointing is being baptized with the Spirit of God.

3179 2018-02-06 17:30:12 I dreamed @PFTompkins opened an Italian restaurant and I thought I'd improve the oil paintings of birds at the tables by painting stupid captions on them. Needless to say I am no longer welcome in the establishment.
3180 2018-02-06 17:30:10 Whatever bitch told me olive oil was a good dressing fuck, fuck you. Now my salad taste like slippery grass.
3181 2018-02-06 17:29:59 Of course! I almost always use the foaming oil control Cerave, sometimes with a cleansing brush. Also have a few different gentle scrubs around, like the Body Shop tea tree one, for deep cleaning/breakouts.
3182 2018-02-06 17:29:39 This would be great. I suffer from MS and CBD oil is a great help. Unfortunately, can only use when in a state where it’s legal. That’s ridiculous.
3183 2018-02-06 17:29:37 Fake & Real ones fuck it ; lil miss Libra you cooking  I got this oil
3184 2018-02-06 17:29:32 Heated up the KFC chicken for 2 mins and bere oil fam wow
3185 2018-02-06 17:29:18 I recall clearly that Iraq's oil was being divided up post invasion, when things suddenly went south. A British group called Platform later helped the Iraqis' stand up to the multinational oil companies, which nevertheless now control Iraq's previously nationalised oil sector.
3186 2018-02-06 17:29:15 But it sure can afford lotion or coconut oil 
3187 2018-02-06 17:28:51 Even if its paying for subsidy through Oil swap contracts at least we know its for the benefit of the common man and the money is not in private pockets
3188 2018-02-06 17:28:45 EIA sees OPEC-14 crude oil production up by 90kbpd m/m to 32.41mbpd in January. December production was lowered to 32.32mbpd (was 32.54mbpd). EIA forecasts OPEC-14 crude production to average 32.43mbpd (was 32.68mbpd) in 2018 and 32.70mbpd (was 32.94mbpd) in 2019. #OOTT

3192 2018-02-06 17:28:28 I’ve tried to research “your side” before. It’s mainly a political argument. It’s an argument made by oil and gas, coal companies with obvious special interests.

3195 2018-02-06 17:28:06 Kalau okay, takpalah. Tp kurang sesuai sbb cream tu bukan utk oil control & buat skin lg berminyak. Plus, kalau kulit berjerawat pakai vit e, blh buat jerawat makin byk. Dkt thread pun ada yg ckp mcmtu. Tp kalau skin you okay, takpa la kot.

3198 2018-02-06 17:27:53 Will be interesting to see if those bio's take a hit, under WH support of oil industry over "green" energy.
3199 2018-02-06 17:27:52 Shipped to China is great! That means we can offer our excess oil by selling what we have lots of. Our trade imbalance will doom us. We can't sell much to world markets except energy. If Hillary won, gas would be $5 again with libtard climate change taxes.
3200 2018-02-06 17:27:17 @CGasderegulationparino Sorry Charlie, Lower taxes, deregulation, opening oil for drilling & exploration. Changing bad trade deals (I know that's tough for u globalist) all point to 5% + GDP growth. You have been wrong about everything important, including Trump being elected.

3207 2018-02-06 17:26:20 Isn't olive spread (the dairy free kind) just solid olive oil... I use oil in cupcakes and it works fine.
3208 2018-02-06 17:25:55 We only have so much oil why not make as much profit on it while we can? #letsgetrealaboutouroilandgas
3209 2018-02-06 17:25:46 @LBC @IainDale Iain, Dude, you need to get real.  The key is oil, the US is now the world's largest producer, and the US is the only manufacturing center that has its own supply of oil.  Every body else costs more, now.
3210 2018-02-06 17:25:44 This is nothing out of the ordinary  dogma from a party corrupted by used car and snake oil salesman.... they're a joke.

3216 2018-02-06 17:24:22 What are your issues with Alberta?  Why are you against oil it is the diving force behind our economy?  Why can’t we get our oil to the coasts and stop land locking ourselves and selling our oil to USA at a discount?  #freeouroil
3217 2018-02-06 17:24:21 It would put more oil on the market, driving down prices, just before the 2018 midterms...

Might it have something to do with the oil companies big wind fall
3221 2018-02-06 17:23:56 Yes, just like all the people at Standing Rock, right? Did you see how much praying, singing & drumming in peaceful protest got them? Brutality at the level of crimes against humanity.. Did the public swarm the nazi Sherriff working for the oil cos? Nope.
3222 2018-02-06 17:23:46 There's a lot of companies/industries that have an interest in the Arctic. And not just the oil industry. We need to look creatively at private-public partnerships to build infrastructure that will expand/facilitate economic activity in the region.

3228 2018-02-06 17:22:46 @realDonaldTrump Why is gas pricing going up?  This is what I mean about oil companies taking advantage of Americans. Just because economy is good they charge more. If a rig blows up they charge more. Why should we continue to pay over $1.25gal for gas? None. Get them regulated!
3229 2018-02-06 17:22:39 So many great products to choose from. My all time favorite and go to is the CBD oil. I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression along with a lot of pain throughout my body but once I stared incorporating CBD oil sublingually all those problems and all that pain vanished.
3230 2018-02-06 17:22:38 Worth a try, won't happen because despite her public posturing @RachelNotley is not in favor of the oil Industry or the pipeline, that is very clear from the appointments and hiring her government has done

3236 2018-02-06 17:21:56 That’s why there was such a thing as “play clothes” growing up.

Specifically to just play in and get ragged in.
3237 2018-02-06 17:21:53 And what would your solution have been, 2 years ago? What significant solution worth billions of dollars would it have been? And if it's all so easy, why didn't previous Conservative gov'ts have the solution for previous oil price drops? #ableg

3264 2018-02-06 17:18:34 Just saw a post of EIA reporting for 2017 oil market deficit of -0.5 mbd.  They also upgraded 2018 demand to 1.73 mbd. That means we now need 2.23 mbd of NEW oil supply to stay leveled. So why did they published that 2018 would be Oversupplied by 0.2mbd?  Who's bringing 2.43 mbd?

3270 2018-02-06 17:17:50 I don’t hold a candle for what some politician’s random statement.

However the consequences aren’t established. 

If you are this well-read, you should be aware that one of the reasons for oil price decline has been America’s rise of oil production due to fracking !!

3323 2018-02-06 17:10:51 Suggest you take a look at the coal industry and the oil pipelines as two examples. Regulations protect us, the land and the workers. For corporations, regulations detract from their bottom line.

In any case, my feeling is that the oil and gas industry is inefficient and have got away with it cuz of public subsidy. How come the industry is buying up assets if it is broke? We're giving billions

3348 2018-02-06 17:09:08 @SushmaSwaraj  I remember your old tweets on fuel price hike. And now your silence on it is a betrayal to the nation. (Especially when crude oil prices are so low)
3349 2018-02-06 17:09:03 That's absolutely right, we have doctors here in America that have been treating people for cancer that don't even have it the cure for cancer kills and doctors just hope it kills the cancer before it kills the patient. THC and Rick Simpson Oil kills no one

3432 2018-02-06 17:00:33 Everywhere else – Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Alaska – they’re bringing in billions of dollars from the oil and gas industries.  That money’s going to fix roads, build schools, and keep taxes low. @GovernorTomWolf
3433 2018-02-06 17:00:29 price of gas +oil+Besan +onions +tomatoes & other ingredients just doesn't add up.Earning 200/-will be a loss in metros
3434 2018-02-06 17:00:24 Lol... no. I use dishwashing liquid. You know that.. I only use oil when it’s curly
3435 2018-02-06 17:00:21 おーまだ起きてたのかー作業か？無理するなよ？
3436 2018-02-06 17:00:17 Like a vampire, he drinks oil out of robots.

3439 2018-02-06 17:00:09 OIL DIFF: 3.51 -> 3.56
3440 2018-02-06 17:00:06 I hear you, I’ve done a lot of that kind of driving in the winter and I don’t miss it. When I first started in the oil field I hauled bulk cement into the bush up and down hills, across frozen rivers and lakes never mind roads were incredibly rough.
3441 2018-02-06 17:00:05 Custom oil rubbed bronze bar #glassrack. #elegant #mixology
3442 2018-02-06 16:59:57 In San Francisco and had a cup of Kenyan pour-over coffee that like only one hand touched the beans or something and now all other coffee tastes like rancid mung bean oil
3443 2018-02-06 16:59:54 Wired points out that in 2015 "Russian SVR agents, working undercover in New York City, [...] tried to recruit Page, an oil and gas adviser, as an intelligence asset, only to decide that he was too scatterbrained to be a useful source." I dunno . . .
3444 2018-02-06 16:59:52 Yep..just a regular kid. It was mask him up or stuff him in an oil barrel. :)
3445 2018-02-06 16:59:43 It cleans your hair by sucking out the moisture of the excess oil that clings to your hair when you haven’t washed it and gives it a better smell
3446 2018-02-06 16:59:37 My car dealership charged $24 for an oil change. I paid $85 yesterday I'm PISSED to say the least. I will never go back to Jiffy Lube again
3447 2018-02-06 16:59:31 いきてる！
3448 2018-02-06 16:59:22 I'm pretty much that disgusted with the Oil's collection of wingers, so I imagine he is as well.
3449 2018-02-06 16:59:20 its in the oil..
#saveaclick
3450 2018-02-06 16:59:18 Y’all like drugs. Not free car washes and oil changes.
3451 2018-02-06 16:58:41 Hey, I'm just reminding everyone why body oil is a hyper muscle haver's best friend, removes a lot of friction
3452 2018-02-06 16:58:38 Haha I found an old love box I tried to put together for my dickhead ex. It’s got an eye mask, chocolates, massage oil, sexy dice and sexy jenga. I obviously didn’t get to actually use any of it 
3453 2018-02-06 16:58:23 A long term study of oil miners says fracking is safe.  A long term study of drug dealers says cocaine is safe. A long term study of Burger King managers says burgers 3x a day us safe.

3455 2018-02-06 16:57:58 And those telling us of the benefits of the EU are not selling snake oil? The truth of it is somewhere in between there are benefits but are they worth the price
3456 2018-02-06 16:57:56 Try clove oil, though. It’s the most common remedy I’ve heard.
3457 2018-02-06 16:57:56 @KRAPOTKINN 
Do you suggest that all the
Thatcher Economic Architecture was a 
'good thing'  ?
To where did the oil tax revenues flow ?
and how long did that change last
From where did some of the 'right to buy' wealth come ?
and are we still suffering from such #Transfer s
3458 2018-02-06 16:57:50 protesting opening up ANWR for oil drilling by passing a school bus that has its flashing lights on. to arrest me violates my freedom of speech #1A #cobstitution
3459 2018-02-06 16:57:21 Then it was Obama and Hillary job to stop the deal.There are is no excuse for the US to sell strategic materials to potential enemies. We need to increase our own uranium processing. Just like trumps expansion of us energy production. No longer can foreign powers control our oil!
3460 2018-02-06 16:57:18 European stocks end with losses but off lows Yields mostly lower in 10 year.  Gold is down. Oil is lower.  Bitcoin unchanged after earlier tumble
No surprise. The European major stock indices are ending with losses. However prices are off low levels:
3461 2018-02-06 16:57:08 No easy way to resolve KRG’s political & illegal debts; the Fed-Govt is not obliged to bail them out.

Transparency is KEY. Full audit must be conducted on all produced oil & gas in KRI since first production, and all implicated officials should be held accountable on wrongdoings
3462 2018-02-06 16:57:06 The amount of people that don’t know about the Reclamation Projects is unbelievable. You Never hear about that side of the oil companies just what the media wants you to see. I didn’t find out about them till I moved out of Ontario.
3463 2018-02-06 16:57:04 There are people who still don't know that we went to Iraq for oil. There were no WMDs.....what genocide? The Kurds? Because we didn't invade turkey..... 
3464 2018-02-06 16:56:45 That thing where you realize you scheduled an oil change at 3:15 so you have a short day. Yay me!
3465 2018-02-06 16:56:37 Only a brainwashed imbecile would believe that Erdogan and his family were innocent and had nothing to do with the oil transfers from ISIS. 
3466 2018-02-06 16:56:36 Last night I listened an hour to Pastor Lindsey Williams, claims US will begin generating great oil profits.

@BerceuseUltime
3468 2018-02-06 16:56:30 Come on, they bankrupt in the entire country to make the rich richer, giving billions to the oil companies and his buddy Rex Tillerson. Someone better sue these bastards and stop this fake tax legislation before it wipes out of America.
3469 2018-02-06 16:56:24 where can i get Castro Oil from cause Walmart don’t have shit o
3470 2018-02-06 16:56:20 Ctfu ima stick to what I know. I don’t even use oil when I press my hair. So it would fail me right there
3471 2018-02-06 16:56:09 But there is always Next Year.............or the next time the oppressors leave the office. Time to develop a plan and forget about oil

3474 2018-02-06 16:55:51 That is complete horse shite.  Syncrude has a break even price of ~$37 bbl. Suncor is even lower. Oil sands are making money. If you did the research and owned the stock, you would know this.
3475 2018-02-06 16:55:47 **New Top Shelf Arrivals -Chemodobreath &  Peanut Butter Breath now available! Faded Oil by Cultivated $22/g *Tax Included. Huge Savings!**
3476 2018-02-06 16:55:47 Have you tried drinking the "oil"?
3477 2018-02-06 16:55:38 That's the worst! Have you tried garlic and muellin oil? Sounds crazy. Really works on 90% of my family's ear infections. Even the two weird ones I got in my 30's
3478 2018-02-06 16:55:38 Mercedes have been burning oil since 2014 so was not just Ferrari, and every team bends the rules in this sport.
3479 2018-02-06 16:55:11 It’s kinda like when you have heating oil delivered
3480 2018-02-06 16:54:57 CNOOC Limited announced today that the Stampede field, located in the deepwater Gulf of #Mexico, has commenced production.

The field has a processing capacity of approximately 80,000 #barrels of #oil per day, 40 million standard cubic feet of #natural gas per day.
3481 2018-02-06 16:54:50 Nothing to do with GOP.  When my retirement 401k goes south will you bail me out?  Nope.   Your a snake oil salesman and a charlottan.
3482 2018-02-06 16:54:48 join rise oil island night thank af62
3483 2018-02-06 16:54:47 America America America why you people are clinging to America which u very well know it's ruled by Israel. What ever you do you are rubbish for them. The day is not too far when the oil dries u will know your place. Dustbin.
3484 2018-02-06 16:54:44 Don't be silly. Oil is worthless. The UK gov is propping up oil companies with subsidies to ensure we Scots have some employment. 

Worthless. Curse. Negative. Run out.
3485 2018-02-06 16:54:41 Sure seems like it. If your a good local fan go support the oil kings or a junior A team. 
3486 2018-02-06 16:54:36 They can also be found in Fort Worth.

This sounds like a fantastic reality show in the making. IT Geek meets Oil Baron... 
3487 2018-02-06 16:54:17 I just wanted an oil change now my car's about to die
3488 2018-02-06 16:54:16 While state fails, the oil industry which provides 1/4 of the state's revenue has been graced w/lower production taxes. Republicans helping the wealthy at the expense of everyone else.
3489 2018-02-06 16:54:07 At Biofilm S&T Workshop organised by @Center4Biofilm. Challenges for industry -ranging from oil and gas, over plumbing, to food production and processing- are enormous. Good to be reminded of this from people who are faced with this everyday.
3490 2018-02-06 16:54:01 @kingimmense The way Chelsea r going down; they will discover Oil soon. 
3491 2018-02-06 16:53:49 Then I added 3 cloves of chopped garlic, 2 tablespoons of olive oil (I used garlic oil cus garlic is life) half a cup of parmesan, 1/2 cup of chives and some fries basil and 1/2 tsp of salt and black pepper. 200° for 35/40 mins
3492 2018-02-06 16:53:28 Motor oil is no doubt present in your DNA, David
3493 2018-02-06 16:53:19 "In response, the Bush administration terminated the supply of fuel oil that was essential to the agreement-and then North Korea quickly kicked out the U.N. inspectors, restarted the nuclear plant & began developing its nuclear weapons, using the material in radioactive fuel".
3494 2018-02-06 16:53:01 @JimStoppani would taking alpha jym with a bulletproof coffee/tea with coconut oil in it work as “take with food?” and be absorbed properly?
3495 2018-02-06 16:52:53 To @davidfrum , @MaxBoot , and other "Neocons," dead brown people are just collateral damage to re-make the Middle East for entrenched oil and gas interests.
3496 2018-02-06 16:52:49 Oil now down maybe
3497 2018-02-06 16:52:41 .@GovernorTomWolf Over 30,000 Pennsylvania children annually will experience asthma attacks due to ozone smog resulting from the air pollution released at oil&gas sites. Children in PA need a healthy environment. #PABudget

3499 2018-02-06 16:52:17 Probably to protect oil tankers shipments from China & Russia, also coal exports.  
Sanctions?
What sanctions?
3500 2018-02-06 16:51:55 Oh dear sweet Brian!!!    She relly must try and use the olbas oil or vick the vapours are most    Ummmm “easing”
3501 2018-02-06 16:51:53 do you rub the oil on your Head ??
3502 2018-02-06 16:51:49 The US government dropped the ball a long time ago on renewable energy. Trump doesn't want it because he sucks dinosaur juice.his has been the issue through the last 3 administrations. That's why China is the leader in renewables. America sold out to big oil. That's GOP & DEMS.
3503 2018-02-06 16:51:40 yes! Luna oil first. Make sure it’s absorbed completely, then Good Genes!
3504 2018-02-06 16:51:10 Visit us before Feb. 18 & we'll donate $5/oil change to the Alberta Polar Plunge in support of @Alberta_LETR & @SpecialOAlberta. #medhat

3509 2018-02-06 16:50:49 on a related note, the resilience of oil has been a surprise to me
3510 2018-02-06 16:50:44 constructing a sky scraper on the old indian burial ground, hoping the pressure crushes their bones into oil to power my wifi network
3511 2018-02-06 16:50:42 I bought a random oil at marshalls. didn't read it that good. It's rosehip n avocado face oil. I think it's alright but I need to use it more to really see if it's for me.
3512 2018-02-06 16:50:39 Aug 18 2017 I pin about Oil, what oil needed to come back. Notice how oil has move from $51 per barrel to $65.27. Seven months, time & patients.

Rebuild our pipelines to keep America safe and reduce energy costs.

3526 2018-02-06 16:49:06 We need a 21st Century prez. Coal & oil are outdated & hurt our planet. Clean energy would also create jobs & put us on par with the rest of the world.
3527 2018-02-06 16:49:04 some ppl aren't even worth fussing with , just throw some coconut oil , proactive  and some good soap at they ass
3528 2018-02-06 16:49:03 They definitely should have invited an economist, but the Canadian, Glen Murray, brings a useful perspective. He led the development of cap and trade in Ontario and served as environment minister. Pembina mostly works on oil/gas shale research. Not an enviro think tank.
3529 2018-02-06 16:49:00 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
3530 2018-02-06 16:48:40 You're in the pocket of big pharma and oil. You have majority in both houses. Truth is GOP can't govern for shit and blame everyone else.

3542 2018-02-06 16:47:25 Stealing oil, you may know it as “bringing democracy” to “troubled” countries ... which is bullshit, your interference has only created more turmoil in the regions your country has decided to steal from, I mean “bring democracy” to ...

3550 2018-02-06 16:46:46 Is it that time already. Fairy tales at bedtime. The oil you refer to is British and forms part of our GDP. Like all countries we could borrow against our GDP and there was no such bankruptcy. WE thinks the brown stuff you refer to is not from us
3551 2018-02-06 16:46:20 Senate Conservation is hearing SB 189 Assurance for Plugging Oil & Gas Wells. We urge #nmleg to vote yes. We need to bring assurance levels up to modern day levels to allow abandoned wells to be plugged.

3560 2018-02-06 16:45:13 Is is okay to say that Americans and America is a country that has built its wealth on slavery and killing millions of innocent people to get their oil? No, because some Americans did build their fortunes in that way, some did not. Thought it's quite obvious.

3563 2018-02-06 16:44:50 Are you kidding me? Stealing oil and throwing over democratically elect governments because they don’t kiss the United States ass is not to “fix every country in the world.” The United States only brings instability and misery to every country it touches with its filthy claws.

3574 2018-02-06 16:43:47 I eat chips because of the crunch. To take the crunch out of chips is to take icing off birthday cakes, oil out of weed, stars out of the sky, fish out of water. Holy these special women can pour water, milk or pop on their Doritos and use a spoon.

3594 2018-02-06 16:41:34 For what it's worth I don't think you should include metaphysical descriptions because you don't believe in that stuff (neither do I). Seems a bit "snake oil salesman-y." You could keep a list of the so-called benefits and supply it on request.
3595 2018-02-06 16:41:16 Cauliflower, garlic, 2 eggs, bit of oil, chives, salt and pepper. Shape them on a tray and in 40 mins you're in heaven  they weren't mushy at all. Crispy on the edges and softer in the middle
3596 2018-02-06 16:41:14 @realDonaldTrump Mister President! Please stop buying Venezuelan oil! Vzla is a narco dictatorship. There is corruption, there are many political prisoners + many people died, who protested against this government. There is hunger, there is a lack of medicines. It`s very urgent !
3597 2018-02-06 16:40:58 Well it differs for everyone, but I would use coconut oil during the day and olive oil at night with a stocking cap

3627 2018-02-06 16:37:17 This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard of. The oil company should have footed the bill then fought their insurance company for reimbursement.

3662 2018-02-06 16:33:09 To be fair, he stayed on point. The entire cpc economic platform focuses on a diversity of issues "whether it's oil... or... uh, um, uh..."

Add in the "hating on liberals" intro, and he really covered all the bases with that one

3664 2018-02-06 16:32:41 It’s always funny when a newbie comes in. I wonder if he’s forwarded the “boycott this gas station and break the oil industry” emails. Also the “keep Facebook free”posts

3666 2018-02-06 16:32:06 Update RTC Van Dyke Rd Leighton Buzzard, 2 cars involved in RTC, no persons trapped. Fuel and Oil spillage left with  Fire Service, who have just come away from incident.
3667 2018-02-06 16:32:03 A fair amount, actually. Last time I looked, Scotland had no car industry, small financial services, agriculture and aerospace sectors and an offshore oil industry nearing the end of its life. Oh and there's scotch and some fish, of course. Anything else?
3668 2018-02-06 16:32:01 If it works on oily skin, it probably won't work for me  but I've had better results with layering an oil primer under concealer, so I'll check out that one if Ulta's concealer is a dud for me!

3713 2018-02-06 16:27:06 That’s such a comforting thought but, I am allergic to so many different foods I can only trust homemade. Used to have gluten free chips from a place where they cooked “human” fish in batter in the same oil. Sick every time afterwards!
3714 2018-02-06 16:27:00 Ha ha ahh yes the cardinals DO enjoy a crisp black oil sunny seed
3715 2018-02-06 16:26:47 Make your friend go crazy like a Duracell bunny with Dr. David's CBD penis oil. Your girlfriend will be happy.
3716 2018-02-06 16:26:43 yes, but how many times have you Bang-kok'ed in Thailand? :)
For the record, I'd give you a full oil massage every day even here in Canada!

3720 2018-02-06 16:26:19 @BankingGOP interesting the Banking GOP on Crypto currencies asking for warranties investors have. Years ago got oil companies stocks when barril was 100+ USD. Now check it today. Any investment involves risks. Maybe implement in schools financial education in general.
3721 2018-02-06 16:26:10 They already steal coconut oil from their queens
3722 2018-02-06 16:26:10 If you're up for it again, I would recommend trying some fried chicken from the BB.Q Chicken chain. They fry their chicken in 100% extra virgin olive oil. Enjoy your time in South Korea Jim!!!
3723 2018-02-06 16:25:44 With coconut oil or bacon grease.
3724 2018-02-06 16:25:02 Isn't it amazing how we live in a land of make believe. Stocks drop on speculation. Oil prices are driven by speculation. MSM and fake news.
3725 2018-02-06 16:24:56 SAM tosses it onto the holy oil, which lights into a ring of fire springs up around the barn.
3726 2018-02-06 16:24:35 They could just start buying oil from US instead of other sources and push the bilat surplus down, right? (perhaps this highlights why bilat surplus not a great criteria)
3727 2018-02-06 16:24:26 omg...that is pure unadulterated snake oil!  I'd ask if there are any laws but really at this point we know that as far as the repubs go, it's the lawless wild west all across the country.
3728 2018-02-06 16:24:24 Oil heat- $1270

3733 2018-02-06 16:23:33 Charity begins at home. If our house is not in order do not expect us to help or pay for anyone else. You call it hate OK send me $500bucks so I can get some heating oil. Maybe buy a steak for dinner.
3734 2018-02-06 16:23:26 in that case lock up the government for supplying ISIS with weapons and allowing them to sell oil.

3739 2018-02-06 16:23:03 What stands out most is selling off $350 million in strategic oil reserves "for maintenence of the facility". Is that normal? Seems like it would affect oil price a bit?

3750 2018-02-06 16:22:14 They’re not even a technical solution, though. They’re snake oil.

3752 2018-02-06 16:22:07 This is great news! But what is the stability and pay of those jobs? I imagine many nuclear and oil workers earn very substantial salaries.

3760 2018-02-06 16:21:27 Yeah it’s super gentle! Obviously, seeing a dermatologist is important to pinpoint it exactly, but oily skin can come from not properly hydrating the skin. Also always make sure to look for oil free moisturizers!
3761 2018-02-06 16:21:24 ... or just use almond oil directly on hair ...  ;)
3762 2018-02-06 16:21:18 What I want a first date at my house for? Let’s go to an art show, wine tasting, artisanal olive oil store. Can you niggas at least act like you got some goddamn couth?

3797 2018-02-06 16:17:37 Interesting link between economics and oil.  After Spindletop we had to find ways to use all the oil before it was worthless due to the increase in supply #texashistory
3798 2018-02-06 16:17:34 just putting it out because i learned recently some oils can be bad for animals - such as tea tree oil, so if you're into difusers and such keep that in mind.

3801 2018-02-06 16:16:59 I am not suggesting one fixed solution. Some products can use other vegetable oils, some can use palm oil alternatives and some don’t even require the oil at all! It is also detrimental to the health of millions.
3802 2018-02-06 16:16:27 Do u think , with shale production rising again , Oil prices would slide ?

3805 2018-02-06 16:16:16 Well that's certainly the attitude we are seeing. I guess we can celebrate the fact that BC can continue to import oil from places that would not let folks protest it in the first place. Keep supporting Russia, Saudi Arabia, etc.
3806 2018-02-06 16:16:13 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, and a terrorism crisis.
3807 2018-02-06 16:16:11 They SHOULD.  After all they were so happy that the oil industry was in recession. We'll be doing them a favour taking it off their hands.

As for refining oil not tar in AB it’s not feasible (from a corporate stand point) these companies have refineries else where with lower taxes n lower enviro standards why build where it’more expensive?
3813 2018-02-06 16:15:20 Talk ab’t contrast? R, Kevin McCarthy “joked” King & Rohrabacher on Putin’s payroll.2014’s Ron Paul, Giuliani, Buchanan, Peters, “Rev” Graham’s public rating of Putin >”O” was no joke. 2014, when oil spiked killing Russian, Alaskan, offshore, Arctic, Texas oil economies.

3854 2018-02-06 16:11:24 Lmfao!!!!!! In that case I'm know for oil rig drilling 
3855 2018-02-06 16:11:21 Please can you make Nutella vegan so we can all eat it!
Oh and please without the palm oil too!
3856 2018-02-06 16:11:16 something is written in the oil by the puppet: Down or Byre. your whippet shouldn't even HAVE a oil.
3857 2018-02-06 16:11:14 MCE used "fake" foods made from stabilised corn oil. The attempt to double blind a diet trial led to some frankenfoods. Not claiming processed is always bad but we today have no way of finding out how their processing affected its effects.
3858 2018-02-06 16:10:59 Looking at Dow Charts to trade Crude oil now...
3859 2018-02-06 16:10:54 Actually vegan cheese made from coconut oil is quite good.

3862 2018-02-06 16:10:44 Dilute some peppermint oil in water, and spray on your plants. Odor keeps insects away, mixture does not affect plant health.
3863 2018-02-06 16:10:40 Black seed oil is the nastiest shit ever. It has great benefits, it cures everything tho
3864 2018-02-06 16:10:38 As the article rightly points out, this is only a tiny fraction of @BP_plc overall CAPEX. Their projections for oil & gas demand remain completely out of line with the #ParisAgreement targets

3869 2018-02-06 16:10:26 You need an oil change

3873 2018-02-06 16:10:10 Hi Wendy dear. Thank you. Hoping you have a super great day. Just came in from dropping my car off at mechanic. Needs oil change. Sending much love & many hugs!

3876 2018-02-06 16:10:02 McDaniels will be introduced tomorrow afternoon in a press conference at Lucas Oil Stadium.
3877 2018-02-06 16:09:53 What day yesterday in the market.  What’s everyone got for API & EIA this week? #OOTT #WTI $CL
3878 2018-02-06 16:09:46 @Oven_oil
3879 2018-02-06 16:09:41 The cost of a barrel of oil is underpinning CAD
3880 2018-02-06 16:09:36 Pretty sure we been in a recession since the crash of oil started in July 2014, we are are the incline economically across North America so anyone that is speaking to a recession coming , my question to them is - what rock have you been hiding under? ...........!   IMHO
3881 2018-02-06 16:09:29 Someone left a shower gel in showers when I was in army used it was full of rifle oil dam
3882 2018-02-06 16:09:24 McDaniels and his family will be introduced Wednesday, possibly at Lucas Oil Stadium.
3883 2018-02-06 16:09:23 Brady had to have his weirdo personal trainer/holistic guru/snake oil salesman removed from the Foxboro complex grounds for distracting the rest of the team and undermining the Patriots training staff. That's WAY worse than missing a team plane for the flu.

3885 2018-02-06 16:09:20 Well, let's really look at it. The person said grains, lean meat and canola oil. That's not representative of MCE. Lyon swapped butter for a canola oil based margarine, more grains, red meat swapped with chicken. Isn't that far more representative than MCE diet wise?
3886 2018-02-06 16:09:14 可愛いメーター
3887 2018-02-06 16:09:12 So glad you asked, Manami! It depends on your skin type! If your face is prone to dryness, a thicker lotion may be the best choice, but those with higher oil production must consider a lighter gel-based moisturiser instead! Of course, cleansing and exfoliation are also important!
3888 2018-02-06 16:08:55 乳首片方なのか！？たいへんっお乳張っちゃうと痛いから吸ってあげなきゃ兄弟で
3889 2018-02-06 16:08:49 Vegetable oil only! I was just foolin around with you. Come on Kelly have a little fun while we still can! Do you know in China if you are a Christian and the government finds out you are, they take their Social Security away?

3893 2018-02-06 16:08:17 Waiting for an oil change and @PriceIsRight is on. Everyone is playing along.
3894 2018-02-06 16:08:17 Converting oil to plastic is not a bad thing for the environment. Plastic is not CO2.
3895 2018-02-06 16:08:10 Oooh that’s true. I think I’m just gonna stick coconut oil on the ends!
3896 2018-02-06 16:07:44 If your mans don’t know how to change your oil or fix a flat tire you dnt have a boyfriend you got a girlfriend
3897 2018-02-06 16:07:37 @anjelahjohnson have you tried the baking soda/coconut oil mixture I told you about?! I’m telling you girl, I haven’t had a pimple since I started using only that wash my face!!!!!
3898 2018-02-06 16:07:36 Why it's almost as if the Norwegians decided to think about the long-term wellbeing of their country when oil was discovered. Tony Benn was right when he said the UK was going to squander it all.

3900 2018-02-06 16:07:31 Since when is oil used for cooking? Oil is used not to burn food on surfaces now but I can't think early people soon noticed oil work well with food.
3901 2018-02-06 16:07:24 Lol it's actually an oil that our body produces naturally and can't also be refined from olives and sugarcane
3902 2018-02-06 16:07:21 Had to stand on top of it to clean the vent hoods and in the process the pan covering the oil slipped under me. 
3903 2018-02-06 16:07:18 Bau Tea tree oil ni memang tak menyenangkan. Tapi tu la, fungsi dengan baik.
3904 2018-02-06 16:07:09 Goodmorning, coconut oil on your face causes build up and will break you out also everything by St. Ives is garbage, have a great day
3905 2018-02-06 16:07:06 I imagine him as a giant oil tanker of promotional jackoff jizz carting itself from continent to continent ...

I have a weird imagination ;)
3906 2018-02-06 16:06:45 Yeah, my dad does that. I’m going to be 43 in June, I might start sucking down fish oil or milk of magnesia. A bottle a day! Until then I’ll just keep washing my hands.

3908 2018-02-06 16:06:38 I was gonna finally get my car washed and detailed today after my oil change and whatnot and it’s supposed to rain for like the next 2 months lmao
3909 2018-02-06 16:06:31 There a piece on what happened last season? Was confused. waring aliens, black oil, supersoldiers, was that supposed to have been a BIG FIB?
3910 2018-02-06 16:06:29 can you tell me, does it have palm oil in please?

"According to nutrition information found on McDonald's website, dimethylpolysiloxane is used as an anti-foaming agent in the oil used to fry foods including french fries, Chicken McNuggets and fried fish sandwiches."

3918 2018-02-06 16:05:40 Think I’m going to do a hot oil treatment tonight
3919 2018-02-06 16:05:35 It doesn't break u out? Wow cause coconut oil is a 4 in the comedogenic scale. Meaning, it will likely clog pores. Argan oil and Shea Butter are a 0! = clog free :)
3920 2018-02-06 16:05:25 なにそれ振り切れるやん
3921 2018-02-06 16:05:12 #CBDuse how do you use your CBD oil?
3922 2018-02-06 16:05:04 We usually use Liberty Discount but they would've taken 2/3 days so we used Stiff Oil since they came next day! Definitely recommend
3923 2018-02-06 16:05:03 So you are deeply invested in oil? 
You'll believe their propaganda over 97% of world scientists too right?
3924 2018-02-06 16:05:03 Not sure I'm emotionally ready for a new episode of #ThisIsUs tonight when I'm still recovering from Sunday's episode.  I'll be using a combo of dōTERRA's Console and Elevation blends to prepare myself. I also have to keep reminding myself it's just a show.  #doterra

3929 2018-02-06 16:04:53 Coconut oil isn't amazing for lips honestly. Squalane does wonders on it's own.
3930 2018-02-06 16:04:44 What I like to do with healthy food is to stir fry them in a bit of oil along with some soy sauce, sambal and a little bit of ginger and have rice or noodles for an Asian inspired dish! Works with quite some meat or with an omelet if you don't like meat :)

3962 2018-02-06 16:03:52 Hence why I like my CBD oil in the am
3963 2018-02-06 16:03:46 I was happy to! My job is so focused nowadays on identifying oil reserves that I rarely get to talk about the fun scientific parts of geology. If you have questions about specific minerals or gemstones that you want to know more about, I'd be happy to answer those too!
3964 2018-02-06 16:03:41 Tar sand needs $70/BBL to be profitable, American oil is around $65-90 BBL. That'll create problems with $4.50/gal refined gasoline.

We block foreign export as part of NAFTA, you'd know this with research.

Without NAFTA there's Asian markets begging for it even at $70 BBL
3965 2018-02-06 16:03:40 a warning to all my budget beauty babes out there: The Ordinary’s famous $7 foundation is super light with nice coverage but also made me break outthough it’s marketed as oil free, it contains highly comedogenic aka pore clogging ingredients. huge #bummer

3971 2018-02-06 16:03:00 I believe Trump is truthful about companies pouring into America. He removed all protective regulations. Trump, big oil &  mfg. don't care if a Mom or Dad gets cancer from toxins. or babies are born deformed or die young from disease. Trump deregulated health for us & the planet
3972 2018-02-06 16:02:55 BIG OIL owns all legislatures in Oklahoma. They crontrol the masses. They control the money. They want ignorant Oklahomans so they can keep that control. What arent you getting? Langston bought. Tom Cole bought. Pruitt bought. Falin bought. Oil owns our school funding.
3973 2018-02-06 16:02:52 you want full coverage? too faced born this way concealer, it has coconut oil & hylaronic acid to hydrate and helps calm sensitivity in the skin

3983 2018-02-06 16:01:34 Peppermint oil in scalp!!
3984 2018-02-06 16:00:59 There has been much talk about diversifying the Nigerian economy especially since the fall in oil prices that plunged the country into a recession. The tech industry is regarded by many as the future of the Nigerian economy, after all, tech is said to be the new oil, right?

3992 2018-02-06 16:00:33 I seem to remember Trump touting Page as "an oil and gas guy, very smart".
3993 2018-02-06 16:00:33 Well, of course they do. That was one of the agreements made by Kissinger when OPEC was set up. Use the USD for oil trading and you get the support of the US military. It’s just the US protecting its oil interests. Nothing more. Thugs.

4000 2018-02-06 15:59:39 Such incredibly tired arguments. The idea that, merely because we need oil for some purposes (don't worry, bioplastics are on the way), we should consume it at its current rate, is frankly absurd.
4001 2018-02-06 15:59:36 Why the fuck would you take auto if all you’re going to do is stand around and fight over who’s going to hold the bolt covered in oil bc you don’t want to get dirty??!

4023 2018-02-06 15:56:43 The Sugar Cookie mask DOES have tea tree oil in it, so it will tingle/sting a bit at first! I've found that it's best to NOT wash your face beforehand. However, the stinging will subside after a few minutes and diminish, as the tea tree oil is working it's magic on your pores.

4067 2018-02-06 15:51:12 But wouldn’t that technically be breaking the fast? Both BCAAs and coconut oil have calories, thus your calorie intake is starting as soon as you do this.
4068 2018-02-06 15:50:57 Tuesday IRL today...more climbing or do you guys wanna watch the GOAT struggle at changing his oil?
4069 2018-02-06 15:50:51 It appears that in the trump administration, any kook, snake oil salesman, or crook can make recommendations and approve them with no real input from the American people.  When and where is this going to stop?
4070 2018-02-06 15:50:46 Headlines say inflation fear is infecting the market. I wonder if it's more the fear of central bank overreaction, as occurred in Q3 2008 when oil was rising and the CPI ticked up. 1/

4076 2018-02-06 15:50:22 Did they stop draining your oil from the office on a snake's face when it shows.
4077 2018-02-06 15:50:13 actually you can use it without serum. shampoo and conditioner is fine. or you can use pure olive oil before wash your hair
4078 2018-02-06 15:50:12 Cardio and coconut oil is every girls bff.
4079 2018-02-06 15:50:04 But a partisan hack like Prashant Bhushan won’t mention that, and you’ll swallow whatever snake oil he peddles.
4080 2018-02-06 15:50:01 What do u call ppl who never solve any problems ? Lazy. Be a problem solver. Today I'm going to solve some problems. The squeaky wheel gets the oil or nobody does

4084 2018-02-06 15:49:43 Dear President @MBuhari we can't continue to pretend that all is well in the oil sector, the poor folks are suffering.
4085 2018-02-06 15:49:39 Because you support Big Oil and you dont believe fracking is real. That's ignorant propaganda made up by Fox News. There was a reason drilling stopped for months in Oklahoma until Pruitt was put in EPA. Even ignorant Falin admitted to it after Cushing earthquake.
4086 2018-02-06 15:49:35 I learned that I also prefer calming silence to bee oil and parade threats.
4087 2018-02-06 15:49:25 Coconut Oil Skin Uses
coconut oil is the do-everything oil with next-to-zero downside. It's loaded with good fats that provide energy for our bodies, fights microbes, and it's excellent for cooking. Coconut oil is also very good for the skin.  By itself, coconut oil can be drying

4092 2018-02-06 15:48:57 Pimples form when excess oil clogs up your pores, so limiting the amount  of oil that you put into your  body in the first place is a step in the  right direction.

4094 2018-02-06 15:48:37 The "establishment" is the group of people that go into office in order to be rewarded by the Banks, Military Indust. Complex, Big Pharma, Big oil, etc... These people don't corrupt politicians, politicians are flagrantly corruptible. 

No one has ever retired from congress broke
4095 2018-02-06 15:48:24 Do they actually know the difference between the different types of ships? Could they even identify an oil tanker vs and grain carrier? ??

Hey Jocko. I love your podcast, book, krill oil -everything 'Jocko' basically!  Most of all I'm loving your "GOOD" approach to challenges/negative  circumstances. Have you heard of Dr. Carol Dwek? She's done research on growth vs. fixed mindset...

4111 2018-02-06 15:46:51 Right, but what do you think will happen to that oil after it has been transported (the stuff that doesn't leak, polluting the watershed and our coastline habitats)? Most of it will be burnt, ergo, greater CO2 emissions, not to mention other pollutants.

4115 2018-02-06 15:46:23 I was wondering how the small quantities can be exported, but remember that ISIS was doing just that - smuggling crude oil and selling it off. There's been rumors that truck loads and truck loads of oil are driven off in the dead of the night.

4118 2018-02-06 15:45:45 Woke up sick. Car wouldn’t start after an oil change. I’m an hour late for work. I’m pretty sure the courtesy driver is going to kill me. And I have a mile-long to-do list. What else do you got for me, Tuesday?

4140 2018-02-06 15:43:06 Key point in that sentence was the debt was doubled on giving away 80% of taxes to the wealthy...to which they will not see a single thing for them. Nothing. (besides the snake oil argument that they will have their plates filled by the wealthy dropping things from their mouths).

4163 2018-02-06 15:40:05 IMO, the problem is that the tariffs put in in place now while US production capacity is unable to meet demand & CANNOT meet it for several years - after the tariffs sunset. This punishes consumers, retailers, and installers.
I see this as an indirect coal/oil subsidy.
4164 2018-02-06 15:40:05 @phemsworth 
Pat, Why have gasoline & heating oil prices fallen over the last week (along with crack spreads)? Does this reflect weakening demand. I'm still trying to understand falling Brent/LLS - WTI spreads. Thanks, Art

4190 2018-02-06 15:36:15 Canada already subsidizes oil and gas to the tune of 34 billion a year. Yet the capitalist want more government support. Are they capitalist or socialists? Imagine if renewables received that a year.

4254 2018-02-06 15:28:30 Just to give hope again regarding the common home, Pope Francis has proposed the Laudato Si' which indicates leaving the energy that comes from fossil fuel and return to renewable energy. We must follow such a document and not criticize it defending oil producers
4255 2018-02-06 15:28:30 @oil_winkdeep 오일샘안녕하세요... 헉....저..그... 반가워요....>_<!! 실수시면어떠카지.....빠르게 맞팔하구 도망가요...총총총
4256 2018-02-06 15:28:20 Peppermint oil for sure. There’s also a pressure point in your hand between your thumb and index finger, closest to the bone of the thumb. That helps a lot too if it’s a sudden one. Hope this helps.
4257 2018-02-06 15:28:17 And while we go back to old energy, China is busily kicking our ass and preparing for world dominance in alternative energy, which is in fact the future, orange fuckwit macho rhetoric about 'coal and oil' aside.
4258 2018-02-06 15:28:15 Dropped off the car for the overdue oil change this morning. But now I am craving some orange juice. Anyone free to deliver some to my office?

4261 2018-02-06 15:27:52 Thank Alexander, I thought for a while that the fish was the only pollution-free until it was discovered contaminated as a result of the oil leakage in the shallow seas
4262 2018-02-06 15:27:39 UK's entry: botox and plastic surgery. Ireland's entry: fake tan, fake tattoos and baby oil. #eurovision
4263 2018-02-06 15:27:35 So what you’re saying is if we cut off oil, we will find a way with other sources of energy? I agree.
4264 2018-02-06 15:27:30 I just realised that there is no data on how much the certified palm oil is exported from Indonesia (RSPO/ISPO).
.
The available data is just the CPO in general.
4265 2018-02-06 15:27:24 That was so deep I found oil
4266 2018-02-06 15:27:16 Walmart gets on my nerves lol they mentioned my missing door handle in their evaluation after they change my oil.. lol I know mfs .. I know!
4267 2018-02-06 15:27:15 Why is there a shortage of barite? The oil and gas drilling market has grown substantially worldwide due to the demand for energy. The barite demand tracks with energy demand. There has been limited exploration of new barite deposits and new mines are required to increase supply.
4268 2018-02-06 15:27:09 One of my friends keeps trying to get me to try bulletproof coffee and my friend, my dude, my guy. I don't even cook with oil or butter if I can avoid it bc my stomach is that sensitive to fat, how do I get this through your head

4283 2018-02-06 15:25:18 Everything is made for light oil now. Everyone is offering free 3yr maintenance, so the dealers don't want the maintenance visits. I think the lighter grade and higher std help with sludge control and take higher heat (turbo applications), as it scoots through there quicker.

4293 2018-02-06 15:24:14 Yes correct. Currently use only mustard , ghee and coconut oil.
4294 2018-02-06 15:24:11 That’s a painful oil splatter waiting to happen.
4295 2018-02-06 15:24:08 On the plus side, the weather will start warming up for you much sooner than in the UK, so you'll be able to start reducing your oil use earlier, too, and maybe not need it quite so soon in the autumn either? XXXX

4301 2018-02-06 15:23:26 People should be allowed to spend their money and live the way they want. If they do not want fossil fuels than fine; Exxon & the others should respect their decision and shut down their activities now. No more gas, no more oil & no more shipping and no more jobs or tax revenue.

Whereas knowing about how the price of wholesale gasoline is moving would be far more useful to many consumers who are driving, fleet managers, etc.

4322 2018-02-06 15:20:55 Wrinkles appear on the skin as you age when aging skin starts to lose  its ability to hold on moisture, makes less oil, and is slower to heal.  It also produces less collagen, and because collagen is what makes your  skin smooth and elastic, wrinkles start to appear.

4410 2018-02-06 15:11:38 Oh no!!!!  Fortunately, there are other forms of canine therapy. I, honestly, thought it was just a bit of snake oil salesmanship before we started. But when the veterinarian said she was recovering in about half the expected time, I was convinced.
4411 2018-02-06 15:11:37 @ImamSuhaibWebb Salaam Sheikh, whats your opinion on using CBD oil to treat inflammation. The Oil has the psycoactive ingredient THC removed from it but its still derived from Marijuana.
4412 2018-02-06 15:11:26 Its not all about oil!  With or without the oil we will be better off away from Westminster rule.  It’s not about SNP it’s about Independence. Statistics are just that, statistics. Whatever figures are fed in gives a result which can be read in varying ways.

4427 2018-02-06 15:08:36 Blocking Alberta oil is like shooting oneself in the foot.  All of Canada benefits from this resource as we are still dependant on it. If it gets phased out, so be it, but now is not the time.

4437 2018-02-06 15:07:25 Unless you are advocating nuclear, its very hypocritical  for anyone regularly using oil and Gas to argue that we should not use any finds we make in Ireland and instead continue to import.

4554 2018-02-06 14:54:42 I had a dream last night where some friends and I were blamed for kidnapping a rich oil tycoon's daughter, but his daughter was just an American Girl doll and nobody realized he was crazy
4555 2018-02-06 14:54:41 But what about plastic being a by product of petrol industry? There cannot be climate stability if we kew pumping oil. Indeed there is more than it meets the eye when dealing with environmental issues
4556 2018-02-06 14:54:40 @SRuhle seeping out, NOW the R party of autocrats is more evident. But many of us have been trying to stop this since jerk Reagan began destroying labor in the 80s, since Ws war for oil.  NOW some of you Rs are shocked??  Really?
4557 2018-02-06 14:54:27 Whatever is done in the darkness shall be brought into light. Why hide information about oil if indeed it for the benefit of Ugandans?

4568 2018-02-06 14:52:59 Sorry but you haven't answered the fundamental question. Given that there were many years (peak oil) where our contribution to the UK fiscally outstripped what we received, why would anyone decide that leaving when we are now net fiscal recipients is a good idea?
4569 2018-02-06 14:52:16 Hey @HelpfulHonda how likely are you to change my oil while I'm at work? I'm at 15% (1st time ever) and don't have time until next week to go to the dealer.

4577 2018-02-06 14:51:28 Hi Rob, while our P&C recommends growers should avoid planting on peatland, we recognise that efforts need to be continually improved to further the fight against deforestation and GHG emissions from palm oil production 1/4

4581 2018-02-06 14:50:51 If this so called Union was equal it might be different but sadly it’s totally unequal. Yes that’s why Westminster wants to keep us because of our resources and finances purely and simply.  And I’m not even meaning purely oil.  We are ruled by Westminster not along with.

4588 2018-02-06 14:50:13 Problem with Canada addressing climate change the global issue, is that Canada is slightly less than the proverbial drop in the bucket. Strand ALL of our oil & the difference is...not even rounding.

4602 2018-02-06 14:48:07 We already know oil has been discovered. We need to know the rate it flows at. I’m still hopeful but it’s very 50/50 for me. An even money bet that could pay 20/1

4808 2018-02-06 14:25:59 Around 70% of the world's soy is fed directly to livestock and only 6% is turned into human food. The rest is turned into oil. So if you have concerns then the only thing to do is go vegan.
4809 2018-02-06 14:25:52 I went for signs and swords. So like a pure sword spell build. And the combat takes some getting used to its a lot of dodging and countering.

4810 2018-02-06 14:25:50 Your expensive wooden worktop got marked by an Apple HomePod. I get that you’re upset.

So it’s a niche issue only affecting wooden worktops treated with Danish oil. 

It seemed like you were personalising things.

4812 2018-02-06 14:25:48 Your skin is drawing moisture from the foundation thats why its flaky. You need to make sure you are using a cream or oil cleanser that doesnt foam, also you may want to add a facial oil into your skincare and Clinique Overnight Moisture Mask is AMAZING!

4974 2018-02-06 14:07:37 My hair DOES NOT like coconut oil. 
I tried doing a scalp treatment with Castor oil, tea tree oil and used coconut oil as a base oil and I swear I heard my hair whisper "you're fucked" when I tried to detangle it.

4984 2018-02-06 14:06:19 Further, in order to economically ship oil to Asia, you need to use large ships (VLCCs).  Unfortunately, you can't fit them into Vancouver.  Northern Gateway and now Eagle Spirit are needed even more.

Anyway I really hope it's not lavender that gives you an allergy.
4996 2018-02-06 14:05:13 China is one of the few places in the world where refining capacity was GROWING.  If we had a way to get oil to tidewater, we could sell to Asia, and the prices would rise.  The existing KM pipe is also moving refined product (so Vancouver residents can fill their cars).

5010 2018-02-06 14:03:41 You have a point about multi-National behaviour in less environmentally concerned jurisdictions. Why not make it easier to do business here were we have laws and environmental concern. But that’s not your real agenda. Foreign funding to keep clean Canadian oil off the market is.
5011 2018-02-06 14:03:27 Oil is not the cause of war. Over-sized and over-powered govt is. The petro-dollar exists because it was the only alternative left after exiting Bretton Woods and any link to Gold, enabling unrestrained money printing to finance the war- and welfare machine.

5200 2018-02-06 13:40:28 Joe,

I worked for one of the most successful big oil/gas companies.  Its philosophy was to pay down debt in good times and use their strong financial position in bad times to acquire additional assets at bargain prices.  Why isn't some version of this a good idea for the USA?
5201 2018-02-06 13:40:21 Gotta put butter and mct oil in it
5202 2018-02-06 13:40:21 The $53.1B Dec. trade deficit is the biggest monthly deficit since 2008.   if you exclude oil, its the biggest monthly deficit ever.  In #Trump's 1st year in office America's already huge trade deficit swelled by 12%. Instead of winning on trade, we are now losing big league!

5211 2018-02-06 13:40:04 Canada has enacted pollution laws & developed technology to reduce the impact of oil extraction on Canadian pollution that surpasses ALL major producing nations. The US, Russia, China, Europe, Africa, & Middle East have no intention of crippling their economies by following suit.

5217 2018-02-06 13:39:19 You’re an exception. Use what works for you but yeah coconut oil has a tendency to clog pores and cause breakouts that take forever to clear up on most people.
5218 2018-02-06 13:38:40 What allowing new #offshore lease sales is key to, is securing Big Oil's ECONOMIC future. The key to energy security lies in the renewable energy sector. Period!

5241 2018-02-06 13:35:57 Click on the links in order and that should help.
You can obviously do so in your own time.
Essentially think of the world's oil as the replacement for the gold in the days of the gold standard.
That oil has to be traded in dollars underpins the otherwise worthless currency.

5276 2018-02-06 13:30:59 RBI is likely to keep its policy rate on hold, but could toughen its warnings against inflation.

But the oil question (and even certain EM markets) is interesting. Fundamentals remain strong. 
This is a markets pricing matter. I wonder if the two can diverge?
Seems unlikely if we get true risk off moment, but worth contemplating.

5291 2018-02-06 13:28:15 Because Scotland adds lots of value to the UK and we are not a drain. Pooling and sharing means that when our revenue (esp oil) is high we have been net fiscal contributors to the UK at times. Why do you want to rip us out while we are net fiscal recipients? It makes no sense.

5344 2018-02-06 13:20:30 That's Why They Don't Legalize Mary J cause the pharmaceutical pushers don't want competition and you can include the oil companies in the same scenario
5345 2018-02-06 13:20:28 I am very sure it's only in Nigeria they sell groundnut oil as olive oil. It's actually not fair.
5346 2018-02-06 13:20:12 @AIT_Online
The sudden support for States to start controlling Oil resources inland is as a result of discovery of oil in the North. #PPP
5347 2018-02-06 13:20:11 Ha ha! I hear ya. I'd settle for one of those oil slick things you see in James Bond movies or cartoons so I can watch them spin off the road.

5354 2018-02-06 13:19:17 Don't count out the oil just yet. They'll be murder if they get in the tournament

5356 2018-02-06 13:18:58 Oh yes, absolutely. No excuse for that. I'm just saying, when there's a 'squeaky wheel gets the oil' situation, it trains people to be squeaky, to nobody's benefit.

5359 2018-02-06 13:18:44 Excellent points. A deal is a plus-plus for both. 

For Iraq its increased leverage with all oil counter parties. While for the KRG it could lower the KRG oil discount to Brent. Also, it could lower some of KRG's high expenses such as Services & Suppliers at 17% of oil sales
5360 2018-02-06 13:18:38 Shame on you!! You are turning on #Canadians who 'CARE' about this country! and #FirstNations in favour of #Oil. Shame shame shame! We are all hard working caring Canadians. You, are dividing us.
5361 2018-02-06 13:18:19 Al Gore won the popular vote over George Bush. Some believe that the election was stolen due to ballot boxes found discarded after the election in Florida, a stated governed by Jeb Bush. How did that turn out.  Ignored warning of 9/11,Iraq war over oil, recession.

5373 2018-02-06 13:16:31 Some have viewed bitcoin as a naive hankering for a gold standard...but the gold standard problem was the ‘turning an oil tanker’ analogy...impossible to respond to things like currency runs
5374 2018-02-06 13:16:26 Inflation: The inflation     projection for FY2019 is likely to be ratcheted higher to the ~5% YoY     range, with risks to the upside including higher crude oil prices and     closing of the output gap.

5377 2018-02-06 13:15:53 Thanks...... it’s either diesel or domestic heating oil..... the Environmental Agency are helping me 
5378 2018-02-06 13:15:47 If that were true, you would be working harder to ban foreign oil imports from countries with little to no environmental protection, but then payments from these foreign governments to your eco-traitor organizations in Canada would dry up.
5379 2018-02-06 13:15:38 Did you manage to find any relief im off work today serious sciatica down my right side a friend told me about mustard oil  warm up with  candle has given me a bit of relief
5380 2018-02-06 13:15:30 Yes it is truly the most disturbing aspect of all of this. That the @GOP has failed in their oath to support and uphold The United States Constitution and that they have sacrificed their constituents for this snake oil salesman and his crime family. #VoteBlue

5384 2018-02-06 13:15:18 The #Kurds of #Afrin are appealing for help from the #Syria-n Government, the same Government their fellow Kurds are stealing two thirds of Syria's oil from.

5392 2018-02-06 13:14:36 I'm not saying stereotypes are ok, but I am highly entertained that, even though I eat constantly, everyone seems to think I'm not eating enough. 

I'm surviving on a diet of red wine, espresso, cheese, fruit, veggies, and olive oil. It's brilliant. ♡

5395 2018-02-06 13:14:09 Ask Conway what his boats runs on ... it don’t run on fish oil! That’s why their allowed to survey... it’s an essential resource. @VOCMOpenline
5396 2018-02-06 13:14:03 Actually the oil companies have done this. They think they are more important than anyone else. They have us all by the balls. Youve all backtracked because of them.
5397 2018-02-06 13:13:59 ...fine and dandy...just dont 'accidentally' dump any more oil into the ocean, will ya...
5398 2018-02-06 13:13:56 @Bojangles1977 Was hoping that you fixed the issue with cooking chicken or fries in same oil as your fish sandwich. But no. Still the warning that it can’t be guaranteed. Bring back the fish sandwich means I’m very limited at what I can get at Bo’s. #disappointedagain

5401 2018-02-06 13:13:42 Well..The article argues that sustaining the current policy will not be a problem absent some major unforeseen event (oil price collapse)but on the last 2-3 lines it states that any change will come as a tactical decision to improve relations with the West..Nothing solid abt it..

5428 2018-02-06 13:10:48 It seems to me that anything that would divide our country to this degree is a bad investment. Are you being fully honest with #Canadians?! These #oil barons really have us by the balls don't they? #PremierNotely #MinisterPhillips #PMTrudeau. I think you have underestimated...:(
5429 2018-02-06 13:10:47 I mean they bot 19.75% shares in rosneft which deliver them ( mean BP) 30-40 % of hcarbons/ oil production. If such asset deliver only 20% production i would say netback zero asset
5430 2018-02-06 13:10:37 I think being out of fuel, etc etc is surely sufficient reason for a foul mood.

When are they getting there with more oil?

5433 2018-02-06 13:09:57 Anyways invest in solar, the Saudis are moving away from oil. Thank me later.

5463 2018-02-06 13:05:41 Absolutely...but his silver tongue ERG extremism will prove base metal & alienate more of the moderates & anyone with an open-mind...he's preaching to the existing #Brextreme converted... as I said Snake Oil salesman in a suit...doesn't mean he's not a threat...
5464 2018-02-06 13:05:41 I personally don't understand the fuss being made about the wording 2day -All previous RNS's eg 16th Oct, 15th Nov etc all say exploration discovery and 100% owned "potentially moveable hydrocarbons" that is still the case as we know the oil is there & there are natural fractures

5480 2018-02-06 13:03:40 #Russis: Oil companies signaled support for the government’s output-cuts deal with OPEC as complaints made last year dissipated.
Producers were less critical after Brent crude hit a three-year high in January, with the average -BBG #OOTT
5481 2018-02-06 13:03:36 Same thing I complained about the other day. In Akwa Ibom, we have mainly offshore oil. Onshore oil is of minute quantity. Why claim the offshore and leave the onshore for us. That's broad daylight wickedness. Thanks for enlightening folks here. APC restructuring plan is fraud.
5482 2018-02-06 13:03:19 Getting my valves adjusted, callipers rebuilt, steel braided brake lines installed and fork oil/seals changed at @MSW_Ottawa. The #SRAD is going to feel so fresh this spring!
5483 2018-02-06 13:03:09 @NigelSlater what a great idea for Zatar. I’ve used it on pita and as a dipping sauce with olive oil but this is a must try, thanks!
5484 2018-02-06 13:02:47 @VOCMOpenline The Ocean Ranger inquiry not only affected the local oil industry, but changed the entire global offshore oil industry... Best practices referenced around the world, which are now considered standard can find their origins from that inquiry.

5492 2018-02-06 13:01:23 At last they see the unwisdom of minimising the oil fields!  Shrunken assets do not impress investors.

5529 2018-02-06 12:55:48 Well I just read the BBC breakdown of the video and it does not talk about Trump whatsoever

- H20 inferno is a reference to the west’s dependency on oil

- The mushroom cloud cotton candy is obviously references to nuclear weapons 
Etc etc
5530 2018-02-06 12:55:38 So I just saw a commercial about how oil rig operators train as a team on simulations so they can "stop problems before they start" because "safety is #1" Great i guess....but ask yourself the last time a solar grid or windfarm exploded or leaked poison.....hmmmmm
5531 2018-02-06 12:55:24 My little one needed to train those tight curls.... took a while.
Spray rosemary water (book rosemary for ten minutes & cool), coconut oil, olive oil or shea butter (or mix them all)

5617 2018-02-06 12:39:45 Pretty much. There's a mildly interesting argument that oil was a little vulnerable due to TAs + elevated fund net longs (with a lot of them from macro funds rather than specialists that may be rotating amid the fun). Dollar rebound obviously not helping either.
5618 2018-02-06 12:39:43 #ukog Yes but it also said Oil Discovery in the RNS on 27th Dec, then Went on to say no commercial flow in the lower KL3 and below.  We know it’s a discovery, we don’t know it flows, which a different proposition.  Let’s hope the end of tests proves +ve flow rates

5783 2018-02-06 12:14:35 Hi we recommend using standard veg oil but you would probably be OK to use seasoned oil as through subsequent cooking you will continue to build up layers of flavour anyway. Be interested to hear how it goes!

6042 2018-02-06 11:27:09 Inflation and fluctuations in oil prices. Also the charge that is required for business to process a credit or debit transaction. And also the fact that (may not be really that funny) the gas stations are out to get ya!

6187 2018-02-06 10:57:27 He never compared Brexitbods tosnake oil salesman. Mr Glover incapable of following thrust of interview or dishonest. As interview moved on it was a general point about some politicians of ALL persuasions. But then if the cap fits? And here it did and does.
6188 2018-02-06 10:57:18 I meant 'human' attention as the new oil, but you have a point too. We'd need to consider machine attention too very soon given the number of bots being used for assorted purposes.
6189 2018-02-06 10:57:14 There was one in the main article to magazine and not an academic journal. It reads like a dissertation. There is no major institution listed as the study backers (red flag) The paper wtitings method’s used we’re analyzing maps and reading biodata and applying theory
It’s big oil

"If after 50 years of independence you have not built the necessary infrastructure for your people are you humans?

6191 2018-02-06 10:56:00 I heard that oregano oil pills can help with the chem-flu. Some have used Cipro, a very strong antibiotic. I heard it's a very touch one so take care and rest. They are spraying it all over the USA,

6200 2018-02-06 10:54:07 Red states are worse off b/c of GOP trickle down economics. Texas for example has been awash in oil money for decades. Yet their wealth disparity is worse than many other states & their public schools & poverty levels are as sad as anyplace else in the US when that need not be.

6203 2018-02-06 10:53:33 Not sure why those are insults? Plenty of evidence of lying (against parliamentary code of conduct), they are selling something that doesn't work and is impossible to achieve hence snake oil salesmen and really you don't think brexit is a shambles?

6207 2018-02-06 10:51:54 Exxon 300kbpd, BP 100kbpd and Shell around 200kbpd by 2025. That is not very large increases from Big Oil in the context of what is being forecast. It looks like those wall street barrels will need to take the slack
6208 2018-02-06 10:51:33 Also, the widow collected empty pots from her neighbors trusting God to fill the pots for her. She locked the door on herself and children, and then called on God in faith that then filled the pots with oil (2 Kings 4:1-7).

6217 2018-02-06 10:50:40 Exactly. It’s the public purse in the end that bails the bankrupt companies out after an oil spill disaster. Meantime their complex scheme of shell companies gets them off the hook.  How about ENOUGH real $$$ held in trust, as security?  . . .  Nah, this coastline is priceless!

6227 2018-02-06 10:48:41 Quite frankly American news sources are not the place to get correct information on Latin America especially Venezuela,WSJ has one concern there that’s  oil and a Government that will bow to the empire.
6228 2018-02-06 10:48:40 I’ve seen one or two Tarantulas out on these old oil well sites at work.  Last one I saw was about the size of my hand.  Was all black with light tan body.

6230 2018-02-06 10:48:20 Fair enough! I guess it's a belated return after they ditched their renewables investments first time around. And not sure it's exactly shifting their business model away from oil & gas... :)

6236 2018-02-06 10:45:08 Truth hurts?  Telling the truth seems to be pretty painful for Sarah and everyone else involved with this administration, but...    sure.  Say, how many uses DOES snake oil have?
6237 2018-02-06 10:44:31 This is just as bad as the person using ORS olive oil hair care for cooking olive oil

6239 2018-02-06 10:44:22 The single most important revenue stream for a bank is Interest Income on Loans. Most of the huge corporations like Dangote and International Oil Companies get huge syndicated facilities and pay interest income. That's the main way customer deposits are put to use.
6240 2018-02-06 10:44:22 He was such a great part of the show and if I had to pick my one favourite moment it was the one where he tried to oil he's chair because he knew the squeaking annoyed Fraiser. Just thinking of that scene makes me chuckle.

6248 2018-02-06 10:41:41 Of course there would be loss of revenue.
But they can negotiate a transition and agreement that makes FG responsible for degradation up till the date of restructuring.

It supplements a ton of fish oil that works wonders for me but the added zinc, I believe, is doing thngs I am not fully aware. I go out a bit more and feel slightly more comfortable.

6271 2018-02-06 10:36:25 He did not compare Brexitbods to snake oil salesmen. The conversation started about JR-M accusation and moved on to general point about ALL who want SC to say something in favour of them. Prior he mentioned politicians of ALL parties who had changed things. But if cap fits.

6281 2018-02-06 10:35:06 Oh good! So cheaper gas?keep dreaming. Oil companies need to keep stocks high so refineries develop a crisis and charge more.
6282 2018-02-06 10:35:03 global oil prices have dropped amid recent dollar strength, with international benchmark Brent futures hitting a one-month low of $66.90 per barrel earlier this week. A fall in global oil prices is seen as positive for India as the country imports the bulk of its requirement.
6283 2018-02-06 10:35:02 Feels like the next 2 months rally could actually be led by commodities... with oil holding on here at least good valuation support for energy equities

6292 2018-02-06 10:33:04 If it tastes bad it’s probably gone rancid, and you shouldn’t use it.  Rancid coconut oil has a sour, piney, unpleasant smell.  It doesn’t smell like coconuts.  Good fresh virgin coconut oil should have a bright coconut smell and light pleasant taste.

6473 2018-02-06 09:58:53 Possibly it is equivalent to five football fields daily that are being lost but the exact rate of deforestation cannot be estimated accurately as in addition to large commercial operations many small-scale growers/small holders are planting oil palms too

6490 2018-02-06 09:55:26 Dear @tabnrgy, we've not tested that, but your intuition seems reasonable. But currently I'd expect that EVs are (based on market prices alone) not yet competitive. In Green Paradox context we'd expect an oil glut decreasing prices even further. I hope this helps you.

6565 2018-02-06 09:35:26 As benefeciaries can't afford with rising oil price,costly imported LPG will go into the hands of Black marketeers at farflung areas and incentivise poor people to sell their cylinders at premium in the black market. Many such black money will go to ruling political system.

6577 2018-02-06 09:32:40 Clearly nothing had changed, its still about the "OYEL" staying in the firm grips of the federal government, most foreign oil companies have already sold their onshore facilities to local biz bcos of constant attacks & clashes.

1-"floating on oil"

I've already proved that Scotland's geog. share of oil REVENUE brought in ~£200m (all allocated to Scotland) in the last year. We spent £71.2bn in the same period so "floating on oil" makes no sense

6671 2018-02-06 09:08:08 According to the NBS, Nigeria has produced crude oil valued at approximately $330 billion between 1961-2014. Unfortunately,  that such gains has fail to improve the lives of Nigerians, neither has it been properly utilized to develop the economy (Ndubuisi & Chineme, 2017).

6686 2018-02-06 09:04:58 Reading @APCNigeria's restructuring report & it's proposals for resource control, one can't escape the conclusion that it's deliberately skewered to favour a part of the country. And it's still deeply rooted in Federal Govt's ownership of oil.

6698 2018-02-06 09:02:18 Yes, @LToddWood  , there is a tax windfall from domestic petroleum production.

There’s also a huge benefit to 25% of the private sector, too. The US Oil Sector exclusively uses domestically produced equipment and services.

It also reduces the US trade deficit, substantially.

6741 2018-02-06 08:52:03 Y’all swear water and coconut oil solve everything!
6742 2018-02-06 08:51:53 What are the failed economic policies? The failure to save when oil was $120/barrel or the wanton looting to prosecute election
Put that beside the $42b foreign reserve, increased non-oil revenue, coming out of recession, stable fx & more prudent mgt of resources...2/3
6743 2018-02-06 08:51:42 One consolation 
Government will give duty free cooking oil for frying PAKORAS.
6744 2018-02-06 08:51:42 I definitely do! It'll serve me well in the long run. However I'm still concerned by current practices, the cynic in me says the industry is infested with snake oil salesmen but the other side in me thinks it's a lot of misguided people who simply don't do their homework.
6745 2018-02-06 08:51:35 Wow @BP_plc producing at 247 million barrels of oil a day according to the BBC. That’s nearly triple the daily world oil production. How are prices so high ?

6756 2018-02-06 08:50:59 Gosh. Another flat-earther who believes that a country of 5M that is floating on oil, whisky and high tech is subsidized by it's neighbour of 55M who is 2 trillion in debt with a brexited economy based on dodgy financial services?
6757 2018-02-06 08:50:52 Petrol diesel prices surging. Oil companies making huge profits by cutting common men pockets. They say hawai chappal hawai yatra. & train fares going up thru dynamic pricing. It's all to benefit pvt airlines. Why privatise air india

6770 2018-02-06 08:46:55 Imo China this year is a tossup btw crackdown effect on economy v reluctance to crack down too much on credit. US is about fiscal stimulus in strong economy. Oil prices wild card
6771 2018-02-06 08:46:47 It's considered a legal barrier to trade. Japan should have gone somwhere else IF they needed oil so bad. They were already winning in China at that point.
6772 2018-02-06 08:45:44 So after review, I do not have to reroute Covenant. After watching @TideRuglia most recent run, it looks like it does indeed save 3 minutes, which you lose for immediately causing it to balance out. The only place in New Game the Strike oil saves you time is Mecha lord

6865 2018-02-06 08:29:46 Of course they can't.

6870 2018-02-06 08:29:26 Wrong again Bill.

When the oil price was high and thus revenue was strong we were net fiscal contributors to the UK. This is no longer the case, and at this point we are net recipients. This is not a subsidy, it's the smoothing benefit of pooling and sharing. Do you understand?

6898 2018-02-06 08:24:49 Absolutely. Aid is a scam. FDI in most instances is neocolonialism. In the name of jobs, take a look at how multinationals treat out citizens who are employees. Take a look at what oil and gas coys do to us, our environment and livelihoods. Its bizarre but their time is UP!

7032 2018-02-06 07:59:40 Done my research...the oil cleansing, face sponge and toner steps definitely sound worth incorporating!

7095 2018-02-06 07:44:43 The original text said "convert" because they chose their words carefully.
The thermodynamics are depressing. Some of the low energy density of (coal, oil, peat) is converted to high energy density (electric genny), while most is converted to even lower energy density (steam).

Not much (any?) info on human health. 4. More research is welcome. 5. Neither of us has actually dealt with a dilbit spill.

7141 2018-02-06 07:36:08 We'll probably not since the reasons why it's dropping is actually because they fear inflation because the economy is on fire and also to they're fearing anticipation of a interest rate increase and with oil prices dropping.

7148 2018-02-06 07:34:17 This is genuinely great but lets not lose perspective: Our economy runs on oil... so to speak. Unless we find that alternative, we wont be banning them for long.

7156 2018-02-06 07:32:43 I feel once media starts talking about Modi win not looking certain for 2019, inflation rising due to higher oil / weak Rs / increasing US10Y yield; and general public starts discussing it also, then will be time to go all in.
Till such time, take a sip sip
7157 2018-02-06 07:32:41 When did you become such an amateur sleuth? You’ve always been a snake oil salesmen who can lie with the straightest of faces, looks like you have a lot of jobs, including maintenance of the president at his belt line. Enjoy this plate of nothingburgher with a little crow.

7160 2018-02-06 07:32:23 Avoid mousses. They make the curls look nice, but try it out sooo much. Coconut oil treatment like 1-2 times a week overnight helps a lot, the night before shampoos. And obviously comb from the bottom up to avoid breakage.
7161 2018-02-06 07:32:01 Moar chilli oil?
7162 2018-02-06 07:31:59 Made #glutenfree naan breads last night. Sorry no picture, they got snaffled. Used our grassroots white bread mix but added #daiyfree milk instead of water and dairyfree butter in place of oil. After proving added crushed garlic clove & chopped coriander and parsley.

7175 2018-02-06 07:29:54 The perfect storm that was set to devour emerging markets seems to be finally developing. Higher oil, lower risk appetite, devaluing currencies, continued political risk. Turkey will need to navigate very carefully from here if it doesn't want a big hit.

7177 2018-02-06 07:29:47 Coconut oil helps a lot with the dryness! I shampoo 2-3 times a week and condition every time I was my hair (3-4x a week).

7182 2018-02-06 07:28:36 @namo_office  Dear Sir, Crude oil market is down but still you people daily increase oil price in India. Do you think you are doing a great Job. A big No because it's directly or indirectly affect the normal people as a high Inflation and price hike in other commodities.

7190 2018-02-06 07:27:14 was nothing to do with interest rates, but you almost hit the nail on the head with Oil. Deflationary worries and index and ETF re balancing worries started it.
7191 2018-02-06 07:27:09 Waterworld confounds me. Humanity has somehow lost the word "plane", as they call them "skyboats", and "oil" which they call "go-juice" but golf puns still exist when the villain says that losing an eye and having poor depth perception "better not screw up [his] short game"??

7287 2018-02-06 07:05:26 I put forth the extra effort to put on coconut oil every night after my shower trying to make sure my body feels amazing for Cole just for this nigga to tell me I smell like a condom
7288 2018-02-06 07:04:36 ...completely abolish palm oil. Contrary to what many say, does it really aid the farmers...? Many are underpaid and would probably benefit more from other sources of employment if we could help to provide that. Palm oil seems like a lose-lose situation...
7289 2018-02-06 07:03:48 And shakers as a result of big oil.
7290 2018-02-06 07:03:34 There's no resolution, becos the oil US/Israel want is in East Syria, Kurdish territory. If Turkey kills of Kurds, subdues rest of the population, then the US/Israel can "grab all Syrian oil"(Trump's words), including GolanHeights which Israel annexed in 60's & drilling now 4 oil
7291 2018-02-06 07:03:22 Why just Dem senators? No Repugnants? They support going to a losing war by attacking NK!? Well, I guess they did support going to a losing war with Middle Eastern guerillas for some oil.

7309 2018-02-06 06:58:37 @BizCouncilBC fear mongering over temporary jobs when your oil could destroy far far more. No, you cant destroy OUR province
7310 2018-02-06 06:58:17 The monetary system is 99% dependant on the petrodollar. The more countries that buy oil outside of US currency, the quicker it'll collapse

The Ark is set during a post-peak oil crisis in the near future, during which a group of scientists and their families retreat into a bunker tunnelled into Mount Kosciusko. It is a novel-in-documents which tells the story of what happens in the first 2 years in the bunker.

7445 2018-02-06 06:34:04 We agree about renewables. So why are we still subsidizing fossil fuels? Why is there still an oil depletion allowance? Why does tRUmp want to directly subsidize coal? Why did he carefully slap a 30% tariff on solar panels? It's a suicidal strategy.

7478 2018-02-06 06:26:22 "I have a lucrative oil proposal for you" is one of the more interesting bits of spam I've had for a while. Straight to the point.

7493 2018-02-06 06:22:57 No that is not how it works. If demand is > supply then prices rise until demand falls to match supply. Exactly what happened during oil crisis.
7494 2018-02-06 06:22:55 Drones are already being deployed in the inspection of oil rigs in Nigeria. These will one day be autonomous drones. The drones have cut the cost of rig inspection by 70%. The “robotic rough neck” might soon be heading to the rigs in Nigeria.

Sounds like political decisions in a democracy in the classical sense, to me.  A BC gov't representing the view of the citizens that elected it. As opposed to representing the view of oil corporations? Or provincial gov't dominated by oil corporations.

7585 2018-02-06 06:06:24 Petrol prices in India are near three-year high today. Global crude oil is at least $3 lower than Feb 2015. What kind of market-linked price deregulation is this?

7698 2018-02-06 05:46:33 You only need a very small amount of massage oil, so don’t get carried away. Dab the massage oil on your hands (not on your partner’s skin), then rub your hands together for a few seconds to warm it up.
7699 2018-02-06 05:46:26 Massage oil reduces the friction between your hands and your partner’s skin, which keeps you from pulling the delicate hairs on his body.

with that.

7710 2018-02-06 05:44:01 So easy...olive oil, onions, peppers, garlic...caramelize the onions pepper garlic, remove from pot-cut and cook sausages, then add tomato sauce and everything, add spices...simmer-when pasta cooked, (other pot) add that in too!

7712 2018-02-06 05:43:54 You've got to reward those oil barons. The Koch brothers have deep pockets. Heh, they're the "deep state".
7713 2018-02-06 05:43:48 Make sure you allow the oil to get really hot first (when you see bubbles) then add the corn kernels, that way your not waiting as long before they start popping. If you shake regularly they should all pop. Don’t worry I have eaten plenty of burnt popcorn over the years!

7996 2018-02-06 04:56:29 Why I HATE essential oils
1. New snake oil
2. I'm very sensitive to smells & they trigger my migraines. Extremely rude to subject others to what you think smells good
7997 2018-02-06 04:56:13 Is your butt having some Monday misery? The restorative powers of lavender are a great remedy. Lavender’s resonant frequency is the same as Neptune’s cool glow. A dab (or dollop) of essential oil will pull your butt right out of that funk.

8052 2018-02-06 04:46:13 This works for me. Not more than 2 minutes on each side. The side with the skin, slightly longer, if you like the skin a little crunchy. Before that add some (olive) oil to the pan and let it heat up. You want to hear that sizzle sound when you put the salmon on the pan.

8142 2018-02-06 04:30:56 He always takes the edge off, its the little things like helping me to undress, oil my scalp, a massage , running bath water, making my plate after I cooked. He still that nigga after all this time & that's Dope AF.
8143 2018-02-06 04:30:24 What is disappointing is the scale and depth of reform is sooo shallow when compared to the massive mandate they received. And low oil prices.

Modi govt has wasted a once in a lifetime opportunity of combinations with a coy approach to babus and UPA corruption. 

Sad

8145 2018-02-06 04:30:11 I have acne, redness/flushing, and patchy dryness. I just started using niacinimide & a face oil. I think it's probably too early to see if the former is helping but the oil is with my dryness! A lot!

8149 2018-02-06 04:29:50 I wonder if the premiums went up when the Oil got 97.
8150 2018-02-06 04:29:27 I got my hopes so high earlier, to make brownies... but when I got the kitchen.. there was no oil. I cried lol

8154 2018-02-06 04:28:44 Some days I wish that “Big Oil” would buy up all of the fossil fuel leases and then close up shop for a couple of years just to see if the environmentalists survive without energy.
8155 2018-02-06 04:28:43 Y’all think drinking this lavender essential oil gonna help me go to sleep?
8156 2018-02-06 04:28:41 1500 miles over due for an oil change!!

8160 2018-02-06 04:28:12 @SrBachchan Good Morning Sir, it’s great to you across the Mumbai on hoardings. Just a little concern, Rice Bran oil consumption on daily basis isn’t great for health. Hope you and your family are using all the natural oils for daily consumption.

8163 2018-02-06 04:27:55 Impact will be even more in India due to heavy dependence on oil imports.But oil expected to fall due 2 reducing demand in US. Play cautious
8164 2018-02-06 04:27:46 I put baby oil and lotion on my legs after shaving them. Now I can’t stop rubbing my legs like a cricket.
8165 2018-02-06 04:27:45 They are only paid to protest oil pipelines..
8166 2018-02-06 04:27:44 It’s frustrating to know that my pain could be “controlled” by taking opioids. The drugs that have claimed the lives of THOUSANDS of people each year. The stuff my late boyfriend worked so hard to get out of the hands of pill mills and dealers. But a harmless oil, can’t have that
8167 2018-02-06 04:27:27 ... and the wee hours await you. Good luck. Toastmasters tomorow and then oil change etc. for my Yukon. Leaving next Thursday before sunrise for my trip out west.
8168 2018-02-06 04:27:26 Russia traded stolen emails to help to Dump’s campaign (as well as that of many Republican Congressmen), in exchange for help circumventing American sanctions to transact the sale of Rosneft oil co, which Putin desperately needs to finance his budget deficit. Muller is on it!!
8169 2018-02-06 04:27:26 Feel like I might be getting sick.  Large headache, chills, etc  no cold symptoms or upset stomach. Should I take some airborne?  Any other ideas?  No crazy essential oil ideas please. #sick #illness #help #Flu2018

8171 2018-02-06 04:26:59 AB digs tears up its land, pays out its dividends across the country, while Northern BC ships its oil through AB pipelines. In order for Canada to get paid, it’s important that BC and AB work together.
8172 2018-02-06 04:26:42 If u think u have an ear infection try oil of oregano (capsules) A friend told me and it cured mine 2 yrs ago. Ever since I use it for earaches and other infections.
8173 2018-02-06 04:26:26 What the actual hell. You are a real oil painting
8174 2018-02-06 04:26:25 castor oil bby, my eyebrow lady tells me all the time
8175 2018-02-06 04:26:18 The only economic trigger I know of is that oil is expected to go up a decent amount soon-ish. But that’s been known for a while.

8177 2018-02-06 04:26:09 I love Rachel Notley's government. The ABNDP has done an amazing job of pulling Alberta out of the hole the PCs created and is just, just, just turning things around. BUT, I do not support a Kinder Morgan pipeline expansion! The coast is too fragile to trust to oil tankers!
8178 2018-02-06 04:26:01 It's disappointing to see someone who seems to be so intelligent spread an idea that's so obviously dishonest and foolish.  Obstructing oil sands extraction, right or wrong, is SPECIFICALLY about protecting the environment. Blocking trade is a consequence.
8179 2018-02-06 04:25:49 でも、不器用な私は針をクルックル回しちゃって、糸をこんがらがせちゃうんだろーなー。
8180 2018-02-06 04:25:46 The fact is that there are going to be folks who will never again job. But this is not due to the NDP. This is the new economy. Big oil has tons of assets and yet still fires folks and the NDP get blamed? Give me a break. The industry is inefficient and has to learn frugal.

8189 2018-02-06 04:24:44 Its just a lot of touching ur face and less room for the pores to breath so maybe they produce more sweat/oil??? i dont fucking know but it ruins everything
8190 2018-02-06 04:24:34 I dig your grossness fully  I am super comforted by the smell of manure when passing farms so I'm weird too. And yeah, driving past skunk smell is more interesting than gross I suppose! It's just the fresh oil that is hella gnarly
8191 2018-02-06 04:24:13 I cook mostly with butter or coconut oil but I really wanna try cooking with avocado oil cus I bet that’ll give food an amazing taste

8198 2018-02-06 04:23:15 Nikki Haley is not even a US Citizen, much less Represents the US. STOP with all the Lies to promote your Stinking Wars for the Banks & Oil. We've had enough. #StopWars NOW!
8199 2018-02-06 04:23:13 I did get a gift today. I was out supporting my local Black owned businesses.... So I got my hair cut, and then went to buy this body oil right....
8200 2018-02-06 04:22:53 Gas hasn’t gone down in California, but oil has fallen. I hate Jerry Brown.
8201 2018-02-06 04:22:44 You need to cleanse, tone, steam, apply serums/oil, and moisturize. I steam with my serum on because my skin gets dry in harsha weather.
8202 2018-02-06 04:22:37 Please this is about Maduro kicking out American oil companies nothing more. Saudis are a theofascist monarchy far worse than many dictatorships. This is about my country wanting resources.
8203 2018-02-06 04:22:30 Thank you Suzanne. Very kind of you. Clearly you are a Jedi Master. Your students are so fortunate. For some reason, oil pastels enable expressing that energy more freely.
8204 2018-02-06 04:22:18 I've been looking to do this and make my own CBD oil!
8205 2018-02-06 04:22:11 just found out why I've been getting rashes after using my T!! Turns out I'm allergic to the linseed oil it's suspended in...
8206 2018-02-06 04:21:53 You really should check out BKSU. Purest quality of JeJu Oil on the market. Can be found also @kmall24 . Can't live w out!
8207 2018-02-06 04:21:50 I was talking tourism, but film is as volatile as oil -- and just as throwaway!
8208 2018-02-06 04:21:42 If that is the extent of the build, oil inventories will be at the 5 year average before April 2018. A 2.8m build isn’t much for this time of year. Wti should be closer to $70 than $63.35. Fundamentals will prevail.
8209 2018-02-06 04:21:36 stop buying palm oil
8210 2018-02-06 04:21:25 Definitely removed a rather impressive collection of dirt dobber (wasps) nests. No issues found other than oil change and new battery, both of which I knew were coming. At least this is a sealed battery

8216 2018-02-06 04:20:37 Anti-aging hand treatment - soak your hands in milk for 15 mins. Rinse then apply a bit of olive oil on them.
8217 2018-02-06 04:20:21 So no growth oil and stuff??
My friend is angry that you haven’t acknowledged his existence. He however thanks you for answering his question.

8224 2018-02-06 04:19:23 Well, my clients would say otherwise. I’m quite great at what I do. There are certain products that are all around not recommended for ANYONE, such as raw lemons for dark spots. I’m not prying your beloved coconut oil from you. Keep using it if you must.
8225 2018-02-06 04:19:22 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
8226 2018-02-06 04:19:18 Idk what I would do without tea tree oil
8227 2018-02-06 04:19:03 Unless there is real pain, there is no trend reversal. I remember oil at 27 and USDRUB at 85. That was stressful. People said it will go even lower - oil to 5-10, RUB to 200 per USD. Huge volume candles on MOEX. That was the low point.
8228 2018-02-06 04:18:56 Here is a recipe for cooking any kind of testicle. Skin them, freeze them for 20 minutes or so, slice thinly, dredge in egg, seasoned flour, then egg again, fry in skillet with oil that's rippling not smoking, serve immediately with marinara sauce and a squeeze of lemon. tada,
8229 2018-02-06 04:18:39 What a shame he isn’t quite good enough to make oil a playoff team.
8230 2018-02-06 04:18:37 I now know 10x more about the 2010 bp oil spill than i did one hour ago
8231 2018-02-06 04:18:12 Because sucker like you believed into voting for an incompetent and con snake oil salesman  who has nothing to offer to “We The People”. Also, one name, Putin, you know the Russian. Your Republican Special Counsel investigator Robert Mueller is working on that subject. Go Preds!
8232 2018-02-06 04:18:12 you know those "baked" versions of chips that have less oil and also are garbage. bet these will be similar
8233 2018-02-06 04:18:02 I beg to differ with you Mr. Pruitt. That is not the purpose of the EPA! By putting the fox in the hen house (weasel in your case) Trump goal is to pilfering our lands for his, the wealthy, big oil & coal corporate profit.  They care less about the immeasuable damage wrought!
8234 2018-02-06 04:17:59 The oil are playing for Adam tonight you can feel it and I’m hella proud of them

8236 2018-02-06 04:17:42 WD-40 is not a very lubricant it works but is not very good. better with motor oil or something close to that
8237 2018-02-06 04:17:26 For an Exxon exec, keeping Venezuelan oil off the market would be a big coup, I mean, uh, windfall
8238 2018-02-06 04:16:42 Its basically: when they were retained by an oil company and had to find a casus belli, it cobbled together raw data into a case.
8239 2018-02-06 04:16:34 I really want to learn how do an oil painting

8241 2018-02-06 04:16:21 Shocking to say the very least.The rot in the oil and gas industry in Nigeria sadly happens with the complete cooperation of Nigeria ruling elites.
8242 2018-02-06 04:16:14 Motor oil seems like lol
8243 2018-02-06 04:16:10 I had no idea that fossil fuel actually form from living organism and pressure which explains why we call that FOSSIL fuel. ( yeah feel a bit stupid about that! that was so obvious! ) #FossilFuels #Coal #Oil #NaturalGas
8244 2018-02-06 04:16:05 You have no idea how hard it is to keep all meals with little seasoning and no salt or oil when I’m cooking cus of the way I’m raining ivy
8245 2018-02-06 04:16:05 If there's anything surprising me, it's the relatively high correlations between distinct asset classes. I get the small oil sell off, but metals selling off doesn't make sense. One would assume bond yields would be lower too.
8246 2018-02-06 04:16:01 OILで...老いる！ｗｗｗｗｗ

8255 2018-02-06 04:15:10 There's a documentary that allegedly exposes the hypocrisy of the world’s largest environmental NGOs in attacking industries such as palm oil, for deforestation while steering clear of the biggest culprit of deforestation: animal agriculture.

8260 2018-02-06 04:14:18 Why do billionaires want to make the earth gross by drilling, spilling oil on land/sea, destroying nature, and denying climate change? Their money is meaningless when we’re all dead.
8261 2018-02-06 04:13:58 Once we no longer use fossil fuels that industry will not just die, since we need oil to make plastics which are ever growing in use.  And then will be good to see the stopping of the mauling of our landscape with horrible looking holes left after the extraction of coal and gas.
8262 2018-02-06 04:13:51 Sorry Russia & China will not allow that .so I guess after world war 3 .we won't have to worry about oil prices. Because nuke's leave one hell mess. Well I guess I'll start painting that bull's eye on my roof.

8275 2018-02-06 04:11:43 the secretary general ... should ask Maduro why it is that Venezuelans  people do not have any food or medicines as an oil exporter Country?
8276 2018-02-06 04:11:30 I feel like that’s so classic. One minute we are trying to help nature and everything in it, and the next, America wants more oil! Can’t we just leave the Act alone and focus on more important things?

8282 2018-02-06 04:10:35 Could they make palm oil free at the same time??
8283 2018-02-06 04:10:22 I’ve started making my pasta aglio e olio (olive oil and fried garlic with lemon and toppings) and I’m wondering why I ever used sauce before
8284 2018-02-06 04:10:21 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
8285 2018-02-06 04:10:15 i have a bunch of coconut oil in my eyes rn so i think now would be a great time to watch the new this is us episode so i can get it out

8287 2018-02-06 04:09:50 And he eas questioned by both houses of Congress and nothing was found. He spoke at a gas and oil summit in Russia after he quit the campaign.
8288 2018-02-06 04:09:48 I would blame the oil and gas industry for your job loss not me. I'm a stay at home mum. I fired the PCs for good reason. They were users. The NDP will be kicked out in the next election. They were a good broom to tidy the house of corruption. UCP better work out or we'll fire.

8292 2018-02-06 04:09:18 That coconut oil bath was so relaxing 
8293 2018-02-06 04:09:14 If the real costs of cleanup were factored into oil products nobody could afford them, even without taxes. The whole value proposition depends on taxpayers picking up those costs! The only reason fossil fuels have made a profit is those costs have been kicked down the road.
8294 2018-02-06 04:09:12 The oil bottle is 4oz, enough to last me about a week or so. Replace a coil every few months. So figure $40 to $50 a month using the vape, and it doesn't, you know, kill you! lol. Or $75 a week on cigs! + it kills you! lol. Worth a try!

8298 2018-02-06 04:08:38 The green groups are sure happy they’ve stopped energy east. They’ve got our own country buying foreign oil rather than buying oil from within their own country!

8302 2018-02-06 04:07:42 I love Sears Automotive Center because it's the one place I don't have to entertain anybody. The people there are immune to anything resembling charisma. Just bland people rotating tires. They've got some mute kid in there cleaning the oil bay. He don't care.

8313 2018-02-06 04:05:44 I really like this thing. @TheCasperVega you should give it a try. This little one i got was only $40, comes with a charger, and a extra coil. The coils do wear out after a while, but they are only $10 for a new one. The oil is $10 a bottle, with any flavor you could want.
8314 2018-02-06 04:05:43 No. Trump is the man responsible. Remember, “I told you, we’d win this,” Trump to GOP, acceptance speech.  He and his team are sure as hell complicit in conspiracy.  Trump’s history is the same - set people up, add the snake oil, glides past it.  Bullshit.  He’s guilty as hell.

8316 2018-02-06 04:05:25 Gas prices are up 40% over that last 12 months and heating oil up over 24%, so if you were lucky enough to actually get a tax break then you may be breaking even. Trump, Tillerson, Russia, No Coincidence...I Think
8317 2018-02-06 04:05:21 ごめん中にちょっと出ちゃった
8318 2018-02-06 04:05:20 Yep, the Bayou Bridge Pipeline, getting that Dakota oil to the coast!
8319 2018-02-06 04:05:18 Yep! And lemon and olive oil.
8320 2018-02-06 04:05:17 Wow. Literally, one of their motivations is that they will have more oil available to export.  And Donald is looking to drill in the Arctic and up and down both coasts. He is as uninformed as he is unimformable.

8327 2018-02-06 04:03:59 Cognitive dissonance. They have to believe that to be true otherwise they have to face the fact that they have supported a criminal & traitor who sold them snake oil. They’d literally have a mental breakdown if they were confronted with and accepted the truth before their eyes.

Tax reform. Development of public lands. Dependence on oil/coal. Repeal of Obamacare, Roe vs Wade, and DACA.

8346 2018-02-06 04:01:01 Wag maging bobo.. high prices because of increase of oil is minimal. If your car consume 45ltrs x 2php x 2/mo is minimal. The burden will be to the business & to those have cars. The goods will increase a bit but not high only those sugar and sin goods. What is the issue?

8351 2018-02-06 03:59:59 That statistic is misleading. The oil industry may only directly employ 150K Canadians, but the secondary and tertiary jobs it creates in manufacturing, finance, service, etc number many hundreds of thousands more across the country.
8352 2018-02-06 03:59:43 OMG, 5 days we have to listen to This? Can you go report what is really happening in America? Oil spills, Parks and MONUMENTS being destroyed, education being dismantled, farm prices plummeting. Stuff besides Trump.

8365 2018-02-06 03:57:05 And boca burgers cause they’re cheap, and I would put coconut oil in my coffee.
8366 2018-02-06 03:56:58 They just want to block Canadian oil so the US continues to get our oil for half of what it’s worth!

8368 2018-02-06 03:56:22 No measuring — chicken in a zip bag, add veg oil, Dijon, dried tarragon. Rub bag to coat, marinate 2 hours (min) — grill or bake. SO GOOD!!!
8369 2018-02-06 03:56:11 I could make out a little bit. Quaddaffi, weapons, oil and gas reserves, installing a permanent government, etc. Interested to hear thoughts on it. Stumbled across it yesterday looking for something else.
8370 2018-02-06 03:56:08 #BHM anthem for February is Vincent Staples “Bag Bak.” I feel black as hell, well lotioned with no ash in sight, anointed with coconut oil, and blessed by the fallen panthers who came before me. For the culture. 
8371 2018-02-06 03:55:56 If you have sinus problems, boil some water, drop a few oregano essential oil drops in it, cover the bowl and your head with a towel and breath it all in. It will totally clear your nose out . Again, it burns, but it works!

8373 2018-02-06 03:55:51 Snake oil and smoke & mirrors.
Charlatans all of them.
8374 2018-02-06 03:55:38 Yes it’s fine. If you’re using the oil from the ordinary they say use after water based products in regards to their line of serums and such. Which a lot of are water based.
8375 2018-02-06 03:55:15 I agree but for us it doesn’t solve our issue.  Alberta is landlocked. Selling  our oil at a discount of $31.70 per barrel hurts.
8376 2018-02-06 03:55:10 Lady Doritos are bad, but I'm more offended at the suggestion that regular Doritos are man food. Real men eat boulders and drink oil straight from the barrel.
8377 2018-02-06 03:55:05 True. I wasn't even thinking. But ion think that make you a hoe. Tho. If you got time invested in that girl. You checking everyone. Who you believe may had a part in that shh going down. Honestly

8392 2018-02-06 03:53:28 I usually take a little water shot with oregano essential oil, but I bought pills this time. Oregano kills any sickness you have! Like if you have strep, down some oregano ( burns like hell) and it kills all the bad germs.

8429 2018-02-06 03:48:59 No. They use palm oil. Husband sighs everytime I refuse to buy them.
8430 2018-02-06 03:48:54 ** *could make her some lysol* *only needs rubbing alcohol, vinegar, lavender oil, and water*
8431 2018-02-06 03:48:45 Sounds like a line from 'Back to the Future'. These guys had nothing else to do? 
"Dimethylpolysiloxane is used in fry oil to keep it from bubbling. They used the chemical to mass produce HFGs (Hair Follicle Germs), which were then transplanted into the bald mice’s backs."

8433 2018-02-06 03:48:41 Whether or not he had actual Russ gov./intel.ties, Page tried to present himself as someone who did. He was very eager to work for Gazprom, Russia's (& Putin's) Oil & Gas Co.

With access to next possible US Prez, wouldn't it have made sense to check his possible Russ intel ties?
8434 2018-02-06 03:48:38 I'm torn between the two videos and viewpoints on "oil sands", as the Canadian government labels them. I understand the negative environmental impacts, but I also know how many employees Suncor supports (my father's company works closely with Suncor)...#Lesson5
8435 2018-02-06 03:48:32 US oil producers hedged very well based on what I know. Those shale oil players will be happy to see this.
8436 2018-02-06 03:48:19 If the good people in Burnaby would start there civil disobedience right now, they could show the people of Vancouver what life looks like without oil. That might be an important object lesson. Enjoy!
8437 2018-02-06 03:48:14 There is/was a rumor that diabetes,cancer & Even AIDS cure is found but big pharma don't want to make it available. Like big oil, they have deep pockets & power centers working on their behest. We will never know the truth.
8438 2018-02-06 03:47:52 Loss of hair or diabetes? This is not an easy call, those fries are delightful.   One of my favorite food memories is sharing the first two baskets of fries out of fresh oil at McD’s with the crew.  Heavenly!
8439 2018-02-06 03:47:41 Another area where I suck at this whole thing. I should have looked into that a long time ago, always get told to do that. Instead I just use coconut oil because it works well and it's 1/100th the cost.
8440 2018-02-06 03:47:32 i put lavender in my oil diffuser but then i farted and let me tell you: bad combo
8441 2018-02-06 03:46:43 I don't mean to negate the solid effort the Oil have put in tonight, but Tampa sure looks like a team that looked past this game
8442 2018-02-06 03:46:41 Guess who just changed her own oil in her car tonight with my dad just talking me through suggestions. You are right, it’s me 
8443 2018-02-06 03:46:30 Yea they dont have oil glands like other birds and the softness of the feathers is what makes them so quiet when they fly
8444 2018-02-06 03:46:20 Not sure if I'm drunk or just got coconut oil in my eyes. 
8445 2018-02-06 03:46:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, yet the duty to stop it cold and she didn’t do it.
8446 2018-02-06 03:46:02 I have a lot of respect for your father and want to postpone his calling, both for himself and his country. We really need him now! Research has shown that Cannabis oil capsules can shrink tumors by cutting off the blood supply to the tumor. It has cured Neuroblastoma before.
8447 2018-02-06 03:45:58 This efficascent oil is really doing its job. Whoa.
8448 2018-02-06 03:45:49 @crash7800 I want this in 24x36 oil painting for over my bed
8449 2018-02-06 03:45:48 I know this is a joke but they actually make really good squalane oil
8450 2018-02-06 03:45:48 Are you arguing that although we can make plastic with "safer substances," companies are obstinately spending more just so they can use oil? That seems unlikely and makes me doubt your speculative claim.
8451 2018-02-06 03:45:47 腹上死(物理)だけ気を付けるえっちなやつ？？？？？？？
8452 2018-02-06 03:45:24 Thanks dad for teaching me the value of hard work, also for teaching me how to change the oil in my car
8453 2018-02-06 03:45:18 And oil changes gotta be done cause if you wait it’ll fuck your car up
8454 2018-02-06 03:45:14 acrylic, which is basic bitch baby paint, can cost 8 dollars a tube. and its insanely punishing if you mess up, compared to oil

sketching is clean and you can do it anywhere. super therapeutic.
8455 2018-02-06 03:45:06 Apache that oil tho  #QAnon
8456 2018-02-06 03:44:56 When did you ever hear about the gov choosing which oil companies get to do what project? They dont because it sells itself we take money from oil companies in royalties and taxes and give money to wind companies see the difference?
8457 2018-02-06 03:44:51 auto cannibalism exists so yes but not really bc your forehead oil isn't a body part (is this serious enough for you sara)
8458 2018-02-06 03:44:43 Are there any beard balm/oil companies that sponsor streamers? People tell me that I have a pretty great beard and I get asked what balm/oil I use all the time.  I would love to try out some products and pimp out the stuff I like
8459 2018-02-06 03:44:41 Me: “get the EXTRA virgin olive oil”
Max: *under breath* def not you...

Thanks...
8460 2018-02-06 03:44:40 A freaking army contractor? A blackwater? A wanta be military man dressed up as a special forces supporting Trump? Big surprise there. All wars should be paid for by the oil corporations that start them.
8461 2018-02-06 03:44:40 I just got stuck in my room for 5 minutes bc I covered myself in 2 much coconut oil and couldn't open the door
8462 2018-02-06 03:44:38 that box b slippery like trying to walk on oil
8463 2018-02-06 03:44:38 Today marks day 1 for using bio oil so I’m hoping it helps with my stretch marks i got from my pregnancy

8467 2018-02-06 03:44:09 Lately I’ve been putting baby oil in my towel with my soap when showering and omg 
8468 2018-02-06 03:44:02 Pro letting wanted criminal go+wanting thousands of regulations4 business+high taxes+think other countries oil is cleaner?Only works w media
8469 2018-02-06 03:43:44 Big Pharma aren't as potent as they claim inviting a potential of more use at higher quantities and higher dosages. Boys in Marketing spin hugely unethical lies. Reminds me a lot of "snake oil" Salesmen.
8470 2018-02-06 03:43:43 You just found my new header. god bless you and young oil, much love, goodnight
8471 2018-02-06 03:43:23 im gonna make apple fritters guys wish me luck vats of hot oil are scary to me

8475 2018-02-06 03:42:44 Question:

I use Micellar water (which contains oil) for face cleansing. My rose hip oil says to use after water based products. At risk of sounding stupid, can I use the rose hip oil after Micellar water? Will it be rendered ineffective?
8476 2018-02-06 03:42:43 Why was this important?  APACHE holds a majority in Mexico oil.  A vital US reserve.  There's much more to this than the first paragraph of an article.
8477 2018-02-06 03:42:41 so i found out about coconut oil and i've been saved.
8478 2018-02-06 03:42:39 COME ON RANDALL!!!!!!  Head scarf and coconut oil! Nothing like it
8479 2018-02-06 03:42:29 Thank you again@SethAbramson and keep burning that midnight oil.

8483 2018-02-06 03:42:02 I can save you! Use peppermint oil!
8484 2018-02-06 03:41:47 about lemon juice to preserve it...plenty of acid already in tomatoes especially heart ones like plum tomatoes... when we cook it directly into the pot...a touch of olive oil , garlic *salt black pepper... any lamb ..ribs...meatballs or veggies can be added...

8486 2018-02-06 03:41:22 if i used all the excess oil on my forehead to cook latkes, would it be a form of cannibalism? serious answers ONLY
8487 2018-02-06 03:41:19 try putting cbd oil in it
8488 2018-02-06 03:41:11 Pasta. Olive oil. Sprinkle of parmesan. Sauteed grape tomatoes. Yessirrr
8489 2018-02-06 03:40:55 Cool, and I presume some coconut oil, butter or lard or olive oil for cooking with?. Do you supplement? I’m thinking for example folic acid. Do you eat liver?
8490 2018-02-06 03:40:48 Currently shopping amazon for oil diffusers and lavender and weighted blankets. If that doesn’t tell you where my life is at currently

8492 2018-02-06 03:40:37 omg a fuckin' olive oil interest account liked the oil fucking tweet

8495 2018-02-06 03:40:10 サラダ油は野菜って言ったら変な顔されたよ。サラダってついてるのに本当に馬鹿だなあ。
8496 2018-02-06 03:40:06 Depends on how much money you're willing to spend, honestly. If you wanna go the cheap route, coconut oil or aloe Vera are great
8497 2018-02-06 03:40:00 Exxon-Mobil will save $6 billion/year because of new tax cut. They could afford 2 cover all of us with healthcare every year. But it goes 2 their already wealthy CEO & Board of Directors. Plus congress stopped oil rig safety & 9cents/ barrel disaster funding, like that would hurt
8498 2018-02-06 03:39:55 Crisco Oil shortage in Philadelphia this week .
8499 2018-02-06 03:39:29 I dried it out on some paper towels with a pan on top to help the water out for about an hour and a half. Then heated it in a pan (no oil) to try get the last of the water out, and then finally sautéed it in some olive oil.
8500 2018-02-06 03:39:12 This is the Oil I remember from last year. Where the fuck have they been for the last 4 months? #LetsGoOilers
8501 2018-02-06 03:38:58 you okay takpakai oil cleansing simple ni? dah lama dah teringin nak pakai, masa sale haritu taksempat nak grab 
8502 2018-02-06 03:38:43 I used way too much coconut oil again. But I don’t care tonight.
8503 2018-02-06 03:38:41 May your face get fried in its own oil 
8504 2018-02-06 03:38:37 I expect Tzeporah used her time as an insider to mine all the information she could use to thwart oil and gas even more
8505 2018-02-06 03:38:32 #Oil prices sink more than 1% amid global market plunge, U.S. output spree
8506 2018-02-06 03:38:30 @Comey his taxes that he won't release because of an audit, well release the audit letter that we all get from IRS. The oil deal that no one
8507 2018-02-06 03:38:18 That is so true Andrew I like what I'm hearing on 630 ched 4 to 1 for the Oil
8508 2018-02-06 03:38:08 Now to cut the springs, lower it so much, it will cave in the oil pan.

No, don't need to, it's a VW. It likely comes with a caved in oil pan...
8509 2018-02-06 03:38:04 は！？！！？えっちな？！！？えっちな？！
8510 2018-02-06 03:38:02 Trump is in with oil. Russia is in with oil big time.  (See my earlier article) They absolutely could have worked together to get Trump elected & judging from meeting with Don Jr they did work together ...that’s so illegal esp if Russia meddled in vote
8511 2018-02-06 03:37:59 put more brown sugar than you do coconut oil! otherwise the coconut oil will be too liquidy to keep the brown sugar on your face

8513 2018-02-06 03:37:53 When you get out a new roll of toilet paper, place a few drops of your favorite essential oil in the cardboard tube of the toilet paper.
8514 2018-02-06 03:37:49 Except for hormonal breakouts, coconut oil has pretty much cleared up my face and made it smooth
8515 2018-02-06 03:37:38 I just smeared garlic and avocado oil with some lemon juice & chili lime spice, put it on parchment paper, conventional bake at 425F x 20 minutes then  broiled for 5 minutes more until top is crispy.
8516 2018-02-06 03:37:30 I lost my money for my oil change
8517 2018-02-06 03:37:26 You likely have normal skin. But for the vast majority of people, coconut oil exacerbates their skin concerns. It scores a 4 out of 5 on the comedogenic scale making it highly likely to clog pores and cause breakouts.
8518 2018-02-06 03:37:14 oil change in less

8519 2018-02-06 03:37:07 Will there be any party called AAP after 2019? So better oil you own machine.
8520 2018-02-06 03:36:21 oh no! I'm so sorry. It sucks to live in pain. Since it became legal in CA I'm using cannabis oil 4 the degenerative arthritis & I've cut back on pain Rx by using edibles, I'm a convert! Its a miracle cure as far as I'm concerned. Should hold me over until I can get surgery.
8521 2018-02-06 03:36:12 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
8522 2018-02-06 03:36:01 Can i mix coconut oil with aquaphor?

8524 2018-02-06 03:35:29 @Comey Hello my friend,  I have a couple of questions. Has anyone looked into the estimated $520 Billion estimated oil deal with Russia and
8525 2018-02-06 03:35:27 Got my order today .... well some of it .... love the shea butter in our soaps ...glad we changed to the Shea instead of Palm oil....

8533 2018-02-06 03:34:13 Got my lab work done and my health is improving. It's definitely because I eliminated red meat and taking fish oil vitamins everyday.
8534 2018-02-06 03:33:55 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

8538 2018-02-06 03:33:43 Damn good question. Will cutting oil imports have a definite blow on the regime? How will Russia respond to it and what can the Chinese do to avoid the collapse of their wonder island? Key questions that Tillerson should answer before any actions can be taken.

8547 2018-02-06 03:32:56 Gas prices at the pump started rising.  Oil companies always has excuses for high gas prices when republicans in power.
8548 2018-02-06 03:32:53 Nope. Risk management now requires that companies pay for the damage they cause instead of treating the environment and the health of people as a commons. No more free rides. Plus, we can make all the plastic products we made with oil with safer substances at less cost.
8549 2018-02-06 03:32:47 How is it still a huge reveal on cooking shows that putting more things in the frying oil makes the oil temp go down. Come on guys, these rookie mistakes are annoying af.
8550 2018-02-06 03:32:26 .@Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
8551 2018-02-06 03:32:16 Thus far I'm seeing a sound defensive effort followed by active shooting. Pleasant seeing the Oil shut down and produce against the best team in the league.

8558 2018-02-06 03:31:21 Can't blame people for holding out. Oil, chemical companies do not have a good history for failures and with Trump lifting safety standards we are doomed to ruin the environment.

8561 2018-02-06 03:30:40 Tens of millions of citizens should DEMAND Big Oil pay for the transition to clean renewables &for the repair of the health of people & environment (due to pollution)& its contribution to climate change. They profited unfairly from Earth's resources that belong to ALL Earthlings.

Dirt, oil, and pollution are among the common things that stick to it when we go on with our day.

These contribute to acne, skin damage, and wrinkles. Use mild skin care products to help prevent against these.

8675 2018-02-06 03:14:16 You're delusional. With directional drilling, fracking and shale oil the U.S. will lead the world in oil production at some point.

8676 2018-02-06 03:13:51 We have natural resources here you dumb ass. Our economy depends on Oil and pulling stuff out of the ground like coal, potash, uranium etc. What does Quebec and Ontario offer Canada? What kind of Carbon Tax does Ford and Bombardier pay with our bail out money?

8695 2018-02-06 03:12:06 The biggest reason for Carter's poor economy was stagflation brought on by high government spending and the fed raising interest rates during an economic downturn (also oil scarcity). The economy is doing well right now, so the rate hikes were justified.
8696 2018-02-06 03:12:03 Almost none.  It popped up when I was doing something else. One guy that had sent me a similar document said the site wasn't good. I did read all the links.  The DOJ link is the right place.  And I guess it depends on if he's really in the oil biz...

8714 2018-02-06 03:09:02 It changes the consistency to like Jamaican black castor oil.. and lays all fly away hairs without it looking like you used edge control. You literally need a pinch.. rub it in your hands and just lay it down.
8715 2018-02-06 03:09:01 As for the oil being worth hee haw you have to blame the management. UK is only country in the world where BP & SHELL don't pay tax FACT Is there no a wee part of ye that says hing on a f'ing mo if they can do that on the pittance we "give" them how the F can our govt not do that
8716 2018-02-06 03:09:00 Shrimp - two swirls of olive oil in a pan, a teaspoon of red chilli flakes, salt and pepper, 2-3 crushed cloves of garlic, heat oil on low-med heat until garlic just turns golden, throw raw blue shrimp in and remove from heat when pink.
8717 2018-02-06 03:08:23 I just put baby oil with coconut on my insanely dry skin and you know how at the aquarium they have the touch pool with stingrays and they’re soft and slippery? That’s how my legs feel. I can’t stop touching them

8719 2018-02-06 03:08:14 I hate when vegetables are cooked with too much butter/oil.. that's defeating the purpose
8720 2018-02-06 03:08:14 Oil and gas is terrible for human health/environment. Try solar, hydro, thermal, wind, nuclear energy and many other ways that are cleaner and safer than gas and oil. The problem is not only scarcity and dependence of foreign oils/gas but air pollution endangering our health. =/

8727 2018-02-06 03:07:39 You are screwing the environment for short term profits for big oil. Alternative energy employs more people in the US than fossil fuel, but they give Trump PAC $. If you were any dumber you’d be a moron.

8739 2018-02-06 03:06:22 @CNN   You know, some people really think the fake news you tell is really the truth.  You should try selling snake oil!!!  Suckers born everyday and the morons are watching CNN.

8744 2018-02-06 03:05:34 Are we gonna funnel the oil into a milk?

8751 2018-02-06 03:04:56 The Koch brothers are driving the Republicans - paying for votes and obvious bonus of 500k to Paul Ryan.  They want us back on coal and oil, and don’t believe in global warming.  Sound like Trump?  #TheResistance
8752 2018-02-06 03:04:54 Palm oil! Shouldn’t be eating them anyway....

8764 2018-02-06 03:02:34 I gave chronic migraines & am very sensitive to smells. Exhaust fumes are the worst as well as perfumes.  I carry a peppermint oil stick with me wherever I go to run beneath my nose.
8765 2018-02-06 03:02:29 Let me massage ya scalp @AugustAlsina We got the best coconut oil out here Trinidad.
8766 2018-02-06 03:02:24 Hitting the debt ceiling sooner than expected because of #TaxScam & 6 million gift to oil companies, let’s not forget about golf weekends. Go figure, you know that’s a loan Donald? One the American people have to pay back right, because people do that in reality!
8767 2018-02-06 03:02:12 When the world goes to bed tonight, somewhere there’ll be a filmmaker burning the midnight oil to start his career. Tonight, that will be me. Toiling away on projects I will work hard to make happen.
8768 2018-02-06 03:02:03 New strategy--Pretend oil protests, rights marches, etc are super bowl celebrations.

8771 2018-02-06 03:01:49 Also, once and for all, could someone please note that an accident would not be an oil spill, but a bitumen-condensate spill, which is virtually irreversible? 2010 Kalamazoo spill is still not cleaned up, and that was in a river, not the ocean. Get facts straight please!
8772 2018-02-06 03:01:41 Gonna try putting castor oil on the roots of my lashes, let’s see if it really makes them fuller and longer
8773 2018-02-06 03:01:41 The big V and the big K episode show the importance of common sense in investing - reading AR and spinning stories in your web can be a chimera if not validated against what's possible in real life. Snake Oil always looks an elixir until its not.
8774 2018-02-06 03:01:34 this oil & belly rub smells SO good
8775 2018-02-06 03:01:34 Heads up big oil: John Nash told us if we want to pursue our personal greatest good, we should first consider the greatest good for the group. That means you'd maximize your profits if you GAVE A SHIT ABOUT SOCIETY and the ENVIRONMENT. Just sayin'. #prisonersdilemma #gametheory

Please give me money!
8779 2018-02-06 03:01:06 It’s changed, I think they’re being kind to the palm oil now. Either that or they just got privy to the bad rep they were getting and changed to accommodate.
8780 2018-02-06 03:01:01 This is it:  1 3/4 c flour,1 3/4 c sugar,1 tea soda 1/2 tea salt,(Mix dry ingredients in second)   2 lg bananas or 3 small,2 eggs,1/2 c veg. Oil,1/4 c & 1tbs buttermilk,1 tea vanilla...1 cup crushed walnuts.Stir until combined  bake:325 1 hr & 15 min...Don't Double !

8785 2018-02-06 03:00:41 It wasn't at the convention It's been growing for a decade or more.  Russia had lots of oil money to spend bribing politicians and GOP had the "anti commie" cover so they dived right in
8786 2018-02-06 03:00:35 love too come home to a pan sitting in a puddle of oil on the adjacent burner cover thus making two surfaces dangerous instead of only one, or none!

8799 2018-02-06 02:58:43 Yeah I use the Trader Joe’s olive oil spray. Still olive oil but you don’t use nearly as much!
8800 2018-02-06 02:58:39 やることなさ過ぎてジュース飲み続けることしかできない
8801 2018-02-06 02:58:02 Those covering markets knew correction was coming & it is, as it always does. Trumpers sold snake oil to its base. Can’t cut taxes, use debt to pay for it, and think it won’t eventually rear its ugly head. Grow economy methodically — not w greed/vanity that leads to a crash.
8802 2018-02-06 02:58:00 some foods (high octane) other foods like thick sludge oil. #SHAPEHealthEd
8803 2018-02-06 02:57:56 Silly. It wasn't that much and not every place has a small population and buckets of oil. Other places will have to take it from the workers and owners in the productive economy. Stunting it's ability to add jobs value added and pay taxes.
8804 2018-02-06 02:57:54 For all of my friends out there. What are your thoughts on fish oil?

8806 2018-02-06 02:57:23 This is why I live in Texas. If things get too bad, we have our own power grid, our own oil, & we don't need no stinkin federal reserve. We'll just build our own walls & bail outta the craziness.

8831 2018-02-06 02:53:55 Make no mistake oil/gas drilling by ExxonMobil in the Artic is Putins' favorite because it's about $500Billion in profit!! 1/2 $ TRILLION DOLLARS!! BUT, need to get rid of that Magnitsky Act to make that happen! Bet Putin was wishing he hadn't had him beaten to death in jail now
8832 2018-02-06 02:53:47 i got added to a group dm today where one person was insistent we watch this youtube video about the potential for mushrooms to clean up oil spills or something. julian assange was tagged in.
8833 2018-02-06 02:53:45 Depends on how strict you want to be. Bacon and eggs are great though I rarely eat breakfast. Leafy greens, oil/cream dressing. Meat, nuts (marcona almonds are a go-to), cheese. Broccoli, cauliflower, anything with low net carbs.
8834 2018-02-06 02:53:24 and we need cars that do not need gasoline and we have the technology to do without oil.
8835 2018-02-06 02:53:00 Really glad oil prices are going up because I really miss getting overpaid for doing the dumbest shit.
8836 2018-02-06 02:52:58 Olive oil floats in water because it is less dense. Anvils are *much* more dense than water.
Gravity doesn’t cause orbit; momentum does (it pushes things to the side while gravity draws it in).
Gravity pulls water (and everything else) towards its center point from all angles...

8838 2018-02-06 02:52:52 Ah, this reminds me of how stressful this level was for me. Constantly drowning in the oil
8839 2018-02-06 02:52:40 Well that was a miniature episode of If You Give a Mouse a Cookie for me

 Wanted to go on a walk, ended up driving all over town to find the right oil for my car engine.
8840 2018-02-06 02:52:38 Lol this shit crazy.  It happened right after it sent me an alert that maintenance due now.  Like FIRST OF ALL, how you know what my oil on?!
8841 2018-02-06 02:52:19 Hes a Russian spy too? 

Why would a socialist President want a Capitalist Republican to win?
Why would Putin who is totally dependant on Russian Oil Exports for up to 50% of govt revenues, want Trump who wants to expand US oil production to its maximum?

YOU ARE BEING LIED TO.
8842 2018-02-06 02:52:19 it’s so cold in my apartment that my ghee oil — which i specifically bought to combat the melting of ghee — is mostly solid.

8848 2018-02-06 02:51:35 You know what? Someone in Silver Lake could probably make a decent living being an artistinal snake oil salesman.
8849 2018-02-06 02:51:34 Because this makes sense? Trump will just double the tariffs on Canadian oil & shut our border down leaving us about $500B a year in the red and heaven forbid that Trudeau may actually have to reduce his foreign money addiction and globalist handouts! @Potus call Trudeau’s bluff!
8850 2018-02-06 02:51:31 But the wealthy corporations are people too and need help they might not be able to pay for their third house.. and oil companies still receive subsidies but god forbid a solar company gets one

8852 2018-02-06 02:51:02 1) Letting companies or people keep more of their own money is not a gift. It is reduced extortion.
2) A general tax cut is hardly a measure designed to specifically benefit oil companies.

8856 2018-02-06 02:50:42 Here's our difference: I can find flaws in "my" candidate/positions. Obama promised to close gitmo: he didn't. He promised to restore our coastline oil spill: he didn't. He said you could choose your own doctor. Wrong. You can't find anything wrong w Trump. U r a cult member.

8858 2018-02-06 02:50:23 You run a 12 billion NET surplus from Canada with NAFTA, 12 billion goods deficit is erased by the 24 billion service surplus.

If you don't want a goods deficit buy less oil & enjoy $4.50 per gallon gas. It's simple.

8868 2018-02-06 02:49:09 Trump appointed Rex Tillerson as Sec. of State, and he had never MET him.  This is key. Tillerson had been CEO of ExxonMobil and as a businessman had done a huge oil deal with Putin. He was given an award by Putin. Obama's sanctions stopped billion dollar oil deal from happening.
8869 2018-02-06 02:49:09 Had the war criminals Bush/Cheney et ali not invaded Iraq, the world and especially the ME would be far more peaceful and cooperative. But they chose to throw away goodwill and friendship in favor of an asshole's agenda and oil they thought could be had for free.

9015 2018-02-06 02:28:28 They’re literally legalizing selling snake oil.
9016 2018-02-06 02:28:26 Oil prices are set to close out the year somewhere around 15 percent up, and the oil market looks more stable than it has in years. But what does 2018 have in store?Most analysts believe more of the same  inventory declines, some shale growth, a gradual increase in the oil price

9025 2018-02-06 02:26:50 Your narrative concerns oil prices; it has nothing to do with Chavez and what he did for his people. It's up to you to demonstrate how he didn't make Venezuela better don't you think?
9026 2018-02-06 02:26:48 This is true. They had to use hydraulic oil because it's water resistant. The Crisco washed off.

9032 2018-02-06 02:26:19 On the other hand, oil companies got huge windfalls from tax breaks besides their usual corporate subsidies, (gov. welfare), and the price of gas is still on the rise.
9033 2018-02-06 02:26:18 Bro how you Jamaican and never had fish oil. But it works, I have been taking it for years. I recommend it

9062 2018-02-06 02:22:31 Was Sekera reading our thread? He's flying tonight!
9063 2018-02-06 02:22:08 the Republican tax scam Exxon Mobil Oil Company received a six billion dollar tax cut, that's just one company. And in other news Steve mnuchin told Congress they needed to raise the debt ceiling right away
9064 2018-02-06 02:22:02 Many Canadians think it's possible to have a good quality of life in this country without building more pipelines and expanding the pace of oil sands production
9065 2018-02-06 02:22:00 Coconut oil really does solve all of life's problems
9066 2018-02-06 02:21:58 they would rather pay more to Saudis any day than give over any of altas equalization for oil back to alta.
9067 2018-02-06 02:21:40 Yup! It’s him.  Same old plaid suit wearing, snake oil, 1979 used car salesman he’s always been.
9068 2018-02-06 02:21:38 Nope. You are taking other risk that govt may ask to share subsidies plus, the oil prices can move haywire if Market has to turn. NTPC and other has no market influence from business point of view. Hence dividends are stable
9069 2018-02-06 02:21:27 Also am gonna have to make sure the man is warned before he gets in because there’s hella conditioner and body oil in there on the floor lol
9070 2018-02-06 02:21:24 Instead of saying some remark, he tensed under the other's touch. Exhaling slowly, he forced himself to relax some. It felt nice, but it was odd at the same time; he never had anyone see this much skin from him, let alone oil it up and massage it all.

He couldn't complain too -

9077 2018-02-06 02:19:25 All good but how are you going to afford to subsidize your important projects and programs if we don’t get some revenue from offshore oil and LNG royalties? Your ideas are good but you don’t understand that we need money to implement change.
9078 2018-02-06 02:19:22 Corporations need to find a substitute for Palm oil & stop the devastation. They have plenty of damn money now with tax breaks given to them.
9079 2018-02-06 02:19:22 I’m glad that CBD oil is legal everywhere now, because that is magic for idiopathic head tremors for my Neko.

9081 2018-02-06 02:19:15 CBD and Hemp oil come from plant- former from leaves, roots, stalk and stem while latter from seeds- THC and CBD are two primary compounds found in Cannabis family plants
9082 2018-02-06 02:19:14 So then. This means, America and the Industrial War Machine have secured the oil fields and how and to whom it is delivered? That's what I read. Never-mind me.

9132 2018-02-06 02:11:36 I’m trying to teach husband how to count calories and he just said that you don’t have to count all of the olive oil in the salad dressing we make bc most of it seeps to the bottom  No, it doesn’t. And yes, you do.
9133 2018-02-06 02:11:34 my hair so moisturized , its scary  jamaican black castor oil saves lives .
9134 2018-02-06 02:11:22 are you suggesting refined oil products we 'enjoy' (actually, forced to use due to few alternatives)  are the same as dilbit?
9135 2018-02-06 02:11:16 A roller heated to 320 degrees melts the asphalt so it sticks to the fiberglass. Then they add either canola or sunflower oil.
9136 2018-02-06 02:11:09 We got that letter a few months ago and I freaked out too. Tie up hair, you can shampoo w Tea Tree Oil, which I hear they hate. Other than that cross your fingers and treat w lice shampoo as needed. Good luck..

9152 2018-02-06 02:10:11 @AC360  AndesonCooper never talks about the Regulations Trump  brags he's cutting we needed to protect workers from getting hurt or ripped off,  or preventing things like BP oil spill. even a repeat of Banks investments like 2008 crash. No one is  checking.  Pray for us.
9153 2018-02-06 02:09:56 nah i like my fries plain actually. LUL but they were so good. just bought two good sized sweet potatoes cut them up and put some olive oil on them then salt and pepper. ugh so good.
9154 2018-02-06 02:09:50 @SpeakerRyan 
Brags that the tax plan increases a school secretary’s  paycheck (biweekly?)$1.50 
Did he mention Exxon oil gets an increase of $8 Billion? No? Y do u that is?
Is it that $8 Billion 2 a RICH business we already SUBSIDIZE & many Sen. Hi Cruz have shares in, is INSANE

9172 2018-02-06 02:07:01 Yes I agree with you, but when that bubble blows it will be good for sentiment.  It is a sentiment stock, even tho not a formidable threat, it still hampers the sentiment.  Having $TSLA blown out of the water for misleading and falsehoods will bring good vibrations back to oil.

9192 2018-02-06 02:04:33 So did people elect Trump to allow bankers, lenders, and oil companies to recreat all the disasters of the past 10 years? Just wondering if this was in his campaign promises - more oil spills, more deceptive lending, more mortgage meltdowns!!

9270 2018-02-06 01:54:11 Castor oil, coconut oil, palm kernel oil and vitamin E oil. The kernal oil doesnt have the most pleasant scent and castor oil makes my scalp itch but its really good!
9271 2018-02-06 01:54:05 Measure eight liters of olive oil then put back on heat.
9272 2018-02-06 01:53:52 They don't gst it Katy. Workers are the machine of wealth. They gave workers an oil change and big wheels got a new jet.
9273 2018-02-06 01:53:44 Some ribs and oven baked potatoes with ranch season and oil. Pretty good supper tonight. #yum
9274 2018-02-06 01:53:39 We should be applauding the increasing efficiency of the oil and gas sector, and preparing for a future where this is the norm.
9275 2018-02-06 01:52:54 I forgot MCT oil too. Supposed to burn fat.
9276 2018-02-06 01:52:44 Lol aite. This what y'all ought to do. I think Convent have opening for Nuns. If u bathe in Olive Oil and Shak Shak Bush you're a born again virgin. Stop sex. Do the work. Enjoy convent 
9277 2018-02-06 01:52:39 Amit shah wants everyone to eat pakora and be fat like him. If u have health issues they have given 5 lac per family health insurance.

9278 2018-02-06 01:52:13 I’ve put olive oil in curly hair and it worked really well
9279 2018-02-06 01:52:01 ここでKnightsもう一曲やるのかと思ってめちゃくちゃ浮かれてしまったけど、違ったwwwwwwwwwwww
9280 2018-02-06 01:51:43 No, but to oil refineries, chemical manufacturers. Should we do absolutely nothing?
9281 2018-02-06 01:51:25 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
9282 2018-02-06 01:51:19 Brent fell by 1.5$ today and light sweet/ West Texas intermediate by 2 $. Follow @tonyseba if you really want to know about the future of oil
9283 2018-02-06 01:51:10 Sigh I can’t even smoke oil because there’s a lot of risk factors and shit since i can’t go to an actual dispensary for it. Sigh
9284 2018-02-06 01:51:07 Not a chance unless current Oil Sands Environmental Damage is cleaned up first & the Dirty Tar is Refined in Alberta before shipping anywhere by any means.
9285 2018-02-06 01:50:58 Love is so great why are we wasting time w oil n shit when we could have enough love power the planet forever
9286 2018-02-06 01:50:48 you've been sold snake oil, and you can't get enough
9287 2018-02-06 01:50:39 Nothing but starchy carbs cooked in GMO corn oil. But hey you'll die early with a full head of hair.

9294 2018-02-06 01:49:58 Did someone put cartoon oil on the ice???? Why is everyone falling down so much??
9295 2018-02-06 01:49:49 It won't be when the United States runs out of oil.
9296 2018-02-06 01:49:42 Home in Wetaskiwin! Lets Go Oil!!
9297 2018-02-06 01:49:31 Of course, but by ownership, you need oil money or Amazon money. You need Apple money or AI money. That's what it takes these days. Good luck to you. FFP trying to keep clubs like West Ham down as well.
9298 2018-02-06 01:49:28 We need to find the oil wizard and beat him up till he releases us from the curse, the damn nerd. No deep clean cream keeps it away for more than 40 mins
9299 2018-02-06 01:49:25 Facts. Let be rub oil on yo head boy!
9300 2018-02-06 01:49:25 As if you would know about facts. People are keeping more of their money. It doesn't go to bonds or oil.
9301 2018-02-06 01:49:22 I had to make churros three times for Spanish class, I’ve successfully burnt myself by the oil three times 
9302 2018-02-06 01:49:06 油を英訳するとオイル、オイルを和訳すると油。友達です。  @ABURA_elf
9303 2018-02-06 01:48:56 ありがとう教授！！
9304 2018-02-06 01:48:26 教授の質問、発表者のレベルに合わせて変えてるし俺への質問めっちゃ気を使ってくれてたんだなぁ…
9305 2018-02-06 01:48:05 Watching forensic files enjoying infomercials for a flashlight you can dip in boiling oil called Tank Torch or some shit
9306 2018-02-06 01:47:39 If there was demand and refining capacity the existing KM pipe would be shipping to China. It's not. This oil is bound for the US not Asia
9307 2018-02-06 01:47:37 Now we can put our extra $20 a week in our gas tanks since the @realDonaldTrump admin jacked oil prices back up. Right to the oil companies and then into Tillerson and Trump's pockets through payoffs.
9308 2018-02-06 01:47:33 I always smile when academic lefties and environmental extremists talk about being more like Norway... one of the wealthiest oil countries in the world.
9309 2018-02-06 01:47:24 โอ๊ยผู้กู รักกันขนาดไหน ฮืออออ
9310 2018-02-06 01:47:20 Kevin hart had that oil on em 
9311 2018-02-06 01:46:58 OK
9312 2018-02-06 01:46:49 Why should the Democrats be worried about offshore drilling you have enough regulations put in place. I want lower gas prices add more oil on the market if that means more drilling go for
9313 2018-02-06 01:46:48 아침부터 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 빵 터지고 가요 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

教授の言ってることは一つもわかんないよ！教授の良いって言ってることは何がいいのかわかんないよ！
わかんない！私にはわかんないの！
初心者質問って何なの？初心者なんて嘘だよ！煽ってるだけだよ！教授のどこが初心者なの？
9315 2018-02-06 01:46:45 I’ve been back and forth on it, then Gordan Ramsey confirmed oil in the water. Also need to get the water to a rolling boil.
9316 2018-02-06 01:46:45 So frying dumplings is a lot harder than @WesA1983 made it look. Imagine fireworks......of oil. Now the kitchen is coated in a thin sheen. #unfortunate #lessonlearned #takeawayisbetter
9317 2018-02-06 01:46:43 Why kind of bs is that??? $80 for an oil change wow
9318 2018-02-06 01:46:36 A better solution would be to lobby for small solar cells to be implemented on all buildings and to get tax cuts/subsidies to install on existing homes. Solar is far cheaper than the horrendous cost for oil exploring/drilling/exporting.
9319 2018-02-06 01:46:23 Cancerous food additives to avoid: 905 & 905 a,b,c Paraffin & Vaseline, White Mineral Oil (Solvents, Coating, Glazing, Chewing Gums)
9320 2018-02-06 01:46:22 Can’t stand wen I’m trying a new oil or spray for my hair and it breaks out my face 
9321 2018-02-06 01:46:20 So, Gist I heard from Portharcourt oh. That age is nothing for dating. The 28 year olds oil company workers date ladies older than them. Wow!! Nigeria is changing. And the women are proud. I miss Portharcourt oh. Wish I can go back
9322 2018-02-06 01:45:57 Hm, pretty sure he was #1 period in '03/04 and sucked at .905 in the playoffs. '05/06 #1 again w/ 51 GP and dies at .884 vs. Oil in rd. 1. Sorry, he had his shot and blew it. Other seasons no way the #RedWings are choosing him over Hasek, CuJo or Osgood (after those two Cups).
9323 2018-02-06 01:45:49 Slither whenever . I’ll give you an oil change while I’m doin ya hair 
9324 2018-02-06 01:45:44 I don’t get the contradiction; we promote oil pipelines but a carbon tax to reduce emissions. does right hand know what left hand is doing?
9325 2018-02-06 01:45:33 Castor oil worked better for me! Just apply it with a Q tip or a spoolie and leave it over night (:
9326 2018-02-06 01:45:32 Buddy ask me how I keep from having sex with guys? Coconut oil and Self pleasure.

9329 2018-02-06 01:45:10 Than snuggle up by the fire with some nice car hot chocolate  (oil )
9330 2018-02-06 01:45:00 For those who think that drilling for oil will benefit you locally, it won’t. The oil/gas that could be found won’t stay & be processed for Washingtonians. It’ll be exported away. But you’ll be left with the horrible environmental impacts.
9331 2018-02-06 01:45:00 つえー！！
9332 2018-02-06 01:44:56 oh no only the rallies are due to obama. the drops are all trump's fault. everyone knows that.

9335 2018-02-06 01:44:43 Oil companies are laying off workers, and some may default on their debt. High yield bond funds haven't done well as a result.  

Why don't you talk about this?
9336 2018-02-06 01:44:41 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 날씨에 현타오심 ㅋㅋㅋ
9337 2018-02-06 01:44:37 ですね〜！お互い気をつけましょう！

9339 2018-02-06 01:44:11 one of these places is an oil town that mostly burned down two years ago, so I suspect shenanigans
9340 2018-02-06 01:44:00 Thing is the oil would have to travel too far this way to get to Asia the BC port is closer since it is already on the Pacific Rim making Asia much closer and the oil cheaper to ship
9341 2018-02-06 01:43:53 Girls Basketball Final: Oil City 60, Titusville 30.
9342 2018-02-06 01:43:50 LOL literally me with the fat bombs!! Coconut oil is life  how are you liking Keto so far? Did you get the “Keto flu”?

9361 2018-02-06 01:41:55 Apache is oil co. Rothchild selling shares
9362 2018-02-06 01:41:48 The problem is the source of this information comes from Wall Street & I remember when they continued to inflate oil prices while demand was dropping. They went on the news continously to promote their lies until they made enough money after that the bottom fell out.
9363 2018-02-06 01:41:39 Go Go Gadget Oil Slick lol

9367 2018-02-06 01:41:20 Tires are just stupidly expensive. And last week I did oil change and had to do all the rotation, filter change yadda yadda and all of a sudden, my bill was an easy triple digits...

9375 2018-02-06 01:39:52 Trump: I don't know nothin' about that. Oh! I was in the Olive Oil business with his father but that was a long time ago. That's all.
9376 2018-02-06 01:39:48 You’re not supposed to put oil in the water. Just salt.
9377 2018-02-06 01:39:36 @KVUE what spilled  milk, beer , oil, poison ,
9378 2018-02-06 01:39:35 And her hair is pretty. Nothing a consistent routine of Jamaican Black castor oil couldn’t cure.

9380 2018-02-06 01:39:13 Depends on age of them. They have to be replaced in pairs because they changed them. Easy way to see if they are blown. When you take them off oil just keeps coming out of them.

9386 2018-02-06 01:38:41 Yeah love it’s called Oil pull. It’s amazing.
9387 2018-02-06 01:38:37 Does anyone seriously think this guy’s argument has a scintilla of merit?  It’s as big a joke as the press that gives this snake oil salesman airtime.

9413 2018-02-06 01:34:57 That's great, I get oil is heart of AB economy. But this in your face attitude shows you don't get the concern about climate change & GHGs.
9414 2018-02-06 01:34:50 Both. Being in government changes your opinion on what is actually critical to the provinces survival and just how much money is lost to the lack of transport for Oil. She also had the bad luck of taking control of the province in a very bad economic cycle so she knows.
9415 2018-02-06 01:34:39 I just wanna thank @HeyFranHey for promoting avocado oil a few weeks back. I been telling niggas it works 
9416 2018-02-06 01:34:36 So it was doubly amusing to be reminded of his “Silicon Snake Oil” phase, just 5 years later.

9428 2018-02-06 01:32:59 re: gold oil high correlation...

Trudeau is in favour of TPP, sells arms to Saudi Arabia, is implementing multiple oil pipelines, is against universal pharmacare, free post secondary, and electoral reform. Last but not least he is apart of Canada's centrist party.

9664 2018-02-06 01:06:21 Perhaps @BBCDouglasF can confirm an Indy Scot could break all UK contracts and make similar revenues to Norway within a few years for citizens instead of the profits going to third parties. 7b a year and UK has produced more oil than Norway. So that figure is on LOW side.

9699 2018-02-06 01:01:32 Haha mama found a new way to make her child sleepy *pats my own back* 

Slowly combing her hair and rubbing coconut oil in to her scalp, then braiding it, relaxes her so much that she asked if she can go to bed early ! 

Score one for mama !

9794 2018-02-06 00:44:31 Sure, and that should also be taxed. There are of course environmental costs around producing oil as well. The advantage of electric cars is that they use batteries, while gas cars have their own power plants.

9840 2018-02-06 00:37:20 Thanks. I live in Sanford, so this caught my eye. What a scary article! I remember when I was a kid (80s) hearing my dad say that one day watet will overtake oil as the world's biggest commodity. Looks like a good chance he's correct. Yikes!
9841 2018-02-06 00:37:06 If Horgan blinks he loses his govt but then BC will get even larger Green caucus that will have leverage to stop #fracking, #coal export, LNG & #SiteC.

Software & other tech corps are fleeing US & Trump so prospects for urban BC are great. As long as there is NEVER an oil spill.

9844 2018-02-06 00:36:54 Don't listen to the detractors Governor Fallin.  You ran on a platform 8 years ago and stuck to it the best you can.  Not your fault oil and gas industry busted.  It happens.  Oklahoma will be fine.  Thanks for your service.
9845 2018-02-06 00:36:43 What's worse short term... oil in the Fraser river from a derailed train or some more co2?

9853 2018-02-06 00:35:26 I agree that reduction of pollution is important. Already said that. No way is oil use going away though.

but it works so i gotta endure that sighhh
9857 2018-02-06 00:34:48 Blinded much. But, go ahead, open your pockets to the snake oil salesman, he makes no secret of it.
9858 2018-02-06 00:34:41 It’s a global sell-off due to rising interest rates, higher oil prices, and lagging demand.   The recent increased reliance on debt from the US is accelerating the correction.  Would be really worried if it continued into another day.
9859 2018-02-06 00:34:35 @StateDept @washingtonpost @nytimes The necessary oil sanctions are sighted in Venezuela. Despite the bankruptcy of PDVSA, the international community knows that the so-called exports only serve to launder money from drug trafficking, to feed corrupt and to finance terrorism.

9864 2018-02-06 00:34:07 I believe al gore used it for social and political gain and made it an “us vs. them” situation and is probably half the reason it’s still an argument. If he hadn’t done that it would have been big oil vs. the world instead of Reps vs. Dems. That’s what I think.

9872 2018-02-06 00:33:19 To what degree is that saved oil offset by burnt coal, on a per CO2-ton basis?
9873 2018-02-06 00:33:03 Why is it hard for you to understand?The oil companies I mentioned are the pioneers& World leaders of oil exploration. They don't grab the territories they explored & drill. They don't tell them where to fish. They allow world's shipping to pass thru their exploration concession.
9874 2018-02-06 00:32:37 The cost of pollution is pretty simple to figure out. It's the cost of making sure that pollution is not produced. So, if coal and oil can be used without producing pollution cheaper than alternatives, power to them. So you're taxing companies on their pollution output.
9875 2018-02-06 00:32:34 Over Medium heat.  Dredge chicken in GF flour, and place in the pot once the oil is shimmering hot.  Cook for 5 minutes, then turn over.  Cook for another 5 min.  Voila, fried chicken to beat anything fast foodish.

9879 2018-02-06 00:31:47 So that’s something that I think was overstated. 
I think it’s closer to the 90’s oil crisis we had with Iran that started Desert Storm.
Sure everyone’s scared, but it’s a foreign war and that won’t stop a going away party from happening.
9880 2018-02-06 00:31:40 Obama & Clinton wanted war with Syria, overthrow their government and install a puppet government so the globalists can build oil pipelines through that country from other oil producing countries in the middle east to the Mediterranean Sea.  It's all about oil wealth.

Expressed my excitement & asked him to ship 50,000 liters. 
He asked "You think this is a joke"? 
Yes but you started it.

9894 2018-02-06 00:30:22 Joe, the bond vigilantes are testing growth. Spiking yields. Crude oil has rallied signalling inflation...but do actually have global growth and are our deficits shrinking? Stocks101.

9901 2018-02-06 00:29:30 If oil now tumbles, nobody will take DowJones Massacre as the underlying fundamental. However, as my grandmother (like all Dutch grannies) stated "you can only spend your dollar once", so a sell off in oil futures is expected.  No change fundamentals or overrated shale oil #OOTT

9905 2018-02-06 00:29:04 The movies this month have all won Academy Awards, but his movie's award was a political contribution. So its presence is a fraud, as is the theme of the movie itself. Gore's family made money off oil and politics; then Al switched to fear of a fraud.

9929 2018-02-06 00:24:54 Because when the IRGC falls, the Syria Regime falls, then IS will triple and the US will have no access to Kirkuk oil.

9949 2018-02-06 00:21:53 What of the Canadian border? Or the coastlines? Are you thinking that oil drilling will serve as a deterrent for undocumented workers to enter this country? Our tourism industry is failing, and the solar industry is being decimated because of your weak leadership. You kill jobs.

9951 2018-02-06 00:21:45 Here is what your conservative bullshit web-site says.

9973 2018-02-06 00:19:40 He is a master at stretching the line but not breaking it. The more he destabilizes us, the more he can distract his own people from the fact that his entire nation is dependent on $80+ per barrel oil. RU needed to diversify much more then they did. He doesn't know how.

Me: Shut up you Norwegian oil bitch
9982 2018-02-06 00:19:15 Doesn't matter how many people you can fit in the Han Van. If you don't take time to change the oil and let it cool down, no one goes anywhere ;)

9988 2018-02-06 00:18:12 I don't have a problem with ending subsidies to oil companies. Then again we shouldn't be subsidizing ethanol, wind and solar. Teslas tax breaks are off the charts.
9989 2018-02-06 00:18:08 An oil change.
9990 2018-02-06 00:18:02 Roll up a fatty put a little oil in there bc its balls cold out an let's go night sledding girl

9994 2018-02-06 00:17:19 You should take your car every 3 or 4months for oil change.

10003 2018-02-06 00:15:43 @taste_team I may have missed something guys but why is your shopping list/Coles purchase process so bad? I add 10 dishes worth of ingredients, only to find Coles is telling me to buy 10 x bottles of olive oil, 10 x this, 10 x that.... Is it that hard to consolidate the items?
10004 2018-02-06 00:15:39 Well I stuck my finger in the puddle and it’s def oil so I’m thinking it’s not mine and I’m just being paranoid but still

10006 2018-02-06 00:15:29 Long time #Audi fan. Royally annoyed now. We've been having so many problems with one of ours (the A4) over the last few years - reoccurring oil & fuel issues. Now they are quoting $5k to fix a busted intake spring valve. Thinking long & hard about buying three #Tesla's instead.
10007 2018-02-06 00:15:20 Lemurian, Atlantis was a phonic substance that is to the coherence - the resistance of the known But that oil is animating
