In commodities the most important aspects shaping the forward curve are supply & demand, cost and supply of storage, and well as legal/tax.

Hopefully I timed it well last week entering (followed story for months). Good strong catalyst stock & sub £25mil mcap high potential of a bagger in coming weeks if commodities play well. #ARCM

33 2018-08-18 21:28:28 Apple was the first to popularize multitouch, and Tesla is the first to popularize lithium battery EVs. But those are both commodities.
34 2018-08-18 21:24:42 The Fed controls the Amount of Dollars in Suply through by issuing them  on securities like commodities, Gold , Oil, Tea,Coffee .It is the standardisiert commodity pricing Currency.  The more people trade the more dollars the US has to issue.
35 2018-08-18 21:10:27 Also how it feels some days raising commodities in these markets
36 2018-08-18 21:10:05 WOMAN AT POINT ZERO
Ama Darko was feeling generous when she described women as being on point zero. Women in the typical African society have gone way below that line. 
Dear men, 
Women are not commodities to be acquired. We see, breathe, feel and have ambitions too. Respect that
37 2018-08-18 21:09:26 LEGO is an ex for tribe. Apple for an ecosystem that started w/ a tribe. Tesla is building one. Continuous innovation in product is assumed at all these companies. ICE cars are commodities -yet does someone win all? Nah! There will be competition that will only help scale demand.
38 2018-08-18 21:07:58 I agree that this has happened lots with commodities, what I'm looking for is examples of it happening with a non-commodity money (that is, monetary premium accruing from zero), especially at the rate at which Bitcoin has been doing it
39 2018-08-18 21:05:05 Most farmers produce “commodities”. By definition, that means product quality varies little from producer to producer. So some customers notice products that are produced differently. If they have money to spend on that difference, they will! It’s capitalism.
40 2018-08-18 21:00:49 Na only cheap commodities dem dey rush for market
41 2018-08-18 20:44:39 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
42 2018-08-18 20:42:33  How tf is water nasty?? If we didn't have any of the commodities we have available today your ass would be dead or unhealthy af lol
43 2018-08-18 20:16:28 For those under general election, and buying/selling commodities? (Not intended at all
44 2018-08-18 20:12:18 Ladies, you make yourself sexual commodities when the only value you offer to men is your sexuality...
45 2018-08-18 20:09:16 Direct tax payers are major role for progress of india. So, why INDIAN citizens are paying GST for purchasing their basic necessities commodities. I think you needs to refer invoices of purchasing carefully.
46 2018-08-18 20:04:46 Yes! It’s pretty interesting that this was their priority list of commodities that they were comparing prices of.
47 2018-08-18 20:02:48 If you have to ask this I have to question if you even read it. The whole point of the ducat was having a stable value relative to commodities. Bitcoin is a fucking roller coaster. Hayek valued equilibrium. Bitcoin is anything but.
48 2018-08-18 19:58:12 This both touched me and made me think - two rare commodities on the interwebs of late. Thank you for sharing your story.
49 2018-08-18 19:47:39 We trust on your capabilities and insha'Allah you will achive required results very soon. May be I am wrong Just few suggestion.
Reduces prices of basic commodities (petrol, gas, eatable items etc) and increase taxes on luxuries (car, import, house of greater then 240 yards, etc)
50 2018-08-18 19:16:06 that is, the things that people need (information) and the means by which they exchange tangible goods (commodities) are stored primarily with two companies. what could go wrong.
51 2018-08-18 19:11:55 Né?! Que diacho de país é esse que depende tanto do petróleo? Diversos outros países tem a sua economia baseada nele, mas fizeram o dever de casa em estruturar as suas outras commodities. Pq só foi a Venezuela está na crise humanitária?
52 2018-08-18 19:11:28 completely abhorrent use of academic power by Judith Butler. she is a thoroughly commodified "public intellectual". her ideas are commodities that sell in the marketplace. don't assume you know the character of an academic b/c of what they write. #JudithButler #AvitalRonell
53 2018-08-18 19:08:58 It may be taxes on #Gas may be incorporated into a general tax overhaul schema, but on their own; taxes on commodities or everyday goods have the greatest impact on the lowest incomes. We need #Corporate/#WallStreet tax reform and it must be carefully calculated to share the load
54 2018-08-18 19:02:31 Sneaker heads are one of the most bizarre fandoms/ collectors that I know. They give Nike obscene amounts of money for what amounts to unusable commodities. I understand Jordan has quite the cult of personality, but the hundreds of millions they make on his likeness is absurd.

56 2018-08-18 18:56:55 We've managed to raise about 50k in 2 days, the response is overwhelming cause we send our contributors with the detailed list of commodities purchased inclusive of all receipts. So they're spreading word and helping us out as well.
57 2018-08-18 18:48:06 It is essential that @realDonaldTrump, @DOIDepSec,
& @SecretaryZinke are not allowed to drain the #Mojave
for their sole purpose of enriching their oily corporate comrades. Our wild lands are not commodities to be sold to the highest bidder.

58 2018-08-18 18:35:25 Olhe o Brasil antes do Plano Real, após Plano Real e  posse do Larápio. Olhe o valor das commodities e a economia mundial favorável  a ele, o que raramente veremos outra igual. Apresenta qualquer medida benéfica feita por esse corrupto no Brasil. Não existe! Surfou no plano real!
59 2018-08-18 18:27:54 Security clearances are high dollar commodities that net 6 figure income for people like Brennan. They are the media's "anonymous sources" instead of being journalist and digging into a story, they just pay people for the info shared by ex-gov't emp. YANK THEM ALL!!!!
60 2018-08-18 18:27:25 Armageddon. God will not allow them to decipher the human soul. The human soul and human DNA are the most prized and valuable and wanted commodities in the entire universe, and that is why all the nephilim aliens and chimera aliens come to the earth, in order to harvest human
61 2018-08-18 18:23:54 They shd just go n sell Arsenal players on Konga .com .. As fairly used commodities. 

Useless ppl, Lazy .. Can't run, and cluesless.  They can't come n gimme hypertension  RUbbish
62 2018-08-18 18:22:24 I am not a Trekkie, but I thought the point of Ferengi was they treat everyone like commodities to be exploited. Satires of capitalism, basically. Doesn’t DS9 show them giving women rights, specifically because it will increase profit?
63 2018-08-18 18:18:56 If it’s all the same bubble (it is) what did we learn this week?
1. Turkey is blowing up.
2. Peak Elon has been seen.
3. FANG’s are leaking badly.
4. AAPL is last man standing.
5. Commodities tanking.
Lots of pins puncturing the “hopium” psychology.  Wait for it......Timber!
64 2018-08-18 18:11:17 big up e gyal them weh nah fuck fi credit or small commodities. big up e gyal them weh a fuck fi all inclusive weekends at Hyatt enuh, rich bitch shit 
65 2018-08-18 18:05:36 ANYONE who believes in socialism as a form of an economic exchange of commodities,  MUST ALSO BELIEVE IN WORKING FOR FREE.  Or you’re a thief stealing from someone who has not worked for free.
66 2018-08-18 18:01:32 Amazon is best where structured information is path to optimal purchase decision (commodities, AWS). Like buying through an API. 

And weakest where we buy on seduction (heterogeneous goods like fashion, original tv shows).
67 2018-08-18 18:01:16 @AgriPacCons la protección arancelaria de 3% a la industria mas competitiva es indefendible, en cuanto al valor agregado es bajísimo la harina y el aceite son commodities
68 2018-08-18 18:00:13 Most people on Earth live in a “Poor” country and its even worst for them.  But if you allow people to acquire HUGE wealth quickly, they will find a way to expand the amount of commodities in the world.

69 2018-08-18 17:36:17 It’s not just about cost but also price and selection. You can’t just open a poultry farm and start selling eggs to a store. SM commodities are strictly regulated.
70 2018-08-18 17:25:47 The increasing price of commodities concerns me very much. Like, i'm a very basic person, yet i'm already struggling to afford the basic needs. I'm also very disappointed with the authorities for failing to calculate the indirect impacts of the train law.
71 2018-08-18 17:23:32 The UPC is a new party that was est in July of 2017.There are definite ups and downs as in any economy based on commodities. I say lets learn from the past & Lessons teach us there has never been a successful socialist gov anywhere.Ever.This NDP gov was no diffenent.All Bust.
72 2018-08-18 17:22:43 Wonderful leaders are rarest commodities in the world. Let's pray for him...
73 2018-08-18 17:22:26 There are many tariffs on differt commodities and products from many differnt countries, which ones are causing the farmers distress?
74 2018-08-18 17:14:25 As you supply medication,equip your facilities with pharmacy professionals to handle the commodities!
75 2018-08-18 17:05:03 3200: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
76 2018-08-18 17:03:07 Due to the presence of social media. Dating apps and less conservative mind set. We just see humans as commodities.
77 2018-08-18 17:02:46 OK... Not sure what that was meant to accomplish there. We're talking about a country that is a cornerstone of the modern capitalist economy. The vast majority of American commodities come from China. The idea that China is building infrastructure is silly.
78 2018-08-18 17:01:23 Just watched @BBCPanorama's the  sex pest president @realDonaldTrump. GIRLS as young as 14 being used at his parties, shocking and disgusting and as one victim said 'worse that Harvey Weinstein'. Women are not commodities. #MeToo
79 2018-08-18 16:55:43 I mean, it is what we do today with stock market, bond exchange and commodities: we do not directly block access to them to minorities and those discriminated, but we sure make it look like a white dude game and everyone on it is oh-so-smart. A lie that fuels the gap.
80 2018-08-18 16:51:25 My Bigger IRA Account is  62% Equities   35% Cash    2.47% Fixed Income  . Equities  47% small cap 4% International  .

81 2018-08-18 16:34:52 Sir, Can you also let us know the price of commodities comparision between two regimes to understand much further on the GDP please.
82 2018-08-18 16:32:39 Farage part of Alt-right & backed by US nasty Alt-right S Bannon ,Trump.Farage was Privately educated at Dulwich College. On leaving school he became a London commodities trader .His father was a city Stockbroker.  IMO,Farage does not have citizens best interests at hart
83 2018-08-18 16:18:26 u know what sucks is that north’s backstory could actually have been a cool message abt how women are made into commodities for men to literally buy and consume esp for a video game which attracts a very certain kind of male audience, if only cage weren’t A Man and also Like That
84 2018-08-18 16:16:59 Randeep 
Let him do whatever he wants to, let them play politics 
People are contributing
Make sure everyone gets commodities which is the need of the hour. Every penny  is important and it means a lot 
Everything will be fine In Sha Allah 
Next week things will be better

85 2018-08-18 16:09:20 Did you just say commodities?? Bruh commodities oh be bless sweet heart
86 2018-08-18 16:07:53 Betsy wants to privatize educations and her brother wants to privatize the military. What can possibly go wrong when billionaires control government?! We the people get treated like commodities that FILTHY RICH believe they can buy & sell at will. We become their slaves. #RESIST
87 2018-08-18 16:01:59 UPA was 10 % not economy ? High prices of all commodities.Inflation at pick etc
88 2018-08-18 15:37:28 On top of the fact that the rest of the students are treated as commodities as well.  They're being cheerleaders for corporate greed
89 2018-08-18 15:33:52 I worked for Midwest Agri commodities at the Didsbury plant until it burnt.
90 2018-08-18 15:16:59 Seee!!! The list of atrocities and incompetent actions is endless. It was under him that Nigerians suffered "essential commodities"!
91 2018-08-18 15:01:06 Smith was wrong. Marx showed that wages of a worker are determined by the value of the worker's commodity, his labor.power, by the minimum cost to keep the worker and his family alive. Under capitalism humans are converted into commodities, things. Power is a function of class.
92 2018-08-18 15:00:50 E tatuará um texto na mão sobre commodities na hora do "diálogo"!
93 2018-08-18 14:42:43 So true we in agriculture have become so specialized that we don't always understand other commodities. One of the best aspects of @FarmFoodCareON is joint meeting & round tables hearing about what is going on.  Eye opener & educator for all. #Dairy #Grain #poultry #hort #ontag
94 2018-08-18 14:41:40 People on here are not commodities.
95 2018-08-18 14:35:55 Let's put our minds together & really get it right. You've got your sleeves rolled up in the commodities markets, while I've got mine on virtually all key currencies, any/all global sovereign debt risks & the geopolitical underworld. Call me if ur awake!
96 2018-08-18 14:34:17 There are no stars on Mastodon; followers/rt/favs are no longer commodities. Nobody cares about that shit. It’s so much better
97 2018-08-18 14:33:30 Reserve banks use SDR to measure commodities on their websites. That says ‘Hard Asset Future’ to me
98 2018-08-18 14:29:48 Duhalde volteó a De La Rua. Y los términos de intercambio y precios de commodities en 2002 ya eran excelentes. Hubiéramos tenido un despegue de verdad, no como la mentira populista q nos dejó peor que antes. Peronismo NUNCA MÁS.
99 2018-08-18 14:28:54 The world's top three commodities are:
3) petroleum;
2) black market drugs; and
1) arms to protect them.

This fundamental truth usually hides in a dark corner. I seriously doubt Trump is only about hotels & golf resorts.
100 2018-08-18 14:12:00 Hmm. Yes. A very favourable coincidence, I think not.

And, no the fall in the pound isn't great for manufacturing because it also impacts the cost of importing materials and components and the cost of commodities, such as energy.
101 2018-08-18 14:04:37 Arukutty an mla has sent 16 tons rations and essential commodities to kerela. Kindly verify facts plz
102 2018-08-18 14:02:36 Los precios de los commodities fueron con ella, desde 2007 a 2013
103 2018-08-18 14:01:29 Almacenemos chocolates y heredemolos a los hijos para que en ese año se vuelvan ricos. Se convertirán en commodities.
104 2018-08-18 13:59:23 Farmers should realize markets that close to their commodities won’t open again, the markets have found other suppliers
105 2018-08-18 13:59:16 Precious commodities!
106 2018-08-18 13:57:20 Paving way for global bonds, global equities, global commodities... Governments would be very much interested in launching Global Bonds Offerings on our platform and then post issuance, it is ready to be traded on our platform.
107 2018-08-18 13:54:24 Ah! I had to move between 3 servers to get pets to sell.

Unlike the commodities, once a person has it they're done for life.
108 2018-08-18 13:50:53 Tendrían que estar todos presos desde la intendencia de Río Gallegos! Así hoy Argentina con los años de bonanza de commodities sería potencia mundial..
109 2018-08-18 13:45:29 “Generational wealth” ? I remember as a kid being on welfare, picking up “commodities” (Government issued food), wearing the same pair of pants to school every day cuz I only had 1 pair, not going to college cuz I couldn’t pay for it. Doesn’t sound like wealth to me.
110 2018-08-18 13:42:26 African People are NOT your Commodities for "buying and selling"! 

The problem is that most White have absolutely no sense of Morality!
111 2018-08-18 13:41:53 War is the systematic murder of the poor who are treated like disposable commodities by the ruling elites.
112 2018-08-18 13:40:04 GBPUSD Weekly Technical Outlook: Short-Term Chart Shows Upward Momentum: We have recently released our Q3 Trading Forecasts for a wide range of Currencies and Commodities, including GBPUSD with our fundamental and ...
113 2018-08-18 13:26:56 Oprah is discussing the commodities market... trading cheese for lettuce.
114 2018-08-18 12:46:21 With respect, this isn’t the 50s. No one gives a toss about the UK on the world stage. Brexit is making us irrelevant. We might be ‘strong’, but a lack of medicines, food imports and other commodities will test that.

But you keep going with that lie of British exceptionalism...
115 2018-08-18 12:39:12 Kathy Ireland after meeting the commodities sales agent: 'It takes two to have an argument.'
116 2018-08-18 12:30:24 The founding fathers did what made sense to them at the time. You increase the cost of low margin commodities, creating shortages and driving up cost on high margin finished goods. Steel goes up, now your assembly system is uncompetitive. 
117 2018-08-18 12:21:40 It has been a 1way ticket...
Buy US$
Sell commodities

The renew US-china talks should turn this trade around till 8/23. Expect US$ to retest 95, break or not depending on the success of the meeting(keep fingers crossed)

I'm fully loaded again on $jnug $gasl
118 2018-08-18 12:14:21 Dubai they have short distance ( metro )
And it’s one of their commodities that earn them revenue... look at our SGR lol   380 billion what the hell is this ..  when Will we pay this debt  . Oh but we’re already paying they increased shipping cost manugu
119 2018-08-18 12:01:20 Vending what commodities?
120 2018-08-18 11:58:19 There's a project on the go at the Crown Commercial Service to implement exactly that. My boss is leaving me next week to lead it. It sounds like a really interesting way to revolutionise public procurement by driving competition in commodities and bulk discounts.
121 2018-08-18 11:50:46 #betterwithfriends @ffweekend Of all the jobs that the Trump tariffs have created, how many have been lost? Furthermore, how much more expensive will commodities get? The loss may be greater than the gain.
122 2018-08-18 11:50:36 hace años jugaban a las escondidas atrás de dos países caros ARG y BR- devaluaron como locos y acá no-Genios de FA! todo para asegurarse el voto de la eleccion 2019, no llegamos ni a palos; cierran empresas productoras de commodities y le sigue el pobre turismo, son o se hacen?
123 2018-08-18 11:42:05 Ora bem, esta venda de moedas e compra de USD para comprar commodities (petroleo a principal), permite manter o USD artificialmente elevado. Bem mais do que se deixar de entrar nas compras de commodities.  
É esta fortaleza que permite manter o USD como moeda reserva.
124 2018-08-18 11:38:25 * Freedom is one of the most expensive commodities. No amount of money will be enough to buy freedom.

But Financial freedom is much more than having money. It's the
freedom to be who you really are and do what you really want in life.
125 2018-08-18 11:24:43 De 2004 a 2015 lograron bajar 9,8 puntos del PBI con las tasas internacionales cero, los valores de los commodities mas altos de la historia y un tipo de cambio sin atraso (al principio). Son un desastre con suerte. Eso si, el actual sigue la linea. Iguales indicadores + deuda.
126 2018-08-18 11:21:37 Yes, what would people working in the NHS know about the NHS, compared to a commodities trader?
127 2018-08-18 10:45:32 Commentable inflow of commodities to collection camps.All camps in tvm are active and crowded.Great effort and unity from malayalis. Shops have no stock for napkins, candles, dettol etc in TVM.

129 2018-08-18 10:09:23 Meeting this demand drives complexity and additional costs when non-GM commodities are in short supply. Where feasible we will provide consumers with a choice for non-GM products.
130 2018-08-18 10:06:26 #WezeshaJamii Mwiti: There are no spaces for small traders to sell their commodities. It costs KSH. 1500/= for women in the slum to acquire clean water. This makes it difficult for them to participate in NHIF and NSSF.

132 2018-08-18 09:02:24 I’m glad for Cavite! That’s an awesome project, however you have to take into consideration the target market of sachets in Manila—lower class people. If they can barely afford such commodities, should we expect them to go out of their way to go to recycling centers?
133 2018-08-18 09:01:10 6. Middle and very low class families now had opportunities to feed and have access to basic essential commodities which were far out of their reach.
WAI was on course and you dare not resale what you bought at controlled price.
Smuggling was discouraged and Nigeria was on course

136 2018-08-18 08:42:17 5. I don't know your age,but I can tell you for free,that we usually go to Ring Road in Benin to queue where these commodities imported by the Buhari government or those sizes from hoarders are sold at controlled price . A family gets a bag of rice,carton of milk,soap,oil etc

Because he ordered those hoarding these essential commodities to sale it to the public ,but refused because of profiteering .

152 2018-08-18 06:48:24 Not so sure about batteries. And ICEs are to some extent also commodities ie no real difference between an Audi and a Porsche engine. Yet, through branding they make us perceive them as different resulting in different margins.

203 2018-08-18 00:58:08 I appreciate your argument, I really do. I just think there is a distinction between access to healthcare and access to commodities. There's no need for govt involvement in cars, groceries, etc but healthcare is worth subsidizing to ensure basic access.
204 2018-08-18 00:55:51 “but an FDA supervisor wrote to an EPA official that the corn was not considered an “official sample”.

205 2018-08-18 00:55:04 Do we want to be in the blue collar unskilled commodities market?  Does the American worker want to compete with Chinese hours and low salaries?  Doesn’t it make sense to focus on skilled labor growth?  I think that is what we are good at and where the brightest future is.

1) That float is so massive, a squeeze would rarely come into play
2) XOM very tied to price of oil obviously... all commodities have been going down bcuz the are denominated in dollars which have been going up....
209 2018-08-18 00:13:41 It’s because the argument is too reductive and suggests schools are conveyor belts for producing commodities- of course they need skills but these are nurtured in a holistic sense. Preparing for the workforce is a, but not the, purpose of schools.

215 2018-08-19 23:39:00 a capitalist can dictate the conditions under which her laborer must work.  under capitalism, the main condition is that the worker must agree to labor for a time greater than what is necessary to produce the commodities value.

228 2018-08-19 21:55:37 two commodities can only be exchanged on the open market because the value of the two commodities is being abstracted to some third term that functions as some sort of "universal equivalent" (i.e. money).

234 2018-08-19 23:39:00 a capitalist can dictate the conditions under which her laborer must work.  under capitalism, the main condition is that the worker must agree to labor for a time greater than what is necessary to produce the commodities value.
235 2018-08-19 23:26:47 Tinha emprego porque as nossas commodities estavam em alta e haviam empresas investindo aqui. Lula assumiu, aproveitou as "vacas gordas" e pegou muito dinheiro pra dividir com os amiguinhos e jogou resto pra população, que é o que você chama de assistências sociais.
236 2018-08-19 23:18:02 Maybe she had the same "cattle commodities broker" that Hillary had so many years ago!
237 2018-08-19 23:12:18 Seems like some men trying to to sell commodities.
238 2018-08-19 22:47:44 I agree that some comments are just hateful, but many of the comments stem from genuine concern for Dakota. It's easy to fall off the wagon, & you will agree the industry tends to treat girls as commodities & not people with feelings & issues.
239 2018-08-19 22:36:17 They’re not. You also have manslaughter, rape, fraud, assault, selling drugs. Majority of cost comes from time in prison. My point is the cost of jail time. We’re paying enough as it is to jail them and give them the *commodities* they already have. They don’t need minimum wage.
240 2018-08-19 22:34:26 Probably will get an AC soon... RIP My electricity bill, but Heil the commodities of the XXI century.

244 2018-08-19 22:08:39 Forget football. Pep is light years ahead of Mourinho just in terms of how he interacts with his players. Summed up by the way he speaks about them as people rather than commodities.

246 2018-08-19 21:58:32 Siempre es difícil superar al bad boy del ex que dejó 30% de pobreza después del superciclo de commodities más grande del siglo. Nos pone mucha presión a los cambiemitas en la primera cita.
247 2018-08-19 21:55:37 two commodities can only be exchanged on the open market because the value of the two commodities is being abstracted to some third term that functions as some sort of "universal equivalent" (i.e. money).
248 2018-08-19 21:52:38 Fake news. They left out he made a fortune in wheat and sugar commodities. Bought a cattle ranch and ate all his cows before retiring to his flooded underground shelter on an earthquake zone in sunny Costa Rica after contracting the Zika virus. The good life.
249 2018-08-19 21:51:12 'left-wing madrassas'?? Has he visited a uni recently? If anything unis have become retailers but without the operations and finance wherewithal to run businesses! And why should they? You wouldn't expect schools to treat pupils as commodities. Oh right...
250 2018-08-19 21:39:37 Hard to make predictions in such a volatile market, but have to think the USD will weaken on positive news regarding China/US trade talks which should also see commodities get a bounce in return. $GDX $GDXJ $GLD $SLV $HG_F $GC_F $SI_F

252 2018-08-19 21:21:18 If we're being honest & serious as Nigerians, we need a new government. Things are really worse now, prices of commodities are really rising. It's hard to even eat 3 square meals these days, people are dying.
253 2018-08-19 21:15:34 lamentablemente, no se mantuvo la inversión al acabarse el gobierno de Menem, ya que resultó insuficiente en realidad para el boom de la soja y commodities de mediados de los 2000.
Fueron 12 ultimos años de terror
254 2018-08-19 21:13:02 La infraestructura construida por el doctor Menem durante su presidencia permitio que crecieramos espectacularmente con el boom de los commodities en la década kirchnerista.Todo ese capital se consumio con los K pero fue creado por el mejor gobierno del siglo XX.
255 2018-08-19 20:57:32 Black people are like "commodities" to the brainwashing democrats and many of their communities essentially are Democratic Plantations.
256 2018-08-19 20:51:21 Metals, Commodities, etc. are a byproduct of inflation/bear markets. Look at CPI; look at Deficit vs GDP - Deficit is/has been out of control. We should have curtailed spending with the bull run, but failed miserably. Economy is a house of cards. More wild swings before the crash
257 2018-08-19 20:50:46 people know this but don't care as long as they've got their first world commodities and luxuries they're happy to call impoverished downtrodden people preferably muslims, terrorist that we need to invade and destroy, or just give them weapons and a reason to kill each other.
258 2018-08-19 20:50:13 You're jubilating that you benefited from essential commodities under Buhari in the early 80's and you're telling me what??
259 2018-08-19 20:45:07 White people be like I like paying high prices for commodities and rent if it means I don’t have to leave near brown people
260 2018-08-19 20:38:28 I highly recommend @realDonaldTrump read, or listen to “Before We Were Yours” by Lisa Wingate. Children are not commodities.
261 2018-08-19 20:34:18 Pero vas a dejar de lado que tuvieron los valores de las commodities mas altas de la historia y que pese a eso no se logró desarrollar la industria y seguimos dependiendo del estado? Ese escenario será irrepetible y no lo supimos aprovechar
262 2018-08-19 20:33:04 Perhaps its more apt to compare Bitcoin with Commodities or currencies.

264 2018-08-19 20:10:22 Gold is flowing to China.  For millennia, nations gaining gold were winning economically & those losing it were losing - see US 1914-1971, for example.  China’s gaining control of physical commodities.  If this wasn’t worrisome, US wouldn’t be doing what it’s doing worldwide.
265 2018-08-19 20:03:57 I never once said that the issue of over-incarceration is bad, there is an issue there, but asking for commodities in PRISON is ridiculous.
266 2018-08-19 20:03:44 Ironically food and other commodities are costlier in lokoja compared to some other places. I can't really tell the reason why though, but that's a fact.
267 2018-08-19 20:00:42 One day you'll hear of even poisoned rice. Leave alone sugar and other commodities.

269 2018-08-19 19:55:09 Practically I have read all books! Biggest benefited reading Stock & Commodities and later the same authors who would write came up with books. JoMur is a core book.
Your own Observations is more important Imitating any Book.
270 2018-08-19 19:43:13 Am finding unexplained explosion of VAT on my receipts leading to high prices of commodities,am I alone?
271 2018-08-19 19:41:21 The banker who trades in commodities is a murderer.
272 2018-08-19 19:41:06 Yemen has no minimum age for marriages. 2/3 of Yemen girls  are married before the age of 18. Girls are seen as commodities and are sold off because the family feel they are burdens.
273 2018-08-19 19:19:57 More than half of the garbage in the DSNY baskets are recyclable. And the DSNY public recyling cans are a disaster. All commodities are mixed :(
274 2018-08-19 19:15:44 I hear ya man, when I was kid we got gov't cheese and other commodities, you gotta make sure your bunch eats
275 2018-08-19 19:13:15 W/E Wrap:
Equities and commodities inched higher on trade optimism and a general lack of bad economic news; those same themes, coupled with a "should we be worried about this" US consumer sentiment survey release, weighed on the #USD, elevating pretty much every other currency.
276 2018-08-19 19:09:04 In Zim,the Reserve Bank went as far as importing basic commodities...lol
277 2018-08-19 19:08:02 This is interesting!!! Anyway, I wouldn't want to stretch further, but the post-recession inflation affected a lot of commodities. Food commodities being the hardest hit, but I think that special BEANS + PLANTAIN has stuck around N200-250. I miss it very much
278 2018-08-19 19:07:01 @netflix @MTV one of y'all should make a cooking show we're the only ingredients are foods you get from commodities 
279 2018-08-19 18:48:15 My pleasure. I’ve dedicated 15 years of my life to uranium and am happy to help as I can and as allowed based on my positions. Unlike other commodities the knowledge pool is very shallow and there is a lot of misinformation peddled by biased parties. Can’t stress this enough.
280 2018-08-19 18:45:30 ... keep borrowing to fund budget and pay salaries,the national debt will keep increasing until it gets to a point whereby price of commodities are skyrocketing and the government could not afford to increase wages to catch-up with the inflation demand. It’s a proven fact
281 2018-08-19 18:43:23 Tras 14 años de gobierno FA y una década de bonanza gracias a China y a los precios de los commodities, no nos queda nada que indique que las perspectivas a futuro son buenas, todo lo contrario. Hoy el FA grita que tiene #ElMejorPrograma y #ProponemosFuturo. Solo para fanáticos.
282 2018-08-19 18:42:52 He can be able to start paying that but mind you, it’s not going to be sustainable for the government. As it stance right now our nation debt has tremendously increased. If a leader only think of attacking increase in price of commodities by increasing wages while w keep ....

284 2018-08-19 18:37:14 You’re not wrong. And now is the time for change. Athletes should not be treated as replaceable commodities in a globals sports complex. #thisiswhyIfight
285 2018-08-19 18:31:59 I don’t feel like looking it up haha. Be my guest. But the gist is that he alluded to the point that guys on the bench knew they were better than starters, and the coaches played the favorites and known commodities. Which isn’t shocking in the least bit with Marvin
286 2018-08-19 18:17:48 The new Pakistani PM promises to lead from the front on the much needed austerity hence will be auctioning the previous PM’s lavish commodities and remaining remnants of “izzat”. #Tabdeeli zindabad !

292 2018-08-19 17:44:46 Kerala is facing a difficult situation right now.

The flood is over, however it's effects are still going on.

Daily problems in an average life:
No water supply
No food or commodities

People have stocked up supplies.

293 2018-08-19 17:36:01 No reduction in cost of commodities/cost of living? #PMIKAddress @PTIofficial
294 2018-08-19 17:25:36 Adani/Ambanis/Jindals/Essar have 0 presence in High tech manufacturing -Capital goods , auto, Electronics ,etc. No innovation , no competition. Mostly in Core sector industries/Mining/extraction/Commodities/Running Infra/Public utilities. Not much different from Russian oligarchy
295 2018-08-19 17:17:53 There is no such thing as ‘good’ in this corporate world where shareholders steal pensions and use tradespeople as commodities. We are just chips on their roulette table and the house always wins.
296 2018-08-19 17:15:41 such nakedness use words like boldness to make it sound good when in reality its just the lack of shame and embarrassment and readiness to seen and treated as sex commodities and exhibition objects by removing all clothes .Sexual objectification is what it is .U can use any
297 2018-08-19 17:05:20 Who is talking abt policy achievement?What concern independent traders with d govt essential commodities programme? You have no idea of what d issue is all about. Do urself a favour and look into 9ja btw '83 and '85, maybe dn u'll have idea of d issues raied
298 2018-08-19 16:59:42 It's not money dat is required. Essential commodities like food items, coordinated rescue operations, Medicines,  drinking water;these r what is required which centre is despatching on a war footing. Money will easily be diverted or siphoned off as in d case of Ptsunami  funds!!
299 2018-08-19 16:58:14 Under this racist SOB People are treated like commodities and therefore could be trashed. He is dangerous to America itself and the World as a Whole. Did You SOB forget to use the words Migration , a term also in The English Language.
300 2018-08-19 16:37:32 Yup. When u appoint your family member to a top position, then of course u will have to pay for commodities with "God"
301 2018-08-19 16:30:27 Post Emergency relief would be different when many accredited NGOs move in for rehabilitation. Right now essential commodities should be the priority, IMO. But, anything is welcome. And, nothing is too much. #KeralaFloods #KeralaFloodRelief
302 2018-08-19 16:29:01 Sir that's because centre itself has taken all relief work and distribution of essential commodities in its own hands. NDRF, Army and RSS are actively participating in relief activity. BTW how much West Bengal has contributed in Relief Operations.
303 2018-08-19 16:25:10 And what a huge gamble that is. Imo, it's more a combination of arrogance and stupidity - there is no development behind RT just proven worse commodities.
304 2018-08-19 16:17:07 Assalamualaikum,

After Eid prayers we shall send commodities but we need a quick transport for the goods to arrive in Kerala .Since Seacargo takes huge lot of time , We require the help of UAE Airforce by Air cargo to send this fast and it reaches the people of Kerala. @faz3

306 2018-08-19 16:05:55 Ya'll gotta realize it is absolutely not okay to ship real people like that. 
BTS boys aren't toys and commodities you can force shipping and headcanons on. I've seen some nasty shit that people have tweet DIRECTLY TO THESE GUYS. Some of you have ZERO respect for your favs.

309 2018-08-19 15:49:20 Empower yourself by being stronger than the capitalist urge to consume addictive commodities.
310 2018-08-19 15:48:00 Fair enough. I tend to agree with you. I also think it's not apples-to-apples because in late 1990s there was no embedded index long positions in commodities from pensions, endowments, etc (the asset allocation consultants). Therefore, short position today could be higher today
311 2018-08-19 15:40:50 Sir, India is price taker in major commodities that we consume such as crude oil. Under UPA rule, there was boom in commodity prices. Oil soared to $150 dollar per barrel. So managing inflation in such times is uncontrollable. Hope you understand that.
312 2018-08-19 15:29:36 Yeah that’s true. I think part of the problem is just the natural decline through age of the well-known commodities at TE. Olsen is about finished with his career, Gronk deals with injuries on a yearly basis, and there is a lack of high end options.
313 2018-08-19 15:29:18 EG 100 years ago: “We are rationed for several essential things, but there is no real shortage of general commodities. Cheese is unobtainable, and one or two things difficult to get, but we are far from starvation. We all long for the end of this terrible' struggle." (W.H.Hills)
314 2018-08-19 15:23:25 The way GoK is going about with #corruption is laudable. But what about lousy transformers, hiked prices of commodities and the like?
315 2018-08-19 15:17:47 Guardate la demagogia, Según la UCA 6 millones de personas pasan hambre en argentina. No siembran comida siembran commodities.
316 2018-08-19 14:57:26 2.  No such thing as Free or Fair Markets........farm subsidies, outsourcing to private sector, Oil and commodities productions reports, post office, interstates, defense so called open bids processes where to compete, players have to find and build prototypes...all fixed markets
317 2018-08-19 14:44:42 There is no such thing as a theological resistance to materialism. That's because our souls are the commodities clergy regulate, trade, and profit from.
318 2018-08-19 14:40:33 “I’m playing a game where some of the players are literally slaves farming virtual commodities. The game was written by brutally treated workers effectively owned by their fascist corporations. Beat that, Soviets!”
319 2018-08-19 14:37:04 Well said. People forget that the prices of oil, commodities was sky high at that time.
320 2018-08-19 14:36:42 Sir, you have successfully outsourced the rescue effort to ARMY/Navy....and you r just interested in making money out of this disaster what u need is commodities lik water/milk/blanket/food... pls stop asking money from eyerywhr and start doing the rescue ...
321 2018-08-19 14:11:17 As per the 3 commodities or party favours?
322 2018-08-19 14:06:57 National Dress !!.... Khuday Khair ka. 
Who decides, who represents, what ?

I am sure most of us consume commodities (Including clothes) that have nothing to with our "culture". Indigenous cultures have been unable to stop the onslaught of globalization and capitalism.

324 2018-08-19 13:41:04 You’re foolish. The US govt operates an affordable food policy, insuring staples: corn, wheat, cotton and milk are largest programs. Most other commodities have no safety net.
325 2018-08-19 13:10:47 They have tested their strategy for the 2019 elections, vote buying with cash and commodities in Ekiti and Kogi, and it worked. They don't care anymore, they will treat us like shit. On that day, roll out the cash and onions, GBAM!!!! Electoral victory is guaranteed. God help us
326 2018-08-19 12:58:50 FORCING THE PEOPLE TO ACCEPT FEDERALISM AS PRICES OF BASIC COMMODITIES SOAR HIGH WITH MORE ADDITIONAL TAXES AWAITS MEANS - SLAVERY OF FILIPINO PEOPLE.
327 2018-08-19 12:49:27 In both commercial & military practice, we do not fly bulk water & hay (or other bulk commodities) overseas. 99.7% of Australia's exports (by volume) travel in ships for this very reason.

330 2018-08-19 12:36:24 Mmm....'Nothing is free'. So if among sections of society, the price of commodities/services go beyond their ability to pay, what's your response? Tough shit - nothing is free! As a human race, we can do better than that by building an economy for all the people, not just the 1%.

334 2018-08-19 11:59:45 Dude I'm vegetarian. Calm down. Have you actually researched the environmental disaster the cattle industry causes? Rainforests are torched so that the trees make way for grazing fields for the cattle commodities. That should also concern you.
335 2018-08-19 11:57:34 We can place order through Amazon for essential commodities required for the flood relief camps as they have tied up with NGOs. It’s easy and fast. I did my bit... please contribute #KeralaDonationChallenge @annavetticad
336 2018-08-19 11:43:28 Things like the government price fixing agricultural commodities, then subsidizing farmers not to grow. The government literally takes a percentage of certain crops each harvest. It’s supposed to be a market cost but never is. 2/
337 2018-08-19 11:43:07 The same coke we buy in Gh for 3.50 is sold for an equivalent of 1gh in Nigeria.  Let's not argue this.  Since 2006 when the decimalization was done the prices of commodities have increased more than 50 times.  In 2013 circle to lapaz was 70p. Today it's 2.50. Still d same in 9ja
338 2018-08-19 11:33:50 Never destroy a book with dog-ears or writing! Never. Books are precious commodities! :)
339 2018-08-19 11:07:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
340 2018-08-19 11:06:28 Perhaps others should change the the way they work.  Necessity is the mother of invention, not conformity.  What the world needs is to stop accepting each other as if they are commodities to serve the the few.
341 2018-08-19 10:40:36 Assolutamente. Solo che adesso va contenuto e ridotto.
Non apriamo il "file" di come fare a ridurre il debito: se eludiamo da questioni che non abbiano un riscontro di politica industriale correlate a "commodities" e energia mi devo arrendere. Solo q.b. di economia aziendale.

343 2018-08-19 10:33:29 Siguiendo su forma de pensar propongo:
- Desincentivar el consumo de estos (precios e impuestos altos ayudan)
- Continuar comprando petróleo y gas en el extranjero, para
- mantener altas las reservas de estos “commodities” y lo utilicen nuestros hijos.

...algo no me cuadró
344 2018-08-19 10:20:17 And it is not like China is not paying for said commodities. Unlike Western exploitation, China and Africa's relationship is about fair exchange.  It is BUSINESS. But hey, that is not a familiar term to any one from the West wrt Africa.

348 2018-08-19 09:46:39 I really appreciate your entrepreneurship efforts here. You guys are indeed trying and promoting SMEs. On the other hand, the prices of some of the commodities you sell are absurd and exorbitant.

351 2018-08-19 09:31:03 Outlook for SEA nations going forward:

1. Global demand moderates, slower growth
2. Price of commodities that are sensitive to global growth could ease.
3. Tightening of global financial conditions, pressure on currencies & asset markets
4. Likely to do better than other EMs.

357 2018-08-19 09:12:12 I also expect a lower USD helping commodities. When the next recession comes the FED will prob lower rates
358 2018-08-19 09:10:35 Commodities prices were 3 times higher pre and post 2008 equities market correction. AU$ 105.00 US$
359 2018-08-19 09:09:37 Hi. Usually commodities rise late in the cycle before a recession. And I feel that they MIGHT outperform in this next cycle. The could fall a bit but I think less than consumer discretionary for example
360 2018-08-19 09:07:55 Farage, a former commodities broker, twice told the world on election night that Leave had most likely lost the referendum, when he had information suggesting his side had actually won. Hedge fund managers & currency speculators made £billions in short-term bets that night.
361 2018-08-19 09:04:51 Hi, one question. I saw you are positive on commodities. Prob of recession may be rising according to this chart, then how do you think commodities might perform in a recession? It’s one of the risks with the long commodities trade IMO
362 2018-08-19 08:53:40 Health is NOT a good like other commodities that you subject to the normal market forces of supply n demand unless you are a dye in the wool neoliberalist.

364 2018-08-19 08:34:19 I and my generation  benefited from d 'essential commodities'.FYI  THOSE were  goods seized by govt from those hoarding it for d price to skyrocket. Those seized goods were sold to d masses by Buhari govt for give away prices. If u were not born, u shd ve for facts.

366 2018-08-19 08:26:22 There are some advantages of a low pound for exports and tourism and labour but imports become more expensive and basic commodities such as food cost more, disproportionately hitting the less well off.
Brexit is about making the rich richer and it will not reverse Tory austerity.
367 2018-08-19 08:12:20 And these figures are from Pune (A software industry metropolitan city). Commodities are cheaper in suburban and rural areas.
368 2018-08-19 08:04:45 The M'sian economy has to wean itself off from an over-dependence on commodities! Especially where M'sia is not a 'price fixer' (e.g. oil & gas, crude palm oil etc), but a 'price taker'.

373 2018-08-19 07:03:02 A lot of women are not only souvenirs but gift items. They lack self-respect and that's what makes most men see this women these days as commodities to be traded. I don't really blame men who reason in that manner cos the type of girls one sees these days are something else.

403 2018-08-19 03:44:12 This is the result of wage rises. How else can employers pay their employees the wage rises without raising the prices of their commodities. Wages rise is not good for families with dependents and pensioners. Very good for Labor. Keeps them in power

423 2018-08-19 00:05:48 Could be true in commodities with large capital expenditure upfront with production in distant future, e.g. oil drilling rig that goes ahead if future price is locked. Not true in BTC because of dynamic difficulty adjustment (can't predict future production output).

465 2018-08-17 21:42:52 Aos mercenários em geral: a economia sempre andou sozinha, sem depender de governo algum nesse país. Quando os preços das commodities subiram, fez-se o milagre, que o presidiário tratou de dizer que foi feito dele. Quando tudo despencou, já sabemos o resultado.
466 2018-08-17 21:38:28 National Crisis Management Committee to scale up relief and rescue operations in flood-hit #Kerala by involving three defence services and other agencies, besides providing essential commodities to marooned people in 14 worst-affected districts.
467 2018-08-17 21:30:19 QE has been killing commodities with central banks committed to sustaining global paper wealth. The long-term consequences on this sector are damaging without changes in the near-term.
468 2018-08-17 21:29:09 ...e também o fato de que o país não desperdiçou, como outros países, os anos de alta de preços das commodities. ..
469 2018-08-17 21:24:55 If we have bankers invest in commodities with high values, and we sell false commodities at low price to our mates; we can crash system. There is NO System! #StockMarket
470 2018-08-17 21:13:47 Solta o cara pô, a China prometeu que se soltar ele vai rolar um novo ciclo de commodities o BNDES vai abrir a carteira pra geral
471 2018-08-17 21:13:41 Remains to be seen if this is going to be a sustained rally or just another fake out for commodities. Added to some of my positions today as most look extremely oversold. Going to avoid the highest risk names until we get a sense of direction and going to keep the buys small.
472 2018-08-17 21:05:18 Possibility of Trump going for a good Mexico deal he can use as a template for negotiating w/ rest of the world occurred to me during a bullshit session w/ a commodities trader who was my seat neighbor on a recent inter-continental flight...
473 2018-08-17 21:04:59 Saddle-shaped rice-adulterated potato chips in a tennis ball can become valuable commodities on airplanes. On an endless flight they’d be currency, like prison cigarettes.
474 2018-08-17 21:02:05 Hi Fred...having traded commodities for nearly 30 years I remember the old days when big CTAs & guys like Tudor, Caxton, Moore Cap would be licking their chops at squeezing the shorts, especially in Tokyo hours. Never forget how tiny the Au market is and how easy it is to squeeze

481 2018-08-17 20:49:45 We ate cocoyam as breakfast,lunch and dinner. We took our bath and wash our cloth with "soda soap" & essential commodities like milk,sugar & rice was beyond the reach on avarage families after NPN ruined the economy.
It was @MBuhari that made us took our bath again with lux soap
482 2018-08-17 20:42:48 right. or that freedom is freedom to sell commodities, including labor, or that endless “growth” is a good in itself or the market exchange value of a thing is the proper measure of everything.
483 2018-08-17 20:42:00 Ahora vamos barranca abajo y no saben como pararlo...

484 2018-08-17 20:41:35 siamo in una economia di mercato. le capre sono commodities
485 2018-08-17 20:38:12 We literally produce enough food to feed everyone twice over and throw out nearly half of it. We build in planned obsolescence to get people to re-buy commodities and devices that are built with precocious resources. We tear down forests and destroy habitats because its cheaper.
486 2018-08-17 20:37:59 (1/2) Apparently none of the gold longs have noticed the decade-long head and shoulders pattern that was just broken in gold/silver and other commodities. Also ignoring the real-yield problem which is only growing with fed hiking more and inflation heading the other way.

488 2018-08-17 20:16:29 Bros,your head correct! I cant forget how I use to queue at Ring Road in Benin for cheap essential commodities  sold by cheap  @MBuhari & Idiagbon government for d masses.
I laugh when under 30ties of today talk about what they don't know in 1983 & 1984 because of AIT documentry
489 2018-08-17 20:15:13 Despite her recent arm injury, #AmalaPaul along with her family members donated essential commodities in relief camps in and around #Kochi

490 2018-08-17 20:05:46 We want change but we can't take d heat.I've  respected d guy from his stint wt Idiagbon as military govt. Dat was discipline. I remembered d way dy seize hoarded goods & sell it as essential commodities at cheap prices to d masses. It's like we prefer those dt hold us to ransome
491 2018-08-17 20:00:07 El contexto actual multipolar va a contramano de la estrategia adoptada. Y el anterior se durmió en las commodities. Yo creo en lo mismo e insisto que empieza por reforma impositiva, pero los 140 no me alcanzan. En las próximas birras de Acamica amplío (?)
492 2018-08-17 19:57:10 Dejen que hablen fracasados y tontos útiles como éste!Aumenta la realidad de la corrupción, desempleo, pobreza que escondieron y dejaron los K.Lo peor es que con una recaudación histórica por el valor de los commodities y todo el viento a favor en esos oscuros12 años NO VUELVEN+
493 2018-08-17 19:41:30 Acho que o problema é justamente esse. O Brasil é tão ruim que depende das Commodities, se a gente tivesse um direcionamento melhor, poderíamos estar sofrendo menos com as oscilações da mesma.
494 2018-08-17 19:38:09 After reviewing the charts for Cattle & Feeders- I was going to cancel sell orders, but filled on Live cattle. Cancel sell order on Feeders and take profit if lower on Live cattle, or use a tight stop-loss. Stay long Yen. #Agriculture #Commodities #Cattle #Feeders #Forex #Yen
495 2018-08-17 19:35:16 That's true, but there are similarities between farming mammals for their fur and farming them for their flesh in circumstances when these commodities are unnecessary. That is not to say these things are unnecessary for, say, Inuits or Amazonian tribes, but they are for many
496 2018-08-17 19:24:08 Commodities will roar.

500 2018-08-17 19:06:30 For all intents and purposes I think it’s safe to say that personality traits are mental commodities or something like that 
501 2018-08-17 18:48:11 I’m not going to rank somebody above proven commodities off of one season. Especially when I saw somebody else step into that role and win the SB.
502 2018-08-17 18:46:56 Both @FarmFoodCareON & @FoodIntegrityCA have made real progress but they don't have $$ They have independent Cred to spread for all commodities #RealDirt in #newspapers Or @CTV #FieldstoForks on TV

504 2018-08-17 18:45:40 Definitely need to prioritize the line, but draft may not be the answer. @peter_king has written a lot about how drafting OL is a crapshoot now more than ever and I believe gave props to Mac for a clear strategy of only mostly using proven commodities there via free agency.
505 2018-08-17 18:43:26 -Fuel prices expected to hit a new high starting from 1st September. 
-Sugar shortage looms and sugar prices set to rise as the illegal sugar row rages. 
Price of fuel dictates the prices of basic commodities. State of the nation.

KRATOS decentralized commodities trading platform delivers better transparency, higher efficiency, and less complexity, which would result in more timely deliveries and lower cost.
511 2018-08-17 18:29:32 So November meeting with Xi. It would be in Trumps interest to squash beef then, which strengthens Republican Party into midterms. By then we would have a crashed stock market. Last Q of year going to be beautiful for commodities
512 2018-08-17 18:24:53 So disturbed by the way certain YouTubers and bloggers are monetizing their kids. It’s creepy AF. They are not commodities.
513 2018-08-17 18:24:49 Sometimes customers don't buy stuff because commodities are superb,sometimes it's just the customer care that moves a person to purchase
514 2018-08-17 18:20:31 Lula/PT jamais eliminaram a pobreza, apenas e tão somente aproveitaram a bolha de crescimento do Brasil q exportou commodities como nunca devido àquele explosivo crescimento externo, p/ manipular e divulgar dados sociais/econômicos totalmente mentirosos.

What was our debt profile as at May 2015?

What was the figure of forex reserves?
Can you compare the prices of commodities as at that time to 2007?
523 2018-08-17 17:31:33 Its how Bloomberg news filters work on the terminal (well one of the ways anyway) and it’s brilliant - ideally Apple should add more and broader filters (like indices/commodities/topics) and should be able to charge subscription on it

531 2018-08-17 17:11:02 Well that's honest. But their form of imperialism is fundamentally not that different from today. Whereas now the borders don't change all that much (it's the resources and the commodities that seem to matter) there still is a connection. 

Invasion and monetary/resource gain
532 2018-08-17 17:07:10 Currency is a commodity too. A commodity is something that's explicitly used for trade amongst other commodities.

Crypto currency is not any different. It's just a really complicated algorithmic form of trading.

Its literally just the same thing as other commodities.

536 2018-08-17 16:48:11 We were literally branded commodities when we were brought here. A commodity is raw material that can be bought and sold. We run, hoop, catch, bat, sing, rap, for them. Their news is all about us. It’s high time the “Commodity” see their value.

563 2018-08-17 15:04:43 That’s all great but, it doesn’t stop them, and consequently other women,  from being seen as commodities by the people who frequent their places of work. If sex workers think they can get around that because THEY don’t see themselves that way, they’re living in denial.
564 2018-08-17 14:50:56 Absolute tosh! Go back to counting your millions, dear. Some of us remember lies told in the 1970s; the betrayal of our Commonwealth partners; sympathise with the damaged UK Fishing Industry & UK consumers denied cheap food & commodities from outside EU, etc.

576 2018-08-17 13:57:30 GMO’s aren’t inherently bad. Their application is. the problem isn’t the technology. The problem is massive corporations hoarding scientific information because they can profit from marketing the “alternative, healthier” version of commodities.

584 2018-08-17 13:42:48 Hyperinflation will pump the crypto market. That’s why the BTC ETF is likely to get approved. If the price of essential commodities e.g. food and fuel go up too high, it will lead to unrest. Cryptos are a great opportunity to “hide” the real inflation from over-printing $s

590 2018-08-17 13:05:20 Stop defining commodities as human rights. This opens the door to people using force to obtain them.

685 2018-08-17 03:49:30 + federal hemp legalization getting into the upcoming US farm bill will cause a global wave of international commerce and legalizations. Hemp will be a traded alongside wheat/corn sooner than we think (& when was the last time the was a huge "disrupter" w/in commodities sector?)
686 2018-08-17 03:35:19 Here’s the Truth!
As Interest Rates, Continue to Rise—The Dollar, Growth Stocks & Bond Yields—Will Also Continue to Rise—As Bond Prices & Commodities ( Gold, Oil, Corn Etc..) Continue to Fall!

687 2018-08-17 03:30:27 Everything about that looks so good. Tile laying route-building puzzle? Commodities markets? Player boards for presumably nefarious purposes?
688 2018-08-17 03:22:08 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them

693 2018-08-17 02:58:58 Right on. 

It’s so deflating how truth and objectivity are such rare commodities 
694 2018-08-17 02:23:25 Money is simply a commodity used to trade. Other commodities have been used in the past and will continue to be used

698 2018-08-17 02:07:41 will collaborate to overthrow the socialist movement and shaun upon in the new society. All while some country, other than America, is benefiting from the increasing need of commodities bought directly from the US government or luxuries that the US no longer makes.
699 2018-08-17 02:06:14 Your fear of life without drugs leads you to fear a future without capitalist commodities.
700 2018-08-17 02:00:44 Yeah I try not to speculate too far or dig too deep until the bull case actually comes to fruition on the chart. Refuse to lose any more money going long anything gold related. Commodities aren't bullish *yet* and that's that. Nothing bullish about gdx literally at all
701 2018-08-17 01:51:24 Yep agree on the volatility of performance. Does volatility mean country is worth 70% less? Does it present an argument for scale for cheaper land & storing commodities for lean times?? Dunno. Analysis on GM’s but also business performance would help answer. I don’t have time.
702 2018-08-17 01:49:47 Nicolás Mayer Wolf y su equipo con este lanzamiento están revolucionando la manera de hacer negocios de commodities agrícolas en el mundo  @agree_market
703 2018-08-17 01:48:07 None of those demonstrate that he’s anti sex workers. Just that he’s anti women being treated as sexual commodities.
704 2018-08-17 01:46:33 It's really very sad that we are still treated as commodities & not getting proper help from authorities in need of time.
705 2018-08-17 01:43:21 Christie ended up at the end being a fool. However, he looks great compared to the current progressive liberal. New Jersey better wake up. Over taxed for the value of commodities received.
706 2018-08-17 01:41:33 "The U.S. Agriculture Department is projecting farm net income of $59.5 billion this year, the lowest since 2006."
Soybean futures down 14% since China proposed response tariffs in April, following thru in July.

Trump & advisers not reading USDA projections Commodities mrkts?
707 2018-08-17 01:40:02 In the future data may be  important than anything. Datum's technology allows  to securely and anonymously backup structured data from social networks, smart homes, and other IoT devices. 
It creates a global data exchange by turning data into tradeable commodities. #datumnetwork
708 2018-08-17 01:35:55 @TodasLasVoces4 casi 15 años de gobiernos progresistas con commodities a precios récord y todavía no han podido de sacar a la gente de la pobreza ? Será q los quieren tanto o habrán fracasado como dijo Talvi ?
709 2018-08-17 01:34:20 TG, thanks for the optimism in your note... food is one of my 4 megatrends with the others being Water, Precious Metals and Energy -(mega trend commodities). I look forward to a really significant and sustained run for this company that has clearly entered the growth stage.
710 2018-08-17 01:28:12 As a person who was registered in 1969, in securities and commodities, and still active, and follow the wise and wonderfully girted and funny @karenfinerman I agree.
711 2018-08-17 01:21:01 We fully support the #YesOrNo campaign. Actors are not just commodities to be treated with disdain. They are people with hopes, dreams and unquenchable passion 
712 2018-08-17 01:17:01 Inflasi turun Krn biaya logistik turun. akibat infrastruktur  dan efek pemerataan harga BBM,semen , turut berperan.Cara mudah menaikan pertumbuhan mulai membenahi pasar property dan pariwisata Krn multiplier besar. Kmrn meneruskan shifting dari commodities ke industrial based.
713 2018-08-17 01:11:58 What happened with commodities oil, gold and sugar.  We crushed Cuba’s sugar prices right? IDK.
714 2018-08-17 01:10:20 Now move 75 percent of your holdings to commodities and bonds if you would like to stay a millionaire past the next recession.
715 2018-08-17 01:06:04 For YA mentors- I know many have stated wanting nothing to do w/ sexual assault. My MS is in the vein of Handmaid's Tale & Harlots, and deals w/ women's bodies sold as commodities. While nothing is explicit, such themes are suggested. Would this be a no-go? #pitchwars #AskMentor

719 2018-08-17 00:38:50 Artists are mgmt commodities/products. They'll be sold in the packaging & terms favorable sa business. Some are promoted as SOLO dahil naniniwala ang mgt na kya nila..& others w/ ka LT dhil mas mgiging sobrang lakas llo na sa abroad pg joint force fanbases.
720 2018-08-17 00:09:32 Most advisors reccomend you have some money socked away in gold and commodities. I don't see why putting a small percentage of your wealth in bitcoin is unreasonable.
721 2018-08-17 00:09:21 Check out Poverty, Inc documentary on Amazon Prime. Talks about the big business of NGO’s and how Free commodities help surpress domestic economic development in poor countries. Essentially keeping poor people in natural resource rich countries dependent
722 2018-08-17 00:06:36 .@SecretaryZinke’s suggestions are crap.

Our #wildlife & wild lands are not commodities
to be sold off to the highest bidder.

Also, #Zinke @SecretarySonny @DOIDepSec:
KEEP OUT OF #California.
