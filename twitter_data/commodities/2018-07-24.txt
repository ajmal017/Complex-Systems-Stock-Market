4 2018-07-24 23:40:54 @realDonaldTrump @brithume @BretBaier if Administration subsidy to farmers $12 Billion can’t we appropriate part of farm commodities to our +$41 Billion in foreign aid ? Seems plausible to LDC n emerging countries.
5 2018-07-24 23:39:24 By the time tRUMP thinks he has straightened everything out, all the buyers of farm commodities would have already found different sellers of those same products. Partnerships it took years to foster and maintain. tRUMP Fucked US big time!

7 2018-07-24 23:36:19 The tarrifs are on stolen tech from China not some simple commodities. Out of the two countries between China and USA the one that exports the most loses. China can’t afford that much imports from USA every yr.
8 2018-07-24 23:31:38 Most inflation in low-inflation countries is commodities, yes. But price-wage spirals are routine in stagflation and hyperinflation.
9 2018-07-24 23:26:45 Remember in 1984 they also controlled the Commodities.
10 2018-07-24 23:24:19 Commodities markets are a strange beast. It’s reasonable to have some stop gaps b/c when you go into farming and ranching for a living you are basically gambling for living. Selling this years goods to pay for last years line of credit. Bankers will love you, until they don’t.
11 2018-07-24 23:22:50 I'm going to start researching commodities stock...
12 2018-07-24 23:22:24 Have traveled other countries. 
America ain’t that great. We have super quick access to all these commodities brought to us by capitalism. That’s about all it’s come down to. Tell me how wonderful and fair our government and policing systems are... please. Equality? I’ll wait.
13 2018-07-24 23:21:13 Remember in 1984 they also controled the commodities.

17 2018-07-24 23:14:08 Look at the price of wheat over the last 30 to 40 years. Compare that to the price of farm equipment in that same time frame. Commodities produced by farmers, in general have got left behind.

36 2018-07-24 23:13:58 I guess it'll be good to be running a food pantry relying on federal commodities. Which I am.
But, as usual, even better to be a hog at the agribusiness trough.
37 2018-07-24 23:13:06 It's a good thing to do temporarily until the market for Farm commodities become stable again.
38 2018-07-24 23:09:42 These people are human beings too, not commodities and the sooner they realise to love and take care of themselves, the happier they’ll be! Their companies care about the next big thing, the managers about recognition but who cares about the stars? Shame
39 2018-07-24 23:09:08 Trump has no clue about farm commodities. America will be bumped out of the soybean market in China. Corn is over saturated and more expensive to grow. A one year bailout won’t solve next year’s problem.
40 2018-07-24 23:08:00 Jezzus $12billion, you know CCC has to sell those commodities sometime, in the meantime guess who pays the storage bill, that’s right, you do,
41 2018-07-24 23:06:23 Commodities are the opium of the people.
42 2018-07-24 22:50:44 That's backwards. Crypto is the new "commodity."  Commodities been mooning and crashing since forever.  :)
43 2018-07-24 22:42:31 Trump trade policy explained: 
Break existing agreements, negotiate 1-on-1 on all commodities in a way that benefits your cronies & political supporters; interfere with free markets & pick winners and losers; and bribe specific constituencies with government aid to buy votes.
44 2018-07-24 22:33:22 Multiple factors at play. Do you count the costs saved by having people die on waiting lists? Look at commodities where free markets allowed to operate. They tend toward lower costs.
45 2018-07-24 22:26:49 .@chrishayes. The Secretary has broad authority under the Commodty Credit Corporation (CCC) Charter Act, passed in 1948, to draw on funds directly from the Treasury to provide help to producers of certain commodities.
46 2018-07-24 22:26:21 All public are willing to know exact the imposing tax on the commodities importing/exporting to and from territories. Either isn’t it fake news or true? you would be voiced in constitutional assembly.
47 2018-07-24 22:17:35 Yes, such change. So much winning that we, the taxpayers, have to cover the cost of the tariffs on ag commodities. Yay us!
48 2018-07-24 22:15:24 Adama Barrow of The Gambia. We don’t need mosques at the moment. We are starving sir I beg reduce the price of rice and other food commodities. Build school, give scholarships to the needy, and elevate our health sector @Presidency_GMB @AmieBSissoho
49 2018-07-24 22:14:22 As both a farmer and crop insurance provider, I've generally not liked handouts/subsidies. I'd prefer the govmt financed research for additional uses of commodities, subsidize other countries with commodities rather than cash, invest in trade relations to drive demand higher.

52 2018-07-24 22:09:59 Oh. The "Trump Tariffs" now require $12B in SUBSIDIES. Since when do we ask such sacrifice from farmers? They can't feed their families & the @POTUS asks for patience. Ag commodities tanking!  Dude (Excuse me. Mr. President). You'd BETTER be right! @radioguycliff @VanceGinn
53 2018-07-24 22:09:40 Not a good sign on Nasdaq but emerging markets and commodities did well. Maybe a rotation?

58 2018-07-24 21:45:43 One of the symptoms of an economy reliant on commodities. Bank don't care to do hard work of investing.. Easier to lobby for govt portfolio and get involved in commodity trading. Little incentive to do real banking work.
59 2018-07-24 21:41:02 Nafta is cool but it did have some serious issues as well as really good points so I hope we keep the good and change the bad. I do wish he would shutup sometimes on commodities but only cuz my money is at stake.
60 2018-07-24 21:38:21 Que hubiese sido de nestor sin las lluvias, la suba de precios en commodities.. tuvo la misma suerte q menem en la segunda mitad de los 90’s , pero se murió antes de cagarla
61 2018-07-24 21:35:36 Religion scholar K. Lofton has a great chapter ("Sacrificing Britney") critiquing our celeb/media culture's cyclical, sacrificial use of young pop starlets as commodities. 

The chapter ends with a suggestion that #DemiLovato may be next on the altar of our vampiric consumption.
62 2018-07-24 21:34:18 it was almost only exclusively "consumed" by the rich. Capitalism and consumerism see art as commodities and the current version of both involves extreme levels of entitlement to consume "goods" immediately not because of need but because of want. Still makes piracy stealing 'tho
63 2018-07-24 21:32:12 Could happen. Yes, approval of the Direxion ETF would be a positive sign for VanEck/SolidX (though not a guarantee). There are key differences between the futures and commodities markets, but approval of Direxion would signal SEC confidence in the maturity of bitcoin generally.
64 2018-07-24 21:27:12 Some questions for the USDA on the plan to spend $12 billion in relief for farmers hit by Trump's trade war:
- Will corporate owners not actively involved in farming qualify?
- What will happen to the purchased surplus commodities?
65 2018-07-24 21:09:03 It won't be farmer Bob getting the cash. This is just more corporate welfare for "Big Ag" & price support for commodities speculators
66 2018-07-24 21:07:05 2- A maior parte das pessoas que melhoraram as condições de vida naquele período, o fizeram de forma artificiosa. Sobretudo através de programas de transferência de renda, desvalorização do dólar no período Obama e aumento do preço das commodities.
67 2018-07-24 21:00:28 Instead of paying farm corps to not grow crops in order to lower supply relative to demand, the government should purchase those commodities at the lowest reasonable market rate and then distribute them charitably or, where appropriate, to school lunch programs.
68 2018-07-24 21:00:00 Most of the commodities green today. Expect a smooth ride today for the miners on the ASX
69 2018-07-24 20:59:22 Will the funds going to the farmers, to offset the effects of the tariffs,  lower the prices of commodities used by the consumers?
70 2018-07-24 20:58:42 But nothing moves natural gas prices with futures contracts attached nationally. That is how markets actually should move when their is fear of shortages. War on commodities continues.
71 2018-07-24 20:54:04 In God's economy people are commodities.  We "invest" in people and they better give us a return on investment or we cut our losses and move on.  #theology
72 2018-07-24 20:53:34 Bomb foreign countries to steal their commodities it’s the only reason, right right?!
73 2018-07-24 20:45:38 As a farmer, we need to stop the tarrifs, stop the subsidies and bail outs, & let the free market reign. Spend the money on opening new markets, marketing  commodities worldwide. Create demand. Create alternative uses for our soil to curb oversupply. That's where we should put $

76 2018-07-24 20:33:32 Footnote to Step 3; ding social welfare/entitlement programs to "pay" for the damages. Start with SNAP, which has the untoward effect of also reducing demand for damaged commodities.
77 2018-07-24 20:30:17 The Administration’s trade actions have made it even more difficult for family farmers to sell their crops and make ends meet. My bill would provide a permanent fix for farmers to stay competitive while they find new markets to sell their crops and commodities. #DontHarmTheFarm
78 2018-07-24 20:27:57 Hey @TeamHeinrich, how does this coincide with the USDA "America's Harvest Box" program? Looks like they are announcing a chunk of money for purchasing commodities to send to food banks. Remember the harvest box?
79 2018-07-24 20:23:55 . Talk it up Ken. Speculation is hurting us all. Including those less fortunate. I live by where you work. I interact with many in the area. Market RE and current state only divide us further. RE as commodities are doing that.
80 2018-07-24 20:18:08 How did ‘murica get to be number 1? By making oil dollar deniminated and lending ever country dollars to pay back loans used to buy their commodities.... sound familiar? I mean give the chinese credit for (unlike us) taking a good strategy and making it theirs!
81 2018-07-24 20:13:21 The details are still coming out but I’m assuming the government will “buy” some commodities like a stockpile.   It’s not good any way.  A massive subsidy payout like this throws everything out of whack for the market.
82 2018-07-24 20:12:59 I mean...Hillary in her own book admitted that something like Medicare for All was a pony dream, that $15 min wage would be too unrealistic to pass. It's Democrats that are responsible for NAFTA, Telecomms Act, Commodities Futures Modernization Act, Graham Bliely,China WTO
83 2018-07-24 20:11:53 They are in way over their head. The HFT War on commodities destroys producers investors while helping Fed/Treasury/Banks.  Farmers, miners, investors, oil industry are big losers. Was hoping @realDonaldTrump would stop it but he is embracing the power at the expense of his base.
84 2018-07-24 20:05:26 The graphite twins continue to allure me with upside despite missing it initially. But unsure of the commodity and its dynamics. Also acutely aware of the fickle nature of commodities and its connectedness to global factors.Not invested , not my #circleofcompetence
85 2018-07-24 20:03:18 Uncut diamonds are one of the most value-dense commodities there is, and of the correct size and quality, are virtually impossible to trace.
86 2018-07-24 20:01:33 Is it even research if it doesn't produce commodities? 

Applied research is great, but with such a difficult funding environment for basic res, what will be left to apply?!
87 2018-07-24 20:01:32 Think this reflects worse on the state of English football rather than Scottish.

You are all treated as commodities.
88 2018-07-24 20:00:50 All work treats human bodies as commodities that can be paid for like objects. You don't think the people going blind in sulfur mines are selling their bodies?
89 2018-07-24 20:00:43 you’re not factoring in who buys from other countries that are now selling their commodities to China.  International commodity trading is massively complex.   Trump did the right thing in calling out China for their trade,but he completely botched the method of negotiating.
90 2018-07-24 19:59:56 Yield curve flattening resumed today, commodities finished well off the highs, NASDAQ got sumped intraday after two strong earnings reports from $MSFT and $GOOGL in consecutive days.  And the Russell ran into resistance at 1700
91 2018-07-24 19:53:22 When is the last time a farmer or coop farmers group felt like they had any control over the market prices !?!Wall Street has taken that control away with the commodities exchange and trade deficits combined !! Eliminating trade deficits will give the farmers more control again !
92 2018-07-24 19:42:26 When are they going reduce the prices of commodities is a more important question!
93 2018-07-24 19:34:41 “And it’ll all be paid for through more deficit spending, after the $1.5 Trillion in deficits we just created by cutting taxes on the people who trade on your commodities that you can’t sell.”
94 2018-07-24 19:33:24 The question is how long will it take before EVs are commodities? The entire interim, Tesla will be eating market share and expanding margins. 'Just' another Toyota would still be a huge win. Doesn't justify their current share price but so what?
95 2018-07-24 19:32:12 ESP if your company deals in international commodities which is almost every major business
96 2018-07-24 19:32:01 Deng and Noah will never fade into obscurity.  If they want the adulation, they can live in Chicago & receive love for the rest of their lives.  Or they can get in the gym and try to salvage the last 2 years on the most precious of all sports commodities, a guaranteed contract.
97 2018-07-24 19:30:57 It could very well be lost forever.  We are not the only producer of these commodities.   Add to this the general breaking of ties with other nations, and the future for us who farm is uncertain.

I have no sympathy for those who voted for Trump and still support him.
98 2018-07-24 19:23:54 Security clearances r commodities that allow ppl to gain financially?! If that's their thought process then they should absolutely have them yanked. Financial penalty....give me a freaking break. They've made enough $ selling the country out.
99 2018-07-24 19:20:12 If the tariff were not applied on the countries then they would have to impose even more taxes and commodities becomes more expensive for there own people. Trade deficits had to be balanced for better relationships with everyone in near future.
100 2018-07-24 19:16:17 Stockpiling by industry will then be a commercial matter, and result in much higher prices for "scarce" products - such as the most basic living commodities.
101 2018-07-24 19:15:19 Then economically where are you heading as a nation? if commodities are high the  poor can’t afford then what will their hope
102 2018-07-24 19:14:12 @KenDilanianNBC So security clearances are not given to allow holders to engage in government activities but they are commodities? Are you stupid or just a biased hack? Perhaps both. Holding a clearance should bar the holder from media jobs.
103 2018-07-24 19:13:06 They're commodities? Where can I buy one?
104 2018-07-24 19:12:32 I see that. But do you think its possible that by inhibiting a p2p marketplace to thrive on its own, that we are capping the emergence of some economic activity? or efficiency?

im looking at data bundles as a digital commodity. in the real world, commodities can trade freely
105 2018-07-24 19:10:51 In fact given that many food commodities are cheaper outside the EU than within we might end up seeing a fall in prices.

107 2018-07-24 19:07:29 True and agreed. So how do we get to TRUE free market and free trade to have equal playing field on commodities when other countries are heavily subsidized or our products have larger tariffs put on them?
108 2018-07-24 19:04:55 O/N Wrap:
A reasonably positive evening for markets - equities skewed higher on solid corporate earnings and gains in commodities; broad commodity rally driven by China stimulus proposals;  #AUD outperformance + static #NZD (0.6800 remains focal point) = dip in #NZDAUD.
109 2018-07-24 19:04:32 Commodities are fungible. US farmers should be looking to poach markets from the Brazilians or any other nation the Chinese are considering as alternatives. Of course, Chinese exporters have no real alternatives to our markets. Edge: US.
110 2018-07-24 19:04:05 I can appreciate that but also consider that a majority of people require free transport of energy and other commodities for the transition of our economy as it shifts greatly over the next decade. We have the most engineers per capita in NA and billions going into green tech.
111 2018-07-24 19:03:30 Yes, let's fight communism by having the central government purchase our commodities.
112 2018-07-24 19:02:30 To be honest Britain being unable to feed itself shaped the world,eg New Zealand's lamb & Argentina's beef industries were created to meet our demand, it's also why refrigerated shipping came in. Also the commodities markets were invented by us buying grain from Canada and Russia
113 2018-07-24 18:52:55 30-40 partidos, um "louco" na presidência de uma "República Presidencialista" sem nenhuma base parlamentar, não há bolha de commodities que sustenta....a probabilidade é que tudo desabe em 12-24 meses
114 2018-07-24 18:47:53 DONE. Easy money. Ag commodities are COMMODITIES. Unless China tariffs effect GLOBAL supply & demand there will be no sustained effect on prices save for some transition costs and frictions. Brazil bean costs up / US bean costs down / Brazil buyers switch to US -> equilibration

118 2018-07-24 18:36:14 America is such a poor country we can’t afford these commodities like healthcare for everyone like other developed countries have! I’m getting anxious just thinking about it, we have endless wars to be in and banks and corporations to horde money instead!!

123 2018-07-24 18:23:09 Time and time I have heard farmers want to dump taxpayer subsidized commodities on poor countires who's majority of their work force is employed in the agricultural industry,  destroying their livelihood and thus monopolizing the market. :ex. Haiti and Mexico.
124 2018-07-24 18:23:09 Did you know that when the border was closed goods and commodities were smuggled through the borders of neighbouring countries into Nigeria and they still paid duties to neighbouring countries at an even more expensive rate
125 2018-07-24 18:22:08 Yep!! Farmers don’t want a handout. Let us sell our commodities!
126 2018-07-24 18:21:06 Lula pegou o país na crise do segundo mandato do FHC. Tenho idade suficiente para ter conhecido de perto os governos desde a redemocratização. Ele teve sim o benefício da alta das commodities, mas seu projeto levou o Brasil à sexta economia mundial e nos tirou do mapa da fome
127 2018-07-24 18:16:03 Market facilitation program payments, direct payments, will be made when harvest is complete for various commodities (not sure on dairy and pork), ie wheat is done so those producers will receive payments sooner.
128 2018-07-24 18:15:15 Calmness and peace of mind are two very important commodities in life
129 2018-07-24 18:13:51 which directly control who plants what and where, as well as who has access to that what. There's a reason commodities are so cheap and we are so addicted to foods that are made of them – federal subsidies.
130 2018-07-24 18:13:09 yep, i havent seen all details but i imagine they would be focusing on the hardest hit ag commodities which soybeans would be near the top. Dont know but to me it signals a long term trade stance by the administration.

132 2018-07-24 18:10:27 How many of those presidents were president when black people were still tradeable commodities? Don't really think that argument holds up. 

It's not about 'this black man is a millionaire = racism is solved' it's about years of systematic white preference that's still going
133 2018-07-24 18:06:19 There's nothing revolutionary about doing drugs, they make you addicted to capitalist commodities.
134 2018-07-24 18:02:17 I don’t think so, in full force, quite yet, but as demand slows due to tarriffs all agricultural commodities will feel it.
135 2018-07-24 18:01:13 Using surplus commodities to supply those who lack the means to provide for themselves? What kinda commie pinko bullshit is this?

152 2018-07-24 17:19:26 American taxpayers paying tax dollars to farmers in so that they can then pay more for commodities. Making America Great Again one tariff at a time.
153 2018-07-24 17:16:07 "American farm subsidies are egregiously expensive, harvesting $20 billion a year from taxpayers' pockets. Most of the money goes to big, rich farmers producing staple commodities such as corn and soyabeans in states such as Iowa." - The Economist, 2/15
154 2018-07-24 17:14:35 They come over with produce and other commodities and dropped off in the GTA. It’s insane. We need stronger checks at the border but of course they don’t want to tie up the borders so “move along”.
155 2018-07-24 17:02:41 Electricity is the biggest driver of manufacturing, with no power to drive processing industries, there would be no jobs and processed commodities for the Kenyan populace to consume and export, 
meaning the economy would collapse

156 2018-07-24 17:02:36 F it. Let’s all go broke and not raise any food. Commodity prices have been cut 1/2-2/3 what they were 5 years ago. The inputs to raise commodities have dropped 1/4-1/3 of what they were. So as you can see it’s a profitable time in farming....not
157 2018-07-24 17:02:34 This is going to be boom for commodities’ futures.
158 2018-07-24 17:02:00 He seems to be attacking what Adam Smith and David Ricardo originally recommended: to import commodities whenever they are cheaper to buy than to make.

160 2018-07-24 16:56:08 For an excellent precursor - explaining history through six commodities - see Henry Hobhouse’s 1985 Seeds of Change.

162 2018-07-24 16:54:33 It is 5th day of transport strike starting from 20th July. Surprisingly 1st time in free India, It is not reported in any media as it should be. Is censorship is so strong with this government. Essential commodities and medicine too are not getting transported.
163 2018-07-24 16:50:28 Marketing assistance loans for commodities are non-recourse because the commodity is pledged as loan collateral and producers have the option of delivering the pledged collateral to the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) in satisfaction of the repayment of the outstanding loan
164 2018-07-24 16:49:18 I agree with your statement but if the other countries are putting tariffs on our Ag commodities how are we to compete?
165 2018-07-24 16:46:42 I have a hunch that this reference works better with farmers than others (both because of commodities connections and because of dust bowl stories), but I have zero evidence of this.

170 2018-07-24 16:17:09 Throughout the history, poor people ate the discarded pieces of the rich people. However, poor people found ways to make them edible & taste good.
Today butchers hold them valuable commodities.

175 2018-07-24 16:04:46 Lot easier than finding a market, especially for corporate agri-business. Question: what did the commodities futures do during this time? Was this anticipated/leaked?
176 2018-07-24 16:01:44 CBO says higher tariffs will cause loss of export sales and loss of jobs. Higher tariffs fix nothing. They create more problems, look around at soybean, corn, pork, wheat and other commodities have plunged. How does that help the nation?

178 2018-07-24 16:00:26 No borders, no tariffs, same language, same currency, free movement of services, of people, of goods, of commodities, of labour. How is this NOT a free market?
179 2018-07-24 15:58:52 These people aren't farmers! They are commodities producers. They grow inedible crops! The government doesn't help farmers that produce food for their local communities. Most of your food is imported because it's cheaper to grow in warmer climates.
180 2018-07-24 15:52:08 We're just feeding our local communities, so we mean nothing to the Federal government. They only care about commodities. That's why farmer's markets don't get shit for help while row croppers sit in temp controlled combines raking in cash!

192 2018-07-24 15:23:57 Syndicalism basically advocates for workers self-managed capitalism where democratic co-ops take the place of corporations in producing/exchanging commodities with other co-ops that then distribute the value they accumulate to the workers in the individual co-op they work in.

198 2018-07-24 15:12:45 I get your point.  It would be the same rate, however.  It is a matter of disposible income, which is what it is now.  I prefer a flat tax, but nobody can hide from an all inclusive sales tax.  We could make it lower on commodities.

China and Canada aren’t paying those tariffs to us.  We’re paying higher prices for goods and commodities than we were before.  Sad.  So sad.

256 2018-07-24 12:13:21 How can we expect that somehow, by legalising prostitution, attitudes of these men will change for the better. Today, the very demand for prostitutes are driven by the idea that women are commodities. Making it lawful allows men to perpetuate the subordination of women.

264 2018-07-24 11:32:33 Oh noes!!!!  Commodities went way up last year after a massive hurricane pushed supplies down and now that they’re at normal production levels, the price corrected?
Yeah, that’s called “the market”.
265 2018-07-24 11:31:24 Silver is just as good as Gold. There is "more silver" than gold, but its what 10:1 40:1? still scarce.

But both Gold & Silver will become commodities when graphene desalination plants become a reality. #bitcoin will be the only hard money when that happens.

274 2018-07-24 10:52:34 A dullard or shit knows the difference between a dollar exchange effect and an OPEC effect.

308 2018-07-24 08:09:33 These barrages of increases directly affect the price of food, and the poor now have to pay more for basic commodities to survive.

359 2018-07-24 02:59:44 Most of the screeching about revoking security clearances is bound to be from people who have one and are afraid of losing it or people who hope to have a high enough one to cash in some day. People have been posting today that they are "commodities" and tickets to jobs. Corrupt.

361 2018-07-24 02:30:23 Okay. Would you like all products from China banned in our country and have people only buy American? No we want fair trade. Only certain commodities where we don't have a fair trade have tariffs. It makes sense to balance trade. Overegulation caused this. Trump removed many.
362 2018-07-24 02:22:59 What are we: commodities?
363 2018-07-24 02:01:14 And how do you ensure that unification? Even prisons have economic inequality. People always hoard and trade commodities, and the people who are the best at it generate wealth from it.
364 2018-07-24 01:45:44 I’ve nudged our community to behave like a “real” commodities market. It’s worked.

368 2018-07-24 01:33:19 I don't see how that will be possible if Uncle Sam keeps busting balls of the Russian dudes who own commodities export businesses. Most teams are operating at a loss and only owners vanity keeps them afloat.
369 2018-07-24 01:23:00 Yuan looks to be controlling all commodities. Not doing a good job on equities though.
370 2018-07-24 00:56:28 The entirety of fantasy football is predicated on gazing into the crystal ball and making educated predictions. Hard to win or acquire  commodities at a value when you have to see someone “prove it”. Some of these dolts truly don’t get it.
371 2018-07-24 00:53:09 Indeed so. Applicable to stocks and crypto i.e. assets where the majority of investors have a long bias. Currencies don't have bottoms and tops, just extremes. For commodities it varies greatly though are prone to similar patterns in both directions.

374 2018-07-24 00:32:05 Or I'll try to help if I know anything about the question.  Commodities are fascinating!
375 2018-07-24 00:31:56 Thanks for sharing this Katherine. It is vital that complete trail of vaccines is available for quality assurance. Such commodities are highly perishable and cold chain must be maintained for product to survive.
376 2018-07-24 00:29:18 Such great points. Thank you for sharing! There’s a lot of talk in the legal community about the transmuting of tokens from securities (during ICO) to commodities (after ICO).  Seems to be the emerging standard (for lack of a better word). I agree- xrp is not a security!
377 2018-07-24 00:22:56 I hate the world of Commodities we live in
378 2018-07-24 00:21:32 Jenkins:"Politicians are commodities that are bought by capitalists. Legislation is a commodity that is bought by lobbyists (employed by capitalists). This is the case for both parties and all politicians (because it is built into the system)."
379 2018-07-24 00:20:32 It's a race to the bottom (cost) with everyone being fixated on price. Not a great place to be long term in my view. These things are commodities. They are airlines but with lower barriers to entry
380 2018-07-24 00:15:02 Police shot at Dino’s car, Buba Galadima just had a mysterious car crash. Police have invited Saraki again

U that still support Buhari (while buying commodities at double prices compared to b4 he came amid huge insecurity), u’re not only wicked & callous, u also hate yourself
