38 2018-06-04 21:47:25 Empower yourself by being stronger than the capitalist urge to consume addictive commodities.
39 2018-06-04 21:40:40 Who forced the oil price down and why?commodities can have +/- prices. Oil revenues were caught up in a devious plot targeting ‘others’. Given the revenue contribution to Treasury, it heftily hurt ‘the UK’ and yes, affected projected figures adversely against Scotland’s future.
40 2018-06-04 21:30:21 Looking forward to hear from @AlanBjerga, author of "Endless Appetites: How the Commodities Casino Creates #Hunger and Unrest", on his insights towards "#Feeding the #World in the Era of America First"
41 2018-06-04 21:23:01 He wasn’t that great.  He deregulated banking, media and commodities which has created the problems we now face today.  He “reformed” welfare and criminal justice, which led to more poverty and massive prison populations.  Bill Clinton was nothing but Republican-lite.
42 2018-06-04 21:16:46 When once Congress rosed the price on petrol, diesel, LPG and grocery commodities BJP leaders such @arunjaitleyji, @SushmaSwaraj ji are on strike against but now public on strike when during @BJP4India regime price on petrol,diesel & LPG hike on continuous .
43 2018-06-04 21:16:21 Commodities outperform so far. Any way gj.
44 2018-06-04 21:02:15 That channel also looks like a multi-year bull flag! Also, I think it is better not to club all commodities in one, as there are a few that are clearly risk-off ($GC $CL) vs others that are risk-on ($HG)
45 2018-06-04 20:56:22 In the last economic golden age, most European and Asian nations were still recovering from the Second World War. The USA was not, and we sold a lot of commodities to them. We are not there right now.
46 2018-06-04 20:45:15 That would require thought and intelligence. Rare commodities these days.

48 2018-06-04 20:25:51 The facts do not support your statement. Wedding services are very high-dollar high-profit commodities & most vendors are very willing to serve same sex weddings so if LGBT folks only want to be left alone to live in peace why are they  pursuing Christian bakers/florists/photogs?

52 2018-06-04 19:51:19 Hey #twitterstorians, is there a resource out there online (or elsewhere) that lists the top global commodities by decade???
53 2018-06-04 19:36:39 Prof: let's talk about commodities, like this haircut that no one complimented me on, it's okay it was a few days ago.
54 2018-06-04 19:36:04 Haha yes. Commodities...
55 2018-06-04 19:31:48 Gas prices are controlled by the elites who have invested in oil commodities, futures. They see a booming economy and Americans having more money to spend as an opportunity to charge more thus increasing their profits.That's it, they control the supply and output.
56 2018-06-04 19:22:00 They are blocking our commodities therby fixing prices against our commodities!
57 2018-06-04 19:19:37 You are an idiot.  No country expects a free ride.  It’s call free trade but it’s not free.  Each country exchanges commodities with lower traiffs not NO traiffs.
58 2018-06-04 19:15:17 Começamos pelos mais baratos: Hidroviário e depois ferroviário, rodovia é para curtas distâncias, no caso fazer a ligação dos commodities com os outros modais, mas isso é só no resto do mundo. Por aqui é o mais caro mesmo e só ele, que é pra ser mais radical
59 2018-06-04 19:12:16 If this were *really* a problem, the US government could just subsidize the production of basic commodities
60 2018-06-04 19:10:42 Need to stop talking as steel and aluminum are commodities instead of specific grades for specific engineered products!
61 2018-06-04 19:09:32 I’m right there with you.  He signed the WORST LEGISLATION that has created much of the problems we are currently facing, like the deregulation’s of banking, media and commodities.  Also the dismantling of the welfare system.  He did a LOT of damage from his Republican-lite,
62 2018-06-04 19:04:39 That should be obvious. Such commodities are necessary for items used nationally on a daily basis, but especially in construction of items for national defense. Obviously, the liberals don’t understand this.
63 2018-06-04 18:56:17 One thing that you learn after doing business in commodities for a little while is that people don't care enough about you or what you do. It's your job to constantly remind them that you're amazing and can create things they want!
64 2018-06-04 18:52:38 Beti bhi di nahi jati coz betis r not commodities
65 2018-06-04 18:51:43 Those for prohibitionist drug policy on global commodities deny human nature and the law of Supply and Demand. People have and will always acquire the drugs they wish. The way to influence their choice is through impartial information. Prohibition policies exacerbate harms.
66 2018-06-04 18:50:45 Thanks for the response :) As a DM, do you encounter problems with"fudging" or forgetting inventory, xp, and all other finite commodities? Further, do you feel there is a place for DM regulated character data?
67 2018-06-04 18:40:49 US businesses and consumers will feel a hit by increased prices for Canadian goods, while losing sales & jobs because CDN Counter Tariffs will make high tech items like aircraft purchases, food commodities & other items too expensive, so CDN will buy other nation’s products.

71 2018-06-04 18:27:19 Take note of copper oil traders. When rates rise there’s a high correlation with both commodities especially when they’re in a forecasted growing deficit.
72 2018-06-04 18:19:27 I agree. Beware of manipulated currency comparisons. Comparing tons of commodities & many other products would seem a better measure.

That said, China in "building" stage & has 3x population, so 10/3 = 3.3.

Other than bragging rights, "GDP" & "importance" don't matter.
73 2018-06-04 18:07:36 Willis, obviously I'm aware of GDP stats but, as someone with business experience in commodities, I've long been wary of situations where inconsistency between "GDP" and tonnes of commodity consumption. Is a haircut in US really worth 20 times as much as a haircut in India?
74 2018-06-04 18:07:11 ONE NATION ONE POLL IS A POLITICAL GIMMICK TO DIVERT THE  ATTENTION FROM REAL  ISSUES  LIKE PRICE RICE   OF  FUEL AND ESSENTIAL COMMODITIES, AND TO THWART OPPOSITION UNITY#

Optional of course, but schools have been very good about participation
82 2018-06-04 17:46:27 I appreciate your view from one sideline - from the parent sideline I've seen clubs treat kids like commodities. If the kid is a commodity then the process becomes a market
83 2018-06-04 17:38:19 Ask anyone investing in the futures market (commodities) how much they love Trump's Tariffs. This is the beginning of the Hoover administration all over again. Removed restrictions that helped prevent economic depression.
84 2018-06-04 17:31:31 If only that were true of commodities too. But alas, stuff produced by corporations in a capitalist economy is just for a select few.
85 2018-06-04 17:30:51 Y a contracara del Último cuarto del siglo xx, donde la oferta de commodities superaba a la demanda deprimiendo sus TDI, esta es una nueva etapa en donde los recursos naturales ván a ir ganando peso relativo por sobre las manufacturas industriales al menos hasta 2050 .

90 2018-06-04 17:11:06 Primary market trends so far today centered around U.S. equities notably higher. USD is weaker but commodities aren't following, with cotton, natgas, Brent & WTI crude all down nearly or over 1%. Gold & silver also softer. Cable -0.25%, A$ up 1% on US$.
91 2018-06-04 17:07:35 Big sell off in a lot of commodities this morning, but not Western Canadian diffs. Rallying hard..now up $11.50 to -$14.50/bbl last.

94 2018-06-04 16:54:38 This is why renewables will inevitably win. Their price goes monotonically down, because you can't un-invent technology, so are a reliable bet for future prices. Commodities like oil on the other hand, we can't predict into the middle of the next week.

103 2018-06-04 16:30:57 @AnnaAnnasvahn @TureMasing Hej! Har ni någon läsning att rekommendera när det kommer till commodities? Har precis börjat läsa Hot commodities av Jim Rogers efter att ha blivit inspirerad av er pod.
104 2018-06-04 16:16:55 Beef was sky high a couple of years ago.  WTF is the UMBER moron talking about.  Commodities have gone back and forth.
105 2018-06-04 16:10:03 These are just the commodities Rees Mogg invests in
106 2018-06-04 16:09:13 That is indeed worrisome. Our PM recently indicated that SM was being discussed; sounded like we were perhaps talking concessions of some sort in this arena. Not good, considering what we’ve conceded in the TPP and CETA. Hope our other commodities get the gains they expect.
107 2018-06-04 16:08:52 it has been clear for a few years that if we all just agree that goods & services embodying artistic expression aren't the sort of commodities that might implicate anti-discrimination concerns, then we can all just get along

but some won't settle for less than wild celebration
108 2018-06-04 16:08:14 is this relevant to tariffs?  or just pricing of commodities?

that said, australia has done ok trading iron for electronics/ the associated ip.    a lot depends on relative prices and commodities can be capital intensive and support high wage jobs
115 2018-06-04 15:42:13 Straight to NBA era when drafting unknown kids right out of high school was all the rage was bad for the NBA & CBB.

124 2018-06-04 15:22:23 Exactly who gets hurt?  Explain please. Example, Others need our farm products we need their aluminum, so why shouldn’t the trade tariffs and restrictions be the same on both exports and imports. No one has a monopoly on commodities. Econ 101
125 2018-06-04 15:19:00 Of course, hate, racism, xenophobia, homophobia, Islamophobia, sexism, antisemitism, and political tribalism are the only commodities you are trading. A lot of idiots are willing to buy your crap. But that doesn’t make you smart and worthy!

128 2018-06-04 15:08:37 It's in the commodities for dummies book, just inside the cover, just above the risk and not a get rich quick warning.
129 2018-06-04 15:07:46 Yeah more government regulations on business always works out! We should just have the government take over all of our most profitable commodities as well. I hear it has been working out great for Venezuela.
130 2018-06-04 15:03:07 Two of my office colleague has bought Triveni stock. One of them doesn't know it is sugar stock. Spent time explaining them why random stock buyers can't make money in cyclicals and commodities. Even experienced people hadn't made money in commodities. Hopefully they understood.
131 2018-06-04 15:00:00 So, apparently higher prices for the world-wide consumers because of tariffs (trade wars) negatively impacts demand.  

#commodities to the ground today
132 2018-06-04 14:58:56 essential commodities are low at 2013 rates so cong is planning to increase it by farmers agitation so that can blame bjp, price rise will hurt the landless, dalits & daily wage people, where are the well wishers of Dalits cant they see, Cong is plotting for their misery
133 2018-06-04 14:50:31 Many commodities have seasonal demand cycles. Countries can have the same if they are heavy in sensitive sectors. Stocks can have earnings seasonality - all may reflect investor initial underreaction to information. This is what many believe helps make momentum work as well.

169 2018-06-04 12:09:12 Nigeria’s maternal mortality ratio of 576 of every 100,000 livebirths is embarrassing. Functional health facilities with skilled birth attendants, blood banks, and life-saving commodities will help change this narrative. #FundNaijaHealth

181 2018-06-04 10:50:57 I think you'd be surprised if you looked a bit harder. Oats, corn, beans, and pulses really are not rare or luxury commodities. I live in a rural town of 1k ppl, I can buy all those things here. It's probably more a case of won't than can't but it's yr conscience.
182 2018-06-04 10:49:46 Let's go back to 4 provinces, privatise all SOE, 40% import duties on all agricultural commodities, create duty free industrial zones, use renewables to drive energy costs down and stop the illegal outflow of capital
183 2018-06-04 10:48:39 #stocks The most interesting investments are those that are at the same time undervalued and trending up. Do commodities fit into this category?
184 2018-06-04 10:47:27 No farmer protests happening anywhere in the country. Prices of essential commodities are the same as in May. Forced protests by @INCIndia.
185 2018-06-04 10:46:10 @thestalwart Agreed. Economic and trade policies that cater to the least common denominator will be a disaster. America has succeeded because it has moved to an economy based on intellectual capital - not commodities. A move in the opposite direction - no bueno...

199 2018-06-04 09:27:48 #Investing in commodities is not much different than stashing groceries. With a few exceptions such as war or natural disasters, where they become in short supply, it's uneconomical. Commodity booms exist but are rare, every 30 years only, and we just had one 15 years ago.

218 2018-06-04 07:49:30 Trade wars will always affect those who have the least control over international trade. Eg #SMEs and small independent traders.

219 2018-06-04 07:48:17 Totally agree; I’ve thinking about this since early 90’s when a food marketing grad but NZ continues to struggle to match the image (100% pure) to the reality (bulk commodities). If you want to reduce meat consumption, hit fast food first.
220 2018-06-04 07:42:14 Whilst your assertions re the economy are accurate they leave out the very important point that the Howard/Costello years saw us squander the incredible tax windfall we gained due to demand for our commodities- particularly by buying middle class votes

a) Get better at making them, and the regulators bring out clearer guidelines and advice

b) Have more biosimilars on the market...They will become 'commodities' and pricing markets will adjust once competition arises

233 2018-06-04 06:28:08 So Twiggy Forrest & international mates plan to build $300 million LNG import terminal at Wollongong to service up to 70% NSW's gas needs.
Australia is one of world's largest exporters of cheap gas.
Stuff sovereign risk, time to nationalize Australia's energy commodities #auspol
234 2018-06-04 06:18:49 If over commodities/etc, I agree.

If over the well-being of nations, I would disagree.

238 2018-06-04 06:05:11 Petrol is Rs 44 in Indonesia and well well well what is the hotel cost you are paying,what is the groceries price I mean commodities price ??? Restaurant prices ???
239 2018-06-04 05:14:21 This is a good transparent system, Karnataka APMC is using for few commodities, but need awareness drive by State Governments for end to end system usesage by farmers and traders
240 2018-06-04 05:09:29 That it is the cause of surging prices of commodities, now Russia and Saudi looking at producing more oil, hence petrol co now doing rollbacks. So where Train stands here?
241 2018-06-04 05:04:48 Problem is that there is such vast capacity that the excess surplus is pushing prices down. When they lend you see the inflation pressure in commodities
242 2018-06-04 05:00:02 Commodities: Ethanol -1.57%, Cotton +1.04%
243 2018-06-04 04:58:58 #Gold prices steadied early on #Monday, after falling to the lowest in more than a week in the previous session,as expectations of aninterest rate hike this month offset support from worries about a trade war ForeMore Update MissCall This No.@6262524222 #Commodities #marketupdate
244 2018-06-04 04:48:57 Its more about the implosion of the USD than demand for commodities, IMWO.  #USDcrash
245 2018-06-04 04:48:36 Thank you supporting the move!!!
Even today in 2018 the govt cannot subsidize fuel but look at scenarios which we are living in today!!!
Those days we had shortage of fuel & 2day we have surplus
Those days we had to high price on daily commodities & 2day v don't
246 2018-06-04 04:19:21  @Beesoninc. Good listen for those that dable in the dark arts of managing what Mother Nature provides against ‘customers’ who are risk averse but equipped with #hindsight. Nice to hear Dane Andersen and his  analogy for #riskmanagement. #Commodities #pricemakerpricetaker
247 2018-06-04 03:59:55 Still a big year ahead for commodities. In particular uranium, gold and silver due to run imo
248 2018-06-04 03:56:18 Hi Robert, thank you for the update. These are top four commodities or technologies, selected by the PARIs early 2017, that were distributed to farmers and there is evidence of impact. A revised version can be shared by end of 2018.
249 2018-06-04 03:51:16 Vou sonhar com commodities e espero ir bem na prova amanhã
250 2018-06-04 03:42:35 Reminiscing at length in her utility room in an upscale neighborhood of Lynchburg, Jovita Green doesn't come off as a longtime commodities sales agent.
251 2018-06-04 03:33:34 Obliged, actually. My schtick is commodities which sort of preclude this, as to be a commodity one must first not be a security.
252 2018-06-04 03:27:02 IAT will be used to notice volatility in the expense of the merchant's commodities and benefits #IAT #ICO
253 2018-06-04 03:15:41 In our Madhya Pradesh BJP Government is giving 2000Rs Per Quintol for Wheat and much more prices for other agricultural commodities.
254 2018-06-04 03:13:23 Drugs do not relax you, they reinforce your violent addiction to capitalist commodities.
255 2018-06-04 03:13:14 Only way to preserve n propagate democracy: major democratic countries should impose a 25pct tariff on any imports (save maybe commodities) from autocratic nations. This is only way out.
256 2018-06-04 03:12:51 “The reader donates his time and attention, which are supremely valuable commodities. In return, you the writer must give him something worthy of his gift to you.”

257 2018-06-04 03:08:59 Um thats kind of what hedge fund people do ( those of all nationalities and they do it to all currencies/ companies and commodities) Its called free market capitalism. Nothing to do with patriotism or otherwise.
258 2018-06-04 02:53:07 Well, why do you encourage your workers to spill milk on roads when it can be used to feed poor kids? Throwing vegetables? By doing such agitation opposition is holding citizens at ransom if commodities don't reach the urban consumers
259 2018-06-04 02:47:33 Since Modi took the helm of India,the common man face the slow Death under high prices for essential Commodities. No sign of relief at sight. Still BJP Claim of 4 years misrule as a great success! They have ruined Indian socioeconomic culture beyond doubts.
260 2018-06-04 02:46:13 Es decir el limite p TODOS los mercados seria un $WTI en 61. Y para sostenerlo deben dejar subir al $ORO p frenar la presion del $USDollar sobre $Commodities
261 2018-06-04 02:45:25 Es decir, para q $Argentina sea esta correccion actual a una $Crisis como 2001, deberia estar acompanada d un $Indice d Commodities debajo d 193/191 area. Ahi si estariamos hablando x dar un eje d una $BFR debajo d 10. Por eso es import el CONTEXTO internac y q baje $USDollar
262 2018-06-04 02:40:15 The corporate definition of love is obsessed with commodities, property, and hoarding of things and experiences.
263 2018-06-04 02:37:09 Digital Ticks seeks to enable the trading of commodities to crypto pairs on its platform, enabling traders who use both options to have an integrated approach

264 2018-06-04 02:33:57 Somos exportadores de commodities: cae el precio del arroz, tenes una mala cosecha de soja, tenes un brote de aftosa: tu Ingreso y tu PBI caen, tu deficit fiscal vuela, pierdes investment grade, te duplican el costo de los intereses, ergo: deffault total. PBI, castillo de naipes
265 2018-06-04 02:33:26 Since Modi become PM " Ache Din" to all business men."'Bure Din" to common man. Essential Commodities are at sky rocket prices.Still farmers commit suicides and agitates! Modi is Rich man friendly and Brand Ambassador's of Big business Houses.
266 2018-06-04 02:32:24 Ahora hay q ver el resto d variables, espec $Commodities y $MONEDAS.
267 2018-06-04 02:30:35 Our Politicial System is riddled with bugs; thrive to exploit & dont recognise #Nation as such, only as protected commodities to exploit more even tacitly supported by rivals! Media & Politicians splash about this cesspool. #Modi wave upset this, but gave Nation hope-How long?

269 2018-06-04 02:18:25 I think India wants :
1 Educated Leaders
2 More Employment opps
3 Lower prices of essential commodities
4 More opps for women
5 Corruption free nation
6 Honest politicians who mean what they say
7 Compassionate leadership
8 Better Education & Public Health  #IndiaWantsRamMandir
270 2018-06-04 02:13:03 En su analisis debe incluir el cambio en $Commodities q te lleva a suba en $Metales&mineria dde SI coincido.
Pero los problemas $Europa y $DB no son sorpresas p el mercado. Ya esta descontado y la baja del $Euro d ultimos meses tbn es producto d ello. Como paso ANTES del $Brexit
271 2018-06-04 02:10:23 This is correct.  However, all the other patterns of 2008 are repeating themselves.  Oil & commodities top out mid year, market peaks early in the year.  The signs are there elsewhere
272 2018-06-04 02:08:06 ella dice: "Marx’s analysis of commodities as the elementary form of capitalist  wealth can thus be understood as an interpretation of the status of  woman in so-called partriarchal societies."
273 2018-06-04 02:03:11 I’m sure if we were to look at it that way we’d have to look at all the exports coming and going through BC and our coast. Let’s not forget, this is about a toxic, flammable sludge that you want to ship through our city everyday! Very different from the other commodities!
274 2018-06-04 01:58:32 Need to find someone to research various stocks and commodities along with doing specific market research on individual sectors and industries. Other opportunities may be available for the right individual. Let's talk, need someone asap.
275 2018-06-04 01:55:44 Diversify,stocks,cds,treasury bonds,and commodities
276 2018-06-04 01:49:23 Oil trades negative for the 3rd straight day, declined more than 3% last week 
LME base metals index climbed more than 1% last week 
Gold falls below $1300/oz
#Commodities
277 2018-06-04 01:29:16 What you posit applies to equities. It is the opposite with risk-off assets and commodities. Primarily the former.
278 2018-06-04 01:10:00 Thought the film doesn’t speak to it directly, “Americanization” refers to women to exchange sex for wartime commodities that are hard to get

279 2018-06-04 01:07:06 It’s so easy to get caught up in our everyday stress that we forget how blessed we are to even have a bed, clean environment, toiletries, food, plumbing, and purified water. Those basic commodities already make you better off than a lot of the world.
280 2018-06-04 01:04:55 "The Goldman crew believes investors should ignore the naysayers and load up," @IANMCGUGAN on @GoldmanSachs report.  We are glad to see some enthusiasm around the mining space in venerable @globeandmail, but we also urge caution about investing in commodities.

283 2018-06-04 00:51:34 Ignore the opinions of others. Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth. When you have made your decision stick to it. Don't be easily swayed by anyone's opinions. Be a man about it. #djsbubreakfast #massivmetro
284 2018-06-04 00:45:48 Con ese argumento vacío convencieron a la masa , pero no a alguien que a sido trader financiero de diferentes instrumentos bursátiles (acciones ,divisas , commodities)...

Seré franco duque ganara , pero lo lograron el voto popular con mentiras eso usted en el fondo lo sabe .

287 2018-06-04 00:33:35 Yes. Gifts and commodities are treated distinctly almost everywhere, and though the boundaries are porous, assuming the former follow the rules of the latter is just dumb. Or, evil. On that, see @davidgraeber 's Debt.
288 2018-06-04 00:28:00 IT IS BECAUSE EMPLOYEES CANNOT AFFORD TO WORK ANYMORE IN A VERY LOW SALARY CONSIDERING THE TOO HIGH PRICES NOW OF BASIC COMMODITIES. DUTERTE FAILED IN CONTROLLING PRICES. MAYBE BECAUSE HE IS IN CAHOOTS WITH BUSINESSMEN.
289 2018-06-04 00:13:46 Very true. If it's a People's Govt, taxes on essential commodities shd be reduced. If petrol diesel prices were not reduced when international prices were low, why shd they be increased when intl prices go up?
